what actually works there there's a
 

441
00:09:18,500 --> 00:09:22,810
what actually works there there's a
range of legitimate dispute I mean any

I have a pretty strong view that the
 

457
00:09:42,560 --> 00:09:46,269
I have a pretty strong view that the
evidence is points to a conclusions that

458
00:09:46,269 --> 00:09:46,279
evidence is points to a conclusions that
 

459

evidence is points to a conclusions that
are considerably to the left of where

there is legitimate room for

00:09:53,810 --> 00:09:58,360
there is legitimate room for
disagreement on those things so you've

466
00:09:58,360 --> 00:09:58,370
disagreement on those things so you've
 

467
00:09:58,370 --> 00:10:01,030
disagreement on those things so you've
mentioned outcomes what are some metrics

468

mentioned outcomes what are some metrics
 

469
00:10:01,040 --> 00:10:03,280
mentioned outcomes what are some metrics
you think about the keep in mind like

470
00:10:03,280 --> 00:10:03,290
you think about the keep in mind like
 

471
00:10:03,290 --> 00:10:05,259
you think about the keep in mind like
the Gini coefficient but really anything

472
00:10:05,259 --> 00:10:05,269
the Gini coefficient but really anything
 

473
00:10:05,269 --> 00:10:08,550
the Gini coefficient but really anything
that measures how good we're doing

that measures how good we're doing
 

475
00:10:08,560 --> 00:10:10,900
that measures how good we're doing
whatever we're trying to do well what

whatever we're trying to do well what
 

477
00:10:10,910 --> 00:10:12,850
whatever we're trying to do well what
are the metrics to keep an eye on well

478
00:10:12,850 --> 00:10:12,860
are the metrics to keep an eye on well
 

479
00:10:12,860 --> 00:10:15,639
are the metrics to keep an eye on well
I'm actually I'm not a fan of the Gini

480
00:10:15,639 --> 00:10:15,649
I'm actually I'm not a fan of the Gini
 

481
00:10:15,649 --> 00:10:17,920
I'm actually I'm not a fan of the Gini
coefficient not because what is the Gini

482
00:10:17,920 --> 00:10:17,930

483
00:10:17,930 --> 00:10:19,960
coefficient not because what is the Gini
coefficient okay the Gini coefficient is

484
00:10:19,960 --> 00:10:19,970
coefficient okay the Gini coefficient is
 

485
00:10:19,970 --> 00:10:20,710
coefficient okay the Gini coefficient is
a

486
00:10:20,710 --> 00:10:20,720
a
 

487
00:10:20,720 --> 00:10:23,470
a
measure of inequality and it is commonly

488
00:10:23,470 --> 00:10:23,480
measure of inequality and it is commonly
 

489
00:10:23,480 --> 00:10:25,150
measure of inequality and it is commonly
used because it's a single number

490
00:10:25,150 --> 00:10:25,160
used because it's a single number
 

491
00:10:25,160 --> 00:10:28,600
used because it's a single number
it usually tracks with other measures

492
00:10:28,600 --> 00:10:28,610
it usually tracks with other measures
 

493
00:10:28,610 --> 00:10:30,309
it usually tracks with other measures
but the trouble is there's no sort of

494
00:10:30,309 --> 00:10:30,319
but the trouble is there's no sort of
 

495
00:10:30,319 --> 00:10:35,379
but the trouble is there's no sort of
natural interpretation of it you ask me

496
00:10:35,379 --> 00:10:35,389
natural interpretation of it you ask me
 

497
00:10:35,389 --> 00:10:38,110
natural interpretation of it you ask me
what you know what what does a society

498
00:10:38,110 --> 00:10:38,120
what you know what what does a society
 

499
00:10:38,120 --> 00:10:41,170
what you know what what does a society
with the genie of 0.45 look like as

500
00:10:41,170 --> 00:10:41,180
with the genie of 0.45 look like as
 

501
00:10:41,180 --> 00:10:43,360
with the genie of 0.45 look like as
opposed to society with a genie of 0.25

502
00:10:43,360 --> 00:10:43,370
opposed to society with a genie of 0.25
 

503
00:10:43,370 --> 00:10:46,780
opposed to society with a genie of 0.25
and well I can kind of tell you you know

504
00:10:46,780 --> 00:10:46,790
and well I can kind of tell you you know
 

505
00:10:46,790 --> 00:10:50,019
and well I can kind of tell you you know
when the 0.25 is Denmark and 0.45 is

506
00:10:50,019 --> 00:10:50,029
when the 0.25 is Denmark and 0.45 is
 

507
00:10:50,029 --> 00:10:53,319
when the 0.25 is Denmark and 0.45 is
Brazil but it's that's a really there's

508
00:10:53,319 --> 00:10:53,329
Brazil but it's that's a really there's
 

509
00:10:53,329 --> 00:10:56,319
Brazil but it's that's a really there's
no sort of easy way to do that mapping I

510
00:10:56,319 --> 00:10:56,329
no sort of easy way to do that mapping I
 

511
00:10:56,329 --> 00:10:59,369
no sort of easy way to do that mapping I
mean I I look at things like what is

512
00:10:59,369 --> 00:10:59,379
mean I I look at things like what is
 

513
00:10:59,379 --> 00:11:01,829
mean I I look at things like what is
first of all things like what is the

514
00:11:01,829 --> 00:11:01,839
first of all things like what is the
 

515
00:11:01,839 --> 00:11:08,259
first of all things like what is the
income of the the the median family what

516
00:11:08,259 --> 00:11:08,269
income of the the the median family what
 

517
00:11:08,269 --> 00:11:10,809
income of the the the median family what
is the income of the top 1% how many

518
00:11:10,809 --> 00:11:10,819
is the income of the top 1% how many
 

519
00:11:10,819 --> 00:11:13,179
is the income of the top 1% how many
people are in poverty by various

520
00:11:13,179 --> 00:11:13,189
people are in poverty by various
 

521
00:11:13,189 --> 00:11:15,819
people are in poverty by various
measures of poverty and then I think we

522
00:11:15,819 --> 00:11:15,829
measures of poverty and then I think we
 

523
00:11:15,829 --> 00:11:21,910
measures of poverty and then I think we
want to look at questions like how

524
00:11:21,910 --> 00:11:21,920
want to look at questions like how
 

525
00:11:21,920 --> 00:11:27,579
want to look at questions like how
healthy are people how how is life

526
00:11:27,579 --> 00:11:27,589
healthy are people how how is life
 

527
00:11:27,589 --> 00:11:29,590
healthy are people how how is life
expectancy doing and how satisfied are

528
00:11:29,590 --> 00:11:29,600
expectancy doing and how satisfied are
 

529
00:11:29,600 --> 00:11:31,170
expectancy doing and how satisfied are
people with their lives because there is

530
00:11:31,170 --> 00:11:31,180
people with their lives because there is
 

531
00:11:31,180 --> 00:11:33,850
people with their lives because there is
it's that they has sounds like a squishy

532
00:11:33,850 --> 00:11:33,860
it's that they has sounds like a squishy
 

533
00:11:33,860 --> 00:11:35,499
it's that they has sounds like a squishy
number not so much happiness it turns

534
00:11:35,499 --> 00:11:35,509
number not so much happiness it turns
 

535
00:11:35,509 --> 00:11:37,210
number not so much happiness it turns
out that life satisfaction is a better

536
00:11:37,210 --> 00:11:37,220
out that life satisfaction is a better
 

537
00:11:37,220 --> 00:11:39,730
out that life satisfaction is a better
measure than the happiness but life

538
00:11:39,730 --> 00:11:39,740
measure than the happiness but life
 

539
00:11:39,740 --> 00:11:41,970
measure than the happiness but life
satisfaction that varies quite a lot and

540
00:11:41,970 --> 00:11:41,980
satisfaction that varies quite a lot and
 

541
00:11:41,980 --> 00:11:45,549
satisfaction that varies quite a lot and
I think it I think it's meaningful if

542
00:11:45,549 --> 00:11:45,559
I think it I think it's meaningful if
 

543
00:11:45,559 --> 00:11:49,540
I think it I think it's meaningful if

they thought they were paying for its
judgment case and it's funny there are

958
00:21:01,740 --> 00:21:01,750
judgment case and it's funny there are
 

959
00:21:01,750 --> 00:21:04,590
judgment case and it's funny there are
things I mean everybody talks if there's

960
00:21:04,590 --> 00:21:04,600
things I mean everybody talks if there's
 

961
00:21:04,600 --> 00:21:08,490
things I mean everybody talks if there's
the talks about the the DMV as being how

962
00:21:08,490 --> 00:21:08,500
the talks about the the DMV as being how
 

963
00:21:08,500 --> 00:21:10,560
the talks about the the DMV as being how
do you want the economy and actually my

964
00:21:10,560 --> 00:21:10,570
do you want the economy and actually my
 

965
00:21:10,570 --> 00:21:12,149
do you want the economy and actually my
experience is that the DMV have always

966
00:21:12,149 --> 00:21:12,159
experience is that the DMV have always
 

967
00:21:12,159 --> 00:21:14,190
experience is that the DMV have always
been positive maybe I'm just going to

968
00:21:14,190 --> 00:21:14,200
been positive maybe I'm just going to
 

969
00:21:14,200 --> 00:21:17,370
been positive maybe I'm just going to
the right DMVs but in fact a lot of

970
00:21:17,370 --> 00:21:17,380
the right DMVs but in fact a lot of
 

971
00:21:17,380 --> 00:21:20,700
the right DMVs but in fact a lot of
government works pretty well so it you'd

972
00:21:20,700 --> 00:21:20,710
government works pretty well so it you'd
 

973
00:21:20,710 --> 00:21:23,520
government works pretty well so it you'd
have to to some extent you can do these

974
00:21:23,520 --> 00:21:23,530
have to to some extent you can do these
 

975
00:21:23,530 --> 00:21:25,740
have to to some extent you can do these
things on a priori grounds you can talk

976
00:21:25,740 --> 00:21:25,750
things on a priori grounds you can talk
 

977
00:21:25,750 --> 00:21:27,420
things on a priori grounds you can talk
about the logic of why healthcare is not

978
00:21:27,420 --> 00:21:27,430
about the logic of why healthcare is not
 

979
00:21:27,430 --> 00:21:29,370
about the logic of why healthcare is not
gonna be handled well by the market but

980
00:21:29,370 --> 00:21:29,380
gonna be handled well by the market but
 

981
00:21:29,380 --> 00:21:32,010
gonna be handled well by the market but
partly is just experience we tried where

982
00:21:32,010 --> 00:21:32,020
partly is just experience we tried where
 

983
00:21:32,020 --> 00:21:33,210
partly is just experience we tried where
these some countries have tried

984
00:21:33,210 --> 00:21:33,220
these some countries have tried
 

985
00:21:33,220 --> 00:21:34,860
these some countries have tried
nationalizing their steel industries

986
00:21:34,860 --> 00:21:34,870
nationalizing their steel industries
 

987
00:21:34,870 --> 00:21:37,350
nationalizing their steel industries
that didn't go well but we've tried

988
00:21:37,350 --> 00:21:37,360
that didn't go well but we've tried
 

989
00:21:37,360 --> 00:21:39,480
that didn't go well but we've tried
privatizing education and that didn't go

990
00:21:39,480 --> 00:21:39,490
privatizing education and that didn't go
 

991
00:21:39,490 --> 00:21:43,380
privatizing education and that didn't go
well so you'd find out what works what

992
00:21:43,380 --> 00:21:43,390
well so you'd find out what works what
 

993
00:21:43,390 --> 00:21:46,620
well so you'd find out what works what
about this new world of tech how do you

994
00:21:46,620 --> 00:21:46,630
about this new world of tech how do you
 

995
00:21:46,630 --> 00:21:49,380
about this new world of tech how do you
see what do you think works for tech is

996
00:21:49,380 --> 00:21:49,390
see what do you think works for tech is
 

997
00:21:49,390 --> 00:21:51,800
see what do you think works for tech is
a more regulation or less regulation

998
00:21:51,800 --> 00:21:51,810
a more regulation or less regulation
 

999
00:21:51,810 --> 00:21:55,500
a more regulation or less regulation
there are some things that need more

1000
00:21:55,500 --> 00:21:55,510
there are some things that need more
 

1001
00:21:55,510 --> 00:21:58,610
there are some things that need more
regulation and we're finding out that

1002
00:21:58,610 --> 00:21:58,620
regulation and we're finding out that
 

1003
00:21:58,620 --> 00:22:01,680
regulation and we're finding out that

1017
00:22:18,520 --> 00:22:20,520
think the tech doesn't work and it
doesn't do stuff but the idea that we're

1018
00:22:20,520 --> 00:22:20,530
doesn't do stuff but the idea that we're
 

1019
00:22:20,530 --> 00:22:22,380
doesn't do stuff but the idea that we're

may be some things I mean actually
 

1069
00:23:33,550 --> 00:23:35,760

translators there's really reduced
 

1071
00:23:35,770 --> 00:23:38,930
translators there's really reduced
demand for translators because we've

1072

bad there are some kinds of things that

1076
00:23:45,050 --> 00:23:45,060
bad there are some kinds of things that
 

1077
00:23:45,060 --> 00:23:50,900
bad there are some kinds of things that
are changed but it's not overall

are changed but it's not overall

productivity growth has actually been
 

1081
00:23:53,550 --> 00:23:56,240
productivity growth has actually been
slowed in recent years now it's been

1082
00:23:56,240 --> 00:23:56,250
slowed in recent years now it's been
 

1083
00:23:56,250 --> 00:23:59,870
slowed in recent years now it's been
much slower than in some past periods so

1084
00:23:59,870 --> 00:23:59,880
much slower than in some past periods so
 

1085
00:23:59,880 --> 00:24:01,490
much slower than in some past periods so
the idea that automation is taking away

1086
00:24:01,490 --> 00:24:01,500
the idea that automation is taking away
 

1087
00:24:01,500 --> 00:24:03,560
the idea that automation is taking away
all the jobs the counterpart would be

1088
00:24:03,560 --> 00:24:03,570
all the jobs the counterpart would be
 

1089
00:24:03,570 --> 00:24:05,480
all the jobs the counterpart would be
that we would be able to you know

1090
00:24:05,480 --> 00:24:05,490
that we would be able to you know
 

1091
00:24:05,490 --> 00:24:07,100
that we would be able to you know
produce stuff with many fewer workers

1092
00:24:07,100 --> 00:24:07,110
produce stuff with many fewer workers
 

1093
00:24:07,110 --> 00:24:08,840
produce stuff with many fewer workers
than before and that's not happening

1094
00:24:08,840 --> 00:24:08,850
than before and that's not happening

there are a few isolated you know

1096
00:24:10,700 --> 00:24:10,710
there are a few isolated you know
 

1097
00:24:10,710 --> 00:24:13,910
there are a few isolated you know
sectors there are some kinds of jobs

1098
00:24:13,910 --> 00:24:13,920
sectors there are some kinds of jobs
 

1099
00:24:13,920 --> 00:24:15,590
sectors there are some kinds of jobs
that that are going with but that keeps

00:24:30,260 --> 00:24:30,270
almost all gone now now you have these

that's not robots it's doesn't doesn't

1116
00:24:40,640 --> 00:24:40,650
that's not robots it's doesn't doesn't
 

1117
00:24:40,650 --> 00:24:43,100
that's not robots it's doesn't doesn't
sound high-tech but it actually pretty

1118
00:24:43,100 --> 00:24:43,110
sound high-tech but it actually pretty
 

1119
00:24:43,110 --> 00:24:46,670
sound high-tech but it actually pretty
much destroyed that occupation well you

1120
00:24:46,670 --> 00:24:46,680
much destroyed that occupation well you
 

1121
00:24:46,680 --> 00:24:48,380
much destroyed that occupation well you
know that was it wasn't fun for the

1122
00:24:48,380 --> 00:24:48,390
know that was it wasn't fun for the
 

1123
00:24:48,390 --> 00:24:50,360
know that was it wasn't fun for the
longshoremen to say the least and but it

1124
00:24:50,360 --> 00:24:50,370
longshoremen to say the least and but it
 

1125
00:24:50,370 --> 00:24:55,610
longshoremen to say the least and but it
it's not we coped we moved on and that

1126
00:24:55,610 --> 00:24:55,620
it's not we coped we moved on and that
 

1127
00:24:55,620 --> 00:24:57,560
it's not we coped we moved on and that
that sort of thing happens all the time

1128
00:24:57,560 --> 00:24:57,570
that sort of thing happens all the time
 

1129
00:24:57,570 --> 00:25:01,340
that sort of thing happens all the time
you mean farmers we we used to be a

1130
00:25:01,340 --> 00:25:01,350
you mean farmers we we used to be a
 

1131
00:25:01,350 --> 00:25:03,290
you mean farmers we we used to be a
nation which was mostly farmers there

1132
00:25:03,290 --> 00:25:03,300
nation which was mostly farmers there
 

1133
00:25:03,300 --> 00:25:07,370
nation which was mostly farmers there
are now very few farmers left the end

1134
00:25:07,370 --> 00:25:07,380
are now very few farmers left the end
 

1135
00:25:07,380 --> 00:25:11,000
are now very few farmers left the end
the reason is not that we've stopped

1136
00:25:11,000 --> 00:25:11,010
the reason is not that we've stopped
 

1137
00:25:11,010 --> 00:25:13,040
the reason is not that we've stopped
eating it's that farming has become so

1138
00:25:13,040 --> 00:25:13,050
eating it's that farming has become so
 

1139
00:25:13,050 --> 00:25:14,420
eating it's that farming has become so
efficient that we don't need a lot of

1140
00:25:14,420 --> 00:25:14,430
efficient that we don't need a lot of
 

1141
00:25:14,430 --> 00:25:17,000
efficient that we don't need a lot of
farmers and cope with that too so the

1142
00:25:17,000 --> 00:25:17,010
farmers and cope with that too so the
 

1143
00:25:17,010 --> 00:25:18,370
farmers and cope with that too so the
the idea that there's something

1144
00:25:18,370 --> 00:25:18,380
the idea that there's something
 

1145
00:25:18,380 --> 00:25:20,810
the idea that there's something
qualitatively different about what's

1146
00:25:20,810 --> 00:25:20,820
qualitatively different about what's
 

1147
00:25:20,820 --> 00:25:24,530
qualitatively different about what's
happening now so far isn't true you see

1148
00:25:24,530 --> 00:25:24,540
happening now so far isn't true you see
 

1149
00:25:24,540 --> 00:25:26,750
happening now so far isn't true you see
yeah your intuition is there is going to

1150
00:25:26,750 --> 00:25:26,760
yeah your intuition is there is going to
 

1151
00:25:26,760 --> 00:25:28,460
yeah your intuition is there is going to
be a loss of jobs but it's just the

1152
00:25:28,460 --> 00:25:28,470
be a loss of jobs but it's just the
 

1153
00:25:28,470 --> 00:25:30,110
be a loss of jobs but it's just the
thing that just continues though you

1154
00:25:30,110 --> 00:25:30,120
thing that just continues though you
 

1155
00:25:30,120 --> 00:25:31,880
thing that just continues though you
know there's nothing qualitatively

1156
00:25:31,880 --> 00:25:31,890
know there's nothing qualitatively
 

1157
00:25:31,890 --> 00:25:33,560
know there's nothing qualitatively
different about this moment some jobs

1158
00:25:33,560 --> 00:25:33,570
different about this moment some jobs
 

1159
00:25:33,570 --> 00:25:35,480
different about this moment some jobs
will be lost others will be created as

1160
00:25:35,480 --> 00:25:35,490
will be lost others will be created as
 

1161
00:25:35,490 --> 00:25:37,160
will be lost others will be created as
has always been the case so far

1162
00:25:37,160 --> 00:25:37,170
has always been the case so far
 

1163
00:25:37,170 --> 00:25:39,080
has always been the case so far
maybe there's a singularity maybe

1164
00:25:39,080 --> 00:25:39,090
maybe there's a singularity maybe
 

1165
00:25:39,090 --> 00:25:41,690
maybe there's a singularity maybe
there's a moment when when the machines

1166
00:25:41,690 --> 00:25:41,700
there's a moment when when the machines
 

1167
00:25:41,700 --> 00:25:44,360
there's a moment when when the machines
get smarter than we are and sky tech

1168
00:25:44,360 --> 00:25:44,370
get smarter than we are and sky tech
 

1169
00:25:44,370 --> 00:25:45,920
get smarter than we are and sky tech
kills us all or something right but the

1170
00:25:45,920 --> 00:25:45,930
kills us all or something right but the
 

1171
00:25:45,930 --> 00:25:49,370
kills us all or something right but the
but that's not visible in anything we're

1172
00:25:49,370 --> 00:25:49,380
but that's not visible in anything we're
 

1173
00:25:49,380 --> 00:25:50,570
but that's not visible in anything we're
seeing now

1174
00:25:50,570 --> 00:25:50,580
seeing now
 

1175
00:25:50,580 --> 00:25:52,800
seeing now
you mentioned the metric of productivity

1176
00:25:52,800 --> 00:25:52,810
you mentioned the metric of productivity
 

1177
00:25:52,810 --> 00:25:54,000
you mentioned the metric of productivity
could you explain that a little bit

1178
00:25:54,000 --> 00:25:54,010
could you explain that a little bit
 

1179
00:25:54,010 --> 00:25:55,230
could you explain that a little bit
because it's a really interesting one

1180
00:25:55,230 --> 00:25:55,240
because it's a really interesting one
 

1181
00:25:55,240 --> 00:25:57,000
because it's a really interesting one
I've heard you mentioned that before

1182
00:25:57,000 --> 00:25:57,010
I've heard you mentioned that before
 

1183
00:25:57,010 --> 00:26:00,000
I've heard you mentioned that before
the in connection with with automation

1184
00:26:00,000 --> 00:26:00,010
the in connection with with automation
 

1185
00:26:00,010 --> 00:26:02,790
the in connection with with automation
so what what is that metric and if there

1186
00:26:02,790 --> 00:26:02,800
so what what is that metric and if there
 

1187
00:26:02,800 --> 00:26:04,500
so what what is that metric and if there
is something qualitatively different

1188
00:26:04,500 --> 00:26:04,510
is something qualitatively different
 

1189
00:26:04,510 --> 00:26:06,930
is something qualitatively different
what should we see in that metric well

1190
00:26:06,930 --> 00:26:06,940
what should we see in that metric well
 

1191
00:26:06,940 --> 00:26:08,790
what should we see in that metric well
okay productivity first of all

1192
00:26:08,790 --> 00:26:08,800
okay productivity first of all
 

1193
00:26:08,800 --> 00:26:11,520
okay productivity first of all
production we do have a measure of the

1194
00:26:11,520 --> 00:26:11,530
production we do have a measure of the
 

1195
00:26:11,530 --> 00:26:12,960
production we do have a measure of the
total the economy's total production

1196
00:26:12,960 --> 00:26:12,970
total the economy's total production
 

1197
00:26:12,970 --> 00:26:17,100
total the economy's total production
real GDP which is it's not that it's a

1198
00:26:17,100 --> 00:26:17,110
real GDP which is it's not that it's a
 

1199
00:26:17,110 --> 00:26:18,960
real GDP which is it's not that it's a
little bit of a construct because it's

1200
00:26:18,960 --> 00:26:18,970
little bit of a construct because it's
 

1201
00:26:18,970 --> 00:26:21,390
little bit of a construct because it's
quite literally it's adding apples and

1202
00:26:21,390 --> 00:26:21,400
quite literally it's adding apples and
 

1203
00:26:21,400 --> 00:26:23,820
quite literally it's adding apples and
oranges so we have to add together

1204
00:26:23,820 --> 00:26:23,830
oranges so we have to add together
 

1205
00:26:23,830 --> 00:26:25,500
oranges so we have to add together
various things which we basically do by

1206
00:26:25,500 --> 00:26:25,510
various things which we basically do by
 

1207
00:26:25,510 --> 00:26:28,380
various things which we basically do by
using market prices but we try to adjust

1208
00:26:28,380 --> 00:26:28,390
using market prices but we try to adjust
 

1209
00:26:28,390 --> 00:26:31,530
using market prices but we try to adjust
for inflation but it's kind of it's a

1210
00:26:31,530 --> 00:26:31,540
for inflation but it's kind of it's a
 

1211
00:26:31,540 --> 00:26:33,060
for inflation but it's kind of it's a
reasonable measure of how much the

1212
00:26:33,060 --> 00:26:33,070
reasonable measure of how much the
 

1213
00:26:33,070 --> 00:26:35,040
reasonable measure of how much the
economy is producing and goods in sorry

1214
00:26:35,040 --> 00:26:35,050
economy is producing and goods in sorry
 

1215
00:26:35,050 --> 00:26:36,690
economy is producing and goods in sorry
to interrupt is a goods and services and

1216
00:26:36,690 --> 00:26:36,700
to interrupt is a goods and services and
 

1217
00:26:36,700 --> 00:26:38,280
to interrupt is a goods and services and
services it's everything okay

1218
00:26:38,280 --> 00:26:38,290
services it's everything okay
 

1219
00:26:38,290 --> 00:26:42,330
services it's everything okay
productivity is you divide that total

1220
00:26:42,330 --> 00:26:42,340
productivity is you divide that total
 

1221
00:26:42,340 --> 00:26:44,880
productivity is you divide that total
output by the number of hours worked

1222
00:26:44,880 --> 00:26:44,890
output by the number of hours worked
 

1223
00:26:44,890 --> 00:26:47,100
output by the number of hours worked
so we're basically asking how much how

1224
00:26:47,100 --> 00:26:47,110
so we're basically asking how much how
 

1225
00:26:47,110 --> 00:26:50,430
so we're basically asking how much how
much stuff does the average worker

1226
00:26:50,430 --> 00:26:50,440
much stuff does the average worker
 

1227
00:26:50,440 --> 00:26:52,890
much stuff does the average worker
produce an hour of work and if you're

1228
00:26:52,890 --> 00:26:52,900
produce an hour of work and if you're
 

1229
00:26:52,900 --> 00:26:54,510
produce an hour of work and if you're
seeing really rapid technological

1230
00:26:54,510 --> 00:26:54,520
seeing really rapid technological
 

1231
00:26:54,520 --> 00:26:57,060
seeing really rapid technological
progress then you would expect to see

1232
00:26:57,060 --> 00:26:57,070
progress then you would expect to see
 

1233
00:26:57,070 --> 00:27:00,500
progress then you would expect to see
productivity rising at a rapid clip

1234
00:27:00,500 --> 00:27:00,510
productivity rising at a rapid clip
 

1235
00:27:00,510 --> 00:27:03,810
productivity rising at a rapid clip
which we did for in the generation after

1236
00:27:03,810 --> 00:27:03,820
which we did for in the generation after
 

1237
00:27:03,820 --> 00:27:07,620
which we did for in the generation after
World War 2 productivity rose a 2% a

1238
00:27:07,620 --> 00:27:07,630
World War 2 productivity rose a 2% a
 

1239
00:27:07,630 --> 00:27:10,350
World War 2 productivity rose a 2% a
year on a sustained basis then it

1240
00:27:10,350 --> 00:27:10,360
year on a sustained basis then it
 

1241
00:27:10,360 --> 00:27:12,360
year on a sustained basis then it
dropped down for a while then there was

1242
00:27:12,360 --> 00:27:12,370
dropped down for a while then there was
 

1243
00:27:12,370 --> 00:27:14,700
dropped down for a while then there was
a kind of a decade of fairly rapid

1244
00:27:14,700 --> 00:27:14,710
a kind of a decade of fairly rapid
 

1245
00:27:14,710 --> 00:27:17,420
a kind of a decade of fairly rapid
growth from the mid 90s to the mid 2000s

1246
00:27:17,420 --> 00:27:17,430
growth from the mid 90s to the mid 2000s
 

1247
00:27:17,430 --> 00:27:20,160
growth from the mid 90s to the mid 2000s
and then it's it dropped off again and

1248
00:27:20,160 --> 00:27:20,170
and then it's it dropped off again and
 

1249
00:27:20,170 --> 00:27:22,500
and then it's it dropped off again and
it's not it's not impressive right now

1250
00:27:22,500 --> 00:27:22,510
it's not it's not impressive right now
 

1251
00:27:22,510 --> 00:27:25,770
it's not it's not impressive right now
so you're just not seeing an ethical

1252
00:27:25,770 --> 00:27:25,780
so you're just not seeing an ethical
 

1253
00:27:25,780 --> 00:27:29,100
so you're just not seeing an ethical
shift in in in the economy so let me

1254
00:27:29,100 --> 00:27:29,110
shift in in in the economy so let me
 

1255
00:27:29,110 --> 00:27:30,480
shift in in in the economy so let me
then ask you about the psychology of

1256
00:27:30,480 --> 00:27:30,490
then ask you about the psychology of
 

1257
00:27:30,490 --> 00:27:32,940
then ask you about the psychology of
blaming automation a few months ago you

are a big part of the problem that

1274
00:27:50,010 --> 00:27:50,020
are a big part of the problem that
 

1275
00:27:50,020 --> 00:27:52,470
are a big part of the problem that
machines are taken away the good jobs or

even jobs in general for the most part
this wasn't even a presented as a

this wasn't even a presented as a
 

1281
00:27:56,440 --> 00:27:59,010
this wasn't even a presented as a
hypothesis just as part of what everyone

1282
00:27:59,010 --> 00:27:59,020
hypothesis just as part of what everyone
 

1283
00:27:59,020 --> 00:28:03,090

1299
00:28:20,040 --> 00:28:22,740
there's a couple of things one is that
the particular technologies that are

1300
00:28:22,740 --> 00:28:22,750
the particular technologies that are
 

1301
00:28:22,750 --> 00:28:25,560
the particular technologies that are
advancing now are ones that are a lot

1302
00:28:25,560 --> 00:28:25,570
advancing now are ones that are a lot
 

1303
00:28:25,570 --> 00:28:30,570
advancing now are ones that are a lot
more visible to the chattering class the

1304
00:28:30,570 --> 00:28:30,580
more visible to the chattering class the
 

1305
00:28:30,580 --> 00:28:33,590
more visible to the chattering class the
you know if when you had a point when

00:28:39,220 --> 00:28:42,780
college professors are close friends
with longshoremen right and so so we see

1314
00:28:42,780 --> 00:28:42,790
with longshoremen right and so so we see
 

1315
00:28:42,790 --> 00:28:46,170
with longshoremen right and so so we see
this one then there is a second thing

about social safety net programs there's
 

1557
00:34:04,130 --> 00:34:08,490
about social safety net programs there's
always a trade-off between universality

1558

always a trade-off between universality

which is clean but means that you're

1560
00:34:11,530 --> 00:34:11,540
which is clean but means that you're

00:34:11,540 --> 00:34:12,820
which is clean but means that you're
giving a lot of money to people who

giving a lot of money to people who
 

1563
00:34:12,830 --> 00:34:16,419
giving a lot of money to people who
don't necessarily need it and some kind

1564
00:34:16,419 --> 00:34:16,429
don't necessarily need it and some kind
 

1565
00:34:16,429 --> 00:34:20,010
don't necessarily need it and some kind
of targeting which makes it easier to

1566
00:34:20,010 --> 00:34:20,020
of targeting which makes it easier to
 

1567
00:34:20,020 --> 00:34:23,350
of targeting which makes it easier to
get to deal with the crucial problems

1568
00:34:23,350 --> 00:34:23,360
get to deal with the crucial problems
 

1569
00:34:23,360 --> 00:34:27,040
get to deal with the crucial problems
with limited resources but but both has

1570
00:34:27,040 --> 00:34:27,050
with limited resources but but both has
 

1571
00:34:27,050 --> 00:34:31,210
with limited resources but but both has
incentive problems and kind of political

1572
00:34:31,210 --> 00:34:31,220
incentive problems and kind of political
 

1573
00:34:31,220 --> 00:34:33,310
incentive problems and kind of political
and I would say even psychological

00:34:33,310 --> 00:34:33,320
and I would say even psychological
 

1575
00:34:33,320 --> 00:34:37,210

so take economics is something where I

1804
00:40:16,990 --> 00:40:17,000
so take economics is something where I
 

1805
00:40:17,000 --> 00:40:19,450
so take economics is something where I
think I know something and I'm not sure

1806
00:40:19,450 --> 00:40:19,460
think I know something and I'm not sure
 

1807
00:40:19,460 --> 00:40:20,950

I've been wrong plenty of times but I
 

1811
00:40:24,920 --> 00:40:27,420
I've been wrong plenty of times but I
think there is a difference between

1812
00:40:27,420 --> 00:40:27,430
think there is a difference between
 

1813
00:40:27,430 --> 00:40:31,120
think there is a difference between
economic views that are within the realm

1814
00:40:31,120 --> 00:40:31,130
economic views that are within the realm
 

1815

are just crank doctrines or things that
that are purely being disseminated

1822
00:40:43,540 --> 00:40:43,550
that are purely being disseminated
 

1823
00:40:43,550 --> 00:40:45,130
that are purely being disseminated
because people are being paid to

economics let me linger on that point so

1852
00:41:22,420 --> 00:41:22,430
economics let me linger on that point so
 

1853
00:41:22,430 --> 00:41:24,610
economics let me linger on that point so
if you look at Iran okay

I'm just sort of curious about how open
 

1865
00:41:40,670 --> 00:41:43,660
I'm just sort of curious about how open
we should be to ideas that seem radical

1866
00:41:43,660 --> 00:41:43,670
we should be to ideas that seem radical
 

1867

evidence again and again and people just
 

1883
00:42:06,350 --> 00:42:08,530
evidence again and again and people just

00:42:08,540 --> 00:42:10,950
keep saying if it's a zombie idea and
there's a lot of those out there then

1886
00:42:10,950 --> 00:42:10,960
there's a lot of those out there then
 

1887
00:42:10,960 --> 00:42:13,380
there's a lot of those out there then
there comes a point when it's not worth

1888
00:42:13,380 --> 00:42:13,390
there comes a point when it's not worth
 

1889
00:42:13,390 --> 00:42:15,910
there comes a point when it's not worth
trying to fake respect for it

1890
00:42:15,910 --> 00:42:15,920
trying to fake respect for it
 

1891
00:42:15,920 --> 00:42:18,010
trying to fake respect for it
I see so there's a through the

1892
00:42:18,010 --> 00:42:18,020
I see so there's a through the
 

1893
00:42:18,020 --> 00:42:19,930
I see so there's a through the
scientific process you've shown that

1894
00:42:19,930 --> 00:42:19,940
scientific process you've shown that
 

1895
00:42:19,940 --> 00:42:23,140
scientific process you've shown that
this idea does not hold water but I like

1896
00:42:23,140 --> 00:42:23,150
this idea does not hold water but I like
 

1897
00:42:23,150 --> 00:42:25,060
this idea does not hold water but I like
the idea zombie ideas but they live on

1898
00:42:25,060 --> 00:42:25,070
the idea zombie ideas but they live on
 

1899
00:42:25,070 --> 00:42:28,120
the idea zombie ideas but they live on
through it's like the idea that the

1900
00:42:28,120 --> 00:42:28,130
through it's like the idea that the
 

1901
00:42:28,130 --> 00:42:31,510
through it's like the idea that the
earth is flat for example has been for

1902
00:42:31,510 --> 00:42:31,520
earth is flat for example has been for
 

1903
00:42:31,520 --> 00:42:34,240
earth is flat for example has been for
the most part that's proven yeah but it

1904
00:42:34,240 --> 00:42:34,250
the most part that's proven yeah but it
 

1905
00:42:34,250 --> 00:42:36,070
the most part that's proven yeah but it
lives on actually is growing in

lives on actually is growing in
 

1907
00:42:36,080 --> 00:42:39,310
lives on actually is growing in
popularity currently yeah and there's a

1908
00:42:39,310 --> 00:42:39,320
popularity currently yeah and there's a
 

1909
00:42:39,320 --> 00:42:41,260
popularity currently yeah and there's a
lot of that out there and there you

1910
00:42:41,260 --> 00:42:41,270
lot of that out there and there you
 

1911
00:42:41,270 --> 00:42:44,140
lot of that out there and there you
can't you can't wish it away and it's

can't you can't wish it away and it's
 

1913

2042
00:45:45,970 --> 00:45:45,980
answer is there there's a or what
 

2043
00:45:45,980 --> 00:45:49,120
answer is there there's a or what
I don't follow every part minimum wages

2044
00:45:49,120 --> 00:45:49,130
I don't follow every part minimum wages
 

2045
00:45:49,130 --> 00:45:51,820
I don't follow every part minimum wages
I think there's there's

2046
00:45:51,820 --> 00:45:51,830
I think there's there's
 

2047
00:45:51,830 --> 00:45:54,400
I think there's there's
pretty overwhelming evidence that that a

2048
00:45:54,400 --> 00:45:54,410
pretty overwhelming evidence that that a
 

2049
00:45:54,410 --> 00:45:56,470
pretty overwhelming evidence that that a
modest increase in the minimum wage from

2050
00:45:56,470 --> 00:45:56,480
modest increase in the minimum wage from
 

2051
00:45:56,480 --> 00:46:00,340
modest increase in the minimum wage from
current levels would be would not have

2052
00:46:00,340 --> 00:46:00,350
current levels would be would not have
 

2053
00:46:00,350 --> 00:46:04,560
current levels would be would not have
any noticeable adverse effect on jobs

2054
00:46:04,560 --> 00:46:04,570
any noticeable adverse effect on jobs
 

2055
00:46:04,570 --> 00:46:08,040
any noticeable adverse effect on jobs
but if you asked how high could it go

2056
00:46:08,040 --> 00:46:08,050
but if you asked how high could it go
 

2057
00:46:08,050 --> 00:46:12,480
but if you asked how high could it go
$12 seems pretty safe given what we know

2058
00:46:12,480 --> 00:46:12,490
$12 seems pretty safe given what we know
 

2059
00:46:12,490 --> 00:46:16,080
$12 seems pretty safe given what we know
15 is 15 okay there's some legitimate

2060
00:46:16,080 --> 00:46:16,090
15 is 15 okay there's some legitimate
 

2061
00:46:16,090 --> 00:46:18,520
15 is 15 okay there's some legitimate
disagreement there I think probably but

2062
00:46:18,520 --> 00:46:18,530
disagreement there I think probably but
 

2063
00:46:18,530 --> 00:46:23,290
disagreement there I think probably but
but I can people have a point 20 where

2064
00:46:23,290 --> 00:46:23,300
but I can people have a point 20 where
 

2065
00:46:23,300 --> 00:46:24,940
but I can people have a point 20 where
where is the line at which it starts to

2066
00:46:24,940 --> 00:46:24,950
where is the line at which it starts to
 

2067
00:46:24,950 --> 00:46:27,370
where is the line at which it starts to
become a problem and the answer is truly

2068
00:46:27,370 --> 00:46:27,380
become a problem and the answer is truly
 

2069
00:46:27,380 --> 00:46:29,340
become a problem and the answer is truly
we don't know it's fascinating to try to

2070
00:46:29,340 --> 00:46:29,350
we don't know it's fascinating to try to
 

2071
00:46:29,350 --> 00:46:32,050
we don't know it's fascinating to try to
such a cool economics is cool in that

00:46:32,050 --> 00:46:32,060
such a cool economics is cool in that
 

2073
00:46:32,060 --> 00:46:33,550
such a cool economics is cool in that
sense a you because you're trying to

2074
00:46:33,550 --> 00:46:33,560
sense a you because you're trying to
 

2075
00:46:33,560 --> 00:46:35,590
sense a you because you're trying to
predict something that hasn't been done

2076
00:46:35,590 --> 00:46:35,600
predict something that hasn't been done
 

2077
00:46:35,600 --> 00:46:38,110
predict something that hasn't been done
before the impact the effects of

yeah you're trying you're going

2082
00:46:41,200 --> 00:46:41,210
yeah you're trying you're going
 

2083
00:46:41,210 --> 00:46:43,090
yeah you're trying you're going
out-of-sample and and we have good

2084
00:46:43,090 --> 00:46:43,100
out-of-sample and and we have good
 

2085
00:46:43,100 --> 00:46:46,870
out-of-sample and and we have good
reason to believe that that there are no

2086
00:46:46,870 --> 00:46:46,880
reason to believe that that there are no
 

2087
00:46:46,880 --> 00:46:48,400
reason to believe that that there are no
that it's nonlinear that there comes a

that it's nonlinear that there comes a

00:46:48,410 --> 00:46:49,540
that it's nonlinear that there comes a

2090
00:46:49,540 --> 00:46:49,550
point at which it doesn't work the way
 

2091
00:46:49,550 --> 00:46:53,260
point at which it doesn't work the way
it has in the past so as an economist

2092
00:46:53,260 --> 00:46:53,270
it has in the past so as an economist
 

2093
00:46:53,270 --> 00:46:55,360
it has in the past so as an economist
how do you see science and technological

2094
00:46:55,360 --> 00:46:55,370
how do you see science and technological
 

2095
00:46:55,370 --> 00:46:57,820
how do you see science and technological
innovation when I took various economics

2096
00:46:57,820 --> 00:46:57,830
innovation when I took various economics
 

2097
00:46:57,830 --> 00:47:00,640
innovation when I took various economics
courses in college technological

2098
00:47:00,640 --> 00:47:00,650
courses in college technological
 

2099
00:47:00,650 --> 00:47:03,430
courses in college technological
innovations seem like a no-brainer way

2100
00:47:03,430 --> 00:47:03,440
innovations seem like a no-brainer way
 

2101
00:47:03,440 --> 00:47:06,100
innovations seem like a no-brainer way
of growing an economy and we should

2102
00:47:06,100 --> 00:47:06,110
of growing an economy and we should
 

2103
00:47:06,110 --> 00:47:08,800
of growing an economy and we should
invest in it aggressively yeah I may be

2104
00:47:08,800 --> 00:47:08,810
invest in it aggressively yeah I may be
 

2105
00:47:08,810 --> 00:47:11,400
invest in it aggressively yeah I may be
biased but it seemed like the various

2106
00:47:11,400 --> 00:47:11,410
biased but it seemed like the various
 

2107
00:47:11,410 --> 00:47:13,780
biased but it seemed like the various
ways to grow an economy it seems like

2108
00:47:13,780 --> 00:47:13,790
ways to grow an economy it seems like
 

2109
00:47:13,790 --> 00:47:16,480
ways to grow an economy it seems like
the easiest way especially long term is

2110
00:47:16,480 --> 00:47:16,490
the easiest way especially long term is
 

2111
00:47:16,490 --> 00:47:19,630
the easiest way especially long term is
that correct and if so why aren't we

2112
00:47:19,630 --> 00:47:19,640
that correct and if so why aren't we
 

2113
00:47:19,640 --> 00:47:22,300
that correct and if so why aren't we
doing it more well that's okay

2114
00:47:22,300 --> 00:47:22,310
doing it more well that's okay
 

2115
00:47:22,310 --> 00:47:24,450
doing it more well that's okay
the first question is yeah I mean all

2116
00:47:24,450 --> 00:47:24,460
the first question is yeah I mean all
 

2117
00:47:24,460 --> 00:47:28,840
the first question is yeah I mean all
it's pretty much overwhelming we think

2118
00:47:28,840 --> 00:47:28,850
it's pretty much overwhelming we think
 

2119
00:47:28,850 --> 00:47:30,310
it's pretty much overwhelming we think
we can more or less measure this

2120
00:47:30,310 --> 00:47:30,320
we can more or less measure this
 

2121
00:47:30,320 --> 00:47:31,270
we can more or less measure this
although there are some assumptions

2122
00:47:31,270 --> 00:47:31,280
although there are some assumptions
 

2123
00:47:31,280 --> 00:47:33,940
although there are some assumptions
involved but it's something like 70 to

2124
00:47:33,940 --> 00:47:33,950
involved but it's something like 70 to
 

2125
00:47:33,950 --> 00:47:36,010
involved but it's something like 70 to
80 percent of the growth in per capita

2126
00:47:36,010 --> 00:47:36,020
80 percent of the growth in per capita
 

2127
00:47:36,020 --> 00:47:38,710
80 percent of the growth in per capita
income is is basically the advance of

2128
00:47:38,710 --> 00:47:38,720
income is is basically the advance of
 

2129
00:47:38,720 --> 00:47:40,960
income is is basically the advance of
knowledge it's not just it's not just a

2130
00:47:40,960 --> 00:47:40,970
knowledge it's not just it's not just a
 

2131
00:47:40,970 --> 00:47:43,090
knowledge it's not just it's not just a
crude accumulation of capital it is it

2132
00:47:43,090 --> 00:47:43,100
crude accumulation of capital it is it
 

2133
00:47:43,100 --> 00:47:45,940
crude accumulation of capital it is it
is the fact that we can get smarter a

2134
00:47:45,940 --> 00:47:45,950
is the fact that we can get smarter a
 

2135
00:47:45,950 --> 00:47:48,430
is the fact that we can get smarter a
lot of that by the way is more prosaic

2136
00:47:48,430 --> 00:47:48,440
lot of that by the way is more prosaic
 

2137
00:47:48,440 --> 00:47:52,680
lot of that by the way is more prosaic
kinds of technology so you know we I

2138
00:47:52,680 --> 00:47:52,690
kinds of technology so you know we I
 

2139
00:47:52,690 --> 00:47:54,990
kinds of technology so you know we I
like to talk about things like

2140
00:47:54,990 --> 00:47:55,000
like to talk about things like
 

2141
00:47:55,000 --> 00:47:57,370
like to talk about things like
containerization or you know an earlier

2142
00:47:57,370 --> 00:47:57,380
containerization or you know an earlier
 

2143
00:47:57,380 --> 00:48:02,460
containerization or you know an earlier
period the you know the invention of the

2144
00:48:02,460 --> 00:48:02,470
period the you know the invention of the
 

2145
00:48:02,470 --> 00:48:03,620

and and now all of your deliveries from

2150
00:48:10,670 --> 00:48:10,680
and and now all of your deliveries from
 

2151
00:48:10,680 --> 00:48:12,200
and and now all of your deliveries from
Amazon are made possible by the

2152
00:48:12,200 --> 00:48:12,210
Amazon are made possible by the
 

2153
00:48:12,210 --> 00:48:14,120
Amazon are made possible by the
existence of that technology that the

2154

existence of that technology that the
 

2155
00:48:14,130 --> 00:48:17,450
existence of that technology that the
web stuff is important to but but what

2156
00:48:17,450 --> 00:48:17,460
web stuff is important to but but what
 

2157
00:48:17,460 --> 00:48:19,880
web stuff is important to but but what
would we do without cardboard boxes so

2158
00:48:19,880 --> 00:48:19,890
would we do without cardboard boxes so
 

2159
00:48:19,890 --> 00:48:22,100
would we do without cardboard boxes so
but all of that stuff is really

2160
00:48:22,100 --> 00:48:22,110
but all of that stuff is really
 

2161
00:48:22,110 --> 00:48:24,910
but all of that stuff is really
important in driving economic progress

2162
00:48:24,910 --> 00:48:24,920
important in driving economic progress
 

2163
00:48:24,920 --> 00:48:28,160
important in driving economic progress
why don't we invest more

2164
00:48:28,160 --> 00:48:28,170
why don't we invest more
 

2165
00:48:28,170 --> 00:48:33,470
why don't we invest more
why don't we invest more in you again

2166
00:48:33,470 --> 00:48:33,480
why don't we invest more in you again
 

2167
00:48:33,480 --> 00:48:35,390
why don't we invest more in you again
more prosaic stuff why aren't why

2168
00:48:35,390 --> 00:48:35,400
more prosaic stuff why aren't why
 

2169
00:48:35,400 --> 00:48:37,310
more prosaic stuff why aren't why
haven't we built another goddamn real

2170
00:48:37,310 --> 00:48:37,320
haven't we built another goddamn real

countries trade because they're
 

2493
00:56:19,869 --> 00:56:23,460
