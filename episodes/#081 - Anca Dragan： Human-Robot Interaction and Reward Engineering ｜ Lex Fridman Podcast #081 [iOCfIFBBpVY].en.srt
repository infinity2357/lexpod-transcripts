magical connection there and it made me
realize wow robots can be so much more

234
00:04:52,120 --> 00:04:52,130
realize wow robots can be so much more
 

235
00:04:52,130 --> 00:04:54,340
realize wow robots can be so much more
than things that manipulate objects they

236

the they gave us a sticker that said I
 

253
00:05:16,070 --> 00:05:17,800
the they gave us a sticker that said I
wrote in a self-driving car and I had

254
00:05:17,800 --> 00:05:17,810
wrote in a self-driving car and I had
 

255
00:05:17,810 --> 00:05:20,950
wrote in a self-driving car and I had
this cute little Firefly on yes and our

you had the really cute one yeah and and
 

261
00:05:26,390 --> 00:05:29,230
you had the really cute one yeah and and
I put it on my laptop and I had that for

262
00:05:29,230 --> 00:05:29,240
I put it on my laptop and I had that for
 

263
00:05:29,240 --> 00:05:31,600
I put it on my laptop and I had that for
years until I finally changed my laptop

264
00:05:31,600 --> 00:05:31,610
years until I finally changed my laptop
 

265
00:05:31,610 --> 00:05:34,060
years until I finally changed my laptop
out and you know what about if we walk

266
00:05:34,060 --> 00:05:34,070
out and you know what about if we walk
 

267
00:05:34,070 --> 00:05:36,400
out and you know what about if we walk
back you mention optimization at like

268
00:05:36,400 --> 00:05:36,410
back you mention optimization at like
 

269
00:05:36,410 --> 00:05:39,820
back you mention optimization at like
what beautiful ideas inspired you in

270
00:05:39,820 --> 00:05:39,830
what beautiful ideas inspired you in
 

271
00:05:39,830 --> 00:05:42,940
what beautiful ideas inspired you in
math computer science early on like why

272
00:05:42,940 --> 00:05:42,950
math computer science early on like why
 

273
00:05:42,950 --> 00:05:45,790
math computer science early on like why
get into this field seems like a cold

274
00:05:45,790 --> 00:05:45,800
get into this field seems like a cold
 

275
00:05:45,800 --> 00:05:47,860
get into this field seems like a cold
and boring field of math like what was

276
00:05:47,860 --> 00:05:47,870
and boring field of math like what was
 

277
00:05:47,870 --> 00:05:49,720
and boring field of math like what was
exciting to you about it the thing is I

278
00:05:49,720 --> 00:05:49,730
exciting to you about it the thing is I
 

279
00:05:49,730 --> 00:05:54,250
exciting to you about it the thing is I
liked math from very early on from fifth

280
00:05:54,250 --> 00:05:54,260
liked math from very early on from fifth
 

281
00:05:54,260 --> 00:05:55,990
liked math from very early on from fifth
grade is when I got into the math

282
00:05:55,990 --> 00:05:56,000
grade is when I got into the math
 

283
00:05:56,000 --> 00:05:58,000
grade is when I got into the math
Olympia and all of that are you competed

284
00:05:58,000 --> 00:05:58,010
Olympia and all of that are you competed
 

285
00:05:58,010 --> 00:06:00,190
Olympia and all of that are you competed
yeah this it Romania is like our

286
00:06:00,190 --> 00:06:00,200
yeah this it Romania is like our
 

287
00:06:00,200 --> 00:06:02,230
yeah this it Romania is like our
national sport do you speak I understand

288
00:06:02,230 --> 00:06:02,240
national sport do you speak I understand
 

289
00:06:02,240 --> 00:06:06,310
national sport do you speak I understand
so I got into that fairly early and and

290
00:06:06,310 --> 00:06:06,320
so I got into that fairly early and and
 

291
00:06:06,320 --> 00:06:10,390
so I got into that fairly early and and
it was little maybe to just theory with

292
00:06:10,390 --> 00:06:10,400
it was little maybe to just theory with
 

293
00:06:10,400 --> 00:06:13,120
it was little maybe to just theory with
no kind of I didn't kind of how - didn't

294
00:06:13,120 --> 00:06:13,130
no kind of I didn't kind of how - didn't
 

295
00:06:13,130 --> 00:06:16,180
no kind of I didn't kind of how - didn't
really have a goal and I didn't

296
00:06:16,180 --> 00:06:16,190
really have a goal and I didn't
 

297
00:06:16,190 --> 00:06:17,890
really have a goal and I didn't
understanding which was cool I always

298
00:06:17,890 --> 00:06:17,900
understanding which was cool I always
 

299
00:06:17,900 --> 00:06:19,390
understanding which was cool I always
liked learning and understanding but

300
00:06:19,390 --> 00:06:19,400
liked learning and understanding but
 

301
00:06:19,400 --> 00:06:21,100
liked learning and understanding but
there was no can what am i applying this

302
00:06:21,100 --> 00:06:21,110
there was no can what am i applying this
 

303
00:06:21,110 --> 00:06:22,720
there was no can what am i applying this
understanding to and so I think that's

304
00:06:22,720 --> 00:06:22,730
understanding to and so I think that's
 

305
00:06:22,730 --> 00:06:24,550
understanding to and so I think that's
how I got into more heavily into

306
00:06:24,550 --> 00:06:24,560
how I got into more heavily into
 

307
00:06:24,560 --> 00:06:26,980
how I got into more heavily into
computer science cuz it was it was kind

308
00:06:26,980 --> 00:06:26,990
computer science cuz it was it was kind
 

309
00:06:26,990 --> 00:06:29,740
computer science cuz it was it was kind
of math meets something you can do

310
00:06:29,740 --> 00:06:29,750
of math meets something you can do
 

311
00:06:29,750 --> 00:06:31,600
of math meets something you can do
tangibly in the world do you remember

312
00:06:31,600 --> 00:06:31,610
tangibly in the world do you remember
 

313
00:06:31,610 --> 00:06:33,690
tangibly in the world do you remember
like the first program you've written

314
00:06:33,690 --> 00:06:33,700
like the first program you've written
 

315
00:06:33,700 --> 00:06:36,490
like the first program you've written
okay the first program I've written with

316
00:06:36,490 --> 00:06:36,500
okay the first program I've written with
 

317
00:06:36,500 --> 00:06:40,450
okay the first program I've written with
I kind of do it wasn't cute basic and

318
00:06:40,450 --> 00:06:40,460
I kind of do it wasn't cute basic and
 

319
00:06:40,460 --> 00:06:45,280
I kind of do it wasn't cute basic and
fourth grade and it was drawing like a

320
00:06:45,280 --> 00:06:45,290
fourth grade and it was drawing like a
 

321
00:06:45,290 --> 00:06:49,420
fourth grade and it was drawing like a
circle right yeah you know I don't know

322
00:06:49,420 --> 00:06:49,430
circle right yeah you know I don't know
 

323
00:06:49,430 --> 00:06:51,529
circle right yeah you know I don't know
how to do that anymore

324
00:06:51,529 --> 00:06:51,539
how to do that anymore
 

325
00:06:51,539 --> 00:06:53,609
how to do that anymore
right that's like the first thing that

326
00:06:53,609 --> 00:06:53,619
right that's like the first thing that
 

327
00:06:53,619 --> 00:06:54,899
right that's like the first thing that
they taught me I was like you could take

328
00:06:54,899 --> 00:06:54,909
they taught me I was like you could take
 

329
00:06:54,909 --> 00:06:55,829
they taught me I was like you could take
a special

330
00:06:55,829 --> 00:06:55,839
a special
 

331
00:06:55,839 --> 00:06:57,869
a special
I wouldn't say was an extra isn't a

332
00:06:57,869 --> 00:06:57,879
I wouldn't say was an extra isn't a
 

333
00:06:57,879 --> 00:06:59,339
I wouldn't say was an extra isn't a
sense an extracurricular so you could

00:06:59,349 --> 00:07:02,089
sense an extracurricular so you could
sign up for you know dance or music or

336
00:07:02,089 --> 00:07:02,099
sign up for you know dance or music or
 

337
00:07:02,099 --> 00:07:04,409
sign up for you know dance or music or
programming and I did the programming

338
00:07:04,409 --> 00:07:04,419
programming and I did the programming
 

339
00:07:04,419 --> 00:07:06,359
programming and I did the programming
thing and I was like what what I know

340
00:07:06,359 --> 00:07:06,369
thing and I was like what what I know
 

341
00:07:06,369 --> 00:07:09,170
thing and I was like what what I know
why did you compete in program like

342
00:07:09,170 --> 00:07:09,180
why did you compete in program like
 

343
00:07:09,180 --> 00:07:12,329
why did you compete in program like
these days Romania probably that's like

344
00:07:12,329 --> 00:07:12,339
these days Romania probably that's like
 

345
00:07:12,339 --> 00:07:14,279
these days Romania probably that's like
a big thing there's a program of

346
00:07:14,279 --> 00:07:14,289
a big thing there's a program of
 

347
00:07:14,289 --> 00:07:16,260
a big thing there's a program of
competition hmm what was that did that

348
00:07:16,260 --> 00:07:16,270
competition hmm what was that did that
 

349
00:07:16,270 --> 00:07:18,950
competition hmm what was that did that
touch you at all did a little bit of the

350
00:07:18,950 --> 00:07:18,960
touch you at all did a little bit of the
 

351
00:07:18,960 --> 00:07:22,679
touch you at all did a little bit of the
computer science Olympian but not not as

352
00:07:22,679 --> 00:07:22,689
computer science Olympian but not not as
 

353
00:07:22,689 --> 00:07:24,839
computer science Olympian but not not as
seriously as I did the math Olympiad so

354
00:07:24,839 --> 00:07:24,849
seriously as I did the math Olympiad so
 

355
00:07:24,849 --> 00:07:26,309
seriously as I did the math Olympiad so
is programming yeah it's basically

356
00:07:26,309 --> 00:07:26,319
is programming yeah it's basically
 

357
00:07:26,319 --> 00:07:28,170
is programming yeah it's basically
here's a hard math problem solve it with

358
00:07:28,170 --> 00:07:28,180
here's a hard math problem solve it with
 

359
00:07:28,180 --> 00:07:29,909
here's a hard math problem solve it with
a computer it was kind of yeah it's more

360
00:07:29,909 --> 00:07:29,919
a computer it was kind of yeah it's more
 

361
00:07:29,919 --> 00:07:31,679
a computer it was kind of yeah it's more
like algorithms exactly it's not where's

362
00:07:31,679 --> 00:07:31,689
like algorithms exactly it's not where's
 

363
00:07:31,689 --> 00:07:35,159
like algorithms exactly it's not where's
algorithmic so okay you kind of

364
00:07:35,159 --> 00:07:35,169
algorithmic so okay you kind of
 

365
00:07:35,169 --> 00:07:36,600
algorithmic so okay you kind of
mentioned the Google self-driving car

366
00:07:36,600 --> 00:07:36,610
mentioned the Google self-driving car
 

367
00:07:36,610 --> 00:07:41,730
mentioned the Google self-driving car
but outside of that Oh what's like who

368
00:07:41,730 --> 00:07:41,740
but outside of that Oh what's like who
 

369
00:07:41,740 --> 00:07:44,429
but outside of that Oh what's like who
or what is your favorite robot real or

370
00:07:44,429 --> 00:07:44,439
or what is your favorite robot real or
 

371
00:07:44,439 --> 00:07:46,649
or what is your favorite robot real or
fictional that I captivated your

372
00:07:46,649 --> 00:07:46,659
fictional that I captivated your
 

373
00:07:46,659 --> 00:07:48,839
fictional that I captivated your
imagination throughout I mean I guess

374
00:07:48,839 --> 00:07:48,849
imagination throughout I mean I guess
 

375
00:07:48,849 --> 00:07:50,999
imagination throughout I mean I guess
you kind of alluded to the Google

376
00:07:50,999 --> 00:07:51,009
you kind of alluded to the Google
 

377
00:07:51,009 --> 00:07:52,859
you kind of alluded to the Google
self-driving the Firefly was a magical

378
00:07:52,859 --> 00:07:52,869
self-driving the Firefly was a magical
 

379
00:07:52,869 --> 00:07:56,010
self-driving the Firefly was a magical
moment but is there something else it

380
00:07:56,010 --> 00:07:56,020
moment but is there something else it
 

381
00:07:56,020 --> 00:07:57,329
moment but is there something else it
was I think there was the Lexus by the

good question I am okay my favorite
fictional robot is Wally and I love how

388
00:08:12,499 --> 00:08:12,509
fictional robot is Wally and I love how
 

389
00:08:12,509 --> 00:08:15,299
fictional robot is Wally and I love how
amazingly expressive it is some personal

390
00:08:15,299 --> 00:08:15,309
amazingly expressive it is some personal
 

391
00:08:15,309 --> 00:08:16,769
amazingly expressive it is some personal
things a little bit about expressive

392

things a little bit about expressive
 

393
00:08:16,779 --> 00:08:17,939
things a little bit about expressive
motion kinds of things you were staying

394
00:08:17,939 --> 00:08:17,949
motion kinds of things you were staying
 

395
00:08:17,949 --> 00:08:19,889
motion kinds of things you were staying
with you can do this and it's a head and

396
00:08:19,889 --> 00:08:19,899
with you can do this and it's a head and
 

397
00:08:19,899 --> 00:08:21,329
with you can do this and it's a head and
it's a manipulator and what does it all

398
00:08:21,329 --> 00:08:21,339
it's a manipulator and what does it all
 

399
00:08:21,339 --> 00:08:24,059
it's a manipulator and what does it all
mean I like to think about that stuff I

400
00:08:24,059 --> 00:08:24,069

that's it so you know it goes through

410
00:08:36,779 --> 00:08:36,789
that's it so you know it goes through
 

411
00:08:36,789 --> 00:08:38,550
that's it so you know it goes through
and then it's super cute

412
00:08:38,550 --> 00:08:38,560
and then it's super cute
 

413

it's yeah I think you know the way it
 

415
00:08:40,089 --> 00:08:41,969
it's yeah I think you know the way it
moves it's just so expressive the timing

416
00:08:41,969 --> 00:08:41,979
moves it's just so expressive the timing
 

417
00:08:41,979 --> 00:08:44,129
moves it's just so expressive the timing
of that motion what is doing with its

418
00:08:44,129 --> 00:08:44,139
of that motion what is doing with its
 

419
00:08:44,139 --> 00:08:45,750
of that motion what is doing with its
arms and what it's doing with these

420
00:08:45,750 --> 00:08:45,760
arms and what it's doing with these
 

421
00:08:45,760 --> 00:08:50,910
arms and what it's doing with these
lenses is amazing and so I've I've

422
00:08:50,910 --> 00:08:50,920
lenses is amazing and so I've I've
 

423
00:08:50,920 --> 00:08:53,430
lenses is amazing and so I've I've
really liked that from the start and

424
00:08:53,430 --> 00:08:53,440
really liked that from the start and
 

425
00:08:53,440 --> 00:08:56,069
really liked that from the start and
then on top of that sometimes I shared

426
00:08:56,069 --> 00:08:56,079
then on top of that sometimes I shared
 

427
00:08:56,079 --> 00:08:57,509
then on top of that sometimes I shared
this it's a personal story I share with

428
00:08:57,509 --> 00:08:57,519
this it's a personal story I share with
 

429
00:08:57,519 --> 00:08:59,670
this it's a personal story I share with
people or when I teach about AI or

430
00:08:59,670 --> 00:08:59,680
people or when I teach about AI or
 

431
00:08:59,680 --> 00:09:04,420
people or when I teach about AI or
whatnot my husband proposed to me

432
00:09:04,420 --> 00:09:04,430
whatnot my husband proposed to me
 

433
00:09:04,430 --> 00:09:09,430
whatnot my husband proposed to me
by building a Wally and he actuated it

434
00:09:09,430 --> 00:09:09,440
by building a Wally and he actuated it
 

435
00:09:09,440 --> 00:09:11,230
by building a Wally and he actuated it
so it's seven degrees of freedom

436
00:09:11,230 --> 00:09:11,240
so it's seven degrees of freedom
 

437
00:09:11,240 --> 00:09:15,250
so it's seven degrees of freedom
including the lens thing and it kind of

438
00:09:15,250 --> 00:09:15,260
including the lens thing and it kind of
 

439
00:09:15,260 --> 00:09:18,639
including the lens thing and it kind of
came in and it had the he made it have

440
00:09:18,639 --> 00:09:18,649
came in and it had the he made it have
 

441
00:09:18,649 --> 00:09:21,220
came in and it had the he made it have
like a you know the belly box opening

442
00:09:21,220 --> 00:09:21,230
like a you know the belly box opening
 

443
00:09:21,230 --> 00:09:24,010
like a you know the belly box opening
thing so it just did that and then it's

444
00:09:24,010 --> 00:09:24,020
thing so it just did that and then it's
 

445
00:09:24,020 --> 00:09:27,370
thing so it just did that and then it's
filled out this box made out of Legos

446
00:09:27,370 --> 00:09:27,380
filled out this box made out of Legos
 

447
00:09:27,380 --> 00:09:30,329
filled out this box made out of Legos
that open slowly and then BAM no yeah

448
00:09:30,329 --> 00:09:30,339
that open slowly and then BAM no yeah
 

449
00:09:30,339 --> 00:09:33,850
that open slowly and then BAM no yeah
yeah it was it was quite quite it's at a

450
00:09:33,850 --> 00:09:33,860
yeah it was it was quite quite it's at a
 

451
00:09:33,860 --> 00:09:35,920
yeah it was it was quite quite it's at a
bar it could be like the most impressive

452
00:09:35,920 --> 00:09:35,930
bar it could be like the most impressive
 

453
00:09:35,930 --> 00:09:37,030
bar it could be like the most impressive
thing I've ever heard

454
00:09:37,030 --> 00:09:37,040
thing I've ever heard
 

455
00:09:37,040 --> 00:09:40,420
thing I've ever heard
okay special connection to Wally long

456
00:09:40,420 --> 00:09:40,430
okay special connection to Wally long
 

457
00:09:40,430 --> 00:09:41,889
okay special connection to Wally long
story short I like Wally because I like

458
00:09:41,889 --> 00:09:41,899
story short I like Wally because I like
 

459
00:09:41,899 --> 00:09:44,310
story short I like Wally because I like
animation and I like robots and I like

460
00:09:44,310 --> 00:09:44,320
animation and I like robots and I like
 

461
00:09:44,320 --> 00:09:46,990
animation and I like robots and I like
you know the fact that this was I we

462
00:09:46,990 --> 00:09:47,000
you know the fact that this was I we
 

463
00:09:47,000 --> 00:09:49,570
you know the fact that this was I we
still have this robot to this day what

464
00:09:49,570 --> 00:09:49,580
still have this robot to this day what
 

465
00:09:49,580 --> 00:09:51,519
still have this robot to this day what
how hard is that problem do you think of

466
00:09:51,519 --> 00:09:51,529
how hard is that problem do you think of
 

467
00:09:51,529 --> 00:09:55,810
how hard is that problem do you think of
the expressivity of robots like the with

468
00:09:55,810 --> 00:09:55,820
the expressivity of robots like the with
 

469
00:09:55,820 --> 00:09:58,090
the expressivity of robots like the with
the Boston Dynamics I never talked to

470
00:09:58,090 --> 00:09:58,100
the Boston Dynamics I never talked to
 

471
00:09:58,100 --> 00:09:59,920
the Boston Dynamics I never talked to
those folks about this particular

472
00:09:59,920 --> 00:09:59,930
those folks about this particular
 

473
00:09:59,930 --> 00:10:02,470
those folks about this particular
element I've talked to him a lot but it

474
00:10:02,470 --> 00:10:02,480
element I've talked to him a lot but it
 

475
00:10:02,480 --> 00:10:04,389
element I've talked to him a lot but it
seems to be like almost an accidental

00:13:16,680 --> 00:13:19,220
motion your actions end up sort of
influencing the observers kind of

634
00:13:19,220 --> 00:13:19,230
influencing the observers kind of
 

635
00:13:19,230 --> 00:13:22,400
influencing the observers kind of
perception of you and it's very it's

636
00:13:22,400 --> 00:13:22,410
perception of you and it's very it's
 

637
00:13:22,410 --> 00:13:25,190
perception of you and it's very it's
very hard to write math about that right

638
00:13:25,190 --> 00:13:25,200
very hard to write math about that right
 

639
00:13:25,200 --> 00:13:27,020
very hard to write math about that right
so when you start to think about

640
00:13:27,020 --> 00:13:27,030
so when you start to think about
 

641
00:13:27,030 --> 00:13:28,850
so when you start to think about
incorporating the human into the state

642
00:13:28,850 --> 00:13:28,860
incorporating the human into the state
 

643
00:13:28,860 --> 00:13:31,040

apologize for the philosophical question

646
00:13:33,540 --> 00:13:33,550
apologize for the philosophical question
 

647
00:13:33,550 --> 00:13:35,910
apologize for the philosophical question
but how complicated are human beings do

648
00:13:35,910 --> 00:13:35,920
but how complicated are human beings do
 

649
00:13:35,920 --> 00:13:38,190
but how complicated are human beings do
you think like can they be reduced to

650
00:13:38,190 --> 00:13:38,200
you think like can they be reduced to
 

651
00:13:38,200 --> 00:13:43,020
you think like can they be reduced to
two kind of almost like an object that

652
00:13:43,020 --> 00:13:43,030
two kind of almost like an object that
 

653
00:13:43,030 --> 00:13:45,780
two kind of almost like an object that
moves and maybe has some basic intents

654
00:13:45,780 --> 00:13:45,790
moves and maybe has some basic intents
 

655
00:13:45,790 --> 00:13:48,150
moves and maybe has some basic intents
or is there something do we have to

656
00:13:48,150 --> 00:13:48,160
or is there something do we have to
 

657
00:13:48,160 --> 00:13:51,390
or is there something do we have to
model things like mood and general

658
00:13:51,390 --> 00:13:51,400
model things like mood and general
 

659
00:13:51,400 --> 00:13:53,430
model things like mood and general
aggressiveness and time I mean all these

660
00:13:53,430 --> 00:13:53,440
aggressiveness and time I mean all these
 

661
00:13:53,440 --> 00:13:55,500
aggressiveness and time I mean all these
kinds of human qualities or like game

662
00:13:55,500 --> 00:13:55,510
kinds of human qualities or like game
 

663
00:13:55,510 --> 00:13:58,020
kinds of human qualities or like game
theoretic qualities like what's your

664
00:13:58,020 --> 00:13:58,030
theoretic qualities like what's your
 

665
00:13:58,030 --> 00:14:00,810
theoretic qualities like what's your
sense how complicated it is how hard is

666
00:14:00,810 --> 00:14:00,820
sense how complicated it is how hard is
 

667
00:14:00,820 --> 00:14:02,480

the problem of human robot interaction

668
00:14:02,480 --> 00:14:02,490
the problem of human robot interaction
 

669
00:14:02,490 --> 00:14:05,670
the problem of human robot interaction
yeah should we talk about what the

670
00:14:05,670 --> 00:14:05,680
yeah should we talk about what the
 

671
00:14:05,680 --> 00:14:08,310
yeah should we talk about what the
problem of human robot is yeah this is

672
00:14:08,310 --> 00:14:08,320
problem of human robot is yeah this is
 

673
00:14:08,320 --> 00:14:12,620
problem of human robot is yeah this is
what I mean talk about how that yeah so

674
00:14:12,620 --> 00:14:12,630
what I mean talk about how that yeah so
 

675
00:14:12,630 --> 00:14:15,120
what I mean talk about how that yeah so
and by the way I'm gonna talk about this

676
00:14:15,120 --> 00:14:15,130
and by the way I'm gonna talk about this
 

677
00:14:15,130 --> 00:14:17,580
and by the way I'm gonna talk about this
very particular view of human robot

678
00:14:17,580 --> 00:14:17,590
very particular view of human robot
 

679
00:14:17,590 --> 00:14:19,920
very particular view of human robot
interaction right which is not so much

680
00:14:19,920 --> 00:14:19,930
interaction right which is not so much
 

681
00:14:19,930 --> 00:14:23,280
interaction right which is not so much
on the social side or on the side of how

682
00:14:23,280 --> 00:14:23,290
on the social side or on the side of how
 

683
00:14:23,290 --> 00:14:24,750
on the social side or on the side of how
do you have a good conversation with the

684
00:14:24,750 --> 00:14:24,760
do you have a good conversation with the
 

685
00:14:24,760 --> 00:14:26,250
do you have a good conversation with the
robot what should the robots appearance

686
00:14:26,250 --> 00:14:26,260
robot what should the robots appearance
 

687
00:14:26,260 --> 00:14:27,960
robot what should the robots appearance
be throws out that if you make robots

688
00:14:27,960 --> 00:14:27,970
be throws out that if you make robots
 

689
00:14:27,970 --> 00:14:29,700
be throws out that if you make robots
taller versus shorter this has an effect

690
00:14:29,700 --> 00:14:29,710
taller versus shorter this has an effect
 

691
00:14:29,710 --> 00:14:32,700
taller versus shorter this has an effect
on how people act with them so I'm not

692
00:14:32,700 --> 00:14:32,710
on how people act with them so I'm not
 

693
00:14:32,710 --> 00:14:34,860
on how people act with them so I'm not
I'm not talking about that but I'm

694
00:14:34,860 --> 00:14:34,870
I'm not talking about that but I'm
 

695
00:14:34,870 --> 00:14:35,910
I'm not talking about that but I'm
talking about this very kind of narrow

696
00:14:35,910 --> 00:14:35,920
talking about this very kind of narrow
 

697
00:14:35,920 --> 00:14:38,070
talking about this very kind of narrow
thing which is you take if you want to

698
00:14:38,070 --> 00:14:38,080
thing which is you take if you want to
 

699
00:14:38,080 --> 00:14:41,610
thing which is you take if you want to
take a task that a robot can do in

700
00:14:41,610 --> 00:14:41,620
take a task that a robot can do in
 

701
00:14:41,620 --> 00:14:44,880
take a task that a robot can do in
isolation in a lab out there in the

702
00:14:44,880 --> 00:14:44,890
isolation in a lab out there in the
 

703
00:14:44,890 --> 00:14:47,130
isolation in a lab out there in the
world but in isolation and now you're

704
00:14:47,130 --> 00:14:47,140
world but in isolation and now you're
 

705
00:14:47,140 --> 00:14:49,200
world but in isolation and now you're
asking what does it mean for the robot

706
00:14:49,200 --> 00:14:49,210
asking what does it mean for the robot
 

707
00:14:49,210 --> 00:14:52,290
asking what does it mean for the robot
to be able to do this task for

708
00:14:52,290 --> 00:14:52,300
to be able to do this task for
 

709
00:14:52,300 --> 00:14:54,180
to be able to do this task for
presumably what it's actually angola's

710
00:14:54,180 --> 00:14:54,190
presumably what it's actually angola's
 

711
00:14:54,190 --> 00:14:57,750
presumably what it's actually angola's
which is to help some person that ends

00:14:57,750 --> 00:14:57,760
which is to help some person that ends
 

713
00:14:57,760 --> 00:15:03,030
which is to help some person that ends
up changing the problem in two ways the

714
00:15:03,030 --> 00:15:03,040
up changing the problem in two ways the
 

715
00:15:03,040 --> 00:15:04,440
up changing the problem in two ways the
first way to changes the problem is that

716
00:15:04,440 --> 00:15:04,450
first way to changes the problem is that
 

717
00:15:04,450 --> 00:15:07,020
first way to changes the problem is that
the robot is no longer the single agent

718
00:15:07,020 --> 00:15:07,030
the robot is no longer the single agent
 

719
00:15:07,030 --> 00:15:10,320
the robot is no longer the single agent
acting there you have humans who also

720
00:15:10,320 --> 00:15:10,330
acting there you have humans who also
 

721
00:15:10,330 --> 00:15:12,090
acting there you have humans who also
take actions in that same space you know

722
00:15:12,090 --> 00:15:12,100
take actions in that same space you know

00:15:19,140 --> 00:15:19,150
people in that office if I send the
 

729
00:15:19,150 --> 00:15:21,000
people in that office if I send the
robot to over there in the cafeteria to

730
00:15:21,000 --> 00:15:21,010
robot to over there in the cafeteria to
 

731
00:15:21,010 --> 00:15:21,900
robot to over there in the cafeteria to
get me a coffee

732
00:15:21,900 --> 00:15:21,910
get me a coffee
 

733
00:15:21,910 --> 00:15:23,730
get me a coffee
then there's from other people reaching

00:15:23,740 --> 00:15:25,770
then there's from other people reaching

of the actions that the robot is taking
 

741
00:15:30,190 --> 00:15:32,040
of the actions that the robot is taking

then you have these people who are also
 

743
00:15:32,050 --> 00:15:34,680
then you have these people who are also

that sort of the problem number one and
 

757
00:15:49,900 --> 00:15:52,880
that sort of the problem number one and
then there's problem number two which is

then there's problem number two which is
goes back to this notion of I if I'm a

760
00:15:56,910 --> 00:15:56,920
goes back to this notion of I if I'm a
 

761
00:15:56,920 --> 00:16:00,300
goes back to this notion of I if I'm a
programmer I can specify some objective

762
00:16:00,300 --> 00:16:00,310
programmer I can specify some objective
 

763
00:16:00,310 --> 00:16:02,070

764
00:16:02,070 --> 00:16:02,080
for the robot to go off and optimize you
 

765
00:16:02,080 --> 00:16:05,160
for the robot to go off and optimize you
can specify the task but if I put the

766
00:16:05,160 --> 00:16:05,170
can specify the task but if I put the
 

767
00:16:05,170 --> 00:16:09,480
can specify the task but if I put the
robot in your home presumably you might

768
00:16:09,480 --> 00:16:09,490
robot in your home presumably you might
 

769
00:16:09,490 --> 00:16:11,880
robot in your home presumably you might
have your own opinions about well okay I

770
00:16:11,880 --> 00:16:11,890
have your own opinions about well okay I
 

771
00:16:11,890 --> 00:16:13,680
have your own opinions about well okay I
want my house clean but how do I want it

772
00:16:13,680 --> 00:16:13,690
want my house clean but how do I want it
 

773
00:16:13,690 --> 00:16:15,570
want my house clean but how do I want it
clean then how should robot how close to

774
00:16:15,570 --> 00:16:15,580
clean then how should robot how close to
 

775
00:16:15,580 --> 00:16:17,580
clean then how should robot how close to
me it should come and all of that and so

776
00:16:17,580 --> 00:16:17,590
me it should come and all of that and so
 

777
00:16:17,590 --> 00:16:19,350
me it should come and all of that and so
I think those are the two differences

778
00:16:19,350 --> 00:16:19,360
I think those are the two differences
 

779
00:16:19,360 --> 00:16:21,780
I think those are the two differences
that you have your acting around people

780
00:16:21,780 --> 00:16:21,790
that you have your acting around people
 

781
00:16:21,790 --> 00:16:25,500
that you have your acting around people
and you what you should be optimizing

782
00:16:25,500 --> 00:16:25,510
and you what you should be optimizing
 

783
00:16:25,510 --> 00:16:27,570
and you what you should be optimizing
for should satisfy the preferences of

784
00:16:27,570 --> 00:16:27,580
for should satisfy the preferences of
 

785
00:16:27,580 --> 00:16:29,850
for should satisfy the preferences of
that end user not of your programmer who

786
00:16:29,850 --> 00:16:29,860
that end user not of your programmer who
 

787
00:16:29,860 --> 00:16:32,490
that end user not of your programmer who
programmed you yeah and the Preferences

788
00:16:32,490 --> 00:16:32,500
programmed you yeah and the Preferences
 

789
00:16:32,500 --> 00:16:34,800
programmed you yeah and the Preferences
thing is tricky so figuring out those

790
00:16:34,800 --> 00:16:34,810
thing is tricky so figuring out those
 

791
00:16:34,810 --> 00:16:36,710
thing is tricky so figuring out those
preferences be able to interactively

792
00:16:36,710 --> 00:16:36,720
preferences be able to interactively
 

793
00:16:36,720 --> 00:16:39,600
preferences be able to interactively
adjust to understand what the human is

794
00:16:39,600 --> 00:16:39,610
adjust to understand what the human is
 

795
00:16:39,610 --> 00:16:41,730
adjust to understand what the human is
so really boys ought to be understand

796
00:16:41,730 --> 00:16:41,740
so really boys ought to be understand
 

797
00:16:41,740 --> 00:16:43,740
so really boys ought to be understand
the humans in order to interact with

798
00:16:43,740 --> 00:16:43,750
the humans in order to interact with
 

799
00:16:43,750 --> 00:16:47,220
the humans in order to interact with
them in order to please them right so

800
00:16:47,220 --> 00:16:47,230
them in order to please them right so
 

801
00:16:47,230 --> 00:16:48,900
them in order to please them right so
why is this hard what yeah why is

802
00:16:48,900 --> 00:16:48,910
why is this hard what yeah why is
 

803
00:16:48,910 --> 00:16:54,350
why is this hard what yeah why is
understanding humans hard so I think

804
00:16:54,350 --> 00:16:54,360
understanding humans hard so I think
 

805
00:16:54,360 --> 00:16:57,330
understanding humans hard so I think
there's two tasks about understanding

806
00:16:57,330 --> 00:16:57,340
there's two tasks about understanding
 

807
00:16:57,340 --> 00:16:59,460
there's two tasks about understanding
humans that in my mind are very very

808
00:16:59,460 --> 00:16:59,470
humans that in my mind are very very
 

809
00:16:59,470 --> 00:17:01,110
humans that in my mind are very very
similar but not everyone agrees so

810
00:17:01,110 --> 00:17:01,120
similar but not everyone agrees so
 

811
00:17:01,120 --> 00:17:03,380
similar but not everyone agrees so
there's the task of being able to just

812
00:17:03,380 --> 00:17:03,390
there's the task of being able to just
 

813
00:17:03,390 --> 00:17:05,910
there's the task of being able to just
anticipate what people will do we all

814
00:17:05,910 --> 00:17:05,920
anticipate what people will do we all
 

815
00:17:05,920 --> 00:17:07,650
anticipate what people will do we all
know that cards need to do this right we

816
00:17:07,650 --> 00:17:07,660
know that cards need to do this right we
 

817
00:17:07,660 --> 00:17:09,180
know that cards need to do this right we
all know that well if I navigate around

818
00:17:09,180 --> 00:17:09,190
all know that well if I navigate around
 

819
00:17:09,190 --> 00:17:11,730
all know that well if I navigate around
some people the robot has to get some

820
00:17:11,730 --> 00:17:11,740
some people the robot has to get some
 

821
00:17:11,740 --> 00:17:13,950
some people the robot has to get some
notion of ok where where is this person

822
00:17:13,950 --> 00:17:13,960
notion of ok where where is this person
 

823
00:17:13,960 --> 00:17:16,110
notion of ok where where is this person
gonna be so that's kind of the

824
00:17:16,110 --> 00:17:16,120
gonna be so that's kind of the
 

825
00:17:16,120 --> 00:17:18,300
gonna be so that's kind of the
prediction side and then there's what

826
00:17:18,300 --> 00:17:18,310
prediction side and then there's what
 

827
00:17:18,310 --> 00:17:19,830
prediction side and then there's what
what you are saying satisfying the

828
00:17:19,830 --> 00:17:19,840
what you are saying satisfying the
 

829
00:17:19,840 --> 00:17:21,810
what you are saying satisfying the
preferences right so adapting to the

830
00:17:21,810 --> 00:17:21,820
preferences right so adapting to the
 

831
00:17:21,820 --> 00:17:23,310
preferences right so adapting to the
person's preference is knowing what to

832
00:17:23,310 --> 00:17:23,320
person's preference is knowing what to
 

833
00:17:23,320 --> 00:17:25,050
person's preference is knowing what to
optimize for which is more this

834
00:17:25,050 --> 00:17:25,060
optimize for which is more this
 

835
00:17:25,060 --> 00:17:26,970
optimize for which is more this
inference side this what is what does

836
00:17:26,970 --> 00:17:26,980
inference side this what is what does
 

837
00:17:26,980 --> 00:17:29,610
inference side this what is what does
this person want what is their intent

838
00:17:29,610 --> 00:17:29,620
this person want what is their intent
 

839
00:17:29,620 --> 00:17:32,790
this person want what is their intent
what are their preferences and to me

840
00:17:32,790 --> 00:17:32,800
what are their preferences and to me
 

841
00:17:32,800 --> 00:17:35,520
what are their preferences and to me
those kind of go together because I

842
00:17:35,520 --> 00:17:35,530
those kind of go together because I
 

843
00:17:35,530 --> 00:17:39,780
those kind of go together because I
think that in if you at very least if

844
00:17:39,780 --> 00:17:39,790
think that in if you at very least if
 

845
00:17:39,790 --> 00:17:42,090
think that in if you at very least if
you can understand if you look at human

846
00:17:42,090 --> 00:17:42,100
you can understand if you look at human
 

847
00:17:42,100 --> 00:17:43,920
you can understand if you look at human
behavior and understand what it is that

848
00:17:43,920 --> 00:17:43,930
behavior and understand what it is that
 

849
00:17:43,930 --> 00:17:46,740
behavior and understand what it is that
they want then that's sort of the key

850
00:17:46,740 --> 00:17:46,750
they want then that's sort of the key
 

851
00:17:46,750 --> 00:17:49,050
they want then that's sort of the key
enabler to being able to anticipate what

852
00:17:49,050 --> 00:17:49,060
enabler to being able to anticipate what
 

853
00:17:49,060 --> 00:17:51,030
enabler to being able to anticipate what
they'll do in the future because I think

854
00:17:51,030 --> 00:17:51,040
they'll do in the future because I think
 

855
00:17:51,040 --> 00:17:53,700
they'll do in the future because I think
that you know we're not arbitrary we

856
00:17:53,700 --> 00:17:53,710
that you know we're not arbitrary we
 

857
00:17:53,710 --> 00:17:55,650
that you know we're not arbitrary we
make these decisions that we make we act

858
00:17:55,650 --> 00:17:55,660
make these decisions that we make we act
 

859
00:17:55,660 --> 00:17:57,630
make these decisions that we make we act
in the way we do because we're trying to

860
00:17:57,630 --> 00:17:57,640
in the way we do because we're trying to
 

861
00:17:57,640 --> 00:17:58,200
in the way we do because we're trying to
achieve

862
00:17:58,200 --> 00:17:58,210
achieve
 

863
00:17:58,210 --> 00:18:00,000
achieve
things and so I think that's the

864
00:18:00,000 --> 00:18:00,010
things and so I think that's the
 

865
00:18:00,010 --> 00:18:02,580
things and so I think that's the
relationship between them now how

866
00:18:02,580 --> 00:18:02,590
relationship between them now how
 

867
00:18:02,590 --> 00:18:04,710
relationship between them now how
complicated do these models need to be

868
00:18:04,710 --> 00:18:04,720
complicated do these models need to be
 

869
00:18:04,720 --> 00:18:08,460
complicated do these models need to be
in order to be able to understand what

870
00:18:08,460 --> 00:18:08,470
in order to be able to understand what
 

871
00:18:08,470 --> 00:18:13,890
in order to be able to understand what
people want so we've gotten a long way

872
00:18:13,890 --> 00:18:13,900
people want so we've gotten a long way
 

873
00:18:13,900 --> 00:18:16,200
people want so we've gotten a long way
in robotics with something called

874
00:18:16,200 --> 00:18:16,210
in robotics with something called
 

875
00:18:16,210 --> 00:18:17,730
in robotics with something called
inverse reinforcement learning which is

876
00:18:17,730 --> 00:18:17,740
inverse reinforcement learning which is
 

877
00:18:17,740 --> 00:18:19,950
inverse reinforcement learning which is
the notion of someone acts demonstrates

878
00:18:19,950 --> 00:18:19,960
the notion of someone acts demonstrates
 

879
00:18:19,960 --> 00:18:22,230
the notion of someone acts demonstrates
what how they want this thing done what

880
00:18:22,230 --> 00:18:22,240
what how they want this thing done what
 

881
00:18:22,240 --> 00:18:24,270
what how they want this thing done what
isn't inverse reinforcement learning you

882
00:18:24,270 --> 00:18:24,280
isn't inverse reinforcement learning you
 

883
00:18:24,280 --> 00:18:27,030
isn't inverse reinforcement learning you
said it right so it's it's the problem

884
00:18:27,030 --> 00:18:27,040
said it right so it's it's the problem
 

885
00:18:27,040 --> 00:18:31,860
said it right so it's it's the problem
of take human behavior and infer reward

886
00:18:31,860 --> 00:18:31,870
of take human behavior and infer reward
 

887
00:18:31,870 --> 00:18:34,140
of take human behavior and infer reward
function from this figure out what it is

888
00:18:34,140 --> 00:18:34,150
function from this figure out what it is
 

889
00:18:34,150 --> 00:18:36,000
function from this figure out what it is
that that behavior is optimal with

890
00:18:36,000 --> 00:18:36,010
that that behavior is optimal with
 

891
00:18:36,010 --> 00:18:38,640
that that behavior is optimal with
respect to and it's a great way to think

892
00:18:38,640 --> 00:18:38,650
respect to and it's a great way to think
 

893
00:18:38,650 --> 00:18:40,440
respect to and it's a great way to think
about learning human preferences in the

894
00:18:40,440 --> 00:18:40,450
about learning human preferences in the
 

895
00:18:40,450 --> 00:18:44,340
about learning human preferences in the
sense of you know you have a car and the

896
00:18:44,340 --> 00:18:44,350
sense of you know you have a car and the
 

897
00:18:44,350 --> 00:18:46,050
sense of you know you have a car and the
person can drive it and then you can say

898
00:18:46,050 --> 00:18:46,060
person can drive it and then you can say
 

899
00:18:46,060 --> 00:18:48,180
person can drive it and then you can say
well okay I can actually learn what the

900
00:18:48,180 --> 00:18:48,190
well okay I can actually learn what the
 

901
00:18:48,190 --> 00:18:52,350
well okay I can actually learn what the
person is optimizing for I can learn

902
00:18:52,350 --> 00:18:52,360
person is optimizing for I can learn
 

903
00:18:52,360 --> 00:18:54,720
person is optimizing for I can learn
their driving style or you can you can

904
00:18:54,720 --> 00:18:54,730
their driving style or you can you can
 

905
00:18:54,730 --> 00:18:56,130
their driving style or you can you can
have people demonstrate how they want

906
00:18:56,130 --> 00:18:56,140
have people demonstrate how they want
 

907
00:18:56,140 --> 00:18:58,200
have people demonstrate how they want
the house clean and then you can say

908
00:18:58,200 --> 00:18:58,210
the house clean and then you can say
 

909
00:18:58,210 --> 00:19:00,450
the house clean and then you can say
okay this is this is I mean I'm getting

910
00:19:00,450 --> 00:19:00,460
okay this is this is I mean I'm getting
 

911
00:19:00,460 --> 00:19:02,610
okay this is this is I mean I'm getting
the trade-offs that they're that they're

912
00:19:02,610 --> 00:19:02,620
the trade-offs that they're that they're
 

913
00:19:02,620 --> 00:19:04,140
the trade-offs that they're that they're
making I'm getting the Preferences that

914
00:19:04,140 --> 00:19:04,150
making I'm getting the Preferences that
 

915
00:19:04,150 --> 00:19:06,810
making I'm getting the Preferences that
they want out of this and so we've been

916
00:19:06,810 --> 00:19:06,820
they want out of this and so we've been
 

917
00:19:06,820 --> 00:19:09,480
they want out of this and so we've been
successful in robotics somewhat with

918
00:19:09,480 --> 00:19:09,490
successful in robotics somewhat with
 

919
00:19:09,490 --> 00:19:12,390
successful in robotics somewhat with
this and it's a it's based on a very

920
00:19:12,390 --> 00:19:12,400
this and it's a it's based on a very
 

921
00:19:12,400 --> 00:19:15,210
this and it's a it's based on a very
simple model of human behavior which is

922
00:19:15,210 --> 00:19:15,220
simple model of human behavior which is
 

923
00:19:15,220 --> 00:19:17,250
simple model of human behavior which is
remarkably simple which is that human

924
00:19:17,250 --> 00:19:17,260
remarkably simple which is that human
 

925
00:19:17,260 --> 00:19:19,320
remarkably simple which is that human
behavior is optimal with respect to

926
00:19:19,320 --> 00:19:19,330
behavior is optimal with respect to
 

927
00:19:19,330 --> 00:19:21,870
behavior is optimal with respect to
whatever it is that people want right so

928
00:19:21,870 --> 00:19:21,880
whatever it is that people want right so
 

929
00:19:21,880 --> 00:19:23,610
whatever it is that people want right so
you make that assumption and now you can

930
00:19:23,610 --> 00:19:23,620
you make that assumption and now you can
 

931
00:19:23,620 --> 00:19:24,840
you make that assumption and now you can
kind of inverse through that's why it's

932
00:19:24,840 --> 00:19:24,850
kind of inverse through that's why it's
 

933
00:19:24,850 --> 00:19:26,850
kind of inverse through that's why it's
called inverse well really optimal

934
00:19:26,850 --> 00:19:26,860
called inverse well really optimal
 

935
00:19:26,860 --> 00:19:28,740
called inverse well really optimal
control but but also inverse

936
00:19:28,740 --> 00:19:28,750
control but but also inverse
 

937
00:19:28,750 --> 00:19:31,380
control but but also inverse
reinforcement learning so this is based

938
00:19:31,380 --> 00:19:31,390
reinforcement learning so this is based
 

939
00:19:31,390 --> 00:19:36,240
reinforcement learning so this is based
on utility maximization in economics

940
00:19:36,240 --> 00:19:36,250
on utility maximization in economics
 

941
00:19:36,250 --> 00:19:38,700
on utility maximization in economics

making choices by maximizing utility go

946
00:19:44,790 --> 00:19:44,800
making choices by maximizing utility go
 

947
00:19:44,800 --> 00:19:50,520
making choices by maximizing utility go
and then in the late 50s we had loose

948
00:19:50,520 --> 00:19:50,530
and then in the late 50s we had loose

they just crash it left and right okay
so this is the kind of toss for imagine

1018
00:21:14,820 --> 00:21:14,830
so this is the kind of toss for imagine

00:21:25,800 --> 00:21:29,790
you're trying to do and help you do it
it's really hard to do that for say

00:21:29,790 --> 00:21:29,800
it's really hard to do that for say

lunar lander because people are all over
 

1033
00:21:32,560 --> 00:21:34,470
lunar lander because people are all over
the place and so they seem much more

1034
00:21:34,470 --> 00:21:34,480
the place and so they seem much more
 

1035
00:21:34,480 --> 00:21:37,710
the place and so they seem much more
noisy than really irrational that's an

00:23:00,520 --> 00:23:00,530
understand something about you but
 

1105
00:23:00,530 --> 00:23:03,040
understand something about you but
listening to you talk it would be harder

1106
00:23:03,040 --> 00:23:03,050
listening to you talk it would be harder
 

1107
00:23:03,050 --> 00:23:06,490
listening to you talk it would be harder
than if I got to say something and ask

1108
00:23:06,490 --> 00:23:06,500
than if I got to say something and ask
 

1109
00:23:06,500 --> 00:23:09,940
than if I got to say something and ask
you and interact and control okay can

1110
00:23:09,940 --> 00:23:09,950
you and interact and control okay can
 

1111
00:23:09,950 --> 00:23:12,580
you and interact and control okay can
you can the robot help its understanding

1112
00:23:12,580 --> 00:23:12,590
you can the robot help its understanding
 

1113
00:23:12,590 --> 00:23:15,430
you can the robot help its understanding
of the human by inflowing it influencing

1114
00:23:15,430 --> 00:23:15,440
of the human by inflowing it influencing
 

1115
00:23:15,440 --> 00:23:18,730
of the human by inflowing it influencing
the behavior by actually acting yeah

1116
00:23:18,730 --> 00:23:18,740
the behavior by actually acting yeah
 

1117
00:23:18,740 --> 00:23:21,880
the behavior by actually acting yeah
absolutely so one of the things that's

1118
00:23:21,880 --> 00:23:21,890
absolutely so one of the things that's
 

1119
00:23:21,890 --> 00:23:25,420
absolutely so one of the things that's
been exciting to me lately is this

1120
00:23:25,420 --> 00:23:25,430
been exciting to me lately is this
 

1121
00:23:25,430 --> 00:23:29,140
been exciting to me lately is this
notion that when you tried to that that

1122
00:23:29,140 --> 00:23:29,150
notion that when you tried to that that
 

1123
00:23:29,150 --> 00:23:30,910
notion that when you tried to that that
that when you try to think of the

1124
00:23:30,910 --> 00:23:30,920
that when you try to think of the
 

1125
00:23:30,920 --> 00:23:32,770
that when you try to think of the
robotics problem as okay I have a robot

1126
00:23:32,770 --> 00:23:32,780
robotics problem as okay I have a robot
 

1127
00:23:32,780 --> 00:23:35,140
robotics problem as okay I have a robot
and it needs to optimize for whatever it

1128
00:23:35,140 --> 00:23:35,150
and it needs to optimize for whatever it
 

1129
00:23:35,150 --> 00:23:37,300
and it needs to optimize for whatever it
is that a person wants it to optimize as

1130
00:23:37,300 --> 00:23:37,310
is that a person wants it to optimize as
 

1131
00:23:37,310 --> 00:23:39,900
is that a person wants it to optimize as
opposed to maybe what a programmer said

1132
00:23:39,900 --> 00:23:39,910
opposed to maybe what a programmer said
 

1133
00:23:39,910 --> 00:23:44,230
opposed to maybe what a programmer said
that problem we think of as a human

1134
00:23:44,230 --> 00:23:44,240
that problem we think of as a human
 

1135
00:23:44,240 --> 00:23:46,390
that problem we think of as a human
robot collaboration problem in which

1136
00:23:46,390 --> 00:23:46,400
robot collaboration problem in which
 

1137
00:23:46,400 --> 00:23:49,720
robot collaboration problem in which
both agents get to act in which the

1138
00:23:49,720 --> 00:23:49,730
both agents get to act in which the
 

1139
00:23:49,730 --> 00:23:52,510
both agents get to act in which the
robot knows less than the human because

1140
00:23:52,510 --> 00:23:52,520
robot knows less than the human because
 

1141
00:23:52,520 --> 00:23:54,760
robot knows less than the human because
the human actually has access to and you

1142
00:23:54,760 --> 00:23:54,770
the human actually has access to and you
 

1143
00:23:54,770 --> 00:23:56,410
the human actually has access to and you
know at least implicitly to what it is

1144
00:23:56,410 --> 00:23:56,420
know at least implicitly to what it is
 

1145
00:23:56,420 --> 00:23:58,000
know at least implicitly to what it is
that they want they can't write it down

1146
00:23:58,000 --> 00:23:58,010
that they want they can't write it down
 

1147
00:23:58,010 --> 00:24:00,700
that they want they can't write it down
but they can they can talk about it they

1148
00:24:00,700 --> 00:24:00,710
but they can they can talk about it they
 

1149
00:24:00,710 --> 00:24:02,560
but they can they can talk about it they
can give all sorts of signals they can

1150
00:24:02,560 --> 00:24:02,570
can give all sorts of signals they can
 

1151
00:24:02,570 --> 00:24:04,990
can give all sorts of signals they can
demonstrate and and but the robot

1152
00:24:04,990 --> 00:24:05,000
demonstrate and and but the robot
 

1153
00:24:05,000 --> 00:24:07,240
demonstrate and and but the robot
doesn't need to sit there and passively

1154
00:24:07,240 --> 00:24:07,250
doesn't need to sit there and passively
 

1155
00:24:07,250 --> 00:24:09,280
doesn't need to sit there and passively
observe human behavior and try to make

1156
00:24:09,280 --> 00:24:09,290
observe human behavior and try to make
 

1157
00:24:09,290 --> 00:24:12,310
observe human behavior and try to make
sense of it the robot can act too and so

1158
00:24:12,310 --> 00:24:12,320
sense of it the robot can act too and so
 

1159
00:24:12,320 --> 00:24:14,050
sense of it the robot can act too and so
there's these information gathering

1160
00:24:14,050 --> 00:24:14,060
there's these information gathering
 

1161
00:24:14,060 --> 00:24:17,620
there's these information gathering
actions that the robot can take to sort

1162
00:24:17,620 --> 00:24:17,630
actions that the robot can take to sort
 

1163
00:24:17,630 --> 00:24:19,750
actions that the robot can take to sort
of solicit responses that are actually

1164
00:24:19,750 --> 00:24:19,760
of solicit responses that are actually
 

1165
00:24:19,760 --> 00:24:22,300
of solicit responses that are actually
informative so for instance this is not

1166
00:24:22,300 --> 00:24:22,310
informative so for instance this is not
 

1167
00:24:22,310 --> 00:24:24,100
informative so for instance this is not
for the purpose of assisting people but

1168
00:24:24,100 --> 00:24:24,110
for the purpose of assisting people but
 

1169
00:24:24,110 --> 00:24:25,690
for the purpose of assisting people but
with kind of back to coordinating with

1170
00:24:25,690 --> 00:24:25,700
with kind of back to coordinating with
 

1171
00:24:25,700 --> 00:24:26,980
with kind of back to coordinating with
people in cars and all of that

1172
00:24:26,980 --> 00:24:26,990
people in cars and all of that
 

1173
00:24:26,990 --> 00:24:32,260
people in cars and all of that
one thing that dorsa did was so we were

1174
00:24:32,260 --> 00:24:32,270
one thing that dorsa did was so we were
 

1175
00:24:32,270 --> 00:24:33,940
one thing that dorsa did was so we were
looking at cars being able to navigate

1176
00:24:33,940 --> 00:24:33,950
looking at cars being able to navigate
 

1177
00:24:33,950 --> 00:24:38,830
looking at cars being able to navigate
around people and you might not know

1178
00:24:38,830 --> 00:24:38,840
around people and you might not know
 

1179
00:24:38,840 --> 00:24:40,660
around people and you might not know
exactly the driving style of a

1180
00:24:40,660 --> 00:24:40,670
exactly the driving style of a
 

1181
00:24:40,670 --> 00:24:42,610
exactly the driving style of a
particular individual that's next to you

1182
00:24:42,610 --> 00:24:42,620
particular individual that's next to you
 

1183
00:24:42,620 --> 00:24:44,800
particular individual that's next to you
but you want to change lanes in front of

1184
00:24:44,800 --> 00:24:44,810
but you want to change lanes in front of
 

1185
00:24:44,810 --> 00:24:47,710
but you want to change lanes in front of
them navigating around other humans

1186
00:24:47,710 --> 00:24:47,720
them navigating around other humans
 

1187
00:24:47,720 --> 00:24:50,290
them navigating around other humans
inside cars yeah good good clarification

1188
00:24:50,290 --> 00:24:50,300
inside cars yeah good good clarification
 

1189
00:24:50,300 --> 00:24:53,920
inside cars yeah good good clarification
question so you have an autonomous car

1190
00:24:53,920 --> 00:24:53,930
question so you have an autonomous car
 

1191
00:24:53,930 --> 00:24:56,260
question so you have an autonomous car
and it's trying to navigate the road

1192
00:24:56,260 --> 00:24:56,270
and it's trying to navigate the road
 

1193
00:24:56,270 --> 00:24:59,200
and it's trying to navigate the road
around human driven vehicles similar

1194
00:24:59,200 --> 00:24:59,210
around human driven vehicles similar
 

1195
00:24:59,210 --> 00:25:01,240
around human driven vehicles similar
things ideas applied to pedestrians as

1196
00:25:01,240 --> 00:25:01,250
things ideas applied to pedestrians as
 

1197
00:25:01,250 --> 00:25:02,710
things ideas applied to pedestrians as
well but let's just take human driven

1198
00:25:02,710 --> 00:25:02,720
well but let's just take human driven
 

1199
00:25:02,720 --> 00:25:04,810
well but let's just take human driven
vehicles so now you're trying to change

1200
00:25:04,810 --> 00:25:04,820
vehicles so now you're trying to change
 

1201
00:25:04,820 --> 00:25:08,290
vehicles so now you're trying to change
a lane well you could be trying to infer

1202
00:25:08,290 --> 00:25:08,300
a lane well you could be trying to infer
 

1203
00:25:08,300 --> 00:25:11,410
a lane well you could be trying to infer
the driving style of this person next to

1204
00:25:11,410 --> 00:25:11,420
the driving style of this person next to
 

1205
00:25:11,420 --> 00:25:13,150
the driving style of this person next to
you you'd like to know if they're in

1206
00:25:13,150 --> 00:25:13,160
you you'd like to know if they're in
 

1207
00:25:13,160 --> 00:25:14,740
you you'd like to know if they're in
particular if they're sort of aggressive

1208
00:25:14,740 --> 00:25:14,750
particular if they're sort of aggressive
 

1209
00:25:14,750 --> 00:25:16,780
particular if they're sort of aggressive
or defensive if they're gonna let you

1210
00:25:16,780 --> 00:25:16,790
or defensive if they're gonna let you
 

1211
00:25:16,790 --> 00:25:19,120
or defensive if they're gonna let you
kind of go in or if they're gonna not

1212
00:25:19,120 --> 00:25:19,130
kind of go in or if they're gonna not
 

1213
00:25:19,130 --> 00:25:25,180
kind of go in or if they're gonna not
and and it's very difficult to just you

1214
00:25:25,180 --> 00:25:25,190
and and it's very difficult to just you
 

1215
00:25:25,190 --> 00:25:27,250
and and it's very difficult to just you
know when if you think that if you want

1216
00:25:27,250 --> 00:25:27,260
know when if you think that if you want
 

1217
00:25:27,260 --> 00:25:28,780
know when if you think that if you want
to hedge your bets that maybe they're

1218
00:25:28,780 --> 00:25:28,790
to hedge your bets that maybe they're
 

1219
00:25:28,790 --> 00:25:30,640
to hedge your bets that maybe they're
actually pretty aggressive I shouldn't

1220
00:25:30,640 --> 00:25:30,650
actually pretty aggressive I shouldn't
 

1221
00:25:30,650 --> 00:25:32,470
actually pretty aggressive I shouldn't
ride this you kind of end up driving

1222
00:25:32,470 --> 00:25:32,480
ride this you kind of end up driving
 

1223
00:25:32,480 --> 00:25:34,270
ride this you kind of end up driving
next to them and driving next to them

1224
00:25:34,270 --> 00:25:34,280
next to them and driving next to them
 

1225
00:25:34,280 --> 00:25:36,220
next to them and driving next to them
right and then you you don't know

1226
00:25:36,220 --> 00:25:36,230
right and then you you don't know
 

1227
00:25:36,230 --> 00:25:38,800
right and then you you don't know
because you're not actually getting the

1228
00:25:38,800 --> 00:25:38,810
because you're not actually getting the
 

1229
00:25:38,810 --> 00:25:40,450
because you're not actually getting the
observations that you get away someone

1230
00:25:40,450 --> 00:25:40,460
observations that you get away someone
 

1231
00:25:40,460 --> 00:25:43,240
observations that you get away someone
drives when they're next to you and they

1232
00:25:43,240 --> 00:25:43,250
drives when they're next to you and they
 

1233
00:25:43,250 --> 00:25:44,740
drives when they're next to you and they
just need to go straight it's kind of

1234
00:25:44,740 --> 00:25:44,750
just need to go straight it's kind of
 

1235
00:25:44,750 --> 00:25:46,210
just need to go straight it's kind of
the same because if they're aggressive

1236
00:25:46,210 --> 00:25:46,220
the same because if they're aggressive
 

1237
00:25:46,220 --> 00:25:49,120
the same because if they're aggressive
or defensive and so you need to enable

1238
00:25:49,120 --> 00:25:49,130
or defensive and so you need to enable
 

1239
00:25:49,130 --> 00:25:53,560
or defensive and so you need to enable
the robot the reason about how it might

1240
00:25:53,560 --> 00:25:53,570
the robot the reason about how it might
 

1241
00:25:53,570 --> 00:25:55,240
the robot the reason about how it might
actually be able to gather information

1242
00:25:55,240 --> 00:25:55,250
actually be able to gather information
 

1243
00:25:55,250 --> 00:25:57,700
actually be able to gather information
by changing the actions that it's taking

1244
00:25:57,700 --> 00:25:57,710
by changing the actions that it's taking
 

1245
00:25:57,710 --> 00:25:59,350
by changing the actions that it's taking
and then the robot comes up with these

1246
00:25:59,350 --> 00:25:59,360
and then the robot comes up with these
 

1247
00:25:59,360 --> 00:26:01,240
and then the robot comes up with these
cool things where it kind of not just

1248
00:26:01,240 --> 00:26:01,250
cool things where it kind of not just
 

1249
00:26:01,250 --> 00:26:03,550
cool things where it kind of not just
towards you and then sees if you're

1250
00:26:03,550 --> 00:26:03,560
towards you and then sees if you're
 

1251
00:26:03,560 --> 00:26:05,770
towards you and then sees if you're
gonna slow down or not then if you slow

1252
00:26:05,770 --> 00:26:05,780
gonna slow down or not then if you slow
 

1253
00:26:05,780 --> 00:26:07,840
gonna slow down or not then if you slow
down it sort of updates its model of you

1254
00:26:07,840 --> 00:26:07,850
down it sort of updates its model of you
 

1255
00:26:07,850 --> 00:26:09,010
down it sort of updates its model of you
and says oh okay

1256
00:26:09,010 --> 00:26:09,020
and says oh okay
 

1257
00:26:09,020 --> 00:26:11,560
and says oh okay
you're more on the defensive side so now

1258
00:26:11,560 --> 00:26:11,570
you're more on the defensive side so now
 

1259
00:26:11,570 --> 00:26:13,270
you're more on the defensive side so now
I can actually that's a fascinating

00:26:13,270 --> 00:26:13,280
I can actually that's a fascinating
 

1261
00:26:13,280 --> 00:26:16,420
I can actually that's a fascinating

1262
00:26:16,420 --> 00:26:16,430
dance as so that's so cool
 

1263
00:26:16,430 --> 00:26:18,340
dance as so that's so cool
you could use your own actions to gather

1264
00:26:18,340 --> 00:26:18,350
you could use your own actions to gather
 

1265
00:26:18,350 --> 00:26:20,890
you could use your own actions to gather
information that's uh that feels like

I'm totally open exciting new world of
robotics prop I mean how many people are

1270
00:26:25,390 --> 00:26:25,400
robotics prop I mean how many people are
 

1271
00:26:25,400 --> 00:26:29,790
robotics prop I mean how many people are
even thinking about that kind of thing

1272
00:26:29,790 --> 00:26:29,800

 

1273
00:26:29,800 --> 00:26:32,860

to a lot of you know colleagues and so

1278
00:26:37,630 --> 00:26:37,640
to a lot of you know colleagues and so
 

1279
00:26:37,640 --> 00:26:40,930
to a lot of you know colleagues and so
on are kind of being honest kind of

on are kind of being honest kind of
 

1281
00:26:40,940 --> 00:26:43,600
on are kind of being honest kind of

afraid of humans because they're messy
 

1283
00:26:43,610 --> 00:26:46,480

00:26:46,480 --> 00:26:46,490
and complicated right I understand
 

1285
00:26:46,490 --> 00:26:49,060
and complicated right I understand
um going back to what we're talking

1286
00:26:49,060 --> 00:26:49,070
um going back to what we're talking
 

1287
00:26:49,070 --> 00:26:50,800
um going back to what we're talking
about earlier right now we're kind of in

1288
00:26:50,800 --> 00:26:50,810
about earlier right now we're kind of in

about earlier right now we're kind of in
this dilemma

this dilemma
 

1291
00:26:51,520 --> 00:26:53,669
this dilemma
okay there are tasks that we can just

1292
00:26:53,669 --> 00:26:53,679
okay there are tasks that we can just
 

1293
00:26:53,679 --> 00:26:55,470
okay there are tasks that we can just
assume people are approximately rational

1294

for and we can figure out what they want
we can figure out their goals in fear

1298
00:26:58,230 --> 00:26:58,240
we can figure out their goals in fear
 

1299
00:26:58,240 --> 00:26:59,940
we can figure out their goals in fear
are their driving styles whatever cool

1300
00:26:59,940 --> 00:26:59,950
are their driving styles whatever cool
 

1301
00:26:59,950 --> 00:27:02,970
are their driving styles whatever cool
they're these tasks that we can't so

1302
00:27:02,970 --> 00:27:02,980
they're these tasks that we can't so
 

1303
00:27:02,980 --> 00:27:04,530
they're these tasks that we can't so
what do we do right do we pack our bags

1304
00:27:04,530 --> 00:27:04,540
what do we do right do we pack our bags
 

1305
00:27:04,540 --> 00:27:08,370
what do we do right do we pack our bags
and go home and this one is just I've

1306
00:27:08,370 --> 00:27:08,380
and go home and this one is just I've
 

1307
00:27:08,380 --> 00:27:12,240
and go home and this one is just I've
had a little bit of hope recently um and

1308
00:27:12,240 --> 00:27:12,250
had a little bit of hope recently um and
 

1309
00:27:12,250 --> 00:27:14,070
had a little bit of hope recently um and
I'm kind of doubting myself scoff what

I'm kind of doubting myself scoff what

hectic especially to robots is that

00:28:16,799 --> 00:28:16,809
hectic especially to robots is that
 

1363

hectic especially to robots is that
perhaps they just make different

perhaps they just make different
 

1365
00:28:19,450 --> 00:28:22,530
perhaps they just make different

1366
00:28:22,530 --> 00:28:22,540
assumptions or have different beliefs so
 

1367
00:28:22,540 --> 00:28:24,270
assumptions or have different beliefs so
I mean that's that's another fascinating

00:28:24,270 --> 00:28:24,280
I mean that's that's another fascinating
 

1369

perhaps grounded behavioral economics is

1374
00:28:32,970 --> 00:28:32,980
perhaps grounded behavioral economics is
 

1375
00:28:32,980 --> 00:28:35,610
perhaps grounded behavioral economics is
is that we just don't understand the

1376
00:28:35,610 --> 00:28:35,620
is that we just don't understand the
 

1377
00:28:35,620 --> 00:28:37,380
is that we just don't understand the
constraints and their awards under which

1378
00:28:37,380 --> 00:28:37,390
constraints and their awards under which
 

1379
00:28:37,390 --> 00:28:39,299
constraints and their awards under which
they operate and so our goal shouldn't

1380
00:28:39,299 --> 00:28:39,309
they operate and so our goal shouldn't
 

1381
00:28:39,309 --> 00:28:41,580
they operate and so our goal shouldn't
be to throw our hands up and say they're

1382
00:28:41,580 --> 00:28:41,590
be to throw our hands up and say they're
 

1383
00:28:41,590 --> 00:28:44,160
be to throw our hands up and say they're
irrational is to say let's try to

1384
00:28:44,160 --> 00:28:44,170
irrational is to say let's try to
 

1385
00:28:44,170 --> 00:28:46,560
irrational is to say let's try to
understand what are the constraints what

1386
00:28:46,560 --> 00:28:46,570
understand what are the constraints what
 

1387
00:28:46,570 --> 00:28:48,000
understand what are the constraints what
it is that there must be assuming that

1388
00:28:48,000 --> 00:28:48,010
it is that there must be assuming that

00:28:48,010 --> 00:28:51,570
it is that there must be assuming that

there

00:29:06,250 --> 00:29:07,919
something you're missing and you know

00:29:07,919 --> 00:29:07,929
and it's you know it especially happens
 

1407
00:29:07,929 --> 00:29:09,210

00:29:12,100 --> 00:29:13,650
oftentimes people are sort of super
irrational and that they actually know a

1414
00:29:13,650 --> 00:29:13,660
irrational and that they actually know a
 

1415
00:29:13,660 --> 00:29:14,910
irrational and that they actually know a
lot of things that robots don't

1416
00:29:14,910 --> 00:29:14,920
lot of things that robots don't
 

1417
00:29:14,920 --> 00:29:18,000
lot of things that robots don't
sometimes like with the lunar lander the

1418
00:29:18,000 --> 00:29:18,010
sometimes like with the lunar lander the
 

1419
00:29:18,010 --> 00:29:21,750
sometimes like with the lunar lander the
robot you know knows much more so it

1420
00:29:21,750 --> 00:29:21,760
robot you know knows much more so it
 

1421
00:29:21,760 --> 00:29:24,210
robot you know knows much more so it
turns out that if you try to say look

1422
00:29:24,210 --> 00:29:24,220
turns out that if you try to say look
 

1423
00:29:24,220 --> 00:29:26,850
turns out that if you try to say look
maybe people are operating this thing

1424
00:29:26,850 --> 00:29:26,860
maybe people are operating this thing
 

1425
00:29:26,860 --> 00:29:30,210
maybe people are operating this thing
but assuming a much more simple fight

1426
00:29:30,210 --> 00:29:30,220
but assuming a much more simple fight
 

1427
00:29:30,220 --> 00:29:31,710
but assuming a much more simple fight
physics model because they don't get the

physics model because they don't get the
 

1429
00:29:31,720 --> 00:29:34,200
physics model because they don't get the
complexity of this kind of craft or the

1430
00:29:34,200 --> 00:29:34,210
complexity of this kind of craft or the
 

1431
00:29:34,210 --> 00:29:36,000
complexity of this kind of craft or the
robot arm with seven degrees of freedom

00:29:40,919 --> 00:29:40,929
maybe they have this intuitive physics
 

1437
00:29:40,929 --> 00:29:43,289
maybe they have this intuitive physics

Tenenbaum Tom Griffiths what kind of

1446
00:29:49,260 --> 00:29:49,270
Tenenbaum Tom Griffiths what kind of
 

1447
00:29:49,270 --> 00:29:53,430
Tenenbaum Tom Griffiths what kind of
stuff and and what we found is that you

1448
00:29:53,430 --> 00:29:53,440
stuff and and what we found is that you
 

1449
00:29:53,440 --> 00:29:57,419
stuff and and what we found is that you
can actually try to figure out what what

1450
00:29:57,419 --> 00:29:57,429
can actually try to figure out what what
 

1451
00:29:57,429 --> 00:29:59,310
can actually try to figure out what what
physics model kind of best explains

physics model kind of best explains
 

1453
00:29:59,320 --> 00:30:02,900
physics model kind of best explains
human actions and then you can use that

1454
00:30:02,900 --> 00:30:02,910
human actions and then you can use that
 

1455
00:30:02,910 --> 00:30:06,630
human actions and then you can use that
to sort of correct what it is that

1456
00:30:06,630 --> 00:30:06,640
to sort of correct what it is that
 

1457
00:30:06,640 --> 00:30:08,909
to sort of correct what it is that
they're commanding the craft to do so

1458
00:30:08,909 --> 00:30:08,919
they're commanding the craft to do so
 

1459
00:30:08,919 --> 00:30:10,620
they're commanding the craft to do so
they might you know be sending the craft

1460
00:30:10,620 --> 00:30:10,630
they might you know be sending the craft
 

1461
00:30:10,630 --> 00:30:12,570
they might you know be sending the craft
somewhere but instead of executing that

1462
00:30:12,570 --> 00:30:12,580
somewhere but instead of executing that
 

1463
00:30:12,580 --> 00:30:14,610
somewhere but instead of executing that
action you can sort of take a step back

and say according to their intuitive if

1466
00:30:17,010 --> 00:30:17,020
and say according to their intuitive if
 

1467
00:30:17,020 --> 00:30:18,780
and say according to their intuitive if
the world worked according their

1468

the world worked according their
intuitive physics model where do they

1470
00:30:22,110 --> 00:30:22,120
intuitive physics model where do they
 

1471
00:30:22,120 --> 00:30:23,909
intuitive physics model where do they
think that the craft is going war day

1472
00:30:23,909 --> 00:30:23,919
think that the craft is going war day
 

1473
00:30:23,919 --> 00:30:25,530
think that the craft is going war day
where are they trying to send it to and

1474
00:30:25,530 --> 00:30:25,540
where are they trying to send it to and
 

1475
00:30:25,540 --> 00:30:28,530
where are they trying to send it to and
then you can use the real physics right

1476
00:30:28,530 --> 00:30:28,540
then you can use the real physics right
 

1477
00:30:28,540 --> 00:30:30,000
then you can use the real physics right
the universe of that to actually figure

1478
00:30:30,000 --> 00:30:30,010
the universe of that to actually figure
 

1479
00:30:30,010 --> 00:30:31,230
the universe of that to actually figure
out what you should do so that you do

1480
00:30:31,230 --> 00:30:31,240
out what you should do so that you do
 

1481
00:30:31,240 --> 00:30:32,580
out what you should do so that you do
that instead of where they were actually

1482
00:30:32,580 --> 00:30:32,590
that instead of where they were actually
 

1483
00:30:32,590 --> 00:30:35,250
that instead of where they were actually
sending you in the real world and I kid

1484
00:30:35,250 --> 00:30:35,260
sending you in the real world and I kid
 

1485
00:30:35,260 --> 00:30:37,409
sending you in the real world and I kid
you not it word peopled landed there the

1486
00:30:37,409 --> 00:30:37,419
you not it word peopled landed there the
 

1487
00:30:37,419 --> 00:30:39,690
you not it word peopled landed there the
damn thing and you know in between the

1488
00:30:39,690 --> 00:30:39,700
damn thing and you know in between the
 

1489
00:30:39,700 --> 00:30:43,020
damn thing and you know in between the
two flags and and and all that so it's

1490
00:30:43,020 --> 00:30:43,030
two flags and and and all that so it's
 

1491
00:30:43,030 --> 00:30:45,630
two flags and and and all that so it's
not conclusive in any way but I'd say

1492
00:30:45,630 --> 00:30:45,640
not conclusive in any way but I'd say
 

1493
00:30:45,640 --> 00:30:46,710
not conclusive in any way but I'd say
it's evidence that

1494

it's evidence that
 

1495

it's evidence that
yeah maybe we're kind of under

00:30:48,299 --> 00:30:48,309
yeah maybe we're kind of under

00:30:48,309 --> 00:30:50,549
yeah maybe we're kind of under

1501
00:30:51,910 --> 00:30:54,930
we're giving up and saying oh there's
just crazy noisy then you then you try

1502
00:30:54,930 --> 00:30:54,940
just crazy noisy then you then you try
 

1503
00:30:54,940 --> 00:30:56,760
just crazy noisy then you then you try
to explicitly try to model the kind of

1504
00:30:56,760 --> 00:30:56,770
to explicitly try to model the kind of
 

1505
00:30:56,770 --> 00:30:58,560
to explicitly try to model the kind of

worldview that they that they have
 

1507
00:30:58,570 --> 00:31:01,830
worldview that they that they have
that's right that's right it's not to I

1508
00:31:01,830 --> 00:31:01,840
that's right that's right it's not to I
 

1509
00:31:01,840 --> 00:31:03,120
that's right that's right it's not to I
mean there's things to be here for

1510
00:31:03,120 --> 00:31:03,130
mean there's things to be here for
 

1511

00:31:04,600 --> 00:31:06,299
Konami's through that that that for
instance I've touched upon the planning

1514
00:31:06,299 --> 00:31:06,309
instance I've touched upon the planning
 

1515
00:31:06,309 --> 00:31:08,820
instance I've touched upon the planning
horizon so there's this idea that I just

1516
00:31:08,820 --> 00:31:08,830
horizon so there's this idea that I just
 

1517
00:31:08,830 --> 00:31:10,650
horizon so there's this idea that I just
bounded rationality essentially and the

1518
00:31:10,650 --> 00:31:10,660
bounded rationality essentially and the
 

1519
00:31:10,660 --> 00:31:12,090
bounded rationality essentially and the
idea that well maybe we work under

1520
00:31:12,090 --> 00:31:12,100
idea that well maybe we work under
 

1521
00:31:12,100 --> 00:31:14,400
idea that well maybe we work under
computational constraints and I think

1522
00:31:14,400 --> 00:31:14,410
computational constraints and I think
 

1523
00:31:14,410 --> 00:31:17,250
computational constraints and I think
kind of our view recently has been take

1531
00:31:23,510 --> 00:31:25,180
ways by saying state no no no the person
doesn't get to see the real state maybe

1532
00:31:25,180 --> 00:31:25,190
doesn't get to see the real state maybe
 

1533
00:31:25,190 --> 00:31:27,070
doesn't get to see the real state maybe
they're estimating somehow transition

00:31:27,070 --> 00:31:27,080
they're estimating somehow transition

like like you know when you watch

1542
00:31:36,850 --> 00:31:36,860
like like you know when you watch
 

1543
00:31:36,860 --> 00:31:38,890
like like you know when you watch
netflix and you know you have all the

1544
00:31:38,890 --> 00:31:38,900
netflix and you know you have all the
 

1545
00:31:38,900 --> 00:31:40,150
netflix and you know you have all the
things and then you have to pick

1546
00:31:40,150 --> 00:31:40,160
things and then you have to pick
 

1547
00:31:40,160 --> 00:31:43,570
things and then you have to pick
something imagine that you know the D

1548
00:31:43,570 --> 00:31:43,580
something imagine that you know the D
 

1549
00:31:43,580 --> 00:31:46,870

the AI system interpreted that choice as

1550
00:31:46,870 --> 00:31:46,880
the AI system interpreted that choice as

00:31:46,880 --> 00:31:48,940
the AI system interpreted that choice as
this is the thing you prefer to see and

1552
00:31:48,940 --> 00:31:48,950
this is the thing you prefer to see and
 

1553
00:31:48,950 --> 00:31:50,050
this is the thing you prefer to see and
how are you gonna know you're still

1554
00:31:50,050 --> 00:31:50,060
how are you gonna know you're still
 

1555
00:31:50,060 --> 00:31:51,430
how are you gonna know you're still
trying to figure out what you like what

1556
00:31:51,430 --> 00:31:51,440
trying to figure out what you like what
 

1557
00:31:51,440 --> 00:31:53,620
trying to figure out what you like what
you don't like etc so I mean it's

1558
00:31:53,620 --> 00:31:53,630
you don't like etc so I mean it's
 

1559
00:31:53,630 --> 00:31:55,630
you don't like etc so I mean it's
important to also account for that so

1560
00:31:55,630 --> 00:31:55,640
important to also account for that so
 

1561
00:31:55,640 --> 00:31:57,400
important to also account for that so
it's not irrationality precise doing the

1562
00:31:57,400 --> 00:31:57,410
it's not irrationality precise doing the
 

1563
00:31:57,410 --> 00:31:59,050
it's not irrationality precise doing the
right thing under the things that they

1564
00:31:59,050 --> 00:31:59,060
right thing under the things that they
 

1565
00:31:59,060 --> 00:32:01,060
right thing under the things that they
know yeah that's brilliant

1566
00:32:01,060 --> 00:32:01,070
know yeah that's brilliant
 

1567
00:32:01,070 --> 00:32:03,460
know yeah that's brilliant
you mentioned recommender systems what

00:32:03,460 --> 00:32:03,470
you mentioned recommender systems what
 

1569
00:32:03,470 --> 00:32:05,800
you mentioned recommender systems what
kind of and we're talking about human

1570
00:32:05,800 --> 00:32:05,810
kind of and we're talking about human
 

1571
00:32:05,810 --> 00:32:08,290
kind of and we're talking about human
robot interaction kind of problem spaces

1572
00:32:08,290 --> 00:32:08,300
robot interaction kind of problem spaces
 

1573
00:32:08,300 --> 00:32:13,660
robot interaction kind of problem spaces
are you thinking about so is it robots

1574
00:32:13,660 --> 00:32:13,670
are you thinking about so is it robots
 

1575
00:32:13,670 --> 00:32:15,370
are you thinking about so is it robots
like wheeled robots of autonomous

1576
00:32:15,370 --> 00:32:15,380
like wheeled robots of autonomous
 

1577
00:32:15,380 --> 00:32:18,670
like wheeled robots of autonomous
vehicles is it object manipulation like

1578
00:32:18,670 --> 00:32:18,680
vehicles is it object manipulation like
 

1579
00:32:18,680 --> 00:32:20,260
vehicles is it object manipulation like
when you think about human robot

1580
00:32:20,260 --> 00:32:20,270
when you think about human robot
 

1581
00:32:20,270 --> 00:32:23,530
when you think about human robot
interaction in your mind and maybe I'm

1582
00:32:23,530 --> 00:32:23,540
interaction in your mind and maybe I'm
 

1583
00:32:23,540 --> 00:32:24,850
interaction in your mind and maybe I'm
tree could speak for the entire

1584
00:32:24,850 --> 00:32:24,860
tree could speak for the entire
 

1585
00:32:24,860 --> 00:32:27,160
tree could speak for the entire
community of human robot interaction no

1586
00:32:27,160 --> 00:32:27,170
community of human robot interaction no
 

1587
00:32:27,170 --> 00:32:29,170
community of human robot interaction no
but like what are the problems of

1588
00:32:29,170 --> 00:32:29,180
but like what are the problems of
 

1589
00:32:29,180 --> 00:32:33,490
but like what are the problems of
interest here is and does it you know I

1590
00:32:33,490 --> 00:32:33,500
interest here is and does it you know I
 

1591
00:32:33,500 --> 00:32:39,040
interest here is and does it you know I
kind of think of open domain dialogue as

1592
00:32:39,040 --> 00:32:39,050
kind of think of open domain dialogue as
 

1593
00:32:39,050 --> 00:32:41,950
kind of think of open domain dialogue as
human robot interaction and that happens

1594
00:32:41,950 --> 00:32:41,960
human robot interaction and that happens
 

1595
00:32:41,960 --> 00:32:43,390
human robot interaction and that happens
not in the physical space but it could

1596
00:32:43,390 --> 00:32:43,400
not in the physical space but it could
 

1597
00:32:43,400 --> 00:32:46,600
not in the physical space but it could
just happen in in the virtual space so

1598
00:32:46,600 --> 00:32:46,610
just happen in in the virtual space so
 

1599
00:32:46,610 --> 00:32:48,580
just happen in in the virtual space so
word who wears the boundaries of this

1600
00:32:48,580 --> 00:32:48,590
word who wears the boundaries of this
 

1601
00:32:48,590 --> 00:32:50,260
word who wears the boundaries of this
field for you when you're thinking about

1602
00:32:50,260 --> 00:32:50,270
field for you when you're thinking about
 

1603
00:32:50,270 --> 00:32:52,030
field for you when you're thinking about
the things we've been talking about yeah

1604
00:32:52,030 --> 00:32:52,040
the things we've been talking about yeah
 

1605
00:32:52,040 --> 00:32:58,780
the things we've been talking about yeah
so I I tried to find kind of underlying

1606
00:32:58,780 --> 00:32:58,790
so I I tried to find kind of underlying
 

1607
00:32:58,790 --> 00:33:02,530
so I I tried to find kind of underlying
I don't know what to even call them I

1608
00:33:02,530 --> 00:33:02,540
I don't know what to even call them I
 

1609
00:33:02,540 --> 00:33:04,360
I don't know what to even call them I
get try to work on you know I might call

1610
00:33:04,360 --> 00:33:04,370
get try to work on you know I might call
 

1611
00:33:04,370 --> 00:33:06,820
get try to work on you know I might call
what I do the kind of working on the

1612
00:33:06,820 --> 00:33:06,830
what I do the kind of working on the
 

1613
00:33:06,830 --> 00:33:08,890
what I do the kind of working on the
foundations of algorithmic human robot

1614
00:33:08,890 --> 00:33:08,900
foundations of algorithmic human robot
 

1615
00:33:08,900 --> 00:33:10,240
foundations of algorithmic human robot
interaction and trying to make

1616
00:33:10,240 --> 00:33:10,250
interaction and trying to make
 

1617
00:33:10,250 --> 00:33:13,630
interaction and trying to make
contributions there and and it's

1618
00:33:13,630 --> 00:33:13,640
contributions there and and it's
 

1619
00:33:13,640 --> 00:33:16,060
contributions there and and it's
important to me that whatever we do is

1620
00:33:16,060 --> 00:33:16,070
important to me that whatever we do is
 

1621
00:33:16,070 --> 00:33:18,730
important to me that whatever we do is
actually somewhat domain agnostic when

1622
00:33:18,730 --> 00:33:18,740
actually somewhat domain agnostic when
 

1623
00:33:18,740 --> 00:33:22,140
actually somewhat domain agnostic when
it comes to is it about you know

1624
00:33:22,140 --> 00:33:22,150
it comes to is it about you know
 

1625
00:33:22,150 --> 00:33:25,650
it comes to is it about you know
autonomous cars or is it about

1626
00:33:25,650 --> 00:33:25,660
autonomous cars or is it about
 

1627
00:33:25,660 --> 00:33:29,350
autonomous cars or is it about
quadrotors or is it a basis or the same

1628
00:33:29,350 --> 00:33:29,360
quadrotors or is it a basis or the same
 

1629
00:33:29,360 --> 00:33:30,910
quadrotors or is it a basis or the same
underlying principles apply of course

1630
00:33:30,910 --> 00:33:30,920
underlying principles apply of course
 

1631
00:33:30,920 --> 00:33:32,350
underlying principles apply of course
when you're trying to get a particular

1632
00:33:32,350 --> 00:33:32,360
when you're trying to get a particular
 

1633
00:33:32,360 --> 00:33:33,850
when you're trying to get a particular
to work usually have to do some extra

1634
00:33:33,850 --> 00:33:33,860
to work usually have to do some extra
 

1635
00:33:33,860 --> 00:33:35,620
to work usually have to do some extra
work to adapt that to that particular

1636
00:33:35,620 --> 00:33:35,630
work to adapt that to that particular
 

1637
00:33:35,630 --> 00:33:37,480
work to adapt that to that particular
domain but these things that we were

1638
00:33:37,480 --> 00:33:37,490
domain but these things that we were
 

1639
00:33:37,490 --> 00:33:41,320
domain but these things that we were
talking about around well you know how

1640
00:33:41,320 --> 00:33:41,330
talking about around well you know how
 

1641
00:33:41,330 --> 00:33:43,090
talking about around well you know how
do you model humans it turns out that a

1642
00:33:43,090 --> 00:33:43,100
do you model humans it turns out that a
 

1643
00:33:43,100 --> 00:33:45,639
do you model humans it turns out that a
lot of systems need to quote benefit

1644
00:33:45,639 --> 00:33:45,649
lot of systems need to quote benefit
 

1645
00:33:45,649 --> 00:33:48,340
lot of systems need to quote benefit
from a better understanding of how human

1646
00:33:48,340 --> 00:33:48,350
from a better understanding of how human
 

1647
00:33:48,350 --> 00:33:51,100
from a better understanding of how human
behavior relates to what people want and

1648
00:33:51,100 --> 00:33:51,110
behavior relates to what people want and
 

1649
00:33:51,110 --> 00:33:53,769
behavior relates to what people want and
need to predict human behavior physical

1650
00:33:53,769 --> 00:33:53,779
need to predict human behavior physical
 

1651
00:33:53,779 --> 00:33:56,200
need to predict human behavior physical
robots of all sorts and and beyond that

1652
00:33:56,200 --> 00:33:56,210
robots of all sorts and and beyond that
 

1653
00:33:56,210 --> 00:33:58,779
robots of all sorts and and beyond that
and so I used to do manipulation I used

1654
00:33:58,779 --> 00:33:58,789
and so I used to do manipulation I used
 

1655
00:33:58,789 --> 00:34:00,789
and so I used to do manipulation I used
to be you know picking up stuff and then

1656
00:34:00,789 --> 00:34:00,799
to be you know picking up stuff and then
 

1657
00:34:00,799 --> 00:34:02,470
to be you know picking up stuff and then
I was picking up stuff with people

1658
00:34:02,470 --> 00:34:02,480
I was picking up stuff with people
 

1659
00:34:02,480 --> 00:34:05,710
I was picking up stuff with people
around and now it's sort of very broad

1660
00:34:05,710 --> 00:34:05,720
around and now it's sort of very broad
 

1661
00:34:05,720 --> 00:34:07,480
around and now it's sort of very broad
when it comes to the application level

1662
00:34:07,480 --> 00:34:07,490
when it comes to the application level
 

1663
00:34:07,490 --> 00:34:11,349
when it comes to the application level
but in a sense very focused on ok how

1664
00:34:11,349 --> 00:34:11,359
but in a sense very focused on ok how
 

1665
00:34:11,359 --> 00:34:14,260
but in a sense very focused on ok how
does the problem need to change how do

1666
00:34:14,260 --> 00:34:14,270
does the problem need to change how do
 

1667
00:34:14,270 --> 00:34:16,270
does the problem need to change how do
the algorithms need to change when we're

1668
00:34:16,270 --> 00:34:16,280
the algorithms need to change when we're
 

1669
00:34:16,280 --> 00:34:20,200
the algorithms need to change when we're
not doing a robot by itself you know

1670
00:34:20,200 --> 00:34:20,210
not doing a robot by itself you know
 

1671
00:34:20,210 --> 00:34:21,669
not doing a robot by itself you know
emptying the dishwasher but we're

1672
00:34:21,669 --> 00:34:21,679
emptying the dishwasher but we're
 

1673
00:34:21,679 --> 00:34:24,099
emptying the dishwasher but we're
stepping outside of that oh I thought

1674
00:34:24,099 --> 00:34:24,109
stepping outside of that oh I thought
 

1675
00:34:24,109 --> 00:34:26,980
stepping outside of that oh I thought
that popped into my head just now on the

1676
00:34:26,980 --> 00:34:26,990
that popped into my head just now on the
 

1677
00:34:26,990 --> 00:34:28,389
that popped into my head just now on the
game theoretic side I think you said

1678
00:34:28,389 --> 00:34:28,399
game theoretic side I think you said
 

1679
00:34:28,399 --> 00:34:30,399
game theoretic side I think you said
this really interesting idea of using

1680
00:34:30,399 --> 00:34:30,409
this really interesting idea of using
 

1681
00:34:30,409 --> 00:34:35,770
this really interesting idea of using
actions to gain more information but if

1682
00:34:35,770 --> 00:34:35,780
actions to gain more information but if
 

1683
00:34:35,780 --> 00:34:40,030
actions to gain more information but if
we think a sort of game theory the

1684
00:34:40,030 --> 00:34:40,040
we think a sort of game theory the
 

1685
00:34:40,040 --> 00:34:42,639
we think a sort of game theory the
humans that are interacting with you

1686
00:34:42,639 --> 00:34:42,649
humans that are interacting with you
 

1687
00:34:42,649 --> 00:34:46,649
humans that are interacting with you
with you the robot identity of the robot

1688
00:34:46,649 --> 00:34:46,659
with you the robot identity of the robot
 

1689
00:34:46,659 --> 00:34:53,409
with you the robot identity of the robot
yeah is they also have a world model of

1690
00:34:53,409 --> 00:34:53,419
yeah is they also have a world model of
 

1691
00:34:53,419 --> 00:34:54,510
yeah is they also have a world model of
you mm-hmm

1692
00:34:54,510 --> 00:34:54,520
you mm-hmm
 

1693
00:34:54,520 --> 00:34:57,910
you mm-hmm
and you can manipulate that and if we

1694
00:34:57,910 --> 00:34:57,920
and you can manipulate that and if we
 

1695
00:34:57,920 --> 00:35:00,460
and you can manipulate that and if we
look at autonomous vehicles people have

1696
00:35:00,460 --> 00:35:00,470
look at autonomous vehicles people have
 

1697
00:35:00,470 --> 00:35:02,200
look at autonomous vehicles people have
a certain viewpoint you said with the

1698
00:35:02,200 --> 00:35:02,210
a certain viewpoint you said with the
 

1699
00:35:02,210 --> 00:35:02,650
a certain viewpoint you said with the
kids

1700
00:35:02,650 --> 00:35:02,660
kids
 

1701
00:35:02,660 --> 00:35:06,120
kids
people see Alexa as a in a certain way

1702
00:35:06,120 --> 00:35:06,130
people see Alexa as a in a certain way
 

1703
00:35:06,130 --> 00:35:09,630
people see Alexa as a in a certain way
is there some value in trying to also

1704
00:35:09,630 --> 00:35:09,640
is there some value in trying to also
 

1705
00:35:09,640 --> 00:35:13,349
is there some value in trying to also
optimize how people see you as a robot

1706
00:35:13,349 --> 00:35:13,359
optimize how people see you as a robot
 

1707
00:35:13,359 --> 00:35:16,300
optimize how people see you as a robot
is that it or is that a little too far

1708
00:35:16,300 --> 00:35:16,310
is that it or is that a little too far
 

1709
00:35:16,310 --> 00:35:20,620
is that it or is that a little too far
and away from the specifics of what we

1710
00:35:20,620 --> 00:35:20,630
and away from the specifics of what we
 

1711
00:35:20,630 --> 00:35:24,550
and away from the specifics of what we
can solve right now so both right so

1712
00:35:24,550 --> 00:35:24,560
can solve right now so both right so
 

1713
00:35:24,560 --> 00:35:29,440
can solve right now so both right so
it's really interesting and we've seen a

1714
00:35:29,440 --> 00:35:29,450
it's really interesting and we've seen a
 

1715
00:35:29,450 --> 00:35:30,910
it's really interesting and we've seen a
little bit of progress on this problem

1716
00:35:30,910 --> 00:35:30,920
little bit of progress on this problem
 

1717
00:35:30,920 --> 00:35:34,020
little bit of progress on this problem
on pieces of this problem so you can

1718
00:35:34,020 --> 00:35:34,030
on pieces of this problem so you can
 

1719
00:35:34,030 --> 00:35:36,490
on pieces of this problem so you can
again it kind of comes down to how

1720
00:35:36,490 --> 00:35:36,500
again it kind of comes down to how
 

1721
00:35:36,500 --> 00:35:38,020
again it kind of comes down to how
complicated is the human model need to

1722
00:35:38,020 --> 00:35:38,030
complicated is the human model need to
 

1723
00:35:38,030 --> 00:35:41,680
complicated is the human model need to
be but in one piece of work that we were

1724
00:35:41,680 --> 00:35:41,690
be but in one piece of work that we were
 

1725
00:35:41,690 --> 00:35:44,710
be but in one piece of work that we were
looking at we just said ok there's these

1726
00:35:44,710 --> 00:35:44,720
looking at we just said ok there's these
 

1727
00:35:44,720 --> 00:35:46,000
looking at we just said ok there's these
in there's this

1728
00:35:46,000 --> 00:35:46,010
in there's this
 

1729
00:35:46,010 --> 00:35:48,340
in there's this
that are internal to the robot and their

1730
00:35:48,340 --> 00:35:48,350
that are internal to the robot and their
 

1731
00:35:48,350 --> 00:35:51,610
that are internal to the robot and their
what their what the robot is about to do

1732
00:35:51,610 --> 00:35:51,620
what their what the robot is about to do
 

1733
00:35:51,620 --> 00:35:53,080
what their what the robot is about to do
or maybe what objective what driving

1734
00:35:53,080 --> 00:35:53,090
or maybe what objective what driving
 

1735
00:35:53,090 --> 00:35:54,520
or maybe what objective what driving
style the robot has or something like

1736
00:35:54,520 --> 00:35:54,530
style the robot has or something like
 

1737
00:35:54,530 --> 00:35:57,220
style the robot has or something like
that and what we're gonna do is we're

1738
00:35:57,220 --> 00:35:57,230
that and what we're gonna do is we're
 

1739
00:35:57,230 --> 00:35:58,750
that and what we're gonna do is we're
going to set up a system where part of

1740
00:35:58,750 --> 00:35:58,760
going to set up a system where part of
 

1741
00:35:58,760 --> 00:36:00,640
going to set up a system where part of
the state is the person's belief over

1742
00:36:00,640 --> 00:36:00,650
the state is the person's belief over
 

1743
00:36:00,650 --> 00:36:04,210
the state is the person's belief over
those parameters and now when the robot

1744
00:36:04,210 --> 00:36:04,220
those parameters and now when the robot
 

1745
00:36:04,220 --> 00:36:07,540
those parameters and now when the robot
acts that the person gets new evidence

1746
00:36:07,540 --> 00:36:07,550
acts that the person gets new evidence
 

1747
00:36:07,550 --> 00:36:11,080
acts that the person gets new evidence
about this robot internal state and so

1748
00:36:11,080 --> 00:36:11,090
about this robot internal state and so
 

1749
00:36:11,090 --> 00:36:12,610
about this robot internal state and so
they're updating their mental model of

1750
00:36:12,610 --> 00:36:12,620
they're updating their mental model of
 

1751
00:36:12,620 --> 00:36:15,430
they're updating their mental model of
the robot right so if they see a card

1752
00:36:15,430 --> 00:36:15,440
the robot right so if they see a card
 

1753
00:36:15,440 --> 00:36:17,290
the robot right so if they see a card
that sort of cut someone off Tory god

1754
00:36:17,290 --> 00:36:17,300
that sort of cut someone off Tory god
 

1755
00:36:17,300 --> 00:36:18,730
that sort of cut someone off Tory god
that's an aggressive card they no more

1756
00:36:18,730 --> 00:36:18,740
that's an aggressive card they no more
 

1757
00:36:18,740 --> 00:36:22,780
that's an aggressive card they no more
right if they see sort of a robot head

1758
00:36:22,780 --> 00:36:22,790
right if they see sort of a robot head
 

1759
00:36:22,790 --> 00:36:24,310
right if they see sort of a robot head
towards a particular door they're like

1760
00:36:24,310 --> 00:36:24,320
towards a particular door they're like
 

1761
00:36:24,320 --> 00:36:25,690
towards a particular door they're like
are the robots trying to get to that

1762
00:36:25,690 --> 00:36:25,700
are the robots trying to get to that
 

1763
00:36:25,700 --> 00:36:27,520
are the robots trying to get to that
door so this thing that we have to do

1764
00:36:27,520 --> 00:36:27,530
door so this thing that we have to do
 

1765
00:36:27,530 --> 00:36:28,990
door so this thing that we have to do
with humans to try to understand their

1766
00:36:28,990 --> 00:36:29,000
with humans to try to understand their
 

1767
00:36:29,000 --> 00:36:32,110
with humans to try to understand their
goals and intentions humans are

1768
00:36:32,110 --> 00:36:32,120
goals and intentions humans are
 

1769
00:36:32,120 --> 00:36:34,420
goals and intentions humans are
inevitably gonna do that to robots and

1770
00:36:34,420 --> 00:36:34,430
inevitably gonna do that to robots and
 

1771
00:36:34,430 --> 00:36:36,220
inevitably gonna do that to robots and
then that raises this interesting

1772
00:36:36,220 --> 00:36:36,230
then that raises this interesting
 

1773
00:36:36,230 --> 00:36:37,900
then that raises this interesting
question that you asked which is can we

1774
00:36:37,900 --> 00:36:37,910
question that you asked which is can we
 

1775
00:36:37,910 --> 00:36:39,220
question that you asked which is can we
do something about that this is gonna

1776
00:36:39,220 --> 00:36:39,230
do something about that this is gonna
 

1777
00:36:39,230 --> 00:36:41,290
do something about that this is gonna
happen inevitably but we can sort of be

1778
00:36:41,290 --> 00:36:41,300
happen inevitably but we can sort of be
 

1779
00:36:41,300 --> 00:36:43,210
happen inevitably but we can sort of be
more confusing or less confusing to

1780
00:36:43,210 --> 00:36:43,220
more confusing or less confusing to
 

1781
00:36:43,220 --> 00:36:45,460
more confusing or less confusing to
people and it turns out you can optimize

1782
00:36:45,460 --> 00:36:45,470
people and it turns out you can optimize
 

1783
00:36:45,470 --> 00:36:48,100
people and it turns out you can optimize
for being more informative and less

1784
00:36:48,100 --> 00:36:48,110
for being more informative and less
 

1785
00:36:48,110 --> 00:36:50,320
for being more informative and less
confusing if you if you have an

1786
00:36:50,320 --> 00:36:50,330
confusing if you if you have an
 

1787
00:36:50,330 --> 00:36:52,000
confusing if you if you have an
understanding of how your actions are

1788
00:36:52,000 --> 00:36:52,010
understanding of how your actions are
 

1789
00:36:52,010 --> 00:36:53,740
understanding of how your actions are
being interpreted by the human how

1790
00:36:53,740 --> 00:36:53,750
being interpreted by the human how
 

1791
00:36:53,750 --> 00:36:55,540
being interpreted by the human how
they're using these actions to update

1792
00:36:55,540 --> 00:36:55,550
they're using these actions to update
 

1793
00:36:55,550 --> 00:36:57,850
they're using these actions to update
their belief and honesty all we did is

1794
00:36:57,850 --> 00:36:57,860
their belief and honesty all we did is
 

1795
00:36:57,860 --> 00:37:02,080
their belief and honesty all we did is
just Bayes rule basically okay first has

1796
00:37:02,080 --> 00:37:02,090
just Bayes rule basically okay first has
 

1797
00:37:02,090 --> 00:37:04,270
just Bayes rule basically okay first has
a belief they see an action they make

1798
00:37:04,270 --> 00:37:04,280
a belief they see an action they make
 

1799
00:37:04,280 --> 00:37:05,230
a belief they see an action they make
some assumptions about how the robot

1800
00:37:05,230 --> 00:37:05,240
some assumptions about how the robot
 

1801
00:37:05,240 --> 00:37:06,910
some assumptions about how the robot
generates its actions presumably is

1802
00:37:06,910 --> 00:37:06,920
generates its actions presumably is
 

1803
00:37:06,920 --> 00:37:08,260

being rational because robots are

1804
00:37:08,260 --> 00:37:08,270
being rational because robots are
 

1805
00:37:08,270 --> 00:37:10,120
being rational because robots are
rational see reasonable to assume that

1806
00:37:10,120 --> 00:37:10,130
rational see reasonable to assume that
 

1807
00:37:10,130 --> 00:37:13,330
rational see reasonable to assume that
about them and then they incorporate

1808
00:37:13,330 --> 00:37:13,340
about them and then they incorporate
 

1809
00:37:13,340 --> 00:37:17,410
about them and then they incorporate
that that new piece of evidence the

1810
00:37:17,410 --> 00:37:17,420
that that new piece of evidence the
 

1811
00:37:17,420 --> 00:37:19,510
that that new piece of evidence the
Bayesian sense and their belief and they

1812
00:37:19,510 --> 00:37:19,520
Bayesian sense and their belief and they
 

1813
00:37:19,520 --> 00:37:21,880
Bayesian sense and their belief and they
obtain a posterior and now the robot is

1814
00:37:21,880 --> 00:37:21,890
obtain a posterior and now the robot is
 

1815
00:37:21,890 --> 00:37:23,470
obtain a posterior and now the robot is
trying to figure out what actions to

1816
00:37:23,470 --> 00:37:23,480
trying to figure out what actions to
 

1817
00:37:23,480 --> 00:37:25,600
trying to figure out what actions to
take such that it steers the person's

1818
00:37:25,600 --> 00:37:25,610
take such that it steers the person's
 

1819
00:37:25,610 --> 00:37:27,280
take such that it steers the person's
belief to put as much probability mass

1820
00:37:27,280 --> 00:37:27,290
belief to put as much probability mass

00:37:29,920 --> 00:37:29,930
as possible on the correct on the
 

1823
00:37:29,930 --> 00:37:31,840
as possible on the correct on the
correct parameters so that's kind of a

1824
00:37:31,840 --> 00:37:31,850
correct parameters so that's kind of a
 

1825
00:37:31,850 --> 00:37:34,440
correct parameters so that's kind of a
mathematical formalization of that but

1826
00:37:34,440 --> 00:37:34,450
mathematical formalization of that but
 

1827
00:37:34,450 --> 00:37:37,900
mathematical formalization of that but
my worry and I don't know if you want to

1828
00:37:37,900 --> 00:37:37,910
my worry and I don't know if you want to
 

1829
00:37:37,910 --> 00:37:42,970
my worry and I don't know if you want to
go there with me but I about this quite

1830
00:37:42,970 --> 00:37:42,980
go there with me but I about this quite
 

1831
00:37:42,980 --> 00:37:46,270
go there with me but I about this quite
a bit um the the kids talking to alexa

1832
00:37:46,270 --> 00:37:46,280
a bit um the the kids talking to alexa
 

1833
00:37:46,280 --> 00:37:50,470
a bit um the the kids talking to alexa
disrespectfully worries me i worry in

1834
00:37:50,470 --> 00:37:50,480
disrespectfully worries me i worry in
 

1835
00:37:50,480 --> 00:37:52,540
disrespectfully worries me i worry in
general about human nature I guess I

1836
00:37:52,540 --> 00:37:52,550
general about human nature I guess I

I'm gonna do two so with the Holocaust

1840
00:37:56,440 --> 00:37:56,450
I'm gonna do two so with the Holocaust
 

1841
00:37:56,450 --> 00:37:59,830
I'm gonna do two so with the Holocaust
and everything I just worry about how we

1842
00:37:59,830 --> 00:37:59,840
and everything I just worry about how we
 

1843
00:37:59,840 --> 00:38:03,310
and everything I just worry about how we
sometimes treat the other the the group

1844
00:38:03,310 --> 00:38:03,320
sometimes treat the other the the group
 

1845
00:38:03,320 --> 00:38:04,900
sometimes treat the other the the group
that we call out or whatever it is

1846

that we call out or whatever it is

00:38:04,910 --> 00:38:06,610
that we call out or whatever it is
through human history the group that's

1848
00:38:06,610 --> 00:38:06,620
through human history the group that's
 

1849
00:38:06,620 --> 00:38:10,180
through human history the group that's
the other has been changed faces but it

1850
00:38:10,180 --> 00:38:10,190
the other has been changed faces but it
 

1851
00:38:10,190 --> 00:38:12,040
the other has been changed faces but it
seems like the robot will be the other

1852
00:38:12,040 --> 00:38:12,050
seems like the robot will be the other
 

1853
00:38:12,050 --> 00:38:17,200
seems like the robot will be the other
the other the the next the other and one

1854
00:38:17,200 --> 00:38:17,210
the other the the next the other and one
 

1855
00:38:17,210 --> 00:38:19,900
the other the the next the other and one
thing is it feels to me that robots

1856
00:38:19,900 --> 00:38:19,910
thing is it feels to me that robots
 

1857
00:38:19,910 --> 00:38:22,780
thing is it feels to me that robots
don't get no respect they get shoved

1858
00:38:22,780 --> 00:38:22,790
don't get no respect they get shoved
 

1859
00:38:22,790 --> 00:38:25,690
don't get no respect they get shoved
around shoved around in is there one at

companies might not be so happy with the
 

1873
00:38:39,980 --> 00:38:42,310
companies might not be so happy with the
idea that a robot has a little bit of an

00:38:42,310 --> 00:38:42,320
idea that a robot has a little bit of an
 

1875
00:38:42,320 --> 00:38:45,520
idea that a robot has a little bit of an
attitude but I feel it feels to me that

00:38:45,520 --> 00:38:45,530
attitude but I feel it feels to me that
 

1877

that's necessary to create a compelling
experience like we humans don't seem to

1880
00:38:49,510 --> 00:38:49,520
experience like we humans don't seem to
 

1881
00:38:49,520 --> 00:38:51,280
experience like we humans don't seem to
respect anything that doesn't give us

1882
00:38:51,280 --> 00:38:51,290
respect anything that doesn't give us
 

1883
00:38:51,290 --> 00:38:55,810
respect anything that doesn't give us
some attitude that or like Miss mix of

1884
00:38:55,810 --> 00:38:55,820
some attitude that or like Miss mix of
 

1885
00:38:55,820 --> 00:38:59,860
some attitude that or like Miss mix of
mystery and attitude and anger and did

1886
00:38:59,860 --> 00:38:59,870
mystery and attitude and anger and did
 

1887
00:38:59,870 --> 00:39:02,770
mystery and attitude and anger and did
that threatens us subtly maybe

1888
00:39:02,770 --> 00:39:02,780
that threatens us subtly maybe
 

1889
00:39:02,780 --> 00:39:04,900
that threatens us subtly maybe
passive-aggressively I don't it seems

1890
00:39:04,900 --> 00:39:04,910
passive-aggressively I don't it seems
 

1891
00:39:04,910 --> 00:39:08,830
passive-aggressively I don't it seems
like we humans yet need that dude what

1892
00:39:08,830 --> 00:39:08,840
like we humans yet need that dude what
 

1893
00:39:08,840 --> 00:39:10,390
like we humans yet need that dude what
are you is there something you have

1894
00:39:10,390 --> 00:39:10,400
are you is there something you have
 

1895
00:39:10,400 --> 00:39:16,260
are you is there something you have
thoughts on this one is one is it it's

1896
00:39:16,260 --> 00:39:16,270
thoughts on this one is one is it it's
 

1897
00:39:16,270 --> 00:39:19,750
thoughts on this one is one is it it's
we respond to you know someone being

1898
00:39:19,750 --> 00:39:19,760
we respond to you know someone being
 

1899
00:39:19,760 --> 00:39:24,730
we respond to you know someone being
assertive but we also respond to someone

1900
00:39:24,730 --> 00:39:24,740
assertive but we also respond to someone
 

1901
00:39:24,740 --> 00:39:27,460
assertive but we also respond to someone
being vulnerable so I think robots but

1902
00:39:27,460 --> 00:39:27,470
being vulnerable so I think robots but
 

1903
00:39:27,470 --> 00:39:28,810
being vulnerable so I think robots but
my first thought is that robots get

1904
00:39:28,810 --> 00:39:28,820
my first thought is that robots get
 

1905
00:39:28,820 --> 00:39:30,810
my first thought is that robots get
shoved around and and bullied a lot

1906
00:39:30,810 --> 00:39:30,820
shoved around and and bullied a lot
 

1907
00:39:30,820 --> 00:39:32,530
shoved around and and bullied a lot
because they're sort of you know

1908
00:39:32,530 --> 00:39:32,540
because they're sort of you know
 

1909
00:39:32,540 --> 00:39:34,420
because they're sort of you know
tempting and they're so showing off or

1910
00:39:34,420 --> 00:39:34,430
tempting and they're so showing off or
 

1911
00:39:34,430 --> 00:39:36,220
tempting and they're so showing off or
they appear to be showing off and so I

1912
00:39:36,220 --> 00:39:36,230
they appear to be showing off and so I
 

1913
00:39:36,230 --> 00:39:38,830
they appear to be showing off and so I
think current going back to these things

1914
00:39:38,830 --> 00:39:38,840
think current going back to these things
 

1915
00:39:38,840 --> 00:39:40,000
think current going back to these things
we were talking about in the beginning

1916
00:39:40,000 --> 00:39:40,010
we were talking about in the beginning
 

1917
00:39:40,010 --> 00:39:42,970
we were talking about in the beginning
of making robots a little more a little

1918
00:39:42,970 --> 00:39:42,980
of making robots a little more a little
 

1919
00:39:42,980 --> 00:39:44,920
of making robots a little more a little
more expressive a little bit more like

1920
00:39:44,920 --> 00:39:44,930
more expressive a little bit more like
 

1921
00:39:44,930 --> 00:39:47,560
more expressive a little bit more like
oh that wasn't cool to do and now I'm

1922
00:39:47,560 --> 00:39:47,570
oh that wasn't cool to do and now I'm
 

1923
00:39:47,570 --> 00:39:51,130
oh that wasn't cool to do and now I'm
bummed right I think that that can

1924
00:39:51,130 --> 00:39:51,140
bummed right I think that that can
 

1925
00:39:51,140 --> 00:39:52,450
bummed right I think that that can
actually help because people can't help

1926
00:39:52,450 --> 00:39:52,460
actually help because people can't help
 

1927
00:39:52,460 --> 00:39:54,190
actually help because people can't help
but anthropomorphize and respond to that

1928
00:39:54,190 --> 00:39:54,200
but anthropomorphize and respond to that
 

1929
00:39:54,200 --> 00:39:56,500
but anthropomorphize and respond to that
even that though the emotion being

1930
00:39:56,500 --> 00:39:56,510
even that though the emotion being
 

1931
00:39:56,510 --> 00:39:58,150
even that though the emotion being
communicate is not in any way a real

1932
00:39:58,150 --> 00:39:58,160
communicate is not in any way a real
 

1933
00:39:58,160 --> 00:40:00,070
communicate is not in any way a real
thing and people know that it's not a

1934
00:40:00,070 --> 00:40:00,080
thing and people know that it's not a
 

1935
00:40:00,080 --> 00:40:01,270
thing and people know that it's not a
real T because they know it's just a

1936
00:40:01,270 --> 00:40:01,280
real T because they know it's just a
 

1937
00:40:01,280 --> 00:40:01,690
real T because they know it's just a
machine

1938
00:40:01,690 --> 00:40:01,700
machine
 

1939
00:40:01,700 --> 00:40:03,550
machine
we're still interpret you know we can

1940
00:40:03,550 --> 00:40:03,560
we're still interpret you know we can
 

1941
00:40:03,560 --> 00:40:06,130
we're still interpret you know we can
work with we watch there's this a famous

1942
00:40:06,130 --> 00:40:06,140
work with we watch there's this a famous
 

1943
00:40:06,140 --> 00:40:07,870
work with we watch there's this a famous
psychology experiment with little

1944
00:40:07,870 --> 00:40:07,880
psychology experiment with little
 

1945
00:40:07,880 --> 00:40:11,020
psychology experiment with little
triangles and kind of dots on a screen

1946
00:40:11,020 --> 00:40:11,030
triangles and kind of dots on a screen
 

1947
00:40:11,030 --> 00:40:13,090
triangles and kind of dots on a screen
and a triangle is chasing the square and

1948
00:40:13,090 --> 00:40:13,100
and a triangle is chasing the square and
 

1949
00:40:13,100 --> 00:40:13,540
and a triangle is chasing the square and
get

1950
00:40:13,540 --> 00:40:13,550
get
 

1951
00:40:13,550 --> 00:40:16,360
get
angry at the darn triangle because why

1952
00:40:16,360 --> 00:40:16,370
angry at the darn triangle because why
 

1953
00:40:16,370 --> 00:40:18,670
angry at the darn triangle because why
is it not leaving the square alone so

1954
00:40:18,670 --> 00:40:18,680
is it not leaving the square alone so
 

1955
00:40:18,680 --> 00:40:20,440
is it not leaving the square alone so
that's yeah we can't helps that was the

1956
00:40:20,440 --> 00:40:20,450
that's yeah we can't helps that was the
 

1957
00:40:20,450 --> 00:40:22,300
that's yeah we can't helps that was the
first thought the vulnerability is

1958
00:40:22,300 --> 00:40:22,310
first thought the vulnerability is
 

1959
00:40:22,310 --> 00:40:26,320
first thought the vulnerability is
really interesting that I I think of

1960
00:40:26,320 --> 00:40:26,330
really interesting that I I think of
 

1961
00:40:26,330 --> 00:40:30,700
really interesting that I I think of
like being pushing back being assertive

1962
00:40:30,700 --> 00:40:30,710
like being pushing back being assertive
 

1963
00:40:30,710 --> 00:40:33,540
like being pushing back being assertive
as the only mechanism of getting of

1964
00:40:33,540 --> 00:40:33,550
as the only mechanism of getting of
 

1965
00:40:33,550 --> 00:40:35,830
as the only mechanism of getting of
forming a connection of gaining respect

1966
00:40:35,830 --> 00:40:35,840
forming a connection of gaining respect
 

1967
00:40:35,840 --> 00:40:38,170
forming a connection of gaining respect
but perhaps vulnerability perhaps

1968
00:40:38,170 --> 00:40:38,180
but perhaps vulnerability perhaps
 

1969
00:40:38,180 --> 00:40:39,550
but perhaps vulnerability perhaps
there's other mechanisms that are less

1970
00:40:39,550 --> 00:40:39,560
there's other mechanisms that are less
 

1971
00:40:39,560 --> 00:40:44,080
there's other mechanisms that are less
threatening yeah a little bit yes but

1972
00:40:44,080 --> 00:40:44,090
threatening yeah a little bit yes but
 

1973
00:40:44,090 --> 00:40:45,940
threatening yeah a little bit yes but
then this this other thing that we can

1974
00:40:45,940 --> 00:40:45,950
then this this other thing that we can
 

1975
00:40:45,950 --> 00:40:48,070
then this this other thing that we can
think about is it goes back to what you

1976
00:40:48,070 --> 00:40:48,080
think about is it goes back to what you
 

1977
00:40:48,080 --> 00:40:49,210
think about is it goes back to what you
were saying that interaction is really

1978
00:40:49,210 --> 00:40:49,220
were saying that interaction is really
 

1979
00:40:49,220 --> 00:40:51,220
were saying that interaction is really
game theoretic all right so the moment

1980
00:40:51,220 --> 00:40:51,230
game theoretic all right so the moment
 

1981
00:40:51,230 --> 00:40:52,630
game theoretic all right so the moment
you're taking actions in the space

1982
00:40:52,630 --> 00:40:52,640
you're taking actions in the space
 

1983
00:40:52,640 --> 00:40:54,370
you're taking actions in the space
humans are taking actions in that same

1984
00:40:54,370 --> 00:40:54,380
humans are taking actions in that same
 

1985
00:40:54,380 --> 00:40:57,340
humans are taking actions in that same
space but you have your own objective

1986
00:40:57,340 --> 00:40:57,350
space but you have your own objective
 

1987
00:40:57,350 --> 00:40:58,780
space but you have your own objective
which is you know you're a car you need

1988
00:40:58,780 --> 00:40:58,790
which is you know you're a car you need
 

1989
00:40:58,790 --> 00:41:00,460
which is you know you're a car you need
to get your passenger to the destination

1990
00:41:00,460 --> 00:41:00,470
to get your passenger to the destination
 

1991
00:41:00,470 --> 00:41:02,980
to get your passenger to the destination
and then the human nearby has their own

1992
00:41:02,980 --> 00:41:02,990
and then the human nearby has their own
 

1993
00:41:02,990 --> 00:41:04,990
and then the human nearby has their own
objective which someone overlaps with

1994
00:41:04,990 --> 00:41:05,000
objective which someone overlaps with
 

1995
00:41:05,000 --> 00:41:07,300
objective which someone overlaps with
you but not entirely you boat you're not

1996
00:41:07,300 --> 00:41:07,310
you but not entirely you boat you're not
 

1997
00:41:07,310 --> 00:41:08,950
you but not entirely you boat you're not
interested in getting into an accident

1998
00:41:08,950 --> 00:41:08,960
interested in getting into an accident
 

1999
00:41:08,960 --> 00:41:10,510
interested in getting into an accident
with each other but you have different

2000
00:41:10,510 --> 00:41:10,520
with each other but you have different
 

2001
00:41:10,520 --> 00:41:12,490
with each other but you have different
destinations and you want to get home

2002
00:41:12,490 --> 00:41:12,500
destinations and you want to get home
 

2003
00:41:12,500 --> 00:41:14,260
destinations and you want to get home
faster and they want to get home faster

2004
00:41:14,260 --> 00:41:14,270
faster and they want to get home faster
 

2005
00:41:14,270 --> 00:41:16,300
faster and they want to get home faster
and that's a general of some game at

2006
00:41:16,300 --> 00:41:16,310
and that's a general of some game at
 

2007
00:41:16,310 --> 00:41:19,870
and that's a general of some game at
that point and so that's I think that's

2008
00:41:19,870 --> 00:41:19,880
that point and so that's I think that's
 

2009
00:41:19,880 --> 00:41:23,560
that point and so that's I think that's
what it's reading it as such is kind of

2010
00:41:23,560 --> 00:41:23,570
what it's reading it as such is kind of
 

2011
00:41:23,570 --> 00:41:27,490
what it's reading it as such is kind of
a way we can step outside of this kind

2012
00:41:27,490 --> 00:41:27,500
a way we can step outside of this kind
 

2013
00:41:27,500 --> 00:41:30,760
a way we can step outside of this kind
of mode that where you try to anticipate

2014
00:41:30,760 --> 00:41:30,770
of mode that where you try to anticipate
 

2015
00:41:30,770 --> 00:41:32,980
of mode that where you try to anticipate
what people do and you don't realize you

2016
00:41:32,980 --> 00:41:32,990
what people do and you don't realize you
 

2017
00:41:32,990 --> 00:41:35,860
what people do and you don't realize you
have any influence over it while still

2018
00:41:35,860 --> 00:41:35,870
have any influence over it while still
 

2019
00:41:35,870 --> 00:41:37,960
have any influence over it while still
protecting yourself because your

2020
00:41:37,960 --> 00:41:37,970
protecting yourself because your
 

2021
00:41:37,970 --> 00:41:39,940
protecting yourself because your
understanding that people also

2022
00:41:39,940 --> 00:41:39,950
understanding that people also
 

2023
00:41:39,950 --> 00:41:41,680
understanding that people also
understand that they can influence you

2024
00:41:41,680 --> 00:41:41,690
understand that they can influence you
 

2025
00:41:41,690 --> 00:41:44,260
understand that they can influence you
and it's just kind of back and forth is

2026
00:41:44,260 --> 00:41:44,270
and it's just kind of back and forth is
 

2027
00:41:44,270 --> 00:41:46,870
and it's just kind of back and forth is
this negotiation which is really really

2028
00:41:46,870 --> 00:41:46,880
this negotiation which is really really
 

2029
00:41:46,880 --> 00:41:49,390
this negotiation which is really really
talking about different equilibria of a

2030
00:41:49,390 --> 00:41:49,400
talking about different equilibria of a
 

2031
00:41:49,400 --> 00:41:52,090
talking about different equilibria of a
game the very basic way to solve

2032
00:41:52,090 --> 00:41:52,100
game the very basic way to solve
 

2033
00:41:52,100 --> 00:41:54,580
game the very basic way to solve
coordination is to just make predictions

2034
00:41:54,580 --> 00:41:54,590
coordination is to just make predictions
 

2035
00:41:54,590 --> 00:41:56,320
coordination is to just make predictions
about what people will do and then stay

2036
00:41:56,320 --> 00:41:56,330
about what people will do and then stay
 

2037
00:41:56,330 --> 00:41:58,720
about what people will do and then stay
out of their way and that's hard for the

2038
00:41:58,720 --> 00:41:58,730
out of their way and that's hard for the
 

2039
00:41:58,730 --> 00:42:00,850
out of their way and that's hard for the
reasons we talked about which is how you

2040
00:42:00,850 --> 00:42:00,860
reasons we talked about which is how you
 

2041
00:42:00,860 --> 00:42:02,530
reasons we talked about which is how you
have to understand people's intentions

2042
00:42:02,530 --> 00:42:02,540
have to understand people's intentions
 

2043
00:42:02,540 --> 00:42:05,470
have to understand people's intentions
implicitly explicitly who knows but

2044
00:42:05,470 --> 00:42:05,480
implicitly explicitly who knows but
 

2045
00:42:05,480 --> 00:42:06,760
implicitly explicitly who knows but
somehow you have to get enough of an

2046
00:42:06,760 --> 00:42:06,770
somehow you have to get enough of an
 

2047
00:42:06,770 --> 00:42:08,140
somehow you have to get enough of an
understanding of that we all anticipate

2048
00:42:08,140 --> 00:42:08,150
understanding of that we all anticipate
 

2049
00:42:08,150 --> 00:42:11,320
understanding of that we all anticipate
what happens next and so that's

2050
00:42:11,320 --> 00:42:11,330
what happens next and so that's
 

2051
00:42:11,330 --> 00:42:12,790
what happens next and so that's
challenging but then it's further

2052
00:42:12,790 --> 00:42:12,800
challenging but then it's further
 

2053
00:42:12,800 --> 00:42:14,500
challenging but then it's further
challenged by the fact that people

2054
00:42:14,500 --> 00:42:14,510
challenged by the fact that people
 

2055
00:42:14,510 --> 00:42:17,110
challenged by the fact that people
change what they're do based on what you

2056
00:42:17,110 --> 00:42:17,120
change what they're do based on what you
 

2057
00:42:17,120 --> 00:42:19,480
change what they're do based on what you
do because they don't they don't plan in

2058
00:42:19,480 --> 00:42:19,490
do because they don't they don't plan in
 

2059
00:42:19,490 --> 00:42:21,850
do because they don't they don't plan in
isolation either right so when you see

2060
00:42:21,850 --> 00:42:21,860
isolation either right so when you see
 

2061
00:42:21,860 --> 00:42:24,720
isolation either right so when you see
cars trying to merge on a highway

2062
00:42:24,720 --> 00:42:24,730
cars trying to merge on a highway
 

2063
00:42:24,730 --> 00:42:27,300
cars trying to merge on a highway
and not succeeding one of the reasons

2064
00:42:27,300 --> 00:42:27,310
and not succeeding one of the reasons
 

2065
00:42:27,310 --> 00:42:30,660
and not succeeding one of the reasons
this can be is because you you they they

2066
00:42:30,660 --> 00:42:30,670
this can be is because you you they they
 

2067
00:42:30,670 --> 00:42:33,270
this can be is because you you they they
look at traffic that keeps coming they

2068
00:42:33,270 --> 00:42:33,280
look at traffic that keeps coming they
 

2069
00:42:33,280 --> 00:42:35,220
look at traffic that keeps coming they
predict what these people are planning

2070
00:42:35,220 --> 00:42:35,230
predict what these people are planning
 

2071
00:42:35,230 --> 00:42:37,470
predict what these people are planning
on doing which is to just keep going and

2072
00:42:37,470 --> 00:42:37,480
on doing which is to just keep going and
 

2073
00:42:37,480 --> 00:42:39,360
on doing which is to just keep going and
then they stay out of the way because

2074
00:42:39,360 --> 00:42:39,370
then they stay out of the way because
 

2075
00:42:39,370 --> 00:42:41,160
then they stay out of the way because
there's not there's no feasible plan

2076
00:42:41,160 --> 00:42:41,170
there's not there's no feasible plan
 

2077
00:42:41,170 --> 00:42:43,500
there's not there's no feasible plan
right any planning would actually

2078
00:42:43,500 --> 00:42:43,510
right any planning would actually
 

2079
00:42:43,510 --> 00:42:46,050
right any planning would actually
intersect with one of these other people

2080
00:42:46,050 --> 00:42:46,060
intersect with one of these other people
 

2081
00:42:46,060 --> 00:42:48,750
intersect with one of these other people
so that's bad so you get stuck there

2082
00:42:48,750 --> 00:42:48,760
so that's bad so you get stuck there
 

2083
00:42:48,760 --> 00:42:52,650
so that's bad so you get stuck there
so now kind of if if you start thinking

2084
00:42:52,650 --> 00:42:52,660
so now kind of if if you start thinking
 

2085
00:42:52,660 --> 00:42:54,960
so now kind of if if you start thinking
about it as no no no actually these

2086
00:42:54,960 --> 00:42:54,970
about it as no no no actually these
 

2087
00:42:54,970 --> 00:42:58,770
about it as no no no actually these
people change what they do depending on

2088
00:42:58,770 --> 00:42:58,780
people change what they do depending on
 

2089
00:42:58,780 --> 00:43:00,330
people change what they do depending on
what the car does like if the car

2090
00:43:00,330 --> 00:43:00,340
what the car does like if the car
 

2091
00:43:00,340 --> 00:43:02,430
what the car does like if the car
actually tries to kind of inch itself

2092
00:43:02,430 --> 00:43:02,440
actually tries to kind of inch itself
 

2093
00:43:02,440 --> 00:43:05,430
actually tries to kind of inch itself
forward they might actually slow down

2094
00:43:05,430 --> 00:43:05,440
forward they might actually slow down
 

2095
00:43:05,440 --> 00:43:09,120
forward they might actually slow down
and let the car in and down take an

2096
00:43:09,120 --> 00:43:09,130
and let the car in and down take an
 

2097
00:43:09,130 --> 00:43:11,280
and let the car in and down take an
advantage of that well that you know

2098
00:43:11,280 --> 00:43:11,290
advantage of that well that you know
 

2099
00:43:11,290 --> 00:43:13,890
advantage of that well that you know
that's kind of the next level we call

2100
00:43:13,890 --> 00:43:13,900
that's kind of the next level we call
 

2101
00:43:13,900 --> 00:43:15,630
that's kind of the next level we call
this like this under actuated system

2102
00:43:15,630 --> 00:43:15,640
this like this under actuated system
 

2103
00:43:15,640 --> 00:43:17,640
this like this under actuated system
idea where it's gonna under actresses

2104
00:43:17,640 --> 00:43:17,650
idea where it's gonna under actresses
 

2105
00:43:17,650 --> 00:43:20,640
idea where it's gonna under actresses
and robotics but it's kind of it's you

2106
00:43:20,640 --> 00:43:20,650
and robotics but it's kind of it's you
 

2107
00:43:20,650 --> 00:43:22,800
and robotics but it's kind of it's you
don't your influence these other degrees

2108
00:43:22,800 --> 00:43:22,810
don't your influence these other degrees
 

2109
00:43:22,810 --> 00:43:24,150
don't your influence these other degrees
of freedom but you don't get to decide

2110
00:43:24,150 --> 00:43:24,160
of freedom but you don't get to decide
 

2111
00:43:24,160 --> 00:43:27,660
of freedom but you don't get to decide
what somewhere it's seen you mention it

2112
00:43:27,660 --> 00:43:27,670
what somewhere it's seen you mention it
 

2113
00:43:27,670 --> 00:43:29,850
what somewhere it's seen you mention it
this the the human element in this

2114
00:43:29,850 --> 00:43:29,860
this the the human element in this
 

2115
00:43:29,860 --> 00:43:32,730
this the the human element in this
picture as under actuate it said you

2116
00:43:32,730 --> 00:43:32,740
picture as under actuate it said you
 

2117
00:43:32,740 --> 00:43:34,500
picture as under actuate it said you
know you understand under actuator about

2118
00:43:34,500 --> 00:43:34,510
know you understand under actuator about
 

2119
00:43:34,510 --> 00:43:38,970
know you understand under actuator about
robotics is you know that you can't

2120
00:43:38,970 --> 00:43:38,980
robotics is you know that you can't
 

2121
00:43:38,980 --> 00:43:41,880
robotics is you know that you can't
fully control the system so you can't go

2122
00:43:41,880 --> 00:43:41,890
fully control the system so you can't go
 

2123
00:43:41,890 --> 00:43:43,620
fully control the system so you can't go
in arbitrary directions in the

2124
00:43:43,620 --> 00:43:43,630
in arbitrary directions in the
 

2125
00:43:43,630 --> 00:43:45,540
in arbitrary directions in the
configuration space under your control

2126
00:43:45,540 --> 00:43:45,550
configuration space under your control
 

2127
00:43:45,550 --> 00:43:48,180
configuration space under your control
yeah it's a very simple way of under

2128
00:43:48,180 --> 00:43:48,190
yeah it's a very simple way of under
 

2129
00:43:48,190 --> 00:43:49,710
yeah it's a very simple way of under
actuation where basically there's

2130
00:43:49,710 --> 00:43:49,720
actuation where basically there's
 

2131
00:43:49,720 --> 00:43:51,120
actuation where basically there's
literally these degrees of freedom that

2132
00:43:51,120 --> 00:43:51,130
literally these degrees of freedom that
 

2133
00:43:51,130 --> 00:43:52,740
literally these degrees of freedom that
you can control and these are affirmed

2134
00:43:52,740 --> 00:43:52,750
you can control and these are affirmed
 

2135
00:43:52,750 --> 00:43:54,510
you can control and these are affirmed
that you can't but you influence them

2136
00:43:54,510 --> 00:43:54,520
that you can't but you influence them
 

2137
00:43:54,520 --> 00:43:55,920
that you can't but you influence them
and I think that's the important part is

2138
00:43:55,920 --> 00:43:55,930
and I think that's the important part is
 

2139
00:43:55,930 --> 00:43:58,680
and I think that's the important part is
that they don't do whatever regardless

2140
00:43:58,680 --> 00:43:58,690
that they don't do whatever regardless
 

2141
00:43:58,690 --> 00:44:00,540
that they don't do whatever regardless
of what you do that what you do

2142
00:44:00,540 --> 00:44:00,550
of what you do that what you do
 

2143
00:44:00,550 --> 00:44:02,310
of what you do that what you do
influence is what they end up doing I

2144
00:44:02,310 --> 00:44:02,320
influence is what they end up doing I
 

2145
00:44:02,320 --> 00:44:04,650
influence is what they end up doing I
just also like the the poetry of calling

2146
00:44:04,650 --> 00:44:04,660
just also like the the poetry of calling
 

2147
00:44:04,660 --> 00:44:06,660
just also like the the poetry of calling
human robot interaction and under

2148
00:44:06,660 --> 00:44:06,670
human robot interaction and under
 

2149
00:44:06,670 --> 00:44:10,080
human robot interaction and under
actuated robotics problem and y'all so

2150
00:44:10,080 --> 00:44:10,090
actuated robotics problem and y'all so
 

2151
00:44:10,090 --> 00:44:12,710
actuated robotics problem and y'all so
much sort of nudging it seems that there

2152
00:44:12,710 --> 00:44:12,720
much sort of nudging it seems that there
 

2153
00:44:12,720 --> 00:44:14,970
much sort of nudging it seems that there
and I don't know I think about this a

2154
00:44:14,970 --> 00:44:14,980
and I don't know I think about this a
 

2155
00:44:14,980 --> 00:44:16,710
and I don't know I think about this a
lot in the case of pedestrians I've

2156
00:44:16,710 --> 00:44:16,720
lot in the case of pedestrians I've
 

2157
00:44:16,720 --> 00:44:18,750
lot in the case of pedestrians I've
collected hundreds of hours of videos I

2158
00:44:18,750 --> 00:44:18,760
collected hundreds of hours of videos I
 

2159
00:44:18,760 --> 00:44:21,060
collected hundreds of hours of videos I
like to just watch pedestrians mmm-hmm

2160
00:44:21,060 --> 00:44:21,070
like to just watch pedestrians mmm-hmm
 

2161
00:44:21,070 --> 00:44:23,610
like to just watch pedestrians mmm-hmm
and it seems that it's a funny hobby

2162
00:44:23,610 --> 00:44:23,620
and it seems that it's a funny hobby
 

2163
00:44:23,620 --> 00:44:26,730
and it seems that it's a funny hobby
yeah it's weird because I learn a lot I

2164
00:44:26,730 --> 00:44:26,740
yeah it's weird because I learn a lot I
 

2165
00:44:26,740 --> 00:44:28,980
yeah it's weird because I learn a lot I
learned a lot about myself about our

2166
00:44:28,980 --> 00:44:28,990
learned a lot about myself about our
 

2167
00:44:28,990 --> 00:44:31,890
learned a lot about myself about our
human human behavior from watching

2168
00:44:31,890 --> 00:44:31,900
human human behavior from watching
 

2169
00:44:31,900 --> 00:44:34,200
human human behavior from watching
pedestrians watching people in their

2170
00:44:34,200 --> 00:44:34,210
pedestrians watching people in their
 

2171
00:44:34,210 --> 00:44:37,110
pedestrians watching people in their
environment basically crossing the

2172
00:44:37,110 --> 00:44:37,120
environment basically crossing the
 

2173
00:44:37,120 --> 00:44:38,279
environment basically crossing the
street is

2174
00:44:38,279 --> 00:44:38,289
street is
 

2175
00:44:38,289 --> 00:44:41,279
street is
you're putting your life on the line you

2176
00:44:41,279 --> 00:44:41,289
you're putting your life on the line you
 

2177
00:44:41,289 --> 00:44:42,929
you're putting your life on the line you
know I don't know tens of millions of

2178
00:44:42,929 --> 00:44:42,939
know I don't know tens of millions of
 

2179
00:44:42,939 --> 00:44:45,179
know I don't know tens of millions of
time in America every day is people are

2180
00:44:45,179 --> 00:44:45,189
time in America every day is people are
 

2181
00:44:45,189 --> 00:44:47,789
time in America every day is people are
just like playing this weird game of

2182
00:44:47,789 --> 00:44:47,799
just like playing this weird game of
 

2183
00:44:47,799 --> 00:44:49,769
just like playing this weird game of
chicken when they cross the street

2184
00:44:49,769 --> 00:44:49,779
chicken when they cross the street
 

2185
00:44:49,779 --> 00:44:51,419
chicken when they cross the street
especially when there's some ambiguity

2186
00:44:51,419 --> 00:44:51,429
especially when there's some ambiguity
 

2187
00:44:51,429 --> 00:44:54,959
especially when there's some ambiguity
about the right-of-way that has to do

2188
00:44:54,959 --> 00:44:54,969
about the right-of-way that has to do
 

2189
00:44:54,969 --> 00:44:56,579

don't you know it seems that people

don't you know it seems that people
 

2199
00:45:06,400 --> 00:45:08,429
don't you know it seems that people
don't even nudge they just aggressively

2200
00:45:08,429 --> 00:45:08,439
don't even nudge they just aggressively

solved about that well let's pause there

2310
00:47:29,940 --> 00:47:29,950
solved about that well let's pause there
 

2311
00:47:29,950 --> 00:47:33,510
solved about that well let's pause there
i I think I agree with you that guy and

2312
00:47:33,510 --> 00:47:33,520
i I think I agree with you that guy and
 

2313
00:47:33,520 --> 00:47:36,180
i I think I agree with you that guy and
I think a lot of people here will agree

2314
00:47:36,180 --> 00:47:36,190
I think a lot of people here will agree
 

2315
00:47:36,190 --> 00:47:40,020
I think a lot of people here will agree
with that but we need to sort of

2316
00:47:40,020 --> 00:47:40,030
with that but we need to sort of
 

2317
00:47:40,030 --> 00:47:42,210
with that but we need to sort of
internalize that idea so what's the

2318
00:47:42,210 --> 00:47:42,220
internalize that idea so what's the
 

2319
00:47:42,220 --> 00:47:43,590
internalize that idea so what's the
problem there because we're not quite

2320
00:47:43,590 --> 00:47:43,600
problem there because we're not quite
 

2321
00:47:43,600 --> 00:47:46,080
problem there because we're not quite
yet be done with that because a lot of

2322
00:47:46,080 --> 00:47:46,090
yet be done with that because a lot of
 

2323
00:47:46,090 --> 00:47:47,580
yet be done with that because a lot of
people kind of focus on the perception

2324
00:47:47,580 --> 00:47:47,590
people kind of focus on the perception
 

2325
00:47:47,590 --> 00:47:51,720
people kind of focus on the perception
problem well a lot of people kind of map

2326
00:47:51,720 --> 00:47:51,730
problem well a lot of people kind of map
 

2327
00:47:51,730 --> 00:47:53,760

intuition there behind your statement
 

2339
00:48:09,640 --> 00:48:11,640
intuition there behind your statement
was we might have not solved the yet but

2340
00:48:11,640 --> 00:48:11,650
was we might have not solved the yet but
 

2341
00:48:11,650 --> 00:48:13,560
was we might have not solved the yet but
were close to solving basically the

00:48:13,560 --> 00:48:13,570
were close to solving basically the
 

2343
00:48:13,570 --> 00:48:15,390
were close to solving basically the
perceptual problem I think the

2344
00:48:15,390 --> 00:48:15,400
perceptual problem I think the
 

2345
00:48:15,400 --> 00:48:18,240
perceptual problem I think the
perception problem I mean and by the way

2346
00:48:18,240 --> 00:48:18,250
perception problem I mean and by the way
 

2347
00:48:18,250 --> 00:48:20,190
perception problem I mean and by the way
a bunch of years ago this would not have

2348
00:48:20,190 --> 00:48:20,200
a bunch of years ago this would not have
 

2349
00:48:20,200 --> 00:48:23,340
a bunch of years ago this would not have
been true and a lot of issues and the

2350
00:48:23,340 --> 00:48:23,350
been true and a lot of issues and the
 

2351
00:48:23,350 --> 00:48:25,080
been true and a lot of issues and the
space can't we're coming from the fact

2352
00:48:25,080 --> 00:48:25,090
space can't we're coming from the fact
 

2353
00:48:25,090 --> 00:48:27,300
space can't we're coming from the fact
that we don't really you know we don't

2354
00:48:27,300 --> 00:48:27,310
that we don't really you know we don't
 

2355
00:48:27,310 --> 00:48:31,260
that we don't really you know we don't
know what's what's where but I think

2356
00:48:31,260 --> 00:48:31,270
know what's what's where but I think
 

2357
00:48:31,270 --> 00:48:33,390
know what's what's where but I think
it's fairly safe to say that at this

2358
00:48:33,390 --> 00:48:33,400
it's fairly safe to say that at this
 

2359
00:48:33,400 --> 00:48:35,130
it's fairly safe to say that at this
point although you could always improve

2360
00:48:35,130 --> 00:48:35,140
point although you could always improve
 

2361
00:48:35,140 --> 00:48:37,560
point although you could always improve
on things and all of that you can drive

2362
00:48:37,560 --> 00:48:37,570
on things and all of that you can drive
 

2363
00:48:37,570 --> 00:48:39,060
on things and all of that you can drive
through downtown San Francisco if there

2364
00:48:39,060 --> 00:48:39,070
through downtown San Francisco if there
 

2365
00:48:39,070 --> 00:48:41,460
through downtown San Francisco if there
are no people around there's no really

2366
00:48:41,460 --> 00:48:41,470
are no people around there's no really
 

2367
00:48:41,470 --> 00:48:43,290
are no people around there's no really
perception issue standing in your way

2368
00:48:43,290 --> 00:48:43,300
perception issue standing in your way
 

2369
00:48:43,300 --> 00:48:46,470
perception issue standing in your way
there any perception is hard but yeah

2370
00:48:46,470 --> 00:48:46,480
there any perception is hard but yeah
 

2371
00:48:46,480 --> 00:48:48,660
there any perception is hard but yeah
it's we've made a lot of progress on the

2372
00:48:48,660 --> 00:48:48,670
it's we've made a lot of progress on the
 

2373
00:48:48,670 --> 00:48:50,070
it's we've made a lot of progress on the
perceptions on how to undermine the

2374
00:48:50,070 --> 00:48:50,080
perceptions on how to undermine the
 

2375
00:48:50,080 --> 00:48:51,150
perceptions on how to undermine the
difficulty of the problem I think

2376
00:48:51,150 --> 00:48:51,160
difficulty of the problem I think
 

2377
00:48:51,160 --> 00:48:52,530
difficulty of the problem I think
everything about robotics is really

2378
00:48:52,530 --> 00:48:52,540
everything about robotics is really
 

2379
00:48:52,540 --> 00:48:55,910
everything about robotics is really
difficult of course you know the the

2380
00:48:55,910 --> 00:48:55,920
difficult of course you know the the
 

2381
00:48:55,920 --> 00:48:58,110
difficult of course you know the the
planning problem the control problem all

2382
00:48:58,110 --> 00:48:58,120
planning problem the control problem all
 

2383
00:48:58,120 --> 00:49:00,780
planning problem the control problem all
very difficult but I think what's what

2384
00:49:00,780 --> 00:49:00,790
very difficult but I think what's what
 

2385
00:49:00,790 --> 00:49:03,780
very difficult but I think what's what
makes it really you know yeah it might

2386
00:49:03,780 --> 00:49:03,790
makes it really you know yeah it might
 

2387
00:49:03,790 --> 00:49:05,009
makes it really you know yeah it might
be I mean you know

2388
00:49:05,009 --> 00:49:05,019
be I mean you know
 

2389
00:49:05,019 --> 00:49:06,779
be I mean you know
and I picked downtown San Francisco I

2390
00:49:06,779 --> 00:49:06,789
and I picked downtown San Francisco I
 

2391
00:49:06,789 --> 00:49:11,219
and I picked downtown San Francisco I
ate adapting to well now it's snowing

2392
00:49:11,219 --> 00:49:11,229
ate adapting to well now it's snowing
 

2393
00:49:11,229 --> 00:49:13,049
ate adapting to well now it's snowing
now is no longer snowing now it's

2394
00:49:13,049 --> 00:49:13,059
now is no longer snowing now it's
 

2395
00:49:13,059 --> 00:49:15,329
now is no longer snowing now it's
slippery in this way now so the dynamics

2396
00:49:15,329 --> 00:49:15,339
slippery in this way now so the dynamics
 

2397
00:49:15,339 --> 00:49:19,279
slippery in this way now so the dynamics
part could good I could imagine being

2398
00:49:19,279 --> 00:49:19,289
part could good I could imagine being
 

2399
00:49:19,289 --> 00:49:24,209
part could good I could imagine being
being still somewhat challenging but no

2400
00:49:24,209 --> 00:49:24,219
being still somewhat challenging but no
 

2401
00:49:24,219 --> 00:49:26,099
being still somewhat challenging but no
the thing that I think worries us and

2402
00:49:26,099 --> 00:49:26,109
the thing that I think worries us and
 

2403
00:49:26,109 --> 00:49:28,409
the thing that I think worries us and
our tuition is not good there is the

2404
00:49:28,409 --> 00:49:28,419
our tuition is not good there is the
 

2405
00:49:28,419 --> 00:49:30,679
our tuition is not good there is the
perceptual problem at the edge cases

2406
00:49:30,679 --> 00:49:30,689
perceptual problem at the edge cases
 

2407
00:49:30,689 --> 00:49:33,929
perceptual problem at the edge cases
sort of stout sauce and Francisco the

2408
00:49:33,929 --> 00:49:33,939
sort of stout sauce and Francisco the
 

2409
00:49:33,939 --> 00:49:37,289
sort of stout sauce and Francisco the
nice thing it's not actually it may not

2410
00:49:37,289 --> 00:49:37,299
nice thing it's not actually it may not
 

2411
00:49:37,299 --> 00:49:40,109
nice thing it's not actually it may not
be a good example because cuz you know

2412
00:49:40,109 --> 00:49:40,119
be a good example because cuz you know
 

2413
00:49:40,119 --> 00:49:41,370
be a good example because cuz you know
what - what you're getting for all

2414
00:49:41,370 --> 00:49:41,380
what - what you're getting for all
 

2415
00:49:41,380 --> 00:49:42,779
what - what you're getting for all
there's like because crazy construction

2416
00:49:42,779 --> 00:49:42,789
there's like because crazy construction
 

2417
00:49:42,789 --> 00:49:44,189
there's like because crazy construction
zones and all yeah but the thing is

2418
00:49:44,189 --> 00:49:44,199
zones and all yeah but the thing is
 

2419
00:49:44,199 --> 00:49:46,649
zones and all yeah but the thing is
you're travelling at slow speeds so it

2420
00:49:46,649 --> 00:49:46,659
you're travelling at slow speeds so it
 

2421
00:49:46,659 --> 00:49:48,659
you're travelling at slow speeds so it
doesn't feel dangerous to me what feels

2422
00:49:48,659 --> 00:49:48,669
doesn't feel dangerous to me what feels
 

2423
00:49:48,669 --> 00:49:51,149
doesn't feel dangerous to me what feels
dangerous is highway speeds when

2424
00:49:51,149 --> 00:49:51,159
dangerous is highway speeds when
 

2425
00:49:51,159 --> 00:49:54,299
dangerous is highway speeds when
everything is to us humans super clear

2426
00:49:54,299 --> 00:49:54,309
everything is to us humans super clear
 

2427
00:49:54,309 --> 00:49:56,370
everything is to us humans super clear
yeah I'm assuming light are here by the

2428
00:49:56,370 --> 00:49:56,380
yeah I'm assuming light are here by the
 

2429
00:49:56,380 --> 00:49:58,439
yeah I'm assuming light are here by the
way I think it's kind of irresponsible

2430
00:49:58,439 --> 00:49:58,449
way I think it's kind of irresponsible
 

2431
00:49:58,449 --> 00:50:00,089
way I think it's kind of irresponsible
to not use lighter that's just my

2432
00:50:00,089 --> 00:50:00,099
to not use lighter that's just my
 

2433
00:50:00,099 --> 00:50:03,120
to not use lighter that's just my
personal opinion

2434
00:50:03,120 --> 00:50:03,130

 

2435
00:50:03,130 --> 00:50:04,949

depending on your use case but I think

2436
00:50:04,949 --> 00:50:04,959
depending on your use case but I think
 

2437
00:50:04,959 --> 00:50:06,959
depending on your use case but I think
like you know if you if you have the

2438
00:50:06,959 --> 00:50:06,969
like you know if you if you have the
 

2439
00:50:06,969 --> 00:50:12,479
like you know if you if you have the
opportunity to use light are good your

2440
00:50:12,479 --> 00:50:12,489
opportunity to use light are good your
 

2441
00:50:12,489 --> 00:50:13,979
opportunity to use light are good your
injury makes more sense now so you don't

2442
00:50:13,979 --> 00:50:13,989
injury makes more sense now so you don't
 

2443
00:50:13,989 --> 00:50:17,099
injury makes more sense now so you don't
think vision I really just don't know

2444
00:50:17,099 --> 00:50:17,109
think vision I really just don't know
 

2445
00:50:17,109 --> 00:50:20,519
think vision I really just don't know
enough to say well vision alone what you

2446
00:50:20,519 --> 00:50:20,529
enough to say well vision alone what you
 

2447
00:50:20,529 --> 00:50:22,829
enough to say well vision alone what you
know what's like I there's a lot of how

2448
00:50:22,829 --> 00:50:22,839
know what's like I there's a lot of how
 

2449
00:50:22,839 --> 00:50:27,629
know what's like I there's a lot of how
many cameras do you have there's all

2450
00:50:27,629 --> 00:50:27,639
many cameras do you have there's all
 

2451
00:50:27,639 --> 00:50:29,249
many cameras do you have there's all
sorts of details I imagine their stuff

2452
00:50:29,249 --> 00:50:29,259
sorts of details I imagine their stuff
 

2453
00:50:29,259 --> 00:50:32,009
sorts of details I imagine their stuff
is really hard to actually see how do

2454
00:50:32,009 --> 00:50:32,019
is really hard to actually see how do
 

2455
00:50:32,019 --> 00:50:34,229
is really hard to actually see how do
you deal with would glare exactly what

2456
00:50:34,229 --> 00:50:34,239
you deal with would glare exactly what
 

2457
00:50:34,239 --> 00:50:35,429
you deal with would glare exactly what
you're saying stuff that people would

2458
00:50:35,429 --> 00:50:35,439
you're saying stuff that people would
 

2459
00:50:35,439 --> 00:50:38,399
you're saying stuff that people would
see that that that you don't I I think I

2460
00:50:38,399 --> 00:50:38,409
see that that that you don't I I think I
 

2461
00:50:38,409 --> 00:50:40,259
see that that that you don't I I think I
have more my intuition comes from

2462
00:50:40,259 --> 00:50:40,269
have more my intuition comes from
 

2463
00:50:40,269 --> 00:50:42,689
have more my intuition comes from
systems that can actually use lighter as

2464
00:50:42,689 --> 00:50:42,699
systems that can actually use lighter as
 

2465
00:50:42,699 --> 00:50:45,839
systems that can actually use lighter as
well yeah until we know for sure it's

2466
00:50:45,839 --> 00:50:45,849
well yeah until we know for sure it's
 

2467
00:50:45,849 --> 00:50:48,329
well yeah until we know for sure it's
make sense to be using lidar that's kind

2468
00:50:48,329 --> 00:50:48,339
make sense to be using lidar that's kind
 

2469
00:50:48,339 --> 00:50:51,209
make sense to be using lidar that's kind
of the safety focus but then deserve the

2470
00:50:51,209 --> 00:50:51,219
of the safety focus but then deserve the
 

2471
00:50:51,219 --> 00:50:54,769
of the safety focus but then deserve the
I also sympathize with the Elon Musk the

2472
00:50:54,769 --> 00:50:54,779
I also sympathize with the Elon Musk the
 

2473
00:50:54,779 --> 00:50:58,229
I also sympathize with the Elon Musk the
statement of lidar as a crutch it's it's

2474
00:50:58,229 --> 00:50:58,239
statement of lidar as a crutch it's it's
 

2475
00:50:58,239 --> 00:51:01,919
statement of lidar as a crutch it's it's
it's uh it's a fun notion to think that

2476
00:51:01,919 --> 00:51:01,929
it's uh it's a fun notion to think that
 

2477
00:51:01,929 --> 00:51:05,219
it's uh it's a fun notion to think that
the things that work today is a crutch

2478
00:51:05,219 --> 00:51:05,229
the things that work today is a crutch
 

2479
00:51:05,229 --> 00:51:08,099
the things that work today is a crutch
for the invention of the things that

2480
00:51:08,099 --> 00:51:08,109
for the invention of the things that
 

2481
00:51:08,109 --> 00:51:12,029
for the invention of the things that
will work tomorrow right they get it's

2482
00:51:12,029 --> 00:51:12,039
will work tomorrow right they get it's
 

2483
00:51:12,039 --> 00:51:15,569
will work tomorrow right they get it's
kind of true in the sense that if we you

2484
00:51:15,569 --> 00:51:15,579
kind of true in the sense that if we you
 

2485
00:51:15,579 --> 00:51:16,829
kind of true in the sense that if we you
know that we want to stick to the

2486
00:51:16,829 --> 00:51:16,839
know that we want to stick to the
 

2487
00:51:16,839 --> 00:51:18,329
know that we want to stick to the
conference and you see this in academic

2488
00:51:18,329 --> 00:51:18,339
conference and you see this in academic
 

2489
00:51:18,339 --> 00:51:18,720
conference and you see this in academic
and

2490
00:51:18,720 --> 00:51:18,730
and
 

2491
00:51:18,730 --> 00:51:20,460
and
settings all the time the things that

2492
00:51:20,460 --> 00:51:20,470
settings all the time the things that
 

2493
00:51:20,470 --> 00:51:23,880
settings all the time the things that
work force you to not explore outside

2494
00:51:23,880 --> 00:51:23,890
work force you to not explore outside
 

2495
00:51:23,890 --> 00:51:25,650
work force you to not explore outside
think outside the box I mean that

2496
00:51:25,650 --> 00:51:25,660
think outside the box I mean that
 

2497
00:51:25,660 --> 00:51:27,630
think outside the box I mean that
happened all of that the problem is in

2498
00:51:27,630 --> 00:51:27,640
happened all of that the problem is in
 

2499
00:51:27,640 --> 00:51:29,580
happened all of that the problem is in
safety critical systems you kind of want

2500
00:51:29,580 --> 00:51:29,590
safety critical systems you kind of want
 

2501
00:51:29,590 --> 00:51:32,190
safety critical systems you kind of want
to stick with a thing Sutekh work so

2502
00:51:32,190 --> 00:51:32,200
to stick with a thing Sutekh work so
 

2503
00:51:32,200 --> 00:51:34,230
to stick with a thing Sutekh work so
it's a it's an interesting and difficult

2504
00:51:34,230 --> 00:51:34,240
it's a it's an interesting and difficult
 

2505
00:51:34,240 --> 00:51:36,420
it's a it's an interesting and difficult
trade-off in the in the in the case of

00:51:36,420 --> 00:51:36,430
trade-off in the in the in the case of
 

2507
00:51:36,430 --> 00:51:38,099
trade-off in the in the in the case of
real-world sort of safety critical

2508
00:51:38,099 --> 00:51:38,109
real-world sort of safety critical
 

2509
00:51:38,109 --> 00:51:44,120
real-world sort of safety critical
robotic systems but so your intuition is

2510
00:51:44,120 --> 00:51:44,130
robotic systems but so your intuition is
 

2511
00:51:44,130 --> 00:51:48,720
robotic systems but so your intuition is
just to clarify yes how I mean how hard

2512
00:51:48,720 --> 00:51:48,730
just to clarify yes how I mean how hard
 

2513
00:51:48,730 --> 00:51:51,599
just to clarify yes how I mean how hard
is this human element forger like how

2514
00:51:51,599 --> 00:51:51,609
is this human element forger like how
 

2515
00:51:51,609 --> 00:51:53,849
is this human element forger like how
hard is driving when this human element

2516
00:51:53,849 --> 00:51:53,859
hard is driving when this human element
 

2517
00:51:53,859 --> 00:51:59,010

is involved are we years decades away

2518
00:51:59,010 --> 00:51:59,020
is involved are we years decades away
 

2519
00:51:59,020 --> 00:52:01,230
is involved are we years decades away
from solving it but perhaps actually the

2520
00:52:01,230 --> 00:52:01,240
from solving it but perhaps actually the
 

2521
00:52:01,240 --> 00:52:03,960
from solving it but perhaps actually the
years and the the thing I'm asking it

2522
00:52:03,960 --> 00:52:03,970
years and the the thing I'm asking it
 

2523
00:52:03,970 --> 00:52:05,609
years and the the thing I'm asking it
doesn't matter what the timeline is but

2524
00:52:05,609 --> 00:52:05,619
doesn't matter what the timeline is but
 

2525
00:52:05,619 --> 00:52:08,430
doesn't matter what the timeline is but
do you think we're how many

2526
00:52:08,430 --> 00:52:08,440
do you think we're how many
 

2527
00:52:08,440 --> 00:52:11,760
do you think we're how many
breakthroughs away away from its in

2528
00:52:11,760 --> 00:52:11,770
breakthroughs away away from its in
 

2529
00:52:11,770 --> 00:52:12,900
breakthroughs away away from its in
solving the human robot interaction

2530
00:52:12,900 --> 00:52:12,910
solving the human robot interaction
 

2531
00:52:12,910 --> 00:52:15,300
solving the human robot interaction
problem to get this to get this right I

2532
00:52:15,300 --> 00:52:15,310
problem to get this to get this right I
 

2533
00:52:15,310 --> 00:52:20,430
problem to get this to get this right I
think it in a sense it really depends I

2534
00:52:20,430 --> 00:52:20,440
think it in a sense it really depends I
 

2535
00:52:20,440 --> 00:52:23,400
think it in a sense it really depends I
think that you know we were talking

2536
00:52:23,400 --> 00:52:23,410
think that you know we were talking
 

2537
00:52:23,410 --> 00:52:25,020
think that you know we were talking
about how well look it's really hard

2538
00:52:25,020 --> 00:52:25,030
about how well look it's really hard
 

2539
00:52:25,030 --> 00:52:26,880
about how well look it's really hard
because I'm just know people do is hard

2540
00:52:26,880 --> 00:52:26,890
because I'm just know people do is hard
 

2541
00:52:26,890 --> 00:52:29,490
because I'm just know people do is hard
and on top of that playing the game is

2542
00:52:29,490 --> 00:52:29,500
and on top of that playing the game is
 

2543
00:52:29,500 --> 00:52:34,020
and on top of that playing the game is
hard but I think we sort of have the

2544
00:52:34,020 --> 00:52:34,030
hard but I think we sort of have the
 

2545
00:52:34,030 --> 00:52:36,960
hard but I think we sort of have the
fundamental some of the fundamental

2546
00:52:36,960 --> 00:52:36,970
fundamental some of the fundamental
 

2547
00:52:36,970 --> 00:52:38,940
fundamental some of the fundamental
understanding for that and then you

2548
00:52:38,940 --> 00:52:38,950
understanding for that and then you
 

2549
00:52:38,950 --> 00:52:41,400
understanding for that and then you
already see that these systems are being

2550
00:52:41,400 --> 00:52:41,410
already see that these systems are being
 

2551
00:52:41,410 --> 00:52:45,870
already see that these systems are being
deployed in the real world you know even

2552
00:52:45,870 --> 00:52:45,880
deployed in the real world you know even
 

2553
00:52:45,880 --> 00:52:48,930
deployed in the real world you know even
even driverless because I think now a

2554
00:52:48,930 --> 00:52:48,940
even driverless because I think now a
 

2555
00:52:48,940 --> 00:52:53,940
even driverless because I think now a
few companies that don't have a driver

2556
00:52:53,940 --> 00:52:53,950
few companies that don't have a driver
 

2557

shot a video with lame-o and you need to

2562
00:53:03,359 --> 00:53:03,369
shot a video with lame-o and you need to
 

2563
00:53:03,369 --> 00:53:05,609
shot a video with lame-o and you need to
get that video out people didn't give me

2564
00:53:05,609 --> 00:53:05,619
get that video out people didn't give me
 

2565
00:53:05,619 --> 00:53:08,370
get that video out people didn't give me

work being done there and it's one of
 

2569
00:53:09,910 --> 00:53:11,609
work being done there and it's one of
those other seminal moments for me in my

00:53:11,609 --> 00:53:11,619
those other seminal moments for me in my

00:53:14,040 --> 00:53:14,050
life to be able to it sounds silly but
 

2573
00:53:14,050 --> 00:53:15,810
life to be able to it sounds silly but
to be able to drive without a with a

2574
00:53:15,810 --> 00:53:15,820
to be able to drive without a with a
 

2575
00:53:15,820 --> 00:53:19,140

2577
00:53:19,150 --> 00:53:22,440

I mean I was an incredible robotics I

2578
00:53:22,440 --> 00:53:22,450
I mean I was an incredible robotics I
 

2579
00:53:22,450 --> 00:53:26,849
I mean I was an incredible robotics I
was driven by a robot and without being

2580
00:53:26,849 --> 00:53:26,859
was driven by a robot and without being
 

2581
00:53:26,859 --> 00:53:29,560
was driven by a robot and without being
able to take over without being able to

2582
00:53:29,560 --> 00:53:29,570
able to take over without being able to
 

2583
00:53:29,570 --> 00:53:31,990
able to take over without being able to
take the steering wheel that's a magical

2584
00:53:31,990 --> 00:53:32,000
take the steering wheel that's a magical
 

2585
00:53:32,000 --> 00:53:34,090
take the steering wheel that's a magical
that's a magical moment so in that

2586
00:53:34,090 --> 00:53:34,100
that's a magical moment so in that
 

2587
00:53:34,100 --> 00:53:35,980
that's a magical moment so in that
regard and those domains at least for

2588
00:53:35,980 --> 00:53:35,990
regard and those domains at least for
 

2589
00:53:35,990 --> 00:53:38,590
regard and those domains at least for
like way mo they're there they're

00:53:38,590 --> 00:53:38,600
like way mo they're there they're
 

2591
00:53:38,600 --> 00:53:41,050
like way mo they're there they're
solving that human there's I mean there

2592
00:53:41,050 --> 00:53:41,060
solving that human there's I mean there
 

2593
00:53:41,060 --> 00:53:42,970
solving that human there's I mean there
were they're going fattening it felt

2594
00:53:42,970 --> 00:53:42,980
were they're going fattening it felt
 

2595
00:53:42,980 --> 00:53:45,190

first I was this is my first experience

2598
00:53:46,630 --> 00:53:46,640
first I was this is my first experience
 

2599
00:53:46,640 --> 00:53:48,520
first I was this is my first experience
but it's going like the speed limit

2600
00:53:48,520 --> 00:53:48,530
but it's going like the speed limit
 

2601
00:53:48,530 --> 00:53:51,520
but it's going like the speed limit
right 30 40 whatever it is and there's

2602
00:53:51,520 --> 00:53:51,530
right 30 40 whatever it is and there's
 

2603
00:53:51,530 --> 00:53:53,590
right 30 40 whatever it is and there's
humans and it deals with them quite well

2604
00:53:53,590 --> 00:53:53,600
humans and it deals with them quite well
 

2605
00:53:53,600 --> 00:53:56,140
humans and it deals with them quite well
I detects them and a good negotiation

2606
00:53:56,140 --> 00:53:56,150
I detects them and a good negotiation
 

2607
00:53:56,150 --> 00:53:57,850
I detects them and a good negotiation
the intersections the left turns and all

2608
00:53:57,850 --> 00:53:57,860
the intersections the left turns and all
 

2609
00:53:57,860 --> 00:53:59,950
the intersections the left turns and all
that so at least in those domains it's

2610
00:53:59,950 --> 00:53:59,960
that so at least in those domains it's
 

2611
00:53:59,960 --> 00:54:02,440
that so at least in those domains it's
solving them the open question for me is

2612
00:54:02,440 --> 00:54:02,450
solving them the open question for me is
 

2613
00:54:02,450 --> 00:54:06,100
solving them the open question for me is
like how quickly can we expand you know

2614
00:54:06,100 --> 00:54:06,110
like how quickly can we expand you know
 

2615
00:54:06,110 --> 00:54:09,310
like how quickly can we expand you know
that's the you know outside of the

2616
00:54:09,310 --> 00:54:09,320
that's the you know outside of the
 

2617
00:54:09,320 --> 00:54:10,750
that's the you know outside of the
weather conditions all those kinds of

2618
00:54:10,750 --> 00:54:10,760
weather conditions all those kinds of
 

2619
00:54:10,760 --> 00:54:12,850
weather conditions all those kinds of
things how quickly can we expand to like

2620
00:54:12,850 --> 00:54:12,860
things how quickly can we expand to like
 

2621
00:54:12,860 --> 00:54:15,160
things how quickly can we expand to like
cities like San Francisco yeah and I

2622
00:54:15,160 --> 00:54:15,170
cities like San Francisco yeah and I
 

2623
00:54:15,170 --> 00:54:17,260
cities like San Francisco yeah and I
wouldn't say that it's just you know now

2624
00:54:17,260 --> 00:54:17,270
wouldn't say that it's just you know now
 

2625
00:54:17,270 --> 00:54:19,540
wouldn't say that it's just you know now
it's just pure engineering and it's

2626
00:54:19,540 --> 00:54:19,550
it's just pure engineering and it's
 

2627
00:54:19,550 --> 00:54:21,850
it's just pure engineering and it's
probably the I mean I know by the way

2628
00:54:21,850 --> 00:54:21,860
probably the I mean I know by the way
 

2629
00:54:21,860 --> 00:54:24,400
probably the I mean I know by the way
I'm speaking kind of very generally here

2630
00:54:24,400 --> 00:54:24,410
I'm speaking kind of very generally here
 

2631
00:54:24,410 --> 00:54:29,170
I'm speaking kind of very generally here
as hypothesizing but I I think that that

2632
00:54:29,170 --> 00:54:29,180
as hypothesizing but I I think that that
 

2633
00:54:29,180 --> 00:54:32,580
as hypothesizing but I I think that that
there are successes and yet no one is

2634
00:54:32,580 --> 00:54:32,590
there are successes and yet no one is
 

2635
00:54:32,590 --> 00:54:35,680
there are successes and yet no one is
everywhere out there so that seems to

2636
00:54:35,680 --> 00:54:35,690
everywhere out there so that seems to
 

2637
00:54:35,690 --> 00:54:38,950
everywhere out there so that seems to
suggest that things can be expanded and

2638
00:54:38,950 --> 00:54:38,960
suggest that things can be expanded and
 

2639
00:54:38,960 --> 00:54:40,810
suggest that things can be expanded and
can be scaled and we know how to do a

2640
00:54:40,810 --> 00:54:40,820
can be scaled and we know how to do a
 

2641
00:54:40,820 --> 00:54:42,790
can be scaled and we know how to do a
lot of things but they're still probably

2642
00:54:42,790 --> 00:54:42,800
lot of things but they're still probably
 

2643
00:54:42,800 --> 00:54:45,940
lot of things but they're still probably
you know new algorithms or modified

2644
00:54:45,940 --> 00:54:45,950
you know new algorithms or modified
 

2645
00:54:45,950 --> 00:54:48,490
you know new algorithms or modified
algorithms that that you still need to

2646
00:54:48,490 --> 00:54:48,500
algorithms that that you still need to
 

2647
00:54:48,500 --> 00:54:50,560
algorithms that that you still need to
put in there as you as you learn more

2648
00:54:50,560 --> 00:54:50,570
put in there as you as you learn more
 

2649
00:54:50,570 --> 00:54:54,070
put in there as you as you learn more
and more about new challenges that get

that means well guess why do you need to

I think they have to be a combination
because if you get some human data and

2806
00:58:19,480 --> 00:58:19,490
because if you get some human data and
 

2807
00:58:19,490 --> 00:58:21,460
because if you get some human data and
then you say this is hog this is gonna

2808
00:58:21,460 --> 00:58:21,470
then you say this is hog this is gonna
 

2809
00:58:21,470 --> 00:58:23,230
then you say this is hog this is gonna
be my model of per the person what are

2810
00:58:23,230 --> 00:58:23,240
be my model of per the person what are
 

2811
00:58:23,240 --> 00:58:25,120
be my model of per the person what are
for simulation and training or for just

2812
00:58:25,120 --> 00:58:25,130
for simulation and training or for just
 

2813
00:58:25,130 --> 00:58:26,290
for simulation and training or for just
deployment time and that's what I'm

2814
00:58:26,290 --> 00:58:26,300
deployment time and that's what I'm
 

2815
00:58:26,300 --> 00:58:28,330
deployment time and that's what I'm
planning with as my model of how people

2816
00:58:28,330 --> 00:58:28,340
planning with as my model of how people
 

2817
00:58:28,340 --> 00:58:32,650
planning with as my model of how people
work regardless if you take some data um

2818
00:58:32,650 --> 00:58:32,660
work regardless if you take some data um
 

2819
00:58:32,660 --> 00:58:34,870
work regardless if you take some data um
and you don't assume anything else and

2820
00:58:34,870 --> 00:58:34,880
and you don't assume anything else and
 

2821
00:58:34,880 --> 00:58:37,930
and you don't assume anything else and
you just say okay this is this is some

2822
00:58:37,930 --> 00:58:37,940
you just say okay this is this is some
 

2823
00:58:37,940 --> 00:58:39,610
you just say okay this is this is some
data that I've collected let me fit a

2824
00:58:39,610 --> 00:58:39,620
data that I've collected let me fit a
 

2825
00:58:39,620 --> 00:58:42,340
data that I've collected let me fit a
policy to help people work based on that

2826
00:58:42,340 --> 00:58:42,350
policy to help people work based on that
 

2827
00:58:42,350 --> 00:58:44,410
policy to help people work based on that
what does to happen is you collected

2828
00:58:44,410 --> 00:58:44,420
what does to happen is you collected
 

2829
00:58:44,420 --> 00:58:47,170
what does to happen is you collected
some data in some distribution and then

2830
00:58:47,170 --> 00:58:47,180
some data in some distribution and then
 

2831
00:58:47,180 --> 00:58:51,850
some data in some distribution and then
now you're your robot it computes a best

2832
00:58:51,850 --> 00:58:51,860
now you're your robot it computes a best
 

2833
00:58:51,860 --> 00:58:53,770
now you're your robot it computes a best
response to that right is sort what

2834
00:58:53,770 --> 00:58:53,780
response to that right is sort what
 

2835
00:58:53,780 --> 00:58:55,600
response to that right is sort what
should I do if this is how people work

2836
00:58:55,600 --> 00:58:55,610
should I do if this is how people work
 

2837
00:58:55,610 --> 00:58:58,480
should I do if this is how people work
and easily goes off of distribution

2838
00:58:58,480 --> 00:58:58,490
and easily goes off of distribution
 

2839
00:58:58,490 --> 00:59:00,490
and easily goes off of distribution
where that model that you've built of

2840
00:59:00,490 --> 00:59:00,500
where that model that you've built of
 

2841
00:59:00,500 --> 00:59:02,440
where that model that you've built of
the human completely sucks because out

2842
00:59:02,440 --> 00:59:02,450
the human completely sucks because out
 

2843
00:59:02,450 --> 00:59:04,420
the human completely sucks because out
of distribution you have no idea right

2844
00:59:04,420 --> 00:59:04,430
of distribution you have no idea right
 

2845
00:59:04,430 --> 00:59:06,850
of distribution you have no idea right
there's if you think of all the possible

2846
00:59:06,850 --> 00:59:06,860
there's if you think of all the possible
 

2847
00:59:06,860 --> 00:59:09,760
there's if you think of all the possible
policies and then you take only the ones

2848
00:59:09,760 --> 00:59:09,770
policies and then you take only the ones
 

2849
00:59:09,770 --> 00:59:11,710
policies and then you take only the ones
that are consistent with the human data

2850
00:59:11,710 --> 00:59:11,720
that are consistent with the human data
 

2851
00:59:11,720 --> 00:59:13,840
that are consistent with the human data
that you've observed that still needs a

2852
00:59:13,840 --> 00:59:13,850
that you've observed that still needs a
 

2853
00:59:13,850 --> 00:59:15,730
that you've observed that still needs a
lot of put a lot of things could happen

2854
00:59:15,730 --> 00:59:15,740
lot of put a lot of things could happen
 

2855
00:59:15,740 --> 00:59:17,710
lot of put a lot of things could happen
outside of that distribution where

2856
00:59:17,710 --> 00:59:17,720
outside of that distribution where
 

2857
00:59:17,720 --> 00:59:19,210
outside of that distribution where
you're confident then you know what's

2858
00:59:19,210 --> 00:59:19,220
you're confident then you know what's
 

2859
00:59:19,220 --> 00:59:22,090
you're confident then you know what's
going on by the way this should you have

2860
00:59:22,090 --> 00:59:22,100
going on by the way this should you have
 

2861
00:59:22,100 --> 00:59:24,220
going on by the way this should you have
gotten used to this terminology out of a

2862
00:59:24,220 --> 00:59:24,230
gotten used to this terminology out of a
 

2863
00:59:24,230 --> 00:59:26,860
gotten used to this terminology out of a
distribution within the system machine

2864
00:59:26,860 --> 00:59:26,870
distribution within the system machine
 

2865
00:59:26,870 --> 00:59:29,980
distribution within the system machine
learning terminology because it kind of

2866
00:59:29,980 --> 00:59:29,990
learning terminology because it kind of
 

2867
00:59:29,990 --> 00:59:33,300
learning terminology because it kind of
assumes so distribution is referring to

2868
00:59:33,300 --> 00:59:33,310
assumes so distribution is referring to
 

2869
00:59:33,310 --> 00:59:37,330
assumes so distribution is referring to
the the data that you States that you

2870
00:59:37,330 --> 00:59:37,340
the the data that you States that you
 

2871
00:59:37,340 --> 00:59:39,490
the the data that you States that you
encounter they've noticed so far at

2872
00:59:39,490 --> 00:59:39,500
encounter they've noticed so far at
 

2873
00:59:39,500 --> 00:59:41,440
encounter they've noticed so far at
training time yeah but it kind of also

2874
00:59:41,440 --> 00:59:41,450
training time yeah but it kind of also
 

2875
00:59:41,450 --> 00:59:44,430
training time yeah but it kind of also
implies that there's a nice like

2876
00:59:44,430 --> 00:59:44,440
implies that there's a nice like
 

2877
00:59:44,440 --> 00:59:46,810
implies that there's a nice like
statistical model that represents that

2878
00:59:46,810 --> 00:59:46,820
statistical model that represents that
 

2879
00:59:46,820 --> 00:59:49,450
statistical model that represents that
data so odd a distribution feels like I

2880
00:59:49,450 --> 00:59:49,460
data so odd a distribution feels like I
 

2881
00:59:49,460 --> 00:59:53,200
data so odd a distribution feels like I
don't know it it uh it raises to me

2882
00:59:53,200 --> 00:59:53,210
don't know it it uh it raises to me
 

2883
00:59:53,210 --> 00:59:55,770
don't know it it uh it raises to me
falafel questions of how we humans

2884
00:59:55,770 --> 00:59:55,780
falafel questions of how we humans
 

2885
00:59:55,780 --> 00:59:59,560
falafel questions of how we humans
reason out of distribution reasonable

2886
00:59:59,560 --> 00:59:59,570
reason out of distribution reasonable
 

2887
00:59:59,570 --> 01:00:02,020
reason out of distribution reasonable
things that are completely we haven't

2888
01:00:02,020 --> 01:00:02,030
things that are completely we haven't
 

2889
01:00:02,030 --> 01:00:04,180
things that are completely we haven't
seen before and so and what we're

2890
01:00:04,180 --> 01:00:04,190
seen before and so and what we're
 

2891
01:00:04,190 --> 01:00:06,910
seen before and so and what we're
talking about here is how do we reason

2892
01:00:06,910 --> 01:00:06,920
talking about here is how do we reason
 

2893
01:00:06,920 --> 01:00:09,490
talking about here is how do we reason
about what other people do in

2894
01:00:09,490 --> 01:00:09,500
about what other people do in
 

2895
01:00:09,500 --> 01:00:10,810
about what other people do in
you know situations where we haven't

2896
01:00:10,810 --> 01:00:10,820
you know situations where we haven't
 

2897
01:00:10,820 --> 01:00:13,240
you know situations where we haven't
seen them and somehow we just magically

2898
01:00:13,240 --> 01:00:13,250
seen them and somehow we just magically
 

2899
01:00:13,250 --> 01:00:15,250
seen them and somehow we just magically
navigate that right you know I can

2900
01:00:15,250 --> 01:00:15,260
navigate that right you know I can
 

2901
01:00:15,260 --> 01:00:17,290
navigate that right you know I can
anticipate what will happen in

2902
01:00:17,290 --> 01:00:17,300
anticipate what will happen in
 

2903
01:00:17,300 --> 01:00:20,710
anticipate what will happen in
situations that are even novel in many

2904
01:00:20,710 --> 01:00:20,720
situations that are even novel in many
 

2905
01:00:20,720 --> 01:00:22,840
situations that are even novel in many
ways and I have a pretty good intuition

2906
01:00:22,840 --> 01:00:22,850
ways and I have a pretty good intuition
 

2907
01:00:22,850 --> 01:00:24,430
ways and I have a pretty good intuition
for I always get it right but you know

2908
01:00:24,430 --> 01:00:24,440
for I always get it right but you know
 

2909
01:00:24,440 --> 01:00:25,930
for I always get it right but you know
and I might be a little uncertain and so

2910
01:00:25,930 --> 01:00:25,940
and I might be a little uncertain and so
 

2911
01:00:25,940 --> 01:00:29,740
and I might be a little uncertain and so
on I think it's it's this that if you

2912
01:00:29,740 --> 01:00:29,750
on I think it's it's this that if you
 

2913
01:00:29,750 --> 01:00:34,080
on I think it's it's this that if you
just rely on data you know you you just

2914
01:00:34,080 --> 01:00:34,090
just rely on data you know you you just
 

2915
01:00:34,090 --> 01:00:36,190
just rely on data you know you you just
too many possibilities or too many

2916
01:00:36,190 --> 01:00:36,200
too many possibilities or too many
 

2917
01:00:36,200 --> 01:00:38,020
too many possibilities or too many
policies out there that fit the data and

2918
01:00:38,020 --> 01:00:38,030
policies out there that fit the data and
 

2919
01:00:38,030 --> 01:00:39,370
policies out there that fit the data and
by the way it's not just state it's

2920
01:00:39,370 --> 01:00:39,380
by the way it's not just state it's
 

2921
01:00:39,380 --> 01:00:40,810
by the way it's not just state it's
clearly kind of history of stake has to

2922
01:00:40,810 --> 01:00:40,820
clearly kind of history of stake has to
 

2923
01:00:40,820 --> 01:00:41,980
clearly kind of history of stake has to
really be able to anticipate what the

2924
01:00:41,980 --> 01:00:41,990
really be able to anticipate what the
 

2925
01:00:41,990 --> 01:00:43,990
really be able to anticipate what the
person will do it kind of depends on

2926
01:00:43,990 --> 01:00:44,000
person will do it kind of depends on
 

2927
01:00:44,000 --> 01:00:45,310
person will do it kind of depends on
what they've been doing so far cuz

2928
01:00:45,310 --> 01:00:45,320
what they've been doing so far cuz
 

2929
01:00:45,320 --> 01:00:47,200
what they've been doing so far cuz
that's the information you need to kind

2930
01:00:47,200 --> 01:00:47,210
that's the information you need to kind
 

2931
01:00:47,210 --> 01:00:49,480
that's the information you need to kind
of at least implicitly sort of say oh

2932
01:00:49,480 --> 01:00:49,490
of at least implicitly sort of say oh
 

2933
01:00:49,490 --> 01:00:51,130
of at least implicitly sort of say oh
this is the kind of person that this is

2934
01:00:51,130 --> 01:00:51,140
this is the kind of person that this is
 

2935
01:00:51,140 --> 01:00:52,450
this is the kind of person that this is
this probably what they're trying to do

2936
01:00:52,450 --> 01:00:52,460
this probably what they're trying to do
 

2937
01:00:52,460 --> 01:00:54,130
this probably what they're trying to do
so anyway it's like you're trying to map

2938
01:00:54,130 --> 01:00:54,140
so anyway it's like you're trying to map
 

2939
01:00:54,140 --> 01:00:56,050
so anyway it's like you're trying to map
history States so actually there's many

2940
01:00:56,050 --> 01:00:56,060
history States so actually there's many
 

2941
01:00:56,060 --> 01:00:58,510
history States so actually there's many
mapping and history meaning like the

2942
01:00:58,510 --> 01:00:58,520
mapping and history meaning like the
 

2943
01:00:58,520 --> 01:01:01,780
mapping and history meaning like the
last yes word the last few minutes or

2944
01:01:01,780 --> 01:01:01,790
last yes word the last few minutes or
 

2945
01:01:01,790 --> 01:01:03,310
last yes word the last few minutes or
the last few months who knows who knows

2946
01:01:03,310 --> 01:01:03,320
the last few months who knows who knows
 

2947
01:01:03,320 --> 01:01:05,440
the last few months who knows who knows
how much you need right in terms of your

2948
01:01:05,440 --> 01:01:05,450
how much you need right in terms of your
 

2949
01:01:05,450 --> 01:01:07,360
how much you need right in terms of your
state is really like the positions of

2950
01:01:07,360 --> 01:01:07,370
state is really like the positions of
 

2951
01:01:07,370 --> 01:01:09,790
state is really like the positions of
everything or whatnot and velocities who

2952
01:01:09,790 --> 01:01:09,800
everything or whatnot and velocities who
 

2953
01:01:09,800 --> 01:01:11,110
everything or whatnot and velocities who
knows how much you need and then and

2954
01:01:11,110 --> 01:01:11,120
knows how much you need and then and
 

2955
01:01:11,120 --> 01:01:13,900
knows how much you need and then and
then there's this there's so many

2956
01:01:13,900 --> 01:01:13,910
then there's this there's so many
 

2957
01:01:13,910 --> 01:01:16,090
then there's this there's so many
mappings and so now you're talking about

2958
01:01:16,090 --> 01:01:16,100
mappings and so now you're talking about
 

2959
01:01:16,100 --> 01:01:18,070
mappings and so now you're talking about
how do you regularize that space what

2960
01:01:18,070 --> 01:01:18,080
how do you regularize that space what
 

2961
01:01:18,080 --> 01:01:20,620
how do you regularize that space what
priors do you impose or what's the

2962
01:01:20,620 --> 01:01:20,630
priors do you impose or what's the
 

2963
01:01:20,630 --> 01:01:22,540
priors do you impose or what's the
inductive bias so you know there's all

2964
01:01:22,540 --> 01:01:22,550
inductive bias so you know there's all
 

2965
01:01:22,550 --> 01:01:25,320
inductive bias so you know there's all
very related things to think about it on

2966
01:01:25,320 --> 01:01:25,330
very related things to think about it on
 

2967
01:01:25,330 --> 01:01:27,520
very related things to think about it on
basically water assumptions that we

2968
01:01:27,520 --> 01:01:27,530
basically water assumptions that we
 

2969
01:01:27,530 --> 01:01:31,450
basically water assumptions that we
should be making such that these models

2970
01:01:31,450 --> 01:01:31,460
should be making such that these models
 

2971
01:01:31,460 --> 01:01:33,430
should be making such that these models
actually generalize outside of the data

2972
01:01:33,430 --> 01:01:33,440
actually generalize outside of the data
 

2973
01:01:33,440 --> 01:01:36,340
actually generalize outside of the data
that we've seen and now you're talking

2974
01:01:36,340 --> 01:01:36,350
that we've seen and now you're talking
 

2975
01:01:36,350 --> 01:01:38,230
that we've seen and now you're talking
about well I don't know what can you

2976
01:01:38,230 --> 01:01:38,240
about well I don't know what can you
 

2977
01:01:38,240 --> 01:01:39,880
about well I don't know what can you
assume maybe you can assume that people

2978
01:01:39,880 --> 01:01:39,890
assume maybe you can assume that people
 

2979
01:01:39,890 --> 01:01:42,520
assume maybe you can assume that people
like actually have intentions and that's

2980
01:01:42,520 --> 01:01:42,530
like actually have intentions and that's
 

2981
01:01:42,530 --> 01:01:44,530
like actually have intentions and that's
what drives their actions maybe that's

2982
01:01:44,530 --> 01:01:44,540
what drives their actions maybe that's
 

2983
01:01:44,540 --> 01:01:46,930
what drives their actions maybe that's
you know the right thing to do when you

2984
01:01:46,930 --> 01:01:46,940
you know the right thing to do when you
 

2985
01:01:46,940 --> 01:01:49,990
you know the right thing to do when you
haven't seen data very nearby that tells

2986
01:01:49,990 --> 01:01:50,000
haven't seen data very nearby that tells
 

2987
01:01:50,000 --> 01:01:52,180
haven't seen data very nearby that tells
you otherwise I don't know it's a very

2988
01:01:52,180 --> 01:01:52,190
you otherwise I don't know it's a very
 

2989
01:01:52,190 --> 01:01:55,000
you otherwise I don't know it's a very
open question do you think so that one

2990
01:01:55,000 --> 01:01:55,010
open question do you think so that one
 

2991
01:01:55,010 --> 01:01:56,200
open question do you think so that one
of the dreams of artificial intelligence

2992
01:01:56,200 --> 01:01:56,210
of the dreams of artificial intelligence
 

2993
01:01:56,210 --> 01:01:59,040
of the dreams of artificial intelligence
was to solve common sense reasoning

2994
01:01:59,040 --> 01:01:59,050
was to solve common sense reasoning
 

2995
01:01:59,050 --> 01:02:02,950
was to solve common sense reasoning
whatever the heck that means do you

2996
01:02:02,950 --> 01:02:02,960
whatever the heck that means do you
 

2997
01:02:02,960 --> 01:02:04,510
whatever the heck that means do you
think something like common sense

2998
01:02:04,510 --> 01:02:04,520
think something like common sense
 

2999
01:02:04,520 --> 01:02:06,940
think something like common sense
reasoning has to be solved in part to be

01:02:06,940 --> 01:02:06,950
reasoning has to be solved in part to be
 

3001
01:02:06,950 --> 01:02:09,660
reasoning has to be solved in part to be
able to solve this dance of human

01:02:09,660 --> 01:02:09,670
able to solve this dance of human

01:02:13,250 --> 01:02:15,340

robot interaction in general you have to

3006
01:02:15,340 --> 01:02:15,350
robot interaction in general you have to
 

3007
01:02:15,350 --> 01:02:17,160
robot interaction in general you have to
be able to reason about these kinds of

3008
01:02:17,160 --> 01:02:17,170
be able to reason about these kinds of
 

3009
01:02:17,170 --> 01:02:24,120
be able to reason about these kinds of
common-sense concepts of physics of

3010
01:02:24,120 --> 01:02:24,130

 

3011
01:02:24,130 --> 01:02:27,010

you know all the things we've been

3012
01:02:27,010 --> 01:02:27,020
you know all the things we've been
 

3013
01:02:27,020 --> 01:02:28,630
you know all the things we've been
talking about humans I don't even know

3014
01:02:28,630 --> 01:02:28,640
talking about humans I don't even know
 

3015
01:02:28,640 --> 01:02:30,849
talking about humans I don't even know
how to express them with words but the

3016
01:02:30,849 --> 01:02:30,859
how to express them with words but the
 

3017
01:02:30,859 --> 01:02:33,970
how to express them with words but the
bay the basics of human behavior a fear

3018
01:02:33,970 --> 01:02:33,980
bay the basics of human behavior a fear
 

3019
01:02:33,980 --> 01:02:36,339
bay the basics of human behavior a fear
of death so like to me it's really

3020
01:02:36,339 --> 01:02:36,349
of death so like to me it's really
 

3021
01:02:36,349 --> 01:02:38,740
of death so like to me it's really
important to encode in some kind of

3022
01:02:38,740 --> 01:02:38,750
important to encode in some kind of
 

3023
01:02:38,750 --> 01:02:41,980
important to encode in some kind of
sense maybe not maybe it's implicit but

3024
01:02:41,980 --> 01:02:41,990
sense maybe not maybe it's implicit but
 

3025
01:02:41,990 --> 01:02:43,630
sense maybe not maybe it's implicit but
it feels that it's important to

3026
01:02:43,630 --> 01:02:43,640
it feels that it's important to
 

3027
01:02:43,640 --> 01:02:45,640
it feels that it's important to
explicitly encode the fear of death

3028
01:02:45,640 --> 01:02:45,650
explicitly encode the fear of death
 

3029
01:02:45,650 --> 01:02:51,940
explicitly encode the fear of death
that people don't want to die because it

3030
01:02:51,940 --> 01:02:51,950
that people don't want to die because it
 

3031
01:02:51,950 --> 01:02:55,270
that people don't want to die because it
seems silly but like that that the game

3032
01:02:55,270 --> 01:02:55,280
seems silly but like that that the game
 

3033
01:02:55,280 --> 01:02:57,640
seems silly but like that that the game
of chicken that involves with the

3034
01:02:57,640 --> 01:02:57,650
of chicken that involves with the
 

3035

pedestrian crossing the street is

3036
01:02:59,400 --> 01:02:59,410
pedestrian crossing the street is
 

3037
01:02:59,410 --> 01:03:03,070
pedestrian crossing the street is
playing with the idea of mortality like

3038
01:03:03,070 --> 01:03:03,080
playing with the idea of mortality like
 

3039
01:03:03,080 --> 01:03:04,599
playing with the idea of mortality like
we really don't want to dies that's just

3040
01:03:04,599 --> 01:03:04,609
we really don't want to dies that's just
 

3041
01:03:04,609 --> 01:03:08,260
we really don't want to dies that's just
like a negative reward I don't know I it

3042
01:03:08,260 --> 01:03:08,270
like a negative reward I don't know I it
 

3043
01:03:08,270 --> 01:03:10,000
like a negative reward I don't know I it
just feels like all these human concepts

3044
01:03:10,000 --> 01:03:10,010
just feels like all these human concepts
 

3045
01:03:10,010 --> 01:03:12,790
just feels like all these human concepts
have to be encoded did you share that

3046
01:03:12,790 --> 01:03:12,800
have to be encoded did you share that
 

3047
01:03:12,800 --> 01:03:14,530
have to be encoded did you share that
sense or is just a lot simpler that I'm

3048
01:03:14,530 --> 01:03:14,540
sense or is just a lot simpler that I'm
 

3049
01:03:14,540 --> 01:03:16,390
sense or is just a lot simpler that I'm
making out to be I think it might be

3050
01:03:16,390 --> 01:03:16,400
making out to be I think it might be
 

3051
01:03:16,400 --> 01:03:17,859
making out to be I think it might be
simpler and I'm the first thing who

3052
01:03:17,859 --> 01:03:17,869
simpler and I'm the first thing who
 

3053
01:03:17,869 --> 01:03:19,329
simpler and I'm the first thing who
likes to complicate is I think where we

3054
01:03:19,329 --> 01:03:19,339
likes to complicate is I think where we
 

3055
01:03:19,339 --> 01:03:22,630
likes to complicate is I think where we
simpler than that um because it turns

3056
01:03:22,630 --> 01:03:22,640
simpler than that um because it turns
 

3057
01:03:22,640 --> 01:03:27,070
simpler than that um because it turns
out for instance if you if you say model

people in the very I don't call it
traditional why I don't know if it's

3062
01:03:31,420 --> 01:03:31,430
traditional why I don't know if it's
 

3063
01:03:31,430 --> 01:03:33,040
traditional why I don't know if it's
fair to look at it as a traditional way

3064
01:03:33,040 --> 01:03:33,050
fair to look at it as a traditional way
 

3065
01:03:33,050 --> 01:03:35,620
fair to look at it as a traditional way
but but you know calling people as okay

3066
01:03:35,620 --> 01:03:35,630
but but you know calling people as okay
 

3067
01:03:35,630 --> 01:03:37,990
but but you know calling people as okay
they're irrational somehow the

01:03:37,990 --> 01:03:38,000
they're irrational somehow the
 

3069
01:03:38,000 --> 01:03:43,109
they're irrational somehow the
utilitarian perspective well in that

3070
01:03:43,109 --> 01:03:43,119
utilitarian perspective well in that
 

3071
01:03:43,119 --> 01:03:47,109
utilitarian perspective well in that
once you say that they you automatically

01:03:47,119 --> 01:03:48,910
once you say that they you automatically

so when when you're sort of cheating

3082
01:04:04,530 --> 01:04:04,540
so when when you're sort of cheating

incentives humans or artificial you're
 

3087
01:04:13,070 --> 01:04:15,310

kind of implicitly modeling that they'd

01:04:15,310 --> 01:04:15,320
kind of implicitly modeling that they'd

like to stick around so that they can
 

3091
01:04:17,570 --> 01:04:21,099
like to stick around so that they can
accomplish those goals um so I think I

3092
01:04:21,099 --> 01:04:21,109
accomplish those goals um so I think I
 

3093
01:04:21,109 --> 01:04:23,650
accomplish those goals um so I think I
think in a sense maybe that's what draws

think in a sense maybe that's what draws
 

3095
01:04:23,660 --> 01:04:25,420
think in a sense maybe that's what draws

even though it's so broken we've been

even though it's so broken we've been

01:04:31,300 --> 01:04:31,310
perspective and like we were talking
 

3103
01:04:31,310 --> 01:04:32,920
perspective and like we were talking
about earlier what's the alternative I

3104
01:04:32,920 --> 01:04:32,930
about earlier what's the alternative I

about earlier what's the alternative I
give up and go home or you know I just

don't know

01:04:37,940 --> 01:04:40,930
what to assume out of distribution that
come back to this um it's just it's been

3114
01:04:40,930 --> 01:04:40,940
come back to this um it's just it's been
 

3115
01:04:40,940 --> 01:04:43,359
come back to this um it's just it's been
a very fruitful way to think about the

3116
01:04:43,359 --> 01:04:43,369
a very fruitful way to think about the
 

3117
01:04:43,369 --> 01:04:46,240
a very fruitful way to think about the
problem and a very more positive way

3118
01:04:46,240 --> 01:04:46,250
problem and a very more positive way
 

3119
01:04:46,250 --> 01:04:48,300
problem and a very more positive way
right these people aren't just crazy

3120
01:04:48,300 --> 01:04:48,310
right these people aren't just crazy
 

3121
01:04:48,310 --> 01:04:50,710
right these people aren't just crazy
maybe they make more sense than we think

3122
01:04:50,710 --> 01:04:50,720
maybe they make more sense than we think
 

3123
01:04:50,720 --> 01:04:54,130
maybe they make more sense than we think
but um but I think we also have to

3124
01:04:54,130 --> 01:04:54,140
but um but I think we also have to
 

3125
01:04:54,140 --> 01:04:56,710
but um but I think we also have to
somehow be ready for it to be to be

01:04:56,710 --> 01:04:56,720
somehow be ready for it to be to be

not me it seems like some of these

01:06:23,200 --> 01:06:23,210
underlying assumption that if so I'm a

driver and I'm now really not driving

but supervising and my job is to

01:06:27,280 --> 01:06:27,290
but supervising and my job is to
 

3189
01:06:27,290 --> 01:06:30,040
but supervising and my job is to
intervene right and so we have to be

01:06:30,040 --> 01:06:30,050
intervene right and so we have to be
 

3191
01:06:30,050 --> 01:06:32,800
intervene right and so we have to be

01:06:32,800 --> 01:06:32,810
careful with this assumption that when
 

3193
01:06:32,810 --> 01:06:39,190
careful with this assumption that when
I'm if I'm supervising I will be just as

3194
01:06:39,190 --> 01:06:39,200
I'm if I'm supervising I will be just as
 

3195
01:06:39,200 --> 01:06:42,160
I'm if I'm supervising I will be just as
safe as when I'm driving like that I

3196
01:06:42,160 --> 01:06:42,170
safe as when I'm driving like that I
 

3197
01:06:42,170 --> 01:06:44,530
safe as when I'm driving like that I
will you know if I if I wouldn't get

3198
01:06:44,530 --> 01:06:44,540
will you know if I if I wouldn't get
 

3199
01:06:44,540 --> 01:06:47,200
will you know if I if I wouldn't get
into some kind of accident if I'm

3200
01:06:47,200 --> 01:06:47,210
into some kind of accident if I'm
 

3201
01:06:47,210 --> 01:06:49,630
into some kind of accident if I'm
driving I will be able to avoid that

3202
01:06:49,630 --> 01:06:49,640

01:06:49,640 --> 01:06:50,400

axis
 

3205
01:06:50,410 --> 01:06:52,440
axis
and when I'm supervising to and I think

3206
01:06:52,440 --> 01:06:52,450
and when I'm supervising to and I think
 

3207
01:06:52,450 --> 01:06:55,260
and when I'm supervising to and I think
I'm concerned about this assumption from

3208
01:06:55,260 --> 01:06:55,270
I'm concerned about this assumption from
 

3209
01:06:55,270 --> 01:06:57,569
I'm concerned about this assumption from
a few perspectives so from a technical

3210
01:06:57,569 --> 01:06:57,579
a few perspectives so from a technical
 

3211
01:06:57,579 --> 01:06:59,789
a few perspectives so from a technical
perspective it's that when you'll add

3212
01:06:59,789 --> 01:06:59,799
perspective it's that when you'll add
 

3213
01:06:59,799 --> 01:07:01,589
perspective it's that when you'll add
something kind of take control and do

3214
01:07:01,589 --> 01:07:01,599
something kind of take control and do
 

3215
01:07:01,599 --> 01:07:02,910
something kind of take control and do
its thing and it depends on what that

3216
01:07:02,910 --> 01:07:02,920
its thing and it depends on what that
 

3217
01:07:02,920 --> 01:07:04,950
its thing and it depends on what that
thing is obviously and how much is

3218
01:07:04,950 --> 01:07:04,960
thing is obviously and how much is
 

3219
01:07:04,960 --> 01:07:06,630
thing is obviously and how much is
taking on how what things are you

3220
01:07:06,630 --> 01:07:06,640
taking on how what things are you
 

3221
01:07:06,640 --> 01:07:09,270
taking on how what things are you
trusting it to do but if you let it do

3222
01:07:09,270 --> 01:07:09,280
trusting it to do but if you let it do
 

3223
01:07:09,280 --> 01:07:12,539
trusting it to do but if you let it do
its thing and take control it will go to

3224
01:07:12,539 --> 01:07:12,549
its thing and take control it will go to
 

3225
01:07:12,549 --> 01:07:15,240
its thing and take control it will go to

they function in the states that they

questionable now another part is the
 

3243
01:07:32,589 --> 01:07:34,589
questionable now another part is the
kind of the human factor side of this

3244
01:07:34,589 --> 01:07:34,599
kind of the human factor side of this
 

3245
01:07:34,599 --> 01:07:38,430
kind of the human factor side of this
which is that I don't know about you but

3246
01:07:38,430 --> 01:07:38,440
which is that I don't know about you but
 

3247
01:07:38,440 --> 01:07:41,099
which is that I don't know about you but
I think I definitely feel like I'm

learn this thing better than when
 

3269
01:08:01,210 --> 01:08:02,849
learn this thing better than when
they're passively told the answer I

3270
01:08:02,849 --> 01:08:02,859
they're passively told the answer I
 

3271
01:08:02,859 --> 01:08:04,500
they're passively told the answer I
think that's some more related and I

3272
01:08:04,500 --> 01:08:04,510
think that's some more related and I
 

3273
01:08:04,510 --> 01:08:06,180
think that's some more related and I
think people have studied this in human

3274
01:08:06,180 --> 01:08:06,190
think people have studied this in human
 

3275
01:08:06,190 --> 01:08:08,160
think people have studied this in human
factors for airplanes and I think it's

3276
01:08:08,160 --> 01:08:08,170
factors for airplanes and I think it's
 

3277
01:08:08,170 --> 01:08:10,319
factors for airplanes and I think it's
actually fairly established that these

3278
01:08:10,319 --> 01:08:10,329
actually fairly established that these
 

3279
01:08:10,329 --> 01:08:13,589
actually fairly established that these
two are not the same so I and that point

3280
01:08:13,589 --> 01:08:13,599
two are not the same so I and that point
 

3281
01:08:13,599 --> 01:08:14,940
two are not the same so I and that point
because I've gotten a huge amount of

3282
01:08:14,940 --> 01:08:14,950
because I've gotten a huge amount of
 

3283
01:08:14,950 --> 01:08:17,959
because I've gotten a huge amount of
heat on this and I stand by it okay

3284
01:08:17,959 --> 01:08:17,969
heat on this and I stand by it okay
 

3285
01:08:17,969 --> 01:08:19,979
heat on this and I stand by it okay
because I know the human factors

3286
01:08:19,979 --> 01:08:19,989
because I know the human factors
 

3287
01:08:19,989 --> 01:08:22,919
because I know the human factors
community well and the work here is

3288
01:08:22,919 --> 01:08:22,929
community well and the work here is
 

3289
01:08:22,929 --> 01:08:25,680
community well and the work here is
really strong and there's many decades

3290
01:08:25,680 --> 01:08:25,690
really strong and there's many decades
 

3291
01:08:25,690 --> 01:08:27,780
really strong and there's many decades
of work show exactly what you're saying

3292
01:08:27,780 --> 01:08:27,790
of work show exactly what you're saying
 

3293
01:08:27,790 --> 01:08:30,120
of work show exactly what you're saying
nevertheless I've been continuously

3294
01:08:30,120 --> 01:08:30,130
nevertheless I've been continuously
 

3295
01:08:30,130 --> 01:08:32,309
nevertheless I've been continuously
surprised that much of the predictions

3296
01:08:32,309 --> 01:08:32,319
surprised that much of the predictions
 

3297
01:08:32,319 --> 01:08:33,990
surprised that much of the predictions
of that work has been wrong and what

3298
01:08:33,990 --> 01:08:34,000
of that work has been wrong and what
 

3299
01:08:34,000 --> 01:08:38,249
of that work has been wrong and what
I've seen so what we have to do I still

3300
01:08:38,249 --> 01:08:38,259
I've seen so what we have to do I still
 

3301
01:08:38,259 --> 01:08:40,499
I've seen so what we have to do I still
agree with everything you said but we

3302
01:08:40,499 --> 01:08:40,509
agree with everything you said but we
 

3303
01:08:40,509 --> 01:08:44,809
agree with everything you said but we
have to be a little bit more open-minded

3304
01:08:44,809 --> 01:08:44,819
have to be a little bit more open-minded
 

3305
01:08:44,819 --> 01:08:48,570
have to be a little bit more open-minded
so the the I'll tell you there's a few

3306
01:08:48,570 --> 01:08:48,580
so the the I'll tell you there's a few
 

3307
01:08:48,580 --> 01:08:51,240
so the the I'll tell you there's a few
surprising things that super villi kever

3308
01:08:51,240 --> 01:08:51,250
surprising things that super villi kever
 

3309
01:08:51,250 --> 01:08:53,130
surprising things that super villi kever
ething you said to the word is actually

3310
01:08:53,130 --> 01:08:53,140
ething you said to the word is actually
 

3311
01:08:53,140 --> 01:08:56,760
ething you said to the word is actually
exactly correct but it doesn't say what

3312
01:08:56,760 --> 01:08:56,770
exactly correct but it doesn't say what
 

3313
01:08:56,770 --> 01:08:59,519
exactly correct but it doesn't say what
you didn't say is that these systems are

3314
01:08:59,519 --> 01:08:59,529
you didn't say is that these systems are
 

3315
01:08:59,529 --> 01:09:01,530
you didn't say is that these systems are
you said you can't assume a bunch of

you said you can't assume a bunch of
 

3317
01:09:01,540 --> 01:09:04,349
you said you can't assume a bunch of
things but we don't know if he says

3318
01:09:04,349 --> 01:09:04,359
things but we don't know if he says
 

3319
01:09:04,359 --> 01:09:07,200
things but we don't know if he says
are fundamentally unsafe that's still

3320
01:09:07,200 --> 01:09:07,210
are fundamentally unsafe that's still
 

3321
01:09:07,210 --> 01:09:09,870

interesting things like I'm surprised by

3324
01:09:13,709 --> 01:09:13,719
interesting things like I'm surprised by
 

3325
01:09:13,719 --> 01:09:16,890
interesting things like I'm surprised by
the fact not the fact that what seems to

the fact not the fact that what seems to
 

3327
01:09:16,900 --> 01:09:19,800
the fact not the fact that what seems to
be anecdotally from well from large data

collection that we've done but also from
 

3331
01:09:21,759 --> 01:09:24,359

just talking to a lot of people when in

3332
01:09:24,359 --> 01:09:24,369
just talking to a lot of people when in
 

3333

just talking to a lot of people when in
the supervisory role of semi autonomous

3334
01:09:26,280 --> 01:09:26,290
the supervisory role of semi autonomous
 

3335
01:09:26,290 --> 01:09:29,099
the supervisory role of semi autonomous
systems that are sufficiently dumb at

3336
01:09:29,099 --> 01:09:29,109
systems that are sufficiently dumb at
 

3337
01:09:29,109 --> 01:09:32,669
systems that are sufficiently dumb at
least which is that might be a key

3338
01:09:32,669 --> 01:09:32,679
least which is that might be a key
 

3339
01:09:32,679 --> 01:09:34,769
least which is that might be a key
element is the systems not to be dumb

3340
01:09:34,769 --> 01:09:34,779
element is the systems not to be dumb
 

3341
01:09:34,779 --> 01:09:37,800
element is the systems not to be dumb
the people are actually more energized

3342
01:09:37,800 --> 01:09:37,810
the people are actually more energized
 

3343
01:09:37,810 --> 01:09:40,010
the people are actually more energized
as observer so they're actually better

3344
01:09:40,010 --> 01:09:40,020
as observer so they're actually better
 

3345
01:09:40,020 --> 01:09:42,300
as observer so they're actually better
they're they're better at observing the

3346
01:09:42,300 --> 01:09:42,310
they're they're better at observing the
 

3347
01:09:42,310 --> 01:09:45,450
they're they're better at observing the
situation so there might be cases in

3348
01:09:45,450 --> 01:09:45,460
situation so there might be cases in
 

3349
01:09:45,460 --> 01:09:47,849
situation so there might be cases in
systems if you get the interaction right

3350
01:09:47,849 --> 01:09:47,859
systems if you get the interaction right
 

3351
01:09:47,859 --> 01:09:51,510
systems if you get the interaction right
or you as a supervisor will do a better

3352
01:09:51,510 --> 01:09:51,520
or you as a supervisor will do a better
 

3353
01:09:51,520 --> 01:09:54,149
or you as a supervisor will do a better
job with the system together I agree I

3354
01:09:54,149 --> 01:09:54,159
job with the system together I agree I
 

3355
01:09:54,159 --> 01:09:56,729
job with the system together I agree I
think that is actually really possible

3356
01:09:56,729 --> 01:09:56,739
think that is actually really possible
 

3357
01:09:56,739 --> 01:09:58,169
think that is actually really possible
I guess mainly I'm pointing out that if

3358
01:09:58,169 --> 01:09:58,179
I guess mainly I'm pointing out that if
 

3359
01:09:58,179 --> 01:10:01,200
I guess mainly I'm pointing out that if
you do it naively you're implicitly

3360
01:10:01,200 --> 01:10:01,210
you do it naively you're implicitly
 

3361
01:10:01,210 --> 01:10:02,790
you do it naively you're implicitly
assuming something that assumption might

3362
01:10:02,790 --> 01:10:02,800
assuming something that assumption might
 

3363
01:10:02,800 --> 01:10:05,160
assuming something that assumption might
actually really be wrong but I do think

3364
01:10:05,160 --> 01:10:05,170
actually really be wrong but I do think
 

3365
01:10:05,170 --> 01:10:09,570
actually really be wrong but I do think
that if you explicitly think about what

3366
01:10:09,570 --> 01:10:09,580
that if you explicitly think about what
 

3367
01:10:09,580 --> 01:10:11,640
that if you explicitly think about what
the agent reducers that the person still

3368
01:10:11,640 --> 01:10:11,650
the agent reducers that the person still
 

3369
01:10:11,650 --> 01:10:15,180
the agent reducers that the person still
stays engaged what the so that you

3370
01:10:15,180 --> 01:10:15,190
stays engaged what the so that you
 

3371
01:10:15,190 --> 01:10:16,859
stays engaged what the so that you
essentially empower the person do more

3372
01:10:16,859 --> 01:10:16,869
essentially empower the person do more
 

3373
01:10:16,869 --> 01:10:18,330
essentially empower the person do more
than they could that's the really the

3374
01:10:18,330 --> 01:10:18,340
than they could that's the really the
 

3375
01:10:18,340 --> 01:10:20,370
than they could that's the really the
goal right is you still have a driver so

3376
01:10:20,370 --> 01:10:20,380
goal right is you still have a driver so
 

3377
01:10:20,380 --> 01:10:24,930
goal right is you still have a driver so
you want to empower them to be so much

3378
01:10:24,930 --> 01:10:24,940
you want to empower them to be so much
 

3379
01:10:24,940 --> 01:10:26,520
you want to empower them to be so much
better than they would be by themselves

3380
01:10:26,520 --> 01:10:26,530
better than they would be by themselves
 

3381
01:10:26,530 --> 01:10:28,770
better than they would be by themselves
and that's different it's a very

3382
01:10:28,770 --> 01:10:28,780
and that's different it's a very
 

3383
01:10:28,780 --> 01:10:31,050
and that's different it's a very
different mindset then I want them to

3384
01:10:31,050 --> 01:10:31,060
different mindset then I want them to
 

3385
01:10:31,060 --> 01:10:38,399
different mindset then I want them to
basically not join but be ready to sort

3386
01:10:38,399 --> 01:10:38,409
basically not join but be ready to sort
 

3387
01:10:38,409 --> 01:10:41,399
basically not join but be ready to sort
of take over so one of the interesting

3388
01:10:41,399 --> 01:10:41,409
of take over so one of the interesting
 

3389
01:10:41,409 --> 01:10:42,660
of take over so one of the interesting
things we'll be talking about is the

3390
01:10:42,660 --> 01:10:42,670
things we'll be talking about is the
 

3391
01:10:42,670 --> 01:10:46,500
things we'll be talking about is the
rewards that they seem to be fundamental

3392
01:10:46,500 --> 01:10:46,510
rewards that they seem to be fundamental
 

3393
01:10:46,510 --> 01:10:50,850
rewards that they seem to be fundamental
to the way robots behaves so broadly

3394
01:10:50,850 --> 01:10:50,860
to the way robots behaves so broadly
 

3395
01:10:50,860 --> 01:10:53,160
to the way robots behaves so broadly
speaking we've been talking about

3396
01:10:53,160 --> 01:10:53,170
speaking we've been talking about
 

3397
01:10:53,170 --> 01:10:55,709
speaking we've been talking about
utility function saw but you comment on

3398
01:10:55,709 --> 01:10:55,719
utility function saw but you comment on
 

3399
01:10:55,719 --> 01:10:58,950
utility function saw but you comment on
how do we approach the design of reward

3400
01:10:58,950 --> 01:10:58,960
how do we approach the design of reward
 

3401
01:10:58,960 --> 01:11:00,720
how do we approach the design of reward
functions like how do we come up with

3402
01:11:00,720 --> 01:11:00,730
functions like how do we come up with
 

3403
01:11:00,730 --> 01:11:02,700
functions like how do we come up with
good reward function

3404
01:11:02,700 --> 01:11:02,710
good reward function
 

3405
01:11:02,710 --> 01:11:10,060
good reward function
[Laughter]

3406
01:11:10,060 --> 01:11:10,070

 

3407
01:11:10,070 --> 01:11:14,500

this is you know I used to think I think

3408
01:11:14,500 --> 01:11:14,510
this is you know I used to think I think
 

3409
01:11:14,510 --> 01:11:17,470
this is you know I used to think I think
about how well it's actually really hard

3410
01:11:17,470 --> 01:11:17,480
about how well it's actually really hard
 

3411
01:11:17,480 --> 01:11:20,410
about how well it's actually really hard
to specify rewards for interaction

3412
01:11:20,410 --> 01:11:20,420
to specify rewards for interaction
 

3413
01:11:20,420 --> 01:11:22,930
to specify rewards for interaction
because and it's really supposed to be

3414
01:11:22,930 --> 01:11:22,940
because and it's really supposed to be
 

3415
01:11:22,940 --> 01:11:24,790
because and it's really supposed to be
what the people want and then you really

3416
01:11:24,790 --> 01:11:24,800
what the people want and then you really
 

3417
01:11:24,800 --> 01:11:25,840
what the people want and then you really
you know we talked about how you have to

3418
01:11:25,840 --> 01:11:25,850
you know we talked about how you have to
 

3419
01:11:25,850 --> 01:11:29,710
you know we talked about how you have to
customize what you want to do to the end

3420
01:11:29,710 --> 01:11:29,720
customize what you want to do to the end
 

3421
01:11:29,720 --> 01:11:35,500
customize what you want to do to the end
user but I kind of realized that even if

you take the interactive component away

3424
01:11:38,310 --> 01:11:38,320
you take the interactive component away
 

3425
01:11:38,320 --> 01:11:41,470
you take the interactive component away
it's still really hard to design reward

3426
01:11:41,470 --> 01:11:41,480
it's still really hard to design reward
 

3427
01:11:41,480 --> 01:11:43,840
it's still really hard to design reward
functions so what do I mean by that I

mean if we assumed this survey I

situation it optimizes but you have to
 

3511
01:13:32,329 --> 01:13:35,279
situation it optimizes but you have to
spend still a lot of time and actually

spend still a lot of time and actually

spend still a lot of time and actually

3515
01:13:38,059 --> 01:13:39,879
defining what it is that that criterion
should be make sure you didn't forget

01:13:39,879 --> 01:13:39,889
should be make sure you didn't forget
 

3517
01:13:39,889 --> 01:13:41,560
should be make sure you didn't forget
about 50 bazillion things that are

01:13:41,560 --> 01:13:41,570
about 50 bazillion things that are

01:13:41,570 --> 01:13:43,149
about 50 bazillion things that are
important and how they all should be

01:13:43,149 --> 01:13:43,159
important and how they all should be

what's good and when it's bad and how

3524
01:13:47,020 --> 01:13:47,030
what's good and when it's bad and how
 

3525
01:13:47,030 --> 01:13:50,859
what's good and when it's bad and how
good and how bad and so I think this is

3526
01:13:50,859 --> 01:13:50,869
good and how bad and so I think this is
 

3527
01:13:50,869 --> 01:13:55,569
good and how bad and so I think this is
this is a lesson that I don't know kind

3528
01:13:55,569 --> 01:13:55,579
this is a lesson that I don't know kind
 

3529
01:13:55,579 --> 01:13:58,839
this is a lesson that I don't know kind
of I guess I close my eyes to it for a

3530
01:13:58,839 --> 01:13:58,849
of I guess I close my eyes to it for a
 

3531
01:13:58,849 --> 01:14:00,700
of I guess I close my eyes to it for a
while cuz I've been you know tuning cost

3532
01:14:00,700 --> 01:14:00,710
while cuz I've been you know tuning cost
 

3533
01:14:00,710 --> 01:14:04,390
while cuz I've been you know tuning cost
functions for 10 years now but it it's

3534
01:14:04,390 --> 01:14:04,400
functions for 10 years now but it it's
 

3535
01:14:04,400 --> 01:14:07,450
functions for 10 years now but it it's
it really strikes me that yeah we've

3536
01:14:07,450 --> 01:14:07,460
it really strikes me that yeah we've
 

3537
01:14:07,460 --> 01:14:11,259
it really strikes me that yeah we've
moved the tuning and like designing of

3538
01:14:11,259 --> 01:14:11,269
moved the tuning and like designing of
 

3539
01:14:11,269 --> 01:14:16,930
moved the tuning and like designing of
features or whatever from the behavior

3540
01:14:16,930 --> 01:14:16,940
features or whatever from the behavior
 

3541
01:14:16,940 --> 01:14:20,229
features or whatever from the behavior
side into the reward side and yes I

3542
01:14:20,229 --> 01:14:20,239
side into the reward side and yes I
 

3543
01:14:20,239 --> 01:14:22,299
side into the reward side and yes I
agree that there's way less of it but it

3544
01:14:22,299 --> 01:14:22,309
agree that there's way less of it but it
 

3545
01:14:22,309 --> 01:14:24,339
agree that there's way less of it but it
still seems really hard to anticipate

3546
01:14:24,339 --> 01:14:24,349
still seems really hard to anticipate
 

3547
01:14:24,349 --> 01:14:27,640
still seems really hard to anticipate
any possible situation and make sure you

3548
01:14:27,640 --> 01:14:27,650
any possible situation and make sure you
 

3549
01:14:27,650 --> 01:14:30,549
any possible situation and make sure you
specify a reward function that when

3550
01:14:30,549 --> 01:14:30,559
specify a reward function that when
 

3551
01:14:30,559 --> 01:14:33,459
specify a reward function that when
optimized will work well in every

3552
01:14:33,459 --> 01:14:33,469
optimized will work well in every
 

3553
01:14:33,469 --> 01:14:36,819
optimized will work well in every
possible situation so so you're kind of

3554
01:14:36,819 --> 01:14:36,829
possible situation so so you're kind of
 

3555
01:14:36,829 --> 01:14:38,649
possible situation so so you're kind of
referring to unintended consequences or

3556
01:14:38,649 --> 01:14:38,659
referring to unintended consequences or
 

3557
01:14:38,659 --> 01:14:41,350
referring to unintended consequences or
just in general any kind of suboptimal

3558
01:14:41,350 --> 01:14:41,360
just in general any kind of suboptimal
 

3559
01:14:41,360 --> 01:14:43,569
just in general any kind of suboptimal
behavior that emerges outside of the

3560
01:14:43,569 --> 01:14:43,579
behavior that emerges outside of the
 

3561
01:14:43,579 --> 01:14:44,950
behavior that emerges outside of the
things you said about out of

3562
01:14:44,950 --> 01:14:44,960
things you said about out of
 

3563
01:14:44,960 --> 01:14:48,160
things you said about out of
distribution suboptimal behavior that is

3564
01:14:48,160 --> 01:14:48,170
distribution suboptimal behavior that is
 

3565
01:14:48,170 --> 01:14:50,109
distribution suboptimal behavior that is
you know actually optimal I mean this I

3566
01:14:50,109 --> 01:14:50,119
you know actually optimal I mean this I
 

3567
01:14:50,119 --> 01:14:51,490
you know actually optimal I mean this I
guess the idea of unintended consequence

3568
01:14:51,490 --> 01:14:51,500
guess the idea of unintended consequence
 

3569
01:14:51,500 --> 01:14:52,839
guess the idea of unintended consequence
you know it's I've don't respect what

3570
01:14:52,839 --> 01:14:52,849
you know it's I've don't respect what
 

3571
01:14:52,849 --> 01:14:54,549
you know it's I've don't respect what
you specified but it's not what you want

3572
01:14:54,549 --> 01:14:54,559
you specified but it's not what you want
 

3573
01:14:54,559 --> 01:14:56,919
you specified but it's not what you want
and there's a difference between those

3574
01:14:56,919 --> 01:14:56,929
and there's a difference between those
 

3575
01:14:56,929 --> 01:14:59,259
and there's a difference between those
but that's not fundamentally a robotics

3576
01:14:59,259 --> 01:14:59,269
but that's not fundamentally a robotics
 

3577
01:14:59,269 --> 01:15:01,629
but that's not fundamentally a robotics
problem it is a human problem so like

3578
01:15:01,629 --> 01:15:01,639
problem it is a human problem so like
 

3579
01:15:01,639 --> 01:15:03,850
problem it is a human problem so like
that's the thing yeah right so there is

3580
01:15:03,850 --> 01:15:03,860
that's the thing yeah right so there is
 

3581
01:15:03,860 --> 01:15:05,379
that's the thing yeah right so there is
this thing called good hearts law which

3582
01:15:05,379 --> 01:15:05,389
this thing called good hearts law which
 

3583
01:15:05,389 --> 01:15:06,700
this thing called good hearts law which
is you start a metric for an

3584
01:15:06,700 --> 01:15:06,710
is you start a metric for an
 

3585
01:15:06,710 --> 01:15:08,649
is you start a metric for an
organization and the moment it becomes

3586
01:15:08,649 --> 01:15:08,659
organization and the moment it becomes
 

3587
01:15:08,659 --> 01:15:12,459
organization and the moment it becomes
on target that people actually optimize

3588
01:15:12,459 --> 01:15:12,469
on target that people actually optimize
 

3589
01:15:12,469 --> 01:15:14,770
on target that people actually optimize
for it's no longer a good metric well

3590
01:15:14,770 --> 01:15:14,780
for it's no longer a good metric well
 

3591
01:15:14,780 --> 01:15:16,450
for it's no longer a good metric well
what's it called the good hearts law

3592
01:15:16,450 --> 01:15:16,460
what's it called the good hearts law
 

3593
01:15:16,460 --> 01:15:18,459
what's it called the good hearts law
good hearts Allah so the moment you

3594
01:15:18,459 --> 01:15:18,469
good hearts Allah so the moment you
 

3595
01:15:18,469 --> 01:15:21,069
good hearts Allah so the moment you
specify a metric it stops doing his job

3596
01:15:21,069 --> 01:15:21,079
specify a metric it stops doing his job
 

3597
01:15:21,079 --> 01:15:24,160
specify a metric it stops doing his job
yeah it stops doing his job um so

3598
01:15:24,160 --> 01:15:24,170
yeah it stops doing his job um so
 

3599
01:15:24,170 --> 01:15:25,330
yeah it stops doing his job um so
there's yeah there's such a thing as off

3600
01:15:25,330 --> 01:15:25,340
there's yeah there's such a thing as off
 

3601
01:15:25,340 --> 01:15:27,220
there's yeah there's such a thing as off
or optimizing for sayings and and you

3602
01:15:27,220 --> 01:15:27,230
or optimizing for sayings and and you
 

3603
01:15:27,230 --> 01:15:31,810
or optimizing for sayings and and you
know failing to to think ahead of time

3604
01:15:31,810 --> 01:15:31,820
know failing to to think ahead of time
 

3605
01:15:31,820 --> 01:15:34,089
know failing to to think ahead of time
of all the possible things that might be

3606
01:15:34,089 --> 01:15:34,099
of all the possible things that might be
 

3607
01:15:34,099 --> 01:15:36,879
of all the possible things that might be
important and so that's

3608
01:15:36,879 --> 01:15:36,889
important and so that's
 

3609
01:15:36,889 --> 01:15:40,239
important and so that's
so that's interesting because you story

3610
01:15:40,239 --> 01:15:40,249
so that's interesting because you story
 

3611
01:15:40,249 --> 01:15:41,679
so that's interesting because you story
I work a lot on every word learning from

I work a lot on every word learning from
 

3613
01:15:41,689 --> 01:15:43,359
I work a lot on every word learning from
the perspective of customizing to the

01:15:43,359 --> 01:15:43,369
the perspective of customizing to the
 

3615
01:15:43,369 --> 01:15:45,969
the perspective of customizing to the
end user but it really seems like it's

3616
01:15:45,969 --> 01:15:45,979
end user but it really seems like it's
 

3617
01:15:45,979 --> 01:15:48,429
end user but it really seems like it's
not just the interaction with the end

3625
01:15:55,039 --> 01:15:56,319
robot can do what the human one's right
that's kind of back and forward the

so what what does it mean right what is
 

3653
01:16:28,340 --> 01:16:29,919
so what what does it mean right what is
it when we think about the problem not

as someone specifies all of your job is
to optimize and we start thinking about

01:16:37,789 --> 01:16:40,629
your in this interaction and this
collaboration and the first thing that

3662
01:16:40,629 --> 01:16:40,639
collaboration and the first thing that
 

3663
01:16:40,639 --> 01:16:43,929
collaboration and the first thing that
comes up is when the person specifies a

3664
01:16:43,929 --> 01:16:43,939
comes up is when the person specifies a
 

3665
01:16:43,939 --> 01:16:46,959
comes up is when the person specifies a
reward it's not you know gossip was not

3667
01:16:46,969 --> 01:16:49,389
reward it's not you know gossip was not
like the letter of the law it's not the

01:16:49,389 --> 01:16:49,399
like the letter of the law it's not the
 

3669
01:16:49,399 --> 01:16:52,149
like the letter of the law it's not the
definition of the reward function you

3670
01:16:52,149 --> 01:16:52,159
definition of the reward function you
 

3671
01:16:52,159 --> 01:16:53,589
definition of the reward function you
should be optimizing because they're

3672
01:16:53,589 --> 01:16:53,599
should be optimizing because they're
 

3673
01:16:53,599 --> 01:16:55,389
should be optimizing because they're
doing their best but they're not some

01:16:57,639 --> 01:16:57,649
magic perfect Oracle and the sooner we
 

3677
01:16:57,649 --> 01:16:59,500
magic perfect Oracle and the sooner we
start understanding that I think the

robots that function better in different
 

3683
01:17:04,239 --> 01:17:07,569
robots that function better in different
situations and then then you have kind

3684
01:17:07,569 --> 01:17:07,579
situations and then then you have kind
 

3685
01:17:07,579 --> 01:17:09,489
situations and then then you have kind
of say okay well it's it's almost like

3686
01:17:09,489 --> 01:17:09,499
of say okay well it's it's almost like
 

3687
01:17:09,499 --> 01:17:13,629
of say okay well it's it's almost like
the robots are over learning over you're

01:17:13,629 --> 01:17:13,639
the robots are over learning over you're
 

3689
01:17:13,639 --> 01:17:15,370
the robots are over learning over you're
putting too much weight on the reward

3690
01:17:15,370 --> 01:17:15,380
putting too much weight on the reward
 

3691
01:17:15,380 --> 01:17:19,479
putting too much weight on the reward
specified by definition and maybe

leaving a lot of other information on
 

3695
01:17:21,169 --> 01:17:22,719
leaving a lot of other information on
the table like what are other things we

3696
01:17:22,719 --> 01:17:22,729
the table like what are other things we
 

3697
01:17:22,729 --> 01:17:24,699
the table like what are other things we
could do to actually communicate to the

3698
01:17:24,699 --> 01:17:24,709
could do to actually communicate to the
 

3699
01:17:24,709 --> 01:17:27,219
could do to actually communicate to the
robot about what we want them to do

3700
01:17:27,219 --> 01:17:27,229
robot about what we want them to do
 

3701
01:17:27,229 --> 01:17:29,319
robot about what we want them to do
besides attempting to specify a reward

3702
01:17:29,319 --> 01:17:29,329
besides attempting to specify a reward

besides attempting to specify a reward
phone yeah you have this awesome and

3704
01:17:31,779 --> 01:17:31,789
phone yeah you have this awesome and
 

3705
01:17:31,789 --> 01:17:33,729
phone yeah you have this awesome and
again it looks the poetry of leaked

3706
01:17:33,729 --> 01:17:33,739
again it looks the poetry of leaked
 

3707
01:17:33,739 --> 01:17:36,699
again it looks the poetry of leaked
information you mentioned

3708
01:17:36,699 --> 01:17:36,709
information you mentioned
 

3709
01:17:36,709 --> 01:17:39,009
information you mentioned
humans leaked information about what

3710
01:17:39,009 --> 01:17:39,019
humans leaked information about what
 

3711
01:17:39,019 --> 01:17:42,520
humans leaked information about what
they want you know leaked reward signal

3712
01:17:42,520 --> 01:17:42,530
they want you know leaked reward signal
 

3713
01:17:42,530 --> 01:17:45,939
they want you know leaked reward signal
for the for the robot so how do we

3714
01:17:45,939 --> 01:17:45,949
for the for the robot so how do we
 

3715
01:17:45,949 --> 01:17:48,669
for the for the robot so how do we
detect these leaks yeah what are these

3716
01:17:48,669 --> 01:17:48,679
detect these leaks yeah what are these
 

3717
01:17:48,679 --> 01:17:51,000
detect these leaks yeah what are these
leaks are they just I don't know

3718
01:17:51,000 --> 01:17:51,010
leaks are they just I don't know
 

3719
01:17:51,010 --> 01:17:54,029
leaks are they just I don't know
that those words recently saw it read it

3720
01:17:54,029 --> 01:17:54,039
that those words recently saw it read it
 

3721
01:17:54,039 --> 01:17:56,009
that those words recently saw it read it
I don't know where from you and that's

3722
01:17:56,009 --> 01:17:56,019
I don't know where from you and that's
 

3723
01:17:56,019 --> 01:17:58,169
I don't know where from you and that's
gonna stick with you for a while for

3724
01:17:58,169 --> 01:17:58,179
gonna stick with you for a while for
 

3725
01:17:58,179 --> 01:18:00,240
gonna stick with you for a while for
some reason because it's not explicitly

3726
01:18:00,240 --> 01:18:00,250
some reason because it's not explicitly
 

3727
01:18:00,250 --> 01:18:02,879
some reason because it's not explicitly
expressed it kind of leaks in directly

3728
01:18:02,879 --> 01:18:02,889
expressed it kind of leaks in directly
 

3729
01:18:02,889 --> 01:18:05,609
expressed it kind of leaks in directly
from our behavior we do yeah absolutely

3730
01:18:05,609 --> 01:18:05,619
from our behavior we do yeah absolutely
 

3731
01:18:05,619 --> 01:18:10,439
from our behavior we do yeah absolutely
so I think maybe something surprising

3732
01:18:10,439 --> 01:18:10,449
so I think maybe something surprising
 

3733
01:18:10,449 --> 01:18:13,080
so I think maybe something surprising
bits right so we were talking to before

3734
01:18:13,080 --> 01:18:13,090
bits right so we were talking to before
 

3735
01:18:13,090 --> 01:18:15,330
bits right so we were talking to before
about our my robot arm it needs to move

3736
01:18:15,330 --> 01:18:15,340
about our my robot arm it needs to move
 

3737
01:18:15,340 --> 01:18:18,689
about our my robot arm it needs to move
around people carry stuff put stuff away

3738
01:18:18,689 --> 01:18:18,699
around people carry stuff put stuff away
 

3739
01:18:18,699 --> 01:18:24,959
around people carry stuff put stuff away
all of that and now imagine that you

3740
01:18:24,959 --> 01:18:24,969
all of that and now imagine that you
 

3741
01:18:24,969 --> 01:18:26,549
all of that and now imagine that you
know the robot has some initial

3742
01:18:26,549 --> 01:18:26,559
know the robot has some initial
 

3743
01:18:26,559 --> 01:18:29,100
know the robot has some initial
objective that the programmer gave it so

3744
01:18:29,100 --> 01:18:29,110
objective that the programmer gave it so
 

3745
01:18:29,110 --> 01:18:30,600
objective that the programmer gave it so
they can do all these things functional

3746
01:18:30,600 --> 01:18:30,610
they can do all these things functional
 

3747
01:18:30,610 --> 01:18:33,410
they can do all these things functional
it's capable of doing that and now I

3748
01:18:33,410 --> 01:18:33,420
it's capable of doing that and now I
 

3749
01:18:33,420 --> 01:18:35,879
it's capable of doing that and now I
noticed that it's doing something and

3750
01:18:35,879 --> 01:18:35,889
noticed that it's doing something and
 

3751
01:18:35,889 --> 01:18:38,759
noticed that it's doing something and
maybe it's coming too close to me

3752
01:18:38,759 --> 01:18:38,769
maybe it's coming too close to me
 

3753
01:18:38,769 --> 01:18:40,649
maybe it's coming too close to me
alright and maybe I'm the designer maybe

3754
01:18:40,649 --> 01:18:40,659
alright and maybe I'm the designer maybe
 

3755
01:18:40,659 --> 01:18:42,180
alright and maybe I'm the designer maybe
I'm the end-user and this robot is now

3756
01:18:42,180 --> 01:18:42,190
I'm the end-user and this robot is now
 

3757
01:18:42,190 --> 01:18:48,120
I'm the end-user and this robot is now
in my home and I push it away so I push

3758
01:18:48,120 --> 01:18:48,130
in my home and I push it away so I push
 

3759
01:18:48,130 --> 01:18:50,310
in my home and I push it away so I push
away cuz you know it's a it's a reaction

3760
01:18:50,310 --> 01:18:50,320
away cuz you know it's a it's a reaction
 

3761
01:18:50,320 --> 01:18:52,200
away cuz you know it's a it's a reaction
to what the robot is currently doing and

3762
01:18:52,200 --> 01:18:52,210
to what the robot is currently doing and
 

3763
01:18:52,210 --> 01:18:54,509
to what the robot is currently doing and
this is what we call physical human

3764
01:18:54,509 --> 01:18:54,519
this is what we call physical human
 

3765
01:18:54,519 --> 01:18:56,580
this is what we call physical human
robot interaction and now there's a lot

3766
01:18:56,580 --> 01:18:56,590
robot interaction and now there's a lot
 

3767
01:18:56,590 --> 01:18:58,529
robot interaction and now there's a lot
of there's a lot of interesting work on

3768
01:18:58,529 --> 01:18:58,539
of there's a lot of interesting work on
 

3769
01:18:58,539 --> 01:19:00,629
of there's a lot of interesting work on
how do you respond to physical human

3770
01:19:00,629 --> 01:19:00,639
how do you respond to physical human
 

3771
01:19:00,639 --> 01:19:01,770
how do you respond to physical human
robot interaction why should the robot

3772
01:19:01,770 --> 01:19:01,780
robot interaction why should the robot
 

3773
01:19:01,780 --> 01:19:03,720
robot interaction why should the robot
do if such an event occurs and there's

3774
01:19:03,720 --> 01:19:03,730
do if such an event occurs and there's
 

3775
01:19:03,730 --> 01:19:04,680
do if such an event occurs and there's
sort of different schools of thought

3776
01:19:04,680 --> 01:19:04,690
sort of different schools of thought
 

3777
01:19:04,690 --> 01:19:06,930
sort of different schools of thought
it's well you know you can sort of treat

3778
01:19:06,930 --> 01:19:06,940
it's well you know you can sort of treat
 

3779
01:19:06,940 --> 01:19:08,399
it's well you know you can sort of treat
it to control theoretical and say this

01:19:08,399 --> 01:19:08,409
it to control theoretical and say this
 

3781
01:19:08,409 --> 01:19:10,339
it to control theoretical and say this
is a disturbance that you must reject

3782
01:19:10,339 --> 01:19:10,349
is a disturbance that you must reject
 

3783
01:19:10,349 --> 01:19:15,299
is a disturbance that you must reject
you can sort of treat it more a kind of

01:19:15,299 --> 01:19:15,309
you can sort of treat it more a kind of
 

3785
01:19:15,309 --> 01:19:16,770
you can sort of treat it more a kind of

some like gravity compensation mode so

3788
01:19:18,390 --> 01:19:18,400
some like gravity compensation mode so
 

3789
01:19:18,400 --> 01:19:19,859
some like gravity compensation mode so
that means very maneuverable around I'm

realization has been that that is signal
 

3797
01:19:28,630 --> 01:19:30,450

because if my robot was moving in an
 

3801
01:19:32,949 --> 01:19:36,810
because if my robot was moving in an
optimal way and I intervened that means

3802
01:19:36,810 --> 01:19:36,820
optimal way and I intervened that means
 

3803
01:19:36,820 --> 01:19:38,580
optimal way and I intervened that means
that I disagree which is notion of

optimization problems aside that means
 

3811
01:19:46,389 --> 01:19:49,100
optimization problems aside that means
that the cost versus reward function is

3812

that the cost versus reward function is
 

3813
01:19:49,110 --> 01:19:52,379
that the cost versus reward function is

3826
01:20:07,890 --> 01:20:07,900
go on a safety driver disengages the car
 

3827
01:20:07,900 --> 01:20:10,680
go on a safety driver disengages the car
like they could have disengaged it for a

3828
01:20:10,680 --> 01:20:10,690
like they could have disengaged it for a
 

3829
01:20:10,690 --> 01:20:14,790
like they could have disengaged it for a
million reasons yeah yeah so that's true

3830
01:20:14,790 --> 01:20:14,800
million reasons yeah yeah so that's true
 

3831
01:20:14,800 --> 01:20:18,900
million reasons yeah yeah so that's true
again it comes back to Kenya can you

that gives you information about what it
 

3857
01:20:43,570 --> 01:20:45,120
that gives you information about what it

01:20:46,690 --> 01:20:48,600
people want you to stay further away
from them now you're right that there

3862
01:20:48,600 --> 01:20:48,610
from them now you're right that there
 

3863
01:20:48,610 --> 01:20:50,520
from them now you're right that there
might be many things that explain just

might be many things that explain just
 

3865
01:20:50,530 --> 01:20:52,440
might be many things that explain just
at one signal that you might need much

more data than that for the person be
 

3869
01:20:54,880 --> 01:20:56,610
more data than that for the person be
able to shape your reward function over

01:21:01,950 --> 01:21:01,960
stuff that we were talking about now now
 

3875
01:21:01,960 --> 01:21:03,540
stuff that we were talking about now now
we've done that in that context just to

we've done that in that context just to
 

3877
01:21:03,550 --> 01:21:04,890
we've done that in that context just to
clarify but it's definitely somebody

01:21:04,890 --> 01:21:04,900
clarify but it's definitely somebody
 

3879
01:21:04,900 --> 01:21:08,520
clarify but it's definitely somebody

thought about where you can have the
 

3881
01:21:08,530 --> 01:21:10,710
thought about where you can have the
robot start acting in a way like if

3882
01:21:10,710 --> 01:21:10,720
robot start acting in a way like if
 

3883
01:21:10,720 --> 01:21:11,820
robot start acting in a way like if
there's a bunch of different

there's a bunch of different
 

3885
01:21:11,830 --> 01:21:14,430
there's a bunch of different
explanations right it moves in a way

3886
01:21:14,430 --> 01:21:14,440
explanations right it moves in a way
 

3887
01:21:14,440 --> 01:21:16,650
explanations right it moves in a way
where it sees if you corrected in some

3888
01:21:16,650 --> 01:21:16,660
where it sees if you corrected in some
 

3889
01:21:16,660 --> 01:21:18,450
where it sees if you corrected in some
other way or not and then kind of

3890
01:21:18,450 --> 01:21:18,460
other way or not and then kind of
 

3891
01:21:18,460 --> 01:21:20,660
other way or not and then kind of
actually plans its motion so that it can

3892
01:21:20,660 --> 01:21:20,670
actually plans its motion so that it can
 

3893
01:21:20,670 --> 01:21:22,440
actually plans its motion so that it can
disambiguate then collect information

3894
01:21:22,440 --> 01:21:22,450
disambiguate then collect information
 

3895
01:21:22,450 --> 01:21:25,560
disambiguate then collect information
about what you want anyway so that's one

3896
01:21:25,560 --> 01:21:25,570
about what you want anyway so that's one
 

3897
01:21:25,570 --> 01:21:26,910
about what you want anyway so that's one
way that's cut a sort of leaked

3898
01:21:26,910 --> 01:21:26,920
way that's cut a sort of leaked
 

3899
01:21:26,920 --> 01:21:28,440
way that's cut a sort of leaked
information maybe even more subtle

3900
01:21:28,440 --> 01:21:28,450
information maybe even more subtle
 

3901
01:21:28,450 --> 01:21:30,900
information maybe even more subtle
leaked information is if I just press

3902
01:21:30,900 --> 01:21:30,910
leaked information is if I just press
 

3903
01:21:30,910 --> 01:21:33,570
leaked information is if I just press
the e stop right I just I'm doing it out

3904
01:21:33,570 --> 01:21:33,580
the e stop right I just I'm doing it out
 

3905
01:21:33,580 --> 01:21:34,770
the e stop right I just I'm doing it out
of panic because the robot is about to

3906
01:21:34,770 --> 01:21:34,780
of panic because the robot is about to
 

3907
01:21:34,780 --> 01:21:36,840
of panic because the robot is about to
do something bad there's again

3908
01:21:36,840 --> 01:21:36,850
do something bad there's again
 

3909
01:21:36,850 --> 01:21:39,090
do something bad there's again
information there right okay the robot

3910
01:21:39,090 --> 01:21:39,100
information there right okay the robot
 

3911
01:21:39,100 --> 01:21:41,700
information there right okay the robot
should definitely stop but it should

3912
01:21:41,700 --> 01:21:41,710
should definitely stop but it should
 

3913
01:21:41,710 --> 01:21:43,380
should definitely stop but it should
also figure out that whatever was about

3914
01:21:43,380 --> 01:21:43,390
also figure out that whatever was about
 

3915
01:21:43,390 --> 01:21:45,990
also figure out that whatever was about
to do was not good and in fact it was so

3916
01:21:45,990 --> 01:21:46,000
to do was not good and in fact it was so
 

3917
01:21:46,000 --> 01:21:48,000
to do was not good and in fact it was so
not good then stopping and remaining

3918
01:21:48,000 --> 01:21:48,010
not good then stopping and remaining
 

3919
01:21:48,010 --> 01:21:50,100
not good then stopping and remaining
stop for a while was better a better

3920
01:21:50,100 --> 01:21:50,110
stop for a while was better a better
 

3921
01:21:50,110 --> 01:21:51,780
stop for a while was better a better
trajectory for it than whatever it is

3922
01:21:51,780 --> 01:21:51,790
trajectory for it than whatever it is
 

3923
01:21:51,790 --> 01:21:53,340
trajectory for it than whatever it is
that it was about to do and that again

3924
01:21:53,340 --> 01:21:53,350
that it was about to do and that again
 

3925
01:21:53,350 --> 01:21:55,290
that it was about to do and that again

just talked about how you try to say
 

3985
01:23:15,570 --> 01:23:19,160
just talked about how you try to say
what you want but you don't always get

what you want but you don't always get
 

3987
01:23:19,170 --> 01:23:21,380
what you want but you don't always get
it right and you want these machines to

01:23:21,380 --> 01:23:21,390
it right and you want these machines to
 

3989
01:23:21,390 --> 01:23:23,600
it right and you want these machines to
do what you want not necessarily exactly

3990
01:23:23,600 --> 01:23:23,610
do what you want not necessarily exactly
 

3991
01:23:23,610 --> 01:23:25,100
do what you want not necessarily exactly
what your literacy you want them you

3992
01:23:25,100 --> 01:23:25,110
what your literacy you want them you
 

3993
01:23:25,110 --> 01:23:26,450
what your literacy you want them you
don't want them to take you literally

3994
01:23:26,450 --> 01:23:26,460
don't want them to take you literally
 

3995
01:23:26,460 --> 01:23:29,180
don't want them to take you literally
you want to take what you're saying and

3996
01:23:29,180 --> 01:23:29,190
you want to take what you're saying and
 

3997
01:23:29,190 --> 01:23:32,000
you want to take what you're saying and
interpret it in context and that's what

3998
01:23:32,000 --> 01:23:32,010
interpret it in context and that's what
 

3999
01:23:32,010 --> 01:23:33,590
interpret it in context and that's what
we do with the specified rewards we

4000

we do with the specified rewards we
 

4001
01:23:33,600 --> 01:23:35,570
we do with the specified rewards we
don't take them literally anymore from

01:23:35,570 --> 01:23:35,580
don't take them literally anymore from

don't take them literally anymore from
the designer we not we as a community we

01:23:46,050 --> 01:23:50,120
in some of our collaborators like Peter
bol and Stuart Russell we sort of say

4010
01:23:50,120 --> 01:23:50,130
bol and Stuart Russell we sort of say
 

4011
01:23:50,130 --> 01:23:52,480
bol and Stuart Russell we sort of say
okay the designer specified this thing

4012
01:23:52,480 --> 01:23:52,490
okay the designer specified this thing
 

4013
01:23:52,490 --> 01:23:55,790
okay the designer specified this thing
but I'm gonna interpret it not as this

4014
01:23:55,790 --> 01:23:55,800
but I'm gonna interpret it not as this
 

4015
01:23:55,800 --> 01:23:57,290
but I'm gonna interpret it not as this
is universal reward function that I

4016
01:23:57,290 --> 01:23:57,300
is universal reward function that I
 

4017

is universal reward function that I
shall always optimize always and forever

4018
01:23:59,000 --> 01:23:59,010
shall always optimize always and forever
 

4019
01:23:59,010 --> 01:24:03,770
shall always optimize always and forever
but as this is good evidence about what

4020
01:24:03,770 --> 01:24:03,780
but as this is good evidence about what
 

4021
01:24:03,780 --> 01:24:06,590
but as this is good evidence about what
the person wants and I should interpret

4022
01:24:06,590 --> 01:24:06,600
the person wants and I should interpret
 

4023
01:24:06,600 --> 01:24:08,420
the person wants and I should interpret
that evidence in the context of these

4024
01:24:08,420 --> 01:24:08,430
that evidence in the context of these
 

4025
01:24:08,430 --> 01:24:10,580
that evidence in the context of these
situations that it was specified for

4026
01:24:10,580 --> 01:24:10,590
situations that it was specified for
 

4027
01:24:10,590 --> 01:24:11,990
situations that it was specified for
because ultimately that's what the

4028
01:24:11,990 --> 01:24:12,000
because ultimately that's what the
 

4029
01:24:12,000 --> 01:24:13,220
because ultimately that's what the
designers thought about that's what they

4030
01:24:13,220 --> 01:24:13,230
designers thought about that's what they
 

4031
01:24:13,230 --> 01:24:15,860
designers thought about that's what they
had in mind and really them specifying a

4032
01:24:15,860 --> 01:24:15,870
had in mind and really them specifying a
 

4033
01:24:15,870 --> 01:24:17,630
had in mind and really them specifying a
reward function that works for me in all

4034
01:24:17,630 --> 01:24:17,640
reward function that works for me in all
 

4035
01:24:17,640 --> 01:24:20,510
reward function that works for me in all
these situations is really kind of

4036
01:24:20,510 --> 01:24:20,520
these situations is really kind of
 

4037
01:24:20,520 --> 01:24:22,250
these situations is really kind of
telling me that whatever behavior that

4038
01:24:22,250 --> 01:24:22,260
telling me that whatever behavior that
 

4039
01:24:22,260 --> 01:24:24,020
telling me that whatever behavior that
incentivizes must be good behavior

4040
01:24:24,020 --> 01:24:24,030
incentivizes must be good behavior
 

4041
01:24:24,030 --> 01:24:26,330
incentivizes must be good behavior
respect to the thing that I should

01:24:26,330 --> 01:24:26,340
respect to the thing that I should
 

4043
01:24:26,340 --> 01:24:28,419
respect to the thing that I should
actually be optimizing for and so

4044
01:24:28,419 --> 01:24:28,429
actually be optimizing for and so
 

4045
01:24:28,429 --> 01:24:30,009
actually be optimizing for and so
now the robot kinda has uncertainty

4046
01:24:30,009 --> 01:24:30,019
now the robot kinda has uncertainty
 

4047
01:24:30,019 --> 01:24:32,529
now the robot kinda has uncertainty
about what it is that it should be what

4048
01:24:32,529 --> 01:24:32,539
about what it is that it should be what
 

4049
01:24:32,539 --> 01:24:34,719
about what it is that it should be what
its reward function is and then there's

4050
01:24:34,719 --> 01:24:34,729
its reward function is and then there's
 

4051
01:24:34,729 --> 01:24:36,669
its reward function is and then there's
all these additional signals we've been

4052
01:24:36,669 --> 01:24:36,679
all these additional signals we've been
 

4053
01:24:36,679 --> 01:24:39,040
all these additional signals we've been
finding that it can kind of continually

4054
01:24:39,040 --> 01:24:39,050
finding that it can kind of continually
 

4055
01:24:39,050 --> 01:24:40,779
finding that it can kind of continually
learn from and adapt its understanding

4056
01:24:40,779 --> 01:24:40,789
learn from and adapt its understanding
 

4057
01:24:40,789 --> 01:24:42,100
learn from and adapt its understanding
of what people want every time the

4058
01:24:42,100 --> 01:24:42,110
of what people want every time the
 

4059
01:24:42,110 --> 01:24:43,209
of what people want every time the
person corrected

4060
01:24:43,209 --> 01:24:43,219
person corrected
 

4061
01:24:43,219 --> 01:24:45,160
person corrected
maybe they demonstrate maybe they

4062
01:24:45,160 --> 01:24:45,170
maybe they demonstrate maybe they
 

4063
01:24:45,170 --> 01:24:49,149
maybe they demonstrate maybe they
stopped hopefully not right one really

4064
01:24:49,149 --> 01:24:49,159
stopped hopefully not right one really
 

4065
01:24:49,159 --> 01:24:53,739
stopped hopefully not right one really
really crazy one is the environment

4066
01:24:53,739 --> 01:24:53,749
really crazy one is the environment
 

4067
01:24:53,749 --> 01:24:58,390
really crazy one is the environment
itself like our world you don't it's not

4068
01:24:58,390 --> 01:24:58,400
itself like our world you don't it's not
 

4069
01:24:58,400 --> 01:25:00,609
itself like our world you don't it's not
you know you observe our world and and

4070
01:25:00,609 --> 01:25:00,619
you know you observe our world and and
 

4071
01:25:00,619 --> 01:25:02,589
you know you observe our world and and
the state of it and it's not that you're

4072
01:25:02,589 --> 01:25:02,599
the state of it and it's not that you're
 

4073
01:25:02,599 --> 01:25:03,939
the state of it and it's not that you're
seeing behavior and you're saying how

4074
01:25:03,939 --> 01:25:03,949
seeing behavior and you're saying how
 

4075
01:25:03,949 --> 01:25:05,410
seeing behavior and you're saying how
people are making decisions that are

4076
01:25:05,410 --> 01:25:05,420
people are making decisions that are
 

4077
01:25:05,420 --> 01:25:08,589
people are making decisions that are
rational bla bla bla it's but but but

4078
01:25:08,589 --> 01:25:08,599
rational bla bla bla it's but but but
 

4079
01:25:08,599 --> 01:25:10,779
rational bla bla bla it's but but but
our world is something that we've been

4080
01:25:10,779 --> 01:25:10,789
our world is something that we've been
 

4081
01:25:10,789 --> 01:25:13,479
our world is something that we've been
acting when according to our preferences

4082
01:25:13,479 --> 01:25:13,489
acting when according to our preferences
 

4083
01:25:13,489 --> 01:25:15,699
acting when according to our preferences
so I have this example where like the

4084
01:25:15,699 --> 01:25:15,709
so I have this example where like the
 

4085
01:25:15,709 --> 01:25:17,379
so I have this example where like the
robot walks into my home and my shoes

4086
01:25:17,379 --> 01:25:17,389
robot walks into my home and my shoes
 

4087
01:25:17,389 --> 01:25:19,839
robot walks into my home and my shoes
are laid down on the floor kind of in a

4088
01:25:19,839 --> 01:25:19,849
are laid down on the floor kind of in a
 

4089
01:25:19,849 --> 01:25:22,899
are laid down on the floor kind of in a
line right it took effort to do that

4090
01:25:22,899 --> 01:25:22,909
line right it took effort to do that
 

4091
01:25:22,909 --> 01:25:26,589
line right it took effort to do that
even though the robot doesn't see me

4092
01:25:26,589 --> 01:25:26,599
even though the robot doesn't see me
 

4093
01:25:26,599 --> 01:25:28,689
even though the robot doesn't see me
doing this you know actually aligning

4094
01:25:28,689 --> 01:25:28,699
doing this you know actually aligning
 

4095
01:25:28,699 --> 01:25:30,879
doing this you know actually aligning
the shoes it should still be able to

4096
01:25:30,879 --> 01:25:30,889
the shoes it should still be able to
 

4097
01:25:30,889 --> 01:25:32,679
the shoes it should still be able to
figure out that I want the shoes online

4098
01:25:32,679 --> 01:25:32,689
figure out that I want the shoes online
 

4099
01:25:32,689 --> 01:25:34,929
figure out that I want the shoes online
because there's no way for them to have

4100
01:25:34,929 --> 01:25:34,939
because there's no way for them to have
 

4101
01:25:34,939 --> 01:25:37,899
because there's no way for them to have
magically instantiated themselves in

4102
01:25:37,899 --> 01:25:37,909
magically instantiated themselves in
 

4103
01:25:37,909 --> 01:25:41,290
magically instantiated themselves in
that way someone must have actually just

4104
01:25:41,290 --> 01:25:41,300
that way someone must have actually just
 

4105
01:25:41,300 --> 01:25:44,049
that way someone must have actually just
a good time to do that so it must be

4106
01:25:44,049 --> 01:25:44,059
a good time to do that so it must be
 

4107
01:25:44,059 --> 01:25:45,939
a good time to do that so it must be
important so the environment actually

4108
01:25:45,939 --> 01:25:45,949
important so the environment actually
 

4109
01:25:45,949 --> 01:25:48,129
important so the environment actually
tells the varlets information at least

4110
01:25:48,129 --> 01:25:48,139
tells the varlets information at least
 

4111
01:25:48,139 --> 01:25:50,049
tells the varlets information at least
information I mean the environment is

4112
01:25:50,049 --> 01:25:50,059
information I mean the environment is
 

4113
01:25:50,059 --> 01:25:51,939
information I mean the environment is
the way it is because humans some are

4114
01:25:51,939 --> 01:25:51,949
the way it is because humans some are
 

4115
01:25:51,949 --> 01:25:54,160
the way it is because humans some are
manipulated is so you have to kind of

4116
01:25:54,160 --> 01:25:54,170
manipulated is so you have to kind of
 

4117
01:25:54,170 --> 01:25:55,689
manipulated is so you have to kind of
reverse engineer the narrative that

4118
01:25:55,689 --> 01:25:55,699
reverse engineer the narrative that
 

4119
01:25:55,699 --> 01:25:57,520
reverse engineer the narrative that
happened to create the environments it

4120
01:25:57,520 --> 01:25:57,530
happened to create the environments it
 

4121
01:25:57,530 --> 01:26:00,100
happened to create the environments it
is and that leaks the yeah yeah yeah

4122
01:26:00,100 --> 01:26:00,110
is and that leaks the yeah yeah yeah
 

4123
01:26:00,110 --> 01:26:02,649
is and that leaks the yeah yeah yeah
mission yeah you have to be careful yeah

4124
01:26:02,649 --> 01:26:02,659
mission yeah you have to be careful yeah
 

4125
01:26:02,659 --> 01:26:05,290
mission yeah you have to be careful yeah
right because because people don't have

4126
01:26:05,290 --> 01:26:05,300
right because because people don't have
 

4127
01:26:05,300 --> 01:26:06,969
right because because people don't have
the bandwidth to do everything so just

4128
01:26:06,969 --> 01:26:06,979
the bandwidth to do everything so just
 

4129
01:26:06,979 --> 01:26:07,989
the bandwidth to do everything so just
because you know my house is messy

4130
01:26:07,989 --> 01:26:07,999
because you know my house is messy
 

4131
01:26:07,999 --> 01:26:10,359
because you know my house is messy
doesn't mean that I want it to be messy

4132
01:26:10,359 --> 01:26:10,369
doesn't mean that I want it to be messy
 

4133
01:26:10,369 --> 01:26:12,609
doesn't mean that I want it to be messy
right but that just shouldn't decide you

4134
01:26:12,609 --> 01:26:12,619
right but that just shouldn't decide you
 

4135
01:26:12,619 --> 01:26:14,199
right but that just shouldn't decide you
know I didn't put the effort into that I

4136
01:26:14,199 --> 01:26:14,209
know I didn't put the effort into that I
 

4137
01:26:14,209 --> 01:26:16,419
know I didn't put the effort into that I
put the effort into something else so

4138
01:26:16,419 --> 01:26:16,429
put the effort into something else so
 

4139
01:26:16,429 --> 01:26:17,770
put the effort into something else so
the robot should figure out well that's

4140
01:26:17,770 --> 01:26:17,780
the robot should figure out well that's
 

4141
01:26:17,780 --> 01:26:19,390
the robot should figure out well that's
something else was more important but it

4142
01:26:19,390 --> 01:26:19,400
something else was more important but it
 

4143
01:26:19,400 --> 01:26:20,679
something else was more important but it
doesn't mean that you know the house

4144
01:26:20,679 --> 01:26:20,689
doesn't mean that you know the house
 

4145
01:26:20,689 --> 01:26:22,419
doesn't mean that you know the house
being messy is not so it's a little

4146
01:26:22,419 --> 01:26:22,429
being messy is not so it's a little
 

4147
01:26:22,429 --> 01:26:24,219
being messy is not so it's a little
subtle but yeah we really think of it

4148
01:26:24,219 --> 01:26:24,229
subtle but yeah we really think of it
 

4149
01:26:24,229 --> 01:26:26,199
subtle but yeah we really think of it
the state itself is kind of like a

4150
01:26:26,199 --> 01:26:26,209
the state itself is kind of like a
 

4151
01:26:26,209 --> 01:26:29,799
the state itself is kind of like a
choice that people implicitly made on

4152
01:26:29,799 --> 01:26:29,809
choice that people implicitly made on
 

4153
01:26:29,809 --> 01:26:32,709
choice that people implicitly made on
how they want their world what book or

4154
01:26:32,709 --> 01:26:32,719
how they want their world what book or
 

4155
01:26:32,719 --> 01:26:34,959
how they want their world what book or
books technical fiction or philosophical

had a big impact maybe it was a turning

01:26:40,479 --> 01:26:40,489
had a big impact maybe it was a turning
 

4161
01:26:40,489 --> 01:26:42,110
had a big impact maybe it was a turning
point was inspiring

4162
01:26:42,110 --> 01:26:42,120
point was inspiring
 

4163
01:26:42,120 --> 01:26:44,330
point was inspiring
maybe we're talking about some silly

4164
01:26:44,330 --> 01:26:44,340
maybe we're talking about some silly
 

4165
01:26:44,340 --> 01:26:47,210
maybe we're talking about some silly
book that nobody in their right mind

4166
01:26:47,210 --> 01:26:47,220
book that nobody in their right mind
 

4167
01:26:47,220 --> 01:26:49,490
book that nobody in their right mind
would want to read or maybe it's a book

4168
01:26:49,490 --> 01:26:49,500
would want to read or maybe it's a book
 

4169
01:26:49,500 --> 01:26:52,250
would want to read or maybe it's a book
that you would recommend to others to

4170
01:26:52,250 --> 01:26:52,260
that you would recommend to others to
 

4171
01:26:52,260 --> 01:26:53,570
that you would recommend to others to
read or maybe those could be two

4172
01:26:53,570 --> 01:26:53,580
read or maybe those could be two
 

4173
01:26:53,580 --> 01:26:56,840

different recommendations that of books
 

4175
01:26:56,850 --> 01:26:59,960
different recommendations that of books
that could be useful for people on their

that could be useful for people on their
 

4177
01:26:59,970 --> 01:27:03,890
that could be useful for people on their
journey when I was in it's kind of a

4178
01:27:03,890 --> 01:27:03,900
journey when I was in it's kind of a
 

4179
01:27:03,900 --> 01:27:05,330
journey when I was in it's kind of a
personal story when I was in 12th grade

4180
01:27:05,330 --> 01:27:05,340
personal story when I was in 12th grade
 

4181
01:27:05,340 --> 01:27:10,850
personal story when I was in 12th grade
I got my hands on a PDF copy in Romania

4182
01:27:10,850 --> 01:27:10,860
I got my hands on a PDF copy in Romania
 

4183
01:27:10,860 --> 01:27:14,960
I got my hands on a PDF copy in Romania
of Russell Norvig a I modern approach I

4184
01:27:14,960 --> 01:27:14,970
of Russell Norvig a I modern approach I
 

4185
01:27:14,970 --> 01:27:16,970
of Russell Norvig a I modern approach I
didn't know anything about AI at that

4186
01:27:16,970 --> 01:27:16,980
didn't know anything about AI at that
 

4187
01:27:16,980 --> 01:27:19,820
didn't know anything about AI at that
point I was you know I had watched the

4188
01:27:19,820 --> 01:27:19,830
point I was you know I had watched the
 

4189
01:27:19,830 --> 01:27:27,440
point I was you know I had watched the
movie The Matrix and and so I started

4190
01:27:27,440 --> 01:27:27,450
movie The Matrix and and so I started
 

4191
01:27:27,450 --> 01:27:30,530
movie The Matrix and and so I started
going through this thing and you know

4192
01:27:30,530 --> 01:27:30,540
going through this thing and you know
 

4193
01:27:30,540 --> 01:27:32,420
going through this thing and you know
you were asking in the beginning what

4194
01:27:32,420 --> 01:27:32,430
you were asking in the beginning what
 

4195
01:27:32,430 --> 01:27:34,670
you were asking in the beginning what
are what are you and just it's it you

4196
01:27:34,670 --> 01:27:34,680
are what are you and just it's it you
 

4197
01:27:34,680 --> 01:27:36,080
are what are you and just it's it you
know it's math and it's algorithms

4198
01:27:36,080 --> 01:27:36,090
know it's math and it's algorithms
 

4199
01:27:36,090 --> 01:27:38,630
know it's math and it's algorithms
what's interesting it was so captivating

4200
01:27:38,630 --> 01:27:38,640
what's interesting it was so captivating
 

4201
01:27:38,640 --> 01:27:41,450
what's interesting it was so captivating
this notion that you could just have a

4202
01:27:41,450 --> 01:27:41,460
this notion that you could just have a
 

4203
01:27:41,460 --> 01:27:44,870
this notion that you could just have a
goal and figure out your way through a

4204
01:27:44,870 --> 01:27:44,880
goal and figure out your way through a
 

4205
01:27:44,880 --> 01:27:47,780
goal and figure out your way through a
kind of a messy complicated situation

4206
01:27:47,780 --> 01:27:47,790
kind of a messy complicated situation
 

4207
01:27:47,790 --> 01:27:50,420
kind of a messy complicated situation
so what sequence of decisions you should

4208
01:27:50,420 --> 01:27:50,430
so what sequence of decisions you should
 

4209
01:27:50,430 --> 01:27:53,150
so what sequence of decisions you should
make art autonomously to achieve that

4210
01:27:53,150 --> 01:27:53,160
make art autonomously to achieve that
 

4211
01:27:53,160 --> 01:27:56,630
make art autonomously to achieve that
goal that was so cool I'm you know I'm

4212
01:27:56,630 --> 01:27:56,640
goal that was so cool I'm you know I'm
 

4213
01:27:56,640 --> 01:28:00,500
goal that was so cool I'm you know I'm
biased but that's a cool book yeah you

4214
01:28:00,500 --> 01:28:00,510
biased but that's a cool book yeah you
 

4215
01:28:00,510 --> 01:28:03,500
biased but that's a cool book yeah you
can convert you know the goal the goal

4216
01:28:03,500 --> 01:28:03,510
can convert you know the goal the goal
 

4217
01:28:03,510 --> 01:28:05,030
can convert you know the goal the goal
of and tell it the process of

4218
01:28:05,030 --> 01:28:05,040
of and tell it the process of
 

4219
01:28:05,040 --> 01:28:07,340
of and tell it the process of
intelligence and mechanize it I had the

4220
01:28:07,340 --> 01:28:07,350
intelligence and mechanize it I had the
 

4221
01:28:07,350 --> 01:28:08,690
intelligence and mechanize it I had the
same experience I was really interested

4222
01:28:08,690 --> 01:28:08,700
same experience I was really interested
 

4223
01:28:08,700 --> 01:28:10,760
same experience I was really interested
in psychiatry and trying to understand

4224
01:28:10,760 --> 01:28:10,770
in psychiatry and trying to understand
 

4225
01:28:10,770 --> 01:28:13,190
in psychiatry and trying to understand
human behavior and then AI a modern

4226
01:28:13,190 --> 01:28:13,200
human behavior and then AI a modern
 

4227
01:28:13,200 --> 01:28:15,320
human behavior and then AI a modern
approach is like wait you can just

4228
01:28:15,320 --> 01:28:15,330
approach is like wait you can just
 

4229
01:28:15,330 --> 01:28:20,840
approach is like wait you can just
reduce it all yeah so that's and I think

4230
01:28:20,840 --> 01:28:20,850
reduce it all yeah so that's and I think
 

4231
01:28:20,850 --> 01:28:22,220
reduce it all yeah so that's and I think
that's stuck with me cuz you know a lot

4232
01:28:22,220 --> 01:28:22,230
that's stuck with me cuz you know a lot
 

4233
01:28:22,230 --> 01:28:22,970
that's stuck with me cuz you know a lot
of what I do

4234
01:28:22,970 --> 01:28:22,980
of what I do
 

4235
01:28:22,980 --> 01:28:27,560
of what I do
a lot of what we do in my lab is write

4236
01:28:27,560 --> 01:28:27,570
a lot of what we do in my lab is write
 

4237
01:28:27,570 --> 01:28:29,270
a lot of what we do in my lab is write
math about human behavior combine it

4238
01:28:29,270 --> 01:28:29,280
math about human behavior combine it
 

4239
01:28:29,280 --> 01:28:30,950
math about human behavior combine it
with data and learning put it all

4240
01:28:30,950 --> 01:28:30,960
with data and learning put it all
 

4241
01:28:30,960 --> 01:28:32,810
with data and learning put it all
together give it to robots to plan wit

4242
01:28:32,810 --> 01:28:32,820
together give it to robots to plan wit
 

4243
01:28:32,820 --> 01:28:34,940
together give it to robots to plan wit
and you know hope that instead of

4244
01:28:34,940 --> 01:28:34,950
and you know hope that instead of
 

4245
01:28:34,950 --> 01:28:37,640
and you know hope that instead of
writing rules for the robots writing

4246
01:28:37,640 --> 01:28:37,650
writing rules for the robots writing
 

4247
01:28:37,650 --> 01:28:39,770
writing rules for the robots writing
heuristics designing behavior they can

4248
01:28:39,770 --> 01:28:39,780
heuristics designing behavior they can
 

4249
01:28:39,780 --> 01:28:42,290
heuristics designing behavior they can
actually autonomously come up with the

4250
01:28:42,290 --> 01:28:42,300
actually autonomously come up with the
 

4251
01:28:42,300 --> 01:28:44,150
actually autonomously come up with the
right thing to do around people that's

4252
01:28:44,150 --> 01:28:44,160
right thing to do around people that's
 

4253
01:28:44,160 --> 01:28:45,260
right thing to do around people that's
kind of our you know that's our

4254
01:28:45,260 --> 01:28:45,270
kind of our you know that's our
 

4255
01:28:45,270 --> 01:28:46,040
kind of our you know that's our
signature move

4256
01:28:46,040 --> 01:28:46,050
signature move
 

4257
01:28:46,050 --> 01:28:48,290
signature move
it's we wrote some mass and then instead

4258
01:28:48,290 --> 01:28:48,300
it's we wrote some mass and then instead
 

4259
01:28:48,300 --> 01:28:49,790
it's we wrote some mass and then instead
of kind of hand crafting this and that

4260
01:28:49,790 --> 01:28:49,800
of kind of hand crafting this and that
 

4261
01:28:49,800 --> 01:28:51,620
of kind of hand crafting this and that
and that and the robots figuring stuff

4262
01:28:51,620 --> 01:28:51,630
and that and the robots figuring stuff
 

4263
01:28:51,630 --> 01:28:54,170
and that and the robots figuring stuff
out and isn't that cool and I think that

4264
01:28:54,170 --> 01:28:54,180
out and isn't that cool and I think that
 

4265
01:28:54,180 --> 01:28:55,910
out and isn't that cool and I think that
is the same enthusiasm that I

4266
01:28:55,910 --> 01:28:55,920
is the same enthusiasm that I
 

4267
01:28:55,920 --> 01:28:57,680
is the same enthusiasm that I
got from there I figured out how to

4268
01:28:57,680 --> 01:28:57,690
got from there I figured out how to
 

4269
01:28:57,690 --> 01:29:00,200
got from there I figured out how to
reach that goal in that graph isn't that

4270
01:29:00,200 --> 01:29:00,210
reach that goal in that graph isn't that
 

4271
01:29:00,210 --> 01:29:05,150
reach that goal in that graph isn't that
cool so apologize for the romanticized

4272
01:29:05,150 --> 01:29:05,160
cool so apologize for the romanticized
 

4273
01:29:05,160 --> 01:29:08,030
cool so apologize for the romanticized
questions but and the silly ones if a

4274
01:29:08,030 --> 01:29:08,040
questions but and the silly ones if a
 

4275
01:29:08,040 --> 01:29:12,110
questions but and the silly ones if a
doctor gave you five years to live sort

4276
01:29:12,110 --> 01:29:12,120
doctor gave you five years to live sort
 

4277
01:29:12,120 --> 01:29:14,780
doctor gave you five years to live sort
of emphasizing the finiteness of our

4278
01:29:14,780 --> 01:29:14,790
of emphasizing the finiteness of our
 

4279
01:29:14,790 --> 01:29:15,470
of emphasizing the finiteness of our
existence

4280
01:29:15,470 --> 01:29:15,480
existence
 

4281
01:29:15,480 --> 01:29:20,870
existence
what would you try to accomplish it's

4282
01:29:20,870 --> 01:29:20,880
what would you try to accomplish it's
 

4283
01:29:20,880 --> 01:29:22,669
what would you try to accomplish it's
like my biggest nightmare by the way I

4284
01:29:22,669 --> 01:29:22,679
like my biggest nightmare by the way I
 

4285
01:29:22,679 --> 01:29:27,410
like my biggest nightmare by the way I
really like living I really don't like

4286
01:29:27,410 --> 01:29:27,420
really like living I really don't like
 

4287
01:29:27,420 --> 01:29:30,490
really like living I really don't like
dying of being told that I'm gonna die

4288
01:29:30,490 --> 01:29:30,500
dying of being told that I'm gonna die
 

4289
01:29:30,500 --> 01:29:32,750
dying of being told that I'm gonna die
sorry Dylan got enough for a second do

4292
01:29:35,330 --> 01:29:35,340
you I mean do you meditate or ponder on
 

4293
01:29:35,340 --> 01:29:38,240
you I mean do you meditate or ponder on
your mortality on our human the fact

4294
01:29:38,240 --> 01:29:38,250
your mortality on our human the fact
 

4295
01:29:38,250 --> 01:29:39,680
your mortality on our human the fact
that this thing ends it seems to be a

4296
01:29:39,680 --> 01:29:39,690
that this thing ends it seems to be a
 

4297
01:29:39,690 --> 01:29:42,020
that this thing ends it seems to be a
fundamental feature do you think of it

4298
01:29:42,020 --> 01:29:42,030
fundamental feature do you think of it
 

4299
01:29:42,030 --> 01:29:45,560
fundamental feature do you think of it
as a feature or a bug - is it you you

4300
01:29:45,560 --> 01:29:45,570
as a feature or a bug - is it you you
 

4301
01:29:45,570 --> 01:29:47,300
as a feature or a bug - is it you you
said you don't like the idea of dying

4302
01:29:47,300 --> 01:29:47,310
said you don't like the idea of dying
 

4303
01:29:47,310 --> 01:29:49,610
said you don't like the idea of dying
but if I were to give you a choice of

4304
01:29:49,610 --> 01:29:49,620
but if I were to give you a choice of
 

4305
01:29:49,620 --> 01:29:51,680
but if I were to give you a choice of
living forever like you're not allowed

4306
01:29:51,680 --> 01:29:51,690
living forever like you're not allowed
 

4307
01:29:51,690 --> 01:29:53,419
living forever like you're not allowed
to die yeah now I'll say that I'm

4308
01:29:53,419 --> 01:29:53,429
to die yeah now I'll say that I'm
 

4309
01:29:53,429 --> 01:29:55,760
to die yeah now I'll say that I'm
wandering forever but I watch this show

4310
01:29:55,760 --> 01:29:55,770
wandering forever but I watch this show
 

4311
01:29:55,770 --> 01:29:57,290
wandering forever but I watch this show
it's very still it's called a good place

4312
01:29:57,290 --> 01:29:57,300
it's very still it's called a good place
 

4313
01:29:57,300 --> 01:29:59,689
it's very still it's called a good place
and they reflect a lot on this and you

4314
01:29:59,689 --> 01:29:59,699
and they reflect a lot on this and you
 

4315
01:29:59,699 --> 01:30:02,150
and they reflect a lot on this and you
know the the moral of story is that you

4316
01:30:02,150 --> 01:30:02,160
know the the moral of story is that you
 

4317
01:30:02,160 --> 01:30:05,150
know the the moral of story is that you
have to make the afterlife be finite -

4318
01:30:05,150 --> 01:30:05,160
have to make the afterlife be finite -
 

4319
01:30:05,160 --> 01:30:07,520
have to make the afterlife be finite -
because otherwise people just like

4320
01:30:07,520 --> 01:30:07,530
because otherwise people just like
 

4321
01:30:07,530 --> 01:30:09,820
because otherwise people just like
wall-e

4322
01:30:09,820 --> 01:30:09,830
wall-e
 

4323
01:30:09,830 --> 01:30:13,760
wall-e
so so I think the finance helps but but

4324
01:30:13,760 --> 01:30:13,770
so so I think the finance helps but but
 

4325
01:30:13,770 --> 01:30:14,750
so so I think the finance helps but but
yeah it's just um

4326
01:30:14,750 --> 01:30:14,760
yeah it's just um
 

4327
01:30:14,760 --> 01:30:17,300
yeah it's just um
you know I don't I don't I'm not a

4328
01:30:17,300 --> 01:30:17,310
you know I don't I don't I'm not a
 

4329
01:30:17,310 --> 01:30:20,090
you know I don't I don't I'm not a
religious person I don't think that

4330
01:30:20,090 --> 01:30:20,100
religious person I don't think that
 

4331
01:30:20,100 --> 01:30:22,520
religious person I don't think that
there's something after and so I think

4332
01:30:22,520 --> 01:30:22,530
there's something after and so I think
 

4333
01:30:22,530 --> 01:30:25,729
there's something after and so I think
it just ends and you stop existing and I

4334
01:30:25,729 --> 01:30:25,739
it just ends and you stop existing and I
 

4335
01:30:25,739 --> 01:30:28,010
it just ends and you stop existing and I
really like existing it's just it's such

4336
01:30:28,010 --> 01:30:28,020
really like existing it's just it's such
 

4337
01:30:28,020 --> 01:30:32,300
really like existing it's just it's such
a great privilege to exist that that

4338
01:30:32,300 --> 01:30:32,310
a great privilege to exist that that
 

4339
01:30:32,310 --> 01:30:35,270
a great privilege to exist that that
yeah it's just I think that's very part

4340
01:30:35,270 --> 01:30:35,280
yeah it's just I think that's very part
 

4341
01:30:35,280 --> 01:30:38,180
yeah it's just I think that's very part
I still think that we we like existing

4342
01:30:38,180 --> 01:30:38,190
I still think that we we like existing
 

4343
01:30:38,190 --> 01:30:40,520
I still think that we we like existing
so much because it ends mm-hmm and

4344
01:30:40,520 --> 01:30:40,530
so much because it ends mm-hmm and
 

4345
01:30:40,530 --> 01:30:43,430
so much because it ends mm-hmm and
that's so sad like it's so sad to me

4346
01:30:43,430 --> 01:30:43,440
that's so sad like it's so sad to me
 

4347
01:30:43,440 --> 01:30:45,320
that's so sad like it's so sad to me
every time I got find almost everything

4348
01:30:45,320 --> 01:30:45,330
every time I got find almost everything
 

4349
01:30:45,330 --> 01:30:47,000
every time I got find almost everything

silliest most mundane things are just
 

4353
01:30:48,690 --> 01:30:51,350
silliest most mundane things are just
beautiful and I think I'm cognizant of

4354
01:30:51,350 --> 01:30:51,360
beautiful and I think I'm cognizant of
 

4355
01:30:51,360 --> 01:30:52,610
beautiful and I think I'm cognizant of
the fact that I find it beautiful

4356
01:30:52,610 --> 01:30:52,620
the fact that I find it beautiful
 

4357
01:30:52,620 --> 01:30:57,080
the fact that I find it beautiful

01:31:01,910 --> 01:31:01,920
about that I also feel like there's a
 

4363
01:31:01,920 --> 01:31:05,680
about that I also feel like there's a
lesson in there for robotics an AI that

4364
01:31:05,680 --> 01:31:05,690
lesson in there for robotics an AI that
 

4365
01:31:05,690 --> 01:31:09,530
lesson in there for robotics an AI that
is not like the finite

4366
01:31:09,530 --> 01:31:09,540
is not like the finite
 

4367
01:31:09,540 --> 01:31:11,870
is not like the finite
of things seems to be a fundamental

4368

4375
01:31:19,590 --> 01:31:21,800
Russian and melancholic and romantic or
something but that seems to be a

01:31:21,800 --> 01:31:21,810
something but that seems to be a
 

4377
01:31:21,810 --> 01:31:25,190
something but that seems to be a
fundamental nature of our existence that

4378
01:31:25,190 --> 01:31:25,200
fundamental nature of our existence that
 

4379
01:31:25,200 --> 01:31:28,220
fundamental nature of our existence that
should be incorporated in our reward

4380
01:31:28,220 --> 01:31:28,230
should be incorporated in our reward
 

4381
01:31:28,230 --> 01:31:32,170
should be incorporated in our reward
functions but anyway if you were

4382
01:31:32,170 --> 01:31:32,180
functions but anyway if you were
 

4383
01:31:32,180 --> 01:31:35,000
functions but anyway if you were
speaking of reward functions if you only

4384
01:31:35,000 --> 01:31:35,010
speaking of reward functions if you only
 

4385
01:31:35,010 --> 01:31:37,640
speaking of reward functions if you only
had five years what would you try to

4386
01:31:37,640 --> 01:31:37,650
had five years what would you try to
 

4387
01:31:37,650 --> 01:31:41,300

reward functions let me talk about the
 

4509
01:34:35,520 --> 01:34:38,689
reward functions let me talk about the
the most ridiculous big question what is

purpose happiness meaning you can't even
 

4523
01:34:58,199 --> 01:34:59,540
purpose happiness meaning you can't even
ask that question with a straight face

4524
01:34:59,540 --> 01:34:59,550
ask that question with a straight face
 

4525
01:34:59,550 --> 01:35:01,640
ask that question with a straight face
that's how ridiculous I can't like him

that's how ridiculous I can't like him
 

4527
01:35:01,650 --> 01:35:06,320
that's how ridiculous I can't like him
okay so you know you're gonna try to

4528
01:35:06,320 --> 01:35:06,330
okay so you know you're gonna try to
 

4529
01:35:06,330 --> 01:35:10,879
okay so you know you're gonna try to
answer it anyway aren't you so I was in

4530
01:35:10,879 --> 01:35:10,889
answer it anyway aren't you so I was in
 

4531
01:35:10,889 --> 01:35:15,590
answer it anyway aren't you so I was in
a planetarium once yes and you know they

4532
01:35:15,590 --> 01:35:15,600
a planetarium once yes and you know they
 

4533
01:35:15,600 --> 01:35:17,689
a planetarium once yes and you know they
show you the thing and these do man is

4534
01:35:17,689 --> 01:35:17,699
show you the thing and these do man is
 

4535
01:35:17,699 --> 01:35:18,890
show you the thing and these do man is
zoom out and this whole like you're a

4536
01:35:18,890 --> 01:35:18,900
zoom out and this whole like you're a
 

4537
01:35:18,900 --> 01:35:20,300
zoom out and this whole like you're a
speck of dust kind of thing

4538
01:35:20,300 --> 01:35:20,310
speck of dust kind of thing
 

4539
01:35:20,310 --> 01:35:22,189
speck of dust kind of thing
I think that was conceptualizing that

4540
01:35:22,189 --> 01:35:22,199
I think that was conceptualizing that
 

4541
01:35:22,199 --> 01:35:23,750
I think that was conceptualizing that
we're kind of you know what our humans

4542
01:35:23,750 --> 01:35:23,760
we're kind of you know what our humans
 

4543
01:35:23,760 --> 01:35:25,910
we're kind of you know what our humans
were just on this little planet whatever

4544
01:35:25,910 --> 01:35:25,920
were just on this little planet whatever
 

4545
01:35:25,920 --> 01:35:28,430
were just on this little planet whatever
we don't matter much in the grand scheme

4546
01:35:28,430 --> 01:35:28,440
we don't matter much in the grand scheme
 

4547
01:35:28,440 --> 01:35:31,580
we don't matter much in the grand scheme
of things and then my mind got really

4548
01:35:31,580 --> 01:35:31,590
of things and then my mind got really
 

4549
01:35:31,590 --> 01:35:33,260
of things and then my mind got really
blown cuz this doctor they doctored this

4550
01:35:33,260 --> 01:35:33,270
blown cuz this doctor they doctored this
 

4551
01:35:33,270 --> 01:35:35,330
blown cuz this doctor they doctored this
multi-verse this theory

4552
01:35:35,330 --> 01:35:35,340
multi-verse this theory
 

4553
01:35:35,340 --> 01:35:37,160
multi-verse this theory
where they kind of zoomed out and were

4554
01:35:37,160 --> 01:35:37,170
where they kind of zoomed out and were
 

4555
01:35:37,170 --> 01:35:38,839
where they kind of zoomed out and were
like this is our universe and then like

4556
01:35:38,839 --> 01:35:38,849
like this is our universe and then like
 

4557
01:35:38,849 --> 01:35:40,640
like this is our universe and then like
there's a bazillion other ones and it

4558
01:35:40,640 --> 01:35:40,650
there's a bazillion other ones and it
 

4559
01:35:40,650 --> 01:35:42,560
there's a bazillion other ones and it
stays pop in and out of existence so

4560
01:35:42,560 --> 01:35:42,570
stays pop in and out of existence so
 

4561
01:35:42,570 --> 01:35:44,660
stays pop in and out of existence so
like our whole thing that's that we

4562
01:35:44,660 --> 01:35:44,670
like our whole thing that's that we
 

4563
01:35:44,670 --> 01:35:46,520
like our whole thing that's that we
can't even fathom how big it is was like

4564
01:35:46,520 --> 01:35:46,530
can't even fathom how big it is was like
 

4565
01:35:46,530 --> 01:35:49,129
can't even fathom how big it is was like
a blimp that went in and out and I

4566
01:35:49,129 --> 01:35:49,139
a blimp that went in and out and I
 

4567
01:35:49,139 --> 01:35:55,250
a blimp that went in and out and I
thought I was like okay clearly what we

4568
01:35:55,250 --> 01:35:55,260
thought I was like okay clearly what we
 

4569
01:35:55,260 --> 01:35:57,800
thought I was like okay clearly what we
should be doing is try to impact

4570
01:35:57,800 --> 01:35:57,810
should be doing is try to impact
 

4571
01:35:57,810 --> 01:36:00,020
should be doing is try to impact
whatever local thing we can impact our

4572
01:36:00,020 --> 01:36:00,030
whatever local thing we can impact our
 

4573
01:36:00,030 --> 01:36:01,430
whatever local thing we can impact our
communities leave a little bit behind

4574
01:36:01,430 --> 01:36:01,440
communities leave a little bit behind
 

4575
01:36:01,440 --> 01:36:04,280
communities leave a little bit behind
they're our friends our family our local

4576
01:36:04,280 --> 01:36:04,290
they're our friends our family our local
 

4577
01:36:04,290 --> 01:36:07,609
they're our friends our family our local
communities and just try to be there for

4578
01:36:07,609 --> 01:36:07,619
communities and just try to be there for
 

4579
01:36:07,619 --> 01:36:10,180
communities and just try to be there for
other humans cuz I just

4580
01:36:10,180 --> 01:36:10,190
other humans cuz I just
 

4581
01:36:10,190 --> 01:36:13,040

everything beyond that seems ridiculous
I mean are you like how do you make

4584
01:36:14,899 --> 01:36:14,909
I mean are you like how do you make
 

4585
01:36:14,909 --> 01:36:17,060
I mean are you like how do you make
sense of these multiverses like are you

4586
01:36:17,060 --> 01:36:17,070
sense of these multiverses like are you
 

4587
01:36:17,070 --> 01:36:21,620
sense of these multiverses like are you
inspired by the immensity of it do you

4588
01:36:21,620 --> 01:36:21,630
inspired by the immensity of it do you
 

4589
01:36:21,630 --> 01:36:28,580
inspired by the immensity of it do you
you can it is there like is it amazing

4590
01:36:28,580 --> 01:36:28,590
you can it is there like is it amazing
 

4591
01:36:28,590 --> 01:36:31,640
you can it is there like is it amazing
to you or is it almost paralyzing in

4592
01:36:31,640 --> 01:36:31,650
to you or is it almost paralyzing in
 

4593
01:36:31,650 --> 01:36:34,729
to you or is it almost paralyzing in
this in the mystery of it it's

4594

this in the mystery of it it's
 

4595
01:36:34,739 --> 01:36:38,109
this in the mystery of it it's
frustrating I'm frustrated by my

4596
01:36:38,109 --> 01:36:38,119
frustrating I'm frustrated by my
 

4597
01:36:38,119 --> 01:36:43,160
frustrating I'm frustrated by my
inability to comprehend it feels very

4598
01:36:43,160 --> 01:36:43,170
inability to comprehend it feels very
 

4599
01:36:43,170 --> 01:36:44,750

frustrating it's look there's there's
 

4601
01:36:44,760 --> 01:36:46,790
frustrating it's look there's there's
some stuff that you know we should time

4602
01:36:46,790 --> 01:36:46,800
some stuff that you know we should time
 

4603
01:36:46,800 --> 01:36:48,169
some stuff that you know we should time
blah blah blah that we should really be

amazing physicists of the world have a
 

4611
01:36:55,380 --> 01:36:57,680
amazing physicists of the world have a
much better understanding than me Don

much better understanding than me Don
 

4613
01:36:57,690 --> 01:36:59,750

our brain don't have some fundamental

4618
01:37:04,220 --> 01:37:04,230
our brain don't have some fundamental
 

4619
01:37:04,230 --> 01:37:07,520
our brain don't have some fundamental
capacity yeah well yet or ever I don't

4620
01:37:07,520 --> 01:37:07,530
capacity yeah well yet or ever I don't
 

4621

capacity yeah well yet or ever I don't
know but well this one of the dreams of

01:37:09,830 --> 01:37:09,840
know but well this one of the dreams of
 

4623
01:37:09,840 --> 01:37:11,390
know but well this one of the dreams of
artificial intelligence is to create

4624
01:37:11,390 --> 01:37:11,400
artificial intelligence is to create
 

4625
01:37:11,400 --> 01:37:13,760
artificial intelligence is to create
systems that will aid expand our

4626

systems that will aid expand our
 

4627
01:37:13,770 --> 01:37:15,200
systems that will aid expand our
cognitive capacity in order to

cognitive capacity in order to
 

4629

understand what the heck these
 

4635
01:37:22,369 --> 01:37:26,870
understand what the heck these
multiverses are so I think there's no

4636
01:37:26,870 --> 01:37:26,880
multiverses are so I think there's no
 

4637
01:37:26,880 --> 01:37:28,879
multiverses are so I think there's no
better way to end it than talking about

4638
01:37:28,879 --> 01:37:28,889
better way to end it than talking about
 

4639
01:37:28,889 --> 01:37:30,680
better way to end it than talking about
the meaning of life and the fundamental
