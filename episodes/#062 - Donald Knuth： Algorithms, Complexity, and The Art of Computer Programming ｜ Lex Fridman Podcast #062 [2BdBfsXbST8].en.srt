here's my conversation with Donald Knuth

182
00:03:43,820 --> 00:03:43,830
here's my conversation with Donald Knuth
 

183
00:03:43,830 --> 00:03:50,030
here's my conversation with Donald Knuth
in 1957 atcase tech you were once

184
00:03:50,030 --> 00:03:50,040
in 1957 atcase tech you were once
 

185
00:03:50,040 --> 00:03:53,050
in 1957 atcase tech you were once
allowed to spend several evenings with a

186
00:03:53,050 --> 00:03:53,060
allowed to spend several evenings with a
 

187
00:03:53,060 --> 00:03:56,420
allowed to spend several evenings with a
IBM 650 computer as you've talked about

188
00:03:56,420 --> 00:03:56,430
IBM 650 computer as you've talked about
 

189
00:03:56,430 --> 00:03:57,830
IBM 650 computer as you've talked about
in the past then you fell in love with

190
00:03:57,830 --> 00:03:57,840
in the past then you fell in love with
 

191
00:03:57,840 --> 00:03:59,900
in the past then you fell in love with
computing then

192
00:03:59,900 --> 00:03:59,910
computing then
 

193
00:03:59,910 --> 00:04:02,840
computing then
can you take me back to that moment with

194
00:04:02,840 --> 00:04:02,850
can you take me back to that moment with
 

195
00:04:02,850 --> 00:04:07,640
can you take me back to that moment with
the IBM 650 what was it that grabs you

196
00:04:07,640 --> 00:04:07,650
the IBM 650 what was it that grabs you
 

197
00:04:07,650 --> 00:04:11,690
the IBM 650 what was it that grabs you
about that computer so the IBM 650 was

198
00:04:11,690 --> 00:04:11,700
about that computer so the IBM 650 was
 

199
00:04:11,700 --> 00:04:14,710
about that computer so the IBM 650 was
this this machine that

200
00:04:14,710 --> 00:04:14,720
this this machine that
 

201
00:04:14,720 --> 00:04:17,770
this this machine that
well it didn't fill a room but it it was

202
00:04:17,770 --> 00:04:17,780
well it didn't fill a room but it it was
 

203
00:04:17,780 --> 00:04:21,380
well it didn't fill a room but it it was
it was big and noisy but when I first

204
00:04:21,380 --> 00:04:21,390
it was big and noisy but when I first
 

205
00:04:21,390 --> 00:04:23,360
it was big and noisy but when I first
saw it it was through a window and there

206
00:04:23,360 --> 00:04:23,370
saw it it was through a window and there
 

207
00:04:23,370 --> 00:04:25,040
saw it it was through a window and there
were just a lot of lights flashing on it

208
00:04:25,040 --> 00:04:25,050
were just a lot of lights flashing on it
 

209
00:04:25,050 --> 00:04:32,450
were just a lot of lights flashing on it
and I was a freshman I had a job with

210
00:04:32,450 --> 00:04:32,460
and I was a freshman I had a job with
 

211
00:04:32,460 --> 00:04:35,720
and I was a freshman I had a job with
the statistics group and I was supposed

212
00:04:35,720 --> 00:04:35,730
the statistics group and I was supposed
 

213
00:04:35,730 --> 00:04:38,960
the statistics group and I was supposed
to punch cards and pour data and then

214
00:04:38,960 --> 00:04:38,970
to punch cards and pour data and then
 

215
00:04:38,970 --> 00:04:40,610
to punch cards and pour data and then
sort them on another machine but then

216
00:04:40,610 --> 00:04:40,620
sort them on another machine but then
 

217
00:04:40,620 --> 00:04:44,060
sort them on another machine but then
they got this new computer came in and I

218
00:04:44,060 --> 00:04:44,070
they got this new computer came in and I
 

219
00:04:44,070 --> 00:04:47,510
they got this new computer came in and I
and it had interesting like you know

220
00:04:47,510 --> 00:04:47,520
and it had interesting like you know
 

221
00:04:47,520 --> 00:04:50,780
and it had interesting like you know
lights okay so well but I had it kind of

222
00:04:50,780 --> 00:04:50,790
lights okay so well but I had it kind of
 

223
00:04:50,790 --> 00:04:52,070
lights okay so well but I had it kind of
key to the building so I can you know

224
00:04:52,070 --> 00:04:52,080
key to the building so I can you know
 

225
00:04:52,080 --> 00:04:53,570
key to the building so I can you know
like I could get in and look at it and

226
00:04:53,570 --> 00:04:53,580
like I could get in and look at it and
 

227
00:04:53,580 --> 00:04:56,990
like I could get in and look at it and
got a manual for it and and my first

228
00:04:56,990 --> 00:04:57,000
got a manual for it and and my first
 

229
00:04:57,000 --> 00:04:58,700
got a manual for it and and my first
experience was based on the fact that I

230
00:04:58,700 --> 00:04:58,710
experience was based on the fact that I
 

231
00:04:58,710 --> 00:05:00,770
experience was based on the fact that I
could punch cards basically would you a

232
00:05:00,770 --> 00:05:00,780
could punch cards basically would you a
 

233
00:05:00,780 --> 00:05:02,540
could punch cards basically would you a
big thing for though deal with thick but

234
00:05:02,540 --> 00:05:02,550
big thing for though deal with thick but
 

235
00:05:02,550 --> 00:05:06,560
big thing for though deal with thick but
the is 6:50 was you know big in size but

236
00:05:06,560 --> 00:05:06,570
the is 6:50 was you know big in size but
 

237
00:05:06,570 --> 00:05:12,290
the is 6:50 was you know big in size but
but incredibly small in power in memory

238
00:05:12,290 --> 00:05:12,300
but incredibly small in power in memory
 

239
00:05:12,300 --> 00:05:16,880
but incredibly small in power in memory
it had it had 2,000 words of memory and

240
00:05:16,880 --> 00:05:16,890
it had it had 2,000 words of memory and
 

241
00:05:16,890 --> 00:05:18,830
it had it had 2,000 words of memory and
in a word of memory was 10 decimal

242
00:05:18,830 --> 00:05:18,840
in a word of memory was 10 decimal
 

243
00:05:18,840 --> 00:05:22,880
in a word of memory was 10 decimal
digits plus a sign and it it would do to

244
00:05:22,880 --> 00:05:22,890
digits plus a sign and it it would do to
 

245
00:05:22,890 --> 00:05:24,290
digits plus a sign and it it would do to
add two numbers together you could

246
00:05:24,290 --> 00:05:24,300
add two numbers together you could
 

247
00:05:24,300 --> 00:05:28,460
add two numbers together you could
probably expect that would take oh say

248
00:05:28,460 --> 00:05:28,470
probably expect that would take oh say
 

249
00:05:28,470 --> 00:05:31,370
probably expect that would take oh say
three milliseconds so that's pretty fast

250
00:05:31,370 --> 00:05:31,380
three milliseconds so that's pretty fast
 

251
00:05:31,380 --> 00:05:33,620
three milliseconds so that's pretty fast
it's the memories that constraint the

252
00:05:33,620 --> 00:05:33,630
it's the memories that constraint the
 

253
00:05:33,630 --> 00:05:35,240
it's the memories that constraint the
memories the problem that was why it was

254
00:05:35,240 --> 00:05:35,250
memories the problem that was why it was
 

255
00:05:35,250 --> 00:05:37,970
memories the problem that was why it was
three millisecond because it took five

256
00:05:37,970 --> 00:05:37,980
three millisecond because it took five
 

257
00:05:37,980 --> 00:05:39,560
three millisecond because it took five
milliseconds for the drum to go around

258
00:05:39,560 --> 00:05:39,570
milliseconds for the drum to go around
 

259
00:05:39,570 --> 00:05:43,450
milliseconds for the drum to go around
and you had to wait I don't know five

260
00:05:43,450 --> 00:05:43,460
and you had to wait I don't know five
 

261
00:05:43,460 --> 00:05:46,450
and you had to wait I don't know five
cycle times if you have an instruction

262
00:05:46,450 --> 00:05:46,460
cycle times if you have an instruction
 

263
00:05:46,460 --> 00:05:49,490
cycle times if you have an instruction
one position on the drum then it would

264
00:05:49,490 --> 00:05:49,500
one position on the drum then it would
 

265
00:05:49,500 --> 00:05:50,840
one position on the drum then it would
be ready to read the data for the

266
00:05:50,840 --> 00:05:50,850
be ready to read the data for the
 

267
00:05:50,850 --> 00:05:55,970
be ready to read the data for the
instruction and three notches the drum

268
00:05:55,970 --> 00:05:55,980
instruction and three notches the drum
 

269
00:05:55,980 --> 00:05:58,490
instruction and three notches the drum
is 50 cycles around and you go three

270
00:05:58,490 --> 00:05:58,500
is 50 cycles around and you go three
 

271
00:05:58,500 --> 00:06:00,830
is 50 cycles around and you go three
cycles and you can get the data and then

272
00:06:00,830 --> 00:06:00,840
cycles and you can get the data and then
 

273
00:06:00,840 --> 00:06:02,390
cycles and you can get the data and then
you can go another three cycles and get

00:06:02,390 --> 00:06:02,400
you can go another three cycles and get
 

275
00:06:02,400 --> 00:06:04,790
you can go another three cycles and get
and get to next instruction if the

276
00:06:04,790 --> 00:06:04,800
and get to next instruction if the
 

277
00:06:04,800 --> 00:06:06,500
and get to next instruction if the

you spin until you get to there

280
00:06:08,519 --> 00:06:08,529
you spin until you get to there

you spin until you get to there
play and and we had no random-access

282
00:06:12,029 --> 00:06:12,039
play and and we had no random-access
 

283
00:06:12,039 --> 00:06:13,979

you see here we got fifty words of

286
00:06:16,169 --> 00:06:16,179
you see here we got fifty words of
 

287
00:06:16,179 --> 00:06:17,939
you see here we got fifty words of
random access memory which were which

288

random access memory which were which
 

289
00:06:17,949 --> 00:06:19,949
random access memory which were which
were priceless and we would and we would

were priceless and we would and we would
 

291
00:06:19,959 --> 00:06:23,669
were priceless and we would and we would
move stuff up to the up to the random

292
00:06:23,669 --> 00:06:23,679
move stuff up to the up to the random
 

293
00:06:23,679 --> 00:06:26,909
move stuff up to the up to the random
access memory in 60 word chunks and then

00:06:26,909 --> 00:06:26,919
access memory in 60 word chunks and then
 

295
00:06:26,919 --> 00:06:29,729
access memory in 60 word chunks and then
we would start again so it's separating

296
00:06:29,729 --> 00:06:29,739
we would start again so it's separating
 

297
00:06:29,739 --> 00:06:31,499
we would start again so it's separating
when to go up there and could you have

298
00:06:31,499 --> 00:06:31,509
when to go up there and could you have
 

299
00:06:31,509 --> 00:06:35,669
when to go up there and could you have
predicted the future 60 years later of

300
00:06:35,669 --> 00:06:35,679
predicted the future 60 years later of
 

301
00:06:35,679 --> 00:06:38,399
predicted the future 60 years later of
computing from then you know in fact the

302
00:06:38,399 --> 00:06:38,409
computing from then you know in fact the
 

303
00:06:38,409 --> 00:06:42,139
computing from then you know in fact the
hardest question I was ever asked was

304
00:06:42,139 --> 00:06:42,149

 

305
00:06:42,149 --> 00:06:44,789

what could I have predicted in other

306
00:06:44,789 --> 00:06:44,799
what could I have predicted in other
 

307
00:06:44,799 --> 00:06:47,579
what could I have predicted in other
words the interviewer asked me she said

308
00:06:47,579 --> 00:06:47,589
words the interviewer asked me she said
 

309
00:06:47,589 --> 00:06:50,399
words the interviewer asked me she said
you know what about computing has

310
00:06:50,399 --> 00:06:50,409
you know what about computing has
 

311
00:06:50,409 --> 00:06:51,959
you know what about computing has
surprised you you know and immediately I

312
00:06:51,959 --> 00:06:51,969
surprised you you know and immediately I
 

313
00:06:51,969 --> 00:06:54,539
surprised you you know and immediately I
ran I rattled off a couple dozen things

314
00:06:54,539 --> 00:06:54,549
ran I rattled off a couple dozen things
 

315
00:06:54,549 --> 00:06:56,219
ran I rattled off a couple dozen things
and inches okay so what didn't surprise

316
00:06:56,219 --> 00:06:56,229
and inches okay so what didn't surprise
 

317
00:06:56,229 --> 00:07:00,419
and inches okay so what didn't surprise
and I was I tried for five minutes to

318
00:07:00,419 --> 00:07:00,429
and I was I tried for five minutes to
 

319
00:07:00,429 --> 00:07:01,979
and I was I tried for five minutes to
think of something that I thought I

320
00:07:01,979 --> 00:07:01,989
think of something that I thought I
 

321
00:07:01,989 --> 00:07:03,719
think of something that I thought I
would have predicted and I and I and I

322
00:07:03,719 --> 00:07:03,729
would have predicted and I and I and I
 

323
00:07:03,729 --> 00:07:07,169
would have predicted and I and I and I
couldn't but I let me say that this

324
00:07:07,169 --> 00:07:07,179
couldn't but I let me say that this
 

325
00:07:07,179 --> 00:07:10,229
couldn't but I let me say that this
machine I didn't know well it there

326
00:07:10,229 --> 00:07:10,239
machine I didn't know well it there
 

327
00:07:10,239 --> 00:07:12,299
machine I didn't know well it there
wasn't there wasn't much else in the

328
00:07:12,299 --> 00:07:12,309
wasn't there wasn't much else in the
 

329
00:07:12,309 --> 00:07:14,779
wasn't there wasn't much else in the
world at that time the 650 was the first

330
00:07:14,779 --> 00:07:14,789
world at that time the 650 was the first
 

331
00:07:14,789 --> 00:07:17,249
world at that time the 650 was the first
machine that was that there were more

332
00:07:17,249 --> 00:07:17,259
machine that was that there were more
 

333
00:07:17,259 --> 00:07:19,859
machine that was that there were more
than a thousand of ever before that

334
00:07:19,859 --> 00:07:19,869
than a thousand of ever before that
 

335
00:07:19,869 --> 00:07:22,199
than a thousand of ever before that
there were you know there was each

336
00:07:22,199 --> 00:07:22,209
there were you know there was each
 

337
00:07:22,209 --> 00:07:23,939
there were you know there was each
machine there might be a half a dozen

338
00:07:23,939 --> 00:07:23,949
machine there might be a half a dozen
 

339
00:07:23,949 --> 00:07:26,989
machine there might be a half a dozen
examples maybe my first mass-market

340
00:07:26,989 --> 00:07:26,999
examples maybe my first mass-market
 

341
00:07:26,999 --> 00:07:30,089
examples maybe my first mass-market
mass-produced the first one yeah done in

342
00:07:30,089 --> 00:07:30,099
mass-produced the first one yeah done in
 

343
00:07:30,099 --> 00:07:35,579
mass-produced the first one yeah done in
quantity and and IBM I didn't sell them

344
00:07:35,579 --> 00:07:35,589
quantity and and IBM I didn't sell them
 

345
00:07:35,589 --> 00:07:38,009
quantity and and IBM I didn't sell them
they they rented them but but they they

346
00:07:38,009 --> 00:07:38,019
they they rented them but but they they
 

347
00:07:38,019 --> 00:07:40,379
they they rented them but but they they
rented them to universities that at

348
00:07:40,379 --> 00:07:40,389
rented them to universities that at
 

349
00:07:40,389 --> 00:07:44,399
rented them to universities that at
great you know I had a great deal and

350
00:07:44,399 --> 00:07:44,409
great you know I had a great deal and
 

351
00:07:44,409 --> 00:07:48,059
great you know I had a great deal and
and so that's why a lot of students

352
00:07:48,059 --> 00:07:48,069
and so that's why a lot of students
 

353
00:07:48,069 --> 00:07:51,719
and so that's why a lot of students
learned about computers at that time so

354
00:07:51,719 --> 00:07:51,729
learned about computers at that time so
 

355
00:07:51,729 --> 00:07:54,889
learned about computers at that time so
you refer to people including yourself

00:08:02,099 --> 00:08:02,109
least I've heard you used that
 

363
00:08:02,109 --> 00:08:05,009

terminology it true that I think there's

364
00:08:05,009 --> 00:08:05,019
terminology it true that I think there's
 

365
00:08:05,019 --> 00:08:07,589
terminology it true that I think there's
something that happened to me as I was

00:08:07,589 --> 00:08:07,599
something that happened to me as I was
 

367
00:08:07,599 --> 00:08:10,949
something that happened to me as I was
growing up that made my brain structure

368
00:08:10,949 --> 00:08:10,959
growing up that made my brain structure
 

369
00:08:10,959 --> 00:08:12,779
growing up that made my brain structure
in a certain way that resonates with

in a certain way that resonates with
 

371
00:08:12,789 --> 00:08:15,209
in a certain way that resonates with
with computers so there's the space of

00:08:15,209 --> 00:08:15,219
with computers so there's the space of
 

373
00:08:15,219 --> 00:08:17,699
with computers so there's the space of
people it's 2% of the population you

00:08:23,830 --> 00:08:23,840
it's been proven fairly constant over
 

379
00:08:23,840 --> 00:08:27,610
it's been proven fairly constant over
most of my career however it might be

00:08:27,610 --> 00:08:27,620
most of my career however it might be
 

381
00:08:27,620 --> 00:08:28,929
most of my career however it might be
different now because kids have

382
00:08:28,929 --> 00:08:28,939
different now because kids have
 

383
00:08:28,939 --> 00:08:30,399
different now because kids have
different experiences when they're young

384
00:08:30,399 --> 00:08:30,409
different experiences when they're young

so what does the world look like to a

386
00:08:34,630 --> 00:08:34,640
so what does the world look like to a
 

387
00:08:34,640 --> 00:08:38,589
so what does the world look like to a
geek what is what is this aspect of

388
00:08:38,589 --> 00:08:38,599
geek what is what is this aspect of
 

389
00:08:38,599 --> 00:08:42,730
geek what is what is this aspect of
thinking that is unique to their makes

390
00:08:42,730 --> 00:08:42,740
thinking that is unique to their makes
 

391
00:08:42,740 --> 00:08:47,980
thinking that is unique to their makes
it yeah that makes a geek this is cuter

392
00:08:47,980 --> 00:08:47,990
it yeah that makes a geek this is cuter
 

393
00:08:47,990 --> 00:08:51,569
it yeah that makes a geek this is cuter
the important question in in the 50s

394
00:08:51,569 --> 00:08:51,579
the important question in in the 50s
 

395
00:08:51,579 --> 00:08:57,460
the important question in in the 50s
IBM noticed that that there were geeks

396
00:08:57,460 --> 00:08:57,470
IBM noticed that that there were geeks
 

397
00:08:57,470 --> 00:08:59,110
IBM noticed that that there were geeks
and non geeks and so they tried to hire

398
00:08:59,110 --> 00:08:59,120
and non geeks and so they tried to hire
 

399
00:08:59,120 --> 00:09:01,300
and non geeks and so they tried to hire
geeks and they put out as worth papers

400
00:09:01,300 --> 00:09:01,310
geeks and they put out as worth papers
 

401
00:09:01,310 --> 00:09:03,400
geeks and they put out as worth papers

or something like this they were they

406
00:09:06,460 --> 00:09:06,470
or something like this they were they
 

407
00:09:06,470 --> 00:09:08,500
or something like this they were they
were trying for some things so what it

408
00:09:08,500 --> 00:09:08,510
were trying for some things so what it
 

409
00:09:08,510 --> 00:09:11,560
were trying for some things so what it
what what is it that I find easy and

410
00:09:11,560 --> 00:09:11,570
what what is it that I find easy and
 

411
00:09:11,570 --> 00:09:14,980
what what is it that I find easy and
other people tend to find harder and and

I think there's two main things one is
 

415
00:09:17,959 --> 00:09:23,019
I think there's two main things one is
this with is ability to jump jump levels

416
00:09:23,019 --> 00:09:23,029
this with is ability to jump jump levels
 

417
00:09:23,029 --> 00:09:27,970
this with is ability to jump jump levels
of abstraction so you see something in

418
00:09:27,970 --> 00:09:27,980
of abstraction so you see something in
 

419
00:09:27,980 --> 00:09:30,730
of abstraction so you see something in
the large and you see something in the

420
00:09:30,730 --> 00:09:30,740
the large and you see something in the
 

421
00:09:30,740 --> 00:09:34,740
the large and you see something in the
small and and can you pass between those

422
00:09:34,740 --> 00:09:34,750
small and and can you pass between those
 

423
00:09:34,750 --> 00:09:37,269
small and and can you pass between those
unconsciously so you know that in order

424
00:09:37,269 --> 00:09:37,279
unconsciously so you know that in order
 

425
00:09:37,279 --> 00:09:40,990
unconsciously so you know that in order
to solve some big problem what you need

426
00:09:40,990 --> 00:09:41,000
to solve some big problem what you need
 

427
00:09:41,000 --> 00:09:44,110
to solve some big problem what you need
to do is add one to a into a certain

428
00:09:44,110 --> 00:09:44,120
to do is add one to a into a certain
 

429
00:09:44,120 --> 00:09:46,150
to do is add one to a into a certain
register or anything that gets you to

430
00:09:46,150 --> 00:09:46,160
register or anything that gets you to
 

431
00:09:46,160 --> 00:09:48,430
register or anything that gets you to
another step and you can and we and

432
00:09:48,430 --> 00:09:48,440
another step and you can and we and
 

433
00:09:48,440 --> 00:09:50,410
another step and you can and we and
below the yeah I mean I don't go down to

434
00:09:50,410 --> 00:09:50,420
below the yeah I mean I don't go down to
 

435
00:09:50,420 --> 00:09:53,019
below the yeah I mean I don't go down to
the electron level but I knew what those

436
00:09:53,019 --> 00:09:53,029
the electron level but I knew what those
 

437
00:09:53,029 --> 00:09:55,090
the electron level but I knew what those
milliseconds were what the drum was like

438
00:09:55,090 --> 00:09:55,100
milliseconds were what the drum was like
 

439
00:09:55,100 --> 00:09:58,990
milliseconds were what the drum was like
on the 650 I knew how I was gonna factor

440
00:09:58,990 --> 00:09:59,000
on the 650 I knew how I was gonna factor
 

441
00:09:59,000 --> 00:10:01,389
on the 650 I knew how I was gonna factor
her number or or find a root of an

of what was doing and and as I'm

446
00:10:05,439 --> 00:10:05,449
of what was doing and and as I'm
 

447
00:10:05,449 --> 00:10:08,620
of what was doing and and as I'm
debugging I'm going through you know did

448
00:10:08,620 --> 00:10:08,630
debugging I'm going through you know did
 

449
00:10:08,630 --> 00:10:12,040
debugging I'm going through you know did
I make a key punch err did I did I write

450
00:10:12,040 --> 00:10:12,050
I make a key punch err did I did I write
 

451
00:10:12,050 --> 00:10:13,569
I make a key punch err did I did I write
the wrong instruction do I have the

452
00:10:13,569 --> 00:10:13,579
the wrong instruction do I have the
 

453
00:10:13,579 --> 00:10:16,630
the wrong instruction do I have the
wrong wrong thing in a register and each

454
00:10:16,630 --> 00:10:16,640
wrong wrong thing in a register and each
 

455
00:10:16,640 --> 00:10:20,560
wrong wrong thing in a register and each
level at each level it is different and

456
00:10:20,560 --> 00:10:20,570
level at each level it is different and
 

457
00:10:20,570 --> 00:10:23,980
level at each level it is different and
so this idea of being able to see

458
00:10:23,980 --> 00:10:23,990
so this idea of being able to see
 

459
00:10:23,990 --> 00:10:27,579
so this idea of being able to see
something at all at lots of levels and

460
00:10:27,579 --> 00:10:27,589
something at all at lots of levels and
 

461
00:10:27,589 --> 00:10:30,550
something at all at lots of levels and
fluently go between them it seems to me

462
00:10:30,550 --> 00:10:30,560
fluently go between them it seems to me
 

463
00:10:30,560 --> 00:10:32,319
fluently go between them it seems to me
to be more pronounced much more

464
00:10:32,319 --> 00:10:32,329
to be more pronounced much more
 

465
00:10:32,329 --> 00:10:34,800
to be more pronounced much more
pronounced in in the people that

466
00:10:34,800 --> 00:10:34,810
pronounced in in the people that
 

467
00:10:34,810 --> 00:10:38,280
pronounced in in the people that
with computers like I got so in my books

468
00:10:38,280 --> 00:10:38,290
with computers like I got so in my books
 

469
00:10:38,290 --> 00:10:41,760
with computers like I got so in my books
I also don't stick after the high level

470
00:10:41,760 --> 00:10:41,770
I also don't stick after the high level
 

471
00:10:41,770 --> 00:10:47,790
I also don't stick after the high level
but but i but i mix low level stuff with

472
00:10:47,790 --> 00:10:47,800
but but i but i mix low level stuff with
 

473
00:10:47,800 --> 00:10:50,580
but but i but i mix low level stuff with
high level and this means that some

475
00:10:50,590 --> 00:10:54,810
high level and this means that some
people think you know that I that I

476

should write better books and it's

478
00:10:57,390 --> 00:10:57,400
should write better books and it's
 

479
00:10:57,400 --> 00:11:00,480
should write better books and it's
probably true but but other people say

480
00:11:00,480 --> 00:11:00,490
probably true but but other people say
 

481
00:11:00,490 --> 00:11:03,450
probably true but but other people say
well but that's if you think like like

482
00:11:03,450 --> 00:11:03,460
well but that's if you think like like
 

483
00:11:03,460 --> 00:11:04,740
well but that's if you think like like
that then that's the way to train

484
00:11:04,740 --> 00:11:04,750
that then that's the way to train
 

485
00:11:04,750 --> 00:11:06,780
that then that's the way to train
yourself like to keep mixing the levels

486
00:11:06,780 --> 00:11:06,790
yourself like to keep mixing the levels
 

487
00:11:06,790 --> 00:11:10,019
yourself like to keep mixing the levels
and and learn more and more how to jump

488
00:11:10,019 --> 00:11:10,029
and and learn more and more how to jump
 

489
00:11:10,029 --> 00:11:11,550
and and learn more and more how to jump
between so that that's the one thing the

490
00:11:11,550 --> 00:11:11,560
between so that that's the one thing the
 

491
00:11:11,560 --> 00:11:14,370
between so that that's the one thing the
other the other thing is that it's more

492
00:11:14,370 --> 00:11:14,380
other the other thing is that it's more
 

493
00:11:14,380 --> 00:11:19,880
other the other thing is that it's more
of a talent it to be able to deal with

00:11:19,880 --> 00:11:19,890
of a talent it to be able to deal with

of a talent it to be able to deal with
non-uniformity where there's case one

everything so if so it doesn't bother me

502
00:11:32,970 --> 00:11:32,980
everything so if so it doesn't bother me
 

503
00:11:32,980 --> 00:11:37,560
everything so if so it doesn't bother me
if I need like an algorithm has ten

00:11:37,560 --> 00:11:37,570
if I need like an algorithm has ten
 

505
00:11:37,570 --> 00:11:39,630
if I need like an algorithm has ten
steps to it you know each step is does

506
00:11:39,630 --> 00:11:39,640
steps to it you know each step is does
 

507
00:11:39,640 --> 00:11:40,950

but a lot of a lot of pure mathematics

510
00:11:43,740 --> 00:11:43,750
but a lot of a lot of pure mathematics
 

511
00:11:43,750 --> 00:11:45,990
but a lot of a lot of pure mathematics
is based on one or two rules which which

is based on one or two rules which which
 

513
00:11:46,000 --> 00:11:49,590
is based on one or two rules which which
are universal and and and so this means

514
00:11:49,590 --> 00:11:49,600
are universal and and and so this means
 

515
00:11:49,600 --> 00:11:52,290
are universal and and and so this means

Torrie I I think he had yeah a lot more

534
00:12:17,790 --> 00:12:17,800

and so I didn't know that aspect of him

544
00:12:38,010 --> 00:12:38,020
and so I didn't know that aspect of him
 

545

has undergraduate we had a class that
 

549

has undergraduate we had a class that
talked about computability theory and

550
00:12:45,900 --> 00:12:45,910
talked about computability theory and
 

551
00:12:45,910 --> 00:12:49,470
talked about computability theory and
Turing machines and and that was all it

552
00:12:49,470 --> 00:12:49,480
Turing machines and and that was all it
 

553
00:12:49,480 --> 00:12:52,320
Turing machines and and that was all it
sounded like a very specific kind of

sounded like a very specific kind of
 

555
00:12:52,330 --> 00:12:55,590
sounded like a very specific kind of
purely theoretical approach to stuff

00:13:22,590 --> 00:13:22,600
he was a real hacker that that he had
 

571
00:13:22,600 --> 00:13:23,400
he was a real hacker that that he had

absolutely so how do you see those two

624
00:14:45,769 --> 00:14:45,779
absolutely so how do you see those two
 

625
00:14:45,779 --> 00:14:48,259
absolutely so how do you see those two
as conflicting as the formalism of

so I I don't I don't read literature

796
00:19:04,080 --> 00:19:04,090
so I I don't I don't read literature
 

797
00:19:04,090 --> 00:19:07,350
so I I don't I don't read literature
because it's supposed to be good for me

00:19:07,350 --> 00:19:07,360
because it's supposed to be good for me
 

799
00:19:07,360 --> 00:19:09,840
because it's supposed to be good for me
or because somebody said it's great but

James Bond so like I love Ian Fleming I

806
00:19:20,490 --> 00:19:20,500
James Bond so like I love Ian Fleming I
 

807
00:19:20,500 --> 00:19:22,920
James Bond so like I love Ian Fleming I
think he's got a he had a really great

00:19:26,050 --> 00:19:28,350
gift for if he has a golf game or game
of bridge or something and this comes

812
00:19:28,350 --> 00:19:28,360
of bridge or something and this comes
 

813
00:19:28,360 --> 00:19:30,240
of bridge or something and this comes
into a story it'll it'll be the most

814
00:19:30,240 --> 00:19:30,250
into a story it'll it'll be the most
 

815
00:19:30,250 --> 00:19:33,870
into a story it'll it'll be the most
exciting golf game or or you know the

816
00:19:33,870 --> 00:19:33,880
exciting golf game or or you know the
 

817
00:19:33,880 --> 00:19:36,900
exciting golf game or or you know the
absolute best possible hands a bridge

818
00:19:36,900 --> 00:19:36,910
absolute best possible hands a bridge
 

819
00:19:36,910 --> 00:19:41,970
absolute best possible hands a bridge
that that exists and and any he exploits

820
00:19:41,970 --> 00:19:41,980
that that exists and and any he exploits
 

821
00:19:41,980 --> 00:19:45,810
that that exists and and any he exploits
it and tells it beautifully as well so

822
00:19:45,810 --> 00:19:45,820
it and tells it beautifully as well so
 

823
00:19:45,820 --> 00:19:49,920
it and tells it beautifully as well so
in connecting some things here looking

824
00:19:49,920 --> 00:19:49,930
in connecting some things here looking
 

825
00:19:49,930 --> 00:19:51,750
in connecting some things here looking
at literate programming and being able

826
00:19:51,750 --> 00:19:51,760
at literate programming and being able
 

827
00:19:51,760 --> 00:19:59,130
at literate programming and being able
to it convey encode algorithms to a

828
00:19:59,130 --> 00:19:59,140
to it convey encode algorithms to a
 

829
00:19:59,140 --> 00:20:03,330
to it convey encode algorithms to a
computer in a way that mimics how humans

830
00:20:03,330 --> 00:20:03,340
computer in a way that mimics how humans
 

831
00:20:03,340 --> 00:20:06,780
computer in a way that mimics how humans
speak how what do you think about

832
00:20:06,780 --> 00:20:06,790
speak how what do you think about
 

833
00:20:06,790 --> 00:20:08,820
speak how what do you think about
natural language in general and the

834
00:20:08,820 --> 00:20:08,830
natural language in general and the
 

835
00:20:08,830 --> 00:20:11,730
natural language in general and the
messiness of our human world about

836
00:20:11,730 --> 00:20:11,740
messiness of our human world about
 

837
00:20:11,740 --> 00:20:14,730
messiness of our human world about
trying to express yeah difficult things

838
00:20:14,730 --> 00:20:14,740
trying to express yeah difficult things
 

839
00:20:14,740 --> 00:20:17,790
trying to express yeah difficult things
so the idea of literate programming is

840
00:20:17,790 --> 00:20:17,800
so the idea of literate programming is
 

841
00:20:17,800 --> 00:20:24,540
so the idea of literate programming is
to is really to try to understand

842
00:20:24,540 --> 00:20:24,550
to is really to try to understand
 

843
00:20:24,550 --> 00:20:26,790
to is really to try to understand
something better by seeing it from these

844
00:20:26,790 --> 00:20:26,800
something better by seeing it from these
 

845
00:20:26,800 --> 00:20:28,740
something better by seeing it from these
two perspectives the formal and the

846
00:20:28,740 --> 00:20:28,750
two perspectives the formal and the
 

847
00:20:28,750 --> 00:20:31,020
two perspectives the formal and the
informal if we try to understand a

848
00:20:31,020 --> 00:20:31,030
informal if we try to understand a
 

849
00:20:31,030 --> 00:20:33,570
informal if we try to understand a
complicated thing if we can look at it

850
00:20:33,570 --> 00:20:33,580
complicated thing if we can look at it
 

851
00:20:33,580 --> 00:20:36,360
complicated thing if we can look at it
in different ways and so this is in fact

852
00:20:36,360 --> 00:20:36,370
in different ways and so this is in fact
 

853
00:20:36,370 --> 00:20:39,150
in different ways and so this is in fact
the key to technical writing a good

854
00:20:39,150 --> 00:20:39,160
the key to technical writing a good
 

855
00:20:39,160 --> 00:20:40,260
the key to technical writing a good
technical writer

856
00:20:40,260 --> 00:20:40,270
technical writer
 

857
00:20:40,270 --> 00:20:42,630
technical writer
try not to be obvious about it but says

858
00:20:42,630 --> 00:20:42,640
try not to be obvious about it but says
 

859
00:20:42,640 --> 00:20:45,600
try not to be obvious about it but says
everything twice formally and informally

860
00:20:45,600 --> 00:20:45,610
everything twice formally and informally
 

861
00:20:45,610 --> 00:20:48,680
everything twice formally and informally
or maybe three times but you try to give

862
00:20:48,680 --> 00:20:48,690
or maybe three times but you try to give
 

863
00:20:48,690 --> 00:20:55,440
or maybe three times but you try to give
the reader a way to put the concept into

864
00:20:55,440 --> 00:20:55,450
the reader a way to put the concept into
 

865
00:20:55,450 --> 00:20:57,960
the reader a way to put the concept into
his own brain or her own brain is that

866
00:20:57,960 --> 00:20:57,970
his own brain or her own brain is that
 

867
00:20:57,970 --> 00:21:00,540
his own brain or her own brain is that
better for the writer or the reader or

868
00:21:00,540 --> 00:21:00,550
better for the writer or the reader or
 

869
00:21:00,550 --> 00:21:05,240
better for the writer or the reader or
both well the writer just tries to

870
00:21:05,240 --> 00:21:05,250
both well the writer just tries to
 

871
00:21:05,250 --> 00:21:07,560
both well the writer just tries to
understand the reader that's the goal of

872
00:21:07,560 --> 00:21:07,570
understand the reader that's the goal of
 

873
00:21:07,570 --> 00:21:10,410
understand the reader that's the goal of
a writer is to have a good mental image

874
00:21:10,410 --> 00:21:10,420
a writer is to have a good mental image
 

875
00:21:10,420 --> 00:21:13,740
a writer is to have a good mental image
of the reader and to say what the reader

876
00:21:13,740 --> 00:21:13,750
of the reader and to say what the reader
 

877
00:21:13,750 --> 00:21:18,330
of the reader and to say what the reader
expects next and to to impress the

878
00:21:18,330 --> 00:21:18,340
expects next and to to impress the
 

879
00:21:18,340 --> 00:21:19,950
expects next and to to impress the
reader with what has impressed the

880
00:21:19,950 --> 00:21:19,960
reader with what has impressed the
 

881
00:21:19,960 --> 00:21:24,600
reader with what has impressed the
writer why something is interesting so

882
00:21:24,600 --> 00:21:24,610
writer why something is interesting so
 

883
00:21:24,610 --> 00:21:26,400
writer why something is interesting so
when you have a computer program we try

884
00:21:26,400 --> 00:21:26,410
when you have a computer program we try
 

885
00:21:26,410 --> 00:21:29,220
when you have a computer program we try
to instead of looking at it as something

886
00:21:29,220 --> 00:21:29,230
to instead of looking at it as something
 

887
00:21:29,230 --> 00:21:30,630
to instead of looking at it as something
that we're just trying to give an

888
00:21:30,630 --> 00:21:30,640
that we're just trying to give an
 

889
00:21:30,640 --> 00:21:32,130
that we're just trying to give an
instruction to the computer what we

890
00:21:32,130 --> 00:21:32,140
instruction to the computer what we
 

891
00:21:32,140 --> 00:21:35,040
instruction to the computer what we
really want to be is giving giving

892
00:21:35,040 --> 00:21:35,050
really want to be is giving giving
 

893
00:21:35,050 --> 00:21:39,330
really want to be is giving giving
insight to the person who's who's gonna

894
00:21:39,330 --> 00:21:39,340
insight to the person who's who's gonna
 

895
00:21:39,340 --> 00:21:41,640
insight to the person who's who's gonna
be maintaining this program or to the

896
00:21:41,640 --> 00:21:41,650
be maintaining this program or to the
 

897
00:21:41,650 --> 00:21:44,370
be maintaining this program or to the
programmer himself when he's debugging

898
00:21:44,370 --> 00:21:44,380
programmer himself when he's debugging
 

899
00:21:44,380 --> 00:21:46,800
programmer himself when he's debugging
it as to why this stuff is being done

900
00:21:46,800 --> 00:21:46,810
it as to why this stuff is being done
 

901
00:21:46,810 --> 00:21:50,550
it as to why this stuff is being done
and so all the techniques of exposition

902
00:21:50,550 --> 00:21:50,560
and so all the techniques of exposition
 

903
00:21:50,560 --> 00:21:54,210
and so all the techniques of exposition
that a teacher uses or book writers make

904
00:21:54,210 --> 00:21:54,220
that a teacher uses or book writers make
 

905
00:21:54,220 --> 00:21:56,040
that a teacher uses or book writers make
you better program or if your if your

906
00:21:56,040 --> 00:21:56,050
you better program or if your if your
 

907
00:21:56,050 --> 00:21:59,160
you better program or if your if your
program is going to be not just a

908
00:21:59,160 --> 00:21:59,170
program is going to be not just a
 

909
00:21:59,170 --> 00:22:03,810
program is going to be not just a
one-shot deal so how difficult is that

910
00:22:03,810 --> 00:22:03,820
one-shot deal so how difficult is that
 

911
00:22:03,820 --> 00:22:07,760
one-shot deal so how difficult is that
do you see hope for the combination of

912
00:22:07,760 --> 00:22:07,770
do you see hope for the combination of
 

913
00:22:07,770 --> 00:22:11,280
do you see hope for the combination of
informal and formal for the programming

914
00:22:11,280 --> 00:22:11,290
informal and formal for the programming
 

915
00:22:11,290 --> 00:22:14,940
informal and formal for the programming
task yeah I I'm the wrong person to ask

916
00:22:14,940 --> 00:22:14,950
task yeah I I'm the wrong person to ask
 

917
00:22:14,950 --> 00:22:17,580
task yeah I I'm the wrong person to ask
I guess because I'm a geek but but I

918
00:22:17,580 --> 00:22:17,590
I guess because I'm a geek but but I
 

919
00:22:17,590 --> 00:22:19,320
I guess because I'm a geek but but I
think for a geek it's easy I don't know

920
00:22:19,320 --> 00:22:19,330
think for a geek it's easy I don't know
 

921
00:22:19,330 --> 00:22:23,700
think for a geek it's easy I don't know
I don't know see not some people have

922
00:22:23,700 --> 00:22:23,710
I don't know see not some people have
 

923
00:22:23,710 --> 00:22:26,910
I don't know see not some people have
difficulty writing and that might be

924
00:22:26,910 --> 00:22:26,920
difficulty writing and that might be
 

925
00:22:26,920 --> 00:22:29,790
difficulty writing and that might be
because there's something in their brain

926
00:22:29,790 --> 00:22:29,800
because there's something in their brain
 

927
00:22:29,800 --> 00:22:32,190
because there's something in their brain
structure that makes it hard for them to

928
00:22:32,190 --> 00:22:32,200
structure that makes it hard for them to
 

929
00:22:32,200 --> 00:22:34,320
structure that makes it hard for them to
write or or it might be something just

930
00:22:34,320 --> 00:22:34,330
write or or it might be something just
 

931
00:22:34,330 --> 00:22:35,660
write or or it might be something just
that they haven't had enough practice

932
00:22:35,660 --> 00:22:35,670
that they haven't had enough practice
 

933
00:22:35,670 --> 00:22:39,540
that they haven't had enough practice
I'm not the right one to to uh to judge

934
00:22:39,540 --> 00:22:39,550
I'm not the right one to to uh to judge
 

935
00:22:39,550 --> 00:22:42,000
I'm not the right one to to uh to judge
but I don't think you teach any person

936
00:22:42,000 --> 00:22:42,010
but I don't think you teach any person
 

937
00:22:42,010 --> 00:22:45,210
but I don't think you teach any person
any particular skill like I do think

938
00:22:45,210 --> 00:22:45,220
any particular skill like I do think
 

939
00:22:45,220 --> 00:22:49,260
any particular skill like I do think
that that writing is is half of my life

940
00:22:49,260 --> 00:22:49,270
that that writing is is half of my life
 

941
00:22:49,270 --> 00:22:51,799
that that writing is is half of my life
and so I put it together and let

942
00:22:51,799 --> 00:22:51,809
and so I put it together and let
 

943
00:22:51,809 --> 00:22:53,899
and so I put it together and let
program he won't even when I'm writing a

944
00:22:53,899 --> 00:22:53,909
program he won't even when I'm writing a
 

945
00:22:53,909 --> 00:22:58,119
program he won't even when I'm writing a
one-shot program I I write it in

946
00:22:58,119 --> 00:22:58,129
one-shot program I I write it in
 

947
00:22:58,129 --> 00:23:02,289
one-shot program I I write it in
literate way because I get it right

948
00:23:02,289 --> 00:23:02,299
literate way because I get it right
 

949
00:23:02,299 --> 00:23:05,930
literate way because I get it right
faster though now does it get compiled

950
00:23:05,930 --> 00:23:05,940
faster though now does it get compiled
 

951
00:23:05,940 --> 00:23:09,349
faster though now does it get compiled
automatically or so I guess on the

952
00:23:09,349 --> 00:23:09,359
automatically or so I guess on the
 

953
00:23:09,359 --> 00:23:12,169
automatically or so I guess on the
technical side my question was how

954
00:23:12,169 --> 00:23:12,179
technical side my question was how
 

955
00:23:12,179 --> 00:23:15,070
technical side my question was how
difficult is a design a system where

956
00:23:15,070 --> 00:23:15,080
difficult is a design a system where
 

957
00:23:15,080 --> 00:23:17,060
difficult is a design a system where
much of the programming is done

958
00:23:17,060 --> 00:23:17,070
much of the programming is done
 

959
00:23:17,070 --> 00:23:21,639
much of the programming is done
informally informally yeah informally I

960
00:23:21,639 --> 00:23:21,649
informally informally yeah informally I
 

961
00:23:21,649 --> 00:23:25,159
informally informally yeah informally I
think whatever works to make it

962
00:23:25,159 --> 00:23:25,169
think whatever works to make it
 

963
00:23:25,169 --> 00:23:28,940
think whatever works to make it
understandable is good but then you have

964
00:23:28,940 --> 00:23:28,950
understandable is good but then you have
 

965
00:23:28,950 --> 00:23:33,560
understandable is good but then you have
to also understand how informal is you

966
00:23:33,560 --> 00:23:33,570
to also understand how informal is you
 

967
00:23:33,570 --> 00:23:35,149
to also understand how informal is you
have to know the limitations you have to

968
00:23:35,149 --> 00:23:35,159
have to know the limitations you have to
 

969
00:23:35,159 --> 00:23:38,479
have to know the limitations you have to
connect so so by putting the formula and

970
00:23:38,479 --> 00:23:38,489
connect so so by putting the formula and
 

971
00:23:38,489 --> 00:23:41,589
connect so so by putting the formula and
informal together this this is where

972
00:23:41,589 --> 00:23:41,599
informal together this this is where
 

973
00:23:41,599 --> 00:23:43,909
informal together this this is where
this is where it gets locked into your

974
00:23:43,909 --> 00:23:43,919
this is where it gets locked into your
 

975
00:23:43,919 --> 00:23:48,129
this is where it gets locked into your
into your brain now you can you can say

976
00:23:48,129 --> 00:23:48,139
into your brain now you can you can say
 

977
00:23:48,139 --> 00:23:51,229
into your brain now you can you can say
informally well I'm working on a problem

978
00:23:51,229 --> 00:23:51,239
informally well I'm working on a problem
 

979
00:23:51,239 --> 00:23:54,349
informally well I'm working on a problem
right now so let's go there I get that

980
00:23:54,349 --> 00:23:54,359
right now so let's go there I get that
 

981
00:23:54,359 --> 00:23:57,649
right now so let's go there I get that
can you give me an example of of

982
00:23:57,649 --> 00:23:57,659
can you give me an example of of
 

983
00:23:57,659 --> 00:23:59,329
can you give me an example of of
connecting the informal in the formal

984
00:23:59,329 --> 00:23:59,339
connecting the informal in the formal
 

985
00:23:59,339 --> 00:24:02,180
connecting the informal in the formal
well it's a little too complicated an

986
00:24:02,180 --> 00:24:02,190
well it's a little too complicated an
 

987
00:24:02,190 --> 00:24:05,029
well it's a little too complicated an
example there's a puzzle that that's

988
00:24:05,029 --> 00:24:05,039
example there's a puzzle that that's
 

989
00:24:05,039 --> 00:24:07,940
example there's a puzzle that that's
self referential it's called a Japanese

990
00:24:07,940 --> 00:24:07,950
self referential it's called a Japanese
 

991
00:24:07,950 --> 00:24:11,389
self referential it's called a Japanese
arrow puzzle and and and you're given a

992
00:24:11,389 --> 00:24:11,399
arrow puzzle and and and you're given a
 

993
00:24:11,399 --> 00:24:14,539
arrow puzzle and and and you're given a
a bunch of boxes each one points north

994
00:24:14,539 --> 00:24:14,549
a bunch of boxes each one points north
 

995
00:24:14,549 --> 00:24:18,109
a bunch of boxes each one points north
east south or west and at the end you're

996
00:24:18,109 --> 00:24:18,119
east south or west and at the end you're
 

997
00:24:18,119 --> 00:24:19,999
east south or west and at the end you're
supposed to fill in each box with the

998
00:24:19,999 --> 00:24:20,009
supposed to fill in each box with the
 

999
00:24:20,009 --> 00:24:23,810
supposed to fill in each box with the
number of distinct numbers that it

1000
00:24:23,810 --> 00:24:23,820
number of distinct numbers that it
 

1001
00:24:23,820 --> 00:24:26,779
number of distinct numbers that it
points to so if I put a three in a box

1002
00:24:26,779 --> 00:24:26,789
points to so if I put a three in a box
 

1003
00:24:26,789 --> 00:24:28,999
points to so if I put a three in a box
that means that and it's pointing to

1004
00:24:28,999 --> 00:24:29,009
that means that and it's pointing to
 

1005
00:24:29,009 --> 00:24:30,680
that means that and it's pointing to
five other boxes that means that there's

1006
00:24:30,680 --> 00:24:30,690
five other boxes that means that there's
 

1007
00:24:30,690 --> 00:24:32,239
five other boxes that means that there's
going to be three different numbers in

1008
00:24:32,239 --> 00:24:32,249
going to be three different numbers in
 

1009
00:24:32,249 --> 00:24:36,079
going to be three different numbers in
those five bucks and and those boxes are

1010
00:24:36,079 --> 00:24:36,089
those five bucks and and those boxes are
 

1011
00:24:36,089 --> 00:24:38,119
those five bucks and and those boxes are
pointing what I might be pointing to me

1012
00:24:38,119 --> 00:24:38,129
pointing what I might be pointing to me
 

1013
00:24:38,129 --> 00:24:39,499
pointing what I might be pointing to me
one of my might be pointing the other

1014
00:24:39,499 --> 00:24:39,509
one of my might be pointing the other
 

1015
00:24:39,509 --> 00:24:44,810
one of my might be pointing the other
way but anyway I kind of defined a set

1016
00:24:44,810 --> 00:24:44,820
way but anyway I kind of defined a set
 

1017
00:24:44,820 --> 00:24:47,959
way but anyway I kind of defined a set
of numbers that obeys this complicated

1018
00:24:47,959 --> 00:24:47,969
of numbers that obeys this complicated
 

1019
00:24:47,969 --> 00:24:50,209
of numbers that obeys this complicated
condition that each number counts how

1020
00:24:50,209 --> 00:24:50,219
condition that each number counts how
 

1021
00:24:50,219 --> 00:24:52,849
condition that each number counts how
many distinct numbers if it points do

1022
00:24:52,849 --> 00:24:52,859
many distinct numbers if it points do
 

1023
00:24:52,859 --> 00:24:57,289
many distinct numbers if it points do
well and still a guy sent me his

1024
00:24:57,289 --> 00:24:57,299
well and still a guy sent me his
 

1025
00:24:57,299 --> 00:25:00,259
well and still a guy sent me his
solution to this problem where he where

1026
00:25:00,259 --> 00:25:00,269
solution to this problem where he where
 

1027
00:25:00,269 --> 00:25:03,780
solution to this problem where he where
he presents

1028
00:25:03,780 --> 00:25:03,790
he presents
 

1029
00:25:03,790 --> 00:25:06,120
he presents
formal statements that that say either

1030
00:25:06,120 --> 00:25:06,130
formal statements that that say either
 

1031
00:25:06,130 --> 00:25:07,770
formal statements that that say either
this is true or this is true this is

1032
00:25:07,770 --> 00:25:07,780
this is true or this is true this is
 

1033
00:25:07,780 --> 00:25:10,770
this is true or this is true this is
true and and and so I try to render that

1034
00:25:10,770 --> 00:25:10,780
true and and and so I try to render that
 

1035
00:25:10,780 --> 00:25:14,130
true and and and so I try to render that
formal statement informally and I try

1036
00:25:14,130 --> 00:25:14,140
formal statement informally and I try
 

1037
00:25:14,140 --> 00:25:20,220
formal statement informally and I try
say I contain a three and and the guys

1038
00:25:20,220 --> 00:25:20,230
say I contain a three and and the guys
 

1039
00:25:20,230 --> 00:25:23,370
say I contain a three and and the guys
I'm pointing to contain the numbers one

1040
00:25:23,370 --> 00:25:23,380
I'm pointing to contain the numbers one
 

1041
00:25:23,380 --> 00:25:26,610
I'm pointing to contain the numbers one
two and six so by putting it in formally

1042
00:25:26,610 --> 00:25:26,620
two and six so by putting it in formally
 

1043
00:25:26,620 --> 00:25:29,220
two and six so by putting it in formally
and also I converted into a into a

1044
00:25:29,220 --> 00:25:29,230
and also I converted into a into a
 

1045
00:25:29,230 --> 00:25:32,760
and also I converted into a into a
dialogue statement that helps me

1046
00:25:32,760 --> 00:25:32,770
dialogue statement that helps me
 

1047
00:25:32,770 --> 00:25:35,700
dialogue statement that helps me
understand the logical statement that

1048
00:25:35,700 --> 00:25:35,710
understand the logical statement that
 

1049
00:25:35,710 --> 00:25:36,990
understand the logical statement that
he's written down as a string of numbers

1050
00:25:36,990 --> 00:25:37,000
he's written down as a string of numbers
 

1051
00:25:37,000 --> 00:25:40,320
he's written down as a string of numbers
in terms of some abstract variables

1052
00:25:40,320 --> 00:25:40,330
in terms of some abstract variables
 

1053
00:25:40,330 --> 00:25:40,980
in terms of some abstract variables
Eddie yeah

1054
00:25:40,980 --> 00:25:40,990
Eddie yeah
 

1055
00:25:40,990 --> 00:25:43,170
Eddie yeah
that's really interesting so maybe an

1056
00:25:43,170 --> 00:25:43,180
that's really interesting so maybe an
 

1057
00:25:43,180 --> 00:25:46,080
that's really interesting so maybe an
extension of that there has been a

1058
00:25:46,080 --> 00:25:46,090
extension of that there has been a
 

1059
00:25:46,090 --> 00:25:48,270
extension of that there has been a
resurgence in computer science and

1060
00:25:48,270 --> 00:25:48,280
resurgence in computer science and
 

1061
00:25:48,280 --> 00:25:52,820
resurgence in computer science and
machine learning and neural networks so

1062
00:25:52,820 --> 00:25:52,830
machine learning and neural networks so
 

1063
00:25:52,830 --> 00:25:56,670
machine learning and neural networks so
using data to construct algorithms so

1064
00:25:56,670 --> 00:25:56,680
using data to construct algorithms so
 

1065
00:25:56,680 --> 00:25:58,410
using data to construct algorithms so
it's another way to construct algorithms

1066
00:25:58,410 --> 00:25:58,420
it's another way to construct algorithms
 

1067
00:25:58,420 --> 00:26:03,050
it's another way to construct algorithms
really yes you can think of it that way

1068
00:26:03,050 --> 00:26:03,060
really yes you can think of it that way
 

1069
00:26:03,060 --> 00:26:05,340
really yes you can think of it that way
so as opposed to natural language to

1070
00:26:05,340 --> 00:26:05,350
so as opposed to natural language to
 

1071
00:26:05,350 --> 00:26:06,960
so as opposed to natural language to
construct algorithms use data to

1072
00:26:06,960 --> 00:26:06,970
construct algorithms use data to
 

1073
00:26:06,970 --> 00:26:10,920
construct algorithms use data to
construct other so what what's the view

1074
00:26:10,920 --> 00:26:10,930
construct other so what what's the view
 

1075
00:26:10,930 --> 00:26:13,770
construct other so what what's the view
of this branch of computer science where

1076
00:26:13,770 --> 00:26:13,780
of this branch of computer science where
 

1077
00:26:13,780 --> 00:26:16,430
of this branch of computer science where
data is almost more important than the

1078
00:26:16,430 --> 00:26:16,440
data is almost more important than the
 

1079
00:26:16,440 --> 00:26:19,320
data is almost more important than the
mechanism of the algorithm it seems to

1080
00:26:19,320 --> 00:26:19,330
mechanism of the algorithm it seems to
 

1081
00:26:19,330 --> 00:26:23,270
mechanism of the algorithm it seems to
be suited to a certain kind of non geek

1082
00:26:23,270 --> 00:26:23,280
be suited to a certain kind of non geek
 

1083
00:26:23,280 --> 00:26:25,890
be suited to a certain kind of non geek
and would you know which is probably why

1084
00:26:25,890 --> 00:26:25,900
and would you know which is probably why
 

1085
00:26:25,900 --> 00:26:29,790
and would you know which is probably why
it's it's like it's taken off that it

1086
00:26:29,790 --> 00:26:29,800
it's it's like it's taken off that it
 

1087
00:26:29,800 --> 00:26:31,830
it's it's like it's taken off that it
has its own community that I thought

1088
00:26:31,830 --> 00:26:31,840
has its own community that I thought
 

1089
00:26:31,840 --> 00:26:33,800
has its own community that I thought
really that really resonates with that

1090
00:26:33,800 --> 00:26:33,810
really that really resonates with that
 

1091
00:26:33,810 --> 00:26:37,680
really that really resonates with that
but it's hard to you know to trust

1092
00:26:37,680 --> 00:26:37,690
but it's hard to you know to trust
 

1093
00:26:37,690 --> 00:26:40,010
but it's hard to you know to trust
something like that because nobody even

1094
00:26:40,010 --> 00:26:40,020
something like that because nobody even
 

1095
00:26:40,020 --> 00:26:43,080
something like that because nobody even
the people who who work with it that

1096
00:26:43,080 --> 00:26:43,090
the people who who work with it that
 

1097
00:26:43,090 --> 00:26:45,810
the people who who work with it that
they have no idea what is what has been

1098
00:26:45,810 --> 00:26:45,820
they have no idea what is what has been
 

1099
00:26:45,820 --> 00:26:48,060
they have no idea what is what has been
learned that's a really interesting

1100
00:26:48,060 --> 00:26:48,070
learned that's a really interesting
 

1101
00:26:48,070 --> 00:26:53,250
learned that's a really interesting
thought that it's it makes algorithms

1102
00:26:53,250 --> 00:26:53,260
thought that it's it makes algorithms
 

1103
00:26:53,260 --> 00:26:56,250
thought that it's it makes algorithms
more accessible to a different community

1104
00:26:56,250 --> 00:26:56,260
more accessible to a different community
 

1105
00:26:56,260 --> 00:26:59,850
more accessible to a different community
a different type of brain yep and that's

1106
00:26:59,850 --> 00:26:59,860
a different type of brain yep and that's
 

1107
00:26:59,860 --> 00:27:03,060
a different type of brain yep and that's
really interesting because just like

1108
00:27:03,060 --> 00:27:03,070
really interesting because just like
 

1109
00:27:03,070 --> 00:27:06,830
really interesting because just like
literate programming perhaps could make

1110
00:27:06,830 --> 00:27:06,840
literate programming perhaps could make
 

1111
00:27:06,840 --> 00:27:09,420
literate programming perhaps could make
programming more accessible to a certain

1112
00:27:09,420 --> 00:27:09,430
programming more accessible to a certain
 

1113
00:27:09,430 --> 00:27:11,370
programming more accessible to a certain
kind of brain there are people who think

1114
00:27:11,370 --> 00:27:11,380
kind of brain there are people who think
 

1115
00:27:11,380 --> 00:27:13,800
kind of brain there are people who think
it's just a matter of Education and

1116
00:27:13,800 --> 00:27:13,810
it's just a matter of Education and
 

1117
00:27:13,810 --> 00:27:16,020
it's just a matter of Education and
anybody can learn to be a great program

1118
00:27:16,020 --> 00:27:16,030
anybody can learn to be a great program
 

1119
00:27:16,030 --> 00:27:17,460
anybody can learn to be a great program
or anybody can

1120
00:27:17,460 --> 00:27:17,470
or anybody can
 

1121
00:27:17,470 --> 00:27:23,580
or anybody can
to be a great skier uh yeah you know I I

1122
00:27:23,580 --> 00:27:23,590
to be a great skier uh yeah you know I I
 

1123
00:27:23,590 --> 00:27:25,769
to be a great skier uh yeah you know I I
wish that were true but but I know that

1124
00:27:25,769 --> 00:27:25,779
wish that were true but but I know that
 

1125
00:27:25,779 --> 00:27:27,690
wish that were true but but I know that
there's a lot of things that I've tried

1126
00:27:27,690 --> 00:27:27,700
there's a lot of things that I've tried
 

1127
00:27:27,700 --> 00:27:30,720
there's a lot of things that I've tried
to do and I and like I was well motivate

1128
00:27:30,720 --> 00:27:30,730
to do and I and like I was well motivate
 

1129
00:27:30,730 --> 00:27:33,269
to do and I and like I was well motivate
an icon and I kept trying to build

1130
00:27:33,269 --> 00:27:33,279
an icon and I kept trying to build
 

1131
00:27:33,279 --> 00:27:35,279
an icon and I kept trying to build
myself up and I never got past a certain

1132
00:27:35,279 --> 00:27:35,289
myself up and I never got past a certain
 

1133
00:27:35,289 --> 00:27:38,490
myself up and I never got past a certain
level I can't use for example I can't

1134
00:27:38,490 --> 00:27:38,500
level I can't use for example I can't
 

1135
00:27:38,500 --> 00:27:43,619
level I can't use for example I can't
view three-dimensional objects in my in

1136
00:27:43,619 --> 00:27:43,629
view three-dimensional objects in my in
 

1137
00:27:43,629 --> 00:27:45,899
view three-dimensional objects in my in
my head I have to I have to make a model

1138
00:27:45,899 --> 00:27:45,909
my head I have to I have to make a model
 

1139
00:27:45,909 --> 00:27:47,730
my head I have to I have to make a model
and look at it and study it from all

1140
00:27:47,730 --> 00:27:47,740
and look at it and study it from all
 

1141
00:27:47,740 --> 00:27:49,649
and look at it and study it from all
points of view and then I start to get

1142
00:27:49,649 --> 00:27:49,659
points of view and then I start to get
 

1143
00:27:49,659 --> 00:27:52,049
points of view and then I start to get
some idea but other people are good at

1144
00:27:52,049 --> 00:27:52,059
some idea but other people are good at
 

1145
00:27:52,059 --> 00:27:57,139
some idea but other people are good at
four dimensions I mean physicists yeah

1146
00:27:57,139 --> 00:27:57,149
four dimensions I mean physicists yeah
 

1147
00:27:57,149 --> 00:28:03,539
four dimensions I mean physicists yeah
so let's go to the art of computer

1148
00:28:03,539 --> 00:28:03,549
so let's go to the art of computer
 

1149
00:28:03,549 --> 00:28:07,440
so let's go to the art of computer
programming in 1962 you set the table of

1150
00:28:07,440 --> 00:28:07,450
programming in 1962 you set the table of
 

1151
00:28:07,450 --> 00:28:13,080
programming in 1962 you set the table of
contents for this magnum opus right yeah

1152
00:28:13,080 --> 00:28:13,090
contents for this magnum opus right yeah
 

1153
00:28:13,090 --> 00:28:15,389
contents for this magnum opus right yeah
it was supposed to be a single book for

1154
00:28:15,389 --> 00:28:15,399
it was supposed to be a single book for
 

1155
00:28:15,399 --> 00:28:19,490
it was supposed to be a single book for
12 chapters now today what is it

1156
00:28:19,490 --> 00:28:19,500
12 chapters now today what is it
 

1157
00:28:19,500 --> 00:28:23,100
12 chapters now today what is it
57 years later you're in the middle of

1158
00:28:23,100 --> 00:28:23,110
57 years later you're in the middle of
 

1159
00:28:23,110 --> 00:28:27,570
57 years later you're in the middle of
volume 4 of 7 and in the middle of going

1160
00:28:27,570 --> 00:28:27,580
volume 4 of 7 and in the middle of going
 

1161
00:28:27,580 --> 00:28:31,139
volume 4 of 7 and in the middle of going
for B is 4 B precisely can ask you for

1162
00:28:31,139 --> 00:28:31,149
for B is 4 B precisely can ask you for
 

1163
00:28:31,149 --> 00:28:34,940
for B is 4 B precisely can ask you for
an impossible task which is try to

1164
00:28:34,940 --> 00:28:34,950
an impossible task which is try to
 

1165
00:28:34,950 --> 00:28:39,240
an impossible task which is try to
summarize the book so far maybe by

1166
00:28:39,240 --> 00:28:39,250
summarize the book so far maybe by
 

1167
00:28:39,250 --> 00:28:42,210
summarize the book so far maybe by
giving a little examples so from the

1168
00:28:42,210 --> 00:28:42,220
giving a little examples so from the
 

1169
00:28:42,220 --> 00:28:43,799
giving a little examples so from the
sorting and the search in the

1170
00:28:43,799 --> 00:28:43,809
sorting and the search in the
 

1171
00:28:43,809 --> 00:28:46,830
sorting and the search in the
combinatorial algorithms if you were to

1172
00:28:46,830 --> 00:28:46,840
combinatorial algorithms if you were to
 

1173
00:28:46,840 --> 00:28:51,049
combinatorial algorithms if you were to
give a summary a quick elevator summary

1174
00:28:51,049 --> 00:28:51,059
give a summary a quick elevator summary
 

1175
00:28:51,059 --> 00:28:53,340
give a summary a quick elevator summary
yeah right what depending how many

1176
00:28:53,340 --> 00:28:53,350
yeah right what depending how many
 

1177
00:28:53,350 --> 00:28:55,310
yeah right what depending how many
floors that are in the building yes

1178
00:28:55,310 --> 00:28:55,320
floors that are in the building yes
 

1179
00:28:55,320 --> 00:28:57,840
floors that are in the building yes
the first volume called fundamental

1180
00:28:57,840 --> 00:28:57,850
the first volume called fundamental
 

1181
00:28:57,850 --> 00:29:01,409
the first volume called fundamental
algorithms talks about something that

1182
00:29:01,409 --> 00:29:01,419
algorithms talks about something that
 

1183
00:29:01,419 --> 00:29:03,480
algorithms talks about something that
you can't the stuff you can't do without

1184
00:29:03,480 --> 00:29:03,490
you can't the stuff you can't do without
 

1185
00:29:03,490 --> 00:29:07,080
you can't the stuff you can't do without
I guess that you have to know the basic

1186
00:29:07,080 --> 00:29:07,090
I guess that you have to know the basic
 

1187
00:29:07,090 --> 00:29:10,259
I guess that you have to know the basic
concepts of what is a program now what

1188
00:29:10,259 --> 00:29:10,269
concepts of what is a program now what
 

1189
00:29:10,269 --> 00:29:13,019
concepts of what is a program now what
is it what is it algorithm and and and

1190
00:29:13,019 --> 00:29:13,029
is it what is it algorithm and and and
 

1191
00:29:13,029 --> 00:29:15,840
is it what is it algorithm and and and
it also talks about a low-level machine

1192
00:29:15,840 --> 00:29:15,850
it also talks about a low-level machine
 

1193
00:29:15,850 --> 00:29:17,249
it also talks about a low-level machine
so you can have some some kind of an

1194
00:29:17,249 --> 00:29:17,259
so you can have some some kind of an
 

1195
00:29:17,259 --> 00:29:22,529
so you can have some some kind of an
idea what's going on and it has basic

1196
00:29:22,529 --> 00:29:22,539
idea what's going on and it has basic
 

1197
00:29:22,539 --> 00:29:26,149
idea what's going on and it has basic
concepts of input/output and subroutines

1198
00:29:26,149 --> 00:29:26,159
concepts of input/output and subroutines
 

1199
00:29:26,159 --> 00:29:30,960
concepts of input/output and subroutines
induction induction writes mathematical

1200
00:29:30,960 --> 00:29:30,970
induction induction writes mathematical
 

1201
00:29:30,970 --> 00:29:33,750
induction induction writes mathematical
so so the thing that makes my book

1202
00:29:33,750 --> 00:29:33,760
so so the thing that makes my book
 

1203
00:29:33,760 --> 00:29:37,440
so so the thing that makes my book
different from a lot of others is that

1204
00:29:37,440 --> 00:29:37,450
different from a lot of others is that
 

1205
00:29:37,450 --> 00:29:40,409
different from a lot of others is that
all that I try to not only present the

1206
00:29:40,409 --> 00:29:40,419
all that I try to not only present the
 

1207
00:29:40,419 --> 00:29:42,120
all that I try to not only present the
algún but I try to analyze them and

1208
00:29:42,120 --> 00:29:42,130
algún but I try to analyze them and
 

1209
00:29:42,130 --> 00:29:44,669
algún but I try to analyze them and
which means to quantitatively I say not

1210
00:29:44,669 --> 00:29:44,679
which means to quantitatively I say not
 

1211
00:29:44,679 --> 00:29:46,940
which means to quantitatively I say not
only does it work but it works this fast

1212
00:29:46,940 --> 00:29:46,950
only does it work but it works this fast
 

1213
00:29:46,950 --> 00:29:49,649
only does it work but it works this fast
okay and so I need math for them and

1214
00:29:49,649 --> 00:29:49,659
okay and so I need math for them and
 

1215
00:29:49,659 --> 00:29:51,360
okay and so I need math for them and
then there's the standard way to

1216
00:29:51,360 --> 00:29:51,370
then there's the standard way to
 

1217
00:29:51,370 --> 00:29:53,220
then there's the standard way to
structure data inside and represent

1218
00:29:53,220 --> 00:29:53,230
structure data inside and represent
 

1219
00:29:53,230 --> 00:29:56,549
structure data inside and represent
information in the computer so that's

1220
00:29:56,549 --> 00:29:56,559
information in the computer so that's
 

1221
00:29:56,559 --> 00:29:59,399
information in the computer so that's
all volume 1 volume 2 talks

1222
00:29:59,399 --> 00:29:59,409
all volume 1 volume 2 talks
 

1223
00:29:59,409 --> 00:30:01,500
all volume 1 volume 2 talks
it's called semi numerical algorithms

1224
00:30:01,500 --> 00:30:01,510
it's called semi numerical algorithms
 

1225
00:30:01,510 --> 00:30:03,659
it's called semi numerical algorithms
and here we're here we're writing

1226
00:30:03,659 --> 00:30:03,669
and here we're here we're writing
 

1227
00:30:03,669 --> 00:30:06,270
and here we're here we're writing
programs but we're also dealing with

1228
00:30:06,270 --> 00:30:06,280
programs but we're also dealing with
 

1229
00:30:06,280 --> 00:30:09,330
programs but we're also dealing with
numbers algorithms deal with with with

1230
00:30:09,330 --> 00:30:09,340
numbers algorithms deal with with with
 

1231
00:30:09,340 --> 00:30:11,730
numbers algorithms deal with with with
any kinds of objects but but specific

1232
00:30:11,730 --> 00:30:11,740
any kinds of objects but but specific
 

1233
00:30:11,740 --> 00:30:13,649
any kinds of objects but but specific
when there's objects or numbers well

1234
00:30:13,649 --> 00:30:13,659
when there's objects or numbers well
 

1235
00:30:13,659 --> 00:30:17,250
when there's objects or numbers well
then then we have certain special

1236
00:30:17,250 --> 00:30:17,260
then then we have certain special
 

1237
00:30:17,260 --> 00:30:19,590
then then we have certain special
paradigms that apply to things that have

1238
00:30:19,590 --> 00:30:19,600
paradigms that apply to things that have
 

1239
00:30:19,600 --> 00:30:21,960
paradigms that apply to things that have
12 numbers and so there's there's what

1240
00:30:21,960 --> 00:30:21,970
12 numbers and so there's there's what
 

1241
00:30:21,970 --> 00:30:24,000
12 numbers and so there's there's what
there's like there's arithmetic on

1242
00:30:24,000 --> 00:30:24,010
there's like there's arithmetic on
 

1243
00:30:24,010 --> 00:30:26,880
there's like there's arithmetic on
numbers and and there's matrices full of

1244
00:30:26,880 --> 00:30:26,890
numbers and and there's matrices full of
 

1245
00:30:26,890 --> 00:30:29,130
numbers and and there's matrices full of
numbers there's random numbers and

1246
00:30:29,130 --> 00:30:29,140
numbers there's random numbers and
 

1247
00:30:29,140 --> 00:30:31,440
numbers there's random numbers and
there's power series full of numbers

1248
00:30:31,440 --> 00:30:31,450
there's power series full of numbers
 

1249
00:30:31,450 --> 00:30:34,289
there's power series full of numbers
there's different algebraic concepts

1250
00:30:34,289 --> 00:30:34,299
there's different algebraic concepts
 

1251
00:30:34,299 --> 00:30:36,990
there's different algebraic concepts
that have numbers in structured ways and

1252

so again algorithms that that underlie

1284
00:31:13,279 --> 00:31:13,289
so again algorithms that that underlie

so then volume 4 goes into combinatorial

1298
00:31:29,749 --> 00:31:29,759
so then volume 4 goes into combinatorial
 

1299
00:31:29,759 --> 00:31:32,320
so then volume 4 goes into combinatorial
I'll again this is where we have

I'll again this is where we have
zillions of things to deal with and we

than a million times faster and and and

1308
00:31:48,200 --> 00:31:48,210
than a million times faster and and and
 

1309
00:31:48,210 --> 00:31:50,830
than a million times faster and and and
we're dealing with problems that are

1310
00:31:50,830 --> 00:31:50,840
we're dealing with problems that are
 

1311
00:31:50,840 --> 00:31:52,879
we're dealing with problems that are
probably never going to be solved

1312
00:31:52,879 --> 00:31:52,889
probably never going to be solved
 

1313
00:31:52,889 --> 00:31:55,279
probably never going to be solved
efficiently but that doesn't mean we

1314
00:31:55,279 --> 00:31:55,289
efficiently but that doesn't mean we
 

1315
00:31:55,289 --> 00:31:58,580
efficiently but that doesn't mean we
give up on them and and and we have this

1316
00:31:58,580 --> 00:31:58,590
give up on them and and and we have this
 

1317
00:31:58,590 --> 00:32:00,830
give up on them and and and we have this
chance to have good ideas and and go

1318
00:32:00,830 --> 00:32:00,840
chance to have good ideas and and go
 

1319
00:32:00,840 --> 00:32:03,379
chance to have good ideas and and go
much much faster on them so so that's

1320
00:32:03,379 --> 00:32:03,389
much much faster on them so so that's
 

1321
00:32:03,389 --> 00:32:05,180
much much faster on them so so that's

00:34:09,490 --> 00:34:09,500
be a book about how to write compilers
 

1409
00:34:09,500 --> 00:34:13,740
be a book about how to write compilers
and I was asked to write a book

1410
00:34:13,740 --> 00:34:13,750
and I was asked to write a book
 

1411
00:34:13,750 --> 00:34:15,639
and I was asked to write a book
explaining how to how to write a

1412
00:34:15,639 --> 00:34:15,649
explaining how to how to write a
 

1413
00:34:15,649 --> 00:34:20,369
explaining how to how to write a
compiler and at that time there were

1414
00:34:20,369 --> 00:34:20,379
compiler and at that time there were
 

1415
00:34:20,379 --> 00:34:22,960
compiler and at that time there were
only a few dozen people in the world who

1416
00:34:22,960 --> 00:34:22,970
only a few dozen people in the world who
 

1417
00:34:22,970 --> 00:34:24,789
only a few dozen people in the world who
had written compilers and I happen to be

1418
00:34:24,789 --> 00:34:24,799
had written compilers and I happen to be
 

1419
00:34:24,799 --> 00:34:29,349
had written compilers and I happen to be
one of them so and I also had some

1420
00:34:29,349 --> 00:34:29,359
one of them so and I also had some
 

1421
00:34:29,359 --> 00:34:33,099
one of them so and I also had some
experience for writing for like the

1422
00:34:33,099 --> 00:34:33,109
experience for writing for like the
 

1423
00:34:33,109 --> 00:34:35,789
experience for writing for like the
campus newspaper and things like that so

1424
00:34:35,789 --> 00:34:35,799
campus newspaper and things like that so
 

1425
00:34:35,799 --> 00:34:39,280
campus newspaper and things like that so
so I said okay great I'm the only person

1426
00:34:39,280 --> 00:34:39,290
so I said okay great I'm the only person
 

1427
00:34:39,290 --> 00:34:42,220
so I said okay great I'm the only person
I know who who's written a compiler but

1428
00:34:42,220 --> 00:34:42,230
I know who who's written a compiler but
 

1429
00:34:42,230 --> 00:34:43,899
I know who who's written a compiler but
hasn't invented any new techniques for

1430
00:34:43,899 --> 00:34:43,909
hasn't invented any new techniques for
 

1431
00:34:43,909 --> 00:34:45,909
hasn't invented any new techniques for
writing compilers and and all the other

1432
00:34:45,909 --> 00:34:45,919
writing compilers and and all the other
 

1433
00:34:45,919 --> 00:34:50,049
writing compilers and and all the other
people I knew had super ideas but I

1434
00:34:50,049 --> 00:34:50,059
people I knew had super ideas but I
 

1435
00:34:50,059 --> 00:34:51,609
people I knew had super ideas but I
couldn't see that they would be able to

1436
00:34:51,609 --> 00:34:51,619
couldn't see that they would be able to
 

1437
00:34:51,619 --> 00:34:53,260
couldn't see that they would be able to
write a book that wouldn't that would

1438
00:34:53,260 --> 00:34:53,270
write a book that wouldn't that would
 

1439
00:34:53,270 --> 00:34:55,089
write a book that wouldn't that would
describe anybody else's ideas with their

1440
00:34:55,089 --> 00:34:55,099
describe anybody else's ideas with their
 

1441
00:34:55,099 --> 00:34:57,970
describe anybody else's ideas with their
own so I could be the I could be the

1442
00:34:57,970 --> 00:34:57,980
own so I could be the I could be the
 

1443
00:34:57,980 --> 00:34:59,950
own so I could be the I could be the
journalist and I could explained what

1444
00:34:59,950 --> 00:34:59,960
journalist and I could explained what
 

1445
00:34:59,960 --> 00:35:02,559
journalist and I could explained what
all these cool ideas about compiler

1446
00:35:02,559 --> 00:35:02,569
all these cool ideas about compiler
 

1447
00:35:02,569 --> 00:35:06,010
all these cool ideas about compiler
writing that were and and then I I

1448
00:35:06,010 --> 00:35:06,020
writing that were and and then I I
 

1449
00:35:06,020 --> 00:35:07,090
writing that were and and then I I
started pretty

1450
00:35:07,090 --> 00:35:07,100
started pretty
 

1451
00:35:07,100 --> 00:35:09,700
started pretty
well yeah let me you need and have a

1452
00:35:09,700 --> 00:35:09,710
well yeah let me you need and have a
 

1453
00:35:09,710 --> 00:35:11,260
well yeah let me you need and have a
chapter about data structures you need

1454
00:35:11,260 --> 00:35:11,270
chapter about data structures you need
 

1455
00:35:11,270 --> 00:35:13,810
chapter about data structures you need
to have some introductory material I

1456
00:35:13,810 --> 00:35:13,820
to have some introductory material I
 

1457
00:35:13,820 --> 00:35:15,340
to have some introductory material I
want to talk about searching because a

1458
00:35:15,340 --> 00:35:15,350
want to talk about searching because a
 

1459
00:35:15,350 --> 00:35:19,420
want to talk about searching because a
compiler writer has to it has to look up

1460
00:35:19,420 --> 00:35:19,430
compiler writer has to it has to look up
 

1461
00:35:19,430 --> 00:35:22,630
compiler writer has to it has to look up
the variables in a symbol table and find

1462
00:35:22,630 --> 00:35:22,640
the variables in a symbol table and find
 

1463
00:35:22,640 --> 00:35:27,490
the variables in a symbol table and find
out you know which which when you when

1464
00:35:27,490 --> 00:35:27,500
out you know which which when you when
 

1465
00:35:27,500 --> 00:35:29,410
out you know which which when you when
you write the name of a variable in one

1466
00:35:29,410 --> 00:35:29,420
you write the name of a variable in one
 

1467
00:35:29,420 --> 00:35:31,570
you write the name of a variable in one
place it's supposed to be the same as

1468
00:35:31,570 --> 00:35:31,580
place it's supposed to be the same as
 

1469
00:35:31,580 --> 00:35:33,280
place it's supposed to be the same as
the one you put somewhere else so you

1470
00:35:33,280 --> 00:35:33,290
the one you put somewhere else so you
 

1471
00:35:33,290 --> 00:35:35,980
the one you put somewhere else so you
need all these basic techniques and I

1472
00:35:35,980 --> 00:35:35,990
need all these basic techniques and I
 

1473
00:35:35,990 --> 00:35:38,920
need all these basic techniques and I
and I you know kind of know some

1474
00:35:38,920 --> 00:35:38,930
and I you know kind of know some
 

1475
00:35:38,930 --> 00:35:40,840
and I you know kind of know some
arithmetic to stuff so I throw I threw

1476
00:35:40,840 --> 00:35:40,850
arithmetic to stuff so I throw I threw
 

1477
00:35:40,850 --> 00:35:42,730
arithmetic to stuff so I throw I threw
in these chapters and I threw in a

1478
00:35:42,730 --> 00:35:42,740
in these chapters and I threw in a
 

1479
00:35:42,740 --> 00:35:46,120
in these chapters and I threw in a
chapter on comma talks because that was

1480
00:35:46,120 --> 00:35:46,130
chapter on comma talks because that was
 

1481
00:35:46,130 --> 00:35:48,010
chapter on comma talks because that was
what I really enjoyed programming the

1482
00:35:48,010 --> 00:35:48,020
what I really enjoyed programming the
 

1483
00:35:48,020 --> 00:35:49,570
what I really enjoyed programming the
most but there weren't many algorithms

1484
00:35:49,570 --> 00:35:49,580
most but there weren't many algorithms
 

1485
00:35:49,580 --> 00:35:51,700
most but there weren't many algorithms
and known about combinatorial methods in

1486
00:35:51,700 --> 00:35:51,710
and known about combinatorial methods in
 

1487
00:35:51,710 --> 00:35:54,910
and known about combinatorial methods in
1962 so that was a kind of a short

1488
00:35:54,910 --> 00:35:54,920
1962 so that was a kind of a short
 

1489
00:35:54,920 --> 00:35:56,830
1962 so that was a kind of a short
chapter but it was sort of thrown in

1490
00:35:56,830 --> 00:35:56,840
chapter but it was sort of thrown in
 

1491
00:35:56,840 --> 00:35:59,350
chapter but it was sort of thrown in
just for fun and Chapter twelve was

1492
00:35:59,350 --> 00:35:59,360
just for fun and Chapter twelve was
 

1493
00:35:59,360 --> 00:36:01,690
just for fun and Chapter twelve was
going to be actual compilers applying

1494
00:36:01,690 --> 00:36:01,700
going to be actual compilers applying
 

1495
00:36:01,700 --> 00:36:05,680
going to be actual compilers applying
all the stuff in chapters 1 to 11 to

1496
00:36:05,680 --> 00:36:05,690
all the stuff in chapters 1 to 11 to
 

1497
00:36:05,690 --> 00:36:07,780
all the stuff in chapters 1 to 11 to
make compilers well ok so that was my

1498
00:36:07,780 --> 00:36:07,790
make compilers well ok so that was my
 

1499
00:36:07,790 --> 00:36:11,530
make compilers well ok so that was my
table of contents from 1962 and during

1500
00:36:11,530 --> 00:36:11,540
table of contents from 1962 and during
 

1501
00:36:11,540 --> 00:36:14,350
table of contents from 1962 and during
the 70s the whole field of combinatoric

1502
00:36:14,350 --> 00:36:14,360
the 70s the whole field of combinatoric
 

1503
00:36:14,360 --> 00:36:18,010
the 70s the whole field of combinatoric
s-- went through a huge explosion people

1504
00:36:18,010 --> 00:36:18,020
s-- went through a huge explosion people
 

1505
00:36:18,020 --> 00:36:20,110
s-- went through a huge explosion people
talk about it comet oil explosion and

1506
00:36:20,110 --> 00:36:20,120
talk about it comet oil explosion and
 

1507
00:36:20,120 --> 00:36:22,780
talk about it comet oil explosion and
they usually mean by that that the

1508
00:36:22,780 --> 00:36:22,790
they usually mean by that that the
 

1509
00:36:22,790 --> 00:36:25,060
they usually mean by that that the
number of cases goes up you know you

1510
00:36:25,060 --> 00:36:25,070
number of cases goes up you know you
 

1511
00:36:25,070 --> 00:36:27,460
number of cases goes up you know you
change n to n plus 1 and all of a sudden

1512
00:36:27,460 --> 00:36:27,470
change n to n plus 1 and all of a sudden
 

1513
00:36:27,470 --> 00:36:29,710
change n to n plus 1 and all of a sudden
you your problem has gotten more than

1514
00:36:29,710 --> 00:36:29,720
you your problem has gotten more than
 

1515
00:36:29,720 --> 00:36:33,160
you your problem has gotten more than
ten times harder but there was an

1516
00:36:33,160 --> 00:36:33,170
ten times harder but there was an
 

1517
00:36:33,170 --> 00:36:36,190
ten times harder but there was an
explosion of ideas about combinatoric

1518
00:36:36,190 --> 00:36:36,200
explosion of ideas about combinatoric
 

1519
00:36:36,200 --> 00:36:39,430
explosion of ideas about combinatoric
s-- in the 70s and to the point that but

1520
00:36:39,430 --> 00:36:39,440
s-- in the 70s and to the point that but
 

1521
00:36:39,440 --> 00:36:44,230
s-- in the 70s and to the point that but
Mike's take 1975 I bet you more than

1522
00:36:44,230 --> 00:36:44,240
Mike's take 1975 I bet you more than
 

1523
00:36:44,240 --> 00:36:45,880
Mike's take 1975 I bet you more than
half of all the journals of computer

1524
00:36:45,880 --> 00:36:45,890
half of all the journals of computer
 

1525
00:36:45,890 --> 00:36:48,700
half of all the journals of computer
science we're about combinatorial method

1526
00:36:48,700 --> 00:36:48,710
science we're about combinatorial method
 

1527
00:36:48,710 --> 00:36:50,800
science we're about combinatorial method
and what kind of problems were occupying

1528
00:36:50,800 --> 00:36:50,810
and what kind of problems were occupying
 

1529
00:36:50,810 --> 00:36:53,500
and what kind of problems were occupying
people's minds what kind of problems in

1530
00:36:53,500 --> 00:36:53,510
people's minds what kind of problems in
 

1531
00:36:53,510 --> 00:36:56,680
people's minds what kind of problems in
combinatorics was it's it's that gravity

1532
00:36:56,680 --> 00:36:56,690
combinatorics was it's it's that gravity
 

1533
00:36:56,690 --> 00:36:59,350
combinatorics was it's it's that gravity
graph theory yeah gravity was was quite

1534
00:36:59,350 --> 00:36:59,360
graph theory yeah gravity was was quite
 

1535
00:36:59,360 --> 00:37:03,910
graph theory yeah gravity was was quite
dominant I mean no but all of the

1536
00:37:03,910 --> 00:37:03,920
dominant I mean no but all of the
 

1537
00:37:03,920 --> 00:37:07,080
dominant I mean no but all of the
np-hard problems that you have like

1538
00:37:07,080 --> 00:37:07,090
np-hard problems that you have like
 

1539
00:37:07,090 --> 00:37:10,000
np-hard problems that you have like
Hamiltonian path or foul sail going

1540
00:37:10,000 --> 00:37:10,010
Hamiltonian path or foul sail going
 

1541
00:37:10,010 --> 00:37:12,220
Hamiltonian path or foul sail going
beyond yeah yeah going beyond graphs you

1542
00:37:12,220 --> 00:37:12,230
beyond yeah yeah going beyond graphs you
 

1543
00:37:12,230 --> 00:37:16,630
beyond yeah yeah going beyond graphs you
had a operation research whenever it was

1544
00:37:16,630 --> 00:37:16,640
had a operation research whenever it was
 

1545
00:37:16,640 --> 00:37:18,250
had a operation research whenever it was
a small class of problems that had

1546
00:37:18,250 --> 00:37:18,260
a small class of problems that had
 

1547
00:37:18,260 --> 00:37:19,970
a small class of problems that had
efficient solutions and they were

1548
00:37:19,970 --> 00:37:19,980
efficient solutions and they were
 

1549
00:37:19,980 --> 00:37:22,310
efficient solutions and they were
associated with Maitre D' a special

1550
00:37:22,310 --> 00:37:22,320
associated with Maitre D' a special
 

1551
00:37:22,320 --> 00:37:25,190
associated with Maitre D' a special
mathematical construction but once we

1552
00:37:25,190 --> 00:37:25,200
mathematical construction but once we
 

1553
00:37:25,200 --> 00:37:28,070
mathematical construction but once we
went to things that involve three things

1554
00:37:28,070 --> 00:37:28,080
went to things that involve three things
 

1555
00:37:28,080 --> 00:37:30,560
went to things that involve three things
at a time instead of instead of two all

1556
00:37:30,560 --> 00:37:30,570
at a time instead of instead of two all
 

1557
00:37:30,570 --> 00:37:32,660
at a time instead of instead of two all
of a sudden the things got harder so we

1558
00:37:32,660 --> 00:37:32,670
of a sudden the things got harder so we
 

1559
00:37:32,670 --> 00:37:35,450
of a sudden the things got harder so we
had satisfiability problems or if you

1560
00:37:35,450 --> 00:37:35,460
had satisfiability problems or if you
 

1561
00:37:35,460 --> 00:37:38,450
had satisfiability problems or if you
have if you have clauses every Clause

1562
00:37:38,450 --> 00:37:38,460
have if you have clauses every Clause
 

1563
00:37:38,460 --> 00:37:40,760
have if you have clauses every Clause
has two logical elements in it then we

1564
00:37:40,760 --> 00:37:40,770
has two logical elements in it then we
 

1565
00:37:40,770 --> 00:37:43,580
has two logical elements in it then we
can satisfy it linear time we can test

1566
00:37:43,580 --> 00:37:43,590
can satisfy it linear time we can test
 

1567
00:37:43,590 --> 00:37:45,440
can satisfy it linear time we can test
for satisfy building linear time but if

1568
00:37:45,440 --> 00:37:45,450
for satisfy building linear time but if
 

1569
00:37:45,450 --> 00:37:48,200
for satisfy building linear time but if
you allow yourself three variables in

1570
00:37:48,200 --> 00:37:48,210
you allow yourself three variables in
 

1571
00:37:48,210 --> 00:37:52,099
you allow yourself three variables in
the clause then nobody knows how to do

1572
00:37:52,099 --> 00:37:52,109
the clause then nobody knows how to do
 

1573
00:37:52,109 --> 00:37:54,980
the clause then nobody knows how to do
it so these articles were about trying

1574
00:37:54,980 --> 00:37:54,990
it so these articles were about trying
 

1575
00:37:54,990 --> 00:37:58,010
it so these articles were about trying
to find better or better ways to to

1576
00:37:58,010 --> 00:37:58,020
to find better or better ways to to
 

1577
00:37:58,020 --> 00:38:00,800
to find better or better ways to to
solve cryptography problems and graph

1578
00:38:00,800 --> 00:38:00,810
solve cryptography problems and graph
 

1579
00:38:00,810 --> 00:38:03,980
solve cryptography problems and graph
three problems where the we have lots of

1580
00:38:03,980 --> 00:38:03,990
three problems where the we have lots of
 

1581
00:38:03,990 --> 00:38:05,900
three problems where the we have lots of
data but we didn't know how to find the

1582
00:38:05,900 --> 00:38:05,910
data but we didn't know how to find the
 

1583
00:38:05,910 --> 00:38:08,000
data but we didn't know how to find the
best subset so the data like with

1584
00:38:08,000 --> 00:38:08,010
best subset so the data like with
 

1585
00:38:08,010 --> 00:38:12,260
best subset so the data like with
sorting we could get the answer didn't

1586
00:38:12,260 --> 00:38:12,270
sorting we could get the answer didn't
 

1587
00:38:12,270 --> 00:38:14,300
sorting we could get the answer didn't
take long so how did they continue to

1588
00:38:14,300 --> 00:38:14,310
take long so how did they continue to
 

1589
00:38:14,310 --> 00:38:17,810
take long so how did they continue to
change from the 70s to today yeah so now

1590
00:38:17,810 --> 00:38:17,820
change from the 70s to today yeah so now
 

1591
00:38:17,820 --> 00:38:20,570
change from the 70s to today yeah so now
there may be half a dozen conferences

1592
00:38:20,570 --> 00:38:20,580
there may be half a dozen conferences
 

1593
00:38:20,580 --> 00:38:24,530
there may be half a dozen conferences
whose topic is cognate arcs different

1594
00:38:24,530 --> 00:38:24,540
whose topic is cognate arcs different
 

1595
00:38:24,540 --> 00:38:26,480
whose topic is cognate arcs different
kind but fortunately I don't have to

1596
00:38:26,480 --> 00:38:26,490
kind but fortunately I don't have to
 

1597
00:38:26,490 --> 00:38:28,460
kind but fortunately I don't have to
rewrite my book every month you know

1598
00:38:28,460 --> 00:38:28,470
rewrite my book every month you know
 

1599
00:38:28,470 --> 00:38:31,550
rewrite my book every month you know
like I had to in in the 70 but still

1600
00:38:31,550 --> 00:38:31,560
like I had to in in the 70 but still
 

1601
00:38:31,560 --> 00:38:33,470
like I had to in in the 70 but still
there's huge amount of work being done

1602
00:38:33,470 --> 00:38:33,480
there's huge amount of work being done
 

1603
00:38:33,480 --> 00:38:37,099
there's huge amount of work being done
and people getting better ideas on these

1604
00:38:37,099 --> 00:38:37,109
and people getting better ideas on these
 

1605
00:38:37,109 --> 00:38:40,340
and people getting better ideas on these
problems that don't seem to have really

1606
00:38:40,340 --> 00:38:40,350
problems that don't seem to have really
 

1607
00:38:40,350 --> 00:38:42,710
problems that don't seem to have really
efficient solutions but we can still get

1608
00:38:42,710 --> 00:38:42,720
efficient solutions but we can still get
 

1609
00:38:42,720 --> 00:38:45,349
efficient solutions but we can still get
into a lot more with him and so this

1610
00:38:45,349 --> 00:38:45,359
into a lot more with him and so this
 

1611
00:38:45,359 --> 00:38:48,650
into a lot more with him and so this
book that I'm finishing now is I've got

1612
00:38:48,650 --> 00:38:48,660
book that I'm finishing now is I've got
 

1613
00:38:48,660 --> 00:38:51,400
book that I'm finishing now is I've got
a whole bunch of brand new methods that

1614
00:38:51,400 --> 00:38:51,410
a whole bunch of brand new methods that
 

1615
00:38:51,410 --> 00:38:53,420
a whole bunch of brand new methods that
the fires I know there's no other

1616
00:38:53,420 --> 00:38:53,430
the fires I know there's no other
 

1617
00:38:53,430 --> 00:38:57,680
the fires I know there's no other
there's no other book that covers that

1618
00:38:57,680 --> 00:38:57,690
there's no other book that covers that
 

1619
00:38:57,690 --> 00:39:00,380
there's no other book that covers that
covers this particular approach and and

1620
00:39:00,380 --> 00:39:00,390
covers this particular approach and and
 

1621
00:39:00,390 --> 00:39:04,400
covers this particular approach and and
so I'm trying to do my best of exploring

1622
00:39:04,400 --> 00:39:04,410
so I'm trying to do my best of exploring
 

1623
00:39:04,410 --> 00:39:08,000
so I'm trying to do my best of exploring
the tip of the iceberg and and and I try

1624
00:39:08,000 --> 00:39:08,010
the tip of the iceberg and and and I try
 

1625
00:39:08,010 --> 00:39:11,960
the tip of the iceberg and and and I try
out lots of things and and keep keep

1626
00:39:11,960 --> 00:39:11,970
out lots of things and and keep keep
 

1627
00:39:11,970 --> 00:39:14,960
out lots of things and and keep keep
rewriting finding as I find better

1628
00:39:14,960 --> 00:39:14,970
rewriting finding as I find better
 

1629
00:39:14,970 --> 00:39:17,599
rewriting finding as I find better
better method so what's your writing

1630
00:39:17,599 --> 00:39:17,609
better method so what's your writing
 

1631
00:39:17,609 --> 00:39:19,849
better method so what's your writing
process like what's your thinking and

1632
00:39:19,849 --> 00:39:19,859
process like what's your thinking and
 

1633
00:39:19,859 --> 00:39:24,410
process like what's your thinking and
writing process like every day so what's

1634
00:39:24,410 --> 00:39:24,420
writing process like every day so what's
 

1635
00:39:24,420 --> 00:39:25,599
writing process like every day so what's
your routine even

1636
00:39:25,599 --> 00:39:25,609
your routine even
 

1637
00:39:25,609 --> 00:39:29,240
your routine even
yeah I guess it's actually the best

1638
00:39:29,240 --> 00:39:29,250
yeah I guess it's actually the best
 

1639
00:39:29,250 --> 00:39:31,520
yeah I guess it's actually the best
question because I spent seven days a

1640
00:39:31,520 --> 00:39:31,530
question because I spent seven days a
 

1641
00:39:31,530 --> 00:39:32,880
question because I spent seven days a
week

1642
00:39:32,880 --> 00:39:32,890
week
 

1643
00:39:32,890 --> 00:39:35,700
week
you're doing it the most prepares to

1644
00:39:35,700 --> 00:39:35,710
you're doing it the most prepares to
 

1645
00:39:35,710 --> 00:39:41,400
you're doing it the most prepares to
answer it yeah yeah but okay so the

1646
00:39:41,400 --> 00:39:41,410
answer it yeah yeah but okay so the
 

1647
00:39:41,410 --> 00:39:43,999
answer it yeah yeah but okay so the
chair I'm sitting in is where I do

1648
00:39:43,999 --> 00:39:44,009
chair I'm sitting in is where I do
 

1649
00:39:44,009 --> 00:39:47,509
chair I'm sitting in is where I do
that's where the magic happens well

1650
00:39:47,509 --> 00:39:47,519
that's where the magic happens well
 

1651
00:39:47,519 --> 00:39:49,589
that's where the magic happens well
reading and writing that many chairs

1652
00:39:49,589 --> 00:39:49,599
reading and writing that many chairs
 

1653
00:39:49,599 --> 00:39:50,970
reading and writing that many chairs
usually sitting over there where I have

1654
00:39:50,970 --> 00:39:50,980
usually sitting over there where I have
 

1655
00:39:50,980 --> 00:39:53,640
usually sitting over there where I have
other books some reference book but but

1656
00:39:53,640 --> 00:39:53,650
other books some reference book but but
 

1657
00:39:53,650 --> 00:39:58,400
other books some reference book but but
I I found his chair which was designed

1658
00:39:58,400 --> 00:39:58,410
I I found his chair which was designed
 

1659
00:39:58,410 --> 00:40:01,109
I I found his chair which was designed
by a Swedish guy anyway it turns out

1660
00:40:01,109 --> 00:40:01,119
by a Swedish guy anyway it turns out
 

1661
00:40:01,119 --> 00:40:02,759
by a Swedish guy anyway it turns out
this was the only chair I can really sit

1662
00:40:02,759 --> 00:40:02,769
this was the only chair I can really sit
 

1663
00:40:02,769 --> 00:40:04,200
this was the only chair I can really sit
in for hours and hours and not know that

1664
00:40:04,200 --> 00:40:04,210
in for hours and hours and not know that
 

1665
00:40:04,210 --> 00:40:06,479
in for hours and hours and not know that
I'm in a chair but then I have the

1666
00:40:06,479 --> 00:40:06,489
I'm in a chair but then I have the
 

1667
00:40:06,489 --> 00:40:08,880
I'm in a chair but then I have the
stand-up desk right next next to us and

1668
00:40:08,880 --> 00:40:08,890
stand-up desk right next next to us and
 

1669
00:40:08,890 --> 00:40:11,370
stand-up desk right next next to us and
and so after I write something with

1670
00:40:11,370 --> 00:40:11,380
and so after I write something with
 

1671
00:40:11,380 --> 00:40:15,359
and so after I write something with
pencil and eraser I get up and I type it

1672
00:40:15,359 --> 00:40:15,369
pencil and eraser I get up and I type it
 

1673
00:40:15,369 --> 00:40:21,989
pencil and eraser I get up and I type it
and revise and rewrite the kernel the

1674
00:40:21,989 --> 00:40:21,999
and revise and rewrite the kernel the
 

1675
00:40:21,999 --> 00:40:24,960
and revise and rewrite the kernel the
idea is first put on paper yep

1676
00:40:24,960 --> 00:40:24,970
idea is first put on paper yep
 

1677
00:40:24,970 --> 00:40:27,660
idea is first put on paper yep
that's worth right and I call right

1678
00:40:27,660 --> 00:40:27,670
that's worth right and I call right
 

1679
00:40:27,670 --> 00:40:31,499
that's worth right and I call right
maybe five programs a week of course

1680
00:40:31,499 --> 00:40:31,509
maybe five programs a week of course
 

1681
00:40:31,509 --> 00:40:34,620
maybe five programs a week of course
literate programming and these are

1682
00:40:34,620 --> 00:40:34,630
literate programming and these are
 

1683
00:40:34,630 --> 00:40:36,720
literate programming and these are
before I describe something in my book I

1684
00:40:36,720 --> 00:40:36,730
before I describe something in my book I
 

1685
00:40:36,730 --> 00:40:38,220
before I describe something in my book I
always program it to see how it's

1686
00:40:38,220 --> 00:40:38,230
always program it to see how it's
 

1687
00:40:38,230 --> 00:40:42,269
always program it to see how it's
working and I and I tried a lot so for

1688
00:40:42,269 --> 00:40:42,279
working and I and I tried a lot so for
 

1689
00:40:42,279 --> 00:40:44,640
working and I and I tried a lot so for
example I learned at the end of January

1690
00:40:44,640 --> 00:40:44,650
example I learned at the end of January
 

1691
00:40:44,650 --> 00:40:48,620
example I learned at the end of January
I learned of a breakthrough by for

1692
00:40:48,620 --> 00:40:48,630
I learned of a breakthrough by for
 

1693
00:40:48,630 --> 00:40:51,539
I learned of a breakthrough by for
Japanese people who had extended one of

1694
00:40:51,539 --> 00:40:51,549
Japanese people who had extended one of
 

1695
00:40:51,549 --> 00:40:53,759
Japanese people who had extended one of
the one of my methods in in a new

1696
00:40:53,759 --> 00:40:53,769
the one of my methods in in a new
 

1697
00:40:53,769 --> 00:40:56,549
the one of my methods in in a new
direction and so I I spent the next five

1698
00:40:56,549 --> 00:40:56,559
direction and so I I spent the next five
 

1699
00:40:56,559 --> 00:40:59,130
direction and so I I spent the next five
days writing a program to implement what

1700
00:40:59,130 --> 00:40:59,140
days writing a program to implement what
 

1701
00:40:59,140 --> 00:41:01,859
days writing a program to implement what
they did and then I you know but they

1702
00:41:01,859 --> 00:41:01,869
they did and then I you know but they
 

1703
00:41:01,869 --> 00:41:04,440
they did and then I you know but they
had only generalized part of what I had

1704
00:41:04,440 --> 00:41:04,450
had only generalized part of what I had
 

1705
00:41:04,450 --> 00:41:06,299
had only generalized part of what I had
done so that I had to see if I could

1706
00:41:06,299 --> 00:41:06,309
done so that I had to see if I could
 

1707
00:41:06,309 --> 00:41:08,450
done so that I had to see if I could
generalize more parts of it and then I

1708
00:41:08,450 --> 00:41:08,460
generalize more parts of it and then I
 

1709
00:41:08,460 --> 00:41:11,009
generalize more parts of it and then I
had to take their approach and I had to

1710
00:41:11,009 --> 00:41:11,019
had to take their approach and I had to
 

1711
00:41:11,019 --> 00:41:13,859
had to take their approach and I had to
I had to try it out on a couple of dozen

1712
00:41:13,859 --> 00:41:13,869
I had to try it out on a couple of dozen
 

1713
00:41:13,869 --> 00:41:15,839
I had to try it out on a couple of dozen
of the other problems I had already

1714
00:41:15,839 --> 00:41:15,849
of the other problems I had already
 

1715
00:41:15,849 --> 00:41:17,849
of the other problems I had already
worked out with that with my old methods

1716
00:41:17,849 --> 00:41:17,859
worked out with that with my old methods
 

1717
00:41:17,859 --> 00:41:19,950
worked out with that with my old methods
and so that took another couple of weeks

1718
00:41:19,950 --> 00:41:19,960
and so that took another couple of weeks
 

1719
00:41:19,960 --> 00:41:22,229
and so that took another couple of weeks
and then I would you know then I then I

1720
00:41:22,229 --> 00:41:22,239
and then I would you know then I then I
 

1721
00:41:22,239 --> 00:41:26,279
and then I would you know then I then I
started to see the light nicely and and

1722
00:41:26,279 --> 00:41:26,289
started to see the light nicely and and
 

1723
00:41:26,289 --> 00:41:29,150
started to see the light nicely and and
I started writing the final draft and

1724
00:41:29,150 --> 00:41:29,160
I started writing the final draft and
 

1725
00:41:29,160 --> 00:41:32,069
I started writing the final draft and
and then I would you know type it up

1726
00:41:32,069 --> 00:41:32,079
and then I would you know type it up
 

1727
00:41:32,079 --> 00:41:34,829
and then I would you know type it up
involves some new mathematical questions

1728
00:41:34,829 --> 00:41:34,839
involves some new mathematical questions
 

1729
00:41:34,839 --> 00:41:37,319
involves some new mathematical questions
and so I wrote to my friends and might

1730
00:41:37,319 --> 00:41:37,329
and so I wrote to my friends and might
 

1731
00:41:37,329 --> 00:41:39,870
and so I wrote to my friends and might
be good at solving those problems and

1732
00:41:39,870 --> 00:41:39,880
be good at solving those problems and
 

1733
00:41:39,880 --> 00:41:43,499
be good at solving those problems and
and they solve some of them so I put

1734
00:41:43,499 --> 00:41:43,509
and they solve some of them so I put
 

1735
00:41:43,509 --> 00:41:46,950
and they solve some of them so I put
that in his exercises and and so a month

1736
00:41:46,950 --> 00:41:46,960
that in his exercises and and so a month
 

1737
00:41:46,960 --> 00:41:50,520
that in his exercises and and so a month
later I had absorbed one new idea that I

1738
00:41:50,520 --> 00:41:50,530
later I had absorbed one new idea that I
 

1739
00:41:50,530 --> 00:41:53,910
later I had absorbed one new idea that I
that I learned and you know I'm glad I

1740
00:41:53,910 --> 00:41:53,920
that I learned and you know I'm glad I
 

1741
00:41:53,920 --> 00:41:55,740
that I learned and you know I'm glad I
heard about it in time otherwise my I

1742
00:41:55,740 --> 00:41:55,750
heard about it in time otherwise my I
 

1743
00:41:55,750 --> 00:41:57,300
heard about it in time otherwise my I
wouldn't put my book out before I heard

1744
00:41:57,300 --> 00:41:57,310
wouldn't put my book out before I heard
 

1745
00:41:57,310 --> 00:41:59,700
wouldn't put my book out before I heard
about the idea on the other hand this

1746
00:41:59,700 --> 00:41:59,710
about the idea on the other hand this
 

1747
00:41:59,710 --> 00:42:01,980
about the idea on the other hand this
book was supposed to come in at 300

1748
00:42:01,980 --> 00:42:01,990
book was supposed to come in at 300
 

1749
00:42:01,990 --> 00:42:04,770
book was supposed to come in at 300
pages and I'm up to 350 now that added

1750
00:42:04,770 --> 00:42:04,780
pages and I'm up to 350 now that added
 

1751
00:42:04,780 --> 00:42:07,500
pages and I'm up to 350 now that added
10 pages to the book but if I learn

1752
00:42:07,500 --> 00:42:07,510
10 pages to the book but if I learn
 

1753
00:42:07,510 --> 00:42:10,020
10 pages to the book but if I learn
about another one I probably first gonna

1754
00:42:10,020 --> 00:42:10,030
about another one I probably first gonna
 

1755
00:42:10,030 --> 00:42:15,300
about another one I probably first gonna
shoot me well so in the process in that

1756
00:42:15,300 --> 00:42:15,310
shoot me well so in the process in that
 

1757
00:42:15,310 --> 00:42:18,060
shoot me well so in the process in that
one month process are some days harder

1758
00:42:18,060 --> 00:42:18,070
one month process are some days harder
 

1759
00:42:18,070 --> 00:42:20,520
one month process are some days harder
than others are some days harder than

1760
00:42:20,520 --> 00:42:20,530
than others are some days harder than
 

1761
00:42:20,530 --> 00:42:23,310
than others are some days harder than
others well yeah my work is fun but I

1762
00:42:23,310 --> 00:42:23,320
others well yeah my work is fun but I
 

1763
00:42:23,320 --> 00:42:26,700
others well yeah my work is fun but I
also work hard and every big job has

1764
00:42:26,700 --> 00:42:26,710
also work hard and every big job has
 

1765
00:42:26,710 --> 00:42:28,200
also work hard and every big job has
parts that are a lot more fun than

1766
00:42:28,200 --> 00:42:28,210
parts that are a lot more fun than
 

1767
00:42:28,210 --> 00:42:32,130
parts that are a lot more fun than
others and so many days I'll say why do

1768
00:42:32,130 --> 00:42:32,140
others and so many days I'll say why do
 

1769
00:42:32,140 --> 00:42:35,040
others and so many days I'll say why do
I have to have such high standards like

1770
00:42:35,040 --> 00:42:35,050
I have to have such high standards like
 

1771
00:42:35,050 --> 00:42:36,690
I have to have such high standards like
why couldn't I just be sloppy and not

1772
00:42:36,690 --> 00:42:36,700
why couldn't I just be sloppy and not
 

1773
00:42:36,700 --> 00:42:38,400
why couldn't I just be sloppy and not
try this out and you know just just

1774
00:42:38,400 --> 00:42:38,410
try this out and you know just just
 

1775
00:42:38,410 --> 00:42:42,150
try this out and you know just just
report the answer but I but I know that

1776
00:42:42,150 --> 00:42:42,160
report the answer but I but I know that
 

1777
00:42:42,160 --> 00:42:45,720
report the answer but I but I know that
people are conning me to do this and so

1778
00:42:45,720 --> 00:42:45,730
people are conning me to do this and so
 

1779
00:42:45,730 --> 00:42:49,410
people are conning me to do this and so
okay so okay Donald grit my teeth and do

1780
00:42:49,410 --> 00:42:49,420
okay so okay Donald grit my teeth and do
 

1781
00:42:49,420 --> 00:42:52,410
okay so okay Donald grit my teeth and do
it and and and then the joy comes out

1782
00:42:52,410 --> 00:42:52,420
it and and and then the joy comes out
 

1783
00:42:52,420 --> 00:42:54,300
it and and and then the joy comes out
when I see that actually you know I'm

1784
00:42:54,300 --> 00:42:54,310
when I see that actually you know I'm
 

1785
00:42:54,310 --> 00:42:56,609
when I see that actually you know I'm
getting good results and and and I get

1786
00:42:56,609 --> 00:42:56,619
getting good results and and and I get
 

1787
00:42:56,619 --> 00:43:00,060
getting good results and and and I get
and I even more when I see that somebody

1788
00:43:00,060 --> 00:43:00,070
and I even more when I see that somebody
 

1789
00:43:00,070 --> 00:43:02,160
and I even more when I see that somebody
has actually read and understood what I

1790
00:43:02,160 --> 00:43:02,170
has actually read and understood what I
 

1791
00:43:02,170 --> 00:43:04,680
has actually read and understood what I
wrote and told me how to make it even

1792
00:43:04,680 --> 00:43:04,690
wrote and told me how to make it even
 

1793
00:43:04,690 --> 00:43:08,490
wrote and told me how to make it even
better I did want to mention something

1794
00:43:08,490 --> 00:43:08,500
better I did want to mention something
 

1795
00:43:08,500 --> 00:43:12,079
better I did want to mention something
about the about the method so I got this

1796
00:43:12,079 --> 00:43:12,089
about the about the method so I got this
 

1797
00:43:12,089 --> 00:43:19,920
about the about the method so I got this
tablet here where I do the first you

1798
00:43:19,920 --> 00:43:19,930
tablet here where I do the first you
 

1799
00:43:19,930 --> 00:43:23,160
tablet here where I do the first you
know the first writing of concepts okay

1800
00:43:23,160 --> 00:43:23,170
know the first writing of concepts okay
 

1801
00:43:23,170 --> 00:43:27,990
know the first writing of concepts okay
so so and what language I didn't write

1802
00:43:27,990 --> 00:43:28,000
so so and what language I didn't write
 

1803
00:43:28,000 --> 00:43:30,470
so so and what language I didn't write
so hey take a look at but you know here

1804
00:43:30,470 --> 00:43:30,480
so hey take a look at but you know here
 

1805
00:43:30,480 --> 00:43:33,210
so hey take a look at but you know here
random say explain how to draw such

1806
00:43:33,210 --> 00:43:33,220
random say explain how to draw such
 

1807
00:43:33,220 --> 00:43:36,599
random say explain how to draw such
skewed pixel diagrams okay so I got this

1808
00:43:36,599 --> 00:43:36,609
skewed pixel diagrams okay so I got this
 

1809
00:43:36,609 --> 00:43:40,050
skewed pixel diagrams okay so I got this
paper about 40 years ago when I was

1810
00:43:40,050 --> 00:43:40,060
paper about 40 years ago when I was
 

1811
00:43:40,060 --> 00:43:42,690
paper about 40 years ago when I was
visiting my sister in Canada and they

1812
00:43:42,690 --> 00:43:42,700
visiting my sister in Canada and they
 

1813
00:43:42,700 --> 00:43:45,560
visiting my sister in Canada and they
make tablets of paper with this nice

1814
00:43:45,560 --> 00:43:45,570
make tablets of paper with this nice
 

1815
00:43:45,570 --> 00:43:48,570
make tablets of paper with this nice
large size and just the right very small

1816
00:43:48,570 --> 00:43:48,580
large size and just the right very small
 

1817
00:43:48,580 --> 00:43:50,730
large size and just the right very small
space between like oh yeah yeah

1818
00:43:50,730 --> 00:43:50,740
space between like oh yeah yeah
 

1819
00:43:50,740 --> 00:43:58,900
space between like oh yeah yeah
particularly also just yeah

1820
00:43:58,900 --> 00:43:58,910

 

1821
00:43:58,910 --> 00:44:00,279

you know I've got these manuscripts

1822
00:44:00,279 --> 00:44:00,289
you know I've got these manuscripts
 

1823
00:44:00,289 --> 00:44:06,400
you know I've got these manuscripts
going back to the 60s and and and those

1824
00:44:06,400 --> 00:44:06,410
going back to the 60s and and and those
 

1825
00:44:06,410 --> 00:44:09,069
going back to the 60s and and and those
are when I get my ideas on paper okay

1826
00:44:09,069 --> 00:44:09,079
are when I get my ideas on paper okay
 

1827
00:44:09,079 --> 00:44:11,410
are when I get my ideas on paper okay
but I'm a good typist in fact I went to

1828
00:44:11,410 --> 00:44:11,420
but I'm a good typist in fact I went to
 

1829
00:44:11,420 --> 00:44:14,079
but I'm a good typist in fact I went to
type in school when I was when I was in

1830
00:44:14,079 --> 00:44:14,089
type in school when I was when I was in
 

1831
00:44:14,089 --> 00:44:15,700
type in school when I was when I was in
high school and so I can type faster

1832
00:44:15,700 --> 00:44:15,710
high school and so I can type faster
 

1833
00:44:15,710 --> 00:44:18,519
high school and so I can type faster
than I think so then when I do the

1834
00:44:18,519 --> 00:44:18,529
than I think so then when I do the
 

1835
00:44:18,529 --> 00:44:21,160
than I think so then when I do the
editing you know stand up and type then

1836
00:44:21,160 --> 00:44:21,170
editing you know stand up and type then
 

1837
00:44:21,170 --> 00:44:24,130
editing you know stand up and type then
I then I revise this and it comes out a

1838
00:44:24,130 --> 00:44:24,140
I then I revise this and it comes out a
 

1839
00:44:24,140 --> 00:44:27,039
I then I revise this and it comes out a
lot different than what you look for

1840
00:44:27,039 --> 00:44:27,049
lot different than what you look for
 

1841
00:44:27,049 --> 00:44:28,299
lot different than what you look for
style and rhythm and things like that

1842
00:44:28,299 --> 00:44:28,309
style and rhythm and things like that
 

1843
00:44:28,309 --> 00:44:30,880
style and rhythm and things like that
come out at the at the typing state and

1844
00:44:30,880 --> 00:44:30,890
come out at the at the typing state and
 

1845
00:44:30,890 --> 00:44:34,210
come out at the at the typing state and
you type in tack and I type in tack and

1846
00:44:34,210 --> 00:44:34,220
you type in tack and I type in tack and
 

1847
00:44:34,220 --> 00:44:38,890
you type in tack and I type in tack and
can you can you think in tech No so to a

1848
00:44:38,890 --> 00:44:38,900
can you can you think in tech No so to a
 

1849
00:44:38,900 --> 00:44:40,809
can you can you think in tech No so to a
certain extent I have I have only a

1850
00:44:40,809 --> 00:44:40,819
certain extent I have I have only a
 

1851
00:44:40,819 --> 00:44:44,019
certain extent I have I have only a
small number of idioms that I use like

1852
00:44:44,019 --> 00:44:44,029
small number of idioms that I use like
 

1853
00:44:44,029 --> 00:44:45,490
small number of idioms that I use like
you know a beginning or theorem I do

1854
00:44:45,490 --> 00:44:45,500
you know a beginning or theorem I do
 

1855
00:44:45,500 --> 00:44:47,740
you know a beginning or theorem I do
something for displayed equation I do

1856
00:44:47,740 --> 00:44:47,750
something for displayed equation I do
 

1857
00:44:47,750 --> 00:44:50,589
something for displayed equation I do
something and and so on but I but I I

1858
00:44:50,589 --> 00:44:50,599
something and and so on but I but I I
 

1859
00:44:50,599 --> 00:44:54,160
something and and so on but I but I I
have to see it and in the way that it's

1860
00:44:54,160 --> 00:44:54,170
have to see it and in the way that it's
 

1861
00:44:54,170 --> 00:44:56,799
have to see it and in the way that it's
on here yeah right for example touring

1862
00:44:56,799 --> 00:44:56,809
on here yeah right for example touring
 

1863
00:44:56,809 --> 00:44:59,019

00:44:59,019 --> 00:44:59,029
wrote what the other direction
 

1865
00:44:59,029 --> 00:45:03,130

you don't write macros you don't think
 

1867
00:45:03,140 --> 00:45:05,529
you don't write macros you don't think
in macros particularly but when I need a

1868
00:45:05,529 --> 00:45:05,539
in macros particularly but when I need a
 

1869
00:45:05,539 --> 00:45:09,039
in macros particularly but when I need a
macro I'll go ahead and and these and do

1870
00:45:09,039 --> 00:45:09,049
macro I'll go ahead and and these and do
 

1871
00:45:09,049 --> 00:45:11,890
macro I'll go ahead and and these and do
it but but the thing is they I also

1872
00:45:11,890 --> 00:45:11,900
it but but the thing is they I also
 

1873
00:45:11,900 --> 00:45:15,220
it but but the thing is they I also
write to fit I mean I'll I'll change

1874
00:45:15,220 --> 00:45:15,230
write to fit I mean I'll I'll change
 

1875
00:45:15,230 --> 00:45:17,289
write to fit I mean I'll I'll change
something if I can if I can save a line

1876
00:45:17,289 --> 00:45:17,299
something if I can if I can save a line
 

1877
00:45:17,299 --> 00:45:19,839
something if I can if I can save a line
I've got you know it's like haiku I'll

1878
00:45:19,839 --> 00:45:19,849
I've got you know it's like haiku I'll
 

1879
00:45:19,849 --> 00:45:21,579
I've got you know it's like haiku I'll
figure out a way to rewrite the sentence

1880
00:45:21,579 --> 00:45:21,589
figure out a way to rewrite the sentence
 

1881
00:45:21,589 --> 00:45:24,130
figure out a way to rewrite the sentence
so that it'll look better on the page

1882
00:45:24,130 --> 00:45:24,140
so that it'll look better on the page
 

1883
00:45:24,140 --> 00:45:26,950
so that it'll look better on the page
and I shouldn't be wasting my time on

1884
00:45:26,950 --> 00:45:26,960
and I shouldn't be wasting my time on
 

1885
00:45:26,960 --> 00:45:29,170
and I shouldn't be wasting my time on
that but but I can't resist because I

1886
00:45:29,170 --> 00:45:29,180
that but but I can't resist because I
 

1887
00:45:29,180 --> 00:45:32,259
that but but I can't resist because I
know it's only another three percent of

1888
00:45:32,259 --> 00:45:32,269
know it's only another three percent of
 

1889
00:45:32,269 --> 00:45:34,089
know it's only another three percent of
the time or something like that and it

1890
00:45:34,089 --> 00:45:34,099
the time or something like that and it
 

1891
00:45:34,099 --> 00:45:36,870
the time or something like that and it
could also be argued that that is what

1892
00:45:36,870 --> 00:45:36,880
could also be argued that that is what
 

1893
00:45:36,880 --> 00:45:38,319
could also be argued that that is what
life is about

1894
00:45:38,319 --> 00:45:38,329
life is about
 

1895
00:45:38,329 --> 00:45:43,660
life is about
ah yes in fact that's true like like I

1896
00:45:43,660 --> 00:45:43,670
ah yes in fact that's true like like I
 

1897
00:45:43,670 --> 00:45:45,490
ah yes in fact that's true like like I
worked in the garden one day a week and

1898
00:45:45,490 --> 00:45:45,500
worked in the garden one day a week and
 

1899
00:45:45,500 --> 00:45:47,920
worked in the garden one day a week and
that's that's kind of a description of

1900
00:45:47,920 --> 00:45:47,930
that's that's kind of a description of
 

1901
00:45:47,930 --> 00:45:50,130
that's that's kind of a description of
my life is getting rid of weeds you know

1902
00:45:50,130 --> 00:45:50,140
my life is getting rid of weeds you know
 

1903
00:45:50,140 --> 00:45:53,079
my life is getting rid of weeds you know
removing bugs for programs in so you

1904
00:45:53,079 --> 00:45:53,089
removing bugs for programs in so you
 

1905
00:45:53,089 --> 00:45:55,870
removing bugs for programs in so you
know a lot of writers talk about you

1906
00:45:55,870 --> 00:45:55,880
know a lot of writers talk about you
 

1907
00:45:55,880 --> 00:45:57,700
know a lot of writers talk about you
know basically suffering the writing

1908
00:45:57,700 --> 00:45:57,710
know basically suffering the writing
 

1909
00:45:57,710 --> 00:46:00,099
know basically suffering the writing
processes yeah having you know it's

1910
00:46:00,099 --> 00:46:00,109
processes yeah having you know it's
 

1911
00:46:00,109 --> 00:46:02,680
processes yeah having you know it's
extremely difficult and I think of

1912
00:46:02,680 --> 00:46:02,690
extremely difficult and I think of
 

1913
00:46:02,690 --> 00:46:05,799
extremely difficult and I think of
programming especially the or technical

1914
00:46:05,799 --> 00:46:05,809
programming especially the or technical
 

1915
00:46:05,809 --> 00:46:08,140
programming especially the or technical
writing that you're doing can be like

1916
00:46:08,140 --> 00:46:08,150
writing that you're doing can be like
 

1917
00:46:08,150 --> 00:46:11,960
writing that you're doing can be like
that do you find yourself

1918
00:46:11,960 --> 00:46:11,970

 

1919
00:46:11,970 --> 00:46:14,960

methodologically how do you every day

1920
00:46:14,960 --> 00:46:14,970
methodologically how do you every day
 

1921
00:46:14,970 --> 00:46:17,300
methodologically how do you every day
sit down to do the work is it a

1922
00:46:17,300 --> 00:46:17,310
sit down to do the work is it a
 

1923
00:46:17,310 --> 00:46:20,930
sit down to do the work is it a
challenge you kind of say it's you know

1924
00:46:20,930 --> 00:46:20,940
challenge you kind of say it's you know
 

1925
00:46:20,940 --> 00:46:24,630
challenge you kind of say it's you know
oh yeah it's fun

1926
00:46:24,630 --> 00:46:24,640

 

1927
00:46:24,640 --> 00:46:27,870

but it'd be interesting to hear if there

1928
00:46:27,870 --> 00:46:27,880
but it'd be interesting to hear if there
 

1929
00:46:27,880 --> 00:46:29,940
but it'd be interesting to hear if there
are non fun parts that you really

1930
00:46:29,940 --> 00:46:29,950
are non fun parts that you really
 

1931
00:46:29,950 --> 00:46:32,850
are non fun parts that you really
struggle with yes the fun comes with

1932
00:46:32,850 --> 00:46:32,860
struggle with yes the fun comes with
 

1933
00:46:32,860 --> 00:46:36,210
struggle with yes the fun comes with
when I'm able to put together ideas of

1934
00:46:36,210 --> 00:46:36,220
when I'm able to put together ideas of
 

1935
00:46:36,220 --> 00:46:38,670
when I'm able to put together ideas of
to two people who didn't know about each

1936
00:46:38,670 --> 00:46:38,680
to two people who didn't know about each
 

1937
00:46:38,680 --> 00:46:41,070
to two people who didn't know about each
other and and and so I might be the

1938
00:46:41,070 --> 00:46:41,080
other and and and so I might be the
 

1939
00:46:41,080 --> 00:46:42,740
other and and and so I might be the
first person that saw both of their

1940
00:46:42,740 --> 00:46:42,750
first person that saw both of their
 

1941
00:46:42,750 --> 00:46:46,620
first person that saw both of their
ideas and so then you know then I get to

1942
00:46:46,620 --> 00:46:46,630
ideas and so then you know then I get to
 

1943
00:46:46,630 --> 00:46:49,830
ideas and so then you know then I get to
make the synthesis and that gives me a

1944
00:46:49,830 --> 00:46:49,840
make the synthesis and that gives me a
 

1945
00:46:49,840 --> 00:46:52,650
make the synthesis and that gives me a
chance to be creative but the dredge

1946
00:46:52,650 --> 00:46:52,660
chance to be creative but the dredge
 

1947
00:46:52,660 --> 00:46:55,830
chance to be creative but the dredge
work is where I act I've got a chase

1948
00:46:55,830 --> 00:46:55,840
work is where I act I've got a chase
 

1949
00:46:55,840 --> 00:46:58,110
work is where I act I've got a chase
everything down to its root this leads

1950
00:46:58,110 --> 00:46:58,120
everything down to its root this leads
 

1951
00:46:58,120 --> 00:47:00,240
everything down to its root this leads
me into really interesting stuff i mean

1952
00:47:00,240 --> 00:47:00,250
me into really interesting stuff i mean
 

1953
00:47:00,250 --> 00:47:02,970
me into really interesting stuff i mean
like i learned about sanskrit nice yeah

1954
00:47:02,970 --> 00:47:02,980
like i learned about sanskrit nice yeah
 

1955
00:47:02,980 --> 00:47:05,790
like i learned about sanskrit nice yeah
and again you know I try to give credit

1956
00:47:05,790 --> 00:47:05,800
and again you know I try to give credit
 

1957
00:47:05,800 --> 00:47:07,740
and again you know I try to give credit
to all the authors and so I write like

1958
00:47:07,740 --> 00:47:07,750
to all the authors and so I write like
 

1959
00:47:07,750 --> 00:47:11,160
to all the authors and so I write like
so I write to people who know that the

1960
00:47:11,160 --> 00:47:11,170
so I write to people who know that the
 

1961
00:47:11,170 --> 00:47:13,220
so I write to people who know that the
people thought as if they're dead I

1962
00:47:13,220 --> 00:47:13,230
people thought as if they're dead I
 

1963
00:47:13,230 --> 00:47:17,250
people thought as if they're dead I
communicate this way I and I gotta get

1964
00:47:17,250 --> 00:47:17,260
communicate this way I and I gotta get
 

1965
00:47:17,260 --> 00:47:19,920
communicate this way I and I gotta get
the math right and I got a tack all my

1966
00:47:19,920 --> 00:47:19,930
the math right and I got a tack all my
 

1967
00:47:19,930 --> 00:47:23,070
the math right and I got a tack all my
programs try to find holes in them and I

1968
00:47:23,070 --> 00:47:23,080
programs try to find holes in them and I
 

1969
00:47:23,080 --> 00:47:25,440
programs try to find holes in them and I
rewrite the programs over after I get a

1970
00:47:25,440 --> 00:47:25,450
rewrite the programs over after I get a
 

1971
00:47:25,450 --> 00:47:26,370
rewrite the programs over after I get a
better idea

1972
00:47:26,370 --> 00:47:26,380
better idea
 

1973
00:47:26,380 --> 00:47:29,610
better idea
is there ever dead-ends data and so yeah

1974
00:47:29,610 --> 00:47:29,620
is there ever dead-ends data and so yeah
 

1975
00:47:29,620 --> 00:47:32,460
is there ever dead-ends data and so yeah
I throw stuff out yeah look one of the

1976
00:47:32,460 --> 00:47:32,470
I throw stuff out yeah look one of the
 

1977
00:47:32,470 --> 00:47:35,220
I throw stuff out yeah look one of the
things that I spent a lot of time

1978
00:47:35,220 --> 00:47:35,230
things that I spent a lot of time
 

1979
00:47:35,230 --> 00:47:38,220
things that I spent a lot of time
preparing a major example based on the

1980
00:47:38,220 --> 00:47:38,230
preparing a major example based on the
 

1981
00:47:38,230 --> 00:47:41,760
preparing a major example based on the
game of baseball and I know a lot of

1982
00:47:41,760 --> 00:47:41,770
game of baseball and I know a lot of
 

1983
00:47:41,770 --> 00:47:44,760
game of baseball and I know a lot of
people who for whom baseball is the most

1984
00:47:44,760 --> 00:47:44,770
people who for whom baseball is the most
 

1985
00:47:44,770 --> 00:47:46,200
people who for whom baseball is the most
important thing in the world you know

1986
00:47:46,200 --> 00:47:46,210
important thing in the world you know
 

1987
00:47:46,210 --> 00:47:47,700
important thing in the world you know
yes but it's but I also know a lot of

1988
00:47:47,700 --> 00:47:47,710
yes but it's but I also know a lot of
 

1989
00:47:47,710 --> 00:47:49,770
yes but it's but I also know a lot of
people from cricket is the most

1990
00:47:49,770 --> 00:47:49,780
people from cricket is the most
 

1991
00:47:49,780 --> 00:47:52,620
people from cricket is the most
important in the world or suck or

1992
00:47:52,620 --> 00:47:52,630
important in the world or suck or
 

1993
00:47:52,630 --> 00:47:55,650
important in the world or suck or
something you know and and I realized

1994
00:47:55,650 --> 00:47:55,660
something you know and and I realized
 

1995
00:47:55,660 --> 00:47:58,260
something you know and and I realized
that if if I had a big sample I mean it

1996
00:47:58,260 --> 00:47:58,270
that if if I had a big sample I mean it
 

1997
00:47:58,270 --> 00:47:59,760
that if if I had a big sample I mean it
was gonna have a fold-out illustration

1998
00:47:59,760 --> 00:47:59,770
was gonna have a fold-out illustration
 

1999
00:47:59,770 --> 00:48:01,470
was gonna have a fold-out illustration
and everything I was saying well what

2000
00:48:01,470 --> 00:48:01,480
and everything I was saying well what
 

2001
00:48:01,480 --> 00:48:02,730
and everything I was saying well what
what am I really teaching about

2002
00:48:02,730 --> 00:48:02,740
what am I really teaching about
 

2003
00:48:02,740 --> 00:48:05,070
what am I really teaching about
algorithms here where I had this this is

2004
00:48:05,070 --> 00:48:05,080
algorithms here where I had this this is
 

2005
00:48:05,080 --> 00:48:07,740
algorithms here where I had this this is
this baseball example and if I was a

2006
00:48:07,740 --> 00:48:07,750
this baseball example and if I was a
 

2007
00:48:07,750 --> 00:48:10,140
this baseball example and if I was a
person who who knew only cricket

2008
00:48:10,140 --> 00:48:10,150
person who who knew only cricket
 

2009
00:48:10,150 --> 00:48:12,090
person who who knew only cricket
wouldn't think what would they think

2010
00:48:12,090 --> 00:48:12,100
wouldn't think what would they think
 

2011
00:48:12,100 --> 00:48:14,340
wouldn't think what would they think
about this and and so I ripped the whole

2012
00:48:14,340 --> 00:48:14,350
about this and and so I ripped the whole
 

2013
00:48:14,350 --> 00:48:17,000
about this and and so I ripped the whole
thing out but I you know I had I had a

2014
00:48:17,000 --> 00:48:17,010
thing out but I you know I had I had a
 

2015
00:48:17,010 --> 00:48:19,050
thing out but I you know I had I had a
something that would really appeal to

2016
00:48:19,050 --> 00:48:19,060
something that would really appeal to
 

2017
00:48:19,060 --> 00:48:21,530
something that would really appeal to
people who grew up with baseball as as

2018
00:48:21,530 --> 00:48:21,540
people who grew up with baseball as as
 

2019
00:48:21,540 --> 00:48:24,390
people who grew up with baseball as as

in the art of programming why why is
there of the few words in the title why

2032
00:48:45,210 --> 00:48:45,220
there of the few words in the title why
 

2033
00:48:45,220 --> 00:48:47,420
there of the few words in the title why
is art one of them yeah well that's

2034
00:48:47,420 --> 00:48:47,430
is art one of them yeah well that's
 

2035
00:48:47,430 --> 00:48:49,980
is art one of them yeah well that's
that's what I wrote my Turing lecture

2036
00:48:49,980 --> 00:48:49,990
that's what I wrote my Turing lecture
 

2037
00:48:49,990 --> 00:48:53,370
that's what I wrote my Turing lecture
about and and so when people talk about

2038
00:48:53,370 --> 00:48:53,380
about and and so when people talk about
 

2039
00:48:53,380 --> 00:48:57,090
about and and so when people talk about
art it really I mean what the word means

2040
00:48:57,090 --> 00:48:57,100
art it really I mean what the word means
 

2041
00:48:57,100 --> 00:49:02,850
art it really I mean what the word means
is something that's not a nature so when

2042
00:49:02,850 --> 00:49:02,860
is something that's not a nature so when
 

2043
00:49:02,860 --> 00:49:05,030
is something that's not a nature so when
you have artificial intelligence that

00:49:09,490 --> 00:49:11,970
that art come from the same root saying
that this is something that was created

00:51:24,570 --> 00:51:24,580
invented until 1986 and here comes a
 

2123
00:51:24,580 --> 00:51:27,030
invented until 1986 and here comes a

way to represent a boolean function and
 

2127
00:51:29,070 --> 00:51:32,340
way to represent a boolean function and
boolean functions are so basic to all

2128
00:51:32,340 --> 00:51:32,350
boolean functions are so basic to all
 

2129
00:51:32,350 --> 00:51:37,040
boolean functions are so basic to all
kinds of things in it I mean logically

2130
00:51:37,040 --> 00:51:37,050
kinds of things in it I mean logically
 

2131
00:51:37,050 --> 00:51:40,580
kinds of things in it I mean logically
underlies it everything we can describe

2132
00:51:40,580 --> 00:51:40,590
underlies it everything we can describe
 

2133
00:51:40,590 --> 00:51:43,530
underlies it everything we can describe
all of what we know in terms of logic

2134
00:51:43,530 --> 00:51:43,540
all of what we know in terms of logic
 

2135
00:51:43,540 --> 00:51:46,970
all of what we know in terms of logic
somehow and and here and and

2136
00:51:46,970 --> 00:51:46,980
somehow and and here and and
 

2137
00:51:46,980 --> 00:51:51,470
somehow and and here and and
propositional logic I thought that was

cutting Dryden everything was known but

2140
00:51:54,180 --> 00:51:54,190
cutting Dryden everything was known but
 

2141
00:51:54,190 --> 00:51:59,280
cutting Dryden everything was known but
but but he but here comes a Randy Bryant

2142
00:51:59,280 --> 00:51:59,290
but but he but here comes a Randy Bryant
 

2143
00:51:59,290 --> 00:52:02,990
but but he but here comes a Randy Bryant
and oh and discovers that BDDs are

2144
00:52:02,990 --> 00:52:03,000
and oh and discovers that BDDs are
 

2145
00:52:03,000 --> 00:52:07,710
and oh and discovers that BDDs are
incredibly powerful then then that's all

2146
00:52:07,710 --> 00:52:07,720
incredibly powerful then then that's all
 

2147
00:52:07,720 --> 00:52:11,490
incredibly powerful then then that's all
so I that mean means I have a whole new

2148
00:52:11,490 --> 00:52:11,500
so I that mean means I have a whole new
 

2149
00:52:11,500 --> 00:52:13,830
so I that mean means I have a whole new

2153
00:52:15,609 --> 00:52:18,570
have thought of until 1986
not until 1990s when I went when people

2154
00:52:18,570 --> 00:52:18,580
not until 1990s when I went when people
 

2155
00:52:18,580 --> 00:52:23,160
not until 1990s when I went when people
started to got to use it for you know

2156
00:52:23,160 --> 00:52:23,170
started to got to use it for you know
 

2157
00:52:23,170 --> 00:52:26,520
started to got to use it for you know
billion dollar of applications and it

2158
00:52:26,520 --> 00:52:26,530

2159
00:52:26,530 --> 00:52:28,710
billion dollar of applications and it
was it was the standard way to design

2160
00:52:28,710 --> 00:52:28,720

2165
00:52:33,580 --> 00:52:35,490
sad solvers came along when in the year
2000 so that's another great big

2166
00:52:35,490 --> 00:52:35,500
2000 so that's another great big
 

2167
00:52:35,500 --> 00:52:38,670
2000 so that's another great big
surprise so uh a lot of these things

2169
00:52:38,680 --> 00:52:40,830

have have totally changed the structure

2170
00:52:40,830 --> 00:52:40,840
have have totally changed the structure

00:52:40,840 --> 00:52:44,340
have have totally changed the structure

volume four B's is about that solvers

2174
00:52:46,740 --> 00:52:46,750
volume four B's is about that solvers
 

2175
00:52:46,750 --> 00:52:49,050
volume four B's is about that solvers
and that's

2176
00:52:49,050 --> 00:52:49,060
and that's
 

2177
00:52:49,060 --> 00:52:53,730
and that's
300 plus pages which is which is all

2178
00:52:53,730 --> 00:52:53,740
300 plus pages which is which is all
 

2179
00:52:53,740 --> 00:52:56,099
300 plus pages which is which is all
about material mostly about material

2180
00:52:56,099 --> 00:52:56,109
about material mostly about material
 

2181
00:52:56,109 --> 00:52:59,190
about material mostly about material
that was discovered in this century and

2182
00:52:59,190 --> 00:52:59,200
that was discovered in this century and
 

2183
00:52:59,200 --> 00:53:03,030
that was discovered in this century and
I had to start from scratch and meet all

2184
00:53:03,030 --> 00:53:03,040
I had to start from scratch and meet all
 

2185
00:53:03,040 --> 00:53:05,670
I had to start from scratch and meet all
the people in the field and right

00:53:05,670 --> 00:53:05,680
the people in the field and right

are described in the book others were

2192
00:53:13,170 --> 00:53:13,180
are described in the book others were
 

2193
00:53:13,180 --> 00:53:16,620
are described in the book others were
for my own experience so newly invented

2194
00:53:16,620 --> 00:53:16,630
for my own experience so newly invented

data structures or ways to represent a

2196
00:53:20,059 --> 00:53:20,069
data structures or ways to represent a
 

2197
00:53:20,069 --> 00:53:22,890
data structures or ways to represent a
whole new class of algorithm calling you

2198
00:53:22,890 --> 00:53:22,900
whole new class of algorithm calling you
 

2199
00:53:22,900 --> 00:53:24,510
whole new class of algorithm calling you
classified yeah and the interesting

2200
00:53:24,510 --> 00:53:24,520
classified yeah and the interesting
 

2201
00:53:24,520 --> 00:53:28,770
classified yeah and the interesting
thing about the BD DS was that the

2202
00:53:28,770 --> 00:53:28,780
thing about the BD DS was that the
 

2203
00:53:28,780 --> 00:53:31,819
thing about the BD DS was that the
theoretician started looking at it and

2204
00:53:31,819 --> 00:53:31,829
theoretician started looking at it and
 

2205
00:53:31,829 --> 00:53:33,930
theoretician started looking at it and
started to describe all the things you

2206
00:53:33,930 --> 00:53:33,940
started to describe all the things you
 

2207
00:53:33,940 --> 00:53:37,650
started to describe all the things you
couldn't do with BD DS and so they were

2208
00:53:37,650 --> 00:53:37,660
couldn't do with BD DS and so they were
 

2209
00:53:37,660 --> 00:53:39,750
couldn't do with BD DS and so they were
getting a bad they were getting a bad

2210
00:53:39,750 --> 00:53:39,760
getting a bad they were getting a bad
 

2211
00:53:39,760 --> 00:53:43,740
getting a bad they were getting a bad
name because you know okay they were

2212
00:53:43,740 --> 00:53:43,750
name because you know okay they were
 

2213
00:53:43,750 --> 00:53:46,620
name because you know okay they were
they were useful but they didn't solve

2214
00:53:46,620 --> 00:53:46,630
they were useful but they didn't solve
 

2215
00:53:46,630 --> 00:53:48,900
they were useful but they didn't solve
everything I'm sure that the

2216
00:53:48,900 --> 00:53:48,910
everything I'm sure that the
 

2217
00:53:48,910 --> 00:53:51,450
everything I'm sure that the
theoreticians are in the next 10 years

2218
00:53:51,450 --> 00:53:51,460
theoreticians are in the next 10 years
 

2219
00:53:51,460 --> 00:53:54,450
theoreticians are in the next 10 years
are gonna show why machine learning

2220
00:53:54,450 --> 00:53:54,460
are gonna show why machine learning
 

2221
00:53:54,460 --> 00:53:58,140
are gonna show why machine learning
doesn't solve everything but I not only

2222
00:53:58,140 --> 00:53:58,150
doesn't solve everything but I not only
 

2223
00:53:58,150 --> 00:54:00,120
doesn't solve everything but I not only
worried about the worst case I get a

2224
00:54:00,120 --> 00:54:00,130
worried about the worst case I get a
 

2225
00:54:00,130 --> 00:54:02,480
worried about the worst case I get a
huge delight when I can actually solve a

2226
00:54:02,480 --> 00:54:02,490
huge delight when I can actually solve a
 

2227
00:54:02,490 --> 00:54:04,470
huge delight when I can actually solve a
problem that I couldn't solve before

2228
00:54:04,470 --> 00:54:04,480
problem that I couldn't solve before
 

2229
00:54:04,480 --> 00:54:07,050
problem that I couldn't solve before
yeah even though I can't solve the

2230
00:54:07,050 --> 00:54:07,060
yeah even though I can't solve the
 

2231
00:54:07,060 --> 00:54:09,599
yeah even though I can't solve the
problem that's that it suggests as a

2232
00:54:09,599 --> 00:54:09,609
problem that's that it suggests as a
 

2233
00:54:09,609 --> 00:54:12,839
problem that's that it suggests as a
further problem like I know that I'm Way

2234
00:54:12,839 --> 00:54:12,849
further problem like I know that I'm Way
 

2235
00:54:12,849 --> 00:54:14,700
further problem like I know that I'm Way
better than I was before and so I found

2236
00:54:14,700 --> 00:54:14,710
better than I was before and so I found
 

2237
00:54:14,710 --> 00:54:17,450
better than I was before and so I found
out that BD DS could do all kinds of

2238
00:54:17,450 --> 00:54:17,460
out that BD DS could do all kinds of
 

2239
00:54:17,460 --> 00:54:24,960
out that BD DS could do all kinds of
miraculous things and so I had been

2240
00:54:24,960 --> 00:54:24,970
miraculous things and so I had been
 

2241
00:54:24,970 --> 00:54:28,920
miraculous things and so I had been
quite a few years learning about the

2242
00:54:28,920 --> 00:54:28,930
quite a few years learning about the
 

2243
00:54:28,930 --> 00:54:32,400
quite a few years learning about the
that territory so in general what brings

2244
00:54:32,400 --> 00:54:32,410
that territory so in general what brings
 

2245
00:54:32,410 --> 00:54:36,990
that territory so in general what brings
you more pleasure in proving or showing

2246
00:54:36,990 --> 00:54:37,000
you more pleasure in proving or showing
 

2247
00:54:37,000 --> 00:54:40,760
you more pleasure in proving or showing
a worst case analysis of an algorithm or

2248
00:54:40,760 --> 00:54:40,770
a worst case analysis of an algorithm or
 

2249
00:54:40,770 --> 00:54:43,920
a worst case analysis of an algorithm or
showing a good average case or just

2250
00:54:43,920 --> 00:54:43,930
showing a good average case or just
 

2251
00:54:43,930 --> 00:54:46,140
showing a good average case or just
showing a good case that you know

2252
00:54:46,140 --> 00:54:46,150
showing a good case that you know
 

2253
00:54:46,150 --> 00:54:47,970
showing a good case that you know
something good pragmatically can be done

2254
00:54:47,970 --> 00:54:47,980
something good pragmatically can be done
 

2255
00:54:47,980 --> 00:54:50,069
something good pragmatically can be done
with this algorithm yeah I like a good

2256
00:54:50,069 --> 00:54:50,079
with this algorithm yeah I like a good
 

2257
00:54:50,079 --> 00:54:53,130
with this algorithm yeah I like a good
case that that is maybe only a million

2258
00:54:53,130 --> 00:54:53,140
case that that is maybe only a million
 

2259
00:54:53,140 --> 00:54:54,720
case that that is maybe only a million
times faster than I was able to do

2260
00:54:54,720 --> 00:54:54,730
times faster than I was able to do
 

2261
00:54:54,730 --> 00:54:57,300
times faster than I was able to do
before but and not worried about the

2262
00:54:57,300 --> 00:54:57,310
before but and not worried about the
 

2263
00:54:57,310 --> 00:54:58,510
before but and not worried about the
fact that

2264
00:54:58,510 --> 00:54:58,520
fact that
 

2265
00:54:58,520 --> 00:55:01,570
fact that
and that is still that is still gonna

2266
00:55:01,570 --> 00:55:01,580
and that is still that is still gonna
 

2267
00:55:01,580 --> 00:55:03,580
and that is still that is still gonna
take too long if I double the size of

2268
00:55:03,580 --> 00:55:03,590
take too long if I double the size of
 

2269
00:55:03,590 --> 00:55:08,230
take too long if I double the size of
the problem so that said you popularize

2270
00:55:08,230 --> 00:55:08,240
the problem so that said you popularize
 

2271
00:55:08,240 --> 00:55:10,950
the problem so that said you popularize
the asymptotic notation for describing

2272
00:55:10,950 --> 00:55:10,960
the asymptotic notation for describing
 

2273
00:55:10,960 --> 00:55:14,200
the asymptotic notation for describing
running time obviously in the analysis

2274
00:55:14,200 --> 00:55:14,210
running time obviously in the analysis
 

2275
00:55:14,210 --> 00:55:17,050
running time obviously in the analysis
of algorithms worst cases such as such

2276
00:55:17,050 --> 00:55:17,060
of algorithms worst cases such as such
 

2277
00:55:17,060 --> 00:55:20,230
of algorithms worst cases such as such
an important part do you see any aspects

2278
00:55:20,230 --> 00:55:20,240
an important part do you see any aspects
 

2279
00:55:20,240 --> 00:55:24,550
an important part do you see any aspects
of that kind of analysis is lacking so

2280
00:55:24,550 --> 00:55:24,560
of that kind of analysis is lacking so
 

2281
00:55:24,560 --> 00:55:28,390
of that kind of analysis is lacking so
and notation - well the main purpose you

2282
00:55:28,390 --> 00:55:28,400
and notation - well the main purpose you
 

2283
00:55:28,400 --> 00:55:32,050
and notation - well the main purpose you
have notations that that help us for the

2284
00:55:32,050 --> 00:55:32,060
have notations that that help us for the
 

2285
00:55:32,060 --> 00:55:33,550
have notations that that help us for the
problems we want to solve and so that

2286
00:55:33,550 --> 00:55:33,560
problems we want to solve and so that
 

2287
00:55:33,560 --> 00:55:36,010
problems we want to solve and so that
they match our they match our intuitions

2288
00:55:36,010 --> 00:55:36,020
they match our they match our intuitions
 

2289
00:55:36,020 --> 00:55:38,740
they match our they match our intuitions
and people who worked in number theory

2290
00:55:38,740 --> 00:55:38,750
and people who worked in number theory
 

2291
00:55:38,750 --> 00:55:41,530
and people who worked in number theory
had used asymptotic notation in what

2292
00:55:41,530 --> 00:55:41,540
had used asymptotic notation in what
 

2293
00:55:41,540 --> 00:55:44,620
had used asymptotic notation in what
Ennis in a certain way but it was only

2294
00:55:44,620 --> 00:55:44,630
Ennis in a certain way but it was only
 

2295
00:55:44,630 --> 00:55:46,750
Ennis in a certain way but it was only
known to a small group of people and and

2296
00:55:46,750 --> 00:55:46,760
known to a small group of people and and
 

2297
00:55:46,760 --> 00:55:50,170
known to a small group of people and and
I realized that in fact it was very

2298
00:55:50,170 --> 00:55:50,180
I realized that in fact it was very
 

2299
00:55:50,180 --> 00:55:52,690
I realized that in fact it was very
useful to be able to have a notation for

2300
00:55:52,690 --> 00:55:52,700
useful to be able to have a notation for
 

2301
00:55:52,700 --> 00:55:54,220
useful to be able to have a notation for
something that we don't know exactly

2302
00:55:54,220 --> 00:55:54,230
something that we don't know exactly
 

2303
00:55:54,230 --> 00:55:56,500
something that we don't know exactly
what it is but we only know partial

2304
00:55:56,500 --> 00:55:56,510
what it is but we only know partial
 

2305
00:55:56,510 --> 00:56:00,310
what it is but we only know partial
about it and so on stick so for example

2306
00:56:00,310 --> 00:56:00,320
about it and so on stick so for example
 

2307
00:56:00,320 --> 00:56:02,530
about it and so on stick so for example
instead of Big O notation let's just

2308
00:56:02,530 --> 00:56:02,540
instead of Big O notation let's just
 

2309
00:56:02,540 --> 00:56:04,540
instead of Big O notation let's just
let's just take us a much simpler

2310
00:56:04,540 --> 00:56:04,550
let's just take us a much simpler
 

2311
00:56:04,550 --> 00:56:09,640
let's just take us a much simpler
notation where I say 0 or 1 or 0 1 or 2

2312
00:56:09,640 --> 00:56:09,650
notation where I say 0 or 1 or 0 1 or 2
 

2313
00:56:09,650 --> 00:56:13,030
notation where I say 0 or 1 or 0 1 or 2
and suppose that suppose that when I had

2314
00:56:13,030 --> 00:56:13,040
and suppose that suppose that when I had
 

2315
00:56:13,040 --> 00:56:15,609
and suppose that suppose that when I had
been in high school we would be allowed

2316
00:56:15,609 --> 00:56:15,619
been in high school we would be allowed
 

2317
00:56:15,619 --> 00:56:18,640
been in high school we would be allowed
to put in the middle of our formula x +

2318
00:56:18,640 --> 00:56:18,650
to put in the middle of our formula x +
 

2319
00:56:18,650 --> 00:56:24,580
to put in the middle of our formula x +
0 1 or 2 equals y okay and then then we

2320
00:56:24,580 --> 00:56:24,590
0 1 or 2 equals y okay and then then we
 

2321
00:56:24,590 --> 00:56:27,460
0 1 or 2 equals y okay and then then we
would learn how to multiply two such

2322
00:56:27,460 --> 00:56:27,470
would learn how to multiply two such
 

2323
00:56:27,470 --> 00:56:30,599
would learn how to multiply two such
expressions together and and you know

2324
00:56:30,599 --> 00:56:30,609
expressions together and and you know
 

2325
00:56:30,609 --> 00:56:32,440
expressions together and and you know
deal with them

2326
00:56:32,440 --> 00:56:32,450
deal with them
 

2327
00:56:32,450 --> 00:56:34,620
deal with them
well the same thing Big O notation says

2328
00:56:34,620 --> 00:56:34,630
well the same thing Big O notation says
 

2329
00:56:34,630 --> 00:56:38,500
well the same thing Big O notation says
here's something that's I'm not sure

2330
00:56:38,500 --> 00:56:38,510
here's something that's I'm not sure
 

2331
00:56:38,510 --> 00:56:40,680
here's something that's I'm not sure
what it is but I know it's not too big I

2332
00:56:40,680 --> 00:56:40,690
what it is but I know it's not too big I
 

2333
00:56:40,690 --> 00:56:43,180
what it is but I know it's not too big I
know it's not bigger than some constant

2334
00:56:43,180 --> 00:56:43,190
know it's not bigger than some constant
 

2335
00:56:43,190 --> 00:56:44,740
know it's not bigger than some constant
times N squared or something like that

2336
00:56:44,740 --> 00:56:44,750
times N squared or something like that
 

2337
00:56:44,750 --> 00:56:47,349
times N squared or something like that
fine so I write Big O of N squared and

2338
00:56:47,349 --> 00:56:47,359
fine so I write Big O of N squared and
 

2339
00:56:47,359 --> 00:56:49,660
fine so I write Big O of N squared and
now I learned how to add Big O of N

2340
00:56:49,660 --> 00:56:49,670
now I learned how to add Big O of N
 

2341
00:56:49,670 --> 00:56:51,310
now I learned how to add Big O of N
squared to Big O of N cubed and I know

2342
00:56:51,310 --> 00:56:51,320
squared to Big O of N cubed and I know
 

2343
00:56:51,320 --> 00:56:54,940
squared to Big O of N cubed and I know
how to add Big O of N squared 2 plus 1

2344
00:56:54,940 --> 00:56:54,950
how to add Big O of N squared 2 plus 1
 

2345
00:56:54,950 --> 00:56:56,980
how to add Big O of N squared 2 plus 1
and square that and how to take

2346
00:56:56,980 --> 00:56:56,990
and square that and how to take
 

2347
00:56:56,990 --> 00:56:58,840
and square that and how to take
logarithms and Exponential's to have big

2348
00:56:58,840 --> 00:56:58,850
logarithms and Exponential's to have big
 

2349
00:56:58,850 --> 00:57:01,570
logarithms and Exponential's to have big
O's in the middle of them and that

2350
00:57:01,570 --> 00:57:01,580
O's in the middle of them and that
 

2351
00:57:01,580 --> 00:57:04,930
O's in the middle of them and that
turned out to be hugely valuable in all

2352
00:57:04,930 --> 00:57:04,940
turned out to be hugely valuable in all
 

2353
00:57:04,940 --> 00:57:06,370
turned out to be hugely valuable in all
of the work that I was trying to do is

2354
00:57:06,370 --> 00:57:06,380
of the work that I was trying to do is
 

2355
00:57:06,380 --> 00:57:08,630
of the work that I was trying to do is
I'm trying to figure out how good

2356
00:57:08,630 --> 00:57:08,640
I'm trying to figure out how good
 

2357
00:57:08,640 --> 00:57:12,150
I'm trying to figure out how good
so I have there been algorithms in your

2358
00:57:12,150 --> 00:57:12,160
so I have there been algorithms in your
 

2359
00:57:12,160 --> 00:57:15,810
so I have there been algorithms in your
journey that perform very differently in

2360
00:57:15,810 --> 00:57:15,820
journey that perform very differently in
 

2361
00:57:15,820 --> 00:57:19,110
journey that perform very differently in
practice than they do in theory well the

2362
00:57:19,110 --> 00:57:19,120
practice than they do in theory well the
 

2363
00:57:19,120 --> 00:57:21,450
practice than they do in theory well the
worst case of a comet our logarithm is

2364
00:57:21,450 --> 00:57:21,460
worst case of a comet our logarithm is
 

2365
00:57:21,460 --> 00:57:26,340
worst case of a comet our logarithm is
almost always horrible but but we have

2366
00:57:26,340 --> 00:57:26,350
almost always horrible but but we have
 

2367
00:57:26,350 --> 00:57:28,590
almost always horrible but but we have
sad solvers that are solving where one

2368
00:57:28,590 --> 00:57:28,600
sad solvers that are solving where one
 

2369
00:57:28,600 --> 00:57:31,490
sad solvers that are solving where one
of the one of the last exercises in that

2370
00:57:31,490 --> 00:57:31,500
of the one of the last exercises in that
 

2371
00:57:31,500 --> 00:57:34,910
of the one of the last exercises in that
part of my book was to figure out a

2372
00:57:34,910 --> 00:57:34,920
part of my book was to figure out a
 

2373
00:57:34,920 --> 00:57:37,080
part of my book was to figure out a
problem that has a hundred variables

2374
00:57:37,080 --> 00:57:37,090
problem that has a hundred variables
 

2375
00:57:37,090 --> 00:57:40,190
problem that has a hundred variables
that's that's difficult for us at solver

2376
00:57:40,190 --> 00:57:40,200
that's that's difficult for us at solver
 

2377
00:57:40,200 --> 00:57:42,860
that's that's difficult for us at solver
but uh but you would think that a

2378
00:57:42,860 --> 00:57:42,870
but uh but you would think that a
 

2379
00:57:42,870 --> 00:57:44,610
but uh but you would think that a
problem with the hundred boolean

2380
00:57:44,610 --> 00:57:44,620
problem with the hundred boolean
 

2381
00:57:44,620 --> 00:57:47,310
problem with the hundred boolean
variables has required to do 2 to the

2382
00:57:47,310 --> 00:57:47,320
variables has required to do 2 to the
 

2383
00:57:47,320 --> 00:57:51,630
variables has required to do 2 to the
100th operations because that's the

2384
00:57:51,630 --> 00:57:51,640
100th operations because that's the
 

2385
00:57:51,640 --> 00:57:53,100
100th operations because that's the
number of possibilities when you have

2386
00:57:53,100 --> 00:57:53,110
number of possibilities when you have
 

2387
00:57:53,110 --> 00:57:56,120
number of possibilities when you have
200 boolean variables in 2 to the 100th

2388
00:57:56,120 --> 00:57:56,130
200 boolean variables in 2 to the 100th
 

2389
00:57:56,130 --> 00:57:59,700
200 boolean variables in 2 to the 100th
to the 100th is way bigger than then we

00:57:59,700 --> 00:57:59,710
to the 100th is way bigger than then we
 

2391
00:57:59,710 --> 00:58:02,570
to the 100th is way bigger than then we
can handle 10 to the 17th is a lot

00:58:02,570 --> 00:58:02,580
can handle 10 to the 17th is a lot
 

2393

can handle 10 to the 17th is a lot
you've mentioned over the past few years

2394
00:58:04,800 --> 00:58:04,810
you've mentioned over the past few years
 

2395
00:58:04,810 --> 00:58:07,610
you've mentioned over the past few years
that you believe P may be equal to NP

2396
00:58:07,610 --> 00:58:07,620
that you believe P may be equal to NP
 

2397
00:58:07,620 --> 00:58:11,550
that you believe P may be equal to NP
but that it's not really you know

2398
00:58:11,550 --> 00:58:11,560
but that it's not really you know
 

2399
00:58:11,560 --> 00:58:14,100
but that it's not really you know
somebody does prove that P equals NP it

2400
00:58:14,100 --> 00:58:14,110
somebody does prove that P equals NP it
 

2401
00:58:14,110 --> 00:58:16,020
somebody does prove that P equals NP it
will not directly lead to an actual

00:58:16,020 --> 00:58:16,030
will not directly lead to an actual
 

2403
00:58:16,030 --> 00:58:19,100
will not directly lead to an actual
algorithm to solve difficult problems

2404
00:58:19,100 --> 00:58:19,110
algorithm to solve difficult problems
 

2405
00:58:19,110 --> 00:58:21,720
algorithm to solve difficult problems
can you explain your intuition here has

2406
00:58:21,720 --> 00:58:21,730
can you explain your intuition here has
 

2407
00:58:21,730 --> 00:58:24,720
can you explain your intuition here has
it been changed and in general on the

2408
00:58:24,720 --> 00:58:24,730
it been changed and in general on the
 

2409
00:58:24,730 --> 00:58:26,070
it been changed and in general on the
difference between easy and difficult

difference between easy and difficult
 

2411
00:58:26,080 --> 00:58:29,490
difference between easy and difficult
problems of P and NP and so on yes so

2412
00:58:29,490 --> 00:58:29,500
problems of P and NP and so on yes so
 

2413
00:58:29,500 --> 00:58:33,330
problems of P and NP and so on yes so
the popular idea is if an algorithm

2414
00:58:33,330 --> 00:58:33,340
the popular idea is if an algorithm
 

2415
00:58:33,340 --> 00:58:38,340
the popular idea is if an algorithm
exists then somebody will find it and

2416
00:58:38,340 --> 00:58:38,350
exists then somebody will find it and
 

2417
00:58:38,350 --> 00:58:42,090
exists then somebody will find it and
it's just a matter of writing it down

2418
00:58:42,090 --> 00:58:42,100
it's just a matter of writing it down
 

2419
00:58:42,100 --> 00:58:47,400
it's just a matter of writing it down
one point well but many more algorithms

2420
00:58:47,400 --> 00:58:47,410
one point well but many more algorithms
 

2421
00:58:47,410 --> 00:58:51,000
one point well but many more algorithms
exist than anybody can end understand or

2422
00:58:51,000 --> 00:58:51,010
exist than anybody can end understand or
 

2423
00:58:51,010 --> 00:58:53,340
exist than anybody can end understand or
ever make you discover yeah because

2424
00:58:53,340 --> 00:58:53,350
ever make you discover yeah because
 

2425
00:58:53,350 --> 00:58:55,560
ever make you discover yeah because
they're just way beyond human

2426
00:58:55,560 --> 00:58:55,570
they're just way beyond human
 

2427
00:58:55,570 --> 00:58:57,540
they're just way beyond human
comprehension of the total number of

2428
00:58:57,540 --> 00:58:57,550
comprehension of the total number of
 

2429
00:58:57,550 --> 00:59:03,090
comprehension of the total number of
algorithms is more than mind-boggling

2430
00:59:03,090 --> 00:59:03,100
algorithms is more than mind-boggling
 

2431
00:59:03,100 --> 00:59:06,840
algorithms is more than mind-boggling
so so we have situations now where we

2432
00:59:06,840 --> 00:59:06,850
so so we have situations now where we
 

2433
00:59:06,850 --> 00:59:09,210
so so we have situations now where we
know that algorithm exists but we don't

2434
00:59:09,210 --> 00:59:09,220
know that algorithm exists but we don't
 

2435
00:59:09,220 --> 00:59:11,460
know that algorithm exists but we don't
know we don't the foggiest idea what the

2436
00:59:11,460 --> 00:59:11,470
know we don't the foggiest idea what the
 

2437
00:59:11,470 --> 00:59:14,240
know we don't the foggiest idea what the
algorithms are there's there are simple

00:59:14,240 --> 00:59:14,250
algorithms are there's there are simple
 

2439
00:59:14,250 --> 00:59:18,690
algorithms are there's there are simple
examples based on on game playing where

00:59:28,640 --> 00:59:31,570
of hex because for the first player to
win in the game of hex because hex is

00:59:31,570 --> 00:59:31,580
win in the game of hex because hex is
 

2451
00:59:31,580 --> 00:59:33,910

the game of hack there's a game of hex

2456
00:59:37,090 --> 00:59:37,100
the game of hack there's a game of hex
 

2457
00:59:37,100 --> 00:59:39,400
the game of hack there's a game of hex
which is which based on putting pebbles

2458
00:59:39,400 --> 00:59:39,410
which is which based on putting pebbles
 

2459
00:59:39,410 --> 00:59:42,730
which is which based on putting pebbles
onto a hexagonal board and and the white

2460
00:59:42,730 --> 00:59:42,740
onto a hexagonal board and and the white
 

2461
00:59:42,740 --> 00:59:45,280
onto a hexagonal board and and the white
player tries to get a light path from

2462
00:59:45,280 --> 00:59:45,290
player tries to get a light path from
 

2463
00:59:45,290 --> 00:59:46,990
player tries to get a light path from
left to right and the black player tries

2464
00:59:46,990 --> 00:59:47,000
left to right and the black player tries
 

2465
00:59:47,000 --> 00:59:48,750
left to right and the black player tries
to get a black path from bottom to top

2466
00:59:48,750 --> 00:59:48,760
to get a black path from bottom to top
 

2467
00:59:48,760 --> 00:59:51,730
to get a black path from bottom to top
and how does capture occur just so and

2468
00:59:51,730 --> 00:59:51,740
and how does capture occur just so and
 

2469
00:59:51,740 --> 00:59:53,500
and how does capture occur just so and
and and there's no capture you just put

2470
00:59:53,500 --> 00:59:53,510
and and there's no capture you just put
 

2471
00:59:53,510 --> 00:59:56,260
and and there's no capture you just put
levels down what one at a time but

2472
00:59:56,260 --> 00:59:56,270
levels down what one at a time but
 

2473
00:59:56,270 --> 00:59:58,150
levels down what one at a time but
there's no drawers because they after

2474
00:59:58,150 --> 00:59:58,160
there's no drawers because they after
 

2475
00:59:58,160 --> 00:59:59,590
there's no drawers because they after
all the white and black are played

2476
00:59:59,590 --> 00:59:59,600
all the white and black are played
 

2477
00:59:59,600 --> 01:00:01,180
all the white and black are played
there's either going to be a white path

2478
01:00:01,180 --> 01:00:01,190
there's either going to be a white path
 

2479
01:00:01,190 --> 01:00:03,370
there's either going to be a white path

2481
01:00:03,380 --> 01:00:06,220
across from each to west or a black path
from from bottom to top so there's

2482
01:00:06,220 --> 01:00:06,230
from from bottom to top so there's
 

2483
01:00:06,230 --> 01:00:08,440

take turns like like tic-tac-toe and hex

2488
01:00:16,330 --> 01:00:16,340
take turns like like tic-tac-toe and hex
 

2489
01:00:16,340 --> 01:00:19,150
take turns like like tic-tac-toe and hex
or it can be different sizes but we

2490
01:00:19,150 --> 01:00:19,160
or it can be different sizes but we
 

2491
01:00:19,160 --> 01:00:21,790
or it can be different sizes but we
there's no possibility of a draw and

2492
01:00:21,790 --> 01:00:21,800
there's no possibility of a draw and
 

2493
01:00:21,800 --> 01:00:24,940
there's no possibility of a draw and
player to move one at a time and so it's

2494
01:00:24,940 --> 01:00:24,950
player to move one at a time and so it's
 

2495
01:00:24,950 --> 01:00:26,740
player to move one at a time and so it's
got to be either a first player win or a

2496
01:00:26,740 --> 01:00:26,750
got to be either a first player win or a
 

2497
01:00:26,750 --> 01:00:27,630
got to be either a first player win or a
second player win

2498
01:00:27,630 --> 01:00:27,640
second player win
 

2499
01:00:27,640 --> 01:00:30,400
second player win
mathematically you follow out all the

2500
01:00:30,400 --> 01:00:30,410
mathematically you follow out all the
 

2501
01:00:30,410 --> 01:00:33,220
mathematically you follow out all the
trees and and either either there's

2502
01:00:33,220 --> 01:00:33,230
trees and and either either there's
 

2503
01:00:33,230 --> 01:00:34,330
trees and and either either there's
always the win for the percolator

2504
01:00:34,330 --> 01:00:34,340
always the win for the percolator
 

2505
01:00:34,340 --> 01:00:37,360
always the win for the percolator
second player okay and it's finite the

2506
01:00:37,360 --> 01:00:37,370
second player okay and it's finite the
 

2507
01:00:37,370 --> 01:00:39,760
second player okay and it's finite the
game is finite so there's an algorithm

2508
01:00:39,760 --> 01:00:39,770
game is finite so there's an algorithm
 

2509
01:00:39,770 --> 01:00:42,430
game is finite so there's an algorithm
that will decide you can show it has to

2510
01:00:42,430 --> 01:00:42,440
that will decide you can show it has to
 

2511
01:00:42,440 --> 01:00:44,710
that will decide you can show it has to
be one of the other because the second

2512
01:00:44,710 --> 01:00:44,720
be one of the other because the second
 

2513
01:00:44,720 --> 01:00:47,050
be one of the other because the second
player could mimic the first player with

2514
01:00:47,050 --> 01:00:47,060
player could mimic the first player with
 

2515
01:00:47,060 --> 01:00:50,410
player could mimic the first player with
kind of a pairing strategy and so you

2516
01:00:50,410 --> 01:00:50,420
kind of a pairing strategy and so you
 

2517
01:00:50,420 --> 01:00:55,660
kind of a pairing strategy and so you
can show that it has to be what it has

2518
01:00:55,660 --> 01:00:55,670
can show that it has to be what it has
 

2519
01:00:55,670 --> 01:00:57,160
can show that it has to be what it has
to be one or that but we don't know any

2520
01:00:57,160 --> 01:00:57,170
to be one or that but we don't know any
 

2521
01:00:57,170 --> 01:01:01,630
to be one or that but we don't know any
algorithm no way there there a case

planar graphs these are graphs that you

01:01:42,500 --> 01:01:46,720
taking minors means that you can shrink
an edging into a point or you can delete

also hundreds of them that arise in
 

2635
01:03:46,470 --> 01:03:48,650
also hundreds of them that arise in
applications like I have a book over

2636
01:03:48,650 --> 01:03:48,660
applications like I have a book over
 

2637
01:03:48,660 --> 01:03:51,910
applications like I have a book over
here called classes of graphs and then

2638
01:03:51,910 --> 01:03:51,920
here called classes of graphs and then
 

2639
01:03:51,920 --> 01:03:56,260
here called classes of graphs and then
and it it's amazing how many different

2640
01:03:56,260 --> 01:03:56,270
and it it's amazing how many different
 

2641
01:03:56,270 --> 01:03:59,240
and it it's amazing how many different
classes people have looked at so why do

2642
01:03:59,240 --> 01:03:59,250
classes people have looked at so why do
 

2643
01:03:59,250 --> 01:04:01,580
classes people have looked at so why do
you bring up this theorem lower this

2644
01:04:01,580 --> 01:04:01,590
you bring up this theorem lower this
 

2645
01:04:01,590 --> 01:04:04,670
you bring up this theorem lower this
proof so you know there are lots of

2646
01:04:04,670 --> 01:04:04,680
proof so you know there are lots of
 

2647
01:04:04,680 --> 01:04:06,320
proof so you know there are lots of
algorithms that that are known for

2648
01:04:06,320 --> 01:04:06,330
algorithms that that are known for
 

2649
01:04:06,330 --> 01:04:08,690
algorithms that that are known for
special class of graphs for example if I

2650
01:04:08,690 --> 01:04:08,700
special class of graphs for example if I
 

2651
01:04:08,700 --> 01:04:10,550
special class of graphs for example if I
have a certain if I have a chordal graph

2652
01:04:10,550 --> 01:04:10,560
have a certain if I have a chordal graph
 

2653
01:04:10,560 --> 01:04:13,910
have a certain if I have a chordal graph
then I can color it efficiently if I

2654
01:04:13,910 --> 01:04:13,920
then I can color it efficiently if I
 

2655
01:04:13,920 --> 01:04:16,190
then I can color it efficiently if I
have some kinds of graphs it'll make a

2656
01:04:16,190 --> 01:04:16,200
have some kinds of graphs it'll make a
 

2657
01:04:16,200 --> 01:04:19,490
have some kinds of graphs it'll make a
great Network very soon like you'd like

2658
01:04:19,490 --> 01:04:19,500
great Network very soon like you'd like
 

2659
01:04:19,500 --> 01:04:22,520
great Network very soon like you'd like
to test you somebody gives you a graph

2660
01:04:22,520 --> 01:04:22,530
to test you somebody gives you a graph
 

2661
01:04:22,530 --> 01:04:24,110
to test you somebody gives you a graph
that's always it in this family of grass

2662
01:04:24,110 --> 01:04:24,120
that's always it in this family of grass
 

2663
01:04:24,120 --> 01:04:27,770
that's always it in this family of grass
if so then I hope then I can I can go to

2664
01:04:27,770 --> 01:04:27,780
if so then I hope then I can I can go to
 

2665
01:04:27,780 --> 01:04:29,870
if so then I hope then I can I can go to
the library and find an algorithm that's

2666
01:04:29,870 --> 01:04:29,880
the library and find an algorithm that's
 

2667
01:04:29,880 --> 01:04:32,170
the library and find an algorithm that's
gonna solve my problem on that graph

2668
01:04:32,170 --> 01:04:32,180
gonna solve my problem on that graph
 

2669
01:04:32,180 --> 01:04:35,900
gonna solve my problem on that graph
okay so we we have we want to have a

2670
01:04:35,900 --> 01:04:35,910
okay so we we have we want to have a
 

2671
01:04:35,910 --> 01:04:41,800
okay so we we have we want to have a
graph that says number than that says

2672
01:04:41,800 --> 01:04:41,810

 

2673
01:04:41,810 --> 01:04:43,790

give me a graph I'll tell you whether

2674
01:04:43,790 --> 01:04:43,800
give me a graph I'll tell you whether
 

2675
01:04:43,800 --> 01:04:46,340
give me a graph I'll tell you whether
it's and whether it's in this family or

2676
01:04:46,340 --> 01:04:46,350
it's and whether it's in this family or
 

2677
01:04:46,350 --> 01:04:51,590
it's and whether it's in this family or
not okay and so all I have to do is test

2678
01:04:51,590 --> 01:04:51,600
not okay and so all I have to do is test
 

2679
01:04:51,600 --> 01:04:54,020
not okay and so all I have to do is test
whether or not that does this given

2680
01:04:54,020 --> 01:04:54,030
whether or not that does this given
 

2681
01:04:54,030 --> 01:04:56,030
whether or not that does this given
graph have a minor that's one of the bad

2682
01:04:56,030 --> 01:04:56,040
graph have a minor that's one of the bad
 

2683
01:04:56,040 --> 01:04:58,880
graph have a minor that's one of the bad
ones a minor is is everything you can

2684
01:04:58,880 --> 01:04:58,890
ones a minor is is everything you can
 

2685
01:04:58,890 --> 01:05:01,630
ones a minor is is everything you can
get by shrinking and removing edges and

2686
01:05:01,630 --> 01:05:01,640
get by shrinking and removing edges and
 

2687
01:05:01,640 --> 01:05:03,920
get by shrinking and removing edges and
given any minor there's a polynomial

2688
01:05:03,920 --> 01:05:03,930
given any minor there's a polynomial
 

2689
01:05:03,930 --> 01:05:06,110
given any minor there's a polynomial
time algorithm saying I can tell whether

2690
01:05:06,110 --> 01:05:06,120
time algorithm saying I can tell whether
 

2691
01:05:06,120 --> 01:05:09,920
time algorithm saying I can tell whether
this is a minor of you and there's a

2692
01:05:09,920 --> 01:05:09,930
this is a minor of you and there's a
 

2693
01:05:09,930 --> 01:05:12,110
this is a minor of you and there's a
finite number of bad cases so I just

2694
01:05:12,110 --> 01:05:12,120
finite number of bad cases so I just
 

2695
01:05:12,120 --> 01:05:13,760
finite number of bad cases so I just
tried you know does it have this bad

2696
01:05:13,760 --> 01:05:13,770
tried you know does it have this bad
 

2697
01:05:13,770 --> 01:05:16,580
tried you know does it have this bad
case by polynomial time I got the answer

2698
01:05:16,580 --> 01:05:16,590
case by polynomial time I got the answer
 

2699
01:05:16,590 --> 01:05:18,740
case by polynomial time I got the answer
does he have this bad case probably time

2700
01:05:18,740 --> 01:05:18,750
does he have this bad case probably time
 

2701
01:05:18,750 --> 01:05:22,310
does he have this bad case probably time
I got the answer a total polynomial time

2702
01:05:22,310 --> 01:05:22,320
I got the answer a total polynomial time
 

2703
01:05:22,320 --> 01:05:25,120
I got the answer a total polynomial time
and so I've solved the problem however

2704
01:05:25,120 --> 01:05:25,130
and so I've solved the problem however
 

2705
01:05:25,130 --> 01:05:27,710
and so I've solved the problem however
all we know is that the number of minors

2706
01:05:27,710 --> 01:05:27,720
all we know is that the number of minors
 

2707
01:05:27,720 --> 01:05:31,250
all we know is that the number of minors
is finite we don't know what we might

2708
01:05:31,250 --> 01:05:31,260
is finite we don't know what we might
 

2709
01:05:31,260 --> 01:05:32,720
is finite we don't know what we might
only know one or two of those minors but

2710
01:05:32,720 --> 01:05:32,730
only know one or two of those minors but
 

2711
01:05:32,730 --> 01:05:34,910
only know one or two of those minors but
we don't know that if we got it if we

2712
01:05:34,910 --> 01:05:34,920
we don't know that if we got it if we
 

2713
01:05:34,920 --> 01:05:36,170
we don't know that if we got it if we
got 20 of them we don't know there might

2714
01:05:36,170 --> 01:05:36,180
got 20 of them we don't know there might
 

2715
01:05:36,180 --> 01:05:40,100
got 20 of them we don't know there might
be 20 125 the Halloween all we know is

2716
01:05:40,100 --> 01:05:40,110
be 20 125 the Halloween all we know is
 

2717
01:05:40,110 --> 01:05:43,280
be 20 125 the Halloween all we know is
that is that it's finite so here we have

2718
01:05:43,280 --> 01:05:43,290
that is that it's finite so here we have
 

2719
01:05:43,290 --> 01:05:44,930
that is that it's finite so here we have
a polynomial time algorithm that we

2720
01:05:44,930 --> 01:05:44,940
a polynomial time algorithm that we
 

2721
01:05:44,940 --> 01:05:45,590
a polynomial time algorithm that we
don't know

2722
01:05:45,590 --> 01:05:45,600
don't know

mm-hm that's a really great example of

2724
01:05:47,960 --> 01:05:47,970
mm-hm that's a really great example of
 

2725
01:05:47,970 --> 01:05:50,810
mm-hm that's a really great example of
what you worry about or why you think P

01:05:50,810 --> 01:05:50,820
what you worry about or why you think P
 

2727
01:05:50,820 --> 01:05:52,910
what you worry about or why you think P
equals NP won't be useful

equals NP won't be useful
 

2729
01:05:52,920 --> 01:05:56,600
equals NP won't be useful
but still why do you hold the intuition

2730
01:05:56,600 --> 01:05:56,610
but still why do you hold the intuition
 

2731
01:05:56,610 --> 01:06:02,090
but still why do you hold the intuition
that P equals NP because you have to

2732
01:06:02,090 --> 01:06:02,100
that P equals NP because you have to
 

2733
01:06:02,100 --> 01:06:05,750
that P equals NP because you have to
rule out so many possible algorithms

you can take the graph and you can

2738
01:06:13,400 --> 01:06:13,410
you can take the graph and you can
 

2739
01:06:13,410 --> 01:06:17,510
you can take the graph and you can
represent it as in terms of certain

represent it as in terms of certain
 

2741
01:06:17,520 --> 01:06:19,040
represent it as in terms of certain
prime numbers and then you can multiply

01:06:19,040 --> 01:06:19,050
prime numbers and then you can multiply
 

2743
01:06:19,050 --> 01:06:21,860

2745
01:06:21,870 --> 01:06:25,280
those together and then you can then you
can take the bitwise and and and you

01:06:25,280 --> 01:06:25,290
can take the bitwise and and and you
 

2747
01:06:25,290 --> 01:06:29,000
can take the bitwise and and and you
know and construct some certain constant

know and construct some certain constant
 

2749
01:06:29,010 --> 01:06:31,640
know and construct some certain constant
in polynomial time and then that's you

2750
01:06:31,640 --> 01:06:31,650
in polynomial time and then that's you
 

2751
01:06:31,650 --> 01:06:33,380
in polynomial time and then that's you
know perfectly valid algorithm and that

there's so many algorithms of that kind
a lot of times we see random you take

there's so many hairs on your head

2770
01:07:05,710 --> 01:07:05,720
there's so many hairs on your head
 

2771
01:07:05,720 --> 01:07:10,490
there's so many hairs on your head
but it seems like unlikely that two

2772
01:07:10,490 --> 01:07:10,500
but it seems like unlikely that two
 

2773
01:07:10,500 --> 01:07:11,780
but it seems like unlikely that two
people are going to have the same number

2774
01:07:11,780 --> 01:07:11,790
people are going to have the same number
 

2775
01:07:11,790 --> 01:07:16,310
people are going to have the same number
of hairs on their head but but they're

2776
01:07:16,310 --> 01:07:16,320
of hairs on their head but but they're
 

2777
01:07:16,320 --> 01:07:17,630
of hairs on their head but but they're
obvious but you can count how many

2778
01:07:17,630 --> 01:07:17,640
obvious but you can count how many
 

2779
01:07:17,640 --> 01:07:19,850
obvious but you can count how many
people there are and how many hairs on

2780
01:07:19,850 --> 01:07:19,860
people there are and how many hairs on
 

2781
01:07:19,860 --> 01:07:21,530
people there are and how many hairs on
there so there must be people walking

2782
01:07:21,530 --> 01:07:21,540
there so there must be people walking
 

2783
01:07:21,540 --> 01:07:23,240
there so there must be people walking
around in the country to have the same

2784
01:07:23,240 --> 01:07:23,250
around in the country to have the same
 

2785
01:07:23,250 --> 01:07:24,830
around in the country to have the same
number of hairs on their head well

2786
01:07:24,830 --> 01:07:24,840
number of hairs on their head well
 

2787
01:07:24,840 --> 01:07:26,660
number of hairs on their head well
that's the kind of a coincidence that

2788
01:07:26,660 --> 01:07:26,670
that's the kind of a coincidence that
 

2789
01:07:26,670 --> 01:07:29,180
that's the kind of a coincidence that
you might say also you know this this

2790
01:07:29,180 --> 01:07:29,190
you might say also you know this this
 

2791
01:07:29,190 --> 01:07:31,090
you might say also you know this this
particular combination of operations

2792
01:07:31,090 --> 01:07:31,100
particular combination of operations
 

2793
01:07:31,100 --> 01:07:34,100
particular combination of operations
just happens to prove that a graph is

2794
01:07:34,100 --> 01:07:34,110
just happens to prove that a graph is
 

2795
01:07:34,110 --> 01:07:37,940
just happens to prove that a graph is
has a Hamiltonian path and I see lots of

2796
01:07:37,940 --> 01:07:37,950
has a Hamiltonian path and I see lots of
 

2797
01:07:37,950 --> 01:07:41,390
has a Hamiltonian path and I see lots of
cases where unexpected things happen

2798
01:07:41,390 --> 01:07:41,400
cases where unexpected things happen
 

2799
01:07:41,400 --> 01:07:42,410
cases where unexpected things happen
when you have enough enough

2800
01:07:42,410 --> 01:07:42,420
when you have enough enough
 

2801
01:07:42,420 --> 01:07:45,260
when you have enough enough
possibilities but because the space of

2802
01:07:45,260 --> 01:07:45,270
possibilities but because the space of
 

2803
01:07:45,270 --> 01:07:48,530
possibilities but because the space of
possibility is so huge I have to rule

2804
01:07:48,530 --> 01:07:48,540
possibility is so huge I have to rule
 

2805
01:07:48,540 --> 01:07:50,750
possibility is so huge I have to rule
them all out and so that's the reason

2806
01:07:50,750 --> 01:07:50,760
them all out and so that's the reason
 

2807
01:07:50,760 --> 01:07:52,790
them all out and so that's the reason
for my intuition is good by no means

2808
01:07:52,790 --> 01:07:52,800
for my intuition is good by no means
 

2809
01:07:52,800 --> 01:07:56,090
for my intuition is good by no means
approve I mean some people say you know

2810
01:07:56,090 --> 01:07:56,100
approve I mean some people say you know
 

2811
01:07:56,100 --> 01:07:59,120
approve I mean some people say you know
well P can't equal NP because you've had

2812
01:07:59,120 --> 01:07:59,130
well P can't equal NP because you've had
 

2813
01:07:59,130 --> 01:08:03,050
well P can't equal NP because you've had
all these smart people you know the

2814
01:08:03,050 --> 01:08:03,060
all these smart people you know the
 

2815
01:08:03,060 --> 01:08:05,120
all these smart people you know the
smartest designers of algorithms that

2816
01:08:05,120 --> 01:08:05,130
smartest designers of algorithms that
 

2817
01:08:05,130 --> 01:08:06,120
smartest designers of algorithms that
have been

2818
01:08:06,120 --> 01:08:06,130
have been
 

2819
01:08:06,130 --> 01:08:07,920
have been
wrecking their brains for years and

2820
01:08:07,920 --> 01:08:07,930
wrecking their brains for years and
 

2821
01:08:07,930 --> 01:08:10,109
wrecking their brains for years and
years and and there's million-dollar

2822
01:08:10,109 --> 01:08:10,119
years and and there's million-dollar
 

2823
01:08:10,119 --> 01:08:11,609
years and and there's million-dollar
prizes out there and you know none of

2824
01:08:11,609 --> 01:08:11,619
prizes out there and you know none of
 

2825
01:08:11,619 --> 01:08:16,200
prizes out there and you know none of
them nobody has thought of the algorithm

2826
01:08:16,200 --> 01:08:16,210
them nobody has thought of the algorithm
 

2827
01:08:16,210 --> 01:08:19,470
them nobody has thought of the algorithm
so it must must be no such job on the

2828
01:08:19,470 --> 01:08:19,480
so it must must be no such job on the
 

2829
01:08:19,480 --> 01:08:22,410
so it must must be no such job on the
other hand I can use exactly the same

2830
01:08:22,410 --> 01:08:22,420
other hand I can use exactly the same
 

2831
01:08:22,420 --> 01:08:25,410
other hand I can use exactly the same
logic and I can say well P must be equal

2832
01:08:25,410 --> 01:08:25,420
logic and I can say well P must be equal
 

2833
01:08:25,420 --> 01:08:27,149
logic and I can say well P must be equal
to NP because there's so many smart

2834
01:08:27,149 --> 01:08:27,159
to NP because there's so many smart
 

2835
01:08:27,159 --> 01:08:28,680
to NP because there's so many smart
people out here been trying to prove it

2836
01:08:28,680 --> 01:08:28,690
people out here been trying to prove it
 

2837
01:08:28,690 --> 01:08:32,789
people out here been trying to prove it
unequal to NP and they've all failed you

2838
01:08:32,789 --> 01:08:32,799
unequal to NP and they've all failed you
 

2839
01:08:32,799 --> 01:08:36,059
unequal to NP and they've all failed you
know this kind of reminds me of the

2840
01:08:36,059 --> 01:08:36,069
know this kind of reminds me of the
 

2841
01:08:36,069 --> 01:08:38,300
know this kind of reminds me of the
discussion about the search for aliens

2842
01:08:38,300 --> 01:08:38,310
discussion about the search for aliens
 

2843
01:08:38,310 --> 01:08:40,649
discussion about the search for aliens
they've been trying to look for them and

2844
01:08:40,649 --> 01:08:40,659
they've been trying to look for them and
 

2845
01:08:40,659 --> 01:08:42,089
they've been trying to look for them and
we haven't found them yet therefore they

2846
01:08:42,089 --> 01:08:42,099
we haven't found them yet therefore they
 

2847
01:08:42,099 --> 01:08:42,839
we haven't found them yet therefore they
don't exist

2848
01:08:42,839 --> 01:08:42,849
don't exist
 

2849
01:08:42,849 --> 01:08:45,209
don't exist
yeah but you can show that there's so

2850
01:08:45,209 --> 01:08:45,219
yeah but you can show that there's so
 

2851
01:08:45,219 --> 01:08:46,800
yeah but you can show that there's so
many planets out there that they very

2852
01:08:46,800 --> 01:08:46,810
many planets out there that they very
 

2853
01:08:46,810 --> 01:08:50,370
many planets out there that they very
possibly could exist yeah and right and

2854
01:08:50,370 --> 01:08:50,380
possibly could exist yeah and right and
 

2855
01:08:50,380 --> 01:08:52,370
possibly could exist yeah and right and
then there's also the possibility that

2856
01:08:52,370 --> 01:08:52,380
then there's also the possibility that
 

2857
01:08:52,380 --> 01:08:55,829
then there's also the possibility that
that they exist but they they all

2858
01:08:55,829 --> 01:08:55,839
that they exist but they they all
 

2859
01:08:55,839 --> 01:08:57,629
that they exist but they they all
discovered machine learning or something

2860
01:08:57,629 --> 01:08:57,639
discovered machine learning or something
 

2861
01:08:57,639 --> 01:09:01,019
discovered machine learning or something
and and and then blew each other up well

2862
01:09:01,019 --> 01:09:01,029
and and and then blew each other up well
 

2863
01:09:01,029 --> 01:09:02,999
and and and then blew each other up well
on that small quick danger

2864
01:09:02,999 --> 01:09:03,009
on that small quick danger
 

2865
01:09:03,009 --> 01:09:04,229
on that small quick danger
let me ask do you think there's

2866
01:09:04,229 --> 01:09:04,239
let me ask do you think there's
 

2867
01:09:04,239 --> 01:09:05,669
let me ask do you think there's
intelligent life out there in the

2868
01:09:05,669 --> 01:09:05,679
intelligent life out there in the
 

2869
01:09:05,679 --> 01:09:08,999
intelligent life out there in the
universe I have no idea do you hope so

2870
01:09:08,999 --> 01:09:09,009
universe I have no idea do you hope so
 

2871
01:09:09,009 --> 01:09:12,450
universe I have no idea do you hope so
do you think about it it I I don't I

2872
01:09:12,450 --> 01:09:12,460
do you think about it it I I don't I
 

2873
01:09:12,460 --> 01:09:14,249
do you think about it it I I don't I
don't spend my time thinking about

2874
01:09:14,249 --> 01:09:14,259
don't spend my time thinking about
 

2875
01:09:14,259 --> 01:09:16,079
don't spend my time thinking about
things that I could never know really

2876
01:09:16,079 --> 01:09:16,089
things that I could never know really
 

2877
01:09:16,089 --> 01:09:18,479
things that I could never know really
and yet you do enjoy the fact that there

2878
01:09:18,479 --> 01:09:18,489
and yet you do enjoy the fact that there
 

2879
01:09:18,489 --> 01:09:20,579
and yet you do enjoy the fact that there
are many things you don't know you do

2880
01:09:20,579 --> 01:09:20,589
are many things you don't know you do
 

2881
01:09:20,589 --> 01:09:24,870
are many things you don't know you do
enjoy the mystery of things I enjoy the

2882
01:09:24,870 --> 01:09:24,880
enjoy the mystery of things I enjoy the
 

2883
01:09:24,880 --> 01:09:26,970
enjoy the mystery of things I enjoy the
fact that there that I have limits yeah

2884
01:09:26,970 --> 01:09:26,980
fact that there that I have limits yeah
 

2885
01:09:26,980 --> 01:09:31,399
fact that there that I have limits yeah
but I don't but but I don't take time to

2886
01:09:31,399 --> 01:09:31,409
but I don't but but I don't take time to
 

2887
01:09:31,409 --> 01:09:35,059
but I don't but but I don't take time to
answer unsolvable questions I got it

2888
01:09:35,059 --> 01:09:35,069
answer unsolvable questions I got it
 

2889
01:09:35,069 --> 01:09:38,249
answer unsolvable questions I got it
well because you've taken on some tough

2890
01:09:38,249 --> 01:09:38,259
well because you've taken on some tough
 

2891
01:09:38,259 --> 01:09:40,589
well because you've taken on some tough
questions that may seem unsolvable you

2892
01:09:40,589 --> 01:09:40,599
questions that may seem unsolvable you
 

2893
01:09:40,599 --> 01:09:42,660
questions that may seem unsolvable you
have taken on some tough questions and

2894
01:09:42,660 --> 01:09:42,670
have taken on some tough questions and
 

2895
01:09:42,670 --> 01:09:44,939
have taken on some tough questions and
you seem unsolvable if there is because

2896
01:09:44,939 --> 01:09:44,949
you seem unsolvable if there is because
 

2897
01:09:44,949 --> 01:09:46,530
you seem unsolvable if there is because
we are thrilled when I can get further

2898
01:09:46,530 --> 01:09:46,540
we are thrilled when I can get further
 

2899
01:09:46,540 --> 01:09:48,390
we are thrilled when I can get further
than I ever thought I could right yeah

2900
01:09:48,390 --> 01:09:48,400
than I ever thought I could right yeah
 

2901
01:09:48,400 --> 01:09:51,510
than I ever thought I could right yeah
but but I don't what much like was

2902
01:09:51,510 --> 01:09:51,520
but but I don't what much like was
 

2903
01:09:51,520 --> 01:09:54,540
but but I don't what much like was
religion these I'm glad the dirt that

2904
01:09:54,540 --> 01:09:54,550
religion these I'm glad the dirt that
 

2905
01:09:54,550 --> 01:09:57,030
religion these I'm glad the dirt that
that there are no proof that God exists

2906
01:09:57,030 --> 01:09:57,040
that there are no proof that God exists
 

2907
01:09:57,040 --> 01:09:59,879
that there are no proof that God exists
or not I mean I think it would spoil the

2908
01:09:59,879 --> 01:09:59,889
or not I mean I think it would spoil the
 

2909
01:09:59,889 --> 01:10:05,180
or not I mean I think it would spoil the
mystery it it would be too dull yeah so

2910
01:10:05,180 --> 01:10:05,190
mystery it it would be too dull yeah so

way through it was the people who were
 

2931
01:10:29,680 --> 01:10:35,070
way through it was the people who were

2932
01:10:35,070 --> 01:10:35,080
inspired by trying to mimic intelligence
 

2933
01:10:35,080 --> 01:10:37,620
inspired by trying to mimic intelligence
or to do things that that were somehow

to people who have pushed the envelope
 

2941
01:10:43,810 --> 01:10:48,270
to people who have pushed the envelope
of computer science maybe more than any

01:10:48,270 --> 01:10:48,280
of computer science maybe more than any
 

2943
01:10:48,280 --> 01:10:51,210
of computer science maybe more than any
other group of people so it's all the

2944
01:10:51,210 --> 01:10:51,220
other group of people so it's all the
 

2945
01:10:51,220 --> 01:10:53,100
other group of people so it's all the
way through it's been a great source of

2946
01:10:53,100 --> 01:10:53,110
way through it's been a great source of
 

2947
01:10:53,110 --> 01:10:59,250
way through it's been a great source of
of good problems to to sink teeth into

2948
01:10:59,250 --> 01:10:59,260
of good problems to to sink teeth into
 

2949
01:10:59,260 --> 01:11:06,360
of good problems to to sink teeth into
and and getting getting partial answers

2950
01:11:06,360 --> 01:11:06,370
and and getting getting partial answers
 

2951
01:11:06,370 --> 01:11:08,760
and and getting getting partial answers
and then more and more successful

2952
01:11:08,760 --> 01:11:08,770
and then more and more successful
 

2953
01:11:08,770 --> 01:11:12,630
and then more and more successful
answers over the year so this has this

2954
01:11:12,630 --> 01:11:12,640
answers over the year so this has this
 

2955
01:11:12,640 --> 01:11:14,400
answers over the year so this has this
has been the inspiration for lots of the

2956
01:11:14,400 --> 01:11:14,410
has been the inspiration for lots of the
 

2957
01:11:14,410 --> 01:11:16,140
has been the inspiration for lots of the
great discoveries of computer science

2958
01:11:16,140 --> 01:11:16,150
great discoveries of computer science
 

2959
01:11:16,150 --> 01:11:18,030
great discoveries of computer science
are you yourself captivated by the

2960
01:11:18,030 --> 01:11:18,040
are you yourself captivated by the
 

2961
01:11:18,040 --> 01:11:20,910
are you yourself captivated by the
possibility of creating of algorithms

2962
01:11:20,910 --> 01:11:20,920
possibility of creating of algorithms
 

2963
01:11:20,920 --> 01:11:26,060
possibility of creating of algorithms
having echoes of intelligence in them

2964
01:11:26,060 --> 01:11:26,070
having echoes of intelligence in them
 

2965
01:11:26,070 --> 01:11:29,220
having echoes of intelligence in them
not as much as most of the people in the

2966
01:11:29,220 --> 01:11:29,230
not as much as most of the people in the
 

2967
01:11:29,230 --> 01:11:32,220
not as much as most of the people in the
field I guess I would say but but that's

2968
01:11:32,220 --> 01:11:32,230
field I guess I would say but but that's
 

2969
01:11:32,230 --> 01:11:34,380
field I guess I would say but but that's
not to say that they're wrong or that

2970
01:11:34,380 --> 01:11:34,390
not to say that they're wrong or that
 

2971
01:11:34,390 --> 01:11:36,510
not to say that they're wrong or that
it's just you asked about my own

2972
01:11:36,510 --> 01:11:36,520
it's just you asked about my own
 

2973
01:11:36,520 --> 01:11:39,930
it's just you asked about my own
personal preferences and yeah but but

2974
01:11:39,930 --> 01:11:39,940
personal preferences and yeah but but
 

2975
01:11:39,940 --> 01:11:47,520
personal preferences and yeah but but
the thing that I that I worry about is

2976
01:11:47,520 --> 01:11:47,530
the thing that I that I worry about is
 

2977
01:11:47,530 --> 01:11:49,260
the thing that I that I worry about is
when people start believing that they've

2978
01:11:49,260 --> 01:11:49,270
when people start believing that they've
 

2979
01:11:49,270 --> 01:11:56,220
when people start believing that they've
actually succeeded and because the seems

2980
01:11:56,220 --> 01:11:56,230
actually succeeded and because the seems
 

2981
01:11:56,230 --> 01:11:59,900
actually succeeded and because the seems
to me this huge gap between really

2982
01:11:59,900 --> 01:11:59,910
to me this huge gap between really
 

2983
01:11:59,910 --> 01:12:02,520
to me this huge gap between really
understanding something and being able

2984
01:12:02,520 --> 01:12:02,530
understanding something and being able
 

2985
01:12:02,530 --> 01:12:05,490
understanding something and being able
to pretend to understand something and

2986
01:12:05,490 --> 01:12:05,500
to pretend to understand something and
 

2987
01:12:05,500 --> 01:12:06,900
to pretend to understand something and
give these give the illusion of

2988
01:12:06,900 --> 01:12:06,910
give these give the illusion of
 

2989
01:12:06,910 --> 01:12:08,520
give these give the illusion of
understanding something do you think

2990
01:12:08,520 --> 01:12:08,530
understanding something do you think
 

2991
01:12:08,530 --> 01:12:10,260
understanding something do you think
it's possible to create without

2992
01:12:10,260 --> 01:12:10,270
it's possible to create without
 

2993
01:12:10,270 --> 01:12:12,390
it's possible to create without
understanding yeah

2994
01:12:12,390 --> 01:12:12,400
understanding yeah
 

2995
01:12:12,400 --> 01:12:15,750
understanding yeah
so to uh I do that all the time to run I

2996
01:12:15,750 --> 01:12:15,760
so to uh I do that all the time to run I
 

2997
01:12:15,760 --> 01:12:18,810
so to uh I do that all the time to run I
mean that's why I use random members I

2998
01:12:18,810 --> 01:12:18,820
mean that's why I use random members I
 

2999
01:12:18,820 --> 01:12:23,370
mean that's why I use random members I
like yeah but I but but there's there's

3000
01:12:23,370 --> 01:12:23,380
like yeah but I but but there's there's
 

3001
01:12:23,380 --> 01:12:25,710
like yeah but I but but there's there's
still what this great gap I don't know

3002
01:12:25,710 --> 01:12:25,720
still what this great gap I don't know
 

3003
01:12:25,720 --> 01:12:27,750
still what this great gap I don't know
certain it's impossible but I'm like but

3004
01:12:27,750 --> 01:12:27,760
certain it's impossible but I'm like but
 

3005
01:12:27,760 --> 01:12:31,680
certain it's impossible but I'm like but
I don't see a anything coming any closer

3006
01:12:31,680 --> 01:12:31,690
I don't see a anything coming any closer
 

3007
01:12:31,690 --> 01:12:33,630
I don't see a anything coming any closer
to really

3008
01:12:33,630 --> 01:12:33,640
to really
 

3009
01:12:33,640 --> 01:12:36,780
to really
the the kind of stuff that I would

3010
01:12:36,780 --> 01:12:36,790
the the kind of stuff that I would
 

3011
01:12:36,790 --> 01:12:39,240
the the kind of stuff that I would
consider intelligence say you've

3012
01:12:39,240 --> 01:12:39,250
consider intelligence say you've
 

3013
01:12:39,250 --> 01:12:41,610
consider intelligence say you've
mentioned something that on that line of

3014
01:12:41,610 --> 01:12:41,620
mentioned something that on that line of
 

3015
01:12:41,620 --> 01:12:45,630
mentioned something that on that line of
thinking which I very much agree with so

3016
01:12:45,630 --> 01:12:45,640
thinking which I very much agree with so
 

3017
01:12:45,640 --> 01:12:48,750
thinking which I very much agree with so
the art of computer programming as the

3018
01:12:48,750 --> 01:12:48,760
the art of computer programming as the
 

3019
01:12:48,760 --> 01:12:51,540
the art of computer programming as the
book is focused on single processor

3020
01:12:51,540 --> 01:12:51,550
book is focused on single processor
 

3021
01:12:51,550 --> 01:12:56,400
book is focused on single processor
algorithms and for the most part and you

3022
01:12:56,400 --> 01:12:56,410
algorithms and for the most part and you
 

3023
01:12:56,410 --> 01:12:59,220
algorithms and for the most part and you
mentioned that's only because I set the

3024
01:12:59,220 --> 01:12:59,230
mentioned that's only because I set the
 

3025
01:12:59,230 --> 01:13:01,260
mentioned that's only because I set the
table of contents in 1962 you have to

3026
01:13:01,260 --> 01:13:01,270
table of contents in 1962 you have to
 

3027
01:13:01,270 --> 01:13:05,010
table of contents in 1962 you have to
remember for sure there's no I'm glad I

3028
01:13:05,010 --> 01:13:05,020
remember for sure there's no I'm glad I
 

3029
01:13:05,020 --> 01:13:11,400
remember for sure there's no I'm glad I
didn't wait until 1965 or one book maybe

3030
01:13:11,400 --> 01:13:11,410
didn't wait until 1965 or one book maybe
 

3031
01:13:11,410 --> 01:13:13,920
didn't wait until 1965 or one book maybe
will touch in the Bible but one book

3032
01:13:13,920 --> 01:13:13,930
will touch in the Bible but one book
 

3033
01:13:13,930 --> 01:13:15,930
will touch in the Bible but one book
can't always cover the entirety of

3034
01:13:15,930 --> 01:13:15,940
can't always cover the entirety of
 

3035
01:13:15,940 --> 01:13:20,880
can't always cover the entirety of
everything so I'm glad yeah I'm glad the

3036
01:13:20,880 --> 01:13:20,890
everything so I'm glad yeah I'm glad the
 

3037
01:13:20,890 --> 01:13:24,209
everything so I'm glad yeah I'm glad the
the table of contents for the art of

3038
01:13:24,209 --> 01:13:24,219
the table of contents for the art of
 

3039
01:13:24,219 --> 01:13:26,189
the table of contents for the art of
computer programming is what it is but

3040
01:13:26,189 --> 01:13:26,199
computer programming is what it is but
 

3041
01:13:26,199 --> 01:13:29,430
computer programming is what it is but
you did mention that that you thought

3042
01:13:29,430 --> 01:13:29,440
you did mention that that you thought
 

3043
01:13:29,440 --> 01:13:30,959
you did mention that that you thought
that an understanding of the way ant

3044
01:13:30,959 --> 01:13:30,969
that an understanding of the way ant
 

3045
01:13:30,969 --> 01:13:33,840
that an understanding of the way ant
colonies are able to perform incredibly

3046
01:13:33,840 --> 01:13:33,850
colonies are able to perform incredibly
 

3047
01:13:33,850 --> 01:13:36,240
colonies are able to perform incredibly
organized tasks might well be the key to

3048
01:13:36,240 --> 01:13:36,250
organized tasks might well be the key to
 

3049
01:13:36,250 --> 01:13:38,400
organized tasks might well be the key to
understanding human cognition

3050
01:13:38,400 --> 01:13:38,410
understanding human cognition
 

3051
01:13:38,410 --> 01:13:40,920
understanding human cognition
so these fundamentally distributed

3052
01:13:40,920 --> 01:13:40,930
so these fundamentally distributed
 

3053
01:13:40,930 --> 01:13:43,140
so these fundamentally distributed
systems so what do you think is the

3054
01:13:43,140 --> 01:13:43,150
systems so what do you think is the
 

3055
01:13:43,150 --> 01:13:46,560
systems so what do you think is the
difference between the way Don Knuth

3056
01:13:46,560 --> 01:13:46,570
difference between the way Don Knuth
 

3057
01:13:46,570 --> 01:13:48,570
difference between the way Don Knuth
would sort a list and an ant colony

3058
01:13:48,570 --> 01:13:48,580
would sort a list and an ant colony
 

3059
01:13:48,580 --> 01:13:51,450
would sort a list and an ant colony
would sort a list or performing

3060
01:13:51,450 --> 01:13:51,460
would sort a list or performing
 

3061
01:13:51,460 --> 01:13:54,660
would sort a list or performing
algorithm sorting a list isn't same as

3062
01:13:54,660 --> 01:13:54,670
algorithm sorting a list isn't same as
 

3063
01:13:54,670 --> 01:13:57,570
algorithm sorting a list isn't same as
cognition though but but I know what

3064
01:13:57,570 --> 01:13:57,580
cognition though but but I know what
 

3065
01:13:57,580 --> 01:14:00,900
cognition though but but I know what
you're getting at is well the advantage

3066
01:14:00,900 --> 01:14:00,910
you're getting at is well the advantage
 

3067
01:14:00,910 --> 01:14:04,050
you're getting at is well the advantage
of ant colony at least we can see what

3068
01:14:04,050 --> 01:14:04,060
of ant colony at least we can see what
 

3069
01:14:04,060 --> 01:14:06,330
of ant colony at least we can see what
they're doing we we know which ant has

3070
01:14:06,330 --> 01:14:06,340
they're doing we we know which ant has
 

3071
01:14:06,340 --> 01:14:08,670
they're doing we we know which ant has
talked to which other ant and and and

3072
01:14:08,670 --> 01:14:08,680
talked to which other ant and and and
 

3073
01:14:08,680 --> 01:14:11,459
talked to which other ant and and and
and it's much harder with the quick

3074
01:14:11,459 --> 01:14:11,469
and it's much harder with the quick
 

3075
01:14:11,469 --> 01:14:14,850
and it's much harder with the quick
brains to just to know how to what

3076
01:14:14,850 --> 01:14:14,860
brains to just to know how to what
 

3077
01:14:14,860 --> 01:14:18,450
brains to just to know how to what
extent of neurons are passing signal so

3078
01:14:18,450 --> 01:14:18,460
extent of neurons are passing signal so
 

3079
01:14:18,460 --> 01:14:21,060
extent of neurons are passing signal so
I understand that aunt Connie might be a

3080
01:14:21,060 --> 01:14:21,070
I understand that aunt Connie might be a
 

3081
01:14:21,070 --> 01:14:24,470
I understand that aunt Connie might be a
if they have the secret of cognition

3082
01:14:24,470 --> 01:14:24,480
if they have the secret of cognition
 

3083
01:14:24,480 --> 01:14:27,680
if they have the secret of cognition
think of an ant colony as a cognitive

3084
01:14:27,680 --> 01:14:27,690
think of an ant colony as a cognitive
 

3085
01:14:27,690 --> 01:14:31,380
think of an ant colony as a cognitive
single being rather than as a colony of

3086
01:14:31,380 --> 01:14:31,390
single being rather than as a colony of
 

3087
01:14:31,390 --> 01:14:32,880
single being rather than as a colony of
lots of different ants I mean just like

3088
01:14:32,880 --> 01:14:32,890
lots of different ants I mean just like
 

3089
01:14:32,890 --> 01:14:37,320
lots of different ants I mean just like
the cells of our brain are and and the

3090
01:14:37,320 --> 01:14:37,330
the cells of our brain are and and the
 

3091
01:14:37,330 --> 01:14:41,390
the cells of our brain are and and the
microbiome and all that is interacting

3092
01:14:41,390 --> 01:14:41,400
microbiome and all that is interacting
 

3093
01:14:41,400 --> 01:14:46,229
microbiome and all that is interacting
entities but but somehow I consider

3094
01:14:46,229 --> 01:14:46,239
entities but but somehow I consider
 

3095
01:14:46,239 --> 01:14:46,979
entities but but somehow I consider
myself to be

01:14:46,979 --> 01:14:46,989
myself to be

01:14:46,989 --> 01:14:50,180
myself to be
single person well you know aunt Connie

3098
01:14:50,180 --> 01:14:50,190
single person well you know aunt Connie
 

3099
01:14:50,190 --> 01:14:54,660
single person well you know aunt Connie
you can say might be cognitive is

3100
01:14:54,660 --> 01:14:54,670
you can say might be cognitive is
 

3101
01:14:54,670 --> 01:14:57,770
you can say might be cognitive is
somehow and it's yeah I mean you know I

3102
01:14:57,770 --> 01:14:57,780
somehow and it's yeah I mean you know I
 

3103
01:14:57,780 --> 01:15:03,200
somehow and it's yeah I mean you know I
okay I like I smash a certain aunt and

3104
01:15:03,200 --> 01:15:03,210
okay I like I smash a certain aunt and
 

3105
01:15:03,210 --> 01:15:06,420
okay I like I smash a certain aunt and
mmm that's stung what was that right you

3106
01:15:06,420 --> 01:15:06,430
mmm that's stung what was that right you
 

3107
01:15:06,430 --> 01:15:08,670
mmm that's stung what was that right you
know but if we're going to crack the the

3108
01:15:08,670 --> 01:15:08,680
know but if we're going to crack the the
 

3109
01:15:08,680 --> 01:15:11,520
know but if we're going to crack the the
the secret of cognition it might be that

3110
01:15:11,520 --> 01:15:11,530
the secret of cognition it might be that
 

3111
01:15:11,530 --> 01:15:16,229
the secret of cognition it might be that
we could do so by but my psyche note how

3112
01:15:16,229 --> 01:15:16,239
we could do so by but my psyche note how
 

3113
01:15:16,239 --> 01:15:18,209
we could do so by but my psyche note how
ants do it because we have a better

3114
01:15:18,209 --> 01:15:18,219
ants do it because we have a better
 

3115
01:15:18,219 --> 01:15:19,950
ants do it because we have a better
chance to measure and they're

3116
01:15:19,950 --> 01:15:19,960
chance to measure and they're
 

3117
01:15:19,960 --> 01:15:21,510
chance to measure and they're
communicating by pheromones and by

3118
01:15:21,510 --> 01:15:21,520
communicating by pheromones and by
 

3119
01:15:21,520 --> 01:15:24,300
communicating by pheromones and by
touching each other and sight but but

3120
01:15:24,300 --> 01:15:24,310
touching each other and sight but but
 

3121
01:15:24,310 --> 01:15:27,780
touching each other and sight but but
not by much more subtle phenomenon Mike

3122
01:15:27,780 --> 01:15:27,790
not by much more subtle phenomenon Mike
 

3123
01:15:27,790 --> 01:15:30,690
not by much more subtle phenomenon Mike
electric currents going through but even

3124
01:15:30,690 --> 01:15:30,700
electric currents going through but even
 

3125
01:15:30,700 --> 01:15:32,160
electric currents going through but even
a simpler version of that what are your

3126
01:15:32,160 --> 01:15:32,170
a simpler version of that what are your
 

3127
01:15:32,170 --> 01:15:34,890
a simpler version of that what are your
thoughts of maybe Conway's Game of Life

3128
01:15:34,890 --> 01:15:34,900
thoughts of maybe Conway's Game of Life
 

3129
01:15:34,900 --> 01:15:39,120
thoughts of maybe Conway's Game of Life
okay so Conway's Game of Life is is able

3130
01:15:39,120 --> 01:15:39,130
okay so Conway's Game of Life is is able
 

3131
01:15:39,130 --> 01:15:43,340
okay so Conway's Game of Life is is able
to simulate any any computable process

3132
01:15:43,340 --> 01:15:43,350
to simulate any any computable process
 

3133
01:15:43,350 --> 01:15:47,010
to simulate any any computable process
and any deterministic process is like

3134
01:15:47,010 --> 01:15:47,020
and any deterministic process is like
 

3135
01:15:47,020 --> 01:15:49,500
and any deterministic process is like
how you went there I mean that's not its

3136
01:15:49,500 --> 01:15:49,510
how you went there I mean that's not its
 

3137
01:15:49,510 --> 01:15:54,860
how you went there I mean that's not its
most powerful thing I would say I mean

3138
01:15:54,860 --> 01:15:54,870
most powerful thing I would say I mean
 

3139
01:15:54,870 --> 01:15:58,020
most powerful thing I would say I mean
you can simulate it but the magic is

3140
01:15:58,020 --> 01:15:58,030
you can simulate it but the magic is
 

3141
01:15:58,030 --> 01:16:00,420
you can simulate it but the magic is
that the individual units are

3142
01:16:00,420 --> 01:16:00,430
that the individual units are
 

3143
01:16:00,430 --> 01:16:03,959
that the individual units are
distributed yes and extremely simple yes

3144
01:16:03,959 --> 01:16:03,969
distributed yes and extremely simple yes
 

3145
01:16:03,969 --> 01:16:06,060
distributed yes and extremely simple yes
we can we understand exactly what the

3146
01:16:06,060 --> 01:16:06,070
we can we understand exactly what the
 

3147
01:16:06,070 --> 01:16:07,800
we can we understand exactly what the
primitives are the permit is the just

3148
01:16:07,800 --> 01:16:07,810
primitives are the permit is the just
 

3149
01:16:07,810 --> 01:16:09,660
primitives are the permit is the just
like with the anthology even simple but

3150
01:16:09,660 --> 01:16:09,670
like with the anthology even simple but
 

3151
01:16:09,670 --> 01:16:12,420
like with the anthology even simple but
if we but still it doesn't say that I

3152
01:16:12,420 --> 01:16:12,430
if we but still it doesn't say that I
 

3153
01:16:12,430 --> 01:16:16,770
if we but still it doesn't say that I
understand I understand life I mean I

3154
01:16:16,770 --> 01:16:16,780
understand I understand life I mean I
 

3155
01:16:16,780 --> 01:16:23,310
understand I understand life I mean I
understand it it gives me an it gives me

3156
01:16:23,310 --> 01:16:23,320
understand it it gives me an it gives me
 

3157
01:16:23,320 --> 01:16:24,720
understand it it gives me an it gives me
a better insight into what does it mean

3158
01:16:24,720 --> 01:16:24,730
a better insight into what does it mean
 

3159
01:16:24,730 --> 01:16:30,120
a better insight into what does it mean
to to have a deterministic universe what

3160
01:16:30,120 --> 01:16:30,130
to to have a deterministic universe what
 

3161
01:16:30,130 --> 01:16:34,350
to to have a deterministic universe what
does it mean to to have free choice for

3162
01:16:34,350 --> 01:16:34,360
does it mean to to have free choice for
 

3163
01:16:34,360 --> 01:16:38,100
does it mean to to have free choice for
example do you think God plays dice yes

3164
01:16:38,100 --> 01:16:38,110
example do you think God plays dice yes
 

3165
01:16:38,110 --> 01:16:40,430
example do you think God plays dice yes
I don't see any reason why God should be

3166
01:16:40,430 --> 01:16:40,440
I don't see any reason why God should be
 

3167
01:16:40,440 --> 01:16:42,979
I don't see any reason why God should be
forbidden from using the most efficient

3168
01:16:42,979 --> 01:16:42,989
forbidden from using the most efficient
 

3169
01:16:42,989 --> 01:16:51,090
forbidden from using the most efficient
ways to to to I mean we we know that

3170
01:16:51,090 --> 01:16:51,100
ways to to to I mean we we know that
 

3171
01:16:51,100 --> 01:16:53,090
ways to to to I mean we we know that
dice are extremely important and

3172
01:16:53,090 --> 01:16:53,100
dice are extremely important and
 

3173
01:16:53,100 --> 01:16:55,170
dice are extremely important and
inefficient algorithms there are things

3174
01:16:55,170 --> 01:16:55,180
inefficient algorithms there are things
 

3175
01:16:55,180 --> 01:16:57,180
inefficient algorithms there are things
like that couldn't be done well without

3176
01:16:57,180 --> 01:16:57,190
like that couldn't be done well without
 

3177
01:16:57,190 --> 01:16:59,250
like that couldn't be done well without
randomness and so I don't see any reason

3178
01:16:59,250 --> 01:16:59,260
randomness and so I don't see any reason
 

3179
01:16:59,260 --> 01:17:00,240
randomness and so I don't see any reason
why

3180
01:17:00,240 --> 01:17:00,250
why
 

3181
01:17:00,250 --> 01:17:03,450
why
my god should be prohibited but when the

3182
01:17:03,450 --> 01:17:03,460
my god should be prohibited but when the
 

3183
01:17:03,460 --> 01:17:05,610
my god should be prohibited but when the
when the algorithm requires it

3184
01:17:05,610 --> 01:17:05,620
when the algorithm requires it
 

3185
01:17:05,620 --> 01:17:09,090
when the algorithm requires it
you don't see why the know the physics

3186
01:17:09,090 --> 01:17:09,100
you don't see why the know the physics
 

3187
01:17:09,100 --> 01:17:11,160
you don't see why the know the physics
should constrain it yeah

3188
01:17:11,160 --> 01:17:11,170
should constrain it yeah
 

3189
01:17:11,170 --> 01:17:13,740
should constrain it yeah
so in 2001 you gave a series of lectures

3190
01:17:13,740 --> 01:17:13,750
so in 2001 you gave a series of lectures
 

3191
01:17:13,750 --> 01:17:17,100
so in 2001 you gave a series of lectures
at MIT about religion and science

3192
01:17:17,100 --> 01:17:17,110
at MIT about religion and science
 

3193
01:17:17,110 --> 01:17:19,980
at MIT about religion and science
well that would 1999 but you published

3194
01:17:19,980 --> 01:17:19,990
well that would 1999 but you published
 

3195
01:17:19,990 --> 01:17:23,960
well that would 1999 but you published
the book came out in Cooper so in 1999

3196
01:17:23,960 --> 01:17:23,970
the book came out in Cooper so in 1999
 

3197
01:17:23,970 --> 01:17:26,520
the book came out in Cooper so in 1999
you spent a little bit of time in Boston

3198
01:17:26,520 --> 01:17:26,530
you spent a little bit of time in Boston
 

3199
01:17:26,530 --> 01:17:31,530
you spent a little bit of time in Boston
enough to give those lectures yeah and I

3200
01:17:31,530 --> 01:17:31,540
enough to give those lectures yeah and I
 

3201
01:17:31,540 --> 01:17:36,030
enough to give those lectures yeah and I
read in the 2001 version that most of it

3202
01:17:36,030 --> 01:17:36,040
read in the 2001 version that most of it
 

3203
01:17:36,040 --> 01:17:37,800
read in the 2001 version that most of it
it's quite fascinating read I recommend

3204
01:17:37,800 --> 01:17:37,810
it's quite fascinating read I recommend
 

3205
01:17:37,810 --> 01:17:39,930
it's quite fascinating read I recommend
people its transcription of your

3206
01:17:39,930 --> 01:17:39,940
people its transcription of your
 

3207
01:17:39,940 --> 01:17:43,290
people its transcription of your
lectures so what did you learn about how

3208
01:17:43,290 --> 01:17:43,300
lectures so what did you learn about how
 

3209
01:17:43,300 --> 01:17:45,450
lectures so what did you learn about how
ideas get started and grow from studying

3210
01:17:45,450 --> 01:17:45,460
ideas get started and grow from studying
 

3211
01:17:45,460 --> 01:17:47,100
ideas get started and grow from studying
the history of the Bible sieve

3212
01:17:47,100 --> 01:17:47,110
the history of the Bible sieve
 

3213
01:17:47,110 --> 01:17:49,860
the history of the Bible sieve
rigorously studied a very particular

3214
01:17:49,860 --> 01:17:49,870
rigorously studied a very particular
 

3215
01:17:49,870 --> 01:17:52,830
rigorously studied a very particular
part of the Bible what did you learn

3216
01:17:52,830 --> 01:17:52,840
part of the Bible what did you learn
 

3217
01:17:52,840 --> 01:17:54,720
part of the Bible what did you learn
from this process about the way us human

3218
01:17:54,720 --> 01:17:54,730
from this process about the way us human
 

3219
01:17:54,730 --> 01:17:57,480
from this process about the way us human
beings as a society develop and grow

3220
01:17:57,480 --> 01:17:57,490
beings as a society develop and grow
 

3221
01:17:57,490 --> 01:18:01,140
beings as a society develop and grow
ideas share ideas and I'm by those idea

3222
01:18:01,140 --> 01:18:01,150
ideas share ideas and I'm by those idea
 

3223
01:18:01,150 --> 01:18:05,880
ideas share ideas and I'm by those idea
I I tried to summarize that I wouldn't

3224
01:18:05,880 --> 01:18:05,890
I I tried to summarize that I wouldn't
 

3225
01:18:05,890 --> 01:18:08,250
I I tried to summarize that I wouldn't
say that I that I learned a great deal

3226
01:18:08,250 --> 01:18:08,260
say that I that I learned a great deal
 

3227
01:18:08,260 --> 01:18:10,710
say that I that I learned a great deal
of really definite things like right

3228
01:18:10,710 --> 01:18:10,720
of really definite things like right
 

3229
01:18:10,720 --> 01:18:12,330
of really definite things like right
where I could make conclusions but I

3230
01:18:12,330 --> 01:18:12,340
where I could make conclusions but I
 

3231
01:18:12,340 --> 01:18:15,540
where I could make conclusions but I
learned more about what I don't know you

3232
01:18:15,540 --> 01:18:15,550
learned more about what I don't know you
 

3233
01:18:15,550 --> 01:18:17,730
learned more about what I don't know you
have a complex subject which is really

3234
01:18:17,730 --> 01:18:17,740
have a complex subject which is really
 

3235
01:18:17,740 --> 01:18:22,830
have a complex subject which is really
beyond human understanding so so we give

3236
01:18:22,830 --> 01:18:22,840
beyond human understanding so so we give
 

3237
01:18:22,840 --> 01:18:24,270
beyond human understanding so so we give
up on saying I'm never going to get to

3238
01:18:24,270 --> 01:18:24,280
up on saying I'm never going to get to
 

3239
01:18:24,280 --> 01:18:25,530
up on saying I'm never going to get to
the end of the road and I'm never going

3240
01:18:25,530 --> 01:18:25,540
the end of the road and I'm never going
 

3241
01:18:25,540 --> 01:18:27,780
the end of the road and I'm never going
to understand it but you say but but

3242
01:18:27,780 --> 01:18:27,790
to understand it but you say but but
 

3243
01:18:27,790 --> 01:18:31,470
to understand it but you say but but
maybe it might be good for me to to get

3244
01:18:31,470 --> 01:18:31,480
maybe it might be good for me to to get
 

3245
01:18:31,480 --> 01:18:33,000
maybe it might be good for me to to get
closer and closer and learn more about

3246
01:18:33,000 --> 01:18:33,010
closer and closer and learn more about
 

3247
01:18:33,010 --> 01:18:35,580
closer and closer and learn more about
more and more about something and so you

3248
01:18:35,580 --> 01:18:35,590
more and more about something and so you
 

3249
01:18:35,590 --> 01:18:38,730
more and more about something and so you
know oh how can I do that efficiently

3250
01:18:38,730 --> 01:18:38,740
know oh how can I do that efficiently
 

3251
01:18:38,740 --> 01:18:43,190
know oh how can I do that efficiently
and the answer is well use randomness

3252
01:18:43,190 --> 01:18:43,200
and the answer is well use randomness
 

3253
01:18:43,200 --> 01:18:49,490
and the answer is well use randomness
and so to try a random subset of the

3254
01:18:49,490 --> 01:18:49,500
and so to try a random subset of the
 

3255
01:18:49,500 --> 01:18:53,790
and so to try a random subset of the
that that is within my grasp and and and

3256
01:18:53,790 --> 01:18:53,800
that that is within my grasp and and and
 

3257
01:18:53,800 --> 01:18:57,770
that that is within my grasp and and and
and study that in detail instead of just

3258
01:18:57,770 --> 01:18:57,780
and study that in detail instead of just
 

3259
01:18:57,780 --> 01:19:00,180
and study that in detail instead of just
studying parts that somebody tells me to

3260
01:19:00,180 --> 01:19:00,190
studying parts that somebody tells me to
 

3261
01:19:00,190 --> 01:19:03,350
studying parts that somebody tells me to
study or instead of studying nothing

3262
01:19:03,350 --> 01:19:03,360
study or instead of studying nothing
 

3263
01:19:03,360 --> 01:19:11,970
study or instead of studying nothing
because it's too hard so I I i decided

3264
01:19:11,970 --> 01:19:11,980

 

3265
01:19:11,980 --> 01:19:14,400

for my own amusement that one ones that

3266
01:19:14,400 --> 01:19:14,410
for my own amusement that one ones that
 

3267
01:19:14,410 --> 01:19:18,180
for my own amusement that one ones that
I would I would take a subset of the of

3268
01:19:18,180 --> 01:19:18,190
I would I would take a subset of the of
 

3269
01:19:18,190 --> 01:19:21,479
I would I would take a subset of the of
the verses of the Bible

3270
01:19:21,479 --> 01:19:21,489
the verses of the Bible
 

3271
01:19:21,489 --> 01:19:25,710
the verses of the Bible
and I would try to find out what the

3272
01:19:25,710 --> 01:19:25,720
and I would try to find out what the
 

3273
01:19:25,720 --> 01:19:28,560
and I would try to find out what the
best thinkers have said about that small

3274
01:19:28,560 --> 01:19:28,570
best thinkers have said about that small
 

3275
01:19:28,570 --> 01:19:32,550
best thinkers have said about that small
subset and I had had about let's say 660

3276
01:19:32,550 --> 01:19:32,560
subset and I had had about let's say 660
 

3277
01:19:32,560 --> 01:19:35,310
subset and I had had about let's say 660
verses out of out of 3,000 I think it's

3278
01:19:35,310 --> 01:19:35,320
verses out of out of 3,000 I think it's
 

3279
01:19:35,320 --> 01:19:36,990
verses out of out of 3,000 I think it's
one out of 500 or something like this

3280
01:19:36,990 --> 01:19:37,000
one out of 500 or something like this
 

3281
01:19:37,000 --> 01:19:39,210
one out of 500 or something like this
and so then I went to the libraries

3282
01:19:39,210 --> 01:19:39,220
and so then I went to the libraries
 

3283
01:19:39,220 --> 01:19:42,270
and so then I went to the libraries
which which are well indexed uh you can

3284
01:19:42,270 --> 01:19:42,280
which which are well indexed uh you can
 

3285
01:19:42,280 --> 01:19:46,890
which which are well indexed uh you can
you you know I spent for example at at

3286
01:19:46,890 --> 01:19:46,900
you you know I spent for example at at
 

3287
01:19:46,900 --> 01:19:49,710
you you know I spent for example at at
Boston Public Library I I would go once

3288
01:19:49,710 --> 01:19:49,720
Boston Public Library I I would go once
 

3289
01:19:49,720 --> 01:19:54,960
Boston Public Library I I would go once
a week for a year and I went to I went I

3290
01:19:54,960 --> 01:19:54,970
a week for a year and I went to I went I
 

3291
01:19:54,970 --> 01:19:57,840
a week for a year and I went to I went I
have done time stuff and over Harvard

3292
01:19:57,840 --> 01:19:57,850
have done time stuff and over Harvard
 

3293
01:19:57,850 --> 01:20:01,229
have done time stuff and over Harvard
library to look at this yes that weren't

3294
01:20:01,229 --> 01:20:01,239
library to look at this yes that weren't
 

3295
01:20:01,239 --> 01:20:04,260
library to look at this yes that weren't
in the Boston Public where they where

3296
01:20:04,260 --> 01:20:04,270
in the Boston Public where they where
 

3297
01:20:04,270 --> 01:20:06,120
in the Boston Public where they where
scholars had looked at and you can call

3298
01:20:06,120 --> 01:20:06,130
scholars had looked at and you can call
 

3299
01:20:06,130 --> 01:20:08,070
scholars had looked at and you can call
in the eight and you can go down the

3300
01:20:08,070 --> 01:20:08,080
in the eight and you can go down the
 

3301
01:20:08,080 --> 01:20:11,100
in the eight and you can go down the
shelves and and you can pretty you can

3302
01:20:11,100 --> 01:20:11,110
shelves and and you can pretty you can
 

3303
01:20:11,110 --> 01:20:12,930
shelves and and you can pretty you can
look at the index and say oh there it is

3304
01:20:12,930 --> 01:20:12,940
look at the index and say oh there it is
 

3305
01:20:12,940 --> 01:20:15,090
look at the index and say oh there it is
this verse I mentioned anywhere in this

3306
01:20:15,090 --> 01:20:15,100
this verse I mentioned anywhere in this
 

3307
01:20:15,100 --> 01:20:18,090
this verse I mentioned anywhere in this
book if so look at page 105 so I was

3308
01:20:18,090 --> 01:20:18,100
book if so look at page 105 so I was
 

3309
01:20:18,100 --> 01:20:20,130
book if so look at page 105 so I was
like I could learn not only about the

3310
01:20:20,130 --> 01:20:20,140
like I could learn not only about the
 

3311
01:20:20,140 --> 01:20:22,290
like I could learn not only about the
Bible but about the secondary literature

3312
01:20:22,290 --> 01:20:22,300
Bible but about the secondary literature
 

3313
01:20:22,300 --> 01:20:24,420
Bible but about the secondary literature
about the Bible the things that scholars

3314
01:20:24,420 --> 01:20:24,430
about the Bible the things that scholars
 

3315
01:20:24,430 --> 01:20:26,880
about the Bible the things that scholars
have written about it and so that that

3316
01:20:26,880 --> 01:20:26,890
have written about it and so that that
 

3317
01:20:26,890 --> 01:20:32,490
have written about it and so that that
gave me a way to uh to zoom in on parts

3318
01:20:32,490 --> 01:20:32,500
gave me a way to uh to zoom in on parts
 

3319
01:20:32,500 --> 01:20:34,140
gave me a way to uh to zoom in on parts
of the things so that I could get more

3320
01:20:34,140 --> 01:20:34,150
of the things so that I could get more
 

3321
01:20:34,150 --> 01:20:37,740
of the things so that I could get more
more insight and and so I look at it as

3322
01:20:37,740 --> 01:20:37,750
more insight and and so I look at it as
 

3323
01:20:37,750 --> 01:20:43,110
more insight and and so I look at it as
a way of giving me some firm pegs which

3324
01:20:43,110 --> 01:20:43,120
a way of giving me some firm pegs which
 

3325
01:20:43,120 --> 01:20:44,940
a way of giving me some firm pegs which
icon which I could hang pieces of

3326
01:20:44,940 --> 01:20:44,950
icon which I could hang pieces of
 

3327
01:20:44,950 --> 01:20:47,970
icon which I could hang pieces of
information but not as as things where I

3328
01:20:47,970 --> 01:20:47,980
information but not as as things where I
 

3329
01:20:47,980 --> 01:20:50,850
information but not as as things where I
would say and therefore this is true in

3330
01:20:50,850 --> 01:20:50,860
would say and therefore this is true in
 

3331
01:20:50,860 --> 01:20:54,090
would say and therefore this is true in
this random approach of sampling the

3332
01:20:54,090 --> 01:20:54,100
this random approach of sampling the
 

3333
01:20:54,100 --> 01:20:58,970
this random approach of sampling the
Bible what did you learn about the the

3334
01:20:58,970 --> 01:20:58,980
Bible what did you learn about the the
 

3335
01:20:58,980 --> 01:21:03,450
Bible what did you learn about the the
most you know central oh one of the

3336
01:21:03,450 --> 01:21:03,460
most you know central oh one of the
 

3337
01:21:03,460 --> 01:21:05,340
most you know central oh one of the
biggest accumulation of ideas you know

3338
01:21:05,340 --> 01:21:05,350
biggest accumulation of ideas you know
 

3339
01:21:05,350 --> 01:21:08,550
biggest accumulation of ideas you know
to me that the that the main thrust was

3340
01:21:08,550 --> 01:21:08,560
to me that the that the main thrust was
 

3341
01:21:08,560 --> 01:21:11,130
to me that the that the main thrust was
not the one that most people think of as

3342
01:21:11,130 --> 01:21:11,140
not the one that most people think of as
 

3343
01:21:11,140 --> 01:21:13,830
not the one that most people think of as
saying you know you know don't have sex

3344
01:21:13,830 --> 01:21:13,840
saying you know you know don't have sex
 

3345
01:21:13,840 --> 01:21:16,920
saying you know you know don't have sex
or something like this but that the main

3346
01:21:16,920 --> 01:21:16,930
or something like this but that the main
 

3347
01:21:16,930 --> 01:21:22,890
or something like this but that the main
thrust was to try to to try to figure

3348
01:21:22,890 --> 01:21:22,900
thrust was to try to to try to figure
 

3349
01:21:22,900 --> 01:21:24,900
thrust was to try to to try to figure
out how to live in harmony

3350
01:21:24,900 --> 01:21:24,910
out how to live in harmony
 

3351
01:21:24,910 --> 01:21:27,570
out how to live in harmony
with God's wishes I'm assuming that God

3352
01:21:27,570 --> 01:21:27,580
with God's wishes I'm assuming that God
 

3353
01:21:27,580 --> 01:21:31,050
with God's wishes I'm assuming that God
exists and I say I'm glad that I that

3354
01:21:31,050 --> 01:21:31,060
exists and I say I'm glad that I that
 

3355
01:21:31,060 --> 01:21:32,760
exists and I say I'm glad that I that
there's no way to prove this because

3356
01:21:32,760 --> 01:21:32,770
there's no way to prove this because
 

3357
01:21:32,770 --> 01:21:36,330
there's no way to prove this because
that would that would I would run

3358
01:21:36,330 --> 01:21:36,340
that would that would I would run
 

3359
01:21:36,340 --> 01:21:37,560
that would that would I would run
through the proof once and then I'd

3360
01:21:37,560 --> 01:21:37,570
through the proof once and then I'd
 

3361
01:21:37,570 --> 01:21:40,620
through the proof once and then I'd
forget it and and it would and and I

3362
01:21:40,620 --> 01:21:40,630
forget it and and it would and and I
 

3363
01:21:40,630 --> 01:21:44,010
forget it and and it would and and I
would never just speculate about

3364
01:21:44,010 --> 01:21:44,020
would never just speculate about
 

3365
01:21:44,020 --> 01:21:48,210
would never just speculate about
spiritual things and mysteries otherwise

3366
01:21:48,210 --> 01:21:48,220
spiritual things and mysteries otherwise
 

3367
01:21:48,220 --> 01:21:50,120
spiritual things and mysteries otherwise
and I think my life would be very

3368
01:21:50,120 --> 01:21:50,130
and I think my life would be very
 

3369
01:21:50,130 --> 01:21:55,380
and I think my life would be very
incomplete so I so I'm assuming that God

3370
01:21:55,380 --> 01:21:55,390
incomplete so I so I'm assuming that God
 

3371
01:21:55,390 --> 01:21:59,940
incomplete so I so I'm assuming that God
exists but it if but a lot of things the

3372
01:21:59,940 --> 01:21:59,950
exists but it if but a lot of things the
 

3373
01:21:59,950 --> 01:22:02,220
exists but it if but a lot of things the
people say God doesn't exist but that's

3374
01:22:02,220 --> 01:22:02,230
people say God doesn't exist but that's
 

3375
01:22:02,230 --> 01:22:04,080
people say God doesn't exist but that's
still important to them and so in a way

3376
01:22:04,080 --> 01:22:04,090
still important to them and so in a way
 

3377
01:22:04,090 --> 01:22:07,410
still important to them and so in a way
in a way that might still be other God

3378
01:22:07,410 --> 01:22:07,420
in a way that might still be other God
 

3379
01:22:07,420 --> 01:22:11,670
in a way that might still be other God
is there or not in some sense so it it

3380
01:22:11,670 --> 01:22:11,680
is there or not in some sense so it it
 

3381
01:22:11,680 --> 01:22:14,370
is there or not in some sense so it it
guys important to them it's one of the

3382
01:22:14,370 --> 01:22:14,380
guys important to them it's one of the
 

3383
01:22:14,380 --> 01:22:17,580
guys important to them it's one of the
one of the verses I studied act is you

3384
01:22:17,580 --> 01:22:17,590
one of the verses I studied act is you
 

3385
01:22:17,590 --> 01:22:19,290
one of the verses I studied act is you
can interpret as saying you know it's

3386
01:22:19,290 --> 01:22:19,300
can interpret as saying you know it's
 

3387
01:22:19,300 --> 01:22:22,650
can interpret as saying you know it's
much better to be an atheist that not to

3388
01:22:22,650 --> 01:22:22,660
much better to be an atheist that not to
 

3389
01:22:22,660 --> 01:22:26,250
much better to be an atheist that not to
care at all so I would say it's yeah

3390
01:22:26,250 --> 01:22:26,260
care at all so I would say it's yeah
 

3391
01:22:26,260 --> 01:22:27,930
care at all so I would say it's yeah
it's similar to the P equals NP

3392
01:22:27,930 --> 01:22:27,940
it's similar to the P equals NP
 

3393
01:22:27,940 --> 01:22:30,360
it's similar to the P equals NP
discussion yeah you you mentioned a

3394
01:22:30,360 --> 01:22:30,370
discussion yeah you you mentioned a
 

3395
01:22:30,370 --> 01:22:33,840
discussion yeah you you mentioned a
mental exercise that I'd love it if you

3396
01:22:33,840 --> 01:22:33,850
mental exercise that I'd love it if you
 

3397
01:22:33,850 --> 01:22:37,110
mental exercise that I'd love it if you
could partake in yourself a mental

3398
01:22:37,110 --> 01:22:37,120
could partake in yourself a mental
 

3399
01:22:37,120 --> 01:22:39,840
could partake in yourself a mental
exercise of being God and so how would

3400
01:22:39,840 --> 01:22:39,850
exercise of being God and so how would
 

3401
01:22:39,850 --> 01:22:42,510
exercise of being God and so how would
you if you were God dot Knuth how would

3402
01:22:42,510 --> 01:22:42,520
you if you were God dot Knuth how would
 

3403
01:22:42,520 --> 01:22:43,950
you if you were God dot Knuth how would
you present yourself to the people of

3404
01:22:43,950 --> 01:22:43,960
you present yourself to the people of
 

3405
01:22:43,960 --> 01:22:47,100
you present yourself to the people of
Earth you mentioned your love of

3406
01:22:47,100 --> 01:22:47,110
Earth you mentioned your love of
 

3407
01:22:47,110 --> 01:22:48,750
Earth you mentioned your love of
literature and there was it there's this

3408
01:22:48,750 --> 01:22:48,760
literature and there was it there's this
 

3409
01:22:48,760 --> 01:22:50,820
literature and there was it there's this
book that would that really uh I can

3410
01:22:50,820 --> 01:22:50,830
book that would that really uh I can
 

3411
01:22:50,830 --> 01:22:53,550
book that would that really uh I can
recommend to you if I can't think yeah

3412
01:22:53,550 --> 01:22:53,560
recommend to you if I can't think yeah
 

3413
01:22:53,560 --> 01:22:56,100
recommend to you if I can't think yeah
the title I think is blasphemy it talks

3414
01:22:56,100 --> 01:22:56,110
the title I think is blasphemy it talks
 

3415
01:22:56,110 --> 01:22:58,920
the title I think is blasphemy it talks
about God revealing himself through a

3416
01:22:58,920 --> 01:22:58,930
about God revealing himself through a
 

3417
01:22:58,930 --> 01:23:06,650
about God revealing himself through a
computer in in in Los Alamos and and it

3418
01:23:06,650 --> 01:23:06,660

 

3419
01:23:06,660 --> 01:23:09,480

it's the only book that I've ever read

3420
01:23:09,480 --> 01:23:09,490
it's the only book that I've ever read
 

3421
01:23:09,490 --> 01:23:13,470
it's the only book that I've ever read
where the punchline was really the very

3422
01:23:13,470 --> 01:23:13,480
where the punchline was really the very
 

3423
01:23:13,480 --> 01:23:16,500
where the punchline was really the very
last word of the book and it explained

3424
01:23:16,500 --> 01:23:16,510
last word of the book and it explained
 

3425
01:23:16,510 --> 01:23:18,870
last word of the book and it explained
the whole idea of the book and so I

3426
01:23:18,870 --> 01:23:18,880
the whole idea of the book and so I
 

3427
01:23:18,880 --> 01:23:21,000
the whole idea of the book and so I
don't want to give that away but it but

3428
01:23:21,000 --> 01:23:21,010
don't want to give that away but it but
 

3429
01:23:21,010 --> 01:23:22,860
don't want to give that away but it but
it's really very much about this

3430
01:23:22,860 --> 01:23:22,870
it's really very much about this
 

3431
01:23:22,870 --> 01:23:26,400
it's really very much about this
question that that she raised

3432
01:23:26,400 --> 01:23:26,410
question that that she raised
 

3433
01:23:26,410 --> 01:23:31,770
question that that she raised
but but suppose God said okay that my

3434
01:23:31,770 --> 01:23:31,780
but but suppose God said okay that my
 

3435
01:23:31,780 --> 01:23:35,230
but but suppose God said okay that my

3440
01:23:40,890 --> 01:23:40,900
21st century so what should I do now and
 

3441
01:23:40,900 --> 01:23:45,610
21st century so what should I do now and
and and it's conceivable that that it

3442
01:23:45,610 --> 01:23:45,620
and and it's conceivable that that it
 

3443
01:23:45,620 --> 01:23:48,940
and and it's conceivable that that it

01:23:48,940 --> 01:23:48,950
would that that God would choose the way
 

3445
01:23:48,950 --> 01:23:50,830
would that that God would choose the way
that's described in this book and

01:23:50,830 --> 01:23:50,840
that's described in this book and
 

3447
01:23:50,840 --> 01:23:52,720
that's described in this book and
another way to look at this exercise is

another way to look at this exercise is
 

3449
01:23:52,730 --> 01:23:55,330
another way to look at this exercise is

realize that once we solve one problem

3458
01:24:03,970 --> 01:24:03,980
realize that once we solve one problem
 

3459
01:24:03,980 --> 01:24:06,520
realize that once we solve one problem
that doesn't mean it worked at all so no

3460
01:24:06,520 --> 01:24:06,530
that doesn't mean it worked at all so no
 

3461
01:24:06,530 --> 01:24:08,800
that doesn't mean it worked at all so no
other problems are going to drop out and

other problems are going to drop out and
 

3463
01:24:08,810 --> 01:24:15,030
other problems are going to drop out and
and and and we have to realize that that

I when I'm down and I you know and I

3564
01:27:17,220 --> 01:27:17,230
I when I'm down and I you know and I
 

3565
01:27:17,230 --> 01:27:19,590
I when I'm down and I you know and I
think I mean I know that I'm chemically

think I mean I know that I'm chemically
 

3567

certain amount of time and and and if
 

3573
01:27:28,810 --> 01:27:30,540
certain amount of time and and and if
that gets out of kilter and I'm more

01:27:30,540 --> 01:27:30,550
that gets out of kilter and I'm more
 

3575
01:27:30,550 --> 01:27:32,280
that gets out of kilter and I'm more
depressed and you know sometimes like

3576
01:27:32,280 --> 01:27:32,290
depressed and you know sometimes like
 

3577
01:27:32,290 --> 01:27:34,980
depressed and you know sometimes like
like I find myself trying to say now who

3578
01:27:34,980 --> 01:27:34,990
like I find myself trying to say now who
 

3579
01:27:34,990 --> 01:27:36,480
like I find myself trying to say now who
should I be mad at today there must be a

should I be mad at today there must be a
 

3581
01:27:36,490 --> 01:27:38,659
should I be mad at today there must be a
reason why

3582
01:27:38,659 --> 01:27:38,669
reason why
 

3583
01:27:38,669 --> 01:27:41,819
reason why
but I but then I realize you know it's

3584
01:27:41,819 --> 01:27:41,829
but I but then I realize you know it's
 

3585
01:27:41,829 --> 01:27:43,979
but I but then I realize you know it's
just my it's just my chemistry telling

3586
01:27:43,979 --> 01:27:43,989
just my it's just my chemistry telling
 

3587
01:27:43,989 --> 01:27:45,209
just my it's just my chemistry telling
me that I'm supposed to be mad at

3588
01:27:45,209 --> 01:27:45,219
me that I'm supposed to be mad at
 

3589
01:27:45,219 --> 01:27:47,039
me that I'm supposed to be mad at
somebody and so and so I triggered up

3590
01:27:47,039 --> 01:27:47,049
somebody and so and so I triggered up
 

3591
01:27:47,049 --> 01:27:50,459
somebody and so and so I triggered up
say okay go to sleep and get better but

3592
01:27:50,459 --> 01:27:50,469
say okay go to sleep and get better but
 

3593
01:27:50,469 --> 01:27:53,879
say okay go to sleep and get better but
but if I'm but if I'm not a hundred

3594
01:27:53,879 --> 01:27:53,889
but if I'm but if I'm not a hundred
 

3595
01:27:53,889 --> 01:27:56,099
but if I'm but if I'm not a hundred
percent happy that doesn't mean that I

3596
01:27:56,099 --> 01:27:56,109
percent happy that doesn't mean that I
 

3597
01:27:56,109 --> 01:27:57,869
percent happy that doesn't mean that I
should find somebody that that's

3598
01:27:57,869 --> 01:27:57,879
should find somebody that that's
 

3599
01:27:57,879 --> 01:28:00,599
should find somebody that that's
screaming and and try to size them up

3600
01:28:00,599 --> 01:28:00,609
screaming and and try to size them up
 

3601
01:28:00,609 --> 01:28:04,919
screaming and and try to size them up
but I'd be like I'm saying you know okay

3602
01:28:04,919 --> 01:28:04,929
but I'd be like I'm saying you know okay
 

3603
01:28:04,929 --> 01:28:08,399
but I'd be like I'm saying you know okay
I'm not 100% happy but but I'm happy

3605
01:28:08,409 --> 01:28:11,609
I'm not 100% happy but but I'm happy
enough to death to be a you know part of

3606

3607
01:28:11,619 --> 01:28:15,629
enough to death to be a you know part of
a sustainable situation so so that's

3608
01:28:15,629 --> 01:28:15,639
a sustainable situation so so that's
 

3609
01:28:15,639 --> 01:28:21,299
a sustainable situation so so that's
kind of the numerical analysis I do you

3610

01:28:57,549 --> 01:28:59,819
comfortable with the fact that I was
going to die someday and during that

3634
01:28:59,819 --> 01:28:59,829
going to die someday and during that
 

3635
01:28:59,829 --> 01:29:06,989
going to die someday and during that
month I don't know I I felt okay but I

3636
01:29:06,989 --> 01:29:06,999
month I don't know I I felt okay but I

couldn't do original research either
 

3641
01:29:14,109 --> 01:29:16,279
couldn't do original research either
like tighten right I sort of remember

3642
01:29:16,279 --> 01:29:16,289
like tighten right I sort of remember
 

3643
01:29:16,289 --> 01:29:19,349
like tighten right I sort of remember
after three or four weeks the first time

3644
01:29:19,349 --> 01:29:19,359
after three or four weeks the first time
 

3645
01:29:19,359 --> 01:29:21,569
after three or four weeks the first time
I started having a technical thought

3646
01:29:21,569 --> 01:29:21,579
I started having a technical thought
 

3647
01:29:21,579 --> 01:29:23,489
I started having a technical thought
that made sense and was maybe slightly

3648
01:29:23,489 --> 01:29:23,499
that made sense and was maybe slightly
 

3649
01:29:23,499 --> 01:29:25,919
that made sense and was maybe slightly
creative I could sort of feel they know

3650
01:29:25,919 --> 01:29:25,929
creative I could sort of feel they know
 

3651
01:29:25,929 --> 01:29:28,559
creative I could sort of feel they know
that and that something was starting to

3652
01:29:28,559 --> 01:29:28,569
that and that something was starting to
 

3653
01:29:28,569 --> 01:29:31,169
that and that something was starting to
move again but that was you know so I

3654
01:29:31,169 --> 01:29:31,179
move again but that was you know so I
 

3655
01:29:31,179 --> 01:29:35,789
move again but that was you know so I
felt very empty for until I came to

3656
01:29:35,789 --> 01:29:35,799
felt very empty for until I came to
 

3657
01:29:35,799 --> 01:29:39,000
felt very empty for until I came to
grips with the I yes I learned that this

3658
01:29:39,000 --> 01:29:39,010
grips with the I yes I learned that this
 

3659
01:29:39,010 --> 01:29:40,439
grips with the I yes I learned that this
is a sort of a standard grief process

3660
01:29:40,439 --> 01:29:40,449
is a sort of a standard grief process
 

3661
01:29:40,449 --> 01:29:43,859
is a sort of a standard grief process
that people go through ok so then now

3662
01:29:43,859 --> 01:29:43,869
that people go through ok so then now
 

3663
01:29:43,869 --> 01:29:47,039
that people go through ok so then now
I'm at a point in my life even more so

3664
01:29:47,039 --> 01:29:47,049
I'm at a point in my life even more so
 

3665
01:29:47,049 --> 01:29:50,379
I'm at a point in my life even more so
than in 2006 where where all of my go

3666
01:29:50,379 --> 01:29:50,389
than in 2006 where where all of my go

I'd wanted all my life to write a piece

3674
01:30:04,239 --> 01:30:04,249
I'd wanted all my life to write a piece
 

3675
01:30:04,249 --> 01:30:08,649
I'd wanted all my life to write a piece
of a piece piece of music that and I had

3676
01:30:08,649 --> 01:30:08,659
of a piece piece of music that and I had
 

3677
01:30:08,659 --> 01:30:12,129
of a piece piece of music that and I had
an idea for for a certain kind of music

3678
01:30:12,129 --> 01:30:12,139
an idea for for a certain kind of music
 

3679
01:30:12,139 --> 01:30:13,659
an idea for for a certain kind of music
that I thought ought to be written at

3680
01:30:13,659 --> 01:30:13,669
that I thought ought to be written at
 

3681
01:30:13,669 --> 01:30:15,250
that I thought ought to be written at
least somebody ought to try to do it and

3682
01:30:15,250 --> 01:30:15,260
least somebody ought to try to do it and
 

3683
01:30:15,260 --> 01:30:19,120
least somebody ought to try to do it and
I and I felt that it was a that it

3684
01:30:19,120 --> 01:30:19,130
I and I felt that it was a that it
 

3685
01:30:19,130 --> 01:30:20,560
I and I felt that it was a that it
wasn't going to be easy but I wanted to

3686
01:30:20,560 --> 01:30:20,570
wasn't going to be easy but I wanted to
 

3687
01:30:20,570 --> 01:30:24,549
wasn't going to be easy but I wanted to
I wanted it proof of concept I wanted to

3688
01:30:24,549 --> 01:30:24,559
I wanted it proof of concept I wanted to
 

3689
01:30:24,559 --> 01:30:25,839
I wanted it proof of concept I wanted to
know if it was going to work or not and

3690
01:30:25,839 --> 01:30:25,849
know if it was going to work or not and
 

3691
01:30:25,849 --> 01:30:29,080
know if it was going to work or not and
so I spent a lot of time and finally I

3692
01:30:29,080 --> 01:30:29,090
so I spent a lot of time and finally I
 

3693
01:30:29,090 --> 01:30:31,750
so I spent a lot of time and finally I
finished that piece and we had the we

3694
01:30:31,750 --> 01:30:31,760
finished that piece and we had the we
 

3695
01:30:31,760 --> 01:30:34,870
finished that piece and we had the we
had the world premiere last year on my

3696
01:30:34,870 --> 01:30:34,880
had the world premiere last year on my
 

3697
01:30:34,880 --> 01:30:36,699
had the world premiere last year on my
80th birthday and we had another

3698
01:30:36,699 --> 01:30:36,709
80th birthday and we had another
 

3699
01:30:36,709 --> 01:30:39,540
80th birthday and we had another
premiere in Canada and there's talk of

3700
01:30:39,540 --> 01:30:39,550
premiere in Canada and there's talk of
 

3701
01:30:39,550 --> 01:30:41,949
premiere in Canada and there's talk of
concerts in Europe and various things so

3702
01:30:41,949 --> 01:30:41,959
concerts in Europe and various things so
 

3703
01:30:41,959 --> 01:30:44,139
concerts in Europe and various things so
that but that's done it's part of the

3704
01:30:44,139 --> 01:30:44,149
that but that's done it's part of the
 

3705
01:30:44,149 --> 01:30:45,969
that but that's done it's part of the
world's music now and it's either good

do as well as I can with the art of
computer programming until I go see now

3716
01:31:02,080 --> 01:31:02,090
computer programming until I go see now
 

3717
01:31:02,090 --> 01:31:05,109
computer programming until I go see now
do you think there's an element of point

3718
01:31:05,109 --> 01:31:05,119
do you think there's an element of point
 

3719
01:31:05,119 --> 01:31:08,949
do you think there's an element of point
eight that might point eight yeah well I

01:31:28,239 --> 01:31:28,249
was at point eight um so when I was
 

3729
01:31:28,249 --> 01:31:30,790
was at point eight um so when I was
diagnosed with prostate cancer then I

not thought about the next step what I
 

3783
01:33:01,880 --> 01:33:03,730
not thought about the next step what I
would do after I would doubt after I

would do after I would doubt after I
 

3785

know I was comfortable with with the
 

3791
01:33:11,600 --> 01:33:14,980
know I was comfortable with with the
fact that it was at the end but but I

3792
01:33:14,980 --> 01:33:14,990
fact that it was at the end but but I
 

3793

was hoping that I would still you know
 

3795
01:33:18,320 --> 01:33:23,410
was hoping that I would still you know
be able to learn about satisfiability

3796
01:33:23,410 --> 01:33:23,420
be able to learn about satisfiability
 

3797
01:33:23,420 --> 01:33:29,080
be able to learn about satisfiability
and and also someday even write music I

3798
01:33:29,080 --> 01:33:29,090
and and also someday even write music I
 

3799

3803
01:33:35,000 --> 01:33:37,090
on the music project until 2012 so I'm
gonna be in huge trouble if I don't talk

3804
01:33:37,090 --> 01:33:37,100
gonna be in huge trouble if I don't talk

beauty there's a beauty to typography
that you've created and yet beauty is

3830
01:34:16,000 --> 01:34:16,010
that you've created and yet beauty is
 

3831

five right how does one create beautiful

3834
01:34:22,209 --> 01:34:22,219
five right how does one create beautiful
 

3835
01:34:22,219 --> 01:34:25,450
five right how does one create beautiful
letters and beautiful equations like

3836
01:34:25,450 --> 01:34:25,460
letters and beautiful equations like
 

3837

so I mean perhaps there's no words to be
 

3841
01:34:30,440 --> 01:34:33,250
so I mean perhaps there's no words to be
describing you know be described in the

01:42:21,089 --> 01:42:21,099
that I that I'm that I used arrows and
 

4167
01:42:21,099 --> 01:42:23,189
that I that I'm that I used arrows and
he used a slightly different notation

4168
01:42:23,189 --> 01:42:23,199
he used a slightly different notation
 

4169
01:42:23,199 --> 01:42:25,979
he used a slightly different notation
but anyway this and then this Ackerman's

4170
01:42:25,979 --> 01:42:25,989
but anyway this and then this Ackerman's
 

4171
01:42:25,989 --> 01:42:28,140
but anyway this and then this Ackerman's
function is is based on the same kind of

4172
01:42:28,140 --> 01:42:28,150
function is is based on the same kind of
 

4173
01:42:28,150 --> 01:42:31,470
function is is based on the same kind of
ideas but Ackerman was 1920s but anyway

4174
01:42:31,470 --> 01:42:31,480
ideas but Ackerman was 1920s but anyway
 

4175
01:42:31,480 --> 01:42:34,140
ideas but Ackerman was 1920s but anyway
you got this number 10

4176
01:42:34,140 --> 01:42:34,150
you got this number 10
 

4177
01:42:34,150 --> 01:42:37,950
you got this number 10
quadruple arrow 3 so that's that says

4178
01:42:37,950 --> 01:42:37,960
quadruple arrow 3 so that's that says
 

4179
01:42:37,960 --> 01:42:41,700
quadruple arrow 3 so that's that says
well we take you know we take 10 to the

4180
01:42:41,700 --> 01:42:41,710
well we take you know we take 10 to the
 

4181
01:42:41,710 --> 01:42:44,280
well we take you know we take 10 to the
10 to the 10 to the 10 to the 10 to the

4182
01:42:44,280 --> 01:42:44,290
10 to the 10 to the 10 to the 10 to the
 

4183
01:42:44,290 --> 01:42:46,589
10 to the 10 to the 10 to the 10 to the
10th anyway how many times do we do that

4184
01:42:46,589 --> 01:42:46,599
10th anyway how many times do we do that
 

4185
01:42:46,599 --> 01:42:49,470
10th anyway how many times do we do that
oh Ken double arrow two times or

4186
01:42:49,470 --> 01:42:49,480
oh Ken double arrow two times or
 

4187
01:42:49,480 --> 01:42:51,780
oh Ken double arrow two times or
something I mean how tall is that stack

4188
01:42:51,780 --> 01:42:51,790
something I mean how tall is that stack
 

4189
01:42:51,790 --> 01:42:54,060
something I mean how tall is that stack
but but but then we do that again

4190
01:42:54,060 --> 01:42:54,070
but but but then we do that again
 

4191
01:42:54,070 --> 01:42:56,310
but but but then we do that again
because that was the only 10 triple

4192
01:42:56,310 --> 01:42:56,320
because that was the only 10 triple
 

4193
01:42:56,320 --> 01:42:59,609
because that was the only 10 triple
quadruple arrow to we take quadruple

4194
01:42:59,609 --> 01:42:59,619
quadruple arrow to we take quadruple
 

4195
01:42:59,619 --> 01:43:01,919
quadruple arrow to we take quadruple
three large number it

4196
01:43:01,919 --> 01:43:01,929
three large number it
 

4197
01:43:01,929 --> 01:43:06,300
three large number it
gets way beyond comprehension okay yeah

4198
01:43:06,300 --> 01:43:06,310
gets way beyond comprehension okay yeah
 

4199
01:43:06,310 --> 01:43:11,160
gets way beyond comprehension okay yeah
and and and so but it's so small

4200
01:43:11,160 --> 01:43:11,170
and and and so but it's so small
 

4201
01:43:11,170 --> 01:43:13,200
and and and so but it's so small
compared to what finite numbers really

4202
01:43:13,200 --> 01:43:13,210
compared to what finite numbers really
 

4203
01:43:13,210 --> 01:43:15,780
compared to what finite numbers really
are because I want to using four arrows

4204
01:43:15,780 --> 01:43:15,790
are because I want to using four arrows
 

4205
01:43:15,790 --> 01:43:17,990
are because I want to using four arrows
and you know in ten and a three I mean

4206
01:43:17,990 --> 01:43:18,000
and you know in ten and a three I mean
 

4207
01:43:18,000 --> 01:43:21,479
and you know in ten and a three I mean
let's have that let's have that many

4208
01:43:21,479 --> 01:43:21,489
let's have that let's have that many
 

4209
01:43:21,489 --> 01:43:23,939
let's have that let's have that many
number arrows I mean the boundary

4210
01:43:23,939 --> 01:43:23,949
number arrows I mean the boundary
 

4211
01:43:23,949 --> 01:43:26,689
number arrows I mean the boundary
between infinite and finite is

4212
01:43:26,689 --> 01:43:26,699
between infinite and finite is
 

4213
01:43:26,699 --> 01:43:29,270
between infinite and finite is
incomprehensible for us humans anyway

4214
01:43:29,270 --> 01:43:29,280
incomprehensible for us humans anyway
 

4215
01:43:29,280 --> 01:43:32,550
incomprehensible for us humans anyway
infinity is a good is a useful way for

4216
01:43:32,550 --> 01:43:32,560
infinity is a good is a useful way for
 

4217
01:43:32,560 --> 01:43:36,380
infinity is a good is a useful way for
us to think about extremely large

4218
01:43:36,380 --> 01:43:36,390
us to think about extremely large
 

4219
01:43:36,390 --> 01:43:42,870
us to think about extremely large
extremely large things and and and and

4220
01:43:42,870 --> 01:43:42,880
extremely large things and and and and
 

4221
01:43:42,880 --> 01:43:46,950
extremely large things and and and and
we we can manipulate it but but we can

4222
01:43:46,950 --> 01:43:46,960
we we can manipulate it but but we can
 

4223
01:43:46,960 --> 01:43:49,169
we we can manipulate it but but we can
never know that the universe is actually

4224
01:43:49,169 --> 01:43:49,179
never know that the universe is actually
 

4225
01:43:49,179 --> 01:43:57,959
never know that the universe is actually
and we're near that so it just so I

4226
01:43:57,959 --> 01:43:57,969
and we're near that so it just so I
 

4227
01:43:57,969 --> 01:44:03,000
and we're near that so it just so I
realize how little we know but but but

4228
01:44:03,000 --> 01:44:03,010
realize how little we know but but but
 

4229
01:44:03,010 --> 01:44:09,209
realize how little we know but but but
what we we found an awful lot of things

4230
01:44:09,209 --> 01:44:09,219
what we we found an awful lot of things
 

4231
01:44:09,219 --> 01:44:11,939
what we we found an awful lot of things
that are too hard for any one person to

4232
01:44:11,939 --> 01:44:11,949
that are too hard for any one person to
 

4233
01:44:11,949 --> 01:44:13,620
that are too hard for any one person to
know even with even in our small

4234
01:44:13,620 --> 01:44:13,630
know even with even in our small
 

4235
01:44:13,630 --> 01:44:17,060
know even with even in our small
universe yeah and we did pretty good so

4236
01:44:17,060 --> 01:44:17,070
universe yeah and we did pretty good so
 

4237
01:44:17,070 --> 01:44:19,560
universe yeah and we did pretty good so
when you go up to heaven and meet God

and get to ask one question that would

4240
01:44:23,970 --> 01:44:23,980
and get to ask one question that would
 

4241
01:44:23,980 --> 01:44:29,630
and get to ask one question that would
get answered what question would you ask
