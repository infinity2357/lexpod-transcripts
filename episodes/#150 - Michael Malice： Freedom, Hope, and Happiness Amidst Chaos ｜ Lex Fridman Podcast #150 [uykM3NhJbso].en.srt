are being oppressive so the argument
 

3857
01:06:38,160 --> 01:06:40,710
are being oppressive so the argument
that you can separate nazism from

3858
01:06:40,710 --> 01:06:40,720
that you can separate nazism from
 

3859
01:06:40,720 --> 01:06:42,789

01:06:45,520 --> 01:06:47,589
people have and my perspective is
i think it's

3864
01:06:47,589 --> 01:06:47,599
i think it's
 

3865
01:06:47,599 --> 01:06:50,150
i think it's
i do not find it convincing that you can

3866
01:06:50,150 --> 01:06:50,160
i do not find it convincing that you can
 

3867
01:06:50,160 --> 01:06:52,630
i do not find it convincing that you can
separate those two i think anti-semitism

3868
01:06:52,630 --> 01:06:52,640
separate those two i think anti-semitism
 

3869
01:06:52,640 --> 01:06:55,109
separate those two i think anti-semitism
was essential to nazism i think nazism

was essential to nazism i think nazism
 

3871

and mussolini's fascism have very big
 

3873
01:06:57,680 --> 01:07:00,630
and mussolini's fascism have very big
differences um and do you think uh do

3874
01:07:00,630 --> 01:07:00,640

you think anti-semitism was fundamental

3876
01:07:02,950 --> 01:07:02,960

to who hitler was or was it just that so

3878
01:07:05,910 --> 01:07:05,920
to who hitler was or was it just that so
 

3879
01:07:05,920 --> 01:07:07,510
to who hitler was or was it just that so
this is the interesting thing is like it

3880
01:07:07,510 --> 01:07:07,520
this is the interesting thing is like it
 

3881
01:07:07,520 --> 01:07:10,309
this is the interesting thing is like it
was it a tool that he saw

3882
01:07:10,309 --> 01:07:10,319
was it a tool that he saw
 

3883
01:07:10,319 --> 01:07:11,750
was it a tool that he saw
as being

3884
01:07:11,750 --> 01:07:11,760
as being
 

3885
01:07:11,760 --> 01:07:14,630
as being
effective no he believed it

3886
01:07:14,630 --> 01:07:14,640
effective no he believed it
 

3887
01:07:14,640 --> 01:07:17,029
effective no he believed it
so why do you see those as intricately

3888
01:07:17,029 --> 01:07:17,039
so why do you see those as intricately
 

3889
01:07:17,039 --> 01:07:18,789
so why do you see those as intricately
connected could uh hitler have

3890
01:07:18,789 --> 01:07:18,799
connected could uh hitler have
 

3891
01:07:18,799 --> 01:07:20,150
connected could uh hitler have
accomplished

3892
01:07:20,150 --> 01:07:20,160
accomplished
 

3893
01:07:20,160 --> 01:07:22,390
accomplished
the same amount or more

3894
01:07:22,390 --> 01:07:22,400
the same amount or more
 

3895
01:07:22,400 --> 01:07:24,150
the same amount or more
without the holocaust yeah because think

3896
01:07:24,150 --> 01:07:24,160

3897
01:07:24,160 --> 01:07:26,549
without the holocaust yeah because think
about how many resources you have divert

3898
01:07:26,549 --> 01:07:26,559
about how many resources you have divert
 

3899
01:07:26,559 --> 01:07:28,069
about how many resources you have divert
at a time where you have operation

3900
01:07:28,069 --> 01:07:28,079
at a time where you have operation
 

3901
01:07:28,079 --> 01:07:30,069
at a time where you have operation

connected why are they so connected
 

3905
01:07:32,720 --> 01:07:34,789
connected why are they so connected
uh is it because

3906
01:07:34,789 --> 01:07:34,799
uh is it because
 

3907
01:07:34,799 --> 01:07:37,029
uh is it because
hitler was insane or was he a bad

3908
01:07:37,029 --> 01:07:37,039
hitler was insane or was he a bad

01:08:10,240 --> 01:08:14,069
scapegoating
is a big part and parcel of uh the nazi

3944
01:08:14,069 --> 01:08:14,079
is a big part and parcel of uh the nazi
 

3945
01:08:14,079 --> 01:08:15,270
is a big part and parcel of uh the nazi
mythology

3946
01:08:15,270 --> 01:08:15,280
mythology
 

3947
01:08:15,280 --> 01:08:17,510
mythology
and this kind of one universal figure

3948
01:08:17,510 --> 01:08:17,520
and this kind of one universal figure
 

3949
01:08:17,520 --> 01:08:19,510
and this kind of one universal figure
explain you know this kind of you know

3950
01:08:19,510 --> 01:08:19,520
explain you know this kind of you know
 

3951
01:08:19,520 --> 01:08:21,110
explain you know this kind of you know
skeleton key but it could have been the

3952
01:08:21,110 --> 01:08:21,120
skeleton key but it could have been the
 

3953
01:08:21,120 --> 01:08:23,030
skeleton key but it could have been the
communists i mean that that could have

3954
01:08:23,030 --> 01:08:23,040
communists i mean that that could have
 

3955
01:08:23,040 --> 01:08:24,709
communists i mean that that could have
been the source of the hatred so like

3956
01:08:24,709 --> 01:08:24,719
been the source of the hatred so like
 

3957
01:08:24,719 --> 01:08:26,229
been the source of the hatred so like
the communists didn't get germany into

3958
01:08:26,229 --> 01:08:26,239
the communists didn't get germany into
 

3959
01:08:26,239 --> 01:08:28,470
the communists didn't get germany into
world war one like he said the jews did

3960
01:08:28,470 --> 01:08:28,480
world war one like he said the jews did
 

3961
01:08:28,480 --> 01:08:30,070
world war one like he said the jews did
it seems to me

3962
01:08:30,070 --> 01:08:30,080
it seems to me
 

3963
01:08:30,080 --> 01:08:31,110
it seems to me
that

3964
01:08:31,110 --> 01:08:31,120
that
 

3965
01:08:31,120 --> 01:08:34,470
that
the atrocity of the holocaust

3966
01:08:34,470 --> 01:08:34,480
the atrocity of the holocaust
 

3967
01:08:34,480 --> 01:08:37,030
the atrocity of the holocaust
is the reason we see hitler's evil no

3968
01:08:37,030 --> 01:08:37,040
is the reason we see hitler's evil no
 

3969
01:08:37,040 --> 01:08:38,390
is the reason we see hitler's evil no
the reason we see hitler is evil is

3970
01:08:38,390 --> 01:08:38,400
the reason we see hitler is evil is
 

3971
01:08:38,400 --> 01:08:40,309
the reason we see hitler is evil is
because of world war ii propaganda still

3972
01:08:40,309 --> 01:08:40,319
because of world war ii propaganda still
 

3973
01:08:40,319 --> 01:08:41,990
because of world war ii propaganda still
because we don't see stalin as evil

3974
01:08:41,990 --> 01:08:42,000
because we don't see stalin as evil
 

3975
01:08:42,000 --> 01:08:43,510
because we don't see stalin as evil
right that's what we don't see mao is

3976
01:08:43,510 --> 01:08:43,520
right that's what we don't see mao is
 

3977
01:08:43,520 --> 01:08:45,349
right that's what we don't see mao is
evil to that extent

3978
01:08:45,349 --> 01:08:45,359
evil to that extent
 

3979
01:08:45,359 --> 01:08:47,269
evil to that extent
uh i think that why like why would you

3980
01:08:47,269 --> 01:08:47,279
uh i think that why like why would you
 

3981
01:08:47,279 --> 01:08:48,630
uh i think that why like why would you
say that you know what because nature

3982
01:08:48,630 --> 01:08:48,640
say that you know what because nature
 

3983
01:08:48,640 --> 01:08:49,749
say that you know what because nature
that propaganda

3984
01:08:49,749 --> 01:08:49,759
that propaganda
 

3985
01:08:49,759 --> 01:08:52,229
that propaganda
because i think a lot of the problem for

3986
01:08:52,229 --> 01:08:52,239
because i think a lot of the problem for
 

3987
01:08:52,239 --> 01:08:54,309

they invented the term social fascist
 

4127
01:11:15,840 --> 01:11:18,390
they invented the term social fascist
for them so instead of they're just like

01:11:18,390 --> 01:11:18,400
for them so instead of they're just like
 

4129
01:11:18,400 --> 01:11:20,229
for them so instead of they're just like
like jihadis instead of taking their

01:11:20,229 --> 01:11:20,239
like jihadis instead of taking their
 

4131
01:11:20,239 --> 01:11:22,709
like jihadis instead of taking their
sights on nazism they set their sights

4133
01:11:22,719 --> 01:11:25,189
sights on nazism they set their sights
on the moderates because they wanted

4134
01:11:25,189 --> 01:11:25,199
on the moderates because they wanted
 

4135
01:11:25,199 --> 01:11:26,870
on the moderates because they wanted
they figured the choice between hitler

4136
01:11:26,870 --> 01:11:26,880
they figured the choice between hitler
 

4137
01:11:26,880 --> 01:11:28,950
they figured the choice between hitler
and us were going to win and this was a

4138
01:11:28,950 --> 01:11:28,960
and us were going to win and this was a
 

4139
01:11:28,960 --> 01:11:31,270
and us were going to win and this was a
huge gamble and it they were all killed

4140
01:11:31,270 --> 01:11:31,280
huge gamble and it they were all killed
 

4141
01:11:31,280 --> 01:11:33,110
huge gamble and it they were all killed
in or had to flee and the ones who fled

4142
01:11:33,110 --> 01:11:33,120
in or had to flee and the ones who fled
 

4143
01:11:33,120 --> 01:11:35,270
in or had to flee and the ones who fled
were killed also by stalin said that to

4144
01:11:35,270 --> 01:11:35,280
were killed also by stalin said that to
 

4145
01:11:35,280 --> 01:11:38,149
were killed also by stalin said that to
my understanding so this is an easy way

4146
01:11:38,149 --> 01:11:38,159
my understanding so this is an easy way
 

4147
01:11:38,159 --> 01:11:39,910
my understanding so this is an easy way
where he could have been uh certainly

01:48:38,880 --> 01:48:41,109
chris cantwell but that was in the
context of that book right so there's

6266
01:48:41,109 --> 01:48:41,119
context of that book right so there's
 

6267
01:48:41,119 --> 01:48:42,790
context of that book right so there's
lots of people who

6268
01:48:42,790 --> 01:48:42,800
lots of people who
 

6269
01:48:42,800 --> 01:48:45,510
lots of people who
people want me to have on my show

6270
01:48:45,510 --> 01:48:45,520
people want me to have on my show
 

6271
01:48:45,520 --> 01:48:46,790
people want me to have on my show
and the way i look at it is like you

6272
01:48:46,790 --> 01:48:46,800
and the way i look at it is like you
 

6273
01:48:46,800 --> 01:48:48,470
and the way i look at it is like you
have a table and a tablecloth right and

6274
01:48:48,470 --> 01:48:48,480
have a table and a tablecloth right and
 

6275
01:48:48,480 --> 01:48:50,229
have a table and a tablecloth right and
let's suppose the table is

6276
01:48:50,229 --> 01:48:50,239
let's suppose the table is
 

6277
01:48:50,239 --> 01:48:53,270
let's suppose the table is
a three feet wide the tablecloth is two

6278
01:48:53,270 --> 01:48:53,280
a three feet wide the tablecloth is two
 

6279
01:48:53,280 --> 01:48:54,390
a three feet wide the tablecloth is two
feet wide

6280
01:48:54,390 --> 01:48:54,400
feet wide
 

6281
01:48:54,400 --> 01:48:56,629
feet wide
so if i move the tablecloth to the right

6282
01:48:56,629 --> 01:48:56,639
so if i move the tablecloth to the right
 

6283
01:48:56,639 --> 01:48:58,390
so if i move the tablecloth to the right
i'm gonna lose people on the left i can

6284
01:48:58,390 --> 01:48:58,400
i'm gonna lose people on the left i can
 

6285
01:48:58,400 --> 01:49:00,629
i'm gonna lose people on the left i can
only cover so much space and the further

6286
01:49:00,629 --> 01:49:00,639
only cover so much space and the further
 

6287
01:49:00,639 --> 01:49:02,550
only cover so much space and the further
you go on the fringe in one direction

6288
01:49:02,550 --> 01:49:02,560
you go on the fringe in one direction
 

6289
01:49:02,560 --> 01:49:04,470
you go on the fringe in one direction
the more mainstream you're going to lose

6290
01:49:04,470 --> 01:49:04,480
the more mainstream you're going to lose
 

6291
01:49:04,480 --> 01:49:06,550
the more mainstream you're going to lose
in the other direction so i'm very much

6292
01:49:06,550 --> 01:49:06,560
in the other direction so i'm very much
 

6293
01:49:06,560 --> 01:49:08,629
in the other direction so i'm very much
making a conscious choice

6294
01:49:08,629 --> 01:49:08,639
making a conscious choice
 

6295
01:49:08,639 --> 01:49:09,510

think like this or i can't
because i'm not sure about the points

7637
02:11:57,760 --> 02:11:58,950
has to be dependent on this issue what's
amazing about minikism which

7638
02:11:58,950 --> 02:11:58,960
amazing about minikism which
 

7639
02:11:58,960 --> 02:12:01,990
amazing about minikism which
objectivists are is they will argue

7640
02:12:01,990 --> 02:12:02,000
objectivists are is they will argue
 

7641
02:12:02,000 --> 02:12:04,790

that government is really really bad at
 

7643
02:12:04,800 --> 02:12:06,950
that government is really really bad at
everything it does and it touches

7644
02:12:06,950 --> 02:12:06,960
everything it does and it touches
 

7645

everything it does and it touches
therefore

7646
02:12:08,149 --> 02:12:08,159
therefore
 

7647
02:12:08,159 --> 02:12:10,069
therefore
it has to be in charge of the most

7648
02:12:10,069 --> 02:12:10,079
it has to be in charge of the most
 

7649

something has been worked out perhaps

7812
02:14:58,709 --> 02:14:58,719
something has been worked out perhaps
 

7813
02:14:58,719 --> 02:15:00,550
something has been worked out perhaps
not perhaps don't say perhaps you know

02:15:04,790 --> 02:15:04,800
point i'm trying to make so let's say
 

7819
02:15:04,800 --> 02:15:07,030
point i'm trying to make so let's say
for sure it's been worked out there is a

02:15:09,040 --> 02:15:10,470
there was a point in history where it
wasn't worked out

02:15:12,870 --> 02:15:12,880
like to to to work
 

7827
02:15:12,880 --> 02:15:15,109
like to to to work
to come to a place of stability there

7828
02:15:15,109 --> 02:15:15,119
to come to a place of stability there
 

7829
02:15:15,119 --> 02:15:17,109
to come to a place of stability there
has to first be some instability so you

7830
02:15:17,109 --> 02:15:17,119
has to first be some instability so you
 

7831
02:15:17,119 --> 02:15:18,390
has to first be some instability so you
when you first

7832
02:15:18,390 --> 02:15:18,400
when you first
 

7833
02:15:18,400 --> 02:15:21,830
when you first
like for every kind of situation

02:15:21,830 --> 02:15:21,840
like for every kind of situation
 

7835
02:15:21,840 --> 02:15:24,149
like for every kind of situation
they're like dispute over space like who

02:15:24,149 --> 02:15:24,159
they're like dispute over space like who
 

7837
02:15:24,159 --> 02:15:26,310
they're like dispute over space like who
gets to own mars that kind of thing sure

7838
02:15:26,310 --> 02:15:26,320

7839
02:15:26,320 --> 02:15:29,030
gets to own mars that kind of thing sure
there's a first for it and then these

7840
02:15:29,030 --> 02:15:29,040
there's a first for it and then these
 

7841
02:15:29,040 --> 02:15:31,430
there's a first for it and then these
different competing institutions will

7842
02:15:31,430 --> 02:15:31,440
different competing institutions will
 

7843
02:15:31,440 --> 02:15:33,510
different competing institutions will
have to figure it out

7844
02:15:33,510 --> 02:15:33,520
have to figure it out
 

7845
02:15:33,520 --> 02:15:34,950
have to figure it out
and so there's the concern with

7846
02:15:34,950 --> 02:15:34,960
and so there's the concern with
 

7847
02:15:34,960 --> 02:15:37,510
and so there's the concern with
anarchism i think or with any kind of

7848
02:15:37,510 --> 02:15:37,520
anarchism i think or with any kind of
 

7849
02:15:37,520 --> 02:15:39,430
anarchism i think or with any kind of
interaction what you said

7850
02:15:39,430 --> 02:15:39,440
interaction what you said
 

7851
02:15:39,440 --> 02:15:41,030
interaction what you said
brilliantly that there's

02:15:41,030 --> 02:15:41,040
brilliantly that there's
 

7853
02:15:41,040 --> 02:15:43,189
brilliantly that there's
an anarchism relative to the there's no

7854
02:15:43,189 --> 02:15:43,199
an anarchism relative to the there's no

that there's going to be an instability
that's that that doesn't converge

that's that that doesn't converge
 

7869

that's that that doesn't converge

02:16:37,509 --> 02:16:37,519
anarchism i think is that
 

7909
02:16:37,519 --> 02:16:39,589
anarchism i think is that
it will be non-creative destruction

7910
02:16:39,589 --> 02:16:39,599
it will be non-creative destruction
 

7911
02:16:39,599 --> 02:16:42,230
it will be non-creative destruction
it'll be just destruction

it'll be just destruction
 

7913

right
 

7915
02:16:42,960 --> 02:16:45,750
right
it's not like the instability let's give

7916

it's not like the instability let's give

you
 

7919
02:16:46,399 --> 02:16:48,389
you
there's no stability is one of these

7920
02:16:48,389 --> 02:16:48,399
there's no stability is one of these
 

7921

real meaning what field has stability if

7924
02:16:54,549 --> 02:16:54,559
real meaning what field has stability if
 

7925
02:16:54,559 --> 02:16:56,150
real meaning what field has stability if
you had let's suppose you want stability

relationships yeah let's talk about

7928
02:16:58,070 --> 02:16:58,080
relationships yeah let's talk about
 

7929
02:16:58,080 --> 02:16:59,910
relationships yeah let's talk about
medicine stability means we're not going

7930
02:16:59,910 --> 02:16:59,920

02:16:59,920 --> 02:17:01,910

to invent new diseases or new treatments
 

7933
02:17:01,920 --> 02:17:04,230
to invent new diseases or new treatments
right if you mean stability in terms of

7934
02:17:04,230 --> 02:17:04,240
right if you mean stability in terms of
 

7935
02:17:04,240 --> 02:17:06,709
right if you mean stability in terms of
a baseline of security

7936
02:17:06,709 --> 02:17:06,719
a baseline of security
 

7937
02:17:06,719 --> 02:17:08,389
a baseline of security
we have that already

7938
02:17:08,389 --> 02:17:08,399
we have that already
 

7939
02:17:08,399 --> 02:17:11,270
we have that already
very few relationships turn violent

7940
02:17:11,270 --> 02:17:11,280
very few relationships turn violent
 

7941
02:17:11,280 --> 02:17:13,270
very few relationships turn violent
under an anarchist system look at it

7942
02:17:13,270 --> 02:17:13,280
under an anarchist system look at it
 

7943
02:17:13,280 --> 02:17:17,030
under an anarchist system look at it
right now where if you look at a bar

7944
02:17:17,030 --> 02:17:17,040
right now where if you look at a bar
 

7945
02:17:17,040 --> 02:17:18,950
right now where if you look at a bar

02:17:18,960 --> 02:17:22,230
full of drunken young males full of
testosterone if you look at a hotel

7948
02:17:22,230 --> 02:17:22,240

02:17:25,519 --> 02:17:29,030
where everyone is not native to the area
those are both far safer than the places

7952
02:17:29,030 --> 02:17:29,040
those are both far safer than the places
 

7953
02:17:29,040 --> 02:17:30,790
those are both far safer than the places
that the government has taken upon

7954
02:17:30,790 --> 02:17:30,800
that the government has taken upon
 

7955
02:17:30,800 --> 02:17:33,589
that the government has taken upon
itself to protect you the parks the

02:17:36,469 --> 02:17:36,479
alleyways the streets the subways we
 

7959
02:17:36,479 --> 02:17:39,190
alleyways the streets the subways we
have right now a comparison of which is

7960
02:17:39,190 --> 02:17:39,200
have right now a comparison of which is
 

7961
02:17:39,200 --> 02:17:41,509
have right now a comparison of which is
better at keeping people safe and it's

7962
02:17:41,509 --> 02:17:41,519
better at keeping people safe and it's
 

7963
02:17:41,519 --> 02:17:43,830
better at keeping people safe and it's
very obvious that when it's something is

7964
02:17:43,830 --> 02:17:43,840
very obvious that when it's something is
 

7965
02:17:43,840 --> 02:17:46,230
very obvious that when it's something is
private and under someone's control and

7966
02:17:46,230 --> 02:17:46,240
private and under someone's control and
 

7967
02:17:46,240 --> 02:17:47,830
private and under someone's control and
there would be layers of there'd be more

and that's not an unrealistic concern
 

8033
02:18:50,479 --> 02:18:52,230
and that's not an unrealistic concern
are there mechanisms right now that you

are there mechanisms right now that you
 

8035
02:18:52,240 --> 02:18:53,830
are there mechanisms right now that you
can undertake to make sure that's not

kosher juice who keep kosher their food
 

8049
02:19:08,719 --> 02:19:10,309
kosher juice who keep kosher their food
has to be prepared in a certain way it

8050
02:19:10,309 --> 02:19:10,319
has to be prepared in a certain way it
 

8051
02:19:10,319 --> 02:19:12,309
has to be prepared in a certain way it
has to meet higher rabbinical standards

has to meet higher rabbinical standards
 

8053
02:19:12,319 --> 02:19:14,629
has to meet higher rabbinical standards
right if you look at food

8054
02:19:14,629 --> 02:19:14,639
right if you look at food
 

8055
02:19:14,639 --> 02:19:17,190
right if you look at food
it will have that certification decay

8056
02:19:17,190 --> 02:19:17,200
it will have that certification decay
 

8057
02:19:17,200 --> 02:19:18,309
it will have that certification decay
and there's even competition there

8058
02:19:18,309 --> 02:19:18,319
and there's even competition there
 

8059
02:19:18,319 --> 02:19:20,230
and there's even competition there
there's decay and there's a stricter u

8060
02:19:20,230 --> 02:19:20,240
there's decay and there's a stricter u
 

8061
02:19:20,240 --> 02:19:21,349
there's decay and there's a stricter u
letter people don't notice it because

they're looking for it right you would
 

8065
02:19:22,719 --> 02:19:25,830
they're looking for it right you would
have companies certifying different

have companies certifying different
 

8067
02:19:25,840 --> 02:19:28,790
have companies certifying different
locales for their level of security and

locales for their level of security and
 

8069
02:19:28,800 --> 02:19:29,830
locales for their level of security and
it would take

8070
02:19:29,830 --> 02:19:29,840
it would take
 

8071
02:19:29,840 --> 02:19:30,870
it would take
an hour

8072
02:19:30,870 --> 02:19:30,880
an hour
 

8073
02:19:30,880 --> 02:19:32,150
an hour
to have an app

8074

02:19:32,160 --> 02:19:33,429
to have an app
that would just like when you have toll

that would just like when you have toll
 

8077
02:19:33,439 --> 02:19:35,589
that would just like when you have toll
roads right that would tell you you're

so the idea of the implausibility of
 

8131
02:20:22,399 --> 02:20:24,230
so the idea of the implausibility of
having different security

8132
02:20:24,230 --> 02:20:24,240
having different security
 

8133
02:20:24,240 --> 02:20:26,550
having different security
companies and having it be unstable or

8134
02:20:26,550 --> 02:20:26,560
companies and having it be unstable or
 

8135
02:20:26,560 --> 02:20:29,830
companies and having it be unstable or
impossible we already have a very rough

8136
02:20:29,830 --> 02:20:29,840
impossible we already have a very rough
 

8137
02:20:29,840 --> 02:20:31,830
impossible we already have a very rough
example of it happening in real life but

8138
02:20:31,830 --> 02:20:31,840
example of it happening in real life but
 

8139
02:20:31,840 --> 02:20:34,950
example of it happening in real life but
all of it started this is what this like

8140
02:20:34,950 --> 02:20:34,960
all of it started this is what this like
 

8141
02:20:34,960 --> 02:20:36,550
all of it started this is what this like
the idea of

8142
02:20:36,550 --> 02:20:36,560
the idea of
 

8143
02:20:36,560 --> 02:20:39,750
the idea of
especially with euron is like it all

8144
02:20:39,750 --> 02:20:39,760
especially with euron is like it all
 

8145
02:20:39,760 --> 02:20:42,070

started with government monopoly of
violence saying like in all kids

8148
02:20:44,710 --> 02:20:44,720
violence saying like in all kids
 

8149

don't let violence get out of hand

8150
02:20:47,030 --> 02:20:47,040
don't let violence get out of hand
 

8151
02:20:47,040 --> 02:20:49,670
don't let violence get out of hand
so like we had a civil war where half

8152
02:20:49,670 --> 02:20:49,680
so like we had a civil war where half
 

8153
02:20:49,680 --> 02:20:51,910
so like we had a civil war where half
the country was slaughtered that's the

8154
02:20:51,910 --> 02:20:51,920
the country was slaughtered that's the
 

8155
02:20:51,920 --> 02:20:53,830
the country was slaughtered that's the
display of the government

8156
02:20:53,830 --> 02:20:53,840
display of the government
 

8157
02:20:53,840 --> 02:20:56,070
display of the government
not having a monopoly on the violence

8158
02:20:56,070 --> 02:20:56,080
not having a monopoly on the violence
 

8159
02:20:56,080 --> 02:20:58,230
not having a monopoly on the violence
right it's like it's

8160
02:20:58,230 --> 02:20:58,240
right it's like it's
 

8161
02:20:58,240 --> 02:20:59,910
right it's like it's
it had such a monopoly on the violence

8162
02:20:59,910 --> 02:20:59,920
it had such a monopoly on the violence
 

8163
02:20:59,920 --> 02:21:02,070
it had such a monopoly on the violence
in the north that it could draft people

8164
02:21:02,070 --> 02:21:02,080
in the north that it could draft people
 

8165
02:21:02,080 --> 02:21:03,429
in the north that it could draft people
to fight others that they didn't even

8166
02:21:03,429 --> 02:21:03,439
to fight others that they didn't even
 

8167
02:21:03,439 --> 02:21:05,030
to fight others that they didn't even
care but there's a south so it's like

8168
02:21:05,030 --> 02:21:05,040
care but there's a south so it's like
 

8169

it's the government splitting
 

8173
02:21:09,520 --> 02:21:11,830
it's the government splitting
okay so because this is giant iceberg

8174
02:21:11,830 --> 02:21:11,840
okay so because this is giant iceberg
 

8175
02:21:11,840 --> 02:21:14,469
okay so because this is giant iceberg
like splitting it's it's

8176
02:21:14,469 --> 02:21:14,479
like splitting it's it's
 

8177
02:21:14,479 --> 02:21:16,230
like splitting it's it's
the the argument is that you would have

8178
02:21:16,230 --> 02:21:16,240
the the argument is that you would have
 

8179
02:21:16,240 --> 02:21:17,990
the the argument is that you would have
something like a civil war much more

8180
02:21:17,990 --> 02:21:18,000
something like a civil war much more
 

8181
02:21:18,000 --> 02:21:20,790
something like a civil war much more
often under anarchism but that's that's

8182
02:21:20,790 --> 02:21:20,800
often under anarchism but that's that's
 

8183
02:21:20,800 --> 02:21:22,389
often under anarchism but that's that's
that's first of all if you had a civil

8184
02:21:22,389 --> 02:21:22,399
that's first of all if you had a civil
 

8185
02:21:22,399 --> 02:21:23,110
that's first of all if you had a civil
war

8186
02:21:23,110 --> 02:21:23,120
war
 

8187
02:21:23,120 --> 02:21:25,030

much more often
 

8189
02:21:25,040 --> 02:21:27,190
much more often
we don't have that with car companies

we don't have that with car companies
 

8191
02:21:27,200 --> 02:21:29,030
we don't have that with car companies
right there's no car company that says i

8192
02:21:29,030 --> 02:21:29,040
right there's no car company that says i

i'm playing this it isn't that i'll
never finish it is violence because if

8200
02:21:37,429 --> 02:21:37,439
never finish it is violence because if
 

8201
02:21:37,439 --> 02:21:40,230
never finish it is violence because if
i'm a company and i'm saying that my

is a rough analog that's
 

8209
02:21:46,640 --> 02:21:49,110
is a rough analog that's
why has that not happened now in terms

why has that not happened now in terms

let's go by evidence

let's go by evidence
 

8237
02:22:13,600 --> 02:22:15,670
let's go by evidence
how many places do we have evidence of

02:22:15,670 --> 02:22:15,680
how many places do we have evidence of

well that's absolutely a large scale

8242
02:22:20,790 --> 02:22:20,800
well that's absolutely a large scale
 

8243
02:22:20,800 --> 02:22:22,790
well that's absolutely a large scale
because it feels like once you don't

kuwait's an example of this kuwait was
 

8341
02:24:01,200 --> 02:24:03,750
kuwait's an example of this kuwait was
invaded by iraq and very quickly all the

02:24:03,750 --> 02:24:03,760
invaded by iraq and very quickly all the

having your stability safe space

8346
02:24:08,550 --> 02:24:08,560
having your stability safe space

kuwait if you had this company that was
waging more in the population it seems

8352
02:24:16,070 --> 02:24:16,080
waging more in the population it seems
 

8353
02:24:16,080 --> 02:24:17,990
waging more in the population it seems
quite likely that the other organization

8354
02:24:17,990 --> 02:24:18,000
quite likely that the other organization
 

8355
02:24:18,000 --> 02:24:19,750
quite likely that the other organization
would get together put a stop to this

8356
02:24:19,750 --> 02:24:19,760
would get together put a stop to this
 

8357
02:24:19,760 --> 02:24:20,950
would get together put a stop to this
because they're not a position to

8358
02:24:20,950 --> 02:24:20,960
because they're not a position to
 

8359
02:24:20,960 --> 02:24:22,790
because they're not a position to
provide the services security to their

provide the services security to their
 

8361
02:24:22,800 --> 02:24:25,270
provide the services security to their
customers okay all this is brilliant but

8362
02:24:25,270 --> 02:24:25,280
customers okay all this is brilliant but
 

8363
02:24:25,280 --> 02:24:27,030
customers okay all this is brilliant but
didn't you just say

8364
02:24:27,030 --> 02:24:27,040
didn't you just say
 

8365
02:24:27,040 --> 02:24:29,590
didn't you just say
that we are actually in a state of

8366
02:24:29,590 --> 02:24:29,600
that we are actually in a state of
 

8367
02:24:29,600 --> 02:24:30,870
that we are actually in a state of
anarchism

8368
02:24:30,870 --> 02:24:30,880
anarchism
 

8369
02:24:30,880 --> 02:24:32,870
anarchism
relative to other countries yes

8370
02:24:32,870 --> 02:24:32,880
relative to other countries yes
 

8371
02:24:32,880 --> 02:24:33,750
relative to other countries yes
so

8372
02:24:33,750 --> 02:24:33,760
so
 

8373
02:24:33,760 --> 02:24:35,670
so
isn't this what emerges this is this is

8374
02:24:35,670 --> 02:24:35,680
isn't this what emerges this is this is
 

8375
02:24:35,680 --> 02:24:36,550
isn't this what emerges this is this is
what

8376
02:24:36,550 --> 02:24:36,560
what
 

8377
02:24:36,560 --> 02:24:38,389
what
aren't we actually living in a state of

8378
02:24:38,389 --> 02:24:38,399
aren't we actually living in a state of
 

8379
02:24:38,399 --> 02:24:41,750
aren't we actually living in a state of
anarchism where we all have agreed

8380
02:24:41,750 --> 02:24:41,760
anarchism where we all have agreed
 

8381
02:24:41,760 --> 02:24:43,590
anarchism where we all have agreed
i haven't agreed to anything so like the

8382
02:24:43,590 --> 02:24:43,600
i haven't agreed to anything so like the
 

8383
02:24:43,600 --> 02:24:45,910
i haven't agreed to anything so like the
basic criticism you have is like you're

8384
02:24:45,910 --> 02:24:45,920
basic criticism you have is like you're
 

8385
02:24:45,920 --> 02:24:49,349
basic criticism you have is like you're
born on a land geographical land

8386
02:24:49,349 --> 02:24:49,359
born on a land geographical land
 

8387
02:24:49,359 --> 02:24:51,190
born on a land geographical land
geographical area

8388
02:24:51,190 --> 02:24:51,200
geographical area
 

8389
02:24:51,200 --> 02:24:53,670
geographical area
and you're forced to have signed a bunch

8390
02:24:53,670 --> 02:24:53,680
and you're forced to have signed a bunch
 

8391
02:24:53,680 --> 02:24:56,469
and you're forced to have signed a bunch
of stuff just by being born right a good

8392
02:24:56,469 --> 02:24:56,479
of stuff just by being born right a good
 

8393
02:24:56,479 --> 02:24:57,270
of stuff just by being born right a good
place

8394
02:24:57,270 --> 02:24:57,280
place
 

8395
02:24:57,280 --> 02:24:59,670
place
so

8396
02:24:59,670 --> 02:24:59,680

 

8397
02:24:59,680 --> 02:25:00,790

so really

8398
02:25:00,790 --> 02:25:00,800
so really
 

8399
02:25:00,800 --> 02:25:03,110
so really
you could if you could just much easier

8400
02:25:03,110 --> 02:25:03,120
you could if you could just much easier
 

8401
02:25:03,120 --> 02:25:06,550
you could if you could just much easier
choose right which space of ideas

8402
02:25:06,550 --> 02:25:06,560
choose right which space of ideas
 

8403
02:25:06,560 --> 02:25:08,870
choose right which space of ideas
you uh associated with right that would

8404
02:25:08,870 --> 02:25:08,880
you uh associated with right that would
 

8405
02:25:08,880 --> 02:25:13,110
you uh associated with right that would
be actually a state of anarchism yes

8406
02:25:13,110 --> 02:25:13,120

 

8407
02:25:13,120 --> 02:25:15,670

and you could have like a military that

8408
02:25:15,670 --> 02:25:15,680
and you could have like a military that
 

8409
02:25:15,680 --> 02:25:18,070
and you could have like a military that
you sign up with sure

8410
02:25:18,070 --> 02:25:18,080
you sign up with sure
 

8411

02:25:19,510 --> 02:25:19,520
and you're certainly not putting people
 

8413
02:25:19,520 --> 02:25:21,670
and you're certainly not putting people
in prison to get raped because they're

8414
02:25:21,670 --> 02:25:21,680
in prison to get raped because they're

well do you think there's a value of um

8732
02:30:42,870 --> 02:30:42,880
well do you think there's a value of um
 

8733
02:30:42,880 --> 02:30:45,590
well do you think there's a value of um
competing world views

8734
02:30:45,590 --> 02:30:45,600
competing world views
 

8735
02:30:45,600 --> 02:30:47,270

02:30:47,270 --> 02:30:47,280
being forced
 

8737
02:30:47,280 --> 02:30:49,270
being forced
to be in the same

8738
02:30:49,270 --> 02:30:49,280
to be in the same
 

8739
02:30:49,280 --> 02:30:52,150
to be in the same
yes within a context

8740
02:30:52,150 --> 02:30:52,160
yes within a context
 

8741
02:30:52,160 --> 02:30:55,590
yes within a context
so we can agree if group one

8742
02:30:55,590 --> 02:30:55,600
so we can agree if group one
 

8743
02:30:55,600 --> 02:30:57,590
so we can agree if group one
thinks a b and c are the fundamental

8744
02:30:57,590 --> 02:30:57,600
thinks a b and c are the fundamental
 

8745
02:30:57,600 --> 02:30:59,590
thinks a b and c are the fundamental
aspects of their world view and argue

8746
02:30:59,590 --> 02:30:59,600
aspects of their world view and argue
 

8747
02:30:59,600 --> 02:31:02,550
aspects of their world view and argue
within that and world group two thinks d

8748
02:31:02,550 --> 02:31:02,560
within that and world group two thinks d
 

8749
02:31:02,560 --> 02:31:04,950
within that and world group two thinks d
e and f and argue within that so you're

8750
02:31:04,950 --> 02:31:04,960
e and f and argue within that so you're
 

8751
02:31:04,960 --> 02:31:06,309
e and f and argue within that so you're
going to have a lot of argument within

8752
02:31:06,309 --> 02:31:06,319
going to have a lot of argument within
 

8753
02:31:06,319 --> 02:31:08,150
going to have a lot of argument within
those space but if there's fundamental

8754
02:31:08,150 --> 02:31:08,160
those space but if there's fundamental
 

8755
02:31:08,160 --> 02:31:10,790
those space but if there's fundamental
differences in world view there's

8756
02:31:10,790 --> 02:31:10,800
differences in world view there's
 

8757
02:31:10,800 --> 02:31:12,389
differences in world view there's
no reason to be

8758
02:31:12,389 --> 02:31:12,399
no reason to be

do you think there's a line

8764
02:31:18,550 --> 02:31:18,560
do you think there's a line
 

8765
02:31:18,560 --> 02:31:21,670
do you think there's a line
of fundamentally different world views

8766
02:31:21,670 --> 02:31:21,680
of fundamentally different world views
 

8767
02:31:21,680 --> 02:31:23,830
of fundamentally different world views
that uh

8768
02:31:23,830 --> 02:31:23,840
that uh
 

8769
02:31:23,840 --> 02:31:26,630
that uh

yeah so risk-averse and then there's
 

8811
02:32:07,600 --> 02:32:09,590
yeah so risk-averse and then there's
like a uh

02:33:02,309 --> 02:33:02,319
point on which to then highlight the
 

8863
02:33:02,319 --> 02:33:03,670
point on which to then highlight the
difference between

8864
02:33:03,670 --> 02:33:03,680
difference between
 

8865
02:33:03,680 --> 02:33:05,110

it it sounds kind of on the face kind of
 

8873
02:33:11,040 --> 02:33:12,550
it it sounds kind of on the face kind of
ridiculous that the secession would

8874
02:33:12,550 --> 02:33:12,560
ridiculous that the secession would
 

8875
02:33:12,560 --> 02:33:14,309
ridiculous that the secession would
occur over a mask it wouldn't but i'm

8876
02:33:14,309 --> 02:33:14,319
occur over a mask it wouldn't but i'm

of history so they thought trump was the

9024
02:35:43,990 --> 02:35:44,000
of history so they thought trump was the
 

9025
02:35:44,000 --> 02:35:46,469
of history so they thought trump was the
river but he was the dam

river but he was the dam
 

9027

the cathedral does it on a regular basis

9482
02:43:18,950 --> 02:43:18,960
the cathedral does it on a regular basis

02:43:23,910 --> 02:43:23,920
the the cathedral i guess you can maybe
 

9487
02:43:23,920 --> 02:43:25,510
the the cathedral i guess you can maybe
define the cathedral but it's it's like

9488
02:43:25,510 --> 02:43:25,520
define the cathedral but it's it's like
 

9489
02:43:25,520 --> 02:43:27,429
define the cathedral but it's it's like
the centralized institutions that have

9490
02:43:27,429 --> 02:43:27,439
the centralized institutions that have
 

9491
02:43:27,439 --> 02:43:29,030
the centralized institutions that have
like a story that they're trying to sell

9492
02:43:29,030 --> 02:43:29,040
like a story that they're trying to sell
 

9493
02:43:29,040 --> 02:43:30,550
like a story that they're trying to sell
and so this is moldbuck's concept but

9494
02:43:30,550 --> 02:43:30,560
and so this is moldbuck's concept but
 

9495
02:43:30,560 --> 02:43:32,469
and so this is moldbuck's concept but
yeah they basically are set the limits

9496
02:43:32,469 --> 02:43:32,479
yeah they basically are set the limits
 

9497
02:43:32,479 --> 02:43:33,910
yeah they basically are set the limits
of permissible discourse and create a

9498
02:43:33,910 --> 02:43:33,920
of permissible discourse and create a
 

9499
02:43:33,920 --> 02:43:35,750
of permissible discourse and create a
narrative for the population to follow

9500
02:43:35,750 --> 02:43:35,760
narrative for the population to follow
 

9501
02:43:35,760 --> 02:43:37,910
narrative for the population to follow
but to me that's a minority of people

9502
02:43:37,910 --> 02:43:37,920
but to me that's a minority of people
 

9503
02:43:37,920 --> 02:43:39,750
but to me that's a minority of people
minorities always controlling everything

9504
02:43:39,750 --> 02:43:39,760
minorities always controlling everything
 

9505
02:43:39,760 --> 02:43:41,670
minorities always controlling everything
in any country the vast majority of

9506
02:43:41,670 --> 02:43:41,680
in any country the vast majority of
 

9507
02:43:41,680 --> 02:43:43,030
in any country the vast majority of
masses have no thought yeah but

9508
02:43:43,030 --> 02:43:43,040
masses have no thought yeah but
 

9509
02:43:43,040 --> 02:43:45,110
masses have no thought yeah but
minorities can be overthrown and sure

9510
02:43:45,110 --> 02:43:45,120

02:43:49,110 --> 02:43:49,120
pro no no no that's
 

9515
02:43:49,120 --> 02:43:50,870
pro no no no that's
the what progress looks like is

9516
02:43:50,870 --> 02:43:50,880
the what progress looks like is
 

9517
02:43:50,880 --> 02:43:53,190
the what progress looks like is
ridiculous people take power yes and

9518
02:43:53,190 --> 02:43:53,200
ridiculous people take power yes and
 

9519
02:43:53,200 --> 02:43:55,990
ridiculous people take power yes and

9521
02:43:56,000 --> 02:43:57,830
then uh they get annoying and new
ridiculous people that are a little bit

9522
02:43:57,830 --> 02:43:57,840
ridiculous people that are a little bit
 

9523
02:43:57,840 --> 02:44:00,309
ridiculous people that are a little bit
better overthrow the previous no i think

9524
02:44:00,309 --> 02:44:00,319
better overthrow the previous no i think
 

9525
02:44:00,319 --> 02:44:02,309

people progress happens despite the

9526
02:44:02,309 --> 02:44:02,319
people progress happens despite the
 

9527
02:44:02,319 --> 02:44:03,750
people progress happens despite the
people who are in power not because of

9528
02:44:03,750 --> 02:44:03,760
people who are in power not because of
 

9529
02:44:03,760 --> 02:44:04,469
people who are in power not because of
them

9530
02:44:04,469 --> 02:44:04,479
them
 

9531
02:44:04,479 --> 02:44:08,710
them
right and so why is this secession

9532
02:44:08,710 --> 02:44:08,720

 

9533
02:44:08,720 --> 02:44:10,550

so is it always about overthrowing the

9534
02:44:10,550 --> 02:44:10,560
so is it always about overthrowing the
 

9535
02:44:10,560 --> 02:44:12,790
so is it always about overthrowing the
powerful is that how progress happens no

9536
02:44:12,790 --> 02:44:12,800
powerful is that how progress happens no
 

9537
02:44:12,800 --> 02:44:14,309
powerful is that how progress happens no
i think progress happens despite the

9538
02:44:14,309 --> 02:44:14,319
i think progress happens despite the
 

9539
02:44:14,319 --> 02:44:15,590
i think progress happens despite the
powerful the powerful are going to do

9540
02:44:15,590 --> 02:44:15,600
powerful the powerful are going to do
 

9541
02:44:15,600 --> 02:44:17,910
powerful the powerful are going to do
what's in their power to maintain their

what's in their power to maintain their
power and they're going to fight

9544
02:44:19,030 --> 02:44:19,040
power and they're going to fight
 

9545
02:44:19,040 --> 02:44:20,550
power and they're going to fight
innovation because it's a threat to

9546
02:44:20,550 --> 02:44:20,560
innovation because it's a threat to
 

9547
02:44:20,560 --> 02:44:22,710
innovation because it's a threat to
their control there's always going to be

9548
02:44:22,710 --> 02:44:22,720
their control there's always going to be
 

9549
02:44:22,720 --> 02:44:24,230
their control there's always going to be
the new york times of the world right

9550
02:44:24,230 --> 02:44:24,240
the new york times of the world right
 

9551
02:44:24,240 --> 02:44:25,990
the new york times of the world right
there's always going to be those those

9552
02:44:25,990 --> 02:44:26,000
there's always going to be those those
 

9553
02:44:26,000 --> 02:44:28,710
there's always going to be those those
that let them have their own country

9554
02:44:28,710 --> 02:44:28,720
that let them have their own country
 

9555
02:44:28,720 --> 02:44:30,710
that let them have their own country
so it's two countries one has joe rogan

9556
02:44:30,710 --> 02:44:30,720
so it's two countries one has joe rogan
 

9557
02:44:30,720 --> 02:44:32,870
so it's two countries one has joe rogan
the other one has the new york times

9558
02:44:32,870 --> 02:44:32,880
the other one has the new york times
 

9559
02:44:32,880 --> 02:44:34,309
the other one has the new york times
that's basically what's happening right

9560
02:44:34,309 --> 02:44:34,319
that's basically what's happening right
 

9561
02:44:34,319 --> 02:44:36,950
that's basically what's happening right
now it just geographically doesn't

9562
02:44:36,950 --> 02:44:36,960
now it just geographically doesn't
 

9563
02:44:36,960 --> 02:44:40,070
now it just geographically doesn't
map out very well but culturally yes

9564
02:44:40,070 --> 02:44:40,080
map out very well but culturally yes
 

9565
02:44:40,080 --> 02:44:41,590
map out very well but culturally yes
but that's just cultural stuff like

9566
02:44:41,590 --> 02:44:41,600
but that's just cultural stuff like
 

9567
02:44:41,600 --> 02:44:44,230
but that's just cultural stuff like
there's a layer of public discourse okay

9568
02:44:44,230 --> 02:44:44,240
there's a layer of public discourse okay
 

9569
02:44:44,240 --> 02:44:45,510
there's a layer of public discourse okay
i don't mean like that's what we're

9570
02:44:45,510 --> 02:44:45,520
i don't mean like that's what we're
 

9571
02:44:45,520 --> 02:44:47,429
i don't mean like that's what we're
operating under now but there's actually

9572
02:44:47,429 --> 02:44:47,439
operating under now but there's actually
 

9573
02:44:47,439 --> 02:44:49,429
operating under now but there's actually
like progress being made like roads

9574
02:44:49,429 --> 02:44:49,439
like progress being made like roads
 

9575
02:44:49,439 --> 02:44:52,230
like progress being made like roads
being built uh hospitals being run all

9576
02:44:52,230 --> 02:44:52,240
being built uh hospitals being run all
 

9577
02:44:52,240 --> 02:44:53,750
being built uh hospitals being run all
those kinds of things like

9578
02:44:53,750 --> 02:44:53,760
those kinds of things like
 

9579
02:44:53,760 --> 02:44:56,150
those kinds of things like
different innovations that seems like

9580
02:44:56,150 --> 02:44:56,160
different innovations that seems like
 

9581
02:44:56,160 --> 02:44:59,030
different innovations that seems like
secession is counter productive to that

9582
02:44:59,030 --> 02:44:59,040
secession is counter productive to that
 

9583
02:44:59,040 --> 02:45:00,230
secession is counter productive to that
right because one country would have all

9584
02:45:00,230 --> 02:45:00,240
right because one country would have all
 

9585
02:45:00,240 --> 02:45:01,269
right because one country would have all
the roads and the other would have all

9586
02:45:01,269 --> 02:45:01,279
the roads and the other would have all
 

9587
02:45:01,279 --> 02:45:03,110
the roads and the other would have all
the hospitals that's that's a great

9588
02:45:03,110 --> 02:45:03,120
the hospitals that's that's a great
 

9589
02:45:03,120 --> 02:45:04,790
the hospitals that's that's a great
point no it's not that's not the point

9590
02:45:04,790 --> 02:45:04,800
point no it's not that's not the point
 

9591
02:45:04,800 --> 02:45:06,630
point no it's not that's not the point
i'm trying to make it's just like

9592
02:45:06,630 --> 02:45:06,640
i'm trying to make it's just like
 

9593
02:45:06,640 --> 02:45:08,710
i'm trying to make it's just like
it just feels like the division that

9594
02:45:08,710 --> 02:45:08,720
it just feels like the division that
 

9595
02:45:08,720 --> 02:45:11,750
it just feels like the division that
we're experiencing in the space of ideas

9596
02:45:11,750 --> 02:45:11,760
we're experiencing in the space of ideas
 

9597
02:45:11,760 --> 02:45:15,510
we're experiencing in the space of ideas
could be constructive and productive for

9598
02:45:15,510 --> 02:45:15,520
could be constructive and productive for
 

9599
02:45:15,520 --> 02:45:16,870
could be constructive and productive for
for building better roads and better

9600
02:45:16,870 --> 02:45:16,880
for building better roads and better
 

9601
02:45:16,880 --> 02:45:19,590
for building better roads and better
hospitals as opposed to like

9602
02:45:19,590 --> 02:45:19,600
hospitals as opposed to like
 

9603
02:45:19,600 --> 02:45:20,950
hospitals as opposed to like
using that division to separate the

9604
02:45:20,950 --> 02:45:20,960
using that division to separate the
 

9605
02:45:20,960 --> 02:45:22,309
using that division to separate the
countries they're all gonna have to

9606
02:45:22,309 --> 02:45:22,319
countries they're all gonna have to
 

9607
02:45:22,319 --> 02:45:25,510
countries they're all gonna have to
solve the same problems it feels like

9608
02:45:25,510 --> 02:45:25,520
solve the same problems it feels like
 

9609
02:45:25,520 --> 02:45:27,510
solve the same problems it feels like
sure but they can solve them differently

9610
02:45:27,510 --> 02:45:27,520
sure but they can solve them differently
 

9611
02:45:27,520 --> 02:45:29,510
sure but they can solve them differently
and compete that way massively a great

9612
02:45:29,510 --> 02:45:29,520
and compete that way massively a great
 

9613
02:45:29,520 --> 02:45:31,510
and compete that way massively a great
example yeah now we're seeing that right

9614
02:45:31,510 --> 02:45:31,520
example yeah now we're seeing that right
 

9615
02:45:31,520 --> 02:45:32,550
example yeah now we're seeing that right
now different countries have different

9616
02:45:32,550 --> 02:45:32,560
now different countries have different
 

9617
02:45:32,560 --> 02:45:34,550
now different countries have different
mass mandates and things like this and

9618
02:45:34,550 --> 02:45:34,560
mass mandates and things like this and
 

9619
02:45:34,560 --> 02:45:37,190
mass mandates and things like this and
uh the competition within the same

9620
02:45:37,190 --> 02:45:37,200
uh the competition within the same
 

9621
02:45:37,200 --> 02:45:38,870
uh the competition within the same
structure with the same founding

9622
02:45:38,870 --> 02:45:38,880
structure with the same founding
 

9623
02:45:38,880 --> 02:45:40,790
structure with the same founding
documents and same institutions is not

9624
02:45:40,790 --> 02:45:40,800
documents and same institutions is not
 

9625
02:45:40,800 --> 02:45:42,950
documents and same institutions is not
effective you think is as effective as

9626
02:45:42,950 --> 02:45:42,960
effective you think is as effective as
 

9627
02:45:42,960 --> 02:45:45,030
effective you think is as effective as
separating it is effective but there is

9628
02:45:45,030 --> 02:45:45,040
separating it is effective but there is
 

9629
02:45:45,040 --> 02:45:46,389
separating it is effective but there is
a certain point which i think we have

9630
02:45:46,389 --> 02:45:46,399
a certain point which i think we have
 

9631
02:45:46,399 --> 02:45:47,750
a certain point which i think we have
long past

9632
02:45:47,750 --> 02:45:47,760
long past
 

9633
02:45:47,760 --> 02:45:49,670
long past

culturally let me ask you a fun question
okay knock

9640
02:45:54,830 --> 02:45:54,840
okay knock

mars

9644
02:46:01,590 --> 02:46:01,600
mars
 

9645
02:46:01,600 --> 02:46:03,349
mars
god of war

9646
02:46:03,349 --> 02:46:03,359
god of war
 

9647
02:46:03,359 --> 02:46:05,910
god of war
the other one

9648
02:46:05,910 --> 02:46:05,920
the other one
 

9649
02:46:05,920 --> 02:46:08,630
the other one
the planet yeah

9650
02:46:08,630 --> 02:46:08,640
the planet yeah
 

9651
02:46:08,640 --> 02:46:11,110
the planet yeah
so there is a kind of

9652
02:46:11,110 --> 02:46:11,120
so there is a kind of
 

9653
02:46:11,120 --> 02:46:14,309
so there is a kind of
captivating notion that we might

9654
02:46:14,309 --> 02:46:14,319
captivating notion that we might
 

9655
02:46:14,319 --> 02:46:16,950
captivating notion that we might
i'm i'm excited by it the

9656
02:46:16,950 --> 02:46:16,960
i'm i'm excited by it the
 

9657
02:46:16,960 --> 02:46:19,269
i'm i'm excited by it the
human being stepping foot on mars

9658
02:46:19,269 --> 02:46:19,279
human being stepping foot on mars
 

9659
02:46:19,279 --> 02:46:21,590
human being stepping foot on mars
that to me is uh

9660
02:46:21,590 --> 02:46:21,600
that to me is uh
 

9661
02:46:21,600 --> 02:46:25,349
that to me is uh
it's like one of those things that feels

9662
02:46:25,349 --> 02:46:25,359
it's like one of those things that feels
 

9663
02:46:25,359 --> 02:46:26,630
it's like one of those things that feels
like it's

9664
02:46:26,630 --> 02:46:26,640
like it's
 

9665
02:46:26,640 --> 02:46:29,990
like it's
why do we want to

9666
02:46:29,990 --> 02:46:30,000
why do we want to
 

9667
02:46:30,000 --> 02:46:32,630
why do we want to
engage in space exploration

9668
02:46:32,630 --> 02:46:32,640
engage in space exploration
 

9669
02:46:32,640 --> 02:46:34,950
engage in space exploration
but i'm a bit with the elon musk on this

9670
02:46:34,950 --> 02:46:34,960
but i'm a bit with the elon musk on this
 

9671
02:46:34,960 --> 02:46:37,269
but i'm a bit with the elon musk on this
which is um

9672
02:46:37,269 --> 02:46:37,279
which is um
 

9673
02:46:37,279 --> 02:46:39,990
which is um
it's obvious that eventually if human

9674
02:46:39,990 --> 02:46:40,000
it's obvious that eventually if human
 

9675
02:46:40,000 --> 02:46:42,070
it's obvious that eventually if human
species has to survive

9676
02:46:42,070 --> 02:46:42,080
species has to survive
 

9677
02:46:42,080 --> 02:46:45,030
species has to survive
it's going to have to innovate in ways

9678
02:46:45,030 --> 02:46:45,040
it's going to have to innovate in ways
 

9679
02:46:45,040 --> 02:46:47,590
it's going to have to innovate in ways
that includes the sp space okay

9680
02:46:47,590 --> 02:46:47,600
that includes the sp space okay
 

9681
02:46:47,600 --> 02:46:49,349
that includes the sp space okay
like there's a lot of things we're not

9682
02:46:49,349 --> 02:46:49,359
like there's a lot of things we're not
 

9683
02:46:49,359 --> 02:46:51,349
like there's a lot of things we're not
able to predict yet that

9684
02:46:51,349 --> 02:46:51,359
able to predict yet that
 

9685
02:46:51,359 --> 02:46:54,389
able to predict yet that
if we push ourselves to the limits of

9686
02:46:54,389 --> 02:46:54,399
if we push ourselves to the limits of
 

9687
02:46:54,399 --> 02:46:57,030
if we push ourselves to the limits of
space like new ideas will come they'll

9688
02:46:57,030 --> 02:46:57,040
space like new ideas will come they'll
 

9689
02:46:57,040 --> 02:46:59,110
space like new ideas will come they'll
be obvious a hundred years from now and

9690
02:46:59,110 --> 02:46:59,120
be obvious a hundred years from now and
 

9691
02:46:59,120 --> 02:47:01,269
be obvious a hundred years from now and
then we're not even imagining now

9692
02:47:01,269 --> 02:47:01,279
then we're not even imagining now
 

9693
02:47:01,279 --> 02:47:03,190
then we're not even imagining now
and colonizing mars

9694
02:47:03,190 --> 02:47:03,200
and colonizing mars
 

9695
02:47:03,200 --> 02:47:05,030
and colonizing mars
that idea that seems ridiculous

9696
02:47:05,030 --> 02:47:05,040
that idea that seems ridiculous
 

9697
02:47:05,040 --> 02:47:06,469
that idea that seems ridiculous
exceptionally difficult

9698
02:47:06,469 --> 02:47:06,479
exceptionally difficult
 

9699
02:47:06,479 --> 02:47:08,870
exceptionally difficult
impossibly expensive

9700
02:47:08,870 --> 02:47:08,880
impossibly expensive
 

9701
02:47:08,880 --> 02:47:11,510
impossibly expensive
is something that is actually going to

9702
02:47:11,510 --> 02:47:11,520
is something that is actually going to
 

9703
02:47:11,520 --> 02:47:13,750
is something that is actually going to
be seen as obvious in retrospect okay

9704
02:47:13,750 --> 02:47:13,760
be seen as obvious in retrospect okay
 

9705
02:47:13,760 --> 02:47:16,150
be seen as obvious in retrospect okay
and that we should engage in okay that's

9706
02:47:16,150 --> 02:47:16,160
and that we should engage in okay that's
 

9707
02:47:16,160 --> 02:47:18,309
and that we should engage in okay that's
just to contextualize things

9708
02:47:18,309 --> 02:47:18,319
just to contextualize things
 

9709
02:47:18,319 --> 02:47:21,510
just to contextualize things
the fun idea idea and experiment from a

9710
02:47:21,510 --> 02:47:21,520
the fun idea idea and experiment from a
 

9711
02:47:21,520 --> 02:47:23,910
the fun idea idea and experiment from a
philosophical and political sense is

9712
02:47:23,910 --> 02:47:23,920
philosophical and political sense is
 

9713
02:47:23,920 --> 02:47:27,110
philosophical and political sense is
what kind of government

9714
02:47:27,110 --> 02:47:27,120
what kind of government
 

9715
02:47:27,120 --> 02:47:29,590
what kind of government
how do you orchestrate a government when

9716
02:47:29,590 --> 02:47:29,600
how do you orchestrate a government when
 

9717
02:47:29,600 --> 02:47:31,349
how do you orchestrate a government when
you go to mars like

9718
02:47:31,349 --> 02:47:31,359
you go to mars like
 

9719
02:47:31,359 --> 02:47:33,190
you go to mars like
we don't get too many chances like this

9720
02:47:33,190 --> 02:47:33,200
we don't get too many chances like this
 

9721
02:47:33,200 --> 02:47:35,670
we don't get too many chances like this
but how do you build

9722
02:47:35,670 --> 02:47:35,680
but how do you build
 

9723
02:47:35,680 --> 02:47:37,030
but how do you build
new systems

9724
02:47:37,030 --> 02:47:37,040
new systems
 

9725
02:47:37,040 --> 02:47:39,190
new systems
not in place of old ones but in a place

9726
02:47:39,190 --> 02:47:39,200
not in place of old ones but in a place
 

9727
02:47:39,200 --> 02:47:41,590
not in place of old ones but in a place
where no system previously have existed

9728
02:47:41,590 --> 02:47:41,600
where no system previously have existed
 

9729
02:47:41,600 --> 02:47:43,590
where no system previously have existed

uh the way i heard it explained to me
 

10085
02:53:28,640 --> 02:53:31,030
uh the way i heard it explained to me
is that much of the human mind isn't

10086
02:53:31,030 --> 02:53:31,040
is that much of the human mind isn't

10091
02:53:34,080 --> 02:53:36,550
receiving information but blocking
information right because we're so

10092
02:53:36,550 --> 02:53:36,560
information right because we're so
 

10093
02:53:36,560 --> 02:53:37,910
information right because we're so
there's so much data coming in any

10094
02:53:37,910 --> 02:53:37,920
there's so much data coming in any
 

10095
02:53:37,920 --> 02:53:39,590
there's so much data coming in any
moment that you basically have to train

10096
02:53:39,590 --> 02:53:39,600
moment that you basically have to train
 

10097
02:53:39,600 --> 02:53:40,950
moment that you basically have to train
yourself to see and to hear only what

10098
02:53:40,950 --> 02:53:40,960
yourself to see and to hear only what
 

10099
02:53:40,960 --> 02:53:43,030
yourself to see and to hear only what
you want to see into here and then what

10100
02:53:43,030 --> 02:53:43,040
you want to see into here and then what
 

10101
02:53:43,040 --> 02:53:45,190
you want to see into here and then what
psychedelics do is they tear that away

10102
02:53:45,190 --> 02:53:45,200
psychedelics do is they tear that away
 

10103
02:53:45,200 --> 02:53:46,469
psychedelics do is they tear that away
and suddenly you're much more aware of

10104
02:53:46,469 --> 02:53:46,479
and suddenly you're much more aware of
 

10105
02:53:46,479 --> 02:53:47,590
and suddenly you're much more aware of
what's out there and also you're going

10106
02:53:47,590 --> 02:53:47,600
what's out there and also you're going
 

10107
02:53:47,600 --> 02:53:48,870
what's out there and also you're going
to be noticing patterns that you hadn't

10108
02:53:48,870 --> 02:53:48,880
to be noticing patterns that you hadn't
 

10109
02:53:48,880 --> 02:53:50,389
to be noticing patterns that you hadn't
noticed before i know you had that

10110
02:53:50,389 --> 02:53:50,399
noticed before i know you had that
 

10111

researcher on the show and he kind of
discussed this at some length

10114
02:53:54,230 --> 02:53:54,240
discussed this at some length

know anyone
who has even the researchers who have

10128
02:54:07,349 --> 02:54:07,359
who has even the researchers who have
 

10129
02:54:07,359 --> 02:54:10,230
who has even the researchers who have
anything close to a coherent explanation

10130
02:54:10,230 --> 02:54:10,240
anything close to a coherent explanation
 

10131
02:54:10,240 --> 02:54:11,349
anything close to a coherent explanation
of why

10132
02:54:11,349 --> 02:54:11,359
of why
 

10133
02:54:11,359 --> 02:54:12,550
of why
this drug

10134
02:54:12,550 --> 02:54:12,560
this drug
 

10135
02:54:12,560 --> 02:54:14,230
this drug
which exists everywhere would have this

10136
02:54:14,230 --> 02:54:14,240
which exists everywhere would have this
 

10137
02:54:14,240 --> 02:54:17,110
which exists everywhere would have this
very specific very extreme effect on so

10138
02:54:17,110 --> 02:54:17,120
very specific very extreme effect on so
 

10139
02:54:17,120 --> 02:54:19,030
very specific very extreme effect on so
many people who are going to be

10140
02:54:19,030 --> 02:54:19,040
many people who are going to be
 

10141
02:54:19,040 --> 02:54:21,349
many people who are going to be
experiencing such bizarre consequences

10142
02:54:21,349 --> 02:54:21,359
experiencing such bizarre consequences
 

10143
02:54:21,359 --> 02:54:22,950
experiencing such bizarre consequences
as a result of it

10144
02:54:22,950 --> 02:54:22,960
as a result of it
 

10145
02:54:22,960 --> 02:54:25,110
as a result of it
i think it's very interesting that this

10146
02:54:25,110 --> 02:54:25,120
i think it's very interesting that this
 

10147
02:54:25,120 --> 02:54:26,309
i think it's very interesting that this
is talking with the government this you

suicide
 

10157
02:54:33,040 --> 02:54:35,670
suicide
and there was a lot of research into

10158
02:54:35,670 --> 02:54:35,680
and there was a lot of research into
 

10159
02:54:35,680 --> 02:54:37,429
and there was a lot of research into
terrence mckenna talks about this

10160
02:54:37,429 --> 02:54:37,439
terrence mckenna talks about this
 

10161
02:54:37,439 --> 02:54:38,230
terrence mckenna talks about this
um

10162
02:54:38,230 --> 02:54:38,240
um
 

10163
02:54:38,240 --> 02:54:40,630
um
into this field and then very quickly

10164
02:54:40,630 --> 02:54:40,640
into this field and then very quickly
 

10165
02:54:40,640 --> 02:54:42,309
into this field and then very quickly
once they got into the mainstream they

10166
02:54:42,309 --> 02:54:42,319
once they got into the mainstream they
 

10167
02:54:42,319 --> 02:54:43,429
once they got into the mainstream they
shut it down

10168
02:54:43,429 --> 02:54:43,439
shut it down
 

10169
02:54:43,439 --> 02:54:44,630
shut it down
even though it's not addictive it

10170
02:54:44,630 --> 02:54:44,640
even though it's not addictive it
 

10171
02:54:44,640 --> 02:54:45,990
even though it's not addictive it
doesn't cause you to go crazy or

10172
02:54:45,990 --> 02:54:46,000
doesn't cause you to go crazy or
 

10173
02:54:46,000 --> 02:54:47,510
doesn't cause you to go crazy or
anything like that and there was a lot

10174
02:54:47,510 --> 02:54:47,520
anything like that and there was a lot
 

10175
02:54:47,520 --> 02:54:50,070
anything like that and there was a lot
of propaganda against its use which i

10176
02:54:50,070 --> 02:54:50,080
of propaganda against its use which i
 

10177
02:54:50,080 --> 02:54:51,590
of propaganda against its use which i
think thankfully is now somewhat

10178
02:54:51,590 --> 02:54:51,600
think thankfully is now somewhat
 

10179
02:54:51,600 --> 02:54:53,510
think thankfully is now somewhat
receding i think in colorado just

10180
02:54:53,510 --> 02:54:53,520
receding i think in colorado just
 

10181
02:54:53,520 --> 02:54:55,510
receding i think in colorado just
legalized mushrooms something like that

10182
02:54:55,510 --> 02:54:55,520
legalized mushrooms something like that
 

10183
02:54:55,520 --> 02:54:56,630
legalized mushrooms something like that
and i think it'll be very interesting to

10184
02:54:56,630 --> 02:54:56,640
and i think it'll be very interesting to
 

10185
02:54:56,640 --> 02:54:58,630
and i think it'll be very interesting to
see what happens as a result of this

10186
02:54:58,630 --> 02:54:58,640
see what happens as a result of this
 

10187
02:54:58,640 --> 02:55:00,790
see what happens as a result of this
yeah and the interesting thing is there

10188
02:55:00,790 --> 02:55:00,800
yeah and the interesting thing is there
 

10189
02:55:00,800 --> 02:55:02,710
yeah and the interesting thing is there
doesn't seem to be for certain

10190

10195
02:55:06,479 --> 02:55:08,150
mushrooms there doesn't seem to be a
lethal dose

10196
02:55:08,150 --> 02:55:08,160
lethal dose
 

10197
02:55:08,160 --> 02:55:09,190
lethal dose
which is

10198
02:55:09,190 --> 02:55:09,200
which is
