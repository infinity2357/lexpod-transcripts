um we can exchange those things directly
with one another but as

166
00:02:58,710 --> 00:02:58,720
with one another but as
 

167
00:02:58,720 --> 00:03:00,229
with one another but as
you know if we get

168
00:03:00,229 --> 00:03:00,239
you know if we get
 

169
00:03:00,239 --> 00:03:01,830
you know if we get
in contact with other

170
00:03:01,830 --> 00:03:01,840
in contact with other
 

171
00:03:01,840 --> 00:03:04,550
in contact with other
societies that have more people then the

172
00:03:04,550 --> 00:03:04,560
societies that have more people then the
 

173
00:03:04,560 --> 00:03:06,149
societies that have more people then the
opportunities for specialization

174
00:03:06,149 --> 00:03:06,159
opportunities for specialization
 

175
00:03:06,159 --> 00:03:07,589
opportunities for specialization
increase you know if there's 10 people

176
00:03:07,589 --> 00:03:07,599
increase you know if there's 10 people
 

177
00:03:07,599 --> 00:03:09,830
increase you know if there's 10 people
the only thing that you can make is

178
00:03:09,830 --> 00:03:09,840
the only thing that you can make is
 

179
00:03:09,840 --> 00:03:11,430
the only thing that you can make is
the very basics you need for your

180
00:03:11,430 --> 00:03:11,440
the very basics you need for your
 

181
00:03:11,440 --> 00:03:13,110
the very basics you need for your
survival but if you're part of an

182
00:03:13,110 --> 00:03:13,120
survival but if you're part of an
 

183
00:03:13,120 --> 00:03:14,470
survival but if you're part of an
economy of 10

184
00:03:14,470 --> 00:03:14,480
economy of 10
 

185
00:03:14,480 --> 00:03:16,390
economy of 10
million people there's much more room

186
00:03:16,390 --> 00:03:16,400
million people there's much more room
 

187
00:03:16,400 --> 00:03:18,390
million people there's much more room
for specialization you can make a car

188
00:03:18,390 --> 00:03:18,400
for specialization you can make a car
 

189
00:03:18,400 --> 00:03:20,710
for specialization you can make a car
you can make a house that's very

190
00:03:20,710 --> 00:03:20,720
you can make a house that's very
 

191
00:03:20,720 --> 00:03:23,589
you can make a house that's very
sophisticated and that relies on the

192
00:03:23,589 --> 00:03:23,599
sophisticated and that relies on the
 

193
00:03:23,599 --> 00:03:25,910
sophisticated and that relies on the
division of labor that relies on you

194
00:03:25,910 --> 00:03:25,920
division of labor that relies on you
 

195
00:03:25,920 --> 00:03:27,990
division of labor that relies on you
specializing in doing one tiny little

196
00:03:27,990 --> 00:03:28,000
specializing in doing one tiny little
 

197
00:03:28,000 --> 00:03:28,869
specializing in doing one tiny little
thing

198
00:03:28,869 --> 00:03:28,879
thing
 

199
00:03:28,879 --> 00:03:30,869
thing
which is not what you consume you know

200
00:03:30,869 --> 00:03:30,879
which is not what you consume you know
 

201
00:03:30,879 --> 00:03:33,509
which is not what you consume you know
you can and you trade that thing for all

202
00:03:33,509 --> 00:03:33,519
you can and you trade that thing for all
 

203
00:03:33,519 --> 00:03:35,350
you can and you trade that thing for all
the things that you consume so

204
00:03:35,350 --> 00:03:35,360
the things that you consume so
 

205
00:03:35,360 --> 00:03:36,710
the things that you consume so
as the economy becomes more

206
00:03:36,710 --> 00:03:36,720
as the economy becomes more
 

207
00:03:36,720 --> 00:03:38,789
as the economy becomes more
sophisticated and involves more people

208
00:03:38,789 --> 00:03:38,799
sophisticated and involves more people
 

209
00:03:38,799 --> 00:03:40,710
sophisticated and involves more people
and currently we're all part of a of an

210
00:03:40,710 --> 00:03:40,720
and currently we're all part of a of an
 

211
00:03:40,720 --> 00:03:43,190
and currently we're all part of a of an
economy of almost eight billion people

212
00:03:43,190 --> 00:03:43,200
economy of almost eight billion people
 

213
00:03:43,200 --> 00:03:45,589
economy of almost eight billion people
um each one of us produces one tiny

214
00:03:45,589 --> 00:03:45,599
um each one of us produces one tiny
 

215
00:03:45,599 --> 00:03:48,070
um each one of us produces one tiny
little thing and they exchange that

216
00:03:48,070 --> 00:03:48,080
little thing and they exchange that
 

217
00:03:48,080 --> 00:03:48,869
little thing and they exchange that
thing

218
00:03:48,869 --> 00:03:48,879
thing
 

219
00:03:48,879 --> 00:03:51,270
thing
for all the things that they want and so

220
00:03:51,270 --> 00:03:51,280
for all the things that they want and so
 

221
00:03:51,280 --> 00:03:52,869
for all the things that they want and so
because we specialize we become more

222
00:03:52,869 --> 00:03:52,879
because we specialize we become more
 

223
00:03:52,879 --> 00:03:54,470
because we specialize we become more
productive in doing the thing that we're

224
00:03:54,470 --> 00:03:54,480
productive in doing the thing that we're
 

225
00:03:54,480 --> 00:03:55,429
productive in doing the thing that we're
good at

226
00:03:55,429 --> 00:03:55,439
good at
 

227
00:03:55,439 --> 00:03:57,190
good at
so you know there's people out there who

228
00:03:57,190 --> 00:03:57,200
so you know there's people out there who
 

229
00:03:57,200 --> 00:03:58,630
so you know there's people out there who
are engineers who are designing

230
00:03:58,630 --> 00:03:58,640
are engineers who are designing
 

231
00:03:58,640 --> 00:04:00,390
are engineers who are designing
windshields and cars it's a very

232
00:04:00,390 --> 00:04:00,400
windshields and cars it's a very
 

233
00:04:00,400 --> 00:04:02,710
windshields and cars it's a very
specialized thing they sell windshield

234
00:04:02,710 --> 00:04:02,720
specialized thing they sell windshield
 

235
00:04:02,720 --> 00:04:05,110
specialized thing they sell windshield
design to mercedes-benz

236
00:04:05,110 --> 00:04:05,120
design to mercedes-benz
 

237
00:04:05,120 --> 00:04:07,509
design to mercedes-benz
and then from that you know that

238
00:04:07,509 --> 00:04:07,519
and then from that you know that
 

239
00:04:07,519 --> 00:04:09,030
and then from that you know that
windshield design is

240
00:04:09,030 --> 00:04:09,040
windshield design is
 

241
00:04:09,040 --> 00:04:10,710
windshield design is
added on to millions of cars around the

242
00:04:10,710 --> 00:04:10,720
added on to millions of cars around the
 

243
00:04:10,720 --> 00:04:13,429
added on to millions of cars around the
world and from that they're able to get

244
00:04:13,429 --> 00:04:13,439
world and from that they're able to get
 

245
00:04:13,439 --> 00:04:15,830
world and from that they're able to get
enough money to meet all of their needs

246
00:04:15,830 --> 00:04:15,840
enough money to meet all of their needs
 

247
00:04:15,840 --> 00:04:17,830
enough money to meet all of their needs
so the division of labor is enhanced

248
00:04:17,830 --> 00:04:17,840
so the division of labor is enhanced
 

249
00:04:17,840 --> 00:04:19,909
so the division of labor is enhanced
enormously with money because without

250
00:04:19,909 --> 00:04:19,919
enormously with money because without
 

251
00:04:19,919 --> 00:04:22,230
enormously with money because without
money it's very difficult to be able to

252
00:04:22,230 --> 00:04:22,240
money it's very difficult to be able to
 

253
00:04:22,240 --> 00:04:23,510
money it's very difficult to be able to
exchange

254
00:04:23,510 --> 00:04:23,520
exchange
 

255
00:04:23,520 --> 00:04:25,030
exchange
a large number of goods it's very

256
00:04:25,030 --> 00:04:25,040
a large number of goods it's very
 

257
00:04:25,040 --> 00:04:26,310
a large number of goods it's very
difficult to have a sophisticated

258
00:04:26,310 --> 00:04:26,320
difficult to have a sophisticated
 

259
00:04:26,320 --> 00:04:28,310
difficult to have a sophisticated
economy with a large degree of

260
00:04:28,310 --> 00:04:28,320
economy with a large degree of
 

261
00:04:28,320 --> 00:04:30,870
economy with a large degree of
specialization because

262
00:04:30,870 --> 00:04:30,880
specialization because
 

263
00:04:30,880 --> 00:04:33,749
specialization because
it's very difficult to find people who

264
00:04:33,749 --> 00:04:33,759
it's very difficult to find people who
 

265
00:04:33,759 --> 00:04:36,230
it's very difficult to find people who
want the thing that you have and have

266
00:04:36,230 --> 00:04:36,240
want the thing that you have and have
 

267
00:04:36,240 --> 00:04:38,469
want the thing that you have and have
the thing that you want we call this the

268
00:04:38,469 --> 00:04:38,479
the thing that you want we call this the
 

269
00:04:38,479 --> 00:04:40,550
the thing that you want we call this the
coincidence of wants

270
00:04:40,550 --> 00:04:40,560
coincidence of wants
 

271
00:04:40,560 --> 00:04:42,230
coincidence of wants
and that's really the problem that money

272
00:04:42,230 --> 00:04:42,240
and that's really the problem that money
 

273
00:04:42,240 --> 00:04:45,350
and that's really the problem that money
solves so you make apples and i make

274
00:04:45,350 --> 00:04:45,360
solves so you make apples and i make
 

275
00:04:45,360 --> 00:04:46,629
solves so you make apples and i make
oranges

276
00:04:46,629 --> 00:04:46,639
oranges
 

277
00:04:46,639 --> 00:04:48,390
oranges
i'd like to have some of your apples but

278
00:04:48,390 --> 00:04:48,400
i'd like to have some of your apples but
 

279
00:04:48,400 --> 00:04:50,790
i'd like to have some of your apples but
you don't want my oranges that's we have

280
00:04:50,790 --> 00:04:50,800
you don't want my oranges that's we have
 

281
00:04:50,800 --> 00:04:52,310
you don't want my oranges that's we have
a problem of coincidence of one so what

282
00:04:52,310 --> 00:04:52,320
a problem of coincidence of one so what
 

283
00:04:52,320 --> 00:04:54,550
a problem of coincidence of one so what
do i do you want bananas i need to find

284
00:04:54,550 --> 00:04:54,560
do i do you want bananas i need to find
 

285
00:04:54,560 --> 00:04:56,710
do i do you want bananas i need to find
somebody who has bananas give them my

286
00:04:56,710 --> 00:04:56,720
somebody who has bananas give them my
 

287
00:04:56,720 --> 00:04:58,469
somebody who has bananas give them my
oranges take their bananas give you

288
00:04:58,469 --> 00:04:58,479
oranges take their bananas give you
 

289
00:04:58,479 --> 00:05:00,710
oranges take their bananas give you
their bananas and then i take the apples

290
00:05:00,710 --> 00:05:00,720
their bananas and then i take the apples
 

291
00:05:00,720 --> 00:05:02,310
their bananas and then i take the apples
in that case bananas are a medium of

292
00:05:02,310 --> 00:05:02,320
in that case bananas are a medium of
 

293
00:05:02,320 --> 00:05:03,350
in that case bananas are a medium of
exchange

294
00:05:03,350 --> 00:05:03,360
exchange
 

295
00:05:03,360 --> 00:05:05,189
exchange
so it's natural that a medium exchange

296
00:05:05,189 --> 00:05:05,199
so it's natural that a medium exchange
 

297
00:05:05,199 --> 00:05:07,270
so it's natural that a medium exchange
will evolve and will emerge in an

298
00:05:07,270 --> 00:05:07,280
will evolve and will emerge in an
 

299
00:05:07,280 --> 00:05:08,790
will evolve and will emerge in an
economy as an economy becomes more

300
00:05:08,790 --> 00:05:08,800
economy as an economy becomes more
 

301
00:05:08,800 --> 00:05:11,189
economy as an economy becomes more
sophisticated as we move beyond

302
00:05:11,189 --> 00:05:11,199
sophisticated as we move beyond
 

303
00:05:11,199 --> 00:05:13,590
sophisticated as we move beyond
10 people and 10 goods it's inevitable

304
00:05:13,590 --> 00:05:13,600
10 people and 10 goods it's inevitable
 

305
00:05:13,600 --> 00:05:15,590
10 people and 10 goods it's inevitable
that we're going to come to a situation

306
00:05:15,590 --> 00:05:15,600
that we're going to come to a situation
 

307
00:05:15,600 --> 00:05:17,189
that we're going to come to a situation
where we have the problem of coincidence

308
00:05:17,189 --> 00:05:17,199
where we have the problem of coincidence
 

309
00:05:17,199 --> 00:05:18,390
where we have the problem of coincidence
of wants

310
00:05:18,390 --> 00:05:18,400
of wants
 

311
00:05:18,400 --> 00:05:20,790
of wants
and the way to solve that is to use a

312
00:05:20,790 --> 00:05:20,800
and the way to solve that is to use a
 

313
00:05:20,800 --> 00:05:21,990
and the way to solve that is to use a
medium of exchange and it can be

314
00:05:21,990 --> 00:05:22,000
medium of exchange and it can be
 

315
00:05:22,000 --> 00:05:24,790
medium of exchange and it can be
anything it can be a banana it can be

316
00:05:24,790 --> 00:05:24,800
anything it can be a banana it can be
 

317
00:05:24,800 --> 00:05:28,070
anything it can be a banana it can be
food stuff it can be any kind of good

318
00:05:28,070 --> 00:05:28,080
food stuff it can be any kind of good
 

319
00:05:28,080 --> 00:05:30,150
food stuff it can be any kind of good
as long as i acquire the good with the

320
00:05:30,150 --> 00:05:30,160
as long as i acquire the good with the
 

321
00:05:30,160 --> 00:05:32,629
as long as i acquire the good with the
purpose of it passing it on to you not

322
00:05:32,629 --> 00:05:32,639
purpose of it passing it on to you not
 

323
00:05:32,639 --> 00:05:34,230
purpose of it passing it on to you not
for the purpose of me consuming it or

324
00:05:34,230 --> 00:05:34,240
for the purpose of me consuming it or
 

325
00:05:34,240 --> 00:05:36,230
for the purpose of me consuming it or
using it then that's a medium of

326
00:05:36,230 --> 00:05:36,240
using it then that's a medium of
 

327

the term coincidence of wants so each
 

339
00:05:49,759 --> 00:05:51,590
the term coincidence of wants so each
one of them it's like a stochastic

us to
 

437
00:07:33,280 --> 00:07:35,430
us to
develop tools that we can use for

00:07:35,430 --> 00:07:35,440
develop tools that we can use for
 

439
00:07:35,440 --> 00:07:37,749
develop tools that we can use for
production and um that's what we do

production and um that's what we do
 

441
00:07:37,759 --> 00:07:39,189

that's what humans have been doing since

powerful money money is what allows it
 

469
00:08:03,840 --> 00:08:05,990
powerful money money is what allows it
to scale really money is what allows it

again as i was saying earlier you know

480
00:08:14,869 --> 00:08:14,879
again as i was saying earlier you know
 

481
00:08:14,879 --> 00:08:16,150
again as i was saying earlier you know
all you need to do is specialize in

482
00:08:16,150 --> 00:08:16,160
all you need to do is specialize in
 

483
00:08:16,160 --> 00:08:18,150
all you need to do is specialize in
doing one thing the things you do best

484
00:08:18,150 --> 00:08:18,160
doing one thing the things you do best
 

485
00:08:18,160 --> 00:08:19,830
doing one thing the things you do best
and then you exchange that for money and

486
00:08:19,830 --> 00:08:19,840
and then you exchange that for money and
 

487
00:08:19,840 --> 00:08:21,749
and then you exchange that for money and
you don't have to worry about whether

488
00:08:21,749 --> 00:08:21,759
you don't have to worry about whether
 

489
00:08:21,759 --> 00:08:24,309
you don't have to worry about whether
the other people involved in this

490
00:08:24,309 --> 00:08:24,319
the other people involved in this
 

491
00:08:24,319 --> 00:08:26,150
the other people involved in this
want what you have and have what you

492
00:08:26,150 --> 00:08:26,160
want what you have and have what you
 

493
00:08:26,160 --> 00:08:28,469
want what you have and have what you
want you just sell it for money to

494
00:08:28,469 --> 00:08:28,479
want you just sell it for money to
 

495
00:08:28,479 --> 00:08:29,909
want you just sell it for money to
whoever wants it

496
00:08:29,909 --> 00:08:29,919
whoever wants it
 

497
00:08:29,919 --> 00:08:31,589
whoever wants it
and you buy whatever you want from

498
00:08:31,589 --> 00:08:31,599
and you buy whatever you want from
 

499
00:08:31,599 --> 00:08:35,350
and you buy whatever you want from
whoever has it and that's um an enormous

500
00:08:35,350 --> 00:08:35,360
whoever has it and that's um an enormous
 

501
00:08:35,360 --> 00:08:37,509
whoever has it and that's um an enormous
reduction in the mental burden of how a

502
00:08:37,509 --> 00:08:37,519
reduction in the mental burden of how a
 

503
00:08:37,519 --> 00:08:39,829
reduction in the mental burden of how a
market economy functions so the first

504
00:08:39,829 --> 00:08:39,839
market economy functions so the first
 

505
00:08:39,839 --> 00:08:40,870
market economy functions so the first
thing that i would say about money is

506
00:08:40,870 --> 00:08:40,880
thing that i would say about money is
 

507
00:08:40,880 --> 00:08:43,029
thing that i would say about money is
that it allows for the division of labor

508
00:08:43,029 --> 00:08:43,039
that it allows for the division of labor
 

509
00:08:43,039 --> 00:08:44,630
that it allows for the division of labor
and it allows for the market system to

510
00:08:44,630 --> 00:08:44,640
and it allows for the market system to
 

511
00:08:44,640 --> 00:08:46,949
and it allows for the market system to
grow and the second thing is that money

512
00:08:46,949 --> 00:08:46,959
grow and the second thing is that money
 

513
00:08:46,959 --> 00:08:49,110
grow and the second thing is that money
is a mechanism for storing value into

514
00:08:49,110 --> 00:08:49,120
is a mechanism for storing value into
 

515
00:08:49,120 --> 00:08:50,470
is a mechanism for storing value into
the future

516
00:08:50,470 --> 00:08:50,480
the future
 

517
00:08:50,480 --> 00:08:51,430
the future
so

518
00:08:51,430 --> 00:08:51,440
so
 

519
00:08:51,440 --> 00:08:53,670
so
again as humans we develop the capacity

520
00:08:53,670 --> 00:08:53,680
again as humans we develop the capacity
 

521
00:08:53,680 --> 00:08:54,949
again as humans we develop the capacity
to think

522
00:08:54,949 --> 00:08:54,959
to think
 

523
00:08:54,959 --> 00:08:57,190
to think
for the future we you know we we make a

524
00:08:57,190 --> 00:08:57,200
for the future we you know we we make a
 

525
00:08:57,200 --> 00:08:59,350
for the future we you know we we make a
spear so that we can hunt and then we

526
00:08:59,350 --> 00:08:59,360
spear so that we can hunt and then we
 

527
00:08:59,360 --> 00:09:00,949
spear so that we can hunt and then we
see that it works and then we take it

528
00:09:00,949 --> 00:09:00,959
see that it works and then we take it
 

529
00:09:00,959 --> 00:09:02,790
see that it works and then we take it
out of the animal that we hunted it with

530
00:09:02,790 --> 00:09:02,800
out of the animal that we hunted it with
 

531
00:09:02,800 --> 00:09:05,430
out of the animal that we hunted it with
and we keep it for the next day's hunt

532
00:09:05,430 --> 00:09:05,440
and we keep it for the next day's hunt
 

533
00:09:05,440 --> 00:09:06,949
and we keep it for the next day's hunt
and then we start making a better spear

534
00:09:06,949 --> 00:09:06,959
and then we start making a better spear
 

535
00:09:06,959 --> 00:09:08,389
and then we start making a better spear
and we make a better fishing rod and

536
00:09:08,389 --> 00:09:08,399
and we make a better fishing rod and
 

537
00:09:08,399 --> 00:09:10,070
and we make a better fishing rod and
then we make a fishing net and we make a

538
00:09:10,070 --> 00:09:10,080
then we make a fishing net and we make a
 

539
00:09:10,080 --> 00:09:11,269
then we make a fishing net and we make a
fishing boat

540
00:09:11,269 --> 00:09:11,279
fishing boat
 

541
00:09:11,279 --> 00:09:13,509
fishing boat
and that's our ability to

542
00:09:13,509 --> 00:09:13,519
and that's our ability to
 

543
00:09:13,519 --> 00:09:15,110
and that's our ability to
think of the future

544
00:09:15,110 --> 00:09:15,120
think of the future
 

545
00:09:15,120 --> 00:09:17,829
think of the future
and as we start building durable goods

546
00:09:17,829 --> 00:09:17,839
and as we start building durable goods
 

547
00:09:17,839 --> 00:09:19,350
and as we start building durable goods
we start thinking more and more of the

548
00:09:19,350 --> 00:09:19,360
we start thinking more and more of the
 

549
00:09:19,360 --> 00:09:20,710
we start thinking more and more of the
future we start becoming more and more

550
00:09:20,710 --> 00:09:20,720
future we start becoming more and more
 

551
00:09:20,720 --> 00:09:22,790
future we start becoming more and more
future oriented

552
00:09:22,790 --> 00:09:22,800
future oriented
 

553
00:09:22,800 --> 00:09:24,470
future oriented
and that's

554
00:09:24,470 --> 00:09:24,480
and that's
 

555
00:09:24,480 --> 00:09:26,550
and that's
really the process of civilization the

556
00:09:26,550 --> 00:09:26,560
really the process of civilization the
 

557
00:09:26,560 --> 00:09:29,509
really the process of civilization the
process of denying our needs now in

558
00:09:29,509 --> 00:09:29,519
process of denying our needs now in
 

559
00:09:29,519 --> 00:09:31,509
process of denying our needs now in
order to think for the future so instead

560
00:09:31,509 --> 00:09:31,519
order to think for the future so instead
 

561
00:09:31,519 --> 00:09:33,670
order to think for the future so instead
of spending all of our day on the beach

562
00:09:33,670 --> 00:09:33,680
of spending all of our day on the beach
 

563
00:09:33,680 --> 00:09:35,110
of spending all of our day on the beach
enjoying ourselves

564
00:09:35,110 --> 00:09:35,120
enjoying ourselves
 

565
00:09:35,120 --> 00:09:37,430
enjoying ourselves
we take time off from

566
00:09:37,430 --> 00:09:37,440
we take time off from
 

567
00:09:37,440 --> 00:09:40,710
we take time off from
leisure on the beach and spend some time

568
00:09:40,710 --> 00:09:40,720
leisure on the beach and spend some time
 

569
00:09:40,720 --> 00:09:43,910
leisure on the beach and spend some time
making a spear or making a fishing rod

570
00:09:43,910 --> 00:09:43,920
making a spear or making a fishing rod
 

571
00:09:43,920 --> 00:09:45,750
making a spear or making a fishing rod
so that our productivity in hunting or

572
00:09:45,750 --> 00:09:45,760
so that our productivity in hunting or
 

573
00:09:45,760 --> 00:09:47,990
so that our productivity in hunting or
fishing tomorrow is going to be higher

574
00:09:47,990 --> 00:09:48,000
fishing tomorrow is going to be higher
 

575
00:09:48,000 --> 00:09:50,710
fishing tomorrow is going to be higher
and so that ability to think for the

576
00:09:50,710 --> 00:09:50,720
and so that ability to think for the
 

577
00:09:50,720 --> 00:09:51,670
and so that ability to think for the
future

578
00:09:51,670 --> 00:09:51,680
future
 

579
00:09:51,680 --> 00:09:53,509
future
is enhanced by our ability to provide

580
00:09:53,509 --> 00:09:53,519
is enhanced by our ability to provide
 

581
00:09:53,519 --> 00:09:55,430
is enhanced by our ability to provide
for the future and we do that with

582
00:09:55,430 --> 00:09:55,440
for the future and we do that with
 

583
00:09:55,440 --> 00:09:58,470
for the future and we do that with
durable goods but then

584
00:09:58,470 --> 00:09:58,480
durable goods but then
 

585
00:09:58,480 --> 00:10:00,630
durable goods but then
money ends up being the best mechanism

586
00:10:00,630 --> 00:10:00,640
money ends up being the best mechanism
 

587
00:10:00,640 --> 00:10:02,870
money ends up being the best mechanism
for providing for the future because

588
00:10:02,870 --> 00:10:02,880
for providing for the future because
 

589
00:10:02,880 --> 00:10:04,710
for providing for the future because
you the future is uncertain so you know

590
00:10:04,710 --> 00:10:04,720
you the future is uncertain so you know
 

591
00:10:04,720 --> 00:10:07,829
you the future is uncertain so you know
you can um save your apples and oranges

592
00:10:07,829 --> 00:10:07,839
you can um save your apples and oranges
 

593
00:10:07,839 --> 00:10:10,230
you can um save your apples and oranges
you can save the spears you can save the

594
00:10:10,230 --> 00:10:10,240
you can save the spears you can save the
 

595
00:10:10,240 --> 00:10:12,069
you can save the spears you can save the
animal that you hunted

596
00:10:12,069 --> 00:10:12,079
animal that you hunted
 

597
00:10:12,079 --> 00:10:14,550
animal that you hunted
but these things um you know first they

598
00:10:14,550 --> 00:10:14,560
but these things um you know first they
 

599
00:10:14,560 --> 00:10:16,470
but these things um you know first they
rot and they're not very good at holding

600
00:10:16,470 --> 00:10:16,480
rot and they're not very good at holding
 

601
00:10:16,480 --> 00:10:17,750
rot and they're not very good at holding
on to their value over time but even if

602
00:10:17,750 --> 00:10:17,760
on to their value over time but even if
 

603
00:10:17,760 --> 00:10:19,030
on to their value over time but even if
they wear

604
00:10:19,030 --> 00:10:19,040
they wear
 

605
00:10:19,040 --> 00:10:21,350
they wear
even if you know have objects that are

606
00:10:21,350 --> 00:10:21,360
even if you know have objects that are
 

607
00:10:21,360 --> 00:10:23,750
even if you know have objects that are
durable the problem with them is that

608
00:10:23,750 --> 00:10:23,760
durable the problem with them is that
 

609
00:10:23,760 --> 00:10:25,430
durable the problem with them is that
you don't know if you need them

610
00:10:25,430 --> 00:10:25,440
you don't know if you need them
 

611
00:10:25,440 --> 00:10:27,990
you don't know if you need them
tomorrow or next month or next year

612
00:10:27,990 --> 00:10:28,000
tomorrow or next month or next year
 

613
00:10:28,000 --> 00:10:29,190
tomorrow or next month or next year
you're not sure if you're going to be

614
00:10:29,190 --> 00:10:29,200
you're not sure if you're going to be
 

615
00:10:29,200 --> 00:10:31,190
you're not sure if you're going to be
needing them and you might end up not

616
00:10:31,190 --> 00:10:31,200
needing them and you might end up not
 

617
00:10:31,200 --> 00:10:32,550
needing them and you might end up not
needing them and you might end up not

618
00:10:32,550 --> 00:10:32,560
needing them and you might end up not
 

619
00:10:32,560 --> 00:10:34,069
needing them and you might end up not
finding anybody who needs them or

620
00:10:34,069 --> 00:10:34,079
finding anybody who needs them or
 

621
00:10:34,079 --> 00:10:35,190
finding anybody who needs them or
finding somebody who needs them but

622
00:10:35,190 --> 00:10:35,200
finding somebody who needs them but
 

623
00:10:35,200 --> 00:10:36,790
finding somebody who needs them but
doesn't value them much and won't give

624
00:10:36,790 --> 00:10:36,800
doesn't value them much and won't give
 

625
00:10:36,800 --> 00:10:38,310
doesn't value them much and won't give
you much in exchange

626
00:10:38,310 --> 00:10:38,320
you much in exchange
 

627
00:10:38,320 --> 00:10:40,630
you much in exchange
money allows you the optionality of

628
00:10:40,630 --> 00:10:40,640
money allows you the optionality of
 

629
00:10:40,640 --> 00:10:42,470
money allows you the optionality of
saving the most liquid good the most

630
00:10:42,470 --> 00:10:42,480
saving the most liquid good the most
 

631
00:10:42,480 --> 00:10:44,389
saving the most liquid good the most
saleable good so it's something that you

632
00:10:44,389 --> 00:10:44,399
saleable good so it's something that you
 

633
00:10:44,399 --> 00:10:46,790
saleable good so it's something that you
can sell tomorrow with the least

634
00:10:46,790 --> 00:10:46,800
can sell tomorrow with the least
 

635
00:10:46,800 --> 00:10:48,630
can sell tomorrow with the least
uncertainty it has the most liquidity

636
00:10:48,630 --> 00:10:48,640
uncertainty it has the most liquidity
 

637
00:10:48,640 --> 00:10:50,310
uncertainty it has the most liquidity
the most ability to

638
00:10:50,310 --> 00:10:50,320
the most ability to
 

639
00:10:50,320 --> 00:10:53,030
the most ability to
be sold without a loss in its value so

640
00:10:53,030 --> 00:10:53,040
be sold without a loss in its value so
 

641
00:10:53,040 --> 00:10:55,350
be sold without a loss in its value so
money is our most advanced technology

642
00:10:55,350 --> 00:10:55,360
money is our most advanced technology
 

643
00:10:55,360 --> 00:10:57,110
money is our most advanced technology
and our best technology for moving value

644
00:10:57,110 --> 00:10:57,120
and our best technology for moving value
 

645
00:10:57,120 --> 00:10:58,310
and our best technology for moving value
into the future

646
00:10:58,310 --> 00:10:58,320
into the future
 

647
00:10:58,320 --> 00:10:59,430
into the future
and so

648
00:10:59,430 --> 00:10:59,440
and so
 

649
00:10:59,440 --> 00:11:02,550
and so
i think history really i argue this in

650
00:11:02,550 --> 00:11:02,560
i think history really i argue this in
 

651
00:11:02,560 --> 00:11:04,870
i think history really i argue this in
all my books is that really history we

652
00:11:04,870 --> 00:11:04,880
all my books is that really history we
 

653
00:11:04,880 --> 00:11:05,750
all my books is that really history we
see

654
00:11:05,750 --> 00:11:05,760
see
 

655
00:11:05,760 --> 00:11:08,710
see
um we can think of it as a process of

656
00:11:08,710 --> 00:11:08,720
um we can think of it as a process of
 

657
00:11:08,720 --> 00:11:10,550
um we can think of it as a process of
our money gets harder

658
00:11:10,550 --> 00:11:10,560
our money gets harder
 

659
00:11:10,560 --> 00:11:13,269
our money gets harder
and so our money is gets better at

660
00:11:13,269 --> 00:11:13,279
and so our money is gets better at
 

661
00:11:13,279 --> 00:11:15,910
and so our money is gets better at
holding on to its value for the future

662
00:11:15,910 --> 00:11:15,920
holding on to its value for the future
 

663
00:11:15,920 --> 00:11:18,470
holding on to its value for the future
and by harder i mean harder to produce

664
00:11:18,470 --> 00:11:18,480
and by harder i mean harder to produce
 

665
00:11:18,480 --> 00:11:20,230
and by harder i mean harder to produce
we we find things that are hard to

666
00:11:20,230 --> 00:11:20,240
we we find things that are hard to
 

667
00:11:20,240 --> 00:11:22,470
we we find things that are hard to
produce that are better at holding on to

668
00:11:22,470 --> 00:11:22,480
produce that are better at holding on to
 

669
00:11:22,480 --> 00:11:23,750
produce that are better at holding on to
their value so they hold on to their

670
00:11:23,750 --> 00:11:23,760
their value so they hold on to their
 

671
00:11:23,760 --> 00:11:25,590
their value so they hold on to their
value better for the future and that

672
00:11:25,590 --> 00:11:25,600
value better for the future and that
 

673
00:11:25,600 --> 00:11:27,590
value better for the future and that
allows us to plot and plan for the

674
00:11:27,590 --> 00:11:27,600
allows us to plot and plan for the
 

675
00:11:27,600 --> 00:11:30,069
allows us to plot and plan for the
future that makes the future less

676
00:11:30,069 --> 00:11:30,079
future that makes the future less
 

677
00:11:30,079 --> 00:11:32,790
future that makes the future less
uncertain and that makes us more future

678
00:11:32,790 --> 00:11:32,800
uncertain and that makes us more future
 

679
00:11:32,800 --> 00:11:35,269
uncertain and that makes us more future
oriented in other words it lowers our

680
00:11:35,269 --> 00:11:35,279
oriented in other words it lowers our
 

681
00:11:35,279 --> 00:11:36,550
oriented in other words it lowers our
time preference

682
00:11:36,550 --> 00:11:36,560
time preference
 

683
00:11:36,560 --> 00:11:39,590
time preference
and the harder the money is the better

684
00:11:39,590 --> 00:11:39,600
and the harder the money is the better
 

685
00:11:39,600 --> 00:11:41,430
and the harder the money is the better
it is allowing us to think of the future

686
00:11:41,430 --> 00:11:41,440
it is allowing us to think of the future
 

687
00:11:41,440 --> 00:11:43,670
it is allowing us to think of the future
so people should know that you've

688
00:11:43,670 --> 00:11:43,680
so people should know that you've
 

689
00:11:43,680 --> 00:11:45,910
so people should know that you've
written the the book bitcoin standard

690
00:11:45,910 --> 00:11:45,920
written the the book bitcoin standard
 

691
00:11:45,920 --> 00:11:47,750
written the the book bitcoin standard
from 2018

from 2018
 

693
00:11:47,760 --> 00:11:49,750
from 2018
i believe yeah and then a new book

694

i believe yeah and then a new book
called fiat standard uh the bitcoin

696
00:11:52,550 --> 00:11:52,560
called fiat standard uh the bitcoin
 

697
00:11:52,560 --> 00:11:54,069
called fiat standard uh the bitcoin
standard just considered kind of the

00:12:02,320 --> 00:12:04,230
rigorous systematic explanation of why
bitcoin what is it

706
00:12:04,230 --> 00:12:04,240
bitcoin what is it

describing in that book and in the new

712
00:12:09,990 --> 00:12:10,000
describing in that book and in the new
 

713
00:12:10,000 --> 00:12:10,790
describing in that book and in the new
book

714
00:12:10,790 --> 00:12:10,800
book
 

715
00:12:10,800 --> 00:12:12,310
book
different implementations of the

716
00:12:12,310 --> 00:12:12,320
different implementations of the
 

717
00:12:12,320 --> 00:12:14,389
different implementations of the
technology of money

718
00:12:14,389 --> 00:12:14,399
technology of money
 

719
00:12:14,399 --> 00:12:16,550
technology of money
in the new book you talk about

720
00:12:16,550 --> 00:12:16,560
in the new book you talk about
 

721
00:12:16,560 --> 00:12:18,790
in the new book you talk about
fiat money which is another way to do

722
00:12:18,790 --> 00:12:18,800
fiat money which is another way to do
 

723
00:12:18,800 --> 00:12:20,790
fiat money which is another way to do
money so obviously there's a lot of

724
00:12:20,790 --> 00:12:20,800
money so obviously there's a lot of
 

725
00:12:20,800 --> 00:12:23,269
money so obviously there's a lot of
different ways to do money and maybe you

726
00:12:23,269 --> 00:12:23,279
different ways to do money and maybe you
 

727
00:12:23,279 --> 00:12:24,710
different ways to do money and maybe you
haven't discovered the best way to do

728
00:12:24,710 --> 00:12:24,720
haven't discovered the best way to do
 

729
00:12:24,720 --> 00:12:27,030
haven't discovered the best way to do
money yet our conversation today is how

730
00:12:27,030 --> 00:12:27,040
money yet our conversation today is how
 

731
00:12:27,040 --> 00:12:29,910
money yet our conversation today is how
to do money better um maybe we'll go

732
00:12:29,910 --> 00:12:29,920
to do money better um maybe we'll go
 

733
00:12:29,920 --> 00:12:33,110
to do money better um maybe we'll go
back to bananas eventually uh right

734
00:12:33,110 --> 00:12:33,120
back to bananas eventually uh right
 

735
00:12:33,120 --> 00:12:35,430
back to bananas eventually uh right
very good reasons why we won't well we

736
00:12:35,430 --> 00:12:35,440
very good reasons why we won't well we
 

737
00:12:35,440 --> 00:12:38,310
very good reasons why we won't well we
can disagree uh we can agree to disagree

738
00:12:38,310 --> 00:12:38,320
can disagree uh we can agree to disagree
 

739
00:12:38,320 --> 00:12:39,190
can disagree uh we can agree to disagree
on this

740
00:12:39,190 --> 00:12:39,200
on this
 

741
00:12:39,200 --> 00:12:41,350
on this
now i'm open-minded to the bananas they

now i'm open-minded to the bananas they
 

743
00:12:41,360 --> 00:12:43,509
now i'm open-minded to the bananas they
uh they're one of the biggest sources of

744
00:12:43,509 --> 00:12:43,519
uh they're one of the biggest sources of
 

745
00:12:43,519 --> 00:12:44,949
uh they're one of the biggest sources of
joy to me when i first came to this

country
 

749
00:12:45,920 --> 00:12:48,949
country
is uh eating bananas and so

perishable happiness will eventually
 

759
00:12:55,440 --> 00:12:56,470
perishable happiness will eventually
become

760
00:12:56,470 --> 00:12:56,480
become

the the best medium of exchange i don't
know open-minded anyway so you mentioned

764
00:13:01,110 --> 00:13:01,120
know open-minded anyway so you mentioned

hard money and soft money says different

766

hard money and soft money says different
 

767
00:13:03,839 --> 00:13:06,629
hard money and soft money says different
ways to do money what is hard money what

768
00:13:06,629 --> 00:13:06,639
ways to do money what is hard money what
 

769
00:13:06,639 --> 00:13:08,230
ways to do money what is hard money what
is soft money

770
00:13:08,230 --> 00:13:08,240
is soft money
 

771
00:13:08,240 --> 00:13:09,829
is soft money
in the bitcoin standard i present the

772
00:13:09,829 --> 00:13:09,839
in the bitcoin standard i present the
 

773
00:13:09,839 --> 00:13:12,150
in the bitcoin standard i present the
argument that money is always whatever

774
00:13:12,150 --> 00:13:12,160
argument that money is always whatever
 

775
00:13:12,160 --> 00:13:14,710
argument that money is always whatever
is the hardest thing to make um

776
00:13:14,710 --> 00:13:14,720
is the hardest thing to make um
 

777
00:13:14,720 --> 00:13:16,069
is the hardest thing to make um
historically i think we see many

778
00:13:16,069 --> 00:13:16,079
historically i think we see many
 

779
00:13:16,079 --> 00:13:18,230
historically i think we see many
examples of that so for instance in

780
00:13:18,230 --> 00:13:18,240
examples of that so for instance in
 

781
00:13:18,240 --> 00:13:19,990
examples of that so for instance in
prison people use cigarettes as money

782
00:13:19,990 --> 00:13:20,000
prison people use cigarettes as money
 

783
00:13:20,000 --> 00:13:21,350
prison people use cigarettes as money
because nobody can make cigarettes in

784
00:13:21,350 --> 00:13:21,360
because nobody can make cigarettes in
 

785
00:13:21,360 --> 00:13:22,230
because nobody can make cigarettes in
prison

786

prison
 

787
00:13:22,240 --> 00:13:24,790
prison
in societies we have the example of yap

788
00:13:24,790 --> 00:13:24,800
in societies we have the example of yap
 

789
00:13:24,800 --> 00:13:26,629
in societies we have the example of yap
island for instance it's an island that

790
00:13:26,629 --> 00:13:26,639
island for instance it's an island that
 

791
00:13:26,639 --> 00:13:28,550
island for instance it's an island that
doesn't have any limestone but there's a

00:13:28,550 --> 00:13:28,560
doesn't have any limestone but there's a
 

793
00:13:28,560 --> 00:13:30,069
doesn't have any limestone but there's a
nearby island that has a lot of

and
 

799
00:13:32,079 --> 00:13:33,590
and
it's very expensive obviously with

800
00:13:33,590 --> 00:13:33,600
it's very expensive obviously with
 

801
00:13:33,600 --> 00:13:35,509
it's very expensive obviously with
primitive technology to move limestone

802
00:13:35,509 --> 00:13:35,519
primitive technology to move limestone
 

803
00:13:35,519 --> 00:13:39,430

making technology because they were

816
00:13:53,590 --> 00:13:53,600
making technology because they were
 

817
00:13:53,600 --> 00:13:55,030
making technology because they were
imported from abroad and they were very

818
00:13:55,030 --> 00:13:55,040
imported from abroad and they were very
 

819
00:13:55,040 --> 00:13:57,110
imported from abroad and they were very
hard to make

820
00:13:57,110 --> 00:13:57,120
hard to make
 

821
00:13:57,120 --> 00:13:59,189
hard to make
and i think there's a conscious effort

822
00:13:59,189 --> 00:13:59,199
and i think there's a conscious effort
 

823
00:13:59,199 --> 00:14:01,430
and i think there's a conscious effort
of some people might recognize the the

824
00:14:01,430 --> 00:14:01,440
of some people might recognize the the
 

825
00:14:01,440 --> 00:14:03,430
of some people might recognize the the
hardness and the scarcity and choose

826
00:14:03,430 --> 00:14:03,440
hardness and the scarcity and choose
 

827
00:14:03,440 --> 00:14:05,269
hardness and the scarcity and choose
this as money but i think what's more

828
00:14:05,269 --> 00:14:05,279
this as money but i think what's more
 

829
00:14:05,279 --> 00:14:07,910
this as money but i think what's more
important is just a natural evolutionary

830
00:14:07,910 --> 00:14:07,920
important is just a natural evolutionary
 

831
00:14:07,920 --> 00:14:09,750
important is just a natural evolutionary
process whereby

832
00:14:09,750 --> 00:14:09,760
process whereby
 

833
00:14:09,760 --> 00:14:11,829
process whereby
people choose all kinds of random things

834
00:14:11,829 --> 00:14:11,839
people choose all kinds of random things
 

835
00:14:11,839 --> 00:14:14,389
people choose all kinds of random things
as money bananas maybe even

836
00:14:14,389 --> 00:14:14,399
as money bananas maybe even
 

837
00:14:14,399 --> 00:14:15,750
as money bananas maybe even
but then the people who end up making

838
00:14:15,750 --> 00:14:15,760
but then the people who end up making
 

839
00:14:15,760 --> 00:14:17,990
but then the people who end up making
these bad choices um don't end up with

840
00:14:17,990 --> 00:14:18,000
these bad choices um don't end up with
 

841
00:14:18,000 --> 00:14:19,590
these bad choices um don't end up with
any wealth left whereas the people who

842
00:14:19,590 --> 00:14:19,600
any wealth left whereas the people who
 

843
00:14:19,600 --> 00:14:22,069
any wealth left whereas the people who
store the their wealth in the things

844
00:14:22,069 --> 00:14:22,079
store the their wealth in the things
 

845
00:14:22,079 --> 00:14:23,829
store the their wealth in the things
that are hard to make

846
00:14:23,829 --> 00:14:23,839
that are hard to make
 

847
00:14:23,839 --> 00:14:26,230
that are hard to make
end up acquiring end up maintaining

848
00:14:26,230 --> 00:14:26,240
end up acquiring end up maintaining
 

849
00:14:26,240 --> 00:14:27,910
end up acquiring end up maintaining
their wealth and maybe even increasing

850
00:14:27,910 --> 00:14:27,920
their wealth and maybe even increasing
 

851
00:14:27,920 --> 00:14:29,670
their wealth and maybe even increasing
it over time and of course this

852
00:14:29,670 --> 00:14:29,680
it over time and of course this
 

853
00:14:29,680 --> 00:14:31,990
it over time and of course this
culminated in the 19th century in the

854
00:14:31,990 --> 00:14:32,000
culminated in the 19th century in the
 

855
00:14:32,000 --> 00:14:33,829
culminated in the 19th century in the
end of the 19th century by the basically

856
00:14:33,829 --> 00:14:33,839
end of the 19th century by the basically
 

857
00:14:33,839 --> 00:14:35,750
end of the 19th century by the basically
the entire planet being on a gold

858
00:14:35,750 --> 00:14:35,760
the entire planet being on a gold
 

859
00:14:35,760 --> 00:14:36,790
the entire planet being on a gold
standard

860
00:14:36,790 --> 00:14:36,800
standard
 

861
00:14:36,800 --> 00:14:38,470
standard
and what is the gold standard

862
00:14:38,470 --> 00:14:38,480
and what is the gold standard
 

863
00:14:38,480 --> 00:14:40,389
and what is the gold standard
the gold standard is basically when

864
00:14:40,389 --> 00:14:40,399
the gold standard is basically when
 

865
00:14:40,399 --> 00:14:43,350
the gold standard is basically when
money is gold or at least government

866
00:14:43,350 --> 00:14:43,360
money is gold or at least government
 

867
00:14:43,360 --> 00:14:45,350
money is gold or at least government
currencies backed by gold but the reason

868
00:14:45,350 --> 00:14:45,360
currencies backed by gold but the reason
 

869
00:14:45,360 --> 00:14:47,750
currencies backed by gold but the reason
gold became money and not copper not

870
00:14:47,750 --> 00:14:47,760
gold became money and not copper not
 

871
00:14:47,760 --> 00:14:50,310
gold became money and not copper not
nickel not bananas is that gold is the

872
00:14:50,310 --> 00:14:50,320
nickel not bananas is that gold is the
 

873
00:14:50,320 --> 00:14:52,629
nickel not bananas is that gold is the
hardest metal in the world and it is the

874
00:14:52,629 --> 00:14:52,639
hardest metal in the world and it is the
 

875
00:14:52,639 --> 00:14:55,670
hardest metal in the world and it is the
hardest metal to increase the supply of

876
00:14:55,670 --> 00:14:55,680
hardest metal to increase the supply of
 

877
00:14:55,680 --> 00:14:57,269
hardest metal to increase the supply of
and the reason for that is based in

878
00:14:57,269 --> 00:14:57,279
and the reason for that is based in
 

879
00:14:57,279 --> 00:14:59,030
and the reason for that is based in
chemistry so

880
00:14:59,030 --> 00:14:59,040
chemistry so
 

881
00:14:59,040 --> 00:15:01,350
chemistry so
um gold is indestructible you can't

882
00:15:01,350 --> 00:15:01,360
um gold is indestructible you can't
 

883
00:15:01,360 --> 00:15:03,590
um gold is indestructible you can't
destroy gold in any meaningful sense

884
00:15:03,590 --> 00:15:03,600
destroy gold in any meaningful sense
 

885
00:15:03,600 --> 00:15:06,230
destroy gold in any meaningful sense
it's um it's it's it's been accumulating

886
00:15:06,230 --> 00:15:06,240
it's um it's it's it's been accumulating
 

887
00:15:06,240 --> 00:15:08,389
it's um it's it's it's been accumulating
stockpiles for thousands of years you

888
00:15:08,389 --> 00:15:08,399
stockpiles for thousands of years you
 

889
00:15:08,399 --> 00:15:10,550
stockpiles for thousands of years you
know the gold that was worn by nefertiti

890
00:15:10,550 --> 00:15:10,560
know the gold that was worn by nefertiti
 

891
00:15:10,560 --> 00:15:13,110
know the gold that was worn by nefertiti
back in ancient egypt is

892
00:15:13,110 --> 00:15:13,120
back in ancient egypt is
 

893
00:15:13,120 --> 00:15:15,829
back in ancient egypt is
today um probably in somebody's necklace

894
00:15:15,829 --> 00:15:15,839
today um probably in somebody's necklace
 

895
00:15:15,839 --> 00:15:17,430
today um probably in somebody's necklace
or in somebody's gold coin it's still

896
00:15:17,430 --> 00:15:17,440
or in somebody's gold coin it's still
 

897
00:15:17,440 --> 00:15:19,430
or in somebody's gold coin it's still
there so for thousands of years humans

898
00:15:19,430 --> 00:15:19,440
there so for thousands of years humans
 

899
00:15:19,440 --> 00:15:21,430
there so for thousands of years humans
have been digging for gold they dig it

900
00:15:21,430 --> 00:15:21,440
have been digging for gold they dig it
 

901
00:15:21,440 --> 00:15:23,189
have been digging for gold they dig it
out of the ground they refine it and

902
00:15:23,189 --> 00:15:23,199
out of the ground they refine it and
 

903
00:15:23,199 --> 00:15:25,750
out of the ground they refine it and
then they put it in a jewelry or a coin

904
00:15:25,750 --> 00:15:25,760
then they put it in a jewelry or a coin
 

905
00:15:25,760 --> 00:15:27,670
then they put it in a jewelry or a coin
and then it just stays there um it gets

906
00:15:27,670 --> 00:15:27,680
and then it just stays there um it gets
 

907
00:15:27,680 --> 00:15:29,590
and then it just stays there um it gets
melted down into new other forms you

908
00:15:29,590 --> 00:15:29,600
melted down into new other forms you
 

909
00:15:29,600 --> 00:15:31,350
melted down into new other forms you
know the jewelry gets turned into coins

910
00:15:31,350 --> 00:15:31,360
know the jewelry gets turned into coins
 

911
00:15:31,360 --> 00:15:34,150
know the jewelry gets turned into coins
or coins get turned into bars

912
00:15:34,150 --> 00:15:34,160
or coins get turned into bars
 

913
00:15:34,160 --> 00:15:36,389
or coins get turned into bars
but it's um it's just

914
00:15:36,389 --> 00:15:36,399
but it's um it's just
 

915
00:15:36,399 --> 00:15:38,710
but it's um it's just
stockpiles that are accumulating on the

916
00:15:38,710 --> 00:15:38,720
stockpiles that are accumulating on the
 

917
00:15:38,720 --> 00:15:40,230
stockpiles that are accumulating on the
other hand

918
00:15:40,230 --> 00:15:40,240
other hand
 

919
00:15:40,240 --> 00:15:42,389
other hand
every year we get better at our

920
00:15:42,389 --> 00:15:42,399
every year we get better at our
 

921
00:15:42,399 --> 00:15:43,749
every year we get better at our
technology of looking for gold you know

922
00:15:43,749 --> 00:15:43,759
technology of looking for gold you know
 

923
00:15:43,759 --> 00:15:45,269
technology of looking for gold you know
there's more people all over the world

924
00:15:45,269 --> 00:15:45,279
there's more people all over the world
 

925
00:15:45,279 --> 00:15:46,949
there's more people all over the world
the population increases the technology

926
00:15:46,949 --> 00:15:46,959
the population increases the technology
 

927
00:15:46,959 --> 00:15:48,949
the population increases the technology
improves so we keep finding more and

928
00:15:48,949 --> 00:15:48,959
improves so we keep finding more and
 

929
00:15:48,959 --> 00:15:50,710
improves so we keep finding more and
more gold and we keep making the

930
00:15:50,710 --> 00:15:50,720
more gold and we keep making the
 

931
00:15:50,720 --> 00:15:53,110
more gold and we keep making the
stockpiles bigger however

932
00:15:53,110 --> 00:15:53,120
stockpiles bigger however
 

933
00:15:53,120 --> 00:15:54,629
stockpiles bigger however
because we're constantly adding to a

934
00:15:54,629 --> 00:15:54,639
because we're constantly adding to a
 

935
00:15:54,639 --> 00:15:57,590
because we're constantly adding to a
stockpile that is not uh being devalued

936
00:15:57,590 --> 00:15:57,600
stockpile that is not uh being devalued
 

937
00:15:57,600 --> 00:15:59,110
stockpile that is not uh being devalued
sorry that it's not being consumed

938
00:15:59,110 --> 00:15:59,120
sorry that it's not being consumed
 

939
00:15:59,120 --> 00:16:00,470
sorry that it's not being consumed
because there's no way of consuming gold

940
00:16:00,470 --> 00:16:00,480
because there's no way of consuming gold
 

941
00:16:00,480 --> 00:16:03,030
because there's no way of consuming gold
you can't eat it you can't burn it you

942
00:16:03,030 --> 00:16:03,040
you can't eat it you can't burn it you
 

943
00:16:03,040 --> 00:16:05,189
you can't eat it you can't burn it you
can't it doesn't rust

944
00:16:05,189 --> 00:16:05,199
can't it doesn't rust
 

945
00:16:05,199 --> 00:16:06,949
can't it doesn't rust
um because of that we're constantly

946
00:16:06,949 --> 00:16:06,959
um because of that we're constantly
 

947
00:16:06,959 --> 00:16:08,790
um because of that we're constantly
adding to a constantly growing stockpile

948
00:16:08,790 --> 00:16:08,800
adding to a constantly growing stockpile
 

949
00:16:08,800 --> 00:16:10,949
adding to a constantly growing stockpile
so if you look at the numbers

950
00:16:10,949 --> 00:16:10,959
so if you look at the numbers
 

951
00:16:10,959 --> 00:16:11,990
so if you look at the numbers
you see

952
00:16:11,990 --> 00:16:12,000
you see
 

953
00:16:12,000 --> 00:16:13,829
you see
over the last 100 years we've got pretty

954
00:16:13,829 --> 00:16:13,839
over the last 100 years we've got pretty
 

955
00:16:13,839 --> 00:16:15,350
over the last 100 years we've got pretty
reliable data on gold production

956
00:16:15,350 --> 00:16:15,360
reliable data on gold production
 

957
00:16:15,360 --> 00:16:17,990
reliable data on gold production
worldwide we see that pretty much gold

958
00:16:17,990 --> 00:16:18,000
worldwide we see that pretty much gold
 

959
00:16:18,000 --> 00:16:19,749
worldwide we see that pretty much gold
stockpiles increase at around one and a

960
00:16:19,749 --> 00:16:19,759
stockpiles increase at around one and a
 

961
00:16:19,759 --> 00:16:22,389
stockpiles increase at around one and a
half to two percent per year every year

962
00:16:22,389 --> 00:16:22,399
half to two percent per year every year
 

963
00:16:22,399 --> 00:16:25,030
half to two percent per year every year
so yes we we're making more every year

964
00:16:25,030 --> 00:16:25,040
so yes we we're making more every year
 

965
00:16:25,040 --> 00:16:25,910
so yes we we're making more every year
but

966
00:16:25,910 --> 00:16:25,920
but
 

967
00:16:25,920 --> 00:16:27,509
but
we're making more so we're adding to the

968
00:16:27,509 --> 00:16:27,519
we're making more so we're adding to the
 

969
00:16:27,519 --> 00:16:29,350
we're making more so we're adding to the
stockpile the stockpile grows more so

970
00:16:29,350 --> 00:16:29,360
stockpile the stockpile grows more so
 

971
00:16:29,360 --> 00:16:31,110
stockpile the stockpile grows more so
every year we're adding only around one

972
00:16:31,110 --> 00:16:31,120
every year we're adding only around one
 

973
00:16:31,120 --> 00:16:33,749
every year we're adding only around one
and a half to two percent

974
00:16:33,749 --> 00:16:33,759
and a half to two percent
 

975
00:16:33,759 --> 00:16:35,829
and a half to two percent
compare that to the second

976
00:16:35,829 --> 00:16:35,839
compare that to the second
 

977
00:16:35,839 --> 00:16:37,430
compare that to the second
highest the second hardest metal

978
00:16:37,430 --> 00:16:37,440
highest the second hardest metal
 

979
00:16:37,440 --> 00:16:39,590
highest the second hardest metal
historically was silver and that

980
00:16:39,590 --> 00:16:39,600
historically was silver and that
 

981
00:16:39,600 --> 00:16:41,910
historically was silver and that
increased historically around maybe five

982
00:16:41,910 --> 00:16:41,920
increased historically around maybe five
 

983
00:16:41,920 --> 00:16:44,389
increased historically around maybe five
percent per year or so now it probably

984
00:16:44,389 --> 00:16:44,399
percent per year or so now it probably
 

985
00:16:44,399 --> 00:16:46,389
percent per year or so now it probably
increases something like closer to 30

986
00:16:46,389 --> 00:16:46,399
increases something like closer to 30
 

987
00:16:46,399 --> 00:16:48,470
increases something like closer to 30
percent because it's now getting used

988
00:16:48,470 --> 00:16:48,480
percent because it's now getting used
 

989
00:16:48,480 --> 00:16:51,030
percent because it's now getting used
extensively in industrial uses so when

990
00:16:51,030 --> 00:16:51,040
extensively in industrial uses so when
 

991
00:16:51,040 --> 00:16:53,670
extensively in industrial uses so when
you use it in the in industry um you

992
00:16:53,670 --> 00:16:53,680
you use it in the in industry um you
 

993
00:16:53,680 --> 00:16:55,430
you use it in the in industry um you
know when you put silver in a laptop or

994
00:16:55,430 --> 00:16:55,440
know when you put silver in a laptop or
 

995
00:16:55,440 --> 00:16:58,150
know when you put silver in a laptop or
in a camera or in a machine

996
00:16:58,150 --> 00:16:58,160
in a camera or in a machine
 

997
00:16:58,160 --> 00:16:59,430
in a camera or in a machine
effectively

998
00:16:59,430 --> 00:16:59,440
effectively
 

999
00:16:59,440 --> 00:17:01,110
effectively
you are consuming the stockpot because

1000
00:17:01,110 --> 00:17:01,120
you are consuming the stockpot because
 

1001
00:17:01,120 --> 00:17:03,269
you are consuming the stockpot because
it's not used as money it's taken out of

1002
00:17:03,269 --> 00:17:03,279
it's not used as money it's taken out of
 

1003
00:17:03,279 --> 00:17:05,510
it's not used as money it's taken out of
the monetary stockpile so over the last

1004
00:17:05,510 --> 00:17:05,520
the monetary stockpile so over the last
 

1005
00:17:05,520 --> 00:17:08,390
the monetary stockpile so over the last
150 years since 1870 in particular and i

1006
00:17:08,390 --> 00:17:08,400
150 years since 1870 in particular and i
 

1007
00:17:08,400 --> 00:17:10,549
150 years since 1870 in particular and i
discussed this in detail in uh the

1008
00:17:10,549 --> 00:17:10,559
discussed this in detail in uh the
 

1009
00:17:10,559 --> 00:17:11,990
discussed this in detail in uh the
bitcoin standard

1010
00:17:11,990 --> 00:17:12,000
bitcoin standard
 

1011
00:17:12,000 --> 00:17:14,470
bitcoin standard
what happened in 1870 was uh germany won

1012
00:17:14,470 --> 00:17:14,480
what happened in 1870 was uh germany won
 

1013
00:17:14,480 --> 00:17:16,390
what happened in 1870 was uh germany won
the franco-prussian war

1014
00:17:16,390 --> 00:17:16,400
the franco-prussian war
 

1015
00:17:16,400 --> 00:17:19,029
the franco-prussian war
and germany was on a silver standard but

1016
00:17:19,029 --> 00:17:19,039
and germany was on a silver standard but
 

1017
00:17:19,039 --> 00:17:21,189
and germany was on a silver standard but
the value of silvers was declining so

1018
00:17:21,189 --> 00:17:21,199
the value of silvers was declining so
 

1019
00:17:21,199 --> 00:17:22,710
the value of silvers was declining so
germany did something very smart which

1020
00:17:22,710 --> 00:17:22,720
germany did something very smart which
 

1021
00:17:22,720 --> 00:17:25,590
germany did something very smart which
is they took their indemnity from france

1022
00:17:25,590 --> 00:17:25,600
is they took their indemnity from france
 

1023
00:17:25,600 --> 00:17:29,190
is they took their indemnity from france
in uh silver and gold and used that big

1024
00:17:29,190 --> 00:17:29,200
in uh silver and gold and used that big
 

1025
00:17:29,200 --> 00:17:31,830
in uh silver and gold and used that big
chunk of gold to switch to going on a

1026
00:17:31,830 --> 00:17:31,840
chunk of gold to switch to going on a
 

1027
00:17:31,840 --> 00:17:34,390
chunk of gold to switch to going on a
gold standard and since then silver's

1028
00:17:34,390 --> 00:17:34,400
gold standard and since then silver's
 

1029
00:17:34,400 --> 00:17:36,710
gold standard and since then silver's
been collapsing in value

1030
00:17:36,710 --> 00:17:36,720
been collapsing in value
 

1031
00:17:36,720 --> 00:17:38,870
been collapsing in value
next to gold so back then the price of

1032
00:17:38,870 --> 00:17:38,880
next to gold so back then the price of
 

1033
00:17:38,880 --> 00:17:41,190
next to gold so back then the price of
an ounce of gold was around 15 ounces of

1034
00:17:41,190 --> 00:17:41,200
an ounce of gold was around 15 ounces of
 

1035
00:17:41,200 --> 00:17:43,430
an ounce of gold was around 15 ounces of
silver today it's closer to 100 it's

1036
00:17:43,430 --> 00:17:43,440
silver today it's closer to 100 it's
 

1037
00:17:43,440 --> 00:17:45,510
silver today it's closer to 100 it's
just been declining for the last 150

1038
00:17:45,510 --> 00:17:45,520
just been declining for the last 150
 

1039
00:17:45,520 --> 00:17:46,390
just been declining for the last 150
years

1040
00:17:46,390 --> 00:17:46,400
years
 

1041
00:17:46,400 --> 00:17:48,070
years
and so because of that because of the

1042
00:17:48,070 --> 00:17:48,080
and so because of that because of the
 

1043
00:17:48,080 --> 00:17:50,710
and so because of that because of the
fact that it's lost its monetary role as

1044
00:17:50,710 --> 00:17:50,720
fact that it's lost its monetary role as
 

1045
00:17:50,720 --> 00:17:52,710
fact that it's lost its monetary role as
people shifted toward gold

1046
00:17:52,710 --> 00:17:52,720
people shifted toward gold
 

1047
00:17:52,720 --> 00:17:54,789
people shifted toward gold
the value of silver went down and so it

1048
00:17:54,789 --> 00:17:54,799
the value of silver went down and so it
 

1049
00:17:54,799 --> 00:17:56,390
the value of silver went down and so it
became economical to use it in more and

1050
00:17:56,390 --> 00:17:56,400
became economical to use it in more and
 

1051
00:17:56,400 --> 00:17:58,390
became economical to use it in more and
more industrial applications so the

1052
00:17:58,390 --> 00:17:58,400
more industrial applications so the
 

1053
00:17:58,400 --> 00:18:01,510
more industrial applications so the
stockpile declines and then as a result

1054
00:18:01,510 --> 00:18:01,520
stockpile declines and then as a result
 

1055
00:18:01,520 --> 00:18:03,430
stockpile declines and then as a result
uh that

1056
00:18:03,430 --> 00:18:03,440
uh that
 

1057
00:18:03,440 --> 00:18:05,430
uh that
weakens its monetary properties more and

1058
00:18:05,430 --> 00:18:05,440
weakens its monetary properties more and
 

1059
00:18:05,440 --> 00:18:06,710
weakens its monetary properties more and
more and more

1060
00:18:06,710 --> 00:18:06,720
more and more
 

1061
00:18:06,720 --> 00:18:08,950
more and more
so that's why by the end of the 19th

1062
00:18:08,950 --> 00:18:08,960
so that's why by the end of the 19th
 

1063
00:18:08,960 --> 00:18:10,150
so that's why by the end of the 19th
century i mean at the beginning of the

1064
00:18:10,150 --> 00:18:10,160
century i mean at the beginning of the
 

1065
00:18:10,160 --> 00:18:12,070
century i mean at the beginning of the
19th century gold and silver were money

1066
00:18:12,070 --> 00:18:12,080
19th century gold and silver were money
 

1067
00:18:12,080 --> 00:18:14,310
19th century gold and silver were money
by the end it was basically only gold

1068
00:18:14,310 --> 00:18:14,320
by the end it was basically only gold
 

1069
00:18:14,320 --> 00:18:15,510
by the end it was basically only gold
and the countries that were still on a

1070
00:18:15,510 --> 00:18:15,520
and the countries that were still on a
 

1071
00:18:15,520 --> 00:18:17,590
and the countries that were still on a
silver standard china and india in

1072
00:18:17,590 --> 00:18:17,600
silver standard china and india in
 

1073
00:18:17,600 --> 00:18:19,669
silver standard china and india in
particular suffered enormously from it

1074
00:18:19,669 --> 00:18:19,679
particular suffered enormously from it
 

1075
00:18:19,679 --> 00:18:22,470
particular suffered enormously from it
because their money was devaluing very

1076
00:18:22,470 --> 00:18:22,480
because their money was devaluing very
 

1077
00:18:22,480 --> 00:18:24,390
because their money was devaluing very
quickly next to gold and so europeans

1078
00:18:24,390 --> 00:18:24,400
quickly next to gold and so europeans
 

1079
00:18:24,400 --> 00:18:27,110
quickly next to gold and so europeans
would come to china or india were able

1080
00:18:27,110 --> 00:18:27,120
would come to china or india were able
 

1081
00:18:27,120 --> 00:18:29,190
would come to china or india were able
to buy things at practically a big

1082
00:18:29,190 --> 00:18:29,200
to buy things at practically a big
 

1083
00:18:29,200 --> 00:18:30,230
to buy things at practically a big
discount

1084
00:18:30,230 --> 00:18:30,240
discount
 

1085
00:18:30,240 --> 00:18:32,710
discount
so i hope it's okay if i ask

1086
00:18:32,710 --> 00:18:32,720
so i hope it's okay if i ask
 

1087
00:18:32,720 --> 00:18:34,710
so i hope it's okay if i ask
very simple very basic questions there's

1088
00:18:34,710 --> 00:18:34,720
very simple very basic questions there's
 

1089
00:18:34,720 --> 00:18:36,070
very simple very basic questions there's
few people

1090
00:18:36,070 --> 00:18:36,080
few people
 

1091
00:18:36,080 --> 00:18:38,310
few people
in this world that are good as good as

1092
00:18:38,310 --> 00:18:38,320
in this world that are good as good as
 

1093
00:18:38,320 --> 00:18:41,029
in this world that are good as good as
you are at answering very basic

1094
00:18:41,029 --> 00:18:41,039
you are at answering very basic
 

1095
00:18:41,039 --> 00:18:42,789
you are at answering very basic
uh almost ridiculously basic questions

1096
00:18:42,789 --> 00:18:42,799
uh almost ridiculously basic questions
 

1097
00:18:42,799 --> 00:18:43,909
uh almost ridiculously basic questions
because i think

1098
00:18:43,909 --> 00:18:43,919
because i think
 

1099
00:18:43,919 --> 00:18:45,830
because i think
exploring questions like what is money

1100
00:18:45,830 --> 00:18:45,840
exploring questions like what is money
 

1101
00:18:45,840 --> 00:18:48,070
exploring questions like what is money
is a really great way to uh to think

1102
00:18:48,070 --> 00:18:48,080
is a really great way to uh to think
 

1103
00:18:48,080 --> 00:18:49,510
is a really great way to uh to think
from first principles to really think

1104
00:18:49,510 --> 00:18:49,520
from first principles to really think
 

1105
00:18:49,520 --> 00:18:51,190
from first principles to really think
deeply about this world so i really

1106
00:18:51,190 --> 00:18:51,200
deeply about this world so i really
 

1107
00:18:51,200 --> 00:18:52,870
deeply about this world so i really
appreciate you doing that um when you

1108
00:18:52,870 --> 00:18:52,880
appreciate you doing that um when you
 

1109
00:18:52,880 --> 00:18:54,390
appreciate you doing that um when you
say standard

1110
00:18:54,390 --> 00:18:54,400
say standard
 

1111
00:18:54,400 --> 00:18:56,070
say standard
what does it mean when you say silver

1112
00:18:56,070 --> 00:18:56,080
what does it mean when you say silver
 

1113
00:18:56,080 --> 00:18:58,150
what does it mean when you say silver
standard gold standard again with the

1114
00:18:58,150 --> 00:18:58,160
standard gold standard again with the
 

1115
00:18:58,160 --> 00:18:59,909
standard gold standard again with the
basic question

1116
00:18:59,909 --> 00:18:59,919
basic question
 

1117
00:18:59,919 --> 00:19:02,789
basic question
the term really i think was based out of

1118
00:19:02,789 --> 00:19:02,799
the term really i think was based out of
 

1119
00:19:02,799 --> 00:19:03,750
the term really i think was based out of
gold

1120
00:19:03,750 --> 00:19:03,760
gold
 

1121
00:19:03,760 --> 00:19:05,430
gold
the first time this came out was the

1122
00:19:05,430 --> 00:19:05,440
the first time this came out was the
 

1123
00:19:05,440 --> 00:19:08,470
the first time this came out was the
gold standard because um so i i said

1124
00:19:08,470 --> 00:19:08,480
gold standard because um so i i said
 

1125
00:19:08,480 --> 00:19:09,909
gold standard because um so i i said
gold was money at the end of the 19th

1126
00:19:09,909 --> 00:19:09,919
gold was money at the end of the 19th
 

1127
00:19:09,919 --> 00:19:11,750
gold was money at the end of the 19th
century but it wasn't just that

1128
00:19:11,750 --> 00:19:11,760
century but it wasn't just that
 

1129
00:19:11,760 --> 00:19:13,830
century but it wasn't just that
everybody was using gold coins and

1130
00:19:13,830 --> 00:19:13,840
everybody was using gold coins and
 

1131
00:19:13,840 --> 00:19:16,150
everybody was using gold coins and
trading with gold coins because that's

1132
00:19:16,150 --> 00:19:16,160
trading with gold coins because that's
 

1133
00:19:16,160 --> 00:19:20,390
trading with gold coins because that's
got a problem of um divisibility so

1134
00:19:20,390 --> 00:19:20,400
got a problem of um divisibility so
 

1135
00:19:20,400 --> 00:19:22,710
got a problem of um divisibility so
a lot of things are worth less than one

1136
00:19:22,710 --> 00:19:22,720
a lot of things are worth less than one
 

1137
00:19:22,720 --> 00:19:25,029
a lot of things are worth less than one
gold coin so how do you buy that thing

1138
00:19:25,029 --> 00:19:25,039
gold coin so how do you buy that thing
 

1139
00:19:25,039 --> 00:19:27,110
gold coin so how do you buy that thing
and the answer was that you created

1140
00:19:27,110 --> 00:19:27,120
and the answer was that you created
 

1141
00:19:27,120 --> 00:19:29,110
and the answer was that you created
monetary instruments that were backed by

1142
00:19:29,110 --> 00:19:29,120
monetary instruments that were backed by
 

1143
00:19:29,120 --> 00:19:30,150
monetary instruments that were backed by
gold

1144
00:19:30,150 --> 00:19:30,160
gold
 

1145
00:19:30,160 --> 00:19:32,630
gold
and so currencies national currencies

1146
00:19:32,630 --> 00:19:32,640
and so currencies national currencies
 

1147
00:19:32,640 --> 00:19:35,430
and so currencies national currencies
under the gold standard wear specific

1148
00:19:35,430 --> 00:19:35,440
under the gold standard wear specific
 

1149
00:19:35,440 --> 00:19:37,590
under the gold standard wear specific
units of gold and that's how a gold

1150
00:19:37,590 --> 00:19:37,600
units of gold and that's how a gold
 

1151
00:19:37,600 --> 00:19:39,750
units of gold and that's how a gold
standard functioned money was gold but

1152
00:19:39,750 --> 00:19:39,760
standard functioned money was gold but
 

1153
00:19:39,760 --> 00:19:41,830
standard functioned money was gold but
you had pieces of paper

1154
00:19:41,830 --> 00:19:41,840
you had pieces of paper
 

1155
00:19:41,840 --> 00:19:43,990
you had pieces of paper
that were redeemable in gold so you

1156
00:19:43,990 --> 00:19:44,000
that were redeemable in gold so you
 

1157
00:19:44,000 --> 00:19:45,270
that were redeemable in gold so you
could go to the central bank you'd give

1158
00:19:45,270 --> 00:19:45,280
could go to the central bank you'd give
 

1159
00:19:45,280 --> 00:19:46,150
could go to the central bank you'd give
them the

1160
00:19:46,150 --> 00:19:46,160
them the
 

1161
00:19:46,160 --> 00:19:48,549
them the
piece of paper the 100 bill or the 10

1162
00:19:48,549 --> 00:19:48,559
piece of paper the 100 bill or the 10
 

1163
00:19:48,559 --> 00:19:50,230
piece of paper the 100 bill or the 10
bill and they'll give you gold in

1164
00:19:50,230 --> 00:19:50,240
bill and they'll give you gold in
 

1165
00:19:50,240 --> 00:19:51,990
bill and they'll give you gold in
exchange and they give you a specific

1166
00:19:51,990 --> 00:19:52,000
exchange and they give you a specific
 

1167
00:19:52,000 --> 00:19:54,230
exchange and they give you a specific
quantity of gold in exchange effectively

1168
00:19:54,230 --> 00:19:54,240
quantity of gold in exchange effectively
 

1169
00:19:54,240 --> 00:19:56,150
quantity of gold in exchange effectively
the paper was just the receipt for gold

1170
00:19:56,150 --> 00:19:56,160
the paper was just the receipt for gold
 

1171
00:19:56,160 --> 00:19:58,390
the paper was just the receipt for gold
so the paper exactly represented the

1172
00:19:58,390 --> 00:19:58,400
so the paper exactly represented the
 

1173
00:19:58,400 --> 00:20:01,270
so the paper exactly represented the
amount of gold exactly that was the plan

1174
00:20:01,270 --> 00:20:01,280
amount of gold exactly that was the plan
 

1175
00:20:01,280 --> 00:20:02,870
amount of gold exactly that was the plan
that was that was what it's supposed to

1176
00:20:02,870 --> 00:20:02,880
that was that was what it's supposed to
 

1177
00:20:02,880 --> 00:20:04,149
that was that was what it's supposed to
do but

1178
00:20:04,149 --> 00:20:04,159
do but
 

1179
00:20:04,159 --> 00:20:06,470
do but
arguably we never had a pure

1180
00:20:06,470 --> 00:20:06,480
arguably we never had a pure
 

1181
00:20:06,480 --> 00:20:08,870
arguably we never had a pure
gold standard because the nature of gold

1182
00:20:08,870 --> 00:20:08,880
gold standard because the nature of gold
 

1183
00:20:08,880 --> 00:20:10,149
gold standard because the nature of gold
means that the people who are in charge

1184
00:20:10,149 --> 00:20:10,159
means that the people who are in charge
 

1185
00:20:10,159 --> 00:20:11,430
means that the people who are in charge
of the gold

1186
00:20:11,430 --> 00:20:11,440
of the gold
 

1187
00:20:11,440 --> 00:20:13,430
of the gold
um they have an enormous amount of power

1188
00:20:13,430 --> 00:20:13,440
um they have an enormous amount of power
 

1189
00:20:13,440 --> 00:20:14,789
um they have an enormous amount of power
because the gold is concentrated with

1190
00:20:14,789 --> 00:20:14,799
because the gold is concentrated with
 

1191
00:20:14,799 --> 00:20:16,390
because the gold is concentrated with
them and as long as not everybody shows

1192
00:20:16,390 --> 00:20:16,400
them and as long as not everybody shows
 

1193
00:20:16,400 --> 00:20:18,470
them and as long as not everybody shows
up at the same time asking for their

1194
00:20:18,470 --> 00:20:18,480
up at the same time asking for their
 

1195
00:20:18,480 --> 00:20:19,830
up at the same time asking for their
gold then you can make more receipts

1196
00:20:19,830 --> 00:20:19,840
gold then you can make more receipts
 

1197
00:20:19,840 --> 00:20:22,070
gold then you can make more receipts
than you have gold sure this is there's

1198
00:20:22,070 --> 00:20:22,080
than you have gold sure this is there's
 

1199
00:20:22,080 --> 00:20:24,310
than you have gold sure this is there's
always uh shady stuff going on but at

1200
00:20:24,310 --> 00:20:24,320
always uh shady stuff going on but at
 

1201
00:20:24,320 --> 00:20:26,310
always uh shady stuff going on but at
least that's the state of goal is the

1202
00:20:26,310 --> 00:20:26,320
least that's the state of goal is the
 

1203
00:20:26,320 --> 00:20:28,310
least that's the state of goal is the
receipt should exactly represent the

1204
00:20:28,310 --> 00:20:28,320
receipt should exactly represent the
 

1205
00:20:28,320 --> 00:20:30,310
receipt should exactly represent the
amount of gold there and also when you

1206
00:20:30,310 --> 00:20:30,320
amount of gold there and also when you
 

1207
00:20:30,320 --> 00:20:31,669
amount of gold there and also when you
say standard

1208
00:20:31,669 --> 00:20:31,679
say standard
 

1209
00:20:31,679 --> 00:20:36,710
say standard
it means that uh governments

1210
00:20:36,710 --> 00:20:36,720

 

1211
00:20:36,720 --> 00:20:39,430

sort of publicly stated that this is

1217
00:20:44,240 --> 00:20:45,909
transactions that are monetary so this
is the money this is this is the

00:20:47,520 --> 00:20:49,909
official money that you should be using
if you live in this country yes although

1222
00:20:49,909 --> 00:20:49,919
if you live in this country yes although
 

1223
00:20:49,919 --> 00:20:51,590
if you live in this country yes although
i would say it's more like the other way

1224
00:20:51,590 --> 00:20:51,600
i would say it's more like the other way
 

1225
00:20:51,600 --> 00:20:53,590
i would say it's more like the other way
around it's not that the government's uh

1226
00:20:53,590 --> 00:20:53,600
around it's not that the government's uh
 

1227
00:20:53,600 --> 00:20:55,990
around it's not that the government's uh
established gold as money it's more like

00:20:55,990 --> 00:20:56,000
established gold as money it's more like
 

1229
00:20:56,000 --> 00:20:57,190
established gold as money it's more like
the

1230
00:20:57,190 --> 00:20:57,200
the
 

1231
00:20:57,200 --> 00:20:59,909
the
it's more like gold gave the governments

1232
00:20:59,909 --> 00:20:59,919
it's more like gold gave the governments
 

1233
00:20:59,919 --> 00:21:02,950
it's more like gold gave the governments
the credibility for their currencies so

1234
00:21:02,950 --> 00:21:02,960
the credibility for their currencies so
 

1235
00:21:02,960 --> 00:21:04,630
the credibility for their currencies so
governments were not

1236
00:21:04,630 --> 00:21:04,640
governments were not
 

1237
00:21:04,640 --> 00:21:06,630
governments were not
the ones that made gold money gold has

1238
00:21:06,630 --> 00:21:06,640
the ones that made gold money gold has
 

1239
00:21:06,640 --> 00:21:09,750
the ones that made gold money gold has
been money before states were invented

1240
00:21:09,750 --> 00:21:09,760
been money before states were invented
 

1241
00:21:09,760 --> 00:21:12,230
been money before states were invented
um states if you have a government and

1242
00:21:12,230 --> 00:21:12,240
um states if you have a government and
 

1243
00:21:12,240 --> 00:21:14,149
um states if you have a government and
you'd like to have some legitimacy and

1244
00:21:14,149 --> 00:21:14,159
you'd like to have some legitimacy and
 

1245
00:21:14,159 --> 00:21:15,909
you'd like to have some legitimacy and
you'd like to be able to deal with other

1246
00:21:15,909 --> 00:21:15,919
you'd like to be able to deal with other
 

1247
00:21:15,919 --> 00:21:18,310
you'd like to be able to deal with other
governments on an equal footing you had

1248
00:21:18,310 --> 00:21:18,320
governments on an equal footing you had
 

1249
00:21:18,320 --> 00:21:19,990
governments on an equal footing you had
to go by the gold standard you had to

1250
00:21:19,990 --> 00:21:20,000
to go by the gold standard you had to
 

1251
00:21:20,000 --> 00:21:21,510
to go by the gold standard you had to
have a currency that was redeemable in

1252
00:21:21,510 --> 00:21:21,520
have a currency that was redeemable in
 

1253
00:21:21,520 --> 00:21:23,350
have a currency that was redeemable in
gold so that you could trade with the

1254
00:21:23,350 --> 00:21:23,360
gold so that you could trade with the
 

1255
00:21:23,360 --> 00:21:25,110
gold so that you could trade with the
rest of the world so that people could

1256
00:21:25,110 --> 00:21:25,120
rest of the world so that people could
 

1257
00:21:25,120 --> 00:21:28,070
rest of the world so that people could
um in your country use that currency um

1258
00:21:28,070 --> 00:21:28,080
um in your country use that currency um
 

1259
00:21:28,080 --> 00:21:30,390
um in your country use that currency um
so it's it's it's not that governments

1260
00:21:30,390 --> 00:21:30,400
so it's it's it's not that governments
 

1261
00:21:30,400 --> 00:21:32,789
so it's it's it's not that governments
were choosing gold it's more like they

1262
00:21:32,789 --> 00:21:32,799
were choosing gold it's more like they
 

1263
00:21:32,799 --> 00:21:33,669
were choosing gold it's more like they
were

1264
00:21:33,669 --> 00:21:33,679
were
 

1265
00:21:33,679 --> 00:21:37,350
were
having to adapt their own currencies to

1266
00:21:37,350 --> 00:21:37,360
having to adapt their own currencies to
 

1267
00:21:37,360 --> 00:21:38,710
having to adapt their own currencies to
gold in order to give their currencies

1268
00:21:38,710 --> 00:21:38,720
gold in order to give their currencies
 

1269
00:21:38,720 --> 00:21:40,390
gold in order to give their currencies
credibility so there's a dance there

1270
00:21:40,390 --> 00:21:40,400
credibility so there's a dance there
 

1271
00:21:40,400 --> 00:21:43,430
credibility so there's a dance there
though because if they had to

1272
00:21:43,430 --> 00:21:43,440
though because if they had to
 

1273
00:21:43,440 --> 00:21:45,430
though because if they had to
then why did they switch away from it

1274
00:21:45,430 --> 00:21:45,440
then why did they switch away from it
 

1275
00:21:45,440 --> 00:21:46,390
then why did they switch away from it
after

1276
00:21:46,390 --> 00:21:46,400
after
 

1277
00:21:46,400 --> 00:21:47,909
after
so there is a dance where the

1278
00:21:47,909 --> 00:21:47,919
so there is a dance where the
 

1279
00:21:47,919 --> 00:21:49,110
so there is a dance where the
government's

1280
00:21:49,110 --> 00:21:49,120

1281
00:21:49,120 --> 00:21:51,029

00:21:58,559 --> 00:22:00,789
money
pressures the governments and the people

1290
00:22:00,789 --> 00:22:00,799
pressures the governments and the people
 

1291
00:22:00,799 --> 00:22:03,029
pressures the governments and the people
in terms of what should be used then the

00:22:07,110 --> 00:22:07,120
network effects the way they
 

1297
00:22:07,120 --> 00:22:09,110
network effects the way they
the the narratives they tell each other

1298
00:22:09,110 --> 00:22:09,120
the the narratives they tell each other
 

1299
00:22:09,120 --> 00:22:11,110
the the narratives they tell each other
all that kind of stuff they pressure the

1300
00:22:11,110 --> 00:22:11,120
all that kind of stuff they pressure the
 

1301
00:22:11,120 --> 00:22:13,750
all that kind of stuff they pressure the
governments to uh take on a particular

1302
00:22:13,750 --> 00:22:13,760
governments to uh take on a particular
 

1303
00:22:13,760 --> 00:22:15,669
governments to uh take on a particular
money and then the governments

1304
00:22:15,669 --> 00:22:15,679
money and then the governments
 

1305
00:22:15,679 --> 00:22:18,230
money and then the governments
um you know they like power they like

1306
00:22:18,230 --> 00:22:18,240
um you know they like power they like
 

1307
00:22:18,240 --> 00:22:19,830
um you know they like power they like
control all those kinds of things they

1308
00:22:19,830 --> 00:22:19,840
control all those kinds of things they
 

1309
00:22:19,840 --> 00:22:21,510
control all those kinds of things they
pressure the people until different

1310
00:22:21,510 --> 00:22:21,520
pressure the people until different
 

1311
00:22:21,520 --> 00:22:23,029
pressure the people until different
kinds of narratives so there's a dance

1312
00:22:23,029 --> 00:22:23,039
kinds of narratives so there's a dance
 

1313
00:22:23,039 --> 00:22:25,029
kinds of narratives so there's a dance
going on in this evolution of what

1314
00:22:25,029 --> 00:22:25,039
going on in this evolution of what
 

1315
00:22:25,039 --> 00:22:27,190
going on in this evolution of what
technology to use for a monetary system

1316
00:22:27,190 --> 00:22:27,200
technology to use for a monetary system
 

1317
00:22:27,200 --> 00:22:29,190
technology to use for a monetary system
so it's i the reason i

1318
00:22:29,190 --> 00:22:29,200
so it's i the reason i
 

1319
00:22:29,200 --> 00:22:32,230
so it's i the reason i
it i don't know if governments had to

1320
00:22:32,230 --> 00:22:32,240
it i don't know if governments had to
 

1321
00:22:32,240 --> 00:22:34,149
it i don't know if governments had to
because they clearly didn't have to

1322
00:22:34,149 --> 00:22:34,159
because they clearly didn't have to
 

1323
00:22:34,159 --> 00:22:35,830
because they clearly didn't have to
because they eventually moved away from

1324
00:22:35,830 --> 00:22:35,840
because they eventually moved away from
 

1325
00:22:35,840 --> 00:22:36,630
because they eventually moved away from
it

1326
00:22:36,630 --> 00:22:36,640
it
 

1327
00:22:36,640 --> 00:22:38,950
it
so it but there was pressure probably

1328
00:22:38,950 --> 00:22:38,960
so it but there was pressure probably
 

1329
00:22:38,960 --> 00:22:40,390
so it but there was pressure probably
yeah but i mean even after they moved

1330
00:22:40,390 --> 00:22:40,400
yeah but i mean even after they moved
 

1331
00:22:40,400 --> 00:22:41,750
yeah but i mean even after they moved
away from it you know central banks

1332
00:22:41,750 --> 00:22:41,760
away from it you know central banks
 

1333
00:22:41,760 --> 00:22:44,149
away from it you know central banks
until today they still hold a lot of

1334
00:22:44,149 --> 00:22:44,159
until today they still hold a lot of
 

1335
00:22:44,159 --> 00:22:46,549
until today they still hold a lot of
gold reserves in fact if you look at

1336
00:22:46,549 --> 00:22:46,559
gold reserves in fact if you look at
 

1337
00:22:46,559 --> 00:22:49,029
gold reserves in fact if you look at
1914 when they when the world really

1338
00:22:49,029 --> 00:22:49,039
1914 when they when the world really
 

1339
00:22:49,039 --> 00:22:51,029
1914 when they when the world really
went off the gold standard

1340
00:22:51,029 --> 00:22:51,039
went off the gold standard
 

1341
00:22:51,039 --> 00:22:52,950
went off the gold standard
the amount of gold reserves held by

1342
00:22:52,950 --> 00:22:52,960
the amount of gold reserves held by
 

1343
00:22:52,960 --> 00:22:54,870
the amount of gold reserves held by
central banks was a tiny fraction of

1344
00:22:54,870 --> 00:22:54,880
central banks was a tiny fraction of
 

1345
00:22:54,880 --> 00:22:57,590
central banks was a tiny fraction of
what it was as time went on central

1346
00:22:57,590 --> 00:22:57,600
what it was as time went on central
 

1347
00:22:57,600 --> 00:22:59,669
what it was as time went on central
banks accumulated more and more gold

1348
00:22:59,669 --> 00:22:59,679
banks accumulated more and more gold
 

1349
00:22:59,679 --> 00:23:00,950
banks accumulated more and more gold
what ended up happening is they

1350
00:23:00,950 --> 00:23:00,960
what ended up happening is they
 

1351
00:23:00,960 --> 00:23:02,549
what ended up happening is they
prevented their citizens from using the

1352
00:23:02,549 --> 00:23:02,559
prevented their citizens from using the
 

1353
00:23:02,559 --> 00:23:04,310
prevented their citizens from using the
gold but they continued to use it so

1354
00:23:04,310 --> 00:23:04,320
gold but they continued to use it so
 

1355
00:23:04,320 --> 00:23:07,430
gold but they continued to use it so
gold continued to be money up until 1971

1356
00:23:07,430 --> 00:23:07,440
gold continued to be money up until 1971
 

1357
00:23:07,440 --> 00:23:08,789
gold continued to be money up until 1971
because

1358
00:23:08,789 --> 00:23:08,799
because
 

1359
00:23:08,799 --> 00:23:10,230
because
effectively the world was on a dollar

1360
00:23:10,230 --> 00:23:10,240
effectively the world was on a dollar
 

1361
00:23:10,240 --> 00:23:11,990
effectively the world was on a dollar
standard and the dollars were backed by

1362
00:23:11,990 --> 00:23:12,000
standard and the dollars were backed by
 

1363
00:23:12,000 --> 00:23:15,270
standard and the dollars were backed by
gold but then after 1971 even then you

1364
00:23:15,270 --> 00:23:15,280
gold but then after 1971 even then you
 

1365
00:23:15,280 --> 00:23:16,390
gold but then after 1971 even then you
know central banks continue to

1366
00:23:16,390 --> 00:23:16,400
know central banks continue to
 

1367
00:23:16,400 --> 00:23:18,149
know central banks continue to
accumulate gold because

1368
00:23:18,149 --> 00:23:18,159
accumulate gold because
 

1369
00:23:18,159 --> 00:23:19,909
accumulate gold because
why would you as a central central bank

1370
00:23:19,909 --> 00:23:19,919
why would you as a central central bank
 

1371
00:23:19,919 --> 00:23:21,830
why would you as a central central bank
want to accumulate pieces of paper

1372
00:23:21,830 --> 00:23:21,840
want to accumulate pieces of paper
 

1373
00:23:21,840 --> 00:23:23,990
want to accumulate pieces of paper
effectively or credit liabilities of

1374
00:23:23,990 --> 00:23:24,000
effectively or credit liabilities of
 

1375
00:23:24,000 --> 00:23:25,830
effectively or credit liabilities of
another central bank that can produce

1376
00:23:25,830 --> 00:23:25,840
another central bank that can produce
 

1377
00:23:25,840 --> 00:23:27,750
another central bank that can produce
them infinitely

1378
00:23:27,750 --> 00:23:27,760
them infinitely
 

1379
00:23:27,760 --> 00:23:29,430
them infinitely
and it's it's it's a lesson that's

1380
00:23:29,430 --> 00:23:29,440
and it's it's it's a lesson that's
 

1381
00:23:29,440 --> 00:23:32,149
and it's it's it's a lesson that's
becoming uh more and more obvious to

1382
00:23:32,149 --> 00:23:32,159
becoming uh more and more obvious to
 

1383
00:23:32,159 --> 00:23:34,390
becoming uh more and more obvious to
governments today you know as we see u.s

1384
00:23:34,390 --> 00:23:34,400
governments today you know as we see u.s
 

1385
00:23:34,400 --> 00:23:36,549
governments today you know as we see u.s
sanctions taking say russian reserves or

1386
00:23:36,549 --> 00:23:36,559
sanctions taking say russian reserves or
 

1387
00:23:36,559 --> 00:23:38,870
sanctions taking say russian reserves or
afghanistan reserves

1388
00:23:38,870 --> 00:23:38,880
afghanistan reserves
 

1389
00:23:38,880 --> 00:23:40,310
afghanistan reserves
and this is why you know we see china

1390
00:23:40,310 --> 00:23:40,320
and this is why you know we see china
 

1391
00:23:40,320 --> 00:23:41,590
and this is why you know we see china
and russia have accumulated a lot of

1392
00:23:41,590 --> 00:23:41,600
and russia have accumulated a lot of
 

1393
00:23:41,600 --> 00:23:44,390
and russia have accumulated a lot of
gold over the last 10 20 years so just

1394
00:23:44,390 --> 00:23:44,400
gold over the last 10 20 years so just
 

1395
00:23:44,400 --> 00:23:45,269
gold over the last 10 20 years so just
to

1396
00:23:45,269 --> 00:23:45,279
to
 

1397
00:23:45,279 --> 00:23:47,510
to
return to the question of

1398
00:23:47,510 --> 00:23:47,520
return to the question of
 

1399
00:23:47,520 --> 00:23:49,909
return to the question of
definitions so what is hard money versus

1400
00:23:49,909 --> 00:23:49,919
definitions so what is hard money versus
 

1401
00:23:49,919 --> 00:23:52,710
definitions so what is hard money versus
soft money yes so hard i mean it's a

1402
00:23:52,710 --> 00:23:52,720
soft money yes so hard i mean it's a
 

1403
00:23:52,720 --> 00:23:55,190
soft money yes so hard i mean it's a
relative thing but the hardness refers

1404
00:23:55,190 --> 00:23:55,200
relative thing but the hardness refers
 

1405
00:23:55,200 --> 00:23:57,350
relative thing but the hardness refers
to the difficulty of producing more

1406
00:23:57,350 --> 00:23:57,360
to the difficulty of producing more
 

1407
00:23:57,360 --> 00:24:00,630
to the difficulty of producing more
units of the money supply so an easy

1408
00:24:00,630 --> 00:24:00,640
units of the money supply so an easy
 

1409
00:24:00,640 --> 00:24:03,110
units of the money supply so an easy
money would be a money that is um

1410
00:24:03,110 --> 00:24:03,120
money would be a money that is um
 

1411
00:24:03,120 --> 00:24:04,630
money would be a money that is um
relatively easy to make so you can

1412
00:24:04,630 --> 00:24:04,640
relatively easy to make so you can
 

1413
00:24:04,640 --> 00:24:08,710
relatively easy to make so you can
increase the supply by 10 20 30 40 50 or

1414
00:24:08,710 --> 00:24:08,720
increase the supply by 10 20 30 40 50 or
 

1415
00:24:08,720 --> 00:24:10,710
increase the supply by 10 20 30 40 50 or
something like that so pretty much all

1416
00:24:10,710 --> 00:24:10,720
something like that so pretty much all
 

1417
00:24:10,720 --> 00:24:12,630
something like that so pretty much all
commodities all market commodities other

1418
00:24:12,630 --> 00:24:12,640
commodities all market commodities other
 

1419
00:24:12,640 --> 00:24:14,230
commodities all market commodities other
than gold and silver

1420
00:24:14,230 --> 00:24:14,240
than gold and silver
 

1421
00:24:14,240 --> 00:24:16,310
than gold and silver
they're easy money and they're not

1422
00:24:16,310 --> 00:24:16,320
they're easy money and they're not
 

1423
00:24:16,320 --> 00:24:18,950
they're easy money and they're not
suitable as a monetary medium because

1424
00:24:18,950 --> 00:24:18,960
suitable as a monetary medium because
 

1425
00:24:18,960 --> 00:24:20,870
suitable as a monetary medium because
they're being consumed so if you look at

1426
00:24:20,870 --> 00:24:20,880
they're being consumed so if you look at
 

1427
00:24:20,880 --> 00:24:22,549
they're being consumed so if you look at
on in the bitcoin standard i mentioned

1428
00:24:22,549 --> 00:24:22,559
on in the bitcoin standard i mentioned
 

1429
00:24:22,559 --> 00:24:24,149
on in the bitcoin standard i mentioned
this metric called the stock to flow

1430
00:24:24,149 --> 00:24:24,159
this metric called the stock to flow
 

1431
00:24:24,159 --> 00:24:27,110
this metric called the stock to flow
ratio which is the ratio of the annual

1432
00:24:27,110 --> 00:24:27,120
ratio which is the ratio of the annual
 

1433
00:24:27,120 --> 00:24:28,710
ratio which is the ratio of the annual
production the flow

1434
00:24:28,710 --> 00:24:28,720
production the flow
 

1435
00:24:28,720 --> 00:24:31,269
production the flow
to the stockpile the existing stockpiles

1436
00:24:31,269 --> 00:24:31,279
to the stockpile the existing stockpiles
 

1437
00:24:31,279 --> 00:24:32,950
to the stockpile the existing stockpiles
if you look at all the other metals

1438
00:24:32,950 --> 00:24:32,960
if you look at all the other metals
 

1439
00:24:32,960 --> 00:24:35,430
if you look at all the other metals
they're easy money because they're being

1440
00:24:35,430 --> 00:24:35,440
they're easy money because they're being
 

1441
00:24:35,440 --> 00:24:37,110
they're easy money because they're being
consumed so think about how much

1442
00:24:37,110 --> 00:24:37,120
consumed so think about how much
 

1443
00:24:37,120 --> 00:24:38,870
consumed so think about how much
stockpiles of copper there are in the

1444
00:24:38,870 --> 00:24:38,880
stockpiles of copper there are in the
 

1445
00:24:38,880 --> 00:24:40,950
stockpiles of copper there are in the
world today so copper companies

1446
00:24:40,950 --> 00:24:40,960
world today so copper companies
 

1447
00:24:40,960 --> 00:24:43,990
world today so copper companies
obviously have some stockpiles of copper

1448
00:24:43,990 --> 00:24:44,000
obviously have some stockpiles of copper
 

1449
00:24:44,000 --> 00:24:45,510
obviously have some stockpiles of copper
major copper consumers will have

1450
00:24:45,510 --> 00:24:45,520
major copper consumers will have
 

1451
00:24:45,520 --> 00:24:47,350
major copper consumers will have
stockpiles of copper but the vast

1452
00:24:47,350 --> 00:24:47,360
stockpiles of copper but the vast
 

1453
00:24:47,360 --> 00:24:50,789
stockpiles of copper but the vast
majority of copper is essentially on a

1454
00:24:50,789 --> 00:24:50,799
majority of copper is essentially on a
 

1455
00:24:50,799 --> 00:24:53,110
majority of copper is essentially on a
on a conveyor belt of production

1456
00:24:53,110 --> 00:24:53,120
on a conveyor belt of production
 

1457
00:24:53,120 --> 00:24:55,830
on a conveyor belt of production
from the mine straight to the uh

1458
00:24:55,830 --> 00:24:55,840
from the mine straight to the uh
 

1459
00:24:55,840 --> 00:24:58,390
from the mine straight to the uh
consumer good that it's being used for

1460
00:24:58,390 --> 00:24:58,400
consumer good that it's being used for
 

1461
00:24:58,400 --> 00:24:59,350
consumer good that it's being used for
so

1462
00:24:59,350 --> 00:24:59,360
so
 

1463
00:24:59,360 --> 00:25:01,830
so
the existing stockpiles are roughly in

1464
00:25:01,830 --> 00:25:01,840
the existing stockpiles are roughly in
 

1465
00:25:01,840 --> 00:25:03,430
the existing stockpiles are roughly in
the range of

1466
00:25:03,430 --> 00:25:03,440
the range of
 

1467
00:25:03,440 --> 00:25:05,430
the range of
one year's production if you take all of

1468
00:25:05,430 --> 00:25:05,440
one year's production if you take all of
 

1469
00:25:05,440 --> 00:25:07,430
one year's production if you take all of
the companies i i don't have exact

1470
00:25:07,430 --> 00:25:07,440
the companies i i don't have exact
 

1471
00:25:07,440 --> 00:25:09,110
the companies i i don't have exact
statistics

1472
00:25:09,110 --> 00:25:09,120
statistics
 

1473
00:25:09,120 --> 00:25:10,710
statistics
it's very difficult to get these but you

1474
00:25:10,710 --> 00:25:10,720
it's very difficult to get these but you
 

1475
00:25:10,720 --> 00:25:12,789
it's very difficult to get these but you
know it's roughly in the same range like

1476
00:25:12,789 --> 00:25:12,799
know it's roughly in the same range like
 

1477
00:25:12,799 --> 00:25:15,350
know it's roughly in the same range like
if copper production were to stop

1478
00:25:15,350 --> 00:25:15,360
if copper production were to stop
 

1479
00:25:15,360 --> 00:25:17,190
if copper production were to stop
completely today

1480
00:25:17,190 --> 00:25:17,200
completely today
 

1481
00:25:17,200 --> 00:25:19,430
completely today
we'll have about a year's production

1482
00:25:19,430 --> 00:25:19,440
we'll have about a year's production
 

1483
00:25:19,440 --> 00:25:21,909
we'll have about a year's production
stored in various places

1484
00:25:21,909 --> 00:25:21,919
stored in various places
 

1485
00:25:21,919 --> 00:25:24,549
stored in various places
so that makes copper terrible money

1486
00:25:24,549 --> 00:25:24,559
so that makes copper terrible money
 

1487
00:25:24,559 --> 00:25:26,630
so that makes copper terrible money
because if you started using copper as

1488
00:25:26,630 --> 00:25:26,640
because if you started using copper as
 

1489
00:25:26,640 --> 00:25:28,390
because if you started using copper as
money and this is why you know a lot of

1490
00:25:28,390 --> 00:25:28,400
money and this is why you know a lot of
 

1491
00:25:28,400 --> 00:25:29,990
money and this is why you know a lot of
people say well money is a collective

1492
00:25:29,990 --> 00:25:30,000
people say well money is a collective
 

1493
00:25:30,000 --> 00:25:32,149
people say well money is a collective
illusion money is a

1494
00:25:32,149 --> 00:25:32,159
illusion money is a
 

1495
00:25:32,159 --> 00:25:35,190
illusion money is a
social construct um if we all agree that

1496
00:25:35,190 --> 00:25:35,200
social construct um if we all agree that
 

1497
00:25:35,200 --> 00:25:36,230
social construct um if we all agree that
something is money then something is

1498
00:25:36,230 --> 00:25:36,240
something is money then something is
 

1499
00:25:36,240 --> 00:25:37,750
something is money then something is
money i think it's completely clueless

1500
00:25:37,750 --> 00:25:37,760
money i think it's completely clueless
 

1501
00:25:37,760 --> 00:25:39,430
money i think it's completely clueless
and it's usually marxists who believe

1502
00:25:39,430 --> 00:25:39,440
and it's usually marxists who believe
 

1503
00:25:39,440 --> 00:25:41,269
and it's usually marxists who believe
this so obviously no understanding of

1504
00:25:41,269 --> 00:25:41,279
this so obviously no understanding of
 

1505
00:25:41,279 --> 00:25:43,269
this so obviously no understanding of
economics it's completely clueless

economics it's completely clueless
 

1507
00:25:43,279 --> 00:25:45,510
economics it's completely clueless
because even if everybody in society

1508
00:25:45,510 --> 00:25:45,520
because even if everybody in society
 

1509
00:25:45,520 --> 00:25:47,430
because even if everybody in society
decided we wanted to make copper as

1510
00:25:47,430 --> 00:25:47,440
decided we wanted to make copper as
 

1511
00:25:47,440 --> 00:25:48,789
decided we wanted to make copper as
money even if we all decided to

take part in this hallucination or

take part in this hallucination or
 

1517
00:25:52,240 --> 00:25:53,190
take part in this hallucination or

illusion
 

1519
00:25:53,200 --> 00:25:55,190
illusion
it would not make copper money it would

1520
00:25:55,190 --> 00:25:55,200
it would not make copper money it would
 

1521
00:25:55,200 --> 00:25:56,870
it would not make copper money it would
just make everybody who decides to take

1522
00:25:56,870 --> 00:25:56,880
just make everybody who decides to take
 

1523
00:25:56,880 --> 00:25:58,950
just make everybody who decides to take
part in this hallucination poor that's

1524
00:25:58,950 --> 00:25:58,960
part in this hallucination poor that's
 

1525
00:25:58,960 --> 00:26:01,029
part in this hallucination poor that's
it it would make copper miners rich it

1526
00:26:01,029 --> 00:26:01,039
it it would make copper miners rich it
 

1527
00:26:01,039 --> 00:26:02,549
it it would make copper miners rich it
would make all of the people who chose

1528
00:26:02,549 --> 00:26:02,559
would make all of the people who chose
 

1529
00:26:02,559 --> 00:26:04,630
would make all of the people who chose
copper as money poor and copper would

1530
00:26:04,630 --> 00:26:04,640
copper as money poor and copper would
 

1531
00:26:04,640 --> 00:26:07,029
copper as money poor and copper would
not be money it can't work because what

1532
00:26:07,029 --> 00:26:07,039
not be money it can't work because what
 

1533
00:26:07,039 --> 00:26:08,549
not be money it can't work because what
happens is because of the fact that the

1534
00:26:08,549 --> 00:26:08,559
happens is because of the fact that the
 

1535
00:26:08,559 --> 00:26:11,029
happens is because of the fact that the
stockpiles are so small if you buy you

1536
00:26:11,029 --> 00:26:11,039
stockpiles are so small if you buy you
 

1537
00:26:11,039 --> 00:26:13,269
stockpiles are so small if you buy you
know even if you get the 1 000 richest

1538
00:26:13,269 --> 00:26:13,279
know even if you get the 1 000 richest
 

1539

billionaires
 

1543
00:26:16,159 --> 00:26:18,070
billionaires
they get together they all

1544
00:26:18,070 --> 00:26:18,080
they get together they all
 

1545
00:26:18,080 --> 00:26:19,750
they get together they all
dump all of the money that they have all

1546
00:26:19,750 --> 00:26:19,760
dump all of the money that they have all
 

1547
00:26:19,760 --> 00:26:21,990
dump all of the money that they have all
the stocks all the bonds all the

gold all of the bitcoin everything that
they own they dump it and they buy

1552
00:26:26,230 --> 00:26:26,240
they own they dump it and they buy
 

1553
00:26:26,240 --> 00:26:28,390
they own they dump it and they buy
copper with it what's gonna happen price

1554
00:26:28,390 --> 00:26:28,400
copper with it what's gonna happen price
 

1555
00:26:28,400 --> 00:26:30,710
copper with it what's gonna happen price
of copper is gonna go up a lot

1556
00:26:30,710 --> 00:26:30,720
of copper is gonna go up a lot
 

1557
00:26:30,720 --> 00:26:33,269
of copper is gonna go up a lot
but what's gonna stop copper miners from

1558
00:26:33,269 --> 00:26:33,279
but what's gonna stop copper miners from
 

1559
00:26:33,279 --> 00:26:35,510
but what's gonna stop copper miners from
flooding the market with even more

1560
00:26:35,510 --> 00:26:35,520
flooding the market with even more
 

1561
00:26:35,520 --> 00:26:37,669
flooding the market with even more
copper than what the billionaires bought

1562
00:26:37,669 --> 00:26:37,679
copper than what the billionaires bought
 

1563
00:26:37,679 --> 00:26:39,350
copper than what the billionaires bought
nothing they're going to dump all of

1564
00:26:39,350 --> 00:26:39,360
nothing they're going to dump all of
 

1565
00:26:39,360 --> 00:26:40,149
nothing they're going to dump all of
that

1566
00:26:40,149 --> 00:26:40,159
that
 

1567
00:26:40,159 --> 00:26:42,230
that
extra copper production if the price of

1568
00:26:42,230 --> 00:26:42,240
extra copper production if the price of
 

1569
00:26:42,240 --> 00:26:43,510
extra copper production if the price of
copper is going to go up so you know

1570
00:26:43,510 --> 00:26:43,520
copper is going to go up so you know
 

1571
00:26:43,520 --> 00:26:45,510
copper is going to go up so you know
there will be a lot more copper mining

1572
00:26:45,510 --> 00:26:45,520
there will be a lot more copper mining
 

1573
00:26:45,520 --> 00:26:48,070
there will be a lot more copper mining
than all the other metals a lot of

1574
00:26:48,070 --> 00:26:48,080
than all the other metals a lot of
 

1575
00:26:48,080 --> 00:26:50,230
than all the other metals a lot of
you know nickel companies and gold

1576
00:26:50,230 --> 00:26:50,240
you know nickel companies and gold
 

1577
00:26:50,240 --> 00:26:52,149
you know nickel companies and gold
miners are going to switch to focusing

1578
00:26:52,149 --> 00:26:52,159
miners are going to switch to focusing
 

1579
00:26:52,159 --> 00:26:53,350
miners are going to switch to focusing
on copper

1580
00:26:53,350 --> 00:26:53,360
on copper
 

1581
00:26:53,360 --> 00:26:55,269
on copper
and then we're going to dump an enormous

1582
00:26:55,269 --> 00:26:55,279
and then we're going to dump an enormous
 

1583
00:26:55,279 --> 00:26:57,350
and then we're going to dump an enormous
amount of copper on the market the value

1584
00:26:57,350 --> 00:26:57,360
amount of copper on the market the value
 

1585
00:26:57,360 --> 00:26:58,870
amount of copper on the market the value
of copper is going to crash

1586
00:26:58,870 --> 00:26:58,880
of copper is going to crash
 

1587
00:26:58,880 --> 00:27:01,430
of copper is going to crash
and the people who chose copper as money

1588
00:27:01,430 --> 00:27:01,440
and the people who chose copper as money
 

1589
00:27:01,440 --> 00:27:02,630
and the people who chose copper as money
are just going to end up with large

1590
00:27:02,630 --> 00:27:02,640
are just going to end up with large
 

1591
00:27:02,640 --> 00:27:06,310
are just going to end up with large
warehouses of very cheap rusting metal

1592
00:27:06,310 --> 00:27:06,320
warehouses of very cheap rusting metal
 

1593
00:27:06,320 --> 00:27:07,909
warehouses of very cheap rusting metal
so that's a brilliant description and

1594
00:27:07,909 --> 00:27:07,919
so that's a brilliant description and
 

1595
00:27:07,919 --> 00:27:09,830
so that's a brilliant description and
that that kind of pushes towards gold

1596
00:27:09,830 --> 00:27:09,840
that that kind of pushes towards gold
 

1597
00:27:09,840 --> 00:27:10,789
that that kind of pushes towards gold
where the

1598
00:27:10,789 --> 00:27:10,799
where the
 

1599
00:27:10,799 --> 00:27:13,669
where the
um stock to flow ratio i guess you would

1600
00:27:13,669 --> 00:27:13,679
um stock to flow ratio i guess you would
 

1601
00:27:13,679 --> 00:27:15,990
um stock to flow ratio i guess you would
say is 1.5 to 2 like you mentioned

1602
00:27:15,990 --> 00:27:16,000
say is 1.5 to 2 like you mentioned
 

1603
00:27:16,000 --> 00:27:17,590
say is 1.5 to 2 like you mentioned
earlier well that would be like the

1604
00:27:17,590 --> 00:27:17,600
earlier well that would be like the
 

1605
00:27:17,600 --> 00:27:18,870
earlier well that would be like the
inverse of the stock to flow that's the

1606
00:27:18,870 --> 00:27:18,880
inverse of the stock to flow that's the
 

1607
00:27:18,880 --> 00:27:20,630
inverse of the stock to flow that's the
supply growth rate so the stock to flow

1608
00:27:20,630 --> 00:27:20,640
supply growth rate so the stock to flow
 

1609
00:27:20,640 --> 00:27:22,470
supply growth rate so the stock to flow
is the inverse it's around 60.

1610
00:27:22,470 --> 00:27:22,480
is the inverse it's around 60.
 

1611
00:27:22,480 --> 00:27:25,909
is the inverse it's around 60.

you're smarter than me and all this
stuff so if we we want the smartest

1738
00:29:31,350 --> 00:29:31,360
stuff so if we we want the smartest
 

1739
00:29:31,360 --> 00:29:33,350
stuff so if we we want the smartest
devil's advocate possible

1740
00:29:33,350 --> 00:29:33,360
devil's advocate possible
 

1741
00:29:33,360 --> 00:29:35,669
devil's advocate possible
and i'm certainly not that but anyway so

1742
00:29:35,669 --> 00:29:35,679
and i'm certainly not that but anyway so
 

1743
00:29:35,679 --> 00:29:39,269
and i'm certainly not that but anyway so
but nevertheless we are currently

1744
00:29:39,269 --> 00:29:39,279
but nevertheless we are currently
 

1745
00:29:39,279 --> 00:29:41,430
but nevertheless we are currently
on the fiat standard

1746
00:29:41,430 --> 00:29:41,440
on the fiat standard
 

1747
00:29:41,440 --> 00:29:43,029
on the fiat standard
so

1748
00:29:43,029 --> 00:29:43,039
so
 

1749
00:29:43,039 --> 00:29:44,310
so

1763
00:29:54,559 --> 00:29:57,669

we put the hallucination word aside

1764
00:29:57,669 --> 00:29:57,679
we put the hallucination word aside
 

1765
00:29:57,679 --> 00:30:01,110

the belief that something is worth value
is actually

1768
00:30:03,029 --> 00:30:03,039
is actually
 

1769
00:30:03,039 --> 00:30:05,110
is actually
value and is the thing that helps money

1770

and the belief
 

1777
00:30:11,440 --> 00:30:14,710
and the belief
is almost valueless but how much value

1778
00:30:14,710 --> 00:30:14,720
is almost valueless but how much value
 

1779
00:30:14,720 --> 00:30:17,190
is almost valueless but how much value
can we quantify the value of the belief

1780
00:30:17,190 --> 00:30:17,200
can we quantify the value of the belief
 

1781
00:30:17,200 --> 00:30:19,830
can we quantify the value of the belief

that's true there's so you're drawing a
 

1833
00:31:04,159 --> 00:31:07,269
that's true there's so you're drawing a
big distinction between physical reality

1834
00:31:07,269 --> 00:31:07,279
big distinction between physical reality
 

1835
00:31:07,279 --> 00:31:09,750
big distinction between physical reality
and the space of belief but it seems

1837
00:31:09,760 --> 00:31:11,909
and the space of belief but it seems
like so much power

1838
00:31:11,909 --> 00:31:11,919
like so much power
 

1839
00:31:11,919 --> 00:31:14,070
like so much power
of human civilization

1840
00:31:14,070 --> 00:31:14,080
of human civilization
 

1841
00:31:14,080 --> 00:31:16,830
of human civilization
uh so much destruction so much

1842
00:31:16,830 --> 00:31:16,840
uh so much destruction so much
 

1843

minds
 

1847
00:31:21,120 --> 00:31:23,029
minds
so absolutely everything does happen in

moon but you might still have a
 

1853
00:31:26,559 --> 00:31:29,190
moon but you might still have a
significant impact on human civilization

significant impact on human civilization
 

1855
00:31:29,200 --> 00:31:31,430
significant impact on human civilization
if a lot of people believe a thing

1856
00:31:31,430 --> 00:31:31,440
if a lot of people believe a thing

to get to the moon
 

1871
00:31:46,399 --> 00:31:47,909
to get to the moon
you know and that solves the problem of

1872
00:31:47,909 --> 00:31:47,919
you know and that solves the problem of
 

1873
00:31:47,919 --> 00:31:49,110
you know and that solves the problem of
people thinking the bananas are

1874

people thinking the bananas are
 

1875
00:31:49,120 --> 00:31:51,430
people thinking the bananas are
spaceships by killing people who think

1876
00:31:51,430 --> 00:31:51,440
spaceships by killing people who think
 

1877
00:31:51,440 --> 00:31:53,750
spaceships by killing people who think
that bananas are spaceships and i think

1878
00:31:53,750 --> 00:31:53,760
that bananas are spaceships and i think
 

1879
00:31:53,760 --> 00:31:55,190
that bananas are spaceships and i think
to go back to your question on in terms

00:31:55,190 --> 00:31:55,200
to go back to your question on in terms
 

1881
00:31:55,200 --> 00:31:57,350
to go back to your question on in terms
of paper monies so yes even though you

um
the original sin of the creation of fiat

1888
00:32:02,389 --> 00:32:02,399
the original sin of the creation of fiat
 

1889
00:32:02,399 --> 00:32:03,990
the original sin of the creation of fiat
money and ignoring everything that

money and ignoring everything that
 

1891
00:32:04,000 --> 00:32:06,149
money and ignoring everything that
happened before 1971 all right well here

1892
00:32:06,149 --> 00:32:06,159
happened before 1971 all right well here
 

1893
00:32:06,159 --> 00:32:08,230

we are people are using well it's not
 

1895
00:32:08,240 --> 00:32:09,750
we are people are using well it's not
really paper money and we should say

1896
00:32:09,750 --> 00:32:09,760
really paper money and we should say
 

1897
00:32:09,760 --> 00:32:10,549
really paper money and we should say
like

like
 

1899
00:32:10,559 --> 00:32:12,950
like
fiat money is predominantly credit so

fiat money is predominantly credit so
 

1901
00:32:12,960 --> 00:32:15,590
fiat money is predominantly credit so
like the it's also digital currency so

1902
00:32:15,590 --> 00:32:15,600
like the it's also digital currency so
 

1903
00:32:15,600 --> 00:32:17,909
like the it's also digital currency so
more than 90 percent of dollars

1904

more than 90 percent of dollars
 

1905
00:32:17,919 --> 00:32:19,830
more than 90 percent of dollars
are digital less than 10 percent of

are digital less than 10 percent of
 

1907
00:32:19,840 --> 00:32:22,070
are digital less than 10 percent of
dollars are physical so it is a digital

1908
00:32:22,070 --> 00:32:22,080
dollars are physical so it is a digital
 

1909
00:32:22,080 --> 00:32:23,990
dollars are physical so it is a digital
currency and all over the world all

1910
00:32:23,990 --> 00:32:24,000
currency and all over the world all
 

1911
00:32:24,000 --> 00:32:25,350
currency and all over the world all
these governments are using digital

1912
00:32:25,350 --> 00:32:25,360
these governments are using digital
 

1913
00:32:25,360 --> 00:32:27,029
these governments are using digital
currencies effectively with some

1914
00:32:27,029 --> 00:32:27,039
currencies effectively with some
 

1915
00:32:27,039 --> 00:32:29,350
currencies effectively with some
physical manifestations in paper

1916
00:32:29,350 --> 00:32:29,360
physical manifestations in paper
 

1917
00:32:29,360 --> 00:32:31,509
physical manifestations in paper
but yet even within these

1918
00:32:31,509 --> 00:32:31,519
but yet even within these
 

1919
00:32:31,519 --> 00:32:33,590
but yet even within these
currencies it's still the same analysis

1920
00:32:33,590 --> 00:32:33,600
currencies it's still the same analysis
 

1921
00:32:33,600 --> 00:32:35,029
currencies it's still the same analysis
and i discussed this in chapter four of

1922
00:32:35,029 --> 00:32:35,039
and i discussed this in chapter four of
 

1923
00:32:35,039 --> 00:32:36,549
and i discussed this in chapter four of
the bitcoin standard you look at

1924
00:32:36,549 --> 00:32:36,559
the bitcoin standard you look at
 

1925
00:32:36,559 --> 00:32:38,230
the bitcoin standard you look at
government monies you see that the

1926
00:32:38,230 --> 00:32:38,240
government monies you see that the
 

1927
00:32:38,240 --> 00:32:39,590
government monies you see that the
currencies that have held on to their

1928
00:32:39,590 --> 00:32:39,600
currencies that have held on to their
 

1929
00:32:39,600 --> 00:32:41,590
currencies that have held on to their
value the ones that have the biggest

1930
00:32:41,590 --> 00:32:41,600
value the ones that have the biggest
 

1931
00:32:41,600 --> 00:32:43,190
value the ones that have the biggest
value the ones that play the biggest

00:32:52,470 --> 00:32:52,480
the ones that grow
 

1943
00:32:52,480 --> 00:32:53,990

whose central banks are the least

1944
00:32:53,990 --> 00:32:54,000
whose central banks are the least
 

1945

inflationary
 

1947
00:32:55,279 --> 00:32:57,269
inflationary
and on the other hand the ones that

1948
00:32:57,269 --> 00:32:57,279
and on the other hand the ones that
 

1949
00:32:57,279 --> 00:32:58,789
and on the other hand the ones that
whose supply is more inflationary

1950
00:32:58,789 --> 00:32:58,799
whose supply is more inflationary
 

1951
00:32:58,799 --> 00:33:00,870
whose supply is more inflationary
similar to copper end up failing you

1952
00:33:00,870 --> 00:33:00,880
similar to copper end up failing you
 

1953
00:33:00,880 --> 00:33:03,509
similar to copper end up failing you
look at lebanon venezuela zimbabwe these

1954
00:33:03,509 --> 00:33:03,519
look at lebanon venezuela zimbabwe these
 

1955
00:33:03,519 --> 00:33:04,950
look at lebanon venezuela zimbabwe these
are currencies whose supply increases

1956
00:33:04,950 --> 00:33:04,960
are currencies whose supply increases
 

1957
00:33:04,960 --> 00:33:06,389
are currencies whose supply increases
very quickly

1958
00:33:06,389 --> 00:33:06,399
very quickly
 

1959
00:33:06,399 --> 00:33:07,750
very quickly
and therefore

1960
00:33:07,750 --> 00:33:07,760
and therefore
 

1961
00:33:07,760 --> 00:33:10,230
and therefore
their value collapses whereas the dollar

1962
00:33:10,230 --> 00:33:10,240
their value collapses whereas the dollar
 

1963
00:33:10,240 --> 00:33:12,389
their value collapses whereas the dollar
the swiss franc the euro

1964
00:33:12,389 --> 00:33:12,399
the swiss franc the euro
 

1965
00:33:12,399 --> 00:33:15,110
the swiss franc the euro
the british pound the japanese yen they

1966
00:33:15,110 --> 00:33:15,120
the british pound the japanese yen they
 

1967
00:33:15,120 --> 00:33:17,110
the british pound the japanese yen they
increase at a much lower rate in general

1968
00:33:17,110 --> 00:33:17,120
increase at a much lower rate in general
 

1969
00:33:17,120 --> 00:33:19,669
increase at a much lower rate in general
than the uh than these terrible

1970
00:33:19,669 --> 00:33:19,679
than the uh than these terrible
 

1971
00:33:19,679 --> 00:33:21,190
than the uh than these terrible
currencies and that's why

1972
00:33:21,190 --> 00:33:21,200
currencies and that's why
 

1973
00:33:21,200 --> 00:33:22,470
currencies and that's why
all over the world you see people are

1974
00:33:22,470 --> 00:33:22,480
all over the world you see people are
 

1975
00:33:22,480 --> 00:33:24,950
all over the world you see people are
looking to get more dollars and more of

1976
00:33:24,950 --> 00:33:24,960
looking to get more dollars and more of
 

1977
00:33:24,960 --> 00:33:27,830
looking to get more dollars and more of
these harder currencies than the easier

1978
00:33:27,830 --> 00:33:27,840
these harder currencies than the easier
 

1979
00:33:27,840 --> 00:33:31,110
these harder currencies than the easier
ones so i think this analysis of

1980
00:33:31,110 --> 00:33:31,120
ones so i think this analysis of
 

1981
00:33:31,120 --> 00:33:32,710
ones so i think this analysis of
the hardness of the money and the ease

1982
00:33:32,710 --> 00:33:32,720
the hardness of the money and the ease
 

1983
00:33:32,720 --> 00:33:35,430
the hardness of the money and the ease
of money is

1984
00:33:35,430 --> 00:33:35,440
of money is
 

1985
00:33:35,440 --> 00:33:37,509
of money is
pretty well supported empirically

1986
00:33:37,509 --> 00:33:37,519
pretty well supported empirically
 

1987
00:33:37,519 --> 00:33:39,509
pretty well supported empirically
so like you said

1988
00:33:39,509 --> 00:33:39,519
so like you said
 

1989
00:33:39,519 --> 00:33:41,669
so like you said
you're at least in part or in whole

1990
00:33:41,669 --> 00:33:41,679
you're at least in part or in whole
 

1991
00:33:41,679 --> 00:33:44,710
you're at least in part or in whole
consider yourself an austrian economist

1992
00:33:44,710 --> 00:33:44,720
consider yourself an austrian economist
 

1993
00:33:44,720 --> 00:33:45,430
consider yourself an austrian economist
so

1994
00:33:45,430 --> 00:33:45,440
so
 

1995
00:33:45,440 --> 00:33:47,430
so
you're perhaps a great person to ask

1996
00:33:47,430 --> 00:33:47,440
you're perhaps a great person to ask
 

1997
00:33:47,440 --> 00:33:48,870
you're perhaps a great person to ask
about the basics

1998
00:33:48,870 --> 00:33:48,880
about the basics
 

1999
00:33:48,880 --> 00:33:50,789
about the basics
what is austrian economics what is

2000
00:33:50,789 --> 00:33:50,799
what is austrian economics what is
 

2001
00:33:50,799 --> 00:33:53,750
what is austrian economics what is
kenzian economic how do you compare the

2002
00:33:53,750 --> 00:33:53,760
kenzian economic how do you compare the
 

2003
00:33:53,760 --> 00:33:54,549
kenzian economic how do you compare the
two

2004
00:33:54,549 --> 00:33:54,559
two
 

2005
00:33:54,559 --> 00:33:56,389
two
what should people know some interest

2006
00:33:56,389 --> 00:33:56,399
what should people know some interest
 

2007
00:33:56,399 --> 00:33:57,430
what should people know some interest
what are

2008
00:33:57,430 --> 00:33:57,440
what are
 

2009
00:33:57,440 --> 00:33:59,669
what are
interesting defining characteristics to

2010
00:33:59,669 --> 00:33:59,679
interesting defining characteristics to
 

2011
00:33:59,679 --> 00:34:01,590
interesting defining characteristics to
you about these schools yeah

2012
00:34:01,590 --> 00:34:01,600
you about these schools yeah
 

2013
00:34:01,600 --> 00:34:03,029
you about these schools yeah
so austrian economics the way that i

2014
00:34:03,029 --> 00:34:03,039
so austrian economics the way that i
 

2015
00:34:03,039 --> 00:34:04,870
so austrian economics the way that i
said austrian economics is economics

2016
00:34:04,870 --> 00:34:04,880
said austrian economics is economics
 

2017
00:34:04,880 --> 00:34:07,590
said austrian economics is economics
it's um it we call it austrian economics

2018
00:34:07,590 --> 00:34:07,600
it's um it we call it austrian economics
 

2019
00:34:07,600 --> 00:34:10,149
it's um it we call it austrian economics
because economics has been hijacked by a

2020
00:34:10,149 --> 00:34:10,159
because economics has been hijacked by a
 

2021
00:34:10,159 --> 00:34:11,909
because economics has been hijacked by a
bunch of frauds really people who are

2022
00:34:11,909 --> 00:34:11,919
bunch of frauds really people who are
 

2023
00:34:11,919 --> 00:34:12,790
bunch of frauds really people who are
wrong

wrong
 

2025
00:34:12,800 --> 00:34:14,629
wrong
well it's much worse than wrong by

2026
00:34:14,629 --> 00:34:14,639
well it's much worse than wrong by
 

2027
00:34:14,639 --> 00:34:15,750
well it's much worse than wrong by
people who are just essentially

2028
00:34:15,750 --> 00:34:15,760
people who are just essentially
 

2029
00:34:15,760 --> 00:34:18,629
people who are just essentially
propagandists for inflation right um so

krugman on this podcast so he's uh

2042
00:34:31,510 --> 00:34:31,520
krugman on this podcast so he's uh
 

2043

the o speaks enough but he is uh he's
 

2045
00:34:34,079 --> 00:34:36,790
the o speaks enough but he is uh he's
one of the people that is perhaps most

2046
00:34:36,790 --> 00:34:36,800
one of the people that is perhaps most
 

2047
00:34:36,800 --> 00:34:39,829
one of the people that is perhaps most
harshly criticized by folks

2048
00:34:39,829 --> 00:34:39,839
harshly criticized by folks
 

2049
00:34:39,839 --> 00:34:40,790
harshly criticized by folks
in

2050
00:34:40,790 --> 00:34:40,800
in
 

2051
00:34:40,800 --> 00:34:43,510
in
austrian economics perspective and vice

2052
00:34:43,510 --> 00:34:43,520
austrian economics perspective and vice
 

2053
00:34:43,520 --> 00:34:45,669
austrian economics perspective and vice
versa which is a fascinating intention

2054
00:34:45,669 --> 00:34:45,679
versa which is a fascinating intention
 

2055
00:34:45,679 --> 00:34:48,550
versa which is a fascinating intention
yeah he's um he's done a great job as an

2056
00:34:48,550 --> 00:34:48,560
yeah he's um he's done a great job as an
 

2057
00:34:48,560 --> 00:34:50,310
yeah he's um he's done a great job as an
actor who plays an economist on tv and

2058
00:34:50,310 --> 00:34:50,320
actor who plays an economist on tv and
 

2059
00:34:50,320 --> 00:34:52,310
actor who plays an economist on tv and
the internet

2060
00:34:52,310 --> 00:34:52,320
the internet
 

2061
00:34:52,320 --> 00:34:54,629
the internet
so anyway uh now tell me what you really

2062
00:34:54,629 --> 00:34:54,639
so anyway uh now tell me what you really
 

2063
00:34:54,639 --> 00:34:57,510
so anyway uh now tell me what you really
think no but so the basics of what is

2064
00:34:57,510 --> 00:34:57,520
think no but so the basics of what is
 

2065
00:34:57,520 --> 00:34:59,109
think no but so the basics of what is
austrian economics what is the what

2066
00:34:59,109 --> 00:34:59,119
austrian economics what is the what
 

2067
00:34:59,119 --> 00:35:00,550
austrian economics what is the what
perspective does it take in the world

2068
00:35:00,550 --> 00:35:00,560
perspective does it take in the world
 

2069
00:35:00,560 --> 00:35:02,550
perspective does it take in the world
yeah so i mean austrian economics really

2070
00:35:02,550 --> 00:35:02,560
yeah so i mean austrian economics really
 

2071
00:35:02,560 --> 00:35:03,589
yeah so i mean austrian economics really
is

2072
00:35:03,589 --> 00:35:03,599
is
 

2073
00:35:03,599 --> 00:35:06,069
is
uh the continuation of a tradition that

2074
00:35:06,069 --> 00:35:06,079
uh the continuation of a tradition that
 

2075
00:35:06,079 --> 00:35:08,470
uh the continuation of a tradition that
it goes back to the ancient greeks of

2076
00:35:08,470 --> 00:35:08,480
it goes back to the ancient greeks of
 

2077
00:35:08,480 --> 00:35:11,109
it goes back to the ancient greeks of
studying economics historically it's

2078
00:35:11,109 --> 00:35:11,119
studying economics historically it's
 

2079
00:35:11,119 --> 00:35:12,390
studying economics historically it's
really just

2080
00:35:12,390 --> 00:35:12,400
really just
 

2081
00:35:12,400 --> 00:35:14,550
really just
economics and that has evolved over time

2082
00:35:14,550 --> 00:35:14,560
economics and that has evolved over time
 

2083
00:35:14,560 --> 00:35:15,589
economics and that has evolved over time
and the

2084
00:35:15,589 --> 00:35:15,599
and the
 

2085
00:35:15,599 --> 00:35:17,109
and the
um

2086
00:35:17,109 --> 00:35:17,119
um
 

2087
00:35:17,119 --> 00:35:19,750
um
the establishment of the austrian school

2088
00:35:19,750 --> 00:35:19,760
the establishment of the austrian school
 

2089
00:35:19,760 --> 00:35:23,829
the establishment of the austrian school
per se came in 1871 150 years ago when

00:35:26,880 --> 00:35:28,069
wrote a book called principles of
economics

economics
 

2097
00:35:28,079 --> 00:35:30,150
economics
and essentially invented marginal

00:35:30,150 --> 00:35:30,160
and essentially invented marginal
 

2099
00:35:30,160 --> 00:35:31,670
and essentially invented marginal
analysis which is a big deal in

00:35:31,670 --> 00:35:31,680
analysis which is a big deal in
 

2101
00:35:31,680 --> 00:35:33,910
analysis which is a big deal in
economics marginal analysis is the idea

economics marginal analysis is the idea
 

2103
00:35:33,920 --> 00:35:36,310
economics marginal analysis is the idea
that in economics individuals carry out

2104
00:35:36,310 --> 00:35:36,320
that in economics individuals carry out
 

2105
00:35:36,320 --> 00:35:39,829
that in economics individuals carry out
decisions at the margin that it's um

2106
00:35:39,829 --> 00:35:39,839
decisions at the margin that it's um
 

2107
00:35:39,839 --> 00:35:42,069
decisions at the margin that it's um
when you when you make choice you're not

2108
00:35:42,069 --> 00:35:42,079
when you when you make choice you're not
 

2109
00:35:42,079 --> 00:35:43,430
when you when you make choice you're not
making it for instance if you're making

2110
00:35:43,430 --> 00:35:43,440
making it for instance if you're making
 

2111
00:35:43,440 --> 00:35:45,910
making it for instance if you're making
a choice between uh what should i spend

2112
00:35:45,910 --> 00:35:45,920
a choice between uh what should i spend
 

2113
00:35:45,920 --> 00:35:47,910
a choice between uh what should i spend
my money on you're not making a choice

2114
00:35:47,910 --> 00:35:47,920
my money on you're not making a choice
 

2115
00:35:47,920 --> 00:35:49,270
my money on you're not making a choice
whether it is

2116
00:35:49,270 --> 00:35:49,280
whether it is
 

2117
00:35:49,280 --> 00:35:50,630
whether it is
um this thing is

2118
00:35:50,630 --> 00:35:50,640
um this thing is
 

2119
00:35:50,640 --> 00:35:52,790
um this thing is
object a or b which one is more valuable

2120
00:35:52,790 --> 00:35:52,800
object a or b which one is more valuable
 

2121
00:35:52,800 --> 00:35:54,390
object a or b which one is more valuable
for me in general which one is more

2122
00:35:54,390 --> 00:35:54,400
for me in general which one is more
 

2123
00:35:54,400 --> 00:35:56,630
for me in general which one is more
valuable for me for the rest of my life

2124
00:35:56,630 --> 00:35:56,640
valuable for me for the rest of my life
 

2125
00:35:56,640 --> 00:35:58,230
valuable for me for the rest of my life
you're choosing about the next unit

2126
00:35:58,230 --> 00:35:58,240
you're choosing about the next unit
 

2127
00:35:58,240 --> 00:35:59,349
you're choosing about the next unit
right now

00:35:59,359 --> 00:36:01,190
right now
at this point at this stage and if you

2130
00:36:01,190 --> 00:36:01,200
at this point at this stage and if you
 

2131
00:36:01,200 --> 00:36:03,109
at this point at this stage and if you
analyze economic decision making at the

analyze economic decision making at the
 

2133
00:36:03,119 --> 00:36:05,190
analyze economic decision making at the
margin it makes a lot more sense and you

2134
00:36:05,190 --> 00:36:05,200
margin it makes a lot more sense and you
 

2135
00:36:05,200 --> 00:36:06,950
margin it makes a lot more sense and you
can understand why people decide and

2136
00:36:06,950 --> 00:36:06,960
can understand why people decide and
 

2137
00:36:06,960 --> 00:36:09,589
can understand why people decide and
make the decisions that they do

2138
00:36:09,589 --> 00:36:09,599
make the decisions that they do
 

2139
00:36:09,599 --> 00:36:11,109
make the decisions that they do
whereas if you

2140
00:36:11,109 --> 00:36:11,119
whereas if you
 

2141
00:36:11,119 --> 00:36:12,710
whereas if you
don't apply marginal analysis things

2142
00:36:12,710 --> 00:36:12,720
don't apply marginal analysis things
 

2143
00:36:12,720 --> 00:36:14,230
don't apply marginal analysis things
don't make sense

2144
00:36:14,230 --> 00:36:14,240
don't make sense
 

2145
00:36:14,240 --> 00:36:16,150
don't make sense
the key thing that marginal analysis

2146
00:36:16,150 --> 00:36:16,160
the key thing that marginal analysis
 

2147
00:36:16,160 --> 00:36:17,829
the key thing that marginal analysis
helps us solve is what is called the

2148
00:36:17,829 --> 00:36:17,839
helps us solve is what is called the
 

2149
00:36:17,839 --> 00:36:19,750
helps us solve is what is called the
water diamond paradox

2150
00:36:19,750 --> 00:36:19,760
water diamond paradox
 

2151
00:36:19,760 --> 00:36:22,470
water diamond paradox
so you will die without water we all

2152
00:36:22,470 --> 00:36:22,480
so you will die without water we all
 

2153
00:36:22,480 --> 00:36:25,750
so you will die without water we all
need water and yet water is dirt cheap

2154
00:36:25,750 --> 00:36:25,760
need water and yet water is dirt cheap
 

2155
00:36:25,760 --> 00:36:28,150
need water and yet water is dirt cheap
whereas diamonds are

2156
00:36:28,150 --> 00:36:28,160
whereas diamonds are
 

2157
00:36:28,160 --> 00:36:30,870
whereas diamonds are
extremely superfluous nobody needs them

2158
00:36:30,870 --> 00:36:30,880
extremely superfluous nobody needs them
 

2159
00:36:30,880 --> 00:36:32,470
extremely superfluous nobody needs them
nobody's going to live or die because

2160
00:36:32,470 --> 00:36:32,480
nobody's going to live or die because
 

2161
00:36:32,480 --> 00:36:33,990
nobody's going to live or die because
they have a diamond and yet they're

2162
00:36:33,990 --> 00:36:34,000
they have a diamond and yet they're
 

2163
00:36:34,000 --> 00:36:36,310
they have a diamond and yet they're
extremely expensive so why is it that as

2164
00:36:36,310 --> 00:36:36,320
extremely expensive so why is it that as
 

2165
00:36:36,320 --> 00:36:37,910
extremely expensive so why is it that as
human beings we pay

2166
00:36:37,910 --> 00:36:37,920
human beings we pay
 

2167
00:36:37,920 --> 00:36:40,470
human beings we pay
maybe say a dollar a liter

2168
00:36:40,470 --> 00:36:40,480
maybe say a dollar a liter
 

2169
00:36:40,480 --> 00:36:42,710
maybe say a dollar a liter
for water whereas we pay thousands of

2170
00:36:42,710 --> 00:36:42,720
for water whereas we pay thousands of
 

2171
00:36:42,720 --> 00:36:44,950
for water whereas we pay thousands of
dollars for a few grams of diamonds

2172
00:36:44,950 --> 00:36:44,960
dollars for a few grams of diamonds
 

2173
00:36:44,960 --> 00:36:47,670
dollars for a few grams of diamonds
why is this the case do we value water

2174
00:36:47,670 --> 00:36:47,680
why is this the case do we value water
 

2175
00:36:47,680 --> 00:36:49,109
why is this the case do we value water
less than diamond

2176
00:36:49,109 --> 00:36:49,119
less than diamond
 

2177
00:36:49,119 --> 00:36:52,310
less than diamond
the answer is no but at the margin

2178
00:36:52,310 --> 00:36:52,320
the answer is no but at the margin
 

2179
00:36:52,320 --> 00:36:54,310
the answer is no but at the margin
where we are right now you live in a

2180
00:36:54,310 --> 00:36:54,320
where we are right now you live in a
 

2181
00:36:54,320 --> 00:36:55,829
where we are right now you live in a
place where water is very abundant

2182
00:36:55,829 --> 00:36:55,839
place where water is very abundant
 

2183
00:36:55,839 --> 00:36:57,750
place where water is very abundant
because cities are only built in places

2184
00:36:57,750 --> 00:36:57,760
because cities are only built in places
 

2185
00:36:57,760 --> 00:36:59,510
because cities are only built in places
where water is abundant

2186
00:36:59,510 --> 00:36:59,520
where water is abundant
 

2187
00:36:59,520 --> 00:37:02,150
where water is abundant
and um

2188
00:37:02,150 --> 00:37:02,160
and um
 

2189
00:37:02,160 --> 00:37:03,670
and um
you're only making a choice about the

2190
00:37:03,670 --> 00:37:03,680
you're only making a choice about the
 

2191
00:37:03,680 --> 00:37:06,150
you're only making a choice about the
next unit of water and so water is

2192
00:37:06,150 --> 00:37:06,160
next unit of water and so water is
 

2193
00:37:06,160 --> 00:37:09,030
next unit of water and so water is
extremely abundant and you're choosing

2194
00:37:09,030 --> 00:37:09,040
extremely abundant and you're choosing
 

2195
00:37:09,040 --> 00:37:11,750
extremely abundant and you're choosing
about whether to spend the next

2196
00:37:11,750 --> 00:37:11,760
about whether to spend the next
 

2197
00:37:11,760 --> 00:37:15,270
about whether to spend the next
unit of money on water the valuation

2198
00:37:15,270 --> 00:37:15,280
unit of money on water the valuation
 

2199
00:37:15,280 --> 00:37:16,870
unit of money on water the valuation
that you give to water given that you

2200
00:37:16,870 --> 00:37:16,880
that you give to water given that you
 

2201
00:37:16,880 --> 00:37:18,790
that you give to water given that you
have a lot of water at home

2202
00:37:18,790 --> 00:37:18,800
have a lot of water at home
 

2203
00:37:18,800 --> 00:37:19,990
have a lot of water at home
and then you live in a place that has

2204
00:37:19,990 --> 00:37:20,000
and then you live in a place that has
 

2205
00:37:20,000 --> 00:37:21,430
and then you live in a place that has
abundant water

2206
00:37:21,430 --> 00:37:21,440
abundant water
 

2207
00:37:21,440 --> 00:37:24,630
abundant water
is pretty low to the marginal unit

2208
00:37:24,630 --> 00:37:24,640
is pretty low to the marginal unit
 

2209
00:37:24,640 --> 00:37:27,030
is pretty low to the marginal unit
but it's very high for water overall so

2210
00:37:27,030 --> 00:37:27,040
but it's very high for water overall so
 

2211
00:37:27,040 --> 00:37:28,390
but it's very high for water overall so
if i asked you

2212
00:37:28,390 --> 00:37:28,400
if i asked you
 

2213
00:37:28,400 --> 00:37:30,150
if i asked you
how much would you spend for

2214
00:37:30,150 --> 00:37:30,160
how much would you spend for
 

2215
00:37:30,160 --> 00:37:32,310
how much would you spend for
water in general you know how much would

2216
00:37:32,310 --> 00:37:32,320
water in general you know how much would
 

2217
00:37:32,320 --> 00:37:33,030
water in general you know how much would
you

2218
00:37:33,030 --> 00:37:33,040
you
 

2219
00:37:33,040 --> 00:37:34,950
you
pay for water for all of your life it

2220
00:37:34,950 --> 00:37:34,960
pay for water for all of your life it
 

2221
00:37:34,960 --> 00:37:37,109
pay for water for all of your life it
would be a lot higher than diamonds if i

2222
00:37:37,109 --> 00:37:37,119
would be a lot higher than diamonds if i
 

2223
00:37:37,119 --> 00:37:38,710
would be a lot higher than diamonds if i
told you you can only have water or

2224
00:37:38,710 --> 00:37:38,720
told you you can only have water or
 

2225
00:37:38,720 --> 00:37:40,550
told you you can only have water or
diamonds for the rest of your life you

2226
00:37:40,550 --> 00:37:40,560
diamonds for the rest of your life you
 

2227
00:37:40,560 --> 00:37:42,310
diamonds for the rest of your life you
choose water obviously

2228
00:37:42,310 --> 00:37:42,320
choose water obviously
 

2229
00:37:42,320 --> 00:37:44,310
choose water obviously
but you nobody's ever had to make that

2230
00:37:44,310 --> 00:37:44,320
but you nobody's ever had to make that
 

2231
00:37:44,320 --> 00:37:46,230
but you nobody's ever had to make that
choice you only make your choices at the

2232
00:37:46,230 --> 00:37:46,240
choice you only make your choices at the
 

2233
00:37:46,240 --> 00:37:47,190
choice you only make your choices at the
margin

2234
00:37:47,190 --> 00:37:47,200
margin
 

2235
00:37:47,200 --> 00:37:49,510
margin
so at the margin where we are modern

2236
00:37:49,510 --> 00:37:49,520
so at the margin where we are modern
 

2237
00:37:49,520 --> 00:37:51,030
so at the margin where we are modern
civilization we have an abundance of

2238
00:37:51,030 --> 00:37:51,040
civilization we have an abundance of
 

2239
00:37:51,040 --> 00:37:52,950
civilization we have an abundance of
water that's why we have civilization

2240
00:37:52,950 --> 00:37:52,960
water that's why we have civilization
 

2241
00:37:52,960 --> 00:37:54,950
water that's why we have civilization
and diamonds are very rare and scarce

2242
00:37:54,950 --> 00:37:54,960
and diamonds are very rare and scarce
 

2243
00:37:54,960 --> 00:37:56,310
and diamonds are very rare and scarce
and um

2244
00:37:56,310 --> 00:37:56,320
and um
 

2245
00:37:56,320 --> 00:37:58,870
and um
people are only buying you know you buy

2246
00:37:58,870 --> 00:37:58,880
people are only buying you know you buy
 

2247
00:37:58,880 --> 00:38:00,710
people are only buying you know you buy
your first diamond when you're going to

2248
00:38:00,710 --> 00:38:00,720
your first diamond when you're going to
 

2249
00:38:00,720 --> 00:38:03,190
your first diamond when you're going to
get married and you give it to your wife

2250
00:38:03,190 --> 00:38:03,200
get married and you give it to your wife
 

2251
00:38:03,200 --> 00:38:04,950
get married and you give it to your wife
and that's it's going to be the first

2252
00:38:04,950 --> 00:38:04,960
and that's it's going to be the first
 

2253
00:38:04,960 --> 00:38:07,030
and that's it's going to be the first

the analysis of like gold and so on

00:38:25,750 --> 00:38:25,760
the analysis of like gold and so on
 

2273
00:38:25,760 --> 00:38:28,310
the analysis of like gold and so on
that's a great question um

ownership was banned in the us in the
 

2287
00:38:40,880 --> 00:38:42,870
ownership was banned in the us in the

world so before that you'd give gold and
 

2291

world so before that you'd give gold and
the reason you'd give gold in a dowry in

00:38:47,750 --> 00:38:47,760
the reason you'd give gold in a dowry in
 

2293

uh wedding
 

2295
00:38:49,359 --> 00:38:51,349
uh wedding
is because you know it wasn't just that

2296
00:38:51,349 --> 00:38:51,359
is because you know it wasn't just that
 

2297
00:38:51,359 --> 00:38:53,109
is because you know it wasn't just that
it's pretty and shiny it's because it's

2298
00:38:53,109 --> 00:38:53,119
it's pretty and shiny it's because it's
 

2299
00:38:53,119 --> 00:38:56,710
it's pretty and shiny it's because it's
money and so um you know you die and

2300
00:38:56,710 --> 00:38:56,720
money and so um you know you die and
 

2301
00:38:56,720 --> 00:38:58,470
money and so um you know you die and
your wife can take the gold and she can

2302
00:38:58,470 --> 00:38:58,480
your wife can take the gold and she can
 

2303
00:38:58,480 --> 00:39:00,710
your wife can take the gold and she can
live off of it um it's it's a

2304
00:39:00,710 --> 00:39:00,720
live off of it um it's it's a
 

2305
00:39:00,720 --> 00:39:01,750
live off of it um it's it's a
demonstration that you're giving her

2306
00:39:01,750 --> 00:39:01,760
demonstration that you're giving her
 

2307
00:39:01,760 --> 00:39:03,109
demonstration that you're giving her
something valuable

2308
00:39:03,109 --> 00:39:03,119
something valuable
 

2309
00:39:03,119 --> 00:39:05,190
something valuable
and that's because nobody can make a lot

2310
00:39:05,190 --> 00:39:05,200
and that's because nobody can make a lot
 

2311
00:39:05,200 --> 00:39:06,470
and that's because nobody can make a lot
more gold that has the high stock to

2312
00:39:06,470 --> 00:39:06,480
more gold that has the high stock to
 

2313
00:39:06,480 --> 00:39:08,870
more gold that has the high stock to
flow ratio but then they banned gold

2314
00:39:08,870 --> 00:39:08,880
flow ratio but then they banned gold
 

2315
00:39:08,880 --> 00:39:10,790
flow ratio but then they banned gold
ownership or they allowed people to only

2316
00:39:10,790 --> 00:39:10,800
ownership or they allowed people to only
 

2317
00:39:10,800 --> 00:39:12,790
ownership or they allowed people to only
own very tiny quantities of gold and

2318
00:39:12,790 --> 00:39:12,800
own very tiny quantities of gold and
 

2319
00:39:12,800 --> 00:39:15,030
own very tiny quantities of gold and
that's when the diamond industry stepped

2320
00:39:15,030 --> 00:39:15,040
that's when the diamond industry stepped
 

2321
00:39:15,040 --> 00:39:17,910
that's when the diamond industry stepped
in and marketed diamonds as um

2322
00:39:17,910 --> 00:39:17,920
in and marketed diamonds as um
 

2323
00:39:17,920 --> 00:39:19,750
in and marketed diamonds as um
you know the thing that you need to give

2324
00:39:19,750 --> 00:39:19,760
you know the thing that you need to give
 

2325
00:39:19,760 --> 00:39:21,430
you know the thing that you need to give
but the problem with it is of course

2326
00:39:21,430 --> 00:39:21,440
but the problem with it is of course
 

2327
00:39:21,440 --> 00:39:23,030
but the problem with it is of course
that diamonds aren't

2328
00:39:23,030 --> 00:39:23,040
that diamonds aren't
 

2329
00:39:23,040 --> 00:39:25,910
that diamonds aren't
like gold they're not very hard to

2330
00:39:25,910 --> 00:39:25,920
like gold they're not very hard to
 

2331
00:39:25,920 --> 00:39:28,550
like gold they're not very hard to
make more of and the reason we have

2332
00:39:28,550 --> 00:39:28,560
make more of and the reason we have
 

2333
00:39:28,560 --> 00:39:29,910
make more of and the reason we have
scarcity in diamonds is really

2334
00:39:29,910 --> 00:39:29,920
scarcity in diamonds is really
 

2335
00:39:29,920 --> 00:39:32,230
scarcity in diamonds is really
artificial there's a there's effectively

2336
00:39:32,230 --> 00:39:32,240
artificial there's a there's effectively
 

2337
00:39:32,240 --> 00:39:34,630
artificial there's a there's effectively
a monopoly of diamond producers they

2338
00:39:34,630 --> 00:39:34,640
a monopoly of diamond producers they
 

2339
00:39:34,640 --> 00:39:36,470
a monopoly of diamond producers they
restrict the supply

2340
00:39:36,470 --> 00:39:36,480
restrict the supply
 

2341
00:39:36,480 --> 00:39:38,950
restrict the supply
and um it's a pretty dirty business and

2342
00:39:38,950 --> 00:39:38,960
and um it's a pretty dirty business and
 

2343
00:39:38,960 --> 00:39:40,390
and um it's a pretty dirty business and
the way that they do it is you know all

2344
00:39:40,390 --> 00:39:40,400
the way that they do it is you know all
 

2345
00:39:40,400 --> 00:39:43,270
the way that they do it is you know all
the um all of the talk about

2346
00:39:43,270 --> 00:39:43,280
the um all of the talk about
 

2347
00:39:43,280 --> 00:39:44,790
the um all of the talk about
blood diamonds is a way for them to

2348
00:39:44,790 --> 00:39:44,800
blood diamonds is a way for them to
 

2349
00:39:44,800 --> 00:39:47,109
blood diamonds is a way for them to
ensure their monopoly so

2350
00:39:47,109 --> 00:39:47,119
ensure their monopoly so
 

2351
00:39:47,119 --> 00:39:48,150
ensure their monopoly so
um

2352
00:39:48,150 --> 00:39:48,160
um
 

2353
00:39:48,160 --> 00:39:50,150
um
if you're part of the monopoly of

2354
00:39:50,150 --> 00:39:50,160
if you're part of the monopoly of
 

2355
00:39:50,160 --> 00:39:51,910
if you're part of the monopoly of
diamond producers then doesn't matter

2356
00:39:51,910 --> 00:39:51,920
diamond producers then doesn't matter
 

2357
00:39:51,920 --> 00:39:53,589
diamond producers then doesn't matter
how many people get killed producing

2358
00:39:53,589 --> 00:39:53,599
how many people get killed producing
 

2359
00:39:53,599 --> 00:39:55,190
how many people get killed producing
your diamonds if you're out of the

2360
00:39:55,190 --> 00:39:55,200
your diamonds if you're out of the
 

2361
00:39:55,200 --> 00:39:57,270
your diamonds if you're out of the
monopoly then human rights organizations

2362
00:39:57,270 --> 00:39:57,280
monopoly then human rights organizations
 

2363
00:39:57,280 --> 00:39:58,550
monopoly then human rights organizations
descend on you

2364
00:39:58,550 --> 00:39:58,560
descend on you
 

2365
00:39:58,560 --> 00:40:00,710
descend on you
and call for shutting you down for

2366
00:40:00,710 --> 00:40:00,720
and call for shutting you down for
 

2367
00:40:00,720 --> 00:40:02,630
and call for shutting you down for
selling blood diamonds and they're also

2368
00:40:02,630 --> 00:40:02,640
selling blood diamonds and they're also
 

2369
00:40:02,640 --> 00:40:04,069
selling blood diamonds and they're also
restricting the production of artificial

2370
00:40:04,069 --> 00:40:04,079
restricting the production of artificial
 

2371
00:40:04,079 --> 00:40:05,349
restricting the production of artificial
dimes this is the other thing you can

2372
00:40:05,349 --> 00:40:05,359
dimes this is the other thing you can
 

2373
00:40:05,359 --> 00:40:06,790
dimes this is the other thing you can
make artificial diamond you can't make

2374
00:40:06,790 --> 00:40:06,800
make artificial diamond you can't make
 

2375
00:40:06,800 --> 00:40:08,390
make artificial diamond you can't make
artificial gold

2376
00:40:08,390 --> 00:40:08,400
artificial gold
 

2377
00:40:08,400 --> 00:40:10,230
artificial gold
so they restrict the production of

2378
00:40:10,230 --> 00:40:10,240
so they restrict the production of
 

2379
00:40:10,240 --> 00:40:12,390
so they restrict the production of
artificial diamond and they try and um

2380
00:40:12,390 --> 00:40:12,400
artificial diamond and they try and um
 

2381
00:40:12,400 --> 00:40:14,390
artificial diamond and they try and um
insist that you know you shouldn't take

2382
00:40:14,390 --> 00:40:14,400
insist that you know you shouldn't take
 

2383
00:40:14,400 --> 00:40:16,309
insist that you know you shouldn't take
artificial diamonds but they're

2384
00:40:16,309 --> 00:40:16,319
artificial diamonds but they're
 

2385
00:40:16,319 --> 00:40:19,030
artificial diamonds but they're
indistinguishable from real diamonds so

2386
00:40:19,030 --> 00:40:19,040
indistinguishable from real diamonds so
 

2387
00:40:19,040 --> 00:40:20,550
indistinguishable from real diamonds so
it's an artificial scarcity and i think

2388
00:40:20,550 --> 00:40:20,560
it's an artificial scarcity and i think
 

2389
00:40:20,560 --> 00:40:21,750
it's an artificial scarcity and i think
there's going to come a point at some

2390
00:40:21,750 --> 00:40:21,760
there's going to come a point at some
 

2391
00:40:21,760 --> 00:40:22,950
there's going to come a point at some
point that this monopoly is going to

2392
00:40:22,950 --> 00:40:22,960
point that this monopoly is going to
 

2393
00:40:22,960 --> 00:40:24,309
point that this monopoly is going to
break and a lot of people are going to

2394
00:40:24,309 --> 00:40:24,319
break and a lot of people are going to
 

2395
00:40:24,319 --> 00:40:26,309
break and a lot of people are going to
be left with uh

2396
00:40:26,309 --> 00:40:26,319
be left with uh
 

2397
00:40:26,319 --> 00:40:28,390
be left with uh
essentially uh

2398
00:40:28,390 --> 00:40:28,400
essentially uh
 

2399
00:40:28,400 --> 00:40:30,710
essentially uh
highly devalued uh jewelry i'm going to

2400
00:40:30,710 --> 00:40:30,720
highly devalued uh jewelry i'm going to
 

2401
00:40:30,720 --> 00:40:32,790
highly devalued uh jewelry i'm going to
take this segment of the podcast when

2402
00:40:32,790 --> 00:40:32,800
take this segment of the podcast when
 

2403
00:40:32,800 --> 00:40:34,470
take this segment of the podcast when
i'm getting married i'm going to send it

2404
00:40:34,470 --> 00:40:34,480
i'm getting married i'm going to send it

00:40:34,480 --> 00:40:36,950
i'm getting married i'm going to send it
and then instead you're getting

2406
00:40:36,950 --> 00:40:36,960
and then instead you're getting
 

2407
00:40:36,960 --> 00:40:39,510
and then instead you're getting
uh water or bitcoin yes and water and

2408
00:40:39,510 --> 00:40:39,520
uh water or bitcoin yes and water and
 

2409
00:40:39,520 --> 00:40:41,510
uh water or bitcoin yes and water and
bitcoin is all you need so so marginal

2410
00:40:41,510 --> 00:40:41,520
bitcoin is all you need so so marginal
 

2411
00:40:41,520 --> 00:40:44,069
bitcoin is all you need so so marginal
analysis guessing and the margin

2412
00:40:44,069 --> 00:40:44,079
analysis guessing and the margin
 

2413
00:40:44,079 --> 00:40:45,910
analysis guessing and the margin
is the thing that allows you to most

2414
00:40:45,910 --> 00:40:45,920
is the thing that allows you to most
 

2415
00:40:45,920 --> 00:40:47,990
is the thing that allows you to most
accurately capture human nature the

2416
00:40:47,990 --> 00:40:48,000
accurately capture human nature the
 

2417
00:40:48,000 --> 00:40:49,829
accurately capture human nature the
actual day-to-day decisions that we

2418
00:40:49,829 --> 00:40:49,839
actual day-to-day decisions that we
 

2419
00:40:49,839 --> 00:40:51,670
actual day-to-day decisions that we
humans make

2420
00:40:51,670 --> 00:40:51,680
humans make
 

2421
00:40:51,680 --> 00:40:54,150
humans make
yeah that's really revolutionized

2422
00:40:54,150 --> 00:40:54,160
yeah that's really revolutionized
 

2423
00:40:54,160 --> 00:40:56,870
yeah that's really revolutionized
economics so 1870 and that's um that was

2424
00:40:56,870 --> 00:40:56,880
economics so 1870 and that's um that was
 

2425
00:40:56,880 --> 00:40:58,069
economics so 1870 and that's um that was

is arguably the most important economist
 

2439
00:41:10,160 --> 00:41:12,550
is arguably the most important economist
ever and he developed a theory of money

2440
00:41:12,550 --> 00:41:12,560
ever and he developed a theory of money
 

2441
00:41:12,560 --> 00:41:15,109
ever and he developed a theory of money
and um he wrote a book in 1912 called

2442
00:41:15,109 --> 00:41:15,119
and um he wrote a book in 1912 called
 

2443
00:41:15,119 --> 00:41:17,349
and um he wrote a book in 1912 called
the theory of money and credit

2444
00:41:17,349 --> 00:41:17,359
the theory of money and credit
 

2445
00:41:17,359 --> 00:41:19,589
the theory of money and credit
and then in the 40s he wrote human

2446
00:41:19,589 --> 00:41:19,599
and then in the 40s he wrote human
 

2447
00:41:19,599 --> 00:41:21,270
and then in the 40s he wrote human
action which is

2448
00:41:21,270 --> 00:41:21,280
action which is
 

2449
00:41:21,280 --> 00:41:23,589
action which is
a big treatise on economics and i think

2450
00:41:23,589 --> 00:41:23,599
a big treatise on economics and i think
 

2451
00:41:23,599 --> 00:41:26,470
a big treatise on economics and i think
this is um this is the correct tradition

2452
00:41:26,470 --> 00:41:26,480
this is um this is the correct tradition
 

2453
00:41:26,480 --> 00:41:30,550
this is um this is the correct tradition
of economics and before uh world war one

2454
00:41:30,550 --> 00:41:30,560
of economics and before uh world war one
 

2455
00:41:30,560 --> 00:41:32,390
of economics and before uh world war one
this was just known as economics and

2456
00:41:32,390 --> 00:41:32,400
this was just known as economics and
 

2457
00:41:32,400 --> 00:41:33,270
this was just known as economics and
then

2458
00:41:33,270 --> 00:41:33,280
then
 

2459
00:41:33,280 --> 00:41:35,430
then
um after what happened in world war one

2460
00:41:35,430 --> 00:41:35,440
um after what happened in world war one
 

2461
00:41:35,440 --> 00:41:36,870
um after what happened in world war one
and i discussed this in detail in the

2462
00:41:36,870 --> 00:41:36,880
and i discussed this in detail in the
 

2463
00:41:36,880 --> 00:41:39,349
and i discussed this in detail in the
fiat standard is that the bank of

2464
00:41:39,349 --> 00:41:39,359
fiat standard is that the bank of
 

2465
00:41:39,359 --> 00:41:42,150
fiat standard is that the bank of
england essentially went off gold

2466

england essentially went off gold
 

2467
00:41:42,160 --> 00:41:45,190
england essentially went off gold
and tried to pass off their own credit

2468
00:41:45,190 --> 00:41:45,200
and tried to pass off their own credit
 

2469
00:41:45,200 --> 00:41:47,589
and tried to pass off their own credit
as being as good as gold

presented as an innovation
 

2481
00:41:56,880 --> 00:41:58,870
presented as an innovation
um later on

2482
00:41:58,870 --> 00:41:58,880
um later on
 

2483
00:41:58,880 --> 00:42:00,470
um later on
they needed essentially a propaganda

2484
00:42:00,470 --> 00:42:00,480
they needed essentially a propaganda
 

2485
00:42:00,480 --> 00:42:03,190
they needed essentially a propaganda
school that would justify what they did

2486
00:42:03,190 --> 00:42:03,200
school that would justify what they did
 

2487
00:42:03,200 --> 00:42:03,990
school that would justify what they did
and

2488
00:42:03,990 --> 00:42:04,000
and
 

2489
00:42:04,000 --> 00:42:06,630
and
later on it's presented as oh hey we

2490
00:42:06,630 --> 00:42:06,640
later on it's presented as oh hey we
 

2491
00:42:06,640 --> 00:42:08,470
later on it's presented as oh hey we
realized that gold was not good and now

2492
00:42:08,470 --> 00:42:08,480
realized that gold was not good and now
 

2493
00:42:08,480 --> 00:42:10,710
realized that gold was not good and now
look we've built this thing

2494
00:42:10,710 --> 00:42:10,720
look we've built this thing
 

2495
00:42:10,720 --> 00:42:12,309
look we've built this thing
that is better than goldware now the

2496
00:42:12,309 --> 00:42:12,319
that is better than goldware now the
 

2497
00:42:12,319 --> 00:42:13,750
that is better than goldware now the
government can just print money whenever

2498
00:42:13,750 --> 00:42:13,760
government can just print money whenever
 

2499
00:42:13,760 --> 00:42:15,430
government can just print money whenever
it wants and now

2500
00:42:15,430 --> 00:42:15,440
it wants and now
 

2501
00:42:15,440 --> 00:42:17,910
it wants and now
um gold money is not an issue anymore

2502
00:42:17,910 --> 00:42:17,920
um gold money is not an issue anymore
 

2503
00:42:17,920 --> 00:42:21,030
um gold money is not an issue anymore
which is extremely idiotic because the

2504
00:42:21,030 --> 00:42:21,040
which is extremely idiotic because the
 

2505
00:42:21,040 --> 00:42:22,630
which is extremely idiotic because the
whole point of money is that it's not

2506
00:42:22,630 --> 00:42:22,640
whole point of money is that it's not
 

2507
00:42:22,640 --> 00:42:24,069
whole point of money is that it's not
easy to make if it's easy to make it's

2508
00:42:24,069 --> 00:42:24,079
easy to make if it's easy to make it's
 

2509
00:42:24,079 --> 00:42:25,510
easy to make if it's easy to make it's
not money anymore it's just destroying

2510
00:42:25,510 --> 00:42:25,520
not money anymore it's just destroying
 

2511
00:42:25,520 --> 00:42:26,550
not money anymore it's just destroying
the entire

2512
00:42:26,550 --> 00:42:26,560
the entire
 

2513
00:42:26,560 --> 00:42:27,990
the entire
function of money and we've seen that

2514
00:42:27,990 --> 00:42:28,000
function of money and we've seen that
 

2515
00:42:28,000 --> 00:42:30,309
function of money and we've seen that
happen extensively in the 20th century

2516
00:42:30,309 --> 00:42:30,319
happen extensively in the 20th century
 

2517
00:42:30,319 --> 00:42:31,670
happen extensively in the 20th century
after countries went off the gold

2518
00:42:31,670 --> 00:42:31,680
after countries went off the gold
 

2519
00:42:31,680 --> 00:42:32,790
after countries went off the gold
standard

2520
00:42:32,790 --> 00:42:32,800
standard
 

2521
00:42:32,800 --> 00:42:35,109
standard
so essentially keynesian economics is

2522
00:42:35,109 --> 00:42:35,119
so essentially keynesian economics is
 

2523
00:42:35,119 --> 00:42:37,430
so essentially keynesian economics is
just inflation apologia it's just

2524
00:42:37,430 --> 00:42:37,440
just inflation apologia it's just
 

2525
00:42:37,440 --> 00:42:40,390
just inflation apologia it's just
propaganda to justify inflationism and

2526
00:42:40,390 --> 00:42:40,400
propaganda to justify inflationism and
 

2527
00:42:40,400 --> 00:42:41,670
propaganda to justify inflationism and
it's

2528
00:42:41,670 --> 00:42:41,680
it's
 

2529
00:42:41,680 --> 00:42:44,150
it's
profoundly nonsensical it's built on the

2530
00:42:44,150 --> 00:42:44,160
profoundly nonsensical it's built on the
 

2531
00:42:44,160 --> 00:42:47,109
profoundly nonsensical it's built on the
idea that if you just make more money

2532
00:42:47,109 --> 00:42:47,119
idea that if you just make more money
 

2533
00:42:47,119 --> 00:42:49,349
idea that if you just make more money
you can stimulate economic production

2534
00:42:49,349 --> 00:42:49,359
you can stimulate economic production
 

2535
00:42:49,359 --> 00:42:51,270
you can stimulate economic production
and of course this is very self-serving

2536
00:42:51,270 --> 00:42:51,280
and of course this is very self-serving
 

2537
00:42:51,280 --> 00:42:53,030
and of course this is very self-serving
to the central banks and to the banks

2538
00:42:53,030 --> 00:42:53,040
to the central banks and to the banks
 

2539
00:42:53,040 --> 00:42:54,710
to the central banks and to the banks
and to the governments who promote this

2540
00:42:54,710 --> 00:42:54,720
and to the governments who promote this
 

2541
00:42:54,720 --> 00:42:56,230
and to the governments who promote this
nonsense

2542
00:42:56,230 --> 00:42:56,240
nonsense
 

2543
00:42:56,240 --> 00:42:58,710
nonsense
and this is also very pervasive if

2544
00:42:58,710 --> 00:42:58,720
and this is also very pervasive if
 

2545
00:42:58,720 --> 00:43:00,309
and this is also very pervasive if
you've had the misfortune of studying at

2546
00:43:00,309 --> 00:43:00,319
you've had the misfortune of studying at
 

2547
00:43:00,319 --> 00:43:02,790
you've had the misfortune of studying at
a university over the last century you

2548
00:43:02,790 --> 00:43:02,800
a university over the last century you
 

2549
00:43:02,800 --> 00:43:04,790
a university over the last century you
were taught keynesian garbage economics

2550
00:43:04,790 --> 00:43:04,800
were taught keynesian garbage economics
 

2551
00:43:04,800 --> 00:43:07,030
were taught keynesian garbage economics
you were taught that

2552
00:43:07,030 --> 00:43:07,040
you were taught that
 

2553
00:43:07,040 --> 00:43:09,030
you were taught that
if there is a problem in the economy the

2554
00:43:09,030 --> 00:43:09,040
if there is a problem in the economy the
 

2555
00:43:09,040 --> 00:43:10,790
if there is a problem in the economy the
way to fix it is that the government

2556
00:43:10,790 --> 00:43:10,800
way to fix it is that the government
 

2557
00:43:10,800 --> 00:43:12,390
way to fix it is that the government
prints money the government lowers the

2558
00:43:12,390 --> 00:43:12,400
prints money the government lowers the
 

2559
00:43:12,400 --> 00:43:14,230
prints money the government lowers the
interest rate and then

2560
00:43:14,230 --> 00:43:14,240
interest rate and then
 

2561
00:43:14,240 --> 00:43:15,589
interest rate and then
that

2562
00:43:15,589 --> 00:43:15,599
that
 

2563
00:43:15,599 --> 00:43:17,349
that
leads to more economic production which

2564
00:43:17,349 --> 00:43:17,359
leads to more economic production which
 

2565
00:43:17,359 --> 00:43:21,190
leads to more economic production which
is completely nonsensical so

2566
00:43:21,190 --> 00:43:21,200

 

2567
00:43:21,200 --> 00:43:22,309

so you're

2568
00:43:22,309 --> 00:43:22,319
so you're
 

2569
00:43:22,319 --> 00:43:23,990
so you're
again for the listener you're using

2570
00:43:23,990 --> 00:43:24,000
again for the listener you're using
 

2571
00:43:24,000 --> 00:43:26,710
again for the listener you're using
strong words you know push back just to

2572
00:43:26,710 --> 00:43:26,720
strong words you know push back just to
 

2573
00:43:26,720 --> 00:43:28,230
strong words you know push back just to
uh find

2574
00:43:28,230 --> 00:43:28,240
uh find
 

2575
00:43:28,240 --> 00:43:30,309
uh find
uh to please devil the devil's advocate

2576
00:43:30,309 --> 00:43:30,319
uh to please devil the devil's advocate
 

2577
00:43:30,319 --> 00:43:33,430
uh to please devil the devil's advocate
to hopefully one day arrive at the truth

2578
00:43:33,430 --> 00:43:33,440
to hopefully one day arrive at the truth
 

2579
00:43:33,440 --> 00:43:34,710
to hopefully one day arrive at the truth
so

2580
00:43:34,710 --> 00:43:34,720
so
 

2581
00:43:34,720 --> 00:43:37,109
so
just because it's in the interest of the

2582
00:43:37,109 --> 00:43:37,119
just because it's in the interest of the
 

2583
00:43:37,119 --> 00:43:40,630
just because it's in the interest of the
central banks and the government

2584
00:43:40,630 --> 00:43:40,640
central banks and the government
 

2585
00:43:40,640 --> 00:43:42,630
central banks and the government
the interests and the models of

2586
00:43:42,630 --> 00:43:42,640
the interests and the models of
 

2587
00:43:42,640 --> 00:43:44,390
the interests and the models of
keynesian economics and the government

2588
00:43:44,390 --> 00:43:44,400
keynesian economics and the government
 

2589
00:43:44,400 --> 00:43:47,349
keynesian economics and the government
are aligned doesn't mean they're wrong

2590
00:43:47,349 --> 00:43:47,359
are aligned doesn't mean they're wrong
 

2591
00:43:47,359 --> 00:43:49,829
are aligned doesn't mean they're wrong
so let's let's give them a chance

2592
00:43:49,829 --> 00:43:49,839
so let's let's give them a chance
 

2593
00:43:49,839 --> 00:43:52,470
so let's let's give them a chance
so the conventional wisdom

2594
00:43:52,470 --> 00:43:52,480
so the conventional wisdom
 

2595
00:43:52,480 --> 00:43:54,470
so the conventional wisdom
perhaps economics wisdom is that

2596
00:43:54,470 --> 00:43:54,480
perhaps economics wisdom is that
 

2597
00:43:54,480 --> 00:43:56,710
perhaps economics wisdom is that
inflation is good

2598
00:43:56,710 --> 00:43:56,720
inflation is good
 

2599
00:43:56,720 --> 00:43:59,109
inflation is good
uh in moderation as it encourages

2600
00:43:59,109 --> 00:43:59,119
uh in moderation as it encourages
 

2601
00:43:59,119 --> 00:44:01,990
uh in moderation as it encourages
spending but too much is bad because

2602
00:44:01,990 --> 00:44:02,000
spending but too much is bad because
 

2603
00:44:02,000 --> 00:44:04,069
spending but too much is bad because
you know it completely devalues destroys

2604
00:44:04,069 --> 00:44:04,079
you know it completely devalues destroys
 

2605
00:44:04,079 --> 00:44:05,750
you know it completely devalues destroys
people's savings so a little bit of

2606
00:44:05,750 --> 00:44:05,760
people's savings so a little bit of
 

2607
00:44:05,760 --> 00:44:09,030
people's savings so a little bit of
inflation is good to stimulate spending

2608
00:44:09,030 --> 00:44:09,040
inflation is good to stimulate spending
 

2609
00:44:09,040 --> 00:44:10,150
inflation is good to stimulate spending
um

2610
00:44:10,150 --> 00:44:10,160
um
 

2611
00:44:10,160 --> 00:44:11,030
um
and

2612
00:44:11,030 --> 00:44:11,040
and
 

2613
00:44:11,040 --> 00:44:12,710
and
i mean i suppose this is one of the

2614
00:44:12,710 --> 00:44:12,720
i mean i suppose this is one of the
 

2615
00:44:12,720 --> 00:44:15,670
i mean i suppose this is one of the
things that's supported by uh kenzi in

2616
00:44:15,670 --> 00:44:15,680
things that's supported by uh kenzi in
 

2617
00:44:15,680 --> 00:44:17,510
things that's supported by uh kenzi in
economics

2618
00:44:17,510 --> 00:44:17,520
economics
 

2619
00:44:17,520 --> 00:44:19,109
economics
basically the whole point of keynesian

2620
00:44:19,109 --> 00:44:19,119
basically the whole point of keynesian
 

2621
00:44:19,119 --> 00:44:21,190
basically the whole point of keynesian
economics is to try and find

2622
00:44:21,190 --> 00:44:21,200
economics is to try and find
 

2623
00:44:21,200 --> 00:44:23,670
economics is to try and find
an endless array of explanations to

2624
00:44:23,670 --> 00:44:23,680
an endless array of explanations to
 

2625
00:44:23,680 --> 00:44:25,670
an endless array of explanations to
explain why inflation is a good thing

2626
00:44:25,670 --> 00:44:25,680
explain why inflation is a good thing
 

2627
00:44:25,680 --> 00:44:28,309
explain why inflation is a good thing
well it could the chicken and the egg so

2628
00:44:28,309 --> 00:44:28,319
well it could the chicken and the egg so
 

2629
00:44:28,319 --> 00:44:30,550
well it could the chicken and the egg so
that's that's the cynical take yeah this

2630
00:44:30,550 --> 00:44:30,560
that's that's the cynical take yeah this
 

2631
00:44:30,560 --> 00:44:32,390
that's that's the cynical take yeah this
is a propaganda machine to solve the

2632
00:44:32,390 --> 00:44:32,400
is a propaganda machine to solve the
 

2633
00:44:32,400 --> 00:44:33,990
is a propaganda machine to solve the
government's narrative

2634
00:44:33,990 --> 00:44:34,000
government's narrative
 

2635
00:44:34,000 --> 00:44:36,150
government's narrative
the less cynical take is this a bunch of

2636
00:44:36,150 --> 00:44:36,160
the less cynical take is this a bunch of
 

2637
00:44:36,160 --> 00:44:38,630
the less cynical take is this a bunch of
economists who are telling who um

2638
00:44:38,630 --> 00:44:38,640
economists who are telling who um
 

2639
00:44:38,640 --> 00:44:39,910
economists who are telling who um
who figured out this thing and it

2640
00:44:39,910 --> 00:44:39,920
who figured out this thing and it
 

2641
00:44:39,920 --> 00:44:41,430
who figured out this thing and it
happens to be good for banks and

2642
00:44:41,430 --> 00:44:41,440
happens to be good for banks and
 

2643
00:44:41,440 --> 00:44:42,950
happens to be good for banks and
governments and just because it's good

2644
00:44:42,950 --> 00:44:42,960
governments and just because it's good
 

2645
00:44:42,960 --> 00:44:44,550
governments and just because it's good
for them doesn't mean and it justifies

2646
00:44:44,550 --> 00:44:44,560
for them doesn't mean and it justifies
 

2647
00:44:44,560 --> 00:44:47,510
for them doesn't mean and it justifies
the existence of government and uh your

2648
00:44:47,510 --> 00:44:47,520
the existence of government and uh your
 

2649
00:44:47,520 --> 00:44:48,710
the existence of government and uh your
basic

2650
00:44:48,710 --> 00:44:48,720
basic
 

2651
00:44:48,720 --> 00:44:50,470
basic
i don't think it's your basic assumption

2652
00:44:50,470 --> 00:44:50,480
i don't think it's your basic assumption
 

2653
00:44:50,480 --> 00:44:53,109
i don't think it's your basic assumption
but a foundational principle of your

2654
00:44:53,109 --> 00:44:53,119
but a foundational principle of your
 

2655
00:44:53,119 --> 00:44:55,109
but a foundational principle of your
thought is that a lot of government is

2656
00:44:55,109 --> 00:44:55,119
thought is that a lot of government is
 

2657
00:44:55,119 --> 00:44:56,790
thought is that a lot of government is
not a good thing

2658
00:44:56,790 --> 00:44:56,800
not a good thing
 

2659
00:44:56,800 --> 00:44:58,630
not a good thing
your first gut instinct

2660
00:44:58,630 --> 00:44:58,640
your first gut instinct
 

2661
00:44:58,640 --> 00:45:00,309
your first gut instinct
government bad

2662
00:45:00,309 --> 00:45:00,319
government bad
 

2663
00:45:00,319 --> 00:45:01,670
government bad
like i mentioned i lived next door to

2664
00:45:01,670 --> 00:45:01,680
like i mentioned i lived next door to
 

2665
00:45:01,680 --> 00:45:04,950
like i mentioned i lived next door to
michael malus who probably beats you on

2666
00:45:04,950 --> 00:45:04,960
michael malus who probably beats you on
 

2667
00:45:04,960 --> 00:45:07,030
michael malus who probably beats you on
the intensity

2668
00:45:07,030 --> 00:45:07,040
the intensity
 

2669
00:45:07,040 --> 00:45:09,990
the intensity
and how quickly he says government bad

2670
00:45:09,990 --> 00:45:10,000
and how quickly he says government bad
 

2671
00:45:10,000 --> 00:45:11,190
and how quickly he says government bad
so

2672
00:45:11,190 --> 00:45:11,200
so
 

2673
00:45:11,200 --> 00:45:12,710
so
so but there you know there's a

2674
00:45:12,710 --> 00:45:12,720
so but there you know there's a
 

2675
00:45:12,720 --> 00:45:15,750
so but there you know there's a
potential argument for government good

2676
00:45:15,750 --> 00:45:15,760
potential argument for government good
 

2677
00:45:15,760 --> 00:45:17,829
potential argument for government good
go some government is good maybe a lot

2678
00:45:17,829 --> 00:45:17,839
go some government is good maybe a lot
 

2679
00:45:17,839 --> 00:45:19,670
go some government is good maybe a lot
of government is good maybe we need a

2680
00:45:19,670 --> 00:45:19,680
of government is good maybe we need a
 

2681
00:45:19,680 --> 00:45:22,150
of government is good maybe we need a
lot of centralized management

2682
00:45:22,150 --> 00:45:22,160
lot of centralized management
 

2683
00:45:22,160 --> 00:45:23,750
lot of centralized management
for resource allocation and so on

2684
00:45:23,750 --> 00:45:23,760
for resource allocation and so on
 

2685
00:45:23,760 --> 00:45:25,750
for resource allocation and so on
because we humans specialize we're too

2686
00:45:25,750 --> 00:45:25,760
because we humans specialize we're too
 

2687
00:45:25,760 --> 00:45:27,670
because we humans specialize we're too
busy and so on so there's an argument

2688
00:45:27,670 --> 00:45:27,680
busy and so on so there's an argument
 

2689
00:45:27,680 --> 00:45:29,910
busy and so on so there's an argument
for that uh that exists

2690
00:45:29,910 --> 00:45:29,920
for that uh that exists
 

2691
00:45:29,920 --> 00:45:31,670
for that uh that exists
you probably disagree with any possible

2692
00:45:31,670 --> 00:45:31,680
you probably disagree with any possible
 

2693
00:45:31,680 --> 00:45:33,670
you probably disagree with any possible
argument in that side but anyway so why

2694
00:45:33,670 --> 00:45:33,680
argument in that side but anyway so why
 

2695
00:45:33,680 --> 00:45:35,510
argument in that side but anyway so why
is that idea yeah of kensington

2696
00:45:35,510 --> 00:45:35,520
is that idea yeah of kensington
 

2697
00:45:35,520 --> 00:45:37,349
is that idea yeah of kensington
economics wrong i'm going to focus for

2698
00:45:37,349 --> 00:45:37,359
economics wrong i'm going to focus for
 

2699
00:45:37,359 --> 00:45:38,790
economics wrong i'm going to focus for
this on the uh

2700
00:45:38,790 --> 00:45:38,800
this on the uh
 

2701
00:45:38,800 --> 00:45:40,390
this on the uh
money idea the idea that a little bit of

2702
00:45:40,390 --> 00:45:40,400
money idea the idea that a little bit of
 

2703
00:45:40,400 --> 00:45:41,750
money idea the idea that a little bit of
inflation is good

2704
00:45:41,750 --> 00:45:41,760
inflation is good
 

2705
00:45:41,760 --> 00:45:45,270
inflation is good
um the idea here i mean the criticism

2706
00:45:45,270 --> 00:45:45,280
um the idea here i mean the criticism
 

2707
00:45:45,280 --> 00:45:47,349
um the idea here i mean the criticism
is that without inflation people

2708
00:45:47,349 --> 00:45:47,359
is that without inflation people
 

2709
00:45:47,359 --> 00:45:49,030
is that without inflation people
wouldn't spend and then the economy

2710
00:45:49,030 --> 00:45:49,040
wouldn't spend and then the economy
 

2711
00:45:49,040 --> 00:45:50,790
wouldn't spend and then the economy
would come to a grinding halt

2712
00:45:50,790 --> 00:45:50,800
would come to a grinding halt
 

2713
00:45:50,800 --> 00:45:52,710
would come to a grinding halt
and that's nonsensical because people

2714
00:45:52,710 --> 00:45:52,720
and that's nonsensical because people
 

2715
00:45:52,720 --> 00:45:54,950
and that's nonsensical because people
spend not because they want to keep this

2716
00:45:54,950 --> 00:45:54,960
spend not because they want to keep this
 

2717
00:45:54,960 --> 00:45:57,910
spend not because they want to keep this
magical monster called the economy going

2718
00:45:57,910 --> 00:45:57,920
magical monster called the economy going
 

2719
00:45:57,920 --> 00:45:59,270
magical monster called the economy going
people spend because they need to

2720
00:45:59,270 --> 00:45:59,280
people spend because they need to
 

2721
00:45:59,280 --> 00:46:01,270
people spend because they need to
consume because you know that's how we

2722
00:46:01,270 --> 00:46:01,280
consume because you know that's how we
 

2723
00:46:01,280 --> 00:46:02,870
consume because you know that's how we
live that's how we survive you need to

2724
00:46:02,870 --> 00:46:02,880
live that's how we survive you need to
 

2725
00:46:02,880 --> 00:46:05,109
live that's how we survive you need to
eat you need shelter you need clothes to

2726
00:46:05,109 --> 00:46:05,119
eat you need shelter you need clothes to
 

2727
00:46:05,119 --> 00:46:06,790

keep you warm

2728
00:46:06,790 --> 00:46:06,800
keep you warm

quick what about the fear about the
uncertainty of the future where they

2760
00:46:40,790 --> 00:46:40,800
uncertainty of the future where they
 

2761

00:47:01,990 --> 00:47:02,000
we don't need to be motivated to consume
 

2781
00:47:02,000 --> 00:47:04,630
we don't need to be motivated to consume

all kinds of things you know electronics

2796
00:47:19,829 --> 00:47:19,839
all kinds of things you know electronics
 

2797

machines

2798
00:47:20,870 --> 00:47:20,880
machines
 

2799
00:47:20,880 --> 00:47:23,990

so we don't need a desire to consume but

2800
00:47:23,990 --> 00:47:24,000
so we don't need a desire to consume but
 

2801
00:47:24,000 --> 00:47:25,910
so we don't need a desire to consume but
of course the limit on how much we

2802
00:47:25,910 --> 00:47:25,920
of course the limit on how much we
 

2803
00:47:25,920 --> 00:47:27,670
of course the limit on how much we
consume is

2804
00:47:27,670 --> 00:47:27,680
consume is
 

2805
00:47:27,680 --> 00:47:29,270
consume is
opportunity cost

2806
00:47:29,270 --> 00:47:29,280
opportunity cost
 

2807
00:47:29,280 --> 00:47:31,270
opportunity cost
why don't you buy a ferrari well because

2808
00:47:31,270 --> 00:47:31,280
why don't you buy a ferrari well because
 

2809
00:47:31,280 --> 00:47:32,549
why don't you buy a ferrari well because
that's really expensive and it would

2810
00:47:32,549 --> 00:47:32,559
that's really expensive and it would
 

2811
00:47:32,559 --> 00:47:34,390
that's really expensive and it would
mean that you know well maybe you do

2812
00:47:34,390 --> 00:47:34,400
mean that you know well maybe you do
 

2813
00:47:34,400 --> 00:47:36,069
mean that you know well maybe you do
have a ferrari but i mean most people

2814
00:47:36,069 --> 00:47:36,079
have a ferrari but i mean most people
 

2815
00:47:36,079 --> 00:47:37,750
have a ferrari but i mean most people
don't buy ferrari because

2816
00:47:37,750 --> 00:47:37,760
don't buy ferrari because
 

2817
00:47:37,760 --> 00:47:39,349
don't buy ferrari because
it's too expensive they don't they can't

2818
00:47:39,349 --> 00:47:39,359
it's too expensive they don't they can't
 

2819
00:47:39,359 --> 00:47:40,790
it's too expensive they don't they can't
afford it they'd have to work too hard

2820
00:47:40,790 --> 00:47:40,800
afford it they'd have to work too hard
 

2821
00:47:40,800 --> 00:47:41,829
afford it they'd have to work too hard
to get it

2822
00:47:41,829 --> 00:47:41,839
to get it
 

2823
00:47:41,839 --> 00:47:44,549
to get it
um and if they do get it it might mean

2824
00:47:44,549 --> 00:47:44,559
um and if they do get it it might mean
 

2825
00:47:44,559 --> 00:47:45,750
um and if they do get it it might mean
that you know they can't afford their

2826
00:47:45,750 --> 00:47:45,760
that you know they can't afford their
 

2827
00:47:45,760 --> 00:47:48,549
that you know they can't afford their
house anymore so we have to economize

2828
00:47:48,549 --> 00:47:48,559
house anymore so we have to economize
 

2829
00:47:48,559 --> 00:47:50,230
house anymore so we have to economize
that's a good thing and we have to also

2830
00:47:50,230 --> 00:47:50,240
that's a good thing and we have to also
 

2831
00:47:50,240 --> 00:47:53,190
that's a good thing and we have to also
think of the future and so humans

2832
00:47:53,190 --> 00:47:53,200
think of the future and so humans
 

2833
00:47:53,200 --> 00:47:55,430
think of the future and so humans
consume that we don't need more

2834
00:47:55,430 --> 00:47:55,440
consume that we don't need more
 

2835
00:47:55,440 --> 00:47:58,069
consume that we don't need more
motivation to consume we have to deal

2836
00:47:58,069 --> 00:47:58,079
motivation to consume we have to deal
 

2837
00:47:58,079 --> 00:48:00,470
motivation to consume we have to deal
with the economic reality of the things

2838
00:48:00,470 --> 00:48:00,480
with the economic reality of the things
 

2839
00:48:00,480 --> 00:48:02,950
with the economic reality of the things
that limit us from consuming more

2840
00:48:02,950 --> 00:48:02,960
that limit us from consuming more
 

2841
00:48:02,960 --> 00:48:04,790
that limit us from consuming more
so

2842
00:48:04,790 --> 00:48:04,800
so
 

2843
00:48:04,800 --> 00:48:06,870
so
what keynesians present is that when

2844
00:48:06,870 --> 00:48:06,880
what keynesians present is that when
 

2845
00:48:06,880 --> 00:48:08,790
what keynesians present is that when
there is a problem in the economy like

2846
00:48:08,790 --> 00:48:08,800
there is a problem in the economy like
 

2847
00:48:08,800 --> 00:48:11,670
there is a problem in the economy like
there was after world war one

2848
00:48:11,670 --> 00:48:11,680
there was after world war one
 

2849
00:48:11,680 --> 00:48:13,990
there was after world war one
the problem is always

2850
00:48:13,990 --> 00:48:14,000
the problem is always
 

2851
00:48:14,000 --> 00:48:17,030
the problem is always
a result caused by the inflation

2852
00:48:17,030 --> 00:48:17,040
a result caused by the inflation
 

2853
00:48:17,040 --> 00:48:19,030
a result caused by the inflation
and what the keynesian hucksters do is

2854
00:48:19,030 --> 00:48:19,040
and what the keynesian hucksters do is
 

2855
00:48:19,040 --> 00:48:21,349
and what the keynesian hucksters do is
that they look at the inflation

2856
00:48:21,349 --> 00:48:21,359
that they look at the inflation
 

2857
00:48:21,359 --> 00:48:23,349
that they look at the inflation
at the consequences of inflation and

2858
00:48:23,349 --> 00:48:23,359
at the consequences of inflation and
 

2859
00:48:23,359 --> 00:48:25,430
at the consequences of inflation and
blame it on people not spending enough

2860
00:48:25,430 --> 00:48:25,440
blame it on people not spending enough
 

2861
00:48:25,440 --> 00:48:27,030
blame it on people not spending enough
when people are doing the rational thing

2862
00:48:27,030 --> 00:48:27,040
when people are doing the rational thing
 

2863
00:48:27,040 --> 00:48:28,950
when people are doing the rational thing
you know the money is

2864
00:48:28,950 --> 00:48:28,960
you know the money is
 

2865
00:48:28,960 --> 00:48:31,829
you know the money is
the so there was inflation caused

2866
00:48:31,829 --> 00:48:31,839
the so there was inflation caused
 

2867
00:48:31,839 --> 00:48:33,510
the so there was inflation caused
an unsustainable boom it caused the

2868
00:48:33,510 --> 00:48:33,520
an unsustainable boom it caused the
 

2869
00:48:33,520 --> 00:48:35,349
an unsustainable boom it caused the
recession and now a lot of people lost

2870
00:48:35,349 --> 00:48:35,359
recession and now a lot of people lost
 

2871
00:48:35,359 --> 00:48:36,630
recession and now a lot of people lost
their jobs and they don't have enough

2872
00:48:36,630 --> 00:48:36,640
their jobs and they don't have enough
 

2873
00:48:36,640 --> 00:48:38,710
their jobs and they don't have enough
money to go out and spend

2874
00:48:38,710 --> 00:48:38,720
money to go out and spend
 

2875
00:48:38,720 --> 00:48:41,190
money to go out and spend
frivolously so they save for the future

2876
00:48:41,190 --> 00:48:41,200
frivolously so they save for the future
 

2877
00:48:41,200 --> 00:48:43,270
frivolously so they save for the future
the future is uncertain that's a good

2878
00:48:43,270 --> 00:48:43,280
the future is uncertain that's a good
 

2879
00:48:43,280 --> 00:48:46,230
the future is uncertain that's a good
thing you know that's how you fix things

2880
00:48:46,230 --> 00:48:46,240
thing you know that's how you fix things
 

2881
00:48:46,240 --> 00:48:48,710
thing you know that's how you fix things
you begin the recovery by well you know

2882
00:48:48,710 --> 00:48:48,720
you begin the recovery by well you know
 

2883
00:48:48,720 --> 00:48:50,630
you begin the recovery by well you know
you lost some wealth so you spend less

2884
00:48:50,630 --> 00:48:50,640
you lost some wealth so you spend less
 

2885
00:48:50,640 --> 00:48:52,069
you lost some wealth so you spend less
like if you you know if your business

2886
00:48:52,069 --> 00:48:52,079
like if you you know if your business
 

2887

2890
00:48:56,950 --> 00:48:56,960
it's natural and smart that you stop
 

2891
00:48:56,960 --> 00:48:58,390
it's natural and smart that you stop
spending money on the frivolous things

2892
00:48:58,390 --> 00:48:58,400
spending money on the frivolous things
 

2893
00:48:58,400 --> 00:49:00,069
spending money on the frivolous things
that you used to spend

2894
00:49:00,069 --> 00:49:00,079
that you used to spend
 

2895
00:49:00,079 --> 00:49:01,829
that you used to spend
and you save it for the future you

2896
00:49:01,829 --> 00:49:01,839
and you save it for the future you
 

2897
00:49:01,839 --> 00:49:03,510
and you save it for the future you
invest in something else you get a new

2898
00:49:03,510 --> 00:49:03,520
invest in something else you get a new
 

2899
00:49:03,520 --> 00:49:05,510
invest in something else you get a new
job and then once you've recovered you

2900
00:49:05,510 --> 00:49:05,520
job and then once you've recovered you
 

2901
00:49:05,520 --> 00:49:07,670
job and then once you've recovered you
start spending more this is this is very

2902
00:49:07,670 --> 00:49:07,680
start spending more this is this is very
 

2903
00:49:07,680 --> 00:49:09,829
start spending more this is this is very
sane and very good and it's it's the way

2904
00:49:09,829 --> 00:49:09,839
sane and very good and it's it's the way
 

2905
00:49:09,839 --> 00:49:11,270
sane and very good and it's it's the way
to recovery

2906
00:49:11,270 --> 00:49:11,280
to recovery
 

2907
00:49:11,280 --> 00:49:11,990
to recovery
but

2908
00:49:11,990 --> 00:49:12,000
but
 

2909
00:49:12,000 --> 00:49:14,150
but
essentially the keynesians have used

2910
00:49:14,150 --> 00:49:14,160
essentially the keynesians have used
 

2911
00:49:14,160 --> 00:49:16,150
essentially the keynesians have used
this as a justification for more

2912
00:49:16,150 --> 00:49:16,160
this as a justification for more
 

2913
00:49:16,160 --> 00:49:17,349
this as a justification for more
inflation

2914
00:49:17,349 --> 00:49:17,359
inflation
 

2915
00:49:17,359 --> 00:49:19,510
inflation
because inflation is an addiction once

2916
00:49:19,510 --> 00:49:19,520
because inflation is an addiction once
 

2917
00:49:19,520 --> 00:49:21,430
because inflation is an addiction once
the government gets down the path of

2918
00:49:21,430 --> 00:49:21,440
the government gets down the path of
 

2919
00:49:21,440 --> 00:49:23,750
the government gets down the path of
spending money to solve its problems

2920
00:49:23,750 --> 00:49:23,760
spending money to solve its problems
 

2921
00:49:23,760 --> 00:49:24,710
spending money to solve its problems
then

2922
00:49:24,710 --> 00:49:24,720
then
 

2923
00:49:24,720 --> 00:49:26,470
then
every problem looks like it can be

2924
00:49:26,470 --> 00:49:26,480
every problem looks like it can be
 

2925
00:49:26,480 --> 00:49:29,430
every problem looks like it can be
solved by more inflation and so

2926
00:49:29,430 --> 00:49:29,440
solved by more inflation and so
 

2927
00:49:29,440 --> 00:49:31,109
solved by more inflation and so
this is where keynesian economics comes

2928
00:49:31,109 --> 00:49:31,119
this is where keynesian economics comes
 

2929
00:49:31,119 --> 00:49:34,230
this is where keynesian economics comes
in and of course the keynesian economics

2930
00:49:34,230 --> 00:49:34,240
in and of course the keynesian economics
 

2931
00:49:34,240 --> 00:49:36,710
in and of course the keynesian economics
is based on the work of keynes which

2932
00:49:36,710 --> 00:49:36,720
is based on the work of keynes which
 

2933
00:49:36,720 --> 00:49:38,790
is based on the work of keynes which
came in the 1930s

2934
00:49:38,790 --> 00:49:38,800
came in the 1930s
 

2935
00:49:38,800 --> 00:49:41,109
came in the 1930s
and this is the key point like

2936
00:49:41,109 --> 00:49:41,119
and this is the key point like
 

2937
00:49:41,119 --> 00:49:42,950
and this is the key point like
it's portrayed in the textbook as if

2938
00:49:42,950 --> 00:49:42,960
it's portrayed in the textbook as if
 

2939
00:49:42,960 --> 00:49:45,910
it's portrayed in the textbook as if
it's just this this scientific

2940
00:49:45,910 --> 00:49:45,920
it's just this this scientific
 

2941
00:49:45,920 --> 00:49:47,349
it's just this this scientific
breakthrough that you know somebody in

2942
00:49:47,349 --> 00:49:47,359
breakthrough that you know somebody in
 

2943
00:49:47,359 --> 00:49:50,069
breakthrough that you know somebody in
the 1930s this genius came about and

2944
00:49:50,069 --> 00:49:50,079
the 1930s this genius came about and
 

2945
00:49:50,079 --> 00:49:51,750
the 1930s this genius came about and
realized that oh

2946
00:49:51,750 --> 00:49:51,760
realized that oh
 

2947
00:49:51,760 --> 00:49:53,430
realized that oh
we don't actually need gold we don't

2948
00:49:53,430 --> 00:49:53,440
we don't actually need gold we don't
 

2949
00:49:53,440 --> 00:49:54,950
we don't actually need gold we don't
need hard money we can actually just

2950
00:49:54,950 --> 00:49:54,960
need hard money we can actually just
 

2951
00:49:54,960 --> 00:49:56,470
need hard money we can actually just
print all the money

2952
00:49:56,470 --> 00:49:56,480
print all the money
 

2953
00:49:56,480 --> 00:49:59,750
print all the money
and in reality of course it was just the

2954
00:49:59,750 --> 00:49:59,760
and in reality of course it was just the
 

2955
00:49:59,760 --> 00:50:02,390
and in reality of course it was just the
very thin flimsy idiotic justification

2956
00:50:02,390 --> 00:50:02,400
very thin flimsy idiotic justification
 

2957
00:50:02,400 --> 00:50:03,990
very thin flimsy idiotic justification
for what governments were already doing

2958
00:50:03,990 --> 00:50:04,000
for what governments were already doing
 

2959
00:50:04,000 --> 00:50:05,990
for what governments were already doing
for 20 years they'd already gone off the

2960
00:50:05,990 --> 00:50:06,000
for 20 years they'd already gone off the
 

2961
00:50:06,000 --> 00:50:07,510
for 20 years they'd already gone off the
gold standard

2962
00:50:07,510 --> 00:50:07,520
gold standard
 

2963
00:50:07,520 --> 00:50:09,910
gold standard
and they'd gone through 20 years in

2964
00:50:09,910 --> 00:50:09,920
and they'd gone through 20 years in
 

2965
00:50:09,920 --> 00:50:11,190
and they'd gone through 20 years in
which they were lying to their

2966
00:50:11,190 --> 00:50:11,200
which they were lying to their
 

2967
00:50:11,200 --> 00:50:12,630
which they were lying to their
population telling their population

2968
00:50:12,630 --> 00:50:12,640
population telling their population
 

2969
00:50:12,640 --> 00:50:14,309
population telling their population
we're still on a gold standard but you

2970
00:50:14,309 --> 00:50:14,319
we're still on a gold standard but you
 

2971
00:50:14,319 --> 00:50:15,270
we're still on a gold standard but you
know

2972
00:50:15,270 --> 00:50:15,280
know
 

2973
00:50:15,280 --> 00:50:17,829
know
there are problems caused by various

2974
00:50:17,829 --> 00:50:17,839
there are problems caused by various
 

2975
00:50:17,839 --> 00:50:19,030
there are problems caused by various
random things but don't worry we're

2976
00:50:19,030 --> 00:50:19,040
random things but don't worry we're
 

2977
00:50:19,040 --> 00:50:20,309
random things but don't worry we're
going to be going back on the gold

2978
00:50:20,309 --> 00:50:20,319
going to be going back on the gold
 

2979
00:50:20,319 --> 00:50:22,710
going to be going back on the gold
standard 20 years later after they went

2980
00:50:22,710 --> 00:50:22,720
standard 20 years later after they went
 

2981
00:50:22,720 --> 00:50:24,790
standard 20 years later after they went
off the gold standard they come up with

2982
00:50:24,790 --> 00:50:24,800
off the gold standard they come up with
 

2983
00:50:24,800 --> 00:50:25,589
off the gold standard they come up with
this

2984
00:50:25,589 --> 00:50:25,599
this
 

2985
00:50:25,599 --> 00:50:28,150
this
justification for why oh actually the

2986
00:50:28,150 --> 00:50:28,160
justification for why oh actually the
 

2987
00:50:28,160 --> 00:50:30,790
justification for why oh actually the
gold standard was bad and and and this

2988
00:50:30,790 --> 00:50:30,800
gold standard was bad and and and this
 

2989
00:50:30,800 --> 00:50:32,790
gold standard was bad and and and this
is a really pernicious thing about it is

2990
00:50:32,790 --> 00:50:32,800
is a really pernicious thing about it is
 

2991
00:50:32,800 --> 00:50:34,390
is a really pernicious thing about it is
the problems that were caused by us

2992
00:50:34,390 --> 00:50:34,400
the problems that were caused by us
 

2993
00:50:34,400 --> 00:50:36,390
the problems that were caused by us
going off the gold standard

2994
00:50:36,390 --> 00:50:36,400
going off the gold standard
 

2995
00:50:36,400 --> 00:50:37,430
going off the gold standard
were

2996
00:50:37,430 --> 00:50:37,440
were
 

2997
00:50:37,440 --> 00:50:39,349
were
caused by the gold standard and we're

2998
00:50:39,349 --> 00:50:39,359
caused by the gold standard and we're
 

2999
00:50:39,359 --> 00:50:41,589
caused by the gold standard and we're
going to fix them by going off the gold

3000
00:50:41,589 --> 00:50:41,599
going to fix them by going off the gold
 

3001
00:50:41,599 --> 00:50:43,670
going to fix them by going off the gold
standard even more just because

3002
00:50:43,670 --> 00:50:43,680
standard even more just because
 

3003
00:50:43,680 --> 00:50:45,910
standard even more just because
government is lying and it's shady and

3004
00:50:45,910 --> 00:50:45,920
government is lying and it's shady and
 

3005
00:50:45,920 --> 00:50:47,510
government is lying and it's shady and
it does these kinds of things doesn't

3006
00:50:47,510 --> 00:50:47,520
it does these kinds of things doesn't
 

3007
00:50:47,520 --> 00:50:49,750
it does these kinds of things doesn't
mean kenzie and economics is wrong so

3008
00:50:49,750 --> 00:50:49,760
mean kenzie and economics is wrong so
 

3009
00:50:49,760 --> 00:50:51,670
mean kenzie and economics is wrong so
just because i wanted to separate a few

3010
00:50:51,670 --> 00:50:51,680
just because i wanted to separate a few
 

3011
00:50:51,680 --> 00:50:52,950
just because i wanted to separate a few
things you said

3012
00:50:52,950 --> 00:50:52,960
things you said
 

3013
00:50:52,960 --> 00:50:55,270
things you said
it could very well be very wrong

3014
00:50:55,270 --> 00:50:55,280
it could very well be very wrong
 

3015
00:50:55,280 --> 00:50:57,109
it could very well be very wrong
and they could indeed be hucksters all

3016
00:50:57,109 --> 00:50:57,119
and they could indeed be hucksters all
 

3017
00:50:57,119 --> 00:50:59,990
and they could indeed be hucksters all
of these colorful such colorful language

3018
00:50:59,990 --> 00:51:00,000
of these colorful such colorful language
 

3019
00:51:00,000 --> 00:51:02,790
of these colorful such colorful language
uh i love you deeply for this this this

3020
00:51:02,790 --> 00:51:02,800
uh i love you deeply for this this this
 

3021
00:51:02,800 --> 00:51:04,150
uh i love you deeply for this this this
is fun yeah but i mean you know it's not

3022
00:51:04,150 --> 00:51:04,160
is fun yeah but i mean you know it's not
 

3023
00:51:04,160 --> 00:51:05,990
is fun yeah but i mean you know it's not
like somebody like krugman doesn't use

3024
00:51:05,990 --> 00:51:06,000
like somebody like krugman doesn't use
 

3025
00:51:06,000 --> 00:51:07,270
like somebody like krugman doesn't use
this kind of language when discussing

3026
00:51:07,270 --> 00:51:07,280
this kind of language when discussing
 

3027
00:51:07,280 --> 00:51:09,750
this kind of language when discussing
austrians it's just that when actors

3028
00:51:09,750 --> 00:51:09,760
austrians it's just that when actors
 

3029
00:51:09,760 --> 00:51:11,750
austrians it's just that when actors
like him use it it's presented as if it

3030
00:51:11,750 --> 00:51:11,760
like him use it it's presented as if it
 

3031
00:51:11,760 --> 00:51:14,150
like him use it it's presented as if it
is um legitimate because he's you know

3032
00:51:14,150 --> 00:51:14,160
is um legitimate because he's you know
 

3033
00:51:14,160 --> 00:51:15,400
is um legitimate because he's you know
he's part of the major shows

3034
00:51:15,400 --> 00:51:15,410
he's part of the major shows
 

3035
00:51:15,410 --> 00:51:17,030
he's part of the major shows
[Laughter]

3036
00:51:17,030 --> 00:51:17,040
[Laughter]
 

3037
00:51:17,040 --> 00:51:18,069
[Laughter]
so

3038
00:51:18,069 --> 00:51:18,079
so
 

3039
00:51:18,079 --> 00:51:21,030
so
the case they make and the criticism uh

3040
00:51:21,030 --> 00:51:21,040
the case they make and the criticism uh
 

3041
00:51:21,040 --> 00:51:24,069
the case they make and the criticism uh
kenzians make of austrian economics and

3042
00:51:24,069 --> 00:51:24,079
kenzians make of austrian economics and
 

3043
00:51:24,079 --> 00:51:25,190
kenzians make of austrian economics and
the case to make for kensington

3044
00:51:25,190 --> 00:51:25,200
the case to make for kensington
 

3045
00:51:25,200 --> 00:51:27,030
the case to make for kensington
economics is it's based on empirical

3046
00:51:27,030 --> 00:51:27,040
economics is it's based on empirical
 

3047
00:51:27,040 --> 00:51:28,150
economics is it's based on empirical
evidence

3048
00:51:28,150 --> 00:51:28,160
evidence
 

3049
00:51:28,160 --> 00:51:28,950
evidence
so

3050
00:51:28,950 --> 00:51:28,960
so
 

3051
00:51:28,960 --> 00:51:32,230
so
uh austrian economists are pie in the

3052
00:51:32,230 --> 00:51:32,240
uh austrian economists are pie in the
 

3053
00:51:32,240 --> 00:51:34,710
uh austrian economists are pie in the
sky theorists about

3054
00:51:34,710 --> 00:51:34,720
sky theorists about
 

3055
00:51:34,720 --> 00:51:37,430
sky theorists about
like how human nature works and it's

3056
00:51:37,430 --> 00:51:37,440
like how human nature works and it's
 

3057
00:51:37,440 --> 00:51:40,309
like how human nature works and it's
just all theory uh and just like you

3058
00:51:40,309 --> 00:51:40,319
just all theory uh and just like you
 

3059
00:51:40,319 --> 00:51:41,910
just all theory uh and just like you
said kenzie and economics kind of sell

3060
00:51:41,910 --> 00:51:41,920
said kenzie and economics kind of sell
 

3061
00:51:41,920 --> 00:51:44,710
said kenzie and economics kind of sell
it as a science data driven science

3062
00:51:44,710 --> 00:51:44,720
it as a science data driven science
 

3063
00:51:44,720 --> 00:51:47,349
it as a science data driven science
and so um

3064
00:51:47,349 --> 00:51:47,359
and so um
 

3065
00:51:47,359 --> 00:51:49,349
and so um
where's the data bro

3066
00:51:49,349 --> 00:51:49,359
where's the data bro
 

3067
00:51:49,359 --> 00:51:54,950
where's the data bro
on the uh so one way of saying it is um

3068
00:51:54,950 --> 00:51:54,960
on the uh so one way of saying it is um
 

3069
00:51:54,960 --> 00:51:56,230
on the uh so one way of saying it is um
how do you know if we get rid of

3070
00:51:56,230 --> 00:51:56,240
how do you know if we get rid of
 

3071
00:51:56,240 --> 00:51:57,750
how do you know if we get rid of
inflation

3072
00:51:57,750 --> 00:51:57,760
inflation
 

3073
00:51:57,760 --> 00:51:59,349
inflation
how do you know if we get rid of central

3074
00:51:59,349 --> 00:51:59,359
how do you know if we get rid of central
 

3075
00:51:59,359 --> 00:52:02,150
how do you know if we get rid of central
banks if we push toes that direction

3076
00:52:02,150 --> 00:52:02,160
banks if we push toes that direction
 

3077
00:52:02,160 --> 00:52:04,630
banks if we push toes that direction
uh we will have a better world

3078
00:52:04,630 --> 00:52:04,640
uh we will have a better world
 

3079
00:52:04,640 --> 00:52:06,870
uh we will have a better world
a better functioning economy better

3080
00:52:06,870 --> 00:52:06,880
a better functioning economy better
 

3081
00:52:06,880 --> 00:52:09,430
a better functioning economy better
functioning markets better functioning

3082
00:52:09,430 --> 00:52:09,440
functioning markets better functioning
 

3083
00:52:09,440 --> 00:52:10,870
functioning markets better functioning
society

3084
00:52:10,870 --> 00:52:10,880
society
 

3085
00:52:10,880 --> 00:52:11,829
society
this is

3086
00:52:11,829 --> 00:52:11,839
this is
 

3087
00:52:11,839 --> 00:52:13,670
this is
another inaccurate way in which they

3088
00:52:13,670 --> 00:52:13,680
another inaccurate way in which they
 

3089
00:52:13,680 --> 00:52:15,750
another inaccurate way in which they
present uh the economics they present as

3090
00:52:15,750 --> 00:52:15,760
present uh the economics they present as
 

3091
00:52:15,760 --> 00:52:17,430
present uh the economics they present as
if it's just theory and the data doesn't

3092
00:52:17,430 --> 00:52:17,440
if it's just theory and the data doesn't
 

3093
00:52:17,440 --> 00:52:19,589
if it's just theory and the data doesn't
matter but that's not the case

3094
00:52:19,589 --> 00:52:19,599
matter but that's not the case
 

3095
00:52:19,599 --> 00:52:22,069
matter but that's not the case
what the austrians say is that without

3096
00:52:22,069 --> 00:52:22,079
what the austrians say is that without
 

3097
00:52:22,079 --> 00:52:25,190
what the austrians say is that without
guiding theory data is mute data is dumb

3098
00:52:25,190 --> 00:52:25,200
guiding theory data is mute data is dumb
 

3099
00:52:25,200 --> 00:52:27,109
guiding theory data is mute data is dumb
data can't say anything so

3100
00:52:27,109 --> 00:52:27,119
data can't say anything so
 

3101
00:52:27,119 --> 00:52:29,349
data can't say anything so
theory first and then

3102
00:52:29,349 --> 00:52:29,359
theory first and then
 

3103
00:52:29,359 --> 00:52:32,470
theory first and then
you have to have models

3104
00:52:32,470 --> 00:52:32,480
you have to have models
 

3105
00:52:32,480 --> 00:52:35,190
you have to have models
to provide context for interpretation of

3106
00:52:35,190 --> 00:52:35,200
to provide context for interpretation of
 

3107
00:52:35,200 --> 00:52:37,030
to provide context for interpretation of
exact data and it's a sign of just how

3108
00:52:37,030 --> 00:52:37,040
exact data and it's a sign of just how
 

3109
00:52:37,040 --> 00:52:38,790
exact data and it's a sign of just how
little self-awareness they have that

3110
00:52:38,790 --> 00:52:38,800
little self-awareness they have that
 

3111
00:52:38,800 --> 00:52:39,910
little self-awareness they have that
they think

3112
00:52:39,910 --> 00:52:39,920
they think
 

3113
00:52:39,920 --> 00:52:42,309
they think
that they're just being led by the data

3114
00:52:42,309 --> 00:52:42,319
that they're just being led by the data
 

3115
00:52:42,319 --> 00:52:43,829
that they're just being led by the data
when they're

3116
00:52:43,829 --> 00:52:43,839
when they're
 

3117
00:52:43,839 --> 00:52:47,270
when they're
being led by keynes's moronic theories

3118
00:52:47,270 --> 00:52:47,280
being led by keynes's moronic theories
 

3119
00:52:47,280 --> 00:52:50,150
being led by keynes's moronic theories
and it's they use the data to justify

3120
00:52:50,150 --> 00:52:50,160
and it's they use the data to justify
 

3121
00:52:50,160 --> 00:52:52,309
and it's they use the data to justify
those theories and to stick by them

3122
00:52:52,309 --> 00:52:52,319
those theories and to stick by them
 

3123
00:52:52,319 --> 00:52:54,470
those theories and to stick by them
and in fact they are the ones whose

3124
00:52:54,470 --> 00:52:54,480
and in fact they are the ones whose
 

3125
00:52:54,480 --> 00:52:56,710
and in fact they are the ones whose
theories cannot be refuted because it's

3126
00:52:56,710 --> 00:52:56,720
theories cannot be refuted because it's
 

3127
00:52:56,720 --> 00:52:59,349
theories cannot be refuted because it's
just uh it's just government mandated

3128
00:52:59,349 --> 00:52:59,359
just uh it's just government mandated
 

3129
00:52:59,359 --> 00:53:02,230
just uh it's just government mandated
religion so according to keynes's

3130
00:53:02,230 --> 00:53:02,240
religion so according to keynes's
 

3131
00:53:02,240 --> 00:53:03,270
religion so according to keynes's
nonsense

3132
00:53:03,270 --> 00:53:03,280
nonsense
 

3133
00:53:03,280 --> 00:53:05,990
nonsense
um you know

3134
00:53:05,990 --> 00:53:06,000
um you know
 

3135
00:53:06,000 --> 00:53:07,829
um you know
so the way that the whole thing is the

3136
00:53:07,829 --> 00:53:07,839
so the way that the whole thing is the
 

3137
00:53:07,839 --> 00:53:09,990
so the way that the whole thing is the
way that they justify the inflationism

3138
00:53:09,990 --> 00:53:10,000
way that they justify the inflationism
 

3139
00:53:10,000 --> 00:53:11,589
way that they justify the inflationism
is this and i'm just using this to give

3140
00:53:11,589 --> 00:53:11,599
is this and i'm just using this to give
 

3141
00:53:11,599 --> 00:53:13,349
is this and i'm just using this to give
an example of what you're talking about

3142
00:53:13,349 --> 00:53:13,359
an example of what you're talking about
 

3143
00:53:13,359 --> 00:53:15,190
an example of what you're talking about
in terms of theory the way they justify

3144
00:53:15,190 --> 00:53:15,200
in terms of theory the way they justify
 

3145
00:53:15,200 --> 00:53:16,630
in terms of theory the way they justify
the inflationism to tie it back to the

3146
00:53:16,630 --> 00:53:16,640
the inflationism to tie it back to the
 

3147
00:53:16,640 --> 00:53:18,630
the inflationism to tie it back to the
original point they just find it all

3148
00:53:18,630 --> 00:53:18,640
original point they just find it all
 

3149
00:53:18,640 --> 00:53:20,309
original point they just find it all
right we need money to spend and then

3150
00:53:20,309 --> 00:53:20,319
right we need money to spend and then
 

3151
00:53:20,319 --> 00:53:22,069
right we need money to spend and then
the level of spending in the economy is

3152
00:53:22,069 --> 00:53:22,079
the level of spending in the economy is
 

3153
00:53:22,079 --> 00:53:23,589
the level of spending in the economy is
what determines the state of the economy

3154
00:53:23,589 --> 00:53:23,599
what determines the state of the economy
 

3155
00:53:23,599 --> 00:53:25,190
what determines the state of the economy
and i've taught macroeconomics at

3156
00:53:25,190 --> 00:53:25,200
and i've taught macroeconomics at
 

3157
00:53:25,200 --> 00:53:26,630
and i've taught macroeconomics at
university level for a while so i know

3158
00:53:26,630 --> 00:53:26,640
university level for a while so i know
 

3159
00:53:26,640 --> 00:53:29,670
university level for a while so i know
this i i know keynesian nonsense better

3160
00:53:29,670 --> 00:53:29,680
this i i know keynesian nonsense better
 

3161
00:53:29,680 --> 00:53:30,470
this i i know keynesian nonsense better
than

3162
00:53:30,470 --> 00:53:30,480
than
 

3163
00:53:30,480 --> 00:53:32,069
than
most keynesians know austrians if not

3164
00:53:32,069 --> 00:53:32,079
most keynesians know austrians if not
 

3165
00:53:32,079 --> 00:53:35,829
most keynesians know austrians if not
all of them i i guarantee you and so

3166
00:53:35,829 --> 00:53:35,839
all of them i i guarantee you and so
 

3167
00:53:35,839 --> 00:53:37,750
all of them i i guarantee you and so
the way they see it is the level of

3168
00:53:37,750 --> 00:53:37,760
the way they see it is the level of
 

3169
00:53:37,760 --> 00:53:38,710
the way they see it is the level of
spending in the economy is what

3170
00:53:38,710 --> 00:53:38,720
spending in the economy is what
 

3171
00:53:38,720 --> 00:53:40,309
spending in the economy is what
determines the state of the economy

3172
00:53:40,309 --> 00:53:40,319
determines the state of the economy
 

3173
00:53:40,319 --> 00:53:41,829
determines the state of the economy
there's a level of output and there's a

3174
00:53:41,829 --> 00:53:41,839
there's a level of output and there's a
 

3175
00:53:41,839 --> 00:53:43,270
there's a level of output and there's a
level of spending so there's like the

3176
00:53:43,270 --> 00:53:43,280
level of spending so there's like the
 

3177
00:53:43,280 --> 00:53:44,549
level of spending so there's like the
factories on the one side that are

3178
00:53:44,549 --> 00:53:44,559
factories on the one side that are
 

3179
00:53:44,559 --> 00:53:46,630
factories on the one side that are
churning out goods and those goods have

3180
00:53:46,630 --> 00:53:46,640
churning out goods and those goods have
 

3181
00:53:46,640 --> 00:53:49,030
churning out goods and those goods have
a certain quantity and value market

3182
00:53:49,030 --> 00:53:49,040
a certain quantity and value market
 

3183
00:53:49,040 --> 00:53:49,990
a certain quantity and value market
value

3184
00:53:49,990 --> 00:53:50,000
value
 

3185
00:53:50,000 --> 00:53:51,589
value
it's completely nonsensical of course

3186
00:53:51,589 --> 00:53:51,599
it's completely nonsensical of course
 

3187
00:53:51,599 --> 00:53:52,470
it's completely nonsensical of course
because

3188
00:53:52,470 --> 00:53:52,480
because
 

3189
00:53:52,480 --> 00:53:54,309
because
um how can the value of the goods

3190
00:53:54,309 --> 00:53:54,319
um how can the value of the goods
 

3191
00:53:54,319 --> 00:53:55,990
um how can the value of the goods
produced be different from the value of

3192
00:53:55,990 --> 00:53:56,000
produced be different from the value of
 

3193
00:53:56,000 --> 00:53:57,510
produced be different from the value of
the spending but let's put that aside

3194
00:53:57,510 --> 00:53:57,520
the spending but let's put that aside
 

3195
00:53:57,520 --> 00:53:59,990
the spending but let's put that aside
for a sentence for a second

3196
00:53:59,990 --> 00:54:00,000
for a sentence for a second
 

3197
00:54:00,000 --> 00:54:01,430
for a sentence for a second
so the amount of spending that happens

3198
00:54:01,430 --> 00:54:01,440
so the amount of spending that happens
 

3199
00:54:01,440 --> 00:54:03,430
so the amount of spending that happens
in the economy determines the state of

3200
00:54:03,430 --> 00:54:03,440
in the economy determines the state of
 

3201
00:54:03,440 --> 00:54:05,670
in the economy determines the state of
the economy if the value of the

3202
00:54:05,670 --> 00:54:05,680
the economy if the value of the
 

3203
00:54:05,680 --> 00:54:07,829
the economy if the value of the
production which they call y

3204
00:54:07,829 --> 00:54:07,839
production which they call y
 

3205
00:54:07,839 --> 00:54:08,549
production which they call y
is

3206
00:54:08,549 --> 00:54:08,559
is
 

3207
00:54:08,559 --> 00:54:10,309
is
higher than the aggregate expenditure so

3208
00:54:10,309 --> 00:54:10,319
higher than the aggregate expenditure so
 

3209
00:54:10,319 --> 00:54:11,910
higher than the aggregate expenditure so
this is the production and the aggregate

3210
00:54:11,910 --> 00:54:11,920
this is the production and the aggregate
 

3211
00:54:11,920 --> 00:54:14,069
this is the production and the aggregate
expenditure is lower then we don't have

3212
00:54:14,069 --> 00:54:14,079
expenditure is lower then we don't have
 

3213
00:54:14,079 --> 00:54:16,710
expenditure is lower then we don't have
enough spending to buy all the goods and

3214
00:54:16,710 --> 00:54:16,720
enough spending to buy all the goods and
 

3215
00:54:16,720 --> 00:54:18,309
enough spending to buy all the goods and
then that causes a recession the

3216
00:54:18,309 --> 00:54:18,319
then that causes a recession the
 

3217
00:54:18,319 --> 00:54:20,790
then that causes a recession the
factories start laying off workers and

3218
00:54:20,790 --> 00:54:20,800
factories start laying off workers and
 

3219
00:54:20,800 --> 00:54:22,790
factories start laying off workers and
then the laid off workers start spending

3220
00:54:22,790 --> 00:54:22,800
then the laid off workers start spending
 

3221
00:54:22,800 --> 00:54:24,630
then the laid off workers start spending
less and then that leads to aggregate

3222
00:54:24,630 --> 00:54:24,640
less and then that leads to aggregate
 

3223
00:54:24,640 --> 00:54:27,030
less and then that leads to aggregate
expenditure dropping even further and so

3224
00:54:27,030 --> 00:54:27,040
expenditure dropping even further and so
 

3225
00:54:27,040 --> 00:54:29,109
expenditure dropping even further and so
it's a vicious cycle where the economy

3226
00:54:29,109 --> 00:54:29,119
it's a vicious cycle where the economy
 

3227
00:54:29,119 --> 00:54:31,510
it's a vicious cycle where the economy
gets into recession and the only way out

3228
00:54:31,510 --> 00:54:31,520
gets into recession and the only way out
 

3229
00:54:31,520 --> 00:54:33,990
gets into recession and the only way out
is for keynes's bankster buddies and

3230
00:54:33,990 --> 00:54:34,000
is for keynes's bankster buddies and
 

3231
00:54:34,000 --> 00:54:35,750
is for keynes's bankster buddies and
government buddies to print a lot of

3232
00:54:35,750 --> 00:54:35,760
government buddies to print a lot of
 

3233
00:54:35,760 --> 00:54:37,430
government buddies to print a lot of
money to give to themselves

3234
00:54:37,430 --> 00:54:37,440
money to give to themselves
 

3235
00:54:37,440 --> 00:54:39,670
money to give to themselves
and then um that will that's one

3236
00:54:39,670 --> 00:54:39,680
and then um that will that's one
 

3237
00:54:39,680 --> 00:54:42,309
and then um that will that's one
interpretation so but to uh so to print

3238
00:54:42,309 --> 00:54:42,319
interpretation so but to uh so to print
 

3239
00:54:42,319 --> 00:54:44,789
interpretation so but to uh so to print
more money to increase the expenditure

3240
00:54:44,789 --> 00:54:44,799
more money to increase the expenditure
 

3241
00:54:44,799 --> 00:54:46,870
more money to increase the expenditure
that to to match the stimulus the level

3242
00:54:46,870 --> 00:54:46,880
that to to match the stimulus the level
 

3243
00:54:46,880 --> 00:54:49,910
that to to match the stimulus the level
of sounds pretty good to me i'm sold

3244
00:54:49,910 --> 00:54:49,920
of sounds pretty good to me i'm sold
 

3245
00:54:49,920 --> 00:54:51,510
of sounds pretty good to me i'm sold
all right but even though you're saying

3246
00:54:51,510 --> 00:54:51,520
all right but even though you're saying

3257
00:55:04,240 --> 00:55:07,349
you talk and it's great and keep doing
it but just for context um

3258
00:55:07,349 --> 00:55:07,359
it but just for context um
 

3259
00:55:07,359 --> 00:55:09,510
it but just for context um
like i don't know anything that involves

3260
00:55:09,510 --> 00:55:09,520
like i don't know anything that involves
 

3261
00:55:09,520 --> 00:55:10,789
like i don't know anything that involves
human nature

3262
00:55:10,789 --> 00:55:10,799
human nature
 

3263
00:55:10,799 --> 00:55:12,630
human nature
deserves this level of certainty i at

3264
00:55:12,630 --> 00:55:12,640
deserves this level of certainty i at
 

3265
00:55:12,640 --> 00:55:15,109
deserves this level of certainty i at
least my position is that we don't know

3266
00:55:15,109 --> 00:55:15,119
least my position is that we don't know
 

3267
00:55:15,119 --> 00:55:16,710
least my position is that we don't know
what the hell we're doing on basically

3268
00:55:16,710 --> 00:55:16,720
what the hell we're doing on basically
 

3269
00:55:16,720 --> 00:55:19,349
what the hell we're doing on basically
anything and perhaps but i mean like

3270
00:55:19,349 --> 00:55:19,359
anything and perhaps but i mean like
 

3271
00:55:19,359 --> 00:55:20,390
anything and perhaps but i mean like
there's a lot

3272
00:55:20,390 --> 00:55:20,400
there's a lot
 

3273
00:55:20,400 --> 00:55:23,589
there's a lot
like certainty can get us in trouble

3274
00:55:23,589 --> 00:55:23,599
like certainty can get us in trouble
 

3275
00:55:23,599 --> 00:55:25,510
like certainty can get us in trouble
it's my worry i don't know

3276
00:55:25,510 --> 00:55:25,520
it's my worry i don't know
 

3277
00:55:25,520 --> 00:55:27,990
it's my worry i don't know
much about economics i don't even know

3278
00:55:27,990 --> 00:55:28,000
much about economics i don't even know
 

3279
00:55:28,000 --> 00:55:29,910
much about economics i don't even know
you know financial systems monetary

3280
00:55:29,910 --> 00:55:29,920
you know financial systems monetary
 

3281
00:55:29,920 --> 00:55:30,950
you know financial systems monetary
systems

3282
00:55:30,950 --> 00:55:30,960
systems
 

3283
00:55:30,960 --> 00:55:32,069
systems
um

3284
00:55:32,069 --> 00:55:32,079
um
 

3285
00:55:32,079 --> 00:55:33,990
um
but i just seen us get in trouble with

3286
00:55:33,990 --> 00:55:34,000
but i just seen us get in trouble with
 

3287
00:55:34,000 --> 00:55:36,710
but i just seen us get in trouble with
human psychology certainty certainty of

3288
00:55:36,710 --> 00:55:36,720
human psychology certainty certainty of
 

3289
00:55:36,720 --> 00:55:39,109
human psychology certainty certainty of
ideologies in general you mentioned

3290
00:55:39,109 --> 00:55:39,119
ideologies in general you mentioned
 

3291
00:55:39,119 --> 00:55:41,270
ideologies in general you mentioned

00:55:45,109 --> 00:55:45,119
very certain throughout the history of
 

3297
00:55:45,119 --> 00:55:48,309
very certain throughout the history of
the 20th century that communism

3298
00:55:48,309 --> 00:55:48,319
the 20th century that communism
 

3299
00:55:48,319 --> 00:55:51,589
the 20th century that communism
is the utopia that humanity should

3300
00:55:51,589 --> 00:55:51,599
is the utopia that humanity should
 

3301
00:55:51,599 --> 00:55:53,829
is the utopia that humanity should
strive for so i'm i'm nervous around

3302
00:55:53,829 --> 00:55:53,839
strive for so i'm i'm nervous around
 

3303
00:55:53,839 --> 00:55:55,510
strive for so i'm i'm nervous around
certain i could be wrong but you know

3304
00:55:55,510 --> 00:55:55,520
certain i could be wrong but you know
 

3305
00:55:55,520 --> 00:55:57,750
certain i could be wrong but you know
you you asked me for my opinion yes yes

3306
00:55:57,750 --> 00:55:57,760
you you asked me for my opinion yes yes
 

3307
00:55:57,760 --> 00:55:59,589
you you asked me for my opinion yes yes
sorry so it's that little bit of a

3308
00:55:59,589 --> 00:55:59,599
sorry so it's that little bit of a
 

3309
00:55:59,599 --> 00:56:02,549
sorry so it's that little bit of a
caveat so to go back to the idea then on

3310
00:56:02,549 --> 00:56:02,559
caveat so to go back to the idea then on
 

3311
00:56:02,559 --> 00:56:04,549
caveat so to go back to the idea then on
the other hand you have the level of if

3312
00:56:04,549 --> 00:56:04,559
the other hand you have the level of if
 

3313
00:56:04,559 --> 00:56:06,309
the other hand you have the level of if
the the other situation is when the

3314
00:56:06,309 --> 00:56:06,319
the the other situation is when the
 

3315
00:56:06,319 --> 00:56:08,069
the the other situation is when the
level of spending is higher than the

3316
00:56:08,069 --> 00:56:08,079
level of spending is higher than the
 

3317
00:56:08,079 --> 00:56:10,230
level of spending is higher than the
amount of aggregate output yes in that

3318
00:56:10,230 --> 00:56:10,240
amount of aggregate output yes in that
 

3319
00:56:10,240 --> 00:56:11,829
amount of aggregate output yes in that
situation you have too much spending so

3320
00:56:11,829 --> 00:56:11,839
situation you have too much spending so
 

3321
00:56:11,839 --> 00:56:13,109
situation you have too much spending so
therefore what ends up happening is

3322
00:56:13,109 --> 00:56:13,119
therefore what ends up happening is
 

3323
00:56:13,119 --> 00:56:14,470
therefore what ends up happening is
inflation

3324
00:56:14,470 --> 00:56:14,480
inflation
 

3325
00:56:14,480 --> 00:56:16,069
inflation
so according to the keynesian worldview

3326
00:56:16,069 --> 00:56:16,079
so according to the keynesian worldview
 

3327
00:56:16,079 --> 00:56:17,750
so according to the keynesian worldview
this is really important because this is

3328
00:56:17,750 --> 00:56:17,760
this is really important because this is
 

3329
00:56:17,760 --> 00:56:19,190
this is really important because this is
a way that i'm going to get to your

3330
00:56:19,190 --> 00:56:19,200
a way that i'm going to get to your
 

3331
00:56:19,200 --> 00:56:21,190
a way that i'm going to get to your
point about empirical data and to show

3332
00:56:21,190 --> 00:56:21,200
point about empirical data and to show
 

3333
00:56:21,200 --> 00:56:22,309
point about empirical data and to show
you why

3334
00:56:22,309 --> 00:56:22,319
you why
 

3335
00:56:22,319 --> 00:56:23,910
you why
um

3336
00:56:23,910 --> 00:56:23,920
um
 

3337
00:56:23,920 --> 00:56:25,270
um
they're

3338
00:56:25,270 --> 00:56:25,280
they're
 

3339
00:56:25,280 --> 00:56:27,349
they're
not correct yeah they're not correct

3340
00:56:27,349 --> 00:56:27,359
not correct yeah they're not correct
 

3341
00:56:27,359 --> 00:56:29,510
not correct yeah they're not correct
about what they say about empirical data

3342
00:56:29,510 --> 00:56:29,520
about what they say about empirical data
 

3343
00:56:29,520 --> 00:56:31,670
about what they say about empirical data
so then what this means is that there's

3344
00:56:31,670 --> 00:56:31,680
so then what this means is that there's
 

3345
00:56:31,680 --> 00:56:33,109
so then what this means is that there's
a level of output and there's a level of

3346
00:56:33,109 --> 00:56:33,119
a level of output and there's a level of
 

3347
00:56:33,119 --> 00:56:34,549
a level of output and there's a level of
aggregate expenditure the aggregate

3348
00:56:34,549 --> 00:56:34,559
aggregate expenditure the aggregate
 

3349
00:56:34,559 --> 00:56:36,150
aggregate expenditure the aggregate
expenditure can either be higher or

3350
00:56:36,150 --> 00:56:36,160
expenditure can either be higher or
 

3351
00:56:36,160 --> 00:56:38,549
expenditure can either be higher or
lower than the output or equal to it

3352
00:56:38,549 --> 00:56:38,559
lower than the output or equal to it
 

3353
00:56:38,559 --> 00:56:39,910
lower than the output or equal to it
if it's higher

3354
00:56:39,910 --> 00:56:39,920
if it's higher
 

3355
00:56:39,920 --> 00:56:44,230
if it's higher
we get inflation if it's lower we get

3356
00:56:44,230 --> 00:56:44,240
we get inflation if it's lower we get
 

3357
00:56:44,240 --> 00:56:45,349
we get inflation if it's lower we get
recessions

3358
00:56:45,349 --> 00:56:45,359
recessions
 

3359
00:56:45,359 --> 00:56:46,549
recessions
okay

3360
00:56:46,549 --> 00:56:46,559
okay
 

3361
00:56:46,559 --> 00:56:47,430
okay
so

3362
00:56:47,430 --> 00:56:47,440
so
 

3363
00:56:47,440 --> 00:56:49,990
so
is there any universe in this model is

3364
00:56:49,990 --> 00:56:50,000
is there any universe in this model is
 

3365
00:56:50,000 --> 00:56:51,109
is there any universe in this model is
there any

3366
00:56:51,109 --> 00:56:51,119
there any
 

3367
00:56:51,119 --> 00:56:53,349
there any
potential universe in which you can have

3368
00:56:53,349 --> 00:56:53,359
potential universe in which you can have
 

3369
00:56:53,359 --> 00:56:56,150
potential universe in which you can have
both inflation and a recession

3370
00:56:56,150 --> 00:56:56,160
both inflation and a recession
 

3371
00:56:56,160 --> 00:56:58,069
both inflation and a recession
according to the keynesian model you

3372
00:56:58,069 --> 00:56:58,079
according to the keynesian model you
 

3373
00:56:58,079 --> 00:56:58,950
according to the keynesian model you
can't

3374
00:56:58,950 --> 00:56:58,960
can't
 

3375
00:56:58,960 --> 00:57:00,630
can't
right because aggregate expenditures

3376
00:57:00,630 --> 00:57:00,640
right because aggregate expenditures
 

3377
00:57:00,640 --> 00:57:03,589
right because aggregate expenditures
cannot be both higher and lower than

3378
00:57:03,589 --> 00:57:03,599
cannot be both higher and lower than
 

3379
00:57:03,599 --> 00:57:04,870
cannot be both higher and lower than
output

3380
00:57:04,870 --> 00:57:04,880
output
 

3381
00:57:04,880 --> 00:57:06,549
output
so therefore if you were truly being an

3382
00:57:06,549 --> 00:57:06,559
so therefore if you were truly being an
 

3383
00:57:06,559 --> 00:57:09,030
so therefore if you were truly being an
empirical uh person if you were looking

3384
00:57:09,030 --> 00:57:09,040
empirical uh person if you were looking
 

3385
00:57:09,040 --> 00:57:10,710
empirical uh person if you were looking
at evidence and trying to be

3386
00:57:10,710 --> 00:57:10,720
at evidence and trying to be
 

3387
00:57:10,720 --> 00:57:13,270
at evidence and trying to be
and like trying to analyze data you'd

3388
00:57:13,270 --> 00:57:13,280
and like trying to analyze data you'd
 

3389
00:57:13,280 --> 00:57:14,789
and like trying to analyze data you'd
look at this and say

3390
00:57:14,789 --> 00:57:14,799
look at this and say
 

3391
00:57:14,799 --> 00:57:16,870
look at this and say
one example you know one you just need

3392
00:57:16,870 --> 00:57:16,880
one example you know one you just need
 

3393
00:57:16,880 --> 00:57:19,030
one example you know one you just need
one example of high inflation and high

3394
00:57:19,030 --> 00:57:19,040
one example of high inflation and high
 

3395
00:57:19,040 --> 00:57:22,549
one example of high inflation and high
unemployment to refute this entire model

3396
00:57:22,549 --> 00:57:22,559
unemployment to refute this entire model
 

3397
00:57:22,559 --> 00:57:23,589
unemployment to refute this entire model
right

3398
00:57:23,589 --> 00:57:23,599
right
 

3399
00:57:23,599 --> 00:57:25,430
right
and of course the world is full of

3400
00:57:25,430 --> 00:57:25,440
and of course the world is full of
 

3401
00:57:25,440 --> 00:57:27,030
and of course the world is full of
examples of high inflation and high

3402
00:57:27,030 --> 00:57:27,040
examples of high inflation and high
 

3403
00:57:27,040 --> 00:57:28,789
examples of high inflation and high
unemployment and that's what happened in

3404
00:57:28,789 --> 00:57:28,799
unemployment and that's what happened in
 

3405
00:57:28,799 --> 00:57:30,069
unemployment and that's what happened in
the 19 and of course you know they

3406
00:57:30,069 --> 00:57:30,079
the 19 and of course you know they
 

3407
00:57:30,079 --> 00:57:31,670
the 19 and of course you know they
ignored it and when it happens in poor

3408
00:57:31,670 --> 00:57:31,680
ignored it and when it happens in poor
 

3409
00:57:31,680 --> 00:57:32,789
ignored it and when it happens in poor
countries because you know poor

3410
00:57:32,789 --> 00:57:32,799
countries because you know poor
 

3411
00:57:32,799 --> 00:57:34,549
countries because you know poor
countries don't really matter but then

3412
00:57:34,549 --> 00:57:34,559
countries don't really matter but then
 

3413
00:57:34,559 --> 00:57:37,030
countries don't really matter but then
in the 1970s that happened in the u.s

3414
00:57:37,030 --> 00:57:37,040
in the 1970s that happened in the u.s
 

3415
00:57:37,040 --> 00:57:38,470
in the 1970s that happened in the u.s
and in the western economies in the most

3416
00:57:38,470 --> 00:57:38,480
and in the western economies in the most
 

3417
00:57:38,480 --> 00:57:40,549
and in the western economies in the most
advanced industrial economies so

3418
00:57:40,549 --> 00:57:40,559
advanced industrial economies so
 

3419
00:57:40,559 --> 00:57:42,710
advanced industrial economies so
historically before then you had all

3420
00:57:42,710 --> 00:57:42,720
historically before then you had all
 

3421
00:57:42,720 --> 00:57:44,549
historically before then you had all
these keynesian

3422
00:57:44,549 --> 00:57:44,559
these keynesian
 

3423
00:57:44,559 --> 00:57:47,109
these keynesian
central bankers

3424
00:57:47,109 --> 00:57:47,119
central bankers
 

3425
00:57:47,119 --> 00:57:48,710
central bankers
talking about this model and saying you

3426
00:57:48,710 --> 00:57:48,720
talking about this model and saying you
 

3427
00:57:48,720 --> 00:57:50,309
talking about this model and saying you
know well aggregate expenditures too low

3428
00:57:50,309 --> 00:57:50,319
know well aggregate expenditures too low
 

3429
00:57:50,319 --> 00:57:52,230
know well aggregate expenditures too low
now and that's why we have unemployment

3430
00:57:52,230 --> 00:57:52,240
now and that's why we have unemployment
 

3431
00:57:52,240 --> 00:57:53,670
now and that's why we have unemployment
so we need to print more money and then

3432
00:57:53,670 --> 00:57:53,680
so we need to print more money and then
 

3433
00:57:53,680 --> 00:57:56,390
so we need to print more money and then
they print more money inflation goes up

3434
00:57:56,390 --> 00:57:56,400
they print more money inflation goes up
 

3435
00:57:56,400 --> 00:57:59,270
they print more money inflation goes up
but also unemployment goes up

3436
00:57:59,270 --> 00:57:59,280
but also unemployment goes up
 

3437
00:57:59,280 --> 00:58:02,150
but also unemployment goes up
because this model is broken that's not

3438
00:58:02,150 --> 00:58:02,160
because this model is broken that's not
 

3439
00:58:02,160 --> 00:58:04,549
because this model is broken that's not
how the world works that's not the level

3440
00:58:04,549 --> 00:58:04,559
how the world works that's not the level
 

3441
00:58:04,559 --> 00:58:06,470
how the world works that's not the level
of aggregate spending in the economy is

3442
00:58:06,470 --> 00:58:06,480
of aggregate spending in the economy is
 

3443
00:58:06,480 --> 00:58:08,950
of aggregate spending in the economy is
not a lever with which you can control

3444
00:58:08,950 --> 00:58:08,960
not a lever with which you can control
 

3445
00:58:08,960 --> 00:58:11,750
not a lever with which you can control
inflation and unemployment so what would

3446
00:58:11,750 --> 00:58:11,760
inflation and unemployment so what would
 

3447
00:58:11,760 --> 00:58:14,150
inflation and unemployment so what would
a scientist do what would a non-huckster

3448
00:58:14,150 --> 00:58:14,160
a scientist do what would a non-huckster
 

3449
00:58:14,160 --> 00:58:17,190
a scientist do what would a non-huckster
do in this case

3450
00:58:17,190 --> 00:58:17,200

 

3451
00:58:17,200 --> 00:58:18,950

admit the theory is wrong and find

3452
00:58:18,950 --> 00:58:18,960
admit the theory is wrong and find
 

3453
00:58:18,960 --> 00:58:21,190
admit the theory is wrong and find
another way to reformulate it

3454
00:58:21,190 --> 00:58:21,200
another way to reformulate it
 

3455
00:58:21,200 --> 00:58:23,829
another way to reformulate it
have the keynesians done that no still

3456
00:58:23,829 --> 00:58:23,839
have the keynesians done that no still
 

3457
00:58:23,839 --> 00:58:25,589
have the keynesians done that no still
the same garbage in the textbook that is

3458
00:58:25,589 --> 00:58:25,599
the same garbage in the textbook that is
 

3459
00:58:25,599 --> 00:58:27,589
the same garbage in the textbook that is
being taught until today so is it

3460
00:58:27,589 --> 00:58:27,599
being taught until today so is it
 

3461
00:58:27,599 --> 00:58:29,750
being taught until today so is it
possible to have a non-kenzia motto well

3462
00:58:29,750 --> 00:58:29,760
possible to have a non-kenzia motto well
 

3463
00:58:29,760 --> 00:58:31,910
possible to have a non-kenzia motto well
one that still supports

3464
00:58:31,910 --> 00:58:31,920
one that still supports
 

3465
00:58:31,920 --> 00:58:33,670
one that still supports
moderate amount of inflation is good for

3466
00:58:33,670 --> 00:58:33,680
moderate amount of inflation is good for
 

3467
00:58:33,680 --> 00:58:36,390
moderate amount of inflation is good for
the economy i mean since the 1970s since

3468
00:58:36,390 --> 00:58:36,400
the economy i mean since the 1970s since
 

3469
00:58:36,400 --> 00:58:38,789
the economy i mean since the 1970s since
this has happened yeah this is what um

3470
00:58:38,789 --> 00:58:38,799
this has happened yeah this is what um
 

3471
00:58:38,799 --> 00:58:39,670
this has happened yeah this is what um
uh

we'll talk about

3484
00:58:49,990 --> 00:58:50,000
we'll talk about
 

3485
00:58:50,000 --> 00:58:51,270
we'll talk about
the effect of

00:58:55,680 --> 00:58:57,670
your book
uh fiat standard one of them is

3494
00:58:57,670 --> 00:58:57,680
uh fiat standard one of them is
 

3495
00:58:57,680 --> 00:58:59,589
uh fiat standard one of them is
education i'm sure we'll disagree there

3496
00:58:59,589 --> 00:58:59,599
education i'm sure we'll disagree there
 

3497
00:58:59,599 --> 00:59:00,309
education i'm sure we'll disagree there
too

3498
00:59:00,309 --> 00:59:00,319
too
 

3499
00:59:00,319 --> 00:59:02,470
too
um i'm not smart enough to disagree but

3500
00:59:02,470 --> 00:59:02,480
um i'm not smart enough to disagree but
 

3501
00:59:02,480 --> 00:59:04,789
um i'm not smart enough to disagree but
i'll disagree anyway so yeah so a whole

3502
00:59:04,789 --> 00:59:04,799
i'll disagree anyway so yeah so a whole
 

3503
00:59:04,799 --> 00:59:06,230
i'll disagree anyway so yeah so a whole
bunch of other models came up but

3504
00:59:06,230 --> 00:59:06,240
bunch of other models came up but
 

3505
00:59:06,240 --> 00:59:08,950
bunch of other models came up but
basically it's i mean it's it's such an

3506
00:59:08,950 --> 00:59:08,960
basically it's i mean it's it's such an
 

3507
00:59:08,960 --> 00:59:10,630
basically it's i mean it's it's such an
example of motivated reasoning like

3508
00:59:10,630 --> 00:59:10,640
example of motivated reasoning like
 

3509
00:59:10,640 --> 00:59:12,390
example of motivated reasoning like

flags and i remember when i used to

3518
00:59:20,230 --> 00:59:20,240
flags and i remember when i used to
 

3519
00:59:20,240 --> 00:59:22,870
flags and i remember when i used to
teach uh macroeconomics i used to teach

3520
00:59:22,870 --> 00:59:22,880
teach uh macroeconomics i used to teach
 

3521
00:59:22,880 --> 00:59:24,470
teach uh macroeconomics i used to teach
you know introductory macroeconomics and

3522
00:59:24,470 --> 00:59:24,480
you know introductory macroeconomics and
 

3523
00:59:24,480 --> 00:59:25,750
you know introductory macroeconomics and
it's a course that would be taken by

3524
00:59:25,750 --> 00:59:25,760
it's a course that would be taken by
 

3525
00:59:25,760 --> 00:59:27,750
it's a course that would be taken by
econ majors as well as engineers a lot

econ majors as well as engineers a lot
 

3527
00:59:27,760 --> 00:59:28,710

00:59:28,720 --> 00:59:30,950
of engineers would take it as an
elective and every time i'd explained

00:59:30,950 --> 00:59:30,960
elective and every time i'd explained
 

3531
00:59:30,960 --> 00:59:32,549

so both dance between micro and macro

3606
01:00:46,390 --> 01:00:46,400
so both dance between micro and macro

3622
01:01:01,910 --> 01:01:01,920
economics
 

3623
01:01:01,920 --> 01:01:03,670
economics
economics is the study the way the

3624
01:01:03,670 --> 01:01:03,680
economics is the study the way the

economics is the study the way the
austrians define it is the study of how

austrians define it is the study of how
 

3627
01:01:05,920 --> 01:01:08,150
austrians define it is the study of how
humans make choices under the condition

3628
01:01:08,150 --> 01:01:08,160
humans make choices under the condition
 

3629
01:01:08,160 --> 01:01:10,150
humans make choices under the condition
of scarcity we begin with the starting

3630
01:01:10,150 --> 01:01:10,160
of scarcity we begin with the starting
 

3631
01:01:10,160 --> 01:01:12,150
of scarcity we begin with the starting
point of economics as the fact that

3632
01:01:12,150 --> 01:01:12,160
point of economics as the fact that
 

3633
01:01:12,160 --> 01:01:14,069
point of economics as the fact that
scarcity exists

3634
01:01:14,069 --> 01:01:14,079
scarcity exists
 

3635
01:01:14,079 --> 01:01:14,950
scarcity exists
and

3636
01:01:14,950 --> 01:01:14,960
and
 

3637
01:01:14,960 --> 01:01:16,870
and
now why does scarcity exist well because

3638
01:01:16,870 --> 01:01:16,880
now why does scarcity exist well because
 

3639
01:01:16,880 --> 01:01:18,710
now why does scarcity exist well because
it's easier to want things than it is to

3640
01:01:18,710 --> 01:01:18,720
it's easier to want things than it is to
 

3641
01:01:18,720 --> 01:01:20,789
it's easier to want things than it is to
make them it's much easier to want a

3642
01:01:20,789 --> 01:01:20,799
make them it's much easier to want a
 

3643
01:01:20,799 --> 01:01:23,109
make them it's much easier to want a
ferrari than it is to make one

3644
01:01:23,109 --> 01:01:23,119
ferrari than it is to make one
 

3645
01:01:23,119 --> 01:01:26,950
ferrari than it is to make one
and so um because it's you know we have

3646
01:01:26,950 --> 01:01:26,960
and so um because it's you know we have
 

3647
01:01:26,960 --> 01:01:29,829
and so um because it's you know we have
once and we have limited means to meet

3648
01:01:29,829 --> 01:01:29,839
once and we have limited means to meet
 

3649
01:01:29,839 --> 01:01:32,630
once and we have limited means to meet
those ones we need to economize it's a

3650
01:01:32,630 --> 01:01:32,640
those ones we need to economize it's a
 

3651
01:01:32,640 --> 01:01:34,710
those ones we need to economize it's a
permanent

3652
01:01:34,710 --> 01:01:34,720
permanent
 

3653
01:01:34,720 --> 01:01:36,549
permanent
it's a permanent marker of the human

3654
01:01:36,549 --> 01:01:36,559
it's a permanent marker of the human
 

3655
01:01:36,559 --> 01:01:38,710
it's a permanent marker of the human
condition we are always economizing at

3656
01:01:38,710 --> 01:01:38,720
condition we are always economizing at
 

3657
01:01:38,720 --> 01:01:39,829
condition we are always economizing at
all times

3658
01:01:39,829 --> 01:01:39,839
all times
 

3659
01:01:39,839 --> 01:01:41,190
all times
and so

3660
01:01:41,190 --> 01:01:41,200
and so
 

3661
01:01:41,200 --> 01:01:43,510
and so
how people make those decisions under

3662
01:01:43,510 --> 01:01:43,520
how people make those decisions under
 

3663
01:01:43,520 --> 01:01:45,670
how people make those decisions under
the conditions of scarcity is what

3664
01:01:45,670 --> 01:01:45,680
the conditions of scarcity is what
 

3665
01:01:45,680 --> 01:01:47,430
the conditions of scarcity is what
economists study

3666
01:01:47,430 --> 01:01:47,440
economists study
 

3667
01:01:47,440 --> 01:01:49,030
economists study
so to go back to your point on

3668
01:01:49,030 --> 01:01:49,040
so to go back to your point on
 

3669
01:01:49,040 --> 01:01:51,270
so to go back to your point on
empiricism in austrian school

3670
01:01:51,270 --> 01:01:51,280
empiricism in austrian school
 

3671
01:01:51,280 --> 01:01:53,829
empiricism in austrian school
so it isn't that the austrians don't

3672
01:01:53,829 --> 01:01:53,839
so it isn't that the austrians don't
 

3673
01:01:53,839 --> 01:01:55,589
so it isn't that the austrians don't
believe in data

3674
01:01:55,589 --> 01:01:55,599
believe in data
 

3675
01:01:55,599 --> 01:01:58,069
believe in data
on the contrary it's that

3676
01:01:58,069 --> 01:01:58,079
on the contrary it's that
 

3677
01:01:58,079 --> 01:02:00,390
on the contrary it's that
theory has to inform data

3678
01:02:00,390 --> 01:02:00,400
theory has to inform data
 

3679
01:02:00,400 --> 01:02:02,710
theory has to inform data
and in fact if you think about it as the

3680
01:02:02,710 --> 01:02:02,720
and in fact if you think about it as the
 

3681
01:02:02,720 --> 01:02:04,309
and in fact if you think about it as the
example of the

3682
01:02:04,309 --> 01:02:04,319
example of the
 

3683
01:02:04,319 --> 01:02:08,150
example of the
stagflation of the 1970 shows

3684
01:02:08,150 --> 01:02:08,160
stagflation of the 1970 shows
 

3685
01:02:08,160 --> 01:02:10,870
stagflation of the 1970 shows
if you have stagflation that just

3686
01:02:10,870 --> 01:02:10,880
if you have stagflation that just
 

3687
01:02:10,880 --> 01:02:13,430
if you have stagflation that just
completely refutes the keynesian model

3688
01:02:13,430 --> 01:02:13,440
completely refutes the keynesian model
 

3689
01:02:13,440 --> 01:02:16,470
completely refutes the keynesian model
the austrian way of thinking which is

3690
01:02:16,470 --> 01:02:16,480
the austrian way of thinking which is

01:02:23,520 --> 01:02:25,270
economics is really all about human
action so it's not about

aggregates when you
when you introduce those aggregates you

01:02:52,230 --> 01:02:52,240
when you introduce those aggregates you
 

3729
01:02:52,240 --> 01:02:53,349
when you introduce those aggregates you
know how much

3730
01:02:53,349 --> 01:02:53,359
know how much
 

3731
01:02:53,359 --> 01:02:54,870
know how much
production takes place how many people

calculate the pressure calculate the

3756
01:03:19,670 --> 01:03:19,680
calculate the pressure calculate the
 

3757
01:03:19,680 --> 01:03:20,789
calculate the pressure calculate the
volume

3758
01:03:20,789 --> 01:03:20,799
volume
 

3759
01:03:20,799 --> 01:03:21,750
volume
and then

3760
01:03:21,750 --> 01:03:21,760
and then
 

3761
01:03:21,760 --> 01:03:24,309
and then
and and then the temperature you can you

3762
01:03:24,309 --> 01:03:24,319
and and then the temperature you can you
 

3763
01:03:24,319 --> 01:03:25,510
and and then the temperature you can you
if you have the pressure and volume you

3764
01:03:25,510 --> 01:03:25,520
if you have the pressure and volume you
 

3765
01:03:25,520 --> 01:03:26,630
if you have the pressure and volume you
can calculate the temperature because

3766
01:03:26,630 --> 01:03:26,640
can calculate the temperature because
 

3767
01:03:26,640 --> 01:03:28,829
can calculate the temperature because
you have the um ni

3768
01:03:28,829 --> 01:03:28,839
you have the um ni
 

3769
01:03:28,839 --> 01:03:31,670
you have the um ni
constants so there's a

3770
01:03:31,670 --> 01:03:31,680
constants so there's a
 

3771
01:03:31,680 --> 01:03:32,870
constants so there's a
clear relationship that has been

01:03:32,870 --> 01:03:32,880
clear relationship that has been
 

3773
01:03:32,880 --> 01:03:34,870
clear relationship that has been
demonstrated in a laboratory and that

3781
01:03:40,880 --> 01:03:43,270

one scientist to show that this
 

3783
01:03:43,280 --> 01:03:45,349
one scientist to show that this

that because we don't have experiments

that because we don't have experiments
but we can

3922

but we can
 

3923
01:06:07,680 --> 01:06:09,510
but we can
understand how the world actually works

3924
01:06:09,510 --> 01:06:09,520
understand how the world actually works
 

3925

they just want to copy the methods of
 

3931
01:06:14,480 --> 01:06:16,950
they just want to copy the methods of
physics and then that's just you know

3932
01:06:16,950 --> 01:06:16,960
physics and then that's just you know
 

3933
01:06:16,960 --> 01:06:18,470
physics and then that's just you know
uh gonna give them the certainty of the

3934
01:06:18,470 --> 01:06:18,480
uh gonna give them the certainty of the
 

3935
01:06:18,480 --> 01:06:19,910
uh gonna give them the certainty of the
results of physics which is like me

3936
01:06:19,910 --> 01:06:19,920
results of physics which is like me

3943
01:06:26,319 --> 01:06:27,589
fourth floor because i'm superman well
it's not the red blanket that's gonna

3944
01:06:27,589 --> 01:06:27,599
it's not the red blanket that's gonna
 

3945
01:06:27,599 --> 01:06:28,870
it's not the red blanket that's gonna
make me superman

there's a lot more to it so humility

3948
01:06:31,589 --> 01:06:31,599
there's a lot more to it so humility
 

3949
01:06:31,599 --> 01:06:33,670
there's a lot more to it so humility
manifests itself in economics as the

3953
01:06:35,520 --> 01:06:38,069
belief in a free market
meaning like i can't centralize i can't

3954
01:06:38,069 --> 01:06:38,079
meaning like i can't centralize i can't
 

3955
01:06:38,079 --> 01:06:41,029
meaning like i can't centralize i can't
do centralized control on this thing

01:06:44,309 --> 01:06:44,319
we're going to uh minimize the friction
 

3959
01:06:44,319 --> 01:06:47,349
we're going to uh minimize the friction
of the free exchange of goods

so um austrian economics puts priority

3962
01:06:50,710 --> 01:06:50,720
so um austrian economics puts priority
 

3963
01:06:50,720 --> 01:06:52,230
so um austrian economics puts priority
in in the market

tools from engineering apply them to
 

3989
01:07:13,520 --> 01:07:16,230
tools from engineering apply them to
economics and then we'll be able to plan

economics and then we'll be able to plan
 

3991

we can't have experiments and the reason

4008
01:07:29,990 --> 01:07:30,000
we can't have experiments and the reason
 

4009
01:07:30,000 --> 01:07:31,750
we can't have experiments and the reason
we can't have experiments is that you

4010
01:07:31,750 --> 01:07:31,760
we can't have experiments is that you
 

4011
01:07:31,760 --> 01:07:33,910
we can't have experiments is that you
can experiment on particles of a gas you

4012
01:07:33,910 --> 01:07:33,920
can experiment on particles of a gas you
 

4013
01:07:33,920 --> 01:07:35,829
can experiment on particles of a gas you
can't experiment on human beings on

4014
01:07:35,829 --> 01:07:35,839
can't experiment on human beings on
 

4015
01:07:35,839 --> 01:07:38,710
can't experiment on human beings on
entire economies and because

4016
01:07:38,710 --> 01:07:38,720
entire economies and because
 

4017
01:07:38,720 --> 01:07:42,069
entire economies and because
particles of a gas are just dumb matter

4018
01:07:42,069 --> 01:07:42,079
particles of a gas are just dumb matter
 

4019
01:07:42,079 --> 01:07:45,190
particles of a gas are just dumb matter
and so you know you you kick matter in a

4020
01:07:45,190 --> 01:07:45,200
and so you know you you kick matter in a
 

4021
01:07:45,200 --> 01:07:47,109
and so you know you you kick matter in a
certain way you can calculate exactly

4022
01:07:47,109 --> 01:07:47,119
certain way you can calculate exactly
 

4023
01:07:47,119 --> 01:07:49,190
certain way you can calculate exactly
how much is going to fly human beings

4024
01:07:49,190 --> 01:07:49,200
how much is going to fly human beings
 

4025
01:07:49,200 --> 01:07:51,029
how much is going to fly human beings
are much more complex they have a will

4026
01:07:51,029 --> 01:07:51,039
are much more complex they have a will
 

4027
01:07:51,039 --> 01:07:52,870
are much more complex they have a will
inside them and this is really

4028
01:07:52,870 --> 01:07:52,880
inside them and this is really
 

4029
01:07:52,880 --> 01:07:55,190
inside them and this is really
the this is the humility to understand

4030
01:07:55,190 --> 01:07:55,200
the this is the humility to understand
 

4031
01:07:55,200 --> 01:07:56,789
the this is the humility to understand
that you are a human being and other

4032
01:07:56,789 --> 01:07:56,799
that you are a human being and other
 

4033
01:07:56,799 --> 01:07:58,549
that you are a human being and other
people are also a human being just like

4034
01:07:58,549 --> 01:07:58,559
people are also a human being just like
 

4035
01:07:58,559 --> 01:07:59,270
people are also a human being just like
you

4036
01:07:59,270 --> 01:07:59,280
you
 

4037
01:07:59,280 --> 01:08:00,309
you
and that

4038
01:08:00,309 --> 01:08:00,319
and that
 

4039
01:08:00,319 --> 01:08:02,870
and that
the the you know every person wakes up

4040
01:08:02,870 --> 01:08:02,880
the the you know every person wakes up
 

4041
01:08:02,880 --> 01:08:04,870
the the you know every person wakes up
every morning and they have a million

4042
01:08:04,870 --> 01:08:04,880
every morning and they have a million
 

4043
01:08:04,880 --> 01:08:06,870
every morning and they have a million
things in their mind a million things

4044
01:08:06,870 --> 01:08:06,880
things in their mind a million things
 

4045
01:08:06,880 --> 01:08:08,230
things in their mind a million things
they care about a million things they

4046
01:08:08,230 --> 01:08:08,240
they care about a million things they
 

4047
01:08:08,240 --> 01:08:09,349
they care about a million things they
want to do

4048
01:08:09,349 --> 01:08:09,359
want to do
 

4049
01:08:09,359 --> 01:08:10,470
want to do
and

4050
01:08:10,470 --> 01:08:10,480
and
 

4051
01:08:10,480 --> 01:08:12,630
and
you will never be able to make the

4052
01:08:12,630 --> 01:08:12,640
you will never be able to make the
 

4053
01:08:12,640 --> 01:08:14,789
you will never be able to make the
decisions for somebody else let alone

4054
01:08:14,789 --> 01:08:14,799
decisions for somebody else let alone
 

4055
01:08:14,799 --> 01:08:16,950
decisions for somebody else let alone
for millions of other people so this is

4056
01:08:16,950 --> 01:08:16,960
for millions of other people so this is
 

4057
01:08:16,960 --> 01:08:18,390
for millions of other people so this is
one path by which you arrive at the

4058
01:08:18,390 --> 01:08:18,400
one path by which you arrive at the
 

4059
01:08:18,400 --> 01:08:19,910
one path by which you arrive at the
conclusion that free markets are better

4060
01:08:19,910 --> 01:08:19,920
conclusion that free markets are better
 

4061
01:08:19,920 --> 01:08:21,590
conclusion that free markets are better
because you realize that all the people

4062
01:08:21,590 --> 01:08:21,600
because you realize that all the people
 

4063
01:08:21,600 --> 01:08:23,510
because you realize that all the people
that think that they can centrally plan

4064
01:08:23,510 --> 01:08:23,520
that think that they can centrally plan
 

4065
01:08:23,520 --> 01:08:24,630
that think that they can centrally plan
markets

4066
01:08:24,630 --> 01:08:24,640
markets
 

4067
01:08:24,640 --> 01:08:26,789
markets
can't actually do that

4068
01:08:26,789 --> 01:08:26,799
can't actually do that
 

4069
01:08:26,799 --> 01:08:29,189
can't actually do that
and that there's really

4070
01:08:29,189 --> 01:08:29,199
and that there's really
 

4071
01:08:29,199 --> 01:08:30,789
and that there's really
nothing scientific about them except

4072
01:08:30,789 --> 01:08:30,799
nothing scientific about them except
 

4073
01:08:30,799 --> 01:08:33,510
nothing scientific about them except
essentially the rituals they ape of the

4074
01:08:33,510 --> 01:08:33,520
essentially the rituals they ape of the
 

4075
01:08:33,520 --> 01:08:35,189
essentially the rituals they ape of the
scientific process

4076
01:08:35,189 --> 01:08:35,199
scientific process
 

4077
01:08:35,199 --> 01:08:37,430
scientific process
and the other path i think that iran

4078
01:08:37,430 --> 01:08:37,440
and the other path i think that iran
 

4079
01:08:37,440 --> 01:08:39,510
and the other path i think that iran
makes you arrive at the austrian

4080
01:08:39,510 --> 01:08:39,520
makes you arrive at the austrian
 

4081
01:08:39,520 --> 01:08:40,789
makes you arrive at the austrian
perspective or the libertarian

4082
01:08:40,789 --> 01:08:40,799
perspective or the libertarian
 

4083
01:08:40,799 --> 01:08:42,390
perspective or the libertarian
perspective i should say

4084
01:08:42,390 --> 01:08:42,400
perspective i should say
 

4085
01:08:42,400 --> 01:08:43,749
perspective i should say
is

4086
01:08:43,749 --> 01:08:43,759
is
 

4087
01:08:43,759 --> 01:08:46,950
is
simply the the the notion of individuals

4088
01:08:46,950 --> 01:08:46,960
simply the the the notion of individuals
 

4089
01:08:46,960 --> 01:08:49,669
simply the the the notion of individuals
as having their own inalienable right to

as having their own inalienable right to

themselves if you
i mean the only way that you can give

i mean the only way that you can give
 

4097
01:08:55,120 --> 01:08:58,229
i mean the only way that you can give
yourself the idea that um you get to be

you know which is let's force a bunch of

4122
01:09:22,630 --> 01:09:22,640
you know which is let's force a bunch of
 

4123
01:09:22,640 --> 01:09:24,470
you know which is let's force a bunch of
particles to sit in a lab so that we can

4124
01:09:24,470 --> 01:09:24,480
particles to sit in a lab so that we can
 

4125
01:09:24,480 --> 01:09:25,990
particles to sit in a lab so that we can
study them

4126
01:09:25,990 --> 01:09:26,000
study them
 

4127
01:09:26,000 --> 01:09:27,829
study them
in economics you're forcing people to do

4128
01:09:27,829 --> 01:09:27,839
in economics you're forcing people to do
 

4129
01:09:27,839 --> 01:09:29,829
in economics you're forcing people to do
things you know that's stop these people

things you know that's stop these people
 

4131
01:09:29,839 --> 01:09:31,749
things you know that's stop these people
from doing this job because it's bad for

4132
01:09:31,749 --> 01:09:31,759
from doing this job because it's bad for
 

4133
01:09:31,759 --> 01:09:33,110
from doing this job because it's bad for
the economy and let's get them to do

4134
01:09:33,110 --> 01:09:33,120
the economy and let's get them to do
 

4135
01:09:33,120 --> 01:09:35,189
the economy and let's get them to do
that job let's force them to pay this

4136
01:09:35,189 --> 01:09:35,199
that job let's force them to pay this
 

4137
01:09:35,199 --> 01:09:37,590
that job let's force them to pay this
price let's tax them this much let's

4138
01:09:37,590 --> 01:09:37,600
price let's tax them this much let's
 

4139
01:09:37,600 --> 01:09:39,349
price let's tax them this much let's
prevent them from using gold as money

4140
01:09:39,349 --> 01:09:39,359
prevent them from using gold as money
 

4141
01:09:39,359 --> 01:09:41,510
prevent them from using gold as money
and force them to use our credit as

4142
01:09:41,510 --> 01:09:41,520
and force them to use our credit as
 

4143
01:09:41,520 --> 01:09:44,390
and force them to use our credit as
money so it has to rely on coercion

4144
01:09:44,390 --> 01:09:44,400
money so it has to rely on coercion
 

4145
01:09:44,400 --> 01:09:45,749
money so it has to rely on coercion
there's no central planning without

there's no central planning without

01:09:45,759 --> 01:09:48,709
there's no central planning without

broadly speaking of the libertarian view

things in the modern scientific way well
 

4237
01:11:22,880 --> 01:11:24,630
things in the modern scientific way well
so what about things like

4238
01:11:24,630 --> 01:11:24,640
so what about things like
 

4239
01:11:24,640 --> 01:11:27,510
so what about things like
that all of us use so infrastructure for

uh
 

4247
01:11:35,040 --> 01:11:37,510
uh
can you make a case

4248
01:11:37,510 --> 01:11:37,520
can you make a case
 

4249
01:11:37,520 --> 01:11:39,110
can you make a case
for the role of

4250
01:11:39,110 --> 01:11:39,120
for the role of
 

4251
01:11:39,120 --> 01:11:41,910
for the role of
some large-scale centralized systems

whether it's government or not that do

whether it's government or not that do
 

4255
01:11:43,840 --> 01:11:46,149
whether it's government or not that do
this kind of management i guess perhaps

4256
01:11:46,149 --> 01:11:46,159
this kind of management i guess perhaps
 

4257
01:11:46,159 --> 01:11:47,990
this kind of management i guess perhaps
you could say there's the economies of

4258
01:11:47,990 --> 01:11:48,000
you could say there's the economies of
 

4259
01:11:48,000 --> 01:11:49,590
you could say there's the economies of
scale argument that some things must

4260
01:11:49,590 --> 01:11:49,600
scale argument that some things must
 

4261
01:11:49,600 --> 01:11:52,149
scale argument that some things must
exist at a very hard a very large scale

4262
01:11:52,149 --> 01:11:52,159
exist at a very hard a very large scale
 

4263
01:11:52,159 --> 01:11:55,110
exist at a very hard a very large scale
and therefore you would want um you

4264
01:11:55,110 --> 01:11:55,120
and therefore you would want um you
 

4265
01:11:55,120 --> 01:11:56,790
and therefore you would want um you
would want political accountability of

4266
01:11:56,790 --> 01:11:56,800
would want political accountability of
 

4267
01:11:56,800 --> 01:11:58,390
would want political accountability of
the people who manage them this is kind

4268
01:11:58,390 --> 01:11:58,400
the people who manage them this is kind
 

4269
01:11:58,400 --> 01:11:59,990
the people who manage them this is kind
of the argument that's given for

4270
01:11:59,990 --> 01:12:00,000
of the argument that's given for
 

4271
01:12:00,000 --> 01:12:01,430
of the argument that's given for
infrastructure monopolies you know for

um

4276
01:12:04,870 --> 01:12:04,880
um
 

4277
01:12:04,880 --> 01:12:07,030
um
that let's say we live in a country we

4278
01:12:07,030 --> 01:12:07,040
that let's say we live in a country we
 

4279
01:12:07,040 --> 01:12:08,390
that let's say we live in a country we
need one power plant the bigger the

4280
01:12:08,390 --> 01:12:08,400
need one power plant the bigger the
 

4281
01:12:08,400 --> 01:12:10,229
need one power plant the bigger the
power plant the better off we will all

4282
01:12:10,229 --> 01:12:10,239
power plant the better off we will all
 

4283
01:12:10,239 --> 01:12:11,030
power plant the better off we will all
be

4284
01:12:11,030 --> 01:12:11,040
be
 

4285
01:12:11,040 --> 01:12:13,510
be
and there's a natural monopoly in the

4286
01:12:13,510 --> 01:12:13,520
and there's a natural monopoly in the
 

4287
01:12:13,520 --> 01:12:15,350
and there's a natural monopoly in the
power plant business so we're going to

4288
01:12:15,350 --> 01:12:15,360
power plant business so we're going to
 

4289
01:12:15,360 --> 01:12:17,350
power plant business so we're going to
have to have one power plant and since

4290
01:12:17,350 --> 01:12:17,360
have to have one power plant and since
 

4291
01:12:17,360 --> 01:12:19,669
have to have one power plant and since
there's only one power plant then we

4292
01:12:19,669 --> 01:12:19,679
there's only one power plant then we
 

4293
01:12:19,679 --> 01:12:21,510
there's only one power plant then we
can't just let anybody

4294
01:12:21,510 --> 01:12:21,520
can't just let anybody
 

4295
01:12:21,520 --> 01:12:22,709
can't just let anybody
own it because then they're going to

4296
01:12:22,709 --> 01:12:22,719
own it because then they're going to
 

4297
01:12:22,719 --> 01:12:24,790
own it because then they're going to
make it too expensive so we need to have

4298
01:12:24,790 --> 01:12:24,800
make it too expensive so we need to have
 

4299
01:12:24,800 --> 01:12:26,870
make it too expensive so we need to have
the government own it so it can make it

4300
01:12:26,870 --> 01:12:26,880
the government own it so it can make it
 

4301
01:12:26,880 --> 01:12:29,030
the government own it so it can make it
too expensive and you don't find that

4302
01:12:29,030 --> 01:12:29,040
too expensive and you don't find that
 

4303
01:12:29,040 --> 01:12:30,709
too expensive and you don't find that
case compelling not at all i used to

and no i don't find that compelling at
 

4313
01:12:39,920 --> 01:12:41,990
and no i don't find that compelling at
all because i think all these examples

4314
01:12:41,990 --> 01:12:42,000
all because i think all these examples
 

4315
01:12:42,000 --> 01:12:43,910
all because i think all these examples
that they mention of natural monopolies

01:12:54,320 --> 01:12:55,990
power plants
and then there's only one power plant

4328
01:12:55,990 --> 01:12:56,000
and then there's only one power plant
 

4329
01:12:56,000 --> 01:12:58,070
and then there's only one power plant
and they need to be in charge of it

4330
01:12:58,070 --> 01:12:58,080
and they need to be in charge of it
 

4331
01:12:58,080 --> 01:12:59,990
and they need to be in charge of it
but in reality

4332
01:12:59,990 --> 01:13:00,000
but in reality
 

4333
01:13:00,000 --> 01:13:01,030
but in reality
um

4334
01:13:01,030 --> 01:13:01,040
um
 

4335
01:13:01,040 --> 01:13:03,110
um
no in reality the you know power plants

4336
01:13:03,110 --> 01:13:03,120
no in reality the you know power plants
 

4337
01:13:03,120 --> 01:13:04,550
no in reality the you know power plants
can exist at all kinds of manners of

4338
01:13:04,550 --> 01:13:04,560
can exist at all kinds of manners of
 

4339
01:13:04,560 --> 01:13:06,790
can exist at all kinds of manners of
scales of operation and yes of course

4340
01:13:06,790 --> 01:13:06,800
scales of operation and yes of course
 

4341
01:13:06,800 --> 01:13:09,030
scales of operation and yes of course
there are benefits to centralization in

4342
01:13:09,030 --> 01:13:09,040
there are benefits to centralization in
 

4343
01:13:09,040 --> 01:13:10,470
there are benefits to centralization in
power plants in particular because

4344
01:13:10,470 --> 01:13:10,480
power plants in particular because
 

4345
01:13:10,480 --> 01:13:12,470
power plants in particular because
there's efficiency in uh generation you

4346
01:13:12,470 --> 01:13:12,480
there's efficiency in uh generation you
 

4347
01:13:12,480 --> 01:13:14,070
there's efficiency in uh generation you
know one

4348
01:13:14,070 --> 01:13:14,080
know one
 

4349
01:13:14,080 --> 01:13:16,950
know one
big uh power plant is more efficient

4350
01:13:16,950 --> 01:13:16,960
big uh power plant is more efficient
 

4351
01:13:16,960 --> 01:13:19,830
big uh power plant is more efficient
than 10 equivalent smaller power plants

4352
01:13:19,830 --> 01:13:19,840
than 10 equivalent smaller power plants
 

4353
01:13:19,840 --> 01:13:21,350
than 10 equivalent smaller power plants
but there's also inefficiencies in

4354
01:13:21,350 --> 01:13:21,360
but there's also inefficiencies in
 

4355
01:13:21,360 --> 01:13:22,870
but there's also inefficiencies in
centralization because the more

4356
01:13:22,870 --> 01:13:22,880
centralization because the more
 

4357
01:13:22,880 --> 01:13:25,430
centralization because the more
centralized and the bigger the plant is

4358
01:13:25,430 --> 01:13:25,440
centralized and the bigger the plant is
 

4359
01:13:25,440 --> 01:13:28,630
centralized and the bigger the plant is
the further away a lot of the

4360
01:13:28,630 --> 01:13:28,640
the further away a lot of the
 

4361
01:13:28,640 --> 01:13:29,990
the further away a lot of the
population is going to be so you're

4362
01:13:29,990 --> 01:13:30,000
population is going to be so you're
 

4363
01:13:30,000 --> 01:13:31,189
population is going to be so you're
going to be losing a lot of the

4364
01:13:31,189 --> 01:13:31,199
going to be losing a lot of the
 

4365
01:13:31,199 --> 01:13:33,430
going to be losing a lot of the
electricity and transmission

4366
01:13:33,430 --> 01:13:33,440
electricity and transmission
 

4367
01:13:33,440 --> 01:13:35,110
electricity and transmission
and you believe the free market is best

4368
01:13:35,110 --> 01:13:35,120
and you believe the free market is best
 

4369
01:13:35,120 --> 01:13:37,910
and you believe the free market is best
in managing that dance that balance of

4370
01:13:37,910 --> 01:13:37,920
in managing that dance that balance of
 

4371
01:13:37,920 --> 01:13:39,189
in managing that dance that balance of
centralization

4372

centralization
 

4373
01:13:39,199 --> 01:13:41,030
centralization
exactly and if we do end up in a

4374
01:13:41,030 --> 01:13:41,040
exactly and if we do end up in a
 

4375
01:13:41,040 --> 01:13:42,709
exactly and if we do end up in a
situation where there's one power plant

4376
01:13:42,709 --> 01:13:42,719
situation where there's one power plant
 

4377
01:13:42,719 --> 01:13:44,310
situation where there's one power plant
for an area

4378
01:13:44,310 --> 01:13:44,320
for an area
 

4379
01:13:44,320 --> 01:13:47,510
for an area
then i you know if the markets uh ends

4380
01:13:47,510 --> 01:13:47,520
then i you know if the markets uh ends
 

4381
01:13:47,520 --> 01:13:49,590
then i you know if the markets uh ends
up centralizing all of it into one power

4382
01:13:49,590 --> 01:13:49,600
up centralizing all of it into one power
 

4383
01:13:49,600 --> 01:13:52,630
up centralizing all of it into one power
plant i don't see that as a problem um

4384
01:13:52,630 --> 01:13:52,640
plant i don't see that as a problem um
 

4385
01:13:52,640 --> 01:13:54,229
plant i don't see that as a problem um
there are places you know there's a

4386
01:13:54,229 --> 01:13:54,239
there are places you know there's a
 

4387
01:13:54,239 --> 01:13:56,070
there are places you know there's a
small town with only one barber shop is

4388
01:13:56,070 --> 01:13:56,080
small town with only one barber shop is
 

4389
01:13:56,080 --> 01:13:58,630
small town with only one barber shop is
that a catastrophe no because

4390
01:13:58,630 --> 01:13:58,640
that a catastrophe no because
 

4391
01:13:58,640 --> 01:14:01,030
that a catastrophe no because
um they don't need two barbershops now

4392
01:14:01,030 --> 01:14:01,040
um they don't need two barbershops now
 

4393
01:14:01,040 --> 01:14:02,470
um they don't need two barbershops now
if that barbershop started to take

4394
01:14:02,470 --> 01:14:02,480
if that barbershop started to take
 

4395
01:14:02,480 --> 01:14:04,149
if that barbershop started to take
advantage of people started to charge

4396
01:14:04,149 --> 01:14:04,159
advantage of people started to charge
 

4397
01:14:04,159 --> 01:14:06,390
advantage of people started to charge
higher price well then that's just an

4398
01:14:06,390 --> 01:14:06,400
higher price well then that's just an
 

4399
01:14:06,400 --> 01:14:08,550
higher price well then that's just an
opportunity for others to step in and

4400
01:14:08,550 --> 01:14:08,560
opportunity for others to step in and
 

4401
01:14:08,560 --> 01:14:10,229
opportunity for others to step in and
put them in their place and that's the

4402
01:14:10,229 --> 01:14:10,239
put them in their place and that's the
 

4403
01:14:10,239 --> 01:14:11,510
put them in their place and that's the
same thing with power plants it's the

4404
01:14:11,510 --> 01:14:11,520
same thing with power plants it's the
 

4405
01:14:11,520 --> 01:14:13,030
same thing with power plants it's the
same thing with everything

4406
01:14:13,030 --> 01:14:13,040
same thing with everything
 

4407
01:14:13,040 --> 01:14:14,790
same thing with everything
um ultimately

4408
01:14:14,790 --> 01:14:14,800
um ultimately
 

4409
01:14:14,800 --> 01:14:17,350
um ultimately
i think the key thing is this

4410
01:14:17,350 --> 01:14:17,360
i think the key thing is this
 

4411
01:14:17,360 --> 01:14:20,070
i think the key thing is this
from the central planning perspective

4412
01:14:20,070 --> 01:14:20,080
from the central planning perspective
 

4413
01:14:20,080 --> 01:14:22,550
from the central planning perspective
they'll present you the problem as it is

4414
01:14:22,550 --> 01:14:22,560
they'll present you the problem as it is
 

4415
01:14:22,560 --> 01:14:24,950
they'll present you the problem as it is
and they'll tell you well this is bad so

4416
01:14:24,950 --> 01:14:24,960
and they'll tell you well this is bad so
 

4417
01:14:24,960 --> 01:14:27,510
and they'll tell you well this is bad so
the fix you know and and what we can do

4418
01:14:27,510 --> 01:14:27,520
the fix you know and and what we can do
 

4419
01:14:27,520 --> 01:14:29,990
the fix you know and and what we can do
is better so let's stop what's bad

4420
01:14:29,990 --> 01:14:30,000
is better so let's stop what's bad
 

4421
01:14:30,000 --> 01:14:31,750
is better so let's stop what's bad
and do what is better

4422
01:14:31,750 --> 01:14:31,760
and do what is better
 

4423
01:14:31,760 --> 01:14:33,830
and do what is better
two problems here usually the reason

4424
01:14:33,830 --> 01:14:33,840
two problems here usually the reason
 

4425
01:14:33,840 --> 01:14:35,510
two problems here usually the reason
that the thing is bad in the first place

4426
01:14:35,510 --> 01:14:35,520
that the thing is bad in the first place
 

4427
01:14:35,520 --> 01:14:37,030
that the thing is bad in the first place
is because it is a government monopoly

4428
01:14:37,030 --> 01:14:37,040
is because it is a government monopoly
 

4429
01:14:37,040 --> 01:14:39,110
is because it is a government monopoly
is because of government intervention

4430
01:14:39,110 --> 01:14:39,120
is because of government intervention
 

4431
01:14:39,120 --> 01:14:41,750
is because of government intervention
but the second thing is that this notion

4432
01:14:41,750 --> 01:14:41,760
but the second thing is that this notion
 

4433
01:14:41,760 --> 01:14:43,350
but the second thing is that this notion
that we could just pass a law and fix

4434
01:14:43,350 --> 01:14:43,360
that we could just pass a law and fix
 

4435
01:14:43,360 --> 01:14:45,669
that we could just pass a law and fix
what's wrong and make it better

4436
01:14:45,669 --> 01:14:45,679
what's wrong and make it better
 

4437
01:14:45,679 --> 01:14:47,189
what's wrong and make it better
is

4438
01:14:47,189 --> 01:14:47,199
is
 

4439
01:14:47,199 --> 01:14:49,110
is
it ignores the fundamental underlying

4440
01:14:49,110 --> 01:14:49,120
it ignores the fundamental underlying
 

4441
01:14:49,120 --> 01:14:51,430
it ignores the fundamental underlying
reality which is that what you're doing

4442
01:14:51,430 --> 01:14:51,440
reality which is that what you're doing
 

4443
01:14:51,440 --> 01:14:54,310
reality which is that what you're doing
is you're offering only one way for this

4444
01:14:54,310 --> 01:14:54,320
is you're offering only one way for this
 

4445
01:14:54,320 --> 01:14:56,149
is you're offering only one way for this
problem to be solved and making all

4446
01:14:56,149 --> 01:14:56,159
problem to be solved and making all
 

4447
01:14:56,159 --> 01:14:58,229
problem to be solved and making all
other solutions practically illegal

other solutions practically illegal
you're taking taxpayer money you're

4450
01:15:00,149 --> 01:15:00,159
you're taking taxpayer money you're
 

4451
01:15:00,159 --> 01:15:02,229
you're taking taxpayer money you're
putting guns to people's heads to take

putting guns to people's heads to take
 

4453

putting guns to people's heads to take
their money to use it to build say this

one solution for a power plant but

4456
01:15:06,070 --> 01:15:06,080
one solution for a power plant but
 

4457
01:15:06,080 --> 01:15:07,990
one solution for a power plant but
you're preventing the free market

4458
01:15:07,990 --> 01:15:08,000
you're preventing the free market
 

4459
01:15:08,000 --> 01:15:10,470
you're preventing the free market
process from providing us with other

process from providing us with other
 

4461
01:15:10,480 --> 01:15:12,550

alternatives well so you phrased it sort

4462
01:15:12,550 --> 01:15:12,560
alternatives well so you phrased it sort
 

4463
01:15:12,560 --> 01:15:14,550
alternatives well so you phrased it sort
of from that perspective but there in

4464
01:15:14,550 --> 01:15:14,560
of from that perspective but there in
 

4465
01:15:14,560 --> 01:15:16,550
of from that perspective but there in
theory there is a feedback

4466
01:15:16,550 --> 01:15:16,560
theory there is a feedback
 

4467
01:15:16,560 --> 01:15:19,030

01:15:37,270 --> 01:15:37,280
mechanism
 

4487
01:15:37,280 --> 01:15:38,390
mechanism
and i think

4488
01:15:38,390 --> 01:15:38,400
and i think
 

4489
01:15:38,400 --> 01:15:40,709
and i think
i personally believe it is a selection

4490
01:15:40,709 --> 01:15:40,719
i personally believe it is a selection
 

4491
01:15:40,719 --> 01:15:43,590
i personally believe it is a selection
mechanism that has worked in the past it

4492
01:15:43,590 --> 01:15:43,600
mechanism that has worked in the past it
 

4493
01:15:43,600 --> 01:15:45,669
mechanism that has worked in the past it
just often does not work

4494
01:15:45,669 --> 01:15:45,679
just often does not work
 

4495
01:15:45,679 --> 01:15:48,709
just often does not work
and nearly as well as a free market and

4496
01:15:48,709 --> 01:15:48,719
and nearly as well as a free market and
 

4497
01:15:48,719 --> 01:15:51,830
and nearly as well as a free market and
the question is are there

4498
01:15:51,830 --> 01:15:51,840
the question is are there
 

4499
01:15:51,840 --> 01:15:53,430
the question is are there
in which the free market gets itself

4500
01:15:53,430 --> 01:15:53,440
in which the free market gets itself
 

4501
01:15:53,440 --> 01:15:54,630
in which the free market gets itself
into trouble

4502
01:15:54,630 --> 01:15:54,640
into trouble
 

4503
01:15:54,640 --> 01:15:55,669
into trouble
so this

4504
01:15:55,669 --> 01:15:55,679
so this
 

4505
01:15:55,679 --> 01:15:58,390
so this
theoretical view is that that's the

4506
01:15:58,390 --> 01:15:58,400
theoretical view is that that's the
 

4507
01:15:58,400 --> 01:16:00,790
theoretical view is that that's the
point of a free market is it doesn't if

4508
01:16:00,790 --> 01:16:00,800
point of a free market is it doesn't if
 

4509
01:16:00,800 --> 01:16:02,790
point of a free market is it doesn't if
there's trouble

4510
01:16:02,790 --> 01:16:02,800
there's trouble
 

4511
01:16:02,800 --> 01:16:04,870
there's trouble
that's a signal and it will respond to

4512
01:16:04,870 --> 01:16:04,880
that's a signal and it will respond to
 

4513
01:16:04,880 --> 01:16:06,709
that's a signal and it will respond to
that signal and it will respond

4514
01:16:06,709 --> 01:16:06,719
that signal and it will respond
 

4515
01:16:06,719 --> 01:16:08,790
that signal and it will respond
appropriately to make you try to

4516
01:16:08,790 --> 01:16:08,800
appropriately to make you try to
 

4517
01:16:08,800 --> 01:16:11,110
appropriately to make you try to
maximize happiness the question is is

4518
01:16:11,110 --> 01:16:11,120
maximize happiness the question is is
 

4519
01:16:11,120 --> 01:16:13,510
maximize happiness the question is is
there a local optima that free markets

4520
01:16:13,510 --> 01:16:13,520
there a local optima that free markets
 

4521
01:16:13,520 --> 01:16:16,390
there a local optima that free markets
get stuck in and you need governments

4522
01:16:16,390 --> 01:16:16,400
get stuck in and you need governments
 

4523
01:16:16,400 --> 01:16:18,550
get stuck in and you need governments
to represent the broader scale of the

4524
01:16:18,550 --> 01:16:18,560
to represent the broader scale of the
 

4525
01:16:18,560 --> 01:16:20,709
to represent the broader scale of the
people yeah well here's out of that i

4526
01:16:20,709 --> 01:16:20,719
people yeah well here's out of that i
 

4527
01:16:20,719 --> 01:16:23,510
people yeah well here's out of that i
think the fundamental problem here is

4528
01:16:23,510 --> 01:16:23,520
think the fundamental problem here is
 

4529
01:16:23,520 --> 01:16:25,189
think the fundamental problem here is
the idea that there is a feedback

4530
01:16:25,189 --> 01:16:25,199
the idea that there is a feedback
 

4531
01:16:25,199 --> 01:16:28,229
the idea that there is a feedback
mechanism when there is coercion in one

01:16:28,229 --> 01:16:28,239
mechanism when there is coercion in one
 

4533
01:16:28,239 --> 01:16:30,790
mechanism when there is coercion in one
party when one party can employ coercion

4534
01:16:30,790 --> 01:16:30,800

all jokes but yes i i mean the people

4570
01:17:02,950 --> 01:17:02,960
all jokes but yes i i mean the people
 

4571
01:17:02,960 --> 01:17:05,669
all jokes but yes i i mean the people
don't often think of it as gun to the as

4572
01:17:05,669 --> 01:17:05,679
don't often think of it as gun to the as
 

4573
01:17:05,679 --> 01:17:08,229
don't often think of it as gun to the as
government and the military

government and the military
 

4575
01:17:08,239 --> 01:17:10,709
government and the military
as gun to the head

4576
01:17:10,709 --> 01:17:10,719
as gun to the head
 

4577
01:17:10,719 --> 01:17:13,030
as gun to the head
um but that is sort of a libertarian

4578
01:17:13,030 --> 01:17:13,040
um but that is sort of a libertarian
 

4579
01:17:13,040 --> 01:17:15,270
um but that is sort of a libertarian
perspective because ultimately when you

4580
01:17:15,270 --> 01:17:15,280
perspective because ultimately when you
 

4581
01:17:15,280 --> 01:17:16,870
perspective because ultimately when you
you know turtles all the way down and at

4582
01:17:16,870 --> 01:17:16,880
you know turtles all the way down and at
 

4583
01:17:16,880 --> 01:17:18,630
you know turtles all the way down and at
the bottom there's guns

4584
01:17:18,630 --> 01:17:18,640
the bottom there's guns
 

4585
01:17:18,640 --> 01:17:20,630
the bottom there's guns
yeah so bottom if you don't want to pay

4586
01:17:20,630 --> 01:17:20,640
yeah so bottom if you don't want to pay
 

4587
01:17:20,640 --> 01:17:21,750
yeah so bottom if you don't want to pay
if you don't want to you know all right

4588
01:17:21,750 --> 01:17:21,760
if you don't want to you know all right

don't want to do it i don't want to pay
for it go to jail you can't not pay for

4596
01:17:28,070 --> 01:17:28,080
for it go to jail you can't not pay for
 

4597
01:17:28,080 --> 01:17:29,750
for it go to jail you can't not pay for
it that's really the symmetry which the

it that's really the symmetry which the

in my opinion it's not as if you know

01:17:33,830 --> 01:17:33,840
in my opinion it's not as if you know
 

4603
01:17:33,840 --> 01:17:36,070
in my opinion it's not as if you know
i'm being stubborn and stuck on the idea

at certain conclusions do you find an

4838
01:21:41,910 --> 01:21:41,920
at certain conclusions do you find an
 

4839
01:21:41,920 --> 01:21:43,350
at certain conclusions do you find an
interesting distinction we mentioned

4840
01:21:43,350 --> 01:21:43,360
interesting distinction we mentioned
 

4841
01:21:43,360 --> 01:21:45,189
interesting distinction we mentioned
michael malus between anarchism and

4842
01:21:45,189 --> 01:21:45,199
michael malus between anarchism and
 

4843
01:21:45,199 --> 01:21:46,709
michael malus between anarchism and
libertarianism

4844
01:21:46,709 --> 01:21:46,719
libertarianism
 

4845
01:21:46,719 --> 01:21:50,870
libertarianism
so this particular use of violence

4846
01:21:50,870 --> 01:21:50,880
so this particular use of violence
 

4847
01:21:50,880 --> 01:21:53,189
so this particular use of violence
this like last resort this policing

4848
01:21:53,189 --> 01:21:53,199
this like last resort this policing
 

4849
01:21:53,199 --> 01:21:56,149
this like last resort this policing
force that libertarianism is okay with

4850
01:21:56,149 --> 01:21:56,159
force that libertarianism is okay with
 

4851
01:21:56,159 --> 01:21:58,790
force that libertarianism is okay with
and uh anarchism is not okay with it so

4852
01:21:58,790 --> 01:21:58,800
and uh anarchism is not okay with it so
 

4853
01:21:58,800 --> 01:22:00,950
and uh anarchism is not okay with it so
basically nation states that

4854
01:22:00,950 --> 01:22:00,960
basically nation states that
 

4855
01:22:00,960 --> 01:22:04,070
basically nation states that
uh keep you safe from the worst of of

4856
01:22:04,070 --> 01:22:04,080
uh keep you safe from the worst of of
 

4857
01:22:04,080 --> 01:22:05,110
uh keep you safe from the worst of of
war

4858
01:22:05,110 --> 01:22:05,120
war
 

4859
01:22:05,120 --> 01:22:06,550
war
yeah i think to be more accurate the

4860
01:22:06,550 --> 01:22:06,560
yeah i think to be more accurate the
 

4861
01:22:06,560 --> 01:22:07,910
yeah i think to be more accurate the
distinctions between anarchism and

4862
01:22:07,910 --> 01:22:07,920
distinctions between anarchism and
 

4863
01:22:07,920 --> 01:22:10,149
distinctions between anarchism and
monarchism i think libertarianism is

4864
01:22:10,149 --> 01:22:10,159
monarchism i think libertarianism is
 

4865
01:22:10,159 --> 01:22:12,870
monarchism i think libertarianism is
kind of a vague term that can encompass

4866
01:22:12,870 --> 01:22:12,880
kind of a vague term that can encompass
 

4867
01:22:12,880 --> 01:22:15,110
kind of a vague term that can encompass
both these a lot of things okay yeah um

4868
01:22:15,110 --> 01:22:15,120
both these a lot of things okay yeah um
 

4869
01:22:15,120 --> 01:22:18,790
both these a lot of things okay yeah um
but on the uh karl marx to michael malus

i don't find any justification for the
 

4881
01:22:26,480 --> 01:22:29,830
i don't find any justification for the
use of force and i think um

4882
01:22:29,830 --> 01:22:29,840
use of force and i think um
 

4883
01:22:29,840 --> 01:22:32,310
use of force and i think um
recently perhaps i've maybe i'm getting

intellectually i'm an anarchist but it's

4908
01:23:00,629 --> 01:23:00,639
intellectually i'm an anarchist but it's
 

4909
01:23:00,639 --> 01:23:02,310
intellectually i'm an anarchist but it's
what the reality is we find ourselves in

4910
01:23:02,310 --> 01:23:02,320
what the reality is we find ourselves in
 

4911
01:23:02,320 --> 01:23:04,470
what the reality is we find ourselves in
a world in which um a lot of people are

4912
01:23:04,470 --> 01:23:04,480
a world in which um a lot of people are
 

4913
01:23:04,480 --> 01:23:05,510
a world in which um a lot of people are
not

4914
01:23:05,510 --> 01:23:05,520
not
 

4915
01:23:05,520 --> 01:23:08,470
not
and the question is um

4916
01:23:08,470 --> 01:23:08,480
and the question is um
 

4917
01:23:08,480 --> 01:23:09,830
and the question is um
what is the thing that is going to

4918
01:23:09,830 --> 01:23:09,840
what is the thing that is going to
 

4919
01:23:09,840 --> 01:23:12,629
what is the thing that is going to
provide you with more freedom

4920
01:23:12,629 --> 01:23:12,639
provide you with more freedom
 

4921
01:23:12,639 --> 01:23:14,709
provide you with more freedom
and um i think

4922
01:23:14,709 --> 01:23:14,719
and um i think
 

4923
01:23:14,719 --> 01:23:16,629
and um i think
i'm recently coming around to the idea

4924
01:23:16,629 --> 01:23:16,639
i'm recently coming around to the idea
 

4925
01:23:16,639 --> 01:23:20,229
i'm recently coming around to the idea
that monarchy might be the best way to

4926
01:23:20,229 --> 01:23:20,239
that monarchy might be the best way to
 

4927
01:23:20,239 --> 01:23:21,510
that monarchy might be the best way to
provide people with the largest amount

4928
01:23:21,510 --> 01:23:21,520
provide people with the largest amount
 

4929
01:23:21,520 --> 01:23:23,030
provide people with the largest amount
of freedom because

4930
01:23:23,030 --> 01:23:23,040
of freedom because
 

4931
01:23:23,040 --> 01:23:25,030
of freedom because
to have a free society you need a

4932
01:23:25,030 --> 01:23:25,040
to have a free society you need a
 

4933
01:23:25,040 --> 01:23:27,590
to have a free society you need a
majority perhaps or a plurality of

4934
01:23:27,590 --> 01:23:27,600
majority perhaps or a plurality of
 

4935
01:23:27,600 --> 01:23:29,350
majority perhaps or a plurality of
people to have a very strong

4936
01:23:29,350 --> 01:23:29,360
people to have a very strong
 

4937
01:23:29,360 --> 01:23:31,830
people to have a very strong
understanding of libertarian ideas to

4938
01:23:31,830 --> 01:23:31,840
understanding of libertarian ideas to
 

4939
01:23:31,840 --> 01:23:33,350
understanding of libertarian ideas to
have a load time preference to have a

4940
01:23:33,350 --> 01:23:33,360
have a load time preference to have a
 

4941
01:23:33,360 --> 01:23:35,510
have a load time preference to have a
preference for the future

4942
01:23:35,510 --> 01:23:35,520
preference for the future
 

4943
01:23:35,520 --> 01:23:37,350
preference for the future
so you need a majority of the population

4944
01:23:37,350 --> 01:23:37,360
so you need a majority of the population
 

4945
01:23:37,360 --> 01:23:40,390
so you need a majority of the population
to not decide to go and do something

4946
01:23:40,390 --> 01:23:40,400
to not decide to go and do something
 

4947
01:23:40,400 --> 01:23:42,950
to not decide to go and do something
insane in order to continue to have a

4948
01:23:42,950 --> 01:23:42,960
insane in order to continue to have a
 

4949
01:23:42,960 --> 01:23:45,270
insane in order to continue to have a
free society you know

4950
01:23:45,270 --> 01:23:45,280
free society you know
 

4951
01:23:45,280 --> 01:23:48,750
free society you know
when a respiratory illness comes along

4952
01:23:48,750 --> 01:23:48,760
when a respiratory illness comes along
 

4953
01:23:48,760 --> 01:23:50,709
when a respiratory illness comes along
unfortunately you know the last couple

4954
01:23:50,709 --> 01:23:50,719
unfortunately you know the last couple
 

4955
01:23:50,719 --> 01:23:52,229
unfortunately you know the last couple
of years showed that we

4956
01:23:52,229 --> 01:23:52,239
of years showed that we
 

4957
01:23:52,239 --> 01:23:55,110
of years showed that we
the vast majority of people are

4958
01:23:55,110 --> 01:23:55,120

i think uh there might be a case that
 

4985
01:24:21,600 --> 01:24:23,430
i think uh there might be a case that
so as i was saying you need the majority

4986

so as i was saying you need the majority
 

4987
01:24:23,440 --> 01:24:25,270
so as i was saying you need the majority
of the population to get together and

4988
01:24:25,270 --> 01:24:25,280
of the population to get together and
 

4989
01:24:25,280 --> 01:24:27,189
of the population to get together and
decide nope

01:24:27,189 --> 01:24:27,199
decide nope
 

4991
01:24:27,199 --> 01:24:29,189
decide nope
whatever is the case you know the answer

4992
01:24:29,189 --> 01:24:29,199
whatever is the case you know the answer
 

4993
01:24:29,199 --> 01:24:31,990
whatever is the case you know the answer
is voluntary

4994
01:24:31,990 --> 01:24:32,000
is voluntary
 

4995
01:24:32,000 --> 01:24:34,149
is voluntary

others to do that so you need a majority

5006
01:24:43,270 --> 01:24:43,280
others to do that so you need a majority
 

5007
01:24:43,280 --> 01:24:44,390
others to do that so you need a majority
of the people to

5008
01:24:44,390 --> 01:24:44,400
of the people to
 

5009
01:24:44,400 --> 01:24:46,390
of the people to
uh strongly believe in this principle in

5010
01:24:46,390 --> 01:24:46,400
uh strongly believe in this principle in
 

5011
01:24:46,400 --> 01:24:50,229
uh strongly believe in this principle in
order to get it in a um in a democracy

5012
01:24:50,229 --> 01:24:50,239
order to get it in a um in a democracy
 

5013
01:24:50,239 --> 01:24:52,310
order to get it in a um in a democracy
whereas in a monarchy

5014
01:24:52,310 --> 01:24:52,320
whereas in a monarchy
 

5015
01:24:52,320 --> 01:24:54,470
whereas in a monarchy
really just need the king to get it and

5016
01:24:54,470 --> 01:24:54,480
really just need the king to get it and
 

5017
01:24:54,480 --> 01:24:56,709
really just need the king to get it and
i think the reason kings are more likely

5018
01:24:56,709 --> 01:24:56,719
i think the reason kings are more likely
 

5019
01:24:56,719 --> 01:24:59,430
i think the reason kings are more likely
to get it is that kings have a low time

5020
01:24:59,430 --> 01:24:59,440
to get it is that kings have a low time
 

5021
01:24:59,440 --> 01:25:01,350
to get it is that kings have a low time

preference where they think about things
 

5023
01:25:01,360 --> 01:25:02,149
preference where they think about things
for

5024
01:25:02,149 --> 01:25:02,159
for
 

5025
01:25:02,159 --> 01:25:03,910
for
many generations whereas in the

5026
01:25:03,910 --> 01:25:03,920
many generations whereas in the
 

5027
01:25:03,920 --> 01:25:06,790
many generations whereas in the
democratic system your president is

5028
01:25:06,790 --> 01:25:06,800
democratic system your president is
 

5029
01:25:06,800 --> 01:25:08,790
democratic system your president is
likely only going to be there for four

5030
01:25:08,790 --> 01:25:08,800
likely only going to be there for four
 

5031
01:25:08,800 --> 01:25:10,950
likely only going to be there for four
years or eight years or 10 years or five

5032
01:25:10,950 --> 01:25:10,960
years or eight years or 10 years or five
 

5033
01:25:10,960 --> 01:25:12,470
years or eight years or 10 years or five
years or whatever it is

5034
01:25:12,470 --> 01:25:12,480
years or whatever it is
 

5035
01:25:12,480 --> 01:25:14,550
years or whatever it is
so the the only way that you know all

5036
01:25:14,550 --> 01:25:14,560
so the the only way that you know all
 

5037
01:25:14,560 --> 01:25:16,229
so the the only way that you know all
humans are self-interested so the only

5038
01:25:16,229 --> 01:25:16,239
humans are self-interested so the only
 

5039
01:25:16,239 --> 01:25:17,830
humans are self-interested so the only
way that your president in a democracy

5040
01:25:17,830 --> 01:25:17,840
way that your president in a democracy
 

5041
01:25:17,840 --> 01:25:19,750
way that your president in a democracy
can provide for themselves

5042
01:25:19,750 --> 01:25:19,760
can provide for themselves
 

5043
01:25:19,760 --> 01:25:21,590
can provide for themselves
is to maximize the amount of

5044
01:25:21,590 --> 01:25:21,600
is to maximize the amount of
 

5045
01:25:21,600 --> 01:25:23,430
is to maximize the amount of
exploitation that they can do of the

5046
01:25:23,430 --> 01:25:23,440
exploitation that they can do of the
 

5047
01:25:23,440 --> 01:25:26,470
exploitation that they can do of the
population during their brief stint and

5048
01:25:26,470 --> 01:25:26,480
population during their brief stint and
 

5049
01:25:26,480 --> 01:25:28,629
population during their brief stint and
then when he's out you get a new one and

5050
01:25:28,629 --> 01:25:28,639
then when he's out you get a new one and
 

5051
01:25:28,639 --> 01:25:30,070
then when he's out you get a new one and
then that one wants to start all over

5052
01:25:30,070 --> 01:25:30,080
then that one wants to start all over
 

5053
01:25:30,080 --> 01:25:31,910
then that one wants to start all over
again so every four years you get a new

5054
01:25:31,910 --> 01:25:31,920
again so every four years you get a new
 

5055
01:25:31,920 --> 01:25:34,390
again so every four years you get a new
robber with monarchy

5056
01:25:34,390 --> 01:25:34,400
robber with monarchy
 

5057
01:25:34,400 --> 01:25:35,189
robber with monarchy

to ever happen but i think you know if
you look historically the the the the

and
 

5387
01:31:28,080 --> 01:31:30,550
and
thinking that most

5388
01:31:30,550 --> 01:31:30,560
thinking that most
 

5389
01:31:30,560 --> 01:31:33,430
thinking that most
of those wars were unjust unethical and

01:31:36,960 --> 01:31:38,870

how else do you find how would you

5394
01:31:38,870 --> 01:31:38,880
how else do you find how would you
 

5395
01:31:38,880 --> 01:31:41,910
how else do you find how would you
finance a war so ideally you don't no

5396

um that's how it was under the gold
standard mostly because under the gold

5422
01:32:08,229 --> 01:32:08,239
standard mostly because under the gold
 

5423
01:32:08,239 --> 01:32:10,229
standard mostly because under the gold
standard the government couldn't print

5424
01:32:10,229 --> 01:32:10,239
standard the government couldn't print
 

5425
01:32:10,239 --> 01:32:12,229
standard the government couldn't print
gold and so they had a budget they had a

5426
01:32:12,229 --> 01:32:12,239
gold and so they had a budget they had a
 

5427
01:32:12,239 --> 01:32:14,070
gold and so they had a budget they had a
certain amount of gold and that wasn't

certain amount of gold and that wasn't
 

5429
01:32:14,080 --> 01:32:16,070
certain amount of gold and that wasn't
just you know they couldn't infinitely

5430
01:32:16,070 --> 01:32:16,080
just you know they couldn't infinitely
 

5431
01:32:16,080 --> 01:32:17,830
just you know they couldn't infinitely
increase it so they couldn't tax their

5432
01:32:17,830 --> 01:32:17,840
increase it so they couldn't tax their
 

5433
01:32:17,840 --> 01:32:21,030
increase it so they couldn't tax their
population um at will and it's very

5434
01:32:21,030 --> 01:32:21,040
population um at will and it's very
 

5435
01:32:21,040 --> 01:32:22,870
population um at will and it's very

5529
01:34:00,719 --> 01:34:03,910
going to back down we're going to fight
germany and perhaps that step alone is

5530
01:34:03,910 --> 01:34:03,920
germany and perhaps that step alone is
 

5531
01:34:03,920 --> 01:34:06,550
germany and perhaps that step alone is
one of the biggest reasons that hitler

one of the biggest reasons that hitler
 

5533
01:34:06,560 --> 01:34:07,669
one of the biggest reasons that hitler

01:38:09,040 --> 01:38:11,830
agree entirely
but fiat money yeah so how fiat money

5756
01:38:11,830 --> 01:38:11,840
but fiat money yeah so how fiat money
 

5757
01:38:11,840 --> 01:38:13,990
but fiat money yeah so how fiat money
was born yeah let's get back to that so

5758
01:38:13,990 --> 01:38:14,000
was born yeah let's get back to that so
 

5759
01:38:14,000 --> 01:38:16,629
was born yeah let's get back to that so
they finance the war with that money so

5760
01:38:16,629 --> 01:38:16,639
they finance the war with that money so
 

5761
01:38:16,639 --> 01:38:18,149
they finance the war with that money so
what is what could go wrong that's where

5762
01:38:18,149 --> 01:38:18,159
what is what could go wrong that's where
 

5763
01:38:18,159 --> 01:38:20,149
what is what could go wrong that's where
we left off well what could go wrong

5764
01:38:20,149 --> 01:38:20,159
we left off well what could go wrong
 

5765
01:38:20,159 --> 01:38:22,310
we left off well what could go wrong
when you've just printed an

5766
01:38:22,310 --> 01:38:22,320
when you've just printed an
 

5767
01:38:22,320 --> 01:38:24,629
when you've just printed an
enormous amount of credit and use it to

5768
01:38:24,629 --> 01:38:24,639
enormous amount of credit and use it to
 

5769
01:38:24,639 --> 01:38:25,590
enormous amount of credit and use it to
buy

5770
01:38:25,590 --> 01:38:25,600
buy
 

5771
01:38:25,600 --> 01:38:26,629
buy
bonds

5772
01:38:26,629 --> 01:38:26,639
bonds
 

5773
01:38:26,639 --> 01:38:28,070
bonds
what goes wrong is that the value of the

5774
01:38:28,070 --> 01:38:28,080
what goes wrong is that the value of the
 

5775
01:38:28,080 --> 01:38:30,149
what goes wrong is that the value of the
currency is going to go down or in other

5776
01:38:30,149 --> 01:38:30,159
currency is going to go down or in other
 

5777
01:38:30,159 --> 01:38:32,070
currency is going to go down or in other
words prices of things are going to go

5778
01:38:32,070 --> 01:38:32,080
words prices of things are going to go
 

5779
01:38:32,080 --> 01:38:34,550
words prices of things are going to go
up so during the war prices keep going

5780
01:38:34,550 --> 01:38:34,560
up so during the war prices keep going
 

5781
01:38:34,560 --> 01:38:36,070
up so during the war prices keep going
up and

5782
01:38:36,070 --> 01:38:36,080
up and
 

5783
01:38:36,080 --> 01:38:37,910
up and
this is of course

5784
01:38:37,910 --> 01:38:37,920
this is of course
 

5785
01:38:37,920 --> 01:38:39,270
this is of course
is going to sound very familiar to

5786
01:38:39,270 --> 01:38:39,280
is going to sound very familiar to
 

5787
01:38:39,280 --> 01:38:41,350
is going to sound very familiar to
victims of the 20th century

5788
01:38:41,350 --> 01:38:41,360
victims of the 20th century
 

5789
01:38:41,360 --> 01:38:42,790
victims of the 20th century
a government tells you it's because of

5790
01:38:42,790 --> 01:38:42,800
a government tells you it's because of
 

5791
01:38:42,800 --> 01:38:44,550
a government tells you it's because of
the war it's not our fault it's because

5792
01:38:44,550 --> 01:38:44,560
the war it's not our fault it's because
 

5793
01:38:44,560 --> 01:38:45,669
the war it's not our fault it's because
of the germans it's because of the

5794
01:38:45,669 --> 01:38:45,679
of the germans it's because of the
 

5795
01:38:45,679 --> 01:38:47,189
of the germans it's because of the
foreigners it's because of putin it's

5796
01:38:47,189 --> 01:38:47,199
foreigners it's because of putin it's
 

5797
01:38:47,199 --> 01:38:48,950
foreigners it's because of putin it's
because of this it's because of that

5798
01:38:48,950 --> 01:38:48,960
because of this it's because of that
 

5799
01:38:48,960 --> 01:38:50,629
because of this it's because of that
this has always been the case there's

5800
01:38:50,629 --> 01:38:50,639
this has always been the case there's
 

5801
01:38:50,639 --> 01:38:52,390
this has always been the case there's
always um

5802
01:38:52,390 --> 01:38:52,400
always um
 

5803
01:38:52,400 --> 01:38:55,030
always um
war is a very good cover for inflation

5804
01:38:55,030 --> 01:38:55,040
war is a very good cover for inflation
 

5805
01:38:55,040 --> 01:38:57,750
war is a very good cover for inflation
which is caused by monetary phenomena

5806
01:38:57,750 --> 01:38:57,760
which is caused by monetary phenomena
 

5807
01:38:57,760 --> 01:38:59,590
which is caused by monetary phenomena
so then the war ends

5808
01:38:59,590 --> 01:38:59,600
so then the war ends
 

5809
01:38:59,600 --> 01:39:02,070
so then the war ends
and inflation uh prices have more than

5810
01:39:02,070 --> 01:39:02,080
and inflation uh prices have more than
 

5811
01:39:02,080 --> 01:39:04,870
and inflation uh prices have more than
doubled over the past four years over

5812
01:39:04,870 --> 01:39:04,880
doubled over the past four years over
 

5813
01:39:04,880 --> 01:39:07,590
doubled over the past four years over
the four years of uh world war one

5814
01:39:07,590 --> 01:39:07,600
the four years of uh world war one
 

5815
01:39:07,600 --> 01:39:09,270
the four years of uh world war one
prices more than doubled

5816
01:39:09,270 --> 01:39:09,280
prices more than doubled
 

5817
01:39:09,280 --> 01:39:12,390
prices more than doubled
and then the british economy is in bad

5818
01:39:12,390 --> 01:39:12,400
and then the british economy is in bad
 

5819
01:39:12,400 --> 01:39:14,390
and then the british economy is in bad
trouble obviously you know it's

5820
01:39:14,390 --> 01:39:14,400
trouble obviously you know it's
 

5821
01:39:14,400 --> 01:39:15,990
trouble obviously you know it's
lost a lot of the labor force for four

5822
01:39:15,990 --> 01:39:16,000
lost a lot of the labor force for four
 

5823
01:39:16,000 --> 01:39:18,390
lost a lot of the labor force for four
years that was out there fighting now

5824
01:39:18,390 --> 01:39:18,400
years that was out there fighting now
 

5825
01:39:18,400 --> 01:39:20,550
years that was out there fighting now
those workers come back

5826
01:39:20,550 --> 01:39:20,560
those workers come back
 

5827
01:39:20,560 --> 01:39:23,430
those workers come back
you've got uh prices are up and so

5828
01:39:23,430 --> 01:39:23,440
you've got uh prices are up and so
 

5829
01:39:23,440 --> 01:39:25,830
you've got uh prices are up and so
people are requiring that are demanding

5830
01:39:25,830 --> 01:39:25,840
people are requiring that are demanding
 

5831
01:39:25,840 --> 01:39:27,189
people are requiring that are demanding
that the government control prices and

5832
01:39:27,189 --> 01:39:27,199
that the government control prices and
 

5833
01:39:27,199 --> 01:39:29,030
that the government control prices and
the government is trying to fix the

5834
01:39:29,030 --> 01:39:29,040
the government is trying to fix the
 

5835
01:39:29,040 --> 01:39:30,550
the government is trying to fix the
problem of inflation by doing price

5836
01:39:30,550 --> 01:39:30,560
problem of inflation by doing price
 

5837
01:39:30,560 --> 01:39:32,709
problem of inflation by doing price
controls which is what they always do

5838
01:39:32,709 --> 01:39:32,719
controls which is what they always do
 

5839
01:39:32,719 --> 01:39:35,350
controls which is what they always do
which is catastrophic because it makes

5840
01:39:35,350 --> 01:39:35,360
which is catastrophic because it makes
 

5841
01:39:35,360 --> 01:39:36,950
which is catastrophic because it makes
things worse when you

5842
01:39:36,950 --> 01:39:36,960
things worse when you
 

5843
01:39:36,960 --> 01:39:39,430
things worse when you
implement price controls you when you

5844
01:39:39,430 --> 01:39:39,440
implement price controls you when you
 

5845
01:39:39,440 --> 01:39:41,109
implement price controls you when you
make you know you say all right well

5846
01:39:41,109 --> 01:39:41,119
make you know you say all right well
 

5847
01:39:41,119 --> 01:39:44,550
make you know you say all right well
bread can't be sold for more than x uh

5848
01:39:44,550 --> 01:39:44,560
bread can't be sold for more than x uh
 

5849
01:39:44,560 --> 01:39:47,270
bread can't be sold for more than x uh
price well that's just preventing

5850
01:39:47,270 --> 01:39:47,280
price well that's just preventing
 

5851
01:39:47,280 --> 01:39:49,109
price well that's just preventing
bread producers from producing a lot of

5852
01:39:49,109 --> 01:39:49,119
bread producers from producing a lot of
 

5853
01:39:49,119 --> 01:39:51,109
bread producers from producing a lot of
bread and that's just making the problem

5854
01:39:51,109 --> 01:39:51,119
bread and that's just making the problem
 

5855
01:39:51,119 --> 01:39:53,350
bread and that's just making the problem
worse if you let the price rise the

5856
01:39:53,350 --> 01:39:53,360
worse if you let the price rise the
 

5857
01:39:53,360 --> 01:39:55,030
worse if you let the price rise the
extra price

5858
01:39:55,030 --> 01:39:55,040
extra price
 

5859
01:39:55,040 --> 01:39:56,709
extra price
first of all it makes people economized

5860
01:39:56,709 --> 01:39:56,719
first of all it makes people economized
 

5861
01:39:56,719 --> 01:39:58,629
first of all it makes people economized
so people will only buy what they need

5862
01:39:58,629 --> 01:39:58,639
so people will only buy what they need
 

5863
01:39:58,639 --> 01:40:00,229
so people will only buy what they need
and it provides the money for the bread

5864
01:40:00,229 --> 01:40:00,239
and it provides the money for the bread
 

5865
01:40:00,239 --> 01:40:02,629
and it provides the money for the bread
producers to acquire the capital and the

5866
01:40:02,629 --> 01:40:02,639
producers to acquire the capital and the
 

5867
01:40:02,639 --> 01:40:04,149
producers to acquire the capital and the
resources they need to produce more

5868
01:40:04,149 --> 01:40:04,159
resources they need to produce more
 

5869
01:40:04,159 --> 01:40:05,830
resources they need to produce more
bread which then brings the price of

5870
01:40:05,830 --> 01:40:05,840
bread which then brings the price of
 

5871
01:40:05,840 --> 01:40:07,590
bread which then brings the price of
bread down but price controls destroy

5872
01:40:07,590 --> 01:40:07,600
bread down but price controls destroy
 

5873
01:40:07,600 --> 01:40:08,390
bread down but price controls destroy
that

5874
01:40:08,390 --> 01:40:08,400
that
 

5875
01:40:08,400 --> 01:40:10,070
that
and then they also implement wage

5876
01:40:10,070 --> 01:40:10,080
and then they also implement wage
 

5877
01:40:10,080 --> 01:40:11,510
and then they also implement wage
controls so

5878
01:40:11,510 --> 01:40:11,520
controls so
 

5879
01:40:11,520 --> 01:40:13,590
controls so
you want to also make sure that people

5880
01:40:13,590 --> 01:40:13,600
you want to also make sure that people
 

5881
01:40:13,600 --> 01:40:16,070
you want to also make sure that people
have high wages so you raise people's

5882
01:40:16,070 --> 01:40:16,080
have high wages so you raise people's
 

5883
01:40:16,080 --> 01:40:17,910
have high wages so you raise people's
wages artificially you lower prices

5884
01:40:17,910 --> 01:40:17,920
wages artificially you lower prices
 

5885
01:40:17,920 --> 01:40:20,070
wages artificially you lower prices
artificially and you cause an economic

5886
01:40:20,070 --> 01:40:20,080
artificially and you cause an economic
 

5887
01:40:20,080 --> 01:40:21,189
artificially and you cause an economic
problem

5888
01:40:21,189 --> 01:40:21,199
problem
 

5889
01:40:21,199 --> 01:40:23,510
problem
and this this is basically you know i i

5890
01:40:23,510 --> 01:40:23,520
and this this is basically you know i i
 

5891
01:40:23,520 --> 01:40:25,270
and this this is basically you know i i
use this historical example because it's

5892
01:40:25,270 --> 01:40:25,280
use this historical example because it's
 

5893
01:40:25,280 --> 01:40:27,350
use this historical example because it's
the birth of fiat because the bank of

5894
01:40:27,350 --> 01:40:27,360
the birth of fiat because the bank of
 

5895
01:40:27,360 --> 01:40:29,030
the birth of fiat because the bank of
england was the most important monetary

5896
01:40:29,030 --> 01:40:29,040
england was the most important monetary
 

5897
01:40:29,040 --> 01:40:31,510
england was the most important monetary
system in the world at that time

5898
01:40:31,510 --> 01:40:31,520
system in the world at that time
 

5899
01:40:31,520 --> 01:40:33,590
system in the world at that time
and because it's the prototype that

5900
01:40:33,590 --> 01:40:33,600
and because it's the prototype that
 

5901
01:40:33,600 --> 01:40:35,189
and because it's the prototype that
basically the entire planet copied over

5902
01:40:35,189 --> 01:40:35,199
basically the entire planet copied over
 

5903
01:40:35,199 --> 01:40:37,030
basically the entire planet copied over
the last hundred years we've had this

5904
01:40:37,030 --> 01:40:37,040
the last hundred years we've had this
 

5905
01:40:37,040 --> 01:40:38,709
the last hundred years we've had this
same thing happen the government prints

5906
01:40:38,709 --> 01:40:38,719
same thing happen the government prints
 

5907
01:40:38,719 --> 01:40:40,470
same thing happen the government prints
money because of a stupid reason because

5908
01:40:40,470 --> 01:40:40,480
money because of a stupid reason because
 

5909
01:40:40,480 --> 01:40:43,109
money because of a stupid reason because
somebody in power decided this was worth

5910
01:40:43,109 --> 01:40:43,119
somebody in power decided this was worth
 

5911
01:40:43,119 --> 01:40:44,870
somebody in power decided this was worth
destroying everybody's livelihood and

5912
01:40:44,870 --> 01:40:44,880
destroying everybody's livelihood and
 

5913
01:40:44,880 --> 01:40:46,070
destroying everybody's livelihood and

01:43:21,920 --> 01:43:24,629
made the pound a specific amount of gold
and since then up until world war one it

6072
01:43:24,629 --> 01:43:24,639
and since then up until world war one it
 

6073
01:43:24,639 --> 01:43:25,669
and since then up until world war one it
was uh

6074
01:43:25,669 --> 01:43:25,679
was uh
 

6075
01:43:25,679 --> 01:43:29,030
was uh
4.25 pounds per ounce of gold i think i

6076
01:43:29,030 --> 01:43:29,040
4.25 pounds per ounce of gold i think i
 

6077
01:43:29,040 --> 01:43:30,950
4.25 pounds per ounce of gold i think i
might be wrong but i have it in the in

6078
01:43:30,950 --> 01:43:30,960
might be wrong but i have it in the in
 

6079
01:43:30,960 --> 01:43:32,709
might be wrong but i have it in the in
the book so he'd set that price and it

6080
01:43:32,709 --> 01:43:32,719
the book so he'd set that price and it
 

6081
01:43:32,719 --> 01:43:34,149
the book so he'd set that price and it
was a matter of national pride for

6082
01:43:34,149 --> 01:43:34,159
was a matter of national pride for
 

6083
01:43:34,159 --> 01:43:35,750
was a matter of national pride for
people in england you know

6084
01:43:35,750 --> 01:43:35,760
people in england you know
 

6085
01:43:35,760 --> 01:43:37,590
people in england you know
the sterling is as good as gold because

6086
01:43:37,590 --> 01:43:37,600
the sterling is as good as gold because
 

6087
01:43:37,600 --> 01:43:39,830
the sterling is as good as gold because
for two centuries it has been stuck to

6088
01:43:39,830 --> 01:43:39,840
for two centuries it has been stuck to
 

6089
01:43:39,840 --> 01:43:40,950
for two centuries it has been stuck to
gold there was the exception of the

6090
01:43:40,950 --> 01:43:40,960
gold there was the exception of the
 

6091
01:43:40,960 --> 01:43:43,510
gold there was the exception of the
napoleonic wars but for two centuries

6092
01:43:43,510 --> 01:43:43,520
napoleonic wars but for two centuries
 

6093
01:43:43,520 --> 01:43:45,990
napoleonic wars but for two centuries
mostly it was stuck to that and so they

6094
01:43:45,990 --> 01:43:46,000
mostly it was stuck to that and so they
 

6095
01:43:46,000 --> 01:43:47,350
mostly it was stuck to that and so they
went off that

6096
01:43:47,350 --> 01:43:47,360
went off that
 

6097
01:43:47,360 --> 01:43:49,189
went off that
and then they couldn't go back because

6098
01:43:49,189 --> 01:43:49,199
and then they couldn't go back because
 

6099
01:43:49,199 --> 01:43:50,550
and then they couldn't go back because
they wanted to go back they didn't have

6100
01:43:50,550 --> 01:43:50,560
they wanted to go back they didn't have
 

6101
01:43:50,560 --> 01:43:51,910
they wanted to go back they didn't have
enough gold they shipped their gold to

6102
01:43:51,910 --> 01:43:51,920
enough gold they shipped their gold to
 

6103
01:43:51,920 --> 01:43:54,470
enough gold they shipped their gold to
the us to finance the war

6104
01:43:54,470 --> 01:43:54,480
the us to finance the war
 

6105
01:43:54,480 --> 01:43:55,990
the us to finance the war
and they had printed a whole bunch of

6106
01:43:55,990 --> 01:43:56,000
and they had printed a whole bunch of
 

6107
01:43:56,000 --> 01:43:58,870
and they had printed a whole bunch of
money that was out there so this begins

6108
01:43:58,870 --> 01:43:58,880
money that was out there so this begins
 

6109
01:43:58,880 --> 01:43:59,990
money that was out there so this begins
the problem

6110
01:43:59,990 --> 01:44:00,000
the problem
 

6111
01:44:00,000 --> 01:44:02,629
the problem
for england and that begins the end of

6112
01:44:02,629 --> 01:44:02,639
for england and that begins the end of
 

6113
01:44:02,639 --> 01:44:04,950
for england and that begins the end of
england as the world's superpower

6114
01:44:04,950 --> 01:44:04,960
england as the world's superpower
 

6115
01:44:04,960 --> 01:44:06,550
england as the world's superpower
and the way they tried to fight that was

6116
01:44:06,550 --> 01:44:06,560
and the way they tried to fight that was
 

6117
01:44:06,560 --> 01:44:08,070
and the way they tried to fight that was
to get more and more countries around

6118
01:44:08,070 --> 01:44:08,080
to get more and more countries around
 

6119
01:44:08,080 --> 01:44:09,990
to get more and more countries around
the world to establish central banks and

6120
01:44:09,990 --> 01:44:10,000
the world to establish central banks and
 

6121
01:44:10,000 --> 01:44:12,470
the world to establish central banks and
have unhold british pounds so they'd

6122
01:44:12,470 --> 01:44:12,480
have unhold british pounds so they'd
 

6123
01:44:12,480 --> 01:44:14,470
have unhold british pounds so they'd
hold you know basically dumping their

6124
01:44:14,470 --> 01:44:14,480
hold you know basically dumping their
 

6125
01:44:14,480 --> 01:44:17,750
hold you know basically dumping their
bags uh like uh just any other coin

6126
01:44:17,750 --> 01:44:17,760
bags uh like uh just any other coin
 

6127
01:44:17,760 --> 01:44:19,270
bags uh like uh just any other coin
you just if you get people to buy your

6128
01:44:19,270 --> 01:44:19,280
you just if you get people to buy your
 

6129
01:44:19,280 --> 01:44:20,950
you just if you get people to buy your
 coin you know that raises the value

6130
01:44:20,950 --> 01:44:20,960
coin you know that raises the value
 

6131
01:44:20,960 --> 01:44:23,030
coin you know that raises the value
of your coin so can you define

6132
01:44:23,030 --> 01:44:23,040
of your coin so can you define
 

6133
01:44:23,040 --> 01:44:23,830
of your coin so can you define
coin

6134
01:44:23,830 --> 01:44:23,840
coin
 

6135
01:44:23,840 --> 01:44:26,550
coin
 coin is it's in my my definition of

coin is that it's any form of money
where uh somebody can produce it so soft

6140
01:44:31,750 --> 01:44:31,760
where uh somebody can produce it so soft
 

6141
01:44:31,760 --> 01:44:32,790
where uh somebody can produce it so soft
money

6142
01:44:32,790 --> 01:44:32,800
money
 

6143
01:44:32,800 --> 01:44:34,629
money
um not necessarily

6144
01:44:34,629 --> 01:44:34,639
um not necessarily
 

6145
01:44:34,639 --> 01:44:36,229
um not necessarily
i guess i think the difference so

6146
01:44:36,229 --> 01:44:36,239
i guess i think the difference so
 

6147
01:44:36,239 --> 01:44:38,790
i guess i think the difference so
there's easy money um but

6148
01:44:38,790 --> 01:44:38,800
there's easy money um but
 

6149
01:44:38,800 --> 01:44:39,910
there's easy money um but
the

6150
01:44:39,910 --> 01:44:39,920
the
 

6151
01:44:39,920 --> 01:44:41,590
the
 coin is something that someone can

6152
01:44:41,590 --> 01:44:41,600
coin is something that someone can
 

6153
01:44:41,600 --> 01:44:44,149
coin is something that someone can
produce at the rate that is diff at

6154
01:44:44,149 --> 01:44:44,159
produce at the rate that is diff at
 

6155
01:44:44,159 --> 01:44:45,669
produce at the rate that is diff at
a cost that is different from the market

6156
01:44:45,669 --> 01:44:45,679
a cost that is different from the market
 

6157
01:44:45,679 --> 01:44:48,550
a cost that is different from the market
cost so gold nobody can make gold except

6158
01:44:48,550 --> 01:44:48,560
cost so gold nobody can make gold except
 

6159
01:44:48,560 --> 01:44:50,390
cost so gold nobody can make gold except
that they dig for it and the cost of

6160
01:44:50,390 --> 01:44:50,400
that they dig for it and the cost of
 

6161
01:44:50,400 --> 01:44:52,550
that they dig for it and the cost of
mining gold is generally in the range of

6162
01:44:52,550 --> 01:44:52,560
mining gold is generally in the range of
 

6163
01:44:52,560 --> 01:44:54,470
mining gold is generally in the range of
the price of gold

6164
01:44:54,470 --> 01:44:54,480
the price of gold
 

6165
01:44:54,480 --> 01:44:56,790
the price of gold
seems true for bitcoin um but gold is

6166
01:44:56,790 --> 01:44:56,800
seems true for bitcoin um but gold is
 

6167
01:44:56,800 --> 01:44:59,270
seems true for bitcoin um but gold is
not a coin gold is not a coin

6168
01:44:59,270 --> 01:44:59,280
not a coin gold is not a coin
 

6169
01:44:59,280 --> 01:45:00,629
not a coin gold is not a coin
the copper is

6170
01:45:00,629 --> 01:45:00,639
the copper is
 

6171
01:45:00,639 --> 01:45:01,750
the copper is
cop

6172
01:45:01,750 --> 01:45:01,760
cop
 

6173
01:45:01,760 --> 01:45:03,669
cop
i i'm not so sure i wouldn't call copper

6174
01:45:03,669 --> 01:45:03,679
i i'm not so sure i wouldn't call copper
 

6175
01:45:03,679 --> 01:45:05,669
i i'm not so sure i wouldn't call copper
or coin as much as it is easy money

6176
01:45:05,669 --> 01:45:05,679
or coin as much as it is easy money
 

6177
01:45:05,679 --> 01:45:08,550
or coin as much as it is easy money
but i think um government currencies and

6178
01:45:08,550 --> 01:45:08,560
but i think um government currencies and
 

6179
01:45:08,560 --> 01:45:10,629
but i think um government currencies and
other alt coins i think are coins

6180
01:45:10,629 --> 01:45:10,639
other alt coins i think are coins
 

6181
01:45:10,639 --> 01:45:11,669
other alt coins i think are coins
because

6182
01:45:11,669 --> 01:45:11,679
because
 

6183
01:45:11,679 --> 01:45:13,590
because
somebody could click a button and make

6184
01:45:13,590 --> 01:45:13,600
somebody could click a button and make
 

6185
01:45:13,600 --> 01:45:15,750
somebody could click a button and make
10 times the supply would it be fair to

6186
01:45:15,750 --> 01:45:15,760
10 times the supply would it be fair to
 

6187
01:45:15,760 --> 01:45:19,030
10 times the supply would it be fair to
say that this began

6188
01:45:19,030 --> 01:45:19,040
say that this began
 

6189
01:45:19,040 --> 01:45:20,229
say that this began
with the

6190
01:45:20,229 --> 01:45:20,239
with the
 

6191
01:45:20,239 --> 01:45:23,109
with the
will for war in world war one

6192
01:45:23,109 --> 01:45:23,119
will for war in world war one
 

6193
01:45:23,119 --> 01:45:24,470
will for war in world war one
so

6194
01:45:24,470 --> 01:45:24,480
so
 

6195
01:45:24,480 --> 01:45:26,709
so
the

6196
01:45:26,709 --> 01:45:26,719
the
 

6197
01:45:26,719 --> 01:45:30,149
the
the march towards fiat began

6198
01:45:30,149 --> 01:45:30,159
the march towards fiat began
 

6199
01:45:30,159 --> 01:45:34,229
the march towards fiat began
with a global desire for war

6200
01:45:34,229 --> 01:45:34,239
with a global desire for war
 

6201
01:45:34,239 --> 01:45:37,350
with a global desire for war
in the 20th century did war start this

6202
01:45:37,350 --> 01:45:37,360
in the 20th century did war start this
 

6203
01:45:37,360 --> 01:45:39,510
in the 20th century did war start this
or was war result

6204
01:45:39,510 --> 01:45:39,520
or was war result
 

6205
01:45:39,520 --> 01:45:41,189
or was war result
it's difficult to say really i think it

6206
01:45:41,189 --> 01:45:41,199
it's difficult to say really i think it
 

6207
01:45:41,199 --> 01:45:45,669
it's difficult to say really i think it
goes both ways i think um you can't have

6208
01:45:45,669 --> 01:45:45,679
goes both ways i think um you can't have
 

6209
01:45:45,679 --> 01:45:48,310
goes both ways i think um you can't have
permanent war without fiat

6210
01:45:48,310 --> 01:45:48,320
permanent war without fiat
 

6211
01:45:48,320 --> 01:45:50,709
permanent war without fiat
and i also think

6212
01:45:50,709 --> 01:45:50,719
and i also think
 

6213
01:45:50,719 --> 01:45:51,990
and i also think
there's a case to be made that you can't

6214
01:45:51,990 --> 01:45:52,000
there's a case to be made that you can't
 

6215
01:45:52,000 --> 01:45:55,030
there's a case to be made that you can't
really have fiat without war it's so

6216
01:45:55,030 --> 01:45:55,040
really have fiat without war it's so
 

6217
01:45:55,040 --> 01:45:57,270
really have fiat without war it's so
it's some kind of weird dynamical system

6218
01:45:57,270 --> 01:45:57,280
it's some kind of weird dynamical system
 

6219
01:45:57,280 --> 01:45:59,350
it's some kind of weird dynamical system
with a chicken and egg situation and

6220
01:45:59,350 --> 01:45:59,360
with a chicken and egg situation and
 

6221
01:45:59,360 --> 01:46:00,709
with a chicken and egg situation and
they build on top of each other and

6222
01:46:00,709 --> 01:46:00,719
they build on top of each other and
 

6223
01:46:00,719 --> 01:46:02,709
they build on top of each other and
there's a few individuals that figured

6224
01:46:02,709 --> 01:46:02,719
there's a few individuals that figured
 

6225
01:46:02,719 --> 01:46:04,390
there's a few individuals that figured
out there's a way to manipulate this to

6226
01:46:04,390 --> 01:46:04,400
out there's a way to manipulate this to
 

6227
01:46:04,400 --> 01:46:07,430
out there's a way to manipulate this to
play this kind of game and it escalates

6228
01:46:07,430 --> 01:46:07,440
play this kind of game and it escalates
 

6229
01:46:07,440 --> 01:46:08,790
play this kind of game and it escalates
and nothing gives you the ability to

6230
01:46:08,790 --> 01:46:08,800
and nothing gives you the ability to
 

6231
01:46:08,800 --> 01:46:11,109
and nothing gives you the ability to
manipulate money

6232
01:46:11,109 --> 01:46:11,119
manipulate money
 

6233
01:46:11,119 --> 01:46:13,750
manipulate money
quite like war when you have a war

6234
01:46:13,750 --> 01:46:13,760
quite like war when you have a war
 

6235
01:46:13,760 --> 01:46:16,310
quite like war when you have a war
you can declare an emergency you can

6236
01:46:16,310 --> 01:46:16,320
you can declare an emergency you can
 

6237
01:46:16,320 --> 01:46:18,550
you can declare an emergency you can
call all the people who oppose you

6238
01:46:18,550 --> 01:46:18,560
call all the people who oppose you
 

6239
01:46:18,560 --> 01:46:21,189
call all the people who oppose you
traitors you can uh

6240
01:46:21,189 --> 01:46:21,199
traitors you can uh
 

6241
01:46:21,199 --> 01:46:23,430
traitors you can uh
you can you can get people to support

6242
01:46:23,430 --> 01:46:23,440
you can you can get people to support
 

6243
01:46:23,440 --> 01:46:25,030
you can you can get people to support
you not because what you're doing is

6244
01:46:25,030 --> 01:46:25,040
you not because what you're doing is
 

6245
01:46:25,040 --> 01:46:27,270
you not because what you're doing is
good but because you play on their sense

6246
01:46:27,270 --> 01:46:27,280
good but because you play on their sense
 

6247
01:46:27,280 --> 01:46:29,510
good but because you play on their sense
of tribalism in your book you do cost

6248
01:46:29,510 --> 01:46:29,520
of tribalism in your book you do cost
 

6249
01:46:29,520 --> 01:46:32,390
of tribalism in your book you do cost
benefit analysis so you do acknowledge

6250
01:46:32,390 --> 01:46:32,400
benefit analysis so you do acknowledge
 

6251
01:46:32,400 --> 01:46:35,669
benefit analysis so you do acknowledge
or think about the pros of fiat currency

6252
01:46:35,669 --> 01:46:35,679
or think about the pros of fiat currency
 

6253
01:46:35,679 --> 01:46:37,830
or think about the pros of fiat currency
can you

6254
01:46:37,830 --> 01:46:37,840
can you
 

6255
01:46:37,840 --> 01:46:39,510
can you
can you do just that

6256
01:46:39,510 --> 01:46:39,520
can you do just that
 

6257
01:46:39,520 --> 01:46:41,750
can you do just that
look at the benefit and look at the cost

6258
01:46:41,750 --> 01:46:41,760
look at the benefit and look at the cost
 

6259
01:46:41,760 --> 01:46:43,750
look at the benefit and look at the cost
just broadly at the highest level

6260
01:46:43,750 --> 01:46:43,760
just broadly at the highest level
 

6261
01:46:43,760 --> 01:46:45,189
just broadly at the highest level
so the way that i write the fiat

6262
01:46:45,189 --> 01:46:45,199
so the way that i write the fiat
 

6263
01:46:45,199 --> 01:46:47,590
so the way that i write the fiat
standard is that i try and

6264
01:46:47,590 --> 01:46:47,600
standard is that i try and
 

6265
01:46:47,600 --> 01:46:49,430
standard is that i try and
analyze it as an engineering system in

6266
01:46:49,430 --> 01:46:49,440
analyze it as an engineering system in
 

6267
01:46:49,440 --> 01:46:51,030
analyze it as an engineering system in
the same way that i wrote the bitcoin

6268
01:46:51,030 --> 01:46:51,040
the same way that i wrote the bitcoin
 

6269
01:46:51,040 --> 01:46:52,310
the same way that i wrote the bitcoin
standard so with the bitcoin standard i

6270
01:46:52,310 --> 01:46:52,320
standard so with the bitcoin standard i
 

6271
01:46:52,320 --> 01:46:53,990
standard so with the bitcoin standard i
looked at bitcoin from first principles

6272
01:46:53,990 --> 01:46:54,000
looked at bitcoin from first principles
 

6273
01:46:54,000 --> 01:46:56,709
looked at bitcoin from first principles
and tried to explain how it works for

6274
01:46:56,709 --> 01:46:56,719
and tried to explain how it works for
 

6275
01:46:56,719 --> 01:46:58,390
and tried to explain how it works for
a reader that doesn't really have much

6276
01:46:58,390 --> 01:46:58,400
a reader that doesn't really have much
 

6277
01:46:58,400 --> 01:47:00,709
a reader that doesn't really have much
of a background in computer science

6278
01:47:00,709 --> 01:47:00,719
of a background in computer science
 

6279
01:47:00,719 --> 01:47:02,709
of a background in computer science
networks or

6280
01:47:02,709 --> 01:47:02,719
networks or
 

6281
01:47:02,719 --> 01:47:04,470
networks or
economics and i thought i'll do the same

6282
01:47:04,470 --> 01:47:04,480
economics and i thought i'll do the same
 

6283
01:47:04,480 --> 01:47:06,310
economics and i thought i'll do the same
with the fiat you know let's just ignore

6284
01:47:06,310 --> 01:47:06,320
with the fiat you know let's just ignore
 

6285
01:47:06,320 --> 01:47:07,910
with the fiat you know let's just ignore
the official stories and look at how

6286
01:47:07,910 --> 01:47:07,920
the official stories and look at how
 

6287
01:47:07,920 --> 01:47:10,229
the official stories and look at how
this thing actually works

6288
01:47:10,229 --> 01:47:10,239
this thing actually works
 

6289
01:47:10,239 --> 01:47:11,910
this thing actually works
and um

6290
01:47:11,910 --> 01:47:11,920
and um
 

6291
01:47:11,920 --> 01:47:14,310
and um
i think it does have value in the fact

6292
01:47:14,310 --> 01:47:14,320
i think it does have value in the fact
 

6293
01:47:14,320 --> 01:47:16,550
i think it does have value in the fact
that it um you know the reason that it

6294
01:47:16,550 --> 01:47:16,560
that it um you know the reason that it
 

6295
01:47:16,560 --> 01:47:19,270
that it um you know the reason that it
was that they were able to pull it off

6296
01:47:19,270 --> 01:47:19,280
was that they were able to pull it off
 

6297
01:47:19,280 --> 01:47:20,390
was that they were able to pull it off
is because

6298
01:47:20,390 --> 01:47:20,400
is because
 

6299
01:47:20,400 --> 01:47:23,030
is because
it was not possible for people who don't

6300
01:47:23,030 --> 01:47:23,040
it was not possible for people who don't
 

6301
01:47:23,040 --> 01:47:23,910
it was not possible for people who don't
uh

6302
01:47:23,910 --> 01:47:23,920
uh
 

6303
01:47:23,920 --> 01:47:26,550
uh
want to be part of it to use gold

6304
01:47:26,550 --> 01:47:26,560
want to be part of it to use gold
 

6305
01:47:26,560 --> 01:47:28,149
want to be part of it to use gold
independently of governments this is

6306
01:47:28,149 --> 01:47:28,159
independently of governments this is
 

6307
01:47:28,159 --> 01:47:30,470
independently of governments this is
really the key thing gold is just very

6308
01:47:30,470 --> 01:47:30,480
really the key thing gold is just very
 

6309
01:47:30,480 --> 01:47:32,790
really the key thing gold is just very
expensive to move around and

6310
01:47:32,790 --> 01:47:32,800
expensive to move around and
 

6311
01:47:32,800 --> 01:47:33,990
expensive to move around and
um

6312
01:47:33,990 --> 01:47:34,000
um
 

6313
01:47:34,000 --> 01:47:35,590
um
the fact that it is expensive to move

6314
01:47:35,590 --> 01:47:35,600
the fact that it is expensive to move
 

6315
01:47:35,600 --> 01:47:37,189
the fact that it is expensive to move
around means that

6316
01:47:37,189 --> 01:47:37,199
around means that
 

6317
01:47:37,199 --> 01:47:39,189
around means that
uh there's

6318
01:47:39,189 --> 01:47:39,199
uh there's
 

6319
01:47:39,199 --> 01:47:41,189
uh there's
there's inevitably going to emerge

6320
01:47:41,189 --> 01:47:41,199
there's inevitably going to emerge
 

6321
01:47:41,199 --> 01:47:43,510
there's inevitably going to emerge
institutions where it is centralized in

6322
01:47:43,510 --> 01:47:43,520
institutions where it is centralized in
 

6323
01:47:43,520 --> 01:47:44,950
institutions where it is centralized in
physical location

6324
01:47:44,950 --> 01:47:44,960
physical location
 

6325
01:47:44,960 --> 01:47:47,270
physical location
and then these institutions trade

6326
01:47:47,270 --> 01:47:47,280
and then these institutions trade
 

6327
01:47:47,280 --> 01:47:49,750
and then these institutions trade
liabilities for the gold so really the

6328
01:47:49,750 --> 01:47:49,760
liabilities for the gold so really the
 

6329
01:47:49,760 --> 01:47:53,510
liabilities for the gold so really the
gold standard

6330
01:47:53,510 --> 01:47:53,520

 

6331
01:47:53,520 --> 01:47:56,390

intrinsically must involve credit as

6332
01:47:56,390 --> 01:47:56,400
intrinsically must involve credit as
 

6333
01:47:56,400 --> 01:47:58,950
intrinsically must involve credit as
becoming part of the monetary system it

6334
01:47:58,950 --> 01:47:58,960
becoming part of the monetary system it
 

6335
01:47:58,960 --> 01:48:00,950
becoming part of the monetary system it
has to be the credit and because it gets

6336
01:48:00,950 --> 01:48:00,960
has to be the credit and because it gets
 

6337
01:48:00,960 --> 01:48:02,629
has to be the credit and because it gets
centralized can easily be captured by

6338
01:48:02,629 --> 01:48:02,639
centralized can easily be captured by
 

6339
01:48:02,639 --> 01:48:06,070
centralized can easily be captured by
the government so to be fair

6340
01:48:06,070 --> 01:48:06,080
the government so to be fair
 

6341
01:48:06,080 --> 01:48:07,830
the government so to be fair
the benefit of the fiat system is that

6342
01:48:07,830 --> 01:48:07,840
the benefit of the fiat system is that
 

6343
01:48:07,840 --> 01:48:09,750
the benefit of the fiat system is that
it saves us on the cost of moving gold

6344
01:48:09,750 --> 01:48:09,760
it saves us on the cost of moving gold
 

6345
01:48:09,760 --> 01:48:11,830
it saves us on the cost of moving gold
around which is pretty significant like

6346
01:48:11,830 --> 01:48:11,840
around which is pretty significant like
 

6347
01:48:11,840 --> 01:48:14,470
around which is pretty significant like
generally you know moving a bar of gold

6348
01:48:14,470 --> 01:48:14,480
generally you know moving a bar of gold
 

6349
01:48:14,480 --> 01:48:16,390
generally you know moving a bar of gold
across the atlantic is going to cost

6350
01:48:16,390 --> 01:48:16,400
across the atlantic is going to cost
 

6351
01:48:16,400 --> 01:48:18,149
across the atlantic is going to cost
somewhere between point one to one

6352
01:48:18,149 --> 01:48:18,159
somewhere between point one to one
 

6353
01:48:18,159 --> 01:48:21,030
somewhere between point one to one
percent of the cost of the gold bar so

6354
01:48:21,030 --> 01:48:21,040
percent of the cost of the gold bar so
 

6355
01:48:21,040 --> 01:48:23,109
percent of the cost of the gold bar so
you move it 100 times back and forth

6356
01:48:23,109 --> 01:48:23,119
you move it 100 times back and forth
 

6357
01:48:23,119 --> 01:48:24,550
you move it 100 times back and forth
between the atlantic you need to pay the

6358
01:48:24,550 --> 01:48:24,560
between the atlantic you need to pay the
 

6359
01:48:24,560 --> 01:48:26,550
between the atlantic you need to pay the
whole gold bar the cost of the whole

6360
01:48:26,550 --> 01:48:26,560
whole gold bar the cost of the whole
 

6361
01:48:26,560 --> 01:48:28,950
whole gold bar the cost of the whole
gold bar to move it 100 times across

6362
01:48:28,950 --> 01:48:28,960
gold bar to move it 100 times across
 

6363
01:48:28,960 --> 01:48:30,470
gold bar to move it 100 times across
well with fiat money with it's

6364
01:48:30,470 --> 01:48:30,480
well with fiat money with it's
 

6365
01:48:30,480 --> 01:48:32,149
well with fiat money with it's
essentially government credit and so

6366
01:48:32,149 --> 01:48:32,159
essentially government credit and so
 

6367
01:48:32,159 --> 01:48:34,390
essentially government credit and so
it's just um sending a message from

6368
01:48:34,390 --> 01:48:34,400
it's just um sending a message from
 

6369
01:48:34,400 --> 01:48:36,950
it's just um sending a message from
one's central bank to another and you

6370
01:48:36,950 --> 01:48:36,960
one's central bank to another and you
 

6371
01:48:36,960 --> 01:48:38,950
one's central bank to another and you
can move it halfway around the world is

6372
01:48:38,950 --> 01:48:38,960
can move it halfway around the world is
 

6373
01:48:38,960 --> 01:48:40,390
can move it halfway around the world is
there also something to be said about

6374
01:48:40,390 --> 01:48:40,400
there also something to be said about
 

6375
01:48:40,400 --> 01:48:42,870
there also something to be said about
the cost in time so you're saving the

6376
01:48:42,870 --> 01:48:42,880
the cost in time so you're saving the
 

6377
01:48:42,880 --> 01:48:45,030
the cost in time so you're saving the
sort of you're reducing the friction

6378
01:48:45,030 --> 01:48:45,040
sort of you're reducing the friction
 

6379
01:48:45,040 --> 01:48:47,109
sort of you're reducing the friction
yeah the communication as well exactly

6380
01:48:47,109 --> 01:48:47,119
yeah the communication as well exactly
 

6381
01:48:47,119 --> 01:48:49,109
yeah the communication as well exactly
of the transactions as well exactly it's

6382
01:48:49,109 --> 01:48:49,119
of the transactions as well exactly it's
 

6383
01:48:49,119 --> 01:48:51,109
of the transactions as well exactly it's
faster

6384
01:48:51,109 --> 01:48:51,119
faster
 

6385
01:48:51,119 --> 01:48:53,430
faster
how big is that benefit because wouldn't

6386
01:48:53,430 --> 01:48:53,440
how big is that benefit because wouldn't
 

6387
01:48:53,440 --> 01:48:55,109
how big is that benefit because wouldn't
you argue that that potential is the

6388
01:48:55,109 --> 01:48:55,119
you argue that that potential is the
 

6389
01:48:55,119 --> 01:48:57,510
you argue that that potential is the
thing that enables modern economy both

6390
01:48:57,510 --> 01:48:57,520
thing that enables modern economy both
 

6391
01:48:57,520 --> 01:48:59,669
thing that enables modern economy both
the speed and the low cost so increasing

6392
01:48:59,669 --> 01:48:59,679
the speed and the low cost so increasing
 

6393
01:48:59,679 --> 01:49:02,470
the speed and the low cost so increasing
the scale and the frequency the speed of

6394
01:49:02,470 --> 01:49:02,480
the scale and the frequency the speed of
 

6395
01:49:02,480 --> 01:49:05,590
the scale and the frequency the speed of
the transactions yeah arguably it does

6396
01:49:05,590 --> 01:49:05,600
the transactions yeah arguably it does
 

6397
01:49:05,600 --> 01:49:08,629
the transactions yeah arguably it does
help in that regard however it isn't as

6398
01:49:08,629 --> 01:49:08,639
help in that regard however it isn't as
 

6399
01:49:08,639 --> 01:49:11,109
help in that regard however it isn't as
if you couldn't have fast transactions

6400
01:49:11,109 --> 01:49:11,119
if you couldn't have fast transactions
 

6401
01:49:11,119 --> 01:49:12,870
if you couldn't have fast transactions
built on top of gold so you could have

6402
01:49:12,870 --> 01:49:12,880
built on top of gold so you could have
 

6403
01:49:12,880 --> 01:49:15,350
built on top of gold so you could have
gold being used for final settlement

6404
01:49:15,350 --> 01:49:15,360
gold being used for final settlement
 

6405
01:49:15,360 --> 01:49:18,229
gold being used for final settlement
and you could have um you know banks

6406
01:49:18,229 --> 01:49:18,239
and you could have um you know banks
 

6407
01:49:18,239 --> 01:49:19,510
and you could have um you know banks
settling with one another you

6408
01:49:19,510 --> 01:49:19,520
settling with one another you
 

6409
01:49:19,520 --> 01:49:21,669
settling with one another you
essentially using credits can you define

6410
01:49:21,669 --> 01:49:21,679
essentially using credits can you define
 

6411
01:49:21,679 --> 01:49:22,790
essentially using credits can you define
settlement

6412
01:49:22,790 --> 01:49:22,800
settlement
 

6413
01:49:22,800 --> 01:49:23,750
settlement
just for

6414
01:49:23,750 --> 01:49:23,760
just for
 

6415
01:49:23,760 --> 01:49:25,189
just for
people who are outside this world

6416
01:49:25,189 --> 01:49:25,199
people who are outside this world
 

6417
01:49:25,199 --> 01:49:26,629
people who are outside this world
because we'll mention that word quite a

6418
01:49:26,629 --> 01:49:26,639
because we'll mention that word quite a
 

6419
01:49:26,639 --> 01:49:28,310
because we'll mention that word quite a
bit probably good question so the way

6420
01:49:28,310 --> 01:49:28,320
bit probably good question so the way
 

6421
01:49:28,320 --> 01:49:29,910
bit probably good question so the way
that it works is let's say right now i'm

6422
01:49:29,910 --> 01:49:29,920
that it works is let's say right now i'm

it didn't also happen in those 10
seconds that my bank which could be in

6436
01:49:48,310 --> 01:49:48,320
seconds that my bank which could be in

it's
 

6445
01:49:54,639 --> 01:49:55,910
it's
there's a lot of infrastructure

6446
01:49:55,910 --> 01:49:55,920
there's a lot of infrastructure
 

6447
01:49:55,920 --> 01:49:57,669
there's a lot of infrastructure
underneath that so what actually

6448
01:49:57,669 --> 01:49:57,679
underneath that so what actually
 

6449
01:49:57,679 --> 01:49:59,270
underneath that so what actually
happened is that i have an account with

6450

6475
01:50:24,480 --> 01:50:25,830
another so they won't you know they

6486
01:50:36,310 --> 01:50:36,320
settle the difference so turns out at
 

6487
01:50:36,320 --> 01:50:38,950
settle the difference so turns out at
the end of the month my bank had sent 15

6488
01:50:38,950 --> 01:50:38,960
the end of the month my bank had sent 15
 

6489
01:50:38,960 --> 01:50:40,550

million dollars to your bank and your

6490

bank had sent 14 million dollars to my
bank

6494
01:50:43,430 --> 01:50:43,440
bank
 

6495
01:50:43,440 --> 01:50:45,910
bank
so they give them one million dollars

6496
01:50:45,910 --> 01:50:45,920
so they give them one million dollars
 

6497
01:50:45,920 --> 01:50:47,669
so they give them one million dollars
and that settles it that finalizes the

6498
01:50:47,669 --> 01:50:47,679
and that settles it that finalizes the
 

6499
01:50:47,679 --> 01:50:48,870
and that settles it that finalizes the
transaction

6500
01:50:48,870 --> 01:50:48,880
transaction
 

6501
01:50:48,880 --> 01:50:51,750
transaction
so final settlement 3d is like the you

6502
01:50:51,750 --> 01:50:51,760
so final settlement 3d is like the you
 

6503
01:50:51,760 --> 01:50:53,750
so final settlement 3d is like the you
can think about it as the infrastructure

6504
01:50:53,750 --> 01:50:53,760
can think about it as the infrastructure
 

6505
01:50:53,760 --> 01:50:56,070
can think about it as the infrastructure
of the system and then you can think of

6506
01:50:56,070 --> 01:50:56,080
of the system and then you can think of
 

6507
01:50:56,080 --> 01:50:57,910
of the system and then you can think of
these things as being the

6508
01:50:57,910 --> 01:50:57,920
these things as being the
 

6509
01:50:57,920 --> 01:50:59,830
these things as being the
higher layer levels and you had a

6510
01:50:59,830 --> 01:50:59,840
higher layer levels and you had a
 

6511
01:50:59,840 --> 01:51:01,350
higher layer levels and you had a
wonderful discussion about that with the

6512
01:51:01,350 --> 01:51:01,360
wonderful discussion about that with the
 

6513
01:51:01,360 --> 01:51:03,750
wonderful discussion about that with the
michael saylor so the final settlement

6514
01:51:03,750 --> 01:51:03,760
michael saylor so the final settlement
 

6515
01:51:03,760 --> 01:51:07,189
michael saylor so the final settlement
is like the the the moment when you

6516
01:51:07,189 --> 01:51:07,199
is like the the the moment when you
 

6517
01:51:07,199 --> 01:51:09,109
is like the the the moment when you
paper and ideas connect to physical

6518
01:51:09,109 --> 01:51:09,119
paper and ideas connect to physical
 

6519
01:51:09,119 --> 01:51:11,430
paper and ideas connect to physical
reality a uh

6520
01:51:11,430 --> 01:51:11,440
reality a uh
 

6521
01:51:11,440 --> 01:51:13,109
reality a uh
yeah or just some representation of

6522
01:51:13,109 --> 01:51:13,119
yeah or just some representation of
 

6523
01:51:13,119 --> 01:51:15,510
yeah or just some representation of
physical reality yeah and under gold

6524
01:51:15,510 --> 01:51:15,520
physical reality yeah and under gold
 

6525
01:51:15,520 --> 01:51:17,189
physical reality yeah and under gold
everything was tethered to physical

6526
01:51:17,189 --> 01:51:17,199
everything was tethered to physical
 

6527
01:51:17,199 --> 01:51:18,470
everything was tethered to physical
reality because there was a market

6528
01:51:18,470 --> 01:51:18,480
reality because there was a market
 

6529
01:51:18,480 --> 01:51:20,390
reality because there was a market
commodity at the bottom of all of this

6530
01:51:20,390 --> 01:51:20,400
commodity at the bottom of all of this
 

6531
01:51:20,400 --> 01:51:21,830
commodity at the bottom of all of this
and nobody could print that market

6532
01:51:21,830 --> 01:51:21,840
and nobody could print that market
 

6533
01:51:21,840 --> 01:51:23,910
and nobody could print that market
commodity and so at the end of the month

6534
01:51:23,910 --> 01:51:23,920
commodity and so at the end of the month
 

6535
01:51:23,920 --> 01:51:26,310
commodity and so at the end of the month
if your bank made too many payments if

6536
01:51:26,310 --> 01:51:26,320
if your bank made too many payments if
 

6537
01:51:26,320 --> 01:51:28,310
if your bank made too many payments if
you made too many payments there was a

6538
01:51:28,310 --> 01:51:28,320
you made too many payments there was a
 

6539
01:51:28,320 --> 01:51:30,149
you made too many payments there was a
reckoning there you know if you were

6540
01:51:30,149 --> 01:51:30,159
reckoning there you know if you were
 

6541
01:51:30,159 --> 01:51:32,950
reckoning there you know if you were
reckless if you were insolvent

6542
01:51:32,950 --> 01:51:32,960
reckless if you were insolvent
 

6543
01:51:32,960 --> 01:51:34,390
reckless if you were insolvent
you went out of business

6544
01:51:34,390 --> 01:51:34,400
you went out of business
 

6545
01:51:34,400 --> 01:51:36,310
you went out of business
so there was no um

6546
01:51:36,310 --> 01:51:36,320
so there was no um
 

6547
01:51:36,320 --> 01:51:38,149
so there was no um
there was no way to fool that but then

6548
01:51:38,149 --> 01:51:38,159
there was no way to fool that but then
 

6549
01:51:38,159 --> 01:51:40,709
there was no way to fool that but then
we moved to the fiat century and

6550
01:51:40,709 --> 01:51:40,719
we moved to the fiat century and
 

6551
01:51:40,719 --> 01:51:42,310
we moved to the fiat century and
everything is credit at the end of the

6552
01:51:42,310 --> 01:51:42,320
everything is credit at the end of the
 

6553
01:51:42,320 --> 01:51:45,589
everything is credit at the end of the
day the final layer is government credit

6554
01:51:45,589 --> 01:51:45,599
day the final layer is government credit
 

6555
01:51:45,599 --> 01:51:46,870
day the final layer is government credit
and so

6556
01:51:46,870 --> 01:51:46,880
and so
 

6557
01:51:46,880 --> 01:51:48,070
and so
as long as you're friends with the

6558
01:51:48,070 --> 01:51:48,080
as long as you're friends with the
 

6559
01:51:48,080 --> 01:51:49,430
as long as you're friends with the
government basically you never go

6560
01:51:49,430 --> 01:51:49,440
government basically you never go
 

6561
01:51:49,440 --> 01:51:51,669
government basically you never go
bankrupt so

6562
01:51:51,669 --> 01:51:51,679
bankrupt so
 

6563
01:51:51,679 --> 01:51:53,750
bankrupt so
all kinds of hucksters manage to find

6564
01:51:53,750 --> 01:51:53,760
all kinds of hucksters manage to find
 

6565
01:51:53,760 --> 01:51:55,030
all kinds of hucksters manage to find
their way into

6566
01:51:55,030 --> 01:51:55,040
their way into
 

6567
01:51:55,040 --> 01:51:57,189
their way into
um you know getting into position where

6568
01:51:57,189 --> 01:51:57,199
um you know getting into position where
 

6569
01:51:57,199 --> 01:51:59,990
um you know getting into position where
they don't get bankrupt so in part two

6570
01:51:59,990 --> 01:52:00,000
they don't get bankrupt so in part two
 

6571
01:52:00,000 --> 01:52:02,790
they don't get bankrupt so in part two
of the fiat standard called fiat life

6572
01:52:02,790 --> 01:52:02,800
of the fiat standard called fiat life
 

6573
01:52:02,800 --> 01:52:04,229
of the fiat standard called fiat life
you describe the effects if you have

6574
01:52:04,229 --> 01:52:04,239
you describe the effects if you have
 

6575
01:52:04,239 --> 01:52:06,790
you describe the effects if you have
money on a bunch of things like life

6576
01:52:06,790 --> 01:52:06,800
money on a bunch of things like life
 

6577
01:52:06,800 --> 01:52:10,629
money on a bunch of things like life
food science education

6578
01:52:10,629 --> 01:52:10,639

 

6579
01:52:10,639 --> 01:52:12,550

what is the most pernicious effect of

6580
01:52:12,550 --> 01:52:12,560
what is the most pernicious effect of
 

6581
01:52:12,560 --> 01:52:13,910
what is the most pernicious effect of
fiat money

6582
01:52:13,910 --> 01:52:13,920
fiat money
 

6583
01:52:13,920 --> 01:52:16,310
fiat money
on our world on our life so it's taking

6584
01:52:16,310 --> 01:52:16,320
on our world on our life so it's taking
 

6585
01:52:16,320 --> 01:52:18,070
on our world on our life so it's taking
a step outside the monetary system

6586
01:52:18,070 --> 01:52:18,080
a step outside the monetary system
 

6587
01:52:18,080 --> 01:52:20,470
a step outside the monetary system
actually like how that affects our life

6588
01:52:20,470 --> 01:52:20,480
actually like how that affects our life
 

6589
01:52:20,480 --> 01:52:22,390
actually like how that affects our life
from this book i mean there's there's a

6590
01:52:22,390 --> 01:52:22,400
from this book i mean there's there's a
 

6591
01:52:22,400 --> 01:52:24,390
from this book i mean there's there's a
whole bunch of things and i i won't be

6592
01:52:24,390 --> 01:52:24,400
whole bunch of things and i i won't be
 

6593
01:52:24,400 --> 01:52:25,830
whole bunch of things and i i won't be
able to go over them and i highly

6594
01:52:25,830 --> 01:52:25,840
able to go over them and i highly
 

6595
01:52:25,840 --> 01:52:27,189
able to go over them and i highly
recommend reading the book but if i were

6596
01:52:27,189 --> 01:52:27,199
recommend reading the book but if i were
 

6597
01:52:27,199 --> 01:52:29,350
recommend reading the book but if i were
to pick one i would say it's the impact

6598
01:52:29,350 --> 01:52:29,360
to pick one i would say it's the impact
 

6599
01:52:29,360 --> 01:52:31,350
to pick one i would say it's the impact
that it has on our time preference

6600
01:52:31,350 --> 01:52:31,360
that it has on our time preference
 

6601
01:52:31,360 --> 01:52:34,229
that it has on our time preference
on our valuation of the future so

6602
01:52:34,229 --> 01:52:34,239
on our valuation of the future so
 

6603
01:52:34,239 --> 01:52:35,510
on our valuation of the future so
remember when we started the discussion

6604
01:52:35,510 --> 01:52:35,520
remember when we started the discussion
 

6605
01:52:35,520 --> 01:52:37,750
remember when we started the discussion
i said that the um

6606
01:52:37,750 --> 01:52:37,760
i said that the um
 

6607
01:52:37,760 --> 01:52:39,589
i said that the um
a key function of money is that it

6608
01:52:39,589 --> 01:52:39,599
a key function of money is that it
 

6609
01:52:39,599 --> 01:52:41,589
a key function of money is that it
serves as a store of value and the

6610
01:52:41,589 --> 01:52:41,599
serves as a store of value and the
 

6611
01:52:41,599 --> 01:52:44,310
serves as a store of value and the
harder the money is the better it is at

6612
01:52:44,310 --> 01:52:44,320
harder the money is the better it is at
 

6613
01:52:44,320 --> 01:52:46,709
harder the money is the better it is at
providing us with the way for providing

6614
01:52:46,709 --> 01:52:46,719
providing us with the way for providing
 

6615
01:52:46,719 --> 01:52:48,790
providing us with the way for providing
for our future and so the harder the

6616
01:52:48,790 --> 01:52:48,800
for our future and so the harder the
 

6617
01:52:48,800 --> 01:52:51,189
for our future and so the harder the
money is the less we discount the future

6618
01:52:51,189 --> 01:52:51,199
money is the less we discount the future
 

6619
01:52:51,199 --> 01:52:52,550
money is the less we discount the future
we always discount the future compared

6620
01:52:52,550 --> 01:52:52,560
we always discount the future compared
 

6621
01:52:52,560 --> 01:52:54,310
we always discount the future compared
to the present so if i told you i'm

6622
01:52:54,310 --> 01:52:54,320
to the present so if i told you i'm
 

6623
01:52:54,320 --> 01:52:56,070
to the present so if i told you i'm
going to give you something today

6624
01:52:56,070 --> 01:52:56,080
going to give you something today
 

6625
01:52:56,080 --> 01:52:57,910
going to give you something today
versus giving it to you 10 years from

6626
01:52:57,910 --> 01:52:57,920
versus giving it to you 10 years from
 

6627
01:52:57,920 --> 01:53:00,149
versus giving it to you 10 years from
now the same thing you would prefer to

6628
01:53:00,149 --> 01:53:00,159
now the same thing you would prefer to
 

6629
01:53:00,159 --> 01:53:01,510
now the same thing you would prefer to
take it now because then you'd get to

6630
01:53:01,510 --> 01:53:01,520
take it now because then you'd get to
 

6631
01:53:01,520 --> 01:53:03,430
take it now because then you'd get to
enjoy it over the next 10 years so we

6632
01:53:03,430 --> 01:53:03,440
enjoy it over the next 10 years so we
 

6633
01:53:03,440 --> 01:53:06,550
enjoy it over the next 10 years so we
always prefer the present to the future

6634
01:53:06,550 --> 01:53:06,560
always prefer the present to the future
 

6635
01:53:06,560 --> 01:53:08,950
always prefer the present to the future
there's always a discount on the future

6636
01:53:08,950 --> 01:53:08,960
there's always a discount on the future
 

6637
01:53:08,960 --> 01:53:10,229
there's always a discount on the future
and that discount is called time

6638
01:53:10,229 --> 01:53:10,239
and that discount is called time
 

6639
01:53:10,239 --> 01:53:12,310
and that discount is called time
preference the degree to which we prefer

6640
01:53:12,310 --> 01:53:12,320
preference the degree to which we prefer
 

6641
01:53:12,320 --> 01:53:13,910
preference the degree to which we prefer
the present to the future is called our

6642
01:53:13,910 --> 01:53:13,920
the present to the future is called our
 

6643
01:53:13,920 --> 01:53:15,350
the present to the future is called our
time preference

6644
01:53:15,350 --> 01:53:15,360
time preference
 

6645
01:53:15,360 --> 01:53:17,910
time preference
so the higher uh

6646
01:53:17,910 --> 01:53:17,920
so the higher uh
 

6647
01:53:17,920 --> 01:53:19,510
so the higher uh
our time preference the less we care

6648
01:53:19,510 --> 01:53:19,520
our time preference the less we care
 

6649
01:53:19,520 --> 01:53:21,350
our time preference the less we care
about the future and the process of

6650
01:53:21,350 --> 01:53:21,360
about the future and the process of
 

6651
01:53:21,360 --> 01:53:23,350
about the future and the process of
civilization is the process of lowering

6652
01:53:23,350 --> 01:53:23,360
civilization is the process of lowering
 

6653
01:53:23,360 --> 01:53:25,030
civilization is the process of lowering
our time preference where we start

6654
01:53:25,030 --> 01:53:25,040
our time preference where we start
 

6655
01:53:25,040 --> 01:53:27,589
our time preference where we start
caring more for the future we start

6656
01:53:27,589 --> 01:53:27,599
caring more for the future we start
 

6657
01:53:27,599 --> 01:53:29,589
caring more for the future we start
prioritizing the present less and less

6658
01:53:29,589 --> 01:53:29,599
prioritizing the present less and less
 

6659
01:53:29,599 --> 01:53:31,750
prioritizing the present less and less
so we start being able to

6660
01:53:31,750 --> 01:53:31,760
so we start being able to
 

6661
01:53:31,760 --> 01:53:33,669
so we start being able to
not consume everything that we have and

6662
01:53:33,669 --> 01:53:33,679
not consume everything that we have and
 

6663
01:53:33,679 --> 01:53:36,229
not consume everything that we have and
store it and so money is essential for

6664
01:53:36,229 --> 01:53:36,239
store it and so money is essential for
 

6665
01:53:36,239 --> 01:53:38,550
store it and so money is essential for
that and under the gold standard

6666
01:53:38,550 --> 01:53:38,560
that and under the gold standard
 

6667
01:53:38,560 --> 01:53:40,629
that and under the gold standard
everyone in the world had the ability to

6668
01:53:40,629 --> 01:53:40,639
everyone in the world had the ability to
 

6669
01:53:40,639 --> 01:53:43,030
everyone in the world had the ability to
provide for their future by simply using

6670
01:53:43,030 --> 01:53:43,040
provide for their future by simply using
 

6671
01:53:43,040 --> 01:53:44,310
provide for their future by simply using
the same money that they use you know

6672
01:53:44,310 --> 01:53:44,320
the same money that they use you know
 

6673
01:53:44,320 --> 01:53:46,070
the same money that they use you know
you would work a day and you would get

6674
01:53:46,070 --> 01:53:46,080
you would work a day and you would get
 

6675
01:53:46,080 --> 01:53:48,070
you would work a day and you would get
paid in a gold coin and you could take

6676
01:53:48,070 --> 01:53:48,080
paid in a gold coin and you could take
 

6677
01:53:48,080 --> 01:53:49,750
paid in a gold coin and you could take
that gold coin and

6678
01:53:49,750 --> 01:53:49,760
that gold coin and
 

6679
01:53:49,760 --> 01:53:52,310
that gold coin and
keep it safe for 10 years and know that

6680
01:53:52,310 --> 01:53:52,320
keep it safe for 10 years and know that
 

6681
01:53:52,320 --> 01:53:54,470
keep it safe for 10 years and know that
at the end of those 10 years that gold

6682
01:53:54,470 --> 01:53:54,480
at the end of those 10 years that gold
 

6683
01:53:54,480 --> 01:53:56,709
at the end of those 10 years that gold
coin would buy you slightly more than

6684
01:53:56,709 --> 01:53:56,719
coin would buy you slightly more than
 

6685
01:53:56,719 --> 01:53:58,390
coin would buy you slightly more than
what it bought you the day that you

6686
01:53:58,390 --> 01:53:58,400
what it bought you the day that you
 

6687
01:53:58,400 --> 01:54:00,550
what it bought you the day that you
earned it so anybody could provide for

6688
01:54:00,550 --> 01:54:00,560
earned it so anybody could provide for
 

6689
01:54:00,560 --> 01:54:02,870
earned it so anybody could provide for
their future and anybody could have very

6690
01:54:02,870 --> 01:54:02,880
their future and anybody could have very
 

6691
01:54:02,880 --> 01:54:05,990
their future and anybody could have very
high degree of certainty that whatever

6692
01:54:05,990 --> 01:54:06,000
high degree of certainty that whatever
 

6693
01:54:06,000 --> 01:54:08,310
high degree of certainty that whatever
they're saving is going to be there when

6694
01:54:08,310 --> 01:54:08,320
they're saving is going to be there when
 

6695
01:54:08,320 --> 01:54:10,229
they're saving is going to be there when
they want it in the future

6696
01:54:10,229 --> 01:54:10,239
they want it in the future
 

6697
01:54:10,239 --> 01:54:11,510
they want it in the future
because the money supply was only

6698
01:54:11,510 --> 01:54:11,520
because the money supply was only
 

6699
01:54:11,520 --> 01:54:13,350
because the money supply was only
increasing at one and a half percent

6700

increasing at one and a half percent
 

6701
01:54:13,360 --> 01:54:16,310
increasing at one and a half percent
whereas the um production of goods and

01:54:16,310 --> 01:54:16,320
whereas the um production of goods and
 

6703
01:54:16,320 --> 01:54:19,910
whereas the um production of goods and
services was increasing for most cases

6704
01:54:19,910 --> 01:54:19,920
services was increasing for most cases
 

6705
01:54:19,920 --> 01:54:21,750
services was increasing for most cases
for most periods at a higher rate than

6706
01:54:21,750 --> 01:54:21,760
for most periods at a higher rate than
 

6707
01:54:21,760 --> 01:54:23,990
for most periods at a higher rate than
that so you could buy more apples and

6708
01:54:23,990 --> 01:54:24,000
that so you could buy more apples and
 

6709
01:54:24,000 --> 01:54:26,070
that so you could buy more apples and
oranges and houses and cars

6710
01:54:26,070 --> 01:54:26,080
oranges and houses and cars
 

6711
01:54:26,080 --> 01:54:27,830
oranges and houses and cars
at the end of the 10 years than you

6712
01:54:27,830 --> 01:54:27,840
at the end of the 10 years than you
 

6713
01:54:27,840 --> 01:54:29,109
at the end of the 10 years than you
could at the beginning of the 10 years

6714
01:54:29,109 --> 01:54:29,119
could at the beginning of the 10 years
 

6715
01:54:29,119 --> 01:54:30,629
could at the beginning of the 10 years
so everybody had a way of providing for

6716
01:54:30,629 --> 01:54:30,639
so everybody had a way of providing for
 

6717
01:54:30,639 --> 01:54:33,270
so everybody had a way of providing for
the future and with that people lower

6718
01:54:33,270 --> 01:54:33,280
the future and with that people lower
 

6719
01:54:33,280 --> 01:54:35,270
the future and with that people lower
their time preference and that is

6720
01:54:35,270 --> 01:54:35,280
their time preference and that is
 

6721
01:54:35,280 --> 01:54:38,149
their time preference and that is
reflected across all aspects of uh life

6722
01:54:38,149 --> 01:54:38,159
reflected across all aspects of uh life
 

6723
01:54:38,159 --> 01:54:39,910
reflected across all aspects of uh life
i think it's not just the economic thing

6724
01:54:39,910 --> 01:54:39,920
i think it's not just the economic thing
 

6725
01:54:39,920 --> 01:54:41,350
i think it's not just the economic thing
you see it in the savings rate you know

6726
01:54:41,350 --> 01:54:41,360
you see it in the savings rate you know
 

6727
01:54:41,360 --> 01:54:43,189
you see it in the savings rate you know
the ability to deny yourself

6728
01:54:43,189 --> 01:54:43,199
the ability to deny yourself
 

6729
01:54:43,199 --> 01:54:45,510
the ability to deny yourself
gratification today i could take the

6730
01:54:45,510 --> 01:54:45,520
gratification today i could take the
 

6731
01:54:45,520 --> 01:54:47,350
gratification today i could take the
money that i have and

6732
01:54:47,350 --> 01:54:47,360
money that i have and
 

6733
01:54:47,360 --> 01:54:49,589
money that i have and

going to do that i'm going to keep it so

6738
01:54:53,589 --> 01:54:53,599
going to do that i'm going to keep it so
 

6739

better life
 

6747
01:55:01,280 --> 01:55:02,149
better life
so

6748
01:55:02,149 --> 01:55:02,159
so
 

6749
01:55:02,159 --> 01:55:04,070
so
all of human civilization really is the

6750
01:55:04,070 --> 01:55:04,080
all of human civilization really is the
 

6751
01:55:04,080 --> 01:55:05,669
all of human civilization really is the
process of us lowering our time

6752
01:55:05,669 --> 01:55:05,679
process of us lowering our time
 

6753
01:55:05,679 --> 01:55:08,390
process of us lowering our time
preference and finding harder monies

6754
01:55:08,390 --> 01:55:08,400
preference and finding harder monies
 

6755
01:55:08,400 --> 01:55:10,070
preference and finding harder monies
that allow us to provide better for the

6756
01:55:10,070 --> 01:55:10,080
that allow us to provide better for the
 

6757
01:55:10,080 --> 01:55:13,830
that allow us to provide better for the
future is how we really technologically

6758
01:55:13,830 --> 01:55:13,840
future is how we really technologically
 

6759
01:55:13,840 --> 01:55:15,109
future is how we really technologically
we do that it's

6760
01:55:15,109 --> 01:55:15,119
we do that it's
 

6761
01:55:15,119 --> 01:55:17,830
we do that it's
i think of the hardness of money as

6762
01:55:17,830 --> 01:55:17,840
i think of the hardness of money as
 

6763
01:55:17,840 --> 01:55:19,750
i think of the hardness of money as
being the control knob for our time

6764
01:55:19,750 --> 01:55:19,760
being the control knob for our time
 

6765
01:55:19,760 --> 01:55:21,589
being the control knob for our time
preference and you can see this

6766
01:55:21,589 --> 01:55:21,599
preference and you can see this
 

6767
01:55:21,599 --> 01:55:23,910
preference and you can see this
reflected in the 20th century where we

6768
01:55:23,910 --> 01:55:23,920
reflected in the 20th century where we
 

6769
01:55:23,920 --> 01:55:26,149
reflected in the 20th century where we
go from the money supply increases at

6770
01:55:26,149 --> 01:55:26,159
go from the money supply increases at
 

6771
01:55:26,159 --> 01:55:28,709
go from the money supply increases at
around one and a half percent under gold

6772
01:55:28,709 --> 01:55:28,719
around one and a half percent under gold
 

6773
01:55:28,719 --> 01:55:30,550
around one and a half percent under gold
to this current situation where over the

6774
01:55:30,550 --> 01:55:30,560
to this current situation where over the
 

6775
01:55:30,560 --> 01:55:32,950
to this current situation where over the
last 60 years i ran the numbers on money

6776
01:55:32,950 --> 01:55:32,960
last 60 years i ran the numbers on money
 

6777
01:55:32,960 --> 01:55:35,750
last 60 years i ran the numbers on money
supply and fiat the global fiat supply

6778
01:55:35,750 --> 01:55:35,760
supply and fiat the global fiat supply
 

6779
01:55:35,760 --> 01:55:38,070
supply and fiat the global fiat supply
has increased at around 14 per year so

6780
01:55:38,070 --> 01:55:38,080
has increased at around 14 per year so
 

6781
01:55:38,080 --> 01:55:40,390
has increased at around 14 per year so
we've done a 10x in the increase in the

6782
01:55:40,390 --> 01:55:40,400
we've done a 10x in the increase in the
 

6783
01:55:40,400 --> 01:55:44,310
we've done a 10x in the increase in the
supply of money annually and 14 is a

6784
01:55:44,310 --> 01:55:44,320
supply of money annually and 14 is a
 

6785
01:55:44,320 --> 01:55:46,790
supply of money annually and 14 is a
weighted average so um

6786
01:55:46,790 --> 01:55:46,800
weighted average so um
 

6787
01:55:46,800 --> 01:55:48,310
weighted average so um
if you take a basic numerical average

6788
01:55:48,310 --> 01:55:48,320
if you take a basic numerical average
 

6789
01:55:48,320 --> 01:55:49,990
if you take a basic numerical average
for all fiat currencies you get

6790
01:55:49,990 --> 01:55:50,000
for all fiat currencies you get
 

6791
01:55:50,000 --> 01:55:52,550
for all fiat currencies you get
something like 30 percent uh the average

6792
01:55:52,550 --> 01:55:52,560
something like 30 percent uh the average
 

6793
01:55:52,560 --> 01:55:54,870
something like 30 percent uh the average
fiat currency increases by 30

6794
01:55:54,870 --> 01:55:54,880
fiat currency increases by 30
 

6795
01:55:54,880 --> 01:55:56,870
fiat currency increases by 30
but if you value it by the volume of

6796
01:55:56,870 --> 01:55:56,880
but if you value it by the volume of
 

6797
01:55:56,880 --> 01:55:58,550
but if you value it by the volume of
each currency so that you know you're

6798
01:55:58,550 --> 01:55:58,560
each currency so that you know you're
 

6799
01:55:58,560 --> 01:56:00,390
each currency so that you know you're
not giving equal weight to the

6800
01:56:00,390 --> 01:56:00,400
not giving equal weight to the
 

6801
01:56:00,400 --> 01:56:02,149
not giving equal weight to the
venezuelan bolivar

6802
01:56:02,149 --> 01:56:02,159
venezuelan bolivar
 

6803
01:56:02,159 --> 01:56:03,109
venezuelan bolivar
uh

6804
01:56:03,109 --> 01:56:03,119
uh
 

6805
01:56:03,119 --> 01:56:05,030
uh
increasing at 500 percent a year and the

6806
01:56:05,030 --> 01:56:05,040
increasing at 500 percent a year and the
 

6807
01:56:05,040 --> 01:56:06,470
increasing at 500 percent a year and the
dollar increasing at eight percent a

6808
01:56:06,470 --> 01:56:06,480
dollar increasing at eight percent a
 

6809
01:56:06,480 --> 01:56:07,510
dollar increasing at eight percent a
year

6810
01:56:07,510 --> 01:56:07,520
year
 

6811
01:56:07,520 --> 01:56:09,669
year
um if you do it by value of the

6812
01:56:09,669 --> 01:56:09,679
um if you do it by value of the
 

6813
01:56:09,679 --> 01:56:11,350
um if you do it by value of the
currencies so that you get the total

6814
01:56:11,350 --> 01:56:11,360
currencies so that you get the total
 

6815
01:56:11,360 --> 01:56:12,870
currencies so that you get the total
supply fee and it's something like 14

6816
01:56:12,870 --> 01:56:12,880
supply fee and it's something like 14
 

6817
01:56:12,880 --> 01:56:14,950
supply fee and it's something like 14
percent so unweighted is thirty percent

6818
01:56:14,950 --> 01:56:14,960
percent so unweighted is thirty percent
 

6819
01:56:14,960 --> 01:56:17,270
percent so unweighted is thirty percent
you said yeah thirty percent it's insane

6820
01:56:17,270 --> 01:56:17,280
you said yeah thirty percent it's insane
 

6821
01:56:17,280 --> 01:56:19,430
you said yeah thirty percent it's insane
i'd like to see the worst ones the the

6822
01:56:19,430 --> 01:56:19,440
i'd like to see the worst ones the the
 

6823
01:56:19,440 --> 01:56:21,189
i'd like to see the worst ones the the
the people that are dragging the average

6824
01:56:21,189 --> 01:56:21,199
the people that are dragging the average
 

6825
01:56:21,199 --> 01:56:24,149
the people that are dragging the average
up uh yeah but fourteen percent is still

6826
01:56:24,149 --> 01:56:24,159
up uh yeah but fourteen percent is still
 

6827
01:56:24,159 --> 01:56:25,669
up uh yeah but fourteen percent is still
an incredibly high high number and so

6828
01:56:25,669 --> 01:56:25,679
an incredibly high high number and so
 

6829
01:56:25,679 --> 01:56:26,870
an incredibly high high number and so
you're saying that

6830
01:56:26,870 --> 01:56:26,880
you're saying that
 

6831
01:56:26,880 --> 01:56:28,550
you're saying that
that's sorry that's the average over the

6832
01:56:28,550 --> 01:56:28,560
that's sorry that's the average over the
 

6833
01:56:28,560 --> 01:56:30,390
that's sorry that's the average over the
century or the past over the past 60

6834
01:56:30,390 --> 01:56:30,400
century or the past over the past 60
 

6835
01:56:30,400 --> 01:56:32,950
century or the past over the past 60
years 1960s to 2020 we get world bank

6836
01:56:32,950 --> 01:56:32,960
years 1960s to 2020 we get world bank
 

6837
01:56:32,960 --> 01:56:35,030
years 1960s to 2020 we get world bank
data on that pretty reliable data on

6838
01:56:35,030 --> 01:56:35,040
data on that pretty reliable data on
 

6839
01:56:35,040 --> 01:56:38,470
data on that pretty reliable data on
world bank and european union oecd data

6840
01:56:38,470 --> 01:56:38,480
world bank and european union oecd data
 

6841
01:56:38,480 --> 01:56:40,149
world bank and european union oecd data
i ran the numbers on that weighted

6842
01:56:40,149 --> 01:56:40,159
i ran the numbers on that weighted
 

6843
01:56:40,159 --> 01:56:42,310
i ran the numbers on that weighted
average something like 14 and what

6844
01:56:42,310 --> 01:56:42,320
average something like 14 and what
 

6845
01:56:42,320 --> 01:56:43,750
average something like 14 and what
effect that has

6846
01:56:43,750 --> 01:56:43,760
effect that has
 

6847
01:56:43,760 --> 01:56:46,229
effect that has
on time preference the effect is now

6848
01:56:46,229 --> 01:56:46,239
on time preference the effect is now
 

6849
01:56:46,239 --> 01:56:48,470
on time preference the effect is now
it's much much much harder for everybody

6850
01:56:48,470 --> 01:56:48,480
it's much much much harder for everybody
 

6851
01:56:48,480 --> 01:56:50,310
it's much much much harder for everybody
to provide for their future everywhere

6852
01:56:50,310 --> 01:56:50,320
to provide for their future everywhere
 

6853
01:56:50,320 --> 01:56:53,030
to provide for their future everywhere
in the world it's much harder so how how

6854
01:56:53,030 --> 01:56:53,040
in the world it's much harder so how how
 

6855
01:56:53,040 --> 01:56:54,550
in the world it's much harder so how how
do i

6856
01:56:54,550 --> 01:56:54,560
do i
 

6857
01:56:54,560 --> 01:56:56,470
do i
get the equivalent of the old gold coin

6858
01:56:56,470 --> 01:56:56,480
get the equivalent of the old gold coin
 

6859
01:56:56,480 --> 01:56:57,910
get the equivalent of the old gold coin
that i could just put under my mattress

6860
01:56:57,910 --> 01:56:57,920
that i could just put under my mattress
 

6861
01:56:57,920 --> 01:56:59,430
that i could just put under my mattress
and expect it to be there 10 years from

6862
01:56:59,430 --> 01:56:59,440
and expect it to be there 10 years from
 

6863
01:56:59,440 --> 01:57:01,270
and expect it to be there 10 years from
now well gold itself isn't cutting it

6864
01:57:01,270 --> 01:57:01,280
now well gold itself isn't cutting it
 

6865
01:57:01,280 --> 01:57:03,350
now well gold itself isn't cutting it
gold can't keep up with inflation and

6866
01:57:03,350 --> 01:57:03,360
gold can't keep up with inflation and
 

6867
01:57:03,360 --> 01:57:05,189
gold can't keep up with inflation and
the reason for that is that gold is not

6868
01:57:05,189 --> 01:57:05,199
the reason for that is that gold is not
 

6869
01:57:05,199 --> 01:57:08,229
the reason for that is that gold is not
being used as a money anymore in that

6870
01:57:08,229 --> 01:57:08,239
being used as a money anymore in that
 

6871
01:57:08,239 --> 01:57:09,430
being used as a money anymore in that
you can't

6872
01:57:09,430 --> 01:57:09,440
you can't
 

6873
01:57:09,440 --> 01:57:10,950
you can't
send it

6874
01:57:10,950 --> 01:57:10,960
send it
 

6875
01:57:10,960 --> 01:57:13,109
send it
internationally you can't use it to

6876
01:57:13,109 --> 01:57:13,119
internationally you can't use it to
 

6877
01:57:13,119 --> 01:57:14,790
internationally you can't use it to
settle trade internationally which

6878
01:57:14,790 --> 01:57:14,800
settle trade internationally which
 

6879
01:57:14,800 --> 01:57:16,310
settle trade internationally which
therefore means

6880
01:57:16,310 --> 01:57:16,320
therefore means
 

6881
01:57:16,320 --> 01:57:18,709
therefore means
demand for it monetarily is limited and

6882
01:57:18,709 --> 01:57:18,719
demand for it monetarily is limited and
 

6883
01:57:18,719 --> 01:57:19,589
demand for it monetarily is limited and
so

6884
01:57:19,589 --> 01:57:19,599
so
 

6885
01:57:19,599 --> 01:57:21,910
so
it's um becoming more and more an

6886
01:57:21,910 --> 01:57:21,920
it's um becoming more and more an
 

6887
01:57:21,920 --> 01:57:25,350
it's um becoming more and more an
industrial metal and as a result

6888
01:57:25,350 --> 01:57:25,360
industrial metal and as a result
 

6889
01:57:25,360 --> 01:57:26,709
industrial metal and as a result
as a result of the fact that its value

6890
01:57:26,709 --> 01:57:26,719
as a result of the fact that its value
 

6891
01:57:26,719 --> 01:57:27,990
as a result of the fact that its value
doesn't keep up with inflation it

6892
01:57:27,990 --> 01:57:28,000
doesn't keep up with inflation it
 

6893
01:57:28,000 --> 01:57:29,990
doesn't keep up with inflation it
becomes economical to use it in industry

6894
01:57:29,990 --> 01:57:30,000
becomes economical to use it in industry
 

6895
01:57:30,000 --> 01:57:32,629
becomes economical to use it in industry
so we're seeing gold become like silver

6896
01:57:32,629 --> 01:57:32,639
so we're seeing gold become like silver
 

6897
01:57:32,639 --> 01:57:34,550
so we're seeing gold become like silver
in that it gets used in industry so the

6898
01:57:34,550 --> 01:57:34,560
in that it gets used in industry so the
 

6899
01:57:34,560 --> 01:57:36,790
in that it gets used in industry so the
stockpile declines and so the stock to

6900
01:57:36,790 --> 01:57:36,800
stockpile declines and so the stock to
 

6901
01:57:36,800 --> 01:57:38,709
stockpile declines and so the stock to
flow ratio declines as well and it

6902
01:57:38,709 --> 01:57:38,719
flow ratio declines as well and it
 

6903
01:57:38,719 --> 01:57:40,229
flow ratio declines as well and it
becomes more and more of an industrial

6904
01:57:40,229 --> 01:57:40,239
becomes more and more of an industrial
 

6905
01:57:40,239 --> 01:57:42,790
becomes more and more of an industrial
metal and it can't um protect your

6906
01:57:42,790 --> 01:57:42,800
metal and it can't um protect your
 

6907
01:57:42,800 --> 01:57:45,189
metal and it can't um protect your
wealth over time very well so what do

6908
01:57:45,189 --> 01:57:45,199
wealth over time very well so what do
 

6909
01:57:45,199 --> 01:57:47,589
wealth over time very well so what do
you do well you could invest and and

6910
01:57:47,589 --> 01:57:47,599
you do well you could invest and and
 

6911
01:57:47,599 --> 01:57:49,030
you do well you could invest and and
this is kind of the obvious answer that

6912
01:57:49,030 --> 01:57:49,040
this is kind of the obvious answer that
 

6913
01:57:49,040 --> 01:57:50,709
this is kind of the obvious answer that
keynesians will give you is well you

6914
01:57:50,709 --> 01:57:50,719
keynesians will give you is well you
 

6915
01:57:50,719 --> 01:57:53,109
keynesians will give you is well you
just put your money in an investment but

6916
01:57:53,109 --> 01:57:53,119
just put your money in an investment but
 

6917
01:57:53,119 --> 01:57:55,030
just put your money in an investment but
investment is different from saving

6918
01:57:55,030 --> 01:57:55,040
investment is different from saving
 

6919
01:57:55,040 --> 01:57:56,629
investment is different from saving
saving the whole point of saving is that

6920
01:57:56,629 --> 01:57:56,639
saving the whole point of saving is that
 

6921
01:57:56,639 --> 01:57:58,470
saving the whole point of saving is that
the thing is liquid and that the thing

6922
01:57:58,470 --> 01:57:58,480
the thing is liquid and that the thing
 

6923
01:57:58,480 --> 01:58:00,149
the thing is liquid and that the thing
carries little uncertainty you know you

6924
01:58:00,149 --> 01:58:00,159
carries little uncertainty you know you
 

6925
01:58:00,159 --> 01:58:02,310
carries little uncertainty you know you
just held the gold coin

6926
01:58:02,310 --> 01:58:02,320
just held the gold coin
 

6927
01:58:02,320 --> 01:58:04,390
just held the gold coin
and it just sat there it did nothing it

6928
01:58:04,390 --> 01:58:04,400
and it just sat there it did nothing it
 

6929
01:58:04,400 --> 01:58:05,750
and it just sat there it did nothing it
didn't take risk

6930
01:58:05,750 --> 01:58:05,760
didn't take risk
 

6931
01:58:05,760 --> 01:58:06,950
didn't take risk
you knew that it was going to be there

6932
01:58:06,950 --> 01:58:06,960
you knew that it was going to be there
 

6933
01:58:06,960 --> 01:58:09,430
you knew that it was going to be there
in 10 years investment means you give

6934
01:58:09,430 --> 01:58:09,440
in 10 years investment means you give
 

6935
01:58:09,440 --> 01:58:11,510
in 10 years investment means you give
the gold coin to somebody to go and do

6936
01:58:11,510 --> 01:58:11,520
the gold coin to somebody to go and do
 

6937
01:58:11,520 --> 01:58:12,790
the gold coin to somebody to go and do
something with it

6938
01:58:12,790 --> 01:58:12,800
something with it
 

6939
01:58:12,800 --> 01:58:14,470
something with it
and it could work it could not work if

6940
01:58:14,470 --> 01:58:14,480
and it could work it could not work if
 

6941
01:58:14,480 --> 01:58:16,470
and it could work it could not work if
it works you get a positive return you

6942
01:58:16,470 --> 01:58:16,480
it works you get a positive return you
 

6943
01:58:16,480 --> 01:58:19,109
it works you get a positive return you
get more gold back if it fails you might

6944
01:58:19,109 --> 01:58:19,119
get more gold back if it fails you might
 

6945
01:58:19,119 --> 01:58:21,109
get more gold back if it fails you might
not get any of your gold back

6946
01:58:21,109 --> 01:58:21,119
not get any of your gold back
 

6947
01:58:21,119 --> 01:58:23,510
not get any of your gold back
so taking on risk is something very

6948
01:58:23,510 --> 01:58:23,520
so taking on risk is something very
 

6949
01:58:23,520 --> 01:58:25,030
so taking on risk is something very
different from saving saving is just a

6950
01:58:25,030 --> 01:58:25,040
different from saving saving is just a
 

6951
01:58:25,040 --> 01:58:26,870
different from saving saving is just a
way of buying the future

6952
01:58:26,870 --> 01:58:26,880
way of buying the future
 

6953
01:58:26,880 --> 01:58:29,990
way of buying the future
investing is taking on a risk and you

6954
01:58:29,990 --> 01:58:30,000
investing is taking on a risk and you
 

6955
01:58:30,000 --> 01:58:32,149
investing is taking on a risk and you
could lose everything with it so

6956
01:58:32,149 --> 01:58:32,159
could lose everything with it so
 

6957
01:58:32,159 --> 01:58:33,750
could lose everything with it so
what ends up happening and and this is

6958
01:58:33,750 --> 01:58:33,760
what ends up happening and and this is
 

6959
01:58:33,760 --> 01:58:35,189
what ends up happening and and this is
uh you know the keynesian objection i

6960
01:58:35,189 --> 01:58:35,199
uh you know the keynesian objection i
 

6961
01:58:35,199 --> 01:58:37,910
uh you know the keynesian objection i
think is is is up is

01:58:37,910 --> 01:58:37,920
think is is is up is
 

6963
01:58:37,920 --> 01:58:41,189

you remember 18
 

6997
01:59:15,360 --> 01:59:17,030
you remember 18
yeah that 14

6998
01:59:17,030 --> 01:59:17,040
yeah that 14
 

6999
01:59:17,040 --> 01:59:18,950
yeah that 14
or even you know the seven percent like

7000
01:59:18,950 --> 01:59:18,960
or even you know the seven percent like
 

7001
01:59:18,960 --> 01:59:20,310
or even you know the seven percent like
if you look at just the increase in the

7002

if you look at just the increase in the
 

7003
01:59:20,320 --> 01:59:21,750
if you look at just the increase in the
money supply which i think is a much

7004

money supply which i think is a much
 

7005
01:59:21,760 --> 01:59:23,910
money supply which i think is a much
better metric and and this is what's

7006
01:59:23,910 --> 01:59:23,920
better metric and and this is what's

it means that the future becomes much
 

7175
02:02:04,800 --> 02:02:07,589
it means that the future becomes much
more uncertain so you're far less likely

7176
02:02:07,589 --> 02:02:07,599
more uncertain so you're far less likely
 

7177
02:02:07,599 --> 02:02:09,270
more uncertain so you're far less likely
to provide for yourself 10 years from

7178
02:02:09,270 --> 02:02:09,280
to provide for yourself 10 years from
 

7179
02:02:09,280 --> 02:02:10,950
to provide for yourself 10 years from
now i'm far less likely to find an easy

7180
02:02:10,950 --> 02:02:10,960
now i'm far less likely to find an easy
 

7181
02:02:10,960 --> 02:02:12,950
now i'm far less likely to find an easy
way to give yourself

7182
02:02:12,950 --> 02:02:12,960
way to give yourself
 

7183
02:02:12,960 --> 02:02:15,189
way to give yourself
value 10 years from now and so you

7184
02:02:15,189 --> 02:02:15,199
value 10 years from now and so you
 

7185
02:02:15,199 --> 02:02:17,350
value 10 years from now and so you
become more short-termist and that is

7186
02:02:17,350 --> 02:02:17,360
become more short-termist and that is
 

7187
02:02:17,360 --> 02:02:19,030
become more short-termist and that is
reflected economically in a lower

7188
02:02:19,030 --> 02:02:19,040
reflected economically in a lower
 

7189
02:02:19,040 --> 02:02:20,870
reflected economically in a lower
savings rate and we see savings rates

7190
02:02:20,870 --> 02:02:20,880
savings rate and we see savings rates
 

7191
02:02:20,880 --> 02:02:23,510
savings rate and we see savings rates
decline but it is also reflected in all

7192
02:02:23,510 --> 02:02:23,520
decline but it is also reflected in all
 

7193
02:02:23,520 --> 02:02:25,350
decline but it is also reflected in all
manners of decision-making and i think

7194
02:02:25,350 --> 02:02:25,360
manners of decision-making and i think
 

7195
02:02:25,360 --> 02:02:27,430
manners of decision-making and i think
if you really want to see what it is

7196
02:02:27,430 --> 02:02:27,440
if you really want to see what it is
 

7197
02:02:27,440 --> 02:02:29,109
if you really want to see what it is
take a look at a society that goes

7198
02:02:29,109 --> 02:02:29,119
take a look at a society that goes
 

7199
02:02:29,119 --> 02:02:31,350
take a look at a society that goes
through hyperinflation and look at what

7200
02:02:31,350 --> 02:02:31,360
through hyperinflation and look at what
 

7201
02:02:31,360 --> 02:02:33,750
through hyperinflation and look at what
happens there you know how do people

7202
02:02:33,750 --> 02:02:33,760
happens there you know how do people
 

7203
02:02:33,760 --> 02:02:34,629
happens there you know how do people
um

7204
02:02:34,629 --> 02:02:34,639

7205
02:02:34,639 --> 02:02:37,189

that to

is just slow motion hyperinflation so
 

7223
02:02:51,840 --> 02:02:53,270
is just slow motion hyperinflation so

caring less and less about the future
 

7271
02:03:39,679 --> 02:03:41,109

and we see it reflected in everything

7272
02:03:41,109 --> 02:03:41,119
and we see it reflected in everything
 

7273
02:03:41,119 --> 02:03:43,030

architecture you know we used to build

7276
02:03:44,390 --> 02:03:44,400
architecture you know we used to build
 

7277
02:03:44,400 --> 02:03:46,310
architecture you know we used to build
houses in the 19th century that last

7279
02:03:46,320 --> 02:03:48,550

7281
02:03:48,560 --> 02:03:50,629

we build essentially disposable

7286
02:03:54,310 --> 02:03:54,320
years
 

7287
02:03:54,320 --> 02:03:55,109
years
so

7288
02:03:55,109 --> 02:03:55,119
so
 

7289
02:03:55,119 --> 02:03:56,629
so
what can you say about potential

7290
02:03:56,629 --> 02:03:56,639
what can you say about potential
 

7291
02:03:56,639 --> 02:03:58,390
what can you say about potential
positive effects of lower time

7292
02:03:58,390 --> 02:03:58,400
positive effects of lower time
 

7293
02:03:58,400 --> 02:04:00,390
positive effects of lower time
preferences so i mean it's a balance

7294
02:04:00,390 --> 02:04:00,400
preferences so i mean it's a balance
 

7295
02:04:00,400 --> 02:04:01,830
preferences so i mean it's a balance
like uh you

7296
02:04:01,830 --> 02:04:01,840
like uh you
 

7297
02:04:01,840 --> 02:04:03,109
like uh you
basically

7298
02:04:03,109 --> 02:04:03,119
basically
 

7299
02:04:03,119 --> 02:04:04,950
basically
you're talking about an average kind of

7300
02:04:04,950 --> 02:04:04,960
you're talking about an average kind of
 

7301
02:04:04,960 --> 02:04:06,310
you're talking about an average kind of
time preference but you know there's

7302
02:04:06,310 --> 02:04:06,320
time preference but you know there's
 

7303
02:04:06,320 --> 02:04:08,149
time preference but you know there's
some things in life where

7304
02:04:08,149 --> 02:04:08,159
some things in life where
 

7305
02:04:08,159 --> 02:04:10,229
some things in life where
low time preference could be a negative

7306
02:04:10,229 --> 02:04:10,239
low time preference could be a negative
 

7307
02:04:10,239 --> 02:04:13,589
low time preference could be a negative
thing so like if i want to take on risk

7308
02:04:13,589 --> 02:04:13,599
thing so like if i want to take on risk
 

7309
02:04:13,599 --> 02:04:15,270
thing so like if i want to take on risk
not for investment put a kind of

7310
02:04:15,270 --> 02:04:15,280
not for investment put a kind of
 

7311
02:04:15,280 --> 02:04:16,790
not for investment put a kind of
investment but say i want to start a

7312
02:04:16,790 --> 02:04:16,800
investment but say i want to start a
 

7313
02:04:16,800 --> 02:04:17,910

business
i want to

7316
02:04:19,030 --> 02:04:19,040
i want to
 

7317
02:04:19,040 --> 02:04:21,350
i want to
take something crazy take a leap into

7318
02:04:21,350 --> 02:04:21,360
take something crazy take a leap into
 

7319
02:04:21,360 --> 02:04:24,149
take something crazy take a leap into
the unknown be an entrepreneur what can

7320
02:04:24,149 --> 02:04:24,159
the unknown be an entrepreneur what can
 

7321
02:04:24,159 --> 02:04:26,709
the unknown be an entrepreneur what can
you say about that kind of leap

7322
02:04:26,709 --> 02:04:26,719
you say about that kind of leap
 

7323
02:04:26,719 --> 02:04:28,790
you say about that kind of leap
taking on debt

7324
02:04:28,790 --> 02:04:28,800
taking on debt
 

7325
02:04:28,800 --> 02:04:30,470
taking on debt
what's the value of that within the

7326
02:04:30,470 --> 02:04:30,480
what's the value of that within the
 

7327
02:04:30,480 --> 02:04:32,550
what's the value of that within the
current system what's the right approach

7328
02:04:32,550 --> 02:04:32,560
current system what's the right approach
 

7329
02:04:32,560 --> 02:04:33,910
current system what's the right approach
to that within the current system what's

7330
02:04:33,910 --> 02:04:33,920
to that within the current system what's
 

7331
02:04:33,920 --> 02:04:35,589
to that within the current system what's
the right approach overall from an

the right approach overall from an
 

7333
02:04:35,599 --> 02:04:37,910
the right approach overall from an
economics perspective so not it's not

02:07:13,990 --> 02:07:14,000
use your own savings or somebody else's
 

7495
02:07:14,000 --> 02:07:15,750
use your own savings or somebody else's
savings so you didn't need to

7496
02:07:15,750 --> 02:07:15,760
savings so you didn't need to
 

7497
02:07:15,760 --> 02:07:17,910
savings so you didn't need to
get into debt uh

7498
02:07:17,910 --> 02:07:17,920
get into debt uh
 

7499
02:07:17,920 --> 02:07:19,830
get into debt uh
well you could get equity from others

7500
02:07:19,830 --> 02:07:19,840
well you could get equity from others
 

7501
02:07:19,840 --> 02:07:21,510
well you could get equity from others
and you could also get that from others

7502
02:07:21,510 --> 02:07:21,520
and you could also get that from others
 

7503
02:07:21,520 --> 02:07:24,069
and you could also get that from others
so there was but it's directly mapped to

7504
02:07:24,069 --> 02:07:24,079
so there was but it's directly mapped to
 

7505
02:07:24,079 --> 02:07:26,390
so there was but it's directly mapped to
physical reality yeah it's directly back

7506
02:07:26,390 --> 02:07:26,400
physical reality yeah it's directly back
 

7507
02:07:26,400 --> 02:07:27,910
physical reality yeah it's directly back
to economic reality and that there's a

7508
02:07:27,910 --> 02:07:27,920
to economic reality and that there's a
 

7509
02:07:27,920 --> 02:07:29,350
to economic reality and that there's a
hard money out there that you know what

7510
02:07:29,350 --> 02:07:29,360
hard money out there that you know what
 

7511
02:07:29,360 --> 02:07:31,030
hard money out there that you know what
you're spending money

7512
02:07:31,030 --> 02:07:31,040
you're spending money
 

7513
02:07:31,040 --> 02:07:32,790
you're spending money
you know you want to build your airplane

7514
02:07:32,790 --> 02:07:32,800
you know you want to build your airplane
 

7515
02:07:32,800 --> 02:07:33,830
you know you want to build your airplane
factory

7516
02:07:33,830 --> 02:07:33,840
factory
 

7517
02:07:33,840 --> 02:07:35,750
factory
you need to get actual resources so you

7518
02:07:35,750 --> 02:07:35,760
you need to get actual resources so you
 

7519
02:07:35,760 --> 02:07:37,750
you need to get actual resources so you
get actual gold either yours or somebody

7520
02:07:37,750 --> 02:07:37,760
get actual gold either yours or somebody
 

7521
02:07:37,760 --> 02:07:39,510
get actual gold either yours or somebody
else's you borrow it or you give them

7522
02:07:39,510 --> 02:07:39,520
else's you borrow it or you give them
 

7523
02:07:39,520 --> 02:07:42,149
else's you borrow it or you give them
equity but there's real resources now

7524
02:07:42,149 --> 02:07:42,159
equity but there's real resources now
 

7525
02:07:42,159 --> 02:07:43,669
equity but there's real resources now
what happened with the fiat system and

7526
02:07:43,669 --> 02:07:43,679
what happened with the fiat system and
 

7527
02:07:43,679 --> 02:07:45,270
what happened with the fiat system and
this is this is you know the first part

7528
02:07:45,270 --> 02:07:45,280
this is this is you know the first part
 

7529
02:07:45,280 --> 02:07:46,550
this is this is you know the first part
of the book where i look at it from an

7530
02:07:46,550 --> 02:07:46,560
of the book where i look at it from an
 

7531
02:07:46,560 --> 02:07:48,310
of the book where i look at it from an
engineering kind of perspective

7532
02:07:48,310 --> 02:07:48,320
engineering kind of perspective
 

7533
02:07:48,320 --> 02:07:50,149
engineering kind of perspective
is essentially and i think this is like

7534
02:07:50,149 --> 02:07:50,159
is essentially and i think this is like
 

7535
02:07:50,159 --> 02:07:52,229
is essentially and i think this is like
the breakthrough inside of the book

7536
02:07:52,229 --> 02:07:52,239
the breakthrough inside of the book
 

7537
02:07:52,239 --> 02:07:55,109
the breakthrough inside of the book
what fiat does is that it replaces gold

02:07:55,119 --> 02:07:56,229
what fiat does is that it replaces gold
mining

7540
02:07:56,229 --> 02:07:56,239
mining
 

7541
02:07:56,239 --> 02:07:59,350
mining
with credit creation

7542
02:07:59,350 --> 02:07:59,360
with credit creation
 

7543
02:07:59,360 --> 02:08:01,669
with credit creation
the way that we make fiat money the way

7544
02:08:01,669 --> 02:08:01,679
the way that we make fiat money the way
 

7545
02:08:01,679 --> 02:08:04,149
the way that we make fiat money the way
that fiat is mined into existence is

7546
02:08:04,149 --> 02:08:04,159
that fiat is mined into existence is
 

7547
02:08:04,159 --> 02:08:05,430
that fiat is mined into existence is
through credit creation most people

7548
02:08:05,430 --> 02:08:05,440
through credit creation most people
 

7549
02:08:05,440 --> 02:08:06,790
through credit creation most people
think of fiat money as being something

7550
02:08:06,790 --> 02:08:06,800
think of fiat money as being something
 

7551
02:08:06,800 --> 02:08:08,149
think of fiat money as being something
that happens when government prints

7552
02:08:08,149 --> 02:08:08,159
that happens when government prints
 

7553
02:08:08,159 --> 02:08:09,750
that happens when government prints
money and we still use the term

7554
02:08:09,750 --> 02:08:09,760
money and we still use the term
 

7555
02:08:09,760 --> 02:08:12,069
money and we still use the term
government's printing money but the vast

7556
02:08:12,069 --> 02:08:12,079
government's printing money but the vast
 

7557
02:08:12,079 --> 02:08:14,629
government's printing money but the vast
majority of fiat is not physical and in

7558
02:08:14,629 --> 02:08:14,639
majority of fiat is not physical and in
 

7559
02:08:14,639 --> 02:08:16,550
majority of fiat is not physical and in
fact fiat is not created when it is

7560
02:08:16,550 --> 02:08:16,560
fact fiat is not created when it is
 

7561
02:08:16,560 --> 02:08:18,870
fact fiat is not created when it is
printed physically it's created when it

7562
02:08:18,870 --> 02:08:18,880
printed physically it's created when it
 

7563
02:08:18,880 --> 02:08:21,669
printed physically it's created when it
is lent so when you go to a bank to get

7564
02:08:21,669 --> 02:08:21,679
is lent so when you go to a bank to get
 

7565
02:08:21,679 --> 02:08:24,069
is lent so when you go to a bank to get
a 1 million loan to buy a house

7566
02:08:24,069 --> 02:08:24,079
a 1 million loan to buy a house
 

7567
02:08:24,079 --> 02:08:25,669
a 1 million loan to buy a house
that bank is not going to give you a

7568
02:08:25,669 --> 02:08:25,679
that bank is not going to give you a
 

7569
02:08:25,679 --> 02:08:27,589
that bank is not going to give you a
million dollars from their own money or

7570
02:08:27,589 --> 02:08:27,599
million dollars from their own money or
 

7571
02:08:27,599 --> 02:08:29,510
million dollars from their own money or
from their depositors money they're

7572
02:08:29,510 --> 02:08:29,520
from their depositors money they're
 

7573
02:08:29,520 --> 02:08:31,109
from their depositors money they're
going to make a fresh new million

7574
02:08:31,109 --> 02:08:31,119
going to make a fresh new million
 

7575
02:08:31,119 --> 02:08:34,069
going to make a fresh new million
dollars when you walk out of that bank

7576
02:08:34,069 --> 02:08:34,079
dollars when you walk out of that bank

million dollars to finance your home
 

7581
02:08:38,560 --> 02:08:39,589
million dollars to finance your home
so

7582
02:08:39,589 --> 02:08:39,599
so
 

7583
02:08:39,599 --> 02:08:41,910
so
what fiat does is i mean it was

7584
02:08:41,910 --> 02:08:41,920
what fiat does is i mean it was
 

7585
02:08:41,920 --> 02:08:44,470
what fiat does is i mean it was
basically born out of government credit

7586
02:08:44,470 --> 02:08:44,480
basically born out of government credit
 

7587
02:08:44,480 --> 02:08:45,189
basically born out of government credit
and

7588
02:08:45,189 --> 02:08:45,199
and
 

7589
02:08:45,199 --> 02:08:46,870
and
the credit of banks that are backed by

7590
02:08:46,870 --> 02:08:46,880
the credit of banks that are backed by
 

7591
02:08:46,880 --> 02:08:48,870
the credit of banks that are backed by
the central bank and the government

7592
02:08:48,870 --> 02:08:48,880
the central bank and the government
 

7593
02:08:48,880 --> 02:08:51,109
the central bank and the government
so if you're part of the institutions

7594
02:08:51,109 --> 02:08:51,119
so if you're part of the institutions
 

7595
02:08:51,119 --> 02:08:52,310
so if you're part of the institutions
that are allowed

7596
02:08:52,310 --> 02:08:52,320
that are allowed
 

7597
02:08:52,320 --> 02:08:54,470
that are allowed

02:08:56,639 --> 02:08:58,790
loans backed by the central bank backed
by the currency you are effectively

7602
02:08:58,790 --> 02:08:58,800
by the currency you are effectively
 

7603
02:08:58,800 --> 02:09:00,709
by the currency you are effectively
creating new currency new money every

7604
02:09:00,709 --> 02:09:00,719

mining is credit creation i love it so

7608
02:09:05,830 --> 02:09:05,840
mining is credit creation i love it so
 

7609
02:09:05,840 --> 02:09:07,990
mining is credit creation i love it so
can you say something i mean you can't

7610
02:09:07,990 --> 02:09:08,000
can you say something i mean you can't
 

7611
02:09:08,000 --> 02:09:09,910
can you say something i mean you can't
really have credit without a demand for

7612
02:09:09,910 --> 02:09:09,920
really have credit without a demand for
 

7613
02:09:09,920 --> 02:09:11,830
really have credit without a demand for
credit you can't really have an increase

7614
02:09:11,830 --> 02:09:11,840
credit you can't really have an increase
 

7615
02:09:11,840 --> 02:09:14,149
credit you can't really have an increase
in supply without a demand for it is

02:09:14,149 --> 02:09:14,159
in supply without a demand for it is
 

7617
02:09:14,159 --> 02:09:16,470
in supply without a demand for it is
there any value you place

7618
02:09:16,470 --> 02:09:16,480
there any value you place
 

7619
02:09:16,480 --> 02:09:18,790
there any value you place
in like the humans wanting it

7620
02:09:18,790 --> 02:09:18,800
in like the humans wanting it
 

7621
02:09:18,800 --> 02:09:20,310
in like the humans wanting it
basically

7622
02:09:20,310 --> 02:09:20,320
basically
 

7623
02:09:20,320 --> 02:09:22,229
basically
people wanting to do something with that

7624
02:09:22,229 --> 02:09:22,239
people wanting to do something with that
 

7625
02:09:22,239 --> 02:09:24,310
people wanting to do something with that
credit wanting to take big leaps big

7626
02:09:24,310 --> 02:09:24,320
credit wanting to take big leaps big
 

7627
02:09:24,320 --> 02:09:27,830
credit wanting to take big leaps big
risks big entrepreneurial decisions

7628
02:09:27,830 --> 02:09:27,840
risks big entrepreneurial decisions
 

7629
02:09:27,840 --> 02:09:31,109
risks big entrepreneurial decisions
so is it all bad is all credit bad

7630
02:09:31,109 --> 02:09:31,119
so is it all bad is all credit bad
 

7631
02:09:31,119 --> 02:09:34,470
so is it all bad is all credit bad
no i think what's bad is uh you know

7632
02:09:34,470 --> 02:09:34,480
no i think what's bad is uh you know
 

7633
02:09:34,480 --> 02:09:36,790
no i think what's bad is uh you know
anything in in my opinion anything that

anything in in my opinion anything that
is consensual you know i want to borrow

7636
02:09:38,870 --> 02:09:38,880
is consensual you know i want to borrow
 

7637
02:09:38,880 --> 02:09:40,629
is consensual you know i want to borrow
money from you and we agree the terms i

i can't object to that but
 

7645
02:09:46,800 --> 02:09:49,030
i can't object to that but
in the case of the fiat system it's not

7646
02:09:49,030 --> 02:09:49,040
in the case of the fiat system it's not
 

7647
02:09:49,040 --> 02:09:50,470
in the case of the fiat system it's not
just you and the bank who come to an

everybody who uses the currency is
 

7653
02:09:54,000 --> 02:09:55,669
everybody who uses the currency is
forced to be part of that agreement

7654

forced to be part of that agreement
 

7655
02:09:55,679 --> 02:09:57,189
forced to be part of that agreement
because if you default

7656
02:09:57,189 --> 02:09:57,199
because if you default
 

7657
02:09:57,199 --> 02:09:59,189
because if you default
you know effectively what's protecting

7658
02:09:59,189 --> 02:09:59,199
you know effectively what's protecting
 

7659
02:09:59,199 --> 02:10:01,270
you know effectively what's protecting
the bank from you is the fact that the

the bank from you is the fact that the
government can just print a bunch of

government can just print a bunch of
 

7663
02:10:02,639 --> 02:10:05,669
government can just print a bunch of
money and make the bank hold so

7664
02:10:05,669 --> 02:10:05,679
money and make the bank hold so
 

7665
02:10:05,679 --> 02:10:08,470
money and make the bank hold so
effectively interesting so like that

7666
02:10:08,470 --> 02:10:08,480
effectively interesting so like that
 

7667
02:10:08,480 --> 02:10:10,310
effectively interesting so like that
little agreement between

7668
02:10:10,310 --> 02:10:10,320
little agreement between
 

7669
02:10:10,320 --> 02:10:12,550

agreement between the bank you and the
 

7673
02:10:14,480 --> 02:10:15,830
agreement between the bank you and the
entire populace that's using the

entire populace that's using the
 

7675
02:10:15,840 --> 02:10:17,910
entire populace that's using the
currency exactly they're forced to

7676
02:10:17,910 --> 02:10:17,920

net is the valuation of the currency
 

7683
02:10:24,000 --> 02:10:25,669
net is the valuation of the currency
that's how it uh

7684

money for me so obviously they can cut
me in on that deal and that's why it's

7810
02:12:24,229 --> 02:12:24,239
me in on that deal and that's why it's
 

7811
02:12:24,239 --> 02:12:25,990
me in on that deal and that's why it's
much cheaper for everybody to buy with

7812
02:12:25,990 --> 02:12:26,000
much cheaper for everybody to buy with
 

7813
02:12:26,000 --> 02:12:27,430
much cheaper for everybody to buy with
credit that's why everybody buys

7814
02:12:27,430 --> 02:12:27,440
credit that's why everybody buys
 

7815
02:12:27,440 --> 02:12:29,750
credit that's why everybody buys
everything on credit so when we look at

7816
02:12:29,750 --> 02:12:29,760
everything on credit so when we look at
 

7817
02:12:29,760 --> 02:12:31,910
everything on credit so when we look at
the global monetary system the thing you

7818
02:12:31,910 --> 02:12:31,920
the global monetary system the thing you
 

7819
02:12:31,920 --> 02:12:35,430
the global monetary system the thing you
want to do as a government is be the

7820
02:12:35,430 --> 02:12:35,440
want to do as a government is be the
 

7821
02:12:35,440 --> 02:12:39,910
want to do as a government is be the
sexiest currency out there so the the

7822
02:12:39,910 --> 02:12:39,920
sexiest currency out there so the the
 

7823
02:12:39,920 --> 02:12:41,589
sexiest currency out there so the the
the main currency like the dollar

7824
02:12:41,589 --> 02:12:41,599
the main currency like the dollar
 

7825
02:12:41,599 --> 02:12:43,430
the main currency like the dollar
currently is is the one that has the

7826
02:12:43,430 --> 02:12:43,440
currently is is the one that has the
 

7827
02:12:43,440 --> 02:12:45,510
currently is is the one that has the
most power in that in that kind of

7828
02:12:45,510 --> 02:12:45,520
most power in that in that kind of
 

7829
02:12:45,520 --> 02:12:47,990
most power in that in that kind of
context so you have if you if you were

7830
02:12:47,990 --> 02:12:48,000
context so you have if you if you were
 

7831
02:12:48,000 --> 02:12:49,750
context so you have if you if you were
to try to summarize what is the global

7832
02:12:49,750 --> 02:12:49,760
to try to summarize what is the global
 

7833
02:12:49,760 --> 02:12:52,950
to try to summarize what is the global
monetary system it is as as it is today

7834
02:12:52,950 --> 02:12:52,960
monetary system it is as as it is today
 

7835
02:12:52,960 --> 02:12:55,510
monetary system it is as as it is today
is a bunch of fiat currencies

7836
02:12:55,510 --> 02:12:55,520
is a bunch of fiat currencies
 

7837
02:12:55,520 --> 02:12:57,830
is a bunch of fiat currencies
battling for position

7838
02:12:57,830 --> 02:12:57,840
battling for position
 

7839
02:12:57,840 --> 02:12:59,350
battling for position
for um

7840
02:12:59,350 --> 02:12:59,360
for um
 

7841
02:12:59,360 --> 02:13:01,109
for um
for use

7842
02:13:01,109 --> 02:13:01,119
for use
 

7843
02:13:01,119 --> 02:13:03,030
for use
outside their nation

7844
02:13:03,030 --> 02:13:03,040
outside their nation
 

7845
02:13:03,040 --> 02:13:05,350
outside their nation
and in so doing trying to gain power in

7846
02:13:05,350 --> 02:13:05,360
and in so doing trying to gain power in
 

7847
02:13:05,360 --> 02:13:07,270
and in so doing trying to gain power in
the geopolitical sense is that if we

7848
02:13:07,270 --> 02:13:07,280
the geopolitical sense is that if we
 

7849
02:13:07,280 --> 02:13:09,270
the geopolitical sense is that if we
just zoom out

7850
02:13:09,270 --> 02:13:09,280
just zoom out
 

7851
02:13:09,280 --> 02:13:11,189
just zoom out
what is the global monetary system like

7852
02:13:11,189 --> 02:13:11,199
what is the global monetary system like
 

7853
02:13:11,199 --> 02:13:14,069
what is the global monetary system like
how what is what is it currently uh so

7854
02:13:14,069 --> 02:13:14,079
how what is what is it currently uh so
 

7855
02:13:14,079 --> 02:13:15,350
how what is what is it currently uh so
outside the united states the whole

7856
02:13:15,350 --> 02:13:15,360
outside the united states the whole
 

7857
02:13:15,360 --> 02:13:17,350
outside the united states the whole
thing yeah you could say that but i

7858
02:13:17,350 --> 02:13:17,360
thing yeah you could say that but i
 

7859
02:13:17,360 --> 02:13:18,950
thing yeah you could say that but i
think it's more realistic looking at how

7860
02:13:18,950 --> 02:13:18,960
think it's more realistic looking at how
 

7861
02:13:18,960 --> 02:13:20,229
think it's more realistic looking at how
it has actually evolved over the past

7862
02:13:20,229 --> 02:13:20,239
it has actually evolved over the past
 

7863
02:13:20,239 --> 02:13:21,510
it has actually evolved over the past
few decades

7864
02:13:21,510 --> 02:13:21,520
few decades
 

7865
02:13:21,520 --> 02:13:23,510
few decades
it's really a dollar system it's not a

7866
02:13:23,510 --> 02:13:23,520
it's really a dollar system it's not a
 

7867
02:13:23,520 --> 02:13:25,350
it's really a dollar system it's not a
system of currencies if

7868
02:13:25,350 --> 02:13:25,360
system of currencies if
 

7869
02:13:25,360 --> 02:13:26,870
system of currencies if
buying with one another it's a dollar

7870
02:13:26,870 --> 02:13:26,880
buying with one another it's a dollar
 

7871
02:13:26,880 --> 02:13:28,629
buying with one another it's a dollar
system and all other currencies are just

7872
02:13:28,629 --> 02:13:28,639
system and all other currencies are just
 

7873
02:13:28,639 --> 02:13:30,390
system and all other currencies are just
basically i like to call them dollar

7874
02:13:30,390 --> 02:13:30,400
basically i like to call them dollar
 

7875
02:13:30,400 --> 02:13:31,990
basically i like to call them dollar
plus country risk

7876
02:13:31,990 --> 02:13:32,000
plus country risk
 

7877
02:13:32,000 --> 02:13:34,149
plus country risk
so

7878
02:13:34,149 --> 02:13:34,159
so
 

7879
02:13:34,159 --> 02:13:36,310
so
it always returns home to the dollar

7880
02:13:36,310 --> 02:13:36,320
it always returns home to the dollar
 

7881
02:13:36,320 --> 02:13:38,310
it always returns home to the dollar
yeah there is no competition there is no

7882
02:13:38,310 --> 02:13:38,320
yeah there is no competition there is no
 

7883
02:13:38,320 --> 02:13:40,790
yeah there is no competition there is no
second best as michael saylor would say

7884
02:13:40,790 --> 02:13:40,800
second best as michael saylor would say
 

7885
02:13:40,800 --> 02:13:43,109
second best as michael saylor would say
um and money is like that you know gold

7886
02:13:43,109 --> 02:13:43,119
um and money is like that you know gold
 

7887
02:13:43,119 --> 02:13:45,109
um and money is like that you know gold
was a winner take all by the end of the

7888
02:13:45,109 --> 02:13:45,119
was a winner take all by the end of the
 

7889
02:13:45,119 --> 02:13:47,910
was a winner take all by the end of the
19th century the global monetary market

7890
02:13:47,910 --> 02:13:47,920
19th century the global monetary market
 

7891
02:13:47,920 --> 02:13:50,310
19th century the global monetary market
is effectively a winner take all for the

7892
02:13:50,310 --> 02:13:50,320
is effectively a winner take all for the
 

7893
02:13:50,320 --> 02:13:51,430
is effectively a winner take all for the
dollar

7894
02:13:51,430 --> 02:13:51,440
dollar
 

7895
02:13:51,440 --> 02:13:53,750
dollar
and if we get it to bitcoin

7896
02:13:53,750 --> 02:13:53,760
and if we get it to bitcoin
 

7897
02:13:53,760 --> 02:13:55,750
and if we get it to bitcoin
you'll know i also think

7898
02:13:55,750 --> 02:13:55,760
you'll know i also think
 

7899
02:13:55,760 --> 02:13:57,189
you'll know i also think
digital currencies are also going to be

7900
02:13:57,189 --> 02:13:57,199
digital currencies are also going to be
 

7901
02:13:57,199 --> 02:13:59,189
digital currencies are also going to be
a winner-take-all situation

7902
02:13:59,189 --> 02:13:59,199
a winner-take-all situation
 

7903
02:13:59,199 --> 02:14:00,470
a winner-take-all situation
so um

7904
02:14:00,470 --> 02:14:00,480
so um
 

7905
02:14:00,480 --> 02:14:02,310
so um
money wants to be won in fact there is

7906
02:14:02,310 --> 02:14:02,320
money wants to be won in fact there is
 

7907
02:14:02,320 --> 02:14:03,990
money wants to be won in fact there is
no such thing as multiple currencies

7908
02:14:03,990 --> 02:14:04,000
no such thing as multiple currencies
 

7909
02:14:04,000 --> 02:14:06,069
no such thing as multiple currencies
multiple currencies is just a step back

7910
02:14:06,069 --> 02:14:06,079
multiple currencies is just a step back
 

7911
02:14:06,079 --> 02:14:08,310
multiple currencies is just a step back
to barter money is

7912
02:14:08,310 --> 02:14:08,320
to barter money is
 

7913
02:14:08,320 --> 02:14:09,830
to barter money is
one if you go back to a system of

7914
02:14:09,830 --> 02:14:09,840
one if you go back to a system of
 

7915
02:14:09,840 --> 02:14:11,510
one if you go back to a system of
several currencies you're just

7916
02:14:11,510 --> 02:14:11,520
several currencies you're just
 

7917
02:14:11,520 --> 02:14:14,950
several currencies you're just
reinventing barter so um in in the case

7918
02:14:14,950 --> 02:14:14,960
reinventing barter so um in in the case
 

7919
02:14:14,960 --> 02:14:16,550
reinventing barter so um in in the case
of the dollar system you know the the

7920
02:14:16,550 --> 02:14:16,560
of the dollar system you know the the
 

7921
02:14:16,560 --> 02:14:19,189
of the dollar system you know the the
global dollar system is built around the

7922
02:14:19,189 --> 02:14:19,199
global dollar system is built around the
 

7923
02:14:19,199 --> 02:14:20,629
global dollar system is built around the
dollar

7924
02:14:20,629 --> 02:14:20,639
dollar
 

7925
02:14:20,639 --> 02:14:22,310
dollar
because all central banks have dollar

7926
02:14:22,310 --> 02:14:22,320
because all central banks have dollar
 

7927
02:14:22,320 --> 02:14:24,470
because all central banks have dollar
reserves and because all central banks

7928
02:14:24,470 --> 02:14:24,480
reserves and because all central banks
 

7929
02:14:24,480 --> 02:14:26,950
reserves and because all central banks
use the dollars clearing mechanisms so

7930
02:14:26,950 --> 02:14:26,960
use the dollars clearing mechanisms so
 

7931
02:14:26,960 --> 02:14:28,870
use the dollars clearing mechanisms so
that's why you're basically playing in

7932
02:14:28,870 --> 02:14:28,880
that's why you're basically playing in
 

7933
02:14:28,880 --> 02:14:30,310
that's why you're basically playing in
the dollar system

7934
02:14:30,310 --> 02:14:30,320
the dollar system
 

7935
02:14:30,320 --> 02:14:32,069
the dollar system
this seems to have changed over the last

7936
02:14:32,069 --> 02:14:32,079
this seems to have changed over the last
 

7937
02:14:32,079 --> 02:14:33,510
this seems to have changed over the last
couple of months

7938
02:14:33,510 --> 02:14:33,520
couple of months
 

7939
02:14:33,520 --> 02:14:35,589
couple of months
with the sanctions on russia and the

7940
02:14:35,589 --> 02:14:35,599
with the sanctions on russia and the
 

7941
02:14:35,599 --> 02:14:37,669
with the sanctions on russia and the
confiscation of russian reserves

7942
02:14:37,669 --> 02:14:37,679
confiscation of russian reserves
 

7943
02:14:37,679 --> 02:14:40,069
confiscation of russian reserves
it remains to be seen uh what that's

7944
02:14:40,069 --> 02:14:40,079
it remains to be seen uh what that's
 

7945
02:14:40,079 --> 02:14:41,910
it remains to be seen uh what that's
going to do and how that's going to

7946
02:14:41,910 --> 02:14:41,920
going to do and how that's going to
 

7947
02:14:41,920 --> 02:14:43,830
going to do and how that's going to
change but um

7948
02:14:43,830 --> 02:14:43,840
change but um
 

7949
02:14:43,840 --> 02:14:46,470
change but um
it is looking like you know the the this

7950
02:14:46,470 --> 02:14:46,480
it is looking like you know the the this
 

7951
02:14:46,480 --> 02:14:48,629
it is looking like you know the the this
dollar system is clearly unsustainable

7952
02:14:48,629 --> 02:14:48,639
dollar system is clearly unsustainable
 

7953
02:14:48,639 --> 02:14:49,830
dollar system is clearly unsustainable
it's not sustainable for the u.s it's

7954
02:14:49,830 --> 02:14:49,840
it's not sustainable for the u.s it's
 

7955
02:14:49,840 --> 02:14:51,830
it's not sustainable for the u.s it's
not sustainable for anybody

7956
02:14:51,830 --> 02:14:51,840
not sustainable for anybody
 

7957
02:14:51,840 --> 02:14:54,790
not sustainable for anybody
speaking of which so you

8025
02:16:04,639 --> 02:16:06,629
situation
what are the fundamentals of it what is

8026
02:16:06,629 --> 02:16:06,639
what are the fundamentals of it what is
 

8027
02:16:06,639 --> 02:16:08,390
what are the fundamentals of it what is
swift what are the possible future

8028
02:16:08,390 --> 02:16:08,400
swift what are the possible future
 

8029
02:16:08,400 --> 02:16:11,109
swift what are the possible future
evolutions of the global monetary system

8030
02:16:11,109 --> 02:16:11,119
evolutions of the global monetary system
 

8031
02:16:11,119 --> 02:16:12,550
evolutions of the global monetary system
yeah so swift is the network that the

8032
02:16:12,550 --> 02:16:12,560
yeah so swift is the network that the
 

8033
02:16:12,560 --> 02:16:15,990
yeah so swift is the network that the
u.s federal reserve uses for moving

8034
02:16:15,990 --> 02:16:16,000
u.s federal reserve uses for moving

8037
02:16:17,840 --> 02:16:19,430
money around the world
so basically the us government can

8038
02:16:19,430 --> 02:16:19,440
so basically the us government can
 

8039
02:16:19,440 --> 02:16:21,350
so basically the us government can
sanction you off of swift as they've

8040
02:16:21,350 --> 02:16:21,360
sanction you off of swift as they've
 

8041
02:16:21,360 --> 02:16:23,189
sanction you off of swift as they've
done with russian banks as they've done

8042
02:16:23,189 --> 02:16:23,199
done with russian banks as they've done
 

8043
02:16:23,199 --> 02:16:24,470
done with russian banks as they've done
with iran

8044
02:16:24,470 --> 02:16:24,480
with iran
 

8045
02:16:24,480 --> 02:16:27,189
with iran
and as they've done with afghanistan

8046
02:16:27,189 --> 02:16:27,199
and as they've done with afghanistan
 

8047
02:16:27,199 --> 02:16:28,310
and as they've done with afghanistan
so

8048
02:16:28,310 --> 02:16:28,320
so
 

8049
02:16:28,320 --> 02:16:30,229
so
effectively i mean this is really the

8050
02:16:30,229 --> 02:16:30,239
effectively i mean this is really the
 

8051
02:16:30,239 --> 02:16:31,669
effectively i mean this is really the
catastrophe of the current monetary

8052
02:16:31,669 --> 02:16:31,679
catastrophe of the current monetary
 

8053
02:16:31,679 --> 02:16:33,349
catastrophe of the current monetary
system is that in order to be able to

that they would let them operate and

8066
02:16:44,150 --> 02:16:44,160
that they would let them operate and
 

8067
02:16:44,160 --> 02:16:45,429
that they would let them operate and
this is really

8068
02:16:45,429 --> 02:16:45,439
this is really
 

8069
02:16:45,439 --> 02:16:48,629
this is really
like on top of the uh aspect of the

8070
02:16:48,629 --> 02:16:48,639
like on top of the uh aspect of the
 

8071
02:16:48,639 --> 02:16:50,709
like on top of the uh aspect of the
hardness of money this is the other

8072
02:16:50,709 --> 02:16:50,719
hardness of money this is the other
 

8073
02:16:50,719 --> 02:16:52,709
hardness of money this is the other
really powerful thing about bitcoin

8074
02:16:52,709 --> 02:16:52,719
really powerful thing about bitcoin
 

8075
02:16:52,719 --> 02:16:53,990
really powerful thing about bitcoin
which is that it's just purely a

8076
02:16:53,990 --> 02:16:54,000
which is that it's just purely a
 

8077
02:16:54,000 --> 02:16:56,070
which is that it's just purely a
technological thing it doesn't matter if

8078
02:16:56,070 --> 02:16:56,080
technological thing it doesn't matter if
 

8079
02:16:56,080 --> 02:16:57,589
technological thing it doesn't matter if
you're russian if you're iranian if

8080
02:16:57,589 --> 02:16:57,599
you're russian if you're iranian if
 

8081
02:16:57,599 --> 02:16:59,509
you're russian if you're iranian if
you're american if you're chinese it's a

8082
02:16:59,509 --> 02:16:59,519
you're american if you're chinese it's a
 

8083
02:16:59,519 --> 02:17:01,830
you're american if you're chinese it's a
technology and so it's like a spoon or a

8084
02:17:01,830 --> 02:17:01,840
technology and so it's like a spoon or a
 

8085
02:17:01,840 --> 02:17:04,950
technology and so it's like a spoon or a
knife or a car you know you you operate

8086
02:17:04,950 --> 02:17:04,960
knife or a car you know you you operate
 

8087
02:17:04,960 --> 02:17:06,389
knife or a car you know you you operate
it properly and it works and so with

8088
02:17:06,389 --> 02:17:06,399
it properly and it works and so with
 

8089
02:17:06,399 --> 02:17:07,830
it properly and it works and so with
bitcoin it's the same thing it doesn't

8090
02:17:07,830 --> 02:17:07,840
bitcoin it's the same thing it doesn't
 

8091
02:17:07,840 --> 02:17:09,830
bitcoin it's the same thing it doesn't
care about your passport if you have the

8092
02:17:09,830 --> 02:17:09,840
care about your passport if you have the
 

8093
02:17:09,840 --> 02:17:12,389
care about your passport if you have the
private key you click send and the money

8094
02:17:12,389 --> 02:17:12,399
private key you click send and the money
 

8095
02:17:12,399 --> 02:17:15,589
private key you click send and the money
goes uh well it doesn't really go but

8096
02:17:15,589 --> 02:17:15,599
goes uh well it doesn't really go but
 

8097
02:17:15,599 --> 02:17:17,190
goes uh well it doesn't really go but
effectively it does go

8098
02:17:17,190 --> 02:17:17,200
effectively it does go
 

8099
02:17:17,200 --> 02:17:19,349
effectively it does go
anywhere once and the money can move

8100
02:17:19,349 --> 02:17:19,359
anywhere once and the money can move
 

8101
02:17:19,359 --> 02:17:21,830
anywhere once and the money can move
without having to abide by political

8102
02:17:21,830 --> 02:17:21,840
without having to abide by political
 

8103
02:17:21,840 --> 02:17:23,910
without having to abide by political
situations and the point here is not to

8104
02:17:23,910 --> 02:17:23,920
situations and the point here is not to
 

8105
02:17:23,920 --> 02:17:26,070
situations and the point here is not to
bash u.s foreign policy

8106
02:17:26,070 --> 02:17:26,080
bash u.s foreign policy
 

8107
02:17:26,080 --> 02:17:27,750
bash u.s foreign policy
much as that might be deserved i'm just

8108
02:17:27,750 --> 02:17:27,760
much as that might be deserved i'm just
 

8109
02:17:27,760 --> 02:17:29,669
much as that might be deserved i'm just
going to discuss it from a kind of a

8110
02:17:29,669 --> 02:17:29,679
going to discuss it from a kind of a
 

8111
02:17:29,679 --> 02:17:31,669
going to discuss it from a kind of a
technical perspective it has to be a

8112
02:17:31,669 --> 02:17:31,679
technical perspective it has to be a
 

8113
02:17:31,679 --> 02:17:33,349
technical perspective it has to be a
political system with fiat because

8114
02:17:33,349 --> 02:17:33,359
political system with fiat because
 

8115
02:17:33,359 --> 02:17:35,669
political system with fiat because
ultimately it relies on credit and then

8116
02:17:35,669 --> 02:17:35,679
ultimately it relies on credit and then
 

8117
02:17:35,679 --> 02:17:37,030
ultimately it relies on credit and then
the government is the one that has the

8118
02:17:37,030 --> 02:17:37,040
the government is the one that has the
 

8119
02:17:37,040 --> 02:17:38,230
the government is the one that has the
guns and the government is going to

decide who gets to pay their loans
 

8123
02:17:40,080 --> 02:17:43,589
decide who gets to pay their loans
anyway in the government's uh going to

02:17:46,800 --> 02:17:48,870
make its own rules about who gets to
play and who doesn't and so it has to be

8130
02:17:48,870 --> 02:17:48,880
play and who doesn't and so it has to be
 

8131
02:17:48,880 --> 02:17:52,150
play and who doesn't and so it has to be
political as this kind of fiat system

8132
02:17:52,150 --> 02:17:52,160
political as this kind of fiat system
 

8133
02:17:52,160 --> 02:17:53,990
political as this kind of fiat system
and um

8134
02:17:53,990 --> 02:17:54,000
and um
 

8135
02:17:54,000 --> 02:17:54,790
and um
you know

8136
02:17:54,790 --> 02:17:54,800
you know
 

8137
02:17:54,800 --> 02:17:56,230
you know
when i wrote the bitcoin standard

8138
02:17:56,230 --> 02:17:56,240
when i wrote the bitcoin standard
 

8139
02:17:56,240 --> 02:17:57,990
when i wrote the bitcoin standard
initially i used to be much more of a

8140
02:17:57,990 --> 02:17:58,000
initially i used to be much more of a
 

8141
02:17:58,000 --> 02:18:00,389
initially i used to be much more of a
gold bug and in my mind you know

8142
02:18:00,389 --> 02:18:00,399
gold bug and in my mind you know
 

8143
02:18:00,399 --> 02:18:02,549
gold bug and in my mind you know
um goldbugs have spent the last 50 years

8144
02:18:02,549 --> 02:18:02,559
um goldbugs have spent the last 50 years
 

8145
02:18:02,559 --> 02:18:04,389
um goldbugs have spent the last 50 years
saying the global monetary system is

8146
02:18:04,389 --> 02:18:04,399
saying the global monetary system is
 

8147
02:18:04,399 --> 02:18:05,669
saying the global monetary system is
going to collapse next week and we're

8148
02:18:05,669 --> 02:18:05,679
going to collapse next week and we're
 

8149
02:18:05,679 --> 02:18:07,589
going to collapse next week and we're
going to go back to a gold standard

8150
02:18:07,589 --> 02:18:07,599
going to go back to a gold standard
 

8151
02:18:07,599 --> 02:18:09,190
going to go back to a gold standard
and writing the fiat system fiat

8152
02:18:09,190 --> 02:18:09,200
and writing the fiat system fiat
 

8153
02:18:09,200 --> 02:18:11,190
and writing the fiat system fiat
standard gave me a very good

8154
02:18:11,190 --> 02:18:11,200
standard gave me a very good
 

8155
02:18:11,200 --> 02:18:12,629
standard gave me a very good
appreciation for why this hasn't

8156
02:18:12,629 --> 02:18:12,639
appreciation for why this hasn't
 

8157
02:18:12,639 --> 02:18:15,270
appreciation for why this hasn't
happened and why it's not very likely to

8158
02:18:15,270 --> 02:18:15,280
happened and why it's not very likely to
 

8159
02:18:15,280 --> 02:18:17,589
happened and why it's not very likely to
happen i think the reason is

8160
02:18:17,589 --> 02:18:17,599
happen i think the reason is
 

8161
02:18:17,599 --> 02:18:19,429
happen i think the reason is
as i said earlier it's just gold is very

8162
02:18:19,429 --> 02:18:19,439
as i said earlier it's just gold is very
 

8163
02:18:19,439 --> 02:18:21,190
as i said earlier it's just gold is very
expensive to move around and perhaps

8164
02:18:21,190 --> 02:18:21,200
expensive to move around and perhaps
 

8165
02:18:21,200 --> 02:18:23,270
expensive to move around and perhaps
more importantly it's very expensive to

8166
02:18:23,270 --> 02:18:23,280
more importantly it's very expensive to
 

8167
02:18:23,280 --> 02:18:25,349
more importantly it's very expensive to
verify that's really the problem with it

8168
02:18:25,349 --> 02:18:25,359
verify that's really the problem with it
 

8169
02:18:25,359 --> 02:18:27,270
verify that's really the problem with it
it's very expensive to verify that the

8170
02:18:27,270 --> 02:18:27,280
it's very expensive to verify that the
 

8171
02:18:27,280 --> 02:18:28,870
it's very expensive to verify that the
gold that you're receiving is original

8172
02:18:28,870 --> 02:18:28,880
gold that you're receiving is original
 

8173
02:18:28,880 --> 02:18:32,389
gold that you're receiving is original
gold so the only way to do this properly

8174
02:18:32,389 --> 02:18:32,399
gold so the only way to do this properly
 

8175
02:18:32,399 --> 02:18:35,589
gold so the only way to do this properly
is to melt the gold bars down and recast

8176
02:18:35,589 --> 02:18:35,599
is to melt the gold bars down and recast
 

8177
02:18:35,599 --> 02:18:37,509
is to melt the gold bars down and recast
them which is pretty expensive

8178
02:18:37,509 --> 02:18:37,519
them which is pretty expensive
 

8179
02:18:37,519 --> 02:18:39,910
them which is pretty expensive
so we have this situation now where

8180
02:18:39,910 --> 02:18:39,920
so we have this situation now where
 

8181
02:18:39,920 --> 02:18:41,669
so we have this situation now where
russia which is major one of the biggest

02:18:41,679 --> 02:18:43,190
russia which is major one of the biggest

whether you think it's the war is

whether you think it's the war is
 

8207

is not not something i can opine on
 

8211
02:19:07,920 --> 02:19:10,389
is not not something i can opine on
but the implication of this is that

8212
02:19:10,389 --> 02:19:10,399
but the implication of this is that
 

8213
02:19:10,399 --> 02:19:12,070
but the implication of this is that
effectively the us might be shooting

8214
02:19:12,070 --> 02:19:12,080
effectively the us might be shooting
 

8215

effectively the us might be shooting

real this year
 

8241
02:19:38,240 --> 02:19:39,349
real this year
but

8242
02:19:39,349 --> 02:19:39,359
but
 

8243
02:19:39,359 --> 02:19:42,870
but
it's been decades of china iran and

8244
02:19:42,870 --> 02:19:42,880
it's been decades of china iran and
 

8245
02:19:42,880 --> 02:19:44,549
it's been decades of china iran and
russia to some extent saying that you

8246
02:19:44,549 --> 02:19:44,559
russia to some extent saying that you
 

8247
02:19:44,559 --> 02:19:46,150
russia to some extent saying that you
know we want to build an alternative to

8248
02:19:46,150 --> 02:19:46,160
know we want to build an alternative to
 

8249
02:19:46,160 --> 02:19:48,630
know we want to build an alternative to
the u.s dollar based system

8250
02:19:48,630 --> 02:19:48,640
the u.s dollar based system
 

8251
02:19:48,640 --> 02:19:50,389
the u.s dollar based system
and yet they haven't and i think there's

8252
02:19:50,389 --> 02:19:50,399
and yet they haven't and i think there's
 

8253
02:19:50,399 --> 02:19:51,670
and yet they haven't and i think there's
very good reasons they haven't and the

8254
02:19:51,670 --> 02:19:51,680
very good reasons they haven't and the
 

8255
02:19:51,680 --> 02:19:53,910
very good reasons they haven't and the
reason is what do you do with based on

8256
02:19:53,910 --> 02:19:53,920
reason is what do you do with based on
 

8257
02:19:53,920 --> 02:19:55,910
reason is what do you do with based on
how do you build it so you can do a

8258
02:19:55,910 --> 02:19:55,920
how do you build it so you can do a
 

8259
02:19:55,920 --> 02:19:58,630
how do you build it so you can do a
credit based system based on but then

8260
02:19:58,630 --> 02:19:58,640
credit based system based on but then
 

8261
02:19:58,640 --> 02:20:00,550
credit based system based on but then
who's going to be the big boss is it

8262
02:20:00,550 --> 02:20:00,560
who's going to be the big boss is it
 

8263
02:20:00,560 --> 02:20:01,990
who's going to be the big boss is it
going to be china is going to be russia

8264
02:20:01,990 --> 02:20:02,000
going to be china is going to be russia
 

8265
02:20:02,000 --> 02:20:03,190
going to be china is going to be russia
is it going to be iran is it going to be

8266
02:20:03,190 --> 02:20:03,200
is it going to be iran is it going to be
 

8267
02:20:03,200 --> 02:20:04,150
is it going to be iran is it going to be
india

8268
02:20:04,150 --> 02:20:04,160
india
 

8269
02:20:04,160 --> 02:20:06,230
india
none of these countries wants to be

8270
02:20:06,230 --> 02:20:06,240
none of these countries wants to be
 

8271
02:20:06,240 --> 02:20:07,670
none of these countries wants to be
well you know they don't want to jump

8272
02:20:07,670 --> 02:20:07,680
well you know they don't want to jump
 

8273
02:20:07,680 --> 02:20:10,389
well you know they don't want to jump
out of the um the u.s based system to

8274
02:20:10,389 --> 02:20:10,399
out of the um the u.s based system to
 

8275
02:20:10,399 --> 02:20:12,630
out of the um the u.s based system to
get into somebody else's base system so

8276
02:20:12,630 --> 02:20:12,640
get into somebody else's base system so
 

8277
02:20:12,640 --> 02:20:13,910
get into somebody else's base system so
china doesn't want to use a russian

8278
02:20:13,910 --> 02:20:13,920
china doesn't want to use a russian
 

8279
02:20:13,920 --> 02:20:15,110
china doesn't want to use a russian
system russia doesn't want to use a

8280
02:20:15,110 --> 02:20:15,120
system russia doesn't want to use a
 

8281
02:20:15,120 --> 02:20:16,389
system russia doesn't want to use a
chinese system

8282
02:20:16,389 --> 02:20:16,399
chinese system
 

8283
02:20:16,399 --> 02:20:18,070
chinese system
and so therefore you can't use their own

8284
02:20:18,070 --> 02:20:18,080
and so therefore you can't use their own
 

8285
02:20:18,080 --> 02:20:19,910
and so therefore you can't use their own
central banks currencies don't you think

8286
02:20:19,910 --> 02:20:19,920
central banks currencies don't you think
 

8287
02:20:19,920 --> 02:20:21,110
central banks currencies don't you think
they have enough

8288
02:20:21,110 --> 02:20:21,120
they have enough
 

8289
02:20:21,120 --> 02:20:23,190
they have enough
leverage

8290
02:20:23,190 --> 02:20:23,200
leverage
 

8291
02:20:23,200 --> 02:20:26,309
leverage
india china russia combined

8292
02:20:26,309 --> 02:20:26,319
india china russia combined
 

8293
02:20:26,319 --> 02:20:28,150
india china russia combined
with several other nations have enough

8294
02:20:28,150 --> 02:20:28,160
with several other nations have enough
 

8295
02:20:28,160 --> 02:20:30,389
with several other nations have enough
leverage and incentive to create their

8296
02:20:30,389 --> 02:20:30,399
leverage and incentive to create their
 

8297
02:20:30,399 --> 02:20:31,510
leverage and incentive to create their
own

8298
02:20:31,510 --> 02:20:31,520
own
 

8299
02:20:31,520 --> 02:20:33,990
own
system so any one player yes but if they

8300
02:20:33,990 --> 02:20:34,000
system so any one player yes but if they
 

8301
02:20:34,000 --> 02:20:35,429
system so any one player yes but if they
collaborate

8302
02:20:35,429 --> 02:20:35,439
collaborate
 

8303
02:20:35,439 --> 02:20:37,030
collaborate
yeah but then okay so what are you based

8304
02:20:37,030 --> 02:20:37,040
yeah but then okay so what are you based
 

8305
02:20:37,040 --> 02:20:38,070
yeah but then okay so what are you based
on like the

8306
02:20:38,070 --> 02:20:38,080
on like the
 

8307
02:20:38,080 --> 02:20:39,670
on like the
who who's going to be the boss who's

8308
02:20:39,670 --> 02:20:39,680
who who's going to be the boss who's
 

8309
02:20:39,680 --> 02:20:41,270
who who's going to be the boss who's
going to be the one who can in this case

8310
02:20:41,270 --> 02:20:41,280
going to be the one who can in this case
 

8311
02:20:41,280 --> 02:20:42,830
going to be the one who can in this case
china

8312
02:20:42,830 --> 02:20:42,840
china
 

8313
02:20:42,840 --> 02:20:45,110
china
right because china is becoming

8314
02:20:45,110 --> 02:20:45,120
right because china is becoming
 

8315
02:20:45,120 --> 02:20:46,870
right because china is becoming
increasingly an economic power in the

8316
02:20:46,870 --> 02:20:46,880
increasingly an economic power in the
 

8317
02:20:46,880 --> 02:20:49,830
increasingly an economic power in the
world yeah that's hard to deny yes it's

8318
02:20:49,830 --> 02:20:49,840
world yeah that's hard to deny yes it's
 

8319
02:20:49,840 --> 02:20:51,830
world yeah that's hard to deny yes it's
true and it's the most likely scenario

8320
02:20:51,830 --> 02:20:51,840
true and it's the most likely scenario
 

8321
02:20:51,840 --> 02:20:54,070
true and it's the most likely scenario
perhaps if we where to witness something

8322
02:20:54,070 --> 02:20:54,080
perhaps if we where to witness something
 

8323
02:20:54,080 --> 02:20:56,389
perhaps if we where to witness something
like this is going to be a chinese uh

8324
02:20:56,389 --> 02:20:56,399
like this is going to be a chinese uh
 

8325
02:20:56,399 --> 02:20:58,550
like this is going to be a chinese uh
based system is it possible to have

8326
02:20:58,550 --> 02:20:58,560
based system is it possible to have
 

8327
02:20:58,560 --> 02:21:00,389
based system is it possible to have
like a split

8328
02:21:00,389 --> 02:21:00,399
like a split
 

8329
02:21:00,399 --> 02:21:01,990
like a split
in um

8330
02:21:01,990 --> 02:21:02,000
in um
 

8331
02:21:02,000 --> 02:21:03,910
in um
what is the driving currency of the

8332
02:21:03,910 --> 02:21:03,920
what is the driving currency of the
 

8333
02:21:03,920 --> 02:21:05,910
what is the driving currency of the
world it's possible but i don't think

8334
02:21:05,910 --> 02:21:05,920
world it's possible but i don't think
 

8335
02:21:05,920 --> 02:21:07,670
world it's possible but i don't think
it's sustainable again money wants to be

8336
02:21:07,670 --> 02:21:07,680
it's sustainable again money wants to be
 

8337
02:21:07,680 --> 02:21:09,110
it's sustainable again money wants to be
won and that's the kind of thing that i

8338
02:21:09,110 --> 02:21:09,120
won and that's the kind of thing that i
 

8339
02:21:09,120 --> 02:21:11,429
won and that's the kind of thing that i
argue in that seminar so we could see

8340
02:21:11,429 --> 02:21:11,439
argue in that seminar so we could see
 

8341
02:21:11,439 --> 02:21:14,309
argue in that seminar so we could see
this emerge based around the yuan and

8342
02:21:14,309 --> 02:21:14,319
this emerge based around the yuan and
 

8343
02:21:14,319 --> 02:21:17,030
this emerge based around the yuan and
you know likely i mean russia is

8344
02:21:17,030 --> 02:21:17,040
you know likely i mean russia is
 

8345
02:21:17,040 --> 02:21:18,790
you know likely i mean russia is
obviously going to hurt economically

8346
02:21:18,790 --> 02:21:18,800
obviously going to hurt economically
 

8347
02:21:18,800 --> 02:21:20,230
obviously going to hurt economically
from what happened from the confiscation

8348
02:21:20,230 --> 02:21:20,240
from what happened from the confiscation
 

8349
02:21:20,240 --> 02:21:22,070
from what happened from the confiscation
of the reserves and from the sanctions

8350
02:21:22,070 --> 02:21:22,080
of the reserves and from the sanctions
 

8351
02:21:22,080 --> 02:21:24,389
of the reserves and from the sanctions
so it's not going to be in a position

8352
02:21:24,389 --> 02:21:24,399
so it's not going to be in a position
 

8353
02:21:24,399 --> 02:21:25,750
so it's not going to be in a position
and of course because it's outside of

8354
02:21:25,750 --> 02:21:25,760
and of course because it's outside of
 

8355
02:21:25,760 --> 02:21:27,590
and of course because it's outside of
the us-based system

8356
02:21:27,590 --> 02:21:27,600
the us-based system
 

8357
02:21:27,600 --> 02:21:29,190
the us-based system
it's not in the strongest negotiating

8358
02:21:29,190 --> 02:21:29,200
it's not in the strongest negotiating
 

8359
02:21:29,200 --> 02:21:30,950
it's not in the strongest negotiating
position with the chinese so the chinese

8360
02:21:30,950 --> 02:21:30,960
position with the chinese so the chinese
 

8361
02:21:30,960 --> 02:21:33,110
position with the chinese so the chinese
might be able to get them to join their

8362
02:21:33,110 --> 02:21:33,120
might be able to get them to join their
 

8363
02:21:33,120 --> 02:21:34,790
might be able to get them to join their
yuan-based system

8364
02:21:34,790 --> 02:21:34,800
yuan-based system
 

8365
02:21:34,800 --> 02:21:36,150
yuan-based system
but i don't think that's sustainable in

8366
02:21:36,150 --> 02:21:36,160
but i don't think that's sustainable in
 

8367
02:21:36,160 --> 02:21:38,469
but i don't think that's sustainable in
the long run because

8368
02:21:38,469 --> 02:21:38,479
the long run because
 

8369
02:21:38,479 --> 02:21:40,950
the long run because
these governments can issue their laws

8370
02:21:40,950 --> 02:21:40,960
these governments can issue their laws
 

8371
02:21:40,960 --> 02:21:42,950
these governments can issue their laws
and make their

8372
02:21:42,950 --> 02:21:42,960
and make their
 

8373
02:21:42,960 --> 02:21:44,550
and make their
designs and then make their monetary

8374
02:21:44,550 --> 02:21:44,560
designs and then make their monetary
 

8375
02:21:44,560 --> 02:21:47,990
designs and then make their monetary
systems but ultimately

8376
02:21:47,990 --> 02:21:48,000

 

8377
02:21:48,000 --> 02:21:49,670

there's there are billions of chinese

8378
02:21:49,670 --> 02:21:49,680
there's there are billions of chinese
 

8379
02:21:49,680 --> 02:21:51,429
there's there are billions of chinese
people and billions of dollar-based

8380
02:21:51,429 --> 02:21:51,439
people and billions of dollar-based
 

8381
02:21:51,439 --> 02:21:52,550
people and billions of dollar-based
people and they're going to want to

8382
02:21:52,550 --> 02:21:52,560
people and they're going to want to
 

8383
02:21:52,560 --> 02:21:54,309
people and they're going to want to
trade with one another and the power to

8384
02:21:54,309 --> 02:21:54,319
trade with one another and the power to
 

8385
02:21:54,319 --> 02:21:55,750
trade with one another and the power to
want to trade with one another is too

8386
02:21:55,750 --> 02:21:55,760
want to trade with one another is too
 

8387
02:21:55,760 --> 02:21:57,270
want to trade with one another is too
strong that we can't just split the

8388
02:21:57,270 --> 02:21:57,280
strong that we can't just split the
 

8389
02:21:57,280 --> 02:21:59,349
strong that we can't just split the
world economy into two monetary systems

8390
02:21:59,349 --> 02:21:59,359
world economy into two monetary systems
 

8391
02:21:59,359 --> 02:22:00,790
world economy into two monetary systems
that don't trade with one another so

8392
02:22:00,790 --> 02:22:00,800
that don't trade with one another so
 

8393
02:22:00,800 --> 02:22:02,070
that don't trade with one another so
then they're going to want to trade with

8394
02:22:02,070 --> 02:22:02,080
then they're going to want to trade with
 

8395
02:22:02,080 --> 02:22:03,750
then they're going to want to trade with
one another or

8396
02:22:03,750 --> 02:22:03,760
one another or
 

8397
02:22:03,760 --> 02:22:05,030
one another or
the dark

8398
02:22:05,030 --> 02:22:05,040
the dark
 

8399
02:22:05,040 --> 02:22:06,830
the dark
possibility

8400
02:22:06,830 --> 02:22:06,840
possibility
 

8401
02:22:06,840 --> 02:22:08,790
possibility
is it

8402
02:22:08,790 --> 02:22:08,800
is it
 

8403
02:22:08,800 --> 02:22:12,230
is it
the inability to trade as opposed to

8404
02:22:12,230 --> 02:22:12,240
the inability to trade as opposed to
 

8405
02:22:12,240 --> 02:22:14,630
the inability to trade as opposed to
being a forcing function for trade it

8406
02:22:14,630 --> 02:22:14,640
being a forcing function for trade it
 

8407
02:22:14,640 --> 02:22:16,550
being a forcing function for trade it
could become a forcing function for

8408
02:22:16,550 --> 02:22:16,560
could become a forcing function for
 

8409
02:22:16,560 --> 02:22:17,590
could become a forcing function for
conflict

8410
02:22:17,590 --> 02:22:17,600
conflict
 

8411
02:22:17,600 --> 02:22:20,230
conflict
in cyberspace and potentially hot war

8412
02:22:20,230 --> 02:22:20,240
in cyberspace and potentially hot war
 

8413
02:22:20,240 --> 02:22:22,550
in cyberspace and potentially hot war
yes this is the scary part of it and

8414
02:22:22,550 --> 02:22:22,560
yes this is the scary part of it and
 

8415
02:22:22,560 --> 02:22:24,150
yes this is the scary part of it and
this is basically how world war ii

8416
02:22:24,150 --> 02:22:24,160
this is basically how world war ii
 

8417
02:22:24,160 --> 02:22:26,469
this is basically how world war ii
happened you know because uh there's an

8418
02:22:26,469 --> 02:22:26,479
happened you know because uh there's an
 

8419
02:22:26,479 --> 02:22:28,870
happened you know because uh there's an
old uh historian who used to say when um

8420
02:22:28,870 --> 02:22:28,880
old uh historian who used to say when um
 

8421
02:22:28,880 --> 02:22:30,309
old uh historian who used to say when um
oh i think his name is auto mallory and

8422
02:22:30,309 --> 02:22:30,319
oh i think his name is auto mallory and
 

8423
02:22:30,319 --> 02:22:32,150
oh i think his name is auto mallory and
i quote him in the bitcoin standard if

8424
02:22:32,150 --> 02:22:32,160
i quote him in the bitcoin standard if
 

8425
02:22:32,160 --> 02:22:34,309
i quote him in the bitcoin standard if
goods don't cross borders then bombs

8426
02:22:34,309 --> 02:22:34,319
goods don't cross borders then bombs
 

8427
02:22:34,319 --> 02:22:35,429
goods don't cross borders then bombs
will

8428
02:22:35,429 --> 02:22:35,439
will
 

8429
02:22:35,439 --> 02:22:36,790
will
if people trade with one another they

8430
02:22:36,790 --> 02:22:36,800
if people trade with one another they
 

8431
02:22:36,800 --> 02:22:38,550
if people trade with one another they
have an incentive for each other's

8432
02:22:38,550 --> 02:22:38,560
have an incentive for each other's
 

8433
02:22:38,560 --> 02:22:40,309
have an incentive for each other's
well-being and then

8434
02:22:40,309 --> 02:22:40,319
well-being and then
 

8435
02:22:40,319 --> 02:22:42,389
well-being and then
they have less of an incentive to fight

8436
02:22:42,389 --> 02:22:42,399
they have less of an incentive to fight
 

8437
02:22:42,399 --> 02:22:44,389
they have less of an incentive to fight
and it was the death of global trade in

8438
02:22:44,389 --> 02:22:44,399
and it was the death of global trade in
 

8439
02:22:44,399 --> 02:22:47,270
and it was the death of global trade in
the 1930s because of the failure of the

8440
02:22:47,270 --> 02:22:47,280
the 1930s because of the failure of the
 

8441
02:22:47,280 --> 02:22:50,309
the 1930s because of the failure of the
fiat system that brought about the rise

8442
02:22:50,309 --> 02:22:50,319
fiat system that brought about the rise
 

8443
02:22:50,319 --> 02:22:52,790
fiat system that brought about the rise
of the populism that on the rise of all

8444
02:22:52,790 --> 02:22:52,800
of the populism that on the rise of all
 

8445
02:22:52,800 --> 02:22:54,070
of the populism that on the rise of all
those leaders that hated each other and

8446
02:22:54,070 --> 02:22:54,080
those leaders that hated each other and
 

8447
02:22:54,080 --> 02:22:55,270
those leaders that hated each other and
helped finance the war and bring it

8448
02:22:55,270 --> 02:22:55,280
helped finance the war and bring it
 

8449
02:22:55,280 --> 02:22:58,870
helped finance the war and bring it
about so that is the scary possibility

8450
02:22:58,870 --> 02:22:58,880
about so that is the scary possibility
 

8451
02:22:58,880 --> 02:23:00,070
about so that is the scary possibility
um and of course you know you can't

8452
02:23:00,070 --> 02:23:00,080
um and of course you know you can't
 

8453
02:23:00,080 --> 02:23:01,830
um and of course you know you can't
discount that with all the escalation

8454
02:23:01,830 --> 02:23:01,840
discount that with all the escalation
 

8455
02:23:01,840 --> 02:23:03,510
discount that with all the escalation
that you see that is a possibility that

8456
02:23:03,510 --> 02:23:03,520
that you see that is a possibility that
 

8457
02:23:03,520 --> 02:23:05,990
that you see that is a possibility that
it could turn into a real war but then

8458
02:23:05,990 --> 02:23:06,000
it could turn into a real war but then
 

8459
02:23:06,000 --> 02:23:07,510
it could turn into a real war but then
even so

8460
02:23:07,510 --> 02:23:07,520
even so
 

8461
02:23:07,520 --> 02:23:09,110
even so
i think ultimately

8462
02:23:09,110 --> 02:23:09,120
i think ultimately
 

8463
02:23:09,120 --> 02:23:11,190
i think ultimately
you can't fight wars forever

8464
02:23:11,190 --> 02:23:11,200
you can't fight wars forever
 

8465
02:23:11,200 --> 02:23:12,790
you can't fight wars forever
there's going to it's going to end at

8466
02:23:12,790 --> 02:23:12,800
there's going to it's going to end at
 

8467
02:23:12,800 --> 02:23:14,630
there's going to it's going to end at
some point and we're going to be back at

8468
02:23:14,630 --> 02:23:14,640
some point and we're going to be back at
 

8469
02:23:14,640 --> 02:23:16,710
some point and we're going to be back at
square one or well not in square one

8470
02:23:16,710 --> 02:23:16,720
square one or well not in square one
 

8471
02:23:16,720 --> 02:23:17,670
square one or well not in square one
we're going to be back at the same

8472
02:23:17,670 --> 02:23:17,680
we're going to be back at the same
 

8473
02:23:17,680 --> 02:23:19,910
we're going to be back at the same
dilemma of who's going to have the

8474
02:23:19,910 --> 02:23:19,920
dilemma of who's going to have the
 

8475
02:23:19,920 --> 02:23:22,950
dilemma of who's going to have the
global monetary system and so one

8476
02:23:22,950 --> 02:23:22,960
global monetary system and so one
 

8477
02:23:22,960 --> 02:23:24,469
global monetary system and so one
alternative is that what the chinese and

8478
02:23:24,469 --> 02:23:24,479
alternative is that what the chinese and
 

8479
02:23:24,479 --> 02:23:26,790
alternative is that what the chinese and
the russians could do is they could base

8480
02:23:26,790 --> 02:23:26,800
the russians could do is they could base
 

8481
02:23:26,800 --> 02:23:28,790
the russians could do is they could base
it on a commodity so a lot of people are

8482
02:23:28,790 --> 02:23:28,800
it on a commodity so a lot of people are
 

8483
02:23:28,800 --> 02:23:30,150
it on a commodity so a lot of people are
now saying well they're going to base it

8484
02:23:30,150 --> 02:23:30,160
now saying well they're going to base it
 

8485
02:23:30,160 --> 02:23:32,070
now saying well they're going to base it
on copper and

8486
02:23:32,070 --> 02:23:32,080
on copper and
 

8487
02:23:32,080 --> 02:23:35,349
on copper and
corn and agricultural commodities

8488
02:23:35,349 --> 02:23:35,359
corn and agricultural commodities
 

8489
02:23:35,359 --> 02:23:37,190
corn and agricultural commodities
and that's that's the analysis of

8490
02:23:37,190 --> 02:23:37,200
and that's that's the analysis of
 

8491
02:23:37,200 --> 02:23:38,950
and that's that's the analysis of
assailability that we discuss in the

8492
02:23:38,950 --> 02:23:38,960
assailability that we discuss in the
 

8493
02:23:38,960 --> 02:23:40,469
assailability that we discuss in the
bitcoin standard in the fiat standard

8494
02:23:40,469 --> 02:23:40,479
bitcoin standard in the fiat standard
 

8495
02:23:40,479 --> 02:23:42,309
bitcoin standard in the fiat standard
that's i don't think that's workable if

8496
02:23:42,309 --> 02:23:42,319
that's i don't think that's workable if
 

8497
02:23:42,319 --> 02:23:43,990
that's i don't think that's workable if
you end up basing the monetary system on

8498
02:23:43,990 --> 02:23:44,000
you end up basing the monetary system on
 

8499
02:23:44,000 --> 02:23:46,150
you end up basing the monetary system on
copper as we said earlier it doesn't

8500
02:23:46,150 --> 02:23:46,160
copper as we said earlier it doesn't
 

8501
02:23:46,160 --> 02:23:47,510
copper as we said earlier it doesn't
matter how many governments say that

8502
02:23:47,510 --> 02:23:47,520
matter how many governments say that
 

8503
02:23:47,520 --> 02:23:49,670
matter how many governments say that
we're going to make a new monetary

8504
02:23:49,670 --> 02:23:49,680
we're going to make a new monetary
 

8505
02:23:49,680 --> 02:23:51,670
we're going to make a new monetary
system based on

8506
02:23:51,670 --> 02:23:51,680
system based on
 

8507
02:23:51,680 --> 02:23:55,590
system based on
copper grains and nickel and iron and so

8508
02:23:55,590 --> 02:23:55,600
copper grains and nickel and iron and so
 

8509
02:23:55,600 --> 02:23:57,590
copper grains and nickel and iron and so
on it doesn't matter you're just going

8510
02:23:57,590 --> 02:23:57,600
on it doesn't matter you're just going
 

8511
02:23:57,600 --> 02:23:58,630
on it doesn't matter you're just going
to stockpile you're going to have to

8512
02:23:58,630 --> 02:23:58,640
to stockpile you're going to have to
 

8513
02:23:58,640 --> 02:24:00,550
to stockpile you're going to have to
stockpile those things in order to make

8514
02:24:00,550 --> 02:24:00,560
stockpile those things in order to make
 

8515
02:24:00,560 --> 02:24:02,230
stockpile those things in order to make
a market in them

8516
02:24:02,230 --> 02:24:02,240
a market in them
 

8517
02:24:02,240 --> 02:24:03,590
a market in them
and then if you talk about those things

8518
02:24:03,590 --> 02:24:03,600
and then if you talk about those things
 

8519
02:24:03,600 --> 02:24:05,830
and then if you talk about those things
you're just raising their value inviting

8520
02:24:05,830 --> 02:24:05,840
you're just raising their value inviting
 

8521
02:24:05,840 --> 02:24:07,910
you're just raising their value inviting
the producers to make more flood the

8522
02:24:07,910 --> 02:24:07,920
the producers to make more flood the
 

8523
02:24:07,920 --> 02:24:09,830
the producers to make more flood the
market i hope they don't try this

8524
02:24:09,830 --> 02:24:09,840
market i hope they don't try this
 

8525
02:24:09,840 --> 02:24:11,510
market i hope they don't try this
because it's going to be a devastating

8526
02:24:11,510 --> 02:24:11,520
because it's going to be a devastating
 

8527
02:24:11,520 --> 02:24:13,510
because it's going to be a devastating
devastating

8528
02:24:13,510 --> 02:24:13,520
devastating
 

8529
02:24:13,520 --> 02:24:15,349
devastating
impact on the world economy you're going

8530
02:24:15,349 --> 02:24:15,359
impact on the world economy you're going
 

8531
02:24:15,359 --> 02:24:16,230
impact on the world economy you're going
to have

8532
02:24:16,230 --> 02:24:16,240
to have
 

8533
02:24:16,240 --> 02:24:17,910
to have
central banks bidding up the price of

8534
02:24:17,910 --> 02:24:17,920
central banks bidding up the price of
 

8535
02:24:17,920 --> 02:24:19,429
central banks bidding up the price of
essential commodities that people need

8536
02:24:19,429 --> 02:24:19,439
essential commodities that people need
 

8537
02:24:19,439 --> 02:24:21,670
essential commodities that people need
for real uses in order to back their

8538
02:24:21,670 --> 02:24:21,680
for real uses in order to back their
 

8539
02:24:21,680 --> 02:24:23,590
for real uses in order to back their
currencies with them and then just

8540
02:24:23,590 --> 02:24:23,600
currencies with them and then just
 

8541
02:24:23,600 --> 02:24:25,190
currencies with them and then just
incentivizing the producers to make more

8542
02:24:25,190 --> 02:24:25,200
incentivizing the producers to make more
 

8543
02:24:25,200 --> 02:24:26,710
incentivizing the producers to make more
and more and more of it and then

8544
02:24:26,710 --> 02:24:26,720
and more and more of it and then
 

8545
02:24:26,720 --> 02:24:28,150
and more and more of it and then
bringing the price back down so it's

8546
02:24:28,150 --> 02:24:28,160
bringing the price back down so it's
 

8547
02:24:28,160 --> 02:24:29,750
bringing the price back down so it's
going to be a very expensive mistake

8548
02:24:29,750 --> 02:24:29,760
going to be a very expensive mistake
 

8549
02:24:29,760 --> 02:24:31,590
going to be a very expensive mistake
where we raise the price of copper

8550
02:24:31,590 --> 02:24:31,600
where we raise the price of copper
 

8551
02:24:31,600 --> 02:24:33,429
where we raise the price of copper
destroy a lot of industries dependent on

8552
02:24:33,429 --> 02:24:33,439
destroy a lot of industries dependent on
 

8553
02:24:33,439 --> 02:24:34,790
destroy a lot of industries dependent on
copper it's not just copper but also

8554
02:24:34,790 --> 02:24:34,800
copper it's not just copper but also
 

8555
02:24:34,800 --> 02:24:37,110
copper it's not just copper but also
food and then increase the supply beyond

8556
02:24:37,110 --> 02:24:37,120
food and then increase the supply beyond
 

8557
02:24:37,120 --> 02:24:39,190
food and then increase the supply beyond
what we need and the

8558
02:24:39,190 --> 02:24:39,200
what we need and the
 

8559
02:24:39,200 --> 02:24:41,030
what we need and the
end result is copper miners make out

8560
02:24:41,030 --> 02:24:41,040
end result is copper miners make out
 

8561
02:24:41,040 --> 02:24:43,670
end result is copper miners make out
well governments go broke

8562
02:24:43,670 --> 02:24:43,680
well governments go broke
 

8563
02:24:43,680 --> 02:24:45,349
well governments go broke
and we end up with a lot of rust and

8564
02:24:45,349 --> 02:24:45,359
and we end up with a lot of rust and
 

8565
02:24:45,359 --> 02:24:47,510
and we end up with a lot of rust and
copper in uh

8566
02:24:47,510 --> 02:24:47,520
copper in uh
 

8567
02:24:47,520 --> 02:24:49,750
copper in uh
government uh warehouses that's why i

8568
02:24:49,750 --> 02:24:49,760
government uh warehouses that's why i
 

8569
02:24:49,760 --> 02:24:52,630
government uh warehouses that's why i
don't think it works for the uh

8570
02:24:52,630 --> 02:24:52,640
don't think it works for the uh
 

8571
02:24:52,640 --> 02:24:55,030
don't think it works for the uh
to use commodities that are not monetary

8572
02:24:55,030 --> 02:24:55,040
to use commodities that are not monetary
 

8573
02:24:55,040 --> 02:24:57,270
to use commodities that are not monetary
commodities then the question is maybe

8574
02:24:57,270 --> 02:24:57,280
commodities then the question is maybe
 

8575
02:24:57,280 --> 02:24:58,389
commodities then the question is maybe
gold

8576
02:24:58,389 --> 02:24:58,399
gold
 

8577
02:24:58,399 --> 02:25:00,710
gold
can we go back on another gold standard

8578
02:25:00,710 --> 02:25:00,720
can we go back on another gold standard
 

8579
02:25:00,720 --> 02:25:03,910
can we go back on another gold standard
and um i mean russia seems to have done

8580
02:25:03,910 --> 02:25:03,920
and um i mean russia seems to have done
 

8581
02:25:03,920 --> 02:25:06,070
and um i mean russia seems to have done
that i'm not so sure it's very difficult

8582
02:25:06,070 --> 02:25:06,080
that i'm not so sure it's very difficult
 

8583
02:25:06,080 --> 02:25:07,750
that i'm not so sure it's very difficult
to get reliable information i'm trying

8584
02:25:07,750 --> 02:25:07,760
to get reliable information i'm trying
 

8585
02:25:07,760 --> 02:25:10,710
to get reliable information i'm trying
to look into this more but they seem to

8586
02:25:10,710 --> 02:25:10,720
to look into this more but they seem to
 

8587
02:25:10,720 --> 02:25:13,030
to look into this more but they seem to
have said that they're um they're fixing

8588
02:25:13,030 --> 02:25:13,040
have said that they're um they're fixing
 

8589
02:25:13,040 --> 02:25:15,670
have said that they're um they're fixing
the price of gold in rubles so they will

8590
02:25:15,670 --> 02:25:15,680
the price of gold in rubles so they will
 

8591
02:25:15,680 --> 02:25:18,469
the price of gold in rubles so they will
buy and sell gold at a fixed drubal rate

8592
02:25:18,469 --> 02:25:18,479
buy and sell gold at a fixed drubal rate
 

8593
02:25:18,479 --> 02:25:19,910
buy and sell gold at a fixed drubal rate
which effectively means you're on a gold

8594
02:25:19,910 --> 02:25:19,920
which effectively means you're on a gold
 

8595
02:25:19,920 --> 02:25:23,510
which effectively means you're on a gold
standard now i'm not sure how uh much

8596
02:25:23,510 --> 02:25:23,520
standard now i'm not sure how uh much
 

8597
02:25:23,520 --> 02:25:25,670
standard now i'm not sure how uh much
how serious this is how they've managed

8598
02:25:25,670 --> 02:25:25,680
how serious this is how they've managed
 

8599
02:25:25,680 --> 02:25:27,190
how serious this is how they've managed
to stick to it but it seems to have

8600
02:25:27,190 --> 02:25:27,200
to stick to it but it seems to have
 

8601

i think you know the the point of this

8630
02:25:58,389 --> 02:25:58,399
i think you know the the point of this
 

8631
02:25:58,399 --> 02:25:59,910
i think you know the the point of this
discussion is that you know we run

through all these other options you know
a chinese-based system why it probably

8636
02:26:03,830 --> 02:26:03,840
a chinese-based system why it probably
 

8637
02:26:03,840 --> 02:26:05,670
a chinese-based system why it probably
won't work a commodity-based system why

8638
02:26:05,670 --> 02:26:05,680
won't work a commodity-based system why
 

8639
02:26:05,680 --> 02:26:07,830
won't work a commodity-based system why
it won't work and a gold-based system

8640
02:26:07,830 --> 02:26:07,840
it won't work and a gold-based system
 

8641
02:26:07,840 --> 02:26:09,590
it won't work and a gold-based system
why it won't work i think they might

8642
02:26:09,590 --> 02:26:09,600
why it won't work i think they might
 

8643
02:26:09,600 --> 02:26:11,910
why it won't work i think they might
have to learn this the wrong way

8644

have to learn this the wrong way
 

8645
02:26:11,920 --> 02:26:14,790
have to learn this the wrong way
i mean the hard way but eventually i

8646
02:26:14,790 --> 02:26:14,800
i mean the hard way but eventually i
 

8647
02:26:14,800 --> 02:26:15,990
i mean the hard way but eventually i
don't see them doing it now but

02:26:17,830 --> 02:26:17,840
eventually i think
 

8651
02:26:17,840 --> 02:26:19,429
eventually i think
the winning move is going to be to go on

bitcoin so unfortunately i think we're

8670
02:26:38,230 --> 02:26:38,240
bitcoin so unfortunately i think we're
 

8671
02:26:38,240 --> 02:26:40,870
bitcoin so unfortunately i think we're
going to go through a few

8672

going to go through a few
 

8673
02:26:40,880 --> 02:26:43,270
going to go through a few
years maybe many years of

8674
02:26:43,270 --> 02:26:43,280
years maybe many years of
 

8675
02:26:43,280 --> 02:26:45,110
years maybe many years of
learning the lesson the hard way of

8676
02:26:45,110 --> 02:26:45,120
learning the lesson the hard way of
 

8677
02:26:45,120 --> 02:26:46,710

02:28:13,359 --> 02:28:16,150
they're all peers and what this software
does is that it allows you to operate a

8762
02:28:16,150 --> 02:28:16,160
does is that it allows you to operate a
 

8763
02:28:16,160 --> 02:28:17,590
does is that it allows you to operate a
payment network

8764
02:28:17,590 --> 02:28:17,600
payment network
 

8765
02:28:17,600 --> 02:28:19,750
payment network
between those peers and that payment

8766
02:28:19,750 --> 02:28:19,760
between those peers and that payment
 

8767
02:28:19,760 --> 02:28:22,309
between those peers and that payment
network has its own currency

8768
02:28:22,309 --> 02:28:22,319
network has its own currency
 

8769
02:28:22,319 --> 02:28:24,870
network has its own currency
and that seems like you know just a

8770
02:28:24,870 --> 02:28:24,880
and that seems like you know just a
 

8771
02:28:24,880 --> 02:28:26,790
and that seems like you know just a
simple software game but the reason this

8772
02:28:26,790 --> 02:28:26,800
simple software game but the reason this
 

8773
02:28:26,800 --> 02:28:29,590
simple software game but the reason this
is such a big deal is i believe bitcoin

8774
02:28:29,590 --> 02:28:29,600
is such a big deal is i believe bitcoin
 

8775
02:28:29,600 --> 02:28:31,270
is such a big deal is i believe bitcoin
is the most advanced form of money ever

8776
02:28:31,270 --> 02:28:31,280
is the most advanced form of money ever
 

8777
02:28:31,280 --> 02:28:32,230
is the most advanced form of money ever
invented

8778
02:28:32,230 --> 02:28:32,240
invented
 

8779
02:28:32,240 --> 02:28:34,230
invented
and the reason for that comes from two

8780
02:28:34,230 --> 02:28:34,240
and the reason for that comes from two
 

8781
02:28:34,240 --> 02:28:36,710
and the reason for that comes from two
properties that this network has

8782
02:28:36,710 --> 02:28:36,720
properties that this network has
 

8783
02:28:36,720 --> 02:28:38,150
properties that this network has
the first one

8784
02:28:38,150 --> 02:28:38,160
the first one
 

8785
02:28:38,160 --> 02:28:40,550
the first one
is that the currency is the hardest

8786
02:28:40,550 --> 02:28:40,560
is that the currency is the hardest
 

8787
02:28:40,560 --> 02:28:42,230
is that the currency is the hardest
money ever invented it's the money whose

8788
02:28:42,230 --> 02:28:42,240
money ever invented it's the money whose
 

8789
02:28:42,240 --> 02:28:43,349
money ever invented it's the money whose
supply

8790
02:28:43,349 --> 02:28:43,359
supply
 

8791
02:28:43,359 --> 02:28:46,230
supply
is the most resistant to inflation it's

8792
02:28:46,230 --> 02:28:46,240
is the most resistant to inflation it's
 

8793
02:28:46,240 --> 02:28:48,389
is the most resistant to inflation it's
the first monetary asset that we've ever

8794
02:28:48,389 --> 02:28:48,399
the first monetary asset that we've ever
 

8795
02:28:48,399 --> 02:28:50,870
the first monetary asset that we've ever
invented that is guaranteed to be fixed

8796
02:28:50,870 --> 02:28:50,880
invented that is guaranteed to be fixed
 

8797
02:28:50,880 --> 02:28:53,190
invented that is guaranteed to be fixed
in its supply that cannot be increased

8798
02:28:53,190 --> 02:28:53,200
in its supply that cannot be increased
 

8799
02:28:53,200 --> 02:28:55,030
in its supply that cannot be increased
beyond a certain number so there's only

8800
02:28:55,030 --> 02:28:55,040
beyond a certain number so there's only
 

8801
02:28:55,040 --> 02:28:56,950
beyond a certain number so there's only
ever going to be 21 million bitcoins and

8802
02:28:56,950 --> 02:28:56,960
ever going to be 21 million bitcoins and
 

8803
02:28:56,960 --> 02:28:57,750
ever going to be 21 million bitcoins and
that's

8804
02:28:57,750 --> 02:28:57,760
that's
 

8805
02:28:57,760 --> 02:28:59,910
that's
that's a that's a qualitative leap

8806
02:28:59,910 --> 02:28:59,920
that's a that's a qualitative leap
 

8807
02:28:59,920 --> 02:29:02,710
that's a that's a qualitative leap
forward in our technologies of money all

8808
02:29:02,710 --> 02:29:02,720
forward in our technologies of money all
 

8809
02:29:02,720 --> 02:29:03,910
forward in our technologies of money all
of our monies

8810
02:29:03,910 --> 02:29:03,920
of our monies
 

8811
02:29:03,920 --> 02:29:06,150
of our monies
leak essentially because people can

8812
02:29:06,150 --> 02:29:06,160
leak essentially because people can
 

8813
02:29:06,160 --> 02:29:08,070
leak essentially because people can
always make more and more and more of

8814
02:29:08,070 --> 02:29:08,080
always make more and more and more of
 

8815
02:29:08,080 --> 02:29:09,510
always make more and more and more of
them you know the best money is the one

8816
02:29:09,510 --> 02:29:09,520
them you know the best money is the one
 

8817
02:29:09,520 --> 02:29:11,670
them you know the best money is the one
that leaks the least which is gold

8818
02:29:11,670 --> 02:29:11,680
that leaks the least which is gold
 

8819
02:29:11,680 --> 02:29:13,270
that leaks the least which is gold
because it only leaks one and a half

8820
02:29:13,270 --> 02:29:13,280
because it only leaks one and a half
 

8821
02:29:13,280 --> 02:29:16,070
because it only leaks one and a half
percent in other words your share of the

8822
02:29:16,070 --> 02:29:16,080
percent in other words your share of the
 

8823
02:29:16,080 --> 02:29:17,830
percent in other words your share of the
gold stock

8824
02:29:17,830 --> 02:29:17,840
gold stock
 

8825
02:29:17,840 --> 02:29:20,070
gold stock
is diluted by one and a half percent

8826
02:29:20,070 --> 02:29:20,080
is diluted by one and a half percent
 

8827
02:29:20,080 --> 02:29:22,630
is diluted by one and a half percent
every year ideally you'd like it to be

8828
02:29:22,630 --> 02:29:22,640
every year ideally you'd like it to be
 

8829
02:29:22,640 --> 02:29:24,710
every year ideally you'd like it to be
zero bitcoin is currently at around one

8830
02:29:24,710 --> 02:29:24,720
zero bitcoin is currently at around one
 

8831
02:29:24,720 --> 02:29:27,349
zero bitcoin is currently at around one
point eight percent headed towards zero

8832
02:29:27,349 --> 02:29:27,359
point eight percent headed towards zero
 

8833
02:29:27,359 --> 02:29:28,790
point eight percent headed towards zero
so it's the first money that we've ever

8834
02:29:28,790 --> 02:29:28,800
so it's the first money that we've ever
 

8835
02:29:28,800 --> 02:29:31,030
so it's the first money that we've ever
had that goes to zero in terms of

8836
02:29:31,030 --> 02:29:31,040
had that goes to zero in terms of
 

8837
02:29:31,040 --> 02:29:33,110
had that goes to zero in terms of
terminal supply so there'll never be

8838
02:29:33,110 --> 02:29:33,120
terminal supply so there'll never be
 

8839
02:29:33,120 --> 02:29:34,790
terminal supply so there'll never be
more than 21 million bitcoin i think

8840
02:29:34,790 --> 02:29:34,800
more than 21 million bitcoin i think
 

8841
02:29:34,800 --> 02:29:36,710
more than 21 million bitcoin i think
that's a huge deal because you know

8842
02:29:36,710 --> 02:29:36,720
that's a huge deal because you know
 

8843
02:29:36,720 --> 02:29:38,230
that's a huge deal because you know
as i said earlier

8844
02:29:38,230 --> 02:29:38,240
as i said earlier
 

8845
02:29:38,240 --> 02:29:39,910
as i said earlier
money is always whatever is the hardest

8846
02:29:39,910 --> 02:29:39,920
money is always whatever is the hardest
 

8847
02:29:39,920 --> 02:29:41,910
money is always whatever is the hardest
to make and now bitcoin is the hardest

8848
02:29:41,910 --> 02:29:41,920
to make and now bitcoin is the hardest
 

8849
02:29:41,920 --> 02:29:43,110
to make and now bitcoin is the hardest
thing to make

8850
02:29:43,110 --> 02:29:43,120
thing to make
 

8851
02:29:43,120 --> 02:29:44,790
thing to make
and then the second property which is

8852
02:29:44,790 --> 02:29:44,800
and then the second property which is
 

8853
02:29:44,800 --> 02:29:46,710
and then the second property which is
extremely important as well

8854
02:29:46,710 --> 02:29:46,720
extremely important as well
 

8855
02:29:46,720 --> 02:29:48,950
extremely important as well
is the fact that it operates

8856
02:29:48,950 --> 02:29:48,960
is the fact that it operates
 

8857
02:29:48,960 --> 02:29:51,590
is the fact that it operates
without the need to trust in anybody it

8858
02:29:51,590 --> 02:29:51,600
without the need to trust in anybody it
 

8859
02:29:51,600 --> 02:29:53,349
without the need to trust in anybody it
doesn't have a party that is in charge

8860
02:29:53,349 --> 02:29:53,359
doesn't have a party that is in charge
 

8861
02:29:53,359 --> 02:29:54,870
doesn't have a party that is in charge
of it it doesn't have a central

8862
02:29:54,870 --> 02:29:54,880
of it it doesn't have a central
 

8863
02:29:54,880 --> 02:29:56,950
of it it doesn't have a central
authority that can um

8864
02:29:56,950 --> 02:29:56,960
authority that can um
 

8865
02:29:56,960 --> 02:29:57,910
authority that can um
you know it's as i said it's

8866
02:29:57,910 --> 02:29:57,920
you know it's as i said it's
 

8867
02:29:57,920 --> 02:29:59,910
you know it's as i said it's
peer-to-peer so there's it only has

8868
02:29:59,910 --> 02:29:59,920
peer-to-peer so there's it only has
 

8869
02:29:59,920 --> 02:30:02,309
peer-to-peer so there's it only has
users it doesn't have any admins

8870
02:30:02,309 --> 02:30:02,319
users it doesn't have any admins
 

8871
02:30:02,319 --> 02:30:04,230
users it doesn't have any admins
there's no authority in charge of

8872
02:30:04,230 --> 02:30:04,240
there's no authority in charge of
 

8873
02:30:04,240 --> 02:30:05,830
there's no authority in charge of
bitcoin that can take your bitcoin that

8874
02:30:05,830 --> 02:30:05,840
bitcoin that can take your bitcoin that
 

8875
02:30:05,840 --> 02:30:08,230
bitcoin that can take your bitcoin that
can stop you from using bitcoin uh that

8876
02:30:08,230 --> 02:30:08,240
can stop you from using bitcoin uh that
 

8877
02:30:08,240 --> 02:30:09,590
can stop you from using bitcoin uh that
can change the rules of bitcoin they

8878
02:30:09,590 --> 02:30:09,600
can change the rules of bitcoin they
 

8879
02:30:09,600 --> 02:30:13,030
can change the rules of bitcoin they
can't make more of it so it's fixed it's

8880
02:30:13,030 --> 02:30:13,040
can't make more of it so it's fixed it's
 

8881
02:30:13,040 --> 02:30:15,190
can't make more of it so it's fixed it's
available for anybody in the world it's

8882
02:30:15,190 --> 02:30:15,200
available for anybody in the world it's
 

8883
02:30:15,200 --> 02:30:17,110
available for anybody in the world it's
the hardest money ever invented

8884
02:30:17,110 --> 02:30:17,120
the hardest money ever invented
 

8885
02:30:17,120 --> 02:30:20,389
the hardest money ever invented
and it is absolutely uh i think

8886
02:30:20,389 --> 02:30:20,399
and it is absolutely uh i think
 

8887
02:30:20,399 --> 02:30:22,950
and it is absolutely uh i think
an an enormously enormously significant

8888
02:30:22,950 --> 02:30:22,960
an an enormously enormously significant
 

8889
02:30:22,960 --> 02:30:24,469
an an enormously enormously significant
invention because

8890
02:30:24,469 --> 02:30:24,479
invention because
 

8891
02:30:24,479 --> 02:30:26,790
invention because
um if you read the fiat standard and the

8892
02:30:26,790 --> 02:30:26,800
um if you read the fiat standard and the
 

8893
02:30:26,800 --> 02:30:28,550
um if you read the fiat standard and the
bitcoin standard as well

8894
02:30:28,550 --> 02:30:28,560
bitcoin standard as well
 

8895
02:30:28,560 --> 02:30:30,230
bitcoin standard as well
you'll see my perspective for why i

8896
02:30:30,230 --> 02:30:30,240
you'll see my perspective for why i
 

8897
02:30:30,240 --> 02:30:31,030
you'll see my perspective for why i
think

8898
02:30:31,030 --> 02:30:31,040
think
 

8899
02:30:31,040 --> 02:30:33,190
think
a very large number of problems on the

8900
02:30:33,190 --> 02:30:33,200
a very large number of problems on the
 

8901
02:30:33,200 --> 02:30:35,270
a very large number of problems on the
world are co in the world are caused by

8902
02:30:35,270 --> 02:30:35,280
world are co in the world are caused by
 

8903
02:30:35,280 --> 02:30:38,309
world are co in the world are caused by
easy money are caused by inflation

8904
02:30:38,309 --> 02:30:38,319
easy money are caused by inflation
 

8905
02:30:38,319 --> 02:30:39,750
easy money are caused by inflation
and

8906
02:30:39,750 --> 02:30:39,760
and
 

8907
02:30:39,760 --> 02:30:41,270
and
caused by government having access to

8908
02:30:41,270 --> 02:30:41,280
caused by government having access to
 

8909
02:30:41,280 --> 02:30:43,510
caused by government having access to
essentially an infinite uh

8910
02:30:43,510 --> 02:30:43,520
essentially an infinite uh
 

8911
02:30:43,520 --> 02:30:46,630
essentially an infinite uh
recourse to people's wealth and i think

8912
02:30:46,630 --> 02:30:46,640
recourse to people's wealth and i think
 

8913
02:30:46,640 --> 02:30:49,349
recourse to people's wealth and i think
bitcoin fixes this because it allows us

8914
02:30:49,349 --> 02:30:49,359
bitcoin fixes this because it allows us
 

8915
02:30:49,359 --> 02:30:51,270
bitcoin fixes this because it allows us
to have money

8916
02:30:51,270 --> 02:30:51,280
to have money
 

8917
02:30:51,280 --> 02:30:53,670
to have money
that has the sustainability of gold

8918
02:30:53,670 --> 02:30:53,680
that has the sustainability of gold
 

8919
02:30:53,680 --> 02:30:55,510
that has the sustainability of gold
across time meaning it holds its value

8920
02:30:55,510 --> 02:30:55,520
across time meaning it holds its value
 

8921
02:30:55,520 --> 02:30:56,710
across time meaning it holds its value
across time

8922
02:30:56,710 --> 02:30:56,720
across time
 

8923
02:30:56,720 --> 02:30:58,790
across time
like gold but much better than gold but

8924
02:30:58,790 --> 02:30:58,800
like gold but much better than gold but
 

8925
02:30:58,800 --> 02:31:01,349
like gold but much better than gold but
also it has similar to it is similar to

8926
02:31:01,349 --> 02:31:01,359
also it has similar to it is similar to
 

8927
02:31:01,359 --> 02:31:03,590
also it has similar to it is similar to
fiat and that fiat can travel quickly

8928
02:31:03,590 --> 02:31:03,600
fiat and that fiat can travel quickly
 

8929
02:31:03,600 --> 02:31:05,590
fiat and that fiat can travel quickly
but bitcoin can travel even faster than

8930
02:31:05,590 --> 02:31:05,600
but bitcoin can travel even faster than
 

8931
02:31:05,600 --> 02:31:07,030
but bitcoin can travel even faster than
fiat so

8932
02:31:07,030 --> 02:31:07,040
fiat so
 

8933
02:31:07,040 --> 02:31:09,349
fiat so
it combines

8934
02:31:09,349 --> 02:31:09,359
it combines
 

8935
02:31:09,359 --> 02:31:11,990
it combines
gold's saleability across time with fiat

8936
02:31:11,990 --> 02:31:12,000
gold's saleability across time with fiat
 

8937
02:31:12,000 --> 02:31:14,630

02:31:17,030 --> 02:31:17,040
immutable package that nobody can change
 

8941
02:31:17,040 --> 02:31:18,630
immutable package that nobody can change
and nobody can control can you define

8942
02:31:18,630 --> 02:31:18,640
and nobody can control can you define
 

8943
02:31:18,640 --> 02:31:21,349

a good to be sold easily on the market
 

8951
02:31:28,399 --> 02:31:30,150
a good to be sold easily on the market
specifically to be sold without much

specifically to be sold without much
 

8953
02:31:30,160 --> 02:31:32,630
specifically to be sold without much
loss in its value so houses are great

8954
02:31:32,630 --> 02:31:32,640
loss in its value so houses are great
 

8955
02:31:32,640 --> 02:31:34,309
loss in its value so houses are great
for living in but they're not very

8956
02:31:34,309 --> 02:31:34,319
for living in but they're not very

you can just click a button and sell a
 

8961
02:31:38,080 --> 02:31:40,230
you can just click a button and sell a
house and have a giant market of people

8962
02:31:40,230 --> 02:31:40,240
house and have a giant market of people
 

8963
02:31:40,240 --> 02:31:43,670
house and have a giant market of people
buying houses from you you need to find

8964
02:31:43,670 --> 02:31:43,680
buying houses from you you need to find
 

8965
02:31:43,680 --> 02:31:45,190
buying houses from you you need to find
um you need to find somebody who wants

8966
02:31:45,190 --> 02:31:45,200
um you need to find somebody who wants
 

8967
02:31:45,200 --> 02:31:46,710
um you need to find somebody who wants
the exact house that you have with the

8968
02:31:46,710 --> 02:31:46,720
the exact house that you have with the
 

8969
02:31:46,720 --> 02:31:48,790
the exact house that you have with the
exact specifications that you have and

8970
02:31:48,790 --> 02:31:48,800
exact specifications that you have and
 

8971
02:31:48,800 --> 02:31:49,830
exact specifications that you have and
because you know houses are not

8972
02:31:49,830 --> 02:31:49,840
because you know houses are not
 

8973
02:31:49,840 --> 02:31:51,990
because you know houses are not
identical there's no liquid giant market

8974
02:31:51,990 --> 02:31:52,000
identical there's no liquid giant market
 

8975
02:31:52,000 --> 02:31:53,910
identical there's no liquid giant market
for people to just buy and sell

8976
02:31:53,910 --> 02:31:53,920
for people to just buy and sell
 

8977
02:31:53,920 --> 02:31:56,389
for people to just buy and sell
identical houses from

8978
02:31:56,389 --> 02:31:56,399
identical houses from
 

8979
02:31:56,399 --> 02:31:57,270
identical houses from
so

8980
02:31:57,270 --> 02:31:57,280
so
 

8981
02:31:57,280 --> 02:31:59,349
so
gold for instance has a

8982
02:31:59,349 --> 02:31:59,359
gold for instance has a
 

8983
02:31:59,359 --> 02:32:01,510
gold for instance has a
good salability as money

8984
02:32:01,510 --> 02:32:01,520
good salability as money
 

8985
02:32:01,520 --> 02:32:03,830
good salability as money
because it's a liquid good it's uniform

8986
02:32:03,830 --> 02:32:03,840
because it's a liquid good it's uniform
 

8987
02:32:03,840 --> 02:32:05,910
because it's a liquid good it's uniform
and people are always buying it

8988
02:32:05,910 --> 02:32:05,920
and people are always buying it
 

8989
02:32:05,920 --> 02:32:08,070
and people are always buying it
fiat dollars have great sellability

8990
02:32:08,070 --> 02:32:08,080
fiat dollars have great sellability
 

8991
02:32:08,080 --> 02:32:09,830
fiat dollars have great sellability
because everybody's always buying and

8992
02:32:09,830 --> 02:32:09,840
because everybody's always buying and
 

8993
02:32:09,840 --> 02:32:11,990
because everybody's always buying and
exchanging dollars for other goods so if

8994
02:32:11,990 --> 02:32:12,000
exchanging dollars for other goods so if
 

8995
02:32:12,000 --> 02:32:13,670
exchanging dollars for other goods so if
you have a hundred dollar bill

8996
02:32:13,670 --> 02:32:13,680
you have a hundred dollar bill
 

8997
02:32:13,680 --> 02:32:15,590
you have a hundred dollar bill
you can easily get rid of it and you'll

8998
02:32:15,590 --> 02:32:15,600
you can easily get rid of it and you'll
 

8999
02:32:15,600 --> 02:32:17,270
you can easily get rid of it and you'll
get a hundred dollars worth of stuff for

9000
02:32:17,270 --> 02:32:17,280
get a hundred dollars worth of stuff for
 

9001
02:32:17,280 --> 02:32:19,750
get a hundred dollars worth of stuff for
it if you have a hundred dollars worth

9002
02:32:19,750 --> 02:32:19,760
it if you have a hundred dollars worth
 

9003
02:32:19,760 --> 02:32:21,910
it if you have a hundred dollars worth
of stuff it's harder to get rid of it if

9004
02:32:21,910 --> 02:32:21,920
of stuff it's harder to get rid of it if
 

9005
02:32:21,920 --> 02:32:24,389
of stuff it's harder to get rid of it if
you have 100 worth of phone

9006
02:32:24,389 --> 02:32:24,399
you have 100 worth of phone
 

9007
02:32:24,399 --> 02:32:25,830
you have 100 worth of phone
it's not as easy to spend it as a

9008
02:32:25,830 --> 02:32:25,840
it's not as easy to spend it as a
 

9009
02:32:25,840 --> 02:32:28,389
it's not as easy to spend it as a
hundred dollar bill that's scalability

9010
02:32:28,389 --> 02:32:28,399
hundred dollar bill that's scalability
 

9011
02:32:28,399 --> 02:32:30,950
hundred dollar bill that's scalability
what do you mean that bitcoin i

9012
02:32:30,950 --> 02:32:30,960
what do you mean that bitcoin i
 

9013
02:32:30,960 --> 02:32:32,630

understand that bitcoin has the
sellability of gold across time

9016
02:32:35,190 --> 02:32:35,200
sellability of gold across time
 

9017
02:32:35,200 --> 02:32:37,590
sellability of gold across time
better even yeah better yes like on the

9018
02:32:37,590 --> 02:32:37,600
better even yeah better yes like on the
 

9019
02:32:37,600 --> 02:32:40,230
better even yeah better yes like on the
order or whatever um and then and then

order or whatever um and then and then
 

9021
02:32:40,240 --> 02:32:42,710
order or whatever um and then and then
has the syllabity of fiat across space

9022
02:32:42,710 --> 02:32:42,720
has the syllabity of fiat across space
 

9023
02:32:42,720 --> 02:32:44,150
has the syllabity of fiat across space
what does that mean so if you remember

9024
02:32:44,150 --> 02:32:44,160
what does that mean so if you remember
 

9025
02:32:44,160 --> 02:32:45,590
what does that mean so if you remember
when you asked me what is the advantage

when you asked me what is the advantage
 

9027
02:32:45,600 --> 02:32:47,590
when you asked me what is the advantage
of fiat what does the um advantage

9028
02:32:47,590 --> 02:32:47,600
of fiat what does the um advantage
 

9029
02:32:47,600 --> 02:32:49,590
of fiat what does the um advantage
offers us it's cheaper to move fiat

9030
02:32:49,590 --> 02:32:49,600
offers us it's cheaper to move fiat
 

9031
02:32:49,600 --> 02:32:52,150
offers us it's cheaper to move fiat
across space than it is to move gold you

9032
02:32:52,150 --> 02:32:52,160
across space than it is to move gold you
 

9033

bitcoin improves on that is that with

9058
02:33:18,070 --> 02:33:18,080
bitcoin improves on that is that with
 

9059
02:33:18,080 --> 02:33:19,429
bitcoin improves on that is that with
bitcoin you're actually selling you're

9060
02:33:19,429 --> 02:33:19,439
bitcoin you're actually selling you're
 

9061
02:33:19,439 --> 02:33:21,590
bitcoin you're actually selling you're
you're sending final settlement in a

9062
02:33:21,590 --> 02:33:21,600
you're sending final settlement in a
 

9063
02:33:21,600 --> 02:33:22,790
you're sending final settlement in a
couple of hours

couple of hours
 

9065
02:33:22,800 --> 02:33:24,309
couple of hours
so you send the bitcoin transaction you

9066
02:33:24,309 --> 02:33:24,319
so you send the bitcoin transaction you
 

9067
02:33:24,319 --> 02:33:26,550
so you send the bitcoin transaction you
get six confirmations in an hour you get

9068
02:33:26,550 --> 02:33:26,560
get six confirmations in an hour you get
 

9069
02:33:26,560 --> 02:33:28,790
get six confirmations in an hour you get
about 12 confirmations in two hours on

9070
02:33:28,790 --> 02:33:28,800
about 12 confirmations in two hours on
 

9071
02:33:28,800 --> 02:33:31,110
about 12 confirmations in two hours on
average with 12 confirmations you know

9072

average with 12 confirmations you know
 

9073
02:33:31,120 --> 02:33:35,349
average with 12 confirmations you know
you're pretty um definitely clearly safe

9074
02:33:35,349 --> 02:33:35,359
you're pretty um definitely clearly safe
 

9075
02:33:35,359 --> 02:33:36,469
you're pretty um definitely clearly safe
on this

on this
so

9078
02:33:37,270 --> 02:33:37,280
so
 

9079
02:33:37,280 --> 02:33:38,710
so
within a couple of hours you could send

9080
02:33:38,710 --> 02:33:38,720
within a couple of hours you could send
 

9081
02:33:38,720 --> 02:33:41,030
within a couple of hours you could send
a billion dollars across the ocean

9082
02:33:41,030 --> 02:33:41,040
a billion dollars across the ocean
 

9083
02:33:41,040 --> 02:33:42,469
a billion dollars across the ocean
and

9084
02:33:42,469 --> 02:33:42,479
and
 

9085
02:33:42,479 --> 02:33:44,309
and
have final settlement on them it's not

9086
02:33:44,309 --> 02:33:44,319
have final settlement on them it's not
 

9087
02:33:44,319 --> 02:33:45,990
have final settlement on them it's not
just that you've sent a credit

9088
02:33:45,990 --> 02:33:46,000
just that you've sent a credit
 

9089
02:33:46,000 --> 02:33:47,670
just that you've sent a credit
obligation that's going to need weeks

9090
02:33:47,670 --> 02:33:47,680
obligation that's going to need weeks
 

9091
02:33:47,680 --> 02:33:49,510
obligation that's going to need weeks
and months to settle which is the case

9092
02:33:49,510 --> 02:33:49,520
and months to settle which is the case
 

9093
02:33:49,520 --> 02:33:50,950
and months to settle which is the case
with fiat

9094
02:33:50,950 --> 02:33:50,960
with fiat
 

9095
02:33:50,960 --> 02:33:51,990
with fiat
so it is

9096
02:33:51,990 --> 02:33:52,000
so it is
 

9097
02:33:52,000 --> 02:33:54,389
so it is
faster than fiat effectively so it's

9098
02:33:54,389 --> 02:33:54,399
faster than fiat effectively so it's
 

9099
02:33:54,399 --> 02:33:56,790
faster than fiat effectively so it's
harder than gold and faster than fiat

9100
02:33:56,790 --> 02:33:56,800
harder than gold and faster than fiat
 

9101
02:33:56,800 --> 02:34:00,230
harder than gold and faster than fiat
that's a good way of putting it

9102
02:34:00,230 --> 02:34:00,240
that's a good way of putting it
 

9103
02:34:00,240 --> 02:34:02,550
that's a good way of putting it
one other aspect of bitcoin

9104
02:34:02,550 --> 02:34:02,560
one other aspect of bitcoin
 

9105
02:34:02,560 --> 02:34:03,910
one other aspect of bitcoin
i have to ask

9106
02:34:03,910 --> 02:34:03,920
i have to ask
 

9107
02:34:03,920 --> 02:34:06,630
i have to ask
to me and the human level is fascinating

9108
02:34:06,630 --> 02:34:06,640
to me and the human level is fascinating
 

9109
02:34:06,640 --> 02:34:09,750
to me and the human level is fascinating
is it was founded by satoshi nakamoto an

9110
02:34:09,750 --> 02:34:09,760
is it was founded by satoshi nakamoto an
 

9111
02:34:09,760 --> 02:34:11,990
is it was founded by satoshi nakamoto an
anonymous founder there's no leader

9112
02:34:11,990 --> 02:34:12,000
anonymous founder there's no leader
 

9113
02:34:12,000 --> 02:34:13,830
anonymous founder there's no leader
so that's another aspect of the

9114
02:34:13,830 --> 02:34:13,840
so that's another aspect of the
 

9115
02:34:13,840 --> 02:34:17,110
so that's another aspect of the
decentralization it's leaderless yeah

9116
02:34:17,110 --> 02:34:17,120
decentralization it's leaderless yeah
 

9117
02:34:17,120 --> 02:34:19,510
decentralization it's leaderless yeah
so unfortunately it's not a monarchy

9118
02:34:19,510 --> 02:34:19,520
so unfortunately it's not a monarchy
 

9119
02:34:19,520 --> 02:34:22,150
so unfortunately it's not a monarchy
fortunately or fortunately yes

9120

fortunately or fortunately yes
 

9121
02:34:22,160 --> 02:34:24,710
fortunately or fortunately yes
who is satoshi nakamoto do you think and

it definitely is not me
 

9127
02:34:28,720 --> 02:34:30,790
it definitely is not me
um i don't know who it is if it was

9128
02:34:30,790 --> 02:34:30,800
um i don't know who it is if it was
 

9129
02:34:30,800 --> 02:34:33,030
um i don't know who it is if it was
would you tell me

9130
02:34:33,030 --> 02:34:33,040
would you tell me
 

9131
02:34:33,040 --> 02:34:35,110
would you tell me
that's a trick question i know great

9132
02:34:35,110 --> 02:34:35,120
that's a trick question i know great
 

9133
02:34:35,120 --> 02:34:36,550
that's a trick question i know great
question but i mean everybody who knows

9134
02:34:36,550 --> 02:34:36,560
question but i mean everybody who knows
 

9135
02:34:36,560 --> 02:34:38,870
question but i mean everybody who knows
me knows i can't really code so

9136
02:34:38,870 --> 02:34:38,880
me knows i can't really code so
 

9137
02:34:38,880 --> 02:34:42,230
me knows i can't really code so
uh you would say that even if you could

9138
02:34:42,230 --> 02:34:42,240
uh you would say that even if you could
 

9139
02:34:42,240 --> 02:34:43,990
uh you would say that even if you could
but that's true do you think it's one

9140
02:34:43,990 --> 02:34:44,000
but that's true do you think it's one
 

9141
02:34:44,000 --> 02:34:45,510
but that's true do you think it's one
person do you think it's multiple people

9142
02:34:45,510 --> 02:34:45,520
person do you think it's multiple people
 

9143
02:34:45,520 --> 02:34:47,190
person do you think it's multiple people
is it interesting to you do you think

9144
02:34:47,190 --> 02:34:47,200
is it interesting to you do you think
 

9145
02:34:47,200 --> 02:34:49,750
is it interesting to you do you think
it's fundamental to the coin itself to

9146
02:34:49,750 --> 02:34:49,760
it's fundamental to the coin itself to
 

9147
02:34:49,760 --> 02:34:51,429
it's fundamental to the coin itself to
not the coin the

9148
02:34:51,429 --> 02:34:51,439
not the coin the
 

9149
02:34:51,439 --> 02:34:53,510
not the coin the
the entirety of the concept

9150
02:34:53,510 --> 02:34:53,520
the entirety of the concept
 

9151
02:34:53,520 --> 02:34:56,469
the entirety of the concept
um that its founders and animus and how

9152
02:34:56,469 --> 02:34:56,479
um that its founders and animus and how
 

9153
02:34:56,479 --> 02:34:58,870
um that its founders and animus and how
much guts do you think it takes if it's

9154
02:34:58,870 --> 02:34:58,880
much guts do you think it takes if it's
 

9155
02:34:58,880 --> 02:35:01,030
much guts do you think it takes if it's
one person just walk away from so much

9156
02:35:01,030 --> 02:35:01,040
one person just walk away from so much
 

9157
02:35:01,040 --> 02:35:02,230
one person just walk away from so much
money

9158
02:35:02,230 --> 02:35:02,240
money
 

9159
02:35:02,240 --> 02:35:04,150
money
i've considered all these questions many

9160
02:35:04,150 --> 02:35:04,160
i've considered all these questions many
 

9161
02:35:04,160 --> 02:35:06,790
i've considered all these questions many
times it's very hard to formulate um a

9162
02:35:06,790 --> 02:35:06,800
times it's very hard to formulate um a
 

9163
02:35:06,800 --> 02:35:08,950
times it's very hard to formulate um a
definitive answer to all of them

9164
02:35:08,950 --> 02:35:08,960
definitive answer to all of them
 

9165
02:35:08,960 --> 02:35:10,870
definitive answer to all of them
i don't know who it is and i don't know

9166
02:35:10,870 --> 02:35:10,880
i don't know who it is and i don't know
 

9167
02:35:10,880 --> 02:35:13,190
i don't know who it is and i don't know
um why

9168
02:35:13,190 --> 02:35:13,200
um why
 

9169
02:35:13,200 --> 02:35:15,590
um why
he or them or she

9170
02:35:15,590 --> 02:35:15,600
he or them or she
 

9171
02:35:15,600 --> 02:35:17,990
he or them or she
are not spending the coins that they

9172
02:35:17,990 --> 02:35:18,000
are not spending the coins that they
 

9173
02:35:18,000 --> 02:35:19,750
are not spending the coins that they
most likely have

9174
02:35:19,750 --> 02:35:19,760
most likely have
 

9175
02:35:19,760 --> 02:35:21,510
most likely have
i think what really matters

9176
02:35:21,510 --> 02:35:21,520
i think what really matters
 

9177
02:35:21,520 --> 02:35:23,270
i think what really matters
in bitcoin about satoshi is the fact

9178
02:35:23,270 --> 02:35:23,280
in bitcoin about satoshi is the fact
 

9179
02:35:23,280 --> 02:35:24,870
in bitcoin about satoshi is the fact
that he's not there

that he's not there
 

9181
02:35:24,880 --> 02:35:26,710
that he's not there
and this is what's truly astonishing

9182
02:35:26,710 --> 02:35:26,720
and this is what's truly astonishing
 

9183
02:35:26,720 --> 02:35:28,550
and this is what's truly astonishing
about it the fact the most important

9184
02:35:28,550 --> 02:35:28,560
about it the fact the most important
 

9185
02:35:28,560 --> 02:35:30,309
about it the fact the most important
fact in bitcoin is the fact that the

9186
02:35:30,309 --> 02:35:30,319
fact in bitcoin is the fact that the
 

9187
02:35:30,319 --> 02:35:32,150
fact in bitcoin is the fact that the
creators disappeared and the thing has

9188
02:35:32,150 --> 02:35:32,160
creators disappeared and the thing has
 

9189
02:35:32,160 --> 02:35:34,070
creators disappeared and the thing has
continued to operate now for almost 12

9190
02:35:34,070 --> 02:35:34,080
continued to operate now for almost 12
 

9191
02:35:34,080 --> 02:35:36,070
continued to operate now for almost 12
years without him being there or 11

9192
02:35:36,070 --> 02:35:36,080
years without him being there or 11
 

9193
02:35:36,080 --> 02:35:38,710
years without him being there or 11
years i think it's been since he's left

9194
02:35:38,710 --> 02:35:38,720
years i think it's been since he's left
 

9195
02:35:38,720 --> 02:35:40,309
years i think it's been since he's left
and this this is really the most

9196
02:35:40,309 --> 02:35:40,319
and this this is really the most
 

9197
02:35:40,319 --> 02:35:43,110
and this this is really the most
important thing and you know maybe maybe

9198
02:35:43,110 --> 02:35:43,120
important thing and you know maybe maybe
 

9199
02:35:43,120 --> 02:35:45,510
important thing and you know maybe maybe
he died or she died or they

02:36:04,550 --> 02:36:04,560
given us this very vital
 

9215
02:36:04,560 --> 02:36:07,270
given us this very vital
very very very vital building ingredient

9216
02:36:07,270 --> 02:36:07,280
very very very vital building ingredient
 

9217
02:36:07,280 --> 02:36:08,790
very very very vital building ingredient
in bitcoin which

9218
02:36:08,790 --> 02:36:08,800
in bitcoin which
 

9219
02:36:08,800 --> 02:36:10,309
in bitcoin which
no other digital currency would ever

9220
02:36:10,309 --> 02:36:10,319
no other digital currency would ever
 

9221
02:36:10,319 --> 02:36:12,469
no other digital currency would ever
recreate which is that

9222
02:36:12,469 --> 02:36:12,479
recreate which is that
 

9223
02:36:12,479 --> 02:36:14,630
recreate which is that
you know because it was the first

9224
02:36:14,630 --> 02:36:14,640
you know because it was the first
 

9225
02:36:14,640 --> 02:36:16,790
you know because it was the first
it was the one that was able to um

9226
02:36:16,790 --> 02:36:16,800
it was the one that was able to um
 

9227
02:36:16,800 --> 02:36:18,550
it was the one that was able to um
establish the first mover advantage and

9228
02:36:18,550 --> 02:36:18,560
establish the first mover advantage and
 

9229
02:36:18,560 --> 02:36:20,070
establish the first mover advantage and
get all the people who are interested in

9230
02:36:20,070 --> 02:36:20,080
get all the people who are interested in
 

9231
02:36:20,080 --> 02:36:22,469
get all the people who are interested in
the technology to get into it and so

9232
02:36:22,469 --> 02:36:22,479
the technology to get into it and so
 

9233
02:36:22,479 --> 02:36:24,469
the technology to get into it and so
that's an enormous advantage but

9234
02:36:24,469 --> 02:36:24,479
that's an enormous advantage but
 

9235
02:36:24,479 --> 02:36:26,389
that's an enormous advantage but
you know the the the

9236
02:36:26,389 --> 02:36:26,399
you know the the the
 

9237
02:36:26,399 --> 02:36:28,469
you know the the the
cherry on top or what made the whole

9238
02:36:28,469 --> 02:36:28,479
cherry on top or what made the whole
 

9239
02:36:28,479 --> 02:36:31,830
cherry on top or what made the whole
thing really function well is the fact

9240
02:36:31,830 --> 02:36:31,840
thing really function well is the fact
 

9241
02:36:31,840 --> 02:36:33,830
thing really function well is the fact
that the guy who made it disappeared

9242
02:36:33,830 --> 02:36:33,840
that the guy who made it disappeared
 

9243
02:36:33,840 --> 02:36:35,670
that the guy who made it disappeared
and that it continued to operate which

9244
02:36:35,670 --> 02:36:35,680
and that it continued to operate which
 

9245
02:36:35,680 --> 02:36:37,830
and that it continued to operate which
is just a clear illustration that this

9246
02:36:37,830 --> 02:36:37,840
is just a clear illustration that this
 

9247
02:36:37,840 --> 02:36:39,830
is just a clear illustration that this
is a network with no admins

9248
02:36:39,830 --> 02:36:39,840
is a network with no admins
 

9249
02:36:39,840 --> 02:36:41,590
is a network with no admins
and i'm tempted to think that they're

9250
02:36:41,590 --> 02:36:41,600
and i'm tempted to think that they're
 

9251
02:36:41,600 --> 02:36:43,670
and i'm tempted to think that they're
incapacitated in some way probably dead

9252
02:36:43,670 --> 02:36:43,680
incapacitated in some way probably dead
 

9253
02:36:43,680 --> 02:36:45,590
incapacitated in some way probably dead
or gone because i

9254
02:36:45,590 --> 02:36:45,600
or gone because i
 

9255
02:36:45,600 --> 02:36:47,349
or gone because i
i can't believe

9256
02:36:47,349 --> 02:36:47,359
i can't believe
 

9257
02:36:47,359 --> 02:36:48,389
i can't believe
the

9258
02:36:48,389 --> 02:36:48,399
the
 

9259
02:36:48,399 --> 02:36:50,230
the
i don't believe any human being would

9260
02:36:50,230 --> 02:36:50,240
i don't believe any human being would
 

9261
02:36:50,240 --> 02:36:51,270
i don't believe any human being would
have this

9262
02:36:51,270 --> 02:36:51,280
have this
 

9263
02:36:51,280 --> 02:36:53,429
have this
level of self-control to not

9264
02:36:53,429 --> 02:36:53,439
level of self-control to not
 

9265
02:36:53,439 --> 02:36:56,070
level of self-control to not
get into not want to meddle with their

9266
02:36:56,070 --> 02:36:56,080
get into not want to meddle with their
 

9267
02:36:56,080 --> 02:36:58,870
get into not want to meddle with their
invention uh so much um

9268
02:36:58,870 --> 02:36:58,880
invention uh so much um
 

9269
02:36:58,880 --> 02:37:00,870
invention uh so much um
even even if they you know they might

9270
02:37:00,870 --> 02:37:00,880
even even if they you know they might
 

9271
02:37:00,880 --> 02:37:02,309
even even if they you know they might
have had the self-control to like mine

9272
02:37:02,309 --> 02:37:02,319
have had the self-control to like mine
 

9273
02:37:02,319 --> 02:37:03,590
have had the self-control to like mine
the first million coins to get the

9274
02:37:03,590 --> 02:37:03,600
the first million coins to get the
 

9275
02:37:03,600 --> 02:37:04,950
the first million coins to get the
network going and then throw away the

9276
02:37:04,950 --> 02:37:04,960
network going and then throw away the
 

9277
02:37:04,960 --> 02:37:07,030
network going and then throw away the
coins on or send them to an address that

9278
02:37:07,030 --> 02:37:07,040
coins on or send them to an address that
 

9279
02:37:07,040 --> 02:37:09,670
coins on or send them to an address that
they don't have the key to

9280
02:37:09,670 --> 02:37:09,680
they don't have the key to
 

9281
02:37:09,680 --> 02:37:11,110
they don't have the key to
um because they really just wanted the

9282
02:37:11,110 --> 02:37:11,120
um because they really just wanted the
 

9283
02:37:11,120 --> 02:37:13,110
um because they really just wanted the
network to take off they may have no

9284
02:37:13,110 --> 02:37:13,120
network to take off they may have no
 

9285
02:37:13,120 --> 02:37:14,550
network to take off they may have no
access to the coins and that's why they

9286
02:37:14,550 --> 02:37:14,560
access to the coins and that's why they
 

9287
02:37:14,560 --> 02:37:16,150
access to the coins and that's why they
can't move them i could see that

9288
02:37:16,150 --> 02:37:16,160
can't move them i could see that
 

9289
02:37:16,160 --> 02:37:17,830
can't move them i could see that
happening but i find it harder to

9290
02:37:17,830 --> 02:37:17,840
happening but i find it harder to
 

9291
02:37:17,840 --> 02:37:19,670
happening but i find it harder to
believe that they would resist the

9292
02:37:19,670 --> 02:37:19,680
believe that they would resist the
 

9293
02:37:19,680 --> 02:37:21,830
believe that they would resist the
temptation to mess with the network you

9294
02:37:21,830 --> 02:37:21,840
temptation to mess with the network you
 

9295
02:37:21,840 --> 02:37:24,309
temptation to mess with the network you
know it's funny i find that the founders

9296
02:37:24,309 --> 02:37:24,319
know it's funny i find that the founders
 

9297
02:37:24,319 --> 02:37:26,790
know it's funny i find that the founders
of ideas are often

9298
02:37:26,790 --> 02:37:26,800
of ideas are often
 

9299
02:37:26,800 --> 02:37:29,510
of ideas are often
principled and have the integrity

9300
02:37:29,510 --> 02:37:29,520
principled and have the integrity
 

9301
02:37:29,520 --> 02:37:32,790
principled and have the integrity
that the eventual users of those ideas

9302
02:37:32,790 --> 02:37:32,800
that the eventual users of those ideas
 

9303
02:37:32,800 --> 02:37:33,590
that the eventual users of those ideas
uh

9304
02:37:33,590 --> 02:37:33,600
uh
 

9305
02:37:33,600 --> 02:37:35,429
uh

02:37:35,429 --> 02:37:35,439
don't fully have

02:37:35,439 --> 02:37:37,349
don't fully have
i i tend to you know we have the kind of

9308
02:37:37,349 --> 02:37:37,359
i i tend to you know we have the kind of
 

9309
02:37:37,359 --> 02:37:39,670
i i tend to you know we have the kind of
cynical view power corrupts absolute

9310
02:37:39,670 --> 02:37:39,680
cynical view power corrupts absolute
 

9311
02:37:39,680 --> 02:37:41,910
cynical view power corrupts absolute
power corrupts absolutely and we tend to

9312
02:37:41,910 --> 02:37:41,920
power corrupts absolutely and we tend to
 

9313
02:37:41,920 --> 02:37:43,990
power corrupts absolutely and we tend to
in our mind generalize that all humans

9314
02:37:43,990 --> 02:37:44,000
in our mind generalize that all humans
 

9315
02:37:44,000 --> 02:37:45,510
in our mind generalize that all humans
are corruptable

9316
02:37:45,510 --> 02:37:45,520
are corruptable
 

9317
02:37:45,520 --> 02:37:47,510
are corruptable
and perhaps that's true to some degree

9318
02:37:47,510 --> 02:37:47,520
and perhaps that's true to some degree
 

9319
02:37:47,520 --> 02:37:49,349
and perhaps that's true to some degree
but i think some people are more

9320
02:37:49,349 --> 02:37:49,359
but i think some people are more
 

9321
02:37:49,359 --> 02:37:51,030
but i think some people are more
corruptable than others

9322
02:37:51,030 --> 02:37:51,040
corruptable than others
 

9323
02:37:51,040 --> 02:37:53,670
corruptable than others
and i find that there is i mean this i

9324
02:37:53,670 --> 02:37:53,680
and i find that there is i mean this i
 

9325
02:37:53,680 --> 02:37:54,950
and i find that there is i mean this i
like to think

9326
02:37:54,950 --> 02:37:54,960
like to think
 

9327
02:37:54,960 --> 02:37:57,910
like to think
that uh satoshi nakamoto is out there

9328
02:37:57,910 --> 02:37:57,920
that uh satoshi nakamoto is out there
 

9329
02:37:57,920 --> 02:37:58,710
that uh satoshi nakamoto is out there
and

9330
02:37:58,710 --> 02:37:58,720
and
 

9331
02:37:58,720 --> 02:38:00,550
and
uh you know just like george washington

9332
02:38:00,550 --> 02:38:00,560
uh you know just like george washington
 

9333
02:38:00,560 --> 02:38:03,270
uh you know just like george washington
chose to walk away and it's a principle

9334
02:38:03,270 --> 02:38:03,280
chose to walk away and it's a principle
 

9335
02:38:03,280 --> 02:38:06,309
chose to walk away and it's a principle
and the principle is more powerful than

9336
02:38:06,309 --> 02:38:06,319
and the principle is more powerful than
 

9337
02:38:06,319 --> 02:38:07,990
and the principle is more powerful than
the financial reward or any of those

9338
02:38:07,990 --> 02:38:08,000
the financial reward or any of those
 

9339
02:38:08,000 --> 02:38:10,070
the financial reward or any of those
kinds of things

9340
02:38:10,070 --> 02:38:10,080
kinds of things
 

9341
02:38:10,080 --> 02:38:12,230
kinds of things
it's a principle that stands for freedom

9342
02:38:12,230 --> 02:38:12,240
it's a principle that stands for freedom
 

9343
02:38:12,240 --> 02:38:13,429
it's a principle that stands for freedom
and there's a lot of people throughout

9344
02:38:13,429 --> 02:38:13,439
and there's a lot of people throughout
 

9345
02:38:13,439 --> 02:38:15,030
and there's a lot of people throughout
history even recent history that are

9346
02:38:15,030 --> 02:38:15,040
history even recent history that are
 

9347
02:38:15,040 --> 02:38:17,990
history even recent history that are
willing to die for these principles

9348
02:38:17,990 --> 02:38:18,000
willing to die for these principles
 

9349
02:38:18,000 --> 02:38:21,110
willing to die for these principles
or live a life

9350
02:38:21,110 --> 02:38:21,120
or live a life
 

9351
02:38:21,120 --> 02:38:23,670
or live a life
full of suffering and sacrifice because

9352
02:38:23,670 --> 02:38:23,680
full of suffering and sacrifice because
 

9353
02:38:23,680 --> 02:38:26,230
full of suffering and sacrifice because
they're still living a life

9354
02:38:26,230 --> 02:38:26,240
they're still living a life
 

9355
02:38:26,240 --> 02:38:28,230
they're still living a life
of principle and choosing that day after

9356
02:38:28,230 --> 02:38:28,240
of principle and choosing that day after
 

9357
02:38:28,240 --> 02:38:30,950
of principle and choosing that day after
day after day so um i mean there's power

9358
02:38:30,950 --> 02:38:30,960
day after day so um i mean there's power
 

9359
02:38:30,960 --> 02:38:32,950
day after day so um i mean there's power
to that money what's what's the worth of

9360
02:38:32,950 --> 02:38:32,960
to that money what's what's the worth of
 

9361
02:38:32,960 --> 02:38:34,550
to that money what's what's the worth of
money in the end

9362
02:38:34,550 --> 02:38:34,560
money in the end
 

9363
02:38:34,560 --> 02:38:37,030
money in the end
uh in terms of just personal financial

9364
02:38:37,030 --> 02:38:37,040
uh in terms of just personal financial
 

9365
02:38:37,040 --> 02:38:37,910
uh in terms of just personal financial
gain

9366
02:38:37,910 --> 02:38:37,920

9367
02:38:37,920 --> 02:38:38,950

um

9370
02:38:39,990 --> 02:38:40,000
um
 

9371
02:38:40,000 --> 02:38:42,309
um
knowing how much positive impact there

9372
02:38:42,309 --> 02:38:42,319
knowing how much positive impact there
 

9373
02:38:42,319 --> 02:38:43,270
knowing how much positive impact there
is

9374
02:38:43,270 --> 02:38:43,280
is
 

9375
02:38:43,280 --> 02:38:45,510
is
so the person that chooses to walk away

9376
02:38:45,510 --> 02:38:45,520
so the person that chooses to walk away
 

9377
02:38:45,520 --> 02:38:47,110
so the person that chooses to walk away
like that i think is the same kind of

9378
02:38:47,110 --> 02:38:47,120
like that i think is the same kind of
 

9379
02:38:47,120 --> 02:38:49,670
like that i think is the same kind of
person that chooses to live

um
 

9383
02:38:51,280 --> 02:38:52,630
um
live by that principle you have you have

9384
02:38:52,630 --> 02:38:52,640
live by that principle you have you have
 

9385
02:38:52,640 --> 02:38:55,110
live by that principle you have you have
people like that you know in uh

know when people talk about bitcoin in
the cryptocurrency space

9406
02:39:14,950 --> 02:39:14,960
the cryptocurrency space
 

9407
02:39:14,960 --> 02:39:17,590

it's often mixed up
 

9409
02:39:17,600 --> 02:39:19,270

ideas
 

9415
02:39:21,840 --> 02:39:24,950
ideas
and i think there's often correlated but

and i think there's often correlated but
 

9417
02:39:24,960 --> 02:39:27,429

on the street the other day
 

9427

02:39:43,670 --> 02:39:43,680
that's correlated but it's it is
 

9433
02:39:43,680 --> 02:39:45,910
that's correlated but it's it is
distinct from the power of the idea to

9434
02:39:45,910 --> 02:39:45,920
distinct from the power of the idea to
 

9435
02:39:45,920 --> 02:39:48,070
distinct from the power of the idea to
change a world uh to change the world

9436

like alex gladstein in the case of
 

9441
02:39:51,920 --> 02:39:54,070
like alex gladstein in the case of
bitcoin that decreased the amount of

9442
02:39:54,070 --> 02:39:54,080
bitcoin that decreased the amount of
 

9443
02:39:54,080 --> 02:39:55,590
bitcoin that decreased the amount of
suffering in the world because of the

suffering in the world because of the
 

9445
02:39:55,600 --> 02:39:58,070
suffering in the world because of the
authoritarian regimes and just because

9451
02:40:03,040 --> 02:40:06,070
gambling feeling of like yes yes this is
good uh and i mean short short-term

up that's more like investment and so on
 

9457
02:40:10,640 --> 02:40:12,070
up that's more like investment and so on
and there's a short time that will go up

9458
02:40:12,070 --> 02:40:12,080
and there's a short time that will go up
 

9459
02:40:12,080 --> 02:40:14,469
and there's a short time that will go up
just a good feeling that you can't you

9460
02:40:14,469 --> 02:40:14,479
just a good feeling that you can't you
 

9461
02:40:14,479 --> 02:40:16,630
just a good feeling that you can't you
have to in your mind keep those distinct

9462
02:40:16,630 --> 02:40:16,640
have to in your mind keep those distinct
 

9463
02:40:16,640 --> 02:40:18,469

from um
 

9465
02:40:18,479 --> 02:40:20,469
from um
from the power of the idea to transform

9466
02:40:20,469 --> 02:40:20,479
from the power of the idea to transform
 

9467
02:40:20,479 --> 02:40:22,389
from the power of the idea to transform
the world and if you focus on the power

9468
02:40:22,389 --> 02:40:22,399
the world and if you focus on the power
 

9469
02:40:22,399 --> 02:40:24,230
the world and if you focus on the power
of the idea

9470
02:40:24,230 --> 02:40:24,240
of the idea
 

9471
02:40:24,240 --> 02:40:25,030
of the idea
maybe

9472
02:40:25,030 --> 02:40:25,040
maybe
 

9473
02:40:25,040 --> 02:40:26,870
maybe
a billion or billions of dollars don't

9474
02:40:26,870 --> 02:40:26,880
a billion or billions of dollars don't
 

9475
02:40:26,880 --> 02:40:28,630
a billion or billions of dollars don't
matter as much

9476
02:40:28,630 --> 02:40:28,640
matter as much
 

9477
02:40:28,640 --> 02:40:29,830
matter as much
at least that's what i would like to

9478
02:40:29,830 --> 02:40:29,840
at least that's what i would like to
 

9479
02:40:29,840 --> 02:40:31,750
at least that's what i would like to
believe perhaps but what matters

9480
02:40:31,750 --> 02:40:31,760
believe perhaps but what matters
 

9481

dogecoin but i might be misremembering
 

9557
02:41:38,080 --> 02:41:40,469
dogecoin but i might be misremembering
you are misremembering okay i need to

9558
02:41:40,469 --> 02:41:40,479
you are misremembering okay i need to
 

9559

you are misremembering okay i need to
maybe i'm quoting him out of context yes

9560
02:41:42,830 --> 02:41:42,840
maybe i'm quoting him out of context yes
 

9561
02:41:42,840 --> 02:41:44,550
maybe i'm quoting him out of context yes
okay uh

9562
02:41:44,550 --> 02:41:44,560
okay uh
 

9563
02:41:44,560 --> 02:41:46,630
okay uh
let me just ask you about some possible

9564
02:41:46,630 --> 02:41:46,640
let me just ask you about some possible
 

9565
02:41:46,640 --> 02:41:49,030
let me just ask you about some possible
criticisms of bitcoin

9566
02:41:49,030 --> 02:41:49,040
criticisms of bitcoin
 

9567
02:41:49,040 --> 02:41:51,269
criticisms of bitcoin
so on centralization so

9568
02:41:51,269 --> 02:41:51,279
so on centralization so
 

9569
02:41:51,279 --> 02:41:53,269
so on centralization so
there's a criticism on the so on the

9570
02:41:53,269 --> 02:41:53,279
there's a criticism on the so on the
 

9571
02:41:53,279 --> 02:41:56,469
there's a criticism on the so on the
mining and on the node side uh or the

9572
02:41:56,469 --> 02:41:56,479
mining and on the node side uh or the
 

9573
02:41:56,479 --> 02:41:58,630
mining and on the node side uh or the
node is not really the criticism but

9574
02:41:58,630 --> 02:41:58,640
node is not really the criticism but
 

9575
02:41:58,640 --> 02:42:00,070
node is not really the criticism but
bitcoin mining is not fully

9576
02:42:00,070 --> 02:42:00,080
bitcoin mining is not fully
 

9577
02:42:00,080 --> 02:42:01,990
bitcoin mining is not fully
decentralized because a small number of

9578
02:42:01,990 --> 02:42:02,000
decentralized because a small number of
 

9579
02:42:02,000 --> 02:42:04,790
decentralized because a small number of
miners uh control a majority of the

9580
02:42:04,790 --> 02:42:04,800
miners uh control a majority of the
 

9581
02:42:04,800 --> 02:42:06,070
miners uh control a majority of the
hashing power

9582
02:42:06,070 --> 02:42:06,080
hashing power
 

9583
02:42:06,080 --> 02:42:07,910
hashing power
i looked it up as ten thousand fifteen

9584
02:42:07,910 --> 02:42:07,920
i looked it up as ten thousand fifteen
 

9585
02:42:07,920 --> 02:42:09,750
i looked it up as ten thousand fifteen
thousand whatever the number is of of

9586
02:42:09,750 --> 02:42:09,760
thousand whatever the number is of of
 

9587
02:42:09,760 --> 02:42:11,190
thousand whatever the number is of of
computers they have the full that are

9588
02:42:11,190 --> 02:42:11,200
computers they have the full that are
 

9589
02:42:11,200 --> 02:42:13,269
computers they have the full that are
full nodes that have the full

9590
02:42:13,269 --> 02:42:13,279
full nodes that have the full
 

9591
02:42:13,279 --> 02:42:15,830
full nodes that have the full
uh that are actively connected to the

9592
02:42:15,830 --> 02:42:15,840
uh that are actively connected to the
 

9593
02:42:15,840 --> 02:42:17,429
uh that are actively connected to the
network so you could argue that's

9594
02:42:17,429 --> 02:42:17,439
network so you could argue that's
 

9595
02:42:17,439 --> 02:42:19,110
network so you could argue that's
decentralized because it's global it's

9596
02:42:19,110 --> 02:42:19,120
decentralized because it's global it's
 

9597
02:42:19,120 --> 02:42:21,830
decentralized because it's global it's
all across the world but the miners

9598
02:42:21,830 --> 02:42:21,840
all across the world but the miners
 

9599
02:42:21,840 --> 02:42:23,030
all across the world but the miners
they're still

9600
02:42:23,030 --> 02:42:23,040
they're still
 

9601
02:42:23,040 --> 02:42:23,990
they're still
um

9602
02:42:23,990 --> 02:42:24,000
um
 

9603
02:42:24,000 --> 02:42:26,070
um
it's more centralized so if you're

9604
02:42:26,070 --> 02:42:26,080
it's more centralized so if you're
 

9605
02:42:26,080 --> 02:42:27,830
it's more centralized so if you're
thinking of making a case for bitcoin

9606
02:42:27,830 --> 02:42:27,840
thinking of making a case for bitcoin
 

9607
02:42:27,840 --> 02:42:30,070
thinking of making a case for bitcoin
being decentralized

9608
02:42:30,070 --> 02:42:30,080
being decentralized
 

9609
02:42:30,080 --> 02:42:32,469
being decentralized
do you worry about the miners

9610
02:42:32,469 --> 02:42:32,479
do you worry about the miners
 

9611
02:42:32,479 --> 02:42:34,950
do you worry about the miners
being somewhat centralized is is the

9612
02:42:34,950 --> 02:42:34,960
being somewhat centralized is is the
 

9613
02:42:34,960 --> 02:42:37,349
being somewhat centralized is is the
nodes the important thing to think about

9614
02:42:37,349 --> 02:42:37,359
nodes the important thing to think about
 

9615
02:42:37,359 --> 02:42:39,990
nodes the important thing to think about
yeah and what number of nodes counts are

9616
02:42:39,990 --> 02:42:40,000
yeah and what number of nodes counts are
 

9617
02:42:40,000 --> 02:42:42,150
yeah and what number of nodes counts are
centralized and not

9618
02:42:42,150 --> 02:42:42,160
centralized and not
 

9619
02:42:42,160 --> 02:42:43,590
centralized and not
the nodes are what matters because the

9620
02:42:43,590 --> 02:42:43,600
the nodes are what matters because the
 

9621
02:42:43,600 --> 02:42:45,590
the nodes are what matters because the
nodes are what uh determines bitcoin's

9622
02:42:45,590 --> 02:42:45,600
nodes are what uh determines bitcoin's
 

9623
02:42:45,600 --> 02:42:49,030
nodes are what uh determines bitcoin's
consensus parameters i think the the um

9624
02:42:49,030 --> 02:42:49,040
consensus parameters i think the the um
 

9625
02:42:49,040 --> 02:42:50,790
consensus parameters i think the the um
the the best way to think about it is

9626
02:42:50,790 --> 02:42:50,800
the the best way to think about it is
 

9627
02:42:50,800 --> 02:42:54,070
the the best way to think about it is
that miners simply sell a commodity to

9628
02:42:54,070 --> 02:42:54,080
that miners simply sell a commodity to
 

9629
02:42:54,080 --> 02:42:56,309
that miners simply sell a commodity to
the nodes and that commodity is bitcoin

9630
02:42:56,309 --> 02:42:56,319
the nodes and that commodity is bitcoin
 

9631
02:42:56,319 --> 02:42:58,550
the nodes and that commodity is bitcoin
blocks so what a miner does is they

9632
02:42:58,550 --> 02:42:58,560
blocks so what a miner does is they
 

9633
02:42:58,560 --> 02:43:00,710
blocks so what a miner does is they
solve the proof-of-work problem so they

9634
02:43:00,710 --> 02:43:00,720
solve the proof-of-work problem so they
 

9635
02:43:00,720 --> 02:43:02,389
solve the proof-of-work problem so they
keep operating their computers until

9636
02:43:02,389 --> 02:43:02,399
keep operating their computers until
 

9637
02:43:02,399 --> 02:43:04,790
keep operating their computers until
they can get a solution to the problem

9638
02:43:04,790 --> 02:43:04,800
they can get a solution to the problem
 

9639
02:43:04,800 --> 02:43:06,389
they can get a solution to the problem
and then they attach that to a bunch of

9640
02:43:06,389 --> 02:43:06,399
and then they attach that to a bunch of
 

9641
02:43:06,399 --> 02:43:08,630
and then they attach that to a bunch of
transactions and present it to the nodes

9642
02:43:08,630 --> 02:43:08,640
transactions and present it to the nodes
 

9643
02:43:08,640 --> 02:43:11,429
transactions and present it to the nodes
for the nodes to ratify and approve it

9644
02:43:11,429 --> 02:43:11,439
for the nodes to ratify and approve it
 

9645
02:43:11,439 --> 02:43:13,510
for the nodes to ratify and approve it
so therefore uh this is

9646
02:43:13,510 --> 02:43:13,520
so therefore uh this is
 

9647
02:43:13,520 --> 02:43:15,510
so therefore uh this is
and this is i i strongly recommend

9648
02:43:15,510 --> 02:43:15,520
and this is i i strongly recommend
 

9649
02:43:15,520 --> 02:43:18,389
and this is i i strongly recommend
people learn about the 2017 block size

of the game
 

9717
02:44:20,399 --> 02:44:22,150
of the game
the miners

9718
02:44:22,150 --> 02:44:22,160
the miners
 

9719
02:44:22,160 --> 02:44:24,710
the miners
are a service provider the miners invest

9720
02:44:24,710 --> 02:44:24,720
are a service provider the miners invest
 

9721
02:44:24,720 --> 02:44:27,030
are a service provider the miners invest
capital up front you know they buy the

9722
02:44:27,030 --> 02:44:27,040
capital up front you know they buy the
 

9723
02:44:27,040 --> 02:44:29,110
capital up front you know they buy the
machines they buy the electricity they

9724
02:44:29,110 --> 02:44:29,120
machines they buy the electricity they
 

9725
02:44:29,120 --> 02:44:31,429
machines they buy the electricity they
buy the storage they buy the locations

9726
02:44:31,429 --> 02:44:31,439
buy the storage they buy the locations
 

9727
02:44:31,439 --> 02:44:33,030
buy the storage they buy the locations
they pay the rent

9728
02:44:33,030 --> 02:44:33,040
they pay the rent
 

9729
02:44:33,040 --> 02:44:35,670
they pay the rent
and they invest all that money

9730
02:44:35,670 --> 02:44:35,680
and they invest all that money
 

9731
02:44:35,680 --> 02:44:37,830
and they invest all that money
based on the idea that if they behave

9732
02:44:37,830 --> 02:44:37,840
based on the idea that if they behave
 

9733
02:44:37,840 --> 02:44:39,830
based on the idea that if they behave
according to what the nodes want the

9734
02:44:39,830 --> 02:44:39,840
according to what the nodes want the
 

9735
02:44:39,840 --> 02:44:42,150
according to what the nodes want the
nodes will reward them with bitcoin so

9736
02:44:42,150 --> 02:44:42,160
nodes will reward them with bitcoin so
 

9737
02:44:42,160 --> 02:44:43,990
nodes will reward them with bitcoin so
the miners are in no position to dictate

9738
02:44:43,990 --> 02:44:44,000
the miners are in no position to dictate
 

9739
02:44:44,000 --> 02:44:45,750
the miners are in no position to dictate
terms for anyone you know they've

9740
02:44:45,750 --> 02:44:45,760
terms for anyone you know they've
 

9741
02:44:45,760 --> 02:44:47,670
terms for anyone you know they've
they've put up their capital up front

9742
02:44:47,670 --> 02:44:47,680
they've put up their capital up front
 

9743
02:44:47,680 --> 02:44:50,070
they've put up their capital up front
and they will only recoup it if they do

9744
02:44:50,070 --> 02:44:50,080
and they will only recoup it if they do
 

9745
02:44:50,080 --> 02:44:51,510
and they will only recoup it if they do
what the nodes want

9746
02:44:51,510 --> 02:44:51,520
what the nodes want
 

9747
02:44:51,520 --> 02:44:53,429
what the nodes want
so therefore what really matters is the

9748
02:44:53,429 --> 02:44:53,439
so therefore what really matters is the
 

9749
02:44:53,439 --> 02:44:55,110
so therefore what really matters is the
decentralization of the nodes so we want

9750
02:44:55,110 --> 02:44:55,120
decentralization of the nodes so we want
 

9751
02:44:55,120 --> 02:44:57,429
decentralization of the nodes so we want
to we you want to have as many nodes as

9752
02:44:57,429 --> 02:44:57,439
to we you want to have as many nodes as
 

9753
02:44:57,439 --> 02:44:59,269
to we you want to have as many nodes as
possible you should um you want to have

9754
02:44:59,269 --> 02:44:59,279
possible you should um you want to have
 

9755
02:44:59,279 --> 02:45:01,349
possible you should um you want to have
a system where there's a large number of

9756
02:45:01,349 --> 02:45:01,359
a system where there's a large number of
 

9757
02:45:01,359 --> 02:45:03,910
a system where there's a large number of
nodes and this is of course the biggest

9758
02:45:03,910 --> 02:45:03,920
nodes and this is of course the biggest
 

9759
02:45:03,920 --> 02:45:06,389
nodes and this is of course the biggest
problem with um

9760
02:45:06,389 --> 02:45:06,399
problem with um
 

9761
02:45:06,399 --> 02:45:08,150
problem with um
with other digital currencies is that

9762
02:45:08,150 --> 02:45:08,160
with other digital currencies is that
 

9763
02:45:08,160 --> 02:45:10,230
with other digital currencies is that
you know because basically bitcoin has

9764
02:45:10,230 --> 02:45:10,240
you know because basically bitcoin has
 

9765
02:45:10,240 --> 02:45:12,389
you know because basically bitcoin has
cornered the market on a digital

9766
02:45:12,389 --> 02:45:12,399
cornered the market on a digital
 

9767
02:45:12,399 --> 02:45:13,910
cornered the market on a digital
currency the only way that you can

9768
02:45:13,910 --> 02:45:13,920
currency the only way that you can
 

9769
02:45:13,920 --> 02:45:17,030
currency the only way that you can
really get traction um is to generate a

9770
02:45:17,030 --> 02:45:17,040
really get traction um is to generate a
 

9771
02:45:17,040 --> 02:45:18,389
really get traction um is to generate a
whole bunch of buzzwords but you know

9772
02:45:18,389 --> 02:45:18,399
whole bunch of buzzwords but you know
 

9773
02:45:18,399 --> 02:45:20,389
whole bunch of buzzwords but you know
we're doing this and we're doing that

9774
02:45:20,389 --> 02:45:20,399
we're doing this and we're doing that
 

9775
02:45:20,399 --> 02:45:21,830
we're doing this and we're doing that
and so

9776
02:45:21,830 --> 02:45:21,840
and so
 

9777
02:45:21,840 --> 02:45:23,670
and so
other digital currencies are optimized

9778
02:45:23,670 --> 02:45:23,680
other digital currencies are optimized
 

9779
02:45:23,680 --> 02:45:25,190
other digital currencies are optimized
for um

9780
02:45:25,190 --> 02:45:25,200
for um
 

9781
02:45:25,200 --> 02:45:27,990
for um
bells and whistles and buzzwords and

9782
02:45:27,990 --> 02:45:28,000
bells and whistles and buzzwords and
 

9783
02:45:28,000 --> 02:45:30,630
bells and whistles and buzzwords and
that means adding a computational load

9784
02:45:30,630 --> 02:45:30,640
that means adding a computational load
 

9785
02:45:30,640 --> 02:45:32,710
that means adding a computational load
which makes the nodes bigger harder to

9786
02:45:32,710 --> 02:45:32,720
which makes the nodes bigger harder to
 

9787
02:45:32,720 --> 02:45:34,389
which makes the nodes bigger harder to
operate and therefore you have a very

9788
02:45:34,389 --> 02:45:34,399
operate and therefore you have a very
 

9789
02:45:34,399 --> 02:45:36,710
operate and therefore you have a very
small number of nodes in fact

9790
02:45:36,710 --> 02:45:36,720
small number of nodes in fact
 

9791
02:45:36,720 --> 02:45:39,429
small number of nodes in fact
very few digital currencies are

9792
02:45:39,429 --> 02:45:39,439
very few digital currencies are
 

9793
02:45:39,439 --> 02:45:41,269
very few digital currencies are
keen to publicize how many nodes there

9794
02:45:41,269 --> 02:45:41,279
keen to publicize how many nodes there
 

9795
02:45:41,279 --> 02:45:43,349
keen to publicize how many nodes there
are and they don't have full nodes in

9796
02:45:43,349 --> 02:45:43,359
are and they don't have full nodes in
 

9797
02:45:43,359 --> 02:45:45,110
are and they don't have full nodes in
the true sense and it doesn't even

9798
02:45:45,110 --> 02:45:45,120
the true sense and it doesn't even
 

9799
02:45:45,120 --> 02:45:47,349
the true sense and it doesn't even
matter how many nodes they have because

9800
02:45:47,349 --> 02:45:47,359
matter how many nodes they have because
 

9801
02:45:47,359 --> 02:45:48,790
matter how many nodes they have because
um

9802
02:45:48,790 --> 02:45:48,800
um
 

9803
02:45:48,800 --> 02:45:51,670
um
de facto you know you can you can spin

9804
02:45:51,670 --> 02:45:51,680
de facto you know you can you can spin
 

9805
02:45:51,680 --> 02:45:55,670
de facto you know you can you can spin
up a million nodes tomorrow on aws

9806
02:45:55,670 --> 02:45:55,680
up a million nodes tomorrow on aws
 

9807
02:45:55,680 --> 02:45:57,030
up a million nodes tomorrow on aws
doesn't really matter

9808
02:45:57,030 --> 02:45:57,040
doesn't really matter
 

9809
02:45:57,040 --> 02:45:59,590
doesn't really matter
what matters is de facto do the nodes

9810
02:45:59,590 --> 02:45:59,600
what matters is de facto do the nodes
 

9811
02:45:59,600 --> 02:46:02,309
what matters is de facto do the nodes
dictate the rules of consensus and the

9812
02:46:02,309 --> 02:46:02,319
dictate the rules of consensus and the
 

9813
02:46:02,319 --> 02:46:03,830
dictate the rules of consensus and the
fact that with most digital currencies

9814
02:46:03,830 --> 02:46:03,840
fact that with most digital currencies
 

9815
02:46:03,840 --> 02:46:05,990
fact that with most digital currencies
you can have hard forks very frequently

9816
02:46:05,990 --> 02:46:06,000
you can have hard forks very frequently
 

9817
02:46:06,000 --> 02:46:07,190
you can have hard forks very frequently
and they can change the supply all the

9818
02:46:07,190 --> 02:46:07,200
and they can change the supply all the
 

9819
02:46:07,200 --> 02:46:08,070
and they can change the supply all the
time

9820
02:46:08,070 --> 02:46:08,080
time
 

9821
02:46:08,080 --> 02:46:09,190
time
means that there's a small group of

9822
02:46:09,190 --> 02:46:09,200
means that there's a small group of
 

9823
02:46:09,200 --> 02:46:10,710
means that there's a small group of
people who agree amongst themselves how

9824
02:46:10,710 --> 02:46:10,720
people who agree amongst themselves how
 

9825
02:46:10,720 --> 02:46:13,190
people who agree amongst themselves how
to move forward yeah so you you threw in

9826
02:46:13,190 --> 02:46:13,200
to move forward yeah so you you threw in
 

9827
02:46:13,200 --> 02:46:15,190
to move forward yeah so you you threw in
a few criticisms of all coins there but

9828
02:46:15,190 --> 02:46:15,200
a few criticisms of all coins there but
 

9829
02:46:15,200 --> 02:46:17,030
a few criticisms of all coins there but
so one is the small group

9830
02:46:17,030 --> 02:46:17,040
so one is the small group
 

9831
02:46:17,040 --> 02:46:18,630
so one is the small group
that one we could we could talk about

9832
02:46:18,630 --> 02:46:18,640
that one we could we could talk about
 

9833
02:46:18,640 --> 02:46:20,950
that one we could we could talk about
it's a tricky one and we we talked about

9834
02:46:20,950 --> 02:46:20,960
it's a tricky one and we we talked about
 

9835
02:46:20,960 --> 02:46:23,269
it's a tricky one and we we talked about
that with satoshi nakamoto but the other

9836
02:46:23,269 --> 02:46:23,279
that with satoshi nakamoto but the other
 

9837
02:46:23,279 --> 02:46:24,630
that with satoshi nakamoto but the other
one is a

9838
02:46:24,630 --> 02:46:24,640
one is a
 

9839
02:46:24,640 --> 02:46:26,630
one is a
small number of nodes so to push back on

9840
02:46:26,630 --> 02:46:26,640
small number of nodes so to push back on
 

9841
02:46:26,640 --> 02:46:28,870
small number of nodes so to push back on
that as computational power increases

9842
02:46:28,870 --> 02:46:28,880
that as computational power increases
 

9843
02:46:28,880 --> 02:46:30,469
that as computational power increases
you can argue that

9844
02:46:30,469 --> 02:46:30,479
you can argue that
 

9845
02:46:30,479 --> 02:46:32,950
you can argue that
that enables more and more uh cheap

9846
02:46:32,950 --> 02:46:32,960
that enables more and more uh cheap
 

9847
02:46:32,960 --> 02:46:35,830
that enables more and more uh cheap
computers to serve as uh nodes so at

9848
02:46:35,830 --> 02:46:35,840
computers to serve as uh nodes so at
 

9849
02:46:35,840 --> 02:46:37,429
computers to serve as uh nodes so at
least it paints the

9850
02:46:37,429 --> 02:46:37,439
least it paints the
 

9851
02:46:37,439 --> 02:46:39,990
least it paints the
future where nodes are always increasing

9852
02:46:39,990 --> 02:46:40,000
future where nodes are always increasing
 

9853
02:46:40,000 --> 02:46:41,510
future where nodes are always increasing
because computational power is always

9854
02:46:41,510 --> 02:46:41,520
because computational power is always
 

9855
02:46:41,520 --> 02:46:43,190
because computational power is always
increasing and getting cheaper and

9856
02:46:43,190 --> 02:46:43,200
increasing and getting cheaper and
 

9857
02:46:43,200 --> 02:46:45,030
increasing and getting cheaper and
cheaper and cheaper so at least there's

9858
02:46:45,030 --> 02:46:45,040
cheaper and cheaper so at least there's
 

9859
02:46:45,040 --> 02:46:46,710
cheaper and cheaper so at least there's
a hope for the future for greater and

9860
02:46:46,710 --> 02:46:46,720
a hope for the future for greater and
 

9861
02:46:46,720 --> 02:46:47,990
a hope for the future for greater and
greater decentralization

9862
02:46:47,990 --> 02:46:48,000
greater decentralization
 

9863
02:46:48,000 --> 02:46:50,389
greater decentralization
decentralization on the node front

9864
02:46:50,389 --> 02:46:50,399
decentralization on the node front
 

9865
02:46:50,399 --> 02:46:51,750
decentralization on the node front
yeah but i mean

9866
02:46:51,750 --> 02:46:51,760
yeah but i mean
 

9867
02:46:51,760 --> 02:46:53,269
yeah but i mean
ultimately again it doesn't really

9868
02:46:53,269 --> 02:46:53,279
ultimately again it doesn't really
 

9869
02:46:53,279 --> 02:46:56,469
ultimately again it doesn't really
matter how many nodes uh you have if you

9870
02:46:56,469 --> 02:46:56,479
matter how many nodes uh you have if you
 

9871
02:46:56,479 --> 02:46:58,070
matter how many nodes uh you have if you
have a you know

9872
02:46:58,070 --> 02:46:58,080
have a you know
 

9873
02:46:58,080 --> 02:46:59,510
have a you know
if the way that the currency is run is

9874
02:46:59,510 --> 02:46:59,520
if the way that the currency is run is
 

9875
02:46:59,520 --> 02:47:00,950
if the way that the currency is run is
that you're going to have a hard fork

9876
02:47:00,950 --> 02:47:00,960
that you're going to have a hard fork
 

9877
02:47:00,960 --> 02:47:02,469
that you're going to have a hard fork
every few months which is the case with

9878
02:47:02,469 --> 02:47:02,479
every few months which is the case with
 

9879
02:47:02,479 --> 02:47:03,830
every few months which is the case with
most other currencies bitcoin is the

9880
02:47:03,830 --> 02:47:03,840
most other currencies bitcoin is the
 

9881
02:47:03,840 --> 02:47:06,630
most other currencies bitcoin is the
only one that's not have a hard fork

9882
02:47:06,630 --> 02:47:06,640
only one that's not have a hard fork
 

9883
02:47:06,640 --> 02:47:09,110
only one that's not have a hard fork
um basically the the unique thing about

9884
02:47:09,110 --> 02:47:09,120
um basically the the unique thing about
 

9885
02:47:09,120 --> 02:47:11,349
um basically the the unique thing about
bitcoin uh in a tactical sense is that

9886
02:47:11,349 --> 02:47:11,359
bitcoin uh in a tactical sense is that
 

9887
02:47:11,359 --> 02:47:13,269
bitcoin uh in a tactical sense is that
you could get the original software that

9888
02:47:13,269 --> 02:47:13,279
you could get the original software that
 

9889
02:47:13,279 --> 02:47:15,269
you could get the original software that
satoshi himself ran

9890
02:47:15,269 --> 02:47:15,279
satoshi himself ran
 

9891
02:47:15,279 --> 02:47:18,469
satoshi himself ran
in 2009 to start the network

9892
02:47:18,469 --> 02:47:18,479
in 2009 to start the network
 

9893
02:47:18,479 --> 02:47:21,590
in 2009 to start the network
and you could run it today

9894
02:47:21,590 --> 02:47:21,600
and you could run it today
 

9895
02:47:21,600 --> 02:47:23,030
and you could run it today
and it would sync with the blockchain

9896
02:47:23,030 --> 02:47:23,040
and it would sync with the blockchain
 

9897
02:47:23,040 --> 02:47:25,349
and it would sync with the blockchain
there's one bug you need to fix

9898
02:47:25,349 --> 02:47:25,359
there's one bug you need to fix
 

9899
02:47:25,359 --> 02:47:27,670
there's one bug you need to fix
uh one mistake that was owned that would

9900
02:47:27,670 --> 02:47:27,680
uh one mistake that was owned that would
 

9901
02:47:27,680 --> 02:47:28,950
uh one mistake that was owned that would
have only appeared i think in around

9902
02:47:28,950 --> 02:47:28,960
have only appeared i think in around
 

9903
02:47:28,960 --> 02:47:31,590
have only appeared i think in around
2013 or 14 or something like that

9904
02:47:31,590 --> 02:47:31,600
2013 or 14 or something like that
 

9905
02:47:31,600 --> 02:47:33,110
2013 or 14 or something like that
that he wasn't aware of back then so you

9906
02:47:33,110 --> 02:47:33,120
that he wasn't aware of back then so you
 

9907
02:47:33,120 --> 02:47:34,630
that he wasn't aware of back then so you
just need to fix this one tiny little

9908
02:47:34,630 --> 02:47:34,640
just need to fix this one tiny little
 

9909
02:47:34,640 --> 02:47:35,429
just need to fix this one tiny little
bug

9910
02:47:35,429 --> 02:47:35,439
bug
 

9911
02:47:35,439 --> 02:47:37,030
bug
and then the consensus parameters are

9912
02:47:37,030 --> 02:47:37,040
and then the consensus parameters are
 

9913
02:47:37,040 --> 02:47:38,630
and then the consensus parameters are
still the same so you're able to sync to

9914
02:47:38,630 --> 02:47:38,640
still the same so you're able to sync to
 

9915
02:47:38,640 --> 02:47:40,710
still the same so you're able to sync to
it this is not true for most other

9916
02:47:40,710 --> 02:47:40,720
it this is not true for most other
 

9917
02:47:40,720 --> 02:47:42,469
it this is not true for most other
digital currencies i'd say probably all

9918
02:47:42,469 --> 02:47:42,479
digital currencies i'd say probably all
 

9919
02:47:42,479 --> 02:47:44,230
digital currencies i'd say probably all
of them because they've all had many

9920
02:47:44,230 --> 02:47:44,240
of them because they've all had many
 

9921
02:47:44,240 --> 02:47:45,750
of them because they've all had many
hard forks which they think of as

9922
02:47:45,750 --> 02:47:45,760
hard forks which they think of as
 

9923
02:47:45,760 --> 02:47:48,070
hard forks which they think of as
upgrades and you know they they market

9924
02:47:48,070 --> 02:47:48,080
upgrades and you know they they market
 

9925
02:47:48,080 --> 02:47:49,990
upgrades and you know they they market
this thing as you know well bitcoin

9926
02:47:49,990 --> 02:47:50,000
this thing as you know well bitcoin
 

9927
02:47:50,000 --> 02:47:51,670
this thing as you know well bitcoin
can't upgrade but we upgrade all the

upgrades all the time um facebook apple
amazon anything that centralizes very

9934

amazon anything that centralizes very
 

9935
02:47:58,319 --> 02:48:00,309
amazon anything that centralizes very
easy to upgrade and that's precisely why

9936
02:48:00,309 --> 02:48:00,319
easy to upgrade and that's precisely why
 

9937
02:48:00,319 --> 02:48:02,309
easy to upgrade and that's precisely why

of course there is hard forks of

9968
02:48:37,510 --> 02:48:37,520
of course there is hard forks of
 

9969
02:48:37,520 --> 02:48:39,990
of course there is hard forks of
uh bitcoin as well

9970
02:48:39,990 --> 02:48:40,000
uh bitcoin as well
 

9971
02:48:40,000 --> 02:48:42,389
uh bitcoin as well
i'm sure all of which you love

9972
02:48:42,389 --> 02:48:42,399
i'm sure all of which you love
 

9973
02:48:42,399 --> 02:48:44,230
i'm sure all of which you love
dearly anyway but that doesn't that

9974
02:48:44,230 --> 02:48:44,240
dearly anyway but that doesn't that
 

9975
02:48:44,240 --> 02:48:46,230
dearly anyway but that doesn't that
doesn't matter the original bitcoin uh

9976
02:48:46,230 --> 02:48:46,240
doesn't matter the original bitcoin uh
 

9977
02:48:46,240 --> 02:48:48,309
doesn't matter the original bitcoin uh
for the most part has has not undergone

9978
02:48:48,309 --> 02:48:48,319
for the most part has has not undergone
 

9979
02:48:48,319 --> 02:48:49,830
for the most part has has not undergone
any changes

9980
02:48:49,830 --> 02:48:49,840
any changes
 

9981
02:48:49,840 --> 02:48:51,030
any changes
and that's one of the i mean it has

9982
02:48:51,030 --> 02:48:51,040
and that's one of the i mean it has
 

9983
02:48:51,040 --> 02:48:53,590
and that's one of the i mean it has
undergone changes but none on none in

9984
02:48:53,590 --> 02:48:53,600
undergone changes but none on none in
 

9985
02:48:53,600 --> 02:48:55,990
undergone changes but none on none in
the uh important parameters of the

9986
02:48:55,990 --> 02:48:56,000
the uh important parameters of the
 

9987
02:48:56,000 --> 02:48:57,030
the uh important parameters of the
network

9988
02:48:57,030 --> 02:48:57,040
network
 

9989
02:48:57,040 --> 02:48:58,630
network
so another criticism

9990
02:48:58,630 --> 02:48:58,640
so another criticism
 

9991
02:48:58,640 --> 02:49:00,790
so another criticism
is about energy

9992
02:49:00,790 --> 02:49:00,800
is about energy
 

9993
02:49:00,800 --> 02:49:03,030
is about energy
so the proof of work contestants

9994
02:49:03,030 --> 02:49:03,040
so the proof of work contestants
 

9995
02:49:03,040 --> 02:49:05,990
so the proof of work contestants
mechanism uses a lot of energy

9996
02:49:05,990 --> 02:49:06,000
mechanism uses a lot of energy
 

9997
02:49:06,000 --> 02:49:07,910
mechanism uses a lot of energy
what's the response to that criticism of

9998
02:49:07,910 --> 02:49:07,920
what's the response to that criticism of
 

9999
02:49:07,920 --> 02:49:10,830
what's the response to that criticism of
bitcoin yes because it's worth

10000
02:49:10,830 --> 02:49:10,840
bitcoin yes because it's worth
 

10001
02:49:10,840 --> 02:49:13,670
bitcoin yes because it's worth
it okay the airplane uses a lot more

10002
02:49:13,670 --> 02:49:13,680
it okay the airplane uses a lot more
 

10003
02:49:13,680 --> 02:49:15,190
it okay the airplane uses a lot more
energy than a kayak you know when you're

10004
02:49:15,190 --> 02:49:15,200
energy than a kayak you know when you're
 

10005
02:49:15,200 --> 02:49:16,790
energy than a kayak you know when you're
gonna cross the atlantic next time what

10006
02:49:16,790 --> 02:49:16,800
gonna cross the atlantic next time what
 

10007
02:49:16,800 --> 02:49:18,309
gonna cross the atlantic next time what
are you gonna take a kayak that is

10008
02:49:18,309 --> 02:49:18,319
are you gonna take a kayak that is
 

10009
02:49:18,319 --> 02:49:19,990
are you gonna take a kayak that is
environmentally friendly according to

10010
02:49:19,990 --> 02:49:20,000
environmentally friendly according to
 

10011
02:49:20,000 --> 02:49:21,910
environmentally friendly according to
this insane definition or are you gonna

10012
02:49:21,910 --> 02:49:21,920
this insane definition or are you gonna
 

10013
02:49:21,920 --> 02:49:23,510
this insane definition or are you gonna
take an airplane that consumes a lot of

10014
02:49:23,510 --> 02:49:23,520
take an airplane that consumes a lot of
 

10015
02:49:23,520 --> 02:49:27,910
take an airplane that consumes a lot of
energy so the cost benefit analysis here

10016
02:49:27,910 --> 02:49:27,920
energy so the cost benefit analysis here
 

10017
02:49:27,920 --> 02:49:29,670
energy so the cost benefit analysis here
is such where you have to consider both

10018
02:49:29,670 --> 02:49:29,680
is such where you have to consider both
 

10019
02:49:29,680 --> 02:49:31,269
is such where you have to consider both
the cost and the benefit

10020
02:49:31,269 --> 02:49:31,279
the cost and the benefit
 

10021
02:49:31,279 --> 02:49:34,230
the cost and the benefit
exactly and i think it's an astonishing

10022
02:49:34,230 --> 02:49:34,240
exactly and i think it's an astonishing
 

10023
02:49:34,240 --> 02:49:36,870
exactly and i think it's an astonishing
testament to just how far backward

10024
02:49:36,870 --> 02:49:36,880
testament to just how far backward
 

10025
02:49:36,880 --> 02:49:39,990
testament to just how far backward
people's scientific and technological

10026
02:49:39,990 --> 02:49:40,000
people's scientific and technological
 

10027
02:49:40,000 --> 02:49:41,910
people's scientific and technological
thinking has devolved to the point where

10028
02:49:41,910 --> 02:49:41,920
thinking has devolved to the point where
 

10029
02:49:41,920 --> 02:49:43,750
thinking has devolved to the point where
we think of energy consumption as a bad

10030
02:49:43,750 --> 02:49:43,760
we think of energy consumption as a bad
 

10031
02:49:43,760 --> 02:49:45,830
we think of energy consumption as a bad
thing i think it's just and in the fiat

10032
02:49:45,830 --> 02:49:45,840
thing i think it's just and in the fiat
 

10033
02:49:45,840 --> 02:49:47,349

02:52:30,800 --> 02:52:33,190
and um bitcoin is just
another technology it does consume a lot

10192
02:52:33,190 --> 02:52:33,200
another technology it does consume a lot
 

10193
02:52:33,200 --> 02:52:34,710
another technology it does consume a lot
more energy than central banks a lot of

10194
02:52:34,710 --> 02:52:34,720
more energy than central banks a lot of
 

10195
02:52:34,720 --> 02:52:36,309
more energy than central banks a lot of
bitcoiners like to

10196
02:52:36,309 --> 02:52:36,319
bitcoiners like to
 

10197
02:52:36,319 --> 02:52:37,990
bitcoiners like to
take and a cop out of this by saying

10198
02:52:37,990 --> 02:52:38,000
take and a cop out of this by saying
 

10199
02:52:38,000 --> 02:52:39,670
take and a cop out of this by saying
well you know central banks consume

10200
02:52:39,670 --> 02:52:39,680
well you know central banks consume
 

10201
02:52:39,680 --> 02:52:42,870
well you know central banks consume
money and atms consume energy and i

10202
02:52:42,870 --> 02:52:42,880
money and atms consume energy and i
 

10203
02:52:42,880 --> 02:52:44,550
money and atms consume energy and i
think if you calculate how much central

10204
02:52:44,550 --> 02:52:44,560
think if you calculate how much central
 

10205
02:52:44,560 --> 02:52:46,230
think if you calculate how much central
banks and banks consume i think it's a

10206
02:52:46,230 --> 02:52:46,240
banks and banks consume i think it's a
 

10207
02:52:46,240 --> 02:52:48,230
banks and banks consume i think it's a
rounding error next to

10208
02:52:48,230 --> 02:52:48,240
rounding error next to
 

10209
02:52:48,240 --> 02:52:50,230
rounding error next to
what bitcoin consumes i think bitcoin is

10210
02:52:50,230 --> 02:52:50,240
what bitcoin consumes i think bitcoin is
 

10211
02:52:50,240 --> 02:52:52,309
what bitcoin consumes i think bitcoin is
just maybe not a rounding error but it's

10212
02:52:52,309 --> 02:52:52,319
just maybe not a rounding error but it's
 

10213
02:52:52,319 --> 02:52:54,070
just maybe not a rounding error but it's
still bitcoin i think is going to

10214
02:52:54,070 --> 02:52:54,080
still bitcoin i think is going to
 

10215
02:52:54,080 --> 02:52:55,670
still bitcoin i think is going to
consume a lot more and that's a good

10216
02:52:55,670 --> 02:52:55,680
consume a lot more and that's a good
 

10217
02:52:55,680 --> 02:52:57,269
consume a lot more and that's a good
thing you know what's humbling is to

10218
02:52:57,269 --> 02:52:57,279
thing you know what's humbling is to
 

10219
02:52:57,279 --> 02:52:59,990
thing you know what's humbling is to
look because even just looking into this

10220
02:52:59,990 --> 02:53:00,000
look because even just looking into this
 

10221
02:53:00,000 --> 02:53:01,590
look because even just looking into this
forces me to look at the energy

10222
02:53:01,590 --> 02:53:01,600
forces me to look at the energy
 

10223
02:53:01,600 --> 02:53:03,349
forces me to look at the energy
expenditures for many of the things we

10224
02:53:03,349 --> 02:53:03,359
expenditures for many of the things we
 

10225
02:53:03,359 --> 02:53:05,670
expenditures for many of the things we
take for granted obviously computers and

10226
02:53:05,670 --> 02:53:05,680
take for granted obviously computers and
 

10227
02:53:05,680 --> 02:53:07,190
take for granted obviously computers and
other digital

10228
02:53:07,190 --> 02:53:07,200
other digital
 

10229
02:53:07,200 --> 02:53:08,710

our digital lives
 

10231
02:53:08,720 --> 02:53:11,429
our digital lives
i just uh bitcoin becomes a rounding

10232
02:53:11,429 --> 02:53:11,439
i just uh bitcoin becomes a rounding
 

10233
02:53:11,439 --> 02:53:12,790
i just uh bitcoin becomes a rounding
error

10234
02:53:12,790 --> 02:53:12,800
error
 

10235
02:53:12,800 --> 02:53:15,190
error
relative to how much energy spent on all

10236
02:53:15,190 --> 02:53:15,200
relative to how much energy spent on all
 

10237
02:53:15,200 --> 02:53:18,150
relative to how much energy spent on all
the computers in our world but also like

10238
02:53:18,150 --> 02:53:18,160
the computers in our world but also like
 

10239
02:53:18,160 --> 02:53:20,309
the computers in our world but also like
things like home appliances microwaves

10240
02:53:20,309 --> 02:53:20,319
things like home appliances microwaves
 

10241
02:53:20,319 --> 02:53:22,830
things like home appliances microwaves
and yeah hair dryers and stuff

10242

yeah i mean this is
 

10247
02:53:25,760 --> 02:53:27,750
yeah i mean this is
being hilarious it's like oh these

10248
02:53:27,750 --> 02:53:27,760
being hilarious it's like oh these
 

10249
02:53:27,760 --> 02:53:30,309
being hilarious it's like oh these
things that are just part of our modern

10250
02:53:30,309 --> 02:53:30,319
things that are just part of our modern
 

10251
02:53:30,319 --> 02:53:31,429
things that are just part of our modern
life

10252
02:53:31,429 --> 02:53:31,439
life
 

10253
02:53:31,439 --> 02:53:33,590
life
they're either the same order at least

10254
02:53:33,590 --> 02:53:33,600
they're either the same order at least
 

10255
02:53:33,600 --> 02:53:35,830
they're either the same order at least
the same order of magnitude as bitcoin

10256
02:53:35,830 --> 02:53:35,840
the same order of magnitude as bitcoin
 

10257
02:53:35,840 --> 02:53:39,269
the same order of magnitude as bitcoin
and they seem like trivial parts of life

10258
02:53:39,269 --> 02:53:39,279
and they seem like trivial parts of life
 

10259
02:53:39,279 --> 02:53:40,870
and they seem like trivial parts of life
yeah and this is the thing all the

10260
02:53:40,870 --> 02:53:40,880
yeah and this is the thing all the
 

10261
02:53:40,880 --> 02:53:42,230
yeah and this is the thing all the
people that complain about bitcoin's

10262
02:53:42,230 --> 02:53:42,240
people that complain about bitcoin's
 

10263
02:53:42,240 --> 02:53:44,150
people that complain about bitcoin's
energy consumption i presume they use

10264
02:53:44,150 --> 02:53:44,160
energy consumption i presume they use
 

10265
02:53:44,160 --> 02:53:46,870
energy consumption i presume they use
washing machines now why should their

10266
02:53:46,870 --> 02:53:46,880
washing machines now why should their
 

10267
02:53:46,880 --> 02:53:49,190
washing machines now why should their
desire for clean and dry

10268
02:53:49,190 --> 02:53:49,200
desire for clean and dry
 

10269
02:53:49,200 --> 02:53:50,870
desire for clean and dry
clothes

10270
02:53:50,870 --> 02:53:50,880
clothes
 

10271
02:53:50,880 --> 02:53:52,950
clothes
to get to consume energy and

10272
02:53:52,950 --> 02:53:52,960
to get to consume energy and
 

10273
02:53:52,960 --> 02:53:54,870
to get to consume energy and
i mean i i used to live in lebanon

10274
02:53:54,870 --> 02:53:54,880
i mean i i used to live in lebanon
 

10275
02:53:54,880 --> 02:53:57,030
i mean i i used to live in lebanon
lebanon had hyperinflation i

10276
02:53:57,030 --> 02:53:57,040
lebanon had hyperinflation i
 

10277
02:53:57,040 --> 02:53:59,510
lebanon had hyperinflation i
escaped from hyperinflation i escaped i

10278
02:53:59,510 --> 02:53:59,520
escaped from hyperinflation i escaped i
 

10279
02:53:59,520 --> 02:54:01,590
escaped from hyperinflation i escaped i
it prevented

10280
02:54:01,590 --> 02:54:01,600
it prevented
 

10281
02:54:01,600 --> 02:54:02,710
it prevented
my life could have been ruined by

10282
02:54:02,710 --> 02:54:02,720
my life could have been ruined by
 

10283
02:54:02,720 --> 02:54:04,070
my life could have been ruined by
hyperinflation and the reason that it

10284
02:54:04,070 --> 02:54:04,080
hyperinflation and the reason that it
 

10285
02:54:04,080 --> 02:54:06,150
hyperinflation and the reason that it
wasn't ruined is because i have bitcoin

10286
02:54:06,150 --> 02:54:06,160
wasn't ruined is because i have bitcoin
 

10287
02:54:06,160 --> 02:54:06,870
wasn't ruined is because i have bitcoin
so

10288
02:54:06,870 --> 02:54:06,880
so
 

10289
02:54:06,880 --> 02:54:07,590
so
uh

10290
02:54:07,590 --> 02:54:07,600
uh
 

10291
02:54:07,600 --> 02:54:09,269
uh
i don't know am i allowed to swear on

10292
02:54:09,269 --> 02:54:09,279
i don't know am i allowed to swear on
 

10293
02:54:09,279 --> 02:54:11,269
i don't know am i allowed to swear on
your podcast yes please so your

10294
02:54:11,269 --> 02:54:11,279
your podcast yes please so your
 

10295
02:54:11,279 --> 02:54:13,910
your podcast yes please so your
washing machine

10296
02:54:13,910 --> 02:54:13,920
washing machine
 

10297
02:54:13,920 --> 02:54:16,150
washing machine
uh given a choice between my washing

10298
02:54:16,150 --> 02:54:16,160
uh given a choice between my washing
 

10299
02:54:16,160 --> 02:54:17,670
uh given a choice between my washing
machine and my bitcoin i'll choose

10300
02:54:17,670 --> 02:54:17,680
machine and my bitcoin i'll choose
 

10301
02:54:17,680 --> 02:54:19,910
machine and my bitcoin i'll choose
bitcoin i it's it's a technology that

10302
02:54:19,910 --> 02:54:19,920
bitcoin i it's it's a technology that
 

10303
02:54:19,920 --> 02:54:21,510
bitcoin i it's it's a technology that
has been that has already saved my life

10304
02:54:21,510 --> 02:54:21,520
has been that has already saved my life
 

10305
02:54:21,520 --> 02:54:22,630
has been that has already saved my life
and i think it's going to save the lives

10306
02:54:22,630 --> 02:54:22,640
and i think it's going to save the lives
 

10307
02:54:22,640 --> 02:54:25,190
and i think it's going to save the lives
of many many many many more people so

10308
02:54:25,190 --> 02:54:25,200
of many many many many more people so
 

10309
02:54:25,200 --> 02:54:26,070
of many many many many more people so
um

10310
02:54:26,070 --> 02:54:26,080
um
 

10311
02:54:26,080 --> 02:54:27,349
um
but of course i don't have to choose

10312
02:54:27,349 --> 02:54:27,359
but of course i don't have to choose
 

10313
02:54:27,359 --> 02:54:28,870
but of course i don't have to choose
between um

10314
02:54:28,870 --> 02:54:28,880
between um
 

10315
02:54:28,880 --> 02:54:31,110
between um
my bitcoin and my washing machine

10316
02:54:31,110 --> 02:54:31,120
my bitcoin and my washing machine
 

10317
02:54:31,120 --> 02:54:33,590
my bitcoin and my washing machine
because um this is you know we're just

10318
02:54:33,590 --> 02:54:33,600
because um this is you know we're just
 

10319
02:54:33,600 --> 02:54:35,110
because um this is you know we're just
constantly consuming more energy and

10320
02:54:35,110 --> 02:54:35,120
constantly consuming more energy and
 

10321
02:54:35,120 --> 02:54:36,309
constantly consuming more energy and
we're going to continue to consume more

10322
02:54:36,309 --> 02:54:36,319
we're going to continue to consume more
 

10323
02:54:36,319 --> 02:54:37,750
we're going to continue to consume more
energy in this world

10324
02:54:37,750 --> 02:54:37,760
energy in this world
 

10325
02:54:37,760 --> 02:54:40,389
energy in this world
and that's just what progress is and a

10326
02:54:40,389 --> 02:54:40,399
and that's just what progress is and a
 

10327
02:54:40,399 --> 02:54:42,710
and that's just what progress is and a
small remark so in principle that i

10328
02:54:42,710 --> 02:54:42,720
small remark so in principle that i
 

10329
02:54:42,720 --> 02:54:43,910
small remark so in principle that i
don't think this is a problem but the

10330
02:54:43,910 --> 02:54:43,920
don't think this is a problem but the
 

10331
02:54:43,920 --> 02:54:45,429
don't think this is a problem but the
other thing about bitcoin where it is

10332
02:54:45,429 --> 02:54:45,439
other thing about bitcoin where it is
 

10333
02:54:45,439 --> 02:54:47,349
other thing about bitcoin where it is
different from washing machines

10334
02:54:47,349 --> 02:54:47,359
different from washing machines
 

10335
02:54:47,359 --> 02:54:49,110
different from washing machines
bitcoin is truly unique in this it's the

10336
02:54:49,110 --> 02:54:49,120
bitcoin is truly unique in this it's the
 

10337
02:54:49,120 --> 02:54:50,710
bitcoin is truly unique in this it's the
only thing

10338
02:54:50,710 --> 02:54:50,720
only thing
 

10339
02:54:50,720 --> 02:54:52,790
only thing
whose energy consumption

10340
02:54:52,790 --> 02:54:52,800
whose energy consumption
 

10341
02:54:52,800 --> 02:54:55,349
whose energy consumption
can be produced absolutely anywhere your

10342
02:54:55,349 --> 02:54:55,359
can be produced absolutely anywhere your
 

10343
02:54:55,359 --> 02:54:56,870
can be produced absolutely anywhere your
washing machine needs to be in your

10344
02:54:56,870 --> 02:54:56,880
washing machine needs to be in your
 

10345
02:54:56,880 --> 02:54:58,550
washing machine needs to be in your
house where you live and you live in a

10346
02:54:58,550 --> 02:54:58,560
house where you live and you live in a
 

10347
02:54:58,560 --> 02:55:00,790
house where you live and you live in a
city surrounded by 10 million people and

10348
02:55:00,790 --> 02:55:00,800
city surrounded by 10 million people and
 

10349
02:55:00,800 --> 02:55:02,870
city surrounded by 10 million people and
they all have their washing machines and

10350
02:55:02,870 --> 02:55:02,880
they all have their washing machines and
 

10351
02:55:02,880 --> 02:55:04,550
they all have their washing machines and
they're all connected to the grid and

10352
02:55:04,550 --> 02:55:04,560
they're all connected to the grid and
 

10353
02:55:04,560 --> 02:55:06,389
they're all connected to the grid and
they generally tend to do their laundry

10354
02:55:06,389 --> 02:55:06,399
they generally tend to do their laundry
 

10355
02:55:06,399 --> 02:55:09,510
they generally tend to do their laundry
around the same time and so you have to

10356
02:55:09,510 --> 02:55:09,520
around the same time and so you have to
 

10357
02:55:09,520 --> 02:55:11,670
around the same time and so you have to
put the load of the washing machine on

10358
02:55:11,670 --> 02:55:11,680
put the load of the washing machine on
 

10359
02:55:11,680 --> 02:55:15,030
put the load of the washing machine on
the grid at the same time there's needs

10360
02:55:15,030 --> 02:55:15,040
the grid at the same time there's needs
 

10361
02:55:15,040 --> 02:55:16,870
the grid at the same time there's needs
to be one power plant and all of the

10362
02:55:16,870 --> 02:55:16,880
to be one power plant and all of the
 

10363
02:55:16,880 --> 02:55:18,150
to be one power plant and all of the
infrastructure needs to work at the same

10364
02:55:18,150 --> 02:55:18,160
infrastructure needs to work at the same
 

10365
02:55:18,160 --> 02:55:19,510
infrastructure needs to work at the same
time and the electricity is pretty

10366
02:55:19,510 --> 02:55:19,520
time and the electricity is pretty
 

10367
02:55:19,520 --> 02:55:20,790
time and the electricity is pretty
expensive because

10368
02:55:20,790 --> 02:55:20,800
expensive because
 

10369
02:55:20,800 --> 02:55:22,389
expensive because
it's being done in a place with high

10370
02:55:22,389 --> 02:55:22,399
it's being done in a place with high
 

10371
02:55:22,399 --> 02:55:25,590
it's being done in a place with high
demand bitcoin is does not need to buy

10372
02:55:25,590 --> 02:55:25,600
demand bitcoin is does not need to buy
 

10373
02:55:25,600 --> 02:55:27,030
demand bitcoin is does not need to buy
electricity from

10374
02:55:27,030 --> 02:55:27,040
electricity from
 

10375
02:55:27,040 --> 02:55:28,469
electricity from
places where it has high demand because

10376
02:55:28,469 --> 02:55:28,479
places where it has high demand because
 

10377
02:55:28,479 --> 02:55:30,150
places where it has high demand because
it can buy electricity from anywhere

10378
02:55:30,150 --> 02:55:30,160
it can buy electricity from anywhere
 

10379
02:55:30,160 --> 02:55:31,670
it can buy electricity from anywhere
this is what's truly mind-blowing about

10380
02:55:31,670 --> 02:55:31,680
this is what's truly mind-blowing about
 

10381
02:55:31,680 --> 02:55:35,429
this is what's truly mind-blowing about
it you can buy you know what you need to

10382
02:55:35,429 --> 02:55:35,439
it you can buy you know what you need to
 

10383
02:55:35,439 --> 02:55:37,110
it you can buy you know what you need to
the electricity that you need for mining

10384
02:55:37,110 --> 02:55:37,120
the electricity that you need for mining
 

10385
02:55:37,120 --> 02:55:39,190
the electricity that you need for mining
can be done anywhere so you can

10386
02:55:39,190 --> 02:55:39,200
can be done anywhere so you can
 

10387
02:55:39,200 --> 02:55:41,349
can be done anywhere so you can
mine you know you can have a

10388
02:55:41,349 --> 02:55:41,359
mine you know you can have a
 

10389
02:55:41,359 --> 02:55:43,910
mine you know you can have a
waterfall in the north of canada 300

10390
02:55:43,910 --> 02:55:43,920
waterfall in the north of canada 300
 

10391
02:55:43,920 --> 02:55:46,389
waterfall in the north of canada 300
miles away from any population center

10392
02:55:46,389 --> 02:55:46,399
miles away from any population center
 

10393
02:55:46,399 --> 02:55:48,550
miles away from any population center
there's water falling there's energy you

10394
02:55:48,550 --> 02:55:48,560
there's water falling there's energy you
 

10395
02:55:48,560 --> 02:55:51,030
there's water falling there's energy you
can put a hydroelectric dam there and

10396
02:55:51,030 --> 02:55:51,040
can put a hydroelectric dam there and
 

10397
02:55:51,040 --> 02:55:52,550
can put a hydroelectric dam there and
then you can use that energy to operate

10398
02:55:52,550 --> 02:55:52,560
then you can use that energy to operate
 

10399
02:55:52,560 --> 02:55:54,630
then you can use that energy to operate
the miners and then the miners just need

10400
02:55:54,630 --> 02:55:54,640
the miners and then the miners just need
 

10401
02:55:54,640 --> 02:55:56,710
the miners and then the miners just need
a satellite internet connection and

10402
02:55:56,710 --> 02:55:56,720
a satellite internet connection and
 

10403
02:55:56,720 --> 02:55:58,550
a satellite internet connection and
effectively you're selling that energy

10404
02:55:58,550 --> 02:55:58,560
effectively you're selling that energy
 

10405
02:55:58,560 --> 02:56:01,429
effectively you're selling that energy
that is isolated to the grid and because

10406
02:56:01,429 --> 02:56:01,439
that is isolated to the grid and because
 

10407
02:56:01,439 --> 02:56:03,110
that is isolated to the grid and because
of the way the bitcoin functions because

10408
02:56:03,110 --> 02:56:03,120
of the way the bitcoin functions because
 

10409
02:56:03,120 --> 02:56:04,870
of the way the bitcoin functions because
of the difficulty adjustment

10410
02:56:04,870 --> 02:56:04,880
of the difficulty adjustment
 

10411
02:56:04,880 --> 02:56:07,110
of the difficulty adjustment
the only profitable miners are the ones

10412
02:56:07,110 --> 02:56:07,120
the only profitable miners are the ones
 

10413
02:56:07,120 --> 02:56:09,190
the only profitable miners are the ones
who can get cheap electricity

10414
02:56:09,190 --> 02:56:09,200
who can get cheap electricity
 

10415
02:56:09,200 --> 02:56:11,510
who can get cheap electricity
basically if you're mining at grid cost

10416
02:56:11,510 --> 02:56:11,520
basically if you're mining at grid cost
 

10417
02:56:11,520 --> 02:56:13,510
basically if you're mining at grid cost
if you're mining it around the average

10418
02:56:13,510 --> 02:56:13,520
if you're mining it around the average
 

10419
02:56:13,520 --> 02:56:15,269
if you're mining it around the average
electricity price in the world is around

10420
02:56:15,269 --> 02:56:15,279
electricity price in the world is around
 

10421
02:56:15,279 --> 02:56:16,630
electricity price in the world is around
14 cents

10422
02:56:16,630 --> 02:56:16,640
14 cents
 

10423
02:56:16,640 --> 02:56:19,030
14 cents
if you're mining at 14 cents in bitcoin

10424
02:56:19,030 --> 02:56:19,040
if you're mining at 14 cents in bitcoin
 

10425
02:56:19,040 --> 02:56:21,269
if you're mining at 14 cents in bitcoin
you're most likely not going to make it

10426
02:56:21,269 --> 02:56:21,279
you're most likely not going to make it
 

10427
02:56:21,279 --> 02:56:23,269
you're most likely not going to make it
if you're running your miners at 14

10428
02:56:23,269 --> 02:56:23,279
if you're running your miners at 14
 

10429
02:56:23,279 --> 02:56:25,510
if you're running your miners at 14
cents because everybody could mine at 14

10430
02:56:25,510 --> 02:56:25,520
cents because everybody could mine at 14
 

10431
02:56:25,520 --> 02:56:27,830
cents because everybody could mine at 14
cents and so what happens is if

10432
02:56:27,830 --> 02:56:27,840
cents and so what happens is if
 

10433
02:56:27,840 --> 02:56:30,309
cents and so what happens is if
everybody's mining at 14 cents

10434
02:56:30,309 --> 02:56:30,319
everybody's mining at 14 cents
 

10435
02:56:30,319 --> 02:56:32,950
everybody's mining at 14 cents
14 cents stops being profitable and then

10436
02:56:32,950 --> 02:56:32,960
14 cents stops being profitable and then
 

10437
02:56:32,960 --> 02:56:34,710
14 cents stops being profitable and then
only the people mining at a lower price

10438
02:56:34,710 --> 02:56:34,720
only the people mining at a lower price
 

10439
02:56:34,720 --> 02:56:36,550
only the people mining at a lower price
are profitable so that's why

10440
02:56:36,550 --> 02:56:36,560
are profitable so that's why
 

10441
02:56:36,560 --> 02:56:38,309
are profitable so that's why
bitcoin mining is not competing with

10442
02:56:38,309 --> 02:56:38,319
bitcoin mining is not competing with
 

10443
02:56:38,319 --> 02:56:40,230
bitcoin mining is not competing with
your washing machine this is this is the

your washing machine this is this is the
 

10445
02:56:40,240 --> 02:56:42,389

absurd thing about this kind of energy

10446
02:56:42,389 --> 02:56:42,399
absurd thing about this kind of energy
 

10447
02:56:42,399 --> 02:56:44,790
absurd thing about this kind of energy

infrastructure for bitcoin mining you
 

10721
03:01:13,200 --> 03:01:15,590
infrastructure for bitcoin mining you
don't see it in the cities it's all

10722
03:01:15,590 --> 03:01:15,600
don't see it in the cities it's all
 

10723
03:01:15,600 --> 03:01:17,910
don't see it in the cities it's all
isolated it's all out away from the

isolated it's all out away from the
 

10725
03:01:17,920 --> 03:01:20,230
isolated it's all out away from the
cities or it's connected to grids that

10726
03:01:20,230 --> 03:01:20,240
cities or it's connected to grids that
 

10727
03:01:20,240 --> 03:01:23,110
cities or it's connected to grids that
have serious over capacity so bitcoin is

10728
03:01:23,110 --> 03:01:23,120
have serious over capacity so bitcoin is
 

10729
03:01:23,120 --> 03:01:24,710

not out there buying the expensive

10730
03:01:24,710 --> 03:01:24,720
not out there buying the expensive
 

10731
03:01:24,720 --> 03:01:27,269
not out there buying the expensive
energy taking energy away from uh

10732
03:01:27,269 --> 03:01:27,279
energy taking energy away from uh
 

10733
03:01:27,279 --> 03:01:29,030
energy taking energy away from uh
people who can't afford it

10734
03:01:29,030 --> 03:01:29,040
people who can't afford it
 

10735
03:01:29,040 --> 03:01:30,790
people who can't afford it
it's out there buying its own energy

10736
03:01:30,790 --> 03:01:30,800
it's out there buying its own energy
 

10737
03:01:30,800 --> 03:01:31,910
it's out there buying its own energy
because it doesn't need to buy the

10738
03:01:31,910 --> 03:01:31,920
because it doesn't need to buy the
 

10739
03:01:31,920 --> 03:01:34,230
because it doesn't need to buy the
expensive energy that people really need

10740
03:01:34,230 --> 03:01:34,240
expensive energy that people really need
 

10741
03:01:34,240 --> 03:01:36,309
expensive energy that people really need
so one other criticism from an

10742
03:01:36,309 --> 03:01:36,319
so one other criticism from an
 

10743
03:01:36,319 --> 03:01:38,070
so one other criticism from an
investment perspective from a gambling

10744
03:01:38,070 --> 03:01:38,080
investment perspective from a gambling
 

10745
03:01:38,080 --> 03:01:39,590
investment perspective from a gambling
perspective that people see is the

10746
03:01:39,590 --> 03:01:39,600
perspective that people see is the
 

10747
03:01:39,600 --> 03:01:41,510
perspective that people see is the
volatility of bitcoin

10748
03:01:41,510 --> 03:01:41,520
volatility of bitcoin
 

10749
03:01:41,520 --> 03:01:42,870
volatility of bitcoin
of course that's been somewhat

10750
03:01:42,870 --> 03:01:42,880
of course that's been somewhat
 

10751
03:01:42,880 --> 03:01:45,429
of course that's been somewhat
decreasing over time but uh

10752
03:01:45,429 --> 03:01:45,439
decreasing over time but uh
 

10753
03:01:45,439 --> 03:01:47,590
decreasing over time but uh
what's your answer to the

10754
03:01:47,590 --> 03:01:47,600
what's your answer to the
 

10755
03:01:47,600 --> 03:01:49,429
what's your answer to the
sort of criticism that bitcoin is too

10756
03:01:49,429 --> 03:01:49,439
sort of criticism that bitcoin is too
 

10757
03:01:49,439 --> 03:01:51,590
sort of criticism that bitcoin is too
volatile i want to stay away it doesn't

10758
03:01:51,590 --> 03:01:51,600
volatile i want to stay away it doesn't
 

10759
03:01:51,600 --> 03:01:54,150
volatile i want to stay away it doesn't
seem like a safe place for me to

10760
03:01:54,150 --> 03:01:54,160
seem like a safe place for me to
 

10761
03:01:54,160 --> 03:01:56,950
seem like a safe place for me to
invest either short term or long term

10762
03:01:56,950 --> 03:01:56,960
invest either short term or long term
 

10763
03:01:56,960 --> 03:01:58,469
invest either short term or long term
there's no denying there's a volatility

10764
03:01:58,469 --> 03:01:58,479
there's no denying there's a volatility
 

10765
03:01:58,479 --> 03:01:59,910
there's no denying there's a volatility
and there's a high oscillation in the

10766
03:01:59,910 --> 03:01:59,920
and there's a high oscillation in the
 

10767
03:01:59,920 --> 03:02:02,550
and there's a high oscillation in the
value in the short term so um i think

10768
03:02:02,550 --> 03:02:02,560
value in the short term so um i think
 

10769
03:02:02,560 --> 03:02:05,670
value in the short term so um i think
the the the safe way to approach that is

10770
03:02:05,670 --> 03:02:05,680
the the the safe way to approach that is
 

10771
03:02:05,680 --> 03:02:07,910
the the the safe way to approach that is
in terms of position sizing uh

10772
03:02:07,910 --> 03:02:07,920
in terms of position sizing uh
 

10773
03:02:07,920 --> 03:02:11,030
in terms of position sizing uh
if the volatility bothers you then

10774
03:02:11,030 --> 03:02:11,040
if the volatility bothers you then
 

10775
03:02:11,040 --> 03:02:12,950
if the volatility bothers you then
you're over invested perhaps so maybe

10776
03:02:12,950 --> 03:02:12,960
you're over invested perhaps so maybe
 

10777
03:02:12,960 --> 03:02:14,710
you're over invested perhaps so maybe
you should

10778
03:02:14,710 --> 03:02:14,720
you should
 

10779
03:02:14,720 --> 03:02:16,870
you should
maybe you should reduce the size of your

10780
03:02:16,870 --> 03:02:16,880
maybe you should reduce the size of your
 

10781
03:02:16,880 --> 03:02:18,870
maybe you should reduce the size of your
position so that the volatility doesn't

10782
03:02:18,870 --> 03:02:18,880
position so that the volatility doesn't
 

10783
03:02:18,880 --> 03:02:20,870
position so that the volatility doesn't
bother you

10784
03:02:20,870 --> 03:02:20,880
bother you
 

10785
03:02:20,880 --> 03:02:22,230
bother you
this is this is the short answer that

10786
03:02:22,230 --> 03:02:22,240
this is this is the short answer that
 

10787
03:02:22,240 --> 03:02:23,190
this is this is the short answer that
you know

10788
03:02:23,190 --> 03:02:23,200
you know
 

10789
03:02:23,200 --> 03:02:24,550
you know
like

10790
03:02:24,550 --> 03:02:24,560
like
 

10791
03:02:24,560 --> 03:02:26,790
like
stack as much as your conviction will

10792
03:02:26,790 --> 03:02:26,800
stack as much as your conviction will
 

10793
03:02:26,800 --> 03:02:29,590
stack as much as your conviction will
allow you to tolerate the volatility um

10794
03:02:29,590 --> 03:02:29,600
allow you to tolerate the volatility um
 

10795
03:02:29,600 --> 03:02:30,870
allow you to tolerate the volatility um
but

10796
03:02:30,870 --> 03:02:30,880
but
 

10797
03:02:30,880 --> 03:02:33,190
but
and of course the reason you should try

10798
03:02:33,190 --> 03:02:33,200
and of course the reason you should try
 

10799
03:02:33,200 --> 03:02:35,670
and of course the reason you should try
and consider tolerating volatility

10800
03:02:35,670 --> 03:02:35,680
and consider tolerating volatility
 

10801
03:02:35,680 --> 03:02:37,349
and consider tolerating volatility
more is

10802
03:02:37,349 --> 03:02:37,359
more is
 

10803
03:02:37,359 --> 03:02:40,309
more is
the options are you hold fiat assets

10804
03:02:40,309 --> 03:02:40,319
the options are you hold fiat assets
 

10805
03:02:40,319 --> 03:02:42,790
the options are you hold fiat assets
which only go down stable you know

10806
03:02:42,790 --> 03:02:42,800
which only go down stable you know
 

10807
03:02:42,800 --> 03:02:44,150
which only go down stable you know
relatively stable not a lot of

10808
03:02:44,150 --> 03:02:44,160
relatively stable not a lot of
 

10809
03:02:44,160 --> 03:02:47,030
relatively stable not a lot of
volatility day-to-day you know value of

10810
03:02:47,030 --> 03:02:47,040
volatility day-to-day you know value of
 

10811
03:02:47,040 --> 03:02:50,469
volatility day-to-day you know value of
your dollar doesn't change 40 overnight

10812
03:02:50,469 --> 03:02:50,479
your dollar doesn't change 40 overnight
 

10813
03:02:50,479 --> 03:02:52,790
your dollar doesn't change 40 overnight
20 overnight or something like that

10814
03:02:52,790 --> 03:02:52,800
20 overnight or something like that
 

10815
03:02:52,800 --> 03:02:54,710
20 overnight or something like that
but it does go down reliably it's going

10816
03:02:54,710 --> 03:02:54,720
but it does go down reliably it's going
 

10817
03:02:54,720 --> 03:02:56,710
but it does go down reliably it's going
to go down 40 percent you can count on

10818
03:02:56,710 --> 03:02:56,720
to go down 40 percent you can count on
 

10819
03:02:56,720 --> 03:02:58,630
to go down 40 percent you can count on
it it might take a year two years five

10820
03:02:58,630 --> 03:02:58,640
it it might take a year two years five
 

10821
03:02:58,640 --> 03:03:00,550
it it might take a year two years five
years ten years compared to the things

10822
03:03:00,550 --> 03:03:00,560
years ten years compared to the things
 

10823
03:03:00,560 --> 03:03:02,230
years ten years compared to the things
that you want to buy it's going to go

10824
03:03:02,230 --> 03:03:02,240
that you want to buy it's going to go
 

10825
03:03:02,240 --> 03:03:04,309
that you want to buy it's going to go
down by 40 percent

10826
03:03:04,309 --> 03:03:04,319
down by 40 percent
 

10827
03:03:04,319 --> 03:03:05,990
down by 40 percent
and it's not going to come back and it's

10828
03:03:05,990 --> 03:03:06,000
and it's not going to come back and it's
 

10829
03:03:06,000 --> 03:03:07,510
and it's not going to come back and it's
going to go down another 40 percent and

10830
03:03:07,510 --> 03:03:07,520
going to go down another 40 percent and
 

10831
03:03:07,520 --> 03:03:09,910
going to go down another 40 percent and
then another 40 and another 40 so the

10832
03:03:09,910 --> 03:03:09,920
then another 40 and another 40 so the
 

10833
03:03:09,920 --> 03:03:13,030
then another 40 and another 40 so the
option really is

10834
03:03:13,030 --> 03:03:13,040

 

10835
03:03:13,040 --> 03:03:14,950

relatively short-term stability with

10836
03:03:14,950 --> 03:03:14,960
relatively short-term stability with
 

10837
03:03:14,960 --> 03:03:17,269
relatively short-term stability with
long-term decline or short-term

10838
03:03:17,269 --> 03:03:17,279
long-term decline or short-term
 

10839
03:03:17,279 --> 03:03:19,670
long-term decline or short-term
volatility with long-term rise

10840
03:03:19,670 --> 03:03:19,680
volatility with long-term rise
 

10841
03:03:19,680 --> 03:03:20,710
volatility with long-term rise
and so

10842
03:03:20,710 --> 03:03:20,720
and so
 

10843
03:03:20,720 --> 03:03:22,070
and so
that's another way in which bitcoin

10844
03:03:22,070 --> 03:03:22,080
that's another way in which bitcoin
 

10845
03:03:22,080 --> 03:03:23,429
that's another way in which bitcoin
teaches people to have a low time

10846
03:03:23,429 --> 03:03:23,439
teaches people to have a low time
 

10847
03:03:23,439 --> 03:03:24,830
teaches people to have a low time
preference and think about the long term

10848
03:03:24,830 --> 03:03:24,840
preference and think about the long term
 

10849
03:03:24,840 --> 03:03:27,910
preference and think about the long term
so stack accumulate and think of it in

10850
03:03:27,910 --> 03:03:27,920
so stack accumulate and think of it in
 

10851
03:03:27,920 --> 03:03:29,190
so stack accumulate and think of it in
the long term

10852
03:03:29,190 --> 03:03:29,200
the long term
 

10853
03:03:29,200 --> 03:03:30,469
the long term
it's a function of the fact that bitcoin

10854
03:03:30,469 --> 03:03:30,479
it's a function of the fact that bitcoin
 

10855
03:03:30,479 --> 03:03:32,389
it's a function of the fact that bitcoin
is new bitcoin is currently less than

10856
03:03:32,389 --> 03:03:32,399
is new bitcoin is currently less than
 

10857
03:03:32,399 --> 03:03:34,150
is new bitcoin is currently less than
one percent of the global money market

10858
03:03:34,150 --> 03:03:34,160
one percent of the global money market
 

10859
03:03:34,160 --> 03:03:35,429
one percent of the global money market
so there's about a hundred trillion

10860
03:03:35,429 --> 03:03:35,439
so there's about a hundred trillion
 

10861
03:03:35,439 --> 03:03:38,150
so there's about a hundred trillion
dollars of money out there in the world

10862
03:03:38,150 --> 03:03:38,160
dollars of money out there in the world
 

10863
03:03:38,160 --> 03:03:40,150
dollars of money out there in the world
um a hundred trillion dollars roughly of

10864
03:03:40,150 --> 03:03:40,160
um a hundred trillion dollars roughly of
 

10865
03:03:40,160 --> 03:03:42,150
um a hundred trillion dollars roughly of
fiat and about 10 trillion dollars of

10866
03:03:42,150 --> 03:03:42,160
fiat and about 10 trillion dollars of
 

10867
03:03:42,160 --> 03:03:44,070
fiat and about 10 trillion dollars of
gold and bitcoin is less than one

10868
03:03:44,070 --> 03:03:44,080
gold and bitcoin is less than one
 

10869
03:03:44,080 --> 03:03:45,750
gold and bitcoin is less than one
trillion dollars so

10870
03:03:45,750 --> 03:03:45,760
trillion dollars so
 

10871
03:03:45,760 --> 03:03:47,510
trillion dollars so
you know one rich guy decides to get

10872
03:03:47,510 --> 03:03:47,520
you know one rich guy decides to get
 

10873
03:03:47,520 --> 03:03:49,349
you know one rich guy decides to get
into bitcoin that's gonna show up on the

10874
03:03:49,349 --> 03:03:49,359
into bitcoin that's gonna show up on the
 

10875
03:03:49,359 --> 03:03:51,110
into bitcoin that's gonna show up on the
bitcoin chart you look at it you know

10876
03:03:51,110 --> 03:03:51,120
bitcoin chart you look at it you know
 

10877
03:03:51,120 --> 03:03:53,349
bitcoin chart you look at it you know
elon musk decides to buy bitcoin you see

10878
03:03:53,349 --> 03:03:53,359
elon musk decides to buy bitcoin you see
 

10879
03:03:53,359 --> 03:03:55,269
elon musk decides to buy bitcoin you see
the buy you know you see the news it

10880
03:03:55,269 --> 03:03:55,279
the buy you know you see the news it
 

10881
03:03:55,279 --> 03:03:57,429
the buy you know you see the news it
happens and you see the pump

10882
03:03:57,429 --> 03:03:57,439
happens and you see the pump
 

10883
03:03:57,439 --> 03:03:59,030
happens and you see the pump
um he almost decides that he doesn't

10884
03:03:59,030 --> 03:03:59,040
um he almost decides that he doesn't
 

10885
03:03:59,040 --> 03:04:01,110
um he almost decides that he doesn't
like bitcoin you see the drop

10886
03:04:01,110 --> 03:04:01,120
like bitcoin you see the drop
 

10887
03:04:01,120 --> 03:04:02,950
like bitcoin you see the drop
but you know a few years ago it used to

10888
03:04:02,950 --> 03:04:02,960
but you know a few years ago it used to
 

10889
03:04:02,960 --> 03:04:05,590
but you know a few years ago it used to
be that one random millionaire

10890
03:04:05,590 --> 03:04:05,600
be that one random millionaire
 

10891
03:04:05,600 --> 03:04:07,830
be that one random millionaire
would cause that pump now you have to be

10892
03:04:07,830 --> 03:04:07,840
would cause that pump now you have to be
 

10893
03:04:07,840 --> 03:04:09,670
would cause that pump now you have to be
the richest guy in the world to do that

10894
03:04:09,670 --> 03:04:09,680
the richest guy in the world to do that
 

10895
03:04:09,680 --> 03:04:11,510
the richest guy in the world to do that
in a few years you're gonna have to be

10896
03:04:11,510 --> 03:04:11,520
in a few years you're gonna have to be
 

10897
03:04:11,520 --> 03:04:13,110
in a few years you're gonna have to be
the richest country in the world to be

10898
03:04:13,110 --> 03:04:13,120
the richest country in the world to be
 

10899
03:04:13,120 --> 03:04:14,870
the richest country in the world to be
able to do that to the bitcoin price

10900
03:04:14,870 --> 03:04:14,880
able to do that to the bitcoin price
 

10901
03:04:14,880 --> 03:04:17,030
able to do that to the bitcoin price
maybe many years maybe not a few years

10902
03:04:17,030 --> 03:04:17,040
maybe many years maybe not a few years
 

10903
03:04:17,040 --> 03:04:18,710
maybe many years maybe not a few years
but as bitcoin grows you know think

10904
03:04:18,710 --> 03:04:18,720
but as bitcoin grows you know think
 

10905
03:04:18,720 --> 03:04:22,070
but as bitcoin grows you know think
about it as a a liquid pool of money

10906
03:04:22,070 --> 03:04:22,080
about it as a a liquid pool of money
 

10907
03:04:22,080 --> 03:04:23,830
about it as a a liquid pool of money
currently it's a small pool next to a

10908
03:04:23,830 --> 03:04:23,840
currently it's a small pool next to a
 

10909
03:04:23,840 --> 03:04:26,070
currently it's a small pool next to a
much larger ocean which is the entire

10910
03:04:26,070 --> 03:04:26,080
much larger ocean which is the entire
 

10911
03:04:26,080 --> 03:04:27,750
much larger ocean which is the entire
money market and so

10912
03:04:27,750 --> 03:04:27,760
money market and so
 

10913
03:04:27,760 --> 03:04:30,070
money market and so
one person jumps from that to this small

10914
03:04:30,070 --> 03:04:30,080
one person jumps from that to this small
 

10915
03:04:30,080 --> 03:04:32,389
one person jumps from that to this small
pool they can make a big splash as the

10916
03:04:32,389 --> 03:04:32,399
pool they can make a big splash as the
 

10917
03:04:32,399 --> 03:04:34,950
pool they can make a big splash as the
pool grows essentially the sailbility

10918
03:04:34,950 --> 03:04:34,960
pool grows essentially the sailbility
 

10919
03:04:34,960 --> 03:04:37,750
pool grows essentially the sailbility
increases and the likelihood of one

10920
03:04:37,750 --> 03:04:37,760
increases and the likelihood of one
 

10921
03:04:37,760 --> 03:04:39,590
increases and the likelihood of one
individual purchase affecting the price

10922
03:04:39,590 --> 03:04:39,600
individual purchase affecting the price
 

10923
03:04:39,600 --> 03:04:41,830
individual purchase affecting the price
so violently increases

10924
03:04:41,830 --> 03:04:41,840
so violently increases
 

10925
03:04:41,840 --> 03:04:43,190
so violently increases
decreases

10926
03:04:43,190 --> 03:04:43,200
decreases
 

10927
03:04:43,200 --> 03:04:45,269
decreases
and so over time you know as the size of

10928
03:04:45,269 --> 03:04:45,279
and so over time you know as the size of
 

10929
03:04:45,279 --> 03:04:46,710
and so over time you know as the size of
the market increases

10930
03:04:46,710 --> 03:04:46,720
the market increases
 

10931
03:04:46,720 --> 03:04:47,750
the market increases
i think we're going to see the

10932
03:04:47,750 --> 03:04:47,760
i think we're going to see the
 

10933
03:04:47,760 --> 03:04:49,510
i think we're going to see the
volatility decline more and more

10934
03:04:49,510 --> 03:04:49,520
volatility decline more and more
 

10935
03:04:49,520 --> 03:04:50,710
volatility decline more and more
ultimately

10936
03:04:50,710 --> 03:04:50,720
ultimately
 

10937
03:04:50,720 --> 03:04:52,150
ultimately
what you know if you look at gold

10938
03:04:52,150 --> 03:04:52,160
what you know if you look at gold
 

10939
03:04:52,160 --> 03:04:53,750
what you know if you look at gold
historically gold has been very very

10940
03:04:53,750 --> 03:04:53,760
historically gold has been very very
 

10941
03:04:53,760 --> 03:04:56,230
historically gold has been very very
stable it did not achieve its stability

10942
03:04:56,230 --> 03:04:56,240
stable it did not achieve its stability
 

10943
03:04:56,240 --> 03:04:57,590
stable it did not achieve its stability
because the central bank was in charge

10944
03:04:57,590 --> 03:04:57,600
because the central bank was in charge
 

10945
03:04:57,600 --> 03:04:59,830
because the central bank was in charge
of gold supply or because there was a

10946
03:04:59,830 --> 03:04:59,840
of gold supply or because there was a
 

10947
03:04:59,840 --> 03:05:01,510
of gold supply or because there was a
gold committee that decided how much

10948
03:05:01,510 --> 03:05:01,520
gold committee that decided how much
 

10949
03:05:01,520 --> 03:05:03,750
gold committee that decided how much
gold gets produced

10950
03:05:03,750 --> 03:05:03,760
gold gets produced
 

10951
03:05:03,760 --> 03:05:05,910
gold gets produced
it achieved that stability because it

10952
03:05:05,910 --> 03:05:05,920
it achieved that stability because it
 

10953
03:05:05,920 --> 03:05:08,389
it achieved that stability because it
became the most saleable good and so

10954
03:05:08,389 --> 03:05:08,399
became the most saleable good and so
 

10955
03:05:08,399 --> 03:05:10,309
became the most saleable good and so
therefore became the good that contains

10956
03:05:10,309 --> 03:05:10,319
therefore became the good that contains
 

10957
03:05:10,319 --> 03:05:12,870
therefore became the good that contains
the most cash balances in the world and

10958
03:05:12,870 --> 03:05:12,880
the most cash balances in the world and
 

10959
03:05:12,880 --> 03:05:14,389
the most cash balances in the world and
the end of the 19th century everybody

10960
03:05:14,389 --> 03:05:14,399
the end of the 19th century everybody
 

10961
03:05:14,399 --> 03:05:16,710
the end of the 19th century everybody
held cash balances in gold

10962
03:05:16,710 --> 03:05:16,720
held cash balances in gold
 

10963
03:05:16,720 --> 03:05:19,429
held cash balances in gold
and the new production was a tiny little

10964
03:05:19,429 --> 03:05:19,439
and the new production was a tiny little
 

10965
03:05:19,439 --> 03:05:22,550
and the new production was a tiny little
uh addition to global production to the

10966
03:05:22,550 --> 03:05:22,560
uh addition to global production to the
 

10967
03:05:22,560 --> 03:05:26,150
uh addition to global production to the
supply so that's what made gold the most

10968
03:05:26,150 --> 03:05:26,160
supply so that's what made gold the most
 

10969
03:05:26,160 --> 03:05:27,750
supply so that's what made gold the most
relatively i shouldn't stay stable

10970
03:05:27,750 --> 03:05:27,760
relatively i shouldn't stay stable
 

10971
03:05:27,760 --> 03:05:29,590
relatively i shouldn't stay stable
because nothing is stable in economics

10972
03:05:29,590 --> 03:05:29,600
because nothing is stable in economics
 

10973
03:05:29,600 --> 03:05:31,750
because nothing is stable in economics
but relatively it holds on to its value

10974
03:05:31,750 --> 03:05:31,760
but relatively it holds on to its value
 

10975
03:05:31,760 --> 03:05:34,150
but relatively it holds on to its value
and it's much less volatile than

10976
03:05:34,150 --> 03:05:34,160
and it's much less volatile than
 

10977
03:05:34,160 --> 03:05:35,590
and it's much less volatile than
digital currency than national

10978
03:05:35,590 --> 03:05:35,600
digital currency than national
 

10979
03:05:35,600 --> 03:05:37,110
digital currency than national
currencies

10980
03:05:37,110 --> 03:05:37,120
currencies
 

10981
03:05:37,120 --> 03:05:38,630
currencies
that's because

10982
03:05:38,630 --> 03:05:38,640
that's because
 

10983
03:05:38,640 --> 03:05:41,190
that's because
it has the highest stock to flow ratio

10984
03:05:41,190 --> 03:05:41,200
it has the highest stock to flow ratio
 

10985
03:05:41,200 --> 03:05:44,790
it has the highest stock to flow ratio
and that's because its supply is

10986
03:05:44,790 --> 03:05:44,800
and that's because its supply is
 

10987
03:05:44,800 --> 03:05:47,349
and that's because its supply is
a tiny fraction of the liquid market and

10988
03:05:47,349 --> 03:05:47,359
a tiny fraction of the liquid market and
 

10989
03:05:47,359 --> 03:05:49,269
a tiny fraction of the liquid market and
as the liquid market grows as the size

10990
03:05:49,269 --> 03:05:49,279
as the liquid market grows as the size
 

10991
03:05:49,279 --> 03:05:51,190
as the liquid market grows as the size
of cash balances grows and trades in

10992
03:05:51,190 --> 03:05:51,200
of cash balances grows and trades in
 

10993
03:05:51,200 --> 03:05:53,349
of cash balances grows and trades in
bitcoin cancel each other out

10994
03:05:53,349 --> 03:05:53,359
bitcoin cancel each other out
 

10995
03:05:53,359 --> 03:05:54,150
bitcoin cancel each other out
um

10996
03:05:54,150 --> 03:05:54,160
um
 

10997
03:05:54,160 --> 03:05:55,190
um
you get

10998
03:05:55,190 --> 03:05:55,200
you get
 

10999
03:05:55,200 --> 03:05:57,830
you get
only slight changes in value so i think

11000
03:05:57,830 --> 03:05:57,840
only slight changes in value so i think
 

11001
03:05:57,840 --> 03:05:59,750
only slight changes in value so i think
as bitcoin matures

11002
03:05:59,750 --> 03:05:59,760
as bitcoin matures
 

11003
03:05:59,760 --> 03:06:01,750
as bitcoin matures
that's going to decline so effectively i

11004
03:06:01,750 --> 03:06:01,760
that's going to decline so effectively i
 

11005
03:06:01,760 --> 03:06:03,750
that's going to decline so effectively i
think you know the the the end game is

11006
03:06:03,750 --> 03:06:03,760
think you know the the the end game is
 

11007
03:06:03,760 --> 03:06:05,190
think you know the the the end game is
bitcoin is

11008
03:06:05,190 --> 03:06:05,200
bitcoin is
 

11009
03:06:05,200 --> 03:06:06,230
bitcoin is
um

11010
03:06:06,230 --> 03:06:06,240
um
 

11011
03:06:06,240 --> 03:06:08,230
um
huge you know bitcoin is worth something

11012
03:06:08,230 --> 03:06:08,240
huge you know bitcoin is worth something
 

11013
03:06:08,240 --> 03:06:10,469
huge you know bitcoin is worth something
like i i think the total addressable

11014
03:06:10,469 --> 03:06:10,479
like i i think the total addressable
 

11015
03:06:10,479 --> 03:06:12,550
like i i think the total addressable
market for bitcoin is

11016
03:06:12,550 --> 03:06:12,560
market for bitcoin is
 

11017
03:06:12,560 --> 03:06:14,550
market for bitcoin is
not just national currencies and gold's

11018
03:06:14,550 --> 03:06:14,560
not just national currencies and gold's
 

11019
03:06:14,560 --> 03:06:16,150
not just national currencies and gold's
addressable market but also government

11020
03:06:16,150 --> 03:06:16,160
addressable market but also government
 

11021
03:06:16,160 --> 03:06:18,630
addressable market but also government
bonds that's the really big one so

11022
03:06:18,630 --> 03:06:18,640
bonds that's the really big one so
 

11023
03:06:18,640 --> 03:06:20,309
bonds that's the really big one so
how do banks compare to gold so you're

11024
03:06:20,309 --> 03:06:20,319
how do banks compare to gold so you're
 

11025
03:06:20,319 --> 03:06:22,469
how do banks compare to gold so you're
saying it'll surpass gold with the 10

11026
03:06:22,469 --> 03:06:22,479
saying it'll surpass gold with the 10
 

11027
03:06:22,479 --> 03:06:25,190
saying it'll surpass gold with the 10
trillion yeah what's bonds

11028
03:06:25,190 --> 03:06:25,200
trillion yeah what's bonds
 

11029
03:06:25,200 --> 03:06:26,870
trillion yeah what's bonds
where's bonds stand

11030
03:06:26,870 --> 03:06:26,880
where's bonds stand
 

11031
03:06:26,880 --> 03:06:28,710
where's bonds stand
so then there's also national currencies

11032
03:06:28,710 --> 03:06:28,720
so then there's also national currencies
 

11033
03:06:28,720 --> 03:06:30,150
so then there's also national currencies
which are about a hundred trillion and

11034
03:06:30,150 --> 03:06:30,160
which are about a hundred trillion and
 

11035
03:06:30,160 --> 03:06:31,429
which are about a hundred trillion and
there's government bonds which are

11036
03:06:31,429 --> 03:06:31,439
there's government bonds which are
 

11037
03:06:31,439 --> 03:06:34,790
there's government bonds which are
around 120 billion dollars

11038
03:06:34,790 --> 03:06:34,800
around 120 billion dollars
 

11039
03:06:34,800 --> 03:06:36,870
around 120 billion dollars
and sorry trillion dollars trillion two

11040
03:06:36,870 --> 03:06:36,880
and sorry trillion dollars trillion two
 

11041
03:06:36,880 --> 03:06:38,550
and sorry trillion dollars trillion two
trillion sorry yes we're saying if we're

11042
03:06:38,550 --> 03:06:38,560
trillion sorry yes we're saying if we're
 

11043
03:06:38,560 --> 03:06:42,710
trillion sorry yes we're saying if we're
saying billion we meant trillion yeah uh

11044
03:06:42,710 --> 03:06:42,720
saying billion we meant trillion yeah uh
 

11045
03:06:42,720 --> 03:06:43,750
saying billion we meant trillion yeah uh
so you think

11046
03:06:43,750 --> 03:06:43,760
so you think
 

11047
03:06:43,760 --> 03:06:46,710
so you think
uh bonds can move to bitcoin i've always

11048
03:06:46,710 --> 03:06:46,720
uh bonds can move to bitcoin i've always
 

11049
03:06:46,720 --> 03:06:48,710
uh bonds can move to bitcoin i've always
held this is this is the prize this is

11050
03:06:48,710 --> 03:06:48,720
held this is this is the prize this is
 

11051
03:06:48,720 --> 03:06:50,550
held this is this is the prize this is
the main dish and the gold is the

11052
03:06:50,550 --> 03:06:50,560
the main dish and the gold is the
 

11053
03:06:50,560 --> 03:06:52,630
the main dish and the gold is the
appetizer bonds are the main dish

11054
03:06:52,630 --> 03:06:52,640
appetizer bonds are the main dish
 

11055
03:06:52,640 --> 03:06:55,990
appetizer bonds are the main dish
because bonds have replaced

11056
03:06:55,990 --> 03:06:56,000
because bonds have replaced
 

11057
03:06:56,000 --> 03:06:58,950
because bonds have replaced
yeah i mean bonds have replaced gold in

11058
03:06:58,950 --> 03:06:58,960
yeah i mean bonds have replaced gold in
 

11059
03:06:58,960 --> 03:07:00,469
yeah i mean bonds have replaced gold in
people's portfolio people you remember

11060
03:07:00,469 --> 03:07:00,479
people's portfolio people you remember
 

11061
03:07:00,479 --> 03:07:03,030
people's portfolio people you remember
when we were saying gold was um you'd

11062
03:07:03,030 --> 03:07:03,040
when we were saying gold was um you'd
 

11063
03:07:03,040 --> 03:07:04,710
when we were saying gold was um you'd
hold it as a saving as the secure part

11064
03:07:04,710 --> 03:07:04,720
hold it as a saving as the secure part
 

11065
03:07:04,720 --> 03:07:06,230
hold it as a saving as the secure part
of your portfolio and then you take risk

11066
03:07:06,230 --> 03:07:06,240
of your portfolio and then you take risk
 

11067
03:07:06,240 --> 03:07:07,990
of your portfolio and then you take risk
with the equity

11068
03:07:07,990 --> 03:07:08,000
with the equity
 

11069
03:07:08,000 --> 03:07:09,830
with the equity
currently people do that by holding a

11070
03:07:09,830 --> 03:07:09,840
currently people do that by holding a
 

11071
03:07:09,840 --> 03:07:11,590
currently people do that by holding a
part of their portfolio in bonds that's

11072
03:07:11,590 --> 03:07:11,600
part of their portfolio in bonds that's
 

11073
03:07:11,600 --> 03:07:13,750
part of their portfolio in bonds that's
the part that they treat as their saving

11074
03:07:13,750 --> 03:07:13,760
the part that they treat as their saving
 

11075
03:07:13,760 --> 03:07:16,469
the part that they treat as their saving
account and then the rest they use for

11076
03:07:16,469 --> 03:07:16,479
account and then the rest they use for
 

11077
03:07:16,479 --> 03:07:18,710
account and then the rest they use for
uh specul not speculation for investment

11078
03:07:18,710 --> 03:07:18,720
uh specul not speculation for investment
 

11079
03:07:18,720 --> 03:07:20,070
uh specul not speculation for investment
in which they take risk and yeah

11080
03:07:20,070 --> 03:07:20,080
in which they take risk and yeah
 

11081
03:07:20,080 --> 03:07:21,269
in which they take risk and yeah
speculation

11082
03:07:21,269 --> 03:07:21,279
speculation
 

11083
03:07:21,279 --> 03:07:24,550
speculation
and that's stocks and equity and

11084
03:07:24,550 --> 03:07:24,560
and that's stocks and equity and
 

11085
03:07:24,560 --> 03:07:26,309
and that's stocks and equity and
other high-risk

11086
03:07:26,309 --> 03:07:26,319
other high-risk
 

11087
03:07:26,319 --> 03:07:27,269
other high-risk
assets

11088
03:07:27,269 --> 03:07:27,279
assets
 

11089
03:07:27,279 --> 03:07:29,190
assets
i think bitcoin is not going to replace

11090
03:07:29,190 --> 03:07:29,200
i think bitcoin is not going to replace
 

11091
03:07:29,200 --> 03:07:30,790
i think bitcoin is not going to replace
equity there will always be equity there

11092
03:07:30,790 --> 03:07:30,800
equity there will always be equity there
 

11093
03:07:30,800 --> 03:07:32,070
equity there will always be equity there
will always be companies and people who

11094
03:07:32,070 --> 03:07:32,080
will always be companies and people who
 

11095
03:07:32,080 --> 03:07:33,910
will always be companies and people who
want to have equity

11096
03:07:33,910 --> 03:07:33,920
want to have equity
 

11097
03:07:33,920 --> 03:07:35,510
want to have equity
but it will probably replace a big chunk

11098
03:07:35,510 --> 03:07:35,520
but it will probably replace a big chunk
 

11099
03:07:35,520 --> 03:07:37,190
but it will probably replace a big chunk
of current equity markets because right

11100
03:07:37,190 --> 03:07:37,200
of current equity markets because right
 

11101
03:07:37,200 --> 03:07:39,510
of current equity markets because right
now if you want to save it used to be

11102
03:07:39,510 --> 03:07:39,520
now if you want to save it used to be
 

11103
03:07:39,520 --> 03:07:40,870
now if you want to save it used to be
that you hold bonds now if you want to

11104
03:07:40,870 --> 03:07:40,880
that you hold bonds now if you want to
 

11105
03:07:40,880 --> 03:07:43,349
that you hold bonds now if you want to
save you go into stock indexes

11106
03:07:43,349 --> 03:07:43,359
save you go into stock indexes
 

11107
03:07:43,359 --> 03:07:45,750
save you go into stock indexes
so i think bitcoin likely eats a big

11108
03:07:45,750 --> 03:07:45,760
so i think bitcoin likely eats a big
 

11109
03:07:45,760 --> 03:07:47,510
so i think bitcoin likely eats a big
chunk of equity markets because

11110
03:07:47,510 --> 03:07:47,520
chunk of equity markets because
 

11111
03:07:47,520 --> 03:07:48,790
chunk of equity markets because
currently

11112
03:07:48,790 --> 03:07:48,800
currently
 

11113
03:07:48,800 --> 03:07:51,110
currently
it's people are using it as saving and i

11114
03:07:51,110 --> 03:07:51,120
it's people are using it as saving and i
 

11115
03:07:51,120 --> 03:07:52,870
it's people are using it as saving and i
think it eats all

11116
03:07:52,870 --> 03:07:52,880
think it eats all
 

11117
03:07:52,880 --> 03:07:55,510
think it eats all
bonds that's my most

11118
03:07:55,510 --> 03:07:55,520
bonds that's my most
 

11119
03:07:55,520 --> 03:07:58,150
bonds that's my most
ambitious well the question is the scale

11120
03:07:58,150 --> 03:07:58,160
ambitious well the question is the scale
 

11121
03:07:58,160 --> 03:08:00,870
ambitious well the question is the scale
of uh time that happens across but the

11122
03:08:00,870 --> 03:08:00,880
of uh time that happens across but the
 

11123
03:08:00,880 --> 03:08:02,150
of uh time that happens across but the
most important statement you're making

11124
03:08:02,150 --> 03:08:02,160
most important statement you're making
 

11125
03:08:02,160 --> 03:08:04,550
most important statement you're making
is about trend yeah and also i mean

11126
03:08:04,550 --> 03:08:04,560
is about trend yeah and also i mean
 

11127
03:08:04,560 --> 03:08:06,710
is about trend yeah and also i mean
let's also remember currently bonds

11128
03:08:06,710 --> 03:08:06,720
let's also remember currently bonds
 

11129
03:08:06,720 --> 03:08:09,030
let's also remember currently bonds
nominally don't beat inflation and in

11130
03:08:09,030 --> 03:08:09,040
nominally don't beat inflation and in
 

11131
03:08:09,040 --> 03:08:10,710
nominally don't beat inflation and in
real terms they

11132
03:08:10,710 --> 03:08:10,720
real terms they
 

11133
03:08:10,720 --> 03:08:14,230
real terms they
don't come close to beating inflation so

11134
03:08:14,230 --> 03:08:14,240
don't come close to beating inflation so
 

11135
03:08:14,240 --> 03:08:15,830
don't come close to beating inflation so
um currently you know with bonds you're

11136
03:08:15,830 --> 03:08:15,840
um currently you know with bonds you're
 

11137
03:08:15,840 --> 03:08:18,550
um currently you know with bonds you're
taking on credit default risk

11138
03:08:18,550 --> 03:08:18,560
taking on credit default risk
 

11139
03:08:18,560 --> 03:08:21,190
taking on credit default risk
to buy a bond and also

11140
03:08:21,190 --> 03:08:21,200
to buy a bond and also
 

11141
03:08:21,200 --> 03:08:23,510
to buy a bond and also
getting less money back in real terms

11142
03:08:23,510 --> 03:08:23,520
getting less money back in real terms
 

11143
03:08:23,520 --> 03:08:26,070
getting less money back in real terms
well bitcoin doesn't offer you returns

11144
03:08:26,070 --> 03:08:26,080
well bitcoin doesn't offer you returns
 

11145
03:08:26,080 --> 03:08:27,750
well bitcoin doesn't offer you returns
but in real terms it appreciates much

11146
03:08:27,750 --> 03:08:27,760
but in real terms it appreciates much
 

11147
03:08:27,760 --> 03:08:30,070
but in real terms it appreciates much
more and it has i believe a lot less

11148
03:08:30,070 --> 03:08:30,080
more and it has i believe a lot less
 

11149
03:08:30,080 --> 03:08:32,389
more and it has i believe a lot less
risk associated with it than any company

11150
03:08:32,389 --> 03:08:32,399
risk associated with it than any company
 

11151
03:08:32,399 --> 03:08:35,429
risk associated with it than any company
or government so let's make things spicy

11152
03:08:35,429 --> 03:08:35,439
or government so let's make things spicy
 

11153
03:08:35,439 --> 03:08:38,309
or government so let's make things spicy
and ask if if bitcoin fails in the long

11154
03:08:38,309 --> 03:08:38,319
and ask if if bitcoin fails in the long
 

11155
03:08:38,319 --> 03:08:40,150
and ask if if bitcoin fails in the long
term future

11156
03:08:40,150 --> 03:08:40,160
term future
 

11157
03:08:40,160 --> 03:08:42,230
term future
as all you just said economics

11158
03:08:42,230 --> 03:08:42,240
as all you just said economics
 

11159
03:08:42,240 --> 03:08:44,550
as all you just said economics
volatility things happen in this world

11160
03:08:44,550 --> 03:08:44,560
volatility things happen in this world
 

11161
03:08:44,560 --> 03:08:46,790
volatility things happen in this world
well the human civilization might end

11162
03:08:46,790 --> 03:08:46,800
well the human civilization might end
 

11163
03:08:46,800 --> 03:08:49,429
well the human civilization might end
in this century i hope it doesn't but it

11164
03:08:49,429 --> 03:08:49,439
in this century i hope it doesn't but it
 

11165
03:08:49,439 --> 03:08:51,990
in this century i hope it doesn't but it
might it could be catastrophic events

11166
03:08:51,990 --> 03:08:52,000
might it could be catastrophic events
 

11167
03:08:52,000 --> 03:08:54,230
might it could be catastrophic events
if bitcoin fails

11168
03:08:54,230 --> 03:08:54,240
if bitcoin fails
 

11169
03:08:54,240 --> 03:08:56,150
if bitcoin fails
it goes to zero loses its number one

11170
03:08:56,150 --> 03:08:56,160
it goes to zero loses its number one
 

11171
03:08:56,160 --> 03:08:57,429
it goes to zero loses its number one

what would be the reason if you're

11174
03:09:00,790 --> 03:09:00,800
what would be the reason if you're
 

11175
03:09:00,800 --> 03:09:03,429
what would be the reason if you're
an alien visiting earth 100 years from

an alien visiting earth 100 years from
now and just were to analyze the

03:09:05,110 --> 03:09:05,120
now and just were to analyze the
 

11179
03:09:05,120 --> 03:09:07,750

situation bitcoin is a pretty new thing

11180
03:09:07,750 --> 03:09:07,760
situation bitcoin is a pretty new thing
 

11181
03:09:07,760 --> 03:09:09,670
situation bitcoin is a pretty new thing
so the possible trajectories of how the

11182
03:09:09,670 --> 03:09:09,680
so the possible trajectories of how the
 

11183
03:09:09,680 --> 03:09:11,349
so the possible trajectories of how the
world evolves together with this new

11184
03:09:11,349 --> 03:09:11,359
world evolves together with this new
 

11185
03:09:11,359 --> 03:09:13,110
world evolves together with this new
monetary technology

11186
03:09:13,110 --> 03:09:13,120
monetary technology
 

11187
03:09:13,120 --> 03:09:16,309
monetary technology
is uh nearly infinite so if it fails one

11188
03:09:16,309 --> 03:09:16,319
is uh nearly infinite so if it fails one
 

11189
03:09:16,319 --> 03:09:18,230
is uh nearly infinite so if it fails one
of those trajectories surely involves

11190
03:09:18,230 --> 03:09:18,240
of those trajectories surely involves
 

11191
03:09:18,240 --> 03:09:21,190
of those trajectories surely involves
bitcoin failing what would be the reason

11192
03:09:21,190 --> 03:09:21,200
bitcoin failing what would be the reason
 

11193
03:09:21,200 --> 03:09:22,870
bitcoin failing what would be the reason
i think the most likely reason that it

11194
03:09:22,870 --> 03:09:22,880
i think the most likely reason that it
 

11195
03:09:22,880 --> 03:09:24,950
i think the most likely reason that it
could fail i don't think this is likely

11196
03:09:24,950 --> 03:09:24,960
could fail i don't think this is likely
 

11197
03:09:24,960 --> 03:09:26,790
could fail i don't think this is likely
in general but i think it is the most

11198
03:09:26,790 --> 03:09:26,800
in general but i think it is the most
 

11199
03:09:26,800 --> 03:09:28,550
in general but i think it is the most
likely of all the unlikely things that

11200
03:09:28,550 --> 03:09:28,560
likely of all the unlikely things that
 

11201
03:09:28,560 --> 03:09:30,469
likely of all the unlikely things that
could destroy bitcoin

11202
03:09:30,469 --> 03:09:30,479
could destroy bitcoin
 

11203
03:09:30,479 --> 03:09:32,550
could destroy bitcoin
is uh governments go back on a gold

11204
03:09:32,550 --> 03:09:32,560
is uh governments go back on a gold
 

11205
03:09:32,560 --> 03:09:34,150
is uh governments go back on a gold
standard

11206
03:09:34,150 --> 03:09:34,160
standard
 

11207
03:09:34,160 --> 03:09:37,269
standard
oh interesting so they make in your view

11208
03:09:37,269 --> 03:09:37,279
oh interesting so they make in your view
 

11209
03:09:37,279 --> 03:09:38,710
oh interesting so they make in your view
a better decision than the current

11210
03:09:38,710 --> 03:09:38,720
a better decision than the current
 

11211
03:09:38,720 --> 03:09:41,510
a better decision than the current
system just not the best decision

11212
03:09:41,510 --> 03:09:41,520
system just not the best decision
 

11213
03:09:41,520 --> 03:09:43,190
system just not the best decision
yeah and i thought you would go much

11214
03:09:43,190 --> 03:09:43,200
yeah and i thought you would go much
 

11215
03:09:43,200 --> 03:09:44,790
yeah and i thought you would go much
darker

11216
03:09:44,790 --> 03:09:44,800
darker
 

11217
03:09:44,800 --> 03:09:47,429
darker
but so that's yeah okay interesting so

11218
03:09:47,429 --> 03:09:47,439
but so that's yeah okay interesting so
 

11219
03:09:47,439 --> 03:09:49,349
but so that's yeah okay interesting so
maybe because of russia because of china

11220
03:09:49,349 --> 03:09:49,359
maybe because of russia because of china
 

11221
03:09:49,359 --> 03:09:51,990
maybe because of russia because of china
and so on because the current war

11222
03:09:51,990 --> 03:09:52,000
and so on because the current war
 

11223
03:09:52,000 --> 03:09:53,830
and so on because the current war
they might reconsider

11224
03:09:53,830 --> 03:09:53,840
they might reconsider
 

11225
03:09:53,840 --> 03:09:54,870
they might reconsider
the

11226
03:09:54,870 --> 03:09:54,880
the
 

11227
03:09:54,880 --> 03:09:57,750
the
the power that america holds because of

11228
03:09:57,750 --> 03:09:57,760
the power that america holds because of
 

11229
03:09:57,760 --> 03:09:59,110
the power that america holds because of
the monetary

11230
03:09:59,110 --> 03:09:59,120
the monetary
 

11231
03:09:59,120 --> 03:10:00,950
the monetary
because of being the primary currency

11232
03:10:00,950 --> 03:10:00,960
because of being the primary currency
 

11233
03:10:00,960 --> 03:10:03,910
because of being the primary currency
and they'll start thinking about going

11234
03:10:03,910 --> 03:10:03,920
and they'll start thinking about going
 

11235
03:10:03,920 --> 03:10:05,910
and they'll start thinking about going
on the gold standard yeah but it would

11236
03:10:05,910 --> 03:10:05,920
on the gold standard yeah but it would
 

11237
03:10:05,920 --> 03:10:07,990
on the gold standard yeah but it would
also require the us and the europeans

11238
03:10:07,990 --> 03:10:08,000
also require the us and the europeans
 

11239
03:10:08,000 --> 03:10:09,750
also require the us and the europeans
and everybody to want to join in this

11240

nice with each other around the gold

11244
03:10:13,830 --> 03:10:13,840
nice with each other around the gold
 

11245
03:10:13,840 --> 03:10:15,190
nice with each other around the gold
standard

11246
03:10:15,190 --> 03:10:15,200
standard
 

11247
03:10:15,200 --> 03:10:17,110
standard
i think you know given that gold already

11248
03:10:17,110 --> 03:10:17,120
i think you know given that gold already
 

11249
03:10:17,120 --> 03:10:19,590
i think you know given that gold already
is about 10 times larger than bitcoin so

11250
03:10:19,590 --> 03:10:19,600
is about 10 times larger than bitcoin so
 

11251
03:10:19,600 --> 03:10:21,830
is about 10 times larger than bitcoin so
it has a first mover advantage yes

11252
03:10:21,830 --> 03:10:21,840
it has a first mover advantage yes
 

11253
03:10:21,840 --> 03:10:23,269
it has a first mover advantage yes
um

11254
03:10:23,269 --> 03:10:23,279
um
 

11255
03:10:23,279 --> 03:10:25,030
um
if governments were to go and peg their

11256
03:10:25,030 --> 03:10:25,040
if governments were to go and peg their
 

11257
03:10:25,040 --> 03:10:26,710
if governments were to go and peg their
currencies to gold again the price of

11258
03:10:26,710 --> 03:10:26,720
currencies to gold again the price of
 

11259
03:10:26,720 --> 03:10:28,950
currencies to gold again the price of
gold would shoot up um

11260
03:10:28,950 --> 03:10:28,960
gold would shoot up um
 

11261
03:10:28,960 --> 03:10:30,630
gold would shoot up um
five 10x

11262
03:10:30,630 --> 03:10:30,640
five 10x
 

11263
03:10:30,640 --> 03:10:33,429
five 10x
and it would rise in value a lot more of

11264
03:10:33,429 --> 03:10:33,439
and it would rise in value a lot more of
 

11265
03:10:33,439 --> 03:10:34,790
and it would rise in value a lot more of
course that doesn't necessarily kill

11266
03:10:34,790 --> 03:10:34,800
course that doesn't necessarily kill
 

11267
03:10:34,800 --> 03:10:35,990
course that doesn't necessarily kill
bitcoin

11268
03:10:35,990 --> 03:10:36,000
bitcoin
 

11269
03:10:36,000 --> 03:10:37,349
bitcoin
no again i'm not saying it's likely to

11270
03:10:37,349 --> 03:10:37,359
no again i'm not saying it's likely to
 

11271
03:10:37,359 --> 03:10:39,030
no again i'm not saying it's likely to
happen i'm saying it's

11272
03:10:39,030 --> 03:10:39,040
happen i'm saying it's
 

11273
03:10:39,040 --> 03:10:41,429
happen i'm saying it's
i imagine less likely

11274
03:10:41,429 --> 03:10:41,439
i imagine less likely
 

11275
03:10:41,439 --> 03:10:43,349
i imagine less likely
less unlikely than all the other

11276
03:10:43,349 --> 03:10:43,359
less unlikely than all the other
 

11277
03:10:43,359 --> 03:10:45,110
less unlikely than all the other

03:23:56,389 --> 03:23:56,399
interesting yeah no i still stand by
 

12055
03:23:56,399 --> 03:23:58,309
interesting yeah no i still stand by
that um i think the uh would you

12056
03:23:58,309 --> 03:23:58,319
that um i think the uh would you
 

12057
03:23:58,319 --> 03:24:00,229
that um i think the uh would you
classify a theorem as a coin for

12058
03:24:00,229 --> 03:24:00,239
classify a theorem as a coin for
 

12059
03:24:00,239 --> 03:24:03,030
classify a theorem as a coin for
sure it's the um it's the mother

12060
03:24:03,030 --> 03:24:03,040
sure it's the um it's the mother
 

12061
03:24:03,040 --> 03:24:05,349

from which the coins spring

12062
03:24:05,349 --> 03:24:05,359
from which the coins spring

the royal the king bitcoin yeah

12064
03:24:07,910 --> 03:24:07,920
the royal the king bitcoin yeah
 

12065
03:24:07,920 --> 03:24:09,830
the royal the king bitcoin yeah
i think the key thing is uh you know the

12066
03:24:09,830 --> 03:24:09,840
i think the key thing is uh you know the
 

12067
03:24:09,840 --> 03:24:11,269
i think the key thing is uh you know the
way to think about there's another tweet

12068
03:24:11,269 --> 03:24:11,279
way to think about there's another tweet
 

12069
03:24:11,279 --> 03:24:13,190
way to think about there's another tweet
from a couple of years ago which is

12070
03:24:13,190 --> 03:24:13,200
from a couple of years ago which is
 

12071
03:24:13,200 --> 03:24:15,190
from a couple of years ago which is
essentially proof of work was like the

12072
03:24:15,190 --> 03:24:15,200
essentially proof of work was like the
 

12073
03:24:15,200 --> 03:24:16,790
essentially proof of work was like the
invention of flight like we've got in

12074
03:24:16,790 --> 03:24:16,800
invention of flight like we've got in
 

12075
03:24:16,800 --> 03:24:18,229
invention of flight like we've got in
this machine and we managed to get it to

this machine and we managed to get it to
 

12077
03:24:18,239 --> 03:24:21,429
this machine and we managed to get it to
fly off the ground and proof of stake is

12078
03:24:21,429 --> 03:24:21,439
fly off the ground and proof of stake is
 

12079
03:24:21,439 --> 03:24:23,590
fly off the ground and proof of stake is
hey we found a great way to make

right so and the basic criticism is that

want to elaborate more on this there's a
 

12191
03:26:16,720 --> 03:26:18,150
want to elaborate more on this there's a
bunch of people in charge which means

12192
03:26:18,150 --> 03:26:18,160
bunch of people in charge which means
 

12193
03:26:18,160 --> 03:26:18,870
bunch of people in charge which means
that

that
 

12195
03:26:18,880 --> 03:26:21,030
that
um you know legally they should be doing

12196
03:26:21,030 --> 03:26:21,040
um you know legally they should be doing
 

12197
03:26:21,040 --> 03:26:23,750
um you know legally they should be doing
this under securities law um but even as

12198
03:26:23,750 --> 03:26:23,760
this under securities law um but even as
 

12199
03:26:23,760 --> 03:26:25,349
this under securities law um but even as
an anarchist if i don't want to care

about that
 

12203
03:26:26,560 --> 03:26:28,790
about that
the technical implication of it is this

12204
03:26:28,790 --> 03:26:28,800
the technical implication of it is this
 

12205
03:26:28,800 --> 03:26:30,389
the technical implication of it is this
is never going to be adopted as a

03:29:19,760 --> 03:29:22,309
breaking out of all these hallucinations
it's very hard to introspect

12370
03:29:22,309 --> 03:29:22,319
it's very hard to introspect
 

12371
03:29:22,319 --> 03:29:23,750
it's very hard to introspect
thinking like what are the assumptions

12372
03:29:23,750 --> 03:29:23,760
thinking like what are the assumptions
 

12373
03:29:23,760 --> 03:29:25,910
thinking like what are the assumptions
under which i lived my entire life that

under which i lived my entire life that
might be actually false assumptions

12376
03:29:27,670 --> 03:29:27,680
might be actually false assumptions
 

12377
03:29:27,680 --> 03:29:29,030
might be actually false assumptions
that's a really

12378
03:29:29,030 --> 03:29:29,040
that's a really
 

12379
03:29:29,040 --> 03:29:30,950
that's a really
difficult uh thought process to take

12380
03:29:30,950 --> 03:29:30,960
difficult uh thought process to take
 

12381
03:29:30,960 --> 03:29:33,030
difficult uh thought process to take
it's a dangerous one it's you the

12382
03:29:33,030 --> 03:29:33,040
it's a dangerous one it's you the
 

12383

it begins to really destroy him so it's
 

12401
03:29:49,120 --> 03:29:51,269
it begins to really destroy him so it's
a psychological burden to to carry so if

12402
03:29:51,269 --> 03:29:51,279
a psychological burden to to carry so if
 

12403
03:29:51,279 --> 03:29:52,309
a psychological burden to to carry so if
you question

12404
03:29:52,309 --> 03:29:52,319
you question
 

12405
03:29:52,319 --> 03:29:53,510
you question
if you question authority if you

12406
03:29:53,510 --> 03:29:53,520
if you question authority if you
 

12407

12411
03:29:57,040 --> 03:29:58,950
culture the way things have been done
it's really difficult

12412
03:29:58,950 --> 03:29:58,960
it's really difficult
 

12413
03:29:58,960 --> 03:30:02,229
it's really difficult
um and the biases you are operate under

12414
03:30:02,229 --> 03:30:02,239
um and the biases you are operate under
 

12415
03:30:02,239 --> 03:30:03,590
um and the biases you are operate under
it's really difficult to question them

up with conclusions and you delete spam

i'll just say from my
 

12469
03:30:53,920 --> 03:30:56,870
i'll just say from my
relatively sort of shallow perspective

12470
03:30:56,870 --> 03:30:56,880
relatively sort of shallow perspective
 

12471
03:30:56,880 --> 03:30:59,510
relatively sort of shallow perspective
almost like a technical person mostly my

12472
03:30:59,510 --> 03:30:59,520
almost like a technical person mostly my

understanding of economics is weak

12474
03:31:01,670 --> 03:31:01,680
understanding of economics is weak
 

12475
03:31:01,680 --> 03:31:07,510
understanding of economics is weak
um proof of stake is not obviously

12476
03:31:07,510 --> 03:31:07,520

 

12477
03:31:07,520 --> 03:31:09,990

a weak consensus mechanism relative to

12478
03:31:09,990 --> 03:31:10,000
a weak consensus mechanism relative to
 

12479
03:31:10,000 --> 03:31:12,070
a weak consensus mechanism relative to
proof of work

12480
03:31:12,070 --> 03:31:12,080
proof of work
 

12481
03:31:12,080 --> 03:31:13,750
proof of work
so it's not that's not obvious to me

12482
03:31:13,750 --> 03:31:13,760
so it's not that's not obvious to me
 

12483
03:31:13,760 --> 03:31:15,349
so it's not that's not obvious to me
that that goes wrong and get becomes

12484
03:31:15,349 --> 03:31:15,359
that that goes wrong and get becomes
 

12485
03:31:15,359 --> 03:31:17,429
that that goes wrong and get becomes
corrupted in the way that governments

12486
03:31:17,429 --> 03:31:17,439
corrupted in the way that governments
 

12487
03:31:17,439 --> 03:31:20,070
corrupted in the way that governments
get corrupted because it still

12488
03:31:20,070 --> 03:31:20,080
get corrupted because it still
 

12489
03:31:20,080 --> 03:31:22,550
get corrupted because it still
seems decentralized now your criticism

12490
03:31:22,550 --> 03:31:22,560
seems decentralized now your criticism
 

12491
03:31:22,560 --> 03:31:24,790
seems decentralized now your criticism
of governance is an interesting one but

12492
03:31:24,790 --> 03:31:24,800
of governance is an interesting one but
 

12493
03:31:24,800 --> 03:31:26,550
of governance is an interesting one but
if you put that aside

12494
03:31:26,550 --> 03:31:26,560
if you put that aside
 

12495
03:31:26,560 --> 03:31:29,190
if you put that aside
it still is a decentralized mechanism

12496
03:31:29,190 --> 03:31:29,200
it still is a decentralized mechanism
 

12497
03:31:29,200 --> 03:31:31,349
it still is a decentralized mechanism
and it's more transparent than the

12498
03:31:31,349 --> 03:31:31,359
and it's more transparent than the
 

12499
03:31:31,359 --> 03:31:32,550
and it's more transparent than the
mechanism

12500
03:31:32,550 --> 03:31:32,560
mechanism
 

12501
03:31:32,560 --> 03:31:34,150
mechanism
that governments operate it isn't it's

12502
03:31:34,150 --> 03:31:34,160
that governments operate it isn't it's
 

12503
03:31:34,160 --> 03:31:35,750
that governments operate it isn't it's
exactly what the federal reserve is the

12504
03:31:35,750 --> 03:31:35,760
exactly what the federal reserve is the
 

12505
03:31:35,760 --> 03:31:37,190
exactly what the federal reserve is the
federal reserve is a proof of stake

12506
03:31:37,190 --> 03:31:37,200
federal reserve is a proof of stake
 

12507
03:31:37,200 --> 03:31:39,110
federal reserve is a proof of stake
system the federal reserve is owned by

12508
03:31:39,110 --> 03:31:39,120
system the federal reserve is owned by
 

12509
03:31:39,120 --> 03:31:41,510
system the federal reserve is owned by
its constituent banks and so the rules

12510
03:31:41,510 --> 03:31:41,520
its constituent banks and so the rules
 

12511
03:31:41,520 --> 03:31:42,469
its constituent banks and so the rules
of the federal reserve and the

12512
03:31:42,469 --> 03:31:42,479
of the federal reserve and the
 

12513
03:31:42,479 --> 03:31:44,070
of the federal reserve and the
regulations are determined by the

12514
03:31:44,070 --> 03:31:44,080
regulations are determined by the
 

12515
03:31:44,080 --> 03:31:45,990
regulations are determined by the
ownership which is the banks so it's

12516
03:31:45,990 --> 03:31:46,000
ownership which is the banks so it's
 

12517
03:31:46,000 --> 03:31:47,830
ownership which is the banks so it's
exactly what the federal reserve is but

12518
03:31:47,830 --> 03:31:47,840
exactly what the federal reserve is but
 

12519
03:31:47,840 --> 03:31:50,389
exactly what the federal reserve is but
it's too back door the the agreements

12520
03:31:50,389 --> 03:31:50,399
it's too back door the the agreements
 

12521
03:31:50,399 --> 03:31:52,630
it's too back door the the agreements
between the the banks and the federal

12522
03:31:52,630 --> 03:31:52,640
between the the banks and the federal
 

12523
03:31:52,640 --> 03:31:54,550
between the the banks and the federal
reserve it feels like a lot of those

12524
03:31:54,550 --> 03:31:54,560
reserve it feels like a lot of those
 

12525
03:31:54,560 --> 03:31:56,790
reserve it feels like a lot of those
agreements are made between individuals

12526
03:31:56,790 --> 03:31:56,800
agreements are made between individuals
 

12527
03:31:56,800 --> 03:31:57,510
agreements are made between individuals
that

12528
03:31:57,510 --> 03:31:57,520
that
 

12529
03:31:57,520 --> 03:31:59,590
that
sort of behind the scenes it's not hard

12530
03:31:59,590 --> 03:31:59,600
sort of behind the scenes it's not hard
 

12531
03:31:59,600 --> 03:32:02,550
sort of behind the scenes it's not hard
to it's opaque yes but the only way that

12532
03:32:02,550 --> 03:32:02,560
to it's opaque yes but the only way that
 

12533
03:32:02,560 --> 03:32:04,469
to it's opaque yes but the only way that
a proof of stake system will take off is

12534
03:32:04,469 --> 03:32:04,479
a proof of stake system will take off is
 

12535
03:32:04,479 --> 03:32:06,070
a proof of stake system will take off is
if you have a military to force people

12536
03:32:06,070 --> 03:32:06,080
if you have a military to force people
 

12537
03:32:06,080 --> 03:32:07,110
if you have a military to force people
to use it

12538
03:32:07,110 --> 03:32:07,120
to use it
 

12539
03:32:07,120 --> 03:32:08,870
to use it
that's the thing ultimately there's no

12540
03:32:08,870 --> 03:32:08,880
that's the thing ultimately there's no
 

12541
03:32:08,880 --> 03:32:11,190
that's the thing ultimately there's no
way that it's going to take off on on a

03:32:11,190 --> 03:32:11,200
way that it's going to take off on on a
 

12543
03:32:11,200 --> 03:32:12,630
way that it's going to take off on on a
free market and that's why

12544
03:32:12,630 --> 03:32:12,640
free market and that's why
 

12545
03:32:12,640 --> 03:32:14,150
free market and that's why
you know for all of the bluster about

12546
03:32:14,150 --> 03:32:14,160
you know for all of the bluster about
 

12547
03:32:14,160 --> 03:32:15,750
you know for all of the bluster about
wanting to move to a proof-of-stake

12548
03:32:15,750 --> 03:32:15,760
wanting to move to a proof-of-stake

12553
03:32:20,560 --> 03:32:22,469
since 2014 it's now been eight years you
know they've been talking about it

12554
03:32:22,469 --> 03:32:22,479
know they've been talking about it
 

12555
03:32:22,479 --> 03:32:24,710
know they've been talking about it
they we still haven't seen the proof of

they we still haven't seen the proof of

potential i mean you can do it in a

03:32:32,630 --> 03:32:32,640
potential i mean you can do it in a
 

12565
03:32:32,640 --> 03:32:34,550
potential i mean you can do it in a
centralized way but like

12566
03:32:34,550 --> 03:32:34,560
centralized way but like
 

12567
03:32:34,560 --> 03:32:35,750
centralized way but like
um

12568
03:32:35,750 --> 03:32:35,760
um
 

12569
03:32:35,760 --> 03:32:37,830
um
can it survive can it last for a long

12570
03:32:37,830 --> 03:32:37,840
can it survive can it last for a long

i don't think so and i think um you know

12574
03:32:41,269 --> 03:32:41,279
i don't think so and i think um you know
 

12575
03:32:41,279 --> 03:32:43,670
i don't think so and i think um you know
it it can last perhaps initially with

it it can last perhaps initially with

it it can last perhaps initially with

marketing with centralized marketing you
 

12579
03:32:45,359 --> 03:32:47,510
marketing with centralized marketing you
can promote it but

12580
03:32:47,510 --> 03:32:47,520
can promote it but
 

12581
03:32:47,520 --> 03:32:49,510
can promote it but
ultimately

interested in speculating because they

12586
03:32:53,510 --> 03:32:53,520
interested in speculating because they
 

12587
03:32:53,520 --> 03:32:54,710
interested in speculating because they
want to get rich on this the people that

12588

want to get rich on this the people that
 

12589
03:32:54,720 --> 03:32:56,070
want to get rich on this the people that
are going to use it they're going to

03:32:56,070 --> 03:32:56,080
are going to use it they're going to
 

12591
03:32:56,080 --> 03:32:57,830
are going to use it they're going to
want to use it because they can

12592
03:32:57,830 --> 03:32:57,840
want to use it because they can
 

12593
03:32:57,840 --> 03:33:00,229
want to use it because they can
trust that it is not going to be messed

12594
03:33:00,229 --> 03:33:00,239
trust that it is not going to be messed
 

12595
03:33:00,239 --> 03:33:02,550
trust that it is not going to be messed
with yes so like but there's also

12596
03:33:02,550 --> 03:33:02,560
with yes so like but there's also
 

12597
03:33:02,560 --> 03:33:04,070
with yes so like but there's also
applications that i was a lot lightening

12598
03:33:04,070 --> 03:33:04,080
applications that i was a lot lightening
 

12599
03:33:04,080 --> 03:33:05,990
applications that i was a lot lightening
network but there's applications on top

12600
03:33:05,990 --> 03:33:06,000
network but there's applications on top
 

12601
03:33:06,000 --> 03:33:08,309
network but there's applications on top
like well the reason i'm interested in

12602
03:33:08,309 --> 03:33:08,319
like well the reason i'm interested in
 

12603
03:33:08,319 --> 03:33:10,710
like well the reason i'm interested in
things like ethereum is you might think

12604
03:33:10,710 --> 03:33:10,720
things like ethereum is you might think
 

12605
03:33:10,720 --> 03:33:12,309
things like ethereum is you might think
it's ridiculous i thought it was

12606
03:33:12,309 --> 03:33:12,319
it's ridiculous i thought it was
 

12607
03:33:12,319 --> 03:33:14,309
it's ridiculous i thought it was
ridiculous but nfts

12608
03:33:14,309 --> 03:33:14,319
ridiculous but nfts
 

12609
03:33:14,319 --> 03:33:16,389
ridiculous but nfts
right so what's the you can have nfts

12610
03:33:16,389 --> 03:33:16,399
right so what's the you can have nfts
 

12611
03:33:16,399 --> 03:33:18,550
right so what's the you can have nfts
probably on top of bitcoin but you don't

12612
03:33:18,550 --> 03:33:18,560
probably on top of bitcoin but you don't
 

12613
03:33:18,560 --> 03:33:19,990
probably on top of bitcoin but you don't
because there's no marketing on in

12614
03:33:19,990 --> 03:33:20,000
because there's no marketing on in
 

12615
03:33:20,000 --> 03:33:21,510
because there's no marketing on in
bitcoin because

12616
03:33:21,510 --> 03:33:21,520
bitcoin because
 

12617
03:33:21,520 --> 03:33:23,030
bitcoin because
all of these ideas get promoted on

12618
03:33:23,030 --> 03:33:23,040
all of these ideas get promoted on
 

12619
03:33:23,040 --> 03:33:25,510
all of these ideas get promoted on
proprietary coins because yes but

12620
03:33:25,510 --> 03:33:25,520
proprietary coins because yes but
 

12621
03:33:25,520 --> 03:33:27,750
proprietary coins because yes but
there's the network effects of ideas of

12622
03:33:27,750 --> 03:33:27,760
there's the network effects of ideas of
 

12623
03:33:27,760 --> 03:33:29,910
there's the network effects of ideas of
applications so they just take off for

12624
03:33:29,910 --> 03:33:29,920
applications so they just take off for
 

12625
03:33:29,920 --> 03:33:32,070
applications so they just take off for
some reason and human civilization is

12626
03:33:32,070 --> 03:33:32,080
some reason and human civilization is
 

12627
03:33:32,080 --> 03:33:33,750
some reason and human civilization is
such that you get excited about stuff

12628
03:33:33,750 --> 03:33:33,760
such that you get excited about stuff
 

12629
03:33:33,760 --> 03:33:35,190
such that you get excited about stuff
and large amounts of people believe a

12630
03:33:35,190 --> 03:33:35,200
and large amounts of people believe a
 

12631
03:33:35,200 --> 03:33:37,269
and large amounts of people believe a
thing and they start to get excited it

12632
03:33:37,269 --> 03:33:37,279
thing and they start to get excited it
 

12633
03:33:37,279 --> 03:33:39,110
thing and they start to get excited it
actually has impact like the fact that

12634
03:33:39,110 --> 03:33:39,120
actually has impact like the fact that
 

12635
03:33:39,120 --> 03:33:41,429
actually has impact like the fact that
nfts can have an impact on the art world

12636
03:33:41,429 --> 03:33:41,439
nfts can have an impact on the art world
 

12637
03:33:41,439 --> 03:33:43,110
nfts can have an impact on the art world
or the world in general

12638
03:33:43,110 --> 03:33:43,120
or the world in general
 

12639
03:33:43,120 --> 03:33:45,269
or the world in general
is is wild to me

12640
03:33:45,269 --> 03:33:45,279
is is wild to me
 

12641
03:33:45,279 --> 03:33:47,110
is is wild to me
but it it worked so well you know the

12642
03:33:47,110 --> 03:33:47,120
but it it worked so well you know the
 

12643
03:33:47,120 --> 03:33:49,429
but it it worked so well you know the
question is david rothko has an impact

12644
03:33:49,429 --> 03:33:49,439
question is david rothko has an impact
 

12645
03:33:49,439 --> 03:33:52,070
question is david rothko has an impact
on the art world doesn't say much i'm

12646
03:33:52,070 --> 03:33:52,080
on the art world doesn't say much i'm
 

12647
03:33:52,080 --> 03:33:54,710
on the art world doesn't say much i'm
saying these ideas have you know we're

12648
03:33:54,710 --> 03:33:54,720
saying these ideas have you know we're
 

12649
03:33:54,720 --> 03:33:56,710
saying these ideas have you know we're
collective intelligent beings and we can

12650
03:33:56,710 --> 03:33:56,720
collective intelligent beings and we can
 

12651
03:33:56,720 --> 03:33:58,389
collective intelligent beings and we can
believe a thing and that has

12652
03:33:58,389 --> 03:33:58,399
believe a thing and that has
 

12653
03:33:58,399 --> 03:34:01,190
believe a thing and that has
that has power that has led to major

12654
03:34:01,190 --> 03:34:01,200
that has power that has led to major
 

12655
03:34:01,200 --> 03:34:02,950
that has power that has led to major
wars and all those kinds of things so

12656
03:34:02,950 --> 03:34:02,960
wars and all those kinds of things so
 

12657
03:34:02,960 --> 03:34:04,070
wars and all those kinds of things so
the

12658
03:34:04,070 --> 03:34:04,080
the
 

12659
03:34:04,080 --> 03:34:06,870
the
uh it's interesting to me that nfts took

12660
03:34:06,870 --> 03:34:06,880
uh it's interesting to me that nfts took
 

12661
03:34:06,880 --> 03:34:08,309
uh it's interesting to me that nfts took
hold and the question is is there

12662
03:34:08,309 --> 03:34:08,319
hold and the question is is there
 

12663
03:34:08,319 --> 03:34:09,990
hold and the question is is there
distributed you know dabs is there's

12664
03:34:09,990 --> 03:34:10,000
distributed you know dabs is there's
 

12665
03:34:10,000 --> 03:34:11,429
distributed you know dabs is there's
distributed apps built on top of

12666
03:34:11,429 --> 03:34:11,439
distributed apps built on top of
 

12667
03:34:11,439 --> 03:34:13,830
distributed apps built on top of
different blockchains that might somehow

12668
03:34:13,830 --> 03:34:13,840
different blockchains that might somehow
 

12669
03:34:13,840 --> 03:34:15,429
different blockchains that might somehow
transform the world you have to kind of

12670
03:34:15,429 --> 03:34:15,439
transform the world you have to kind of
 

12671
03:34:15,439 --> 03:34:17,269
transform the world you have to kind of
keep an open mind to that

12672
03:34:17,269 --> 03:34:17,279
keep an open mind to that
 

12673
03:34:17,279 --> 03:34:19,429
keep an open mind to that
uh because right now it's like uh it's

12674
03:34:19,429 --> 03:34:19,439
uh because right now it's like uh it's
 

12675
03:34:19,439 --> 03:34:21,349
uh because right now it's like uh it's
like i'm the same place with that as i

12676
03:34:21,349 --> 03:34:21,359
like i'm the same place with that as i
 

12677
03:34:21,359 --> 03:34:23,510
like i'm the same place with that as i
am with like virtual reality it's like

am with like virtual reality it's like
 

12679
03:34:23,520 --> 03:34:24,950
am with like virtual reality it's like
all right

12680
03:34:24,950 --> 03:34:24,960
all right
 

12681
03:34:24,960 --> 03:34:27,269
all right
this seems like a really intellectually

12682
03:34:27,269 --> 03:34:27,279
this seems like a really intellectually

set of ideas here but there's something

12686
03:34:30,469 --> 03:34:30,479
set of ideas here but there's something
 

12687
03:34:30,479 --> 03:34:32,870
set of ideas here but there's something
either technically or socially not quite

12688
03:34:32,870 --> 03:34:32,880
either technically or socially not quite
 

12689
03:34:32,880 --> 03:34:35,349
either technically or socially not quite
taking hold why

12690
03:34:35,349 --> 03:34:35,359
taking hold why
 

12691
03:34:35,359 --> 03:34:36,950
taking hold why
and i don't know what the right answer

12692
03:34:36,950 --> 03:34:36,960
and i don't know what the right answer
 

12693
03:34:36,960 --> 03:34:38,790
and i don't know what the right answer
is so with virtual reality what's the

12694
03:34:38,790 --> 03:34:38,800
is so with virtual reality what's the
 

12695
03:34:38,800 --> 03:34:41,429
is so with virtual reality what's the
right answer is it just technically

12696
03:34:41,429 --> 03:34:41,439
right answer is it just technically
 

12697
03:34:41,439 --> 03:34:44,950
right answer is it just technically
the latency is too high or

12698
03:34:44,950 --> 03:34:44,960
the latency is too high or
 

12699
03:34:44,960 --> 03:34:47,110
the latency is too high or
the games are not good enough or is it a

12700
03:34:47,110 --> 03:34:47,120
the games are not good enough or is it a
 

12701
03:34:47,120 --> 03:34:48,790
the games are not good enough or is it a
fundamentally flawed idea that you can

12702
03:34:48,790 --> 03:34:48,800
fundamentally flawed idea that you can
 

12703
03:34:48,800 --> 03:34:51,110
fundamentally flawed idea that you can
live in a virtual world and enjoy it

03:39:43,269 --> 03:39:43,279
developments and the scale at which
 

12985
03:39:43,279 --> 03:39:45,189
developments and the scale at which
those developments might actually have a

12986
03:39:45,189 --> 03:39:45,199
those developments might actually have a
 

12987
03:39:45,199 --> 03:39:47,830
those developments might actually have a
transformative impact the time scale is

12988
03:39:47,830 --> 03:39:47,840
transformative impact the time scale is
 

12989
03:39:47,840 --> 03:39:50,389
transformative impact the time scale is
unclear it seems like we all

12990
03:39:50,389 --> 03:39:50,399
unclear it seems like we all
 

12991
03:39:50,399 --> 03:39:52,870
unclear it seems like we all
certainly over promise we dream too big

12992
03:39:52,870 --> 03:39:52,880
certainly over promise we dream too big
 

12993
03:39:52,880 --> 03:39:55,269
certainly over promise we dream too big
and too aggressively in the ai community

12994
03:39:55,269 --> 03:39:55,279
and too aggressively in the ai community
 

12995
03:39:55,279 --> 03:39:57,030
and too aggressively in the ai community
but a lot of yeah and i'm happy to give

12996
03:39:57,030 --> 03:39:57,040
but a lot of yeah and i'm happy to give
 

12997
03:39:57,040 --> 03:39:58,469
but a lot of yeah and i'm happy to give
people the benefit of the doubt when

12998
03:39:58,469 --> 03:39:58,479
people the benefit of the doubt when
 

12999
03:39:58,479 --> 03:40:00,229
people the benefit of the doubt when
they're over promising but not when

13000
03:40:00,229 --> 03:40:00,239
they're over promising but not when
 

13001
03:40:00,239 --> 03:40:01,910
they're over promising but not when
they're making their own money when you

13002
03:40:01,910 --> 03:40:01,920
they're making their own money when you
 

13003
03:40:01,920 --> 03:40:04,309
they're making their own money when you
start making your own currency then you

13004
03:40:04,309 --> 03:40:04,319
start making your own currency then you
 

13005
03:40:04,319 --> 03:40:05,590
start making your own currency then you
don't get the benefit of the doubt

13006
03:40:05,590 --> 03:40:05,600
don't get the benefit of the doubt
 

13007
03:40:05,600 --> 03:40:07,670
don't get the benefit of the doubt
because if your idea needs you to have a

13008
03:40:07,670 --> 03:40:07,680
because if your idea needs you to have a
 

13009
03:40:07,680 --> 03:40:09,510
because if your idea needs you to have a
new currency that you print when bitcoin

13010
03:40:09,510 --> 03:40:09,520
new currency that you print when bitcoin
 

13011
03:40:09,520 --> 03:40:10,550
new currency that you print when bitcoin
is out there

is out there
 

13013
03:40:10,560 --> 03:40:12,550
is out there
then i'm gonna go ahead and assume that

interesting to you that they're even

13040

interesting to you that they're even
 

13041
03:40:45,600 --> 03:40:47,510
interesting to you that they're even
considering this kind of thing i used to

13042
03:40:47,510 --> 03:40:47,520
considering this kind of thing i used to
 

13043
03:40:47,520 --> 03:40:50,229
considering this kind of thing i used to
think that it's um it's just basically

13044
03:40:50,229 --> 03:40:50,239
think that it's um it's just basically
 

13045
03:40:50,239 --> 03:40:51,110
think that it's um it's just basically
um

13046
03:40:51,110 --> 03:40:51,120
um
 

13047

um
waffle it's meaningless

13048
03:40:53,349 --> 03:40:53,359
waffle it's meaningless
 

13049
03:40:53,359 --> 03:40:54,150
waffle it's meaningless
because

13050
03:40:54,150 --> 03:40:54,160
because
 

13051
03:40:54,160 --> 03:40:55,990
because
as it exists the dollar is a central

13052
03:40:55,990 --> 03:40:56,000
as it exists the dollar is a central
 

13053
03:40:56,000 --> 03:40:57,670
as it exists the dollar is a central
bank digital currency right the vast

13054
03:40:57,670 --> 03:40:57,680
bank digital currency right the vast
 

13055
03:40:57,680 --> 03:41:00,950
bank digital currency right the vast
majority of dollars are digital and um

13056
03:41:00,950 --> 03:41:00,960
majority of dollars are digital and um
 

13057
03:41:00,960 --> 03:41:02,710
majority of dollars are digital and um
but i think the way that over the last

13058
03:41:02,710 --> 03:41:02,720
but i think the way that over the last
 

13059
03:41:02,720 --> 03:41:03,990
but i think the way that over the last
couple of years i've changed my mind on

13060
03:41:03,990 --> 03:41:04,000
couple of years i've changed my mind on
 

13061
03:41:04,000 --> 03:41:05,510
couple of years i've changed my mind on
this i think this is that there's some

13062
03:41:05,510 --> 03:41:05,520
this i think this is that there's some
 

13063
03:41:05,520 --> 03:41:08,309
this i think this is that there's some
serious substance behind these ideas

13064
03:41:08,309 --> 03:41:08,319
serious substance behind these ideas
 

13065
03:41:08,319 --> 03:41:11,510
serious substance behind these ideas
and what they mean effectively is the

13066
03:41:11,510 --> 03:41:11,520
and what they mean effectively is the
 

13067
03:41:11,520 --> 03:41:13,990
and what they mean effectively is the
disintermediation of the banking system

13068
03:41:13,990 --> 03:41:14,000
disintermediation of the banking system
 

13069
03:41:14,000 --> 03:41:15,990
disintermediation of the banking system
and giving everybody an account at the

13070
03:41:15,990 --> 03:41:16,000
and giving everybody an account at the
 

13071
03:41:16,000 --> 03:41:18,070
and giving everybody an account at the
federal reserve this is

13072
03:41:18,070 --> 03:41:18,080
federal reserve this is
 

13073
03:41:18,080 --> 03:41:20,790
federal reserve this is
this is kind of the really dangerous uh

13074
03:41:20,790 --> 03:41:20,800
this is kind of the really dangerous uh
 

13075
03:41:20,800 --> 03:41:22,309
this is kind of the really dangerous uh
idea and i think this is enormously

13076
03:41:22,309 --> 03:41:22,319
idea and i think this is enormously
 

13077
03:41:22,319 --> 03:41:23,990
idea and i think this is enormously
significant effectively

13078
03:41:23,990 --> 03:41:24,000
significant effectively
 

13079
03:41:24,000 --> 03:41:25,510
significant effectively
as somebody who's lived in the soviet

13080
03:41:25,510 --> 03:41:25,520
as somebody who's lived in the soviet
 

13081
03:41:25,520 --> 03:41:27,030
as somebody who's lived in the soviet
union what this is is the return of the

13082
03:41:27,030 --> 03:41:27,040
union what this is is the return of the
 

13083
03:41:27,040 --> 03:41:29,750
union what this is is the return of the
ghost bank on a global scale with modern

13084
03:41:29,750 --> 03:41:29,760
ghost bank on a global scale with modern
 

13085
03:41:29,760 --> 03:41:31,750
ghost bank on a global scale with modern
technology so under the soviet union

13086
03:41:31,750 --> 03:41:31,760
technology so under the soviet union
 

13087
03:41:31,760 --> 03:41:33,429
technology so under the soviet union
there was something called the goss bank

13088
03:41:33,429 --> 03:41:33,439
there was something called the goss bank
 

13089
03:41:33,439 --> 03:41:35,349
there was something called the goss bank
or people's bank and that was the only

13090
03:41:35,349 --> 03:41:35,359
or people's bank and that was the only
 

13091
03:41:35,359 --> 03:41:36,950
or people's bank and that was the only
bank in the country and you had an

13092
03:41:36,950 --> 03:41:36,960
bank in the country and you had an
 

13093
03:41:36,960 --> 03:41:39,429
bank in the country and you had an
account with the national bank

13094
03:41:39,429 --> 03:41:39,439
account with the national bank
 

13095
03:41:39,439 --> 03:41:41,590
account with the national bank
and you know if you

13096
03:41:41,590 --> 03:41:41,600
and you know if you
 

13097
03:41:41,600 --> 03:41:43,910
and you know if you
said something wrong your money got

13098
03:41:43,910 --> 03:41:43,920
said something wrong your money got
 

13099
03:41:43,920 --> 03:41:46,070
said something wrong your money got
terminated from the goss bank now

13100
03:41:46,070 --> 03:41:46,080
terminated from the goss bank now
 

13101
03:41:46,080 --> 03:41:48,469
terminated from the goss bank now
imagine that combined with the power of

13102
03:41:48,469 --> 03:41:48,479
imagine that combined with the power of
 

13103
03:41:48,479 --> 03:41:50,389
imagine that combined with the power of
digital technology

13104
03:41:50,389 --> 03:41:50,399
digital technology
 

13105
03:41:50,399 --> 03:41:52,070
digital technology
and you can see that this could

13106
03:41:52,070 --> 03:41:52,080
and you can see that this could
 

13107
03:41:52,080 --> 03:41:55,189
and you can see that this could
be an enormously powerful um

13108
03:41:55,189 --> 03:41:55,199
be an enormously powerful um
 

13109
03:41:55,199 --> 03:41:56,950
be an enormously powerful um
technology really because

13110
03:41:56,950 --> 03:41:56,960
technology really because
 

13111
03:41:56,960 --> 03:41:59,349
technology really because
if banks are out of the picture then we

13112
03:41:59,349 --> 03:41:59,359
if banks are out of the picture then we
 

13113
03:41:59,359 --> 03:42:03,110
if banks are out of the picture then we
change the fundamental reality of fiat

13114
03:42:03,110 --> 03:42:03,120
change the fundamental reality of fiat
 

13115
03:42:03,120 --> 03:42:04,790
change the fundamental reality of fiat
as being the creation of money through

13116
03:42:04,790 --> 03:42:04,800
as being the creation of money through
 

13117
03:42:04,800 --> 03:42:06,950
as being the creation of money through
lending and then it becomes the creation

13118
03:42:06,950 --> 03:42:06,960
lending and then it becomes the creation
 

13119
03:42:06,960 --> 03:42:09,269
lending and then it becomes the creation
of money truly by fiat by government

13120
03:42:09,269 --> 03:42:09,279
of money truly by fiat by government
 

13121
03:42:09,279 --> 03:42:11,429
of money truly by fiat by government
fiat so we move to a system in which

13122
03:42:11,429 --> 03:42:11,439
fiat so we move to a system in which
 

13123
03:42:11,439 --> 03:42:14,070
fiat so we move to a system in which
money is just basically

13124
03:42:14,070 --> 03:42:14,080
money is just basically
 

13125
03:42:14,080 --> 03:42:15,830
money is just basically
it's it's like we have money that is

13126
03:42:15,830 --> 03:42:15,840
it's it's like we have money that is
 

13127
03:42:15,840 --> 03:42:17,269
it's it's like we have money that is
pieces of paper and every time we've had

13128
03:42:17,269 --> 03:42:17,279
pieces of paper and every time we've had
 

13129
03:42:17,279 --> 03:42:19,590
pieces of paper and every time we've had
money we've had fiat money that was just

13130
03:42:19,590 --> 03:42:19,600
money we've had fiat money that was just
 

13131
03:42:19,600 --> 03:42:21,269
money we've had fiat money that was just
pieces of paper it collapsed very

13132
03:42:21,269 --> 03:42:21,279
pieces of paper it collapsed very
 

13133
03:42:21,279 --> 03:42:22,870
pieces of paper it collapsed very
quickly

13134
03:42:22,870 --> 03:42:22,880
quickly
 

13135
03:42:22,880 --> 03:42:25,110
quickly
with the current system money is credit

13136
03:42:25,110 --> 03:42:25,120
with the current system money is credit
 

13137

03:42:29,269 --> 03:42:29,279
to some point and the creation of credit
 

13141
03:42:29,279 --> 03:42:30,710
to some point and the creation of credit
is self-correcting i discussed this in

13142
03:42:30,710 --> 03:42:30,720
is self-correcting i discussed this in
 

13143
03:42:30,720 --> 03:42:32,950
is self-correcting i discussed this in
the fiat standard if you if if the

13144
03:42:32,950 --> 03:42:32,960
the fiat standard if you if if the
 

13145
03:42:32,960 --> 03:42:34,550
the fiat standard if you if if the
central bank allows banks to create too

13146
03:42:34,550 --> 03:42:34,560
central bank allows banks to create too
 

13147
03:42:34,560 --> 03:42:35,990
central bank allows banks to create too
much credit that creates a bubble and

13148
03:42:35,990 --> 03:42:36,000
much credit that creates a bubble and
 

13149
03:42:36,000 --> 03:42:37,429
much credit that creates a bubble and
then there's a collapse in the money

13150
03:42:37,429 --> 03:42:37,439
then there's a collapse in the money
 

13151
03:42:37,439 --> 03:42:39,670
then there's a collapse in the money
supply which prevents hyperinflation

13152
03:42:39,670 --> 03:42:39,680
supply which prevents hyperinflation
 

13153
03:42:39,680 --> 03:42:41,510
supply which prevents hyperinflation
from happening because the

13154
03:42:41,510 --> 03:42:41,520
from happening because the
 

13155
03:42:41,520 --> 03:42:43,269
from happening because the
you know the the money creation is

13156
03:42:43,269 --> 03:42:43,279
you know the the money creation is
 

13157
03:42:43,279 --> 03:42:45,910
you know the the money creation is
self-destructive it's self-correcting so

13158
03:42:45,910 --> 03:42:45,920
self-destructive it's self-correcting so
 

13159
03:42:45,920 --> 03:42:48,469
self-destructive it's self-correcting so
you end up with an average of like seven

13160
03:42:48,469 --> 03:42:48,479
you end up with an average of like seven
 

13161
03:42:48,479 --> 03:42:50,630
you end up with an average of like seven
percent per year increase because you

13162
03:42:50,630 --> 03:42:50,640
percent per year increase because you
 

13163
03:42:50,640 --> 03:42:53,030
percent per year increase because you
have ten percent for five years and then

13164
03:42:53,030 --> 03:42:53,040
have ten percent for five years and then
 

13165
03:42:53,040 --> 03:42:57,030
have ten percent for five years and then
you get negative 20 for one year and

13166
03:42:57,030 --> 03:42:57,040
you get negative 20 for one year and
 

13167
03:42:57,040 --> 03:42:58,469
you get negative 20 for one year and
it's correcting but now if you get rid

13168
03:42:58,469 --> 03:42:58,479
it's correcting but now if you get rid
 

13169
03:42:58,479 --> 03:43:00,070
it's correcting but now if you get rid
of the credit creation mechanism and

13170
03:43:00,070 --> 03:43:00,080
of the credit creation mechanism and
 

13171
03:43:00,080 --> 03:43:02,309
of the credit creation mechanism and
it's just assigning money directly we're

13172
03:43:02,309 --> 03:43:02,319
it's just assigning money directly we're
 

13173
03:43:02,319 --> 03:43:03,670
it's just assigning money directly we're
likely going to get much faster

13174
03:43:03,670 --> 03:43:03,680
likely going to get much faster
 

13175
03:43:03,680 --> 03:43:04,790
likely going to get much faster
inflation

13176
03:43:04,790 --> 03:43:04,800
inflation
 

13177
03:43:04,800 --> 03:43:07,750
inflation
and i think the that's obviously a huge

13178
03:43:07,750 --> 03:43:07,760
and i think the that's obviously a huge
 

13179
03:43:07,760 --> 03:43:09,750
and i think the that's obviously a huge
problem and perhaps the even bigger

13180
03:43:09,750 --> 03:43:09,760
problem and perhaps the even bigger
 

13181
03:43:09,760 --> 03:43:11,269
problem and perhaps the even bigger
problem is the

13182
03:43:11,269 --> 03:43:11,279
problem is the
 

13183
03:43:11,279 --> 03:43:13,189
problem is the
enormous amount of power that it gives

13184

enormous amount of power that it gives
 

13185
03:43:13,199 --> 03:43:15,429
enormous amount of power that it gives
to governments it's it's it allows them

i i certainly hope so i think this would
be a terrible thing if it comes to pass

be a terrible thing if it comes to pass

03:44:17,840 --> 03:44:19,189
be a terrible thing if it comes to pass
but i don't think many people think that

03:45:01,670 --> 03:45:01,680
we move
 

13297
03:45:01,680 --> 03:45:03,670
we move
from the fiat standard

13298
03:45:03,670 --> 03:45:03,680
from the fiat standard
 

13299
03:45:03,680 --> 03:45:05,590
from the fiat standard
back to the gold standard and then to

13300
03:45:05,590 --> 03:45:05,600
back to the gold standard and then to
 

13301
03:45:05,600 --> 03:45:07,590
back to the gold standard and then to
the bitcoin standard or skipping that

13302
03:45:07,590 --> 03:45:07,600
the bitcoin standard or skipping that
 

13303
03:45:07,600 --> 03:45:10,790
the bitcoin standard or skipping that
going directly to the bitcoin standard

13304
03:45:10,790 --> 03:45:10,800
going directly to the bitcoin standard
 

13305
03:45:10,800 --> 03:45:13,030
going directly to the bitcoin standard
what would it take is the gradual is

13306
03:45:13,030 --> 03:45:13,040
what would it take is the gradual is
 

13307
03:45:13,040 --> 03:45:14,630
what would it take is the gradual is
immediate

13308
03:45:14,630 --> 03:45:14,640
immediate
 

13309
03:45:14,640 --> 03:45:16,309
immediate
what are possible trajectories that take

13310
03:45:16,309 --> 03:45:16,319
what are possible trajectories that take
 

13311
03:45:16,319 --> 03:45:17,349
what are possible trajectories that take
us

13312
03:45:17,349 --> 03:45:17,359

well basically where the final sort of

13314
03:45:19,110 --> 03:45:19,120
well basically where the final sort of
 

13315
03:45:19,120 --> 03:45:20,950
well basically where the final sort of
empirical observation is that you

13316
03:45:20,950 --> 03:45:20,960
empirical observation is that you
 

13317
03:45:20,960 --> 03:45:22,150
empirical observation is that you
overtake

13318
03:45:22,150 --> 03:45:22,160
overtake
 

13319
03:45:22,160 --> 03:45:23,830

bitcoin overtakes

13320
03:45:23,830 --> 03:45:23,840
bitcoin overtakes
 

13321
03:45:23,840 --> 03:45:26,550
bitcoin overtakes
first gold and then bonds

13322
03:45:26,550 --> 03:45:26,560
first gold and then bonds
 

13323
03:45:26,560 --> 03:45:29,830

13327
03:45:31,600 --> 03:45:33,269
power in the world
but like just specifically from a

13328
03:45:33,269 --> 03:45:33,279
but like just specifically from a
 

13329
03:45:33,279 --> 03:45:35,030
but like just specifically from a
government perspective how how do we

13330
03:45:35,030 --> 03:45:35,040
government perspective how how do we
 

13331
03:45:35,040 --> 03:45:37,189
government perspective how how do we
move the united states china russia

13332
03:45:37,189 --> 03:45:37,199
move the united states china russia
 

13333
03:45:37,199 --> 03:45:38,950
move the united states china russia

to to a bitcoin standard

13338
03:45:43,189 --> 03:45:43,199
to to a bitcoin standard
 

13339
03:45:43,199 --> 03:45:45,110
to to a bitcoin standard
i'm not entirely concerned about whether

13340
03:45:45,110 --> 03:45:45,120
i'm not entirely concerned about whether
 

13341
03:45:45,120 --> 03:45:47,349
i'm not entirely concerned about whether
governments move or not in fact i'd be

13342
03:45:47,349 --> 03:45:47,359
governments move or not in fact i'd be
 

13343
03:45:47,359 --> 03:45:50,309
governments move or not in fact i'd be
very happy for them not to move as long

13344
03:45:50,309 --> 03:45:50,319
very happy for them not to move as long
 

13345
03:45:50,319 --> 03:45:51,670
very happy for them not to move as long
as possible

13346
03:45:51,670 --> 03:45:51,680
as possible
 

13347
03:45:51,680 --> 03:45:53,349
as possible
so that individuals can accumulate more

13348
03:45:53,349 --> 03:45:53,359
so that individuals can accumulate more
 

13349
03:45:53,359 --> 03:45:56,229
so that individuals can accumulate more
and more bitcoin while it's still cheap

13350
03:45:56,229 --> 03:45:56,239
and more bitcoin while it's still cheap
 

13351
03:45:56,239 --> 03:45:58,389
and more bitcoin while it's still cheap
so the people will move

13352
03:45:58,389 --> 03:45:58,399
so the people will move
 

13353
03:45:58,399 --> 03:46:01,269
so the people will move
and the governments will catch up

13354
03:46:01,269 --> 03:46:01,279
and the governments will catch up
 

13355
03:46:01,279 --> 03:46:03,189
and the governments will catch up
yeah and i think this is kind of what i

13356
03:46:03,189 --> 03:46:03,199
yeah and i think this is kind of what i
 

13357
03:46:03,199 --> 03:46:05,269
yeah and i think this is kind of what i
allude to i mean the point of the fiat

13358
03:46:05,269 --> 03:46:05,279
allude to i mean the point of the fiat
 

13359
03:46:05,279 --> 03:46:06,950
allude to i mean the point of the fiat
standard fiat standard is really a

13360
03:46:06,950 --> 03:46:06,960
standard fiat standard is really a
 

13361
03:46:06,960 --> 03:46:09,269
standard fiat standard is really a
bitcoin book and it talks about fiat

13362
03:46:09,269 --> 03:46:09,279
bitcoin book and it talks about fiat
 

13363
03:46:09,279 --> 03:46:11,110
bitcoin book and it talks about fiat
most of the time but it's

13364
03:46:11,110 --> 03:46:11,120
most of the time but it's
 

13365
03:46:11,120 --> 03:46:13,429
most of the time but it's
does so to analyze bitcoin and the rise

13366
03:46:13,429 --> 03:46:13,439
does so to analyze bitcoin and the rise
 

13367
03:46:13,439 --> 03:46:14,710
does so to analyze bitcoin and the rise
of bitcoin in the final chapter i

13368
03:46:14,710 --> 03:46:14,720
of bitcoin in the final chapter i
 

13369
03:46:14,720 --> 03:46:15,670
of bitcoin in the final chapter i
discuss

13370
03:46:15,670 --> 03:46:15,680
discuss
 

13371
03:46:15,680 --> 03:46:19,189
discuss
how i think this relationship plays out

13372
03:46:19,189 --> 03:46:19,199
how i think this relationship plays out
 

13373
03:46:19,199 --> 03:46:20,630
how i think this relationship plays out
um

13374
03:46:20,630 --> 03:46:20,640
um
 

13375
03:46:20,640 --> 03:46:23,269
um
i i i the way that i tend to think of it

13376
03:46:23,269 --> 03:46:23,279
i i i the way that i tend to think of it
 

13377
03:46:23,279 --> 03:46:24,630
i i i the way that i tend to think of it
is that most likely what's going to

13378
03:46:24,630 --> 03:46:24,640
is that most likely what's going to
 

13379
03:46:24,640 --> 03:46:26,550
is that most likely what's going to
happen is we're going to have

13380
03:46:26,550 --> 03:46:26,560
happen is we're going to have
 

13381
03:46:26,560 --> 03:46:28,710
happen is we're going to have
kind of uh financial apartheid where

13382
03:46:28,710 --> 03:46:28,720
kind of uh financial apartheid where
 

13383
03:46:28,720 --> 03:46:31,030
kind of uh financial apartheid where
there's going to be two monetary systems

13384
03:46:31,030 --> 03:46:31,040
there's going to be two monetary systems
 

13385
03:46:31,040 --> 03:46:33,590
there's going to be two monetary systems
one is government controlled

13386
03:46:33,590 --> 03:46:33,600
one is government controlled
 

13387
03:46:33,600 --> 03:46:35,429
one is government controlled
and it comes with increasing amounts of

13388
03:46:35,429 --> 03:46:35,439
and it comes with increasing amounts of
 

13389
03:46:35,439 --> 03:46:37,590
and it comes with increasing amounts of
surveillance and inflation

13390
03:46:37,590 --> 03:46:37,600
surveillance and inflation
 

13391
03:46:37,600 --> 03:46:40,309
surveillance and inflation
and then if you want you can just opt

13392
03:46:40,309 --> 03:46:40,319
and then if you want you can just opt
 

13393
03:46:40,319 --> 03:46:42,870
and then if you want you can just opt
out of that and get into bitcoin and

13394
03:46:42,870 --> 03:46:42,880
out of that and get into bitcoin and
 

13395
03:46:42,880 --> 03:46:45,110
out of that and get into bitcoin and
it's likely going to be difficult for

13396
03:46:45,110 --> 03:46:45,120
it's likely going to be difficult for
 

13397
03:46:45,120 --> 03:46:46,550
it's likely going to be difficult for
governments to stop people from getting

13398
03:46:46,550 --> 03:46:46,560
governments to stop people from getting
 

13399
03:46:46,560 --> 03:46:48,229
governments to stop people from getting
into bitcoin

13400
03:46:48,229 --> 03:46:48,239
into bitcoin
 

13401
03:46:48,239 --> 03:46:50,070
into bitcoin
for all the technical reasons that make

13402
03:46:50,070 --> 03:46:50,080
for all the technical reasons that make
 

13403
03:46:50,080 --> 03:46:52,150
for all the technical reasons that make
it very hard to stop bitcoin

13404
03:46:52,150 --> 03:46:52,160
it very hard to stop bitcoin
 

13405
03:46:52,160 --> 03:46:53,590
it very hard to stop bitcoin
so then we have this alternative that is

13406
03:46:53,590 --> 03:46:53,600
so then we have this alternative that is
 

13407
03:46:53,600 --> 03:46:56,790
so then we have this alternative that is
bitcoin which is not inflationary and

13408
03:46:56,790 --> 03:46:56,800
bitcoin which is not inflationary and
 

13409
03:46:56,800 --> 03:46:59,110
bitcoin which is not inflationary and
does not have a central authority that

13410
03:46:59,110 --> 03:46:59,120
does not have a central authority that
 

13411
03:46:59,120 --> 03:47:00,710
does not have a central authority that
can censor it

13412
03:47:00,710 --> 03:47:00,720
can censor it
 

13413
03:47:00,720 --> 03:47:01,830
can censor it
i think

13414
03:47:01,830 --> 03:47:01,840
i think
 

13415
03:47:01,840 --> 03:47:02,870
i think
um

13416
03:47:02,870 --> 03:47:02,880
um
 

13417
03:47:02,880 --> 03:47:05,750
um
gradually is my hope and i also think my

13418
03:47:05,750 --> 03:47:05,760
gradually is my hope and i also think my
 

13419
03:47:05,760 --> 03:47:08,389
gradually is my hope and i also think my
most likely scenario but maybe i am

13420
03:47:08,389 --> 03:47:08,399
most likely scenario but maybe i am
 

13421
03:47:08,399 --> 03:47:09,670
most likely scenario but maybe i am
biased because

13422
03:47:09,670 --> 03:47:09,680
biased because
 

13423
03:47:09,680 --> 03:47:11,590
biased because
everybody thinks what they want is

13424
03:47:11,590 --> 03:47:11,600
everybody thinks what they want is
 

13425
03:47:11,600 --> 03:47:12,870
everybody thinks what they want is
what's going to happen

13426
03:47:12,870 --> 03:47:12,880
what's going to happen
 

13427
03:47:12,880 --> 03:47:14,469
what's going to happen
i think we're just going to witness you

13428
03:47:14,469 --> 03:47:14,479
i think we're just going to witness you
 

13429
03:47:14,479 --> 03:47:16,870
i think we're just going to witness you
know the same relationship because

13430
03:47:16,870 --> 03:47:16,880
know the same relationship because
 

13431
03:47:16,880 --> 03:47:18,950
know the same relationship because
governments make their currency so that

13432
03:47:18,950 --> 03:47:18,960
governments make their currency so that
 

13433
03:47:18,960 --> 03:47:20,630
governments make their currency so that
they can devalue them

13434
03:47:20,630 --> 03:47:20,640
they can devalue them
 

13435
03:47:20,640 --> 03:47:22,870
they can devalue them
and bitcoin thrives on that and more and

13436
03:47:22,870 --> 03:47:22,880
and bitcoin thrives on that and more and
 

13437
03:47:22,880 --> 03:47:24,229
and bitcoin thrives on that and more and
more people are going to learn more and

13438
03:47:24,229 --> 03:47:24,239
more people are going to learn more and
 

13439
03:47:24,239 --> 03:47:25,990
more people are going to learn more and
more people are going to find out

13440
03:47:25,990 --> 03:47:26,000
more people are going to find out
 

13441
03:47:26,000 --> 03:47:27,990
more people are going to find out
and whether it's through

13442
03:47:27,990 --> 03:47:28,000
and whether it's through
 

13443
03:47:28,000 --> 03:47:30,229
and whether it's through
curiosity or self-interest or through

13444
03:47:30,229 --> 03:47:30,239
curiosity or self-interest or through
 

13445
03:47:30,239 --> 03:47:32,309
curiosity or self-interest or through
the destruction of the national currency

13446
03:47:32,309 --> 03:47:32,319
the destruction of the national currency
 

13447
03:47:32,319 --> 03:47:35,189
the destruction of the national currency
all roads lead to bitcoin so more and

13448
03:47:35,189 --> 03:47:35,199
all roads lead to bitcoin so more and
 

13449
03:47:35,199 --> 03:47:36,389
all roads lead to bitcoin so more and
more people are going to buy bitcoin the

13450
03:47:36,389 --> 03:47:36,399
more people are going to buy bitcoin the
 

13451
03:47:36,399 --> 03:47:38,070
more people are going to buy bitcoin the
price of bitcoin is going to go up and

13452
03:47:38,070 --> 03:47:38,080
price of bitcoin is going to go up and
 

13453
03:47:38,080 --> 03:47:40,229
price of bitcoin is going to go up and
as it goes up bitcoin becomes a more

13454
03:47:40,229 --> 03:47:40,239
as it goes up bitcoin becomes a more
 

13455
03:47:40,239 --> 03:47:41,910
as it goes up bitcoin becomes a more

13819
03:53:37,040 --> 03:53:39,030

but you argue that those are actually

but you argue that those are actually
 

13821
03:53:39,040 --> 03:53:41,189
but you argue that those are actually

but yeah and i don't think he would
disagree but it would uh but a book has

you know can only be so long i suppose
it can only focus on

it can only focus on
so many things

you know the past four hours have been a
 

13843
03:54:00,960 --> 03:54:03,030
you know the past four hours have been a
kind of advice but if you can

kind of advice but if you can
 

13845
03:54:03,040 --> 03:54:05,349
kind of advice but if you can
focus and if somebody in high school or

03:54:07,600 --> 03:54:09,670
college is thinking about
what to do with their career can have a

13850
03:54:09,670 --> 03:54:09,680
what to do with their career can have a
 

13851

13855
03:54:13,520 --> 03:54:15,110
can be proud of what would you tell them
i'd say probably the most important

13856
03:54:15,110 --> 03:54:15,120
i'd say probably the most important
 

13857
03:54:15,120 --> 03:54:16,950
i'd say probably the most important
advice that i would give is to find a

13858
03:54:16,950 --> 03:54:16,960
advice that i would give is to find a
 

13859
03:54:16,960 --> 03:54:20,070
advice that i would give is to find a
way to give value to other people and

13860
03:54:20,070 --> 03:54:20,080
way to give value to other people and
 

13861
03:54:20,080 --> 03:54:22,550
way to give value to other people and
this is really the key thing you need to

13862
03:54:22,550 --> 03:54:22,560
this is really the key thing you need to
 

13863
03:54:22,560 --> 03:54:24,469
this is really the key thing you need to
wake up every morning and figure out how

13864
03:54:24,469 --> 03:54:24,479
wake up every morning and figure out how
 

13865
03:54:24,479 --> 03:54:26,710
wake up every morning and figure out how
to serve others this is

13866
03:54:26,710 --> 03:54:26,720
to serve others this is
 

13867
03:54:26,720 --> 03:54:29,349
to serve others this is
this is the key to everything you want

13868
03:54:29,349 --> 03:54:29,359
this is the key to everything you want
 

13869
03:54:29,359 --> 03:54:31,590
this is the key to everything you want
in life everything that you want is on

13870
03:54:31,590 --> 03:54:31,600
in life everything that you want is on
 

13871
03:54:31,600 --> 03:54:34,469
in life everything that you want is on
the other side of you serving others so

13872
03:54:34,469 --> 03:54:34,479
the other side of you serving others so
 

13873
03:54:34,479 --> 03:54:36,309
the other side of you serving others so
figure out how you can serve others in a

13874
03:54:36,309 --> 03:54:36,319
figure out how you can serve others in a
 

13875
03:54:36,319 --> 03:54:37,590
figure out how you can serve others in a
good way

13876
03:54:37,590 --> 03:54:37,600
good way
 

13877
03:54:37,600 --> 03:54:38,870
good way
how you can do it in a way that they

13878
03:54:38,870 --> 03:54:38,880
how you can do it in a way that they
 

13879
03:54:38,880 --> 03:54:41,590
how you can do it in a way that they
value and you've got an incredible

13880
03:54:41,590 --> 03:54:41,600
value and you've got an incredible
 

13881
03:54:41,600 --> 03:54:43,510
value and you've got an incredible
mechanism for figuring that out which is

13882
03:54:43,510 --> 03:54:43,520
mechanism for figuring that out which is
 

13883
03:54:43,520 --> 03:54:44,950
mechanism for figuring that out which is
the market

13884
03:54:44,950 --> 03:54:44,960
the market
 

13885
03:54:44,960 --> 03:54:46,550
the market
go out there and do things for other

13886
03:54:46,550 --> 03:54:46,560
go out there and do things for other
 

13887
03:54:46,560 --> 03:54:48,870
go out there and do things for other
people and um you know the market will

13888
03:54:48,870 --> 03:54:48,880
people and um you know the market will
 

13889
03:54:48,880 --> 03:54:50,630
people and um you know the market will
tell you the market will tell you

13890
03:54:50,630 --> 03:54:50,640
tell you the market will tell you
 

13891
03:54:50,640 --> 03:54:52,469
tell you the market will tell you
exactly if you're young you have the

13892
03:54:52,469 --> 03:54:52,479
exactly if you're young you have the
 

13893
03:54:52,479 --> 03:54:54,870
exactly if you're young you have the
enormous advantage of being able to make

13894
03:54:54,870 --> 03:54:54,880
enormous advantage of being able to make
 

13895
03:54:54,880 --> 03:54:56,870
enormous advantage of being able to make
things make mistakes essentially and

13896
03:54:56,870 --> 03:54:56,880
things make mistakes essentially and
 

13897
03:54:56,880 --> 03:54:58,070
things make mistakes essentially and
learn from them

13898
03:54:58,070 --> 03:54:58,080
learn from them
 

13899
03:54:58,080 --> 03:54:59,510
learn from them
so

13900
03:54:59,510 --> 03:54:59,520
so
 

13901
03:54:59,520 --> 03:55:01,349
so
go out there do things of value for

13902
03:55:01,349 --> 03:55:01,359
go out there do things of value for
 

13903
03:55:01,359 --> 03:55:03,910
go out there do things of value for
others figuring out how you can do

13904
03:55:03,910 --> 03:55:03,920
others figuring out how you can do
 

13905
03:55:03,920 --> 03:55:04,950
others figuring out how you can do
something

13906
03:55:04,950 --> 03:55:04,960
something
 

13907
03:55:04,960 --> 03:55:07,110
something
that pre-contra what is it that you can

13908
03:55:07,110 --> 03:55:07,120
that pre-contra what is it that you can
 

13909
03:55:07,120 --> 03:55:08,550
that pre-contra what is it that you can
do that contributes the most value to

13910
03:55:08,550 --> 03:55:08,560
do that contributes the most value to
 

13911
03:55:08,560 --> 03:55:09,990
do that contributes the most value to
other people's lives

13912
03:55:09,990 --> 03:55:10,000
other people's lives
 

13913
03:55:10,000 --> 03:55:12,469
other people's lives
and increasingly i think with the modern

13914
03:55:12,469 --> 03:55:12,479
and increasingly i think with the modern
 

13915
03:55:12,479 --> 03:55:14,710
and increasingly i think with the modern
technology this is increasingly becoming

13916
03:55:14,710 --> 03:55:14,720
technology this is increasingly becoming
 

13917
03:55:14,720 --> 03:55:17,189
technology this is increasingly becoming
online and it's uh

13918
03:55:17,189 --> 03:55:17,199
online and it's uh
 

13919
03:55:17,199 --> 03:55:18,950
online and it's uh
i think you know you should consider how

13920
03:55:18,950 --> 03:55:18,960
i think you know you should consider how
 

13921
03:55:18,960 --> 03:55:19,830
i think you know you should consider how
you can

13922
03:55:19,830 --> 03:55:19,840
you can
 

13923
03:55:19,840 --> 03:55:22,550
you can
create value online because that sk

13924
03:55:22,550 --> 03:55:22,560
create value online because that sk
 

13925
03:55:22,560 --> 03:55:23,750
create value online because that sk
scales

13926
03:55:23,750 --> 03:55:23,760
scales
 

13927
03:55:23,760 --> 03:55:25,429
scales
beyond anything you can do in the

13928
03:55:25,429 --> 03:55:25,439
beyond anything you can do in the
 

13929
03:55:25,439 --> 03:55:28,150
beyond anything you can do in the
physical world in a very very uh well

13930
03:55:28,150 --> 03:55:28,160
physical world in a very very uh well
 

13931
03:55:28,160 --> 03:55:29,590
physical world in a very very uh well
maybe not beyond obviously there are

13932
03:55:29,590 --> 03:55:29,600
maybe not beyond obviously there are
 

13933
03:55:29,600 --> 03:55:31,830
maybe not beyond obviously there are
profitable businesses in in

13934
03:55:31,830 --> 03:55:31,840
profitable businesses in in
 

13935
03:55:31,840 --> 03:55:34,309
profitable businesses in in
in the physical world but i think online

13936
03:55:34,309 --> 03:55:34,319
in the physical world but i think online
 

13937
03:55:34,319 --> 03:55:36,469
in the physical world but i think online
is enormous potential

13938
03:55:36,469 --> 03:55:36,479
is enormous potential
 

13939
03:55:36,479 --> 03:55:38,389
is enormous potential
and coding i think is enormously

13940
03:55:38,389 --> 03:55:38,399
and coding i think is enormously
 

13941
03:55:38,399 --> 03:55:40,229
and coding i think is enormously
powerful i'm not a coder myself but i

13942
03:55:40,229 --> 03:55:40,239
powerful i'm not a coder myself but i
 

13943
03:55:40,239 --> 03:55:42,070
powerful i'm not a coder myself but i
strongly recommend people get into

13944
03:55:42,070 --> 03:55:42,080
strongly recommend people get into
 

13945
03:55:42,080 --> 03:55:43,990
strongly recommend people get into
learning how to code

13946
03:55:43,990 --> 03:55:44,000
learning how to code
 

13947
03:55:44,000 --> 03:55:46,229
learning how to code
and i think it's it's probably the thing

13948
03:55:46,229 --> 03:55:46,239
and i think it's it's probably the thing
 

13949
03:55:46,239 --> 03:55:48,150
and i think it's it's probably the thing
that carries the most uh

13950
03:55:48,150 --> 03:55:48,160
that carries the most uh
 

13951
03:55:48,160 --> 03:55:50,389
that carries the most uh
power so initially we were working with

13952
03:55:50,389 --> 03:55:50,399
power so initially we were working with
 

13953
03:55:50,399 --> 03:55:52,150
power so initially we were working with
our hands we started working with

13954
03:55:52,150 --> 03:55:52,160
our hands we started working with
 

13955
03:55:52,160 --> 03:55:53,429
our hands we started working with
machines machines are much more

13956
03:55:53,429 --> 03:55:53,439
machines machines are much more
 

13957
03:55:53,439 --> 03:55:56,389
machines machines are much more
productive well code is an even higher

13958
03:55:56,389 --> 03:55:56,399
productive well code is an even higher
 

13959
03:55:56,399 --> 03:55:57,990
productive well code is an even higher
level of productivity where you

13960
03:55:57,990 --> 03:55:58,000
level of productivity where you
 

13961
03:55:58,000 --> 03:55:59,990
level of productivity where you
basically program the machines to

13962
03:55:59,990 --> 03:56:00,000
basically program the machines to
 

13963
03:56:00,000 --> 03:56:01,590
basically program the machines to
produce things so

13964
03:56:01,590 --> 03:56:01,600
produce things so
 

13965
03:56:01,600 --> 03:56:05,269
produce things so
um you know few clicks of a keyboard and

13966
03:56:05,269 --> 03:56:05,279
um you know few clicks of a keyboard and
 

13967
03:56:05,279 --> 03:56:07,510
um you know few clicks of a keyboard and
you can move millions of machines around

13968
03:56:07,510 --> 03:56:07,520
you can move millions of machines around
 

13969
03:56:07,520 --> 03:56:09,990
you can move millions of machines around
the world in certain ways so it carries

13970
03:56:09,990 --> 03:56:10,000
the world in certain ways so it carries
 

13971
03:56:10,000 --> 03:56:12,630
the world in certain ways so it carries
an enormous amount of value i think um

13972
03:56:12,630 --> 03:56:12,640
an enormous amount of value i think um
 

13973
03:56:12,640 --> 03:56:14,630
an enormous amount of value i think um
i always tell all young people to learn

13974
03:56:14,630 --> 03:56:14,640
i always tell all young people to learn
 

13975
03:56:14,640 --> 03:56:16,229
i always tell all young people to learn
to code it's the best thing

13976
03:56:16,229 --> 03:56:16,239
to code it's the best thing
 

13977
03:56:16,239 --> 03:56:17,590
to code it's the best thing
i used to tell it to my students when i

13978
03:56:17,590 --> 03:56:17,600
i used to tell it to my students when i
 

13979
03:56:17,600 --> 03:56:19,750
i used to tell it to my students when i
was at university i tell them to drop

13980
03:56:19,750 --> 03:56:19,760
was at university i tell them to drop
 

13981
03:56:19,760 --> 03:56:21,990
was at university i tell them to drop
out and go learn to code it's probably a

13982
03:56:21,990 --> 03:56:22,000
out and go learn to code it's probably a
 

13983
03:56:22,000 --> 03:56:23,670
out and go learn to code it's probably a
better use of their time and money we

13984
03:56:23,670 --> 03:56:23,680
better use of their time and money we
 

13985
03:56:23,680 --> 03:56:25,269
better use of their time and money we
could probably do both

13986
03:56:25,269 --> 03:56:25,279
could probably do both
 

13987
03:56:25,279 --> 03:56:27,349
could probably do both
yeah university has an interesting

13988
03:56:27,349 --> 03:56:27,359
yeah university has an interesting
 

13989
03:56:27,359 --> 03:56:28,790
yeah university has an interesting
function i mean

13990
03:56:28,790 --> 03:56:28,800
function i mean
 

13991
03:56:28,800 --> 03:56:29,750
function i mean
probably you and i have different

13992
03:56:29,750 --> 03:56:29,760
probably you and i have different
 

13993
03:56:29,760 --> 03:56:31,429
probably you and i have different
perspective on this probably has to do

13994
03:56:31,429 --> 03:56:31,439
perspective on this probably has to do
 

13995
03:56:31,439 --> 03:56:33,189
perspective on this probably has to do
with a little bit of a different journey

13996
03:56:33,189 --> 03:56:33,199
with a little bit of a different journey
 

13997
03:56:33,199 --> 03:56:35,110
with a little bit of a different journey
in terms of um

13998
03:56:35,110 --> 03:56:35,120
in terms of um
 

13999
03:56:35,120 --> 03:56:36,710
in terms of um
fields because i'm so

14000
03:56:36,710 --> 03:56:36,720
fields because i'm so
 

14001
03:56:36,720 --> 03:56:38,469
fields because i'm so
i've stayed engineering focused for a

14002
03:56:38,469 --> 03:56:38,479
i've stayed engineering focused for a
 

14003
03:56:38,479 --> 03:56:40,630
i've stayed engineering focused for a
long time and there's less some of the

14004
03:56:40,630 --> 03:56:40,640
long time and there's less some of the
 

14005
03:56:40,640 --> 03:56:41,830
long time and there's less some of the
troubles you might highlight in the

14006
03:56:41,830 --> 03:56:41,840
troubles you might highlight in the
 

14007
03:56:41,840 --> 03:56:44,070
troubles you might highlight in the
education system there's less troubles

14008
03:56:44,070 --> 03:56:44,080
education system there's less troubles
 

14009
03:56:44,080 --> 03:56:45,510
education system there's less troubles
of that kind

14010
03:56:45,510 --> 03:56:45,520
of that kind
 

14011
03:56:45,520 --> 03:56:47,429
of that kind
in engineering because

14012
03:56:47,429 --> 03:56:47,439
in engineering because
 

14013
03:56:47,439 --> 03:56:50,389
in engineering because
math hasn't changed for a long time so

14014
03:56:50,389 --> 03:56:50,399
math hasn't changed for a long time so
 

14015
03:56:50,399 --> 03:56:52,710
math hasn't changed for a long time so
yeah it's a lot of it is just doing hard

14016
03:56:52,710 --> 03:56:52,720
yeah it's a lot of it is just doing hard
 

14017
03:56:52,720 --> 03:56:55,349
yeah it's a lot of it is just doing hard
things being forced to do hard things

14018
03:56:55,349 --> 03:56:55,359
things being forced to do hard things
 

14019
03:56:55,359 --> 03:56:57,990
things being forced to do hard things
and becoming a bit of a generalist while

14020
03:56:57,990 --> 03:56:58,000
and becoming a bit of a generalist while
 

14021
03:56:58,000 --> 03:56:59,670
and becoming a bit of a generalist while
on the side you're also becoming a

14022
03:56:59,670 --> 03:56:59,680
on the side you're also becoming a
 

14023
03:56:59,680 --> 03:57:01,670
on the side you're also becoming a
specialist

14024
03:57:01,670 --> 03:57:01,680
specialist
 

14025
03:57:01,680 --> 03:57:03,910
specialist
based on your own passion by your own

14026
03:57:03,910 --> 03:57:03,920
based on your own passion by your own
 

14027
03:57:03,920 --> 03:57:06,630
based on your own passion by your own
passion so school at least high school i

14028
03:57:06,630 --> 03:57:06,640
passion so school at least high school i
 

14029
03:57:06,640 --> 03:57:08,309
passion so school at least high school i
don't know about the university but high

14030
03:57:08,309 --> 03:57:08,319
don't know about the university but high
 

14031
03:57:08,319 --> 03:57:09,189
don't know about the university but high
school

14032
03:57:09,189 --> 03:57:09,199
school
 

14033
03:57:09,199 --> 03:57:11,429
school
that's a really nice

14034
03:57:11,429 --> 03:57:11,439
that's a really nice
 

14035
03:57:11,439 --> 03:57:13,510
that's a really nice
one of the only times in your life at

14036
03:57:13,510 --> 03:57:13,520
one of the only times in your life at
 

14037
03:57:13,520 --> 03:57:15,510
one of the only times in your life at
least in my life

14038
03:57:15,510 --> 03:57:15,520
least in my life
 

14039
03:57:15,520 --> 03:57:17,189
least in my life
i was forced

14040
03:57:17,189 --> 03:57:17,199
i was forced
 

14041
03:57:17,199 --> 03:57:19,110
i was forced
but now i see

14042
03:57:19,110 --> 03:57:19,120
but now i see
 

14043
03:57:19,120 --> 03:57:21,349
but now i see
uh given the opportunity to spend my

14044
03:57:21,349 --> 03:57:21,359
uh given the opportunity to spend my
 

14045
03:57:21,359 --> 03:57:22,950
uh given the opportunity to spend my
entire day learning

14046
03:57:22,950 --> 03:57:22,960
entire day learning
 

14047
03:57:22,960 --> 03:57:24,309
entire day learning
broadly

14048
03:57:24,309 --> 03:57:24,319
broadly
 

14049
03:57:24,319 --> 03:57:25,910
broadly
and that's something i don't know the

14050
03:57:25,910 --> 03:57:25,920
and that's something i don't know the
 

14051
03:57:25,920 --> 03:57:27,670
and that's something i don't know the
way time works it just runs away from

14052
03:57:27,670 --> 03:57:27,680
way time works it just runs away from
 

14053
03:57:27,680 --> 03:57:30,070
way time works it just runs away from
you you never really get a chance to do

14054
03:57:30,070 --> 03:57:30,080
you you never really get a chance to do
 

14055
03:57:30,080 --> 03:57:32,550
you you never really get a chance to do
learn quite that broadly

14056
03:57:32,550 --> 03:57:32,560
learn quite that broadly
 

14057
03:57:32,560 --> 03:57:34,309
learn quite that broadly
again yeah that's the curse of

14058
03:57:34,309 --> 03:57:34,319
again yeah that's the curse of
 

14059
03:57:34,319 --> 03:57:36,469
again yeah that's the curse of
specialization is you kind of

14060
03:57:36,469 --> 03:57:36,479
specialization is you kind of
 

14061
03:57:36,479 --> 03:57:38,550
specialization is you kind of
never get a chance to study biology

14062
03:57:38,550 --> 03:57:38,560
never get a chance to study biology
 

14063
03:57:38,560 --> 03:57:41,189
never get a chance to study biology
chemistry if you're a physicist on you

14064
03:57:41,189 --> 03:57:41,199
chemistry if you're a physicist on you
 

14065
03:57:41,199 --> 03:57:43,189
chemistry if you're a physicist on you
know time runs away from you so it's

14066
03:57:43,189 --> 03:57:43,199
know time runs away from you so it's
 

14067
03:57:43,199 --> 03:57:45,510
know time runs away from you so it's
enjoy the the broad

14068
03:57:45,510 --> 03:57:45,520
enjoy the the broad
 

14069
03:57:45,520 --> 03:57:47,269
enjoy the the broad
uh the broad education of it but yeah

14070
03:57:47,269 --> 03:57:47,279
uh the broad education of it but yeah
 

14071
03:57:47,279 --> 03:57:48,630
uh the broad education of it but yeah
like you said

14072
03:57:48,630 --> 03:57:48,640
like you said
 

14073
03:57:48,640 --> 03:57:50,389
like you said
find the things that

14074
03:57:50,389 --> 03:57:50,399
find the things that
 

14075
03:57:50,399 --> 03:57:53,110
find the things that
valued by the market

14076
03:57:53,110 --> 03:57:53,120
valued by the market
 

14077
03:57:53,120 --> 03:57:55,349
valued by the market
and on the other side of it you said all

14078
03:57:55,349 --> 03:57:55,359
and on the other side of it you said all
 

14079
03:57:55,359 --> 03:57:57,110
and on the other side of it you said all
the good stuff so that's also a way to

14080
03:57:57,110 --> 03:57:57,120
the good stuff so that's also a way to
 

14081
03:57:57,120 --> 03:57:58,389
the good stuff so that's also a way to
get happiness

14082
03:57:58,389 --> 03:57:58,399
get happiness
 

14083
03:57:58,399 --> 03:58:00,630
get happiness
yeah and i'd also add the horse that i

14084
03:58:00,630 --> 03:58:00,640
yeah and i'd also add the horse that i
 

14085
03:58:00,640 --> 03:58:02,229
yeah and i'd also add the horse that i

to have a form of property that they can
keep and so

04:07:25,429 --> 04:07:25,439
of the hate that is brewing the
 

14637
04:07:25,439 --> 04:07:27,349
of the hate that is brewing the
suffering that is brewing

suffering that is brewing
 

14639
04:07:27,359 --> 04:07:32,070
suffering that is brewing
based on decisions and pressures and

14640
04:07:32,070 --> 04:07:32,080

 

14641
04:07:32,080 --> 04:07:35,110

from not always people directly

14642
04:07:35,110 --> 04:07:35,120
from not always people directly
 

14643
04:07:35,120 --> 04:07:36,630
from not always people directly
impacted by this

14644
04:07:36,630 --> 04:07:36,640
impacted by this
 

14645
04:07:36,640 --> 04:07:37,830
impacted by this
so again

14646
04:07:37,830 --> 04:07:37,840
so again
 

14647
04:07:37,840 --> 04:07:41,030
so again
it feels like that military conflict is

14648
04:07:41,030 --> 04:07:41,040
it feels like that military conflict is
 

14649
04:07:41,040 --> 04:07:43,349
it feels like that military conflict is
not just a creation of

14650
04:07:43,349 --> 04:07:43,359
not just a creation of
 

14651
04:07:43,359 --> 04:07:45,429
not just a creation of
like uh people on the ground it's the

14652
04:07:45,429 --> 04:07:45,439
like uh people on the ground it's the
 

14653
04:07:45,439 --> 04:07:48,070
like uh people on the ground it's the
creation of leaders power centers

14654
04:07:48,070 --> 04:07:48,080
creation of leaders power centers
 

14655
04:07:48,080 --> 04:07:49,429
creation of leaders power centers
and um

14656
04:07:49,429 --> 04:07:49,439
and um
 

14657
04:07:49,439 --> 04:07:51,030
and um
and perhaps

14658
04:07:51,030 --> 04:07:51,040
and perhaps
 

14659
04:07:51,040 --> 04:07:52,790
and perhaps
again i'm not smart enough but even the

14660
04:07:52,790 --> 04:07:52,800
again i'm not smart enough but even the
 

14661
04:07:52,800 --> 04:07:55,030
again i'm not smart enough but even the
monetary system probably has a role to

04:07:55,030 --> 04:07:55,040
monetary system probably has a role to
 

14663
04:07:55,040 --> 04:07:57,429
monetary system probably has a role to
play i absolutely think it does monetary

14664
04:07:57,429 --> 04:07:57,439
play i absolutely think it does monetary
 

14665
04:07:57,439 --> 04:07:59,670
play i absolutely think it does monetary
system is what allows um

14666
04:07:59,670 --> 04:07:59,680

04:08:01,269 --> 04:08:01,279
is what allows people to just continue
 

14669
04:08:01,279 --> 04:08:04,070
is what allows people to just continue
