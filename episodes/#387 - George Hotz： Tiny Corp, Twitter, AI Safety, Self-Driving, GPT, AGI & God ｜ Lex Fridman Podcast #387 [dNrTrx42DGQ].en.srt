how human species ends sure so I think

00:00:04,920 --> 00:00:06,769
how human species ends sure so I think
the most obvious way to me is

00:00:06,769 --> 00:00:06,779
the most obvious way to me is

00:00:06,779 --> 00:00:08,030
the most obvious way to me is
wireheading

00:00:19,189 --> 00:00:19,199
maybe maybe it's even more benign than
 

17
00:00:19,199 --> 00:00:22,790
maybe maybe it's even more benign than
this maybe we all just stop reproducing

thing about humanity is the diversity oh
 

25
00:00:30,960 --> 00:00:33,229
thing about humanity is the diversity oh
yeah organisms in general there's a lot

you mentioned something in a stream

80
00:01:41,090 --> 00:01:41,100
you mentioned something in a stream
 

81
00:01:41,100 --> 00:01:43,370
you mentioned something in a stream
about the philosophical nature of time

82
00:01:43,370 --> 00:01:43,380
about the philosophical nature of time
 

83
00:01:43,380 --> 00:01:45,530
about the philosophical nature of time
so uh let's start with the wild question

84
00:01:45,530 --> 00:01:45,540
so uh let's start with the wild question
 

85
00:01:45,540 --> 00:01:49,910
so uh let's start with the wild question
do you think time is an illusion

86
00:01:49,910 --> 00:01:49,920

 

87
00:01:49,920 --> 00:01:51,170

you know

88
00:01:51,170 --> 00:01:51,180
you know
 

89
00:01:51,180 --> 00:01:54,350
you know
I sell phone calls uh to comma for a

90
00:01:54,350 --> 00:01:54,360
I sell phone calls uh to comma for a
 

91
00:01:54,360 --> 00:01:56,210
I sell phone calls uh to comma for a
thousand dollars uh and some guy called

92
00:01:56,210 --> 00:01:56,220
thousand dollars uh and some guy called
 

93
00:01:56,220 --> 00:01:59,270
thousand dollars uh and some guy called
me and uh like you know it's a thousand

94
00:01:59,270 --> 00:01:59,280
me and uh like you know it's a thousand
 

95
00:01:59,280 --> 00:02:00,590
me and uh like you know it's a thousand
dollars you can talk to me for for half

96
00:02:00,590 --> 00:02:00,600
dollars you can talk to me for for half
 

97
00:02:00,600 --> 00:02:03,889
dollars you can talk to me for for half
an hour and he's like uh yeah okay so

98
00:02:03,889 --> 00:02:03,899
an hour and he's like uh yeah okay so
 

99
00:02:03,899 --> 00:02:06,469
an hour and he's like uh yeah okay so
like time doesn't exist and I really

100
00:02:06,469 --> 00:02:06,479
like time doesn't exist and I really
 

101
00:02:06,479 --> 00:02:08,449
like time doesn't exist and I really
wanted to share this with you

102
00:02:08,449 --> 00:02:08,459
wanted to share this with you
 

103
00:02:08,459 --> 00:02:10,130
wanted to share this with you
I'm like oh what do you mean time

104
00:02:10,130 --> 00:02:10,140
I'm like oh what do you mean time
 

105
00:02:10,140 --> 00:02:12,290
I'm like oh what do you mean time
doesn't exist right like I think time is

106
00:02:12,290 --> 00:02:12,300
doesn't exist right like I think time is
 

107
00:02:12,300 --> 00:02:14,809
doesn't exist right like I think time is
a useful model whether it exists or not

108
00:02:14,809 --> 00:02:14,819
a useful model whether it exists or not
 

109
00:02:14,819 --> 00:02:16,790
a useful model whether it exists or not
right like does quantum physics exist

110
00:02:16,790 --> 00:02:16,800
right like does quantum physics exist
 

111
00:02:16,800 --> 00:02:19,010
right like does quantum physics exist
well it doesn't matter it's about

112
00:02:19,010 --> 00:02:19,020
well it doesn't matter it's about
 

113
00:02:19,020 --> 00:02:21,290
well it doesn't matter it's about
whether it's a useful model to describe

114
00:02:21,290 --> 00:02:21,300
whether it's a useful model to describe
 

115
00:02:21,300 --> 00:02:25,070
whether it's a useful model to describe
reality is time maybe compressive

116
00:02:25,070 --> 00:02:25,080
reality is time maybe compressive
 

117
00:02:25,080 --> 00:02:26,630
reality is time maybe compressive
do you think there is an objective

118
00:02:26,630 --> 00:02:26,640
do you think there is an objective
 

119
00:02:26,640 --> 00:02:28,430
do you think there is an objective
reality or is everything just useful

120
00:02:28,430 --> 00:02:28,440
reality or is everything just useful
 

121
00:02:28,440 --> 00:02:29,570
reality or is everything just useful
models

122
00:02:29,570 --> 00:02:29,580
models
 

123
00:02:29,580 --> 00:02:33,170
models
all right Underneath It All Is there an

124
00:02:33,170 --> 00:02:33,180
all right Underneath It All Is there an
 

125
00:02:33,180 --> 00:02:34,910
all right Underneath It All Is there an
actual thing that we're constructing

126
00:02:34,910 --> 00:02:34,920
actual thing that we're constructing
 

127
00:02:34,920 --> 00:02:37,610
actual thing that we're constructing
models for

128
00:02:37,610 --> 00:02:37,620

 

129
00:02:37,620 --> 00:02:39,350

I don't know

130
00:02:39,350 --> 00:02:39,360
I don't know
 

131
00:02:39,360 --> 00:02:40,790
I don't know
I was hoping you would know I don't

132
00:02:40,790 --> 00:02:40,800
I was hoping you would know I don't
 

133
00:02:40,800 --> 00:02:41,869
I was hoping you would know I don't
think it matters

134
00:02:41,869 --> 00:02:41,879
think it matters
 

135
00:02:41,879 --> 00:02:44,150
think it matters
I mean this kind of connects to the

136
00:02:44,150 --> 00:02:44,160
I mean this kind of connects to the
 

137
00:02:44,160 --> 00:02:45,530
I mean this kind of connects to the
models of constructive reality with

138
00:02:45,530 --> 00:02:45,540
models of constructive reality with
 

139
00:02:45,540 --> 00:02:46,970
models of constructive reality with
machine learning

140
00:02:46,970 --> 00:02:46,980
machine learning
 

141
00:02:46,980 --> 00:02:50,809
machine learning
right sure like is it just nice to have

142
00:02:50,809 --> 00:02:50,819
right sure like is it just nice to have
 

143
00:02:50,819 --> 00:02:53,270
right sure like is it just nice to have
useful approximations of the world such

144
00:02:53,270 --> 00:02:53,280
useful approximations of the world such
 

145
00:02:53,280 --> 00:02:55,309
useful approximations of the world such
that we can do something with it so

146
00:02:55,309 --> 00:02:55,319
that we can do something with it so
 

147
00:02:55,319 --> 00:02:57,110
that we can do something with it so
there are things that are real column

148
00:02:57,110 --> 00:02:57,120
there are things that are real column
 

149
00:02:57,120 --> 00:02:59,150
there are things that are real column
graph complexity is real

150
00:02:59,150 --> 00:02:59,160
graph complexity is real
 

151
00:02:59,160 --> 00:03:02,270
graph complexity is real
yeah yeah the compressive thing math is

152
00:03:02,270 --> 00:03:02,280
yeah yeah the compressive thing math is
 

153
00:03:02,280 --> 00:03:03,890
yeah yeah the compressive thing math is
real yeah

154
00:03:03,890 --> 00:03:03,900
real yeah
 

155
00:03:03,900 --> 00:03:06,050
real yeah
it should be a T-shirt and I think hard

156
00:03:06,050 --> 00:03:06,060
it should be a T-shirt and I think hard
 

157
00:03:06,060 --> 00:03:07,729
it should be a T-shirt and I think hard
things are actually hard I don't think P

158
00:03:07,729 --> 00:03:07,739
things are actually hard I don't think P
 

159
00:03:07,739 --> 00:03:11,030
things are actually hard I don't think P
equals NP ooh strong words well I think

160
00:03:11,030 --> 00:03:11,040
equals NP ooh strong words well I think
 

161
00:03:11,040 --> 00:03:13,070
equals NP ooh strong words well I think
that's the majority I do think factoring

162
00:03:13,070 --> 00:03:13,080
that's the majority I do think factoring
 

163
00:03:13,080 --> 00:03:15,170
that's the majority I do think factoring
is in P but I don't think you're the

164
00:03:15,170 --> 00:03:15,180
is in P but I don't think you're the
 

165
00:03:15,180 --> 00:03:16,910
is in P but I don't think you're the
person that falls the majority in all

166
00:03:16,910 --> 00:03:16,920
person that falls the majority in all
 

167
00:03:16,920 --> 00:03:18,770
person that falls the majority in all
walks of life so it's good for that one

168
00:03:18,770 --> 00:03:18,780
walks of life so it's good for that one
 

169
00:03:18,780 --> 00:03:20,330
walks of life so it's good for that one
I do yeah in theoretical computer

170
00:03:20,330 --> 00:03:20,340
I do yeah in theoretical computer
 

171
00:03:20,340 --> 00:03:23,290
I do yeah in theoretical computer
science you you're one of the cheap

172
00:03:23,290 --> 00:03:23,300
science you you're one of the cheap
 

173
00:03:23,300 --> 00:03:27,470
science you you're one of the cheap
all right but do you uh times a useful

174
00:03:27,470 --> 00:03:27,480
all right but do you uh times a useful
 

175
00:03:27,480 --> 00:03:29,690
all right but do you uh times a useful
model sure

176
00:03:29,690 --> 00:03:29,700
model sure
 

177
00:03:29,700 --> 00:03:31,070
model sure
what were you talking about on the

178
00:03:31,070 --> 00:03:31,080
what were you talking about on the
 

179
00:03:31,080 --> 00:03:33,530
what were you talking about on the
stream with time are you made of time if

180
00:03:33,530 --> 00:03:33,540
stream with time are you made of time if
 

181
00:03:33,540 --> 00:03:34,910
stream with time are you made of time if
I remembered half the things I said on

182
00:03:34,910 --> 00:03:34,920
I remembered half the things I said on
 

183
00:03:34,920 --> 00:03:35,710
I remembered half the things I said on
stream

184
00:03:35,710 --> 00:03:35,720
stream
 

185
00:03:35,720 --> 00:03:37,490

someday someone's going to make a model

186
00:03:37,490 --> 00:03:37,500
someday someone's going to make a model
 

187
00:03:37,500 --> 00:03:39,350
someday someone's going to make a model
of all of it I'm just going to come back

188
00:03:39,350 --> 00:03:39,360
of all of it I'm just going to come back
 

189
00:03:39,360 --> 00:03:42,770
of all of it I'm just going to come back
to haunt me someday soon yeah probably

190
00:03:42,770 --> 00:03:42,780
to haunt me someday soon yeah probably
 

191
00:03:42,780 --> 00:03:45,289
to haunt me someday soon yeah probably
would that be exciting to you or sad

192
00:03:45,289 --> 00:03:45,299
would that be exciting to you or sad
 

193
00:03:45,299 --> 00:03:48,050
would that be exciting to you or sad
that there's a George hotz model

194
00:03:48,050 --> 00:03:48,060
that there's a George hotz model
 

195
00:03:48,060 --> 00:03:49,970
that there's a George hotz model
I mean the question is when the George

196
00:03:49,970 --> 00:03:49,980
I mean the question is when the George
 

197
00:03:49,980 --> 00:03:52,250
I mean the question is when the George
Hots model is better than George hotz

198
00:03:52,250 --> 00:03:52,260
Hots model is better than George hotz
 

199
00:03:52,260 --> 00:03:54,289
Hots model is better than George hotz
like I am declining and the model is

200
00:03:54,289 --> 00:03:54,299
like I am declining and the model is
 

201
00:03:54,299 --> 00:03:56,270
like I am declining and the model is
growing what is the metric by which you

202
00:03:56,270 --> 00:03:56,280
growing what is the metric by which you
 

203
00:03:56,280 --> 00:03:57,949
growing what is the metric by which you
measure better or worse in that if

204
00:03:57,949 --> 00:03:57,959
measure better or worse in that if
 

205
00:03:57,959 --> 00:04:00,050
measure better or worse in that if
you're competing with yourself

206
00:04:00,050 --> 00:04:00,060
you're competing with yourself
 

207
00:04:00,060 --> 00:04:02,690
you're competing with yourself
maybe you can just play a game where you

208
00:04:02,690 --> 00:04:02,700
maybe you can just play a game where you
 

209
00:04:02,700 --> 00:04:03,949
maybe you can just play a game where you
have the George hot answer and the

210
00:04:03,949 --> 00:04:03,959
have the George hot answer and the
 

211
00:04:03,959 --> 00:04:05,270
have the George hot answer and the
George hotz model answer and ask which

212
00:04:05,270 --> 00:04:05,280
George hotz model answer and ask which
 

213
00:04:05,280 --> 00:04:06,589
George hotz model answer and ask which
people prefer

214
00:04:06,589 --> 00:04:06,599
people prefer
 

215
00:04:06,599 --> 00:04:09,289
people prefer
people close to you or strangers

00:04:09,289 --> 00:04:09,299
people close to you or strangers
 

217
00:04:09,299 --> 00:04:11,030
people close to you or strangers
either one it will hurt more when it's

218
00:04:11,030 --> 00:04:11,040
either one it will hurt more when it's
 

219
00:04:11,040 --> 00:04:12,890
either one it will hurt more when it's
people close to me but

220
00:04:12,890 --> 00:04:12,900
people close to me but
 

221
00:04:12,900 --> 00:04:14,509
people close to me but
both will be overtaken by the

222
00:04:14,509 --> 00:04:14,519
both will be overtaken by the
 

223
00:04:14,519 --> 00:04:16,030
both will be overtaken by the
georgetown's model

224
00:04:16,030 --> 00:04:16,040
georgetown's model
 

225
00:04:16,040 --> 00:04:18,949
georgetown's model
it'd be quite painful right loved ones

226
00:04:18,949 --> 00:04:18,959
it'd be quite painful right loved ones
 

227
00:04:18,959 --> 00:04:21,349
it'd be quite painful right loved ones
family members would rather have the

228
00:04:21,349 --> 00:04:21,359
family members would rather have the
 

229
00:04:21,359 --> 00:04:23,330
family members would rather have the
model over for Thanksgiving than you

230
00:04:23,330 --> 00:04:23,340
model over for Thanksgiving than you
 

231
00:04:23,340 --> 00:04:24,650
model over for Thanksgiving than you
yeah

232
00:04:24,650 --> 00:04:24,660
yeah
 

233
00:04:24,660 --> 00:04:27,170
yeah
or like significant others

234
00:04:27,170 --> 00:04:27,180
or like significant others
 

235
00:04:27,180 --> 00:04:30,969
or like significant others
would rather sext

237
00:04:30,979 --> 00:04:33,409

with the uh with the large language

238
00:04:33,409 --> 00:04:33,419
with the uh with the large language
 

239
00:04:33,419 --> 00:04:35,390
with the uh with the large language
model version of you

240
00:04:35,390 --> 00:04:35,400
model version of you
 

241
00:04:35,400 --> 00:04:37,070
model version of you
especially when it's fine-tuned to their

00:04:37,070 --> 00:04:37,080
especially when it's fine-tuned to their
 

243
00:04:37,080 --> 00:04:38,270

yeah

246
00:04:40,310 --> 00:04:40,320
yeah
 

247
00:04:40,320 --> 00:04:41,990
yeah
well that's what we're doing in a

248
00:04:41,990 --> 00:04:42,000
well that's what we're doing in a
 

249
00:04:42,000 --> 00:04:42,950
well that's what we're doing in a
relationship right we're just

250
00:04:42,950 --> 00:04:42,960
relationship right we're just
 

251
00:04:42,960 --> 00:04:44,030
relationship right we're just
fine-tuning ourselves but we're

252
00:04:44,030 --> 00:04:44,040
fine-tuning ourselves but we're
 

253
00:04:44,040 --> 00:04:45,530
fine-tuning ourselves but we're
inefficient with it because we're

254
00:04:45,530 --> 00:04:45,540
inefficient with it because we're
 

255
00:04:45,540 --> 00:04:47,510
inefficient with it because we're
selfish ingredients and so on our

00:04:47,510 --> 00:04:47,520
selfish ingredients and so on our
 

257
00:04:47,520 --> 00:04:49,969
selfish ingredients and so on our
language models can fine tune more

258
00:04:49,969 --> 00:04:49,979
language models can fine tune more
 

259
00:04:49,979 --> 00:04:52,189
language models can fine tune more
efficiently more selflessly there's a

260
00:04:52,189 --> 00:04:52,199
efficiently more selflessly there's a
 

261
00:04:52,199 --> 00:04:54,110
efficiently more selflessly there's a
Star Trek Voyager episode where uh you

262
00:04:54,110 --> 00:04:54,120
Star Trek Voyager episode where uh you
 

263
00:04:54,120 --> 00:04:55,430
Star Trek Voyager episode where uh you
know Catherine Janeway

264
00:04:55,430 --> 00:04:55,440
know Catherine Janeway
 

265
00:04:55,440 --> 00:04:57,830
know Catherine Janeway

a lover on the Holodeck and

268
00:05:00,880 --> 00:05:00,890
a lover on the Holodeck and

00:05:01,249 --> 00:05:01,259
[Music]
 

271
00:05:01,259 --> 00:05:02,749
[Music]
um

272
00:05:02,749 --> 00:05:02,759
um
 

273
00:05:02,759 --> 00:05:05,090
um
the lover falls asleep on her arm and he

274
00:05:05,090 --> 00:05:05,100
the lover falls asleep on her arm and he
 

275
00:05:05,100 --> 00:05:06,830
the lover falls asleep on her arm and he
snores a little bit and you know Janeway

276
00:05:06,830 --> 00:05:06,840
snores a little bit and you know Janeway
 

277
00:05:06,840 --> 00:05:08,689
snores a little bit and you know Janeway
edits the program to remove that

278
00:05:08,689 --> 00:05:08,699
edits the program to remove that
 

279
00:05:08,699 --> 00:05:10,310
edits the program to remove that
and then of course the realization is

280
00:05:10,310 --> 00:05:10,320
and then of course the realization is
 

281
00:05:10,320 --> 00:05:12,770
and then of course the realization is
wait this person's terrible it is

282
00:05:12,770 --> 00:05:12,780
wait this person's terrible it is
 

283
00:05:12,780 --> 00:05:15,110
wait this person's terrible it is
actually all there uh

284
00:05:15,110 --> 00:05:15,120
actually all there uh
 

285
00:05:15,120 --> 00:05:17,330
actually all there uh
nuances and quirks and slight annoyances

286
00:05:17,330 --> 00:05:17,340
nuances and quirks and slight annoyances
 

287
00:05:17,340 --> 00:05:18,650
nuances and quirks and slight annoyances
that that make this relationship

288
00:05:18,650 --> 00:05:18,660
that that make this relationship
 

289
00:05:18,660 --> 00:05:19,909
that that make this relationship
worthwhile

290
00:05:19,909 --> 00:05:19,919
worthwhile
 

291
00:05:19,919 --> 00:05:21,890
worthwhile
but I don't think we're going to realize

292
00:05:21,890 --> 00:05:21,900
but I don't think we're going to realize
 

293
00:05:21,900 --> 00:05:24,110
but I don't think we're going to realize
that until it's too late

294
00:05:24,110 --> 00:05:24,120
that until it's too late
 

295
00:05:24,120 --> 00:05:26,570
that until it's too late
well I think a large language model

296
00:05:26,570 --> 00:05:26,580
well I think a large language model
 

297
00:05:26,580 --> 00:05:29,570
well I think a large language model
could incorporate the the flaws and the

298
00:05:29,570 --> 00:05:29,580
could incorporate the the flaws and the
 

299
00:05:29,580 --> 00:05:31,070
could incorporate the the flaws and the
quarks and all that kind of stuff just

300
00:05:31,070 --> 00:05:31,080
quarks and all that kind of stuff just
 

301
00:05:31,080 --> 00:05:33,230
quarks and all that kind of stuff just
the perfect amount of quirks and floor

302
00:05:33,230 --> 00:05:33,240
the perfect amount of quirks and floor
 

303
00:05:33,240 --> 00:05:35,150
the perfect amount of quirks and floor
flaws to make you charming without

304
00:05:35,150 --> 00:05:35,160
flaws to make you charming without
 

305
00:05:35,160 --> 00:05:38,390
flaws to make you charming without
crossing the line yeah yeah and there's

306
00:05:38,390 --> 00:05:38,400
crossing the line yeah yeah and there's
 

307
00:05:38,400 --> 00:05:40,510
crossing the line yeah yeah and there's
probably a good like

308
00:05:40,510 --> 00:05:40,520
probably a good like
 

309
00:05:40,520 --> 00:05:43,070
probably a good like
approximation of the like the percent of

310
00:05:43,070 --> 00:05:43,080
approximation of the like the percent of
 

311
00:05:43,080 --> 00:05:46,070
approximation of the like the percent of
time the language model should be uh

312
00:05:46,070 --> 00:05:46,080
time the language model should be uh
 

313
00:05:46,080 --> 00:05:48,110
time the language model should be uh
cranky or uh

314
00:05:48,110 --> 00:05:48,120
cranky or uh
 

315
00:05:48,120 --> 00:05:51,590
cranky or uh
an [\h__\h] or jealous or all this kind

316
00:05:51,590 --> 00:05:51,600
an [\h__\h] or jealous or all this kind
 

317
00:05:51,600 --> 00:05:53,090
an [\h__\h] or jealous or all this kind
of stuff and of course it can and it

318
00:05:53,090 --> 00:05:53,100
of stuff and of course it can and it
 

319
00:05:53,100 --> 00:05:55,129
of stuff and of course it can and it
will but all that difficulty at that

320
00:05:55,129 --> 00:05:55,139
will but all that difficulty at that
 

321
00:05:55,139 --> 00:05:57,290
will but all that difficulty at that
point is artificial there's no more real

322
00:05:57,290 --> 00:05:57,300
point is artificial there's no more real
 

323
00:05:57,300 --> 00:05:58,670
point is artificial there's no more real
difficulty

324
00:05:58,670 --> 00:05:58,680
difficulty
 

325
00:05:58,680 --> 00:06:00,350

okay what's the difference in real and

326
00:06:00,350 --> 00:06:00,360
okay what's the difference in real and
 

327
00:06:00,360 --> 00:06:02,810
okay what's the difference in real and
artificial artificial difficulty is

00:06:02,810 --> 00:06:02,820
artificial artificial difficulty is
 

329
00:06:02,820 --> 00:06:04,670
artificial artificial difficulty is
difficulty that's like constructed or

330
00:06:04,670 --> 00:06:04,680
difficulty that's like constructed or
 

331
00:06:04,680 --> 00:06:06,710
difficulty that's like constructed or
could be turned off with a knob real

332
00:06:06,710 --> 00:06:06,720
could be turned off with a knob real
 

333
00:06:06,720 --> 00:06:08,510
could be turned off with a knob real
difficulty is like you're in the woods

334
00:06:08,510 --> 00:06:08,520
difficulty is like you're in the woods
 

335
00:06:08,520 --> 00:06:10,370
difficulty is like you're in the woods
and you've got to survive

336
00:06:10,370 --> 00:06:10,380
and you've got to survive
 

337
00:06:10,380 --> 00:06:13,610
and you've got to survive
so if something cannot be turned off

338
00:06:13,610 --> 00:06:13,620
so if something cannot be turned off
 

339
00:06:13,620 --> 00:06:15,950
so if something cannot be turned off
with a knob it's real

340
00:06:15,950 --> 00:06:15,960
with a knob it's real
 

341
00:06:15,960 --> 00:06:19,430
with a knob it's real
yeah I think so or I mean you can't get

342
00:06:19,430 --> 00:06:19,440
yeah I think so or I mean you can't get
 

343
00:06:19,440 --> 00:06:21,050
yeah I think so or I mean you can't get
out of this by Smashing the knob with a

344
00:06:21,050 --> 00:06:21,060
out of this by Smashing the knob with a
 

345
00:06:21,060 --> 00:06:21,890
out of this by Smashing the knob with a
hammer

346

hammer
 

347
00:06:21,900 --> 00:06:23,990

I mean maybe you kind of can you know I

348
00:06:23,990 --> 00:06:24,000
I mean maybe you kind of can you know I
 

349
00:06:24,000 --> 00:06:27,249
I mean maybe you kind of can you know I

before but it's the 90s everything's
 

357
00:06:33,060 --> 00:06:34,430
before but it's the 90s everything's
been explored so he's like well I'm just

358
00:06:34,430 --> 00:06:34,440
been explored so he's like well I'm just
 

359
00:06:34,440 --> 00:06:35,749
been explored so he's like well I'm just
not going to bring a map

360
00:06:35,749 --> 00:06:35,759
not going to bring a map
 

361
00:06:35,759 --> 00:06:38,210
not going to bring a map
yeah I mean

362
00:06:38,210 --> 00:06:38,220
yeah I mean
 

363
00:06:38,220 --> 00:06:40,309
yeah I mean
no you're you're not exploring you

364
00:06:40,309 --> 00:06:40,319
no you're you're not exploring you
 

365
00:06:40,319 --> 00:06:41,570
no you're you're not exploring you
should have brought a map dude you died

366
00:06:41,570 --> 00:06:41,580
should have brought a map dude you died

00:06:58,979 --> 00:07:01,129
you feel before you started what if we
just don't have access to the knob well

just don't have access to the knob well

00:11:53,810 --> 00:11:53,820
let you watch the tape again and you'll
 

649
00:11:53,820 --> 00:11:56,150
let you watch the tape again and you'll
do it uh so we're actually going to

650
00:11:56,150 --> 00:11:56,160
do it uh so we're actually going to
 

651
00:11:56,160 --> 00:11:57,889
do it uh so we're actually going to
build that I think but it's not going to

652
00:11:57,889 --> 00:11:57,899
build that I think but it's not going to
 

653
00:11:57,899 --> 00:11:59,630
build that I think but it's not going to
be one static tape I think the human

654
00:11:59,630 --> 00:11:59,640
be one static tape I think the human
 

655
00:11:59,640 --> 00:12:03,110
be one static tape I think the human
brain is too complex to be

656
00:12:03,110 --> 00:12:03,120
brain is too complex to be
 

657
00:12:03,120 --> 00:12:05,329
brain is too complex to be
stuck in one static tape like that if

658
00:12:05,329 --> 00:12:05,339
stuck in one static tape like that if
 

659
00:12:05,339 --> 00:12:06,829
stuck in one static tape like that if
you look at like ant Brands maybe they

660
00:12:06,829 --> 00:12:06,839
you look at like ant Brands maybe they
 

661
00:12:06,839 --> 00:12:08,810
you look at like ant Brands maybe they
can be stuck on a static tape

662
00:12:08,810 --> 00:12:08,820
can be stuck on a static tape
 

663
00:12:08,820 --> 00:12:10,490
can be stuck on a static tape
but we're going to build that using

664
00:12:10,490 --> 00:12:10,500
but we're going to build that using
 

665
00:12:10,500 --> 00:12:11,990
but we're going to build that using
generative models we're going to build

666
00:12:11,990 --> 00:12:12,000
generative models we're going to build
 

667
00:12:12,000 --> 00:12:13,430
generative models we're going to build
the tick tock that you actually can't

668
00:12:13,430 --> 00:12:13,440
the tick tock that you actually can't
 

669
00:12:13,440 --> 00:12:15,290
the tick tock that you actually can't
look away from

670
00:12:15,290 --> 00:12:15,300
look away from
 

671
00:12:15,300 --> 00:12:16,850
look away from
so Tick Tock is already pretty close

672
00:12:16,850 --> 00:12:16,860
so Tick Tock is already pretty close
 

673
00:12:16,860 --> 00:12:18,350
so Tick Tock is already pretty close
there but the generation is done by

674
00:12:18,350 --> 00:12:18,360
there but the generation is done by
 

675
00:12:18,360 --> 00:12:20,630
there but the generation is done by
humans the algorithm is just doing their

676
00:12:20,630 --> 00:12:20,640
humans the algorithm is just doing their
 

677
00:12:20,640 --> 00:12:22,550
humans the algorithm is just doing their
recommendation but if this do if the

678
00:12:22,550 --> 00:12:22,560
recommendation but if this do if the
 

679
00:12:22,560 --> 00:12:23,810
recommendation but if this do if the
algorithm is also able to do the

680
00:12:23,810 --> 00:12:23,820
algorithm is also able to do the
 

681
00:12:23,820 --> 00:12:25,130
algorithm is also able to do the
generation

682
00:12:25,130 --> 00:12:25,140
generation
 

683
00:12:25,140 --> 00:12:26,810
generation
well it's a question about how much

684
00:12:26,810 --> 00:12:26,820
well it's a question about how much
 

685
00:12:26,820 --> 00:12:29,449
well it's a question about how much
intelligence is behind it right so the

686
00:12:29,449 --> 00:12:29,459
intelligence is behind it right so the
 

687
00:12:29,459 --> 00:12:31,130
intelligence is behind it right so the
content is being generated by let's say

688
00:12:31,130 --> 00:12:31,140
content is being generated by let's say
 

689
00:12:31,140 --> 00:12:33,170
content is being generated by let's say
one Humanity worth of intelligence and

690
00:12:33,170 --> 00:12:33,180
one Humanity worth of intelligence and
 

691
00:12:33,180 --> 00:12:35,030
one Humanity worth of intelligence and
you can quantify a Humanity right that's

692
00:12:35,030 --> 00:12:35,040
you can quantify a Humanity right that's
 

693
00:12:35,040 --> 00:12:37,690
you can quantify a Humanity right that's
a you know it's it's

694
00:12:37,690 --> 00:12:37,700
a you know it's it's
 

695
00:12:37,700 --> 00:12:40,910
a you know it's it's
a flops yada flops uh but you can

696
00:12:40,910 --> 00:12:40,920
a flops yada flops uh but you can
 

697
00:12:40,920 --> 00:12:43,129
a flops yada flops uh but you can
quantify it once that generation is

698
00:12:43,129 --> 00:12:43,139
quantify it once that generation is
 

699
00:12:43,139 --> 00:12:44,569
quantify it once that generation is
being done by a hundred Humanities

700
00:12:44,569 --> 00:12:44,579
being done by a hundred Humanities
 

701
00:12:44,579 --> 00:12:47,690
being done by a hundred Humanities
you're done

702
00:12:47,690 --> 00:12:47,700

 

703
00:12:47,700 --> 00:12:49,370

so let's actually scale that's the

704
00:12:49,370 --> 00:12:49,380
so let's actually scale that's the
 

705
00:12:49,380 --> 00:12:50,629
so let's actually scale that's the
problem

706
00:12:50,629 --> 00:12:50,639
problem
 

707
00:12:50,639 --> 00:12:53,650
problem
but also speed

708
00:12:53,650 --> 00:12:53,660
but also speed
 

709
00:12:53,660 --> 00:12:57,110
but also speed
yeah and what if it's sort of

710
00:12:57,110 --> 00:12:57,120
yeah and what if it's sort of
 

711
00:12:57,120 --> 00:12:58,490
yeah and what if it's sort of
manipulating

712
00:12:58,490 --> 00:12:58,500
manipulating
 

713
00:12:58,500 --> 00:13:01,389
manipulating
the very limited human dopamine engine

714
00:13:01,389 --> 00:13:01,399
the very limited human dopamine engine
 

715
00:13:01,399 --> 00:13:04,910
the very limited human dopamine engine
for porn imagine just Tick Tock but for

716
00:13:04,910 --> 00:13:04,920
for porn imagine just Tick Tock but for
 

717
00:13:04,920 --> 00:13:08,389
for porn imagine just Tick Tock but for
porn yeah it's like a Brave New World

718
00:13:08,389 --> 00:13:08,399
porn yeah it's like a Brave New World
 

719
00:13:08,399 --> 00:13:10,009
porn yeah it's like a Brave New World
I don't even know what it'll look like

720
00:13:10,009 --> 00:13:10,019
I don't even know what it'll look like
 

721
00:13:10,019 --> 00:13:12,590
I don't even know what it'll look like
right like again you can't imagine the

722
00:13:12,590 --> 00:13:12,600
right like again you can't imagine the
 

723
00:13:12,600 --> 00:13:14,210
right like again you can't imagine the
behaviors of something smarter than you

724
00:13:14,210 --> 00:13:14,220
behaviors of something smarter than you
 

725
00:13:14,220 --> 00:13:18,710
behaviors of something smarter than you
but a super intelligent and and an agent

726
00:13:18,710 --> 00:13:18,720
but a super intelligent and and an agent
 

727
00:13:18,720 --> 00:13:20,810
but a super intelligent and and an agent
that just dominates your intelligence so

728
00:13:20,810 --> 00:13:20,820
that just dominates your intelligence so
 

729
00:13:20,820 --> 00:13:22,970
that just dominates your intelligence so
much will be able to completely

730
00:13:22,970 --> 00:13:22,980
much will be able to completely
 

731
00:13:22,980 --> 00:13:26,090
much will be able to completely
manipulate you is it possible that it

732
00:13:26,090 --> 00:13:26,100
manipulate you is it possible that it
 

733
00:13:26,100 --> 00:13:27,590
manipulate you is it possible that it
won't really manipulate it'll just move

734
00:13:27,590 --> 00:13:27,600
won't really manipulate it'll just move
 

735
00:13:27,600 --> 00:13:31,250
won't really manipulate it'll just move
past us it'll just kind of exist the way

736
00:13:31,250 --> 00:13:31,260
past us it'll just kind of exist the way
 

737
00:13:31,260 --> 00:13:34,129
past us it'll just kind of exist the way
water exists or the air exists you see

738
00:13:34,129 --> 00:13:34,139
water exists or the air exists you see
 

739
00:13:34,139 --> 00:13:37,610
water exists or the air exists you see
and that's the whole AI safety thing

740
00:13:37,610 --> 00:13:37,620
and that's the whole AI safety thing
 

741
00:13:37,620 --> 00:13:39,829
and that's the whole AI safety thing
it's not the machine that's going to do

742
00:13:39,829 --> 00:13:39,839
it's not the machine that's going to do
 

743
00:13:39,839 --> 00:13:41,690
it's not the machine that's going to do
that it's other humans using the machine

744
00:13:41,690 --> 00:13:41,700
that it's other humans using the machine
 

745
00:13:41,700 --> 00:13:43,730
that it's other humans using the machine
that are going to do that to you yeah

746
00:13:43,730 --> 00:13:43,740
that are going to do that to you yeah
 

747
00:13:43,740 --> 00:13:45,710
that are going to do that to you yeah
because the machine is not interested in

748
00:13:45,710 --> 00:13:45,720
because the machine is not interested in
 

749
00:13:45,720 --> 00:13:47,930
because the machine is not interested in
hurting humans it's just the machine is

750
00:13:47,930 --> 00:13:47,940
hurting humans it's just the machine is
 

751
00:13:47,940 --> 00:13:50,269
hurting humans it's just the machine is
a machine yeah but the human gets the

752
00:13:50,269 --> 00:13:50,279
a machine yeah but the human gets the
 

753
00:13:50,279 --> 00:13:51,889
a machine yeah but the human gets the
machine and there's a lot of humans out

754
00:13:51,889 --> 00:13:51,899
machine and there's a lot of humans out
 

755
00:13:51,899 --> 00:13:53,449
machine and there's a lot of humans out
there very interested in manipulating

756
00:13:53,449 --> 00:13:53,459
there very interested in manipulating
 

757
00:13:53,459 --> 00:13:54,829
there very interested in manipulating
you

758
00:13:54,829 --> 00:13:54,839
you
 

759
00:13:54,839 --> 00:13:59,329
you
well let me bring up elieza yadkowski

760
00:13:59,329 --> 00:13:59,339
well let me bring up elieza yadkowski
 

761
00:13:59,339 --> 00:14:02,569
well let me bring up elieza yadkowski
who recently sat where you're sitting he

762
00:14:02,569 --> 00:14:02,579
who recently sat where you're sitting he
 

763
00:14:02,579 --> 00:14:05,150
who recently sat where you're sitting he
thinks that AI will almost surely kill

764
00:14:05,150 --> 00:14:05,160
thinks that AI will almost surely kill
 

765
00:14:05,160 --> 00:14:06,650
thinks that AI will almost surely kill
everyone

766
00:14:06,650 --> 00:14:06,660
everyone
 

767
00:14:06,660 --> 00:14:09,650
everyone
do you agree with him or not

768
00:14:09,650 --> 00:14:09,660
do you agree with him or not
 

769
00:14:09,660 --> 00:14:12,290
do you agree with him or not
yes but maybe for a different reason

770
00:14:12,290 --> 00:14:12,300
yes but maybe for a different reason
 

771
00:14:12,300 --> 00:14:13,810
yes but maybe for a different reason
okay

772
00:14:13,810 --> 00:14:13,820
okay
 

773
00:14:13,820 --> 00:14:18,050
okay
and then I'll try to uh get you to find

774
00:14:18,050 --> 00:14:18,060
and then I'll try to uh get you to find
 

775
00:14:18,060 --> 00:14:21,110
and then I'll try to uh get you to find
Hope or we could find a node to that

776
00:14:21,110 --> 00:14:21,120
Hope or we could find a node to that
 

777
00:14:21,120 --> 00:14:23,389
Hope or we could find a node to that
answer but why yes

778
00:14:23,389 --> 00:14:23,399
answer but why yes
 

779
00:14:23,399 --> 00:14:25,430
answer but why yes
okay why didn't nuclear weapons kill

780
00:14:25,430 --> 00:14:25,440
okay why didn't nuclear weapons kill
 

781
00:14:25,440 --> 00:14:27,710
okay why didn't nuclear weapons kill
everyone that's a good question I think

782
00:14:27,710 --> 00:14:27,720
everyone that's a good question I think
 

783
00:14:27,720 --> 00:14:29,030
everyone that's a good question I think
there's an answer I think it's actually

784
00:14:29,030 --> 00:14:29,040
there's an answer I think it's actually
 

785
00:14:29,040 --> 00:14:30,410
there's an answer I think it's actually
very hard to deploy nuclear weapons

786
00:14:30,410 --> 00:14:30,420
very hard to deploy nuclear weapons
 

787
00:14:30,420 --> 00:14:31,990
very hard to deploy nuclear weapons
tactically

788
00:14:31,990 --> 00:14:32,000
tactically
 

789
00:14:32,000 --> 00:14:34,610
tactically
it's very hard to accomplish tactical

790
00:14:34,610 --> 00:14:34,620
it's very hard to accomplish tactical
 

791
00:14:34,620 --> 00:14:36,350
it's very hard to accomplish tactical
objectives great I can nuke their

792
00:14:36,350 --> 00:14:36,360
objectives great I can nuke their
 

793
00:14:36,360 --> 00:14:38,569
objectives great I can nuke their
country I have an irradiated pile of

794
00:14:38,569 --> 00:14:38,579
country I have an irradiated pile of
 

795
00:14:38,579 --> 00:14:41,150
country I have an irradiated pile of
rubble I don't want that why not why

796
00:14:41,150 --> 00:14:41,160
rubble I don't want that why not why
 

797
00:14:41,160 --> 00:14:42,470
rubble I don't want that why not why
don't I want an irradiated pile of

798
00:14:42,470 --> 00:14:42,480
don't I want an irradiated pile of
 

799
00:14:42,480 --> 00:14:44,329
don't I want an irradiated pile of
rubble yeah for all the reasons no one

800
00:14:44,329 --> 00:14:44,339
rubble yeah for all the reasons no one
 

801
00:14:44,339 --> 00:14:45,889
rubble yeah for all the reasons no one
wants in a radiated pile of rubble

802
00:14:45,889 --> 00:14:45,899
wants in a radiated pile of rubble
 

803
00:14:45,899 --> 00:14:49,490
wants in a radiated pile of rubble
because you can't use that land for uh

804
00:14:49,490 --> 00:14:49,500
because you can't use that land for uh

help uh gain a military Advantage it's
 

823
00:15:13,920 --> 00:15:16,370
help uh gain a military Advantage it's
all complete destruction all right yeah

the interesting thing about humanity is
 

873
00:16:16,920 --> 00:16:19,250
the interesting thing about humanity is
the diversity oh yeah organisms in

874
00:16:19,250 --> 00:16:19,260
the diversity oh yeah organisms in
 

875
00:16:19,260 --> 00:16:21,170
the diversity oh yeah organisms in
general there's a lot of weirdos out

yeah no it's the interconnectedness
 

907
00:16:51,240 --> 00:16:54,230
yeah no it's the interconnectedness
that's that's that's that's doing it oh

that's that's that's that's doing it oh
 

909
00:16:54,240 --> 00:16:56,810
that's that's that's that's doing it oh
that's interesting so everybody starts

910
00:16:56,810 --> 00:16:56,820
that's interesting so everybody starts
 

911
00:16:56,820 --> 00:16:59,090
that's interesting so everybody starts
relying on the connectivity of the

912
00:16:59,090 --> 00:16:59,100
relying on the connectivity of the
 

913
00:16:59,100 --> 00:17:00,230

internet
 

915
00:17:00,240 --> 00:17:02,449
internet
and over time that reduces the diversity

916
00:17:02,449 --> 00:17:02,459
and over time that reduces the diversity
 

917
00:17:02,459 --> 00:17:04,789
and over time that reduces the diversity
the intellectual diversity and then that

918
00:17:04,789 --> 00:17:04,799
the intellectual diversity and then that
 

919
00:17:04,799 --> 00:17:06,770
the intellectual diversity and then that
gets you everybody into a funnel there's

920
00:17:06,770 --> 00:17:06,780
gets you everybody into a funnel there's
 

921
00:17:06,780 --> 00:17:08,750
gets you everybody into a funnel there's
still going to be a guy in Texas there

Fair do I think AI kills us all uh I

926
00:17:14,090 --> 00:17:14,100
Fair do I think AI kills us all uh I
 

927
00:17:14,100 --> 00:17:16,010
Fair do I think AI kills us all uh I
think AI kills everything we call like

928
00:17:16,010 --> 00:17:16,020
think AI kills everything we call like
 

929
00:17:16,020 --> 00:17:18,470

society today I do not think it actually

930
00:17:18,470 --> 00:17:18,480
society today I do not think it actually
 

931
00:17:18,480 --> 00:17:20,150
society today I do not think it actually
kills the human species I think that's

932
00:17:20,150 --> 00:17:20,160
kills the human species I think that's
 

933
00:17:20,160 --> 00:17:22,789
kills the human species I think that's
actually incredibly hard to do

934
00:17:22,789 --> 00:17:22,799
actually incredibly hard to do
 

935
00:17:22,799 --> 00:17:25,309
actually incredibly hard to do
you have a society like if we start over

936
00:17:25,309 --> 00:17:25,319
you have a society like if we start over
 

937
00:17:25,319 --> 00:17:27,289
you have a society like if we start over
that's tricky most of us don't know how

938
00:17:27,289 --> 00:17:27,299
that's tricky most of us don't know how
 

939
00:17:27,299 --> 00:17:29,930
that's tricky most of us don't know how
to do most things yeah but some of us do

940
00:17:29,930 --> 00:17:29,940
to do most things yeah but some of us do
 

941
00:17:29,940 --> 00:17:32,630

00:17:32,630 --> 00:17:32,640
and they'll be okay and they'll rebuild
 

943
00:17:32,640 --> 00:17:34,010
and they'll be okay and they'll rebuild
after they uh

what's rebuilding look like how far like

948
00:17:38,810 --> 00:17:38,820
what's rebuilding look like how far like
 

949
00:17:38,820 --> 00:17:42,230
what's rebuilding look like how far like
how much do we lose like what is human

950
00:17:42,230 --> 00:17:42,240
how much do we lose like what is human
 

951
00:17:42,240 --> 00:17:43,730
how much do we lose like what is human
civilization done

that's interesting combustion engine

954
00:17:45,830 --> 00:17:45,840
that's interesting combustion engine
 

955
00:17:45,840 --> 00:17:47,750
that's interesting combustion engine
electricity

956
00:17:47,750 --> 00:17:47,760
electricity
 

957
00:17:47,760 --> 00:17:49,430
electricity
so uh

958
00:17:49,430 --> 00:17:49,440
so uh
 

959
00:17:49,440 --> 00:17:52,130
so uh
power and energy that's interesting

960
00:17:52,130 --> 00:17:52,140
power and energy that's interesting
 

961
00:17:52,140 --> 00:17:54,230
power and energy that's interesting
like how to harness energy

962
00:17:54,230 --> 00:17:54,240
like how to harness energy
 

963
00:17:54,240 --> 00:17:56,090
like how to harness energy
well they're going to be religiously

964
00:17:56,090 --> 00:17:56,100
well they're going to be religiously
 

965
00:17:56,100 --> 00:17:58,370
well they're going to be religiously
against that

966
00:17:58,370 --> 00:17:58,380
against that
 

967
00:17:58,380 --> 00:18:00,590
against that
are they going to get back to uh like

968
00:18:00,590 --> 00:18:00,600
are they going to get back to uh like
 

969
00:18:00,600 --> 00:18:01,909
are they going to get back to uh like
fire

970
00:18:01,909 --> 00:18:01,919
fire
 

971
00:18:01,919 --> 00:18:04,010
fire
sure I mean they'll be a they'll be

972
00:18:04,010 --> 00:18:04,020
sure I mean they'll be a they'll be
 

973
00:18:04,020 --> 00:18:05,810
sure I mean they'll be a they'll be
it'll be like you know some kind of

974
00:18:05,810 --> 00:18:05,820
it'll be like you know some kind of
 

975
00:18:05,820 --> 00:18:07,669
it'll be like you know some kind of
Amish looking kind of thing I think I

976
00:18:07,669 --> 00:18:07,679
Amish looking kind of thing I think I
 

977
00:18:07,679 --> 00:18:08,750
Amish looking kind of thing I think I
think they're going to have very strong

978
00:18:08,750 --> 00:18:08,760
think they're going to have very strong
 

979
00:18:08,760 --> 00:18:12,650
think they're going to have very strong
taboos against technology

980
00:18:12,650 --> 00:18:12,660
taboos against technology
 

981
00:18:12,660 --> 00:18:14,570
taboos against technology
like technology is almost like a new

982
00:18:14,570 --> 00:18:14,580
like technology is almost like a new
 

983
00:18:14,580 --> 00:18:16,310
like technology is almost like a new
religion technology is the devil yeah

984
00:18:16,310 --> 00:18:16,320
religion technology is the devil yeah
 

985
00:18:16,320 --> 00:18:20,210
religion technology is the devil yeah
and uh nature is God

986
00:18:20,210 --> 00:18:20,220
and uh nature is God
 

987
00:18:20,220 --> 00:18:22,549
and uh nature is God
sure to closer to nature but can you

988
00:18:22,549 --> 00:18:22,559
sure to closer to nature but can you
 

989
00:18:22,559 --> 00:18:24,830
sure to closer to nature but can you
really get away from AI if it destroyed

990
00:18:24,830 --> 00:18:24,840
really get away from AI if it destroyed
 

991
00:18:24,840 --> 00:18:28,130
really get away from AI if it destroyed
99 of the human species isn't it somehow

992
00:18:28,130 --> 00:18:28,140
99 of the human species isn't it somehow
 

993
00:18:28,140 --> 00:18:30,650
99 of the human species isn't it somehow
have a whole like a stronghold

994
00:18:30,650 --> 00:18:30,660
have a whole like a stronghold
 

995
00:18:30,660 --> 00:18:32,630
have a whole like a stronghold
what's interesting about

996
00:18:32,630 --> 00:18:32,640
what's interesting about
 

997
00:18:32,640 --> 00:18:34,610
what's interesting about
everything we build I think we're going

998
00:18:34,610 --> 00:18:34,620
everything we build I think we're going
 

999
00:18:34,620 --> 00:18:36,470
everything we build I think we're going
to build super intelligence before we

1000
00:18:36,470 --> 00:18:36,480
to build super intelligence before we
 

1001
00:18:36,480 --> 00:18:39,350
to build super intelligence before we
build any sort of robustness in the AI

1002
00:18:39,350 --> 00:18:39,360
build any sort of robustness in the AI
 

1003
00:18:39,360 --> 00:18:42,049
build any sort of robustness in the AI
we cannot build an AI that is capable of

1004
00:18:42,049 --> 00:18:42,059
we cannot build an AI that is capable of
 

1005
00:18:42,059 --> 00:18:44,570
we cannot build an AI that is capable of
going out into nature and surviving like

1006
00:18:44,570 --> 00:18:44,580
going out into nature and surviving like
 

1007
00:18:44,580 --> 00:18:46,669
going out into nature and surviving like
a um like a bird

1008
00:18:46,669 --> 00:18:46,679
a um like a bird
 

1009
00:18:46,679 --> 00:18:49,630
a um like a bird
right a bird is an incredibly robust

1010
00:18:49,630 --> 00:18:49,640
right a bird is an incredibly robust
 

1011
00:18:49,640 --> 00:18:51,710
right a bird is an incredibly robust
organism we've built nothing like this

1012
00:18:51,710 --> 00:18:51,720
organism we've built nothing like this
 

1013
00:18:51,720 --> 00:18:53,090
organism we've built nothing like this
we haven't built a machine that's

1014
00:18:53,090 --> 00:18:53,100
we haven't built a machine that's
 

1015
00:18:53,100 --> 00:18:54,830
we haven't built a machine that's
capable of reproducing

1016
00:18:54,830 --> 00:18:54,840
capable of reproducing
 

1017
00:18:54,840 --> 00:18:57,070
capable of reproducing
yes but

1018
00:18:57,070 --> 00:18:57,080
yes but
 

1019
00:18:57,080 --> 00:18:59,330
yes but
there's uh you know I work with Lego

1020
00:18:59,330 --> 00:18:59,340
there's uh you know I work with Lego
 

1021
00:18:59,340 --> 00:19:01,909
there's uh you know I work with Lego
robots a lot now I have a bunch of them

1022
00:19:01,909 --> 00:19:01,919
robots a lot now I have a bunch of them
 

1023
00:19:01,919 --> 00:19:02,810
robots a lot now I have a bunch of them
um

1024
00:19:02,810 --> 00:19:02,820
um
 

1025
00:19:02,820 --> 00:19:04,450
um
they're mobile

1026
00:19:04,450 --> 00:19:04,460
they're mobile
 

1027
00:19:04,460 --> 00:19:07,730
they're mobile
they can't reproduce but all they need

1028
00:19:07,730 --> 00:19:07,740
they can't reproduce but all they need
 

1029
00:19:07,740 --> 00:19:09,409
they can't reproduce but all they need
is I guess you're saying they can't

1030
00:19:09,409 --> 00:19:09,419
is I guess you're saying they can't
 

1031
00:19:09,419 --> 00:19:11,150
is I guess you're saying they can't
repair themselves but if you have a

1032
00:19:11,150 --> 00:19:11,160
repair themselves but if you have a
 

1033
00:19:11,160 --> 00:19:12,169
repair themselves but if you have a
large number if you have like 100

1034
00:19:12,169 --> 00:19:12,179
large number if you have like 100
 

1035
00:19:12,179 --> 00:19:14,150
large number if you have like 100
million of them let's just focus on them

1036
00:19:14,150 --> 00:19:14,160
million of them let's just focus on them
 

1037
00:19:14,160 --> 00:19:16,130
million of them let's just focus on them
reproducing right they have microchips

1038
00:19:16,130 --> 00:19:16,140
reproducing right they have microchips
 

1039
00:19:16,140 --> 00:19:20,090
reproducing right they have microchips
in them okay then do they include a Fab

1040
00:19:20,090 --> 00:19:20,100
in them okay then do they include a Fab
 

1041
00:19:20,100 --> 00:19:22,250
in them okay then do they include a Fab
no then how are they going to reproduce

1042
00:19:22,250 --> 00:19:22,260
no then how are they going to reproduce
 

1043
00:19:22,260 --> 00:19:25,070
no then how are they going to reproduce
well they're they it doesn't have to be

1044
00:19:25,070 --> 00:19:25,080
well they're they it doesn't have to be
 

1045
00:19:25,080 --> 00:19:28,010
well they're they it doesn't have to be
all on board right they can go to a

1046
00:19:28,010 --> 00:19:28,020
all on board right they can go to a
 

1047
00:19:28,020 --> 00:19:30,409
all on board right they can go to a
factory to a repair shop yeah but then

1048
00:19:30,409 --> 00:19:30,419
factory to a repair shop yeah but then
 

1049
00:19:30,419 --> 00:19:32,090
factory to a repair shop yeah but then
you're really moving away from

1050
00:19:32,090 --> 00:19:32,100
you're really moving away from
 

1051
00:19:32,100 --> 00:19:34,970
you're really moving away from
robustness yes all of life is capable of

1052
00:19:34,970 --> 00:19:34,980
robustness yes all of life is capable of
 

1053
00:19:34,980 --> 00:19:37,010
robustness yes all of life is capable of
reproducing without needing to go to a

1054
00:19:37,010 --> 00:19:37,020
reproducing without needing to go to a
 

1055
00:19:37,020 --> 00:19:39,289
reproducing without needing to go to a
repair shop life will continue to

1056
00:19:39,289 --> 00:19:39,299
repair shop life will continue to
 

1057
00:19:39,299 --> 00:19:41,150
repair shop life will continue to
reproduce in the complete absence of

1058
00:19:41,150 --> 00:19:41,160
reproduce in the complete absence of
 

1059
00:19:41,160 --> 00:19:42,470
reproduce in the complete absence of
civilization

1060
00:19:42,470 --> 00:19:42,480
civilization
 

1061
00:19:42,480 --> 00:19:44,029
civilization
robots will not

1062
00:19:44,029 --> 00:19:44,039
robots will not
 

1063
00:19:44,039 --> 00:19:47,810
robots will not
so when the if if the AI apocalypse

1064
00:19:47,810 --> 00:19:47,820
so when the if if the AI apocalypse
 

1065
00:19:47,820 --> 00:19:49,010
so when the if if the AI apocalypse
happens

1066
00:19:49,010 --> 00:19:49,020
happens
 

1067
00:19:49,020 --> 00:19:50,990
happens
I mean the AIS are going to probably die

1068
00:19:50,990 --> 00:19:51,000
I mean the AIS are going to probably die
 

1069
00:19:51,000 --> 00:19:52,070
I mean the AIS are going to probably die
out because I think we're going to get

1070
00:19:52,070 --> 00:19:52,080
out because I think we're going to get
 

1071
00:19:52,080 --> 00:19:53,630
out because I think we're going to get
again super intelligence long before we

1072
00:19:53,630 --> 00:19:53,640
again super intelligence long before we
 

1073
00:19:53,640 --> 00:19:54,890
again super intelligence long before we
get robustness

1074
00:19:54,890 --> 00:19:54,900
get robustness
 

1075
00:19:54,900 --> 00:19:57,289
get robustness
what about if you just improve

1076
00:19:57,289 --> 00:19:57,299
what about if you just improve
 

1077
00:19:57,299 --> 00:20:00,049
what about if you just improve
the Fab to where

1078
00:20:00,049 --> 00:20:00,059
the Fab to where
 

1079
00:20:00,059 --> 00:20:02,270
the Fab to where
you just have a 3D printer that can

1080
00:20:02,270 --> 00:20:02,280
you just have a 3D printer that can
 

1081
00:20:02,280 --> 00:20:03,289
you just have a 3D printer that can
always help you

1082
00:20:03,289 --> 00:20:03,299
always help you
 

1083
00:20:03,299 --> 00:20:04,730
always help you
well that'd be very interesting I'm

1084
00:20:04,730 --> 00:20:04,740
well that'd be very interesting I'm
 

1085
00:20:04,740 --> 00:20:06,890
well that'd be very interesting I'm
interested in building that

1086
00:20:06,890 --> 00:20:06,900
interested in building that
 

1087
00:20:06,900 --> 00:20:08,690
interested in building that
of course you are you think how

1088
00:20:08,690 --> 00:20:08,700
of course you are you think how
 

1089
00:20:08,700 --> 00:20:10,190
of course you are you think how
difficult is that problem to have a

1090
00:20:10,190 --> 00:20:10,200
difficult is that problem to have a
 

1091
00:20:10,200 --> 00:20:12,250
difficult is that problem to have a
robot that uh

1092
00:20:12,250 --> 00:20:12,260
robot that uh
 

1093
00:20:12,260 --> 00:20:15,590
robot that uh
basically can build itself very very

1094
00:20:15,590 --> 00:20:15,600
basically can build itself very very
 

1095
00:20:15,600 --> 00:20:16,549
basically can build itself very very
hard

1096
00:20:16,549 --> 00:20:16,559
hard
 

1097
00:20:16,559 --> 00:20:19,669
hard
I think you've mentioned this like uh to

1098
00:20:19,669 --> 00:20:19,679
I think you've mentioned this like uh to
 

1099
00:20:19,679 --> 00:20:22,490
I think you've mentioned this like uh to
me or somewhere where people think it's

1100
00:20:22,490 --> 00:20:22,500
me or somewhere where people think it's
 

1101
00:20:22,500 --> 00:20:24,230
me or somewhere where people think it's
easy conceptually

1102
00:20:24,230 --> 00:20:24,240
easy conceptually
 

1103
00:20:24,240 --> 00:20:26,210
easy conceptually
and then they remember that you're going

1104
00:20:26,210 --> 00:20:26,220
and then they remember that you're going
 

1105
00:20:26,220 --> 00:20:29,330
and then they remember that you're going
to have to have a Fab yeah on board of

1106
00:20:29,330 --> 00:20:29,340
to have to have a Fab yeah on board of
 

1107
00:20:29,340 --> 00:20:30,289
to have to have a Fab yeah on board of
course

1108
00:20:30,289 --> 00:20:30,299
course
 

1109
00:20:30,299 --> 00:20:33,110
course
so 3D printer that prints a 3D printer

1110
00:20:33,110 --> 00:20:33,120
so 3D printer that prints a 3D printer
 

1111
00:20:33,120 --> 00:20:36,230
so 3D printer that prints a 3D printer
yeah yeah on legs

1112
00:20:36,230 --> 00:20:36,240
yeah yeah on legs
 

1113
00:20:36,240 --> 00:20:37,730
yeah yeah on legs
yeah hard

1114
00:20:37,730 --> 00:20:37,740
yeah hard
 

1115
00:20:37,740 --> 00:20:40,070
yeah hard
well because it's I mean a 3D printer is

1116
00:20:40,070 --> 00:20:40,080
well because it's I mean a 3D printer is
 

1117
00:20:40,080 --> 00:20:43,190
well because it's I mean a 3D printer is
a very simple machine right okay you're

1118
00:20:43,190 --> 00:20:43,200
a very simple machine right okay you're
 

1119
00:20:43,200 --> 00:20:44,810
a very simple machine right okay you're
gonna print chips you're going to have

1120
00:20:44,810 --> 00:20:44,820
gonna print chips you're going to have
 

1121
00:20:44,820 --> 00:20:46,190
gonna print chips you're going to have
an atomic printer how are you going to

1122
00:20:46,190 --> 00:20:46,200
an atomic printer how are you going to
 

1123
00:20:46,200 --> 00:20:49,070
an atomic printer how are you going to
dope the Silicon yeah right

1124
00:20:49,070 --> 00:20:49,080
dope the Silicon yeah right
 

1125
00:20:49,080 --> 00:20:50,990
dope the Silicon yeah right
how are you gonna etch the Silicon

1126
00:20:50,990 --> 00:20:51,000
how are you gonna etch the Silicon
 

1127
00:20:51,000 --> 00:20:53,870
how are you gonna etch the Silicon
you're gonna have to have a a very

1128
00:20:53,870 --> 00:20:53,880
you're gonna have to have a a very
 

1129
00:20:53,880 --> 00:20:55,970
you're gonna have to have a a very
interesting kind of Fab if you wanna

1130
00:20:55,970 --> 00:20:55,980
interesting kind of Fab if you wanna
 

1131
00:20:55,980 --> 00:20:58,850
interesting kind of Fab if you wanna
have a lot of computation on board

1132
00:20:58,850 --> 00:20:58,860
have a lot of computation on board
 

1133
00:20:58,860 --> 00:21:01,450
have a lot of computation on board
but you can do like

1134
00:21:01,450 --> 00:21:01,460
but you can do like
 

1135
00:21:01,460 --> 00:21:04,730
but you can do like
structural type of robots that are dumb

1136
00:21:04,730 --> 00:21:04,740
structural type of robots that are dumb
 

1137
00:21:04,740 --> 00:21:07,190
structural type of robots that are dumb
yeah but structural type of robots

1138
00:21:07,190 --> 00:21:07,200
yeah but structural type of robots
 

1139
00:21:07,200 --> 00:21:08,450
yeah but structural type of robots
aren't going to have the intelligence

1140
00:21:08,450 --> 00:21:08,460
aren't going to have the intelligence
 

1141
00:21:08,460 --> 00:21:10,070
aren't going to have the intelligence
required to survive in any complex

1142
00:21:10,070 --> 00:21:10,080
required to survive in any complex
 

1143
00:21:10,080 --> 00:21:12,770
required to survive in any complex
environment what about like ants type of

1144
00:21:12,770 --> 00:21:12,780
environment what about like ants type of
 

1145
00:21:12,780 --> 00:21:14,870
environment what about like ants type of
systems we have like trillions of them

1146
00:21:14,870 --> 00:21:14,880
systems we have like trillions of them
 

1147
00:21:14,880 --> 00:21:17,090
systems we have like trillions of them
I don't think this works I mean again

1148
00:21:17,090 --> 00:21:17,100
I don't think this works I mean again
 

1149
00:21:17,100 --> 00:21:19,789
I don't think this works I mean again
like ants at their very core are made up

1150
00:21:19,789 --> 00:21:19,799
like ants at their very core are made up
 

1151
00:21:19,799 --> 00:21:21,110
like ants at their very core are made up
of cells that are capable of

1152
00:21:21,110 --> 00:21:21,120
of cells that are capable of
 

1153
00:21:21,120 --> 00:21:23,150
of cells that are capable of
individually reproducing they're doing

1154
00:21:23,150 --> 00:21:23,160
individually reproducing they're doing
 

1155
00:21:23,160 --> 00:21:25,370
individually reproducing they're doing
quite a lot a lot of computation that

1156
00:21:25,370 --> 00:21:25,380
quite a lot a lot of computation that
 

1157
00:21:25,380 --> 00:21:27,049
quite a lot a lot of computation that
we're taking for granted it's not even

1158
00:21:27,049 --> 00:21:27,059
we're taking for granted it's not even
 

1159
00:21:27,059 --> 00:21:28,310
we're taking for granted it's not even
just the computation it's that

1160
00:21:28,310 --> 00:21:28,320
just the computation it's that
 

1161
00:21:28,320 --> 00:21:30,289
just the computation it's that
reproduction is so inherent okay so like

1162
00:21:30,289 --> 00:21:30,299
reproduction is so inherent okay so like
 

1163
00:21:30,299 --> 00:21:31,789
reproduction is so inherent okay so like
there's two stacks of life in the world

1164
00:21:31,789 --> 00:21:31,799
there's two stacks of life in the world
 

1165
00:21:31,799 --> 00:21:34,010
there's two stacks of life in the world
there's bio the biological stack and the

1166
00:21:34,010 --> 00:21:34,020
there's bio the biological stack and the
 

1167
00:21:34,020 --> 00:21:36,529
there's bio the biological stack and the
Silicon stack the biological stack

1168
00:21:36,529 --> 00:21:36,539
Silicon stack the biological stack
 

1169
00:21:36,539 --> 00:21:38,870
Silicon stack the biological stack
starts with reproduction

1170
00:21:38,870 --> 00:21:38,880
starts with reproduction
 

1171
00:21:38,880 --> 00:21:41,390
starts with reproduction
reproduction is at the absolute core the

1172
00:21:41,390 --> 00:21:41,400
reproduction is at the absolute core the
 

1173
00:21:41,400 --> 00:21:43,789
reproduction is at the absolute core the
first proto-rna organisms were capable

1174
00:21:43,789 --> 00:21:43,799
first proto-rna organisms were capable
 

1175
00:21:43,799 --> 00:21:45,350
first proto-rna organisms were capable
of reproducing

1176
00:21:45,350 --> 00:21:45,360
of reproducing
 

1177
00:21:45,360 --> 00:21:48,169
of reproducing
wait the Silicon stack despite as far as

1178
00:21:48,169 --> 00:21:48,179
wait the Silicon stack despite as far as
 

1179
00:21:48,179 --> 00:21:49,130
wait the Silicon stack despite as far as
it's come

1180
00:21:49,130 --> 00:21:49,140
it's come
 

1181
00:21:49,140 --> 00:21:51,649
it's come
is nowhere near being able to reproduce

1182
00:21:51,649 --> 00:21:51,659
is nowhere near being able to reproduce
 

1183
00:21:51,659 --> 00:21:52,909
is nowhere near being able to reproduce
yeah

1184
00:21:52,909 --> 00:21:52,919
yeah
 

1185
00:21:52,919 --> 00:21:55,450
yeah
so the the Fab movement

1186
00:21:55,450 --> 00:21:55,460
so the the Fab movement
 

1187
00:21:55,460 --> 00:21:59,390
so the the Fab movement
uh digital fabrication

1188
00:21:59,390 --> 00:21:59,400
uh digital fabrication
 

1189
00:21:59,400 --> 00:22:01,250
uh digital fabrication
Fabrication in the full range of what

1190
00:22:01,250 --> 00:22:01,260
Fabrication in the full range of what
 

1191
00:22:01,260 --> 00:22:03,430
Fabrication in the full range of what
that means is still in the early stages

1192
00:22:03,430 --> 00:22:03,440
that means is still in the early stages
 

1193
00:22:03,440 --> 00:22:06,710
that means is still in the early stages
yeah you're interested in this world

1194
00:22:06,710 --> 00:22:06,720
yeah you're interested in this world
 

1195
00:22:06,720 --> 00:22:08,870
yeah you're interested in this world
even if you did put a Fab on the machine

1196
00:22:08,870 --> 00:22:08,880
even if you did put a Fab on the machine
 

1197
00:22:08,880 --> 00:22:10,490
even if you did put a Fab on the machine
right let's say okay and we can build

1198
00:22:10,490 --> 00:22:10,500
right let's say okay and we can build
 

1199
00:22:10,500 --> 00:22:12,409
right let's say okay and we can build
apps we know how to do this Humanity we

1200
00:22:12,409 --> 00:22:12,419
apps we know how to do this Humanity we
 

1201
00:22:12,419 --> 00:22:14,330
apps we know how to do this Humanity we
can probably put all the precursors that

1202
00:22:14,330 --> 00:22:14,340
can probably put all the precursors that
 

1203
00:22:14,340 --> 00:22:15,710
can probably put all the precursors that
build all the machines in the Fabs also

1204
00:22:15,710 --> 00:22:15,720
build all the machines in the Fabs also
 

1205
00:22:15,720 --> 00:22:17,090
build all the machines in the Fabs also
in the machine so first off this machine

1206
00:22:17,090 --> 00:22:17,100
in the machine so first off this machine
 

1207
00:22:17,100 --> 00:22:18,770
in the machine so first off this machine
is going to be absolutely massive

1208
00:22:18,770 --> 00:22:18,780
is going to be absolutely massive
 

1209
00:22:18,780 --> 00:22:22,010
is going to be absolutely massive
I mean we almost have a like think of

1210
00:22:22,010 --> 00:22:22,020
I mean we almost have a like think of
 

1211
00:22:22,020 --> 00:22:23,750
I mean we almost have a like think of
the size of the thing required to

1212
00:22:23,750 --> 00:22:23,760
the size of the thing required to
 

1213
00:22:23,760 --> 00:22:27,529
the size of the thing required to
reproduce a machine today right like is

1214
00:22:27,529 --> 00:22:27,539
reproduce a machine today right like is
 

1215
00:22:27,539 --> 00:22:30,230
reproduce a machine today right like is
our civilization capable of reproduction

1216
00:22:30,230 --> 00:22:30,240
our civilization capable of reproduction
 

1217
00:22:30,240 --> 00:22:32,210
our civilization capable of reproduction
can we reproduce our civilization on

1218
00:22:32,210 --> 00:22:32,220
can we reproduce our civilization on
 

1219
00:22:32,220 --> 00:22:34,310
can we reproduce our civilization on
Mars

1220
00:22:34,310 --> 00:22:34,320
Mars
 

1221
00:22:34,320 --> 00:22:36,169
Mars
if we were to construct a machine that

1222
00:22:36,169 --> 00:22:36,179
if we were to construct a machine that
 

1223
00:22:36,179 --> 00:22:37,850
if we were to construct a machine that
is made up of humans

1224
00:22:37,850 --> 00:22:37,860
is made up of humans
 

1225
00:22:37,860 --> 00:22:40,070
is made up of humans
like a company that can reproduce itself

1226
00:22:40,070 --> 00:22:40,080
like a company that can reproduce itself
 

1227
00:22:40,080 --> 00:22:41,149
like a company that can reproduce itself
yeah

1228
00:22:41,149 --> 00:22:41,159
yeah
 

1229
00:22:41,159 --> 00:22:46,370
yeah
I don't know it feels like like 115

1230
00:22:46,370 --> 00:22:46,380
I don't know it feels like like 115
 

1231
00:22:46,380 --> 00:22:47,510
I don't know it feels like like 115
people

1232
00:22:47,510 --> 00:22:47,520
people
 

1233
00:22:47,520 --> 00:22:49,810
people
I get so much harder than that

1234
00:22:49,810 --> 00:22:49,820
I get so much harder than that
 

1235
00:22:49,820 --> 00:22:52,390
I get so much harder than that
120.

1236
00:22:52,390 --> 00:22:52,400
120.
 

1237
00:22:52,400 --> 00:22:54,950
120.
I believe that Twitter can be run by 50

1238
00:22:54,950 --> 00:22:54,960
I believe that Twitter can be run by 50
 

1239
00:22:54,960 --> 00:22:56,870
I believe that Twitter can be run by 50
people uh

1240
00:22:56,870 --> 00:22:56,880
people uh
 

1241
00:22:56,880 --> 00:22:59,510
people uh
I think that this is going to take most

1242
00:22:59,510 --> 00:22:59,520
I think that this is going to take most
 

1243
00:22:59,520 --> 00:23:02,210
I think that this is going to take most
of like it's just most of society right

1244
00:23:02,210 --> 00:23:02,220
of like it's just most of society right
 

1245
00:23:02,220 --> 00:23:04,370
of like it's just most of society right
like we live in one globalized world no

1246
00:23:04,370 --> 00:23:04,380
like we live in one globalized world no
 

1247
00:23:04,380 --> 00:23:05,630
like we live in one globalized world no
but you're not interested in running

1248
00:23:05,630 --> 00:23:05,640
but you're not interested in running
 

1249
00:23:05,640 --> 00:23:08,029
but you're not interested in running
Twitter you're interested in seeding

1250
00:23:08,029 --> 00:23:08,039
Twitter you're interested in seeding
 

1251
00:23:08,039 --> 00:23:10,850
Twitter you're interested in seeding
like um you want to see the civilization

1252
00:23:10,850 --> 00:23:10,860
like um you want to see the civilization
 

1253
00:23:10,860 --> 00:23:13,669
like um you want to see the civilization
and then because humans can like oh okay

1254
00:23:13,669 --> 00:23:13,679
and then because humans can like oh okay
 

1255
00:23:13,679 --> 00:23:15,169
and then because humans can like oh okay
you're talking about yeah okay so you're

1256
00:23:15,169 --> 00:23:15,179
you're talking about yeah okay so you're
 

1257
00:23:15,179 --> 00:23:16,730
you're talking about yeah okay so you're
talking about the humans reproducing and

1258
00:23:16,730 --> 00:23:16,740
talking about the humans reproducing and
 

1259
00:23:16,740 --> 00:23:18,169
talking about the humans reproducing and
like basically like what's the smallest

1260
00:23:18,169 --> 00:23:18,179
like basically like what's the smallest
 

1261
00:23:18,179 --> 00:23:19,970
like basically like what's the smallest
self-sustaining colony of humans yeah

1262
00:23:19,970 --> 00:23:19,980
self-sustaining colony of humans yeah
 

1263
00:23:19,980 --> 00:23:21,409
self-sustaining colony of humans yeah
yeah okay fine but they're not going to

1264
00:23:21,409 --> 00:23:21,419
yeah okay fine but they're not going to
 

1265
00:23:21,419 --> 00:23:23,270
yeah okay fine but they're not going to
be making five nanometer chips over time

1266
00:23:23,270 --> 00:23:23,280
be making five nanometer chips over time
 

1267
00:23:23,280 --> 00:23:26,090
be making five nanometer chips over time
they will I think you're being like we

1268
00:23:26,090 --> 00:23:26,100
they will I think you're being like we
 

1269
00:23:26,100 --> 00:23:27,890
they will I think you're being like we
have to expand our conception of time

1270
00:23:27,890 --> 00:23:27,900
have to expand our conception of time
 

1271
00:23:27,900 --> 00:23:31,190
have to expand our conception of time
here going back to the original uh time

1272
00:23:31,190 --> 00:23:31,200
here going back to the original uh time
 

1273
00:23:31,200 --> 00:23:34,190
here going back to the original uh time
scale I mean over across

1274
00:23:34,190 --> 00:23:34,200
scale I mean over across
 

1275
00:23:34,200 --> 00:23:36,289
scale I mean over across
maybe 100 Generations we're back to

1276
00:23:36,289 --> 00:23:36,299
maybe 100 Generations we're back to
 

1277
00:23:36,299 --> 00:23:39,470
maybe 100 Generations we're back to
making chips no if you see the colony

1278
00:23:39,470 --> 00:23:39,480
making chips no if you see the colony
 

1279
00:23:39,480 --> 00:23:42,049
making chips no if you see the colony
correctly maybe or maybe they'll watch

1280
00:23:42,049 --> 00:23:42,059
correctly maybe or maybe they'll watch
 

1281
00:23:42,059 --> 00:23:42,890
correctly maybe or maybe they'll watch
our

1282
00:23:42,890 --> 00:23:42,900
our
 

1283
00:23:42,900 --> 00:23:44,930
our
Colony die out over here and be like

1284
00:23:44,930 --> 00:23:44,940
Colony die out over here and be like
 

1285
00:23:44,940 --> 00:23:46,730
Colony die out over here and be like
we're not making chips don't make chips

1286
00:23:46,730 --> 00:23:46,740
we're not making chips don't make chips
 

1287
00:23:46,740 --> 00:23:48,230
we're not making chips don't make chips
maybe you have to seed that Colony

1288
00:23:48,230 --> 00:23:48,240
maybe you have to seed that Colony
 

1289
00:23:48,240 --> 00:23:49,850
maybe you have to seed that Colony
correctly whatever you do don't make

1290
00:23:49,850 --> 00:23:49,860
correctly whatever you do don't make
 

1291
00:23:49,860 --> 00:23:51,830
correctly whatever you do don't make
chips chips are what led to their

1292
00:23:51,830 --> 00:23:51,840
chips chips are what led to their
 

1293
00:23:51,840 --> 00:23:53,090
chips chips are what led to their
downfall

1294
00:23:53,090 --> 00:23:53,100
downfall
 

1295
00:23:53,100 --> 00:23:54,409
downfall
hmm

1296
00:23:54,409 --> 00:23:54,419
hmm
 

1297
00:23:54,419 --> 00:23:56,149
hmm
well that is the thing that humans do

1298
00:23:56,149 --> 00:23:56,159
well that is the thing that humans do
 

1299
00:23:56,159 --> 00:23:58,610
well that is the thing that humans do
they they come up they construct a devil

1300
00:23:58,610 --> 00:23:58,620
they they come up they construct a devil
 

1301
00:23:58,620 --> 00:24:00,409

1303
00:24:00,419 --> 00:24:01,850
a good thing and a bad thing and they
really stick by that and then they

1304
00:24:01,850 --> 00:24:01,860
really stick by that and then they
 

1305
00:24:01,860 --> 00:24:03,289
really stick by that and then they
murder each other over that there's

1306
00:24:03,289 --> 00:24:03,299
murder each other over that there's
 

1307
00:24:03,299 --> 00:24:04,549
murder each other over that there's
always one [\h__\h] in the room who

a question right Humanity works really

1316
00:24:13,490 --> 00:24:13,500
a question right Humanity works really
 

1317
00:24:13,500 --> 00:24:15,049

hard today to get rid of that [\h__\h]
but I think they might be important yeah

1320
00:24:17,270 --> 00:24:17,280
but I think they might be important yeah
 

1321
00:24:17,280 --> 00:24:19,310
but I think they might be important yeah
this whole freedom of speech thing it's

1322
00:24:19,310 --> 00:24:19,320
this whole freedom of speech thing it's
 

1323
00:24:19,320 --> 00:24:21,049
this whole freedom of speech thing it's
it's the freedom of being an [\h__\h]

seems kind of important right

1326
00:24:23,330 --> 00:24:23,340
seems kind of important right
 

1327
00:24:23,340 --> 00:24:26,510
seems kind of important right
man this thing this Fab this human Fab

1328
00:24:26,510 --> 00:24:26,520
man this thing this Fab this human Fab
 

1329
00:24:26,520 --> 00:24:28,250
man this thing this Fab this human Fab
that we constructed as human

1330
00:24:28,250 --> 00:24:28,260
that we constructed as human
 

1331
00:24:28,260 --> 00:24:30,169
that we constructed as human
civilization is pretty interesting and

1332
00:24:30,169 --> 00:24:30,179
civilization is pretty interesting and
 

1333
00:24:30,179 --> 00:24:33,710
civilization is pretty interesting and
now it's building artificial copies of

1334
00:24:33,710 --> 00:24:33,720
now it's building artificial copies of
 

1335
00:24:33,720 --> 00:24:36,789
now it's building artificial copies of
itself or artificial copies of various

1336
00:24:36,789 --> 00:24:36,799
itself or artificial copies of various
 

1337
00:24:36,799 --> 00:24:39,169
itself or artificial copies of various
aspects of itself that seem interesting

1338
00:24:39,169 --> 00:24:39,179
aspects of itself that seem interesting
 

1339
00:24:39,179 --> 00:24:41,390
aspects of itself that seem interesting
like intelligence

1340
00:24:41,390 --> 00:24:41,400
like intelligence
 

1341
00:24:41,400 --> 00:24:44,270
like intelligence
and I wonder where that goes

1342
00:24:44,270 --> 00:24:44,280
and I wonder where that goes
 

1343
00:24:44,280 --> 00:24:45,529
and I wonder where that goes
I like to think it's just like another

1344
00:24:45,529 --> 00:24:45,539
I like to think it's just like another
 

1345
00:24:45,539 --> 00:24:47,029
I like to think it's just like another
stack for life like we have like the

1346
00:24:47,029 --> 00:24:47,039
stack for life like we have like the
 

1347
00:24:47,039 --> 00:24:48,770
stack for life like we have like the
biostack life like we're a biostack life

1348
00:24:48,770 --> 00:24:48,780
biostack life like we're a biostack life
 

1349
00:24:48,780 --> 00:24:50,990
biostack life like we're a biostack life
and then the Silicon stack life but it

1350
00:24:50,990 --> 00:24:51,000
and then the Silicon stack life but it
 

1351
00:24:51,000 --> 00:24:52,430
and then the Silicon stack life but it
seems like the ceiling

1352
00:24:52,430 --> 00:24:52,440
seems like the ceiling
 

1353
00:24:52,440 --> 00:24:54,529
seems like the ceiling
or they might not be a ceiling and or at

1354
00:24:54,529 --> 00:24:54,539
or they might not be a ceiling and or at
 

1355
00:24:54,539 --> 00:24:55,909
or they might not be a ceiling and or at
least the ceiling is much higher for the

1356
00:24:55,909 --> 00:24:55,919
least the ceiling is much higher for the
 

1357
00:24:55,919 --> 00:24:58,970
least the ceiling is much higher for the
for the Silicon stack oh no I don't I we

1358
00:24:58,970 --> 00:24:58,980
for the Silicon stack oh no I don't I we
 

1359
00:24:58,980 --> 00:25:00,049
for the Silicon stack oh no I don't I we
don't know what the ceiling is for the

1360
00:25:00,049 --> 00:25:00,059
don't know what the ceiling is for the
 

1361
00:25:00,059 --> 00:25:01,850
don't know what the ceiling is for the
biostack either the biostack the

1362
00:25:01,850 --> 00:25:01,860
biostack either the biostack the
 

1363
00:25:01,860 --> 00:25:04,310
biostack either the biostack the
biostack just seemed to move slower

1364
00:25:04,310 --> 00:25:04,320
biostack just seemed to move slower
 

1365
00:25:04,320 --> 00:25:07,190
biostack just seemed to move slower
um you have Moore's Law uh which is not

1366
00:25:07,190 --> 00:25:07,200
um you have Moore's Law uh which is not
 

1367
00:25:07,200 --> 00:25:10,190
um you have Moore's Law uh which is not
dead despite many proclamations uh into

house stack or the silver in the Silicon

1370
00:25:11,930 --> 00:25:11,940
house stack or the silver in the Silicon
 

1371
00:25:11,940 --> 00:25:13,130
house stack or the silver in the Silicon
stack and you don't have anything like

1372
00:25:13,130 --> 00:25:13,140
stack and you don't have anything like
 

1373
00:25:13,140 --> 00:25:15,350
stack and you don't have anything like
this in the biostack so I have a meme

1374
00:25:15,350 --> 00:25:15,360
this in the biostack so I have a meme
 

1375
00:25:15,360 --> 00:25:17,090
this in the biostack so I have a meme
that I posted I tried to make a meme it

1376
00:25:17,090 --> 00:25:17,100
that I posted I tried to make a meme it
 

1377

Joe Biden and you look this is 1980 and
 

1383
00:25:23,220 --> 00:25:25,370
Joe Biden and you look this is 1980 and
this is 2020. yeah and these two humans

1384
00:25:25,370 --> 00:25:25,380
this is 2020. yeah and these two humans
 

1385
00:25:25,380 --> 00:25:26,810
this is 2020. yeah and these two humans
are basically like the same right

1386
00:25:26,810 --> 00:25:26,820
are basically like the same right
 

1387
00:25:26,820 --> 00:25:29,690
are basically like the same right
there's no there's no like like they're

1389
00:25:29,700 --> 00:25:32,750
there's no there's no like like they're
there's been no change in humans in the

1390
00:25:32,750 --> 00:25:32,760
there's been no change in humans in the
 

1391
00:25:32,760 --> 00:25:35,330
there's been no change in humans in the
last 40 years yeah and then I posted a

1392
00:25:35,330 --> 00:25:35,340
last 40 years yeah and then I posted a
 

1393
00:25:35,340 --> 00:25:36,830
last 40 years yeah and then I posted a
computer from 1980 in a computer from

1394
00:25:36,830 --> 00:25:36,840
computer from 1980 in a computer from
 

1395
00:25:36,840 --> 00:25:40,850
computer from 1980 in a computer from
2020. wow

1396
00:25:40,850 --> 00:25:40,860

 

1397
00:25:40,860 --> 00:25:43,070

yeah with their early early stages right

1398
00:25:43,070 --> 00:25:43,080
yeah with their early early stages right
 

1399
00:25:43,080 --> 00:25:44,870
yeah with their early early stages right
which is why you said when you said the

1400
00:25:44,870 --> 00:25:44,880
which is why you said when you said the
 

1401
00:25:44,880 --> 00:25:47,690
which is why you said when you said the
Fab the size of the Fab required to make

1402
00:25:47,690 --> 00:25:47,700
Fab the size of the Fab required to make
 

1403
00:25:47,700 --> 00:25:50,690
Fab the size of the Fab required to make
another Fab is like uh

1404
00:25:50,690 --> 00:25:50,700
another Fab is like uh
 

1405
00:25:50,700 --> 00:25:53,289
another Fab is like uh
very large right now oh yeah but

1406
00:25:53,289 --> 00:25:53,299
very large right now oh yeah but
 

1407
00:25:53,299 --> 00:25:57,049
very large right now oh yeah but
computers were very large

1408
00:25:57,049 --> 00:25:57,059

 

1409
00:25:57,059 --> 00:25:59,149

how far away are we do you think

1438
00:26:30,950 --> 00:26:30,960
how far away are we do you think
 

1439
00:26:30,960 --> 00:26:33,409
how far away are we do you think

00:31:35,750 --> 00:31:35,760
really easy you can
 

1709
00:31:35,760 --> 00:31:39,169
really easy you can
game recognize this game yeah versus the

1710
00:31:39,169 --> 00:31:39,179

Silicon stack stuff it's like you have

1712
00:31:41,450 --> 00:31:41,460
Silicon stack stuff it's like you have
 

1713
00:31:41,460 --> 00:31:42,649
Silicon stack stuff it's like you have
no idea

1714
00:31:42,649 --> 00:31:42,659
no idea
 

1715
00:31:42,659 --> 00:31:44,870
no idea
you have view it well the little thing

1716
00:31:44,870 --> 00:31:44,880
you have view it well the little thing
 

1717
00:31:44,880 --> 00:31:46,549
you have view it well the little thing
has learned to mimic

1718
00:31:46,549 --> 00:31:46,559
has learned to mimic
 

1719
00:31:46,559 --> 00:31:49,549
has learned to mimic
you know

1720
00:31:49,549 --> 00:31:49,559

 

1721
00:31:49,559 --> 00:31:51,529

but then I realize that that's all we

1722
00:31:51,529 --> 00:31:51,539
but then I realize that that's all we
 

1723
00:31:51,539 --> 00:31:53,389
but then I realize that that's all we
are too oh look the little thing has

1724
00:31:53,389 --> 00:31:53,399
are too oh look the little thing has
 

1725
00:31:53,399 --> 00:31:56,510
are too oh look the little thing has
learned to mimic yeah I guess uh yeah

1726
00:31:56,510 --> 00:31:56,520
learned to mimic yeah I guess uh yeah
 

1727
00:31:56,520 --> 00:31:59,769
learned to mimic yeah I guess uh yeah
404 could be could be suffering but it's

1728
00:31:59,769 --> 00:31:59,779
404 could be could be suffering but it's
 

1729
00:31:59,779 --> 00:32:02,149
404 could be could be suffering but it's
so far

1730
00:32:02,149 --> 00:32:02,159
so far
 

1731
00:32:02,159 --> 00:32:05,269
so far
from our kind of living organism our

1732
00:32:05,269 --> 00:32:05,279
from our kind of living organism our
 

1733
00:32:05,279 --> 00:32:08,210
from our kind of living organism our
kind of Stack but it feels like AI can

1734
00:32:08,210 --> 00:32:08,220
kind of Stack but it feels like AI can
 

1735
00:32:08,220 --> 00:32:09,049
kind of Stack but it feels like AI can
start

1736
00:32:09,049 --> 00:32:09,059
start
 

1737
00:32:09,059 --> 00:32:11,810
start
maybe mimicking the biological stack

1738
00:32:11,810 --> 00:32:11,820
maybe mimicking the biological stack
 

1739
00:32:11,820 --> 00:32:13,370
maybe mimicking the biological stack
better but about it because it's trained

1740
00:32:13,370 --> 00:32:13,380
better but about it because it's trained
 

1741
00:32:13,380 --> 00:32:14,750
better but about it because it's trained
we trained it yeah

1742
00:32:14,750 --> 00:32:14,760
we trained it yeah
 

1743
00:32:14,760 --> 00:32:16,789
we trained it yeah
and so in that maybe that's the

1744
00:32:16,789 --> 00:32:16,799
and so in that maybe that's the
 

1745
00:32:16,799 --> 00:32:19,130
and so in that maybe that's the
definition of Consciousness is the the

1746
00:32:19,130 --> 00:32:19,140
definition of Consciousness is the the
 

1747
00:32:19,140 --> 00:32:20,750
definition of Consciousness is the the
biostat Consciousness the definition of

1748
00:32:20,750 --> 00:32:20,760
biostat Consciousness the definition of
 

1749
00:32:20,760 --> 00:32:22,010
biostat Consciousness the definition of
Consciousness is how close something

1750
00:32:22,010 --> 00:32:22,020
Consciousness is how close something
 

1751
00:32:22,020 --> 00:32:23,750
Consciousness is how close something
looks to human sure I'll give you that

1752
00:32:23,750 --> 00:32:23,760
looks to human sure I'll give you that
 

1753
00:32:23,760 --> 00:32:27,769

Human Experience sure

1756
00:32:29,930 --> 00:32:29,940
Human Experience sure
 

1757
00:32:29,940 --> 00:32:32,269
Human Experience sure
it's a very it's a very anthropocentric

1758
00:32:32,269 --> 00:32:32,279
it's a very it's a very anthropocentric
 

1759

00:32:43,070 --> 00:32:43,080
third company will be AI girlfriends
 

1769
00:32:43,080 --> 00:32:44,930
third company will be AI girlfriends
oh like I mean I want to find out what

1770

relationships with AI That's creating
 

1785
00:32:58,559 --> 00:33:01,190
relationships with AI That's creating
human-like organisms right

1786
00:33:01,190 --> 00:33:01,200
human-like organisms right
 

1787
00:33:01,200 --> 00:33:02,810
human-like organisms right
and part of being human is being

1788
00:33:02,810 --> 00:33:02,820
and part of being human is being
 

1789
00:33:02,820 --> 00:33:05,149
and part of being human is being

conscious is being having the capacity
 

1791
00:33:05,159 --> 00:33:06,649
conscious is being having the capacity
to suffer having the capacity to

experience this leveragely in such a way
 

1795
00:33:09,059 --> 00:33:10,549
experience this leveragely in such a way
that you can empathize

1796
00:33:10,549 --> 00:33:10,559
that you can empathize
 

1797
00:33:10,559 --> 00:33:12,590
that you can empathize
the AIS is going to empathize with you

1798
00:33:12,590 --> 00:33:12,600
the AIS is going to empathize with you
 

1799
00:33:12,600 --> 00:33:14,870
the AIS is going to empathize with you
and you can empathize with it or you can

1800
00:33:14,870 --> 00:33:14,880
and you can empathize with it or you can
 

1801
00:33:14,880 --> 00:33:19,070
and you can empathize with it or you can
project your uh anthropomorphic sense of

1802
00:33:19,070 --> 00:33:19,080
project your uh anthropomorphic sense of
 

1803
00:33:19,080 --> 00:33:21,310
project your uh anthropomorphic sense of
what the other entity is experiencing

1804
00:33:21,310 --> 00:33:21,320
what the other entity is experiencing
 

1805
00:33:21,320 --> 00:33:24,649
what the other entity is experiencing
and and an AI model would need to um

1806
00:33:24,649 --> 00:33:24,659
and and an AI model would need to um
 

1807
00:33:24,659 --> 00:33:26,330
and and an AI model would need to um
yeah to create that experience inside

1808
00:33:26,330 --> 00:33:26,340
yeah to create that experience inside
 

1809
00:33:26,340 --> 00:33:28,370
yeah to create that experience inside
your mind and it doesn't seem that

1810
00:33:28,370 --> 00:33:28,380
your mind and it doesn't seem that
 

1811
00:33:28,380 --> 00:33:30,769
your mind and it doesn't seem that
difficult yeah but okay so here's where

1812
00:33:30,769 --> 00:33:30,779
difficult yeah but okay so here's where
 

1813
00:33:30,779 --> 00:33:33,590
difficult yeah but okay so here's where
it actually gets totally different right

1814
00:33:33,590 --> 00:33:33,600
it actually gets totally different right
 

1815
00:33:33,600 --> 00:33:35,090
it actually gets totally different right
would you interact with another human

1816
00:33:35,090 --> 00:33:35,100
would you interact with another human
 

1817
00:33:35,100 --> 00:33:37,549
would you interact with another human
you can make some assumptions

1818
00:33:37,549 --> 00:33:37,559
you can make some assumptions
 

1819
00:33:37,559 --> 00:33:39,950
you can make some assumptions
yeah when you interact with these models

1820
00:33:39,950 --> 00:33:39,960
yeah when you interact with these models
 

1821
00:33:39,960 --> 00:33:41,509
yeah when you interact with these models
you can't you can make some assumptions

you can't you can make some assumptions
 

1823

similar way to you do the golden rule

1828
00:33:47,810 --> 00:33:47,820
similar way to you do the golden rule
 

1829
00:33:47,820 --> 00:33:48,730
similar way to you do the golden rule
applies

1830
00:33:48,730 --> 00:33:48,740
applies
 

1831
00:33:48,740 --> 00:33:51,710
applies
with an AI model this isn't really true

1832
00:33:51,710 --> 00:33:51,720
with an AI model this isn't really true
 

1833
00:33:51,720 --> 00:33:54,169
with an AI model this isn't really true
right these these large language models

1834
00:33:54,169 --> 00:33:54,179
right these these large language models
 

1835
00:33:54,179 --> 00:33:55,549
right these these large language models
are good at fooling people because they

1836
00:33:55,549 --> 00:33:55,559
are good at fooling people because they
 

1837
00:33:55,559 --> 00:33:57,590
are good at fooling people because they
were trained on a a whole bunch of human

1838
00:33:57,590 --> 00:33:57,600
were trained on a a whole bunch of human
 

1839
00:33:57,600 --> 00:34:01,070
were trained on a a whole bunch of human
data and told to mimic it yep but if if

1840
00:34:01,070 --> 00:34:01,080
data and told to mimic it yep but if if
 

1841
00:34:01,080 --> 00:34:03,350
data and told to mimic it yep but if if
the AI system says hi my name is

1842
00:34:03,350 --> 00:34:03,360
the AI system says hi my name is
 

1843
00:34:03,360 --> 00:34:05,149
the AI system says hi my name is
Samantha

1844
00:34:05,149 --> 00:34:05,159
Samantha
 

1845
00:34:05,159 --> 00:34:07,850

here and there yeah maybe it'll

1848
00:34:10,129 --> 00:34:10,139
here and there yeah maybe it'll
 

1849
00:34:10,139 --> 00:34:12,169
here and there yeah maybe it'll
integrate this in AI system I made some

1850
00:34:12,169 --> 00:34:12,179
integrate this in AI system I made some
 

1851
00:34:12,179 --> 00:34:13,550
integrate this in AI system I made some
chat Bots I give them backstories it was

00:38:32,510 --> 00:38:32,520
know it just will only advertise to you
 

2085

some of the time yeah maybe the
 

2087
00:38:34,260 --> 00:38:36,470
some of the time yeah maybe the
conceptions of monogamy change too like

2091
00:38:37,920 --> 00:38:40,310
I grew up in a time like I value
monogamy but maybe that's a silly notion

arbitrary number of AI systems
 

2097
00:38:43,980 --> 00:38:46,130
arbitrary number of AI systems
um this this um this interesting path

2098
00:38:46,130 --> 00:38:46,140
um this this um this interesting path
 

2099
00:38:46,140 --> 00:38:49,010
um this this um this interesting path
from rationality to polyamory yeah that

2100
00:38:49,010 --> 00:38:49,020
from rationality to polyamory yeah that
 

2101
00:38:49,020 --> 00:38:51,109
from rationality to polyamory yeah that
doesn't make sense for me for you but

about like AI chips I started thinking
 

2219
00:40:48,660 --> 00:40:50,089
about like AI chips I started thinking
about chips that run

2220

Ai and I I was like well okay this is
 

2223
00:40:53,280 --> 00:40:55,430
Ai and I I was like well okay this is
going to be a really big problem

2224
00:40:55,430 --> 00:40:55,440
going to be a really big problem
 

2225
00:40:55,440 --> 00:40:59,030
going to be a really big problem
if Nvidia becomes a monopoly here

2226
00:40:59,030 --> 00:40:59,040
if Nvidia becomes a monopoly here
 

2227
00:40:59,040 --> 00:41:00,589
if Nvidia becomes a monopoly here
um how long before Nvidia has

2228
00:41:00,589 --> 00:41:00,599
um how long before Nvidia has
 

2229
00:41:00,599 --> 00:41:02,870
um how long before Nvidia has
nationalized

2230
00:41:02,870 --> 00:41:02,880
nationalized
 

2231
00:41:02,880 --> 00:41:04,609
nationalized
so you uh

2232
00:41:04,609 --> 00:41:04,619
so you uh
 

2233
00:41:04,619 --> 00:41:07,849
so you uh
one of the reasons that start tiny Corp

2234
00:41:07,849 --> 00:41:07,859
one of the reasons that start tiny Corp
 

2235
00:41:07,859 --> 00:41:10,069
one of the reasons that start tiny Corp
is to challenge Nvidia

2236
00:41:10,069 --> 00:41:10,079
is to challenge Nvidia
 

2237
00:41:10,079 --> 00:41:11,810
is to challenge Nvidia
it's not so much

2238
00:41:11,810 --> 00:41:11,820
it's not so much
 

2239
00:41:11,820 --> 00:41:14,569
it's not so much
to challenge Nvidia I actually I I like

2240
00:41:14,569 --> 00:41:14,579
to challenge Nvidia I actually I I like
 

2241
00:41:14,579 --> 00:41:16,550
to challenge Nvidia I actually I I like
Nvidia and

2242
00:41:16,550 --> 00:41:16,560
Nvidia and
 

2243
00:41:16,560 --> 00:41:17,870
Nvidia and
it's

2244
00:41:17,870 --> 00:41:17,880
it's
 

2245
00:41:17,880 --> 00:41:21,050
it's
to make sure power stays decentralized

2246
00:41:21,050 --> 00:41:21,060
to make sure power stays decentralized
 

2247
00:41:21,060 --> 00:41:25,970
to make sure power stays decentralized
yeah and here's uh computational Power

2248
00:41:25,970 --> 00:41:25,980
yeah and here's uh computational Power
 

2249
00:41:25,980 --> 00:41:28,130
yeah and here's uh computational Power
until you Nvidia is kind of locking down

2250
00:41:28,130 --> 00:41:28,140
until you Nvidia is kind of locking down
 

2251
00:41:28,140 --> 00:41:31,250
until you Nvidia is kind of locking down
the computational power of the world if

2252
00:41:31,250 --> 00:41:31,260
the computational power of the world if
 

2253
00:41:31,260 --> 00:41:34,010
the computational power of the world if
Nvidia becomes just like 10x better than

2254
00:41:34,010 --> 00:41:34,020
Nvidia becomes just like 10x better than
 

2255
00:41:34,020 --> 00:41:36,050
Nvidia becomes just like 10x better than
everything else you're giving a big

2256
00:41:36,050 --> 00:41:36,060
everything else you're giving a big
 

2257
00:41:36,060 --> 00:41:39,349
everything else you're giving a big
advantage to somebody who can secure

2258
00:41:39,349 --> 00:41:39,359
advantage to somebody who can secure
 

2259
00:41:39,359 --> 00:41:41,450
advantage to somebody who can secure
Nvidia as a resource

2260
00:41:41,450 --> 00:41:41,460
Nvidia as a resource

yeah in fact if Jensen watches this

2262
00:41:44,329 --> 00:41:44,339
yeah in fact if Jensen watches this
 

2263
00:41:44,339 --> 00:41:46,250
yeah in fact if Jensen watches this
podcast you may want to consider this

2264
00:41:46,250 --> 00:41:46,260
podcast you may want to consider this
 

2265
00:41:46,260 --> 00:41:48,050
podcast you may want to consider this
you may want to consider making sure his

2266
00:41:48,050 --> 00:41:48,060
you may want to consider making sure his
 

2267
00:41:48,060 --> 00:41:50,210
you may want to consider making sure his
company is not nationalized

2268
00:41:50,210 --> 00:41:50,220
company is not nationalized
 

2269
00:41:50,220 --> 00:41:52,670
company is not nationalized
do you think that's an actual threat oh

2270
00:41:52,670 --> 00:41:52,680
do you think that's an actual threat oh
 

2271
00:41:52,680 --> 00:41:54,370
do you think that's an actual threat oh
yes

2272
00:41:54,370 --> 00:41:54,380
yes
 

2273
00:41:54,380 --> 00:41:57,290
yes
no but there's so much uh you know

2274
00:41:57,290 --> 00:41:57,300
no but there's so much uh you know
 

2275
00:41:57,300 --> 00:41:59,750
no but there's so much uh you know
there's AMD so we have Nvidia and AMD

2276
00:41:59,750 --> 00:41:59,760
there's AMD so we have Nvidia and AMD
 

2277
00:41:59,760 --> 00:42:01,370
there's AMD so we have Nvidia and AMD
great all right

2278
00:42:01,370 --> 00:42:01,380
great all right
 

2279
00:42:01,380 --> 00:42:02,810
great all right
but you know you don't think there's

2280
00:42:02,810 --> 00:42:02,820
but you know you don't think there's
 

2281
00:42:02,820 --> 00:42:05,510
but you know you don't think there's
like a push

2282
00:42:05,510 --> 00:42:05,520

 

2283
00:42:05,520 --> 00:42:08,030

towards like selling like Google selling

2284
00:42:08,030 --> 00:42:08,040
towards like selling like Google selling
 

2285
00:42:08,040 --> 00:42:09,470
towards like selling like Google selling
tpus or something like this you don't

2286
00:42:09,470 --> 00:42:09,480
tpus or something like this you don't
 

2287
00:42:09,480 --> 00:42:10,790
tpus or something like this you don't
think there's a push for that have you

2288
00:42:10,790 --> 00:42:10,800
think there's a push for that have you
 

2289
00:42:10,800 --> 00:42:14,270
think there's a push for that have you
seen it Google loves to rent utpus it

2290
00:42:14,270 --> 00:42:14,280
seen it Google loves to rent utpus it
 

2291
00:42:14,280 --> 00:42:17,930
seen it Google loves to rent utpus it
doesn't you can't buy it at Best Buy

2292
00:42:17,930 --> 00:42:17,940

 

2293
00:42:17,940 --> 00:42:21,050

so I started to work on a uh

2294
00:42:21,050 --> 00:42:21,060
so I started to work on a uh
 

2295
00:42:21,060 --> 00:42:23,329
so I started to work on a uh
on a chip I was like okay what's it

2296
00:42:23,329 --> 00:42:23,339
on a chip I was like okay what's it
 

2297
00:42:23,339 --> 00:42:25,609
on a chip I was like okay what's it
gonna take to make a chip and my first

2298
00:42:25,609 --> 00:42:25,619
gonna take to make a chip and my first
 

2299
00:42:25,619 --> 00:42:27,290
gonna take to make a chip and my first
Notions were all completely wrong about

2300
00:42:27,290 --> 00:42:27,300
Notions were all completely wrong about
 

2301
00:42:27,300 --> 00:42:29,089
Notions were all completely wrong about
why about like how you could improve on

2302
00:42:29,089 --> 00:42:29,099
why about like how you could improve on
 

2303
00:42:29,099 --> 00:42:31,490
why about like how you could improve on
gpus uh and I will take this this is

2304
00:42:31,490 --> 00:42:31,500
gpus uh and I will take this this is
 

2305
00:42:31,500 --> 00:42:34,970
gpus uh and I will take this this is
from uh Jim Keller on your podcast and

2306
00:42:34,970 --> 00:42:34,980
from uh Jim Keller on your podcast and
 

2307
00:42:34,980 --> 00:42:37,970
from uh Jim Keller on your podcast and
this is one of my absolute favorite

2308
00:42:37,970 --> 00:42:37,980
this is one of my absolute favorite
 

2309
00:42:37,980 --> 00:42:40,670
this is one of my absolute favorite
descriptions of computation

2310
00:42:40,670 --> 00:42:40,680
descriptions of computation
 

2311
00:42:40,680 --> 00:42:42,050
descriptions of computation
um so there's three kinds of computation

2312
00:42:42,050 --> 00:42:42,060
um so there's three kinds of computation
 

2313
00:42:42,060 --> 00:42:43,849
um so there's three kinds of computation
paradigms that are common in the world

2314
00:42:43,849 --> 00:42:43,859
paradigms that are common in the world
 

2315
00:42:43,859 --> 00:42:44,690
paradigms that are common in the world
today

2316
00:42:44,690 --> 00:42:44,700
today
 

2317
00:42:44,700 --> 00:42:47,510
today
other CPUs and CPUs can do everything

2318
00:42:47,510 --> 00:42:47,520
other CPUs and CPUs can do everything
 

2319
00:42:47,520 --> 00:42:50,690
other CPUs and CPUs can do everything
CPUs can do add and multiply they can do

2320
00:42:50,690 --> 00:42:50,700
CPUs can do add and multiply they can do
 

2321
00:42:50,700 --> 00:42:52,310
CPUs can do add and multiply they can do
load and store and they can do compare

2322
00:42:52,310 --> 00:42:52,320
load and store and they can do compare
 

2323
00:42:52,320 --> 00:42:54,170
load and store and they can do compare
and branch and when I say they can do

2324
00:42:54,170 --> 00:42:54,180
and branch and when I say they can do
 

2325
00:42:54,180 --> 00:42:55,490
and branch and when I say they can do
these things they can do them all fast

2326
00:42:55,490 --> 00:42:55,500
these things they can do them all fast
 

2327
00:42:55,500 --> 00:42:57,829
these things they can do them all fast
right so compare and Branch are unique

2328
00:42:57,829 --> 00:42:57,839
right so compare and Branch are unique
 

2329
00:42:57,839 --> 00:42:59,809
right so compare and Branch are unique
to CPUs and what I mean by they can do

2330
00:42:59,809 --> 00:42:59,819
to CPUs and what I mean by they can do
 

2331
00:42:59,819 --> 00:43:01,130
to CPUs and what I mean by they can do
them fast is they can do things like

2332
00:43:01,130 --> 00:43:01,140
them fast is they can do things like
 

2333
00:43:01,140 --> 00:43:02,569
them fast is they can do things like
Branch prediction and speculative

2334
00:43:02,569 --> 00:43:02,579
Branch prediction and speculative
 

2335
00:43:02,579 --> 00:43:04,069
Branch prediction and speculative
execution and they spend tons of

2336
00:43:04,069 --> 00:43:04,079
execution and they spend tons of
 

2337
00:43:04,079 --> 00:43:05,569
execution and they spend tons of
transistors on these like super deep

2338
00:43:05,569 --> 00:43:05,579
transistors on these like super deep
 

2339
00:43:05,579 --> 00:43:07,730
transistors on these like super deep
reorder buffers in order to make these

2340
00:43:07,730 --> 00:43:07,740
reorder buffers in order to make these
 

2341
00:43:07,740 --> 00:43:08,750
reorder buffers in order to make these
things fast

2342
00:43:08,750 --> 00:43:08,760
things fast
 

2343
00:43:08,760 --> 00:43:10,309
things fast
then you have a simpler computation

2344
00:43:10,309 --> 00:43:10,319
then you have a simpler computation
 

2345
00:43:10,319 --> 00:43:12,710
then you have a simpler computation
model gpus gpus can't really do compare

2347
00:43:12,720 --> 00:43:14,329
model gpus gpus can't really do compare
and Branch I mean they can but it's

2348
00:43:14,329 --> 00:43:14,339
and Branch I mean they can but it's
 

2349
00:43:14,339 --> 00:43:15,829
and Branch I mean they can but it's
horrendously slow

2350

horrendously slow
 

2351
00:43:15,839 --> 00:43:17,690
horrendously slow
but gpus can do arbitrary load in store

but gpus can do arbitrary load in store
 

2353
00:43:17,700 --> 00:43:20,089
but gpus can do arbitrary load in store
right gpus can do things like X

00:43:20,089 --> 00:43:20,099
right gpus can do things like X
 

2355
00:43:20,099 --> 00:43:22,430
right gpus can do things like X

00:43:28,970 --> 00:43:28,980
um the third model of computation is
 

2365
00:43:28,980 --> 00:43:32,089

right like they can do load in stores

2368
00:43:33,349 --> 00:43:33,359
right like they can do load in stores
 

2369
00:43:33,359 --> 00:43:34,910
right like they can do load in stores
but only static load in stores only

so tinyguard really took this idea and
 

2387
00:43:50,760 --> 00:43:53,089
so tinyguard really took this idea and
and I'm still working on it to extend

turn completeness allows you to reason
 

2435
00:44:36,359 --> 00:44:38,569
turn completeness allows you to reason
about things right so the reason you

2436
00:44:38,569 --> 00:44:38,579
about things right so the reason you
 

2437
00:44:38,579 --> 00:44:40,370
about things right so the reason you
need to do Branch prediction in a CPU

2438
00:44:40,370 --> 00:44:40,380
need to do Branch prediction in a CPU
 

2439
00:44:40,380 --> 00:44:41,750
need to do Branch prediction in a CPU
and the reason it's prediction and the

and the reason it's prediction and the
 

2441
00:44:41,760 --> 00:44:42,890
and the reason it's prediction and the
branch predictors are I think they're

branch predictors are I think they're
 

2443
00:44:42,900 --> 00:44:45,710
branch predictors are I think they're
like 99 on CPUs why do they get one

2444
00:44:45,710 --> 00:44:45,720
like 99 on CPUs why do they get one
 

2445
00:44:45,720 --> 00:44:47,510
like 99 on CPUs why do they get one
percent of them wrong well they get one

percent of them wrong well they get one
 

2447
00:44:47,520 --> 00:44:50,329
percent of them wrong well they get one
percent wrong because you can't know

percent wrong because you can't know
 

2449
00:44:50,339 --> 00:44:52,190
percent wrong because you can't know
right that's the halting problem it's

2450
00:44:52,190 --> 00:44:52,200
right that's the halting problem it's
 

2451
00:44:52,200 --> 00:44:53,690
right that's the halting problem it's
equivalent to the halting problem to say

2452
00:44:53,690 --> 00:44:53,700
equivalent to the halting problem to say

so when you realize this you think about

2468
00:45:10,910 --> 00:45:10,920
so when you realize this you think about
 

2469
00:45:10,920 --> 00:45:13,069
so when you realize this you think about
okay how can we build a computer and how

00:45:13,069 --> 00:45:13,079
okay how can we build a computer and how
 

2471
00:45:13,079 --> 00:45:14,990
okay how can we build a computer and how
can we build a stack that takes maximal

00:45:14,990 --> 00:45:15,000
can we build a stack that takes maximal
 

2473
00:45:15,000 --> 00:45:16,930
can we build a stack that takes maximal
advantage of this idea

advantage of this idea
uh so what makes tiny grad different

2476
00:45:20,150 --> 00:45:20,160
uh so what makes tiny grad different
 

2477
00:45:20,160 --> 00:45:22,490
uh so what makes tiny grad different
from other neural network libraries is

2478
00:45:22,490 --> 00:45:22,500
from other neural network libraries is
 

2479
00:45:22,500 --> 00:45:24,290
from other neural network libraries is
it does not have a primitive operator

2480
00:45:24,290 --> 00:45:24,300
it does not have a primitive operator
 

2481
00:45:24,300 --> 00:45:26,390
it does not have a primitive operator
even for matrix multiplication

2482
00:45:26,390 --> 00:45:26,400
even for matrix multiplication
 

2483
00:45:26,400 --> 00:45:28,730
even for matrix multiplication
and this is every single one they even

2484
00:45:28,730 --> 00:45:28,740
and this is every single one they even
 

2485
00:45:28,740 --> 00:45:30,170
and this is every single one they even
have primitive operations things like

2486
00:45:30,170 --> 00:45:30,180
have primitive operations things like
 

2487
00:45:30,180 --> 00:45:33,290
have primitive operations things like
convolutions so no matte mull no mammal

2488

convolutions so no matte mull no mammal
 

2489
00:45:33,300 --> 00:45:35,690
convolutions so no matte mull no mammal
well here's what a maple is so I'll use

2490
00:45:35,690 --> 00:45:35,700
well here's what a maple is so I'll use
 

2491
00:45:35,700 --> 00:45:37,490
well here's what a maple is so I'll use
my hands to talk here so if you think

2492
00:45:37,490 --> 00:45:37,500
my hands to talk here so if you think
 

2493
00:45:37,500 --> 00:45:39,650
my hands to talk here so if you think
about a cube and I put my two matrices

2494
00:45:39,650 --> 00:45:39,660
about a cube and I put my two matrices
 

2495
00:45:39,660 --> 00:45:41,390
about a cube and I put my two matrices
that I'm multiplying on two faces of the

2496
00:45:41,390 --> 00:45:41,400
that I'm multiplying on two faces of the
 

2497
00:45:41,400 --> 00:45:43,910
that I'm multiplying on two faces of the
cube right you can think about the

2498
00:45:43,910 --> 00:45:43,920
cube right you can think about the
 

2499
00:45:43,920 --> 00:45:47,630
cube right you can think about the
Matrix multiply as okay the N cubed I'm

2500
00:45:47,630 --> 00:45:47,640
Matrix multiply as okay the N cubed I'm
 

2501
00:45:47,640 --> 00:45:49,069
Matrix multiply as okay the N cubed I'm
going to multiply for each one in the

2502
00:45:49,069 --> 00:45:49,079
going to multiply for each one in the
 

2503
00:45:49,079 --> 00:45:50,510
going to multiply for each one in the
cubed and then I'm going to do a sum

2504
00:45:50,510 --> 00:45:50,520
cubed and then I'm going to do a sum
 

2505
00:45:50,520 --> 00:45:52,849
cubed and then I'm going to do a sum
which is a reduce up to here to the

2506
00:45:52,849 --> 00:45:52,859
which is a reduce up to here to the
 

2507
00:45:52,859 --> 00:45:54,410
which is a reduce up to here to the
third face of the cube and that's your

2508
00:45:54,410 --> 00:45:54,420
third face of the cube and that's your
 

2509
00:45:54,420 --> 00:45:55,849
third face of the cube and that's your
multiplied Matrix

2510
00:45:55,849 --> 00:45:55,859
multiplied Matrix
 

2511
00:45:55,859 --> 00:45:58,069
multiplied Matrix
so what a matrix multiply is is a bunch

2512
00:45:58,069 --> 00:45:58,079
so what a matrix multiply is is a bunch
 

2513
00:45:58,079 --> 00:45:59,990
so what a matrix multiply is is a bunch
of shape operations right a bunch of

2514
00:45:59,990 --> 00:46:00,000
of shape operations right a bunch of
 

2515
00:46:00,000 --> 00:46:02,030
of shape operations right a bunch of
permute three shapes and expands on the

2516
00:46:02,030 --> 00:46:02,040
permute three shapes and expands on the
 

2517
00:46:02,040 --> 00:46:03,170
permute three shapes and expands on the
two matrices

2518
00:46:03,170 --> 00:46:03,180
two matrices
 

2519
00:46:03,180 --> 00:46:07,609
two matrices
a multiply n cubed a reduce n cubed

2520
00:46:07,609 --> 00:46:07,619
a multiply n cubed a reduce n cubed
 

2521
00:46:07,619 --> 00:46:09,470
a multiply n cubed a reduce n cubed
which gives you an N squared Matrix

2522
00:46:09,470 --> 00:46:09,480
which gives you an N squared Matrix
 

2523
00:46:09,480 --> 00:46:11,450
which gives you an N squared Matrix
okay so what what is the minimum number

2524
00:46:11,450 --> 00:46:11,460
okay so what what is the minimum number
 

2525
00:46:11,460 --> 00:46:12,950
okay so what what is the minimum number
of operations that can accomplish that

2526
00:46:12,950 --> 00:46:12,960
of operations that can accomplish that
 

2527
00:46:12,960 --> 00:46:15,650
of operations that can accomplish that
if you don't have mapmall as a primitive

2528
00:46:15,650 --> 00:46:15,660
if you don't have mapmall as a primitive
 

2529
00:46:15,660 --> 00:46:18,890
if you don't have mapmall as a primitive
so tiny grad has about 20. and you can

2530
00:46:18,890 --> 00:46:18,900
so tiny grad has about 20. and you can
 

2531
00:46:18,900 --> 00:46:22,550
so tiny grad has about 20. and you can
compare tiny grad's uh opsat or IR to

2532
00:46:22,550 --> 00:46:22,560
compare tiny grad's uh opsat or IR to
 

2533
00:46:22,560 --> 00:46:26,150
compare tiny grad's uh opsat or IR to
things like xla or Prim torch so xla and

2534
00:46:26,150 --> 00:46:26,160
things like xla or Prim torch so xla and
 

2535
00:46:26,160 --> 00:46:27,829
things like xla or Prim torch so xla and
Prim torch are ideas where like okay

2536
00:46:27,829 --> 00:46:27,839
Prim torch are ideas where like okay
 

2537
00:46:27,839 --> 00:46:31,790
Prim torch are ideas where like okay
torch has like 2 000 different kernels

2538
00:46:31,790 --> 00:46:31,800
torch has like 2 000 different kernels
 

2539
00:46:31,800 --> 00:46:34,730
torch has like 2 000 different kernels
um Pi torch 2.0 introduced Prim torch

um I probably could make a perfect or
 

2707
00:49:50,099 --> 00:49:52,010
um I probably could make a perfect or
pretty close to perfect interop layer if

00:52:33,780 --> 00:52:36,530
writing a torch level performance stack
on Nvidia gpus if you can't write a

2858
00:52:36,530 --> 00:52:36,540
on Nvidia gpus if you can't write a
 

2859
00:52:36,540 --> 00:52:38,270
on Nvidia gpus if you can't write a
torch stack on Nvidia gpus and I mean

2860
00:52:38,270 --> 00:52:38,280
torch stack on Nvidia gpus and I mean
 

2861
00:52:38,280 --> 00:52:39,829
torch stack on Nvidia gpus and I mean
all the way I mean down to the driver

2862
00:52:39,829 --> 00:52:39,839
all the way I mean down to the driver
 

2863
00:52:39,839 --> 00:52:40,910
all the way I mean down to the driver
there's no way you're going to be able

2864
00:52:40,910 --> 00:52:40,920
there's no way you're going to be able
 

2865
00:52:40,920 --> 00:52:42,349
there's no way you're going to be able
to write it on your chip because your

2866
00:52:42,349 --> 00:52:42,359
to write it on your chip because your
 

2867
00:52:42,359 --> 00:52:44,510
to write it on your chip because your
Chip's worse than a Nvidia GPU the first

2868
00:52:44,510 --> 00:52:44,520
Chip's worse than a Nvidia GPU the first
 

2869
00:52:44,520 --> 00:52:45,770
Chip's worse than a Nvidia GPU the first
version of the chip you tape out is

2870
00:52:45,770 --> 00:52:45,780
version of the chip you tape out is
 

2871
00:52:45,780 --> 00:52:47,329
version of the chip you tape out is
definitely worse when you're saying

2872
00:52:47,329 --> 00:52:47,339
definitely worse when you're saying
 

2873
00:52:47,339 --> 00:52:49,190
definitely worse when you're saying
writing that stack is really tough yes

2874
00:52:49,190 --> 00:52:49,200
writing that stack is really tough yes
 

2875
00:52:49,200 --> 00:52:50,870
writing that stack is really tough yes
and not only that actually the chip that

2876
00:52:50,870 --> 00:52:50,880
and not only that actually the chip that
 

2877
00:52:50,880 --> 00:52:52,370
and not only that actually the chip that
you tape out almost always because

2878
00:52:52,370 --> 00:52:52,380
you tape out almost always because
 

2879
00:52:52,380 --> 00:52:53,329
you tape out almost always because
you're trying to get advantage over

2880
00:52:53,329 --> 00:52:53,339
you're trying to get advantage over
 

2881
00:52:53,339 --> 00:52:54,829
you're trying to get advantage over
Nvidia you're specializing the hardware

2882
00:52:54,829 --> 00:52:54,839
Nvidia you're specializing the hardware
 

2883
00:52:54,839 --> 00:52:56,990
Nvidia you're specializing the hardware
more it's always harder to write

2884
00:52:56,990 --> 00:52:57,000
more it's always harder to write
 

2885
00:52:57,000 --> 00:52:58,490
more it's always harder to write
software for more specialized Hardware

2886
00:52:58,490 --> 00:52:58,500
software for more specialized Hardware
 

2887
00:52:58,500 --> 00:53:01,069
software for more specialized Hardware
like a GPU is pretty generic and if you

2888
00:53:01,069 --> 00:53:01,079
like a GPU is pretty generic and if you
 

2889
00:53:01,079 --> 00:53:03,170
like a GPU is pretty generic and if you
can't write an Nvidia stack there's no

2890
00:53:03,170 --> 00:53:03,180
can't write an Nvidia stack there's no
 

2891
00:53:03,180 --> 00:53:04,790
can't write an Nvidia stack there's no
way you can write a stack for your chip

2892
00:53:04,790 --> 00:53:04,800
way you can write a stack for your chip
 

2893
00:53:04,800 --> 00:53:07,790
way you can write a stack for your chip
so my Approach with tinygrad is first

2894
00:53:07,790 --> 00:53:07,800
so my Approach with tinygrad is first
 

2895
00:53:07,800 --> 00:53:09,890
so my Approach with tinygrad is first
write a performant Nvidia stack we're

2896
00:53:09,890 --> 00:53:09,900
write a performant Nvidia stack we're
 

2897
00:53:09,900 --> 00:53:11,809
write a performant Nvidia stack we're
targeting AMD

2898
00:53:11,809 --> 00:53:11,819
targeting AMD
 

2899
00:53:11,819 --> 00:53:12,410
targeting AMD
um

2900
00:53:12,410 --> 00:53:12,420
um
 

2901
00:53:12,420 --> 00:53:14,930
um
so you did say a few to Nvidia a little

2902
00:53:14,930 --> 00:53:14,940
so you did say a few to Nvidia a little
 

2903
00:53:14,940 --> 00:53:18,349
so you did say a few to Nvidia a little
bit with love with love yeah so with the

2904
00:53:18,349 --> 00:53:18,359
bit with love with love yeah so with the
 

2905
00:53:18,359 --> 00:53:20,270
bit with love with love yeah so with the
Yankees you know I'm a Mets man oh

2906
00:53:20,270 --> 00:53:20,280
Yankees you know I'm a Mets man oh
 

2907
00:53:20,280 --> 00:53:23,270
Yankees you know I'm a Mets man oh
you're you're a mess fan a risk a risk

2908
00:53:23,270 --> 00:53:23,280
you're you're a mess fan a risk a risk
 

2909
00:53:23,280 --> 00:53:25,130
you're you're a mess fan a risk a risk
fan and a mess fan what's the hope that

2910
00:53:25,130 --> 00:53:25,140
fan and a mess fan what's the hope that
 

2911
00:53:25,140 --> 00:53:28,430
fan and a mess fan what's the hope that
AMG has I mean you did uh build with AMD

2912
00:53:28,430 --> 00:53:28,440
AMG has I mean you did uh build with AMD
 

2913
00:53:28,440 --> 00:53:32,650
AMG has I mean you did uh build with AMD
recently that I saw uh how does the uh

2914
00:53:32,650 --> 00:53:32,660
recently that I saw uh how does the uh
 

2915
00:53:32,660 --> 00:53:37,370
recently that I saw uh how does the uh
the the 7900 xdx compared to the RTX 40

2916
00:53:37,370 --> 00:53:37,380
the the 7900 xdx compared to the RTX 40
 

2917
00:53:37,380 --> 00:53:39,589
the the 7900 xdx compared to the RTX 40
90 or 4080. well let's start with the

2918
00:53:39,589 --> 00:53:39,599
90 or 4080. well let's start with the
 

2919
00:53:39,599 --> 00:53:41,930
90 or 4080. well let's start with the
fact that the 7900 xdx kernel drivers

2920
00:53:41,930 --> 00:53:41,940
fact that the 7900 xdx kernel drivers
 

2921
00:53:41,940 --> 00:53:44,150
fact that the 7900 xdx kernel drivers
don't work and if you run demo apps and

2922
00:53:44,150 --> 00:53:44,160
don't work and if you run demo apps and
 

2923
00:53:44,160 --> 00:53:47,329
don't work and if you run demo apps and
Loops it panics the kernel okay so if

2924
00:53:47,329 --> 00:53:47,339
Loops it panics the kernel okay so if
 

2925
00:53:47,339 --> 00:53:49,130
Loops it panics the kernel okay so if
this is a software issue

2926
00:53:49,130 --> 00:53:49,140
this is a software issue
 

2927
00:53:49,140 --> 00:53:51,890
this is a software issue
Lisa Sue responded to my email oh I

2928
00:53:51,890 --> 00:53:51,900
Lisa Sue responded to my email oh I
 

2929
00:53:51,900 --> 00:53:55,430
Lisa Sue responded to my email oh I
reached out I was like this is you know

2930
00:53:55,430 --> 00:53:55,440
reached out I was like this is you know
 

2931
00:53:55,440 --> 00:53:56,569
reached out I was like this is you know
really

2932
00:53:56,569 --> 00:53:56,579
really
 

2933
00:53:56,579 --> 00:53:59,510
really
like I understand if you're seven by

2934
00:53:59,510 --> 00:53:59,520
like I understand if you're seven by
 

2935
00:53:59,520 --> 00:54:01,670
like I understand if you're seven by
seven transposed win a grad com this

2936
00:54:01,670 --> 00:54:01,680
seven transposed win a grad com this
 

2937
00:54:01,680 --> 00:54:03,890
seven transposed win a grad com this
slower than nvidias but literally when I

2938
00:54:03,890 --> 00:54:03,900
slower than nvidias but literally when I
 

2939
00:54:03,900 --> 00:54:06,470
slower than nvidias but literally when I
run demo apps in a loop the kernel

so just adding that Loop

2944
00:54:10,130 --> 00:54:10,140
so just adding that Loop
 

2945
00:54:10,140 --> 00:54:11,750
so just adding that Loop
yeah I just I just literally took their

2946
00:54:11,750 --> 00:54:11,760
yeah I just I just literally took their
 

2947
00:54:11,760 --> 00:54:13,250
yeah I just I just literally took their
demo apps and wrote like wild true

2948
00:54:13,250 --> 00:54:13,260
demo apps and wrote like wild true
 

2949
00:54:13,260 --> 00:54:16,370
demo apps and wrote like wild true
semicolon do the app semicolon done in a

bunch of screens right this is like like

2952
00:54:18,349 --> 00:54:18,359
bunch of screens right this is like like
 

2953
00:54:18,359 --> 00:54:20,809
bunch of screens right this is like like
the most primitive fuzz testing why do

2954
00:54:20,809 --> 00:54:20,819
the most primitive fuzz testing why do
 

2955
00:54:20,819 --> 00:54:22,549
the most primitive fuzz testing why do
you think that is they're just not

2956
00:54:22,549 --> 00:54:22,559
you think that is they're just not
 

2957
00:54:22,559 --> 00:54:25,609
you think that is they're just not

00:54:28,020 --> 00:54:29,990
learning they're changing they're trying
to change they're trying to change and I

00:54:29,990 --> 00:54:30,000
to change they're trying to change and I
 

2963
00:54:30,000 --> 00:54:31,430

00:54:31,430 --> 00:54:31,440
had a pretty positive interaction with
 

2965
00:54:31,440 --> 00:54:33,049
had a pretty positive interaction with
them this week last week I went on

2966
00:54:33,049 --> 00:54:33,059
them this week last week I went on
 

2967
00:54:33,059 --> 00:54:34,490
them this week last week I went on
YouTube I was just like that's it I give

2968
00:54:34,490 --> 00:54:34,500
YouTube I was just like that's it I give
 

2969
00:54:34,500 --> 00:54:36,589
YouTube I was just like that's it I give
up on AMD like this is their driver

2970
00:54:36,589 --> 00:54:36,599
up on AMD like this is their driver
 

2971
00:54:36,599 --> 00:54:38,329
up on AMD like this is their driver
doesn't like I'm not gonna I'm not gonna

2972
00:54:38,329 --> 00:54:38,339
doesn't like I'm not gonna I'm not gonna
 

2973
00:54:38,339 --> 00:54:41,150
doesn't like I'm not gonna I'm not gonna
you know I'll go with Intel gpus right

2974
00:54:41,150 --> 00:54:41,160
you know I'll go with Intel gpus right
 

2975
00:54:41,160 --> 00:54:44,750
you know I'll go with Intel gpus right
Intel gpus have better drivers

2976
00:54:44,750 --> 00:54:44,760

 

2977
00:54:44,760 --> 00:54:47,450

so you're kind of spearheading the

2978
00:54:47,450 --> 00:54:47,460
so you're kind of spearheading the
 

2979
00:54:47,460 --> 00:54:51,650
so you're kind of spearheading the
diversification of uh gpus yeah and I'd

2980
00:54:51,650 --> 00:54:51,660
diversification of uh gpus yeah and I'd
 

2981
00:54:51,660 --> 00:54:53,030
diversification of uh gpus yeah and I'd
like to extend that diversification to

2982
00:54:53,030 --> 00:54:53,040
like to extend that diversification to
 

2983
00:54:53,040 --> 00:54:56,630
like to extend that diversification to
everything I'd like to diversify the

2984
00:54:56,630 --> 00:54:56,640
everything I'd like to diversify the
 

2985
00:54:56,640 --> 00:54:59,150
everything I'd like to diversify the
right the more

2986
00:54:59,150 --> 00:54:59,160
right the more
 

2987
00:54:59,160 --> 00:55:02,510
right the more
my central thesis about the world is

2988
00:55:02,510 --> 00:55:02,520
my central thesis about the world is
 

2989
00:55:02,520 --> 00:55:04,309
my central thesis about the world is
there's things that centralize power and

2990
00:55:04,309 --> 00:55:04,319
there's things that centralize power and
 

2991
00:55:04,319 --> 00:55:05,630
there's things that centralize power and
they're bad and there's things that

2992
00:55:05,630 --> 00:55:05,640
they're bad and there's things that
 

2993
00:55:05,640 --> 00:55:07,730
they're bad and there's things that
decentralize power and they're good

2994
00:55:07,730 --> 00:55:07,740
decentralize power and they're good
 

2995
00:55:07,740 --> 00:55:09,530
decentralize power and they're good
everything I can do to help decentralize

2996
00:55:09,530 --> 00:55:09,540
everything I can do to help decentralize
 

2997
00:55:09,540 --> 00:55:12,349
everything I can do to help decentralize
power I'd like to do

2998
00:55:12,349 --> 00:55:12,359
power I'd like to do
 

2999
00:55:12,359 --> 00:55:13,609
power I'd like to do
so you're really worried about the

3000
00:55:13,609 --> 00:55:13,619
so you're really worried about the
 

3001
00:55:13,619 --> 00:55:14,870
so you're really worried about the
centralization of Nvidia that's

3002
00:55:14,870 --> 00:55:14,880
centralization of Nvidia that's
 

3003
00:55:14,880 --> 00:55:16,549
centralization of Nvidia that's
interesting and you don't have a

3004
00:55:16,549 --> 00:55:16,559
interesting and you don't have a
 

3005
00:55:16,559 --> 00:55:18,670
interesting and you don't have a
fundamental hope for the the

3006
00:55:18,670 --> 00:55:18,680
fundamental hope for the the
 

3007
00:55:18,680 --> 00:55:20,870
fundamental hope for the the
proliferation of Asics

3008
00:55:20,870 --> 00:55:20,880
proliferation of Asics
 

3009
00:55:20,880 --> 00:55:23,630
proliferation of Asics
uh except in the cloud

3010

uh except in the cloud
I'd like to help them with software no

3012
00:55:25,490 --> 00:55:25,500
I'd like to help them with software no
 

3013
00:55:25,500 --> 00:55:27,349
I'd like to help them with software no
actually there's only the only Asic that

3014
00:55:27,349 --> 00:55:27,359
actually there's only the only Asic that
 

3015
00:55:27,359 --> 00:55:29,390
actually there's only the only Asic that
is remotely successful is Google's TPU

3016
00:55:29,390 --> 00:55:29,400
is remotely successful is Google's TPU
 

3017
00:55:29,400 --> 00:55:31,609
is remotely successful is Google's TPU
and the only reason that's successful is

3018
00:55:31,609 --> 00:55:31,619
and the only reason that's successful is
 

3019
00:55:31,619 --> 00:55:33,890
and the only reason that's successful is
because Google wrote a machine learning

3020
00:55:33,890 --> 00:55:33,900
because Google wrote a machine learning
 

3021
00:55:33,900 --> 00:55:34,730
because Google wrote a machine learning
framework

3022
00:55:34,730 --> 00:55:34,740
framework
 

3023
00:55:34,740 --> 00:55:36,829
framework
I I think that you have to write a

3024
00:55:36,829 --> 00:55:36,839
I I think that you have to write a
 

3025
00:55:36,839 --> 00:55:38,089
I I think that you have to write a
competitive machine learning framework

3026
00:55:38,089 --> 00:55:38,099
competitive machine learning framework
 

3027
00:55:38,099 --> 00:55:40,549
competitive machine learning framework
in order to be able to build an Asic

3028
00:55:40,549 --> 00:55:40,559
in order to be able to build an Asic
 

3029
00:55:40,559 --> 00:55:41,630
in order to be able to build an Asic
um

3030
00:55:41,630 --> 00:55:41,640
um
 

3031
00:55:41,640 --> 00:55:44,150
um
you think meta with biotorch builds a

3032
00:55:44,150 --> 00:55:44,160
you think meta with biotorch builds a
 

3033
00:55:44,160 --> 00:55:46,730
you think meta with biotorch builds a
competitor I hope so okay they have one

the off switch so it's the power to the
 

3053
00:56:03,240 --> 00:56:05,809
the off switch so it's the power to the
people yeah and you don't you don't like

3054
00:56:05,809 --> 00:56:05,819
people yeah and you don't you don't like
 

3055
00:56:05,819 --> 00:56:07,670
people yeah and you don't you don't like
the man to have all the power exactly

00:56:07,670 --> 00:56:07,680
the man to have all the power exactly
 

3057
00:56:07,680 --> 00:56:09,170
the man to have all the power exactly
all right

3058
00:56:09,170 --> 00:56:09,180
all right
 

3059
00:56:09,180 --> 00:56:11,030
all right
and right now the only way to do that is

3060
00:56:11,030 --> 00:56:11,040
and right now the only way to do that is
 

3061
00:56:11,040 --> 00:56:13,309

the best deep learning box that I can
 

3121
00:57:16,800 --> 00:57:19,130
the best deep learning box that I can
that plugs into one wall outlet

3122
00:57:19,130 --> 00:57:19,140
that plugs into one wall outlet
 

3123
00:57:19,140 --> 00:57:20,990
that plugs into one wall outlet
okay can you go through the specs again

3124
00:57:20,990 --> 00:57:21,000
okay can you go through the specs again
 

3125
00:57:21,000 --> 00:57:23,329
okay can you go through the specs again
a little bit from your from memory yeah

3126
00:57:23,329 --> 00:57:23,339
a little bit from your from memory yeah
 

3127
00:57:23,339 --> 00:57:24,950
a little bit from your from memory yeah
so it's almost a paid a flop of compute

3128
00:57:24,950 --> 00:57:24,960
so it's almost a paid a flop of compute
 

3129
00:57:24,960 --> 00:57:28,309
so it's almost a paid a flop of compute
so in D Intel today I'm leaning toward

3130
00:57:28,309 --> 00:57:28,319
so in D Intel today I'm leaning toward
 

3131
00:57:28,319 --> 00:57:30,349
so in D Intel today I'm leaning toward
AMD

um but we're pretty agnostic to the type

3134
00:57:32,210 --> 00:57:32,220
um but we're pretty agnostic to the type
 

3135
00:57:32,220 --> 00:57:33,410
um but we're pretty agnostic to the type
of compute

3136
00:57:33,410 --> 00:57:33,420
of compute
 

3137
00:57:33,420 --> 00:57:38,089

3141
00:57:40,859 --> 00:57:43,010
15 amp circuit
okay well I mean it because in order to

3142
00:57:43,010 --> 00:57:43,020
okay well I mean it because in order to
 

3143
00:57:43,020 --> 00:57:45,049
okay well I mean it because in order to
like like there's a plug over there all

3144
00:57:45,049 --> 00:57:45,059
like like there's a plug over there all
 

3145
00:57:45,059 --> 00:57:49,130
like like there's a plug over there all
right you have to be able to plug it in

3146
00:57:49,130 --> 00:57:49,140
right you have to be able to plug it in
 

3147
00:57:49,140 --> 00:57:50,510
right you have to be able to plug it in
um we're also going to sell the tiny

3148
00:57:50,510 --> 00:57:50,520
um we're also going to sell the tiny
 

3149

no I think status is a narrative you can
construct I I don't think status is real

3328
01:01:18,410 --> 01:01:18,420
construct I I don't think status is real
 

3329
01:01:18,420 --> 01:01:20,630
construct I I don't think status is real
I don't know I just think that that's

3330
01:01:20,630 --> 01:01:20,640
I don't know I just think that that's
 

3331
01:01:20,640 --> 01:01:22,190
I don't know I just think that that's
why it's harder you know yeah maybe it

3332
01:01:22,190 --> 01:01:22,200
why it's harder you know yeah maybe it
 

3333
01:01:22,200 --> 01:01:24,470
why it's harder you know yeah maybe it
is my biases I think status is way

3334
01:01:24,470 --> 01:01:24,480
is my biases I think status is way
 

3335
01:01:24,480 --> 01:01:26,450
is my biases I think status is way
easier to fake I also think that you

3336
01:01:26,450 --> 01:01:26,460
easier to fake I also think that you
 

3337
01:01:26,460 --> 01:01:28,490
easier to fake I also think that you
know men are probably more desperate and

3338
01:01:28,490 --> 01:01:28,500
know men are probably more desperate and
 

3339
01:01:28,500 --> 01:01:29,930
know men are probably more desperate and
more likely to buy my product so maybe

3340
01:01:29,930 --> 01:01:29,940
more likely to buy my product so maybe
 

3341
01:01:29,940 --> 01:01:31,329
more likely to buy my product so maybe
they're a better target market

3342
01:01:31,329 --> 01:01:31,339
they're a better target market
 

3343
01:01:31,339 --> 01:01:34,010
they're a better target market
desperation is interesting easier to

3344
01:01:34,010 --> 01:01:34,020
desperation is interesting easier to
 

3345
01:01:34,020 --> 01:01:36,770
desperation is interesting easier to
fool that's I could I could see that

3346
01:01:36,770 --> 01:01:36,780
fool that's I could I could see that
 

3347
01:01:36,780 --> 01:01:38,270
fool that's I could I could see that
yeah look I mean look I know you can

3348
01:01:38,270 --> 01:01:38,280
yeah look I mean look I know you can
 

3349

yeah yeah I want like 40 45. so how do
 

3413
01:02:53,280 --> 01:02:55,549
yeah yeah I want like 40 45. so how do
you make the cooling uh quiet that's an

3414
01:02:55,549 --> 01:02:55,559
you make the cooling uh quiet that's an
 

3415
01:02:55,559 --> 01:02:57,109
you make the cooling uh quiet that's an
interesting problem in itself

3416
01:02:57,109 --> 01:02:57,119
interesting problem in itself
 

3417
01:02:57,119 --> 01:02:58,370
interesting problem in itself
um a key trick is to actually make it

3418
01:02:58,370 --> 01:02:58,380
um a key trick is to actually make it
 

3419
01:02:58,380 --> 01:03:00,230
um a key trick is to actually make it
big ironically it's called the Tiny Box

3420
01:03:00,230 --> 01:03:00,240
big ironically it's called the Tiny Box
 

3421
01:03:00,240 --> 01:03:02,630
big ironically it's called the Tiny Box
yeah but if I can make it big a lot of

3422
01:03:02,630 --> 01:03:02,640
yeah but if I can make it big a lot of
 

3423
01:03:02,640 --> 01:03:04,789
yeah but if I can make it big a lot of
that noise is generated because of high

3424
01:03:04,789 --> 01:03:04,799
that noise is generated because of high
 

3425
01:03:04,799 --> 01:03:06,650
that noise is generated because of high
pressure air if you look at like a 1u

3426
01:03:06,650 --> 01:03:06,660
pressure air if you look at like a 1u
 

3427
01:03:06,660 --> 01:03:09,230
pressure air if you look at like a 1u
server a 1u server has these super high

3428
01:03:09,230 --> 01:03:09,240
server a 1u server has these super high
 

3429
01:03:09,240 --> 01:03:10,730
server a 1u server has these super high
pressure fans they're like super deep

3430
01:03:10,730 --> 01:03:10,740
pressure fans they're like super deep
 

3431
01:03:10,740 --> 01:03:13,250
pressure fans they're like super deep
and they they're like Janus versus if

3432
01:03:13,250 --> 01:03:13,260
and they they're like Janus versus if
 

3433
01:03:13,260 --> 01:03:15,049
and they they're like Janus versus if
you have something that's big well I can

3434
01:03:15,049 --> 01:03:15,059
you have something that's big well I can
 

3435
01:03:15,059 --> 01:03:16,609
you have something that's big well I can
use a big and you know you know they

3436
01:03:16,609 --> 01:03:16,619
use a big and you know you know they
 

3437
01:03:16,619 --> 01:03:18,230
use a big and you know you know they
call them Big Ass Fans those ones that

3438
01:03:18,230 --> 01:03:18,240
call them Big Ass Fans those ones that
 

3439
01:03:18,240 --> 01:03:20,630
call them Big Ass Fans those ones that
are like huge on the ceiling and they're

3440
01:03:20,630 --> 01:03:20,640
are like huge on the ceiling and they're
 

3441
01:03:20,640 --> 01:03:23,089
are like huge on the ceiling and they're
completely silent so tiny box

3442
01:03:23,089 --> 01:03:23,099
completely silent so tiny box
 

3443
01:03:23,099 --> 01:03:24,530
completely silent so tiny box
will be big

3444
01:03:24,530 --> 01:03:24,540
will be big
 

3445
01:03:24,540 --> 01:03:27,410
will be big
it is the uh I do not want it to be

3446
01:03:27,410 --> 01:03:27,420
it is the uh I do not want it to be
 

3447
01:03:27,420 --> 01:03:29,750
it is the uh I do not want it to be
large according to UPS I want it to be

3448
01:03:29,750 --> 01:03:29,760
large according to UPS I want it to be
 

3449
01:03:29,760 --> 01:03:31,250
large according to UPS I want it to be
shippable as a normal package but that's

3450
01:03:31,250 --> 01:03:31,260
shippable as a normal package but that's
 

3451
01:03:31,260 --> 01:03:32,630
shippable as a normal package but that's
my constraint there

I love it okay and so tiny box would run

3472
01:03:54,650 --> 01:03:54,660
I love it okay and so tiny box would run
 

3473
01:03:54,660 --> 01:03:57,890
I love it okay and so tiny box would run
tiny grad like what what what do you

3474
01:03:57,890 --> 01:03:57,900
tiny grad like what what what do you
 

3475
01:03:57,900 --> 01:03:59,150
tiny grad like what what what do you
envision this whole thing to look like

3476
01:03:59,150 --> 01:03:59,160
envision this whole thing to look like
 

3477
01:03:59,160 --> 01:04:01,450
envision this whole thing to look like
we're talking about like

3478
01:04:01,450 --> 01:04:01,460
we're talking about like
 

3479
01:04:01,460 --> 01:04:04,309
we're talking about like
uh Linux with the full

3480
01:04:04,309 --> 01:04:04,319
uh Linux with the full
 

3481
01:04:04,319 --> 01:04:07,730
uh Linux with the full
software engineering environment

3482
01:04:07,730 --> 01:04:07,740
software engineering environment
 

3483
01:04:07,740 --> 01:04:10,250
software engineering environment
it's just not pie torch but tiny grad

3484
01:04:10,250 --> 01:04:10,260
it's just not pie torch but tiny grad
 

3485
01:04:10,260 --> 01:04:12,410
it's just not pie torch but tiny grad
yeah we did a poll if people want Ubuntu

3486
01:04:12,410 --> 01:04:12,420
yeah we did a poll if people want Ubuntu
 

3487
01:04:12,420 --> 01:04:13,970
yeah we did a poll if people want Ubuntu
or Arch we're going to stick with Ubuntu

3488
01:04:13,970 --> 01:04:13,980
or Arch we're going to stick with Ubuntu
 

3489
01:04:13,980 --> 01:04:16,789
or Arch we're going to stick with Ubuntu
oh interesting what's your favorite uh

3490
01:04:16,789 --> 01:04:16,799
oh interesting what's your favorite uh
 

3491
01:04:16,799 --> 01:04:20,270
oh interesting what's your favorite uh
flavor of Linux Ubuntu I like Ubuntu

3492
01:04:20,270 --> 01:04:20,280
flavor of Linux Ubuntu I like Ubuntu
 

3493
01:04:20,280 --> 01:04:23,809
flavor of Linux Ubuntu I like Ubuntu
mate however you pronounce that meat

3494
01:04:23,809 --> 01:04:23,819
mate however you pronounce that meat
 

3495
01:04:23,819 --> 01:04:26,150
mate however you pronounce that meat
so how do you uh you've gotten llama

3496
01:04:26,150 --> 01:04:26,160
so how do you uh you've gotten llama
 

3497
01:04:26,160 --> 01:04:28,069
so how do you uh you've gotten llama
into tiny grad you've gotten stable

3498
01:04:28,069 --> 01:04:28,079
into tiny grad you've gotten stable
 

3499
01:04:28,079 --> 01:04:29,569
into tiny grad you've gotten stable
diffusion this Italian grind what was

3500
01:04:29,569 --> 01:04:29,579
diffusion this Italian grind what was
 

3501
01:04:29,579 --> 01:04:31,970
diffusion this Italian grind what was
that like can you comment on like what

3502
01:04:31,970 --> 01:04:31,980
that like can you comment on like what
 

3503
01:04:31,980 --> 01:04:33,049
that like can you comment on like what
are

3504
01:04:33,049 --> 01:04:33,059
are
 

3505
01:04:33,059 --> 01:04:34,789
are
um what are these models what's

3506
01:04:34,789 --> 01:04:34,799
um what are these models what's
 

3507
01:04:34,799 --> 01:04:37,069
um what are these models what's
interesting about putting them up so

3508
01:04:37,069 --> 01:04:37,079
interesting about putting them up so
 

3509
01:04:37,079 --> 01:04:38,809
interesting about putting them up so
what's yeah like what what are the the

3510
01:04:38,809 --> 01:04:38,819
what's yeah like what what are the the
 

3511
01:04:38,819 --> 01:04:40,789
what's yeah like what what are the the
challenges with what's naturally what's

3512
01:04:40,789 --> 01:04:40,799
challenges with what's naturally what's
 

3513
01:04:40,799 --> 01:04:42,530
challenges with what's naturally what's
easy all that kind of stuff there's a

3514
01:04:42,530 --> 01:04:42,540
easy all that kind of stuff there's a
 

3515
01:04:42,540 --> 01:04:43,970
easy all that kind of stuff there's a
really simple way to get these models

3516
01:04:43,970 --> 01:04:43,980
really simple way to get these models
 

3517
01:04:43,980 --> 01:04:45,470
really simple way to get these models
into tiny grad and you can just export

3518
01:04:45,470 --> 01:04:45,480
into tiny grad and you can just export
 

3519
01:04:45,480 --> 01:04:47,450
into tiny grad and you can just export
them as Onyx and then tiny grad can run

3520
01:04:47,450 --> 01:04:47,460
them as Onyx and then tiny grad can run
 

3521
01:04:47,460 --> 01:04:49,010
them as Onyx and then tiny grad can run
onyx

3522
01:04:49,010 --> 01:04:49,020
onyx
 

3523
01:04:49,020 --> 01:04:51,470
onyx
um so the ports that I did of llama

3524
01:04:51,470 --> 01:04:51,480
um so the ports that I did of llama
 

3525
01:04:51,480 --> 01:04:53,690
um so the ports that I did of llama
stable diffusion and now whisper are

3526
01:04:53,690 --> 01:04:53,700
stable diffusion and now whisper are
 

3527
01:04:53,700 --> 01:04:55,549
stable diffusion and now whisper are
more academic to teach me about the

3528
01:04:55,549 --> 01:04:55,559
more academic to teach me about the
 

3529
01:04:55,559 --> 01:04:57,770
more academic to teach me about the
models but they are cleaner than the

3530
01:04:57,770 --> 01:04:57,780
models but they are cleaner than the
 

3531
01:04:57,780 --> 01:04:59,930
models but they are cleaner than the
pytorch versions you can read the code I

3532
01:04:59,930 --> 01:04:59,940
pytorch versions you can read the code I
 

3533
01:04:59,940 --> 01:05:01,549
pytorch versions you can read the code I
think the code is easier to read it's

3534
01:05:01,549 --> 01:05:01,559
think the code is easier to read it's
 

3535
01:05:01,559 --> 01:05:03,770
think the code is easier to read it's
less lines there's just a few things

3536
01:05:03,770 --> 01:05:03,780
less lines there's just a few things
 

3537
01:05:03,780 --> 01:05:05,329
less lines there's just a few things
about the way tiny grid writes things

3538
01:05:05,329 --> 01:05:05,339
about the way tiny grid writes things
 

3539
01:05:05,339 --> 01:05:06,650
about the way tiny grid writes things
here's here's a complaint I have about

3540
01:05:06,650 --> 01:05:06,660
here's here's a complaint I have about
 

3541
01:05:06,660 --> 01:05:08,109
here's here's a complaint I have about
pytorch

3542
01:05:08,109 --> 01:05:08,119
pytorch
 

3543
01:05:08,119 --> 01:05:10,250
pytorch
nn.relu is a class

3544
01:05:10,250 --> 01:05:10,260
nn.relu is a class
 

3545
01:05:10,260 --> 01:05:11,870
nn.relu is a class
right so when you create it when you

3546
01:05:11,870 --> 01:05:11,880
right so when you create it when you
 

3547
01:05:11,880 --> 01:05:14,150
right so when you create it when you
create an end module you'll put your nn

3548
01:05:14,150 --> 01:05:14,160
create an end module you'll put your nn
 

3549
01:05:14,160 --> 01:05:15,650
create an end module you'll put your nn
relues

3550
01:05:15,650 --> 01:05:15,660
relues
 

3551
01:05:15,660 --> 01:05:18,710
relues
as in init and this makes no sense value

3552
01:05:18,710 --> 01:05:18,720
as in init and this makes no sense value
 

3553
01:05:18,720 --> 01:05:20,510
as in init and this makes no sense value
is completely stateless

3554
01:05:20,510 --> 01:05:20,520
is completely stateless
 

3555
01:05:20,520 --> 01:05:22,970
is completely stateless
why should that be a class

3556
01:05:22,970 --> 01:05:22,980
why should that be a class
 

3557
01:05:22,980 --> 01:05:24,950
why should that be a class
but that's more like a software

3558
01:05:24,950 --> 01:05:24,960
but that's more like a software
 

3559
01:05:24,960 --> 01:05:26,750
but that's more like a software
engineering thing or do you think it has

3560
01:05:26,750 --> 01:05:26,760
engineering thing or do you think it has
 

3561
01:05:26,760 --> 01:05:28,609
engineering thing or do you think it has
a cost on performance oh no it doesn't

3562
01:05:28,609 --> 01:05:28,619
a cost on performance oh no it doesn't
 

3563
01:05:28,619 --> 01:05:30,349
a cost on performance oh no it doesn't
have a Custom Performance

3564
01:05:30,349 --> 01:05:30,359
have a Custom Performance
 

3565
01:05:30,359 --> 01:05:32,270
have a Custom Performance
um but yeah no I think that it it's

3566
01:05:32,270 --> 01:05:32,280
um but yeah no I think that it it's
 

3567
01:05:32,280 --> 01:05:33,770
um but yeah no I think that it it's
that's what I mean about like tiny

3568
01:05:33,770 --> 01:05:33,780
that's what I mean about like tiny
 

3569
01:05:33,780 --> 01:05:36,530
that's what I mean about like tiny
grad's front end to being cleaner I see

3570
01:05:36,530 --> 01:05:36,540
grad's front end to being cleaner I see
 

3571
01:05:36,540 --> 01:05:38,510
grad's front end to being cleaner I see
uh what do you think about Mojo I don't

3572
01:05:38,510 --> 01:05:38,520
uh what do you think about Mojo I don't
 

3573
01:05:38,520 --> 01:05:39,589
uh what do you think about Mojo I don't
know if you've been paying attention to

3574
01:05:39,589 --> 01:05:39,599
know if you've been paying attention to
 

3575
01:05:39,599 --> 01:05:42,109
know if you've been paying attention to
the programming language that does

3576
01:05:42,109 --> 01:05:42,119
the programming language that does
 

3577
01:05:42,119 --> 01:05:43,789
the programming language that does
um some interesting ideas that kind of

3578
01:05:43,789 --> 01:05:43,799
um some interesting ideas that kind of
 

3579
01:05:43,799 --> 01:05:46,789
um some interesting ideas that kind of
intersect uh tiny grad I think that

3580
01:05:46,789 --> 01:05:46,799
intersect uh tiny grad I think that
 

3581
01:05:46,799 --> 01:05:49,250
intersect uh tiny grad I think that
there is a spectrum and like on one side

3582
01:05:49,250 --> 01:05:49,260
there is a spectrum and like on one side
 

3583
01:05:49,260 --> 01:05:50,809
there is a spectrum and like on one side
you have Mojo and on the other side you

3584
01:05:50,809 --> 01:05:50,819
you have Mojo and on the other side you
 

3585
01:05:50,819 --> 01:05:52,549
you have Mojo and on the other side you
have like ggml

3586
01:05:52,549 --> 01:05:52,559
have like ggml
 

3587
01:05:52,559 --> 01:05:54,589
have like ggml
um gml is this like we're going to run

3588
01:05:54,589 --> 01:05:54,599
um gml is this like we're going to run
 

3589
01:05:54,599 --> 01:05:57,289
um gml is this like we're going to run
llama fast on Mac and okay we're going

3590
01:05:57,289 --> 01:05:57,299
llama fast on Mac and okay we're going
 

3591
01:05:57,299 --> 01:05:58,370
llama fast on Mac and okay we're going
to expand out to a little bit but we're

3592
01:05:58,370 --> 01:05:58,380
to expand out to a little bit but we're
 

3593
01:05:58,380 --> 01:05:59,870
to expand out to a little bit but we're
going to basically like depth first

3594
01:05:59,870 --> 01:05:59,880
going to basically like depth first
 

3595
01:05:59,880 --> 01:06:02,569
going to basically like depth first
right Mojo is like we're gonna go breath

3596
01:06:02,569 --> 01:06:02,579
right Mojo is like we're gonna go breath
 

3597
01:06:02,579 --> 01:06:04,250
right Mojo is like we're gonna go breath
first we're gonna go so wide that we're

3598
01:06:04,250 --> 01:06:04,260
first we're gonna go so wide that we're
 

3599
01:06:04,260 --> 01:06:06,410
first we're gonna go so wide that we're
gonna make all of python fast and Tiny

3600
01:06:06,410 --> 01:06:06,420
gonna make all of python fast and Tiny
 

3601
01:06:06,420 --> 01:06:08,589
gonna make all of python fast and Tiny
grads in the middle

3602
01:06:08,589 --> 01:06:08,599
grads in the middle
 

3603
01:06:08,599 --> 01:06:10,910
grads in the middle
we are going to make neural networks

3604
01:06:10,910 --> 01:06:10,920
we are going to make neural networks
 

3605
01:06:10,920 --> 01:06:12,410
we are going to make neural networks
fast

3606
01:06:12,410 --> 01:06:12,420
fast
 

3607
01:06:12,420 --> 01:06:16,490
fast
yeah but they uh they try to really get

3608
01:06:16,490 --> 01:06:16,500
yeah but they uh they try to really get
 

3609
01:06:16,500 --> 01:06:18,710
yeah but they uh they try to really get
it to be fast compiled down to the

3610
01:06:18,710 --> 01:06:18,720
it to be fast compiled down to the
 

3611
01:06:18,720 --> 01:06:21,589
it to be fast compiled down to the
specifics uh hardware and make that

3612
01:06:21,589 --> 01:06:21,599
specifics uh hardware and make that
 

3613
01:06:21,599 --> 01:06:23,390
specifics uh hardware and make that
compilation step

3614
01:06:23,390 --> 01:06:23,400
compilation step
 

3615
01:06:23,400 --> 01:06:25,789
compilation step
as flexible and resilient as possible

3616
01:06:25,789 --> 01:06:25,799
as flexible and resilient as possible
 

3617
01:06:25,799 --> 01:06:27,829
as flexible and resilient as possible
yeah but they've turned completeness

3618
01:06:27,829 --> 01:06:27,839
yeah but they've turned completeness
 

3619
01:06:27,839 --> 01:06:29,450
yeah but they've turned completeness
and that limits you

3620
01:06:29,450 --> 01:06:29,460
and that limits you
 

3621
01:06:29,460 --> 01:06:30,890
and that limits you
Charlie that's what you're seeing is

3622
01:06:30,890 --> 01:06:30,900
Charlie that's what you're seeing is
 

3623
01:06:30,900 --> 01:06:32,210
Charlie that's what you're seeing is
somewhere in the middle so you're

3624
01:06:32,210 --> 01:06:32,220
somewhere in the middle so you're
 

3625
01:06:32,220 --> 01:06:33,770
somewhere in the middle so you're
actually going to be targeting some

3626
01:06:33,770 --> 01:06:33,780
actually going to be targeting some
 

3627
01:06:33,780 --> 01:06:36,230
actually going to be targeting some

01:06:51,349 --> 01:06:51,359
okay how do we make an accelerator right
 

3639
01:06:51,359 --> 01:06:53,270
okay how do we make an accelerator right
but you need step one you have to first

so I'm much more of a like
 

3653
01:07:06,539 --> 01:07:08,930
so I'm much more of a like
build it the right way and worry about

3654
01:07:08,930 --> 01:07:08,940
build it the right way and worry about
 

3655
01:07:08,940 --> 01:07:11,210
build it the right way and worry about
performance later

uh so you have you know companies like
 

3769
01:09:14,100 --> 01:09:15,709
uh so you have you know companies like
women Cruise which are hand coding these

01:09:34,130 --> 01:09:34,140
we just put it out on Twitter
 

3787
01:09:34,140 --> 01:09:36,530
we just put it out on Twitter
at the beginning of comma

3788
01:09:36,530 --> 01:09:36,540
at the beginning of comma
 

3789
01:09:36,540 --> 01:09:38,030
at the beginning of comma
we published a paper

3790
01:09:38,030 --> 01:09:38,040
we published a paper
 

3791
01:09:38,040 --> 01:09:40,070
we published a paper
called learning a driving simulator

3792
01:09:40,070 --> 01:09:40,080
called learning a driving simulator
 

3793
01:09:40,080 --> 01:09:43,430
called learning a driving simulator
and the way this thing worked was it's a

3794
01:09:43,430 --> 01:09:43,440
and the way this thing worked was it's a
 

3795
01:09:43,440 --> 01:09:45,470
and the way this thing worked was it's a
it was an auto encoder

3796
01:09:45,470 --> 01:09:45,480
it was an auto encoder
 

3797
01:09:45,480 --> 01:09:48,530
it was an auto encoder
and then an RNN in the middle right uh

3798
01:09:48,530 --> 01:09:48,540
and then an RNN in the middle right uh
 

3799
01:09:48,540 --> 01:09:50,749
and then an RNN in the middle right uh
you take an auto encoder you compress

3800
01:09:50,749 --> 01:09:50,759
you take an auto encoder you compress
 

3801
01:09:50,759 --> 01:09:52,910
you take an auto encoder you compress
the picture you use an RNN predict the

3802
01:09:52,910 --> 01:09:52,920
the picture you use an RNN predict the
 

3803
01:09:52,920 --> 01:09:55,610
the picture you use an RNN predict the
next date and these things were you know

3804
01:09:55,610 --> 01:09:55,620
next date and these things were you know
 

3805
01:09:55,620 --> 01:09:57,290
next date and these things were you know
it was a laughingly bad simulator right

3806
01:09:57,290 --> 01:09:57,300
it was a laughingly bad simulator right
 

3807
01:09:57,300 --> 01:09:59,270
it was a laughingly bad simulator right
this is 2015 error machine learning

3808
01:09:59,270 --> 01:09:59,280
this is 2015 error machine learning
 

3809
01:09:59,280 --> 01:10:00,290
this is 2015 error machine learning
technology

3810
01:10:00,290 --> 01:10:00,300
technology
 

3811
01:10:00,300 --> 01:10:03,310
technology
today we have vqvae and Transformers

3812
01:10:03,310 --> 01:10:03,320
today we have vqvae and Transformers
 

3813
01:10:03,320 --> 01:10:06,709
today we have vqvae and Transformers
we're building Drive GPT basically

3814
01:10:06,709 --> 01:10:06,719
we're building Drive GPT basically
 

3815
01:10:06,719 --> 01:10:10,250
we're building Drive GPT basically
Drive GPT okay uh

3816
01:10:10,250 --> 01:10:10,260
Drive GPT okay uh
 

3817
01:10:10,260 --> 01:10:12,650
Drive GPT okay uh
so and that's trained on what is it

3818
01:10:12,650 --> 01:10:12,660
so and that's trained on what is it
 

3819
01:10:12,660 --> 01:10:14,990
so and that's trained on what is it
trained in a self-supervised way it's

3820
01:10:14,990 --> 01:10:15,000
trained in a self-supervised way it's
 

3821
01:10:15,000 --> 01:10:16,370
trained in a self-supervised way it's
trained on all the driving data to

3822
01:10:16,370 --> 01:10:16,380
trained on all the driving data to
 

3823
01:10:16,380 --> 01:10:18,470
trained on all the driving data to
predict the next frame so really trying

3824
01:10:18,470 --> 01:10:18,480
predict the next frame so really trying
 

3825
01:10:18,480 --> 01:10:21,350
predict the next frame so really trying
to uh learn a human policy what would a

3826
01:10:21,350 --> 01:10:21,360
to uh learn a human policy what would a
 

3827
01:10:21,360 --> 01:10:23,330
to uh learn a human policy what would a
human do well actually our simulator is

3828
01:10:23,330 --> 01:10:23,340
human do well actually our simulator is
 

3829
01:10:23,340 --> 01:10:24,830
human do well actually our simulator is
conditioned on the pose so it's actually

3830
01:10:24,830 --> 01:10:24,840
conditioned on the pose so it's actually
 

3831
01:10:24,840 --> 01:10:26,510
conditioned on the pose so it's actually
a simulator you can put in like a state

3832
01:10:26,510 --> 01:10:26,520
a simulator you can put in like a state
 

3833
01:10:26,520 --> 01:10:28,669
a simulator you can put in like a state
action pair and get out the next date

3834
01:10:28,669 --> 01:10:28,679
action pair and get out the next date
 

3835
01:10:28,679 --> 01:10:29,930
action pair and get out the next date
okay

3836
01:10:29,930 --> 01:10:29,940
okay
 

3837
01:10:29,940 --> 01:10:31,550
okay
um and then once you have a simulator

3838
01:10:31,550 --> 01:10:31,560
um and then once you have a simulator
 

3839
01:10:31,560 --> 01:10:34,729
um and then once you have a simulator
you can do RL in the simulator and RL

3840
01:10:34,729 --> 01:10:34,739
you can do RL in the simulator and RL
 

3841
01:10:34,739 --> 01:10:36,770
you can do RL in the simulator and RL
will get us that human policy

3842
01:10:36,770 --> 01:10:36,780
will get us that human policy
 

3843
01:10:36,780 --> 01:10:39,649
will get us that human policy
so it transfers yeah

3844
01:10:39,649 --> 01:10:39,659
so it transfers yeah
 

3845
01:10:39,659 --> 01:10:42,770
so it transfers yeah
RL with a reward function not asking is

3846
01:10:42,770 --> 01:10:42,780
RL with a reward function not asking is
 

3847
01:10:42,780 --> 01:10:44,030
RL with a reward function not asking is
this close to the human policy but

3848
01:10:44,030 --> 01:10:44,040
this close to the human policy but
 

3849
01:10:44,040 --> 01:10:45,530
this close to the human policy but
asking would a human disengage if you

3850
01:10:45,530 --> 01:10:45,540
asking would a human disengage if you
 

3851
01:10:45,540 --> 01:10:46,870
asking would a human disengage if you
did this Behavior

3852
01:10:46,870 --> 01:10:46,880
did this Behavior
 

3853
01:10:46,880 --> 01:10:49,790
did this Behavior
okay let me think about the distinction

3854
01:10:49,790 --> 01:10:49,800
okay let me think about the distinction
 

3855
01:10:49,800 --> 01:10:52,790
okay let me think about the distinction
there would a human disengage

3856
01:10:52,790 --> 01:10:52,800
there would a human disengage
 

3857
01:10:52,800 --> 01:10:54,770
there would a human disengage
what a human disengage

3858
01:10:54,770 --> 01:10:54,780
what a human disengage
 

3859
01:10:54,780 --> 01:10:56,750
what a human disengage
that um

3860
01:10:56,750 --> 01:10:56,760
that um
 

3861
01:10:56,760 --> 01:10:58,910
that um
correlates I guess with the human policy

3862
01:10:58,910 --> 01:10:58,920
correlates I guess with the human policy
 

3863
01:10:58,920 --> 01:11:01,310
correlates I guess with the human policy
but it could be different so it's it uh

3864
01:11:01,310 --> 01:11:01,320
but it could be different so it's it uh
 

3865
01:11:01,320 --> 01:11:03,290
but it could be different so it's it uh
it doesn't just say what would a human

3866
01:11:03,290 --> 01:11:03,300
it doesn't just say what would a human
 

3867
01:11:03,300 --> 01:11:05,570
it doesn't just say what would a human
do it says what would a good human

3868
01:11:05,570 --> 01:11:05,580
do it says what would a good human
 

3869
01:11:05,580 --> 01:11:08,810
do it says what would a good human
driver do and such that the experience

3870
01:11:08,810 --> 01:11:08,820
driver do and such that the experience
 

3871
01:11:08,820 --> 01:11:10,490
driver do and such that the experience
is comfortable

3872
01:11:10,490 --> 01:11:10,500
is comfortable
 

3873
01:11:10,500 --> 01:11:12,830
is comfortable
but also not annoying in that like the

3874
01:11:12,830 --> 01:11:12,840
but also not annoying in that like the
 

3875
01:11:12,840 --> 01:11:14,570
but also not annoying in that like the
thing is very cautious

3876
01:11:14,570 --> 01:11:14,580
thing is very cautious
 

3877
01:11:14,580 --> 01:11:16,490
thing is very cautious
so it's finding a nice balance that's

3878
01:11:16,490 --> 01:11:16,500
so it's finding a nice balance that's
 

3879
01:11:16,500 --> 01:11:18,110
so it's finding a nice balance that's
that's interesting it's a nice okay

3880
01:11:18,110 --> 01:11:18,120
that's interesting it's a nice okay
 

3881
01:11:18,120 --> 01:11:20,510
that's interesting it's a nice okay
tasking exactly the right question what

3882
01:11:20,510 --> 01:11:20,520
tasking exactly the right question what
 

3883
01:11:20,520 --> 01:11:22,850
tasking exactly the right question what
will make our customers happy

3884
01:11:22,850 --> 01:11:22,860
will make our customers happy
 

3885
01:11:22,860 --> 01:11:24,709
will make our customers happy
right A system that you never want to

3886
01:11:24,709 --> 01:11:24,719
right A system that you never want to
 

3887
01:11:24,719 --> 01:11:26,330
right A system that you never want to
disengage because usually this

3888
01:11:26,330 --> 01:11:26,340
disengage because usually this
 

3889
01:11:26,340 --> 01:11:29,750
disengage because usually this
engagement is this almost always a sign

3890
01:11:29,750 --> 01:11:29,760
engagement is this almost always a sign
 

3891
01:11:29,760 --> 01:11:31,729
engagement is this almost always a sign
of I'm not happy with what the system is

3892
01:11:31,729 --> 01:11:31,739
of I'm not happy with what the system is
 

3893
01:11:31,739 --> 01:11:33,830
of I'm not happy with what the system is
doing usually um there's some that are

3894
01:11:33,830 --> 01:11:33,840
doing usually um there's some that are
 

3895
01:11:33,840 --> 01:11:35,689
doing usually um there's some that are
just I felt like driving and those are

3896
01:11:35,689 --> 01:11:35,699
just I felt like driving and those are
 

3897
01:11:35,699 --> 01:11:37,070
just I felt like driving and those are
always fine too but they're just going

3898
01:11:37,070 --> 01:11:37,080
always fine too but they're just going
 

3899
01:11:37,080 --> 01:11:39,110
always fine too but they're just going
to look like noise in the data

3900
01:11:39,110 --> 01:11:39,120
to look like noise in the data
 

3901
01:11:39,120 --> 01:11:41,390
to look like noise in the data
but even that felt like driving

3902
01:11:41,390 --> 01:11:41,400
but even that felt like driving
 

3903
01:11:41,400 --> 01:11:43,790
but even that felt like driving
maybe yeah that's even that's a signal

3904
01:11:43,790 --> 01:11:43,800
maybe yeah that's even that's a signal
 

3905
01:11:43,800 --> 01:11:45,530
maybe yeah that's even that's a signal
like why do you feel like driving

3906
01:11:45,530 --> 01:11:45,540
like why do you feel like driving
 

3907
01:11:45,540 --> 01:11:48,370
like why do you feel like driving
here you need to

3908
01:11:48,370 --> 01:11:48,380
here you need to
 

3909
01:11:48,380 --> 01:11:50,810
here you need to
re-calibrate your relationship with the

3910
01:11:50,810 --> 01:11:50,820
re-calibrate your relationship with the
 

3911
01:11:50,820 --> 01:11:52,790
re-calibrate your relationship with the
car okay so what that that's really

3912
01:11:52,790 --> 01:11:52,800
car okay so what that that's really
 

3913
01:11:52,800 --> 01:11:54,169
car okay so what that that's really
interesting

3914
01:11:54,169 --> 01:11:54,179
interesting
 

3915
01:11:54,179 --> 01:11:55,550
interesting
um how close are we just solving

3916
01:11:55,550 --> 01:11:55,560
um how close are we just solving
 

3917
01:11:55,560 --> 01:11:57,649
um how close are we just solving
self-driving

3918
01:11:57,649 --> 01:11:57,659
self-driving
 

3919
01:11:57,659 --> 01:11:59,270
self-driving
um

3920
01:11:59,270 --> 01:11:59,280
um
 

3921
01:11:59,280 --> 01:12:00,890
um
it's hard to say

3922
01:12:00,890 --> 01:12:00,900
it's hard to say
 

3923
01:12:00,900 --> 01:12:03,229
it's hard to say
we haven't completely closed the loop

3924
01:12:03,229 --> 01:12:03,239
we haven't completely closed the loop
 

3925
01:12:03,239 --> 01:12:05,270
we haven't completely closed the loop
yet so we don't have anything built that

3926
01:12:05,270 --> 01:12:05,280
yet so we don't have anything built that
 

3927
01:12:05,280 --> 01:12:06,709
yet so we don't have anything built that
truly looks like that architecture yet

3928
01:12:06,709 --> 01:12:06,719
truly looks like that architecture yet
 

3929
01:12:06,719 --> 01:12:10,189
truly looks like that architecture yet
we have prototypes and there's bugs

3930
01:12:10,189 --> 01:12:10,199
we have prototypes and there's bugs
 

3931
01:12:10,199 --> 01:12:12,470
we have prototypes and there's bugs
um so we are a couple bug fixes away

3932
01:12:12,470 --> 01:12:12,480
um so we are a couple bug fixes away
 

3933
01:12:12,480 --> 01:12:15,470
um so we are a couple bug fixes away
might take a year might take 10. what's

3934
01:12:15,470 --> 01:12:15,480
might take a year might take 10. what's
 

3935
01:12:15,480 --> 01:12:18,169
might take a year might take 10. what's
the nature of the bugs are these uh

3936
01:12:18,169 --> 01:12:18,179
the nature of the bugs are these uh
 

3937
01:12:18,179 --> 01:12:20,630
the nature of the bugs are these uh
these major philosophical bugs logical

3938
01:12:20,630 --> 01:12:20,640
these major philosophical bugs logical
 

3939
01:12:20,640 --> 01:12:22,189
these major philosophical bugs logical
bugs what kind of what kind of bugs are

3940
01:12:22,189 --> 01:12:22,199
bugs what kind of what kind of bugs are
 

3941
01:12:22,199 --> 01:12:23,270
bugs what kind of what kind of bugs are
we talking about oh they're just like

3942
01:12:23,270 --> 01:12:23,280
we talking about oh they're just like
 

3943
01:12:23,280 --> 01:12:24,830
we talking about oh they're just like
they're just like stupid bugs and like

3944
01:12:24,830 --> 01:12:24,840
they're just like stupid bugs and like
 

3945
01:12:24,840 --> 01:12:26,750
they're just like stupid bugs and like
also we might just need more scale

3946
01:12:26,750 --> 01:12:26,760
also we might just need more scale
 

3947
01:12:26,760 --> 01:12:28,610
also we might just need more scale
um we just massively expanded our

3948
01:12:28,610 --> 01:12:28,620
um we just massively expanded our
 

3949
01:12:28,620 --> 01:12:31,790
um we just massively expanded our
compute cluster a comma uh we now have

3950
01:12:31,790 --> 01:12:31,800
compute cluster a comma uh we now have
 

3951
01:12:31,800 --> 01:12:34,070
compute cluster a comma uh we now have
about two people worth of compute 40 pad

3952
01:12:34,070 --> 01:12:34,080
about two people worth of compute 40 pad
 

3953
01:12:34,080 --> 01:12:35,470
about two people worth of compute 40 pad
of flaps

3954
01:12:35,470 --> 01:12:35,480
of flaps
 

3955
01:12:35,480 --> 01:12:39,169
of flaps
well people people are different

3956
01:12:39,169 --> 01:12:39,179
well people people are different
 

3957
01:12:39,179 --> 01:12:41,209
well people people are different
I have 20 fade flops that's a person I

3958
01:12:41,209 --> 01:12:41,219
I have 20 fade flops that's a person I
 

3959
01:12:41,219 --> 01:12:42,290
I have 20 fade flops that's a person I
mean it's just it's just a unit right

3960
01:12:42,290 --> 01:12:42,300
mean it's just it's just a unit right
 

3961
01:12:42,300 --> 01:12:43,610
mean it's just it's just a unit right
horses are different too but we still

3962
01:12:43,610 --> 01:12:43,620
horses are different too but we still
 

3963
01:12:43,620 --> 01:12:44,870
horses are different too but we still
call it a horsepower

3964
01:12:44,870 --> 01:12:44,880
call it a horsepower
 

3965
01:12:44,880 --> 01:12:46,430
call it a horsepower
yeah but there's something different

3966
01:12:46,430 --> 01:12:46,440
yeah but there's something different
 

3967
01:12:46,440 --> 01:12:49,070
yeah but there's something different
about Mobility than there is about

3968
01:12:49,070 --> 01:12:49,080
about Mobility than there is about
 

3969
01:12:49,080 --> 01:12:51,830
about Mobility than there is about
uh perception of action in a very

3970
01:12:51,830 --> 01:12:51,840
uh perception of action in a very
 

3971
01:12:51,840 --> 01:12:54,410
uh perception of action in a very
complicated world but yes well yeah of

3972
01:12:54,410 --> 01:12:54,420
complicated world but yes well yeah of
 

3973
01:12:54,420 --> 01:12:55,669
complicated world but yes well yeah of
course not all flops are created equal

3974
01:12:55,669 --> 01:12:55,679
course not all flops are created equal
 

3975
01:12:55,679 --> 01:12:57,290
course not all flops are created equal
if you have randomly initialized weights

3976
01:12:57,290 --> 01:12:57,300
if you have randomly initialized weights
 

3977
01:12:57,300 --> 01:12:58,310
if you have randomly initialized weights
it's not gonna

3978
01:12:58,310 --> 01:12:58,320
it's not gonna
 

3979
01:12:58,320 --> 01:13:00,770
it's not gonna
not all flops are created equal so

3980
01:13:00,770 --> 01:13:00,780
not all flops are created equal so
 

3981
01:13:00,780 --> 01:13:02,330
not all flops are created equal so
they're doing way more useful things

3982
01:13:02,330 --> 01:13:02,340
they're doing way more useful things
 

3983
01:13:02,340 --> 01:13:06,169
they're doing way more useful things
than others yeah yep tell me about it

3984
01:13:06,169 --> 01:13:06,179
than others yeah yep tell me about it
 

3985
01:13:06,179 --> 01:13:08,810
than others yeah yep tell me about it
okay so more data scale means more

3986
01:13:08,810 --> 01:13:08,820
okay so more data scale means more
 

3987
01:13:08,820 --> 01:13:10,970
okay so more data scale means more
scaling computer or scale and scale of

3988
01:13:10,970 --> 01:13:10,980
scaling computer or scale and scale of
 

3989
01:13:10,980 --> 01:13:14,470
scaling computer or scale and scale of
data both

3990
01:13:14,470 --> 01:13:14,480

 

3991
01:13:14,480 --> 01:13:16,790

diversity of data diversity is very

3992
01:13:16,790 --> 01:13:16,800
diversity of data diversity is very
 

3993
01:13:16,800 --> 01:13:20,450
diversity of data diversity is very
important in data uh yeah I mean we have

3994
01:13:20,450 --> 01:13:20,460
important in data uh yeah I mean we have
 

3995
01:13:20,460 --> 01:13:23,330
important in data uh yeah I mean we have
so we have about I think we have like 5

3996
01:13:23,330 --> 01:13:23,340
so we have about I think we have like 5
 

3997
01:13:23,340 --> 01:13:25,430
so we have about I think we have like 5

how would you evaluate how uh FSD is

4000
01:13:28,189 --> 01:13:28,199
how would you evaluate how uh FSD is
 

4001
01:13:28,199 --> 01:13:30,950
how would you evaluate how uh FSD is
doing pretty much driving pretty well

4002
01:13:30,950 --> 01:13:30,960
doing pretty much driving pretty well
 

4003
01:13:30,960 --> 01:13:33,890
doing pretty much driving pretty well
how's that race gone between calm Ai and

4004
01:13:33,890 --> 01:13:33,900
how's that race gone between calm Ai and
 

4005
01:13:33,900 --> 01:13:35,689
how's that race gone between calm Ai and
FSD Tesla has always wanted two years

4006
01:13:35,689 --> 01:13:35,699
FSD Tesla has always wanted two years
 

4007
01:13:35,699 --> 01:13:37,070
FSD Tesla has always wanted two years
ahead of us they've always been one to

4008
01:13:37,070 --> 01:13:37,080
ahead of us they've always been one to
 

4009
01:13:37,080 --> 01:13:38,810
ahead of us they've always been one to
two years ahead of us and they probably

4010
01:13:38,810 --> 01:13:38,820
two years ahead of us and they probably
 

4011
01:13:38,820 --> 01:13:39,950
two years ahead of us and they probably
always will be because they're not doing

4012
01:13:39,950 --> 01:13:39,960
always will be because they're not doing
 

4013
01:13:39,960 --> 01:13:41,390
always will be because they're not doing
anything wrong

4014
01:13:41,390 --> 01:13:41,400
anything wrong
 

4015
01:13:41,400 --> 01:13:43,310
anything wrong
what have you seen that's since the last

4016
01:13:43,310 --> 01:13:43,320
what have you seen that's since the last
 

4017
01:13:43,320 --> 01:13:44,330
what have you seen that's since the last
time we talked that are interesting

4018
01:13:44,330 --> 01:13:44,340
time we talked that are interesting
 

4019
01:13:44,340 --> 01:13:45,890
time we talked that are interesting
architectural decisions training

4020
01:13:45,890 --> 01:13:45,900
architectural decisions training
 

4021
01:13:45,900 --> 01:13:47,570
architectural decisions training
decisions like the way the way they

4022
01:13:47,570 --> 01:13:47,580
decisions like the way the way they
 

4023
01:13:47,580 --> 01:13:49,189
decisions like the way the way they
deploy stuff the architectures they're

4024
01:13:49,189 --> 01:13:49,199
deploy stuff the architectures they're
 

4025
01:13:49,199 --> 01:13:51,410
deploy stuff the architectures they're
using in terms of the software how the

4026
01:13:51,410 --> 01:13:51,420
using in terms of the software how the
 

4027
01:13:51,420 --> 01:13:52,550
using in terms of the software how the
teams are running all that kind of stuff

4028
01:13:52,550 --> 01:13:52,560
teams are running all that kind of stuff
 

4029
01:13:52,560 --> 01:13:54,830

data collection anything interesting I

4030
01:13:54,830 --> 01:13:54,840
data collection anything interesting I
 

4031
01:13:54,840 --> 01:13:56,090
data collection anything interesting I
mean I know they're moving toward more

4032
01:13:56,090 --> 01:13:56,100
mean I know they're moving toward more
 

4033
01:13:56,100 --> 01:13:57,890
mean I know they're moving toward more
of an end-to-end approach

4034
01:13:57,890 --> 01:13:57,900
of an end-to-end approach
 

4035
01:13:57,900 --> 01:14:00,590
of an end-to-end approach
so creeping towards end to end as much

4036
01:14:00,590 --> 01:14:00,600
so creeping towards end to end as much
 

4037
01:14:00,600 --> 01:14:03,470
so creeping towards end to end as much
as possible across the whole thing the

4038
01:14:03,470 --> 01:14:03,480
as possible across the whole thing the
 

4039
01:14:03,480 --> 01:14:04,669
as possible across the whole thing the
the training the data collection

4040
01:14:04,669 --> 01:14:04,679
the training the data collection
 

4041
01:14:04,679 --> 01:14:06,290
the training the data collection
everything they also have a very fancy

4042
01:14:06,290 --> 01:14:06,300
everything they also have a very fancy
 

4043
01:14:06,300 --> 01:14:07,910
everything they also have a very fancy
simulator they're probably saying all

4044
01:14:07,910 --> 01:14:07,920
simulator they're probably saying all
 

4045
01:14:07,920 --> 01:14:09,290
simulator they're probably saying all
the same things we are they're probably

4046
01:14:09,290 --> 01:14:09,300
the same things we are they're probably
 

4047
01:14:09,300 --> 01:14:10,970
the same things we are they're probably
saying we just need to optimize you know

4048
01:14:10,970 --> 01:14:10,980
saying we just need to optimize you know
 

4049
01:14:10,980 --> 01:14:12,830
saying we just need to optimize you know
what is the reward we get Negative

4050
01:14:12,830 --> 01:14:12,840
what is the reward we get Negative
 

4051
01:14:12,840 --> 01:14:14,390
what is the reward we get Negative
reward for disengagement right like

4052
01:14:14,390 --> 01:14:14,400
reward for disengagement right like
 

4053
01:14:14,400 --> 01:14:16,430
reward for disengagement right like
everyone kind of knows this it's just a

4054
01:14:16,430 --> 01:14:16,440
everyone kind of knows this it's just a
 

4055
01:14:16,440 --> 01:14:17,510
everyone kind of knows this it's just a
question who can actually build and

4056
01:14:17,510 --> 01:14:17,520
question who can actually build and
 

4057
01:14:17,520 --> 01:14:18,830
question who can actually build and
deploy the system

4058
01:14:18,830 --> 01:14:18,840
deploy the system
 

4059
01:14:18,840 --> 01:14:21,229
deploy the system
yeah I mean this could it requires good

4060
01:14:21,229 --> 01:14:21,239
yeah I mean this could it requires good
 

4061
01:14:21,239 --> 01:14:23,689
yeah I mean this could it requires good
software engineering I think yeah and

4062
01:14:23,689 --> 01:14:23,699
software engineering I think yeah and
 

4063
01:14:23,699 --> 01:14:25,669
software engineering I think yeah and
the right kind of hardware

4064
01:14:25,669 --> 01:14:25,679
the right kind of hardware
 

4065
01:14:25,679 --> 01:14:27,709
the right kind of hardware
yeah and harder to run it

4066
01:14:27,709 --> 01:14:27,719
yeah and harder to run it
 

4067
01:14:27,719 --> 01:14:29,630
yeah and harder to run it
do you still don't believe in cloud in

4068
01:14:29,630 --> 01:14:29,640
do you still don't believe in cloud in
 

4069
01:14:29,640 --> 01:14:31,310
do you still don't believe in cloud in
that regard

4070
01:14:31,310 --> 01:14:31,320
that regard
 

4071
01:14:31,320 --> 01:14:32,750
that regard
I have a

4072
01:14:32,750 --> 01:14:32,760
I have a
 

4073
01:14:32,760 --> 01:14:36,530
I have a
compute cluster in my uh us 800 amps

4074
01:14:36,530 --> 01:14:36,540
compute cluster in my uh us 800 amps
 

4075

4079
01:14:41,699 --> 01:14:43,010
data center dicing crazy with 40
kilowatts is burning just when the

4081
01:14:43,020 --> 01:14:44,930
kilowatts is burning just when the
computers are idle yes sorry sorry

4082
01:14:44,930 --> 01:14:44,940
computers are idle yes sorry sorry

4085
01:14:47,940 --> 01:14:49,790

compute cluster I got it it's not a data

4086
01:14:49,790 --> 01:14:49,800
compute cluster I got it it's not a data
 

4087
01:14:49,800 --> 01:14:51,890
compute cluster I got it it's not a data
center yeah now data centers are clouds

4088
01:14:51,890 --> 01:14:51,900
center yeah now data centers are clouds
 

4089
01:14:51,900 --> 01:14:54,470
center yeah now data centers are clouds
we don't have clouds data centers have

4090
01:14:54,470 --> 01:14:54,480
we don't have clouds data centers have
 

4091
01:14:54,480 --> 01:14:56,510
we don't have clouds data centers have
air conditioners we have fans that makes

4092
01:14:56,510 --> 01:14:56,520
air conditioners we have fans that makes
 

4093
01:14:56,520 --> 01:14:59,330
air conditioners we have fans that makes
it a compute cluster

4094
01:14:59,330 --> 01:14:59,340
it a compute cluster
 

4095
01:14:59,340 --> 01:15:01,790
it a compute cluster
I'm guessing this is a kind of uh a

4096
01:15:01,790 --> 01:15:01,800
I'm guessing this is a kind of uh a
 

4097
01:15:01,800 --> 01:15:03,830
I'm guessing this is a kind of uh a
legal distinction sure yeah we have a

4098
01:15:03,830 --> 01:15:03,840
legal distinction sure yeah we have a
 

4099
01:15:03,840 --> 01:15:05,149
legal distinction sure yeah we have a
compute cluster

4100
01:15:05,149 --> 01:15:05,159
compute cluster
 

4101
01:15:05,159 --> 01:15:07,130
compute cluster

isn't that like an incredible thing that
 

4141

lot of people
but language feels like a reasoning

4148
01:15:54,770 --> 01:15:54,780
but language feels like a reasoning
 

4149
01:15:54,780 --> 01:15:56,950
but language feels like a reasoning
through the process of language which

4150
01:15:56,950 --> 01:15:56,960
through the process of language which
 

4151
01:15:56,960 --> 01:16:00,410
through the process of language which
looks a lot like thought

4152
01:16:00,410 --> 01:16:00,420
looks a lot like thought
 

4153
01:16:00,420 --> 01:16:03,590
looks a lot like thought
making brillian season chess which feels

4154
01:16:03,590 --> 01:16:03,600
making brillian season chess which feels
 

4155
01:16:03,600 --> 01:16:05,990
making brillian season chess which feels
a lot like thought whatever new thing

4156
01:16:05,990 --> 01:16:06,000
a lot like thought whatever new thing
 

4157
01:16:06,000 --> 01:16:07,910
a lot like thought whatever new thing
that AI can do everybody thinks is

4158
01:16:07,910 --> 01:16:07,920
that AI can do everybody thinks is
 

4159
01:16:07,920 --> 01:16:09,470
that AI can do everybody thinks is
brilliant and then like 20 years go by

4160
01:16:09,470 --> 01:16:09,480
brilliant and then like 20 years go by
 

4161
01:16:09,480 --> 01:16:10,550
brilliant and then like 20 years go by
and they're like well you have a chest

4162
01:16:10,550 --> 01:16:10,560
and they're like well you have a chest
 

4163
01:16:10,560 --> 01:16:12,050
and they're like well you have a chest
that's like mechanical like adding

4164
01:16:12,050 --> 01:16:12,060
that's like mechanical like adding
 

4165
01:16:12,060 --> 01:16:13,550
that's like mechanical like adding
that's like mechanical so you think

4166
01:16:13,550 --> 01:16:13,560
that's like mechanical so you think
 

4167
01:16:13,560 --> 01:16:15,410
that's like mechanical so you think
language is not that special it's like

4168
01:16:15,410 --> 01:16:15,420
language is not that special it's like
 

4169
01:16:15,420 --> 01:16:17,149
language is not that special it's like
chess it's like jazz I don't know

4170
01:16:17,149 --> 01:16:17,159
chess it's like jazz I don't know
 

4171
01:16:17,159 --> 01:16:21,530
chess it's like jazz I don't know
because it's very human we take it uh we

4172
01:16:21,530 --> 01:16:21,540
because it's very human we take it uh we
 

4173
01:16:21,540 --> 01:16:22,970
because it's very human we take it uh we
listen there's something different

4174
01:16:22,970 --> 01:16:22,980
listen there's something different
 

4175
01:16:22,980 --> 01:16:26,330
listen there's something different
between chess and and uh language chess

4176
01:16:26,330 --> 01:16:26,340
between chess and and uh language chess
 

4177
01:16:26,340 --> 01:16:28,610
between chess and and uh language chess
is a game that a subset of population

4178
01:16:28,610 --> 01:16:28,620
is a game that a subset of population
 

4179
01:16:28,620 --> 01:16:31,090
is a game that a subset of population
plays language is something we use

4180
01:16:31,090 --> 01:16:31,100
plays language is something we use
 

4181
01:16:31,100 --> 01:16:33,649
plays language is something we use
non-stop for all of our human

4182
01:16:33,649 --> 01:16:33,659
non-stop for all of our human
 

4183
01:16:33,659 --> 01:16:35,450
non-stop for all of our human
interaction and human interaction is

4184
01:16:35,450 --> 01:16:35,460
interaction and human interaction is
 

4185
01:16:35,460 --> 01:16:38,390
interaction and human interaction is
fundamental to society so it's like holy

4186
01:16:38,390 --> 01:16:38,400
fundamental to society so it's like holy
 

4187
01:16:38,400 --> 01:16:42,290
fundamental to society so it's like holy
[\h__\h] this this language thing is not so

4188
01:16:42,290 --> 01:16:42,300
[\h__\h] this this language thing is not so
 

4189
01:16:42,300 --> 01:16:44,030
[\h__\h] this this language thing is not so
difficult to like

4190
01:16:44,030 --> 01:16:44,040
difficult to like
 

4191
01:16:44,040 --> 01:16:47,030
difficult to like
create in the machine the problem is if

4192
01:16:47,030 --> 01:16:47,040
create in the machine the problem is if
 

4193
01:16:47,040 --> 01:16:49,189
create in the machine the problem is if
you go back to 1960 and you tell them

4194
01:16:49,189 --> 01:16:49,199
you go back to 1960 and you tell them
 

4195
01:16:49,199 --> 01:16:51,770
you go back to 1960 and you tell them
that you have a machine that can play

4196
01:16:51,770 --> 01:16:51,780
that you have a machine that can play
 

4197
01:16:51,780 --> 01:16:53,930
that you have a machine that can play
amazing chess

4198
01:16:53,930 --> 01:16:53,940
amazing chess
 

4199
01:16:53,940 --> 01:16:55,729
amazing chess
of course someone in 1960 will tell you

4200
01:16:55,729 --> 01:16:55,739
of course someone in 1960 will tell you
 

4201
01:16:55,739 --> 01:16:58,070
of course someone in 1960 will tell you
that machine is intelligent someone in

4202
01:16:58,070 --> 01:16:58,080
that machine is intelligent someone in
 

4203
01:16:58,080 --> 01:17:01,130
that machine is intelligent someone in
2010 won't what's changed right today we

4204
01:17:01,130 --> 01:17:01,140
2010 won't what's changed right today we
 

4205
01:17:01,140 --> 01:17:02,330
2010 won't what's changed right today we
think that these machines that have

4206
01:17:02,330 --> 01:17:02,340
think that these machines that have
 

4207
01:17:02,340 --> 01:17:04,669
think that these machines that have
language are intelligent but I think in

4208
01:17:04,669 --> 01:17:04,679
language are intelligent but I think in
 

4209
01:17:04,679 --> 01:17:06,169
language are intelligent but I think in
20 years we're going to be like yeah but

4210
01:17:06,169 --> 01:17:06,179
20 years we're going to be like yeah but
 

4211
01:17:06,179 --> 01:17:08,330
20 years we're going to be like yeah but
can it reproduce

4212
01:17:08,330 --> 01:17:08,340
can it reproduce
 

4213
01:17:08,340 --> 01:17:10,250
can it reproduce
so reproduction

4214
01:17:10,250 --> 01:17:10,260
so reproduction
 

4215
01:17:10,260 --> 01:17:12,410
so reproduction
yeah we might redefine what it means to

4216
01:17:12,410 --> 01:17:12,420
yeah we might redefine what it means to
 

4217
01:17:12,420 --> 01:17:15,350
yeah we might redefine what it means to
to be uh what is it a high performance

4218
01:17:15,350 --> 01:17:15,360
to be uh what is it a high performance
 

4219
01:17:15,360 --> 01:17:17,930
to be uh what is it a high performance
living organism on Earth humans are

4220
01:17:17,930 --> 01:17:17,940
living organism on Earth humans are
 

4221
01:17:17,940 --> 01:17:19,370
living organism on Earth humans are
always going to define a niche for

4222
01:17:19,370 --> 01:17:19,380
always going to define a niche for
 

4223
01:17:19,380 --> 01:17:20,810
always going to define a niche for
themselves like well you know we're

4224
01:17:20,810 --> 01:17:20,820
themselves like well you know we're
 

4225
01:17:20,820 --> 01:17:22,490
themselves like well you know we're
better than the machines because we can

4226
01:17:22,490 --> 01:17:22,500
better than the machines because we can
 

4227
01:17:22,500 --> 01:17:24,350
better than the machines because we can
you know and like they tried creative

4228
01:17:24,350 --> 01:17:24,360
you know and like they tried creative
 

4229
01:17:24,360 --> 01:17:25,790
you know and like they tried creative
for a bit but no one believes that one

4230
01:17:25,790 --> 01:17:25,800
for a bit but no one believes that one
 

4231
01:17:25,800 --> 01:17:26,750
for a bit but no one believes that one
anymore

4232
01:17:26,750 --> 01:17:26,760
anymore
 

4233
01:17:26,760 --> 01:17:29,870
anymore
but Niche is is that is that delusional

4234
01:17:29,870 --> 01:17:29,880
but Niche is is that is that delusional
 

4235
01:17:29,880 --> 01:17:31,130
but Niche is is that is that delusional
or is there some accuracy to that

4236
01:17:31,130 --> 01:17:31,140
or is there some accuracy to that
 

4237
01:17:31,140 --> 01:17:33,169
or is there some accuracy to that
because maybe like with chess you start

4238
01:17:33,169 --> 01:17:33,179
because maybe like with chess you start
 

4239
01:17:33,179 --> 01:17:35,149
because maybe like with chess you start
to realize like

4240
01:17:35,149 --> 01:17:35,159
to realize like
 

4241
01:17:35,159 --> 01:17:38,209
to realize like
that that uh we have ill-conceived

4242
01:17:38,209 --> 01:17:38,219
that that uh we have ill-conceived
 

4243
01:17:38,219 --> 01:17:40,729
that that uh we have ill-conceived
Notions of what uh what makes humans

4244
01:17:40,729 --> 01:17:40,739
Notions of what uh what makes humans
 

4245
01:17:40,739 --> 01:17:41,630
Notions of what uh what makes humans
special

4246
01:17:41,630 --> 01:17:41,640
special
 

4247
01:17:41,640 --> 01:17:46,310
special
like the Apex organism on Earth

4248
01:17:46,310 --> 01:17:46,320
like the Apex organism on Earth
 

4249
01:17:46,320 --> 01:17:48,350
like the Apex organism on Earth
yeah and I think maybe we're gonna go

4250
01:17:48,350 --> 01:17:48,360
yeah and I think maybe we're gonna go
 

4251
01:17:48,360 --> 01:17:50,510
yeah and I think maybe we're gonna go
through that same thing with language

4252
01:17:50,510 --> 01:17:50,520
through that same thing with language
 

4253
01:17:50,520 --> 01:17:53,630
through that same thing with language
and that same thing with creativity

4254
01:17:53,630 --> 01:17:53,640
and that same thing with creativity
 

4255
01:17:53,640 --> 01:17:55,910
and that same thing with creativity
the language carries these Notions of

4256
01:17:55,910 --> 01:17:55,920
the language carries these Notions of
 

4257
01:17:55,920 --> 01:17:58,430
the language carries these Notions of
Truth and so on and so we might be like

4258
01:17:58,430 --> 01:17:58,440
Truth and so on and so we might be like
 

4259
01:17:58,440 --> 01:18:00,890
Truth and so on and so we might be like
wait maybe truth is not carried by

4260
01:18:00,890 --> 01:18:00,900

01:21:04,140 --> 01:21:05,870
like for mediocre that's the scariest
kind of code I spent five percent of

4422
01:21:05,870 --> 01:21:05,880
kind of code I spent five percent of
 

4423
01:21:05,880 --> 01:21:07,430
kind of code I spent five percent of
time typing and 95 percent of time

4424
01:21:07,430 --> 01:21:07,440
time typing and 95 percent of time
 

4425
01:21:07,440 --> 01:21:09,410
time typing and 95 percent of time
debugging the last thing I want is close

4426
01:21:09,410 --> 01:21:09,420
debugging the last thing I want is close
 

4427
01:21:09,420 --> 01:21:11,630
debugging the last thing I want is close
to correct code I want a machine that

4428
01:21:11,630 --> 01:21:11,640
to correct code I want a machine that
 

4429
01:21:11,640 --> 01:21:13,130
to correct code I want a machine that
can help me with the debugging not with

4430
01:21:13,130 --> 01:21:13,140
can help me with the debugging not with
 

4431
01:21:13,140 --> 01:21:14,990
can help me with the debugging not with
the typing you know it's like L2 level

4432
01:21:14,990 --> 01:21:15,000
the typing you know it's like L2 level
 

4433
01:21:15,000 --> 01:21:17,570
the typing you know it's like L2 level
two uh uh driving similar kind of thing

4434
01:21:17,570 --> 01:21:17,580
two uh uh driving similar kind of thing
 

4435
01:21:17,580 --> 01:21:20,570
two uh uh driving similar kind of thing
yeah it's you still should be a good

4436
01:21:20,570 --> 01:21:20,580
yeah it's you still should be a good
 

4437
01:21:20,580 --> 01:21:22,970
yeah it's you still should be a good
programmer in order to modify I wouldn't

4438
01:21:22,970 --> 01:21:22,980
programmer in order to modify I wouldn't
 

4439
01:21:22,980 --> 01:21:24,950
programmer in order to modify I wouldn't
even say debugging it's just modifying

4440
01:21:24,950 --> 01:21:24,960
even say debugging it's just modifying
 

4441
01:21:24,960 --> 01:21:26,689
even say debugging it's just modifying
the code reading it don't think it's

4442
01:21:26,689 --> 01:21:26,699
the code reading it don't think it's
 

4443
01:21:26,699 --> 01:21:28,130
the code reading it don't think it's
like level two driving

4444
01:21:28,130 --> 01:21:28,140
like level two driving
 

4445
01:21:28,140 --> 01:21:30,169
like level two driving
I think driving is not tool complete and

4446
01:21:30,169 --> 01:21:30,179
I think driving is not tool complete and
 

4447
01:21:30,179 --> 01:21:32,090
I think driving is not tool complete and
programming is meaning you don't use

4448
01:21:32,090 --> 01:21:32,100
programming is meaning you don't use
 

4449
01:21:32,100 --> 01:21:34,970
programming is meaning you don't use
like the best possible tools to drive

4450
01:21:34,970 --> 01:21:34,980
like the best possible tools to drive
 

4451
01:21:34,980 --> 01:21:37,790
like the best possible tools to drive
right you're not you're not like like

4452
01:21:37,790 --> 01:21:37,800
right you're not you're not like like
 

4453
01:21:37,800 --> 01:21:39,530
right you're not you're not like like
cars have basically the same interface

4454
01:21:39,530 --> 01:21:39,540
cars have basically the same interface
 

4455
01:21:39,540 --> 01:21:41,689
cars have basically the same interface
for the last 50 years yep computers have

4456
01:21:41,689 --> 01:21:41,699
for the last 50 years yep computers have
 

4457
01:21:41,699 --> 01:21:43,490
for the last 50 years yep computers have
a radically different interface okay can

4458
01:21:43,490 --> 01:21:43,500
a radically different interface okay can
 

4459
01:21:43,500 --> 01:21:45,950
a radically different interface okay can
you describe the concept of tool

4460
01:21:45,950 --> 01:21:45,960
you describe the concept of tool
 

4461
01:21:45,960 --> 01:21:48,110
you describe the concept of tool
complete yeah so think about the

4462
01:21:48,110 --> 01:21:48,120
complete yeah so think about the
 

4463
01:21:48,120 --> 01:21:49,790
complete yeah so think about the
difference between a car from 1980 and a

4464
01:21:49,790 --> 01:21:49,800
difference between a car from 1980 and a
 

4465
01:21:49,800 --> 01:21:51,649
difference between a car from 1980 and a
car from today yeah no difference really

4466
01:21:51,649 --> 01:21:51,659
car from today yeah no difference really
 

4467
01:21:51,659 --> 01:21:53,209
car from today yeah no difference really
it's got a bunch of pedals it's got a

4468
01:21:53,209 --> 01:21:53,219
it's got a bunch of pedals it's got a
 

4469
01:21:53,219 --> 01:21:54,229
it's got a bunch of pedals it's got a
steering wheel

4470
01:21:54,229 --> 01:21:54,239
steering wheel
 

4471
01:21:54,239 --> 01:21:56,750
steering wheel
great maybe now it has a few Adas

4472
01:21:56,750 --> 01:21:56,760
great maybe now it has a few Adas
 

4473
01:21:56,760 --> 01:21:58,250
great maybe now it has a few Adas
features but it's pretty much the same

4474
01:21:58,250 --> 01:21:58,260
features but it's pretty much the same
 

4475
01:21:58,260 --> 01:21:59,810
features but it's pretty much the same
car right you have no problem getting

4476
01:21:59,810 --> 01:21:59,820
car right you have no problem getting
 

4477
01:21:59,820 --> 01:22:02,270
car right you have no problem getting
into a 1980 car and driving it

4478
01:22:02,270 --> 01:22:02,280
into a 1980 car and driving it
 

4479
01:22:02,280 --> 01:22:04,010
into a 1980 car and driving it
take a programmer today who spent their

4480
01:22:04,010 --> 01:22:04,020
take a programmer today who spent their
 

4481
01:22:04,020 --> 01:22:05,750
take a programmer today who spent their
whole life doing JavaScript and you put

4482
01:22:05,750 --> 01:22:05,760
whole life doing JavaScript and you put
 

4483
01:22:05,760 --> 01:22:07,910
whole life doing JavaScript and you put
them in an apple 2E prompt and you tell

4484
01:22:07,910 --> 01:22:07,920
them in an apple 2E prompt and you tell
 

4485
01:22:07,920 --> 01:22:11,149
them in an apple 2E prompt and you tell
them about the line numbers in basic

4486
01:22:11,149 --> 01:22:11,159
them about the line numbers in basic
 

4487
01:22:11,159 --> 01:22:13,130
them about the line numbers in basic
but how do I insert something between

4488
01:22:13,130 --> 01:22:13,140
but how do I insert something between
 

4489
01:22:13,140 --> 01:22:17,450
but how do I insert something between
line 17 and 18. oh wow

4490
01:22:17,450 --> 01:22:17,460
line 17 and 18. oh wow
 

4491
01:22:17,460 --> 01:22:20,990
line 17 and 18. oh wow
uh but the so you in tool you're putting

4492
01:22:20,990 --> 01:22:21,000
uh but the so you in tool you're putting
 

4493
01:22:21,000 --> 01:22:22,970
uh but the so you in tool you're putting
in the programming languages so it's

4494
01:22:22,970 --> 01:22:22,980
in the programming languages so it's
 

4495
01:22:22,980 --> 01:22:24,770
in the programming languages so it's
just the entirety stack of the tooling

4496
01:22:24,770 --> 01:22:24,780
just the entirety stack of the tooling
 

4497
01:22:24,780 --> 01:22:26,450
just the entirety stack of the tooling
exactly so it's not just like the like

4498
01:22:26,450 --> 01:22:26,460
exactly so it's not just like the like
 

4499
01:22:26,460 --> 01:22:28,250
exactly so it's not just like the like
IDs or something like this it's uh

4500
01:22:28,250 --> 01:22:28,260
IDs or something like this it's uh
 

4501
01:22:28,260 --> 01:22:29,930
IDs or something like this it's uh
everything yes it's heide's the language

4502
01:22:29,930 --> 01:22:29,940
everything yes it's heide's the language
 

4503
01:22:29,940 --> 01:22:31,550
everything yes it's heide's the language
is the runtimes it's it's everything and

4504
01:22:31,550 --> 01:22:31,560
is the runtimes it's it's everything and
 

4505
01:22:31,560 --> 01:22:33,830
is the runtimes it's it's everything and
programming is is tool complete so like

4506
01:22:33,830 --> 01:22:33,840
programming is is tool complete so like
 

4507
01:22:33,840 --> 01:22:35,570
programming is is tool complete so like
almost if

4508
01:22:35,570 --> 01:22:35,580
almost if
 

4509
01:22:35,580 --> 01:22:38,689
almost if
if if if codex or or co-pilot are

4510
01:22:38,689 --> 01:22:38,699
if if if codex or or co-pilot are
 

4511
01:22:38,699 --> 01:22:39,770
if if if codex or or co-pilot are
helping you

4512
01:22:39,770 --> 01:22:39,780
helping you
 

4513
01:22:39,780 --> 01:22:41,570
helping you
that actually probably means that your

4514
01:22:41,570 --> 01:22:41,580
that actually probably means that your
 

4515
01:22:41,580 --> 01:22:43,310
that actually probably means that your
framework or library is bad and there's

4516
01:22:43,310 --> 01:22:43,320
framework or library is bad and there's
 

4517
01:22:43,320 --> 01:22:46,850
framework or library is bad and there's
too much boilerplate in it

4518
01:22:46,850 --> 01:22:46,860

 

4519
01:22:46,860 --> 01:22:49,010

yeah but don't you think so much

4520
01:22:49,010 --> 01:22:49,020
yeah but don't you think so much
 

4521
01:22:49,020 --> 01:22:51,950
yeah but don't you think so much
programming has boilerplate tiny grad is

4522
01:22:51,950 --> 01:22:51,960
programming has boilerplate tiny grad is
 

4523
01:22:51,960 --> 01:22:55,550
programming has boilerplate tiny grad is
now 2700 lines and it can run llama and

4524
01:22:55,550 --> 01:22:55,560
now 2700 lines and it can run llama and
 

4525
01:22:55,560 --> 01:22:58,370
now 2700 lines and it can run llama and
stable diffusion and all of this stuff

4526
01:22:58,370 --> 01:22:58,380
stable diffusion and all of this stuff
 

4527
01:22:58,380 --> 01:23:02,510
stable diffusion and all of this stuff
is in 2700 lines boilerplate and

4528
01:23:02,510 --> 01:23:02,520
is in 2700 lines boilerplate and
 

4529
01:23:02,520 --> 01:23:05,149
is in 2700 lines boilerplate and
abstraction in directions and all these

4530
01:23:05,149 --> 01:23:05,159
abstraction in directions and all these
 

4531
01:23:05,159 --> 01:23:08,209
abstraction in directions and all these
things are just bad code

4532
01:23:08,209 --> 01:23:08,219
things are just bad code
 

4533
01:23:08,219 --> 01:23:10,370
things are just bad code
well

4534
01:23:10,370 --> 01:23:10,380
well
 

4535
01:23:10,380 --> 01:23:13,790
well
let's talk about good code and bad code

4536
01:23:13,790 --> 01:23:13,800
let's talk about good code and bad code
 

4537
01:23:13,800 --> 01:23:16,550
let's talk about good code and bad code
there's a I would say I don't know for

4538
01:23:16,550 --> 01:23:16,560
there's a I would say I don't know for
 

4539
01:23:16,560 --> 01:23:18,290
there's a I would say I don't know for
generic scripts that I write just

4540
01:23:18,290 --> 01:23:18,300
generic scripts that I write just
 

4541
01:23:18,300 --> 01:23:21,350
generic scripts that I write just
offhand like I like 80 of it is written

4542
01:23:21,350 --> 01:23:21,360
offhand like I like 80 of it is written
 

4543
01:23:21,360 --> 01:23:24,830
offhand like I like 80 of it is written
by GPT just a quick quick like offhand

4544
01:23:24,830 --> 01:23:24,840
by GPT just a quick quick like offhand
 

4545
01:23:24,840 --> 01:23:26,750
by GPT just a quick quick like offhand
stuff so not like libraries not like

4546
01:23:26,750 --> 01:23:26,760
stuff so not like libraries not like
 

4547
01:23:26,760 --> 01:23:29,209
stuff so not like libraries not like
performing code not stuff for Robotics

4548
01:23:29,209 --> 01:23:29,219
performing code not stuff for Robotics
 

4549
01:23:29,219 --> 01:23:31,729
performing code not stuff for Robotics
and so on just quick stuff because your

4550
01:23:31,729 --> 01:23:31,739
and so on just quick stuff because your
 

4551
01:23:31,739 --> 01:23:33,590
and so on just quick stuff because your
basic so much of programming is doing

4552
01:23:33,590 --> 01:23:33,600
basic so much of programming is doing
 

4553
01:23:33,600 --> 01:23:34,610
basic so much of programming is doing
some

4554
01:23:34,610 --> 01:23:34,620
some
 

4555
01:23:34,620 --> 01:23:37,490
some
some yeah boilerplate but to do so

4556
01:23:37,490 --> 01:23:37,500
some yeah boilerplate but to do so
 

4557
01:23:37,500 --> 01:23:40,310
some yeah boilerplate but to do so
efficiently and quickly

4558
01:23:40,310 --> 01:23:40,320
efficiently and quickly
 

4559
01:23:40,320 --> 01:23:42,649
efficiently and quickly
because you can't really automate it

4560
01:23:42,649 --> 01:23:42,659
because you can't really automate it
 

4561
01:23:42,659 --> 01:23:44,870
because you can't really automate it
fully with like generic method like a

4562
01:23:44,870 --> 01:23:44,880
fully with like generic method like a
 

4563
01:23:44,880 --> 01:23:47,090
fully with like generic method like a
generic kind of

4564
01:23:47,090 --> 01:23:47,100
generic kind of
 

4565
01:23:47,100 --> 01:23:49,490
generic kind of
um ID type of recommendation or

4566
01:23:49,490 --> 01:23:49,500
um ID type of recommendation or
 

4567
01:23:49,500 --> 01:23:50,990
um ID type of recommendation or
something like this you do need to have

4568
01:23:50,990 --> 01:23:51,000
something like this you do need to have
 

4569
01:23:51,000 --> 01:23:52,310
something like this you do need to have
some of the complexity of language

4570
01:23:52,310 --> 01:23:52,320
some of the complexity of language
 

4571
01:23:52,320 --> 01:23:55,010
some of the complexity of language
models yeah I guess if I was really

4572
01:23:55,010 --> 01:23:55,020
models yeah I guess if I was really
 

4573
01:23:55,020 --> 01:23:57,770
models yeah I guess if I was really
writing like maybe today if I wrote like

4574
01:23:57,770 --> 01:23:57,780
writing like maybe today if I wrote like
 

4575
01:23:57,780 --> 01:23:59,870
writing like maybe today if I wrote like
a lot of like data parsing stuff yeah I

4576
01:23:59,870 --> 01:23:59,880
a lot of like data parsing stuff yeah I
 

4577
01:23:59,880 --> 01:24:01,310
a lot of like data parsing stuff yeah I
mean I don't play ctfs anymore but if I

4578
01:24:01,310 --> 01:24:01,320
mean I don't play ctfs anymore but if I
 

4579
01:24:01,320 --> 01:24:02,870
mean I don't play ctfs anymore but if I
still play ctfs a lot of like it's just

4580
01:24:02,870 --> 01:24:02,880
still play ctfs a lot of like it's just
 

4581
01:24:02,880 --> 01:24:04,130
still play ctfs a lot of like it's just
like you have to write like a parser for

4582
01:24:04,130 --> 01:24:04,140
like you have to write like a parser for
 

4583
01:24:04,140 --> 01:24:06,830
like you have to write like a parser for
this data format like I wonder or like

4584
01:24:06,830 --> 01:24:06,840
this data format like I wonder or like
 

4585
01:24:06,840 --> 01:24:08,390
this data format like I wonder or like
admin of code

4586
01:24:08,390 --> 01:24:08,400
admin of code
 

4587
01:24:08,400 --> 01:24:10,250
admin of code
um I wonder when the models are going to

4588
01:24:10,250 --> 01:24:10,260
um I wonder when the models are going to
 

4589
01:24:10,260 --> 01:24:11,930
um I wonder when the models are going to
start to help with that kind of code and

4590
01:24:11,930 --> 01:24:11,940
start to help with that kind of code and
 

4591
01:24:11,940 --> 01:24:14,090
start to help with that kind of code and
they may they may and the models Also

4592
01:24:14,090 --> 01:24:14,100
they may they may and the models Also
 

4593
01:24:14,100 --> 01:24:16,070
they may they may and the models Also
may help you with speed yeah the model

4594
01:24:16,070 --> 01:24:16,080
may help you with speed yeah the model
 

4595
01:24:16,080 --> 01:24:17,270
may help you with speed yeah the model
is very fast

4596
01:24:17,270 --> 01:24:17,280
is very fast
 

4597
01:24:17,280 --> 01:24:19,910
is very fast
but where the models won't I my

4598
01:24:19,910 --> 01:24:19,920
but where the models won't I my
 

4599
01:24:19,920 --> 01:24:22,370
but where the models won't I my
programming speed is not at all limited

4600
01:24:22,370 --> 01:24:22,380
programming speed is not at all limited
 

4601
01:24:22,380 --> 01:24:26,149
programming speed is not at all limited
by my typing speed

4602
01:24:26,149 --> 01:24:26,159

 

4603
01:24:26,159 --> 01:24:29,570

and in very few cases it is yes if I'm

4604
01:24:29,570 --> 01:24:29,580
and in very few cases it is yes if I'm
 

4605
01:24:29,580 --> 01:24:31,550
and in very few cases it is yes if I'm
writing some script to just like parse

4606
01:24:31,550 --> 01:24:31,560
writing some script to just like parse
 

4607
01:24:31,560 --> 01:24:33,890
writing some script to just like parse
some weird data format sure my

4608
01:24:33,890 --> 01:24:33,900
some weird data format sure my
 

4609
01:24:33,900 --> 01:24:34,970
some weird data format sure my
programming speed is limited by my

4610
01:24:34,970 --> 01:24:34,980
programming speed is limited by my
 

4611
01:24:34,980 --> 01:24:36,410
programming speed is limited by my
typing speed what about looking stuff up

4612
01:24:36,410 --> 01:24:36,420
typing speed what about looking stuff up
 

4613
01:24:36,420 --> 01:24:38,090
typing speed what about looking stuff up
because that's essentially a more

4614
01:24:38,090 --> 01:24:38,100
because that's essentially a more
 

4615
01:24:38,100 --> 01:24:40,850
because that's essentially a more
efficient lookup right you know

4616
01:24:40,850 --> 01:24:40,860
efficient lookup right you know
 

4617
01:24:40,860 --> 01:24:42,410
efficient lookup right you know
when I was out when I was at Twitter I

4618
01:24:42,410 --> 01:24:42,420
when I was out when I was at Twitter I
 

4619
01:24:42,420 --> 01:24:45,410
when I was out when I was at Twitter I
tried to use uh chatgpt to uh to like

4620
01:24:45,410 --> 01:24:45,420
tried to use uh chatgpt to uh to like
 

4621
01:24:45,420 --> 01:24:47,450
tried to use uh chatgpt to uh to like
ask some questions like what's the API

4622
01:24:47,450 --> 01:24:47,460
ask some questions like what's the API
 

4623
01:24:47,460 --> 01:24:49,790
ask some questions like what's the API
for this and it would just hallucinate

4624
01:24:49,790 --> 01:24:49,800
for this and it would just hallucinate
 

4625
01:24:49,800 --> 01:24:51,890
for this and it would just hallucinate
it would just give me completely made up

4626
01:24:51,890 --> 01:24:51,900
it would just give me completely made up
 

4627
01:24:51,900 --> 01:24:54,229
it would just give me completely made up
API functions that sounded real

4628
01:24:54,229 --> 01:24:54,239
API functions that sounded real
 

4629
01:24:54,239 --> 01:24:55,970
API functions that sounded real
uh well do you think that's just a

4630
01:24:55,970 --> 01:24:55,980
uh well do you think that's just a
 

4631
01:24:55,980 --> 01:24:58,430
uh well do you think that's just a
temporary kind of stage

4632
01:24:58,430 --> 01:24:58,440
temporary kind of stage
 

4633
01:24:58,440 --> 01:24:59,930
temporary kind of stage
you don't think it'll get better and

4634
01:24:59,930 --> 01:24:59,940
you don't think it'll get better and
 

4635
01:24:59,940 --> 01:25:01,010
you don't think it'll get better and
better and better in this kind of stuff

4636
01:25:01,010 --> 01:25:01,020
better and better in this kind of stuff
 

4637
01:25:01,020 --> 01:25:02,810
better and better in this kind of stuff
because like it only hallucinates stuff

4638
01:25:02,810 --> 01:25:02,820
because like it only hallucinates stuff
 

4639
01:25:02,820 --> 01:25:05,330
because like it only hallucinates stuff
in in the edge cases yes if your

4640
01:25:05,330 --> 01:25:05,340
in in the edge cases yes if your
 

4641
01:25:05,340 --> 01:25:06,530
in in the edge cases yes if your
engineering code it's actually pretty

4642
01:25:06,530 --> 01:25:06,540
engineering code it's actually pretty
 

4643
01:25:06,540 --> 01:25:08,390
engineering code it's actually pretty
good yes if you are writing an absolute

4644
01:25:08,390 --> 01:25:08,400
good yes if you are writing an absolute
 

4645
01:25:08,400 --> 01:25:10,490
good yes if you are writing an absolute
basic like react app with a button it's

4646
01:25:10,490 --> 01:25:10,500
basic like react app with a button it's
 

4647
01:25:10,500 --> 01:25:12,050
basic like react app with a button it's
not gonna hallucinate sure

4648
01:25:12,050 --> 01:25:12,060
not gonna hallucinate sure
 

4649
01:25:12,060 --> 01:25:13,850
not gonna hallucinate sure
no there's kind of ways to fix the

4650
01:25:13,850 --> 01:25:13,860
no there's kind of ways to fix the
 

4651
01:25:13,860 --> 01:25:15,590
no there's kind of ways to fix the
hallucination problem I think Facebook

4652
01:25:15,590 --> 01:25:15,600
hallucination problem I think Facebook
 

4653
01:25:15,600 --> 01:25:16,910
hallucination problem I think Facebook
is an interesting paper it's called

4654
01:25:16,910 --> 01:25:16,920
is an interesting paper it's called
 

4655
01:25:16,920 --> 01:25:19,189
is an interesting paper it's called
Atlas and it's actually weird the way

4656
01:25:19,189 --> 01:25:19,199
Atlas and it's actually weird the way
 

4657
01:25:19,199 --> 01:25:21,229
Atlas and it's actually weird the way
that we do uh language models right now

4658
01:25:21,229 --> 01:25:21,239
that we do uh language models right now
 

4659
01:25:21,239 --> 01:25:24,890
that we do uh language models right now
where all of the uh information is in

4660
01:25:24,890 --> 01:25:24,900
where all of the uh information is in
 

4661
01:25:24,900 --> 01:25:27,050
where all of the uh information is in
the weights and human brains don't

4662
01:25:27,050 --> 01:25:27,060
the weights and human brains don't
 

4663
01:25:27,060 --> 01:25:28,550
the weights and human brains don't
really like this it's like a hippocampus

4664
01:25:28,550 --> 01:25:28,560
really like this it's like a hippocampus
 

4665
01:25:28,560 --> 01:25:30,830
really like this it's like a hippocampus
and a memory system so why don't llms

4666
01:25:30,830 --> 01:25:30,840
and a memory system so why don't llms
 

4667
01:25:30,840 --> 01:25:32,390
and a memory system so why don't llms
have a memory system and there's people

4668
01:25:32,390 --> 01:25:32,400
have a memory system and there's people
 

4669
01:25:32,400 --> 01:25:34,250
have a memory system and there's people
working on them I think future llms are

4670
01:25:34,250 --> 01:25:34,260
working on them I think future llms are
 

4671
01:25:34,260 --> 01:25:36,890
working on them I think future llms are
going to be like smaller but are going

4672
01:25:36,890 --> 01:25:36,900
going to be like smaller but are going
 

4673
01:25:36,900 --> 01:25:39,649
going to be like smaller but are going
to run looping on themselves and are

4674
01:25:39,649 --> 01:25:39,659
to run looping on themselves and are
 

4675
01:25:39,659 --> 01:25:41,570
to run looping on themselves and are
going to have retrieval systems

4676
01:25:41,570 --> 01:25:41,580
going to have retrieval systems
 

4677
01:25:41,580 --> 01:25:43,250
going to have retrieval systems
and the thing about using a retrieval

4678
01:25:43,250 --> 01:25:43,260
and the thing about using a retrieval
 

4679
01:25:43,260 --> 01:25:45,050
and the thing about using a retrieval
system is you can cite sources

4680
01:25:45,050 --> 01:25:45,060
system is you can cite sources
 

4681
01:25:45,060 --> 01:25:47,090
system is you can cite sources
explicitly um

4682
01:25:47,090 --> 01:25:47,100
explicitly um
 

4683
01:25:47,100 --> 01:25:50,390
explicitly um
which is uh really helpful to integrate

4684
01:25:50,390 --> 01:25:50,400
which is uh really helpful to integrate
 

4685
01:25:50,400 --> 01:25:52,490
which is uh really helpful to integrate
the human into the loop of the of the

4686
01:25:52,490 --> 01:25:52,500
the human into the loop of the of the
 

4687
01:25:52,500 --> 01:25:53,630
the human into the loop of the of the
thing because you can go check the

4688
01:25:53,630 --> 01:25:53,640
thing because you can go check the
 

4689
01:25:53,640 --> 01:25:55,729
thing because you can go check the
sources and you can investigate so

4690
01:25:55,729 --> 01:25:55,739
sources and you can investigate so
 

4691
01:25:55,739 --> 01:25:57,530
sources and you can investigate so
whenever the thing is hallucinating you

4692
01:25:57,530 --> 01:25:57,540
whenever the thing is hallucinating you
 

4693
01:25:57,540 --> 01:25:59,750
whenever the thing is hallucinating you
can like have the human supervision so

4694
01:25:59,750 --> 01:25:59,760
can like have the human supervision so
 

4695
01:25:59,760 --> 01:26:01,430
can like have the human supervision so
that's pushing it towards level two kind

4696
01:26:01,430 --> 01:26:01,440
that's pushing it towards level two kind
 

4697
01:26:01,440 --> 01:26:03,229
that's pushing it towards level two kind
of that's going to kill Google

4698
01:26:03,229 --> 01:26:03,239
of that's going to kill Google
 

4699
01:26:03,239 --> 01:26:05,149
of that's going to kill Google
wait which part when someone makes an

4700
01:26:05,149 --> 01:26:05,159
wait which part when someone makes an
 

4701
01:26:05,159 --> 01:26:07,010
wait which part when someone makes an
llm that's capable of citing its sources

4702
01:26:07,010 --> 01:26:07,020
llm that's capable of citing its sources
 

4703
01:26:07,020 --> 01:26:08,629
llm that's capable of citing its sources
it will kill Google

4704
01:26:08,629 --> 01:26:08,639
it will kill Google
 

4705
01:26:08,639 --> 01:26:10,669
it will kill Google
LM that's citing a sources because

4706
01:26:10,669 --> 01:26:10,679
LM that's citing a sources because
 

4707
01:26:10,679 --> 01:26:12,950
LM that's citing a sources because
that's basically a search engine

4708
01:26:12,950 --> 01:26:12,960
that's basically a search engine
 

4709
01:26:12,960 --> 01:26:14,270
that's basically a search engine
that's what people want Miss search

4710
01:26:14,270 --> 01:26:14,280
that's what people want Miss search
 

4711
01:26:14,280 --> 01:26:15,950
that's what people want Miss search
engine but also Google might be the

4712
01:26:15,950 --> 01:26:15,960
engine but also Google might be the
 

4713
01:26:15,960 --> 01:26:18,410
engine but also Google might be the
people that build it maybe I put ads on

4714
01:26:18,410 --> 01:26:18,420
people that build it maybe I put ads on
 

4715
01:26:18,420 --> 01:26:20,750
people that build it maybe I put ads on
it I'd count them out

4716
01:26:20,750 --> 01:26:20,760
it I'd count them out
 

4717
01:26:20,760 --> 01:26:22,910
it I'd count them out
what is that what do you think who who

4718
01:26:22,910 --> 01:26:22,920
what is that what do you think who who
 

4719
01:26:22,920 --> 01:26:26,270
what is that what do you think who who
wins this uh race we got who who are the

4720
01:26:26,270 --> 01:26:26,280
wins this uh race we got who who are the
 

4721
01:26:26,280 --> 01:26:28,910
wins this uh race we got who who are the
competitors all right we've got tiny

4722
01:26:28,910 --> 01:26:28,920
competitors all right we've got tiny
 

4723
01:26:28,920 --> 01:26:32,450
competitors all right we've got tiny
Corp I don't know if that's yeah I mean

4724
01:26:32,450 --> 01:26:32,460
Corp I don't know if that's yeah I mean
 

4725
01:26:32,460 --> 01:26:33,709
Corp I don't know if that's yeah I mean
you're a legitimate competitor in that

4726
01:26:33,709 --> 01:26:33,719
you're a legitimate competitor in that
 

4727
01:26:33,719 --> 01:26:36,050
you're a legitimate competitor in that
I'm not trying to compete on that you're

4728
01:26:36,050 --> 01:26:36,060
I'm not trying to compete on that you're
 

4729
01:26:36,060 --> 01:26:37,370
I'm not trying to compete on that you're
not no not as this can accidentally

4730
01:26:37,370 --> 01:26:37,380

01:31:51,530 --> 01:31:51,540
you end up paper clipped there's no way
 

5047
01:31:51,540 --> 01:31:52,970
you end up paper clipped there's no way
you end up pay-per-clipped if everybody

5048
01:31:52,970 --> 01:31:52,980
you end up pay-per-clipped if everybody
 

5049
01:31:52,980 --> 01:31:55,610
you end up pay-per-clipped if everybody
has an AI so open sourcing is the way to

5050
01:31:55,610 --> 01:31:55,620
has an AI so open sourcing is the way to
 

5051
01:31:55,620 --> 01:31:57,530
has an AI so open sourcing is the way to
fight the paperclip maximizer absolutely

5052
01:31:57,530 --> 01:31:57,540
fight the paperclip maximizer absolutely
 

5053
01:31:57,540 --> 01:31:59,930
fight the paperclip maximizer absolutely
it's the only way you think you're going

5054
01:31:59,930 --> 01:31:59,940
it's the only way you think you're going
 

5055
01:31:59,940 --> 01:32:01,310
it's the only way you think you're going
to control it you're not going to

5056
01:32:01,310 --> 01:32:01,320
to control it you're not going to
 

5057
01:32:01,320 --> 01:32:03,530
to control it you're not going to
control it so the criticism you have for

5058
01:32:03,530 --> 01:32:03,540
control it so the criticism you have for
 

5059
01:32:03,540 --> 01:32:07,070
control it so the criticism you have for
the AI safety folks is that there's a

5060
01:32:07,070 --> 01:32:07,080
the AI safety folks is that there's a
 

5061
01:32:07,080 --> 01:32:10,669
the AI safety folks is that there's a
belief and a desire for control yeah and

5062
01:32:10,669 --> 01:32:10,679
belief and a desire for control yeah and
 

5063
01:32:10,679 --> 01:32:12,350
belief and a desire for control yeah and
that belief and desire

5064
01:32:12,350 --> 01:32:12,360
that belief and desire
 

5065
01:32:12,360 --> 01:32:14,990
that belief and desire
for centralized control of dangerous AI

5066
01:32:14,990 --> 01:32:15,000
for centralized control of dangerous AI
 

5067
01:32:15,000 --> 01:32:17,990

at open AI knows what I just said was

5080
01:32:32,930 --> 01:32:32,940
at open AI knows what I just said was
 

5081
01:32:32,940 --> 01:32:36,229
at open AI knows what I just said was
true right now uh ask the question

5082
01:32:36,229 --> 01:32:36,239
true right now uh ask the question
 

5083
01:32:36,239 --> 01:32:39,470
true right now uh ask the question
really you know it upsets me when I like

gpt2 when openai came out with gpt2 and

5086
01:32:41,930 --> 01:32:41,940
gpt2 when openai came out with gpt2 and
 

5087
01:32:41,940 --> 01:32:43,669
gpt2 when openai came out with gpt2 and
raised a whole fake AI safety thing

5088
01:32:43,669 --> 01:32:43,679
raised a whole fake AI safety thing
 

5089
01:32:43,679 --> 01:32:44,990
raised a whole fake AI safety thing
about that I mean now the model is

5090
01:32:44,990 --> 01:32:45,000
about that I mean now the model is
 

5091
01:32:45,000 --> 01:32:46,370
about that I mean now the model is
laughable

5092
01:32:46,370 --> 01:32:46,380
laughable
 

5093
01:32:46,380 --> 01:32:49,850
laughable
like they they used AI safety to Hype up

5094
01:32:49,850 --> 01:32:49,860
like they they used AI safety to Hype up
 

5095
01:32:49,860 --> 01:32:52,610
like they they used AI safety to Hype up
their company and it's disgusting

5096
01:32:52,610 --> 01:32:52,620
their company and it's disgusting
 

5097
01:32:52,620 --> 01:32:56,629
their company and it's disgusting
or the flip side of that is they used a

or the flip side of that is they used a
 

5099
01:32:56,639 --> 01:32:59,209

relatively weak model in retrospect to
explore how do we do AI safety correctly

5102
01:33:02,030 --> 01:33:02,040
explore how do we do AI safety correctly
 

5103
01:33:02,040 --> 01:33:03,410
explore how do we do AI safety correctly
how do we release things how do we go

5104
01:33:03,410 --> 01:33:03,420
how do we release things how do we go

hype there is in AI safety honestly oh

5114
01:33:12,890 --> 01:33:12,900
hype there is in AI safety honestly oh
 

5115
01:33:12,900 --> 01:33:14,870
hype there is in AI safety honestly oh
there's so much I at least on Twitter I

5116
01:33:14,870 --> 01:33:14,880
there's so much I at least on Twitter I
 

5117
01:33:14,880 --> 01:33:15,950
there's so much I at least on Twitter I
don't know maybe Twitter's not realized

5118
01:33:15,950 --> 01:33:15,960
don't know maybe Twitter's not realized
 

5119
01:33:15,960 --> 01:33:19,250

01:33:19,250 --> 01:33:19,260
but it's not real life come on in terms
 

5121
01:33:19,260 --> 01:33:20,870
but it's not real life come on in terms
of hype I mean I don't

01:33:20,870 --> 01:33:20,880
of hype I mean I don't
 

5123
01:33:20,880 --> 01:33:23,629
of hype I mean I don't
I think open AI has been finding an

5124
01:33:23,629 --> 01:33:23,639
I think open AI has been finding an
 

5125
01:33:23,639 --> 01:33:25,910
I think open AI has been finding an
interesting balance between transparency

5126
01:33:25,910 --> 01:33:25,920
interesting balance between transparency
 

5127
01:33:25,920 --> 01:33:29,209
interesting balance between transparency
and putting value on um AI safety you

5128
01:33:29,209 --> 01:33:29,219
and putting value on um AI safety you
 

5129
01:33:29,219 --> 01:33:31,070
and putting value on um AI safety you
don't think you think just go

5130
01:33:31,070 --> 01:33:31,080
don't think you think just go
 

5131
01:33:31,080 --> 01:33:34,850
don't think you think just go
all out open source so do a llama so do

5132
01:33:34,850 --> 01:33:34,860
all out open source so do a llama so do
 

5133
01:33:34,860 --> 01:33:37,790
all out open source so do a llama so do
like open source this is a tough

5134
01:33:37,790 --> 01:33:37,800
like open source this is a tough
 

5135
01:33:37,800 --> 01:33:40,610
like open source this is a tough
question which is open source both the

5136
01:33:40,610 --> 01:33:40,620
question which is open source both the
 

5137
01:33:40,620 --> 01:33:43,189
question which is open source both the
the base the foundation model and the

5138
01:33:43,189 --> 01:33:43,199
the base the foundation model and the
 

5139
01:33:43,199 --> 01:33:46,370
the base the foundation model and the
fine-tuned one so like the the model

5140
01:33:46,370 --> 01:33:46,380
fine-tuned one so like the the model
 

5141
01:33:46,380 --> 01:33:48,590
fine-tuned one so like the the model
that can be ultra racist and dangerous

5142
01:33:48,590 --> 01:33:48,600
that can be ultra racist and dangerous
 

5143
01:33:48,600 --> 01:33:51,590
that can be ultra racist and dangerous
and like tell you how to build a nuclear

5144
01:33:51,590 --> 01:33:51,600
and like tell you how to build a nuclear
 

5145
01:33:51,600 --> 01:33:53,090
and like tell you how to build a nuclear
weapon oh my God have you met humans

5146
01:33:53,090 --> 01:33:53,100
weapon oh my God have you met humans
 

5147
01:33:53,100 --> 01:33:55,790
weapon oh my God have you met humans
right like half of these AI I haven't

5148
01:33:55,790 --> 01:33:55,800
right like half of these AI I haven't
 

5149
01:33:55,800 --> 01:33:58,790
right like half of these AI I haven't
met most humans I this makes this this

5150
01:33:58,790 --> 01:33:58,800
met most humans I this makes this this
 

5151
01:33:58,800 --> 01:34:00,770
met most humans I this makes this this
this allows you to meet every human yeah

5152
01:34:00,770 --> 01:34:00,780
this allows you to meet every human yeah
 

5153
01:34:00,780 --> 01:34:02,629
this allows you to meet every human yeah
I know but half of these AI alignment

5154
01:34:02,629 --> 01:34:02,639
I know but half of these AI alignment
 

5155
01:34:02,639 --> 01:34:04,129
I know but half of these AI alignment
problems are just human alignment

5156
01:34:04,129 --> 01:34:04,139
problems are just human alignment
 

5157
01:34:04,139 --> 01:34:05,810
problems are just human alignment
problems and that's what's also so scary

5158
01:34:05,810 --> 01:34:05,820
problems and that's what's also so scary
 

5159
01:34:05,820 --> 01:34:07,370
problems and that's what's also so scary
about The Language they use it's like

5160
01:34:07,370 --> 01:34:07,380
about The Language they use it's like
 

5161
01:34:07,380 --> 01:34:09,169
about The Language they use it's like
it's not the machines you want to align

5162
01:34:09,169 --> 01:34:09,179
it's not the machines you want to align
 

5163
01:34:09,179 --> 01:34:11,209
it's not the machines you want to align
it's me

5164
01:34:11,209 --> 01:34:11,219
it's me
 

5165
01:34:11,219 --> 01:34:13,189
it's me
but here's the thing

5166
01:34:13,189 --> 01:34:13,199
but here's the thing
 

5167
01:34:13,199 --> 01:34:17,050
but here's the thing
it makes it very accessible to ask

5168
01:34:17,050 --> 01:34:17,060
it makes it very accessible to ask
 

5169
01:34:17,060 --> 01:34:20,330
it makes it very accessible to ask
very uh

5170
01:34:20,330 --> 01:34:20,340
very uh
 

5171
01:34:20,340 --> 01:34:22,070
very uh
questions where the answers have

5172
01:34:22,070 --> 01:34:22,080
questions where the answers have
 

5173
01:34:22,080 --> 01:34:23,629
questions where the answers have
dangerous consequences if you were to

5174
01:34:23,629 --> 01:34:23,639
dangerous consequences if you were to
 

5175
01:34:23,639 --> 01:34:25,070
dangerous consequences if you were to
act on them

5176
01:34:25,070 --> 01:34:25,080
act on them
 

5177
01:34:25,080 --> 01:34:28,790
act on them
I mean yeah welcome to the world well no

5178
01:34:28,790 --> 01:34:28,800
I mean yeah welcome to the world well no
 

5179
01:34:28,800 --> 01:34:30,950
I mean yeah welcome to the world well no
for me there's a lot of friction if I

5180
01:34:30,950 --> 01:34:30,960
for me there's a lot of friction if I
 

5181
01:34:30,960 --> 01:34:34,070
for me there's a lot of friction if I
want to find out how to uh

5182
01:34:34,070 --> 01:34:34,080
want to find out how to uh
 

5183
01:34:34,080 --> 01:34:36,950
want to find out how to uh
I don't know blow up something no

5184
01:34:36,950 --> 01:34:36,960
I don't know blow up something no
 

5185
01:34:36,960 --> 01:34:38,450
I don't know blow up something no
there's not a lot of friction that's so

5186
01:34:38,450 --> 01:34:38,460
there's not a lot of friction that's so
 

5187
01:34:38,460 --> 01:34:40,729
there's not a lot of friction that's so
easy no like what do I search today's

everybody who you know maybe has um ill
 

5347
01:37:16,020 --> 01:37:17,570
everybody who you know maybe has um ill
intention but is not so intelligent and

5348
01:37:17,570 --> 01:37:17,580
intention but is not so intelligent and
 

5349
01:37:17,580 --> 01:37:19,370
intention but is not so intelligent and
gave them intelligence

5350
01:37:19,370 --> 01:37:19,380
gave them intelligence
 

5351
01:37:19,380 --> 01:37:20,450
gave them intelligence
right

5352
01:37:20,450 --> 01:37:20,460
right
 

5353
01:37:20,460 --> 01:37:22,850
right
so we should have intelligence control

5354
01:37:22,850 --> 01:37:22,860
so we should have intelligence control
 

5355
01:37:22,860 --> 01:37:24,350
so we should have intelligence control
of course we should only give

5356
01:37:24,350 --> 01:37:24,360
of course we should only give
 

5357
01:37:24,360 --> 01:37:26,450
of course we should only give
intelligence to good people and that is

5358
01:37:26,450 --> 01:37:26,460
intelligence to good people and that is
 

5359
01:37:26,460 --> 01:37:28,550
intelligence to good people and that is
the absolutely horrifying idea so do you

5360
01:37:28,550 --> 01:37:28,560
the absolutely horrifying idea so do you
 

5361
01:37:28,560 --> 01:37:30,470
the absolutely horrifying idea so do you
the best defense is actually the best

5362
01:37:30,470 --> 01:37:30,480
the best defense is actually the best
 

5363
01:37:30,480 --> 01:37:32,810
the best defense is actually the best
defense is to give more intelligence to

5364
01:37:32,810 --> 01:37:32,820
defense is to give more intelligence to
 

5365
01:37:32,820 --> 01:37:34,550
defense is to give more intelligence to
the to the good guys and the give

5366
01:37:34,550 --> 01:37:34,560
the to the good guys and the give
 

5367
01:37:34,560 --> 01:37:35,570
the to the good guys and the give
intelligence to everybody give

5368
01:37:35,570 --> 01:37:35,580
intelligence to everybody give
 

5369
01:37:35,580 --> 01:37:36,590
intelligence to everybody give
intelligence to everybody you know what

5370
01:37:36,590 --> 01:37:36,600
intelligence to everybody you know what
 

5371
01:37:36,600 --> 01:37:37,669
intelligence to everybody you know what
it's not even like guns right like

5372
01:37:37,669 --> 01:37:37,679
it's not even like guns right like
 

5373
01:37:37,679 --> 01:37:38,689
it's not even like guns right like
people say this about guns you know

5374
01:37:38,689 --> 01:37:38,699
people say this about guns you know
 

5375
01:37:38,699 --> 01:37:39,709
people say this about guns you know
what's what's the best defense against a

5376
01:37:39,709 --> 01:37:39,719
what's what's the best defense against a
 

5377
01:37:39,719 --> 01:37:41,090
what's what's the best defense against a
bad guy with a gun good guy with a gun I

5378
01:37:41,090 --> 01:37:41,100
bad guy with a gun good guy with a gun I
 

5379
01:37:41,100 --> 01:37:42,649
bad guy with a gun good guy with a gun I
think I kind of subscribe to that but I

5380
01:37:42,649 --> 01:37:42,659
think I kind of subscribe to that but I
 

5381
01:37:42,659 --> 01:37:43,550
think I kind of subscribe to that but I
really subscribe to that with

5382
01:37:43,550 --> 01:37:43,560
really subscribe to that with
 

5383
01:37:43,560 --> 01:37:44,830
really subscribe to that with
intelligence

5384
01:37:44,830 --> 01:37:44,840
intelligence
 

5385
01:37:44,840 --> 01:37:47,570
intelligence
yeah in a fundamental way I I agree with

5386
01:37:47,570 --> 01:37:47,580
yeah in a fundamental way I I agree with
 

5387
01:37:47,580 --> 01:37:49,729
yeah in a fundamental way I I agree with
you but there's just feels like so much

5388
01:37:49,729 --> 01:37:49,739
you but there's just feels like so much
 

5389
01:37:49,739 --> 01:37:50,930
you but there's just feels like so much
uncertainty and so much can happen

5390
01:37:50,930 --> 01:37:50,940
uncertainty and so much can happen
 

5391
01:37:50,940 --> 01:37:52,910
uncertainty and so much can happen
rapidly that you can lose a lot of

5392
01:37:52,910 --> 01:37:52,920
rapidly that you can lose a lot of
 

5393
01:37:52,920 --> 01:37:54,290
rapidly that you can lose a lot of
control and you can do a lot of damage

5394
01:37:54,290 --> 01:37:54,300
control and you can do a lot of damage
 

5395
01:37:54,300 --> 01:37:57,470
control and you can do a lot of damage
oh no we can lose control yes yes thank

5396
01:37:57,470 --> 01:37:57,480
oh no we can lose control yes yes thank
 

5397
01:37:57,480 --> 01:38:00,050
oh no we can lose control yes yes thank
God yeah I hope we can I hope they lose

5398
01:38:00,050 --> 01:38:00,060
God yeah I hope we can I hope they lose
 

5399
01:38:00,060 --> 01:38:02,209
God yeah I hope we can I hope they lose
control

5400
01:38:02,209 --> 01:38:02,219
control
 

5401
01:38:02,219 --> 01:38:03,830
control
I want them to lose control more than

5402
01:38:03,830 --> 01:38:03,840
I want them to lose control more than
 

5403
01:38:03,840 --> 01:38:05,209
I want them to lose control more than
anything else

5404
01:38:05,209 --> 01:38:05,219
anything else
 

5405
01:38:05,219 --> 01:38:07,010
anything else
I think when you lose control you can do

5406
01:38:07,010 --> 01:38:07,020
I think when you lose control you can do
 

5407
01:38:07,020 --> 01:38:08,629
I think when you lose control you can do
a lot of damage but you can do more

5408
01:38:08,629 --> 01:38:08,639
a lot of damage but you can do more
 

5409
01:38:08,639 --> 01:38:11,689
a lot of damage but you can do more
damage when you centralize and hold on

5410
01:38:11,689 --> 01:38:11,699
damage when you centralize and hold on
 

5411
01:38:11,699 --> 01:38:13,669
damage when you centralize and hold on
to control is the point centralized and

5412
01:38:13,669 --> 01:38:13,679
to control is the point centralized and
 

5413
01:38:13,679 --> 01:38:16,250
to control is the point centralized and
held control is tyranny all right I will

5414
01:38:16,250 --> 01:38:16,260
held control is tyranny all right I will
 

5415
01:38:16,260 --> 01:38:17,810
held control is tyranny all right I will
always I don't like Anarchy either but

5416
01:38:17,810 --> 01:38:17,820
always I don't like Anarchy either but
 

5417
01:38:17,820 --> 01:38:19,189

I'll always take Anarchy over tyranny

5418
01:38:19,189 --> 01:38:19,199
I'll always take Anarchy over tyranny
 

5419
01:38:19,199 --> 01:38:21,649
I'll always take Anarchy over tyranny
Anarchy you have a chance

5420
01:38:21,649 --> 01:38:21,659
Anarchy you have a chance
 

5421
01:38:21,659 --> 01:38:23,689
Anarchy you have a chance
this human civilization we've got going

5422
01:38:23,689 --> 01:38:23,699
this human civilization we've got going
 

5423
01:38:23,699 --> 01:38:26,270
this human civilization we've got going
on is quite interesting I mean I agree

5424
01:38:26,270 --> 01:38:26,280
on is quite interesting I mean I agree
 

5425
01:38:26,280 --> 01:38:29,209
on is quite interesting I mean I agree
with you so do you open source

5426
01:38:29,209 --> 01:38:29,219
with you so do you open source
 

5427
01:38:29,219 --> 01:38:31,370
with you so do you open source
is the way forward here so you admire

5428
01:38:31,370 --> 01:38:31,380
is the way forward here so you admire
 

5429
01:38:31,380 --> 01:38:32,930
is the way forward here so you admire
what Facebook is doing here or what Matt

5430
01:38:32,930 --> 01:38:32,940
what Facebook is doing here or what Matt
 

5431
01:38:32,940 --> 01:38:35,450
what Facebook is doing here or what Matt
is doing with the release of them yeah a

5432
01:38:35,450 --> 01:38:35,460
is doing with the release of them yeah a
 

5433
01:38:35,460 --> 01:38:37,189
is doing with the release of them yeah a
lot I lost I lost 80 000 last year

5434
01:38:37,189 --> 01:38:37,199
lot I lost I lost 80 000 last year
 

5435
01:38:37,199 --> 01:38:38,990
lot I lost I lost 80 000 last year
investing in meta and when they released

5436
01:38:38,990 --> 01:38:39,000
investing in meta and when they released
 

5437
01:38:39,000 --> 01:38:40,669
investing in meta and when they released
llama I'm like yeah whatever man that

5438
01:38:40,669 --> 01:38:40,679
llama I'm like yeah whatever man that
 

5439

llama I'm like yeah whatever man that
was worth it it's worth it

5440
01:38:43,010 --> 01:38:43,020
was worth it it's worth it
 

5441
01:38:43,020 --> 01:38:46,070
was worth it it's worth it
do you think Google and uh open AI with

5442
01:38:46,070 --> 01:38:46,080
do you think Google and uh open AI with
 

5443
01:38:46,080 --> 01:38:48,410
do you think Google and uh open AI with
Microsoft will match what what what meta

5444
01:38:48,410 --> 01:38:48,420
Microsoft will match what what what meta
 

5445
01:38:48,420 --> 01:38:49,610
Microsoft will match what what what meta
is doing or no

5446
01:38:49,610 --> 01:38:49,620
is doing or no
 

5447
01:38:49,620 --> 01:38:52,850
is doing or no
so if I were a researcher why would you

5448
01:38:52,850 --> 01:38:52,860
so if I were a researcher why would you
 

5449
01:38:52,860 --> 01:38:54,649
so if I were a researcher why would you
want to work at open AI like you know

5450
01:38:54,649 --> 01:38:54,659
want to work at open AI like you know
 

5451
01:38:54,659 --> 01:38:57,169
want to work at open AI like you know
you're just you're on the bad team like

5452
01:38:57,169 --> 01:38:57,179
you're just you're on the bad team like
 

5453
01:38:57,179 --> 01:38:58,550
you're just you're on the bad team like
I mean it like you're on the bad team

5454
01:38:58,550 --> 01:38:58,560
I mean it like you're on the bad team
 

5455
01:38:58,560 --> 01:39:00,649
I mean it like you're on the bad team
who can't even say that gpt4 has 220

5456
01:39:00,649 --> 01:39:00,659
who can't even say that gpt4 has 220
 

5457
01:39:00,659 --> 01:39:02,510
who can't even say that gpt4 has 220
billion parameters so closed source to

5458
01:39:02,510 --> 01:39:02,520
billion parameters so closed source to
 

5459
01:39:02,520 --> 01:39:03,709
billion parameters so closed source to
use the bad team

5460
01:39:03,709 --> 01:39:03,719
use the bad team
 

5461
01:39:03,719 --> 01:39:05,750
use the bad team
not only closed Source I'm not saying

5462
01:39:05,750 --> 01:39:05,760
not only closed Source I'm not saying
 

5463
01:39:05,760 --> 01:39:08,149
not only closed Source I'm not saying
you need to make your model weights open

5464
01:39:08,149 --> 01:39:08,159
you need to make your model weights open
 

5465
01:39:08,159 --> 01:39:09,770
you need to make your model weights open
I'm not saying that I totally understand

5466
01:39:09,770 --> 01:39:09,780
I'm not saying that I totally understand
 

5467
01:39:09,780 --> 01:39:11,390
I'm not saying that I totally understand
we're keeping our model weights closed

5468
01:39:11,390 --> 01:39:11,400
we're keeping our model weights closed
 

5469
01:39:11,400 --> 01:39:12,890
we're keeping our model weights closed
because that's our product right that's

5470
01:39:12,890 --> 01:39:12,900
because that's our product right that's
 

5471
01:39:12,900 --> 01:39:13,850
because that's our product right that's
fine

5472
01:39:13,850 --> 01:39:13,860
fine
 

5473
01:39:13,860 --> 01:39:16,729
fine
I'm saying like because of AI safety

5474
01:39:16,729 --> 01:39:16,739
I'm saying like because of AI safety
 

5475
01:39:16,739 --> 01:39:18,590
I'm saying like because of AI safety
reasons we can't tell you the number of

5476
01:39:18,590 --> 01:39:18,600
reasons we can't tell you the number of
 

5477
01:39:18,600 --> 01:39:21,050
reasons we can't tell you the number of
billions of parameters in the model

5478
01:39:21,050 --> 01:39:21,060
billions of parameters in the model
 

5479
01:39:21,060 --> 01:39:22,910
billions of parameters in the model
that's just the bad guys

5480
01:39:22,910 --> 01:39:22,920
that's just the bad guys
 

5481
01:39:22,920 --> 01:39:25,070
that's just the bad guys
just because you're mocking AI safety

5482
01:39:25,070 --> 01:39:25,080
just because you're mocking AI safety
 

5483
01:39:25,080 --> 01:39:27,110
just because you're mocking AI safety
doesn't mean it's not real oh of course

5484
01:39:27,110 --> 01:39:27,120
doesn't mean it's not real oh of course
 

5485
01:39:27,120 --> 01:39:29,030
doesn't mean it's not real oh of course
is it possible that these things can

5486
01:39:29,030 --> 01:39:29,040
is it possible that these things can
 

5487
01:39:29,040 --> 01:39:30,649
is it possible that these things can
really do a lot of damage that we don't

5488
01:39:30,649 --> 01:39:30,659
really do a lot of damage that we don't
 

5489
01:39:30,659 --> 01:39:33,169
really do a lot of damage that we don't
know about oh my God yes intelligence is

5490
01:39:33,169 --> 01:39:33,179
know about oh my God yes intelligence is
 

5491
01:39:33,179 --> 01:39:35,450
know about oh my God yes intelligence is
so dangerous be it human intelligence or

5492
01:39:35,450 --> 01:39:35,460
so dangerous be it human intelligence or
 

5493
01:39:35,460 --> 01:39:37,490
so dangerous be it human intelligence or
machine intelligence intelligence is

5494
01:39:37,490 --> 01:39:37,500
machine intelligence intelligence is
 

5495
01:39:37,500 --> 01:39:39,590
machine intelligence intelligence is
dangerous to put machine intelligence is

5496
01:39:39,590 --> 01:39:39,600
dangerous to put machine intelligence is
 

5497
01:39:39,600 --> 01:39:41,629
dangerous to put machine intelligence is
so much easier to deploy at scale like

5498
01:39:41,629 --> 01:39:41,639
so much easier to deploy at scale like
 

5499
01:39:41,639 --> 01:39:42,770
so much easier to deploy at scale like
rapidly

5500
01:39:42,770 --> 01:39:42,780
rapidly
 

5501
01:39:42,780 --> 01:39:45,290
rapidly
like what okay if you have human-like

5502
01:39:45,290 --> 01:39:45,300
like what okay if you have human-like
 

5503
01:39:45,300 --> 01:39:47,870
like what okay if you have human-like
bots on Twitter all right

5504
01:39:47,870 --> 01:39:47,880
bots on Twitter all right
 

5505
01:39:47,880 --> 01:39:49,790
bots on Twitter all right
and you have like a thousand of them

5506
01:39:49,790 --> 01:39:49,800
and you have like a thousand of them
 

5507
01:39:49,800 --> 01:39:51,830
and you have like a thousand of them
create a whole narrative

5508
01:39:51,830 --> 01:39:51,840
create a whole narrative
 

5509
01:39:51,840 --> 01:39:55,430
create a whole narrative
like you can manipulate millions of

5510
01:39:55,430 --> 01:39:55,440
like you can manipulate millions of
 

5511
01:39:55,440 --> 01:39:56,689
like you can manipulate millions of
people but you mean like the

5512
01:39:56,689 --> 01:39:56,699
people but you mean like the
 

5513
01:39:56,699 --> 01:39:58,070
people but you mean like the
intelligence agencies in America are

5514
01:39:58,070 --> 01:39:58,080
intelligence agencies in America are
 

5515
01:39:58,080 --> 01:39:59,750
intelligence agencies in America are
doing right now yeah but they're not

5516
01:39:59,750 --> 01:39:59,760
doing right now yeah but they're not
 

5517
01:39:59,760 --> 01:40:01,669
doing right now yeah but they're not
doing it that that well it feels like

5518
01:40:01,669 --> 01:40:01,679
doing it that that well it feels like
 

5519
01:40:01,679 --> 01:40:03,950
doing it that that well it feels like
you can do a lot they're doing it pretty

5520
01:40:03,950 --> 01:40:03,960
you can do a lot they're doing it pretty
 

5521
01:40:03,960 --> 01:40:05,209
you can do a lot they're doing it pretty
well

5522
01:40:05,209 --> 01:40:05,219
well
 

5523
01:40:05,219 --> 01:40:07,070
well
I think they're doing a pretty good job

5524
01:40:07,070 --> 01:40:07,080
I think they're doing a pretty good job
 

5525
01:40:07,080 --> 01:40:09,530
I think they're doing a pretty good job
I I suspect they're not nearly as good

5526
01:40:09,530 --> 01:40:09,540
I I suspect they're not nearly as good
 

5527
01:40:09,540 --> 01:40:12,290
I I suspect they're not nearly as good
as a bunch of uh GPT fueled Bots could

5528
01:40:12,290 --> 01:40:12,300
as a bunch of uh GPT fueled Bots could
 

5529
01:40:12,300 --> 01:40:13,790
as a bunch of uh GPT fueled Bots could
be well I mean of course they're looking

5530
01:40:13,790 --> 01:40:13,800
be well I mean of course they're looking
 

5531
01:40:13,800 --> 01:40:15,470
be well I mean of course they're looking
into the latest Technologies for control

5532
01:40:15,470 --> 01:40:15,480
into the latest Technologies for control
 

5533
01:40:15,480 --> 01:40:17,930
into the latest Technologies for control
of people of course but I think there's

5534
01:40:17,930 --> 01:40:17,940
of people of course but I think there's
 

5535
01:40:17,940 --> 01:40:19,550
of people of course but I think there's
a George Haas type character that can do

5536
01:40:19,550 --> 01:40:19,560
a George Haas type character that can do
 

5537
01:40:19,560 --> 01:40:21,290
a George Haas type character that can do
a better job than the entirety of them

5538
01:40:21,290 --> 01:40:21,300
a better job than the entirety of them
 

5539
01:40:21,300 --> 01:40:23,450
a better job than the entirety of them
you don't think so no way no and I'll

5540
01:40:23,450 --> 01:40:23,460
you don't think so no way no and I'll
 

5541
01:40:23,460 --> 01:40:24,590
you don't think so no way no and I'll
tell you why the George hot's character

5542
01:40:24,590 --> 01:40:24,600
tell you why the George hot's character
 

5543
01:40:24,600 --> 01:40:25,610
tell you why the George hot's character
can't and I thought about this a lot

5544
01:40:25,610 --> 01:40:25,620
can't and I thought about this a lot
 

5545
01:40:25,620 --> 01:40:27,050
can't and I thought about this a lot
with hacking right like I can find

5546
01:40:27,050 --> 01:40:27,060
with hacking right like I can find
 

5547
01:40:27,060 --> 01:40:28,250
with hacking right like I can find
exploits in web browsers I probably

5548
01:40:28,250 --> 01:40:28,260
exploits in web browsers I probably
 

5549
01:40:28,260 --> 01:40:29,570
exploits in web browsers I probably
still can I mean I was better when I was

5550
01:40:29,570 --> 01:40:29,580
still can I mean I was better when I was
 

5551
01:40:29,580 --> 01:40:31,070
still can I mean I was better when I was
24 but

5552
01:40:31,070 --> 01:40:31,080
24 but
 

5553
01:40:31,080 --> 01:40:33,590
24 but
the thing that I lack is the ability to

5554
01:40:33,590 --> 01:40:33,600
the thing that I lack is the ability to
 

5555
01:40:33,600 --> 01:40:35,149
the thing that I lack is the ability to
slowly and steadily deploy them over

5556
01:40:35,149 --> 01:40:35,159
slowly and steadily deploy them over
 

5557
01:40:35,159 --> 01:40:37,070
slowly and steadily deploy them over
five years and this is what intelligence

5558
01:40:37,070 --> 01:40:37,080
five years and this is what intelligence
 

5559
01:40:37,080 --> 01:40:38,629
five years and this is what intelligence
agencies are very good at right

5560
01:40:38,629 --> 01:40:38,639
agencies are very good at right
 

5561
01:40:38,639 --> 01:40:40,070
agencies are very good at right
intelligence agencies don't have the

5562
01:40:40,070 --> 01:40:40,080
intelligence agencies don't have the
 

5563
01:40:40,080 --> 01:40:42,229
intelligence agencies don't have the
most sophisticated technology

5564
01:40:42,229 --> 01:40:42,239
most sophisticated technology
 

5565
01:40:42,239 --> 01:40:45,530
most sophisticated technology
they just have endurance endurance

5566
01:40:45,530 --> 01:40:45,540
they just have endurance endurance
 

5567
01:40:45,540 --> 01:40:49,189
they just have endurance endurance
yeah the financial backing

5568
01:40:49,189 --> 01:40:49,199
yeah the financial backing
 

5569
01:40:49,199 --> 01:40:51,770
yeah the financial backing
and the infrastructure for the endurance

5570
01:40:51,770 --> 01:40:51,780
and the infrastructure for the endurance
 

5571
01:40:51,780 --> 01:40:54,350
and the infrastructure for the endurance
so the more we can decentralize power

5572
01:40:54,350 --> 01:40:54,360
so the more we can decentralize power
 

5573
01:40:54,360 --> 01:40:56,570
so the more we can decentralize power
like you can make an argument by the way

5574
01:40:56,570 --> 01:40:56,580
like you can make an argument by the way
 

5575
01:40:56,580 --> 01:40:58,550
like you can make an argument by the way
that nobody should have these things and

5576
01:40:58,550 --> 01:40:58,560
that nobody should have these things and
 

5577
01:40:58,560 --> 01:41:00,110
that nobody should have these things and
I would defend that argument I would I

5578
01:41:00,110 --> 01:41:00,120
I would defend that argument I would I
 

5579
01:41:00,120 --> 01:41:03,470
I would defend that argument I would I
would like saying look llms and Ai and

5580
01:41:03,470 --> 01:41:03,480
would like saying look llms and Ai and
 

5581
01:41:03,480 --> 01:41:05,030
would like saying look llms and Ai and
machine intelligence can cause a lot of

5582
01:41:05,030 --> 01:41:05,040
machine intelligence can cause a lot of
 

5583
01:41:05,040 --> 01:41:07,550
machine intelligence can cause a lot of
harm so nobody should have it and I will

5584
01:41:07,550 --> 01:41:07,560
harm so nobody should have it and I will
 

5585
01:41:07,560 --> 01:41:09,110
harm so nobody should have it and I will
respect someone philosophically with

5586
01:41:09,110 --> 01:41:09,120
respect someone philosophically with
 

5587
01:41:09,120 --> 01:41:10,610
respect someone philosophically with
that position just like I will respect

5588
01:41:10,610 --> 01:41:10,620
that position just like I will respect
 

5589
01:41:10,620 --> 01:41:11,629
that position just like I will respect
someone philosophically with the

5590
01:41:11,629 --> 01:41:11,639
someone philosophically with the
 

5591
01:41:11,639 --> 01:41:13,729
someone philosophically with the
position that nobody should have guns

5592
01:41:13,729 --> 01:41:13,739
position that nobody should have guns
 

5593
01:41:13,739 --> 01:41:15,350
position that nobody should have guns
right but I will not respect

5594
01:41:15,350 --> 01:41:15,360
right but I will not respect
 

5595
01:41:15,360 --> 01:41:17,870
right but I will not respect
philosophically which it with with

philosophically which it with with

Only The Trusted authorities should have

01:41:20,510 --> 01:41:20,520
Only The Trusted authorities should have
 

5599
01:41:20,520 --> 01:41:22,850
Only The Trusted authorities should have
access to this yeah who are The Trusted

01:41:22,850 --> 01:41:22,860
access to this yeah who are The Trusted
 

5601
01:41:22,860 --> 01:41:24,709
access to this yeah who are The Trusted

worried about alignment between

01:41:29,940 --> 01:41:31,729
AI company and their machines I'm
worried about alignment between me and

5608
01:41:31,729 --> 01:41:31,739
worried about alignment between me and
 

5609
01:41:31,739 --> 01:41:32,990
worried about alignment between me and

what do you think of the azer idkowski

5612
01:41:35,750 --> 01:41:35,760
what do you think of the azer idkowski
 

5613
01:41:35,760 --> 01:41:37,490
what do you think of the azer idkowski
would say to you

5614
01:41:37,490 --> 01:41:37,500
would say to you
 

5615
01:41:37,500 --> 01:41:39,709
would say to you
because he's really against open source

5616
01:41:39,709 --> 01:41:39,719
because he's really against open source
 

5617
01:41:39,719 --> 01:41:44,930
because he's really against open source
I know and

5618
01:41:44,930 --> 01:41:44,940

 

5619
01:41:44,940 --> 01:41:47,510

I thought about this and

5620
01:41:47,510 --> 01:41:47,520
I thought about this and
 

5621
01:41:47,520 --> 01:41:51,590
I thought about this and
I think this comes down to a repeated

5622
01:41:51,590 --> 01:41:51,600
I think this comes down to a repeated
 

5623
01:41:51,600 --> 01:41:53,689
I think this comes down to a repeated
misunderstanding of political power by

5624
01:41:53,689 --> 01:41:53,699
misunderstanding of political power by
 

5625
01:41:53,699 --> 01:41:55,729
misunderstanding of political power by
the rationalists

5626
01:41:55,729 --> 01:41:55,739
the rationalists
 

5627
01:41:55,739 --> 01:41:57,490
the rationalists
interesting

5628
01:41:57,490 --> 01:41:57,500
interesting
 

5629
01:41:57,500 --> 01:42:01,490
interesting
I think that Elias yudkowski is scared

5630
01:42:01,490 --> 01:42:01,500
I think that Elias yudkowski is scared
 

5631
01:42:01,500 --> 01:42:03,229
I think that Elias yudkowski is scared
of these things and I am scared of these

5632
01:42:03,229 --> 01:42:03,239
of these things and I am scared of these
 

5633
01:42:03,239 --> 01:42:05,510
of these things and I am scared of these
things too everyone should be scared of

5634
01:42:05,510 --> 01:42:05,520
things too everyone should be scared of
 

5635
01:42:05,520 --> 01:42:08,030
things too everyone should be scared of
these things these things are scary

5636
01:42:08,030 --> 01:42:08,040
these things these things are scary
 

5637
01:42:08,040 --> 01:42:10,370
these things these things are scary
but now you ask about the two possible

5638
01:42:10,370 --> 01:42:10,380
but now you ask about the two possible
 

5639
01:42:10,380 --> 01:42:14,930
but now you ask about the two possible
Futures one where a small trusted

5640
01:42:14,930 --> 01:42:14,940
Futures one where a small trusted
 

5641
01:42:14,940 --> 01:42:17,390
Futures one where a small trusted
centralized group of people has them and

5642
01:42:17,390 --> 01:42:17,400
centralized group of people has them and
 

5643
01:42:17,400 --> 01:42:19,129
centralized group of people has them and
the other where everyone has them

5644
01:42:19,129 --> 01:42:19,139
the other where everyone has them
 

5645
01:42:19,139 --> 01:42:21,109
the other where everyone has them
and I am much less scared of the second

5646
01:42:21,109 --> 01:42:21,119
and I am much less scared of the second
 

5647
01:42:21,119 --> 01:42:23,149
and I am much less scared of the second
future than the first

5648
01:42:23,149 --> 01:42:23,159
future than the first
 

5649
01:42:23,159 --> 01:42:25,070
future than the first
well there's a small trusted group of

5650
01:42:25,070 --> 01:42:25,080
well there's a small trusted group of
 

5651
01:42:25,080 --> 01:42:26,629
well there's a small trusted group of
people that have control of our nuclear

5652
01:42:26,629 --> 01:42:26,639
people that have control of our nuclear
 

5653
01:42:26,639 --> 01:42:28,669
people that have control of our nuclear
weapons

5654
01:42:28,669 --> 01:42:28,679
weapons
 

5655
01:42:28,679 --> 01:42:31,250
weapons
there's a difference again a nuclear

5656
01:42:31,250 --> 01:42:31,260
there's a difference again a nuclear
 

5657
01:42:31,260 --> 01:42:32,870
there's a difference again a nuclear
weapon cannot be deployed tactically and

5658
01:42:32,870 --> 01:42:32,880
weapon cannot be deployed tactically and
 

5659
01:42:32,880 --> 01:42:34,189
weapon cannot be deployed tactically and
a nuclear weapon is not a defense

5660
01:42:34,189 --> 01:42:34,199
a nuclear weapon is not a defense
 

5661
01:42:34,199 --> 01:42:36,669
a nuclear weapon is not a defense
against a nuclear weapon

5662
01:42:36,669 --> 01:42:36,679
against a nuclear weapon
 

5663
01:42:36,679 --> 01:42:38,990
against a nuclear weapon
except maybe in some philosophical mind

5664
01:42:38,990 --> 01:42:39,000
except maybe in some philosophical mind
 

5665
01:42:39,000 --> 01:42:41,689

everybody
well if good outnumbers bad then you

5758
01:44:20,149 --> 01:44:20,159
well if good outnumbers bad then you
 

5759
01:44:20,159 --> 01:44:21,350
well if good outnumbers bad then you
definitely gave it to more good people

model architectures open source and

5780
01:44:39,590 --> 01:44:39,600
model architectures open source and
 

5781
01:44:39,600 --> 01:44:41,930
model architectures open source and
fundamental breakthroughs open source I

5782
01:44:41,930 --> 01:44:41,940
fundamental breakthroughs open source I
 

5783
01:44:41,940 --> 01:44:42,890
fundamental breakthroughs open source I
don't think you have to make way to open

5784
01:44:42,890 --> 01:44:42,900
don't think you have to make way to open
 

5785
01:44:42,900 --> 01:44:44,689
don't think you have to make way to open
source you know what's interesting is

5786
01:44:44,689 --> 01:44:44,699
source you know what's interesting is
 

5787
01:44:44,699 --> 01:44:45,770
source you know what's interesting is
that

5788
01:44:45,770 --> 01:44:45,780
that
 

5789
01:44:45,780 --> 01:44:47,629
that
like there's so many possible

5790
01:44:47,629 --> 01:44:47,639
like there's so many possible
 

5791
01:44:47,639 --> 01:44:50,689
like there's so many possible

you could have the next Google be open

5794
01:44:52,790 --> 01:44:52,800
you could have the next Google be open
 

5795
01:44:52,800 --> 01:44:54,709
you could have the next Google be open
source so for example

5796
01:44:54,709 --> 01:44:54,719
source so for example
 

5797
01:44:54,719 --> 01:44:56,810
source so for example
I don't know if that connection is

5798
01:44:56,810 --> 01:44:56,820
I don't know if that connection is
 

5799
01:44:56,820 --> 01:44:58,910
I don't know if that connection is
accurate but you know Wikipedia made a

5800
01:44:58,910 --> 01:44:58,920
accurate but you know Wikipedia made a
 

5801
01:44:58,920 --> 01:45:00,470
accurate but you know Wikipedia made a
lot of interesting decisions not to put

5802
01:45:00,470 --> 01:45:00,480
lot of interesting decisions not to put
 

5803
01:45:00,480 --> 01:45:03,290

ads like Wikipedia is basically open

5804
01:45:03,290 --> 01:45:03,300
ads like Wikipedia is basically open
 

5805
01:45:03,300 --> 01:45:04,910
ads like Wikipedia is basically open
source you could think of it that way

5806
01:45:04,910 --> 01:45:04,920
source you could think of it that way
 

5807
01:45:04,920 --> 01:45:07,310
source you could think of it that way
yeah and like that's one of the main

5808
01:45:07,310 --> 01:45:07,320
yeah and like that's one of the main
 

5809
01:45:07,320 --> 01:45:09,470
yeah and like that's one of the main
websites on the internet and like it

5810
01:45:09,470 --> 01:45:09,480
websites on the internet and like it
 

5811
01:45:09,480 --> 01:45:10,609
websites on the internet and like it
didn't have to be that way it could have

5812
01:45:10,609 --> 01:45:10,619
didn't have to be that way it could have
 

5813
01:45:10,619 --> 01:45:12,169
didn't have to be that way it could have
been like Google could have created

5814
01:45:12,169 --> 01:45:12,179
been like Google could have created
 

5815
01:45:12,179 --> 01:45:13,970
been like Google could have created
Wikipedia put ads on it you could

5816
01:45:13,970 --> 01:45:13,980
Wikipedia put ads on it you could
 

5817
01:45:13,980 --> 01:45:15,590
Wikipedia put ads on it you could
probably run amazing ads now on

5818
01:45:15,590 --> 01:45:15,600
probably run amazing ads now on
 

5819
01:45:15,600 --> 01:45:17,390
probably run amazing ads now on

5821
01:45:17,400 --> 01:45:20,209
Wikipedia you wouldn't have to keep
asking for money but it's interesting

5822
01:45:20,209 --> 01:45:20,219
asking for money but it's interesting
 

5823
01:45:20,219 --> 01:45:23,050

I wonder if that's anecdotal or if it uh
 

6117
01:50:46,199 --> 01:50:47,810
I wonder if that's anecdotal or if it uh
if there's true to that there's

01:50:58,860 --> 01:51:00,350
my own biases right that may be my own
bias is that these people are a lot more

6130
01:51:00,350 --> 01:51:00,360
bias is that these people are a lot more
 

6131

use the word censorship that way but
 

6735
02:01:26,040 --> 02:01:27,649

you should probably have tools
 

6745
02:01:35,360 --> 02:01:38,209
you should probably have tools
that maximize the quality of the

how to do that I love this agreement and
debate and people who disagree with each

6756
02:01:50,870 --> 02:01:50,880

talking that's like snarky and so on
 

6769
02:02:03,599 --> 02:02:06,229
talking that's like snarky and so on
that somehow is gets people on Twitter

6770
02:02:06,229 --> 02:02:06,239
that somehow is gets people on Twitter
 

6771
02:02:06,239 --> 02:02:08,149
that somehow is gets people on Twitter
and they get excited and so on we have

6772
02:02:08,149 --> 02:02:08,159
and they get excited and so on we have
 

6773
02:02:08,159 --> 02:02:09,589
and they get excited and so on we have
like ad hominem refuting the Central

6774
02:02:09,589 --> 02:02:09,599
like ad hominem refuting the Central
 

6775
02:02:09,599 --> 02:02:11,030
like ad hominem refuting the Central
Point I've like seeing this as an actual

6776
02:02:11,030 --> 02:02:11,040
Point I've like seeing this as an actual
 

6777
02:02:11,040 --> 02:02:12,890
Point I've like seeing this as an actual
pyramid something yeah it's yeah and

6778
02:02:12,890 --> 02:02:12,900
pyramid something yeah it's yeah and
 

6779
02:02:12,900 --> 02:02:15,290
pyramid something yeah it's yeah and
it's it's like all of it all the wrong

6780
02:02:15,290 --> 02:02:15,300
it's it's like all of it all the wrong
 

6781
02:02:15,300 --> 02:02:17,209
it's it's like all of it all the wrong
stuff is attractive to people I mean we

6782
02:02:17,209 --> 02:02:17,219
stuff is attractive to people I mean we
 

6783
02:02:17,219 --> 02:02:18,410
stuff is attractive to people I mean we
can just train a classify her to

6784
02:02:18,410 --> 02:02:18,420
can just train a classify her to
 

6785
02:02:18,420 --> 02:02:20,330
can just train a classify her to
absolutely say what level of Maslow's

6786
02:02:20,330 --> 02:02:20,340
absolutely say what level of Maslow's
 

6787
02:02:20,340 --> 02:02:22,370
absolutely say what level of Maslow's
hierarchy of argument are you at and if

6788
02:02:22,370 --> 02:02:22,380
hierarchy of argument are you at and if
 

6789
02:02:22,380 --> 02:02:24,229
hierarchy of argument are you at and if
it's ad hominem like okay cool I turned

6790
02:02:24,229 --> 02:02:24,239
it's ad hominem like okay cool I turned
 

6791
02:02:24,239 --> 02:02:27,229
it's ad hominem like okay cool I turned
on the no ad hominem filter

6792
02:02:27,229 --> 02:02:27,239
on the no ad hominem filter
 

6793
02:02:27,239 --> 02:02:28,850
on the no ad hominem filter
I wonder if there's a social network

6794
02:02:28,850 --> 02:02:28,860
I wonder if there's a social network
 

6795
02:02:28,860 --> 02:02:30,470
I wonder if there's a social network
that will allow you to have that kind of

6796
02:02:30,470 --> 02:02:30,480
that will allow you to have that kind of
 

6797
02:02:30,480 --> 02:02:34,129
that will allow you to have that kind of
filter yeah so uh here's a problem with

6798
02:02:34,129 --> 02:02:34,139
filter yeah so uh here's a problem with
 

6799
02:02:34,139 --> 02:02:35,450
filter yeah so uh here's a problem with
that

6800
02:02:35,450 --> 02:02:35,460
that
 

6801
02:02:35,460 --> 02:02:37,490
that
um it's not going to win in a free

6802
02:02:37,490 --> 02:02:37,500
um it's not going to win in a free
 

6803
02:02:37,500 --> 02:02:38,810
um it's not going to win in a free
market

6804
02:02:38,810 --> 02:02:38,820
market
 

6805
02:02:38,820 --> 02:02:40,609
market
what wins in a free market is all

6806
02:02:40,609 --> 02:02:40,619
what wins in a free market is all
 

6807
02:02:40,619 --> 02:02:42,050
what wins in a free market is all
television today is reality television

6808
02:02:42,050 --> 02:02:42,060
television today is reality television
 

6809
02:02:42,060 --> 02:02:43,370
television today is reality television
because it's engaging

6810
02:02:43,370 --> 02:02:43,380
because it's engaging
 

6811
02:02:43,380 --> 02:02:46,250
because it's engaging
right if if engaging is what wins in a

6812
02:02:46,250 --> 02:02:46,260
right if if engaging is what wins in a
 

6813
02:02:46,260 --> 02:02:48,709
right if if engaging is what wins in a
free market right so it becomes hard to

6814
02:02:48,709 --> 02:02:48,719
free market right so it becomes hard to
 

6815
02:02:48,719 --> 02:02:52,689
free market right so it becomes hard to
keep these other more nuanced values

6816
02:02:52,689 --> 02:02:52,699

 

6817
02:02:52,699 --> 02:02:55,729

well okay so that's the experience of

6818
02:02:55,729 --> 02:02:55,739
well okay so that's the experience of
 

6819
02:02:55,739 --> 02:02:57,229
well okay so that's the experience of
being on Twitter but then you got a

6820
02:02:57,229 --> 02:02:57,239
being on Twitter but then you got a
 

6821
02:02:57,239 --> 02:02:58,669
being on Twitter but then you got a
chance to also

6822
02:02:58,669 --> 02:02:58,679
chance to also
 

6823
02:02:58,679 --> 02:03:01,250
chance to also
together with other engineers and with

6824
02:03:01,250 --> 02:03:01,260
together with other engineers and with
 

6825
02:03:01,260 --> 02:03:03,470
together with other engineers and with
Elon sort of look brainstorm when you

6826
02:03:03,470 --> 02:03:03,480
Elon sort of look brainstorm when you
 

6827
02:03:03,480 --> 02:03:05,330
Elon sort of look brainstorm when you
step into a code base it's been around

6828
02:03:05,330 --> 02:03:05,340
step into a code base it's been around
 

6829
02:03:05,340 --> 02:03:07,250
step into a code base it's been around
for a long time you know there's other

6830
02:03:07,250 --> 02:03:07,260
for a long time you know there's other
 

6831
02:03:07,260 --> 02:03:09,350
for a long time you know there's other
social networks you know Facebook this

6832
02:03:09,350 --> 02:03:09,360
social networks you know Facebook this
 

6833
02:03:09,360 --> 02:03:12,169
social networks you know Facebook this
is old code basis and you step in and

6834
02:03:12,169 --> 02:03:12,179
is old code basis and you step in and
 

6835
02:03:12,179 --> 02:03:13,250
is old code basis and you step in and
see okay

6836
02:03:13,250 --> 02:03:13,260
see okay
 

6837
02:03:13,260 --> 02:03:16,790
see okay
how do we make with a fresh mind uh

6838
02:03:16,790 --> 02:03:16,800
how do we make with a fresh mind uh
 

6839
02:03:16,800 --> 02:03:18,229
how do we make with a fresh mind uh
progress on this code base like what

6840
02:03:18,229 --> 02:03:18,239
progress on this code base like what
 

6841
02:03:18,239 --> 02:03:19,609
progress on this code base like what
what did you learn about software

6842
02:03:19,609 --> 02:03:19,619
what did you learn about software
 

6843
02:03:19,619 --> 02:03:21,229
what did you learn about software
engineering about programming from just

6844
02:03:21,229 --> 02:03:21,239
engineering about programming from just
 

6845
02:03:21,239 --> 02:03:23,930
engineering about programming from just
experiencing that so my technical

6846
02:03:23,930 --> 02:03:23,940
experiencing that so my technical
 

6847
02:03:23,940 --> 02:03:25,910
experiencing that so my technical
recommendation to Elon and I said this

6848
02:03:25,910 --> 02:03:25,920
recommendation to Elon and I said this
 

6849
02:03:25,920 --> 02:03:27,589
recommendation to Elon and I said this
on the Twitter spaces afterward I said

6850
02:03:27,589 --> 02:03:27,599
on the Twitter spaces afterward I said
 

6851
02:03:27,599 --> 02:03:30,470
on the Twitter spaces afterward I said
this many times during my brief

6852
02:03:30,470 --> 02:03:30,480
this many times during my brief
 

6853
02:03:30,480 --> 02:03:32,270
this many times during my brief
internship

6854
02:03:32,270 --> 02:03:32,280
internship
 

6855
02:03:32,280 --> 02:03:33,050
internship
um

6856
02:03:33,050 --> 02:03:33,060
um
 

6857
02:03:33,060 --> 02:03:35,689
um
was that you need refactors before

6858
02:03:35,689 --> 02:03:35,699
was that you need refactors before
 

6859
02:03:35,699 --> 02:03:37,669
was that you need refactors before
features

6860
02:03:37,669 --> 02:03:37,679
features
 

6861
02:03:37,679 --> 02:03:40,490
features
um this code base was and look I've

6862
02:03:40,490 --> 02:03:40,500
um this code base was and look I've
 

6863
02:03:40,500 --> 02:03:41,510
um this code base was and look I've
worked at Google I've worked at Facebook

6864
02:03:41,510 --> 02:03:41,520
worked at Google I've worked at Facebook
 

6865
02:03:41,520 --> 02:03:44,209
worked at Google I've worked at Facebook
uh Facebook has the best code

6866
02:03:44,209 --> 02:03:44,219
uh Facebook has the best code
 

6867
02:03:44,219 --> 02:03:46,669
uh Facebook has the best code
uh then Google then Twitter

6868
02:03:46,669 --> 02:03:46,679
uh then Google then Twitter
 

6869
02:03:46,679 --> 02:03:48,410
uh then Google then Twitter
um and you know what you can know this

6870
02:03:48,410 --> 02:03:48,420
um and you know what you can know this
 

6871
02:03:48,420 --> 02:03:49,550
um and you know what you can know this
because look at the machine learning

6872
02:03:49,550 --> 02:03:49,560
because look at the machine learning
 

6873
02:03:49,560 --> 02:03:50,990
because look at the machine learning
Frameworks right Facebook released Pi

6874
02:03:50,990 --> 02:03:51,000
Frameworks right Facebook released Pi
 

6875
02:03:51,000 --> 02:03:52,609
Frameworks right Facebook released Pi
torch Google release tensorflow and

6876
02:03:52,609 --> 02:03:52,619
torch Google release tensorflow and
 

6877
02:03:52,619 --> 02:03:55,490
torch Google release tensorflow and
Twitter released

6878
02:03:55,490 --> 02:03:55,500

 

6879
02:03:55,500 --> 02:03:58,790

okay so you know it's a proxy but yeah

6880
02:03:58,790 --> 02:03:58,800
okay so you know it's a proxy but yeah
 

6881
02:03:58,800 --> 02:04:00,589
okay so you know it's a proxy but yeah
they're the the Google code base is

6882
02:04:00,589 --> 02:04:00,599
they're the the Google code base is
 

6883
02:04:00,599 --> 02:04:01,669
they're the the Google code base is
quite interesting there's a lot of

6884
02:04:01,669 --> 02:04:01,679
quite interesting there's a lot of
 

6885
02:04:01,679 --> 02:04:02,990
quite interesting there's a lot of
really good software Engineers there but

6886
02:04:02,990 --> 02:04:03,000
really good software Engineers there but
 

6887
02:04:03,000 --> 02:04:05,209
really good software Engineers there but
the code base is very large the code

6888
02:04:05,209 --> 02:04:05,219
the code base is very large the code
 

6889
02:04:05,219 --> 02:04:08,030
the code base is very large the code
base was good in 20 in 2005. right it

6890
02:04:08,030 --> 02:04:08,040
base was good in 20 in 2005. right it
 

6891
02:04:08,040 --> 02:04:09,470
base was good in 20 in 2005. right it
looks like 2005. there's so many

6892
02:04:09,470 --> 02:04:09,480
looks like 2005. there's so many
 

6893
02:04:09,480 --> 02:04:10,970
looks like 2005. there's so many
products so many teams right it's very

6894
02:04:10,970 --> 02:04:10,980
products so many teams right it's very
 

6895
02:04:10,980 --> 02:04:12,649
products so many teams right it's very
difficult to

6896
02:04:12,649 --> 02:04:12,659
difficult to
 

6897
02:04:12,659 --> 02:04:15,530
difficult to
um I feel like Twitter does less like

6898
02:04:15,530 --> 02:04:15,540
um I feel like Twitter does less like
 

6899
02:04:15,540 --> 02:04:18,890
um I feel like Twitter does less like
obviously much less than Google

6900
02:04:18,890 --> 02:04:18,900
obviously much less than Google
 

6901
02:04:18,900 --> 02:04:21,649
obviously much less than Google
in terms of like the set of features

6902
02:04:21,649 --> 02:04:21,659
in terms of like the set of features
 

6903
02:04:21,659 --> 02:04:23,330
in terms of like the set of features
right

6904
02:04:23,330 --> 02:04:23,340
right
 

6905
02:04:23,340 --> 02:04:26,149
right
so like it's I can imagine the number of

6906
02:04:26,149 --> 02:04:26,159
so like it's I can imagine the number of
 

6907
02:04:26,159 --> 02:04:28,430
so like it's I can imagine the number of
software Engineers that could recreate

6908
02:04:28,430 --> 02:04:28,440
software Engineers that could recreate
 

6909
02:04:28,440 --> 02:04:30,350
software Engineers that could recreate
Twitter is much smaller than to recreate

6910
02:04:30,350 --> 02:04:30,360
Twitter is much smaller than to recreate
 

6911
02:04:30,360 --> 02:04:32,930
Twitter is much smaller than to recreate
Google yeah I still believe in the

6912
02:04:32,930 --> 02:04:32,940
Google yeah I still believe in the
 

6913
02:04:32,940 --> 02:04:34,850
Google yeah I still believe in the
amount of hate I got for saying this

6914
02:04:34,850 --> 02:04:34,860
amount of hate I got for saying this
 

6915
02:04:34,860 --> 02:04:37,250
amount of hate I got for saying this
that 50 people could build and maintain

6916
02:04:37,250 --> 02:04:37,260
that 50 people could build and maintain
 

6917
02:04:37,260 --> 02:04:39,709
that 50 people could build and maintain
Twitter uh pretty what's the nature of

6918
02:04:39,709 --> 02:04:39,719
Twitter uh pretty what's the nature of
 

6919
02:04:39,719 --> 02:04:41,689
Twitter uh pretty what's the nature of
the hate comfortably

6920
02:04:41,689 --> 02:04:41,699
the hate comfortably
 

6921
02:04:41,699 --> 02:04:42,890
the hate comfortably
that you don't know what you're talking

6922
02:04:42,890 --> 02:04:42,900
that you don't know what you're talking
 

6923
02:04:42,900 --> 02:04:44,689
that you don't know what you're talking
about you know what it is and it's the

6924
02:04:44,689 --> 02:04:44,699
about you know what it is and it's the
 

6925
02:04:44,699 --> 02:04:46,189
about you know what it is and it's the
same this is my summary of like the hate

6926
02:04:46,189 --> 02:04:46,199
same this is my summary of like the hate
 

6927
02:04:46,199 --> 02:04:49,010
same this is my summary of like the hate
I get on Hacker News it's like

6928
02:04:49,010 --> 02:04:49,020
I get on Hacker News it's like
 

6929
02:04:49,020 --> 02:04:51,229
I get on Hacker News it's like
when I say I'm going to do something

6930
02:04:51,229 --> 02:04:51,239
when I say I'm going to do something
 

6931
02:04:51,239 --> 02:04:53,689
when I say I'm going to do something
they

6932
02:04:53,689 --> 02:04:53,699
they
 

6933
02:04:53,699 --> 02:04:55,609
they
have to believe that it's impossible

6934
02:04:55,609 --> 02:04:55,619
have to believe that it's impossible
 

6935
02:04:55,619 --> 02:04:58,609
have to believe that it's impossible
yeah because if doing things was

6936
02:04:58,609 --> 02:04:58,619
yeah because if doing things was
 

6937
02:04:58,619 --> 02:05:00,830
yeah because if doing things was
possible they'd have to do some soul

6938
02:05:00,830 --> 02:05:00,840
possible they'd have to do some soul
 

6939
02:05:00,840 --> 02:05:02,450
possible they'd have to do some soul
searching and ask the question why

6940
02:05:02,450 --> 02:05:02,460
searching and ask the question why
 

6941
02:05:02,460 --> 02:05:04,250
searching and ask the question why
didn't they do anything so when you say

6942
02:05:04,250 --> 02:05:04,260
didn't they do anything so when you say
 

6943
02:05:04,260 --> 02:05:05,990
didn't they do anything so when you say
and I do say that's where the hate comes

6944
02:05:05,990 --> 02:05:06,000
and I do say that's where the hate comes
 

6945
02:05:06,000 --> 02:05:07,790
and I do say that's where the hate comes
from when you say well there's a core

6946
02:05:07,790 --> 02:05:07,800
from when you say well there's a core
 

6947
02:05:07,800 --> 02:05:09,169
from when you say well there's a core
truth to that yeah so when you say I'm

6948
02:05:09,169 --> 02:05:09,179
truth to that yeah so when you say I'm
 

6949
02:05:09,179 --> 02:05:11,810
truth to that yeah so when you say I'm
going to solve self-driving

6950
02:05:11,810 --> 02:05:11,820
going to solve self-driving
 

6951
02:05:11,820 --> 02:05:14,089
going to solve self-driving
people go like what are your credentials

6952
02:05:14,089 --> 02:05:14,099
people go like what are your credentials
 

6953
02:05:14,099 --> 02:05:15,589
people go like what are your credentials
what the hell are you talking about what

6954
02:05:15,589 --> 02:05:15,599
what the hell are you talking about what
 

6955
02:05:15,599 --> 02:05:17,209
what the hell are you talking about what
is this is extremely difficult problem

6956
02:05:17,209 --> 02:05:17,219
is this is extremely difficult problem
 

6957
02:05:17,219 --> 02:05:18,530
is this is extremely difficult problem
of course you're a noob that doesn't

6958
02:05:18,530 --> 02:05:18,540
of course you're a noob that doesn't
 

6959
02:05:18,540 --> 02:05:21,470
of course you're a noob that doesn't
understand the problem deeply

6960
02:05:21,470 --> 02:05:21,480
understand the problem deeply
 

6961
02:05:21,480 --> 02:05:23,629
understand the problem deeply
um I mean that that was the same nature

6962
02:05:23,629 --> 02:05:23,639
um I mean that that was the same nature
 

6963
02:05:23,639 --> 02:05:25,189
um I mean that that was the same nature
of hate that probably Elon got when you

6964
02:05:25,189 --> 02:05:25,199
of hate that probably Elon got when you
 

6965
02:05:25,199 --> 02:05:27,709
of hate that probably Elon got when you
first talked about until I was driving

6966
02:05:27,709 --> 02:05:27,719
first talked about until I was driving
 

6967
02:05:27,719 --> 02:05:30,109
first talked about until I was driving
uh but you know there's pros and cons to

6968
02:05:30,109 --> 02:05:30,119
uh but you know there's pros and cons to
 

6969
02:05:30,119 --> 02:05:31,430
uh but you know there's pros and cons to
that because like you know there is

6970
02:05:31,430 --> 02:05:31,440
that because like you know there is
 

6971
02:05:31,440 --> 02:05:32,870
that because like you know there is
experts in this world

6972
02:05:32,870 --> 02:05:32,880
experts in this world
 

6973
02:05:32,880 --> 02:05:35,570
experts in this world
no but the mockers aren't experts the

6974
02:05:35,570 --> 02:05:35,580
no but the mockers aren't experts the
 

6975
02:05:35,580 --> 02:05:37,430
no but the mockers aren't experts the
market the the people who are mocking

6976
02:05:37,430 --> 02:05:37,440
market the the people who are mocking
 

6977
02:05:37,440 --> 02:05:39,410
market the the people who are mocking
are not experts with carefully reasoned

6978
02:05:39,410 --> 02:05:39,420
are not experts with carefully reasoned
 

6979
02:05:39,420 --> 02:05:40,970
are not experts with carefully reasoned
arguments about why you need 8 000

6980
02:05:40,970 --> 02:05:40,980
arguments about why you need 8 000
 

6981
02:05:40,980 --> 02:05:43,370
arguments about why you need 8 000
people to run a bird app there but the

6982
02:05:43,370 --> 02:05:43,380
people to run a bird app there but the
 

6983
02:05:43,380 --> 02:05:46,189
people to run a bird app there but the
people are gonna lose their jobs

6984
02:05:46,189 --> 02:05:46,199
people are gonna lose their jobs
 

6985
02:05:46,199 --> 02:05:48,410
people are gonna lose their jobs
well that but also there's the software

6986
02:05:48,410 --> 02:05:48,420
well that but also there's the software
 

6987
02:05:48,420 --> 02:05:49,669
well that but also there's the software
Engineers that probably could have says

6988
02:05:49,669 --> 02:05:49,679
Engineers that probably could have says
 

6989
02:05:49,679 --> 02:05:51,290
Engineers that probably could have says
no it's a lot more complicated than you

6990
02:05:51,290 --> 02:05:51,300
no it's a lot more complicated than you
 

6991
02:05:51,300 --> 02:05:52,970
no it's a lot more complicated than you
realize but maybe it doesn't need to be

6992
02:05:52,970 --> 02:05:52,980
realize but maybe it doesn't need to be
 

6993
02:05:52,980 --> 02:05:55,430
realize but maybe it doesn't need to be
so complicated you know some people in

6994
02:05:55,430 --> 02:05:55,440
so complicated you know some people in
 

6995
02:05:55,440 --> 02:05:57,169
so complicated you know some people in
the world like to create complexity some

6996
02:05:57,169 --> 02:05:57,179
the world like to create complexity some
 

6997
02:05:57,179 --> 02:05:58,189
the world like to create complexity some
people in the world Thrive under

6998
02:05:58,189 --> 02:05:58,199
people in the world Thrive under
 

6999
02:05:58,199 --> 02:06:00,050
people in the world Thrive under
complexity like lawyers right lawyers

7000
02:06:00,050 --> 02:06:00,060
complexity like lawyers right lawyers
 

7001
02:06:00,060 --> 02:06:01,189
complexity like lawyers right lawyers
want the world to be more complex

7002
02:06:01,189 --> 02:06:01,199
want the world to be more complex
 

7003
02:06:01,199 --> 02:06:02,270
want the world to be more complex
because you need more lawyers you need

7004
02:06:02,270 --> 02:06:02,280
because you need more lawyers you need
 

7005
02:06:02,280 --> 02:06:04,970
because you need more lawyers you need
more legal hours right

7006
02:06:04,970 --> 02:06:04,980
more legal hours right
 

7007
02:06:04,980 --> 02:06:06,530
more legal hours right
um I think that's another if there's two

7008
02:06:06,530 --> 02:06:06,540
um I think that's another if there's two
 

7009
02:06:06,540 --> 02:06:07,729
um I think that's another if there's two
great evils in the world it's

7010
02:06:07,729 --> 02:06:07,739
great evils in the world it's
 

7011
02:06:07,739 --> 02:06:09,830
great evils in the world it's
centralization and complexity yeah and

7012
02:06:09,830 --> 02:06:09,840
centralization and complexity yeah and
 

7013
02:06:09,840 --> 02:06:13,430
centralization and complexity yeah and
uh the the one of the sort of hidden

7014
02:06:13,430 --> 02:06:13,440
uh the the one of the sort of hidden
 

7015
02:06:13,440 --> 02:06:15,830
uh the the one of the sort of hidden
uh side effects of software engineering

7016
02:06:15,830 --> 02:06:15,840
uh side effects of software engineering
 

7017
02:06:15,840 --> 02:06:18,470
uh side effects of software engineering
is

7018
02:06:18,470 --> 02:06:18,480

 

7019
02:06:18,480 --> 02:06:21,609

um like finding pleasure and complexity

7020
02:06:21,609 --> 02:06:21,619
um like finding pleasure and complexity
 

7021
02:06:21,619 --> 02:06:24,589
um like finding pleasure and complexity
I mean I don't remember just taking all

7022
02:06:24,589 --> 02:06:24,599
I mean I don't remember just taking all
 

7023
02:06:24,599 --> 02:06:25,970
I mean I don't remember just taking all
the software engineering courses and

7024
02:06:25,970 --> 02:06:25,980
the software engineering courses and
 

7025
02:06:25,980 --> 02:06:27,950
the software engineering courses and
just doing programming and this is just

7026
02:06:27,950 --> 02:06:27,960
just doing programming and this is just
 

7027
02:06:27,960 --> 02:06:30,589
just doing programming and this is just
coming up in this uh

7028
02:06:30,589 --> 02:06:30,599
coming up in this uh
 

7029
02:06:30,599 --> 02:06:32,689
coming up in this uh
uh object-oriented programming kind of

7030
02:06:32,689 --> 02:06:32,699
uh object-oriented programming kind of
 

7031
02:06:32,699 --> 02:06:35,209
uh object-oriented programming kind of
idea you don't like not often do people

7032
02:06:35,209 --> 02:06:35,219
idea you don't like not often do people
 

7033
02:06:35,219 --> 02:06:37,669
idea you don't like not often do people
tell you like do the simplest possible

7034
02:06:37,669 --> 02:06:37,679
tell you like do the simplest possible
 

7035
02:06:37,679 --> 02:06:42,050
tell you like do the simplest possible
thing like like a professor a teacher is

7036
02:06:42,050 --> 02:06:42,060
thing like like a professor a teacher is
 

7037
02:06:42,060 --> 02:06:44,149
thing like like a professor a teacher is
not going to get in front like this is

7038
02:06:44,149 --> 02:06:44,159
not going to get in front like this is
 

7039
02:06:44,159 --> 02:06:45,890
not going to get in front like this is
the simplest way to do it they'll say

7040
02:06:45,890 --> 02:06:45,900
the simplest way to do it they'll say
 

7041
02:06:45,900 --> 02:06:47,510
the simplest way to do it they'll say
like this is direct there's the right

7042
02:06:47,510 --> 02:06:47,520
like this is direct there's the right
 

7043
02:06:47,520 --> 02:06:49,729
like this is direct there's the right
way and the right way at least for a

7044
02:06:49,729 --> 02:06:49,739
way and the right way at least for a
 

7045
02:06:49,739 --> 02:06:51,830
way and the right way at least for a
long time you know especially I came up

7046
02:06:51,830 --> 02:06:51,840
long time you know especially I came up
 

7047
02:06:51,840 --> 02:06:55,129
long time you know especially I came up
with like Java right like is is there's

7048
02:06:55,129 --> 02:06:55,139
with like Java right like is is there's
 

7049
02:06:55,139 --> 02:06:57,709
with like Java right like is is there's
so much boilerplate so much like

7050
02:06:57,709 --> 02:06:57,719
so much boilerplate so much like
 

7051
02:06:57,719 --> 02:07:01,430
so much boilerplate so much like
so many classes so many like designs and

7052
02:07:01,430 --> 02:07:01,440
so many classes so many like designs and
 

7053
02:07:01,440 --> 02:07:03,229
so many classes so many like designs and
architectures and so on like planning

7054
02:07:03,229 --> 02:07:03,239
architectures and so on like planning
 

7055
02:07:03,239 --> 02:07:06,290
architectures and so on like planning
for features far into the future and

7056
02:07:06,290 --> 02:07:06,300
for features far into the future and
 

7057
02:07:06,300 --> 02:07:07,970
for features far into the future and
planning poorly and all this kind of

7058
02:07:07,970 --> 02:07:07,980
planning poorly and all this kind of
 

7059
02:07:07,980 --> 02:07:09,709
planning poorly and all this kind of
stuff and then there's this like code

7060
02:07:09,709 --> 02:07:09,719
stuff and then there's this like code
 

7061
02:07:09,719 --> 02:07:11,450
stuff and then there's this like code
base that follows you along and puts

7062
02:07:11,450 --> 02:07:11,460
base that follows you along and puts
 

7063
02:07:11,460 --> 02:07:14,450
base that follows you along and puts
pressure on you and nobody knows what

7064
02:07:14,450 --> 02:07:14,460
pressure on you and nobody knows what
 

7065
02:07:14,460 --> 02:07:16,250
pressure on you and nobody knows what
like Parts different parts do which

7066
02:07:16,250 --> 02:07:16,260
like Parts different parts do which
 

7067
02:07:16,260 --> 02:07:17,689
like Parts different parts do which
slows everything down is the kind of

7068
02:07:17,689 --> 02:07:17,699
slows everything down is the kind of
 

7069
02:07:17,699 --> 02:07:19,850
slows everything down is the kind of
bureaucracy that's instilled in the code

7070
02:07:19,850 --> 02:07:19,860
bureaucracy that's instilled in the code
 

7071
02:07:19,860 --> 02:07:21,649
bureaucracy that's instilled in the code
as a result of that but then you feel

7072
02:07:21,649 --> 02:07:21,659
as a result of that but then you feel
 

7073
02:07:21,659 --> 02:07:24,050
as a result of that but then you feel
like oh well I follow a good software

7074
02:07:24,050 --> 02:07:24,060
like oh well I follow a good software
 

7075
02:07:24,060 --> 02:07:25,910
like oh well I follow a good software
engineering practices it's an

7076
02:07:25,910 --> 02:07:25,920
engineering practices it's an
 

7077
02:07:25,920 --> 02:07:26,930
engineering practices it's an
interesting trade-off because then you

7078
02:07:26,930 --> 02:07:26,940
interesting trade-off because then you
 

7079
02:07:26,940 --> 02:07:29,330
interesting trade-off because then you
look at like the ghetto-ness of like

7080
02:07:29,330 --> 02:07:29,340
look at like the ghetto-ness of like
 

7081
02:07:29,340 --> 02:07:32,209
look at like the ghetto-ness of like
Pearl and the old like how quickly you

7082
02:07:32,209 --> 02:07:32,219
Pearl and the old like how quickly you
 

7083
02:07:32,219 --> 02:07:33,410
Pearl and the old like how quickly you
could just write a couple lines and just

7084
02:07:33,410 --> 02:07:33,420
could just write a couple lines and just
 

7085
02:07:33,420 --> 02:07:35,629
could just write a couple lines and just
get stuff done that trade-off is

7086
02:07:35,629 --> 02:07:35,639
get stuff done that trade-off is
 

7087
02:07:35,639 --> 02:07:37,729
get stuff done that trade-off is
interesting or bash or whatever these

7088
02:07:37,729 --> 02:07:37,739
interesting or bash or whatever these
 

7089
02:07:37,739 --> 02:07:38,990
interesting or bash or whatever these
kind of ghetto things you can do in

7090
02:07:38,990 --> 02:07:39,000
kind of ghetto things you can do in
 

7091
02:07:39,000 --> 02:07:41,270
kind of ghetto things you can do in
Linux one of my favorite things to look

7092
02:07:41,270 --> 02:07:41,280
Linux one of my favorite things to look
 

7093
02:07:41,280 --> 02:07:43,010
Linux one of my favorite things to look
at today is how much do you trust your

7094
02:07:43,010 --> 02:07:43,020
at today is how much do you trust your
 

7095
02:07:43,020 --> 02:07:45,350
at today is how much do you trust your
tests right we've put a ton of effort in

7096
02:07:45,350 --> 02:07:45,360
tests right we've put a ton of effort in
 

7097
02:07:45,360 --> 02:07:46,970
tests right we've put a ton of effort in
comma and I put a ton of effort in tiny

7098
02:07:46,970 --> 02:07:46,980
comma and I put a ton of effort in tiny
 

7099
02:07:46,980 --> 02:07:49,609
comma and I put a ton of effort in tiny
grad into making sure if you change the

7100
02:07:49,609 --> 02:07:49,619
grad into making sure if you change the
 

7101
02:07:49,619 --> 02:07:51,950
grad into making sure if you change the
code and the tests pass that you didn't

7102
02:07:51,950 --> 02:07:51,960
code and the tests pass that you didn't
 

7103
02:07:51,960 --> 02:07:53,570
code and the tests pass that you didn't
break the code yeah now this obviously

7104
02:07:53,570 --> 02:07:53,580
break the code yeah now this obviously
 

7105
02:07:53,580 --> 02:07:54,950
break the code yeah now this obviously
is not always true

7106
02:07:54,950 --> 02:07:54,960
is not always true
 

7107
02:07:54,960 --> 02:07:57,229
is not always true
but the closer that is to true the more

7108
02:07:57,229 --> 02:07:57,239
but the closer that is to true the more
 

7109
02:07:57,239 --> 02:07:58,669
but the closer that is to true the more
you trust your tests the more you're

7110
02:07:58,669 --> 02:07:58,679
you trust your tests the more you're
 

7111
02:07:58,679 --> 02:08:00,109
you trust your tests the more you're
like oh I got a pull request and the

7112
02:08:00,109 --> 02:08:00,119
like oh I got a pull request and the
 

7113
02:08:00,119 --> 02:08:02,689
like oh I got a pull request and the
tests pass I feel okay to merge that the

7114
02:08:02,689 --> 02:08:02,699
tests pass I feel okay to merge that the
 

7115
02:08:02,699 --> 02:08:04,189

faster you can make progress CEO is

7116
02:08:04,189 --> 02:08:04,199
faster you can make progress CEO is

programming with tests of mine

7118
02:08:05,209 --> 02:08:05,219
programming with tests of mine
 

7119
02:08:05,219 --> 02:08:07,490
programming with tests of mine
developing tests with that in mind that

7120
02:08:07,490 --> 02:08:07,500
developing tests with that in mind that
 

7121
02:08:07,500 --> 02:08:09,050
developing tests with that in mind that
if it passes it should be good and

7122
02:08:09,050 --> 02:08:09,060
if it passes it should be good and
 

7123
02:08:09,060 --> 02:08:12,229
if it passes it should be good and
Twitter not that

7124
02:08:12,229 --> 02:08:12,239
Twitter not that
 

7125
02:08:12,239 --> 02:08:14,450
Twitter not that
so it was impossible to make progress in

7126
02:08:14,450 --> 02:08:14,460
so it was impossible to make progress in
 

7127
02:08:14,460 --> 02:08:16,669
so it was impossible to make progress in
the code base what other stuff can you

7128
02:08:16,669 --> 02:08:16,679
the code base what other stuff can you
 

7129
02:08:16,679 --> 02:08:17,930
the code base what other stuff can you
say about the code base that made it

7130
02:08:17,930 --> 02:08:17,940
say about the code base that made it
 

7131
02:08:17,940 --> 02:08:20,209
say about the code base that made it
difficult uh like what are some

7132
02:08:20,209 --> 02:08:20,219
difficult uh like what are some
 

7133
02:08:20,219 --> 02:08:22,129
difficult uh like what are some
interesting sort of quirks broadly

7134
02:08:22,129 --> 02:08:22,139
interesting sort of quirks broadly
 

7135
02:08:22,139 --> 02:08:25,250
interesting sort of quirks broadly
speaking from that compared to just your

7136
02:08:25,250 --> 02:08:25,260
speaking from that compared to just your
 

7137
02:08:25,260 --> 02:08:27,470
speaking from that compared to just your
experience with comma and everywhere

7138
02:08:27,470 --> 02:08:27,480
experience with comma and everywhere
 

7139
02:08:27,480 --> 02:08:30,229
experience with comma and everywhere
else the real thing that I spoke to a

7140
02:08:30,229 --> 02:08:30,239
else the real thing that I spoke to a
 

7141
02:08:30,239 --> 02:08:31,729

bunch of uh

7142
02:08:31,729 --> 02:08:31,739
bunch of uh
 

7143
02:08:31,739 --> 02:08:33,770
bunch of uh
you know like like individual

7144
02:08:33,770 --> 02:08:33,780
you know like like individual
 

7145
02:08:33,780 --> 02:08:35,870
you know like like individual
contributors to Twitter and I just I had

7146
02:08:35,870 --> 02:08:35,880
contributors to Twitter and I just I had
 

7147
02:08:35,880 --> 02:08:37,970
contributors to Twitter and I just I had
staffed I'm like okay so like what's

7148
02:08:37,970 --> 02:08:37,980
staffed I'm like okay so like what's
 

7149
02:08:37,980 --> 02:08:39,109
staffed I'm like okay so like what's
wrong with this place why does this code

7150
02:08:39,109 --> 02:08:39,119
wrong with this place why does this code
 

7151
02:08:39,119 --> 02:08:41,030
wrong with this place why does this code
look like this and they explained to me

7152
02:08:41,030 --> 02:08:41,040
look like this and they explained to me
 

7153
02:08:41,040 --> 02:08:43,430
look like this and they explained to me
what Twitter's promotion system was

7154
02:08:43,430 --> 02:08:43,440
what Twitter's promotion system was
 

7155
02:08:43,440 --> 02:08:45,050
what Twitter's promotion system was
the way that you got promoted to Twitter

7156
02:08:45,050 --> 02:08:45,060
the way that you got promoted to Twitter
 

7157
02:08:45,060 --> 02:08:47,089
the way that you got promoted to Twitter
was you wrote a library that a lot of

7158
02:08:47,089 --> 02:08:47,099
was you wrote a library that a lot of
 

7159
02:08:47,099 --> 02:08:49,070
was you wrote a library that a lot of
people used

7160
02:08:49,070 --> 02:08:49,080
people used
 

7161
02:08:49,080 --> 02:08:50,510
people used
right

7162
02:08:50,510 --> 02:08:50,520
right
 

7163
02:08:50,520 --> 02:08:53,390
right
so some guy wrote an nginx replacement

7164
02:08:53,390 --> 02:08:53,400
so some guy wrote an nginx replacement
 

7165
02:08:53,400 --> 02:08:55,550
so some guy wrote an nginx replacement
for Twitter why does Twitter need an

7166
02:08:55,550 --> 02:08:55,560
for Twitter why does Twitter need an
 

7167
02:08:55,560 --> 02:08:57,109
for Twitter why does Twitter need an
nginx replacement what was wrong with

7168
02:08:57,109 --> 02:08:57,119
nginx replacement what was wrong with
 

7169
02:08:57,119 --> 02:08:58,310
nginx replacement what was wrong with
nginx

7170
02:08:58,310 --> 02:08:58,320
nginx
 

7171
02:08:58,320 --> 02:08:59,810
nginx
well you see you're not going to get

7172
02:08:59,810 --> 02:08:59,820
well you see you're not going to get
 

7173
02:08:59,820 --> 02:09:02,330
well you see you're not going to get
promoted if you use nginx but if you

7174
02:09:02,330 --> 02:09:02,340
promoted if you use nginx but if you
 

7175
02:09:02,340 --> 02:09:04,070
promoted if you use nginx but if you
write a replacement and lots of people

7176
02:09:04,070 --> 02:09:04,080
write a replacement and lots of people
 

7177
02:09:04,080 --> 02:09:06,109
write a replacement and lots of people
start using it as the Twitter front end

7178
02:09:06,109 --> 02:09:06,119
start using it as the Twitter front end
 

7179
02:09:06,119 --> 02:09:07,729
start using it as the Twitter front end
for their product then you're going to

7180
02:09:07,729 --> 02:09:07,739
for their product then you're going to
 

7181
02:09:07,739 --> 02:09:08,990
for their product then you're going to
get promoted right so interesting

7182
02:09:08,990 --> 02:09:09,000
get promoted right so interesting
 

7183
02:09:09,000 --> 02:09:10,609
get promoted right so interesting
because like from an individual

7184
02:09:10,609 --> 02:09:10,619
because like from an individual
 

7185
02:09:10,619 --> 02:09:13,370
because like from an individual
perspective how do you incentivize

7186
02:09:13,370 --> 02:09:13,380
perspective how do you incentivize
 

7187
02:09:13,380 --> 02:09:14,930
perspective how do you incentivize
how do you create the kind of incentives

7188
02:09:14,930 --> 02:09:14,940
how do you create the kind of incentives
 

7189
02:09:14,940 --> 02:09:17,089
how do you create the kind of incentives
that will reach or lead to a great code

7190
02:09:17,089 --> 02:09:17,099
that will reach or lead to a great code
 

7191
02:09:17,099 --> 02:09:19,250
that will reach or lead to a great code
base what's okay what's the answer to

7192
02:09:19,250 --> 02:09:19,260
base what's okay what's the answer to
 

7193
02:09:19,260 --> 02:09:20,350
base what's okay what's the answer to
that

7194
02:09:20,350 --> 02:09:20,360
that
 

7195
02:09:20,360 --> 02:09:25,189
that
so what I do at comma and at uh

7196
02:09:25,189 --> 02:09:25,199
so what I do at comma and at uh
 

7197
02:09:25,199 --> 02:09:27,709
so what I do at comma and at uh
and you know at tiny Corp is you have to

7198
02:09:27,709 --> 02:09:27,719
and you know at tiny Corp is you have to
 

7199
02:09:27,719 --> 02:09:28,790
and you know at tiny Corp is you have to
explain it to me you have to explain to

7200
02:09:28,790 --> 02:09:28,800
explain it to me you have to explain to
 

7201
02:09:28,800 --> 02:09:30,890
explain it to me you have to explain to
me what this code does right and if I

7202
02:09:30,890 --> 02:09:30,900
me what this code does right and if I
 

7203
02:09:30,900 --> 02:09:32,990
me what this code does right and if I
can sit there and come up with a simpler

7204
02:09:32,990 --> 02:09:33,000
can sit there and come up with a simpler
 

7205
02:09:33,000 --> 02:09:35,450
can sit there and come up with a simpler
way to do it you have to rewrite it

7206
02:09:35,450 --> 02:09:35,460
way to do it you have to rewrite it
 

7207
02:09:35,460 --> 02:09:36,770
way to do it you have to rewrite it
you have to agree with me about the

7208
02:09:36,770 --> 02:09:36,780
you have to agree with me about the
 

7209
02:09:36,780 --> 02:09:38,030
you have to agree with me about the
simpler way I'm you know obviously we

7210
02:09:38,030 --> 02:09:38,040
simpler way I'm you know obviously we
 

7211
02:09:38,040 --> 02:09:39,290
simpler way I'm you know obviously we
can have a conversation about this it's

7212
02:09:39,290 --> 02:09:39,300
can have a conversation about this it's
 

7213
02:09:39,300 --> 02:09:41,570
can have a conversation about this it's
not a it's not dictatorial but if you're

7214
02:09:41,570 --> 02:09:41,580
not a it's not dictatorial but if you're
 

7215
02:09:41,580 --> 02:09:43,129
not a it's not dictatorial but if you're
like wow like that actually is way

7216
02:09:43,129 --> 02:09:43,139
like wow like that actually is way
 

7217
02:09:43,139 --> 02:09:44,209
like wow like that actually is way
simpler

7218
02:09:44,209 --> 02:09:44,219
simpler
 

7219
02:09:44,219 --> 02:09:47,270
simpler
like like the Simplicity is important

7220
02:09:47,270 --> 02:09:47,280
like like the Simplicity is important
 

7221
02:09:47,280 --> 02:09:49,370
like like the Simplicity is important
right but that requires people that

7222
02:09:49,370 --> 02:09:49,380
right but that requires people that
 

7223
02:09:49,380 --> 02:09:50,930
right but that requires people that
Overlook the code

7224
02:09:50,930 --> 02:09:50,940
Overlook the code
 

7225
02:09:50,940 --> 02:09:54,410
Overlook the code
at the highest levels to be like okay it

7226
02:09:54,410 --> 02:09:54,420
at the highest levels to be like okay it
 

7227
02:09:54,420 --> 02:09:55,729
at the highest levels to be like okay it
requires technical leadership you trust

7228
02:09:55,729 --> 02:09:55,739
requires technical leadership you trust
 

7229
02:09:55,739 --> 02:09:58,070
requires technical leadership you trust
yeah technical leadership

7230
02:09:58,070 --> 02:09:58,080
yeah technical leadership
 

7231
02:09:58,080 --> 02:10:00,589
yeah technical leadership
so managers or whatever should have to

7232
02:10:00,589 --> 02:10:00,599
so managers or whatever should have to
 

7233
02:10:00,599 --> 02:10:02,270
so managers or whatever should have to
have technical Savvy deep technical

7234
02:10:02,270 --> 02:10:02,280
have technical Savvy deep technical
 

7235
02:10:02,280 --> 02:10:04,010
have technical Savvy deep technical
Savvy managers should be better

7236
02:10:04,010 --> 02:10:04,020
Savvy managers should be better
 

7237
02:10:04,020 --> 02:10:05,209
Savvy managers should be better
programmers than the people who they

7238
02:10:05,209 --> 02:10:05,219
programmers than the people who they
 

7239
02:10:05,219 --> 02:10:06,709
programmers than the people who they

first of all identify the pieces and
 

7337
02:11:39,599 --> 02:11:41,510
first of all identify the pieces and
then put tests in between the pieces

7338
02:11:41,510 --> 02:11:41,520
then put tests in between the pieces
 

7339
02:11:41,520 --> 02:11:43,070
then put tests in between the pieces
right so there's all these different

7397
02:12:37,739 --> 02:12:40,430
is like oh man
it was fun it was fun it was stressful

7398
02:12:40,430 --> 02:12:40,440
it was fun it was fun it was stressful
 

7399
02:12:40,440 --> 02:12:41,870
it was fun it was fun it was stressful
but I felt like you know it was that

7400
02:12:41,870 --> 02:12:41,880
but I felt like you know it was that
 

7401
02:12:41,880 --> 02:12:43,609
but I felt like you know it was that
like a cool like point in history and

7402
02:12:43,609 --> 02:12:43,619
like a cool like point in history and
 

7403
02:12:43,619 --> 02:12:45,530
like a cool like point in history and
like I hope I was useful I probably kind

7404
02:12:45,530 --> 02:12:45,540
like I hope I was useful I probably kind
 

7405
02:12:45,540 --> 02:12:47,689
like I hope I was useful I probably kind
of wasn't but like maybe I mean you also

7406
02:12:47,689 --> 02:12:47,699
of wasn't but like maybe I mean you also
 

7407
02:12:47,699 --> 02:12:49,970
of wasn't but like maybe I mean you also
were one of the people that kind of made

7408
02:12:49,970 --> 02:12:49,980
were one of the people that kind of made
 

7409
02:12:49,980 --> 02:12:52,010
were one of the people that kind of made
a strong case to refactor yeah

7410
02:12:52,010 --> 02:12:52,020
a strong case to refactor yeah
 

7411
02:12:52,020 --> 02:12:53,870
a strong case to refactor yeah
and that that's a really

7412
02:12:53,870 --> 02:12:53,880
and that that's a really
 

7413
02:12:53,880 --> 02:12:56,510
and that that's a really
interesting thing to raise like maybe

7414
02:12:56,510 --> 02:12:56,520
interesting thing to raise like maybe
 

7415
02:12:56,520 --> 02:12:58,370
interesting thing to raise like maybe
that is the right you know

7416
02:12:58,370 --> 02:12:58,380
that is the right you know
 

7417
02:12:58,380 --> 02:12:59,870
that is the right you know
the timing of that is really interesting

7418
02:12:59,870 --> 02:12:59,880
the timing of that is really interesting
 

7419
02:12:59,880 --> 02:13:01,250
the timing of that is really interesting
if you look at just the development of

7420
02:13:01,250 --> 02:13:01,260
if you look at just the development of
 

7421
02:13:01,260 --> 02:13:04,189
if you look at just the development of
autopilot you know going um from

7422
02:13:04,189 --> 02:13:04,199
autopilot you know going um from
 

7423
02:13:04,199 --> 02:13:06,770
autopilot you know going um from
mobileye to just like more if you look

7424
02:13:06,770 --> 02:13:06,780
mobileye to just like more if you look
 

7425
02:13:06,780 --> 02:13:09,109
mobileye to just like more if you look
at the history of semiton was driving in

7426
02:13:09,109 --> 02:13:09,119
at the history of semiton was driving in
 

7427
02:13:09,119 --> 02:13:13,310
at the history of semiton was driving in
Tesla is is more and more like you could

7428
02:13:13,310 --> 02:13:13,320
Tesla is is more and more like you could
 

7429
02:13:13,320 --> 02:13:16,010
Tesla is is more and more like you could
say refactoring or or starting from

7430
02:13:16,010 --> 02:13:16,020
say refactoring or or starting from
 

7431
02:13:16,020 --> 02:13:18,050
say refactoring or or starting from
scratch redeveloping from scratch it's

7432
02:13:18,050 --> 02:13:18,060
scratch redeveloping from scratch it's
 

7433
02:13:18,060 --> 02:13:20,569
scratch redeveloping from scratch it's
refactoring all the way down and like

7434
02:13:20,569 --> 02:13:20,579
refactoring all the way down and like
 

7435
02:13:20,579 --> 02:13:22,609
refactoring all the way down and like
and the question is like can you do that

7436
02:13:22,609 --> 02:13:22,619
and the question is like can you do that
 

7437
02:13:22,619 --> 02:13:25,390
and the question is like can you do that
sooner uh can you maintain product

7438
02:13:25,390 --> 02:13:25,400
sooner uh can you maintain product
 

7439
02:13:25,400 --> 02:13:28,370
sooner uh can you maintain product
profitability and like what's the what's

02:13:28,370 --> 02:13:28,380
profitability and like what's the what's
 

7441
02:13:28,380 --> 02:13:29,990
profitability and like what's the what's
the right time to do it how do you do it

7442
02:13:29,990 --> 02:13:30,000
the right time to do it how do you do it
 

7443
02:13:30,000 --> 02:13:32,450
the right time to do it how do you do it
you know on any one day it's like you

7444
02:13:32,450 --> 02:13:32,460
you know on any one day it's like you
 

7445
02:13:32,460 --> 02:13:33,709
you know on any one day it's like you
don't want to pull off the Band-Aids

7446

little fix here and there but maybe

7452
02:13:39,470 --> 02:13:39,480
little fix here and there but maybe
 

7453
02:13:39,480 --> 02:13:41,689
little fix here and there but maybe

programming language just go that far I

7472
02:14:03,350 --> 02:14:03,360
programming language just go that far I
 

7473
02:14:03,360 --> 02:14:06,109
programming language just go that far I
mean the first thing that I would do is

7474
02:14:06,109 --> 02:14:06,119
mean the first thing that I would do is
 

7475
02:14:06,119 --> 02:14:08,330
mean the first thing that I would do is
build tests the first thing I would do

7476
02:14:08,330 --> 02:14:08,340
build tests the first thing I would do
 

7477
02:14:08,340 --> 02:14:12,169
build tests the first thing I would do
is get a CI to where people can trust to

7478
02:14:12,169 --> 02:14:12,179
is get a CI to where people can trust to
 

7479
02:14:12,179 --> 02:14:14,149
is get a CI to where people can trust to
make changes

7480
02:14:14,149 --> 02:14:14,159
make changes
 

7481
02:14:14,159 --> 02:14:16,970
make changes
so that if you can't touch any code I

7482
02:14:16,970 --> 02:14:16,980
so that if you can't touch any code I
 

7483
02:14:16,980 --> 02:14:18,470
so that if you can't touch any code I
would actually say no one touches any

7484
02:14:18,470 --> 02:14:18,480
would actually say no one touches any
 

7485
02:14:18,480 --> 02:14:20,030
would actually say no one touches any
code the first thing we do is we test

7486
02:14:20,030 --> 02:14:20,040
code the first thing we do is we test
 

7487
02:14:20,040 --> 02:14:21,470
code the first thing we do is we test
this code base and this is Classic this

7488
02:14:21,470 --> 02:14:21,480
this code base and this is Classic this
 

7489
02:14:21,480 --> 02:14:22,790
this code base and this is Classic this
is how you approach a legacy code base

7490
02:14:22,790 --> 02:14:22,800
is how you approach a legacy code base
 

7491
02:14:22,800 --> 02:14:24,830
is how you approach a legacy code base
this is like what any how to approach a

7492
02:14:24,830 --> 02:14:24,840
this is like what any how to approach a
 

7493
02:14:24,840 --> 02:14:26,930
this is like what any how to approach a
legacy code base book will tell you

7494
02:14:26,930 --> 02:14:26,940
legacy code base book will tell you
 

7495
02:14:26,940 --> 02:14:29,510
legacy code base book will tell you
so and then you hope that there's

7496
02:14:29,510 --> 02:14:29,520
so and then you hope that there's
 

7497
02:14:29,520 --> 02:14:33,530
so and then you hope that there's
modules that can live on for a while and

7498
02:14:33,530 --> 02:14:33,540
modules that can live on for a while and
 

7499
02:14:33,540 --> 02:14:35,390
modules that can live on for a while and
then you add new ones maybe in a

7500
02:14:35,390 --> 02:14:35,400
then you add new ones maybe in a
 

7501
02:14:35,400 --> 02:14:37,790
then you add new ones maybe in a
different language or before we design

7502
02:14:37,790 --> 02:14:37,800
different language or before we design
 

7503
02:14:37,800 --> 02:14:39,709
different language or before we design
it new ones we replace old ones yeah

7504
02:14:39,709 --> 02:14:39,719
it new ones we replace old ones yeah
 

7505
02:14:39,719 --> 02:14:41,450
it new ones we replace old ones yeah
yeah meaning like replace old ones with

7506
02:14:41,450 --> 02:14:41,460
yeah meaning like replace old ones with
 

7507
02:14:41,460 --> 02:14:43,790
yeah meaning like replace old ones with
something simpler we look at this like

7508
02:14:43,790 --> 02:14:43,800
something simpler we look at this like
 

7509
02:14:43,800 --> 02:14:45,169
something simpler we look at this like
this thing that's a hundred thousand

7510
02:14:45,169 --> 02:14:45,179
this thing that's a hundred thousand
 

7511
02:14:45,179 --> 02:14:46,790
this thing that's a hundred thousand
lines and we're like well okay maybe

7512
02:14:46,790 --> 02:14:46,800
lines and we're like well okay maybe
 

7513
02:14:46,800 --> 02:14:48,890
lines and we're like well okay maybe
this didn't even make sense in 2010 but

7514
02:14:48,890 --> 02:14:48,900
this didn't even make sense in 2010 but
 

7515
02:14:48,900 --> 02:14:50,209
this didn't even make sense in 2010 but
now we can replace this with an open

7516
02:14:50,209 --> 02:14:50,219
now we can replace this with an open
 

7517
02:14:50,219 --> 02:14:51,290
now we can replace this with an open
source thing

7518
02:14:51,290 --> 02:14:51,300
source thing
 

7519
02:14:51,300 --> 02:14:54,169
source thing
right yeah and you know we look at this

7520
02:14:54,169 --> 02:14:54,179
right yeah and you know we look at this
 

7521
02:14:54,179 --> 02:14:55,970
right yeah and you know we look at this
here here's another 50 000 lines well

7522
02:14:55,970 --> 02:14:55,980
here here's another 50 000 lines well
 

7523
02:14:55,980 --> 02:14:57,290
here here's another 50 000 lines well
actually you know we can replace this

7524
02:14:57,290 --> 02:14:57,300
actually you know we can replace this
 

7525
02:14:57,300 --> 02:14:59,990
actually you know we can replace this
with 300 lines ago and you know what I

7526
02:14:59,990 --> 02:15:00,000
with 300 lines ago and you know what I
 

7527
02:15:00,000 --> 02:15:02,030
with 300 lines ago and you know what I
trust that the go actually replaces this

7528
02:15:02,030 --> 02:15:02,040
trust that the go actually replaces this
 

7529
02:15:02,040 --> 02:15:03,530
trust that the go actually replaces this
thing because all the tests still pass

7530
02:15:03,530 --> 02:15:03,540
thing because all the tests still pass
 

7531
02:15:03,540 --> 02:15:05,629
thing because all the tests still pass
so Step One is testing yeah and then

7532
02:15:05,629 --> 02:15:05,639
so Step One is testing yeah and then
 

7533
02:15:05,639 --> 02:15:07,430
so Step One is testing yeah and then
step two is like the programming

7534
02:15:07,430 --> 02:15:07,440
step two is like the programming
 

7535
02:15:07,440 --> 02:15:09,350
step two is like the programming
language is an afterthought right you

7536
02:15:09,350 --> 02:15:09,360
language is an afterthought right you
 

7537
02:15:09,360 --> 02:15:10,550
language is an afterthought right you
know let a whole lot of people compete

7538
02:15:10,550 --> 02:15:10,560
know let a whole lot of people compete
 

7539
02:15:10,560 --> 02:15:11,930
know let a whole lot of people compete
be like Okay who wants to rewrite a

7540
02:15:11,930 --> 02:15:11,940
be like Okay who wants to rewrite a
 

7541
02:15:11,940 --> 02:15:13,069

module whatever language you want to

7542
02:15:13,069 --> 02:15:13,079
module whatever language you want to
 

7543
02:15:13,079 --> 02:15:14,810
module whatever language you want to
write it in just the tests have to pass

7544
02:15:14,810 --> 02:15:14,820
write it in just the tests have to pass
 

7545
02:15:14,820 --> 02:15:16,910
write it in just the tests have to pass
and if you figure out how to make the

7546
02:15:16,910 --> 02:15:16,920
and if you figure out how to make the
 

7547
02:15:16,920 --> 02:15:19,189
and if you figure out how to make the
test pass but break the site that's we

7548
02:15:19,189 --> 02:15:19,199
test pass but break the site that's we
 

7549
02:15:19,199 --> 02:15:20,930
test pass but break the site that's we
got to go back to Step One Step One is

7550
02:15:20,930 --> 02:15:20,940
got to go back to Step One Step One is
 

7551
02:15:20,940 --> 02:15:22,790
got to go back to Step One Step One is
get tests that you trust in order to

7552
02:15:22,790 --> 02:15:22,800
get tests that you trust in order to
 

7553
02:15:22,800 --> 02:15:24,169
get tests that you trust in order to
make changes in the code base I wonder

7554
02:15:24,169 --> 02:15:24,179
make changes in the code base I wonder
 

7555
02:15:24,179 --> 02:15:25,850
make changes in the code base I wonder
how hard it is too because I'm with you

7556
02:15:25,850 --> 02:15:25,860
how hard it is too because I'm with you
 

7557
02:15:25,860 --> 02:15:28,790
how hard it is too because I'm with you
on on testing on everything I have from

7558
02:15:28,790 --> 02:15:28,800
on on testing on everything I have from
 

7559
02:15:28,800 --> 02:15:30,410
on on testing on everything I have from
tests to like asserts to everything

7560
02:15:30,410 --> 02:15:30,420
tests to like asserts to everything
 

7561
02:15:30,420 --> 02:15:33,589
tests to like asserts to everything
which code is just covered in this

7562
02:15:33,589 --> 02:15:33,599
which code is just covered in this
 

7563
02:15:33,599 --> 02:15:37,490
which code is just covered in this
because uh it should be very easy to

7564
02:15:37,490 --> 02:15:37,500
because uh it should be very easy to
 

7565
02:15:37,500 --> 02:15:39,830
because uh it should be very easy to
make rapid changes

7566
02:15:39,830 --> 02:15:39,840
make rapid changes
 

7567
02:15:39,840 --> 02:15:41,750
make rapid changes
and no that's not going to break

7568
02:15:41,750 --> 02:15:41,760
and no that's not going to break
 

7569
02:15:41,760 --> 02:15:43,669
and no that's not going to break
everything and that's the way to do it

7570
02:15:43,669 --> 02:15:43,679
everything and that's the way to do it
 

7571
02:15:43,679 --> 02:15:46,790
everything and that's the way to do it
but I wonder how difficult is it to

7572
02:15:46,790 --> 02:15:46,800
but I wonder how difficult is it to
 

7573
02:15:46,800 --> 02:15:49,310
but I wonder how difficult is it to
um integrate tests into a code base that

7574
02:15:49,310 --> 02:15:49,320
um integrate tests into a code base that
 

7575
02:15:49,320 --> 02:15:50,990
um integrate tests into a code base that
doesn't have many of them so I'll tell

7576
02:15:50,990 --> 02:15:51,000
doesn't have many of them so I'll tell
 

7577
02:15:51,000 --> 02:15:52,189
doesn't have many of them so I'll tell
you what my plan was at Twitter it's

7578
02:15:52,189 --> 02:15:52,199
you what my plan was at Twitter it's
 

7579
02:15:52,199 --> 02:15:53,450
you what my plan was at Twitter it's
actually similar to something we use at

7580
02:15:53,450 --> 02:15:53,460
actually similar to something we use at
 

7581
02:15:53,460 --> 02:15:54,470
actually similar to something we use at
comma so a common we have this thing

7582
02:15:54,470 --> 02:15:54,480
comma so a common we have this thing
 

7583
02:15:54,480 --> 02:15:56,689
comma so a common we have this thing
called process replay and we have a

7584
02:15:56,689 --> 02:15:56,699
called process replay and we have a
 

7585
02:15:56,699 --> 02:15:57,950
called process replay and we have a
bunch of routes that'll be run through

7586
02:15:57,950 --> 02:15:57,960
bunch of routes that'll be run through
 

7587
02:15:57,960 --> 02:15:59,390
bunch of routes that'll be run through
so comma is a microservice architecture

7588
02:15:59,390 --> 02:15:59,400
so comma is a microservice architecture
 

7589
02:15:59,400 --> 02:16:01,609
so comma is a microservice architecture
too with microservices in the driving

7590
02:16:01,609 --> 02:16:01,619
too with microservices in the driving
 

7591
02:16:01,619 --> 02:16:03,410
too with microservices in the driving
like we have one for the cameras one for

7592
02:16:03,410 --> 02:16:03,420
like we have one for the cameras one for
 

7593
02:16:03,420 --> 02:16:06,109
like we have one for the cameras one for
the sensor one for the planner uh one

7594
02:16:06,109 --> 02:16:06,119
the sensor one for the planner uh one
 

7595
02:16:06,119 --> 02:16:07,490
the sensor one for the planner uh one
for the model

7596
02:16:07,490 --> 02:16:07,500
for the model
 

7597
02:16:07,500 --> 02:16:09,830
for the model
and we have an API which the

7598
02:16:09,830 --> 02:16:09,840
and we have an API which the
 

7599
02:16:09,840 --> 02:16:11,270
and we have an API which the
microservices has talked to each other

7600
02:16:11,270 --> 02:16:11,280
microservices has talked to each other
 

7601
02:16:11,280 --> 02:16:12,770
microservices has talked to each other
with we use this custom thing called

7602
02:16:12,770 --> 02:16:12,780
with we use this custom thing called
 

7603
02:16:12,780 --> 02:16:16,669
with we use this custom thing called
serial which uses zmq Twitter uses um

7604
02:16:16,669 --> 02:16:16,679
serial which uses zmq Twitter uses um
 

7605
02:16:16,679 --> 02:16:17,810
serial which uses zmq Twitter uses um
Thrift

7606
02:16:17,810 --> 02:16:17,820
Thrift
 

7607
02:16:17,820 --> 02:16:19,970
Thrift
and then it uses this thing called

7608
02:16:19,970 --> 02:16:19,980
and then it uses this thing called
 

7609
02:16:19,980 --> 02:16:23,209
and then it uses this thing called
finagle which is a Scala uh

7610
02:16:23,209 --> 02:16:23,219
finagle which is a Scala uh
 

7611
02:16:23,219 --> 02:16:24,950
finagle which is a Scala uh
uh RPC backend but this doesn't even

7612
02:16:24,950 --> 02:16:24,960
uh RPC backend but this doesn't even
 

7613
02:16:24,960 --> 02:16:27,250
uh RPC backend but this doesn't even
really matter the thrift and finagle

7614
02:16:27,250 --> 02:16:27,260
really matter the thrift and finagle
 

7615
02:16:27,260 --> 02:16:30,770
really matter the thrift and finagle
layer was a great place I thought to

7616
02:16:30,770 --> 02:16:30,780
layer was a great place I thought to
 

7617
02:16:30,780 --> 02:16:32,690
layer was a great place I thought to
write tests right to start building

7618
02:16:32,690 --> 02:16:32,700
write tests right to start building
 

7619
02:16:32,700 --> 02:16:34,129
write tests right to start building
something that looks like process replay

7620
02:16:34,129 --> 02:16:34,139
something that looks like process replay
 

7621
02:16:34,139 --> 02:16:36,530
something that looks like process replay
so Twitter had some stuff that looked

7622
02:16:36,530 --> 02:16:36,540
so Twitter had some stuff that looked
 

7623
02:16:36,540 --> 02:16:39,049
so Twitter had some stuff that looked
kind of like this but it wasn't offline

7624
02:16:39,049 --> 02:16:39,059
kind of like this but it wasn't offline
 

7625
02:16:39,059 --> 02:16:41,209
kind of like this but it wasn't offline
it was only online so you could ship

7626
02:16:41,209 --> 02:16:41,219
it was only online so you could ship
 

7627
02:16:41,219 --> 02:16:43,849
it was only online so you could ship
like a modified version of it and then

7628
02:16:43,849 --> 02:16:43,859
like a modified version of it and then
 

7629
02:16:43,859 --> 02:16:46,310
like a modified version of it and then
you could redirect some of the traffic

7630
02:16:46,310 --> 02:16:46,320
you could redirect some of the traffic
 

7631
02:16:46,320 --> 02:16:47,870
you could redirect some of the traffic
to your modified version and diff those

7632
02:16:47,870 --> 02:16:47,880
to your modified version and diff those
 

7633
02:16:47,880 --> 02:16:50,089
to your modified version and diff those
two but it was all online but there was

7634
02:16:50,089 --> 02:16:50,099
two but it was all online but there was
 

7635
02:16:50,099 --> 02:16:52,190
two but it was all online but there was
no like Ci in the traditional sense I

7636
02:16:52,190 --> 02:16:52,200
no like Ci in the traditional sense I
 

7637
02:16:52,200 --> 02:16:53,389
no like Ci in the traditional sense I
mean there was some but like it was not

7638
02:16:53,389 --> 02:16:53,399
mean there was some but like it was not
 

7639
02:16:53,399 --> 02:16:55,310
mean there was some but like it was not
full coverage so you can't run all of

7640
02:16:55,310 --> 02:16:55,320
full coverage so you can't run all of
 

7641
02:16:55,320 --> 02:16:57,469
full coverage so you can't run all of
Twitter offline to test something well

7642
02:16:57,469 --> 02:16:57,479
Twitter offline to test something well
 

7643
02:16:57,479 --> 02:16:58,849
Twitter offline to test something well
then this was another problem you can't

7644
02:16:58,849 --> 02:16:58,859
then this was another problem you can't
 

7645
02:16:58,859 --> 02:17:00,169
then this was another problem you can't
run all of Twitter

7646
02:17:00,169 --> 02:17:00,179
run all of Twitter
 

7647
02:17:00,179 --> 02:17:02,929
run all of Twitter
right period Twitter any one person

7648
02:17:02,929 --> 02:17:02,939
right period Twitter any one person
 

7649
02:17:02,939 --> 02:17:04,490
right period Twitter any one person
camera Twitter runs in three data

7650
02:17:04,490 --> 02:17:04,500
camera Twitter runs in three data
 

7651
02:17:04,500 --> 02:17:06,169
camera Twitter runs in three data
centers and that's it yeah there's no

7652
02:17:06,169 --> 02:17:06,179
centers and that's it yeah there's no
 

7653
02:17:06,179 --> 02:17:08,330
centers and that's it yeah there's no
other place you can run Twitter which is

7654
02:17:08,330 --> 02:17:08,340
other place you can run Twitter which is
 

7655
02:17:08,340 --> 02:17:09,169
other place you can run Twitter which is
like

7656
02:17:09,169 --> 02:17:09,179
like
 

7657
02:17:09,179 --> 02:17:10,790
like
George you don't understand this is

7658
02:17:10,790 --> 02:17:10,800
George you don't understand this is
 

7659
02:17:10,800 --> 02:17:12,530
George you don't understand this is
modern software development no this is

7660
02:17:12,530 --> 02:17:12,540
modern software development no this is
 

7661
02:17:12,540 --> 02:17:14,629
modern software development no this is
[\h__\h] like why can't it run on my

7662
02:17:14,629 --> 02:17:14,639
[\h__\h] like why can't it run on my
 

7663
02:17:14,639 --> 02:17:17,150
[\h__\h] like why can't it run on my
laptop

7664
02:17:17,150 --> 02:17:17,160

 

7665
02:17:17,160 --> 02:17:18,950

yeah okay well I'm not saying you're

7666
02:17:18,950 --> 02:17:18,960
yeah okay well I'm not saying you're
 

7667
02:17:18,960 --> 02:17:20,330
yeah okay well I'm not saying you're
gonna download the whole database to

7668
02:17:20,330 --> 02:17:20,340
gonna download the whole database to
 

7669
02:17:20,340 --> 02:17:21,650
gonna download the whole database to
your laptop but I'm saying all the

7670
02:17:21,650 --> 02:17:21,660
your laptop but I'm saying all the
 

7671
02:17:21,660 --> 02:17:23,030
your laptop but I'm saying all the
middleware and the front end should run

7672
02:17:23,030 --> 02:17:23,040
middleware and the front end should run
 

7673
02:17:23,040 --> 02:17:25,490
middleware and the front end should run
on my laptop right that sounds really

7674
02:17:25,490 --> 02:17:25,500
on my laptop right that sounds really
 

7675
02:17:25,500 --> 02:17:27,110
on my laptop right that sounds really
compelling yeah

7676
02:17:27,110 --> 02:17:27,120
compelling yeah
 

7677
02:17:27,120 --> 02:17:30,650
compelling yeah
yeah but can that be achieved by a code

7678
02:17:30,650 --> 02:17:30,660
yeah but can that be achieved by a code
 

7679
02:17:30,660 --> 02:17:33,410
yeah but can that be achieved by a code
base that grows over the years I mean

7680
02:17:33,410 --> 02:17:33,420
base that grows over the years I mean
 

7681
02:17:33,420 --> 02:17:34,790
base that grows over the years I mean
the three data centers didn't have to be

7682
02:17:34,790 --> 02:17:34,800
the three data centers didn't have to be
 

7683
02:17:34,800 --> 02:17:36,290
the three data centers didn't have to be
right because if they're totally

7684
02:17:36,290 --> 02:17:36,300
right because if they're totally
 

7685
02:17:36,300 --> 02:17:38,270
right because if they're totally
different like designs the problem is

7686
02:17:38,270 --> 02:17:38,280
different like designs the problem is
 

7687
02:17:38,280 --> 02:17:40,790
different like designs the problem is
more like like why did the code base

7688
02:17:40,790 --> 02:17:40,800
more like like why did the code base
 

7689
02:17:40,800 --> 02:17:42,950
more like like why did the code base
have to grow what new functionality has

7690
02:17:42,950 --> 02:17:42,960
have to grow what new functionality has
 

7691
02:17:42,960 --> 02:17:45,349
have to grow what new functionality has
been added to compensate for the the

7692
02:17:45,349 --> 02:17:45,359
been added to compensate for the the
 

7693
02:17:45,359 --> 02:17:47,570
been added to compensate for the the
lines of code that are there

7694
02:17:47,570 --> 02:17:47,580
lines of code that are there
 

7695
02:17:47,580 --> 02:17:50,089
lines of code that are there
one of the ways to explain is that the

7696
02:17:50,089 --> 02:17:50,099
one of the ways to explain is that the
 

7697
02:17:50,099 --> 02:17:51,589
one of the ways to explain is that the
incentive for software developers to

7698
02:17:51,589 --> 02:17:51,599
incentive for software developers to
 

7699
02:17:51,599 --> 02:17:54,049
incentive for software developers to
move up in the companies to add code

7700
02:17:54,049 --> 02:17:54,059
move up in the companies to add code
 

7701
02:17:54,059 --> 02:17:56,450
move up in the companies to add code
to add especially you know what the

7702
02:17:56,450 --> 02:17:56,460
to add especially you know what the
 

7703
02:17:56,460 --> 02:17:57,950
to add especially you know what the
incentive for politicians to move up in

7704
02:17:57,950 --> 02:17:57,960
incentive for politicians to move up in
 

7705
02:17:57,960 --> 02:17:59,389
incentive for politicians to move up in
the political structures to add laws

7706
02:17:59,389 --> 02:17:59,399
the political structures to add laws
 

7707

yeah same problem yeah
 

7709
02:18:02,639 --> 02:18:05,929
yeah same problem yeah
yeah if uh the flip side is to simplify

7710
02:18:05,929 --> 02:18:05,939
yeah if uh the flip side is to simplify
 

7711
02:18:05,939 --> 02:18:08,509
yeah if uh the flip side is to simplify
simplify simplify I mean you know what

7712

02:18:10,070 --> 02:18:10,080
this is something that I do differently
 

7715
02:18:10,080 --> 02:18:12,110
this is something that I do differently
from from from Elon with with comma

about self-driving cars
 

7719
02:18:14,280 --> 02:18:16,129
about self-driving cars
but you know I hear the new version is

7720
02:18:16,129 --> 02:18:16,139
but you know I hear the new version is
 

7721
02:18:16,139 --> 02:18:17,629
but you know I hear the new version is
going to come out and the new version is

7722
02:18:17,629 --> 02:18:17,639
going to come out and the new version is
 

7723
02:18:17,639 --> 02:18:20,330
going to come out and the new version is
not going to be better but at first and

7724
02:18:20,330 --> 02:18:20,340
not going to be better but at first and
 

7725
02:18:20,340 --> 02:18:21,770
not going to be better but at first and
it's going to require a ton of refactors

7726
02:18:21,770 --> 02:18:21,780
it's going to require a ton of refactors
 

7727
02:18:21,780 --> 02:18:24,709
it's going to require a ton of refactors
and I say okay take as long as you need

7728
02:18:24,709 --> 02:18:24,719
and I say okay take as long as you need
 

7729
02:18:24,719 --> 02:18:26,750
and I say okay take as long as you need
like you convince me this architecture

7730
02:18:26,750 --> 02:18:26,760
like you convince me this architecture
 

7731
02:18:26,760 --> 02:18:28,669
like you convince me this architecture
is better okay we have to move to it

7732
02:18:28,669 --> 02:18:28,679
is better okay we have to move to it
 

7733
02:18:28,679 --> 02:18:30,110
is better okay we have to move to it
even if it's not going to make the

7734
02:18:30,110 --> 02:18:30,120
even if it's not going to make the
 

7735
02:18:30,120 --> 02:18:32,389
even if it's not going to make the
product better tomorrow the top priority

7736
02:18:32,389 --> 02:18:32,399
product better tomorrow the top priority
 

7737
02:18:32,399 --> 02:18:33,889
product better tomorrow the top priority
is making is getting the architecture

7738
02:18:33,889 --> 02:18:33,899
is making is getting the architecture
 

7739
02:18:33,899 --> 02:18:36,230
is making is getting the architecture
right so what do you think about sort of

7740
02:18:36,230 --> 02:18:36,240
right so what do you think about sort of
 

7741
02:18:36,240 --> 02:18:40,370
right so what do you think about sort of
a thing where the product is online

7742
02:18:40,370 --> 02:18:40,380
a thing where the product is online
 

7743
02:18:40,380 --> 02:18:43,190
a thing where the product is online
so how I guess would you do a refactor

7744
02:18:43,190 --> 02:18:43,200
so how I guess would you do a refactor
 

7745
02:18:43,200 --> 02:18:45,709
so how I guess would you do a refactor
if you ran engineering Twitter would you

7746
02:18:45,709 --> 02:18:45,719
if you ran engineering Twitter would you
 

7747
02:18:45,719 --> 02:18:47,629
if you ran engineering Twitter would you
just do a refactor how long would it

7748
02:18:47,629 --> 02:18:47,639
just do a refactor how long would it
 

7749
02:18:47,639 --> 02:18:49,070
just do a refactor how long would it
take what would that mean for the

7750
02:18:49,070 --> 02:18:49,080
take what would that mean for the
 

7751
02:18:49,080 --> 02:18:51,950
take what would that mean for the
running of the of the actual service you

7752
02:18:51,950 --> 02:18:51,960
running of the of the actual service you
 

7753
02:18:51,960 --> 02:18:55,129
running of the of the actual service you
know and

7754
02:18:55,129 --> 02:18:55,139

 

7755
02:18:55,139 --> 02:18:57,950

I'm not the right person to run Twitter

7756
02:18:57,950 --> 02:18:57,960
I'm not the right person to run Twitter
 

7757
02:18:57,960 --> 02:19:00,110
I'm not the right person to run Twitter
I'm just not and that's the problem like

7758
02:19:00,110 --> 02:19:00,120
I'm just not and that's the problem like
 

7759
02:19:00,120 --> 02:19:02,030
I'm just not and that's the problem like
like I don't really know I don't really

7760
02:19:02,030 --> 02:19:02,040
like I don't really know I don't really
 

7761
02:19:02,040 --> 02:19:04,370
like I don't really know I don't really
know if that's you know a common thing

7762
02:19:04,370 --> 02:19:04,380
know if that's you know a common thing
 

7763
02:19:04,380 --> 02:19:05,810
know if that's you know a common thing
that I thought a lot while I was there

7764
02:19:05,810 --> 02:19:05,820
that I thought a lot while I was there
 

7765
02:19:05,820 --> 02:19:07,310
that I thought a lot while I was there
was whenever I thought something that

7766
02:19:07,310 --> 02:19:07,320
was whenever I thought something that
 

7767
02:19:07,320 --> 02:19:09,169
was whenever I thought something that
was different to what Elon thought

7768
02:19:09,169 --> 02:19:09,179
was different to what Elon thought
 

7769
02:19:09,179 --> 02:19:10,610
was different to what Elon thought
I'd have to run something in the back of

7770
02:19:10,610 --> 02:19:10,620
I'd have to run something in the back of
 

7771
02:19:10,620 --> 02:19:12,230
I'd have to run something in the back of
my head reminding myself

7772
02:19:12,230 --> 02:19:12,240
my head reminding myself
 

7773
02:19:12,240 --> 02:19:14,750
my head reminding myself
that Elon is the richest man in the

7774
02:19:14,750 --> 02:19:14,760
that Elon is the richest man in the
 

7775
02:19:14,760 --> 02:19:15,770
that Elon is the richest man in the
world

7776
02:19:15,770 --> 02:19:15,780
world
 

7777
02:19:15,780 --> 02:19:18,589
world
and in general his ideas are better than

7778
02:19:18,589 --> 02:19:18,599
and in general his ideas are better than
 

7779
02:19:18,599 --> 02:19:21,410
and in general his ideas are better than
mine now there's a few things I think I

7780
02:19:21,410 --> 02:19:21,420
mine now there's a few things I think I
 

7781
02:19:21,420 --> 02:19:24,469
mine now there's a few things I think I
do understand and know more about

7782
02:19:24,469 --> 02:19:24,479
do understand and know more about
 

7783
02:19:24,479 --> 02:19:26,690
do understand and know more about
but like in general

7784
02:19:26,690 --> 02:19:26,700
but like in general
 

7785
02:19:26,700 --> 02:19:29,150
but like in general
I'm not qualified to run Twitter as soon

7786
02:19:29,150 --> 02:19:29,160
I'm not qualified to run Twitter as soon
 

7787
02:19:29,160 --> 02:19:30,530
I'm not qualified to run Twitter as soon
as I qualified but like I don't think

7788
02:19:30,530 --> 02:19:30,540
as I qualified but like I don't think
 

7789
02:19:30,540 --> 02:19:31,790
as I qualified but like I don't think
I'd be that good at it I don't think I'd

7790
02:19:31,790 --> 02:19:31,800
I'd be that good at it I don't think I'd
 

7791
02:19:31,800 --> 02:19:33,530
I'd be that good at it I don't think I'd
be good at it I don't think I'd really

7792
02:19:33,530 --> 02:19:33,540
be good at it I don't think I'd really
 

7793
02:19:33,540 --> 02:19:35,089
be good at it I don't think I'd really
be good at running an engineering

7794
02:19:35,089 --> 02:19:35,099
be good at running an engineering
 

7795
02:19:35,099 --> 02:19:37,490
be good at running an engineering
organization at scale

7796
02:19:37,490 --> 02:19:37,500
organization at scale
 

7797
02:19:37,500 --> 02:19:40,669
organization at scale
I think I could lead a very good

7798
02:19:40,669 --> 02:19:40,679
I think I could lead a very good
 

7799
02:19:40,679 --> 02:19:43,310
I think I could lead a very good
refactor of Twitter and it would take

7800
02:19:43,310 --> 02:19:43,320
refactor of Twitter and it would take
 

7801
02:19:43,320 --> 02:19:46,190
refactor of Twitter and it would take
like six months to a year and the

7802
02:19:46,190 --> 02:19:46,200
like six months to a year and the
 

7803
02:19:46,200 --> 02:19:47,990
like six months to a year and the
results to show at the end of it would

7804
02:19:47,990 --> 02:19:48,000
results to show at the end of it would
 

7805
02:19:48,000 --> 02:19:50,090
results to show at the end of it would
be feature development in general it

7806
02:19:50,090 --> 02:19:50,100
be feature development in general it
 

7807
02:19:50,100 --> 02:19:53,030
be feature development in general it
takes 10x less time 10x less man hours

7808
02:19:53,030 --> 02:19:53,040
takes 10x less time 10x less man hours
 

7809
02:19:53,040 --> 02:19:55,550
takes 10x less time 10x less man hours
that's what I think I could actually do

7810
02:19:55,550 --> 02:19:55,560
that's what I think I could actually do
 

7811
02:19:55,560 --> 02:19:56,690
that's what I think I could actually do
um do I think that it's the right

7812
02:19:56,690 --> 02:19:56,700
um do I think that it's the right
 

7813
02:19:56,700 --> 02:19:58,910
um do I think that it's the right
decision for the business above my pay

7814
02:19:58,910 --> 02:19:58,920
decision for the business above my pay
 

7815

7817
02:20:02,640 --> 02:20:04,670

yeah but a lot of these kinds of

7818
02:20:04,670 --> 02:20:04,680
yeah but a lot of these kinds of
 

7819
02:20:04,680 --> 02:20:06,110
yeah but a lot of these kinds of
decisions are above everybody's pay

7820
02:20:06,110 --> 02:20:06,120
decisions are above everybody's pay
 

7821
02:20:06,120 --> 02:20:07,610

don't want to do that I just like like

7824
02:20:08,810 --> 02:20:08,820
don't want to do that I just like like
 

7825
02:20:08,820 --> 02:20:11,389
don't want to do that I just like like
if you really forced me to yeah it would

7826
02:20:11,389 --> 02:20:11,399
if you really forced me to yeah it would
 

7827
02:20:11,399 --> 02:20:14,570
if you really forced me to yeah it would
make me maybe

7828
02:20:14,570 --> 02:20:14,580

 

7829
02:20:14,580 --> 02:20:16,190

make me upset

7830
02:20:16,190 --> 02:20:16,200
make me upset
 

7831
02:20:16,200 --> 02:20:19,070
make me upset
if I had to make those decisions

7832
02:20:19,070 --> 02:20:19,080
if I had to make those decisions
 

7833
02:20:19,080 --> 02:20:23,750
if I had to make those decisions
yeah but a refactor is so compelling if

7834
02:20:23,750 --> 02:20:23,760
yeah but a refactor is so compelling if
 

7835
02:20:23,760 --> 02:20:26,210
yeah but a refactor is so compelling if
this is to become something much bigger

7836
02:20:26,210 --> 02:20:26,220
this is to become something much bigger
 

7837
02:20:26,220 --> 02:20:28,310
this is to become something much bigger
than what Twitter was

7838
02:20:28,310 --> 02:20:28,320
than what Twitter was
 

7839
02:20:28,320 --> 02:20:31,730
than what Twitter was
is it feels like a refactor has to be

7840
02:20:31,730 --> 02:20:31,740
is it feels like a refactor has to be
 

7841
02:20:31,740 --> 02:20:33,590
is it feels like a refactor has to be
coming at some point George or Junior

okay like that's like your opinion man

7850
02:20:41,929 --> 02:20:41,939
okay like that's like your opinion man
 

7851
02:20:41,939 --> 02:20:43,969

right it's definitely not a question of
 

7861
02:20:50,040 --> 02:20:51,410
right it's definitely not a question of
engineering prowess it is a question of

7862
02:20:51,410 --> 02:20:51,420
engineering prowess it is a question of
 

7863
02:20:51,420 --> 02:20:52,610
engineering prowess it is a question of
maybe what the priorities are for the

7864
02:20:52,610 --> 02:20:52,620
maybe what the priorities are for the
 

7865
02:20:52,620 --> 02:20:55,309
maybe what the priorities are for the
company and I did get more intelligent

7866
02:20:55,309 --> 02:20:55,319
company and I did get more intelligent
 

7867
02:20:55,319 --> 02:20:57,349
company and I did get more intelligent
like feedback from people I think in

7868
02:20:57,349 --> 02:20:57,359
like feedback from people I think in
 

7869
02:20:57,359 --> 02:20:59,750
like feedback from people I think in
good faith like saying that

7870
02:20:59,750 --> 02:20:59,760
good faith like saying that
 

7871
02:20:59,760 --> 02:21:01,790
good faith like saying that
um from actually from Milan and like you

7872
02:21:01,790 --> 02:21:01,800
um from actually from Milan and like you
 

7873
02:21:01,800 --> 02:21:03,530
um from actually from Milan and like you
know from from Milan sort of like like

7874
02:21:03,530 --> 02:21:03,540
know from from Milan sort of like like
 

7875
02:21:03,540 --> 02:21:05,450
know from from Milan sort of like like
people were like well you know I stop

7876
02:21:05,450 --> 02:21:05,460
people were like well you know I stop
 

7877
02:21:05,460 --> 02:21:07,610
people were like well you know I stop
the world refactor might be great for

7878
02:21:07,610 --> 02:21:07,620
the world refactor might be great for
 

7879
02:21:07,620 --> 02:21:08,809
the world refactor might be great for
engineering but you don't even business

7880
02:21:08,809 --> 02:21:08,819
engineering but you don't even business
 

7881
02:21:08,819 --> 02:21:09,770
engineering but you don't even business
to run

7882
02:21:09,770 --> 02:21:09,780
to run
 

7883
02:21:09,780 --> 02:21:13,550
to run
and hey above my pay grade uh what'd you

7884
02:21:13,550 --> 02:21:13,560
and hey above my pay grade uh what'd you
 

7885
02:21:13,560 --> 02:21:15,110
and hey above my pay grade uh what'd you
think about Elon as an engineering

7886
02:21:15,110 --> 02:21:15,120
think about Elon as an engineering
 

7887
02:21:15,120 --> 02:21:18,170
think about Elon as an engineering
leader having to experience them in the

7888
02:21:18,170 --> 02:21:18,180
leader having to experience them in the
 

7889
02:21:18,180 --> 02:21:24,910
leader having to experience them in the
most chaotic of spaces I would say

7890
02:21:24,910 --> 02:21:24,920

 

7891
02:21:24,920 --> 02:21:28,130

my respect for Amazon changed

7892
02:21:28,130 --> 02:21:28,140
my respect for Amazon changed
 

7893
02:21:28,140 --> 02:21:30,349
my respect for Amazon changed
um and I did have to think a lot more

7894
02:21:30,349 --> 02:21:30,359
um and I did have to think a lot more
 

7895
02:21:30,359 --> 02:21:31,670
um and I did have to think a lot more
deeply about some of the decisions he's

7896
02:21:31,670 --> 02:21:31,680
deeply about some of the decisions he's
 

7897
02:21:31,680 --> 02:21:33,650
deeply about some of the decisions he's
forced to make

7898
02:21:33,650 --> 02:21:33,660
forced to make
 

7899
02:21:33,660 --> 02:21:36,050
forced to make
about the tensions within those the

7900
02:21:36,050 --> 02:21:36,060
about the tensions within those the
 

7901
02:21:36,060 --> 02:21:38,929
about the tensions within those the
trade-offs within those decisions

7902
02:21:38,929 --> 02:21:38,939
trade-offs within those decisions
 

7903
02:21:38,939 --> 02:21:41,990
trade-offs within those decisions
I felt like a whole like

7904
02:21:41,990 --> 02:21:42,000
I felt like a whole like
 

7905
02:21:42,000 --> 02:21:44,570
I felt like a whole like
like Matrix coming at him I think that's

7906
02:21:44,570 --> 02:21:44,580
like Matrix coming at him I think that's
 

7907
02:21:44,580 --> 02:21:46,010
like Matrix coming at him I think that's
Andrew Tate's word for it sorry to

7908
02:21:46,010 --> 02:21:46,020
Andrew Tate's word for it sorry to
 

7909
02:21:46,020 --> 02:21:48,170
Andrew Tate's word for it sorry to
borrow it also bigger than engineering

7910
02:21:48,170 --> 02:21:48,180
borrow it also bigger than engineering
 

7911
02:21:48,180 --> 02:21:51,770
borrow it also bigger than engineering
just everything yeah like like the war

7912
02:21:51,770 --> 02:21:51,780
just everything yeah like like the war
 

7913
02:21:51,780 --> 02:21:53,690
just everything yeah like like the war
on the woke

7914
02:21:53,690 --> 02:21:53,700
on the woke
 

7915
02:21:53,700 --> 02:21:56,809
on the woke
yeah like it just it just

7916
02:21:56,809 --> 02:21:56,819
yeah like it just it just
 

7917
02:21:56,819 --> 02:21:58,910
yeah like it just it just
man and like

7918
02:21:58,910 --> 02:21:58,920
man and like
 

7919
02:21:58,920 --> 02:22:01,309
man and like
he doesn't have to do this you know he

7920
02:22:01,309 --> 02:22:01,319
he doesn't have to do this you know he
 

7921
02:22:01,319 --> 02:22:04,010
he doesn't have to do this you know he
doesn't have to he could go like parag

7922
02:22:04,010 --> 02:22:04,020
doesn't have to he could go like parag
 

7923
02:22:04,020 --> 02:22:06,530
doesn't have to he could go like parag
and go chill at the four seasons of Maui

7924
02:22:06,530 --> 02:22:06,540
and go chill at the four seasons of Maui
 

7925
02:22:06,540 --> 02:22:09,170
and go chill at the four seasons of Maui
you know but see one person I respect

7926
02:22:09,170 --> 02:22:09,180
you know but see one person I respect
 

7927
02:22:09,180 --> 02:22:10,969
you know but see one person I respect
and one person I don't

7928
02:22:10,969 --> 02:22:10,979
and one person I don't
 

7929
02:22:10,979 --> 02:22:12,770
and one person I don't
so his heart is in the right place

7930
02:22:12,770 --> 02:22:12,780
so his heart is in the right place
 

7931
02:22:12,780 --> 02:22:15,469
so his heart is in the right place
fighting in this case for this ideal of

7932
02:22:15,469 --> 02:22:15,479
fighting in this case for this ideal of
 

7933
02:22:15,479 --> 02:22:17,450
fighting in this case for this ideal of
the freedom of expression

7934
02:22:17,450 --> 02:22:17,460
the freedom of expression
 

7935
02:22:17,460 --> 02:22:20,270
the freedom of expression
I wouldn't Define the ideal so simply I

7936
02:22:20,270 --> 02:22:20,280
I wouldn't Define the ideal so simply I
 

7937
02:22:20,280 --> 02:22:22,550
I wouldn't Define the ideal so simply I
think you can Define the ideal no more

7938
02:22:22,550 --> 02:22:22,560
think you can Define the ideal no more
 

7939
02:22:22,560 --> 02:22:25,670
think you can Define the ideal no more
than just saying elon's idea of a good

7940
02:22:25,670 --> 02:22:25,680
than just saying elon's idea of a good
 

7941
02:22:25,680 --> 02:22:26,630
than just saying elon's idea of a good
world

7942
02:22:26,630 --> 02:22:26,640
world
 

7943
02:22:26,640 --> 02:22:28,790
world
freedom of expression is

7944
02:22:28,790 --> 02:22:28,800
freedom of expression is
 

7945
02:22:28,800 --> 02:22:31,550
freedom of expression is
but to you it's still the downsides of

7946
02:22:31,550 --> 02:22:31,560
but to you it's still the downsides of
 

7947
02:22:31,560 --> 02:22:33,349
but to you it's still the downsides of
that is the monarchy

7948
02:22:33,349 --> 02:22:33,359
that is the monarchy
 

7949
02:22:33,359 --> 02:22:36,830
that is the monarchy
yeah I mean monarchy has problems right

7950
02:22:36,830 --> 02:22:36,840
yeah I mean monarchy has problems right
 

7951
02:22:36,840 --> 02:22:39,950
yeah I mean monarchy has problems right
but I mean would I trade right now the

7952
02:22:39,950 --> 02:22:39,960
but I mean would I trade right now the
 

7953
02:22:39,960 --> 02:22:42,110
but I mean would I trade right now the
Monarch or the current oligarchy which

7954
02:22:42,110 --> 02:22:42,120
Monarch or the current oligarchy which
 

7955
02:22:42,120 --> 02:22:43,969
Monarch or the current oligarchy which
runs America for the monarchy yeah I

7956
02:22:43,969 --> 02:22:43,979
runs America for the monarchy yeah I
 

7957
02:22:43,979 --> 02:22:45,770
runs America for the monarchy yeah I
would sure

7958
02:22:45,770 --> 02:22:45,780
would sure
 

7959
02:22:45,780 --> 02:22:47,450
would sure
for the Elon monarchy yeah you know why

7960
02:22:47,450 --> 02:22:47,460
for the Elon monarchy yeah you know why
 

7961
02:22:47,460 --> 02:22:48,950
for the Elon monarchy yeah you know why
because power would cost one cent a

7962
02:22:48,950 --> 02:22:48,960
because power would cost one cent a
 

7963
02:22:48,960 --> 02:22:50,270
because power would cost one cent a
kilowatt hour

7964
02:22:50,270 --> 02:22:50,280
kilowatt hour
 

7965
02:22:50,280 --> 02:22:52,969
kilowatt hour
tenth of a cent a kilowatt hour

7966
02:22:52,969 --> 02:22:52,979
tenth of a cent a kilowatt hour
 

7967
02:22:52,979 --> 02:22:55,490
tenth of a cent a kilowatt hour
what do you mean right now I pay about

7968
02:22:55,490 --> 02:22:55,500
what do you mean right now I pay about
 

7969
02:22:55,500 --> 02:22:57,349
what do you mean right now I pay about
20 cents a kilowatt hour for electricity

7970
02:22:57,349 --> 02:22:57,359
20 cents a kilowatt hour for electricity
 

7971
02:22:57,359 --> 02:22:59,450
20 cents a kilowatt hour for electricity
in San Diego that's like the same price

7972
02:22:59,450 --> 02:22:59,460
in San Diego that's like the same price
 

7973
02:22:59,460 --> 02:23:01,610
in San Diego that's like the same price
you paid in 1980.

7974
02:23:01,610 --> 02:23:01,620
you paid in 1980.
 

7975
02:23:01,620 --> 02:23:02,690
you paid in 1980.
what the hell

7976
02:23:02,690 --> 02:23:02,700
what the hell
 

7977
02:23:02,700 --> 02:23:04,309
what the hell
so you would see a lot of innovation

7978
02:23:04,309 --> 02:23:04,319
so you would see a lot of innovation
 

7979
02:23:04,319 --> 02:23:06,530
so you would see a lot of innovation
yeah maybe it'd have maybe have some

7980
02:23:06,530 --> 02:23:06,540
yeah maybe it'd have maybe have some
 

7981
02:23:06,540 --> 02:23:08,990
yeah maybe it'd have maybe have some
hyperloops yeah right and I'm willing to

7982
02:23:08,990 --> 02:23:09,000
hyperloops yeah right and I'm willing to
 

7983
02:23:09,000 --> 02:23:10,250
hyperloops yeah right and I'm willing to
make that trade-off right I'm willing to

7984
02:23:10,250 --> 02:23:10,260
make that trade-off right I'm willing to
 

7985
02:23:10,260 --> 02:23:11,750
make that trade-off right I'm willing to
pay and this is why you know people

7986
02:23:11,750 --> 02:23:11,760
pay and this is why you know people
 

7987
02:23:11,760 --> 02:23:13,429
pay and this is why you know people
think that like dictators take power

7988
02:23:13,429 --> 02:23:13,439
think that like dictators take power
 

7989
02:23:13,439 --> 02:23:16,190
think that like dictators take power
through some like through some untoward

7990
02:23:16,190 --> 02:23:16,200
through some like through some untoward
 

7991
02:23:16,200 --> 02:23:18,170
through some like through some untoward
mechanism sometimes they do but usually

7992
02:23:18,170 --> 02:23:18,180
mechanism sometimes they do but usually
 

7993
02:23:18,180 --> 02:23:20,510
mechanism sometimes they do but usually
it's because the people want them and

7994
02:23:20,510 --> 02:23:20,520
it's because the people want them and
 

7995
02:23:20,520 --> 02:23:23,210
it's because the people want them and
the downsides of a dictatorship I feel

7996
02:23:23,210 --> 02:23:23,220
the downsides of a dictatorship I feel
 

7997
02:23:23,220 --> 02:23:24,290
the downsides of a dictatorship I feel
like we've gotten to a point now with

7998
02:23:24,290 --> 02:23:24,300
like we've gotten to a point now with
 

7999
02:23:24,300 --> 02:23:25,790
like we've gotten to a point now with
the oligarchy where

8000
02:23:25,790 --> 02:23:25,800
the oligarchy where
 

8001
02:23:25,800 --> 02:23:30,290
the oligarchy where
yeah I would prefer the dictator

8002
02:23:30,290 --> 02:23:30,300

 

8003
02:23:30,300 --> 02:23:32,270

uh what do you think about Scala as a

8004
02:23:32,270 --> 02:23:32,280
uh what do you think about Scala as a
 

8005
02:23:32,280 --> 02:23:34,929
uh what do you think about Scala as a
programming language

8006
02:23:34,929 --> 02:23:34,939

 

8007
02:23:34,939 --> 02:23:37,550

I liked it more than I thought I did the

8008
02:23:37,550 --> 02:23:37,560
I liked it more than I thought I did the
 

8009
02:23:37,560 --> 02:23:38,929
I liked it more than I thought I did the
tutorials like I was very new to it like

8010
02:23:38,929 --> 02:23:38,939
tutorials like I was very new to it like
 

8011
02:23:38,939 --> 02:23:40,130
tutorials like I was very new to it like
it would take me six months to be able

8012
02:23:40,130 --> 02:23:40,140
it would take me six months to be able
 

8013
02:23:40,140 --> 02:23:42,290
it would take me six months to be able
to write like good scholar I mean what

8014
02:23:42,290 --> 02:23:42,300
to write like good scholar I mean what
 

8015
02:23:42,300 --> 02:23:43,429
to write like good scholar I mean what
did you learn about learning a new

8016
02:23:43,429 --> 02:23:43,439
did you learn about learning a new
 

8017
02:23:43,439 --> 02:23:45,050
did you learn about learning a new
programming language from that

8018
02:23:45,050 --> 02:23:45,060
programming language from that
 

8019
02:23:45,060 --> 02:23:46,429
programming language from that
um I love I love doing like new

8020
02:23:46,429 --> 02:23:46,439
um I love I love doing like new
 

8021
02:23:46,439 --> 02:23:47,690
um I love I love doing like new
programming like tutorials and doing

8022
02:23:47,690 --> 02:23:47,700
programming like tutorials and doing
 

8023
02:23:47,700 --> 02:23:51,429
programming like tutorials and doing
them I did all this for rust uh

8024
02:23:51,429 --> 02:23:51,439
them I did all this for rust uh
 

8025
02:23:51,439 --> 02:23:54,110
them I did all this for rust uh
it keeps some of it's upsetting jvm

8026
02:23:54,110 --> 02:23:54,120
it keeps some of it's upsetting jvm
 

8027
02:23:54,120 --> 02:23:57,349
it keeps some of it's upsetting jvm
routes but it is a much nicer in fact I

8028
02:23:57,349 --> 02:23:57,359
routes but it is a much nicer in fact I
 

8029
02:23:57,359 --> 02:23:59,090
routes but it is a much nicer in fact I
almost don't know why kotlin took off

8030
02:23:59,090 --> 02:23:59,100
almost don't know why kotlin took off
 

8031
02:23:59,100 --> 02:24:01,849
almost don't know why kotlin took off
and not Scala I think Scala has some

8032
02:24:01,849 --> 02:24:01,859
and not Scala I think Scala has some
 

8033
02:24:01,859 --> 02:24:04,450
and not Scala I think Scala has some
beauty that kotlin lacked

8034
02:24:04,450 --> 02:24:04,460
beauty that kotlin lacked
 

8035
02:24:04,460 --> 02:24:07,550
beauty that kotlin lacked
uh whereas kotlin felt a lot more

8036
02:24:07,550 --> 02:24:07,560
uh whereas kotlin felt a lot more
 

8037
02:24:07,560 --> 02:24:09,230
uh whereas kotlin felt a lot more
I mean it was almost like I don't know

8038
02:24:09,230 --> 02:24:09,240
I mean it was almost like I don't know
 

8039
02:24:09,240 --> 02:24:10,550
I mean it was almost like I don't know
if it actually was a response to Swift

8040
02:24:10,550 --> 02:24:10,560
if it actually was a response to Swift
 

8041
02:24:10,560 --> 02:24:11,870
if it actually was a response to Swift
but that's kind of what it felt like

8042
02:24:11,870 --> 02:24:11,880
but that's kind of what it felt like
 

8043
02:24:11,880 --> 02:24:13,790
but that's kind of what it felt like
like kotlin looks more like Swift and

8044
02:24:13,790 --> 02:24:13,800
like kotlin looks more like Swift and
 

8045
02:24:13,800 --> 02:24:15,889
like kotlin looks more like Swift and
Scala looks more like well like a

8046
02:24:15,889 --> 02:24:15,899
Scala looks more like well like a
 

8047
02:24:15,899 --> 02:24:17,030
Scala looks more like well like a
functional part of my language more like

8048
02:24:17,030 --> 02:24:17,040
functional part of my language more like
 

8049
02:24:17,040 --> 02:24:18,889
functional part of my language more like
like an old camel or a Haskell let's

8050
02:24:18,889 --> 02:24:18,899
like an old camel or a Haskell let's
 

8051
02:24:18,899 --> 02:24:20,870
like an old camel or a Haskell let's
actually just explore we touched it a

8052
02:24:20,870 --> 02:24:20,880
actually just explore we touched it a
 

8053
02:24:20,880 --> 02:24:23,330
actually just explore we touched it a
little bit but just on the art the

8054
02:24:23,330 --> 02:24:23,340
little bit but just on the art the
 

8055
02:24:23,340 --> 02:24:25,309
little bit but just on the art the
science and the Art of programming oh

8056
02:24:25,309 --> 02:24:25,319
science and the Art of programming oh
 

8057
02:24:25,319 --> 02:24:26,870
science and the Art of programming oh
for you personally how much of your

8058
02:24:26,870 --> 02:24:26,880
for you personally how much of your
 

8059
02:24:26,880 --> 02:24:28,670
for you personally how much of your
programming is done with GPT currently

8060
02:24:28,670 --> 02:24:28,680
programming is done with GPT currently
 

8061
02:24:28,680 --> 02:24:31,790
programming is done with GPT currently
none none I don't use it at all

8062
02:24:31,790 --> 02:24:31,800
none none I don't use it at all
 

8063
02:24:31,800 --> 02:24:34,010
none none I don't use it at all
because you prioritize simplicity so

8064
02:24:34,010 --> 02:24:34,020
because you prioritize simplicity so
 

8065
02:24:34,020 --> 02:24:34,849
because you prioritize simplicity so
much

8066

much
 

8067
02:24:34,859 --> 02:24:38,090
much
yeah I find that a lot of it is noise I

8068
02:24:38,090 --> 02:24:38,100
yeah I find that a lot of it is noise I
 

8069
02:24:38,100 --> 02:24:40,190
yeah I find that a lot of it is noise I
do use vs code

8070
02:24:40,190 --> 02:24:40,200
do use vs code
 

8071
02:24:40,200 --> 02:24:42,530
do use vs code
um and I do like some amount of

8072
02:24:42,530 --> 02:24:42,540
um and I do like some amount of
 

8073
02:24:42,540 --> 02:24:45,349
um and I do like some amount of
autocomplete I do like like a very um a

8074
02:24:45,349 --> 02:24:45,359
autocomplete I do like like a very um a
 

8075
02:24:45,359 --> 02:24:46,670
autocomplete I do like like a very um a
very like Feels Like rules based

8076
02:24:46,670 --> 02:24:46,680
very like Feels Like rules based
 

8077
02:24:46,680 --> 02:24:48,770
very like Feels Like rules based
autocomplete like an autocomplete it's

8078
02:24:48,770 --> 02:24:48,780
autocomplete like an autocomplete it's
 

8079
02:24:48,780 --> 02:24:49,910
autocomplete like an autocomplete it's
going to complete the variable name for

8080
02:24:49,910 --> 02:24:49,920
going to complete the variable name for
 

8081
02:24:49,920 --> 02:24:50,990
going to complete the variable name for
me so I'm going to type it I can just

8082
02:24:50,990 --> 02:24:51,000
me so I'm going to type it I can just
 

8083
02:24:51,000 --> 02:24:53,150
me so I'm going to type it I can just
press tab right that's nice but I don't

8084
02:24:53,150 --> 02:24:53,160
press tab right that's nice but I don't
 

8085
02:24:53,160 --> 02:24:54,530
press tab right that's nice but I don't
want it autocomplete you know what I

8086
02:24:54,530 --> 02:24:54,540
want it autocomplete you know what I
 

8087
02:24:54,540 --> 02:24:56,150
want it autocomplete you know what I
hate when autocompletes when I type the

8088
02:24:56,150 --> 02:24:56,160
hate when autocompletes when I type the
 

8089
02:24:56,160 --> 02:24:58,790
hate when autocompletes when I type the
word for and it like puts like two two

8090
02:24:58,790 --> 02:24:58,800
word for and it like puts like two two
 

8091
02:24:58,800 --> 02:25:00,469
word for and it like puts like two two
parentheses and two semicolons and two

8092
02:25:00,469 --> 02:25:00,479
parentheses and two semicolons and two
 

8093
02:25:00,479 --> 02:25:02,389
parentheses and two semicolons and two
braces I'm like

8094
02:25:02,389 --> 02:25:02,399
braces I'm like
 

8095
02:25:02,399 --> 02:25:06,410
braces I'm like
what I mean with the vs code and GPT

8096
02:25:06,410 --> 02:25:06,420
what I mean with the vs code and GPT
 

8097
02:25:06,420 --> 02:25:09,650
what I mean with the vs code and GPT
with codex you can um

8098
02:25:09,650 --> 02:25:09,660
with codex you can um
 

8099
02:25:09,660 --> 02:25:13,610
with codex you can um
you can kind of brainstorm I I find

8100
02:25:13,610 --> 02:25:13,620
you can kind of brainstorm I I find
 

8101
02:25:13,620 --> 02:25:16,550
you can kind of brainstorm I I find
I'm like probably the same as you but I

8102
02:25:16,550 --> 02:25:16,560
I'm like probably the same as you but I
 

8103
02:25:16,560 --> 02:25:18,950
I'm like probably the same as you but I
like that it generates code and you

8104
02:25:18,950 --> 02:25:18,960
like that it generates code and you
 

8105
02:25:18,960 --> 02:25:20,510
like that it generates code and you
basically disagree with it and write

8106
02:25:20,510 --> 02:25:20,520
basically disagree with it and write
 

8107
02:25:20,520 --> 02:25:22,790
basically disagree with it and write
something simpler but to me that somehow

8108
02:25:22,790 --> 02:25:22,800
something simpler but to me that somehow
 

8109
02:25:22,800 --> 02:25:25,670
something simpler but to me that somehow
is like inspiring it makes me feel good

8110
02:25:25,670 --> 02:25:25,680
is like inspiring it makes me feel good
 

8111
02:25:25,680 --> 02:25:27,230
is like inspiring it makes me feel good
it's also gamifies the simplification

8112
02:25:27,230 --> 02:25:27,240
it's also gamifies the simplification
 

8113
02:25:27,240 --> 02:25:29,570
it's also gamifies the simplification
process because I'm like oh yeah you

8114
02:25:29,570 --> 02:25:29,580
process because I'm like oh yeah you
 

8115
02:25:29,580 --> 02:25:31,730
process because I'm like oh yeah you
dumb AI system you think is the way to

8116
02:25:31,730 --> 02:25:31,740
dumb AI system you think is the way to
 

8117
02:25:31,740 --> 02:25:33,650
dumb AI system you think is the way to
do it I have a simpler thing here it

8118
02:25:33,650 --> 02:25:33,660
do it I have a simpler thing here it
 

8119
02:25:33,660 --> 02:25:35,990
do it I have a simpler thing here it
just constantly reminds me of like like

8120
02:25:35,990 --> 02:25:36,000
just constantly reminds me of like like
 

8121
02:25:36,000 --> 02:25:37,969
just constantly reminds me of like like
bad stuff I mean I tried the same thing

8122
02:25:37,969 --> 02:25:37,979
bad stuff I mean I tried the same thing
 

8123
02:25:37,979 --> 02:25:39,230
bad stuff I mean I tried the same thing
with rap right I tried the same thing

8124
02:25:39,230 --> 02:25:39,240
with rap right I tried the same thing
 

8125
02:25:39,240 --> 02:25:40,309
with rap right I tried the same thing
with rap and I actually think of a much

8126
02:25:40,309 --> 02:25:40,319
with rap and I actually think of a much
 

8127
02:25:40,319 --> 02:25:42,110
with rap and I actually think of a much
better programmer than rapper but like I

8128
02:25:42,110 --> 02:25:42,120
better programmer than rapper but like I
 

8129
02:25:42,120 --> 02:25:43,309
better programmer than rapper but like I
even tried I was like okay can we get

8130
02:25:43,309 --> 02:25:43,319
even tried I was like okay can we get
 

8131
02:25:43,319 --> 02:25:44,690
even tried I was like okay can we get
some inspiration from these things for

8132
02:25:44,690 --> 02:25:44,700
some inspiration from these things for
 

8133
02:25:44,700 --> 02:25:46,010
some inspiration from these things for
some rap lyrics

8134
02:25:46,010 --> 02:25:46,020
some rap lyrics
 

8135
02:25:46,020 --> 02:25:47,809
some rap lyrics
and I just found that it would go back

8136
02:25:47,809 --> 02:25:47,819
and I just found that it would go back
 

8137
02:25:47,819 --> 02:25:50,570
and I just found that it would go back
to the most like cringy tropes and dumb

8138
02:25:50,570 --> 02:25:50,580
to the most like cringy tropes and dumb
 

8139
02:25:50,580 --> 02:25:53,030
to the most like cringy tropes and dumb
rhyme schemes and I'm like yeah this is

8140
02:25:53,030 --> 02:25:53,040
rhyme schemes and I'm like yeah this is
 

8141
02:25:53,040 --> 02:25:54,710
rhyme schemes and I'm like yeah this is
what the code looks like too

8142
02:25:54,710 --> 02:25:54,720
what the code looks like too
 

8143
02:25:54,720 --> 02:25:56,270
what the code looks like too
I I think you and I probably have

8144
02:25:56,270 --> 02:25:56,280
I I think you and I probably have
 

8145
02:25:56,280 --> 02:25:58,429
I I think you and I probably have
different thresholds for cringe code

8146
02:25:58,429 --> 02:25:58,439
different thresholds for cringe code
 

8147
02:25:58,439 --> 02:26:00,889
different thresholds for cringe code
they probably hate cringe code

8148
02:26:00,889 --> 02:26:00,899
they probably hate cringe code
 

8149
02:26:00,899 --> 02:26:02,630
they probably hate cringe code
so it's for you

8150
02:26:02,630 --> 02:26:02,640
so it's for you
 

8151
02:26:02,640 --> 02:26:04,990
so it's for you
and uh

8152
02:26:04,990 --> 02:26:05,000
and uh
 

8153
02:26:05,000 --> 02:26:09,290
and uh
boilerplate as a part of code

8154
02:26:09,290 --> 02:26:09,300

 

8155
02:26:09,300 --> 02:26:12,469

like some of it

8156
02:26:12,469 --> 02:26:12,479

 

8157
02:26:12,479 --> 02:26:14,870

yeah and some of it is just like faster

8158
02:26:14,870 --> 02:26:14,880
yeah and some of it is just like faster
 

8159
02:26:14,880 --> 02:26:16,790
yeah and some of it is just like faster
lookup

8160
02:26:16,790 --> 02:26:16,800
lookup
 

8161
02:26:16,800 --> 02:26:18,650
lookup
because I don't know about you but I

8162
02:26:18,650 --> 02:26:18,660
because I don't know about you but I
 

8163
02:26:18,660 --> 02:26:20,450
because I don't know about you but I
don't remember everything like I don't

8164
02:26:20,450 --> 02:26:20,460
don't remember everything like I don't
 

8165
02:26:20,460 --> 02:26:22,070
don't remember everything like I don't
I'm offloading so much of my memory

8166
02:26:22,070 --> 02:26:22,080
I'm offloading so much of my memory
 

8167
02:26:22,080 --> 02:26:24,230
I'm offloading so much of my memory
about like

8168
02:26:24,230 --> 02:26:24,240
about like
 

8169
02:26:24,240 --> 02:26:25,849
about like
um yeah different functions Library

8170
02:26:25,849 --> 02:26:25,859
um yeah different functions Library
 

8171
02:26:25,859 --> 02:26:27,770
um yeah different functions Library
functions all that kind of stuff like

8172
02:26:27,770 --> 02:26:27,780
functions all that kind of stuff like
 

8173
02:26:27,780 --> 02:26:31,550
functions all that kind of stuff like
this GPS is very fast at standard stuff

8174
02:26:31,550 --> 02:26:31,560
this GPS is very fast at standard stuff
 

8175
02:26:31,560 --> 02:26:33,050
this GPS is very fast at standard stuff
and like

8176
02:26:33,050 --> 02:26:33,060
and like
 

8177
02:26:33,060 --> 02:26:35,750
and like

maybe if I was coding more in other
 

8189
02:26:47,819 --> 02:26:50,210
maybe if I was coding more in other
languages I would consider it more but I

02:26:50,210 --> 02:26:50,220
languages I would consider it more but I
 

8191
02:26:50,220 --> 02:26:52,010

02:29:22,250 --> 02:29:22,260
uh you wrote a bug on line 14 and here's
 

8335
02:29:22,260 --> 02:29:23,270
uh you wrote a bug on line 14 and here's
what it is

8336
02:29:23,270 --> 02:29:23,280
what it is
 

8337
02:29:23,280 --> 02:29:25,370
what it is
yeah now I like that you know what does

8338
02:29:25,370 --> 02:29:25,380
yeah now I like that you know what does
 

8339
02:29:25,380 --> 02:29:28,429
yeah now I like that you know what does
a good job of this my pie I love my mind

8340
02:29:28,429 --> 02:29:28,439
a good job of this my pie I love my mind
 

8341
02:29:28,439 --> 02:29:30,530
a good job of this my pie I love my mind
my pipe is fancy type checker for python

8342
02:29:30,530 --> 02:29:30,540
my pipe is fancy type checker for python
 

8343
02:29:30,540 --> 02:29:31,250
my pipe is fancy type checker for python
yeah

8344
02:29:31,250 --> 02:29:31,260
yeah
 

8345
02:29:31,260 --> 02:29:32,510
yeah
um and actually I tried like Microsoft

8346
02:29:32,510 --> 02:29:32,520
um and actually I tried like Microsoft
 

8347
02:29:32,520 --> 02:29:34,849
um and actually I tried like Microsoft
released one too and it was like

8348
02:29:34,849 --> 02:29:34,859
released one too and it was like
 

8349
02:29:34,859 --> 02:29:37,610
released one too and it was like
60 false positives my pie is like five

8350
02:29:37,610 --> 02:29:37,620
60 false positives my pie is like five
 

8351
02:29:37,620 --> 02:29:39,349
60 false positives my pie is like five
percent false positives ninety five

8352
02:29:39,349 --> 02:29:39,359
percent false positives ninety five
 

8353
02:29:39,359 --> 02:29:41,630
percent false positives ninety five
percent of the time it recognizes I

8354
02:29:41,630 --> 02:29:41,640
percent of the time it recognizes I
 

8355
02:29:41,640 --> 02:29:42,710
percent of the time it recognizes I
didn't really think about that typing

8356
02:29:42,710 --> 02:29:42,720
didn't really think about that typing
 

8357
02:29:42,720 --> 02:29:44,450
didn't really think about that typing
interaction correctly thank you my pie

8358
02:29:44,450 --> 02:29:44,460
interaction correctly thank you my pie
 

8359
02:29:44,460 --> 02:29:47,750
interaction correctly thank you my pie
so you like uh Thai painting you liked

8360
02:29:47,750 --> 02:29:47,760
so you like uh Thai painting you liked
 

8361
02:29:47,760 --> 02:29:49,429
so you like uh Thai painting you liked
you like pushing the language towards

8362
02:29:49,429 --> 02:29:49,439
you like pushing the language towards
 

8363
02:29:49,439 --> 02:29:51,469
you like pushing the language towards
towards being a typed language oh yeah

8364
02:29:51,469 --> 02:29:51,479
towards being a typed language oh yeah
 

8365
02:29:51,479 --> 02:29:53,090
towards being a typed language oh yeah
absolutely I think I think optional

8366
02:29:53,090 --> 02:29:53,100
absolutely I think I think optional
 

8367
02:29:53,100 --> 02:29:55,250
absolutely I think I think optional
typing is is great

8368
02:29:55,250 --> 02:29:55,260
typing is is great
 

8369
02:29:55,260 --> 02:29:56,690
typing is is great
I think that like it's like a meet in

8370
02:29:56,690 --> 02:29:56,700
I think that like it's like a meet in
 

8371
02:29:56,700 --> 02:29:57,830
I think that like it's like a meet in
the middle right like python has these

8372
02:29:57,830 --> 02:29:57,840
the middle right like python has these
 

8373
02:29:57,840 --> 02:29:59,690
the middle right like python has these
optional type hinting and like C plus

8374
02:29:59,690 --> 02:29:59,700
optional type hinting and like C plus
 

8375
02:29:59,700 --> 02:30:02,050
optional type hinting and like C plus
has Auto

8376
02:30:02,050 --> 02:30:02,060
has Auto
 

8377
02:30:02,060 --> 02:30:04,250
has Auto
allows you to take a step back well C

8378
02:30:04,250 --> 02:30:04,260
allows you to take a step back well C
 

8379
02:30:04,260 --> 02:30:05,809
allows you to take a step back well C
plus plus would have you brutally type

8380
02:30:05,809 --> 02:30:05,819
plus plus would have you brutally type
 

8381
02:30:05,819 --> 02:30:08,630
plus plus would have you brutally type
out STD string iterator right now I just

8382
02:30:08,630 --> 02:30:08,640
out STD string iterator right now I just
 

8383
02:30:08,640 --> 02:30:10,730
out STD string iterator right now I just
type Auto which is nice and then python

8384
02:30:10,730 --> 02:30:10,740
type Auto which is nice and then python
 

8385
02:30:10,740 --> 02:30:12,110
type Auto which is nice and then python
used to just have

8386
02:30:12,110 --> 02:30:12,120
used to just have
 

8387
02:30:12,120 --> 02:30:14,929
used to just have
a what type is a

8388
02:30:14,929 --> 02:30:14,939
a what type is a
 

8389
02:30:14,939 --> 02:30:19,010
a what type is a
it's an a yeah um a colon Str oh okay

8390
02:30:19,010 --> 02:30:19,020
it's an a yeah um a colon Str oh okay
 

8391
02:30:19,020 --> 02:30:21,710
it's an a yeah um a colon Str oh okay
it's a string cool yeah I wish they were

8392
02:30:21,710 --> 02:30:21,720
it's a string cool yeah I wish they were
 

8393
02:30:21,720 --> 02:30:23,330
it's a string cool yeah I wish they were
I wish there was a way like a simple way

8394
02:30:23,330 --> 02:30:23,340
I wish there was a way like a simple way
 

8395
02:30:23,340 --> 02:30:26,330
I wish there was a way like a simple way
in Python to uh like turn on a mode

8396
02:30:26,330 --> 02:30:26,340
in Python to uh like turn on a mode
 

8397
02:30:26,340 --> 02:30:28,370
in Python to uh like turn on a mode
which would enforce the types

8398
02:30:28,370 --> 02:30:28,380
which would enforce the types
 

8399
02:30:28,380 --> 02:30:30,050
which would enforce the types
yeah like give a warning when there's no

8400
02:30:30,050 --> 02:30:30,060
yeah like give a warning when there's no
 

8401
02:30:30,060 --> 02:30:31,370
yeah like give a warning when there's no
type of something like this well no to

8402
02:30:31,370 --> 02:30:31,380
type of something like this well no to
 

8403
02:30:31,380 --> 02:30:33,170
type of something like this well no to
give a warning where like my pilot is a

8404
02:30:33,170 --> 02:30:33,180
give a warning where like my pilot is a
 

8405
02:30:33,180 --> 02:30:34,429
give a warning where like my pilot is a
static type Checker but I'm asking just

8406
02:30:34,429 --> 02:30:34,439
static type Checker but I'm asking just
 

8407
02:30:34,439 --> 02:30:35,929
static type Checker but I'm asking just
for a runtime dad Checker like there's

8408
02:30:35,929 --> 02:30:35,939
for a runtime dad Checker like there's
 

8409
02:30:35,939 --> 02:30:37,610
for a runtime dad Checker like there's
like ways to like hack this in but I

8410
02:30:37,610 --> 02:30:37,620
like ways to like hack this in but I
 

8411
02:30:37,620 --> 02:30:38,990
like ways to like hack this in but I
wish it was just like a flag like python

8412
02:30:38,990 --> 02:30:39,000
wish it was just like a flag like python
 

8413
02:30:39,000 --> 02:30:40,309
wish it was just like a flag like python
3-t

8414
02:30:40,309 --> 02:30:40,319
3-t
 

8415
02:30:40,319 --> 02:30:42,650
3-t
oh I see yeah I see enforce the types

8416
02:30:42,650 --> 02:30:42,660
oh I see yeah I see enforce the types
 

8417
02:30:42,660 --> 02:30:44,389
oh I see yeah I see enforce the types
are one time yeah I feel like that makes

8418
02:30:44,389 --> 02:30:44,399
are one time yeah I feel like that makes
 

8419
02:30:44,399 --> 02:30:46,130
are one time yeah I feel like that makes
you a better programmer that that's the

8420
02:30:46,130 --> 02:30:46,140
you a better programmer that that's the
 

8421
02:30:46,140 --> 02:30:48,349
you a better programmer that that's the
kind of test right that the the type can

8422
02:30:48,349 --> 02:30:48,359
kind of test right that the the type can
 

8423
02:30:48,359 --> 02:30:50,389
kind of test right that the the type can
the type Remains the Same well that I

8424
02:30:50,389 --> 02:30:50,399
the type Remains the Same well that I
 

8425
02:30:50,399 --> 02:30:51,950
the type Remains the Same well that I
know that isn't like messenger types up

8426
02:30:51,950 --> 02:30:51,960
know that isn't like messenger types up
 

8427
02:30:51,960 --> 02:30:53,570
know that isn't like messenger types up
but again like my pie is getting really

8428
02:30:53,570 --> 02:30:53,580
but again like my pie is getting really
 

8429
02:30:53,580 --> 02:30:55,130
but again like my pie is getting really
good and I love it

8430
02:30:55,130 --> 02:30:55,140
good and I love it
 

8431
02:30:55,140 --> 02:30:56,750
good and I love it
um and I can't wait for some of these

8432
02:30:56,750 --> 02:30:56,760
um and I can't wait for some of these
 

8433
02:30:56,760 --> 02:30:59,030
um and I can't wait for some of these
tools to become ai-powered like I want

8434
02:30:59,030 --> 02:30:59,040
tools to become ai-powered like I want
 

8435
02:30:59,040 --> 02:31:00,710
tools to become ai-powered like I want
AIS reading my code and giving me

8436
02:31:00,710 --> 02:31:00,720
AIS reading my code and giving me
 

8437
02:31:00,720 --> 02:31:03,309
AIS reading my code and giving me
feedback I don't want AIS

8438
02:31:03,309 --> 02:31:03,319
feedback I don't want AIS
 

8439
02:31:03,319 --> 02:31:06,050
feedback I don't want AIS
writing half-assed autocomplete stuff

8440
02:31:06,050 --> 02:31:06,060
writing half-assed autocomplete stuff
 

8441
02:31:06,060 --> 02:31:09,050
writing half-assed autocomplete stuff
for me I wonder if you can now take GPT

8442
02:31:09,050 --> 02:31:09,060
for me I wonder if you can now take GPT
 

8443
02:31:09,060 --> 02:31:10,910
for me I wonder if you can now take GPT
and give it a code that you wrote for

8444
02:31:10,910 --> 02:31:10,920
and give it a code that you wrote for
 

8445
02:31:10,920 --> 02:31:12,650
and give it a code that you wrote for
function and say how can I make this

8446
02:31:12,650 --> 02:31:12,660
function and say how can I make this
 

8447
02:31:12,660 --> 02:31:14,510
function and say how can I make this
simpler and have it accomplish the same

8448
02:31:14,510 --> 02:31:14,520
simpler and have it accomplish the same
 

8449
02:31:14,520 --> 02:31:15,290
simpler and have it accomplish the same
thing

8450
02:31:15,290 --> 02:31:15,300
thing
 

8451
02:31:15,300 --> 02:31:16,849
thing
I think you'll get some good ideas on

8452
02:31:16,849 --> 02:31:16,859
I think you'll get some good ideas on
 

8453
02:31:16,859 --> 02:31:20,330
I think you'll get some good ideas on
some code maybe not the code you write

8454
02:31:20,330 --> 02:31:20,340
some code maybe not the code you write
 

8455
02:31:20,340 --> 02:31:22,250
some code maybe not the code you write
um for timing right type of code because

8456
02:31:22,250 --> 02:31:22,260
um for timing right type of code because
 

8457
02:31:22,260 --> 02:31:24,290
um for timing right type of code because
that requires so much design thinking

8458
02:31:24,290 --> 02:31:24,300
that requires so much design thinking
 

8459
02:31:24,300 --> 02:31:26,690
that requires so much design thinking
but like other kinds of code I don't

8460
02:31:26,690 --> 02:31:26,700
but like other kinds of code I don't
 

8461
02:31:26,700 --> 02:31:28,910
but like other kinds of code I don't
know I downloaded that plug-in maybe

8462
02:31:28,910 --> 02:31:28,920
know I downloaded that plug-in maybe
 

8463
02:31:28,920 --> 02:31:30,830
know I downloaded that plug-in maybe
like two months ago I tried it again and

8464
02:31:30,830 --> 02:31:30,840
like two months ago I tried it again and
 

8465
02:31:30,840 --> 02:31:33,710
like two months ago I tried it again and
found the same look I don't doubt that

8466
02:31:33,710 --> 02:31:33,720
found the same look I don't doubt that
 

8467
02:31:33,720 --> 02:31:36,950
found the same look I don't doubt that
these models are going to first become

8468
02:31:36,950 --> 02:31:36,960
these models are going to first become
 

8469
02:31:36,960 --> 02:31:39,050
these models are going to first become
useful to me then be as good as me and

8470
02:31:39,050 --> 02:31:39,060
useful to me then be as good as me and
 

8471
02:31:39,060 --> 02:31:40,309
useful to me then be as good as me and
then surpass me

8472
02:31:40,309 --> 02:31:40,319
then surpass me
 

8473
02:31:40,319 --> 02:31:41,630
then surpass me
but

8474
02:31:41,630 --> 02:31:41,640
but
 

8475
02:31:41,640 --> 02:31:44,389
but
from what I've seen today it's like it's

8476
02:31:44,389 --> 02:31:44,399
from what I've seen today it's like it's
 

8477
02:31:44,399 --> 02:31:45,830
from what I've seen today it's like it's
like like

8478
02:31:45,830 --> 02:31:45,840
like like
 

8479
02:31:45,840 --> 02:31:48,950
like like
someone you know occasionally taking

8480
02:31:48,950 --> 02:31:48,960
someone you know occasionally taking
 

8481
02:31:48,960 --> 02:31:50,809
someone you know occasionally taking
over my keyboard that I hired from

8482
02:31:50,809 --> 02:31:50,819
over my keyboard that I hired from
 

8483
02:31:50,819 --> 02:31:53,230
over my keyboard that I hired from
Fiverr yeah

8484
02:31:53,230 --> 02:31:53,240
Fiverr yeah
 

8485
02:31:53,240 --> 02:31:56,030
Fiverr yeah
ideas about how to debug the code or

8486
02:31:56,030 --> 02:31:56,040
ideas about how to debug the code or
 

8487
02:31:56,040 --> 02:31:58,130
ideas about how to debug the code or
basically a better debugger is really

8488
02:31:58,130 --> 02:31:58,140
basically a better debugger is really
 

8489
02:31:58,140 --> 02:31:59,450
basically a better debugger is really

company and the thing pretty much just
is a GitHub repo

8658
02:34:51,889 --> 02:34:51,899
is a GitHub repo
 

8659
02:34:51,899 --> 02:34:54,650
is a GitHub repo
is like showing me kind of what the

8660
02:34:54,650 --> 02:34:54,660
is like showing me kind of what the
 

8661
02:34:54,660 --> 02:34:56,270
is like showing me kind of what the
future of okay so a lot of times I'll go

8662
02:34:56,270 --> 02:34:56,280
future of okay so a lot of times I'll go
 

8663
02:34:56,280 --> 02:34:58,490
future of okay so a lot of times I'll go
on a Discord or kind of grad Discord and

8664
02:34:58,490 --> 02:34:58,500
on a Discord or kind of grad Discord and
 

8665
02:34:58,500 --> 02:35:00,050
on a Discord or kind of grad Discord and
I'll throw out some random like hey you

8666
02:35:00,050 --> 02:35:00,060
I'll throw out some random like hey you
 

8667
02:35:00,060 --> 02:35:01,429
I'll throw out some random like hey you
know can you change instead of having

8668
02:35:01,429 --> 02:35:01,439
know can you change instead of having
 

8669
02:35:01,439 --> 02:35:04,670
know can you change instead of having
log and X as LL Ops change it to log 2

8670
02:35:04,670 --> 02:35:04,680
log and X as LL Ops change it to log 2
 

8671
02:35:04,680 --> 02:35:05,870
log and X as LL Ops change it to log 2
and X2

8672
02:35:05,870 --> 02:35:05,880
and X2
 

8673
02:35:05,880 --> 02:35:07,370
and X2
it's a pretty small change you can

8674
02:35:07,370 --> 02:35:07,380
it's a pretty small change you can
 

8675
02:35:07,380 --> 02:35:09,590
it's a pretty small change you can
choose like change your base formula

8676
02:35:09,590 --> 02:35:09,600
choose like change your base formula
 

8677
02:35:09,600 --> 02:35:12,110
choose like change your base formula
um that's the kind of task that I can

8678
02:35:12,110 --> 02:35:12,120
um that's the kind of task that I can
 

8679
02:35:12,120 --> 02:35:14,030
um that's the kind of task that I can
see in AI being able to do in a few

8680
02:35:14,030 --> 02:35:14,040
see in AI being able to do in a few
 

8681
02:35:14,040 --> 02:35:14,690
see in AI being able to do in a few
years

8682
02:35:14,690 --> 02:35:14,700
years
 

8683
02:35:14,700 --> 02:35:16,190
years
like in a few years I could see myself

8684
02:35:16,190 --> 02:35:16,200
like in a few years I could see myself
 

8685
02:35:16,200 --> 02:35:18,590
like in a few years I could see myself
describing that and then within 30

8686
02:35:18,590 --> 02:35:18,600
describing that and then within 30
 

8687
02:35:18,600 --> 02:35:20,090
describing that and then within 30
seconds a pull request is up that does

8688
02:35:20,090 --> 02:35:20,100
seconds a pull request is up that does
 

8689
02:35:20,100 --> 02:35:22,309
seconds a pull request is up that does
it and it passes my CI and I merge it

8690
02:35:22,309 --> 02:35:22,319
it and it passes my CI and I merge it
 

8691
02:35:22,319 --> 02:35:24,590
it and it passes my CI and I merge it
right so I really started thinking about

8692
02:35:24,590 --> 02:35:24,600
right so I really started thinking about
 

8693
02:35:24,600 --> 02:35:27,950
right so I really started thinking about
like well what is the future of

8694
02:35:27,950 --> 02:35:27,960
like well what is the future of
 

8695
02:35:27,960 --> 02:35:30,230
like well what is the future of
jobs how many AIS can I employ at my

8696
02:35:30,230 --> 02:35:30,240
jobs how many AIS can I employ at my
 

8697
02:35:30,240 --> 02:35:31,730
jobs how many AIS can I employ at my
company as soon as we get the first Tiny

8698
02:35:31,730 --> 02:35:31,740
company as soon as we get the first Tiny
 

8699
02:35:31,740 --> 02:35:33,889
company as soon as we get the first Tiny
Box up I'm going to stand up a 65b llama

8700
02:35:33,889 --> 02:35:33,899
Box up I'm going to stand up a 65b llama
 

8701
02:35:33,899 --> 02:35:36,230
Box up I'm going to stand up a 65b llama
in the Discord and it's like yeah here's

8702
02:35:36,230 --> 02:35:36,240
in the Discord and it's like yeah here's
 

8703
02:35:36,240 --> 02:35:37,309
in the Discord and it's like yeah here's
the Tiny Box he's just like he's

8704
02:35:37,309 --> 02:35:37,319
the Tiny Box he's just like he's
 

8705
02:35:37,319 --> 02:35:38,870
the Tiny Box he's just like he's
chilling with us

8706
02:35:38,870 --> 02:35:38,880
chilling with us
 

8707
02:35:38,880 --> 02:35:40,550
chilling with us
basically

8708
02:35:40,550 --> 02:35:40,560
basically
 

8709
02:35:40,560 --> 02:35:42,730
basically
I mean like you said with niches the

8710
02:35:42,730 --> 02:35:42,740
I mean like you said with niches the
 

8711
02:35:42,740 --> 02:35:45,950
I mean like you said with niches the
most human jobs

8712
02:35:45,950 --> 02:35:45,960
most human jobs
 

8713
02:35:45,960 --> 02:35:47,750
most human jobs
will eventually be replaced with prompt

8714
02:35:47,750 --> 02:35:47,760
will eventually be replaced with prompt
 

8715
02:35:47,760 --> 02:35:50,090
will eventually be replaced with prompt
engineering well prompt engineering kind

8716
02:35:50,090 --> 02:35:50,100
engineering well prompt engineering kind
 

8717
02:35:50,100 --> 02:35:53,750
engineering well prompt engineering kind
of is this like as you like move up the

8718
02:35:53,750 --> 02:35:53,760
of is this like as you like move up the
 

8719
02:35:53,760 --> 02:35:56,210
of is this like as you like move up the
stack right like okay there used to be

8720
02:35:56,210 --> 02:35:56,220
stack right like okay there used to be
 

8721
02:35:56,220 --> 02:35:57,889
stack right like okay there used to be
humans actually doing

8722
02:35:57,889 --> 02:35:57,899
humans actually doing
 

8723
02:35:57,899 --> 02:35:59,630
humans actually doing
um arithmetic by hand right there used

8724
02:35:59,630 --> 02:35:59,640
um arithmetic by hand right there used
 

8725
02:35:59,640 --> 02:36:00,950
um arithmetic by hand right there used
to be like big forms of people doing

8726
02:36:00,950 --> 02:36:00,960
to be like big forms of people doing
 

8727
02:36:00,960 --> 02:36:03,410
to be like big forms of people doing
doing pluses and stuff right and then

8728
02:36:03,410 --> 02:36:03,420
doing pluses and stuff right and then
 

8729
02:36:03,420 --> 02:36:05,389
doing pluses and stuff right and then
you have like spreadsheets right and

8730
02:36:05,389 --> 02:36:05,399
you have like spreadsheets right and
 

8731
02:36:05,399 --> 02:36:06,770
you have like spreadsheets right and
then okay the spreadsheet can do the

8732
02:36:06,770 --> 02:36:06,780
then okay the spreadsheet can do the
 

8733
02:36:06,780 --> 02:36:08,270
then okay the spreadsheet can do the
Plus for me and then you have like

8734
02:36:08,270 --> 02:36:08,280
Plus for me and then you have like
 

8735
02:36:08,280 --> 02:36:10,670
Plus for me and then you have like
macros right and then you have like

8736
02:36:10,670 --> 02:36:10,680
macros right and then you have like
 

8737
02:36:10,680 --> 02:36:11,809
macros right and then you have like
things that basically just are

8738
02:36:11,809 --> 02:36:11,819
things that basically just are
 

8739
02:36:11,819 --> 02:36:13,610
things that basically just are
spreadsheets under the hood right like

8740
02:36:13,610 --> 02:36:13,620
spreadsheets under the hood right like
 

8741
02:36:13,620 --> 02:36:15,950
spreadsheets under the hood right like
like accounting software

8742
02:36:15,950 --> 02:36:15,960
like accounting software
 

8743
02:36:15,960 --> 02:36:17,210
like accounting software
um

8744
02:36:17,210 --> 02:36:17,220
um
 

8745
02:36:17,220 --> 02:36:19,250
um
as we move further up the abstraction

8746
02:36:19,250 --> 02:36:19,260
as we move further up the abstraction
 

8747
02:36:19,260 --> 02:36:20,570
as we move further up the abstraction
what's at the top of the abstraction

8748
02:36:20,570 --> 02:36:20,580
what's at the top of the abstraction
 

8749
02:36:20,580 --> 02:36:22,370
what's at the top of the abstraction
stack well the prompt engineer

8750
02:36:22,370 --> 02:36:22,380
stack well the prompt engineer
 

8751
02:36:22,380 --> 02:36:25,190
stack well the prompt engineer
yeah right what is what is the last

8752
02:36:25,190 --> 02:36:25,200
yeah right what is what is the last
 

8753
02:36:25,200 --> 02:36:27,530
yeah right what is what is the last
thing if you think about like humans

8754
02:36:27,530 --> 02:36:27,540
thing if you think about like humans
 

8755
02:36:27,540 --> 02:36:29,870
thing if you think about like humans
wanting to keep control

8756
02:36:29,870 --> 02:36:29,880
wanting to keep control
 

8757
02:36:29,880 --> 02:36:31,849
wanting to keep control
well what am I really in the company but

8758
02:36:31,849 --> 02:36:31,859
well what am I really in the company but
 

8759
02:36:31,859 --> 02:36:34,250
well what am I really in the company but
a prompt engineer right is there a

8760
02:36:34,250 --> 02:36:34,260
a prompt engineer right is there a
 

8761
02:36:34,260 --> 02:36:36,349
a prompt engineer right is there a
certain point where the AI will be

8762
02:36:36,349 --> 02:36:36,359
certain point where the AI will be
 

8763
02:36:36,359 --> 02:36:38,450
certain point where the AI will be
better at writing prompts

8764
02:36:38,450 --> 02:36:38,460
better at writing prompts
 

8765
02:36:38,460 --> 02:36:40,429
better at writing prompts
yeah but you see the problem with the AI

8766
02:36:40,429 --> 02:36:40,439
yeah but you see the problem with the AI
 

8767
02:36:40,439 --> 02:36:42,650
yeah but you see the problem with the AI
writing prompts a definition that I

8768
02:36:42,650 --> 02:36:42,660
writing prompts a definition that I
 

8769
02:36:42,660 --> 02:36:45,170
writing prompts a definition that I
always liked of AI was AI is the do what

8770
02:36:45,170 --> 02:36:45,180
always liked of AI was AI is the do what
 

8771
02:36:45,180 --> 02:36:46,670
always liked of AI was AI is the do what
I mean machine

8772
02:36:46,670 --> 02:36:46,680
I mean machine
 

8773
02:36:46,680 --> 02:36:50,210
I mean machine
AI is not the like the computer is so

8774
02:36:50,210 --> 02:36:50,220
AI is not the like the computer is so
 

8775
02:36:50,220 --> 02:36:53,809
AI is not the like the computer is so
pedantic it does what you say so

8776
02:36:53,809 --> 02:36:53,819
pedantic it does what you say so
 

8777
02:36:53,819 --> 02:36:55,250
pedantic it does what you say so
but you want to do what I mean machine

8778
02:36:55,250 --> 02:36:55,260
but you want to do what I mean machine
 

8779
02:36:55,260 --> 02:36:57,530
but you want to do what I mean machine
yeah right you want the machine where

8780
02:36:57,530 --> 02:36:57,540
yeah right you want the machine where
 

8781
02:36:57,540 --> 02:36:58,910
yeah right you want the machine where
you say you know get my grandmother out

8782
02:36:58,910 --> 02:36:58,920
you say you know get my grandmother out
 

8783
02:36:58,920 --> 02:37:00,590
you say you know get my grandmother out
of the burning house it like reasonably

8784
02:37:00,590 --> 02:37:00,600
of the burning house it like reasonably
 

8785
02:37:00,600 --> 02:37:01,849
of the burning house it like reasonably
takes your grandmother and puts her on

8786
02:37:01,849 --> 02:37:01,859
takes your grandmother and puts her on
 

8787
02:37:01,859 --> 02:37:03,530
takes your grandmother and puts her on
the ground not lifts her a thousand feet

8788
02:37:03,530 --> 02:37:03,540
the ground not lifts her a thousand feet
 

8789
02:37:03,540 --> 02:37:04,790
the ground not lifts her a thousand feet
above the burning house and lets her

8790
02:37:04,790 --> 02:37:04,800
above the burning house and lets her
 

8791
02:37:04,800 --> 02:37:10,910
above the burning house and lets her
fall right but yeah but

8792
02:37:10,910 --> 02:37:10,920

 

8793
02:37:10,920 --> 02:37:13,370

uh it's not going to find the meaning I

8794
02:37:13,370 --> 02:37:13,380
uh it's not going to find the meaning I
 

8795
02:37:13,380 --> 02:37:15,950
uh it's not going to find the meaning I
mean to do do what I mean it has to

8796
02:37:15,950 --> 02:37:15,960
mean to do do what I mean it has to
 

8797
02:37:15,960 --> 02:37:18,889
mean to do do what I mean it has to
figure stuff out sure and

8798
02:37:18,889 --> 02:37:18,899
figure stuff out sure and
 

8799
02:37:18,899 --> 02:37:21,650
figure stuff out sure and
the thing you'll maybe ask it to do is

8800
02:37:21,650 --> 02:37:21,660
the thing you'll maybe ask it to do is
 

8801
02:37:21,660 --> 02:37:24,770
the thing you'll maybe ask it to do is
run government for me oh and do what I

8802
02:37:24,770 --> 02:37:24,780
run government for me oh and do what I
 

8803
02:37:24,780 --> 02:37:26,570
run government for me oh and do what I
mean very much comes down to how aligned

8804
02:37:26,570 --> 02:37:26,580
mean very much comes down to how aligned
 

8805
02:37:26,580 --> 02:37:28,309
mean very much comes down to how aligned
is that AI with you

8806
02:37:28,309 --> 02:37:28,319
is that AI with you
 

8807
02:37:28,319 --> 02:37:31,550
is that AI with you
of course when you talk to an AI That's

8808
02:37:31,550 --> 02:37:31,560
of course when you talk to an AI That's
 

8809
02:37:31,560 --> 02:37:34,429
of course when you talk to an AI That's
made by a big company in the cloud the

8810
02:37:34,429 --> 02:37:34,439
made by a big company in the cloud the
 

8811
02:37:34,439 --> 02:37:37,309
made by a big company in the cloud the
AI fundamentally is aligned to them not

8812
02:37:37,309 --> 02:37:37,319
AI fundamentally is aligned to them not
 

8813
02:37:37,319 --> 02:37:39,110
AI fundamentally is aligned to them not
to you yeah and that's why you have to

8814
02:37:39,110 --> 02:37:39,120
to you yeah and that's why you have to
 

8815
02:37:39,120 --> 02:37:40,610
to you yeah and that's why you have to
buy a tiny box so you make sure the AI

8816
02:37:40,610 --> 02:37:40,620
buy a tiny box so you make sure the AI
 

8817
02:37:40,620 --> 02:37:43,070
buy a tiny box so you make sure the AI
stays aligned to you every time that

8818
02:37:43,070 --> 02:37:43,080
stays aligned to you every time that
 

8819
02:37:43,080 --> 02:37:44,809
stays aligned to you every time that
they start to pass you know AI

8820
02:37:44,809 --> 02:37:44,819
they start to pass you know AI
 

8821
02:37:44,819 --> 02:37:46,730
they start to pass you know AI
regulation or GPU regulation I'm going

8822
02:37:46,730 --> 02:37:46,740
regulation or GPU regulation I'm going
 

8823
02:37:46,740 --> 02:37:48,410
regulation or GPU regulation I'm going
to see sales of tiny boxes Spike right

8824
02:37:48,410 --> 02:37:48,420
to see sales of tiny boxes Spike right
 

8825
02:37:48,420 --> 02:37:49,969
to see sales of tiny boxes Spike right
it's gonna be like guns right every time

8826
02:37:49,969 --> 02:37:49,979
it's gonna be like guns right every time
 

8827
02:37:49,979 --> 02:37:52,370
it's gonna be like guns right every time
they talk about gun regulation boom

8828
02:37:52,370 --> 02:37:52,380
they talk about gun regulation boom
 

8829
02:37:52,380 --> 02:37:54,650
they talk about gun regulation boom
gun sales so in the space of AI you're

8830
02:37:54,650 --> 02:37:54,660
gun sales so in the space of AI you're
 

8831
02:37:54,660 --> 02:37:56,889
gun sales so in the space of AI you're
an anarchist anarchism

8832
02:37:56,889 --> 02:37:56,899
an anarchist anarchism
 

8833
02:37:56,899 --> 02:37:59,750
an anarchist anarchism
espouser unbeliever I'm an informational

8834
02:37:59,750 --> 02:37:59,760
espouser unbeliever I'm an informational
 

8835
02:37:59,760 --> 02:38:01,429
espouser unbeliever I'm an informational
Anarchist yes I'm an informational

8836
02:38:01,429 --> 02:38:01,439
Anarchist yes I'm an informational
 

8837
02:38:01,439 --> 02:38:04,510
Anarchist yes I'm an informational
Anarchist and a physical statist

8838
02:38:04,510 --> 02:38:04,520
Anarchist and a physical statist
 

8839
02:38:04,520 --> 02:38:06,710
Anarchist and a physical statist
I do not think Anarchy in the physical

8840
02:38:06,710 --> 02:38:06,720
I do not think Anarchy in the physical
 

8841
02:38:06,720 --> 02:38:08,330
I do not think Anarchy in the physical
world is very good because I exist in

8842
02:38:08,330 --> 02:38:08,340
world is very good because I exist in
 

8843
02:38:08,340 --> 02:38:09,770
world is very good because I exist in
the physical world but I think we can

8844
02:38:09,770 --> 02:38:09,780
the physical world but I think we can
 

8845
02:38:09,780 --> 02:38:11,750
the physical world but I think we can
construct this virtual world where

8846
02:38:11,750 --> 02:38:11,760
construct this virtual world where
 

8847
02:38:11,760 --> 02:38:13,790
construct this virtual world where
Anarchy it can't hurt you right I love

8848
02:38:13,790 --> 02:38:13,800
Anarchy it can't hurt you right I love
 

8849
02:38:13,800 --> 02:38:16,490
Anarchy it can't hurt you right I love
that Tyler the Creator uh tweet uh yo

8850
02:38:16,490 --> 02:38:16,500
that Tyler the Creator uh tweet uh yo
 

8851
02:38:16,500 --> 02:38:18,650
that Tyler the Creator uh tweet uh yo
cyber bullying isn't real man have you

8852
02:38:18,650 --> 02:38:18,660
cyber bullying isn't real man have you
 

8853
02:38:18,660 --> 02:38:20,809
cyber bullying isn't real man have you
tried turn it off the screen close your

8854
02:38:20,809 --> 02:38:20,819
tried turn it off the screen close your
 

8855
02:38:20,819 --> 02:38:24,610
tried turn it off the screen close your
eyes like yeah

8856
02:38:24,610 --> 02:38:24,620
eyes like yeah
 

8857
02:38:24,620 --> 02:38:27,190
eyes like yeah
but how do you

8858
02:38:27,190 --> 02:38:27,200
but how do you
 

8859
02:38:27,200 --> 02:38:31,969
but how do you
prevent the AI from basically replacing

8860
02:38:31,969 --> 02:38:31,979
prevent the AI from basically replacing
 

8861
02:38:31,979 --> 02:38:35,210
prevent the AI from basically replacing
all human prompt Engineers well there's

8862
02:38:35,210 --> 02:38:35,220
all human prompt Engineers well there's
 

8863
02:38:35,220 --> 02:38:37,550
all human prompt Engineers well there's
it's like a self like where nobody's the

8864
02:38:37,550 --> 02:38:37,560
it's like a self like where nobody's the
 

8865
02:38:37,560 --> 02:38:39,349
it's like a self like where nobody's the
proper engineer anymore so autonomy

8866
02:38:39,349 --> 02:38:39,359
proper engineer anymore so autonomy
 

8867
02:38:39,359 --> 02:38:41,030
proper engineer anymore so autonomy
greater and greater autonomy until it's

8868
02:38:41,030 --> 02:38:41,040
greater and greater autonomy until it's
 

8869
02:38:41,040 --> 02:38:43,010
greater and greater autonomy until it's
full autonomy yeah

8870
02:38:43,010 --> 02:38:43,020
full autonomy yeah
 

8871
02:38:43,020 --> 02:38:44,870
full autonomy yeah
and that's just where it's headed

8872
02:38:44,870 --> 02:38:44,880
and that's just where it's headed
 

8873
02:38:44,880 --> 02:38:47,030
and that's just where it's headed
because one person is going to say

8874
02:38:47,030 --> 02:38:47,040
because one person is going to say
 

8875
02:38:47,040 --> 02:38:51,889
because one person is going to say
run everything for me you see

8876
02:38:51,889 --> 02:38:51,899
run everything for me you see
 

8877
02:38:51,899 --> 02:38:55,010
run everything for me you see
I look at potential Futures and as long

8878
02:38:55,010 --> 02:38:55,020
I look at potential Futures and as long
 

8879
02:38:55,020 --> 02:38:59,349
I look at potential Futures and as long
as the AIS go on to create a vibrant

8880
02:38:59,349 --> 02:38:59,359
as the AIS go on to create a vibrant
 

8881
02:38:59,359 --> 02:39:02,090
as the AIS go on to create a vibrant
civilization with diversity and

8882
02:39:02,090 --> 02:39:02,100
civilization with diversity and
 

8883
02:39:02,100 --> 02:39:04,790
civilization with diversity and
complexity Across the Universe

8884
02:39:04,790 --> 02:39:04,800
complexity Across the Universe
 

8885
02:39:04,800 --> 02:39:07,190
complexity Across the Universe
more power to them I'll die

8886
02:39:07,190 --> 02:39:07,200
more power to them I'll die
 

8887
02:39:07,200 --> 02:39:09,290
more power to them I'll die
um if the AIS go on to actually like

8888
02:39:09,290 --> 02:39:09,300
um if the AIS go on to actually like
 

8889
02:39:09,300 --> 02:39:10,849
um if the AIS go on to actually like
turn the world into paper clips and then

8890
02:39:10,849 --> 02:39:10,859
turn the world into paper clips and then
 

8891
02:39:10,859 --> 02:39:12,410
turn the world into paper clips and then
they die out themselves well that's

8892
02:39:12,410 --> 02:39:12,420
they die out themselves well that's
 

8893
02:39:12,420 --> 02:39:13,610
they die out themselves well that's
horrific and we don't want that to

8894
02:39:13,610 --> 02:39:13,620
horrific and we don't want that to
 

8895
02:39:13,620 --> 02:39:14,330
horrific and we don't want that to
happen

8896
02:39:14,330 --> 02:39:14,340
happen
 

8897
02:39:14,340 --> 02:39:16,130
happen
so this is what I mean about like

8898
02:39:16,130 --> 02:39:16,140
so this is what I mean about like
 

8899
02:39:16,140 --> 02:39:19,250
so this is what I mean about like
robustness I trust robust machines

8900
02:39:19,250 --> 02:39:19,260
robustness I trust robust machines
 

8901
02:39:19,260 --> 02:39:21,410
robustness I trust robust machines
current AIS are so not robust like this

8902
02:39:21,410 --> 02:39:21,420
current AIS are so not robust like this
 

8903
02:39:21,420 --> 02:39:22,550
current AIS are so not robust like this
comes back to the idea that we've never

8904
02:39:22,550 --> 02:39:22,560
comes back to the idea that we've never
 

8905
02:39:22,560 --> 02:39:24,650
comes back to the idea that we've never
made a machine that can self-replicate

8906
02:39:24,650 --> 02:39:24,660
made a machine that can self-replicate
 

8907
02:39:24,660 --> 02:39:27,050
made a machine that can self-replicate
okay but when we have if the machines

8908
02:39:27,050 --> 02:39:27,060
okay but when we have if the machines
 

8909
02:39:27,060 --> 02:39:29,630
okay but when we have if the machines
are truly robust and there is one prompt

8910
02:39:29,630 --> 02:39:29,640
are truly robust and there is one prompt
 

8911
02:39:29,640 --> 02:39:33,050
are truly robust and there is one prompt
engineer left in the world

8912
02:39:33,050 --> 02:39:33,060

 

8913
02:39:33,060 --> 02:39:34,429

hope you're doing good man hope you

8914
02:39:34,429 --> 02:39:34,439
hope you're doing good man hope you
 

8915
02:39:34,439 --> 02:39:36,770
hope you're doing good man hope you
believe in God like you know

8916
02:39:36,770 --> 02:39:36,780
believe in God like you know
 

8917
02:39:36,780 --> 02:39:39,770

you know it just go by God and
go go forth and and uh conquer the

8920
02:39:42,290 --> 02:39:42,300
go go forth and and uh conquer the
 

8921
02:39:42,300 --> 02:39:44,150
go go forth and and uh conquer the
universe well you mentioned uh because I

8922
02:39:44,150 --> 02:39:44,160
universe well you mentioned uh because I
 

8923
02:39:44,160 --> 02:39:46,309
universe well you mentioned uh because I
talked to Mark about faith and God and

8924
02:39:46,309 --> 02:39:46,319
talked to Mark about faith and God and
 

8925
02:39:46,319 --> 02:39:48,590
talked to Mark about faith and God and
you said you were impressed by that

8926
02:39:48,590 --> 02:39:48,600
you said you were impressed by that
 

8927
02:39:48,600 --> 02:39:50,570
you said you were impressed by that
um what's your own belief in God and how

8928
02:39:50,570 --> 02:39:50,580
um what's your own belief in God and how
 

8929
02:39:50,580 --> 02:39:52,490
um what's your own belief in God and how
does that affect your work

8930
02:39:52,490 --> 02:39:52,500
does that affect your work
 

8931
02:39:52,500 --> 02:39:54,230
does that affect your work
you know

8932
02:39:54,230 --> 02:39:54,240
you know
 

8933
02:39:54,240 --> 02:39:55,849
you know
I never really considered when I was

8934
02:39:55,849 --> 02:39:55,859
I never really considered when I was
 

8935
02:39:55,859 --> 02:39:57,349
I never really considered when I was
younger I guess my parents were atheist

8936
02:39:57,349 --> 02:39:57,359
younger I guess my parents were atheist
 

8937
02:39:57,359 --> 02:39:58,490
younger I guess my parents were atheist
so I was right it's kind of atheist and

8938
02:39:58,490 --> 02:39:58,500
so I was right it's kind of atheist and
 

8939
02:39:58,500 --> 02:39:59,630
so I was right it's kind of atheist and
I never really considered how absolutely

8940
02:39:59,630 --> 02:39:59,640
I never really considered how absolutely
 

8941
02:39:59,640 --> 02:40:02,929
I never really considered how absolutely
like silly atheism is because like

8942
02:40:02,929 --> 02:40:02,939
like silly atheism is because like
 

8943
02:40:02,939 --> 02:40:05,929
like silly atheism is because like
I create worlds right every like game

8944
02:40:05,929 --> 02:40:05,939
I create worlds right every like game
 

8945
02:40:05,939 --> 02:40:07,670
I create worlds right every like game
creator like how are you an atheist bro

8946
02:40:07,670 --> 02:40:07,680
creator like how are you an atheist bro
 

8947
02:40:07,680 --> 02:40:10,490
creator like how are you an atheist bro
if you create worlds together but no one

8948
02:40:10,490 --> 02:40:10,500
if you create worlds together but no one
 

8949
02:40:10,500 --> 02:40:11,750
if you create worlds together but no one
created our world man that's different

8950
02:40:11,750 --> 02:40:11,760
created our world man that's different
 

8951
02:40:11,760 --> 02:40:12,950
created our world man that's different
have you heard about like the big bang

8952
02:40:12,950 --> 02:40:12,960
have you heard about like the big bang
 

8953
02:40:12,960 --> 02:40:14,809
have you heard about like the big bang
and stuff yeah I mean what's the Skyrim

8954
02:40:14,809 --> 02:40:14,819
and stuff yeah I mean what's the Skyrim
 

8955
02:40:14,819 --> 02:40:17,210
and stuff yeah I mean what's the Skyrim
myth origin story in Skyrim

8956
02:40:17,210 --> 02:40:17,220
myth origin story in Skyrim
 

8957
02:40:17,220 --> 02:40:18,889
myth origin story in Skyrim
I'm sure there's like some part of it in

8958
02:40:18,889 --> 02:40:18,899
I'm sure there's like some part of it in
 

8959

8990
02:40:53,090 --> 02:40:53,100
it uh it's silly not to conceive that
 

8991
02:40:53,100 --> 02:40:54,469

or there's balance like somebody figured

9012
02:41:16,309 --> 02:41:16,319
or there's balance like somebody figured
 

9013
02:41:16,319 --> 02:41:17,870
or there's balance like somebody figured
out a balanced

9014
02:41:17,870 --> 02:41:17,880
out a balanced
 

9015
02:41:17,880 --> 02:41:20,690
out a balanced
view of it like how to like so it's it

9016
02:41:20,690 --> 02:41:20,700
view of it like how to like so it's it
 

9017
02:41:20,700 --> 02:41:22,429
view of it like how to like so it's it
all makes sense in the end

9018
02:41:22,429 --> 02:41:22,439

I like
but it's a gamified version of life but

much intelligence camera how many flops

9184
02:44:35,090 --> 02:44:35,100
much intelligence camera how many flops
 

9185
02:44:35,100 --> 02:44:37,429
much intelligence camera how many flops
did you have right but now when I'm

9186

but one of the problems that we're

9746
02:54:41,510 --> 02:54:41,520
but one of the problems that we're
 

9747
02:54:41,520 --> 02:54:44,570
but one of the problems that we're
running into is that the comma 3 has

9748
02:54:44,570 --> 02:54:44,580
running into is that the comma 3 has
 

9749
02:54:44,580 --> 02:54:47,090
running into is that the comma 3 has
about as much intelligence as a b

9750
02:54:47,090 --> 02:54:47,100
about as much intelligence as a b
 

9751
02:54:47,100 --> 02:54:48,950
about as much intelligence as a b

9769
02:55:04,800 --> 02:55:06,889
you put your tiny box or your tiny Rack
in your house and then you get your

9770
02:55:06,889 --> 02:55:06,899
in your house and then you get your
 

9771
02:55:06,899 --> 02:55:08,929
in your house and then you get your
comma body and your comma body runs the

9772
02:55:08,929 --> 02:55:08,939
comma body and your comma body runs the
 

9773
02:55:08,939 --> 02:55:10,130

9787
02:55:22,560 --> 02:55:25,730
will have like a central Hub in the home
I mean eventually if you fast forward 20

9788
02:55:25,730 --> 02:55:25,740
I mean eventually if you fast forward 20

enough to run these AIS yeah but

9792
02:55:29,750 --> 02:55:29,760
enough to run these AIS yeah but
 

9793
02:55:29,760 --> 02:55:31,130
enough to run these AIS yeah but
fundamentally it's not even a question

9794
02:55:31,130 --> 02:55:31,140
fundamentally it's not even a question
 

9795
02:55:31,140 --> 02:55:33,950
fundamentally it's not even a question
of putting legs on a tiny box because

9796
02:55:33,950 --> 02:55:33,960
of putting legs on a tiny box because
 

9797
02:55:33,960 --> 02:55:35,870

how are you getting 1.5 kilowatts of
 

9799
02:55:35,880 --> 02:55:38,570
how are you getting 1.5 kilowatts of
power on that thing right yeah so you

9800
02:55:38,570 --> 02:55:38,580
power on that thing right yeah so you
 

9801
02:55:38,580 --> 02:55:40,849
power on that thing right yeah so you
you need they're very uh synergistic

9802
02:55:40,849 --> 02:55:40,859
you need they're very uh synergistic

use commodity Parts I think I can do it

9810
02:55:49,610 --> 02:55:49,620
use commodity Parts I think I can do it
 

9811
02:55:49,620 --> 02:55:50,570
use commodity Parts I think I can do it
cheaper

ran with and ended up writing this so
 

9873
02:57:06,180 --> 02:57:08,630
ran with and ended up writing this so
you know but I mean to me that don't go

side to me is that the fact that he's
 

9879
02:57:13,920 --> 02:57:16,550
side to me is that the fact that he's
going there is a good sign

you give me a look
 

9909
02:57:50,479 --> 02:57:52,550
you give me a look
give me a look no I think I think a

factor altruism is a terribly evil

9912
02:57:54,349 --> 02:57:54,359
factor altruism is a terribly evil
 

9913
02:57:54,359 --> 02:57:56,030
factor altruism is a terribly evil
ideology and yeah oh yeah that's

9914
02:57:56,030 --> 02:57:56,040
ideology and yeah oh yeah that's
 

9915
02:57:56,040 --> 02:57:57,469
ideology and yeah oh yeah that's
interesting why do you think that is why

9916
02:57:57,469 --> 02:57:57,479
interesting why do you think that is why
 

9917
02:57:57,479 --> 02:58:00,290
interesting why do you think that is why
do you think there's something about a

9918
02:58:00,290 --> 02:58:00,300
do you think there's something about a
 

9919
02:58:00,300 --> 02:58:02,330
do you think there's something about a
thing that sounds pretty good

9920
02:58:02,330 --> 02:58:02,340
thing that sounds pretty good
 

9921
02:58:02,340 --> 02:58:03,950
thing that sounds pretty good
that kind of gets us into trouble

9922
02:58:03,950 --> 02:58:03,960
that kind of gets us into trouble
 

9923
02:58:03,960 --> 02:58:06,410
that kind of gets us into trouble
because you get sandbagment freed like

9924
02:58:06,410 --> 02:58:06,420
because you get sandbagment freed like
 

9925
02:58:06,420 --> 02:58:08,090
because you get sandbagment freed like
sambang and freed is the embodiment of

9926
02:58:08,090 --> 02:58:08,100
sambang and freed is the embodiment of
 

9927
02:58:08,100 --> 02:58:10,809
sambang and freed is the embodiment of
effective altruism

9928
02:58:10,809 --> 02:58:10,819
effective altruism
 

9929
02:58:10,819 --> 02:58:13,090
effective altruism
utilitarianism is an abhorrent ideology

9930
02:58:13,090 --> 02:58:13,100
utilitarianism is an abhorrent ideology
 

9931
02:58:13,100 --> 02:58:15,530
utilitarianism is an abhorrent ideology
like like well yeah we're gonna kill

9932
02:58:15,530 --> 02:58:15,540
like like well yeah we're gonna kill
 

9933
02:58:15,540 --> 02:58:17,090
like like well yeah we're gonna kill
those three people to save a thousand of

9934
02:58:17,090 --> 02:58:17,100
those three people to save a thousand of
 

9935
02:58:17,100 --> 02:58:19,190
those three people to save a thousand of
course yeah right there's no there's no

9936
02:58:19,190 --> 02:58:19,200
course yeah right there's no there's no
 

9937
02:58:19,200 --> 02:58:23,090
course yeah right there's no there's no
underlying like there's just yeah

9938
02:58:23,090 --> 02:58:23,100
underlying like there's just yeah
 

9939
02:58:23,100 --> 02:58:26,450
underlying like there's just yeah
yeah but to me that's a bit surprising

9940
02:58:26,450 --> 02:58:26,460
yeah but to me that's a bit surprising
 

9941
02:58:26,460 --> 02:58:28,429
yeah but to me that's a bit surprising
but it's also

9942
02:58:28,429 --> 02:58:28,439
but it's also
 

9943
02:58:28,439 --> 02:58:31,250
but it's also
in retrospect not that surprising but I

9944
02:58:31,250 --> 02:58:31,260
in retrospect not that surprising but I
 

9945
02:58:31,260 --> 02:58:34,690
in retrospect not that surprising but I
haven't heard really clear kind of

9946
02:58:34,690 --> 02:58:34,700
haven't heard really clear kind of
 

9947
02:58:34,700 --> 02:58:38,389
haven't heard really clear kind of
uh like rigorous analysis why effective

9948
02:58:38,389 --> 02:58:38,399
uh like rigorous analysis why effective
 

9949
02:58:38,399 --> 02:58:41,330
uh like rigorous analysis why effective
altruism is flawed oh well I think

9950
02:58:41,330 --> 02:58:41,340
altruism is flawed oh well I think
 

9951
02:58:41,340 --> 02:58:43,309
altruism is flawed oh well I think
charity is bad right so what is Charity

9952
02:58:43,309 --> 02:58:43,319
charity is bad right so what is Charity
 

9953
02:58:43,319 --> 02:58:44,510
charity is bad right so what is Charity
but investment that you don't expect to

9954
02:58:44,510 --> 02:58:44,520
but investment that you don't expect to
 

9955
02:58:44,520 --> 02:58:47,330
but investment that you don't expect to
have a return on right

9956
02:58:47,330 --> 02:58:47,340
have a return on right
 

9957
02:58:47,340 --> 02:58:49,370
have a return on right
yeah but you can also think of Charity

9958
02:58:49,370 --> 02:58:49,380
yeah but you can also think of Charity
 

9959
02:58:49,380 --> 02:58:51,530
yeah but you can also think of Charity
as like um

9960
02:58:51,530 --> 02:58:51,540
as like um
 

9961
02:58:51,540 --> 02:58:53,750
as like um
is you would like to see

9962
02:58:53,750 --> 02:58:53,760
is you would like to see
 

9963
02:58:53,760 --> 02:58:56,389
is you would like to see
uh so allocate resources in an optimal

9964
02:58:56,389 --> 02:58:56,399
uh so allocate resources in an optimal
 

9965
02:58:56,399 --> 02:58:57,469
uh so allocate resources in an optimal
way

9966
02:58:57,469 --> 02:58:57,479
way
 

9967
02:58:57,479 --> 02:59:00,410
way
to uh to make a better world and

9968
02:59:00,410 --> 02:59:00,420
to uh to make a better world and
 

9969
02:59:00,420 --> 02:59:02,150
to uh to make a better world and
probably almost always that involves

9970
02:59:02,150 --> 02:59:02,160
probably almost always that involves
 

9971
02:59:02,160 --> 02:59:04,130
probably almost always that involves
starting a company yeah right because

9972
02:59:04,130 --> 02:59:04,140
starting a company yeah right because
 

9973
02:59:04,140 --> 02:59:06,170
starting a company yeah right because
more efficient yeah if you just take the

9974
02:59:06,170 --> 02:59:06,180
more efficient yeah if you just take the
 

9975
02:59:06,180 --> 02:59:08,450
more efficient yeah if you just take the
money and you spend it on malaria Nets

9976
02:59:08,450 --> 02:59:08,460
money and you spend it on malaria Nets
 

9977
02:59:08,460 --> 02:59:10,910
money and you spend it on malaria Nets
you know okay great you've made 100

9978
02:59:10,910 --> 02:59:10,920
you know okay great you've made 100
 

9979
02:59:10,920 --> 02:59:14,150
you know okay great you've made 100
malaria Nets but if you teach yeah male

9980
02:59:14,150 --> 02:59:14,160
malaria Nets but if you teach yeah male
 

9981
02:59:14,160 --> 02:59:15,830
malaria Nets but if you teach yeah male
how to fish right yeah no but the

9982
02:59:15,830 --> 02:59:15,840
how to fish right yeah no but the
 

9983
02:59:15,840 --> 02:59:17,510
how to fish right yeah no but the
problem is uh teaching a matter how

9984
02:59:17,510 --> 02:59:17,520
problem is uh teaching a matter how
 

9985
02:59:17,520 --> 02:59:18,830
problem is uh teaching a matter how
efficient might be harder starting a

9986
02:59:18,830 --> 02:59:18,840
efficient might be harder starting a
 

9987
02:59:18,840 --> 02:59:20,929
efficient might be harder starting a
company might be harder than allocating

9988
02:59:20,929 --> 02:59:20,939
company might be harder than allocating
 

9989
02:59:20,939 --> 02:59:22,790
company might be harder than allocating
money that you already have I like the

9990

money that you already have I like the
 

9991
02:59:22,800 --> 02:59:24,710

flip side of effect of altruism effect

9992
02:59:24,710 --> 02:59:24,720
flip side of effect of altruism effect
 

9993
02:59:24,720 --> 02:59:26,269
flip side of effect of altruism effect
of accelerationism I think

9994
02:59:26,269 --> 02:59:26,279
of accelerationism I think
 

9995
02:59:26,279 --> 02:59:27,830
of accelerationism I think
accelerationism is the only thing that's

9996
02:59:27,830 --> 02:59:27,840
accelerationism is the only thing that's
 

9997
02:59:27,840 --> 02:59:30,170
accelerationism is the only thing that's
ever lifted people out of poverty

9998
02:59:30,170 --> 02:59:30,180
ever lifted people out of poverty
 

9999
02:59:30,180 --> 02:59:32,990
ever lifted people out of poverty
um the fact that food is cheap not we're

10000
02:59:32,990 --> 02:59:33,000
um the fact that food is cheap not we're
 

10001
02:59:33,000 --> 02:59:34,429
um the fact that food is cheap not we're
giving food away because we are

10002
02:59:34,429 --> 02:59:34,439
giving food away because we are
 

10003

Ubi to survive and I mean it

10022
03:00:04,309 --> 03:00:04,319

 

10023
03:00:04,319 --> 03:00:06,230

what if survival is basically guaranteed

10024
03:00:06,230 --> 03:00:06,240
what if survival is basically guaranteed
 

10025
03:00:06,240 --> 03:00:09,349
what if survival is basically guaranteed
what if our life becomes so good

what if our life becomes so good
 

10027
03:00:09,359 --> 03:00:12,230
what if our life becomes so good
make survival guaranteed without Ubi

10028
03:00:12,230 --> 03:00:12,240
make survival guaranteed without Ubi
 

10029

that's naive yeah I believe in the power
of these language models satya's alive

it's great it's great I like all the

10330
03:05:49,190 --> 03:05:49,200
it's great it's great I like all the
 

10331
03:05:49,200 --> 03:05:50,809
it's great it's great I like all the
innovation in these companies they're

10332
03:05:50,809 --> 03:05:50,819
innovation in these companies they're
 

10333
03:05:50,819 --> 03:05:52,090
innovation in these companies they're
not being stale

10334
03:05:52,090 --> 03:05:52,100
not being stale
 

10335
03:05:52,100 --> 03:05:54,290
not being stale
uh and to the degree they're being stale

10336
03:05:54,290 --> 03:05:54,300
uh and to the degree they're being stale
 

10337
03:05:54,300 --> 03:05:56,330
uh and to the degree they're being stale
they're losing so there's a huge

10338
03:05:56,330 --> 03:05:56,340
they're losing so there's a huge
 

10339
03:05:56,340 --> 03:05:57,950
they're losing so there's a huge

and open source work which is this is
 

10343
03:06:00,359 --> 03:06:02,510
and open source work which is this is
incredible only way to win

10344
03:06:02,510 --> 03:06:02,520
