171
00:02:43,840 --> 00:02:46,150
i've spent the last 10 years or more
trying to do experiments it turns out to

172
00:02:46,150 --> 00:02:46,160
trying to do experiments it turns out to
 

173
00:02:46,160 --> 00:02:47,589
trying to do experiments it turns out to
be difficult of course everything's more

174
00:02:47,589 --> 00:02:47,599
be difficult of course everything's more
 

175
00:02:47,599 --> 00:02:48,630
be difficult of course everything's more
difficult than you ever thought it was

176
00:02:48,630 --> 00:02:48,640
difficult than you ever thought it was
 

177
00:02:48,640 --> 00:02:49,589
difficult than you ever thought it was
going to be

178
00:02:49,589 --> 00:02:49,599
going to be
 

179
00:02:49,599 --> 00:02:51,589
going to be
but it looks i would say more true

180
00:02:51,589 --> 00:02:51,599
but it looks i would say more true
 

181
00:02:51,599 --> 00:02:53,430
but it looks i would say more true
rather than less true over that 10-year

182
00:02:53,430 --> 00:02:53,440
rather than less true over that 10-year
 

183
00:02:53,440 --> 00:02:55,350
rather than less true over that 10-year
period i think i have to take a step

184
00:02:55,350 --> 00:02:55,360
period i think i have to take a step
 

185
00:02:55,360 --> 00:02:56,710
period i think i have to take a step
back every now and then and think hang

186
00:02:56,710 --> 00:02:56,720
back every now and then and think hang
 

187
00:02:56,720 --> 00:02:59,270
back every now and then and think hang
on a minute where's this going uh i'm

188
00:02:59,270 --> 00:02:59,280
on a minute where's this going uh i'm
 

189
00:02:59,280 --> 00:03:02,070
on a minute where's this going uh i'm
happy it's going in a sensible direction

190
00:03:02,070 --> 00:03:02,080
happy it's going in a sensible direction
 

191
00:03:02,080 --> 00:03:05,509
happy it's going in a sensible direction
and i think then you have these other

192
00:03:05,509 --> 00:03:05,519
and i think then you have these other
 

193
00:03:05,519 --> 00:03:07,190
and i think then you have these other
interesting dilemmas i mean i'm often

194
00:03:07,190 --> 00:03:07,200
interesting dilemmas i mean i'm often
 

195
00:03:07,200 --> 00:03:09,670
interesting dilemmas i mean i'm often
accused of being

196
00:03:09,670 --> 00:03:09,680
accused of being
 

197
00:03:09,680 --> 00:03:11,990
accused of being
too focused on life on earth

198
00:03:11,990 --> 00:03:12,000
too focused on life on earth
 

199
00:03:12,000 --> 00:03:13,990
too focused on life on earth
too kind of

200
00:03:13,990 --> 00:03:14,000
too kind of
 

201
00:03:14,000 --> 00:03:15,670
too kind of
narrow-minded and inward looking you

202
00:03:15,670 --> 00:03:15,680
narrow-minded and inward looking you
 

203
00:03:15,680 --> 00:03:17,430
narrow-minded and inward looking you
might say i'm think i'm talking about

204
00:03:17,430 --> 00:03:17,440
might say i'm think i'm talking about
 

205
00:03:17,440 --> 00:03:19,670
might say i'm think i'm talking about
carbon i'm talking about cells and maybe

206
00:03:19,670 --> 00:03:19,680
carbon i'm talking about cells and maybe
 

207
00:03:19,680 --> 00:03:21,750
carbon i'm talking about cells and maybe
you or plenty of people can say to me ah

208
00:03:21,750 --> 00:03:21,760
you or plenty of people can say to me ah
 

209
00:03:21,760 --> 00:03:23,430
you or plenty of people can say to me ah
yeah but life can be anything i have no

210
00:03:23,430 --> 00:03:23,440
yeah but life can be anything i have no
 

211
00:03:23,440 --> 00:03:27,270
yeah but life can be anything i have no
imagination and maybe they're right but

212
00:03:27,270 --> 00:03:27,280
imagination and maybe they're right but
 

213
00:03:27,280 --> 00:03:29,350
imagination and maybe they're right but
unless we can say why life here is this

214
00:03:29,350 --> 00:03:29,360
unless we can say why life here is this
 

215
00:03:29,360 --> 00:03:31,350
unless we can say why life here is this
way and if those reasons are fundamental

216
00:03:31,350 --> 00:03:31,360
way and if those reasons are fundamental
 

217
00:03:31,360 --> 00:03:32,869
way and if those reasons are fundamental
reasons or if they're just trivial

218
00:03:32,869 --> 00:03:32,879
reasons or if they're just trivial
 

219
00:03:32,879 --> 00:03:34,630
reasons or if they're just trivial
reasons then we can't answer that

220
00:03:34,630 --> 00:03:34,640
reasons then we can't answer that
 

221
00:03:34,640 --> 00:03:37,509
reasons then we can't answer that
question um so so i think they're

222
00:03:37,509 --> 00:03:37,519
question um so so i think they're
 

223
00:03:37,519 --> 00:03:39,350
question um so so i think they're
fundamental reasons and i think we need

224
00:03:39,350 --> 00:03:39,360
fundamental reasons and i think we need
 

225
00:03:39,360 --> 00:03:40,789
fundamental reasons and i think we need
to worry about them yeah there might be

226
00:03:40,789 --> 00:03:40,799
to worry about them yeah there might be
 

227
00:03:40,799 --> 00:03:42,789
to worry about them yeah there might be
some deep truth to the puzzle here on

228
00:03:42,789 --> 00:03:42,799
some deep truth to the puzzle here on
 

229
00:03:42,799 --> 00:03:45,190
some deep truth to the puzzle here on
earth that will resonate with

230
00:03:45,190 --> 00:03:45,200
earth that will resonate with
 

231
00:03:45,200 --> 00:03:48,470
earth that will resonate with
other puzzles elsewhere that will

00:03:53,589 --> 00:03:53,599
us that deeper truth so what to this
 

237
00:03:53,599 --> 00:03:55,350
us that deeper truth so what to this
puzzle you said

238
00:03:55,350 --> 00:03:55,360
puzzle you said
 

239
00:03:55,360 --> 00:03:56,949
puzzle you said
vents

240
00:03:56,949 --> 00:03:56,959
vents
 

241
00:03:56,959 --> 00:03:58,830
vents
hydrogen

242
00:03:58,830 --> 00:03:58,840
hydrogen
 

243
00:03:58,840 --> 00:04:01,030
hydrogen
wet so

244
00:04:01,030 --> 00:04:01,040
wet so
 

245
00:04:01,040 --> 00:04:04,550
wet so
chemically what is the potion here how

246
00:04:04,550 --> 00:04:04,560
chemically what is the potion here how
 

247
00:04:04,560 --> 00:04:06,390
chemically what is the potion here how
important is oxygen you wrote a book

248
00:04:06,390 --> 00:04:06,400
important is oxygen you wrote a book
 

249
00:04:06,400 --> 00:04:08,789
important is oxygen you wrote a book
about this yeah and i actually just came

250
00:04:08,789 --> 00:04:08,799
about this yeah and i actually just came
 

251
00:04:08,799 --> 00:04:10,070
about this yeah and i actually just came
straight here from a conference where i

252
00:04:10,070 --> 00:04:10,080
straight here from a conference where i
 

253
00:04:10,080 --> 00:04:12,070
straight here from a conference where i
was sharing a session on whether oxygen

254
00:04:12,070 --> 00:04:12,080
was sharing a session on whether oxygen
 

255
00:04:12,080 --> 00:04:13,750
was sharing a session on whether oxygen
matters or not in the history of life of

256
00:04:13,750 --> 00:04:13,760
matters or not in the history of life of
 

257
00:04:13,760 --> 00:04:15,190
matters or not in the history of life of
course it matters

258
00:04:15,190 --> 00:04:15,200
course it matters
 

259
00:04:15,200 --> 00:04:16,949
course it matters
but it matters most of the origin of

260
00:04:16,949 --> 00:04:16,959
but it matters most of the origin of
 

261
00:04:16,959 --> 00:04:19,990
but it matters most of the origin of
life to be not there um

262
00:04:19,990 --> 00:04:20,000
life to be not there um
 

263
00:04:20,000 --> 00:04:22,310
life to be not there um
as i see it we have this

264
00:04:22,310 --> 00:04:22,320
as i see it we have this
 

265
00:04:22,320 --> 00:04:25,270
as i see it we have this
i mean life is made of carbon basically

266
00:04:25,270 --> 00:04:25,280
i mean life is made of carbon basically
 

267
00:04:25,280 --> 00:04:28,310
i mean life is made of carbon basically
primarily um organic molecules with

268
00:04:28,310 --> 00:04:28,320
primarily um organic molecules with
 

269
00:04:28,320 --> 00:04:30,150
primarily um organic molecules with
carbon-carbon bonds

270
00:04:30,150 --> 00:04:30,160
carbon-carbon bonds
 

271
00:04:30,160 --> 00:04:31,270
carbon-carbon bonds
and

272
00:04:31,270 --> 00:04:31,280
and
 

273
00:04:31,280 --> 00:04:32,870
and
the building block the lego brick that

274
00:04:32,870 --> 00:04:32,880
the building block the lego brick that
 

275
00:04:32,880 --> 00:04:34,390
the building block the lego brick that
we take out of the air or take out of

276
00:04:34,390 --> 00:04:34,400
we take out of the air or take out of
 

277
00:04:34,400 --> 00:04:37,590
we take out of the air or take out of
the oceans is carbon dioxide and to turn

278
00:04:37,590 --> 00:04:37,600
the oceans is carbon dioxide and to turn
 

279
00:04:37,600 --> 00:04:39,590
the oceans is carbon dioxide and to turn
carbon dioxide into organic molecules we

280
00:04:39,590 --> 00:04:39,600
carbon dioxide into organic molecules we
 

281
00:04:39,600 --> 00:04:42,629
carbon dioxide into organic molecules we
need to strap on hydrogen and so we need

282
00:04:42,629 --> 00:04:42,639
need to strap on hydrogen and so we need
 

283
00:04:42,639 --> 00:04:44,550
need to strap on hydrogen and so we need
an and this is basically what life

284
00:04:44,550 --> 00:04:44,560
an and this is basically what life
 

285
00:04:44,560 --> 00:04:46,710
an and this is basically what life
is doing it's hydrogenating carbon

286
00:04:46,710 --> 00:04:46,720
is doing it's hydrogenating carbon
 

287
00:04:46,720 --> 00:04:48,390
is doing it's hydrogenating carbon
dioxide it's taking the hydrogen the

288
00:04:48,390 --> 00:04:48,400
dioxide it's taking the hydrogen the
 

289
00:04:48,400 --> 00:04:49,510
dioxide it's taking the hydrogen the
bubbles out of the earth in these

290
00:04:49,510 --> 00:04:49,520
bubbles out of the earth in these
 

291
00:04:49,520 --> 00:04:51,670
bubbles out of the earth in these
hydrothermal vents and it sticks it on

292
00:04:51,670 --> 00:04:51,680
hydrothermal vents and it sticks it on
 

293
00:04:51,680 --> 00:04:52,870
hydrothermal vents and it sticks it on
co2

294
00:04:52,870 --> 00:04:52,880
co2
 

295
00:04:52,880 --> 00:04:54,710
co2
um and it's kind of really as simple as

296
00:04:54,710 --> 00:04:54,720
um and it's kind of really as simple as
 

297
00:04:54,720 --> 00:04:57,990
um and it's kind of really as simple as
that um and actually thermodynamically

298
00:04:57,990 --> 00:04:58,000
that um and actually thermodynamically
 

299
00:04:58,000 --> 00:04:59,990
that um and actually thermodynamically
there's the the thing that i find most

300
00:04:59,990 --> 00:05:00,000
there's the the thing that i find most
 

301
00:05:00,000 --> 00:05:00,950
there's the the thing that i find most
troubling

302
00:05:00,950 --> 00:05:00,960
troubling
 

303
00:05:00,960 --> 00:05:03,270
troubling
is that you if you do these experiments

304
00:05:03,270 --> 00:05:03,280
is that you if you do these experiments
 

305
00:05:03,280 --> 00:05:04,870
is that you if you do these experiments
in the lab the molecules you get are

306
00:05:04,870 --> 00:05:04,880
in the lab the molecules you get are
 

307
00:05:04,880 --> 00:05:06,550
in the lab the molecules you get are
exactly the molecules that we see at the

308
00:05:06,550 --> 00:05:06,560
exactly the molecules that we see at the
 

309
00:05:06,560 --> 00:05:08,830
exactly the molecules that we see at the
heart of biochemistry in the heart of

310
00:05:08,830 --> 00:05:08,840
heart of biochemistry in the heart of
 

311
00:05:08,840 --> 00:05:12,469
heart of biochemistry in the heart of
life is there something to be said about

312
00:05:12,469 --> 00:05:12,479
life is there something to be said about
 

313
00:05:12,479 --> 00:05:15,189
life is there something to be said about
the earliest origins of that

314
00:05:15,189 --> 00:05:15,199
the earliest origins of that
 

315
00:05:15,199 --> 00:05:17,590
the earliest origins of that
little uh

316
00:05:17,590 --> 00:05:17,600
little uh
 

317
00:05:17,600 --> 00:05:18,790
little uh
potion

318
00:05:18,790 --> 00:05:18,800
potion
 

319
00:05:18,800 --> 00:05:21,350
potion
that chemical process

320
00:05:21,350 --> 00:05:21,360
that chemical process
 

321
00:05:21,360 --> 00:05:24,550
that chemical process
what really is the spark there

322
00:05:24,550 --> 00:05:24,560
what really is the spark there
 

323
00:05:24,560 --> 00:05:25,990
what really is the spark there
there isn't

324
00:05:25,990 --> 00:05:26,000
there isn't
 

325
00:05:26,000 --> 00:05:28,230
there isn't
a spark um

326
00:05:28,230 --> 00:05:28,240
a spark um
 

327
00:05:28,240 --> 00:05:31,350
a spark um
there is a continuous chemical reaction

328
00:05:31,350 --> 00:05:31,360
there is a continuous chemical reaction
 

329
00:05:31,360 --> 00:05:33,350
there is a continuous chemical reaction
and there is kind of a spark but it's a

330
00:05:33,350 --> 00:05:33,360
and there is kind of a spark but it's a
 

331
00:05:33,360 --> 00:05:35,990
and there is kind of a spark but it's a
continuous electrical charge which helps

332
00:05:35,990 --> 00:05:36,000
continuous electrical charge which helps

so why doesn't that happen is because of

398
00:06:45,990 --> 00:06:46,000
so why doesn't that happen is because of
 

399
00:06:46,000 --> 00:06:47,830
so why doesn't that happen is because of
the kinetic barriers is because that's

the kinetic barriers is because that's
 

401
00:06:47,840 --> 00:06:49,830
the kinetic barriers is because that's

00:08:25,350 --> 00:08:25,360
is
 

497
00:08:25,360 --> 00:08:26,469
is
oxygen

498
00:08:26,469 --> 00:08:26,479
oxygen
 

499
00:08:26,479 --> 00:08:27,510
oxygen
makes it

500
00:08:27,510 --> 00:08:27,520
makes it
 

501
00:08:27,520 --> 00:08:29,909
makes it
impossible really for life to start so

502
00:08:29,909 --> 00:08:29,919
impossible really for life to start so
 

503
00:08:29,919 --> 00:08:31,270
impossible really for life to start so
as soon as we've got oxygen in the

504
00:08:31,270 --> 00:08:31,280
as soon as we've got oxygen in the
 

505
00:08:31,280 --> 00:08:33,110
as soon as we've got oxygen in the
atmosphere then life isn't going to keep

506
00:08:33,110 --> 00:08:33,120
atmosphere then life isn't going to keep
 

507
00:08:33,120 --> 00:08:35,750
atmosphere then life isn't going to keep
starting over so i often get asked by

508
00:08:35,750 --> 00:08:35,760
starting over so i often get asked by
 

509
00:08:35,760 --> 00:08:37,509
starting over so i often get asked by
people you know why can't we have life

510
00:08:37,509 --> 00:08:37,519
people you know why can't we have life
 

511
00:08:37,519 --> 00:08:39,110
people you know why can't we have life
starting if it's so easy why can't i

512
00:08:39,110 --> 00:08:39,120
starting if it's so easy why can't i
 

513
00:08:39,120 --> 00:08:41,029
starting if it's so easy why can't i
start in these vents now and the answer

514
00:08:41,029 --> 00:08:41,039
start in these vents now and the answer
 

515
00:08:41,039 --> 00:08:42,870
start in these vents now and the answer
is you've got if you want hydrogen to

516
00:08:42,870 --> 00:08:42,880
is you've got if you want hydrogen to
 

517
00:08:42,880 --> 00:08:44,310
is you've got if you want hydrogen to
react with co2 and there's oxygen there

518
00:08:44,310 --> 00:08:44,320
react with co2 and there's oxygen there
 

519
00:08:44,320 --> 00:08:46,230
react with co2 and there's oxygen there
hydrogen reacts with oxygen instead it's

520
00:08:46,230 --> 00:08:46,240
hydrogen reacts with oxygen instead it's
 

521
00:08:46,240 --> 00:08:48,070
hydrogen reacts with oxygen instead it's
just you know you you get an explosive

522
00:08:48,070 --> 00:08:48,080
just you know you you get an explosive
 

523
00:08:48,080 --> 00:08:50,150
just you know you you get an explosive
reaction that way it's rocket fuel so

524
00:08:50,150 --> 00:08:50,160
reaction that way it's rocket fuel so
 

525
00:08:50,160 --> 00:08:51,910
reaction that way it's rocket fuel so
it's never going to happen but the other

526
00:08:51,910 --> 00:08:51,920
it's never going to happen but the other
 

527
00:08:51,920 --> 00:08:53,990
it's never going to happen but the other
for the origin of life earlier than that

528
00:08:53,990 --> 00:08:54,000
for the origin of life earlier than that
 

529
00:08:54,000 --> 00:08:55,430
for the origin of life earlier than that
all we know

530
00:08:55,430 --> 00:08:55,440
all we know
 

531
00:08:55,440 --> 00:08:57,190
all we know
is that there's a single common ancestor

532
00:08:57,190 --> 00:08:57,200
is that there's a single common ancestor
 

533
00:08:57,200 --> 00:08:58,870
is that there's a single common ancestor
for all of life there could have been

534
00:08:58,870 --> 00:08:58,880
for all of life there could have been
 

535
00:08:58,880 --> 00:09:00,630
for all of life there could have been
multiple origins and they all just

536
00:09:00,630 --> 00:09:00,640
multiple origins and they all just
 

537
00:09:00,640 --> 00:09:02,870
multiple origins and they all just
disappeared um

538
00:09:02,870 --> 00:09:02,880
disappeared um
 

539
00:09:02,880 --> 00:09:04,790
disappeared um
but there's a very interesting deep

540
00:09:04,790 --> 00:09:04,800
but there's a very interesting deep
 

541
00:09:04,800 --> 00:09:07,829
but there's a very interesting deep
split in life between bacteria and what

542
00:09:07,829 --> 00:09:07,839
split in life between bacteria and what
 

543
00:09:07,839 --> 00:09:09,990
split in life between bacteria and what
are called archaea which look just the

544
00:09:09,990 --> 00:09:10,000
are called archaea which look just the
 

545
00:09:10,000 --> 00:09:12,150
are called archaea which look just the
same as bacteria

546
00:09:12,150 --> 00:09:12,160
same as bacteria
 

547
00:09:12,160 --> 00:09:13,910
same as bacteria
and they're not quite as diverse but

548
00:09:13,910 --> 00:09:13,920
and they're not quite as diverse but
 

549
00:09:13,920 --> 00:09:16,550
and they're not quite as diverse but
nearly and they are very different in

550
00:09:16,550 --> 00:09:16,560
nearly and they are very different in
 

551
00:09:16,560 --> 00:09:18,470
nearly and they are very different in
their biochemistry and so any

552
00:09:18,470 --> 00:09:18,480
their biochemistry and so any
 

553
00:09:18,480 --> 00:09:19,910
their biochemistry and so any
explanation for the origin of life has

554
00:09:19,910 --> 00:09:19,920
explanation for the origin of life has
 

555
00:09:19,920 --> 00:09:22,310
explanation for the origin of life has
to account as well for why they're so

556
00:09:22,310 --> 00:09:22,320
to account as well for why they're so
 

557
00:09:22,320 --> 00:09:25,269
to account as well for why they're so
different and yet so similar and that

558
00:09:25,269 --> 00:09:25,279
different and yet so similar and that
 

559
00:09:25,279 --> 00:09:27,430
different and yet so similar and that
makes me think that life probably did

560
00:09:27,430 --> 00:09:27,440
makes me think that life probably did
 

561
00:09:27,440 --> 00:09:29,030
makes me think that life probably did
arise only once

562
00:09:29,030 --> 00:09:29,040
arise only once
 

563
00:09:29,040 --> 00:09:30,790
arise only once
can you describe the difference that's

564
00:09:30,790 --> 00:09:30,800
can you describe the difference that's
 

565
00:09:30,800 --> 00:09:32,230
can you describe the difference that's
interesting there

566
00:09:32,230 --> 00:09:32,240
interesting there
 

567
00:09:32,240 --> 00:09:33,430
interesting there
how they're similar how they're

568
00:09:33,430 --> 00:09:33,440
how they're similar how they're
 

569
00:09:33,440 --> 00:09:36,550
how they're similar how they're
different well they're different in uh

570
00:09:36,550 --> 00:09:36,560
different well they're different in uh
 

571
00:09:36,560 --> 00:09:38,230
different well they're different in uh
in their membranes primarily they're

572
00:09:38,230 --> 00:09:38,240
in their membranes primarily they're
 

573
00:09:38,240 --> 00:09:40,230
in their membranes primarily they're
different in things like dna replication

574
00:09:40,230 --> 00:09:40,240
different in things like dna replication
 

575
00:09:40,240 --> 00:09:41,750
different in things like dna replication
they use completely different enzymes

576
00:09:41,750 --> 00:09:41,760
they use completely different enzymes
 

577
00:09:41,760 --> 00:09:43,750
they use completely different enzymes
and the genes behind it for replicating

578
00:09:43,750 --> 00:09:43,760
and the genes behind it for replicating
 

579
00:09:43,760 --> 00:09:46,550
and the genes behind it for replicating
dna so they both have membranes both

580
00:09:46,550 --> 00:09:46,560
dna so they both have membranes both
 

581
00:09:46,560 --> 00:09:49,190
dna so they both have membranes both
have dna replication yes the process of

582
00:09:49,190 --> 00:09:49,200
have dna replication yes the process of
 

583
00:09:49,200 --> 00:09:51,350
have dna replication yes the process of
that is different they have d they both

584
00:09:51,350 --> 00:09:51,360
that is different they have d they both
 

585
00:09:51,360 --> 00:09:53,670
that is different they have d they both
have dna the genetic code is identical

586
00:09:53,670 --> 00:09:53,680
have dna the genetic code is identical
 

587
00:09:53,680 --> 00:09:56,630
have dna the genetic code is identical
in them both the way in which it's uh

588
00:09:56,630 --> 00:09:56,640
in them both the way in which it's uh
 

589
00:09:56,640 --> 00:10:00,230
in them both the way in which it's uh
transcribed into rna into the copy of a

590
00:10:00,230 --> 00:10:00,240
transcribed into rna into the copy of a
 

591
00:10:00,240 --> 00:10:01,829
transcribed into rna into the copy of a
gene and the way that that's then

592
00:10:01,829 --> 00:10:01,839
gene and the way that that's then
 

593
00:10:01,839 --> 00:10:03,590
gene and the way that that's then
translated into a protein that's all

594
00:10:03,590 --> 00:10:03,600
translated into a protein that's all
 

595
00:10:03,600 --> 00:10:05,110
translated into a protein that's all
basically the same in both these groups

596
00:10:05,110 --> 00:10:05,120
basically the same in both these groups
 

597
00:10:05,120 --> 00:10:06,949
basically the same in both these groups
so they clearly share

598
00:10:06,949 --> 00:10:06,959
so they clearly share
 

599
00:10:06,959 --> 00:10:09,110
so they clearly share
a common ancestor it's just that they're

600
00:10:09,110 --> 00:10:09,120
a common ancestor it's just that they're
 

601
00:10:09,120 --> 00:10:10,790
a common ancestor it's just that they're
different in fundamental ways as well

602
00:10:10,790 --> 00:10:10,800
different in fundamental ways as well
 

603
00:10:10,800 --> 00:10:13,030
different in fundamental ways as well
and if you think about what kind of

604
00:10:13,030 --> 00:10:13,040
and if you think about what kind of
 

605
00:10:13,040 --> 00:10:15,350
and if you think about what kind of
processes could drive that divergence

606
00:10:15,350 --> 00:10:15,360
processes could drive that divergence
 

607
00:10:15,360 --> 00:10:16,829
processes could drive that divergence
very early on

608
00:10:16,829 --> 00:10:16,839
very early on
 

609
00:10:16,839 --> 00:10:19,110
very early on
um i can think about it in terms of

610
00:10:19,110 --> 00:10:19,120
um i can think about it in terms of
 

611
00:10:19,120 --> 00:10:20,949
um i can think about it in terms of
membranes in terms of the electrical

612
00:10:20,949 --> 00:10:20,959
membranes in terms of the electrical
 

613
00:10:20,959 --> 00:10:23,350
membranes in terms of the electrical
charges on membranes and it's that that

614
00:10:23,350 --> 00:10:23,360
charges on membranes and it's that that
 

615
00:10:23,360 --> 00:10:25,829
charges on membranes and it's that that
makes me think that uh there's probably

616
00:10:25,829 --> 00:10:25,839
makes me think that uh there's probably
 

617
00:10:25,839 --> 00:10:27,430
makes me think that uh there's probably
probably many unsuccessful attempts at

618
00:10:27,430 --> 00:10:27,440
probably many unsuccessful attempts at
 

619
00:10:27,440 --> 00:10:29,829
probably many unsuccessful attempts at
only one really successful attempt

620
00:10:29,829 --> 00:10:29,839
only one really successful attempt
 

621
00:10:29,839 --> 00:10:31,750
only one really successful attempt
can you explain why that divergence

622
00:10:31,750 --> 00:10:31,760
can you explain why that divergence
 

623
00:10:31,760 --> 00:10:33,670
can you explain why that divergence
makes you think there's one answer uh

624
00:10:33,670 --> 00:10:33,680
makes you think there's one answer uh
 

625
00:10:33,680 --> 00:10:35,990
makes you think there's one answer uh
one common ancestor

626
00:10:35,990 --> 00:10:36,000
one common ancestor
 

627
00:10:36,000 --> 00:10:37,990
one common ancestor
okay can you describe that intuition i'm

628
00:10:37,990 --> 00:10:38,000
okay can you describe that intuition i'm
 

629
00:10:38,000 --> 00:10:40,230
okay can you describe that intuition i'm
a little bit unclear about why the diver

630
00:10:40,230 --> 00:10:40,240
a little bit unclear about why the diver
 

631
00:10:40,240 --> 00:10:42,389
a little bit unclear about why the diver
like the leap from the divergence

632
00:10:42,389 --> 00:10:42,399
like the leap from the divergence
 

633
00:10:42,399 --> 00:10:43,990
like the leap from the divergence
means there's one

634
00:10:43,990 --> 00:10:44,000
means there's one
 

635
00:10:44,000 --> 00:10:46,310
means there's one
do you mean like the divergence

636
00:10:46,310 --> 00:10:46,320
do you mean like the divergence
 

637
00:10:46,320 --> 00:10:49,590
do you mean like the divergence
indicates that there was a big invention

638
00:10:49,590 --> 00:10:49,600
indicates that there was a big invention
 

639
00:10:49,600 --> 00:10:51,509
indicates that there was a big invention
at that time yes

640
00:10:51,509 --> 00:10:51,519
at that time yes
 

641
00:10:51,519 --> 00:10:53,750
at that time yes
if it was if if you've got

642
00:10:53,750 --> 00:10:53,760
if it was if if you've got
 

643
00:10:53,760 --> 00:10:55,670
if it was if if you've got
as i imagine it you have a common

644
00:10:55,670 --> 00:10:55,680
as i imagine it you have a common
 

645
00:10:55,680 --> 00:10:59,030
as i imagine it you have a common
ancestor living in a hydrothermal vent

646
00:10:59,030 --> 00:10:59,040
ancestor living in a hydrothermal vent
 

647
00:10:59,040 --> 00:11:00,949
ancestor living in a hydrothermal vent
let's say there are you know millions of

648
00:11:00,949 --> 00:11:00,959
let's say there are you know millions of
 

649
00:11:00,959 --> 00:11:03,430
let's say there are you know millions of
vents and millions of potential common

650
00:11:03,430 --> 00:11:03,440
vents and millions of potential common
 

651
00:11:03,440 --> 00:11:05,829
vents and millions of potential common
ancestors living in all of those vents

652
00:11:05,829 --> 00:11:05,839
ancestors living in all of those vents
 

653
00:11:05,839 --> 00:11:09,269
ancestors living in all of those vents
but only one of them makes it out first

654
00:11:09,269 --> 00:11:09,279
but only one of them makes it out first
 

655
00:11:09,279 --> 00:11:11,110
but only one of them makes it out first
then you could imagine that that cell is

656
00:11:11,110 --> 00:11:11,120
then you could imagine that that cell is
 

657
00:11:11,120 --> 00:11:12,230
then you could imagine that that cell is
then going to kind of take over the

658
00:11:12,230 --> 00:11:12,240
then going to kind of take over the
 

659
00:11:12,240 --> 00:11:14,310
then going to kind of take over the
world and and wipe out everything else

660
00:11:14,310 --> 00:11:14,320
world and and wipe out everything else
 

661
00:11:14,320 --> 00:11:16,550
world and and wipe out everything else
and so you what you would see would be a

662
00:11:16,550 --> 00:11:16,560
and so you what you would see would be a
 

663
00:11:16,560 --> 00:11:18,790
and so you what you would see would be a
single common ancestor for all of life

664
00:11:18,790 --> 00:11:18,800
single common ancestor for all of life
 

665
00:11:18,800 --> 00:11:20,710
single common ancestor for all of life
but with you know lots lots of different

666
00:11:20,710 --> 00:11:20,720
but with you know lots lots of different
 

667
00:11:20,720 --> 00:11:22,710
but with you know lots lots of different
vent systems all kind of

668
00:11:22,710 --> 00:11:22,720
vent systems all kind of
 

669
00:11:22,720 --> 00:11:24,710
vent systems all kind of
vying to create the first life forms you

670
00:11:24,710 --> 00:11:24,720
vying to create the first life forms you
 

671
00:11:24,720 --> 00:11:27,190
vying to create the first life forms you
might say so this thing is a cell a

672
00:11:27,190 --> 00:11:27,200
might say so this thing is a cell a
 

673
00:11:27,200 --> 00:11:28,310
might say so this thing is a cell a
single cell well

674
00:11:28,310 --> 00:11:28,320
single cell well
 

675
00:11:28,320 --> 00:11:29,990
single cell well
we're always talking about populations

676
00:11:29,990 --> 00:11:30,000
we're always talking about populations
 

677
00:11:30,000 --> 00:11:31,750
we're always talking about populations
of cells but yes

678
00:11:31,750 --> 00:11:31,760
of cells but yes
 

679
00:11:31,760 --> 00:11:34,230
of cells but yes
these are cell organisms but the

680
00:11:34,230 --> 00:11:34,240
these are cell organisms but the
 

681
00:11:34,240 --> 00:11:35,430
these are cell organisms but the
fundamental

682
00:11:35,430 --> 00:11:35,440
fundamental
 

683
00:11:35,440 --> 00:11:37,430
fundamental
life form is a single cell

684
00:11:37,430 --> 00:11:37,440
life form is a single cell
 

685
00:11:37,440 --> 00:11:38,790
life form is a single cell
right so like

686
00:11:38,790 --> 00:11:38,800
right so like
 

687
00:11:38,800 --> 00:11:39,750
right so like
or

688
00:11:39,750 --> 00:11:39,760
or
 

689
00:11:39,760 --> 00:11:41,750
or
so they're always together

690
00:11:41,750 --> 00:11:41,760
so they're always together
 

691
00:11:41,760 --> 00:11:44,069
so they're always together
but they're alone together

692
00:11:44,069 --> 00:11:44,079
but they're alone together
 

693
00:11:44,079 --> 00:11:45,910
but they're alone together
yeah there's a machinery in each one

694
00:11:45,910 --> 00:11:45,920
yeah there's a machinery in each one
 

695
00:11:45,920 --> 00:11:48,949
yeah there's a machinery in each one
individual component that if left by

696
00:11:48,949 --> 00:11:48,959
individual component that if left by
 

697
00:11:48,959 --> 00:11:50,310
individual component that if left by
itself would still

698
00:11:50,310 --> 00:11:50,320
itself would still
 

699
00:11:50,320 --> 00:11:52,550
itself would still
work yes yes yes it's the unit of

700
00:11:52,550 --> 00:11:52,560
work yes yes yes it's the unit of
 

701
00:11:52,560 --> 00:11:55,110
work yes yes yes it's the unit of
selection is a single cell but selection

702
00:11:55,110 --> 00:11:55,120
selection is a single cell but selection
 

703
00:11:55,120 --> 00:11:57,190
selection is a single cell but selection
operates over generations and changes

704
00:11:57,190 --> 00:11:57,200
operates over generations and changes
 

705
00:11:57,200 --> 00:11:59,430
operates over generations and changes
over generations in populations of cells

706
00:11:59,430 --> 00:11:59,440
over generations in populations of cells
 

707
00:11:59,440 --> 00:12:00,949
over generations in populations of cells
so it would be impossible to say that a

708
00:12:00,949 --> 00:12:00,959
so it would be impossible to say that a
 

709
00:12:00,959 --> 00:12:02,710
so it would be impossible to say that a
cell is the unit of selection in the

710
00:12:02,710 --> 00:12:02,720
cell is the unit of selection in the
 

711
00:12:02,720 --> 00:12:03,750
cell is the unit of selection in the
sense that

712
00:12:03,750 --> 00:12:03,760
sense that
 

713
00:12:03,760 --> 00:12:05,350
sense that
you unless you have a population you

714
00:12:05,350 --> 00:12:05,360
you unless you have a population you
 

715
00:12:05,360 --> 00:12:07,350
you unless you have a population you
can't evolve you can't change

716
00:12:07,350 --> 00:12:07,360
can't evolve you can't change
 

717
00:12:07,360 --> 00:12:10,470
can't evolve you can't change
right but there was one

718
00:12:10,470 --> 00:12:10,480
right but there was one
 

719
00:12:10,480 --> 00:12:12,069
right but there was one
chuck norris

720
00:12:12,069 --> 00:12:12,079
chuck norris
 

721
00:12:12,079 --> 00:12:15,269
chuck norris
it's an american reference yeah uh cell

722
00:12:15,269 --> 00:12:15,279
it's an american reference yeah uh cell
 

723
00:12:15,279 --> 00:12:17,190
it's an american reference yeah uh cell
that made it out of the vents

724
00:12:17,190 --> 00:12:17,200
that made it out of the vents
 

725
00:12:17,200 --> 00:12:18,470
that made it out of the vents
right or

726
00:12:18,470 --> 00:12:18,480
right or
 

727
00:12:18,480 --> 00:12:20,629
right or
like the first one so imagine then

728
00:12:20,629 --> 00:12:20,639
like the first one so imagine then
 

729
00:12:20,639 --> 00:12:22,470
like the first one so imagine then
there's one cell gets out and it takes

730
00:12:22,470 --> 00:12:22,480
there's one cell gets out and it takes
 

731
00:12:22,480 --> 00:12:24,629
there's one cell gets out and it takes
over the world it gets out in the water

732
00:12:24,629 --> 00:12:24,639
over the world it gets out in the water
 

733
00:12:24,639 --> 00:12:26,069
over the world it gets out in the water
it's like floating around we're deep in

734
00:12:26,069 --> 00:12:26,079
it's like floating around we're deep in
 

735
00:12:26,079 --> 00:12:28,949
it's like floating around we're deep in
the ocean somewhere yeah but actually

736
00:12:28,949 --> 00:12:28,959
the ocean somewhere yeah but actually
 

737
00:12:28,959 --> 00:12:31,190
the ocean somewhere yeah but actually
two cells got out

738
00:12:31,190 --> 00:12:31,200
two cells got out
 

739
00:12:31,200 --> 00:12:33,269
two cells got out
um and they appear to have got out from

740
00:12:33,269 --> 00:12:33,279
um and they appear to have got out from
 

741
00:12:33,279 --> 00:12:34,389
um and they appear to have got out from
the same

742
00:12:34,389 --> 00:12:34,399
the same
 

743
00:12:34,399 --> 00:12:35,430
the same
vent

744
00:12:35,430 --> 00:12:35,440
vent
 

745
00:12:35,440 --> 00:12:37,350
vent
because they both share the same code

746
00:12:37,350 --> 00:12:37,360
because they both share the same code
 

747
00:12:37,360 --> 00:12:39,829
because they both share the same code
and everything else so unless all the

748
00:12:39,829 --> 00:12:39,839
and everything else so unless all the
 

749
00:12:39,839 --> 00:12:41,030
and everything else so unless all the
you know we've got a million different

750
00:12:41,030 --> 00:12:41,040
you know we've got a million different
 

751
00:12:41,040 --> 00:12:43,030
you know we've got a million different
common ancestors in in all these

752
00:12:43,030 --> 00:12:43,040
common ancestors in in all these
 

753
00:12:43,040 --> 00:12:45,509
common ancestors in in all these
different vents so either they all have

754
00:12:45,509 --> 00:12:45,519
different vents so either they all have
 

755
00:12:45,519 --> 00:12:47,670
different vents so either they all have
the same code and two cells

756
00:12:47,670 --> 00:12:47,680
the same code and two cells
 

757
00:12:47,680 --> 00:12:48,949
the same code and two cells
spontaneously merge from different

758
00:12:48,949 --> 00:12:48,959
spontaneously merge from different
 

759
00:12:48,959 --> 00:12:50,710
spontaneously merge from different
places or

760
00:12:50,710 --> 00:12:50,720
places or
 

761
00:12:50,720 --> 00:12:53,190
places or
two two different cells fundamentally

762
00:12:53,190 --> 00:12:53,200
two two different cells fundamentally
 

763
00:12:53,200 --> 00:12:55,670
two two different cells fundamentally
different cells came from the same place

764
00:12:55,670 --> 00:12:55,680
different cells came from the same place
 

765
00:12:55,680 --> 00:12:58,470
different cells came from the same place
so either way what are the constraints

766
00:12:58,470 --> 00:12:58,480
so either way what are the constraints
 

767
00:12:58,480 --> 00:13:00,550
so either way what are the constraints
that say not just one came out or not

768
00:13:00,550 --> 00:13:00,560
that say not just one came out or not
 

769
00:13:00,560 --> 00:13:02,710
that say not just one came out or not
half a million came out but two

770
00:13:02,710 --> 00:13:02,720
half a million came out but two
 

771
00:13:02,720 --> 00:13:05,190
half a million came out but two
came out that's kind of a bit strange uh

772
00:13:05,190 --> 00:13:05,200
came out that's kind of a bit strange uh
 

773
00:13:05,200 --> 00:13:07,030
came out that's kind of a bit strange uh
so how did they come out well they come

774
00:13:07,030 --> 00:13:07,040
so how did they come out well they come
 

775
00:13:07,040 --> 00:13:08,069
so how did they come out well they come
out because

776
00:13:08,069 --> 00:13:08,079
out because
 

777
00:13:08,079 --> 00:13:09,990
out because
what you're doing inside event is you're

778
00:13:09,990 --> 00:13:10,000
what you're doing inside event is you're
 

779
00:13:10,000 --> 00:13:12,310
what you're doing inside event is you're
relying on the electrical charges down

780
00:13:12,310 --> 00:13:12,320
relying on the electrical charges down
 

781
00:13:12,320 --> 00:13:14,230
relying on the electrical charges down
there to power this reaction between

782
00:13:14,230 --> 00:13:14,240
there to power this reaction between
 

783
00:13:14,240 --> 00:13:16,790
there to power this reaction between
hydrogen and co2 to make yourself grow

784
00:13:16,790 --> 00:13:16,800
hydrogen and co2 to make yourself grow
 

785
00:13:16,800 --> 00:13:18,150
hydrogen and co2 to make yourself grow
and when you leave the vent you've got

786
00:13:18,150 --> 00:13:18,160
and when you leave the vent you've got
 

787
00:13:18,160 --> 00:13:19,750
and when you leave the vent you've got
to do that yourself you've got to power

788
00:13:19,750 --> 00:13:19,760
to do that yourself you've got to power
 

789
00:13:19,760 --> 00:13:21,829
to do that yourself you've got to power
up your own membrane and so the question

790
00:13:21,829 --> 00:13:21,839
up your own membrane and so the question
 

791
00:13:21,839 --> 00:13:23,670
up your own membrane and so the question
is well how do you power up your own

792
00:13:23,670 --> 00:13:23,680
is well how do you power up your own
 

793
00:13:23,680 --> 00:13:24,949
is well how do you power up your own
membrane

794
00:13:24,949 --> 00:13:24,959
membrane
 

795
00:13:24,959 --> 00:13:27,110
membrane
and the answer is well you need to pump

796
00:13:27,110 --> 00:13:27,120
and the answer is well you need to pump
 

797
00:13:27,120 --> 00:13:29,030
and the answer is well you need to pump
you need to pump ions to give an

798
00:13:29,030 --> 00:13:29,040
you need to pump ions to give an
 

799
00:13:29,040 --> 00:13:30,949
you need to pump ions to give an
electrical charge on the membrane so

800
00:13:30,949 --> 00:13:30,959
electrical charge on the membrane so
 

801
00:13:30,959 --> 00:13:32,310
electrical charge on the membrane so
what do the pumps look like well the

802
00:13:32,310 --> 00:13:32,320
what do the pumps look like well the
 

803
00:13:32,320 --> 00:13:35,190
what do the pumps look like well the
pumps look different in these two groups

804
00:13:35,190 --> 00:13:35,200
pumps look different in these two groups
 

805
00:13:35,200 --> 00:13:37,110
pumps look different in these two groups
it's as if they they both emerge from a

806
00:13:37,110 --> 00:13:37,120
it's as if they they both emerge from a
 

807
00:13:37,120 --> 00:13:38,389
it's as if they they both emerge from a
common ancestor as soon as you've got

808
00:13:38,389 --> 00:13:38,399
common ancestor as soon as you've got
 

809
00:13:38,399 --> 00:13:41,189
common ancestor as soon as you've got
that ancestor things move very quickly

810
00:13:41,189 --> 00:13:41,199
that ancestor things move very quickly
 

811
00:13:41,199 --> 00:13:42,389
that ancestor things move very quickly
um and

812
00:13:42,389 --> 00:13:42,399
um and
 

813
00:13:42,399 --> 00:13:44,790
um and
and divergently why does the dna

814
00:13:44,790 --> 00:13:44,800
and divergently why does the dna
 

815
00:13:44,800 --> 00:13:46,389
and divergently why does the dna
replication look different well it's

816
00:13:46,389 --> 00:13:46,399
replication look different well it's
 

817
00:13:46,399 --> 00:13:47,829
replication look different well it's
joined to the membrane the membranes are

818
00:13:47,829 --> 00:13:47,839
joined to the membrane the membranes are
 

819
00:13:47,839 --> 00:13:49,269
joined to the membrane the membranes are
different the dna replication is

820
00:13:49,269 --> 00:13:49,279
different the dna replication is
 

821
00:13:49,279 --> 00:13:50,629
different the dna replication is
different because it's joined to a

822
00:13:50,629 --> 00:13:50,639
different because it's joined to a
 

823
00:13:50,639 --> 00:13:52,550
different because it's joined to a
different kind of membrane so there's

824
00:13:52,550 --> 00:13:52,560
different kind of membrane so there's
 

825
00:13:52,560 --> 00:13:54,949
different kind of membrane so there's
interesting you know this this is detail

826
00:13:54,949 --> 00:13:54,959
interesting you know this this is detail
 

827
00:13:54,959 --> 00:13:56,949
interesting you know this this is detail
you may say but it's also fundamental

828
00:13:56,949 --> 00:13:56,959
you may say but it's also fundamental
 

829
00:13:56,959 --> 00:13:59,189
you may say but it's also fundamental
because it's about the two big divergent

830
00:13:59,189 --> 00:13:59,199
because it's about the two big divergent
 

831
00:13:59,199 --> 00:14:00,710
because it's about the two big divergent
groups of life on earth that seem to

832
00:14:00,710 --> 00:14:00,720
groups of life on earth that seem to
 

833
00:14:00,720 --> 00:14:03,189
groups of life on earth that seem to
have diverged really early on it all

834
00:14:03,189 --> 00:14:03,199
have diverged really early on it all
 

835
00:14:03,199 --> 00:14:04,710
have diverged really early on it all
started from

836
00:14:04,710 --> 00:14:04,720
started from
 

837
00:14:04,720 --> 00:14:06,470
started from
one organism

838
00:14:06,470 --> 00:14:06,480
one organism
 

839
00:14:06,480 --> 00:14:07,509
one organism
and then

840
00:14:07,509 --> 00:14:07,519
and then
 

841
00:14:07,519 --> 00:14:09,509
and then
that organs just start replicating the

842
00:14:09,509 --> 00:14:09,519
that organs just start replicating the
 

843
00:14:09,519 --> 00:14:11,590
that organs just start replicating the
heck out of itself

844
00:14:11,590 --> 00:14:11,600
heck out of itself
 

845
00:14:11,600 --> 00:14:14,550
heck out of itself
with some mutation of the dna so like

846
00:14:14,550 --> 00:14:14,560
with some mutation of the dna so like
 

847
00:14:14,560 --> 00:14:17,350
with some mutation of the dna so like
there's some um there's a competition

848
00:14:17,350 --> 00:14:17,360
there's some um there's a competition
 

849
00:14:17,360 --> 00:14:19,430
there's some um there's a competition
through the process of evolution they're

850
00:14:19,430 --> 00:14:19,440
through the process of evolution they're
 

851
00:14:19,440 --> 00:14:21,189
through the process of evolution they're
not like trying to beat each other up

852
00:14:21,189 --> 00:14:21,199
not like trying to beat each other up
 

853
00:14:21,199 --> 00:14:22,629
not like trying to beat each other up
they're just

854
00:14:22,629 --> 00:14:22,639
they're just
 

855
00:14:22,639 --> 00:14:24,230
they're just
they're just trying to live they just

856
00:14:24,230 --> 00:14:24,240
they're just trying to live they just
 

857
00:14:24,240 --> 00:14:25,590
they're just trying to live they just
replicate us

858
00:14:25,590 --> 00:14:25,600
replicate us
 

859
00:14:25,600 --> 00:14:28,069
replicate us
yeah well you know let's not minimize

860
00:14:28,069 --> 00:14:28,079
yeah well you know let's not minimize
 

861
00:14:28,079 --> 00:14:32,550
yeah well you know let's not minimize
their yeah

862
00:14:32,550 --> 00:14:32,560

 

863
00:14:32,560 --> 00:14:34,949

there's no sense of trying to survive

864
00:14:34,949 --> 00:14:34,959
there's no sense of trying to survive
 

865
00:14:34,959 --> 00:14:36,870
there's no sense of trying to survive
they're replicating i mean there's no

866
00:14:36,870 --> 00:14:36,880
they're replicating i mean there's no
 

867
00:14:36,880 --> 00:14:39,030
they're replicating i mean there's no
sense in which they're trying to do

868
00:14:39,030 --> 00:14:39,040
sense in which they're trying to do
 

869
00:14:39,040 --> 00:14:40,790
sense in which they're trying to do
anything they're just a kind of an

870
00:14:40,790 --> 00:14:40,800
anything they're just a kind of an
 

871
00:14:40,800 --> 00:14:42,629
anything they're just a kind of an
outgrowth of the earth you might say of

872
00:14:42,629 --> 00:14:42,639
outgrowth of the earth you might say of
 

873
00:14:42,639 --> 00:14:44,310
outgrowth of the earth you might say of
course the aliens would describe us

874
00:14:44,310 --> 00:14:44,320
course the aliens would describe us
 

875
00:14:44,320 --> 00:14:46,550
course the aliens would describe us
humans in that same way

876
00:14:46,550 --> 00:14:46,560
humans in that same way
 

877
00:14:46,560 --> 00:14:48,710
humans in that same way
they might be right primitive life it's

878
00:14:48,710 --> 00:14:48,720
they might be right primitive life it's
 

879
00:14:48,720 --> 00:14:52,470
they might be right primitive life it's
just it's just ants that are hairless

880
00:14:52,470 --> 00:14:52,480
just it's just ants that are hairless
 

881
00:14:52,480 --> 00:14:54,870
just it's just ants that are hairless
mostly hairless overgrown ants overgrown

882
00:14:54,870 --> 00:14:54,880
mostly hairless overgrown ants overgrown
 

883
00:14:54,880 --> 00:14:57,430
mostly hairless overgrown ants overgrown
ants okay um what do you think about the

884
00:14:57,430 --> 00:14:57,440
ants okay um what do you think about the
 

885
00:14:57,440 --> 00:14:58,389
ants okay um what do you think about the
idea of

886
00:14:58,389 --> 00:14:58,399
idea of
 

887
00:14:58,399 --> 00:15:00,470
idea of
panspermia that

888
00:15:00,470 --> 00:15:00,480
panspermia that
 

889
00:15:00,480 --> 00:15:02,550
panspermia that
the theory that life did not originate

890
00:15:02,550 --> 00:15:02,560
the theory that life did not originate
 

891
00:15:02,560 --> 00:15:05,430
the theory that life did not originate
on earth and was planted here from outer

892
00:15:05,430 --> 00:15:05,440
on earth and was planted here from outer
 

893
00:15:05,440 --> 00:15:06,790
on earth and was planted here from outer
space

894
00:15:06,790 --> 00:15:06,800
space
 

895
00:15:06,800 --> 00:15:09,189
space
or pseudo panspermia which is like the

896
00:15:09,189 --> 00:15:09,199
or pseudo panspermia which is like the
 

897
00:15:09,199 --> 00:15:11,350
or pseudo panspermia which is like the
basic ingredients the magic that you

898
00:15:11,350 --> 00:15:11,360
basic ingredients the magic that you
 

899
00:15:11,360 --> 00:15:13,030
basic ingredients the magic that you
mentioned was planted here from

900
00:15:13,030 --> 00:15:13,040
mentioned was planted here from
 

901
00:15:13,040 --> 00:15:14,629
mentioned was planted here from
elsewhere in space

902
00:15:14,629 --> 00:15:14,639
elsewhere in space
 

903
00:15:14,639 --> 00:15:16,629
elsewhere in space
i don't find them helpful that's not to

904
00:15:16,629 --> 00:15:16,639
i don't find them helpful that's not to
 

905
00:15:16,639 --> 00:15:17,829
i don't find them helpful that's not to
say they're wrong

906
00:15:17,829 --> 00:15:17,839
say they're wrong
 

907
00:15:17,839 --> 00:15:18,790
say they're wrong
uh

908
00:15:18,790 --> 00:15:18,800
uh
 

909
00:15:18,800 --> 00:15:21,350
uh
so so pseudotranspermia the idea that

910
00:15:21,350 --> 00:15:21,360
so so pseudotranspermia the idea that
 

911
00:15:21,360 --> 00:15:23,030
so so pseudotranspermia the idea that
you know the chemicals the amino acids

912
00:15:23,030 --> 00:15:23,040
you know the chemicals the amino acids
 

913
00:15:23,040 --> 00:15:24,470
you know the chemicals the amino acids
the nucleotides are being delivered from

914
00:15:24,470 --> 00:15:24,480
the nucleotides are being delivered from
 

915
00:15:24,480 --> 00:15:26,150
the nucleotides are being delivered from
space well we know that happens it's

916
00:15:26,150 --> 00:15:26,160
space well we know that happens it's
 

917
00:15:26,160 --> 00:15:27,829
space well we know that happens it's
unequivocal they're delivered on

918
00:15:27,829 --> 00:15:27,839
unequivocal they're delivered on
 

919
00:15:27,839 --> 00:15:29,910
unequivocal they're delivered on
meteorites comets and so on

920
00:15:29,910 --> 00:15:29,920
meteorites comets and so on
 

921
00:15:29,920 --> 00:15:30,710
meteorites comets and so on
um

922
00:15:30,710 --> 00:15:30,720
um
 

923
00:15:30,720 --> 00:15:32,629
um
so what do they do next that's to me the

924
00:15:32,629 --> 00:15:32,639
so what do they do next that's to me the
 

925
00:15:32,639 --> 00:15:34,069
so what do they do next that's to me the
question and well what they do is they

926
00:15:34,069 --> 00:15:34,079
question and well what they do is they
 

927
00:15:34,079 --> 00:15:35,910
question and well what they do is they
stock a soup like presumably they land

928
00:15:35,910 --> 00:15:35,920
stock a soup like presumably they land
 

929
00:15:35,920 --> 00:15:37,749
stock a soup like presumably they land
in a pond or in an ocean or wherever

930
00:15:37,749 --> 00:15:37,759
in a pond or in an ocean or wherever
 

931
00:15:37,759 --> 00:15:38,870
in a pond or in an ocean or wherever
they land

932
00:15:38,870 --> 00:15:38,880
they land
 

933
00:15:38,880 --> 00:15:40,870
they land
and then you end up with a you know best

934
00:15:40,870 --> 00:15:40,880
and then you end up with a you know best
 

935
00:15:40,880 --> 00:15:42,470
and then you end up with a you know best
possible case scenario is you end up

936
00:15:42,470 --> 00:15:42,480
possible case scenario is you end up
 

937
00:15:42,480 --> 00:15:44,550
possible case scenario is you end up
with a super nucleotides and amino acids

938
00:15:44,550 --> 00:15:44,560
with a super nucleotides and amino acids
 

939
00:15:44,560 --> 00:15:45,910
with a super nucleotides and amino acids
and then you have to say so now what

940
00:15:45,910 --> 00:15:45,920
and then you have to say so now what
 

941
00:15:45,920 --> 00:15:47,189
and then you have to say so now what
happens and the answer is oh well they

942
00:15:47,189 --> 00:15:47,199
happens and the answer is oh well they
 

943
00:15:47,199 --> 00:15:49,509
happens and the answer is oh well they
have to go

944
00:15:49,509 --> 00:15:49,519
have to go
 

945
00:15:49,519 --> 00:15:51,670
have to go
become alive so how did they do that you

946
00:15:51,670 --> 00:15:51,680
become alive so how did they do that you
 

947
00:15:51,680 --> 00:15:54,629
become alive so how did they do that you
may as well say then a miracle happened

948
00:15:54,629 --> 00:15:54,639
may as well say then a miracle happened
 

949
00:15:54,639 --> 00:15:56,949
may as well say then a miracle happened
i don't believe in soup

950
00:15:56,949 --> 00:15:56,959
i don't believe in soup
 

951
00:15:56,959 --> 00:15:59,430
i don't believe in soup
i i think what we have in a vent is a

i i think what we have in a vent is a
 

953
00:15:59,440 --> 00:16:01,189

970
00:16:16,870 --> 00:16:16,880
soup
 

971
00:16:16,880 --> 00:16:17,829
soup
isn't

972
00:16:17,829 --> 00:16:17,839
isn't
 

973
00:16:17,839 --> 00:16:20,310
isn't
the entire universe and living organisms

the entire universe and living organisms
 

975
00:16:20,320 --> 00:16:23,670
the entire universe and living organisms
in the universe isn't it just uh

976
00:16:23,670 --> 00:16:23,680
in the universe isn't it just uh
 

977
00:16:23,680 --> 00:16:25,990

soup all the way down isn't it also no

00:16:25,990 --> 00:16:26,000
soup all the way down isn't it also no
 

979
00:16:26,000 --> 00:16:27,590
soup all the way down isn't it also no
no i mean soup almost by definition

980
00:16:27,590 --> 00:16:27,600
no i mean soup almost by definition
 

981
00:16:27,600 --> 00:16:29,430
no i mean soup almost by definition
doesn't have a structure

but soup is a collection of ingredients

984
00:16:31,990 --> 00:16:32,000
but soup is a collection of ingredients
 

985
00:16:32,000 --> 00:16:34,829
but soup is a collection of ingredients
that are like randomly

986
00:16:34,829 --> 00:16:34,839
that are like randomly
 

987
00:16:34,839 --> 00:16:37,350
that are like randomly
yeah they're not i mean

988
00:16:37,350 --> 00:16:37,360
yeah they're not i mean
 

989
00:16:37,360 --> 00:16:39,030
yeah they're not i mean
we have chemistry going on here we have

990
00:16:39,030 --> 00:16:39,040
we have chemistry going on here we have
 

991
00:16:39,040 --> 00:16:40,870
we have chemistry going on here we have
metadata forming which are which are you

992
00:16:40,870 --> 00:16:40,880
metadata forming which are which are you
 

993
00:16:40,880 --> 00:16:43,269
metadata forming which are which are you
know effective oil water interactions

994
00:16:43,269 --> 00:16:43,279
know effective oil water interactions
 

995
00:16:43,279 --> 00:16:44,550
know effective oil water interactions
okay so it feels like there's a

996
00:16:44,550 --> 00:16:44,560
okay so it feels like there's a
 

997
00:16:44,560 --> 00:16:46,550
okay so it feels like there's a
direction to a process like a director

998
00:16:46,550 --> 00:16:46,560
direction to a process like a director
 

999
00:16:46,560 --> 00:16:47,350
direction to a process like a director
there are

1000
00:16:47,350 --> 00:16:47,360
there are
 

1001
00:16:47,360 --> 00:16:49,990
there are
there are directions to processes yeah

1002
00:16:49,990 --> 00:16:50,000
there are directions to processes yeah
 

1003
00:16:50,000 --> 00:16:51,430
there are directions to processes yeah
and if you are com if you're starting

1004
00:16:51,430 --> 00:16:51,440
and if you are com if you're starting
 

1005
00:16:51,440 --> 00:16:54,150
and if you are com if you're starting
with co2 and you've got two reactive

1006
00:16:54,150 --> 00:16:54,160
with co2 and you've got two reactive
 

1007
00:16:54,160 --> 00:16:55,829
with co2 and you've got two reactive
fluids being brought together and they

1008
00:16:55,829 --> 00:16:55,839
fluids being brought together and they
 

1009
00:16:55,839 --> 00:16:57,590
fluids being brought together and they
they react what are they going to make

1010
00:16:57,590 --> 00:16:57,600
they react what are they going to make
 

1011
00:16:57,600 --> 00:16:59,749
they react what are they going to make
well they they make carboxylic acids

1012
00:16:59,749 --> 00:16:59,759
well they they make carboxylic acids
 

1013
00:16:59,759 --> 00:17:01,910
well they they make carboxylic acids
which include the fatty acids that make

1014
00:17:01,910 --> 00:17:01,920
which include the fatty acids that make
 

1015
00:17:01,920 --> 00:17:04,309
which include the fatty acids that make
up the cell membranes and and they form

1016
00:17:04,309 --> 00:17:04,319
up the cell membranes and and they form
 

1017
00:17:04,319 --> 00:17:06,549
up the cell membranes and and they form
directly into bilayer membranes they

1018
00:17:06,549 --> 00:17:06,559
directly into bilayer membranes they
 

1019
00:17:06,559 --> 00:17:08,630
directly into bilayer membranes they
form like soap bubbles it's spontaneous

1020
00:17:08,630 --> 00:17:08,640
form like soap bubbles it's spontaneous
 

1021
00:17:08,640 --> 00:17:09,909
form like soap bubbles it's spontaneous
organization

1022
00:17:09,909 --> 00:17:09,919
organization
 

1023
00:17:09,919 --> 00:17:11,829
organization
caused by the nature of the molecules

1024
00:17:11,829 --> 00:17:11,839
caused by the nature of the molecules
 

1025
00:17:11,839 --> 00:17:13,510
caused by the nature of the molecules
and and those things are capable of

1026
00:17:13,510 --> 00:17:13,520
and and those things are capable of
 

1027
00:17:13,520 --> 00:17:15,429
and and those things are capable of
growing and are capable in effect of

1028
00:17:15,429 --> 00:17:15,439
growing and are capable in effect of
 

1029
00:17:15,439 --> 00:17:17,270
growing and are capable in effect of
being selected even before there are

1030
00:17:17,270 --> 00:17:17,280
being selected even before there are
 

1031
00:17:17,280 --> 00:17:19,189
being selected even before there are
genes we have this so we have a lot of

1032
00:17:19,189 --> 00:17:19,199
genes we have this so we have a lot of
 

1033
00:17:19,199 --> 00:17:21,590
genes we have this so we have a lot of
order and that order is coming from

1034
00:17:21,590 --> 00:17:21,600
order and that order is coming from
 

1035
00:17:21,600 --> 00:17:23,909
order and that order is coming from
thermodynamics and the thermodynamics is

1036
00:17:23,909 --> 00:17:23,919
thermodynamics and the thermodynamics is
 

1037
00:17:23,919 --> 00:17:25,829
thermodynamics and the thermodynamics is
always about increasing the entropy of

00:17:25,839 --> 00:17:28,230
always about increasing the entropy of
the universe but if you have

question about um panspermia properly

1054
00:17:42,630 --> 00:17:42,640
question about um panspermia properly
 

1055
00:17:42,640 --> 00:17:43,669
question about um panspermia properly
um

1056
00:17:43,669 --> 00:17:43,679
um
 

1057
00:17:43,679 --> 00:17:45,110
um
that just pushes the question somewhere

1058
00:17:45,110 --> 00:17:45,120
that just pushes the question somewhere
 

1059
00:17:45,120 --> 00:17:46,950
that just pushes the question somewhere
else that just even if it's true maybe

1060
00:17:46,950 --> 00:17:46,960
else that just even if it's true maybe
 

1061
00:17:46,960 --> 00:17:48,870
else that just even if it's true maybe
life did start on earth by panspermia

1062
00:17:48,870 --> 00:17:48,880
life did start on earth by panspermia
 

1063
00:17:48,880 --> 00:17:52,150
life did start on earth by panspermia
but but so what are the principles

1064
00:17:52,150 --> 00:17:52,160
but but so what are the principles
 

1065
00:17:52,160 --> 00:17:53,990
but but so what are the principles
that govern the emergence of life on any

1066
00:17:53,990 --> 00:17:54,000
that govern the emergence of life on any
 

1067
00:17:54,000 --> 00:17:56,230
that govern the emergence of life on any
planet we it's an assumption that life

1068
00:17:56,230 --> 00:17:56,240
planet we it's an assumption that life
 

1069
00:17:56,240 --> 00:17:59,510
planet we it's an assumption that life
started here and it's an assumption that

1070
00:17:59,510 --> 00:17:59,520
started here and it's an assumption that
 

1071
00:17:59,520 --> 00:18:01,590
started here and it's an assumption that
it you know it started in a hydrothermal

1072
00:18:01,590 --> 00:18:01,600
it you know it started in a hydrothermal
 

1073
00:18:01,600 --> 00:18:03,669
it you know it started in a hydrothermal
vent or it started in a terrestrial

1074
00:18:03,669 --> 00:18:03,679
vent or it started in a terrestrial
 

1075
00:18:03,679 --> 00:18:05,909
vent or it started in a terrestrial
geothermal system the question is can we

1076
00:18:05,909 --> 00:18:05,919
geothermal system the question is can we
 

1077
00:18:05,919 --> 00:18:07,830
geothermal system the question is can we
work out a testable sequence of events

1078
00:18:07,830 --> 00:18:07,840
work out a testable sequence of events
 

1079
00:18:07,840 --> 00:18:09,750
work out a testable sequence of events
that would lead from one to the other

1080
00:18:09,750 --> 00:18:09,760
that would lead from one to the other
 

1081
00:18:09,760 --> 00:18:11,669
that would lead from one to the other
one and then test it and see if there's

1082
00:18:11,669 --> 00:18:11,679
one and then test it and see if there's
 

1083
00:18:11,679 --> 00:18:13,270
one and then test it and see if there's
any truth in it or not with panspermia

1084
00:18:13,270 --> 00:18:13,280
any truth in it or not with panspermia
 

1085
00:18:13,280 --> 00:18:15,430
any truth in it or not with panspermia
you can't do any of that but the the

1086
00:18:15,430 --> 00:18:15,440
you can't do any of that but the the
 

1087
00:18:15,440 --> 00:18:17,830
you can't do any of that but the the
fundamental question of past sperm is do

1088
00:18:17,830 --> 00:18:17,840
fundamental question of past sperm is do
 

1089
00:18:17,840 --> 00:18:19,270
fundamental question of past sperm is do
we have

1090
00:18:19,270 --> 00:18:19,280
we have
 

1091
00:18:19,280 --> 00:18:23,190
we have
the machine here on earth to build life

1092
00:18:23,190 --> 00:18:23,200
the machine here on earth to build life
 

1093
00:18:23,200 --> 00:18:25,830
the machine here on earth to build life
is the vents enough

1094
00:18:25,830 --> 00:18:25,840
is the vents enough
 

1095
00:18:25,840 --> 00:18:26,830
is the vents enough
is

1096
00:18:26,830 --> 00:18:26,840
is
 

1097
00:18:26,840 --> 00:18:29,510
is
oxygen and hydrogen

1098
00:18:29,510 --> 00:18:29,520
oxygen and hydrogen
 

1099
00:18:29,520 --> 00:18:32,310
oxygen and hydrogen
and whatever the heck else we want and

1100
00:18:32,310 --> 00:18:32,320
and whatever the heck else we want and
 

1101
00:18:32,320 --> 00:18:34,789
and whatever the heck else we want and
some source of energy and heat is that

1102
00:18:34,789 --> 00:18:34,799
some source of energy and heat is that
 

1103
00:18:34,799 --> 00:18:36,390
some source of energy and heat is that
enough to build life

1104
00:18:36,390 --> 00:18:36,400
enough to build life
 

1105
00:18:36,400 --> 00:18:37,190
enough to build life
or

1106
00:18:37,190 --> 00:18:37,200
or
 

1107
00:18:37,200 --> 00:18:39,750
or
well that's

1108
00:18:39,750 --> 00:18:39,760
well that's
 

1109
00:18:39,760 --> 00:18:42,070
well that's
of course you would say that as a human

1110
00:18:42,070 --> 00:18:42,080
of course you would say that as a human
 

1111
00:18:42,080 --> 00:18:44,549
of course you would say that as a human
uh but there could be aliens right now

1112
00:18:44,549 --> 00:18:44,559
uh but there could be aliens right now
 

1113
00:18:44,559 --> 00:18:46,870
uh but there could be aliens right now
chuckling at that idea maybe you need

1114
00:18:46,870 --> 00:18:46,880
chuckling at that idea maybe you need
 

1115
00:18:46,880 --> 00:18:48,950
chuckling at that idea maybe you need
some special um

1116
00:18:48,950 --> 00:18:48,960
some special um
 

1117
00:18:48,960 --> 00:18:50,390

00:19:14,080 --> 00:19:17,510
place environment
and we find some slime that looks like

1144
00:19:17,510 --> 00:19:17,520
and we find some slime that looks like
 

1145
00:19:17,520 --> 00:19:18,789
and we find some slime that looks like
we can we can test it it's made of

1146
00:19:18,789 --> 00:19:18,799
we can we can test it it's made of
 

1147
00:19:18,799 --> 00:19:20,150
we can we can test it it's made of
organic molecules

1148
00:19:20,150 --> 00:19:20,160
organic molecules
 

1149
00:19:20,160 --> 00:19:21,350
organic molecules
it's got a structure which is not

1150
00:19:21,350 --> 00:19:21,360
it's got a structure which is not
 

1151
00:19:21,360 --> 00:19:24,470
it's got a structure which is not
obviously cells but you know it's is is

1152
00:19:24,470 --> 00:19:24,480
obviously cells but you know it's is is
 

1153
00:19:24,480 --> 00:19:26,230
obviously cells but you know it's is is
this a stepping stone on the way to life

1154
00:19:26,230 --> 00:19:26,240
this a stepping stone on the way to life
 

1155
00:19:26,240 --> 00:19:28,950
this a stepping stone on the way to life
or not yeah how do we know

1156
00:19:28,950 --> 00:19:28,960
or not yeah how do we know
 

1157
00:19:28,960 --> 00:19:30,950
or not yeah how do we know
unless we've got an intellectual

1158
00:19:30,950 --> 00:19:30,960
unless we've got an intellectual
 

1159
00:19:30,960 --> 00:19:32,789
unless we've got an intellectual
framework that says this is this is a

1160
00:19:32,789 --> 00:19:32,799
framework that says this is this is a
 

1161
00:19:32,799 --> 00:19:34,070
framework that says this is this is a
stepping stone and that's not us that

1162
00:19:34,070 --> 00:19:34,080
stepping stone and that's not us that
 

1163
00:19:34,080 --> 00:19:35,110
stepping stone and that's not us that
you know we'd never know we wouldn't

1164
00:19:35,110 --> 00:19:35,120
you know we'd never know we wouldn't
 

1165
00:19:35,120 --> 00:19:36,789
you know we'd never know we wouldn't
know which environment to go to what to

1166
00:19:36,789 --> 00:19:36,799
know which environment to go to what to
 

1167
00:19:36,799 --> 00:19:39,110
know which environment to go to what to
look for how to say this so all we can

1168
00:19:39,110 --> 00:19:39,120
look for how to say this so all we can
 

1169
00:19:39,120 --> 00:19:40,310
look for how to say this so all we can
ever hope for because we're never going

1170
00:19:40,310 --> 00:19:40,320
ever hope for because we're never going
 

1171
00:19:40,320 --> 00:19:42,230
ever hope for because we're never going
to build that time machine is to have an

1172
00:19:42,230 --> 00:19:42,240
to build that time machine is to have an
 

1173
00:19:42,240 --> 00:19:44,230
to build that time machine is to have an
intellectual framework that can explain

1174
00:19:44,230 --> 00:19:44,240
intellectual framework that can explain
 

1175
00:19:44,240 --> 00:19:46,789
intellectual framework that can explain
step by step experiment by experiment

1176
00:19:46,789 --> 00:19:46,799
step by step experiment by experiment
 

1177
00:19:46,799 --> 00:19:48,789
step by step experiment by experiment
how we go from a sterile inorganic

1178
00:19:48,789 --> 00:19:48,799
how we go from a sterile inorganic
 

1179
00:19:48,799 --> 00:19:52,310
how we go from a sterile inorganic
planet to living cells as we know them

1180
00:19:52,310 --> 00:19:52,320
planet to living cells as we know them
 

1181
00:19:52,320 --> 00:19:54,470
planet to living cells as we know them
and in that framework every time you

1182
00:19:54,470 --> 00:19:54,480
and in that framework every time you
 

1183
00:19:54,480 --> 00:19:56,150
and in that framework every time you
have a choice it could be this way or it

1184
00:19:56,150 --> 00:19:56,160
have a choice it could be this way or it
 

1185
00:19:56,160 --> 00:19:57,590
have a choice it could be this way or it
could be that way or you know there's

1186
00:19:57,590 --> 00:19:57,600
could be that way or you know there's
 

1187
00:19:57,600 --> 00:19:58,630
could be that way or you know there's
lots of

1188
00:19:58,630 --> 00:19:58,640
lots of
 

1189
00:19:58,640 --> 00:20:02,149
lots of
possible forks down that road um

1190
00:20:02,149 --> 00:20:02,159
possible forks down that road um
 

1191
00:20:02,159 --> 00:20:04,070
possible forks down that road um
did it have to be that way could it have

1192
00:20:04,070 --> 00:20:04,080
did it have to be that way could it have
 

1193
00:20:04,080 --> 00:20:05,750
did it have to be that way could it have
been the other way and would that have

1194
00:20:05,750 --> 00:20:05,760
been the other way and would that have
 

1195
00:20:05,760 --> 00:20:07,029
been the other way and would that have
given you life with very different

1196
00:20:07,029 --> 00:20:07,039
given you life with very different
 

1197
00:20:07,039 --> 00:20:08,070
given you life with very different
properties

1198
00:20:08,070 --> 00:20:08,080
properties
 

1199
00:20:08,080 --> 00:20:10,630
properties
um and so if you if you come up with a

1200
00:20:10,630 --> 00:20:10,640
um and so if you if you come up with a
 

1201
00:20:10,640 --> 00:20:12,149
um and so if you if you come up with a
you know it's a long hypothesis because

1202
00:20:12,149 --> 00:20:12,159
you know it's a long hypothesis because
 

1203
00:20:12,159 --> 00:20:14,470
you know it's a long hypothesis because
as i say we're going from really simple

1204
00:20:14,470 --> 00:20:14,480
as i say we're going from really simple
 

1205
00:20:14,480 --> 00:20:16,149
as i say we're going from really simple
prebiotic chemistry all the way through

1206
00:20:16,149 --> 00:20:16,159
prebiotic chemistry all the way through
 

1207
00:20:16,159 --> 00:20:18,070
prebiotic chemistry all the way through
to genes and molecular machines that's a

1208
00:20:18,070 --> 00:20:18,080
to genes and molecular machines that's a
 

1209
00:20:18,080 --> 00:20:20,789
to genes and molecular machines that's a
long long pathway and nobody in the

1210
00:20:20,789 --> 00:20:20,799
long long pathway and nobody in the
 

1211
00:20:20,799 --> 00:20:22,390
long long pathway and nobody in the
field would agree on the order in which

1212
00:20:22,390 --> 00:20:22,400
field would agree on the order in which
 

1213
00:20:22,400 --> 00:20:24,149
field would agree on the order in which
these things happened which is not a bad

1214
00:20:24,149 --> 00:20:24,159
these things happened which is not a bad
 

1215
00:20:24,159 --> 00:20:25,350
these things happened which is not a bad
thing because it means that you have to

1216
00:20:25,350 --> 00:20:25,360
thing because it means that you have to
 

1217
00:20:25,360 --> 00:20:27,029
thing because it means that you have to
go out and do some experiments and try

1218
00:20:27,029 --> 00:20:27,039
go out and do some experiments and try
 

1219
00:20:27,039 --> 00:20:28,710
go out and do some experiments and try
and demonstrate that it's possible or

1220
00:20:28,710 --> 00:20:28,720
and demonstrate that it's possible or
 

1221
00:20:28,720 --> 00:20:32,310
and demonstrate that it's possible or
not possible it's so

1222
00:20:32,310 --> 00:20:32,320
not possible it's so
 

1223
00:20:32,320 --> 00:20:34,390
not possible it's so
freaking amazing

1224
00:20:34,390 --> 00:20:34,400
freaking amazing
 

1225
00:20:34,400 --> 00:20:37,350
freaking amazing
that it happened though

1226
00:20:37,350 --> 00:20:37,360
that it happened though
 

1227
00:20:37,360 --> 00:20:39,029
that it happened though
it feels

1228
00:20:39,029 --> 00:20:39,039
it feels
 

1229
00:20:39,039 --> 00:20:41,830
it feels
like there's a direction to the thing

1230
00:20:41,830 --> 00:20:41,840
like there's a direction to the thing
 

1231
00:20:41,840 --> 00:20:43,750
like there's a direction to the thing
can you try to

1232
00:20:43,750 --> 00:20:43,760
can you try to
 

1233
00:20:43,760 --> 00:20:45,909
can you try to
answer

1234
00:20:45,909 --> 00:20:45,919
answer
 

1235
00:20:45,919 --> 00:20:48,870
answer
from a framework perspective of what is

1236
00:20:48,870 --> 00:20:48,880
from a framework perspective of what is
 

1237
00:20:48,880 --> 00:20:50,950
from a framework perspective of what is
life

1238
00:20:50,950 --> 00:20:50,960
life
 

1239
00:20:50,960 --> 00:20:53,430
life
so you said there's some order

1240
00:20:53,430 --> 00:20:53,440
so you said there's some order
 

1241
00:20:53,440 --> 00:20:54,470
so you said there's some order
and yet

1242
00:20:54,470 --> 00:20:54,480
and yet
 

1243
00:20:54,480 --> 00:20:57,110
and yet
there's complexity

1244
00:20:57,110 --> 00:20:57,120
there's complexity
 

1245
00:20:57,120 --> 00:20:59,350
there's complexity
so it's not perfectly ordered it's not

1246
00:20:59,350 --> 00:20:59,360
so it's not perfectly ordered it's not
 

1247
00:20:59,360 --> 00:21:02,070
so it's not perfectly ordered it's not
boring there's still some fun in it and

1248
00:21:02,070 --> 00:21:02,080
boring there's still some fun in it and
 

1249
00:21:02,080 --> 00:21:04,310
boring there's still some fun in it and
it also feels like the processes have a

1250
00:21:04,310 --> 00:21:04,320
it also feels like the processes have a
 

1251
00:21:04,320 --> 00:21:06,230
it also feels like the processes have a
direction

1252
00:21:06,230 --> 00:21:06,240
direction
 

1253
00:21:06,240 --> 00:21:07,990
direction
through the selection mechanism they

1254
00:21:07,990 --> 00:21:08,000
through the selection mechanism they
 

1255
00:21:08,000 --> 00:21:09,110
through the selection mechanism they
seem to be

1256
00:21:09,110 --> 00:21:09,120
seem to be
 

1257
00:21:09,120 --> 00:21:11,909
seem to be
building something always better

1258
00:21:11,909 --> 00:21:11,919
building something always better
 

1259
00:21:11,919 --> 00:21:14,950
building something always better
always improving i mean maybe it's i

1260
00:21:14,950 --> 00:21:14,960
always improving i mean maybe it's i
 

1261
00:21:14,960 --> 00:21:16,710
always improving i mean maybe it's i
mean that's a perception that's our

1262
00:21:16,710 --> 00:21:16,720
mean that's a perception that's our
 

1263
00:21:16,720 --> 00:21:18,870
mean that's a perception that's our
romanticization of things are always

1264
00:21:18,870 --> 00:21:18,880
romanticization of things are always
 

1265
00:21:18,880 --> 00:21:20,549
romanticization of things are always
better

1266
00:21:20,549 --> 00:21:20,559
better
 

1267
00:21:20,559 --> 00:21:21,909
better
things are getting better we'd like to

1268
00:21:21,909 --> 00:21:21,919
things are getting better we'd like to
 

1269
00:21:21,919 --> 00:21:23,669
things are getting better we'd like to
believe that i mean you think about the

1270
00:21:23,669 --> 00:21:23,679
believe that i mean you think about the
 

1271
00:21:23,679 --> 00:21:25,510
believe that i mean you think about the
world from the point of view of bacteria

1272
00:21:25,510 --> 00:21:25,520
world from the point of view of bacteria
 

1273
00:21:25,520 --> 00:21:27,029
world from the point of view of bacteria
and bacteria are the first things to

1274
00:21:27,029 --> 00:21:27,039
and bacteria are the first things to
 

1275
00:21:27,039 --> 00:21:28,950
and bacteria are the first things to
emerge from whatever environment they

1276
00:21:28,950 --> 00:21:28,960
emerge from whatever environment they
 

1277
00:21:28,960 --> 00:21:31,430
emerge from whatever environment they
came from and they dominated the planet

1278
00:21:31,430 --> 00:21:31,440
came from and they dominated the planet
 

1279
00:21:31,440 --> 00:21:33,430
came from and they dominated the planet
very very quickly and they haven't

1280
00:21:33,430 --> 00:21:33,440
very very quickly and they haven't
 

1281
00:21:33,440 --> 00:21:35,350
very very quickly and they haven't
really changed four billion years later

1282
00:21:35,350 --> 00:21:35,360
really changed four billion years later
 

1283
00:21:35,360 --> 00:21:37,270
really changed four billion years later
they look exactly the same so about four

1284
00:21:37,270 --> 00:21:37,280
they look exactly the same so about four
 

1285
00:21:37,280 --> 00:21:38,630
they look exactly the same so about four
billion years ago

1286
00:21:38,630 --> 00:21:38,640
billion years ago
 

1287
00:21:38,640 --> 00:21:40,710
billion years ago
bacteria started to

1288
00:21:40,710 --> 00:21:40,720
bacteria started to
 

1289
00:21:40,720 --> 00:21:42,390
bacteria started to
to really run the show

1290
00:21:42,390 --> 00:21:42,400
to really run the show
 

1291
00:21:42,400 --> 00:21:43,270
to really run the show
and then

1292
00:21:43,270 --> 00:21:43,280
and then
 

1293
00:21:43,280 --> 00:21:44,870
and then
nothing happened for a while nothing

1294
00:21:44,870 --> 00:21:44,880
nothing happened for a while nothing
 

1295
00:21:44,880 --> 00:21:47,029
nothing happened for a while nothing
happened for two billion years yep then

1296
00:21:47,029 --> 00:21:47,039
happened for two billion years yep then
 

1297
00:21:47,039 --> 00:21:48,789
happened for two billion years yep then
after two billion years we see another

1298
00:21:48,789 --> 00:21:48,799
after two billion years we see another
 

1299
00:21:48,799 --> 00:21:51,590
after two billion years we see another
single event origin if you like of of

1300
00:21:51,590 --> 00:21:51,600
single event origin if you like of of
 

1301
00:21:51,600 --> 00:21:53,750
single event origin if you like of of
our own type of cell the eukaryotic cell

1302
00:21:53,750 --> 00:21:53,760

biologists could not agree about that so

1462
00:24:31,350 --> 00:24:31,360
biologists could not agree about that so
 

1463
00:24:31,360 --> 00:24:32,950
biologists could not agree about that so
then what about a jumping gene a retro

1464
00:24:32,950 --> 00:24:32,960
then what about a jumping gene a retro
 

1465
00:24:32,960 --> 00:24:34,070
then what about a jumping gene a retro
element or something like this even

1466
00:24:34,070 --> 00:24:34,080
element or something like this even
 

1467
00:24:34,080 --> 00:24:38,870
element or something like this even
simpler than a virus but it's capable of

1468
00:24:38,870 --> 00:24:38,880
simpler than a virus but it's capable of
 

1469
00:24:38,880 --> 00:24:40,870
simpler than a virus but it's capable of
converting its environment into a copy

1470
00:24:40,870 --> 00:24:40,880
converting its environment into a copy
 

1471
00:24:40,880 --> 00:24:42,950
converting its environment into a copy
of itself

1472
00:24:42,950 --> 00:24:42,960
of itself
 

1473
00:24:42,960 --> 00:24:44,470
of itself
and that's about as close it's not a

1474
00:24:44,470 --> 00:24:44,480
and that's about as close it's not a
 

1475
00:24:44,480 --> 00:24:45,750
and that's about as close it's not a
definition but this is a kind of a

1476
00:24:45,750 --> 00:24:45,760
definition but this is a kind of a
 

1477
00:24:45,760 --> 00:24:47,350
definition but this is a kind of a
description of life

1478
00:24:47,350 --> 00:24:47,360
description of life
 

1479
00:24:47,360 --> 00:24:50,310
description of life
is that it's it's able to

1480
00:24:50,310 --> 00:24:50,320
is that it's it's able to
 

1481
00:24:50,320 --> 00:24:52,310
is that it's it's able to
parasitize the environment and that goes

1482
00:24:52,310 --> 00:24:52,320
parasitize the environment and that goes
 

1483
00:24:52,320 --> 00:24:54,070
parasitize the environment and that goes
for plants as well as animals and

1484
00:24:54,070 --> 00:24:54,080
for plants as well as animals and
 

1485
00:24:54,080 --> 00:24:56,310
for plants as well as animals and
bacteria and viruses

1486
00:24:56,310 --> 00:24:56,320
bacteria and viruses
 

1487
00:24:56,320 --> 00:25:00,549
bacteria and viruses
um to make a a relatively exact copy of

1488
00:25:00,549 --> 00:25:00,559
um to make a a relatively exact copy of
 

1489
00:25:00,559 --> 00:25:03,350
um to make a a relatively exact copy of
themselves informationally exact copy of

1490
00:25:03,350 --> 00:25:03,360
themselves informationally exact copy of
 

1491
00:25:03,360 --> 00:25:04,789
themselves informationally exact copy of
themselves by the way it doesn't really

1492
00:25:04,789 --> 00:25:04,799
themselves by the way it doesn't really
 

1493
00:25:04,799 --> 00:25:06,070
themselves by the way it doesn't really
have to be

1494
00:25:06,070 --> 00:25:06,080
have to be
 

1495
00:25:06,080 --> 00:25:08,549
have to be
a copy of itself right it just has to be

1496
00:25:08,549 --> 00:25:08,559
a copy of itself right it just has to be
 

1497
00:25:08,559 --> 00:25:11,510
a copy of itself right it just has to be
you have to create something

1498
00:25:11,510 --> 00:25:11,520
you have to create something
 

1499
00:25:11,520 --> 00:25:14,070
you have to create something
that's interesting

1500
00:25:14,070 --> 00:25:14,080
that's interesting
 

1501
00:25:14,080 --> 00:25:16,310
that's interesting
the way evolution is

1502
00:25:16,310 --> 00:25:16,320
the way evolution is
 

1503
00:25:16,320 --> 00:25:19,269
the way evolution is
so it is extremely powerful process of

1504
00:25:19,269 --> 00:25:19,279
so it is extremely powerful process of
 

1505
00:25:19,279 --> 00:25:21,350
so it is extremely powerful process of
evolution which is basically make a copy

1506
00:25:21,350 --> 00:25:21,360
evolution which is basically make a copy
 

1507
00:25:21,360 --> 00:25:24,070
evolution which is basically make a copy
yourself and sometimes mess up a little

1508
00:25:24,070 --> 00:25:24,080
yourself and sometimes mess up a little
 

1509
00:25:24,080 --> 00:25:26,310
yourself and sometimes mess up a little
bit okay that seems to work really well

1510
00:25:26,310 --> 00:25:26,320
bit okay that seems to work really well
 

1511
00:25:26,320 --> 00:25:28,390
bit okay that seems to work really well
i wonder if it's possible to

1512
00:25:28,390 --> 00:25:28,400
i wonder if it's possible to
 

1513
00:25:28,400 --> 00:25:30,549
i wonder if it's possible to
mess up big time mess up big time as a

1514
00:25:30,549 --> 00:25:30,559
mess up big time mess up big time as a
 

1515
00:25:30,559 --> 00:25:32,390
mess up big time mess up big time as a
standard that's the default uh it's

1516
00:25:32,390 --> 00:25:32,400
standard that's the default uh it's
 

1517
00:25:32,400 --> 00:25:34,470
standard that's the default uh it's
called the hopeful monster and you know

1518
00:25:34,470 --> 00:25:34,480
called the hopeful monster and you know
 

1519
00:25:34,480 --> 00:25:35,830
called the hopeful monster and you know
this doesn't work

1520
00:25:35,830 --> 00:25:35,840
this doesn't work
 

1521
00:25:35,840 --> 00:25:37,669
this doesn't work
in principle it can actually it turns

1522
00:25:37,669 --> 00:25:37,679
in principle it can actually it turns
 

1523
00:25:37,679 --> 00:25:40,549
in principle it can actually it turns
out i would say that this is due a

1524
00:25:40,549 --> 00:25:40,559
out i would say that this is due a
 

1525
00:25:40,559 --> 00:25:43,110
out i would say that this is due a
re-emergence this is some amazing work

1526
00:25:43,110 --> 00:25:43,120
re-emergence this is some amazing work
 

1527
00:25:43,120 --> 00:25:44,549
re-emergence this is some amazing work
from michael levine i don't know if you

uh andre kapathi is a friend who's

1544
00:26:02,549 --> 00:26:02,559
uh andre kapathi is a friend who's
 

1545
00:26:02,559 --> 00:26:04,710
uh andre kapathi is a friend who's
really admired in the ai community said

1546
00:26:04,710 --> 00:26:04,720
really admired in the ai community said
 

1547
00:26:04,720 --> 00:26:07,190
really admired in the ai community said
you absolutely must talk

1548
00:26:07,190 --> 00:26:07,200
you absolutely must talk
 

1549
00:26:07,200 --> 00:26:09,909
you absolutely must talk
to to michael and to nick this is so

1550
00:26:09,909 --> 00:26:09,919
to to michael and to nick this is so
 

1551
00:26:09,919 --> 00:26:11,750
to to michael and to nick this is so
this of course i'm a huge fan of yours

1552
00:26:11,750 --> 00:26:11,760
this of course i'm a huge fan of yours
 

1553
00:26:11,760 --> 00:26:13,830
this of course i'm a huge fan of yours
so i'm really fortunate that we can

1554
00:26:13,830 --> 00:26:13,840
so i'm really fortunate that we can
 

1555
00:26:13,840 --> 00:26:15,990
so i'm really fortunate that we can
actually make this happen anyway

1556
00:26:15,990 --> 00:26:16,000
actually make this happen anyway
 

1557
00:26:16,000 --> 00:26:18,789
actually make this happen anyway
well michael levin is doing amazing work

1558
00:26:18,789 --> 00:26:18,799
well michael levin is doing amazing work
 

1559
00:26:18,799 --> 00:26:21,029
well michael levin is doing amazing work
uh basically about the way in which

1560
00:26:21,029 --> 00:26:21,039
uh basically about the way in which
 

1561
00:26:21,039 --> 00:26:24,630
uh basically about the way in which
electrical fields control development um

1562
00:26:24,630 --> 00:26:24,640
electrical fields control development um
 

1563
00:26:24,640 --> 00:26:26,149
electrical fields control development um
and he's done some work with planarian

1564
00:26:26,149 --> 00:26:26,159
and he's done some work with planarian
 

1565
00:26:26,159 --> 00:26:28,710
and he's done some work with planarian
worms so flatworms well he'll tell you

1566
00:26:28,710 --> 00:26:28,720
worms so flatworms well he'll tell you
 

1567
00:26:28,720 --> 00:26:30,149
worms so flatworms well he'll tell you
all about this so i won't say any more

1568
00:26:30,149 --> 00:26:30,159
all about this so i won't say any more
 

1569
00:26:30,159 --> 00:26:31,590
all about this so i won't say any more
than the minimum but basically you can

1570
00:26:31,590 --> 00:26:31,600
than the minimum but basically you can
 

1571
00:26:31,600 --> 00:26:33,029
than the minimum but basically you can
cut their head off and they'll redevelop

1572
00:26:33,029 --> 00:26:33,039
cut their head off and they'll redevelop
 

1573
00:26:33,039 --> 00:26:34,149
cut their head off and they'll redevelop
a different

1574
00:26:34,149 --> 00:26:34,159
a different
 

1575
00:26:34,159 --> 00:26:36,630
a different
a new head but the head that they

1576
00:26:36,630 --> 00:26:36,640
a new head but the head that they
 

1577
00:26:36,640 --> 00:26:38,549
a new head but the head that they
develop depends if you knock out just

1578
00:26:38,549 --> 00:26:38,559
develop depends if you knock out just
 

1579
00:26:38,559 --> 00:26:39,350
develop depends if you knock out just
one

1580
00:26:39,350 --> 00:26:39,360
one
 

1581
00:26:39,360 --> 00:26:40,470
one
um

1582
00:26:40,470 --> 00:26:40,480
um
 

1583
00:26:40,480 --> 00:26:42,789
um
one one iron pump in a membrane so you

1584
00:26:42,789 --> 00:26:42,799
one one iron pump in a membrane so you
 

1585
00:26:42,799 --> 00:26:44,710
one one iron pump in a membrane so you
change the electrical circuitry just a

1586
00:26:44,710 --> 00:26:44,720
change the electrical circuitry just a
 

1587
00:26:44,720 --> 00:26:45,990
change the electrical circuitry just a
little bit you can come up with a

1588
00:26:45,990 --> 00:26:46,000
little bit you can come up with a
 

1589
00:26:46,000 --> 00:26:47,430
little bit you can come up with a
completely different head it can be a

1590
00:26:47,430 --> 00:26:47,440
completely different head it can be a
 

1591
00:26:47,440 --> 00:26:49,990
completely different head it can be a
head which is similar to those that

1592
00:26:49,990 --> 00:26:50,000
head which is similar to those that
 

1593
00:26:50,000 --> 00:26:52,310
head which is similar to those that
diverged 150 million years ago or it can

1594
00:26:52,310 --> 00:26:52,320
diverged 150 million years ago or it can
 

1595
00:26:52,320 --> 00:26:53,750
diverged 150 million years ago or it can
be a head which no one's ever seen

1596
00:26:53,750 --> 00:26:53,760
be a head which no one's ever seen
 

1597
00:26:53,760 --> 00:26:56,630
be a head which no one's ever seen
before a different kind of of head um

1598
00:26:56,630 --> 00:26:56,640
before a different kind of of head um
 

1599
00:26:56,640 --> 00:26:58,470
before a different kind of of head um
now that is really you might say a

1600
00:26:58,470 --> 00:26:58,480
now that is really you might say a
 

1601
00:26:58,480 --> 00:27:00,549
now that is really you might say a
hopeful monster this is a kind of leap

1602
00:27:00,549 --> 00:27:00,559
hopeful monster this is a kind of leap
 

1603
00:27:00,559 --> 00:27:02,310
hopeful monster this is a kind of leap
into a different direction the only

1604
00:27:02,310 --> 00:27:02,320
into a different direction the only
 

1605
00:27:02,320 --> 00:27:04,549
into a different direction the only
question for natural selection is does

1606
00:27:04,549 --> 00:27:04,559
question for natural selection is does
 

1607
00:27:04,559 --> 00:27:06,630
question for natural selection is does
it work is the change itself

1608
00:27:06,630 --> 00:27:06,640
it work is the change itself
 

1609
00:27:06,640 --> 00:27:08,149
it work is the change itself
feasible as a single change and the

1610
00:27:08,149 --> 00:27:08,159
feasible as a single change and the
 

1611
00:27:08,159 --> 00:27:09,669
feasible as a single change and the
answer is yes it's just a small change

1612
00:27:09,669 --> 00:27:09,679
answer is yes it's just a small change
 

1613
00:27:09,679 --> 00:27:11,909
answer is yes it's just a small change
to a single gene and the second thing is

1614
00:27:11,909 --> 00:27:11,919
to a single gene and the second thing is
 

1615
00:27:11,919 --> 00:27:13,750
to a single gene and the second thing is
it gives rise to a completely different

1616
00:27:13,750 --> 00:27:13,760
it gives rise to a completely different
 

1617
00:27:13,760 --> 00:27:17,029
it gives rise to a completely different
morphology does it work and if it works

1618
00:27:17,029 --> 00:27:17,039
morphology does it work and if it works
 

1619
00:27:17,039 --> 00:27:18,669
morphology does it work and if it works
that can easily be

1620
00:27:18,669 --> 00:27:18,679
that can easily be
 

1621
00:27:18,679 --> 00:27:20,470
that can easily be
a shift

1622
00:27:20,470 --> 00:27:20,480
a shift
 

1623
00:27:20,480 --> 00:27:23,190
a shift
it but for it to be a speciation for it

1624
00:27:23,190 --> 00:27:23,200
it but for it to be a speciation for it
 

1625
00:27:23,200 --> 00:27:24,149
it but for it to be a speciation for it
to

1626
00:27:24,149 --> 00:27:24,159
to
 

1627
00:27:24,159 --> 00:27:27,190
to
to continue for it to to give rise to a

1628
00:27:27,190 --> 00:27:27,200
to continue for it to to give rise to a
 

1629
00:27:27,200 --> 00:27:29,669
to continue for it to to give rise to a
different morphology over time

1630
00:27:29,669 --> 00:27:29,679
different morphology over time
 

1631
00:27:29,679 --> 00:27:32,789
different morphology over time
then it has to be perpetuated so that

1632
00:27:32,789 --> 00:27:32,799
then it has to be perpetuated so that
 

1633
00:27:32,799 --> 00:27:35,110
then it has to be perpetuated so that
shift that change in the

1634
00:27:35,110 --> 00:27:35,120
shift that change in the
 

1635
00:27:35,120 --> 00:27:37,190
shift that change in the
in in that one gene

1636
00:27:37,190 --> 00:27:37,200
in in that one gene
 

1637
00:27:37,200 --> 00:27:39,269
in in that one gene
has to work well enough that it is

1638
00:27:39,269 --> 00:27:39,279
has to work well enough that it is
 

1639
00:27:39,279 --> 00:27:41,669
has to work well enough that it is
selected and it goes on and copied

1640
00:27:41,669 --> 00:27:41,679
selected and it goes on and copied
 

1641
00:27:41,679 --> 00:27:43,350
selected and it goes on and copied
enough times to where you can really

1642
00:27:43,350 --> 00:27:43,360
enough times to where you can really
 

1643
00:27:43,360 --> 00:27:45,430
enough times to where you can really
test it and so the likelihood it would

1644
00:27:45,430 --> 00:27:45,440
test it and so the likelihood it would
 

1645
00:27:45,440 --> 00:27:47,110
test it and so the likelihood it would
be lost but but there will be some

1646
00:27:47,110 --> 00:27:47,120
be lost but but there will be some
 

1647
00:27:47,120 --> 00:27:49,269
be lost but but there will be some
occasions where it survives and yes the

1648
00:27:49,269 --> 00:27:49,279
occasions where it survives and yes the
 

1649
00:27:49,279 --> 00:27:51,269
occasions where it survives and yes the
idea that we can have sudden fairly

1650
00:27:51,269 --> 00:27:51,279
idea that we can have sudden fairly
 

1651
00:27:51,279 --> 00:27:53,430
idea that we can have sudden fairly
abrupt changes in evolution i think it's

1652
00:27:53,430 --> 00:27:53,440
abrupt changes in evolution i think it's
 

1653
00:27:53,440 --> 00:27:56,230
abrupt changes in evolution i think it's
time for a rebirth what about this idea

1654
00:27:56,230 --> 00:27:56,240
time for a rebirth what about this idea
 

1655
00:27:56,240 --> 00:27:57,430
time for a rebirth what about this idea
that

1656
00:27:57,430 --> 00:27:57,440
that
 

1657
00:27:57,440 --> 00:27:58,710
that
kind of trying to

1658
00:27:58,710 --> 00:27:58,720
kind of trying to
 

1659
00:27:58,720 --> 00:28:00,149
kind of trying to
mathematize

1660
00:28:00,149 --> 00:28:00,159
mathematize
 

1661
00:28:00,159 --> 00:28:02,950
mathematize
a definition of life and saying how many

00:28:02,950 --> 00:28:02,960
a definition of life and saying how many
 

1663
00:28:02,960 --> 00:28:04,389
a definition of life and saying how many
steps

1664
00:28:04,389 --> 00:28:04,399
steps
 

1665
00:28:04,399 --> 00:28:06,070
steps
the shortest amount of steps it takes to

1666
00:28:06,070 --> 00:28:06,080
the shortest amount of steps it takes to
 

1667
00:28:06,080 --> 00:28:07,430
the shortest amount of steps it takes to
build the thing almost like an

00:28:07,430 --> 00:28:07,440
build the thing almost like an

engineering view of it

1670
00:28:10,149 --> 00:28:10,159
engineering view of it
 

1671
00:28:10,159 --> 00:28:11,430
engineering view of it
i like that view

1672
00:28:11,430 --> 00:28:11,440
i like that view
 

1673
00:28:11,440 --> 00:28:13,269
i like that view
um because i think that in a sense

1674
00:28:13,269 --> 00:28:13,279
um because i think that in a sense
 

1675
00:28:13,279 --> 00:28:15,350
um because i think that in a sense
that's not very far away from what it

1676
00:28:15,350 --> 00:28:15,360
that's not very far away from what it
 

1677
00:28:15,360 --> 00:28:17,190
that's not very far away from what it
what what what a hypothesis needs to do

1678
00:28:17,190 --> 00:28:17,200
what what what a hypothesis needs to do
 

1679
00:28:17,200 --> 00:28:18,789
what what what a hypothesis needs to do
to be a testable hypothesis for the

00:28:18,789 --> 00:28:18,799
to be a testable hypothesis for the
 

1681
00:28:18,799 --> 00:28:20,310
to be a testable hypothesis for the
origin of life you need to spell out

1682
00:28:20,310 --> 00:28:20,320
origin of life you need to spell out
 

1683
00:28:20,320 --> 00:28:22,470
origin of life you need to spell out
here's here's each step

1684
00:28:22,470 --> 00:28:22,480
here's here's each step
 

1685
00:28:22,480 --> 00:28:23,990
here's here's each step
and here's the experiment to do for each

1686
00:28:23,990 --> 00:28:24,000
and here's the experiment to do for each
 

1687
00:28:24,000 --> 00:28:24,870
and here's the experiment to do for each

the idea that we can do it in the lab
 

1691
00:28:26,799 --> 00:28:28,630
the idea that we can do it in the lab
some people say oh well i've you know

1692
00:28:28,630 --> 00:28:28,640
some people say oh well i've you know
 

1693
00:28:28,640 --> 00:28:30,230
some people say oh well i've you know
we'll have created life within five

1694
00:28:30,230 --> 00:28:30,240
we'll have created life within five
 

1695
00:28:30,240 --> 00:28:31,590
we'll have created life within five
years but you know ask them what they

1696
00:28:31,590 --> 00:28:31,600
years but you know ask them what they
 

1697
00:28:31,600 --> 00:28:32,789
years but you know ask them what they
mean by life

1698
00:28:32,789 --> 00:28:32,799
mean by life
 

1699
00:28:32,799 --> 00:28:34,470
mean by life
um

1700
00:28:34,470 --> 00:28:34,480
um
 

1701
00:28:34,480 --> 00:28:36,549
um
we have a planet four billion years ago

1702
00:28:36,549 --> 00:28:36,559
we have a planet four billion years ago
 

1703
00:28:36,559 --> 00:28:38,389
we have a planet four billion years ago
with these vent systems across the

1704
00:28:38,389 --> 00:28:38,399
with these vent systems across the
 

1705
00:28:38,399 --> 00:28:40,549
with these vent systems across the
entire surface of the planet and we have

1706
00:28:40,549 --> 00:28:40,559
entire surface of the planet and we have
 

1707
00:28:40,559 --> 00:28:42,070
entire surface of the planet and we have
millions of years if we wanted i have a

1708
00:28:42,070 --> 00:28:42,080
millions of years if we wanted i have a
 

1709
00:28:42,080 --> 00:28:43,269
millions of years if we wanted i have a
feeling that we're not talking about

1710
00:28:43,269 --> 00:28:43,279
feeling that we're not talking about
 

1711
00:28:43,279 --> 00:28:44,710
feeling that we're not talking about
millions of years i have a feeling we're

1712
00:28:44,710 --> 00:28:44,720
millions of years i have a feeling we're
 

1713
00:28:44,720 --> 00:28:47,029
millions of years i have a feeling we're
talking about

1714
00:28:47,029 --> 00:28:47,039
talking about
 

1715
00:28:47,039 --> 00:28:48,710
talking about
maybe millions of nanoseconds or

1716
00:28:48,710 --> 00:28:48,720
maybe millions of nanoseconds or
 

1717
00:28:48,720 --> 00:28:49,909
maybe millions of nanoseconds or
picoseconds we're talking about

1718
00:28:49,909 --> 00:28:49,919
picoseconds we're talking about
 

1719
00:28:49,919 --> 00:28:53,750
picoseconds we're talking about
chemistry which is happening quickly

1720
00:28:53,750 --> 00:28:53,760
chemistry which is happening quickly
 

1721
00:28:53,760 --> 00:28:56,230
chemistry which is happening quickly
but we still need to constrain those

1722
00:28:56,230 --> 00:28:56,240
but we still need to constrain those
 

1723
00:28:56,240 --> 00:28:59,110
but we still need to constrain those
steps but we've got a you know a planet

1724
00:28:59,110 --> 00:28:59,120
steps but we've got a you know a planet
 

1725
00:28:59,120 --> 00:29:01,110
steps but we've got a you know a planet
uh doing similar chemistry you asked

1726
00:29:01,110 --> 00:29:01,120
uh doing similar chemistry you asked
 

1727
00:29:01,120 --> 00:29:03,750
uh doing similar chemistry you asked
about a trajectory the trajectory is the

1728
00:29:03,750 --> 00:29:03,760
about a trajectory the trajectory is the
 

1729
00:29:03,760 --> 00:29:05,909
about a trajectory the trajectory is the
planetary trajectory the planet has

1730
00:29:05,909 --> 00:29:05,919
planetary trajectory the planet has
 

1731
00:29:05,919 --> 00:29:07,350
planetary trajectory the planet has
properties it's basically it's got a lot

1732
00:29:07,350 --> 00:29:07,360
properties it's basically it's got a lot
 

1733
00:29:07,360 --> 00:29:08,789
properties it's basically it's got a lot
of iron at the center of it it's got a

1734
00:29:08,789 --> 00:29:08,799
of iron at the center of it it's got a
 

1735
00:29:08,799 --> 00:29:10,389
of iron at the center of it it's got a
lot of electrons at the center of it

1736
00:29:10,389 --> 00:29:10,399
lot of electrons at the center of it
 

1737
00:29:10,399 --> 00:29:12,149
lot of electrons at the center of it
it's more oxidized on the outside partly

1738
00:29:12,149 --> 00:29:12,159
it's more oxidized on the outside partly
 

1739
00:29:12,159 --> 00:29:14,630
it's more oxidized on the outside partly
because of the sun and partly because

1740
00:29:14,630 --> 00:29:14,640
because of the sun and partly because
 

1741
00:29:14,640 --> 00:29:16,870
because of the sun and partly because
the heat of volcanoes puts out oxidized

1742
00:29:16,870 --> 00:29:16,880
the heat of volcanoes puts out oxidized
 

1743
00:29:16,880 --> 00:29:18,310
the heat of volcanoes puts out oxidized
gases so

1744
00:29:18,310 --> 00:29:18,320
gases so
 

1745
00:29:18,320 --> 00:29:19,990
gases so
the planet is a battery it's a giant

1746
00:29:19,990 --> 00:29:20,000
the planet is a battery it's a giant
 

1747
00:29:20,000 --> 00:29:21,669
the planet is a battery it's a giant
battery um

1748
00:29:21,669 --> 00:29:21,679
battery um
 

1749
00:29:21,679 --> 00:29:23,430
battery um
and we have a flow of electrons going

1750
00:29:23,430 --> 00:29:23,440
and we have a flow of electrons going
 

1751
00:29:23,440 --> 00:29:25,110
and we have a flow of electrons going
from inside to outside in these

1752
00:29:25,110 --> 00:29:25,120
from inside to outside in these
 

1753
00:29:25,120 --> 00:29:26,870
from inside to outside in these
hydrothermal vents and that's the same

1754
00:29:26,870 --> 00:29:26,880
hydrothermal vents and that's the same
 

1755
00:29:26,880 --> 00:29:29,590
hydrothermal vents and that's the same
topology that a cell has a cell is

1756
00:29:29,590 --> 00:29:29,600
topology that a cell has a cell is
 

1757
00:29:29,600 --> 00:29:32,149
topology that a cell has a cell is
basically just a micro version of the

1758
00:29:32,149 --> 00:29:32,159
basically just a micro version of the
 

1759
00:29:32,159 --> 00:29:33,990
basically just a micro version of the
planet um

1760
00:29:33,990 --> 00:29:34,000
planet um
 

1761
00:29:34,000 --> 00:29:35,269
planet um
and it's uh

1762
00:29:35,269 --> 00:29:35,279
and it's uh
 

1763
00:29:35,279 --> 00:29:37,110
and it's uh
there is a trajectory in all of that and

1764
00:29:37,110 --> 00:29:37,120
there is a trajectory in all of that and
 

1765
00:29:37,120 --> 00:29:38,870
there is a trajectory in all of that and
there's an inevitability that certain

1766
00:29:38,870 --> 00:29:38,880
there's an inevitability that certain
 

1767
00:29:38,880 --> 00:29:40,630
there's an inevitability that certain
types of chemical reaction are going to

1768
00:29:40,630 --> 00:29:40,640
types of chemical reaction are going to
 

1769
00:29:40,640 --> 00:29:42,710
types of chemical reaction are going to
be favored over others and there's an

1770
00:29:42,710 --> 00:29:42,720
be favored over others and there's an
 

1771
00:29:42,720 --> 00:29:44,789
be favored over others and there's an
inevitability in

1772
00:29:44,789 --> 00:29:44,799
inevitability in
 

1773
00:29:44,799 --> 00:29:46,630
inevitability in
in what happens in water the chemistry

1774
00:29:46,630 --> 00:29:46,640
in what happens in water the chemistry
 

1775
00:29:46,640 --> 00:29:49,029
in what happens in water the chemistry
that happens in water some

1776
00:29:49,029 --> 00:29:49,039
that happens in water some
 

1777
00:29:49,039 --> 00:29:50,789
that happens in water some
some will be miscible with water and

1778
00:29:50,789 --> 00:29:50,799
some will be miscible with water and
 

1779
00:29:50,799 --> 00:29:52,149
some will be miscible with water and
will form membranes and will form

1780
00:29:52,149 --> 00:29:52,159
will form membranes and will form
 

1781
00:29:52,159 --> 00:29:53,909
will form membranes and will form
insoluble structures and you know

1782
00:29:53,909 --> 00:29:53,919
insoluble structures and you know

well
 

1789
00:29:57,600 --> 00:30:00,549
well
um and it's uh it's another big question

1790
00:30:00,549 --> 00:30:00,559
um and it's uh it's another big question
 

1791
00:30:00,559 --> 00:30:02,149
um and it's uh it's another big question
for experiments on the origin of life

00:30:02,149 --> 00:30:02,159
for experiments on the origin of life

what do you put it in

1794
00:30:04,310 --> 00:30:04,320
what do you put it in
 

1795
00:30:04,320 --> 00:30:05,990
what do you put it in
what kind of structure do we want to

1796
00:30:05,990 --> 00:30:06,000
what kind of structure do we want to
 

1797
00:30:06,000 --> 00:30:07,750
what kind of structure do we want to
induce in this water because the last

00:30:13,430 --> 00:30:13,440
how fundamental is water to life would
 

1805
00:30:13,440 --> 00:30:16,870
how fundamental is water to life would
you say i would say pretty fundamental

1806
00:30:16,870 --> 00:30:16,880
you say i would say pretty fundamental
 

1807
00:30:16,880 --> 00:30:17,669
you say i would say pretty fundamental
um

1808
00:30:17,669 --> 00:30:17,679
um
 

1809
00:30:17,679 --> 00:30:19,590
um
i wouldn't like to say it's impossible

1810
00:30:19,590 --> 00:30:19,600
i wouldn't like to say it's impossible
 

1811
00:30:19,600 --> 00:30:22,630
i wouldn't like to say it's impossible
for life to start any other way

00:30:22,630 --> 00:30:22,640
for life to start any other way
 

1813
00:30:22,640 --> 00:30:23,909
for life to start any other way
but

1814
00:30:23,909 --> 00:30:23,919
but
 

1815
00:30:23,919 --> 00:30:25,990
but
water is everywhere

1816
00:30:25,990 --> 00:30:26,000
water is everywhere
 

1817
00:30:26,000 --> 00:30:27,669
water is everywhere
water is extremely good at what it does

1818
00:30:27,669 --> 00:30:27,679
water is extremely good at what it does
 

1819
00:30:27,679 --> 00:30:30,070
water is extremely good at what it does
and carbon carbon works in water

00:30:30,070 --> 00:30:30,080
and carbon carbon works in water
 

1821
00:30:30,080 --> 00:30:31,830
and carbon carbon works in water
especially well so those things and

carbon is everywhere so those things
 

1825
00:30:33,840 --> 00:30:35,590
carbon is everywhere so those things
together make me think probabilistically

1826
00:30:35,590 --> 00:30:35,600
together make me think probabilistically
 

1827
00:30:35,600 --> 00:30:37,789
together make me think probabilistically
if we found a thousand life forms

1828
00:30:37,789 --> 00:30:37,799
if we found a thousand life forms
 

1829
00:30:37,799 --> 00:30:40,230
if we found a thousand life forms
995 of them would be carbon-based and

1830
00:30:40,230 --> 00:30:40,240
995 of them would be carbon-based and
 

1831
00:30:40,240 --> 00:30:41,830
995 of them would be carbon-based and
living in water

1832
00:30:41,830 --> 00:30:41,840
living in water
 

1833
00:30:41,840 --> 00:30:44,470
living in water
now the reverse question if you found a

1834
00:30:44,470 --> 00:30:44,480
now the reverse question if you found a
 

1835
00:30:44,480 --> 00:30:46,789
now the reverse question if you found a
puddle of water elsewhere and some

1836
00:30:46,789 --> 00:30:46,799
puddle of water elsewhere and some
 

1837
00:30:46,799 --> 00:30:47,909
puddle of water elsewhere and some
carbon

1838
00:30:47,909 --> 00:30:47,919
carbon
 

1839
00:30:47,919 --> 00:30:50,710
carbon
no just a puddle of water is a pot of

1840
00:30:50,710 --> 00:30:50,720
no just a puddle of water is a pot of
 

1841
00:30:50,720 --> 00:30:51,669
no just a puddle of water is a pot of

1842
00:30:51,669 --> 00:30:51,679

1843
00:30:51,679 --> 00:30:54,230
water
a pretty damn good indication that life

1844
00:30:54,230 --> 00:30:54,240
a pretty damn good indication that life
 

1845
00:30:54,240 --> 00:30:55,350
a pretty damn good indication that life
has

1846
00:30:55,350 --> 00:30:55,360
has
 

1847
00:30:55,360 --> 00:30:57,350
has
is either exists here

1848
00:30:57,350 --> 00:30:57,360
is either exists here
 

1849
00:30:57,360 --> 00:30:58,789
is either exists here
or

1850
00:30:58,789 --> 00:30:58,799
or
 

1851
00:30:58,799 --> 00:31:02,230
or
has once existed here no

1852
00:31:02,230 --> 00:31:02,240
has once existed here no
 

1853
00:31:02,240 --> 00:31:05,190
has once existed here no
so it doesn't work the other way

1854
00:31:05,190 --> 00:31:05,200
so it doesn't work the other way
 

1855
00:31:05,200 --> 00:31:07,430
so it doesn't work the other way
i think you need a living planet

1856
00:31:07,430 --> 00:31:07,440
i think you need a living planet
 

1857
00:31:07,440 --> 00:31:09,110
i think you need a living planet
you need a planet which is capable of

1858
00:31:09,110 --> 00:31:09,120
you need a planet which is capable of
 

1859
00:31:09,120 --> 00:31:11,190
you need a planet which is capable of
turning over its surface it needs to be

1860
00:31:11,190 --> 00:31:11,200
turning over its surface it needs to be
 

1861
00:31:11,200 --> 00:31:13,430
turning over its surface it needs to be
a planet with water it needs to be

1862
00:31:13,430 --> 00:31:13,440
a planet with water it needs to be
 

1863
00:31:13,440 --> 00:31:15,750
a planet with water it needs to be
capable of of

1864
00:31:15,750 --> 00:31:15,760
capable of of
 

1865
00:31:15,760 --> 00:31:17,430
capable of of
bringing those electrons from inside to

1866
00:31:17,430 --> 00:31:17,440
bringing those electrons from inside to
 

1867
00:31:17,440 --> 00:31:19,029
bringing those electrons from inside to
the outside it needs to turn over its

1868
00:31:19,029 --> 00:31:19,039
the outside it needs to turn over its
 

1869
00:31:19,039 --> 00:31:21,110
the outside it needs to turn over its
surface it needs to make that water work

1870
00:31:21,110 --> 00:31:21,120
surface it needs to make that water work
 

1871
00:31:21,120 --> 00:31:23,269
surface it needs to make that water work
and turn it into hydrogen so i think you

1872
00:31:23,269 --> 00:31:23,279
and turn it into hydrogen so i think you
 

1873
00:31:23,279 --> 00:31:25,110
and turn it into hydrogen so i think you
need a living planet but once you've got

1874
00:31:25,110 --> 00:31:25,120
need a living planet but once you've got
 

1875
00:31:25,120 --> 00:31:26,710
need a living planet but once you've got
the living planet i think the rest of it

1876
00:31:26,710 --> 00:31:26,720
the living planet i think the rest of it
 

1877
00:31:26,720 --> 00:31:29,269
the living planet i think the rest of it
uh is kind of thermodynamics all the way

1878
00:31:29,269 --> 00:31:29,279
uh is kind of thermodynamics all the way
 

1879
00:31:29,279 --> 00:31:31,509
uh is kind of thermodynamics all the way
so if you were to run earth over a

1880
00:31:31,509 --> 00:31:31,519
so if you were to run earth over a
 

1881
00:31:31,519 --> 00:31:34,149
so if you were to run earth over a
million times

1882
00:31:34,149 --> 00:31:34,159
million times
 

1883
00:31:34,159 --> 00:31:35,830
million times
up to this point

1884
00:31:35,830 --> 00:31:35,840
up to this point
 

1885
00:31:35,840 --> 00:31:38,389
up to this point
maybe beyond to the end let's run it to

1886
00:31:38,389 --> 00:31:38,399
maybe beyond to the end let's run it to
 

1887
00:31:38,399 --> 00:31:39,509
maybe beyond to the end let's run it to
the end

1888
00:31:39,509 --> 00:31:39,519
the end
 

1889
00:31:39,519 --> 00:31:42,310
the end
uh what is it uh how much variety is

1890
00:31:42,310 --> 00:31:42,320
uh what is it uh how much variety is
 

1891
00:31:42,320 --> 00:31:43,830
uh what is it uh how much variety is
there you kind of spoke to this

1892
00:31:43,830 --> 00:31:43,840
there you kind of spoke to this
 

1893
00:31:43,840 --> 00:31:48,230
there you kind of spoke to this
trajectory that the environment dictates

1894
00:31:48,230 --> 00:31:48,240
trajectory that the environment dictates
 

1895
00:31:48,240 --> 00:31:50,549
trajectory that the environment dictates
like chemically i don't know in which

00:31:50,549 --> 00:31:50,559
like chemically i don't know in which
 

1897
00:31:50,559 --> 00:31:51,669
like chemically i don't know in which
other way

1898
00:31:51,669 --> 00:31:51,679

00:31:51,679 --> 00:31:54,630
other way
um spiritually

1900
00:31:54,630 --> 00:31:54,640
um spiritually
 

1901
00:31:54,640 --> 00:31:57,029
um spiritually
like dictates kind of the direction of

1902
00:31:57,029 --> 00:31:57,039
like dictates kind of the direction of
 

1903
00:31:57,039 --> 00:32:01,750
like dictates kind of the direction of
this giant machine that seems uh chaotic

1904
00:32:01,750 --> 00:32:01,760
this giant machine that seems uh chaotic
 

1905
00:32:01,760 --> 00:32:03,909
this giant machine that seems uh chaotic
but it does seem to have order in the

1906
00:32:03,909 --> 00:32:03,919
but it does seem to have order in the
 

1907
00:32:03,919 --> 00:32:05,830
but it does seem to have order in the
steps it's taking

1908
00:32:05,830 --> 00:32:05,840
steps it's taking
 

1909
00:32:05,840 --> 00:32:07,110
steps it's taking
uh how much

1910
00:32:07,110 --> 00:32:07,120
uh how much
 

1911
00:32:07,120 --> 00:32:09,110
uh how much
how often will life

1912
00:32:09,110 --> 00:32:09,120
how often will life
 

1913
00:32:09,120 --> 00:32:11,830
how often will life
how often will bacteria emerge how often

1914
00:32:11,830 --> 00:32:11,840
how often will bacteria emerge how often
 

1915
00:32:11,840 --> 00:32:13,350
how often will bacteria emerge how often
will something like humans emerge how

1916
00:32:13,350 --> 00:32:13,360
will something like humans emerge how
 

1917
00:32:13,360 --> 00:32:15,190
will something like humans emerge how
much variety do you think there would be

1918
00:32:15,190 --> 00:32:15,200
much variety do you think there would be
 

1919
00:32:15,200 --> 00:32:17,830
much variety do you think there would be
i think at the level of bacteria

1920
00:32:17,830 --> 00:32:17,840
i think at the level of bacteria
 

1921
00:32:17,840 --> 00:32:20,789
i think at the level of bacteria
not much variety i think we would get

1922
00:32:20,789 --> 00:32:20,799
not much variety i think we would get
 

1923
00:32:20,799 --> 00:32:22,310
not much variety i think we would get
that's how many times you say you want

1924
00:32:22,310 --> 00:32:22,320
that's how many times you say you want
 

1925
00:32:22,320 --> 00:32:23,990
that's how many times you say you want
to run it a million times

1926
00:32:23,990 --> 00:32:24,000
to run it a million times
 

1927
00:32:24,000 --> 00:32:26,389
to run it a million times
um i would say at least a few hundred

1928
00:32:26,389 --> 00:32:26,399
um i would say at least a few hundred
 

1929
00:32:26,399 --> 00:32:28,630
um i would say at least a few hundred
thousand will get bacteria again oh wow

1930
00:32:28,630 --> 00:32:28,640
thousand will get bacteria again oh wow
 

1931
00:32:28,640 --> 00:32:30,549
thousand will get bacteria again oh wow
um nice because i i think there's some

1932
00:32:30,549 --> 00:32:30,559
um nice because i i think there's some
 

1933
00:32:30,559 --> 00:32:32,470
um nice because i i think there's some
level of inevitability that a wet rocky

1934
00:32:32,470 --> 00:32:32,480
level of inevitability that a wet rocky
 

1935
00:32:32,480 --> 00:32:34,950
level of inevitability that a wet rocky
planet will give rise through

1936
00:32:34,950 --> 00:32:34,960
planet will give rise through
 

1937
00:32:34,960 --> 00:32:36,789
planet will give rise through
through the same processes

1938
00:32:36,789 --> 00:32:36,799
through the same processes
 

1939
00:32:36,799 --> 00:32:39,509
through the same processes
to something very close i i think this

1940
00:32:39,509 --> 00:32:39,519
to something very close i i think this
 

1941
00:32:39,519 --> 00:32:40,549
to something very close i i think this
is not something i'd have thought a few

1942
00:32:40,549 --> 00:32:40,559
is not something i'd have thought a few
 

1943
00:32:40,559 --> 00:32:42,950
is not something i'd have thought a few
years ago but we're working with a phd

1944
00:32:42,950 --> 00:32:42,960
years ago but we're working with a phd
 

1945
00:32:42,960 --> 00:32:44,389
years ago but we're working with a phd
student of mine stuart harrison he's

1946
00:32:44,389 --> 00:32:44,399
student of mine stuart harrison he's
 

1947
00:32:44,399 --> 00:32:46,470
student of mine stuart harrison he's
been thinking about the genetic code and

1948
00:32:46,470 --> 00:32:46,480
been thinking about the genetic code and
 

1949
00:32:46,480 --> 00:32:49,110
been thinking about the genetic code and
we've just been publishing on that um

1950
00:32:49,110 --> 00:32:49,120
we've just been publishing on that um
 

1951
00:32:49,120 --> 00:32:50,950
we've just been publishing on that um
there are patterns that you can discern

1952
00:32:50,950 --> 00:32:50,960
there are patterns that you can discern
 

1953
00:32:50,960 --> 00:32:52,470
there are patterns that you can discern
in the co or he has discerned in the

1954
00:32:52,470 --> 00:32:52,480
in the co or he has discerned in the
 

1955
00:32:52,480 --> 00:32:53,350
in the co or he has discerned in the
code

1956
00:32:53,350 --> 00:32:53,360
code
 

1957
00:32:53,360 --> 00:32:55,430
code
that if you if you think about them in

1958
00:32:55,430 --> 00:32:55,440
that if you if you think about them in
 

1959
00:32:55,440 --> 00:32:57,669
that if you if you think about them in
terms of we start with co2 and hydrogen

1960
00:32:57,669 --> 00:32:57,679
terms of we start with co2 and hydrogen
 

1961
00:32:57,679 --> 00:32:58,950
terms of we start with co2 and hydrogen
and these are the first steps of

1962
00:32:58,950 --> 00:32:58,960
and these are the first steps of
 

1963
00:32:58,960 --> 00:33:00,630
and these are the first steps of
biochemistry you come up with a code

1964
00:33:00,630 --> 00:33:00,640
biochemistry you come up with a code
 

1965
00:33:00,640 --> 00:33:02,389
biochemistry you come up with a code
which is very similar to the code that

1966
00:33:02,389 --> 00:33:02,399
which is very similar to the code that
 

1967
00:33:02,399 --> 00:33:03,509
which is very similar to the code that
we see

1968
00:33:03,509 --> 00:33:03,519
we see
 

1969
00:33:03,519 --> 00:33:05,590
we see
so it wouldn't surprise me any longer if

1970
00:33:05,590 --> 00:33:05,600
so it wouldn't surprise me any longer if
 

1971
00:33:05,600 --> 00:33:07,029
so it wouldn't surprise me any longer if
we found life on mars and it had a

1972
00:33:07,029 --> 00:33:07,039
we found life on mars and it had a
 

1973
00:33:07,039 --> 00:33:08,789
we found life on mars and it had a
genetic code that was not very different

1974
00:33:08,789 --> 00:33:08,799
genetic code that was not very different
 

1975
00:33:08,799 --> 00:33:10,950
genetic code that was not very different
to the genetic code that we have here

1976
00:33:10,950 --> 00:33:10,960
to the genetic code that we have here
 

1977
00:33:10,960 --> 00:33:13,990
to the genetic code that we have here
without it just being transferred across

1978
00:33:13,990 --> 00:33:14,000
without it just being transferred across
 

1979
00:33:14,000 --> 00:33:16,070
without it just being transferred across
some inevitability about the whole of

1980
00:33:16,070 --> 00:33:16,080
some inevitability about the whole of
 

1981
00:33:16,080 --> 00:33:18,789
some inevitability about the whole of
the beginnings of life in my view that's

1982
00:33:18,789 --> 00:33:18,799
the beginnings of life in my view that's
 

1983
00:33:18,799 --> 00:33:20,389
the beginnings of life in my view that's
really promising because if the basic

1984
00:33:20,389 --> 00:33:20,399
really promising because if the basic
 

1985
00:33:20,399 --> 00:33:24,389
really promising because if the basic
chemistry is tightly linked to the

1986
00:33:24,389 --> 00:33:24,399
chemistry is tightly linked to the
 

1987
00:33:24,399 --> 00:33:25,830
chemistry is tightly linked to the
genetic code

1988
00:33:25,830 --> 00:33:25,840
genetic code
 

1989
00:33:25,840 --> 00:33:27,509
genetic code
that means

1990
00:33:27,509 --> 00:33:27,519
that means
 

1991
00:33:27,519 --> 00:33:29,669
that means
we can interact with other life if it

1992
00:33:29,669 --> 00:33:29,679
we can interact with other life if it
 

1993
00:33:29,679 --> 00:33:30,789
we can interact with other life if it
exists

1994
00:33:30,789 --> 00:33:30,799
exists
 

1995
00:33:30,799 --> 00:33:32,070
exists
potentially

1996
00:33:32,070 --> 00:33:32,080
potentially
 

1997
00:33:32,080 --> 00:33:33,830
potentially
that's that's really exciting if that's

1998
00:33:33,830 --> 00:33:33,840
that's that's really exciting if that's
 

1999
00:33:33,840 --> 00:33:35,190
that's that's really exciting if that's
if that's the case okay but then

2000
00:33:35,190 --> 00:33:35,200
if that's the case okay but then
 

2001
00:33:35,200 --> 00:33:36,950
if that's the case okay but then
bacteria we've got then we've got

2002
00:33:36,950 --> 00:33:36,960
bacteria we've got then we've got
 

2003
00:33:36,960 --> 00:33:39,350
bacteria we've got then we've got
bacteria yeah um

2004
00:33:39,350 --> 00:33:39,360
bacteria yeah um
 

2005
00:33:39,360 --> 00:33:42,789
bacteria yeah um
how easy is photosynthesis

2006
00:33:42,789 --> 00:33:42,799
how easy is photosynthesis
 

2007
00:33:42,799 --> 00:33:44,789
how easy is photosynthesis
much harder i would say

2008
00:33:44,789 --> 00:33:44,799
much harder i would say
 

2009
00:33:44,799 --> 00:33:46,310
much harder i would say
let's actually go there let's let's go

2010
00:33:46,310 --> 00:33:46,320
let's actually go there let's let's go
 

2011
00:33:46,320 --> 00:33:49,430
let's actually go there let's let's go
through the inventions yeah um what is

2012
00:33:49,430 --> 00:33:49,440
through the inventions yeah um what is
 

2013
00:33:49,440 --> 00:33:51,029
through the inventions yeah um what is
photosynthesis

2014
00:33:51,029 --> 00:33:51,039
photosynthesis
 

2015
00:33:51,039 --> 00:33:52,710
photosynthesis
and why is it hard well there are

2016
00:33:52,710 --> 00:33:52,720
and why is it hard well there are
 

2017
00:33:52,720 --> 00:33:53,909
and why is it hard well there are
different

2018
00:33:53,909 --> 00:33:53,919
different
 

2019
00:33:53,919 --> 00:33:55,190
different
forms

2020
00:33:55,190 --> 00:33:55,200
forms
 

2021
00:33:55,200 --> 00:33:57,269
forms
i mean basically you're taking hydrogen

2022
00:33:57,269 --> 00:33:57,279
i mean basically you're taking hydrogen
 

2023
00:33:57,279 --> 00:33:59,190
i mean basically you're taking hydrogen
and you're sticking it onto co2 and it's

2024
00:33:59,190 --> 00:33:59,200
and you're sticking it onto co2 and it's
 

2025
00:33:59,200 --> 00:34:00,789
and you're sticking it onto co2 and it's
powered by the sun the question is where

2026
00:34:00,789 --> 00:34:00,799
powered by the sun the question is where
 

2027
00:34:00,799 --> 00:34:02,630
powered by the sun the question is where
are you taking the hydrogen from

2028
00:34:02,630 --> 00:34:02,640
are you taking the hydrogen from
 

2029
00:34:02,640 --> 00:34:04,310
are you taking the hydrogen from
and in photosynthesis that we know in

2030
00:34:04,310 --> 00:34:04,320
and in photosynthesis that we know in
 

2031
00:34:04,320 --> 00:34:06,870
and in photosynthesis that we know in
plants it's coming from water so you're

2032
00:34:06,870 --> 00:34:06,880
plants it's coming from water so you're
 

2033
00:34:06,880 --> 00:34:08,310
plants it's coming from water so you're
using the power of the sun to split

2034
00:34:08,310 --> 00:34:08,320
using the power of the sun to split
 

2035
00:34:08,320 --> 00:34:10,149
using the power of the sun to split
water take out the hydrogen stick it

2036
00:34:10,149 --> 00:34:10,159
water take out the hydrogen stick it
 

2037
00:34:10,159 --> 00:34:12,310
water take out the hydrogen stick it
onto co2 and the oxygen is a waste

2038
00:34:12,310 --> 00:34:12,320
onto co2 and the oxygen is a waste
 

2039
00:34:12,320 --> 00:34:14,790
onto co2 and the oxygen is a waste
product and you just throw it out throw

2040
00:34:14,790 --> 00:34:14,800
product and you just throw it out throw
 

2041
00:34:14,800 --> 00:34:17,270
product and you just throw it out throw
it away so this is you know the single

2042
00:34:17,270 --> 00:34:17,280
it away so this is you know the single
 

2043
00:34:17,280 --> 00:34:19,030
it away so this is you know the single
greatest planetary pollution event in

2044
00:34:19,030 --> 00:34:19,040
greatest planetary pollution event in
 

2045
00:34:19,040 --> 00:34:21,190
greatest planetary pollution event in
the whole history of of the earth the

2046
00:34:21,190 --> 00:34:21,200
the whole history of of the earth the
 

2047
00:34:21,200 --> 00:34:23,270
the whole history of of the earth the
pollutant being oxygen yes

2048
00:34:23,270 --> 00:34:23,280
pollutant being oxygen yes
 

2049
00:34:23,280 --> 00:34:26,230
pollutant being oxygen yes
yeah it also made possible animals you

2050
00:34:26,230 --> 00:34:26,240
yeah it also made possible animals you
 

2051
00:34:26,240 --> 00:34:28,629
yeah it also made possible animals you
can't have large active animals without

2052
00:34:28,629 --> 00:34:28,639
can't have large active animals without
 

2053
00:34:28,639 --> 00:34:31,190
can't have large active animals without
an oxygenated atmosphere at least not

2054
00:34:31,190 --> 00:34:31,200
an oxygenated atmosphere at least not
 

2055
00:34:31,200 --> 00:34:33,510
an oxygenated atmosphere at least not
not in the sense that we know on earth

2056
00:34:33,510 --> 00:34:33,520
not in the sense that we know on earth
 

2057
00:34:33,520 --> 00:34:35,750
not in the sense that we know on earth
so that's a really big invention in this

2058
00:34:35,750 --> 00:34:35,760
so that's a really big invention in this
 

2059
00:34:35,760 --> 00:34:37,909
so that's a really big invention in this
huge intervention yes and it happened

2060
00:34:37,909 --> 00:34:37,919
huge intervention yes and it happened
 

2061
00:34:37,919 --> 00:34:39,510
huge intervention yes and it happened
once there's a few things that happen

2062
00:34:39,510 --> 00:34:39,520
once there's a few things that happen
 

2063
00:34:39,520 --> 00:34:41,030
once there's a few things that happen
once on earth and you know you're always

2064
00:34:41,030 --> 00:34:41,040
once on earth and you know you're always
 

2065
00:34:41,040 --> 00:34:42,869
once on earth and you know you're always
stuck with this problem is it once it

2066
00:34:42,869 --> 00:34:42,879
stuck with this problem is it once it
 

2067
00:34:42,879 --> 00:34:44,310
stuck with this problem is it once it
happened did it become so good so

2068
00:34:44,310 --> 00:34:44,320
happened did it become so good so
 

2069
00:34:44,320 --> 00:34:46,389
happened did it become so good so
quickly that it precluded the the same

2070
00:34:46,389 --> 00:34:46,399
quickly that it precluded the the same
 

2071
00:34:46,399 --> 00:34:48,790
quickly that it precluded the the same
thing happening ever again or are there

2072
00:34:48,790 --> 00:34:48,800
thing happening ever again or are there
 

2073
00:34:48,800 --> 00:34:50,149
thing happening ever again or are there
other reasons and we really have to look

2074
00:34:50,149 --> 00:34:50,159
other reasons and we really have to look
 

2075
00:34:50,159 --> 00:34:51,829
other reasons and we really have to look
at each one in turn and think

2076
00:34:51,829 --> 00:34:51,839
at each one in turn and think
 

2077
00:34:51,839 --> 00:34:52,629
at each one in turn and think
what's

2078
00:34:52,629 --> 00:34:52,639
what's
 

2079
00:34:52,639 --> 00:34:54,149
what's
why does it only happen once in this

2080
00:34:54,149 --> 00:34:54,159
why does it only happen once in this
 

2081
00:34:54,159 --> 00:34:55,030
why does it only happen once in this
case

2082
00:34:55,030 --> 00:34:55,040
case
 

2083
00:34:55,040 --> 00:34:56,550
case
it's really difficult

2084
00:34:56,550 --> 00:34:56,560
it's really difficult
 

2085
00:34:56,560 --> 00:34:58,550
it's really difficult
to split water it requires a lot of

2086
00:34:58,550 --> 00:34:58,560
to split water it requires a lot of
 

2087
00:34:58,560 --> 00:35:00,630
to split water it requires a lot of
power and that power you're effectively

2088
00:35:00,630 --> 00:35:00,640
power and that power you're effectively
 

2089
00:35:00,640 --> 00:35:02,870
power and that power you're effectively
separating charge across a membrane and

2090
00:35:02,870 --> 00:35:02,880
separating charge across a membrane and
 

2091
00:35:02,880 --> 00:35:04,470
separating charge across a membrane and
the way in which you do it if it doesn't

2092
00:35:04,470 --> 00:35:04,480
the way in which you do it if it doesn't
 

2093
00:35:04,480 --> 00:35:06,470
the way in which you do it if it doesn't
all rush back and and kind of cause an

2094
00:35:06,470 --> 00:35:06,480
all rush back and and kind of cause an
 

2095
00:35:06,480 --> 00:35:08,950
all rush back and and kind of cause an
explosion right at the site requires

2096
00:35:08,950 --> 00:35:08,960
explosion right at the site requires
 

2097
00:35:08,960 --> 00:35:13,349
explosion right at the site requires
really careful wiring um and that wiring

2098
00:35:13,349 --> 00:35:13,359
really careful wiring um and that wiring
 

2099
00:35:13,359 --> 00:35:15,510
really careful wiring um and that wiring
it can't be easy to get it right because

2100
00:35:15,510 --> 00:35:15,520
it can't be easy to get it right because
 

2101
00:35:15,520 --> 00:35:16,470
it can't be easy to get it right because
you know

2102
00:35:16,470 --> 00:35:16,480
you know
 

2103
00:35:16,480 --> 00:35:18,630
you know
the plants that we see around us they

2104
00:35:18,630 --> 00:35:18,640
the plants that we see around us they
 

2105
00:35:18,640 --> 00:35:20,069
the plants that we see around us they
have chloroplasts those chloroplasts

2106
00:35:20,069 --> 00:35:20,079
have chloroplasts those chloroplasts
 

2107
00:35:20,079 --> 00:35:21,430
have chloroplasts those chloroplasts
were cyanobacterial ones those

2108
00:35:21,430 --> 00:35:21,440
were cyanobacterial ones those
 

2109
00:35:21,440 --> 00:35:23,030
were cyanobacterial ones those
cyanobacteria are the only group of

2110
00:35:23,030 --> 00:35:23,040
cyanobacteria are the only group of
 

2111
00:35:23,040 --> 00:35:24,470
cyanobacteria are the only group of
bacteria that can do that type of

2112
00:35:24,470 --> 00:35:24,480
bacteria that can do that type of
 

2113
00:35:24,480 --> 00:35:26,950
bacteria that can do that type of
photosynthesis so there's plenty of

2114
00:35:26,950 --> 00:35:26,960
photosynthesis so there's plenty of
 

2115
00:35:26,960 --> 00:35:29,670
photosynthesis so there's plenty of
opportunity so not even many bacteria so

2116
00:35:29,670 --> 00:35:29,680
opportunity so not even many bacteria so
 

2117
00:35:29,680 --> 00:35:32,150
opportunity so not even many bacteria so
who who invented photosynthesis that the

2118
00:35:32,150 --> 00:35:32,160
who who invented photosynthesis that the
 

2119
00:35:32,160 --> 00:35:34,230
who who invented photosynthesis that the
cyanobacteria or their ancestors and

2120
00:35:34,230 --> 00:35:34,240
cyanobacteria or their ancestors and
 

2121
00:35:34,240 --> 00:35:36,870
cyanobacteria or their ancestors and
there's not many um no other bacteria

2122
00:35:36,870 --> 00:35:36,880
there's not many um no other bacteria
 

2123
00:35:36,880 --> 00:35:38,630
there's not many um no other bacteria
can do what's called oxygenic

2124
00:35:38,630 --> 00:35:38,640
can do what's called oxygenic
 

2125
00:35:38,640 --> 00:35:40,710
can do what's called oxygenic
photosynthesis lots of other bacteria

2126
00:35:40,710 --> 00:35:40,720
photosynthesis lots of other bacteria
 

2127
00:35:40,720 --> 00:35:43,030
photosynthesis lots of other bacteria
can split i mean you can take your

2128
00:35:43,030 --> 00:35:43,040
can split i mean you can take your
 

2129
00:35:43,040 --> 00:35:44,150
can split i mean you can take your
hydrogen from somewhere else you can

2130
00:35:44,150 --> 00:35:44,160
hydrogen from somewhere else you can
 

2131
00:35:44,160 --> 00:35:45,670
hydrogen from somewhere else you can
take it from hydrogen sulfide bubbling

2132
00:35:45,670 --> 00:35:45,680
take it from hydrogen sulfide bubbling
 

2133
00:35:45,680 --> 00:35:48,150
take it from hydrogen sulfide bubbling
out of a hydrothermal vent grab your two

2134
00:35:48,150 --> 00:35:48,160
out of a hydrothermal vent grab your two
 

2135
00:35:48,160 --> 00:35:51,349
out of a hydrothermal vent grab your two
hydrogens the sulfur is the waste now

2136
00:35:51,349 --> 00:35:51,359
hydrogens the sulfur is the waste now
 

2137
00:35:51,359 --> 00:35:53,589
hydrogens the sulfur is the waste now
um you can do it from iron you can take

2138
00:35:53,589 --> 00:35:53,599
um you can do it from iron you can take
 

2139
00:35:53,599 --> 00:35:55,030
um you can do it from iron you can take
electrons so the early oceans were

2140
00:35:55,030 --> 00:35:55,040
electrons so the early oceans were
 

2141
00:35:55,040 --> 00:35:56,630
electrons so the early oceans were
probably full of iron you can take an

2142
00:35:56,630 --> 00:35:56,640
probably full of iron you can take an
 

2143
00:35:56,640 --> 00:35:59,670
probably full of iron you can take an
electron from ferrous ion so iron two

2144
00:35:59,670 --> 00:35:59,680
electron from ferrous ion so iron two
 

2145
00:35:59,680 --> 00:36:01,829
electron from ferrous ion so iron two
plus and make it iron three plus which

2146
00:36:01,829 --> 00:36:01,839
plus and make it iron three plus which
 

2147
00:36:01,839 --> 00:36:03,829
plus and make it iron three plus which
now precipitates as rust

2148
00:36:03,829 --> 00:36:03,839
now precipitates as rust
 

2149
00:36:03,839 --> 00:36:06,390
now precipitates as rust
uh and you take a a proton from the

2150
00:36:06,390 --> 00:36:06,400
uh and you take a a proton from the
 

2151
00:36:06,400 --> 00:36:08,230
uh and you take a a proton from the
acidic early ocean stick it there now

2152
00:36:08,230 --> 00:36:08,240
acidic early ocean stick it there now
 

2153
00:36:08,240 --> 00:36:09,750
acidic early ocean stick it there now
you've got a hydrogen atom stick it onto

2154
00:36:09,750 --> 00:36:09,760
you've got a hydrogen atom stick it onto
 

2155
00:36:09,760 --> 00:36:12,310
you've got a hydrogen atom stick it onto
co2 you've just done the trick the

2156
00:36:12,310 --> 00:36:12,320
co2 you've just done the trick the
 

2157
00:36:12,320 --> 00:36:14,069
co2 you've just done the trick the
trouble is

2158
00:36:14,069 --> 00:36:14,079
trouble is
 

2159
00:36:14,079 --> 00:36:16,630
trouble is
you bury yourself in rusty iron and with

2160
00:36:16,630 --> 00:36:16,640
you bury yourself in rusty iron and with
 

2161
00:36:16,640 --> 00:36:18,390
you bury yourself in rusty iron and with
sulfur you can bury yourself in sulfur

2162
00:36:18,390 --> 00:36:18,400
sulfur you can bury yourself in sulfur
 

2163
00:36:18,400 --> 00:36:19,910
sulfur you can bury yourself in sulfur
one of the reasons oxygenic

2164
00:36:19,910 --> 00:36:19,920
one of the reasons oxygenic
 

2165
00:36:19,920 --> 00:36:22,150
one of the reasons oxygenic
photosynthesis is so much better is the

2166
00:36:22,150 --> 00:36:22,160
photosynthesis is so much better is the
 

2167
00:36:22,160 --> 00:36:23,510
photosynthesis is so much better is the
waste product is oxygen which just

2168
00:36:23,510 --> 00:36:23,520
waste product is oxygen which just
 

2169
00:36:23,520 --> 00:36:26,470
waste product is oxygen which just
bubbles away

2170
00:36:26,470 --> 00:36:26,480
bubbles away
 

2171
00:36:26,480 --> 00:36:29,510
bubbles away
that seems like extremely unlikely and

2172
00:36:29,510 --> 00:36:29,520
that seems like extremely unlikely and
 

2173
00:36:29,520 --> 00:36:30,870
that seems like extremely unlikely and
it's extremely essential for the

2174
00:36:30,870 --> 00:36:30,880
it's extremely essential for the
 

2175
00:36:30,880 --> 00:36:33,589
it's extremely essential for the
evolution of complex organisms

2176
00:36:33,589 --> 00:36:33,599
evolution of complex organisms
 

2177
00:36:33,599 --> 00:36:35,990
evolution of complex organisms
because of all the oxygen

2178
00:36:35,990 --> 00:36:36,000
because of all the oxygen
 

2179
00:36:36,000 --> 00:36:38,150
because of all the oxygen
yeah and that didn't accumulate quickly

2180
00:36:38,150 --> 00:36:38,160
yeah and that didn't accumulate quickly
 

2181
00:36:38,160 --> 00:36:39,270
yeah and that didn't accumulate quickly
either

2182
00:36:39,270 --> 00:36:39,280
either
 

2183
00:36:39,280 --> 00:36:41,430
either
so it's converting

2184
00:36:41,430 --> 00:36:41,440
so it's converting
 

2185
00:36:41,440 --> 00:36:43,109
so it's converting
what is it it's converting energy from

2186
00:36:43,109 --> 00:36:43,119
what is it it's converting energy from
 

2187
00:36:43,119 --> 00:36:44,630
what is it it's converting energy from
the sun

2188
00:36:44,630 --> 00:36:44,640
the sun
 

2189
00:36:44,640 --> 00:36:46,870
the sun
and the resource of water

2190
00:36:46,870 --> 00:36:46,880
and the resource of water
 

2191
00:36:46,880 --> 00:36:47,910
and the resource of water
into

2192
00:36:47,910 --> 00:36:47,920
into
 

2193
00:36:47,920 --> 00:36:50,710
into
the resource needed for animals

2194
00:36:50,710 --> 00:36:50,720
the resource needed for animals
 

2195
00:36:50,720 --> 00:36:52,390
the resource needed for animals
both resources needed for animals we

2196
00:36:52,390 --> 00:36:52,400
both resources needed for animals we
 

2197
00:36:52,400 --> 00:36:54,390
both resources needed for animals we
need to eat and we need to burn the food

2198
00:36:54,390 --> 00:36:54,400
need to eat and we need to burn the food
 

2199
00:36:54,400 --> 00:36:57,910
need to eat and we need to burn the food
and the we're eating plants um which are

2200
00:36:57,910 --> 00:36:57,920
and the we're eating plants um which are
 

2201
00:36:57,920 --> 00:36:59,589
and the we're eating plants um which are
getting their energy from the sun and

2202
00:36:59,589 --> 00:36:59,599
getting their energy from the sun and
 

2203
00:36:59,599 --> 00:37:00,790
getting their energy from the sun and
we're burning it with their waste

2204
00:37:00,790 --> 00:37:00,800
we're burning it with their waste
 

2205
00:37:00,800 --> 00:37:02,470
we're burning it with their waste
products which is the oxygen

2206
00:37:02,470 --> 00:37:02,480
products which is the oxygen
 

2207
00:37:02,480 --> 00:37:04,230
products which is the oxygen
so there's a lot of kind of circularity

2208
00:37:04,230 --> 00:37:04,240
so there's a lot of kind of circularity
 

2209
00:37:04,240 --> 00:37:06,230
so there's a lot of kind of circularity
in that but with with without an

2210
00:37:06,230 --> 00:37:06,240
in that but with with without an
 

2211
00:37:06,240 --> 00:37:08,710
in that but with with without an
oxygenated planet you couldn't really

2212
00:37:08,710 --> 00:37:08,720
oxygenated planet you couldn't really
 

2213
00:37:08,720 --> 00:37:09,829
oxygenated planet you couldn't really
have

2214
00:37:09,829 --> 00:37:09,839
have
 

2215
00:37:09,839 --> 00:37:10,950
have
um

2216
00:37:10,950 --> 00:37:10,960
um
 

2217
00:37:10,960 --> 00:37:12,470
um
predation

2220
00:37:13,190 --> 00:37:13,200
you
 

2221
00:37:13,200 --> 00:37:15,109
you
you don't you can have animals but you

2222
00:37:15,109 --> 00:37:15,119
you don't you can have animals but you
 

2223
00:37:15,119 --> 00:37:16,630
you don't you can have animals but you
can't really have animals that go around

2224
00:37:16,630 --> 00:37:16,640
can't really have animals that go around
 

2225
00:37:16,640 --> 00:37:17,829
can't really have animals that go around
and eat each other you can't have

2226
00:37:17,829 --> 00:37:17,839
and eat each other you can't have
 

2227
00:37:17,839 --> 00:37:20,069
and eat each other you can't have
ecosystems as we know them well let's

2228
00:37:20,069 --> 00:37:20,079
ecosystems as we know them well let's
 

2229
00:37:20,079 --> 00:37:22,950
ecosystems as we know them well let's
actually step back what about eukaryotic

2230
00:37:22,950 --> 00:37:22,960
actually step back what about eukaryotic
 

2231
00:37:22,960 --> 00:37:25,510
actually step back what about eukaryotic

what how big

2234
00:37:27,030 --> 00:37:27,040
what how big
 

2235
00:37:27,040 --> 00:37:29,030
what how big
what are each of those and how big of an

what are each of those and how big of an
 

2237
00:37:29,040 --> 00:37:30,950
what are each of those and how big of an
invention is that

2238
00:37:30,950 --> 00:37:30,960
invention is that
 

2239
00:37:30,960 --> 00:37:32,390
invention is that
i personally think that's the single

2240
00:37:32,390 --> 00:37:32,400
i personally think that's the single
 

2241
00:37:32,400 --> 00:37:33,910
i personally think that's the single
biggest invention in the whole history

2242
00:37:33,910 --> 00:37:33,920
biggest invention in the whole history
 

2243
00:37:33,920 --> 00:37:35,750
biggest invention in the whole history
of life exciting

2244
00:37:35,750 --> 00:37:35,760
of life exciting
 

2245
00:37:35,760 --> 00:37:37,589
of life exciting
so what what are they can you explain

2246
00:37:37,589 --> 00:37:37,599
so what what are they can you explain
 

2247
00:37:37,599 --> 00:37:40,150
so what what are they can you explain
yeah so so so i mentioned bacteria and

2248
00:37:40,150 --> 00:37:40,160
yeah so so so i mentioned bacteria and
 

2249
00:37:40,160 --> 00:37:42,390
yeah so so so i mentioned bacteria and
archaea these are both prokaryotes

2250
00:37:42,390 --> 00:37:42,400
archaea these are both prokaryotes
 

2251
00:37:42,400 --> 00:37:44,550
archaea these are both prokaryotes
um they're basically small cells that

2252
00:37:44,550 --> 00:37:44,560
um they're basically small cells that
 

2253
00:37:44,560 --> 00:37:46,150
um they're basically small cells that
don't have a nucleus if you look at them

2254
00:37:46,150 --> 00:37:46,160
don't have a nucleus if you look at them
 

2255
00:37:46,160 --> 00:37:47,589
don't have a nucleus if you look at them
under a microscope you don't see much

2256
00:37:47,589 --> 00:37:47,599
under a microscope you don't see much
 

2257
00:37:47,599 --> 00:37:49,109
under a microscope you don't see much
going on if you look at them under a

2258
00:37:49,109 --> 00:37:49,119
going on if you look at them under a
 

2259
00:37:49,119 --> 00:37:50,950
going on if you look at them under a
super resolution microscope then they're

2260
00:37:50,950 --> 00:37:50,960
super resolution microscope then they're
 

2261
00:37:50,960 --> 00:37:53,109
super resolution microscope then they're
fantastically complex

2262
00:37:53,109 --> 00:37:53,119
fantastically complex
 

2263
00:37:53,119 --> 00:37:54,710
fantastically complex
in terms of their molecular machinery

2264
00:37:54,710 --> 00:37:54,720
in terms of their molecular machinery
 

2265
00:37:54,720 --> 00:37:56,470
in terms of their molecular machinery
they're amazing in terms of their

2266
00:37:56,470 --> 00:37:56,480
they're amazing in terms of their
 

2267
00:37:56,480 --> 00:37:58,470
they're amazing in terms of their
morphological appearance under a

morphological appearance under a
 

2269
00:37:58,480 --> 00:38:01,349
morphological appearance under a
microscope they're really small

2270
00:38:01,349 --> 00:38:01,359
microscope they're really small
 

2271
00:38:01,359 --> 00:38:03,670
microscope they're really small
and really simple the earliest life that

2272
00:38:03,670 --> 00:38:03,680
and really simple the earliest life that
 

2273
00:38:03,680 --> 00:38:05,510
and really simple the earliest life that
we can physically see on the planet are

2274
00:38:05,510 --> 00:38:05,520
we can physically see on the planet are
 

2275
00:38:05,520 --> 00:38:07,270
we can physically see on the planet are
stromatolites which are made by things

2276
00:38:07,270 --> 00:38:07,280
stromatolites which are made by things
 

2277
00:38:07,280 --> 00:38:09,270
stromatolites which are made by things
like cyanobacteria and then they're

2278
00:38:09,270 --> 00:38:09,280
like cyanobacteria and then they're
 

2279
00:38:09,280 --> 00:38:11,349
like cyanobacteria and then they're

2283
00:38:14,320 --> 00:38:16,150
biofilms plated on top of each other
and and you end up with quite quite

2284
00:38:16,150 --> 00:38:16,160
and and you end up with quite quite
 

2285
00:38:16,160 --> 00:38:18,069
and and you end up with quite quite
large structures that you can see in the

00:38:18,069 --> 00:38:18,079
large structures that you can see in the

00:38:21,670 --> 00:38:21,680
but they they don't
 

2291
00:38:21,680 --> 00:38:23,109
but they they don't
they never came up with animals they

00:38:23,109 --> 00:38:23,119
they never came up with animals they
 

2293
00:38:23,119 --> 00:38:24,710
they never came up with animals they
never came up with plants they they hear

00:38:24,710 --> 00:38:24,720
never came up with plants they they hear
 

2295
00:38:24,720 --> 00:38:27,109
never came up with plants they they hear
with multicellular things filamentous

00:38:27,109 --> 00:38:27,119
with multicellular things filamentous
 

2297
00:38:27,119 --> 00:38:28,710
with multicellular things filamentous
cyanobacteria for example they're just

long you know strings of cells

2300
00:38:31,270 --> 00:38:31,280
long you know strings of cells
 

2301
00:38:31,280 --> 00:38:34,470
long you know strings of cells
but the origin of the eukaryotic cell

2302
00:38:34,470 --> 00:38:34,480
but the origin of the eukaryotic cell
 

2303
00:38:34,480 --> 00:38:36,230
but the origin of the eukaryotic cell
seems to have been what's called an

2304
00:38:36,230 --> 00:38:36,240
seems to have been what's called an
 

2305
00:38:36,240 --> 00:38:38,390
seems to have been what's called an
endosymbiosis so one cell gets inside

2306
00:38:38,390 --> 00:38:38,400
endosymbiosis so one cell gets inside
 

2307
00:38:38,400 --> 00:38:39,750
endosymbiosis so one cell gets inside
another cell

2308
00:38:39,750 --> 00:38:39,760
another cell
 

2309
00:38:39,760 --> 00:38:42,069
another cell
and i think that that transformed the

2310
00:38:42,069 --> 00:38:42,079
and i think that that transformed the
 

2311
00:38:42,079 --> 00:38:44,069
and i think that that transformed the
energetic possibilities of life so what

00:38:55,520 --> 00:38:57,510
if you think about you could think about
it as a multi-bacterial power without

it as a multi-bacterial power without
 

2327
00:38:57,520 --> 00:38:59,109
it as a multi-bacterial power without
the overhead so you've got you've got a

the overhead so you've got you've got a
 

2329
00:38:59,119 --> 00:39:00,710

the energy currency it needs but each
bacterium has a genome of its own which

bacterium has a genome of its own which
 

2337
00:39:07,280 --> 00:39:09,349
bacterium has a genome of its own which
costs a fair amount of energy to

what the mitochondria did which are

2344
00:39:16,950 --> 00:39:16,960
what the mitochondria did which are
 

2345
00:39:16,960 --> 00:39:18,230
what the mitochondria did which are
these

2346
00:39:18,230 --> 00:39:18,240
these
 

2347
00:39:18,240 --> 00:39:20,950
these
power packs in our own cells they were

2348
00:39:20,950 --> 00:39:20,960
power packs in our own cells they were
 

2349
00:39:20,960 --> 00:39:23,030
power packs in our own cells they were
bacteria once and they threw away

2350
00:39:23,030 --> 00:39:23,040
bacteria once and they threw away
 

2351
00:39:23,040 --> 00:39:24,310
bacteria once and they threw away
virtually all their genes they've only

2352
00:39:24,310 --> 00:39:24,320
virtually all their genes they've only
 

2353
00:39:24,320 --> 00:39:25,510
virtually all their genes they've only
got a few left

2354
00:39:25,510 --> 00:39:25,520
got a few left
 

2355
00:39:25,520 --> 00:39:27,829
got a few left
so mitochondria is like you said is the

2356
00:39:27,829 --> 00:39:27,839
so mitochondria is like you said is the
 

2357
00:39:27,839 --> 00:39:29,910
so mitochondria is like you said is the
bacteria that got inside a cell

2358
00:39:29,910 --> 00:39:29,920
bacteria that got inside a cell
 

2359
00:39:29,920 --> 00:39:31,349
bacteria that got inside a cell
and then throw away all this stuff it

2360
00:39:31,349 --> 00:39:31,359
and then throw away all this stuff it
 

2361
00:39:31,359 --> 00:39:33,829
and then throw away all this stuff it
doesn't need to survive inside the cell

2362
00:39:33,829 --> 00:39:33,839
doesn't need to survive inside the cell
 

2363
00:39:33,839 --> 00:39:35,990
doesn't need to survive inside the cell
and then kept what so what we end up

2364
00:39:35,990 --> 00:39:36,000
and then kept what so what we end up
 

2365
00:39:36,000 --> 00:39:37,670
and then kept what so what we end up
with so it kept always a handful of

2366
00:39:37,670 --> 00:39:37,680
with so it kept always a handful of
 

2367
00:39:37,680 --> 00:39:38,710
with so it kept always a handful of
genes

2368
00:39:38,710 --> 00:39:38,720
genes
 

2369
00:39:38,720 --> 00:39:41,030
genes
in our own case 37 genes

2370
00:39:41,030 --> 00:39:41,040
in our own case 37 genes
 

2371
00:39:41,040 --> 00:39:43,190
in our own case 37 genes
um but there's a there's a few protists

2372
00:39:43,190 --> 00:39:43,200
um but there's a there's a few protists
 

2373
00:39:43,200 --> 00:39:44,710
um but there's a there's a few protists
which are single cells things that have

2374
00:39:44,710 --> 00:39:44,720
which are single cells things that have
 

2375
00:39:44,720 --> 00:39:47,829
which are single cells things that have
got as many as 70 or 80 genes so it's

2376
00:39:47,829 --> 00:39:47,839
got as many as 70 or 80 genes so it's
 

2377
00:39:47,839 --> 00:39:49,349
got as many as 70 or 80 genes so it's
not always the same but it's always a

2378
00:39:49,349 --> 00:39:49,359
not always the same but it's always a
 

2379
00:39:49,359 --> 00:39:50,470
not always the same but it's always a
small number

2380
00:39:50,470 --> 00:39:50,480
small number
 

2381
00:39:50,480 --> 00:39:51,910
small number
um and

2382
00:39:51,910 --> 00:39:51,920
um and
 

2383
00:39:51,920 --> 00:39:53,270
um and
you can think of it as a paired down

2384
00:39:53,270 --> 00:39:53,280
you can think of it as a paired down
 

2385
00:39:53,280 --> 00:39:55,190
you can think of it as a paired down
power pack where the control unit is

2386
00:39:55,190 --> 00:39:55,200
power pack where the control unit is
 

2387
00:39:55,200 --> 00:39:57,349
power pack where the control unit is
really being has been kind of paired

2388
00:39:57,349 --> 00:39:57,359
really being has been kind of paired
 

2389
00:39:57,359 --> 00:39:59,430
really being has been kind of paired
down to almost nothing so you're putting

2390
00:39:59,430 --> 00:39:59,440
down to almost nothing so you're putting
 

2391
00:39:59,440 --> 00:40:01,349
down to almost nothing so you're putting
out the same power but the the

2392
00:40:01,349 --> 00:40:01,359
out the same power but the the
 

2393
00:40:01,359 --> 00:40:03,430
out the same power but the the
investment in in the overheads is really

2394
00:40:03,430 --> 00:40:03,440
investment in in the overheads is really
 

2395
00:40:03,440 --> 00:40:05,270
investment in in the overheads is really
paired down that means that you can

2396
00:40:05,270 --> 00:40:05,280
paired down that means that you can
 

2397
00:40:05,280 --> 00:40:08,470
paired down that means that you can
support a much larger nuclear genome so

2398
00:40:08,470 --> 00:40:08,480
support a much larger nuclear genome so
 

2399
00:40:08,480 --> 00:40:10,550
support a much larger nuclear genome so
we've gone up in the number of genes but

2400
00:40:10,550 --> 00:40:10,560
we've gone up in the number of genes but
 

2401
00:40:10,560 --> 00:40:12,230
we've gone up in the number of genes but
also the amount of power you have to

2402
00:40:12,230 --> 00:40:12,240
also the amount of power you have to
 

2403
00:40:12,240 --> 00:40:14,710
also the amount of power you have to
convert those genes into proteins

2404
00:40:14,710 --> 00:40:14,720
convert those genes into proteins
 

2405
00:40:14,720 --> 00:40:16,230
convert those genes into proteins
we've gone up about four-fold in the

2406
00:40:16,230 --> 00:40:16,240
we've gone up about four-fold in the
 

2407
00:40:16,240 --> 00:40:18,069
we've gone up about four-fold in the
number of genes but in terms of the the

2408
00:40:18,069 --> 00:40:18,079
number of genes but in terms of the the
 

2409
00:40:18,079 --> 00:40:20,790
number of genes but in terms of the the
size of genomes and your ability to to

2410
00:40:20,790 --> 00:40:20,800
size of genomes and your ability to to
 

2411
00:40:20,800 --> 00:40:21,990
size of genomes and your ability to to
make the building blocks make the

2412
00:40:21,990 --> 00:40:22,000
make the building blocks make the
 

2413
00:40:22,000 --> 00:40:23,589
make the building blocks make the
proteins we've gone up a hundred

2414
00:40:23,589 --> 00:40:23,599
proteins we've gone up a hundred
 

2415
00:40:23,599 --> 00:40:26,309
proteins we've gone up a hundred
thousand fold or more so it's huge step

2416
00:40:26,309 --> 00:40:26,319
thousand fold or more so it's huge step
 

2417
00:40:26,319 --> 00:40:29,430
thousand fold or more so it's huge step
change in the possibilities of evolution

2418
00:40:29,430 --> 00:40:29,440
change in the possibilities of evolution
 

2419
00:40:29,440 --> 00:40:31,510
change in the possibilities of evolution
uh and it is it's interesting then that

2420
00:40:31,510 --> 00:40:31,520
uh and it is it's interesting then that
 

2421
00:40:31,520 --> 00:40:34,150
uh and it is it's interesting then that
the only the only two occasions that

2422
00:40:34,150 --> 00:40:34,160
the only the only two occasions that
 

2423
00:40:34,160 --> 00:40:36,150
the only the only two occasions that
complex life has arisen on earth plants

2424
00:40:36,150 --> 00:40:36,160
complex life has arisen on earth plants
 

2425
00:40:36,160 --> 00:40:36,829
complex life has arisen on earth plants
and

2426
00:40:36,829 --> 00:40:36,839
and
 

2427
00:40:36,839 --> 00:40:39,750
and
animals fungi you could say are complex

2428
00:40:39,750 --> 00:40:39,760
animals fungi you could say are complex
 

2429
00:40:39,760 --> 00:40:41,349
animals fungi you could say are complex
as well but they don't form

2430
00:40:41,349 --> 00:40:41,359
as well but they don't form
 

2431
00:40:41,359 --> 00:40:43,510
as well but they don't form
such complex morphology as plants and

2432
00:40:43,510 --> 00:40:43,520
such complex morphology as plants and
 

2433
00:40:43,520 --> 00:40:44,470
such complex morphology as plants and
animals

2434
00:40:44,470 --> 00:40:44,480
animals
 

2435
00:40:44,480 --> 00:40:46,470
animals
start with a single cell they start with

2436
00:40:46,470 --> 00:40:46,480
start with a single cell they start with
 

2437
00:40:46,480 --> 00:40:49,190
start with a single cell they start with
an oocyte and a sperm fused together to

2438
00:40:49,190 --> 00:40:49,200
an oocyte and a sperm fused together to
 

2439
00:40:49,200 --> 00:40:51,430
an oocyte and a sperm fused together to
make a zygote so we start development

2440
00:40:51,430 --> 00:40:51,440
make a zygote so we start development
 

2441
00:40:51,440 --> 00:40:53,349
make a zygote so we start development
with a single cell and all the cells in

2442
00:40:53,349 --> 00:40:53,359
with a single cell and all the cells in
 

2443
00:40:53,359 --> 00:40:56,309
with a single cell and all the cells in
the organism have identical dna

2444
00:40:56,309 --> 00:40:56,319
the organism have identical dna
 

2445
00:40:56,319 --> 00:40:58,309
the organism have identical dna
and you switch off in the brain you

2446
00:40:58,309 --> 00:40:58,319
and you switch off in the brain you
 

2447
00:40:58,319 --> 00:40:59,829
and you switch off in the brain you
switch off these genes and you switch on

2448
00:40:59,829 --> 00:40:59,839
switch off these genes and you switch on
 

2449
00:40:59,839 --> 00:41:01,270
switch off these genes and you switch on
those genes and liver you switch off

2450
00:41:01,270 --> 00:41:01,280
those genes and liver you switch off
 

2451
00:41:01,280 --> 00:41:03,910
those genes and liver you switch off
those and you switch on a different set

2452
00:41:03,910 --> 00:41:03,920
those and you switch on a different set
 

2453
00:41:03,920 --> 00:41:05,589
those and you switch on a different set
and the standard evolution explanation

2454
00:41:05,589 --> 00:41:05,599
and the standard evolution explanation
 

2455
00:41:05,599 --> 00:41:07,430
and the standard evolution explanation
for that is that you've you you're

2456
00:41:07,430 --> 00:41:07,440
for that is that you've you you're
 

2457
00:41:07,440 --> 00:41:08,790
for that is that you've you you're
restricting conflict you don't have a

2458
00:41:08,790 --> 00:41:08,800
restricting conflict you don't have a
 

2459
00:41:08,800 --> 00:41:11,030
restricting conflict you don't have a
load of genetically different cells that

2460
00:41:11,030 --> 00:41:11,040
load of genetically different cells that
 

2461
00:41:11,040 --> 00:41:14,230
load of genetically different cells that
are all fighting each other um and so it

2462
00:41:14,230 --> 00:41:14,240
are all fighting each other um and so it
 

2463
00:41:14,240 --> 00:41:15,990
are all fighting each other um and so it
works the trouble with bacteria they

2464
00:41:15,990 --> 00:41:16,000
works the trouble with bacteria they
 

2465
00:41:16,000 --> 00:41:17,430
works the trouble with bacteria they
form these biofilms and they're all

2466
00:41:17,430 --> 00:41:17,440
form these biofilms and they're all
 

2467
00:41:17,440 --> 00:41:19,829
form these biofilms and they're all
genetically different and effectively

2468
00:41:19,829 --> 00:41:19,839
genetically different and effectively
 

2469
00:41:19,839 --> 00:41:21,670
genetically different and effectively
they're incapable of that level of

2470
00:41:21,670 --> 00:41:21,680
they're incapable of that level of
 

2471
00:41:21,680 --> 00:41:23,109
they're incapable of that level of
cooperation

2472
00:41:23,109 --> 00:41:23,119
cooperation
 

2473
00:41:23,119 --> 00:41:26,230
cooperation
they would get in a fight

2474
00:41:26,230 --> 00:41:26,240

 

2475
00:41:26,240 --> 00:41:29,190

okay so uh why is this such a difficult

2476
00:41:29,190 --> 00:41:29,200
okay so uh why is this such a difficult
 

2477
00:41:29,200 --> 00:41:31,030
okay so uh why is this such a difficult
invention

2478
00:41:31,030 --> 00:41:31,040
invention
 

2479
00:41:31,040 --> 00:41:33,750
invention
of getting this bacteria inside and

2480
00:41:33,750 --> 00:41:33,760
of getting this bacteria inside and
 

2481
00:41:33,760 --> 00:41:35,670
of getting this bacteria inside and
becoming an engine

2482
00:41:35,670 --> 00:41:35,680
becoming an engine
 

2483
00:41:35,680 --> 00:41:38,069
becoming an engine
which the mitochondria is why was that

2484
00:41:38,069 --> 00:41:38,079
which the mitochondria is why was that
 

2485
00:41:38,079 --> 00:41:39,510
which the mitochondria is why was that
why do you assign it such great

2486
00:41:39,510 --> 00:41:39,520
why do you assign it such great
 

2487
00:41:39,520 --> 00:41:41,190
why do you assign it such great
importance is it great importance in

2488
00:41:41,190 --> 00:41:41,200
importance is it great importance in
 

2489
00:41:41,200 --> 00:41:42,630
importance is it great importance in
terms of the difficulty of how it was to

2490
00:41:42,630 --> 00:41:42,640
terms of the difficulty of how it was to
 

2491
00:41:42,640 --> 00:41:44,630
terms of the difficulty of how it was to
achieve a great importance in terms of

2492
00:41:44,630 --> 00:41:44,640
achieve a great importance in terms of
 

2493
00:41:44,640 --> 00:41:46,069
achieve a great importance in terms of
the impact they had

2494
00:41:46,069 --> 00:41:46,079
the impact they had
 

2495
00:41:46,079 --> 00:41:49,349
the impact they had
on life both uh it had a huge impact on

2496
00:41:49,349 --> 00:41:49,359
on life both uh it had a huge impact on
 

2497
00:41:49,359 --> 00:41:50,710
on life both uh it had a huge impact on
life because

2498
00:41:50,710 --> 00:41:50,720
life because
 

2499
00:41:50,720 --> 00:41:53,430
life because
if if that had not happened you can be

2500
00:41:53,430 --> 00:41:53,440
if if that had not happened you can be
 

2501
00:41:53,440 --> 00:41:55,109
if if that had not happened you can be
certain that life on earth would be

2502
00:41:55,109 --> 00:41:55,119
certain that life on earth would be
 

2503
00:41:55,119 --> 00:41:57,109
certain that life on earth would be
bacterial only and that took a really

2504
00:41:57,109 --> 00:41:57,119
bacterial only and that took a really
 

2505
00:41:57,119 --> 00:41:59,510
bacterial only and that took a really
long time too it took two billion years

2506
00:41:59,510 --> 00:41:59,520
long time too it took two billion years
 

2507
00:41:59,520 --> 00:42:01,430
long time too it took two billion years
yeah and it hasn't happened since to the

2508
00:42:01,430 --> 00:42:01,440
yeah and it hasn't happened since to the
 

2509
00:42:01,440 --> 00:42:03,670
yeah and it hasn't happened since to the
best of our knowledge so it looks as if

2510
00:42:03,670 --> 00:42:03,680
best of our knowledge so it looks as if
 

2511
00:42:03,680 --> 00:42:05,270
best of our knowledge so it looks as if
it's genuinely difficult and if you

2512
00:42:05,270 --> 00:42:05,280
it's genuinely difficult and if you
 

2513
00:42:05,280 --> 00:42:07,109
it's genuinely difficult and if you
think about it then from from from just

2514
00:42:07,109 --> 00:42:07,119
think about it then from from from just
 

2515
00:42:07,119 --> 00:42:08,710
think about it then from from from just
an informational perspective you you

2516
00:42:08,710 --> 00:42:08,720
an informational perspective you you
 

2517
00:42:08,720 --> 00:42:10,710
an informational perspective you you
think bacteria

2518
00:42:10,710 --> 00:42:10,720
think bacteria
 

2519
00:42:10,720 --> 00:42:12,470
think bacteria
have got

2520
00:42:12,470 --> 00:42:12,480
have got
 

2521
00:42:12,480 --> 00:42:14,150
have got
they they structure their information

2522
00:42:14,150 --> 00:42:14,160
they they structure their information
 

2523
00:42:14,160 --> 00:42:16,710
they they structure their information
differently so a bacterial cell has a

2524
00:42:16,710 --> 00:42:16,720
differently so a bacterial cell has a
 

2525
00:42:16,720 --> 00:42:18,630
differently so a bacterial cell has a
small genome you might have 4 000 genes

2526
00:42:18,630 --> 00:42:18,640
small genome you might have 4 000 genes
 

2527
00:42:18,640 --> 00:42:20,550
small genome you might have 4 000 genes
in it but a single e coli cell has

2528
00:42:20,550 --> 00:42:20,560
in it but a single e coli cell has
 

2529
00:42:20,560 --> 00:42:23,030
in it but a single e coli cell has
access to about 30 000 genes

2530
00:42:23,030 --> 00:42:23,040
access to about 30 000 genes
 

2531
00:42:23,040 --> 00:42:24,870
access to about 30 000 genes
potentially it's got a kind of meta

2532
00:42:24,870 --> 00:42:24,880
potentially it's got a kind of meta
 

2533
00:42:24,880 --> 00:42:27,829
potentially it's got a kind of meta
genome where other e coli out there have

2534
00:42:27,829 --> 00:42:27,839
genome where other e coli out there have
 

2535
00:42:27,839 --> 00:42:29,270
genome where other e coli out there have
got different gene sets and they can

2536
00:42:29,270 --> 00:42:29,280
got different gene sets and they can
 

2537
00:42:29,280 --> 00:42:31,990
got different gene sets and they can
switch them around between themselves

2538
00:42:31,990 --> 00:42:32,000
switch them around between themselves
 

2539
00:42:32,000 --> 00:42:33,829
switch them around between themselves
and so you can generate a huge amount of

2540
00:42:33,829 --> 00:42:33,839
and so you can generate a huge amount of
 

2541
00:42:33,839 --> 00:42:36,069
and so you can generate a huge amount of
variation and you know they've got more

2542
00:42:36,069 --> 00:42:36,079
variation and you know they've got more
 

2543
00:42:36,079 --> 00:42:37,510
variation and you know they've got more
an e coli

2544
00:42:37,510 --> 00:42:37,520
an e coli
 

2545
00:42:37,520 --> 00:42:39,670
an e coli
meta genome is larger than the human

2546
00:42:39,670 --> 00:42:39,680
meta genome is larger than the human
 

2547
00:42:39,680 --> 00:42:40,710
meta genome is larger than the human
genome

2548
00:42:40,710 --> 00:42:40,720
genome
 

2549
00:42:40,720 --> 00:42:43,109
genome
we own 20 000 genes or something

2550
00:42:43,109 --> 00:42:43,119
we own 20 000 genes or something
 

2551
00:42:43,119 --> 00:42:46,069
we own 20 000 genes or something
so and they've had four billion years of

2552
00:42:46,069 --> 00:42:46,079
so and they've had four billion years of
 

2553
00:42:46,079 --> 00:42:48,550
so and they've had four billion years of
evolution to work out what can i do and

2554
00:42:48,550 --> 00:42:48,560
evolution to work out what can i do and
 

2555
00:42:48,560 --> 00:42:51,510
evolution to work out what can i do and
what can't i do with this metagenome and

2556
00:42:51,510 --> 00:42:51,520
what can't i do with this metagenome and
 

2557
00:42:51,520 --> 00:42:53,190
what can't i do with this metagenome and
the answer is you're stuck you're still

2558
00:42:53,190 --> 00:42:53,200
the answer is you're stuck you're still
 

2559
00:42:53,200 --> 00:42:56,870
the answer is you're stuck you're still
bacteria so they have explored

2560
00:42:56,870 --> 00:42:56,880
bacteria so they have explored
 

2561
00:42:56,880 --> 00:42:58,870
bacteria so they have explored
genetic sequence space

2562
00:42:58,870 --> 00:42:58,880
genetic sequence space
 

2563
00:42:58,880 --> 00:43:00,950
genetic sequence space
far more thoroughly than eukaryotes ever

2564
00:43:00,950 --> 00:43:00,960
far more thoroughly than eukaryotes ever
 

2565
00:43:00,960 --> 00:43:02,630
far more thoroughly than eukaryotes ever
did because they've had twice as long at

2566
00:43:02,630 --> 00:43:02,640
did because they've had twice as long at
 

2567
00:43:02,640 --> 00:43:04,150
did because they've had twice as long at
least and they've they've got much

2568
00:43:04,150 --> 00:43:04,160
least and they've they've got much
 

2569
00:43:04,160 --> 00:43:06,630
least and they've they've got much
larger populations and they never they

2570
00:43:06,630 --> 00:43:06,640
larger populations and they never they
 

2571
00:43:06,640 --> 00:43:08,790
larger populations and they never they
never got around this problem so why

2572
00:43:08,790 --> 00:43:08,800
never got around this problem so why
 

2573
00:43:08,800 --> 00:43:10,230
never got around this problem so why
can't they it seems as if you can't

2574
00:43:10,230 --> 00:43:10,240
can't they it seems as if you can't
 

2575

00:44:38,240 --> 00:44:40,630
the power pack has to be all intact and
ready to go and uh it works i mean it's

2658
00:44:40,630 --> 00:44:40,640
ready to go and uh it works i mean it's
 

2659
00:44:40,640 --> 00:44:41,990
ready to go and uh it works i mean it's
a kind of step changing the

00:44:52,160 --> 00:44:53,270
it could take shorter time this is
another thing i would like to put the

00:44:53,270 --> 00:44:53,280
another thing i would like to put the
 

2675
00:44:53,280 --> 00:44:54,630
another thing i would like to put the
number of steps and try and work out

number of steps and try and work out
 

2677
00:44:54,640 --> 00:44:57,030
number of steps and try and work out
what's required at each step and we are

00:44:57,030 --> 00:44:57,040
what's required at each step and we are
 

2679
00:44:57,040 --> 00:44:58,470
what's required at each step and we are
trying to do that with sex for example

2680
00:44:58,470 --> 00:44:58,480
trying to do that with sex for example
 

2681
00:44:58,480 --> 00:45:00,630
trying to do that with sex for example
you can't have a very large genome

you can't have a very large genome
 

2683
00:45:00,640 --> 00:45:02,230
you can't have a very large genome
unless you have sex at that point so

00:45:02,230 --> 00:45:02,240
unless you have sex at that point so
 

2685
00:45:02,240 --> 00:45:03,750
unless you have sex at that point so
what are the changes to go from

00:45:03,750 --> 00:45:03,760
what are the changes to go from
 

2687
00:45:03,760 --> 00:45:05,910
what are the changes to go from

00:45:10,230 --> 00:45:10,240
what what do you need to do why do we go
 

2693
00:45:10,240 --> 00:45:12,470
what what do you need to do why do we go
from passing around bits of dna as if

recombining across the chromosomes and
 

2701
00:45:18,560 --> 00:45:20,230
recombining across the chromosomes and
then going through two rounds of cell

2702
00:45:20,230 --> 00:45:20,240
then going through two rounds of cell
 

2703
00:45:20,240 --> 00:45:22,470
then going through two rounds of cell
division to produce your gametes all

2704
00:45:22,470 --> 00:45:22,480
division to produce your gametes all
 

2705
00:45:22,480 --> 00:45:24,309
division to produce your gametes all
eukaryotes do it that way

2706
00:45:24,309 --> 00:45:24,319
eukaryotes do it that way
 

2707
00:45:24,319 --> 00:45:25,910
eukaryotes do it that way
so again you know

2708
00:45:25,910 --> 00:45:25,920
so again you know
 

2709
00:45:25,920 --> 00:45:28,710
so again you know
why switch what are the drivers here so

2710
00:45:28,710 --> 00:45:28,720
why switch what are the drivers here so
 

2711
00:45:28,720 --> 00:45:29,990
why switch what are the drivers here so
there's a lot of there's a lot of times

2712
00:45:29,990 --> 00:45:30,000
there's a lot of there's a lot of times
 

2713
00:45:30,000 --> 00:45:32,150
there's a lot of there's a lot of times
a lot of evolution but as soon as you've

2714
00:45:32,150 --> 00:45:32,160
a lot of evolution but as soon as you've
 

2715
00:45:32,160 --> 00:45:33,990
a lot of evolution but as soon as you've
got cells living inside another cell

2716
00:45:33,990 --> 00:45:34,000
got cells living inside another cell
 

2717
00:45:34,000 --> 00:45:36,390
got cells living inside another cell
what you've got is a is a new design you

2718
00:45:36,390 --> 00:45:36,400
what you've got is a is a new design you
 

2719
00:45:36,400 --> 00:45:38,150
what you've got is a is a new design you
you've got new potential that you didn't

2720
00:45:38,150 --> 00:45:38,160
you've got new potential that you didn't
 

2721
00:45:38,160 --> 00:45:40,069
you've got new potential that you didn't
have before so the

2722
00:45:40,069 --> 00:45:40,079
have before so the
 

2723
00:45:40,079 --> 00:45:42,230
have before so the
cell living inside another cell that

2724
00:45:42,230 --> 00:45:42,240
cell living inside another cell that
 

2725

better storage of information
 

2731
00:45:48,480 --> 00:45:51,030
better storage of information
better use of energy

2732
00:45:51,030 --> 00:45:51,040
better use of energy
 

2733
00:45:51,040 --> 00:45:53,670
better use of energy
uh more delegation like a hierarchical

2734
00:45:53,670 --> 00:45:53,680
uh more delegation like a hierarchical
 

2735
00:45:53,680 --> 00:45:55,270
uh more delegation like a hierarchical
control of the whole thing

2736
00:45:55,270 --> 00:45:55,280
control of the whole thing
 

2737
00:45:55,280 --> 00:45:56,309
control of the whole thing
and then

2738
00:45:56,309 --> 00:45:56,319
and then
 

2739
00:45:56,319 --> 00:45:58,150
and then
and then somehow that leads to ability

2740
00:45:58,150 --> 00:45:58,160
and then somehow that leads to ability
 

2741
00:45:58,160 --> 00:46:00,390
and then somehow that leads to ability
to have multi-cell organisms i'm not

2742
00:46:00,390 --> 00:46:00,400
to have multi-cell organisms i'm not
 

2743
00:46:00,400 --> 00:46:02,470
to have multi-cell organisms i'm not
sure that you have hierarchical control

2744
00:46:02,470 --> 00:46:02,480
sure that you have hierarchical control
 

2745
00:46:02,480 --> 00:46:04,550
sure that you have hierarchical control
necessarily but you you've got a system

2746
00:46:04,550 --> 00:46:04,560
necessarily but you you've got a system
 

2747
00:46:04,560 --> 00:46:07,750
necessarily but you you've got a system
where you can you can have a much larger

2748
00:46:07,750 --> 00:46:07,760
where you can you can have a much larger
 

2749
00:46:07,760 --> 00:46:09,829
where you can you can have a much larger
information storage depot in the nucleus

2750
00:46:09,829 --> 00:46:09,839
information storage depot in the nucleus
 

2751
00:46:09,839 --> 00:46:11,670
information storage depot in the nucleus
you can have a much larger genome and

2752
00:46:11,670 --> 00:46:11,680
you can have a much larger genome and
 

2753
00:46:11,680 --> 00:46:14,550
you can have a much larger genome and
that allows multicellularity yes because

2754
00:46:14,550 --> 00:46:14,560
that allows multicellularity yes because
 

2755
00:46:14,560 --> 00:46:17,109
that allows multicellularity yes because
um it allows you

2756
00:46:17,109 --> 00:46:17,119
um it allows you
 

2757
00:46:17,119 --> 00:46:19,030
um it allows you
it's it's a funny thing you to to have a

2758
00:46:19,030 --> 00:46:19,040
it's it's a funny thing you to to have a
 

2759
00:46:19,040 --> 00:46:22,550
it's it's a funny thing you to to have a
to have a an animal where i have you

2760
00:46:22,550 --> 00:46:22,560
to have a an animal where i have you
 

2761
00:46:22,560 --> 00:46:24,710
to have a an animal where i have you
know 70 of my genes switched on in my

2762
00:46:24,710 --> 00:46:24,720
know 70 of my genes switched on in my
 

2763
00:46:24,720 --> 00:46:26,870
know 70 of my genes switched on in my
brain and i have different 50 switched

2764
00:46:26,870 --> 00:46:26,880
brain and i have different 50 switched
 

2765
00:46:26,880 --> 00:46:28,550
brain and i have different 50 switched
on in my liver or something you've got

2766
00:46:28,550 --> 00:46:28,560
on in my liver or something you've got
 

2767
00:46:28,560 --> 00:46:30,710
on in my liver or something you've got
to have all those genes in the egg cell

2768
00:46:30,710 --> 00:46:30,720
to have all those genes in the egg cell
 

2769
00:46:30,720 --> 00:46:32,150
to have all those genes in the egg cell
at the very beginning and you've got to

2770
00:46:32,150 --> 00:46:32,160
at the very beginning and you've got to
 

2771
00:46:32,160 --> 00:46:35,510
at the very beginning and you've got to
have a a program of development which

2772
00:46:35,510 --> 00:46:35,520
have a a program of development which
 

2773
00:46:35,520 --> 00:46:37,430
have a a program of development which
says okay you guys switch off those

2774
00:46:37,430 --> 00:46:37,440
says okay you guys switch off those
 

2775
00:46:37,440 --> 00:46:38,950
says okay you guys switch off those
genes and switch on those genes and you

2776
00:46:38,950 --> 00:46:38,960
genes and switch on those genes and you
 

2777
00:46:38,960 --> 00:46:41,030
genes and switch on those genes and you
guys you do that but all the genes are

2778
00:46:41,030 --> 00:46:41,040
guys you do that but all the genes are
 

2779
00:46:41,040 --> 00:46:42,390
guys you do that but all the genes are
there at the beginning that means you've

2780
00:46:42,390 --> 00:46:42,400
there at the beginning that means you've
 

2781
00:46:42,400 --> 00:46:43,910
there at the beginning that means you've
got to have a lot of genes in one cell

2782
00:46:43,910 --> 00:46:43,920
got to have a lot of genes in one cell
 

2783
00:46:43,920 --> 00:46:45,030
got to have a lot of genes in one cell
and you've got to be able to maintain

2784
00:46:45,030 --> 00:46:45,040
and you've got to be able to maintain
 

2785
00:46:45,040 --> 00:46:46,710
and you've got to be able to maintain
them and the problem with bacteria is

2786
00:46:46,710 --> 00:46:46,720
them and the problem with bacteria is
 

2787
00:46:46,720 --> 00:46:48,150
them and the problem with bacteria is
they don't get close to having enough

2788
00:46:48,150 --> 00:46:48,160
they don't get close to having enough
 

2789
00:46:48,160 --> 00:46:50,470
they don't get close to having enough
genes in one cell so they would if you

2790
00:46:50,470 --> 00:46:50,480
genes in one cell so they would if you
 

2791
00:46:50,480 --> 00:46:52,230
genes in one cell so they would if you
were to try and make a multicellular

2792
00:46:52,230 --> 00:46:52,240
were to try and make a multicellular
 

2793
00:46:52,240 --> 00:46:53,750
were to try and make a multicellular
organism from bacteria you'd bring

2794
00:46:53,750 --> 00:46:53,760
organism from bacteria you'd bring
 

2795
00:46:53,760 --> 00:46:55,430
organism from bacteria you'd bring
different types of bacteria together and

2796
00:46:55,430 --> 00:46:55,440
different types of bacteria together and
 

2797
00:46:55,440 --> 00:46:57,190
different types of bacteria together and
hope they'll cooperate and the reality

2798
00:46:57,190 --> 00:46:57,200
hope they'll cooperate and the reality
 

2799
00:46:57,200 --> 00:46:58,710
hope they'll cooperate and the reality
is they don't that's really really tough

2800
00:46:58,710 --> 00:46:58,720
is they don't that's really really tough
 

2801
00:46:58,720 --> 00:47:00,630
is they don't that's really really tough
to do yeah coming into we know they

2802
00:47:00,630 --> 00:47:00,640
to do yeah coming into we know they
 

2803
00:47:00,640 --> 00:47:02,550
to do yeah coming into we know they
don't because they're it doesn't exist

2804
00:47:02,550 --> 00:47:02,560
don't because they're it doesn't exist
 

2805
00:47:02,560 --> 00:47:04,550
don't because they're it doesn't exist
we have the data as far as we know i'm

2806
00:47:04,550 --> 00:47:04,560
we have the data as far as we know i'm
 

2807
00:47:04,560 --> 00:47:06,309
we have the data as far as we know i'm
sure there's a few like special ones and

2808
00:47:06,309 --> 00:47:06,319
sure there's a few like special ones and
 

2809
00:47:06,319 --> 00:47:07,990
sure there's a few like special ones and
they did off quickly

2810
00:47:07,990 --> 00:47:08,000
they did off quickly
 

2811
00:47:08,000 --> 00:47:09,589
they did off quickly
i'd love to know some of the most fun

2812
00:47:09,589 --> 00:47:09,599
i'd love to know some of the most fun
 

2813
00:47:09,599 --> 00:47:12,390
i'd love to know some of the most fun
things bacteria have done since

2814
00:47:12,390 --> 00:47:12,400
things bacteria have done since
 

2815
00:47:12,400 --> 00:47:14,069
things bacteria have done since
oh there's a few i mean they can do some

2816
00:47:14,069 --> 00:47:14,079
oh there's a few i mean they can do some
 

2817
00:47:14,079 --> 00:47:16,230
oh there's a few i mean they can do some
pretty funky things and this is big this

2818
00:47:16,230 --> 00:47:16,240
pretty funky things and this is big this
 

2819
00:47:16,240 --> 00:47:17,910
pretty funky things and this is big this
is broad brush stroke that i'm talking

2820
00:47:17,910 --> 00:47:17,920
is broad brush stroke that i'm talking
 

2821
00:47:17,920 --> 00:47:18,790
is broad brush stroke that i'm talking
about

2822
00:47:18,790 --> 00:47:18,800
about
 

2823
00:47:18,800 --> 00:47:22,150
about
yeah generally speaking uh so how was uh

2824
00:47:22,150 --> 00:47:22,160
yeah generally speaking uh so how was uh
 

2825
00:47:22,160 --> 00:47:24,950
yeah generally speaking uh so how was uh
so another you know fun invention

2826
00:47:24,950 --> 00:47:24,960
so another you know fun invention
 

2827
00:47:24,960 --> 00:47:28,309
so another you know fun invention
us humans seem to uh utilize it well but

2828
00:47:28,309 --> 00:47:28,319
us humans seem to uh utilize it well but
 

2829
00:47:28,319 --> 00:47:30,069
us humans seem to uh utilize it well but
you say it's also very important early

2830
00:47:30,069 --> 00:47:30,079
you say it's also very important early
 

2831
00:47:30,079 --> 00:47:31,510
you say it's also very important early
on is sex

2832
00:47:31,510 --> 00:47:31,520
on is sex
 

2833
00:47:31,520 --> 00:47:32,710
on is sex
so uh

2834
00:47:32,710 --> 00:47:32,720
so uh
 

2835
00:47:32,720 --> 00:47:36,230
so uh
what is sex uh just asking for a friend

2836
00:47:36,230 --> 00:47:36,240
what is sex uh just asking for a friend
 

2837
00:47:36,240 --> 00:47:37,990
what is sex uh just asking for a friend
and when was it invented and how hard

2838
00:47:37,990 --> 00:47:38,000
and when was it invented and how hard
 

2839
00:47:38,000 --> 00:47:40,390
and when was it invented and how hard
was it to invent just as you were saying

2840
00:47:40,390 --> 00:47:40,400
was it to invent just as you were saying
 

2841
00:47:40,400 --> 00:47:43,270
was it to invent just as you were saying
and why was it invented why

2842
00:47:43,270 --> 00:47:43,280
and why was it invented why
 

2843
00:47:43,280 --> 00:47:45,589
and why was it invented why
how hard was it and when

2844
00:47:45,589 --> 00:47:45,599
how hard was it and when
 

2845
00:47:45,599 --> 00:47:47,510
how hard was it and when
i have a phd student who's been working

2846
00:47:47,510 --> 00:47:47,520
i have a phd student who's been working
 

2847
00:47:47,520 --> 00:47:48,950
i have a phd student who's been working
on this and we've just asked a couple of

2848
00:47:48,950 --> 00:47:48,960
on this and we've just asked a couple of
 

2849
00:47:48,960 --> 00:47:51,030
on this and we've just asked a couple of
papers on sex yes yes what do you

2850
00:47:51,030 --> 00:47:51,040
papers on sex yes yes what do you
 

2851
00:47:51,040 --> 00:47:53,589
papers on sex yes yes what do you
publish these biology is it biology

2852
00:47:53,589 --> 00:47:53,599
publish these biology is it biology
 

2853
00:47:53,599 --> 00:47:56,230
publish these biology is it biology
genetics journals yeah this is actually

00:47:56,230 --> 00:47:56,240
genetics journals yeah this is actually
 

2855
00:47:56,240 --> 00:47:58,390

broad big big picture everyone's

2860
00:48:02,549 --> 00:48:02,559
broad big big picture everyone's
 

2861
00:48:02,559 --> 00:48:05,109
broad big big picture everyone's
interested in sex

2862
00:48:05,109 --> 00:48:05,119
interested in sex
 

2863
00:48:05,119 --> 00:48:07,829
interested in sex
of biologists is to make sex dull

2864
00:48:07,829 --> 00:48:07,839
of biologists is to make sex dull
 

2865
00:48:07,839 --> 00:48:10,470
of biologists is to make sex dull
yes yeah that's a beautiful way to put

2866
00:48:10,470 --> 00:48:10,480
yes yeah that's a beautiful way to put
 

2867
00:48:10,480 --> 00:48:12,870
yes yeah that's a beautiful way to put
it okay so when was it invented

2868
00:48:12,870 --> 00:48:12,880
it okay so when was it invented
 

2869
00:48:12,880 --> 00:48:14,630
it okay so when was it invented
uh it was invented with eukaryotes about

2870
00:48:14,630 --> 00:48:14,640
uh it was invented with eukaryotes about
 

2871
00:48:14,640 --> 00:48:16,230
uh it was invented with eukaryotes about
two billion years ago

2872
00:48:16,230 --> 00:48:16,240
two billion years ago
 

2873
00:48:16,240 --> 00:48:18,870
two billion years ago
um all eukaryotes

2874
00:48:18,870 --> 00:48:18,880
um all eukaryotes
 

2875
00:48:18,880 --> 00:48:21,030
um all eukaryotes
share the same basic mechanism that you

2876
00:48:21,030 --> 00:48:21,040
share the same basic mechanism that you
 

2877
00:48:21,040 --> 00:48:22,950
share the same basic mechanism that you
produce gametes the gametes fuse

2878
00:48:22,950 --> 00:48:22,960
produce gametes the gametes fuse
 

2879
00:48:22,960 --> 00:48:25,190
produce gametes the gametes fuse
together so a gamete is the egg cell and

2880
00:48:25,190 --> 00:48:25,200
together so a gamete is the egg cell and
 

2881
00:48:25,200 --> 00:48:27,510
together so a gamete is the egg cell and
the sperm they're not necessarily even

2882
00:48:27,510 --> 00:48:27,520
the sperm they're not necessarily even
 

2883
00:48:27,520 --> 00:48:29,910
the sperm they're not necessarily even
different in size or shape so the

2884
00:48:29,910 --> 00:48:29,920
different in size or shape so the
 

2885
00:48:29,920 --> 00:48:31,829
different in size or shape so the
simplest eukaryotes produce what are

2886
00:48:31,829 --> 00:48:31,839
simplest eukaryotes produce what are
 

2887
00:48:31,839 --> 00:48:33,430
simplest eukaryotes produce what are
called motile gametes they're all like

2888
00:48:33,430 --> 00:48:33,440
called motile gametes they're all like
 

2889
00:48:33,440 --> 00:48:35,109
called motile gametes they're all like
sperm and they all swim around they find

2890
00:48:35,109 --> 00:48:35,119
sperm and they all swim around they find
 

2891
00:48:35,119 --> 00:48:36,549
sperm and they all swim around they find
each other they fuse together they don't

2892
00:48:36,549 --> 00:48:36,559
each other they fuse together they don't
 

2893
00:48:36,559 --> 00:48:38,069
each other they fuse together they don't
have kind of much

2894
00:48:38,069 --> 00:48:38,079
have kind of much
 

2895
00:48:38,079 --> 00:48:41,109
have kind of much
much going on there beyond that and then

2896
00:48:41,109 --> 00:48:41,119
much going on there beyond that and then
 

2897
00:48:41,119 --> 00:48:42,549
much going on there beyond that and then
these are

2898
00:48:42,549 --> 00:48:42,559
these are
 

2899
00:48:42,559 --> 00:48:44,390
these are
haploid which is to say we all have two

2900
00:48:44,390 --> 00:48:44,400
haploid which is to say we all have two
 

2901
00:48:44,400 --> 00:48:47,109
haploid which is to say we all have two
copies of our genome and the the gametes

2902
00:48:47,109 --> 00:48:47,119
copies of our genome and the the gametes
 

2903
00:48:47,119 --> 00:48:49,190
copies of our genome and the the gametes
have only a single copy of the genome so

2904
00:48:49,190 --> 00:48:49,200
have only a single copy of the genome so
 

2905
00:48:49,200 --> 00:48:51,190
have only a single copy of the genome so
when they fuse together you now become

2906
00:48:51,190 --> 00:48:51,200
when they fuse together you now become
 

2907
00:48:51,200 --> 00:48:52,630
when they fuse together you now become
diploid again which is to say you now

2908
00:48:52,630 --> 00:48:52,640
diploid again which is to say you now
 

2909
00:48:52,640 --> 00:48:55,270
diploid again which is to say you now
have two copies of your genome and what

2910
00:48:55,270 --> 00:48:55,280
have two copies of your genome and what
 

2911
00:48:55,280 --> 00:48:58,230
have two copies of your genome and what
you do is you line them all up

2912
00:48:58,230 --> 00:48:58,240
you do is you line them all up
 

2913
00:48:58,240 --> 00:49:00,630
you do is you line them all up
um and then you and then you double

2914
00:49:00,630 --> 00:49:00,640
um and then you and then you double
 

2915
00:49:00,640 --> 00:49:02,870
um and then you and then you double
everything so now we have four copies of

2916
00:49:02,870 --> 00:49:02,880
everything so now we have four copies of
 

2917
00:49:02,880 --> 00:49:04,549
everything so now we have four copies of
the complete genome and then we criss

2918
00:49:04,549 --> 00:49:04,559
the complete genome and then we criss
 

2919
00:49:04,559 --> 00:49:06,150
the complete genome and then we criss
cross between all of these things so we

2920
00:49:06,150 --> 00:49:06,160
cross between all of these things so we
 

2921
00:49:06,160 --> 00:49:07,349
cross between all of these things so we
take a bit from here and stick it on

2922
00:49:07,349 --> 00:49:07,359
take a bit from here and stick it on
 

2923
00:49:07,359 --> 00:49:08,549
take a bit from here and stick it on
there and a bit from here and we stick

2924
00:49:08,549 --> 00:49:08,559
there and a bit from here and we stick
 

2925
00:49:08,559 --> 00:49:11,109
there and a bit from here and we stick
it on here that's recombination

2926
00:49:11,109 --> 00:49:11,119
it on here that's recombination
 

2927
00:49:11,119 --> 00:49:13,750
it on here that's recombination
um and and then we go through two rounds

2928
00:49:13,750 --> 00:49:13,760
um and and then we go through two rounds
 

2929
00:49:13,760 --> 00:49:15,990
um and and then we go through two rounds
of cell division so we divide in half so

2930
00:49:15,990 --> 00:49:16,000
of cell division so we divide in half so
 

2931
00:49:16,000 --> 00:49:17,430
of cell division so we divide in half so
now the two daughter cells have two

2932
00:49:17,430 --> 00:49:17,440
now the two daughter cells have two
 

2933
00:49:17,440 --> 00:49:19,430
now the two daughter cells have two
copies and we don't divide in half again

2934
00:49:19,430 --> 00:49:19,440
copies and we don't divide in half again
 

2935
00:49:19,440 --> 00:49:21,589
copies and we don't divide in half again
now we have some gametes each of which

2936
00:49:21,589 --> 00:49:21,599
now we have some gametes each of which
 

2937
00:49:21,599 --> 00:49:24,390
now we have some gametes each of which
has got a single copy of the genome

2938
00:49:24,390 --> 00:49:24,400
has got a single copy of the genome
 

2939
00:49:24,400 --> 00:49:26,870
has got a single copy of the genome
and that's the basic ground plan for

2940
00:49:26,870 --> 00:49:26,880
and that's the basic ground plan for
 

2941
00:49:26,880 --> 00:49:28,870
and that's the basic ground plan for
what's called meiosis and uh and

2942
00:49:28,870 --> 00:49:28,880
what's called meiosis and uh and
 

2943
00:49:28,880 --> 00:49:29,910
what's called meiosis and uh and
enhancing

2944
00:49:29,910 --> 00:49:29,920
enhancing
 

2945
00:49:29,920 --> 00:49:31,430
enhancing
that's basically sex

2946
00:49:31,430 --> 00:49:31,440
that's basically sex
 

2947
00:49:31,440 --> 00:49:32,549
that's basically sex
and it happens at the level of

2948
00:49:32,549 --> 00:49:32,559
and it happens at the level of
 

2949
00:49:32,559 --> 00:49:34,390
and it happens at the level of
single-celled organisms and it happens

2950
00:49:34,390 --> 00:49:34,400
single-celled organisms and it happens
 

2951
00:49:34,400 --> 00:49:35,829
single-celled organisms and it happens
pretty much the same way in plants and

2952
00:49:35,829 --> 00:49:35,839
pretty much the same way in plants and
 

2953
00:49:35,839 --> 00:49:37,190
pretty much the same way in plants and
pretty much the same way in animals and

2954
00:49:37,190 --> 00:49:37,200
pretty much the same way in animals and
 

2955
00:49:37,200 --> 00:49:40,150
pretty much the same way in animals and
so on and it's not found in any bacteria

2956
00:49:40,150 --> 00:49:40,160
so on and it's not found in any bacteria
 

2957
00:49:40,160 --> 00:49:42,309
so on and it's not found in any bacteria
they switch things around using the same

2958
00:49:42,309 --> 00:49:42,319
they switch things around using the same
 

2959
00:49:42,319 --> 00:49:44,069
they switch things around using the same
machinery and they take up a bit of dna

2960
00:49:44,069 --> 00:49:44,079
machinery and they take up a bit of dna
 

2961
00:49:44,079 --> 00:49:45,430
machinery and they take up a bit of dna
from the environment they take out this

2962
00:49:45,430 --> 00:49:45,440
from the environment they take out this
 

2963
00:49:45,440 --> 00:49:46,950
from the environment they take out this
bit and stick in that bit and it's the

2964
00:49:46,950 --> 00:49:46,960
bit and stick in that bit and it's the
 

2965
00:49:46,960 --> 00:49:49,030
bit and stick in that bit and it's the
same molecular machinery they're using

2966
00:49:49,030 --> 00:49:49,040
same molecular machinery they're using
 

2967
00:49:49,040 --> 00:49:51,430
same molecular machinery they're using
to do it so what about the kind of you

2968
00:49:51,430 --> 00:49:51,440
to do it so what about the kind of you
 

2969
00:49:51,440 --> 00:49:53,109
to do it so what about the kind of you
said find each other this kind of

2970
00:49:53,109 --> 00:49:53,119
said find each other this kind of
 

2971
00:49:53,119 --> 00:49:54,230
said find each other this kind of
imperative

2972
00:49:54,230 --> 00:49:54,240
imperative
 

2973
00:49:54,240 --> 00:49:55,910
imperative
yeah find each other

2974
00:49:55,910 --> 00:49:55,920
yeah find each other
 

2975
00:49:55,920 --> 00:49:57,109
yeah find each other
what is that

2976
00:49:57,109 --> 00:49:57,119
what is that
 

2977
00:49:57,119 --> 00:49:59,510
what is that
like is that well you've got a few cells

2978
00:49:59,510 --> 00:49:59,520
like is that well you've got a few cells
 

2979
00:49:59,520 --> 00:50:00,470
like is that well you've got a few cells
together

2980
00:50:00,470 --> 00:50:00,480
together
 

2981
00:50:00,480 --> 00:50:02,309
together
so the bottom the bottom line on all of

2982
00:50:02,309 --> 00:50:02,319
so the bottom the bottom line on all of
 

2983
00:50:02,319 --> 00:50:04,870
so the bottom the bottom line on all of
this is is is bacteria i mean it's kind

2984
00:50:04,870 --> 00:50:04,880
this is is is bacteria i mean it's kind
 

2985
00:50:04,880 --> 00:50:07,109
this is is is bacteria i mean it's kind
of simple uh when when you when you've

2986
00:50:07,109 --> 00:50:07,119
of simple uh when when you when you've
 

2987
00:50:07,119 --> 00:50:08,710
of simple uh when when you when you've
figured it out and figuring it out this

2988
00:50:08,710 --> 00:50:08,720
figured it out and figuring it out this
 

2989
00:50:08,720 --> 00:50:10,870
figured it out and figuring it out this
is not me this is my phd student marco

2990
00:50:10,870 --> 00:50:10,880
is not me this is my phd student marco
 

2991
00:50:10,880 --> 00:50:12,950
is not me this is my phd student marco
kolnagi um

2992
00:50:12,950 --> 00:50:12,960
kolnagi um
 

2993
00:50:12,960 --> 00:50:14,710
kolnagi um
and uh and

2994
00:50:14,710 --> 00:50:14,720
and uh and
 

2995
00:50:14,720 --> 00:50:16,470
and uh and
in effect if you if you're doing lateral

2996
00:50:16,470 --> 00:50:16,480
in effect if you if you're doing lateral
 

2997
00:50:16,480 --> 00:50:19,109
in effect if you if you're doing lateral
you're an e coli cell you've got 4 000

2998
00:50:19,109 --> 00:50:19,119
you're an e coli cell you've got 4 000
 

2999
00:50:19,119 --> 00:50:20,710
you're an e coli cell you've got 4 000
genes you want to scale up to a

3000
00:50:20,710 --> 00:50:20,720
genes you want to scale up to a
 

3001
00:50:20,720 --> 00:50:23,750
genes you want to scale up to a
eukaryotic size and i want to have 20

3002
00:50:23,750 --> 00:50:23,760
eukaryotic size and i want to have 20
 

3003
00:50:23,760 --> 00:50:26,390
eukaryotic size and i want to have 20
000 genes um and i'm and i need to

3004
00:50:26,390 --> 00:50:26,400
000 genes um and i'm and i need to
 

3005
00:50:26,400 --> 00:50:28,390
000 genes um and i'm and i need to
maintain my genome so it doesn't get

3006
00:50:28,390 --> 00:50:28,400
maintain my genome so it doesn't get
 

3007
00:50:28,400 --> 00:50:30,549
maintain my genome so it doesn't get
shot to pieces by mutations and i'm

3008
00:50:30,549 --> 00:50:30,559
shot to pieces by mutations and i'm
 

3009
00:50:30,559 --> 00:50:32,630
shot to pieces by mutations and i'm
going to do it by lateral gene transfer

3010
00:50:32,630 --> 00:50:32,640
going to do it by lateral gene transfer
 

3011
00:50:32,640 --> 00:50:33,510
going to do it by lateral gene transfer
so

3012
00:50:33,510 --> 00:50:33,520
so
 

3013
00:50:33,520 --> 00:50:35,349
so
i know i've got a mutation in a gene i

3014
00:50:35,349 --> 00:50:35,359
i know i've got a mutation in a gene i
 

3015
00:50:35,359 --> 00:50:37,670
i know i've got a mutation in a gene i
don't know which gene it is because i'm

3016
00:50:37,670 --> 00:50:37,680
don't know which gene it is because i'm
 

3017
00:50:37,680 --> 00:50:40,150
don't know which gene it is because i'm
not sentient but i know i can't grow i

3018
00:50:40,150 --> 00:50:40,160
not sentient but i know i can't grow i
 

3019
00:50:40,160 --> 00:50:41,589
not sentient but i know i can't grow i
know all my regulation systems are

3020
00:50:41,589 --> 00:50:41,599
know all my regulation systems are
 

3021
00:50:41,599 --> 00:50:42,390
know all my regulation systems are
saying

3022
00:50:42,390 --> 00:50:42,400

00:50:43,670 --> 00:50:43,680
something wrong here something wrong
 

3025
00:50:43,680 --> 00:50:45,750
something wrong here something wrong
pick up some dna pick up a bit of dna

pick up some dna pick up a bit of dna
 

3027
00:50:45,760 --> 00:50:47,510
pick up some dna pick up a bit of dna
from the environment

3028

from the environment
if you've got a small genome the chances

3030
00:50:49,349 --> 00:50:49,359
if you've got a small genome the chances
 

3031
00:50:49,359 --> 00:50:50,870
if you've got a small genome the chances
of you picking up the right bit of dna

3032
00:50:50,870 --> 00:50:50,880
of you picking up the right bit of dna
 

3033
00:50:50,880 --> 00:50:52,309
of you picking up the right bit of dna
from the environment is much higher than

3034
00:50:52,309 --> 00:50:52,319
from the environment is much higher than
 

3035
00:50:52,319 --> 00:50:54,630
from the environment is much higher than
if you've got a genome of 20 000 genes

3036
00:50:54,630 --> 00:50:54,640
if you've got a genome of 20 000 genes
 

3037
00:50:54,640 --> 00:50:57,109
if you've got a genome of 20 000 genes
to do that you've effectively got to be

3038
00:50:57,109 --> 00:50:57,119
to do that you've effectively got to be
 

3039
00:50:57,119 --> 00:50:59,670
to do that you've effectively got to be
picking up dna all the time all day long

3040
00:50:59,670 --> 00:50:59,680
picking up dna all the time all day long
 

3041
00:50:59,680 --> 00:51:00,950
picking up dna all the time all day long
and nothing else and you're still going

3042
00:51:00,950 --> 00:51:00,960
and nothing else and you're still going
 

3043
00:51:00,960 --> 00:51:02,630
and nothing else and you're still going
to get the wrong dna you've got to pick

3044
00:51:02,630 --> 00:51:02,640
to get the wrong dna you've got to pick
 

3045
00:51:02,640 --> 00:51:04,150
to get the wrong dna you've got to pick
up large chunks and in the end you've

3046
00:51:04,150 --> 00:51:04,160
up large chunks and in the end you've
 

3047
00:51:04,160 --> 00:51:06,309
up large chunks and in the end you've
got to align them you're forced

3048
00:51:06,309 --> 00:51:06,319
got to align them you're forced
 

3049
00:51:06,319 --> 00:51:07,829
got to align them you're forced
into

3050
00:51:07,829 --> 00:51:07,839
into
 

3051
00:51:07,839 --> 00:51:10,069
into
to kind of phrase um

3052
00:51:10,069 --> 00:51:10,079
to kind of phrase um
 

3053
00:51:10,079 --> 00:51:11,829
to kind of phrase um
so yeah

3054
00:51:11,829 --> 00:51:11,839
so yeah
 

3055
00:51:11,839 --> 00:51:16,150
so yeah
uh so it's it's so there is a kind of uh

3056
00:51:16,150 --> 00:51:16,160
uh so it's it's so there is a kind of uh
 

3057
00:51:16,160 --> 00:51:18,230
uh so it's it's so there is a kind of uh
um incentive

3058
00:51:18,230 --> 00:51:18,240
um incentive
 

3059
00:51:18,240 --> 00:51:19,990
um incentive
uh if you want to have a large genome

3060
00:51:19,990 --> 00:51:20,000
uh if you want to have a large genome
 

3061
00:51:20,000 --> 00:51:21,589
uh if you want to have a large genome
you've got to prevent it mutating to

3062
00:51:21,589 --> 00:51:21,599
you've got to prevent it mutating to
 

3063
00:51:21,599 --> 00:51:22,549
you've got to prevent it mutating to
nothing

3064
00:51:22,549 --> 00:51:22,559
nothing
 

3065
00:51:22,559 --> 00:51:24,150
nothing
that will happen with bacteria there's

3066
00:51:24,150 --> 00:51:24,160
that will happen with bacteria there's
 

3067
00:51:24,160 --> 00:51:25,990
that will happen with bacteria there's
another reason why bacteria can't have a

3068
00:51:25,990 --> 00:51:26,000
another reason why bacteria can't have a
 

3069
00:51:26,000 --> 00:51:27,670
another reason why bacteria can't have a
large genome but as soon as you give

3070
00:51:27,670 --> 00:51:27,680
large genome but as soon as you give
 

3071
00:51:27,680 --> 00:51:28,950
large genome but as soon as you give
them the power path as soon as you give

3072
00:51:28,950 --> 00:51:28,960
them the power path as soon as you give
 

3073
00:51:28,960 --> 00:51:30,390
them the power path as soon as you give
your carotid cells the power pack that

3074
00:51:30,390 --> 00:51:30,400
your carotid cells the power pack that
 

3075
00:51:30,400 --> 00:51:31,910
your carotid cells the power pack that
allows them to increase the size of

3076
00:51:31,910 --> 00:51:31,920
allows them to increase the size of
 

3077
00:51:31,920 --> 00:51:34,230
allows them to increase the size of
their genome then you face the pressure

3078
00:51:34,230 --> 00:51:34,240
their genome then you face the pressure
 

3079
00:51:34,240 --> 00:51:36,150
their genome then you face the pressure
that you've got to maintain its quality

3080
00:51:36,150 --> 00:51:36,160
that you've got to maintain its quality
 

3081
00:51:36,160 --> 00:51:38,150
that you've got to maintain its quality
you've got to stop it just mutating away

3082
00:51:38,150 --> 00:51:38,160
you've got to stop it just mutating away
 

3083
00:51:38,160 --> 00:51:40,390
you've got to stop it just mutating away
what about sexual selection so the the

3084
00:51:40,390 --> 00:51:40,400
what about sexual selection so the the
 

3085
00:51:40,400 --> 00:51:42,069
what about sexual selection so the the
finding

3086
00:51:42,069 --> 00:51:42,079
finding
 

3087
00:51:42,079 --> 00:51:44,870
finding
uh like uh i don't like this one i don't

3088
00:51:44,870 --> 00:51:44,880
uh like uh i don't like this one i don't
 

3089
00:51:44,880 --> 00:51:47,109
uh like uh i don't like this one i don't
like this one this one seems all right

3090
00:51:47,109 --> 00:51:47,119
like this one this one seems all right
 

3091
00:51:47,119 --> 00:51:49,109
like this one this one seems all right
like what's the the

3092
00:51:49,109 --> 00:51:49,119
like what's the the
 

3093
00:51:49,119 --> 00:51:51,270
like what's the the
the is is it at which point does it

3094
00:51:51,270 --> 00:51:51,280
the is is it at which point does it
 

3095
00:51:51,280 --> 00:51:54,069
the is is it at which point does it
become less random it's hard to know

3096
00:51:54,069 --> 00:51:54,079
become less random it's hard to know
 

3097
00:51:54,079 --> 00:51:55,349
become less random it's hard to know
because your courier's just kind of

3098
00:51:55,349 --> 00:51:55,359
because your courier's just kind of
 

3099
00:51:55,359 --> 00:51:56,950
because your courier's just kind of
floated around i'm just kind of have

3100
00:51:56,950 --> 00:51:56,960
floated around i'm just kind of have
 

3101
00:51:56,960 --> 00:51:57,990
floated around i'm just kind of have
yeah there's everything that's their

3102
00:51:57,990 --> 00:51:58,000
yeah there's everything that's their
 

3103
00:51:58,000 --> 00:51:58,950
yeah there's everything that's their
section

3104
00:51:58,950 --> 00:51:58,960
section
 

3105
00:51:58,960 --> 00:52:00,230
section
in single cell do you characterize the

3106
00:52:00,230 --> 00:52:00,240
in single cell do you characterize the
 

3107
00:52:00,240 --> 00:52:01,670
in single cell do you characterize the
probably is it's just that i don't know

3108
00:52:01,670 --> 00:52:01,680
probably is it's just that i don't know
 

3109
00:52:01,680 --> 00:52:03,670
probably is it's just that i don't know
very much about it by the time you don't

3110
00:52:03,670 --> 00:52:03,680
very much about it by the time you don't
 

3111
00:52:03,680 --> 00:52:06,069
very much about it by the time you don't
hang out with the acquisitions well i do

3112
00:52:06,069 --> 00:52:06,079
hang out with the acquisitions well i do
 

3113
00:52:06,079 --> 00:52:07,910
hang out with the acquisitions well i do
all the time but you know but they can't

3114
00:52:07,910 --> 00:52:07,920
all the time but you know but they can't
 

3115
00:52:07,920 --> 00:52:09,670
all the time but you know but they can't
communicate with them yet yeah

3116
00:52:09,670 --> 00:52:09,680
communicate with them yet yeah
 

3117
00:52:09,680 --> 00:52:12,870
communicate with them yet yeah
peacock or something yes um

3118
00:52:12,870 --> 00:52:12,880
peacock or something yes um
 

3119
00:52:12,880 --> 00:52:14,710
peacock or something yes um
the kind of standardize is not quite

3120
00:52:14,710 --> 00:52:14,720
the kind of standardize is not quite
 

3121
00:52:14,720 --> 00:52:16,870
the kind of standardize is not quite
what i work on but the standard answer

3122
00:52:16,870 --> 00:52:16,880
what i work on but the standard answer
 

3123
00:52:16,880 --> 00:52:18,390
what i work on but the standard answer
uh is that

3124
00:52:18,390 --> 00:52:18,400
uh is that
 

3125
00:52:18,400 --> 00:52:20,390
uh is that
it's female mate choice she is looking

3126
00:52:20,390 --> 00:52:20,400
it's female mate choice she is looking
 

3127
00:52:20,400 --> 00:52:21,990
it's female mate choice she is looking
for good genes

3128
00:52:21,990 --> 00:52:22,000
for good genes
 

3129
00:52:22,000 --> 00:52:24,630
for good genes
um and and if you can have a tail that's

3130
00:52:24,630 --> 00:52:24,640
um and and if you can have a tail that's
 

3131
00:52:24,640 --> 00:52:25,829
um and and if you can have a tail that's
like this

3132
00:52:25,829 --> 00:52:25,839
like this
 

3133
00:52:25,839 --> 00:52:28,150
like this
and and still survive still be alive not

3134
00:52:28,150 --> 00:52:28,160
and and still survive still be alive not
 

3135
00:52:28,160 --> 00:52:29,829
and and still survive still be alive not
actually being taken down by the nearest

3136
00:52:29,829 --> 00:52:29,839
actually being taken down by the nearest
 

3137
00:52:29,839 --> 00:52:31,109
actually being taken down by the nearest
predator then you must have got pretty

3138
00:52:31,109 --> 00:52:31,119
predator then you must have got pretty
 

3139
00:52:31,119 --> 00:52:34,549
predator then you must have got pretty
good genes because despite this handicap

3140
00:52:34,549 --> 00:52:34,559
good genes because despite this handicap
 

3141
00:52:34,559 --> 00:52:36,710
good genes because despite this handicap
you're able to survive so so those are

3142
00:52:36,710 --> 00:52:36,720
you're able to survive so so those are
 

3143
00:52:36,720 --> 00:52:38,309
you're able to survive so so those are
like human interpretable things like

3144
00:52:38,309 --> 00:52:38,319
like human interpretable things like
 

3145
00:52:38,319 --> 00:52:40,950
like human interpretable things like
with a peacock but i wonder i'm sure

3146
00:52:40,950 --> 00:52:40,960
with a peacock but i wonder i'm sure
 

3147
00:52:40,960 --> 00:52:42,870
with a peacock but i wonder i'm sure
echoes of the same thing

3148
00:52:42,870 --> 00:52:42,880
echoes of the same thing
 

3149
00:52:42,880 --> 00:52:44,829
echoes of the same thing
are there with more primitive

3150
00:52:44,829 --> 00:52:44,839
are there with more primitive
 

3151
00:52:44,839 --> 00:52:46,470
are there with more primitive
organisms

3152
00:52:46,470 --> 00:52:46,480
organisms
 

3153
00:52:46,480 --> 00:52:49,430
organisms
basically your pr like uh how you

3154
00:52:49,430 --> 00:52:49,440
basically your pr like uh how you
 

3155
00:52:49,440 --> 00:52:53,109
basically your pr like uh how you
advertise yourself that you're worthy

3156
00:52:53,109 --> 00:52:53,119
advertise yourself that you're worthy
 

3157
00:52:53,119 --> 00:52:55,109
advertise yourself that you're worthy
yeah of uh absolutely so one big

3158
00:52:55,109 --> 00:52:55,119
yeah of uh absolutely so one big
 

3159
00:52:55,119 --> 00:52:56,470
yeah of uh absolutely so one big
advertisement is the fact that you

3160
00:52:56,470 --> 00:52:56,480
advertisement is the fact that you
 

3161
00:52:56,480 --> 00:52:58,150
advertisement is the fact that you
survived it all

3162
00:52:58,150 --> 00:52:58,160
survived it all
 

3163
00:52:58,160 --> 00:52:59,510
survived it all
let me give you one one beautiful

3164
00:52:59,510 --> 00:52:59,520
let me give you one one beautiful
 

3165
00:52:59,520 --> 00:53:02,870
let me give you one one beautiful
example uh of an algal bloom

3166
00:53:02,870 --> 00:53:02,880
example uh of an algal bloom
 

3167
00:53:02,880 --> 00:53:04,710
example uh of an algal bloom
and this can be this can be a

3168
00:53:04,710 --> 00:53:04,720
and this can be this can be a
 

3169
00:53:04,720 --> 00:53:07,030
and this can be this can be a
cyanobacteria it can be in bacteria

3170
00:53:07,030 --> 00:53:07,040
cyanobacteria it can be in bacteria
 

3171
00:53:07,040 --> 00:53:09,270
cyanobacteria it can be in bacteria
so so if if suddenly you you know you

3172
00:53:09,270 --> 00:53:09,280
so so if if suddenly you you know you
 

3173
00:53:09,280 --> 00:53:11,030
so so if if suddenly you you know you
pump nitrate or phosphate or something

3174
00:53:11,030 --> 00:53:11,040
pump nitrate or phosphate or something
 

3175
00:53:11,040 --> 00:53:13,109
pump nitrate or phosphate or something
into the ocean and everything goes green

3176
00:53:13,109 --> 00:53:13,119
into the ocean and everything goes green
 

3177
00:53:13,119 --> 00:53:14,630
into the ocean and everything goes green
you end up with all this

3178
00:53:14,630 --> 00:53:14,640
you end up with all this
 

3179
00:53:14,640 --> 00:53:15,750
you end up with all this
uh

3180
00:53:15,750 --> 00:53:15,760
uh
 

3181
00:53:15,760 --> 00:53:17,190
uh
algae growing there

3182
00:53:17,190 --> 00:53:17,200
algae growing there
 

3183
00:53:17,200 --> 00:53:17,990
algae growing there
um

3184
00:53:17,990 --> 00:53:18,000
um
 

3185
00:53:18,000 --> 00:53:20,710
um
a viral infection or something like that

3186
00:53:20,710 --> 00:53:20,720
a viral infection or something like that
 

3187
00:53:20,720 --> 00:53:23,190
a viral infection or something like that
can kill the entire bloom overnight

3188
00:53:23,190 --> 00:53:23,200
can kill the entire bloom overnight
 

3189
00:53:23,200 --> 00:53:25,190
can kill the entire bloom overnight
and it's not that the virus takes out

3190
00:53:25,190 --> 00:53:25,200
and it's not that the virus takes out
 

3191
00:53:25,200 --> 00:53:27,750
and it's not that the virus takes out
everything overnight it's that most of

3192
00:53:27,750 --> 00:53:27,760
everything overnight it's that most of
 

3193
00:53:27,760 --> 00:53:29,589
everything overnight it's that most of
the cells in that bloom kill themselves

3194
00:53:29,589 --> 00:53:29,599
the cells in that bloom kill themselves
 

3195
00:53:29,599 --> 00:53:31,829
the cells in that bloom kill themselves
before the virus can get onto them and

3196
00:53:31,829 --> 00:53:31,839
before the virus can get onto them and
 

3197
00:53:31,839 --> 00:53:33,829
before the virus can get onto them and
it's through a form of cell death called

3198
00:53:33,829 --> 00:53:33,839
it's through a form of cell death called
 

3199
00:53:33,839 --> 00:53:35,750
it's through a form of cell death called
programmed cell death and we we do the

3200
00:53:35,750 --> 00:53:35,760
programmed cell death and we we do the
 

3201
00:53:35,760 --> 00:53:37,190
programmed cell death and we we do the
same thing this is how we have the

3202
00:53:37,190 --> 00:53:37,200
same thing this is how we have the
 

3203
00:53:37,200 --> 00:53:38,710
same thing this is how we have the
different you know the gaps between our

3204
00:53:38,710 --> 00:53:38,720
different you know the gaps between our
 

3205
00:53:38,720 --> 00:53:40,710
different you know the gaps between our
fingers and so on it's how we craft

3206
00:53:40,710 --> 00:53:40,720
fingers and so on it's how we craft
 

3207
00:53:40,720 --> 00:53:42,390
fingers and so on it's how we craft
synapses in the brain

3208
00:53:42,390 --> 00:53:42,400
synapses in the brain
 

3209
00:53:42,400 --> 00:53:45,030
synapses in the brain
um it you know is fundamental again to

3210
00:53:45,030 --> 00:53:45,040
um it you know is fundamental again to
 

3211
00:53:45,040 --> 00:53:45,750
um it you know is fundamental again to
to

3212
00:53:45,750 --> 00:53:45,760
to
 

3213
00:53:45,760 --> 00:53:47,990
to
to multicellular life they have the same

3214
00:53:47,990 --> 00:53:48,000
to multicellular life they have the same
 

3215
00:53:48,000 --> 00:53:51,109
to multicellular life they have the same
machinery in these in these algal blooms

3216
00:53:51,109 --> 00:53:51,119
machinery in these in these algal blooms
 

3217
00:53:51,119 --> 00:53:54,230
machinery in these in these algal blooms
how do they know who dies the answer is

3218
00:53:54,230 --> 00:53:54,240
how do they know who dies the answer is
 

3219
00:53:54,240 --> 00:53:56,549
how do they know who dies the answer is
they will often put out a toxin

3220
00:53:56,549 --> 00:53:56,559
they will often put out a toxin
 

3221
00:53:56,559 --> 00:53:58,150
they will often put out a toxin
and that toxin

3222
00:53:58,150 --> 00:53:58,160
and that toxin
 

3223
00:53:58,160 --> 00:54:00,470
and that toxin
is a kind of a challenge to you either

3224
00:54:00,470 --> 00:54:00,480
is a kind of a challenge to you either
 

3225
00:54:00,480 --> 00:54:03,270
is a kind of a challenge to you either
you can cope with the toxin or you can't

3226
00:54:03,270 --> 00:54:03,280
you can cope with the toxin or you can't
 

3227
00:54:03,280 --> 00:54:06,309
you can cope with the toxin or you can't
if you can cope with it you form a spore

3228
00:54:06,309 --> 00:54:06,319
if you can cope with it you form a spore
 

3229
00:54:06,319 --> 00:54:07,829
if you can cope with it you form a spore
and you will go on to become the next

3230
00:54:07,829 --> 00:54:07,839
and you will go on to become the next
 

3231
00:54:07,839 --> 00:54:10,549
and you will go on to become the next
generation you you you form a kind of a

3232
00:54:10,549 --> 00:54:10,559
generation you you you form a kind of a
 

3233
00:54:10,559 --> 00:54:13,030
generation you you you form a kind of a
resistance spore you sink down a little

3234
00:54:13,030 --> 00:54:13,040
resistance spore you sink down a little
 

3235
00:54:13,040 --> 00:54:14,710
resistance spore you sink down a little
bit you get out of the way you're out of

3236
00:54:14,710 --> 00:54:14,720
bit you get out of the way you're out of
 

3237
00:54:14,720 --> 00:54:16,870
bit you get out of the way you're out of
the out out of you can't be attacked by

3238
00:54:16,870 --> 00:54:16,880
the out out of you can't be attacked by
 

3239
00:54:16,880 --> 00:54:18,549
the out out of you can't be attacked by
a virus if you're a spore at least not

3240
00:54:18,549 --> 00:54:18,559
a virus if you're a spore at least not
 

3241
00:54:18,559 --> 00:54:20,630
a virus if you're a spore at least not
so easily whereas if you can't deal with

3242
00:54:20,630 --> 00:54:20,640
so easily whereas if you can't deal with
 

3243
00:54:20,640 --> 00:54:23,589
so easily whereas if you can't deal with
that toxin you pull the plug and you you

3244
00:54:23,589 --> 00:54:23,599
that toxin you pull the plug and you you
 

3245
00:54:23,599 --> 00:54:25,670
that toxin you pull the plug and you you
you you trigger your death apparatus and

3246
00:54:25,670 --> 00:54:25,680
you you trigger your death apparatus and
 

3247
00:54:25,680 --> 00:54:27,750
you you trigger your death apparatus and
you kill yourself because it's truly

3248
00:54:27,750 --> 00:54:27,760
you kill yourself because it's truly
 

3249
00:54:27,760 --> 00:54:29,030
you kill yourself because it's truly
life and death

3250
00:54:29,030 --> 00:54:29,040
life and death
 

3251
00:54:29,040 --> 00:54:29,829
life and death
yeah

3252
00:54:29,829 --> 00:54:29,839
yeah
 

3253
00:54:29,839 --> 00:54:31,829
yeah
so it's really it's a challenge and this

3254
00:54:31,829 --> 00:54:31,839
so it's really it's a challenge and this
 

3255
00:54:31,839 --> 00:54:33,990
so it's really it's a challenge and this
is a bit like sexual selection it's not

3256
00:54:33,990 --> 00:54:34,000
is a bit like sexual selection it's not
 

3257
00:54:34,000 --> 00:54:35,670
is a bit like sexual selection it's not
so they're all pretty much genetically

3258
00:54:35,670 --> 00:54:35,680
so they're all pretty much genetically
 

3259
00:54:35,680 --> 00:54:36,789
so they're all pretty much genetically
identical

3260
00:54:36,789 --> 00:54:36,799
identical
 

3261
00:54:36,799 --> 00:54:38,950
identical
but they've had different life histories

3262
00:54:38,950 --> 00:54:38,960
but they've had different life histories
 

3263
00:54:38,960 --> 00:54:41,270
but they've had different life histories
so have you had a you know a tough day

3264
00:54:41,270 --> 00:54:41,280
so have you had a you know a tough day
 

3265
00:54:41,280 --> 00:54:43,589
so have you had a you know a tough day
did you did you happen to get infected

3266
00:54:43,589 --> 00:54:43,599
did you did you happen to get infected
 

3267
00:54:43,599 --> 00:54:45,430
did you did you happen to get infected
by this virus or did you run out of iron

3268
00:54:45,430 --> 00:54:45,440
by this virus or did you run out of iron
 

3269
00:54:45,440 --> 00:54:47,270
by this virus or did you run out of iron
or did you get a bit too much sun

3270
00:54:47,270 --> 00:54:47,280
or did you get a bit too much sun
 

3271
00:54:47,280 --> 00:54:50,309
or did you get a bit too much sun
whatever it may be if this extra stress

3272
00:54:50,309 --> 00:54:50,319
whatever it may be if this extra stress
 

3273
00:54:50,319 --> 00:54:52,069
whatever it may be if this extra stress
of the toxin just pushes you over the

3274
00:54:52,069 --> 00:54:52,079
of the toxin just pushes you over the
 

3275
00:54:52,079 --> 00:54:53,829
of the toxin just pushes you over the
edge then you have this binary choice

3276
00:54:53,829 --> 00:54:53,839
edge then you have this binary choice
 

3277
00:54:53,839 --> 00:54:55,349
edge then you have this binary choice
either you're the next generation or you

3278
00:54:55,349 --> 00:54:55,359
either you're the next generation or you
 

3279
00:54:55,359 --> 00:54:56,950
either you're the next generation or you
kill yourself now using this same

3280
00:54:56,950 --> 00:54:56,960
kill yourself now using this same
 

3281
00:54:56,960 --> 00:54:59,270
kill yourself now using this same
machinery it's also actually exactly the

3282
00:54:59,270 --> 00:54:59,280
machinery it's also actually exactly the
 

3283
00:54:59,280 --> 00:55:01,750
machinery it's also actually exactly the
way i approach dating but that's

3284
00:55:01,750 --> 00:55:01,760
way i approach dating but that's
 

3285
00:55:01,760 --> 00:55:03,910
way i approach dating but that's
probably why i'm single okay

3286
00:55:03,910 --> 00:55:03,920
probably why i'm single okay
 

3287
00:55:03,920 --> 00:55:07,270
probably why i'm single okay
uh what about if we can step back dna

3288
00:55:07,270 --> 00:55:07,280
uh what about if we can step back dna
 

3289
00:55:07,280 --> 00:55:10,390
uh what about if we can step back dna
just mechanism of storing information

3290
00:55:10,390 --> 00:55:10,400
just mechanism of storing information
 

3291
00:55:10,400 --> 00:55:13,030
just mechanism of storing information
rna dna yeah how big of an invention was

3292
00:55:13,030 --> 00:55:13,040
rna dna yeah how big of an invention was
 

3293
00:55:13,040 --> 00:55:15,270
rna dna yeah how big of an invention was
that that seems to be you that seems to

3294
00:55:15,270 --> 00:55:15,280
that that seems to be you that seems to
 

3295
00:55:15,280 --> 00:55:18,069
that that seems to be you that seems to
be fundamental to

3296
00:55:18,069 --> 00:55:18,079
be fundamental to
 

3297
00:55:18,079 --> 00:55:18,829
be fundamental to
like

3298
00:55:18,829 --> 00:55:18,839
like
 

3299
00:55:18,839 --> 00:55:20,710
like
something

3300
00:55:20,710 --> 00:55:20,720
something
 

3301
00:55:20,720 --> 00:55:23,190
something
deep within what life is is the ability

3302
00:55:23,190 --> 00:55:23,200
deep within what life is is the ability
 

3303
00:55:23,200 --> 00:55:25,990
deep within what life is is the ability
as you said to kind of store and

3304
00:55:25,990 --> 00:55:26,000
as you said to kind of store and
 

3305
00:55:26,000 --> 00:55:28,549
as you said to kind of store and
propagate information but then you also

3306
00:55:28,549 --> 00:55:28,559
propagate information but then you also
 

3307
00:55:28,559 --> 00:55:30,710
propagate information but then you also
kind of infer that with your and your

3308
00:55:30,710 --> 00:55:30,720
kind of infer that with your and your
 

3309
00:55:30,720 --> 00:55:32,470
kind of infer that with your and your
students work that

3310
00:55:32,470 --> 00:55:32,480
students work that
 

3311
00:55:32,480 --> 00:55:34,309
students work that
there's a deep connection between the

3312
00:55:34,309 --> 00:55:34,319
there's a deep connection between the
 

3313
00:55:34,319 --> 00:55:36,710
there's a deep connection between the
chemistry and the ability

3314
00:55:36,710 --> 00:55:36,720
chemistry and the ability
 

3315
00:55:36,720 --> 00:55:38,470
chemistry and the ability
uh to have this kind of genetic

3316
00:55:38,470 --> 00:55:38,480
uh to have this kind of genetic
 

3317
00:55:38,480 --> 00:55:40,150
uh to have this kind of genetic
information so how big of an invention

3318
00:55:40,150 --> 00:55:40,160
information so how big of an invention
 

3319
00:55:40,160 --> 00:55:42,069
information so how big of an invention
is is it to have

3320
00:55:42,069 --> 00:55:42,079
is is it to have
 

3321
00:55:42,079 --> 00:55:44,390
is is it to have
a nice representation a nice hard drive

3322
00:55:44,390 --> 00:55:44,400
a nice representation a nice hard drive
 

3323
00:55:44,400 --> 00:55:47,910
a nice representation a nice hard drive
for info to pass on huge i suspect uh i

3324
00:55:47,910 --> 00:55:47,920
for info to pass on huge i suspect uh i
 

3325
00:55:47,920 --> 00:55:49,190
for info to pass on huge i suspect uh i
mean but

3326
00:55:49,190 --> 00:55:49,200
mean but
 

3327
00:55:49,200 --> 00:55:50,630
mean but
when i was talking about the code you

3328
00:55:50,630 --> 00:55:50,640
when i was talking about the code you
 

3329
00:55:50,640 --> 00:55:53,270
when i was talking about the code you
see the code in rna as well and rna

3330
00:55:53,270 --> 00:55:53,280
see the code in rna as well and rna
 

3331
00:55:53,280 --> 00:55:55,510
see the code in rna as well and rna
almost certainly came first

3332
00:55:55,510 --> 00:55:55,520
almost certainly came first
 

3333
00:55:55,520 --> 00:55:57,990
almost certainly came first
um and there's been an idea going back

3334
00:55:57,990 --> 00:55:58,000
um and there's been an idea going back
 

3335
00:55:58,000 --> 00:56:00,470
um and there's been an idea going back
decades called the rna world because rna

3336
00:56:00,470 --> 00:56:00,480
decades called the rna world because rna
 

3337
00:56:00,480 --> 00:56:03,670
decades called the rna world because rna
in theory can copy itself and can

3338
00:56:03,670 --> 00:56:03,680
in theory can copy itself and can
 

3339
00:56:03,680 --> 00:56:05,829
in theory can copy itself and can
catalyze reactions so it kind of cuts

3340
00:56:05,829 --> 00:56:05,839
catalyze reactions so it kind of cuts
 

3341
00:56:05,839 --> 00:56:08,309
catalyze reactions so it kind of cuts
out this chicken and egg loop so dna

3342
00:56:08,309 --> 00:56:08,319
out this chicken and egg loop so dna
 

3343
00:56:08,319 --> 00:56:10,069
out this chicken and egg loop so dna
it's possible it's not that special so

3344
00:56:10,069 --> 00:56:10,079
it's possible it's not that special so
 

3345
00:56:10,079 --> 00:56:12,069
it's possible it's not that special so
our rna rna is the thing that does the

3346
00:56:12,069 --> 00:56:12,079
our rna rna is the thing that does the
 

3347
00:56:12,079 --> 00:56:13,589
our rna rna is the thing that does the
work really

3348
00:56:13,589 --> 00:56:13,599
work really
 

3349
00:56:13,599 --> 00:56:15,990
work really
and the code lies in rna the code lies

3350
00:56:15,990 --> 00:56:16,000
and the code lies in rna the code lies
 

3351
00:56:16,000 --> 00:56:17,589
and the code lies in rna the code lies
in the interactions between rna and

3352
00:56:17,589 --> 00:56:17,599
in the interactions between rna and
 

3353
00:56:17,599 --> 00:56:20,069
in the interactions between rna and
amino acids and it still is there today

3354
00:56:20,069 --> 00:56:20,079
amino acids and it still is there today
 

3355
00:56:20,079 --> 00:56:21,990
amino acids and it still is there today
in the ribosome for example which is

3356
00:56:21,990 --> 00:56:22,000
in the ribosome for example which is
 

3357
00:56:22,000 --> 00:56:23,910
in the ribosome for example which is
just kind of a giant ribozyme which is

3358
00:56:23,910 --> 00:56:23,920
just kind of a giant ribozyme which is
 

3359
00:56:23,920 --> 00:56:28,150
just kind of a giant ribozyme which is
to say it's an enzyme that's made of rna

3360
00:56:28,150 --> 00:56:28,160
to say it's an enzyme that's made of rna
 

3361
00:56:28,160 --> 00:56:29,430
to say it's an enzyme that's made of rna
so

3362
00:56:29,430 --> 00:56:29,440
so
 

3363
00:56:29,440 --> 00:56:32,309
so
getting to rna i suspect is probably not

3364
00:56:32,309 --> 00:56:32,319
getting to rna i suspect is probably not
 

3365
00:56:32,319 --> 00:56:33,990
getting to rna i suspect is probably not
that hard

3366
00:56:33,990 --> 00:56:34,000
that hard
 

3367
00:56:34,000 --> 00:56:36,470
that hard
but getting from rna

3368
00:56:36,470 --> 00:56:36,480
but getting from rna
 

3369
00:56:36,480 --> 00:56:38,309
but getting from rna
how do you you know there's multiple

3370
00:56:38,309 --> 00:56:38,319
how do you you know there's multiple
 

3371
00:56:38,319 --> 00:56:41,270
how do you you know there's multiple
different types of rna now how do how do

3372
00:56:41,270 --> 00:56:41,280
different types of rna now how do how do
 

3373
00:56:41,280 --> 00:56:42,710
different types of rna now how do how do
how do you distinguish this is something

3374
00:56:42,710 --> 00:56:42,720
how do you distinguish this is something
 

3375
00:56:42,720 --> 00:56:43,990
how do you distinguish this is something
where actively thinking about how do you

3376
00:56:43,990 --> 00:56:44,000
where actively thinking about how do you
 

3377
00:56:44,000 --> 00:56:46,069
where actively thinking about how do you
distinguish between you know a random

3378
00:56:46,069 --> 00:56:46,079
distinguish between you know a random
 

3379
00:56:46,079 --> 00:56:48,069
distinguish between you know a random
population of rnas some of them go on to

3380
00:56:48,069 --> 00:56:48,079
population of rnas some of them go on to
 

3381
00:56:48,079 --> 00:56:48,950
population of rnas some of them go on to
become

3382
00:56:48,950 --> 00:56:48,960
become
 

3383
00:56:48,960 --> 00:56:51,270
become
messenger rna that this is the the

00:56:51,270 --> 00:56:51,280
messenger rna that this is the the
 

3385
00:56:51,280 --> 00:56:53,030
messenger rna that this is the the
transcript of the code of the gene that

00:56:53,030 --> 00:56:53,040
transcript of the code of the gene that
 

3387
00:56:53,040 --> 00:56:55,670
transcript of the code of the gene that
you you want to make some of them become

00:56:55,670 --> 00:56:55,680
you you want to make some of them become
 

3389
00:56:55,680 --> 00:56:57,910
you you want to make some of them become
transfer rna which is which is the kind

00:56:59,750 --> 00:56:59,760
of the unit that holds the amino acid
 

3393
00:56:59,760 --> 00:57:00,950
of the unit that holds the amino acid
that's going to be polynomial

3394
00:57:00,950 --> 00:57:00,960
that's going to be polynomial
 

3395
00:57:00,960 --> 00:57:03,109
that's going to be polynomial
polymerized some of them become

polymerized some of them become
 

3397
00:57:03,119 --> 00:57:05,430
polymerized some of them become
ribosomal rna which is the machine which

00:57:05,430 --> 00:57:05,440
ribosomal rna which is the machine which
 

3399
00:57:05,440 --> 00:57:07,589

is joining them all up together
 

3401
00:57:07,599 --> 00:57:08,789
is joining them all up together
how do they

3402
00:57:08,789 --> 00:57:08,799
how do they
 

3403
00:57:08,799 --> 00:57:10,630
how do they
discriminate themselves and

3404
00:57:10,630 --> 00:57:10,640
discriminate themselves and
 

3405
00:57:10,640 --> 00:57:12,230
discriminate themselves and
you know some kind of phase transition

3406
00:57:12,230 --> 00:57:12,240
you know some kind of phase transition
 

3407
00:57:12,240 --> 00:57:14,309
you know some kind of phase transition
going on there what's i don't know it's

3408
00:57:14,309 --> 00:57:14,319
going on there what's i don't know it's
 

3409
00:57:14,319 --> 00:57:15,829
going on there what's i don't know it's
a difficult question

3410
00:57:15,829 --> 00:57:15,839
a difficult question
 

3411
00:57:15,839 --> 00:57:17,030
a difficult question
and we're now

3412
00:57:17,030 --> 00:57:17,040
and we're now
 

3413
00:57:17,040 --> 00:57:18,390
and we're now
in the region of biology where

3414
00:57:18,390 --> 00:57:18,400
in the region of biology where
 

3415
00:57:18,400 --> 00:57:19,990
in the region of biology where
information is coming in but the thing

3416
00:57:19,990 --> 00:57:20,000
information is coming in but the thing
 

3417
00:57:20,000 --> 00:57:22,069
information is coming in but the thing
about rna is very very good at what it

3418
00:57:22,069 --> 00:57:22,079
about rna is very very good at what it
 

3419
00:57:22,079 --> 00:57:24,630
about rna is very very good at what it
does but the largest genomes supported

3420
00:57:24,630 --> 00:57:24,640
does but the largest genomes supported
 

3421
00:57:24,640 --> 00:57:27,910
does but the largest genomes supported
by rna of rna viruses like hiv for

3422
00:57:27,910 --> 00:57:27,920
by rna of rna viruses like hiv for
 

3423
00:57:27,920 --> 00:57:30,789
by rna of rna viruses like hiv for
example they're pretty small

3424
00:57:30,789 --> 00:57:30,799
example they're pretty small
 

3425
00:57:30,799 --> 00:57:32,470
example they're pretty small
and and so there's a limit to how

3426
00:57:32,470 --> 00:57:32,480
and and so there's a limit to how
 

3427
00:57:32,480 --> 00:57:34,549
and and so there's a limit to how
complex life could be

3428
00:57:34,549 --> 00:57:34,559
complex life could be
 

3429
00:57:34,559 --> 00:57:36,470
complex life could be
unless you come up with dna which

3430
00:57:36,470 --> 00:57:36,480
unless you come up with dna which
 

3431
00:57:36,480 --> 00:57:39,190
unless you come up with dna which
chemically is a really small change but

3432
00:57:39,190 --> 00:57:39,200
chemically is a really small change but
 

3433
00:57:39,200 --> 00:57:41,589
chemically is a really small change but
how easy it is to make that change

3434
00:57:41,589 --> 00:57:41,599
how easy it is to make that change
 

3435
00:57:41,599 --> 00:57:42,950
how easy it is to make that change
i don't really know as soon as you've

3436
00:57:42,950 --> 00:57:42,960
i don't really know as soon as you've
 

3437
00:57:42,960 --> 00:57:45,349
i don't really know as soon as you've
got dna then you've got an amazingly

3438
00:57:45,349 --> 00:57:45,359
got dna then you've got an amazingly
 

3439
00:57:45,359 --> 00:57:48,309
got dna then you've got an amazingly
stable molecule for information storage

3440
00:57:48,309 --> 00:57:48,319
stable molecule for information storage
 

3441
00:57:48,319 --> 00:57:50,390
stable molecule for information storage
um and you can do absolutely anything

3442
00:57:50,390 --> 00:57:50,400
um and you can do absolutely anything
 

3443
00:57:50,400 --> 00:57:52,390
um and you can do absolutely anything
but how likely that transition from rna

3444
00:57:52,390 --> 00:57:52,400
but how likely that transition from rna
 

3445
00:57:52,400 --> 00:57:54,390
but how likely that transition from rna
to dna was i don't know either

3446
00:57:54,390 --> 00:57:54,400
to dna was i don't know either
 

3447
00:57:54,400 --> 00:57:55,910
to dna was i don't know either
how much possibility is there for

3448
00:57:55,910 --> 00:57:55,920
how much possibility is there for
 

3449
00:57:55,920 --> 00:57:58,230
how much possibility is there for
variety

3450
00:57:58,230 --> 00:57:58,240
variety
 

3451
00:57:58,240 --> 00:58:00,549
variety
in ways to store information because it

3452
00:58:00,549 --> 00:58:00,559
in ways to store information because it
 

3453
00:58:00,559 --> 00:58:02,150
in ways to store information because it
seems to be very specific

3454
00:58:02,150 --> 00:58:02,160
seems to be very specific
 

3455
00:58:02,160 --> 00:58:04,069
seems to be very specific
characteristics about

00:58:04,069 --> 00:58:04,079
characteristics about
 

3457
00:58:04,079 --> 00:58:06,870
characteristics about
the the programming language of dna yeah

3458
00:58:06,870 --> 00:58:06,880
the the programming language of dna yeah
 

3459
00:58:06,880 --> 00:58:08,470
the the programming language of dna yeah
there's a lot of work going on what's

3460
00:58:08,470 --> 00:58:08,480
there's a lot of work going on what's
 

3461
00:58:08,480 --> 00:58:10,789
there's a lot of work going on what's
called xenodna or

3462
00:58:10,789 --> 00:58:10,799
called xenodna or
 

3463
00:58:10,799 --> 00:58:14,549
called xenodna or
rna can we replace the the bases

3464
00:58:14,549 --> 00:58:14,559
rna can we replace the the bases
 

3465
00:58:14,559 --> 00:58:16,309
rna can we replace the the bases
themselves the the letters if you like

3466
00:58:16,309 --> 00:58:16,319
themselves the the letters if you like
 

3467
00:58:16,319 --> 00:58:19,109
themselves the the letters if you like
in in in rna or dna can we replace the

3468
00:58:19,109 --> 00:58:19,119
in in in rna or dna can we replace the
 

3469
00:58:19,119 --> 00:58:21,109
in in in rna or dna can we replace the
backbone can we replace for example

3470
00:58:21,109 --> 00:58:21,119
backbone can we replace for example
 

3471
00:58:21,119 --> 00:58:23,109
backbone can we replace for example
phosphate with arsenate

3472
00:58:23,109 --> 00:58:23,119
phosphate with arsenate
 

3473
00:58:23,119 --> 00:58:24,870
phosphate with arsenate
can we replace the sugar ribose or

3474
00:58:24,870 --> 00:58:24,880
can we replace the sugar ribose or
 

3475
00:58:24,880 --> 00:58:26,710
can we replace the sugar ribose or
deoxyribose with a different sugar and

3476
00:58:26,710 --> 00:58:26,720
deoxyribose with a different sugar and
 

3477
00:58:26,720 --> 00:58:28,390
deoxyribose with a different sugar and
the answer is yes you can

3478
00:58:28,390 --> 00:58:28,400
the answer is yes you can
 

3479
00:58:28,400 --> 00:58:29,750
the answer is yes you can
um

3480
00:58:29,750 --> 00:58:29,760
um
 

3481
00:58:29,760 --> 00:58:31,589
um
within limits

3482
00:58:31,589 --> 00:58:31,599
within limits
 

3483
00:58:31,599 --> 00:58:34,069
within limits
there's not an infinite space there

3484
00:58:34,069 --> 00:58:34,079
there's not an infinite space there
 

3485
00:58:34,079 --> 00:58:36,069
there's not an infinite space there
arsenate doesn't really work if the

3486
00:58:36,069 --> 00:58:36,079
arsenate doesn't really work if the
 

3487
00:58:36,079 --> 00:58:37,829
arsenate doesn't really work if the
bonds are not as strong as phosphate

3488
00:58:37,829 --> 00:58:37,839
bonds are not as strong as phosphate
 

3489
00:58:37,839 --> 00:58:39,109
bonds are not as strong as phosphate
it's probably quite hard to replace

3490
00:58:39,109 --> 00:58:39,119
it's probably quite hard to replace
 

3491
00:58:39,119 --> 00:58:42,230
it's probably quite hard to replace
phosphate um

3492
00:58:42,230 --> 00:58:42,240
phosphate um
 

3493
00:58:42,240 --> 00:58:44,150
phosphate um
it's possible to do it the question to

3494
00:58:44,150 --> 00:58:44,160
it's possible to do it the question to
 

3495
00:58:44,160 --> 00:58:45,750
it's possible to do it the question to
me is

3496
00:58:45,750 --> 00:58:45,760
me is
 

3497
00:58:45,760 --> 00:58:47,510
me is
why is it this way

3498
00:58:47,510 --> 00:58:47,520
why is it this way
 

3499
00:58:47,520 --> 00:58:49,270
why is it this way
is it because there was some form of

3500
00:58:49,270 --> 00:58:49,280
is it because there was some form of
 

3501
00:58:49,280 --> 00:58:51,430
is it because there was some form of
selection that this is better than the

3502
00:58:51,430 --> 00:58:51,440
selection that this is better than the
 

3503
00:58:51,440 --> 00:58:52,710
selection that this is better than the
other forms and there were lots of

3504
00:58:52,710 --> 00:58:52,720
other forms and there were lots of
 

3505
00:58:52,720 --> 00:58:54,549
other forms and there were lots of
competing forms of information storage

3506
00:58:54,549 --> 00:58:54,559
competing forms of information storage
 

3507
00:58:54,559 --> 00:58:55,829
competing forms of information storage
early on and this one was the one that

3508
00:58:55,829 --> 00:58:55,839
early on and this one was the one that
 

3509
00:58:55,839 --> 00:58:57,990
early on and this one was the one that
worked out or was it kind of channeled

3510
00:58:57,990 --> 00:58:58,000
worked out or was it kind of channeled
 

3511
00:58:58,000 --> 00:58:59,829
worked out or was it kind of channeled
that way that these are the molecules

3512
00:58:59,829 --> 00:58:59,839
that way that these are the molecules
 

3513
00:58:59,839 --> 00:59:01,270
that way that these are the molecules
that you're dealing with

3514
00:59:01,270 --> 00:59:01,280
that you're dealing with
 

3515
00:59:01,280 --> 00:59:04,390
that you're dealing with
um and and they work uh and i'm

3516
00:59:04,390 --> 00:59:04,400
um and and they work uh and i'm
 

3517
00:59:04,400 --> 00:59:05,829
um and and they work uh and i'm
increasingly thinking it's that way that

3518
00:59:05,829 --> 00:59:05,839
increasingly thinking it's that way that
 

3519
00:59:05,839 --> 00:59:08,789
increasingly thinking it's that way that
we're channeled towards ribose phosphate

3520
00:59:08,789 --> 00:59:08,799
we're channeled towards ribose phosphate
 

3521
00:59:08,799 --> 00:59:09,910
we're channeled towards ribose phosphate
and and

3522
00:59:09,910 --> 00:59:09,920
and and
 

3523
00:59:09,920 --> 00:59:12,230
and and
and the bases that are used but there

3524
00:59:12,230 --> 00:59:12,240
and the bases that are used but there
 

3525
00:59:12,240 --> 00:59:14,470
and the bases that are used but there
are you know 200 different letters

3526
00:59:14,470 --> 00:59:14,480
are you know 200 different letters
 

3527
00:59:14,480 --> 00:59:15,990
are you know 200 different letters
kicking around out there that could have

3528
00:59:15,990 --> 00:59:16,000
kicking around out there that could have
 

3529
00:59:16,000 --> 00:59:17,829
kicking around out there that could have
been used it's such an interesting

3530
00:59:17,829 --> 00:59:17,839
been used it's such an interesting
 

3531
00:59:17,839 --> 00:59:19,430
been used it's such an interesting
question if you look at in the

3532
00:59:19,430 --> 00:59:19,440
question if you look at in the
 

3533
00:59:19,440 --> 00:59:21,589
question if you look at in the
programming world in computer science

3534
00:59:21,589 --> 00:59:21,599
programming world in computer science
 

3535
00:59:21,599 --> 00:59:22,950
programming world in computer science
there's a programming language called

3536
00:59:22,950 --> 00:59:22,960
there's a programming language called
 

3537
00:59:22,960 --> 00:59:25,030
there's a programming language called
javascript yeah which was uh written

3538
00:59:25,030 --> 00:59:25,040
javascript yeah which was uh written
 

3539
00:59:25,040 --> 00:59:27,750
javascript yeah which was uh written
super quickly it's a giant mess but it

3540
00:59:27,750 --> 00:59:27,760
super quickly it's a giant mess but it
 

3541
00:59:27,760 --> 00:59:29,270
super quickly it's a giant mess but it
took over the world

3542
00:59:29,270 --> 00:59:29,280
took over the world
 

3543
00:59:29,280 --> 00:59:31,750
took over the world
and it was sounds very biological it was

3544
00:59:31,750 --> 00:59:31,760
and it was sounds very biological it was
 

3545
00:59:31,760 --> 00:59:33,990
and it was sounds very biological it was
it was kind of a running joke that like

3546
00:59:33,990 --> 00:59:34,000
it was kind of a running joke that like
 

3547
00:59:34,000 --> 00:59:34,950
it was kind of a running joke that like
um

3548
00:59:34,950 --> 00:59:34,960
um
 

3549
00:59:34,960 --> 00:59:37,349
um
like surely this can't be

3550
00:59:37,349 --> 00:59:37,359
like surely this can't be
 

3551
00:59:37,359 --> 00:59:39,430
like surely this can't be
the it's a terrible programming language

3552
00:59:39,430 --> 00:59:39,440
the it's a terrible programming language
 

3553
00:59:39,440 --> 00:59:41,270
the it's a terrible programming language
it's a giant mess it's full of

00:59:41,270 --> 00:59:41,280
it's a giant mess it's full of
 

3555
00:59:41,280 --> 00:59:43,270
it's a giant mess it's full of
bugs it's so easy to write really crappy

3556
00:59:43,270 --> 00:59:43,280
bugs it's so easy to write really crappy
 

3557
00:59:43,280 --> 00:59:47,270
bugs it's so easy to write really crappy
code but it took over all of front-end

3566
00:59:54,870 --> 00:59:54,880
running javascript
 

3567
00:59:54,880 --> 00:59:56,870
running javascript
and it's now taking over much of the

3568
00:59:56,870 --> 00:59:56,880
and it's now taking over much of the
 

3569
00:59:56,880 --> 00:59:59,270

um that are running it so it's like it

01:00:06,950 --> 01:00:06,960
um that are running it so it's like it
 

3579
01:00:06,960 --> 01:00:08,309
um that are running it so it's like it
really took over the world it's very

01:00:08,309 --> 01:00:08,319
really took over the world it's very
 

3581
01:00:08,319 --> 01:00:09,990
really took over the world it's very

uh derided language actually takes

3586
01:00:14,150 --> 01:00:14,160
uh derided language actually takes
 

3587
01:00:14,160 --> 01:00:17,190
uh derided language actually takes
everything over and then the question is

3588
01:00:17,190 --> 01:00:17,200
everything over and then the question is
 

3589
01:00:17,200 --> 01:00:20,470
everything over and then the question is
did human civilization always strive

3590
01:00:20,470 --> 01:00:20,480
did human civilization always strive
 

3591
01:00:20,480 --> 01:00:22,309
did human civilization always strive
towards javascript

3592
01:00:22,309 --> 01:00:22,319
towards javascript
 

3593
01:00:22,319 --> 01:00:24,150
towards javascript
or was javascript just the first

3594
01:00:24,150 --> 01:00:24,160
or was javascript just the first
 

3595
01:00:24,160 --> 01:00:25,589
or was javascript just the first
programming language that ran on the

3596
01:00:25,589 --> 01:00:25,599
programming language that ran on the
 

3597
01:00:25,599 --> 01:00:28,230
programming language that ran on the
browser and still sticky the first the

3598
01:00:28,230 --> 01:00:28,240
browser and still sticky the first the
 

3599
01:00:28,240 --> 01:00:30,470
browser and still sticky the first the
first is the sticky one and so it wins

3600
01:00:30,470 --> 01:00:30,480
first is the sticky one and so it wins
 

3601
01:00:30,480 --> 01:00:32,549
first is the sticky one and so it wins
over anything else because it was first

3602
01:00:32,549 --> 01:00:32,559
over anything else because it was first
 

3603
01:00:32,559 --> 01:00:34,309
over anything else because it was first
and we i don't think that's answerable

3604
01:00:34,309 --> 01:00:34,319
and we i don't think that's answerable
 

3605
01:00:34,319 --> 01:00:36,069
and we i don't think that's answerable
right but it's good to

3606
01:00:36,069 --> 01:00:36,079
right but it's good to
 

3607
01:00:36,079 --> 01:00:38,789
right but it's good to
ask that i suppose in the lab

3608
01:00:38,789 --> 01:00:38,799
ask that i suppose in the lab
 

3609
01:00:38,799 --> 01:00:41,750
ask that i suppose in the lab
you can't you can't

3610
01:00:41,750 --> 01:00:41,760
you can't you can't
 

3611
01:00:41,760 --> 01:00:43,510
you can't you can't
run it with programming languages but in

3612
01:00:43,510 --> 01:00:43,520
run it with programming languages but in
 

3613
01:00:43,520 --> 01:00:46,470
run it with programming languages but in
biology you can probably

3614
01:00:46,470 --> 01:00:46,480
biology you can probably
 

3615
01:00:46,480 --> 01:00:47,750
biology you can probably
do some kind of

3616
01:00:47,750 --> 01:00:47,760
do some kind of
 

3617
01:00:47,760 --> 01:00:48,789
do some kind of
um

3618
01:00:48,789 --> 01:00:48,799

3624
01:00:56,309 --> 01:00:56,319
which yeah i mean in a way we've we've
 

3625
01:00:56,319 --> 01:00:58,549
which yeah i mean in a way we've we've
got the hardware and the software here

3626
01:00:58,549 --> 01:00:58,559
got the hardware and the software here
 

3627
01:00:58,559 --> 01:01:01,190
got the hardware and the software here
and and the the hardware is maybe the

3628
01:01:01,190 --> 01:01:01,200
and and the the hardware is maybe the
 

3629
01:01:01,200 --> 01:01:03,030
and and the the hardware is maybe the
the dna and the rna itself and then the

3630
01:01:03,030 --> 01:01:03,040
the dna and the rna itself and then the
 

3631
01:01:03,040 --> 01:01:05,750
the dna and the rna itself and then the
software perhaps is more about the code

3632
01:01:05,750 --> 01:01:05,760
software perhaps is more about the code
 

3633
01:01:05,760 --> 01:01:07,270
software perhaps is more about the code
is did the code have to be this way

3634
01:01:07,270 --> 01:01:07,280
is did the code have to be this way
 

3635
01:01:07,280 --> 01:01:09,270
is did the code have to be this way
could it have been a different way yeah

3636
01:01:09,270 --> 01:01:09,280
could it have been a different way yeah
 

3637
01:01:09,280 --> 01:01:10,870
could it have been a different way yeah
people talk about the optimization of

3638
01:01:10,870 --> 01:01:10,880
people talk about the optimization of
 

3639
01:01:10,880 --> 01:01:13,030
people talk about the optimization of
the code and there's some suggestion for

3640
01:01:13,030 --> 01:01:13,040
the code and there's some suggestion for
 

3641
01:01:13,040 --> 01:01:15,910
the code and there's some suggestion for
that uh i think it's weak actually

3642
01:01:15,910 --> 01:01:15,920
that uh i think it's weak actually
 

3643
01:01:15,920 --> 01:01:17,430
that uh i think it's weak actually
but you could imagine you could come out

3644
01:01:17,430 --> 01:01:17,440
but you could imagine you could come out
 

3645
01:01:17,440 --> 01:01:19,109
but you could imagine you could come out
with a million different codes and and

3646
01:01:19,109 --> 01:01:19,119
with a million different codes and and
 

3647
01:01:19,119 --> 01:01:21,109
with a million different codes and and
this would be one of the best ones

3648
01:01:21,109 --> 01:01:21,119
this would be one of the best ones
 

3649
01:01:21,119 --> 01:01:22,470
this would be one of the best ones
um

3650
01:01:22,470 --> 01:01:22,480
um
 

3651
01:01:22,480 --> 01:01:25,349
um
well we don't know this well i mean

3652
01:01:25,349 --> 01:01:25,359
well we don't know this well i mean
 

3653
01:01:25,359 --> 01:01:27,829
well we don't know this well i mean
people have tried to model it based on

3654
01:01:27,829 --> 01:01:27,839
people have tried to model it based on
 

3655
01:01:27,839 --> 01:01:30,549
people have tried to model it based on
the effect that mutations would have

3656
01:01:30,549 --> 01:01:30,559
the effect that mutations would have
 

3657
01:01:30,559 --> 01:01:32,309
the effect that mutations would have
um so no you're right we don't know

3658
01:01:32,309 --> 01:01:32,319
um so no you're right we don't know
 

3659
01:01:32,319 --> 01:01:33,589
um so no you're right we don't know
because that's the thing that's a single

3660
01:01:33,589 --> 01:01:33,599
because that's the thing that's a single
 

3661
01:01:33,599 --> 01:01:35,750
because that's the thing that's a single
assumption that a mutation is is what's

3662
01:01:35,750 --> 01:01:35,760
assumption that a mutation is is what's
 

3663
01:01:35,760 --> 01:01:37,990
assumption that a mutation is is what's
being selected on there and there's

3664
01:01:37,990 --> 01:01:38,000
being selected on there and there's
 

3665
01:01:38,000 --> 01:01:39,750
being selected on there and there's
other possibilities too i mean there

3666
01:01:39,750 --> 01:01:39,760
other possibilities too i mean there
 

3667
01:01:39,760 --> 01:01:41,349
other possibilities too i mean there
does seem to be a resilience and a

3668
01:01:41,349 --> 01:01:41,359
does seem to be a resilience and a
 

3669
01:01:41,359 --> 01:01:43,750
does seem to be a resilience and a
redundancy to the whole thing it's hard

3670
01:01:43,750 --> 01:01:43,760
redundancy to the whole thing it's hard
 

3671
01:01:43,760 --> 01:01:45,190
redundancy to the whole thing it's hard
to mess up

3672
01:01:45,190 --> 01:01:45,200
to mess up
 

3673
01:01:45,200 --> 01:01:47,510
to mess up
in in the way you mess it up

3674
01:01:47,510 --> 01:01:47,520
in in the way you mess it up
 

3675
01:01:47,520 --> 01:01:48,549
in in the way you mess it up
often

3676
01:01:48,549 --> 01:01:48,559
often
 

3677
01:01:48,559 --> 01:01:51,430
often
is likely to produce interesting results

3678
01:01:51,430 --> 01:01:51,440
is likely to produce interesting results
 

3679
01:01:51,440 --> 01:01:53,109
is likely to produce interesting results
so it's um are you talking about

3680
01:01:53,109 --> 01:01:53,119
so it's um are you talking about
 

3681
01:01:53,119 --> 01:01:55,349
so it's um are you talking about
javascript or the genetic code now

3682
01:01:55,349 --> 01:01:55,359
javascript or the genetic code now
 

3683
01:01:55,359 --> 01:01:57,670
javascript or the genetic code now
yeah well i mean it's almost you know

3684
01:01:57,670 --> 01:01:57,680
yeah well i mean it's almost you know
 

3685
01:01:57,680 --> 01:01:59,589
yeah well i mean it's almost you know
biology is underpinned by this kind of

3686
01:01:59,589 --> 01:01:59,599
biology is underpinned by this kind of
 

3687
01:01:59,599 --> 01:02:01,190
biology is underpinned by this kind of
mess as well you look at the human

3688
01:02:01,190 --> 01:02:01,200
mess as well you look at the human
 

3689
01:02:01,200 --> 01:02:04,309
mess as well you look at the human
genome and it's full of stuff that is

3690
01:02:04,309 --> 01:02:04,319
genome and it's full of stuff that is
 

3691
01:02:04,319 --> 01:02:06,230
genome and it's full of stuff that is
really either broken or dysfunctional or

3692
01:02:06,230 --> 01:02:06,240
really either broken or dysfunctional or
 

3693
01:02:06,240 --> 01:02:08,069
really either broken or dysfunctional or
was a virus once whatever it may be and

3694
01:02:08,069 --> 01:02:08,079
was a virus once whatever it may be and
 

3695
01:02:08,079 --> 01:02:10,470
was a virus once whatever it may be and
somehow it works and maybe we need a lot

3696
01:02:10,470 --> 01:02:10,480
somehow it works and maybe we need a lot
 

3697
01:02:10,480 --> 01:02:12,309
somehow it works and maybe we need a lot
of this mess you know we know that some

3698
01:02:12,309 --> 01:02:12,319
of this mess you know we know that some
 

3699
01:02:12,319 --> 01:02:13,829
of this mess you know we know that some
functional genes are taken from this

3700
01:02:13,829 --> 01:02:13,839
functional genes are taken from this
 

3701
01:02:13,839 --> 01:02:15,270
functional genes are taken from this
mess

3702
01:02:15,270 --> 01:02:15,280
mess
 

3703
01:02:15,280 --> 01:02:17,589
mess
so what about you mentioned

3704
01:02:17,589 --> 01:02:17,599
so what about you mentioned
 

3705
01:02:17,599 --> 01:02:19,430
so what about you mentioned
predatory behavior

3706
01:02:19,430 --> 01:02:19,440
predatory behavior
 

3707
01:02:19,440 --> 01:02:21,829
predatory behavior
yeah we talked about sex what about

3708
01:02:21,829 --> 01:02:21,839
yeah we talked about sex what about
 

3709
01:02:21,839 --> 01:02:25,910
yeah we talked about sex what about
violence predator and prey dynamics

3710
01:02:25,910 --> 01:02:25,920
violence predator and prey dynamics
 

3711
01:02:25,920 --> 01:02:29,510
violence predator and prey dynamics
how uh when was that invented

3712
01:02:29,510 --> 01:02:29,520
how uh when was that invented
 

3713
01:02:29,520 --> 01:02:30,870
how uh when was that invented
and uh

3714
01:02:30,870 --> 01:02:30,880
and uh
 

3715
01:02:30,880 --> 01:02:33,109
and uh
poetic and biological ways of putting it

3716
01:02:33,109 --> 01:02:33,119
poetic and biological ways of putting it
 

3717
01:02:33,119 --> 01:02:35,510
poetic and biological ways of putting it
like what how do you describe a

3718
01:02:35,510 --> 01:02:35,520
like what how do you describe a
 

3719
01:02:35,520 --> 01:02:37,670
like what how do you describe a
predator-prey relationship is it a

3720
01:02:37,670 --> 01:02:37,680
predator-prey relationship is it a
 

3721
01:02:37,680 --> 01:02:40,150
predator-prey relationship is it a
beautiful dance or is it a

3722
01:02:40,150 --> 01:02:40,160
beautiful dance or is it a
 

3723
01:02:40,160 --> 01:02:42,870
beautiful dance or is it a
violent atrocity

3724
01:02:42,870 --> 01:02:42,880
violent atrocity
 

3725
01:02:42,880 --> 01:02:44,470
violent atrocity
well i guess it's both isn't it i mean

3726
01:02:44,470 --> 01:02:44,480
well i guess it's both isn't it i mean
 

3727
01:02:44,480 --> 01:02:46,870
well i guess it's both isn't it i mean
when does it start it starts in bacteria

3728
01:02:46,870 --> 01:02:46,880
when does it start it starts in bacteria
 

3729
01:02:46,880 --> 01:02:49,349
when does it start it starts in bacteria
you see these amazing predators

3730
01:02:49,349 --> 01:02:49,359
you see these amazing predators
 

3731
01:02:49,359 --> 01:02:51,589
you see these amazing predators
delivibrio is one that lynne margulis

3732
01:02:51,589 --> 01:02:51,599
delivibrio is one that lynne margulis
 

3733
01:02:51,599 --> 01:02:54,230
delivibrio is one that lynne margulis
used to talk about a lot um it's it's

3734
01:02:54,230 --> 01:02:54,240
used to talk about a lot um it's it's
 

3735
01:02:54,240 --> 01:02:56,390
used to talk about a lot um it's it's
got a kind of a drill piece that drills

3736
01:02:56,390 --> 01:02:56,400
got a kind of a drill piece that drills
 

3737
01:02:56,400 --> 01:02:58,069
got a kind of a drill piece that drills
through the wall and the membrane of the

3738
01:02:58,069 --> 01:02:58,079
through the wall and the membrane of the
 

3739
01:02:58,079 --> 01:02:59,750
through the wall and the membrane of the
bacterium and then it effectively eats

3740
01:02:59,750 --> 01:02:59,760
bacterium and then it effectively eats
 

3741
01:02:59,760 --> 01:03:01,990
bacterium and then it effectively eats
the bacterium from just inside the

3742
01:03:01,990 --> 01:03:02,000
the bacterium from just inside the
 

3743
01:03:02,000 --> 01:03:04,230
the bacterium from just inside the
periplasmic space and makes copies of

3744
01:03:04,230 --> 01:03:04,240
periplasmic space and makes copies of
 

3745
01:03:04,240 --> 01:03:05,750
periplasmic space and makes copies of
itself that way so that's straight

3746
01:03:05,750 --> 01:03:05,760
itself that way so that's straight
 

3747
01:03:05,760 --> 01:03:07,190
itself that way so that's straight
predation there are predators among

3748
01:03:07,190 --> 01:03:07,200
predation there are predators among
 

3749
01:03:07,200 --> 01:03:08,309
predation there are predators among
bacteria

3750
01:03:08,309 --> 01:03:08,319
bacteria
 

3751
01:03:08,319 --> 01:03:10,230
bacteria
so predation in that sorry to interrupt

3752
01:03:10,230 --> 01:03:10,240
so predation in that sorry to interrupt
 

3753
01:03:10,240 --> 01:03:11,270
so predation in that sorry to interrupt
means

3754
01:03:11,270 --> 01:03:11,280
means
 

3755
01:03:11,280 --> 01:03:13,349
means
you murder somebody and

3756
01:03:13,349 --> 01:03:13,359
you murder somebody and
 

3757
01:03:13,359 --> 01:03:15,829
you murder somebody and
use their body as a resource

3758
01:03:15,829 --> 01:03:15,839
use their body as a resource
 

3759
01:03:15,839 --> 01:03:17,510
use their body as a resource
in some way

3760
01:03:17,510 --> 01:03:17,520
in some way
 

3761
01:03:17,520 --> 01:03:20,870
in some way
yeah but it's not parasitic

3762
01:03:20,870 --> 01:03:20,880
yeah but it's not parasitic
 

3763
01:03:20,880 --> 01:03:23,349
yeah but it's not parasitic
in that you need them to be still alive

3764
01:03:23,349 --> 01:03:23,359
in that you need them to be still alive
 

3765
01:03:23,359 --> 01:03:25,910
in that you need them to be still alive
no no i mean predation is you kill them

3766
01:03:25,910 --> 01:03:25,920
no no i mean predation is you kill them
 

3767
01:03:25,920 --> 01:03:28,630
no no i mean predation is you kill them
really murder parasite is so you kind of

3768
01:03:28,630 --> 01:03:28,640
really murder parasite is so you kind of
 

3769
01:03:28,640 --> 01:03:31,910
really murder parasite is so you kind of
live on them okay so but it seems the

3770
01:03:31,910 --> 01:03:31,920
live on them okay so but it seems the
 

3771
01:03:31,920 --> 01:03:34,309
live on them okay so but it seems the
predator is really popular

3772
01:03:34,309 --> 01:03:34,319
predator is really popular
 

3773
01:03:34,319 --> 01:03:35,589
predator is really popular
uh um

3774
01:03:35,589 --> 01:03:35,599
uh um
 

3775
01:03:35,599 --> 01:03:38,430
uh um
so what we see if we go back

3776
01:03:38,430 --> 01:03:38,440
so what we see if we go back
 

3777
01:03:38,440 --> 01:03:42,069
so what we see if we go back
560 570 million years

3778
01:03:42,069 --> 01:03:42,079
560 570 million years
 

3779
01:03:42,079 --> 01:03:45,270
560 570 million years
before the cambrian explosion there is

3780
01:03:45,270 --> 01:03:45,280
before the cambrian explosion there is
 

3781
01:03:45,280 --> 01:03:46,150
before the cambrian explosion there is
um

3782
01:03:46,150 --> 01:03:46,160
um
 

3783
01:03:46,160 --> 01:03:48,549
um
what's known as the ediacaran fauna or

3784
01:03:48,549 --> 01:03:48,559
what's known as the ediacaran fauna or
 

3785
01:03:48,559 --> 01:03:50,390
what's known as the ediacaran fauna or
sometimes they call vendo bions which is

3786
01:03:50,390 --> 01:03:50,400
sometimes they call vendo bions which is
 

3787
01:03:50,400 --> 01:03:51,670
sometimes they call vendo bions which is
a lovely name

3788
01:03:51,670 --> 01:03:51,680
a lovely name
 

3789
01:03:51,680 --> 01:03:53,910
a lovely name
uh and and it's not obvious that they're

3790
01:03:53,910 --> 01:03:53,920
uh and and it's not obvious that they're
 

3791
01:03:53,920 --> 01:03:55,270
uh and and it's not obvious that they're
animals at all

3792
01:03:55,270 --> 01:03:55,280
animals at all
 

3793
01:03:55,280 --> 01:03:57,190
animals at all
uh they're stalked things they often

3794
01:03:57,190 --> 01:03:57,200
uh they're stalked things they often
 

3795
01:03:57,200 --> 01:03:59,109
uh they're stalked things they often
have fronds that look a lot like leaves

3796
01:03:59,109 --> 01:03:59,119
have fronds that look a lot like leaves
 

3797
01:03:59,119 --> 01:04:01,430
have fronds that look a lot like leaves
with kind of fractal branching patterns

3798
01:04:01,430 --> 01:04:01,440
with kind of fractal branching patterns
 

3799
01:04:01,440 --> 01:04:03,109
with kind of fractal branching patterns
on them um

3800
01:04:03,109 --> 01:04:03,119
on them um
 

3801
01:04:03,119 --> 01:04:04,710
on them um
and

3802
01:04:04,710 --> 01:04:04,720
and
 

3803
01:04:04,720 --> 01:04:06,549
and
the thing is they've they're found

3804
01:04:06,549 --> 01:04:06,559
the thing is they've they're found
 

3805
01:04:06,559 --> 01:04:07,910
the thing is they've they're found
sometimes

3806
01:04:07,910 --> 01:04:07,920
sometimes
 

3807
01:04:07,920 --> 01:04:09,829
sometimes
geologists can figure out the

3808
01:04:09,829 --> 01:04:09,839
geologists can figure out the
 

3809
01:04:09,839 --> 01:04:11,750
geologists can figure out the
environment that they were in and say

3810
01:04:11,750 --> 01:04:11,760
environment that they were in and say
 

3811
01:04:11,760 --> 01:04:13,349
environment that they were in and say
this is more than 200 meters deep

3812
01:04:13,349 --> 01:04:13,359
this is more than 200 meters deep
 

3813
01:04:13,359 --> 01:04:15,270
this is more than 200 meters deep
because there's no sign of any waves

3814
01:04:15,270 --> 01:04:15,280
because there's no sign of any waves
 

3815
01:04:15,280 --> 01:04:16,470
because there's no sign of any waves
there's no you know

3816
01:04:16,470 --> 01:04:16,480
there's no you know
 

3817
01:04:16,480 --> 01:04:18,230
there's no you know
no storm damage down here this kind of

3818
01:04:18,230 --> 01:04:18,240
no storm damage down here this kind of
 

3819
01:04:18,240 --> 01:04:19,270
no storm damage down here this kind of
thing

3820
01:04:19,270 --> 01:04:19,280
thing
 

3821
01:04:19,280 --> 01:04:20,789
thing
they were more than 200 meters deep so

3822
01:04:20,789 --> 01:04:20,799
they were more than 200 meters deep so
 

3823
01:04:20,799 --> 01:04:22,710
they were more than 200 meters deep so
they're definitely not photosynthetic

3824
01:04:22,710 --> 01:04:22,720
they're definitely not photosynthetic
 

3825
01:04:22,720 --> 01:04:24,950
they're definitely not photosynthetic
these are animals

3826
01:04:24,950 --> 01:04:24,960
these are animals
 

3827
01:04:24,960 --> 01:04:26,470
these are animals
and they're they're filter feeders and

3828
01:04:26,470 --> 01:04:26,480
and they're they're filter feeders and
 

3829
01:04:26,480 --> 01:04:27,910
and they're they're filter feeders and
we know things you know sponges and

3830
01:04:27,910 --> 01:04:27,920
we know things you know sponges and
 

3831
01:04:27,920 --> 01:04:29,510
we know things you know sponges and
corals and things are filter-feeding

3832
01:04:29,510 --> 01:04:29,520
corals and things are filter-feeding
 

3833
01:04:29,520 --> 01:04:31,990
corals and things are filter-feeding
animals they're stuck to the spot uh and

3834
01:04:31,990 --> 01:04:32,000
animals they're stuck to the spot uh and
 

3835
01:04:32,000 --> 01:04:33,510
animals they're stuck to the spot uh and
little bits of carbon that come their

3836
01:04:33,510 --> 01:04:33,520
little bits of carbon that come their
 

3837
01:04:33,520 --> 01:04:35,190
little bits of carbon that come their
way they they filter it out and that's

3838
01:04:35,190 --> 01:04:35,200
way they they filter it out and that's
 

3839
01:04:35,200 --> 01:04:36,789
way they they filter it out and that's
what they're eating

3840
01:04:36,789 --> 01:04:36,799
what they're eating
 

3841
01:04:36,799 --> 01:04:39,349
what they're eating
um so no predation involved in this

3842
01:04:39,349 --> 01:04:39,359
um so no predation involved in this
 

3843
01:04:39,359 --> 01:04:41,670
um so no predation involved in this
beyond stuff just dies anyway and it

3844
01:04:41,670 --> 01:04:41,680
beyond stuff just dies anyway and it
 

3845
01:04:41,680 --> 01:04:43,190
beyond stuff just dies anyway and it
feels like a very gentle rather

3846
01:04:43,190 --> 01:04:43,200
feels like a very gentle rather
 

3847
01:04:43,200 --> 01:04:45,670
feels like a very gentle rather
beautiful rather limited world you might

3848
01:04:45,670 --> 01:04:45,680
beautiful rather limited world you might
 

3849
01:04:45,680 --> 01:04:46,470
beautiful rather limited world you might
say

3850
01:04:46,470 --> 01:04:46,480
say
 

3851
01:04:46,480 --> 01:04:49,349
say
there's not a lot going on there

3852
01:04:49,349 --> 01:04:49,359
there's not a lot going on there
 

3853
01:04:49,359 --> 01:04:51,109
there's not a lot going on there
and

3854
01:04:51,109 --> 01:04:51,119
and
 

3855
01:04:51,119 --> 01:04:52,630
and
something changes

3856
01:04:52,630 --> 01:04:52,640
something changes
 

3857
01:04:52,640 --> 01:04:54,390
something changes
oxygen definitely changes during this

3858
01:04:54,390 --> 01:04:54,400
oxygen definitely changes during this
 

3859
01:04:54,400 --> 01:04:55,910
oxygen definitely changes during this
period other things may have changed as

3860
01:04:55,910 --> 01:04:55,920
period other things may have changed as
 

3861
01:04:55,920 --> 01:04:57,829
period other things may have changed as
well but the next thing you really see

3862
01:04:57,829 --> 01:04:57,839
well but the next thing you really see
 

3863
01:04:57,839 --> 01:04:59,829
well but the next thing you really see
in the fossil record is the cambrian

3864
01:04:59,829 --> 01:04:59,839
in the fossil record is the cambrian
 

3865
01:04:59,839 --> 01:05:01,109
in the fossil record is the cambrian
explosion

3866
01:05:01,109 --> 01:05:01,119
explosion
 

3867
01:05:01,119 --> 01:05:02,630
explosion
and what do we see there

3868
01:05:02,630 --> 01:05:02,640
and what do we see there
 

3869
01:05:02,640 --> 01:05:04,230
and what do we see there
we're now seeing animals that we would

3870
01:05:04,230 --> 01:05:04,240
we're now seeing animals that we would
 

3871
01:05:04,240 --> 01:05:06,870
we're now seeing animals that we would
recognize they've got eyes they've got

3872
01:05:06,870 --> 01:05:06,880
recognize they've got eyes they've got
 

3873
01:05:06,880 --> 01:05:08,950
recognize they've got eyes they've got
claws they've got shells they're you

3874
01:05:08,950 --> 01:05:08,960
claws they've got shells they're you
 

3875
01:05:08,960 --> 01:05:10,789
claws they've got shells they're you
know they're plainly killing things or

3876
01:05:10,789 --> 01:05:10,799
know they're plainly killing things or
 

3877
01:05:10,799 --> 01:05:12,230
know they're plainly killing things or
running away

3878
01:05:12,230 --> 01:05:12,240
running away
 

3879
01:05:12,240 --> 01:05:16,230
running away
um and and hiding um and and so we've

3880
01:05:16,230 --> 01:05:16,240
um and and hiding um and and so we've
 

3881
01:05:16,240 --> 01:05:18,789
um and and hiding um and and so we've
gone from a rather gentle but limited

3882
01:05:18,789 --> 01:05:18,799
gone from a rather gentle but limited
 

3883
01:05:18,799 --> 01:05:22,230
gone from a rather gentle but limited
world to a rather vicious unpleasant

3884
01:05:22,230 --> 01:05:22,240
world to a rather vicious unpleasant
 

3885
01:05:22,240 --> 01:05:24,470
world to a rather vicious unpleasant
world that we recognize

3886
01:05:24,470 --> 01:05:24,480
world that we recognize
 

3887
01:05:24,480 --> 01:05:27,510
world that we recognize
and which leads to

3888
01:05:27,510 --> 01:05:27,520
and which leads to
 

3889
01:05:27,520 --> 01:05:29,510
and which leads to
kind of arms races evolutionary arms

3890
01:05:29,510 --> 01:05:29,520
kind of arms races evolutionary arms
 

3891
01:05:29,520 --> 01:05:31,109
kind of arms races evolutionary arms
races

3892
01:05:31,109 --> 01:05:31,119
races
 

3893
01:05:31,119 --> 01:05:32,630
races
which again is something that when we

3894
01:05:32,630 --> 01:05:32,640
which again is something that when we
 

3895
01:05:32,640 --> 01:05:34,309
which again is something that when we
think about a nuclear arms race we think

3896
01:05:34,309 --> 01:05:34,319
think about a nuclear arms race we think
 

3897
01:05:34,319 --> 01:05:36,390
think about a nuclear arms race we think
jesus we don't want to go there it's not

01:05:36,390 --> 01:05:36,400
jesus we don't want to go there it's not
 

3899
01:05:36,400 --> 01:05:38,390

done anybody any good

01:05:38,390 --> 01:05:38,400
done anybody any good
 

3901
01:05:38,400 --> 01:05:40,710
done anybody any good
in some ways maybe we maybe it does do

01:05:40,710 --> 01:05:40,720
in some ways maybe we maybe it does do

01:05:40,720 --> 01:05:42,789
in some ways maybe we maybe it does do
good i don't want to make an argument

3904
01:05:42,789 --> 01:05:42,799
good i don't want to make an argument
 

3905
01:05:42,799 --> 01:05:46,309
good i don't want to make an argument
for nuclear arms but but predation

3906
01:05:46,309 --> 01:05:46,319
for nuclear arms but but predation
 

3907
01:05:46,319 --> 01:05:48,630
for nuclear arms but but predation
as a as a mechanism

3908
01:05:48,630 --> 01:05:48,640
as a as a mechanism
 

3909
01:05:48,640 --> 01:05:50,630
as a as a mechanism

01:05:50,630 --> 01:05:50,640
forces organisms to adapt to change to

be better to escape to to or to kill um
 

3913
01:05:54,000 --> 01:05:55,589
be better to escape to to or to kill um
if you need to eat then you've got to

3914
01:05:55,589 --> 01:05:55,599
if you need to eat then you've got to
 

3915
01:05:55,599 --> 01:05:56,870
if you need to eat then you've got to
eat and you know a cheetah is not going

3916
01:05:56,870 --> 01:05:56,880
eat and you know a cheetah is not going
 

3917
01:05:56,880 --> 01:05:59,029
eat and you know a cheetah is not going
to run at that speed unless it's

3918
01:05:59,029 --> 01:05:59,039
to run at that speed unless it's
 

3919
01:05:59,039 --> 01:06:01,750
to run at that speed unless it's
unless it has to because the the zebra

3920
01:06:01,750 --> 01:06:01,760
unless it has to because the the zebra
 

3921
01:06:01,760 --> 01:06:05,510
unless it has to because the the zebra
is capable of escaping so it leads to

3922
01:06:05,510 --> 01:06:05,520
is capable of escaping so it leads to
 

3923
01:06:05,520 --> 01:06:07,750
is capable of escaping so it leads to
to much greater feats of evolution than

3924
01:06:07,750 --> 01:06:07,760
to much greater feats of evolution than
 

3925
01:06:07,760 --> 01:06:09,750
to much greater feats of evolution than
would ever have been possible without it

3926
01:06:09,750 --> 01:06:09,760
would ever have been possible without it
 

3927
01:06:09,760 --> 01:06:11,589
would ever have been possible without it
and in the end to a much more beautiful

3928
01:06:11,589 --> 01:06:11,599
and in the end to a much more beautiful
 

3929
01:06:11,599 --> 01:06:12,870
and in the end to a much more beautiful
world

3930
01:06:12,870 --> 01:06:12,880
world
 

3931
01:06:12,880 --> 01:06:13,829
world
and so

3932
01:06:13,829 --> 01:06:13,839
and so
 

3933
01:06:13,839 --> 01:06:16,230
and so
it's not all bad

3934
01:06:16,230 --> 01:06:16,240
it's not all bad
 

3935
01:06:16,240 --> 01:06:18,309
it's not all bad
by any means the the but the thing is

3936
01:06:18,309 --> 01:06:18,319
by any means the the but the thing is
 

3937
01:06:18,319 --> 01:06:19,990
by any means the the but the thing is
you can't have this if you don't have an

3938
01:06:19,990 --> 01:06:20,000
you can't have this if you don't have an
 

3939
01:06:20,000 --> 01:06:21,990
you can't have this if you don't have an
oxygenated planet because if you it's

3940
01:06:21,990 --> 01:06:22,000
oxygenated planet because if you it's
 

3941
01:06:22,000 --> 01:06:23,589
oxygenated planet because if you it's
all in the end it's about how much

3942
01:06:23,589 --> 01:06:23,599
all in the end it's about how much
 

3943
01:06:23,599 --> 01:06:25,349
all in the end it's about how much
energy can you extract from the food you

3944
01:06:25,349 --> 01:06:25,359
energy can you extract from the food you
 

3945
01:06:25,359 --> 01:06:26,470
energy can you extract from the food you
eat

3946
01:06:26,470 --> 01:06:26,480
eat
 

3947
01:06:26,480 --> 01:06:27,990
eat
and if you don't have an oxygenated

3948
01:06:27,990 --> 01:06:28,000
and if you don't have an oxygenated
 

3949
01:06:28,000 --> 01:06:30,230
and if you don't have an oxygenated
planet you can get about 10

3950
01:06:30,230 --> 01:06:30,240
planet you can get about 10
 

3951
01:06:30,240 --> 01:06:32,630
planet you can get about 10
out not much more than that um and if

3952
01:06:32,630 --> 01:06:32,640
out not much more than that um and if
 

3953
01:06:32,640 --> 01:06:34,150
out not much more than that um and if
you've got an oxygenated planet you can

3954
01:06:34,150 --> 01:06:34,160
you've got an oxygenated planet you can
 

3955
01:06:34,160 --> 01:06:36,710
you've got an oxygenated planet you can
get about 40 out and that means you can

3956
01:06:36,710 --> 01:06:36,720
get about 40 out and that means you can
 

3957
01:06:36,720 --> 01:06:39,270
get about 40 out and that means you can
have instead of having one or two trophy

3958
01:06:39,270 --> 01:06:39,280
have instead of having one or two trophy
 

3959
01:06:39,280 --> 01:06:40,390
have instead of having one or two trophy
levels

3960
01:06:40,390 --> 01:06:40,400
levels
 

3961
01:06:40,400 --> 01:06:42,630
levels
you can have five or six trophies levels

3962
01:06:42,630 --> 01:06:42,640
you can have five or six trophies levels
 

3963
01:06:42,640 --> 01:06:44,150
you can have five or six trophies levels
and that means things can eat things

3964
01:06:44,150 --> 01:06:44,160
and that means things can eat things
 

3965
01:06:44,160 --> 01:06:46,230
and that means things can eat things
that eat other things and so on and and

3966
01:06:46,230 --> 01:06:46,240
that eat other things and so on and and
 

3967
01:06:46,240 --> 01:06:48,230
that eat other things and so on and and
you've gone to a level of ecological

3968
01:06:48,230 --> 01:06:48,240
you've gone to a level of ecological
 

3969
01:06:48,240 --> 01:06:49,430
you've gone to a level of ecological
complexity which is completely

3970
01:06:49,430 --> 01:06:49,440
complexity which is completely
 

3971
01:06:49,440 --> 01:06:51,589
complexity which is completely
impossible in the absence of oxygen

3972
01:06:51,589 --> 01:06:51,599
impossible in the absence of oxygen
 

3973
01:06:51,599 --> 01:06:53,430
impossible in the absence of oxygen
this reminds me of the hunter s thompson

3974
01:06:53,430 --> 01:06:53,440
this reminds me of the hunter s thompson
 

3975
01:06:53,440 --> 01:06:56,630
this reminds me of the hunter s thompson

just the trillions and trillions of

01:07:17,670 --> 01:07:17,680
in the in this struggle it's a sorry
 

3993
01:07:17,680 --> 01:07:20,309
in the in this struggle it's a sorry

you channel that into more
 

4089
01:08:59,279 --> 01:09:01,110
you channel that into more

is because evolution is very wasteful

like the amount of murder required to
really test the good idea yeah

know in in in ancient greece we had we

01:09:39,030 --> 01:09:39,040
know in in in ancient greece we had we
 

4129
01:09:39,040 --> 01:09:41,669

4133
01:09:43,040 --> 01:09:45,829

you know universities compete with each

4136
01:09:47,510 --> 01:09:47,520
you know universities compete with each
 

4137
01:09:47,520 --> 01:09:49,510
you know universities compete with each
other yes tremendous amounts of

4138
01:09:49,510 --> 01:09:49,520
other yes tremendous amounts of
 

4139
01:09:49,520 --> 01:09:51,110
other yes tremendous amounts of
companies competing with each other all

4140

the time it it drives innovation um
 

4143
01:09:54,960 --> 01:09:56,870
the time it it drives innovation um
and if we want to do it without all the

4144
01:09:56,870 --> 01:09:56,880
and if we want to do it without all the
 

4145
01:09:56,880 --> 01:09:59,590
and if we want to do it without all the
death that we see in nature then we have

4146
01:09:59,590 --> 01:09:59,600
death that we see in nature then we have
 

4147
01:09:59,600 --> 01:10:02,470
death that we see in nature then we have
to have some kind of societal level

4148
01:10:02,470 --> 01:10:02,480
to have some kind of societal level
 

4149
01:10:02,480 --> 01:10:04,709
to have some kind of societal level
control that says well hit the some

4152
01:10:05,990 --> 01:10:06,000
limits guys and these are what the
 

4153
01:10:06,000 --> 01:10:07,910
limits guys and these are what the
limits are going to be and society as a

4154
01:10:07,910 --> 01:10:07,920
limits are going to be and society as a
 

4155
01:10:07,920 --> 01:10:09,669
limits are going to be and society as a
whole has to say right we want to limit

4156
01:10:09,669 --> 01:10:09,679
whole has to say right we want to limit
 

4157
01:10:09,679 --> 01:10:11,590
whole has to say right we want to limit
the amount of death here so you can't do

4158
01:10:11,590 --> 01:10:11,600
the amount of death here so you can't do
 

4159
01:10:11,600 --> 01:10:13,030
the amount of death here so you can't do
this and you can't do that and you know

4160
01:10:13,030 --> 01:10:13,040
this and you can't do that and you know
 

4161
01:10:13,040 --> 01:10:14,630
this and you can't do that and you know
who makes up these rules and how do we

4162
01:10:14,630 --> 01:10:14,640
who makes up these rules and how do we
 

4163
01:10:14,640 --> 01:10:16,310
who makes up these rules and how do we
know it's it's a tough thing but it's

4164
01:10:16,310 --> 01:10:16,320
know it's it's a tough thing but it's
 

4165
01:10:16,320 --> 01:10:19,350
know it's it's a tough thing but it's
basically trying to find a moral basis

4166
01:10:19,350 --> 01:10:19,360
basically trying to find a moral basis
 

4167
01:10:19,360 --> 01:10:21,590
basically trying to find a moral basis
for avoiding the death of evolution and

4168
01:10:21,590 --> 01:10:21,600
for avoiding the death of evolution and
 

4169
01:10:21,600 --> 01:10:24,470
for avoiding the death of evolution and
natural selection and keeping the the

4170
01:10:24,470 --> 01:10:24,480
natural selection and keeping the the
 

4171
01:10:24,480 --> 01:10:26,390
natural selection and keeping the the
the innovation and the and the richness

4172
01:10:26,390 --> 01:10:26,400
the innovation and the and the richness
 

4173
01:10:26,400 --> 01:10:27,350
the innovation and the and the richness
of it

4174
01:10:27,350 --> 01:10:27,360
of it
 

4175
01:10:27,360 --> 01:10:30,310
of it
i forgot who said it but

4176
01:10:30,310 --> 01:10:30,320
i forgot who said it but
 

4177
01:10:30,320 --> 01:10:32,229
i forgot who said it but
that murder is illegal probably current

4178
01:10:32,229 --> 01:10:32,239
that murder is illegal probably current
 

4179
01:10:32,239 --> 01:10:34,870
that murder is illegal probably current
finding it murder is illegal except when

4180
01:10:34,870 --> 01:10:34,880
finding it murder is illegal except when
 

4181
01:10:34,880 --> 01:10:36,630
finding it murder is illegal except when
it's done to the sound of trumpets and

4182
01:10:36,630 --> 01:10:36,640
it's done to the sound of trumpets and
 

4183
01:10:36,640 --> 01:10:38,149
it's done to the sound of trumpets and
at a large scale

4184
01:10:38,149 --> 01:10:38,159
at a large scale
 

4185
01:10:38,159 --> 01:10:41,590
at a large scale
so we still have wars

4186
01:10:41,590 --> 01:10:41,600
so we still have wars
 

4187
01:10:41,600 --> 01:10:44,070
so we still have wars
but we are struggling with this idea

4188
01:10:44,070 --> 01:10:44,080
but we are struggling with this idea
 

4189
01:10:44,080 --> 01:10:47,189
but we are struggling with this idea
that murder is a bad thing

4190
01:10:47,189 --> 01:10:47,199
that murder is a bad thing
 

4191
01:10:47,199 --> 01:10:49,669
that murder is a bad thing
it's so interesting how we're channeling

4192
01:10:49,669 --> 01:10:49,679
it's so interesting how we're channeling
 

4193
01:10:49,679 --> 01:10:50,630
it's so interesting how we're channeling
the best

4194
01:10:50,630 --> 01:10:50,640
the best
 

4195
01:10:50,640 --> 01:10:53,189
the best
of the evolutionary imperative

4196
01:10:53,189 --> 01:10:53,199
of the evolutionary imperative
 

4197
01:10:53,199 --> 01:10:56,390
of the evolutionary imperative
and trying to um get rid of the stuff

4198
01:10:56,390 --> 01:10:56,400
and trying to um get rid of the stuff
 

4199
01:10:56,400 --> 01:10:58,470
and trying to um get rid of the stuff
that's not productive

4200
01:10:58,470 --> 01:10:58,480
that's not productive
 

4201
01:10:58,480 --> 01:11:00,470
that's not productive
trying to almost accelerate evolution

4202
01:11:00,470 --> 01:11:00,480
trying to almost accelerate evolution
 

4203
01:11:00,480 --> 01:11:01,830
trying to almost accelerate evolution
the same kind of

4204
01:11:01,830 --> 01:11:01,840
the same kind of
 

4205
01:11:01,840 --> 01:11:04,070
the same kind of
thing that um

4206
01:11:04,070 --> 01:11:04,080
thing that um
 

4207
01:11:04,080 --> 01:11:06,070
thing that um
uh makes evolution creative we're trying

4208
01:11:06,070 --> 01:11:06,080
uh makes evolution creative we're trying
 

4209
01:11:06,080 --> 01:11:08,550
uh makes evolution creative we're trying
to use that i think we naturally do it i

4210
01:11:08,550 --> 01:11:08,560
to use that i think we naturally do it i
 

4211
01:11:08,560 --> 01:11:10,070
to use that i think we naturally do it i
mean i don't think we can help ourselves

4212
01:11:10,070 --> 01:11:10,080
mean i don't think we can help ourselves
 

4213
01:11:10,080 --> 01:11:12,550
mean i don't think we can help ourselves
do it and you know capitalism capitalism

4214
01:11:12,550 --> 01:11:12,560
do it and you know capitalism capitalism
 

4215
01:11:12,560 --> 01:11:14,310
do it and you know capitalism capitalism
as a form is is basically about

4216
01:11:14,310 --> 01:11:14,320
as a form is is basically about
 

4217
01:11:14,320 --> 01:11:17,110
as a form is is basically about
competition and and differential rewards

4218
01:11:17,110 --> 01:11:17,120
competition and and differential rewards
 

4219
01:11:17,120 --> 01:11:18,870
competition and and differential rewards
but

4220
01:11:18,870 --> 01:11:18,880
but
 

4221
01:11:18,880 --> 01:11:22,790
but
we society and you know we have a

4222
01:11:22,790 --> 01:11:22,800
we society and you know we have a
 

4223
01:11:22,800 --> 01:11:25,030
we society and you know we have a
i keep using this world moral obligation

4224
01:11:25,030 --> 01:11:25,040
i keep using this world moral obligation
 

4225
01:11:25,040 --> 01:11:27,990
i keep using this world moral obligation
but you know we cannot operate as a

4226
01:11:27,990 --> 01:11:28,000
but you know we cannot operate as a
 

4227
01:11:28,000 --> 01:11:29,830
but you know we cannot operate as a
society if we go that way it's

4228
01:11:29,830 --> 01:11:29,840
society if we go that way it's
 

4229
01:11:29,840 --> 01:11:32,550
society if we go that way it's
interesting that

4230
01:11:32,550 --> 01:11:32,560

 

4231
01:11:32,560 --> 01:11:35,270

we've had problems achieving balance so

4232
01:11:35,270 --> 01:11:35,280
we've had problems achieving balance so
 

4233
01:11:35,280 --> 01:11:37,270
we've had problems achieving balance so
for example in the in the financial

4234
01:11:37,270 --> 01:11:37,280
for example in the in the financial
 

4235
01:11:37,280 --> 01:11:39,189
for example in the in the financial
crash in 2009

4236
01:11:39,189 --> 01:11:39,199
crash in 2009
 

4237
01:11:39,199 --> 01:11:41,110
crash in 2009
do you let banks go to the wall or not

4238
01:11:41,110 --> 01:11:41,120
do you let banks go to the wall or not
 

4239
01:11:41,120 --> 01:11:43,510
do you let banks go to the wall or not
this kind of question in evolution

4240
01:11:43,510 --> 01:11:43,520
this kind of question in evolution
 

4241
01:11:43,520 --> 01:11:44,950
this kind of question in evolution
certainly you let them go to the wall

4242
01:11:44,950 --> 01:11:44,960
certainly you let them go to the wall
 

4243
01:11:44,960 --> 01:11:46,709
certainly you let them go to the wall
and in that sense you don't need the

4244
01:11:46,709 --> 01:11:46,719
and in that sense you don't need the
 

4245
01:11:46,719 --> 01:11:51,270
and in that sense you don't need the
regulation because they just die

4246
01:11:51,270 --> 01:11:51,280

 

4247
01:11:51,280 --> 01:11:52,790

whereas if we

4248
01:11:52,790 --> 01:11:52,800
whereas if we
 

4249
01:11:52,800 --> 01:11:55,110
whereas if we
as a society think about what's required

4250
01:11:55,110 --> 01:11:55,120
as a society think about what's required
 

4251
01:11:55,120 --> 01:11:56,790
as a society think about what's required
for society as a whole then you don't

4252
01:11:56,790 --> 01:11:56,800
for society as a whole then you don't
 

4253
01:11:56,800 --> 01:11:58,870
for society as a whole then you don't
necessarily let them go to the wall

4254
01:11:58,870 --> 01:11:58,880
necessarily let them go to the wall
 

4255
01:11:58,880 --> 01:12:01,350
necessarily let them go to the wall
uh in which case you then have to impose

4256
01:12:01,350 --> 01:12:01,360
uh in which case you then have to impose
 

4257
01:12:01,360 --> 01:12:04,229
uh in which case you then have to impose
some kind of regulation that the bankers

4258
01:12:04,229 --> 01:12:04,239
some kind of regulation that the bankers
 

4259
01:12:04,239 --> 01:12:06,070
some kind of regulation that the bankers
themselves will in an evolutionary

4260
01:12:06,070 --> 01:12:06,080
themselves will in an evolutionary
 

4261
01:12:06,080 --> 01:12:08,070
themselves will in an evolutionary
manner exploit

4262
01:12:08,070 --> 01:12:08,080
manner exploit
 

4263
01:12:08,080 --> 01:12:10,070
manner exploit
yeah it's we've been struggling with

4264
01:12:10,070 --> 01:12:10,080
yeah it's we've been struggling with
 

4265
01:12:10,080 --> 01:12:13,270
yeah it's we've been struggling with
this kind of idea of capitalism

4266
01:12:13,270 --> 01:12:13,280
this kind of idea of capitalism
 

4267
01:12:13,280 --> 01:12:15,990
this kind of idea of capitalism
the the the cold brutality of capitalism

4268
01:12:15,990 --> 01:12:16,000
the the the cold brutality of capitalism
 

4269
01:12:16,000 --> 01:12:18,149
the the the cold brutality of capitalism
that seems to create so much

4270
01:12:18,149 --> 01:12:18,159
that seems to create so much
 

4271
01:12:18,159 --> 01:12:20,229
that seems to create so much
beautiful things in this world

4272
01:12:20,229 --> 01:12:20,239
beautiful things in this world
 

4273
01:12:20,239 --> 01:12:21,350
beautiful things in this world
and then the

4274
01:12:21,350 --> 01:12:21,360
and then the
 

4275
01:12:21,360 --> 01:12:23,590
and then the
the ideals of communism that seem to

4276
01:12:23,590 --> 01:12:23,600
the ideals of communism that seem to
 

4277
01:12:23,600 --> 01:12:25,669
the ideals of communism that seem to
create so much brutal destruction in

4278
01:12:25,669 --> 01:12:25,679
create so much brutal destruction in
 

4279
01:12:25,679 --> 01:12:28,310
create so much brutal destruction in
history and we struggle with ideas

4280
01:12:28,310 --> 01:12:28,320
history and we struggle with ideas
 

4281
01:12:28,320 --> 01:12:30,550
history and we struggle with ideas
of well maybe we didn't do it right how

4282
01:12:30,550 --> 01:12:30,560
of well maybe we didn't do it right how
 

4283
01:12:30,560 --> 01:12:32,149
of well maybe we didn't do it right how
can we do things better and then the

4284
01:12:32,149 --> 01:12:32,159
can we do things better and then the
 

4285
01:12:32,159 --> 01:12:34,470
can we do things better and then the
ideas are the things we're playing with

4286
01:12:34,470 --> 01:12:34,480
ideas are the things we're playing with
 

4287
01:12:34,480 --> 01:12:36,870
ideas are the things we're playing with
as opposed to people if a phd student

4288
01:12:36,870 --> 01:12:36,880
as opposed to people if a phd student
 

4289
01:12:36,880 --> 01:12:39,430
as opposed to people if a phd student
has a bad idea we don't shoot the phds

4290
01:12:39,430 --> 01:12:39,440
has a bad idea we don't shoot the phds
 

4291
01:12:39,440 --> 01:12:41,430
has a bad idea we don't shoot the phds
we just criticize their idea and i hope

4292
01:12:41,430 --> 01:12:41,440
we just criticize their idea and i hope
 

4293
01:12:41,440 --> 01:12:43,270
we just criticize their idea and i hope
they improve you have a very humane lab

4294
01:12:43,270 --> 01:12:43,280
they improve you have a very humane lab
 

4295
01:12:43,280 --> 01:12:45,270
they improve you have a very humane lab
yeah yeah i don't know how you guys do

4296
01:12:45,270 --> 01:12:45,280
yeah yeah i don't know how you guys do
 

4297
01:12:45,280 --> 01:12:46,390
yeah yeah i don't know how you guys do
it you know

4298
01:12:46,390 --> 01:12:46,400
it you know
 

4299
01:12:46,400 --> 01:12:48,790
it you know
the way i run things uh it's always life

4300
01:12:48,790 --> 01:12:48,800
the way i run things uh it's always life
 

4301
01:12:48,800 --> 01:12:51,590
the way i run things uh it's always life
and death okay so it is interesting

4302
01:12:51,590 --> 01:12:51,600
and death okay so it is interesting
 

4303
01:12:51,600 --> 01:12:53,350
and death okay so it is interesting
about humans that there is an inner

4304
01:12:53,350 --> 01:12:53,360
about humans that there is an inner
 

4305
01:12:53,360 --> 01:12:55,510
about humans that there is an inner
sense of morality

4306
01:12:55,510 --> 01:12:55,520
sense of morality
 

4307
01:12:55,520 --> 01:12:59,270
sense of morality
which begs the question of

4308
01:12:59,270 --> 01:12:59,280
which begs the question of
 

4309
01:12:59,280 --> 01:13:01,830
which begs the question of
how did homo sapiens

4310
01:13:01,830 --> 01:13:01,840
how did homo sapiens
 

4311
01:13:01,840 --> 01:13:03,750
how did homo sapiens
evolve if we think about the invention

4312
01:13:03,750 --> 01:13:03,760
evolve if we think about the invention
 

4313
01:13:03,760 --> 01:13:05,430
evolve if we think about the invention
of

4314
01:13:05,430 --> 01:13:05,440

beautiful work i think on on this kind
 

4403
01:14:32,880 --> 01:14:34,470

i don't know what the actual factors

01:15:48,159 --> 01:15:51,030
with population density and number of
interactions between different groups

4480
01:15:51,030 --> 01:15:51,040
interactions between different groups
 

4481
01:15:51,040 --> 01:15:52,870
interactions between different groups
all of which is really

4482
01:15:52,870 --> 01:15:52,880
all of which is really
 

4483
01:15:52,880 --> 01:15:54,790
all of which is really
about

4484
01:15:54,790 --> 01:15:54,800
about
 

4485
01:15:54,800 --> 01:15:56,310
about
human interactions human human

4486
01:15:56,310 --> 01:15:56,320
human interactions human human
 

4487
01:15:56,320 --> 01:15:58,470
human interactions human human
interactions and the complexity of those

4488
01:15:58,470 --> 01:15:58,480
interactions and the complexity of those
 

4489
01:15:58,480 --> 01:15:59,669
interactions and the complexity of those
but

4490
01:15:59,669 --> 01:15:59,679
but
 

4491
01:15:59,679 --> 01:16:02,070
but
population density is the thing that

4492
01:16:02,070 --> 01:16:02,080
population density is the thing that
 

4493
01:16:02,080 --> 01:16:04,229
population density is the thing that
increases the number of interactions but

4494
01:16:04,229 --> 01:16:04,239
increases the number of interactions but
 

4495
01:16:04,239 --> 01:16:08,709
increases the number of interactions but
then there must have been inventions

4496
01:16:08,709 --> 01:16:08,719

 

4497
01:16:08,719 --> 01:16:11,669

uh forced by that

4498
01:16:11,669 --> 01:16:11,679
uh forced by that
 

4499
01:16:11,679 --> 01:16:13,510
uh forced by that
number of interactions that actually led

4500
01:16:13,510 --> 01:16:13,520
number of interactions that actually led
 

4501
01:16:13,520 --> 01:16:16,390
number of interactions that actually led
to humans so like richard wrangham

4502
01:16:16,390 --> 01:16:16,400
to humans so like richard wrangham
 

4503
01:16:16,400 --> 01:16:18,470
to humans so like richard wrangham
talks about that

4504
01:16:18,470 --> 01:16:18,480
talks about that
 

4505
01:16:18,480 --> 01:16:20,470
talks about that
it's basically the beta males had to

4506
01:16:20,470 --> 01:16:20,480
it's basically the beta males had to
 

4507
01:16:20,480 --> 01:16:22,390
it's basically the beta males had to
beat up the alpha male so that's what

4508
01:16:22,390 --> 01:16:22,400
beat up the alpha male so that's what
 

4509
01:16:22,400 --> 01:16:24,630
beat up the alpha male so that's what
collaboration looks like is they when

4510
01:16:24,630 --> 01:16:24,640
collaboration looks like is they when
 

4511
01:16:24,640 --> 01:16:26,229
collaboration looks like is they when
you're living together they don't like

4512
01:16:26,229 --> 01:16:26,239
you're living together they don't like
 

4513
01:16:26,239 --> 01:16:27,189
you're living together they don't like
this

4514
01:16:27,189 --> 01:16:27,199
this
 

4515
01:16:27,199 --> 01:16:28,310
this
the

4516
01:16:28,310 --> 01:16:28,320
the
 

4517
01:16:28,320 --> 01:16:31,030
the
our early ancestors

4518
01:16:31,030 --> 01:16:31,040
our early ancestors
 

4519
01:16:31,040 --> 01:16:33,669
our early ancestors
don't like the dictatorial aspect of a

4520
01:16:33,669 --> 01:16:33,679
don't like the dictatorial aspect of a
 

4521
01:16:33,679 --> 01:16:35,910
don't like the dictatorial aspect of a
single individual at the top of a tribe

4522
01:16:35,910 --> 01:16:35,920
single individual at the top of a tribe
 

4523
01:16:35,920 --> 01:16:37,830
single individual at the top of a tribe
so they uh they they learn to

4524
01:16:37,830 --> 01:16:37,840
so they uh they they learn to
 

4525
01:16:37,840 --> 01:16:39,430
so they uh they they learn to
collaborate how to

4526
01:16:39,430 --> 01:16:39,440
collaborate how to
 

4527
01:16:39,440 --> 01:16:42,149
collaborate how to
uh basically create a democracy uh of

4528
01:16:42,149 --> 01:16:42,159
uh basically create a democracy uh of
 

4529
01:16:42,159 --> 01:16:44,310
uh basically create a democracy uh of
sorts a democracy that prevents

4530
01:16:44,310 --> 01:16:44,320
sorts a democracy that prevents
 

4531
01:16:44,320 --> 01:16:46,229
sorts a democracy that prevents
minimizes or lessens the amount of

4532
01:16:46,229 --> 01:16:46,239
minimizes or lessens the amount of
 

4533
01:16:46,239 --> 01:16:48,870
minimizes or lessens the amount of
violence which essentially

4534
01:16:48,870 --> 01:16:48,880
violence which essentially
 

4535
01:16:48,880 --> 01:16:51,189
violence which essentially
gives strength to the tribe and make the

4536
01:16:51,189 --> 01:16:51,199
gives strength to the tribe and make the
 

4537
01:16:51,199 --> 01:16:51,990
gives strength to the tribe and make the
war

4538
01:16:51,990 --> 01:16:52,000
war
 

4539
01:16:52,000 --> 01:16:53,510
war
between tribes

4540
01:16:53,510 --> 01:16:53,520
between tribes
 

4541
01:16:53,520 --> 01:16:55,350
between tribes
uh versus the dictator i mean i think

4542
01:16:55,350 --> 01:16:55,360
uh versus the dictator i mean i think
 

4543
01:16:55,360 --> 01:16:57,110
uh versus the dictator i mean i think
one of the what most wonderful things

4544
01:16:57,110 --> 01:16:57,120
one of the what most wonderful things
 

4545
01:16:57,120 --> 01:16:59,430
one of the what most wonderful things
about humans is we're all of those

4546
01:16:59,430 --> 01:16:59,440
about humans is we're all of those
 

4547
01:16:59,440 --> 01:17:02,470
about humans is we're all of those
things i mean we are deeply social as a

4548
01:17:02,470 --> 01:17:02,480
things i mean we are deeply social as a
 

4549
01:17:02,480 --> 01:17:05,189
things i mean we are deeply social as a
species and we're also deeply selfish

4550
01:17:05,189 --> 01:17:05,199
species and we're also deeply selfish
 

4551
01:17:05,199 --> 01:17:06,550
species and we're also deeply selfish
and it seems to me the conflict between

4552
01:17:06,550 --> 01:17:06,560
and it seems to me the conflict between
 

4553
01:17:06,560 --> 01:17:08,790
and it seems to me the conflict between
capitalism and communism it's really

4554
01:17:08,790 --> 01:17:08,800
capitalism and communism it's really
 

4555
01:17:08,800 --> 01:17:10,630
capitalism and communism it's really
just two aspects of human nature both of

4556
01:17:10,630 --> 01:17:10,640
just two aspects of human nature both of
 

4557
01:17:10,640 --> 01:17:13,350
just two aspects of human nature both of
which are both we have both uh and we

4558
01:17:13,350 --> 01:17:13,360
which are both we have both uh and we
 

4559
01:17:13,360 --> 01:17:15,350
which are both we have both uh and we
have a constant kind of vying between

4560
01:17:15,350 --> 01:17:15,360
have a constant kind of vying between
 

4561
01:17:15,360 --> 01:17:17,750
have a constant kind of vying between
the two sides we really do care about

4562
01:17:17,750 --> 01:17:17,760
the two sides we really do care about
 

4563
01:17:17,760 --> 01:17:19,669
the two sides we really do care about
other people beyond our families beyond

4564
01:17:19,669 --> 01:17:19,679
other people beyond our families beyond
 

4565
01:17:19,679 --> 01:17:21,830
other people beyond our families beyond
our immediate people we care about

4566
01:17:21,830 --> 01:17:21,840
our immediate people we care about
 

4567
01:17:21,840 --> 01:17:24,390
our immediate people we care about
society and the society that we live in

4568
01:17:24,390 --> 01:17:24,400
society and the society that we live in
 

4569
01:17:24,400 --> 01:17:26,470
society and the society that we live in
and and you could say that's a you know

4570
01:17:26,470 --> 01:17:26,480
and and you could say that's a you know
 

4571
01:17:26,480 --> 01:17:28,470
and and you could say that's a you know
a drawing towards socialism or communism

4572
01:17:28,470 --> 01:17:28,480
a drawing towards socialism or communism
 

4573
01:17:28,480 --> 01:17:29,910
a drawing towards socialism or communism
on the other side we really do care

4574
01:17:29,910 --> 01:17:29,920
on the other side we really do care
 

4575
01:17:29,920 --> 01:17:31,510
on the other side we really do care
about ourselves we really do care about

4576
01:17:31,510 --> 01:17:31,520
about ourselves we really do care about
 

4577
01:17:31,520 --> 01:17:33,189
about ourselves we really do care about
our families about working for something

4578
01:17:33,189 --> 01:17:33,199
our families about working for something
 

4579
01:17:33,199 --> 01:17:35,030
our families about working for something
that we gain from and that's the

4580
01:17:35,030 --> 01:17:35,040
that we gain from and that's the
 

4581
01:17:35,040 --> 01:17:36,229
that we gain from and that's the
capitalist side of it they're both

4582
01:17:36,229 --> 01:17:36,239
capitalist side of it they're both
 

4583
01:17:36,239 --> 01:17:38,709
capitalist side of it they're both
really deeply ingrained in human nature

4584
01:17:38,709 --> 01:17:38,719
really deeply ingrained in human nature
 

4585
01:17:38,719 --> 01:17:41,430
really deeply ingrained in human nature
in terms of violence um and

4586
01:17:41,430 --> 01:17:41,440
in terms of violence um and
 

4587
01:17:41,440 --> 01:17:43,750
in terms of violence um and
and interactions between groups yes all

4588
01:17:43,750 --> 01:17:43,760
and interactions between groups yes all
 

4589
01:17:43,760 --> 01:17:46,470
and interactions between groups yes all
this dynamic of if you're interacting

4590
01:17:46,470 --> 01:17:46,480
this dynamic of if you're interacting
 

4591
01:17:46,480 --> 01:17:48,790
this dynamic of if you're interacting
between groups you can be certain that

4592
01:17:48,790 --> 01:17:48,800
between groups you can be certain that
 

4593
01:17:48,800 --> 01:17:50,149
between groups you can be certain that
they're going to be burning each other

4594
01:17:50,149 --> 01:17:50,159
they're going to be burning each other
 

4595
01:17:50,159 --> 01:17:51,910
they're going to be burning each other
and all kinds of interact physical

4596
01:17:51,910 --> 01:17:51,920
and all kinds of interact physical
 

4597
01:17:51,920 --> 01:17:53,669
and all kinds of interact physical
violent interactions as well which will

4598
01:17:53,669 --> 01:17:53,679
violent interactions as well which will
 

4599
01:17:53,679 --> 01:17:55,110
violent interactions as well which will
drive

4600
01:17:55,110 --> 01:17:55,120
drive
 

4601
01:17:55,120 --> 01:17:57,110
drive
the kind of cleverness of how do you

4602
01:17:57,110 --> 01:17:57,120
the kind of cleverness of how do you
 

4603
01:17:57,120 --> 01:17:59,030
the kind of cleverness of how do you
resist this let's build a tower let's

4604
01:17:59,030 --> 01:17:59,040
resist this let's build a tower let's
 

4605
01:17:59,040 --> 01:18:00,870
resist this let's build a tower let's
you know what are we going to do to to

4606
01:18:00,870 --> 01:18:00,880
you know what are we going to do to to
 

4607
01:18:00,880 --> 01:18:02,950
you know what are we going to do to to
to to prevent being overrun by those

4608
01:18:02,950 --> 01:18:02,960
to to prevent being overrun by those
 

4609
01:18:02,960 --> 01:18:05,430
to to prevent being overrun by those
marauding gangs from over there

4610
01:18:05,430 --> 01:18:05,440
marauding gangs from over there
 

4611
01:18:05,440 --> 01:18:08,149
marauding gangs from over there
um and you look you look outside humans

4612
01:18:08,149 --> 01:18:08,159
um and you look you look outside humans
 

4613
01:18:08,159 --> 01:18:10,070
um and you look you look outside humans
and you look at chimps and bonnibos and

4614
01:18:10,070 --> 01:18:10,080
and you look at chimps and bonnibos and
 

4615
01:18:10,080 --> 01:18:11,910
and you look at chimps and bonnibos and
so on and they're very very different

4616
01:18:11,910 --> 01:18:11,920
so on and they're very very different
 

4617
01:18:11,920 --> 01:18:14,229
so on and they're very very different
structures to society chimps tend to

4618
01:18:14,229 --> 01:18:14,239
structures to society chimps tend to
 

4619
01:18:14,239 --> 01:18:16,070
structures to society chimps tend to
have an aggressive alpha male type

4620
01:18:16,070 --> 01:18:16,080
have an aggressive alpha male type
 

4621
01:18:16,080 --> 01:18:19,030
have an aggressive alpha male type
structure and bonobos are you know they

4622
01:18:19,030 --> 01:18:19,040
structure and bonobos are you know they
 

4623
01:18:19,040 --> 01:18:20,870
structure and bonobos are you know they
they there's basically a female society

4624
01:18:20,870 --> 01:18:20,880
they there's basically a female society
 

4625
01:18:20,880 --> 01:18:22,229
they there's basically a female society
where the males are predominantly

4626
01:18:22,229 --> 01:18:22,239
where the males are predominantly
 

4627
01:18:22,239 --> 01:18:23,590
where the males are predominantly
excluded and only brought in at the

4628
01:18:23,590 --> 01:18:23,600
excluded and only brought in at the
 

4629
01:18:23,600 --> 01:18:25,510
excluded and only brought in at the
behest of the female

4630
01:18:25,510 --> 01:18:25,520
behest of the female
 

4631
01:18:25,520 --> 01:18:27,990
behest of the female
we have a lot in common with both

4632
01:18:27,990 --> 01:18:28,000
we have a lot in common with both
 

4633
01:18:28,000 --> 01:18:29,910
we have a lot in common with both
both of those groups and there's again

4634
01:18:29,910 --> 01:18:29,920
both of those groups and there's again
 

4635
01:18:29,920 --> 01:18:32,229
both of those groups and there's again
tension there yeah and uh probably

4636
01:18:32,229 --> 01:18:32,239
tension there yeah and uh probably
 

4637
01:18:32,239 --> 01:18:33,830
tension there yeah and uh probably
chimps more violence with bonobos

4638
01:18:33,830 --> 01:18:33,840
chimps more violence with bonobos
 

4639
01:18:33,840 --> 01:18:35,430
chimps more violence with bonobos
probably more sex

4640
01:18:35,430 --> 01:18:35,440
probably more sex
 

4641
01:18:35,440 --> 01:18:36,590
probably more sex
that's another tension

4642
01:18:36,590 --> 01:18:36,600
that's another tension
 

4643
01:18:36,600 --> 01:18:39,669
that's another tension
[Laughter]

4644
01:18:39,669 --> 01:18:39,679
[Laughter]
 

4645
01:18:39,679 --> 01:18:42,310
[Laughter]
how serious do i do do we want to be how

4646
01:18:42,310 --> 01:18:42,320
how serious do i do do we want to be how
 

4647
01:18:42,320 --> 01:18:44,709
how serious do i do do we want to be how
much fun we want to be uh asking for a

4648
01:18:44,709 --> 01:18:44,719
much fun we want to be uh asking for a
 

4649
01:18:44,719 --> 01:18:45,910
much fun we want to be uh asking for a
friend again

4650
01:18:45,910 --> 01:18:45,920
friend again
 

4651
01:18:45,920 --> 01:18:46,870
friend again
what do you think happened to

4652
01:18:46,870 --> 01:18:46,880
what do you think happened to
 

4653
01:18:46,880 --> 01:18:49,510
what do you think happened to
neanderthals what did we

4654
01:18:49,510 --> 01:18:49,520
neanderthals what did we
 

4655
01:18:49,520 --> 01:18:51,830
neanderthals what did we
cheeky humans do to the neanderthals

4656
01:18:51,830 --> 01:18:51,840
cheeky humans do to the neanderthals
 

4657
01:18:51,840 --> 01:18:53,830
cheeky humans do to the neanderthals
homo sapiens do you think we murdered

4658
01:18:53,830 --> 01:18:53,840
homo sapiens do you think we murdered
 

4659
01:18:53,840 --> 01:18:55,270
homo sapiens do you think we murdered
them was it

4660
01:18:55,270 --> 01:18:55,280
them was it
 

4661
01:18:55,280 --> 01:18:57,110
them was it
that how do we murder them how do we

4662
01:18:57,110 --> 01:18:57,120
that how do we murder them how do we
 

4663
01:18:57,120 --> 01:18:58,709
that how do we murder them how do we
out-compete them

4664
01:18:58,709 --> 01:18:58,719
out-compete them
 

4665
01:18:58,719 --> 01:18:59,830
out-compete them
um

4666
01:18:59,830 --> 01:18:59,840
um
 

4667
01:18:59,840 --> 01:19:02,470
um
do we i made them i don't know i mean i

4668
01:19:02,470 --> 01:19:02,480
do we i made them i don't know i mean i
 

4669
01:19:02,480 --> 01:19:04,310
do we i made them i don't know i mean i
i think there's unequivocal evidence

4670
01:19:04,310 --> 01:19:04,320
i think there's unequivocal evidence
 

4671
01:19:04,320 --> 01:19:06,470
i think there's unequivocal evidence
that we mated with them yeah we always

4672
01:19:06,470 --> 01:19:06,480
that we mated with them yeah we always
 

4673
01:19:06,480 --> 01:19:08,229
that we mated with them yeah we always
try to meet with everything yes pretty

4674
01:19:08,229 --> 01:19:08,239
try to meet with everything yes pretty
 

4675
01:19:08,239 --> 01:19:09,270
try to meet with everything yes pretty
much

4676
01:19:09,270 --> 01:19:09,280
much
 

4677
01:19:09,280 --> 01:19:10,709
much
there's some interesting the first

4678
01:19:10,709 --> 01:19:10,719
there's some interesting the first
 

4679
01:19:10,719 --> 01:19:12,149
there's some interesting the first
sequences that came along were in

4680
01:19:12,149 --> 01:19:12,159
sequences that came along were in
 

4681
01:19:12,159 --> 01:19:14,229
sequences that came along were in
mitochondrial dna

4682
01:19:14,229 --> 01:19:14,239
mitochondrial dna
 

4683
01:19:14,239 --> 01:19:16,390
mitochondrial dna
and that was back to about 2002 or

4684
01:19:16,390 --> 01:19:16,400
and that was back to about 2002 or
 

4685
01:19:16,400 --> 01:19:18,390
and that was back to about 2002 or
thereabouts

4686
01:19:18,390 --> 01:19:18,400
thereabouts
 

4687
01:19:18,400 --> 01:19:20,070
thereabouts
what was found was that neanderthal

4688
01:19:20,070 --> 01:19:20,080
what was found was that neanderthal
 

4689
01:19:20,080 --> 01:19:22,229
what was found was that neanderthal
mitochondrial dna was very different to

4690
01:19:22,229 --> 01:19:22,239
mitochondrial dna was very different to
 

4691
01:19:22,239 --> 01:19:23,830
mitochondrial dna was very different to
human mitochondria that's so interesting

4692
01:19:23,830 --> 01:19:23,840
human mitochondria that's so interesting
 

4693
01:19:23,840 --> 01:19:25,430
human mitochondria that's so interesting
you could do a clock on it and it said

4694
01:19:25,430 --> 01:19:25,440
you could do a clock on it and it said
 

4695
01:19:25,440 --> 01:19:27,830
you could do a clock on it and it said
the divergent state was about 600 000

4696
01:19:27,830 --> 01:19:27,840
the divergent state was about 600 000
 

4697
01:19:27,840 --> 01:19:29,430
the divergent state was about 600 000
years ago or something like that so not

4698
01:19:29,430 --> 01:19:29,440
years ago or something like that so not
 

4699
01:19:29,440 --> 01:19:30,870
years ago or something like that so not
so long ago

4700
01:19:30,870 --> 01:19:30,880
so long ago
 

4701
01:19:30,880 --> 01:19:33,350
so long ago
um and then the first full genomes were

4702
01:19:33,350 --> 01:19:33,360
um and then the first full genomes were
 

4703
01:19:33,360 --> 01:19:36,070
um and then the first full genomes were
secrets maybe 10 years after that

4704
01:19:36,070 --> 01:19:36,080
secrets maybe 10 years after that
 

4705
01:19:36,080 --> 01:19:38,630
secrets maybe 10 years after that
and they showed plenty of signs of

4706
01:19:38,630 --> 01:19:38,640
and they showed plenty of signs of
 

4707
01:19:38,640 --> 01:19:40,709
and they showed plenty of signs of
mating between so so the mitochondrial

4708
01:19:40,709 --> 01:19:40,719
mating between so so the mitochondrial
 

4709
01:19:40,719 --> 01:19:42,950
mating between so so the mitochondrial
dna effectively says no mating

4710
01:19:42,950 --> 01:19:42,960
dna effectively says no mating
 

4711
01:19:42,960 --> 01:19:44,790
dna effectively says no mating
and the the nuclear

4712
01:19:44,790 --> 01:19:44,800
and the the nuclear
 

4713
01:19:44,800 --> 01:19:47,350
and the the nuclear
genes say yeah lots of mating

4714
01:19:47,350 --> 01:19:47,360
genes say yeah lots of mating
 

4715
01:19:47,360 --> 01:19:49,270
genes say yeah lots of mating
um but we don't know is that possible so

4716
01:19:49,270 --> 01:19:49,280
um but we don't know is that possible so
 

4717
01:19:49,280 --> 01:19:50,470
um but we don't know is that possible so
can you explain the difference between

4718
01:19:50,470 --> 01:19:50,480
can you explain the difference between
 

4719
01:19:50,480 --> 01:19:52,950
can you explain the difference between
mitochondrial cell yes and new uh

4720
01:19:52,950 --> 01:19:52,960
mitochondrial cell yes and new uh
 

4721
01:19:52,960 --> 01:19:54,790
mitochondrial cell yes and new uh
nucleus i've talked before about the

4722
01:19:54,790 --> 01:19:54,800
nucleus i've talked before about the
 

4723
01:19:54,800 --> 01:19:56,630
nucleus i've talked before about the
mitochondria which are the power packs

4724
01:19:56,630 --> 01:19:56,640
mitochondria which are the power packs
 

4725
01:19:56,640 --> 01:19:58,550
mitochondria which are the power packs
in cells these are the paired down

4726
01:19:58,550 --> 01:19:58,560
in cells these are the paired down
 

4727
01:19:58,560 --> 01:20:01,270
in cells these are the paired down
control units is that is their dna

4728
01:20:01,270 --> 01:20:01,280
control units is that is their dna
 

4729
01:20:01,280 --> 01:20:01,990
control units is that is their dna
so

4730
01:20:01,990 --> 01:20:02,000
so
 

4731
01:20:02,000 --> 01:20:04,870
so
it's passed on by the mother only

4732
01:20:04,870 --> 01:20:04,880
it's passed on by the mother only
 

4733
01:20:04,880 --> 01:20:05,830
it's passed on by the mother only
and

4734
01:20:05,830 --> 01:20:05,840
and
 

4735
01:20:05,840 --> 01:20:08,070
and
in the egg cell we might have half a

4736
01:20:08,070 --> 01:20:08,080
in the egg cell we might have half a
 

4737
01:20:08,080 --> 01:20:10,390
in the egg cell we might have half a
million copies of mitochondrial dna

4738
01:20:10,390 --> 01:20:10,400
million copies of mitochondrial dna
 

4739
01:20:10,400 --> 01:20:13,270
million copies of mitochondrial dna
there's only 37 genes left

4740
01:20:13,270 --> 01:20:13,280
there's only 37 genes left
 

4741
01:20:13,280 --> 01:20:14,870
there's only 37 genes left
and and they do a

4742
01:20:14,870 --> 01:20:14,880
and and they do a
 

4743
01:20:14,880 --> 01:20:16,390
and and they do a
it's basically the control unit of

4744
01:20:16,390 --> 01:20:16,400
it's basically the control unit of
 

4745
01:20:16,400 --> 01:20:17,750
it's basically the control unit of
energy production that's what is that's

4746
01:20:17,750 --> 01:20:17,760
energy production that's what is that's
 

4747
01:20:17,760 --> 01:20:19,750
energy production that's what is that's
what it's doing it's a basic old-school

4748
01:20:19,750 --> 01:20:19,760
what it's doing it's a basic old-school
 

4749
01:20:19,760 --> 01:20:22,390
what it's doing it's a basic old-school
machine that does and it's got genes

4750
01:20:22,390 --> 01:20:22,400
machine that does and it's got genes
 

4751
01:20:22,400 --> 01:20:24,390
machine that does and it's got genes
that were considered to be effectively

4752
01:20:24,390 --> 01:20:24,400
that were considered to be effectively
 

4753
01:20:24,400 --> 01:20:26,790
that were considered to be effectively
trivial because they did they did a a

4754
01:20:26,790 --> 01:20:26,800
trivial because they did they did a a
 

4755
01:20:26,800 --> 01:20:28,950
trivial because they did they did a a
very narrowly defined job but they're

4756
01:20:28,950 --> 01:20:28,960
very narrowly defined job but they're
 

4757
01:20:28,960 --> 01:20:30,550
very narrowly defined job but they're
not trivial in the sense that that

4758
01:20:30,550 --> 01:20:30,560
not trivial in the sense that that
 

4759
01:20:30,560 --> 01:20:32,550
not trivial in the sense that that
narrowly defined job is about

4760
01:20:32,550 --> 01:20:32,560
narrowly defined job is about
 

4761
01:20:32,560 --> 01:20:36,790
narrowly defined job is about
everything is being alive yeah um so

4762
01:20:36,790 --> 01:20:36,800
everything is being alive yeah um so
 

4763
01:20:36,800 --> 01:20:37,990
everything is being alive yeah um so
so they're much easier to sequence

4764
01:20:37,990 --> 01:20:38,000
so they're much easier to sequence
 

4765
01:20:38,000 --> 01:20:39,350
so they're much easier to sequence
you've got many more copies of these

4766
01:20:39,350 --> 01:20:39,360
you've got many more copies of these
 

4767
01:20:39,360 --> 01:20:40,629
you've got many more copies of these
things and you can sequence them very

4768
01:20:40,629 --> 01:20:40,639
things and you can sequence them very
 

4769
01:20:40,639 --> 01:20:41,590
things and you can sequence them very
quickly

4770
01:20:41,590 --> 01:20:41,600
quickly
 

4771
01:20:41,600 --> 01:20:43,430
quickly
um but the problem is because they go

4772
01:20:43,430 --> 01:20:43,440
um but the problem is because they go
 

4773
01:20:43,440 --> 01:20:45,270
um but the problem is because they go
down only the maternal line from mother

4774
01:20:45,270 --> 01:20:45,280
down only the maternal line from mother
 

4775
01:20:45,280 --> 01:20:47,590
down only the maternal line from mother
to daughter your mitochondrial dna and

4776
01:20:47,590 --> 01:20:47,600
to daughter your mitochondrial dna and
 

4777
01:20:47,600 --> 01:20:51,110
to daughter your mitochondrial dna and
mine is going nowhere doesn't matter any

4778
01:20:51,110 --> 01:20:51,120
mine is going nowhere doesn't matter any
 

4779
01:20:51,120 --> 01:20:52,470
mine is going nowhere doesn't matter any
kids we have they get their mother's

4780
01:20:52,470 --> 01:20:52,480
kids we have they get their mother's
 

4781
01:20:52,480 --> 01:20:54,149
kids we have they get their mother's
mitochondrial dna

4782
01:20:54,149 --> 01:20:54,159
mitochondrial dna
 

4783
01:20:54,159 --> 01:20:57,910
mitochondrial dna
um except in very very rare and strange

4784
01:20:57,910 --> 01:20:57,920
um except in very very rare and strange
 

4785
01:20:57,920 --> 01:20:59,430
um except in very very rare and strange
circumstances

4786
01:20:59,430 --> 01:20:59,440
circumstances
 

4787
01:20:59,440 --> 01:21:02,310
circumstances
um and so it tells a different story and

4788
01:21:02,310 --> 01:21:02,320
um and so it tells a different story and
 

4789
01:21:02,320 --> 01:21:04,390
um and so it tells a different story and
it's not a story which is easy to

4790
01:21:04,390 --> 01:21:04,400
it's not a story which is easy to
 

4791
01:21:04,400 --> 01:21:06,229
it's not a story which is easy to
reconcile always

4792
01:21:06,229 --> 01:21:06,239
reconcile always
 

4793
01:21:06,239 --> 01:21:09,030
reconcile always
um and and what it seems to suggest to

4794
01:21:09,030 --> 01:21:09,040
um and and what it seems to suggest to
 

4795
01:21:09,040 --> 01:21:11,030
um and and what it seems to suggest to
my mind at least is that there was one

4796
01:21:11,030 --> 01:21:11,040
my mind at least is that there was one
 

4797
01:21:11,040 --> 01:21:11,910
my mind at least is that there was one
way

4798
01:21:11,910 --> 01:21:11,920
way
 

4799
01:21:11,920 --> 01:21:15,270
way

yes

4858
01:22:11,990 --> 01:22:12,000
yes
 

4859
01:22:12,000 --> 01:22:13,669
yes
and in some respects maybe it's best if

4860
01:22:13,669 --> 01:22:13,679
and in some respects maybe it's best if
 

4861
01:22:13,679 --> 01:22:15,110
and in some respects maybe it's best if
we don't know

we don't know
 

4863
01:22:15,120 --> 01:22:18,229
we don't know
yeah the truth might be very painful

4864
01:22:18,229 --> 01:22:18,239
yeah the truth might be very painful
 

4865
01:22:18,239 --> 01:22:20,550
yeah the truth might be very painful
what about if we actually step back

4866
01:22:20,550 --> 01:22:20,560
what about if we actually step back

01:22:20,560 --> 01:22:21,990
what about if we actually step back
a couple of interesting things that we

01:22:21,990 --> 01:22:22,000
a couple of interesting things that we
 

4869
01:22:22,000 --> 01:22:24,790
a couple of interesting things that we
humans do

4870
01:22:24,790 --> 01:22:24,800
humans do
 

4871
01:22:24,800 --> 01:22:27,350
humans do
one is object manipulation and

4872
01:22:27,350 --> 01:22:27,360
one is object manipulation and
 

4873
01:22:27,360 --> 01:22:28,709
one is object manipulation and
movement

4874
01:22:28,709 --> 01:22:28,719
movement
 

4875
01:22:28,719 --> 01:22:30,390
movement
and of course movement was something

4876
01:22:30,390 --> 01:22:30,400
and of course movement was something
 

4877
01:22:30,400 --> 01:22:31,910
and of course movement was something
that was done

4878
01:22:31,910 --> 01:22:31,920
that was done
 

4879
01:22:31,920 --> 01:22:33,830
that was done

01:22:37,669 --> 01:22:37,679
and the other one is
 

4885
01:22:37,679 --> 01:22:39,990
and the other one is

01:23:29,590 --> 01:23:29,600
change for each generation how long
 

4935
01:23:29,600 --> 01:23:31,110
change for each generation how long
would it take to evolve and high as we

4936
01:23:31,110 --> 01:23:31,120
would it take to evolve and high as we
 

4937
01:23:31,120 --> 01:23:32,550
would it take to evolve and high as we
know it and the answer is half a million

4938
01:23:32,550 --> 01:23:32,560
know it and the answer is half a million
 

4939
01:23:32,560 --> 01:23:33,430
know it and the answer is half a million
years

4940
01:23:33,430 --> 01:23:33,440
years
 

4941
01:23:33,440 --> 01:23:35,669
years
um it doesn't have to take long that's

4942
01:23:35,669 --> 01:23:35,679
um it doesn't have to take long that's
 

4943
01:23:35,679 --> 01:23:37,189
um it doesn't have to take long that's
not how evolution works that's not a

4944
01:23:37,189 --> 01:23:37,199
not how evolution works that's not a
 

4945
01:23:37,199 --> 01:23:38,709
not how evolution works that's not a
that's not an answer to the question it

4946
01:23:38,709 --> 01:23:38,719
that's not an answer to the question it
 

4947
01:23:38,719 --> 01:23:41,590
that's not an answer to the question it
just shows you can reconstruct the steps

4948
01:23:41,590 --> 01:23:41,600
just shows you can reconstruct the steps
 

4949
01:23:41,600 --> 01:23:43,669
just shows you can reconstruct the steps
and you can work out roughly how it can

4950
01:23:43,669 --> 01:23:43,679
and you can work out roughly how it can
 

4951
01:23:43,679 --> 01:23:44,470
and you can work out roughly how it can
work

4952
01:23:44,470 --> 01:23:44,480
work
 

4953
01:23:44,480 --> 01:23:47,669
work
so it's not that big a deal to evolve an

4954
01:23:47,669 --> 01:23:47,679
so it's not that big a deal to evolve an
 

4955
01:23:47,679 --> 01:23:49,189
so it's not that big a deal to evolve an
eye

4956
01:23:49,189 --> 01:23:49,199
eye
 

4957
01:23:49,199 --> 01:23:51,030
eye
but once you have one then there's

4958
01:23:51,030 --> 01:23:51,040
but once you have one then there's
 

4959
01:23:51,040 --> 01:23:53,669
but once you have one then there's
nowhere to hide and again we're back to

4960
01:23:53,669 --> 01:23:53,679
nowhere to hide and again we're back to
 

4961
01:23:53,679 --> 01:23:55,350
nowhere to hide and again we're back to
predator prey relationships where back

4962

philosophically what bats are doing with

4968
01:24:01,030 --> 01:24:01,040
philosophically what bats are doing with
 

4969
01:24:01,040 --> 01:24:03,350
philosophically what bats are doing with
ecolocation and so on

4970
01:24:03,350 --> 01:24:03,360
ecolocation and so on
 

4971
01:24:03,360 --> 01:24:05,030
ecolocation and so on
i have no idea but i suspect that they

4972
01:24:05,030 --> 01:24:05,040
i have no idea but i suspect that they
 

4973
01:24:05,040 --> 01:24:06,709
i have no idea but i suspect that they
form an image of the world in pretty

4974
01:24:06,709 --> 01:24:06,719
form an image of the world in pretty
 

4975
01:24:06,719 --> 01:24:08,310
form an image of the world in pretty
much the same way that we do it's just a

4976
01:24:08,310 --> 01:24:08,320
much the same way that we do it's just a
 

4977
01:24:08,320 --> 01:24:10,229
much the same way that we do it's just a
matter of mental reconstruction so i

4978
01:24:10,229 --> 01:24:10,239
matter of mental reconstruction so i
 

4979
01:24:10,239 --> 01:24:11,750
matter of mental reconstruction so i
suppose the other thing about sight

4980
01:24:11,750 --> 01:24:11,760
suppose the other thing about sight
 

4981
01:24:11,760 --> 01:24:14,390
suppose the other thing about sight
there are single celled

4982
01:24:14,390 --> 01:24:14,400
there are single celled
 

4983
01:24:14,400 --> 01:24:17,270
there are single celled
organisms that have got a lens

4984
01:24:17,270 --> 01:24:17,280
organisms that have got a lens
 

4985
01:24:17,280 --> 01:24:21,350
organisms that have got a lens
and a a retina and a and a cornea and so

4986
01:24:21,350 --> 01:24:21,360
and a a retina and a and a cornea and so
 

4987
01:24:21,360 --> 01:24:22,870
and a a retina and a and a cornea and so
on basically they've got a camera type

4988
01:24:22,870 --> 01:24:22,880
on basically they've got a camera type
 

4989
01:24:22,880 --> 01:24:25,270
on basically they've got a camera type
eye in a single cell they don't have a

4990
01:24:25,270 --> 01:24:25,280
eye in a single cell they don't have a

um

4994
01:24:27,350 --> 01:24:27,360
um
 

4995
01:24:27,360 --> 01:24:29,510
um
what they understand about their world

4996
01:24:29,510 --> 01:24:29,520
what they understand about their world
 

4997
01:24:29,520 --> 01:24:31,669
what they understand about their world
is impossible to say but but they're

4998
01:24:31,669 --> 01:24:31,679
is impossible to say but but they're
 

4999
01:24:31,679 --> 01:24:33,510
is impossible to say but but they're
capable of coming up with with the same

5000
01:24:33,510 --> 01:24:33,520
capable of coming up with with the same
 

5001
01:24:33,520 --> 01:24:36,550
capable of coming up with with the same
structures to do so so i suppose then

5002
01:24:36,550 --> 01:24:36,560
structures to do so so i suppose then
 

5003
01:24:36,560 --> 01:24:39,030
structures to do so so i suppose then
is that once you've got things like eyes

5004
01:24:39,030 --> 01:24:39,040
is that once you've got things like eyes
 

5005
01:24:39,040 --> 01:24:41,030
is that once you've got things like eyes
then you have a big driving pressure on

5006
01:24:41,030 --> 01:24:41,040
then you have a big driving pressure on
 

5007
01:24:41,040 --> 01:24:42,790
then you have a big driving pressure on
the central nervous system to figure out

5008
01:24:42,790 --> 01:24:42,800
the central nervous system to figure out
 

5009
01:24:42,800 --> 01:24:44,950
the central nervous system to figure out
what it all means and we come around to

5010
01:24:44,950 --> 01:24:44,960
what it all means and we come around to
 

5011
01:24:44,960 --> 01:24:46,550
what it all means and we come around to
your other point about manipulation

5012
01:24:46,550 --> 01:24:46,560
your other point about manipulation
 

5013
01:24:46,560 --> 01:24:48,709
your other point about manipulation
sensory input and so on about you now

5014
01:24:48,709 --> 01:24:48,719
sensory input and so on about you now
 

5015
01:24:48,719 --> 01:24:50,070
sensory input and so on about you now
now you

5016
01:24:50,070 --> 01:24:50,080
now you
 

5017
01:24:50,080 --> 01:24:52,790
now you
you you you have a huge requirement to

5018
01:24:52,790 --> 01:24:52,800
you you you have a huge requirement to
 

5019
01:24:52,800 --> 01:24:54,390
you you you have a huge requirement to
understand what your environment is and

5020
01:24:54,390 --> 01:24:54,400
understand what your environment is and
 

5021
01:24:54,400 --> 01:24:56,229
understand what your environment is and
what it means and how it reacts and how

5022
01:24:56,229 --> 01:24:56,239
what it means and how it reacts and how
 

5023
01:24:56,239 --> 01:24:57,430
what it means and how it reacts and how
you should run away and where you should

5024
01:24:57,430 --> 01:24:57,440
you should run away and where you should
 

5025
01:24:57,440 --> 01:24:59,030
you should run away and where you should
stay put

5026
01:24:59,030 --> 01:24:59,040
stay put
 

5027
01:24:59,040 --> 01:25:00,709
stay put
actually on that point let me i don't

5028
01:25:00,709 --> 01:25:00,719
actually on that point let me i don't
 

5029
01:25:00,719 --> 01:25:02,390
actually on that point let me i don't
know if you know the work of donald

5030
01:25:02,390 --> 01:25:02,400

um
 

5039
01:25:09,600 --> 01:25:13,030
um

we're living inside an illusion and

01:25:32,390 --> 01:25:32,400
we're living inside an illusion and
 

5059
01:25:32,400 --> 01:25:34,790
we're living inside an illusion and
we're basically the entire

we're basically the entire
 

5061
01:25:34,800 --> 01:25:37,510
we're basically the entire
uh the entire set of species on earth i

uh the entire set of species on earth i
 

5063
01:25:37,520 --> 01:25:40,070
uh the entire set of species on earth i
think i i guess are competing in a space

01:25:40,070 --> 01:25:40,080
think i i guess are competing in a space

that's an illusion that's distinct from

01:25:41,830 --> 01:25:41,840
that's an illusion that's distinct from
 

5067
01:25:41,840 --> 01:25:44,709
that's an illusion that's distinct from
this far away from physical reality as

01:25:44,709 --> 01:25:44,719
this far away from physical reality as
 

5069
01:25:44,719 --> 01:25:46,550
this far away from physical reality as
it is as defined by physics i'm not sure

5070
01:25:46,550 --> 01:25:46,560
it is as defined by physics i'm not sure
 

5071
01:25:46,560 --> 01:25:48,709
it is as defined by physics i'm not sure
it's an illusion so much as a bubble i

5072
01:25:48,709 --> 01:25:48,719
it's an illusion so much as a bubble i
 

5073
01:25:48,719 --> 01:25:50,629
it's an illusion so much as a bubble i
mean we we have a sensory input which is

5074
01:25:50,629 --> 01:25:50,639
mean we we have a sensory input which is
 

5075
01:25:50,639 --> 01:25:51,910
mean we we have a sensory input which is
a fraction of what we could have a

5076
01:25:51,910 --> 01:25:51,920
a fraction of what we could have a
 

5077
01:25:51,920 --> 01:25:55,189
a fraction of what we could have a
sensory input on um and we interpret it

5078
01:25:55,189 --> 01:25:55,199
sensory input on um and we interpret it
 

5079
01:25:55,199 --> 01:25:57,350
sensory input on um and we interpret it
in terms of what's useful for us to know

5080
01:25:57,350 --> 01:25:57,360
in terms of what's useful for us to know
 

5081
01:25:57,360 --> 01:25:59,910
in terms of what's useful for us to know
to stay alive so yes it's an illusion in

5082
01:25:59,910 --> 01:25:59,920
to stay alive so yes it's an illusion in
 

5083
01:25:59,920 --> 01:26:01,669
to stay alive so yes it's an illusion in
that sense but

5084
01:26:01,669 --> 01:26:01,679
that sense but
 

5085
01:26:01,679 --> 01:26:03,910
that sense but
the tree is physically there and if you

5086
01:26:03,910 --> 01:26:03,920
the tree is physically there and if you
 

5087
01:26:03,920 --> 01:26:06,390
the tree is physically there and if you
walk into that tree you you know that

5088
01:26:06,390 --> 01:26:06,400
walk into that tree you you know that
 

5089
01:26:06,400 --> 01:26:08,070
walk into that tree you you know that
there is it's not purely a delusion

5090
01:26:08,070 --> 01:26:08,080
there is it's not purely a delusion
 

5091
01:26:08,080 --> 01:26:10,390
there is it's not purely a delusion
there's some physical reality to it so

5092
01:26:10,390 --> 01:26:10,400
there's some physical reality to it so
 

5093
01:26:10,400 --> 01:26:12,470
there's some physical reality to it so
it's a it's a uh

5094
01:26:12,470 --> 01:26:12,480
it's a it's a uh
 

5095
01:26:12,480 --> 01:26:15,669
it's a it's a uh
sensory slice into reality as it is but

5096
01:26:15,669 --> 01:26:15,679
sensory slice into reality as it is but
 

5097
01:26:15,679 --> 01:26:17,510
sensory slice into reality as it is but
because it's just a slice you're missing

5098
01:26:17,510 --> 01:26:17,520
because it's just a slice you're missing
 

5099
01:26:17,520 --> 01:26:19,750
because it's just a slice you're missing
a big picture but he says that that

5100
01:26:19,750 --> 01:26:19,760
a big picture but he says that that
 

5101
01:26:19,760 --> 01:26:21,910
a big picture but he says that that
slice doesn't necessarily need to be a

5102
01:26:21,910 --> 01:26:21,920
slice doesn't necessarily need to be a
 

5103
01:26:21,920 --> 01:26:22,950
slice doesn't necessarily need to be a
slice

5104
01:26:22,950 --> 01:26:22,960
slice
 

5105
01:26:22,960 --> 01:26:25,750
slice
it could be a complete fabrication

5106
01:26:25,750 --> 01:26:25,760
it could be a complete fabrication
 

5107
01:26:25,760 --> 01:26:27,510
it could be a complete fabrication
that's just consistent amongst the

5108
01:26:27,510 --> 01:26:27,520
that's just consistent amongst the
 

5109
01:26:27,520 --> 01:26:29,910
that's just consistent amongst the
species which is an interesting or at

5110
01:26:29,910 --> 01:26:29,920
species which is an interesting or at
 

5111
01:26:29,920 --> 01:26:32,709
species which is an interesting or at
least it's a humbling

5112
01:26:32,709 --> 01:26:32,719
least it's a humbling
 

5113
01:26:32,719 --> 01:26:35,669
least it's a humbling
realization that our perception

5114
01:26:35,669 --> 01:26:35,679
realization that our perception
 

5115
01:26:35,679 --> 01:26:38,790
realization that our perception
is limited and our cognitive abilities

5116
01:26:38,790 --> 01:26:38,800
is limited and our cognitive abilities
 

5117
01:26:38,800 --> 01:26:40,390
is limited and our cognitive abilities
are limited

5118
01:26:40,390 --> 01:26:40,400
are limited
 

5119
01:26:40,400 --> 01:26:41,990
are limited
and

5120
01:26:41,990 --> 01:26:42,000
and
 

5121
01:26:42,000 --> 01:26:43,430
and

at least to me
it's argument from evolution i don't

it's argument from evolution i don't
 

5125
01:26:45,040 --> 01:26:45,750
it's argument from evolution i don't
know

5126
01:26:45,750 --> 01:26:45,760
know
 

5127
01:26:45,760 --> 01:26:48,229
know
how much how how strong that is as an

01:26:48,229 --> 01:26:48,239
how much how how strong that is as an

but

5132
01:26:50,390 --> 01:26:50,400
but
 

5133
01:26:50,400 --> 01:26:53,510
but
i do think that life can exist

5134
01:26:53,510 --> 01:26:53,520
i do think that life can exist
 

5135
01:26:53,520 --> 01:26:55,910
i do think that life can exist
in the mind

5136
01:26:55,910 --> 01:26:55,920
in the mind
 

5137
01:26:55,920 --> 01:26:57,750
in the mind
yes in the same way that you can do a

5138
01:26:57,750 --> 01:26:57,760
yes in the same way that you can do a
 

5139
01:26:57,760 --> 01:26:59,750
yes in the same way that you can do a
virtual reality video game and you can

5140
01:26:59,750 --> 01:26:59,760
virtual reality video game and you can
 

5141
01:26:59,760 --> 01:27:02,310
virtual reality video game and you can
have a vibrant life inside that place

5142
01:27:02,310 --> 01:27:02,320
have a vibrant life inside that place
 

5143
01:27:02,320 --> 01:27:05,669
have a vibrant life inside that place
and that place is not real in some sense

5144
01:27:05,669 --> 01:27:05,679
and that place is not real in some sense
 

5145
01:27:05,679 --> 01:27:07,430
and that place is not real in some sense
but you could still have a vibe all the

5146
01:27:07,430 --> 01:27:07,440
but you could still have a vibe all the
 

5147
01:27:07,440 --> 01:27:09,990
but you could still have a vibe all the
same forces of evolution all the same

same forces of evolution all the same

but i don't know
 

5155

i don't know if there's evidence for

i don't know if there's evidence for

01:27:21,120 --> 01:27:22,790
i don't know if there's evidence for
that being the thing that happened on

you could have exactly the world that

you could have exactly the world that
 

5167
01:27:29,199 --> 01:27:30,709
you could have exactly the world that
you talk about and it would be very

you talk about and it would be very
 

5169
01:27:30,719 --> 01:27:34,629

difficult to uh you know the the idea um

01:27:41,990 --> 01:27:42,000
a construction um
 

5177
01:27:42,000 --> 01:27:44,310
a construction um
and we're fundamentally deluded it's

it's difficult to say that's impossible

it's difficult to say that's impossible

and certainly we construct in our minds

01:27:51,030 --> 01:27:51,040
and certainly we construct in our minds
 

5185
01:27:51,040 --> 01:27:52,629
and certainly we construct in our minds
what the outside world is but we do it

01:27:52,629 --> 01:27:52,639
what the outside world is but we do it
 

5187
01:27:52,639 --> 01:27:54,790
what the outside world is but we do it

on input and that input

i i would hesitate to say it's not real

i i would hesitate to say it's not real
um because it's precisely how we do

5192
01:27:59,030 --> 01:27:59,040
um because it's precisely how we do
 

5193
01:27:59,040 --> 01:28:01,270
um because it's precisely how we do
understand the world we you know we have

01:28:01,270 --> 01:28:01,280
understand the world we you know we have

table it bangs its head on the table and

5214
01:28:23,990 --> 01:28:24,000
table it bangs its head on the table and
 

5215
01:28:24,000 --> 01:28:26,550
table it bangs its head on the table and
it hurts uh and

5216
01:28:26,550 --> 01:28:26,560
it hurts uh and
 

5217
01:28:26,560 --> 01:28:28,470
it hurts uh and
now you've got two inputs you've got one

5218
01:28:28,470 --> 01:28:28,480
now you've got two inputs you've got one
 

5219
01:28:28,480 --> 01:28:30,709
now you've got two inputs you've got one
pane from this sharp edge and number two

5220
01:28:30,709 --> 01:28:30,719
pane from this sharp edge and number two
 

5221
01:28:30,719 --> 01:28:32,229
pane from this sharp edge and number two
you probably you've touched it and

5222
01:28:32,229 --> 01:28:32,239
you probably you've touched it and
 

5223
01:28:32,239 --> 01:28:33,750
you probably you've touched it and
realized it's there it's a sharp edge

5224
01:28:33,750 --> 01:28:33,760
realized it's there it's a sharp edge
 

5225
01:28:33,760 --> 01:28:35,030
realized it's there it's a sharp edge
and you've got the visual input and you

5226
01:28:35,030 --> 01:28:35,040
and you've got the visual input and you
 

5227
01:28:35,040 --> 01:28:36,310
and you've got the visual input and you
put the three things together and think

5228
01:28:36,310 --> 01:28:36,320
put the three things together and think
 

5229
01:28:36,320 --> 01:28:38,229
put the three things together and think
i don't want to walk into a table again

5230
01:28:38,229 --> 01:28:38,239
i don't want to walk into a table again
 

5231
01:28:38,239 --> 01:28:40,629
i don't want to walk into a table again
so you're learning and and it's a

5232
01:28:40,629 --> 01:28:40,639
so you're learning and and it's a
 

5233
01:28:40,639 --> 01:28:43,430
so you're learning and and it's a
limited reality but it's a true reality

5234
01:28:43,430 --> 01:28:43,440
limited reality but it's a true reality
 

5235
01:28:43,440 --> 01:28:44,629
limited reality but it's a true reality
and if you don't learn that properly

5236
01:28:44,629 --> 01:28:44,639
and if you don't learn that properly
 

5237
01:28:44,639 --> 01:28:46,229
and if you don't learn that properly
then you will get eaten you will get hit

5238
01:28:46,229 --> 01:28:46,239
then you will get eaten you will get hit
 

5239
01:28:46,239 --> 01:28:48,550
then you will get eaten you will get hit
by a bus you will not survive

5240
01:28:48,550 --> 01:28:48,560
by a bus you will not survive
 

5241
01:28:48,560 --> 01:28:50,870
by a bus you will not survive
uh and same if you if you're in in in

5242
01:28:50,870 --> 01:28:50,880
uh and same if you if you're in in in
 

5243
01:28:50,880 --> 01:28:53,270
uh and same if you if you're in in in
some kind of uh

5244
01:28:53,270 --> 01:28:53,280
some kind of uh
 

5245
01:28:53,280 --> 01:28:54,870
some kind of uh
let's say computer construction of

5246
01:28:54,870 --> 01:28:54,880
let's say computer construction of
 

5247
01:28:54,880 --> 01:28:57,590
let's say computer construction of
reality i'm not in my ground here but if

5248
01:28:57,590 --> 01:28:57,600
reality i'm not in my ground here but if
 

5249
01:28:57,600 --> 01:28:59,830
reality i'm not in my ground here but if
if you construct the laws that this is

5250
01:28:59,830 --> 01:28:59,840
if you construct the laws that this is
 

5251
01:28:59,840 --> 01:29:03,590
if you construct the laws that this is
what reality is inside in inside this

5252
01:29:03,590 --> 01:29:03,600
what reality is inside in inside this
 

5253
01:29:03,600 --> 01:29:05,430
what reality is inside in inside this
then you play by those laws yeah well i

5254
01:29:05,430 --> 01:29:05,440
then you play by those laws yeah well i
 

5255
01:29:05,440 --> 01:29:07,430
then you play by those laws yeah well i
mean as long as the laws are consistent

5256
01:29:07,430 --> 01:29:07,440
mean as long as the laws are consistent
 

5257
01:29:07,440 --> 01:29:09,590
mean as long as the laws are consistent
so just like you said in the lab

5258
01:29:09,590 --> 01:29:09,600
so just like you said in the lab
 

5259
01:29:09,600 --> 01:29:10,870
so just like you said in the lab
the interesting thing about the

5260
01:29:10,870 --> 01:29:10,880
the interesting thing about the
 

5261
01:29:10,880 --> 01:29:13,110
the interesting thing about the
simulation question yes it's hard to

5262
01:29:13,110 --> 01:29:13,120
simulation question yes it's hard to
 

5263
01:29:13,120 --> 01:29:15,350
simulation question yes it's hard to
know if we're living inside a simulation

5264
01:29:15,350 --> 01:29:15,360
know if we're living inside a simulation
 

5265
01:29:15,360 --> 01:29:18,149
know if we're living inside a simulation
but also yes it's possible to do these

5266
01:29:18,149 --> 01:29:18,159
but also yes it's possible to do these
 

5267
01:29:18,159 --> 01:29:20,550
but also yes it's possible to do these
kinds of experiments in the lab now

5268
01:29:20,550 --> 01:29:20,560
kinds of experiments in the lab now
 

5269
01:29:20,560 --> 01:29:22,470
kinds of experiments in the lab now
more and more to me the interesting

5270
01:29:22,470 --> 01:29:22,480
more and more to me the interesting
 

5271
01:29:22,480 --> 01:29:23,669
more and more to me the interesting
question is

5272
01:29:23,669 --> 01:29:23,679
question is
 

5273
01:29:23,679 --> 01:29:24,870
question is
how

5274
01:29:24,870 --> 01:29:24,880
how
 

5275
01:29:24,880 --> 01:29:27,110
how
realistic does a virtual reality game

5276
01:29:27,110 --> 01:29:27,120
realistic does a virtual reality game
 

5277
01:29:27,120 --> 01:29:29,270
realistic does a virtual reality game
need to be for us to not be able to tell

5278
01:29:29,270 --> 01:29:29,280
need to be for us to not be able to tell
 

5279
01:29:29,280 --> 01:29:30,390
need to be for us to not be able to tell
the difference

5280
01:29:30,390 --> 01:29:30,400
the difference
 

5281
01:29:30,400 --> 01:29:33,350
the difference
a more interesting question to me is

5282
01:29:33,350 --> 01:29:33,360
a more interesting question to me is
 

5283
01:29:33,360 --> 01:29:36,310
a more interesting question to me is
how realistic

5284
01:29:36,310 --> 01:29:36,320
how realistic
 

5285
01:29:36,320 --> 01:29:37,110
how realistic
or

5286
01:29:37,110 --> 01:29:37,120
or
 

5287
01:29:37,120 --> 01:29:39,430
or
interesting does the virtual reality

01:29:39,430 --> 01:29:39,440
interesting does the virtual reality
 

5289
01:29:39,440 --> 01:29:41,510
interesting does the virtual reality

just a one-way flux of things it's also

just a one-way flux of things it's also
you have to walk into things you have to

5354
01:30:51,830 --> 01:30:51,840
you have to walk into things you have to
 

5355
01:30:51,840 --> 01:30:53,590
you have to walk into things you have to
hear things you have to put it together

5356
01:30:53,590 --> 01:30:53,600
hear things you have to put it together

01:30:53,600 --> 01:30:56,390
hear things you have to put it together
now if you've got just babies

5358
01:30:56,390 --> 01:30:56,400
now if you've got just babies

01:30:56,400 --> 01:30:59,030
now if you've got just babies

this i don't think they have that kind

5362
01:31:01,270 --> 01:31:01,280
this i don't think they have that kind
 

5363
01:31:01,280 --> 01:31:02,950
this i don't think they have that kind
of sensory input i don't think they

5364
01:31:02,950 --> 01:31:02,960
of sensory input i don't think they
 

5365
01:31:02,960 --> 01:31:04,870
of sensory input i don't think they
would have any way to make sense of new

5366
01:31:04,870 --> 01:31:04,880
would have any way to make sense of new

01:31:04,880 --> 01:31:05,750
would have any way to make sense of new
york

5368
01:31:05,750 --> 01:31:05,760
york
 

5369
01:31:05,760 --> 01:31:08,310
york
uh as a world that they're part of

5370
01:31:08,310 --> 01:31:08,320
uh as a world that they're part of
 

5371
01:31:08,320 --> 01:31:10,070
uh as a world that they're part of
the brain is just not developed in that

5372
01:31:10,070 --> 01:31:10,080
the brain is just not developed in that
 

5373
01:31:10,080 --> 01:31:12,310
the brain is just not developed in that
way so i can't make sense of new york in

5374
01:31:12,310 --> 01:31:12,320
way so i can't make sense of new york in
 

5375
01:31:12,320 --> 01:31:14,229
way so i can't make sense of new york in
this physical reality either but yeah i

5376
01:31:14,229 --> 01:31:14,239
this physical reality either but yeah i
 

5377
01:31:14,239 --> 01:31:17,270
this physical reality either but yeah i
mean but you said pain and walking into

5378
01:31:17,270 --> 01:31:17,280
mean but you said pain and walking into
 

5379
01:31:17,280 --> 01:31:19,590
mean but you said pain and walking into
things well you can create a pain signal

5380
01:31:19,590 --> 01:31:19,600
things well you can create a pain signal
 

5381
01:31:19,600 --> 01:31:21,750
things well you can create a pain signal
and as long as it's consistent

5382
01:31:21,750 --> 01:31:21,760
and as long as it's consistent
 

5383
01:31:21,760 --> 01:31:23,830
and as long as it's consistent
that certain things result in pain you

5384
01:31:23,830 --> 01:31:23,840
that certain things result in pain you
 

5385
01:31:23,840 --> 01:31:25,750
that certain things result in pain you
could start to construct a reality

5386
01:31:25,750 --> 01:31:25,760
could start to construct a reality
 

5387
01:31:25,760 --> 01:31:27,750
could start to construct a reality
there's some maybe maybe you disagree

5388
01:31:27,750 --> 01:31:27,760
there's some maybe maybe you disagree
 

5389
01:31:27,760 --> 01:31:32,070
there's some maybe maybe you disagree
with this but i think we are born

5390
01:31:32,070 --> 01:31:32,080
with this but i think we are born
 

5391
01:31:32,080 --> 01:31:34,310
with this but i think we are born
almost with a desire to be convinced by

01:31:34,310 --> 01:31:34,320
almost with a desire to be convinced by
 

5393
01:31:34,320 --> 01:31:35,669
almost with a desire to be convinced by
our reality

5394
01:31:35,669 --> 01:31:35,679
our reality
 

5395
01:31:35,679 --> 01:31:36,709
our reality
like a

5396
01:31:36,709 --> 01:31:36,719
like a
 

5397
01:31:36,719 --> 01:31:38,870
like a
desire to make sense of our reality oh

5398
01:31:38,870 --> 01:31:38,880
desire to make sense of our reality oh
 

5399
01:31:38,880 --> 01:31:40,550
desire to make sense of our reality oh
i'm sure we are yes okay so there's an

5400
01:31:40,550 --> 01:31:40,560
i'm sure we are yes okay so there's an
 

5401
01:31:40,560 --> 01:31:42,790
i'm sure we are yes okay so there's an
imperative so whatever that reality is

5402
01:31:42,790 --> 01:31:42,800
imperative so whatever that reality is
 

5403
01:31:42,800 --> 01:31:45,350
imperative so whatever that reality is
given to us like the table hurts fire's

5404
01:31:45,350 --> 01:31:45,360
given to us like the table hurts fire's
 

5405
01:31:45,360 --> 01:31:47,830
given to us like the table hurts fire's
hot yeah i think

5406
01:31:47,830 --> 01:31:47,840
hot yeah i think
 

5407
01:31:47,840 --> 01:31:49,830
hot yeah i think
we want to be deluded

5408
01:31:49,830 --> 01:31:49,840
we want to be deluded
 

5409
01:31:49,840 --> 01:31:52,950
we want to be deluded
in a sense that we want to make a simple

5410
01:31:52,950 --> 01:31:52,960
in a sense that we want to make a simple
 

5411
01:31:52,960 --> 01:31:55,350
in a sense that we want to make a simple
like einstein simple theory of the thing

5412
01:31:55,350 --> 01:31:55,360
like einstein simple theory of the thing
 

5413
01:31:55,360 --> 01:31:58,629
like einstein simple theory of the thing
around us we want that simplicity and so

5414
01:31:58,629 --> 01:31:58,639
around us we want that simplicity and so
 

5415
01:31:58,639 --> 01:32:00,550
around us we want that simplicity and so
um maybe

5416
01:32:00,550 --> 01:32:00,560
um maybe
 

5417
01:32:00,560 --> 01:32:02,390
um maybe
the hunger for the simplicity is the

5418
01:32:02,390 --> 01:32:02,400
the hunger for the simplicity is the
 

5419
01:32:02,400 --> 01:32:04,390
the hunger for the simplicity is the
thing that could be used to construct a

5420
01:32:04,390 --> 01:32:04,400
thing that could be used to construct a
 

5421
01:32:04,400 --> 01:32:06,310
thing that could be used to construct a
pretty dumb simulation

5422
01:32:06,310 --> 01:32:06,320
pretty dumb simulation
 

5423
01:32:06,320 --> 01:32:08,550
pretty dumb simulation
that that tricks us so maybe tricking

5424
01:32:08,550 --> 01:32:08,560
that that tricks us so maybe tricking
 

5425
01:32:08,560 --> 01:32:10,149
that that tricks us so maybe tricking

no i i don't i mean i this is not what i

5430
01:32:13,990 --> 01:32:14,000
no i i don't i mean i this is not what i
 

5431
01:32:14,000 --> 01:32:15,430
no i i don't i mean i this is not what i
work on so i don't know how close to it

5432
01:32:15,430 --> 01:32:15,440
work on so i don't know how close to it
 

5433
01:32:15,440 --> 01:32:17,510
work on so i don't know how close to it
we are anyone working but i i agree with

01:32:17,510 --> 01:32:17,520
we are anyone working but i i agree with

01:32:17,520 --> 01:32:20,229
we are anyone working but i i agree with
you but yeah i'm not sure that it's

5436
01:32:20,229 --> 01:32:20,239
you but yeah i'm not sure that it's
 

5437
01:32:20,239 --> 01:32:22,149
you but yeah i'm not sure that it's
a morally justifiable thing to do but

5438
01:32:22,149 --> 01:32:22,159
a morally justifiable thing to do but
 

5439
01:32:22,159 --> 01:32:23,110
a morally justifiable thing to do but
it's it's

5440
01:32:23,110 --> 01:32:23,120
it's it's
 

5441
01:32:23,120 --> 01:32:25,189
it's it's
is it possible in principle

5442
01:32:25,189 --> 01:32:25,199
is it possible in principle
 

5443
01:32:25,199 --> 01:32:28,390
is it possible in principle
um i think it'll be very difficult

5444
01:32:28,390 --> 01:32:28,400
um i think it'll be very difficult
 

5445
01:32:28,400 --> 01:32:30,550
um i think it'll be very difficult
but i don't see why in principle it

5446
01:32:30,550 --> 01:32:30,560
but i don't see why in principle it
 

5447
01:32:30,560 --> 01:32:32,070
but i don't see why in principle it
wouldn't be possible and i agree with

5448
01:32:32,070 --> 01:32:32,080
wouldn't be possible and i agree with
 

5449
01:32:32,080 --> 01:32:34,709
wouldn't be possible and i agree with
you that it's it's um that we try to

5450
01:32:34,709 --> 01:32:34,719
you that it's it's um that we try to
 

5451
01:32:34,719 --> 01:32:36,550
you that it's it's um that we try to
understand the world we try to integrate

5452
01:32:36,550 --> 01:32:36,560
understand the world we try to integrate
 

5453
01:32:36,560 --> 01:32:38,149
understand the world we try to integrate
the sensory inputs that we have and we

5454
01:32:38,149 --> 01:32:38,159
the sensory inputs that we have and we
 

5455
01:32:38,159 --> 01:32:40,229
the sensory inputs that we have and we
try to come up with a hypothesis that

5456
01:32:40,229 --> 01:32:40,239
try to come up with a hypothesis that
 

5457
01:32:40,239 --> 01:32:41,830
try to come up with a hypothesis that
explains what's going on

5458
01:32:41,830 --> 01:32:41,840
explains what's going on
 

5459
01:32:41,840 --> 01:32:43,590
explains what's going on
i think though

5460
01:32:43,590 --> 01:32:43,600
i think though
 

5461
01:32:43,600 --> 01:32:45,350
i think though
that we have

5462
01:32:45,350 --> 01:32:45,360
that we have
 

5463
01:32:45,360 --> 01:32:47,030
that we have
huge input from

5464
01:32:47,030 --> 01:32:47,040
huge input from
 

5465
01:32:47,040 --> 01:32:49,110
huge input from
the social context that we're in we

5466
01:32:49,110 --> 01:32:49,120
the social context that we're in we
 

5467
01:32:49,120 --> 01:32:50,790
the social context that we're in we
don't do it by ourselves we don't kind

5468
01:32:50,790 --> 01:32:50,800
don't do it by ourselves we don't kind
 

5469
01:32:50,800 --> 01:32:52,870
don't do it by ourselves we don't kind
of blunder around in a universe by

5470
01:32:52,870 --> 01:32:52,880
of blunder around in a universe by
 

5471
01:32:52,880 --> 01:32:55,830
of blunder around in a universe by
ourself and understand the whole thing

5472
01:32:55,830 --> 01:32:55,840
ourself and understand the whole thing
 

5473
01:32:55,840 --> 01:32:57,990
ourself and understand the whole thing
we're told by the people around us uh

5474
01:32:57,990 --> 01:32:58,000
we're told by the people around us uh
 

5475
01:32:58,000 --> 01:32:59,350
we're told by the people around us uh
what things are and what they do and

5476
01:32:59,350 --> 01:32:59,360
what things are and what they do and
 

5477
01:32:59,360 --> 01:33:01,110
what things are and what they do and
that you know language is coming in here

5478
01:33:01,110 --> 01:33:01,120
that you know language is coming in here
 

5479
01:33:01,120 --> 01:33:02,709
that you know language is coming in here
and so on so

5480
01:33:02,709 --> 01:33:02,719
and so on so
 

5481
01:33:02,719 --> 01:33:04,070
and so on so
it would have to be an extremely

5482
01:33:04,070 --> 01:33:04,080
it would have to be an extremely
 

5483
01:33:04,080 --> 01:33:06,149
it would have to be an extremely
impressive simulation to simulate all of

5484
01:33:06,149 --> 01:33:06,159
impressive simulation to simulate all of
 

5485
01:33:06,159 --> 01:33:08,229
impressive simulation to simulate all of
that

5486
01:33:08,229 --> 01:33:08,239
that
 

5487
01:33:08,239 --> 01:33:10,790
that
yeah simulate all of that including the

5488
01:33:10,790 --> 01:33:10,800
yeah simulate all of that including the
 

5489
01:33:10,800 --> 01:33:12,709
yeah simulate all of that including the
social construct this the the thing the

5490
01:33:12,709 --> 01:33:12,719
social construct this the the thing the
 

5491
01:33:12,719 --> 01:33:14,950
social construct this the the thing the
the spread of ideas and the the the

5492
01:33:14,950 --> 01:33:14,960
the spread of ideas and the the the
 

5493
01:33:14,960 --> 01:33:16,629
the spread of ideas and the the the
exchange of ideas i don't know and but

5494
01:33:16,629 --> 01:33:16,639
exchange of ideas i don't know and but
 

5495
01:33:16,639 --> 01:33:18,070
exchange of ideas i don't know and but
those questions are really important to

5496
01:33:18,070 --> 01:33:18,080
those questions are really important to
 

5497
01:33:18,080 --> 01:33:19,510
those questions are really important to
understand as we

5498
01:33:19,510 --> 01:33:19,520
understand as we
 

5499
01:33:19,520 --> 01:33:21,910
understand as we
become more and more digital creatures

5500
01:33:21,910 --> 01:33:21,920
become more and more digital creatures
 

5501
01:33:21,920 --> 01:33:23,669
become more and more digital creatures
it seems like the next step of evolution

5502
01:33:23,669 --> 01:33:23,679
it seems like the next step of evolution
 

5503
01:33:23,679 --> 01:33:25,030
it seems like the next step of evolution
is us becoming

5504
01:33:25,030 --> 01:33:25,040
is us becoming
 

5505
01:33:25,040 --> 01:33:26,709
is us becoming
partial all the same mechanisms we've

5506
01:33:26,709 --> 01:33:26,719
partial all the same mechanisms we've
 

5507
01:33:26,719 --> 01:33:28,149
partial all the same mechanisms we've
talked about

5508
01:33:28,149 --> 01:33:28,159
talked about
 

5509
01:33:28,159 --> 01:33:30,149
talked about
are becoming more and more plugged in

5510
01:33:30,149 --> 01:33:30,159
are becoming more and more plugged in
 

5511
01:33:30,159 --> 01:33:31,669
are becoming more and more plugged in
into the machine

5512
01:33:31,669 --> 01:33:31,679
into the machine
 

5513
01:33:31,679 --> 01:33:33,990
into the machine
we're becoming cyborgs

5514
01:33:33,990 --> 01:33:34,000
we're becoming cyborgs
 

5515
01:33:34,000 --> 01:33:36,470
we're becoming cyborgs
and there's an interesting interplay

5516
01:33:36,470 --> 01:33:36,480
and there's an interesting interplay
 

5517
01:33:36,480 --> 01:33:38,950
and there's an interesting interplay
between wires and biology

5518
01:33:38,950 --> 01:33:38,960
between wires and biology
 

5519
01:33:38,960 --> 01:33:39,990
between wires and biology
um

5520
01:33:39,990 --> 01:33:40,000
um
 

5521
01:33:40,000 --> 01:33:41,750
um
you know zeros and ones and the

5522
01:33:41,750 --> 01:33:41,760
you know zeros and ones and the
 

5523
01:33:41,760 --> 01:33:45,430
you know zeros and ones and the
biological systems and i don't think

5524
01:33:45,430 --> 01:33:45,440
biological systems and i don't think
 

5525
01:33:45,440 --> 01:33:47,030
biological systems and i don't think
you can just

5526
01:33:47,030 --> 01:33:47,040
you can just
 

5527
01:33:47,040 --> 01:33:48,709
you can just
i don't think we'll have the luxury to

5528
01:33:48,709 --> 01:33:48,719
i don't think we'll have the luxury to
 

5529
01:33:48,719 --> 01:33:50,550
i don't think we'll have the luxury to
see humans as disjoint from the

5530
01:33:50,550 --> 01:33:50,560
see humans as disjoint from the
 

5531
01:33:50,560 --> 01:33:53,350
see humans as disjoint from the
technology we've created for much longer

5532
01:33:53,350 --> 01:33:53,360
technology we've created for much longer
 

5533
01:33:53,360 --> 01:33:56,470
technology we've created for much longer
we are in organisms that's um

5534
01:33:56,470 --> 01:33:56,480
we are in organisms that's um
 

5535
01:33:56,480 --> 01:33:57,350
we are in organisms that's um
yeah

5536
01:33:57,350 --> 01:33:57,360
yeah
 

5537
01:33:57,360 --> 01:33:58,629
yeah
i mean i

5538
01:33:58,629 --> 01:33:58,639
i mean i
 

5539
01:33:58,639 --> 01:34:00,149
i mean i
agree with you

5540
01:34:00,149 --> 01:34:00,159
agree with you
 

5541
01:34:00,159 --> 01:34:02,229
agree with you
but

5542
01:34:02,229 --> 01:34:02,239
but
 

5543
01:34:02,239 --> 01:34:04,870
but
we come really with this to

5544
01:34:04,870 --> 01:34:04,880
we come really with this to
 

5545
01:34:04,880 --> 01:34:07,110
we come really with this to
consciousness yes and is there a

5546
01:34:07,110 --> 01:34:07,120
consciousness yes and is there a
 

5547
01:34:07,120 --> 01:34:09,189
consciousness yes and is there a
distinction there because what you're

5548
01:34:09,189 --> 01:34:09,199
distinction there because what you're
 

5549
01:34:09,199 --> 01:34:11,110
distinction there because what you're
saying the natural end point says we are

5550
01:34:11,110 --> 01:34:11,120
saying the natural end point says we are
 

5551
01:34:11,120 --> 01:34:12,790
saying the natural end point says we are
indistinguishable that if you are

5552
01:34:12,790 --> 01:34:12,800
indistinguishable that if you are
 

5553
01:34:12,800 --> 01:34:14,870
indistinguishable that if you are
capable of building

5554
01:34:14,870 --> 01:34:14,880
capable of building
 

5555
01:34:14,880 --> 01:34:15,750
capable of building
a

5556
01:34:15,750 --> 01:34:15,760
a
 

5557
01:34:15,760 --> 01:34:16,950
a
an ai

5558
01:34:16,950 --> 01:34:16,960
an ai
 

5559
01:34:16,960 --> 01:34:19,590
an ai
which is sufficiently close and similar

5560
01:34:19,590 --> 01:34:19,600
which is sufficiently close and similar
 

5561
01:34:19,600 --> 01:34:22,149
which is sufficiently close and similar
that we merge with it then then

5562
01:34:22,149 --> 01:34:22,159
that we merge with it then then
 

5563
01:34:22,159 --> 01:34:24,709
that we merge with it then then
to all intents and purposes that ai is

5564
01:34:24,709 --> 01:34:24,719
to all intents and purposes that ai is
 

5565
01:34:24,719 --> 01:34:26,629
to all intents and purposes that ai is
conscious as we know it

5566
01:34:26,629 --> 01:34:26,639
conscious as we know it
 

5567
01:34:26,639 --> 01:34:27,830
conscious as we know it
um

5568
01:34:27,830 --> 01:34:27,840
um
 

5569
01:34:27,840 --> 01:34:29,350
um
and i don't

5570
01:34:29,350 --> 01:34:29,360
and i don't
 

5571
01:34:29,360 --> 01:34:31,430
and i don't
i don't have a strong view but i have a

5572
01:34:31,430 --> 01:34:31,440
i don't have a strong view but i have a
 

5573
01:34:31,440 --> 01:34:33,189
i don't have a strong view but i have a
view

view
 

5575
01:34:33,199 --> 01:34:34,950
view
um

5576
01:34:34,950 --> 01:34:34,960
um
 

5577
01:34:34,960 --> 01:34:36,629
um
and i i wrote about it in the epilogue

5578
01:34:36,629 --> 01:34:36,639
and i i wrote about it in the epilogue
 

5579
01:34:36,639 --> 01:34:38,709
and i i wrote about it in the epilogue
to my last book because 10

5580
01:34:38,709 --> 01:34:38,719
to my last book because 10

01:34:38,719 --> 01:34:41,270
to my last book because 10
years ago i i

5582
01:34:41,270 --> 01:34:41,280
years ago i i
 

5583
01:34:41,280 --> 01:34:43,669
years ago i i
wrote a chapter in in a book called life

5584
01:34:43,669 --> 01:34:43,679
wrote a chapter in in a book called life
 

5585
01:34:43,679 --> 01:34:45,750
wrote a chapter in in a book called life
ascending about consciousness

5586
01:34:45,750 --> 01:34:45,760
ascending about consciousness
 

5587
01:34:45,760 --> 01:34:47,510
ascending about consciousness
and the subtitle of life ascending was

5588
01:34:47,510 --> 01:34:47,520
and the subtitle of life ascending was
 

5589
01:34:47,520 --> 01:34:49,270
and the subtitle of life ascending was
was the ten great inventions of

5590
01:34:49,270 --> 01:34:49,280
was the ten great inventions of
 

5591
01:34:49,280 --> 01:34:50,950
was the ten great inventions of
evolution and i couldn't possibly write

5592
01:34:50,950 --> 01:34:50,960
evolution and i couldn't possibly write
 

5593
01:34:50,960 --> 01:34:52,470
evolution and i couldn't possibly write
a book with a subtitle like that that

5594
01:34:52,470 --> 01:34:52,480
a book with a subtitle like that that
 

5595
01:34:52,480 --> 01:34:54,310
a book with a subtitle like that that
did not include consciousness

5596
01:34:54,310 --> 01:34:54,320
did not include consciousness
 

5597
01:34:54,320 --> 01:34:57,109
did not include consciousness

in language like be able to have a
conversation and there seems to be not a

gradual increase but a face transition
 

5879

network and why does such a face
 

5887
01:40:04,800 --> 01:40:06,950

transition happen anyway that that sort

5888
01:40:06,950 --> 01:40:06,960
transition happen anyway that that sort
 

5889
01:40:06,960 --> 01:40:10,310

01:40:47,350 --> 01:40:47,360
you're almost basically uh what is notes
 

5923
01:40:47,360 --> 01:40:49,109
you're almost basically uh what is notes
from underground but dusty like just

5924
01:40:49,109 --> 01:40:49,119
from underground but dusty like just
 

5925
01:40:49,119 --> 01:40:52,870
from underground but dusty like just
just constantly complaining about life

5926
01:40:52,870 --> 01:40:52,880
just constantly complaining about life
 

5927
01:40:52,880 --> 01:40:54,070
just constantly complaining about life
no they're

5928
01:40:54,070 --> 01:40:54,080
no they're
 

5929
01:40:54,080 --> 01:40:56,149
no they're
capturing the full

5930
01:40:56,149 --> 01:40:56,159
capturing the full
 

5931
01:40:56,159 --> 01:40:58,870
capturing the full
rollercoaster of human emotion the

5932
01:40:58,870 --> 01:40:58,880
rollercoaster of human emotion the
 

5933
01:40:58,880 --> 01:41:01,270
rollercoaster of human emotion the
excitement the bliss the connection

5934
01:41:01,270 --> 01:41:01,280
excitement the bliss the connection
 

5935
01:41:01,280 --> 01:41:03,430
excitement the bliss the connection
um the empathy and all that kind of

5936
01:41:03,430 --> 01:41:03,440
um the empathy and all that kind of
 

5937
01:41:03,440 --> 01:41:05,910
um the empathy and all that kind of
stuff and then the selfishness

5938
01:41:05,910 --> 01:41:05,920
stuff and then the selfishness
 

5939
01:41:05,920 --> 01:41:07,910
stuff and then the selfishness
the the anger

5940
01:41:07,910 --> 01:41:07,920
the the anger
 

5941
01:41:07,920 --> 01:41:09,350
the the anger
the the depression all that kind of

5942
01:41:09,350 --> 01:41:09,360
the the depression all that kind of
 

5943
01:41:09,360 --> 01:41:11,669
the the depression all that kind of
stuff the capturing all of that

5944
01:41:11,669 --> 01:41:11,679
stuff the capturing all of that
 

5945
01:41:11,679 --> 01:41:14,470
stuff the capturing all of that
and be able to experience it deeply like

5946
01:41:14,470 --> 01:41:14,480
and be able to experience it deeply like
 

5947
01:41:14,480 --> 01:41:16,149
and be able to experience it deeply like
it's the most important

5948
01:41:16,149 --> 01:41:16,159
it's the most important
 

5949
01:41:16,159 --> 01:41:17,590
it's the most important
thing you could possibly experience

5950
01:41:17,590 --> 01:41:17,600
thing you could possibly experience
 

5951
01:41:17,600 --> 01:41:20,310
thing you could possibly experience
today the highest highs the lowest lows

5952
01:41:20,310 --> 01:41:20,320
today the highest highs the lowest lows
 

5953
01:41:20,320 --> 01:41:24,390
today the highest highs the lowest lows
this is it my life will be over this

5954
01:41:24,390 --> 01:41:24,400
this is it my life will be over this
 

5955
01:41:24,400 --> 01:41:26,629
this is it my life will be over this
i cannot possibly go on that feeling and

5956
01:41:26,629 --> 01:41:26,639
i cannot possibly go on that feeling and
 

5957
01:41:26,639 --> 01:41:29,030
i cannot possibly go on that feeling and
then like after a nap

5958
01:41:29,030 --> 01:41:29,040
then like after a nap
 

5959
01:41:29,040 --> 01:41:30,629
then like after a nap
you're feeling amazing

5960
01:41:30,629 --> 01:41:30,639
you're feeling amazing
 

5961
01:41:30,639 --> 01:41:33,750
you're feeling amazing
that might be something that emerges so

5962
01:41:33,750 --> 01:41:33,760
that might be something that emerges so
 

5963
01:41:33,760 --> 01:41:35,590
that might be something that emerges so
why would a nap

5964
01:41:35,590 --> 01:41:35,600
why would a nap
 

5965
01:41:35,600 --> 01:41:36,390
why would a nap
make

5966
01:41:36,390 --> 01:41:36,400
make
 

5967
01:41:36,400 --> 01:41:41,669
make
an ai being feel better

5968
01:41:41,669 --> 01:41:41,679

 

5969
01:41:41,679 --> 01:41:42,390

the

5970
01:41:42,390 --> 01:41:42,400
the
 

5971
01:41:42,400 --> 01:41:43,590
the
first of all we don't know that for a

5972
01:41:43,590 --> 01:41:43,600
first of all we don't know that for a
 

5973
01:41:43,600 --> 01:41:46,470
first of all we don't know that for a
human either right but we do know that

5974
01:41:46,470 --> 01:41:46,480
human either right but we do know that
 

5975
01:41:46,480 --> 01:41:48,229
human either right but we do know that
that's actually true for many people

5976
01:41:48,229 --> 01:41:48,239
that's actually true for many people
 

5977
01:41:48,239 --> 01:41:50,629
that's actually true for many people
much of the time you may be depressed

5978
01:41:50,629 --> 01:41:50,639
much of the time you may be depressed
 

5979
01:41:50,639 --> 01:41:53,270
much of the time you may be depressed
when you do in fact feel better so

5980
01:41:53,270 --> 01:41:53,280
when you do in fact feel better so
 

5981
01:41:53,280 --> 01:41:55,030
when you do in fact feel better so
oh you are actually asking the technical

5982
01:41:55,030 --> 01:41:55,040
oh you are actually asking the technical
 

5983
01:41:55,040 --> 01:41:57,590
oh you are actually asking the technical
question there is there uh so that's a

5984
01:41:57,590 --> 01:41:57,600
question there is there uh so that's a
 

5985
01:41:57,600 --> 01:41:59,830
question there is there uh so that's a
very there's a biological answer to that

5986
01:41:59,830 --> 01:41:59,840
very there's a biological answer to that
 

5987
01:41:59,840 --> 01:42:01,590
very there's a biological answer to that
and so the question is whether ai needs

5988
01:42:01,590 --> 01:42:01,600
and so the question is whether ai needs
 

5989
01:42:01,600 --> 01:42:03,830
and so the question is whether ai needs
to have the same kind of attachment to

5990
01:42:03,830 --> 01:42:03,840
to have the same kind of attachment to
 

5991
01:42:03,840 --> 01:42:06,390
to have the same kind of attachment to
its body and bodily function and

5992
01:42:06,390 --> 01:42:06,400
its body and bodily function and
 

5993
01:42:06,400 --> 01:42:08,470
its body and bodily function and
preservation

5994
01:42:08,470 --> 01:42:08,480
preservation
 

5995
01:42:08,480 --> 01:42:11,750
preservation
of the brain's successful function

5996
01:42:11,750 --> 01:42:11,760
of the brain's successful function
 

5997
01:42:11,760 --> 01:42:13,109
of the brain's successful function
of

5998
01:42:13,109 --> 01:42:13,119
of
 

5999
01:42:13,119 --> 01:42:14,790
of
self-preservation essentially in some

6000
01:42:14,790 --> 01:42:14,800
self-preservation essentially in some
 

6001
01:42:14,800 --> 01:42:16,950
self-preservation essentially in some
deep biological sense

6002
01:42:16,950 --> 01:42:16,960
deep biological sense
 

6003
01:42:16,960 --> 01:42:19,830
deep biological sense
i mean i to my mind it comes back round

6004
01:42:19,830 --> 01:42:19,840
i mean i to my mind it comes back round
 

6005
01:42:19,840 --> 01:42:21,189
i mean i to my mind it comes back round
to the problem we were talking about

6006
01:42:21,189 --> 01:42:21,199
to the problem we were talking about
 

6007
01:42:21,199 --> 01:42:23,430
to the problem we were talking about
before about simulations and sensory

6008
01:42:23,430 --> 01:42:23,440
before about simulations and sensory
 

6009
01:42:23,440 --> 01:42:26,229
before about simulations and sensory
input and learning what all of this

6010
01:42:26,229 --> 01:42:26,239
input and learning what all of this
 

6011
01:42:26,239 --> 01:42:28,470
input and learning what all of this
stuff means

6012
01:42:28,470 --> 01:42:28,480
stuff means
 

6013
01:42:28,480 --> 01:42:30,390
stuff means
and life and death

6014
01:42:30,390 --> 01:42:30,400
and life and death
 

6015
01:42:30,400 --> 01:42:31,350
and life and death
um

6016
01:42:31,350 --> 01:42:31,360
um
 

6017
01:42:31,360 --> 01:42:34,149
um
that that biology unlike society has a

6018
01:42:34,149 --> 01:42:34,159
that that biology unlike society has a
 

6019
01:42:34,159 --> 01:42:36,629
that that biology unlike society has a
death penalty over everything and

6020
01:42:36,629 --> 01:42:36,639
death penalty over everything and
 

6021
01:42:36,639 --> 01:42:38,390
death penalty over everything and
natural selection works on that death

6022
01:42:38,390 --> 01:42:38,400
natural selection works on that death
 

6023
01:42:38,400 --> 01:42:42,229
natural selection works on that death
penalty that if you make this

6024
01:42:42,229 --> 01:42:42,239

 

6025
01:42:42,239 --> 01:42:44,229

decision wrongly

6026
01:42:44,229 --> 01:42:44,239
decision wrongly
 

6027
01:42:44,239 --> 01:42:47,270
decision wrongly
you die

6028
01:42:47,270 --> 01:42:47,280

 

6029
01:42:47,280 --> 01:42:48,149

and

6030
01:42:48,149 --> 01:42:48,159
and
 

6031
01:42:48,159 --> 01:42:50,229
and
the next generation is represented by

6032
01:42:50,229 --> 01:42:50,239
the next generation is represented by
 

6033
01:42:50,239 --> 01:42:51,669
the next generation is represented by
beings that

6034
01:42:51,669 --> 01:42:51,679
beings that
 

6035
01:42:51,679 --> 01:42:53,510
beings that
made a slightly different decision

6036
01:42:53,510 --> 01:42:53,520
made a slightly different decision
 

6037
01:42:53,520 --> 01:42:54,830
made a slightly different decision
on balance

6038
01:42:54,830 --> 01:42:54,840
on balance
 

6039
01:42:54,840 --> 01:42:56,470
on balance
um

6040
01:42:56,470 --> 01:42:56,480
um
 

6041
01:42:56,480 --> 01:42:57,590
um
and that is something that's

6042
01:42:57,590 --> 01:42:57,600
and that is something that's
 

6043
01:42:57,600 --> 01:43:01,030
and that is something that's
intrinsically

6044
01:43:01,030 --> 01:43:01,040

 

6045
01:43:01,040 --> 01:43:02,470

difficult to simulate in all this

6046
01:43:02,470 --> 01:43:02,480
difficult to simulate in all this
 

6047
01:43:02,480 --> 01:43:04,709
difficult to simulate in all this
richness i i would say

6048
01:43:04,709 --> 01:43:04,719
richness i i would say
 

6049
01:43:04,719 --> 01:43:05,990
richness i i would say
um

6050
01:43:05,990 --> 01:43:06,000
um
 

6051
01:43:06,000 --> 01:43:09,030
um
so so what is

6052
01:43:09,030 --> 01:43:09,040

 

6053
01:43:09,040 --> 01:43:11,030

death in all its richness

6054
01:43:11,030 --> 01:43:11,040
death in all its richness
 

6055
01:43:11,040 --> 01:43:14,550
death in all its richness
yes the our relationship with death

6056
01:43:14,550 --> 01:43:14,560
yes the our relationship with death
 

6057
01:43:14,560 --> 01:43:17,750
yes the our relationship with death
or or or the whole of it so which when

6058
01:43:17,750 --> 01:43:17,760
or or or the whole of it so which when
 

6059
01:43:17,760 --> 01:43:19,990
or or or the whole of it so which when
you say richness of course

6060
01:43:19,990 --> 01:43:20,000
you say richness of course
 

6061
01:43:20,000 --> 01:43:22,070
you say richness of course
there's a lot in that yeah which is hard

6062
01:43:22,070 --> 01:43:22,080
there's a lot in that yeah which is hard
 

6063
01:43:22,080 --> 01:43:23,750
there's a lot in that yeah which is hard
to simulate

6064
01:43:23,750 --> 01:43:23,760
to simulate
 

6065
01:43:23,760 --> 01:43:25,430
to simulate
what what's the what's part of the

6066
01:43:25,430 --> 01:43:25,440
what what's the what's part of the
 

6067
01:43:25,440 --> 01:43:27,590
what what's the what's part of the
richness that's hard to simulate

6068
01:43:27,590 --> 01:43:27,600
richness that's hard to simulate
 

6069
01:43:27,600 --> 01:43:29,270
richness that's hard to simulate
uh i suppose the

6070
01:43:29,270 --> 01:43:29,280
uh i suppose the
 

6071
01:43:29,280 --> 01:43:31,350
uh i suppose the
complexity of the environment and your

6072
01:43:31,350 --> 01:43:31,360
complexity of the environment and your
 

6073
01:43:31,360 --> 01:43:33,669
complexity of the environment and your
position in that or the position of an

6074
01:43:33,669 --> 01:43:33,679
position in that or the position of an
 

6075
01:43:33,679 --> 01:43:36,070
position in that or the position of an
organism in that environment in the full

6076
01:43:36,070 --> 01:43:36,080
organism in that environment in the full
 

6077
01:43:36,080 --> 01:43:37,910
organism in that environment in the full
richness of that environment over its

6078
01:43:37,910 --> 01:43:37,920
richness of that environment over its
 

6079
01:43:37,920 --> 01:43:40,470
richness of that environment over its
entire life over multiple generations

6080
01:43:40,470 --> 01:43:40,480
entire life over multiple generations
 

6081
01:43:40,480 --> 01:43:42,709
entire life over multiple generations
with changes in gene

6082
01:43:42,709 --> 01:43:42,719
with changes in gene
 

6083
01:43:42,719 --> 01:43:44,229
with changes in gene
sequence over those generations so

6084
01:43:44,229 --> 01:43:44,239
sequence over those generations so
 

6085
01:43:44,239 --> 01:43:45,830
sequence over those generations so
slight changes in the makeup of those

6086
01:43:45,830 --> 01:43:45,840
slight changes in the makeup of those
 

6087
01:43:45,840 --> 01:43:48,550
slight changes in the makeup of those
individuals over generations but if you

6088
01:43:48,550 --> 01:43:48,560
individuals over generations but if you
 

6089
01:43:48,560 --> 01:43:50,550
individuals over generations but if you
take it back to the level of single

6090
01:43:50,550 --> 01:43:50,560
take it back to the level of single
 

6091
01:43:50,560 --> 01:43:54,070
take it back to the level of single
cells um which i do in in in the book

6092
01:43:54,070 --> 01:43:54,080
cells um which i do in in in the book
 

6093
01:43:54,080 --> 01:43:56,390
cells um which i do in in in the book
and and ask how do

6094
01:43:56,390 --> 01:43:56,400
and and ask how do
 

6095
01:43:56,400 --> 01:43:59,270
and and ask how do
how how does a single cell

6096
01:43:59,270 --> 01:43:59,280
how how does a single cell
 

6097
01:43:59,280 --> 01:44:01,430
how how does a single cell
in effect know it exists as an unit as

6098
01:44:01,430 --> 01:44:01,440
in effect know it exists as an unit as
 

6099
01:44:01,440 --> 01:44:03,910
in effect know it exists as an unit as
an entity i mean no in inverted commas

6100
01:44:03,910 --> 01:44:03,920
an entity i mean no in inverted commas
 

6101
01:44:03,920 --> 01:44:05,830
an entity i mean no in inverted commas
obviously it doesn't know

6102
01:44:05,830 --> 01:44:05,840
obviously it doesn't know
 

6103
01:44:05,840 --> 01:44:06,950
obviously it doesn't know
anything

6104
01:44:06,950 --> 01:44:06,960
anything
 

6105
01:44:06,960 --> 01:44:09,270
anything
but it acts as a unit and it acts with

6106
01:44:09,270 --> 01:44:09,280
but it acts as a unit and it acts with
 

6107
01:44:09,280 --> 01:44:11,830
but it acts as a unit and it acts with
astonishing

6108
01:44:11,830 --> 01:44:11,840
astonishing
 

6109
01:44:11,840 --> 01:44:14,550
astonishing
precision as a unit

6110
01:44:14,550 --> 01:44:14,560
precision as a unit
 

6111
01:44:14,560 --> 01:44:17,189
precision as a unit
and i had suggested that that's linked

6112
01:44:17,189 --> 01:44:17,199
and i had suggested that that's linked
 

6113
01:44:17,199 --> 01:44:18,709
and i had suggested that that's linked
to the electrical fields on on the

6114
01:44:18,709 --> 01:44:18,719
to the electrical fields on on the
 

6115
01:44:18,719 --> 01:44:20,709
to the electrical fields on on the
membranes themselves and that they give

6116
01:44:20,709 --> 01:44:20,719
membranes themselves and that they give
 

6117
01:44:20,719 --> 01:44:22,870
membranes themselves and that they give
some indication of how am i doing in

6118
01:44:22,870 --> 01:44:22,880
some indication of how am i doing in
 

6119
01:44:22,880 --> 01:44:24,629
some indication of how am i doing in
relation to my environment as a kind of

6120
01:44:24,629 --> 01:44:24,639
relation to my environment as a kind of
 

6121
01:44:24,639 --> 01:44:28,229
relation to my environment as a kind of
real-time feedback on the world

6122
01:44:28,229 --> 01:44:28,239
real-time feedback on the world
 

6123
01:44:28,239 --> 01:44:29,189
real-time feedback on the world
and

6124
01:44:29,189 --> 01:44:29,199
and
 

6125
01:44:29,199 --> 01:44:31,910
and
this is something physical

6126
01:44:31,910 --> 01:44:31,920
this is something physical
 

6127
01:44:31,920 --> 01:44:33,430
this is something physical
which can be

6128
01:44:33,430 --> 01:44:33,440
which can be
 

6129
01:44:33,440 --> 01:44:35,350
which can be
selected over generations that if you

6130
01:44:35,350 --> 01:44:35,360
selected over generations that if you
 

6131
01:44:35,360 --> 01:44:36,070

i have a moment of blind panic and run
 

6145
01:44:48,560 --> 01:44:50,790
i have a moment of blind panic and run
um as a bacterium or something you have

01:44:50,790 --> 01:44:50,800
um as a bacterium or something you have
 

6147
01:44:50,800 --> 01:44:53,030
um as a bacterium or something you have
a you know some electrical discharge

6148
01:44:53,030 --> 01:44:53,040
a you know some electrical discharge
 

6149
01:44:53,040 --> 01:44:55,189
a you know some electrical discharge
that says blind panic and it it runs

6150
01:44:55,189 --> 01:44:55,199
that says blind panic and it it runs
 

6151
01:44:55,199 --> 01:44:57,430
that says blind panic and it it runs
whatever it may be and you associate

6152
01:44:57,430 --> 01:44:57,440
whatever it may be and you associate
 

6153
01:44:57,440 --> 01:44:59,669
whatever it may be and you associate
over generations multiple generations

over generations multiple generations
 

6155
01:44:59,679 --> 01:45:02,709
over generations multiple generations
that this electrical phase that i'm in

6156
01:45:02,709 --> 01:45:02,719
that this electrical phase that i'm in
 

6157
01:45:02,719 --> 01:45:05,270
that this electrical phase that i'm in
now is associated with

now is associated with
 

6159
01:45:05,280 --> 01:45:07,910
now is associated with
a response like that and it's easy to

6160
01:45:07,910 --> 01:45:07,920
a response like that and it's easy to
 

6161
01:45:07,920 --> 01:45:10,870
a response like that and it's easy to
see how feelings come in through

6162
01:45:10,870 --> 01:45:10,880
see how feelings come in through
 

6163
01:45:10,880 --> 01:45:12,390
see how feelings come in through

how am i doing and then you you

6174
01:45:22,550 --> 01:45:22,560
how am i doing and then you you
 

6175
01:45:22,560 --> 01:45:24,550
how am i doing and then you you
complexify the system and yes i have no

6176
01:45:24,550 --> 01:45:24,560
complexify the system and yes i have no
 

6177
01:45:24,560 --> 01:45:26,950
complexify the system and yes i have no
problem with a with with phase

01:45:29,669 --> 01:45:29,679
transition and i you know
 

6181
01:45:29,679 --> 01:45:31,910

can can all of this be done

6182
01:45:31,910 --> 01:45:31,920
can can all of this be done
 

6183
01:45:31,920 --> 01:45:33,030
can can all of this be done
um

6184
01:45:33,030 --> 01:45:33,040
um
 

6185
01:45:33,040 --> 01:45:35,590
um
purely by

6186
01:45:35,590 --> 01:45:35,600
purely by
 

6187
01:45:35,600 --> 01:45:39,189
purely by
the language by the the the issues with

6188
01:45:39,189 --> 01:45:39,199
the language by the the the issues with
 

6189
01:45:39,199 --> 01:45:42,470
the language by the the the issues with
how the system understands itself

6190
01:45:42,470 --> 01:45:42,480
how the system understands itself
 

6191
01:45:42,480 --> 01:45:44,629
how the system understands itself
maybe it can i honestly don't know

6192
01:45:44,629 --> 01:45:44,639
maybe it can i honestly don't know
 

6193
01:45:44,639 --> 01:45:46,870
maybe it can i honestly don't know
um but i i you know the philosophers for

6194
01:45:46,870 --> 01:45:46,880
um but i i you know the philosophers for
 

6195
01:45:46,880 --> 01:45:48,950
um but i i you know the philosophers for
a long time have talked about uh the

6196
01:45:48,950 --> 01:45:48,960
a long time have talked about uh the
 

6197
01:45:48,960 --> 01:45:50,870
a long time have talked about uh the
possibility that you can

6198
01:45:50,870 --> 01:45:50,880
possibility that you can
 

6199
01:45:50,880 --> 01:45:53,270
possibility that you can
have a zombie intelligence

6200
01:45:53,270 --> 01:45:53,280
have a zombie intelligence
 

6201
01:45:53,280 --> 01:45:55,430
have a zombie intelligence
uh and that there are no feelings there

6202
01:45:55,430 --> 01:45:55,440
uh and that there are no feelings there
 

6203
01:45:55,440 --> 01:45:58,629
uh and that there are no feelings there
but all everything else is the same um

6204
01:45:58,629 --> 01:45:58,639
but all everything else is the same um
 

6205
01:45:58,639 --> 01:46:00,550
but all everything else is the same um
is i mean i have to throw this back to

6206
01:46:00,550 --> 01:46:00,560
is i mean i have to throw this back to
 

6207
01:46:00,560 --> 01:46:02,470
is i mean i have to throw this back to
you really how do you deal with zombie

6208
01:46:02,470 --> 01:46:02,480
you really how do you deal with zombie
 

6209
01:46:02,480 --> 01:46:03,910
you really how do you deal with zombie
intelligence

6210
01:46:03,910 --> 01:46:03,920
intelligence
 

6211
01:46:03,920 --> 01:46:06,229
intelligence
so first of all i can see that from a

6212
01:46:06,229 --> 01:46:06,239
so first of all i can see that from a
 

6213
01:46:06,239 --> 01:46:08,550
so first of all i can see that from a
biologist's perspective

6214
01:46:08,550 --> 01:46:08,560
biologist's perspective
 

6215
01:46:08,560 --> 01:46:10,790
biologist's perspective
you think of all the complexities that

6216
01:46:10,790 --> 01:46:10,800
you think of all the complexities that
 

6217
01:46:10,800 --> 01:46:12,790
you think of all the complexities that
led up to the human being

6218
01:46:12,790 --> 01:46:12,800
led up to the human being
 

6219
01:46:12,800 --> 01:46:14,470
led up to the human being
the entirety of the history of four

6220
01:46:14,470 --> 01:46:14,480
the entirety of the history of four
 

6221
01:46:14,480 --> 01:46:17,510
the entirety of the history of four
billion years that in some deep sense

6222
01:46:17,510 --> 01:46:17,520
billion years that in some deep sense
 

6223
01:46:17,520 --> 01:46:19,270
billion years that in some deep sense
integrated the human being into this

6224
01:46:19,270 --> 01:46:19,280
integrated the human being into this
 

6225
01:46:19,280 --> 01:46:21,270
integrated the human being into this
environment and that

6226
01:46:21,270 --> 01:46:21,280
environment and that
 

6227
01:46:21,280 --> 01:46:23,669
environment and that
dance of the organism and the

6228
01:46:23,669 --> 01:46:23,679
dance of the organism and the
 

6229
01:46:23,679 --> 01:46:24,950
dance of the organism and the
environment

6230
01:46:24,950 --> 01:46:24,960
environment
 

6231
01:46:24,960 --> 01:46:26,870
environment
you could see how emotions arise from

6232
01:46:26,870 --> 01:46:26,880
you could see how emotions arise from
 

6233
01:46:26,880 --> 01:46:29,189
you could see how emotions arise from
that and their emotions are deeply

6234
01:46:29,189 --> 01:46:29,199
that and their emotions are deeply
 

6235
01:46:29,199 --> 01:46:30,950
that and their emotions are deeply
connected and creating a human

6236
01:46:30,950 --> 01:46:30,960
connected and creating a human
 

6237
01:46:30,960 --> 01:46:33,270
connected and creating a human
experience and from that you mix in

6238
01:46:33,270 --> 01:46:33,280
experience and from that you mix in
 

6239
01:46:33,280 --> 01:46:34,870
experience and from that you mix in
consciousness and

6240
01:46:34,870 --> 01:46:34,880
consciousness and
 

6241
01:46:34,880 --> 01:46:38,070
consciousness and
the fullness of it yeah uh but

6242
01:46:38,070 --> 01:46:38,080
the fullness of it yeah uh but
 

6243
01:46:38,080 --> 01:46:40,229
the fullness of it yeah uh but
from a perspective of an intelligent

6244
01:46:40,229 --> 01:46:40,239
from a perspective of an intelligent
 

6245
01:46:40,239 --> 01:46:42,629
from a perspective of an intelligent
organism that's already here

6246
01:46:42,629 --> 01:46:42,639
organism that's already here
 

6247
01:46:42,639 --> 01:46:45,109
organism that's already here
like a baby that learns

6248
01:46:45,109 --> 01:46:45,119
like a baby that learns
 

6249
01:46:45,119 --> 01:46:47,830
like a baby that learns
it doesn't need to learn how to

01:46:47,830 --> 01:46:47,840
it doesn't need to learn how to

01:51:56,709 --> 01:51:56,719
and then it feels sad necessarily

because

it doesn't know what to do

think the only way to find out is to do
it and just build it yeah and leave it

01:52:07,350 --> 01:52:07,360
it and just build it yeah and leave it
 

6555
01:52:07,360 --> 01:52:09,270

the point is the robot will be sitting

there alone having an internal conflict
an existential crisis and that's

an existential crisis and that's
 

6565
01:52:17,280 --> 01:52:19,270
an existential crisis and that's

01:52:24,719 --> 01:52:26,550
don't know but i'd like to throw
something else at you which which

6574
01:52:26,550 --> 01:52:26,560
something else at you which which
 

6575
01:52:26,560 --> 01:52:30,629
something else at you which which
troubles me uh on reading it um

6576
01:52:30,629 --> 01:52:30,639
troubles me uh on reading it um
 

6577
01:52:30,639 --> 01:52:33,910
troubles me uh on reading it um
uh noah harrari's book 21 lessons for

6578
01:52:33,910 --> 01:52:33,920
uh noah harrari's book 21 lessons for
 

6579
01:52:33,920 --> 01:52:35,750
uh noah harrari's book 21 lessons for
the 21st century and he's written about

6580
01:52:35,750 --> 01:52:35,760
the 21st century and he's written about
 

6581
01:52:35,760 --> 01:52:38,310
the 21st century and he's written about
this kind of thing on various occasions

6582
01:52:38,310 --> 01:52:38,320
this kind of thing on various occasions
 

6583
01:52:38,320 --> 01:52:41,430
this kind of thing on various occasions
and he sees biochemistry as an algorithm

6584
01:52:41,430 --> 01:52:41,440
and he sees biochemistry as an algorithm
 

6585
01:52:41,440 --> 01:52:44,870
and he sees biochemistry as an algorithm
and then ai will necessarily be able to

6586
01:52:44,870 --> 01:52:44,880
and then ai will necessarily be able to
 

6587
01:52:44,880 --> 01:52:46,550
and then ai will necessarily be able to
hack that algorithm and do it better

6588
01:52:46,550 --> 01:52:46,560
hack that algorithm and do it better
 

6589
01:52:46,560 --> 01:52:48,629
hack that algorithm and do it better
than humans so there will be a.i better

6590
01:52:48,629 --> 01:52:48,639
than humans so there will be a.i better
 

6591
01:52:48,639 --> 01:52:50,470

01:52:52,239 --> 01:52:53,910
mozart ever called or writing better
than shakespeare ever did and so on

01:52:53,910 --> 01:52:53,920
than shakespeare ever did and so on
 

6597
01:52:53,920 --> 01:52:54,870
than shakespeare ever did and so on
because

6598
01:52:54,870 --> 01:52:54,880
because
 

6599
01:52:54,880 --> 01:52:56,629
because
biochemistry is algorithmic and all you

6600
01:52:56,629 --> 01:52:56,639
biochemistry is algorithmic and all you
 

6601
01:52:56,639 --> 01:52:58,229
biochemistry is algorithmic and all you
need to do is figure out which bits of

6602
01:52:58,229 --> 01:52:58,239
need to do is figure out which bits of
 

6603
01:52:58,239 --> 01:53:00,709
need to do is figure out which bits of
the algorithm to play to make us feel

6604
01:53:00,709 --> 01:53:00,719
the algorithm to play to make us feel
 

6605
01:53:00,719 --> 01:53:03,030
the algorithm to play to make us feel
good or bad or appreciate things

01:53:03,030 --> 01:53:03,040
good or bad or appreciate things
 

6607
01:53:03,040 --> 01:53:05,669
good or bad or appreciate things
and it's a as a biochemist i find that

6608
01:53:05,669 --> 01:53:05,679
and it's a as a biochemist i find that
 

6609
01:53:05,679 --> 01:53:09,589
and it's a as a biochemist i find that
argument

6610
01:53:09,589 --> 01:53:09,599

 

6611
01:53:09,599 --> 01:53:11,910

close to irrefutable and not very

i don't like the sound of it that's just

6616
01:53:15,030 --> 01:53:15,040
i don't like the sound of it that's just
 

6617
01:53:15,040 --> 01:53:16,550
i don't like the sound of it that's just
my reaction as a human being you might

6618
01:53:16,550 --> 01:53:16,560
my reaction as a human being you might
 

6619
01:53:16,560 --> 01:53:17,990
my reaction as a human being you might
like the sound of it because that says

6620
01:53:17,990 --> 01:53:18,000
like the sound of it because that says
 

6621
01:53:18,000 --> 01:53:20,870
like the sound of it because that says
that ai is is capable of the same kind

uh emotional feelings about the world as
 

6627
01:53:24,880 --> 01:53:26,470
uh emotional feelings about the world as

as we are because the whole thing is an

01:53:26,480 --> 01:53:27,750
as we are because the whole thing is an

he then has a peculiar final chapter

6636
01:53:33,430 --> 01:53:33,440
he then has a peculiar final chapter
 

6637
01:53:33,440 --> 01:53:36,070
he then has a peculiar final chapter
where he talks about consciousness in

6638
01:53:36,070 --> 01:53:36,080
where he talks about consciousness in
 

6639
01:53:36,080 --> 01:53:38,470
where he talks about consciousness in
rather separate terms and he's talking

6640
01:53:38,470 --> 01:53:38,480
rather separate terms and he's talking
 

6641
01:53:38,480 --> 01:53:39,990
rather separate terms and he's talking
about meditating and so on and getting

6642
01:53:39,990 --> 01:53:40,000
about meditating and so on and getting
 

6643
01:53:40,000 --> 01:53:41,589
about meditating and so on and getting
in touch with his inner conscious i

6644
01:53:41,589 --> 01:53:41,599
in touch with his inner conscious i
 

6645
01:53:41,599 --> 01:53:43,109
in touch with his inner conscious i
don't meditate i don't know anything

6646
01:53:43,109 --> 01:53:43,119
don't meditate i don't know anything
 

6647
01:53:43,119 --> 01:53:44,470
don't meditate i don't know anything
about that

6648
01:53:44,470 --> 01:53:44,480
about that
 

6649
01:53:44,480 --> 01:53:46,629
about that
but he wrote in very different terms

6650
01:53:46,629 --> 01:53:46,639
but he wrote in very different terms
 

6651
01:53:46,639 --> 01:53:47,990
but he wrote in very different terms
about it

6652
01:53:47,990 --> 01:53:48,000
about it
 

6653
01:53:48,000 --> 01:53:49,990
about it
as if somehow it's a way out of the

6654
01:53:49,990 --> 01:53:50,000
as if somehow it's a way out of the
 

6655
01:53:50,000 --> 01:53:51,430
as if somehow it's a way out of the
algorithm

6656
01:53:51,430 --> 01:53:51,440
algorithm
 

6657
01:53:51,440 --> 01:53:53,350
algorithm
um now

6658
01:53:53,350 --> 01:53:53,360
um now
 

6659
01:53:53,360 --> 01:53:55,189
um now
it seems to me that consciousness in

6660
01:53:55,189 --> 01:53:55,199
it seems to me that consciousness in
 

6661
01:53:55,199 --> 01:53:57,750
it seems to me that consciousness in
that sense is capable of scuppering the

6662
01:53:57,750 --> 01:53:57,760
that sense is capable of scuppering the
 

6663
01:53:57,760 --> 01:54:00,149
that sense is capable of scuppering the
algorithm i think in terms of the

6664
01:54:00,149 --> 01:54:00,159
algorithm i think in terms of the
 

6665
01:54:00,159 --> 01:54:02,310
algorithm i think in terms of the
biochemical feedback loops and so on it

6666
01:54:02,310 --> 01:54:02,320
biochemical feedback loops and so on it
 

6667
01:54:02,320 --> 01:54:04,629
biochemical feedback loops and so on it
is undoubtedly algorithmic

6668
01:54:04,629 --> 01:54:04,639
is undoubtedly algorithmic
 

6669
01:54:04,639 --> 01:54:07,669
is undoubtedly algorithmic
but in terms of what we decide to do

6670
01:54:07,669 --> 01:54:07,679
but in terms of what we decide to do
 

6671
01:54:07,679 --> 01:54:10,149
but in terms of what we decide to do
it can be much more

6672
01:54:10,149 --> 01:54:10,159
it can be much more
 

6673
01:54:10,159 --> 01:54:13,189
it can be much more
um

6674
01:54:13,189 --> 01:54:13,199

 

6675
01:54:13,199 --> 01:54:16,149

based on an emotion we can just think i

6676
01:54:16,149 --> 01:54:16,159
based on an emotion we can just think i
 

6677
01:54:16,159 --> 01:54:18,950
based on an emotion we can just think i
don't care i can't resolve this complex

6678
01:54:18,950 --> 01:54:18,960
don't care i can't resolve this complex
 

6679
01:54:18,960 --> 01:54:20,070
don't care i can't resolve this complex
situation

6680
01:54:20,070 --> 01:54:20,080
situation
 

6681
01:54:20,080 --> 01:54:21,750
situation
i'm going to do that

6682
01:54:21,750 --> 01:54:21,760
i'm going to do that
 

6683
01:54:21,760 --> 01:54:23,750
i'm going to do that
and that can be based on in effect a

6684
01:54:23,750 --> 01:54:23,760
and that can be based on in effect a
 

6685
01:54:23,760 --> 01:54:25,430
and that can be based on in effect a
different currency which is the currency

6686
01:54:25,430 --> 01:54:25,440
different currency which is the currency
 

6687
01:54:25,440 --> 01:54:27,430
different currency which is the currency
of feelings and something where we don't

6688
01:54:27,430 --> 01:54:27,440
of feelings and something where we don't
 

6689
01:54:27,440 --> 01:54:29,910
of feelings and something where we don't
have very much personal control over and

6690
01:54:29,910 --> 01:54:29,920
have very much personal control over and
 

6691
01:54:29,920 --> 01:54:31,910
have very much personal control over and
then it comes back around to to to you

6692
01:54:31,910 --> 01:54:31,920
then it comes back around to to to you
 

6693
01:54:31,920 --> 01:54:34,149
then it comes back around to to to you
and what you what are you trying to get

6694
01:54:34,149 --> 01:54:34,159
and what you what are you trying to get
 

6695
01:54:34,159 --> 01:54:36,870
and what you what are you trying to get
at with ai do we need to have some

6696
01:54:36,870 --> 01:54:36,880
at with ai do we need to have some
 

6697
01:54:36,880 --> 01:54:40,070
at with ai do we need to have some
system which is capable of overriding

6698
01:54:40,070 --> 01:54:40,080
system which is capable of overriding
 

6699
01:54:40,080 --> 01:54:42,550
system which is capable of overriding
a rational decision which cannot be made

6700
01:54:42,550 --> 01:54:42,560
a rational decision which cannot be made
 

6701
01:54:42,560 --> 01:54:43,910
a rational decision which cannot be made
because there's too much conflicting

6702
01:54:43,910 --> 01:54:43,920
because there's too much conflicting
 

6703
01:54:43,920 --> 01:54:44,950
because there's too much conflicting
information

6704
01:54:44,950 --> 01:54:44,960

6705
01:54:44,960 --> 01:54:45,750

effectively an emotional judgmental

effectively an emotional judgmental
 

6709
01:54:47,920 --> 01:54:49,510
effectively an emotional judgmental
decision that just says do this and see

6710
01:54:49,510 --> 01:54:49,520
decision that just says do this and see
 

6711
01:54:49,520 --> 01:54:51,189
decision that just says do this and see
what happens yeah that's what

6712
01:54:51,189 --> 01:54:51,199
what happens yeah that's what
 

6713
01:54:51,199 --> 01:54:53,350
what happens yeah that's what
consciousness is really doing in my view

6714
01:54:53,350 --> 01:54:53,360
consciousness is really doing in my view
 

6715
01:54:53,360 --> 01:54:55,350
consciousness is really doing in my view
yeah and the question is whether it's a

6716
01:54:55,350 --> 01:54:55,360
yeah and the question is whether it's a
 

6717
01:54:55,360 --> 01:54:57,589
yeah and the question is whether it's a
different process or just a higher level

6718
01:54:57,589 --> 01:54:57,599
different process or just a higher level
 

6719
01:54:57,599 --> 01:54:58,550
different process or just a higher level
process

6720
01:54:58,550 --> 01:54:58,560
process
 

6721
01:54:58,560 --> 01:55:00,790
process
um i might you know

6722
01:55:00,790 --> 01:55:00,800
um i might you know
 

6723
01:55:00,800 --> 01:55:02,470
um i might you know
the idea that biochemistry is an

6724
01:55:02,470 --> 01:55:02,480
the idea that biochemistry is an
 

6725
01:55:02,480 --> 01:55:04,229
the idea that biochemistry is an
algorithm

6726
01:55:04,229 --> 01:55:04,239
algorithm
 

6727
01:55:04,239 --> 01:55:07,350
algorithm
is uh to me an over simplistic view

6728
01:55:07,350 --> 01:55:07,360
is uh to me an over simplistic view
 

6729
01:55:07,360 --> 01:55:11,350
is uh to me an over simplistic view
there's a lot of things that

6730
01:55:11,350 --> 01:55:11,360

 

6731
01:55:11,360 --> 01:55:13,189

the moment you say it

6732
01:55:13,189 --> 01:55:13,199
the moment you say it
 

6733
01:55:13,199 --> 01:55:16,870
the moment you say it

6825
01:56:48,560 --> 01:56:49,669
the toaster is making you happy yes
it's not about whether you make the

01:56:57,040 --> 01:56:58,470
it has to be the toaster has to be able
to leave me happy yeah because the

6836
01:56:58,470 --> 01:56:58,480
to leave me happy yeah because the
 

6837
01:56:58,480 --> 01:57:00,229
to leave me happy yeah because the
toaster is the ai in this case is a very

01:57:00,229 --> 01:57:00,239
toaster is the ai in this case is a very
 

6839
01:57:00,239 --> 01:57:01,750
toaster is the ai in this case is a very
interesting the toaster has to be able

interesting the toaster has to be able
 

6841
01:57:01,760 --> 01:57:04,790
interesting the toaster has to be able
to be unhappy and leave me

6842
01:57:04,790 --> 01:57:04,800
to be unhappy and leave me
 

6843
01:57:04,800 --> 01:57:06,229
to be unhappy and leave me
that's essential

01:57:06,229 --> 01:57:06,239
that's essential
 

6845
01:57:06,239 --> 01:57:08,229
that's essential
yeah that's essential for my being able

yeah that's essential for my being able
 

6847
01:57:08,239 --> 01:57:10,390
yeah that's essential for my being able
to miss the toaster if the toaster is

has to have internal conflict you write

6860
01:57:25,109 --> 01:57:25,119
has to have internal conflict you write
 

6861
01:57:25,119 --> 01:57:27,669
has to have internal conflict you write
about life and death it has to be able

6862
01:57:27,669 --> 01:57:27,679
about life and death it has to be able
 

6863
01:57:27,679 --> 01:57:30,790
about life and death it has to be able
to be conscious of its mortality

6864
01:57:30,790 --> 01:57:30,800
to be conscious of its mortality
 

6865
01:57:30,800 --> 01:57:33,589
to be conscious of its mortality
and the finiteness of its existence

6866
01:57:33,589 --> 01:57:33,599
and the finiteness of its existence
 

6867
01:57:33,599 --> 01:57:35,830
and the finiteness of its existence
and that life is for temporary and

6868
01:57:35,830 --> 01:57:35,840
and that life is for temporary and
 

6869
01:57:35,840 --> 01:57:37,910
and that life is for temporary and
therefore it needs to be more selective

6870
01:57:37,910 --> 01:57:37,920
therefore it needs to be more selective
 

6871
01:57:37,920 --> 01:57:38,790
therefore it needs to be more selective
what are those

6872
01:57:38,790 --> 01:57:38,800
what are those

01:57:38,800 --> 01:57:40,950
what are those
hangs out moving moments in the movies

6874
01:57:40,950 --> 01:57:40,960

from when i was a boy was the the

6876
01:57:42,629 --> 01:57:42,639
from when i was a boy was the the
 

6877
01:57:42,639 --> 01:57:46,470
from when i was a boy was the the
unplugging of hal in 2001 where

6878
01:57:46,470 --> 01:57:46,480
unplugging of hal in 2001 where
 

6879
01:57:46,480 --> 01:57:48,470
unplugging of hal in 2001 where
that was the death of a sentient being

6880
01:57:48,470 --> 01:57:48,480
that was the death of a sentient being
 

6881
01:57:48,480 --> 01:57:49,270
that was the death of a sentient being
and

6882
01:57:49,270 --> 01:57:49,280
and
 

6883
01:57:49,280 --> 01:57:50,870
and
hal knew it

6884
01:57:50,870 --> 01:57:50,880
hal knew it
 

6885
01:57:50,880 --> 01:57:52,709

01:58:03,910 --> 01:58:03,920
whether
 

6899
01:58:03,920 --> 01:58:05,750
whether
it would be back like biological

6900
01:58:05,750 --> 01:58:05,760
it would be back like biological
 

6901
01:58:05,760 --> 01:58:07,669
it would be back like biological
consciousness i just don't know and if

6902
01:58:07,669 --> 01:58:07,679
consciousness i just don't know and if
 

6903
01:58:07,679 --> 01:58:09,589
consciousness i just don't know and if
you're thinking about how do we bring

6904
01:58:09,589 --> 01:58:09,599
you're thinking about how do we bring
 

6905
01:58:09,599 --> 01:58:11,270
you're thinking about how do we bring
together i mean obviously we're going to

6906
01:58:11,270 --> 01:58:11,280
together i mean obviously we're going to
 

6907
01:58:11,280 --> 01:58:12,790
together i mean obviously we're going to
interact

6908
01:58:12,790 --> 01:58:12,800
interact
 

6909
01:58:12,800 --> 01:58:16,149
interact
um more closely with with ai

6910
01:58:16,149 --> 01:58:16,159
um more closely with with ai
 

6911
01:58:16,159 --> 01:58:17,189
um more closely with with ai
but

6912
01:58:17,189 --> 01:58:17,199
but
 

6913
01:58:17,199 --> 01:58:18,550
but
are we really

6914
01:58:18,550 --> 01:58:18,560
are we really
 

6915
01:58:18,560 --> 01:58:21,510
are we really
is is a is a dog really like a toaster

6916
01:58:21,510 --> 01:58:21,520
is is a is a dog really like a toaster
 

6917
01:58:21,520 --> 01:58:24,790
is is a is a dog really like a toaster
or is there really some kind of

6918
01:58:24,790 --> 01:58:24,800
or is there really some kind of
 

6919
01:58:24,800 --> 01:58:26,629
or is there really some kind of
difference there you were talking ab you

6920
01:58:26,629 --> 01:58:26,639
difference there you were talking ab you
 

6921
01:58:26,639 --> 01:58:29,589
difference there you were talking ab you
know biochemistry is algorithmic uh but

6922
01:58:29,589 --> 01:58:29,599
know biochemistry is algorithmic uh but
 

6923
01:58:29,599 --> 01:58:31,669
know biochemistry is algorithmic uh but
it's not single algorithm and it's very

6924
01:58:31,669 --> 01:58:31,679
it's not single algorithm and it's very
 

6925
01:58:31,679 --> 01:58:33,510
it's not single algorithm and it's very
complex of course it is so it may be

6926
01:58:33,510 --> 01:58:33,520
complex of course it is so it may be
 

6927
01:58:33,520 --> 01:58:35,669
complex of course it is so it may be
that there's there are again conflicts

6928
01:58:35,669 --> 01:58:35,679
that there's there are again conflicts
 

6929
01:58:35,679 --> 01:58:37,270
that there's there are again conflicts
in the circuits of biochemistry but i

6930
01:58:37,270 --> 01:58:37,280
in the circuits of biochemistry but i
 

6931
01:58:37,280 --> 01:58:39,030
in the circuits of biochemistry but i
have a feeling

6932
01:58:39,030 --> 01:58:39,040
have a feeling
 

6933
01:58:39,040 --> 01:58:41,589
have a feeling
that the level of complexity of

6934
01:58:41,589 --> 01:58:41,599
that the level of complexity of
 

6935
01:58:41,599 --> 01:58:43,270
that the level of complexity of
the total biochemical system at the

6936
01:58:43,270 --> 01:58:43,280
the total biochemical system at the
 

6937
01:58:43,280 --> 01:58:45,430
the total biochemical system at the
level of a single cell is less complex

6938
01:58:45,430 --> 01:58:45,440
level of a single cell is less complex
 

6939
01:58:45,440 --> 01:58:47,430
level of a single cell is less complex
than the the level of neural networking

6940
01:58:47,430 --> 01:58:47,440
than the the level of neural networking
 

6941
01:58:47,440 --> 01:58:52,229
than the the level of neural networking
in the human brain or in an ai

6942
01:58:52,229 --> 01:58:52,239

 

6943
01:58:52,239 --> 01:58:54,790

well i guess i assumed that we were

6944
01:58:54,790 --> 01:58:54,800
well i guess i assumed that we were
 

6945
01:58:54,800 --> 01:58:56,470
well i guess i assumed that we were
including the brain in the biochemistry

6946
01:58:56,470 --> 01:58:56,480
including the brain in the biochemistry
 

6947
01:58:56,480 --> 01:58:57,589
including the brain in the biochemistry
algorithm

6948
01:58:57,589 --> 01:58:57,599
algorithm
 

6949
01:58:57,599 --> 01:58:59,270
algorithm
because you have to

6950
01:58:59,270 --> 01:58:59,280
because you have to
 

6951
01:58:59,280 --> 01:59:01,189
because you have to
uh i would see that as a higher level of

6952
01:59:01,189 --> 01:59:01,199
uh i would see that as a higher level of
 

6953
01:59:01,199 --> 01:59:02,950
uh i would see that as a higher level of
organization of neural networks they're

6954
01:59:02,950 --> 01:59:02,960
organization of neural networks they're
 

6955
01:59:02,960 --> 01:59:04,790
organization of neural networks they're
all using the same biochemical wiring

6956
01:59:04,790 --> 01:59:04,800
all using the same biochemical wiring
 

6957
01:59:04,800 --> 01:59:06,229
all using the same biochemical wiring
within themselves

6958
01:59:06,229 --> 01:59:06,239
within themselves
 

6959
01:59:06,239 --> 01:59:08,310
within themselves
yeah but the human brain is not just

6960
01:59:08,310 --> 01:59:08,320
yeah but the human brain is not just
 

6961
01:59:08,320 --> 01:59:09,589
yeah but the human brain is not just
neurons

6962
01:59:09,589 --> 01:59:09,599
neurons
 

6963
01:59:09,599 --> 01:59:11,910
neurons
it's the immune system it's it's the

6964
01:59:11,910 --> 01:59:11,920
it's the immune system it's it's the
 

6965
01:59:11,920 --> 01:59:13,830
it's the immune system it's it's the
whole package

6966
01:59:13,830 --> 01:59:13,840
whole package
 

6967
01:59:13,840 --> 01:59:16,149
whole package
i mean to have a biochemical algorithm

6968
01:59:16,149 --> 01:59:16,159
i mean to have a biochemical algorithm
 

6969
01:59:16,159 --> 01:59:17,910
i mean to have a biochemical algorithm
that runs a

6970
01:59:17,910 --> 01:59:17,920
that runs a
 

6971
01:59:17,920 --> 01:59:19,990
that runs a
uh intelligent biological system you

6972
01:59:19,990 --> 01:59:20,000
uh intelligent biological system you
 

6973
01:59:20,000 --> 01:59:21,669
uh intelligent biological system you
have to include the whole damn thing and

6974
01:59:21,669 --> 01:59:21,679
have to include the whole damn thing and
 

6975
01:59:21,679 --> 01:59:23,510
have to include the whole damn thing and
it's pretty fascinating it comes from

6976
01:59:23,510 --> 01:59:23,520
it's pretty fascinating it comes from
 

6977
01:59:23,520 --> 01:59:24,310
it's pretty fascinating it comes from
like

6978
01:59:24,310 --> 01:59:24,320
like
 

6979
01:59:24,320 --> 01:59:25,750
like
from an embryo

6980
01:59:25,750 --> 01:59:25,760
from an embryo
 

6981
01:59:25,760 --> 01:59:28,950
from an embryo
like the whole i mean oh boy

6982
01:59:28,950 --> 01:59:28,960
like the whole i mean oh boy
 

6983
01:59:28,960 --> 01:59:31,189
like the whole i mean oh boy
i mean if you can um

6984
01:59:31,189 --> 01:59:31,199
i mean if you can um
 

6985
01:59:31,199 --> 01:59:33,030
i mean if you can um
what is a human being

6986
01:59:33,030 --> 01:59:33,040
what is a human being
 

6987
01:59:33,040 --> 01:59:34,870
what is a human being
because it's but if you look just some

6988
01:59:34,870 --> 01:59:34,880
because it's but if you look just some
 

6989
01:59:34,880 --> 01:59:37,510
because it's but if you look just some
code and then you build and then that so

6990
01:59:37,510 --> 01:59:37,520
code and then you build and then that so
 

6991
01:59:37,520 --> 01:59:39,510
code and then you build and then that so
it's dna doesn't just tell you what to

6992
01:59:39,510 --> 01:59:39,520
it's dna doesn't just tell you what to
 

6993
01:59:39,520 --> 01:59:41,589
it's dna doesn't just tell you what to
build but how to build it

6994
01:59:41,589 --> 01:59:41,599
build but how to build it
 

6995
01:59:41,599 --> 01:59:42,870
build but how to build it
is it

6996
01:59:42,870 --> 01:59:42,880
is it
 

6997
01:59:42,880 --> 01:59:44,790
is it
i mean the thing is impressive and the

6998
01:59:44,790 --> 01:59:44,800
i mean the thing is impressive and the
 

6999
01:59:44,800 --> 01:59:47,350
i mean the thing is impressive and the
question is how

7000
01:59:47,350 --> 01:59:47,360
question is how
 

7001
01:59:47,360 --> 01:59:48,550
question is how
uh

7002
01:59:48,550 --> 01:59:48,560
uh
 

7003
01:59:48,560 --> 01:59:50,470
uh
difficult is it to reverse engineer the

7004
01:59:50,470 --> 01:59:50,480
difficult is it to reverse engineer the
 

7005
01:59:50,480 --> 01:59:52,790
difficult is it to reverse engineer the
whole shebang

7006
01:59:52,790 --> 01:59:52,800
whole shebang
 

7007
01:59:52,800 --> 01:59:59,510
whole shebang
very difficult i i would say it's

7008
01:59:59,510 --> 01:59:59,520

 

7009
01:59:59,520 --> 02:00:01,990

don't want to say impossible but

7010
02:00:01,990 --> 02:00:02,000
don't want to say impossible but
 

7011
02:00:02,000 --> 02:00:03,109
don't want to say impossible but
it is

7012
02:00:03,109 --> 02:00:03,119
it is
 

7013
02:00:03,119 --> 02:00:05,189
it is
like it's much easier to build a human

7014
02:00:05,189 --> 02:00:05,199
like it's much easier to build a human
 

7015
02:00:05,199 --> 02:00:07,109
like it's much easier to build a human
than to reverse engineer

7016
02:00:07,109 --> 02:00:07,119
than to reverse engineer
 

7017
02:00:07,119 --> 02:00:07,830
than to reverse engineer
uh

7018
02:00:07,830 --> 02:00:07,840
uh
 

7019
02:00:07,840 --> 02:00:09,669
uh
to build like a fake human

7020
02:00:09,669 --> 02:00:09,679
to build like a fake human
 

7021
02:00:09,679 --> 02:00:11,510
to build like a fake human
human-like thing

7022
02:00:11,510 --> 02:00:11,520
human-like thing
 

7023
02:00:11,520 --> 02:00:13,510
human-like thing
than to reverse engineer the entirety of

7024
02:00:13,510 --> 02:00:13,520
than to reverse engineer the entirety of
 

7025
02:00:13,520 --> 02:00:15,510
than to reverse engineer the entirety of
the process the evolution of

7026
02:00:15,510 --> 02:00:15,520
the process the evolution of
 

7027
02:00:15,520 --> 02:00:18,470
the process the evolution of
her i'm not sure if we are capable of

7028
02:00:18,470 --> 02:00:18,480
her i'm not sure if we are capable of
 

7029
02:00:18,480 --> 02:00:21,030
her i'm not sure if we are capable of
reverse engineering the whole thing yeah

7030
02:00:21,030 --> 02:00:21,040
reverse engineering the whole thing yeah
 

7031
02:00:21,040 --> 02:00:23,030
reverse engineering the whole thing yeah
if our if the human mind is capable of

7032
02:00:23,030 --> 02:00:23,040
if our if the human mind is capable of
 

7033
02:00:23,040 --> 02:00:24,470
if our if the human mind is capable of
doing that i mean

7034
02:00:24,470 --> 02:00:24,480
doing that i mean
 

7035
02:00:24,480 --> 02:00:25,990
doing that i mean
i wouldn't be a biologist if i wasn't

7036
02:00:25,990 --> 02:00:26,000
i wouldn't be a biologist if i wasn't
 

7037
02:00:26,000 --> 02:00:29,030
i wouldn't be a biologist if i wasn't
trying yeah um but

7038
02:00:29,030 --> 02:00:29,040
trying yeah um but
 

7039
02:00:29,040 --> 02:00:30,629
trying yeah um but
i know i can't understand the whole

7040
02:00:30,629 --> 02:00:30,639
i know i can't understand the whole
 

7041
02:00:30,639 --> 02:00:31,910
i know i can't understand the whole
problem i'm just trying to understand

7042
02:00:31,910 --> 02:00:31,920
problem i'm just trying to understand
 

7043
02:00:31,920 --> 02:00:35,510
problem i'm just trying to understand
the rudimentary outlines of the problem

7044
02:00:35,510 --> 02:00:35,520
the rudimentary outlines of the problem
 

7045
02:00:35,520 --> 02:00:37,350
the rudimentary outlines of the problem
there's another aspect though you're

7046
02:00:37,350 --> 02:00:37,360
there's another aspect though you're
 

7047
02:00:37,360 --> 02:00:38,790
there's another aspect though you're
talking about developing from a single

7048
02:00:38,790 --> 02:00:38,800
talking about developing from a single
 

7049
02:00:38,800 --> 02:00:41,350
talking about developing from a single
cell to a to a to the human mind and all

7050
02:00:41,350 --> 02:00:41,360
cell to a to a to the human mind and all
 

7051
02:00:41,360 --> 02:00:42,390

the

7052
02:00:42,390 --> 02:00:42,400
the

um

7058
02:00:48,790 --> 02:00:48,800
um
 

7059
02:00:48,800 --> 02:00:50,390
um
this is something

7060
02:00:50,390 --> 02:00:50,400
this is something
 

7061
02:00:50,400 --> 02:00:53,430
this is something
that you'll talk about i imagine um with

a lot of biologists and it should not be

electricity in biology really works and

7140
02:02:10,229 --> 02:02:10,239
electricity in biology really works and
 

7141
02:02:10,239 --> 02:02:11,669
electricity in biology really works and
and if it is

7142
02:02:11,669 --> 02:02:11,679
and if it is
 

7143
02:02:11,679 --> 02:02:12,870
and if it is

that's the stamin in the meantime we

7148
02:02:17,830 --> 02:02:17,840
that's the stamin in the meantime we
 

7149
02:02:17,840 --> 02:02:19,910
that's the stamin in the meantime we
have to try but but i think that's where

7150
02:02:19,910 --> 02:02:19,920
have to try but but i think that's where
 

7151
02:02:19,920 --> 02:02:22,470
have to try but but i think that's where
the answer lies

7152
02:02:22,470 --> 02:02:22,480
the answer lies
 

7153
02:02:22,480 --> 02:02:25,510
the answer lies
so you think uh it's possible that the

02:02:25,510 --> 02:02:25,520
so you think uh it's possible that the

02:03:33,189 --> 02:03:33,199
you look at the the structure of the
 

7225
02:03:33,199 --> 02:03:35,189
you look at the the structure of the
mitochondrial membranes

7226

mitochondrial membranes
 

7227
02:03:35,199 --> 02:03:37,910

in the brains of you know simple things
 

7229
02:03:37,920 --> 02:03:40,629
in the brains of you know simple things
like drosophila uh the fruit fly and

like drosophila uh the fruit fly and
 

7231
02:03:40,639 --> 02:03:42,470
like drosophila uh the fruit fly and
they have amazing structures you can see

they have amazing structures you can see
 

7233
02:03:42,480 --> 02:03:44,390
they have amazing structures you can see
lots of little rectangular things all

to who do work on it say amazing things
 

7267
02:04:14,480 --> 02:04:16,629
to who do work on it say amazing things
can happen and that you know a bit of a

02:04:16,629 --> 02:04:16,639
can happen and that you know a bit of a
 

7269

even memories of its former brain
again i i have a feeling that until we

7276
02:04:26,629 --> 02:04:26,639
again i i have a feeling that until we
 

7277
02:04:26,639 --> 02:04:29,030
again i i have a feeling that until we
understand how to control the electrical

fields that that control development
 

7281
02:04:31,040 --> 02:04:32,470
fields that that control development
we're not going to understand how to

we're not going to understand how to
 

7283
02:04:32,480 --> 02:04:34,629
we're not going to understand how to
turn an organoid into a real functional

but how do to get that understanding

7288
02:04:38,470 --> 02:04:38,480
but how do to get that understanding
 

7289
02:04:38,480 --> 02:04:40,229
but how do to get that understanding
it's so

7290
02:04:40,229 --> 02:04:40,239
it's so
 

7291
02:04:40,239 --> 02:04:42,149
it's so
it's so incredibly difficult i mean you

7292
02:04:42,149 --> 02:04:42,159
it's so incredibly difficult i mean you
 

7293
02:04:42,159 --> 02:04:43,270
it's so incredibly difficult i mean you
would have to

7294
02:04:43,270 --> 02:04:43,280
would have to
 

7295
02:04:43,280 --> 02:04:44,870
would have to
i mean one promising direction i'd love

7296
02:04:44,870 --> 02:04:44,880
i mean one promising direction i'd love
 

7297
02:04:44,880 --> 02:04:46,870
i mean one promising direction i'd love
to get your opinion on this um i don't

7298
02:04:46,870 --> 02:04:46,880
to get your opinion on this um i don't
 

7299
02:04:46,880 --> 02:04:48,229
to get your opinion on this um i don't
know if you're familiar with the work of

02:04:48,229 --> 02:04:48,239
know if you're familiar with the work of
 

7301
02:04:48,239 --> 02:04:50,390
know if you're familiar with the work of
deep mind and alpha fold with protein

deep mind and alpha fold with protein
 

7303
02:04:50,400 --> 02:04:52,790
deep mind and alpha fold with protein
folding and so on do you think it's

7304
02:04:52,790 --> 02:04:52,800
folding and so on do you think it's
 

7305
02:04:52,800 --> 02:04:53,910
folding and so on do you think it's
possible

7306
02:04:53,910 --> 02:04:53,920
possible
 

7307
02:04:53,920 --> 02:04:56,310
possible
that that will give us some

7308
02:04:56,310 --> 02:04:56,320
that that will give us some
 

7309
02:04:56,320 --> 02:04:58,950
that that will give us some

basically simulate
 

7313
02:05:01,760 --> 02:05:04,870
basically simulate
and model the behavior of

and model the behavior of
 

7315
02:05:04,880 --> 02:05:07,109
and model the behavior of

trivial biological systems
 

7317
02:05:07,119 --> 02:05:09,109
trivial biological systems
as they become complex biological

i'm sure it will
 

7323
02:05:12,719 --> 02:05:14,629
i'm sure it will
the interesting thing to me about

7324
02:05:14,629 --> 02:05:14,639
the interesting thing to me about
 

7325
02:05:14,639 --> 02:05:16,310
the interesting thing to me about
protein folding

7326
02:05:16,310 --> 02:05:16,320
protein folding
 

7327
02:05:16,320 --> 02:05:17,669
protein folding
is that

7328
02:05:17,669 --> 02:05:17,679
is that
 

7329
02:05:17,679 --> 02:05:19,990
is that
for a long time my understanding is not

7330
02:05:19,990 --> 02:05:20,000
for a long time my understanding is not
 

7331
02:05:20,000 --> 02:05:21,270
for a long time my understanding is not
what i work on so i may have got this

7332
02:05:21,270 --> 02:05:21,280
what i work on so i may have got this
 

7333
02:05:21,280 --> 02:05:22,790
what i work on so i may have got this
wrong but my understanding is that you

7334
02:05:22,790 --> 02:05:22,800
wrong but my understanding is that you
 

7335
02:05:22,800 --> 02:05:24,550
wrong but my understanding is that you
you take the sequence the sequence of a

7336
02:05:24,550 --> 02:05:24,560
you take the sequence the sequence of a
 

7337
02:05:24,560 --> 02:05:25,589
you take the sequence the sequence of a
protein

7338
02:05:25,589 --> 02:05:25,599
protein
 

7339
02:05:25,599 --> 02:05:29,030
protein
and you try to fold it um in and there

7340
02:05:29,030 --> 02:05:29,040
and you try to fold it um in and there
 

7341
02:05:29,040 --> 02:05:30,870
and you try to fold it um in and there
are multiple ways in which you can fold

7342
02:05:30,870 --> 02:05:30,880
are multiple ways in which you can fold
 

7343
02:05:30,880 --> 02:05:32,390
are multiple ways in which you can fold
and to come up with the correct

7344
02:05:32,390 --> 02:05:32,400
and to come up with the correct
 

7345
02:05:32,400 --> 02:05:34,229
and to come up with the correct
conformation is not a very easy thing

7346
02:05:34,229 --> 02:05:34,239
conformation is not a very easy thing
 

7347
02:05:34,239 --> 02:05:35,350
conformation is not a very easy thing
because you're doing it from first

7348
02:05:35,350 --> 02:05:35,360
because you're doing it from first
 

7349
02:05:35,360 --> 02:05:37,270
because you're doing it from first
principles from a string of letters

7350
02:05:37,270 --> 02:05:37,280
principles from a string of letters
 

7351
02:05:37,280 --> 02:05:39,669
principles from a string of letters
which specify the string of amino acids

7352
02:05:39,669 --> 02:05:39,679
which specify the string of amino acids
 

7353
02:05:39,679 --> 02:05:42,149
which specify the string of amino acids
but what actually happens

7354
02:05:42,149 --> 02:05:42,159
but what actually happens
 

7355
02:05:42,159 --> 02:05:44,310
but what actually happens
is when a protein is coming out of a

7356
02:05:44,310 --> 02:05:44,320
is when a protein is coming out of a
 

7357
02:05:44,320 --> 02:05:45,589
is when a protein is coming out of a
ribosome

7358
02:05:45,589 --> 02:05:45,599
ribosome
 

7359
02:05:45,599 --> 02:05:47,910
ribosome
it's coming out of a charged tunnel and

7360
02:05:47,910 --> 02:05:47,920
it's coming out of a charged tunnel and
 

7361
02:05:47,920 --> 02:05:49,510
it's coming out of a charged tunnel and
it's in a very specific environment

7362
02:05:49,510 --> 02:05:49,520
it's in a very specific environment
 

7363
02:05:49,520 --> 02:05:51,030
it's in a very specific environment
which is going to force this to go there

7364
02:05:51,030 --> 02:05:51,040
which is going to force this to go there
 

7365
02:05:51,040 --> 02:05:52,390
which is going to force this to go there
now and then this one to go there and

7366
02:05:52,390 --> 02:05:52,400
now and then this one to go there and
 

7367
02:05:52,400 --> 02:05:53,750
now and then this one to go there and
this one to come like and so you're

7368
02:05:53,750 --> 02:05:53,760
this one to come like and so you're
 

7369
02:05:53,760 --> 02:05:55,910
this one to come like and so you're
forcing a specific conformational set of

7370
02:05:55,910 --> 02:05:55,920
forcing a specific conformational set of
 

7371
02:05:55,920 --> 02:05:57,350
forcing a specific conformational set of
changes onto it as it comes out of the

7372
02:05:57,350 --> 02:05:57,360
changes onto it as it comes out of the
 

7373
02:05:57,360 --> 02:05:59,510
changes onto it as it comes out of the
ribosome so by the time it's fully

7374
02:05:59,510 --> 02:05:59,520
ribosome so by the time it's fully
 

7375
02:05:59,520 --> 02:06:01,830
ribosome so by the time it's fully
emerged it's already got its shape and

7376
02:06:01,830 --> 02:06:01,840
emerged it's already got its shape and
 

7377
02:06:01,840 --> 02:06:04,310
emerged it's already got its shape and
that shape depended on

7378
02:06:04,310 --> 02:06:04,320
that shape depended on
 

7379
02:06:04,320 --> 02:06:06,550
that shape depended on
on on on the immediate environment that

7380
02:06:06,550 --> 02:06:06,560
on on on the immediate environment that
 

7381
02:06:06,560 --> 02:06:09,430
on on on the immediate environment that
it was emerging into one letter as one

7382
02:06:09,430 --> 02:06:09,440
it was emerging into one letter as one
 

7383
02:06:09,440 --> 02:06:11,750
it was emerging into one letter as one
one one amino acid at a time

7384
02:06:11,750 --> 02:06:11,760
one one amino acid at a time
 

7385
02:06:11,760 --> 02:06:14,790
one one amino acid at a time
and i don't think that the field

7386
02:06:14,790 --> 02:06:14,800
and i don't think that the field
 

7387
02:06:14,800 --> 02:06:16,790
and i don't think that the field
was looking at it that way

7388
02:06:16,790 --> 02:06:16,800
was looking at it that way
 

7389
02:06:16,800 --> 02:06:18,790
was looking at it that way
and this is if if that's correct then

7390
02:06:18,790 --> 02:06:18,800
and this is if if that's correct then
 

7391
02:06:18,800 --> 02:06:20,390
and this is if if that's correct then
that's very characteristic of science

7392
02:06:20,390 --> 02:06:20,400
that's very characteristic of science
 

7393
02:06:20,400 --> 02:06:22,390
that's very characteristic of science
which is to say it asks very often the

7394
02:06:22,390 --> 02:06:22,400
which is to say it asks very often the
 

7395
02:06:22,400 --> 02:06:23,750
which is to say it asks very often the
wrong question and then does really

7396
02:06:23,750 --> 02:06:23,760
wrong question and then does really
 

7397
02:06:23,760 --> 02:06:25,910
wrong question and then does really
amazingly sophisticated analyses on

7398
02:06:25,910 --> 02:06:25,920
amazingly sophisticated analyses on
 

7399
02:06:25,920 --> 02:06:27,109
amazingly sophisticated analyses on
something having never thought to

02:06:27,109 --> 02:06:27,119
something having never thought to
 

7401
02:06:27,119 --> 02:06:28,709
something having never thought to
actually think well what is biology

7402
02:06:28,709 --> 02:06:28,719
actually think well what is biology

02:06:28,719 --> 02:06:30,709
actually think well what is biology
doing in biology is giving you a charged

answer that was like that i've got
 

7415
02:06:40,320 --> 02:06:42,470

02:06:42,480 --> 02:06:44,390
absolutely no idea it bought to be
possible to deduce that

7418
02:06:44,390 --> 02:06:44,400
possible to deduce that
 

7419
02:06:44,400 --> 02:06:46,629
possible to deduce that
from the shapes of proteins it would

7420
02:06:46,629 --> 02:06:46,639
from the shapes of proteins it would
 

7421
02:06:46,639 --> 02:06:49,030
from the shapes of proteins it would
require much greater

7422
02:06:49,030 --> 02:06:49,040
require much greater
 

7423
02:06:49,040 --> 02:06:50,310
require much greater
much greater

7424
02:06:50,310 --> 02:06:50,320
much greater
 

7425
02:06:50,320 --> 02:06:52,629
much greater
skill than the human mind has

skill than the human mind has
 

7427
02:06:52,639 --> 02:06:54,310
skill than the human mind has
but the human mind is capable of saying

02:06:54,310 --> 02:06:54,320
but the human mind is capable of saying
 

7429
02:06:54,320 --> 02:06:55,990
but the human mind is capable of saying
well hang on let's look at this exit

7430
02:06:55,990 --> 02:06:56,000
well hang on let's look at this exit
 

7431
02:06:56,000 --> 02:06:57,510
well hang on let's look at this exit
tunnel and try and work out what shape

7432
02:06:57,510 --> 02:06:57,520
tunnel and try and work out what shape
 

7433
02:06:57,520 --> 02:06:59,030
tunnel and try and work out what shape
is this protein going to take well they

7434
02:06:59,030 --> 02:06:59,040
is this protein going to take well they
 

7435
02:06:59,040 --> 02:07:00,390
is this protein going to take well they
can figure that out that's really

7436
02:07:00,390 --> 02:07:00,400
can figure that out that's really
 

7437
02:07:00,400 --> 02:07:01,669
can figure that out that's really
interesting about the exit tunnel but

7438
02:07:01,669 --> 02:07:01,679
interesting about the exit tunnel but
 

7439
02:07:01,679 --> 02:07:04,310
interesting about the exit tunnel but
like sometimes we get lucky and

7440
02:07:04,310 --> 02:07:04,320
like sometimes we get lucky and
 

7441
02:07:04,320 --> 02:07:07,030
like sometimes we get lucky and
our like just second science

7442
02:07:07,030 --> 02:07:07,040
our like just second science
 

7443
02:07:07,040 --> 02:07:10,069
our like just second science
the simplified view or the static view

7444
02:07:10,069 --> 02:07:10,079
the simplified view or the static view
 

7445
02:07:10,079 --> 02:07:11,910
the simplified view or the static view
uh will actually solve the problem for

7446
02:07:11,910 --> 02:07:11,920
uh will actually solve the problem for
 

7447
02:07:11,920 --> 02:07:14,310
uh will actually solve the problem for
us so in this case it's very possible

7448
02:07:14,310 --> 02:07:14,320
us so in this case it's very possible
 

7449
02:07:14,320 --> 02:07:16,390
us so in this case it's very possible
that the sequence of letters has a

7450
02:07:16,390 --> 02:07:16,400
that the sequence of letters has a
 

7451
02:07:16,400 --> 02:07:18,790
that the sequence of letters has a
unique mapping to our structure without

7452
02:07:18,790 --> 02:07:18,800
unique mapping to our structure without
 

7453
02:07:18,800 --> 02:07:20,149
unique mapping to our structure without
considering how

7454
02:07:20,149 --> 02:07:20,159
considering how
 

7455
02:07:20,159 --> 02:07:22,870
considering how
it unraveled so without considering the

7456
02:07:22,870 --> 02:07:22,880
it unraveled so without considering the
 

7457
02:07:22,880 --> 02:07:25,589
it unraveled so without considering the
tunnel and so and that seems to be the

7458
02:07:25,589 --> 02:07:25,599
tunnel and so and that seems to be the
 

7459
02:07:25,599 --> 02:07:26,390
tunnel and so and that seems to be the
case

7460
02:07:26,390 --> 02:07:26,400
case
 

7461
02:07:26,400 --> 02:07:28,390
case
in this situation with the the cool

7462
02:07:28,390 --> 02:07:28,400
in this situation with the the cool
 

7463
02:07:28,400 --> 02:07:30,310
in this situation with the the cool
thing about proteins all the different

7464
02:07:30,310 --> 02:07:30,320
thing about proteins all the different
 

7465
02:07:30,320 --> 02:07:31,669
thing about proteins all the different
shapes that can possibly take it

7466
02:07:31,669 --> 02:07:31,679
shapes that can possibly take it
 

7467
02:07:31,679 --> 02:07:33,350
shapes that can possibly take it
actually seems to take

7468
02:07:33,350 --> 02:07:33,360
actually seems to take
 

7469
02:07:33,360 --> 02:07:35,589
actually seems to take
very specific unique shapes given the

7470
02:07:35,589 --> 02:07:35,599
very specific unique shapes given the
 

7471
02:07:35,599 --> 02:07:37,910
very specific unique shapes given the
sequence that's forced on you by an exit

7472
02:07:37,910 --> 02:07:37,920
sequence that's forced on you by an exit
 

7473
02:07:37,920 --> 02:07:39,510
sequence that's forced on you by an exit
tunnel so the problem is actually much

7474
02:07:39,510 --> 02:07:39,520
tunnel so the problem is actually much
 

7475
02:07:39,520 --> 02:07:40,950
tunnel so the problem is actually much
simpler than you thought and then

7476
02:07:40,950 --> 02:07:40,960
simpler than you thought and then
 

7477
02:07:40,960 --> 02:07:42,950
simpler than you thought and then
there's a whole army of

7478
02:07:42,950 --> 02:07:42,960
there's a whole army of
 

7479
02:07:42,960 --> 02:07:44,870
there's a whole army of
of uh proteins that

7480
02:07:44,870 --> 02:07:44,880
of uh proteins that
 

7481
02:07:44,880 --> 02:07:47,830
of uh proteins that
uh which change the conformational state

7482
02:07:47,830 --> 02:07:47,840
uh which change the conformational state
 

7483
02:07:47,840 --> 02:07:51,030
uh which change the conformational state
uh chaperone proteins and they're only

7484
02:07:51,030 --> 02:07:51,040
uh chaperone proteins and they're only
 

7485
02:07:51,040 --> 02:07:52,470
uh chaperone proteins and they're only
used when

7486
02:07:52,470 --> 02:07:52,480
used when
 

7487
02:07:52,480 --> 02:07:54,870
used when
when there's some presumably issue with

7488
02:07:54,870 --> 02:07:54,880
when there's some presumably issue with
 

7489
02:07:54,880 --> 02:07:56,470
when there's some presumably issue with
how it came out of the exit tunnel and

7490
02:07:56,470 --> 02:07:56,480
how it came out of the exit tunnel and
 

7491
02:07:56,480 --> 02:07:58,310
how it came out of the exit tunnel and
you want to do it differently to that so

7492
02:07:58,310 --> 02:07:58,320
you want to do it differently to that so
 

7493
02:07:58,320 --> 02:07:59,910
you want to do it differently to that so
very often the chaperone proteins will

7494
02:07:59,910 --> 02:07:59,920
very often the chaperone proteins will
 

7495
02:07:59,920 --> 02:08:02,149
very often the chaperone proteins will
go there and will influence the way in

7496
02:08:02,149 --> 02:08:02,159
go there and will influence the way in
 

7497
02:08:02,159 --> 02:08:03,430
go there and will influence the way in
which it falls

7498
02:08:03,430 --> 02:08:03,440
which it falls
 

7499
02:08:03,440 --> 02:08:05,270
which it falls
so

7500
02:08:05,270 --> 02:08:05,280
so
 

7501
02:08:05,280 --> 02:08:07,030
so
there's two ways of doing it either you

7502
02:08:07,030 --> 02:08:07,040
there's two ways of doing it either you
 

7503
02:08:07,040 --> 02:08:09,270
there's two ways of doing it either you
can you can look at the structures and

7504
02:08:09,270 --> 02:08:09,280
can you can look at the structures and
 

7505
02:08:09,280 --> 02:08:10,950
can you can look at the structures and
the sequences of all the proteins and

7506
02:08:10,950 --> 02:08:10,960
the sequences of all the proteins and
 

7507
02:08:10,960 --> 02:08:13,189
the sequences of all the proteins and
you can apply an immense mind to it and

7508
02:08:13,189 --> 02:08:13,199
you can apply an immense mind to it and
 

7509
02:08:13,199 --> 02:08:14,629
you can apply an immense mind to it and
figure out what the patterns are and

7510
02:08:14,629 --> 02:08:14,639
figure out what the patterns are and
 

7511
02:08:14,639 --> 02:08:16,390
figure out what the patterns are and
figure out what or you can look at the

7512
02:08:16,390 --> 02:08:16,400
figure out what or you can look at the
 

7513
02:08:16,400 --> 02:08:17,990
figure out what or you can look at the
actual situation where it is and say

7514
02:08:17,990 --> 02:08:18,000
actual situation where it is and say
 

7515
02:08:18,000 --> 02:08:19,189
actual situation where it is and say
well hang on it was actually quite

7516
02:08:19,189 --> 02:08:19,199
well hang on it was actually quite
 

7517
02:08:19,199 --> 02:08:21,109
well hang on it was actually quite
simple it's got a charged environment

7518
02:08:21,109 --> 02:08:21,119
simple it's got a charged environment
 

7519
02:08:21,119 --> 02:08:22,310
simple it's got a charged environment
and of course it's forced to come out

7520
02:08:22,310 --> 02:08:22,320
and of course it's forced to come out
 

7521
02:08:22,320 --> 02:08:23,910
and of course it's forced to come out
this way and then the question would be

7522
02:08:23,910 --> 02:08:23,920
this way and then the question would be
 

7523
02:08:23,920 --> 02:08:25,589
this way and then the question would be
well do different ribosomes have

7524
02:08:25,589 --> 02:08:25,599
well do different ribosomes have
 

7525
02:08:25,599 --> 02:08:27,189
well do different ribosomes have
different charged environments what

7526
02:08:27,189 --> 02:08:27,199
different charged environments what
 

7527
02:08:27,199 --> 02:08:28,790
different charged environments what
happens if a chaparral you know you're

7528
02:08:28,790 --> 02:08:28,800
happens if a chaparral you know you're
 

7529
02:08:28,800 --> 02:08:30,390
happens if a chaparral you know you're
asking a different set of questions to

7530
02:08:30,390 --> 02:08:30,400
asking a different set of questions to
 

7531
02:08:30,400 --> 02:08:31,910
asking a different set of questions to
come to the same answer in a way which

7532
02:08:31,910 --> 02:08:31,920
come to the same answer in a way which
 

7533
02:08:31,920 --> 02:08:33,030
come to the same answer in a way which
is telling you

7534
02:08:33,030 --> 02:08:33,040
is telling you
 

7535
02:08:33,040 --> 02:08:35,189
is telling you
a much simpler story and explains why it

7536
02:08:35,189 --> 02:08:35,199
a much simpler story and explains why it
 

7537
02:08:35,199 --> 02:08:37,750
a much simpler story and explains why it
is rather than saying it could be

7538
02:08:37,750 --> 02:08:37,760
is rather than saying it could be
 

7539
02:08:37,760 --> 02:08:39,830
is rather than saying it could be
this is one in a in a billion different

possible conformational states that this
 

7543
02:08:41,520 --> 02:08:42,790
possible conformational states that this

and a huge amount of data of observation
 

7565
02:09:01,280 --> 02:09:03,589
and a huge amount of data of observation
of planets and figure out that earth is

7571
02:09:07,199 --> 02:09:09,030
there's actually a sun we're

solve biology listen protein folding was
 

7611
02:09:53,280 --> 02:09:55,270
solve biology listen protein folding was
thought to be impossible to solve and

7612

thought to be impossible to solve and
 

7613
02:09:55,280 --> 02:09:57,430

that i was able to do that
 

7621
02:10:03,360 --> 02:10:05,030
that i was able to do that
oh i'm not i'm not

wrong question but then
 

7629
02:10:11,040 --> 02:10:14,950
wrong question but then
as the people start to ask better

as the people start to ask better
 

7631
02:10:14,960 --> 02:10:17,109
as the people start to ask better
and bigger questions

there are genetic aspects to it you know

7650
02:10:35,109 --> 02:10:35,119
there are genetic aspects to it you know
 

7651
02:10:35,119 --> 02:10:37,109
there are genetic aspects to it you know
if you spend your whole life

that's a whole separate question
 

7657
02:10:41,440 --> 02:10:43,109
that's a whole separate question
but there's a genetic side to the risk

7658
02:10:43,109 --> 02:10:43,119
but there's a genetic side to the risk
 

7659
02:10:43,119 --> 02:10:45,589
but there's a genetic side to the risk
and and we know a few genes that

7660
02:10:45,589 --> 02:10:45,599
and and we know a few genes that
 

7661
02:10:45,599 --> 02:10:47,350
and and we know a few genes that
increase your risk of certain things and

7662
02:10:47,350 --> 02:10:47,360
increase your risk of certain things and
 

7663
02:10:47,360 --> 02:10:49,830
increase your risk of certain things and

02:11:34,870 --> 02:11:34,880
the other twin identical twin will also
 

7705
02:11:34,880 --> 02:11:36,790
the other twin identical twin will also
get epilepsy therefore the genetic

7706
02:11:36,790 --> 02:11:36,800
get epilepsy therefore the genetic
 

7707
02:11:36,800 --> 02:11:40,310
get epilepsy therefore the genetic
factor is about 50 percent uh and so the

7708
02:11:40,310 --> 02:11:40,320
factor is about 50 percent uh and so the
 

7709
02:11:40,320 --> 02:11:41,669
factor is about 50 percent uh and so the
the gene

7710
02:11:41,669 --> 02:11:41,679
the gene
 

7711
02:11:41,679 --> 02:11:43,589
the gene
similarities that you see should account

7712
02:11:43,589 --> 02:11:43,599
similarities that you see should account
 

7713
02:11:43,599 --> 02:11:44,550
similarities that you see should account
for 50

7714
02:11:44,550 --> 02:11:44,560
for 50
 

7715
02:11:44,560 --> 02:11:46,229
for 50
of that known risk

7716
02:11:46,229 --> 02:11:46,239
of that known risk
 

7717
02:11:46,239 --> 02:11:48,470
of that known risk
very often it accounts for less than a

7718
02:11:48,470 --> 02:11:48,480
very often it accounts for less than a
 

7719
02:11:48,480 --> 02:11:50,629
very often it accounts for less than a
tenth of the known risk

7720
02:11:50,629 --> 02:11:50,639
tenth of the known risk
 

7721
02:11:50,639 --> 02:11:52,790
tenth of the known risk
and there's two possible explanations

7722
02:11:52,790 --> 02:11:52,800
and there's two possible explanations
 

7723
02:11:52,800 --> 02:11:54,310
and there's two possible explanations
and there's one which people tend to do

7724
02:11:54,310 --> 02:11:54,320
and there's one which people tend to do
 

7725
02:11:54,320 --> 02:11:56,470
and there's one which people tend to do
which is to say ah well we don't have

7726
02:11:56,470 --> 02:11:56,480
which is to say ah well we don't have
 

7727
02:11:56,480 --> 02:11:59,109
which is to say ah well we don't have
enough statistical power if we maybe

7728
02:11:59,109 --> 02:11:59,119
enough statistical power if we maybe
 

7729
02:11:59,119 --> 02:12:00,310
enough statistical power if we maybe
there's maybe there's a million we've

7730
02:12:00,310 --> 02:12:00,320
there's maybe there's a million we've
 

7731
02:12:00,320 --> 02:12:01,830
there's maybe there's a million we've
only found a thousand of them but if we

7732
02:12:01,830 --> 02:12:01,840
only found a thousand of them but if we
 

7733
02:12:01,840 --> 02:12:03,270
only found a thousand of them but if we
found the other million they're weakly

7734
02:12:03,270 --> 02:12:03,280
found the other million they're weakly
 

7735
02:12:03,280 --> 02:12:04,790
found the other million they're weakly
related but there's a huge number of

7736
02:12:04,790 --> 02:12:04,800
related but there's a huge number of
 

7737
02:12:04,800 --> 02:12:06,629
related but there's a huge number of
them and so we'll account for that whole

7738
02:12:06,629 --> 02:12:06,639
them and so we'll account for that whole
 

7739
02:12:06,639 --> 02:12:08,950
them and so we'll account for that whole
risk maybe there's i mean you know maybe

7740
02:12:08,950 --> 02:12:08,960
risk maybe there's i mean you know maybe
 

7741
02:12:08,960 --> 02:12:11,430
risk maybe there's i mean you know maybe
there's a billion of them for instance

7742
02:12:11,430 --> 02:12:11,440
there's a billion of them for instance
 

7743
02:12:11,440 --> 02:12:13,669
there's a billion of them for instance
so so that's one way the other way is to

7744
02:12:13,669 --> 02:12:13,679
so so that's one way the other way is to
 

7745
02:12:13,679 --> 02:12:15,030
so so that's one way the other way is to
say

7746
02:12:15,030 --> 02:12:15,040
say
 

7747
02:12:15,040 --> 02:12:16,229
say
well hang on a minute you're missing a

7748
02:12:16,229 --> 02:12:16,239
well hang on a minute you're missing a
 

7749
02:12:16,239 --> 02:12:17,589
well hang on a minute you're missing a
system here that system is the

7750
02:12:17,589 --> 02:12:17,599
system here that system is the
 

7751
02:12:17,599 --> 02:12:20,069
system here that system is the
mitochondrial dna which people tend to

7752
02:12:20,069 --> 02:12:20,079
mitochondrial dna which people tend to
 

7753
02:12:20,079 --> 02:12:23,189
mitochondrial dna which people tend to
dismiss because it's small and it's not

7754
02:12:23,189 --> 02:12:23,199
dismiss because it's small and it's not
 

7755
02:12:23,199 --> 02:12:26,870
dismiss because it's small and it's not
uh it doesn't change very much

7756
02:12:26,870 --> 02:12:26,880

 

7757
02:12:26,880 --> 02:12:28,149

but a few

7758
02:12:28,149 --> 02:12:28,159
but a few
 

7759
02:12:28,159 --> 02:12:29,350
but a few
single letter changes in that

7760
02:12:29,350 --> 02:12:29,360
single letter changes in that
 

7761
02:12:29,360 --> 02:12:32,390
single letter changes in that
mitochondrial dna it it controls some

7762
02:12:32,390 --> 02:12:32,400
mitochondrial dna it it controls some
 

7763
02:12:32,400 --> 02:12:34,870
mitochondrial dna it it controls some
really basic processes it controls

7764
02:12:34,870 --> 02:12:34,880
really basic processes it controls
 

7765
02:12:34,880 --> 02:12:37,350
really basic processes it controls
not only all the energy that we need to

7766
02:12:37,350 --> 02:12:37,360
not only all the energy that we need to
 

7767
02:12:37,360 --> 02:12:38,950
not only all the energy that we need to
live and to move around and do

7768
02:12:38,950 --> 02:12:38,960
live and to move around and do
 

7769
02:12:38,960 --> 02:12:41,990
live and to move around and do
everything we do but also biosynthesis

7770
02:12:41,990 --> 02:12:42,000
everything we do but also biosynthesis
 

7771
02:12:42,000 --> 02:12:44,709
everything we do but also biosynthesis
to make the new building blocks to you

7772
02:12:44,709 --> 02:12:44,719
to make the new building blocks to you
 

7773
02:12:44,719 --> 02:12:45,430
to make the new building blocks to you
know

7774
02:12:45,430 --> 02:12:45,440
know
 

7775
02:12:45,440 --> 02:12:48,229
know
to to to make new cells and cancer cells

7776
02:12:48,229 --> 02:12:48,239
to to to make new cells and cancer cells
 

7777
02:12:48,239 --> 02:12:49,750
to to to make new cells and cancer cells
very often kind of take over the

7778
02:12:49,750 --> 02:12:49,760
very often kind of take over the
 

7779
02:12:49,760 --> 02:12:52,709
very often kind of take over the
mitochondria and rewire them so that

7780
02:12:52,709 --> 02:12:52,719
mitochondria and rewire them so that
 

7781
02:12:52,719 --> 02:12:54,470
mitochondria and rewire them so that
instead of using them for making energy

7782
02:12:54,470 --> 02:12:54,480
instead of using them for making energy
 

7783
02:12:54,480 --> 02:12:55,669
instead of using them for making energy
they're effectively using them as

7784
02:12:55,669 --> 02:12:55,679
they're effectively using them as
 

7785
02:12:55,679 --> 02:12:57,270
they're effectively using them as
precursors for the building blocks for

7786
02:12:57,270 --> 02:12:57,280
precursors for the building blocks for
 

7787
02:12:57,280 --> 02:12:59,510
precursors for the building blocks for
biosynthesis you need to make new amino

7788
02:12:59,510 --> 02:12:59,520
biosynthesis you need to make new amino
 

7789
02:12:59,520 --> 02:13:01,589
biosynthesis you need to make new amino
acids new nucleotides for dna you want

7790
02:13:01,589 --> 02:13:01,599
acids new nucleotides for dna you want
 

7791
02:13:01,599 --> 02:13:03,430
acids new nucleotides for dna you want
to make new lipids to make your

7792
02:13:03,430 --> 02:13:03,440
to make new lipids to make your
 

7793
02:13:03,440 --> 02:13:05,350
to make new lipids to make your
membranes and so on so they kind of

7794
02:13:05,350 --> 02:13:05,360
membranes and so on so they kind of
 

7795
02:13:05,360 --> 02:13:08,709
membranes and so on so they kind of
rewire metabolism now the problem is

7796
02:13:08,709 --> 02:13:08,719
rewire metabolism now the problem is
 

7797
02:13:08,719 --> 02:13:09,990
rewire metabolism now the problem is
that we've got all these interactions

7798
02:13:09,990 --> 02:13:10,000
that we've got all these interactions
 

7799
02:13:10,000 --> 02:13:11,830
that we've got all these interactions
between mitochondrial dna and the genes

7800
02:13:11,830 --> 02:13:11,840
between mitochondrial dna and the genes
 

7801
02:13:11,840 --> 02:13:13,189
between mitochondrial dna and the genes
in the nucleus

7802
02:13:13,189 --> 02:13:13,199
in the nucleus
 

7803
02:13:13,199 --> 02:13:15,589
in the nucleus
that are overlooked completely because

7804
02:13:15,589 --> 02:13:15,599
that are overlooked completely because
 

7805
02:13:15,599 --> 02:13:17,430
that are overlooked completely because
people throw away literally throw away

7806
02:13:17,430 --> 02:13:17,440
people throw away literally throw away
 

7807
02:13:17,440 --> 02:13:19,270
people throw away literally throw away
the mitochondrial genes and we can see

7808
02:13:19,270 --> 02:13:19,280
the mitochondrial genes and we can see
 

7809
02:13:19,280 --> 02:13:21,030
the mitochondrial genes and we can see
in in fruit flies that they interact and

7810
02:13:21,030 --> 02:13:21,040
in in fruit flies that they interact and
 

7811
02:13:21,040 --> 02:13:22,149
in in fruit flies that they interact and
produce

7812
02:13:22,149 --> 02:13:22,159
produce
 

7813
02:13:22,159 --> 02:13:24,390
produce
big differences in risk

7814
02:13:24,390 --> 02:13:24,400
big differences in risk
 

7815
02:13:24,400 --> 02:13:26,709
big differences in risk
so you can set

7816
02:13:26,709 --> 02:13:26,719
so you can set
 

7817
02:13:26,719 --> 02:13:30,229
so you can set
uh you can set ai onto this question of

7818
02:13:30,229 --> 02:13:30,239
uh you can set ai onto this question of
 

7819
02:13:30,239 --> 02:13:32,229
uh you can set ai onto this question of
exactly what

7820
02:13:32,229 --> 02:13:32,239
exactly what
 

7821
02:13:32,239 --> 02:13:34,229
exactly what
uh you know how many of these base

7822
02:13:34,229 --> 02:13:34,239
uh you know how many of these base
 

7823
02:13:34,239 --> 02:13:35,830
uh you know how many of these base
changes there are and this is one

7824
02:13:35,830 --> 02:13:35,840
changes there are and this is one
 

7825
02:13:35,840 --> 02:13:37,910
changes there are and this is one
possible solution that maybe

7826
02:13:37,910 --> 02:13:37,920
possible solution that maybe
 

7827
02:13:37,920 --> 02:13:39,350
possible solution that maybe
there are a million of them and it does

7828
02:13:39,350 --> 02:13:39,360
there are a million of them and it does
 

7829
02:13:39,360 --> 02:13:40,950
there are a million of them and it does
account for the great part of the risk

7830
02:13:40,950 --> 02:13:40,960
account for the great part of the risk
 

7831
02:13:40,960 --> 02:13:42,870
account for the great part of the risk
well the other one is they aren't it's

7832
02:13:42,870 --> 02:13:42,880
well the other one is they aren't it's
 

7833
02:13:42,880 --> 02:13:44,390
well the other one is they aren't it's
just not there that actually the risk

7834
02:13:44,390 --> 02:13:44,400
just not there that actually the risk
 

7835
02:13:44,400 --> 02:13:45,990
just not there that actually the risk
lies in something you weren't even

7836
02:13:45,990 --> 02:13:46,000
lies in something you weren't even
 

7837
02:13:46,000 --> 02:13:48,390
lies in something you weren't even
looking at and this is where human

7838
02:13:48,390 --> 02:13:48,400
looking at and this is where human
 

7839
02:13:48,400 --> 02:13:49,510
looking at and this is where human
intuition

7840
02:13:49,510 --> 02:13:49,520
intuition
 

7841
02:13:49,520 --> 02:13:51,589
intuition
is very important and just this feeling

7842
02:13:51,589 --> 02:13:51,599
is very important and just this feeling
 

7843
02:13:51,599 --> 02:13:53,669
is very important and just this feeling
that well i'm working on this and i

7844
02:13:53,669 --> 02:13:53,679
that well i'm working on this and i
 

7845
02:13:53,679 --> 02:13:55,350
that well i'm working on this and i
think it's important and i'm bloody

7846
02:13:55,350 --> 02:13:55,360
think it's important and i'm bloody
 

7847
02:13:55,360 --> 02:13:56,790
think it's important and i'm bloody
minded about it and in the end some

7848
02:13:56,790 --> 02:13:56,800
minded about it and in the end some
 

7849
02:13:56,800 --> 02:13:58,149
minded about it and in the end some
people are right it turns out that it

7850
02:13:58,149 --> 02:13:58,159
people are right it turns out that it
 

7851
02:13:58,159 --> 02:13:59,990
people are right it turns out that it
was important

7852
02:13:59,990 --> 02:14:00,000
was important
 

7853
02:14:00,000 --> 02:14:01,589
was important
can you get ai to do that to be

7854
02:14:01,589 --> 02:14:01,599
can you get ai to do that to be
 

7855
02:14:01,599 --> 02:14:03,189
can you get ai to do that to be
bloody-minded

7856
02:14:03,189 --> 02:14:03,199
bloody-minded
 

7857
02:14:03,199 --> 02:14:06,550
bloody-minded
and uh that that that hang on a minute

7858
02:14:06,550 --> 02:14:06,560
and uh that that that hang on a minute
 

7859
02:14:06,560 --> 02:14:08,629
and uh that that that hang on a minute
you might be missing a whole other

7860
02:14:08,629 --> 02:14:08,639
you might be missing a whole other
 

7861
02:14:08,639 --> 02:14:11,030
you might be missing a whole other
system here that's much bigger

7862
02:14:11,030 --> 02:14:11,040
system here that's much bigger
 

7863
02:14:11,040 --> 02:14:12,870
system here that's much bigger
that's that's huma that's

7864
02:14:12,870 --> 02:14:12,880
that's that's huma that's
 

7865
02:14:12,880 --> 02:14:14,870
that's that's huma that's
that's the moment of discovery of

7866
02:14:14,870 --> 02:14:14,880
that's the moment of discovery of
 

7867
02:14:14,880 --> 02:14:17,430
that's the moment of discovery of
scientific revolution

7868
02:14:17,430 --> 02:14:17,440
scientific revolution
 

7869
02:14:17,440 --> 02:14:18,390
scientific revolution
i'm

7870
02:14:18,390 --> 02:14:18,400
i'm
 

7871
02:14:18,400 --> 02:14:20,629
i'm
giving up on saying hey i can't do

7872
02:14:20,629 --> 02:14:20,639
giving up on saying hey i can't do
 

7873
02:14:20,639 --> 02:14:22,149
giving up on saying hey i can't do
something

7874
02:14:22,149 --> 02:14:22,159
something
 

7875
02:14:22,159 --> 02:14:24,709
something
i've said it enough times about enough

7876
02:14:24,709 --> 02:14:24,719
i've said it enough times about enough
 

7877
02:14:24,719 --> 02:14:26,310
i've said it enough times about enough
things i think there's been a lot of

7878
02:14:26,310 --> 02:14:26,320
things i think there's been a lot of
 

7879
02:14:26,320 --> 02:14:27,430
things i think there's been a lot of
progress

7880
02:14:27,430 --> 02:14:27,440
progress
 

7881
02:14:27,440 --> 02:14:29,510
progress
and uh instead i'm excited by the

7882
02:14:29,510 --> 02:14:29,520
and uh instead i'm excited by the
 

7883
02:14:29,520 --> 02:14:32,229
and uh instead i'm excited by the
possibility of ai helping humans but at

7884
02:14:32,229 --> 02:14:32,239
possibility of ai helping humans but at
 

7885
02:14:32,239 --> 02:14:34,709
possibility of ai helping humans but at
the same time just like i said we seem

7886
02:14:34,709 --> 02:14:34,719
the same time just like i said we seem
 

7887
02:14:34,719 --> 02:14:38,310
the same time just like i said we seem
to dismiss the power of humans yes yes

7888
02:14:38,310 --> 02:14:38,320
to dismiss the power of humans yes yes
 

7889
02:14:38,320 --> 02:14:40,390
to dismiss the power of humans yes yes
like we're so limited

7890
02:14:40,390 --> 02:14:40,400
like we're so limited
 

7891
02:14:40,400 --> 02:14:43,030
like we're so limited
in so many ways

02:14:43,030 --> 02:14:43,040
in so many ways
 

7893
02:14:43,040 --> 02:14:43,830

that kind of
 

7897
02:14:45,520 --> 02:14:49,030
that kind of

02:14:49,030 --> 02:14:49,040
in in what we feel like dumb ways like
 

7899
02:14:49,040 --> 02:14:50,950
in in what we feel like dumb ways like
we're not strong

7900

we're not strong

ability to focus on things is limited
 

7909
02:15:00,159 --> 02:15:02,629
ability to focus on things is limited
in our own perception of what limited is

in our own perception of what limited is
 

7911
02:15:02,639 --> 02:15:04,870
in our own perception of what limited is
but that actually there's an incredible

but that actually there's an incredible
 

7913
02:15:04,880 --> 02:15:06,790
but that actually there's an incredible
computer behind the whole thing that

7914
02:15:06,790 --> 02:15:06,800
computer behind the whole thing that
 

7915
02:15:06,800 --> 02:15:09,189
computer behind the whole thing that
makes this whole system work our ability

7916
02:15:09,189 --> 02:15:09,199
makes this whole system work our ability
 

7917
02:15:09,199 --> 02:15:10,229
makes this whole system work our ability
to

to
 

7919
02:15:10,239 --> 02:15:12,069
to
interact with the environment to reason

7920
02:15:12,069 --> 02:15:12,079
interact with the environment to reason
 

7921
02:15:12,079 --> 02:15:14,069
interact with the environment to reason
about the environment there's magic

7922
02:15:14,069 --> 02:15:14,079
about the environment there's magic
 

7923
02:15:14,079 --> 02:15:16,870
about the environment there's magic
there and i i'm hopeful that ai can

7924
02:15:16,870 --> 02:15:16,880
there and i i'm hopeful that ai can
 

7925
02:15:16,880 --> 02:15:18,870
there and i i'm hopeful that ai can
capture some of that same magic but that

7926
02:15:18,870 --> 02:15:18,880
capture some of that same magic but that
 

7927
02:15:18,880 --> 02:15:20,950
capture some of that same magic but that
magic is not going to look like uh deep

7928
02:15:20,950 --> 02:15:20,960
magic is not going to look like uh deep
 

7929
02:15:20,960 --> 02:15:24,069
magic is not going to look like uh deep
blue playing chess no it's going to be

7930
02:15:24,069 --> 02:15:24,079
blue playing chess no it's going to be
 

7931
02:15:24,079 --> 02:15:25,350
blue playing chess no it's going to be
more interesting but i don't think it's

7932
02:15:25,350 --> 02:15:25,360
more interesting but i don't think it's
 

7933
02:15:25,360 --> 02:15:27,189
more interesting but i don't think it's
going to look like a pattern finding

7934
02:15:27,189 --> 02:15:27,199
going to look like a pattern finding
 

7935
02:15:27,199 --> 02:15:29,030
going to look like a pattern finding
either i mean that's essentially what

7936
02:15:29,030 --> 02:15:29,040
either i mean that's essentially what

you're telling me it does very well at

7938
02:15:30,229 --> 02:15:30,239
you're telling me it does very well at
 

7939
02:15:30,239 --> 02:15:31,990
you're telling me it does very well at
the moment and my point is

7940
02:15:31,990 --> 02:15:32,000
the moment and my point is
 

7941
02:15:32,000 --> 02:15:34,310
the moment and my point is
it works very well where you're looking

7942
02:15:34,310 --> 02:15:34,320
it works very well where you're looking
 

7943
02:15:34,320 --> 02:15:36,870
it works very well where you're looking
for the right pattern but we are

7944
02:15:36,870 --> 02:15:36,880
for the right pattern but we are

02:15:36,880 --> 02:15:39,430
for the right pattern but we are

storytelling animals and the hypothesis
 

7947
02:15:39,440 --> 02:15:40,709
storytelling animals and the hypothesis
is a story

7948
02:15:40,709 --> 02:15:40,719
is a story
 

7949
02:15:40,719 --> 02:15:44,390
is a story
it's a testable story but but you know a

7950
02:15:44,390 --> 02:15:44,400
it's a testable story but but you know a
 

7951
02:15:44,400 --> 02:15:46,629
it's a testable story but but you know a
new hypothesis is a leap into the

7952
02:15:46,629 --> 02:15:46,639
new hypothesis is a leap into the
 

7953
02:15:46,639 --> 02:15:48,310
new hypothesis is a leap into the
unknown and it's a new story basically

7954
02:15:48,310 --> 02:15:48,320
unknown and it's a new story basically
 

7955
02:15:48,320 --> 02:15:50,629
unknown and it's a new story basically
and it says uh this leads to this leads

7956
02:15:50,629 --> 02:15:50,639
and it says uh this leads to this leads
 

7957
02:15:50,639 --> 02:15:53,510
and it says uh this leads to this leads
to that it's a causal set of of of

7958
02:15:53,510 --> 02:15:53,520
to that it's a causal set of of of

to that it's a causal set of of of

storytelling
it's also possible that the leap into

7962
02:15:56,709 --> 02:15:56,719
it's also possible that the leap into
 

7963
02:15:56,719 --> 02:15:58,870
it's also possible that the leap into
the unknown has a pattern of its own yes

7964
02:15:58,870 --> 02:15:58,880
the unknown has a pattern of its own yes
 

7965
02:15:58,880 --> 02:16:00,149
the unknown has a pattern of its own yes
it is

7966
02:16:00,149 --> 02:16:00,159
it is
 

7967
02:16:00,159 --> 02:16:02,390
it is
possible let's learn learnable

7968
02:16:02,390 --> 02:16:02,400
possible let's learn learnable
 

7969
02:16:02,400 --> 02:16:05,589
possible let's learn learnable
i'm sure it is there's a nice uh book by

7970
02:16:05,589 --> 02:16:05,599
i'm sure it is there's a nice uh book by
 

7971
02:16:05,599 --> 02:16:09,109
i'm sure it is there's a nice uh book by
arthur cursler on um

7972
02:16:09,109 --> 02:16:09,119
arthur cursler on um
 

7973
02:16:09,119 --> 02:16:11,589
arthur cursler on um
on on the nature of creativity and and

7974
02:16:11,589 --> 02:16:11,599
on on the nature of creativity and and
 

7975
02:16:11,599 --> 02:16:12,950
on on the nature of creativity and and
he likens it to a joke where the

7976
02:16:12,950 --> 02:16:12,960
he likens it to a joke where the
 

7977
02:16:12,960 --> 02:16:14,470
he likens it to a joke where the
punchline goes off in a completely

7978
02:16:14,470 --> 02:16:14,480
punchline goes off in a completely
 

7979
02:16:14,480 --> 02:16:16,069
punchline goes off in a completely
unexpected direction and says that this

7980
02:16:16,069 --> 02:16:16,079
unexpected direction and says that this
 

7981
02:16:16,079 --> 02:16:17,350
unexpected direction and says that this
is the basis of

7982
02:16:17,350 --> 02:16:17,360
is the basis of
 

7983
02:16:17,360 --> 02:16:19,669
is the basis of
human creativity that you know some

7984
02:16:19,669 --> 02:16:19,679
human creativity that you know some
 

7985
02:16:19,679 --> 02:16:21,669
human creativity that you know some
creative switch of direction to an

7986
02:16:21,669 --> 02:16:21,679
creative switch of direction to an
 

7987
02:16:21,679 --> 02:16:24,870
creative switch of direction to an
unexpected place is similar to to a

7988
02:16:24,870 --> 02:16:24,880
unexpected place is similar to to a
 

7989
02:16:24,880 --> 02:16:26,709
unexpected place is similar to to a
i'm not saying that's how it works but

7990
02:16:26,709 --> 02:16:26,719
i'm not saying that's how it works but
 

7991
02:16:26,719 --> 02:16:28,229
i'm not saying that's how it works but
it's a nice idea and there's must be

7992
02:16:28,229 --> 02:16:28,239
it's a nice idea and there's must be
 

7993
02:16:28,239 --> 02:16:29,750
it's a nice idea and there's must be
some truth in it

7994
02:16:29,750 --> 02:16:29,760
some truth in it
 

7995
02:16:29,760 --> 02:16:30,629
some truth in it
um

7996
02:16:30,629 --> 02:16:30,639
um
 

7997
02:16:30,639 --> 02:16:32,389
um
and it's one of these

7998
02:16:32,389 --> 02:16:32,399
and it's one of these
 

7999
02:16:32,399 --> 02:16:34,070
and it's one of these
most of the stories we tell are probably

8000
02:16:34,070 --> 02:16:34,080
most of the stories we tell are probably
 

8001
02:16:34,080 --> 02:16:35,509
most of the stories we tell are probably
the wrong story and probably going

8002
02:16:35,509 --> 02:16:35,519
the wrong story and probably going
 

8003
02:16:35,519 --> 02:16:37,830
the wrong story and probably going
nowhere and probably not helpful and we

8004
02:16:37,830 --> 02:16:37,840
nowhere and probably not helpful and we
 

8005
02:16:37,840 --> 02:16:40,230
nowhere and probably not helpful and we
definitely don't do as well at seeing

8006
02:16:40,230 --> 02:16:40,240
definitely don't do as well at seeing
 

8007
02:16:40,240 --> 02:16:42,870
definitely don't do as well at seeing
patterns in things but some of the most

8008
02:16:42,870 --> 02:16:42,880
patterns in things but some of the most
 

8009
02:16:42,880 --> 02:16:45,270
patterns in things but some of the most
enjoyable human aspects is is finding a

8010
02:16:45,270 --> 02:16:45,280
enjoyable human aspects is is finding a
 

8011
02:16:45,280 --> 02:16:47,270
enjoyable human aspects is is finding a
new story that goes to an unexpected

8012
02:16:47,270 --> 02:16:47,280
new story that goes to an unexpected
 

8013
02:16:47,280 --> 02:16:49,750
new story that goes to an unexpected
place and these are all aspects of what

8014
02:16:49,750 --> 02:16:49,760
place and these are all aspects of what
 

8015
02:16:49,760 --> 02:16:51,750
place and these are all aspects of what
being human means to me

8016
02:16:51,750 --> 02:16:51,760
being human means to me
 

8017
02:16:51,760 --> 02:16:54,150
being human means to me
um and maybe these are all things that

8018
02:16:54,150 --> 02:16:54,160
um and maybe these are all things that
 

8019
02:16:54,160 --> 02:16:56,070
um and maybe these are all things that
that ai figures out for itself or maybe

8020
02:16:56,070 --> 02:16:56,080
that ai figures out for itself or maybe
 

8021
02:16:56,080 --> 02:16:57,910
that ai figures out for itself or maybe
they're just aspects

8022
02:16:57,910 --> 02:16:57,920
they're just aspects
 

8023
02:16:57,920 --> 02:17:00,150
they're just aspects
but i i just have the feeling sometimes

8024
02:17:00,150 --> 02:17:00,160
but i i just have the feeling sometimes
 

8025
02:17:00,160 --> 02:17:02,150
but i i just have the feeling sometimes
that the people who

8026
02:17:02,150 --> 02:17:02,160
that the people who
 

8027
02:17:02,160 --> 02:17:04,150
that the people who
are trying to

8028
02:17:04,150 --> 02:17:04,160
are trying to
 

8029
02:17:04,160 --> 02:17:06,150
are trying to
understand what to

8030
02:17:06,150 --> 02:17:06,160
understand what to
 

8031
02:17:06,160 --> 02:17:08,790
understand what to
what we are like what weird what we if

8032
02:17:08,790 --> 02:17:08,800
what we are like what weird what we if
 

8033
02:17:08,800 --> 02:17:10,870
what we are like what weird what we if
we wish to craft an ai system which is

8034
02:17:10,870 --> 02:17:10,880
we wish to craft an ai system which is
 

8035
02:17:10,880 --> 02:17:12,629
we wish to craft an ai system which is
somehow human-like

8036
02:17:12,629 --> 02:17:12,639
somehow human-like
 

8037
02:17:12,639 --> 02:17:15,910
somehow human-like
that we don't have a firm enough

8038
02:17:15,910 --> 02:17:15,920
that we don't have a firm enough
 

8039
02:17:15,920 --> 02:17:17,190
that we don't have a firm enough
grasp of

8040
02:17:17,190 --> 02:17:17,200
grasp of
 

8041
02:17:17,200 --> 02:17:19,349
grasp of
what humans really are like in terms of

8042
02:17:19,349 --> 02:17:19,359
what humans really are like in terms of
 

8043
02:17:19,359 --> 02:17:21,349
what humans really are like in terms of
how we are built

8044
02:17:21,349 --> 02:17:21,359
how we are built
 

8045
02:17:21,359 --> 02:17:23,750
how we are built
but we uh get a better better

8046
02:17:23,750 --> 02:17:23,760
but we uh get a better better
 

8047
02:17:23,760 --> 02:17:25,429
but we uh get a better better
understanding of that i agree with you

8048
02:17:25,429 --> 02:17:25,439
understanding of that i agree with you
 

8049
02:17:25,439 --> 02:17:27,990
understanding of that i agree with you
completely we try to build the thing and

8050
02:17:27,990 --> 02:17:28,000
completely we try to build the thing and
 

8051
02:17:28,000 --> 02:17:29,190
completely we try to build the thing and
then we'll go

8052
02:17:29,190 --> 02:17:29,200
then we'll go
 

8053
02:17:29,200 --> 02:17:31,349
then we'll go
hang on in a minute yeah

8054
02:17:31,349 --> 02:17:31,359
hang on in a minute yeah
 

8055
02:17:31,359 --> 02:17:33,349
hang on in a minute yeah
there's another system here and that's

8056
02:17:33,349 --> 02:17:33,359
there's another system here and that's
 

8057
02:17:33,359 --> 02:17:35,750
there's another system here and that's
actually the attempt to build ai

8058
02:17:35,750 --> 02:17:35,760
actually the attempt to build ai
 

8059
02:17:35,760 --> 02:17:37,589
actually the attempt to build ai
that's human-like is getting us to a

8060
02:17:37,589 --> 02:17:37,599
that's human-like is getting us to a
 

8061
02:17:37,599 --> 02:17:39,750
that's human-like is getting us to a
deeper understanding of human beings

8062
02:17:39,750 --> 02:17:39,760
deeper understanding of human beings
 

8063
02:17:39,760 --> 02:17:41,589
deeper understanding of human beings
the funny thing i recently talked to

8064
02:17:41,589 --> 02:17:41,599
the funny thing i recently talked to
 

8065
02:17:41,599 --> 02:17:43,509
the funny thing i recently talked to
magnus carlson the widely considered to

8066
02:17:43,509 --> 02:17:43,519
magnus carlson the widely considered to
 

8067
02:17:43,519 --> 02:17:46,389
magnus carlson the widely considered to
be the greatest chess player of all time

8068
02:17:46,389 --> 02:17:46,399
be the greatest chess player of all time
 

8069
02:17:46,399 --> 02:17:48,790
be the greatest chess player of all time
and he talked about alpha zero which is

8070
02:17:48,790 --> 02:17:48,800
and he talked about alpha zero which is
 

8071
02:17:48,800 --> 02:17:51,429
and he talked about alpha zero which is
a system from deepmind that plays chess

8072
02:17:51,429 --> 02:17:51,439
a system from deepmind that plays chess
 

8073
02:17:51,439 --> 02:17:54,790
a system from deepmind that plays chess
and he had a funny comment

8074
02:17:54,790 --> 02:17:54,800
and he had a funny comment
 

8075
02:17:54,800 --> 02:17:57,429
and he had a funny comment
um he has a kind of dry sense of humor

8076
02:17:57,429 --> 02:17:57,439
um he has a kind of dry sense of humor
 

8077
02:17:57,439 --> 02:17:59,509
um he has a kind of dry sense of humor
but he was extremely impressed when he

8078
02:17:59,509 --> 02:17:59,519
but he was extremely impressed when he
 

8079
02:17:59,519 --> 02:18:02,150
but he was extremely impressed when he
first saw alpha zero play

8080
02:18:02,150 --> 02:18:02,160
first saw alpha zero play
 

8081
02:18:02,160 --> 02:18:04,389
first saw alpha zero play
and he said that it did a lot of things

8082
02:18:04,389 --> 02:18:04,399
and he said that it did a lot of things
 

8083
02:18:04,399 --> 02:18:06,389
and he said that it did a lot of things
that could easily be mistaken for

8084
02:18:06,389 --> 02:18:06,399
that could easily be mistaken for
 

8085
02:18:06,399 --> 02:18:07,160
that could easily be mistaken for
creativity

8086
02:18:07,160 --> 02:18:07,170
creativity
 

8087
02:18:07,170 --> 02:18:08,870
creativity
[Laughter]

8088
02:18:08,870 --> 02:18:08,880
[Laughter]
 

8089
02:18:08,880 --> 02:18:11,990
[Laughter]
uh so he like refute as a typical human

8090
02:18:11,990 --> 02:18:12,000
uh so he like refute as a typical human
 

8091
02:18:12,000 --> 02:18:14,870
uh so he like refute as a typical human
refused to give the system

8092
02:18:14,870 --> 02:18:14,880
refused to give the system
 

8093
02:18:14,880 --> 02:18:17,589
refused to give the system
sort of it's due because he came up with

8094
02:18:17,589 --> 02:18:17,599
sort of it's due because he came up with
 

8095
02:18:17,599 --> 02:18:20,629
sort of it's due because he came up with
a lot of things that a lot of people

8096
02:18:20,629 --> 02:18:20,639
a lot of things that a lot of people
 

8097
02:18:20,639 --> 02:18:23,030
a lot of things that a lot of people
are extremely impressed by not just the

8098
02:18:23,030 --> 02:18:23,040
are extremely impressed by not just the
 

8099
02:18:23,040 --> 02:18:24,870
are extremely impressed by not just the
sheer calculation but

8100
02:18:24,870 --> 02:18:24,880
sheer calculation but
 

8101
02:18:24,880 --> 02:18:27,750
sheer calculation but
the the brilliance of play so one of the

8102
02:18:27,750 --> 02:18:27,760
the the brilliance of play so one of the
 

8103
02:18:27,760 --> 02:18:30,230
the the brilliance of play so one of the
things that um

8104
02:18:30,230 --> 02:18:30,240
things that um
 

8105
02:18:30,240 --> 02:18:31,750
things that um
it does

8106
02:18:31,750 --> 02:18:31,760
it does
 

8107
02:18:31,760 --> 02:18:33,509
it does
in really interesting ways is it

8108
02:18:33,509 --> 02:18:33,519
in really interesting ways is it
 

8109
02:18:33,519 --> 02:18:35,270
in really interesting ways is it
sacrifices pieces

8110
02:18:35,270 --> 02:18:35,280
sacrifices pieces
 

8111
02:18:35,280 --> 02:18:37,509
sacrifices pieces
so in chess that means you you you

8112
02:18:37,509 --> 02:18:37,519
so in chess that means you you you
 

8113
02:18:37,519 --> 02:18:39,990
so in chess that means you you you
basically take a few steps back in order

8114
02:18:39,990 --> 02:18:40,000
basically take a few steps back in order
 

8115
02:18:40,000 --> 02:18:42,389
basically take a few steps back in order
to take a step forward you give away

8116
02:18:42,389 --> 02:18:42,399
to take a step forward you give away
 

8117
02:18:42,399 --> 02:18:46,070
to take a step forward you give away
pieces for some future reward

8118
02:18:46,070 --> 02:18:46,080
pieces for some future reward
 

8119
02:18:46,080 --> 02:18:47,349
pieces for some future reward
and that

8120
02:18:47,349 --> 02:18:47,359
and that
 

8121
02:18:47,359 --> 02:18:50,549
and that
for us humans is where art is in chess

8122
02:18:50,549 --> 02:18:50,559
for us humans is where art is in chess
 

8123
02:18:50,559 --> 02:18:52,389
for us humans is where art is in chess
you take big risks

8124
02:18:52,389 --> 02:18:52,399
you take big risks
 

8125
02:18:52,399 --> 02:18:53,190
you take big risks
that

8126
02:18:53,190 --> 02:18:53,200
that
 

8127
02:18:53,200 --> 02:18:55,910
that
uh for us humans

8128
02:18:55,910 --> 02:18:55,920
uh for us humans
 

8129
02:18:55,920 --> 02:18:58,469
uh for us humans
those risks are especially painful

8130
02:18:58,469 --> 02:18:58,479
those risks are especially painful
 

8131
02:18:58,479 --> 02:18:59,669
those risks are especially painful
because

8132
02:18:59,669 --> 02:18:59,679
because
 

8133
02:18:59,679 --> 02:19:02,150
because
you have a fog of uncertainty before you

8134
02:19:02,150 --> 02:19:02,160
you have a fog of uncertainty before you
 

8135
02:19:02,160 --> 02:19:03,990
you have a fog of uncertainty before you
so to take a risk now based on the

8136
02:19:03,990 --> 02:19:04,000
so to take a risk now based on the
 

8137
02:19:04,000 --> 02:19:06,230
so to take a risk now based on the
intuition of i think this is the right

8138
02:19:06,230 --> 02:19:06,240
intuition of i think this is the right
 

8139
02:19:06,240 --> 02:19:08,309
intuition of i think this is the right
risk to take but there's so many

8140
02:19:08,309 --> 02:19:08,319
risk to take but there's so many
 

8141
02:19:08,319 --> 02:19:10,790
risk to take but there's so many
possibilities that that's where it takes

8142
02:19:10,790 --> 02:19:10,800
possibilities that that's where it takes
 

8143
02:19:10,800 --> 02:19:12,950
possibilities that that's where it takes
guts that's where art is that's that

8144
02:19:12,950 --> 02:19:12,960
guts that's where art is that's that
 

8145
02:19:12,960 --> 02:19:14,950
guts that's where art is that's that
danger and then

8146
02:19:14,950 --> 02:19:14,960
danger and then
 

8147
02:19:14,960 --> 02:19:16,070
danger and then
the

8148
02:19:16,070 --> 02:19:16,080
the
 

8149
02:19:16,080 --> 02:19:17,669
the
alpha

8150
02:19:17,669 --> 02:19:17,679
alpha
 

8151
02:19:17,679 --> 02:19:19,349
alpha
alpha zero takes those same kind of

8152
02:19:19,349 --> 02:19:19,359
alpha zero takes those same kind of
 

8153
02:19:19,359 --> 02:19:22,230
alpha zero takes those same kind of
risks and does them even greater degree

8154
02:19:22,230 --> 02:19:22,240
risks and does them even greater degree
 

8155
02:19:22,240 --> 02:19:23,509
risks and does them even greater degree
but of course

8156
02:19:23,509 --> 02:19:23,519
but of course
 

8157
02:19:23,519 --> 02:19:26,629
but of course
it does it from a

8158
02:19:26,629 --> 02:19:26,639
it does it from a
 

8159
02:19:26,639 --> 02:19:28,709
it does it from a
well you could easily

8160
02:19:28,709 --> 02:19:28,719
well you could easily
 

8161
02:19:28,719 --> 02:19:31,349
well you could easily
uh reduce down to a

8162
02:19:31,349 --> 02:19:31,359
uh reduce down to a
 

8163
02:19:31,359 --> 02:19:32,629
uh reduce down to a
cold

8164
02:19:32,629 --> 02:19:32,639
cold
 

8165
02:19:32,639 --> 02:19:35,669
cold
calculation over patterns but

8166
02:19:35,669 --> 02:19:35,679
calculation over patterns but
 

8167
02:19:35,679 --> 02:19:37,830
calculation over patterns but
boy when you see the final result it

8168
02:19:37,830 --> 02:19:37,840
boy when you see the final result it
 

8169
02:19:37,840 --> 02:19:39,830
boy when you see the final result it
sure looks like the same kind of magic

8170
02:19:39,830 --> 02:19:39,840
sure looks like the same kind of magic
 

8171
02:19:39,840 --> 02:19:41,750
sure looks like the same kind of magic
that we see in creativity

8172
02:19:41,750 --> 02:19:41,760
that we see in creativity
 

8173
02:19:41,760 --> 02:19:43,910
that we see in creativity
uh when we see creative play on the

8174
02:19:43,910 --> 02:19:43,920
uh when we see creative play on the
 

8175
02:19:43,920 --> 02:19:46,070
uh when we see creative play on the
chessboard but the chessboard is very

8176
02:19:46,070 --> 02:19:46,080
chessboard but the chessboard is very
 

8177
02:19:46,080 --> 02:19:48,150
chessboard but the chessboard is very
limited and the question is as we get

8178
02:19:48,150 --> 02:19:48,160
limited and the question is as we get
 

8179
02:19:48,160 --> 02:19:49,830
limited and the question is as we get
better and better can we

8180
02:19:49,830 --> 02:19:49,840
better and better can we
 

8181
02:19:49,840 --> 02:19:52,389
better and better can we
do that same kind of creativity

8182
02:19:52,389 --> 02:19:52,399
do that same kind of creativity
 

8183
02:19:52,399 --> 02:19:54,070
do that same kind of creativity
in mathematics

8184
02:19:54,070 --> 02:19:54,080

and then adventuring biology psychology
 

8189
02:19:59,520 --> 02:20:02,469
and then adventuring biology psychology
and expand into more and more complex

8190
02:20:02,469 --> 02:20:02,479
and expand into more and more complex
 

8191
02:20:02,479 --> 02:20:03,910
and expand into more and more complex
systems

i was um

8194
02:20:05,349 --> 02:20:05,359
i was um
 

8195
02:20:05,359 --> 02:20:07,750
i was um
used to go running when i was a boy and

8196
02:20:07,750 --> 02:20:07,760
used to go running when i was a boy and
 

8197
02:20:07,760 --> 02:20:09,429
used to go running when i was a boy and
fell running which is say running up and

8198
02:20:09,429 --> 02:20:09,439
fell running which is say running up and
 

8199
02:20:09,439 --> 02:20:11,510
fell running which is say running up and
down mountains and i was never

8200
02:20:11,510 --> 02:20:11,520
down mountains and i was never
 

8201
02:20:11,520 --> 02:20:13,429
down mountains and i was never
particularly great at it but

8202
02:20:13,429 --> 02:20:13,439
particularly great at it but
 

8203
02:20:13,439 --> 02:20:15,110
particularly great at it but
there were some people who were

8204
02:20:15,110 --> 02:20:15,120
there were some people who were
 

8205
02:20:15,120 --> 02:20:17,510
there were some people who were
amazingly fast especially at running

8206
02:20:17,510 --> 02:20:17,520
amazingly fast especially at running
 

8207
02:20:17,520 --> 02:20:18,389
amazingly fast especially at running
down

8208
02:20:18,389 --> 02:20:18,399
down
 

8209
02:20:18,399 --> 02:20:21,030
down
uh and i i realized in trying to do this

8210
02:20:21,030 --> 02:20:21,040
uh and i i realized in trying to do this
 

8211
02:20:21,040 --> 02:20:23,349
uh and i i realized in trying to do this
that um there's

8212
02:20:23,349 --> 02:20:23,359
that um there's
 

8213
02:20:23,359 --> 02:20:25,110
that um there's
there's only really two two way there's

8214
02:20:25,110 --> 02:20:25,120
there's only really two two way there's
 

8215
02:20:25,120 --> 02:20:26,469
there's only really two two way there's
three possible ways of doing it and

8216
02:20:26,469 --> 02:20:26,479
three possible ways of doing it and
 

8217
02:20:26,479 --> 02:20:28,230
three possible ways of doing it and
there's only two that work either you go

8218
02:20:28,230 --> 02:20:28,240
there's only two that work either you go
 

8219
02:20:28,240 --> 02:20:30,550
there's only two that work either you go
extremely slowly and carefully and you

8220
02:20:30,550 --> 02:20:30,560
extremely slowly and carefully and you
 

8221
02:20:30,560 --> 02:20:32,630
extremely slowly and carefully and you
figure out okay there's a stone i'll put

8222
02:20:32,630 --> 02:20:32,640
figure out okay there's a stone i'll put
 

8223
02:20:32,640 --> 02:20:34,630
figure out okay there's a stone i'll put
my foot on this stone and then there's

8224
02:20:34,630 --> 02:20:34,640
my foot on this stone and then there's
 

8225
02:20:34,640 --> 02:20:36,550
my foot on this stone and then there's
another there's a muddy puddle i'm going

8226
02:20:36,550 --> 02:20:36,560
another there's a muddy puddle i'm going
 

8227
02:20:36,560 --> 02:20:38,309
another there's a muddy puddle i'm going
to avoid and you know it's slow it's

8228
02:20:38,309 --> 02:20:38,319
to avoid and you know it's slow it's
 

8229
02:20:38,319 --> 02:20:42,150
to avoid and you know it's slow it's
laborious you figure it out step by step

8230
02:20:42,150 --> 02:20:42,160
laborious you figure it out step by step
 

8231
02:20:42,160 --> 02:20:44,230
laborious you figure it out step by step
or you can just go incredibly fast and

8232
02:20:44,230 --> 02:20:44,240
or you can just go incredibly fast and
 

8233
02:20:44,240 --> 02:20:45,590
or you can just go incredibly fast and
you don't think about it at all the

8234
02:20:45,590 --> 02:20:45,600
you don't think about it at all the
 

8235
02:20:45,600 --> 02:20:47,429
you don't think about it at all the
entire conscious mind is shut out of it

8236
02:20:47,429 --> 02:20:47,439
entire conscious mind is shut out of it
 

8237
02:20:47,439 --> 02:20:49,270
entire conscious mind is shut out of it
and it's probably the same playing table

8238
02:20:49,270 --> 02:20:49,280
and it's probably the same playing table
 

8239
02:20:49,280 --> 02:20:50,710
and it's probably the same playing table
tennis or something there's something in

8240
02:20:50,710 --> 02:20:50,720
tennis or something there's something in
 

8241
02:20:50,720 --> 02:20:52,710
tennis or something there's something in
the mind which is doing a whole lot of

8242
02:20:52,710 --> 02:20:52,720
the mind which is doing a whole lot of
 

8243
02:20:52,720 --> 02:20:54,710
the mind which is doing a whole lot of
subconscious calculations about exactly

8244
02:20:54,710 --> 02:20:54,720
subconscious calculations about exactly
 

8245
02:20:54,720 --> 02:20:56,389
subconscious calculations about exactly
and it's amazing you can run at

8246
02:20:56,389 --> 02:20:56,399
and it's amazing you can run at
 

8247
02:20:56,399 --> 02:20:58,230
and it's amazing you can run at
astonishing speed down a hillside with

8248
02:20:58,230 --> 02:20:58,240
astonishing speed down a hillside with
 

8249
02:20:58,240 --> 02:21:00,230
astonishing speed down a hillside with
no idea how you did it at all

8250
02:21:00,230 --> 02:21:00,240
no idea how you did it at all
 

8251
02:21:00,240 --> 02:21:01,830
no idea how you did it at all
and then you panic and you think i'm

8252
02:21:01,830 --> 02:21:01,840
and then you panic and you think i'm
 

8253
02:21:01,840 --> 02:21:03,190
and then you panic and you think i'm
going to break my leg if i keep doing

8254
02:21:03,190 --> 02:21:03,200
going to break my leg if i keep doing
 

8255
02:21:03,200 --> 02:21:04,469
going to break my leg if i keep doing
this i've got to think about where i'm

8256
02:21:04,469 --> 02:21:04,479
this i've got to think about where i'm
 

8257
02:21:04,479 --> 02:21:06,150
this i've got to think about where i'm
going to put my foot so you slow down a

8258
02:21:06,150 --> 02:21:06,160
going to put my foot so you slow down a
 

8259
02:21:06,160 --> 02:21:07,429
going to put my foot so you slow down a
bit and try to bring those conscious

8260
02:21:07,429 --> 02:21:07,439
bit and try to bring those conscious
 

8261
02:21:07,439 --> 02:21:09,590
bit and try to bring those conscious
mind in and then you you do you crash

8262
02:21:09,590 --> 02:21:09,600
mind in and then you you do you crash
 

8263
02:21:09,600 --> 02:21:11,429
mind in and then you you do you crash
you can't you can you cannot think

8264
02:21:11,429 --> 02:21:11,439
you can't you can you cannot think
 

8265
02:21:11,439 --> 02:21:14,070
you can't you can you cannot think
consciously while running downhill

8266
02:21:14,070 --> 02:21:14,080
consciously while running downhill
 

8267
02:21:14,080 --> 02:21:15,670
consciously while running downhill
and so it's amazing

8268
02:21:15,670 --> 02:21:15,680
and so it's amazing
 

8269
02:21:15,680 --> 02:21:18,469
and so it's amazing
it's amazing how many calculations the

8270
02:21:18,469 --> 02:21:18,479
it's amazing how many calculations the
 

8271
02:21:18,479 --> 02:21:21,110
it's amazing how many calculations the
mind is able to make

8272
02:21:21,110 --> 02:21:21,120
mind is able to make
 

8273
02:21:21,120 --> 02:21:22,950
mind is able to make
and now the problem with playing chess

8274
02:21:22,950 --> 02:21:22,960
and now the problem with playing chess
 

8275
02:21:22,960 --> 02:21:24,309
and now the problem with playing chess
or something if you were able to make

8276
02:21:24,309 --> 02:21:24,319
or something if you were able to make
 

8277
02:21:24,319 --> 02:21:26,389
or something if you were able to make
all of those subconscious kind of

8278
02:21:26,389 --> 02:21:26,399
all of those subconscious kind of
 

8279
02:21:26,399 --> 02:21:28,389
all of those subconscious kind of
forward calculations about

8280
02:21:28,389 --> 02:21:28,399
forward calculations about
 

8281
02:21:28,399 --> 02:21:30,550
forward calculations about
what what is the likely outcome of this

8282
02:21:30,550 --> 02:21:30,560
what what is the likely outcome of this
 

8283
02:21:30,560 --> 02:21:31,830
what what is the likely outcome of this
move now

8284
02:21:31,830 --> 02:21:31,840
move now
 

8285
02:21:31,840 --> 02:21:33,670
move now
uh in the way that we can by running

8286
02:21:33,670 --> 02:21:33,680
uh in the way that we can by running
 

8287
02:21:33,680 --> 02:21:35,349
uh in the way that we can by running
down a hillside or something is it you

8288
02:21:35,349 --> 02:21:35,359
down a hillside or something is it you
 

8289
02:21:35,359 --> 02:21:37,270
down a hillside or something is it you
know it's partly about what we have

8290
02:21:37,270 --> 02:21:37,280
know it's partly about what we have
 

8291
02:21:37,280 --> 02:21:38,950
know it's partly about what we have
adapted to do it's partly about the

8292
02:21:38,950 --> 02:21:38,960
adapted to do it's partly about the
 

8293
02:21:38,960 --> 02:21:40,389
adapted to do it's partly about the
reality of the world that we're in

8294
02:21:40,389 --> 02:21:40,399
reality of the world that we're in
 

8295
02:21:40,399 --> 02:21:41,990
reality of the world that we're in
running fast downhill is something that

8296
02:21:41,990 --> 02:21:42,000
running fast downhill is something that
 

8297
02:21:42,000 --> 02:21:43,830
running fast downhill is something that
we better be bloody good at otherwise

8298
02:21:43,830 --> 02:21:43,840
we better be bloody good at otherwise
 

8299
02:21:43,840 --> 02:21:45,990
we better be bloody good at otherwise
we're going to be eaten um

8300
02:21:45,990 --> 02:21:46,000
we're going to be eaten um
 

8301
02:21:46,000 --> 02:21:47,670
we're going to be eaten um
whereas whereas

8302
02:21:47,670 --> 02:21:47,680
whereas whereas
 

8303
02:21:47,680 --> 02:21:49,429
whereas whereas
trying to calculate

8304
02:21:49,429 --> 02:21:49,439
trying to calculate
 

8305
02:21:49,439 --> 02:21:51,750
trying to calculate
multiple multiple moves into the future

8306
02:21:51,750 --> 02:21:51,760
multiple multiple moves into the future
 

8307
02:21:51,760 --> 02:21:53,349
multiple multiple moves into the future
is not something we've ever been called

8308
02:21:53,349 --> 02:21:53,359
is not something we've ever been called
 

8309
02:21:53,359 --> 02:21:55,270
is not something we've ever been called
on to do two or three four moves into

8310
02:21:55,270 --> 02:21:55,280
on to do two or three four moves into
 

8311
02:21:55,280 --> 02:21:57,510
on to do two or three four moves into
the future is quite enough for most of

8312
02:21:57,510 --> 02:21:57,520
the future is quite enough for most of
 

8313
02:21:57,520 --> 02:22:00,150
the future is quite enough for most of
us most of the time

8314
02:22:00,150 --> 02:22:00,160
us most of the time
 

8315
02:22:00,160 --> 02:22:01,030
us most of the time
yeah

8316
02:22:01,030 --> 02:22:01,040
yeah
 

8317
02:22:01,040 --> 02:22:03,510
yeah
yeah so the yeah just solving chess may

8318
02:22:03,510 --> 02:22:03,520
yeah so the yeah just solving chess may
 

8319
02:22:03,520 --> 02:22:05,510
yeah so the yeah just solving chess may
not um

8320
02:22:05,510 --> 02:22:05,520
not um
 

8321
02:22:05,520 --> 02:22:09,190
not um
we may not be as far towards solving the

8322
02:22:09,190 --> 02:22:09,200
we may not be as far towards solving the
 

8323
02:22:09,200 --> 02:22:12,950
we may not be as far towards solving the
problem of uh downhill running

8324
02:22:12,950 --> 02:22:12,960
problem of uh downhill running
 

8325
02:22:12,960 --> 02:22:15,590
problem of uh downhill running
as we might think just because we solved

8326
02:22:15,590 --> 02:22:15,600
as we might think just because we solved
 

8327
02:22:15,600 --> 02:22:17,270
as we might think just because we solved
chess

8328
02:22:17,270 --> 02:22:17,280
chess
 

8329
02:22:17,280 --> 02:22:19,590
chess
still it's beautiful to see

8330
02:22:19,590 --> 02:22:19,600
still it's beautiful to see
 

8331
02:22:19,600 --> 02:22:23,270
still it's beautiful to see
creativity humans create machines

8332
02:22:23,270 --> 02:22:23,280
creativity humans create machines
 

8333
02:22:23,280 --> 02:22:25,830
creativity humans create machines
they're able to create art

8334
02:22:25,830 --> 02:22:25,840
they're able to create art
 

8335
02:22:25,840 --> 02:22:28,150
they're able to create art
and art on the chessboard and art

8336
02:22:28,150 --> 02:22:28,160
and art on the chessboard and art
 

8337
02:22:28,160 --> 02:22:29,270
and art on the chessboard and art
otherwise

8338
02:22:29,270 --> 02:22:29,280
otherwise
 

8339
02:22:29,280 --> 02:22:31,750
otherwise
who knows how far that takes us

8340
02:22:31,750 --> 02:22:31,760
who knows how far that takes us
 

8341
02:22:31,760 --> 02:22:35,190
who knows how far that takes us
so i mentioned andre carpathi earlier

8342
02:22:35,190 --> 02:22:35,200
so i mentioned andre carpathi earlier
 

8343
02:22:35,200 --> 02:22:37,349
so i mentioned andre carpathi earlier
him and i are big fans of yours if

8344
02:22:37,349 --> 02:22:37,359
him and i are big fans of yours if
 

8345
02:22:37,359 --> 02:22:39,590
him and i are big fans of yours if
you're taking votes his suggestion was

8346
02:22:39,590 --> 02:22:39,600
you're taking votes his suggestion was
 

8347
02:22:39,600 --> 02:22:41,349
you're taking votes his suggestion was
you should write your next book on the

8348
02:22:41,349 --> 02:22:41,359
you should write your next book on the
 

8349
02:22:41,359 --> 02:22:43,429
you should write your next book on the
fermi paradox

8350
02:22:43,429 --> 02:22:43,439
fermi paradox
 

8351
02:22:43,439 --> 02:22:46,469
fermi paradox
so let me ask you on the topic of uh

8352
02:22:46,469 --> 02:22:46,479
so let me ask you on the topic of uh
 

8353
02:22:46,479 --> 02:22:48,950
so let me ask you on the topic of uh
alien life

8354
02:22:48,950 --> 02:22:48,960
alien life
 

8355
02:22:48,960 --> 02:22:50,389
alien life
since we've been talking about life and

8356
02:22:50,389 --> 02:22:50,399
since we've been talking about life and
 

8357
02:22:50,399 --> 02:22:53,190
since we've been talking about life and
we're a kind of aliens

8358
02:22:53,190 --> 02:22:53,200
we're a kind of aliens
 

8359
02:22:53,200 --> 02:22:54,950
we're a kind of aliens
how many alien civilizations are out

8360
02:22:54,950 --> 02:22:54,960
how many alien civilizations are out
 

8361
02:22:54,960 --> 02:22:58,070
how many alien civilizations are out
there do you think

8362
02:22:58,070 --> 02:22:58,080

 

8363
02:22:58,080 --> 02:22:59,990

well the universe is very big

8364
02:22:59,990 --> 02:23:00,000
well the universe is very big
 

8365
02:23:00,000 --> 02:23:01,429
well the universe is very big
so some

8366
02:23:01,429 --> 02:23:01,439
so some
 

8367
02:23:01,439 --> 02:23:03,429
so some
but not as many as most people would

8368
02:23:03,429 --> 02:23:03,439
but not as many as most people would
 

8369
02:23:03,439 --> 02:23:05,270
but not as many as most people would
like to think is my view because the

8370
02:23:05,270 --> 02:23:05,280
like to think is my view because the
 

8371
02:23:05,280 --> 02:23:07,830
like to think is my view because the
idea that

8372
02:23:07,830 --> 02:23:07,840
idea that
 

8373
02:23:07,840 --> 02:23:12,070
idea that
that there is a trajectory going from

8374
02:23:12,070 --> 02:23:12,080

 

8375
02:23:12,080 --> 02:23:13,990

simple simple cellular life like

8376
02:23:13,990 --> 02:23:14,000
simple simple cellular life like
 

8377
02:23:14,000 --> 02:23:17,190
simple simple cellular life like
bacteria all the way through to humans

8378
02:23:17,190 --> 02:23:17,200
bacteria all the way through to humans
 

8379
02:23:17,200 --> 02:23:19,110
bacteria all the way through to humans
it seems to me there's some big gaps

8380
02:23:19,110 --> 02:23:19,120
it seems to me there's some big gaps
 

8381
02:23:19,120 --> 02:23:21,590
it seems to me there's some big gaps
along that way the the eukaryotic cell

8382
02:23:21,590 --> 02:23:21,600
along that way the the eukaryotic cell
 

8383
02:23:21,600 --> 02:23:23,750
along that way the the eukaryotic cell
the the complex cell that we have is is

8384
02:23:23,750 --> 02:23:23,760
the the complex cell that we have is is
 

8385
02:23:23,760 --> 02:23:25,429
the the complex cell that we have is is
the biggest of them but also

8386
02:23:25,429 --> 02:23:25,439
the biggest of them but also
 

8387
02:23:25,439 --> 02:23:27,910
the biggest of them but also
photosynthesis is another the other

8388
02:23:27,910 --> 02:23:27,920
photosynthesis is another the other
 

8389
02:23:27,920 --> 02:23:30,230
photosynthesis is another the other
another interesting gap is a long gap

8390
02:23:30,230 --> 02:23:30,240
another interesting gap is a long gap
 

8391
02:23:30,240 --> 02:23:32,710
another interesting gap is a long gap
from from the origin of the eukaryotic

8392
02:23:32,710 --> 02:23:32,720
from from the origin of the eukaryotic
 

8393
02:23:32,720 --> 02:23:34,950
from from the origin of the eukaryotic
cell to the first animals that was about

8394
02:23:34,950 --> 02:23:34,960
cell to the first animals that was about
 

8395
02:23:34,960 --> 02:23:36,389
cell to the first animals that was about
a billion years

8396
02:23:36,389 --> 02:23:36,399
a billion years
 

8397
02:23:36,399 --> 02:23:38,070
a billion years
uh maybe more than that

8398
02:23:38,070 --> 02:23:38,080
uh maybe more than that
 

8399
02:23:38,080 --> 02:23:41,349
uh maybe more than that
um a long delay in when oxygen began to

8400
02:23:41,349 --> 02:23:41,359
um a long delay in when oxygen began to
 

8401
02:23:41,359 --> 02:23:43,349
um a long delay in when oxygen began to
accumulate in the atmosphere so from the

8402
02:23:43,349 --> 02:23:43,359
accumulate in the atmosphere so from the
 

8403
02:23:43,359 --> 02:23:45,030
accumulate in the atmosphere so from the
first appearance of oxygen in the great

8404
02:23:45,030 --> 02:23:45,040
first appearance of oxygen in the great
 

8405
02:23:45,040 --> 02:23:46,870
first appearance of oxygen in the great
oxidation event who were enough for

8406
02:23:46,870 --> 02:23:46,880
oxidation event who were enough for
 

8407
02:23:46,880 --> 02:23:48,550
oxidation event who were enough for
animals to respire

8408
02:23:48,550 --> 02:23:48,560
animals to respire
 

8409
02:23:48,560 --> 02:23:51,110
animals to respire
it was close to two billion years

8410
02:23:51,110 --> 02:23:51,120
it was close to two billion years
 

8411
02:23:51,120 --> 02:23:52,070
it was close to two billion years
um

8412
02:23:52,070 --> 02:23:52,080
um
 

8413
02:23:52,080 --> 02:23:54,389
um
why so long it seems to be planetary

8414
02:23:54,389 --> 02:23:54,399
why so long it seems to be planetary
 

8415
02:23:54,399 --> 02:23:56,230
why so long it seems to be planetary
factors it seems to be geology as much

8416
02:23:56,230 --> 02:23:56,240
factors it seems to be geology as much
 

8417
02:23:56,240 --> 02:23:57,750
factors it seems to be geology as much
as in anything else and we don't really

8418
02:23:57,750 --> 02:23:57,760
as in anything else and we don't really
 

8419
02:23:57,760 --> 02:23:59,030
as in anything else and we don't really
know

8420
02:23:59,030 --> 02:23:59,040
know
 

8421
02:23:59,040 --> 02:24:00,630
know
what was going on

8422
02:24:00,630 --> 02:24:00,640
what was going on
 

8423
02:24:00,640 --> 02:24:02,630
what was going on
so the idea that there's a kind of an

8424
02:24:02,630 --> 02:24:02,640
so the idea that there's a kind of an
 

8425
02:24:02,640 --> 02:24:04,230
so the idea that there's a kind of an
inevitable

8426
02:24:04,230 --> 02:24:04,240
inevitable
 

8427
02:24:04,240 --> 02:24:06,150
inevitable
march towards uh

8428
02:24:06,150 --> 02:24:06,160
march towards uh
 

8429
02:24:06,160 --> 02:24:09,429
march towards uh
complexity and and um

8430
02:24:09,429 --> 02:24:09,439
complexity and and um
 

8431
02:24:09,439 --> 02:24:12,070
complexity and and um
sentient life i don't think he's right

8432
02:24:12,070 --> 02:24:12,080
sentient life i don't think he's right
 

8433
02:24:12,080 --> 02:24:13,510
sentient life i don't think he's right
doesn't not to say it's not going to

8434
02:24:13,510 --> 02:24:13,520
doesn't not to say it's not going to
 

8435
02:24:13,520 --> 02:24:14,469
doesn't not to say it's not going to
happen

8436
02:24:14,469 --> 02:24:14,479
happen
 

8437
02:24:14,479 --> 02:24:16,550
happen
but i think it's not going to happen

8438
02:24:16,550 --> 02:24:16,560
but i think it's not going to happen
 

8439
02:24:16,560 --> 02:24:17,510
but i think it's not going to happen
often

8440
02:24:17,510 --> 02:24:17,520
often
 

8441
02:24:17,520 --> 02:24:20,309
often
so if you think of earth given the

8442
02:24:20,309 --> 02:24:20,319
so if you think of earth given the
 

8443
02:24:20,319 --> 02:24:22,230
so if you think of earth given the
geological constraints and all that kind

8444
02:24:22,230 --> 02:24:22,240
geological constraints and all that kind
 

8445
02:24:22,240 --> 02:24:25,190
geological constraints and all that kind
of stuff

8446
02:24:25,190 --> 02:24:25,200

 

8447
02:24:25,200 --> 02:24:27,510

do you have a sense that life complex

8448
02:24:27,510 --> 02:24:27,520
do you have a sense that life complex
 

8449
02:24:27,520 --> 02:24:29,429
do you have a sense that life complex
life intelligent life happen really

8450
02:24:29,429 --> 02:24:29,439
life intelligent life happen really
 

8451
02:24:29,439 --> 02:24:31,590
life intelligent life happen really
quickly on earth over the long

8452
02:24:31,590 --> 02:24:31,600
quickly on earth over the long
 

8453
02:24:31,600 --> 02:24:32,469
quickly on earth over the long
so

8454
02:24:32,469 --> 02:24:32,479
so
 

8455
02:24:32,479 --> 02:24:35,030
so
just just to get a sense of

8456
02:24:35,030 --> 02:24:35,040
just just to get a sense of
 

8457
02:24:35,040 --> 02:24:36,870
just just to get a sense of
are you more sort of saying that it's

8458
02:24:36,870 --> 02:24:36,880
are you more sort of saying that it's
 

8459
02:24:36,880 --> 02:24:39,270
are you more sort of saying that it's
very unlikely to get the kind of

8460
02:24:39,270 --> 02:24:39,280
very unlikely to get the kind of
 

8461
02:24:39,280 --> 02:24:42,710
very unlikely to get the kind of
conditions required to create humans or

8462
02:24:42,710 --> 02:24:42,720
conditions required to create humans or
 

8463
02:24:42,720 --> 02:24:44,790
conditions required to create humans or
is it even if you have the condition

8464
02:24:44,790 --> 02:24:44,800
is it even if you have the condition
 

8465
02:24:44,800 --> 02:24:47,030
is it even if you have the condition
it's just statistically difficult i

8466
02:24:47,030 --> 02:24:47,040
it's just statistically difficult i
 

8467
02:24:47,040 --> 02:24:49,429
it's just statistically difficult i
think the i mean the problem the single

8468
02:24:49,429 --> 02:24:49,439
think the i mean the problem the single
 

8469
02:24:49,439 --> 02:24:50,870
think the i mean the problem the single
great problem at the center of all of

8470
02:24:50,870 --> 02:24:50,880
great problem at the center of all of
 

8471
02:24:50,880 --> 02:24:52,389
great problem at the center of all of
that to my mind is the origin of the

8472
02:24:52,389 --> 02:24:52,399
that to my mind is the origin of the
 

8473
02:24:52,399 --> 02:24:54,150
that to my mind is the origin of the
eukaryotic cell which happened once and

8474
02:24:54,150 --> 02:24:54,160
eukaryotic cell which happened once and
 

8475
02:24:54,160 --> 02:24:55,590
eukaryotic cell which happened once and
without eukaryotes nothing else would

8476
02:24:55,590 --> 02:24:55,600
without eukaryotes nothing else would
 

8477
02:24:55,600 --> 02:24:56,630
without eukaryotes nothing else would
have happened

8478
02:24:56,630 --> 02:24:56,640
have happened
 

8479
02:24:56,640 --> 02:24:58,790
have happened
and and that is something that

8480
02:24:58,790 --> 02:24:58,800
and and that is something that
 

8481
02:24:58,800 --> 02:25:00,389
and and that is something that
that's because you're saying it's super

8482
02:25:00,389 --> 02:25:00,399
that's because you're saying it's super
 

8483
02:25:00,399 --> 02:25:03,349
that's because you're saying it's super
important the eukaryotes but i'm saying

8484
02:25:03,349 --> 02:25:03,359
important the eukaryotes but i'm saying
 

8485
02:25:03,359 --> 02:25:05,030
important the eukaryotes but i'm saying
tantamount to saying that it is

8486
02:25:05,030 --> 02:25:05,040
tantamount to saying that it is
 

8487
02:25:05,040 --> 02:25:06,870
tantamount to saying that it is
impossible to build something as complex

8488
02:25:06,870 --> 02:25:06,880
impossible to build something as complex
 

8489
02:25:06,880 --> 02:25:09,190
impossible to build something as complex
as a human being from bacterial cells i

8490
02:25:09,190 --> 02:25:09,200
as a human being from bacterial cells i
 

8491
02:25:09,200 --> 02:25:10,950
as a human being from bacterial cells i
totally agree in some deep fundamental

8492
02:25:10,950 --> 02:25:10,960
totally agree in some deep fundamental
 

8493
02:25:10,960 --> 02:25:13,270
totally agree in some deep fundamental
way but it's just like a one cell going

8494
02:25:13,270 --> 02:25:13,280
way but it's just like a one cell going
 

8495
02:25:13,280 --> 02:25:14,630
way but it's just like a one cell going
inside another

8496
02:25:14,630 --> 02:25:14,640
inside another
 

8497
02:25:14,640 --> 02:25:16,630
inside another
it's not so difficult to get to work

8498
02:25:16,630 --> 02:25:16,640
it's not so difficult to get to work
 

8499
02:25:16,640 --> 02:25:18,309
it's not so difficult to get to work
right like

8500
02:25:18,309 --> 02:25:18,319
right like
 

8501
02:25:18,319 --> 02:25:21,030
right like
well again it happened once

8502
02:25:21,030 --> 02:25:21,040
well again it happened once
 

8503
02:25:21,040 --> 02:25:22,309
well again it happened once
um and

8504
02:25:22,309 --> 02:25:22,319
um and
 

8505
02:25:22,319 --> 02:25:25,270
um and
if you think about if you if you think

8506
02:25:25,270 --> 02:25:25,280
if you think about if you if you think
 

8507
02:25:25,280 --> 02:25:27,270
if you think about if you if you think
i mean i'm in a minority view in this

8508
02:25:27,270 --> 02:25:27,280
i mean i'm in a minority view in this
 

8509
02:25:27,280 --> 02:25:28,870
i mean i'm in a minority view in this
position most biologists probably

8510
02:25:28,870 --> 02:25:28,880
position most biologists probably
 

8511
02:25:28,880 --> 02:25:30,950
position most biologists probably
wouldn't agree with me anyway but if you

8512
02:25:30,950 --> 02:25:30,960
wouldn't agree with me anyway but if you
 

8513
02:25:30,960 --> 02:25:32,950
wouldn't agree with me anyway but if you
think about the the starting point we've

8514
02:25:32,950 --> 02:25:32,960
think about the the starting point we've
 

8515
02:25:32,960 --> 02:25:35,349
think about the the starting point we've
we've got a simple cell it's an archaeal

8516
02:25:35,349 --> 02:25:35,359
we've got a simple cell it's an archaeal
 

8517
02:25:35,359 --> 02:25:36,870
we've got a simple cell it's an archaeal
cell we can be fairly sure about that so

8518
02:25:36,870 --> 02:25:36,880
cell we can be fairly sure about that so
 

8519
02:25:36,880 --> 02:25:38,950
cell we can be fairly sure about that so
it looks a lot like a bacterium

8520
02:25:38,950 --> 02:25:38,960
it looks a lot like a bacterium
 

8521
02:25:38,960 --> 02:25:40,630
it looks a lot like a bacterium
but is in fact from this other other

8522
02:25:40,630 --> 02:25:40,640
but is in fact from this other other
 

8523
02:25:40,640 --> 02:25:43,349
but is in fact from this other other
domain of life so it looks a lot like a

8524
02:25:43,349 --> 02:25:43,359
domain of life so it looks a lot like a
 

8525
02:25:43,359 --> 02:25:45,190
domain of life so it looks a lot like a
bacterial cell that means it doesn't

8526
02:25:45,190 --> 02:25:45,200
bacterial cell that means it doesn't
 

8527
02:25:45,200 --> 02:25:47,349
bacterial cell that means it doesn't
have anything it doesn't have a nucleus

8528
02:25:47,349 --> 02:25:47,359
have anything it doesn't have a nucleus
 

8529
02:25:47,359 --> 02:25:48,950
have anything it doesn't have a nucleus
it doesn't really have

8530
02:25:48,950 --> 02:25:48,960
it doesn't really have
 

8531
02:25:48,960 --> 02:25:50,790
it doesn't really have
complex endo membrane it has it has a

8532
02:25:50,790 --> 02:25:50,800
complex endo membrane it has it has a
 

8533
02:25:50,800 --> 02:25:52,550
complex endo membrane it has it has a
little bit of stuff but not not that

8534
02:25:52,550 --> 02:25:52,560
little bit of stuff but not not that
 

8535
02:25:52,560 --> 02:25:53,590
little bit of stuff but not not that
much

8536
02:25:53,590 --> 02:25:53,600
much
 

8537
02:25:53,600 --> 02:25:56,070
much
and it takes up an endless inbound

8538
02:25:56,070 --> 02:25:56,080
and it takes up an endless inbound
 

8539
02:25:56,080 --> 02:25:57,670
and it takes up an endless inbound
so what happens

8540
02:25:57,670 --> 02:25:57,680
so what happens
 

8541
02:25:57,680 --> 02:25:58,710
so what happens
next

8542
02:25:58,710 --> 02:25:58,720
next
 

8543
02:25:58,720 --> 02:26:00,870
next
and the answer is basically everything

8544
02:26:00,870 --> 02:26:00,880
and the answer is basically everything
 

8545
02:26:00,880 --> 02:26:02,550
and the answer is basically everything
to do with complexity

8546
02:26:02,550 --> 02:26:02,560
to do with complexity
 

8547
02:26:02,560 --> 02:26:07,030
to do with complexity
to me there's a beautiful paradox here

8548
02:26:07,030 --> 02:26:07,040

 

8549
02:26:07,040 --> 02:26:10,469

plants and animals and fungi

8550
02:26:10,469 --> 02:26:10,479
plants and animals and fungi
 

8551
02:26:10,479 --> 02:26:13,750
plants and animals and fungi
all have exactly the same type of cell

8552
02:26:13,750 --> 02:26:13,760
all have exactly the same type of cell
 

8553
02:26:13,760 --> 02:26:15,670
all have exactly the same type of cell
but they all have really different ways

8554
02:26:15,670 --> 02:26:15,680
but they all have really different ways
 

8555
02:26:15,680 --> 02:26:19,429
but they all have really different ways
of living so a plant cell

8556
02:26:19,429 --> 02:26:19,439
of living so a plant cell
 

8557
02:26:19,439 --> 02:26:21,270
of living so a plant cell
it's photosynthetic

8558
02:26:21,270 --> 02:26:21,280
it's photosynthetic
 

8559
02:26:21,280 --> 02:26:23,590
it's photosynthetic
they started out as algae in the oceans

8560
02:26:23,590 --> 02:26:23,600
they started out as algae in the oceans
 

8561
02:26:23,600 --> 02:26:25,590
they started out as algae in the oceans
and so on so think of algal blooms

8562
02:26:25,590 --> 02:26:25,600
and so on so think of algal blooms
 

8563
02:26:25,600 --> 02:26:27,110
and so on so think of algal blooms
single cell things you know the the

8564
02:26:27,110 --> 02:26:27,120
single cell things you know the the
 

8565
02:26:27,120 --> 02:26:28,309
single cell things you know the the

02:26:29,590 --> 02:26:29,600
uh
 

8569
02:26:29,600 --> 02:26:31,590
uh
the basic cell structure that it's built

8570
02:26:31,590 --> 02:26:31,600
the basic cell structure that it's built
 

8571
02:26:31,600 --> 02:26:33,830
the basic cell structure that it's built
from is exactly the same with a couple

8572
02:26:33,830 --> 02:26:33,840
from is exactly the same with a couple
 

8573
02:26:33,840 --> 02:26:35,510
from is exactly the same with a couple
of small differences it's got

8574
02:26:35,510 --> 02:26:35,520
of small differences it's got
 

8575
02:26:35,520 --> 02:26:37,190
of small differences it's got
chloroplasts as well it's got a vacuole

8576
02:26:37,190 --> 02:26:37,200

8577
02:26:37,200 --> 02:26:38,950
chloroplasts as well it's got a vacuole
it's got a cell wall but that's about it

8578
02:26:38,950 --> 02:26:38,960
it's got a cell wall but that's about it
 

8579
02:26:38,960 --> 02:26:40,389
it's got a cell wall but that's about it
pretty much everything else is exactly

8580
02:26:40,389 --> 02:26:40,399
pretty much everything else is exactly
 

8581
02:26:40,399 --> 02:26:42,070
pretty much everything else is exactly
the same in a plant cell and an animal

8582
02:26:42,070 --> 02:26:42,080
the same in a plant cell and an animal
 

8583
02:26:42,080 --> 02:26:43,510
the same in a plant cell and an animal
cell

and yet the ways of life are completely
 

8587
02:26:45,359 --> 02:26:47,429
and yet the ways of life are completely
different so this these this cell

8588
02:26:47,429 --> 02:26:47,439

mycelium so

8606
02:27:04,790 --> 02:27:04,800
mycelium so
 

8607
02:27:04,800 --> 02:27:06,469
mycelium so
they all have the same underlying cell

8631
02:27:26,560 --> 02:27:28,870

could be that there's a huge fluke about
 

8633
02:27:28,880 --> 02:27:30,389
could be that there's a huge fluke about
it and it's almost certain to go wrong

8634
02:27:30,389 --> 02:27:30,399
it and it's almost certain to go wrong
 

8635

in just about every case possible that

in just about every case possible that

and it simply doesn't work out so maybe

8642
02:27:39,510 --> 02:27:39,520
and it simply doesn't work out so maybe
 

8643
02:27:39,520 --> 02:27:40,870
and it simply doesn't work out so maybe
it happened millions of times and it

8644
02:27:40,870 --> 02:27:40,880
it happened millions of times and it
 

8645
02:27:40,880 --> 02:27:42,389
it happened millions of times and it
went wrong every time or maybe it only

went wrong every time or maybe it only
 

8647
02:27:42,399 --> 02:27:43,910

8649
02:27:43,920 --> 02:27:45,429

02:27:45,439 --> 02:27:47,510

we just got really lucky in that one

02:27:58,720 --> 02:28:00,950
leap
like we got so do you have a sense that

8666
02:28:00,950 --> 02:28:00,960
like we got so do you have a sense that
 

8667
02:28:00,960 --> 02:28:04,550
like we got so do you have a sense that
our galaxy for example has just

8668
02:28:04,550 --> 02:28:04,560
our galaxy for example has just
 

8669
02:28:04,560 --> 02:28:06,870
our galaxy for example has just
maybe millions of planets with bacteria

8670
02:28:06,870 --> 02:28:06,880
maybe millions of planets with bacteria
 

8671
02:28:06,880 --> 02:28:09,510
maybe millions of planets with bacteria
living on it i would expect billions

8672
02:28:09,510 --> 02:28:09,520
living on it i would expect billions
 

8673
02:28:09,520 --> 02:28:10,950
living on it i would expect billions
tens of billions of planets with

8674
02:28:10,950 --> 02:28:10,960
tens of billions of planets with
 

8675
02:28:10,960 --> 02:28:12,550
tens of billions of planets with
bacteria living on it practically i

8676
02:28:12,550 --> 02:28:12,560
bacteria living on it practically i
 

8677
02:28:12,560 --> 02:28:14,389
bacteria living on it practically i
would i would i mean there's probably

8678
02:28:14,389 --> 02:28:14,399
would i would i mean there's probably
 

8679
02:28:14,399 --> 02:28:17,510
would i would i mean there's probably
what five to ten planets per star

8680
02:28:17,510 --> 02:28:17,520
what five to ten planets per star
 

8681
02:28:17,520 --> 02:28:19,349
what five to ten planets per star
of which i would hope that at least one

8682
02:28:19,349 --> 02:28:19,359
of which i would hope that at least one
 

8683
02:28:19,359 --> 02:28:21,750
of which i would hope that at least one
would have bacteria on

8684
02:28:21,750 --> 02:28:21,760
would have bacteria on
 

8685
02:28:21,760 --> 02:28:24,309
would have bacteria on
so i expect bacteria to be very common

8686
02:28:24,309 --> 02:28:24,319
so i expect bacteria to be very common
 

8687
02:28:24,319 --> 02:28:26,710
so i expect bacteria to be very common
i i simply can't put a number otherwise

8688
02:28:26,710 --> 02:28:26,720
i i simply can't put a number otherwise
 

8689
02:28:26,720 --> 02:28:28,630
i i simply can't put a number otherwise
i mean i expect it will happen elsewhere

8690
02:28:28,630 --> 02:28:28,640
i mean i expect it will happen elsewhere
 

8691
02:28:28,640 --> 02:28:29,990
i mean i expect it will happen elsewhere
it's not that i think we're living in a

8692
02:28:29,990 --> 02:28:30,000
it's not that i think we're living in a
 

8693
02:28:30,000 --> 02:28:32,550
it's not that i think we're living in a
completely empty universe that's so fast

8694
02:28:32,550 --> 02:28:32,560
completely empty universe that's so fast
 

8695
02:28:32,560 --> 02:28:34,389
completely empty universe that's so fast
but i think that it's not going to

8696
02:28:34,389 --> 02:28:34,399
but i think that it's not going to
 

8697
02:28:34,399 --> 02:28:36,790
but i think that it's not going to
happen inevitably and there's something

8698
02:28:36,790 --> 02:28:36,800
happen inevitably and there's something
 

8699
02:28:36,800 --> 02:28:38,389
happen inevitably and there's something
you know it wasn't that's not the only

8700
02:28:38,389 --> 02:28:38,399
you know it wasn't that's not the only
 

8701
02:28:38,399 --> 02:28:40,469
you know it wasn't that's not the only
problem with uh with with

complex life on earth i mentioned oxygen

8704
02:28:42,469 --> 02:28:42,479
complex life on earth i mentioned oxygen
 

8705
02:28:42,479 --> 02:28:44,309
complex life on earth i mentioned oxygen
animals and so on as well and even

8706
02:28:44,309 --> 02:28:44,319
animals and so on as well and even
 

8707
02:28:44,319 --> 02:28:46,230
animals and so on as well and even
humans we came along very late you go

8708
02:28:46,230 --> 02:28:46,240
humans we came along very late you go
 

8709
02:28:46,240 --> 02:28:48,070
humans we came along very late you go
back five million years and you know

8710
02:28:48,070 --> 02:28:48,080
back five million years and you know
 

8711
02:28:48,080 --> 02:28:49,510
back five million years and you know
would we be that impressed if we came

8712
02:28:49,510 --> 02:28:49,520
would we be that impressed if we came
 

8713
02:28:49,520 --> 02:28:51,990
would we be that impressed if we came
across a planet full of giraffes

across a planet full of giraffes
 

8715
02:28:52,000 --> 02:28:53,750
across a planet full of giraffes
i mean you'd think hey there's life here

8716
02:28:53,750 --> 02:28:53,760
i mean you'd think hey there's life here
 

8717
02:28:53,760 --> 02:28:55,670
i mean you'd think hey there's life here
and there's a nice planet to colonize or

8718
02:28:55,670 --> 02:28:55,680
and there's a nice planet to colonize or
 

8719
02:28:55,680 --> 02:28:57,670
and there's a nice planet to colonize or
something we wouldn't think oh let's try

8720
02:28:57,670 --> 02:28:57,680
something we wouldn't think oh let's try
 

8721
02:28:57,680 --> 02:28:58,870
something we wouldn't think oh let's try
and have a conversation with this

8722
02:28:58,870 --> 02:28:58,880
and have a conversation with this
 

8723
02:28:58,880 --> 02:29:00,230
and have a conversation with this
giraffe

8724

yeah i'm not sure what exactly we would

8726
02:29:02,950 --> 02:29:02,960
yeah i'm not sure what exactly we would
 

8727
02:29:02,960 --> 02:29:04,070
yeah i'm not sure what exactly we would
think

8728
02:29:04,070 --> 02:29:04,080
think
 

8729
02:29:04,080 --> 02:29:06,950
think
i'm not exactly sure what makes humans

8730
02:29:06,950 --> 02:29:06,960
i'm not exactly sure what makes humans
 

8731
02:29:06,960 --> 02:29:09,910
i'm not exactly sure what makes humans
so interesting from an alien perspective

8732
02:29:09,910 --> 02:29:09,920
so interesting from an alien perspective
 

8733
02:29:09,920 --> 02:29:11,910
so interesting from an alien perspective
or how they would notice i'll talk to

8734
02:29:11,910 --> 02:29:11,920
or how they would notice i'll talk to
 

8735
02:29:11,920 --> 02:29:13,190
or how they would notice i'll talk to
you about cities too because that's an

8736
02:29:13,190 --> 02:29:13,200
you about cities too because that's an
 

8737
02:29:13,200 --> 02:29:15,110
you about cities too because that's an
interesting perspective of uh how to

8738
02:29:15,110 --> 02:29:15,120
interesting perspective of uh how to
 

8739
02:29:15,120 --> 02:29:18,070
interesting perspective of uh how to
look at human civilization

8740
02:29:18,070 --> 02:29:18,080
look at human civilization
 

8741
02:29:18,080 --> 02:29:19,910
look at human civilization
but your sense i mean of course you

8742
02:29:19,910 --> 02:29:19,920
but your sense i mean of course you
 

8743
02:29:19,920 --> 02:29:23,349
but your sense i mean of course you
don't know but it's an interesting

8744
02:29:23,349 --> 02:29:23,359
don't know but it's an interesting
 

8745
02:29:23,359 --> 02:29:25,590
don't know but it's an interesting
world it's an interesting galaxy it's an

8746
02:29:25,590 --> 02:29:25,600
world it's an interesting galaxy it's an
 

8747
02:29:25,600 --> 02:29:27,750
world it's an interesting galaxy it's an
interesting universe to live in that's

8748
02:29:27,750 --> 02:29:27,760
interesting universe to live in that's
 

8749
02:29:27,760 --> 02:29:29,110
interesting universe to live in that's
just like

8750
02:29:29,110 --> 02:29:29,120
just like
 

8751
02:29:29,120 --> 02:29:31,110
just like
every sun

8752
02:29:31,110 --> 02:29:31,120
every sun
 

8753
02:29:31,120 --> 02:29:33,429
every sun
like 90 percent

8754
02:29:33,429 --> 02:29:33,439
like 90 percent
 

8755
02:29:33,439 --> 02:29:34,950
like 90 percent
of uh

of uh
 

8757
02:29:34,960 --> 02:29:36,870
of uh
solar systems

8758
02:29:36,870 --> 02:29:36,880
solar systems
 

8759
02:29:36,880 --> 02:29:39,429
solar systems
have bacteria in it

8760
02:29:39,429 --> 02:29:39,439
have bacteria in it
 

8761
02:29:39,439 --> 02:29:42,150
have bacteria in it
like imagine that world

8762
02:29:42,150 --> 02:29:42,160
like imagine that world
 

8763
02:29:42,160 --> 02:29:43,429
like imagine that world
and

8764
02:29:43,429 --> 02:29:43,439
and
 

8765
02:29:43,439 --> 02:29:46,070
and
the galaxy maybe has

8766
02:29:46,070 --> 02:29:46,080
the galaxy maybe has
 

8767
02:29:46,080 --> 02:29:48,790
the galaxy maybe has
just a handful if not one

8768
02:29:48,790 --> 02:29:48,800
just a handful if not one
 

8769
02:29:48,800 --> 02:29:51,110
just a handful if not one
intelligent civilization

8770
02:29:51,110 --> 02:29:51,120
intelligent civilization
 

8771
02:29:51,120 --> 02:29:53,670
intelligent civilization
that's a wild world and so wow i didn't

8772
02:29:53,670 --> 02:29:53,680
that's a wild world and so wow i didn't
 

8773
02:29:53,680 --> 02:29:55,910
that's a wild world and so wow i didn't
even even think about that world there's

8774
02:29:55,910 --> 02:29:55,920
even even think about that world there's
 

8775
02:29:55,920 --> 02:29:57,429
even even think about that world there's
a kind of

8776
02:29:57,429 --> 02:29:57,439
a kind of
 

8777
02:29:57,439 --> 02:29:58,710
a kind of
thought that

8778
02:29:58,710 --> 02:29:58,720
thought that
 

8779
02:29:58,720 --> 02:30:00,230
thought that

mean uh photosynthesis

8800
02:30:23,349 --> 02:30:23,359
mean uh photosynthesis
 

8801
02:30:23,359 --> 02:30:26,309
mean uh photosynthesis
is figuring out some machinery that

8802
02:30:26,309 --> 02:30:26,319
is figuring out some machinery that

but man i don't know how i would feel

but man i don't know how i would feel
 

8813
02:30:35,680 --> 02:30:38,870
but man i don't know how i would feel
about just bacteria everywhere well it

8814
02:30:38,870 --> 02:30:38,880
about just bacteria everywhere well it
 

8815
02:30:38,880 --> 02:30:41,270
about just bacteria everywhere well it
would be depressing if it was true

8816
02:30:41,270 --> 02:30:41,280
would be depressing if it was true
 

8817
02:30:41,280 --> 02:30:42,309

i don't think natural i don't know

02:30:43,680 --> 02:30:45,030
i don't think natural i don't know
what's more depressing bacteria

8822
02:30:45,030 --> 02:30:45,040
what's more depressing bacteria
 

8823
02:30:45,040 --> 02:30:47,270
what's more depressing bacteria
everywhere nothing everywhere

8824
02:30:47,270 --> 02:30:47,280

yes either of them are chilling yeah but

8826
02:30:50,469 --> 02:30:50,479
yes either of them are chilling yeah but
 

8827
02:30:50,479 --> 02:30:52,150
yes either of them are chilling yeah but
whether it's chilling or not i don't

8828
02:30:52,150 --> 02:30:52,160
whether it's chilling or not i don't
 

8829
02:30:52,160 --> 02:30:53,990
whether it's chilling or not i don't
think should

8830
02:30:53,990 --> 02:30:54,000
think should
 

8831
02:30:54,000 --> 02:30:55,990
think should
force us to change our view about

8832
02:30:55,990 --> 02:30:56,000
force us to change our view about
 

8833
02:30:56,000 --> 02:30:57,910
force us to change our view about
whether it's real or not

8834
02:30:57,910 --> 02:30:57,920
whether it's real or not
 

8835
02:30:57,920 --> 02:30:59,590
whether it's real or not
and what i'm saying may or may not be

8836
02:30:59,590 --> 02:30:59,600
and what i'm saying may or may not be
 

8837
02:30:59,600 --> 02:31:01,349
and what i'm saying may or may not be
true so how would you feel if we

8838
02:31:01,349 --> 02:31:01,359
true so how would you feel if we
 

8839
02:31:01,359 --> 02:31:03,670
true so how would you feel if we
discovered life on mars

8840
02:31:03,670 --> 02:31:03,680
discovered life on mars
 

8841
02:31:03,680 --> 02:31:05,270
discovered life on mars
absolutely it sounds like you would be

8842
02:31:05,270 --> 02:31:05,280
absolutely it sounds like you would be
 

8843
02:31:05,280 --> 02:31:07,510
absolutely it sounds like you would be
less excited than some others

8844
02:31:07,510 --> 02:31:07,520
less excited than some others
 

8845
02:31:07,520 --> 02:31:09,429
less excited than some others
because you're like well what i would be

8846
02:31:09,429 --> 02:31:09,439
because you're like well what i would be
 

8847
02:31:09,439 --> 02:31:11,190
because you're like well what i would be
most interested in is how similar to

8848
02:31:11,190 --> 02:31:11,200
most interested in is how similar to
 

8849
02:31:11,200 --> 02:31:12,230
most interested in is how similar to
life on earth it would be it would

8850
02:31:12,230 --> 02:31:12,240
life on earth it would be it would
 

8851
02:31:12,240 --> 02:31:13,510
life on earth it would be it would
actually turn into quite a subtle

8852
02:31:13,510 --> 02:31:13,520
actually turn into quite a subtle
 

8853
02:31:13,520 --> 02:31:15,750
actually turn into quite a subtle
problem because

8854
02:31:15,750 --> 02:31:15,760
problem because
 

8855
02:31:15,760 --> 02:31:17,830
problem because
the

8856
02:31:17,830 --> 02:31:17,840
the
 

8857
02:31:17,840 --> 02:31:19,670
the
the likelihood of life having gone to

8858
02:31:19,670 --> 02:31:19,680
the likelihood of life having gone to
 

8859
02:31:19,680 --> 02:31:21,429
the likelihood of life having gone to
and fro between between mars and the

8860
02:31:21,429 --> 02:31:21,439
and fro between between mars and the
 

8861
02:31:21,439 --> 02:31:22,950
and fro between between mars and the
earth is

8862
02:31:22,950 --> 02:31:22,960
earth is
 

8863
02:31:22,960 --> 02:31:25,030
earth is
is quite i wouldn't say high but it's

8864
02:31:25,030 --> 02:31:25,040
is quite i wouldn't say high but it's
 

8865
02:31:25,040 --> 02:31:27,510
is quite i wouldn't say high but it's
not low it's quite feasible

8866
02:31:27,510 --> 02:31:27,520
not low it's quite feasible
 

8867
02:31:27,520 --> 02:31:30,230
not low it's quite feasible
and so if we found life on mars and it

8868
02:31:30,230 --> 02:31:30,240
and so if we found life on mars and it
 

8869
02:31:30,240 --> 02:31:31,110
and so if we found life on mars and it
had

8870
02:31:31,110 --> 02:31:31,120
had
 

8871
02:31:31,120 --> 02:31:32,630
had
very similar genetic code but it was

8872
02:31:32,630 --> 02:31:32,640
very similar genetic code but it was
 

8873
02:31:32,640 --> 02:31:34,309
very similar genetic code but it was
slightly different

8874
02:31:34,309 --> 02:31:34,319
slightly different

02:31:34,319 --> 02:31:35,750
slightly different
most people would interpret that

8876
02:31:35,750 --> 02:31:35,760
most people would interpret that
 

8877
02:31:35,760 --> 02:31:37,429
most people would interpret that
immediately as evidence that they've

8878
02:31:37,429 --> 02:31:37,439
immediately as evidence that they've
 

8879
02:31:37,439 --> 02:31:38,870
immediately as evidence that they've
been transit one way or the other and

02:31:38,870 --> 02:31:38,880
been transit one way or the other and
 

8881
02:31:38,880 --> 02:31:40,550

02:31:43,920 --> 02:31:45,510
one way the other way the other way to
see that question though would be to say

8888
02:31:45,510 --> 02:31:45,520
see that question though would be to say
 

8889
02:31:45,520 --> 02:31:47,349
see that question though would be to say
well actually though the beginnings of

8890
02:31:47,349 --> 02:31:47,359
well actually though the beginnings of
 

8891
02:31:47,359 --> 02:31:49,510
well actually though the beginnings of
life lie in deterministic chemistry and

02:31:49,510 --> 02:31:49,520
life lie in deterministic chemistry and
 

8893
02:31:49,520 --> 02:31:52,150
life lie in deterministic chemistry and

won't say inevitably but potentially

02:32:02,710 --> 02:32:02,720
won't say inevitably but potentially
 

8903
02:32:02,720 --> 02:32:04,550
won't say inevitably but potentially
almost inevitably come up with a genetic

02:32:04,560 --> 02:32:06,230
almost inevitably come up with a genetic

02:32:28,800 --> 02:32:31,510
we have
uh d sugars and l amino acids right

02:32:31,510 --> 02:32:31,520
uh d sugars and l amino acids right

02:32:34,880 --> 02:32:37,510
across all of life but lipids
uh we have the bacteria have one one

8936
02:32:37,510 --> 02:32:37,520
uh we have the bacteria have one one
 

8937
02:32:37,520 --> 02:32:39,910
uh we have the bacteria have one one
stereoisomer and the bacteria have the

8938
02:32:39,910 --> 02:32:39,920
stereoisomer and the bacteria have the
 

8939
02:32:39,920 --> 02:32:42,230
stereoisomer and the bacteria have the
other the opposite stereoisomer

8940
02:32:42,230 --> 02:32:42,240
other the opposite stereoisomer
 

8941
02:32:42,240 --> 02:32:44,950
other the opposite stereoisomer
so it's perfectly possible to use one or

8942
02:32:44,950 --> 02:32:44,960
so it's perfectly possible to use one or
 

8943
02:32:44,960 --> 02:32:46,309
so it's perfectly possible to use one or
the other one

the other one
 

8945
02:32:46,319 --> 02:32:47,750
the other one
uh and the same would almost certainly

02:32:47,750 --> 02:32:47,760
uh and the same would almost certainly
 

8947
02:32:47,760 --> 02:32:51,110

go for i think george church

8948
02:32:51,110 --> 02:32:51,120
go for i think george church

02:32:51,120 --> 02:32:54,070
go for i think george church
has been trying to make life based on

8950
02:32:54,070 --> 02:32:54,080
has been trying to make life based on
 

8951
02:32:54,080 --> 02:32:56,630
has been trying to make life based on
the opposite stereoisomer

8952
02:32:56,630 --> 02:32:56,640
the opposite stereoisomer
 

8953
02:32:56,640 --> 02:32:58,230
the opposite stereoisomer
so it's perfectly possible to do and it

8954
02:32:58,230 --> 02:32:58,240
so it's perfectly possible to do and it
 

8955
02:32:58,240 --> 02:33:00,469
so it's perfectly possible to do and it
will work um

8956
02:33:00,469 --> 02:33:00,479
will work um
 

8957
02:33:00,479 --> 02:33:02,309
will work um
and if we were to find life on mars that

8958
02:33:02,309 --> 02:33:02,319
and if we were to find life on mars that
 

8959
02:33:02,319 --> 02:33:03,910
and if we were to find life on mars that
was using the opposite stereoisomer that

8960
02:33:03,910 --> 02:33:03,920
was using the opposite stereoisomer that
 

8961
02:33:03,920 --> 02:33:06,790
was using the opposite stereoisomer that
would be unequivocal evidence that life

8962
02:33:06,790 --> 02:33:06,800
would be unequivocal evidence that life
 

8963
02:33:06,800 --> 02:33:09,030
would be unequivocal evidence that life
had started independently there so

8964
02:33:09,030 --> 02:33:09,040
had started independently there so
 

8965
02:33:09,040 --> 02:33:10,790
had started independently there so
hopefully

8966
02:33:10,790 --> 02:33:10,800
hopefully
 

8967
02:33:10,800 --> 02:33:12,550
hopefully
the life we find will be on titan and

8968
02:33:12,550 --> 02:33:12,560
the life we find will be on titan and
 

8969
02:33:12,560 --> 02:33:14,790
the life we find will be on titan and
europa or something like that where it's

8970
02:33:14,790 --> 02:33:14,800
europa or something like that where it's
 

8971
02:33:14,800 --> 02:33:17,110
europa or something like that where it's
less likely that we shared and it's

8972
02:33:17,110 --> 02:33:17,120
less likely that we shared and it's
 

8973
02:33:17,120 --> 02:33:18,550
less likely that we shared and it's
harsher conditions so there's going to

8974
02:33:18,550 --> 02:33:18,560
harsher conditions so there's going to
 

8975
02:33:18,560 --> 02:33:20,630
harsher conditions so there's going to
be weirder kind of life

8976
02:33:20,630 --> 02:33:20,640
be weirder kind of life
 

8977
02:33:20,640 --> 02:33:22,630
be weirder kind of life
i wouldn't count on that because

8978
02:33:22,630 --> 02:33:22,640
i wouldn't count on that because
 

8979
02:33:22,640 --> 02:33:25,270
i wouldn't count on that because
life started in deep sea hydrothermal

8980
02:33:25,270 --> 02:33:25,280
life started in deep sea hydrothermal
 

8981
02:33:25,280 --> 02:33:27,910
life started in deep sea hydrothermal
vents it's harsh that's pretty harsh

8982
02:33:27,910 --> 02:33:27,920
vents it's harsh that's pretty harsh
 

8983
02:33:27,920 --> 02:33:30,469
vents it's harsh that's pretty harsh
yeah so titan is different europa is

8984
02:33:30,469 --> 02:33:30,479
yeah so titan is different europa is
 

8985
02:33:30,479 --> 02:33:32,309
yeah so titan is different europa is
probably quite similar to earth in the

8986
02:33:32,309 --> 02:33:32,319
probably quite similar to earth in the
 

8987
02:33:32,319 --> 02:33:34,230
probably quite similar to earth in the
sense that we're dealing with an ocean

8988
02:33:34,230 --> 02:33:34,240
sense that we're dealing with an ocean
 

8989
02:33:34,240 --> 02:33:36,070
sense that we're dealing with an ocean
it's an acidic ocean there

8990
02:33:36,070 --> 02:33:36,080
it's an acidic ocean there
 

8991
02:33:36,080 --> 02:33:38,630
it's an acidic ocean there
um as the early earth would have been

8992
02:33:38,630 --> 02:33:38,640
um as the early earth would have been
 

8993
02:33:38,640 --> 02:33:40,389
um as the early earth would have been
and it almost only has hydrothermal

8994
02:33:40,389 --> 02:33:40,399
and it almost only has hydrothermal
 

8995
02:33:40,399 --> 02:33:43,510
and it almost only has hydrothermal
systems same with enceladus we can tell

8996
02:33:43,510 --> 02:33:43,520
systems same with enceladus we can tell
 

8997
02:33:43,520 --> 02:33:45,830
systems same with enceladus we can tell
that from these plumes coming from the

8998
02:33:45,830 --> 02:33:45,840
that from these plumes coming from the
 

8999
02:33:45,840 --> 02:33:47,190
that from these plumes coming from the
surface through the ice we know there's

9000
02:33:47,190 --> 02:33:47,200
surface through the ice we know there's
 

9001
02:33:47,200 --> 02:33:49,110
surface through the ice we know there's
a liquid ocean and we we can tell

9002
02:33:49,110 --> 02:33:49,120
a liquid ocean and we we can tell
 

9003
02:33:49,120 --> 02:33:51,270
a liquid ocean and we we can tell
roughly what the chemistry is

9004
02:33:51,270 --> 02:33:51,280
roughly what the chemistry is
 

9005
02:33:51,280 --> 02:33:53,030
roughly what the chemistry is
for titan we're dealing with liquid

9006
02:33:53,030 --> 02:33:53,040
for titan we're dealing with liquid
 

9007
02:33:53,040 --> 02:33:54,469
for titan we're dealing with liquid
methane and things like that so that

9008
02:33:54,469 --> 02:33:54,479
methane and things like that so that
 

9009
02:33:54,479 --> 02:33:55,830
methane and things like that so that
would really if there really is life

9010
02:33:55,830 --> 02:33:55,840
would really if there really is life
 

9011
02:33:55,840 --> 02:33:57,349
would really if there really is life
there it would really have to be very

9012
02:33:57,349 --> 02:33:57,359
there it would really have to be very
 

9013
02:33:57,359 --> 02:33:58,950
there it would really have to be very
very different to anything

9014
02:33:58,950 --> 02:33:58,960
very different to anything
 

9015
02:33:58,960 --> 02:34:00,870
very different to anything
uh that we know on earth

9016
02:34:00,870 --> 02:34:00,880
uh that we know on earth
 

9017
02:34:00,880 --> 02:34:02,950
uh that we know on earth
so the hard leap the hardest sleep the

9018
02:34:02,950 --> 02:34:02,960
so the hard leap the hardest sleep the
 

9019
02:34:02,960 --> 02:34:05,510
so the hard leap the hardest sleep the
most important leap is from

9020
02:34:05,510 --> 02:34:05,520
most important leap is from
 

9021
02:34:05,520 --> 02:34:09,349
most important leap is from
precarious to to eukaryotes eukaryotic

9022
02:34:09,349 --> 02:34:09,359
precarious to to eukaryotes eukaryotic
 

9023
02:34:09,359 --> 02:34:10,870
precarious to to eukaryotes eukaryotic
what's the second

9024
02:34:10,870 --> 02:34:10,880
what's the second
 

9025
02:34:10,880 --> 02:34:13,750
what's the second
if we're ranking what's what's the

9026
02:34:13,750 --> 02:34:13,760
if we're ranking what's what's the
 

9027
02:34:13,760 --> 02:34:16,309
if we're ranking what's what's the
what's uh you gave a lot of emphasis on

9028
02:34:16,309 --> 02:34:16,319
what's uh you gave a lot of emphasis on
 

9029
02:34:16,319 --> 02:34:19,110
what's uh you gave a lot of emphasis on
photosynthesis yeah and that would be my

9030
02:34:19,110 --> 02:34:19,120
photosynthesis yeah and that would be my
 

9031
02:34:19,120 --> 02:34:21,910
photosynthesis yeah and that would be my
second one i think but it's it's not so

9032
02:34:21,910 --> 02:34:21,920
second one i think but it's it's not so
 

9033
02:34:21,920 --> 02:34:23,990
second one i think but it's it's not so
much i mean photosynthesis is part of

9034
02:34:23,990 --> 02:34:24,000
much i mean photosynthesis is part of
 

9035
02:34:24,000 --> 02:34:25,110
much i mean photosynthesis is part of
the problem

9036
02:34:25,110 --> 02:34:25,120
the problem
 

9037
02:34:25,120 --> 02:34:27,110
the problem
it's a difficult thing to do

9038
02:34:27,110 --> 02:34:27,120
it's a difficult thing to do
 

9039
02:34:27,120 --> 02:34:28,150
it's a difficult thing to do
again

9040
02:34:28,150 --> 02:34:28,160
again
 

9041
02:34:28,160 --> 02:34:30,230
again
we know it happened once we don't know

9042
02:34:30,230 --> 02:34:30,240
we know it happened once we don't know
 

9043
02:34:30,240 --> 02:34:31,750
we know it happened once we don't know
why it happened once

9044
02:34:31,750 --> 02:34:31,760
why it happened once
 

9045
02:34:31,760 --> 02:34:32,950
why it happened once
um

9046
02:34:32,950 --> 02:34:32,960
um
 

9047
02:34:32,960 --> 02:34:34,230
um
but

9048
02:34:34,230 --> 02:34:34,240
but
 

9049
02:34:34,240 --> 02:34:36,550
but
the fact that

9050
02:34:36,550 --> 02:34:36,560
the fact that
 

9051
02:34:36,560 --> 02:34:37,349
the fact that
it

9052
02:34:37,349 --> 02:34:37,359
it
 

9053
02:34:37,359 --> 02:34:40,230
it
was kind of taken on board completely by

9054
02:34:40,230 --> 02:34:40,240
was kind of taken on board completely by
 

9055
02:34:40,240 --> 02:34:42,150
was kind of taken on board completely by
plants and algae and so on as

9056
02:34:42,150 --> 02:34:42,160
plants and algae and so on as
 

9057
02:34:42,160 --> 02:34:44,070
plants and algae and so on as
chloroplasts

9058
02:34:44,070 --> 02:34:44,080
chloroplasts
 

9059
02:34:44,080 --> 02:34:45,110
chloroplasts
and

9060
02:34:45,110 --> 02:34:45,120
and
 

9061
02:34:45,120 --> 02:34:46,630
and
did very well in completely different

9062
02:34:46,630 --> 02:34:46,640
did very well in completely different
 

9063
02:34:46,640 --> 02:34:48,230
did very well in completely different
environments and then on land and

9064
02:34:48,230 --> 02:34:48,240
environments and then on land and
 

9065
02:34:48,240 --> 02:34:50,070
environments and then on land and
whatever else seems to suggest that

9066
02:34:50,070 --> 02:34:50,080
whatever else seems to suggest that
 

9067
02:34:50,080 --> 02:34:51,429
whatever else seems to suggest that
there's no

9068
02:34:51,429 --> 02:34:51,439
there's no
 

9069
02:34:51,439 --> 02:34:53,429
there's no
there's no problem with exploring

9070
02:34:53,429 --> 02:34:53,439
there's no problem with exploring
 

9071
02:34:53,439 --> 02:34:54,389
there's no problem with exploring
whether you know you could have a

9072
02:34:54,389 --> 02:34:54,399
whether you know you could have a
 

9073
02:34:54,399 --> 02:34:55,910
whether you know you could have a
separate origin that explored this whole

9074
02:34:55,910 --> 02:34:55,920
separate origin that explored this whole
 

9075
02:34:55,920 --> 02:34:57,590
separate origin that explored this whole
domain over there that the bacteria had

9076
02:34:57,590 --> 02:34:57,600
domain over there that the bacteria had
 

9077
02:34:57,600 --> 02:34:58,870
domain over there that the bacteria had
never gone into

9078
02:34:58,870 --> 02:34:58,880
never gone into
 

9079
02:34:58,880 --> 02:34:59,830
never gone into
um

9080
02:34:59,830 --> 02:34:59,840
um
 

9081
02:34:59,840 --> 02:35:02,070
um
so that kind of says that the reason

9082
02:35:02,070 --> 02:35:02,080
so that kind of says that the reason
 

9083
02:35:02,080 --> 02:35:03,590
so that kind of says that the reason
that it only happened once is probably

9084
02:35:03,590 --> 02:35:03,600
that it only happened once is probably
 

9085
02:35:03,600 --> 02:35:04,870
that it only happened once is probably
because it's difficult because the

9086
02:35:04,870 --> 02:35:04,880
because it's difficult because the
 

9087
02:35:04,880 --> 02:35:06,710
because it's difficult because the
wiring is difficult

9088
02:35:06,710 --> 02:35:06,720
wiring is difficult
 

9089
02:35:06,720 --> 02:35:09,670
wiring is difficult
yeah um but then it it happened at least

9090
02:35:09,670 --> 02:35:09,680
yeah um but then it it happened at least
 

9091
02:35:09,680 --> 02:35:12,550
yeah um but then it it happened at least
2.2 billion years ago right before the

9092
02:35:12,550 --> 02:35:12,560
2.2 billion years ago right before the
 

9093
02:35:12,560 --> 02:35:15,110
2.2 billion years ago right before the
goe maybe as long as three billion years

9094
02:35:15,110 --> 02:35:15,120
goe maybe as long as three billion years
 

9095
02:35:15,120 --> 02:35:17,190
goe maybe as long as three billion years
ago when there are some people say there

9096
02:35:17,190 --> 02:35:17,200
ago when there are some people say there
 

9097
02:35:17,200 --> 02:35:18,790
ago when there are some people say there
are whiffs of oxygen there's just kind

9098
02:35:18,790 --> 02:35:18,800
are whiffs of oxygen there's just kind
 

9099
02:35:18,800 --> 02:35:20,630
are whiffs of oxygen there's just kind
of traces in the fossil in the in the

9100
02:35:20,630 --> 02:35:20,640
of traces in the fossil in the in the
 

9101
02:35:20,640 --> 02:35:22,150
of traces in the fossil in the in the
geochemical record that say maybe

9102
02:35:22,150 --> 02:35:22,160
geochemical record that say maybe
 

9103
02:35:22,160 --> 02:35:23,990
geochemical record that say maybe
there's a bit of oxygen then that's

9104
02:35:23,990 --> 02:35:24,000
there's a bit of oxygen then that's
 

9105
02:35:24,000 --> 02:35:26,230
there's a bit of oxygen then that's
really disputed some people say he goes

9106
02:35:26,230 --> 02:35:26,240
really disputed some people say he goes
 

9107
02:35:26,240 --> 02:35:27,910
really disputed some people say he goes
all the way back four billion years ago

9108
02:35:27,910 --> 02:35:27,920
all the way back four billion years ago
 

9109
02:35:27,920 --> 02:35:30,550
all the way back four billion years ago
and and um it was the common ancestor of

9110
02:35:30,550 --> 02:35:30,560
and and um it was the common ancestor of
 

9111
02:35:30,560 --> 02:35:32,469
and and um it was the common ancestor of
life on earth was photosynthetic so

9112
02:35:32,469 --> 02:35:32,479
life on earth was photosynthetic so
 

9113
02:35:32,479 --> 02:35:34,150
life on earth was photosynthetic so
immediately you've got you know groups

9114
02:35:34,150 --> 02:35:34,160
immediately you've got you know groups
 

9115
02:35:34,160 --> 02:35:36,070
immediately you've got you know groups
of people who disagree over a two

9116
02:35:36,070 --> 02:35:36,080
of people who disagree over a two
 

9117
02:35:36,080 --> 02:35:38,710
of people who disagree over a two
billion year period of time about when

9118
02:35:38,710 --> 02:35:38,720
billion year period of time about when
 

9119
02:35:38,720 --> 02:35:40,469
billion year period of time about when
it started

9120
02:35:40,469 --> 02:35:40,479
it started
 

9121
02:35:40,479 --> 02:35:43,590
it started
um but well

9122
02:35:43,590 --> 02:35:43,600

 

9123
02:35:43,600 --> 02:35:44,950

let's take the latest date when it's

9124
02:35:44,950 --> 02:35:44,960
let's take the latest date when it's
 

9125
02:35:44,960 --> 02:35:47,270
let's take the latest date when it's
unequivocal that's 2.2 billion years ago

9126
02:35:47,270 --> 02:35:47,280
unequivocal that's 2.2 billion years ago
 

9127
02:35:47,280 --> 02:35:48,950
unequivocal that's 2.2 billion years ago
through to around about the time of the

9128
02:35:48,950 --> 02:35:48,960
through to around about the time of the
 

9129
02:35:48,960 --> 02:35:50,790
through to around about the time of the
cambrian explosion when oxygen levels

9130
02:35:50,790 --> 02:35:50,800
cambrian explosion when oxygen levels
 

9131
02:35:50,800 --> 02:35:53,830
cambrian explosion when oxygen levels
definitely got close to modern levels uh

9132
02:35:53,830 --> 02:35:53,840
definitely got close to modern levels uh
 

9133
02:35:53,840 --> 02:35:56,070
definitely got close to modern levels uh
which was around about 550 million years

9134
02:35:56,070 --> 02:35:56,080
which was around about 550 million years
 

9135
02:35:56,080 --> 02:35:58,070
which was around about 550 million years
ago so we've gone more than one and a

9136
02:35:58,070 --> 02:35:58,080
ago so we've gone more than one and a
 

9137
02:35:58,080 --> 02:35:59,910
ago so we've gone more than one and a
half billion years

9138
02:35:59,910 --> 02:35:59,920
half billion years
 

9139
02:35:59,920 --> 02:36:02,309
half billion years
where the earth was in stasis

9140
02:36:02,309 --> 02:36:02,319
where the earth was in stasis
 

9141
02:36:02,319 --> 02:36:05,110
where the earth was in stasis
um nothing much changed it's known as

9142
02:36:05,110 --> 02:36:05,120
um nothing much changed it's known as
 

9143
02:36:05,120 --> 02:36:07,030
um nothing much changed it's known as
the boring billion in fact

9144
02:36:07,030 --> 02:36:07,040
the boring billion in fact
 

9145
02:36:07,040 --> 02:36:09,830
the boring billion in fact
um uh probably stuff was that was when

9146
02:36:09,830 --> 02:36:09,840
um uh probably stuff was that was when
 

9147
02:36:09,840 --> 02:36:11,590
um uh probably stuff was that was when
you carries arose somewhere in there but

9148
02:36:11,590 --> 02:36:11,600
you carries arose somewhere in there but
 

9149
02:36:11,600 --> 02:36:15,270
you carries arose somewhere in there but
it's uh

9150
02:36:15,270 --> 02:36:15,280

 

9151
02:36:15,280 --> 02:36:16,790

so this idea that the world is

9152
02:36:16,790 --> 02:36:16,800
so this idea that the world is
 

9153
02:36:16,800 --> 02:36:18,070
so this idea that the world is
constantly changing that we're

9154
02:36:18,070 --> 02:36:18,080
constantly changing that we're
 

9155
02:36:18,080 --> 02:36:20,070
constantly changing that we're
constantly evolving that we're moving up

9156
02:36:20,070 --> 02:36:20,080
constantly evolving that we're moving up
 

9157
02:36:20,080 --> 02:36:22,389
constantly evolving that we're moving up
some ramp it's a very human idea but in

9158
02:36:22,389 --> 02:36:22,399
some ramp it's a very human idea but in
 

9159
02:36:22,399 --> 02:36:23,590
some ramp it's a very human idea but in
reality

9160
02:36:23,590 --> 02:36:23,600
reality
 

9161
02:36:23,600 --> 02:36:24,389
reality
though

9162
02:36:24,389 --> 02:36:24,399
though
 

9163
02:36:24,399 --> 02:36:25,590
though
there are

9164
02:36:25,590 --> 02:36:25,600
there are
 

9165
02:36:25,600 --> 02:36:27,030
there are
um

9166
02:36:27,030 --> 02:36:27,040
um
 

9167
02:36:27,040 --> 02:36:29,030
um
there there are kind of

9168
02:36:29,030 --> 02:36:29,040
there there are kind of
 

9169
02:36:29,040 --> 02:36:31,910
there there are kind of
tipping points to a new stable

9170
02:36:31,910 --> 02:36:31,920
tipping points to a new stable
 

9171
02:36:31,920 --> 02:36:34,550
tipping points to a new stable
equilibrium where the

9172
02:36:34,550 --> 02:36:34,560
equilibrium where the
 

9173
02:36:34,560 --> 02:36:36,309
equilibrium where the
cells that are producing oxygen are

9174
02:36:36,309 --> 02:36:36,319
cells that are producing oxygen are
 

9175
02:36:36,319 --> 02:36:37,990
cells that are producing oxygen are
precisely counterbalanced by the cells

9176
02:36:37,990 --> 02:36:38,000
precisely counterbalanced by the cells
 

9177
02:36:38,000 --> 02:36:39,910
precisely counterbalanced by the cells
that are consuming that oxygen which is

9178
02:36:39,910 --> 02:36:39,920
that are consuming that oxygen which is
 

9179
02:36:39,920 --> 02:36:41,270
that are consuming that oxygen which is
why it's 21

9180
02:36:41,270 --> 02:36:41,280
why it's 21
 

9181
02:36:41,280 --> 02:36:43,190
why it's 21
now and has been that way for hundreds

9182
02:36:43,190 --> 02:36:43,200
now and has been that way for hundreds
 

9183
02:36:43,200 --> 02:36:44,950
now and has been that way for hundreds
of millions of years we have a very

9184
02:36:44,950 --> 02:36:44,960
of millions of years we have a very
 

9185
02:36:44,960 --> 02:36:47,349
of millions of years we have a very
precise balance you go through a tipping

9186
02:36:47,349 --> 02:36:47,359
precise balance you go through a tipping
 

9187
02:36:47,359 --> 02:36:49,750
precise balance you go through a tipping
point and you don't know where the next

9188
02:36:49,750 --> 02:36:49,760
point and you don't know where the next
 

9189
02:36:49,760 --> 02:36:51,750
point and you don't know where the next
stable state is going to be but it can

9190
02:36:51,750 --> 02:36:51,760
stable state is going to be but it can
 

9191
02:36:51,760 --> 02:36:53,990
stable state is going to be but it can
be a long way from here

9192
02:36:53,990 --> 02:36:54,000
be a long way from here
 

9193
02:36:54,000 --> 02:36:56,150
be a long way from here
and so if we change the world with

9194
02:36:56,150 --> 02:36:56,160
and so if we change the world with
 

9195
02:36:56,160 --> 02:36:57,910
and so if we change the world with
global warming there will be a tipping

9196
02:36:57,910 --> 02:36:57,920
global warming there will be a tipping
 

9197
02:36:57,920 --> 02:37:00,550
global warming there will be a tipping
point question is where and when and

9198
02:37:00,550 --> 02:37:00,560
point question is where and when and
 

9199
02:37:00,560 --> 02:37:02,070
point question is where and when and
what's the next stable state it may be

9200
02:37:02,070 --> 02:37:02,080
what's the next stable state it may be
 

9201
02:37:02,080 --> 02:37:04,389
what's the next stable state it may be
uninhabitable to us it'll be habitable

9202
02:37:04,389 --> 02:37:04,399
uninhabitable to us it'll be habitable
 

9203
02:37:04,399 --> 02:37:05,510
uninhabitable to us it'll be habitable
to life

9204
02:37:05,510 --> 02:37:05,520
to life
 

9205
02:37:05,520 --> 02:37:06,790
to life
for sure

9206
02:37:06,790 --> 02:37:06,800
for sure
 

9207
02:37:06,800 --> 02:37:07,910
for sure
but there may be something like the

9208
02:37:07,910 --> 02:37:07,920
but there may be something like the
 

9209
02:37:07,920 --> 02:37:10,630
but there may be something like the
permian extinction where 95 of species

9210
02:37:10,630 --> 02:37:10,640
permian extinction where 95 of species
 

9211
02:37:10,640 --> 02:37:12,950
permian extinction where 95 of species
go extinct and there's a five to ten

9212
02:37:12,950 --> 02:37:12,960
go extinct and there's a five to ten
 

9213
02:37:12,960 --> 02:37:14,870
go extinct and there's a five to ten
million year gap and then life recovers

9214
02:37:14,870 --> 02:37:14,880
million year gap and then life recovers
 

9215
02:37:14,880 --> 02:37:15,750
million year gap and then life recovers
but

9216
02:37:15,750 --> 02:37:15,760
but
 

9217
02:37:15,760 --> 02:37:17,190
but
without humans and the question

9218
02:37:17,190 --> 02:37:17,200
without humans and the question
 

9219
02:37:17,200 --> 02:37:19,030
without humans and the question
statistically well without humans but

9220
02:37:19,030 --> 02:37:19,040
statistically well without humans but
 

9221
02:37:19,040 --> 02:37:21,830
statistically well without humans but
statistically does that ultimately lead

9222
02:37:21,830 --> 02:37:21,840
statistically does that ultimately lead
 

9223
02:37:21,840 --> 02:37:23,750
statistically does that ultimately lead
to greater complexity more interesting

02:37:23,750 --> 02:37:23,760
to greater complexity more interesting

9230
02:37:28,550 --> 02:37:28,560
appearance of oxygen
 

9231
02:37:28,560 --> 02:37:30,710
appearance of oxygen
with the goe there was a tipping point

9232
02:37:30,710 --> 02:37:30,720
with the goe there was a tipping point
 

9233
02:37:30,720 --> 02:37:32,469
with the goe there was a tipping point
which led to a long-term stable state

9234
02:37:32,469 --> 02:37:32,479
which led to a long-term stable state
 

9235
02:37:32,479 --> 02:37:33,990
which led to a long-term stable state
that was equivalent to the black sea

9236
02:37:33,990 --> 02:37:34,000
that was equivalent to the black sea
 

9237
02:37:34,000 --> 02:37:36,309
that was equivalent to the black sea
today which is to say oxygenated at the

9238
02:37:36,309 --> 02:37:36,319
today which is to say oxygenated at the
 

9239
02:37:36,319 --> 02:37:38,790
today which is to say oxygenated at the
very surface and stagnant sterile not

9240
02:37:38,790 --> 02:37:38,800
very surface and stagnant sterile not
 

9241
02:37:38,800 --> 02:37:42,389
very surface and stagnant sterile not
sterile but um but sulfurous lower down

9242
02:37:42,389 --> 02:37:42,399
sterile but um but sulfurous lower down
 

9243
02:37:42,399 --> 02:37:43,510
sterile but um but sulfurous lower down
um

9244
02:37:43,510 --> 02:37:43,520
um
 

9245
02:37:43,520 --> 02:37:44,309
um
and

9246
02:37:44,309 --> 02:37:44,319
and
 

9247
02:37:44,319 --> 02:37:46,630
and
and that was stable certainly around the

9248
02:37:46,630 --> 02:37:46,640
and that was stable certainly around the
 

9249
02:37:46,640 --> 02:37:48,630
and that was stable certainly around the
continental margins for more than a

9250
02:37:48,630 --> 02:37:48,640
continental margins for more than a
 

9251
02:37:48,640 --> 02:37:51,030
continental margins for more than a
billion years uh it was not a state that

9252
02:37:51,030 --> 02:37:51,040
billion years uh it was not a state that
 

9253
02:37:51,040 --> 02:37:53,670
billion years uh it was not a state that
led to progression in an obvious way

9254
02:37:53,670 --> 02:37:53,680
led to progression in an obvious way
 

9255
02:37:53,680 --> 02:37:55,270
led to progression in an obvious way
um

9256
02:37:55,270 --> 02:37:55,280
um
 

9257
02:37:55,280 --> 02:37:56,710
um
yeah i mean it's interesting to think

9258
02:37:56,710 --> 02:37:56,720
yeah i mean it's interesting to think
 

9259
02:37:56,720 --> 02:37:58,950
yeah i mean it's interesting to think
about evolution like what leads to

9260
02:37:58,950 --> 02:37:58,960
about evolution like what leads to
 

9261
02:37:58,960 --> 02:38:01,190
about evolution like what leads to
stable states

9262
02:38:01,190 --> 02:38:01,200
stable states
 

9263
02:38:01,200 --> 02:38:02,469
stable states
and uh

9264
02:38:02,469 --> 02:38:02,479
and uh
 

9265
02:38:02,479 --> 02:38:05,590
and uh
how often are

9266
02:38:05,590 --> 02:38:05,600

 

9267
02:38:05,600 --> 02:38:08,070

evolutionary pressures

9268
02:38:08,070 --> 02:38:08,080
evolutionary pressures
 

9269
02:38:08,080 --> 02:38:11,190
evolutionary pressures
emerging from the environment

9270
02:38:11,190 --> 02:38:11,200
emerging from the environment
 

9271
02:38:11,200 --> 02:38:11,990
emerging from the environment
so

9272
02:38:11,990 --> 02:38:12,000
so
 

9273
02:38:12,000 --> 02:38:13,990
so
maybe other planets are able to create

9274
02:38:13,990 --> 02:38:14,000
maybe other planets are able to create
 

9275
02:38:14,000 --> 02:38:15,830
maybe other planets are able to create
evolutionary pressures chemical

9276
02:38:15,830 --> 02:38:15,840
evolutionary pressures chemical
 

9277
02:38:15,840 --> 02:38:17,590
evolutionary pressures chemical
pressures whatever some kind of pressure

9278
02:38:17,590 --> 02:38:17,600
pressures whatever some kind of pressure
 

9279
02:38:17,600 --> 02:38:19,429
pressures whatever some kind of pressure
that say you're screwed unless you get

9280
02:38:19,429 --> 02:38:19,439
that say you're screwed unless you get
 

9281
02:38:19,439 --> 02:38:21,510
that say you're screwed unless you get
your together in the next

9282
02:38:21,510 --> 02:38:21,520
your together in the next
 

9283
02:38:21,520 --> 02:38:22,710
your together in the next
like

9284
02:38:22,710 --> 02:38:22,720
like
 

9285
02:38:22,720 --> 02:38:25,510
like
10 000 years like a lot of pressure

9286
02:38:25,510 --> 02:38:25,520
10 000 years like a lot of pressure
 

9287
02:38:25,520 --> 02:38:28,630
10 000 years like a lot of pressure
uh it seems like earth like the boring

9288
02:38:28,630 --> 02:38:28,640
uh it seems like earth like the boring
 

9289
02:38:28,640 --> 02:38:30,550
uh it seems like earth like the boring
building might be explained

9290
02:38:30,550 --> 02:38:30,560
building might be explained
 

9291
02:38:30,560 --> 02:38:32,710
building might be explained
in two ways one it's super difficult to

9292
02:38:32,710 --> 02:38:32,720
in two ways one it's super difficult to
 

9293
02:38:32,720 --> 02:38:34,790
in two ways one it's super difficult to
take any kind of next step

9294
02:38:34,790 --> 02:38:34,800
take any kind of next step
 

9295
02:38:34,800 --> 02:38:37,110
take any kind of next step
and uh the second way could be explained

9296
02:38:37,110 --> 02:38:37,120
and uh the second way could be explained
 

9297
02:38:37,120 --> 02:38:38,630
and uh the second way could be explained
is there's no reason to take the next

9298
02:38:38,630 --> 02:38:38,640
is there's no reason to take the next
 

9299
02:38:38,640 --> 02:38:40,870
is there's no reason to take the next
step no i think there is no reason but

9300
02:38:40,870 --> 02:38:40,880
step no i think there is no reason but
 

9301
02:38:40,880 --> 02:38:43,110
step no i think there is no reason but
at the end of it there was a there was a

9302
02:38:43,110 --> 02:38:43,120
at the end of it there was a there was a
 

9303
02:38:43,120 --> 02:38:44,710
at the end of it there was a there was a
snowball earth

9304
02:38:44,710 --> 02:38:44,720
snowball earth
 

9305
02:38:44,720 --> 02:38:47,110
snowball earth
um so there was a planetary catastrophe

9306
02:38:47,110 --> 02:38:47,120
um so there was a planetary catastrophe
 

9307
02:38:47,120 --> 02:38:49,590
um so there was a planetary catastrophe
on a huge scale where the the the

9308
02:38:49,590 --> 02:38:49,600
on a huge scale where the the the
 

9309
02:38:49,600 --> 02:38:52,550
on a huge scale where the the the
ice was the the sea was frozen at the

9310
02:38:52,550 --> 02:38:52,560
ice was the the sea was frozen at the
 

9311
02:38:52,560 --> 02:38:53,830
ice was the the sea was frozen at the
equator

9312
02:38:53,830 --> 02:38:53,840
equator
 

9313
02:38:53,840 --> 02:38:55,190
equator
um

9314
02:38:55,190 --> 02:38:55,200
um
 

9315
02:38:55,200 --> 02:38:58,150
um
and that forced change

9316
02:38:58,150 --> 02:38:58,160
and that forced change
 

9317
02:38:58,160 --> 02:38:59,990
and that forced change
in one way or another it's not long

9318
02:38:59,990 --> 02:39:00,000
in one way or another it's not long
 

9319
02:39:00,000 --> 02:39:01,670
in one way or another it's not long
after that 100 million years perhaps

9320
02:39:01,670 --> 02:39:01,680
after that 100 million years perhaps
 

9321
02:39:01,680 --> 02:39:03,429
after that 100 million years perhaps
after that so not short time but this is

9322
02:39:03,429 --> 02:39:03,439
after that so not short time but this is
 

9323
02:39:03,439 --> 02:39:05,429
after that so not short time but this is
when we begin to see animals there was a

9324
02:39:05,429 --> 02:39:05,439
when we begin to see animals there was a
 

9325
02:39:05,439 --> 02:39:07,670
when we begin to see animals there was a
shift again another tipping point that

9326
02:39:07,670 --> 02:39:07,680
shift again another tipping point that
 

9327
02:39:07,680 --> 02:39:10,469
shift again another tipping point that
led to catastrophic change that led to a

9328
02:39:10,469 --> 02:39:10,479
led to catastrophic change that led to a
 

9329
02:39:10,479 --> 02:39:12,150
led to catastrophic change that led to a
takeoff then

9330
02:39:12,150 --> 02:39:12,160
takeoff then
 

9331
02:39:12,160 --> 02:39:13,830
takeoff then
we don't really know why but one of the

9332
02:39:13,830 --> 02:39:13,840
we don't really know why but one of the
 

9333
02:39:13,840 --> 02:39:16,070
we don't really know why but one of the
reasons why that i discuss in the book

9334
02:39:16,070 --> 02:39:16,080
reasons why that i discuss in the book
 

9335
02:39:16,080 --> 02:39:17,429
reasons why that i discuss in the book
um

9336
02:39:17,429 --> 02:39:17,439
um
 

9337
02:39:17,439 --> 02:39:19,349
um
is about

9338
02:39:19,349 --> 02:39:19,359
is about
 

9339
02:39:19,359 --> 02:39:21,110
is about
sulfate being washed into the oceans

9340
02:39:21,110 --> 02:39:21,120
sulfate being washed into the oceans
 

9341
02:39:21,120 --> 02:39:23,590
sulfate being washed into the oceans
which sounds incredibly parochial

9342
02:39:23,590 --> 02:39:23,600
which sounds incredibly parochial
 

9343
02:39:23,600 --> 02:39:24,469
which sounds incredibly parochial
but

9344
02:39:24,469 --> 02:39:24,479
but
 

9345
02:39:24,479 --> 02:39:25,349
but
the

9346
02:39:25,349 --> 02:39:25,359
the
 

9347
02:39:25,359 --> 02:39:27,590
the
the issue is i mean that what the data

9348
02:39:27,590 --> 02:39:27,600
the issue is i mean that what the data
 

9349
02:39:27,600 --> 02:39:29,910
the issue is i mean that what the data
is showing we can we can track roughly

9350
02:39:29,910 --> 02:39:29,920
is showing we can we can track roughly
 

9351
02:39:29,920 --> 02:39:31,670
is showing we can we can track roughly
how oxygen was going into the atmosphere

9352
02:39:31,670 --> 02:39:31,680
how oxygen was going into the atmosphere
 

9353
02:39:31,680 --> 02:39:32,710
how oxygen was going into the atmosphere

02:39:32,720 --> 02:39:33,990
from
um

9356
02:39:33,990 --> 02:39:34,000
um
 

9357
02:39:34,000 --> 02:39:36,309
um
from carbon isotopes so there's two

9358
02:39:36,309 --> 02:39:36,319
from carbon isotopes so there's two
 

9359
02:39:36,319 --> 02:39:38,150
from carbon isotopes so there's two
there's two main isotopes of carbon that

9360
02:39:38,150 --> 02:39:38,160
there's two main isotopes of carbon that
 

9361
02:39:38,160 --> 02:39:39,670
there's two main isotopes of carbon that
we need to think about here one is

9362
02:39:39,670 --> 02:39:39,680
we need to think about here one is
 

9363
02:39:39,680 --> 02:39:42,630
we need to think about here one is
carbon-12 99 of carbon is carbon-12 and

9364
02:39:42,630 --> 02:39:42,640
carbon-12 99 of carbon is carbon-12 and
 

9365
02:39:42,640 --> 02:39:44,710
carbon-12 99 of carbon is carbon-12 and
then one percent of carbon is carbon-13

9366
02:39:44,710 --> 02:39:44,720
then one percent of carbon is carbon-13
 

9367
02:39:44,720 --> 02:39:46,150
then one percent of carbon is carbon-13
which is a stable isotope and then

9368
02:39:46,150 --> 02:39:46,160
which is a stable isotope and then
 

9369
02:39:46,160 --> 02:39:48,070
which is a stable isotope and then
there's carbon-14 which is a trivial

9370
02:39:48,070 --> 02:39:48,080
there's carbon-14 which is a trivial
 

9371
02:39:48,080 --> 02:39:50,630
there's carbon-14 which is a trivial
radioactive estrogen amount

9372
02:39:50,630 --> 02:39:50,640
radioactive estrogen amount
 

9373
02:39:50,640 --> 02:39:53,110
radioactive estrogen amount
so 13 is one percent

9374
02:39:53,110 --> 02:39:53,120
so 13 is one percent
 

9375
02:39:53,120 --> 02:39:53,990
so 13 is one percent
and

9376
02:39:53,990 --> 02:39:54,000
and
 

9377
02:39:54,000 --> 02:39:56,309
and
life and enzymes generally

9378
02:39:56,309 --> 02:39:56,319
life and enzymes generally
 

9379
02:39:56,319 --> 02:39:59,190
life and enzymes generally
you can think of carbon atoms as

9380
02:39:59,190 --> 02:39:59,200
you can think of carbon atoms as
 

9381
02:39:59,200 --> 02:40:00,870
you can think of carbon atoms as
little balls bouncing around bing bong

9382
02:40:00,870 --> 02:40:00,880
little balls bouncing around bing bong
 

9383
02:40:00,880 --> 02:40:02,710
little balls bouncing around bing bong
balls bouncing around carbon 12 moves a

9384
02:40:02,710 --> 02:40:02,720
balls bouncing around carbon 12 moves a
 

9385
02:40:02,720 --> 02:40:04,469
balls bouncing around carbon 12 moves a
little bit faster than carbon 13 because

9386
02:40:04,469 --> 02:40:04,479
little bit faster than carbon 13 because
 

9387
02:40:04,479 --> 02:40:05,750
little bit faster than carbon 13 because
it's lighter

9388
02:40:05,750 --> 02:40:05,760
it's lighter
 

9389
02:40:05,760 --> 02:40:07,429
it's lighter
and it's more likely to encounter an

9390
02:40:07,429 --> 02:40:07,439
and it's more likely to encounter an
 

9391
02:40:07,439 --> 02:40:08,469
and it's more likely to encounter an
enzyme

9392
02:40:08,469 --> 02:40:08,479
enzyme
 

9393
02:40:08,479 --> 02:40:10,389
enzyme
and so it's more likely to be fixed into

9394
02:40:10,389 --> 02:40:10,399
and so it's more likely to be fixed into
 

9395
02:40:10,399 --> 02:40:11,750
and so it's more likely to be fixed into
organic matter

9396
02:40:11,750 --> 02:40:11,760
organic matter
 

9397
02:40:11,760 --> 02:40:13,349
organic matter
and so organic matter is enriched and

9398
02:40:13,349 --> 02:40:13,359
and so organic matter is enriched and
 

9399
02:40:13,359 --> 02:40:14,550
and so organic matter is enriched and
this is just an observation it's

9400
02:40:14,550 --> 02:40:14,560
this is just an observation it's
 

9401
02:40:14,560 --> 02:40:17,510
this is just an observation it's
enriched in carbon 12 by a few percent

9402
02:40:17,510 --> 02:40:17,520
enriched in carbon 12 by a few percent
 

9403
02:40:17,520 --> 02:40:19,590
enriched in carbon 12 by a few percent
compared to carbon 13 relative to what

9404
02:40:19,590 --> 02:40:19,600
compared to carbon 13 relative to what
 

9405
02:40:19,600 --> 02:40:21,510
compared to carbon 13 relative to what
you would expect if it was just equal

9406
02:40:21,510 --> 02:40:21,520
you would expect if it was just equal
 

9407
02:40:21,520 --> 02:40:22,389
you would expect if it was just equal
and

9408
02:40:22,389 --> 02:40:22,399
and
 

9409
02:40:22,399 --> 02:40:25,750
and
if you then bury organic matter

9410
02:40:25,750 --> 02:40:25,760
if you then bury organic matter
 

9411
02:40:25,760 --> 02:40:27,990
if you then bury organic matter
as coal or

9412
02:40:27,990 --> 02:40:28,000
as coal or
 

9413
02:40:28,000 --> 02:40:30,070
as coal or
oil or whatever it may be

9414
02:40:30,070 --> 02:40:30,080
oil or whatever it may be
 

9415
02:40:30,080 --> 02:40:31,830
oil or whatever it may be
then it's no longer oxidized so some

9416
02:40:31,830 --> 02:40:31,840
then it's no longer oxidized so some
 

9417
02:40:31,840 --> 02:40:33,990
then it's no longer oxidized so some
oxygen remains left over in in the

9418
02:40:33,990 --> 02:40:34,000
oxygen remains left over in in the
 

9419
02:40:34,000 --> 02:40:36,230
oxygen remains left over in in the
atmosphere and that's how oxygen

9420
02:40:36,230 --> 02:40:36,240
atmosphere and that's how oxygen
 

9421
02:40:36,240 --> 02:40:37,510
atmosphere and that's how oxygen
accumulates in the atmosphere and you

9422
02:40:37,510 --> 02:40:37,520
accumulates in the atmosphere and you
 

9423
02:40:37,520 --> 02:40:39,349
accumulates in the atmosphere and you
can work out historically how much

9424
02:40:39,349 --> 02:40:39,359
can work out historically how much
 

9425
02:40:39,359 --> 02:40:40,389
can work out historically how much
oxygen there must have been in the

9426
02:40:40,389 --> 02:40:40,399
oxygen there must have been in the
 

9427
02:40:40,399 --> 02:40:42,469
oxygen there must have been in the
atmosphere by how much

9428
02:40:42,469 --> 02:40:42,479
atmosphere by how much
 

9429
02:40:42,479 --> 02:40:43,750
atmosphere by how much
carbon was being buried and you think

9430
02:40:43,750 --> 02:40:43,760
carbon was being buried and you think
 

9431
02:40:43,760 --> 02:40:45,349
carbon was being buried and you think
well how can we possibly know how much

9432
02:40:45,349 --> 02:40:45,359
well how can we possibly know how much
 

9433
02:40:45,359 --> 02:40:46,870
well how can we possibly know how much
carbon was being buried and the answer

9434
02:40:46,870 --> 02:40:46,880
carbon was being buried and the answer
 

9435
02:40:46,880 --> 02:40:49,110
carbon was being buried and the answer
is well if you're burying carbon 12

9436
02:40:49,110 --> 02:40:49,120
is well if you're burying carbon 12
 

9437
02:40:49,120 --> 02:40:50,630
is well if you're burying carbon 12
what you're leaving behind is more

9438
02:40:50,630 --> 02:40:50,640
what you're leaving behind is more
 

9439
02:40:50,640 --> 02:40:52,150
what you're leaving behind is more
carbon 13 in the oceans and that

9440
02:40:52,150 --> 02:40:52,160
carbon 13 in the oceans and that
 

9441
02:40:52,160 --> 02:40:54,630
carbon 13 in the oceans and that
precipitates out in limestone so you can

9442
02:40:54,630 --> 02:40:54,640
precipitates out in limestone so you can
 

9443
02:40:54,640 --> 02:40:56,469
precipitates out in limestone so you can
look at limestones over these ages and

9444
02:40:56,469 --> 02:40:56,479
look at limestones over these ages and
 

9445
02:40:56,479 --> 02:40:58,950
look at limestones over these ages and
work out what's the carbon 13 signal

9446
02:40:58,950 --> 02:40:58,960
work out what's the carbon 13 signal
 

9447
02:40:58,960 --> 02:41:00,870
work out what's the carbon 13 signal
and that gives you a kind of a feedback

9448
02:41:00,870 --> 02:41:00,880
and that gives you a kind of a feedback
 

9449
02:41:00,880 --> 02:41:03,429
and that gives you a kind of a feedback
on what they want the oxygen content

9450
02:41:03,429 --> 02:41:03,439
on what they want the oxygen content
 

9451
02:41:03,439 --> 02:41:04,950
on what they want the oxygen content
right before the cambrian explosion

9452
02:41:04,950 --> 02:41:04,960
right before the cambrian explosion
 

9453
02:41:04,960 --> 02:41:06,630
right before the cambrian explosion
there was what's called a negative

9454
02:41:06,630 --> 02:41:06,640
there was what's called a negative
 

9455
02:41:06,640 --> 02:41:08,950
there was what's called a negative
isotope anomaly excursion which is

9456
02:41:08,950 --> 02:41:08,960
isotope anomaly excursion which is
 

9457
02:41:08,960 --> 02:41:10,950
isotope anomaly excursion which is
basically the carbon 13 goes down by a

9458
02:41:10,950 --> 02:41:10,960
basically the carbon 13 goes down by a
 

9459
02:41:10,960 --> 02:41:12,710
basically the carbon 13 goes down by a
massive amount and then back up again 10

9460
02:41:12,710 --> 02:41:12,720
massive amount and then back up again 10
 

9461
02:41:12,720 --> 02:41:15,349
massive amount and then back up again 10
million years later

9462
02:41:15,349 --> 02:41:15,359
million years later
 

9463
02:41:15,359 --> 02:41:18,389
million years later
and what that seems to be saying is the

9464
02:41:18,389 --> 02:41:18,399
and what that seems to be saying is the
 

9465
02:41:18,399 --> 02:41:22,070
and what that seems to be saying is the
amount of carbon 12 in the oceans

9466
02:41:22,070 --> 02:41:22,080
amount of carbon 12 in the oceans
 

9467
02:41:22,080 --> 02:41:23,190
amount of carbon 12 in the oceans
um

9468
02:41:23,190 --> 02:41:23,200
um
 

9469
02:41:23,200 --> 02:41:25,910
um
was was disappearing

9470
02:41:25,910 --> 02:41:25,920
was was disappearing
 

9471
02:41:25,920 --> 02:41:29,190
was was disappearing
which is to say it was being oxidized

9472
02:41:29,190 --> 02:41:29,200
which is to say it was being oxidized
 

9473
02:41:29,200 --> 02:41:31,429
which is to say it was being oxidized
um and if it's being oxidized it's

9474
02:41:31,429 --> 02:41:31,439
um and if it's being oxidized it's
 

9475
02:41:31,439 --> 02:41:34,389
um and if it's being oxidized it's
consuming oxygen and that should so a

9476
02:41:34,389 --> 02:41:34,399
consuming oxygen and that should so a
 

9477
02:41:34,399 --> 02:41:36,870
consuming oxygen and that should so a
big carbon 13 signal says that the ratio

9478
02:41:36,870 --> 02:41:36,880
big carbon 13 signal says that the ratio
 

9479
02:41:36,880 --> 02:41:39,269
big carbon 13 signal says that the ratio
of carbon 12 to carbon 13 is is really

9480
02:41:39,269 --> 02:41:39,279
of carbon 12 to carbon 13 is is really
 

9481
02:41:39,279 --> 02:41:41,190
of carbon 12 to carbon 13 is is really
going down which means there's

9482
02:41:41,190 --> 02:41:41,200
going down which means there's
 

9483
02:41:41,200 --> 02:41:43,349
going down which means there's
there's much more carbon 12 being taken

9484
02:41:43,349 --> 02:41:43,359
there's much more carbon 12 being taken
 

9485
02:41:43,359 --> 02:41:44,710
there's much more carbon 12 being taken
out and being oxidized sorry this is

9486
02:41:44,710 --> 02:41:44,720
out and being oxidized sorry this is
 

9487
02:41:44,720 --> 02:41:47,030
out and being oxidized sorry this is
getting too complex but well it's a good

9488
02:41:47,030 --> 02:41:47,040
getting too complex but well it's a good
 

9489
02:41:47,040 --> 02:41:48,550
getting too complex but well it's a good
it's a good way to estimate the amount

9490
02:41:48,550 --> 02:41:48,560
it's a good way to estimate the amount
 

9491
02:41:48,560 --> 02:41:51,030
it's a good way to estimate the amount
of oxygen if you calculate the amount of

9492
02:41:51,030 --> 02:41:51,040
of oxygen if you calculate the amount of
 

9493
02:41:51,040 --> 02:41:53,030
of oxygen if you calculate the amount of
oxygen based on the assumption that all

9494
02:41:53,030 --> 02:41:53,040
oxygen based on the assumption that all
 

9495
02:41:53,040 --> 02:41:54,790
oxygen based on the assumption that all
this carbon 12 that's being taken out is

9496
02:41:54,790 --> 02:41:54,800
this carbon 12 that's being taken out is
 

9497
02:41:54,800 --> 02:41:56,710
this carbon 12 that's being taken out is
being oxidized by oxygen the answer is

9498
02:41:56,710 --> 02:41:56,720
being oxidized by oxygen the answer is
 

9499
02:41:56,720 --> 02:41:58,230
being oxidized by oxygen the answer is
all the oxygen in the atmosphere gets

9500
02:41:58,230 --> 02:41:58,240
all the oxygen in the atmosphere gets
 

9501
02:41:58,240 --> 02:42:00,950
all the oxygen in the atmosphere gets
stripped out there is none left yeah um

9502
02:42:00,950 --> 02:42:00,960
stripped out there is none left yeah um
 

9503
02:42:00,960 --> 02:42:02,710
stripped out there is none left yeah um
and yet the rest of the geological

9504
02:42:02,710 --> 02:42:02,720
and yet the rest of the geological
 

9505
02:42:02,720 --> 02:42:04,550
and yet the rest of the geological
indicators say no there's oxygen in the

9506
02:42:04,550 --> 02:42:04,560
indicators say no there's oxygen in the
 

9507
02:42:04,560 --> 02:42:05,990
indicators say no there's oxygen in the
atmosphere

9508
02:42:05,990 --> 02:42:06,000
atmosphere
 

9509
02:42:06,000 --> 02:42:07,990
atmosphere
so it's a kind of a paradox and and the

9510
02:42:07,990 --> 02:42:08,000
so it's a kind of a paradox and and the
 

9511
02:42:08,000 --> 02:42:10,070
so it's a kind of a paradox and and the
only way to explain this paradox just on

9512
02:42:10,070 --> 02:42:10,080
only way to explain this paradox just on
 

9513
02:42:10,080 --> 02:42:12,230
only way to explain this paradox just on
mass balance of how much stuff is in the

9514
02:42:12,230 --> 02:42:12,240
mass balance of how much stuff is in the
 

9515
02:42:12,240 --> 02:42:13,990
mass balance of how much stuff is in the
air how much stuff is in the oceans and

9516
02:42:13,990 --> 02:42:14,000
air how much stuff is in the oceans and
 

9517
02:42:14,000 --> 02:42:17,190
air how much stuff is in the oceans and
so on um is to assume that it what

9518
02:42:17,190 --> 02:42:17,200
so on um is to assume that it what
 

9519
02:42:17,200 --> 02:42:19,590
so on um is to assume that it what
oxygen was not the oxygen it was sulfate

9520
02:42:19,590 --> 02:42:19,600
oxygen was not the oxygen it was sulfate
 

9521
02:42:19,600 --> 02:42:22,389
oxygen was not the oxygen it was sulfate
sulfate was being washed into the oceans

9522
02:42:22,389 --> 02:42:22,399
sulfate was being washed into the oceans
 

9523
02:42:22,399 --> 02:42:24,790
sulfate was being washed into the oceans
it's used as an electron acceptor by

9524
02:42:24,790 --> 02:42:24,800
it's used as an electron acceptor by
 

9525
02:42:24,800 --> 02:42:26,710
it's used as an electron acceptor by
sulfate reducing bacteria just as we use

9526
02:42:26,710 --> 02:42:26,720
sulfate reducing bacteria just as we use
 

9527
02:42:26,720 --> 02:42:28,469
sulfate reducing bacteria just as we use
oxygen as an electron acceptor so they

9528
02:42:28,469 --> 02:42:28,479
oxygen as an electron acceptor so they
 

9529
02:42:28,479 --> 02:42:30,070
oxygen as an electron acceptor so they
pass their electrons to sulfate instead

9530
02:42:30,070 --> 02:42:30,080
pass their electrons to sulfate instead
 

9531
02:42:30,080 --> 02:42:31,590
pass their electrons to sulfate instead
of oxygen

9532
02:42:31,590 --> 02:42:31,600
of oxygen
 

9533
02:42:31,600 --> 02:42:34,630
of oxygen
anterior did yeah yeah so these are

9534
02:42:34,630 --> 02:42:34,640
anterior did yeah yeah so these are
 

9535
02:42:34,640 --> 02:42:37,190
anterior did yeah yeah so these are
these are these are bacteria so they're

9536
02:42:37,190 --> 02:42:37,200
these are these are bacteria so they're
 

9537
02:42:37,200 --> 02:42:40,469
these are these are bacteria so they're
oxidizing carbon organic carbon

9538
02:42:40,469 --> 02:42:40,479
oxidizing carbon organic carbon
 

9539
02:42:40,479 --> 02:42:42,230
oxidizing carbon organic carbon
with sulfate passing the electrons onto

9540
02:42:42,230 --> 02:42:42,240
with sulfate passing the electrons onto
 

9541
02:42:42,240 --> 02:42:44,070
with sulfate passing the electrons onto

9542
02:42:44,070 --> 02:42:44,080

9543
02:42:44,080 --> 02:42:46,550
sulfate that
reacts with iron to form iron pyrites or

9544
02:42:46,550 --> 02:42:46,560
reacts with iron to form iron pyrites or
 

9545
02:42:46,560 --> 02:42:48,550
reacts with iron to form iron pyrites or
fool's gold sinks down to the bottom

9546
02:42:48,550 --> 02:42:48,560
fool's gold sinks down to the bottom
 

9547
02:42:48,560 --> 02:42:51,349
fool's gold sinks down to the bottom
gets buried out of the system

9548
02:42:51,349 --> 02:42:51,359
gets buried out of the system
 

9549
02:42:51,359 --> 02:42:53,030
gets buried out of the system
and this can account for the mass

9550
02:42:53,030 --> 02:42:53,040
and this can account for the mass
 

9551
02:42:53,040 --> 02:42:55,510
and this can account for the mass
balance so why does it matter

9552
02:42:55,510 --> 02:42:55,520
balance so why does it matter
 

9553
02:42:55,520 --> 02:42:57,110
balance so why does it matter
it matters because

9554
02:42:57,110 --> 02:42:57,120
it matters because
 

9555
02:42:57,120 --> 02:42:59,910
it matters because
what it says is there was a chance event

9556
02:42:59,910 --> 02:42:59,920
what it says is there was a chance event
 

9557
02:42:59,920 --> 02:43:01,990
what it says is there was a chance event
tectonically there was a lot of sulfate

9558
02:43:01,990 --> 02:43:02,000
tectonically there was a lot of sulfate
 

9559
02:43:02,000 --> 02:43:04,790
tectonically there was a lot of sulfate
sitting on land as a some kind of

9560
02:43:04,790 --> 02:43:04,800
sitting on land as a some kind of
 

9561
02:43:04,800 --> 02:43:06,469
sitting on land as a some kind of
mineral

9562
02:43:06,469 --> 02:43:06,479
mineral
 

9563
02:43:06,479 --> 02:43:08,950
mineral
so calcium sulfate minerals for example

9564
02:43:08,950 --> 02:43:08,960
so calcium sulfate minerals for example
 

9565
02:43:08,960 --> 02:43:10,710
so calcium sulfate minerals for example
are evaporitic

9566
02:43:10,710 --> 02:43:10,720
are evaporitic
 

9567
02:43:10,720 --> 02:43:13,510
are evaporitic
um and and um because there happened to

9568
02:43:13,510 --> 02:43:13,520
um and and um because there happened to
 

9569
02:43:13,520 --> 02:43:16,309
um and and um because there happened to
be some continents some continental

9570
02:43:16,309 --> 02:43:16,319
be some continents some continental
 

9571
02:43:16,319 --> 02:43:18,389
be some continents some continental

02:43:20,309 --> 02:43:20,319
sulfate was pushed up the side of a
 

9575
02:43:20,319 --> 02:43:21,750
sulfate was pushed up the side of a
mountain and happened to get washed into

9576
02:43:21,750 --> 02:43:21,760
mountain and happened to get washed into
 

9577
02:43:21,760 --> 02:43:23,990
mountain and happened to get washed into

9578
02:43:23,990 --> 02:43:24,000
the ocean
 

9579
02:43:24,000 --> 02:43:25,190
the ocean
yeah so

9580
02:43:25,190 --> 02:43:25,200
yeah so
 

9581
02:43:25,200 --> 02:43:26,870
yeah so
many happy accidents like that are

9582
02:43:26,870 --> 02:43:26,880
many happy accidents like that are
 

9583
02:43:26,880 --> 02:43:28,469
many happy accidents like that are
possible statistically it's really hard

9584
02:43:28,469 --> 02:43:28,479
possible statistically it's really hard
 

9585
02:43:28,479 --> 02:43:30,150
possible statistically it's really hard
you know maybe you can roll that in

9586
02:43:30,150 --> 02:43:30,160
you know maybe you can roll that in
 

9587
02:43:30,160 --> 02:43:32,630
you know maybe you can roll that in
statistically or but this is the course

9588
02:43:32,630 --> 02:43:32,640
statistically or but this is the course
 

9589
02:43:32,640 --> 02:43:34,870
statistically or but this is the course
of life on earth without all that

9590
02:43:34,870 --> 02:43:34,880
of life on earth without all that
 

9591

9593
02:43:36,960 --> 02:43:38,469
sulfate being raised up this cambrian
explosion almost certainly would not

9594
02:43:38,469 --> 02:43:38,479
explosion almost certainly would not
 

9595
02:43:38,479 --> 02:43:39,670
explosion almost certainly would not
have happened

9596
02:43:39,670 --> 02:43:39,680
have happened
 

9597
02:43:39,680 --> 02:43:41,030
have happened
and then we wouldn't have had animals

9598
02:43:41,030 --> 02:43:41,040
and then we wouldn't have had animals
 

9599
02:43:41,040 --> 02:43:42,790
and then we wouldn't have had animals
and and so on and so on so it's you know

9600
02:43:42,790 --> 02:43:42,800
and and so on and so on so it's you know
 

9601
02:43:42,800 --> 02:43:44,309
and and so on and so on so it's you know
it's

9602
02:43:44,309 --> 02:43:44,319
it's
 

9603
02:43:44,319 --> 02:43:45,990
it's
this kind of explanation of the cambrian

9604
02:43:45,990 --> 02:43:46,000
this kind of explanation of the cambrian
 

9605
02:43:46,000 --> 02:43:48,070
this kind of explanation of the cambrian
explosion

9606
02:43:48,070 --> 02:43:48,080
explosion
 

9607
02:43:48,080 --> 02:43:49,429
explosion
so

9608
02:43:49,429 --> 02:43:49,439
so
 

9609
02:43:49,439 --> 02:43:51,750
so
uh let me actually say in several ways

9610
02:43:51,750 --> 02:43:51,760
uh let me actually say in several ways
 

9611
02:43:51,760 --> 02:43:52,950
uh let me actually say in several ways
so

9612
02:43:52,950 --> 02:43:52,960
so
 

9613
02:43:52,960 --> 02:43:55,110
so
you know folks who challenge the

9614
02:43:55,110 --> 02:43:55,120
you know folks who challenge the
 

9615
02:43:55,120 --> 02:43:57,110
you know folks who challenge the
validity of the uh

9616
02:43:57,110 --> 02:43:57,120
validity of the uh
 

9617
02:43:57,120 --> 02:43:59,190
validity of the uh
theory of evolution

9618
02:43:59,190 --> 02:43:59,200
theory of evolution
 

9619
02:43:59,200 --> 02:44:01,670
theory of evolution
will give us an example now i'm not well

9620
02:44:01,670 --> 02:44:01,680
will give us an example now i'm not well
 

9621
02:44:01,680 --> 02:44:03,269
will give us an example now i'm not well
studied in this but we'll give us an

9622
02:44:03,269 --> 02:44:03,279
studied in this but we'll give us an
 

9623
02:44:03,279 --> 02:44:05,429
studied in this but we'll give us an
example the camera and explosion is like

9624
02:44:05,429 --> 02:44:05,439
example the camera and explosion is like
 

9625
02:44:05,439 --> 02:44:07,269
example the camera and explosion is like
this thing is weird

9626
02:44:07,269 --> 02:44:07,279
this thing is weird
 

9627
02:44:07,279 --> 02:44:08,870
this thing is weird
oh i just wait

9628
02:44:08,870 --> 02:44:08,880
oh i just wait
 

9629
02:44:08,880 --> 02:44:09,830
oh i just wait
so

9630
02:44:09,830 --> 02:44:09,840
so
 

9631
02:44:09,840 --> 02:44:11,110
so
by

9632
02:44:11,110 --> 02:44:11,120
by
 

9633
02:44:11,120 --> 02:44:13,030
by
the question i would have

9634
02:44:13,030 --> 02:44:13,040
the question i would have
 

9635
02:44:13,040 --> 02:44:15,670
the question i would have
is what's the biggest mystery

9636
02:44:15,670 --> 02:44:15,680
is what's the biggest mystery
 

9637
02:44:15,680 --> 02:44:19,269
is what's the biggest mystery
or gap in understanding about evolution

9638
02:44:19,269 --> 02:44:19,279
or gap in understanding about evolution
 

9639
02:44:19,279 --> 02:44:21,510
or gap in understanding about evolution
is it the cambrian explosion and if so

9640
02:44:21,510 --> 02:44:21,520
is it the cambrian explosion and if so
 

9641
02:44:21,520 --> 02:44:23,429
is it the cambrian explosion and if so
how do we what's our best understanding

9642
02:44:23,429 --> 02:44:23,439
how do we what's our best understanding
 

9643
02:44:23,439 --> 02:44:25,110
how do we what's our best understanding
of how to explain

9644
02:44:25,110 --> 02:44:25,120
of how to explain
 

9645
02:44:25,120 --> 02:44:28,230
of how to explain
uh first of all what is it

9646
02:44:28,230 --> 02:44:28,240
uh first of all what is it
 

9647
02:44:28,240 --> 02:44:29,910
uh first of all what is it
in my understanding in the short amount

9648
02:44:29,910 --> 02:44:29,920
in my understanding in the short amount
 

9649
02:44:29,920 --> 02:44:31,990
in my understanding in the short amount
of time maybe 10 million years 100

9650
02:44:31,990 --> 02:44:32,000
of time maybe 10 million years 100
 

9651
02:44:32,000 --> 02:44:34,230
of time maybe 10 million years 100
million years something like that a huge

9652
02:44:34,230 --> 02:44:34,240
million years something like that a huge
 

9653
02:44:34,240 --> 02:44:37,269
million years something like that a huge
number of animals a variety diversity of

9654
02:44:37,269 --> 02:44:37,279
number of animals a variety diversity of
 

9655
02:44:37,279 --> 02:44:38,870
number of animals a variety diversity of
animals were created

9656
02:44:38,870 --> 02:44:38,880
animals were created
 

9657
02:44:38,880 --> 02:44:39,670
animals were created
um

9658
02:44:39,670 --> 02:44:39,680
um
 

9659
02:44:39,680 --> 02:44:41,429
um
anyway there's like five questions in

9660
02:44:41,429 --> 02:44:41,439
anyway there's like five questions in
 

9661
02:44:41,439 --> 02:44:43,190
anyway there's like five questions in
there yeah is that the biggest mystery

9662
02:44:43,190 --> 02:44:43,200
there yeah is that the biggest mystery
 

9663
02:44:43,200 --> 02:44:44,550
there yeah is that the biggest mystery
no i don't think that's a particularly

9664
02:44:44,550 --> 02:44:44,560
no i don't think that's a particularly
 

9665
02:44:44,560 --> 02:44:48,630
no i don't think that's a particularly
big mystery really anymore i mean it's

9666
02:44:48,630 --> 02:44:48,640
big mystery really anymore i mean it's
 

9667
02:44:48,640 --> 02:44:51,110
big mystery really anymore i mean it's
there are still mysteries about why then

9668
02:44:51,110 --> 02:44:51,120
there are still mysteries about why then
 

9669
02:44:51,120 --> 02:44:52,790
there are still mysteries about why then
and i've just said sulfate being washed

9670
02:44:52,790 --> 02:44:52,800
and i've just said sulfate being washed
 

9671
02:44:52,800 --> 02:44:54,950
and i've just said sulfate being washed
into the oceans is one it needs oxygen

9672
02:44:54,950 --> 02:44:54,960
into the oceans is one it needs oxygen
 

9673
02:44:54,960 --> 02:44:58,230
into the oceans is one it needs oxygen
and oxygen levels rose around that time

9674
02:44:58,230 --> 02:44:58,240
and oxygen levels rose around that time
 

9675
02:44:58,240 --> 02:45:01,030
and oxygen levels rose around that time
um so probably before that they weren't

9676
02:45:01,030 --> 02:45:01,040
um so probably before that they weren't
 

9677
02:45:01,040 --> 02:45:03,110
um so probably before that they weren't
high enough for animals what we're

9678
02:45:03,110 --> 02:45:03,120
high enough for animals what we're
 

9679
02:45:03,120 --> 02:45:04,790
high enough for animals what we're
seeing with the cambrian explosion is

9680
02:45:04,790 --> 02:45:04,800
seeing with the cambrian explosion is
 

9681
02:45:04,800 --> 02:45:06,070
seeing with the cambrian explosion is
the beginning of

9682
02:45:06,070 --> 02:45:06,080
the beginning of
 

9683
02:45:06,080 --> 02:45:07,990
the beginning of
predators and prey relationships we're

9684
02:45:07,990 --> 02:45:08,000
predators and prey relationships we're
 

9685
02:45:08,000 --> 02:45:10,950
predators and prey relationships we're
seeing we're seeing uh modern ecosystems

9686
02:45:10,950 --> 02:45:10,960
seeing we're seeing uh modern ecosystems
 

9687
02:45:10,960 --> 02:45:13,110
seeing we're seeing uh modern ecosystems
and we're seeing arms races and we're

9688
02:45:13,110 --> 02:45:13,120
and we're seeing arms races and we're
 

9689
02:45:13,120 --> 02:45:15,830
and we're seeing arms races and we're
seeing um

9690
02:45:15,830 --> 02:45:15,840
seeing um
 

9691
02:45:15,840 --> 02:45:17,830
seeing um
we're seeing the full creativity of

9692
02:45:17,830 --> 02:45:17,840
we're seeing the full creativity of
 

9693
02:45:17,840 --> 02:45:19,590
we're seeing the full creativity of
evolution unleashed

9694
02:45:19,590 --> 02:45:19,600
evolution unleashed
 

9695
02:45:19,600 --> 02:45:20,389
evolution unleashed
and the

9696
02:45:20,389 --> 02:45:20,399
and the
 

9697
02:45:20,399 --> 02:45:22,469
and the
so i talked about the boring billion

9698
02:45:22,469 --> 02:45:22,479
so i talked about the boring billion
 

9699
02:45:22,479 --> 02:45:24,870
so i talked about the boring billion
nothing happens for for you know one and

9700
02:45:24,870 --> 02:45:24,880
nothing happens for for you know one and
 

9701
02:45:24,880 --> 02:45:26,630
nothing happens for for you know one and
a half one billion years one and a half

9702
02:45:26,630 --> 02:45:26,640
a half one billion years one and a half
 

9703
02:45:26,640 --> 02:45:29,429
a half one billion years one and a half
billion years um

9704
02:45:29,429 --> 02:45:29,439
billion years um
 

9705
02:45:29,439 --> 02:45:31,429
billion years um
the assumption and this is completely

9706
02:45:31,429 --> 02:45:31,439
the assumption and this is completely
 

9707
02:45:31,439 --> 02:45:33,429
the assumption and this is completely
wrong this assumption is is that then

9708
02:45:33,429 --> 02:45:33,439
wrong this assumption is is that then
 

9709
02:45:33,439 --> 02:45:35,190
wrong this assumption is is that then
that you know evolution works really

9710
02:45:35,190 --> 02:45:35,200
that you know evolution works really
 

9711
02:45:35,200 --> 02:45:37,429
that you know evolution works really
slowly and that you need billions of

9712
02:45:37,429 --> 02:45:37,439
slowly and that you need billions of
 

9713
02:45:37,439 --> 02:45:38,950
slowly and that you need billions of
years to

9714
02:45:38,950 --> 02:45:38,960
years to
 

9715
02:45:38,960 --> 02:45:40,790
years to
affect some small change and then

9716
02:45:40,790 --> 02:45:40,800
affect some small change and then
 

9717
02:45:40,800 --> 02:45:42,230
affect some small change and then
another billion years to do something

9718
02:45:42,230 --> 02:45:42,240
another billion years to do something
 

9719
02:45:42,240 --> 02:45:44,469
another billion years to do something
else it's completely wrong

9720
02:45:44,469 --> 02:45:44,479
else it's completely wrong
 

9721
02:45:44,479 --> 02:45:46,309
else it's completely wrong
evolution gets stuck in a stasis and it

9722
02:45:46,309 --> 02:45:46,319
evolution gets stuck in a stasis and it
 

9723
02:45:46,319 --> 02:45:48,230
evolution gets stuck in a stasis and it
stays that way for tens of millions

9724
02:45:48,230 --> 02:45:48,240
stays that way for tens of millions
 

9725
02:45:48,240 --> 02:45:49,990
stays that way for tens of millions
hundreds of millions of years

9726
02:45:49,990 --> 02:45:50,000
hundreds of millions of years
 

9727
02:45:50,000 --> 02:45:52,150
hundreds of millions of years
uh and stephen j gould used to argue

9728
02:45:52,150 --> 02:45:52,160
uh and stephen j gould used to argue
 

9729
02:45:52,160 --> 02:45:53,830
uh and stephen j gould used to argue
this he called it punctuated equilibrium

9730
02:45:53,830 --> 02:45:53,840
this he called it punctuated equilibrium
 

9731
02:45:53,840 --> 02:45:55,349
this he called it punctuated equilibrium
but he was doing it to do with animals

9732
02:45:55,349 --> 02:45:55,359
but he was doing it to do with animals
 

9733
02:45:55,359 --> 02:45:57,750
but he was doing it to do with animals
and to do with the the last 500 million

9734
02:45:57,750 --> 02:45:57,760
and to do with the the last 500 million
 

9735
02:45:57,760 --> 02:45:59,910
and to do with the the last 500 million
years or so where it's much less obvious

9736
02:45:59,910 --> 02:45:59,920
years or so where it's much less obvious
 

9737
02:45:59,920 --> 02:46:01,190
years or so where it's much less obvious
than if you think about the entire

9738
02:46:01,190 --> 02:46:01,200
than if you think about the entire
 

9739
02:46:01,200 --> 02:46:02,630
than if you think about the entire
planetary history

9740
02:46:02,630 --> 02:46:02,640
planetary history
 

9741
02:46:02,640 --> 02:46:04,150
planetary history
and then you realize that the first two

9742
02:46:04,150 --> 02:46:04,160
and then you realize that the first two
 

9743
02:46:04,160 --> 02:46:06,550
and then you realize that the first two
billion years was bacteria only you have

9744
02:46:06,550 --> 02:46:06,560
billion years was bacteria only you have
 

9745
02:46:06,560 --> 02:46:08,389
billion years was bacteria only you have
the origin of life two billion years of

9746
02:46:08,389 --> 02:46:08,399
the origin of life two billion years of
 

9747
02:46:08,399 --> 02:46:10,870
the origin of life two billion years of
just bacteria oxygenic photosynthesis

9748
02:46:10,870 --> 02:46:10,880
just bacteria oxygenic photosynthesis
 

9749
02:46:10,880 --> 02:46:13,110
just bacteria oxygenic photosynthesis
arising here then you have a

9750
02:46:13,110 --> 02:46:13,120
arising here then you have a
 

9751
02:46:13,120 --> 02:46:15,269
arising here then you have a
global catastrophe snowball earths and

9752
02:46:15,269 --> 02:46:15,279
global catastrophe snowball earths and
 

9753
02:46:15,279 --> 02:46:16,790
global catastrophe snowball earths and
great oxidation events and then another

9754
02:46:16,790 --> 02:46:16,800
great oxidation events and then another
 

9755
02:46:16,800 --> 02:46:18,230
great oxidation events and then another
billion years of nothing happening and

9756
02:46:18,230 --> 02:46:18,240
billion years of nothing happening and
 

9757
02:46:18,240 --> 02:46:20,389
billion years of nothing happening and
then some some period of upheavals and

9758
02:46:20,389 --> 02:46:20,399
then some some period of upheavals and
 

9759
02:46:20,399 --> 02:46:21,830
then some some period of upheavals and
then another snowball earth and then

9760
02:46:21,830 --> 02:46:21,840
then another snowball earth and then
 

9761
02:46:21,840 --> 02:46:23,429
then another snowball earth and then
suddenly you see the cambrian explosion

9762
02:46:23,429 --> 02:46:23,439
suddenly you see the cambrian explosion
 

9763
02:46:23,439 --> 02:46:25,750
suddenly you see the cambrian explosion
this is long periods of stasis

9764
02:46:25,750 --> 02:46:25,760
this is long periods of stasis
 

9765
02:46:25,760 --> 02:46:27,750
this is long periods of stasis
where the world is in a stable state and

9766
02:46:27,750 --> 02:46:27,760
where the world is in a stable state and
 

9767
02:46:27,760 --> 02:46:29,910
where the world is in a stable state and
it's not lean is not geared towards

9768
02:46:29,910 --> 02:46:29,920
it's not lean is not geared towards
 

9769
02:46:29,920 --> 02:46:31,510
it's not lean is not geared towards
increasing complexity it's just

9770
02:46:31,510 --> 02:46:31,520
increasing complexity it's just
 

9771
02:46:31,520 --> 02:46:33,269
increasing complexity it's just
everything is in balance

9772
02:46:33,269 --> 02:46:33,279
everything is in balance
 

9773
02:46:33,279 --> 02:46:35,030
everything is in balance
and only when you have a catastrophic

9774
02:46:35,030 --> 02:46:35,040
and only when you have a catastrophic
 

9775
02:46:35,040 --> 02:46:37,429
and only when you have a catastrophic
level of global level problem like a

9776
02:46:37,429 --> 02:46:37,439
level of global level problem like a
 

9777
02:46:37,439 --> 02:46:39,670
level of global level problem like a
snowball earth it forces everything out

9778
02:46:39,670 --> 02:46:39,680
snowball earth it forces everything out
 

9779
02:46:39,680 --> 02:46:41,190
snowball earth it forces everything out
of balance and there's a tipping point

9780
02:46:41,190 --> 02:46:41,200
of balance and there's a tipping point
 

9781
02:46:41,200 --> 02:46:43,429
of balance and there's a tipping point
and you end up somewhere else now the

9782
02:46:43,429 --> 02:46:43,439
and you end up somewhere else now the
 

9783
02:46:43,439 --> 02:46:45,510
and you end up somewhere else now the
idea that that

9784
02:46:45,510 --> 02:46:45,520
idea that that
 

9785
02:46:45,520 --> 02:46:47,590
idea that that
evolution is slow

9786
02:46:47,590 --> 02:46:47,600
evolution is slow
 

9787
02:46:47,600 --> 02:46:50,630
evolution is slow
is wrong it can be incredibly fast

9788
02:46:50,630 --> 02:46:50,640
is wrong it can be incredibly fast
 

9789
02:46:50,640 --> 02:46:52,710
is wrong it can be incredibly fast
and i mentioned earlier on you can you

9790
02:46:52,710 --> 02:46:52,720
and i mentioned earlier on you can you
 

9791
02:46:52,720 --> 02:46:54,309
and i mentioned earlier on you can you
know in theory it would take half a

9792
02:46:54,309 --> 02:46:54,319
know in theory it would take half a
 

9793
02:46:54,319 --> 02:46:56,230
know in theory it would take half a
million years to invent an eye for

9794
02:46:56,230 --> 02:46:56,240
million years to invent an eye for
 

9795
02:46:56,240 --> 02:46:57,990
million years to invent an eye for
example from a light sensitive spot it

9796
02:46:57,990 --> 02:46:58,000
example from a light sensitive spot it
 

9797
02:46:58,000 --> 02:46:59,590
example from a light sensitive spot it
doesn't take long

9798
02:46:59,590 --> 02:46:59,600
doesn't take long
 

9799
02:46:59,600 --> 02:47:00,870
doesn't take long
to convert

9800
02:47:00,870 --> 02:47:00,880
to convert
 

9801
02:47:00,880 --> 02:47:02,070
to convert
uh you know

9802
02:47:02,070 --> 02:47:02,080
uh you know
 

9803
02:47:02,080 --> 02:47:04,630
uh you know
one one one kind of tube into a tube

9804
02:47:04,630 --> 02:47:04,640
one one one kind of tube into a tube
 

9805
02:47:04,640 --> 02:47:06,389
one one one kind of tube into a tube
with knobbles on it into a tube with

9806
02:47:06,389 --> 02:47:06,399
with knobbles on it into a tube with
 

9807
02:47:06,399 --> 02:47:08,230
with knobbles on it into a tube with
with with arms on it and then multiple

9808
02:47:08,230 --> 02:47:08,240
with with arms on it and then multiple
 

9809
02:47:08,240 --> 02:47:10,230
with with arms on it and then multiple
arms and and then at one end is the head

9810
02:47:10,230 --> 02:47:10,240
arms and and then at one end is the head
 

9811
02:47:10,240 --> 02:47:11,750
arms and and then at one end is the head
where that starts out as a swelling is

9812
02:47:11,750 --> 02:47:11,760
where that starts out as a swelling is
 

9813
02:47:11,760 --> 02:47:12,870
where that starts out as a swelling is
you know it's not

9814
02:47:12,870 --> 02:47:12,880
you know it's not
 

9815
02:47:12,880 --> 02:47:14,710
you know it's not
difficult consider intellectually to

9816
02:47:14,710 --> 02:47:14,720
difficult consider intellectually to
 

9817
02:47:14,720 --> 02:47:17,110
difficult consider intellectually to
understand how these things can happen

9818
02:47:17,110 --> 02:47:17,120
understand how these things can happen
 

9819
02:47:17,120 --> 02:47:18,230
understand how these things can happen
um

9820
02:47:18,230 --> 02:47:18,240
um
 

9821
02:47:18,240 --> 02:47:20,309
um
it boggles the mind that it can happen

9822
02:47:20,309 --> 02:47:20,319
it boggles the mind that it can happen
 

9823
02:47:20,319 --> 02:47:23,110
it boggles the mind that it can happen
so quickly but we're used to

9824
02:47:23,110 --> 02:47:23,120
so quickly but we're used to
 

9825
02:47:23,120 --> 02:47:25,429
so quickly but we're used to
human time scales and what we need to

9826
02:47:25,429 --> 02:47:25,439
human time scales and what we need to
 

9827
02:47:25,439 --> 02:47:27,349
human time scales and what we need to
talk about is generations of things that

9828
02:47:27,349 --> 02:47:27,359
talk about is generations of things that
 

9829
02:47:27,359 --> 02:47:29,910
talk about is generations of things that
live for a year in the ocean

9830
02:47:29,910 --> 02:47:29,920
live for a year in the ocean
 

9831
02:47:29,920 --> 02:47:32,150
live for a year in the ocean
um and and then a million years is a

9832
02:47:32,150 --> 02:47:32,160
um and and then a million years is a
 

9833
02:47:32,160 --> 02:47:34,150
um and and then a million years is a
million generations and the amount of

9834
02:47:34,150 --> 02:47:34,160
million generations and the amount of
 

9835
02:47:34,160 --> 02:47:36,790
million generations and the amount of
change that you can do it can affect in

9836
02:47:36,790 --> 02:47:36,800
change that you can do it can affect in
 

9837
02:47:36,800 --> 02:47:38,950
change that you can do it can affect in
in that period of time is enormous and

9838
02:47:38,950 --> 02:47:38,960
in that period of time is enormous and
 

9839
02:47:38,960 --> 02:47:40,630
in that period of time is enormous and
we're dealing with large populations of

9840
02:47:40,630 --> 02:47:40,640
we're dealing with large populations of
 

9841
02:47:40,640 --> 02:47:42,870
we're dealing with large populations of
things where selection is sensitive to

9842
02:47:42,870 --> 02:47:42,880
things where selection is sensitive to
 

9843
02:47:42,880 --> 02:47:45,190
things where selection is sensitive to
pretty small changes and can

9844
02:47:45,190 --> 02:47:45,200
pretty small changes and can
 

9845
02:47:45,200 --> 02:47:48,309
pretty small changes and can
uh so again what as soon as you throw in

9846
02:47:48,309 --> 02:47:48,319
uh so again what as soon as you throw in
 

9847
02:47:48,319 --> 02:47:50,710
uh so again what as soon as you throw in
the competition of predators and prey

9848
02:47:50,710 --> 02:47:50,720
the competition of predators and prey
 

9849
02:47:50,720 --> 02:47:53,190
the competition of predators and prey
and you're ramping up the the scale of

9850
02:47:53,190 --> 02:47:53,200
and you're ramping up the the scale of
 

9851
02:47:53,200 --> 02:47:54,950
and you're ramping up the the scale of
evolution it's not very surprising that

9852
02:47:54,950 --> 02:47:54,960
evolution it's not very surprising that
 

9853
02:47:54,960 --> 02:47:56,710
evolution it's not very surprising that
it happens very quickly when the

9854
02:47:56,710 --> 02:47:56,720
it happens very quickly when the
 

9855
02:47:56,720 --> 02:47:58,790
it happens very quickly when the
environment allows it to happen so i

9856
02:47:58,790 --> 02:47:58,800
environment allows it to happen so i
 

9857
02:47:58,800 --> 02:47:59,830
environment allows it to happen so i
don't think there's a big mystery

9858
02:47:59,830 --> 02:47:59,840
don't think there's a big mystery
 

9859
02:47:59,840 --> 02:48:02,150
don't think there's a big mystery
there's lots of details that need to be

9860
02:48:02,150 --> 02:48:02,160
there's lots of details that need to be
 

9861
02:48:02,160 --> 02:48:03,269
there's lots of details that need to be
filled in

9862
02:48:03,269 --> 02:48:03,279
filled in
 

9863
02:48:03,279 --> 02:48:06,150
filled in
i mean the big mystery in in biology is

9864
02:48:06,150 --> 02:48:06,160
i mean the big mystery in in biology is
 

9865
02:48:06,160 --> 02:48:11,269
i mean the big mystery in in biology is
consciousness

9866
02:48:11,269 --> 02:48:11,279

 

9867
02:48:11,279 --> 02:48:13,269

the big mystery in biology is conscious

9868
02:48:13,269 --> 02:48:13,279
the big mystery in biology is conscious
 

9869
02:48:13,279 --> 02:48:15,349
the big mystery in biology is conscious
well intelligence is kind of a mystery

9870
02:48:15,349 --> 02:48:15,359
well intelligence is kind of a mystery
 

9871
02:48:15,359 --> 02:48:21,269
well intelligence is kind of a mystery
too

9872
02:48:21,269 --> 02:48:21,279

 

9873
02:48:21,279 --> 02:48:25,910

i mean you said biology not

9874
02:48:25,910 --> 02:48:25,920

 

9875
02:48:25,920 --> 02:48:27,990

psychology

9876
02:48:27,990 --> 02:48:28,000
psychology
 

9877
02:48:28,000 --> 02:48:29,110
psychology
because

9878
02:48:29,110 --> 02:48:29,120
because
 

9879
02:48:29,120 --> 02:48:31,030
because
from a biology perspective it seems like

9880
02:48:31,030 --> 02:48:31,040
from a biology perspective it seems like
 

9881
02:48:31,040 --> 02:48:32,790
from a biology perspective it seems like
intelligence and consciousness all are

9882
02:48:32,790 --> 02:48:32,800
intelligence and consciousness all are
 

9883
02:48:32,800 --> 02:48:35,590
intelligence and consciousness all are
the same like weird

9884
02:48:35,590 --> 02:48:35,600
the same like weird
 

9885
02:48:35,600 --> 02:48:36,389
the same like weird
like

9886
02:48:36,389 --> 02:48:36,399
like
 

9887
02:48:36,399 --> 02:48:39,110
like
all the brain stuff i don't see this

9888
02:48:39,110 --> 02:48:39,120
all the brain stuff i don't see this
 

9889
02:48:39,120 --> 02:48:41,030
all the brain stuff i don't see this
intelligence is necessarily that

9890
02:48:41,030 --> 02:48:41,040
intelligence is necessarily that
 

9891
02:48:41,040 --> 02:48:43,750
intelligence is necessarily that
difficult i suppose i mean i see it as a

9892
02:48:43,750 --> 02:48:43,760
difficult i suppose i mean i see it as a
 

9893
02:48:43,760 --> 02:48:45,349
difficult i suppose i mean i see it as a
form of computing and i don't know much

9894
02:48:45,349 --> 02:48:45,359
form of computing and i don't know much
 

9895
02:48:45,359 --> 02:48:48,389
form of computing and i don't know much
about computing so i

9896
02:48:48,389 --> 02:48:48,399
about computing so i
 

9897
02:48:48,399 --> 02:48:49,830
about computing so i
you don't know much about consciousness

9898
02:48:49,830 --> 02:48:49,840
you don't know much about consciousness
 

9899
02:48:49,840 --> 02:48:52,950
you don't know much about consciousness
either so i i mean i suppose

9900
02:48:52,950 --> 02:48:52,960
either so i i mean i suppose
 

9901
02:48:52,960 --> 02:48:54,230
either so i i mean i suppose
oh i see

9902
02:48:54,230 --> 02:48:54,240
oh i see
 

9903
02:48:54,240 --> 02:48:57,429
oh i see
i see i see acid

9904
02:48:57,429 --> 02:48:57,439
i see i see acid
 

9905
02:48:57,439 --> 02:48:59,110
i see i see acid
that consciousness you do know a lot

9906
02:48:59,110 --> 02:48:59,120
that consciousness you do know a lot
 

9907
02:48:59,120 --> 02:49:01,910
that consciousness you do know a lot
about as a human being no no i mean i i

9908
02:49:01,910 --> 02:49:01,920
about as a human being no no i mean i i
 

9909
02:49:01,920 --> 02:49:04,710
about as a human being no no i mean i i
think i i can understand the wiring of a

9910
02:49:04,710 --> 02:49:04,720
think i i can understand the wiring of a
 

9911
02:49:04,720 --> 02:49:05,750
think i i can understand the wiring of a
brain

9912
02:49:05,750 --> 02:49:05,760
brain
 

9913
02:49:05,760 --> 02:49:08,070
brain
as a series of in pretty much the same

9914
02:49:08,070 --> 02:49:08,080
as a series of in pretty much the same
 

9915
02:49:08,080 --> 02:49:11,510
as a series of in pretty much the same
way as a computer in in theory

9916
02:49:11,510 --> 02:49:11,520
way as a computer in in theory
 

9917
02:49:11,520 --> 02:49:12,630
way as a computer in in theory
um

9918
02:49:12,630 --> 02:49:12,640
um
 

9919
02:49:12,640 --> 02:49:16,550
um
in terms of um the circuitry of it

9920
02:49:16,550 --> 02:49:16,560
in terms of um the circuitry of it
 

9921
02:49:16,560 --> 02:49:17,910
in terms of um the circuitry of it
the mystery

9922
02:49:17,910 --> 02:49:17,920
the mystery
 

9923
02:49:17,920 --> 02:49:19,269
the mystery
to me is

9924
02:49:19,269 --> 02:49:19,279
to me is
 

9925
02:49:19,279 --> 02:49:21,670
to me is
how this system gives rise to feelings

9926
02:49:21,670 --> 02:49:21,680
how this system gives rise to feelings
 

9927
02:49:21,680 --> 02:49:23,269
how this system gives rise to feelings
as we were talking about earlier on yeah

9928
02:49:23,269 --> 02:49:23,279
as we were talking about earlier on yeah
 

9929
02:49:23,279 --> 02:49:24,710
as we were talking about earlier on yeah
i just i think

9930
02:49:24,710 --> 02:49:24,720
i just i think
 

9931
02:49:24,720 --> 02:49:27,030
i just i think
i think we oversimplify

9932
02:49:27,030 --> 02:49:27,040
i think we oversimplify
 

9933
02:49:27,040 --> 02:49:29,910
i think we oversimplify
intelligence i think the dance the magic

9934
02:49:29,910 --> 02:49:29,920
intelligence i think the dance the magic
 

9935
02:49:29,920 --> 02:49:31,830
intelligence i think the dance the magic
of reasoning

9936
02:49:31,830 --> 02:49:31,840
of reasoning
 

9937
02:49:31,840 --> 02:49:34,469
of reasoning
is as interesting as the magic of

9938
02:49:34,469 --> 02:49:34,479
is as interesting as the magic of
 

9939
02:49:34,479 --> 02:49:36,070
is as interesting as the magic of
feeling

9940
02:49:36,070 --> 02:49:36,080
feeling
 

9941
02:49:36,080 --> 02:49:38,389
feeling
we we tend to

9942
02:49:38,389 --> 02:49:38,399
we we tend to
 

9943
02:49:38,399 --> 02:49:40,950
we we tend to
think of reasoning as like

9944
02:49:40,950 --> 02:49:40,960
think of reasoning as like
 

9945
02:49:40,960 --> 02:49:42,469
think of reasoning as like
very uh

9946
02:49:42,469 --> 02:49:42,479
very uh
 

9947
02:49:42,479 --> 02:49:45,269
very uh
running a very simplistic algorithm

9948
02:49:45,269 --> 02:49:45,279
running a very simplistic algorithm
 

9949
02:49:45,279 --> 02:49:47,429
running a very simplistic algorithm
i think reasoning is re the interplay

9950
02:49:47,429 --> 02:49:47,439
i think reasoning is re the interplay
 

9951
02:49:47,439 --> 02:49:49,429
i think reasoning is re the interplay
between memory whatever the hell is

9952
02:49:49,429 --> 02:49:49,439
between memory whatever the hell is
 

9953
02:49:49,439 --> 02:49:51,910
between memory whatever the hell is
going on the unconscious mind

9954
02:49:51,910 --> 02:49:51,920
going on the unconscious mind
 

9955
02:49:51,920 --> 02:49:53,590
going on the unconscious mind
all of that

9956
02:49:53,590 --> 02:49:53,600
all of that
 

9957
02:49:53,600 --> 02:49:55,030
all of that
um

9958
02:49:55,030 --> 02:49:55,040
um
 

9959
02:49:55,040 --> 02:49:56,550
um
i'm not trying to

9960
02:49:56,550 --> 02:49:56,560
i'm not trying to
 

9961
02:49:56,560 --> 02:49:58,870
i'm not trying to
diminish it in any way at all obviously

9962
02:49:58,870 --> 02:49:58,880
diminish it in any way at all obviously
 

9963
02:49:58,880 --> 02:50:01,110
diminish it in any way at all obviously
it's extraordinarily exquisitely complex

9964
02:50:01,110 --> 02:50:01,120
it's extraordinarily exquisitely complex
 

9965
02:50:01,120 --> 02:50:01,830
it's extraordinarily exquisitely complex
and

9966
02:50:01,830 --> 02:50:01,840
and
 

9967
02:50:01,840 --> 02:50:05,030
and
but but i don't see a logical difficulty

9968
02:50:05,030 --> 02:50:05,040
but but i don't see a logical difficulty
 

9969
02:50:05,040 --> 02:50:06,790
but but i don't see a logical difficulty
with how it works

9970
02:50:06,790 --> 02:50:06,800
with how it works
 

9971
02:50:06,800 --> 02:50:08,790
with how it works
yeah no i i mean i agree with you but

9972
02:50:08,790 --> 02:50:08,800
yeah no i i mean i agree with you but
 

9973
02:50:08,800 --> 02:50:10,389
yeah no i i mean i agree with you but
sometimes

9974
02:50:10,389 --> 02:50:10,399
sometimes
 

9975
02:50:10,399 --> 02:50:13,429
sometimes
um yeah there's a big cloak of mystery

9976
02:50:13,429 --> 02:50:13,439
um yeah there's a big cloak of mystery
 

9977
02:50:13,439 --> 02:50:15,830
um yeah there's a big cloak of mystery
around consciousness

9978
02:50:15,830 --> 02:50:15,840
around consciousness
 

9979
02:50:15,840 --> 02:50:17,269
around consciousness
i mean let me compare it with with

9980
02:50:17,269 --> 02:50:17,279
i mean let me compare it with with
 

9981
02:50:17,279 --> 02:50:19,830
i mean let me compare it with with
classical versus quantum physics the

9982
02:50:19,830 --> 02:50:19,840
classical versus quantum physics the
 

9983
02:50:19,840 --> 02:50:21,510
classical versus quantum physics the
classical physics

9984
02:50:21,510 --> 02:50:21,520
classical physics
 

9985
02:50:21,520 --> 02:50:25,670
classical physics
is logical and you can understand

9986
02:50:25,670 --> 02:50:25,680
is logical and you can understand
 

9987
02:50:25,680 --> 02:50:27,510
is logical and you can understand
the the kind of language we're dealing

9988
02:50:27,510 --> 02:50:27,520
the the kind of language we're dealing
 

9989
02:50:27,520 --> 02:50:29,269
the the kind of language we're dealing
with it's almost at the human level

9990
02:50:29,269 --> 02:50:29,279
with it's almost at the human level
 

9991
02:50:29,279 --> 02:50:30,710
with it's almost at the human level
we're dealing with stars and things that

9992
02:50:30,710 --> 02:50:30,720
we're dealing with stars and things that
 

9993
02:50:30,720 --> 02:50:32,150
we're dealing with stars and things that
we can see and when you get to quantum

9994
02:50:32,150 --> 02:50:32,160
we can see and when you get to quantum
 

9995
02:50:32,160 --> 02:50:34,389
we can see and when you get to quantum
mechanics and things

9996
02:50:34,389 --> 02:50:34,399
mechanics and things
 

9997
02:50:34,399 --> 02:50:36,230
mechanics and things
it's practically impossible for the

9998
02:50:36,230 --> 02:50:36,240
it's practically impossible for the
 

9999
02:50:36,240 --> 02:50:38,630
it's practically impossible for the
human mind to compute what is what just

10000
02:50:38,630 --> 02:50:38,640
human mind to compute what is what just
 

10001
02:50:38,640 --> 02:50:41,030
human mind to compute what is what just
happened there yeah um i mean that that

10002
02:50:41,030 --> 02:50:41,040
happened there yeah um i mean that that
 

10003
02:50:41,040 --> 02:50:43,510
happened there yeah um i mean that that
is the same it's like

10004
02:50:43,510 --> 02:50:43,520
is the same it's like
 

10005
02:50:43,520 --> 02:50:45,349
is the same it's like
you understand mathematically the the

10006
02:50:45,349 --> 02:50:45,359
you understand mathematically the the
 

10007
02:50:45,359 --> 02:50:47,750
you understand mathematically the the
notes of a musical composition that's

10008
02:50:47,750 --> 02:50:47,760
notes of a musical composition that's
 

10009
02:50:47,760 --> 02:50:50,070
notes of a musical composition that's
intelligence yes but why makes you feel

10010
02:50:50,070 --> 02:50:50,080
intelligence yes but why makes you feel
 

10011
02:50:50,080 --> 02:50:54,870
intelligence yes but why makes you feel
a certain way

10012
02:50:54,870 --> 02:50:54,880

 

10013
02:50:54,880 --> 02:50:57,429

that is much harder to understand

10014
02:50:57,429 --> 02:50:57,439
that is much harder to understand
 

10015
02:50:57,439 --> 02:50:59,750
that is much harder to understand
yeah that's that's really um

10016
02:50:59,750 --> 02:50:59,760
yeah that's that's really um
 

10017
02:50:59,760 --> 02:51:00,710
yeah that's that's really um
but

10018
02:51:00,710 --> 02:51:00,720
but
 

10019
02:51:00,720 --> 02:51:02,710
but
it was it was interesting framing that

10020
02:51:02,710 --> 02:51:02,720
it was it was interesting framing that
 

10021
02:51:02,720 --> 02:51:04,550
it was it was interesting framing that
that's a mystery at this at the core of

10022
02:51:04,550 --> 02:51:04,560
that's a mystery at this at the core of
 

10023
02:51:04,560 --> 02:51:06,710
that's a mystery at this at the core of
biology i wonder

10024
02:51:06,710 --> 02:51:06,720
biology i wonder
 

10025
02:51:06,720 --> 02:51:09,510
biology i wonder
who solves consciousness

10026
02:51:09,510 --> 02:51:09,520
who solves consciousness
 

10027
02:51:09,520 --> 02:51:11,349
who solves consciousness
i tend to think consciousness will be

10028
02:51:11,349 --> 02:51:11,359
i tend to think consciousness will be
 

10029
02:51:11,359 --> 02:51:13,830
i tend to think consciousness will be
solved by the engineer

10030
02:51:13,830 --> 02:51:13,840
solved by the engineer
 

10031
02:51:13,840 --> 02:51:17,030
solved by the engineer
meaning anything the person builds it

10032
02:51:17,030 --> 02:51:17,040
meaning anything the person builds it
 

10033
02:51:17,040 --> 02:51:18,790
meaning anything the person builds it
who tries keeps trying to build the

10034
02:51:18,790 --> 02:51:18,800
who tries keeps trying to build the
 

10035
02:51:18,800 --> 02:51:19,910
who tries keeps trying to build the
thing

10036
02:51:19,910 --> 02:51:19,920
thing
 

10037
02:51:19,920 --> 02:51:23,110
thing
uh versus biology is such a complicated

10038
02:51:23,110 --> 02:51:23,120
uh versus biology is such a complicated
 

10039
02:51:23,120 --> 02:51:24,790
uh versus biology is such a complicated
system

10040
02:51:24,790 --> 02:51:24,800
system
 

10041
02:51:24,800 --> 02:51:26,710
system
i feel like it's

10042
02:51:26,710 --> 02:51:26,720
i feel like it's
 

10043
02:51:26,720 --> 02:51:29,030
i feel like it's
um i feel like the building blocks of

10044
02:51:29,030 --> 02:51:29,040
um i feel like the building blocks of
 

10045
02:51:29,040 --> 02:51:30,630
um i feel like the building blocks of
consciousness from a biological

10046
02:51:30,630 --> 02:51:30,640
consciousness from a biological
 

10047
02:51:30,640 --> 02:51:32,469
consciousness from a biological
perspective

10048
02:51:32,469 --> 02:51:32,479
perspective
 

10049
02:51:32,479 --> 02:51:33,990
perspective
are like

10050
02:51:33,990 --> 02:51:34,000
are like
 

10051
02:51:34,000 --> 02:51:35,910
are like
that's like the final creation of a

10052
02:51:35,910 --> 02:51:35,920
that's like the final creation of a
 

10053
02:51:35,920 --> 02:51:37,429
that's like the final creation of a
human being so you have to understand

10054
02:51:37,429 --> 02:51:37,439
human being so you have to understand
 

10055
02:51:37,439 --> 02:51:38,790
human being so you have to understand
the whole damn thing

10056
02:51:38,790 --> 02:51:38,800
the whole damn thing
 

10057
02:51:38,800 --> 02:51:41,990
the whole damn thing
you said electrical fields but like

10058
02:51:41,990 --> 02:51:42,000
you said electrical fields but like
 

10059
02:51:42,000 --> 02:51:45,110
you said electrical fields but like
electrical fields plus plus everything

10060
02:51:45,110 --> 02:51:45,120
electrical fields plus plus everything
 

10061
02:51:45,120 --> 02:51:47,110
electrical fields plus plus everything
whole shebang

10062
02:51:47,110 --> 02:51:47,120
whole shebang
 

10063
02:51:47,120 --> 02:51:49,429
whole shebang
i'm inclined to agree i mean my feeling

10064
02:51:49,429 --> 02:51:49,439
i'm inclined to agree i mean my feeling
 

10065
02:51:49,439 --> 02:51:51,910
i'm inclined to agree i mean my feeling
is from my meager knowledge of the

10066
02:51:51,910 --> 02:51:51,920
is from my meager knowledge of the
 

10067
02:51:51,920 --> 02:51:53,349
is from my meager knowledge of the
history of science is that the biggest

10068
02:51:53,349 --> 02:51:53,359
history of science is that the biggest
 

10069
02:51:53,359 --> 02:51:55,110
history of science is that the biggest
breakthroughs usually come through from

10070
02:51:55,110 --> 02:51:55,120
breakthroughs usually come through from
 

10071
02:51:55,120 --> 02:51:58,070
breakthroughs usually come through from
a field that was not related to so so if

10072
02:51:58,070 --> 02:51:58,080
a field that was not related to so so if
 

10073
02:51:58,080 --> 02:51:59,269
a field that was not related to so so if
anyone you know is not going to be a

10074
02:51:59,269 --> 02:51:59,279
anyone you know is not going to be a
 

10075
02:51:59,279 --> 02:52:01,590
anyone you know is not going to be a
biologist who solves consciousness uh

10076
02:52:01,590 --> 02:52:01,600
biologist who solves consciousness uh
 

10077
02:52:01,600 --> 02:52:03,830
biologist who solves consciousness uh
just because biologists are too embedded

10078
02:52:03,830 --> 02:52:03,840
just because biologists are too embedded
 

10079
02:52:03,840 --> 02:52:06,870
just because biologists are too embedded
in in in the nature of of the problem

10080
02:52:06,870 --> 02:52:06,880
in in in the nature of of the problem
 

10081
02:52:06,880 --> 02:52:08,309
in in in the nature of of the problem
and then nobody's going to believe you

10082
02:52:08,309 --> 02:52:08,319
and then nobody's going to believe you
 

10083
02:52:08,319 --> 02:52:09,510
and then nobody's going to believe you
when you've done it because nobody's

10084
02:52:09,510 --> 02:52:09,520
when you've done it because nobody's
 

10085
02:52:09,520 --> 02:52:11,590
when you've done it because nobody's
going to be able to prove that this this

10086
02:52:11,590 --> 02:52:11,600
going to be able to prove that this this
 

10087
02:52:11,600 --> 02:52:15,269
going to be able to prove that this this
ai is in fact conscious and and sad

10088
02:52:15,269 --> 02:52:15,279
ai is in fact conscious and and sad
 

10089
02:52:15,279 --> 02:52:17,110
ai is in fact conscious and and sad
in any case and any more than you can

10090
02:52:17,110 --> 02:52:17,120
in any case and any more than you can
 

10091
02:52:17,120 --> 02:52:19,990
in any case and any more than you can
prove that a dog is conscious and sad

10092
02:52:19,990 --> 02:52:20,000
prove that a dog is conscious and sad
 

10093
02:52:20,000 --> 02:52:22,389
prove that a dog is conscious and sad
so it tells you that it is in good

10094
02:52:22,389 --> 02:52:22,399
so it tells you that it is in good
 

10095
02:52:22,399 --> 02:52:24,710
so it tells you that it is in good
language and you must believe it

10096
02:52:24,710 --> 02:52:24,720
language and you must believe it
 

10097
02:52:24,720 --> 02:52:27,269
language and you must believe it
but i think most people will accept

10098
02:52:27,269 --> 02:52:27,279
but i think most people will accept
 

10099
02:52:27,279 --> 02:52:29,429
but i think most people will accept
if faced with that that

10100
02:52:29,429 --> 02:52:29,439
if faced with that that
 

10101
02:52:29,439 --> 02:52:30,710
if faced with that that
that's what it is

10102
02:52:30,710 --> 02:52:30,720
that's what it is
 

10103
02:52:30,720 --> 02:52:33,910
that's what it is
all of this uh probability though of

10104
02:52:33,910 --> 02:52:33,920
all of this uh probability though of
 

10105
02:52:33,920 --> 02:52:38,469
all of this uh probability though of
complex life

10106
02:52:38,469 --> 02:52:38,479

 

10107
02:52:38,479 --> 02:52:40,150

i in one way i think

10108
02:52:40,150 --> 02:52:40,160
i in one way i think
 

10109
02:52:40,160 --> 02:52:41,590
i in one way i think
why it matters

10110
02:52:41,590 --> 02:52:41,600
why it matters
 

10111
02:52:41,600 --> 02:52:44,389
why it matters
is that

10112
02:52:44,389 --> 02:52:44,399

 

10113
02:52:44,399 --> 02:52:47,190

my expectation i suppose is that we we

10114
02:52:47,190 --> 02:52:47,200
my expectation i suppose is that we we
 

10115
02:52:47,200 --> 02:52:48,309
my expectation i suppose is that we we
will be

10116
02:52:48,309 --> 02:52:48,319
will be
 

10117
02:52:48,319 --> 02:52:49,910
will be
over the next hundred years or so if we

10118
02:52:49,910 --> 02:52:49,920
over the next hundred years or so if we
 

10119
02:52:49,920 --> 02:52:53,190
over the next hundred years or so if we
survive at all that ai will increasingly

10120
02:52:53,190 --> 02:52:53,200
survive at all that ai will increasingly
 

10121
02:52:53,200 --> 02:52:55,269
survive at all that ai will increasingly
dominate and and pretty much anything

10122
02:52:55,269 --> 02:52:55,279
dominate and and pretty much anything
 

10123
02:52:55,279 --> 02:52:57,510
dominate and and pretty much anything
that we put out into space going looking

10124
02:52:57,510 --> 02:52:57,520
that we put out into space going looking
 

10125
02:52:57,520 --> 02:52:59,190
that we put out into space going looking
for other

10126
02:52:59,190 --> 02:52:59,200
for other
 

10127
02:52:59,200 --> 02:53:00,630
for other
well for the universe for what's out

10128
02:53:00,630 --> 02:53:00,640
well for the universe for what's out
 

10129
02:53:00,640 --> 02:53:01,670
well for the universe for what's out
there

10130
02:53:01,670 --> 02:53:01,680
there
 

10131
02:53:01,680 --> 02:53:03,910
there
will be ai won't be won't be us we won't

10132
02:53:03,910 --> 02:53:03,920
will be ai won't be won't be us we won't
 

10133
02:53:03,920 --> 02:53:05,510
will be ai won't be won't be us we won't
be doing that or when we do it'll be on

10134
02:53:05,510 --> 02:53:05,520
be doing that or when we do it'll be on
 

10135
02:53:05,520 --> 02:53:07,269
be doing that or when we do it'll be on
a much more limited scale

10136
02:53:07,269 --> 02:53:07,279
a much more limited scale
 

10137
02:53:07,279 --> 02:53:10,309
a much more limited scale
i i suppose the same would apply to any

10138
02:53:10,309 --> 02:53:10,319
i i suppose the same would apply to any
 

10139
02:53:10,319 --> 02:53:13,590
i i suppose the same would apply to any
alien civilization so perhaps rather

10140
02:53:13,590 --> 02:53:13,600
alien civilization so perhaps rather
 

10141
02:53:13,600 --> 02:53:15,269
alien civilization so perhaps rather
than looking for signs of life out there

10142
02:53:15,269 --> 02:53:15,279
than looking for signs of life out there
 

10143
02:53:15,279 --> 02:53:18,950
than looking for signs of life out there
we should be looking for ai out there

10144
02:53:18,950 --> 02:53:18,960
we should be looking for ai out there
 

10145
02:53:18,960 --> 02:53:21,670
we should be looking for ai out there
but then we face the problem

10146
02:53:21,670 --> 02:53:21,680
but then we face the problem
 

10147
02:53:21,680 --> 02:53:22,870
but then we face the problem
um

10148
02:53:22,870 --> 02:53:22,880
um
 

10149
02:53:22,880 --> 02:53:24,630
um
that's

10150
02:53:24,630 --> 02:53:24,640
that's
 

10151
02:53:24,640 --> 02:53:27,110
that's
i don't see how a planet is going to

10152
02:53:27,110 --> 02:53:27,120
i don't see how a planet is going to
 

10153
02:53:27,120 --> 02:53:29,670
i don't see how a planet is going to
give rise directly to ai

10154
02:53:29,670 --> 02:53:29,680
give rise directly to ai
 

10155
02:53:29,680 --> 02:53:31,269
give rise directly to ai
we can see how a planet can give rise

10156
02:53:31,269 --> 02:53:31,279
we can see how a planet can give rise
 

10157
02:53:31,279 --> 02:53:33,990
we can see how a planet can give rise
directly to organic life

10158
02:53:33,990 --> 02:53:34,000
directly to organic life
 

10159
02:53:34,000 --> 02:53:35,990
directly to organic life
and if the principles that govern the

10160
02:53:35,990 --> 02:53:36,000
and if the principles that govern the
 

10161
02:53:36,000 --> 02:53:37,670
and if the principles that govern the
evolution of life on earth apply to

10162
02:53:37,670 --> 02:53:37,680
evolution of life on earth apply to
 

10163
02:53:37,680 --> 02:53:39,910
evolution of life on earth apply to
other planets as well

10164
02:53:39,910 --> 02:53:39,920
other planets as well
 

10165
02:53:39,920 --> 02:53:42,070
other planets as well
and i think a lot of them would

10166
02:53:42,070 --> 02:53:42,080
and i think a lot of them would
 

10167
02:53:42,080 --> 02:53:43,190
and i think a lot of them would
um

10168
02:53:43,190 --> 02:53:43,200
um
 

10169
02:53:43,200 --> 02:53:45,990
um
then the likelihood of ending up with

10170
02:53:45,990 --> 02:53:46,000
then the likelihood of ending up with
 

10171
02:53:46,000 --> 02:53:47,990
then the likelihood of ending up with
a human-like civilization capable of

10172
02:53:47,990 --> 02:53:48,000
a human-like civilization capable of
 

10173
02:53:48,000 --> 02:53:50,469
a human-like civilization capable of
giving rise to ai in the first place

10174
02:53:50,469 --> 02:53:50,479
giving rise to ai in the first place
 

10175
02:53:50,479 --> 02:53:52,389
giving rise to ai in the first place
is massively limited

10176
02:53:52,389 --> 02:53:52,399
is massively limited
 

10177
02:53:52,399 --> 02:53:53,590
is massively limited
once you've done it once perhaps it

10178
02:53:53,590 --> 02:53:53,600
once you've done it once perhaps it
 

10179
02:53:53,600 --> 02:53:55,830
once you've done it once perhaps it
takes over the universe and maybe uh

10180
02:53:55,830 --> 02:53:55,840
takes over the universe and maybe uh
 

10181
02:53:55,840 --> 02:53:58,309
takes over the universe and maybe uh
maybe there's no issue but it it seems

10182
02:53:58,309 --> 02:53:58,319
maybe there's no issue but it it seems
 

10183
02:53:58,319 --> 02:53:59,990
maybe there's no issue but it it seems
to me that the the the two are

10184
02:53:59,990 --> 02:54:00,000
to me that the the the two are
 

10185
02:54:00,000 --> 02:54:01,590
to me that the the the two are
necessarily linked that are you you're

10186
02:54:01,590 --> 02:54:01,600
necessarily linked that are you you're
 

10187
02:54:01,600 --> 02:54:03,910
necessarily linked that are you you're
not going to just turn a sterile planet

10188
02:54:03,910 --> 02:54:03,920
not going to just turn a sterile planet
 

10189
02:54:03,920 --> 02:54:06,309
not going to just turn a sterile planet
into an ai life form without the

10190
02:54:06,309 --> 02:54:06,319
into an ai life form without the
 

10191
02:54:06,319 --> 02:54:08,950
into an ai life form without the
intermediary of the organics first so

10192
02:54:08,950 --> 02:54:08,960
intermediary of the organics first so
 

10193
02:54:08,960 --> 02:54:11,190
intermediary of the organics first so
you have to run the the the full compute

10194
02:54:11,190 --> 02:54:11,200
you have to run the the the full compute
 

10195
02:54:11,200 --> 02:54:13,349
you have to run the the the full compute
the evolutionary computation with the

10196
02:54:13,349 --> 02:54:13,359
the evolutionary computation with the
 

10197
02:54:13,359 --> 02:54:15,990
the evolutionary computation with the
organics to create ai how does ai

10198
02:54:15,990 --> 02:54:16,000
organics to create ai how does ai
 

10199
02:54:16,000 --> 02:54:18,309
organics to create ai how does ai
bootstrap itself up without the aid if

10200
02:54:18,309 --> 02:54:18,319
bootstrap itself up without the aid if
 

10201
02:54:18,319 --> 02:54:20,389
bootstrap itself up without the aid if
you like of an intelligent designer

10202
02:54:20,389 --> 02:54:20,399
you like of an intelligent designer
 

10203
02:54:20,399 --> 02:54:22,389
you like of an intelligent designer
the origin of ai

10204
02:54:22,389 --> 02:54:22,399
the origin of ai
 

10205
02:54:22,399 --> 02:54:24,870
the origin of ai
is going to have to be in the chemistry

10206
02:54:24,870 --> 02:54:24,880
is going to have to be in the chemistry
 

10207
02:54:24,880 --> 02:54:26,790
is going to have to be in the chemistry
of a planet

10208
02:54:26,790 --> 02:54:26,800
of a planet
 

10209
02:54:26,800 --> 02:54:27,510
of a planet
so

10210
02:54:27,510 --> 02:54:27,520
so
 

10211
02:54:27,520 --> 02:54:29,269
so
but that's that's not a limiting factor

10212
02:54:29,269 --> 02:54:29,279
but that's that's not a limiting factor
 

10213
02:54:29,279 --> 02:54:32,630
but that's that's not a limiting factor
right so i mean so there's let me ask

10214
02:54:32,630 --> 02:54:32,640
right so i mean so there's let me ask
 

10215
02:54:32,640 --> 02:54:35,510
right so i mean so there's let me ask
the fermi paradox question

10216
02:54:35,510 --> 02:54:35,520
the fermi paradox question
 

10217
02:54:35,520 --> 02:54:39,349
the fermi paradox question
let's say we live in this incredibly

10218
02:54:39,349 --> 02:54:39,359
let's say we live in this incredibly
 

10219
02:54:39,359 --> 02:54:42,870
let's say we live in this incredibly
dark and beautiful world of

10220
02:54:42,870 --> 02:54:42,880
dark and beautiful world of
 

10221
02:54:42,880 --> 02:54:44,070
dark and beautiful world of
just

10222
02:54:44,070 --> 02:54:44,080
just
 

10223
02:54:44,080 --> 02:54:46,950
just
billions of planets with bacteria on it

10224
02:54:46,950 --> 02:54:46,960
billions of planets with bacteria on it
 

10225
02:54:46,960 --> 02:54:49,110
billions of planets with bacteria on it
and very few intelligent civilizations

10226
02:54:49,110 --> 02:54:49,120
and very few intelligent civilizations
 

10227
02:54:49,120 --> 02:54:52,630
and very few intelligent civilizations
and yet there's a few out there

10228
02:54:52,630 --> 02:54:52,640
and yet there's a few out there
 

10229
02:54:52,640 --> 02:54:56,070
and yet there's a few out there
why haven't we at scale seen them

10230
02:54:56,070 --> 02:54:56,080
why haven't we at scale seen them
 

10231
02:54:56,080 --> 02:54:57,910
why haven't we at scale seen them
visit us

10232
02:54:57,910 --> 02:54:57,920
visit us
 

10233
02:54:57,920 --> 02:54:59,750
visit us
what's your sense

10234
02:54:59,750 --> 02:54:59,760
what's your sense
 

10235
02:54:59,760 --> 02:55:02,150
what's your sense
is it because they don't exist um

10236
02:55:02,150 --> 02:55:02,160
is it because they don't exist um
 

10237
02:55:02,160 --> 02:55:04,070
is it because they don't exist um
because don't exist in the right part of

10238
02:55:04,070 --> 02:55:04,080
because don't exist in the right part of
 

10239
02:55:04,080 --> 02:55:05,510
because don't exist in the right part of
the universe at the right time that's

10240
02:55:05,510 --> 02:55:05,520
the universe at the right time that's
 

10241
02:55:05,520 --> 02:55:08,230
the universe at the right time that's
the simplest answer for it

10242
02:55:08,230 --> 02:55:08,240
the simplest answer for it
 

10243
02:55:08,240 --> 02:55:09,590
the simplest answer for it
is that the one you find the most

10244
02:55:09,590 --> 02:55:09,600
is that the one you find the most
 

10245
02:55:09,600 --> 02:55:11,190
is that the one you find the most
compelling or is there some other

10246
02:55:11,190 --> 02:55:11,200
compelling or is there some other
 

10247
02:55:11,200 --> 02:55:13,830
compelling or is there some other
explanation

10248
02:55:13,830 --> 02:55:13,840
explanation
 

10249
02:55:13,840 --> 02:55:15,750
explanation
i find that you know it's not that i

10250
02:55:15,750 --> 02:55:15,760
i find that you know it's not that i
 

10251
02:55:15,760 --> 02:55:17,510
i find that you know it's not that i
find it more compelling it's that i find

10252
02:55:17,510 --> 02:55:17,520
find it more compelling it's that i find
 

10253
02:55:17,520 --> 02:55:20,950
find it more compelling it's that i find
more probable uh and i find all of them

10254
02:55:20,950 --> 02:55:20,960
more probable uh and i find all of them
 

10255
02:55:20,960 --> 02:55:22,309
more probable uh and i find all of them
i mean there's a lot of hand waving in

10256
02:55:22,309 --> 02:55:22,319
i mean there's a lot of hand waving in
 

10257
02:55:22,319 --> 02:55:23,910
i mean there's a lot of hand waving in
this we just don't know

10258
02:55:23,910 --> 02:55:23,920
this we just don't know
 

10259
02:55:23,920 --> 02:55:26,389
this we just don't know
uh so so i'm trying to read out from

10260
02:55:26,389 --> 02:55:26,399
uh so so i'm trying to read out from
 

10261
02:55:26,399 --> 02:55:28,309
uh so so i'm trying to read out from
what i know about life on earth to what

10262
02:55:28,309 --> 02:55:28,319
what i know about life on earth to what
 

10263
02:55:28,319 --> 02:55:30,389
what i know about life on earth to what
might happen somewhere else

10264
02:55:30,389 --> 02:55:30,399
might happen somewhere else
 

10265
02:55:30,399 --> 02:55:32,389
might happen somewhere else
and it gives to my mind a bit of a

10266
02:55:32,389 --> 02:55:32,399
and it gives to my mind a bit of a
 

10267
02:55:32,399 --> 02:55:34,710
and it gives to my mind a bit of a
pessimistic view of bacteria everywhere

10268
02:55:34,710 --> 02:55:34,720
pessimistic view of bacteria everywhere
 

10269
02:55:34,720 --> 02:55:37,349
pessimistic view of bacteria everywhere
and only occasional intelligent life

10270
02:55:37,349 --> 02:55:37,359
and only occasional intelligent life
 

10271
02:55:37,359 --> 02:55:39,910
and only occasional intelligent life
and you know running forward humans only

10272
02:55:39,910 --> 02:55:39,920
and you know running forward humans only
 

10273
02:55:39,920 --> 02:55:41,670
and you know running forward humans only
once on earth and nothing else that you

10274
02:55:41,670 --> 02:55:41,680
once on earth and nothing else that you
 

10275
02:55:41,680 --> 02:55:43,349
once on earth and nothing else that you
would necessarily be

10276
02:55:43,349 --> 02:55:43,359
would necessarily be
 

10277
02:55:43,359 --> 02:55:45,030
would necessarily be
any more excited about making contact

10278
02:55:45,030 --> 02:55:45,040
any more excited about making contact
 

10279
02:55:45,040 --> 02:55:46,309
any more excited about making contact
with than you would be making contact

10280
02:55:46,309 --> 02:55:46,319
with than you would be making contact
 

10281
02:55:46,319 --> 02:55:49,110
with than you would be making contact
with them on earth

10282
02:55:49,110 --> 02:55:49,120

 

10283
02:55:49,120 --> 02:55:49,990

so

10284
02:55:49,990 --> 02:55:50,000
so
 

10285
02:55:50,000 --> 02:55:51,269
so
so i think the chances are pretty

10286
02:55:51,269 --> 02:55:51,279
so i think the chances are pretty
 

10287
02:55:51,279 --> 02:55:52,389
so i think the chances are pretty
limited

10288
02:55:52,389 --> 02:55:52,399
limited
 

10289
02:55:52,399 --> 02:55:55,429
limited
and the chances of us surviving

10290
02:55:55,429 --> 02:55:55,439
and the chances of us surviving
 

10291
02:55:55,439 --> 02:55:57,110
and the chances of us surviving
is pretty limited too the way we're

10292
02:55:57,110 --> 02:55:57,120
is pretty limited too the way we're
 

10293
02:55:57,120 --> 02:55:58,790
is pretty limited too the way we're
going on at the moment the likelihood of

10294
02:55:58,790 --> 02:55:58,800
going on at the moment the likelihood of
 

10295
02:55:58,800 --> 02:56:02,070
going on at the moment the likelihood of
us not making ourselves extinct within

10296
02:56:02,070 --> 02:56:02,080
us not making ourselves extinct within
 

10297
02:56:02,080 --> 02:56:03,830
us not making ourselves extinct within
the next few hundred years

10298
02:56:03,830 --> 02:56:03,840
the next few hundred years
 

10299
02:56:03,840 --> 02:56:05,830
the next few hundred years
possibly within the next 50 or 100 years

10300
02:56:05,830 --> 02:56:05,840
possibly within the next 50 or 100 years
 

10301
02:56:05,840 --> 02:56:06,710
possibly within the next 50 or 100 years
seems

10302
02:56:06,710 --> 02:56:06,720
seems
 

10303
02:56:06,720 --> 02:56:08,070
seems
quite small

10304
02:56:08,070 --> 02:56:08,080
quite small
 

10305
02:56:08,080 --> 02:56:10,070
quite small
i hope we can do better than that

10306
02:56:10,070 --> 02:56:10,080
i hope we can do better than that
 

10307
02:56:10,080 --> 02:56:11,110
i hope we can do better than that
um

10308
02:56:11,110 --> 02:56:11,120
um
 

10309
02:56:11,120 --> 02:56:12,230
um
so maybe the only thing that will

10310
02:56:12,230 --> 02:56:12,240
so maybe the only thing that will
 

10311
02:56:12,240 --> 02:56:14,070
so maybe the only thing that will
survive from humanity will be ai and

10312
02:56:14,070 --> 02:56:14,080
survive from humanity will be ai and
 

10313
02:56:14,080 --> 02:56:15,910
survive from humanity will be ai and
maybe once it exists and once it's

10314
02:56:15,910 --> 02:56:15,920
maybe once it exists and once it's
 

10315
02:56:15,920 --> 02:56:17,510
maybe once it exists and once it's
capable of

10316
02:56:17,510 --> 02:56:17,520
capable of
 

10317
02:56:17,520 --> 02:56:19,349
capable of
of effectively copying itself and

10318
02:56:19,349 --> 02:56:19,359
of effectively copying itself and
 

10319
02:56:19,359 --> 02:56:21,269
of effectively copying itself and
cutting humans out of the loop

10320
02:56:21,269 --> 02:56:21,279
cutting humans out of the loop
 

10321
02:56:21,279 --> 02:56:23,269
cutting humans out of the loop
um then maybe that will take over the

10322
02:56:23,269 --> 02:56:23,279
um then maybe that will take over the
 

10323
02:56:23,279 --> 02:56:24,389
um then maybe that will take over the
universe

10324
02:56:24,389 --> 02:56:24,399
universe
 

10325
02:56:24,399 --> 02:56:25,830
universe
i mean there's a kind of inherent

10326
02:56:25,830 --> 02:56:25,840
i mean there's a kind of inherent
 

10327
02:56:25,840 --> 02:56:28,150
i mean there's a kind of inherent
sadness to the way you describe that but

10328
02:56:28,150 --> 02:56:28,160
sadness to the way you describe that but
 

10329
02:56:28,160 --> 02:56:30,309
sadness to the way you describe that but
isn't that

10330
02:56:30,309 --> 02:56:30,319
isn't that
 

10331
02:56:30,319 --> 02:56:32,150
isn't that
also potentially beautiful that that's

10332
02:56:32,150 --> 02:56:32,160
also potentially beautiful that that's
 

10333
02:56:32,160 --> 02:56:34,710
also potentially beautiful that that's
the next step of life

10334
02:56:34,710 --> 02:56:34,720
the next step of life
 

10335
02:56:34,720 --> 02:56:35,670
the next step of life
um

10336
02:56:35,670 --> 02:56:35,680
um
 

10337
02:56:35,680 --> 02:56:37,750
um
i suppose as

10338
02:56:37,750 --> 02:56:37,760
i suppose as
 

10339
02:56:37,760 --> 02:56:39,110
i suppose as
from your perspective as long as it

10340
02:56:39,110 --> 02:56:39,120
from your perspective as long as it
 

10341
02:56:39,120 --> 02:56:40,710
from your perspective as long as it
carries the flame of consciousness

10342
02:56:40,710 --> 02:56:40,720
carries the flame of consciousness
 

10343
02:56:40,720 --> 02:56:42,550
carries the flame of consciousness
somehow i think yes there can be some

10344
02:56:42,550 --> 02:56:42,560
somehow i think yes there can be some
 

10345
02:56:42,560 --> 02:56:44,389
somehow i think yes there can be some
beauty to it being the next step of life

10346
02:56:44,389 --> 02:56:44,399
beauty to it being the next step of life
 

10347
02:56:44,399 --> 02:56:45,510
beauty to it being the next step of life
and i don't know if consciousness

10348
02:56:45,510 --> 02:56:45,520
and i don't know if consciousness
 

10349
02:56:45,520 --> 02:56:47,269
and i don't know if consciousness
matters or not from that point of view

10350
02:56:47,269 --> 02:56:47,279
matters or not from that point of view
 

10351
02:56:47,279 --> 02:56:48,550
matters or not from that point of view
to be honest with you

10352
02:56:48,550 --> 02:56:48,560
to be honest with you
 

10353
02:56:48,560 --> 02:56:49,670
to be honest with you
um

10354
02:56:49,670 --> 02:56:49,680
um
 

10355
02:56:49,680 --> 02:56:51,429
um
yeah but there's

10356
02:56:51,429 --> 02:56:51,439
yeah but there's
 

10357
02:56:51,439 --> 02:56:53,110
yeah but there's
there's some sadness yes probably

10358
02:56:53,110 --> 02:56:53,120
there's some sadness yes probably
 

10359
02:56:53,120 --> 02:56:54,389
there's some sadness yes probably
because

10360
02:56:54,389 --> 02:56:54,399
because
 

10361
02:56:54,399 --> 02:56:55,990
because
um

10362
02:56:55,990 --> 02:56:56,000
um
 

10363
02:56:56,000 --> 02:56:57,429
um
because i think it comes down to the

10364
02:56:57,429 --> 02:56:57,439
because i think it comes down to the
 

10365
02:56:57,439 --> 02:56:58,710
because i think it comes down to the
selfishness that we were talking about

10366
02:56:58,710 --> 02:56:58,720
selfishness that we were talking about
 

10367
02:56:58,720 --> 02:57:00,710
selfishness that we were talking about
earlier on i i am

10368
02:57:00,710 --> 02:57:00,720
earlier on i i am
 

10369
02:57:00,720 --> 02:57:02,150
earlier on i i am
an individual

10370
02:57:02,150 --> 02:57:02,160
an individual
 

10371
02:57:02,160 --> 02:57:04,630
an individual
with a a desire not to be kind of

10372
02:57:04,630 --> 02:57:04,640
with a a desire not to be kind of
 

10373
02:57:04,640 --> 02:57:07,429
with a a desire not to be kind of
displaced from life i want to stay alive

10374
02:57:07,429 --> 02:57:07,439
displaced from life i want to stay alive
 

10375
02:57:07,439 --> 02:57:09,110
displaced from life i want to stay alive
i want to

10376
02:57:09,110 --> 02:57:09,120
i want to
 

10377
02:57:09,120 --> 02:57:10,230
i want to
be here

10378
02:57:10,230 --> 02:57:10,240
be here
 

10379
02:57:10,240 --> 02:57:11,429
be here
um

10380
02:57:11,429 --> 02:57:11,439
um
 

10381
02:57:11,439 --> 02:57:12,870
um
so i suppose the threat that a lot of

10382
02:57:12,870 --> 02:57:12,880
so i suppose the threat that a lot of
 

10383
02:57:12,880 --> 02:57:14,389
so i suppose the threat that a lot of
people would feel is that we will just

10384
02:57:14,389 --> 02:57:14,399
people would feel is that we will just
 

10385
02:57:14,399 --> 02:57:17,190
people would feel is that we will just
be wiped out so that we will be um that

10386
02:57:17,190 --> 02:57:17,200
be wiped out so that we will be um that
 

10387
02:57:17,200 --> 02:57:18,550
be wiped out so that we will be um that
there will be potential conflicts

10388
02:57:18,550 --> 02:57:18,560
there will be potential conflicts
 

10389
02:57:18,560 --> 02:57:21,830
there will be potential conflicts
between ai and humans and that that hey

10390
02:57:21,830 --> 02:57:21,840
between ai and humans and that that hey
 

10391
02:57:21,840 --> 02:57:25,269
between ai and humans and that that hey
i will win because it's a lot smarter

10392
02:57:25,269 --> 02:57:25,279
i will win because it's a lot smarter
 

10393
02:57:25,279 --> 02:57:27,750
i will win because it's a lot smarter
boy would that be a sad state of affairs

10394
02:57:27,750 --> 02:57:27,760
boy would that be a sad state of affairs
 

10395
02:57:27,760 --> 02:57:28,630
boy would that be a sad state of affairs
if

10396
02:57:28,630 --> 02:57:28,640
if
 

10397
02:57:28,640 --> 02:57:30,790
if
consciousness is just an intermediate

10398
02:57:30,790 --> 02:57:30,800
consciousness is just an intermediate
 

10399
02:57:30,800 --> 02:57:32,389
consciousness is just an intermediate
stage

10400
02:57:32,389 --> 02:57:32,399
stage
 

10401
02:57:32,399 --> 02:57:36,790
stage
between bacteria and a.i

10402
02:57:36,790 --> 02:57:36,800
between bacteria and a.i
 

10403
02:57:36,800 --> 02:57:38,150
between bacteria and a.i
so i would see bacteria as being

10404
02:57:38,150 --> 02:57:38,160
so i would see bacteria as being
 

10405
02:57:38,160 --> 02:57:39,990
so i would see bacteria as being
potentially a kind of primitive form of

10406
02:57:39,990 --> 02:57:40,000
potentially a kind of primitive form of
 

10407
02:57:40,000 --> 02:57:41,910
potentially a kind of primitive form of
consciousness right so maybe the whole

10408
02:57:41,910 --> 02:57:41,920
consciousness right so maybe the whole
 

10409
02:57:41,920 --> 02:57:43,830
consciousness right so maybe the whole
of life on earth to my mind is conscious

10410
02:57:43,830 --> 02:57:43,840
of life on earth to my mind is conscious
 

10411
02:57:43,840 --> 02:57:46,630
of life on earth to my mind is conscious
it's capable of some form of feelings in

10412
02:57:46,630 --> 02:57:46,640
it's capable of some form of feelings in
 

10413
02:57:46,640 --> 02:57:47,990
it's capable of some form of feelings in
response to the environment that's not

10414
02:57:47,990 --> 02:57:48,000
response to the environment that's not
 

10415
02:57:48,000 --> 02:57:49,750
response to the environment that's not
to say it's intelligent though he's

10416
02:57:49,750 --> 02:57:49,760
to say it's intelligent though he's
 

10417
02:57:49,760 --> 02:57:50,950
to say it's intelligent though he's
got his own

10418
02:57:50,950 --> 02:57:50,960
got his own
 

10419
02:57:50,960 --> 02:57:53,030
got his own
algorithms for intelligence but nothing

10420
02:57:53,030 --> 02:57:53,040
algorithms for intelligence but nothing
 

10421
02:57:53,040 --> 02:57:55,030
algorithms for intelligence but nothing
comparable with us

10422
02:57:55,030 --> 02:57:55,040
comparable with us
 

10423
02:57:55,040 --> 02:57:56,550
comparable with us
i think it's beautiful what a planet

10424
02:57:56,550 --> 02:57:56,560
i think it's beautiful what a planet
 

10425
02:57:56,560 --> 02:57:58,469
i think it's beautiful what a planet
what a sterile planet can come up with

10426
02:57:58,469 --> 02:57:58,479
what a sterile planet can come up with
 

10427
02:57:58,479 --> 02:58:00,309
what a sterile planet can come up with
and it's astonishing that it's come up

10428
02:58:00,309 --> 02:58:00,319
and it's astonishing that it's come up
 

10429
02:58:00,319 --> 02:58:02,070
and it's astonishing that it's come up
with all of this stuff that we see

10430
02:58:02,070 --> 02:58:02,080
with all of this stuff that we see
 

10431
02:58:02,080 --> 02:58:05,750
with all of this stuff that we see
around us and and that either we

10432
02:58:05,750 --> 02:58:05,760
around us and and that either we
 

10433
02:58:05,760 --> 02:58:07,670
around us and and that either we
or whatever we produce is capable of

10434
02:58:07,670 --> 02:58:07,680
or whatever we produce is capable of
 

10435
02:58:07,680 --> 02:58:09,429
or whatever we produce is capable of
destroying all of that

10436
02:58:09,429 --> 02:58:09,439
destroying all of that
 

10437
02:58:09,439 --> 02:58:12,230
destroying all of that
yeah is it is a sad thought

10438
02:58:12,230 --> 02:58:12,240
yeah is it is a sad thought
 

10439
02:58:12,240 --> 02:58:15,510
yeah is it is a sad thought
but it's also

10440
02:58:15,510 --> 02:58:15,520

 

10441
02:58:15,520 --> 02:58:17,349

it's hugely pessimistic

10442
02:58:17,349 --> 02:58:17,359
it's hugely pessimistic
 

10443
02:58:17,359 --> 02:58:19,110
it's hugely pessimistic
i'd like to think that we're capable of

10444
02:58:19,110 --> 02:58:19,120
i'd like to think that we're capable of
 

10445
02:58:19,120 --> 02:58:20,870
i'd like to think that we're capable of
giving rise to something which is at

10446
02:58:20,870 --> 02:58:20,880
giving rise to something which is at
 

10447
02:58:20,880 --> 02:58:22,710
giving rise to something which is at
least as good if not better than us as

10448
02:58:22,710 --> 02:58:22,720
least as good if not better than us as
 

10449
02:58:22,720 --> 02:58:24,070
least as good if not better than us as

10451
02:58:24,080 --> 02:58:25,460

yeah i i have that same

02:58:28,630 --> 02:58:28,640
i have the same optimism
 

10457
02:58:28,640 --> 02:58:30,389
i have the same optimism
especially a thing that is able to

10458
02:58:30,389 --> 02:58:30,399
especially a thing that is able to
 

10459
02:58:30,399 --> 02:58:31,910
especially a thing that is able to
propagate throughout the universe more

10460
02:58:31,910 --> 02:58:31,920
propagate throughout the universe more
 

10461
02:58:31,920 --> 02:58:33,670
propagate throughout the universe more
efficiently than humans can

some merger with ai in humans
 

10467
02:58:39,200 --> 02:58:41,910
some merger with ai in humans
whether that comes from

02:58:41,910 --> 02:58:41,920
whether that comes from
 

10469
02:58:41,920 --> 02:58:43,910
whether that comes from
bioengineering of the human body to

10470
02:58:43,910 --> 02:58:43,920
bioengineering of the human body to
 

10471
02:58:43,920 --> 02:58:45,510
bioengineering of the human body to
extend its life

10472

extend its life
 

10473
02:58:45,520 --> 02:58:46,950
extend its life
somehow

10474
02:58:46,950 --> 02:58:46,960
somehow
 

10475
02:58:46,960 --> 02:58:49,110
somehow
to carry that flame of consciousness and

10476
02:58:49,110 --> 02:58:49,120
to carry that flame of consciousness and
 

10477
02:58:49,120 --> 02:58:51,510
to carry that flame of consciousness and
that personality and the beautiful

10478
02:58:51,510 --> 02:58:51,520
that personality and the beautiful
 

10479
02:58:51,520 --> 02:58:52,630
that personality and the beautiful
tension

tension
 

10481
02:58:52,640 --> 02:58:54,950
tension
that's within all of us carry that

10482
02:58:54,950 --> 02:58:54,960
that's within all of us carry that
 

10483
02:58:54,960 --> 02:58:57,030
that's within all of us carry that
through to multiple planets to multiple

solar systems
all out there in the universe i mean

10488
02:58:59,670 --> 02:58:59,680
all out there in the universe i mean
 

10489
02:58:59,680 --> 02:59:01,590
all out there in the universe i mean
that's a beautiful that's a beautiful

10490
02:59:01,590 --> 02:59:01,600
that's a beautiful that's a beautiful
 

10491
02:59:01,600 --> 02:59:04,150
that's a beautiful that's a beautiful
vision whether ai can do that or

10492
02:59:04,150 --> 02:59:04,160
vision whether ai can do that or
 

10493
02:59:04,160 --> 02:59:06,950
vision whether ai can do that or
uh bioengineered humans

10494
02:59:06,950 --> 02:59:06,960
uh bioengineered humans
 

10495
02:59:06,960 --> 02:59:09,030
uh bioengineered humans
uh can that's an exciting possibility

10496
02:59:09,030 --> 02:59:09,040
uh can that's an exciting possibility
 

10497
02:59:09,040 --> 02:59:11,750
uh can that's an exciting possibility
and especially meeting other

10498
02:59:11,750 --> 02:59:11,760
and especially meeting other
 

10499
02:59:11,760 --> 02:59:13,670
and especially meeting other
other alien civilizations in that same

10500
02:59:13,670 --> 02:59:13,680
other alien civilizations in that same
 

10501
02:59:13,680 --> 02:59:15,190
other alien civilizations in that same
kind of way do you think do you think

10502
02:59:15,190 --> 02:59:15,200
kind of way do you think do you think
 

10503
02:59:15,200 --> 02:59:17,110
kind of way do you think do you think
aliens have consciousness if they're

10504
02:59:17,110 --> 02:59:17,120
aliens have consciousness if they're
 

10505
02:59:17,120 --> 02:59:18,230
aliens have consciousness if they're
organic

10506
02:59:18,230 --> 02:59:18,240
organic
 

10507
02:59:18,240 --> 02:59:20,469
organic
so organic yes connected to caution i

10508
02:59:20,469 --> 02:59:20,479
so organic yes connected to caution i
 

10509
02:59:20,479 --> 02:59:22,870
so organic yes connected to caution i
mean i i think any any system which is

10510
02:59:22,870 --> 02:59:22,880
mean i i think any any system which is
 

10511
02:59:22,880 --> 02:59:26,230
mean i i think any any system which is
going to bootstrap itself up from

10512
02:59:26,230 --> 02:59:26,240
going to bootstrap itself up from
 

10513
02:59:26,240 --> 02:59:29,590
going to bootstrap itself up from
planetary origins i mean

10514
02:59:29,590 --> 02:59:29,600
planetary origins i mean
 

10515
02:59:29,600 --> 02:59:31,030
planetary origins i mean
let me finish this and then come onto

10516
02:59:31,030 --> 02:59:31,040
let me finish this and then come onto
 

10517
02:59:31,040 --> 02:59:32,469
let me finish this and then come onto
something else but uh from from

10518
02:59:32,469 --> 02:59:32,479
something else but uh from from
 

10519
02:59:32,479 --> 02:59:34,710
something else but uh from from
planetary origins is going to face

10520
02:59:34,710 --> 02:59:34,720
planetary origins is going to face
 

10521
02:59:34,720 --> 02:59:36,230
planetary origins is going to face
similar constraints and those

10522
02:59:36,230 --> 02:59:36,240
similar constraints and those
 

10523
02:59:36,240 --> 02:59:38,150
similar constraints and those
constraints are going to be addressed in

10524
02:59:38,150 --> 02:59:38,160
constraints are going to be addressed in
 

10525
02:59:38,160 --> 02:59:40,389
constraints are going to be addressed in
similar basic engineering ways and i

10526
02:59:40,389 --> 02:59:40,399
similar basic engineering ways and i
 

10527
02:59:40,399 --> 02:59:42,230
similar basic engineering ways and i
think it will be cellular and i think it

10528
02:59:42,230 --> 02:59:42,240
think it will be cellular and i think it
 

10529
02:59:42,240 --> 02:59:44,150
think it will be cellular and i think it
will have electrical charges and i think

10530
02:59:44,150 --> 02:59:44,160
will have electrical charges and i think
 

10531
02:59:44,160 --> 02:59:45,510
will have electrical charges and i think
it will have to

10532
02:59:45,510 --> 02:59:45,520
it will have to
 

10533
02:59:45,520 --> 02:59:47,590
it will have to
be selected in populations over time and

10534
02:59:47,590 --> 02:59:47,600
be selected in populations over time and
 

10535
02:59:47,600 --> 02:59:48,950
be selected in populations over time and
all of these things will tend to give

10536
02:59:48,950 --> 02:59:48,960
all of these things will tend to give
 

10537
02:59:48,960 --> 02:59:50,469
all of these things will tend to give
rise to the same processes as the

10538
02:59:50,469 --> 02:59:50,479
rise to the same processes as the
 

10539
02:59:50,479 --> 02:59:53,349
rise to the same processes as the
simplest fix to a difficult problem so i

10540
02:59:53,349 --> 02:59:53,359
simplest fix to a difficult problem so i
 

10541
02:59:53,359 --> 02:59:54,870
simplest fix to a difficult problem so i
would expect it to be conscious yes and

10542
02:59:54,870 --> 02:59:54,880
would expect it to be conscious yes and
 

10543
02:59:54,880 --> 02:59:56,630
would expect it to be conscious yes and
i would expect it to

10544
02:59:56,630 --> 02:59:56,640
i would expect it to
 

10545
02:59:56,640 --> 02:59:58,950
i would expect it to
resemble life on earth in

10546
02:59:58,950 --> 02:59:58,960
resemble life on earth in
 

10547
02:59:58,960 --> 03:00:00,389
resemble life on earth in
many ways

i was a budding biologist at the time
 

10559
03:00:11,279 --> 03:00:12,550
i was a budding biologist at the time

and this was the first time i'd come
 

10561
03:00:12,560 --> 03:00:14,150

you're you are far too parochial you you
know you're thinking about life as

how limited my thinking was

how limited my thinking was
 

10587

how limited my thinking was
uh how how

10588

uh how how
 

10589
03:00:41,680 --> 03:00:43,910
uh how how
narrow-minded i was being and he was it

10729
03:03:07,120 --> 03:03:07,750
do you get well what you're going to get
is

10730
03:03:07,750 --> 03:03:07,760

03:03:09,750 --> 03:03:09,760
carboxylic acids then amino acids it's
 

10733
03:03:09,760 --> 03:03:12,230
carboxylic acids then amino acids it's
quite hard to make nucleotides

10734

quite hard to make nucleotides
 

10735
03:03:12,240 --> 03:03:14,070
quite hard to make nucleotides
um and

10736
03:03:14,070 --> 03:03:14,080
um and
 

10737
03:03:14,080 --> 03:03:15,510
um and
it's possible to make them and it's been

10738
03:03:15,510 --> 03:03:15,520
it's possible to make them and it's been

it's possible to make them and it's been

done and it's being done following this
 

10741
03:03:16,880 --> 03:03:18,870
done and it's being done following this
pathway as well but you make trace

10742
03:03:18,870 --> 03:03:18,880
pathway as well but you make trace
 

10743
03:03:18,880 --> 03:03:19,910

and so the next question assuming that

03:03:21,830 --> 03:03:21,840
and so the next question assuming that
 

10747
03:03:21,840 --> 03:03:23,429
and so the next question assuming that
this is the right way of seeing the

this is the right way of seeing the
 

10749
03:03:23,439 --> 03:03:25,030
this is the right way of seeing the
question which maybe it's just not but

10750
03:03:25,030 --> 03:03:25,040
question which maybe it's just not but
 

10751
03:03:25,040 --> 03:03:26,469
question which maybe it's just not but
let's assume it is

10752
03:03:26,469 --> 03:03:26,479
let's assume it is
 

10753
03:03:26,479 --> 03:03:28,630
let's assume it is
is well how do you reliably make more

10754
03:03:28,630 --> 03:03:28,640
is well how do you reliably make more
 

10755
03:03:28,640 --> 03:03:30,550
is well how do you reliably make more
nucleotides and how do you become more

10756
03:03:30,550 --> 03:03:30,560
nucleotides and how do you become more
 

10757
03:03:30,560 --> 03:03:32,389
nucleotides and how do you become more
complex and better at

10758
03:03:32,389 --> 03:03:32,399
complex and better at
 

10759
03:03:32,399 --> 03:03:34,950
complex and better at
becoming a nucleotide generating machine

10760
03:03:34,950 --> 03:03:34,960
becoming a nucleotide generating machine
 

10761
03:03:34,960 --> 03:03:36,790
becoming a nucleotide generating machine
and the answer is well you need positive

10762
03:03:36,790 --> 03:03:36,800
and the answer is well you need positive
 

10763
03:03:36,800 --> 03:03:38,309
and the answer is well you need positive
feedback loops

10764
03:03:38,309 --> 03:03:38,319
feedback loops
 

10765
03:03:38,319 --> 03:03:40,870
feedback loops
some form of auto catalysis so

10766
03:03:40,870 --> 03:03:40,880
some form of auto catalysis so
 

10767
03:03:40,880 --> 03:03:42,389
some form of auto catalysis so
that can work and we know it happens in

10768
03:03:42,389 --> 03:03:42,399
that can work and we know it happens in
 

10769
03:03:42,399 --> 03:03:45,990
that can work and we know it happens in
biology if this nucleotide for example

10770
03:03:45,990 --> 03:03:46,000
biology if this nucleotide for example
 

10771
03:03:46,000 --> 03:03:49,030
biology if this nucleotide for example
catalyzes co2 fixation then you're going

10772
03:03:49,030 --> 03:03:49,040
catalyzes co2 fixation then you're going
 

10773
03:03:49,040 --> 03:03:50,389
catalyzes co2 fixation then you're going
to increase the rate of flux through the

10774
03:03:50,389 --> 03:03:50,399
to increase the rate of flux through the
 

10775
03:03:50,399 --> 03:03:51,990
to increase the rate of flux through the
whole system and you're going to

10776
03:03:51,990 --> 03:03:52,000
whole system and you're going to
 

10777
03:03:52,000 --> 03:03:53,510
whole system and you're going to
effectively steepen the driving force to

10778
03:03:53,510 --> 03:03:53,520
effectively steepen the driving force to
 

10779
03:03:53,520 --> 03:03:55,349
effectively steepen the driving force to
make more nucleotides

10780
03:03:55,349 --> 03:03:55,359
make more nucleotides
 

10781
03:03:55,359 --> 03:03:56,630
make more nucleotides
um

10782
03:03:56,630 --> 03:03:56,640
um
 

10783
03:03:56,640 --> 03:03:59,590
um
and this can be inherited because

10784
03:03:59,590 --> 03:03:59,600
and this can be inherited because
 

10785
03:03:59,600 --> 03:04:01,830
and this can be inherited because
there are forms of membrane heredity

10786
03:04:01,830 --> 03:04:01,840
there are forms of membrane heredity
 

10787
03:04:01,840 --> 03:04:04,070
there are forms of membrane heredity
that you can have and there are

10788
03:04:04,070 --> 03:04:04,080
that you can have and there are
 

10789
03:04:04,080 --> 03:04:06,070
that you can have and there are
effectively you can if a cell divides in

10790
03:04:06,070 --> 03:04:06,080
effectively you can if a cell divides in
 

10791
03:04:06,080 --> 03:04:08,070
effectively you can if a cell divides in
two and it's got a lot of stuff inside

10792
03:04:08,070 --> 03:04:08,080
two and it's got a lot of stuff inside
 

10793
03:04:08,080 --> 03:04:10,309
two and it's got a lot of stuff inside
it and that stuff is basically bound as

10794
03:04:10,309 --> 03:04:10,319
it and that stuff is basically bound as
 

10795
03:04:10,319 --> 03:04:11,030
it and that stuff is basically bound as
a

10796
03:04:11,030 --> 03:04:11,040
a
 

10797
03:04:11,040 --> 03:04:12,870
a
network which is capable of regenerating

10798
03:04:12,870 --> 03:04:12,880
network which is capable of regenerating
 

10799
03:04:12,880 --> 03:04:14,309
network which is capable of regenerating
itself

10800
03:04:14,309 --> 03:04:14,319
itself
 

10801
03:04:14,319 --> 03:04:15,429
itself
then it will

10802
03:04:15,429 --> 03:04:15,439
then it will
 

10803
03:04:15,439 --> 03:04:17,990
then it will
inevitably regenerate itself and so you

10804
03:04:17,990 --> 03:04:18,000
inevitably regenerate itself and so you
 

10805
03:04:18,000 --> 03:04:21,030
inevitably regenerate itself and so you
can develop greater complexity

10806
03:04:21,030 --> 03:04:21,040
can develop greater complexity
 

10807
03:04:21,040 --> 03:04:23,429
can develop greater complexity
but everything that i've said depends on

10808
03:04:23,429 --> 03:04:23,439
but everything that i've said depends on
 

10809
03:04:23,439 --> 03:04:25,510
but everything that i've said depends on
the underlying rules of thermodynamics

10810
03:04:25,510 --> 03:04:25,520
the underlying rules of thermodynamics
 

10811
03:04:25,520 --> 03:04:27,990
the underlying rules of thermodynamics
there is no evolvability about that it's

10812
03:04:27,990 --> 03:04:28,000
there is no evolvability about that it's
 

10813
03:04:28,000 --> 03:04:30,550
there is no evolvability about that it's
simply an inevitable

10814
03:04:30,550 --> 03:04:30,560
simply an inevitable

simply an inevitable
outcome of your starting point

10816
03:04:32,870 --> 03:04:32,880
outcome of your starting point
 

10817
03:04:32,880 --> 03:04:34,870
outcome of your starting point
assuming that you're able to

10818
03:04:34,870 --> 03:04:34,880
assuming that you're able to
 

10819
03:04:34,880 --> 03:04:36,550
assuming that you're able to
increase the driving force through the

10820
03:04:36,550 --> 03:04:36,560
increase the driving force through the
 

10821
03:04:36,560 --> 03:04:38,389
increase the driving force through the
system you will generate more of the

10822
03:04:38,389 --> 03:04:38,399
system you will generate more of the
 

10823
03:04:38,399 --> 03:04:39,990
system you will generate more of the
same you'll expand on what you can do

10824
03:04:39,990 --> 03:04:40,000
same you'll expand on what you can do
 

10825
03:04:40,000 --> 03:04:41,830
same you'll expand on what you can do
but you'll never get anything different

10826
03:04:41,830 --> 03:04:41,840
but you'll never get anything different
 

10827
03:04:41,840 --> 03:04:43,429
but you'll never get anything different
than that and it's only when you

10828
03:04:43,429 --> 03:04:43,439
than that and it's only when you
 

10829
03:04:43,439 --> 03:04:44,870
than that and it's only when you
introduce

10830
03:04:44,870 --> 03:04:44,880
introduce
 

10831
03:04:44,880 --> 03:04:47,510
introduce
information into that as a gene as a as

10832
03:04:47,510 --> 03:04:47,520
information into that as a gene as a as
 

10833
03:04:47,520 --> 03:04:48,950
information into that as a gene as a as
a kind of

10834
03:04:48,950 --> 03:04:48,960
a kind of
 

10835
03:04:48,960 --> 03:04:51,750
a kind of
small stretch of rna

10836
03:04:51,750 --> 03:04:51,760
small stretch of rna
 

10837
03:04:51,760 --> 03:04:53,670
small stretch of rna
which can be random stretch

10838
03:04:53,670 --> 03:04:53,680
which can be random stretch
 

10839
03:04:53,680 --> 03:04:55,750
which can be random stretch
then you get real evolvability then you

10840
03:04:55,750 --> 03:04:55,760
then you get real evolvability then you
 

10841
03:04:55,760 --> 03:04:57,830
then you get real evolvability then you
get biology as we know it but you also

10842
03:04:57,830 --> 03:04:57,840
get biology as we know it but you also
 

10843
03:04:57,840 --> 03:05:00,389
get biology as we know it but you also
have selection as we know it

10844
03:05:00,389 --> 03:05:00,399
have selection as we know it
 

10845
03:05:00,399 --> 03:05:02,469
have selection as we know it
yeah i mean i don't know how to think

10846
03:05:02,469 --> 03:05:02,479
yeah i mean i don't know how to think
 

10847
03:05:02,479 --> 03:05:05,349
yeah i mean i don't know how to think
about information

10848
03:05:05,349 --> 03:05:05,359
about information
 

10849
03:05:05,359 --> 03:05:07,429
about information
um that's the kind of memory of the

10850
03:05:07,429 --> 03:05:07,439
um that's the kind of memory of the
 

10851
03:05:07,439 --> 03:05:09,349
um that's the kind of memory of the
systems it's not

10852
03:05:09,349 --> 03:05:09,359
systems it's not
 

10853
03:05:09,359 --> 03:05:11,510
systems it's not
yet at the local level it's propagation

10854
03:05:11,510 --> 03:05:11,520
yet at the local level it's propagation
 

10855
03:05:11,520 --> 03:05:14,070
yet at the local level it's propagation
of copying yourself and changing and

03:05:14,070 --> 03:05:14,080
of copying yourself and changing and
 

10857
03:05:14,080 --> 03:05:15,750
of copying yourself and changing and
improving your adaptability to the

10858
03:05:15,750 --> 03:05:15,760
improving your adaptability to the

environment
 

10861
03:05:17,439 --> 03:05:19,990
environment
but if you look at earth

10862
03:05:19,990 --> 03:05:20,000
but if you look at earth
 

10863
03:05:20,000 --> 03:05:21,269
but if you look at earth
as a whole

it has a kind of memory that's the key

10866
03:05:23,590 --> 03:05:23,600
it has a kind of memory that's the key

it remembers the stuff it tries
 

10873
03:05:30,479 --> 03:05:33,670
it remembers the stuff it tries
like if you were to describe earth

10874
03:05:33,670 --> 03:05:33,680
like if you were to describe earth
 

10875
03:05:33,680 --> 03:05:36,150
like if you were to describe earth
i i think evolution is something that we

10876
03:05:36,150 --> 03:05:36,160
i i think evolution is something that we
 

10877
03:05:36,160 --> 03:05:38,870
i i think evolution is something that we
experience

experience
uh as individual organisms

03:05:41,600 --> 03:05:43,269
uh as individual organisms
that's that's how the individual

10882
03:05:43,269 --> 03:05:43,279
that's that's how the individual
 

10883
03:05:43,279 --> 03:05:45,110
that's that's how the individual
organisms interact with each other

03:05:45,110 --> 03:05:45,120
organisms interact with each other
 

10885
03:05:45,120 --> 03:05:47,590
organisms interact with each other
there's a natural selection

10886
03:05:47,590 --> 03:05:47,600
there's a natural selection
 

10887
03:05:47,600 --> 03:05:48,870
there's a natural selection
but when you look at earth as an

um
 

10895
03:05:53,920 --> 03:05:56,150
um
how would you describe it i mean well

10896
03:05:56,150 --> 03:05:56,160
how would you describe it i mean well
 

10897
03:05:56,160 --> 03:05:57,910
how would you describe it i mean well
not as an organism

10898

not as an organism
i mean the idea of gaia is is lovely

10900
03:06:00,870 --> 03:06:00,880
i mean the idea of gaia is is lovely
 

10901
03:06:00,880 --> 03:06:03,750
i mean the idea of gaia is is lovely
and james lovelock originally put gaia

10902
03:06:03,750 --> 03:06:03,760
and james lovelock originally put gaia
 

10903
03:06:03,760 --> 03:06:06,230
and james lovelock originally put gaia
out as a as an organism that had somehow

10904

out as a as an organism that had somehow
 

10905
03:06:06,240 --> 03:06:08,469
out as a as an organism that had somehow
evolved uh and he was immediately

10906
03:06:08,469 --> 03:06:08,479
evolved uh and he was immediately
 

10907
03:06:08,479 --> 03:06:10,469
evolved uh and he was immediately
attacked by lots of people

10908

03:06:13,590 --> 03:06:13,600
and he's not wrong but he backpedaled
 

10911
03:06:13,600 --> 03:06:15,510
and he's not wrong but he backpedaled
somewhat because that was more of a

somewhat because that was more of a

the science is now called earth systems

the science is now called earth systems
 

10919
03:06:22,479 --> 03:06:24,389
the science is now called earth systems
science and it's really about how does

10920
03:06:24,389 --> 03:06:24,399
science and it's really about how does
 

10921
03:06:24,399 --> 03:06:26,790
science and it's really about how does
the the world kind of regulate itself so

10922
03:06:26,790 --> 03:06:26,800
the the world kind of regulate itself so
 

10923
03:06:26,800 --> 03:06:28,230
the the world kind of regulate itself so
it remains within the limits which are

10924
03:06:28,230 --> 03:06:28,240
it remains within the limits which are
 

10925
03:06:28,240 --> 03:06:29,670
it remains within the limits which are
hospitable to life and it does it

10926
03:06:29,670 --> 03:06:29,680
hospitable to life and it does it
 

10927
03:06:29,680 --> 03:06:31,830
hospitable to life and it does it
amazingly well and it is it is working

10928
03:06:31,830 --> 03:06:31,840
amazingly well and it is it is working
 

10929
03:06:31,840 --> 03:06:33,429
amazingly well and it is it is working
at a planetary level

10930
03:06:33,429 --> 03:06:33,439
at a planetary level
 

10931
03:06:33,439 --> 03:06:34,309

but it's not evolving by natural
 

10939
03:06:40,640 --> 03:06:42,150
but it's not evolving by natural
selection and it can't because there's

10940
03:06:42,150 --> 03:06:42,160
selection and it can't because there's
 

10941
03:06:42,160 --> 03:06:44,870

only one of it um and so it can change

10942
03:06:44,870 --> 03:06:44,880
only one of it um and so it can change
 

10943
03:06:44,880 --> 03:06:47,110
only one of it um and so it can change
over time but it's not evolving all the

yeah but it's a self-sustaining organism

10950

would they what would they notice

10972
03:07:20,389 --> 03:07:20,399
would they what would they notice
 

10973
03:07:20,399 --> 03:07:22,230
would they what would they notice
what would be the basic unit of life

10974
03:07:22,230 --> 03:07:22,240
what would be the basic unit of life
 

10975
03:07:22,240 --> 03:07:25,190
what would be the basic unit of life
they would notice trees probably i mean

10976
03:07:25,190 --> 03:07:25,200
they would notice trees probably i mean
 

10977
03:07:25,200 --> 03:07:27,349
they would notice trees probably i mean
it's green it's green and blue i think

10978
03:07:27,349 --> 03:07:27,359
it's green it's green and blue i think
 

10979
03:07:27,359 --> 03:07:28,790
it's green it's green and blue i think
that's the first thing you'd notice is

10980
03:07:28,790 --> 03:07:28,800
that's the first thing you'd notice is
 

10981
03:07:28,800 --> 03:07:30,870
that's the first thing you'd notice is
it stands out from space as being

10982
03:07:30,870 --> 03:07:30,880
it stands out from space as being
 

10983
03:07:30,880 --> 03:07:32,870
it stands out from space as being
different to any of the other planets

they would notice the trees at first

10986
03:07:35,510 --> 03:07:35,520
they would notice the trees at first
 

10987
03:07:35,520 --> 03:07:37,349
they would notice the trees at first
because the ground i would i noticed the

10988
03:07:37,349 --> 03:07:37,359
because the ground i would i noticed the
 

10989
03:07:37,359 --> 03:07:38,870
because the ground i would i noticed the
green yes yeah

10990
03:07:38,870 --> 03:07:38,880
green yes yeah
 

10991
03:07:38,880 --> 03:07:41,030
green yes yeah
and then uh probably notice

10992
03:07:41,030 --> 03:07:41,040
and then uh probably notice
 

10993
03:07:41,040 --> 03:07:42,950
and then uh probably notice
figure out the photosynthesis and then

10994
03:07:42,950 --> 03:07:42,960
figure out the photosynthesis and then
 

10995
03:07:42,960 --> 03:07:46,070
figure out the photosynthesis and then
you notice cities second i suspect

10996
03:07:46,070 --> 03:07:46,080
you notice cities second i suspect
 

10997
03:07:46,080 --> 03:07:47,349
you notice cities second i suspect
first

10998

11068
03:09:05,349 --> 03:09:05,359
are in some sense living there's a
 

11069
03:09:05,359 --> 03:09:07,750
are in some sense living there's a
controlled flow of energy there must be

11070
03:09:07,750 --> 03:09:07,760
controlled flow of energy there must be
 

11071
03:09:07,760 --> 03:09:10,389
controlled flow of energy there must be
information and some form of metabolism

11072
03:09:10,389 --> 03:09:10,399
information and some form of metabolism
 

11073
03:09:10,399 --> 03:09:12,950
information and some form of metabolism
some turnover of materials are they

11074
03:09:12,950 --> 03:09:12,960
some turnover of materials are they
 

11075
03:09:12,960 --> 03:09:13,990
some turnover of materials are they
alive

11076
03:09:13,990 --> 03:09:14,000
alive
 

11077
03:09:14,000 --> 03:09:18,150
alive
no of course not they are cities

11078
03:09:18,150 --> 03:09:18,160
no of course not they are cities
 

11079
03:09:18,160 --> 03:09:20,150
no of course not they are cities
so is there some sense that cities are

11080
03:09:20,150 --> 03:09:20,160
so is there some sense that cities are
 

11081
03:09:20,160 --> 03:09:21,830
so is there some sense that cities are
living beings

11082
03:09:21,830 --> 03:09:21,840
living beings
 

11083
03:09:21,840 --> 03:09:23,670
living beings
you think aliens would think of them as

11084
03:09:23,670 --> 03:09:23,680
you think aliens would think of them as
 

11085
03:09:23,680 --> 03:09:25,990
you think aliens would think of them as
living beings well it would be easy to

11086
03:09:25,990 --> 03:09:26,000
living beings well it would be easy to
 

11087
03:09:26,000 --> 03:09:27,830
living beings well it would be easy to
see it that way wouldn't it

11088
03:09:27,830 --> 03:09:27,840
see it that way wouldn't it
 

11089
03:09:27,840 --> 03:09:29,510
see it that way wouldn't it
um

11090
03:09:29,510 --> 03:09:29,520
um
 

11091
03:09:29,520 --> 03:09:33,030
um
it uh wakes up at night they wake up

11092
03:09:33,030 --> 03:09:33,040
it uh wakes up at night they wake up
 

11093
03:09:33,040 --> 03:09:35,269
it uh wakes up at night they wake up
it's strictly nocturnal

11094
03:09:35,269 --> 03:09:35,279
it's strictly nocturnal
 

11095
03:09:35,279 --> 03:09:36,070
it's strictly nocturnal
yes

11096
03:09:36,070 --> 03:09:36,080
yes
 

11097
03:09:36,080 --> 03:09:38,150
yes
i imagine that any aliens that are smart

11098
03:09:38,150 --> 03:09:38,160
i imagine that any aliens that are smart
 

11099
03:09:38,160 --> 03:09:40,150
i imagine that any aliens that are smart
enough to get here would understand that

11100
03:09:40,150 --> 03:09:40,160
enough to get here would understand that
 

11101
03:09:40,160 --> 03:09:43,510
enough to get here would understand that
uh they're they're not living beings

11102
03:09:43,510 --> 03:09:43,520
uh they're they're not living beings
 

11103
03:09:43,520 --> 03:09:45,429
uh they're they're not living beings
my reason for

11104
03:09:45,429 --> 03:09:45,439
my reason for
 

11105
03:09:45,439 --> 03:09:47,590
my reason for
saying that is that

11106
03:09:47,590 --> 03:09:47,600
saying that is that
 

11107
03:09:47,600 --> 03:09:48,950
saying that is that
we

11108
03:09:48,950 --> 03:09:48,960
we
 

11109
03:09:48,960 --> 03:09:50,710
we
tend to think of

11110
03:09:50,710 --> 03:09:50,720
tend to think of
 

11111
03:09:50,720 --> 03:09:52,550
tend to think of
biology in terms of information and

11112
03:09:52,550 --> 03:09:52,560
biology in terms of information and
 

11113
03:09:52,560 --> 03:09:54,630
biology in terms of information and
forget about cells

11114
03:09:54,630 --> 03:09:54,640
forget about cells
 

11115
03:09:54,640 --> 03:09:56,389
forget about cells
and i was trying to draw a comparison

11116
03:09:56,389 --> 03:09:56,399
and i was trying to draw a comparison
 

11117
03:09:56,399 --> 03:09:58,550
and i was trying to draw a comparison
between the cell as a city and and the

11118
03:09:58,550 --> 03:09:58,560
between the cell as a city and and the
 

11119
03:09:58,560 --> 03:10:00,389
between the cell as a city and and the
energy flow through the city and the

11120
03:10:00,389 --> 03:10:00,399
energy flow through the city and the
 

11121
03:10:00,399 --> 03:10:02,309
energy flow through the city and the
energy flow through cells and the

11122
03:10:02,309 --> 03:10:02,319
energy flow through cells and the
 

11123
03:10:02,319 --> 03:10:03,990
energy flow through cells and the
turnover of materials

11124
03:10:03,990 --> 03:10:04,000
turnover of materials
 

11125
03:10:04,000 --> 03:10:06,389
turnover of materials
and an interesting thing about cities

11126
03:10:06,389 --> 03:10:06,399
and an interesting thing about cities
 

11127
03:10:06,399 --> 03:10:08,389
and an interesting thing about cities
is that they're not really

11128
03:10:08,389 --> 03:10:08,399
is that they're not really
 

11129
03:10:08,399 --> 03:10:10,870
is that they're not really
exactly governed by anybody

11130
03:10:10,870 --> 03:10:10,880
exactly governed by anybody
 

11131
03:10:10,880 --> 03:10:13,269
exactly governed by anybody
um there are

11132
03:10:13,269 --> 03:10:13,279
um there are
 

11133
03:10:13,279 --> 03:10:14,950
um there are
regulations and systems and whatever

11134
03:10:14,950 --> 03:10:14,960
regulations and systems and whatever
 

11135
03:10:14,960 --> 03:10:17,670
regulations and systems and whatever
else but it's pretty loose

11136
03:10:17,670 --> 03:10:17,680
else but it's pretty loose
 

11137
03:10:17,680 --> 03:10:19,269
else but it's pretty loose
um

11138
03:10:19,269 --> 03:10:19,279
um
 

11139
03:10:19,279 --> 03:10:21,190
um
they have their own life their own way

11140
03:10:21,190 --> 03:10:21,200
they have their own life their own way
 

11141
03:10:21,200 --> 03:10:24,389
they have their own life their own way
of developing over time they they

11142
03:10:24,389 --> 03:10:24,399
of developing over time they they
 

11143
03:10:24,399 --> 03:10:25,349
of developing over time they they
and in that sense they're quite

11144
03:10:25,349 --> 03:10:25,359
and in that sense they're quite
 

11145
03:10:25,359 --> 03:10:26,469
and in that sense they're quite
biological

11146
03:10:26,469 --> 03:10:26,479
biological
 

11147
03:10:26,479 --> 03:10:28,150
biological
they're not it's there was there was a

11148
03:10:28,150 --> 03:10:28,160
they're not it's there was there was a
 

11149
03:10:28,160 --> 03:10:29,030
they're not it's there was there was a
plan

11150
03:10:29,030 --> 03:10:29,040
plan
 

11151
03:10:29,040 --> 03:10:30,870
plan
after the great fire of london

11152
03:10:30,870 --> 03:10:30,880
after the great fire of london
 

11153
03:10:30,880 --> 03:10:33,429
after the great fire of london
christopher wren was uh was making plans

11154
03:10:33,429 --> 03:10:33,439
christopher wren was uh was making plans
 

11155
03:10:33,439 --> 03:10:35,830
christopher wren was uh was making plans
not only for saint paul's cathedral but

11156
03:10:35,830 --> 03:10:35,840
not only for saint paul's cathedral but
 

11157
03:10:35,840 --> 03:10:38,630
not only for saint paul's cathedral but
also to rebuild in in large parisian

11158
03:10:38,630 --> 03:10:38,640
also to rebuild in in large parisian
 

11159
03:10:38,640 --> 03:10:40,870
also to rebuild in in large parisian
type boulevards a large part of the area

11160
03:10:40,870 --> 03:10:40,880
type boulevards a large part of the area
 

11161
03:10:40,880 --> 03:10:43,269
type boulevards a large part of the area
of central london that was uh was was

11162
03:10:43,269 --> 03:10:43,279
of central london that was uh was was
 

11163
03:10:43,279 --> 03:10:44,630
of central london that was uh was was
was burned

11164
03:10:44,630 --> 03:10:44,640
was burned
 

11165
03:10:44,640 --> 03:10:46,309
was burned
and it never happened

11166
03:10:46,309 --> 03:10:46,319
and it never happened
 

11167
03:10:46,319 --> 03:10:47,590
and it never happened
because they didn't have enough money i

11168
03:10:47,590 --> 03:10:47,600
because they didn't have enough money i
 

11169
03:10:47,600 --> 03:10:49,349
because they didn't have enough money i
think but it's interesting what was in

11170
03:10:49,349 --> 03:10:49,359
think but it's interesting what was in
 

11171
03:10:49,359 --> 03:10:51,670
think but it's interesting what was in
the plan were all these boulevards um

11172
03:10:51,670 --> 03:10:51,680
the plan were all these boulevards um
 

11173
03:10:51,680 --> 03:10:54,870
the plan were all these boulevards um
but there were no pubs and no coffee

11174
03:10:54,870 --> 03:10:54,880
but there were no pubs and no coffee
 

11175
03:10:54,880 --> 03:10:57,030
but there were no pubs and no coffee
houses or anything like that

11176
03:10:57,030 --> 03:10:57,040
houses or anything like that
 

11177
03:10:57,040 --> 03:10:59,590
houses or anything like that
and the reality was london just kind of

11178
03:10:59,590 --> 03:10:59,600
and the reality was london just kind of
 

11179
03:10:59,600 --> 03:11:01,190
and the reality was london just kind of
grew up in a

11180
03:11:01,190 --> 03:11:01,200
grew up in a
 

11181
03:11:01,200 --> 03:11:03,429
grew up in a
set of jumbled streets and it was the

11182
03:11:03,429 --> 03:11:03,439
set of jumbled streets and it was the
 

11183
03:11:03,439 --> 03:11:04,870
set of jumbled streets and it was the
coffee houses and the pubs where all the

11184
03:11:04,870 --> 03:11:04,880
coffee houses and the pubs where all the
 

11185
03:11:04,880 --> 03:11:06,630
coffee houses and the pubs where all the
business of the city of london was being

11186
03:11:06,630 --> 03:11:06,640
business of the city of london was being
 

11187
03:11:06,640 --> 03:11:08,389
business of the city of london was being
done and that was where the real life of

11188
03:11:08,389 --> 03:11:08,399
done and that was where the real life of
 

11189
03:11:08,399 --> 03:11:09,910
done and that was where the real life of
the city was and no one had planned it

11190
03:11:09,910 --> 03:11:09,920
the city was and no one had planned it
 

11191
03:11:09,920 --> 03:11:12,309
the city was and no one had planned it
the whole thing was unplanned and works

11192
03:11:12,309 --> 03:11:12,319
the whole thing was unplanned and works
 

11193
03:11:12,319 --> 03:11:14,309
the whole thing was unplanned and works
much better that way and in that sense

11194
03:11:14,309 --> 03:11:14,319
much better that way and in that sense
 

11195
03:11:14,319 --> 03:11:15,830
much better that way and in that sense
the cell is completely unplanned it's

11196
03:11:15,830 --> 03:11:15,840
the cell is completely unplanned it's
 

11197
03:11:15,840 --> 03:11:17,349
the cell is completely unplanned it's
not controlled by the genes in the

11198
03:11:17,349 --> 03:11:17,359
not controlled by the genes in the
 

11199
03:11:17,359 --> 03:11:18,790
not controlled by the genes in the
nucleus in the way that we might like to

11200
03:11:18,790 --> 03:11:18,800
nucleus in the way that we might like to
 

11201
03:11:18,800 --> 03:11:21,269
nucleus in the way that we might like to
think that it is but it's it's kind of

11202
03:11:21,269 --> 03:11:21,279
think that it is but it's it's kind of
 

11203
03:11:21,279 --> 03:11:23,510
think that it is but it's it's kind of
evolved entity that uh has the same kind

11204
03:11:23,510 --> 03:11:23,520
evolved entity that uh has the same kind
 

11205
03:11:23,520 --> 03:11:25,590
evolved entity that uh has the same kind
of flux the same animation the same life

11206
03:11:25,590 --> 03:11:25,600
of flux the same animation the same life
 

11207
03:11:25,600 --> 03:11:27,190
of flux the same animation the same life
so i think it's it's a it's a beautiful

11208
03:11:27,190 --> 03:11:27,200
so i think it's it's a it's a beautiful
 

11209
03:11:27,200 --> 03:11:28,309
so i think it's it's a it's a beautiful
analogy

11210
03:11:28,309 --> 03:11:28,319
analogy
 

11211
03:11:28,319 --> 03:11:29,670
analogy
but i wouldn't get

11212
03:11:29,670 --> 03:11:29,680
but i wouldn't get
 

11213
03:11:29,680 --> 03:11:31,910
but i wouldn't get
too stuck with it as a as a matter of

11214
03:11:31,910 --> 03:11:31,920
too stuck with it as a as a matter of
 

11215
03:11:31,920 --> 03:11:34,070
too stuck with it as a as a matter of
fact see i disagree with you i i i

11216
03:11:34,070 --> 03:11:34,080
fact see i disagree with you i i i
 

11217
03:11:34,080 --> 03:11:36,630
fact see i disagree with you i i i
disagree with you i i think you're

11218
03:11:36,630 --> 03:11:36,640
disagree with you i i think you're
 

11219
03:11:36,640 --> 03:11:38,870
disagree with you i i think you're
you are so steeped

11220
03:11:38,870 --> 03:11:38,880
you are so steeped
 

11221
03:11:38,880 --> 03:11:41,429
you are so steeped
and actually the entirety of

11222
03:11:41,429 --> 03:11:41,439
and actually the entirety of
 

11223
03:11:41,439 --> 03:11:43,269
and actually the entirety of
science

11224
03:11:43,269 --> 03:11:43,279
science
 

11225
03:11:43,279 --> 03:11:45,429
science
the history of science is steeped

11226
03:11:45,429 --> 03:11:45,439
the history of science is steeped
 

11227
03:11:45,439 --> 03:11:48,150
the history of science is steeped
in a biological framework of thinking

11228
03:11:48,150 --> 03:11:48,160
in a biological framework of thinking
 

11229
03:11:48,160 --> 03:11:50,630
in a biological framework of thinking
about what is life and not just

11230
03:11:50,630 --> 03:11:50,640
about what is life and not just
 

11231
03:11:50,640 --> 03:11:53,990
about what is life and not just
biological is very human-centric too

11232
03:11:53,990 --> 03:11:54,000
biological is very human-centric too
 

11233
03:11:54,000 --> 03:11:55,590
biological is very human-centric too
that human

11234
03:11:55,590 --> 03:11:55,600
that human
 

11235
03:11:55,600 --> 03:11:57,830
that human
the human organism is the epitome of

11236
03:11:57,830 --> 03:11:57,840
the human organism is the epitome of
 

11237
03:11:57,840 --> 03:12:00,150
the human organism is the epitome of
life

11238
03:12:00,150 --> 03:12:00,160

 

11239
03:12:00,160 --> 03:12:02,309

on earth i don't i don't know i i think

11240
03:12:02,309 --> 03:12:02,319
on earth i don't i don't know i i think
 

11241
03:12:02,319 --> 03:12:04,070
on earth i don't i don't know i i think
there is some deep fundamental way in

11242
03:12:04,070 --> 03:12:04,080
there is some deep fundamental way in
 

11243
03:12:04,080 --> 03:12:07,110
there is some deep fundamental way in
which a city is a living being

11244
03:12:07,110 --> 03:12:07,120
which a city is a living being
 

11245
03:12:07,120 --> 03:12:08,550
which a city is a living being
in the same way that

11246
03:12:08,550 --> 03:12:08,560
in the same way that
 

11247
03:12:08,560 --> 03:12:09,910
in the same way that
huma

11248
03:12:09,910 --> 03:12:09,920
huma
 

11249
03:12:09,920 --> 03:12:11,750
huma
it doesn't give rise to an offspring

11250
03:12:11,750 --> 03:12:11,760
it doesn't give rise to an offspring
 

11251
03:12:11,760 --> 03:12:12,870
it doesn't give rise to an offspring
city

11252
03:12:12,870 --> 03:12:12,880
city
 

11253
03:12:12,880 --> 03:12:14,630
city
it's so i mean it's not it doesn't work

11254
03:12:14,630 --> 03:12:14,640
it's so i mean it's not it doesn't work
 

11255
03:12:14,640 --> 03:12:16,950
it's so i mean it's not it doesn't work
by natural selection it works by if

11256
03:12:16,950 --> 03:12:16,960
by natural selection it works by if
 

11257
03:12:16,960 --> 03:12:18,950
by natural selection it works by if
anything means it works by

11258
03:12:18,950 --> 03:12:18,960
anything means it works by
 

11259
03:12:18,960 --> 03:12:20,710
anything means it works by
um yeah but isn't it

11260
03:12:20,710 --> 03:12:20,720
um yeah but isn't it
 

11261
03:12:20,720 --> 03:12:22,870
um yeah but isn't it
itself conceptually as a

11262
03:12:22,870 --> 03:12:22,880
itself conceptually as a
 

11263
03:12:22,880 --> 03:12:24,469
itself conceptually as a
mode of being

11264
03:12:24,469 --> 03:12:24,479
mode of being
 

11265
03:12:24,479 --> 03:12:28,630
mode of being
so i mean maybe memes maybe ideas are

11266
03:12:28,630 --> 03:12:28,640
so i mean maybe memes maybe ideas are
 

11267
03:12:28,640 --> 03:12:30,150
so i mean maybe memes maybe ideas are
are the organisms that are really

11268
03:12:30,150 --> 03:12:30,160
are the organisms that are really
 

11269
03:12:30,160 --> 03:12:33,269
are the organisms that are really
essential to life on earth maybe it's

11270
03:12:33,269 --> 03:12:33,279
essential to life on earth maybe it's
 

11271
03:12:33,279 --> 03:12:35,190
essential to life on earth maybe it's
much more important about the collective

11272
03:12:35,190 --> 03:12:35,200
much more important about the collective
 

11273
03:12:35,200 --> 03:12:37,429
much more important about the collective
aspect of human nature the collective

11274
03:12:37,429 --> 03:12:37,439
aspect of human nature the collective
 

11275
03:12:37,439 --> 03:12:38,870
aspect of human nature the collective
intelligence than the individual

11276
03:12:38,870 --> 03:12:38,880
intelligence than the individual
 

11277
03:12:38,880 --> 03:12:40,950
intelligence than the individual
intelligence maybe

11278
03:12:40,950 --> 03:12:40,960
intelligence maybe
 

11279
03:12:40,960 --> 03:12:43,670
intelligence maybe
the collective humanity is the organism

11280
03:12:43,670 --> 03:12:43,680
the collective humanity is the organism
 

11281
03:12:43,680 --> 03:12:46,950
the collective humanity is the organism
and the the thing that that defines the

11282
03:12:46,950 --> 03:12:46,960
and the the thing that that defines the
 

11283
03:12:46,960 --> 03:12:49,030
and the the thing that that defines the
collective intelligence of humanity is

11284
03:12:49,030 --> 03:12:49,040
collective intelligence of humanity is
 

11285
03:12:49,040 --> 03:12:50,630
collective intelligence of humanity is
the ideas

11286
03:12:50,630 --> 03:12:50,640
the ideas
 

11287
03:12:50,640 --> 03:12:52,790
the ideas
and maybe the way that manifests itself

11288
03:12:52,790 --> 03:12:52,800
and maybe the way that manifests itself
 

11289
03:12:52,800 --> 03:12:54,150
and maybe the way that manifests itself
is cities

11290
03:12:54,150 --> 03:12:54,160
is cities
 

11291
03:12:54,160 --> 03:12:56,870
is cities
maybe uh or societies or geographically

11292
03:12:56,870 --> 03:12:56,880
maybe uh or societies or geographically
 

11293
03:12:56,880 --> 03:12:58,710
maybe uh or societies or geographically
constrained societies or nations and all

11294
03:12:58,710 --> 03:12:58,720
constrained societies or nations and all
 

11295
03:12:58,720 --> 03:13:01,110
constrained societies or nations and all
that kind of stuff i mean from an alien

11296
03:13:01,110 --> 03:13:01,120
that kind of stuff i mean from an alien
 

11297
03:13:01,120 --> 03:13:03,429
that kind of stuff i mean from an alien
perspective it's possible that that is

11298
03:13:03,429 --> 03:13:03,439
perspective it's possible that that is
 

11299
03:13:03,439 --> 03:13:04,790
perspective it's possible that that is
the more

11300
03:13:04,790 --> 03:13:04,800
the more
 

11301
03:13:04,800 --> 03:13:07,670
the more
deeply noticeable thing not from a place

11302
03:13:07,670 --> 03:13:07,680
deeply noticeable thing not from a place
 

11303
03:13:07,680 --> 03:13:09,830
deeply noticeable thing not from a place
of but what's noticeable doesn't tell

11304
03:13:09,830 --> 03:13:09,840
of but what's noticeable doesn't tell
 

11305
03:13:09,840 --> 03:13:12,150
of but what's noticeable doesn't tell
you how it works

11306
03:13:12,150 --> 03:13:12,160
you how it works
 

11307
03:13:12,160 --> 03:13:13,670
you how it works
i i think i mean i don't have any

11308
03:13:13,670 --> 03:13:13,680
i i think i mean i don't have any
 

11309
03:13:13,680 --> 03:13:15,110
i i think i mean i don't have any
problem with what you're saying really

11310
03:13:15,110 --> 03:13:15,120
problem with what you're saying really
 

11311
03:13:15,120 --> 03:13:16,630
problem with what you're saying really
except that

11312
03:13:16,630 --> 03:13:16,640
except that
 

11313
03:13:16,640 --> 03:13:18,469
except that
it's not possible

11314
03:13:18,469 --> 03:13:18,479
it's not possible
 

11315
03:13:18,479 --> 03:13:21,590
it's not possible
without the humans you know we we went

11316
03:13:21,590 --> 03:13:21,600
without the humans you know we we went
 

11317
03:13:21,600 --> 03:13:24,710
without the humans you know we we went
from a hunter-gatherer's type

11318
03:13:24,710 --> 03:13:24,720
from a hunter-gatherer's type
 

11319
03:13:24,720 --> 03:13:26,870
from a hunter-gatherer's type
economy if you like without cities

11320
03:13:26,870 --> 03:13:26,880
economy if you like without cities
 

11321
03:13:26,880 --> 03:13:28,870
economy if you like without cities
through to cities and as soon as we get

11322
03:13:28,870 --> 03:13:28,880
through to cities and as soon as we get
 

11323
03:13:28,880 --> 03:13:31,190
through to cities and as soon as we get
into human evolution and culture and

11324
03:13:31,190 --> 03:13:31,200
into human evolution and culture and
 

11325
03:13:31,200 --> 03:13:33,990
into human evolution and culture and
society and so on then then then yes

11326
03:13:33,990 --> 03:13:34,000
society and so on then then then yes
 

11327
03:13:34,000 --> 03:13:36,229
society and so on then then then yes
there are other forms of evolution

11328
03:13:36,229 --> 03:13:36,239
there are other forms of evolution
 

11329
03:13:36,239 --> 03:13:38,150
there are other forms of evolution
uh the forms of change

11330
03:13:38,150 --> 03:13:38,160
uh the forms of change
 

11331
03:13:38,160 --> 03:13:40,630
uh the forms of change
um but but cities don't don't directly

11332
03:13:40,630 --> 03:13:40,640
um but but cities don't don't directly
 

11333
03:13:40,640 --> 03:13:42,150
um but but cities don't don't directly
propagate themselves they propagate

11334
03:13:42,150 --> 03:13:42,160
propagate themselves they propagate
 

11335
03:13:42,160 --> 03:13:43,910
propagate themselves they propagate
themselves through human societies and

11336
03:13:43,910 --> 03:13:43,920
themselves through human societies and
 

11337
03:13:43,920 --> 03:13:45,510
themselves through human societies and
human societies only exist because

11338
03:13:45,510 --> 03:13:45,520
human societies only exist because
 

11339
03:13:45,520 --> 03:13:47,110
human societies only exist because
humans as individuals propagate

11340
03:13:47,110 --> 03:13:47,120
humans as individuals propagate
 

11341
03:13:47,120 --> 03:13:48,309
humans as individuals propagate
themselves

11342
03:13:48,309 --> 03:13:48,319
themselves
 

11343
03:13:48,319 --> 03:13:49,750
themselves
so there's a kind of there is a

11344
03:13:49,750 --> 03:13:49,760
so there's a kind of there is a
 

11345
03:13:49,760 --> 03:13:52,070
so there's a kind of there is a
hierarchy there and without the humans

11346
03:13:52,070 --> 03:13:52,080
hierarchy there and without the humans
 

11347
03:13:52,080 --> 03:13:53,349
hierarchy there and without the humans
in the first place none of the rest of

11348
03:13:53,349 --> 03:13:53,359
in the first place none of the rest of
 

11349
03:13:53,359 --> 03:13:55,590
in the first place none of the rest of
it exists it says you

11350
03:13:55,590 --> 03:13:55,600
it exists it says you
 

11351
03:13:55,600 --> 03:13:58,070
it exists it says you
life is primarily defined by the the

11352
03:13:58,070 --> 03:13:58,080
life is primarily defined by the the
 

11353
03:13:58,080 --> 03:14:01,030
life is primarily defined by the the
basic unit on which evolution can

11354
03:14:01,030 --> 03:14:01,040
basic unit on which evolution can
 

11355
03:14:01,040 --> 03:14:02,710
basic unit on which evolution can
operate and that's a really unknown

11356
03:14:02,710 --> 03:14:02,720
operate and that's a really unknown
 

11357
03:14:02,720 --> 03:14:04,070
operate and that's a really unknown
thing yes

11358
03:14:04,070 --> 03:14:04,080
thing yes
 

11359
03:14:04,080 --> 03:14:05,670
thing yes
yeah

11360
03:14:05,670 --> 03:14:05,680
yeah
 

11361
03:14:05,680 --> 03:14:07,510
yeah
uh and we don't know we don't have any

11362
03:14:07,510 --> 03:14:07,520
uh and we don't know we don't have any
 

11363
03:14:07,520 --> 03:14:09,910
uh and we don't know we don't have any
other better ideas than evolution for

11364
03:14:09,910 --> 03:14:09,920
other better ideas than evolution for
 

11365
03:14:09,920 --> 03:14:11,670
other better ideas than evolution for
how to create i never came across a

11366
03:14:11,670 --> 03:14:11,680
how to create i never came across a
 

11367
03:14:11,680 --> 03:14:13,429
how to create i never came across a
better idea than evolution but i mean

11368
03:14:13,429 --> 03:14:13,439
better idea than evolution but i mean
 

11369
03:14:13,439 --> 03:14:15,190
better idea than evolution but i mean
maybe maybe i'm just ignorant and i

11370
03:14:15,190 --> 03:14:15,200
maybe maybe i'm just ignorant and i
 

11371
03:14:15,200 --> 03:14:16,790
maybe maybe i'm just ignorant and i
don't know and there's

11372
03:14:16,790 --> 03:14:16,800
don't know and there's
 

11373
03:14:16,800 --> 03:14:19,110
don't know and there's
you know you mentioned that's automator

11374
03:14:19,110 --> 03:14:19,120
you know you mentioned that's automator
 

11375
03:14:19,120 --> 03:14:20,550
you know you mentioned that's automator
and so on and

11376
03:14:20,550 --> 03:14:20,560
and so on and
 

11377
03:14:20,560 --> 03:14:22,389
and so on and
i don't think specifically about that

11378
03:14:22,389 --> 03:14:22,399
i don't think specifically about that
 

11379
03:14:22,399 --> 03:14:24,070
i don't think specifically about that
but i have thought about it in terms of

11380
03:14:24,070 --> 03:14:24,080
but i have thought about it in terms of
 

11381
03:14:24,080 --> 03:14:25,670
but i have thought about it in terms of
selective units at the origin of life

11382
03:14:25,670 --> 03:14:25,680
selective units at the origin of life
 

11383
03:14:25,680 --> 03:14:28,229
selective units at the origin of life
and the difference between evolvability

the great thing about

03:14:37,520 --> 03:14:39,750
the great thing about
about genes and about selection is it

about genes and about selection is it

yeah

11422
03:15:07,269 --> 03:15:07,279
yeah
 

11423
03:15:07,279 --> 03:15:09,190
yeah
i mean there's a deeply compelling truth

11424
03:15:09,190 --> 03:15:09,200
i mean there's a deeply compelling truth
 

11425
03:15:09,200 --> 03:15:11,590
i mean there's a deeply compelling truth
to that kind of way of looking at things

11426
03:15:11,590 --> 03:15:11,600
to that kind of way of looking at things
 

11427
03:15:11,600 --> 03:15:14,150
to that kind of way of looking at things
but i just hope that we don't miss

11428
03:15:14,150 --> 03:15:14,160
but i just hope that we don't miss
 

11429
03:15:14,160 --> 03:15:17,750
but i just hope that we don't miss
the uh giant cloud

11430
03:15:17,750 --> 03:15:17,760
the uh giant cloud
 

11431
03:15:17,760 --> 03:15:20,550
the uh giant cloud
among us i i kind of hope that i'm wrong

11432
03:15:20,550 --> 03:15:20,560
among us i i kind of hope that i'm wrong
 

11433
03:15:20,560 --> 03:15:22,469
among us i i kind of hope that i'm wrong
about a lot of this because i can't say

11434
03:15:22,469 --> 03:15:22,479
about a lot of this because i can't say
 

11435
03:15:22,479 --> 03:15:23,269
about a lot of this because i can't say
that

11436
03:15:23,269 --> 03:15:23,279
that
 

11437
03:15:23,279 --> 03:15:25,750

my world view is particularly uplifting

my world view is particularly uplifting
 

11439
03:15:25,760 --> 03:15:28,150
my world view is particularly uplifting
um but in some sense

11440
03:15:28,150 --> 03:15:28,160
um but in some sense
 

11441
03:15:28,160 --> 03:15:29,590
um but in some sense
it doesn't matter if it's uplifting or

11442
03:15:29,590 --> 03:15:29,600
it doesn't matter if it's uplifting or
 

11443
03:15:29,600 --> 03:15:31,750
it doesn't matter if it's uplifting or

uh and and i'm
 

11451
03:15:36,560 --> 03:15:39,110
uh and and i'm
i think there's beauty in that too

03:15:39,110 --> 03:15:39,120
i think there's beauty in that too
 

11453
03:15:39,120 --> 03:15:41,269
i think there's beauty in that too
there's beauty in darkness

03:15:41,269 --> 03:15:41,279
there's beauty in darkness

you write about life and death
 

11457
03:15:43,520 --> 03:15:46,550
you write about life and death
uh sort of at the biological level is

you is this a feature of life or is it a

11490
03:16:24,950 --> 03:16:24,960
you is this a feature of life or is it a
 

11491
03:16:24,960 --> 03:16:28,830
you is this a feature of life or is it a
bug

11492
03:16:28,830 --> 03:16:28,840

 

11493
03:16:28,840 --> 03:16:31,910

um i don't know i mean if it's a feature

11494
03:16:31,910 --> 03:16:31,920
um i don't know i mean if it's a feature
 

11495
03:16:31,920 --> 03:16:33,349
um i don't know i mean if it's a feature
of life then i suppose it would have to

11496
03:16:33,349 --> 03:16:33,359
of life then i suppose it would have to
 

11497
03:16:33,359 --> 03:16:35,830
of life then i suppose it would have to
be true of other organisms as well and i

11498
03:16:35,830 --> 03:16:35,840
be true of other organisms as well and i
 

11499
03:16:35,840 --> 03:16:37,670
be true of other organisms as well and i
don't know

11500
03:16:37,670 --> 03:16:37,680
don't know
 

11501
03:16:37,680 --> 03:16:39,110
don't know
we were talking about dogs earlier on

11502
03:16:39,110 --> 03:16:39,120
we were talking about dogs earlier on
 

11503
03:16:39,120 --> 03:16:40,710
we were talking about dogs earlier on
and they can certainly be

11504
03:16:40,710 --> 03:16:40,720
and they can certainly be
 

11505
03:16:40,720 --> 03:16:42,150
and they can certainly be
uh very

11506
03:16:42,150 --> 03:16:42,160
uh very
 

11507
03:16:42,160 --> 03:16:45,190
uh very
sad and upset and may mooch for days

11508
03:16:45,190 --> 03:16:45,200
sad and upset and may mooch for days
 

11509
03:16:45,200 --> 03:16:46,870
sad and upset and may mooch for days
after their owner died or something like

11510
03:16:46,870 --> 03:16:46,880
after their owner died or something like
 

11511
03:16:46,880 --> 03:16:48,870
after their owner died or something like
that so i suspect in some sense it's a

11512
03:16:48,870 --> 03:16:48,880
that so i suspect in some sense it's a
 

11513
03:16:48,880 --> 03:16:50,469
that so i suspect in some sense it's a
feature of biology

11514
03:16:50,469 --> 03:16:50,479
feature of biology
 

11515
03:16:50,479 --> 03:16:52,070
feature of biology
um

11516
03:16:52,070 --> 03:16:52,080
um
 

11517
03:16:52,080 --> 03:16:54,229
um
it's probably a feature of mortality

11518
03:16:54,229 --> 03:16:54,239
it's probably a feature of mortality
 

11519
03:16:54,239 --> 03:16:57,670
it's probably a feature of mortality
it's probably

11520
03:16:57,670 --> 03:16:57,680

 

11521
03:16:57,680 --> 03:16:59,910

but beyond all of that

11522
03:16:59,910 --> 03:16:59,920
but beyond all of that
 

11523
03:16:59,920 --> 03:17:01,030
but beyond all of that
i mean i guess there's two ways you

11524
03:17:01,030 --> 03:17:01,040
i mean i guess there's two ways you
 

11525
03:17:01,040 --> 03:17:02,309
i mean i guess there's two ways you
could come at it there's one of them

11526
03:17:02,309 --> 03:17:02,319
could come at it there's one of them
 

11527
03:17:02,319 --> 03:17:04,710
could come at it there's one of them
would be to say well

11528
03:17:04,710 --> 03:17:04,720
would be to say well
 

11529
03:17:04,720 --> 03:17:07,510
would be to say well
you can effectively do do the math and

11530
03:17:07,510 --> 03:17:07,520
you can effectively do do the math and
 

11531
03:17:07,520 --> 03:17:09,110
you can effectively do do the math and
come to the conclusion that it's all

11532
03:17:09,110 --> 03:17:09,120
come to the conclusion that it's all
 

11533
03:17:09,120 --> 03:17:11,590
come to the conclusion that it's all
pointless and there's really no point in

11534
03:17:11,590 --> 03:17:11,600
pointless and there's really no point in
 

11535
03:17:11,600 --> 03:17:13,429
pointless and there's really no point in
me being here any longer

11536
03:17:13,429 --> 03:17:13,439
me being here any longer
 

11537
03:17:13,439 --> 03:17:14,389
me being here any longer
um

11538
03:17:14,389 --> 03:17:14,399
um
 

11539
03:17:14,399 --> 03:17:16,150
um
and maybe that's true in the greater

11540
03:17:16,150 --> 03:17:16,160
and maybe that's true in the greater
 

11541
03:17:16,160 --> 03:17:17,590
and maybe that's true in the greater
scheme of things

11542
03:17:17,590 --> 03:17:17,600

03:22:44,469 --> 03:22:44,479
irritated by that you know you're going
 

11861
03:22:44,479 --> 03:22:46,150
irritated by that you know you're going
to get criticism

11862
03:22:46,150 --> 03:22:46,160
to get criticism
 

11863
03:22:46,160 --> 03:22:47,750
to get criticism
from people who are irritated by what

11864
03:22:47,750 --> 03:22:47,760
from people who are irritated by what
 

11865
03:22:47,760 --> 03:22:49,510
from people who are irritated by what
you're doing and you don't know who they

11866
03:22:49,510 --> 03:22:49,520
you're doing and you don't know who they
 

11867
03:22:49,520 --> 03:22:50,630
you're doing and you don't know who they
are or what you're going to do that's

11868
03:22:50,630 --> 03:22:50,640
are or what you're going to do that's
 

11869
03:22:50,640 --> 03:22:52,229
are or what you're going to do that's
going to irritate people and in the end

11870
03:22:52,229 --> 03:22:52,239
going to irritate people and in the end
 

11871
03:22:52,239 --> 03:22:55,190
going to irritate people and in the end
all you can do is just try and

11872
03:22:55,190 --> 03:22:55,200
all you can do is just try and
 

11873
03:22:55,200 --> 03:22:57,670
all you can do is just try and
please yourself

11874
03:22:57,670 --> 03:22:57,680
please yourself
 

11875
03:22:57,680 --> 03:23:00,389
please yourself
and that means what are these big fun

11876
03:23:00,389 --> 03:23:00,399
and that means what are these big fun
 

11877
03:23:00,399 --> 03:23:03,030
and that means what are these big fun
fascinating in big questions

11878
03:23:03,030 --> 03:23:03,040
fascinating in big questions
 

11879
03:23:03,040 --> 03:23:05,110
fascinating in big questions
and what do we know about it

11880
03:23:05,110 --> 03:23:05,120
and what do we know about it
 

11881
03:23:05,120 --> 03:23:07,590
and what do we know about it
and and can i convey that and i kind of

11882
03:23:07,590 --> 03:23:07,600
and and can i convey that and i kind of
 

11883
03:23:07,600 --> 03:23:09,830
and and can i convey that and i kind of
learned in trying to write

11884
03:23:09,830 --> 03:23:09,840
learned in trying to write
 

11885
03:23:09,840 --> 03:23:12,630
learned in trying to write
um first of all

11886
03:23:12,630 --> 03:23:12,640
um first of all
 

11887
03:23:12,640 --> 03:23:14,150
um first of all
say what we know

11888
03:23:14,150 --> 03:23:14,160
say what we know
 

11889
03:23:14,160 --> 03:23:16,070
say what we know
and i was shocked in the first couple of

11890
03:23:16,070 --> 03:23:16,080
and i was shocked in the first couple of
 

11891
03:23:16,080 --> 03:23:18,550
and i was shocked in the first couple of
books how often i came up quickly

11892
03:23:18,550 --> 03:23:18,560
books how often i came up quickly
 

11893
03:23:18,560 --> 03:23:21,429
books how often i came up quickly
against all the stuff we don't know

11894
03:23:21,429 --> 03:23:21,439
against all the stuff we don't know
 

11895
03:23:21,439 --> 03:23:23,590
against all the stuff we don't know
uh and if you're trying to

11896
03:23:23,590 --> 03:23:23,600
uh and if you're trying to
 

11897
03:23:23,600 --> 03:23:26,229
uh and if you're trying to
i've realized later on in in in

11898
03:23:26,229 --> 03:23:26,239
i've realized later on in in in
 

11899
03:23:26,239 --> 03:23:28,710
i've realized later on in in in
in supervising various physicists and

11900
03:23:28,710 --> 03:23:28,720
in supervising various physicists and
 

11901
03:23:28,720 --> 03:23:30,950
in supervising various physicists and
mathematicians who are phd students and

11902
03:23:30,950 --> 03:23:30,960
mathematicians who are phd students and
 

11903
03:23:30,960 --> 03:23:33,030
mathematicians who are phd students and
i you know their math is way beyond what

11904
03:23:33,030 --> 03:23:33,040
i you know their math is way beyond what
 

11905
03:23:33,040 --> 03:23:34,309
i you know their math is way beyond what
i can do

11906
03:23:34,309 --> 03:23:34,319
i can do
 

11907
03:23:34,319 --> 03:23:36,550
i can do
but the process of trying to work out

11908
03:23:36,550 --> 03:23:36,560
but the process of trying to work out
 

11909
03:23:36,560 --> 03:23:37,830
but the process of trying to work out
what are we actually going to model here

11910
03:23:37,830 --> 03:23:37,840
what are we actually going to model here
 

11911
03:23:37,840 --> 03:23:39,349
what are we actually going to model here
what's going into this equation is a

11912
03:23:39,349 --> 03:23:39,359
what's going into this equation is a
 

11913
03:23:39,359 --> 03:23:40,630
what's going into this equation is a
very similar one to writing what am i

11914
03:23:40,630 --> 03:23:40,640
very similar one to writing what am i
 

11915
03:23:40,640 --> 03:23:42,309
very similar one to writing what am i
going to put on a page what's the

11916
03:23:42,309 --> 03:23:42,319
going to put on a page what's the
 

11917
03:23:42,319 --> 03:23:44,469
going to put on a page what's the
simplest possible way i can encapsulate

11918
03:23:44,469 --> 03:23:44,479
simplest possible way i can encapsulate
 

11919
03:23:44,479 --> 03:23:46,630
simplest possible way i can encapsulate
this idea so that i now have it as a

11920
03:23:46,630 --> 03:23:46,640
this idea so that i now have it as a
 

11921
03:23:46,640 --> 03:23:48,389
this idea so that i now have it as a
unit that i can kind of see how it

11922
03:23:48,389 --> 03:23:48,399
unit that i can kind of see how it
 

11923
03:23:48,399 --> 03:23:50,389
unit that i can kind of see how it
interacts with the other units

11924
03:23:50,389 --> 03:23:50,399
interacts with the other units
 

11925
03:23:50,399 --> 03:23:52,469
interacts with the other units
and you realize that well if this is

11926
03:23:52,469 --> 03:23:52,479
and you realize that well if this is
 

11927
03:23:52,479 --> 03:23:53,990
and you realize that well if this is
like that and this is like this then

11928
03:23:53,990 --> 03:23:54,000
like that and this is like this then
 

11929
03:23:54,000 --> 03:23:56,150
like that and this is like this then
then that can't be true

11930
03:23:56,150 --> 03:23:56,160
then that can't be true
 

11931
03:23:56,160 --> 03:23:58,070
then that can't be true
um

11932
03:23:58,070 --> 03:23:58,080
um
 

11933
03:23:58,080 --> 03:24:00,389
um
so you end up navigating your own path

11934
03:24:00,389 --> 03:24:00,399
so you end up navigating your own path
 

11935
03:24:00,399 --> 03:24:02,469
so you end up navigating your own path
through this landscape and that can be

11936
03:24:02,469 --> 03:24:02,479
through this landscape and that can be
 

11937
03:24:02,479 --> 03:24:03,349
through this landscape and that can be
thrilling because you don't know where

11938
03:24:03,349 --> 03:24:03,359
thrilling because you don't know where
 

11939
03:24:03,359 --> 03:24:04,469
thrilling because you don't know where
it's going

11940
03:24:04,469 --> 03:24:04,479
it's going
 

11941
03:24:04,479 --> 03:24:05,349
it's going
um

11942
03:24:05,349 --> 03:24:05,359
um
 

11943
03:24:05,359 --> 03:24:06,950
um
and i'd like to think that that's one of

11944
03:24:06,950 --> 03:24:06,960
and i'd like to think that that's one of
 

11945
03:24:06,960 --> 03:24:08,710
and i'd like to think that that's one of
the reasons my books have worked for

11946
03:24:08,710 --> 03:24:08,720
the reasons my books have worked for
 

11947
03:24:08,720 --> 03:24:10,469
the reasons my books have worked for
people because this sense of the

11948
03:24:10,469 --> 03:24:10,479
people because this sense of the
 

11949
03:24:10,479 --> 03:24:12,309
people because this sense of the
thrilling adventure ride i don't know

11950
03:24:12,309 --> 03:24:12,319
thrilling adventure ride i don't know
 

11951
03:24:12,319 --> 03:24:13,990
thrilling adventure ride i don't know
where it's going either

11952
03:24:13,990 --> 03:24:14,000
where it's going either
 

11953
03:24:14,000 --> 03:24:16,469
where it's going either
so the finding the simplest possible way

11954
03:24:16,469 --> 03:24:16,479
so the finding the simplest possible way
 

11955
03:24:16,479 --> 03:24:18,550
so the finding the simplest possible way
to explain the things we know and the

11956
03:24:18,550 --> 03:24:18,560
to explain the things we know and the
 

11957
03:24:18,560 --> 03:24:19,990
to explain the things we know and the
simplest possible way to explain the

11958
03:24:19,990 --> 03:24:20,000
simplest possible way to explain the
 

11959
03:24:20,000 --> 03:24:21,349
simplest possible way to explain the
things we don't know and the tension

11960
03:24:21,349 --> 03:24:21,359
things we don't know and the tension
 

11961
03:24:21,359 --> 03:24:23,190
things we don't know and the tension
between those two and that's where the

11962
03:24:23,190 --> 03:24:23,200
between those two and that's where the
 

11963
03:24:23,200 --> 03:24:25,030
between those two and that's where the
story emerges

11964
03:24:25,030 --> 03:24:25,040
story emerges
 

11965
03:24:25,040 --> 03:24:27,110
story emerges
what about the edit

11966
03:24:27,110 --> 03:24:27,120
what about the edit
 

11967
03:24:27,120 --> 03:24:29,510
what about the edit
do you find yourself

11968
03:24:29,510 --> 03:24:29,520
do you find yourself
 

11969
03:24:29,520 --> 03:24:31,670
do you find yourself
to the point of this

11970

to the point of this
uh

11972
03:24:32,790 --> 03:24:32,800
uh
 

11973
03:24:32,800 --> 03:24:36,229
uh
you know editing dial to mostly harmless

11974
03:24:36,229 --> 03:24:36,239
you know editing dial to mostly harmless
 

11975
03:24:36,239 --> 03:24:39,190
you know editing dial to mostly harmless
to arrive at simplicity do you find

11976
03:24:39,190 --> 03:24:39,200
to arrive at simplicity do you find
 

11977
03:24:39,200 --> 03:24:41,030
to arrive at simplicity do you find
the edit as productive or does it

11978
03:24:41,030 --> 03:24:41,040
the edit as productive or does it
 

11979
03:24:41,040 --> 03:24:42,790
the edit as productive or does it
destroy the the magic that was

11980
03:24:42,790 --> 03:24:42,800
destroy the the magic that was
 

11981
03:24:42,800 --> 03:24:44,150
destroy the the magic that was
originally there

11982
03:24:44,150 --> 03:24:44,160
originally there
 

11983
03:24:44,160 --> 03:24:47,030
originally there
no i usually find i i think i'm perhaps

11984
03:24:47,030 --> 03:24:47,040
no i usually find i i think i'm perhaps
 

11985
03:24:47,040 --> 03:24:49,269
no i usually find i i think i'm perhaps
a better editor than i am a writer i i

11986
03:24:49,269 --> 03:24:49,279
a better editor than i am a writer i i
 

11987
03:24:49,279 --> 03:24:50,710
a better editor than i am a writer i i
write and rewrite and rewrite and

11988
03:24:50,710 --> 03:24:50,720
write and rewrite and rewrite and
 

11989
03:24:50,720 --> 03:24:52,389
write and rewrite and rewrite and
rewrite put a bunch of crap on the page

11990
03:24:52,389 --> 03:24:52,399
rewrite put a bunch of crap on the page
 

11991
03:24:52,399 --> 03:24:54,229
rewrite put a bunch of crap on the page
first and then see

11992
03:24:54,229 --> 03:24:54,239
first and then see
 

11993
03:24:54,239 --> 03:24:56,150
first and then see
the edit where it takes yeah

11994
03:24:56,150 --> 03:24:56,160
the edit where it takes yeah
 

11995
03:24:56,160 --> 03:24:57,670
the edit where it takes yeah
but then then there's the professional

11996
03:24:57,670 --> 03:24:57,680
but then then there's the professional
 

11997
03:24:57,680 --> 03:24:59,910
but then then there's the professional
editors who come along as well and um i

11998
03:24:59,910 --> 03:24:59,920
editors who come along as well and um i
 

11999
03:24:59,920 --> 03:25:00,630
editors who come along as well and um i
mean

12000
03:25:00,630 --> 03:25:00,640
mean
 

12001
03:25:00,640 --> 03:25:03,030
mean
in in transformer um

12002
03:25:03,030 --> 03:25:03,040
in in transformer um
 

12003
03:25:03,040 --> 03:25:05,269
in in transformer um
the editor came back to me uh after i

12004
03:25:05,269 --> 03:25:05,279
the editor came back to me uh after i
 

12005
03:25:05,279 --> 03:25:07,030
the editor came back to me uh after i
sent him two months after i sent the

12006
03:25:07,030 --> 03:25:07,040
sent him two months after i sent the
 

12007
03:25:07,040 --> 03:25:08,469
sent him two months after i sent the
first edition he'd read the whole thing

12008
03:25:08,469 --> 03:25:08,479
first edition he'd read the whole thing
 

12009
03:25:08,479 --> 03:25:09,590
first edition he'd read the whole thing
and he said

12010
03:25:09,590 --> 03:25:09,600
and he said
 

12011
03:25:09,600 --> 03:25:11,510
and he said
the first two chapters prevent a

12012
03:25:11,510 --> 03:25:11,520
the first two chapters prevent a
 

12013
03:25:11,520 --> 03:25:14,070
the first two chapters prevent a
formidable hurdle to the general reader

12014
03:25:14,070 --> 03:25:14,080
formidable hurdle to the general reader
 

12015
03:25:14,080 --> 03:25:17,190
formidable hurdle to the general reader
go and do something about it yes and

email but uh i i i i thought about it
 

12025
03:25:25,760 --> 03:25:27,590
email but uh i i i i thought about it
and you know the bottom line is he was

12026
03:25:27,590 --> 03:25:27,600
and you know the bottom line is he was
 

12027
03:25:27,600 --> 03:25:28,710
and you know the bottom line is he was

right
 

12029
03:25:28,720 --> 03:25:31,429
right
and so i put the whole thing aside for

12030
03:25:31,429 --> 03:25:31,439
and so i put the whole thing aside for
 

12031
03:25:31,439 --> 03:25:32,790
and so i put the whole thing aside for
about two months

12032
03:25:32,790 --> 03:25:32,800
about two months
 

12033
03:25:32,800 --> 03:25:34,870
about two months
uh spent the summer this would have been

12034
03:25:34,870 --> 03:25:34,880
uh spent the summer this would have been
 

12035
03:25:34,880 --> 03:25:36,469
uh spent the summer this would have been
i guess last summer

12036
03:25:36,469 --> 03:25:36,479
i guess last summer
 

12037
03:25:36,479 --> 03:25:38,469
i guess last summer
uh and then turned to it with full

12038
03:25:38,469 --> 03:25:38,479
uh and then turned to it with full
 

12039
03:25:38,479 --> 03:25:40,389
uh and then turned to it with full
attention in about september or

12040
03:25:40,389 --> 03:25:40,399
attention in about september or
 

12041
03:25:40,399 --> 03:25:41,990
attention in about september or
something and rewrote those chapters

12042
03:25:41,990 --> 03:25:42,000
something and rewrote those chapters
 

12043
03:25:42,000 --> 03:25:43,429
something and rewrote those chapters
almost from scratch i kept some of the

12044
03:25:43,429 --> 03:25:43,439
almost from scratch i kept some of the
 

12045
03:25:43,439 --> 03:25:45,269
almost from scratch i kept some of the
material but

12046
03:25:45,269 --> 03:25:45,279
material but
 

12047
03:25:45,279 --> 03:25:47,269
material but
it took me a long time to process it to

12048
03:25:47,269 --> 03:25:47,279
it took me a long time to process it to
 

12049
03:25:47,279 --> 03:25:49,269
it took me a long time to process it to
work out what needs to change where does

12050
03:25:49,269 --> 03:25:49,279
work out what needs to change where does
 

12051
03:25:49,279 --> 03:25:51,269
work out what needs to change where does
it need to i wasn't writing in this time

12052
03:25:51,269 --> 03:25:51,279
it need to i wasn't writing in this time
 

12053
03:25:51,279 --> 03:25:53,190
it need to i wasn't writing in this time
how am i going to tell this story better

12054
03:25:53,190 --> 03:25:53,200
how am i going to tell this story better
 

12055
03:25:53,200 --> 03:25:54,710
how am i going to tell this story better
so it's more accessible and interesting

12056
03:25:54,710 --> 03:25:54,720
so it's more accessible and interesting
 

12057
03:25:54,720 --> 03:25:56,070
so it's more accessible and interesting
and in the end

12058
03:25:56,070 --> 03:25:56,080
and in the end
 

12059
03:25:56,080 --> 03:25:57,830
and in the end
i think it was still it's still

i think it was still it's still
 

12061
03:25:57,840 --> 03:25:59,590
i think it was still it's still
difficult it's still biochemistry but

12062
03:25:59,590 --> 03:25:59,600
difficult it's still biochemistry but
 

12063
03:25:59,600 --> 03:26:01,750
difficult it's still biochemistry but
but it has he ended up saying now he's

but it has he ended up saying now he's
 

12065
03:26:01,760 --> 03:26:04,070
but it has he ended up saying now he's
got a barreling energy to it and i was

12066
03:26:04,070 --> 03:26:04,080
got a barreling energy to it and i was

because they they're often
 

12117
03:26:57,279 --> 03:26:59,429
because they they're often
worried that if they make this decision

12118
03:26:59,429 --> 03:26:59,439
worried that if they make this decision
 

12119
03:26:59,439 --> 03:27:01,269
worried that if they make this decision
now and and do this course instead of

12120
03:27:01,269 --> 03:27:01,279
now and and do this course instead of
 

12121
03:27:01,279 --> 03:27:02,309
now and and do this course instead of
that course then they're going to

12122
03:27:02,309 --> 03:27:02,319
that course then they're going to
 

12123
03:27:02,319 --> 03:27:05,269
that course then they're going to
restrict their career opportunities and

12124
03:27:05,269 --> 03:27:05,279
restrict their career opportunities and
 

12125
03:27:05,279 --> 03:27:06,070
restrict their career opportunities and
um

12126
03:27:06,070 --> 03:27:06,080
um
 

12127
03:27:06,080 --> 03:27:08,070
um
there isn't a career path in science

12128
03:27:08,070 --> 03:27:08,080
there isn't a career path in science
 

12129
03:27:08,080 --> 03:27:10,469
there isn't a career path in science
it's it's not i mean that there is but

12130
03:27:10,469 --> 03:27:10,479
it's it's not i mean that there is but
 

12131
03:27:10,479 --> 03:27:12,710
it's it's not i mean that there is but
there isn't um

there isn't um
 

12133
03:27:12,720 --> 03:27:14,150
there isn't um
there's a lot of competition there's a

12134

there's a lot of competition there's a
 

12135
03:27:14,160 --> 03:27:15,349
there's a lot of competition there's a
lot of death

12136
03:27:15,349 --> 03:27:15,359
lot of death
 

12137
03:27:15,359 --> 03:27:16,710
lot of death
symbolically

12138
03:27:16,710 --> 03:27:16,720
symbolically
 

12139
03:27:16,720 --> 03:27:19,030
symbolically
um so who survives

12140
03:27:19,030 --> 03:27:19,040
um so who survives
 

12141
03:27:19,040 --> 03:27:20,790
um so who survives
the people who survive are the people

12142
03:27:20,790 --> 03:27:20,800
the people who survive are the people
 

12143
03:27:20,800 --> 03:27:21,750
the people who survive are the people
who

12144
03:27:21,750 --> 03:27:21,760
who
 

12145
03:27:21,760 --> 03:27:22,870
who
care

12146
03:27:22,870 --> 03:27:22,880
care
 

12147
03:27:22,880 --> 03:27:23,990
care
enough

12148
03:27:23,990 --> 03:27:24,000
enough
 

12149
03:27:24,000 --> 03:27:26,150
enough
to still do it and they're very often

12150
03:27:26,150 --> 03:27:26,160
to still do it and they're very often
 

12151
03:27:26,160 --> 03:27:28,790
to still do it and they're very often
the people who

12152
03:27:28,790 --> 03:27:28,800
the people who
 

12153
03:27:28,800 --> 03:27:31,110
the people who
don't worry too much about the future

12154
03:27:31,110 --> 03:27:31,120
don't worry too much about the future
 

12155
03:27:31,120 --> 03:27:33,269
don't worry too much about the future
and are able to live in the present

12156
03:27:33,269 --> 03:27:33,279
and are able to live in the present
 

12157
03:27:33,279 --> 03:27:35,269
and are able to live in the present
because if you you know you do a phd

12158
03:27:35,269 --> 03:27:35,279
because if you you know you do a phd
 

12159
03:27:35,279 --> 03:27:37,269
because if you you know you do a phd
you've competed hard to get onto the phd

12160
03:27:37,269 --> 03:27:37,279
you've competed hard to get onto the phd
 

12161
03:27:37,279 --> 03:27:38,630
you've competed hard to get onto the phd
then you have to compete hard to get a

12162
03:27:38,630 --> 03:27:38,640
then you have to compete hard to get a
 

12163
03:27:38,640 --> 03:27:40,950
then you have to compete hard to get a
post-doc job and

12164
03:27:40,950 --> 03:27:40,960
post-doc job and
 

12165
03:27:40,960 --> 03:27:43,030
post-doc job and
you have you know the next bond maybe on

12166
03:27:43,030 --> 03:27:43,040
you have you know the next bond maybe on
 

12167
03:27:43,040 --> 03:27:44,870
you have you know the next bond maybe on
another continent and it's only two

12168
03:27:44,870 --> 03:27:44,880
another continent and it's only two
 

12169
03:27:44,880 --> 03:27:47,590
another continent and it's only two
years anyway and and so and there's no

12170
03:27:47,590 --> 03:27:47,600
years anyway and and so and there's no
 

12171
03:27:47,600 --> 03:27:49,510
years anyway and and so and there's no
there's no uh guarantee you're going to

12172
03:27:49,510 --> 03:27:49,520
there's no uh guarantee you're going to
 

12173
03:27:49,520 --> 03:27:52,229
there's no uh guarantee you're going to
get a faculty position at the end of it

12174
03:27:52,229 --> 03:27:52,239
get a faculty position at the end of it
 

12175
03:27:52,239 --> 03:27:54,309
get a faculty position at the end of it
so and there's always the next step to

12176
03:27:54,309 --> 03:27:54,319
so and there's always the next step to
 

12177
03:27:54,319 --> 03:27:56,790
so and there's always the next step to
compete if you get a faculty position

12178
03:27:56,790 --> 03:27:56,800
compete if you get a faculty position
 

12179
03:27:56,800 --> 03:27:59,190
compete if you get a faculty position
you get a tenure and with 10 you go full

12180
03:27:59,190 --> 03:27:59,200
you get a tenure and with 10 you go full
 

12181
03:27:59,200 --> 03:28:01,110
you get a tenure and with 10 you go full
professor and full professor then you go

12182
03:28:01,110 --> 03:28:01,120
professor and full professor then you go
 

12183
03:28:01,120 --> 03:28:02,870
professor and full professor then you go
to some kind of whatever the discipline

12184
03:28:02,870 --> 03:28:02,880
to some kind of whatever the discipline
 

12185
03:28:02,880 --> 03:28:05,110
to some kind of whatever the discipline
is there's an award if you're in physics

12186
03:28:05,110 --> 03:28:05,120
is there's an award if you're in physics
 

12187
03:28:05,120 --> 03:28:06,550
is there's an award if you're in physics
you're always competing for the nobel

12188
03:28:06,550 --> 03:28:06,560
you're always competing for the nobel
 

12189
03:28:06,560 --> 03:28:08,389
you're always competing for the nobel
prize there's different awards yeah and

12190
03:28:08,389 --> 03:28:08,399
prize there's different awards yeah and
 

12191
03:28:08,399 --> 03:28:11,110
prize there's different awards yeah and
then eventually you're all competing to

12192
03:28:11,110 --> 03:28:11,120
then eventually you're all competing to
 

12193
03:28:11,120 --> 03:28:12,790
then eventually you're all competing to
i mean there's always a competition so

12194
03:28:12,790 --> 03:28:12,800
i mean there's always a competition so
 

12195
03:28:12,800 --> 03:28:14,630
i mean there's always a competition so
there is no happiness happiness does not

12196
03:28:14,630 --> 03:28:14,640
there is no happiness happiness does not
 

12197

lie if you're looking into the future
 

12199
03:28:16,239 --> 03:28:18,309
lie if you're looking into the future
yes and if what you're caring about is a

it's probably not the one for you
if though you can put that aside and you

12206
03:28:25,830 --> 03:28:25,840
if though you can put that aside and you
 

12207

brief period and uh and i was made
 

12211
03:28:29,920 --> 03:28:34,550
brief period and uh and i was made
redundant twice so i i know that uh that

12212
03:28:34,550 --> 03:28:34,560

 

12213
03:28:34,560 --> 03:28:36,309

you know there's no guarantee she got a

12214

to help you out if you really care and

12266
03:29:27,670 --> 03:29:27,680
to help you out if you really care and
 

12267
03:29:27,680 --> 03:29:28,950
to help you out if you really care and
you're not going to have a job two years

12268
03:29:28,950 --> 03:29:28,960
you're not going to have a job two years
 

12269
03:29:28,960 --> 03:29:30,710
you're not going to have a job two years
down the line but if you what you really

12270
03:29:30,710 --> 03:29:30,720
down the line but if you what you really
 

12271
03:29:30,720 --> 03:29:32,710
down the line but if you what you really
care about is what you're doing now

12272
03:29:32,710 --> 03:29:32,720
care about is what you're doing now
 

12273
03:29:32,720 --> 03:29:33,990
care about is what you're doing now
then it doesn't matter if you have a job

12274
03:29:33,990 --> 03:29:34,000
then it doesn't matter if you have a job
 

12275
03:29:34,000 --> 03:29:35,910
then it doesn't matter if you have a job
in two years time or not it'll work

12276
03:29:35,910 --> 03:29:35,920
in two years time or not it'll work
 

12277
03:29:35,920 --> 03:29:38,070
in two years time or not it'll work
itself out if you've got the light in

12278
03:29:38,070 --> 03:29:38,080
itself out if you've got the light in
 

12279
03:29:38,080 --> 03:29:39,110
itself out if you've got the light in
your eye

12280
03:29:39,110 --> 03:29:39,120
your eye
 

12281
03:29:39,120 --> 03:29:40,870
your eye
um and so

12282
03:29:40,870 --> 03:29:40,880
um and so
 

12283
03:29:40,880 --> 03:29:42,309
um and so
that's the only advice i can give and

12284
03:29:42,309 --> 03:29:42,319
that's the only advice i can give and
 

12285
03:29:42,319 --> 03:29:43,750
that's the only advice i can give and
most people

12286
03:29:43,750 --> 03:29:43,760
most people
 

12287
03:29:43,760 --> 03:29:45,349
most people
probably

12288
03:29:45,349 --> 03:29:45,359
probably
 

12289
03:29:45,359 --> 03:29:47,269
probably
drop out through that system because the

12290
03:29:47,269 --> 03:29:47,279
drop out through that system because the
 

12291
03:29:47,279 --> 03:29:49,670
drop out through that system because the
fight is just not worth it for them

12292
03:29:49,670 --> 03:29:49,680
fight is just not worth it for them
 

12293
03:29:49,680 --> 03:29:51,750
fight is just not worth it for them
yeah when you have the light in your eye

12294
03:29:51,750 --> 03:29:51,760
yeah when you have the light in your eye
 

12295
03:29:51,760 --> 03:29:53,030
yeah when you have the light in your eye
when you have the excitement for the

12296
03:29:53,030 --> 03:29:53,040
when you have the excitement for the
 

12297
03:29:53,040 --> 03:29:54,870
when you have the excitement for the
thing what happens is you start to

12298
03:29:54,870 --> 03:29:54,880
thing what happens is you start to
 

12299
03:29:54,880 --> 03:29:56,630
thing what happens is you start to
surround yourself with others they're

12300
03:29:56,630 --> 03:29:56,640
surround yourself with others they're
 

12301
03:29:56,640 --> 03:29:58,229
surround yourself with others they're
interested in that same thing that also

12302
03:29:58,229 --> 03:29:58,239
interested in that same thing that also
 

12303
03:29:58,239 --> 03:30:00,070
interested in that same thing that also
have the light if you really are

12304
03:30:00,070 --> 03:30:00,080
have the light if you really are
 

12305
03:30:00,080 --> 03:30:02,710
have the light if you really are
rigorous about this because i think it

12306
03:30:02,710 --> 03:30:02,720
rigorous about this because i think it
 

12307
03:30:02,720 --> 03:30:05,190
rigorous about this because i think it
does take it's it doesn't

12308
03:30:05,190 --> 03:30:05,200
does take it's it doesn't
 

12309
03:30:05,200 --> 03:30:06,790
does take it's it doesn't
it takes effort

12310
03:30:06,790 --> 03:30:06,800
it takes effort
 

12311
03:30:06,800 --> 03:30:08,710
it takes effort
to make oh you've got to be obsessive

12312
03:30:08,710 --> 03:30:08,720
to make oh you've got to be obsessive
 

12313

it's what you do yeah but i also mean
 

12319
03:30:14,160 --> 03:30:15,830
it's what you do yeah but i also mean
the surrounding yourself with other

12320
03:30:15,830 --> 03:30:15,840
the surrounding yourself with other
 

12321
03:30:15,840 --> 03:30:17,510
the surrounding yourself with other
people that are obsessed about the same

03:30:18,469 --> 03:30:18,479
thing because
 

12325
03:30:18,479 --> 03:30:19,830
thing because
depending on that takes some work as

12326
03:30:19,830 --> 03:30:19,840
depending on that takes some work as
 

12327

i suppose the subject
as much as you pursue the people that do

12370

take that that
 

12379
03:31:13,680 --> 03:31:15,910
take that that
that part seriously and probably in the

12380
03:31:15,910 --> 03:31:15,920
that part seriously and probably in the
 

12381
03:31:15,920 --> 03:31:19,190
that part seriously and probably in the
way you're describing it

12382
03:31:19,190 --> 03:31:19,200
way you're describing it
 

12383
03:31:19,200 --> 03:31:21,670

careful how you define success
 

12385
03:31:21,680 --> 03:31:23,670

because uh you'll never find happiness
 

12387
03:31:23,680 --> 03:31:26,150
because uh you'll never find happiness
in success and there's a lovely quote uh

12388
03:31:26,150 --> 03:31:26,160
in success and there's a lovely quote uh
 

12389
03:31:26,160 --> 03:31:27,910
in success and there's a lovely quote uh
from robert lewis stevenson i think who

12390
03:31:27,910 --> 03:31:27,920
from robert lewis stevenson i think who
 

12391
03:31:27,920 --> 03:31:30,389
from robert lewis stevenson i think who
said nothing in life is so disenchanting

12392
03:31:30,389 --> 03:31:30,399
said nothing in life is so disenchanting
 

12393
03:31:30,399 --> 03:31:33,030
said nothing in life is so disenchanting
as attainment

12394
03:31:33,030 --> 03:31:33,040
as attainment
 

12395
03:31:33,040 --> 03:31:35,670
as attainment
yeah so i mean in in some sense

12396
03:31:35,670 --> 03:31:35,680
yeah so i mean in in some sense
 

12397
03:31:35,680 --> 03:31:37,670
yeah so i mean in in some sense
the the the true definition of success

12398
03:31:37,670 --> 03:31:37,680
the the the true definition of success
 

12399
03:31:37,680 --> 03:31:39,670
the the the true definition of success
is

12400
03:31:39,670 --> 03:31:39,680
is
 

12401
03:31:39,680 --> 03:31:41,910
is
you're getting to do today

12402
03:31:41,910 --> 03:31:41,920
you're getting to do today
 

12403
03:31:41,920 --> 03:31:45,030
you're getting to do today
what you really enjoy doing just uh what

12404
03:31:45,030 --> 03:31:45,040
what you really enjoy doing just uh what
 

12405
03:31:45,040 --> 03:31:47,110
what you really enjoy doing just uh what
fills you with joy and that's ultimately

12406
03:31:47,110 --> 03:31:47,120
fills you with joy and that's ultimately
 

12407
03:31:47,120 --> 03:31:49,910
fills you with joy and that's ultimately
success so success isn't the thing

12408
03:31:49,910 --> 03:31:49,920
success so success isn't the thing
 

12409
03:31:49,920 --> 03:31:53,110
success so success isn't the thing

the big trophy the the financial i think
it's it's as close as we can get to

12414
03:31:56,710 --> 03:31:56,720
it's it's as close as we can get to

12417
03:31:58,800 --> 03:32:00,630
happiness that's not to say you're full
of joy all the time but it's it's as

12418
03:32:00,630 --> 03:32:00,640
of joy all the time but it's it's as
 

12419
03:32:00,640 --> 03:32:02,950
of joy all the time but it's it's as
close as we can get to a sustained human

12420
03:32:02,950 --> 03:32:02,960
close as we can get to a sustained human
 

12421
03:32:02,960 --> 03:32:05,110
close as we can get to a sustained human

couldn't agree more
um so you know the the summary from

12496
03:33:23,190 --> 03:33:23,200
um so you know the the summary from
 

12497
03:33:23,200 --> 03:33:25,590
um so you know the the summary from
harmless to mostly harmless

12498
03:33:25,590 --> 03:33:25,600
harmless to mostly harmless
 

12499

in hitchhiker's guide to the galaxy how

12500
03:33:27,670 --> 03:33:27,680
in hitchhiker's guide to the galaxy how
 

12501
03:33:27,680 --> 03:33:30,550
in hitchhiker's guide to the galaxy how
would you try to summarize

12502
03:33:30,550 --> 03:33:30,560
would you try to summarize
 

12503
03:33:30,560 --> 03:33:32,710
would you try to summarize
earth and um

12504
03:33:32,710 --> 03:33:32,720
earth and um
 

12505
03:33:32,720 --> 03:33:34,469
earth and um
you know if you were given

12506
03:33:34,469 --> 03:33:34,479
you know if you were given
 

12507
03:33:34,479 --> 03:33:36,389
you know if you were given
if you have to summarize the whole thing

12508
03:33:36,389 --> 03:33:36,399
if you have to summarize the whole thing
 

12509
03:33:36,399 --> 03:33:38,950
if you have to summarize the whole thing
in in a couple of sentences and maybe

12510
03:33:38,950 --> 03:33:38,960
in in a couple of sentences and maybe
 

12511
03:33:38,960 --> 03:33:40,550
in in a couple of sentences and maybe
throwing meaning of life in there like

12512
03:33:40,550 --> 03:33:40,560
throwing meaning of life in there like
 

12513
03:33:40,560 --> 03:33:43,349
throwing meaning of life in there like
what why why

12514
03:33:43,349 --> 03:33:43,359
what why why
 

12515
03:33:43,359 --> 03:33:45,269
what why why
why

12516
03:33:45,269 --> 03:33:45,279
why
 

12517
03:33:45,279 --> 03:33:46,950
why
maybe is that a defining thing about

12518
03:33:46,950 --> 03:33:46,960
maybe is that a defining thing about
 

12519
03:33:46,960 --> 03:33:50,550
maybe is that a defining thing about
humans that we care about the meaning

12520
03:33:50,550 --> 03:33:50,560
humans that we care about the meaning
 

12521
03:33:50,560 --> 03:33:52,389
humans that we care about the meaning
of the whole thing

12522
03:33:52,389 --> 03:33:52,399
of the whole thing
 

12523
03:33:52,399 --> 03:33:54,229
of the whole thing
i wonder i wonder if that should be part

12524
03:33:54,229 --> 03:33:54,239
i wonder i wonder if that should be part
 

12525
03:33:54,239 --> 03:33:56,790
i wonder i wonder if that should be part
of the the the these creatures seem to

12526
03:33:56,790 --> 03:33:56,800
of the the the these creatures seem to
 

12527
03:33:56,800 --> 03:33:58,630
of the the the these creatures seem to
be very lost

12528
03:33:58,630 --> 03:33:58,640
be very lost
 

12529
03:33:58,640 --> 03:34:00,469
be very lost
yes they're always asking why i mean

12530
03:34:00,469 --> 03:34:00,479
yes they're always asking why i mean
 

12531
03:34:00,479 --> 03:34:02,710
yes they're always asking why i mean
that's my defining question is why

12532
03:34:02,710 --> 03:34:02,720
that's my defining question is why
 

12533
03:34:02,720 --> 03:34:05,349
that's my defining question is why
it was uh

12534
03:34:05,349 --> 03:34:05,359

 

12535
03:34:05,359 --> 03:34:06,950

people used to made a joke i have a

12536
03:34:06,950 --> 03:34:06,960
people used to made a joke i have a
 

12537

03:34:08,710 --> 03:34:08,720
small scar on my forehead from a
 

12539
03:34:08,720 --> 03:34:10,630
small scar on my forehead from a
climbing accident years ago

12540
03:34:10,630 --> 03:34:10,640
climbing accident years ago
 

12541
03:34:10,640 --> 03:34:12,550
climbing accident years ago
uh and the guy i was climbing with had

12542
03:34:12,550 --> 03:34:12,560
uh and the guy i was climbing with had
 

12543
03:34:12,560 --> 03:34:14,790
uh and the guy i was climbing with had
dislodged a rock and he shouted

12544
03:34:14,790 --> 03:34:14,800
dislodged a rock and he shouted
 

12545
03:34:14,800 --> 03:34:16,710
dislodged a rock and he shouted
something he shot below i think meaning

12546
03:34:16,710 --> 03:34:16,720
something he shot below i think meaning
 

12547
03:34:16,720 --> 03:34:18,389
something he shot below i think meaning
that the rock was coming down

12548
03:34:18,389 --> 03:34:18,399
that the rock was coming down
 

12549
03:34:18,399 --> 03:34:20,070
that the rock was coming down
and uh and i hadn't caught what he said

12550
03:34:20,070 --> 03:34:20,080
and uh and i hadn't caught what he said
 

12551
03:34:20,080 --> 03:34:21,830
and uh and i hadn't caught what he said
so i looked up and smashed straight on

12552
03:34:21,830 --> 03:34:21,840
so i looked up and smashed straight on
 

12553
03:34:21,840 --> 03:34:25,830
so i looked up and smashed straight on
my forehead and um and everybody around

12554
03:34:25,830 --> 03:34:25,840
my forehead and um and everybody around
 

12555
03:34:25,840 --> 03:34:27,190
my forehead and um and everybody around
me

12556
03:34:27,190 --> 03:34:27,200
me
 

12557
03:34:27,200 --> 03:34:29,349
me
took the piss saying he he looked up to

12558
03:34:29,349 --> 03:34:29,359
took the piss saying he he looked up to
 

12559
03:34:29,359 --> 03:34:32,309
took the piss saying he he looked up to
ask why

12560
03:34:32,309 --> 03:34:32,319

 

12561
03:34:32,319 --> 03:34:34,469

yeah but that that's a human imperative

12562
03:34:34,469 --> 03:34:34,479
yeah but that that's a human imperative
 

12563
03:34:34,479 --> 03:34:37,030
yeah but that that's a human imperative
that's part of what it means to be human

12564
03:34:37,030 --> 03:34:37,040
that's part of what it means to be human
 

12565
03:34:37,040 --> 03:34:39,510
that's part of what it means to be human
look up to the sky and ask why

12566
03:34:39,510 --> 03:34:39,520
look up to the sky and ask why
 

12567
03:34:39,520 --> 03:34:40,870
look up to the sky and ask why
and ask why

12568
03:34:40,870 --> 03:34:40,880
and ask why
 

12569
03:34:40,880 --> 03:34:49,030
and ask why
uh so your question defined the earth

12570
03:34:49,030 --> 03:34:49,040

 

12571
03:34:49,040 --> 03:34:50,630

i'm not sure i can do that i mean the

12572
03:34:50,630 --> 03:34:50,640
i'm not sure i can do that i mean the
 

12573
03:34:50,640 --> 03:34:54,630
i'm not sure i can do that i mean the
first word that comes to mind is living

12574
03:34:54,630 --> 03:34:54,640

 

12575
03:34:54,640 --> 03:34:56,229

i wouldn't like to say mostly living but

12576
03:34:56,229 --> 03:34:56,239
i wouldn't like to say mostly living but
 

12577
03:34:56,239 --> 03:34:57,750
i wouldn't like to say mostly living but
perhaps

12578
03:34:57,750 --> 03:34:57,760
perhaps
 

12579
03:34:57,760 --> 03:34:59,670
perhaps
mostly well it's interesting because

12580
03:34:59,670 --> 03:34:59,680
mostly well it's interesting because
 

12581
03:34:59,680 --> 03:35:02,150
mostly well it's interesting because
like if you were to to write the

12582
03:35:02,150 --> 03:35:02,160
like if you were to to write the
 

12583
03:35:02,160 --> 03:35:05,190
like if you were to to write the
hitchhiker's guide to the galaxy

12584
03:35:05,190 --> 03:35:05,200
hitchhiker's guide to the galaxy
 

12585
03:35:05,200 --> 03:35:06,950
hitchhiker's guide to the galaxy
i suppose

12586
03:35:06,950 --> 03:35:06,960
i suppose
 

12587
03:35:06,960 --> 03:35:08,710
i suppose
say our idea

12588
03:35:08,710 --> 03:35:08,720
say our idea
 

12589
03:35:08,720 --> 03:35:11,590
say our idea
uh that we talked about the bacteria is

12590
03:35:11,590 --> 03:35:11,600
uh that we talked about the bacteria is
 

12591
03:35:11,600 --> 03:35:13,590
uh that we talked about the bacteria is
the most prominent form of life

12592
03:35:13,590 --> 03:35:13,600
the most prominent form of life
 

12593
03:35:13,600 --> 03:35:14,630
the most prominent form of life
throughout

12594
03:35:14,630 --> 03:35:14,640
throughout
 

12595
03:35:14,640 --> 03:35:17,750
throughout
the galaxy in the universe

12596
03:35:17,750 --> 03:35:17,760
the galaxy in the universe
 

12597
03:35:17,760 --> 03:35:20,150
the galaxy in the universe
i suppose the earth would be kind of

12598
03:35:20,150 --> 03:35:20,160
i suppose the earth would be kind of
 

12599
03:35:20,160 --> 03:35:21,510
i suppose the earth would be kind of
unique

12600
03:35:21,510 --> 03:35:21,520
unique
 

12601
03:35:21,520 --> 03:35:24,389
unique
and would require abundance in that case

12602
03:35:24,389 --> 03:35:24,399
and would require abundance in that case
 

12603
03:35:24,399 --> 03:35:27,030
and would require abundance in that case
yeah it's profligate it's rich it's

12604
03:35:27,030 --> 03:35:27,040
yeah it's profligate it's rich it's
 

12605
03:35:27,040 --> 03:35:29,830
yeah it's profligate it's rich it's
enormously enormously living

12606
03:35:29,830 --> 03:35:29,840
enormously enormously living
 

12607
03:35:29,840 --> 03:35:31,750
enormously enormously living
so how how would you describe that it's

12608
03:35:31,750 --> 03:35:31,760
so how how would you describe that it's
 

12609
03:35:31,760 --> 03:35:33,269
so how how would you describe that it's
not bacteria

12610
03:35:33,269 --> 03:35:33,279
not bacteria
 

12611
03:35:33,279 --> 03:35:34,790
not bacteria
it's

12612
03:35:34,790 --> 03:35:34,800
it's
 

12613
03:35:34,800 --> 03:35:36,469
it's
um

12614
03:35:36,469 --> 03:35:36,479
um
 

12615
03:35:36,479 --> 03:35:38,950
um
eukaryotic

12616
03:35:38,950 --> 03:35:38,960
eukaryotic
 

12617
03:35:38,960 --> 03:35:40,790
eukaryotic
yeah well i mean that's that's the

12618
03:35:40,790 --> 03:35:40,800
yeah well i mean that's that's the
 

12619
03:35:40,800 --> 03:35:42,710
yeah well i mean that's that's the
technical term but it is basically it's

12620
03:35:42,710 --> 03:35:42,720
technical term but it is basically it's
 

12621
03:35:42,720 --> 03:35:44,790
technical term but it is basically it's
uh

12622
03:35:44,790 --> 03:35:44,800
uh
 

12623
03:35:44,800 --> 03:35:46,309
uh
uh

12624
03:35:46,309 --> 03:35:46,319
uh
 

12625
03:35:46,319 --> 03:35:48,150
uh
yeah and then how would i describe that

12626
03:35:48,150 --> 03:35:48,160
yeah and then how would i describe that
 

12627
03:35:48,160 --> 03:35:50,229
yeah and then how would i describe that
i i've i've actually really struggled

12628
03:35:50,229 --> 03:35:50,239
i i've i've actually really struggled
 

12629
03:35:50,239 --> 03:35:53,429
i i've i've actually really struggled
with that term because

12630
03:35:53,429 --> 03:35:53,439
with that term because
 

12631
03:35:53,439 --> 03:35:55,269
with that term because
the word i mean there's a few words

12632
03:35:55,269 --> 03:35:55,279
the word i mean there's a few words
 

12633
03:35:55,279 --> 03:35:56,950
the word i mean there's a few words
quite as good as eukaryotic to put

12634
03:35:56,950 --> 03:35:56,960
quite as good as eukaryotic to put
 

12635
03:35:56,960 --> 03:35:58,950
quite as good as eukaryotic to put
everybody off immediately you start

12636
03:35:58,950 --> 03:35:58,960
everybody off immediately you start
 

12637
03:35:58,960 --> 03:36:00,469
everybody off immediately you start
using words like that and they'll leave

12638
03:36:00,469 --> 03:36:00,479
using words like that and they'll leave
 

12639
03:36:00,479 --> 03:36:01,349
using words like that and they'll leave
the room

12640
03:36:01,349 --> 03:36:01,359
the room
 

12641
03:36:01,359 --> 03:36:03,349
the room
a krebs cycle is another one that gets

12642
03:36:03,349 --> 03:36:03,359
a krebs cycle is another one that gets
 

12643
03:36:03,359 --> 03:36:04,870
a krebs cycle is another one that gets
people to leave the room

12644
03:36:04,870 --> 03:36:04,880
people to leave the room
 

12645
03:36:04,880 --> 03:36:06,389
people to leave the room
but

12646
03:36:06,389 --> 03:36:06,399
but
 

12647
03:36:06,399 --> 03:36:07,190
but
um

12648
03:36:07,190 --> 03:36:07,200
um
 

12649
03:36:07,200 --> 03:36:08,950
um
but i've tried to think is there another

12650
03:36:08,950 --> 03:36:08,960
but i've tried to think is there another
 

12651
03:36:08,960 --> 03:36:10,950
but i've tried to think is there another
word for eukaryotic that i can use and

12652
03:36:10,950 --> 03:36:10,960
word for eukaryotic that i can use and
 

12653
03:36:10,960 --> 03:36:12,630
word for eukaryotic that i can use and
really the only word that i've i've been

12654
03:36:12,630 --> 03:36:12,640
really the only word that i've i've been
 

12655
03:36:12,640 --> 03:36:15,030
really the only word that i've i've been
able to use is complex

12656
03:36:15,030 --> 03:36:15,040
able to use is complex
 

12657
03:36:15,040 --> 03:36:16,469
able to use is complex
complex cells

12658
03:36:16,469 --> 03:36:16,479
complex cells
 

12659
03:36:16,479 --> 03:36:20,309
complex cells
uh complex life and so on and that word

12660
03:36:20,309 --> 03:36:20,319
uh complex life and so on and that word
 

12661
03:36:20,319 --> 03:36:22,950
uh complex life and so on and that word
it it serves one immediate purpose which

12662
03:36:22,950 --> 03:36:22,960
it it serves one immediate purpose which
 

12663
03:36:22,960 --> 03:36:24,550
it it serves one immediate purpose which
is to convey

12664
03:36:24,550 --> 03:36:24,560
is to convey
 

12665
03:36:24,560 --> 03:36:26,150
is to convey
an impression

12666
03:36:26,150 --> 03:36:26,160
an impression
 

12667
03:36:26,160 --> 03:36:27,670
an impression
but then it it

12668
03:36:27,670 --> 03:36:27,680
but then it it
 

12669
03:36:27,680 --> 03:36:29,990
but then it it
it means so many different things just

12670
03:36:29,990 --> 03:36:30,000
it means so many different things just
 

12671
03:36:30,000 --> 03:36:31,190
it means so many different things just
everybody

12672
03:36:31,190 --> 03:36:31,200
everybody
 

12673
03:36:31,200 --> 03:36:34,070
everybody
that actually is lost immediately and so

12674
03:36:34,070 --> 03:36:34,080
that actually is lost immediately and so
 

12675
03:36:34,080 --> 03:36:36,150
that actually is lost immediately and so
it's kind of

12676
03:36:36,150 --> 03:36:36,160
it's kind of
 

12677
03:36:36,160 --> 03:36:37,750
it's kind of
well that's unnoticeable from the

03:36:37,750 --> 03:36:37,760
well that's unnoticeable from the
 

12679
03:36:37,760 --> 03:36:39,830
well that's unnoticeable from the

03:36:39,830 --> 03:36:39,840

what about the harmless and the mostly

12688
03:36:48,150 --> 03:36:48,160
what about the harmless and the mostly
 

12689
03:36:48,160 --> 03:36:51,510
what about the harmless and the mostly
harmless is that kind of

03:36:51,510 --> 03:36:51,520
harmless is that kind of
 

12691
03:36:51,520 --> 03:36:53,670

03:36:55,349 --> 03:36:55,359
kind of scale
 

12695
03:36:55,359 --> 03:36:57,190
kind of scale
i don't think that uh

12696
03:36:57,190 --> 03:36:57,200
i don't think that uh
 

12697
03:36:57,200 --> 03:36:59,990
i don't think that uh
humanity is in any danger of disturbing

12698
03:36:59,990 --> 03:37:00,000
humanity is in any danger of disturbing
 

12699
03:37:00,000 --> 03:37:03,190
humanity is in any danger of disturbing
the universe at the moment at the moment

that's how many rockets i think uh it'll

12706
03:37:11,030 --> 03:37:11,040
that's how many rockets i think uh it'll
 

12707
03:37:11,040 --> 03:37:13,269
that's how many rockets i think uh it'll
be still even then a while

12708
03:37:13,269 --> 03:37:13,279
be still even then a while
 

12709
03:37:13,279 --> 03:37:15,349
be still even then a while
i think before uh before we disturb the

12710
03:37:15,349 --> 03:37:15,359
i think before uh before we disturb the
 

12711
03:37:15,359 --> 03:37:16,630
i think before uh before we disturb the

12713
03:37:16,640 --> 03:37:19,269

andrei carpathi i think he summarized

12716
03:37:21,429 --> 03:37:21,439
andrei carpathi i think he summarized
 

12717
03:37:21,439 --> 03:37:22,389
andrei carpathi i think he summarized
earth

12718
03:37:22,389 --> 03:37:22,399
earth
 

12719
03:37:22,399 --> 03:37:24,710
earth
as um

12720
03:37:24,710 --> 03:37:24,720
as um
 

12721
03:37:24,720 --> 03:37:26,309
as um
as a system

12722
03:37:26,309 --> 03:37:26,319
as a system
 

12723
03:37:26,319 --> 03:37:28,469
as a system
where you uh hammer it with a bunch of

12724
03:37:28,469 --> 03:37:28,479
where you uh hammer it with a bunch of
 

12725
03:37:28,479 --> 03:37:29,990
where you uh hammer it with a bunch of
photons

12726
03:37:29,990 --> 03:37:30,000
photons
 

12727
03:37:30,000 --> 03:37:32,469
photons
the input is like photons and the output

12728
03:37:32,469 --> 03:37:32,479
the input is like photons and the output
 

12729
03:37:32,479 --> 03:37:35,110
the input is like photons and the output
is rockets

12730
03:37:35,110 --> 03:37:35,120
is rockets
 

12731
03:37:35,120 --> 03:37:36,870
is rockets
see if you just

12732
03:37:36,870 --> 03:37:36,880
see if you just
 

12733
03:37:36,880 --> 03:37:38,309
see if you just
well that's a hell of a lot of photons

12734
03:37:38,309 --> 03:37:38,319
well that's a hell of a lot of photons
 

12735
03:37:38,319 --> 03:37:40,070
well that's a hell of a lot of photons
before it was a rocket launcher yeah

12736
03:37:40,070 --> 03:37:40,080
before it was a rocket launcher yeah
 

12737
03:37:40,080 --> 03:37:41,269
before it was a rocket launcher yeah
but like

12738
03:37:41,269 --> 03:37:41,279
but like
 

12739
03:37:41,279 --> 03:37:43,349
but like
you know maybe maybe in the span of the

12740
03:37:43,349 --> 03:37:43,359
you know maybe maybe in the span of the
 

12741
03:37:43,359 --> 03:37:45,030
you know maybe maybe in the span of the
universe it's not it's not that much

12742
03:37:45,030 --> 03:37:45,040
universe it's not it's not that much
 

12743
03:37:45,040 --> 03:37:45,910
universe it's not it's not that much
time

12744
03:37:45,910 --> 03:37:45,920
time
 

12745
03:37:45,920 --> 03:37:48,550
time
and so and i do wonder

12746
03:37:48,550 --> 03:37:48,560
and so and i do wonder
 

12747
03:37:48,560 --> 03:37:50,070
and so and i do wonder
you know what the future is whether

12748
03:37:50,070 --> 03:37:50,080
you know what the future is whether
 

12749
03:37:50,080 --> 03:37:51,590
you know what the future is whether
we're just in the early beginnings of

12750
03:37:51,590 --> 03:37:51,600
we're just in the early beginnings of
 

12751
03:37:51,600 --> 03:37:52,790
we're just in the early beginnings of
this earth

12752
03:37:52,790 --> 03:37:52,800
this earth
 

12753
03:37:52,800 --> 03:37:54,070
this earth
which is important when you try to

12754
03:37:54,070 --> 03:37:54,080
which is important when you try to
 

12755
03:37:54,080 --> 03:37:55,349
which is important when you try to
summarize it

12756
03:37:55,349 --> 03:37:55,359
summarize it
 

12757
03:37:55,359 --> 03:37:57,510
summarize it
or we're at the end

12758
03:37:57,510 --> 03:37:57,520
or we're at the end
 

12759
03:37:57,520 --> 03:37:59,830
or we're at the end
where humans have finally

12760
03:37:59,830 --> 03:37:59,840
where humans have finally
 

12761
03:37:59,840 --> 03:38:01,830
where humans have finally
gained the ability to destroy

12762
03:38:01,830 --> 03:38:01,840
gained the ability to destroy
 

12763
03:38:01,840 --> 03:38:04,070
gained the ability to destroy
the entirety of this beautiful project

12764
03:38:04,070 --> 03:38:04,080
the entirety of this beautiful project
 

12765
03:38:04,080 --> 03:38:06,070
the entirety of this beautiful project
we got going on

12766
03:38:06,070 --> 03:38:06,080
we got going on
 

12767
03:38:06,080 --> 03:38:08,550
we got going on
now with nuclear weapons with engineered

12768
03:38:08,550 --> 03:38:08,560
now with nuclear weapons with engineered
 

12769
03:38:08,560 --> 03:38:10,070
now with nuclear weapons with engineered
viruses with all those kinds of things

12770
03:38:10,070 --> 03:38:10,080
viruses with all those kinds of things
 

12771
03:38:10,080 --> 03:38:11,990
viruses with all those kinds of things
or just inadvertently through global

12772
03:38:11,990 --> 03:38:12,000
or just inadvertently through global
 

12773
03:38:12,000 --> 03:38:14,870
or just inadvertently through global
warming and pollution and so on

12774
03:38:14,870 --> 03:38:14,880
warming and pollution and so on
 

12775
03:38:14,880 --> 03:38:16,389
warming and pollution and so on
we're quite capable of i mean we just

12776
03:38:16,389 --> 03:38:16,399
we're quite capable of i mean we just
 

12777
03:38:16,399 --> 03:38:18,229
we're quite capable of i mean we just
need to slowly

12778
03:38:18,229 --> 03:38:18,239
need to slowly
 

12779
03:38:18,239 --> 03:38:19,830
need to slowly
i mean i think we're more likely to do

12780
03:38:19,830 --> 03:38:19,840
i mean i think we're more likely to do
 

12781
03:38:19,840 --> 03:38:21,910
i mean i think we're more likely to do
it inadvertently than than through a

12782
03:38:21,910 --> 03:38:21,920
it inadvertently than than through a
 

12783
03:38:21,920 --> 03:38:24,150
it inadvertently than than through a
nuclear war which could happen at any

12784
03:38:24,150 --> 03:38:24,160
nuclear war which could happen at any
 

12785
03:38:24,160 --> 03:38:26,469
nuclear war which could happen at any
time but um

12786
03:38:26,469 --> 03:38:26,479
time but um
 

12787
03:38:26,479 --> 03:38:29,269
time but um
my fear is

12788
03:38:29,269 --> 03:38:29,279
my fear is
 

12789
03:38:29,279 --> 03:38:30,710
my fear is
is we just don't know where the tipping

12790
03:38:30,710 --> 03:38:30,720
is we just don't know where the tipping
 

12791
03:38:30,720 --> 03:38:33,349
is we just don't know where the tipping
points are and we will

12792
03:38:33,349 --> 03:38:33,359
points are and we will
 

12793
03:38:33,359 --> 03:38:35,269
points are and we will
we we kind of think we're smart enough

12794
03:38:35,269 --> 03:38:35,279
we we kind of think we're smart enough
 

12795
03:38:35,279 --> 03:38:36,950
we we kind of think we're smart enough
to fix the problem quickly if we really

12796
03:38:36,950 --> 03:38:36,960
to fix the problem quickly if we really
 

12797
03:38:36,960 --> 03:38:39,030
to fix the problem quickly if we really
need to i think that's that's the

12798
03:38:39,030 --> 03:38:39,040
need to i think that's that's the
 

12799
03:38:39,040 --> 03:38:41,269
need to i think that's that's the
overriding assumption that

12800
03:38:41,269 --> 03:38:41,279
overriding assumption that
 

12801
03:38:41,279 --> 03:38:43,590
overriding assumption that
we're all right for now maybe in 20

12802
03:38:43,590 --> 03:38:43,600
we're all right for now maybe in 20
 

12803
03:38:43,600 --> 03:38:45,269
we're all right for now maybe in 20
years time it's going to be a calamitous

12804
03:38:45,269 --> 03:38:45,279

12805
03:38:45,279 --> 03:38:46,469
years time it's going to be a calamitous
problem and then we'll really need to

12806
03:38:46,469 --> 03:38:46,479
problem and then we'll really need to
 

12807
03:38:46,479 --> 03:38:47,990
problem and then we'll really need to
put some serious mental power into

put some serious mental power into
 

12809
03:38:48,000 --> 03:38:49,670
put some serious mental power into
fixing it

12810
03:38:49,670 --> 03:38:49,680
fixing it
 

12811
03:38:49,680 --> 03:38:51,830
fixing it
without seriously worrying that perhaps

12812
03:38:51,830 --> 03:38:51,840
without seriously worrying that perhaps
 

12813

however brilliant we are
 

12819
03:38:56,720 --> 03:38:59,349
however brilliant we are
it's uh we missed the boat

12820
03:38:59,349 --> 03:38:59,359
it's uh we missed the boat
 

12821
03:38:59,359 --> 03:39:01,590
it's uh we missed the boat
and just walk off the cliff

descendants oh i have no doubt that we
 

12829
03:39:07,600 --> 03:39:09,269
descendants oh i have no doubt that we
can fix the problem

12830
03:39:09,269 --> 03:39:09,279
can fix the problem
 

12831
03:39:09,279 --> 03:39:11,110
can fix the problem
but it's an urgent problem

12832

but it's an urgent problem
 

12833
03:39:11,120 --> 03:39:13,990
but it's an urgent problem
and we we need to fix it pretty sharpish

most likely challenge us
 

12867
03:39:48,239 --> 03:39:49,830
most likely challenge us
in the 21st century are the ones we

in the 21st century are the ones we
 

12869
03:39:49,840 --> 03:39:51,910
in the 21st century are the ones we
don't even expect people didn't expect

uh
 

12875
03:39:55,840 --> 03:39:57,110
uh
well

12876
03:39:57,110 --> 03:39:57,120
well
 

12877
03:39:57,120 --> 03:39:58,710
well
yeah not at the end of world war one but

12878
03:39:58,710 --> 03:39:58,720
yeah not at the end of world war one but
 

12879
03:39:58,720 --> 03:40:01,510
yeah not at the end of world war one but
by the 19 late 1920s i think people were

12880
03:40:01,510 --> 03:40:01,520
by the 19 late 1920s i think people were
 

12881

by the 19 late 1920s i think people were
beginning to worry about it yeah no

12882
03:40:03,349 --> 03:40:03,359
beginning to worry about it yeah no
 

12883
03:40:03,359 --> 03:40:05,269
beginning to worry about it yeah no
there's always people worrying about

12884
03:40:05,269 --> 03:40:05,279
there's always people worrying about
 

12885
03:40:05,279 --> 03:40:07,189
there's always people worrying about
everything yeah so if you focus on the

12886
03:40:07,189 --> 03:40:07,199
everything yeah so if you focus on the
 

12887
03:40:07,199 --> 03:40:09,429
everything yeah so if you focus on the
thing that people worry about yes

12888
03:40:09,429 --> 03:40:09,439
thing that people worry about yes
 

12889
03:40:09,439 --> 03:40:10,630
thing that people worry about yes
because there's a million things people

12890

because there's a million things people
 

12891
03:40:10,640 --> 03:40:12,349
because there's a million things people
worry about it and

03:40:12,349 --> 03:40:12,359
worry about it and
 

12893
03:40:12,359 --> 03:40:15,030
worry about it and
99.99 of them don't come to be of course

12894
03:40:15,030 --> 03:40:15,040
99.99 of them don't come to be of course
