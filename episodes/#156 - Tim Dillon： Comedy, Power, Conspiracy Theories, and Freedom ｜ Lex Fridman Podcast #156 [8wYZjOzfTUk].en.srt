00:18:27,360 --> 00:18:29,909
yeah and she goes a real knife fight out
here so we put that in the episode title

1136
00:18:29,909 --> 00:18:29,919
here so we put that in the episode title
 

1137
00:18:29,919 --> 00:18:31,510
here so we put that in the episode title
and of course i guess some algorithm

1138
00:18:31,510 --> 00:18:31,520
and of course i guess some algorithm
 

1139
00:18:31,520 --> 00:18:33,029
and of course i guess some algorithm
thought that we were showing like people

1140
00:18:33,029 --> 00:18:33,039
thought that we were showing like people
 

1141
00:18:33,039 --> 00:18:35,029
thought that we were showing like people
stabbing each other and wendy's

1142
00:18:35,029 --> 00:18:35,039
stabbing each other and wendy's
 

1143
00:18:35,039 --> 00:18:37,750
stabbing each other and wendy's
and we we got like demonetized did we

1144
00:18:37,750 --> 00:18:37,760
and we we got like demonetized did we
 

1145
00:18:37,760 --> 00:18:41,029
and we we got like demonetized did we
get demonetized

1146
00:18:41,029 --> 00:18:41,039

 

1147
00:18:41,039 --> 00:18:42,470

we lost a lot of views because we were

1148
00:18:42,470 --> 00:18:42,480
we lost a lot of views because we were
 

1149
00:18:42,480 --> 00:18:43,909
we lost a lot of views because we were
kicked out of whatever out like we're

1150
00:18:43,909 --> 00:18:43,919
kicked out of whatever out like we're
 

1151
00:18:43,919 --> 00:18:45,270
kicked out of whatever out like we're
just kicked out yeah and i was asking

1152
00:18:45,270 --> 00:18:45,280
just kicked out yeah and i was asking
 

1153
00:18:45,280 --> 00:18:46,150
just kicked out yeah and i was asking
youtube about it

1154
00:18:46,150 --> 00:18:46,160
youtube about it
 

1155
00:18:46,160 --> 00:18:47,590
youtube about it
they were kind of understanding it but

1156
00:18:47,590 --> 00:18:47,600
they were kind of understanding it but
 

1157
00:18:47,600 --> 00:18:49,190
they were kind of understanding it but
even the people that worked there

1158
00:18:49,190 --> 00:18:49,200
even the people that worked there
 

1159
00:18:49,200 --> 00:18:51,110
even the people that worked there
didn't truly seem to understand the

1160
00:18:51,110 --> 00:18:51,120
didn't truly seem to understand the
 

1161
00:18:51,120 --> 00:18:53,110
didn't truly seem to understand the
algorithm so can you explain to me how

1162
00:18:53,110 --> 00:18:53,120
algorithm so can you explain to me how
 

1163
00:18:53,120 --> 00:18:54,470
algorithm so can you explain to me how
that works where they barely know what's

1164
00:18:54,470 --> 00:18:54,480
that works where they barely know what's
 

1165
00:18:54,480 --> 00:18:55,190
that works where they barely know what's
going on

1166
00:18:55,190 --> 00:18:55,200
going on
 

1167
00:18:55,200 --> 00:18:57,510
going on
no they do not understand the full

1168
00:18:57,510 --> 00:18:57,520
no they do not understand the full
 

1169
00:18:57,520 --> 00:18:58,549
no they do not understand the full
dynamics of the

1170
00:18:58,549 --> 00:18:58,559
dynamics of the
 

1171
00:18:58,559 --> 00:19:00,549
dynamics of the
the monster or the amazing thing that

1172
00:19:00,549 --> 00:19:00,559
the monster or the amazing thing that
 

1173
00:19:00,559 --> 00:19:01,990
the monster or the amazing thing that
they've created it's

1174
00:19:01,990 --> 00:19:02,000
they've created it's
 

1175
00:19:02,000 --> 00:19:03,750
they've created it's
the amount of content that's being

1176
00:19:03,750 --> 00:19:03,760
the amount of content that's being
 

1177
00:19:03,760 --> 00:19:05,430
the amount of content that's being
created is larger than anyone

1178
00:19:05,430 --> 00:19:05,440
created is larger than anyone
 

1179
00:19:05,440 --> 00:19:06,230
created is larger than anyone
understands

1180
00:19:06,230 --> 00:19:06,240
understands
 

1181
00:19:06,240 --> 00:19:08,230
understands
like this is huge they can't deal with

1182
00:19:08,230 --> 00:19:08,240
like this is huge they can't deal with
 

1183
00:19:08,240 --> 00:19:09,830
like this is huge they can't deal with
it the teams aren't large enough to deal

1184
00:19:09,830 --> 00:19:09,840
it the teams aren't large enough to deal
 

1185
00:19:09,840 --> 00:19:10,870
it the teams aren't large enough to deal
with it

1186
00:19:10,870 --> 00:19:10,880
with it
 

1187
00:19:10,880 --> 00:19:13,430
with it
there's like special cases so if you

1188
00:19:13,430 --> 00:19:13,440
there's like special cases so if you
 

1189
00:19:13,440 --> 00:19:15,510
there's like special cases so if you
fall into the category a special case so

1190
00:19:15,510 --> 00:19:15,520
fall into the category a special case so
 

1191
00:19:15,520 --> 00:19:17,029
fall into the category a special case so
we can maybe talk about that like a

1192
00:19:17,029 --> 00:19:17,039
we can maybe talk about that like a
 

1193
00:19:17,039 --> 00:19:18,070
we can maybe talk about that like a
donald trump

1194
00:19:18,070 --> 00:19:18,080
donald trump
 

1195
00:19:18,080 --> 00:19:19,990
donald trump
where you like actually have meetings

1196
00:19:19,990 --> 00:19:20,000
where you like actually have meetings
 

1197
00:19:20,000 --> 00:19:21,510
where you like actually have meetings
about what to do with this particular

1198
00:19:21,510 --> 00:19:21,520
about what to do with this particular
 

1199
00:19:21,520 --> 00:19:22,070
about what to do with this particular
account

1200

account
 

1201
00:19:22,080 --> 00:19:23,750
account
but everything outside of that is all

1202
00:19:23,750 --> 00:19:23,760
but everything outside of that is all
 

1203
00:19:23,760 --> 00:19:25,510
but everything outside of that is all
algorithms they get uh

1204
00:19:25,510 --> 00:19:25,520
algorithms they get uh
 

1205
00:19:25,520 --> 00:19:28,630
algorithms they get uh
reported by people and they get uh

1206
00:19:28,630 --> 00:19:28,640
reported by people and they get uh
 

1207
00:19:28,640 --> 00:19:30,150
reported by people and they get uh
like if enough people report a

1208
00:19:30,150 --> 00:19:30,160
like if enough people report a
 

1209
00:19:30,160 --> 00:19:32,549
like if enough people report a
particular video a particular tweet

1210

particular video a particular tweet
 

1211
00:19:32,559 --> 00:19:35,669

it get it rises up to where humans look

1212
00:19:35,669 --> 00:19:35,679

is done by algorithm and they don't
understand the dynamics of that because

we're talking about billions of tweets

1228

we're talking about billions of tweets
 

1229
00:19:50,320 --> 00:19:52,470
we're talking about billions of tweets
we're talking about hundreds of

we're talking about hundreds of
 

1231
00:19:52,480 --> 00:19:53,430
we're talking about hundreds of
thousands

thousands
 

1233
00:19:53,440 --> 00:19:57,029
thousands
of hours of video uploaded

of hours of video uploaded
 

1235
00:19:57,039 --> 00:20:00,789
of hours of video uploaded
every day now the hilarity of it

1236
00:20:00,789 --> 00:20:00,799
every day now the hilarity of it
 

1237
00:20:00,799 --> 00:20:04,710
every day now the hilarity of it
is that most of the youtube algorithm

1238
00:20:04,710 --> 00:20:04,720
is that most of the youtube algorithm
 

1239
00:20:04,720 --> 00:20:08,230
is that most of the youtube algorithm
is based on the title

1240
00:20:08,230 --> 00:20:08,240
is based on the title
 

1241
00:20:08,240 --> 00:20:10,549
is based on the title
that's crazy it's and the description is

1242
00:20:10,549 --> 00:20:10,559
that's crazy it's and the description is
 

1243
00:20:10,559 --> 00:20:11,909
that's crazy it's and the description is
a small contribution in terms of

1244
00:20:11,909 --> 00:20:11,919
a small contribution in terms of
 

1245
00:20:11,919 --> 00:20:13,590
a small contribution in terms of
filtering in terms of the knife fight

1246
00:20:13,590 --> 00:20:13,600
filtering in terms of the knife fight
 

1247
00:20:13,600 --> 00:20:14,710
filtering in terms of the knife fight
situation right

1248
00:20:14,710 --> 00:20:14,720
situation right
 

1249
00:20:14,720 --> 00:20:16,950
situation right
and that's all they can do they cannot

1250
00:20:16,950 --> 00:20:16,960
and that's all they can do they cannot
 

1251
00:20:16,960 --> 00:20:17,750
and that's all they can do they cannot
they don't have

1252
00:20:17,750 --> 00:20:17,760
they don't have
 

1253
00:20:17,760 --> 00:20:20,470
they don't have
algorithms at all that are able to

1254
00:20:20,470 --> 00:20:20,480
algorithms at all that are able to
 

1255
00:20:20,480 --> 00:20:22,310
algorithms at all that are able to
process the content of the video

1256
00:20:22,310 --> 00:20:22,320
process the content of the video
 

1257
00:20:22,320 --> 00:20:25,350
process the content of the video
so they try to also infer

1258
00:20:25,350 --> 00:20:25,360
so they try to also infer
 

1259
00:20:25,360 --> 00:20:27,350
so they try to also infer
information based on if you're watching

1260
00:20:27,350 --> 00:20:27,360
information based on if you're watching
 

1261
00:20:27,360 --> 00:20:29,110
information based on if you're watching
all these like q and on videos or

1262
00:20:29,110 --> 00:20:29,120
all these like q and on videos or
 

1263
00:20:29,120 --> 00:20:30,070
all these like q and on videos or
something like that

1264
00:20:30,070 --> 00:20:30,080
something like that
 

1265
00:20:30,080 --> 00:20:34,230
something like that
or flat earth videos and you also watch

1266
00:20:34,230 --> 00:20:34,240
or flat earth videos and you also watch
 

1267
00:20:34,240 --> 00:20:35,990
or flat earth videos and you also watch
are really excitedly watching the whole

1268
00:20:35,990 --> 00:20:36,000
are really excitedly watching the whole
 

1269
00:20:36,000 --> 00:20:37,669
are really excitedly watching the whole
night fight in uh

1270
00:20:37,669 --> 00:20:37,679
night fight in uh
 

1271
00:20:37,679 --> 00:20:40,870
night fight in uh
malibu right video that says

1272
00:20:40,870 --> 00:20:40,880
malibu right video that says
 

1273
00:20:40,880 --> 00:20:42,789
malibu right video that says
that increases the chance that the knife

1274
00:20:42,789 --> 00:20:42,799
that increases the chance that the knife
 

1275
00:20:42,799 --> 00:20:44,070
that increases the chance that the knife
fight

1276
00:20:44,070 --> 00:20:44,080
fight
 

1277
00:20:44,080 --> 00:20:47,110
fight
uh is uh a dangerous video for society

1278
00:20:47,110 --> 00:20:47,120
uh is uh a dangerous video for society
 

1279
00:20:47,120 --> 00:20:48,390
uh is uh a dangerous video for society
or something interesting

1280
00:20:48,390 --> 00:20:48,400
or something interesting
 

1281
00:20:48,400 --> 00:20:50,310
or something interesting
wow based on their contribution people

1282
00:20:50,310 --> 00:20:50,320
wow based on their contribution people
 

1283
00:20:50,320 --> 00:20:51,990
wow based on their contribution people
are watching something

1284
00:20:51,990 --> 00:20:52,000
are watching something
 

1285
00:20:52,000 --> 00:20:53,909
are watching something
because i watch q and on and flat earth

1286
00:20:53,909 --> 00:20:53,919
because i watch q and on and flat earth
 

1287
00:20:53,919 --> 00:20:55,669
because i watch q and on and flat earth
videos to ridicule them

1288
00:20:55,669 --> 00:20:55,679
videos to ridicule them
 

1289
00:20:55,679 --> 00:20:57,350
videos to ridicule them
right that you know what i mean i watch

1290
00:20:57,350 --> 00:20:57,360
right that you know what i mean i watch
 

1291
00:20:57,360 --> 00:20:58,789
right that you know what i mean i watch
these videos and i make fun of them

1292
00:20:58,789 --> 00:20:58,799
these videos and i make fun of them
 

1293
00:20:58,799 --> 00:21:00,549
these videos and i make fun of them
on my show yeah but what's interesting

1294
00:21:00,549 --> 00:21:00,559
on my show yeah but what's interesting
 

1295
00:21:00,559 --> 00:21:01,990
on my show yeah but what's interesting
is if i then go watch

1296
00:21:01,990 --> 00:21:02,000

3071
00:48:48,319 --> 00:48:51,589
people are
angry just even acknowledging that

3072
00:48:51,589 --> 00:48:51,599
angry just even acknowledging that
 

3073
00:48:51,599 --> 00:48:53,190
angry just even acknowledging that
all the conspiracy theories that are out

3074
00:48:53,190 --> 00:48:53,200
all the conspiracy theories that are out
 

3075

there
 

3079
00:48:55,359 --> 00:48:57,270
there
and then people are thinking about it

3080
00:48:57,270 --> 00:48:57,280
and then people are thinking about it
 

3081
00:48:57,280 --> 00:48:59,589
and then people are thinking about it
and talking about it just

3082
00:48:59,589 --> 00:48:59,599
and talking about it just
 

3083
00:48:59,599 --> 00:49:01,510
and talking about it just
because otherwise so it's not

3084
00:49:01,510 --> 00:49:01,520
because otherwise so it's not
 

3085
00:49:01,520 --> 00:49:03,430
because otherwise so it's not
acknowledged in this nuanced way what

00:49:03,430 --> 00:49:03,440
acknowledged in this nuanced way what
 

3087

happens is you say okay 70 million
 

3089
00:49:05,440 --> 00:49:05,910
happens is you say okay 70 million
people

3090
00:49:05,910 --> 00:49:05,920

people
are white supremacists it's just

3092
00:49:08,390 --> 00:49:08,400

throwing

3094
00:49:09,030 --> 00:49:09,040
throwing
 

3095
00:49:09,040 --> 00:49:12,150
throwing
a kind of blanket statement

3096
00:49:12,150 --> 00:49:12,160
a kind of blanket statement
 

3097
00:49:12,160 --> 00:49:16,069
a kind of blanket statement
and of course that gets them angrier

3098
00:49:16,069 --> 00:49:16,079
and of course that gets them angrier
 

3099
00:49:16,079 --> 00:49:19,510
and of course that gets them angrier
and more makes them feel more powerless

3100
00:49:19,510 --> 00:49:19,520
and more makes them feel more powerless
 

3101
00:49:19,520 --> 00:49:23,030
and more makes them feel more powerless
and that ultimately that that's

3102
00:49:23,030 --> 00:49:23,040
and that ultimately that that's
 

3103
00:49:23,040 --> 00:49:25,430
and that ultimately that that's
what's been painful for me to see is

that
 

3107
00:49:26,559 --> 00:49:29,190
that
there's not an acknowledgement that most

correct different ways to obtain that

3752
00:59:17,030 --> 00:59:17,040
correct different ways to obtain that
 

3753
00:59:17,040 --> 00:59:18,470
correct different ways to obtain that
power and then you can use that to

3754
00:59:18,470 --> 00:59:18,480
power and then you can use that to
 

3755
00:59:18,480 --> 00:59:19,589
power and then you can use that to
leverage and

3756
00:59:19,589 --> 00:59:19,599
leverage and
 

3757
00:59:19,599 --> 00:59:21,510
leverage and
it probably doesn't have to be just in

01:07:00,160 --> 01:07:01,829
to me so i gotta keep doing that
part of part of the problem is that so

4258
01:07:01,829 --> 01:07:01,839
part of part of the problem is that so
 

4259
01:07:01,839 --> 01:07:03,109
part of part of the problem is that so
many of the lines are blurred right so

4260
01:07:03,109 --> 01:07:03,119
many of the lines are blurred right so
 

4261
01:07:03,119 --> 01:07:03,829
many of the lines are blurred right so
you have

4262
01:07:03,829 --> 01:07:03,839
you have
 

4263
01:07:03,839 --> 01:07:05,750
you have
comedians that are commentators and

4264
01:07:05,750 --> 01:07:05,760
comedians that are commentators and
 

4265
01:07:05,760 --> 01:07:07,270
comedians that are commentators and
commentators that are comedians and

4266
01:07:07,270 --> 01:07:07,280

4267
01:07:07,280 --> 01:07:08,230
commentators that are comedians and
politicians

4268
01:07:08,230 --> 01:07:08,240
politicians
 

4269
01:07:08,240 --> 01:07:09,750
politicians
so it's like it's harder to the defense

4270
01:07:09,750 --> 01:07:09,760
so it's like it's harder to the defense
 

4271
01:07:09,760 --> 01:07:10,870
so it's like it's harder to the defense
of like hey i'm a comedian leave me

4272
01:07:10,870 --> 01:07:10,880
of like hey i'm a comedian leave me

alone
 

4275
01:07:11,359 --> 01:07:13,109
alone
right that defense becomes harder when

4276
01:07:13,109 --> 01:07:13,119
right that defense becomes harder when
 

4277
01:07:13,119 --> 01:07:15,750
right that defense becomes harder when

decisions in 2020
 

8571
02:12:45,440 --> 02:12:47,510
decisions in 2020
because we're all locked up and stuck

8572
02:12:47,510 --> 02:12:47,520
because we're all locked up and stuck
 

8573
02:12:47,520 --> 02:12:48,870
because we're all locked up and stuck
with their own thoughts

8574

with their own thoughts
 

8575
02:12:48,880 --> 02:12:51,830
with their own thoughts
but so it's funny there's parallels

8576
02:12:51,830 --> 02:12:51,840
but so it's funny there's parallels
 

8577
02:12:51,840 --> 02:12:54,069
but so it's funny there's parallels
because i don't necessarily

8578
02:12:54,069 --> 02:12:54,079
because i don't necessarily
 

8579
02:12:54,079 --> 02:12:55,830
because i don't necessarily

8581
02:12:55,840 --> 02:12:57,510
you know i'm obviously a fan of comedy
but i don't care where

8582
02:12:57,510 --> 02:12:57,520
but i don't care where
 

8583
02:12:57,520 --> 02:13:00,149
but i don't care where
comics move sure but there's a parallel

8584
02:13:00,149 --> 02:13:00,159
