00:00:01,670 --> 00:00:01,680
it turns out that if you train a
 

3
00:00:01,680 --> 00:00:03,409
it turns out that if you train a
planarian and then cut their heads off

00:00:03,409 --> 00:00:03,419
planarian and then cut their heads off
 

5
00:00:03,419 --> 00:00:05,329
planarian and then cut their heads off
the tail will regenerate a brand new

00:00:05,329 --> 00:00:05,339
the tail will regenerate a brand new
 

7
00:00:05,339 --> 00:00:06,829
the tail will regenerate a brand new
brain that still remembers the original

8
00:00:06,829 --> 00:00:06,839
brain that still remembers the original

question of life for one thing they're
 

15
00:00:13,440 --> 00:00:15,110
question of life for one thing they're
similar to our ancestors so they have

16
00:00:15,110 --> 00:00:15,120
similar to our ancestors so they have
 

17
00:00:15,120 --> 00:00:16,430
similar to our ancestors so they have
true symmetry they have a true brain

18
00:00:16,430 --> 00:00:16,440

embryogenesis is the process of building

100
00:01:42,770 --> 00:01:42,780
embryogenesis is the process of building
 

101
00:01:42,780 --> 00:01:44,690
embryogenesis is the process of building
the human body from a single cell I

102
00:01:44,690 --> 00:01:44,700
the human body from a single cell I
 

103
00:01:44,700 --> 00:01:45,770
the human body from a single cell I
think it's one of the most incredible

104
00:01:45,770 --> 00:01:45,780
think it's one of the most incredible
 

105
00:01:45,780 --> 00:01:48,950
think it's one of the most incredible
things that exists on Earth from a

106
00:01:48,950 --> 00:01:48,960
things that exists on Earth from a
 

107
00:01:48,960 --> 00:01:50,929
things that exists on Earth from a
single embryo so how does this process

108
00:01:50,929 --> 00:01:50,939
single embryo so how does this process
 

109
00:01:50,939 --> 00:01:53,030
single embryo so how does this process
work yeah it is it is an incredible

110
00:01:53,030 --> 00:01:53,040
work yeah it is it is an incredible
 

111
00:01:53,040 --> 00:01:55,609
work yeah it is it is an incredible
process uh I think it's maybe the most

112
00:01:55,609 --> 00:01:55,619
process uh I think it's maybe the most
 

113
00:01:55,619 --> 00:01:58,670
process uh I think it's maybe the most
magical process there is and I think one

114
00:01:58,670 --> 00:01:58,680
magical process there is and I think one
 

115
00:01:58,680 --> 00:02:00,350
magical process there is and I think one
of the most fundamentally interesting

116
00:02:00,350 --> 00:02:00,360
of the most fundamentally interesting
 

117
00:02:00,360 --> 00:02:02,569
of the most fundamentally interesting
things about it is that it shows that

118
00:02:02,569 --> 00:02:02,579
things about it is that it shows that
 

119
00:02:02,579 --> 00:02:04,370
things about it is that it shows that
each of us takes the journey from

00:02:04,370 --> 00:02:04,380
each of us takes the journey from
 

121
00:02:04,380 --> 00:02:06,950
each of us takes the journey from
so-called just physics to mind right

122
00:02:06,950 --> 00:02:06,960
so-called just physics to mind right
 

123
00:02:06,960 --> 00:02:08,949
so-called just physics to mind right
because we all Start Life as a single

124
00:02:08,949 --> 00:02:08,959
because we all Start Life as a single

00:02:11,990 --> 00:02:12,000
quiescent unfertilized oocyte and it's
 

127
00:02:12,000 --> 00:02:13,430
quiescent unfertilized oocyte and it's
basically a bag of chemicals and you

128
00:02:13,430 --> 00:02:13,440
basically a bag of chemicals and you
 

129
00:02:13,440 --> 00:02:14,510
basically a bag of chemicals and you
look at that and you say okay this is

130
00:02:14,510 --> 00:02:14,520
look at that and you say okay this is
 

131
00:02:14,520 --> 00:02:16,430
look at that and you say okay this is
chemistry and physics and then nine

132
00:02:16,430 --> 00:02:16,440
chemistry and physics and then nine
 

133
00:02:16,440 --> 00:02:18,229
chemistry and physics and then nine
months and some years later you have an

134
00:02:18,229 --> 00:02:18,239
months and some years later you have an
 

135
00:02:18,239 --> 00:02:20,510
months and some years later you have an
organism with high level cognition and

136
00:02:20,510 --> 00:02:20,520
organism with high level cognition and
 

137
00:02:20,520 --> 00:02:23,089
organism with high level cognition and
preferences and an inner life and so on

138
00:02:23,089 --> 00:02:23,099
preferences and an inner life and so on
 

139
00:02:23,099 --> 00:02:25,790
preferences and an inner life and so on
and what embryogenesis tells us is that

140
00:02:25,790 --> 00:02:25,800
and what embryogenesis tells us is that
 

141
00:02:25,800 --> 00:02:27,530
and what embryogenesis tells us is that
that transformation from physics to mind

142
00:02:27,530 --> 00:02:27,540
that transformation from physics to mind
 

143
00:02:27,540 --> 00:02:30,110
that transformation from physics to mind
is gradual it's smooth there is no

144
00:02:30,110 --> 00:02:30,120
is gradual it's smooth there is no
 

145
00:02:30,120 --> 00:02:32,270
is gradual it's smooth there is no
special place where you know a lightning

146
00:02:32,270 --> 00:02:32,280

bolt says boom now you've gone from from

148
00:02:34,070 --> 00:02:34,080
bolt says boom now you've gone from from
 

149
00:02:34,080 --> 00:02:35,869
bolt says boom now you've gone from from
physics to True cognition that doesn't

150
00:02:35,869 --> 00:02:35,879
physics to True cognition that doesn't
 

151
00:02:35,879 --> 00:02:37,970
physics to True cognition that doesn't
happen and so we can see in this process

152
00:02:37,970 --> 00:02:37,980
happen and so we can see in this process
 

153
00:02:37,980 --> 00:02:39,530
happen and so we can see in this process
that the whole mystery you know the

154
00:02:39,530 --> 00:02:39,540
that the whole mystery you know the
 

155
00:02:39,540 --> 00:02:40,850
that the whole mystery you know the
biggest mystery of the you of the

156
00:02:40,850 --> 00:02:40,860
biggest mystery of the you of the
 

157
00:02:40,860 --> 00:02:42,710
biggest mystery of the you of the
universe basically how you get mind from

158
00:02:42,710 --> 00:02:42,720
universe basically how you get mind from
 

159
00:02:42,720 --> 00:02:46,130
universe basically how you get mind from
matter from just physics in quotes yeah

160
00:02:46,130 --> 00:02:46,140
matter from just physics in quotes yeah
 

161
00:02:46,140 --> 00:02:49,070
matter from just physics in quotes yeah
so where's the magic into the thing how

162
00:02:49,070 --> 00:02:49,080
so where's the magic into the thing how
 

163
00:02:49,080 --> 00:02:51,650
so where's the magic into the thing how
do we get from information encoded in

164
00:02:51,650 --> 00:02:51,660
do we get from information encoded in
 

165
00:02:51,660 --> 00:02:52,550
do we get from information encoded in
DNA

166
00:02:52,550 --> 00:02:52,560
DNA
 

167
00:02:52,560 --> 00:02:54,710
DNA
and make physical reality out of that

168
00:02:54,710 --> 00:02:54,720
and make physical reality out of that
 

169
00:02:54,720 --> 00:02:56,869
and make physical reality out of that
information so one of the things that I

170
00:02:56,869 --> 00:02:56,879
information so one of the things that I
 

171
00:02:56,879 --> 00:02:58,369
information so one of the things that I
think is really important if we're going

172
00:02:58,369 --> 00:02:58,379
think is really important if we're going
 

173
00:02:58,379 --> 00:03:00,650
think is really important if we're going
to bring in DNA into this picture is to

174
00:03:00,650 --> 00:03:00,660
to bring in DNA into this picture is to
 

175
00:03:00,660 --> 00:03:02,630
to bring in DNA into this picture is to
think about the fact that what DNA

176
00:03:02,630 --> 00:03:02,640
think about the fact that what DNA
 

177
00:03:02,640 --> 00:03:05,750
think about the fact that what DNA
encodes is the hardware of Life DNA

178
00:03:05,750 --> 00:03:05,760
encodes is the hardware of Life DNA
 

179
00:03:05,760 --> 00:03:07,430
encodes is the hardware of Life DNA
contains the instructions for the kind

180
00:03:07,430 --> 00:03:07,440
contains the instructions for the kind
 

181
00:03:07,440 --> 00:03:09,290
contains the instructions for the kind
of micro level Hardware that every cell

182
00:03:09,290 --> 00:03:09,300
of micro level Hardware that every cell
 

183
00:03:09,300 --> 00:03:10,729
of micro level Hardware that every cell
gets to play with so all the proteins

184
00:03:10,729 --> 00:03:10,739
gets to play with so all the proteins
 

185
00:03:10,739 --> 00:03:12,830
gets to play with so all the proteins
all the signaling factors the ion

186
00:03:12,830 --> 00:03:12,840
all the signaling factors the ion
 

187
00:03:12,840 --> 00:03:14,449
all the signaling factors the ion
channels all the cool little pieces of

188
00:03:14,449 --> 00:03:14,459
channels all the cool little pieces of
 

189
00:03:14,459 --> 00:03:15,649
channels all the cool little pieces of
Hardware that cells have that's what's

190
00:03:15,649 --> 00:03:15,659
Hardware that cells have that's what's
 

191
00:03:15,659 --> 00:03:18,710
Hardware that cells have that's what's
in the DNA the rest of it is in

192
00:03:18,710 --> 00:03:18,720
in the DNA the rest of it is in
 

193
00:03:18,720 --> 00:03:21,350
in the DNA the rest of it is in
so-called generic laws and these are

194
00:03:21,350 --> 00:03:21,360
so-called generic laws and these are
 

195
00:03:21,360 --> 00:03:23,149
so-called generic laws and these are
laws of mathematics these are laws of

196
00:03:23,149 --> 00:03:23,159
laws of mathematics these are laws of
 

197
00:03:23,159 --> 00:03:25,610
laws of mathematics these are laws of
computation these are laws of um of

198
00:03:25,610 --> 00:03:25,620
computation these are laws of um of
 

199
00:03:25,620 --> 00:03:27,410

physics of all all kinds of interesting

200
00:03:27,410 --> 00:03:27,420
physics of all all kinds of interesting
 

201
00:03:27,420 --> 00:03:29,690
physics of all all kinds of interesting
things that are not directly in the DNA

202
00:03:29,690 --> 00:03:29,700
things that are not directly in the DNA
 

203
00:03:29,700 --> 00:03:32,570
things that are not directly in the DNA
and that that process you know I think I

204
00:03:32,570 --> 00:03:32,580
and that that process you know I think I
 

205
00:03:32,580 --> 00:03:33,949
and that that process you know I think I
think the reason the reason I always put

206
00:03:33,949 --> 00:03:33,959
think the reason the reason I always put
 

207
00:03:33,959 --> 00:03:36,290
think the reason the reason I always put
just physics in quotes is because I

208
00:03:36,290 --> 00:03:36,300
just physics in quotes is because I
 

209
00:03:36,300 --> 00:03:37,309
just physics in quotes is because I
don't think there is such a thing as

210
00:03:37,309 --> 00:03:37,319
don't think there is such a thing as
 

211
00:03:37,319 --> 00:03:39,649
don't think there is such a thing as
just physics I think that thinking about

212
00:03:39,649 --> 00:03:39,659
just physics I think that thinking about
 

213
00:03:39,659 --> 00:03:41,390
just physics I think that thinking about
these things in binary categories like

214
00:03:41,390 --> 00:03:41,400
these things in binary categories like
 

215
00:03:41,400 --> 00:03:43,070
these things in binary categories like
this is physics this is true cognition

216
00:03:43,070 --> 00:03:43,080
this is physics this is true cognition
 

217
00:03:43,080 --> 00:03:44,930
this is physics this is true cognition
this is as if it's only faking other

218
00:03:44,930 --> 00:03:44,940
this is as if it's only faking other
 

219
00:03:44,940 --> 00:03:46,250
this is as if it's only faking other
these kinds of things I think that's

220
00:03:46,250 --> 00:03:46,260
these kinds of things I think that's
 

221
00:03:46,260 --> 00:03:48,050
these kinds of things I think that's
what gets us in trouble I think that we

222
00:03:48,050 --> 00:03:48,060
what gets us in trouble I think that we
 

223
00:03:48,060 --> 00:03:49,309
what gets us in trouble I think that we
really have to understand that it's a

224
00:03:49,309 --> 00:03:49,319
really have to understand that it's a
 

225
00:03:49,319 --> 00:03:50,990
really have to understand that it's a
Continuum and we have to work up the

226
00:03:50,990 --> 00:03:51,000
Continuum and we have to work up the
 

227
00:03:51,000 --> 00:03:52,490
Continuum and we have to work up the
scaling the laws of scaling and we can

228
00:03:52,490 --> 00:03:52,500
scaling the laws of scaling and we can
 

229
00:03:52,500 --> 00:03:53,809
scaling the laws of scaling and we can
and we can certainly talk about that

230
00:03:53,809 --> 00:03:53,819
and we can certainly talk about that
 

231
00:03:53,819 --> 00:03:55,130
and we can certainly talk about that
there's a lot of really interesting

232
00:03:55,130 --> 00:03:55,140
there's a lot of really interesting
 

233
00:03:55,140 --> 00:03:58,070
there's a lot of really interesting
thoughts to be had there so the physics

234
00:03:58,070 --> 00:03:58,080
thoughts to be had there so the physics
 

235
00:03:58,080 --> 00:04:01,009
thoughts to be had there so the physics
is deeply integrated with the

236
00:04:01,009 --> 00:04:01,019
is deeply integrated with the
 

237
00:04:01,019 --> 00:04:02,990
is deeply integrated with the
information so the DNA doesn't exist on

238
00:04:02,990 --> 00:04:03,000
information so the DNA doesn't exist on
 

239
00:04:03,000 --> 00:04:06,289
information so the DNA doesn't exist on
its own the DNA is a integrated as in

240
00:04:06,289 --> 00:04:06,299
its own the DNA is a integrated as in
 

241
00:04:06,299 --> 00:04:09,110
its own the DNA is a integrated as in
some sense in response to the the laws

242
00:04:09,110 --> 00:04:09,120
some sense in response to the the laws
 

243
00:04:09,120 --> 00:04:11,750
some sense in response to the the laws
of physics at every scale the laws

244
00:04:11,750 --> 00:04:11,760
of physics at every scale the laws
 

245
00:04:11,760 --> 00:04:14,690
of physics at every scale the laws
of the environment it exists in yeah the

246
00:04:14,690 --> 00:04:14,700
of the environment it exists in yeah the
 

247
00:04:14,700 --> 00:04:16,310
of the environment it exists in yeah the
environment and also the laws of the

248
00:04:16,310 --> 00:04:16,320
environment and also the laws of the
 

249
00:04:16,320 --> 00:04:17,390
environment and also the laws of the
Universe I mean the thing about the

250
00:04:17,390 --> 00:04:17,400
Universe I mean the thing about the
 

251
00:04:17,400 --> 00:04:19,670
Universe I mean the thing about the
thing about the the DNA is that it's um

252
00:04:19,670 --> 00:04:19,680
thing about the the DNA is that it's um
 

253
00:04:19,680 --> 00:04:22,370
thing about the the DNA is that it's um
once Evolution discovers a certain kind

254
00:04:22,370 --> 00:04:22,380
once Evolution discovers a certain kind
 

255
00:04:22,380 --> 00:04:24,770
once Evolution discovers a certain kind
of machine that if if the physical

256
00:04:24,770 --> 00:04:24,780
of machine that if if the physical
 

257
00:04:24,780 --> 00:04:26,689
of machine that if if the physical
implementation is appropriate it's sort

258
00:04:26,689 --> 00:04:26,699
implementation is appropriate it's sort
 

259
00:04:26,699 --> 00:04:28,610
implementation is appropriate it's sort
of uh and this is hard to talk about

260
00:04:28,610 --> 00:04:28,620
of uh and this is hard to talk about
 

261
00:04:28,620 --> 00:04:30,050
of uh and this is hard to talk about
because we don't have a good vocabulary

262
00:04:30,050 --> 00:04:30,060
because we don't have a good vocabulary
 

263
00:04:30,060 --> 00:04:32,330
because we don't have a good vocabulary
for this yet but it's a very kind of a

264
00:04:32,330 --> 00:04:32,340
for this yet but it's a very kind of a
 

265
00:04:32,340 --> 00:04:34,310
for this yet but it's a very kind of a
platonic notion that if the machine is

266
00:04:34,310 --> 00:04:34,320
platonic notion that if the machine is
 

267
00:04:34,320 --> 00:04:38,390
platonic notion that if the machine is
there it pulls down interesting uh

268
00:04:38,390 --> 00:04:38,400
there it pulls down interesting uh
 

269
00:04:38,400 --> 00:04:40,550
there it pulls down interesting uh
interesting things that you do not have

270
00:04:40,550 --> 00:04:40,560
interesting things that you do not have
 

271
00:04:40,560 --> 00:04:42,650
interesting things that you do not have
to evolve from scratch because the laws

272
00:04:42,650 --> 00:04:42,660
to evolve from scratch because the laws
 

273
00:04:42,660 --> 00:04:44,270
to evolve from scratch because the laws
of physics give it to you for free so

274
00:04:44,270 --> 00:04:44,280
of physics give it to you for free so
 

275
00:04:44,280 --> 00:04:46,249
of physics give it to you for free so
just as a really stupid example if

276
00:04:46,249 --> 00:04:46,259
just as a really stupid example if
 

277
00:04:46,259 --> 00:04:47,390
just as a really stupid example if
you're trying to evolve a particular

278
00:04:47,390 --> 00:04:47,400
you're trying to evolve a particular
 

279
00:04:47,400 --> 00:04:49,370
you're trying to evolve a particular
triangle you can evolve the first angle

280
00:04:49,370 --> 00:04:49,380
triangle you can evolve the first angle
 

281
00:04:49,380 --> 00:04:50,689
triangle you can evolve the first angle
and you evolve the second angle but you

282
00:04:50,689 --> 00:04:50,699
and you evolve the second angle but you
 

283
00:04:50,699 --> 00:04:52,010
and you evolve the second angle but you
don't need to evolve the third you know

284
00:04:52,010 --> 00:04:52,020
don't need to evolve the third you know
 

285
00:04:52,020 --> 00:04:53,689
don't need to evolve the third you know
what it is already now why do you know

286
00:04:53,689 --> 00:04:53,699
what it is already now why do you know
 

287
00:04:53,699 --> 00:04:54,950
what it is already now why do you know
that's that's a gift for free from

00:04:54,950 --> 00:04:54,960
that's that's a gift for free from
 

289
00:04:54,960 --> 00:04:56,510
that's that's a gift for free from
geometry in a particular space you know

00:04:56,510 --> 00:04:56,520
geometry in a particular space you know
 

291
00:04:56,520 --> 00:04:58,129
geometry in a particular space you know
what that angle has to be and if you

292
00:04:58,129 --> 00:04:58,139
what that angle has to be and if you
 

293
00:04:58,139 --> 00:04:59,990
what that angle has to be and if you
evolve an ion Channel which is Ion

294
00:04:59,990 --> 00:05:00,000
evolve an ion Channel which is Ion
 

295
00:05:00,000 --> 00:05:01,550
evolve an ion Channel which is Ion
channels are basically transistors right

296
00:05:01,550 --> 00:05:01,560
channels are basically transistors right
 

297
00:05:01,560 --> 00:05:02,810

they're voltage-gated current
 

299
00:05:02,820 --> 00:05:05,210
they're voltage-gated current
conductances if you evolve that ION

300
00:05:05,210 --> 00:05:05,220
conductances if you evolve that ION
 

301
00:05:05,220 --> 00:05:06,770
conductances if you evolve that ION
channel you immediately get to use

302
00:05:06,770 --> 00:05:06,780
channel you immediately get to use
 

303
00:05:06,780 --> 00:05:08,330
channel you immediately get to use
things like truth tables you get logic

304
00:05:08,330 --> 00:05:08,340
things like truth tables you get logic

the fact that if you have nand Gates you

314
00:05:16,249 --> 00:05:16,259
the fact that if you have nand Gates you
 

315
00:05:16,259 --> 00:05:17,450
the fact that if you have nand Gates you
can build anything you want you get that

for free all you have to evolve is that
 

319
00:05:19,500 --> 00:05:21,469
for free all you have to evolve is that
that first step a first little machine

320
00:05:21,469 --> 00:05:21,479
that first step a first little machine
 

321
00:05:21,479 --> 00:05:23,629
that first step a first little machine
that that enables you to couple to those

322
00:05:23,629 --> 00:05:23,639
that that enables you to couple to those
 

323
00:05:23,639 --> 00:05:25,430
that that enables you to couple to those
laws and there's laws of adhesion and

324
00:05:25,430 --> 00:05:25,440
laws and there's laws of adhesion and
 

325
00:05:25,440 --> 00:05:27,710
laws and there's laws of adhesion and
and many other things and this is all um

326
00:05:27,710 --> 00:05:27,720
and many other things and this is all um
 

327
00:05:27,720 --> 00:05:29,990
and many other things and this is all um
that interplay between the the hardware

328
00:05:29,990 --> 00:05:30,000
that interplay between the the hardware
 

329
00:05:30,000 --> 00:05:32,689
that interplay between the the hardware
that's set up by the genetics and the

330
00:05:32,689 --> 00:05:32,699
that's set up by the genetics and the
 

331
00:05:32,699 --> 00:05:34,070
that's set up by the genetics and the
software that's paid right the

332
00:05:34,070 --> 00:05:34,080
software that's paid right the
 

333
00:05:34,080 --> 00:05:35,749
software that's paid right the
physiological software that basically

334
00:05:35,749 --> 00:05:35,759
physiological software that basically
 

335
00:05:35,759 --> 00:05:37,550
physiological software that basically
does all the computation and the

336
00:05:37,550 --> 00:05:37,560
does all the computation and the
 

337
00:05:37,560 --> 00:05:39,590
does all the computation and the
cognition and everything else is a real

338
00:05:39,590 --> 00:05:39,600
cognition and everything else is a real
 

339
00:05:39,600 --> 00:05:41,510
cognition and everything else is a real
interplay between the information and

340
00:05:41,510 --> 00:05:41,520
interplay between the information and
 

341
00:05:41,520 --> 00:05:43,490
interplay between the information and
the DNA and the laws of physics of

342
00:05:43,490 --> 00:05:43,500
the DNA and the laws of physics of
 

343
00:05:43,500 --> 00:05:45,650
the DNA and the laws of physics of
computation and so on so is it fair to

344
00:05:45,650 --> 00:05:45,660
computation and so on so is it fair to
 

345
00:05:45,660 --> 00:05:48,050
computation and so on so is it fair to
say just like this idea that the laws of

346
00:05:48,050 --> 00:05:48,060
say just like this idea that the laws of
 

347
00:05:48,060 --> 00:05:50,450
say just like this idea that the laws of
mathematics are discovered

348
00:05:50,450 --> 00:05:50,460
mathematics are discovered
 

349
00:05:50,460 --> 00:05:53,090
mathematics are discovered
they're Laden within the fabric of the

350
00:05:53,090 --> 00:05:53,100
they're Laden within the fabric of the
 

351
00:05:53,100 --> 00:05:54,770
they're Laden within the fabric of the
universe in that same way the laws of

352
00:05:54,770 --> 00:05:54,780
universe in that same way the laws of
 

353
00:05:54,780 --> 00:05:56,990
universe in that same way the laws of
biology are kind of discovered yeah I

354
00:05:56,990 --> 00:05:57,000
biology are kind of discovered yeah I
 

355
00:05:57,000 --> 00:05:58,129
biology are kind of discovered yeah I
think that's absolutely and it's

356
00:05:58,129 --> 00:05:58,139
think that's absolutely and it's
 

357
00:05:58,139 --> 00:06:00,050
think that's absolutely and it's
probably not a popular view but I think

358
00:06:00,050 --> 00:06:00,060
probably not a popular view but I think
 

359
00:06:00,060 --> 00:06:01,610
probably not a popular view but I think
that's right on the money yeah well I

360
00:06:01,610 --> 00:06:01,620
that's right on the money yeah well I
 

361
00:06:01,620 --> 00:06:03,890
that's right on the money yeah well I
think that's a really deep idea

362
00:06:03,890 --> 00:06:03,900
think that's a really deep idea
 

363
00:06:03,900 --> 00:06:07,129
think that's a really deep idea
then embryogenesis is the process of

364
00:06:07,129 --> 00:06:07,139
then embryogenesis is the process of
 

365
00:06:07,139 --> 00:06:08,749
then embryogenesis is the process of
revealing

366
00:06:08,749 --> 00:06:08,759
revealing
 

367
00:06:08,759 --> 00:06:10,570
revealing
of um

368
00:06:10,570 --> 00:06:10,580
of um
 

369
00:06:10,580 --> 00:06:14,749
of um
embodying of manifesting these laws

370
00:06:14,749 --> 00:06:14,759
embodying of manifesting these laws
 

371
00:06:14,759 --> 00:06:18,370
embodying of manifesting these laws
you're not building the laws you're just

372
00:06:18,370 --> 00:06:18,380
you're not building the laws you're just
 

373
00:06:18,380 --> 00:06:21,770
you're not building the laws you're just
creating the capacity to reveal yes I

374
00:06:21,770 --> 00:06:21,780
creating the capacity to reveal yes I
 

375
00:06:21,780 --> 00:06:23,809
creating the capacity to reveal yes I
think again not the standard view of

376
00:06:23,809 --> 00:06:23,819
think again not the standard view of
 

377
00:06:23,819 --> 00:06:25,670
think again not the standard view of
molecular biology by any means but I

378
00:06:25,670 --> 00:06:25,680
molecular biology by any means but I
 

379
00:06:25,680 --> 00:06:26,809
molecular biology by any means but I
think that's right on the money I'll

380
00:06:26,809 --> 00:06:26,819
think that's right on the money I'll
 

381
00:06:26,819 --> 00:06:28,249
think that's right on the money I'll
give you a simple example you know some

382
00:06:28,249 --> 00:06:28,259
give you a simple example you know some
 

383
00:06:28,259 --> 00:06:29,629
give you a simple example you know some
of our latest work with these xenobots

384
00:06:29,629 --> 00:06:29,639
of our latest work with these xenobots
 

385
00:06:29,639 --> 00:06:31,670
of our latest work with these xenobots
right so what we've done is to take some

386
00:06:31,670 --> 00:06:31,680
right so what we've done is to take some
 

387
00:06:31,680 --> 00:06:33,529
right so what we've done is to take some
skin cells off of an early frog embryo

388
00:06:33,529 --> 00:06:33,539
skin cells off of an early frog embryo
 

389
00:06:33,539 --> 00:06:35,629
skin cells off of an early frog embryo
and basically ask about their plasticity

390
00:06:35,629 --> 00:06:35,639
and basically ask about their plasticity
 

391
00:06:35,639 --> 00:06:37,309
and basically ask about their plasticity
if we give you a chance to sort of

392
00:06:37,309 --> 00:06:37,319
if we give you a chance to sort of
 

393
00:06:37,319 --> 00:06:39,170
if we give you a chance to sort of
reboot your multicellularity in a

394
00:06:39,170 --> 00:06:39,180
reboot your multicellularity in a
 

395
00:06:39,180 --> 00:06:40,309
reboot your multicellularity in a
different context what would you do

396
00:06:40,309 --> 00:06:40,319
different context what would you do
 

397
00:06:40,319 --> 00:06:43,010
different context what would you do
because what you might assume by the

398
00:06:43,010 --> 00:06:43,020
because what you might assume by the
 

399
00:06:43,020 --> 00:06:44,570
because what you might assume by the
thing about embryogenesis is that it's

400
00:06:44,570 --> 00:06:44,580
thing about embryogenesis is that it's
 

401
00:06:44,580 --> 00:06:46,370
thing about embryogenesis is that it's
super reliable right it's very robust

402
00:06:46,370 --> 00:06:46,380
super reliable right it's very robust
 

403
00:06:46,380 --> 00:06:49,610
super reliable right it's very robust
and that really obscures some of its

404
00:06:49,610 --> 00:06:49,620
and that really obscures some of its
 

405
00:06:49,620 --> 00:06:51,170
and that really obscures some of its
most interesting features we get used to

406
00:06:51,170 --> 00:06:51,180
most interesting features we get used to
 

407
00:06:51,180 --> 00:06:52,790
most interesting features we get used to
it we get used to the fact that acorns

408
00:06:52,790 --> 00:06:52,800
it we get used to the fact that acorns
 

409
00:06:52,800 --> 00:06:54,890
it we get used to the fact that acorns
make oak trees and frog eggs make frogs

410
00:06:54,890 --> 00:06:54,900
make oak trees and frog eggs make frogs
 

411
00:06:54,900 --> 00:06:55,909
make oak trees and frog eggs make frogs
and we say well what else is it going to

412
00:06:55,909 --> 00:06:55,919
and we say well what else is it going to
 

413
00:06:55,919 --> 00:06:56,990
and we say well what else is it going to
make that's what it you know that's what

414
00:06:56,990 --> 00:06:57,000
make that's what it you know that's what
 

415
00:06:57,000 --> 00:06:59,809
make that's what it you know that's what
it makes that's a standard story but the

416
00:06:59,809 --> 00:06:59,819
it makes that's a standard story but the
 

417
00:06:59,819 --> 00:07:01,490
it makes that's a standard story but the
reality is and so and so you look at

418
00:07:01,490 --> 00:07:01,500
reality is and so and so you look at
 

419
00:07:01,500 --> 00:07:03,830
reality is and so and so you look at
these um these skin cells you say well

420
00:07:03,830 --> 00:07:03,840
these um these skin cells you say well
 

421
00:07:03,840 --> 00:07:04,969
these um these skin cells you say well
what do they know how to do well they

422
00:07:04,969 --> 00:07:04,979
what do they know how to do well they
 

423
00:07:04,979 --> 00:07:06,770
what do they know how to do well they
know how to be a passive boring

424
00:07:06,770 --> 00:07:06,780
know how to be a passive boring
 

425
00:07:06,780 --> 00:07:08,749
know how to be a passive boring
two-dimensional outer layer keeping the

426
00:07:08,749 --> 00:07:08,759
two-dimensional outer layer keeping the
 

427
00:07:08,759 --> 00:07:10,189
two-dimensional outer layer keeping the
bacteria from getting into the embryo

428
00:07:10,189 --> 00:07:10,199
bacteria from getting into the embryo
 

429
00:07:10,199 --> 00:07:11,510
bacteria from getting into the embryo
that's what they know how to do well it

430
00:07:11,510 --> 00:07:11,520
that's what they know how to do well it
 

431
00:07:11,520 --> 00:07:12,710
that's what they know how to do well it
turns out that if you take these skin

432
00:07:12,710 --> 00:07:12,720
turns out that if you take these skin
 

433
00:07:12,720 --> 00:07:15,590
turns out that if you take these skin
cells and you remove the rest of the

434
00:07:15,590 --> 00:07:15,600
cells and you remove the rest of the
 

435
00:07:15,600 --> 00:07:17,809
cells and you remove the rest of the
embryo so you remove all of the rest of

436
00:07:17,809 --> 00:07:17,819
embryo so you remove all of the rest of
 

437
00:07:17,819 --> 00:07:19,670
embryo so you remove all of the rest of
the cells and you say well you're by

438
00:07:19,670 --> 00:07:19,680
the cells and you say well you're by
 

439
00:07:19,680 --> 00:07:21,170
the cells and you say well you're by
yourself now what do you want to do so

440
00:07:21,170 --> 00:07:21,180
yourself now what do you want to do so
 

441
00:07:21,180 --> 00:07:23,270
yourself now what do you want to do so
what they do is they form this little um

442
00:07:23,270 --> 00:07:23,280
what they do is they form this little um
 

443
00:07:23,280 --> 00:07:25,550
what they do is they form this little um
this multi-little creature that runs

444
00:07:25,550 --> 00:07:25,560
this multi-little creature that runs
 

445
00:07:25,560 --> 00:07:26,629
this multi-little creature that runs
around the dish they have all kinds of

446
00:07:26,629 --> 00:07:26,639
around the dish they have all kinds of
 

447
00:07:26,639 --> 00:07:28,550
around the dish they have all kinds of
incredible capacities they navigate

448
00:07:28,550 --> 00:07:28,560
incredible capacities they navigate
 

449
00:07:28,560 --> 00:07:30,290
incredible capacities they navigate
through mazes they have various

450
00:07:30,290 --> 00:07:30,300
through mazes they have various
 

451
00:07:30,300 --> 00:07:31,249
through mazes they have various
behaviors that they do both

452
00:07:31,249 --> 00:07:31,259
behaviors that they do both
 

453
00:07:31,259 --> 00:07:34,370
behaviors that they do both
independently and and together they uh

454
00:07:34,370 --> 00:07:34,380
independently and and together they uh
 

455
00:07:34,380 --> 00:07:36,469
independently and and together they uh
they have a uh but they basically they

456
00:07:36,469 --> 00:07:36,479
they have a uh but they basically they
 

457
00:07:36,479 --> 00:07:37,909
they have a uh but they basically they
Implement Von Neumann's dream of

458
00:07:37,909 --> 00:07:37,919
Implement Von Neumann's dream of
 

459
00:07:37,919 --> 00:07:39,950
Implement Von Neumann's dream of
self-replication because if you sprinkle

460
00:07:39,950 --> 00:07:39,960
self-replication because if you sprinkle
 

461
00:07:39,960 --> 00:07:41,390
self-replication because if you sprinkle
a bunch of loose cells into the dish

462
00:07:41,390 --> 00:07:41,400
a bunch of loose cells into the dish
 

463
00:07:41,400 --> 00:07:42,890
a bunch of loose cells into the dish
what they do is they run around they

464
00:07:42,890 --> 00:07:42,900
what they do is they run around they
 

465
00:07:42,900 --> 00:07:44,450
what they do is they run around they
collect those cells into little piles

466
00:07:44,450 --> 00:07:44,460
collect those cells into little piles
 

467
00:07:44,460 --> 00:07:46,189
collect those cells into little piles
they they sort of mush them together

468
00:07:46,189 --> 00:07:46,199
they they sort of mush them together
 

469
00:07:46,199 --> 00:07:47,930
they they sort of mush them together
until those little piles become the next

470
00:07:47,930 --> 00:07:47,940
until those little piles become the next
 

471
00:07:47,940 --> 00:07:49,670
until those little piles become the next
generation of xenobots so you've got

472
00:07:49,670 --> 00:07:49,680
generation of xenobots so you've got
 

473
00:07:49,680 --> 00:07:51,170
generation of xenobots so you've got

00:07:57,300 --> 00:07:59,029
things that you would have expected from
the Frog genome in fact there's wild

482
00:07:59,029 --> 00:07:59,039
the Frog genome in fact there's wild
 

483
00:07:59,039 --> 00:08:00,230
the Frog genome in fact there's wild
type the genome was wild type there's

484
00:08:00,230 --> 00:08:00,240
type the genome was wild type there's
 

485
00:08:00,240 --> 00:08:01,249
type the genome was wild type there's
nothing wrong with their genetics

486
00:08:01,249 --> 00:08:01,259
nothing wrong with their genetics
 

487
00:08:01,259 --> 00:08:03,290
nothing wrong with their genetics
nothing has been added no Nano materials

488
00:08:03,290 --> 00:08:03,300
nothing has been added no Nano materials
 

489
00:08:03,300 --> 00:08:06,110
nothing has been added no Nano materials
no genomic editing nothing and so what

490
00:08:06,110 --> 00:08:06,120
no genomic editing nothing and so what
 

491
00:08:06,120 --> 00:08:08,089
no genomic editing nothing and so what
we have done there is engineer by

492
00:08:08,089 --> 00:08:08,099
we have done there is engineer by
 

493
00:08:08,099 --> 00:08:10,010
we have done there is engineer by
subtraction which you've done is you've

494
00:08:10,010 --> 00:08:10,020
subtraction which you've done is you've
 

495
00:08:10,020 --> 00:08:12,110
subtraction which you've done is you've
removed the other cells that normally

496
00:08:12,110 --> 00:08:12,120
removed the other cells that normally
 

497
00:08:12,120 --> 00:08:13,730
removed the other cells that normally
basically bully these cells into being

498
00:08:13,730 --> 00:08:13,740
basically bully these cells into being
 

499
00:08:13,740 --> 00:08:16,010
basically bully these cells into being
skin cells and you find out that what

500
00:08:16,010 --> 00:08:16,020
skin cells and you find out that what
 

501
00:08:16,020 --> 00:08:18,170
skin cells and you find out that what
they really want to do is is to be this

502
00:08:18,170 --> 00:08:18,180
they really want to do is is to be this
 

503
00:08:18,180 --> 00:08:20,330
they really want to do is is to be this
they want their default behaviors to be

504
00:08:20,330 --> 00:08:20,340
they want their default behaviors to be
 

505
00:08:20,340 --> 00:08:22,969
they want their default behaviors to be
a xenobot but in Vivo in the embryo they

506
00:08:22,969 --> 00:08:22,979
a xenobot but in Vivo in the embryo they
 

507
00:08:22,979 --> 00:08:24,890
a xenobot but in Vivo in the embryo they
get told to be skinned by these other

508
00:08:24,890 --> 00:08:24,900
get told to be skinned by these other
 

509
00:08:24,900 --> 00:08:27,529
get told to be skinned by these other
cell types and so so now so now here

510
00:08:27,529 --> 00:08:27,539
cell types and so so now so now here
 

511
00:08:27,539 --> 00:08:29,270
cell types and so so now so now here
comes this this really interesting

00:08:29,270 --> 00:08:29,280
comes this this really interesting
 

513
00:08:29,280 --> 00:08:30,950
comes this this really interesting
question that you just posed

514
00:08:30,950 --> 00:08:30,960
question that you just posed
 

515
00:08:30,960 --> 00:08:33,529
question that you just posed
when you ask where does the form of the

516
00:08:33,529 --> 00:08:33,539
when you ask where does the form of the
 

517
00:08:33,539 --> 00:08:35,089
when you ask where does the form of the
tadpole and the Frog come from the

00:08:35,089 --> 00:08:35,099
tadpole and the Frog come from the
 

519
00:08:35,099 --> 00:08:37,909
tadpole and the Frog come from the
standard answer as well it's it's it's a

520
00:08:37,909 --> 00:08:37,919
standard answer as well it's it's it's a
 

521
00:08:37,919 --> 00:08:39,769
standard answer as well it's it's it's a
selection so over over millions of years

522
00:08:39,769 --> 00:08:39,779
selection so over over millions of years
 

523
00:08:39,779 --> 00:08:41,810

what are xenobots
 

559
00:09:12,240 --> 00:09:14,690
what are xenobots
so a xenobod is uh self-assembling

560
00:09:14,690 --> 00:09:14,700
so a xenobod is uh self-assembling
 

561
00:09:14,700 --> 00:09:17,090
so a xenobod is uh self-assembling
little proto-organism it's also a

637
00:10:35,700 --> 00:10:38,329
some sense many of the organisms within
our body are kinds of robots yes yes and

638
00:10:38,329 --> 00:10:38,339
our body are kinds of robots yes yes and
 

639
00:10:38,339 --> 00:10:40,610
our body are kinds of robots yes yes and
I think robots is a weird line because

640
00:10:40,610 --> 00:10:40,620
I think robots is a weird line because
 

641
00:10:40,620 --> 00:10:44,030
I think robots is a weird line because
it's we tend to see robots as the other

642
00:10:44,030 --> 00:10:44,040
it's we tend to see robots as the other
 

643
00:10:44,040 --> 00:10:45,710
it's we tend to see robots as the other
I think there will be a time in the

644
00:10:45,710 --> 00:10:45,720
I think there will be a time in the
 

645
00:10:45,720 --> 00:10:47,569
I think there will be a time in the
future when there's going to be

646
00:10:47,569 --> 00:10:47,579
future when there's going to be
 

647
00:10:47,579 --> 00:10:49,490
future when there's going to be
something akin to the Civil Rights

648
00:10:49,490 --> 00:10:49,500
something akin to the Civil Rights
 

649
00:10:49,500 --> 00:10:51,290
something akin to the Civil Rights
movements for robots but we'll talk

650
00:10:51,290 --> 00:10:51,300
movements for robots but we'll talk
 

651
00:10:51,300 --> 00:10:53,690
movements for robots but we'll talk
about that later perhaps sure anyway

652
00:10:53,690 --> 00:10:53,700
about that later perhaps sure anyway
 

653
00:10:53,700 --> 00:10:54,710
about that later perhaps sure anyway
um

654
00:10:54,710 --> 00:10:54,720
um
 

655
00:10:54,720 --> 00:10:57,829
um
so how do you can we just Linger on it

656
00:10:57,829 --> 00:10:57,839
so how do you can we just Linger on it
 

657
00:10:57,839 --> 00:10:59,990
so how do you can we just Linger on it
how do you build a zenobot what are we

658
00:10:59,990 --> 00:11:00,000
how do you build a zenobot what are we
 

659
00:11:00,000 --> 00:11:01,550
how do you build a zenobot what are we
talking about here

660
00:11:01,550 --> 00:11:01,560
talking about here
 

661
00:11:01,560 --> 00:11:05,750
talking about here
from from whence does it start and how

662
00:11:05,750 --> 00:11:05,760
from from whence does it start and how
 

663
00:11:05,760 --> 00:11:07,130
from from whence does it start and how
does it become

664
00:11:07,130 --> 00:11:07,140
does it become
 

665
00:11:07,140 --> 00:11:10,250
does it become
the Glorious zenobot yeah so just to

666
00:11:10,250 --> 00:11:10,260
the Glorious zenobot yeah so just to
 

667
00:11:10,260 --> 00:11:12,050
the Glorious zenobot yeah so just to
take one step back one of the things

668
00:11:12,050 --> 00:11:12,060
take one step back one of the things
 

669
00:11:12,060 --> 00:11:14,389
take one step back one of the things
that a lot of people uh get stuck on is

670
00:11:14,389 --> 00:11:14,399
that a lot of people uh get stuck on is
 

671
00:11:14,399 --> 00:11:16,850
that a lot of people uh get stuck on is
they say well uh you know engineering

672
00:11:16,850 --> 00:11:16,860
they say well uh you know engineering
 

673
00:11:16,860 --> 00:11:20,569
they say well uh you know engineering
requires new DNA circuits or it requires

674
00:11:20,569 --> 00:11:20,579
requires new DNA circuits or it requires
 

675
00:11:20,579 --> 00:11:22,430
requires new DNA circuits or it requires
new nanomaterials you know what the

676
00:11:22,430 --> 00:11:22,440
new nanomaterials you know what the
 

677
00:11:22,440 --> 00:11:25,490
new nanomaterials you know what the
thing is we are now moving from Old

678
00:11:25,490 --> 00:11:25,500
thing is we are now moving from Old
 

679
00:11:25,500 --> 00:11:27,050
thing is we are now moving from Old
School engineering which use passive

680
00:11:27,050 --> 00:11:27,060
School engineering which use passive
 

681
00:11:27,060 --> 00:11:28,790
School engineering which use passive
materials right that things like you

682
00:11:28,790 --> 00:11:28,800
materials right that things like you
 

683
00:11:28,800 --> 00:11:30,110
materials right that things like you
know wood metal things like this that

684
00:11:30,110 --> 00:11:30,120
know wood metal things like this that
 

685
00:11:30,120 --> 00:11:31,250
know wood metal things like this that
basically the only thing you could

686
00:11:31,250 --> 00:11:31,260
basically the only thing you could
 

687
00:11:31,260 --> 00:11:32,389
basically the only thing you could
depend on is that they were going to

688
00:11:32,389 --> 00:11:32,399
depend on is that they were going to
 

689
00:11:32,399 --> 00:11:33,710
depend on is that they were going to
keep their shape that's it they don't do

690
00:11:33,710 --> 00:11:33,720
keep their shape that's it they don't do
 

691
00:11:33,720 --> 00:11:35,630
keep their shape that's it they don't do
anything else you it's on you as an

692
00:11:35,630 --> 00:11:35,640
anything else you it's on you as an
 

693
00:11:35,640 --> 00:11:36,949
anything else you it's on you as an
engineer to make them do everything

694
00:11:36,949 --> 00:11:36,959
engineer to make them do everything
 

695
00:11:36,959 --> 00:11:38,150
engineer to make them do everything
they're going to do and then there were

696
00:11:38,150 --> 00:11:38,160
they're going to do and then there were
 

697
00:11:38,160 --> 00:11:40,610
they're going to do and then there were
active materials and now computationals

698
00:11:40,610 --> 00:11:40,620
active materials and now computationals
 

699
00:11:40,620 --> 00:11:41,870
active materials and now computationals
this is a whole new era these are

700
00:11:41,870 --> 00:11:41,880
this is a whole new era these are
 

701
00:11:41,880 --> 00:11:44,030
this is a whole new era these are
agential materials this is your you're

702
00:11:44,030 --> 00:11:44,040
agential materials this is your you're
 

703
00:11:44,040 --> 00:11:45,590
agential materials this is your you're
now collaborating with your substrate

704
00:11:45,590 --> 00:11:45,600
now collaborating with your substrate
 

705
00:11:45,600 --> 00:11:47,210
now collaborating with your substrate
because your material has an agenda

706
00:11:47,210 --> 00:11:47,220
because your material has an agenda
 

707
00:11:47,220 --> 00:11:49,310
because your material has an agenda
these cells have you know billions of

708
00:11:49,310 --> 00:11:49,320
these cells have you know billions of
 

709
00:11:49,320 --> 00:11:50,690
these cells have you know billions of
years of evolution they have goals they

710
00:11:50,690 --> 00:11:50,700
years of evolution they have goals they
 

711
00:11:50,700 --> 00:11:52,069
years of evolution they have goals they
have preferences they're not just going

712
00:11:52,069 --> 00:11:52,079
have preferences they're not just going
 

713
00:11:52,079 --> 00:11:53,210
have preferences they're not just going
to sit where you put them that's

714
00:11:53,210 --> 00:11:53,220
to sit where you put them that's
 

715
00:11:53,220 --> 00:11:55,310
to sit where you put them that's
hilarious that you have to talk your

716
00:11:55,310 --> 00:11:55,320
hilarious that you have to talk your
 

717
00:11:55,320 --> 00:11:57,050
hilarious that you have to talk your
material and to keep your kitchen that's

718
00:11:57,050 --> 00:11:57,060
material and to keep your kitchen that's
 

719
00:11:57,060 --> 00:11:59,090
material and to keep your kitchen that's
it that is exactly right that is exactly

720
00:11:59,090 --> 00:11:59,100
it that is exactly right that is exactly
 

721
00:11:59,100 --> 00:12:01,190
it that is exactly right that is exactly
right stay there it's like getting a

722
00:12:01,190 --> 00:12:01,200
right stay there it's like getting a
 

723
00:12:01,200 --> 00:12:03,829
right stay there it's like getting a
bunch of cats or something and trying to

724
00:12:03,829 --> 00:12:03,839
bunch of cats or something and trying to
 

725
00:12:03,839 --> 00:12:05,269
bunch of cats or something and trying to
organize the shape out of them it's

726
00:12:05,269 --> 00:12:05,279
organize the shape out of them it's
 

727
00:12:05,279 --> 00:12:06,350
organize the shape out of them it's
funny we're on the same page here

728
00:12:06,350 --> 00:12:06,360
funny we're on the same page here
 

729
00:12:06,360 --> 00:12:07,970
funny we're on the same page here
because in a paper this is this is

730
00:12:07,970 --> 00:12:07,980
because in a paper this is this is
 

731
00:12:07,980 --> 00:12:09,769
because in a paper this is this is
currently um just been accepted in

I have is building a tower out of Legos

736
00:12:13,850 --> 00:12:13,860
I have is building a tower out of Legos
 

737
00:12:13,860 --> 00:12:15,590
I have is building a tower out of Legos
versus dogs right yeah so think about

738
00:12:15,590 --> 00:12:15,600
versus dogs right yeah so think about
 

739
00:12:15,600 --> 00:12:16,790
versus dogs right yeah so think about
the difference right if you build out of

740
00:12:16,790 --> 00:12:16,800
the difference right if you build out of
 

741
00:12:16,800 --> 00:12:19,490
the difference right if you build out of
Legos you have full control over where

742
00:12:19,490 --> 00:12:19,500
Legos you have full control over where
 

743
00:12:19,500 --> 00:12:21,530
Legos you have full control over where
it's going to go but if somebody knocks

744
00:12:21,530 --> 00:12:21,540
it's going to go but if somebody knocks
 

745
00:12:21,540 --> 00:12:23,990
it's going to go but if somebody knocks
it over it's game over with the dogs you

746
00:12:23,990 --> 00:12:24,000
it over it's game over with the dogs you
 

747
00:12:24,000 --> 00:12:25,430
it over it's game over with the dogs you
cannot just come and stack them they're

748
00:12:25,430 --> 00:12:25,440
cannot just come and stack them they're
 

749
00:12:25,440 --> 00:12:26,690
cannot just come and stack them they're
not going to stay that way but the good

750
00:12:26,690 --> 00:12:26,700
not going to stay that way but the good
 

751
00:12:26,700 --> 00:12:28,430
not going to stay that way but the good
news is that if you train them then

752
00:12:28,430 --> 00:12:28,440
news is that if you train them then
 

753
00:12:28,440 --> 00:12:29,509
news is that if you train them then
somebody knocks it over they'll get

754
00:12:29,509 --> 00:12:29,519
somebody knocks it over they'll get
 

755
00:12:29,519 --> 00:12:31,610
somebody knocks it over they'll get
right back up so it's all right so as an

756
00:12:31,610 --> 00:12:31,620
right back up so it's all right so as an
 

757
00:12:31,620 --> 00:12:33,170
right back up so it's all right so as an
engineer what you really want to know is

758
00:12:33,170 --> 00:12:33,180
engineer what you really want to know is
 

759
00:12:33,180 --> 00:12:34,730
engineer what you really want to know is
what can they depend on this thing to do

760
00:12:34,730 --> 00:12:34,740
what can they depend on this thing to do
 

761
00:12:34,740 --> 00:12:36,290
what can they depend on this thing to do
right that's really you know a lot of

762
00:12:36,290 --> 00:12:36,300
right that's really you know a lot of
 

763
00:12:36,300 --> 00:12:37,970
right that's really you know a lot of
people have definitions of robots as far

764
00:12:37,970 --> 00:12:37,980
people have definitions of robots as far
 

765
00:12:37,980 --> 00:12:39,710
people have definitions of robots as far
as what they're made of or how they got

766
00:12:39,710 --> 00:12:39,720
as what they're made of or how they got
 

767
00:12:39,720 --> 00:12:41,150
as what they're made of or how they got
here you know design versus evolve

768
00:12:41,150 --> 00:12:41,160
here you know design versus evolve
 

769
00:12:41,160 --> 00:12:42,410
here you know design versus evolve
whatever I don't think any of that is

770
00:12:42,410 --> 00:12:42,420
whatever I don't think any of that is
 

771
00:12:42,420 --> 00:12:44,150
whatever I don't think any of that is
useful I think I think as an engineer

772
00:12:44,150 --> 00:12:44,160
useful I think I think as an engineer
 

773
00:12:44,160 --> 00:12:46,550
useful I think I think as an engineer
what you want to know is how much can I

774
00:12:46,550 --> 00:12:46,560
what you want to know is how much can I
 

775
00:12:46,560 --> 00:12:48,410
what you want to know is how much can I
depend on this thing to do when I'm not

776
00:12:48,410 --> 00:12:48,420
depend on this thing to do when I'm not
 

777
00:12:48,420 --> 00:12:50,269
depend on this thing to do when I'm not
around to micromanage it what level of

778
00:12:50,269 --> 00:12:50,279
around to micromanage it what level of
 

779
00:12:50,279 --> 00:12:52,910
around to micromanage it what level of
uh what level of dependency can I can I

780
00:12:52,910 --> 00:12:52,920
uh what level of dependency can I can I
 

781
00:12:52,920 --> 00:12:54,350
uh what level of dependency can I can I
give this thing how much agency does it

782
00:12:54,350 --> 00:12:54,360
give this thing how much agency does it
 

783
00:12:54,360 --> 00:12:55,670
give this thing how much agency does it
have which then tells you what

784
00:12:55,670 --> 00:12:55,680
have which then tells you what
 

785
00:12:55,680 --> 00:12:56,930
have which then tells you what
techniques do you use so do you use

786
00:12:56,930 --> 00:12:56,940
techniques do you use so do you use
 

787
00:12:56,940 --> 00:12:58,190
techniques do you use so do you use
micromanagement like you put everything

788
00:12:58,190 --> 00:12:58,200
micromanagement like you put everything
 

789
00:12:58,200 --> 00:13:00,410
micromanagement like you put everything
where it goes do you train it do you

790
00:13:00,410 --> 00:13:00,420
where it goes do you train it do you
 

791
00:13:00,420 --> 00:13:01,910
where it goes do you train it do you
give it signals do you try to convince

792
00:13:01,910 --> 00:13:01,920
give it signals do you try to convince

00:13:14,090 --> 00:13:14,100
old style what's the word you're using a
 

807
00:13:14,100 --> 00:13:16,250
old style what's the word you're using a
gentle a gentle what's that mean agency

gentle a gentle what's that mean agency
 

809
00:13:16,260 --> 00:13:17,810
gentle a gentle what's that mean agency
if it comes from the word agency so so

810
00:13:17,810 --> 00:13:17,820
if it comes from the word agency so so
 

811
00:13:17,820 --> 00:13:19,190
if it comes from the word agency so so
basically the material has agency

812
00:13:19,190 --> 00:13:19,200
basically the material has agency
 

813
00:13:19,200 --> 00:13:22,069
basically the material has agency
meaning that it has some some level of

00:14:04,310 --> 00:14:04,320
in regenerative medicine require us to
 

855
00:14:04,320 --> 00:14:05,690
in regenerative medicine require us to
take advantage of this because what it

856
00:14:05,690 --> 00:14:05,700
take advantage of this because what it
 

857
00:14:05,700 --> 00:14:08,269
take advantage of this because what it
means is that you can get the material

858
00:14:08,269 --> 00:14:08,279
means is that you can get the material
 

859
00:14:08,279 --> 00:14:09,949
means is that you can get the material
to do things that you don't know how to

860
00:14:09,949 --> 00:14:09,959
to do things that you don't know how to
 

861
00:14:09,959 --> 00:14:11,990
to do things that you don't know how to
micromanage so just as a simple example

right if you if you you had a rat and uh
 

865
00:14:14,700 --> 00:14:16,910
right if you if you you had a rat and uh
you wanted this rat to do a circus trick

it the micromanagement way which is try
 

871
00:14:20,880 --> 00:14:22,370
it the micromanagement way which is try

an arm you did it before do it again so
 

925
00:15:11,820 --> 00:15:13,550
an arm you did it before do it again so
that's I I think it's it's both it's

00:15:13,550 --> 00:15:13,560
that's I I think it's it's both it's

that's I I think it's it's both it's
both the difficult and it challenges us

both the difficult and it challenges us

both the difficult and it challenges us
to develop new ways of engineering and

to develop new ways of engineering and
it's it's hugely empowering okay so how

932
00:15:19,970 --> 00:15:19,980
it's it's hugely empowering okay so how
 

933
00:15:19,980 --> 00:15:22,069
it's it's hugely empowering okay so how
do you do I mean maybe sticking with the

00:15:22,069 --> 00:15:22,079
do you do I mean maybe sticking with the

00:15:22,079 --> 00:15:24,949
do you do I mean maybe sticking with the

I presume you have to figure out the

I presume you have to figure out the

00:15:27,600 --> 00:15:33,230
I presume you have to figure out the
find the dogs and uh dispose of the cats

940
00:15:33,230 --> 00:15:33,240
find the dogs and uh dispose of the cats
 

941
00:15:33,240 --> 00:15:35,509
find the dogs and uh dispose of the cats
um because you know it's like the old

942
00:15:35,509 --> 00:15:35,519
um because you know it's like the old
 

943
00:15:35,519 --> 00:15:38,329
um because you know it's like the old
herding cats is an issue so you may be

944
00:15:38,329 --> 00:15:38,339
herding cats is an issue so you may be
 

945
00:15:38,339 --> 00:15:39,889
herding cats is an issue so you may be
able to train dogs

946
00:15:39,889 --> 00:15:39,899
able to train dogs
 

947
00:15:39,899 --> 00:15:41,990
able to train dogs
I suspect you will not be able to train

948
00:15:41,990 --> 00:15:42,000
I suspect you will not be able to train
 

949
00:15:42,000 --> 00:15:43,069
I suspect you will not be able to train
cats

950
00:15:43,069 --> 00:15:43,079
cats
 

951
00:15:43,079 --> 00:15:45,110
cats
or if you do you're never going to be

952
00:15:45,110 --> 00:15:45,120
or if you do you're never going to be
 

953
00:15:45,120 --> 00:15:47,810
or if you do you're never going to be
able to trust them so is there a way to

954
00:15:47,810 --> 00:15:47,820
able to trust them so is there a way to
 

955
00:15:47,820 --> 00:15:51,110
able to trust them so is there a way to
figure out which material is amenable

956
00:15:51,110 --> 00:15:51,120
figure out which material is amenable
 

957
00:15:51,120 --> 00:15:54,650
figure out which material is amenable
to hurting is it in the lab work or is

958
00:15:54,650 --> 00:15:54,660
to hurting is it in the lab work or is
 

959
00:15:54,660 --> 00:15:57,170
to hurting is it in the lab work or is
it in simulation right now it's largely

960
00:15:57,170 --> 00:15:57,180
it in simulation right now it's largely
 

961
00:15:57,180 --> 00:15:58,850
it in simulation right now it's largely
in the lab because we are our

962
00:15:58,850 --> 00:15:58,860
in the lab because we are our
 

963
00:15:58,860 --> 00:16:01,610
in the lab because we are our
simulations do not capture yet the most

964
00:16:01,610 --> 00:16:01,620
simulations do not capture yet the most
 

965
00:16:01,620 --> 00:16:03,530
simulations do not capture yet the most
uh interesting and Powerful things about

966
00:16:03,530 --> 00:16:03,540
uh interesting and Powerful things about
 

967
00:16:03,540 --> 00:16:05,509
uh interesting and Powerful things about
biology so the simulation what what

968
00:16:05,509 --> 00:16:05,519
biology so the simulation what what
 

969
00:16:05,519 --> 00:16:08,689
biology so the simulation what what
we're pretty good at simulating are feed

970
00:16:08,689 --> 00:16:08,699
we're pretty good at simulating are feed
 

971
00:16:08,699 --> 00:16:10,850
we're pretty good at simulating are feed
forward emergent types of things right

972
00:16:10,850 --> 00:16:10,860
forward emergent types of things right
 

973
00:16:10,860 --> 00:16:12,650
forward emergent types of things right
so cellular automata if you have simple

974
00:16:12,650 --> 00:16:12,660
so cellular automata if you have simple
 

975
00:16:12,660 --> 00:16:14,990
so cellular automata if you have simple
rules and you sort of roll those forward

976
00:16:14,990 --> 00:16:15,000
rules and you sort of roll those forward
 

977
00:16:15,000 --> 00:16:17,210
rules and you sort of roll those forward
for every every agent or every cell in

978
00:16:17,210 --> 00:16:17,220
for every every agent or every cell in
 

979
00:16:17,220 --> 00:16:18,470
for every every agent or every cell in
the simulation then complex things

980
00:16:18,470 --> 00:16:18,480
the simulation then complex things
 

981
00:16:18,480 --> 00:16:20,509
the simulation then complex things
happen you know ant colony or algorithms

982
00:16:20,509 --> 00:16:20,519
happen you know ant colony or algorithms
 

983
00:16:20,519 --> 00:16:22,129
happen you know ant colony or algorithms
things like that we're we're good at

984
00:16:22,129 --> 00:16:22,139
things like that we're we're good at
 

985
00:16:22,139 --> 00:16:23,210
things like that we're we're good at
that and that's and that's fine the

986
00:16:23,210 --> 00:16:23,220
that and that's and that's fine the
 

987
00:16:23,220 --> 00:16:25,370
that and that's and that's fine the
difficulty with all of that is that it's

988
00:16:25,370 --> 00:16:25,380
difficulty with all of that is that it's
 

989
00:16:25,380 --> 00:16:27,650
difficulty with all of that is that it's
incredibly hard to reverse so this is a

990
00:16:27,650 --> 00:16:27,660
incredibly hard to reverse so this is a
 

991
00:16:27,660 --> 00:16:29,030
incredibly hard to reverse so this is a
really hard inverse problem right if you

992
00:16:29,030 --> 00:16:29,040
really hard inverse problem right if you
 

993
00:16:29,040 --> 00:16:30,170
really hard inverse problem right if you
look at a bunch of termites and they

994
00:16:30,170 --> 00:16:30,180
look at a bunch of termites and they
 

995
00:16:30,180 --> 00:16:31,490
look at a bunch of termites and they
make a you know a thing with a single

996
00:16:31,490 --> 00:16:31,500
make a you know a thing with a single
 

997
00:16:31,500 --> 00:16:33,050
make a you know a thing with a single
chimney and you say well I like it but

998
00:16:33,050 --> 00:16:33,060
chimney and you say well I like it but
 

999
00:16:33,060 --> 00:16:35,389
chimney and you say well I like it but
I'd like two chimneys how do you change

1000
00:16:35,389 --> 00:16:35,399
I'd like two chimneys how do you change
 

1001
00:16:35,399 --> 00:16:36,949
I'd like two chimneys how do you change
the rules of behavior for each termite

1002
00:16:36,949 --> 00:16:36,959
the rules of behavior for each termite
 

1003
00:16:36,959 --> 00:16:38,629
the rules of behavior for each termite
so they make two chimneys right or or if

1004
00:16:38,629 --> 00:16:38,639
so they make two chimneys right or or if
 

1005
00:16:38,639 --> 00:16:40,670
so they make two chimneys right or or if
you say hear a bunch of cells that are

1006
00:16:40,670 --> 00:16:40,680
you say hear a bunch of cells that are
 

1007
00:16:40,680 --> 00:16:42,710
you say hear a bunch of cells that are
creating this kind of organism I I don't

1008
00:16:42,710 --> 00:16:42,720
creating this kind of organism I I don't
 

1009
00:16:42,720 --> 00:16:44,150
creating this kind of organism I I don't
think that's optimal I'd like to to

1010
00:16:44,150 --> 00:16:44,160
think that's optimal I'd like to to
 

1011
00:16:44,160 --> 00:16:46,009
think that's optimal I'd like to to
repair that birth defect how do you

1012
00:16:46,009 --> 00:16:46,019
repair that birth defect how do you
 

1013
00:16:46,019 --> 00:16:47,629
repair that birth defect how do you

salamander it's got an arm you can you
 

1055
00:17:24,900 --> 00:17:27,530
salamander it's got an arm you can you
can amputate that arm anywhere along the

salamander arm has been completed so
 

1069
00:17:37,679 --> 00:17:38,870
salamander arm has been completed so
that tells you that's the right that's a

1070
00:17:38,870 --> 00:17:38,880
that tells you that's the right that's a
 

1071
00:17:38,880 --> 00:17:41,570
that tells you that's the right that's a
that's a uh a mean Zen's kind of

1072
00:17:41,570 --> 00:17:41,580
that's a uh a mean Zen's kind of
 

1073
00:17:41,580 --> 00:17:43,669
that's a uh a mean Zen's kind of
analysis where it has to know what the

00:17:43,669 --> 00:17:43,679
analysis where it has to know what the
 

1075
00:17:43,679 --> 00:17:45,230

correct limb is supposed to look like
 

1077
00:17:45,240 --> 00:17:47,570
correct limb is supposed to look like
right so it has a way to ascertain the

1078
00:17:47,570 --> 00:17:47,580
right so it has a way to ascertain the
 

1079
00:17:47,580 --> 00:17:48,830
right so it has a way to ascertain the
current shape it has a way to measure

1080
00:17:48,830 --> 00:17:48,840
current shape it has a way to measure
 

1081
00:17:48,840 --> 00:17:50,510
current shape it has a way to measure
that Delta from from what shape it's

that Delta from from what shape it's
 

1083
00:17:50,520 --> 00:17:52,070
that Delta from from what shape it's
supposed to be and then we'll keep

1084
00:17:52,070 --> 00:17:52,080
supposed to be and then we'll keep
 

1085
00:17:52,080 --> 00:17:53,870
supposed to be and then we'll keep
taking actions meaning Remodeling and

complete so once you know that and we've
 

1091
00:17:57,000 --> 00:17:58,490
complete so once you know that and we've
taken advantage of this in the lab to do

00:17:58,490 --> 00:17:58,500
taken advantage of this in the lab to do
 

1093
00:17:58,500 --> 00:18:00,110
taken advantage of this in the lab to do

00:18:03,900 --> 00:18:05,870
once you know that
um you can start playing with that uh

1100
00:18:05,870 --> 00:18:05,880
um you can start playing with that uh
 

1101
00:18:05,880 --> 00:18:07,610
um you can start playing with that uh
with that homeostatic cycle you can ask

1102
00:18:07,610 --> 00:18:07,620
with that homeostatic cycle you can ask
 

1103
00:18:07,620 --> 00:18:08,930
with that homeostatic cycle you can ask
for example well how does it remember

1104
00:18:08,930 --> 00:18:08,940
for example well how does it remember
 

1105
00:18:08,940 --> 00:18:10,310
for example well how does it remember
what the correct shape is and can we

1106
00:18:10,310 --> 00:18:10,320
what the correct shape is and can we
 

1107
00:18:10,320 --> 00:18:11,870
what the correct shape is and can we
mess with that memory can we give it a

1108
00:18:11,870 --> 00:18:11,880
mess with that memory can we give it a
 

1109
00:18:11,880 --> 00:18:13,190
mess with that memory can we give it a
false memory of what the shape should be

1110
00:18:13,190 --> 00:18:13,200
false memory of what the shape should be
 

1111
00:18:13,200 --> 00:18:14,750
false memory of what the shape should be
and let the cells build something else

1112
00:18:14,750 --> 00:18:14,760
and let the cells build something else
 

1113
00:18:14,760 --> 00:18:16,250
and let the cells build something else
or can we mess with the measurement

1114
00:18:16,250 --> 00:18:16,260
or can we mess with the measurement
 

1115
00:18:16,260 --> 00:18:18,890
or can we mess with the measurement
apparatus right so it gives you it gives

1116
00:18:18,890 --> 00:18:18,900
apparatus right so it gives you it gives
 

1117
00:18:18,900 --> 00:18:21,590
apparatus right so it gives you it gives
you those kinds of so so the idea is to

1118
00:18:21,590 --> 00:18:21,600
you those kinds of so so the idea is to
 

1119
00:18:21,600 --> 00:18:25,130
you those kinds of so so the idea is to
basically appropriate a lot of the um

1120
00:18:25,130 --> 00:18:25,140
basically appropriate a lot of the um
 

1121
00:18:25,140 --> 00:18:27,650
basically appropriate a lot of the um
approaches and Concepts from cognitive

1122
00:18:27,650 --> 00:18:27,660
approaches and Concepts from cognitive
 

1123
00:18:27,660 --> 00:18:29,990
approaches and Concepts from cognitive
neuroscience and Behavioral Science into

1124
00:18:29,990 --> 00:18:30,000
neuroscience and Behavioral Science into
 

1125
00:18:30,000 --> 00:18:32,150
neuroscience and Behavioral Science into
things that uh previously were taken to

1126
00:18:32,150 --> 00:18:32,160
things that uh previously were taken to
 

1127
00:18:32,160 --> 00:18:34,070
things that uh previously were taken to
be dumb materials and you know you get

1128
00:18:34,070 --> 00:18:34,080
be dumb materials and you know you get
 

1129
00:18:34,080 --> 00:18:35,690
be dumb materials and you know you get
yelled at in class if you if you for

1130
00:18:35,690 --> 00:18:35,700
yelled at in class if you if you for
 

1131
00:18:35,700 --> 00:18:37,190
yelled at in class if you if you for
being anthropomorphic if you said well

1132
00:18:37,190 --> 00:18:37,200
being anthropomorphic if you said well
 

1133
00:18:37,200 --> 00:18:38,690
being anthropomorphic if you said well
my cells want to do this and my cells

1134
00:18:38,690 --> 00:18:38,700
my cells want to do this and my cells
 

1135
00:18:38,700 --> 00:18:40,190
my cells want to do this and my cells
want to do that and I think I think

1136
00:18:40,190 --> 00:18:40,200
want to do that and I think I think
 

1137
00:18:40,200 --> 00:18:41,690
want to do that and I think I think
that's a that's a major mistake that

1138
00:18:41,690 --> 00:18:41,700
that's a that's a major mistake that
 

1139
00:18:41,700 --> 00:18:43,250
that's a that's a major mistake that
leaves a ton of capabilities on the

1140
00:18:43,250 --> 00:18:43,260
leaves a ton of capabilities on the
 

1141
00:18:43,260 --> 00:18:45,470
leaves a ton of capabilities on the
table so thinking about biologic systems

1142
00:18:45,470 --> 00:18:45,480
table so thinking about biologic systems
 

1143
00:18:45,480 --> 00:18:47,930
table so thinking about biologic systems
is things that have memory have almost

1144
00:18:47,930 --> 00:18:47,940
is things that have memory have almost
 

1145
00:18:47,940 --> 00:18:51,169
is things that have memory have almost
something like cognitive ability

1146
00:18:51,169 --> 00:18:51,179
something like cognitive ability
 

1147
00:18:51,179 --> 00:18:53,150
something like cognitive ability
but

1148
00:18:53,150 --> 00:18:53,160
but
 

1149
00:18:53,160 --> 00:18:54,549
but
I mean

1150
00:18:54,549 --> 00:18:54,559
I mean
 

1151
00:18:54,559 --> 00:18:58,070
I mean
how incredible is it you know that the

1152
00:18:58,070 --> 00:18:58,080
how incredible is it you know that the
 

1153
00:18:58,080 --> 00:18:59,870
how incredible is it you know that the
salamander arm is being

1154
00:18:59,870 --> 00:18:59,880
salamander arm is being
 

1155
00:18:59,880 --> 00:19:03,049
salamander arm is being
rebuilt not with a dictator

1156
00:19:03,049 --> 00:19:03,059
rebuilt not with a dictator
 

1157
00:19:03,059 --> 00:19:04,909
rebuilt not with a dictator
it's kind of like the cellular automata

1158
00:19:04,909 --> 00:19:04,919
it's kind of like the cellular automata
 

1159
00:19:04,919 --> 00:19:06,650
it's kind of like the cellular automata
system all the individual workers are

1160
00:19:06,650 --> 00:19:06,660
system all the individual workers are
 

1161
00:19:06,660 --> 00:19:08,029
system all the individual workers are
doing their own thing

1162
00:19:08,029 --> 00:19:08,039
doing their own thing
 

1163
00:19:08,039 --> 00:19:11,450
doing their own thing
so where's that oh wait top down signal

1164
00:19:11,450 --> 00:19:11,460
so where's that oh wait top down signal
 

1165
00:19:11,460 --> 00:19:13,370
so where's that oh wait top down signal
that doesn't control coming from like

1166
00:19:13,370 --> 00:19:13,380
that doesn't control coming from like
 

1167
00:19:13,380 --> 00:19:15,950
that doesn't control coming from like
how can you find it yeah like why does

1168
00:19:15,950 --> 00:19:15,960
how can you find it yeah like why does
 

1169
00:19:15,960 --> 00:19:17,930
how can you find it yeah like why does
it stop growing how does it know the

1170
00:19:17,930 --> 00:19:17,940
it stop growing how does it know the
 

1171
00:19:17,940 --> 00:19:19,850
it stop growing how does it know the
shape how does it have memory of the

1172
00:19:19,850 --> 00:19:19,860
shape how does it have memory of the
 

1173
00:19:19,860 --> 00:19:22,250
shape how does it have memory of the
shape and how does it tell everybody to

1174
00:19:22,250 --> 00:19:22,260
shape and how does it tell everybody to
 

1175
00:19:22,260 --> 00:19:24,049
shape and how does it tell everybody to
be like whoa whoa slow down we're done

1176
00:19:24,049 --> 00:19:24,059
be like whoa whoa slow down we're done
 

1177
00:19:24,059 --> 00:19:26,450
be like whoa whoa slow down we're done
so the first thing to to think about I

1178
00:19:26,450 --> 00:19:26,460
so the first thing to to think about I
 

1179
00:19:26,460 --> 00:19:29,390
so the first thing to to think about I
think is that there are no examples

1180
00:19:29,390 --> 00:19:29,400
think is that there are no examples
 

1181
00:19:29,400 --> 00:19:31,850
think is that there are no examples
anywhere of of a central dictator

1182
00:19:31,850 --> 00:19:31,860
anywhere of of a central dictator
 

1183
00:19:31,860 --> 00:19:33,950
anywhere of of a central dictator
because in in this in this kind of

1184
00:19:33,950 --> 00:19:33,960
because in in this in this kind of
 

1185
00:19:33,960 --> 00:19:36,230
because in in this in this kind of
science because everything is made of

1186
00:19:36,230 --> 00:19:36,240
science because everything is made of
 

1187
00:19:36,240 --> 00:19:38,630
science because everything is made of
parts and so we we even though we we

1188
00:19:38,630 --> 00:19:38,640
parts and so we we even though we we
 

1189
00:19:38,640 --> 00:19:41,150
parts and so we we even though we we
feel as a unified Central sort of

1190
00:19:41,150 --> 00:19:41,160
feel as a unified Central sort of
 

1191
00:19:41,160 --> 00:19:43,130
feel as a unified Central sort of
intelligence and kind of point of of

1192
00:19:43,130 --> 00:19:43,140
intelligence and kind of point of of
 

1193
00:19:43,140 --> 00:19:45,590
intelligence and kind of point of of
cognition we are a bag of neurons right

1194
00:19:45,590 --> 00:19:45,600
cognition we are a bag of neurons right
 

1195
00:19:45,600 --> 00:19:47,330
cognition we are a bag of neurons right
we all intelligence is collective

1196
00:19:47,330 --> 00:19:47,340
we all intelligence is collective
 

1197
00:19:47,340 --> 00:19:49,010
we all intelligence is collective
intelligence there's this this is

1198
00:19:49,010 --> 00:19:49,020
intelligence there's this this is
 

1199
00:19:49,020 --> 00:19:51,289
intelligence there's this this is
important to kind of um and think about

1200
00:19:51,289 --> 00:19:51,299
important to kind of um and think about
 

1201
00:19:51,299 --> 00:19:52,430
important to kind of um and think about
because a lot of people think okay

1202
00:19:52,430 --> 00:19:52,440
because a lot of people think okay
 

1203
00:19:52,440 --> 00:19:55,070
because a lot of people think okay
there's real intelligence like me and

1204
00:19:55,070 --> 00:19:55,080
there's real intelligence like me and
 

1205
00:19:55,080 --> 00:19:56,330
there's real intelligence like me and
then there's collective intelligence

1206
00:19:56,330 --> 00:19:56,340
then there's collective intelligence
 

1207
00:19:56,340 --> 00:19:58,190
then there's collective intelligence
which is the ants and flocks of birds

1208
00:19:58,190 --> 00:19:58,200
which is the ants and flocks of birds
 

1209
00:19:58,200 --> 00:19:59,870
which is the ants and flocks of birds
and you know termites and things like

1210
00:19:59,870 --> 00:19:59,880
and you know termites and things like
 

1211
00:19:59,880 --> 00:20:02,270
and you know termites and things like
that and and you know and and maybe it's

1212
00:20:02,270 --> 00:20:02,280
that and and you know and and maybe it's
 

1213
00:20:02,280 --> 00:20:04,070
that and and you know and and maybe it's
appropriate to think of them as a as a

1214
00:20:04,070 --> 00:20:04,080
appropriate to think of them as a as a
 

1215
00:20:04,080 --> 00:20:06,230
appropriate to think of them as a as a
as an individual and maybe it's not a

1216
00:20:06,230 --> 00:20:06,240
as an individual and maybe it's not a
 

1217
00:20:06,240 --> 00:20:07,430
as an individual and maybe it's not a
lot of people are skeptical about about

1218
00:20:07,430 --> 00:20:07,440
lot of people are skeptical about about
 

1219
00:20:07,440 --> 00:20:09,169
lot of people are skeptical about about
that and so on but you've got to realize

1220
00:20:09,169 --> 00:20:09,179
that and so on but you've got to realize
 

1221
00:20:09,179 --> 00:20:11,330
that and so on but you've got to realize
that we are not there's no such thing as

1222
00:20:11,330 --> 00:20:11,340
that we are not there's no such thing as
 

1223
00:20:11,340 --> 00:20:13,070
that we are not there's no such thing as
this like indivisible Diamond of

1224
00:20:13,070 --> 00:20:13,080
this like indivisible Diamond of
 

1225
00:20:13,080 --> 00:20:14,510
this like indivisible Diamond of
intelligence that's like this one

1226
00:20:14,510 --> 00:20:14,520
intelligence that's like this one
 

1227
00:20:14,520 --> 00:20:15,950
intelligence that's like this one
Central thing that's not made of parts

1228
00:20:15,950 --> 00:20:15,960
Central thing that's not made of parts
 

1229
00:20:15,960 --> 00:20:18,770
Central thing that's not made of parts
we are all made of parts and so if if

1230
00:20:18,770 --> 00:20:18,780
we are all made of parts and so if if
 

1231
00:20:18,780 --> 00:20:20,750
we are all made of parts and so if if
you believe that which I think is is

1232
00:20:20,750 --> 00:20:20,760
you believe that which I think is is
 

1233
00:20:20,760 --> 00:20:23,510
you believe that which I think is is
hard to uh to get around that that we in

1234
00:20:23,510 --> 00:20:23,520
hard to uh to get around that that we in
 

1235
00:20:23,520 --> 00:20:25,669
hard to uh to get around that that we in
fact have a centralized um set of goals

1236
00:20:25,669 --> 00:20:25,679
fact have a centralized um set of goals
 

1237
00:20:25,679 --> 00:20:27,289
fact have a centralized um set of goals
and preferences and we plan and we do

1238
00:20:27,289 --> 00:20:27,299
and preferences and we plan and we do
 

1239
00:20:27,299 --> 00:20:29,390
and preferences and we plan and we do
things and so on you are already

1240
00:20:29,390 --> 00:20:29,400
things and so on you are already
 

1241
00:20:29,400 --> 00:20:30,950
things and so on you are already
committed to the fact that a collection

1242
00:20:30,950 --> 00:20:30,960
committed to the fact that a collection
 

1243
00:20:30,960 --> 00:20:32,690
committed to the fact that a collection
of cells is able to do this because we

1244
00:20:32,690 --> 00:20:32,700
of cells is able to do this because we
 

1245
00:20:32,700 --> 00:20:34,010
of cells is able to do this because we
are a collection of cells there's no

1246
00:20:34,010 --> 00:20:34,020
are a collection of cells there's no
 

1247
00:20:34,020 --> 00:20:35,870
are a collection of cells there's no
getting around that in our case what we

1248
00:20:35,870 --> 00:20:35,880
getting around that in our case what we
 

1249
00:20:35,880 --> 00:20:37,370
getting around that in our case what we
do is we navigate the three-dimensional

1250
00:20:37,370 --> 00:20:37,380
do is we navigate the three-dimensional
 

1251
00:20:37,380 --> 00:20:39,230
do is we navigate the three-dimensional
world and we have Behavior this is

1252
00:20:39,230 --> 00:20:39,240
world and we have Behavior this is
 

1253
00:20:39,240 --> 00:20:41,029
world and we have Behavior this is
blowing my mind right now because we are

1254
00:20:41,029 --> 00:20:41,039
blowing my mind right now because we are
 

1255
00:20:41,039 --> 00:20:42,650
blowing my mind right now because we are
just a collection of stuff oh yeah yeah

1256
00:20:42,650 --> 00:20:42,660
just a collection of stuff oh yeah yeah
 

1257
00:20:42,660 --> 00:20:46,370
just a collection of stuff oh yeah yeah
so when I'm moving this arm

1258
00:20:46,370 --> 00:20:46,380

 

1259
00:20:46,380 --> 00:20:49,850

1287
00:21:18,059 --> 00:21:19,730
that we've ever seen is is a collective
of some of something it's just that

00:21:19,730 --> 00:21:19,740
of some of something it's just that
 

1289
00:21:19,740 --> 00:21:21,110

we're used to it we're used to that you

00:21:21,110 --> 00:21:21,120
we're used to it we're used to that you
 

1291
00:21:21,120 --> 00:21:22,370
we're used to it we're used to that you
know we're used to okay this thing is

1292
00:21:22,370 --> 00:21:22,380
know we're used to okay this thing is
 

1293
00:21:22,380 --> 00:21:23,450
know we're used to okay this thing is
kind of a single thing but it's really

1294
00:21:23,450 --> 00:21:23,460
kind of a single thing but it's really
 

1295
00:21:23,460 --> 00:21:24,770
kind of a single thing but it's really
not you zoom in you know what you see

1296
00:21:24,770 --> 00:21:24,780
not you zoom in you know what you see
 

1297
00:21:24,780 --> 00:21:26,330
not you zoom in you know what you see
you see a bunch of cells running around

1298
00:21:26,330 --> 00:21:26,340
you see a bunch of cells running around
 

1299
00:21:26,340 --> 00:21:28,850
you see a bunch of cells running around
and so is there some unifying I mean

1300
00:21:28,850 --> 00:21:28,860
and so is there some unifying I mean
 

1301
00:21:28,860 --> 00:21:30,770
and so is there some unifying I mean
we're just jumping around but that

1302
00:21:30,770 --> 00:21:30,780
we're just jumping around but that
 

1303
00:21:30,780 --> 00:21:33,470
we're just jumping around but that
something that you look as the the

1304
00:21:33,470 --> 00:21:33,480
something that you look as the the
 

1305
00:21:33,480 --> 00:21:38,529
something that you look as the the
biological signal versus the biochemical

1306
00:21:38,529 --> 00:21:38,539
biological signal versus the biochemical
 

1307

the
 

1309
00:21:40,080 --> 00:21:42,830
the
um the chemistry the electricity

1310
00:21:42,830 --> 00:21:42,840
um the chemistry the electricity
 

1311
00:21:42,840 --> 00:21:45,250
um the chemistry the electricity
maybe the life isn't that

1312
00:21:45,250 --> 00:21:45,260
maybe the life isn't that
 

1313
00:21:45,260 --> 00:21:47,690
maybe the life isn't that
versus the cells

1314
00:21:47,690 --> 00:21:47,700
versus the cells
 

1315
00:21:47,700 --> 00:21:50,450
versus the cells
it's the uh there's there's an orchestra

1316
00:21:50,450 --> 00:21:50,460
it's the uh there's there's an orchestra
 

1317
00:21:50,460 --> 00:21:55,730
it's the uh there's there's an orchestra
playing and uh the resulting music is

1318
00:21:55,730 --> 00:21:55,740
playing and uh the resulting music is

that's Dennis Nobles uh kind of view of

1322
00:22:01,130 --> 00:22:01,140
that's Dennis Nobles uh kind of view of
 

1323
00:22:01,140 --> 00:22:02,870
that's Dennis Nobles uh kind of view of
things he has two really good books

1324
00:22:02,870 --> 00:22:02,880
things he has two really good books
 

1325
00:22:02,880 --> 00:22:03,950
things he has two really good books
where he talks about this musical

1326
00:22:03,950 --> 00:22:03,960
where he talks about this musical
 

1327
00:22:03,960 --> 00:22:05,450
where he talks about this musical
analogy right so so I think that's

1328
00:22:05,450 --> 00:22:05,460
analogy right so so I think that's
 

1329
00:22:05,460 --> 00:22:08,390
analogy right so so I think that's
that's I like it um I like it is it

1330
00:22:08,390 --> 00:22:08,400
that's I like it um I like it is it
 

1331
00:22:08,400 --> 00:22:09,830
that's I like it um I like it is it
wrong though I don't think it's no I

1332
00:22:09,830 --> 00:22:09,840
wrong though I don't think it's no I
 

1333
00:22:09,840 --> 00:22:11,029
wrong though I don't think it's no I
don't think it's wrong

1334
00:22:11,029 --> 00:22:11,039
don't think it's wrong
 

1335
00:22:11,039 --> 00:22:12,529
don't think it's wrong
um I don't I don't think it's wrong I

1336
00:22:12,529 --> 00:22:12,539
um I don't I don't think it's wrong I
 

1337
00:22:12,539 --> 00:22:14,690
um I don't I don't think it's wrong I
think I think the important thing about

1338
00:22:14,690 --> 00:22:14,700
think I think the important thing about
 

1339
00:22:14,700 --> 00:22:18,350
think I think the important thing about
it is that we have to come to grips with

1340
00:22:18,350 --> 00:22:18,360
it is that we have to come to grips with
 

1341
00:22:18,360 --> 00:22:22,850
it is that we have to come to grips with
the fact that a true a a true proper uh

1342
00:22:22,850 --> 00:22:22,860
the fact that a true a a true proper uh
 

1343
00:22:22,860 --> 00:22:24,830
the fact that a true a a true proper uh

cognitive intelligence can still be made
of Parts those things are and in fact it

1346
00:22:26,750 --> 00:22:26,760
of Parts those things are and in fact it
 

1347
00:22:26,760 --> 00:22:28,430
of Parts those things are and in fact it
has to be and I I think it's a real

1348

has to be and I I think it's a real
 

1349
00:22:28,440 --> 00:22:30,529
has to be and I I think it's a real
shame but I see this all the time when

1350
00:22:30,529 --> 00:22:30,539
shame but I see this all the time when
 

1351
00:22:30,539 --> 00:22:32,149
shame but I see this all the time when
you have uh when you have a collective

1352
00:22:32,149 --> 00:22:32,159
you have uh when you have a collective
 

1353
00:22:32,159 --> 00:22:34,490
you have uh when you have a collective
like this whether it be uh a group of

1354
00:22:34,490 --> 00:22:34,500
like this whether it be uh a group of
 

1355
00:22:34,500 --> 00:22:36,770
like this whether it be uh a group of
robots or a you know a collection of

1356
00:22:36,770 --> 00:22:36,780
robots or a you know a collection of

cognition that's just physics I think

1372
00:22:53,750 --> 00:22:53,760
cognition that's just physics I think
 

1373
00:22:53,760 --> 00:22:55,430
cognition that's just physics I think
this is this is fundamentally flawed

1374
00:22:55,430 --> 00:22:55,440
this is this is fundamentally flawed
 

1375
00:22:55,440 --> 00:22:57,350
this is this is fundamentally flawed
because if you zoom into anything what

1376
00:22:57,350 --> 00:22:57,360
because if you zoom into anything what
 

1377
00:22:57,360 --> 00:22:58,490
because if you zoom into anything what
are you going to see of course you're

1378
00:22:58,490 --> 00:22:58,500
are you going to see of course you're
 

1379
00:22:58,500 --> 00:22:59,690
are you going to see of course you're
just going to see physics what else

1380
00:22:59,690 --> 00:22:59,700
just going to see physics what else
 

1381
00:22:59,700 --> 00:23:00,830
just going to see physics what else
could be underneath right that's not

could be underneath right that's not
 

1383
00:23:00,840 --> 00:23:01,850

going to be fairy dust it's going to be
physics and chemistry but that doesn't

1386
00:23:03,470 --> 00:23:03,480
physics and chemistry but that doesn't
 

1387
00:23:03,480 --> 00:23:04,970
physics and chemistry but that doesn't
take away from the magic of the fact

1388
00:23:04,970 --> 00:23:04,980
take away from the magic of the fact
 

1389
00:23:04,980 --> 00:23:06,950
take away from the magic of the fact
that there are certain ways to arrange

00:23:06,950 --> 00:23:06,960
that there are certain ways to arrange
 

1391
00:23:06,960 --> 00:23:08,330
that there are certain ways to arrange
that physics and chemistry and in

that physics and chemistry and in
 

1393
00:23:08,340 --> 00:23:10,130
that physics and chemistry and in
particular the bioelectricity which I

1394
00:23:10,130 --> 00:23:10,140
particular the bioelectricity which I
 

1395
00:23:10,140 --> 00:23:14,390

like a lot uh to give you an emergent uh

1396
00:23:14,390 --> 00:23:14,400
like a lot uh to give you an emergent uh

Collective with goals and preferences

1398
00:23:16,430 --> 00:23:16,440
Collective with goals and preferences
 

1399
00:23:16,440 --> 00:23:19,250
Collective with goals and preferences
and memories and anticipations that do

1400
00:23:19,250 --> 00:23:19,260
and memories and anticipations that do
 

1401
00:23:19,260 --> 00:23:21,230
and memories and anticipations that do
not belong to any of the subunits so I

1402
00:23:21,230 --> 00:23:21,240
not belong to any of the subunits so I
 

1403
00:23:21,240 --> 00:23:22,490
not belong to any of the subunits so I
think what we're getting into here and

1404
00:23:22,490 --> 00:23:22,500
think what we're getting into here and
 

1405
00:23:22,500 --> 00:23:24,230
think what we're getting into here and
we can talk about how how this happens

1406
00:23:24,230 --> 00:23:24,240
we can talk about how how this happens
 

1407
00:23:24,240 --> 00:23:25,970
we can talk about how how this happens
during embryogenesis and so on what

1408
00:23:25,970 --> 00:23:25,980
during embryogenesis and so on what
 

1409
00:23:25,980 --> 00:23:28,370
during embryogenesis and so on what
we're getting into is the origin of the

1410
00:23:28,370 --> 00:23:28,380
we're getting into is the origin of the
 

1411
00:23:28,380 --> 00:23:30,950
we're getting into is the origin of the
of a self yeah with a big with a capital

1412
00:23:30,950 --> 00:23:30,960
of a self yeah with a big with a capital

00:23:30,960 --> 00:23:33,169
of a self yeah with a big with a capital
S so we ourselves there are many other

1414
00:23:33,169 --> 00:23:33,179
S so we ourselves there are many other
 

1415
00:23:33,179 --> 00:23:34,549
S so we ourselves there are many other
kinds of selves and we can tell some

1416
00:23:34,549 --> 00:23:34,559
kinds of selves and we can tell some
 

1417
00:23:34,559 --> 00:23:35,870
kinds of selves and we can tell some
really interesting stories about where

1418
00:23:35,870 --> 00:23:35,880
really interesting stories about where
 

1419
00:23:35,880 --> 00:23:37,610
really interesting stories about where
selves come from and how they become

1420
00:23:37,610 --> 00:23:37,620
selves come from and how they become
 

1421
00:23:37,620 --> 00:23:40,370
selves come from and how they become
unified yeah is this the first

1422
00:23:40,370 --> 00:23:40,380
unified yeah is this the first
 

1423
00:23:40,380 --> 00:23:42,110
unified yeah is this the first
or at least humans tend to think that

1424
00:23:42,110 --> 00:23:42,120
or at least humans tend to think that
 

1425
00:23:42,120 --> 00:23:44,390
or at least humans tend to think that
this is the the level at which the self

1426
00:23:44,390 --> 00:23:44,400
this is the the level at which the self
 

1427
00:23:44,400 --> 00:23:47,510
this is the the level at which the self
with the capital s is first born

1428
00:23:47,510 --> 00:23:47,520
with the capital s is first born
 

1429
00:23:47,520 --> 00:23:51,710
with the capital s is first born
but uh and we really don't want to see

1430
00:23:51,710 --> 00:23:51,720
but uh and we really don't want to see
 

1431
00:23:51,720 --> 00:23:53,690
but uh and we really don't want to see
um human civilization or Earth itself as

1432
00:23:53,690 --> 00:23:53,700
um human civilization or Earth itself as
 

1433
00:23:53,700 --> 00:23:55,970
um human civilization or Earth itself as
one living organism yeah that's very

1434
00:23:55,970 --> 00:23:55,980
one living organism yeah that's very
 

1435
00:23:55,980 --> 00:23:59,630
one living organism yeah that's very
uncomfortable to us it is yeah but is um

1436
00:23:59,630 --> 00:23:59,640
uncomfortable to us it is yeah but is um
 

1437
00:23:59,640 --> 00:24:01,850
uncomfortable to us it is yeah but is um
yeah where's the self born we have to

1438
00:24:01,850 --> 00:24:01,860
yeah where's the self born we have to
 

1439
00:24:01,860 --> 00:24:03,710
yeah where's the self born we have to
grow up past that so what I like to do

1440
00:24:03,710 --> 00:24:03,720
grow up past that so what I like to do
 

1441
00:24:03,720 --> 00:24:05,870
grow up past that so what I like to do
is uh I'll tell you two quick stories

1442
00:24:05,870 --> 00:24:05,880
is uh I'll tell you two quick stories
 

1443
00:24:05,880 --> 00:24:07,850
is uh I'll tell you two quick stories
about that I like to roll backwards so

1444
00:24:07,850 --> 00:24:07,860
about that I like to roll backwards so
 

1445
00:24:07,860 --> 00:24:10,010
about that I like to roll backwards so
so as opposed to so if you start and you

1446
00:24:10,010 --> 00:24:10,020
so as opposed to so if you start and you
 

1447
00:24:10,020 --> 00:24:11,690
so as opposed to so if you start and you
say okay here's a paramecium and you see

1448
00:24:11,690 --> 00:24:11,700
say okay here's a paramecium and you see
 

1449
00:24:11,700 --> 00:24:12,950
say okay here's a paramecium and you see
it um you know it's a single cell

1450
00:24:12,950 --> 00:24:12,960
it um you know it's a single cell
 

1451
00:24:12,960 --> 00:24:14,450
it um you know it's a single cell
organism you see it doing various things

1452
00:24:14,450 --> 00:24:14,460
organism you see it doing various things
 

1453
00:24:14,460 --> 00:24:16,490
organism you see it doing various things
and people will say okay I'm sure

1454
00:24:16,490 --> 00:24:16,500
and people will say okay I'm sure
 

1455
00:24:16,500 --> 00:24:18,049
and people will say okay I'm sure
there's some chemical story to be told

1456
00:24:18,049 --> 00:24:18,059
there's some chemical story to be told
 

1457
00:24:18,059 --> 00:24:19,669
there's some chemical story to be told
about how it's doing it so that's not

1458
00:24:19,669 --> 00:24:19,679
about how it's doing it so that's not
 

1459
00:24:19,679 --> 00:24:20,990
about how it's doing it so that's not
true cognition right and people will

1460
00:24:20,990 --> 00:24:21,000
true cognition right and people will
 

1461
00:24:21,000 --> 00:24:23,270
true cognition right and people will
argue about that I I like to work it

1462
00:24:23,270 --> 00:24:23,280
argue about that I I like to work it
 

1463
00:24:23,280 --> 00:24:25,250
argue about that I I like to work it
backwards I said let's let's agree that

1464
00:24:25,250 --> 00:24:25,260
backwards I said let's let's agree that
 

1465
00:24:25,260 --> 00:24:27,649
backwards I said let's let's agree that
you and I as as we sit here are examples

1466
00:24:27,649 --> 00:24:27,659
you and I as as we sit here are examples
 

1467
00:24:27,659 --> 00:24:29,330
you and I as as we sit here are examples
of true cognition if anything is if

1468
00:24:29,330 --> 00:24:29,340
of true cognition if anything is if
 

1469
00:24:29,340 --> 00:24:30,590
of true cognition if anything is if
there's anything that's true cognition

1470
00:24:30,590 --> 00:24:30,600
there's anything that's true cognition
 

1471
00:24:30,600 --> 00:24:32,510
there's anything that's true cognition
we are we are examples of it now let's

1472
00:24:32,510 --> 00:24:32,520
we are we are examples of it now let's
 

1473
00:24:32,520 --> 00:24:34,070
we are we are examples of it now let's
just roll back slowly right so you roll

1474
00:24:34,070 --> 00:24:34,080
just roll back slowly right so you roll
 

1475
00:24:34,080 --> 00:24:35,210
just roll back slowly right so you roll
back to the time when you're a small

1476
00:24:35,210 --> 00:24:35,220
back to the time when you're a small
 

1477
00:24:35,220 --> 00:24:37,190
back to the time when you're a small
child and used to doing whatever and

1478
00:24:37,190 --> 00:24:37,200
child and used to doing whatever and
 

1479
00:24:37,200 --> 00:24:38,750
child and used to doing whatever and
then just sort of day by day you roll

1480
00:24:38,750 --> 00:24:38,760
then just sort of day by day you roll
 

1481
00:24:38,760 --> 00:24:40,549
then just sort of day by day you roll
you roll back and eventually you become

1482
00:24:40,549 --> 00:24:40,559
you roll back and eventually you become
 

1483
00:24:40,559 --> 00:24:42,409
you roll back and eventually you become
more or less that paramecium and then

1484
00:24:42,409 --> 00:24:42,419
more or less that paramecium and then
 

1485
00:24:42,419 --> 00:24:44,149
more or less that paramecium and then
and then you sort of even below that

1486
00:24:44,149 --> 00:24:44,159
and then you sort of even below that
 

1487
00:24:44,159 --> 00:24:49,190
and then you sort of even below that
right as an unfertilized Osa so it's no

1488
00:24:49,190 --> 00:24:49,200
right as an unfertilized Osa so it's no
 

1489
00:24:49,200 --> 00:24:51,230
right as an unfertilized Osa so it's no
one has to my knowledge no one has come

1490
00:24:51,230 --> 00:24:51,240
one has to my knowledge no one has come
 

1491
00:24:51,240 --> 00:24:54,470
one has to my knowledge no one has come
up with any convincing discreet Step At

1492
00:24:54,470 --> 00:24:54,480
up with any convincing discreet Step At
 

1493
00:24:54,480 --> 00:24:56,690
up with any convincing discreet Step At
which my cognitive Powers disappear

1494
00:24:56,690 --> 00:24:56,700
which my cognitive Powers disappear
 

1495
00:24:56,700 --> 00:24:58,549
which my cognitive Powers disappear
right it just doesn't the biology

1496
00:24:58,549 --> 00:24:58,559
right it just doesn't the biology
 

1497
00:24:58,559 --> 00:25:00,710
right it just doesn't the biology
doesn't offer any specific step it's com

1498
00:25:00,710 --> 00:25:00,720
doesn't offer any specific step it's com
 

1499
00:25:00,720 --> 00:25:02,450
doesn't offer any specific step it's com
it's incredibly smooth and slow and

1500
00:25:02,450 --> 00:25:02,460
it's incredibly smooth and slow and
 

1501
00:25:02,460 --> 00:25:04,610
it's incredibly smooth and slow and
continuous and so I think this idea that

1502
00:25:04,610 --> 00:25:04,620
continuous and so I think this idea that
 

1503
00:25:04,620 --> 00:25:07,430
continuous and so I think this idea that
it just sort of magically shows up uh at

1504
00:25:07,430 --> 00:25:07,440
it just sort of magically shows up uh at
 

1505
00:25:07,440 --> 00:25:09,289
it just sort of magically shows up uh at
one point and then and then uh you know

1506
00:25:09,289 --> 00:25:09,299
one point and then and then uh you know
 

1507
00:25:09,299 --> 00:25:11,090
one point and then and then uh you know
humans have true selves that don't exist

1508
00:25:11,090 --> 00:25:11,100
humans have true selves that don't exist
 

1509
00:25:11,100 --> 00:25:12,230
humans have true selves that don't exist
elsewhere I think it runs against

1510
00:25:12,230 --> 00:25:12,240
elsewhere I think it runs against
 

1511
00:25:12,240 --> 00:25:13,669
elsewhere I think it runs against
everything we know about Evolution

1512
00:25:13,669 --> 00:25:13,679
everything we know about Evolution
 

1513
00:25:13,679 --> 00:25:15,350
everything we know about Evolution
everything we know about developmental

1514
00:25:15,350 --> 00:25:15,360
everything we know about developmental
 

1515
00:25:15,360 --> 00:25:18,110
everything we know about developmental
biology these are all slow continua and

1516
00:25:18,110 --> 00:25:18,120
biology these are all slow continua and
 

1517
00:25:18,120 --> 00:25:19,730
biology these are all slow continua and
the other really important story I want

1518
00:25:19,730 --> 00:25:19,740
the other really important story I want
 

1519
00:25:19,740 --> 00:25:21,649
the other really important story I want
to tell is where embryos come from so

1520
00:25:21,649 --> 00:25:21,659
to tell is where embryos come from so
 

1521
00:25:21,659 --> 00:25:23,810
to tell is where embryos come from so
think about this for a second amniot

1522
00:25:23,810 --> 00:25:23,820
think about this for a second amniot
 

1523
00:25:23,820 --> 00:25:26,090
think about this for a second amniot
embryo so this is humans birds and so on

1524
00:25:26,090 --> 00:25:26,100
embryo so this is humans birds and so on
 

1525
00:25:26,100 --> 00:25:28,850
embryo so this is humans birds and so on
mammals and birds and so on imagine a

1526
00:25:28,850 --> 00:25:28,860
mammals and birds and so on imagine a
 

1527
00:25:28,860 --> 00:25:31,250
mammals and birds and so on imagine a
flat disc of cells so there's maybe 50

1528
00:25:31,250 --> 00:25:31,260
flat disc of cells so there's maybe 50
 

1529
00:25:31,260 --> 00:25:34,250
flat disc of cells so there's maybe 50
000 cells and in that so when you get an

1530
00:25:34,250 --> 00:25:34,260
000 cells and in that so when you get an
 

1531
00:25:34,260 --> 00:25:35,990
000 cells and in that so when you get an
egg from a from a fertilizer let's say

1532
00:25:35,990 --> 00:25:36,000
egg from a from a fertilizer let's say
 

1533
00:25:36,000 --> 00:25:37,250
egg from a from a fertilizer let's say
you buy a fertilized egg from a farm

1534
00:25:37,250 --> 00:25:37,260
you buy a fertilized egg from a farm
 

1535
00:25:37,260 --> 00:25:40,370
you buy a fertilized egg from a farm
right that that egg uh will will have

1536
00:25:40,370 --> 00:25:40,380
right that that egg uh will will have
 

1537
00:25:40,380 --> 00:25:43,310
right that that egg uh will will have
about 50 000 cells in um in a flat disc

1538
00:25:43,310 --> 00:25:43,320
about 50 000 cells in um in a flat disc
 

1539
00:25:43,320 --> 00:25:44,630
about 50 000 cells in um in a flat disc
it looks like a little little tiny

1540
00:25:44,630 --> 00:25:44,640
it looks like a little little tiny
 

1541
00:25:44,640 --> 00:25:47,570
it looks like a little little tiny
little Frisbee and in that flat disc

1542
00:25:47,570 --> 00:25:47,580
little Frisbee and in that flat disc
 

1543
00:25:47,580 --> 00:25:50,750
little Frisbee and in that flat disc
what will happen is there'll be uh one

1544
00:25:50,750 --> 00:25:50,760
what will happen is there'll be uh one
 

1545
00:25:50,760 --> 00:25:53,390
what will happen is there'll be uh one
one set of cells will uh becomes will

1546
00:25:53,390 --> 00:25:53,400
one set of cells will uh becomes will
 

1547
00:25:53,400 --> 00:25:55,549
one set of cells will uh becomes will
become special and it will tell all the

1548
00:25:55,549 --> 00:25:55,559
become special and it will tell all the
 

1549
00:25:55,559 --> 00:25:57,169
become special and it will tell all the
other cells I'm I'm going to be the head

1550
00:25:57,169 --> 00:25:57,179
other cells I'm I'm going to be the head
 

1551
00:25:57,179 --> 00:25:59,149
other cells I'm I'm going to be the head
you guys don't be the head and so it'll

1552
00:25:59,149 --> 00:25:59,159
you guys don't be the head and so it'll
 

1553
00:25:59,159 --> 00:26:00,769
you guys don't be the head and so it'll
amplify symmetry breaking amplification

1554
00:26:00,769 --> 00:26:00,779
amplify symmetry breaking amplification
 

1555
00:26:00,779 --> 00:26:02,330
amplify symmetry breaking amplification
you get one embryo there's a there's a

1556
00:26:02,330 --> 00:26:02,340
you get one embryo there's a there's a
 

1557
00:26:02,340 --> 00:26:03,409
you get one embryo there's a there's a
you know there's some neural tissue and

1558
00:26:03,409 --> 00:26:03,419
you know there's some neural tissue and
 

1559
00:26:03,419 --> 00:26:06,230
you know there's some neural tissue and
some other stuff forms now now you say

1560
00:26:06,230 --> 00:26:06,240
some other stuff forms now now you say
 

1561
00:26:06,240 --> 00:26:08,570
some other stuff forms now now you say
okay I had one egg and one embryo and

1562
00:26:08,570 --> 00:26:08,580
okay I had one egg and one embryo and
 

1563
00:26:08,580 --> 00:26:09,769
okay I had one egg and one embryo and
then there you go what else could it be

1564
00:26:09,769 --> 00:26:09,779
then there you go what else could it be
 

1565
00:26:09,779 --> 00:26:11,630
then there you go what else could it be
well the reality is and I used to I I

1566
00:26:11,630 --> 00:26:11,640
well the reality is and I used to I I
 

1567
00:26:11,640 --> 00:26:14,029
well the reality is and I used to I I
did all of this as a grad student if you

1568
00:26:14,029 --> 00:26:14,039
did all of this as a grad student if you
 

1569
00:26:14,039 --> 00:26:16,130
did all of this as a grad student if you
um if you take a little needle and you

1570
00:26:16,130 --> 00:26:16,140
um if you take a little needle and you
 

1571
00:26:16,140 --> 00:26:18,230
um if you take a little needle and you
make a scratch in that blasted room in

1572
00:26:18,230 --> 00:26:18,240
make a scratch in that blasted room in
 

1573
00:26:18,240 --> 00:26:19,970
make a scratch in that blasted room in
that in that disc such that the cells

1574
00:26:19,970 --> 00:26:19,980
that in that disc such that the cells
 

1575
00:26:19,980 --> 00:26:21,230
that in that disc such that the cells
can't talk to each other for a while it

1576
00:26:21,230 --> 00:26:21,240
can't talk to each other for a while it
 

1577
00:26:21,240 --> 00:26:22,610
can't talk to each other for a while it
heals up but for a while they can't talk

1578
00:26:22,610 --> 00:26:22,620
heals up but for a while they can't talk
 

1579
00:26:22,620 --> 00:26:24,409
heals up but for a while they can't talk
to each other what will happen is that

1580
00:26:24,409 --> 00:26:24,419
to each other what will happen is that
 

1581
00:26:24,419 --> 00:26:27,710
to each other what will happen is that
uh both regions will decide that they

1582
00:26:27,710 --> 00:26:27,720
uh both regions will decide that they
 

1583
00:26:27,720 --> 00:26:29,090
uh both regions will decide that they
can be the embryo and there will be two

1584
00:26:29,090 --> 00:26:29,100
can be the embryo and there will be two
 

1585
00:26:29,100 --> 00:26:30,169
can be the embryo and there will be two
of them and then when they heal up they

1586
00:26:30,169 --> 00:26:30,179
of them and then when they heal up they
 

1587
00:26:30,179 --> 00:26:31,789
of them and then when they heal up they
become conjoint Twins and you can make

1588
00:26:31,789 --> 00:26:31,799
become conjoint Twins and you can make
 

1589
00:26:31,799 --> 00:26:33,529
become conjoint Twins and you can make
two you can make three you can make lots

1590
00:26:33,529 --> 00:26:33,539
two you can make three you can make lots
 

1591
00:26:33,539 --> 00:26:36,769
two you can make three you can make lots
so the question of how many selves are

1592
00:26:36,769 --> 00:26:36,779
so the question of how many selves are
 

1593
00:26:36,779 --> 00:26:39,890
so the question of how many selves are
in there cannot be answered until it's

1594
00:26:39,890 --> 00:26:39,900
in there cannot be answered until it's
 

1595
00:26:39,900 --> 00:26:41,630
in there cannot be answered until it's
actually played all the way through it

1596
00:26:41,630 --> 00:26:41,640
actually played all the way through it
 

1597
00:26:41,640 --> 00:26:43,130
actually played all the way through it
isn't necessarily that there's just one

1598
00:26:43,130 --> 00:26:43,140
isn't necessarily that there's just one
 

1599
00:26:43,140 --> 00:26:44,690
isn't necessarily that there's just one
there can be many so what you have is

1600
00:26:44,690 --> 00:26:44,700
there can be many so what you have is
 

1601
00:26:44,700 --> 00:26:46,390
there can be many so what you have is
you have this medium this this

1602
00:26:46,390 --> 00:26:46,400
you have this medium this this
 

1603
00:26:46,400 --> 00:26:48,110
you have this medium this this
undifferentiated I'm sure there's a

1604
00:26:48,110 --> 00:26:48,120
undifferentiated I'm sure there's a
 

1605
00:26:48,120 --> 00:26:49,549
undifferentiated I'm sure there's a
there's a psychological

1606
00:26:49,549 --> 00:26:49,559
there's a psychological
 

1607
00:26:49,559 --> 00:26:50,930
there's a psychological
um version of this somewhere that I

1608
00:26:50,930 --> 00:26:50,940
um version of this somewhere that I
 

1609
00:26:50,940 --> 00:26:52,250
um version of this somewhere that I
don't know the proper terminology but

1610
00:26:52,250 --> 00:26:52,260
don't know the proper terminology but
 

1611
00:26:52,260 --> 00:26:53,930
don't know the proper terminology but
you have this you have this list like

1612
00:26:53,930 --> 00:26:53,940
you have this you have this list like
 

1613
00:26:53,940 --> 00:26:55,970
you have this you have this list like
put ocean of potentiality you have these

1614
00:26:55,970 --> 00:26:55,980
put ocean of potentiality you have these
 

1615
00:26:55,980 --> 00:26:58,610
put ocean of potentiality you have these
thousands of cells and some number of

1616
00:26:58,610 --> 00:26:58,620
thousands of cells and some number of
 

1617
00:26:58,620 --> 00:27:00,289
thousands of cells and some number of
individuals are going to be formed out

1618
00:27:00,289 --> 00:27:00,299
individuals are going to be formed out
 

1619
00:27:00,299 --> 00:27:02,090
individuals are going to be formed out
of it usually one sometimes zero

1620
00:27:02,090 --> 00:27:02,100
of it usually one sometimes zero
 

1621
00:27:02,100 --> 00:27:05,810
of it usually one sometimes zero
sometimes several and they they form out

1622
00:27:05,810 --> 00:27:05,820
sometimes several and they they form out
 

1623
00:27:05,820 --> 00:27:07,909
sometimes several and they they form out
of these cells because a region of these

1624
00:27:07,909 --> 00:27:07,919
of these cells because a region of these
 

1625
00:27:07,919 --> 00:27:10,430
of these cells because a region of these
cells organizes into a collective that

1626
00:27:10,430 --> 00:27:10,440
cells organizes into a collective that
 

1627
00:27:10,440 --> 00:27:12,470
cells organizes into a collective that
will have goals goals that individual

1628
00:27:12,470 --> 00:27:12,480
will have goals goals that individual
 

1629
00:27:12,480 --> 00:27:15,049
will have goals goals that individual
cells don't have for example make a limb

1630
00:27:15,049 --> 00:27:15,059
cells don't have for example make a limb
 

1631
00:27:15,059 --> 00:27:16,909
cells don't have for example make a limb
make an eye how many eyes well exactly

1632
00:27:16,909 --> 00:27:16,919
make an eye how many eyes well exactly
 

1633
00:27:16,919 --> 00:27:18,590
make an eye how many eyes well exactly
two so individual cells don't know what

1634
00:27:18,590 --> 00:27:18,600
two so individual cells don't know what
 

1635
00:27:18,600 --> 00:27:19,789
two so individual cells don't know what
an eye is they don't know how many eyes

1636
00:27:19,789 --> 00:27:19,799
an eye is they don't know how many eyes
 

1637
00:27:19,799 --> 00:27:20,810
an eye is they don't know how many eyes
you're supposed to have but the

1638
00:27:20,810 --> 00:27:20,820
you're supposed to have but the
 

1639
00:27:20,820 --> 00:27:22,909
you're supposed to have but the
collective does the collective has goals

1640
00:27:22,909 --> 00:27:22,919
collective does the collective has goals
 

1641
00:27:22,919 --> 00:27:24,529
collective does the collective has goals
and memories and anticipations that the

1642
00:27:24,529 --> 00:27:24,539
and memories and anticipations that the
 

1643
00:27:24,539 --> 00:27:26,750
and memories and anticipations that the
individual cells don't and that that the

1644
00:27:26,750 --> 00:27:26,760
individual cells don't and that that the
 

1645
00:27:26,760 --> 00:27:28,490
individual cells don't and that that the
establishment of that boundary with its

1646
00:27:28,490 --> 00:27:28,500
establishment of that boundary with its
 

1647
00:27:28,500 --> 00:27:31,250
establishment of that boundary with its
own ability to maintain to to pursue

1648
00:27:31,250 --> 00:27:31,260
own ability to maintain to to pursue
 

1649
00:27:31,260 --> 00:27:34,250
own ability to maintain to to pursue
certain goals that's the origin of of

1650
00:27:34,250 --> 00:27:34,260
certain goals that's the origin of of
 

1651
00:27:34,260 --> 00:27:35,570
certain goals that's the origin of of
selfhood

1652
00:27:35,570 --> 00:27:35,580
selfhood
 

1653
00:27:35,580 --> 00:27:40,190
selfhood
but I is that goal

1654
00:27:40,190 --> 00:27:40,200

 

1655
00:27:40,200 --> 00:27:42,470

in there somewhere but they always

1656
00:27:42,470 --> 00:27:42,480
in there somewhere but they always
 

1657
00:27:42,480 --> 00:27:44,870
in there somewhere but they always
destined like are they discovering that

1658
00:27:44,870 --> 00:27:44,880
destined like are they discovering that
 

1659
00:27:44,880 --> 00:27:47,690
destined like are they discovering that
goal like where the hell did Evolution

1660
00:27:47,690 --> 00:27:47,700
goal like where the hell did Evolution
 

1661
00:27:47,700 --> 00:27:50,210
goal like where the hell did Evolution
um discover this when you went from the

1662
00:27:50,210 --> 00:27:50,220
um discover this when you went from the
 

1663
00:27:50,220 --> 00:27:53,570
um discover this when you went from the
prokaryotes to you you carry out excels

1664
00:27:53,570 --> 00:27:53,580
prokaryotes to you you carry out excels
 

1665
00:27:53,580 --> 00:27:55,970
prokaryotes to you you carry out excels
and then they started making groups and

1666
00:27:55,970 --> 00:27:55,980
and then they started making groups and
 

1667
00:27:55,980 --> 00:27:58,490
and then they started making groups and
when you make a certain group you make a

1668
00:27:58,490 --> 00:27:58,500
when you make a certain group you make a
 

1669
00:27:58,500 --> 00:28:01,370
when you make a certain group you make a
you you make it sound

1670
00:28:01,370 --> 00:28:01,380
you you make it sound
 

1671
00:28:01,380 --> 00:28:03,950
you you make it sound
that's such a tricky thing to try to

1672
00:28:03,950 --> 00:28:03,960
that's such a tricky thing to try to
 

1673
00:28:03,960 --> 00:28:06,710
that's such a tricky thing to try to
understand you make it sound like this

1674
00:28:06,710 --> 00:28:06,720
understand you make it sound like this
 

1675
00:28:06,720 --> 00:28:08,990
understand you make it sound like this
cells didn't get together and came up

1676
00:28:08,990 --> 00:28:09,000
cells didn't get together and came up
 

1677
00:28:09,000 --> 00:28:11,750
cells didn't get together and came up
with a goal but the very Act of them

1678
00:28:11,750 --> 00:28:11,760
with a goal but the very Act of them
 

1679
00:28:11,760 --> 00:28:14,769
with a goal but the very Act of them
getting together

1680
00:28:14,769 --> 00:28:14,779

 

1681
00:28:14,779 --> 00:28:17,510

revealed the goal that was always there

1682
00:28:17,510 --> 00:28:17,520
revealed the goal that was always there
 

1683
00:28:17,520 --> 00:28:19,370
revealed the goal that was always there
there was always that potential for that

1684
00:28:19,370 --> 00:28:19,380
there was always that potential for that
 

1685
00:28:19,380 --> 00:28:21,230
there was always that potential for that
goal so the first thing to say is that

1686
00:28:21,230 --> 00:28:21,240
goal so the first thing to say is that
 

1687
00:28:21,240 --> 00:28:22,789
goal so the first thing to say is that
there are way more questions here than

1688
00:28:22,789 --> 00:28:22,799
there are way more questions here than
 

1689
00:28:22,799 --> 00:28:24,409
there are way more questions here than
than certainties okay so everything I'm

1690
00:28:24,409 --> 00:28:24,419
than certainties okay so everything I'm
 

1691
00:28:24,419 --> 00:28:25,549
than certainties okay so everything I'm
telling you is is Cutting Edge

1692
00:28:25,549 --> 00:28:25,559
telling you is is Cutting Edge
 

1693
00:28:25,559 --> 00:28:28,010
telling you is is Cutting Edge
developing you know stuff so so it's not

1694
00:28:28,010 --> 00:28:28,020
developing you know stuff so so it's not
 

1695
00:28:28,020 --> 00:28:29,450
developing you know stuff so so it's not
as if any of us know the answer to this

1696
00:28:29,450 --> 00:28:29,460
as if any of us know the answer to this
 

1697
00:28:29,460 --> 00:28:31,310
as if any of us know the answer to this
but but here's here's here's my opinion

1698
00:28:31,310 --> 00:28:31,320
but but here's here's here's my opinion
 

1699
00:28:31,320 --> 00:28:34,250
but but here's here's here's my opinion
on this I think what evolution I I don't

1700
00:28:34,250 --> 00:28:34,260
on this I think what evolution I I don't
 

1701
00:28:34,260 --> 00:28:36,830
on this I think what evolution I I don't
think that Evolution produces solutions

1702
00:28:36,830 --> 00:28:36,840
think that Evolution produces solutions
 

1703
00:28:36,840 --> 00:28:38,510
think that Evolution produces solutions
to specific problems in other words

1704
00:28:38,510 --> 00:28:38,520
to specific problems in other words
 

1705
00:28:38,520 --> 00:28:40,190
to specific problems in other words
specific environments like here's a frog

1706
00:28:40,190 --> 00:28:40,200
specific environments like here's a frog
 

1707
00:28:40,200 --> 00:28:41,870
specific environments like here's a frog
that can live well in a froggy

1708
00:28:41,870 --> 00:28:41,880
that can live well in a froggy
 

1709
00:28:41,880 --> 00:28:43,549
that can live well in a froggy
environment I think what evolution

1710
00:28:43,549 --> 00:28:43,559
environment I think what evolution
 

1711
00:28:43,559 --> 00:28:46,970
environment I think what evolution
produces is problem-solving machines and

1712
00:28:46,970 --> 00:28:46,980
produces is problem-solving machines and
 

1713
00:28:46,980 --> 00:28:48,649
produces is problem-solving machines and
that that will that will solve problems

1714
00:28:48,649 --> 00:28:48,659
that that will that will solve problems
 

1715
00:28:48,659 --> 00:28:50,029
that that will that will solve problems
in different spaces so not just

1716
00:28:50,029 --> 00:28:50,039
in different spaces so not just
 

1717
00:28:50,039 --> 00:28:51,590
in different spaces so not just
three-dimensional space this goes back

1718
00:28:51,590 --> 00:28:51,600

00:30:51,529 --> 00:30:51,539
said in many ways the cells are
 

1835
00:30:51,539 --> 00:30:54,470
said in many ways the cells are
discovering new ways of being but at the

00:30:54,470 --> 00:30:54,480
discovering new ways of being but at the
 

1837
00:30:54,480 --> 00:30:56,389
discovering new ways of being but at the

this so so evolution is very good at

1840
00:30:59,029 --> 00:30:59,039
this so so evolution is very good at
 

1841
00:30:59,039 --> 00:31:00,649
this so so evolution is very good at
this agential bioengineering right when

00:31:00,659 --> 00:31:03,350
this agential bioengineering right when
evolution is uh discovering a new way of

00:31:03,350 --> 00:31:03,360
evolution is uh discovering a new way of
 

1845
00:31:03,360 --> 00:31:04,850
evolution is uh discovering a new way of
being an animal yet one animal or a

00:31:04,850 --> 00:31:04,860
being an animal yet one animal or a
 

1847
00:31:04,860 --> 00:31:07,070
being an animal yet one animal or a
plant or something sometimes it's by

plant or something sometimes it's by
 

1849
00:31:07,080 --> 00:31:08,570
plant or something sometimes it's by
changing the hardware you know protein

1850
00:31:08,570 --> 00:31:08,580
changing the hardware you know protein
 

1851
00:31:08,580 --> 00:31:10,549
changing the hardware you know protein
changing proteins protein structure and

1852
00:31:10,549 --> 00:31:10,559
changing proteins protein structure and
 

1853
00:31:10,559 --> 00:31:12,889
changing proteins protein structure and
so on but much of the time it's not by

1854
00:31:12,889 --> 00:31:12,899
so on but much of the time it's not by
 

1855
00:31:12,899 --> 00:31:14,269
so on but much of the time it's not by
changing the hardware it's by changing

1856
00:31:14,269 --> 00:31:14,279
changing the hardware it's by changing
 

1857
00:31:14,279 --> 00:31:15,710
changing the hardware it's by changing
the signals that the cells give to each

the signals that the cells give to each
 

1859
00:31:15,720 --> 00:31:17,570
the signals that the cells give to each
other it's doing what we as Engineers do

1860
00:31:17,570 --> 00:31:17,580
other it's doing what we as Engineers do
 

1861
00:31:17,580 --> 00:31:19,190
other it's doing what we as Engineers do
which is try to convince the cells to do

1862
00:31:19,190 --> 00:31:19,200
which is try to convince the cells to do
 

1863
00:31:19,200 --> 00:31:20,750
which is try to convince the cells to do
various things by using signals

1864
00:31:20,750 --> 00:31:20,760
various things by using signals
 

1865
00:31:20,760 --> 00:31:22,730

organism you're not dealing with a

1876
00:31:32,450 --> 00:31:32,460
organism you're not dealing with a
 

1877
00:31:32,460 --> 00:31:34,789
organism you're not dealing with a
passive material that is is fresh and

1878
00:31:34,789 --> 00:31:34,799
passive material that is is fresh and
 

1879
00:31:34,799 --> 00:31:36,649
passive material that is is fresh and
you have to specify it already wants to

1880
00:31:36,649 --> 00:31:36,659
you have to specify it already wants to
 

1881
00:31:36,659 --> 00:31:38,330
you have to specify it already wants to
do certain things so the easiest way to

1882
00:31:38,330 --> 00:31:38,340
do certain things so the easiest way to
 

1883
00:31:38,340 --> 00:31:40,490
do certain things so the easiest way to
do that search to find whatever is going

1884
00:31:40,490 --> 00:31:40,500
do that search to find whatever is going
 

1885
00:31:40,500 --> 00:31:42,529
do that search to find whatever is going
to be adaptive is to find the signals

1886
00:31:42,529 --> 00:31:42,539
to be adaptive is to find the signals
 

1887
00:31:42,539 --> 00:31:44,870
to be adaptive is to find the signals
that are going to um convince cells to

1888
00:31:44,870 --> 00:31:44,880
that are going to um convince cells to
 

1889
00:31:44,880 --> 00:31:46,789
that are going to um convince cells to
do various things right

1890
00:31:46,789 --> 00:31:46,799
do various things right
 

1891
00:31:46,799 --> 00:31:48,649
do various things right
your sense is that Evolution operates

1892
00:31:48,649 --> 00:31:48,659
your sense is that Evolution operates
 

1893
00:31:48,659 --> 00:31:50,810
your sense is that Evolution operates
both in the software and the hardware

1894
00:31:50,810 --> 00:31:50,820
both in the software and the hardware
 

1895
00:31:50,820 --> 00:31:53,750
both in the software and the hardware
and it's just easier more efficient to

1896
00:31:53,750 --> 00:31:53,760
and it's just easier more efficient to
 

1897
00:31:53,760 --> 00:31:55,970
and it's just easier more efficient to
operate in the software yes and I should

1898
00:31:55,970 --> 00:31:55,980
operate in the software yes and I should
 

1899
00:31:55,980 --> 00:31:57,590
operate in the software yes and I should
also say I I don't think the distinction

1900
00:31:57,590 --> 00:31:57,600
also say I I don't think the distinction
 

1901
00:31:57,600 --> 00:31:59,510
also say I I don't think the distinction
is sharp in other words I think it's a

1902
00:31:59,510 --> 00:31:59,520
is sharp in other words I think it's a
 

1903
00:31:59,520 --> 00:32:01,430
is sharp in other words I think it's a
Continuum but I think we can but I think

1904
00:32:01,430 --> 00:32:01,440
Continuum but I think we can but I think
 

1905
00:32:01,440 --> 00:32:03,169
Continuum but I think we can but I think
it's a meaningful distinction where you

1906
00:32:03,169 --> 00:32:03,179
it's a meaningful distinction where you
 

1907
00:32:03,179 --> 00:32:05,810
it's a meaningful distinction where you
can make changes to a particular protein

1908
00:32:05,810 --> 00:32:05,820
can make changes to a particular protein
 

1909
00:32:05,820 --> 00:32:07,370
can make changes to a particular protein
and now the enzymatic function is

1910
00:32:07,370 --> 00:32:07,380
and now the enzymatic function is
 

1911
00:32:07,380 --> 00:32:08,990
and now the enzymatic function is
different and it metabolizes differently

1912
00:32:08,990 --> 00:32:09,000
different and it metabolizes differently
 

1913
00:32:09,000 --> 00:32:10,070
different and it metabolizes differently
and whatever and that will have

1914
00:32:10,070 --> 00:32:10,080
and whatever and that will have
 

1915
00:32:10,080 --> 00:32:12,950
and whatever and that will have
implications for Fitness or you can

1916
00:32:12,950 --> 00:32:12,960
implications for Fitness or you can
 

1917
00:32:12,960 --> 00:32:15,710
implications for Fitness or you can
change the huge

1918
00:32:15,710 --> 00:32:15,720
change the huge
 

1919
00:32:15,720 --> 00:32:17,630
change the huge
um amount of information in the genome

1920
00:32:17,630 --> 00:32:17,640
um amount of information in the genome
 

1921
00:32:17,640 --> 00:32:19,789
um amount of information in the genome
that isn't structural at all it's it's

1922
00:32:19,789 --> 00:32:19,799
that isn't structural at all it's it's
 

1923
00:32:19,799 --> 00:32:21,769
that isn't structural at all it's it's
uh it's signaling it's when and how do

1924
00:32:21,769 --> 00:32:21,779
uh it's signaling it's when and how do
 

1925
00:32:21,779 --> 00:32:23,210
uh it's signaling it's when and how do
cells say certain things to each other

1926
00:32:23,210 --> 00:32:23,220
cells say certain things to each other
 

1927
00:32:23,220 --> 00:32:25,730
cells say certain things to each other
and that can have massive changes as far

1928
00:32:25,730 --> 00:32:25,740
and that can have massive changes as far
 

1929
00:32:25,740 --> 00:32:27,289
and that can have massive changes as far
as how it's going to solve problems I

1930
00:32:27,289 --> 00:32:27,299
as how it's going to solve problems I
 

1931
00:32:27,299 --> 00:32:29,149
as how it's going to solve problems I
mean this idea of multi-hierarchical

1932
00:32:29,149 --> 00:32:29,159
mean this idea of multi-hierarchical
 

1933
00:32:29,159 --> 00:32:31,070
mean this idea of multi-hierarchical
competence architecture which is

1934
00:32:31,070 --> 00:32:31,080
competence architecture which is
 

1935
00:32:31,080 --> 00:32:34,010
competence architecture which is
incredible to think about so this

1936
00:32:34,010 --> 00:32:34,020
incredible to think about so this
 

1937
00:32:34,020 --> 00:32:37,370
incredible to think about so this
hierarchy that Evolution builds I don't

1938
00:32:37,370 --> 00:32:37,380
hierarchy that Evolution builds I don't
 

1939
00:32:37,380 --> 00:32:39,470
hierarchy that Evolution builds I don't
know who's responsible for this

1940
00:32:39,470 --> 00:32:39,480
know who's responsible for this
 

1941
00:32:39,480 --> 00:32:42,529
know who's responsible for this
I also see the incompetence of

1942
00:32:42,529 --> 00:32:42,539
I also see the incompetence of
 

1943
00:32:42,539 --> 00:32:45,710
I also see the incompetence of
bureaucracies of humans when they get

1944
00:32:45,710 --> 00:32:45,720
bureaucracies of humans when they get
 

1945
00:32:45,720 --> 00:32:47,149
bureaucracies of humans when they get
together

1946
00:32:47,149 --> 00:32:47,159
together
 

1947
00:32:47,159 --> 00:32:49,549
together
so how the hell does evolution build

1948
00:32:49,549 --> 00:32:49,559
so how the hell does evolution build
 

1949
00:32:49,559 --> 00:32:51,409
so how the hell does evolution build
this where

1950
00:32:51,409 --> 00:32:51,419
this where
 

1951
00:32:51,419 --> 00:32:54,529
this where
at every level only the best get to

1952
00:32:54,529 --> 00:32:54,539
at every level only the best get to
 

1953
00:32:54,539 --> 00:32:56,269
at every level only the best get to
stick around they somehow figure out how

1954
00:32:56,269 --> 00:32:56,279
stick around they somehow figure out how
 

1955
00:32:56,279 --> 00:32:57,769
stick around they somehow figure out how
to do their job without knowing the

1956
00:32:57,769 --> 00:32:57,779
to do their job without knowing the
 

1957
00:32:57,779 --> 00:32:59,090
to do their job without knowing the
bigger picture

1958
00:32:59,090 --> 00:32:59,100
bigger picture
 

1959
00:32:59,100 --> 00:33:01,909
bigger picture
and then there's like the bosses that do

1960
00:33:01,909 --> 00:33:01,919
and then there's like the bosses that do
 

1961
00:33:01,919 --> 00:33:03,289
and then there's like the bosses that do
the bigger thing

1962
00:33:03,289 --> 00:33:03,299
the bigger thing
 

1963
00:33:03,299 --> 00:33:06,049
the bigger thing
somehow or that you can now abstract

1964
00:33:06,049 --> 00:33:06,059
somehow or that you can now abstract
 

1965
00:33:06,059 --> 00:33:09,649
somehow or that you can now abstract
away the small group of cells as a as an

1966
00:33:09,649 --> 00:33:09,659
away the small group of cells as a as an
 

1967
00:33:09,659 --> 00:33:11,630
away the small group of cells as a as an
organ or something and then that organ

1968
00:33:11,630 --> 00:33:11,640
organ or something and then that organ
 

1969
00:33:11,640 --> 00:33:14,330
organ or something and then that organ
does something bigger

1970
00:33:14,330 --> 00:33:14,340
does something bigger
 

1971
00:33:14,340 --> 00:33:16,310
does something bigger
in the context of the full body or

1972
00:33:16,310 --> 00:33:16,320
in the context of the full body or
 

1973
00:33:16,320 --> 00:33:17,810
in the context of the full body or
something like this

1974
00:33:17,810 --> 00:33:17,820
something like this
 

1975
00:33:17,820 --> 00:33:20,210
something like this
how is that built is there some

1976
00:33:20,210 --> 00:33:20,220
how is that built is there some
 

1977
00:33:20,220 --> 00:33:23,269
how is that built is there some
intuition you can kind of provide of how

1978
00:33:23,269 --> 00:33:23,279
intuition you can kind of provide of how
 

1979
00:33:23,279 --> 00:33:24,889
intuition you can kind of provide of how
that's constructed that that

1980
00:33:24,889 --> 00:33:24,899
that's constructed that that
 

1981
00:33:24,899 --> 00:33:28,549
that's constructed that that
hierarchical confidence architecture

1982
00:33:28,549 --> 00:33:28,559
hierarchical confidence architecture
 

1983
00:33:28,559 --> 00:33:30,289
hierarchical confidence architecture
I love that confidence just the word

1984
00:33:30,289 --> 00:33:30,299
I love that confidence just the word
 

1985
00:33:30,299 --> 00:33:31,789
I love that confidence just the word
confidence is pretty cool in this

1986
00:33:31,789 --> 00:33:31,799
confidence is pretty cool in this
 

1987
00:33:31,799 --> 00:33:33,110
confidence is pretty cool in this
context because everybody's good at

1988
00:33:33,110 --> 00:33:33,120
context because everybody's good at
 

1989
00:33:33,120 --> 00:33:35,330
context because everybody's good at
their job somehow yeah no it's really

1990
00:33:35,330 --> 00:33:35,340
their job somehow yeah no it's really
 

1991
00:33:35,340 --> 00:33:36,710
their job somehow yeah no it's really
key and the other nice thing about

1992
00:33:36,710 --> 00:33:36,720
key and the other nice thing about
 

1993
00:33:36,720 --> 00:33:39,350
key and the other nice thing about
competency is that so so my my central

1994
00:33:39,350 --> 00:33:39,360
competency is that so so my my central
 

1995
00:33:39,360 --> 00:33:41,230
competency is that so so my my central
belief in all of this is that

1996
00:33:41,230 --> 00:33:41,240
belief in all of this is that
 

1997
00:33:41,240 --> 00:33:43,490
belief in all of this is that
engineering is the right perspective on

1998
00:33:43,490 --> 00:33:43,500
engineering is the right perspective on
 

1999
00:33:43,500 --> 00:33:44,870
engineering is the right perspective on
all of this stuff because it gets you

2000
00:33:44,870 --> 00:33:44,880
all of this stuff because it gets you
 

2001
00:33:44,880 --> 00:33:48,830
all of this stuff because it gets you
away from uh subjective uh terms you

2002
00:33:48,830 --> 00:33:48,840
away from uh subjective uh terms you
 

2003
00:33:48,840 --> 00:33:50,509
away from uh subjective uh terms you
know people talk about sentience and

2004
00:33:50,509 --> 00:33:50,519
know people talk about sentience and
 

2005
00:33:50,519 --> 00:33:52,430
know people talk about sentience and
this and that those things very hard to

2006
00:33:52,430 --> 00:33:52,440
this and that those things very hard to
 

2007
00:33:52,440 --> 00:33:53,930
this and that those things very hard to
define or people argue about them

2008
00:33:53,930 --> 00:33:53,940
define or people argue about them
 

2009
00:33:53,940 --> 00:33:57,289
define or people argue about them
philosophically I think that engineering

2010
00:33:57,289 --> 00:33:57,299
philosophically I think that engineering
 

2011
00:33:57,299 --> 00:33:59,870
philosophically I think that engineering
terms like competency like um you know

2012
00:33:59,870 --> 00:33:59,880
terms like competency like um you know
 

2013
00:33:59,880 --> 00:34:02,570
terms like competency like um you know
pursuit of goals right all of these

2014
00:34:02,570 --> 00:34:02,580
pursuit of goals right all of these
 

2015
00:34:02,580 --> 00:34:05,029
pursuit of goals right all of these
things are uh are empirically incredibly

2016
00:34:05,029 --> 00:34:05,039
things are uh are empirically incredibly
 

2017
00:34:05,039 --> 00:34:06,350
things are uh are empirically incredibly
useful because you know it when you see

2018
00:34:06,350 --> 00:34:06,360
useful because you know it when you see
 

2019
00:34:06,360 --> 00:34:08,810
useful because you know it when you see
it and if it helps you build right if I

2020
00:34:08,810 --> 00:34:08,820
it and if it helps you build right if I
 

2021
00:34:08,820 --> 00:34:11,450
it and if it helps you build right if I
if I can pick the right level I say uh

2022
00:34:11,450 --> 00:34:11,460
if I can pick the right level I say uh
 

2023
00:34:11,460 --> 00:34:13,369
if I can pick the right level I say uh
this thing has I believe this is X level

2024
00:34:13,369 --> 00:34:13,379
this thing has I believe this is X level
 

2025
00:34:13,379 --> 00:34:15,710
this thing has I believe this is X level
of like con if you competency I think

2026
00:34:15,710 --> 00:34:15,720
of like con if you competency I think
 

2027
00:34:15,720 --> 00:34:17,389
of like con if you competency I think
it's like a thermostat or I think it's

2028
00:34:17,389 --> 00:34:17,399
it's like a thermostat or I think it's
 

2029
00:34:17,399 --> 00:34:19,550
it's like a thermostat or I think it's
like a a better thermostat or I think

2030
00:34:19,550 --> 00:34:19,560
like a a better thermostat or I think
 

2031
00:34:19,560 --> 00:34:22,730
like a a better thermostat or I think
it's a you know a a various other kinds

2032
00:34:22,730 --> 00:34:22,740

it's a you know a a various other kinds

control and and predict and build such
 

2039
00:34:28,260 --> 00:34:30,050

about so so I like competency in that

2044
00:34:33,230 --> 00:34:33,240
about so so I like competency in that
 

2045
00:34:33,240 --> 00:34:34,490
about so so I like competency in that
way because you can quantify you could

2046
00:34:34,490 --> 00:34:34,500
way because you can quantify you could
 

2047
00:34:34,500 --> 00:34:35,750
way because you can quantify you could
you have to in fact you have to you have

2048
00:34:35,750 --> 00:34:35,760
you have to in fact you have to you have
 

2049
00:34:35,760 --> 00:34:37,550
you have to in fact you have to you have
to make a claim competent at what and

00:34:37,550 --> 00:34:37,560
to make a claim competent at what and
 

2051
00:34:37,560 --> 00:34:39,230
to make a claim competent at what and
then or if I say if I tell you it has a

00:34:39,230 --> 00:34:39,240
then or if I say if I tell you it has a
 

2053
00:34:39,240 --> 00:34:40,970
then or if I say if I tell you it has a
goal the question is what's the goal and

00:34:40,970 --> 00:34:40,980
goal the question is what's the goal and
 

2055
00:34:40,980 --> 00:34:42,349
goal the question is what's the goal and
how do you know and I say well because

2056
00:34:42,349 --> 00:34:42,359
how do you know and I say well because
 

2057
00:34:42,359 --> 00:34:43,970
how do you know and I say well because

2063
00:34:47,040 --> 00:34:48,230
energy to get back to that's the goal
and we can quantify and we can be

00:36:50,520 --> 00:36:51,829
and to become to go from a tadpole head
to a frog head you have to rearrange the

2188
00:36:51,829 --> 00:36:51,839
to a frog head you have to rearrange the
 

2189
00:36:51,839 --> 00:36:53,270
to a frog head you have to rearrange the
face so the eyes have to move forward

2190
00:36:53,270 --> 00:36:53,280
face so the eyes have to move forward
 

2191
00:36:53,280 --> 00:36:54,470
face so the eyes have to move forward
the Jaws have to to come out the

2192
00:36:54,470 --> 00:36:54,480
the Jaws have to to come out the
 

2193
00:36:54,480 --> 00:36:56,690
the Jaws have to to come out the
nostrils move like everything moves it

2194
00:36:56,690 --> 00:36:56,700
nostrils move like everything moves it
 

2195
00:36:56,700 --> 00:36:58,430
nostrils move like everything moves it
used to be thought that because all

2196
00:36:58,430 --> 00:36:58,440
used to be thought that because all
 

2197
00:36:58,440 --> 00:36:59,870
used to be thought that because all
tadpoles look the same and all frogs

2198
00:36:59,870 --> 00:36:59,880
tadpoles look the same and all frogs
 

2199
00:36:59,880 --> 00:37:01,130
tadpoles look the same and all frogs
look the same if you just remember if

2200
00:37:01,130 --> 00:37:01,140
look the same if you just remember if
 

2201
00:37:01,140 --> 00:37:02,450
look the same if you just remember if
every piece just moves in the right

2202
00:37:02,450 --> 00:37:02,460
every piece just moves in the right
 

2203
00:37:02,460 --> 00:37:04,069
every piece just moves in the right
direction the right amount then you get

2204
00:37:04,069 --> 00:37:04,079
direction the right amount then you get
 

2205
00:37:04,079 --> 00:37:05,630
direction the right amount then you get
your you get your frog right so we

2206
00:37:05,630 --> 00:37:05,640
your you get your frog right so we
 

2207
00:37:05,640 --> 00:37:07,849
your you get your frog right so we
decided to test we I had this hypothesis

2208
00:37:07,849 --> 00:37:07,859
decided to test we I had this hypothesis
 

2209
00:37:07,859 --> 00:37:09,170
decided to test we I had this hypothesis
that I thought I thought actually the

2210
00:37:09,170 --> 00:37:09,180
that I thought I thought actually the
 

2211
00:37:09,180 --> 00:37:10,550
that I thought I thought actually the
system is probably more intelligent than

2212
00:37:10,550 --> 00:37:10,560
system is probably more intelligent than
 

2213
00:37:10,560 --> 00:37:12,829
system is probably more intelligent than
that so what did we do we made what we

2214
00:37:12,829 --> 00:37:12,839
that so what did we do we made what we
 

2215
00:37:12,839 --> 00:37:14,750
that so what did we do we made what we
call Picasso tadpoles so these are so

2216
00:37:14,750 --> 00:37:14,760
call Picasso tadpoles so these are so
 

2217
00:37:14,760 --> 00:37:16,069
call Picasso tadpoles so these are so
everything is scramble so the eyes are

2218
00:37:16,069 --> 00:37:16,079
everything is scramble so the eyes are
 

2219
00:37:16,079 --> 00:37:17,210
everything is scramble so the eyes are
on the back of the head their jaws are

2220
00:37:17,210 --> 00:37:17,220
on the back of the head their jaws are
 

2221
00:37:17,220 --> 00:37:18,470
on the back of the head their jaws are
off to the side everything is scrambled

2222
00:37:18,470 --> 00:37:18,480
off to the side everything is scrambled
 

2223
00:37:18,480 --> 00:37:19,609
off to the side everything is scrambled
well guess what they make they make

2224
00:37:19,609 --> 00:37:19,619
well guess what they make they make
 

2225
00:37:19,619 --> 00:37:21,589
well guess what they make they make
pretty normal frogs because all the

2226
00:37:21,589 --> 00:37:21,599
pretty normal frogs because all the
 

2227
00:37:21,599 --> 00:37:23,690
pretty normal frogs because all the
different things move around in novel

2228

the correct froggy sort of frog face

2232
00:37:28,010 --> 00:37:28,020
the correct froggy sort of frog face
 

2233
00:37:28,020 --> 00:37:30,650
the correct froggy sort of frog face
configuration then they stop so so the

2234
00:37:30,650 --> 00:37:30,660
configuration then they stop so so the
 

2235
00:37:30,660 --> 00:37:31,670

Evolution right so so you make some sort

2238
00:37:34,490 --> 00:37:34,500
Evolution right so so you make some sort
 

2239
00:37:34,500 --> 00:37:37,730
Evolution right so so you make some sort
of mutation and it does like every

2240
00:37:37,730 --> 00:37:37,740
of mutation and it does like every
 

2241
00:37:37,740 --> 00:37:39,230
of mutation and it does like every
mutation it does many things so so

2242
00:37:39,230 --> 00:37:39,240
mutation it does many things so so
 

2243
00:37:39,240 --> 00:37:41,329
mutation it does many things so so
something good comes of it but also it

reason it works one of the reasons it
 

2275
00:38:06,660 --> 00:38:09,349
reason it works one of the reasons it
works so well is because you do that no

2276
00:38:09,349 --> 00:38:09,359
works so well is because you do that no

where where it belongs right so now you

2280
00:38:12,890 --> 00:38:12,900
where where it belongs right so now you
 

2281
00:38:12,900 --> 00:38:14,510
where where it belongs right so now you
get to explore so so what that means is

2282
00:38:14,510 --> 00:38:14,520
get to explore so so what that means is
 

2283
00:38:14,520 --> 00:38:16,430
get to explore so so what that means is
that all these mutations that otherwise

2284
00:38:16,430 --> 00:38:16,440
that all these mutations that otherwise
 

2285
00:38:16,440 --> 00:38:17,930
that all these mutations that otherwise
would be deleterious are now neutral

2286
00:38:17,930 --> 00:38:17,940

00:38:41,810 --> 00:38:41,820
own goals in various spaces usually with
 

2309
00:38:41,820 --> 00:38:44,150

very little regard for the welfare of
 

2311
00:38:44,160 --> 00:38:46,190
very little regard for the welfare of
the other levels so so as a simple

2312
00:38:46,190 --> 00:38:46,200
the other levels so so as a simple
 

2313
00:38:46,200 --> 00:38:47,569
the other levels so so as a simple
example you know

2314
00:38:47,569 --> 00:38:47,579
example you know
 

2315
00:38:47,579 --> 00:38:49,790
example you know
um you as a as a complex system

2316
00:38:49,790 --> 00:38:49,800
um you as a as a complex system
 

2317
00:38:49,800 --> 00:38:51,589
um you as a as a complex system
um you will go out and you will do you

2318
00:38:51,589 --> 00:38:51,599
um you will go out and you will do you
 

2319
00:38:51,599 --> 00:38:53,030
um you will go out and you will do you
know Jiu Jitsu or whatever you'll have

2323
00:38:55,079 --> 00:38:56,690
some to go rock climbing scrape a bunch
of cells off your hands and then you're

2324
00:38:56,690 --> 00:38:56,700
of cells off your hands and then you're
 

2325
00:38:56,700 --> 00:38:58,069
of cells off your hands and then you're
happy as a system right you come back

2326
00:38:58,069 --> 00:38:58,079
happy as a system right you come back
 

2327
00:38:58,079 --> 00:38:59,630
happy as a system right you come back
and you've you've accomplished some

2328
00:38:59,630 --> 00:38:59,640
and you've you've accomplished some
 

2329
00:38:59,640 --> 00:39:00,890
and you've you've accomplished some
goals and you're really happy those

2330
00:39:00,890 --> 00:39:00,900
goals and you're really happy those
 

2331
00:39:00,900 --> 00:39:02,690
goals and you're really happy those
cells are dead they're gone right did

2332
00:39:02,690 --> 00:39:02,700
cells are dead they're gone right did
 

2333
00:39:02,700 --> 00:39:04,069
cells are dead they're gone right did
you think about those cells not really

2334
00:39:04,069 --> 00:39:04,079
you think about those cells not really
 

2335
00:39:04,079 --> 00:39:05,569
you think about those cells not really
right you had some you had some bruising

2336
00:39:05,569 --> 00:39:05,579
right you had some you had some bruising
 

2337
00:39:05,579 --> 00:39:09,290
right you had some you had some bruising
out selfish SLB that's it and so and so

2338
00:39:09,290 --> 00:39:09,300
out selfish SLB that's it and so and so
 

2339
00:39:09,300 --> 00:39:11,510
out selfish SLB that's it and so and so
that's the thing to remember is that

2340
00:39:11,510 --> 00:39:11,520
that's the thing to remember is that
 

2341
00:39:11,520 --> 00:39:12,950
that's the thing to remember is that

history is that is that just being a
collective isn't enough because uh what

00:39:18,530 --> 00:39:18,540
collective isn't enough because uh what

00:39:18,540 --> 00:39:19,910
collective isn't enough because uh what
the goals of that Collective will be

00:39:19,910 --> 00:39:19,920
the goals of that Collective will be
 

2349
00:39:19,920 --> 00:39:21,050
the goals of that Collective will be
relative to the welfare of the

Stalin was on to something no that's the
 

2357
00:39:28,260 --> 00:39:29,930
Stalin was on to something no that's the
danger but we can exactly that's the

00:39:29,930 --> 00:39:29,940
danger but we can exactly that's the
 

2359
00:39:29,940 --> 00:39:31,849
danger but we can exactly that's the

00:39:34,310 --> 00:39:34,320
for us humans we have to construct

ethical systems
 

2365
00:39:36,420 --> 00:39:40,310
ethical systems
under which we don't take seriously the

00:39:40,310 --> 00:39:40,320
under which we don't take seriously the
 

2367
00:39:40,320 --> 00:39:42,470
under which we don't take seriously the
full mechanism of biology and apply it

00:39:42,470 --> 00:39:42,480
full mechanism of biology and apply it
 

2369
00:39:42,480 --> 00:39:44,569
full mechanism of biology and apply it
to the way the world functions which is

00:39:44,569 --> 00:39:44,579
to the way the world functions which is
 

2371
00:39:44,579 --> 00:39:48,050
to the way the world functions which is
which is an interesting line we've drawn

2372
00:39:48,050 --> 00:39:48,060
which is an interesting line we've drawn
 

2373
00:39:48,060 --> 00:39:50,450
which is an interesting line we've drawn
the world that built us

2374
00:39:50,450 --> 00:39:50,460
the world that built us
 

2375
00:39:50,460 --> 00:39:54,290
the world that built us
is the one we reject in some sense when

2376
00:39:54,290 --> 00:39:54,300
is the one we reject in some sense when
 

2377
00:39:54,300 --> 00:39:57,470
is the one we reject in some sense when
we construct human societies the idea

2378
00:39:57,470 --> 00:39:57,480
we construct human societies the idea
 

2379
00:39:57,480 --> 00:39:59,750
we construct human societies the idea
that this country was founded on that

2380
00:39:59,750 --> 00:39:59,760
that this country was founded on that
 

2381
00:39:59,760 --> 00:40:02,329
that this country was founded on that
all men are created equal that's such a

2382
00:40:02,329 --> 00:40:02,339
all men are created equal that's such a
 

2383
00:40:02,339 --> 00:40:05,390
all men are created equal that's such a
fascinating idea it's like uh you're

2384
00:40:05,390 --> 00:40:05,400
fascinating idea it's like uh you're
 

2385
00:40:05,400 --> 00:40:07,010
fascinating idea it's like uh you're
fighting against

2386
00:40:07,010 --> 00:40:07,020
fighting against
 

2387
00:40:07,020 --> 00:40:08,450
fighting against
nature

2388
00:40:08,450 --> 00:40:08,460
nature
 

2389
00:40:08,460 --> 00:40:09,770
nature
and you're saying well there's something

2390
00:40:09,770 --> 00:40:09,780
and you're saying well there's something
 

2391
00:40:09,780 --> 00:40:14,030
and you're saying well there's something
bigger here than um yeah a hierarchical

2392
00:40:14,030 --> 00:40:14,040
bigger here than um yeah a hierarchical
 

2393
00:40:14,040 --> 00:40:17,390
bigger here than um yeah a hierarchical
competency architecture yeah uh but

2394
00:40:17,390 --> 00:40:17,400
competency architecture yeah uh but
 

2395
00:40:17,400 --> 00:40:19,370
competency architecture yeah uh but
there's so many interesting things you

2396
00:40:19,370 --> 00:40:19,380
there's so many interesting things you
 

2397
00:40:19,380 --> 00:40:21,430
there's so many interesting things you
said so from an algorithmic perspective

2398
00:40:21,430 --> 00:40:21,440
said so from an algorithmic perspective
 

2399
00:40:21,440 --> 00:40:26,810
said so from an algorithmic perspective
the act of bending the option space

2400
00:40:26,810 --> 00:40:26,820

 

2401
00:40:26,820 --> 00:40:29,030

that's really that's really profound

2402
00:40:29,030 --> 00:40:29,040
that's really that's really profound
 

2403
00:40:29,040 --> 00:40:31,910
that's really that's really profound
because if you look at the way AI

2404
00:40:31,910 --> 00:40:31,920
because if you look at the way AI
 

2405
00:40:31,920 --> 00:40:34,550
because if you look at the way AI
systems are built today there's a big

2406
00:40:34,550 --> 00:40:34,560
systems are built today there's a big
 

2407
00:40:34,560 --> 00:40:37,730
systems are built today there's a big
system like I said with robots and as a

2408
00:40:37,730 --> 00:40:37,740
system like I said with robots and as a
 

2409
00:40:37,740 --> 00:40:40,190
system like I said with robots and as a
goal and he gets better and better at

2410
00:40:40,190 --> 00:40:40,200
goal and he gets better and better at
 

2411
00:40:40,200 --> 00:40:41,870
goal and he gets better and better at
optimizing that goal at accomplishing

2412
00:40:41,870 --> 00:40:41,880
optimizing that goal at accomplishing
 

2413
00:40:41,880 --> 00:40:45,470
optimizing that goal at accomplishing
that goal but if biology built a

2414
00:40:45,470 --> 00:40:45,480
that goal but if biology built a
 

2415
00:40:45,480 --> 00:40:48,290
that goal but if biology built a
hierarchical system where everything is

2416
00:40:48,290 --> 00:40:48,300
hierarchical system where everything is
 

2417
00:40:48,300 --> 00:40:50,089
hierarchical system where everything is
doing computation

2418
00:40:50,089 --> 00:40:50,099
doing computation
 

2419
00:40:50,099 --> 00:40:52,250
doing computation
and everything is accomplishing the goal

2420
00:40:52,250 --> 00:40:52,260
and everything is accomplishing the goal
 

2421
00:40:52,260 --> 00:40:53,930
and everything is accomplishing the goal
not only that

2422
00:40:53,930 --> 00:40:53,940
not only that
 

2423
00:40:53,940 --> 00:40:57,109
not only that
it's kind of dumb

2424
00:40:57,109 --> 00:40:57,119
it's kind of dumb
 

2425
00:40:57,119 --> 00:41:00,589
it's kind of dumb
you know with the uh with the limited

2426
00:41:00,589 --> 00:41:00,599
you know with the uh with the limited
 

2427
00:41:00,599 --> 00:41:02,569
you know with the uh with the limited
with the bent option space it's just

2428
00:41:02,569 --> 00:41:02,579
with the bent option space it's just
 

2429
00:41:02,579 --> 00:41:04,430
with the bent option space it's just
doing the thing that's the easiest thing

2430
00:41:04,430 --> 00:41:04,440
doing the thing that's the easiest thing
 

2431
00:41:04,440 --> 00:41:08,089
doing the thing that's the easiest thing
for it in some sense and somehow that

2432
00:41:08,089 --> 00:41:08,099
for it in some sense and somehow that
 

2433
00:41:08,099 --> 00:41:10,250
for it in some sense and somehow that
allows you to have

2434
00:41:10,250 --> 00:41:10,260
allows you to have
 

2435
00:41:10,260 --> 00:41:12,589
allows you to have
um Turtles on top of turtles literally

2436
00:41:12,589 --> 00:41:12,599
um Turtles on top of turtles literally
 

2437
00:41:12,599 --> 00:41:15,950
um Turtles on top of turtles literally
dump systems on top of dump systems that

2438
00:41:15,950 --> 00:41:15,960
dump systems on top of dump systems that
 

2439
00:41:15,960 --> 00:41:17,750
dump systems on top of dump systems that
as a whole create something incredibly

2440
00:41:17,750 --> 00:41:17,760
as a whole create something incredibly
 

2441
00:41:17,760 --> 00:41:21,170
as a whole create something incredibly
smart yeah I mean every system is has

2442
00:41:21,170 --> 00:41:21,180
smart yeah I mean every system is has
 

2443
00:41:21,180 --> 00:41:23,450
smart yeah I mean every system is has
some degree of intelligence in its own

2444
00:41:23,450 --> 00:41:23,460
some degree of intelligence in its own
 

2445
00:41:23,460 --> 00:41:27,470
some degree of intelligence in its own
problem domain so so cells will have

2446
00:41:27,470 --> 00:41:27,480
problem domain so so cells will have
 

2447
00:41:27,480 --> 00:41:28,670
problem domain so so cells will have
problems they're trying to solve in

2448
00:41:28,670 --> 00:41:28,680
problems they're trying to solve in
 

2449
00:41:28,680 --> 00:41:30,530
problems they're trying to solve in
physiological space and transcriptional

00:41:30,530 --> 00:41:30,540
physiological space and transcriptional
 

2451
00:41:30,540 --> 00:41:31,609
physiological space and transcriptional
space and then I could give you some

2452
00:41:31,609 --> 00:41:31,619
space and then I could give you some
 

2453
00:41:31,619 --> 00:41:33,650
space and then I could give you some
some cool examples of that but the

2454
00:41:33,650 --> 00:41:33,660
some cool examples of that but the
 

2455
00:41:33,660 --> 00:41:35,329
some cool examples of that but the
collective is trying to solve problems

2456
00:41:35,329 --> 00:41:35,339
collective is trying to solve problems
 

2457
00:41:35,339 --> 00:41:37,609
collective is trying to solve problems
in anatomical space right and forming a

00:41:39,000 --> 00:41:41,210
you know a creature and growing your
blood vessels and so on and then the

00:41:41,210 --> 00:41:41,220
blood vessels and so on and then the
 

2463
00:41:41,220 --> 00:41:43,609
blood vessels and so on and then the
collect the the the the whole body is

00:41:47,220 --> 00:41:48,950
in Social space and linguistic space in
three-dimensional space and and who

00:41:48,950 --> 00:41:48,960
three-dimensional space and and who
 

2471
00:41:48,960 --> 00:41:50,270

00:41:50,270 --> 00:41:50,280
knows you know the group might be
 

2473
00:41:50,280 --> 00:41:52,190
knows you know the group might be
solving problems and and um you know I

2474
00:41:52,190 --> 00:41:52,200
solving problems and and um you know I
 

2475
00:41:52,200 --> 00:41:53,390
solving problems and and um you know I
don't know some sort of financial space

2476
00:41:53,390 --> 00:41:53,400
don't know some sort of financial space
 

2477
00:41:53,400 --> 00:41:56,270
don't know some sort of financial space
or something so one of the major

2478
00:41:56,270 --> 00:41:56,280
or something so one of the major
 

2479
00:41:56,280 --> 00:41:58,790
or something so one of the major
differences with with most

2480
00:41:58,790 --> 00:41:58,800
differences with with most
 

2481
00:41:58,800 --> 00:42:03,050
differences with with most
um uh with most AIS today is is a the

2482
00:42:03,050 --> 00:42:03,060
um uh with most AIS today is is a the
 

2483
00:42:03,060 --> 00:42:05,329
um uh with most AIS today is is a the
the kind of flatness of the architecture

2484
00:42:05,329 --> 00:42:05,339
the kind of flatness of the architecture
 

2485
00:42:05,339 --> 00:42:07,670
the kind of flatness of the architecture
but also of the fact that they're

2486
00:42:07,670 --> 00:42:07,680
but also of the fact that they're
 

2487
00:42:07,680 --> 00:42:09,410
but also of the fact that they're
constructed

2488
00:42:09,410 --> 00:42:09,420
constructed
 

2489
00:42:09,420 --> 00:42:12,349
constructed
from outside their their borders and

2490
00:42:12,349 --> 00:42:12,359
from outside their their borders and
 

2491
00:42:12,359 --> 00:42:15,650
from outside their their borders and
their you know so so if you're so to a

2492
00:42:15,650 --> 00:42:15,660
their you know so so if you're so to a
 

2493
00:42:15,660 --> 00:42:16,849
their you know so so if you're so to a
large extent and of course there are

2494
00:42:16,849 --> 00:42:16,859
large extent and of course there are
 

2495
00:42:16,859 --> 00:42:18,710
large extent and of course there are
counter examples now but but to a large

2496
00:42:18,710 --> 00:42:18,720
counter examples now but but to a large
 

2497
00:42:18,720 --> 00:42:20,510
counter examples now but but to a large
extent our technology has been such that

2498
00:42:20,510 --> 00:42:20,520
extent our technology has been such that
 

2499
00:42:20,520 --> 00:42:22,849
extent our technology has been such that
you create a machine or a robot it knows

2500
00:42:22,849 --> 00:42:22,859
you create a machine or a robot it knows
 

2501
00:42:22,859 --> 00:42:25,609
you create a machine or a robot it knows
what its sensors are it knows what its

2502
00:42:25,609 --> 00:42:25,619
what its sensors are it knows what its
 

2503
00:42:25,619 --> 00:42:27,050
what its sensors are it knows what its
effectors are it knows the boundary

2504
00:42:27,050 --> 00:42:27,060
effectors are it knows the boundary
 

2505
00:42:27,060 --> 00:42:28,550
effectors are it knows the boundary
between it and the outside world all

2506
00:42:28,550 --> 00:42:28,560
between it and the outside world all
 

2507
00:42:28,560 --> 00:42:30,230
between it and the outside world all
this is given from the outside

2508
00:42:30,230 --> 00:42:30,240
this is given from the outside

00:42:30,240 --> 00:42:32,510
this is given from the outside
biology constructs this from scratch now

2510
00:42:32,510 --> 00:42:32,520
biology constructs this from scratch now
 

2511
00:42:32,520 --> 00:42:34,329
biology constructs this from scratch now
the best example of this that that

2512
00:42:34,329 --> 00:42:34,339
the best example of this that that
 

2513
00:42:34,339 --> 00:42:37,430
the best example of this that that
originally uh in in robotics was

2514
00:42:37,430 --> 00:42:37,440
originally uh in in robotics was
 

2515
00:42:37,440 --> 00:42:39,290
originally uh in in robotics was
actually Josh bongard's work in 2006

2516
00:42:39,290 --> 00:42:39,300
actually Josh bongard's work in 2006
 

2517
00:42:39,300 --> 00:42:41,030
actually Josh bongard's work in 2006
where he made these these robots that

2518
00:42:41,030 --> 00:42:41,040
where he made these these robots that
 

2519
00:42:41,040 --> 00:42:42,650
where he made these these robots that
did not know their shape to start with

2520
00:42:42,650 --> 00:42:42,660
did not know their shape to start with
 

2521
00:42:42,660 --> 00:42:44,329
did not know their shape to start with
so like a baby these are floundered

2522
00:42:44,329 --> 00:42:44,339
so like a baby these are floundered
 

2523
00:42:44,339 --> 00:42:46,069
so like a baby these are floundered
around they made some hypotheses well I

2524
00:42:46,069 --> 00:42:46,079
around they made some hypotheses well I
 

2525
00:42:46,079 --> 00:42:47,810
around they made some hypotheses well I
did this and I moved in this way well

2526
00:42:47,810 --> 00:42:47,820
did this and I moved in this way well
 

2527
00:42:47,820 --> 00:42:49,970
did this and I moved in this way well
maybe I'm a whatever maybe I have wheels

2528
00:42:49,970 --> 00:42:49,980
maybe I'm a whatever maybe I have wheels
 

2529
00:42:49,980 --> 00:42:51,230
maybe I'm a whatever maybe I have wheels
or maybe I have six legs or whatever

2530
00:42:51,230 --> 00:42:51,240
or maybe I have six legs or whatever
 

2531
00:42:51,240 --> 00:42:52,370
or maybe I have six legs or whatever
right and they would make a model and

2532
00:42:52,370 --> 00:42:52,380
right and they would make a model and
 

2533
00:42:52,380 --> 00:42:53,810
right and they would make a model and
eventually they would crawl around so

2534
00:42:53,810 --> 00:42:53,820
eventually they would crawl around so
 

2535
00:42:53,820 --> 00:42:55,190
eventually they would crawl around so
that's I mean that's really good that's

2536
00:42:55,190 --> 00:42:55,200
that's I mean that's really good that's
 

2537
00:42:55,200 --> 00:42:57,109
that's I mean that's really good that's
part of the autopoiesis but we can go a

2538
00:42:57,109 --> 00:42:57,119
part of the autopoiesis but we can go a
 

2539
00:42:57,119 --> 00:42:58,550
part of the autopoiesis but we can go a
step further and some people are doing

2540
00:42:58,550 --> 00:42:58,560
step further and some people are doing
 

2541
00:42:58,560 --> 00:43:00,349
step further and some people are doing
this and then we're sort of working on

2542
00:43:00,349 --> 00:43:00,359
this and then we're sort of working on
 

2543
00:43:00,359 --> 00:43:02,450
this and then we're sort of working on
some of this too is this idea that let's

2544
00:43:02,450 --> 00:43:02,460
some of this too is this idea that let's
 

2545
00:43:02,460 --> 00:43:04,370
some of this too is this idea that let's
even go back further you don't even know

2546
00:43:04,370 --> 00:43:04,380
even go back further you don't even know
 

2547
00:43:04,380 --> 00:43:05,690
even go back further you don't even know
what sensors you have you don't know

00:43:05,690 --> 00:43:05,700
what sensors you have you don't know
 

2549
00:43:05,700 --> 00:43:07,190
what sensors you have you don't know
where you end and the outside world

2550
00:43:07,190 --> 00:43:07,200
where you end and the outside world
 

2551
00:43:07,200 --> 00:43:09,890
where you end and the outside world
begins all you have is is certain things

00:43:09,890 --> 00:43:09,900
begins all you have is is certain things
 

2553
00:43:09,900 --> 00:43:11,150
begins all you have is is certain things
like active inference meaning you're

2554
00:43:11,150 --> 00:43:11,160
like active inference meaning you're
 

2555
00:43:11,160 --> 00:43:13,190
like active inference meaning you're
trying to minimize surprise right you

trying to minimize surprise right you
have some metabolic constraints you

2558
00:43:14,630 --> 00:43:14,640
have some metabolic constraints you
 

2559
00:43:14,640 --> 00:43:15,890
have some metabolic constraints you
don't have all the energy you need you

don't have all the energy you need you
 

2561
00:43:15,900 --> 00:43:17,150
don't have all the energy you need you
don't have all the time in the world to

to think about everything you want to
 

2565
00:43:18,599 --> 00:43:20,270
to think about everything you want to
think about so that means that you can't

2566
00:43:20,270 --> 00:43:20,280
think about so that means that you can't
 

2567
00:43:20,280 --> 00:43:21,890
think about so that means that you can't
afford to be a micro

00:43:21,890 --> 00:43:21,900
afford to be a micro
 

2569

um reductionist you know all this data

2570
00:43:23,390 --> 00:43:23,400
um reductionist you know all this data
 

2571
00:43:23,400 --> 00:43:25,130
um reductionist you know all this data
coming in you have to coarse grain it

2572
00:43:25,130 --> 00:43:25,140
coming in you have to coarse grain it
 

2573
00:43:25,140 --> 00:43:26,270
coming in you have to coarse grain it
and say I'm going to take all this stuff

2574
00:43:26,270 --> 00:43:26,280
and say I'm going to take all this stuff
 

2575
00:43:26,280 --> 00:43:27,710
and say I'm going to take all this stuff
and I'm going to call that a cat I'm

and I'm going to call that a cat I'm
 

2577
00:43:27,720 --> 00:43:28,730
and I'm going to call that a cat I'm
gonna take all this I'm going to call

2578
00:43:28,730 --> 00:43:28,740
gonna take all this I'm going to call
 

2579

gonna take all this I'm going to call
that the edge of the table I don't want

2580
00:43:29,930 --> 00:43:29,940
that the edge of the table I don't want
 

2581
00:43:29,940 --> 00:43:31,550
that the edge of the table I don't want
to follow off of and I don't want to

00:43:31,550 --> 00:43:31,560
to follow off of and I don't want to
 

2583
00:43:31,560 --> 00:43:32,990
to follow off of and I don't want to
know anything about the microstates what

2584
00:43:32,990 --> 00:43:33,000
know anything about the microstates what
 

2585
00:43:33,000 --> 00:43:34,790
know anything about the microstates what
I want to know is what is the optimal

2586
00:43:34,790 --> 00:43:34,800
I want to know is what is the optimal
 

2587
00:43:34,800 --> 00:43:36,349
I want to know is what is the optimal
way to cut up my world and by the way

2588
00:43:36,349 --> 00:43:36,359
way to cut up my world and by the way
 

2589
00:43:36,359 --> 00:43:38,089
way to cut up my world and by the way
this thing over here that's me and the

2590
00:43:38,089 --> 00:43:38,099
this thing over here that's me and the
 

2591
00:43:38,099 --> 00:43:39,589
this thing over here that's me and the
reason that's me is because I have more

2592
00:43:39,589 --> 00:43:39,599
reason that's me is because I have more
 

2593
00:43:39,599 --> 00:43:41,210
reason that's me is because I have more
control over this than I have over any

2594
00:43:41,210 --> 00:43:41,220
control over this than I have over any
 

2595
00:43:41,220 --> 00:43:42,890
control over this than I have over any
of this other stuff and so now you can

2596
00:43:42,890 --> 00:43:42,900
of this other stuff and so now you can
 

2597
00:43:42,900 --> 00:43:43,970
of this other stuff and so now you can
begin to write so that's

2598
00:43:43,970 --> 00:43:43,980
begin to write so that's
 

2599
00:43:43,980 --> 00:43:45,950
begin to write so that's

2654
00:44:41,690 --> 00:44:41,700
world around you as having agency and
 

2655
00:44:41,700 --> 00:44:42,950
world around you as having agency and
then you turn that on yourself and you

2656
00:44:42,950 --> 00:44:42,960
then you turn that on yourself and you
 

2657
00:44:42,960 --> 00:44:44,870
then you turn that on yourself and you
say wait I have agency too I can I do

2658
00:44:44,870 --> 00:44:44,880
say wait I have agency too I can I do
 

2659
00:44:44,880 --> 00:44:46,790
say wait I have agency too I can I do
things right and and then you make

2660
00:44:46,790 --> 00:44:46,800
things right and and then you make
 

2661
00:44:46,800 --> 00:44:47,930
things right and and then you make
decisions about what you're going to do

2662
00:44:47,930 --> 00:44:47,940
decisions about what you're going to do
 

2663
00:44:47,940 --> 00:44:51,050
decisions about what you're going to do
so all of this one one model is to view

2664
00:44:51,050 --> 00:44:51,060
so all of this one one model is to view
 

2665
00:44:51,060 --> 00:44:53,630
so all of this one one model is to view
all of those kinds of things as

2666
00:44:53,630 --> 00:44:53,640
all of those kinds of things as
 

2667
00:44:53,640 --> 00:44:56,510
all of those kinds of things as
being driven by that early need to

2668
00:44:56,510 --> 00:44:56,520
being driven by that early need to
 

2669
00:44:56,520 --> 00:44:59,089
being driven by that early need to
determine what you are and to do so and

2670
00:44:59,089 --> 00:44:59,099
determine what you are and to do so and
 

2671
00:44:59,099 --> 00:45:00,770
determine what you are and to do so and
to then take actions in the most

2672
00:45:00,770 --> 00:45:00,780
to then take actions in the most
 

2673
00:45:00,780 --> 00:45:02,990
to then take actions in the most
energetically efficient space possible

2674
00:45:02,990 --> 00:45:03,000
energetically efficient space possible
 

2675
00:45:03,000 --> 00:45:05,690
energetically efficient space possible
right so free will emerges when you try

2676
00:45:05,690 --> 00:45:05,700
right so free will emerges when you try
 

2677
00:45:05,700 --> 00:45:08,390
right so free will emerges when you try
to simplify tell a nice narrative about

2678
00:45:08,390 --> 00:45:08,400
to simplify tell a nice narrative about
 

2679
00:45:08,400 --> 00:45:10,130
to simplify tell a nice narrative about
your environment I think that's very

2680
00:45:10,130 --> 00:45:10,140
your environment I think that's very
 

2681
00:45:10,140 --> 00:45:13,309
your environment I think that's very
possible yeah do you think free was an

2682
00:45:13,309 --> 00:45:13,319
possible yeah do you think free was an
 

2683
00:45:13,319 --> 00:45:14,630
possible yeah do you think free was an
illusion

2684
00:45:14,630 --> 00:45:14,640
illusion
 

2685
00:45:14,640 --> 00:45:17,390
illusion
so so you're kind of implying that it's

2686
00:45:17,390 --> 00:45:17,400
so so you're kind of implying that it's
 

2687
00:45:17,400 --> 00:45:19,309
so so you're kind of implying that it's
a useful hack

2688
00:45:19,309 --> 00:45:19,319
a useful hack
 

2689
00:45:19,319 --> 00:45:21,410
a useful hack
well I'll say two things the first thing

2690
00:45:21,410 --> 00:45:21,420
well I'll say two things the first thing
 

2691
00:45:21,420 --> 00:45:22,970
well I'll say two things the first thing
is I think I think it's very plausible

2692
00:45:22,970 --> 00:45:22,980
is I think I think it's very plausible
 

2693
00:45:22,980 --> 00:45:26,329
is I think I think it's very plausible
to say that any organism that's self or

2694
00:45:26,329 --> 00:45:26,339
to say that any organism that's self or
 

2695
00:45:26,339 --> 00:45:28,550
to say that any organism that's self or
any agent that's self whether it's

2696
00:45:28,550 --> 00:45:28,560
any agent that's self whether it's
 

2697
00:45:28,560 --> 00:45:30,849
any agent that's self whether it's
biological or not any agent that

2698
00:45:30,849 --> 00:45:30,859
biological or not any agent that
 

2699
00:45:30,859 --> 00:45:33,530
biological or not any agent that
self-constructs under energy constraints

2700
00:45:33,530 --> 00:45:33,540
self-constructs under energy constraints
 

2701
00:45:33,540 --> 00:45:36,230
self-constructs under energy constraints
is going to believe in free will but

2702
00:45:36,230 --> 00:45:36,240
is going to believe in free will but
 

2703
00:45:36,240 --> 00:45:37,609
is going to believe in free will but
we'll get to whether it has free will

2704
00:45:37,609 --> 00:45:37,619
we'll get to whether it has free will
 

2705
00:45:37,619 --> 00:45:39,349
we'll get to whether it has free will
momentarily but but I think but I think

2706
00:45:39,349 --> 00:45:39,359
momentarily but but I think but I think
 

2707
00:45:39,359 --> 00:45:41,210
momentarily but but I think but I think
what what it definitely drives is a view

2708
00:45:41,210 --> 00:45:41,220
what what it definitely drives is a view
 

2709
00:45:41,220 --> 00:45:42,950
what what it definitely drives is a view
of yourself and the outside world as an

2710
00:45:42,950 --> 00:45:42,960
of yourself and the outside world as an
 

2711
00:45:42,960 --> 00:45:44,569
of yourself and the outside world as an
agential view I think that's inescapable

2712
00:45:44,569 --> 00:45:44,579
agential view I think that's inescapable
 

2713
00:45:44,579 --> 00:45:47,030
agential view I think that's inescapable
so that's true for even primitive

2714
00:45:47,030 --> 00:45:47,040
so that's true for even primitive
 

2715
00:45:47,040 --> 00:45:49,250
so that's true for even primitive
organisms I think so I think that's now

2716
00:45:49,250 --> 00:45:49,260
organisms I think so I think that's now
 

2717
00:45:49,260 --> 00:45:50,870
organisms I think so I think that's now
now they don't have now obviously you

2718
00:45:50,870 --> 00:45:50,880
now they don't have now obviously you
 

2719
00:45:50,880 --> 00:45:52,550
now they don't have now obviously you
have to scale down right so so so so

2720
00:45:52,550 --> 00:45:52,560
have to scale down right so so so so
 

2721
00:45:52,560 --> 00:45:54,829
have to scale down right so so so so
they don't have for the kinds of complex

2722
00:45:54,829 --> 00:45:54,839
they don't have for the kinds of complex
 

2723
00:45:54,839 --> 00:45:56,569
they don't have for the kinds of complex
metacognition that we have so they can

2724
00:45:56,569 --> 00:45:56,579
metacognition that we have so they can
 

2725
00:45:56,579 --> 00:45:58,069
metacognition that we have so they can
do long-term planning and thinking about

2726
00:45:58,069 --> 00:45:58,079
do long-term planning and thinking about
 

2727
00:45:58,079 --> 00:46:00,589
do long-term planning and thinking about
Free Will and so and so on but but the

2728
00:46:00,589 --> 00:46:00,599
Free Will and so and so on but but the
 

2729
00:46:00,599 --> 00:46:02,630
Free Will and so and so on but but the
sense of agency is really useful to

2730
00:46:02,630 --> 00:46:02,640
sense of agency is really useful to
 

2731
00:46:02,640 --> 00:46:04,970
sense of agency is really useful to
accomplish a tasks simple or complicated

2732
00:46:04,970 --> 00:46:04,980
accomplish a tasks simple or complicated
 

2733
00:46:04,980 --> 00:46:06,710
accomplish a tasks simple or complicated
that's right in in all kinds of spaces

2734
00:46:06,710 --> 00:46:06,720
that's right in in all kinds of spaces
 

2735
00:46:06,720 --> 00:46:08,809
that's right in in all kinds of spaces
not just in in obvious three-dimensional

2736
00:46:08,809 --> 00:46:08,819
not just in in obvious three-dimensional
 

2737
00:46:08,819 --> 00:46:10,250
not just in in obvious three-dimensional
space I mean we're very good that the

2738
00:46:10,250 --> 00:46:10,260
space I mean we're very good that the
 

2739
00:46:10,260 --> 00:46:11,349
space I mean we're very good that the
thing is

2740
00:46:11,349 --> 00:46:11,359
thing is
 

2741
00:46:11,359 --> 00:46:13,849
thing is
humans are very good at detecting agency

2742
00:46:13,849 --> 00:46:13,859
humans are very good at detecting agency
 

2743
00:46:13,859 --> 00:46:17,450
humans are very good at detecting agency
of like medium-sized objects moving at

2744
00:46:17,450 --> 00:46:17,460
of like medium-sized objects moving at
 

2745
00:46:17,460 --> 00:46:18,890
of like medium-sized objects moving at
medium speeds in the three-dimensional

2746
00:46:18,890 --> 00:46:18,900
medium speeds in the three-dimensional
 

2747
00:46:18,900 --> 00:46:20,630
medium speeds in the three-dimensional
world right we see a bowling ball and we

2748
00:46:20,630 --> 00:46:20,640
world right we see a bowling ball and we
 

2749
00:46:20,640 --> 00:46:22,010
world right we see a bowling ball and we
see a mouse and we immediately know what

2750
00:46:22,010 --> 00:46:22,020
see a mouse and we immediately know what
 

2751
00:46:22,020 --> 00:46:23,150
see a mouse and we immediately know what
the difference is right and how we're

2752
00:46:23,150 --> 00:46:23,160
the difference is right and how we're
 

2753
00:46:23,160 --> 00:46:25,190
the difference is right and how we're
gonna mostly things you can eat or get

2754
00:46:25,190 --> 00:46:25,200
gonna mostly things you can eat or get
 

2755
00:46:25,200 --> 00:46:27,589
gonna mostly things you can eat or get
eaten by yeah yeah that's our that's our

2756
00:46:27,589 --> 00:46:27,599
eaten by yeah yeah that's our that's our
 

2757
00:46:27,599 --> 00:46:28,790
eaten by yeah yeah that's our that's our
training set right from the time you're

2758
00:46:28,790 --> 00:46:28,800
training set right from the time you're
 

2759
00:46:28,800 --> 00:46:30,530
training set right from the time you're
little your training set is visual data

2760
00:46:30,530 --> 00:46:30,540
little your training set is visual data
 

2761
00:46:30,540 --> 00:46:32,569
little your training set is visual data
on on this this like little chunk of

2762
00:46:32,569 --> 00:46:32,579
on on this this like little chunk of
 

2763
00:46:32,579 --> 00:46:34,790
on on this this like little chunk of
your experience but imagine if imagine

2764
00:46:34,790 --> 00:46:34,800
your experience but imagine if imagine
 

2765
00:46:34,800 --> 00:46:37,430
your experience but imagine if imagine
if uh from the time that we were born we

2766
00:46:37,430 --> 00:46:37,440
if uh from the time that we were born we
 

2767
00:46:37,440 --> 00:46:39,349
if uh from the time that we were born we
had innate senses of your blood

2768
00:46:39,349 --> 00:46:39,359
had innate senses of your blood
 

2769
00:46:39,359 --> 00:46:40,790
had innate senses of your blood
chemistry if you could feel your blood

2770
00:46:40,790 --> 00:46:40,800
chemistry if you could feel your blood
 

2771
00:46:40,800 --> 00:46:42,349
chemistry if you could feel your blood
chemistry the way you can see right you

2772
00:46:42,349 --> 00:46:42,359
chemistry the way you can see right you
 

2773
00:46:42,359 --> 00:46:44,089
chemistry the way you can see right you
had a high bandwidth connection and you

2774
00:46:44,089 --> 00:46:44,099
had a high bandwidth connection and you
 

2775
00:46:44,099 --> 00:46:45,349
had a high bandwidth connection and you
could feel your blood chemistry and you

2776
00:46:45,349 --> 00:46:45,359
could feel your blood chemistry and you
 

2777
00:46:45,359 --> 00:46:47,210
could feel your blood chemistry and you
could see you could sense all the things

2778
00:46:47,210 --> 00:46:47,220
could see you could sense all the things
 

2779
00:46:47,220 --> 00:46:48,770
could see you could sense all the things
that your organs were doing so your

2780
00:46:48,770 --> 00:46:48,780
that your organs were doing so your
 

2781
00:46:48,780 --> 00:46:50,750
that your organs were doing so your
pancreas your liver all the things if if

2782
00:46:50,750 --> 00:46:50,760
pancreas your liver all the things if if
 

2783
00:46:50,760 --> 00:46:53,210
pancreas your liver all the things if if
we had that you we would be very good at

2784
00:46:53,210 --> 00:46:53,220
we had that you we would be very good at
 

2785
00:46:53,220 --> 00:46:54,950
we had that you we would be very good at
detecting intelligence and physiological

2786
00:46:54,950 --> 00:46:54,960
detecting intelligence and physiological
 

2787
00:46:54,960 --> 00:46:57,530
detecting intelligence and physiological
space we would know the level of

2788
00:46:57,530 --> 00:46:57,540
space we would know the level of
 

2789
00:46:57,540 --> 00:46:58,970
space we would know the level of
intelligence that our various organs

2790
00:46:58,970 --> 00:46:58,980
intelligence that our various organs
 

2791
00:46:58,980 --> 00:47:00,650
intelligence that our various organs
were deploying to deal with things that

2792
00:47:00,650 --> 00:47:00,660
were deploying to deal with things that
 

2793
00:47:00,660 --> 00:47:02,569
were deploying to deal with things that
were coming to anticipate the stimuli to

2794
00:47:02,569 --> 00:47:02,579
were coming to anticipate the stimuli to
 

2795
00:47:02,579 --> 00:47:04,370
were coming to anticipate the stimuli to
you know but but we're just terrible at

2796
00:47:04,370 --> 00:47:04,380
you know but but we're just terrible at
 

2797
00:47:04,380 --> 00:47:05,569
you know but but we're just terrible at
that we don't in fact in fact people

2798
00:47:05,569 --> 00:47:05,579
that we don't in fact in fact people
 

2799
00:47:05,579 --> 00:47:07,250
that we don't in fact in fact people
don't even you know you talk about

2800
00:47:07,250 --> 00:47:07,260
don't even you know you talk about
 

2801
00:47:07,260 --> 00:47:09,230
don't even you know you talk about
intelligence to these other spaces and a

2802
00:47:09,230 --> 00:47:09,240
intelligence to these other spaces and a
 

2803
00:47:09,240 --> 00:47:10,069
intelligence to these other spaces and a
lot of people think that's just crazy

2804
00:47:10,069 --> 00:47:10,079
lot of people think that's just crazy
 

2805
00:47:10,079 --> 00:47:12,290
lot of people think that's just crazy
because because all all we're all we

2806
00:47:12,290 --> 00:47:12,300
because because all all we're all we
 

2807
00:47:12,300 --> 00:47:14,390
because because all all we're all we
know is motion we do have access to that

2808
00:47:14,390 --> 00:47:14,400
know is motion we do have access to that
 

2809
00:47:14,400 --> 00:47:16,809
know is motion we do have access to that
information so it's actually possible

2810
00:47:16,809 --> 00:47:16,819
information so it's actually possible
 

2811
00:47:16,819 --> 00:47:19,609
information so it's actually possible
that uh so Evolution could if we wanted

2812
00:47:19,609 --> 00:47:19,619
that uh so Evolution could if we wanted
 

2813
00:47:19,619 --> 00:47:21,410
that uh so Evolution could if we wanted
to construct an organism that's able to

2814
00:47:21,410 --> 00:47:21,420
to construct an organism that's able to
 

2815
00:47:21,420 --> 00:47:24,290
to construct an organism that's able to
perceive the flow of blood through your

2816
00:47:24,290 --> 00:47:24,300
perceive the flow of blood through your
 

2817
00:47:24,300 --> 00:47:28,010
perceive the flow of blood through your
body the way you see an old friend and

2818
00:47:28,010 --> 00:47:28,020
body the way you see an old friend and
 

2819
00:47:28,020 --> 00:47:30,829
body the way you see an old friend and
say yo what's up how's the wife and the

2820
00:47:30,829 --> 00:47:30,839
say yo what's up how's the wife and the
 

2821
00:47:30,839 --> 00:47:33,290
say yo what's up how's the wife and the
kids uh in that same way you would see

2822
00:47:33,290 --> 00:47:33,300
kids uh in that same way you would see
 

2823
00:47:33,300 --> 00:47:35,750
kids uh in that same way you would see
that you would feel like a connection to

2824
00:47:35,750 --> 00:47:35,760
that you would feel like a connection to
 

2825
00:47:35,760 --> 00:47:38,390
that you would feel like a connection to
the liver yeah yeah I think you know

2826
00:47:38,390 --> 00:47:38,400
the liver yeah yeah I think you know
 

2827
00:47:38,400 --> 00:47:40,250
the liver yeah yeah I think you know
maybe other people's liver no just your

2828
00:47:40,250 --> 00:47:40,260
maybe other people's liver no just your
 

2829
00:47:40,260 --> 00:47:41,750
maybe other people's liver no just your
own because you don't have access to

2830
00:47:41,750 --> 00:47:41,760
own because you don't have access to
 

2831
00:47:41,760 --> 00:47:43,970
own because you don't have access to
other people's lives not yet but you

2832
00:47:43,970 --> 00:47:43,980
other people's lives not yet but you
 

2833
00:47:43,980 --> 00:47:45,349
other people's lives not yet but you
could imagine some really interesting

2834
00:47:45,349 --> 00:47:45,359
could imagine some really interesting
 

2835
00:47:45,359 --> 00:47:46,910
could imagine some really interesting
connection right but like sexual

2836
00:47:46,910 --> 00:47:46,920
connection right but like sexual
 

2837
00:47:46,920 --> 00:47:49,430
connection right but like sexual
selection like oh that girl's got a nice

2838
00:47:49,430 --> 00:47:49,440
selection like oh that girl's got a nice
 

2839
00:47:49,440 --> 00:47:52,130
selection like oh that girl's got a nice
liver well that's like the the way her

2840
00:47:52,130 --> 00:47:52,140
liver well that's like the the way her
 

2841
00:47:52,140 --> 00:47:55,130
liver well that's like the the way her

2844
00:47:55,849 --> 00:47:55,859
blood
 

2845
00:47:55,859 --> 00:47:58,250
blood
uh is very interesting it's novel I've

2846
00:47:58,250 --> 00:47:58,260
uh is very interesting it's novel I've
 

2847
00:47:58,260 --> 00:47:59,809
uh is very interesting it's novel I've
never seen one of those but you know

2848
00:47:59,809 --> 00:47:59,819
never seen one of those but you know
 

2849
00:47:59,819 --> 00:48:01,550
never seen one of those but you know
that's that's exactly what we're trying

2850
00:48:01,550 --> 00:48:01,560
that's that's exactly what we're trying
 

2851
00:48:01,560 --> 00:48:03,950
that's that's exactly what we're trying
to half-ass when we when we um uh judge

2852
00:48:03,950 --> 00:48:03,960
to half-ass when we when we um uh judge
 

2853
00:48:03,960 --> 00:48:05,990
to half-ass when we when we um uh judge
Judgment of beauty by facial Symmetry

2854
00:48:05,990 --> 00:48:06,000
Judgment of beauty by facial Symmetry
 

2855
00:48:06,000 --> 00:48:07,609
Judgment of beauty by facial Symmetry
and so on that's that's a half-assed

2856
00:48:07,609 --> 00:48:07,619
and so on that's that's a half-assed
 

2857
00:48:07,619 --> 00:48:09,410
and so on that's that's a half-assed
assessment of exactly that of exactly

2858
00:48:09,410 --> 00:48:09,420
assessment of exactly that of exactly
 

2859
00:48:09,420 --> 00:48:10,910
assessment of exactly that of exactly
that because if your cells could not

2860
00:48:10,910 --> 00:48:10,920
that because if your cells could not
 

2861
00:48:10,920 --> 00:48:12,650
that because if your cells could not
cooperate enough to keep your your

2862
00:48:12,650 --> 00:48:12,660
cooperate enough to keep your your
 

2863
00:48:12,660 --> 00:48:14,690
cooperate enough to keep your your
organism symmetrical yeah you know you

2864
00:48:14,690 --> 00:48:14,700
organism symmetrical yeah you know you
 

2865
00:48:14,700 --> 00:48:15,950
organism symmetrical yeah you know you
can make some inferences about what else

2866
00:48:15,950 --> 00:48:15,960
can make some inferences about what else
 

2867
00:48:15,960 --> 00:48:17,390
can make some inferences about what else
is wrong right like that's a that's a

2868
00:48:17,390 --> 00:48:17,400
is wrong right like that's a that's a
 

2869
00:48:17,400 --> 00:48:18,950
is wrong right like that's a that's a
very you know that's a very basic

2870
00:48:18,950 --> 00:48:18,960
very you know that's a very basic
 

2871
00:48:18,960 --> 00:48:21,710
very you know that's a very basic
interesting yeah so that in some deep

2872
00:48:21,710 --> 00:48:21,720
interesting yeah so that in some deep
 

2873
00:48:21,720 --> 00:48:24,170
interesting yeah so that in some deep
sense actually that is what we're doing

2874
00:48:24,170 --> 00:48:24,180
sense actually that is what we're doing
 

2875
00:48:24,180 --> 00:48:25,250
sense actually that is what we're doing
where

2876
00:48:25,250 --> 00:48:25,260
where
 

2877
00:48:25,260 --> 00:48:27,410
where
trying to infer

2878
00:48:27,410 --> 00:48:27,420
trying to infer
 

2879
00:48:27,420 --> 00:48:29,349
trying to infer
how

2880
00:48:29,349 --> 00:48:29,359
how
 

2881
00:48:29,359 --> 00:48:32,150
how
the health we use the word healthy but

2882
00:48:32,150 --> 00:48:32,160
the health we use the word healthy but
 

2883
00:48:32,160 --> 00:48:34,250
the health we use the word healthy but
basically how functional is this

2884
00:48:34,250 --> 00:48:34,260
basically how functional is this
 

2885
00:48:34,260 --> 00:48:37,010
basically how functional is this
biological system I'm looking at so I

2886
00:48:37,010 --> 00:48:37,020
biological system I'm looking at so I
 

2887
00:48:37,020 --> 00:48:40,490
biological system I'm looking at so I
can con hook up with that one and make

2888
00:48:40,490 --> 00:48:40,500
can con hook up with that one and make
 

2889
00:48:40,500 --> 00:48:42,770
can con hook up with that one and make
Offspring yeah yeah well what kind of

2890
00:48:42,770 --> 00:48:42,780
Offspring yeah yeah well what kind of
 

2891
00:48:42,780 --> 00:48:44,870
Offspring yeah yeah well what kind of
Hardware might their genomics give me

2892
00:48:44,870 --> 00:48:44,880
Hardware might their genomics give me
 

2893
00:48:44,880 --> 00:48:46,430
Hardware might their genomics give me
that that might be useful in the future

2894
00:48:46,430 --> 00:48:46,440
that that might be useful in the future
 

2895
00:48:46,440 --> 00:48:48,829
that that might be useful in the future
I wonder why Evolution didn't give us

2896
00:48:48,829 --> 00:48:48,839
I wonder why Evolution didn't give us
 

2897
00:48:48,839 --> 00:48:51,410
I wonder why Evolution didn't give us
um higher resolution signal like why the

2898
00:48:51,410 --> 00:48:51,420
um higher resolution signal like why the
 

2899
00:48:51,420 --> 00:48:54,470
um higher resolution signal like why the
whole peacock thing with the feathers it

2900
00:48:54,470 --> 00:48:54,480
whole peacock thing with the feathers it
 

2901
00:48:54,480 --> 00:48:56,569
whole peacock thing with the feathers it
doesn't seem

2902
00:48:56,569 --> 00:48:56,579
doesn't seem
 

2903
00:48:56,579 --> 00:48:59,450
doesn't seem
the very low bandwidth signal for sexual

2904
00:48:59,450 --> 00:48:59,460
the very low bandwidth signal for sexual
 

2905
00:48:59,460 --> 00:49:01,190
the very low bandwidth signal for sexual
selection I'm gonna and I'm not an

2906
00:49:01,190 --> 00:49:01,200
selection I'm gonna and I'm not an
 

2907
00:49:01,200 --> 00:49:03,109
selection I'm gonna and I'm not an
expert on on this stuff but on peacocks

2908
00:49:03,109 --> 00:49:03,119
expert on on this stuff but on peacocks
 

2909
00:49:03,119 --> 00:49:05,750
expert on on this stuff but on peacocks
well no you know but but I'll take a

2910
00:49:05,750 --> 00:49:05,760
well no you know but but I'll take a
 

2911
00:49:05,760 --> 00:49:08,030
well no you know but but I'll take a
stab at the reason I think that it's

2912
00:49:08,030 --> 00:49:08,040
stab at the reason I think that it's
 

2913
00:49:08,040 --> 00:49:10,069
stab at the reason I think that it's
because it's an arms race you see you

2914
00:49:10,069 --> 00:49:10,079
because it's an arms race you see you
 

2915
00:49:10,079 --> 00:49:11,329
because it's an arms race you see you
don't want everybody to know everything

2916
00:49:11,329 --> 00:49:11,339
don't want everybody to know everything
 

2917
00:49:11,339 --> 00:49:14,270
don't want everybody to know everything
about you so I think that as much as as

2918
00:49:14,270 --> 00:49:14,280
about you so I think that as much as as
 

2919
00:49:14,280 --> 00:49:15,950
about you so I think that as much as as
much as and in fact there's another

2920
00:49:15,950 --> 00:49:15,960
much as and in fact there's another
 

2921
00:49:15,960 --> 00:49:18,170
much as and in fact there's another
interesting part of this arms race which

2922
00:49:18,170 --> 00:49:18,180
interesting part of this arms race which
 

2923
00:49:18,180 --> 00:49:18,950
interesting part of this arms race which
is

2924
00:49:18,950 --> 00:49:18,960
is
 

2925
00:49:18,960 --> 00:49:21,829
is
if you think about this uh the the most

2926
00:49:21,829 --> 00:49:21,839
if you think about this uh the the most
 

2927
00:49:21,839 --> 00:49:24,470
if you think about this uh the the most
adaptive evolvable system is one that

2928
00:49:24,470 --> 00:49:24,480
adaptive evolvable system is one that
 

2929
00:49:24,480 --> 00:49:27,290
adaptive evolvable system is one that
has the most level of top-down control

2930
00:49:27,290 --> 00:49:27,300
has the most level of top-down control
 

2931
00:49:27,300 --> 00:49:29,630
has the most level of top-down control
right if it's really easy to say to a

00:49:29,630 --> 00:49:29,640
right if it's really easy to say to a
 

2933

that's a question I neglected to answer

2948
00:49:44,630 --> 00:49:44,640
that's a question I neglected to answer
 

2949
00:49:44,640 --> 00:49:46,849
that's a question I neglected to answer
about where the memory is and so on

2950
00:49:46,849 --> 00:49:46,859
about where the memory is and so on
 

2951
00:49:46,859 --> 00:49:49,309
about where the memory is and so on
um a system that uses all of that is

2952
00:49:49,309 --> 00:49:49,319
um a system that uses all of that is
 

2953
00:49:49,319 --> 00:49:50,750
um a system that uses all of that is
really highly evolvable and that's

2954
00:49:50,750 --> 00:49:50,760
really highly evolvable and that's
 

2955
00:49:50,760 --> 00:49:52,609
really highly evolvable and that's
fantastic but guess what it's also

00:50:00,170 --> 00:50:00,180
various kinds by con specifics like we
 

2963
00:50:00,180 --> 00:50:02,690
various kinds by con specifics like we
we found that um and then that that goes

2964
00:50:02,690 --> 00:50:02,700
we found that um and then that that goes
 

2965
00:50:02,700 --> 00:50:04,010
we found that um and then that that goes
back to the story of the pattern memory

2966
00:50:04,010 --> 00:50:04,020
back to the story of the pattern memory
 

2967
00:50:04,020 --> 00:50:05,450
back to the story of the pattern memory
these in these planaria there's a

2968
00:50:05,450 --> 00:50:05,460
these in these planaria there's a
 

2969
00:50:05,460 --> 00:50:07,069
these in these planaria there's a
bacterium that lives on these planaria

2970
00:50:07,069 --> 00:50:07,079
bacterium that lives on these planaria
 

2971
00:50:07,079 --> 00:50:09,410
bacterium that lives on these planaria
that bacterium has an input into how

2972
00:50:09,410 --> 00:50:09,420
that bacterium has an input into how
 

2973
00:50:09,420 --> 00:50:10,970
that bacterium has an input into how
many heads the worm is going to have

2974
00:50:10,970 --> 00:50:10,980
many heads the worm is going to have
 

2975
00:50:10,980 --> 00:50:13,550
many heads the worm is going to have
because it's hijacks that that control

2976
00:50:13,550 --> 00:50:13,560
because it's hijacks that that control
 

2977
00:50:13,560 --> 00:50:15,050
because it's hijacks that that control
system and it's able to make a chemical

2978
00:50:15,050 --> 00:50:15,060
system and it's able to make a chemical
 

2979
00:50:15,060 --> 00:50:17,329
system and it's able to make a chemical
that basically interfaces with the

2980
00:50:17,329 --> 00:50:17,339
that basically interfaces with the
 

2981
00:50:17,339 --> 00:50:18,589
that basically interfaces with the
system that calculates how many heads

2982
00:50:18,589 --> 00:50:18,599
system that calculates how many heads
 

2983
00:50:18,599 --> 00:50:19,430
system that calculates how many heads
you're supposed to have have and they

2984
00:50:19,430 --> 00:50:19,440
you're supposed to have have and they
 

2985
00:50:19,440 --> 00:50:20,510
you're supposed to have have and they
can have to and they can make them have

2986
00:50:20,510 --> 00:50:20,520
can have to and they can make them have
 

2987
00:50:20,520 --> 00:50:22,250
can have to and they can make them have
two heads and so you can imagine that if

2988
00:50:22,250 --> 00:50:22,260
two heads and so you can imagine that if
 

2989
00:50:22,260 --> 00:50:23,510
two heads and so you can imagine that if
you are two so you want to be

2990
00:50:23,510 --> 00:50:23,520
you are two so you want to be
 

2991
00:50:23,520 --> 00:50:25,069
you are two so you want to be
understandable for your own parts to

2992
00:50:25,069 --> 00:50:25,079
understandable for your own parts to
 

2993
00:50:25,079 --> 00:50:26,210
understandable for your own parts to
understand each other but you don't want

2994
00:50:26,210 --> 00:50:26,220
understand each other but you don't want
 

2995
00:50:26,220 --> 00:50:27,710
understand each other but you don't want
to be too understandable because you'll

2996
00:50:27,710 --> 00:50:27,720
to be too understandable because you'll
 

2997
00:50:27,720 --> 00:50:29,510
to be too understandable because you'll
be too easily controllable and so I

2998
00:50:29,510 --> 00:50:29,520
be too easily controllable and so I
 

2999
00:50:29,520 --> 00:50:32,390
be too easily controllable and so I
think that that my guess is that that

3000
00:50:32,390 --> 00:50:32,400
think that that my guess is that that
 

3001
00:50:32,400 --> 00:50:34,849
think that that my guess is that that
um that that that that opposing pressure

3002
00:50:34,849 --> 00:50:34,859
um that that that that opposing pressure
 

3003
00:50:34,859 --> 00:50:36,770
um that that that that opposing pressure
keeps this from being a super high

3004
00:50:36,770 --> 00:50:36,780
keeps this from being a super high
 

3005
00:50:36,780 --> 00:50:38,630
keeps this from being a super high
bandwidth kind of thing where we can

3006
00:50:38,630 --> 00:50:38,640
bandwidth kind of thing where we can
 

3007
00:50:38,640 --> 00:50:39,890
bandwidth kind of thing where we can
just look at somebody and know you know

3008
00:50:39,890 --> 00:50:39,900
just look at somebody and know you know
 

3009
00:50:39,900 --> 00:50:41,270
just look at somebody and know you know
everything about them so it's a kind of

3010
00:50:41,270 --> 00:50:41,280
everything about them so it's a kind of
 

3011
00:50:41,280 --> 00:50:43,849
everything about them so it's a kind of
biological game of Texas Hold'em yeah

3012
00:50:43,849 --> 00:50:43,859
biological game of Texas Hold'em yeah
 

3013
00:50:43,859 --> 00:50:45,410
biological game of Texas Hold'em yeah
he's showing some cards and you're

3014
00:50:45,410 --> 00:50:45,420
he's showing some cards and you're
 

3015
00:50:45,420 --> 00:50:47,750
he's showing some cards and you're
hiding other cards and that's part of it

3016
00:50:47,750 --> 00:50:47,760
hiding other cards and that's part of it
 

3017
00:50:47,760 --> 00:50:49,849
hiding other cards and that's part of it
and there's bluffing and there's and all

3018
00:50:49,849 --> 00:50:49,859
and there's bluffing and there's and all
 

3019
00:50:49,859 --> 00:50:52,190
and there's bluffing and there's and all
that and then just probably whole

3020
00:50:52,190 --> 00:50:52,200
that and then just probably whole
 

3021
00:50:52,200 --> 00:50:53,990
that and then just probably whole
species that would do way too much

3022
00:50:53,990 --> 00:50:54,000
species that would do way too much
 

3023
00:50:54,000 --> 00:50:55,549
species that would do way too much
bluffing that's probably where peacocks

3024
00:50:55,549 --> 00:50:55,559
bluffing that's probably where peacocks
 

3025
00:50:55,559 --> 00:50:58,730
bluffing that's probably where peacocks
fall I mean there's a there's a book

3026
00:50:58,730 --> 00:50:58,740
fall I mean there's a there's a book
 

3027
00:50:58,740 --> 00:51:01,910
fall I mean there's a there's a book
that I don't remember if I read or if I

3028
00:51:01,910 --> 00:51:01,920
that I don't remember if I read or if I
 

3029
00:51:01,920 --> 00:51:04,250
that I don't remember if I read or if I
if I wrote If I read summaries of the

3030
00:51:04,250 --> 00:51:04,260
if I wrote If I read summaries of the
 

3031
00:51:04,260 --> 00:51:06,410
if I wrote If I read summaries of the
book but it's about the evolution of

3032
00:51:06,410 --> 00:51:06,420
book but it's about the evolution of
 

3033
00:51:06,420 --> 00:51:09,410
book but it's about the evolution of
beauty and birds where is that from is

3034
00:51:09,410 --> 00:51:09,420
beauty and birds where is that from is
 

3035
00:51:09,420 --> 00:51:11,329
beauty and birds where is that from is
that a book or does Richard Dawkins talk

3036
00:51:11,329 --> 00:51:11,339
that a book or does Richard Dawkins talk
 

3037
00:51:11,339 --> 00:51:13,430
that a book or does Richard Dawkins talk
about it but basically there's some

3038
00:51:13,430 --> 00:51:13,440
about it but basically there's some
 

3039
00:51:13,440 --> 00:51:16,069
about it but basically there's some
species start to like over select for

3040
00:51:16,069 --> 00:51:16,079
species start to like over select for
 

3041
00:51:16,079 --> 00:51:18,470
species start to like over select for
beauty not overselect they just some

3042
00:51:18,470 --> 00:51:18,480
beauty not overselect they just some
 

3043
00:51:18,480 --> 00:51:20,630
beauty not overselect they just some
reason select for beauty there is a case

3044
00:51:20,630 --> 00:51:20,640
reason select for beauty there is a case
 

3045
00:51:20,640 --> 00:51:22,790
reason select for beauty there is a case
to be made actually now I'm starting to

3046
00:51:22,790 --> 00:51:22,800
to be made actually now I'm starting to
 

3047
00:51:22,800 --> 00:51:25,730
to be made actually now I'm starting to
remember I think Darwin himself made a

3048
00:51:25,730 --> 00:51:25,740
remember I think Darwin himself made a
 

3049
00:51:25,740 --> 00:51:28,190
remember I think Darwin himself made a
case that you can select based on beauty

3050
00:51:28,190 --> 00:51:28,200
case that you can select based on beauty
 

3051
00:51:28,200 --> 00:51:29,510
case that you can select based on beauty
alone

3052
00:51:29,510 --> 00:51:29,520
alone
 

3053
00:51:29,520 --> 00:51:33,109
alone
so yeah that beauty there's a point

3054
00:51:33,109 --> 00:51:33,119
so yeah that beauty there's a point
 

3055
00:51:33,119 --> 00:51:34,490
so yeah that beauty there's a point
would be it doesn't represent some

3056
00:51:34,490 --> 00:51:34,500
would be it doesn't represent some
 

3057
00:51:34,500 --> 00:51:37,130
would be it doesn't represent some
underlying biological truth you start to

3058
00:51:37,130 --> 00:51:37,140
underlying biological truth you start to
 

3059
00:51:37,140 --> 00:51:40,250
underlying biological truth you start to
select for for beauty itself and I think

3060
00:51:40,250 --> 00:51:40,260
select for for beauty itself and I think
 

3061
00:51:40,260 --> 00:51:42,290
select for for beauty itself and I think
the the Deep question is there is some

3062
00:51:42,290 --> 00:51:42,300
the the Deep question is there is some
 

3063
00:51:42,300 --> 00:51:45,230
the the Deep question is there is some
if is there some evolutionary value to

3064
00:51:45,230 --> 00:51:45,240
if is there some evolutionary value to
 

3065
00:51:45,240 --> 00:51:49,130
if is there some evolutionary value to
Beauty but that's an interesting kind of

3066
00:51:49,130 --> 00:51:49,140
Beauty but that's an interesting kind of
 

3067
00:51:49,140 --> 00:51:51,250
Beauty but that's an interesting kind of
thought that this

3068
00:51:51,250 --> 00:51:51,260
thought that this
 

3069
00:51:51,260 --> 00:51:54,950
thought that this
can we deviate completely from the deep

3070
00:51:54,950 --> 00:51:54,960
can we deviate completely from the deep
 

3071
00:51:54,960 --> 00:51:56,870
can we deviate completely from the deep
biological truth to actually appreciate

3072
00:51:56,870 --> 00:51:56,880
biological truth to actually appreciate
 

3073
00:51:56,880 --> 00:51:59,450
biological truth to actually appreciate
some kind of the the summarization

3074
00:51:59,450 --> 00:51:59,460
some kind of the the summarization
 

3075
00:51:59,460 --> 00:52:01,010
some kind of the the summarization
itself

3076
00:52:01,010 --> 00:52:01,020
itself
 

3077
00:52:01,020 --> 00:52:02,750
itself
let me get back to memory because that's

3078
00:52:02,750 --> 00:52:02,760
let me get back to memory because that's
 

3079
00:52:02,760 --> 00:52:04,730
let me get back to memory because that's
a really interesting idea

3080
00:52:04,730 --> 00:52:04,740
a really interesting idea
 

3081
00:52:04,740 --> 00:52:05,270
a really interesting idea
um

3082
00:52:05,270 --> 00:52:05,280
um
 

3083
00:52:05,280 --> 00:52:08,630
um
how do a collection of cells remember

3084
00:52:08,630 --> 00:52:08,640
how do a collection of cells remember
 

3085
00:52:08,640 --> 00:52:10,849
how do a collection of cells remember
anything how do biological systems

3086
00:52:10,849 --> 00:52:10,859
anything how do biological systems
 

3087
00:52:10,859 --> 00:52:13,910
anything how do biological systems
remember anything how is that akin to

3088
00:52:13,910 --> 00:52:13,920
remember anything how is that akin to
 

3089
00:52:13,920 --> 00:52:15,829
remember anything how is that akin to
the kind of memory we think of humans as

3090
00:52:15,829 --> 00:52:15,839
the kind of memory we think of humans as
 

3091
00:52:15,839 --> 00:52:18,470
the kind of memory we think of humans as
having within our big cognitive engine

3092
00:52:18,470 --> 00:52:18,480
having within our big cognitive engine
 

3093
00:52:18,480 --> 00:52:21,109
having within our big cognitive engine
yeah one of the ways to start thinking

3094
00:52:21,109 --> 00:52:21,119
yeah one of the ways to start thinking
 

3095
00:52:21,119 --> 00:52:23,290
yeah one of the ways to start thinking
about bioelectricity is to ask ourselves

3096
00:52:23,290 --> 00:52:23,300
about bioelectricity is to ask ourselves
 

3097
00:52:23,300 --> 00:52:26,510
about bioelectricity is to ask ourselves
where did neurons and all these cool

3098
00:52:26,510 --> 00:52:26,520
where did neurons and all these cool
 

3099
00:52:26,520 --> 00:52:30,650
where did neurons and all these cool
tricks that the brain uses to run these

3100
00:52:30,650 --> 00:52:30,660
tricks that the brain uses to run these
 

3101
00:52:30,660 --> 00:52:32,990
tricks that the brain uses to run these
amazing problem-solving abilities on and

3102
00:52:32,990 --> 00:52:33,000
amazing problem-solving abilities on and
 

3103
00:52:33,000 --> 00:52:34,910
amazing problem-solving abilities on and
basically an electrical Network right

3104
00:52:34,910 --> 00:52:34,920
basically an electrical Network right
 

3105
00:52:34,920 --> 00:52:36,109
basically an electrical Network right
where did that come from they didn't

3106
00:52:36,109 --> 00:52:36,119
where did that come from they didn't
 

3107
00:52:36,119 --> 00:52:37,609
where did that come from they didn't
just evolve you know up here out of

3108
00:52:37,609 --> 00:52:37,619
just evolve you know up here out of
 

3109
00:52:37,619 --> 00:52:38,630
just evolve you know up here out of
nowhere it must have evolved from

3110
00:52:38,630 --> 00:52:38,640
nowhere it must have evolved from
 

3111
00:52:38,640 --> 00:52:41,750
nowhere it must have evolved from
something and what it evolved from was a

3112
00:52:41,750 --> 00:52:41,760
something and what it evolved from was a
 

3113
00:52:41,760 --> 00:52:44,150
something and what it evolved from was a
much more ancient ability of cells to

3114
00:52:44,150 --> 00:52:44,160
much more ancient ability of cells to
 

3115
00:52:44,160 --> 00:52:46,069
much more ancient ability of cells to
form networks to solve other kinds of

3116
00:52:46,069 --> 00:52:46,079
form networks to solve other kinds of
 

3117
00:52:46,079 --> 00:52:47,870
form networks to solve other kinds of

3171
00:53:44,940 --> 00:53:46,690
work you have
I think

3172
00:53:46,690 --> 00:53:46,700
I think
 

3173
00:53:46,700 --> 00:53:49,549
I think
to a large degree uniquely maybe you can

3174
00:53:49,549 --> 00:53:49,559
to a large degree uniquely maybe you can
 

3175
00:53:49,559 --> 00:53:52,750
to a large degree uniquely maybe you can
correct me on that have focused on the

00:53:52,750 --> 00:53:52,760
correct me on that have focused on the
 

3177
00:53:52,760 --> 00:53:55,130
correct me on that have focused on the
bioelectricity which is using

bioelectricity which is using
 

3179
00:53:55,140 --> 00:53:57,770
bioelectricity which is using
electricity for signaling there's also

3180
00:53:57,770 --> 00:53:57,780
electricity for signaling there's also
 

3181
00:53:57,780 --> 00:54:00,290
electricity for signaling there's also
probably mechanical sure sure knocking

uh so what what what's the difference

3186
00:54:04,430 --> 00:54:04,440
uh so what what what's the difference
 

3187
00:54:04,440 --> 00:54:07,490
uh so what what what's the difference
and what's an electrical Network yeah so

3188
00:54:07,490 --> 00:54:07,500
and what's an electrical Network yeah so
 

3189
00:54:07,500 --> 00:54:09,170
and what's an electrical Network yeah so
I want to make sure and and kind of give

3190
00:54:09,170 --> 00:54:09,180
I want to make sure and and kind of give
 

3191
00:54:09,180 --> 00:54:11,450
I want to make sure and and kind of give
credit where creditors do so so as far

back as 1903 and probably

3194
00:54:13,910 --> 00:54:13,920
back as 1903 and probably
 

3195
00:54:13,920 --> 00:54:16,370
back as 1903 and probably
um late 1800s already people were

3196
00:54:16,370 --> 00:54:16,380
um late 1800s already people were
 

3197
00:54:16,380 --> 00:54:17,510
um late 1800s already people were
thinking about the importance of

3198
00:54:17,510 --> 00:54:17,520
thinking about the importance of
 

3199
00:54:17,520 --> 00:54:20,270
thinking about the importance of
electrical phenomena in in life so I'm

3200
00:54:20,270 --> 00:54:20,280
electrical phenomena in in life so I'm
 

3201
00:54:20,280 --> 00:54:22,069
electrical phenomena in in life so I'm
for sure not the first person to stress

3202
00:54:22,069 --> 00:54:22,079
for sure not the first person to stress
 

3203
00:54:22,079 --> 00:54:23,990
for sure not the first person to stress
the importance of electricity

3204
00:54:23,990 --> 00:54:24,000
the importance of electricity
 

3205
00:54:24,000 --> 00:54:25,849
the importance of electricity
um people there were there were waves of

3206
00:54:25,849 --> 00:54:25,859
um people there were there were waves of
 

3207
00:54:25,859 --> 00:54:28,790
um people there were there were waves of
research in the in the 30s in the 40s

3208
00:54:28,790 --> 00:54:28,800
research in the in the 30s in the 40s
 

3209
00:54:28,800 --> 00:54:32,270
research in the in the 30s in the 40s
and then again in the kind of uh 70s 80s

3210
00:54:32,270 --> 00:54:32,280
and then again in the kind of uh 70s 80s
 

3211
00:54:32,280 --> 00:54:34,490
and then again in the kind of uh 70s 80s
and 90s of of sort of the pioneers of

3212
00:54:34,490 --> 00:54:34,500
and 90s of of sort of the pioneers of
 

3213
00:54:34,500 --> 00:54:36,109
and 90s of of sort of the pioneers of
bioelectricity who did some amazing work

3214
00:54:36,109 --> 00:54:36,119
bioelectricity who did some amazing work
 

3215
00:54:36,119 --> 00:54:37,609
bioelectricity who did some amazing work
on all this I think I think what what

3216
00:54:37,609 --> 00:54:37,619
on all this I think I think what what
 

3217
00:54:37,619 --> 00:54:40,609
on all this I think I think what what
we've done that's new is to step away

3218
00:54:40,609 --> 00:54:40,619
we've done that's new is to step away
 

3219
00:54:40,619 --> 00:54:42,829
we've done that's new is to step away
from this idea that and I'll describe

3220
00:54:42,829 --> 00:54:42,839
from this idea that and I'll describe
 

3221
00:54:42,839 --> 00:54:44,329
from this idea that and I'll describe
what what the bioelectricity is is step

3222
00:54:44,329 --> 00:54:44,339
what what the bioelectricity is is step
 

3223
00:54:44,339 --> 00:54:45,890
what what the bioelectricity is is step
away from the idea that well here's

3224
00:54:45,890 --> 00:54:45,900
away from the idea that well here's
 

3225
00:54:45,900 --> 00:54:47,210
away from the idea that well here's
another piece of physics that you need

3226
00:54:47,210 --> 00:54:47,220
another piece of physics that you need
 

3227
00:54:47,220 --> 00:54:48,670
another piece of physics that you need
to keep track of to understand

3228
00:54:48,670 --> 00:54:48,680
to keep track of to understand
 

3229
00:54:48,680 --> 00:54:50,990
to keep track of to understand
physiology and development and to really

3230
00:54:50,990 --> 00:54:51,000
physiology and development and to really
 

3231
00:54:51,000 --> 00:54:53,150
physiology and development and to really
start looking at this as saying no this

3232
00:54:53,150 --> 00:54:53,160
start looking at this as saying no this
 

3233
00:54:53,160 --> 00:54:56,089
start looking at this as saying no this
is a a privileged computational layer

3234
00:54:56,089 --> 00:54:56,099
is a a privileged computational layer
 

3235
00:54:56,099 --> 00:54:57,530
is a a privileged computational layer
that gives you access to the actual

3236
00:54:57,530 --> 00:54:57,540
that gives you access to the actual
 

3237
00:54:57,540 --> 00:54:59,150
that gives you access to the actual
cognition of the tissue of basal

3238
00:54:59,150 --> 00:54:59,160
cognition of the tissue of basal
 

3239
00:54:59,160 --> 00:55:00,950
cognition of the tissue of basal
cognition so so merging that that

3240
00:55:00,950 --> 00:55:00,960
cognition so so merging that that
 

3241
00:55:00,960 --> 00:55:02,870
cognition so so merging that that
developmental biophysics with ideas and

3242
00:55:02,870 --> 00:55:02,880
developmental biophysics with ideas and
 

3243
00:55:02,880 --> 00:55:04,490
developmental biophysics with ideas and
cognition of computation and so on I

3244
00:55:04,490 --> 00:55:04,500
cognition of computation and so on I
 

3245
00:55:04,500 --> 00:55:05,390
cognition of computation and so on I
think I think that's what we've done

3246
00:55:05,390 --> 00:55:05,400
think I think that's what we've done
 

3247
00:55:05,400 --> 00:55:07,309
think I think that's what we've done
that's new but people have been talking

3248
00:55:07,309 --> 00:55:07,319
that's new but people have been talking
 

3249
00:55:07,319 --> 00:55:08,750
that's new but people have been talking
about bioelectricity for a really long

3250
00:55:08,750 --> 00:55:08,760
about bioelectricity for a really long
 

3251
00:55:08,760 --> 00:55:11,870
about bioelectricity for a really long
time and and so also I'll Define that so

3252
00:55:11,870 --> 00:55:11,880
time and and so also I'll Define that so
 

3253
00:55:11,880 --> 00:55:13,910
time and and so also I'll Define that so
um what happens is that uh if you have

3254
00:55:13,910 --> 00:55:13,920
um what happens is that uh if you have
 

3255
00:55:13,920 --> 00:55:15,770
um what happens is that uh if you have
uh if you have a single cell cell has a

3256
00:55:15,770 --> 00:55:15,780
uh if you have a single cell cell has a
 

3257
00:55:15,780 --> 00:55:18,349
uh if you have a single cell cell has a
membrane in that membrane are proteins

3258
00:55:18,349 --> 00:55:18,359
membrane in that membrane are proteins
 

3259
00:55:18,359 --> 00:55:20,390
membrane in that membrane are proteins
called ion channels and those proteins

3260
00:55:20,390 --> 00:55:20,400
called ion channels and those proteins
 

3261
00:55:20,400 --> 00:55:22,609
called ion channels and those proteins
allow charged molecules potassium sodium

3262
00:55:22,609 --> 00:55:22,619
allow charged molecules potassium sodium
 

3263
00:55:22,619 --> 00:55:25,190
allow charged molecules potassium sodium
chloride to go in and out under certain

3264
00:55:25,190 --> 00:55:25,200
chloride to go in and out under certain
 

3265
00:55:25,200 --> 00:55:27,650
chloride to go in and out under certain
circumstances and when there's an

3266
00:55:27,650 --> 00:55:27,660
circumstances and when there's an
 

3267
00:55:27,660 --> 00:55:30,950
circumstances and when there's an
imbalance of of those ions there becomes

3268
00:55:30,950 --> 00:55:30,960
imbalance of of those ions there becomes
 

3269
00:55:30,960 --> 00:55:32,870
imbalance of of those ions there becomes
a voltage gradient across that membrane

3270
00:55:32,870 --> 00:55:32,880
a voltage gradient across that membrane
 

3271
00:55:32,880 --> 00:55:35,450
a voltage gradient across that membrane
and so all cells all living cells try to

3272
00:55:35,450 --> 00:55:35,460
and so all cells all living cells try to
 

3273
00:55:35,460 --> 00:55:38,210
and so all cells all living cells try to
hold a particular kind of voltage uh

3274
00:55:38,210 --> 00:55:38,220
hold a particular kind of voltage uh
 

3275

difference across the membrane and they

3276
00:55:39,589 --> 00:55:39,599
difference across the membrane and they
 

3277
00:55:39,599 --> 00:55:42,530
difference across the membrane and they
spend a lot of energy to do so when you

3278
00:55:42,530 --> 00:55:42,540
spend a lot of energy to do so when you
 

3279
00:55:42,540 --> 00:55:45,109
spend a lot of energy to do so when you
now now so so that's that's a single

all sitting next to each other they can
 

3285
00:55:49,380 --> 00:55:51,349
all sitting next to each other they can
communicate their voltage state to each

so isn't it incredible that this evolved

3302
00:56:05,630 --> 00:56:05,640
so isn't it incredible that this evolved
 

3303
00:56:05,640 --> 00:56:08,210
so isn't it incredible that this evolved
it's not it's not wild because that

3304
00:56:08,210 --> 00:56:08,220
it's not it's not wild because that
 

3305
00:56:08,220 --> 00:56:09,589
it's not it's not wild because that
didn't exist

3306
00:56:09,589 --> 00:56:09,599
didn't exist
 

3307
00:56:09,599 --> 00:56:11,390
didn't exist
correct this had to be this had to be

3308
00:56:11,390 --> 00:56:11,400
correct this had to be this had to be
 

3309
00:56:11,400 --> 00:56:13,130
correct this had to be this had to be
evolved and had to be invented that's

3310
00:56:13,130 --> 00:56:13,140
evolved and had to be invented that's
 

3311
00:56:13,140 --> 00:56:15,349
evolved and had to be invented that's
right somebody invented electricity in

3312
00:56:15,349 --> 00:56:15,359
right somebody invented electricity in
 

3313
00:56:15,359 --> 00:56:17,150
right somebody invented electricity in
the in the ocean one of this is a good

3314
00:56:17,150 --> 00:56:17,160
the in the ocean one of this is a good
 

3315
00:56:17,160 --> 00:56:20,809
the in the ocean one of this is a good
event yeah so so I mean it is it is

3316
00:56:20,809 --> 00:56:20,819
event yeah so so I mean it is it is
 

3317
00:56:20,819 --> 00:56:22,609
event yeah so so I mean it is it is
incredible um the guy who discovered Gap

3318
00:56:22,609 --> 00:56:22,619
incredible um the guy who discovered Gap
 

3319
00:56:22,619 --> 00:56:24,349
incredible um the guy who discovered Gap
Junctions Werner Lowenstein I visited

3320
00:56:24,349 --> 00:56:24,359
Junctions Werner Lowenstein I visited
 

3321
00:56:24,359 --> 00:56:27,109
Junctions Werner Lowenstein I visited
him he was really old human being he

3322
00:56:27,109 --> 00:56:27,119
him he was really old human being he
 

3323
00:56:27,119 --> 00:56:29,809
him he was really old human being he
discovered because who really discovered

3324
00:56:29,809 --> 00:56:29,819
discovered because who really discovered
 

3325
00:56:29,819 --> 00:56:32,390
discovered because who really discovered
them live probably four billion years

3326
00:56:32,390 --> 00:56:32,400
them live probably four billion years
 

3327
00:56:32,400 --> 00:56:34,430

ago good point so your your give credit

3328
00:56:34,430 --> 00:56:34,440
ago good point so your your give credit
 

3329
00:56:34,440 --> 00:56:37,309
ago good point so your your give credit
where credit is due he he rediscovered

3330
00:56:37,309 --> 00:56:37,319
where credit is due he he rediscovered
 

3331
00:56:37,319 --> 00:56:39,770
where credit is due he he rediscovered
he rediscovered uh Gap Junctions but um

3332
00:56:39,770 --> 00:56:39,780
he rediscovered uh Gap Junctions but um
 

3333
00:56:39,780 --> 00:56:42,230
he rediscovered uh Gap Junctions but um
when I visited him in in Woods Hole uh

3334
00:56:42,230 --> 00:56:42,240
when I visited him in in Woods Hole uh
 

3335
00:56:42,240 --> 00:56:44,990
when I visited him in in Woods Hole uh
maybe 20 years ago now uh he told me

3336
00:56:44,990 --> 00:56:45,000
maybe 20 years ago now uh he told me
 

3337
00:56:45,000 --> 00:56:46,730
maybe 20 years ago now uh he told me
that he was writing and unfortunately he

3338
00:56:46,730 --> 00:56:46,740
that he was writing and unfortunately he
 

3339
00:56:46,740 --> 00:56:48,530
that he was writing and unfortunately he
he passed away and I think this this

3340
00:56:48,530 --> 00:56:48,540
he passed away and I think this this
 

3341
00:56:48,540 --> 00:56:50,270
he passed away and I think this this
book never got written he was writing a

3342
00:56:50,270 --> 00:56:50,280
book never got written he was writing a
 

3343
00:56:50,280 --> 00:56:51,770
book never got written he was writing a
book on on Gap Junctions and

3344
00:56:51,770 --> 00:56:51,780
book on on Gap Junctions and
 

3345
00:56:51,780 --> 00:56:53,450
book on on Gap Junctions and
Consciousness and I think I think it

3346
00:56:53,450 --> 00:56:53,460
Consciousness and I think I think it
 

3347
00:56:53,460 --> 00:56:55,130
Consciousness and I think I think it
would have been a an Incredible Book

3348
00:56:55,130 --> 00:56:55,140
would have been a an Incredible Book
 

3349
00:56:55,140 --> 00:56:56,690
would have been a an Incredible Book
because because Gap junctures are magic

3350
00:56:56,690 --> 00:56:56,700
because because Gap junctures are magic
 

3351
00:56:56,700 --> 00:56:59,390
because because Gap junctures are magic
I'll explain why in a minute uh what

3352
00:56:59,390 --> 00:56:59,400
I'll explain why in a minute uh what
 

3353
00:56:59,400 --> 00:57:01,790
I'll explain why in a minute uh what
happens is that just imagine the thing

3354
00:57:01,790 --> 00:57:01,800
happens is that just imagine the thing
 

3355
00:57:01,800 --> 00:57:03,650
happens is that just imagine the thing
about both these ion channels and these

3356
00:57:03,650 --> 00:57:03,660
about both these ion channels and these
 

3357
00:57:03,660 --> 00:57:05,870
about both these ion channels and these
Gap Junctions is that many of them are

3358
00:57:05,870 --> 00:57:05,880
Gap Junctions is that many of them are
 

3359
00:57:05,880 --> 00:57:07,970
Gap Junctions is that many of them are
themselves voltage sensitive

3360
00:57:07,970 --> 00:57:07,980
themselves voltage sensitive
 

3361
00:57:07,980 --> 00:57:10,250
themselves voltage sensitive
so that's a voltage sensitive current

3362
00:57:10,250 --> 00:57:10,260
so that's a voltage sensitive current
 

3363
00:57:10,260 --> 00:57:12,170
so that's a voltage sensitive current
conductance that's a transistor and as

00:57:50,990 --> 00:57:51,000
right it's amazing well your whole body
 

3407
00:57:51,000 --> 00:57:52,730
right it's amazing well your whole body
is doing that all the time just much

3408
00:57:52,730 --> 00:57:52,740
is doing that all the time just much
 

3409
00:57:52,740 --> 00:57:55,670
is doing that all the time just much
slower so there are very few things that

3410
00:57:55,670 --> 00:57:55,680
slower so there are very few things that
 

3411
00:57:55,680 --> 00:57:57,410
slower so there are very few things that
neurons do that other cells that all the

neurons do that other cells that all the
 

3413
00:57:57,420 --> 00:57:58,670
neurons do that other cells that all the
cells in your body don't do they all

3414
00:57:58,670 --> 00:57:58,680
cells in your body don't do they all
 

3415
00:57:58,680 --> 00:58:00,710
cells in your body don't do they all
they all do very similar things just on

3416
00:58:00,710 --> 00:58:00,720
they all do very similar things just on
 

3417
00:58:00,720 --> 00:58:02,450
they all do very similar things just on
a much slower time scale and whereas

3431
00:58:13,140 --> 00:58:14,390
have memories like hey how many fingers
are we supposed to have well how many do

3432
00:58:14,390 --> 00:58:14,400
are we supposed to have well how many do
 

3433
00:58:14,400 --> 00:58:15,770
are we supposed to have well how many do
we have now what do we do to get from

3434
00:58:15,770 --> 00:58:15,780
we have now what do we do to get from
 

3435
00:58:15,780 --> 00:58:17,210
we have now what do we do to get from
here to there that's the kind of

3436
00:58:17,210 --> 00:58:17,220
here to there that's the kind of
 

3437
00:58:17,220 --> 00:58:19,069
here to there that's the kind of
problems they're thinking about and the

3438
00:58:19,069 --> 00:58:19,079
problems they're thinking about and the
 

3439
00:58:19,079 --> 00:58:21,049
problems they're thinking about and the
reason that Gap Junctions are magic is

3440
00:58:21,049 --> 00:58:21,059
reason that Gap Junctions are magic is
 

3441
00:58:21,059 --> 00:58:23,750

I'm here are two cells this cell uh how

3446
00:58:29,510 --> 00:58:29,520
I'm here are two cells this cell uh how
 

3447
00:58:29,520 --> 00:58:30,950
I'm here are two cells this cell uh how
can they communicate well well the

3448
00:58:30,950 --> 00:58:30,960
can they communicate well well the
 

3449
00:58:30,960 --> 00:58:33,530
can they communicate well well the
simple version is this cell could send a

3450
00:58:33,530 --> 00:58:33,540
simple version is this cell could send a
 

3451
00:58:33,540 --> 00:58:35,510
simple version is this cell could send a
chemical a chemical signal it floats

3452
00:58:35,510 --> 00:58:35,520
chemical a chemical signal it floats
 

3453
00:58:35,520 --> 00:58:37,010
chemical a chemical signal it floats
over and it hits a receptor on this cell

3454
00:58:37,010 --> 00:58:37,020
over and it hits a receptor on this cell
 

3455
00:58:37,020 --> 00:58:37,849
over and it hits a receptor on this cell
right

3456
00:58:37,849 --> 00:58:37,859
right
 

3457
00:58:37,859 --> 00:58:39,530
right
because it comes from outside this cell

3458
00:58:39,530 --> 00:58:39,540
because it comes from outside this cell
 

3459
00:58:39,540 --> 00:58:41,089
because it comes from outside this cell
can very easily tell that that came from

3460
00:58:41,089 --> 00:58:41,099
can very easily tell that that came from
 

3461
00:58:41,099 --> 00:58:42,890
can very easily tell that that came from
outside it's this is whatever

00:59:54,170 --> 00:59:54,180
there are
 

3537
00:59:54,180 --> 00:59:56,210
there are
um uh chemical networks so for example

3538
00:59:56,210 --> 00:59:56,220
um uh chemical networks so for example
 

3539
00:59:56,220 --> 00:59:58,250
um uh chemical networks so for example
Gene regulatory networks right which

3540
00:59:58,250 --> 00:59:58,260
Gene regulatory networks right which
 

3541
00:59:58,260 --> 00:59:59,930
Gene regulatory networks right which
which are or basically any kind of

chemicals activate and repress each

3546
01:00:02,569 --> 01:00:02,579
chemicals activate and repress each
 

3547
01:00:02,579 --> 01:00:04,789
chemicals activate and repress each
other they can store memories so in the

3548
01:00:04,789 --> 01:00:04,799
other they can store memories so in the
 

3549
01:00:04,799 --> 01:00:06,289
other they can store memories so in the
dynamical system sense they can store

3550
01:00:06,289 --> 01:00:06,299
dynamical system sense they can store
 

3551
01:00:06,299 --> 01:00:07,789
dynamical system sense they can store
memories they can they can get into

3552
01:00:07,789 --> 01:00:07,799
memories they can they can get into
 

3553
01:00:07,799 --> 01:00:09,650
memories they can they can get into
stable states that are hard to pull them

3554
01:00:09,650 --> 01:00:09,660
stable states that are hard to pull them
 

3555
01:00:09,660 --> 01:00:11,390
stable states that are hard to pull them
out of right so that's that becomes once

3556
01:00:11,390 --> 01:00:11,400
out of right so that's that becomes once
 

3557
01:00:11,400 --> 01:00:12,710
out of right so that's that becomes once
they get in that's a memory a permanent

3558
01:00:12,710 --> 01:00:12,720
they get in that's a memory a permanent
 

3559
01:00:12,720 --> 01:00:14,270
they get in that's a memory a permanent
memory of so or a semi-permanent memory

3560
01:00:14,270 --> 01:00:14,280
memory of so or a semi-permanent memory
 

3561
01:00:14,280 --> 01:00:15,950
memory of so or a semi-permanent memory
of something that's happened there are

3562
01:00:15,950 --> 01:00:15,960
of something that's happened there are
 

3563
01:00:15,960 --> 01:00:17,990
of something that's happened there are
cytoskeletal structures right that are

3564
01:00:17,990 --> 01:00:18,000
cytoskeletal structures right that are
 

3565
01:00:18,000 --> 01:00:19,250
cytoskeletal structures right that are
physically they store they store

3566
01:00:19,250 --> 01:00:19,260
physically they store they store
 

3567
01:00:19,260 --> 01:00:21,970
physically they store they store
memories in in physical configuration

3568
01:00:21,970 --> 01:00:21,980
memories in in physical configuration
 

3569
01:00:21,980 --> 01:00:24,950
memories in in physical configuration
there are uh electrical memories like

3570
01:00:24,950 --> 01:00:24,960
there are uh electrical memories like
 

3571
01:00:24,960 --> 01:00:27,589
there are uh electrical memories like
flip-flops where there is no physical

3572
01:00:27,589 --> 01:00:27,599
flip-flops where there is no physical
 

3573
01:00:27,599 --> 01:00:30,049
flip-flops where there is no physical
right so so if you look at it I show my

3574
01:00:30,049 --> 01:00:30,059
right so so if you look at it I show my
 

3575
01:00:30,059 --> 01:00:32,390
right so so if you look at it I show my
students this example as a flip-flop and

3576
01:00:32,390 --> 01:00:32,400
students this example as a flip-flop and
 

3577
01:00:32,400 --> 01:00:34,490
students this example as a flip-flop and
the reason that it stores a zero one is

3578
01:00:34,490 --> 01:00:34,500
the reason that it stores a zero one is
 

3579
01:00:34,500 --> 01:00:37,789
the reason that it stores a zero one is
not because some some uh piece of the

3580
01:00:37,789 --> 01:00:37,799
not because some some uh piece of the
 

3581
01:00:37,799 --> 01:00:40,010
not because some some uh piece of the
hardware moved it's because there's a

3582
01:00:40,010 --> 01:00:40,020
hardware moved it's because there's a
 

3583
01:00:40,020 --> 01:00:41,630
hardware moved it's because there's a
there's a cycling of the current in one

3584
01:00:41,630 --> 01:00:41,640
there's a cycling of the current in one
 

3585
01:00:41,640 --> 01:00:43,430
there's a cycling of the current in one
side of the thing if I come over and I

3586
01:00:43,430 --> 01:00:43,440
side of the thing if I come over and I
 

3587
01:00:43,440 --> 01:00:44,630
side of the thing if I come over and I
hold

3588
01:00:44,630 --> 01:00:44,640
hold
 

3589
01:00:44,640 --> 01:00:46,190
hold
um you know I hold the other side to uh

3590
01:00:46,190 --> 01:00:46,200
um you know I hold the other side to uh
 

3591
01:00:46,200 --> 01:00:47,870
um you know I hold the other side to uh
to a high voltage for for you know a

3592
01:00:47,870 --> 01:00:47,880
to a high voltage for for you know a
 

3593
01:00:47,880 --> 01:00:49,970
to a high voltage for for you know a
brief period of time it flips over and

3594
01:00:49,970 --> 01:00:49,980
brief period of time it flips over and
 

3595
01:00:49,980 --> 01:00:52,309
brief period of time it flips over and
now it's here but the heart none of the

3596
01:00:52,309 --> 01:00:52,319
now it's here but the heart none of the
 

3597
01:00:52,319 --> 01:00:53,930
now it's here but the heart none of the
hardware moved the information is in a

3598
01:00:53,930 --> 01:00:53,940
hardware moved the information is in a
 

3599
01:00:53,940 --> 01:00:55,430
hardware moved the information is in a
stable dynamical sense and if you were

3600
01:00:55,430 --> 01:00:55,440
stable dynamical sense and if you were
 

3601
01:00:55,440 --> 01:00:56,930
stable dynamical sense and if you were
to x-ray the thing you couldn't tell me

3602
01:00:56,930 --> 01:00:56,940
to x-ray the thing you couldn't tell me
 

3603
01:00:56,940 --> 01:00:58,730
to x-ray the thing you couldn't tell me
if it was zero or one because all you

3604
01:00:58,730 --> 01:00:58,740
if it was zero or one because all you
 

3605
01:00:58,740 --> 01:00:59,990
if it was zero or one because all you
would see is where the hardware is you

3606
01:00:59,990 --> 01:01:00,000
would see is where the hardware is you
 

3607
01:01:00,000 --> 01:01:01,549
would see is where the hardware is you
wouldn't see the the energetic state of

3608
01:01:01,549 --> 01:01:01,559
wouldn't see the the energetic state of
 

3609
01:01:01,559 --> 01:01:03,230
wouldn't see the the energetic state of
the system so there are also so there

3610
01:01:03,230 --> 01:01:03,240
the system so there are also so there
 

3611
01:01:03,240 --> 01:01:05,450
the system so there are also so there
are bioelectrical states that are held

3612
01:01:05,450 --> 01:01:05,460
are bioelectrical states that are held
 

3613
01:01:05,460 --> 01:01:08,270
are bioelectrical states that are held
in that exact way like like volatile Ram

3614
01:01:08,270 --> 01:01:08,280
in that exact way like like volatile Ram
 

3615
01:01:08,280 --> 01:01:10,370
in that exact way like like volatile Ram
basically like in the in the electrical

3616
01:01:10,370 --> 01:01:10,380
basically like in the in the electrical
 

3617
01:01:10,380 --> 01:01:12,410
basically like in the in the electrical
status it's very akin to

3618
01:01:12,410 --> 01:01:12,420
status it's very akin to
 

3619
01:01:12,420 --> 01:01:14,630
status it's very akin to
the different ways the memory is stored

3620
01:01:14,630 --> 01:01:14,640
the different ways the memory is stored
 

3621
01:01:14,640 --> 01:01:15,890
the different ways the memory is stored
in a computer

3622
01:01:15,890 --> 01:01:15,900
in a computer
 

3623
01:01:15,900 --> 01:01:19,130
in a computer
so there's Ram there's hard drives you

3624
01:01:19,130 --> 01:01:19,140
so there's Ram there's hard drives you
 

3625
01:01:19,140 --> 01:01:20,690
so there's Ram there's hard drives you
can make that mapping right so I think

3626
01:01:20,690 --> 01:01:20,700
can make that mapping right so I think
 

3627
01:01:20,700 --> 01:01:23,089
can make that mapping right so I think
the interesting thing is that based on

3628
01:01:23,089 --> 01:01:23,099
the interesting thing is that based on
 

3629
01:01:23,099 --> 01:01:25,130
the interesting thing is that based on
the biology we can have a more

3630
01:01:25,130 --> 01:01:25,140
the biology we can have a more
 

3631
01:01:25,140 --> 01:01:27,109
the biology we can have a more
sophisticated you know I think we can

3632
01:01:27,109 --> 01:01:27,119
sophisticated you know I think we can
 

3633
01:01:27,119 --> 01:01:29,270
sophisticated you know I think we can
revise some of our some of our um

3634
01:01:29,270 --> 01:01:29,280
revise some of our some of our um
 

3635
01:01:29,280 --> 01:01:31,609
revise some of our some of our um
Computer Engineering methods because

3636
01:01:31,609 --> 01:01:31,619
Computer Engineering methods because
 

3637
01:01:31,619 --> 01:01:32,750
Computer Engineering methods because
there are some interesting things that

3638
01:01:32,750 --> 01:01:32,760
there are some interesting things that
 

3639
01:01:32,760 --> 01:01:34,789
there are some interesting things that
biology does we haven't done yet but but

3640
01:01:34,789 --> 01:01:34,799
biology does we haven't done yet but but
 

3641
01:01:34,799 --> 01:01:36,589
biology does we haven't done yet but but
you can but that map but that mapping is

3642
01:01:36,589 --> 01:01:36,599
you can but that map but that mapping is
 

3643
01:01:36,599 --> 01:01:38,329
you can but that map but that mapping is
not bad I mean I think it works in many

3644
01:01:38,329 --> 01:01:38,339
not bad I mean I think it works in many
 

3645
01:01:38,339 --> 01:01:40,250
not bad I mean I think it works in many
ways yeah I wonder because I mean the

3646
01:01:40,250 --> 01:01:40,260
ways yeah I wonder because I mean the
 

3647
01:01:40,260 --> 01:01:42,530
ways yeah I wonder because I mean the
way we build computers at the root of

3648
01:01:42,530 --> 01:01:42,540
way we build computers at the root of
 

3649
01:01:42,540 --> 01:01:44,329
way we build computers at the root of
computer science is the idea of proof of

3650
01:01:44,329 --> 01:01:44,339
computer science is the idea of proof of
 

3651
01:01:44,339 --> 01:01:47,210
computer science is the idea of proof of
correctness we program things to be

3652
01:01:47,210 --> 01:01:47,220
correctness we program things to be
 

3653
01:01:47,220 --> 01:01:49,390
correctness we program things to be
perfect

3654
01:01:49,390 --> 01:01:49,400
perfect
 

3655
01:01:49,400 --> 01:01:51,349
perfect
reliable

3656
01:01:51,349 --> 01:01:51,359
reliable
 

3657
01:01:51,359 --> 01:01:53,150
reliable
you know this idea of resilience and

3658
01:01:53,150 --> 01:01:53,160
you know this idea of resilience and
 

3659
01:01:53,160 --> 01:01:55,849
you know this idea of resilience and
robustness to unknown conditions is not

3660
01:01:55,849 --> 01:01:55,859
robustness to unknown conditions is not
 

3661
01:01:55,859 --> 01:01:58,130
robustness to unknown conditions is not
as important so that's what biology is

3662
01:01:58,130 --> 01:01:58,140
as important so that's what biology is
 

3663
01:01:58,140 --> 01:02:00,349
as important so that's what biology is
really good at so I don't know what kind

3664
01:02:00,349 --> 01:02:00,359
really good at so I don't know what kind
 

3665
01:02:00,359 --> 01:02:03,470
really good at so I don't know what kind
of systems I don't know how we go from a

3666
01:02:03,470 --> 01:02:03,480
of systems I don't know how we go from a
 

3667
01:02:03,480 --> 01:02:05,569
of systems I don't know how we go from a
computer to a biological system in the

3668
01:02:05,569 --> 01:02:05,579
computer to a biological system in the
 

3669
01:02:05,579 --> 01:02:08,089
computer to a biological system in the
future yeah I think that you know you

3670
01:02:08,089 --> 01:02:08,099
future yeah I think that you know you
 

3671
01:02:08,099 --> 01:02:10,370
future yeah I think that you know you
know the thing about biology like is is

3672
01:02:10,370 --> 01:02:10,380
know the thing about biology like is is
 

3673
01:02:10,380 --> 01:02:12,410
know the thing about biology like is is
all about making really important

3674
01:02:12,410 --> 01:02:12,420
all about making really important
 

3675
01:02:12,420 --> 01:02:14,510
all about making really important
decisions really quickly on very limited

3676
01:02:14,510 --> 01:02:14,520
decisions really quickly on very limited
 

3677
01:02:14,520 --> 01:02:16,069
decisions really quickly on very limited
information I mean that's what biology

3678
01:02:16,069 --> 01:02:16,079
information I mean that's what biology
 

3679
01:02:16,079 --> 01:02:17,809
information I mean that's what biology
is all about you have to act you have to

3680
01:02:17,809 --> 01:02:17,819
is all about you have to act you have to
 

3681
01:02:17,819 --> 01:02:20,030
is all about you have to act you have to
act now that Stakes are very high and

3682
01:02:20,030 --> 01:02:20,040
act now that Stakes are very high and
 

3683
01:02:20,040 --> 01:02:21,890
act now that Stakes are very high and
you don't know most of what you need to

3684
01:02:21,890 --> 01:02:21,900
you don't know most of what you need to
 

3685
01:02:21,900 --> 01:02:23,270
you don't know most of what you need to
know to be perfect and so there's not

3686
01:02:23,270 --> 01:02:23,280
know to be perfect and so there's not
 

3687
01:02:23,280 --> 01:02:25,370
know to be perfect and so there's not
even an attempt to be to be perfect or

3688
01:02:25,370 --> 01:02:25,380
even an attempt to be to be perfect or
 

3689
01:02:25,380 --> 01:02:28,010
even an attempt to be to be perfect or
to get it right in any sense there are

3690
01:02:28,010 --> 01:02:28,020
to get it right in any sense there are
 

3691
01:02:28,020 --> 01:02:29,990
to get it right in any sense there are
just uh things like active inference

3692
01:02:29,990 --> 01:02:30,000
just uh things like active inference
 

3693
01:02:30,000 --> 01:02:33,109

but basically doing the hyper parameters

3732
01:03:24,910 --> 01:03:24,920
but basically doing the hyper parameters
 

3733

feedback loop within the system so
correct itself yeah and then we watch it

3742
01:03:38,870 --> 01:03:38,880
correct itself yeah and then we watch it
 

3743
01:03:38,880 --> 01:03:40,210
correct itself yeah and then we watch it
over time

3744
01:03:40,210 --> 01:03:40,220
over time
 

3745
01:03:40,220 --> 01:03:42,230
over time
accomplished the goals we wanted to

3746
01:03:42,230 --> 01:03:42,240
accomplished the goals we wanted to
 

3747
01:03:42,240 --> 01:03:44,329
accomplished the goals we wanted to
accomplish is that kind of the the dream

3748
01:03:44,329 --> 01:03:44,339
accomplish is that kind of the the dream
 

3749
01:03:44,339 --> 01:03:46,789
accomplish is that kind of the the dream
of the the dogs that you described in

3750
01:03:46,789 --> 01:03:46,799
of the the dogs that you described in
 

3751
01:03:46,799 --> 01:03:49,549
of the the dogs that you described in
the nature paper yeah yeah I mean that's

3752
01:03:49,549 --> 01:03:49,559
the nature paper yeah yeah I mean that's
 

3753
01:03:49,559 --> 01:03:51,950
the nature paper yeah yeah I mean that's
what you just painted is a very good um

3754
01:03:51,950 --> 01:03:51,960
what you just painted is a very good um
 

3755
01:03:51,960 --> 01:03:55,190
what you just painted is a very good um
description of our efforts at

3756
01:03:55,190 --> 01:03:55,200
description of our efforts at
 

3757
01:03:55,200 --> 01:03:56,809
description of our efforts at
regenerative medicine as a kind of

3758
01:03:56,809 --> 01:03:56,819
regenerative medicine as a kind of
 

3759
01:03:56,819 --> 01:03:59,510
regenerative medicine as a kind of
somatic Psychiatry so the idea is that

3760
01:03:59,510 --> 01:03:59,520
somatic Psychiatry so the idea is that
 

3761
01:03:59,520 --> 01:04:01,430
somatic Psychiatry so the idea is that
you're not you know you're not trying to

3762
01:04:01,430 --> 01:04:01,440
you're not you know you're not trying to
 

3763
01:04:01,440 --> 01:04:03,230
you're not you know you're not trying to
micromanage I mean think about the

3764
01:04:03,230 --> 01:04:03,240
micromanage I mean think about the
 

3765
01:04:03,240 --> 01:04:05,329
micromanage I mean think about the
limitations of of a lot of the medicines

3766
01:04:05,329 --> 01:04:05,339
limitations of of a lot of the medicines
 

3767
01:04:05,339 --> 01:04:08,950
limitations of of a lot of the medicines
today we try to

3768
01:04:08,950 --> 01:04:08,960
today we try to
 

3769
01:04:08,960 --> 01:04:11,510
today we try to
interact down at the level of Pathways

3770
01:04:11,510 --> 01:04:11,520
interact down at the level of Pathways
 

3771
01:04:11,520 --> 01:04:13,490
interact down at the level of Pathways
right so so we're trying to micromanage

3772
01:04:13,490 --> 01:04:13,500
right so so we're trying to micromanage
 

3773
01:04:13,500 --> 01:04:16,250
right so so we're trying to micromanage
it what what's the problem well one

3774
01:04:16,250 --> 01:04:16,260
it what what's the problem well one
 

3775
01:04:16,260 --> 01:04:18,650
it what what's the problem well one
problem is that for almost every

3776
01:04:18,650 --> 01:04:18,660
problem is that for almost every
 

3777
01:04:18,660 --> 01:04:21,470
problem is that for almost every
medicine other than antibiotics once you

3778
01:04:21,470 --> 01:04:21,480
medicine other than antibiotics once you
 

3779
01:04:21,480 --> 01:04:23,510
medicine other than antibiotics once you
stop it the problem comes right back you

3780
01:04:23,510 --> 01:04:23,520
stop it the problem comes right back you
 

3781
01:04:23,520 --> 01:04:24,589
stop it the problem comes right back you
haven't fixed anything you were

3782
01:04:24,589 --> 01:04:24,599
haven't fixed anything you were
 

3783
01:04:24,599 --> 01:04:25,910
haven't fixed anything you were
addressing symptoms you weren't actually

3784
01:04:25,910 --> 01:04:25,920
addressing symptoms you weren't actually
 

3785
01:04:25,920 --> 01:04:27,289
addressing symptoms you weren't actually
curing anything again except for

3786
01:04:27,289 --> 01:04:27,299
curing anything again except for
 

3787
01:04:27,299 --> 01:04:30,109
curing anything again except for
antibiotics uh that's one problem the

3788
01:04:30,109 --> 01:04:30,119
antibiotics uh that's one problem the
 

3789
01:04:30,119 --> 01:04:31,490
antibiotics uh that's one problem the
other problem is you have massive amount

3790
01:04:31,490 --> 01:04:31,500
other problem is you have massive amount
 

3791
01:04:31,500 --> 01:04:33,349
other problem is you have massive amount
of side effects because you were trying

3792
01:04:33,349 --> 01:04:33,359
of side effects because you were trying
 

3793
01:04:33,359 --> 01:04:35,930
of side effects because you were trying
to interact at the lowest level it's

3794
01:04:35,930 --> 01:04:35,940
to interact at the lowest level it's
 

3795
01:04:35,940 --> 01:04:37,789
to interact at the lowest level it's
right it's like I'm gonna you know I'm

3796
01:04:37,789 --> 01:04:37,799
right it's like I'm gonna you know I'm
 

3797
01:04:37,799 --> 01:04:39,289
right it's like I'm gonna you know I'm
gonna I'm gonna try to program this

3798
01:04:39,289 --> 01:04:39,299
gonna I'm gonna try to program this
 

3799
01:04:39,299 --> 01:04:41,750
gonna I'm gonna try to program this
computer by changing the the melting

3800
01:04:41,750 --> 01:04:41,760
computer by changing the the melting
 

3801
01:04:41,760 --> 01:04:44,150
computer by changing the the melting
point of copper like maybe you can do

3802
01:04:44,150 --> 01:04:44,160
point of copper like maybe you can do
 

3803
01:04:44,160 --> 01:04:45,890
point of copper like maybe you can do
things that way but my God it's hard to

3804
01:04:45,890 --> 01:04:45,900
things that way but my God it's hard to
 

3805
01:04:45,900 --> 01:04:47,750
things that way but my God it's hard to
to program it right at the hardware

3806
01:04:47,750 --> 01:04:47,760
to program it right at the hardware
 

3807
01:04:47,760 --> 01:04:51,349
to program it right at the hardware
level so what what I think we're we're

3808
01:04:51,349 --> 01:04:51,359
level so what what I think we're we're
 

3809
01:04:51,359 --> 01:04:53,569
level so what what I think we're we're
starting to understand is that and and

3810
01:04:53,569 --> 01:04:53,579
starting to understand is that and and
 

3811
01:04:53,579 --> 01:04:55,069
starting to understand is that and and
by the way this goes back to what you

3812
01:04:55,069 --> 01:04:55,079
by the way this goes back to what you
 

3813
01:04:55,079 --> 01:04:57,650
by the way this goes back to what you
were saying before about uh that we

3814
01:04:57,650 --> 01:04:57,660
were saying before about uh that we
 

3815
01:04:57,660 --> 01:04:59,210
were saying before about uh that we
could have access to our internal state

3816
01:04:59,210 --> 01:04:59,220
could have access to our internal state
 

3817
01:04:59,220 --> 01:05:00,589
could have access to our internal state
right so people who practice that kind

3818
01:05:00,589 --> 01:05:00,599
right so people who practice that kind
 

3819
01:05:00,599 --> 01:05:01,730
right so people who practice that kind
of stuff right so yoga and then

3820
01:05:01,730 --> 01:05:01,740
of stuff right so yoga and then
 

3821
01:05:01,740 --> 01:05:04,250
of stuff right so yoga and then
biofeedback and those those are all the

3822
01:05:04,250 --> 01:05:04,260
biofeedback and those those are all the
 

3823
01:05:04,260 --> 01:05:05,930
biofeedback and those those are all the
people that uniformly will say things

3824
01:05:05,930 --> 01:05:05,940
people that uniformly will say things
 

3825
01:05:05,940 --> 01:05:07,549
people that uniformly will say things
like well the body has an intelligence

3826
01:05:07,549 --> 01:05:07,559
like well the body has an intelligence
 

3827
01:05:07,559 --> 01:05:09,289
like well the body has an intelligence
in the scenario like those two sets

3828
01:05:09,289 --> 01:05:09,299
in the scenario like those two sets
 

3829
01:05:09,299 --> 01:05:11,210
in the scenario like those two sets
overlap perfectly because because that's

3830
01:05:11,210 --> 01:05:11,220
overlap perfectly because because that's
 

3831
01:05:11,220 --> 01:05:13,250
overlap perfectly because because that's
exactly right because once you once you

3832
01:05:13,250 --> 01:05:13,260
exactly right because once you once you
 

3833
01:05:13,260 --> 01:05:14,630
exactly right because once you once you
start thinking about it that way you

3834
01:05:14,630 --> 01:05:14,640
start thinking about it that way you
 

3835
01:05:14,640 --> 01:05:17,030
start thinking about it that way you
realize that the better locus of control

3836
01:05:17,030 --> 01:05:17,040
realize that the better locus of control
 

3837
01:05:17,040 --> 01:05:18,890
realize that the better locus of control
is not always at the lowest level this

3838
01:05:18,890 --> 01:05:18,900
is not always at the lowest level this
 

3839
01:05:18,900 --> 01:05:20,630
is not always at the lowest level this
is why we don't all program with a

3840
01:05:20,630 --> 01:05:20,640
is why we don't all program with a
 

3841
01:05:20,640 --> 01:05:23,030
is why we don't all program with a
soldering iron right we we we take

3842
01:05:23,030 --> 01:05:23,040
soldering iron right we we we take
 

3843
01:05:23,040 --> 01:05:24,530
soldering iron right we we we take
advantage of of the high level

3844
01:05:24,530 --> 01:05:24,540
advantage of of the high level
 

3845
01:05:24,540 --> 01:05:27,049
advantage of of the high level
intelligences that are there which means

3846
01:05:27,049 --> 01:05:27,059
intelligences that are there which means
 

3847
01:05:27,059 --> 01:05:28,609
intelligences that are there which means
trying to figure out okay which of your

3848
01:05:28,609 --> 01:05:28,619
trying to figure out okay which of your
 

3849
01:05:28,619 --> 01:05:31,309
trying to figure out okay which of your
tissues can learn what can they learn uh

3850
01:05:31,309 --> 01:05:31,319
tissues can learn what can they learn uh
 

3851
01:05:31,319 --> 01:05:33,410
tissues can learn what can they learn uh
what you know why is it that um certain

3852
01:05:33,410 --> 01:05:33,420
what you know why is it that um certain
 

3853
01:05:33,420 --> 01:05:34,970
what you know why is it that um certain
drugs stop working after you take them

3854
01:05:34,970 --> 01:05:34,980
drugs stop working after you take them
 

3855
01:05:34,980 --> 01:05:36,650
drugs stop working after you take them
for a while with this habituation right

3856
01:05:36,650 --> 01:05:36,660
for a while with this habituation right
 

3857
01:05:36,660 --> 01:05:38,569
for a while with this habituation right
and so can we understand habituation

3858
01:05:38,569 --> 01:05:38,579
and so can we understand habituation
 

3859
01:05:38,579 --> 01:05:41,569
and so can we understand habituation
sensitization associative learning and

3860
01:05:41,569 --> 01:05:41,579
sensitization associative learning and
 

3861
01:05:41,579 --> 01:05:42,829
sensitization associative learning and
these kinds of things in chemical

3862
01:05:42,829 --> 01:05:42,839
these kinds of things in chemical
 

3863
01:05:42,839 --> 01:05:44,270
these kinds of things in chemical
Pathways we're going to have a

3864
01:05:44,270 --> 01:05:44,280
Pathways we're going to have a
 

3865
01:05:44,280 --> 01:05:46,789
Pathways we're going to have a
completely different way I think

3866
01:05:46,789 --> 01:05:46,799
completely different way I think
 

3867
01:05:46,799 --> 01:05:47,690
completely different way I think
um we're gonna have a completely

3868
01:05:47,690 --> 01:05:47,700
um we're gonna have a completely
 

3869
01:05:47,700 --> 01:05:49,549
um we're gonna have a completely
different way of of using drugs and of

3870
01:05:49,549 --> 01:05:49,559
different way of of using drugs and of
 

3871
01:05:49,559 --> 01:05:51,289
different way of of using drugs and of
medicine in general when we start

3872
01:05:51,289 --> 01:05:51,299
medicine in general when we start
 

3873
01:05:51,299 --> 01:05:53,930
medicine in general when we start
focusing on the goal state States and on

3874
01:05:53,930 --> 01:05:53,940
focusing on the goal state States and on
 

3875
01:05:53,940 --> 01:05:55,609
focusing on the goal state States and on
the intelligence of our subsystems as

3876
01:05:55,609 --> 01:05:55,619
the intelligence of our subsystems as
 

3877
01:05:55,619 --> 01:05:57,589
the intelligence of our subsystems as
opposed to treating everything as if the

3878
01:05:57,589 --> 01:05:57,599
opposed to treating everything as if the
 

3879
01:05:57,599 --> 01:05:59,329
opposed to treating everything as if the
only path was micromanagement from

3880
01:05:59,329 --> 01:05:59,339
only path was micromanagement from
 

3881
01:05:59,339 --> 01:06:01,309
only path was micromanagement from
chemistry upwards well can you speak to

3882
01:06:01,309 --> 01:06:01,319
chemistry upwards well can you speak to
 

3883
01:06:01,319 --> 01:06:04,490
chemistry upwards well can you speak to
this idea of somatic Psychiatry what are

3884
01:06:04,490 --> 01:06:04,500
this idea of somatic Psychiatry what are
 

3885
01:06:04,500 --> 01:06:07,510
this idea of somatic Psychiatry what are
somatic cells how do they form

3886
01:06:07,510 --> 01:06:07,520
somatic cells how do they form
 

3887
01:06:07,520 --> 01:06:10,670
somatic cells how do they form
networks that use bioelectricity to have

3888
01:06:10,670 --> 01:06:10,680
networks that use bioelectricity to have
 

3889
01:06:10,680 --> 01:06:11,870
networks that use bioelectricity to have
memory and all those kinds of things

3890
01:06:11,870 --> 01:06:11,880
memory and all those kinds of things
 

3891
01:06:11,880 --> 01:06:14,089
memory and all those kinds of things
yeah what are somatic cells like Basics

3892
01:06:14,089 --> 01:06:14,099
yeah what are somatic cells like Basics
 

3893
01:06:14,099 --> 01:06:15,410
yeah what are somatic cells like Basics
here systematic cells just means the

3894
01:06:15,410 --> 01:06:15,420
here systematic cells just means the
 

3895
01:06:15,420 --> 01:06:17,150
here systematic cells just means the
cells of your body so much just means

3896
01:06:17,150 --> 01:06:17,160
cells of your body so much just means
 

3897
01:06:17,160 --> 01:06:18,829
cells of your body so much just means
body right so so somatic cells are just

3898
01:06:18,829 --> 01:06:18,839
body right so so somatic cells are just
 

3899
01:06:18,839 --> 01:06:20,329
body right so so somatic cells are just
this I'm not even specifically making a

3900
01:06:20,329 --> 01:06:20,339
this I'm not even specifically making a
 

3901
01:06:20,339 --> 01:06:21,770
this I'm not even specifically making a
distinction between somatic cells and

3902
01:06:21,770 --> 01:06:21,780
distinction between somatic cells and
 

3903
01:06:21,780 --> 01:06:23,030
distinction between somatic cells and
stem cells or anything like that I mean

3904
01:06:23,030 --> 01:06:23,040
stem cells or anything like that I mean
 

3905
01:06:23,040 --> 01:06:25,010
stem cells or anything like that I mean
basically all the cells in your body not

3906
01:06:25,010 --> 01:06:25,020
basically all the cells in your body not
 

3907
01:06:25,020 --> 01:06:26,569
basically all the cells in your body not
just neurons but all the cells in your

3908
01:06:26,569 --> 01:06:26,579
just neurons but all the cells in your
 

3909
01:06:26,579 --> 01:06:27,230
just neurons but all the cells in your
body

3910
01:06:27,230 --> 01:06:27,240

01:06:29,329 --> 01:06:29,339
they form electrical networks during
 

3913
01:06:29,339 --> 01:06:31,730
they form electrical networks during
embryogenesis during regeneration what

3914
01:06:31,730 --> 01:06:31,740
embryogenesis during regeneration what
 

3915
01:06:31,740 --> 01:06:33,230
embryogenesis during regeneration what
those networks are doing

3916
01:06:33,230 --> 01:06:33,240
those networks are doing

01:06:36,289 --> 01:06:36,299
in part is processing information about
 

3919
01:06:36,299 --> 01:06:38,750
in part is processing information about
what our current shape is and what the

01:06:38,750 --> 01:06:38,760
what our current shape is and what the
 

3921
01:06:38,760 --> 01:06:40,609
what our current shape is and what the
goal shape is now how do I know this

3922
01:06:40,609 --> 01:06:40,619
goal shape is now how do I know this
 

3923
01:06:40,619 --> 01:06:42,710
goal shape is now how do I know this
because I can give you a couple of

3924
01:06:42,710 --> 01:06:42,720
because I can give you a couple of
 

3925
01:06:42,720 --> 01:06:44,930
because I can give you a couple of
examples one one example is when we

3926
01:06:44,930 --> 01:06:44,940
examples one one example is when we
 

3927
01:06:44,940 --> 01:06:46,910
examples one one example is when we
started studying this we said okay

3928
01:06:46,910 --> 01:06:46,920
started studying this we said okay
 

3929
01:06:46,920 --> 01:06:48,589
started studying this we said okay
here's a here's a planarian a planarian

3930
01:06:48,589 --> 01:06:48,599
here's a here's a planarian a planarian
 

3931
01:06:48,599 --> 01:06:50,569
here's a here's a planarian a planarian
is a flatworm it has one head and one

3932
01:06:50,569 --> 01:06:50,579
is a flatworm it has one head and one
 

3933
01:06:50,579 --> 01:06:52,910
is a flatworm it has one head and one
tail normally and the amazing the

3934
01:06:52,910 --> 01:06:52,920
tail normally and the amazing the
 

3935
01:06:52,920 --> 01:06:54,529
tail normally and the amazing the
several amazing things about planaria

3936
01:06:54,529 --> 01:06:54,539
several amazing things about planaria
 

3937
01:06:54,539 --> 01:06:56,690
several amazing things about planaria
but basically they kind of I think I

3938
01:06:56,690 --> 01:06:56,700
but basically they kind of I think I
 

3939
01:06:56,700 --> 01:06:58,970
but basically they kind of I think I
think planaria hold the answer to pretty

3940
01:06:58,970 --> 01:06:58,980
think planaria hold the answer to pretty
 

3941
01:06:58,980 --> 01:07:01,609
think planaria hold the answer to pretty
much every deep question of life for one

3942
01:07:01,609 --> 01:07:01,619
much every deep question of life for one
 

3943
01:07:01,619 --> 01:07:03,470
much every deep question of life for one
thing they're similar to our ancestors

3944
01:07:03,470 --> 01:07:03,480
thing they're similar to our ancestors
 

3945
01:07:03,480 --> 01:07:05,029
thing they're similar to our ancestors
so they have true symmetry they have a

3946
01:07:05,029 --> 01:07:05,039
so they have true symmetry they have a
 

3947
01:07:05,039 --> 01:07:06,349
so they have true symmetry they have a
true brain they're not like earthworms

3948
01:07:06,349 --> 01:07:06,359
true brain they're not like earthworms
 

3949
01:07:06,359 --> 01:07:07,309
true brain they're not like earthworms
they're you know they're much more

3950
01:07:07,309 --> 01:07:07,319
they're you know they're much more
 

3951
01:07:07,319 --> 01:07:08,690
they're you know they're much more
advanced life form they have lots of

3952
01:07:08,690 --> 01:07:08,700
advanced life form they have lots of
 

3953
01:07:08,700 --> 01:07:09,829
advanced life form they have lots of
different internal organs but they're

3954
01:07:09,829 --> 01:07:09,839
different internal organs but they're
 

3955
01:07:09,839 --> 01:07:11,270
different internal organs but they're
these little um they're about you know

3956
01:07:11,270 --> 01:07:11,280
these little um they're about you know
 

3957
01:07:11,280 --> 01:07:12,710
these little um they're about you know
maybe two centimeters in in the

3958
01:07:12,710 --> 01:07:12,720
maybe two centimeters in in the
 

3959
01:07:12,720 --> 01:07:14,450
maybe two centimeters in in the
centimeter to two in size

3960
01:07:14,450 --> 01:07:14,460
centimeter to two in size
 

3961
01:07:14,460 --> 01:07:16,849
centimeter to two in size
I have a head and a tail and the first

3962
01:07:16,849 --> 01:07:16,859
I have a head and a tail and the first
 

3963
01:07:16,859 --> 01:07:19,670
I have a head and a tail and the first
thing is plenary are Immortal so they do

3964
01:07:19,670 --> 01:07:19,680
thing is plenary are Immortal so they do
 

3965
01:07:19,680 --> 01:07:21,049
thing is plenary are Immortal so they do
not age there's no such thing as an old

3966
01:07:21,049 --> 01:07:21,059
not age there's no such thing as an old
 

3967
01:07:21,059 --> 01:07:22,910
not age there's no such thing as an old
planarian so that right there tells you

3968
01:07:22,910 --> 01:07:22,920
planarian so that right there tells you
 

3969
01:07:22,920 --> 01:07:24,470
planarian so that right there tells you
that these theories of thermodynamic

3970
01:07:24,470 --> 01:07:24,480
that these theories of thermodynamic
 

3971
01:07:24,480 --> 01:07:26,750
that these theories of thermodynamic
limitations of on lifespan are wrong

3972
01:07:26,750 --> 01:07:26,760
limitations of on lifespan are wrong
 

3973
01:07:26,760 --> 01:07:28,609
limitations of on lifespan are wrong
it's not it's not that well over time of

3974
01:07:28,609 --> 01:07:28,619
it's not it's not that well over time of
 

3975
01:07:28,619 --> 01:07:30,650
it's not it's not that well over time of
everything degrades no planaria can keep

3976
01:07:30,650 --> 01:07:30,660
everything degrades no planaria can keep
 

3977
01:07:30,660 --> 01:07:33,289
everything degrades no planaria can keep
it going for uh probably you know how

3978
01:07:33,289 --> 01:07:33,299
it going for uh probably you know how
 

3979
01:07:33,299 --> 01:07:34,309
it going for uh probably you know how
long have they've been around 400

3980
01:07:34,309 --> 01:07:34,319
long have they've been around 400
 

3981
01:07:34,319 --> 01:07:35,870
long have they've been around 400
million years right so these are the

3982
01:07:35,870 --> 01:07:35,880
million years right so these are the
 

3983
01:07:35,880 --> 01:07:38,210
million years right so these are the
actual so the plenary in our lab are

3984
01:07:38,210 --> 01:07:38,220
actual so the plenary in our lab are
 

3985
01:07:38,220 --> 01:07:39,890
actual so the plenary in our lab are
actually in physical continuity with

3986
01:07:39,890 --> 01:07:39,900
actually in physical continuity with
 

3987
01:07:39,900 --> 01:07:41,390
actually in physical continuity with
planaria that we're here 400 million

3988
01:07:41,390 --> 01:07:41,400
planaria that we're here 400 million
 

3989
01:07:41,400 --> 01:07:44,089
planaria that we're here 400 million
years ago so there's planaria that have

3990
01:07:44,089 --> 01:07:44,099
years ago so there's planaria that have
 

3991
01:07:44,099 --> 01:07:46,730
years ago so there's planaria that have
lived that long essentially what does it

3992
01:07:46,730 --> 01:07:46,740
lived that long essentially what does it
 

3993
01:07:46,740 --> 01:07:48,529
lived that long essentially what does it
mean physical continuity because because

3994
01:07:48,529 --> 01:07:48,539
mean physical continuity because because
 

3995
01:07:48,539 --> 01:07:50,690
mean physical continuity because because
what they do is they split in half the

3996
01:07:50,690 --> 01:07:50,700
what they do is they split in half the
 

3997
01:07:50,700 --> 01:07:52,430
what they do is they split in half the
way they reproduce is they split in half

3998
01:07:52,430 --> 01:07:52,440
way they reproduce is they split in half
 

3999
01:07:52,440 --> 01:07:54,529
way they reproduce is they split in half
so so the planarian the back the back

4000
01:07:54,529 --> 01:07:54,539
so so the planarian the back the back
 

4001
01:07:54,539 --> 01:07:56,210
so so the planarian the back the back
end grabs the petri dish the front end

4002
01:07:56,210 --> 01:07:56,220
end grabs the petri dish the front end
 

4003
01:07:56,220 --> 01:07:58,010
end grabs the petri dish the front end
takes off and then they rip themselves

4004
01:07:58,010 --> 01:07:58,020
takes off and then they rip themselves
 

4005
01:07:58,020 --> 01:08:00,170
takes off and then they rip themselves
in half but is it isn't in some sense

4006
01:08:00,170 --> 01:08:00,180
in half but is it isn't in some sense
 

4007
01:08:00,180 --> 01:08:01,549
in half but is it isn't in some sense
where

4008
01:08:01,549 --> 01:08:01,559
where
 

4009
01:08:01,559 --> 01:08:05,510
where
like you are a physical continuation Yes

4010
01:08:05,510 --> 01:08:05,520
like you are a physical continuation Yes
 

4011
01:08:05,520 --> 01:08:07,069
like you are a physical continuation Yes
except that except that we go through a

4012
01:08:07,069 --> 01:08:07,079
except that except that we go through a
 

4013
01:08:07,079 --> 01:08:08,870
except that except that we go through a
bottleneck of one cell which is the egg

4014
01:08:08,870 --> 01:08:08,880
bottleneck of one cell which is the egg
 

4015
01:08:08,880 --> 01:08:10,430
bottleneck of one cell which is the egg
they do not I mean they can there's

4016
01:08:10,430 --> 01:08:10,440
they do not I mean they can there's
 

4017
01:08:10,440 --> 01:08:12,589
they do not I mean they can there's
certain planarians so we go through a

4018
01:08:12,589 --> 01:08:12,599
certain planarians so we go through a
 

4019
01:08:12,599 --> 01:08:15,289
certain planarians so we go through a
very uh ruthless compression process and

4020
01:08:15,289 --> 01:08:15,299
very uh ruthless compression process and
 

4021
01:08:15,299 --> 01:08:16,910
very uh ruthless compression process and
they don't yes like an auto encoder you

4022
01:08:16,910 --> 01:08:16,920
they don't yes like an auto encoder you
 

4023
01:08:16,920 --> 01:08:19,309
they don't yes like an auto encoder you
know squash down to one cell and then

4024
01:08:19,309 --> 01:08:19,319
know squash down to one cell and then
 

4025
01:08:19,319 --> 01:08:21,769
know squash down to one cell and then
back out these these guys just tear

4026
01:08:21,769 --> 01:08:21,779
back out these these guys just tear
 

4027
01:08:21,779 --> 01:08:22,910
back out these these guys just tear
themselves in half and then each and

4028
01:08:22,910 --> 01:08:22,920
themselves in half and then each and
 

4029
01:08:22,920 --> 01:08:24,050
themselves in half and then each and
then and so the other amazing thing

4030
01:08:24,050 --> 01:08:24,060
then and so the other amazing thing
 

4031
01:08:24,060 --> 01:08:25,729
then and so the other amazing thing
about them is they regenerate so you can

4032
01:08:25,729 --> 01:08:25,739
about them is they regenerate so you can
 

4033
01:08:25,739 --> 01:08:27,650
about them is they regenerate so you can
cut them into pieces the record is I

4034
01:08:27,650 --> 01:08:27,660
cut them into pieces the record is I
 

4035
01:08:27,660 --> 01:08:29,570
cut them into pieces the record is I
think 276 or something like that by

4036
01:08:29,570 --> 01:08:29,580
think 276 or something like that by
 

4037
01:08:29,580 --> 01:08:32,090
think 276 or something like that by
Thomas Hunt Morgan uh and each piece

4038
01:08:32,090 --> 01:08:32,100
Thomas Hunt Morgan uh and each piece
 

4039
01:08:32,100 --> 01:08:34,370
Thomas Hunt Morgan uh and each piece
regrows a perfect little worm they know

4040
01:08:34,370 --> 01:08:34,380
regrows a perfect little worm they know
 

4041
01:08:34,380 --> 01:08:36,349
regrows a perfect little worm they know
exactly every piece knows exactly what's

4042
01:08:36,349 --> 01:08:36,359
exactly every piece knows exactly what's
 

4043
01:08:36,359 --> 01:08:38,510
exactly every piece knows exactly what's
missing what needs to happen uh in fact

4044
01:08:38,510 --> 01:08:38,520
missing what needs to happen uh in fact
 

4045
01:08:38,520 --> 01:08:40,550
missing what needs to happen uh in fact
in fact if you chop it in half as it

4046
01:08:40,550 --> 01:08:40,560
in fact if you chop it in half as it
 

4047
01:08:40,560 --> 01:08:43,849
in fact if you chop it in half as it
grows the other half uh the original the

4048
01:08:43,849 --> 01:08:43,859
grows the other half uh the original the
 

4049
01:08:43,859 --> 01:08:46,249
grows the other half uh the original the
original tissue shrinks so that when the

4050
01:08:46,249 --> 01:08:46,259
original tissue shrinks so that when the
 

4051
01:08:46,259 --> 01:08:47,390
original tissue shrinks so that when the
new tiny head shows up they're

4052
01:08:47,390 --> 01:08:47,400
new tiny head shows up they're
 

4053
01:08:47,400 --> 01:08:49,130
new tiny head shows up they're
proportional so it keeps it keeps

4054
01:08:49,130 --> 01:08:49,140
proportional so it keeps it keeps
 

4055
01:08:49,140 --> 01:08:51,289
proportional so it keeps it keeps
perfect proportion if you if you starve

4056
01:08:51,289 --> 01:08:51,299
perfect proportion if you if you starve
 

4057
01:08:51,299 --> 01:08:52,669
perfect proportion if you if you starve
them they shrink if you feed them again

4058
01:08:52,669 --> 01:08:52,679
them they shrink if you feed them again
 

4059
01:08:52,679 --> 01:08:54,650
them they shrink if you feed them again
they expand their control their

4060
01:08:54,650 --> 01:08:54,660
they expand their control their
 

4061
01:08:54,660 --> 01:08:56,809
they expand their control their
anatomical control is is just insane

4062
01:08:56,809 --> 01:08:56,819
anatomical control is is just insane
 

4063
01:08:56,819 --> 01:08:59,030
anatomical control is is just insane
somebody cut them into over 200 pieces

4064
01:08:59,030 --> 01:08:59,040
somebody cut them into over 200 pieces
 

4065
01:08:59,040 --> 01:09:01,490
somebody cut them into over 200 pieces
yeah yeah Thomas Hunt Morgan did hashtag

4066
01:09:01,490 --> 01:09:01,500
yeah yeah Thomas Hunt Morgan did hashtag
 

4067
01:09:01,500 --> 01:09:03,530
yeah yeah Thomas Hunt Morgan did hashtag
science yeah amazing yeah and maybe more

4068
01:09:03,530 --> 01:09:03,540
science yeah amazing yeah and maybe more
 

4069
01:09:03,540 --> 01:09:04,849
science yeah amazing yeah and maybe more
I mean they didn't have antibiotics back

4070
01:09:04,849 --> 01:09:04,859
I mean they didn't have antibiotics back
 

4071
01:09:04,859 --> 01:09:06,229
I mean they didn't have antibiotics back
then I bet he lost some due to infection

4072
01:09:06,229 --> 01:09:06,239
then I bet he lost some due to infection
 

4073
01:09:06,239 --> 01:09:07,729
then I bet he lost some due to infection
I bet I bet it's actually more than that

4074
01:09:07,729 --> 01:09:07,739
I bet I bet it's actually more than that
 

4075
01:09:07,739 --> 01:09:08,930
I bet I bet it's actually more than that
you could I bet you could do more than

4076
01:09:08,930 --> 01:09:08,940
you could I bet you could do more than
 

4077
01:09:08,940 --> 01:09:10,849
you could I bet you could do more than
that humans can do that

4078
01:09:10,849 --> 01:09:10,859
that humans can do that
 

4079
01:09:10,859 --> 01:09:14,809
that humans can do that
because well yeah yes I mean again true

4080
01:09:14,809 --> 01:09:14,819
because well yeah yes I mean again true
 

4081
01:09:14,819 --> 01:09:16,910
because well yeah yes I mean again true
I accept that you can't at the embryonic

4082
01:09:16,910 --> 01:09:16,920
I accept that you can't at the embryonic
 

4083
01:09:16,920 --> 01:09:18,289
I accept that you can't at the embryonic
level well that's that's the thing right

4084
01:09:18,289 --> 01:09:18,299
level well that's that's the thing right
 

4085
01:09:18,299 --> 01:09:20,030
level well that's that's the thing right
so so I tell when I talk about this I

4086
01:09:20,030 --> 01:09:20,040
so so I tell when I talk about this I
 

4087
01:09:20,040 --> 01:09:22,249
so so I tell when I talk about this I
said just remember that is as amazing as

4088
01:09:22,249 --> 01:09:22,259
said just remember that is as amazing as
 

4089
01:09:22,259 --> 01:09:24,110
said just remember that is as amazing as
it is to grow a whole planarian from a

4090
01:09:24,110 --> 01:09:24,120
it is to grow a whole planarian from a
 

4091
01:09:24,120 --> 01:09:25,729
it is to grow a whole planarian from a
tiny fragment half of the human

4092
01:09:25,729 --> 01:09:25,739
tiny fragment half of the human
 

4093
01:09:25,739 --> 01:09:27,590
tiny fragment half of the human
population can grow a full body from one

4094
01:09:27,590 --> 01:09:27,600
population can grow a full body from one
 

4095
01:09:27,600 --> 01:09:30,650
population can grow a full body from one
cell right so so development is really

4096
01:09:30,650 --> 01:09:30,660
cell right so so development is really
 

4097
01:09:30,660 --> 01:09:32,870
cell right so so development is really
you can look at development as a as a

4098
01:09:32,870 --> 01:09:32,880
you can look at development as a as a
 

4099
01:09:32,880 --> 01:09:35,630
you can look at development as a as a
just an example of regeneration yeah to

4100
01:09:35,630 --> 01:09:35,640
just an example of regeneration yeah to
 

4101
01:09:35,640 --> 01:09:37,309
just an example of regeneration yeah to
think we'll talk about regenerative

4102
01:09:37,309 --> 01:09:37,319
think we'll talk about regenerative
 

4103
01:09:37,319 --> 01:09:39,709
think we'll talk about regenerative
medicine but there's some sense what

4104
01:09:39,709 --> 01:09:39,719
medicine but there's some sense what
 

4105
01:09:39,719 --> 01:09:41,870
medicine but there's some sense what
would be like that warm in like 500

4106
01:09:41,870 --> 01:09:41,880
would be like that warm in like 500
 

4107
01:09:41,880 --> 01:09:44,630
would be like that warm in like 500
years ago

4108
01:09:44,630 --> 01:09:44,640
years ago
 

4109
01:09:44,640 --> 01:09:48,470

regrow hand yep I with we're given time

4110
01:09:48,470 --> 01:09:48,480
regrow hand yep I with we're given time
 

4111
01:09:48,480 --> 01:09:50,329
regrow hand yep I with we're given time
it takes time to grow large things but

4112
01:09:50,329 --> 01:09:50,339
it takes time to grow large things but
 

4113
01:09:50,339 --> 01:09:52,490
it takes time to grow large things but
for now yeah I think so I think you can

4114
01:09:52,490 --> 01:09:52,500
for now yeah I think so I think you can
 

4115
01:09:52,500 --> 01:09:55,550
for now yeah I think so I think you can
probably why not accelerate oh biology

4116
01:09:55,550 --> 01:09:55,560
probably why not accelerate oh biology
 

4117
01:09:55,560 --> 01:09:57,650
probably why not accelerate oh biology
takes his time I'm not going to say

4118
01:09:57,650 --> 01:09:57,660
takes his time I'm not going to say
 

4119
01:09:57,660 --> 01:09:58,970
takes his time I'm not going to say
anything is impossible but I don't know

4120
01:09:58,970 --> 01:09:58,980
anything is impossible but I don't know
 

4121
01:09:58,980 --> 01:10:00,830
anything is impossible but I don't know
of a way to accelerate these processes I

4122
01:10:00,830 --> 01:10:00,840
of a way to accelerate these processes I
 

4123
01:10:00,840 --> 01:10:02,270
of a way to accelerate these processes I
think it's possible I think we are going

4124
01:10:02,270 --> 01:10:02,280
think it's possible I think we are going
 

4125
01:10:02,280 --> 01:10:04,250
think it's possible I think we are going
to be regenerative but I don't know of a

4126
01:10:04,250 --> 01:10:04,260
to be regenerative but I don't know of a
 

4127
01:10:04,260 --> 01:10:05,810
to be regenerative but I don't know of a
way to make it fast if you just think

4128
01:10:05,810 --> 01:10:05,820
way to make it fast if you just think
 

4129
01:10:05,820 --> 01:10:08,450
way to make it fast if you just think
people from a few centuries from now be

4130
01:10:08,450 --> 01:10:08,460
people from a few centuries from now be
 

4131
01:10:08,460 --> 01:10:10,310
people from a few centuries from now be
like well they have to they used to have

4132
01:10:10,310 --> 01:10:10,320
like well they have to they used to have
 

4133
01:10:10,320 --> 01:10:13,790
like well they have to they used to have
to wait a week for the hand to regrow

4134
01:10:13,790 --> 01:10:13,800
to wait a week for the hand to regrow
 

4135
01:10:13,800 --> 01:10:15,830
to wait a week for the hand to regrow
it's like when the microwave was

4136
01:10:15,830 --> 01:10:15,840
it's like when the microwave was
 

4137
01:10:15,840 --> 01:10:19,490
it's like when the microwave was
invented you can you can toast your

4138
01:10:19,490 --> 01:10:19,500
invented you can you can toast your
 

4139
01:10:19,500 --> 01:10:20,930
invented you can you can toast your
um what's that called when you put a

4140
01:10:20,930 --> 01:10:20,940
um what's that called when you put a
 

4141
01:10:20,940 --> 01:10:22,610
um what's that called when you put a
cheese on a toast

4142
01:10:22,610 --> 01:10:22,620
cheese on a toast
 

4143
01:10:22,620 --> 01:10:23,270
cheese on a toast
um

4144
01:10:23,270 --> 01:10:23,280
um
 

4145
01:10:23,280 --> 01:10:28,330
um
foreign

4146
01:10:28,330 --> 01:10:28,340

 

4147
01:10:28,340 --> 01:10:31,790

all right so uh planaria why were we

4148
01:10:31,790 --> 01:10:31,800
all right so uh planaria why were we
 

4149
01:10:31,800 --> 01:10:33,410
all right so uh planaria why were we
talking about the magical planaria that

4150
01:10:33,410 --> 01:10:33,420
talking about the magical planaria that
 

4151
01:10:33,420 --> 01:10:34,910
talking about the magical planaria that
they have the Mystery of Life yeah so

4152
01:10:34,910 --> 01:10:34,920
they have the Mystery of Life yeah so
 

4153
01:10:34,920 --> 01:10:36,169
they have the Mystery of Life yeah so
the reason we're talking about plenary

4154
01:10:36,169 --> 01:10:36,179
the reason we're talking about plenary
 

4155
01:10:36,179 --> 01:10:38,030
the reason we're talking about plenary
is not only are they Immortal okay not

4156
01:10:38,030 --> 01:10:38,040
is not only are they Immortal okay not
 

4157
01:10:38,040 --> 01:10:39,530
is not only are they Immortal okay not
only do they regenerate every part of

4158
01:10:39,530 --> 01:10:39,540
only do they regenerate every part of
 

4159
01:10:39,540 --> 01:10:42,590
only do they regenerate every part of
the body uh they do they generally don't

4160
01:10:42,590 --> 01:10:42,600
the body uh they do they generally don't
 

4161
01:10:42,600 --> 01:10:44,810
the body uh they do they generally don't
get cancer right so which we can talk

4162
01:10:44,810 --> 01:10:44,820
get cancer right so which we can talk
 

4163
01:10:44,820 --> 01:10:46,550
get cancer right so which we can talk
about why that's important they're smart

4164
01:10:46,550 --> 01:10:46,560
about why that's important they're smart
 

4165
01:10:46,560 --> 01:10:47,689
about why that's important they're smart
they can learn things so you can train

4166
01:10:47,689 --> 01:10:47,699
they can learn things so you can train
 

4167
01:10:47,699 --> 01:10:49,790
they can learn things so you can train
them and it turns out that if you train

4168
01:10:49,790 --> 01:10:49,800
them and it turns out that if you train
 

4169
01:10:49,800 --> 01:10:51,770
them and it turns out that if you train
a planarian and then cut their heads off

4170
01:10:51,770 --> 01:10:51,780
a planarian and then cut their heads off
 

4171
01:10:51,780 --> 01:10:53,750
a planarian and then cut their heads off
the tail will regenerate a brand new

4172
01:10:53,750 --> 01:10:53,760
the tail will regenerate a brand new
 

4173
01:10:53,760 --> 01:10:55,250
the tail will regenerate a brand new
brain that still remembers the original

4174
01:10:55,250 --> 01:10:55,260
brain that still remembers the original
 

4175
01:10:55,260 --> 01:10:57,770
brain that still remembers the original
information do they have a biological

4176
01:10:57,770 --> 01:10:57,780
information do they have a biological
 

4177
01:10:57,780 --> 01:11:00,110
information do they have a biological
Network going on or no yes so their

4178
01:11:00,110 --> 01:11:00,120
Network going on or no yes so their
 

4179
01:11:00,120 --> 01:11:02,990
Network going on or no yes so their
somatic cells are forming a network and

4180
01:11:02,990 --> 01:11:03,000
somatic cells are forming a network and
 

4181
01:11:03,000 --> 01:11:04,490
somatic cells are forming a network and
that's that's what you mean by true

4182
01:11:04,490 --> 01:11:04,500
that's that's what you mean by true
 

4183
01:11:04,500 --> 01:11:06,470
that's that's what you mean by true
brain what's the requirement for a true

4184
01:11:06,470 --> 01:11:06,480
brain what's the requirement for a true
 

4185
01:11:06,480 --> 01:11:08,450

Continuum but but a true brain has

4188
01:11:10,790 --> 01:11:10,800
Continuum but but a true brain has
 

4189
01:11:10,800 --> 01:11:12,350
Continuum but but a true brain has
certain characteristics as far as the

01:11:12,350 --> 01:11:12,360
certain characteristics as far as the
 

4191
01:11:12,360 --> 01:11:14,450
certain characteristics as far as the
density like a localized density of

exactly exactly if you cut their head

4196
01:11:18,770 --> 01:11:18,780
exactly exactly if you cut their head
 

4197
01:11:18,780 --> 01:11:20,990
exactly exactly if you cut their head
off uh the the tail doesn't have that

4198
01:11:20,990 --> 01:11:21,000
off uh the the tail doesn't have that
 

4199
01:11:21,000 --> 01:11:22,189
off uh the the tail doesn't have that
doesn't do anything it just sits there

a new brain regenerates they have all

4204
01:11:26,149 --> 01:11:26,159
a new brain regenerates they have all
 

4205
01:11:26,159 --> 01:11:27,530
a new brain regenerates they have all
the same neurotransmitters that you and

4206

the same neurotransmitters that you and
 

4207
01:11:27,540 --> 01:11:29,270
the same neurotransmitters that you and
I have but here's why here's what we're

4208
01:11:29,270 --> 01:11:29,280
I have but here's why here's what we're
 

4209
01:11:29,280 --> 01:11:30,770
I have but here's why here's what we're
talking about them in in this in this

4210
01:11:30,770 --> 01:11:30,780
talking about them in in this in this
 

4211
01:11:30,780 --> 01:11:32,750
talking about them in in this in this
context so here's your plenary you cut

4212
01:11:32,750 --> 01:11:32,760
context so here's your plenary you cut
 

4213
01:11:32,760 --> 01:11:33,830
context so here's your plenary you cut
off the head you cut off the tail you

4214
01:11:33,830 --> 01:11:33,840
off the head you cut off the tail you
 

4215
01:11:33,840 --> 01:11:35,090
off the head you cut off the tail you
have a middle fragment that middle

4216
01:11:35,090 --> 01:11:35,100
have a middle fragment that middle
 

4217
01:11:35,100 --> 01:11:36,590
have a middle fragment that middle
fragment has to make one head and one

4218
01:11:36,590 --> 01:11:36,600
fragment has to make one head and one
 

4219
01:11:36,600 --> 01:11:38,750
fragment has to make one head and one
tail how does it know how many of each

4220
01:11:38,750 --> 01:11:38,760
tail how does it know how many of each
 

4221
01:11:38,760 --> 01:11:40,430
tail how does it know how many of each
to make and where do they go how come it

4222
01:11:40,430 --> 01:11:40,440
to make and where do they go how come it
 

4223
01:11:40,440 --> 01:11:41,689
to make and where do they go how come it
doesn't switch how come

4224
01:11:41,689 --> 01:11:41,699
doesn't switch how come
 

4225
01:11:41,699 --> 01:11:45,590
doesn't switch how come
so so we did a very simple uh thing and

4226
01:11:45,590 --> 01:11:45,600
so so we did a very simple uh thing and
 

4227
01:11:45,600 --> 01:11:47,270
so so we did a very simple uh thing and
we said okay let's let's make the

4228
01:11:47,270 --> 01:11:47,280
we said okay let's let's make the
 

4229
01:11:47,280 --> 01:11:49,370
we said okay let's let's make the
hypothesis that there's a somatic

4230
01:11:49,370 --> 01:11:49,380
hypothesis that there's a somatic
 

4231
01:11:49,380 --> 01:11:51,830
hypothesis that there's a somatic
electrical Network that remembers the

4232
01:11:51,830 --> 01:11:51,840
electrical Network that remembers the
 

4233
01:11:51,840 --> 01:11:53,270
electrical Network that remembers the
correct pattern and then what it's doing

4234
01:11:53,270 --> 01:11:53,280
correct pattern and then what it's doing
 

4235
01:11:53,280 --> 01:11:54,950
correct pattern and then what it's doing
is is recalling that memory and building

4236
01:11:54,950 --> 01:11:54,960
is is recalling that memory and building
 

4237
01:11:54,960 --> 01:11:56,810
is is recalling that memory and building
to that pattern so what we did was we

4238
01:11:56,810 --> 01:11:56,820
to that pattern so what we did was we
 

4239
01:11:56,820 --> 01:11:59,810
to that pattern so what we did was we
used a um a way to visualize electrical

4240
01:11:59,810 --> 01:11:59,820
used a um a way to visualize electrical
 

4241
01:11:59,820 --> 01:12:01,490
used a um a way to visualize electrical
activity in these cells right it's a

4242
01:12:01,490 --> 01:12:01,500
activity in these cells right it's a
 

4243
01:12:01,500 --> 01:12:03,229
activity in these cells right it's a
it's a it's a variant of what people use

4244
01:12:03,229 --> 01:12:03,239
it's a it's a variant of what people use
 

4245
01:12:03,239 --> 01:12:05,209
it's a it's a variant of what people use
to look for electricity in the brain and

4246
01:12:05,209 --> 01:12:05,219
to look for electricity in the brain and
 

4247
01:12:05,219 --> 01:12:06,830
to look for electricity in the brain and
we saw that it has a that that fragment

4248
01:12:06,830 --> 01:12:06,840
we saw that it has a that that fragment
 

4249
01:12:06,840 --> 01:12:09,890
we saw that it has a that that fragment
has a very very particular electrical

4250
01:12:09,890 --> 01:12:09,900
has a very very particular electrical
 

4251
01:12:09,900 --> 01:12:11,510
has a very very particular electrical
pattern you can literally see it once

4252
01:12:11,510 --> 01:12:11,520
pattern you can literally see it once
 

4253
01:12:11,520 --> 01:12:13,550
pattern you can literally see it once
once we developed a technique it has a

4254
01:12:13,550 --> 01:12:13,560
once we developed a technique it has a
 

4255
01:12:13,560 --> 01:12:16,130
once we developed a technique it has a
very particular electrical pattern that

4256
01:12:16,130 --> 01:12:16,140
very particular electrical pattern that
 

4257
01:12:16,140 --> 01:12:17,570
very particular electrical pattern that
shows you where the head and the tail

4258
01:12:17,570 --> 01:12:17,580
shows you where the head and the tail
 

4259
01:12:17,580 --> 01:12:19,250
shows you where the head and the tail
goes right you can you can just see it

4260
01:12:19,250 --> 01:12:19,260
goes right you can you can just see it
 

4261
01:12:19,260 --> 01:12:21,229
goes right you can you can just see it
and then we said okay well now let's

4262
01:12:21,229 --> 01:12:21,239
and then we said okay well now let's
 

4263
01:12:21,239 --> 01:12:23,090
and then we said okay well now let's
test the idea that that's a memory that

4264
01:12:23,090 --> 01:12:23,100
test the idea that that's a memory that
 

4265
01:12:23,100 --> 01:12:24,410
test the idea that that's a memory that
actually controls where the head and the

4266
01:12:24,410 --> 01:12:24,420
actually controls where the head and the
 

4267
01:12:24,420 --> 01:12:26,149
actually controls where the head and the
tail goes let's change that pattern so

4268
01:12:26,149 --> 01:12:26,159
tail goes let's change that pattern so
 

4269
01:12:26,159 --> 01:12:28,250
tail goes let's change that pattern so
basically incept a false memory and so

4270
01:12:28,250 --> 01:12:28,260
basically incept a false memory and so
 

4271
01:12:28,260 --> 01:12:29,510
basically incept a false memory and so
what you can do is you can do that in

4272
01:12:29,510 --> 01:12:29,520
what you can do is you can do that in
 

4273
01:12:29,520 --> 01:12:30,890
what you can do is you can do that in
many different ways one way is with

4274
01:12:30,890 --> 01:12:30,900
many different ways one way is with
 

4275
01:12:30,900 --> 01:12:33,590
many different ways one way is with
drugs the target ion channels to say and

4276
01:12:33,590 --> 01:12:33,600
drugs the target ion channels to say and
 

4277
01:12:33,600 --> 01:12:35,330
drugs the target ion channels to say and
so you pick these drugs and you say okay

4278
01:12:35,330 --> 01:12:35,340
so you pick these drugs and you say okay
 

4279
01:12:35,340 --> 01:12:37,610
so you pick these drugs and you say okay
I'm going to do it so that instead of so

4280
01:12:37,610 --> 01:12:37,620
I'm going to do it so that instead of so
 

4281
01:12:37,620 --> 01:12:39,050
I'm going to do it so that instead of so
that instead of this one head one tail

4282
01:12:39,050 --> 01:12:39,060
that instead of this one head one tail
 

4283
01:12:39,060 --> 01:12:41,209
that instead of this one head one tail
electrical pattern you have a two-headed

4284
01:12:41,209 --> 01:12:41,219
electrical pattern you have a two-headed
 

4285
01:12:41,219 --> 01:12:42,770
electrical pattern you have a two-headed
pattern right you're just editing the

4286
01:12:42,770 --> 01:12:42,780
pattern right you're just editing the
 

4287
01:12:42,780 --> 01:12:44,209
pattern right you're just editing the
electrical information in the in the

4288
01:12:44,209 --> 01:12:44,219
electrical information in the in the
 

4289
01:12:44,219 --> 01:12:45,770
electrical information in the in the
network when you do that guess what the

4290
01:12:45,770 --> 01:12:45,780
network when you do that guess what the
 

4291
01:12:45,780 --> 01:12:47,450
network when you do that guess what the
cells build they build a two-headed worm

4292
01:12:47,450 --> 01:12:47,460
cells build they build a two-headed worm
 

4293
01:12:47,460 --> 01:12:49,550
cells build they build a two-headed worm
and the coolest thing about it now no

4294
01:12:49,550 --> 01:12:49,560
and the coolest thing about it now no
 

4295
01:12:49,560 --> 01:12:50,930
and the coolest thing about it now no
genetic changes so we haven't touched

4296
01:12:50,930 --> 01:12:50,940
genetic changes so we haven't touched
 

4297
01:12:50,940 --> 01:12:52,070
genetic changes so we haven't touched
the genome The genome is totally wild

4298
01:12:52,070 --> 01:12:52,080
the genome The genome is totally wild
 

4299
01:12:52,080 --> 01:12:53,689
the genome The genome is totally wild
type but the amazing thing about it is

4300
01:12:53,689 --> 01:12:53,699
type but the amazing thing about it is
 

4301
01:12:53,699 --> 01:12:54,830
type but the amazing thing about it is
that when you take these two-headed

4302
01:12:54,830 --> 01:12:54,840
that when you take these two-headed
 

4303
01:12:54,840 --> 01:12:56,689
that when you take these two-headed
animals and you cut them into pieces

4304
01:12:56,689 --> 01:12:56,699
animals and you cut them into pieces
 

4305
01:12:56,699 --> 01:12:57,709
animals and you cut them into pieces
again

4306
01:12:57,709 --> 01:12:57,719
again
 

4307
01:12:57,719 --> 01:12:59,750
again
some of those pieces will continue to

4308
01:12:59,750 --> 01:12:59,760
some of those pieces will continue to
 

4309
01:12:59,760 --> 01:13:01,310
some of those pieces will continue to
make two-headed animals

4310
01:13:01,310 --> 01:13:01,320
make two-headed animals
 

4311
01:13:01,320 --> 01:13:04,189
make two-headed animals
so so that information that that memory

4312
01:13:04,189 --> 01:13:04,199
so so that information that that memory
 

4313
01:13:04,199 --> 01:13:05,750
so so that information that that memory
that that electrical circuit not only

4314
01:13:05,750 --> 01:13:05,760
that that electrical circuit not only
 

4315
01:13:05,760 --> 01:13:07,189
that that electrical circuit not only
does it hold the information for how

4316
01:13:07,189 --> 01:13:07,199
does it hold the information for how
 

4317
01:13:07,199 --> 01:13:09,050
does it hold the information for how
many heads not only does it use that

4318
01:13:09,050 --> 01:13:09,060
many heads not only does it use that
 

4319
01:13:09,060 --> 01:13:10,610
many heads not only does it use that
information to tell the cells what to do

4320
01:13:10,610 --> 01:13:10,620
information to tell the cells what to do
 

4321
01:13:10,620 --> 01:13:12,470
information to tell the cells what to do
to regenerate but it stores it once

4322
01:13:12,470 --> 01:13:12,480
to regenerate but it stores it once
 

4323
01:13:12,480 --> 01:13:14,330
to regenerate but it stores it once
you've reset it it keeps and we can go

4324
01:13:14,330 --> 01:13:14,340
you've reset it it keeps and we can go
 

4325
01:13:14,340 --> 01:13:16,010
you've reset it it keeps and we can go
back we can take a two-headed animal and

4326
01:13:16,010 --> 01:13:16,020
back we can take a two-headed animal and
 

4327
01:13:16,020 --> 01:13:18,350
back we can take a two-headed animal and
put it back to one-headed so now imagine

4328
01:13:18,350 --> 01:13:18,360
put it back to one-headed so now imagine
 

4329
01:13:18,360 --> 01:13:19,729
put it back to one-headed so now imagine
so there's a couple of interesting

4330
01:13:19,729 --> 01:13:19,739
so there's a couple of interesting
 

4331
01:13:19,739 --> 01:13:20,930
so there's a couple of interesting
things here that um that have

4332
01:13:20,930 --> 01:13:20,940
things here that um that have
 

4333
01:13:20,940 --> 01:13:22,430
things here that um that have
implications for understanding what web

4334
01:13:22,430 --> 01:13:22,440
implications for understanding what web
 

4335
01:13:22,440 --> 01:13:24,649
implications for understanding what web
genomes and things like that imagine I

4336
01:13:24,649 --> 01:13:24,659
genomes and things like that imagine I
 

4337
01:13:24,659 --> 01:13:26,149
genomes and things like that imagine I
take this two-headed animal

4338
01:13:26,149 --> 01:13:26,159
take this two-headed animal
 

4339
01:13:26,159 --> 01:13:27,830
take this two-headed animal
um oh and by the way when they reproduce

4340
01:13:27,830 --> 01:13:27,840
um oh and by the way when they reproduce
 

4341
01:13:27,840 --> 01:13:29,450
um oh and by the way when they reproduce
when they tear themselves in half you

4342
01:13:29,450 --> 01:13:29,460
when they tear themselves in half you
 

4343
01:13:29,460 --> 01:13:31,189
when they tear themselves in half you
still get two-headed animals so imagine

4344
01:13:31,189 --> 01:13:31,199
still get two-headed animals so imagine
 

4345
01:13:31,199 --> 01:13:32,270
still get two-headed animals so imagine
they take them I throw them in the

4346
01:13:32,270 --> 01:13:32,280
they take them I throw them in the
 

4347
01:13:32,280 --> 01:13:33,830
they take them I throw them in the
Charles River over here so 100 years

4348
01:13:33,830 --> 01:13:33,840
Charles River over here so 100 years
 

4349
01:13:33,840 --> 01:13:35,209
Charles River over here so 100 years
later some scientists come along and

4350
01:13:35,209 --> 01:13:35,219
later some scientists come along and
 

4351
01:13:35,219 --> 01:13:36,709
later some scientists come along and
they scoop up some samples and they go

4352
01:13:36,709 --> 01:13:36,719
they scoop up some samples and they go
 

4353
01:13:36,719 --> 01:13:38,510
they scoop up some samples and they go
oh here's a single headed form in a

4354
01:13:38,510 --> 01:13:38,520
oh here's a single headed form in a
 

4355
01:13:38,520 --> 01:13:40,370
oh here's a single headed form in a
two-headed form wow a speciation event

4356
01:13:40,370 --> 01:13:40,380
two-headed form wow a speciation event
 

4357
01:13:40,380 --> 01:13:42,169
two-headed form wow a speciation event
cool let's sequence The genome and see

4358
01:13:42,169 --> 01:13:42,179
cool let's sequence The genome and see
 

4359
01:13:42,179 --> 01:13:44,030
cool let's sequence The genome and see
why what happened the genomes are

4360
01:13:44,030 --> 01:13:44,040
why what happened the genomes are
 

4361
01:13:44,040 --> 01:13:45,110
why what happened the genomes are
identical there's nothing wrong with the

4362
01:13:45,110 --> 01:13:45,120
identical there's nothing wrong with the
 

4363
01:13:45,120 --> 01:13:46,970
identical there's nothing wrong with the
genome so if you ask the question how

4364
01:13:46,970 --> 01:13:46,980
genome so if you ask the question how
 

4365
01:13:46,980 --> 01:13:48,530
genome so if you ask the question how
does so so this goes back to your very

4366
01:13:48,530 --> 01:13:48,540
does so so this goes back to your very
 

4367
01:13:48,540 --> 01:13:50,030
does so so this goes back to your very
first question is where do body plants

4368
01:13:50,030 --> 01:13:50,040
first question is where do body plants
 

4369
01:13:50,040 --> 01:13:52,189
first question is where do body plants
come from right how does the planarian

4370
01:13:52,189 --> 01:13:52,199
come from right how does the planarian
 

4371
01:13:52,199 --> 01:13:53,270
come from right how does the planarian
know how many heads it's supposed to

4372
01:13:53,270 --> 01:13:53,280
know how many heads it's supposed to
 

4373
01:13:53,280 --> 01:13:55,610
know how many heads it's supposed to
have now it's interesting because you

4374
01:13:55,610 --> 01:13:55,620
have now it's interesting because you
 

4375
01:13:55,620 --> 01:13:58,610
have now it's interesting because you
could say DNA but what hap what what as

4376
01:13:58,610 --> 01:13:58,620
could say DNA but what hap what what as
 

4377
01:13:58,620 --> 01:14:01,250
could say DNA but what hap what what as
it turns out the DNA produces a piece of

4378
01:14:01,250 --> 01:14:01,260
it turns out the DNA produces a piece of
 

4379
01:14:01,260 --> 01:14:03,709
it turns out the DNA produces a piece of
of Hardware that by default

4380
01:14:03,709 --> 01:14:03,719
of Hardware that by default
 

4381
01:14:03,719 --> 01:14:05,930
of Hardware that by default
says one head the way that when you turn

4382
01:14:05,930 --> 01:14:05,940
says one head the way that when you turn
 

4383
01:14:05,940 --> 01:14:07,729
says one head the way that when you turn
on a calculator by default it's a zero

4384
01:14:07,729 --> 01:14:07,739
on a calculator by default it's a zero
 

4385
01:14:07,739 --> 01:14:08,930
on a calculator by default it's a zero
every single time right when you turn it

4386
01:14:08,930 --> 01:14:08,940
every single time right when you turn it
 

4387
01:14:08,940 --> 01:14:10,790
every single time right when you turn it
on just a zero but it's a programmable

4388
01:14:10,790 --> 01:14:10,800
on just a zero but it's a programmable
 

4389
01:14:10,800 --> 01:14:12,649
on just a zero but it's a programmable
calculator as it turns out so once

4390
01:14:12,649 --> 01:14:12,659
calculator as it turns out so once
 

4391
01:14:12,659 --> 01:14:14,870
calculator as it turns out so once
you've changed that next time it won't

4392
01:14:14,870 --> 01:14:14,880
you've changed that next time it won't
 

4393
01:14:14,880 --> 01:14:16,189
you've changed that next time it won't
say zero it'll say something else and

4394
01:14:16,189 --> 01:14:16,199
say zero it'll say something else and
 

4395
01:14:16,199 --> 01:14:17,689
say zero it'll say something else and
the same thing here so you can make you

4396
01:14:17,689 --> 01:14:17,699
the same thing here so you can make you
 

4397
01:14:17,699 --> 01:14:19,010
the same thing here so you can make you
can make one-headed two-headed you can

4398
01:14:19,010 --> 01:14:19,020
can make one-headed two-headed you can
 

4399
01:14:19,020 --> 01:14:20,630
can make one-headed two-headed you can
make no headed worms we've done some

4400
01:14:20,630 --> 01:14:20,640
make no headed worms we've done some
 

4401
01:14:20,640 --> 01:14:21,890
make no headed worms we've done some
other things along these lines some

4402
01:14:21,890 --> 01:14:21,900
other things along these lines some
 

4403
01:14:21,900 --> 01:14:23,990
other things along these lines some
other really weird constructs

4404
01:14:23,990 --> 01:14:24,000
other really weird constructs
 

4405
01:14:24,000 --> 01:14:26,330
other really weird constructs
so so this this is this this question

4406
01:14:26,330 --> 01:14:26,340
so so this this is this this question
 

4407
01:14:26,340 --> 01:14:27,950
so so this this is this this question
all right so again it's really important

4408
01:14:27,950 --> 01:14:27,960
all right so again it's really important
 

4409
01:14:27,960 --> 01:14:29,689
all right so again it's really important
the the hardware software distinction is

4410
01:14:29,689 --> 01:14:29,699
the the hardware software distinction is
 

4411
01:14:29,699 --> 01:14:32,630
the the hardware software distinction is
really important because the hardware is

4412
01:14:32,630 --> 01:14:32,640
really important because the hardware is
 

4413
01:14:32,640 --> 01:14:34,130
really important because the hardware is
essential because without proper

4414
01:14:34,130 --> 01:14:34,140
essential because without proper
 

4415
01:14:34,140 --> 01:14:35,390
essential because without proper
Hardware you're never going to get to

4416
01:14:35,390 --> 01:14:35,400
Hardware you're never going to get to
 

4417
01:14:35,400 --> 01:14:36,950
Hardware you're never going to get to
the right physiology of having that

4418
01:14:36,950 --> 01:14:36,960
the right physiology of having that
 

4419
01:14:36,960 --> 01:14:39,530
the right physiology of having that
memory but once you have it it doesn't

4420
01:14:39,530 --> 01:14:39,540
memory but once you have it it doesn't
 

4421
01:14:39,540 --> 01:14:41,390
memory but once you have it it doesn't
fully determine what the information is

4422
01:14:41,390 --> 01:14:41,400
fully determine what the information is
 

4423
01:14:41,400 --> 01:14:42,410
fully determine what the information is
going to be you can have other

4424
01:14:42,410 --> 01:14:42,420
going to be you can have other
 

4425
01:14:42,420 --> 01:14:43,669
going to be you can have other
information in there and it's

4426
01:14:43,669 --> 01:14:43,679
information in there and it's
 

4427
01:14:43,679 --> 01:14:45,649
information in there and it's
reprogrammable by us by bacteria by

4428
01:14:45,649 --> 01:14:45,659
reprogrammable by us by bacteria by
 

4429
01:14:45,659 --> 01:14:47,510
reprogrammable by us by bacteria by
various parasites probably

4430
01:14:47,510 --> 01:14:47,520
various parasites probably
 

4431
01:14:47,520 --> 01:14:49,370
various parasites probably
um things like that the other amazing

4432
01:14:49,370 --> 01:14:49,380
um things like that the other amazing
 

4433
01:14:49,380 --> 01:14:51,050
um things like that the other amazing
thing about these planarias think about

4434
01:14:51,050 --> 01:14:51,060
thing about these planarias think about
 

4435
01:14:51,060 --> 01:14:53,689
thing about these planarias think about
this most animals when we get a mutation

4436
01:14:53,689 --> 01:14:53,699
this most animals when we get a mutation
 

4437
01:14:53,699 --> 01:14:55,669
this most animals when we get a mutation
in our bodies our children don't inherit

4438
01:14:55,669 --> 01:14:55,679
in our bodies our children don't inherit
 

4439
01:14:55,679 --> 01:14:56,930
in our bodies our children don't inherit
it right so you could go on you could

4440
01:14:56,930 --> 01:14:56,940
it right so you could go on you could
 

4441
01:14:56,940 --> 01:14:58,610
it right so you could go on you could
run around for 50 60 years getting

4442
01:14:58,610 --> 01:14:58,620
run around for 50 60 years getting
 

4443
01:14:58,620 --> 01:14:59,990
run around for 50 60 years getting
mutations your children don't have those

4444
01:14:59,990 --> 01:15:00,000
mutations your children don't have those
 

4445
01:15:00,000 --> 01:15:01,910
mutations your children don't have those
mutations because we go through the egg

4446
01:15:01,910 --> 01:15:01,920
mutations because we go through the egg
 

4447
01:15:01,920 --> 01:15:03,890
mutations because we go through the egg
stage planaria tear themselves in half

4448
01:15:03,890 --> 01:15:03,900
stage planaria tear themselves in half
 

4449
01:15:03,900 --> 01:15:06,110
stage planaria tear themselves in half
and that's how they reproduce so for 400

4450
01:15:06,110 --> 01:15:06,120
and that's how they reproduce so for 400
 

4451
01:15:06,120 --> 01:15:08,270
and that's how they reproduce so for 400
million years they keep every mutation

4452
01:15:08,270 --> 01:15:08,280
million years they keep every mutation
 

4453
01:15:08,280 --> 01:15:09,950
million years they keep every mutation
that they've had that doesn't kill the

4454
01:15:09,950 --> 01:15:09,960
that they've had that doesn't kill the
 

4455
01:15:09,960 --> 01:15:12,229
that they've had that doesn't kill the
cell that it's in so when you look at

4456
01:15:12,229 --> 01:15:12,239
cell that it's in so when you look at
 

4457
01:15:12,239 --> 01:15:13,610
cell that it's in so when you look at
these planaria their bodies are what's

4458
01:15:13,610 --> 01:15:13,620
these planaria their bodies are what's
 

4459
01:15:13,620 --> 01:15:15,350
these planaria their bodies are what's
called mixoploid meaning that every cell

4460
01:15:15,350 --> 01:15:15,360
called mixoploid meaning that every cell
 

4461
01:15:15,360 --> 01:15:16,310
called mixoploid meaning that every cell
might have a different number of

4462
01:15:16,310 --> 01:15:16,320
might have a different number of
 

4463
01:15:16,320 --> 01:15:17,930
might have a different number of
chromosomes they look like a tumor if

4464
01:15:17,930 --> 01:15:17,940
chromosomes they look like a tumor if
 

4465
01:15:17,940 --> 01:15:19,550
chromosomes they look like a tumor if
you look at the the the the the the the

4466
01:15:19,550 --> 01:15:19,560
you look at the the the the the the the
 

4467
01:15:19,560 --> 01:15:21,290
you look at the the the the the the the
the the the genome is an incredible mess

4468
01:15:21,290 --> 01:15:21,300
the the the genome is an incredible mess
 

4469
01:15:21,300 --> 01:15:22,610
the the the genome is an incredible mess
because they accumulate all this stuff

4470
01:15:22,610 --> 01:15:22,620
because they accumulate all this stuff
 

4471
01:15:22,620 --> 01:15:25,910
because they accumulate all this stuff
and yet the the their body structure is

4472
01:15:25,910 --> 01:15:25,920
and yet the the their body structure is
 

4473
01:15:25,920 --> 01:15:27,530
and yet the the their body structure is
they are the best regenerators on the

01:15:27,530 --> 01:15:27,540
they are the best regenerators on the
 

4475
01:15:27,540 --> 01:15:29,270
they are the best regenerators on the
planet their Anatomy is Rock Solid even

01:15:29,270 --> 01:15:29,280
planet their Anatomy is Rock Solid even
 

4477
01:15:29,280 --> 01:15:30,590
planet their Anatomy is Rock Solid even
though their genome is always all kinds

4478
01:15:30,590 --> 01:15:30,600
though their genome is always all kinds
 

4479
01:15:30,600 --> 01:15:32,930
though their genome is always all kinds
of crap so this is uh kind of a scandal

4480
01:15:32,930 --> 01:15:32,940
of crap so this is uh kind of a scandal
 

4481
01:15:32,940 --> 01:15:35,930
of crap so this is uh kind of a scandal
right that you know when we learn that

4482
01:15:35,930 --> 01:15:35,940
right that you know when we learn that
 

4483
01:15:35,940 --> 01:15:37,070
right that you know when we learn that
well you know what are genomes to what

right really we're just beginning to

4494
01:15:45,530 --> 01:15:45,540
right really we're just beginning to
 

4495
01:15:45,540 --> 01:15:47,510
right really we're just beginning to
start to understand this um relationship

4496
01:15:47,510 --> 01:15:47,520
start to understand this um relationship
 

4497
01:15:47,520 --> 01:15:49,370
start to understand this um relationship
between the genomically determined

4498
01:15:49,370 --> 01:15:49,380
between the genomically determined
 

4499
01:15:49,380 --> 01:15:51,830
between the genomically determined
hardware and and by the way just as a as

4500
01:15:51,830 --> 01:15:51,840
hardware and and by the way just as a as
 

4501
01:15:51,840 --> 01:15:53,689

of a couple of months ago I think I now

4502
01:15:53,689 --> 01:15:53,699
of a couple of months ago I think I now
 

4503
01:15:53,699 --> 01:15:56,030
of a couple of months ago I think I now
somewhat understand why this is but it's

4504
01:15:56,030 --> 01:15:56,040
somewhat understand why this is but it's
 

4505
01:15:56,040 --> 01:15:57,530
somewhat understand why this is but it's
really it's really a major you know a

4506
01:15:57,530 --> 01:15:57,540
really it's really a major you know a
 

4507
01:15:57,540 --> 01:15:59,870
really it's really a major you know a
major puzzle I mean that really throws a

4508
01:15:59,870 --> 01:15:59,880
major puzzle I mean that really throws a
 

4509
01:15:59,880 --> 01:16:01,790
major puzzle I mean that really throws a
wrench into the whole

4510
01:16:01,790 --> 01:16:01,800
wrench into the whole
 

4511
01:16:01,800 --> 01:16:04,370

4512
01:16:04,370 --> 01:16:04,380
nature versus nurture
 

4513
01:16:04,380 --> 01:16:07,550
nature versus nurture
because you usually associate

01:16:11,209 --> 01:16:11,219
electricity within with the nurture
 

4517
01:16:11,219 --> 01:16:13,910
electricity within with the nurture
and the hardware with the nature as

4518
01:16:13,910 --> 01:16:13,920
and the hardware with the nature as
 

4519
01:16:13,920 --> 01:16:17,149
and the hardware with the nature as
there's just this weird integrated mess

4520
01:16:17,149 --> 01:16:17,159
there's just this weird integrated mess
 

4521
01:16:17,159 --> 01:16:19,729
there's just this weird integrated mess
yeah that propagates to Generations yeah

4522
01:16:19,729 --> 01:16:19,739
yeah that propagates to Generations yeah
 

4523
01:16:19,739 --> 01:16:21,470
yeah that propagates to Generations yeah
it's much more fluid it's much more

4524
01:16:21,470 --> 01:16:21,480
it's much more fluid it's much more
 

4525
01:16:21,480 --> 01:16:23,030
it's much more fluid it's much more
complex

4526
01:16:23,030 --> 01:16:23,040
complex
 

4527
01:16:23,040 --> 01:16:25,490
complex
um you can you can imagine what's what's

4528
01:16:25,490 --> 01:16:25,500
um you can you can imagine what's what's
 

4529
01:16:25,500 --> 01:16:27,169
um you can you can imagine what's what's
happening here is just imagine the

4530
01:16:27,169 --> 01:16:27,179
happening here is just imagine the
 

4531
01:16:27,179 --> 01:16:29,450
happening here is just imagine the
evolution of a of an animal like this

4532
01:16:29,450 --> 01:16:29,460
evolution of a of an animal like this
 

4533
01:16:29,460 --> 01:16:30,950
evolution of a of an animal like this
that multi-skillers goes back to this

4534
01:16:30,950 --> 01:16:30,960
that multi-skillers goes back to this
 

4535
01:16:30,960 --> 01:16:33,050
that multi-skillers goes back to this
multi-scale competency right imagine

4536
01:16:33,050 --> 01:16:33,060
multi-scale competency right imagine
 

4537
01:16:33,060 --> 01:16:35,270
multi-scale competency right imagine
that you have two two you have an animal

4538
01:16:35,270 --> 01:16:35,280
that you have two two you have an animal
 

4539
01:16:35,280 --> 01:16:38,390
that you have two two you have an animal
that um that where it's it's tissues

4540
01:16:38,390 --> 01:16:38,400
that um that where it's it's tissues
 

4541
01:16:38,400 --> 01:16:39,649
that um that where it's it's tissues
have some degree of multi-scale

4542
01:16:39,649 --> 01:16:39,659
have some degree of multi-scale
 

4543
01:16:39,659 --> 01:16:41,930
have some degree of multi-scale
Competency so for example if the like

4544
01:16:41,930 --> 01:16:41,940
Competency so for example if the like
 

4545
01:16:41,940 --> 01:16:43,310
Competency so for example if the like
like we saw in the tadpole you know if

4546
01:16:43,310 --> 01:16:43,320
like we saw in the tadpole you know if
 

4547
01:16:43,320 --> 01:16:44,689
like we saw in the tadpole you know if
you put an eye on its tail they can

4548
01:16:44,689 --> 01:16:44,699
you put an eye on its tail they can
 

4549
01:16:44,699 --> 01:16:46,310
you put an eye on its tail they can
still see out of that eye right that the

4550
01:16:46,310 --> 01:16:46,320
still see out of that eye right that the
 

4551
01:16:46,320 --> 01:16:47,390
still see out of that eye right that the
you know there's all this incredible

4552
01:16:47,390 --> 01:16:47,400
you know there's all this incredible
 

4553
01:16:47,400 --> 01:16:49,430
you know there's all this incredible
plasticity so if you have an animal and

4554
01:16:49,430 --> 01:16:49,440
plasticity so if you have an animal and
 

4555
01:16:49,440 --> 01:16:51,530
plasticity so if you have an animal and
it comes up for selection and uh the

4556
01:16:51,530 --> 01:16:51,540
it comes up for selection and uh the
 

4557
01:16:51,540 --> 01:16:54,130
it comes up for selection and uh the
fitness is quite good

4558
01:16:54,130 --> 01:16:54,140
fitness is quite good
 

4559
01:16:54,140 --> 01:16:56,149
fitness is quite good
Evolution doesn't know whether the

4560
01:16:56,149 --> 01:16:56,159
Evolution doesn't know whether the
 

4561
01:16:56,159 --> 01:16:57,770
Evolution doesn't know whether the
fitness is good because the genome was

4562
01:16:57,770 --> 01:16:57,780
fitness is good because the genome was
 

4563
01:16:57,780 --> 01:16:59,209
fitness is good because the genome was
awesome or because the genome was kind

4564
01:16:59,209 --> 01:16:59,219
awesome or because the genome was kind
 

4565
01:16:59,219 --> 01:17:01,370
awesome or because the genome was kind
of junky but but the competency made up

4566
01:17:01,370 --> 01:17:01,380
of junky but but the competency made up
 

4567
01:17:01,380 --> 01:17:03,050
of junky but but the competency made up
for it right and things kind of ended up

4568
01:17:03,050 --> 01:17:03,060
for it right and things kind of ended up
 

4569
01:17:03,060 --> 01:17:05,090
for it right and things kind of ended up
good so what that means is that the more

4570
01:17:05,090 --> 01:17:05,100
good so what that means is that the more
 

4571
01:17:05,100 --> 01:17:07,490
good so what that means is that the more
competency you have the harder it is for

4572
01:17:07,490 --> 01:17:07,500
competency you have the harder it is for
 

4573
01:17:07,500 --> 01:17:09,649
competency you have the harder it is for
selection to pick the best genomes it

4574
01:17:09,649 --> 01:17:09,659
selection to pick the best genomes it
 

4575
01:17:09,659 --> 01:17:11,750
selection to pick the best genomes it
hides information right and so that

4576
01:17:11,750 --> 01:17:11,760
hides information right and so that
 

4577
01:17:11,760 --> 01:17:14,149
hides information right and so that
means that uh so so what happens you

4578
01:17:14,149 --> 01:17:14,159
means that uh so so what happens you
 

4579
01:17:14,159 --> 01:17:16,250
means that uh so so what happens you
know Evolution starts basically starts

4580
01:17:16,250 --> 01:17:16,260
know Evolution starts basically starts
 

4581
01:17:16,260 --> 01:17:18,050
know Evolution starts basically starts
although start all the hard work is

4582
01:17:18,050 --> 01:17:18,060
although start all the hard work is
 

4583
01:17:18,060 --> 01:17:19,610
although start all the hard work is
being done to increase the competency

4584
01:17:19,610 --> 01:17:19,620
being done to increase the competency
 

4585
01:17:19,620 --> 01:17:21,410
being done to increase the competency
because it's harder and harder to see

4586
01:17:21,410 --> 01:17:21,420
because it's harder and harder to see
 

4587
01:17:21,420 --> 01:17:23,570
because it's harder and harder to see
the genomes and so I think in planaria

4588
01:17:23,570 --> 01:17:23,580
the genomes and so I think in planaria
 

4589
01:17:23,580 --> 01:17:24,649
the genomes and so I think in planaria
what happened is that there's this

4590
01:17:24,649 --> 01:17:24,659
what happened is that there's this
 

4591
01:17:24,659 --> 01:17:26,870
what happened is that there's this
runaway phenomenon where all the effort

4592
01:17:26,870 --> 01:17:26,880
runaway phenomenon where all the effort
 

4593
01:17:26,880 --> 01:17:29,689
runaway phenomenon where all the effort
went into the algorithm such that we

4594
01:17:29,689 --> 01:17:29,699
went into the algorithm such that we
 

4595
01:17:29,699 --> 01:17:31,189
went into the algorithm such that we
know you got a crappy genome we can't

4596
01:17:31,189 --> 01:17:31,199
know you got a crappy genome we can't
 

4597
01:17:31,199 --> 01:17:32,750
know you got a crappy genome we can't
keep we can't clean up the genome we

4598
01:17:32,750 --> 01:17:32,760
keep we can't clean up the genome we
 

4599
01:17:32,760 --> 01:17:34,490
keep we can't clean up the genome we
can't keep track of it so what what's

4600
01:17:34,490 --> 01:17:34,500
can't keep track of it so what what's
 

4601
01:17:34,500 --> 01:17:36,890
can't keep track of it so what what's
going to happen is what survives are the

4602
01:17:36,890 --> 01:17:36,900
going to happen is what survives are the
 

4603
01:17:36,900 --> 01:17:38,689
going to happen is what survives are the
algorithms that can create a great worm

4604
01:17:38,689 --> 01:17:38,699
algorithms that can create a great worm
 

4605
01:17:38,699 --> 01:17:40,370
algorithms that can create a great worm
no matter what the genome is so

4606
01:17:40,370 --> 01:17:40,380
no matter what the genome is so
 

4607
01:17:40,380 --> 01:17:42,350
no matter what the genome is so
everything went into the algorithm and

4608
01:17:42,350 --> 01:17:42,360
everything went into the algorithm and
 

4609
01:17:42,360 --> 01:17:43,910
everything went into the algorithm and
which which of course then reduces the

4610
01:17:43,910 --> 01:17:43,920
which which of course then reduces the
 

4611
01:17:43,920 --> 01:17:45,470
which which of course then reduces the
pressure on keeping a you know keeping a

4612
01:17:45,470 --> 01:17:45,480
pressure on keeping a you know keeping a
 

4613
01:17:45,480 --> 01:17:48,110
pressure on keeping a you know keeping a
clean genome so this idea of right and

4614
01:17:48,110 --> 01:17:48,120
clean genome so this idea of right and
 

4615
01:17:48,120 --> 01:17:49,790
clean genome so this idea of right and
different animals have this in different

4616
01:17:49,790 --> 01:17:49,800
different animals have this in different
 

4617
01:17:49,800 --> 01:17:51,950
different animals have this in different
to different levels but this idea of

4618
01:17:51,950 --> 01:17:51,960
to different levels but this idea of
 

4619
01:17:51,960 --> 01:17:54,590
to different levels but this idea of
putting energy into an algorithm that

4620
01:17:54,590 --> 01:17:54,600
putting energy into an algorithm that
 

4621
01:17:54,600 --> 01:17:56,990
putting energy into an algorithm that
does not over train on priors right it

4622
01:17:56,990 --> 01:17:57,000
does not over train on priors right it
 

4623
01:17:57,000 --> 01:17:58,850
does not over train on priors right it
can't assume I mean I think biology is

4624
01:17:58,850 --> 01:17:58,860
can't assume I mean I think biology is
 

4625
01:17:58,860 --> 01:18:00,530
can't assume I mean I think biology is
this way in general Evolution doesn't

4626
01:18:00,530 --> 01:18:00,540
this way in general Evolution doesn't
 

4627
01:18:00,540 --> 01:18:02,689
this way in general Evolution doesn't
take the past too seriously because it

4628
01:18:02,689 --> 01:18:02,699
take the past too seriously because it
 

4629
01:18:02,699 --> 01:18:05,030
take the past too seriously because it
makes these basically problem-solving

4630
01:18:05,030 --> 01:18:05,040
makes these basically problem-solving
 

4631
01:18:05,040 --> 01:18:07,250
makes these basically problem-solving
machines as opposed to like exactly what

4632
01:18:07,250 --> 01:18:07,260
machines as opposed to like exactly what
 

4633
01:18:07,260 --> 01:18:09,470
machines as opposed to like exactly what
you know to to deal with exactly what

4634
01:18:09,470 --> 01:18:09,480
you know to to deal with exactly what
 

4635
01:18:09,480 --> 01:18:11,450
you know to to deal with exactly what
happened last time yeah problem solving

4636
01:18:11,450 --> 01:18:11,460
happened last time yeah problem solving
 

4637
01:18:11,460 --> 01:18:14,209
happened last time yeah problem solving
versus memory recall so a little memory

4638
01:18:14,209 --> 01:18:14,219
versus memory recall so a little memory
 

4639
01:18:14,219 --> 01:18:16,610
versus memory recall so a little memory
but a lot of problems so I think so yeah

4640
01:18:16,610 --> 01:18:16,620
but a lot of problems so I think so yeah
 

4641
01:18:16,620 --> 01:18:20,510
but a lot of problems so I think so yeah
in many cases yeah problem solving

4642
01:18:20,510 --> 01:18:20,520
in many cases yeah problem solving

I mean it's incredible that those kinds

4646
01:18:24,169 --> 01:18:24,179
I mean it's incredible that those kinds
 

4647
01:18:24,179 --> 01:18:27,169
I mean it's incredible that those kinds
of systems are able to be constructed

4648
01:18:27,169 --> 01:18:27,179
of systems are able to be constructed
 

4649
01:18:27,179 --> 01:18:28,970

um especially how much they contrast
 

4651
01:18:28,980 --> 01:18:30,830
um especially how much they contrast
with the way we build problem solving

01:18:53,340 --> 01:18:56,090
controversial do you guys get in trouble
for using xenobots or what do people not

4674
01:18:56,090 --> 01:18:56,100
for using xenobots or what do people not
 

4675
01:18:56,100 --> 01:18:58,310
for using xenobots or what do people not
like the words endobots are you trying

4676
01:18:58,310 --> 01:18:58,320
like the words endobots are you trying
 

4677
01:18:58,320 --> 01:19:00,649
like the words endobots are you trying
to be provocative with the word xenobots

4678
01:19:00,649 --> 01:19:00,659
to be provocative with the word xenobots
 

4679
01:19:00,659 --> 01:19:03,110
to be provocative with the word xenobots
versus biological robots I don't know

4680
01:19:03,110 --> 01:19:03,120
versus biological robots I don't know
 

4681
01:19:03,120 --> 01:19:04,970
versus biological robots I don't know
this yeah is there some drama that we

4682
01:19:04,970 --> 01:19:04,980
this yeah is there some drama that we
 

4683
01:19:04,980 --> 01:19:06,530
this yeah is there some drama that we
should be aware of so there's a little

4684
01:19:06,530 --> 01:19:06,540
should be aware of so there's a little
 

4685
01:19:06,540 --> 01:19:08,510
should be aware of so there's a little
bit of drama uh I think I think the

4686
01:19:08,510 --> 01:19:08,520
bit of drama uh I think I think the
 

4687
01:19:08,520 --> 01:19:13,310
bit of drama uh I think I think the
drama is basically related to people

4688
01:19:13,310 --> 01:19:13,320
drama is basically related to people
 

4689
01:19:13,320 --> 01:19:15,530
drama is basically related to people
um having very fixed ideas about what

4690
01:19:15,530 --> 01:19:15,540
um having very fixed ideas about what
 

4691
01:19:15,540 --> 01:19:18,050
um having very fixed ideas about what
terms mean and I think in many cases

4692
01:19:18,050 --> 01:19:18,060
terms mean and I think in many cases
 

4693
01:19:18,060 --> 01:19:21,050
terms mean and I think in many cases
these ideas are completely out of date

4694
01:19:21,050 --> 01:19:21,060
these ideas are completely out of date
 

4695
01:19:21,060 --> 01:19:24,950
these ideas are completely out of date
with with where science is now and for

4696
01:19:24,950 --> 01:19:24,960
with with where science is now and for
 

4697
01:19:24,960 --> 01:19:26,990
with with where science is now and for
sure they're they're out of date with

4698
01:19:26,990 --> 01:19:27,000
sure they're they're out of date with
 

4699
01:19:27,000 --> 01:19:29,110
sure they're they're out of date with
what's going to be I mean these these

4700
01:19:29,110 --> 01:19:29,120
what's going to be I mean these these
 

4701
01:19:29,120 --> 01:19:32,030
what's going to be I mean these these
Concepts uh are not going to survive the

4702
01:19:32,030 --> 01:19:32,040
Concepts uh are not going to survive the
 

4703
01:19:32,040 --> 01:19:33,649
Concepts uh are not going to survive the
next couple of decades so if you ask a

4704
01:19:33,649 --> 01:19:33,659
next couple of decades so if you ask a
 

4705
01:19:33,659 --> 01:19:35,810
next couple of decades so if you ask a
person and including um you know a lot

4706
01:19:35,810 --> 01:19:35,820
person and including um you know a lot
 

4707
01:19:35,820 --> 01:19:37,850
person and including um you know a lot
of people in biology who kind of want to

4708
01:19:37,850 --> 01:19:37,860
of people in biology who kind of want to
 

4709
01:19:37,860 --> 01:19:38,990
of people in biology who kind of want to
keep a sharp distinction between

4710
01:19:38,990 --> 01:19:39,000
keep a sharp distinction between
 

4711
01:19:39,000 --> 01:19:40,850
keep a sharp distinction between
Biologicals and robots right see what's

4712
01:19:40,850 --> 01:19:40,860
Biologicals and robots right see what's
 

4713
01:19:40,860 --> 01:19:43,130
Biologicals and robots right see what's
a robot well a robot it comes out of a

4714
01:19:43,130 --> 01:19:43,140
a robot well a robot it comes out of a
 

4715
01:19:43,140 --> 01:19:45,050
a robot well a robot it comes out of a
factory it's made by humans it is boring

4716
01:19:45,050 --> 01:19:45,060
factory it's made by humans it is boring
 

4717
01:19:45,060 --> 01:19:46,550
factory it's made by humans it is boring
it is a meaning that you can predict

4718
01:19:46,550 --> 01:19:46,560
it is a meaning that you can predict
 

4719
01:19:46,560 --> 01:19:48,410
it is a meaning that you can predict
everything it's going to do it's made of

4720
01:19:48,410 --> 01:19:48,420
everything it's going to do it's made of
 

4721
01:19:48,420 --> 01:19:49,790
everything it's going to do it's made of
metal and certain other inorganic

4722
01:19:49,790 --> 01:19:49,800
metal and certain other inorganic
 

4723
01:19:49,800 --> 01:19:52,189

materials living organisms magical they

4724
01:19:52,189 --> 01:19:52,199
materials living organisms magical they
 

4725
01:19:52,199 --> 01:19:54,050
materials living organisms magical they
they arise right and so on so there's

4726
01:19:54,050 --> 01:19:54,060
they arise right and so on so there's
 

4727
01:19:54,060 --> 01:19:55,729
they arise right and so on so there's
these distinctions I think these these

4728
01:19:55,729 --> 01:19:55,739
these distinctions I think these these
 

4729
01:19:55,739 --> 01:19:57,770
these distinctions I think these these
distinctions I think were were never

4730
01:19:57,770 --> 01:19:57,780
distinctions I think were were never
 

4731
01:19:57,780 --> 01:20:01,010
distinctions I think were were never
good but uh they're going to be

4732
01:20:01,010 --> 01:20:01,020
good but uh they're going to be
 

4733
01:20:01,020 --> 01:20:02,990
good but uh they're going to be
completely useless going forward and so

4734
01:20:02,990 --> 01:20:03,000
completely useless going forward and so
 

4735
01:20:03,000 --> 01:20:04,729
completely useless going forward and so
part of there's a couple of papers that

4736
01:20:04,729 --> 01:20:04,739
part of there's a couple of papers that
 

4737
01:20:04,739 --> 01:20:05,870
part of there's a couple of papers that
that's one paper and there's another one

4738
01:20:05,870 --> 01:20:05,880
that's one paper and there's another one
 

4739
01:20:05,880 --> 01:20:07,490
that's one paper and there's another one
that Josh bongard and I wrote where we

4740
01:20:07,490 --> 01:20:07,500
that Josh bongard and I wrote where we
 

4741
01:20:07,500 --> 01:20:10,010
that Josh bongard and I wrote where we
really attacked the terminology and we

4742
01:20:10,010 --> 01:20:10,020
really attacked the terminology and we
 

4743
01:20:10,020 --> 01:20:12,350
really attacked the terminology and we
say these binary categories are based on

4744
01:20:12,350 --> 01:20:12,360
say these binary categories are based on
 

4745
01:20:12,360 --> 01:20:13,910
say these binary categories are based on
very

4746

4753
01:20:21,420 --> 01:20:23,270
Imagination that were true before but
they've got to go and so and so we call

4754
01:20:23,270 --> 01:20:23,280
they've got to go and so and so we call
 

4755
01:20:23,280 --> 01:20:26,030
they've got to go and so and so we call
them xenobot so so Zeno for xenopus

4756
01:20:26,030 --> 01:20:26,040
them xenobot so so Zeno for xenopus

lavis whether it's the frog that these
 

4759
01:20:28,020 --> 01:20:29,630
lavis whether it's the frog that these
guys are made of but we think it's an

4760
01:20:29,630 --> 01:20:29,640
guys are made of but we think it's an
 

4761
01:20:29,640 --> 01:20:32,330
guys are made of but we think it's an
example of of of of a biobot technology

4762
01:20:32,330 --> 01:20:32,340
example of of of of a biobot technology
 

4763
01:20:32,340 --> 01:20:33,350
example of of of of a biobot technology
because

4764
01:20:33,350 --> 01:20:33,360
because
 

4765
01:20:33,360 --> 01:20:36,169
because
ultimately if we if we under once we

4766
01:20:36,169 --> 01:20:36,179
ultimately if we if we under once we
 

4767
01:20:36,179 --> 01:20:39,350
ultimately if we if we under once we
understand how to uh communicate and

4768
01:20:39,350 --> 01:20:39,360
understand how to uh communicate and
 

4769
01:20:39,360 --> 01:20:40,370
understand how to uh communicate and
manipulate

4770
01:20:40,370 --> 01:20:40,380
manipulate
 

4771
01:20:40,380 --> 01:20:42,470
manipulate
um the inputs to these cells we will be

4772
01:20:42,470 --> 01:20:42,480
um the inputs to these cells we will be
 

4773
01:20:42,480 --> 01:20:45,229
um the inputs to these cells we will be
able to get them to build whatever we

4774
01:20:45,229 --> 01:20:45,239
able to get them to build whatever we
 

4775
01:20:45,239 --> 01:20:46,610
able to get them to build whatever we
want them to build and that's robotics

4776
01:20:46,610 --> 01:20:46,620
want them to build and that's robotics
 

4777
01:20:46,620 --> 01:20:47,750
want them to build and that's robotics
right it's it's the rational

4778
01:20:47,750 --> 01:20:47,760
right it's it's the rational
 

4779
01:20:47,760 --> 01:20:49,550
right it's it's the rational
construction of machines that have

4780
01:20:49,550 --> 01:20:49,560
construction of machines that have
 

4781
01:20:49,560 --> 01:20:51,709
construction of machines that have
useful purposes I I absolutely think

4782
01:20:51,709 --> 01:20:51,719
useful purposes I I absolutely think
 

4783
01:20:51,719 --> 01:20:53,689
useful purposes I I absolutely think
that this is a robotics platform whereas

4784
01:20:53,689 --> 01:20:53,699
that this is a robotics platform whereas
 

4785
01:20:53,699 --> 01:20:56,990
that this is a robotics platform whereas
some biologists don't but it's built in

4786
01:20:56,990 --> 01:20:57,000
some biologists don't but it's built in
 

4787
01:20:57,000 --> 01:20:59,270
some biologists don't but it's built in
a way that

4788
01:20:59,270 --> 01:20:59,280
a way that
 

4789
01:20:59,280 --> 01:21:01,130
a way that
uh all the different components of doing

4790
01:21:01,130 --> 01:21:01,140
uh all the different components of doing
 

4791
01:21:01,140 --> 01:21:03,290
uh all the different components of doing
their own computation so in a way that

4792
01:21:03,290 --> 01:21:03,300
their own computation so in a way that
 

4793
01:21:03,300 --> 01:21:04,430
their own computation so in a way that
we've been talking about so you're

4794
01:21:04,430 --> 01:21:04,440
we've been talking about so you're
 

4795
01:21:04,440 --> 01:21:06,169
we've been talking about so you're
trying to do top down control now that's

4796
01:21:06,169 --> 01:21:06,179
trying to do top down control now that's
 

4797
01:21:06,179 --> 01:21:07,790
trying to do top down control now that's
a biological system and in the future

4798
01:21:07,790 --> 01:21:07,800
a biological system and in the future
 

4799
01:21:07,800 --> 01:21:09,470
a biological system and in the future
all of this will will merge together

4800
01:21:09,470 --> 01:21:09,480
all of this will will merge together
 

4801
01:21:09,480 --> 01:21:10,850
all of this will will merge together
because of course at some point we're

4802
01:21:10,850 --> 01:21:10,860
because of course at some point we're
 

4803
01:21:10,860 --> 01:21:12,169
because of course at some point we're
going to throw in synthetic biology

4804
01:21:12,169 --> 01:21:12,179
going to throw in synthetic biology
 

4805
01:21:12,179 --> 01:21:14,450
going to throw in synthetic biology
circuits right new new um you know new

4806
01:21:14,450 --> 01:21:14,460
circuits right new new um you know new
 

4807
01:21:14,460 --> 01:21:16,070
circuits right new new um you know new
transcriptional circuits to get them to

4808
01:21:16,070 --> 01:21:16,080
transcriptional circuits to get them to
 

4809
01:21:16,080 --> 01:21:17,330
transcriptional circuits to get them to
do new things of course we'll throw some

4810
01:21:17,330 --> 01:21:17,340
do new things of course we'll throw some
 

4811
01:21:17,340 --> 01:21:19,070
do new things of course we'll throw some
of that in but we specifically stayed

4812
01:21:19,070 --> 01:21:19,080
of that in but we specifically stayed
 

4813
01:21:19,080 --> 01:21:21,169
of that in but we specifically stayed
away from all of that because in the

4814
01:21:21,169 --> 01:21:21,179
away from all of that because in the
 

4815
01:21:21,179 --> 01:21:22,430
away from all of that because in the
first few papers and there's some more

4816
01:21:22,430 --> 01:21:22,440
first few papers and there's some more
 

4817
01:21:22,440 --> 01:21:24,050
first few papers and there's some more
coming down the pike that are I think

4818
01:21:24,050 --> 01:21:24,060
coming down the pike that are I think
 

4819
01:21:24,060 --> 01:21:26,270
coming down the pike that are I think
going to be pretty pretty Dynamite

4820
01:21:26,270 --> 01:21:26,280
going to be pretty pretty Dynamite
 

4821
01:21:26,280 --> 01:21:28,729
going to be pretty pretty Dynamite
um that uh we want to show what the

4822
01:21:28,729 --> 01:21:28,739
um that uh we want to show what the
 

4823
01:21:28,739 --> 01:21:30,350
um that uh we want to show what the
native cells are made of because what

4824
01:21:30,350 --> 01:21:30,360
native cells are made of because what
 

4825
01:21:30,360 --> 01:21:31,910
native cells are made of because what
happens is you know if you engineer the

4826
01:21:31,910 --> 01:21:31,920
happens is you know if you engineer the
 

4827
01:21:31,920 --> 01:21:33,350
happens is you know if you engineer the
heck out of them right if we were to put

4828
01:21:33,350 --> 01:21:33,360
heck out of them right if we were to put
 

4829
01:21:33,360 --> 01:21:34,729
heck out of them right if we were to put
in new you know new transcription

4830
01:21:34,729 --> 01:21:34,739
in new you know new transcription
 

4831
01:21:34,739 --> 01:21:36,830
in new you know new transcription
factors and some new metabolic machinery

4832
01:21:36,830 --> 01:21:36,840
factors and some new metabolic machinery
 

4833
01:21:36,840 --> 01:21:38,330
factors and some new metabolic machinery
and whatever people will say well okay

4834
01:21:38,330 --> 01:21:38,340
and whatever people will say well okay
 

4835
01:21:38,340 --> 01:21:40,729
and whatever people will say well okay
you engineered this and you made it do

4836
01:21:40,729 --> 01:21:40,739
you engineered this and you made it do
 

4837
01:21:40,739 --> 01:21:41,990
you engineered this and you made it do
whatever and fine

4838
01:21:41,990 --> 01:21:42,000
whatever and fine
 

4839
01:21:42,000 --> 01:21:44,990
whatever and fine
I wanted to show uh and and the whole

4840
01:21:44,990 --> 01:21:45,000
I wanted to show uh and and the whole
 

4841
01:21:45,000 --> 01:21:48,470
I wanted to show uh and and the whole
team uh wanted to show the plasticity

4842
01:21:48,470 --> 01:21:48,480
team uh wanted to show the plasticity
 

4843
01:21:48,480 --> 01:21:49,970
team uh wanted to show the plasticity
and the intelligence and the biology

4844
01:21:49,970 --> 01:21:49,980
and the intelligence and the biology
 

4845
01:21:49,980 --> 01:21:52,550
and the intelligence and the biology
what does it do that's surprising before

4846
01:21:52,550 --> 01:21:52,560
what does it do that's surprising before
 

4847
01:21:52,560 --> 01:21:54,830
what does it do that's surprising before
you even start manipulating the hardware

4848
01:21:54,830 --> 01:21:54,840
you even start manipulating the hardware
 

4849
01:21:54,840 --> 01:21:58,910
you even start manipulating the hardware
in that way yeah don't try to uh Over

4850
01:21:58,910 --> 01:21:58,920
in that way yeah don't try to uh Over
 

4851
01:21:58,920 --> 01:22:01,250
in that way yeah don't try to uh Over
Control the thing Let It flourish

4852
01:22:01,250 --> 01:22:01,260
Control the thing Let It flourish
 

4853
01:22:01,260 --> 01:22:03,290
Control the thing Let It flourish
the the full beauty of the biological

4854
01:22:03,290 --> 01:22:03,300
the the full beauty of the biological
 

4855
01:22:03,300 --> 01:22:06,709

system why xenopus love is how do you

4856
01:22:06,709 --> 01:22:06,719
system why xenopus love is how do you
 

4857
01:22:06,719 --> 01:22:09,290
system why xenopus love is how do you
pronounce it for slavis yeah yeah it's a

4858
01:22:09,290 --> 01:22:09,300
pronounce it for slavis yeah yeah it's a
 

4859
01:22:09,300 --> 01:22:11,270
pronounce it for slavis yeah yeah it's a
very why this frog it's been used since

4860
01:22:11,270 --> 01:22:11,280
very why this frog it's been used since
 

4861
01:22:11,280 --> 01:22:13,490
very why this frog it's been used since
I think the 50s uh it's just very

4862
01:22:13,490 --> 01:22:13,500
I think the 50s uh it's just very
 

4863
01:22:13,500 --> 01:22:15,830
I think the 50s uh it's just very
convenient because you can you you know

4864
01:22:15,830 --> 01:22:15,840
convenient because you can you you know
 

4865
01:22:15,840 --> 01:22:17,750
convenient because you can you you know
we keep the adults in this in this very

4866
01:22:17,750 --> 01:22:17,760
we keep the adults in this in this very
 

4867
01:22:17,760 --> 01:22:19,729
we keep the adults in this in this very
fine frog habitat they lay eggs they lay

4868
01:22:19,729 --> 01:22:19,739
fine frog habitat they lay eggs they lay
 

4869
01:22:19,739 --> 01:22:22,130
fine frog habitat they lay eggs they lay
tens of thousands of eggs at a time

4870
01:22:22,130 --> 01:22:22,140
tens of thousands of eggs at a time
 

4871
01:22:22,140 --> 01:22:24,590
tens of thousands of eggs at a time
um the eggs develop right in front of

4872
01:22:24,590 --> 01:22:24,600
um the eggs develop right in front of
 

4873
01:22:24,600 --> 01:22:26,030
um the eggs develop right in front of
your eyes it's the most mad magical

4874
01:22:26,030 --> 01:22:26,040
your eyes it's the most mad magical
 

4875
01:22:26,040 --> 01:22:27,830
your eyes it's the most mad magical
thing you can you can see because

4876
01:22:27,830 --> 01:22:27,840
thing you can you can see because
 

4877
01:22:27,840 --> 01:22:29,630
thing you can you can see because
normally you know if you were to deal

4878
01:22:29,630 --> 01:22:29,640
normally you know if you were to deal
 

4879
01:22:29,640 --> 01:22:31,189
normally you know if you were to deal
with mice or rabbits or whatever you

4880
01:22:31,189 --> 01:22:31,199
with mice or rabbits or whatever you
 

4881
01:22:31,199 --> 01:22:32,510
with mice or rabbits or whatever you
don't see the early stages right because

4882
01:22:32,510 --> 01:22:32,520
don't see the early stages right because
 

4883
01:22:32,520 --> 01:22:33,770
don't see the early stages right because
everything's inside the mother here

4884
01:22:33,770 --> 01:22:33,780
everything's inside the mother here
 

4885
01:22:33,780 --> 01:22:34,970
everything's inside the mother here
everything's in a Petri dish at room

4886
01:22:34,970 --> 01:22:34,980
everything's in a Petri dish at room
 

4887
01:22:34,980 --> 01:22:36,649
everything's in a Petri dish at room
temperature so you just you you have an

4888
01:22:36,649 --> 01:22:36,659
temperature so you just you you have an
 

4889
01:22:36,659 --> 01:22:38,090
temperature so you just you you have an
egg it's fertilized and you can just

4890
01:22:38,090 --> 01:22:38,100
egg it's fertilized and you can just
 

4891
01:22:38,100 --> 01:22:39,709
egg it's fertilized and you can just
watch it divide and divide and divide

4892
01:22:39,709 --> 01:22:39,719
watch it divide and divide and divide
 

4893
01:22:39,719 --> 01:22:41,270
watch it divide and divide and divide
and on all the organs form you can just

4894
01:22:41,270 --> 01:22:41,280
and on all the organs form you can just
 

4895
01:22:41,280 --> 01:22:43,070
and on all the organs form you can just
see it and at that point

4896
01:22:43,070 --> 01:22:43,080
see it and at that point
 

4897
01:22:43,080 --> 01:22:45,169
see it and at that point
um the community has has developed lots

4898
01:22:45,169 --> 01:22:45,179
um the community has has developed lots
 

4899
01:22:45,179 --> 01:22:46,750
um the community has has developed lots
of different tools for

4900
01:22:46,750 --> 01:22:46,760
of different tools for
 

4901
01:22:46,760 --> 01:22:48,649
of different tools for
understanding what's going on and also

4902
01:22:48,649 --> 01:22:48,659
understanding what's going on and also
 

4903
01:22:48,659 --> 01:22:50,270
understanding what's going on and also
but for manipulating right so it's

4904
01:22:50,270 --> 01:22:50,280
but for manipulating right so it's
 

4905
01:22:50,280 --> 01:22:52,430
but for manipulating right so it's
people use it for um you know for

4906
01:22:52,430 --> 01:22:52,440
people use it for um you know for
 

4907
01:22:52,440 --> 01:22:53,689
people use it for um you know for
understanding birth defects and

4908
01:22:53,689 --> 01:22:53,699
understanding birth defects and
 

4909
01:22:53,699 --> 01:22:55,669
understanding birth defects and
neurobiology and cancer Immunology also

4910
01:22:55,669 --> 01:22:55,679
neurobiology and cancer Immunology also
 

4911
01:22:55,679 --> 01:22:58,250
neurobiology and cancer Immunology also
so you get the whole uh embryogenesis in

4912
01:22:58,250 --> 01:22:58,260
so you get the whole uh embryogenesis in
 

4913
01:22:58,260 --> 01:23:00,169
so you get the whole uh embryogenesis in
the pizza dish

4914
01:23:00,169 --> 01:23:00,179
the pizza dish
 

4915
01:23:00,179 --> 01:23:02,390
the pizza dish
that's so cool to watch Is there videos

4916
01:23:02,390 --> 01:23:02,400
that's so cool to watch Is there videos
 

4917
01:23:02,400 --> 01:23:04,130
that's so cool to watch Is there videos
of this oh yeah yeah there's been yeah

4918
01:23:04,130 --> 01:23:04,140
of this oh yeah yeah there's been yeah
 

4919
01:23:04,140 --> 01:23:06,050
of this oh yeah yeah there's been yeah
there's there's amazing videos on on

4920
01:23:06,050 --> 01:23:06,060
there's there's amazing videos on on
 

4921
01:23:06,060 --> 01:23:07,850
there's there's amazing videos on on
online I mean mammalian embryos are

4922
01:23:07,850 --> 01:23:07,860
online I mean mammalian embryos are
 

4923
01:23:07,860 --> 01:23:09,709
online I mean mammalian embryos are
super cool too for example monozygotic

4924
01:23:09,709 --> 01:23:09,719
super cool too for example monozygotic
 

4925
01:23:09,719 --> 01:23:11,330
super cool too for example monozygotic
twins are what happens when you cut a

4926
01:23:11,330 --> 01:23:11,340
twins are what happens when you cut a
 

4927
01:23:11,340 --> 01:23:13,189
twins are what happens when you cut a
mammalian embryo in half you don't get

4928
01:23:13,189 --> 01:23:13,199
mammalian embryo in half you don't get
 

4929
01:23:13,199 --> 01:23:14,870
mammalian embryo in half you don't get
two half bodies you get two perfectly

4930
01:23:14,870 --> 01:23:14,880
two half bodies you get two perfectly
 

4931
01:23:14,880 --> 01:23:16,070
two half bodies you get two perfectly
normal bodies because it's a

4932
01:23:16,070 --> 01:23:16,080
normal bodies because it's a
 

4933
01:23:16,080 --> 01:23:17,930
normal bodies because it's a
regeneration event right a development

4934
01:23:17,930 --> 01:23:17,940
regeneration event right a development
 

4935
01:23:17,940 --> 01:23:19,189
regeneration event right a development
is just it's just the kind of

4936
01:23:19,189 --> 01:23:19,199
is just it's just the kind of
 

4937
01:23:19,199 --> 01:23:21,050
is just it's just the kind of
regeneration really and why this

4938
01:23:21,050 --> 01:23:21,060
regeneration really and why this
 

4939
01:23:21,060 --> 01:23:24,110
regeneration really and why this
particular frog is just uh because they

4940
01:23:24,110 --> 01:23:24,120
particular frog is just uh because they
 

4941
01:23:24,120 --> 01:23:27,110
particular frog is just uh because they
were doing in the 50s and it breeds well

4942
01:23:27,110 --> 01:23:27,120
were doing in the 50s and it breeds well
 

4943
01:23:27,120 --> 01:23:29,870
were doing in the 50s and it breeds well
in um you know in in case it's easy to

4944
01:23:29,870 --> 01:23:29,880
in um you know in in case it's easy to
 

4945
01:23:29,880 --> 01:23:32,450
in um you know in in case it's easy to
raise in in the laboratory and uh it's

4946
01:23:32,450 --> 01:23:32,460
raise in in the laboratory and uh it's
 

4947
01:23:32,460 --> 01:23:34,490
raise in in the laboratory and uh it's
very prolific and all the tools

4948
01:23:34,490 --> 01:23:34,500
very prolific and all the tools
 

4949
01:23:34,500 --> 01:23:35,990
very prolific and all the tools
basically for decades people have been

4950
01:23:35,990 --> 01:23:36,000
basically for decades people have been
 

4951
01:23:36,000 --> 01:23:37,669
basically for decades people have been
developing tools there's other some

4952
01:23:37,669 --> 01:23:37,679
developing tools there's other some
 

4953
01:23:37,679 --> 01:23:39,290
developing tools there's other some
people use other frogs but I have to say

4954
01:23:39,290 --> 01:23:39,300
people use other frogs but I have to say
 

4955
01:23:39,300 --> 01:23:40,790
people use other frogs but I have to say
this is this is this is important

4956
01:23:40,790 --> 01:23:40,800
this is this is this is important
 

4957
01:23:40,800 --> 01:23:43,310
this is this is this is important
xenobots are fundamentally not anything

4958
01:23:43,310 --> 01:23:43,320
xenobots are fundamentally not anything
 

4959
01:23:43,320 --> 01:23:45,050
xenobots are fundamentally not anything
about frogs so

4960
01:23:45,050 --> 01:23:45,060
about frogs so
 

4961
01:23:45,060 --> 01:23:46,370
about frogs so
um I I can't say too much about this

4962
01:23:46,370 --> 01:23:46,380
um I I can't say too much about this
 

4963
01:23:46,380 --> 01:23:47,390
um I I can't say too much about this
because it's not published and

4964
01:23:47,390 --> 01:23:47,400
because it's not published and
 

4965
01:23:47,400 --> 01:23:49,010
because it's not published and
peer-reviewed yet but we've made

4966
01:23:49,010 --> 01:23:49,020
peer-reviewed yet but we've made
 

4967
01:23:49,020 --> 01:23:50,870
peer-reviewed yet but we've made
xenobots out of other things that have

4968
01:23:50,870 --> 01:23:50,880
xenobots out of other things that have
 

4969
01:23:50,880 --> 01:23:52,370
xenobots out of other things that have
nothing to do with frogs it's this is

4970
01:23:52,370 --> 01:23:52,380
nothing to do with frogs it's this is
 

4971
01:23:52,380 --> 01:23:54,290
nothing to do with frogs it's this is
not a frog phenomenon this is it we

4972
01:23:54,290 --> 01:23:54,300
not a frog phenomenon this is it we
 

4973
01:23:54,300 --> 01:23:55,610
not a frog phenomenon this is it we
started with frog because it's so

4974
01:23:55,610 --> 01:23:55,620
started with frog because it's so
 

4975
01:23:55,620 --> 01:23:58,189
started with frog because it's so
convenient but this this plasticity is

4976
01:23:58,189 --> 01:23:58,199
convenient but this this plasticity is
 

4977
01:23:58,199 --> 01:23:59,810
convenient but this this plasticity is
not a fraud you know it's not related to

4978
01:23:59,810 --> 01:23:59,820
not a fraud you know it's not related to
 

4979
01:23:59,820 --> 01:24:01,910
not a fraud you know it's not related to
the fact that their frogs what happens

4980
01:24:01,910 --> 01:24:01,920
the fact that their frogs what happens
 

4981
01:24:01,920 --> 01:24:03,530
the fact that their frogs what happens
when you kiss it does it turn to a

4982
01:24:03,530 --> 01:24:03,540
when you kiss it does it turn to a
 

4983
01:24:03,540 --> 01:24:06,050
when you kiss it does it turn to a
prince no or princess which way uh

4984
01:24:06,050 --> 01:24:06,060
prince no or princess which way uh
 

4985
01:24:06,060 --> 01:24:08,450
prince no or princess which way uh
Prince yeah princess yeah that's an

4986
01:24:08,450 --> 01:24:08,460
Prince yeah princess yeah that's an
 

4987
01:24:08,460 --> 01:24:10,070
Prince yeah princess yeah that's an
experiment I don't believe we've done

4988
01:24:10,070 --> 01:24:10,080
experiment I don't believe we've done
 

4989
01:24:10,080 --> 01:24:11,390
experiment I don't believe we've done
and if we have I don't know we'll

4990
01:24:11,390 --> 01:24:11,400
and if we have I don't know we'll
 

4991
01:24:11,400 --> 01:24:13,669
and if we have I don't know we'll
collaborate I can I can take on the lead

4992
01:24:13,669 --> 01:24:13,679
collaborate I can I can take on the lead
 

4993
01:24:13,679 --> 01:24:18,290
collaborate I can I can take on the lead
uh on that effort okay cool uh how does

4994
01:24:18,290 --> 01:24:18,300
uh on that effort okay cool uh how does
 

4995
01:24:18,300 --> 01:24:20,390
uh on that effort okay cool uh how does
the cells coordinate let's focus in on

4996
01:24:20,390 --> 01:24:20,400
the cells coordinate let's focus in on
 

4997
01:24:20,400 --> 01:24:23,209
the cells coordinate let's focus in on
just the embryogenesis so there's one

4998
01:24:23,209 --> 01:24:23,219
just the embryogenesis so there's one
 

4999
01:24:23,219 --> 01:24:24,229
just the embryogenesis so there's one
cell

5000
01:24:24,229 --> 01:24:24,239
cell
 

5001
01:24:24,239 --> 01:24:26,930
cell
so it divides doesn't have to be very

5002
01:24:26,930 --> 01:24:26,940
so it divides doesn't have to be very
 

5003
01:24:26,940 --> 01:24:31,189
so it divides doesn't have to be very
careful about what each cell starts

5004
01:24:31,189 --> 01:24:31,199
careful about what each cell starts
 

5005
01:24:31,199 --> 01:24:34,130
careful about what each cell starts
doing once they divide yes and like yeah

5006
01:24:34,130 --> 01:24:34,140
doing once they divide yes and like yeah
 

5007
01:24:34,140 --> 01:24:36,350
doing once they divide yes and like yeah
when there's three of them it's like the

5008
01:24:36,350 --> 01:24:36,360
when there's three of them it's like the
 

5009
01:24:36,360 --> 01:24:39,229
when there's three of them it's like the
co-founders or whatever like what like

5010
01:24:39,229 --> 01:24:39,239
co-founders or whatever like what like
 

5011
01:24:39,239 --> 01:24:42,169
co-founders or whatever like what like
slow down you're responsible for this

5012
01:24:42,169 --> 01:24:42,179
slow down you're responsible for this
 

5013
01:24:42,179 --> 01:24:44,750
slow down you're responsible for this
when do they become specialized and how

5014
01:24:44,750 --> 01:24:44,760
when do they become specialized and how
 

5015
01:24:44,760 --> 01:24:46,490
when do they become specialized and how
do they coordinate that specialization

5016
01:24:46,490 --> 01:24:46,500
do they coordinate that specialization
 

5017
01:24:46,500 --> 01:24:49,189
do they coordinate that specialization
so so this is the the basic science of

5018
01:24:49,189 --> 01:24:49,199
so so this is the the basic science of
 

5019
01:24:49,199 --> 01:24:50,570
so so this is the the basic science of
Developmental biology there's a lot

5020
01:24:50,570 --> 01:24:50,580
Developmental biology there's a lot
 

5021
01:24:50,580 --> 01:24:52,970
Developmental biology there's a lot
known about all of that but um but what

5022
01:24:52,970 --> 01:24:52,980
known about all of that but um but what
 

5023
01:24:52,980 --> 01:24:55,370
known about all of that but um but what
I'll tell you what I think is the kind

5024
01:24:55,370 --> 01:24:55,380
I'll tell you what I think is the kind
 

5025
01:24:55,380 --> 01:24:57,649
I'll tell you what I think is the kind
of the most important part which is yes

5026
01:24:57,649 --> 01:24:57,659
of the most important part which is yes
 

5027
01:24:57,659 --> 01:24:59,810
of the most important part which is yes
it's very important who does what

5028
01:24:59,810 --> 01:24:59,820
it's very important who does what
 

5029
01:24:59,820 --> 01:25:02,930
it's very important who does what
however because going back to this issue

5030
01:25:02,930 --> 01:25:02,940
however because going back to this issue
 

5031
01:25:02,940 --> 01:25:05,570
however because going back to this issue
of of well I made this claim that

5032
01:25:05,570 --> 01:25:05,580
of of well I made this claim that
 

5033
01:25:05,580 --> 01:25:07,910
of of well I made this claim that
um biology doesn't take the past too

5034
01:25:07,910 --> 01:25:07,920
um biology doesn't take the past too
 

5035
01:25:07,920 --> 01:25:10,250
um biology doesn't take the past too
seriously and what I mean by that is it

5036
01:25:10,250 --> 01:25:10,260
seriously and what I mean by that is it
 

5037
01:25:10,260 --> 01:25:12,229
seriously and what I mean by that is it
doesn't assume that everything is the

5038
01:25:12,229 --> 01:25:12,239
doesn't assume that everything is the
 

5039
01:25:12,239 --> 01:25:14,510
doesn't assume that everything is the
way it's it's expected to be right and

5040
01:25:14,510 --> 01:25:14,520
way it's it's expected to be right and
 

5041
01:25:14,520 --> 01:25:16,189
way it's it's expected to be right and
here's an example of that

5042
01:25:16,189 --> 01:25:16,199
here's an example of that
 

5043
01:25:16,199 --> 01:25:17,630
here's an example of that
um this was this was done this was this

5044
01:25:17,630 --> 01:25:17,640
um this was this was done this was this
 

5045
01:25:17,640 --> 01:25:18,950
um this was this was done this was this
was an old experiment going back to the

5046
01:25:18,950 --> 01:25:18,960
was an old experiment going back to the
 

5047
01:25:18,960 --> 01:25:22,130
was an old experiment going back to the
40s but um basically imagine it's a newt

5048
01:25:22,130 --> 01:25:22,140
40s but um basically imagine it's a newt
 

5049
01:25:22,140 --> 01:25:24,229
40s but um basically imagine it's a newt
the salamander it's got these little two

5050
01:25:24,229 --> 01:25:24,239
the salamander it's got these little two
 

5051
01:25:24,239 --> 01:25:25,850
the salamander it's got these little two
tubules that go to the kidneys right

5052
01:25:25,850 --> 01:25:25,860
tubules that go to the kidneys right
 

5053
01:25:25,860 --> 01:25:27,350
tubules that go to the kidneys right
there's a little tube take a cross

5054
01:25:27,350 --> 01:25:27,360
there's a little tube take a cross
 

5055
01:25:27,360 --> 01:25:28,850
there's a little tube take a cross
section of that tube you see eight to

5056
01:25:28,850 --> 01:25:28,860
section of that tube you see eight to
 

5057
01:25:28,860 --> 01:25:31,250
section of that tube you see eight to
ten cells that have cooperated to make

5058
01:25:31,250 --> 01:25:31,260
ten cells that have cooperated to make
 

5059
01:25:31,260 --> 01:25:32,689
ten cells that have cooperated to make
this little tube and cross-section right

5060
01:25:32,689 --> 01:25:32,699
this little tube and cross-section right
 

5061
01:25:32,699 --> 01:25:35,750
this little tube and cross-section right
so one amazing one amazing thing you can

5062
01:25:35,750 --> 01:25:35,760
so one amazing one amazing thing you can
 

5063
01:25:35,760 --> 01:25:37,189
so one amazing one amazing thing you can
do is

5064
01:25:37,189 --> 01:25:37,199
do is
 

5065
01:25:37,199 --> 01:25:39,590
do is
um you can you can mess with the very

5066
01:25:39,590 --> 01:25:39,600
um you can you can mess with the very
 

5067
01:25:39,600 --> 01:25:41,330
um you can you can mess with the very
early cell division to make the cells

5068
01:25:41,330 --> 01:25:41,340
early cell division to make the cells
 

5069
01:25:41,340 --> 01:25:42,890
early cell division to make the cells
gigantic bigger you can you can make

5070
01:25:42,890 --> 01:25:42,900
gigantic bigger you can you can make
 

5071
01:25:42,900 --> 01:25:44,149
gigantic bigger you can you can make
them different sizes you can force them

5072
01:25:44,149 --> 01:25:44,159
them different sizes you can force them
 

5073
01:25:44,159 --> 01:25:47,090
them different sizes you can force them
to be different sizes so if you make the

5074
01:25:47,090 --> 01:25:47,100
to be different sizes so if you make the
 

5075
01:25:47,100 --> 01:25:49,250
to be different sizes so if you make the
cells different sizes the Whole Nude is

5076
01:25:49,250 --> 01:25:49,260
cells different sizes the Whole Nude is
 

5077
01:25:49,260 --> 01:25:51,050
cells different sizes the Whole Nude is
still the same size so if you take a

5078
01:25:51,050 --> 01:25:51,060
still the same size so if you take a
 

5079
01:25:51,060 --> 01:25:52,550
still the same size so if you take a
cross section through the through that

5080
01:25:52,550 --> 01:25:52,560
cross section through the through that
 

5081
01:25:52,560 --> 01:25:54,410
cross section through the through that
tubule instead of eight to ten cells you

5082
01:25:54,410 --> 01:25:54,420
tubule instead of eight to ten cells you
 

5083
01:25:54,420 --> 01:25:55,729
tubule instead of eight to ten cells you
might have four or five or you might

5084
01:25:55,729 --> 01:25:55,739
might have four or five or you might
 

5085
01:25:55,739 --> 01:25:58,490
might have four or five or you might
have you know three until you make the

5086
01:25:58,490 --> 01:25:58,500
have you know three until you make the
 

5087
01:25:58,500 --> 01:26:01,610
have you know three until you make the
cells so enormous that one single cell

5088
01:26:01,610 --> 01:26:01,620
cells so enormous that one single cell
 

5089
01:26:01,620 --> 01:26:03,950
cells so enormous that one single cell
wraps around itself

5090
01:26:03,950 --> 01:26:03,960
wraps around itself
 

5091
01:26:03,960 --> 01:26:06,229
wraps around itself
and and gives you that same large-scale

5092
01:26:06,229 --> 01:26:06,239
and and gives you that same large-scale
 

5093
01:26:06,239 --> 01:26:07,669
and and gives you that same large-scale
structure by a completely different

5094
01:26:07,669 --> 01:26:07,679
structure by a completely different
 

5095
01:26:07,679 --> 01:26:09,649
structure by a completely different
molecular mechanism so now instead of

5096
01:26:09,649 --> 01:26:09,659
molecular mechanism so now instead of
 

5097
01:26:09,659 --> 01:26:11,629
molecular mechanism so now instead of
cell to cell communication to make a

5098
01:26:11,629 --> 01:26:11,639
cell to cell communication to make a
 

5099
01:26:11,639 --> 01:26:13,610
cell to cell communication to make a
tubule instead of that it's one cell

5100
01:26:13,610 --> 01:26:13,620
tubule instead of that it's one cell
 

5101
01:26:13,620 --> 01:26:15,470
tubule instead of that it's one cell
using the cytoskeleton to bend itself

5102
01:26:15,470 --> 01:26:15,480
using the cytoskeleton to bend itself
 

5103
01:26:15,480 --> 01:26:17,149
using the cytoskeleton to bend itself
around so think about what that means in

5104
01:26:17,149 --> 01:26:17,159
around so think about what that means in
 

5105
01:26:17,159 --> 01:26:19,669
around so think about what that means in
the service of a large scale it talk

5106
01:26:19,669 --> 01:26:19,679
the service of a large scale it talk
 

5107
01:26:19,679 --> 01:26:21,050
the service of a large scale it talk
about top-down control right and the

5108
01:26:21,050 --> 01:26:21,060
about top-down control right and the
 

5109
01:26:21,060 --> 01:26:22,850
about top-down control right and the
service of a large scale anatomical

5110
01:26:22,850 --> 01:26:22,860
service of a large scale anatomical
 

5111
01:26:22,860 --> 01:26:24,950
service of a large scale anatomical
feature different molecular mechanisms

5112
01:26:24,950 --> 01:26:24,960
feature different molecular mechanisms
 

5113
01:26:24,960 --> 01:26:27,050
feature different molecular mechanisms
get called up so now think about this

5114
01:26:27,050 --> 01:26:27,060
get called up so now think about this
 

5115
01:26:27,060 --> 01:26:28,790
get called up so now think about this
you're you're you're you're a nude

5116
01:26:28,790 --> 01:26:28,800
you're you're you're you're a nude
 

5117
01:26:28,800 --> 01:26:30,890
you're you're you're you're a nude
selling trying to make an embryo if you

5118
01:26:30,890 --> 01:26:30,900
selling trying to make an embryo if you
 

5119
01:26:30,900 --> 01:26:32,629
selling trying to make an embryo if you
had a fixed idea of who was supposed to

5120
01:26:32,629 --> 01:26:32,639
had a fixed idea of who was supposed to
 

5121
01:26:32,639 --> 01:26:34,310
had a fixed idea of who was supposed to
do what you'd be screwed because now

5122
01:26:34,310 --> 01:26:34,320
do what you'd be screwed because now
 

5123
01:26:34,320 --> 01:26:35,750
do what you'd be screwed because now
your cells are gigantic nothing would

5124
01:26:35,750 --> 01:26:35,760
your cells are gigantic nothing would
 

5125
01:26:35,760 --> 01:26:38,570
your cells are gigantic nothing would
work the there's an incredible tolerance

5126
01:26:38,570 --> 01:26:38,580
work the there's an incredible tolerance
 

5127
01:26:38,580 --> 01:26:41,209
work the there's an incredible tolerance
for changes in the size of the parts in

the life is highly interoperable you can
put electrodes in there you can put

01:26:48,350 --> 01:26:48,360
put electrodes in there you can put
 

5137
01:26:48,360 --> 01:26:50,750
put electrodes in there you can put
weird nanomaterials it still works it's

5138
01:26:50,750 --> 01:26:50,760
weird nanomaterials it still works it's
 

5139
01:26:50,760 --> 01:26:52,970
weird nanomaterials it still works it's
it's uh this is that problem solving

5140
01:26:52,970 --> 01:26:52,980
it's uh this is that problem solving
 

5141
01:26:52,980 --> 01:26:54,649
it's uh this is that problem solving
action right it's able to do what it

5142
01:26:54,649 --> 01:26:54,659
action right it's able to do what it
 

5143
01:26:54,659 --> 01:26:56,149
action right it's able to do what it
needs to do even when circumstances

5144
01:26:56,149 --> 01:26:56,159
needs to do even when circumstances
 

5145
01:26:56,159 --> 01:26:59,810
needs to do even when circumstances
change that is you know uh the Hallmark

5146
01:26:59,810 --> 01:26:59,820
change that is you know uh the Hallmark
 

5147
01:26:59,820 --> 01:27:01,010
change that is you know uh the Hallmark
of intelligence right William James

5148
01:27:01,010 --> 01:27:01,020
of intelligence right William James
 

5149
01:27:01,020 --> 01:27:03,050
of intelligence right William James
defined intelligence as the ability to

5150
01:27:03,050 --> 01:27:03,060
defined intelligence as the ability to
 

5151
01:27:03,060 --> 01:27:04,610
defined intelligence as the ability to
get to the same goal by different means

5152
01:27:04,610 --> 01:27:04,620
get to the same goal by different means
 

5153
01:27:04,620 --> 01:27:06,770
get to the same goal by different means
that's this you get to the same goal by

5154
01:27:06,770 --> 01:27:06,780
that's this you get to the same goal by
 

5155
01:27:06,780 --> 01:27:09,590
that's this you get to the same goal by
completely different means and so so why

5156
01:27:09,590 --> 01:27:09,600
completely different means and so so why
 

5157
01:27:09,600 --> 01:27:10,729
completely different means and so so why
am I bringing this up is just to say

5158
01:27:10,729 --> 01:27:10,739
am I bringing this up is just to say
 

5159
01:27:10,739 --> 01:27:12,290
am I bringing this up is just to say
that yeah it's important for the cells

5160
01:27:12,290 --> 01:27:12,300
that yeah it's important for the cells
 

5161
01:27:12,300 --> 01:27:14,030
that yeah it's important for the cells
to do the right stuff but they have

5162
01:27:14,030 --> 01:27:14,040
to do the right stuff but they have
 

5163
01:27:14,040 --> 01:27:16,010
to do the right stuff but they have
incredible tolerances for things not

5164
01:27:16,010 --> 01:27:16,020
incredible tolerances for things not
 

5165
01:27:16,020 --> 01:27:17,990
incredible tolerances for things not
being what you expect and to still get

5166
01:27:17,990 --> 01:27:18,000
being what you expect and to still get
 

5167
01:27:18,000 --> 01:27:21,050
being what you expect and to still get
their job done so if you're you know all

5168
01:27:21,050 --> 01:27:21,060
their job done so if you're you know all
 

5169
01:27:21,060 --> 01:27:24,350
their job done so if you're you know all
of these things are not hardwired there

5170
01:27:24,350 --> 01:27:24,360
of these things are not hardwired there
 

5171
01:27:24,360 --> 01:27:25,850
of these things are not hardwired there
are organisms that might be hardwired

5172
01:27:25,850 --> 01:27:25,860
are organisms that might be hardwired
 

5173
01:27:25,860 --> 01:27:28,370
are organisms that might be hardwired
for example the nematode C elegans in

5174
01:27:28,370 --> 01:27:28,380
for example the nematode C elegans in
 

5175
01:27:28,380 --> 01:27:30,290
for example the nematode C elegans in
that organism every cell is numbered

5176
01:27:30,290 --> 01:27:30,300
that organism every cell is numbered
 

5177
01:27:30,300 --> 01:27:31,970
that organism every cell is numbered
meaning that every AC Elegance has

5178
01:27:31,970 --> 01:27:31,980
meaning that every AC Elegance has
 

5179
01:27:31,980 --> 01:27:33,169
meaning that every AC Elegance has
exactly the same number of cells as

5180
01:27:33,169 --> 01:27:33,179
exactly the same number of cells as
 

5181
01:27:33,179 --> 01:27:34,550
exactly the same number of cells as
every other C elegans they're all in the

5182
01:27:34,550 --> 01:27:34,560
every other C elegans they're all in the
 

5183
01:27:34,560 --> 01:27:35,570
every other C elegans they're all in the
same place they all divide there's

5184
01:27:35,570 --> 01:27:35,580
same place they all divide there's
 

5185
01:27:35,580 --> 01:27:37,669
same place they all divide there's
literally a map of how it works that in

5186
01:27:37,669 --> 01:27:37,679
literally a map of how it works that in
 

5187
01:27:37,679 --> 01:27:39,709
literally a map of how it works that in
that in that sort of system it's it's

5188
01:27:39,709 --> 01:27:39,719
that in that sort of system it's it's
 

5189
01:27:39,719 --> 01:27:42,110
that in that sort of system it's it's
much more cookie cutter but but most

5190
01:27:42,110 --> 01:27:42,120
much more cookie cutter but but most
 

5191
01:27:42,120 --> 01:27:44,870
much more cookie cutter but but most
most organisms are incredibly plastic in

5192
01:27:44,870 --> 01:27:44,880
most organisms are incredibly plastic in
 

5193
01:27:44,880 --> 01:27:47,930
most organisms are incredibly plastic in
that way is there something particularly

5194
01:27:47,930 --> 01:27:47,940
that way is there something particularly
 

5195
01:27:47,940 --> 01:27:49,490
that way is there something particularly
magical to you about the whole

5196
01:27:49,490 --> 01:27:49,500
magical to you about the whole
 

5197
01:27:49,500 --> 01:27:52,610
magical to you about the whole
developmental biology process

5198
01:27:52,610 --> 01:27:52,620
developmental biology process
 

5199
01:27:52,620 --> 01:27:54,530
developmental biology process
is there something you could say because

5200
01:27:54,530 --> 01:27:54,540
is there something you could say because
 

5201
01:27:54,540 --> 01:27:56,629
is there something you could say because
you just said it they're very good at

5202
01:27:56,629 --> 01:27:56,639
you just said it they're very good at
 

5203
01:27:56,639 --> 01:27:58,250
you just said it they're very good at
accomplishing the goal of the job they

5204
01:27:58,250 --> 01:27:58,260
accomplishing the goal of the job they
 

5205
01:27:58,260 --> 01:28:01,070
accomplishing the goal of the job they
need to do the competency thing but you

5206
01:28:01,070 --> 01:28:01,080
need to do the competency thing but you
 

5207
01:28:01,080 --> 01:28:04,129
need to do the competency thing but you
get freaking organism for one cell

5208
01:28:04,129 --> 01:28:04,139
get freaking organism for one cell
 

5209
01:28:04,139 --> 01:28:06,649
get freaking organism for one cell
it's like uh

5210
01:28:06,649 --> 01:28:06,659
it's like uh
 

5211
01:28:06,659 --> 01:28:08,629
it's like uh
it's very hard

5212
01:28:08,629 --> 01:28:08,639
it's very hard
 

5213
01:28:08,639 --> 01:28:11,930
it's very hard
to Intuit that whole process

5214
01:28:11,930 --> 01:28:11,940
to Intuit that whole process
 

5215
01:28:11,940 --> 01:28:14,149
to Intuit that whole process
to even think about reverse engineering

5216
01:28:14,149 --> 01:28:14,159
to even think about reverse engineering
 

5217
01:28:14,159 --> 01:28:16,490
to even think about reverse engineering
that process right they're very hard to

5218
01:28:16,490 --> 01:28:16,500
that process right they're very hard to
 

5219
01:28:16,500 --> 01:28:19,010
that process right they're very hard to
the point where I often just imagine I I

5220
01:28:19,010 --> 01:28:19,020
the point where I often just imagine I I
 

5221
01:28:19,020 --> 01:28:20,629
the point where I often just imagine I I
sometimes ask my students to do this

5222
01:28:20,629 --> 01:28:20,639
sometimes ask my students to do this
 

5223
01:28:20,639 --> 01:28:22,010
sometimes ask my students to do this
thought experiment imagine you were you

5224
01:28:22,010 --> 01:28:22,020
thought experiment imagine you were you
 

5225
01:28:22,020 --> 01:28:23,990
thought experiment imagine you were you
were shrunk down to the to the scale of

5226
01:28:23,990 --> 01:28:24,000
were shrunk down to the to the scale of
 

5227
01:28:24,000 --> 01:28:25,370
were shrunk down to the to the scale of
a single cell and you were in the middle

5228
01:28:25,370 --> 01:28:25,380
a single cell and you were in the middle
 

5229
01:28:25,380 --> 01:28:26,629
a single cell and you were in the middle
of an embryo and you were looking around

5230
01:28:26,629 --> 01:28:26,639
of an embryo and you were looking around
 

5231
01:28:26,639 --> 01:28:28,370
of an embryo and you were looking around
at what's going on and the cells running

5232
01:28:28,370 --> 01:28:28,380
at what's going on and the cells running
 

5233
01:28:28,380 --> 01:28:29,990
at what's going on and the cells running
around some cells are dying it you know

5234
01:28:29,990 --> 01:28:30,000
around some cells are dying it you know
 

5235
01:28:30,000 --> 01:28:31,070
around some cells are dying it you know
every time you look it's kind of a

5236
01:28:31,070 --> 01:28:31,080
every time you look it's kind of a
 

5237
01:28:31,080 --> 01:28:32,390
every time you look it's kind of a
different number of cells for most

5238
01:28:32,390 --> 01:28:32,400
different number of cells for most
 

5239
01:28:32,400 --> 01:28:35,330
different number of cells for most
organisms and so I think that if you

5240
01:28:35,330 --> 01:28:35,340
organisms and so I think that if you
 

5241
01:28:35,340 --> 01:28:36,830
organisms and so I think that if you
didn't know what embryonic development

5242
01:28:36,830 --> 01:28:36,840
didn't know what embryonic development
 

5243
01:28:36,840 --> 01:28:39,050
didn't know what embryonic development
was you would have no clue that what

5244
01:28:39,050 --> 01:28:39,060
was you would have no clue that what
 

5245
01:28:39,060 --> 01:28:40,490
was you would have no clue that what
you're seeing is always going to make

5246
01:28:40,490 --> 01:28:40,500
you're seeing is always going to make
 

5247
01:28:40,500 --> 01:28:42,229
you're seeing is always going to make
the same thing never mind knowing what

5248
01:28:42,229 --> 01:28:42,239
the same thing never mind knowing what
 

5249
01:28:42,239 --> 01:28:44,030
the same thing never mind knowing what
that what that is never mind being able

5250
01:28:44,030 --> 01:28:44,040
that what that is never mind being able
 

5251
01:28:44,040 --> 01:28:45,590
that what that is never mind being able
to say even with full genomic

5252
01:28:45,590 --> 01:28:45,600
to say even with full genomic
 

5253
01:28:45,600 --> 01:28:46,850
to say even with full genomic
information being able to say what the

5254
01:28:46,850 --> 01:28:46,860
information being able to say what the
 

5255
01:28:46,860 --> 01:28:48,530
information being able to say what the
hell are they building we have no way to

5256
01:28:48,530 --> 01:28:48,540
hell are they building we have no way to
 

5257
01:28:48,540 --> 01:28:50,810
hell are they building we have no way to
do that but but just even to Guess that

5258
01:28:50,810 --> 01:28:50,820
do that but but just even to Guess that
 

5259
01:28:50,820 --> 01:28:52,850
do that but but just even to Guess that
wow the the the outcome of all this

5260
01:28:52,850 --> 01:28:52,860
wow the the the outcome of all this
 

5261
01:28:52,860 --> 01:28:55,669
wow the the the outcome of all this
activity is it's always going to be it's

5262
01:28:55,669 --> 01:28:55,679
activity is it's always going to be it's
 

5263
01:28:55,679 --> 01:28:57,410
activity is it's always going to be it's
always going to build the same thing the

5264
01:28:57,410 --> 01:28:57,420
always going to build the same thing the
 

5265
01:28:57,420 --> 01:29:00,649
always going to build the same thing the
imperative to create the final you as

5266
01:29:00,649 --> 01:29:00,659
imperative to create the final you as
 

5267
01:29:00,659 --> 01:29:03,050
imperative to create the final you as
you are now is there already

5268
01:29:03,050 --> 01:29:03,060
you are now is there already
 

5269
01:29:03,060 --> 01:29:05,390
you are now is there already
so you can you would so if you start

5270
01:29:05,390 --> 01:29:05,400
so you can you would so if you start
 

5271
01:29:05,400 --> 01:29:08,030
so you can you would so if you start
from the same embryo you create a very

5272
01:29:08,030 --> 01:29:08,040
from the same embryo you create a very
 

5273
01:29:08,040 --> 01:29:09,950
from the same embryo you create a very
similar organism

5274
01:29:09,950 --> 01:29:09,960
similar organism
 

5275
01:29:09,960 --> 01:29:13,250
similar organism
yeah on except for cases like the

5276
01:29:13,250 --> 01:29:13,260
yeah on except for cases like the
 

5277
01:29:13,260 --> 01:29:15,050
yeah on except for cases like the
xenobots when you give them a different

5278
01:29:15,050 --> 01:29:15,060
xenobots when you give them a different
 

5279
01:29:15,060 --> 01:29:16,310
xenobots when you give them a different
environment they come up with a

5280
01:29:16,310 --> 01:29:16,320
environment they come up with a
 

5281
01:29:16,320 --> 01:29:17,810
environment they come up with a
different way to be adaptive in that

5282
01:29:17,810 --> 01:29:17,820
different way to be adaptive in that
 

5283
01:29:17,820 --> 01:29:20,030
different way to be adaptive in that
environment but overall I mean so so I

5284
01:29:20,030 --> 01:29:20,040
environment but overall I mean so so I
 

5285
01:29:20,040 --> 01:29:22,850
environment but overall I mean so so I
think so I think to you know kind of

5286
01:29:22,850 --> 01:29:22,860
think so I think to you know kind of
 

5287
01:29:22,860 --> 01:29:25,010
think so I think to you know kind of
um uh summarize it I think what

5288
01:29:25,010 --> 01:29:25,020
um uh summarize it I think what
 

5289
01:29:25,020 --> 01:29:27,830
um uh summarize it I think what
evolution is really good at is creating

5290
01:29:27,830 --> 01:29:27,840
evolution is really good at is creating
 

5291
01:29:27,840 --> 01:29:31,669

you've talked about the magic and the

5316
01:29:54,770 --> 01:29:54,780
you've talked about the magic and the
 

5317
01:29:54,780 --> 01:29:57,350
you've talked about the magic and the
power of biology here if we look at the

5318
01:29:57,350 --> 01:29:57,360
power of biology here if we look at the
 

5319
01:29:57,360 --> 01:29:59,390
power of biology here if we look at the
human brain how special is the brain in

5320
01:29:59,390 --> 01:29:59,400
human brain how special is the brain in
 

5321
01:29:59,400 --> 01:30:01,550
human brain how special is the brain in
this context you're kind of minimizing

5322
01:30:01,550 --> 01:30:01,560
this context you're kind of minimizing
 

5323
01:30:01,560 --> 01:30:04,490
this context you're kind of minimizing
the importance of the brain or lessening

5324
01:30:04,490 --> 01:30:04,500
the importance of the brain or lessening
 

5325
01:30:04,500 --> 01:30:07,010
the importance of the brain or lessening
it's we think of all the special

5326
01:30:07,010 --> 01:30:07,020
it's we think of all the special
 

5327
01:30:07,020 --> 01:30:08,450
it's we think of all the special
computation happens in the brain

5328
01:30:08,450 --> 01:30:08,460
computation happens in the brain
 

5329
01:30:08,460 --> 01:30:11,689
computation happens in the brain
everything else is like the help

5330
01:30:11,689 --> 01:30:11,699
everything else is like the help
 

5331
01:30:11,699 --> 01:30:13,430
everything else is like the help
you're kind of saying that the whole

5332
01:30:13,430 --> 01:30:13,440
you're kind of saying that the whole
 

5333
01:30:13,440 --> 01:30:15,470
you're kind of saying that the whole
thing is the whole thing is doing

5334
01:30:15,470 --> 01:30:15,480
thing is the whole thing is doing
 

5335
01:30:15,480 --> 01:30:17,110
thing is the whole thing is doing
computation

5336
01:30:17,110 --> 01:30:17,120
computation
 

5337
01:30:17,120 --> 01:30:19,910
computation
but nevertheless how special is the

5338
01:30:19,910 --> 01:30:19,920
but nevertheless how special is the
 

5339
01:30:19,920 --> 01:30:22,310
but nevertheless how special is the
human brain in this full context of

5340
01:30:22,310 --> 01:30:22,320
human brain in this full context of
 

5341
01:30:22,320 --> 01:30:25,129
human brain in this full context of
biology yeah I mean look there's no

5342
01:30:25,129 --> 01:30:25,139
biology yeah I mean look there's no
 

5343
01:30:25,139 --> 01:30:26,750
biology yeah I mean look there's no
getting away from the fact that the

5344
01:30:26,750 --> 01:30:26,760
getting away from the fact that the
 

5345
01:30:26,760 --> 01:30:29,209
getting away from the fact that the
human brain allows us to do things that

5346
01:30:29,209 --> 01:30:29,219
human brain allows us to do things that
 

5347
01:30:29,219 --> 01:30:30,770
human brain allows us to do things that
we could not do without it you can say

5348
01:30:30,770 --> 01:30:30,780
we could not do without it you can say
 

5349
01:30:30,780 --> 01:30:34,990
we could not do without it you can say
the same thing about the liver

5350
01:30:34,990 --> 01:30:35,000

 

5351
01:30:35,000 --> 01:30:37,669

this is true and so and so you know I I

5352
01:30:37,669 --> 01:30:37,679
this is true and so and so you know I I
 

5353
01:30:37,679 --> 01:30:39,770
this is true and so and so you know I I
my goal is not no you're right my goal

5354
01:30:39,770 --> 01:30:39,780
my goal is not no you're right my goal
 

5355
01:30:39,780 --> 01:30:41,390
my goal is not no you're right my goal
is you're just being polite to the brain

5356
01:30:41,390 --> 01:30:41,400
is you're just being polite to the brain
 

5357
01:30:41,400 --> 01:30:43,550
is you're just being polite to the brain
right now well looking a politician like

5358
01:30:43,550 --> 01:30:43,560
right now well looking a politician like
 

5359
01:30:43,560 --> 01:30:45,950
right now well looking a politician like
listen everybody has everybody has a

5360
01:30:45,950 --> 01:30:45,960
listen everybody has everybody has a
 

5361
01:30:45,960 --> 01:30:47,689
listen everybody has everybody has a
role yeah and it's very important role

5362
01:30:47,689 --> 01:30:47,699
role yeah and it's very important role
 

5363
01:30:47,699 --> 01:30:49,310
role yeah and it's very important role
that's right we have to acknowledge the

5364
01:30:49,310 --> 01:30:49,320
that's right we have to acknowledge the
 

5365
01:30:49,320 --> 01:30:51,470
that's right we have to acknowledge the
importance of the brain you know there

5366
01:30:51,470 --> 01:30:51,480
importance of the brain you know there
 

5367
01:30:51,480 --> 01:30:54,530
importance of the brain you know there
are more than enough people who are um

5368
01:30:54,530 --> 01:30:54,540
are more than enough people who are um
 

5369
01:30:54,540 --> 01:30:57,050
are more than enough people who are um
cheerleading the the brain right so so I

5370
01:30:57,050 --> 01:30:57,060
cheerleading the the brain right so so I
 

5371
01:30:57,060 --> 01:30:59,810
cheerleading the the brain right so so I
I don't feel like uh nothing I say is

5372
01:30:59,810 --> 01:30:59,820
I don't feel like uh nothing I say is
 

5373
01:30:59,820 --> 01:31:01,250
I don't feel like uh nothing I say is
going to reduce people's excitement

5374
01:31:01,250 --> 01:31:01,260
going to reduce people's excitement
 

5375
01:31:01,260 --> 01:31:03,830
going to reduce people's excitement
about the human brain and so so I I

5376
01:31:03,830 --> 01:31:03,840
about the human brain and so so I I
 

5377
01:31:03,840 --> 01:31:06,350
about the human brain and so so I I
emphasize others credit I don't think it

5378
01:31:06,350 --> 01:31:06,360
emphasize others credit I don't think it
 

5379
01:31:06,360 --> 01:31:07,790
emphasize others credit I don't think it
gets too much credit I think other

5380
01:31:07,790 --> 01:31:07,800
gets too much credit I think other
 

5381
01:31:07,800 --> 01:31:09,350
gets too much credit I think other
things don't get enough credit I think

5382
01:31:09,350 --> 01:31:09,360
things don't get enough credit I think
 

5383
01:31:09,360 --> 01:31:11,570
things don't get enough credit I think
the brain is is the human brain is

5384
01:31:11,570 --> 01:31:11,580
the brain is is the human brain is
 

5385
01:31:11,580 --> 01:31:13,550
the brain is is the human brain is
incredible and special and all that I

5386
01:31:13,550 --> 01:31:13,560
incredible and special and all that I
 

5387
01:31:13,560 --> 01:31:15,530
incredible and special and all that I
think other things need more credit and

5388
01:31:15,530 --> 01:31:15,540
think other things need more credit and
 

5389
01:31:15,540 --> 01:31:17,510
think other things need more credit and
and I also think that

5390
01:31:17,510 --> 01:31:17,520
and I also think that
 

5391
01:31:17,520 --> 01:31:19,669
and I also think that
this and I'm sort of this way about

5392
01:31:19,669 --> 01:31:19,679
this and I'm sort of this way about
 

5393
01:31:19,679 --> 01:31:21,110
this and I'm sort of this way about
everything I don't like binary

5394
01:31:21,110 --> 01:31:21,120
everything I don't like binary
 

5395
01:31:21,120 --> 01:31:22,610
everything I don't like binary
categories but almost anything I like a

5396
01:31:22,610 --> 01:31:22,620
categories but almost anything I like a
 

5397
01:31:22,620 --> 01:31:24,470
categories but almost anything I like a
Continuum and the thing about the human

5398
01:31:24,470 --> 01:31:24,480
Continuum and the thing about the human
 

5399
01:31:24,480 --> 01:31:28,189
Continuum and the thing about the human
brain is that it by by accepting that as

5400
01:31:28,189 --> 01:31:28,199
brain is that it by by accepting that as
 

5401
01:31:28,199 --> 01:31:30,410
brain is that it by by accepting that as
as some kind of an important category or

5402
01:31:30,410 --> 01:31:30,420
as some kind of an important category or
 

5403
01:31:30,420 --> 01:31:34,370
as some kind of an important category or
essential um essential thing we end up

5404
01:31:34,370 --> 01:31:34,380
essential um essential thing we end up
 

5405
01:31:34,380 --> 01:31:36,410
essential um essential thing we end up
with all kinds of weird pseudo problems

5406
01:31:36,410 --> 01:31:36,420
with all kinds of weird pseudo problems
 

5407
01:31:36,420 --> 01:31:39,890
with all kinds of weird pseudo problems
and conundrum so for example uh when we

5408
01:31:39,890 --> 01:31:39,900
and conundrum so for example uh when we
 

5409
01:31:39,900 --> 01:31:41,090
and conundrum so for example uh when we
talk about it you know if you don't want

5410
01:31:41,090 --> 01:31:41,100
talk about it you know if you don't want
 

5411
01:31:41,100 --> 01:31:42,110
talk about it you know if you don't want
to talk about

5412
01:31:42,110 --> 01:31:42,120
to talk about
 

5413
01:31:42,120 --> 01:31:44,990
to talk about
um uh uh ethics and other other things

5414
01:31:44,990 --> 01:31:45,000
um uh uh ethics and other other things
 

5415
01:31:45,000 --> 01:31:47,689
um uh uh ethics and other other things
like that uh and and what you know this

5416
01:31:47,689 --> 01:31:47,699
like that uh and and what you know this
 

5417
01:31:47,699 --> 01:31:49,669
like that uh and and what you know this
this idea that surely if we look out

5418
01:31:49,669 --> 01:31:49,679
this idea that surely if we look out
 

5419
01:31:49,679 --> 01:31:51,530
this idea that surely if we look out
into the universe surely we don't

5420
01:31:51,530 --> 01:31:51,540
into the universe surely we don't
 

5421
01:31:51,540 --> 01:31:53,390
into the universe surely we don't
believe that this human brain is the

5422
01:31:53,390 --> 01:31:53,400
believe that this human brain is the
 

5423
01:31:53,400 --> 01:31:55,370
believe that this human brain is the
only way to be sentient right surely we

5424
01:31:55,370 --> 01:31:55,380
only way to be sentient right surely we
 

5425
01:31:55,380 --> 01:31:56,450
only way to be sentient right surely we
don't you know and to have high level

5426
01:31:56,450 --> 01:31:56,460
don't you know and to have high level
 

5427
01:31:56,460 --> 01:31:59,209
don't you know and to have high level
cognition I just I can't even wrap my

5428
01:31:59,209 --> 01:31:59,219
cognition I just I can't even wrap my
 

5429
01:31:59,219 --> 01:32:00,770
cognition I just I can't even wrap my
mind around this this idea that that is

5430
01:32:00,770 --> 01:32:00,780
mind around this this idea that that is
 

5431
01:32:00,780 --> 01:32:02,870
mind around this this idea that that is
the only way to do it no doubt there are

5432
01:32:02,870 --> 01:32:02,880
the only way to do it no doubt there are
 

5433
01:32:02,880 --> 01:32:04,850
the only way to do it no doubt there are
other architectures made made of

5434
01:32:04,850 --> 01:32:04,860
other architectures made made of
 

5435
01:32:04,860 --> 01:32:06,530
other architectures made made of
completely different principles that

5436
01:32:06,530 --> 01:32:06,540
completely different principles that
 

5437
01:32:06,540 --> 01:32:08,270
completely different principles that
achieve the same thing and once we

5438
01:32:08,270 --> 01:32:08,280
achieve the same thing and once we
 

5439
01:32:08,280 --> 01:32:11,090
achieve the same thing and once we
believe that then that tells us

5440
01:32:11,090 --> 01:32:11,100
believe that then that tells us
 

5441
01:32:11,100 --> 01:32:12,590
believe that then that tells us
something important it tells us that

5442
01:32:12,590 --> 01:32:12,600
something important it tells us that
 

5443
01:32:12,600 --> 01:32:15,530
something important it tells us that
things that are not quite human brains

5444
01:32:15,530 --> 01:32:15,540
things that are not quite human brains
 

5445
01:32:15,540 --> 01:32:17,450
things that are not quite human brains
or chimeras of human brains and other

tissue or human brains or other kinds of

5448
01:32:20,149 --> 01:32:20,159
tissue or human brains or other kinds of
 

5449
01:32:20,159 --> 01:32:22,129
tissue or human brains or other kinds of
brains and novel configurations or

5450
01:32:22,129 --> 01:32:22,139
brains and novel configurations or
 

5451
01:32:22,139 --> 01:32:23,689
brains and novel configurations or
things that are sort of brains but not

5452
01:32:23,689 --> 01:32:23,699
things that are sort of brains but not
 

5453
01:32:23,699 --> 01:32:26,110
things that are sort of brains but not
really or plants or embryos or whatever

5454
01:32:26,110 --> 01:32:26,120
really or plants or embryos or whatever
 

5455
01:32:26,120 --> 01:32:28,850
really or plants or embryos or whatever
might also have important cognitive

5456
01:32:28,850 --> 01:32:28,860
might also have important cognitive
 

5457
01:32:28,860 --> 01:32:31,610
might also have important cognitive
status so that's the only thing I think

5458
01:32:31,610 --> 01:32:31,620
status so that's the only thing I think
 

5459
01:32:31,620 --> 01:32:32,870
status so that's the only thing I think
we have to be really careful about

5460
01:32:32,870 --> 01:32:32,880
we have to be really careful about
 

5461
01:32:32,880 --> 01:32:34,850
we have to be really careful about
treating the human brain as if it was

5462
01:32:34,850 --> 01:32:34,860
treating the human brain as if it was
 

5463
01:32:34,860 --> 01:32:37,430
treating the human brain as if it was
some kind of like sharp binary category

5464
01:32:37,430 --> 01:32:37,440
some kind of like sharp binary category
 

5465
01:32:37,440 --> 01:32:39,709
some kind of like sharp binary category
you know you are or you aren't I I don't

5466
01:32:39,709 --> 01:32:39,719
you know you are or you aren't I I don't
 

5467
01:32:39,719 --> 01:32:42,470
you know you are or you aren't I I don't
believe that exists so when we look out

5468
01:32:42,470 --> 01:32:42,480
believe that exists so when we look out
 

5469
01:32:42,480 --> 01:32:45,970
believe that exists so when we look out
at all the beautiful variety of

5470
01:32:45,970 --> 01:32:45,980
at all the beautiful variety of
 

5471
01:32:45,980 --> 01:32:48,350
at all the beautiful variety of
semibological architectures out there in

5472
01:32:48,350 --> 01:32:48,360
semibological architectures out there in
 

5473
01:32:48,360 --> 01:32:51,010
semibological architectures out there in
the universe how many how many

5474
01:32:51,010 --> 01:32:51,020
the universe how many how many
 

5475
01:32:51,020 --> 01:32:53,570

intelligent alien civilizations do you

5476
01:32:53,570 --> 01:32:53,580
intelligent alien civilizations do you
 

5477
01:32:53,580 --> 01:32:56,810
intelligent alien civilizations do you
think are out there yeah boy I have you

5478
01:32:56,810 --> 01:32:56,820
think are out there yeah boy I have you
 

5479
01:32:56,820 --> 01:32:58,370
think are out there yeah boy I have you
know no expertise in that whatsoever

5480
01:32:58,370 --> 01:32:58,380
know no expertise in that whatsoever
 

5481
01:32:58,380 --> 01:33:01,790
know no expertise in that whatsoever
yeah you haven't met any I I have met

5482
01:33:01,790 --> 01:33:01,800
yeah you haven't met any I I have met
 

5483
01:33:01,800 --> 01:33:04,070
yeah you haven't met any I I have met
the ones we've made I think that I mean

5484
01:33:04,070 --> 01:33:04,080
the ones we've made I think that I mean
 

5485
01:33:04,080 --> 01:33:07,070
the ones we've made I think that I mean
exactly in some sense with synthetic

5486
01:33:07,070 --> 01:33:07,080
exactly in some sense with synthetic
 

5487
01:33:07,080 --> 01:33:10,430
exactly in some sense with synthetic
biology are you not creating aliens I

5488
01:33:10,430 --> 01:33:10,440
biology are you not creating aliens I
 

5489
01:33:10,440 --> 01:33:12,110
biology are you not creating aliens I
absolutely think so because because look

5490
01:33:12,110 --> 01:33:12,120
absolutely think so because because look
 

5491
01:33:12,120 --> 01:33:15,530
absolutely think so because because look
all of life all of St all standard model

01:33:15,540 --> 01:33:18,410
all of life all of St all standard model
systems are an N of one course of

evolution on earth right and trying to
 

5497
01:33:20,960 --> 01:33:24,110

make conclusions about biology from
 

5499
01:33:24,120 --> 01:33:26,750
make conclusions about biology from
looking at life on Earth is like testing

5500
01:33:26,750 --> 01:33:26,760
looking at life on Earth is like testing
 

5501
01:33:26,760 --> 01:33:28,430
looking at life on Earth is like testing
your theory on the same data that

5502
01:33:28,430 --> 01:33:28,440
your theory on the same data that
 

5503
01:33:28,440 --> 01:33:30,590
your theory on the same data that
generated it it's all it's all kind of

5504
01:33:30,590 --> 01:33:30,600
generated it it's all it's all kind of
 

5505
01:33:30,600 --> 01:33:33,709
generated it it's all it's all kind of
like locked in so we absolutely have to

5506
01:33:33,709 --> 01:33:33,719
like locked in so we absolutely have to
 

5507
01:33:33,719 --> 01:33:38,209
like locked in so we absolutely have to
create novel uh examples that have no

5508
01:33:38,209 --> 01:33:38,219
create novel uh examples that have no
 

5509
01:33:38,219 --> 01:33:40,189
create novel uh examples that have no
history on Earth that don't you know as

5510
01:33:40,189 --> 01:33:40,199
history on Earth that don't you know as
 

5511
01:33:40,199 --> 01:33:42,169
history on Earth that don't you know as
xenobots have no history of selection to

5512
01:33:42,169 --> 01:33:42,179
xenobots have no history of selection to
 

5513
01:33:42,179 --> 01:33:43,610
xenobots have no history of selection to
be a good xenobot the cells have

5514
01:33:43,610 --> 01:33:43,620
be a good xenobot the cells have
 

5515
01:33:43,620 --> 01:33:45,410
be a good xenobot the cells have
selection for various things but but the

5516
01:33:45,410 --> 01:33:45,420
selection for various things but but the
 

5517
01:33:45,420 --> 01:33:47,149
selection for various things but but the
xenobot itself never existed before and

5518
01:33:47,149 --> 01:33:47,159
xenobot itself never existed before and
 

5519
01:33:47,159 --> 01:33:48,790
xenobot itself never existed before and
so we can make chimeras you know we make

5520
01:33:48,790 --> 01:33:48,800
so we can make chimeras you know we make
 

5521
01:33:48,800 --> 01:33:50,689
so we can make chimeras you know we make
frogalodels that are you know sort of

5522
01:33:50,689 --> 01:33:50,699
frogalodels that are you know sort of
 

5523
01:33:50,699 --> 01:33:52,610
frogalodels that are you know sort of
half frog have Axolotl you can make all

5524
01:33:52,610 --> 01:33:52,620
half frog have Axolotl you can make all
 

5525
01:33:52,620 --> 01:33:54,290
half frog have Axolotl you can make all
sorts of high brats right constructions

5526
01:33:54,290 --> 01:33:54,300
sorts of high brats right constructions
 

5527
01:33:54,300 --> 01:33:56,030
sorts of high brats right constructions
of living to issue with robots and

5528
01:33:56,030 --> 01:33:56,040
of living to issue with robots and
 

5529
01:33:56,040 --> 01:33:58,189
of living to issue with robots and
whatever we need to be making these

5530
01:33:58,189 --> 01:33:58,199
whatever we need to be making these
 

5531
01:33:58,199 --> 01:33:59,990
whatever we need to be making these
things until we find actual aliens

5532
01:33:59,990 --> 01:34:00,000
things until we find actual aliens
 

5533
01:34:00,000 --> 01:34:02,330
things until we find actual aliens
because otherwise we're just looking at

5534
01:34:02,330 --> 01:34:02,340
because otherwise we're just looking at
 

5535
01:34:02,340 --> 01:34:04,310
because otherwise we're just looking at
an N of one set of examples all kinds of

5536
01:34:04,310 --> 01:34:04,320
an N of one set of examples all kinds of
 

5537
01:34:04,320 --> 01:34:06,229
an N of one set of examples all kinds of
Frozen accidents of evolution and so on

5538
01:34:06,229 --> 01:34:06,239
Frozen accidents of evolution and so on
 

5539
01:34:06,239 --> 01:34:08,390
Frozen accidents of evolution and so on
we need to go beyond that to really

5540
01:34:08,390 --> 01:34:08,400
we need to go beyond that to really
 

5541
01:34:08,400 --> 01:34:10,550
we need to go beyond that to really
understand biology but we're still even

5542
01:34:10,550 --> 01:34:10,560
understand biology but we're still even
 

5543
01:34:10,560 --> 01:34:12,229
understand biology but we're still even
if you when you do a synthetic biology

5544
01:34:12,229 --> 01:34:12,239
if you when you do a synthetic biology
 

5545
01:34:12,239 --> 01:34:16,189
if you when you do a synthetic biology
you're locked in to the basic components

5546
01:34:16,189 --> 01:34:16,199
you're locked in to the basic components
 

5547
01:34:16,199 --> 01:34:19,490
you're locked in to the basic components
of the way biology is done on this Earth

5548
01:34:19,490 --> 01:34:19,500
of the way biology is done on this Earth
 

5549
01:34:19,500 --> 01:34:21,430
of the way biology is done on this Earth
yeah right yeah yeah

5550
01:34:21,430 --> 01:34:21,440
yeah right yeah yeah
 

5551
01:34:21,440 --> 01:34:24,890
yeah right yeah yeah
and also the basic constraints to the

5552
01:34:24,890 --> 01:34:24,900
and also the basic constraints to the
 

5553
01:34:24,900 --> 01:34:26,990
and also the basic constraints to the
environment even artificial environments

5554
01:34:26,990 --> 01:34:27,000
environment even artificial environments
 

5555
01:34:27,000 --> 01:34:28,610
environment even artificial environments
to construct in the lab are tied up to

5556
01:34:28,610 --> 01:34:28,620
to construct in the lab are tied up to
 

5557
01:34:28,620 --> 01:34:32,209
to construct in the lab are tied up to
the environment I mean what do you okay

5558
01:34:32,209 --> 01:34:32,219
the environment I mean what do you okay
 

5559
01:34:32,219 --> 01:34:34,490
the environment I mean what do you okay
let's say there is I mean what I think

5560
01:34:34,490 --> 01:34:34,500
let's say there is I mean what I think
 

5561
01:34:34,500 --> 01:34:37,490
let's say there is I mean what I think
is there's

5562
01:34:37,490 --> 01:34:37,500

 

5563
01:34:37,500 --> 01:34:41,030

a nearly infinite number of intelligent

5564
01:34:41,030 --> 01:34:41,040
a nearly infinite number of intelligent
 

5565
01:34:41,040 --> 01:34:43,910
a nearly infinite number of intelligent
civilizations living or dead out there

5566
01:34:43,910 --> 01:34:43,920
civilizations living or dead out there
 

5567
01:34:43,920 --> 01:34:44,810
civilizations living or dead out there
um

5568
01:34:44,810 --> 01:34:44,820
um
 

5569
01:34:44,820 --> 01:34:47,149
um
if you pick one out of the box

5570
01:34:47,149 --> 01:34:47,159
if you pick one out of the box
 

5571
01:34:47,159 --> 01:34:50,510
if you pick one out of the box
what do you think it would look like

5572
01:34:50,510 --> 01:34:50,520
what do you think it would look like
 

5573
01:34:50,520 --> 01:34:52,129
what do you think it would look like
so

5574
01:34:52,129 --> 01:34:52,139
so
 

5575
01:34:52,139 --> 01:34:53,930
so
in in when you think about synthetic

5576
01:34:53,930 --> 01:34:53,940
in in when you think about synthetic
 

5577
01:34:53,940 --> 01:34:55,610
in in when you think about synthetic
biology

5578
01:34:55,610 --> 01:34:55,620
biology
 

5579
01:34:55,620 --> 01:34:59,209
biology
or creating synthetic organisms

5580
01:34:59,209 --> 01:34:59,219
or creating synthetic organisms
 

5581
01:34:59,219 --> 01:35:00,709
or creating synthetic organisms
how hard is it to create something

5582
01:35:00,709 --> 01:35:00,719
how hard is it to create something
 

5583
01:35:00,719 --> 01:35:03,290
how hard is it to create something
that's very different

5584
01:35:03,290 --> 01:35:03,300
that's very different
 

5585
01:35:03,300 --> 01:35:05,390
that's very different
yeah I think it's very hard to create

5586
01:35:05,390 --> 01:35:05,400
yeah I think it's very hard to create
 

5587
01:35:05,400 --> 01:35:06,950
yeah I think it's very hard to create
something that's very different right

5588
01:35:06,950 --> 01:35:06,960
something that's very different right
 

5589
01:35:06,960 --> 01:35:10,430
something that's very different right
it's um uh we are just locked in both

5590
01:35:10,430 --> 01:35:10,440
it's um uh we are just locked in both
 

5591
01:35:10,440 --> 01:35:13,850
it's um uh we are just locked in both
both uh experimentally and in terms of

5592
01:35:13,850 --> 01:35:13,860
both uh experimentally and in terms of
 

5593
01:35:13,860 --> 01:35:16,070
both uh experimentally and in terms of
our imagination right it's very hard and

5594
01:35:16,070 --> 01:35:16,080
our imagination right it's very hard and
 

5595
01:35:16,080 --> 01:35:17,689
our imagination right it's very hard and
you also emphasize several times that

5596
01:35:17,689 --> 01:35:17,699
you also emphasize several times that
 

5597
01:35:17,699 --> 01:35:20,390
you also emphasize several times that
the idea of shape yeah the individual

5598
01:35:20,390 --> 01:35:20,400
the idea of shape yeah the individual
 

5599
01:35:20,400 --> 01:35:22,729
the idea of shape yeah the individual
cell get together with other cells and

5600
01:35:22,729 --> 01:35:22,739
cell get together with other cells and
 

5601
01:35:22,739 --> 01:35:23,930
cell get together with other cells and
they kind of

5602
01:35:23,930 --> 01:35:23,940
they kind of
 

5603
01:35:23,940 --> 01:35:26,090
they kind of
they're gonna build a shape so it's

5604
01:35:26,090 --> 01:35:26,100
they're gonna build a shape so it's
 

5605
01:35:26,100 --> 01:35:27,890
they're gonna build a shape so it's
shape and function but shape is a

5606
01:35:27,890 --> 01:35:27,900
shape and function but shape is a
 

5607
01:35:27,900 --> 01:35:30,590
shape and function but shape is a
critical thing yeah so here I'll take a

5608
01:35:30,590 --> 01:35:30,600
critical thing yeah so here I'll take a
 

5609
01:35:30,600 --> 01:35:32,390
critical thing yeah so here I'll take a
stab I mean I I agree with you to

5610
01:35:32,390 --> 01:35:32,400
stab I mean I I agree with you to
 

5611
01:35:32,400 --> 01:35:34,310
stab I mean I I agree with you to
whatever extent though that we can say

5612
01:35:34,310 --> 01:35:34,320
whatever extent though that we can say
 

5613
01:35:34,320 --> 01:35:36,350
whatever extent though that we can say
anything I I do think that there's you

5614
01:35:36,350 --> 01:35:36,360
anything I I do think that there's you
 

5615
01:35:36,360 --> 01:35:37,910
anything I I do think that there's you
know probably an infinite number of of

5616
01:35:37,910 --> 01:35:37,920
know probably an infinite number of of
 

5617
01:35:37,920 --> 01:35:39,530
know probably an infinite number of of
different uh different

5618
01:35:39,530 --> 01:35:39,540
different uh different
 

5619
01:35:39,540 --> 01:35:41,330
different uh different
um uh architectures with with that are

5620
01:35:41,330 --> 01:35:41,340
um uh architectures with with that are
 

5621
01:35:41,340 --> 01:35:42,890
um uh architectures with with that are
with interesting cognitive properties

5622
01:35:42,890 --> 01:35:42,900
with interesting cognitive properties
 

5623
01:35:42,900 --> 01:35:45,410
with interesting cognitive properties
out there uh what can we say about them

5624
01:35:45,410 --> 01:35:45,420
out there uh what can we say about them
 

5625
01:35:45,420 --> 01:35:46,910
out there uh what can we say about them
I think that

5626
01:35:46,910 --> 01:35:46,920
I think that
 

5627
01:35:46,920 --> 01:35:49,550
I think that
um the only things that are going I I

5628
01:35:49,550 --> 01:35:49,560
um the only things that are going I I
 

5629
01:35:49,560 --> 01:35:51,350
um the only things that are going I I
don't think we can rely on any of the

5630
01:35:51,350 --> 01:35:51,360
don't think we can rely on any of the
 

5631
01:35:51,360 --> 01:35:53,510
don't think we can rely on any of the
typical stuff you know carbon based yeah

5632
01:35:53,510 --> 01:35:53,520
typical stuff you know carbon based yeah
 

5633
01:35:53,520 --> 01:35:56,090
typical stuff you know carbon based yeah
no no like I think all of that is just

5634
01:35:56,090 --> 01:35:56,100
no no like I think all of that is just
 

5635
01:35:56,100 --> 01:35:58,189
no no like I think all of that is just
um you know us being having having a

5636
01:35:58,189 --> 01:35:58,199
um you know us being having having a
 

5637
01:35:58,199 --> 01:36:00,950
um you know us being having having a
lack of imagination but I think the

5638
01:36:00,950 --> 01:36:00,960
lack of imagination but I think the
 

5639
01:36:00,960 --> 01:36:03,290
lack of imagination but I think the
things that um are going to be Universal

5640
01:36:03,290 --> 01:36:03,300
things that um are going to be Universal
 

5641
01:36:03,300 --> 01:36:06,169
things that um are going to be Universal
if anything is are things for example

5642
01:36:06,169 --> 01:36:06,179
if anything is are things for example
 

5643
01:36:06,179 --> 01:36:09,050
if anything is are things for example
driven by resource limitation the fact

5644
01:36:09,050 --> 01:36:09,060
driven by resource limitation the fact
 

5645
01:36:09,060 --> 01:36:11,209
driven by resource limitation the fact
that you are fighting a hostile world

5646
01:36:11,209 --> 01:36:11,219
that you are fighting a hostile world
 

5647
01:36:11,219 --> 01:36:13,250
that you are fighting a hostile world
and you have to draw a boundary between

5648
01:36:13,250 --> 01:36:13,260
and you have to draw a boundary between
 

5649
01:36:13,260 --> 01:36:14,750
and you have to draw a boundary between
yourself and the world somewhere the

5650
01:36:14,750 --> 01:36:14,760
yourself and the world somewhere the
 

5651
01:36:14,760 --> 01:36:16,129
yourself and the world somewhere the
fact that that boundary is not given to

5652
01:36:16,129 --> 01:36:16,139
fact that that boundary is not given to
 

5653
01:36:16,139 --> 01:36:17,750
fact that that boundary is not given to
you by anybody you have to you have to

5654
01:36:17,750 --> 01:36:17,760
you by anybody you have to you have to
 

5655
01:36:17,760 --> 01:36:19,790
you by anybody you have to you have to
assume it you know uh estimate it

5656
01:36:19,790 --> 01:36:19,800
assume it you know uh estimate it
 

5657
01:36:19,800 --> 01:36:21,830
assume it you know uh estimate it
yourself and the fact that you have to

5658
01:36:21,830 --> 01:36:21,840
yourself and the fact that you have to
 

5659
01:36:21,840 --> 01:36:23,570
yourself and the fact that you have to
coarse grain your experience and the

5660
01:36:23,570 --> 01:36:23,580
coarse grain your experience and the
 

5661
01:36:23,580 --> 01:36:24,649
coarse grain your experience and the
fact that you're going to try to

5662
01:36:24,649 --> 01:36:24,659
fact that you're going to try to
 

5663
01:36:24,659 --> 01:36:26,510
fact that you're going to try to
minimize surprise and the fact that like

5664
01:36:26,510 --> 01:36:26,520
minimize surprise and the fact that like
 

5665
01:36:26,520 --> 01:36:27,950
minimize surprise and the fact that like
these these are the things that I think

5666
01:36:27,950 --> 01:36:27,960
these these are the things that I think
 

5667
01:36:27,960 --> 01:36:29,750
these these are the things that I think
are fundamental about biology none of

5668
01:36:29,750 --> 01:36:29,760
are fundamental about biology none of
 

5669
01:36:29,760 --> 01:36:31,490
are fundamental about biology none of
the you know the facts about the genetic

5670
01:36:31,490 --> 01:36:31,500
the you know the facts about the genetic
 

5671
01:36:31,500 --> 01:36:33,110
the you know the facts about the genetic
code or even the fact that we have genes

5672
01:36:33,110 --> 01:36:33,120
code or even the fact that we have genes
 

5673
01:36:33,120 --> 01:36:34,490
code or even the fact that we have genes
or or the biochemistry of it I don't

5674
01:36:34,490 --> 01:36:34,500
or or the biochemistry of it I don't
 

5675
01:36:34,500 --> 01:36:35,270
or or the biochemistry of it I don't
think any of those things are

5676
01:36:35,270 --> 01:36:35,280
think any of those things are
 

5677
01:36:35,280 --> 01:36:37,550
think any of those things are
fundamental but um it's going to be a

5678
01:36:37,550 --> 01:36:37,560
fundamental but um it's going to be a
 

5679
01:36:37,560 --> 01:36:38,990
fundamental but um it's going to be a
lot more about the information and about

5680
01:36:38,990 --> 01:36:39,000
lot more about the information and about
 

5681
01:36:39,000 --> 01:36:40,729
lot more about the information and about
the creation of the self the fact that

5682
01:36:40,729 --> 01:36:40,739
the creation of the self the fact that
 

5683
01:36:40,739 --> 01:36:43,550
the creation of the self the fact that
so in my in my framework selves are

5684
01:36:43,550 --> 01:36:43,560
so in my in my framework selves are
 

5685
01:36:43,560 --> 01:36:46,310
so in my in my framework selves are
demarcated by uh the scale of the goals

5686
01:36:46,310 --> 01:36:46,320
demarcated by uh the scale of the goals
 

5687
01:36:46,320 --> 01:36:48,350
demarcated by uh the scale of the goals
that they can pursue so from little tiny

5688
01:36:48,350 --> 01:36:48,360
that they can pursue so from little tiny
 

5689
01:36:48,360 --> 01:36:49,970
that they can pursue so from little tiny
local goals to like massive you know

5690
01:36:49,970 --> 01:36:49,980
local goals to like massive you know
 

5691
01:36:49,980 --> 01:36:51,649
local goals to like massive you know
planetary scale goals for for certain

5692
01:36:51,649 --> 01:36:51,659
planetary scale goals for for certain
 

5693
01:36:51,659 --> 01:36:52,850
planetary scale goals for for certain
humans

5694
01:36:52,850 --> 01:36:52,860
humans
 

5695
01:36:52,860 --> 01:36:54,169
humans
um and everything and everything in

5696
01:36:54,169 --> 01:36:54,179
um and everything and everything in
 

5697
01:36:54,179 --> 01:36:55,250
um and everything and everything in
between so you can draw this like

5698
01:36:55,250 --> 01:36:55,260
between so you can draw this like
 

5699
01:36:55,260 --> 01:36:57,050
between so you can draw this like
cognitive light cone about that that

5700
01:36:57,050 --> 01:36:57,060
cognitive light cone about that that
 

5701
01:36:57,060 --> 01:36:59,510
cognitive light cone about that that
determines the the scale of the goals

5702
01:36:59,510 --> 01:36:59,520
determines the the scale of the goals
 

5703
01:36:59,520 --> 01:37:01,850
determines the the scale of the goals
you could possibly pursue I think those

5704
01:37:01,850 --> 01:37:01,860
you could possibly pursue I think those
 

5705
01:37:01,860 --> 01:37:04,610
you could possibly pursue I think those
kinds of Frameworks uh like that like

5706
01:37:04,610 --> 01:37:04,620
kinds of Frameworks uh like that like
 

5707
01:37:04,620 --> 01:37:06,110
kinds of Frameworks uh like that like
active inference and so on are going to

5708
01:37:06,110 --> 01:37:06,120
active inference and so on are going to
 

5709
01:37:06,120 --> 01:37:08,330
active inference and so on are going to
be universally applicable but but none

5710
01:37:08,330 --> 01:37:08,340
be universally applicable but but none
 

5711
01:37:08,340 --> 01:37:09,649
be universally applicable but but none
of the other things that are that are

5712
01:37:09,649 --> 01:37:09,659
of the other things that are that are
 

5713
01:37:09,659 --> 01:37:11,270
of the other things that are that are
typically um discussed

5714
01:37:11,270 --> 01:37:11,280
typically um discussed
 

5715
01:37:11,280 --> 01:37:13,790
typically um discussed
quick pause during the bathroom break

5716
01:37:13,790 --> 01:37:13,800
quick pause during the bathroom break
 

5717
01:37:13,800 --> 01:37:15,590
quick pause during the bathroom break
we were just talking about uh you know

5718
01:37:15,590 --> 01:37:15,600
we were just talking about uh you know
 

5719
01:37:15,600 --> 01:37:16,910
we were just talking about uh you know
aliens and all that that's a funny thing

5720
01:37:16,910 --> 01:37:16,920
aliens and all that that's a funny thing
 

5721
01:37:16,920 --> 01:37:18,350
aliens and all that that's a funny thing
which is yeah I don't know if you've

5722
01:37:18,350 --> 01:37:18,360
which is yeah I don't know if you've
 

5723
01:37:18,360 --> 01:37:20,149
which is yeah I don't know if you've
seen them there's a kind of debate that

5724
01:37:20,149 --> 01:37:20,159
seen them there's a kind of debate that
 

5725
01:37:20,159 --> 01:37:22,250
seen them there's a kind of debate that
goes on about cognition and plants and

5726
01:37:22,250 --> 01:37:22,260
goes on about cognition and plants and
 

5727
01:37:22,260 --> 01:37:23,450
goes on about cognition and plants and
what can you say about different kinds

5728
01:37:23,450 --> 01:37:23,460
what can you say about different kinds
 

5729
01:37:23,460 --> 01:37:24,950
what can you say about different kinds
of computation and cognition implants

5730
01:37:24,950 --> 01:37:24,960
of computation and cognition implants
 

5731
01:37:24,960 --> 01:37:26,390
of computation and cognition implants
and I always I always look at that

5732
01:37:26,390 --> 01:37:26,400
and I always I always look at that
 

5733
01:37:26,400 --> 01:37:28,250
and I always I always look at that
something like if if you're weirded out

5734
01:37:28,250 --> 01:37:28,260
something like if if you're weirded out
 

5735
01:37:28,260 --> 01:37:31,010
something like if if you're weirded out
by cognition in Plants you're not ready

5736
01:37:31,010 --> 01:37:31,020
by cognition in Plants you're not ready
 

5737
01:37:31,020 --> 01:37:33,290
by cognition in Plants you're not ready
for exobiology right if if you know

5738
01:37:33,290 --> 01:37:33,300
for exobiology right if if you know
 

5739
01:37:33,300 --> 01:37:35,090
for exobiology right if if you know
something that's that similar here on

5740
01:37:35,090 --> 01:37:35,100
something that's that similar here on
 

5741
01:37:35,100 --> 01:37:36,770
something that's that similar here on
Earth is already like freaking you out

5742
01:37:36,770 --> 01:37:36,780
Earth is already like freaking you out
 

5743
01:37:36,780 --> 01:37:38,750
Earth is already like freaking you out
then I think there's going to be all

5744
01:37:38,750 --> 01:37:38,760
then I think there's going to be all
 

5745
01:37:38,760 --> 01:37:40,250
then I think there's going to be all
kinds of cognitive life out there that

5746
01:37:40,250 --> 01:37:40,260
kinds of cognitive life out there that
 

5747
01:37:40,260 --> 01:37:41,390
kinds of cognitive life out there that
we're gonna have a really hard time

5748
01:37:41,390 --> 01:37:41,400
we're gonna have a really hard time
 

5749
01:37:41,400 --> 01:37:42,830
we're gonna have a really hard time
recognizing

5750
01:37:42,830 --> 01:37:42,840
recognizing
 

5751
01:37:42,840 --> 01:37:46,310
recognizing
I think robots will help us yeah

5752
01:37:46,310 --> 01:37:46,320
I think robots will help us yeah
 

5753
01:37:46,320 --> 01:37:49,250
I think robots will help us yeah
like expand our mind about cognition

5754
01:37:49,250 --> 01:37:49,260
like expand our mind about cognition
 

5755
01:37:49,260 --> 01:37:54,410
like expand our mind about cognition
either that or the word like xenobots so

5756
01:37:54,410 --> 01:37:54,420
either that or the word like xenobots so
 

5757
01:37:54,420 --> 01:37:57,709
either that or the word like xenobots so
and they maybe becomes the same thing it

5758
01:37:57,709 --> 01:37:57,719
and they maybe becomes the same thing it
 

5759
01:37:57,719 --> 01:38:00,890
and they maybe becomes the same thing it
is you know really when the human

5760
01:38:00,890 --> 01:38:00,900
is you know really when the human
 

5761
01:38:00,900 --> 01:38:05,030
is you know really when the human
Engineers the thing at least in part and

5762
01:38:05,030 --> 01:38:05,040
Engineers the thing at least in part and
 

5763
01:38:05,040 --> 01:38:06,950
Engineers the thing at least in part and
then is able to achieve some kind of

5764
01:38:06,950 --> 01:38:06,960
then is able to achieve some kind of
 

5765
01:38:06,960 --> 01:38:08,990
then is able to achieve some kind of
cognition that's different than what

5766
01:38:08,990 --> 01:38:09,000
cognition that's different than what
 

5767
01:38:09,000 --> 01:38:10,729
cognition that's different than what
you're used to then you start to

5768
01:38:10,729 --> 01:38:10,739
you're used to then you start to
 

5769
01:38:10,739 --> 01:38:12,530
you're used to then you start to
understand like oh

5770
01:38:12,530 --> 01:38:12,540
understand like oh
 

5771
01:38:12,540 --> 01:38:15,229
understand like oh
cut you know every living organism is

5772
01:38:15,229 --> 01:38:15,239
cut you know every living organism is
 

5773
01:38:15,239 --> 01:38:17,270
cut you know every living organism is
capable of cognition oh I need to kind

5774
01:38:17,270 --> 01:38:17,280
capable of cognition oh I need to kind
 

5775
01:38:17,280 --> 01:38:19,370
capable of cognition oh I need to kind
of broaden my understanding what

5776
01:38:19,370 --> 01:38:19,380
of broaden my understanding what
 

5777
01:38:19,380 --> 01:38:21,830
of broaden my understanding what
cognition is but do you think plants um

5778
01:38:21,830 --> 01:38:21,840
cognition is but do you think plants um
 

5779
01:38:21,840 --> 01:38:24,410
cognition is but do you think plants um
like when you when you eat them are they

5780
01:38:24,410 --> 01:38:24,420
like when you when you eat them are they
 

5781
01:38:24,420 --> 01:38:26,570
like when you when you eat them are they
screaming I don't know about screaming I

5782
01:38:26,570 --> 01:38:26,580
screaming I don't know about screaming I
 

5783
01:38:26,580 --> 01:38:27,890
screaming I don't know about screaming I
think you have to see what I think when

5784
01:38:27,890 --> 01:38:27,900
think you have to see what I think when
 

5785
01:38:27,900 --> 01:38:30,770
think you have to see what I think when
I eat a salad yeah good yeah I think you

5786
01:38:30,770 --> 01:38:30,780
I eat a salad yeah good yeah I think you
 

5787
01:38:30,780 --> 01:38:33,110
I eat a salad yeah good yeah I think you
have to scale down the expectations in

5788
01:38:33,110 --> 01:38:33,120
have to scale down the expectations in
 

5789
01:38:33,120 --> 01:38:34,669
have to scale down the expectations in
terms of right so so probably they're

5790
01:38:34,669 --> 01:38:34,679
terms of right so so probably they're
 

5791
01:38:34,679 --> 01:38:35,870
terms of right so so probably they're
not screaming in the way that we would

5792
01:38:35,870 --> 01:38:35,880
not screaming in the way that we would
 

5793
01:38:35,880 --> 01:38:38,149
not screaming in the way that we would
be screaming however there's plenty of

5794
01:38:38,149 --> 01:38:38,159
be screaming however there's plenty of
 

5795
01:38:38,159 --> 01:38:41,330
be screaming however there's plenty of
data on Plants being able to um to do

5796
01:38:41,330 --> 01:38:41,340
data on Plants being able to um to do
 

5797
01:38:41,340 --> 01:38:43,310
data on Plants being able to um to do
anticipation and certain kinds of memory

5798
01:38:43,310 --> 01:38:43,320
anticipation and certain kinds of memory
 

5799
01:38:43,320 --> 01:38:45,350
anticipation and certain kinds of memory
and and so on

5800
01:38:45,350 --> 01:38:45,360
and and so on
 

5801
01:38:45,360 --> 01:38:47,270
and and so on
um I think you know what you just said

5802
01:38:47,270 --> 01:38:47,280
um I think you know what you just said
 

5803
01:38:47,280 --> 01:38:49,370
um I think you know what you just said
about robots uh I I hope you're right

5804
01:38:49,370 --> 01:38:49,380
about robots uh I I hope you're right
 

5805
01:38:49,380 --> 01:38:50,990
about robots uh I I hope you're right
and I hope that's but but there's two

5806
01:38:50,990 --> 01:38:51,000
and I hope that's but but there's two
 

5807
01:38:51,000 --> 01:38:52,310
and I hope that's but but there's two
there's two ways that people can take

5808
01:38:52,310 --> 01:38:52,320
there's two ways that people can take
 

5809
01:38:52,320 --> 01:38:53,870
there's two ways that people can take
that right so one way is exactly what

5810
01:38:53,870 --> 01:38:53,880
that right so one way is exactly what
 

5811
01:38:53,880 --> 01:38:55,310
that right so one way is exactly what
you just said to try to kind of expand

5812
01:38:55,310 --> 01:38:55,320
you just said to try to kind of expand
 

5813
01:38:55,320 --> 01:38:57,470
you just said to try to kind of expand
their expand their their their Notions

5814
01:38:57,470 --> 01:38:57,480
their expand their their their Notions
 

5815
01:38:57,480 --> 01:38:59,629
their expand their their their Notions
for that category the other way people

5816
01:38:59,629 --> 01:38:59,639
for that category the other way people
 

5817
01:38:59,639 --> 01:39:03,410
for that category the other way people
often go is uh they just sort of Define

5818
01:39:03,410 --> 01:39:03,420
often go is uh they just sort of Define
 

5819
01:39:03,420 --> 01:39:06,530
often go is uh they just sort of Define
the term as if if it's not a natural

5820
01:39:06,530 --> 01:39:06,540
the term as if if it's not a natural
 

5821
01:39:06,540 --> 01:39:08,930
the term as if if it's not a natural
product it's it's just faking right it's

5822
01:39:08,930 --> 01:39:08,940
product it's it's just faking right it's
 

5823
01:39:08,940 --> 01:39:10,430
product it's it's just faking right it's
not really intelligence if it was made

5824
01:39:10,430 --> 01:39:10,440
not really intelligence if it was made
 

5825
01:39:10,440 --> 01:39:12,110
not really intelligence if it was made
by somebody else because it's that same

5826
01:39:12,110 --> 01:39:12,120
by somebody else because it's that same
 

5827
01:39:12,120 --> 01:39:13,490
by somebody else because it's that same
it's the same thing they can see how

5828
01:39:13,490 --> 01:39:13,500
it's the same thing they can see how
 

5829
01:39:13,500 --> 01:39:15,830
it's the same thing they can see how
it's done and once you see how it's like

5830
01:39:15,830 --> 01:39:15,840
it's done and once you see how it's like
 

5831
01:39:15,840 --> 01:39:17,390
it's done and once you see how it's like
a magic trick when you see how it's done

5832
01:39:17,390 --> 01:39:17,400
a magic trick when you see how it's done
 

5833
01:39:17,400 --> 01:39:20,990
a magic trick when you see how it's done
it's not as fun anymore and and I think

5834
01:39:20,990 --> 01:39:21,000
it's not as fun anymore and and I think
 

5835
01:39:21,000 --> 01:39:22,430
it's not as fun anymore and and I think
people have a real tendency for that and

5836
01:39:22,430 --> 01:39:22,440
people have a real tendency for that and
 

5837
01:39:22,440 --> 01:39:23,930
people have a real tendency for that and
they sort of which which I find really

5838
01:39:23,930 --> 01:39:23,940
they sort of which which I find really
 

5839
01:39:23,940 --> 01:39:25,610
they sort of which which I find really
strange in the sense that if somebody he

5840
01:39:25,610 --> 01:39:25,620
strange in the sense that if somebody he
 

5841
01:39:25,620 --> 01:39:26,870
strange in the sense that if somebody he
said to me

5842
01:39:26,870 --> 01:39:26,880
said to me
 

5843
01:39:26,880 --> 01:39:30,110
said to me
we have this this sort of blind like

5844
01:39:30,110 --> 01:39:30,120
we have this this sort of blind like
 

5845
01:39:30,120 --> 01:39:32,990
we have this this sort of blind like
like uh hill climbing search and then

5846
01:39:32,990 --> 01:39:33,000
like uh hill climbing search and then
 

5847
01:39:33,000 --> 01:39:34,850
like uh hill climbing search and then
and then we have a really smart team of

5848
01:39:34,850 --> 01:39:34,860
and then we have a really smart team of
 

5849
01:39:34,860 --> 01:39:36,770
and then we have a really smart team of
Engineers which one do you think is

5850
01:39:36,770 --> 01:39:36,780
Engineers which one do you think is
 

5851
01:39:36,780 --> 01:39:39,050
Engineers which one do you think is
going to produce a system that has good

5852
01:39:39,050 --> 01:39:39,060
going to produce a system that has good
 

5853
01:39:39,060 --> 01:39:40,850
going to produce a system that has good
intelligence I think it's really weird

5854
01:39:40,850 --> 01:39:40,860
intelligence I think it's really weird
 

5855
01:39:40,860 --> 01:39:42,709
intelligence I think it's really weird
to say that it only comes from the blind

5856
01:39:42,709 --> 01:39:42,719
to say that it only comes from the blind
 

5857
01:39:42,719 --> 01:39:44,689
to say that it only comes from the blind
search right it can't be done by people

5858
01:39:44,689 --> 01:39:44,699
search right it can't be done by people
 

5859
01:39:44,699 --> 01:39:46,370
search right it can't be done by people
who by the way can also use evolutionary

5860
01:39:46,370 --> 01:39:46,380
who by the way can also use evolutionary
 

5861
01:39:46,380 --> 01:39:47,750
who by the way can also use evolutionary
techniques if they want to but also

5862
01:39:47,750 --> 01:39:47,760
techniques if they want to but also
 

5863
01:39:47,760 --> 01:39:49,490
techniques if they want to but also
rational design I think it's really

5864
01:39:49,490 --> 01:39:49,500
rational design I think it's really
 

5865
01:39:49,500 --> 01:39:51,110
rational design I think it's really
weird to say that

5866
01:39:51,110 --> 01:39:51,120
weird to say that
 

5867
01:39:51,120 --> 01:39:52,970
weird to say that
um real intelligence only comes from

5868
01:39:52,970 --> 01:39:52,980
um real intelligence only comes from
 

5869
01:39:52,980 --> 01:39:54,410
um real intelligence only comes from
Natural Evolution

5870
01:39:54,410 --> 01:39:54,420
Natural Evolution
 

5871
01:39:54,420 --> 01:39:55,850
Natural Evolution
so I hope you're right I hope people

5872
01:39:55,850 --> 01:39:55,860
so I hope you're right I hope people
 

5873
01:39:55,860 --> 01:39:57,410
so I hope you're right I hope people
take it the other the other way but

5874
01:39:57,410 --> 01:39:57,420
take it the other the other way but
 

5875
01:39:57,420 --> 01:40:00,050
take it the other the other way but
there's a nice shortcut so I work with

5876
01:40:00,050 --> 01:40:00,060
there's a nice shortcut so I work with
 

5877
01:40:00,060 --> 01:40:04,010
there's a nice shortcut so I work with
Lego robots a lot now from for my own uh

5878
01:40:04,010 --> 01:40:04,020
Lego robots a lot now from for my own uh
 

5879
01:40:04,020 --> 01:40:06,950
Lego robots a lot now from for my own uh
personal pleasure not in that way

5880
01:40:06,950 --> 01:40:06,960
personal pleasure not in that way
 

5881
01:40:06,960 --> 01:40:11,810
personal pleasure not in that way
internet uh so the four legs

5882
01:40:11,810 --> 01:40:11,820
internet uh so the four legs
 

5883
01:40:11,820 --> 01:40:14,689
internet uh so the four legs
and uh one of the things that

5884
01:40:14,689 --> 01:40:14,699
and uh one of the things that
 

5885
01:40:14,699 --> 01:40:17,209
and uh one of the things that
changes my experience with the robots a

5886
01:40:17,209 --> 01:40:17,219
changes my experience with the robots a
 

5887
01:40:17,219 --> 01:40:19,070
changes my experience with the robots a
lot is um

5888
01:40:19,070 --> 01:40:19,080
lot is um
 

5889
01:40:19,080 --> 01:40:21,530
lot is um
when I can't understand why I did a

5890
01:40:21,530 --> 01:40:21,540
when I can't understand why I did a
 

5891
01:40:21,540 --> 01:40:22,729
when I can't understand why I did a
certain thing and there's a lot of ways

5892
01:40:22,729 --> 01:40:22,739
certain thing and there's a lot of ways
 

5893
01:40:22,739 --> 01:40:24,350
certain thing and there's a lot of ways
to engineer that

5894
01:40:24,350 --> 01:40:24,360
to engineer that
 

5895
01:40:24,360 --> 01:40:26,689
to engineer that
meet the person that created the

5896
01:40:26,689 --> 01:40:26,699
meet the person that created the
 

5897
01:40:26,699 --> 01:40:28,790
meet the person that created the
software that runs it

5898
01:40:28,790 --> 01:40:28,800
software that runs it
 

5899
01:40:28,800 --> 01:40:30,590
software that runs it
there's a lot of ways for me to build

5900
01:40:30,590 --> 01:40:30,600
there's a lot of ways for me to build
 

5901
01:40:30,600 --> 01:40:32,330
there's a lot of ways for me to build
that software in such a way that I don't

5902
01:40:32,330 --> 01:40:32,340
that software in such a way that I don't
 

5903
01:40:32,340 --> 01:40:35,750
that software in such a way that I don't
exactly know why it did a certain basic

5904
01:40:35,750 --> 01:40:35,760
exactly know why it did a certain basic
 

5905
01:40:35,760 --> 01:40:36,709
exactly know why it did a certain basic
decision

5906
01:40:36,709 --> 01:40:36,719
decision
 

5907
01:40:36,719 --> 01:40:38,870
decision
of course as an engineer you can go in

5908
01:40:38,870 --> 01:40:38,880
of course as an engineer you can go in
 

5909
01:40:38,880 --> 01:40:41,270
of course as an engineer you can go in
and start to look at logs you can log

5910
01:40:41,270 --> 01:40:41,280
and start to look at logs you can log
 

5911
01:40:41,280 --> 01:40:43,910
and start to look at logs you can log
all kind of data sensory data the the

5912
01:40:43,910 --> 01:40:43,920
all kind of data sensory data the the
 

5913
01:40:43,920 --> 01:40:45,770
all kind of data sensory data the the
decisions you made you know all the

5914
01:40:45,770 --> 01:40:45,780
decisions you made you know all the
 

5915
01:40:45,780 --> 01:40:47,149
decisions you made you know all the
outputs and neural networks and so on

5916
01:40:47,149 --> 01:40:47,159
outputs and neural networks and so on
 

5917
01:40:47,159 --> 01:40:50,450
outputs and neural networks and so on
but I also try to really experience that

5918
01:40:50,450 --> 01:40:50,460
but I also try to really experience that
 

5919
01:40:50,460 --> 01:40:53,570
but I also try to really experience that
surprise and that really experience as

5920
01:40:53,570 --> 01:40:53,580
surprise and that really experience as
 

5921
01:40:53,580 --> 01:40:55,070
surprise and that really experience as
another person would that totally

5922
01:40:55,070 --> 01:40:55,080
another person would that totally
 

5923
01:40:55,080 --> 01:40:57,410
another person would that totally
doesn't know how it's built and I think

5924
01:40:57,410 --> 01:40:57,420
doesn't know how it's built and I think
 

5925
01:40:57,420 --> 01:40:59,750
doesn't know how it's built and I think
the magic is there and not knowing how

5926
01:40:59,750 --> 01:40:59,760
the magic is there and not knowing how
 

5927
01:40:59,760 --> 01:41:01,610
the magic is there and not knowing how
it works

5928
01:41:01,610 --> 01:41:01,620
it works
 

5929
01:41:01,620 --> 01:41:05,930
it works
that I think biology does that for you

5930
01:41:05,930 --> 01:41:05,940
that I think biology does that for you
 

5931
01:41:05,940 --> 01:41:08,930
that I think biology does that for you
through the layers of abstraction yeah

5932
01:41:08,930 --> 01:41:08,940
through the layers of abstraction yeah
 

5933
01:41:08,940 --> 01:41:11,510
through the layers of abstraction yeah
it because nobody really knows what's

5934
01:41:11,510 --> 01:41:11,520
it because nobody really knows what's
 

5935
01:41:11,520 --> 01:41:14,629
it because nobody really knows what's
going on inside the biological like each

5936
01:41:14,629 --> 01:41:14,639
going on inside the biological like each
 

5937
01:41:14,639 --> 01:41:17,390
going on inside the biological like each
one component is clueless about the big

5938
01:41:17,390 --> 01:41:17,400
one component is clueless about the big
 

5939
01:41:17,400 --> 01:41:19,790
one component is clueless about the big
picture I think there's actually really

5940
01:41:19,790 --> 01:41:19,800
picture I think there's actually really
 

5941
01:41:19,800 --> 01:41:21,649
picture I think there's actually really
cheap systems that can that can

5942
01:41:21,649 --> 01:41:21,659
cheap systems that can that can
 

5943
01:41:21,659 --> 01:41:23,090
cheap systems that can that can
illustrate that kind of thing which is

5944
01:41:23,090 --> 01:41:23,100
illustrate that kind of thing which is
 

5945
01:41:23,100 --> 01:41:26,330
illustrate that kind of thing which is
even like um you know uh fractals right

5946
01:41:26,330 --> 01:41:26,340
even like um you know uh fractals right
 

5947
01:41:26,340 --> 01:41:29,810
even like um you know uh fractals right
like you have a very small short formula

5948
01:41:29,810 --> 01:41:29,820
like you have a very small short formula
 

5949
01:41:29,820 --> 01:41:32,209
like you have a very small short formula
in Z and you see it and there's no magic

5950
01:41:32,209 --> 01:41:32,219
in Z and you see it and there's no magic
 

5951
01:41:32,219 --> 01:41:33,649
in Z and you see it and there's no magic
you're just going to crank through you

5952
01:41:33,649 --> 01:41:33,659
you're just going to crank through you
 

5953
01:41:33,659 --> 01:41:35,209
you're just going to crank through you
know Z squared plus C whatever you're

5954
01:41:35,209 --> 01:41:35,219
know Z squared plus C whatever you're
 

5955
01:41:35,219 --> 01:41:37,189
know Z squared plus C whatever you're
just going to crank through it but the

5956
01:41:37,189 --> 01:41:37,199
just going to crank through it but the
 

5957
01:41:37,199 --> 01:41:39,470
just going to crank through it but the
result of it is this incredibly Rich

5958
01:41:39,470 --> 01:41:39,480
result of it is this incredibly Rich
 

5959
01:41:39,480 --> 01:41:42,410
result of it is this incredibly Rich
beautiful image right that that just

5960
01:41:42,410 --> 01:41:42,420
beautiful image right that that just
 

5961
01:41:42,420 --> 01:41:45,169
beautiful image right that that just
like wow all of that was in this like 10

5962
01:41:45,169 --> 01:41:45,179
like wow all of that was in this like 10
 

5963
01:41:45,179 --> 01:41:47,990
like wow all of that was in this like 10
character long string like amazing so

5964
01:41:47,990 --> 01:41:48,000
character long string like amazing so
 

5965
01:41:48,000 --> 01:41:50,209
character long string like amazing so
the fact that you can you can know

5966
01:41:50,209 --> 01:41:50,219
the fact that you can you can know
 

5967
01:41:50,219 --> 01:41:52,609
the fact that you can you can know
everything there is to know about the

5968
01:41:52,609 --> 01:41:52,619
everything there is to know about the
 

5969
01:41:52,619 --> 01:41:54,410
everything there is to know about the
details and the process and all the

5970
01:41:54,410 --> 01:41:54,420
details and the process and all the
 

5971
01:41:54,420 --> 01:41:55,370
details and the process and all the
parts and everything like there's

5972
01:41:55,370 --> 01:41:55,380
parts and everything like there's
 

5973
01:41:55,380 --> 01:41:57,890
parts and everything like there's
literally no magic of any kind there and

5974
01:41:57,890 --> 01:41:57,900
literally no magic of any kind there and
 

5975
01:41:57,900 --> 01:42:01,010
literally no magic of any kind there and
yet the outcome is something that you

5976
01:42:01,010 --> 01:42:01,020
yet the outcome is something that you
 

5977
01:42:01,020 --> 01:42:02,990
yet the outcome is something that you
would never have expected and it's just

5978
01:42:02,990 --> 01:42:03,000
would never have expected and it's just
 

5979
01:42:03,000 --> 01:42:05,270
would never have expected and it's just
it just you know is incredibly rich and

5980
01:42:05,270 --> 01:42:05,280
it just you know is incredibly rich and
 

5981
01:42:05,280 --> 01:42:08,030
it just you know is incredibly rich and
complex and beautiful so there's a lot

5982
01:42:08,030 --> 01:42:08,040
complex and beautiful so there's a lot
 

5983
01:42:08,040 --> 01:42:10,790
complex and beautiful so there's a lot
of that you write that you work on

5984
01:42:10,790 --> 01:42:10,800
of that you write that you work on
 

5985
01:42:10,800 --> 01:42:12,890
of that you write that you work on
developing conceptual Frameworks for

5986
01:42:12,890 --> 01:42:12,900
developing conceptual Frameworks for
 

5987
01:42:12,900 --> 01:42:14,810
developing conceptual Frameworks for
understanding unconventional cognition

5988
01:42:14,810 --> 01:42:14,820
understanding unconventional cognition
 

5989
01:42:14,820 --> 01:42:16,310
understanding unconventional cognition
so the kind of thing we've been talking

5990
01:42:16,310 --> 01:42:16,320
so the kind of thing we've been talking
 

5991
01:42:16,320 --> 01:42:17,890
so the kind of thing we've been talking
about I just like the term

5992
01:42:17,890 --> 01:42:17,900
about I just like the term
 

5993
01:42:17,900 --> 01:42:20,450
about I just like the term
unconventional cognition

5994
01:42:20,450 --> 01:42:20,460
unconventional cognition
 

5995
01:42:20,460 --> 01:42:22,490
unconventional cognition
and you want to figure out how to detect

5996
01:42:22,490 --> 01:42:22,500
and you want to figure out how to detect
 

5997
01:42:22,500 --> 01:42:23,990
and you want to figure out how to detect
study and communicate with a thing

5998
01:42:23,990 --> 01:42:24,000
study and communicate with a thing
 

5999
01:42:24,000 --> 01:42:26,030
study and communicate with a thing
you've already mentioned a few examples

6000
01:42:26,030 --> 01:42:26,040
you've already mentioned a few examples
 

6001
01:42:26,040 --> 01:42:29,209
you've already mentioned a few examples
but what is unconventional cognition is

6002
01:42:29,209 --> 01:42:29,219
but what is unconventional cognition is
 

6003
01:42:29,219 --> 01:42:32,090
but what is unconventional cognition is
it as simply as everything outside of

6004
01:42:32,090 --> 01:42:32,100
it as simply as everything outside of
 

6005
01:42:32,100 --> 01:42:33,709
it as simply as everything outside of
what we Define usually as cognition

6006
01:42:33,709 --> 01:42:33,719
what we Define usually as cognition
 

6007
01:42:33,719 --> 01:42:35,870
what we Define usually as cognition
cognitive science the stuff going on

6008
01:42:35,870 --> 01:42:35,880
cognitive science the stuff going on
 

6009
01:42:35,880 --> 01:42:38,450
cognitive science the stuff going on
between our ears or is there some deeper

6010
01:42:38,450 --> 01:42:38,460
between our ears or is there some deeper
 

6011
01:42:38,460 --> 01:42:41,450
between our ears or is there some deeper
way to get at the fundamentals of

6012
01:42:41,450 --> 01:42:41,460
way to get at the fundamentals of
 

6013
01:42:41,460 --> 01:42:43,550
way to get at the fundamentals of
what is cognition

6014
01:42:43,550 --> 01:42:43,560
what is cognition
 

6015
01:42:43,560 --> 01:42:46,370
what is cognition
yeah I think like uh and and if I'm

6016
01:42:46,370 --> 01:42:46,380
yeah I think like uh and and if I'm
 

6017
01:42:46,380 --> 01:42:47,570
yeah I think like uh and and if I'm
certainly not the only person who works

6018
01:42:47,570 --> 01:42:47,580
certainly not the only person who works
 

6019
01:42:47,580 --> 01:42:49,729
certainly not the only person who works
in unconvention unconventional um

6020
01:42:49,729 --> 01:42:49,739
in unconvention unconventional um
 

6021
01:42:49,739 --> 01:42:52,490
in unconvention unconventional um
cognition so it's the term used yeah

6022
01:42:52,490 --> 01:42:52,500
cognition so it's the term used yeah
 

6023
01:42:52,500 --> 01:42:54,169
cognition so it's the term used yeah
that's one that so I've coined a number

6024
01:42:54,169 --> 01:42:54,179
that's one that so I've coined a number
 

6025
01:42:54,179 --> 01:42:55,370
that's one that so I've coined a number
of weird terms but that's not one of

6026
01:42:55,370 --> 01:42:55,380
of weird terms but that's not one of
 

6027
01:42:55,380 --> 01:42:56,750
of weird terms but that's not one of
mine like that that's an existing thing

6028
01:42:56,750 --> 01:42:56,760
mine like that that's an existing thing
 

6029
01:42:56,760 --> 01:42:58,490
mine like that that's an existing thing
so so for example somebody like Andy

6030
01:42:58,490 --> 01:42:58,500
so so for example somebody like Andy
 

6031
01:42:58,500 --> 01:43:00,229
so so for example somebody like Andy
adamasky who um I don't know if you've

6032
01:43:00,229 --> 01:43:00,239
adamasky who um I don't know if you've
 

6033
01:43:00,239 --> 01:43:01,729
adamasky who um I don't know if you've
if you've had him on if you haven't you

6034
01:43:01,729 --> 01:43:01,739
if you've had him on if you haven't you
 

6035
01:43:01,739 --> 01:43:04,010
if you've had him on if you haven't you
you should he's a he's a he's a you know

6036
01:43:04,010 --> 01:43:04,020
you should he's a he's a he's a you know
 

6037
01:43:04,020 --> 01:43:05,689
you should he's a he's a he's a you know
very interesting guy he's a computer

6038
01:43:05,689 --> 01:43:05,699
very interesting guy he's a computer
 

6039
01:43:05,699 --> 01:43:07,070
very interesting guy he's a computer
scientist and he does unconventional

6040
01:43:07,070 --> 01:43:07,080
scientist and he does unconventional
 

6041
01:43:07,080 --> 01:43:09,470
scientist and he does unconventional
cognition and Sly molds and all kinds of

6042
01:43:09,470 --> 01:43:09,480
cognition and Sly molds and all kinds of
 

6043
01:43:09,480 --> 01:43:11,689
cognition and Sly molds and all kinds of
weird um he's a real weird weird cat

6044
01:43:11,689 --> 01:43:11,699
weird um he's a real weird weird cat
 

6045
01:43:11,699 --> 01:43:13,850
weird um he's a real weird weird cat
really interesting anyway so so that's

6046
01:43:13,850 --> 01:43:13,860
really interesting anyway so so that's
 

6047
01:43:13,860 --> 01:43:15,410
really interesting anyway so so that's
on you know there's a bunch of terms

6048
01:43:15,410 --> 01:43:15,420
on you know there's a bunch of terms
 

6049
01:43:15,420 --> 01:43:16,430
on you know there's a bunch of terms
that I've come up with but that's not

6050
01:43:16,430 --> 01:43:16,440
that I've come up with but that's not
 

6051
01:43:16,440 --> 01:43:19,129
that I've come up with but that's not
one of mine so I think like many terms

6052
01:43:19,129 --> 01:43:19,139
one of mine so I think like many terms
 

6053
01:43:19,139 --> 01:43:22,669
one of mine so I think like many terms
that one is is really defined by the

6054
01:43:22,669 --> 01:43:22,679
that one is is really defined by the
 

6055
01:43:22,679 --> 01:43:24,530
that one is is really defined by the
times meaning that unconventional

6056
01:43:24,530 --> 01:43:24,540
times meaning that unconventional
 

6057
01:43:24,540 --> 01:43:25,729
times meaning that unconventional
cognitive thing things that are

6058
01:43:25,729 --> 01:43:25,739
cognitive thing things that are
 

6059
01:43:25,739 --> 01:43:27,590
cognitive thing things that are
unconventional cognition today are not

6060
01:43:27,590 --> 01:43:27,600
unconventional cognition today are not
 

6061
01:43:27,600 --> 01:43:29,209
unconventional cognition today are not
going to be considered unconventional

6062
01:43:29,209 --> 01:43:29,219
going to be considered unconventional
 

6063
01:43:29,219 --> 01:43:31,970
going to be considered unconventional
cognition at some point uh it's one of

6064
01:43:31,970 --> 01:43:31,980
cognition at some point uh it's one of
 

6065
01:43:31,980 --> 01:43:34,790
cognition at some point uh it's one of
those it's one of those things and so

6066
01:43:34,790 --> 01:43:34,800
those it's one of those things and so
 

6067
01:43:34,800 --> 01:43:37,189
those it's one of those things and so
it's you know it's it's it's this it's

6068
01:43:37,189 --> 01:43:37,199
it's you know it's it's it's this it's
 

6069
01:43:37,199 --> 01:43:39,590
it's you know it's it's it's this it's
this really deep question of how do you

6070
01:43:39,590 --> 01:43:39,600
this really deep question of how do you
 

6071
01:43:39,600 --> 01:43:42,709
this really deep question of how do you
recognize communicate with

um you know again if you stick with the
 

6081
01:43:51,300 --> 01:43:53,330
um you know again if you stick with the
with the uh the history of life on earth

6082
01:43:53,330 --> 01:43:53,340
with the uh the history of life on earth
 

6083
01:43:53,340 --> 01:43:55,550
with the uh the history of life on earth
like these these exact model systems you

6084
01:43:55,550 --> 01:43:55,560
like these these exact model systems you
 

6085
01:43:55,560 --> 01:43:56,750
like these these exact model systems you
would say ah here's a particular

6086
01:43:56,750 --> 01:43:56,760
would say ah here's a particular
 

6087
01:43:56,760 --> 01:43:58,250
would say ah here's a particular
structure of the brain and this one has

6088
01:43:58,250 --> 01:43:58,260
structure of the brain and this one has
 

6089
01:43:58,260 --> 01:43:59,689
structure of the brain and this one has
fewer of those and this one has a bigger

6090
01:43:59,689 --> 01:43:59,699
fewer of those and this one has a bigger
 

6091
01:43:59,699 --> 01:44:01,790
fewer of those and this one has a bigger
frontal cortex and this one right so

6092
01:44:01,790 --> 01:44:01,800
frontal cortex and this one right so
 

6093
01:44:01,800 --> 01:44:03,350
frontal cortex and this one right so
these are these are landmarks that that

6094
01:44:03,350 --> 01:44:03,360
these are these are landmarks that that
 

6095
01:44:03,360 --> 01:44:05,750
these are these are landmarks that that
we're that we're used to and and it

6096
01:44:05,750 --> 01:44:05,760
we're that we're used to and and it
 

6097
01:44:05,760 --> 01:44:07,669
we're that we're used to and and it
allows us to make very um kind of Rapid

6098
01:44:07,669 --> 01:44:07,679
allows us to make very um kind of Rapid
 

6099
01:44:07,679 --> 01:44:10,189
allows us to make very um kind of Rapid
judgments about things but if you can't

6100
01:44:10,189 --> 01:44:10,199
judgments about things but if you can't
 

6101
01:44:10,199 --> 01:44:12,109
judgments about things but if you can't
rely on that either because you're

6102
01:44:12,109 --> 01:44:12,119
rely on that either because you're
 

6103
01:44:12,119 --> 01:44:14,330
rely on that either because you're
looking at a synthetic thing or or an

6104
01:44:14,330 --> 01:44:14,340
looking at a synthetic thing or or an
 

6105
01:44:14,340 --> 01:44:16,609
looking at a synthetic thing or or an
engineered thing or an alien thing then

6106
01:44:16,609 --> 01:44:16,619
engineered thing or an alien thing then
 

6107
01:44:16,619 --> 01:44:18,350
engineered thing or an alien thing then
what do you do right how do you and so

6108
01:44:18,350 --> 01:44:18,360
what do you do right how do you and so
 

6109
01:44:18,360 --> 01:44:19,550
what do you do right how do you and so
and so that's what I'm really interested

6110
01:44:19,550 --> 01:44:19,560
and so that's what I'm really interested
 

6111
01:44:19,560 --> 01:44:22,189
and so that's what I'm really interested
I'm interested in mind in all of its

6112
01:44:22,189 --> 01:44:22,199
I'm interested in mind in all of its
 

6113
01:44:22,199 --> 01:44:24,709
I'm interested in mind in all of its
possible implementations not just the

6114
01:44:24,709 --> 01:44:24,719
possible implementations not just the
 

6115
01:44:24,719 --> 01:44:26,570
possible implementations not just the
obvious ones that we know from from

6116
01:44:26,570 --> 01:44:26,580
obvious ones that we know from from
 

6117
01:44:26,580 --> 01:44:29,090
obvious ones that we know from from
looking at brains here on Earth

6118
01:44:29,090 --> 01:44:29,100
looking at brains here on Earth
 

6119
01:44:29,100 --> 01:44:31,250
looking at brains here on Earth
whenever I think about something like

6120
01:44:31,250 --> 01:44:31,260
whenever I think about something like
 

6121
01:44:31,260 --> 01:44:33,530
whenever I think about something like
unconventional cognition I think about

6122
01:44:33,530 --> 01:44:33,540
unconventional cognition I think about
 

6123
01:44:33,540 --> 01:44:36,470
unconventional cognition I think about
cellular automata I'm just captivated by

6124
01:44:36,470 --> 01:44:36,480
cellular automata I'm just captivated by
 

6125
01:44:36,480 --> 01:44:38,330
cellular automata I'm just captivated by
the beauty of the thing

6126
01:44:38,330 --> 01:44:38,340
the beauty of the thing
 

6127
01:44:38,340 --> 01:44:42,189
the beauty of the thing
the fact that from simple little

6128
01:44:42,189 --> 01:44:42,199
the fact that from simple little
 

6129
01:44:42,199 --> 01:44:45,229
the fact that from simple little
uh objects you can create some such

6130
01:44:45,229 --> 01:44:45,239
uh objects you can create some such
 

6131
01:44:45,239 --> 01:44:48,010
uh objects you can create some such
beautiful complexity that very quickly

6132
01:44:48,010 --> 01:44:48,020
beautiful complexity that very quickly
 

6133
01:44:48,020 --> 01:44:51,109
beautiful complexity that very quickly
you forget about the individual objects

6134
01:44:51,109 --> 01:44:51,119
you forget about the individual objects
 

6135
01:44:51,119 --> 01:44:53,149
you forget about the individual objects
and you see the things that it creates

6136
01:44:53,149 --> 01:44:53,159
and you see the things that it creates
 

6137
01:44:53,159 --> 01:44:56,149
and you see the things that it creates
as its own organisms that blows my mind

6138
01:44:56,149 --> 01:44:56,159
as its own organisms that blows my mind
 

6139
01:44:56,159 --> 01:44:59,450
as its own organisms that blows my mind
every time like honestly

6140
01:44:59,450 --> 01:44:59,460
every time like honestly
 

6141
01:44:59,460 --> 01:45:01,910
every time like honestly
I could full time just

6142
01:45:01,910 --> 01:45:01,920
I could full time just
 

6143
01:45:01,920 --> 01:45:04,250
I could full time just
eat mushrooms and watch cellular time

6144
01:45:04,250 --> 01:45:04,260
eat mushrooms and watch cellular time
 

6145
01:45:04,260 --> 01:45:07,430
eat mushrooms and watch cellular time
don't you have to do mushrooms uh just

6146
01:45:07,430 --> 01:45:07,440
don't you have to do mushrooms uh just
 

6147
01:45:07,440 --> 01:45:11,209
don't you have to do mushrooms uh just
just sell your automata it feels like I

6148
01:45:11,209 --> 01:45:11,219
just sell your automata it feels like I
 

6149
01:45:11,219 --> 01:45:13,250
just sell your automata it feels like I
mean from an engineering perspective I

6150
01:45:13,250 --> 01:45:13,260
mean from an engineering perspective I
 

6151
01:45:13,260 --> 01:45:14,030

you can study that system to understand
 

6159

um well how do I have a xenobot on a
 

6179
01:45:46,739 --> 01:45:48,890
um well how do I have a xenobot on a
podcast that's really a really

6180
01:45:48,890 --> 01:45:48,900
podcast that's really a really
 

6181
01:45:48,900 --> 01:45:50,750
podcast that's really a really
interesting line of um investigation

6182
01:45:50,750 --> 01:45:50,760
interesting line of um investigation
 

6183
01:45:50,760 --> 01:45:53,090
interesting line of um investigation
that that that that opens up I mean I

6184
01:45:53,090 --> 01:45:53,100
that that that that opens up I mean I
 

6185
01:45:53,100 --> 01:45:55,070
that that that that opens up I mean I
mean we thought about this so you need a

6186
01:45:55,070 --> 01:45:55,080
mean we thought about this so you need a
 

6187
01:45:55,080 --> 01:45:56,090
mean we thought about this so you need a
few things you need you need to

6188
01:45:56,090 --> 01:45:56,100
few things you need you need to
 

6189
01:45:56,100 --> 01:45:57,530
few things you need you need to
understand the space in which they live

6190
01:45:57,530 --> 01:45:57,540
understand the space in which they live
 

6191
01:45:57,540 --> 01:46:00,890
understand the space in which they live
so uh what not not just the physical

6192
01:46:00,890 --> 01:46:00,900
so uh what not not just the physical
 

6193
01:46:00,900 --> 01:46:02,629
so uh what not not just the physical
modality like can they see like can they

6194
01:46:02,629 --> 01:46:02,639
modality like can they see like can they
 

6195
01:46:02,639 --> 01:46:03,950
modality like can they see like can they
feel vibration I mean that's important

6196
01:46:03,950 --> 01:46:03,960
feel vibration I mean that's important
 

6197
01:46:03,960 --> 01:46:04,970
feel vibration I mean that's important
of course because that's how you deliver

6198
01:46:04,970 --> 01:46:04,980
of course because that's how you deliver
 

6199
01:46:04,980 --> 01:46:06,830
of course because that's how you deliver
your message but but not just not just

6200
01:46:06,830 --> 01:46:06,840
your message but but not just not just
 

6201
01:46:06,840 --> 01:46:09,050
your message but but not just not just
the ideas for a communication medium not

6202
01:46:09,050 --> 01:46:09,060
the ideas for a communication medium not
 

6203
01:46:09,060 --> 01:46:11,570
the ideas for a communication medium not
not just the physical medium but what is

6204
01:46:11,570 --> 01:46:11,580
not just the physical medium but what is
 

6205
01:46:11,580 --> 01:46:13,729
not just the physical medium but what is
saliency right so so what are these what

6206
01:46:13,729 --> 01:46:13,739
saliency right so so what are these what
 

6207
01:46:13,739 --> 01:46:15,530
saliency right so so what are these what
what are important to this what's

6208
01:46:15,530 --> 01:46:15,540
what are important to this what's
 

6209
01:46:15,540 --> 01:46:18,350
what are important to this what's
important to this system and systems of

6210
01:46:18,350 --> 01:46:18,360
important to this system and systems of
 

6211
01:46:18,360 --> 01:46:20,030
important to this system and systems of
all kinds of different levels of

01:46:22,189 --> 01:46:22,199
sophistication of what you could expect
 

6215
01:46:22,199 --> 01:46:24,709
sophistication of what you could expect
to get back and I I think what's what's

6216
01:46:24,709 --> 01:46:24,719
to get back and I I think what's what's
 

6217
01:46:24,719 --> 01:46:26,810
to get back and I I think what's what's
really important I call this um the the

01:46:26,810 --> 01:46:26,820
really important I call this um the the
 

6219
01:46:26,820 --> 01:46:29,090
really important I call this um the the
spectrum of persuadability which is this

01:46:29,090 --> 01:46:29,100
spectrum of persuadability which is this
 

6221
01:46:29,100 --> 01:46:30,410

system you can't you can't assume where
on the Spectrum it is you have to do

6226
01:46:34,669 --> 01:46:34,679
on the Spectrum it is you have to do
 

6227
01:46:34,679 --> 01:46:37,490
on the Spectrum it is you have to do
experiments and so so for so so

6228
01:46:37,490 --> 01:46:37,500
experiments and so so for so so
 

6229
01:46:37,500 --> 01:46:40,850
experiments and so so for so so
uh for example uh if you look at a gene

6230
01:46:40,850 --> 01:46:40,860
uh for example uh if you look at a gene
 

6231
01:46:40,860 --> 01:46:42,229
uh for example uh if you look at a gene
regulatory Network which is just a bunch

6232
01:46:42,229 --> 01:46:42,239
regulatory Network which is just a bunch
 

6233
01:46:42,239 --> 01:46:43,910
regulatory Network which is just a bunch
of bunch of nodes that turn each other

6234
01:46:43,910 --> 01:46:43,920
of bunch of nodes that turn each other
 

6235
01:46:43,920 --> 01:46:45,950
of bunch of nodes that turn each other
on and off at various rates you might

6236
01:46:45,950 --> 01:46:45,960
on and off at various rates you might
 

6237
01:46:45,960 --> 01:46:47,090
on and off at various rates you might
look at that and you say wow there's no

6238
01:46:47,090 --> 01:46:47,100
look at that and you say wow there's no
 

6239
01:46:47,100 --> 01:46:48,649
look at that and you say wow there's no
magic here I mean clearly this thing is

6240
01:46:48,649 --> 01:46:48,659
magic here I mean clearly this thing is
 

6241
01:46:48,659 --> 01:46:50,990
magic here I mean clearly this thing is
uh is is as deterministic as it gets

6242
01:46:50,990 --> 01:46:51,000
uh is is as deterministic as it gets
 

6243
01:46:51,000 --> 01:46:52,490
uh is is as deterministic as it gets
it's a piece of Hardware the only way

6244
01:46:52,490 --> 01:46:52,500
it's a piece of Hardware the only way
 

6245
01:46:52,500 --> 01:46:54,410
it's a piece of Hardware the only way
we're going to be able to control it is

6246
01:46:54,410 --> 01:46:54,420
we're going to be able to control it is
 

6247
01:46:54,420 --> 01:46:55,729
we're going to be able to control it is
by rewiring it which is the way my

6248
01:46:55,729 --> 01:46:55,739
by rewiring it which is the way my
 

6249
01:46:55,739 --> 01:46:57,290
by rewiring it which is the way my
molecular biology works right we can add

6250
01:46:57,290 --> 01:46:57,300
molecular biology works right we can add
 

6251
01:46:57,300 --> 01:46:59,030
molecular biology works right we can add
nodes remove notes or whatever well so

6252
01:46:59,030 --> 01:46:59,040
nodes remove notes or whatever well so
 

6253
01:46:59,040 --> 01:47:01,430
nodes remove notes or whatever well so
we've done simulations and shown that

6254
01:47:01,430 --> 01:47:01,440
we've done simulations and shown that
 

6255
01:47:01,440 --> 01:47:03,109
we've done simulations and shown that
um biological and now we're doing this

6256
01:47:03,109 --> 01:47:03,119
um biological and now we're doing this
 

6257
01:47:03,119 --> 01:47:05,629
um biological and now we're doing this
in in the lab the biological networks

6258
01:47:05,629 --> 01:47:05,639
in in the lab the biological networks
 

6259
01:47:05,639 --> 01:47:07,729
in in the lab the biological networks
like that have have associative memory

6260
01:47:07,729 --> 01:47:07,739
like that have have associative memory
 

6261
01:47:07,739 --> 01:47:09,410
like that have have associative memory
so they can actually learn they can

6262
01:47:09,410 --> 01:47:09,420
so they can actually learn they can
 

6263
01:47:09,420 --> 01:47:10,669
so they can actually learn they can
learn from experience they have

6264
01:47:10,669 --> 01:47:10,679
learn from experience they have
 

6265
01:47:10,679 --> 01:47:12,229
learn from experience they have
habituation they have sensitization they

6266
01:47:12,229 --> 01:47:12,239
habituation they have sensitization they
 

6267
01:47:12,239 --> 01:47:13,550
habituation they have sensitization they
have associative memory which you

6268
01:47:13,550 --> 01:47:13,560
have associative memory which you
 

6269
01:47:13,560 --> 01:47:15,470
have associative memory which you
wouldn't have known if you assume that

6270
01:47:15,470 --> 01:47:15,480
wouldn't have known if you assume that
 

6271
01:47:15,480 --> 01:47:16,729
wouldn't have known if you assume that
they have to be on the left side of that

6272
01:47:16,729 --> 01:47:16,739
they have to be on the left side of that
 

6273
01:47:16,739 --> 01:47:18,290
they have to be on the left side of that
Spectrum so when you're going to

6274
01:47:18,290 --> 01:47:18,300
Spectrum so when you're going to
 

6275
01:47:18,300 --> 01:47:19,550
Spectrum so when you're going to
communicate with something and we've

6276
01:47:19,550 --> 01:47:19,560
communicate with something and we've
 

6277
01:47:19,560 --> 01:47:22,490
communicate with something and we've
even um uh uh Charles Abramson I've

6278
01:47:22,490 --> 01:47:22,500
even um uh uh Charles Abramson I've
 

6279
01:47:22,500 --> 01:47:24,770
even um uh uh Charles Abramson I've
written a paper on um behaviorist

6280
01:47:24,770 --> 01:47:24,780
written a paper on um behaviorist
 

6281
01:47:24,780 --> 01:47:26,510
written a paper on um behaviorist
approaches to synthetic organism meaning

6282
01:47:26,510 --> 01:47:26,520
approaches to synthetic organism meaning
 

6283
01:47:26,520 --> 01:47:27,830
approaches to synthetic organism meaning
that if you're given something you have

6284
01:47:27,830 --> 01:47:27,840
that if you're given something you have
 

6285
01:47:27,840 --> 01:47:30,169
that if you're given something you have
no idea what it is or what it can do how

6286
01:47:30,169 --> 01:47:30,179
no idea what it is or what it can do how
 

6287
01:47:30,179 --> 01:47:32,330
no idea what it is or what it can do how
do you figure out what its psychology is

6288
01:47:32,330 --> 01:47:32,340
do you figure out what its psychology is
 

6289
01:47:32,340 --> 01:47:33,830
do you figure out what its psychology is
what its level is what does it and so

6290
01:47:33,830 --> 01:47:33,840
what its level is what does it and so
 

6291
01:47:33,840 --> 01:47:35,689
what its level is what does it and so
and so we literally lay out a set of

6292
01:47:35,689 --> 01:47:35,699
and so we literally lay out a set of
 

6293
01:47:35,699 --> 01:47:37,189
and so we literally lay out a set of
protocols starting with the simplest

6294
01:47:37,189 --> 01:47:37,199
protocols starting with the simplest
 

6295
01:47:37,199 --> 01:47:38,390
protocols starting with the simplest
things that I'm moving up to more

6296
01:47:38,390 --> 01:47:38,400
things that I'm moving up to more
 

6297
01:47:38,400 --> 01:47:39,890
things that I'm moving up to more
complex things where you can make no

6298
01:47:39,890 --> 01:47:39,900
complex things where you can make no
 

6299
01:47:39,900 --> 01:47:41,390
complex things where you can make no
assumptions about what this thing can do

6300
01:47:41,390 --> 01:47:41,400
assumptions about what this thing can do
 

6301
01:47:41,400 --> 01:47:42,830
assumptions about what this thing can do
right just from you you have to start

6302
01:47:42,830 --> 01:47:42,840
right just from you you have to start
 

6303
01:47:42,840 --> 01:47:44,209
right just from you you have to start
and you'll find out

6304
01:47:44,209 --> 01:47:44,219
and you'll find out
 

6305
01:47:44,219 --> 01:47:46,310
and you'll find out
so so when you're gonna so so here's a

6306
01:47:46,310 --> 01:47:46,320
so so when you're gonna so so here's a
 

6307
01:47:46,320 --> 01:47:47,390
so so when you're gonna so so here's a
simple I mean here's one way to

6308
01:47:47,390 --> 01:47:47,400
simple I mean here's one way to
 

6309
01:47:47,400 --> 01:47:48,590
simple I mean here's one way to
communicate with something if you can

6310
01:47:48,590 --> 01:47:48,600
communicate with something if you can
 

6311
01:47:48,600 --> 01:47:49,669
communicate with something if you can
train it

6312
01:47:49,669 --> 01:47:49,679
train it
 

6313
01:47:49,679 --> 01:47:51,649
train it
that's a way of communicating so if you

6314
01:47:51,649 --> 01:47:51,659
that's a way of communicating so if you
 

6315
01:47:51,659 --> 01:47:53,090
that's a way of communicating so if you
can provide if you can figure out what

6316
01:47:53,090 --> 01:47:53,100
can provide if you can figure out what
 

6317
01:47:53,100 --> 01:47:55,310
can provide if you can figure out what
the currency of reward of positive and

6318
01:47:55,310 --> 01:47:55,320
the currency of reward of positive and
 

6319
01:47:55,320 --> 01:47:57,770
the currency of reward of positive and
negative reinforcement is right and you

6320
01:47:57,770 --> 01:47:57,780
negative reinforcement is right and you
 

6321
01:47:57,780 --> 01:47:59,209
negative reinforcement is right and you
can get it to do something it wasn't

6322
01:47:59,209 --> 01:47:59,219
can get it to do something it wasn't
 

6323
01:47:59,219 --> 01:48:01,729
can get it to do something it wasn't
doing before based on experiences you've

6324
01:48:01,729 --> 01:48:01,739
doing before based on experiences you've
 

6325
01:48:01,739 --> 01:48:03,649
doing before based on experiences you've
given it you have taught it one thing

6326
01:48:03,649 --> 01:48:03,659
given it you have taught it one thing
 

6327
01:48:03,659 --> 01:48:05,390
given it you have taught it one thing
you have communicated one thing that

6328
01:48:05,390 --> 01:48:05,400
you have communicated one thing that
 

6329
01:48:05,400 --> 01:48:07,129
you have communicated one thing that
that such and such an action is good so

6330
01:48:07,129 --> 01:48:07,139
that such and such an action is good so
 

6331
01:48:07,139 --> 01:48:09,109
that such and such an action is good so
some other action is is not good that's

6332
01:48:09,109 --> 01:48:09,119
some other action is is not good that's
 

6333
01:48:09,119 --> 01:48:11,390
some other action is is not good that's
that's like a basic atom of a primitive

6334
01:48:11,390 --> 01:48:11,400
that's like a basic atom of a primitive
 

6335
01:48:11,400 --> 01:48:14,149
that's like a basic atom of a primitive
atom of communication what about

6336
01:48:14,149 --> 01:48:14,159
atom of communication what about
 

6337
01:48:14,159 --> 01:48:17,570
atom of communication what about
in some sense if it gets you to do

6338
01:48:17,570 --> 01:48:17,580
in some sense if it gets you to do
 

6339
01:48:17,580 --> 01:48:19,729
in some sense if it gets you to do
something you haven't done before is it

6340
01:48:19,729 --> 01:48:19,739
something you haven't done before is it
 

6341
01:48:19,739 --> 01:48:22,010
something you haven't done before is it
answering back yeah most most certainly

6342
01:48:22,010 --> 01:48:22,020
answering back yeah most most certainly
 

6343
01:48:22,020 --> 01:48:23,390
answering back yeah most most certainly
and then there's there's I've seen

6344
01:48:23,390 --> 01:48:23,400
and then there's there's I've seen
 

6345
01:48:23,400 --> 01:48:25,310
and then there's there's I've seen
cartoons I think maybe Gary Larson or

6346
01:48:25,310 --> 01:48:25,320
cartoons I think maybe Gary Larson or
 

6347
01:48:25,320 --> 01:48:26,930
cartoons I think maybe Gary Larson or
somebody had had a cartoon of these of

6348
01:48:26,930 --> 01:48:26,940
somebody had had a cartoon of these of
 

6349
01:48:26,940 --> 01:48:28,790
somebody had had a cartoon of these of
these rats in the Maze and the one rat

6350
01:48:28,790 --> 01:48:28,800
these rats in the Maze and the one rat
 

6351
01:48:28,800 --> 01:48:30,290
these rats in the Maze and the one rat
you know assists to the other hey look

6352
01:48:30,290 --> 01:48:30,300
you know assists to the other hey look
 

6353
01:48:30,300 --> 01:48:31,669
you know assists to the other hey look
at this every time every time I walk

6354
01:48:31,669 --> 01:48:31,679
at this every time every time I walk
 

6355
01:48:31,679 --> 01:48:33,229
at this every time every time I walk
over here he starts scribbling in that

6356
01:48:33,229 --> 01:48:33,239
over here he starts scribbling in that
 

6357
01:48:33,239 --> 01:48:34,609
over here he starts scribbling in that
on the you know almost the clipboard

6358
01:48:34,609 --> 01:48:34,619
on the you know almost the clipboard
 

6359
01:48:34,619 --> 01:48:36,350
on the you know almost the clipboard
that he has it's awesome if we step

6360
01:48:36,350 --> 01:48:36,360
that he has it's awesome if we step
 

6361
01:48:36,360 --> 01:48:38,629
that he has it's awesome if we step
outside ourselves

6362
01:48:38,629 --> 01:48:38,639
outside ourselves
 

6363
01:48:38,639 --> 01:48:43,250
outside ourselves
and really measure how much like if I if

6364
01:48:43,250 --> 01:48:43,260
and really measure how much like if I if
 

6365
01:48:43,260 --> 01:48:45,470
and really measure how much like if I if
I actually measure how much I've changed

6366
01:48:45,470 --> 01:48:45,480
I actually measure how much I've changed
 

6367
01:48:45,480 --> 01:48:48,229
I actually measure how much I've changed
because of my interaction with certain

6368
01:48:48,229 --> 01:48:48,239
because of my interaction with certain
 

6369
01:48:48,239 --> 01:48:51,229
because of my interaction with certain
cellular automata and you really have to

6370
01:48:51,229 --> 01:48:51,239
cellular automata and you really have to
 

6371
01:48:51,239 --> 01:48:53,689
cellular automata and you really have to
take that it's a consideration about

6372
01:48:53,689 --> 01:48:53,699
take that it's a consideration about
 

6373
01:48:53,699 --> 01:48:56,390
take that it's a consideration about
like well these things are changing you

6374
01:48:56,390 --> 01:48:56,400
like well these things are changing you
 

6375
01:48:56,400 --> 01:48:59,450
like well these things are changing you
too yes I know you know how it works and

6376
01:48:59,450 --> 01:48:59,460
too yes I know you know how it works and
 

6377
01:48:59,460 --> 01:49:01,790
too yes I know you know how it works and
so on but you're being changed by the

6378
01:49:01,790 --> 01:49:01,800
so on but you're being changed by the
 

6379
01:49:01,800 --> 01:49:04,250
so on but you're being changed by the
thing absolutely I think I think I read

6380
01:49:04,250 --> 01:49:04,260
thing absolutely I think I think I read
 

6381
01:49:04,260 --> 01:49:05,629
thing absolutely I think I think I read
um I don't know any details but I I

6382
01:49:05,629 --> 01:49:05,639
um I don't know any details but I I
 

6383
01:49:05,639 --> 01:49:07,250
um I don't know any details but I I
think I read something about

6384
01:49:07,250 --> 01:49:07,260
think I read something about
 

6385
01:49:07,260 --> 01:49:08,990
think I read something about
um how how wheat and other things of

6386
01:49:08,990 --> 01:49:09,000
um how how wheat and other things of
 

6387
01:49:09,000 --> 01:49:11,330
um how how wheat and other things of
domesticated humans in terms right but

6388
01:49:11,330 --> 01:49:11,340
domesticated humans in terms right but
 

6389
01:49:11,340 --> 01:49:13,550
domesticated humans in terms right but
by their properties change the way that

6390
01:49:13,550 --> 01:49:13,560
by their properties change the way that
 

6391
01:49:13,560 --> 01:49:15,229
by their properties change the way that
the human behavior and societal

6392
01:49:15,229 --> 01:49:15,239
the human behavior and societal
 

6393
01:49:15,239 --> 01:49:17,649
the human behavior and societal
structures in that sense cats are

6394
01:49:17,649 --> 01:49:17,659
structures in that sense cats are
 

6395
01:49:17,659 --> 01:49:20,209
structures in that sense cats are
running the world

6396
01:49:20,209 --> 01:49:20,219
running the world
 

6397
01:49:20,219 --> 01:49:22,550
running the world
because they they took over the so first

6398
01:49:22,550 --> 01:49:22,560
because they they took over the so first
 

6399
01:49:22,560 --> 01:49:26,330
because they they took over the so first
of all so first they while not giving a

6400
01:49:26,330 --> 01:49:26,340
of all so first they while not giving a
 

6401
01:49:26,340 --> 01:49:28,669
of all so first they while not giving a
[\h__\h] about humans clearly would ever

6402
01:49:28,669 --> 01:49:28,679
[\h__\h] about humans clearly would ever
 

6403
01:49:28,679 --> 01:49:31,090
[\h__\h] about humans clearly would ever
with with every ounce of their being

6404
01:49:31,090 --> 01:49:31,100
with with every ounce of their being
 

6405
01:49:31,100 --> 01:49:34,850
with with every ounce of their being
they've somehow got just millions and

6406
01:49:34,850 --> 01:49:34,860
they've somehow got just millions and
 

6407
01:49:34,860 --> 01:49:37,669
they've somehow got just millions and
millions of humans to to to to take them

6408
01:49:37,669 --> 01:49:37,679
millions of humans to to to to take them
 

6409
01:49:37,679 --> 01:49:41,629
millions of humans to to to to take them
home and feed them and then not only the

6410
01:49:41,629 --> 01:49:41,639
home and feed them and then not only the
 

6411
01:49:41,639 --> 01:49:43,669
home and feed them and then not only the
physical space that they take over they

6412
01:49:43,669 --> 01:49:43,679
physical space that they take over they
 

6413
01:49:43,679 --> 01:49:45,470
physical space that they take over they
took over the digital space they

6414
01:49:45,470 --> 01:49:45,480
took over the digital space they
 

6415
01:49:45,480 --> 01:49:47,750
took over the digital space they
dominate the internet in terms of

6416
01:49:47,750 --> 01:49:47,760
dominate the internet in terms of
 

6417
01:49:47,760 --> 01:49:50,390
dominate the internet in terms of
cuteness in terms of immutability

6418
01:49:50,390 --> 01:49:50,400
cuteness in terms of immutability
 

6419
01:49:50,400 --> 01:49:53,390
cuteness in terms of immutability
and so they're they're like they got

6420
01:49:53,390 --> 01:49:53,400
and so they're they're like they got
 

6421
01:49:53,400 --> 01:49:55,729
and so they're they're like they got
themselves literally inside the memes

6422
01:49:55,729 --> 01:49:55,739
themselves literally inside the memes
 

6423
01:49:55,739 --> 01:49:57,950
themselves literally inside the memes
they become viral and spread on the

6424
01:49:57,950 --> 01:49:57,960
they become viral and spread on the
 

6425
01:49:57,960 --> 01:49:58,910
they become viral and spread on the
internet

6426
01:49:58,910 --> 01:49:58,920
internet
 

6427
01:49:58,920 --> 01:50:00,830
internet
and they're the ones that are probably

6428
01:50:00,830 --> 01:50:00,840
and they're the ones that are probably
 

6429
01:50:00,840 --> 01:50:02,510
and they're the ones that are probably
controlling humans that's my theory

6430
01:50:02,510 --> 01:50:02,520
controlling humans that's my theory
 

6431
01:50:02,520 --> 01:50:04,609
controlling humans that's my theory
another that's a follow-up paper after

6432
01:50:04,609 --> 01:50:04,619
another that's a follow-up paper after
 

6433
01:50:04,619 --> 01:50:06,830
another that's a follow-up paper after
the frog kissing okay

6434
01:50:06,830 --> 01:50:06,840
the frog kissing okay
 

6435
01:50:06,840 --> 01:50:10,850
the frog kissing okay
I mean you mentioned

6436
01:50:10,850 --> 01:50:10,860

 

6437
01:50:10,860 --> 01:50:13,370

sentience and consciousness

6438
01:50:13,370 --> 01:50:13,380
sentience and consciousness
 

6439
01:50:13,380 --> 01:50:17,629
sentience and consciousness
uh you have a paper titled generalizing

6440
01:50:17,629 --> 01:50:17,639
uh you have a paper titled generalizing
 

6441
01:50:17,639 --> 01:50:20,090
uh you have a paper titled generalizing
Frameworks for sentience Beyond natural

6442
01:50:20,090 --> 01:50:20,100
Frameworks for sentience Beyond natural
 

6443
01:50:20,100 --> 01:50:22,490
Frameworks for sentience Beyond natural
species

6444
01:50:22,490 --> 01:50:22,500
species
 

6445
01:50:22,500 --> 01:50:25,129
species
so beyond

6446
01:50:25,129 --> 01:50:25,139
so beyond
 

6447
01:50:25,139 --> 01:50:29,229
so beyond
normal cognition if we look at

6448
01:50:29,229 --> 01:50:29,239
normal cognition if we look at
 

6449
01:50:29,239 --> 01:50:31,729
normal cognition if we look at
sentience and Consciousness and I wonder

6450
01:50:31,729 --> 01:50:31,739
sentience and Consciousness and I wonder
 

6451
01:50:31,739 --> 01:50:33,410
sentience and Consciousness and I wonder
if you draw an interesting distinction

6452
01:50:33,410 --> 01:50:33,420
if you draw an interesting distinction
 

6453
01:50:33,420 --> 01:50:37,550
if you draw an interesting distinction
between those two uh elsewhere

6454
01:50:37,550 --> 01:50:37,560
between those two uh elsewhere
 

6455
01:50:37,560 --> 01:50:40,850
between those two uh elsewhere
outside of humans and uh maybe outside

6456
01:50:40,850 --> 01:50:40,860
outside of humans and uh maybe outside
 

6457
01:50:40,860 --> 01:50:42,109
outside of humans and uh maybe outside
of Earth

6458
01:50:42,109 --> 01:50:42,119
of Earth
 

6459
01:50:42,119 --> 01:50:45,590
of Earth
you think aliens are half sentients and

6460
01:50:45,590 --> 01:50:45,600
you think aliens are half sentients and
 

6461
01:50:45,600 --> 01:50:48,290
you think aliens are half sentients and
if they do how do we think about it so

6462
01:50:48,290 --> 01:50:48,300
if they do how do we think about it so
 

6463
01:50:48,300 --> 01:50:50,629
if they do how do we think about it so
when you have this framework what is

6464
01:50:50,629 --> 01:50:50,639
when you have this framework what is
 

6465
01:50:50,639 --> 01:50:52,609
when you have this framework what is
this paper what is what is the way you

6466
01:50:52,609 --> 01:50:52,619
this paper what is what is the way you
 

6467
01:50:52,619 --> 01:50:54,950
this paper what is what is the way you
propose to think about ascensions yeah

6468
01:50:54,950 --> 01:50:54,960
propose to think about ascensions yeah
 

6469
01:50:54,960 --> 01:50:57,290
propose to think about ascensions yeah
that that particular paper was was a

6470
01:50:57,290 --> 01:50:57,300
that that particular paper was was a
 

6471
01:50:57,300 --> 01:50:58,970
that that particular paper was was a
very short um commentary on another

6472
01:50:58,970 --> 01:50:58,980
very short um commentary on another
 

6473
01:50:58,980 --> 01:51:00,950
very short um commentary on another
paper that was written about crabs

6474
01:51:00,950 --> 01:51:00,960
paper that was written about crabs
 

6475
01:51:00,960 --> 01:51:02,870
paper that was written about crabs
there's a really good paper on them uh

6476
01:51:02,870 --> 01:51:02,880
there's a really good paper on them uh
 

6477
01:51:02,880 --> 01:51:05,030
there's a really good paper on them uh
crabs and and various like like a rubric

6478
01:51:05,030 --> 01:51:05,040
crabs and and various like like a rubric
 

6479
01:51:05,040 --> 01:51:07,790
crabs and and various like like a rubric
of uh of different types of behaviors

6480
01:51:07,790 --> 01:51:07,800
of uh of different types of behaviors
 

6481
01:51:07,800 --> 01:51:09,290
of uh of different types of behaviors
that that could be applied to different

6482
01:51:09,290 --> 01:51:09,300
that that could be applied to different
 

6483
01:51:09,300 --> 01:51:10,550
that that could be applied to different
creatures and they're trying to apply it

6484
01:51:10,550 --> 01:51:10,560
creatures and they're trying to apply it
 

6485
01:51:10,560 --> 01:51:13,450
creatures and they're trying to apply it
to crabs and so on them I I've

6486
01:51:13,450 --> 01:51:13,460
to crabs and so on them I I've
 

6487
01:51:13,460 --> 01:51:15,830
to crabs and so on them I I've
Consciousness we can talk about a

6488
01:51:15,830 --> 01:51:15,840
Consciousness we can talk about a
 

6489
01:51:15,840 --> 01:51:17,030
Consciousness we can talk about a
feeling but it's a whole separate kettle

6490
01:51:17,030 --> 01:51:17,040
feeling but it's a whole separate kettle
 

6491
01:51:17,040 --> 01:51:19,669
feeling but it's a whole separate kettle
of fish I I I almost never talk about

6492
01:51:19,669 --> 01:51:19,679
of fish I I I almost never talk about
 

6493
01:51:19,679 --> 01:51:23,330
of fish I I I almost never talk about
crabs in this case yes I almost never

6494
01:51:23,330 --> 01:51:23,340
crabs in this case yes I almost never
 

6495
01:51:23,340 --> 01:51:25,010
crabs in this case yes I almost never
talk about Consciousness per se I've

6496
01:51:25,010 --> 01:51:25,020
talk about Consciousness per se I've
 

6497
01:51:25,020 --> 01:51:26,689
talk about Consciousness per se I've
said very very little about it but we

6498
01:51:26,689 --> 01:51:26,699
said very very little about it but we
 

6499
01:51:26,699 --> 01:51:27,770
said very very little about it but we
can we can talk about it if you want

6500
01:51:27,770 --> 01:51:27,780
can we can talk about it if you want
 

6501
01:51:27,780 --> 01:51:30,350
can we can talk about it if you want
mostly what I talk about is is cognition

6502
01:51:30,350 --> 01:51:30,360
mostly what I talk about is is cognition
 

6503
01:51:30,360 --> 01:51:32,990
mostly what I talk about is is cognition
because I think that that's much easier

6504
01:51:32,990 --> 01:51:33,000
because I think that that's much easier
 

6505
01:51:33,000 --> 01:51:35,570
because I think that that's much easier
to deal with in a um kind of rigorous

6506
01:51:35,570 --> 01:51:35,580
to deal with in a um kind of rigorous
 

6507
01:51:35,580 --> 01:51:38,090
to deal with in a um kind of rigorous
experimental experimental way I think

6508
01:51:38,090 --> 01:51:38,100
experimental experimental way I think
 

6509
01:51:38,100 --> 01:51:41,270
experimental experimental way I think
that um all of these all of these terms

6510
01:51:41,270 --> 01:51:41,280
that um all of these all of these terms
 

6511
01:51:41,280 --> 01:51:44,629
that um all of these all of these terms
have uh you know sentience and and so on

6512
01:51:44,629 --> 01:51:44,639
have uh you know sentience and and so on
 

6513
01:51:44,639 --> 01:51:48,229
have uh you know sentience and and so on
have different definitions and I

6514
01:51:48,229 --> 01:51:48,239
have different definitions and I
 

6515
01:51:48,239 --> 01:51:51,470
have different definitions and I
fundamentally I think that people can as

6516
01:51:51,470 --> 01:51:51,480
fundamentally I think that people can as
 

6517
01:51:51,480 --> 01:51:52,970
fundamentally I think that people can as
long as they specify what they mean

6518
01:51:52,970 --> 01:51:52,980
long as they specify what they mean
 

6519
01:51:52,980 --> 01:51:54,530
long as they specify what they mean
ahead of time

6520
01:51:54,530 --> 01:51:54,540
ahead of time
 

6521
01:51:54,540 --> 01:51:56,030
ahead of time
um I think people can Define them in

6522
01:51:56,030 --> 01:51:56,040
um I think people can Define them in
 

6523
01:51:56,040 --> 01:51:57,770
um I think people can Define them in
various ways the one the the the the

6524
01:51:57,770 --> 01:51:57,780
various ways the one the the the the
 

6525
01:51:57,780 --> 01:52:00,169
various ways the one the the the the
only thing that I really kind of insist

6526
01:52:00,169 --> 01:52:00,179
only thing that I really kind of insist
 

6527
01:52:00,179 --> 01:52:01,970
only thing that I really kind of insist
on is that

6528
01:52:01,970 --> 01:52:01,980
on is that
 

6529
01:52:01,980 --> 01:52:04,310
on is that
the right way to think about all this

6530
01:52:04,310 --> 01:52:04,320
the right way to think about all this
 

6531
01:52:04,320 --> 01:52:07,310
the right way to think about all this
stuff is is an energy from an

6532
01:52:07,310 --> 01:52:07,320
stuff is is an energy from an
 

6533
01:52:07,320 --> 01:52:08,810
stuff is is an energy from an
engineering perspective what does it

6534
01:52:08,810 --> 01:52:08,820
engineering perspective what does it
 

6535
01:52:08,820 --> 01:52:12,290
engineering perspective what does it
help me to to control predict and uh to

6536
01:52:12,290 --> 01:52:12,300
help me to to control predict and uh to
 

6537
01:52:12,300 --> 01:52:13,430
help me to to control predict and uh to
and does it help me do my next

6538
01:52:13,430 --> 01:52:13,440
and does it help me do my next
 

6539
01:52:13,440 --> 01:52:16,189
and does it help me do my next
experiment so so so so that that's

6540
01:52:16,189 --> 01:52:16,199
experiment so so so so that that's
 

6541
01:52:16,199 --> 01:52:17,930
experiment so so so so that that's
that's not a universal perspective so

6542
01:52:17,930 --> 01:52:17,940
that's not a universal perspective so
 

6543
01:52:17,940 --> 01:52:21,169
that's not a universal perspective so
some people have uh philosophical kind

6544
01:52:21,169 --> 01:52:21,179
some people have uh philosophical kind
 

6545
01:52:21,179 --> 01:52:23,270
some people have uh philosophical kind
of underpinnings and those are primary

6546
01:52:23,270 --> 01:52:23,280
of underpinnings and those are primary
 

6547
01:52:23,280 --> 01:52:25,490
of underpinnings and those are primary
and if anything runs against that then

6548
01:52:25,490 --> 01:52:25,500
and if anything runs against that then
 

6549
01:52:25,500 --> 01:52:27,290
and if anything runs against that then
it must automatically be wrong so so

6550
01:52:27,290 --> 01:52:27,300
it must automatically be wrong so so
 

6551
01:52:27,300 --> 01:52:29,810
it must automatically be wrong so so
some people will say I don't care what

6552
01:52:29,810 --> 01:52:29,820
some people will say I don't care what
 

6553
01:52:29,820 --> 01:52:31,910
some people will say I don't care what
else if your theory says to me that

6554
01:52:31,910 --> 01:52:31,920
else if your theory says to me that
 

6555
01:52:31,920 --> 01:52:34,609
else if your theory says to me that
thermostats have little tiny goals I'm

6556
01:52:34,609 --> 01:52:34,619
thermostats have little tiny goals I'm
 

6557
01:52:34,619 --> 01:52:37,010
thermostats have little tiny goals I'm
not I'm not I'm not so that's it I just

6558
01:52:37,010 --> 01:52:37,020
not I'm not I'm not so that's it I just
 

6559
01:52:37,020 --> 01:52:38,750
not I'm not I'm not so that's it I just
like that's my philosophical you know

6560
01:52:38,750 --> 01:52:38,760
like that's my philosophical you know
 

6561
01:52:38,760 --> 01:52:40,370
like that's my philosophical you know
preconception that like thermostats do

6562
01:52:40,370 --> 01:52:40,380
preconception that like thermostats do
 

6563
01:52:40,380 --> 01:52:42,649
preconception that like thermostats do
not have goals and that's it so um so

6564
01:52:42,649 --> 01:52:42,659
not have goals and that's it so um so
 

6565
01:52:42,659 --> 01:52:43,669
not have goals and that's it so um so
that's one way of doing it and some

6566
01:52:43,669 --> 01:52:43,679
that's one way of doing it and some
 

6567
01:52:43,679 --> 01:52:45,530
that's one way of doing it and some
people do it that way I do not do it

6568
01:52:45,530 --> 01:52:45,540
people do it that way I do not do it
 

6569
01:52:45,540 --> 01:52:47,030
people do it that way I do not do it
that way and I think that we can't if we

6570
01:52:47,030 --> 01:52:47,040
that way and I think that we can't if we
 

6571
01:52:47,040 --> 01:52:49,070
that way and I think that we can't if we
we can't I don't think we can know much

6572
01:52:49,070 --> 01:52:49,080
we can't I don't think we can know much
 

6573
01:52:49,080 --> 01:52:50,209
we can't I don't think we can know much
of anything from our from a

6574
01:52:50,209 --> 01:52:50,219
of anything from our from a
 

6575
01:52:50,219 --> 01:52:52,850
of anything from our from a
philosophical armchair I think that all

6576
01:52:52,850 --> 01:52:52,860
philosophical armchair I think that all
 

6577
01:52:52,860 --> 01:52:54,530
philosophical armchair I think that all
of these theories and ways of doing

6578
01:52:54,530 --> 01:52:54,540
of these theories and ways of doing
 

6579
01:52:54,540 --> 01:52:57,350
of these theories and ways of doing
things stand or fall based on just just

6580
01:52:57,350 --> 01:52:57,360
things stand or fall based on just just
 

6581
01:52:57,360 --> 01:52:59,090
things stand or fall based on just just
basically one set of criteria does it

6582
01:52:59,090 --> 01:52:59,100
basically one set of criteria does it
 

6583
01:52:59,100 --> 01:53:01,010
basically one set of criteria does it
help you run a rich research program

6584
01:53:01,010 --> 01:53:01,020
help you run a rich research program
 

6585
01:53:01,020 --> 01:53:03,229
help you run a rich research program
that's it if I agree with you totally

6586
01:53:03,229 --> 01:53:03,239
that's it if I agree with you totally
 

6587
01:53:03,239 --> 01:53:07,010
that's it if I agree with you totally
but so forget philosophy what about the

6588
01:53:07,010 --> 01:53:07,020
but so forget philosophy what about the
 

6589
01:53:07,020 --> 01:53:09,530
but so forget philosophy what about the
Poetry of ambiguity what about at the

6590
01:53:09,530 --> 01:53:09,540
Poetry of ambiguity what about at the
 

6591
01:53:09,540 --> 01:53:11,629
Poetry of ambiguity what about at the
limits of the things you can engineer

6592
01:53:11,629 --> 01:53:11,639
limits of the things you can engineer
 

6593
01:53:11,639 --> 01:53:14,629
limits of the things you can engineer
using terms that are that can be defined

6594
01:53:14,629 --> 01:53:14,639
using terms that are that can be defined
 

6595
01:53:14,639 --> 01:53:16,189
using terms that are that can be defined
in multiple ways

6596
01:53:16,189 --> 01:53:16,199
in multiple ways
 

6597
01:53:16,199 --> 01:53:18,910
in multiple ways
and living within that yeah

6598
01:53:18,910 --> 01:53:18,920
and living within that yeah
 

6599
01:53:18,920 --> 01:53:22,250
and living within that yeah
uncertainty in order to play with words

6600
01:53:22,250 --> 01:53:22,260
uncertainty in order to play with words
 

6601
01:53:22,260 --> 01:53:24,530
uncertainty in order to play with words
until something lands that you can

6602
01:53:24,530 --> 01:53:24,540
until something lands that you can
 

6603
01:53:24,540 --> 01:53:26,570
until something lands that you can
engineer I mean that's to me where

6604
01:53:26,570 --> 01:53:26,580
engineer I mean that's to me where
 

6605
01:53:26,580 --> 01:53:28,729
engineer I mean that's to me where
Consciousness sits currently nobody

6606
01:53:28,729 --> 01:53:28,739
Consciousness sits currently nobody
 

6607
01:53:28,739 --> 01:53:31,370
Consciousness sits currently nobody
really understands the the hard problem

6608
01:53:31,370 --> 01:53:31,380
really understands the the hard problem
 

6609
01:53:31,380 --> 01:53:33,109
really understands the the hard problem
of Consciousness is the subject what it

6610
01:53:33,109 --> 01:53:33,119
of Consciousness is the subject what it
 

6611
01:53:33,119 --> 01:53:35,810
of Consciousness is the subject what it
feels like because it really feels like

01:53:35,810 --> 01:53:35,820
feels like because it really feels like
 

6613
01:53:35,820 --> 01:53:37,609

it feels like something to be this

it feels like something to be this

competencies feels like something and
 

6621
01:53:45,119 --> 01:53:47,930
competencies feels like something and
yeah I feel like one thing and is that

6622
01:53:47,930 --> 01:53:47,940
yeah I feel like one thing and is that
 

6623
01:53:47,940 --> 01:53:49,970
yeah I feel like one thing and is that
just

6624
01:53:49,970 --> 01:53:49,980
just
 

6625
01:53:49,980 --> 01:53:53,930
just
is that just a as a side effect of a

6626
01:53:53,930 --> 01:53:53,940
is that just a as a side effect of a
 

6627
01:53:53,940 --> 01:53:55,910
is that just a as a side effect of a
complex system

6628
01:53:55,910 --> 01:53:55,920
complex system
 

6629
01:53:55,920 --> 01:53:58,550
complex system
or is there something more

6630
01:53:58,550 --> 01:53:58,560
or is there something more
 

6631
01:53:58,560 --> 01:54:01,250
or is there something more
that humans have or is there something

6632
01:54:01,250 --> 01:54:01,260
that humans have or is there something
 

6633
01:54:01,260 --> 01:54:03,350
that humans have or is there something
more than any biological system has some

6634
01:54:03,350 --> 01:54:03,360
more than any biological system has some
 

6635
01:54:03,360 --> 01:54:05,990
more than any biological system has some
kind of magic some kind of not just the

6636
01:54:05,990 --> 01:54:06,000
kind of magic some kind of not just the
 

6637
01:54:06,000 --> 01:54:10,070
kind of magic some kind of not just the
sense of agency but a real sense with a

6638
01:54:10,070 --> 01:54:10,080
sense of agency but a real sense with a
 

6639
01:54:10,080 --> 01:54:13,070
sense of agency but a real sense with a
capital letter s of agency yeah

6640
01:54:13,070 --> 01:54:13,080
capital letter s of agency yeah
 

6641
01:54:13,080 --> 01:54:15,050
capital letter s of agency yeah
uh boy uh yeah that's a deep question

6642
01:54:15,050 --> 01:54:15,060
uh boy uh yeah that's a deep question
 

6643
01:54:15,060 --> 01:54:17,209
uh boy uh yeah that's a deep question
now is there room for poetry and

6644
01:54:17,209 --> 01:54:17,219
now is there room for poetry and
 

6645
01:54:17,219 --> 01:54:19,550
now is there room for poetry and
Engineering or no no there definitely is

6646
01:54:19,550 --> 01:54:19,560
Engineering or no no there definitely is
 

6647
01:54:19,560 --> 01:54:22,850
Engineering or no no there definitely is
and a lot of the Poetry comes in when we

6648
01:54:22,850 --> 01:54:22,860
and a lot of the Poetry comes in when we
 

6649
01:54:22,860 --> 01:54:24,530
and a lot of the Poetry comes in when we
realize that none of the categories we

6650
01:54:24,530 --> 01:54:24,540
realize that none of the categories we
 

6651
01:54:24,540 --> 01:54:26,270
realize that none of the categories we
deal with are sharp as we think they are

6652
01:54:26,270 --> 01:54:26,280
deal with are sharp as we think they are
 

6653
01:54:26,280 --> 01:54:28,729
deal with are sharp as we think they are
right and so and so in the you know in

6654
01:54:28,729 --> 01:54:28,739
right and so and so in the you know in
 

6655
01:54:28,739 --> 01:54:31,430
right and so and so in the you know in
the different areas of of all these

6656
01:54:31,430 --> 01:54:31,440
the different areas of of all these
 

6657
01:54:31,440 --> 01:54:33,770
the different areas of of all these
Spectra are where a lot of the Poetry

6658
01:54:33,770 --> 01:54:33,780
Spectra are where a lot of the Poetry
 

6659
01:54:33,780 --> 01:54:35,450
Spectra are where a lot of the Poetry
sits I have many new theories about

01:54:35,450 --> 01:54:35,460

6661
01:54:35,460 --> 01:54:37,310

6663
01:54:37,320 --> 01:54:38,990
things but I in fact do not have a a
good theory about Consciousness that I

6664
01:54:38,990 --> 01:54:39,000
good theory about Consciousness that I
 

6665
01:54:39,000 --> 01:54:40,970
good theory about Consciousness that I
plan to trot out so and you almost don't

6666
01:54:40,970 --> 01:54:40,980
plan to trot out so and you almost don't
 

6667
01:54:40,980 --> 01:54:43,270
plan to trot out so and you almost don't
see it as useful for your current work

6668
01:54:43,270 --> 01:54:43,280
see it as useful for your current work
 

6669
01:54:43,280 --> 01:54:45,350
see it as useful for your current work
unconsciousness I think it will come I

6670
01:54:45,350 --> 01:54:45,360
unconsciousness I think it will come I
 

6671
01:54:45,360 --> 01:54:46,609
unconsciousness I think it will come I
have some thoughts about it but I don't

6672
01:54:46,609 --> 01:54:46,619
have some thoughts about it but I don't
 

6673
01:54:46,619 --> 01:54:47,810
have some thoughts about it but I don't
feel like they're going to move the

6674
01:54:47,810 --> 01:54:47,820
feel like they're going to move the
 

6675
01:54:47,820 --> 01:54:49,729
feel like they're going to move the
needle yet on on that but do you want to

6676
01:54:49,729 --> 01:54:49,739
needle yet on on that but do you want to
 

6677
01:54:49,739 --> 01:54:52,669
needle yet on on that but do you want to
ground in in engineering always

6678
01:54:52,669 --> 01:54:52,679
ground in in engineering always
 

6679
01:54:52,679 --> 01:54:54,169
ground in in engineering always
so well

6680
01:54:54,169 --> 01:54:54,179
so well
 

6681
01:54:54,179 --> 01:54:57,229
so well
I mean I don't so so so so if we really

6682
01:54:57,229 --> 01:54:57,239
I mean I don't so so so so if we really
 

6683
01:54:57,239 --> 01:54:59,750
I mean I don't so so so so if we really
tackle Consciousness per se in terms of

6684
01:54:59,750 --> 01:54:59,760
tackle Consciousness per se in terms of
 

6685
01:54:59,760 --> 01:55:02,090
tackle Consciousness per se in terms of
the hard problem I don't I don't that

6686
01:55:02,090 --> 01:55:02,100
the hard problem I don't I don't that
 

6687
01:55:02,100 --> 01:55:03,770
the hard problem I don't I don't that
that isn't necessarily going to be

6688
01:55:03,770 --> 01:55:03,780
that isn't necessarily going to be
 

6689
01:55:03,780 --> 01:55:05,390
that isn't necessarily going to be
groundable in engineering right that

6690
01:55:05,390 --> 01:55:05,400
groundable in engineering right that
 

6691
01:55:05,400 --> 01:55:07,430
groundable in engineering right that
that aspect of the cognition is but

6692
01:55:07,430 --> 01:55:07,440
that aspect of the cognition is but
 

6693
01:55:07,440 --> 01:55:10,070
that aspect of the cognition is but
actual Consciousness per se you know for

6694
01:55:10,070 --> 01:55:10,080
actual Consciousness per se you know for
 

6695
01:55:10,080 --> 01:55:11,810
actual Consciousness per se you know for
first person perspective I'm not sure

6696
01:55:11,810 --> 01:55:11,820
first person perspective I'm not sure
 

6697
01:55:11,820 --> 01:55:13,250
first person perspective I'm not sure
that that's groundable in engineering

6698
01:55:13,250 --> 01:55:13,260
that that's groundable in engineering
 

6699
01:55:13,260 --> 01:55:16,010
that that's groundable in engineering
and I think specifically what's

6700
01:55:16,010 --> 01:55:16,020
and I think specifically what's
 

6701
01:55:16,020 --> 01:55:17,330
and I think specifically what's
different about what's different about

6702
01:55:17,330 --> 01:55:17,340
different about what's different about
 

6703
01:55:17,340 --> 01:55:19,070
different about what's different about
it is there's a couple things so so

6704
01:55:19,070 --> 01:55:19,080
it is there's a couple things so so
 

6705
01:55:19,080 --> 01:55:20,930
it is there's a couple things so so
let's you know here we go I'll say a

6706
01:55:20,930 --> 01:55:20,940
let's you know here we go I'll say a
 

6707
01:55:20,940 --> 01:55:22,729
let's you know here we go I'll say a
couple things about about Consciousness

6708
01:55:22,729 --> 01:55:22,739
couple things about about Consciousness
 

6709
01:55:22,739 --> 01:55:25,070
couple things about about Consciousness
one one thing is that what makes it

6710
01:55:25,070 --> 01:55:25,080
one one thing is that what makes it
 

6711
01:55:25,080 --> 01:55:29,209
one one thing is that what makes it
different is that for every other type

6712
01:55:29,209 --> 01:55:29,219
different is that for every other type
 

6713
01:55:29,219 --> 01:55:31,310
different is that for every other type
aspect of science

6714
01:55:31,310 --> 01:55:31,320
aspect of science
 

6715
01:55:31,320 --> 01:55:33,709
aspect of science
when we think about having a correct or

6716
01:55:33,709 --> 01:55:33,719
when we think about having a correct or
 

6717
01:55:33,719 --> 01:55:36,770
when we think about having a correct or
a good theory of it we have some idea of

6718
01:55:36,770 --> 01:55:36,780
a good theory of it we have some idea of
 

6719
01:55:36,780 --> 01:55:38,990
a good theory of it we have some idea of
what format it that theory makes

6720
01:55:38,990 --> 01:55:39,000
what format it that theory makes
 

6721
01:55:39,000 --> 01:55:40,970
what format it that theory makes
predictions in so whether those be

6722
01:55:40,970 --> 01:55:40,980
predictions in so whether those be
 

6723
01:55:40,980 --> 01:55:43,370
predictions in so whether those be
numbers or whatever we we have some idea

6724
01:55:43,370 --> 01:55:43,380
numbers or whatever we we have some idea
 

6725
01:55:43,380 --> 01:55:44,870
numbers or whatever we we have some idea
we may not know the answer we may not

6726
01:55:44,870 --> 01:55:44,880
we may not know the answer we may not
 

6727
01:55:44,880 --> 01:55:46,490
we may not know the answer we may not
have the theory but we know that when we

6728
01:55:46,490 --> 01:55:46,500
have the theory but we know that when we
 

6729
01:55:46,500 --> 01:55:48,410
have the theory but we know that when we
get the theory here's what it's going to

6730
01:55:48,410 --> 01:55:48,420
get the theory here's what it's going to
 

6731
01:55:48,420 --> 01:55:49,729
get the theory here's what it's going to
output and then we'll know if it's right

6732
01:55:49,729 --> 01:55:49,739
output and then we'll know if it's right
 

6733
01:55:49,739 --> 01:55:52,189
output and then we'll know if it's right
or wrong for actual Consciousness not

6734
01:55:52,189 --> 01:55:52,199
or wrong for actual Consciousness not
 

6735
01:55:52,199 --> 01:55:53,870
or wrong for actual Consciousness not
Behavior not neural correlates but

6736
01:55:53,870 --> 01:55:53,880
Behavior not neural correlates but
 

6737
01:55:53,880 --> 01:55:56,750
Behavior not neural correlates but
actual first person Consciousness if we

6738
01:55:56,750 --> 01:55:56,760
actual first person Consciousness if we
 

6739
01:55:56,760 --> 01:55:58,790
actual first person Consciousness if we
had a correct Theory Of Consciousness or

6740
01:55:58,790 --> 01:55:58,800
had a correct Theory Of Consciousness or
 

6741
01:55:58,800 --> 01:56:00,890
had a correct Theory Of Consciousness or
even a good one what the hell would what

6742
01:56:00,890 --> 01:56:00,900
even a good one what the hell would what
 

6743
01:56:00,900 --> 01:56:02,629
even a good one what the hell would what
what format would would it make

6744
01:56:02,629 --> 01:56:02,639
what format would would it make
 

6745
01:56:02,639 --> 01:56:05,209
what format would would it make
predictions in right because because all

6746
01:56:05,209 --> 01:56:05,219
predictions in right because because all
 

6747
01:56:05,219 --> 01:56:06,890
predictions in right because because all
the things that we know about it

6748
01:56:06,890 --> 01:56:06,900
the things that we know about it
 

6749
01:56:06,900 --> 01:56:08,629
the things that we know about it
basically boil down to observable

6750
01:56:08,629 --> 01:56:08,639
basically boil down to observable
 

6751
01:56:08,639 --> 01:56:10,970
basically boil down to observable
behaviors so the only thing I can think

6752
01:56:10,970 --> 01:56:10,980
behaviors so the only thing I can think
 

6753
01:56:10,980 --> 01:56:14,470
behaviors so the only thing I can think
of when I think about that is is is

6754
01:56:14,470 --> 01:56:14,480
of when I think about that is is is
 

6755
01:56:14,480 --> 01:56:16,970
of when I think about that is is is
it'll be poetry or it'll be it'll be

6756
01:56:16,970 --> 01:56:16,980
it'll be poetry or it'll be it'll be
 

6757
01:56:16,980 --> 01:56:20,030
it'll be poetry or it'll be it'll be
it'll be something to um if if I ask you

6758
01:56:20,030 --> 01:56:20,040
it'll be something to um if if I ask you
 

6759
01:56:20,040 --> 01:56:21,590
it'll be something to um if if I ask you
okay you've got a great Theory Of

6760
01:56:21,590 --> 01:56:21,600
okay you've got a great Theory Of
 

6761
01:56:21,600 --> 01:56:22,910
okay you've got a great Theory Of
Consciousness and here's this here's

6762
01:56:22,910 --> 01:56:22,920
Consciousness and here's this here's
 

6763
01:56:22,920 --> 01:56:24,290
Consciousness and here's this here's
this creature maybe it's a natural maybe

6764
01:56:24,290 --> 01:56:24,300
this creature maybe it's a natural maybe
 

6765
01:56:24,300 --> 01:56:26,270
this creature maybe it's a natural maybe
it's an engineer one whatever and I want

6766
01:56:26,270 --> 01:56:26,280
it's an engineer one whatever and I want
 

6767
01:56:26,280 --> 01:56:28,370
it's an engineer one whatever and I want
you to tell me what your theory says

6768
01:56:28,370 --> 01:56:28,380
you to tell me what your theory says
 

6769
01:56:28,380 --> 01:56:31,790
you to tell me what your theory says
about this this beings um what it's like

6770
01:56:31,790 --> 01:56:31,800
about this this beings um what it's like
 

6771
01:56:31,800 --> 01:56:34,490
about this this beings um what it's like
to be this being the only thing I can

6772
01:56:34,490 --> 01:56:34,500
to be this being the only thing I can
 

6773
01:56:34,500 --> 01:56:37,010
to be this being the only thing I can
imagine you giving me is some piece of

6774
01:56:37,010 --> 01:56:37,020
imagine you giving me is some piece of
 

6775
01:56:37,020 --> 01:56:39,770
imagine you giving me is some piece of
art a poem or or something that once

6776
01:56:39,770 --> 01:56:39,780
art a poem or or something that once
 

6777
01:56:39,780 --> 01:56:43,910
art a poem or or something that once
I've taken it in I share I I I I now

6778
01:56:43,910 --> 01:56:43,920
I've taken it in I share I I I I now
 

6779
01:56:43,920 --> 01:56:46,550
I've taken it in I share I I I I now
have a similar State as whatever that's

6780
01:56:46,550 --> 01:56:46,560
have a similar State as whatever that's
 

6781
01:56:46,560 --> 01:56:47,990
have a similar State as whatever that's
that's about as good as I can come up

6782
01:56:47,990 --> 01:56:48,000
that's about as good as I can come up
 

6783
01:56:48,000 --> 01:56:51,410
that's about as good as I can come up
with well it's possible that that once

6784
01:56:51,410 --> 01:56:51,420
with well it's possible that that once
 

6785
01:56:51,420 --> 01:56:52,370
with well it's possible that that once
you have a good understanding of

6786
01:56:52,370 --> 01:56:52,380
you have a good understanding of
 

6787
01:56:52,380 --> 01:56:54,709
you have a good understanding of
Consciousness it would be mapped to some

6788
01:56:54,709 --> 01:56:54,719
Consciousness it would be mapped to some
 

6789
01:56:54,719 --> 01:56:56,990
Consciousness it would be mapped to some
things that are more measurable so for

6790
01:56:56,990 --> 01:56:57,000
things that are more measurable so for
 

6791
01:56:57,000 --> 01:57:00,350
things that are more measurable so for
example it's possible that

6792
01:57:00,350 --> 01:57:00,360
example it's possible that
 

6793
01:57:00,360 --> 01:57:03,290
example it's possible that
a conscious being is one that's able to

6794
01:57:03,290 --> 01:57:03,300
a conscious being is one that's able to
 

6795
01:57:03,300 --> 01:57:06,109
a conscious being is one that's able to
suffer

6796
01:57:06,109 --> 01:57:06,119
suffer
 

6797
01:57:06,119 --> 01:57:08,689
suffer
so you start to look at pain and

6798
01:57:08,689 --> 01:57:08,699
so you start to look at pain and
 

6799
01:57:08,699 --> 01:57:11,050
so you start to look at pain and
suffering you can start to connect it

6800
01:57:11,050 --> 01:57:11,060
suffering you can start to connect it
 

6801
01:57:11,060 --> 01:57:13,430
suffering you can start to connect it
closer to

6802
01:57:13,430 --> 01:57:13,440
closer to
 

6803
01:57:13,440 --> 01:57:15,470
closer to
things that

6804
01:57:15,470 --> 01:57:15,480
things that
 

6805
01:57:15,480 --> 01:57:19,370
things that
you can measure that in terms of how

6806
01:57:19,370 --> 01:57:19,380
you can measure that in terms of how
 

6807
01:57:19,380 --> 01:57:21,830
you can measure that in terms of how
they reflect themselves in Behavior

6808
01:57:21,830 --> 01:57:21,840
they reflect themselves in Behavior
 

6809
01:57:21,840 --> 01:57:26,510
they reflect themselves in Behavior
and problem solving and uh creation and

6810
01:57:26,510 --> 01:57:26,520
and problem solving and uh creation and
 

6811
01:57:26,520 --> 01:57:29,030
and problem solving and uh creation and
attainment of goals for example which I

6812
01:57:29,030 --> 01:57:29,040
attainment of goals for example which I
 

6813
01:57:29,040 --> 01:57:31,250
attainment of goals for example which I
think suffering is one of the you know

6814
01:57:31,250 --> 01:57:31,260
think suffering is one of the you know
 

6815
01:57:31,260 --> 01:57:34,070
think suffering is one of the you know
life is suffering it's one of the one of

6816
01:57:34,070 --> 01:57:34,080
life is suffering it's one of the one of
 

6817
01:57:34,080 --> 01:57:36,649
life is suffering it's one of the one of
the big aspects of the The Human

6818
01:57:36,649 --> 01:57:36,659
the big aspects of the The Human
 

6819
01:57:36,659 --> 01:57:38,810
the big aspects of the The Human
Condition

6820
01:57:38,810 --> 01:57:38,820
Condition
 

6821
01:57:38,820 --> 01:57:42,770
Condition
and so if Consciousness is somehow a

6822
01:57:42,770 --> 01:57:42,780
and so if Consciousness is somehow a
 

6823
01:57:42,780 --> 01:57:46,129
and so if Consciousness is somehow a
maybe at least a catalyst for suffering

6824
01:57:46,129 --> 01:57:46,139
maybe at least a catalyst for suffering
 

6825
01:57:46,139 --> 01:57:48,470
maybe at least a catalyst for suffering
you could start to get like Echoes of it

6826
01:57:48,470 --> 01:57:48,480
you could start to get like Echoes of it
 

6827
01:57:48,480 --> 01:57:50,629
you could start to get like Echoes of it
and you start you you start to see like

6828
01:57:50,629 --> 01:57:50,639
and you start you you start to see like
 

6829
01:57:50,639 --> 01:57:52,430
and you start you you start to see like
the actual effects of Consciousness and

6830
01:57:52,430 --> 01:57:52,440
the actual effects of Consciousness and
 

6831
01:57:52,440 --> 01:57:54,290
the actual effects of Consciousness and
behavior that it's not just about

6832
01:57:54,290 --> 01:57:54,300
behavior that it's not just about
 

6833
01:57:54,300 --> 01:57:56,689
behavior that it's not just about
subjective experience it's like it's

6834
01:57:56,689 --> 01:57:56,699
subjective experience it's like it's
 

6835
01:57:56,699 --> 01:57:58,910
subjective experience it's like it's
really deeply integrated in the problem

6836
01:57:58,910 --> 01:57:58,920
really deeply integrated in the problem
 

6837
01:57:58,920 --> 01:58:01,609
really deeply integrated in the problem
solving uh decision making of a system

6838
01:58:01,609 --> 01:58:01,619
solving uh decision making of a system
 

6839
01:58:01,619 --> 01:58:03,950
solving uh decision making of a system
uh something like this but also it's

6840
01:58:03,950 --> 01:58:03,960
uh something like this but also it's
 

6841
01:58:03,960 --> 01:58:07,790
uh something like this but also it's
possible that we realize this is not a

01:58:10,250 --> 01:58:10,260
philosophical statement philosophers can
 

6845
01:58:10,260 --> 01:58:13,669

write their books I welcome it uh you

6846
01:58:13,669 --> 01:58:13,679
write their books I welcome it uh you
 

6847
01:58:13,679 --> 01:58:15,890
write their books I welcome it uh you
know I I take the touring test really

6848
01:58:15,890 --> 01:58:15,900
know I I take the touring test really
 

6849
01:58:15,900 --> 01:58:17,990
know I I take the touring test really
seriously I I don't know why people

6850
01:58:17,990 --> 01:58:18,000
seriously I I don't know why people
 

6851
01:58:18,000 --> 01:58:19,970
seriously I I don't know why people
really don't like it

6852
01:58:19,970 --> 01:58:19,980
really don't like it
 

6853
01:58:19,980 --> 01:58:23,330
really don't like it
when a robot convinces you that it's

6854
01:58:23,330 --> 01:58:23,340
when a robot convinces you that it's
 

6855
01:58:23,340 --> 01:58:25,310
when a robot convinces you that it's
intelligent I think that's a really

6856
01:58:25,310 --> 01:58:25,320
intelligent I think that's a really
 

6857
01:58:25,320 --> 01:58:27,709
intelligent I think that's a really
incredible accomplishment and there's

6858
01:58:27,709 --> 01:58:27,719
incredible accomplishment and there's
 

6859
01:58:27,719 --> 01:58:29,450
incredible accomplishment and there's
some deep sense in which that is

6860
01:58:29,450 --> 01:58:29,460
some deep sense in which that is
 

6861
01:58:29,460 --> 01:58:30,770
some deep sense in which that is
intelligence

6862
01:58:30,770 --> 01:58:30,780
intelligence
 

6863
01:58:30,780 --> 01:58:33,169
intelligence
if it looks like it's intelligent it is

6864
01:58:33,169 --> 01:58:33,179
if it looks like it's intelligent it is
 

6865
01:58:33,179 --> 01:58:36,410
if it looks like it's intelligent it is
intelligent and I think there's some

6866
01:58:36,410 --> 01:58:36,420
intelligent and I think there's some
 

6867
01:58:36,420 --> 01:58:38,870
intelligent and I think there's some
deep aspect

6868
01:58:38,870 --> 01:58:38,880
deep aspect
 

6869
01:58:38,880 --> 01:58:40,310
deep aspect
of

6870
01:58:40,310 --> 01:58:40,320
of
 

6871
01:58:40,320 --> 01:58:42,649
of
um a system that appears to be conscious

6872
01:58:42,649 --> 01:58:42,659
um a system that appears to be conscious
 

6873
01:58:42,659 --> 01:58:44,390
um a system that appears to be conscious
it

6874
01:58:44,390 --> 01:58:44,400
it
 

6875
01:58:44,400 --> 01:58:47,470
it
in some deep sense it is conscious

6876
01:58:47,470 --> 01:58:47,480
in some deep sense it is conscious
 

6877
01:58:47,480 --> 01:58:50,450
in some deep sense it is conscious
for these for me we have to consider

6878
01:58:50,450 --> 01:58:50,460
for these for me we have to consider
 

6879
01:58:50,460 --> 01:58:53,629
for these for me we have to consider
that possibility and a system that

6880
01:58:53,629 --> 01:58:53,639
that possibility and a system that
 

6881
01:58:53,639 --> 01:58:55,790
that possibility and a system that
appears to be conscious

6882
01:58:55,790 --> 01:58:55,800
appears to be conscious
 

6883
01:58:55,800 --> 01:58:58,550
appears to be conscious
is an engineering challenge

6884
01:58:58,550 --> 01:58:58,560
is an engineering challenge
 

6885
01:58:58,560 --> 01:59:00,950
is an engineering challenge
yeah I don't disagree with any of that I

6886
01:59:00,950 --> 01:59:00,960
yeah I don't disagree with any of that I
 

6887
01:59:00,960 --> 01:59:02,629
yeah I don't disagree with any of that I
mean especially intelligence I think is

6888
01:59:02,629 --> 01:59:02,639
mean especially intelligence I think is
 

6889
01:59:02,639 --> 01:59:06,530
mean especially intelligence I think is
a publicly observable thing I I and and

6890
01:59:06,530 --> 01:59:06,540
a publicly observable thing I I and and
 

6891
01:59:06,540 --> 01:59:08,330
a publicly observable thing I I and and
I mean you know science fiction has

6892
01:59:08,330 --> 01:59:08,340
I mean you know science fiction has
 

6893
01:59:08,340 --> 01:59:11,149
I mean you know science fiction has
dealt with this for a century or or much

6894
01:59:11,149 --> 01:59:11,159
dealt with this for a century or or much
 

6895
01:59:11,159 --> 01:59:13,550
dealt with this for a century or or much
more maybe uh this idea that when you

6896
01:59:13,550 --> 01:59:13,560
more maybe uh this idea that when you
 

6897
01:59:13,560 --> 01:59:16,189
more maybe uh this idea that when you
are confronted with something that just

6898
01:59:16,189 --> 01:59:16,199
are confronted with something that just
 

6899
01:59:16,199 --> 01:59:17,450
are confronted with something that just
doesn't meet any of your typical

6900
01:59:17,450 --> 01:59:17,460
doesn't meet any of your typical
 

6901
01:59:17,460 --> 01:59:19,910
doesn't meet any of your typical
assumptions so you can't look in the

6902
01:59:19,910 --> 01:59:19,920
assumptions so you can't look in the
 

6903
01:59:19,920 --> 01:59:21,290
assumptions so you can't look in the
skull and say oh well there's that

6904
01:59:21,290 --> 01:59:21,300
skull and say oh well there's that
 

6905
01:59:21,300 --> 01:59:22,790
skull and say oh well there's that
frontal cortex so then I guess we're

6906
01:59:22,790 --> 01:59:22,800
frontal cortex so then I guess we're
 

6907
01:59:22,800 --> 01:59:24,649
frontal cortex so then I guess we're
good right if it's if it's you know so

6908
01:59:24,649 --> 01:59:24,659
good right if it's if it's you know so
 

6909
01:59:24,659 --> 01:59:26,390
good right if it's if it's you know so
so this thing lands on your front lawn

6910
01:59:26,390 --> 01:59:26,400
so this thing lands on your front lawn
 

6911
01:59:26,400 --> 01:59:27,830
so this thing lands on your front lawn
and this you know with the the little

6912
01:59:27,830 --> 01:59:27,840
and this you know with the the little
 

6913
01:59:27,840 --> 01:59:29,270
and this you know with the the little
door opens and something trundles out

6914
01:59:29,270 --> 01:59:29,280
door opens and something trundles out
 

6915
01:59:29,280 --> 01:59:30,950
door opens and something trundles out
and it's sort of like

6916
01:59:30,950 --> 01:59:30,960
and it's sort of like
 

6917
01:59:30,960 --> 01:59:32,870
and it's sort of like
um you know kind of shiny and aluminum

6918
01:59:32,870 --> 01:59:32,880
um you know kind of shiny and aluminum
 

6919
01:59:32,880 --> 01:59:34,729
um you know kind of shiny and aluminum
looking and it hands you this uh you

6920
01:59:34,729 --> 01:59:34,739
looking and it hands you this uh you
 

6921
01:59:34,739 --> 01:59:35,930
looking and it hands you this uh you
know it hands you this poem that it

6922
01:59:35,930 --> 01:59:35,940
know it hands you this poem that it
 

6923
01:59:35,940 --> 01:59:37,550
know it hands you this poem that it
wrote while it was on you know flying

6924
01:59:37,550 --> 01:59:37,560
wrote while it was on you know flying
 

6925
01:59:37,560 --> 01:59:39,169
wrote while it was on you know flying
over and how happy it is to meet you

6926
01:59:39,169 --> 01:59:39,179
over and how happy it is to meet you
 

6927
01:59:39,179 --> 01:59:41,390
over and how happy it is to meet you
like what's going to be your criteria

6928
01:59:41,390 --> 01:59:41,400
like what's going to be your criteria
 

6929
01:59:41,400 --> 01:59:42,830
like what's going to be your criteria
right for whether whether you get to

6930
01:59:42,830 --> 01:59:42,840
right for whether whether you get to
 

6931
01:59:42,840 --> 01:59:44,390
right for whether whether you get to
take it apart and see what makes a tick

6932
01:59:44,390 --> 01:59:44,400
take it apart and see what makes a tick
 

6933
01:59:44,400 --> 01:59:45,830
take it apart and see what makes a tick
or whether you have to you know be nice

6934
01:59:45,830 --> 01:59:45,840
or whether you have to you know be nice
 

6935
01:59:45,840 --> 01:59:47,810
or whether you have to you know be nice
to it and and whatever right like all

6936
01:59:47,810 --> 01:59:47,820
to it and and whatever right like all
 

6937
01:59:47,820 --> 01:59:49,450
to it and and whatever right like all
the all the criteria that we have now

6938
01:59:49,450 --> 01:59:49,460
the all the criteria that we have now
 

6939
01:59:49,460 --> 01:59:52,370
the all the criteria that we have now
and you know that people are using and

6940
01:59:52,370 --> 01:59:52,380
and you know that people are using and
 

6941
01:59:52,380 --> 01:59:53,870
and you know that people are using and
as you said a lot of people are down on

6942
01:59:53,870 --> 01:59:53,880
as you said a lot of people are down on
 

6943
01:59:53,880 --> 01:59:55,010
as you said a lot of people are down on
the touring tests and things like this

6944
01:59:55,010 --> 01:59:55,020
the touring tests and things like this
 

6945
01:59:55,020 --> 01:59:56,810
the touring tests and things like this
but but what else have we got you know

6946
01:59:56,810 --> 01:59:56,820
but but what else have we got you know
 

6947
01:59:56,820 --> 01:59:58,490
but but what else have we got you know
because measuring measuring a quart

6948
01:59:58,490 --> 01:59:58,500
because measuring measuring a quart
 

6949
01:59:58,500 --> 02:00:00,410
because measuring measuring a quart
excise isn't gonna isn't gonna cut it

6950
02:00:00,410 --> 02:00:00,420
excise isn't gonna isn't gonna cut it
 

6951
02:00:00,420 --> 02:00:02,750
excise isn't gonna isn't gonna cut it
right in the broader scheme of things so

6952
02:00:02,750 --> 02:00:02,760
right in the broader scheme of things so
 

6953
02:00:02,760 --> 02:00:05,510
right in the broader scheme of things so
uh I think this is it's it's a wide open

6954
02:00:05,510 --> 02:00:05,520
uh I think this is it's it's a wide open
 

6955
02:00:05,520 --> 02:00:07,790
uh I think this is it's it's a wide open
it's a wide open problem that right that

6956
02:00:07,790 --> 02:00:07,800
it's a wide open problem that right that
 

6957
02:00:07,800 --> 02:00:09,890
it's a wide open problem that right that
we you know our our solution to the

6958
02:00:09,890 --> 02:00:09,900
we you know our our solution to the
 

6959
02:00:09,900 --> 02:00:11,689
we you know our our solution to the
problem of other Minds it's very

6960
02:00:11,689 --> 02:00:11,699
problem of other Minds it's very
 

6961
02:00:11,699 --> 02:00:13,609
problem of other Minds it's very
simplistic right we we give each other

6962
02:00:13,609 --> 02:00:13,619
simplistic right we we give each other
 

6963
02:00:13,619 --> 02:00:15,410
simplistic right we we give each other
credit for having Minds just because we

6964
02:00:15,410 --> 02:00:15,420
credit for having Minds just because we
 

6965
02:00:15,420 --> 02:00:17,209
credit for having Minds just because we
sort of on uh you know on an anatomical

6966
02:00:17,209 --> 02:00:17,219
sort of on uh you know on an anatomical
 

6967
02:00:17,219 --> 02:00:18,770
sort of on uh you know on an anatomical
level we're pretty similar and then so

6968
02:00:18,770 --> 02:00:18,780
level we're pretty similar and then so
 

6969
02:00:18,780 --> 02:00:20,629
level we're pretty similar and then so
that's good enough but how how far is

6970
02:00:20,629 --> 02:00:20,639
that's good enough but how how far is
 

6971
02:00:20,639 --> 02:00:22,550
that's good enough but how how far is
that going to go so I think that's

6972
02:00:22,550 --> 02:00:22,560
that going to go so I think that's
 

6973
02:00:22,560 --> 02:00:24,709
that going to go so I think that's
really primitive so um yeah I think I

6974
02:00:24,709 --> 02:00:24,719
really primitive so um yeah I think I
 

6975
02:00:24,719 --> 02:00:26,570
really primitive so um yeah I think I
think it's a major unsolved problem it's

6976
02:00:26,570 --> 02:00:26,580
think it's a major unsolved problem it's
 

6977
02:00:26,580 --> 02:00:28,629
think it's a major unsolved problem it's
a really challenging

6978
02:00:28,629 --> 02:00:28,639
a really challenging
 

6979
02:00:28,639 --> 02:00:31,910
a really challenging
uh direction of thought to the human

6980
02:00:31,910 --> 02:00:31,920
uh direction of thought to the human
 

6981
02:00:31,920 --> 02:00:32,990
uh direction of thought to the human
race

6982
02:00:32,990 --> 02:00:33,000
race
 

6983
02:00:33,000 --> 02:00:35,450
race
uh that you talked about like embodied

6984
02:00:35,450 --> 02:00:35,460
uh that you talked about like embodied
 

6985
02:00:35,460 --> 02:00:38,810
uh that you talked about like embodied
Minds if you start to think that other

6986
02:00:38,810 --> 02:00:38,820
Minds if you start to think that other
 

6987
02:00:38,820 --> 02:00:41,629
Minds if you start to think that other
things other than humans have Minds

6988
02:00:41,629 --> 02:00:41,639
things other than humans have Minds
 

6989
02:00:41,639 --> 02:00:44,270
things other than humans have Minds
that's really challenging yeah because

6990
02:00:44,270 --> 02:00:44,280
that's really challenging yeah because
 

6991
02:00:44,280 --> 02:00:47,270
that's really challenging yeah because
all men are created equal starts

6992
02:00:47,270 --> 02:00:47,280
all men are created equal starts
 

6993
02:00:47,280 --> 02:00:49,669
all men are created equal starts
starts being like all right well we

6994
02:00:49,669 --> 02:00:49,679
starts being like all right well we
 

6995
02:00:49,679 --> 02:00:52,070
starts being like all right well we
should probably treat

6996
02:00:52,070 --> 02:00:52,080
should probably treat
 

6997
02:00:52,080 --> 02:00:55,790
should probably treat
not just cows with respect yeah but like

6998
02:00:55,790 --> 02:00:55,800
not just cows with respect yeah but like
 

6999
02:00:55,800 --> 02:01:00,070
not just cows with respect yeah but like
plants and not just plants but

7000
02:01:00,070 --> 02:01:00,080
plants and not just plants but
 

7001
02:01:00,080 --> 02:01:03,530
plants and not just plants but
uh some kind of organized conglomerates

7002
02:01:03,530 --> 02:01:03,540
uh some kind of organized conglomerates
 

7003
02:01:03,540 --> 02:01:05,990
uh some kind of organized conglomerates
of cells in a petri dish

7004
02:01:05,990 --> 02:01:06,000
of cells in a petri dish
 

7005
02:01:06,000 --> 02:01:08,330
of cells in a petri dish
in fact some of the work we're we're

7006
02:01:08,330 --> 02:01:08,340
in fact some of the work we're we're
 

7007
02:01:08,340 --> 02:01:10,790
in fact some of the work we're we're
doing like you're doing and the whole

7008
02:01:10,790 --> 02:01:10,800
doing like you're doing and the whole
 

7009
02:01:10,800 --> 02:01:12,050
doing like you're doing and the whole
community of science is doing with

7010
02:01:12,050 --> 02:01:12,060
community of science is doing with
 

7011
02:01:12,060 --> 02:01:14,629
community of science is doing with
Biology people might be like we weren't

7012
02:01:14,629 --> 02:01:14,639
Biology people might be like we weren't
 

7013
02:01:14,639 --> 02:01:17,270
Biology people might be like we weren't
really mean to viruses yeah

7014
02:01:17,270 --> 02:01:17,280
really mean to viruses yeah
 

7015
02:01:17,280 --> 02:01:19,729
really mean to viruses yeah
I mean yeah I the thing is you're right

7016
02:01:19,729 --> 02:01:19,739
I mean yeah I the thing is you're right
 

7017
02:01:19,739 --> 02:01:21,530
I mean yeah I the thing is you're right
and and I get I get I certainly get

7018
02:01:21,530 --> 02:01:21,540
and and I get I get I certainly get
 

7019
02:01:21,540 --> 02:01:23,149
and and I get I get I certainly get
phone calls about uh people complaining

7020
02:01:23,149 --> 02:01:23,159
phone calls about uh people complaining
 

7021
02:01:23,159 --> 02:01:25,790
phone calls about uh people complaining
about frog skin and so on but

7022
02:01:25,790 --> 02:01:25,800
about frog skin and so on but
 

7023
02:01:25,800 --> 02:01:28,490
about frog skin and so on but
I think we have to separate the sort of

7024
02:01:28,490 --> 02:01:28,500
I think we have to separate the sort of
 

7025
02:01:28,500 --> 02:01:30,530
I think we have to separate the sort of
deep philosophical aspects versus what

7026
02:01:30,530 --> 02:01:30,540
deep philosophical aspects versus what
 

7027
02:01:30,540 --> 02:01:31,669
deep philosophical aspects versus what
actually happened so what actually

7028
02:01:31,669 --> 02:01:31,679
actually happened so what actually
 

7029
02:01:31,679 --> 02:01:34,310
actually happened so what actually
happens on Earth is that people with

7030
02:01:34,310 --> 02:01:34,320
happens on Earth is that people with
 

7031
02:01:34,320 --> 02:01:36,350
happens on Earth is that people with
exactly the same anatomical structure

7032
02:01:36,350 --> 02:01:36,360
exactly the same anatomical structure
 

7033
02:01:36,360 --> 02:01:38,810
exactly the same anatomical structure
kill each other you know on a daily

7034
02:01:38,810 --> 02:01:38,820
kill each other you know on a daily
 

7035
02:01:38,820 --> 02:01:42,169
kill each other you know on a daily
basis right so so so it I think it's

7036
02:01:42,169 --> 02:01:42,179
basis right so so so it I think it's
 

7037
02:01:42,179 --> 02:01:44,270
basis right so so so it I think it's
clear that simply knowing that something

7038
02:01:44,270 --> 02:01:44,280
clear that simply knowing that something
 

7039
02:01:44,280 --> 02:01:47,030
clear that simply knowing that something
else is equally or maybe more uh

7040
02:01:47,030 --> 02:01:47,040
else is equally or maybe more uh
 

7041
02:01:47,040 --> 02:01:49,250
else is equally or maybe more uh
cognitive or conscious than you are is

7042
02:01:49,250 --> 02:01:49,260
cognitive or conscious than you are is
 

7043
02:01:49,260 --> 02:01:51,530
cognitive or conscious than you are is
is not a guarantee of of of kind

7044
02:01:51,530 --> 02:01:51,540
is not a guarantee of of of kind
 

7045
02:01:51,540 --> 02:01:53,689
is not a guarantee of of of kind
behavior that that much we know of so

7046
02:01:53,689 --> 02:01:53,699
behavior that that much we know of so
 

7047
02:01:53,699 --> 02:01:55,850
behavior that that much we know of so
then and so then then we look at a

7048
02:01:55,850 --> 02:01:55,860
then and so then then we look at a
 

7049
02:01:55,860 --> 02:01:57,530
then and so then then we look at a
commercial farming of mammals and

7050
02:01:57,530 --> 02:01:57,540
commercial farming of mammals and
 

7051
02:01:57,540 --> 02:01:59,149
commercial farming of mammals and
various other things and so so I think

7052
02:01:59,149 --> 02:01:59,159
various other things and so so I think
 

7053
02:01:59,159 --> 02:02:02,149
various other things and so so I think
on a practical basis long before we get

7054
02:02:02,149 --> 02:02:02,159
on a practical basis long before we get
 

7055
02:02:02,159 --> 02:02:03,770
on a practical basis long before we get
to worrying about

7056
02:02:03,770 --> 02:02:03,780
to worrying about
 

7057
02:02:03,780 --> 02:02:06,649
to worrying about
um things like frog skin we have to ask

7058
02:02:06,649 --> 02:02:06,659
um things like frog skin we have to ask
 

7059
02:02:06,659 --> 02:02:09,350
um things like frog skin we have to ask
ourselves why are we uh what what can we

7060
02:02:09,350 --> 02:02:09,360
ourselves why are we uh what what can we
 

7061
02:02:09,360 --> 02:02:10,490
ourselves why are we uh what what can we
do about the way that we've been

7062
02:02:10,490 --> 02:02:10,500
do about the way that we've been
 

7063
02:02:10,500 --> 02:02:12,229
do about the way that we've been
behaving with the towards creatures

7064
02:02:12,229 --> 02:02:12,239
behaving with the towards creatures
 

7065
02:02:12,239 --> 02:02:14,089
behaving with the towards creatures
which we know for a factor because of

7066
02:02:14,089 --> 02:02:14,099
which we know for a factor because of
 

7067
02:02:14,099 --> 02:02:16,189
which we know for a factor because of
our similarities are are basically just

7068
02:02:16,189 --> 02:02:16,199
our similarities are are basically just
 

7069
02:02:16,199 --> 02:02:17,870
our similarities are are basically just
like us you know that's kind of a whole

7070
02:02:17,870 --> 02:02:17,880
like us you know that's kind of a whole
 

7071
02:02:17,880 --> 02:02:19,669
like us you know that's kind of a whole
other this is a social thing but but but

7072
02:02:19,669 --> 02:02:19,679
other this is a social thing but but but
 

7073
02:02:19,679 --> 02:02:21,890
other this is a social thing but but but
fundamentally you know of course you're

7074
02:02:21,890 --> 02:02:21,900
fundamentally you know of course you're
 

7075
02:02:21,900 --> 02:02:24,950
fundamentally you know of course you're
absolutely right in that we we are also

7076
02:02:24,950 --> 02:02:24,960
absolutely right in that we we are also
 

7077
02:02:24,960 --> 02:02:26,270
absolutely right in that we we are also
thinking about this we are on this

7078
02:02:26,270 --> 02:02:26,280
thinking about this we are on this
 

7079
02:02:26,280 --> 02:02:29,209
thinking about this we are on this
planet in some way incredibly lucky it's

7080
02:02:29,209 --> 02:02:29,219
planet in some way incredibly lucky it's
 

7081
02:02:29,219 --> 02:02:32,030
planet in some way incredibly lucky it's
just dumb luck that we really only have

7082
02:02:32,030 --> 02:02:32,040
just dumb luck that we really only have
 

7083
02:02:32,040 --> 02:02:35,089
just dumb luck that we really only have
one dominant species it didn't have to

7084
02:02:35,089 --> 02:02:35,099
one dominant species it didn't have to
 

7085
02:02:35,099 --> 02:02:36,950
one dominant species it didn't have to
work out that way so you could easily

7086
02:02:36,950 --> 02:02:36,960
work out that way so you could easily
 

7087
02:02:36,960 --> 02:02:38,390
work out that way so you could easily
imagine that there could be a planet

7088
02:02:38,390 --> 02:02:38,400
imagine that there could be a planet
 

7089
02:02:38,400 --> 02:02:41,930
imagine that there could be a planet
somewhere with more than one equally or

7090
02:02:41,930 --> 02:02:41,940
somewhere with more than one equally or
 

7091
02:02:41,940 --> 02:02:44,089
somewhere with more than one equally or
maybe near equally intelligent species

7092
02:02:44,089 --> 02:02:44,099
maybe near equally intelligent species
 

7093
02:02:44,099 --> 02:02:47,209
maybe near equally intelligent species
and then uh but but then they may not

7094
02:02:47,209 --> 02:02:47,219
and then uh but but then they may not
 

7095
02:02:47,219 --> 02:02:48,589
and then uh but but then they may not
look anything like each other right so

7096
02:02:48,589 --> 02:02:48,599
look anything like each other right so
 

7097
02:02:48,599 --> 02:02:50,149
look anything like each other right so
there may be multiple ecosystems where

7098
02:02:50,149 --> 02:02:50,159
there may be multiple ecosystems where
 

7099
02:02:50,159 --> 02:02:53,390
there may be multiple ecosystems where
there are uh things of of similar to

7100
02:02:53,390 --> 02:02:53,400
there are uh things of of similar to
 

7101
02:02:53,400 --> 02:02:54,950
there are uh things of of similar to
human-like intelligence and then you'd

7102
02:02:54,950 --> 02:02:54,960
human-like intelligence and then you'd
 

7103
02:02:54,960 --> 02:02:57,410
human-like intelligence and then you'd
have all kinds of issues about you know

7104
02:02:57,410 --> 02:02:57,420
have all kinds of issues about you know
 

7105
02:02:57,420 --> 02:02:58,850
have all kinds of issues about you know
how do you how do you relate to them

7106
02:02:58,850 --> 02:02:58,860
how do you how do you relate to them
 

7107
02:02:58,860 --> 02:03:00,410
how do you how do you relate to them
when they're physically not like you at

7108
02:03:00,410 --> 02:03:00,420
when they're physically not like you at
 

7109
02:03:00,420 --> 02:03:02,689
when they're physically not like you at
all but yet yet you know in terms of

7110
02:03:02,689 --> 02:03:02,699
all but yet yet you know in terms of
 

7111
02:03:02,699 --> 02:03:04,189
all but yet yet you know in terms of
behavior and culture and whatever it's

7112
02:03:04,189 --> 02:03:04,199
behavior and culture and whatever it's
 

7113
02:03:04,199 --> 02:03:06,229
behavior and culture and whatever it's
pretty obvious that they've got as you

7114
02:03:06,229 --> 02:03:06,239
pretty obvious that they've got as you
 

7115
02:03:06,239 --> 02:03:07,910
pretty obvious that they've got as you
know as much on the ball as you have or

7116
02:03:07,910 --> 02:03:07,920
know as much on the ball as you have or
 

7117
02:03:07,920 --> 02:03:09,470
know as much on the ball as you have or
maybe imagine imagine that there was

7118
02:03:09,470 --> 02:03:09,480
maybe imagine imagine that there was
 

7119
02:03:09,480 --> 02:03:10,490
maybe imagine imagine that there was
another

7120
02:03:10,490 --> 02:03:10,500
another
 

7121
02:03:10,500 --> 02:03:12,530
another
um group of beings that was like on

7122
02:03:12,530 --> 02:03:12,540
um group of beings that was like on
 

7123
02:03:12,540 --> 02:03:14,629
um group of beings that was like on
average you know 40 IQ points lower

7124
02:03:14,629 --> 02:03:14,639
average you know 40 IQ points lower
 

7125
02:03:14,639 --> 02:03:16,370
average you know 40 IQ points lower
right like like we're just we're pretty

7126
02:03:16,370 --> 02:03:16,380
right like like we're just we're pretty
 

7127
02:03:16,380 --> 02:03:18,530
right like like we're just we're pretty
lucky in many ways we you know we don't

7128
02:03:18,530 --> 02:03:18,540
lucky in many ways we you know we don't
 

7129
02:03:18,540 --> 02:03:20,089
lucky in many ways we you know we don't
really have even though we we sort of

7130
02:03:20,089 --> 02:03:20,099
really have even though we we sort of
 

7131
02:03:20,099 --> 02:03:21,709
really have even though we we sort of
you know we still act badly in many ways

7132
02:03:21,709 --> 02:03:21,719
you know we still act badly in many ways
 

7133
02:03:21,719 --> 02:03:23,990
you know we still act badly in many ways
but but but the fact is you know all

7134
02:03:23,990 --> 02:03:24,000
but but but the fact is you know all
 

7135
02:03:24,000 --> 02:03:25,850
but but but the fact is you know all
humans are more or less in this like in

7136
02:03:25,850 --> 02:03:25,860
humans are more or less in this like in
 

7137
02:03:25,860 --> 02:03:27,589
humans are more or less in this like in
the same that same range but didn't have

7138
02:03:27,589 --> 02:03:27,599
the same that same range but didn't have
 

7139
02:03:27,599 --> 02:03:29,629
the same that same range but didn't have
to work out that way well but I think

7140
02:03:29,629 --> 02:03:29,639
to work out that way well but I think
 

7141
02:03:29,639 --> 02:03:32,570
to work out that way well but I think
that's part of the way life works on

7142
02:03:32,570 --> 02:03:32,580
that's part of the way life works on
 

7143
02:03:32,580 --> 02:03:36,470
that's part of the way life works on
Earth maybe human civilization works

7144
02:03:36,470 --> 02:03:36,480
Earth maybe human civilization works
 

7145
02:03:36,480 --> 02:03:39,649
Earth maybe human civilization works
is it seems like we want us ourselves to

7146
02:03:39,649 --> 02:03:39,659
is it seems like we want us ourselves to
 

7147
02:03:39,659 --> 02:03:41,870
is it seems like we want us ourselves to
be quite similar

7148
02:03:41,870 --> 02:03:41,880
be quite similar
 

7149
02:03:41,880 --> 02:03:44,330
be quite similar
and then within that you know what

7150
02:03:44,330 --> 02:03:44,340
and then within that you know what
 

7151
02:03:44,340 --> 02:03:46,370
and then within that you know what
everybody's about the same relatively IQ

7152
02:03:46,370 --> 02:03:46,380
everybody's about the same relatively IQ
 

7153
02:03:46,380 --> 02:03:47,750
everybody's about the same relatively IQ
intelligence problem solving

7154
02:03:47,750 --> 02:03:47,760

7155
02:03:47,760 --> 02:03:49,070

capabilities even physical

7156
02:03:49,070 --> 02:03:49,080

characteristics
 

7159
02:03:50,880 --> 02:03:54,410
characteristics
but then we'll find some aspect of that

7160
02:03:54,410 --> 02:03:54,420
but then we'll find some aspect of that
 

7161
02:03:54,420 --> 02:03:59,629
but then we'll find some aspect of that
as different and that seems to be like

7162
02:03:59,629 --> 02:03:59,639
as different and that seems to be like
 

7163
02:03:59,639 --> 02:04:02,870
as different and that seems to be like
I mean it's it's really dark to say but

7164
02:04:02,870 --> 02:04:02,880
I mean it's it's really dark to say but
 

7165
02:04:02,880 --> 02:04:04,910
I mean it's it's really dark to say but
there seems to be the

7166
02:04:04,910 --> 02:04:04,920
there seems to be the
 

7167
02:04:04,920 --> 02:04:10,010
there seems to be the
I'm not even a bug but like a feature of

7168
02:04:10,010 --> 02:04:10,020
I'm not even a bug but like a feature of
 

7169
02:04:10,020 --> 02:04:11,810
I'm not even a bug but like a feature of
the early development of human

7170
02:04:11,810 --> 02:04:11,820
the early development of human
 

7171
02:04:11,820 --> 02:04:14,990
the early development of human
civilization you pick the other your

7172
02:04:14,990 --> 02:04:15,000
civilization you pick the other your
 

7173
02:04:15,000 --> 02:04:17,149
civilization you pick the other your
tribe versus the other tribe in your War

7174
02:04:17,149 --> 02:04:17,159
tribe versus the other tribe in your War
 

7175
02:04:17,159 --> 02:04:19,970
tribe versus the other tribe in your War
it's a kind of evolution evolution in

7176
02:04:19,970 --> 02:04:19,980
it's a kind of evolution evolution in
 

7177
02:04:19,980 --> 02:04:23,450
it's a kind of evolution evolution in
the space of of memes a space of ideas I

7178
02:04:23,450 --> 02:04:23,460
the space of of memes a space of ideas I
 

7179
02:04:23,460 --> 02:04:26,689
the space of of memes a space of ideas I
think a new war with each other so we're

7180
02:04:26,689 --> 02:04:26,699
think a new war with each other so we're
 

7181
02:04:26,699 --> 02:04:28,729
think a new war with each other so we're
very good at finding the other even when

7182
02:04:28,729 --> 02:04:28,739
very good at finding the other even when
 

7183
02:04:28,739 --> 02:04:30,229
very good at finding the other even when
the characteristics are really the same

7184
02:04:30,229 --> 02:04:30,239
the characteristics are really the same
 

7185
02:04:30,239 --> 02:04:32,629
the characteristics are really the same
that's I don't know what

7186
02:04:32,629 --> 02:04:32,639
that's I don't know what
 

7187
02:04:32,639 --> 02:04:36,109
that's I don't know what
that I mean I'm sure so many of these

7188
02:04:36,109 --> 02:04:36,119
that I mean I'm sure so many of these
 

7189
02:04:36,119 --> 02:04:38,209
that I mean I'm sure so many of these
things echo in the biological World in

7190
02:04:38,209 --> 02:04:38,219
things echo in the biological World in
 

7191
02:04:38,219 --> 02:04:40,370
things echo in the biological World in
some way yeah there's a fun um

7192
02:04:40,370 --> 02:04:40,380
some way yeah there's a fun um
 

7193
02:04:40,380 --> 02:04:42,830
some way yeah there's a fun um
experiment that uh I did my my son

7194
02:04:42,830 --> 02:04:42,840
experiment that uh I did my my son
 

7195
02:04:42,840 --> 02:04:44,629
experiment that uh I did my my son
actually came up with this so we we did

7196
02:04:44,629 --> 02:04:44,639
actually came up with this so we we did
 

7197
02:04:44,639 --> 02:04:47,149
actually came up with this so we we did
um a a biology unit together he would

7198
02:04:47,149 --> 02:04:47,159
um a a biology unit together he would
 

7199
02:04:47,159 --> 02:04:48,649
um a a biology unit together he would
use so homeschool and so we did this a

7200
02:04:48,649 --> 02:04:48,659
use so homeschool and so we did this a
 

7201
02:04:48,659 --> 02:04:50,149
use so homeschool and so we did this a
couple years ago we did this thing where

7202
02:04:50,149 --> 02:04:50,159
couple years ago we did this thing where
 

7203
02:04:50,159 --> 02:04:52,129
couple years ago we did this thing where
it imagines you get the sly mold right

7204
02:04:52,129 --> 02:04:52,139
it imagines you get the sly mold right
 

7205
02:04:52,139 --> 02:04:55,070
it imagines you get the sly mold right
and polycephalum and it grows on them uh

7206
02:04:55,070 --> 02:04:55,080
and polycephalum and it grows on them uh
 

7207
02:04:55,080 --> 02:04:57,109
and polycephalum and it grows on them uh
on a uh on a petri dish of agar and it

7208
02:04:57,109 --> 02:04:57,119
on a uh on a petri dish of agar and it
 

7209
02:04:57,119 --> 02:04:58,729
on a uh on a petri dish of agar and it
sort of spreads out and and it's it's

7210
02:04:58,729 --> 02:04:58,739
sort of spreads out and and it's it's
 

7211
02:04:58,739 --> 02:05:00,950
sort of spreads out and and it's it's
it's a single cell you know produce but

7212
02:05:00,950 --> 02:05:00,960
it's a single cell you know produce but
 

7213
02:05:00,960 --> 02:05:02,629
it's a single cell you know produce but
it's like this giant thing and so you

7214
02:05:02,629 --> 02:05:02,639
it's like this giant thing and so you
 

7215
02:05:02,639 --> 02:05:04,070
it's like this giant thing and so you
put down a piece of oat and it wants to

7216
02:05:04,070 --> 02:05:04,080
put down a piece of oat and it wants to
 

7217
02:05:04,080 --> 02:05:05,450
put down a piece of oat and it wants to
go get the oat and it sort of grows

7218
02:05:05,450 --> 02:05:05,460
go get the oat and it sort of grows
 

7219
02:05:05,460 --> 02:05:07,010
go get the oat and it sort of grows
towards the oat so what you do is you

7220
02:05:07,010 --> 02:05:07,020
towards the oat so what you do is you
 

7221
02:05:07,020 --> 02:05:09,169
towards the oat so what you do is you
take a razor blade and you just you just

7222
02:05:09,169 --> 02:05:09,179
take a razor blade and you just you just
 

7223
02:05:09,179 --> 02:05:10,790
take a razor blade and you just you just
separate the piece of the whole culture

7224
02:05:10,790 --> 02:05:10,800
separate the piece of the whole culture
 

7225
02:05:10,800 --> 02:05:12,589
separate the piece of the whole culture
that's growing towards the the oh you

7226
02:05:12,589 --> 02:05:12,599
that's growing towards the the oh you
 

7227
02:05:12,599 --> 02:05:14,450
that's growing towards the the oh you
just kind of separate it and so now

7228
02:05:14,450 --> 02:05:14,460
just kind of separate it and so now
 

7229
02:05:14,460 --> 02:05:16,490
just kind of separate it and so now
think about think about the interesting

7230
02:05:16,490 --> 02:05:16,500
think about think about the interesting
 

7231
02:05:16,500 --> 02:05:18,109
think about think about the interesting
decision-making calculus for that little

7232
02:05:18,109 --> 02:05:18,119
decision-making calculus for that little
 

7233
02:05:18,119 --> 02:05:21,770
decision-making calculus for that little
piece I can I can go get the oat and

7234
02:05:21,770 --> 02:05:21,780
piece I can I can go get the oat and
 

7235
02:05:21,780 --> 02:05:23,149
piece I can I can go get the oat and
therefore I won't have to share those

7236
02:05:23,149 --> 02:05:23,159
therefore I won't have to share those
 

7237
02:05:23,159 --> 02:05:24,649
therefore I won't have to share those
nutrients with this giant mass over

7238
02:05:24,649 --> 02:05:24,659
nutrients with this giant mass over
 

7239
02:05:24,659 --> 02:05:26,330
nutrients with this giant mass over
there so the so the nutrients per unit

7240
02:05:26,330 --> 02:05:26,340
there so the so the nutrients per unit
 

7241
02:05:26,340 --> 02:05:27,709
there so the so the nutrients per unit
volume is going to be amazing so I

7242
02:05:27,709 --> 02:05:27,719
volume is going to be amazing so I
 

7243
02:05:27,719 --> 02:05:28,970
volume is going to be amazing so I
should go ethio

7244
02:05:28,970 --> 02:05:28,980
should go ethio
 

7245
02:05:28,980 --> 02:05:31,729
should go ethio
but if I first rejoin because faizaram

7246
02:05:31,729 --> 02:05:31,739
but if I first rejoin because faizaram
 

7247
02:05:31,739 --> 02:05:33,109
but if I first rejoin because faizaram
once you cut it has the ability to join

7248
02:05:33,109 --> 02:05:33,119
once you cut it has the ability to join
 

7249
02:05:33,119 --> 02:05:36,470
once you cut it has the ability to join
back up if I first rejoin then that

7250
02:05:36,470 --> 02:05:36,480
back up if I first rejoin then that
 

7251
02:05:36,480 --> 02:05:37,790
back up if I first rejoin then that
whole calculus becomes impossible

7252
02:05:37,790 --> 02:05:37,800
whole calculus becomes impossible
 

7253
02:05:37,800 --> 02:05:39,290
whole calculus becomes impossible
because there is no more me anymore

7254
02:05:39,290 --> 02:05:39,300
because there is no more me anymore
 

7255
02:05:39,300 --> 02:05:41,330
because there is no more me anymore
there's just we and then and then we

7256
02:05:41,330 --> 02:05:41,340
there's just we and then and then we
 

7257
02:05:41,340 --> 02:05:43,310
there's just we and then and then we
will go eat this thing right so so this

7258
02:05:43,310 --> 02:05:43,320
will go eat this thing right so so this
 

7259
02:05:43,320 --> 02:05:44,810
will go eat this thing right so so this
interesting you know this this you can

7260
02:05:44,810 --> 02:05:44,820
interesting you know this this you can
 

7261
02:05:44,820 --> 02:05:46,850
interesting you know this this you can
imagine a kind of game theory where the

7262
02:05:46,850 --> 02:05:46,860
imagine a kind of game theory where the
 

7263
02:05:46,860 --> 02:05:49,010
imagine a kind of game theory where the
number of Agents isn't fixed and that

7264
02:05:49,010 --> 02:05:49,020
number of Agents isn't fixed and that
 

7265
02:05:49,020 --> 02:05:50,570
number of Agents isn't fixed and that
it's not just cooperate or defect but

7266
02:05:50,570 --> 02:05:50,580
it's not just cooperate or defect but
 

7267
02:05:50,580 --> 02:05:52,189
it's not just cooperate or defect but
it's actually merge and and whatever

7268
02:05:52,189 --> 02:05:52,199
it's actually merge and and whatever
 

7269
02:05:52,199 --> 02:05:54,169
it's actually merge and and whatever
right yeah so that kind of that that

7270
02:05:54,169 --> 02:05:54,179
right yeah so that kind of that that
 

7271
02:05:54,179 --> 02:05:56,149
right yeah so that kind of that that
competition how does it do that decision

7272
02:05:56,149 --> 02:05:56,159
competition how does it do that decision
 

7273
02:05:56,159 --> 02:05:58,970
competition how does it do that decision
making yeah so so that right so so it's

7274
02:05:58,970 --> 02:05:58,980
making yeah so so that right so so it's
 

7275
02:05:58,980 --> 02:06:00,649
making yeah so so that right so so it's
it's really interesting and so and so

7276
02:06:00,649 --> 02:06:00,659
it's really interesting and so and so
 

7277
02:06:00,659 --> 02:06:02,149
it's really interesting and so and so
empirically what we found is that it

7278
02:06:02,149 --> 02:06:02,159
empirically what we found is that it
 

7279
02:06:02,159 --> 02:06:04,250
empirically what we found is that it
tends to merge first it tends to merge

7280
02:06:04,250 --> 02:06:04,260
tends to merge first it tends to merge
 

7281
02:06:04,260 --> 02:06:05,689
tends to merge first it tends to merge
first and then the whole thing goes but

7282
02:06:05,689 --> 02:06:05,699
first and then the whole thing goes but
 

7283
02:06:05,699 --> 02:06:07,250
first and then the whole thing goes but
but it's really interesting that that

7284
02:06:07,250 --> 02:06:07,260
but it's really interesting that that
 

7285
02:06:07,260 --> 02:06:08,990
but it's really interesting that that
that that that calculus like do we even

7286
02:06:08,990 --> 02:06:09,000
that that that calculus like do we even
 

7287
02:06:09,000 --> 02:06:10,609
that that that calculus like do we even
have I mean I'm not an expert in the

7288
02:06:10,609 --> 02:06:10,619
have I mean I'm not an expert in the
 

7289
02:06:10,619 --> 02:06:12,169
have I mean I'm not an expert in the
economic Game Theory and all that but

7290
02:06:12,169 --> 02:06:12,179
economic Game Theory and all that but
 

7291
02:06:12,179 --> 02:06:13,609
economic Game Theory and all that but
maybe there's account maybe some sort of

7292
02:06:13,609 --> 02:06:13,619
maybe there's account maybe some sort of
 

7293
02:06:13,619 --> 02:06:15,290
maybe there's account maybe some sort of
hyperbolic discounting or something but

7294
02:06:15,290 --> 02:06:15,300
hyperbolic discounting or something but
 

7295
02:06:15,300 --> 02:06:18,050
hyperbolic discounting or something but
but maybe you know this idea that the

7296
02:06:18,050 --> 02:06:18,060
but maybe you know this idea that the
 

7297
02:06:18,060 --> 02:06:20,810
but maybe you know this idea that the
the actions you take not only change

7298
02:06:20,810 --> 02:06:20,820
the actions you take not only change
 

7299
02:06:20,820 --> 02:06:24,169
the actions you take not only change
your payoff but they change who or what

7300
02:06:24,169 --> 02:06:24,179
your payoff but they change who or what
 

7301
02:06:24,179 --> 02:06:25,970
your payoff but they change who or what
you are and that you may not you you

7302
02:06:25,970 --> 02:06:25,980
you are and that you may not you you
 

7303
02:06:25,980 --> 02:06:27,709
you are and that you may not you you
could take an action after which you

7304
02:06:27,709 --> 02:06:27,719
could take an action after which you
 

7305
02:06:27,719 --> 02:06:29,750
could take an action after which you
don't exist anymore or you are radically

7306
02:06:29,750 --> 02:06:29,760
don't exist anymore or you are radically
 

7307
02:06:29,760 --> 02:06:31,189
don't exist anymore or you are radically
changed or you are merged with somebody

7308
02:06:31,189 --> 02:06:31,199
changed or you are merged with somebody
 

7309
02:06:31,199 --> 02:06:33,830
changed or you are merged with somebody
else like that's I you know as far as I

7310
02:06:33,830 --> 02:06:33,840
else like that's I you know as far as I
 

7311
02:06:33,840 --> 02:06:35,570
else like that's I you know as far as I
know that's a whole you know we're still

7312
02:06:35,570 --> 02:06:35,580
know that's a whole you know we're still
 

7313
02:06:35,580 --> 02:06:37,550
know that's a whole you know we're still
missing a formalism for even knowing how

7314
02:06:37,550 --> 02:06:37,560
missing a formalism for even knowing how
 

7315
02:06:37,560 --> 02:06:40,129
missing a formalism for even knowing how
to how to model any of that DC evolution

7316
02:06:40,129 --> 02:06:40,139
to how to model any of that DC evolution
 

7317
02:06:40,139 --> 02:06:42,470
to how to model any of that DC evolution
by the way is a process that applies

7318
02:06:42,470 --> 02:06:42,480
by the way is a process that applies
 

7319
02:06:42,480 --> 02:06:44,450
by the way is a process that applies
here on Earth or is it some where did

7320
02:06:44,450 --> 02:06:44,460
here on Earth or is it some where did
 

7321
02:06:44,460 --> 02:06:48,530
here on Earth or is it some where did
Evolution come from yeah yeah so this

7322
02:06:48,530 --> 02:06:48,540
Evolution come from yeah yeah so this
 

7323
02:06:48,540 --> 02:06:49,370
Evolution come from yeah yeah so this
thing

7324
02:06:49,370 --> 02:06:49,380
thing
 

7325
02:06:49,380 --> 02:06:50,990
thing
um that from the very origin of life

7326
02:06:50,990 --> 02:06:51,000
um that from the very origin of life
 

7327
02:06:51,000 --> 02:06:52,970
um that from the very origin of life
that took us to today what what what the

7328
02:06:52,970 --> 02:06:52,980
that took us to today what what what the
 

7329
02:06:52,980 --> 02:06:56,169
that took us to today what what what the
heck is that I think evolution is

7330
02:06:56,169 --> 02:06:56,179
heck is that I think evolution is
 

7331
02:06:56,179 --> 02:06:58,850
heck is that I think evolution is
inevitable in the sense that if you

7332
02:06:58,850 --> 02:06:58,860
inevitable in the sense that if you
 

7333
02:06:58,860 --> 02:07:01,010
inevitable in the sense that if you
combine and and basically I think one of

7334
02:07:01,010 --> 02:07:01,020
combine and and basically I think one of
 

7335
02:07:01,020 --> 02:07:02,990
combine and and basically I think one of
the most uh useful things that was done

7336
02:07:02,990 --> 02:07:03,000
the most uh useful things that was done
 

7337
02:07:03,000 --> 02:07:05,689
the most uh useful things that was done
in early Computing I guess in the 60s it

7338
02:07:05,689 --> 02:07:05,699
in early Computing I guess in the 60s it
 

7339
02:07:05,699 --> 02:07:07,310
in early Computing I guess in the 60s it
started was was evolutionary computation

7340
02:07:07,310 --> 02:07:07,320
started was was evolutionary computation
 

7341
02:07:07,320 --> 02:07:11,810
started was was evolutionary computation
and just showing how how uh simple it is

7342
02:07:11,810 --> 02:07:11,820
and just showing how how uh simple it is
 

7343
02:07:11,820 --> 02:07:14,030
and just showing how how uh simple it is
that if you have if you have imperfect

7344
02:07:14,030 --> 02:07:14,040
that if you have if you have imperfect
 

7345
02:07:14,040 --> 02:07:17,209
that if you have if you have imperfect
heredity and competition together those

7346
02:07:17,209 --> 02:07:17,219
heredity and competition together those
 

7347
02:07:17,219 --> 02:07:18,649
heredity and competition together those
two things were three things right so

7348
02:07:18,649 --> 02:07:18,659
two things were three things right so
 

7349
02:07:18,659 --> 02:07:20,450
two things were three things right so
heredity imperfect heredity and

7350
02:07:20,450 --> 02:07:20,460
heredity imperfect heredity and
 

7351
02:07:20,460 --> 02:07:22,669
heredity imperfect heredity and
competition or selection those three

7352
02:07:22,669 --> 02:07:22,679
competition or selection those three
 

7353
02:07:22,679 --> 02:07:25,010
competition or selection those three
things and that's it now now now you're

7354
02:07:25,010 --> 02:07:25,020
things and that's it now now now you're
 

7355
02:07:25,020 --> 02:07:26,689
things and that's it now now now you're
you're off through the races right and

7356
02:07:26,689 --> 02:07:26,699
you're off through the races right and
 

7357
02:07:26,699 --> 02:07:28,850
you're off through the races right and
so that can be it's not just on Earth

7358
02:07:28,850 --> 02:07:28,860
so that can be it's not just on Earth
 

7359
02:07:28,860 --> 02:07:30,050
so that can be it's not just on Earth
because it can be done in the computer

7360
02:07:30,050 --> 02:07:30,060
because it can be done in the computer
 

7361
02:07:30,060 --> 02:07:31,729
because it can be done in the computer
it can be done in chemical systems it

7362
02:07:31,729 --> 02:07:31,739
it can be done in chemical systems it
 

7363
02:07:31,739 --> 02:07:33,530
it can be done in chemical systems it
can be done in um you know Elise Mullen

7364
02:07:33,530 --> 02:07:33,540
can be done in um you know Elise Mullen
 

7365
02:07:33,540 --> 02:07:35,629
can be done in um you know Elise Mullen
says it it works in on on you know

7366
02:07:35,629 --> 02:07:35,639
says it it works in on on you know
 

7367
02:07:35,639 --> 02:07:39,770
says it it works in on on you know
Cosmic scales so I think that uh that

7368
02:07:39,770 --> 02:07:39,780
Cosmic scales so I think that uh that
 

7369
02:07:39,780 --> 02:07:41,870
Cosmic scales so I think that uh that
kind of thing is incredibly

7370
02:07:41,870 --> 02:07:41,880
kind of thing is incredibly
 

7371
02:07:41,880 --> 02:07:44,330
kind of thing is incredibly
um pervasive and and and and general

7372
02:07:44,330 --> 02:07:44,340
um pervasive and and and and general
 

7373
02:07:44,340 --> 02:07:46,550
um pervasive and and and and general
it's a general feature of life it's it's

7374
02:07:46,550 --> 02:07:46,560
it's a general feature of life it's it's
 

7375
02:07:46,560 --> 02:07:48,530
it's a general feature of life it's it's
interesting to think about

7376
02:07:48,530 --> 02:07:48,540
interesting to think about
 

7377
02:07:48,540 --> 02:07:50,870
interesting to think about
you know the standard uh the standard

7378
02:07:50,870 --> 02:07:50,880
you know the standard uh the standard
 

7379
02:07:50,880 --> 02:07:52,790
you know the standard uh the standard
thought about this is that it's uh it's

7380
02:07:52,790 --> 02:07:52,800
thought about this is that it's uh it's
 

7381
02:07:52,800 --> 02:07:54,709
thought about this is that it's uh it's
blind right meaning that the the the

7382
02:07:54,709 --> 02:07:54,719
blind right meaning that the the the
 

7383
02:07:54,719 --> 02:07:56,570
blind right meaning that the the the
intelligence of the process is zero it's

7384
02:07:56,570 --> 02:07:56,580
intelligence of the process is zero it's
 

7385
02:07:56,580 --> 02:07:57,649
intelligence of the process is zero it's
stumbling around

7386
02:07:57,649 --> 02:07:57,659
stumbling around
 

7387
02:07:57,659 --> 02:08:01,609
stumbling around
and I think that back in the day when

7388
02:08:01,609 --> 02:08:01,619
and I think that back in the day when
 

7389
02:08:01,619 --> 02:08:03,890
and I think that back in the day when
the options with the options were it's

7390
02:08:03,890 --> 02:08:03,900
the options with the options were it's
 

7391
02:08:03,900 --> 02:08:06,350
the options with the options were it's
dumb like machines or it's smart like

7392
02:08:06,350 --> 02:08:06,360
dumb like machines or it's smart like
 

7393
02:08:06,360 --> 02:08:07,669
dumb like machines or it's smart like
humans then of course the scientists

7394
02:08:07,669 --> 02:08:07,679
humans then of course the scientists
 

7395
02:08:07,679 --> 02:08:09,050
humans then of course the scientists
went in this direction because nobody

7396
02:08:09,050 --> 02:08:09,060
went in this direction because nobody
 

7397
02:08:09,060 --> 02:08:10,430
went in this direction because nobody
wanted creationism and so they said okay

7398
02:08:10,430 --> 02:08:10,440
wanted creationism and so they said okay
 

7399
02:08:10,440 --> 02:08:12,169
wanted creationism and so they said okay
it's got to be like completely blind I'm

7400
02:08:12,169 --> 02:08:12,179
it's got to be like completely blind I'm
 

7401
02:08:12,179 --> 02:08:13,729
it's got to be like completely blind I'm
not actually sure right because because

7402
02:08:13,729 --> 02:08:13,739
not actually sure right because because
 

7403
02:08:13,739 --> 02:08:15,709
not actually sure right because because
I I think that um I think that

7404
02:08:15,709 --> 02:08:15,719
I I think that um I think that
 

7405
02:08:15,719 --> 02:08:17,629
I I think that um I think that
everything is a Continuum and I think

7406
02:08:17,629 --> 02:08:17,639
everything is a Continuum and I think
 

7407
02:08:17,639 --> 02:08:19,550
everything is a Continuum and I think
that it doesn't have to be smart with

7408
02:08:19,550 --> 02:08:19,560
that it doesn't have to be smart with
 

7409
02:08:19,560 --> 02:08:21,709
that it doesn't have to be smart with
foresight like us but it doesn't have to

7410
02:08:21,709 --> 02:08:21,719
foresight like us but it doesn't have to
 

7411
02:08:21,719 --> 02:08:23,570
foresight like us but it doesn't have to
be completely blind either I think there

7412
02:08:23,570 --> 02:08:23,580
be completely blind either I think there
 

7413
02:08:23,580 --> 02:08:25,910
be completely blind either I think there
may be aspects of it and in particular

7414
02:08:25,910 --> 02:08:25,920
may be aspects of it and in particular
 

7415
02:08:25,920 --> 02:08:27,890
may be aspects of it and in particular
this kind of multi-scale Competency

7416
02:08:27,890 --> 02:08:27,900
this kind of multi-scale Competency
 

7417
02:08:27,900 --> 02:08:30,589
this kind of multi-scale Competency
might give it a little bit of look ahead

7418
02:08:30,589 --> 02:08:30,599
might give it a little bit of look ahead
 

7419
02:08:30,599 --> 02:08:32,570
might give it a little bit of look ahead
maybe or a little bit of um problem

7420
02:08:32,570 --> 02:08:32,580
maybe or a little bit of um problem
 

7421
02:08:32,580 --> 02:08:36,169
maybe or a little bit of um problem
solving sort of baked in but but that's

7422
02:08:36,169 --> 02:08:36,179
solving sort of baked in but but that's
 

7423
02:08:36,179 --> 02:08:37,370
solving sort of baked in but but that's
going to be completely different in

7424
02:08:37,370 --> 02:08:37,380
going to be completely different in
 

7425
02:08:37,380 --> 02:08:39,770
going to be completely different in
different in different systems but I do

7426
02:08:39,770 --> 02:08:39,780
different in different systems but I do
 

7427
02:08:39,780 --> 02:08:41,030
different in different systems but I do
think I do think it's General I don't

7428
02:08:41,030 --> 02:08:41,040
think I do think it's General I don't
 

7429
02:08:41,040 --> 02:08:42,530
think I do think it's General I don't
think it's just on Earth I think it's a

7430
02:08:42,530 --> 02:08:42,540
think it's just on Earth I think it's a
 

7431
02:08:42,540 --> 02:08:44,689
think it's just on Earth I think it's a
very fundamental thing and it does seem

7432
02:08:44,689 --> 02:08:44,699
very fundamental thing and it does seem
 

7433
02:08:44,699 --> 02:08:47,089
very fundamental thing and it does seem
to have a kind of direction that is

7434
02:08:47,089 --> 02:08:47,099
to have a kind of direction that is
 

7435
02:08:47,099 --> 02:08:48,229
to have a kind of direction that is
taking us

7436
02:08:48,229 --> 02:08:48,239
taking us
 

7437
02:08:48,239 --> 02:08:51,169
taking us
that's somehow perhaps is defined by the

7438
02:08:51,169 --> 02:08:51,179
that's somehow perhaps is defined by the
 

7439
02:08:51,179 --> 02:08:52,910
that's somehow perhaps is defined by the
environment itself

7440
02:08:52,910 --> 02:08:52,920
environment itself
 

7441
02:08:52,920 --> 02:08:54,470
environment itself
it feels like we're headed towards

7442
02:08:54,470 --> 02:08:54,480
it feels like we're headed towards
 

7443
02:08:54,480 --> 02:08:55,970
it feels like we're headed towards
something

7444
02:08:55,970 --> 02:08:55,980
something
 

7445
02:08:55,980 --> 02:08:57,050
something
like

7446
02:08:57,050 --> 02:08:57,060
like
 

7447
02:08:57,060 --> 02:08:59,689
like
we're playing out a script that was just

7448
02:08:59,689 --> 02:08:59,699
we're playing out a script that was just
 

7449
02:08:59,699 --> 02:09:01,609
we're playing out a script that was just
like a single cell defines the entire

7450
02:09:01,609 --> 02:09:01,619
like a single cell defines the entire
 

7451
02:09:01,619 --> 02:09:04,970
like a single cell defines the entire
organism yeah it feels like from the

7452
02:09:04,970 --> 02:09:04,980
organism yeah it feels like from the
 

7453
02:09:04,980 --> 02:09:07,490
organism yeah it feels like from the
origin of Earth itself

7454
02:09:07,490 --> 02:09:07,500
origin of Earth itself
 

7455
02:09:07,500 --> 02:09:10,310
origin of Earth itself
playing out a kind of script yeah you

7456
02:09:10,310 --> 02:09:10,320
playing out a kind of script yeah you
 

7457
02:09:10,320 --> 02:09:13,490
playing out a kind of script yeah you
can't really go any other way I mean so

7458
02:09:13,490 --> 02:09:13,500
can't really go any other way I mean so
 

7459
02:09:13,500 --> 02:09:15,109
can't really go any other way I mean so
this is very controversial and I don't

7460
02:09:15,109 --> 02:09:15,119
this is very controversial and I don't
 

7461
02:09:15,119 --> 02:09:16,790
this is very controversial and I don't
know the answer but people have people

7462
02:09:16,790 --> 02:09:16,800
know the answer but people have people
 

7463
02:09:16,800 --> 02:09:19,790
know the answer but people have people
have argued that this is called uh you

7464
02:09:19,790 --> 02:09:19,800
have argued that this is called uh you
 

7465
02:09:19,800 --> 02:09:21,350
have argued that this is called uh you
know sort of rewinding the tape of life

7466
02:09:21,350 --> 02:09:21,360
know sort of rewinding the tape of life
 

7467
02:09:21,360 --> 02:09:23,270
know sort of rewinding the tape of life
right and and some people have argued I

7468
02:09:23,270 --> 02:09:23,280
right and and some people have argued I
 

7469
02:09:23,280 --> 02:09:25,250
right and and some people have argued I
think I think I think Conway Morris

7470
02:09:25,250 --> 02:09:25,260
think I think I think Conway Morris
 

7471
02:09:25,260 --> 02:09:28,129
think I think I think Conway Morris
maybe has argued that it it is that

7472
02:09:28,129 --> 02:09:28,139
maybe has argued that it it is that
 

7473
02:09:28,139 --> 02:09:29,990
maybe has argued that it it is that
there's a deep attractor for example to

7474
02:09:29,990 --> 02:09:30,000
there's a deep attractor for example to
 

7475
02:09:30,000 --> 02:09:31,970
there's a deep attractor for example to
human to the human um

7476
02:09:31,970 --> 02:09:31,980
human to the human um
 

7477
02:09:31,980 --> 02:09:34,550
human to the human um
uh kind of uh structure and that and

7478
02:09:34,550 --> 02:09:34,560
uh kind of uh structure and that and
 

7479
02:09:34,560 --> 02:09:35,570
uh kind of uh structure and that and
that if you were to rewind it again

7480
02:09:35,570 --> 02:09:35,580
that if you were to rewind it again
 

7481
02:09:35,580 --> 02:09:36,830
that if you were to rewind it again
you'd basically get more or less the

7482
02:09:36,830 --> 02:09:36,840
you'd basically get more or less the
 

7483
02:09:36,840 --> 02:09:38,089
you'd basically get more or less the
same thing and then other people have

7484
02:09:38,089 --> 02:09:38,099
same thing and then other people have
 

7485
02:09:38,099 --> 02:09:39,589
same thing and then other people have
argued that no it's it's incredibly

7486
02:09:39,589 --> 02:09:39,599
argued that no it's it's incredibly
 

7487
02:09:39,599 --> 02:09:41,390
argued that no it's it's incredibly
sensitive to Frozen accidents and then

7488
02:09:41,390 --> 02:09:41,400
sensitive to Frozen accidents and then
 

7489
02:09:41,400 --> 02:09:44,030
sensitive to Frozen accidents and then
once a certain stochastic decisions are

7490
02:09:44,030 --> 02:09:44,040
once a certain stochastic decisions are
 

7491

you know we're very bad at predicting uh

7496
02:09:50,750 --> 02:09:50,760
you know we're very bad at predicting uh
 

7497

02:10:53,709 --> 02:10:53,719
I mean there might be a kind of
 

7553
02:10:53,719 --> 02:10:58,250
I mean there might be a kind of

something yeah maybe maybe I don't it's
 

7567
02:11:17,040 --> 02:11:19,370
something yeah maybe maybe I don't it's
it's it's difficult I think one of the

7568
02:11:19,370 --> 02:11:19,380
it's it's difficult I think one of the
 

7569
02:11:19,380 --> 02:11:21,950
it's it's difficult I think one of the

02:11:28,129 --> 02:11:28,139
of those things are that we have to
 

7577
02:11:28,139 --> 02:11:31,070
of those things are that we have to
start developing a better science of

02:11:31,070 --> 02:11:31,080
start developing a better science of
 

7579

good at it right we don't know uh if if

02:11:38,870 --> 02:11:38,880
good at it right we don't know uh if if
 

7585
02:11:38,880 --> 02:11:41,209
good at it right we don't know uh if if
if if I create a composite system and

what is the emergent intelligence of

02:11:49,490 --> 02:11:49,500
what is the emergent intelligence of
 

7595
02:11:49,500 --> 02:11:50,990
what is the emergent intelligence of
this thing first of all what level is it

7596
02:11:50,990 --> 02:11:51,000
this thing first of all what level is it
 

7597
02:11:51,000 --> 02:11:52,729
this thing first of all what level is it
going to be at and if it has goal

7598
02:11:52,729 --> 02:11:52,739
going to be at and if it has goal
 

7599
02:11:52,739 --> 02:11:54,530
going to be at and if it has goal
directed capacity what are the goals

7600
02:11:54,530 --> 02:11:54,540

7601
02:11:54,540 --> 02:11:56,629

going to be like we are just not very

7602
02:11:56,629 --> 02:11:56,639
going to be like we are just not very
 

7603
02:11:56,639 --> 02:11:58,729
going to be like we are just not very
good at predicting that yet and I think

7604
02:11:58,729 --> 02:11:58,739
good at predicting that yet and I think
 

7605
02:11:58,739 --> 02:12:01,669
good at predicting that yet and I think
that uh it's it's a

7606
02:12:01,669 --> 02:12:01,679
that uh it's it's a
 

7607
02:12:01,679 --> 02:12:06,229
that uh it's it's a
it's a it's a existential level uh need

7608
02:12:06,229 --> 02:12:06,239
it's a it's a existential level uh need
 

7609
02:12:06,239 --> 02:12:07,550
it's a it's a existential level uh need
for us to be able to because we're

02:12:07,550 --> 02:12:07,560
for us to be able to because we're
 

7611
02:12:07,560 --> 02:12:08,870
for us to be able to because we're
building these things all the time right

7612
02:12:08,870 --> 02:12:08,880
building these things all the time right
 

7613
02:12:08,880 --> 02:12:10,910
building these things all the time right
we're building we're building both

7614
02:12:10,910 --> 02:12:10,920
we're building we're building both
 

7615
02:12:10,920 --> 02:12:12,890
we're building we're building both
physical structures like swarm Robotics

7616
02:12:12,890 --> 02:12:12,900
physical structures like swarm Robotics
 

7617
02:12:12,900 --> 02:12:15,470
physical structures like swarm Robotics
and we're building uh a social Financial

7618
02:12:15,470 --> 02:12:15,480
and we're building uh a social Financial
 

7619
02:12:15,480 --> 02:12:18,290
and we're building uh a social Financial
structures and so on with very little

7620
02:12:18,290 --> 02:12:18,300
structures and so on with very little
 

7621
02:12:18,300 --> 02:12:20,629

ability to uh predict what sort of

7622
02:12:20,629 --> 02:12:20,639
ability to uh predict what sort of
 

7623
02:12:20,639 --> 02:12:22,189
ability to uh predict what sort of
autonomous goals that system is going to

7624
02:12:22,189 --> 02:12:22,199
autonomous goals that system is going to
 

7625
02:12:22,199 --> 02:12:24,470
autonomous goals that system is going to
have of which we are now cogs and so

7626
02:12:24,470 --> 02:12:24,480
have of which we are now cogs and so
 

7627
02:12:24,480 --> 02:12:26,330
have of which we are now cogs and so
right so so learning learning to predict

7628
02:12:26,330 --> 02:12:26,340
right so so learning learning to predict
 

7629
02:12:26,340 --> 02:12:27,649
right so so learning learning to predict
and control those things is going to be

7630
02:12:27,649 --> 02:12:27,659
and control those things is going to be
 

7631
02:12:27,659 --> 02:12:30,229
and control those things is going to be
critical so we've so so in fact so so if

7632
02:12:30,229 --> 02:12:30,239
critical so we've so so in fact so so if
 

7633
02:12:30,239 --> 02:12:31,550
critical so we've so so in fact so so if
you're right and there is some kind of

7634
02:12:31,550 --> 02:12:31,560
you're right and there is some kind of
 

7635
02:12:31,560 --> 02:12:33,830
you're right and there is some kind of
attractor to Evolution it would be nice

7636
02:12:33,830 --> 02:12:33,840
attractor to Evolution it would be nice
 

7637
02:12:33,840 --> 02:12:36,530
attractor to Evolution it would be nice
to know what that is and then to make a

7638
02:12:36,530 --> 02:12:36,540
to know what that is and then to make a
 

7639
02:12:36,540 --> 02:12:37,850
to know what that is and then to make a
rational decision of whether we're going

7640
02:12:37,850 --> 02:12:37,860
rational decision of whether we're going
 

7641
02:12:37,860 --> 02:12:39,169
rational decision of whether we're going
to go along or we're going to pop out of

7642
02:12:39,169 --> 02:12:39,179
to go along or we're going to pop out of
 

7643
02:12:39,179 --> 02:12:41,209
to go along or we're going to pop out of
it or try to pop out of it because

7644
02:12:41,209 --> 02:12:41,219
it or try to pop out of it because
 

7645
02:12:41,219 --> 02:12:42,350
it or try to pop out of it because
there's no guarantee I mean that's

7646
02:12:42,350 --> 02:12:42,360
there's no guarantee I mean that's
 

7647
02:12:42,360 --> 02:12:43,850
there's no guarantee I mean that's
that's the other you know kind of

7648
02:12:43,850 --> 02:12:43,860
that's the other you know kind of
 

7649
02:12:43,860 --> 02:12:45,709
that's the other you know kind of
important thing a lot of people

7650
02:12:45,709 --> 02:12:45,719
important thing a lot of people
 

7651
02:12:45,719 --> 02:12:47,810
important thing a lot of people
I get a lot of complaints uh from from

7652
02:12:47,810 --> 02:12:47,820
I get a lot of complaints uh from from
 

7653
02:12:47,820 --> 02:12:49,850
I get a lot of complaints uh from from
people email me and say yeah you know

7654
02:12:49,850 --> 02:12:49,860
people email me and say yeah you know
 

7655
02:12:49,860 --> 02:12:51,649
people email me and say yeah you know
what you're doing uh it isn't natural

7656
02:12:51,649 --> 02:12:51,659
what you're doing uh it isn't natural
 

7657
02:12:51,659 --> 02:12:55,010
what you're doing uh it isn't natural
you know and I'll say look natural that

7658
02:12:55,010 --> 02:12:55,020
you know and I'll say look natural that
 

7659
02:12:55,020 --> 02:12:56,689
you know and I'll say look natural that
that'd be nice if if somebody was making

7660
02:12:56,689 --> 02:12:56,699
that'd be nice if if somebody was making
 

7661
02:12:56,699 --> 02:12:59,450
that'd be nice if if somebody was making
sure that natural was was was matched up

7662
02:12:59,450 --> 02:12:59,460
sure that natural was was was matched up
 

7663
02:12:59,460 --> 02:13:01,430
sure that natural was was was matched up
to our values but no one's doing that

7664
02:13:01,430 --> 02:13:01,440
to our values but no one's doing that
 

7665
02:13:01,440 --> 02:13:03,350
to our values but no one's doing that
but you know Evolution optimizes for

7666
02:13:03,350 --> 02:13:03,360
but you know Evolution optimizes for
 

7667
02:13:03,360 --> 02:13:05,450
but you know Evolution optimizes for
biomass that's it nobody's optimizing

7668
02:13:05,450 --> 02:13:05,460
biomass that's it nobody's optimizing
 

7669
02:13:05,460 --> 02:13:07,010
biomass that's it nobody's optimizing
it's not optimizing for your happiness

7670
02:13:07,010 --> 02:13:07,020
it's not optimizing for your happiness
 

7671
02:13:07,020 --> 02:13:08,450
it's not optimizing for your happiness
it's I don't think necessarily it's

7672
02:13:08,450 --> 02:13:08,460
it's I don't think necessarily it's
 

7673
02:13:08,460 --> 02:13:10,550
it's I don't think necessarily it's
optimizing for for for intelligence or

7674
02:13:10,550 --> 02:13:10,560
optimizing for for for intelligence or
 

7675
02:13:10,560 --> 02:13:12,410
optimizing for for for intelligence or
fairness or any of that stuff I'm gonna

7676
02:13:12,410 --> 02:13:12,420
fairness or any of that stuff I'm gonna
 

7677
02:13:12,420 --> 02:13:15,350
fairness or any of that stuff I'm gonna
find that person that emailed you beat

7678
02:13:15,350 --> 02:13:15,360
find that person that emailed you beat
 

7679
02:13:15,360 --> 02:13:18,410
find that person that emailed you beat
them up take their place

7680
02:13:18,410 --> 02:13:18,420
them up take their place
 

7681
02:13:18,420 --> 02:13:20,689
them up take their place
um steal everything they own and say now

7682
02:13:20,689 --> 02:13:20,699
um steal everything they own and say now
 

7683
02:13:20,699 --> 02:13:22,370
um steal everything they own and say now
we're now this is natural this is

7684
02:13:22,370 --> 02:13:22,380
we're now this is natural this is
 

7685
02:13:22,380 --> 02:13:24,290
we're now this is natural this is
natural yeah exactly because because it

7686
02:13:24,290 --> 02:13:24,300
natural yeah exactly because because it
 

7687
02:13:24,300 --> 02:13:25,970
natural yeah exactly because because it
comes from it comes from a from an old

7688
02:13:25,970 --> 02:13:25,980
comes from it comes from a from an old
 

7689
02:13:25,980 --> 02:13:29,330
comes from it comes from a from an old
world view where you could assume that

7690
02:13:29,330 --> 02:13:29,340
world view where you could assume that
 

7691
02:13:29,340 --> 02:13:30,770
world view where you could assume that
whatever is natural that that's probably

7692
02:13:30,770 --> 02:13:30,780
whatever is natural that that's probably
 

7693
02:13:30,780 --> 02:13:32,390
whatever is natural that that's probably
for the best and I think we're long out

7694
02:13:32,390 --> 02:13:32,400
for the best and I think we're long out
 

7695
02:13:32,400 --> 02:13:35,330
for the best and I think we're long out
of that Garden of Eden kind of view so I

7696
02:13:35,330 --> 02:13:35,340
of that Garden of Eden kind of view so I
 

7697
02:13:35,340 --> 02:13:37,069
of that Garden of Eden kind of view so I
think we can do better we I think we and

7698
02:13:37,069 --> 02:13:37,079
think we can do better we I think we and
 

7699
02:13:37,079 --> 02:13:39,109
think we can do better we I think we and
we have to right natural it just isn't

7700
02:13:39,109 --> 02:13:39,119
we have to right natural it just isn't
 

7701
02:13:39,119 --> 02:13:40,970
we have to right natural it just isn't
great for for a lot of a lot of life

7702
02:13:40,970 --> 02:13:40,980
great for for a lot of a lot of life
 

7703
02:13:40,980 --> 02:13:43,310
great for for a lot of a lot of life
forms what are some cool synthetic

7704
02:13:43,310 --> 02:13:43,320
forms what are some cool synthetic
 

7705
02:13:43,320 --> 02:13:45,290
forms what are some cool synthetic
organisms that you you think about you

7706
02:13:45,290 --> 02:13:45,300
organisms that you you think about you
 

7707
02:13:45,300 --> 02:13:47,030
organisms that you you think about you
dream about out when you think about

7708
02:13:47,030 --> 02:13:47,040
dream about out when you think about
 

7709
02:13:47,040 --> 02:13:50,510
dream about out when you think about
embodied mind what do you imagine what

7710
02:13:50,510 --> 02:13:50,520
embodied mind what do you imagine what
 

7711
02:13:50,520 --> 02:13:52,910
embodied mind what do you imagine what
do you hope to build yeah on a practical

7712
02:13:52,910 --> 02:13:52,920
do you hope to build yeah on a practical
 

7713
02:13:52,920 --> 02:13:56,330
do you hope to build yeah on a practical
level what I really hope to do is to

7714
02:13:56,330 --> 02:13:56,340
level what I really hope to do is to
 

7715
02:13:56,340 --> 02:13:58,310
level what I really hope to do is to
gain enough of an understanding of the

7716
02:13:58,310 --> 02:13:58,320
gain enough of an understanding of the
 

7717
02:13:58,320 --> 02:14:01,370
gain enough of an understanding of the
embodied intelligence of the organs and

7718
02:14:01,370 --> 02:14:01,380
embodied intelligence of the organs and
 

7719
02:14:01,380 --> 02:14:04,430
embodied intelligence of the organs and
tissues such that we can achieve a

7720
02:14:04,430 --> 02:14:04,440
tissues such that we can achieve a
 

7721
02:14:04,440 --> 02:14:05,569
tissues such that we can achieve a
radically different regenerative

7722
02:14:05,569 --> 02:14:05,579
radically different regenerative
 

7723
02:14:05,579 --> 02:14:08,750
radically different regenerative
medicine so that we can say basically

7724
02:14:08,750 --> 02:14:08,760
medicine so that we can say basically
 

7725
02:14:08,760 --> 02:14:11,510
medicine so that we can say basically
and I I think about it as um you know in

7726
02:14:11,510 --> 02:14:11,520
and I I think about it as um you know in
 

7727
02:14:11,520 --> 02:14:13,189
and I I think about it as um you know in
terms of like okay can you what's the

7728
02:14:13,189 --> 02:14:13,199
terms of like okay can you what's the
 

7729
02:14:13,199 --> 02:14:16,370
terms of like okay can you what's the
what's the uh uh what's the goal kind of

7730
02:14:16,370 --> 02:14:16,380
what's the uh uh what's the goal kind of
 

7731
02:14:16,380 --> 02:14:18,649
what's the uh uh what's the goal kind of
uh and and end game for this whole thing

7732
02:14:18,649 --> 02:14:18,659
uh and and end game for this whole thing
 

7733
02:14:18,659 --> 02:14:20,629
uh and and end game for this whole thing
to me the end game is something that you

7734
02:14:20,629 --> 02:14:20,639
to me the end game is something that you
 

7735
02:14:20,639 --> 02:14:22,790
to me the end game is something that you
would call an anatomical compiler so the

7736
02:14:22,790 --> 02:14:22,800
would call an anatomical compiler so the
 

7737
02:14:22,800 --> 02:14:24,169
would call an anatomical compiler so the
idea is you would sit down in front of

7738
02:14:24,169 --> 02:14:24,179
idea is you would sit down in front of
 

7739
02:14:24,179 --> 02:14:27,350
idea is you would sit down in front of
the computer and you would draw the the

7740
02:14:27,350 --> 02:14:27,360
the computer and you would draw the the
 

7741
02:14:27,360 --> 02:14:29,510
the computer and you would draw the the
body or the organ that you wanted not

7742
02:14:29,510 --> 02:14:29,520
body or the organ that you wanted not
 

7743
02:14:29,520 --> 02:14:31,609
body or the organ that you wanted not
not molecular details but like this is

7744
02:14:31,609 --> 02:14:31,619
not molecular details but like this is
 

7745
02:14:31,619 --> 02:14:33,649
not molecular details but like this is
what I want I want a six-legged uh you

7746
02:14:33,649 --> 02:14:33,659
what I want I want a six-legged uh you
 

7747
02:14:33,659 --> 02:14:35,270
what I want I want a six-legged uh you
know frog with a propeller on top or I

7748
02:14:35,270 --> 02:14:35,280
know frog with a propeller on top or I
 

7749
02:14:35,280 --> 02:14:36,709
know frog with a propeller on top or I
want I want a heart that looks like this

7750
02:14:36,709 --> 02:14:36,719
want I want a heart that looks like this
 

7751
02:14:36,719 --> 02:14:38,569
want I want a heart that looks like this
or I want a leg that looks like this and

7752
02:14:38,569 --> 02:14:38,579
or I want a leg that looks like this and
 

7753
02:14:38,579 --> 02:14:40,189
or I want a leg that looks like this and
what it would do if we knew what we were

7754
02:14:40,189 --> 02:14:40,199
what it would do if we knew what we were
 

7755
02:14:40,199 --> 02:14:41,510
what it would do if we knew what we were
doing is

7756
02:14:41,510 --> 02:14:41,520
doing is
 

7757
02:14:41,520 --> 02:14:43,910
doing is
put out uh it could convert that

7758
02:14:43,910 --> 02:14:43,920
put out uh it could convert that
 

7759
02:14:43,920 --> 02:14:46,370
put out uh it could convert that
anatomical description into a set of

7760
02:14:46,370 --> 02:14:46,380
anatomical description into a set of
 

7761
02:14:46,380 --> 02:14:47,870
anatomical description into a set of
stimuli that would have to be given to

7762
02:14:47,870 --> 02:14:47,880
stimuli that would have to be given to
 

7763
02:14:47,880 --> 02:14:49,609
stimuli that would have to be given to
cells to convince them to build exactly

7764
02:14:49,609 --> 02:14:49,619
cells to convince them to build exactly
 

7765
02:14:49,619 --> 02:14:51,770
cells to convince them to build exactly
that thing right I probably won't live

7766
02:14:51,770 --> 02:14:51,780
that thing right I probably won't live
 

7767
02:14:51,780 --> 02:14:53,390
that thing right I probably won't live
to see it but I think it's achievable

7768
02:14:53,390 --> 02:14:53,400
to see it but I think it's achievable
 

7769
02:14:53,400 --> 02:14:56,390
to see it but I think it's achievable
and I think what that if if we can have

7770
02:14:56,390 --> 02:14:56,400
and I think what that if if we can have
 

7771
02:14:56,400 --> 02:14:59,149
and I think what that if if we can have
that then that is basically the solution

7772
02:14:59,149 --> 02:14:59,159
that then that is basically the solution
 

7773
02:14:59,159 --> 02:15:02,569
that then that is basically the solution
to all of medicine except for infectious

7774
02:15:02,569 --> 02:15:02,579

build all of those things go away so

7782
02:15:10,970 --> 02:15:10,980
build all of those things go away so
 

7783
02:15:10,980 --> 02:15:14,450
build all of those things go away so
those things go away and the um positive

02:15:19,609 --> 02:15:19,619
all of the advances are increasingly

of a sinking ship when you're like 90

7792
02:15:23,450 --> 02:15:23,460

7793
02:15:23,460 --> 02:15:25,430
of a sinking ship when you're like 90
and then and so on right all of that

7794
02:15:25,430 --> 02:15:25,440
and then and so on right all of that
 

7795
02:15:25,440 --> 02:15:26,930
and then and so on right all of that
goes away because basically instead of

7796
02:15:26,930 --> 02:15:26,940
goes away because basically instead of
 

7797
02:15:26,940 --> 02:15:28,669
goes away because basically instead of

02:15:32,629 --> 02:15:32,639
um you progressively regenerate you know
 

7803
02:15:32,639 --> 02:15:33,830
um you progressively regenerate you know
you apply the regenerative medicine

7804
02:15:33,830 --> 02:15:33,840
you apply the regenerative medicine
 

7805
02:15:33,840 --> 02:15:36,470
you apply the regenerative medicine
early before things degrade so I think

7806
02:15:36,470 --> 02:15:36,480
early before things degrade so I think
 

7807
02:15:36,480 --> 02:15:38,330
early before things degrade so I think
that that'll have massive economic

7808
02:15:38,330 --> 02:15:38,340
that that'll have massive economic

02:15:38,340 --> 02:15:39,830
that that'll have massive economic

which is not at all you know sustainable
 

7813
02:15:41,820 --> 02:15:44,030
which is not at all you know sustainable
and uh and that that's what I hope I

7814
02:15:44,030 --> 02:15:44,040
and uh and that that's what I hope I
 

7815
02:15:44,040 --> 02:15:45,950
and uh and that that's what I hope I
hope that I hope that we get it so so to

7816
02:15:45,950 --> 02:15:45,960
hope that I hope that we get it so so to
 

7817
02:15:45,960 --> 02:15:49,010
hope that I hope that we get it so so to
me yes the xenobots will be doing useful

cleaning out you know your or you know

your joints and all that kind of stuff
 

7825
02:15:54,119 --> 02:15:56,750
your joints and all that kind of stuff
but more important than that I think we

7826
02:15:56,750 --> 02:15:56,760
but more important than that I think we
 

7827
02:15:56,760 --> 02:16:01,790
but more important than that I think we
can use these synthetic systems to try

7828
02:16:01,790 --> 02:16:01,800
can use these synthetic systems to try
 

7829
02:16:01,800 --> 02:16:04,550
can use these synthetic systems to try

and then sort of beyond that if we you

7838
02:16:13,010 --> 02:16:13,020
and then sort of beyond that if we you
 

7839
02:16:13,020 --> 02:16:14,450
and then sort of beyond that if we you
know sort of think further beyond that

7840
02:16:14,450 --> 02:16:14,460
know sort of think further beyond that
 

7841
02:16:14,460 --> 02:16:16,250
know sort of think further beyond that
what I hope is that kind of like what

02:16:16,250 --> 02:16:16,260
what I hope is that kind of like what
 

7843
02:16:16,260 --> 02:16:18,310
what I hope is that kind of like what
you said all of this drives a

7844
02:16:18,310 --> 02:16:18,320
you said all of this drives a
 

7845
02:16:18,320 --> 02:16:22,189
you said all of this drives a
reconsideration of how we formulate um

02:16:22,189 --> 02:16:22,199
reconsideration of how we formulate um
 

7847
02:16:22,199 --> 02:16:24,950
reconsideration of how we formulate um
ethical Norms because this old school so

7848
02:16:24,950 --> 02:16:24,960
ethical Norms because this old school so
 

7849
02:16:24,960 --> 02:16:26,870
ethical Norms because this old school so
so so in the olden days what you could

7850
02:16:26,870 --> 02:16:26,880
so so in the olden days what you could
 

7851
02:16:26,880 --> 02:16:29,390
so so in the olden days what you could
do is obviously we were confronted with

7852
02:16:29,390 --> 02:16:29,400
do is obviously we were confronted with
 

7853
02:16:29,400 --> 02:16:30,950
do is obviously we were confronted with
something you you could you could tap on

7854
02:16:30,950 --> 02:16:30,960
something you you could you could tap on
 

7855
02:16:30,960 --> 02:16:32,570
something you you could you could tap on
it right and if you heard a metallic

7856
02:16:32,570 --> 02:16:32,580
it right and if you heard a metallic
 

7857
02:16:32,580 --> 02:16:34,250
it right and if you heard a metallic
clanging sound you'd said ah fine right

7858
02:16:34,250 --> 02:16:34,260
clanging sound you'd said ah fine right
 

7859
02:16:34,260 --> 02:16:35,810
clanging sound you'd said ah fine right
so you could conclude it was made in a

7860
02:16:35,810 --> 02:16:35,820
so you could conclude it was made in a
 

7861
02:16:35,820 --> 02:16:37,549
so you could conclude it was made in a
factory I could take it apart I can do

7862
02:16:37,549 --> 02:16:37,559
factory I could take it apart I can do
 

7863
02:16:37,559 --> 02:16:39,049
factory I could take it apart I can do
whatever right if you did that and you

7864
02:16:39,049 --> 02:16:39,059
whatever right if you did that and you
 

7865
02:16:39,059 --> 02:16:40,730
whatever right if you did that and you
got you know sort of a squishy uh kind

7866
02:16:40,730 --> 02:16:40,740
got you know sort of a squishy uh kind
 

7867
02:16:40,740 --> 02:16:43,129
got you know sort of a squishy uh kind
of warm sensation you'd say I need to be

7868
02:16:43,129 --> 02:16:43,139
of warm sensation you'd say I need to be
 

7869
02:16:43,139 --> 02:16:44,570
of warm sensation you'd say I need to be
you know more or less nice to it and

7870
02:16:44,570 --> 02:16:44,580
you know more or less nice to it and
 

7871
02:16:44,580 --> 02:16:47,030
you know more or less nice to it and
whatever that's not going to be feasible

7872
02:16:47,030 --> 02:16:47,040
whatever that's not going to be feasible
 

7873
02:16:47,040 --> 02:16:48,709
whatever that's not going to be feasible
it was never really feasible but it was

7874
02:16:48,709 --> 02:16:48,719
it was never really feasible but it was
 

7875
02:16:48,719 --> 02:16:50,089
it was never really feasible but it was
good enough because we didn't have any

7876
02:16:50,089 --> 02:16:50,099
good enough because we didn't have any
 

7877
02:16:50,099 --> 02:16:52,429
good enough because we didn't have any
we didn't know any better that needs to

7878
02:16:52,429 --> 02:16:52,439
we didn't know any better that needs to
 

7879
02:16:52,439 --> 02:16:54,349
we didn't know any better that needs to
go and I think that

7880
02:16:54,349 --> 02:16:54,359
go and I think that
 

7881
02:16:54,359 --> 02:16:57,110
go and I think that
uh by by breaking down those artificial

02:16:57,110 --> 02:16:57,120
uh by by breaking down those artificial
 

7883
02:16:57,120 --> 02:17:01,549
uh by by breaking down those artificial
barriers someday we can try to build a a

facts of of our Earthly history but on
 

7891
02:17:08,580 --> 02:17:10,549

something much much deeper that you know

02:17:10,549 --> 02:17:10,559
something much much deeper that you know
 

7893
02:17:10,559 --> 02:17:14,209
something much much deeper that you know
really um takes takes agency and and the

02:17:14,209 --> 02:17:14,219
really um takes takes agency and and the
 

7895
02:17:14,219 --> 02:17:15,650
really um takes takes agency and and the
capacity to suffer and all that takes

7896
02:17:15,650 --> 02:17:15,660
capacity to suffer and all that takes
 

7897
02:17:15,660 --> 02:17:16,969

questions I would ask of a system is can

7902
02:17:21,110 --> 02:17:21,120
questions I would ask of a system is can
 

7903
02:17:21,120 --> 02:17:23,690
questions I would ask of a system is can
I eat it and can I have sex with it

7904
02:17:23,690 --> 02:17:23,700
I eat it and can I have sex with it
 

7905
02:17:23,700 --> 02:17:25,669
I eat it and can I have sex with it
um which is the the two fundamental

7906
02:17:25,669 --> 02:17:25,679
um which is the the two fundamental
 

7907
02:17:25,679 --> 02:17:28,509
um which is the the two fundamental
tests of Again The Human Condition

7908
02:17:28,509 --> 02:17:28,519
tests of Again The Human Condition
 

7909
02:17:28,519 --> 02:17:33,049
tests of Again The Human Condition
uh so I can basically do what Dali does

7910
02:17:33,049 --> 02:17:33,059
uh so I can basically do what Dali does
 

7911
02:17:33,059 --> 02:17:36,490
uh so I can basically do what Dali does
that's in the in in the physical space

7912
02:17:36,490 --> 02:17:36,500
that's in the in in the physical space
 

7913
02:17:36,500 --> 02:17:40,429
that's in the in in the physical space
so print out like a 3D print a Pepe the

7914
02:17:40,429 --> 02:17:40,439
so print out like a 3D print a Pepe the
 

7915
02:17:40,439 --> 02:17:42,110
so print out like a 3D print a Pepe the
frog with a propeller head

7916
02:17:42,110 --> 02:17:42,120
frog with a propeller head
 

7917
02:17:42,120 --> 02:17:43,910
frog with a propeller head
propeller hat

7918
02:17:43,910 --> 02:17:43,920
propeller hat
 

7919
02:17:43,920 --> 02:17:47,870
propeller hat
uh is the is the Dream well yes and no I

7920
02:17:47,870 --> 02:17:47,880
uh is the is the Dream well yes and no I
 

7921
02:17:47,880 --> 02:17:49,250
uh is the is the Dream well yes and no I
mean I want to get away from the 3D

7922
02:17:49,250 --> 02:17:49,260
mean I want to get away from the 3D
 

7923
02:17:49,260 --> 02:17:51,230
mean I want to get away from the 3D
printing thing because that will be

7924
02:17:51,230 --> 02:17:51,240
printing thing because that will be
 

7925
02:17:51,240 --> 02:17:53,570
printing thing because that will be
available for some things much earlier I

7926
02:17:53,570 --> 02:17:53,580
available for some things much earlier I
 

7927
02:17:53,580 --> 02:17:55,730
available for some things much earlier I
mean we can already do bladders and ears

7928
02:17:55,730 --> 02:17:55,740
mean we can already do bladders and ears
 

7929
02:17:55,740 --> 02:17:57,410
mean we can already do bladders and ears
and things like that because it's micro

7930
02:17:57,410 --> 02:17:57,420
and things like that because it's micro
 

7931
02:17:57,420 --> 02:17:59,270
and things like that because it's micro
level control right when you 3D print

7932
02:17:59,270 --> 02:17:59,280
level control right when you 3D print
 

7933
02:17:59,280 --> 02:18:01,129
level control right when you 3D print
you are in charge of where every cell

7934
02:18:01,129 --> 02:18:01,139
you are in charge of where every cell
 

7935
02:18:01,139 --> 02:18:02,570
you are in charge of where every cell
goes and for some things that you know

7936
02:18:02,570 --> 02:18:02,580
goes and for some things that you know
 

7937
02:18:02,580 --> 02:18:03,950
goes and for some things that you know
for for like this thing they had that I

7938
02:18:03,950 --> 02:18:03,960
for for like this thing they had that I
 

7939
02:18:03,960 --> 02:18:05,330
for for like this thing they had that I
think 20 years ago or maybe a little

7940
02:18:05,330 --> 02:18:05,340
think 20 years ago or maybe a little
 

7941
02:18:05,340 --> 02:18:06,950
think 20 years ago or maybe a little
earlier than that you could do that so

7942
02:18:06,950 --> 02:18:06,960
earlier than that you could do that so
 

7943
02:18:06,960 --> 02:18:08,629
earlier than that you could do that so
yeah I would like to have says the dolly

7944
02:18:08,629 --> 02:18:08,639
yeah I would like to have says the dolly
 

7945
02:18:08,639 --> 02:18:11,389
yeah I would like to have says the dolly
part where you provide a few words yeah

7946
02:18:11,389 --> 02:18:11,399
part where you provide a few words yeah
 

7947
02:18:11,399 --> 02:18:14,330
part where you provide a few words yeah
and it generates a painting so here you

7948
02:18:14,330 --> 02:18:14,340
and it generates a painting so here you
 

7949
02:18:14,340 --> 02:18:16,490
and it generates a painting so here you
say I want a frog

7950
02:18:16,490 --> 02:18:16,500
say I want a frog
 

7951
02:18:16,500 --> 02:18:20,750
say I want a frog
with these features and then it would go

7952
02:18:20,750 --> 02:18:20,760
with these features and then it would go
 

7953
02:18:20,760 --> 02:18:23,690
with these features and then it would go
direct a complex biological system to

7954
02:18:23,690 --> 02:18:23,700
direct a complex biological system to
 

7955
02:18:23,700 --> 02:18:26,030
direct a complex biological system to
construct something like that yeah the

7956
02:18:26,030 --> 02:18:26,040
construct something like that yeah the
 

7957
02:18:26,040 --> 02:18:28,129
construct something like that yeah the
main magic would be I mean I think from

7958
02:18:28,129 --> 02:18:28,139
main magic would be I mean I think from
 

7959
02:18:28,139 --> 02:18:30,230
main magic would be I mean I think from
from looking at Dali and so on it looks

7960
02:18:30,230 --> 02:18:30,240
from looking at Dali and so on it looks
 

7961
02:18:30,240 --> 02:18:31,790
from looking at Dali and so on it looks
like the first part is kind of solved

7962
02:18:31,790 --> 02:18:31,800
like the first part is kind of solved
 

7963
02:18:31,800 --> 02:18:33,589
like the first part is kind of solved
now where you go from from the words to

7964
02:18:33,589 --> 02:18:33,599
now where you go from from the words to
 

7965
02:18:33,599 --> 02:18:35,509
now where you go from from the words to
the image like that seems more or less

7966
02:18:35,509 --> 02:18:35,519
the image like that seems more or less
 

7967
02:18:35,519 --> 02:18:39,049
the image like that seems more or less
solved the next step is really hard this

7968
02:18:39,049 --> 02:18:39,059
solved the next step is really hard this
 

7969
02:18:39,059 --> 02:18:40,790
solved the next step is really hard this
is what keeps things like crispr and

7970
02:18:40,790 --> 02:18:40,800
is what keeps things like crispr and
 

7971
02:18:40,800 --> 02:18:42,770
is what keeps things like crispr and
genomic editing and so on it's good this

7972
02:18:42,770 --> 02:18:42,780
genomic editing and so on it's good this
 

7973
02:18:42,780 --> 02:18:44,509
genomic editing and so on it's good this
is what limits all the except

7974
02:18:44,509 --> 02:18:44,519
is what limits all the except
 

7975
02:18:44,519 --> 02:18:47,270
is what limits all the except
uh uh impacts for for gender medicine

7976
02:18:47,270 --> 02:18:47,280
uh uh impacts for for gender medicine
 

7977
02:18:47,280 --> 02:18:50,209
uh uh impacts for for gender medicine
because going back to okay this is the

7978
02:18:50,209 --> 02:18:50,219
because going back to okay this is the
 

7979
02:18:50,219 --> 02:18:51,589
because going back to okay this is the
knee joint that I want or this is the

7980
02:18:51,589 --> 02:18:51,599
knee joint that I want or this is the
 

7981
02:18:51,599 --> 02:18:52,790
knee joint that I want or this is the
eye that I want

7982
02:18:52,790 --> 02:18:52,800
eye that I want
 

7983
02:18:52,800 --> 02:18:55,009
eye that I want
now what genes do I edit to make that

7984
02:18:55,009 --> 02:18:55,019
now what genes do I edit to make that
 

7985
02:18:55,019 --> 02:18:56,509
now what genes do I edit to make that
happen right going back in that

7986
02:18:56,509 --> 02:18:56,519
happen right going back in that
 

7987
02:18:56,519 --> 02:18:58,310
happen right going back in that
direction is really hard so instead of

7988
02:18:58,310 --> 02:18:58,320
direction is really hard so instead of
 

7989
02:18:58,320 --> 02:18:59,690
direction is really hard so instead of
that it's going to be okay I understand

7990
02:18:59,690 --> 02:18:59,700
that it's going to be okay I understand
 

7991
02:18:59,700 --> 02:19:01,250
that it's going to be okay I understand
how to motivate cells to build

7992
02:19:01,250 --> 02:19:01,260
how to motivate cells to build
 

7993
02:19:01,260 --> 02:19:03,230
how to motivate cells to build
particular structures can I rewrite the

7994
02:19:03,230 --> 02:19:03,240
particular structures can I rewrite the
 

7995
02:19:03,240 --> 02:19:04,370
particular structures can I rewrite the
memory of what they think they're

7996
02:19:04,370 --> 02:19:04,380
memory of what they think they're
 

7997
02:19:04,380 --> 02:19:06,290
memory of what they think they're
supposed to be building such that then I

7998
02:19:06,290 --> 02:19:06,300
supposed to be building such that then I
 

7999
02:19:06,300 --> 02:19:07,910
supposed to be building such that then I
can you know take my hands off the wheel

8000
02:19:07,910 --> 02:19:07,920
can you know take my hands off the wheel
 

8001
02:19:07,920 --> 02:19:10,190
can you know take my hands off the wheel
and let them let them do their thing so

8002
02:19:10,190 --> 02:19:10,200
and let them let them do their thing so
 

8003
02:19:10,200 --> 02:19:12,110
and let them let them do their thing so
some of that is experiment but some of

8004
02:19:12,110 --> 02:19:12,120
some of that is experiment but some of
 

8005
02:19:12,120 --> 02:19:13,969
some of that is experiment but some of
that maybe AI can help too just like

8006
02:19:13,969 --> 02:19:13,979
that maybe AI can help too just like
 

8007
02:19:13,979 --> 02:19:16,490
that maybe AI can help too just like
with protein folding this is exactly the

8008
02:19:16,490 --> 02:19:16,500
with protein folding this is exactly the
 

8009
02:19:16,500 --> 02:19:19,969
with protein folding this is exactly the
problem that protein folding uh in in

8010
02:19:19,969 --> 02:19:19,979
problem that protein folding uh in in
 

8011
02:19:19,979 --> 02:19:22,030
problem that protein folding uh in in
the most simple

8012
02:19:22,030 --> 02:19:22,040
the most simple
 

8013
02:19:22,040 --> 02:19:26,270
the most simple
medium tried and has solved with Alpha

8014
02:19:26,270 --> 02:19:26,280
medium tried and has solved with Alpha
 

8015
02:19:26,280 --> 02:19:30,349
medium tried and has solved with Alpha
fold which is how does the sequence of

8016
02:19:30,349 --> 02:19:30,359
fold which is how does the sequence of
 

8017
02:19:30,359 --> 02:19:33,589
fold which is how does the sequence of
letters result in this three-dimensional

8018
02:19:33,589 --> 02:19:33,599
letters result in this three-dimensional
 

8019
02:19:33,599 --> 02:19:35,690
letters result in this three-dimensional
shape and you have to

8020
02:19:35,690 --> 02:19:35,700
shape and you have to
 

8021
02:19:35,700 --> 02:19:37,129
shape and you have to
um I guess it didn't solve it because

8022
02:19:37,129 --> 02:19:37,139
um I guess it didn't solve it because
 

8023
02:19:37,139 --> 02:19:38,450
um I guess it didn't solve it because
you have to

8024
02:19:38,450 --> 02:19:38,460
you have to
 

8025
02:19:38,460 --> 02:19:40,730
you have to
if you say I want this shape how do I

8026
02:19:40,730 --> 02:19:40,740
if you say I want this shape how do I
 

8027
02:19:40,740 --> 02:19:42,770
if you say I want this shape how do I
then have a sequence of letters

8028
02:19:42,770 --> 02:19:42,780
then have a sequence of letters
 

8029
02:19:42,780 --> 02:19:45,290
then have a sequence of letters
yeah the reverse engineering stuff is

8030
02:19:45,290 --> 02:19:45,300
yeah the reverse engineering stuff is
 

8031
02:19:45,300 --> 02:19:47,570
yeah the reverse engineering stuff is
really tricky it is I think I think

8032
02:19:47,570 --> 02:19:47,580
really tricky it is I think I think
 

8033
02:19:47,580 --> 02:19:49,370
really tricky it is I think I think
where where and we're doing some of this

8034
02:19:49,370 --> 02:19:49,380
where where and we're doing some of this
 

8035
02:19:49,380 --> 02:19:53,630
where where and we're doing some of this
now is is to uh use AI to try and uh

8036
02:19:53,630 --> 02:19:53,640
now is is to uh use AI to try and uh
 

8037
02:19:53,640 --> 02:19:55,910
now is is to uh use AI to try and uh
build actionable models of the

8038
02:19:55,910 --> 02:19:55,920
build actionable models of the
 

8039
02:19:55,920 --> 02:19:57,590
build actionable models of the
intelligence of the cellular collectives

8040
02:19:57,590 --> 02:19:57,600
intelligence of the cellular collectives
 

8041
02:19:57,600 --> 02:20:00,170
intelligence of the cellular collectives
so try to help us to help us gain models

8042
02:20:00,170 --> 02:20:00,180
so try to help us to help us gain models
 

8043
02:20:00,180 --> 02:20:01,550
so try to help us to help us gain models
that that

8044
02:20:01,550 --> 02:20:01,560
that that
 

8045
02:20:01,560 --> 02:20:02,990
that that
um and and we've had some success in

8046
02:20:02,990 --> 02:20:03,000
um and and we've had some success in
 

8047
02:20:03,000 --> 02:20:05,030
um and and we've had some success in
this so we did something like this for

8048
02:20:05,030 --> 02:20:05,040
this so we did something like this for
 

8049
02:20:05,040 --> 02:20:08,270
this so we did something like this for
um uh for you know for repairing uh

8050
02:20:08,270 --> 02:20:08,280
um uh for you know for repairing uh
 

8051
02:20:08,280 --> 02:20:10,490
um uh for you know for repairing uh
birth defects of the brain in frog we've

8052
02:20:10,490 --> 02:20:10,500
birth defects of the brain in frog we've
 

8053
02:20:10,500 --> 02:20:12,110
birth defects of the brain in frog we've
done some of this for um normalizing

8054
02:20:12,110 --> 02:20:12,120
done some of this for um normalizing
 

8055
02:20:12,120 --> 02:20:15,170
done some of this for um normalizing
melanoma uh where you can really start

8056
02:20:15,170 --> 02:20:15,180
melanoma uh where you can really start
 

8057
02:20:15,180 --> 02:20:18,710
melanoma uh where you can really start
to use AI to make models of how would I

8058
02:20:18,710 --> 02:20:18,720
to use AI to make models of how would I
 

8059
02:20:18,720 --> 02:20:20,690
to use AI to make models of how would I
impact this thing if I wanted to given

8060
02:20:20,690 --> 02:20:20,700
impact this thing if I wanted to given
 

8061
02:20:20,700 --> 02:20:23,090
impact this thing if I wanted to given
all the complexities right and and given

8062
02:20:23,090 --> 02:20:23,100
all the complexities right and and given
 

8063
02:20:23,100 --> 02:20:25,969
all the complexities right and and given
all the uh the the the controls that

8064
02:20:25,969 --> 02:20:25,979
all the uh the the the controls that
 

8065
02:20:25,979 --> 02:20:28,370
all the uh the the the controls that
that it knows how to do so when you say

8066
02:20:28,370 --> 02:20:28,380
that it knows how to do so when you say
 

8067
02:20:28,380 --> 02:20:32,030
that it knows how to do so when you say
regenerative medicine so we talked about

8068
02:20:32,030 --> 02:20:32,040
regenerative medicine so we talked about
 

8069
02:20:32,040 --> 02:20:35,210
regenerative medicine so we talked about
creating biological organisms but if you

8070
02:20:35,210 --> 02:20:35,220
creating biological organisms but if you
 

8071
02:20:35,220 --> 02:20:37,910
creating biological organisms but if you
regrow a hand that information is

8072
02:20:37,910 --> 02:20:37,920
regrow a hand that information is
 

8073
02:20:37,920 --> 02:20:39,469
regrow a hand that information is
already there

8074
02:20:39,469 --> 02:20:39,479
already there
 

8075
02:20:39,479 --> 02:20:41,990
already there
right the biological system has that

8076
02:20:41,990 --> 02:20:42,000
right the biological system has that
 

8077
02:20:42,000 --> 02:20:43,250
right the biological system has that
information

8078
02:20:43,250 --> 02:20:43,260
information
 

8079
02:20:43,260 --> 02:20:46,070
information
so how does regenerative medicine work

8080
02:20:46,070 --> 02:20:46,080
so how does regenerative medicine work
 

8081
02:20:46,080 --> 02:20:48,230
so how does regenerative medicine work
today how do you hope it works what's

8082
02:20:48,230 --> 02:20:48,240
today how do you hope it works what's
 

8083
02:20:48,240 --> 02:20:51,349
today how do you hope it works what's
the hope there yeah yeah how do you make

8084
02:20:51,349 --> 02:20:51,359
the hope there yeah yeah how do you make
 

8085
02:20:51,359 --> 02:20:54,290
the hope there yeah yeah how do you make
it happen well today there's a set of

8086
02:20:54,290 --> 02:20:54,300
it happen well today there's a set of
 

8087
02:20:54,300 --> 02:20:56,210
it happen well today there's a set of
popular approaches so so one is 3D

8088
02:20:56,210 --> 02:20:56,220
popular approaches so so one is 3D
 

8089
02:20:56,220 --> 02:20:58,070
popular approaches so so one is 3D
printing so the idea is I'm going to

8090
02:20:58,070 --> 02:20:58,080
printing so the idea is I'm going to
 

8091
02:20:58,080 --> 02:20:59,570
printing so the idea is I'm going to
make a scaffold of the thing that I want

8092
02:20:59,570 --> 02:20:59,580
make a scaffold of the thing that I want
 

8093
02:20:59,580 --> 02:21:01,070
make a scaffold of the thing that I want
I'm going to seed it with cells and then

8094
02:21:01,070 --> 02:21:01,080
I'm going to seed it with cells and then
 

8095
02:21:01,080 --> 02:21:02,450
I'm going to seed it with cells and then
and then there it is right so kind of

8096
02:21:02,450 --> 02:21:02,460
and then there it is right so kind of
 

8097
02:21:02,460 --> 02:21:03,830
and then there it is right so kind of
direct and then that works for certain

8098
02:21:03,830 --> 02:21:03,840
direct and then that works for certain
 

8099
02:21:03,840 --> 02:21:05,450
direct and then that works for certain
things you can make a bladder that way

8100
02:21:05,450 --> 02:21:05,460
things you can make a bladder that way
 

8101
02:21:05,460 --> 02:21:07,969
things you can make a bladder that way
or an ear or something like that

8102
02:21:07,969 --> 02:21:07,979
or an ear or something like that
 

8103
02:21:07,979 --> 02:21:10,490
or an ear or something like that
um the other the other ideas is some

8104
02:21:10,490 --> 02:21:10,500
um the other the other ideas is some
 

8105
02:21:10,500 --> 02:21:12,170
um the other the other ideas is some
sort of stem cell transplant into the

8106
02:21:12,170 --> 02:21:12,180
sort of stem cell transplant into the
 

8107
02:21:12,180 --> 02:21:14,809
sort of stem cell transplant into the
ideas if we uh if we put in stem cells

8108
02:21:14,809 --> 02:21:14,819
ideas if we uh if we put in stem cells
 

8109
02:21:14,819 --> 02:21:16,250
ideas if we uh if we put in stem cells
with appropriate factors we can get them

8110
02:21:16,250 --> 02:21:16,260
with appropriate factors we can get them
 

8111
02:21:16,260 --> 02:21:18,290
with appropriate factors we can get them
to generate certain kinds of neurons for

8112
02:21:18,290 --> 02:21:18,300
to generate certain kinds of neurons for
 

8113
02:21:18,300 --> 02:21:20,630
to generate certain kinds of neurons for
certain you know diseases and so on all

8114
02:21:20,630 --> 02:21:20,640
certain you know diseases and so on all
 

8115
02:21:20,640 --> 02:21:23,210
certain you know diseases and so on all
of those things are good for relatively

8116
02:21:23,210 --> 02:21:23,220
of those things are good for relatively
 

8117
02:21:23,220 --> 02:21:25,910
of those things are good for relatively
simple structures but when you want an

8118
02:21:25,910 --> 02:21:25,920
simple structures but when you want an
 

8119
02:21:25,920 --> 02:21:28,190
simple structures but when you want an
eye or a hand or something else I think

8120
02:21:28,190 --> 02:21:28,200
eye or a hand or something else I think
 

8121
02:21:28,200 --> 02:21:31,070
eye or a hand or something else I think
in this maybe an unpopular opinion I

8122
02:21:31,070 --> 02:21:31,080
in this maybe an unpopular opinion I
 

8123
02:21:31,080 --> 02:21:33,110
in this maybe an unpopular opinion I
think the only hope we have in any

8124
02:21:33,110 --> 02:21:33,120
think the only hope we have in any
 

8125
02:21:33,120 --> 02:21:35,510
think the only hope we have in any
reasonable kind of time frame is to

8126
02:21:35,510 --> 02:21:35,520
reasonable kind of time frame is to
 

8127
02:21:35,520 --> 02:21:38,150
reasonable kind of time frame is to
understand how the thing was motivated

8128
02:21:38,150 --> 02:21:38,160
understand how the thing was motivated
 

8129
02:21:38,160 --> 02:21:40,250
understand how the thing was motivated
to get made in the first place so what

8130
02:21:40,250 --> 02:21:40,260
to get made in the first place so what
 

8131
02:21:40,260 --> 02:21:42,469
to get made in the first place so what
is it that that made those cells in the

8132
02:21:42,469 --> 02:21:42,479
is it that that made those cells in the
 

8133
02:21:42,479 --> 02:21:44,450
is it that that made those cells in the
in the beginning create a particular arm

8134
02:21:44,450 --> 02:21:44,460
in the beginning create a particular arm
 

8135
02:21:44,460 --> 02:21:48,230
in the beginning create a particular arm
with a particular uh set of sizes and

8136
02:21:48,230 --> 02:21:48,240
with a particular uh set of sizes and
 

8137
02:21:48,240 --> 02:21:49,610
with a particular uh set of sizes and
shapes and number of fingers and all

8138
02:21:49,610 --> 02:21:49,620
shapes and number of fingers and all
 

8139
02:21:49,620 --> 02:21:51,230
shapes and number of fingers and all
that and why is it that a salamander can

8140
02:21:51,230 --> 02:21:51,240
that and why is it that a salamander can
 

8141
02:21:51,240 --> 02:21:52,670
that and why is it that a salamander can
keep losing theirs and keep regrowing

8142
02:21:52,670 --> 02:21:52,680
keep losing theirs and keep regrowing
 

8143
02:21:52,680 --> 02:21:54,650
keep losing theirs and keep regrowing
theirs and a planarian can do the same

8144
02:21:54,650 --> 02:21:54,660
theirs and a planarian can do the same
 

8145
02:21:54,660 --> 02:21:58,370
theirs and a planarian can do the same
even more so to me a kind of ultimate

8146
02:21:58,370 --> 02:21:58,380
even more so to me a kind of ultimate
 

8147
02:21:58,380 --> 02:22:01,010
even more so to me a kind of ultimate
regenerative medicine was when you can

8148
02:22:01,010 --> 02:22:01,020
regenerative medicine was when you can
 

8149
02:22:01,020 --> 02:22:03,050
regenerative medicine was when you can
tell the cells to build whatever it is

8150
02:22:03,050 --> 02:22:03,060
tell the cells to build whatever it is
 

8151
02:22:03,060 --> 02:22:05,389
tell the cells to build whatever it is
you need them to build right and so so

8152
02:22:05,389 --> 02:22:05,399
you need them to build right and so so
 

8153
02:22:05,399 --> 02:22:07,010
you need them to build right and so so
that we can all be like planarian

8154
02:22:07,010 --> 02:22:07,020
that we can all be like planarian
 

8155
02:22:07,020 --> 02:22:09,290
that we can all be like planarian
basically do you have to start at the

8156
02:22:09,290 --> 02:22:09,300
basically do you have to start at the
 

8157
02:22:09,300 --> 02:22:11,870
basically do you have to start at the
very beginning or can you um

8158
02:22:11,870 --> 02:22:11,880
very beginning or can you um
 

8159
02:22:11,880 --> 02:22:15,230
very beginning or can you um
do a shortcut okay throwing a hand

8160
02:22:15,230 --> 02:22:15,240
do a shortcut okay throwing a hand
 

8161
02:22:15,240 --> 02:22:18,110
do a shortcut okay throwing a hand
you already got the whole organism yeah

8162
02:22:18,110 --> 02:22:18,120
you already got the whole organism yeah
 

8163
02:22:18,120 --> 02:22:19,670
you already got the whole organism yeah
so here's what we've done right so so

8164
02:22:19,670 --> 02:22:19,680
so here's what we've done right so so
 

8165
02:22:19,680 --> 02:22:21,830
so here's what we've done right so so
we've we've more or less solved that in

8166
02:22:21,830 --> 02:22:21,840
we've we've more or less solved that in
 

8167
02:22:21,840 --> 02:22:23,809
we've we've more or less solved that in
frog so frogs unlike salamanders do not

8168
02:22:23,809 --> 02:22:23,819
frog so frogs unlike salamanders do not
 

8169
02:22:23,819 --> 02:22:25,969
frog so frogs unlike salamanders do not
regenerate their legs as adults and so

8170
02:22:25,969 --> 02:22:25,979
regenerate their legs as adults and so
 

8171
02:22:25,979 --> 02:22:30,530
regenerate their legs as adults and so
so uh We've shown that with a very um uh

8172
02:22:30,530 --> 02:22:30,540
so uh We've shown that with a very um uh
 

8173
02:22:30,540 --> 02:22:32,630
so uh We've shown that with a very um uh
kind of simple intervention so what we

8174
02:22:32,630 --> 02:22:32,640
kind of simple intervention so what we
 

8175
02:22:32,640 --> 02:22:35,510
kind of simple intervention so what we
do is there's two things you need to uh

8176
02:22:35,510 --> 02:22:35,520
do is there's two things you need to uh
 

8177
02:22:35,520 --> 02:22:37,190
do is there's two things you need to uh
you need to have a signal that tells the

8178
02:22:37,190 --> 02:22:37,200
you need to have a signal that tells the
 

8179
02:22:37,200 --> 02:22:38,750
you need to have a signal that tells the
cells what to do and then you need some

8180
02:22:38,750 --> 02:22:38,760
cells what to do and then you need some
 

8181
02:22:38,760 --> 02:22:40,550
cells what to do and then you need some
way of delivering it and so this is work

8182
02:22:40,550 --> 02:22:40,560
way of delivering it and so this is work
 

8183
02:22:40,560 --> 02:22:42,290
way of delivering it and so this is work
together with them with David Kaplan and

8184
02:22:42,290 --> 02:22:42,300
together with them with David Kaplan and
 

8185
02:22:42,300 --> 02:22:44,510
together with them with David Kaplan and
I should do a disclosure here we have a

8186
02:22:44,510 --> 02:22:44,520
I should do a disclosure here we have a
 

8187
02:22:44,520 --> 02:22:45,710
I should do a disclosure here we have a
company called morpheuticals and

8188
02:22:45,710 --> 02:22:45,720
company called morpheuticals and
 

8189
02:22:45,720 --> 02:22:48,349
company called morpheuticals and
spin-off where we're trying to uh to

8190
02:22:48,349 --> 02:22:48,359
spin-off where we're trying to uh to
 

8191
02:22:48,359 --> 02:22:50,630
spin-off where we're trying to uh to
address uh regenerate you know limb

8192
02:22:50,630 --> 02:22:50,640
address uh regenerate you know limb
 

8193
02:22:50,640 --> 02:22:52,250
address uh regenerate you know limb
regeneration so we've solved it in the

8194
02:22:52,250 --> 02:22:52,260
regeneration so we've solved it in the
 

8195
02:22:52,260 --> 02:22:54,590
regeneration so we've solved it in the
Frog and we're now in trials and mice so

8196
02:22:54,590 --> 02:22:54,600
Frog and we're now in trials and mice so
 

8197
02:22:54,600 --> 02:22:56,150
Frog and we're now in trials and mice so
now we're going we're in mammals now and

8198
02:22:56,150 --> 02:22:56,160
now we're going we're in mammals now and
 

8199
02:22:56,160 --> 02:22:57,349
now we're going we're in mammals now and
I can't say anything about how it's

8200
02:22:57,349 --> 02:22:57,359
I can't say anything about how it's
 

8201
02:22:57,359 --> 02:22:58,969
I can't say anything about how it's
going but the Frog thing is solved so

8202
02:22:58,969 --> 02:22:58,979
going but the Frog thing is solved so
 

8203
02:22:58,979 --> 02:23:00,889
going but the Frog thing is solved so
what you do is um after you have a

8204
02:23:00,889 --> 02:23:00,899
what you do is um after you have a
 

8205
02:23:00,899 --> 02:23:02,990
what you do is um after you have a
little frog Luke Skywalker with every

8206
02:23:02,990 --> 02:23:03,000
little frog Luke Skywalker with every
 

8207
02:23:03,000 --> 02:23:04,790
little frog Luke Skywalker with every
growing hand yeah basically basically

8208
02:23:04,790 --> 02:23:04,800
growing hand yeah basically basically
 

8209
02:23:04,800 --> 02:23:06,590
growing hand yeah basically basically
yeah yeah so what you do is we did it

8210
02:23:06,590 --> 02:23:06,600
yeah yeah so what you do is we did it
 

8211
02:23:06,600 --> 02:23:08,090
yeah yeah so what you do is we did it
with legs instead of forearms and what

8212
02:23:08,090 --> 02:23:08,100
with legs instead of forearms and what
 

8213
02:23:08,100 --> 02:23:09,889
with legs instead of forearms and what
you do is after amputation normally they

8214
02:23:09,889 --> 02:23:09,899
you do is after amputation normally they
 

8215
02:23:09,899 --> 02:23:11,870
you do is after amputation normally they
they don't regenerate you put on a

8216
02:23:11,870 --> 02:23:11,880
they don't regenerate you put on a
 

8217
02:23:11,880 --> 02:23:13,790
they don't regenerate you put on a
wearable bioreactor so it's this thing

8218
02:23:13,790 --> 02:23:13,800
wearable bioreactor so it's this thing
 

8219
02:23:13,800 --> 02:23:16,429
wearable bioreactor so it's this thing
that um that goes on and Dave kaplan's

8220
02:23:16,429 --> 02:23:16,439
that um that goes on and Dave kaplan's
 

8221
02:23:16,439 --> 02:23:19,550
that um that goes on and Dave kaplan's
lab makes these things and inside it's a

8222
02:23:19,550 --> 02:23:19,560
lab makes these things and inside it's a
 

8223
02:23:19,560 --> 02:23:21,710
lab makes these things and inside it's a
it's a very controlled environment it is

8224
02:23:21,710 --> 02:23:21,720
it's a very controlled environment it is
 

8225
02:23:21,720 --> 02:23:24,050
it's a very controlled environment it is
a silk gel that carries uh some drugs

8226
02:23:24,050 --> 02:23:24,060
a silk gel that carries uh some drugs
 

8227
02:23:24,060 --> 02:23:26,389
a silk gel that carries uh some drugs
for example ION channel drugs and what

8228
02:23:26,389 --> 02:23:26,399
for example ION channel drugs and what
 

8229
02:23:26,399 --> 02:23:27,710
for example ION channel drugs and what
you're doing is you're saying to these

8230
02:23:27,710 --> 02:23:27,720
you're doing is you're saying to these
 

8231
02:23:27,720 --> 02:23:28,730
you're doing is you're saying to these
cells

8232
02:23:28,730 --> 02:23:28,740
cells
 

8233
02:23:28,740 --> 02:23:31,250
cells
you should regrow what normally goes

8234
02:23:31,250 --> 02:23:31,260
you should regrow what normally goes
 

8235
02:23:31,260 --> 02:23:35,030
you should regrow what normally goes
here so uh that whole thing is on for 24

8236
02:23:35,030 --> 02:23:35,040
here so uh that whole thing is on for 24
 

8237
02:23:35,040 --> 02:23:36,889
here so uh that whole thing is on for 24
hours then you take it off you don't

8238
02:23:36,889 --> 02:23:36,899
hours then you take it off you don't
 

8239
02:23:36,899 --> 02:23:38,150
hours then you take it off you don't
touch the leg again this is really

8240
02:23:38,150 --> 02:23:38,160
touch the leg again this is really
 

8241
02:23:38,160 --> 02:23:39,650
touch the leg again this is really
important because what we're not looking

8242
02:23:39,650 --> 02:23:39,660
important because what we're not looking
 

8243
02:23:39,660 --> 02:23:42,410
important because what we're not looking
for is a set of micromanagement you know

8244
02:23:42,410 --> 02:23:42,420
for is a set of micromanagement you know
 

8245
02:23:42,420 --> 02:23:44,330
for is a set of micromanagement you know
printing or controlling the cells we

8246
02:23:44,330 --> 02:23:44,340
printing or controlling the cells we
 

8247
02:23:44,340 --> 02:23:45,830
printing or controlling the cells we
want to trigger we want to we want to

8248
02:23:45,830 --> 02:23:45,840
want to trigger we want to we want to
 

8249
02:23:45,840 --> 02:23:47,630
want to trigger we want to we want to
interact with it early on and then not

8250
02:23:47,630 --> 02:23:47,640
interact with it early on and then not
 

8251
02:23:47,640 --> 02:23:49,250
interact with it early on and then not
touch it again because because we don't

8252
02:23:49,250 --> 02:23:49,260
touch it again because because we don't
 

8253
02:23:49,260 --> 02:23:50,690
touch it again because because we don't
know how to make a frog leg but the Frog

8254
02:23:50,690 --> 02:23:50,700
know how to make a frog leg but the Frog
 

8255
02:23:50,700 --> 02:23:53,809
know how to make a frog leg but the Frog
knows how to make a frog leg so 24 hours

8256
02:23:53,809 --> 02:23:53,819
knows how to make a frog leg so 24 hours
 

8257
02:23:53,819 --> 02:23:56,150
knows how to make a frog leg so 24 hours
18 months of leg growth after that

8258
02:23:56,150 --> 02:23:56,160
18 months of leg growth after that
 

8259
02:23:56,160 --> 02:23:57,710
18 months of leg growth after that
without us touching it again and after

8260
02:23:57,710 --> 02:23:57,720
without us touching it again and after
 

8261
02:23:57,720 --> 02:23:59,929
without us touching it again and after
18 months you get a pretty good leg that

8262
02:23:59,929 --> 02:23:59,939
18 months you get a pretty good leg that
 

8263
02:23:59,939 --> 02:24:01,730
18 months you get a pretty good leg that
kind of shows this proof of concept that

8264
02:24:01,730 --> 02:24:01,740
kind of shows this proof of concept that
 

8265
02:24:01,740 --> 02:24:02,990
kind of shows this proof of concept that
early on when the cells right after

8266
02:24:02,990 --> 02:24:03,000
early on when the cells right after
 

8267
02:24:03,000 --> 02:24:04,550
early on when the cells right after
injury when they're first making a

8268
02:24:04,550 --> 02:24:04,560
injury when they're first making a
 

8269
02:24:04,560 --> 02:24:05,570
injury when they're first making a
decision about what they're going to do

8270
02:24:05,570 --> 02:24:05,580
decision about what they're going to do
 

8271
02:24:05,580 --> 02:24:07,370
decision about what they're going to do
you can you can impact them and once

8272
02:24:07,370 --> 02:24:07,380
you can you can impact them and once
 

8273
02:24:07,380 --> 02:24:08,870
you can you can impact them and once
they've decided to make a leg they don't

8274
02:24:08,870 --> 02:24:08,880
they've decided to make a leg they don't
 

8275
02:24:08,880 --> 02:24:10,910
they've decided to make a leg they don't
need you after that they can you know do

8276
02:24:10,910 --> 02:24:10,920
need you after that they can you know do
 

8277
02:24:10,920 --> 02:24:12,889
need you after that they can you know do
their own thing so that's an approach

8278
02:24:12,889 --> 02:24:12,899
their own thing so that's an approach
 

8279
02:24:12,899 --> 02:24:14,690
their own thing so that's an approach
that we're now taking what about cancer

8280
02:24:14,690 --> 02:24:14,700
that we're now taking what about cancer
 

8281
02:24:14,700 --> 02:24:16,670
that we're now taking what about cancer
suppression that's something you

8282
02:24:16,670 --> 02:24:16,680
suppression that's something you
 

8283
02:24:16,680 --> 02:24:18,770
suppression that's something you
mentioned earlier how can all of these

8284
02:24:18,770 --> 02:24:18,780
mentioned earlier how can all of these
 

8285
02:24:18,780 --> 02:24:20,570
mentioned earlier how can all of these
ideas help with cancer suppression so

8286
02:24:20,570 --> 02:24:20,580
ideas help with cancer suppression so
 

8287
02:24:20,580 --> 02:24:21,710
ideas help with cancer suppression so
let's let's go back to the beginning and

8288
02:24:21,710 --> 02:24:21,720
let's let's go back to the beginning and
 

8289
02:24:21,720 --> 02:24:23,870
let's let's go back to the beginning and
ask what what what what cancer is so I

8290
02:24:23,870 --> 02:24:23,880
ask what what what what cancer is so I
 

8291
02:24:23,880 --> 02:24:26,210
ask what what what what cancer is so I
think um you know asking why there's

8292
02:24:26,210 --> 02:24:26,220
think um you know asking why there's
 

8293
02:24:26,220 --> 02:24:28,190
think um you know asking why there's
cancer is the wrong question I think the

8294
02:24:28,190 --> 02:24:28,200
cancer is the wrong question I think the
 

8295
02:24:28,200 --> 02:24:29,510
cancer is the wrong question I think the
right question is why is there ever

8296
02:24:29,510 --> 02:24:29,520
right question is why is there ever
 

8297
02:24:29,520 --> 02:24:32,630
right question is why is there ever
anything but cancer so so in the normal

8298
02:24:32,630 --> 02:24:32,640
anything but cancer so so in the normal
 

8299
02:24:32,640 --> 02:24:34,730
anything but cancer so so in the normal
State you have a bunch of cells that are

8300
02:24:34,730 --> 02:24:34,740
State you have a bunch of cells that are
 

8301
02:24:34,740 --> 02:24:36,469
State you have a bunch of cells that are
all cooperating towards a large-scale

8302
02:24:36,469 --> 02:24:36,479
all cooperating towards a large-scale
 

8303
02:24:36,479 --> 02:24:38,690
all cooperating towards a large-scale
goal if that process of cooperation

8304
02:24:38,690 --> 02:24:38,700
goal if that process of cooperation
 

8305
02:24:38,700 --> 02:24:40,790
goal if that process of cooperation
breaks down and you've got a cell that

8306
02:24:40,790 --> 02:24:40,800
breaks down and you've got a cell that
 

8307
02:24:40,800 --> 02:24:42,650
breaks down and you've got a cell that
is isolated from that electrical Network

8308
02:24:42,650 --> 02:24:42,660
is isolated from that electrical Network
 

8309
02:24:42,660 --> 02:24:44,450
is isolated from that electrical Network
that lets you remember what the big goal

8310
02:24:44,450 --> 02:24:44,460
that lets you remember what the big goal
 

8311
02:24:44,460 --> 02:24:46,790
that lets you remember what the big goal
is you revert back to your unicellular

8312
02:24:46,790 --> 02:24:46,800
is you revert back to your unicellular
 

8313
02:24:46,800 --> 02:24:48,590
is you revert back to your unicellular
lifestyle as far as now think about that

8314
02:24:48,590 --> 02:24:48,600
lifestyle as far as now think about that
 

8315
02:24:48,600 --> 02:24:50,270
lifestyle as far as now think about that
border between self and world right

8316
02:24:50,270 --> 02:24:50,280
border between self and world right
 

8317
02:24:50,280 --> 02:24:51,530
border between self and world right
normally when all these cells are

8318
02:24:51,530 --> 02:24:51,540
normally when all these cells are
 

8319
02:24:51,540 --> 02:24:52,969
normally when all these cells are
connected by gab Junctions into an

8320
02:24:52,969 --> 02:24:52,979
connected by gab Junctions into an
 

8321
02:24:52,979 --> 02:24:56,270
connected by gab Junctions into an
electrical Network they are all one self

8322
02:24:56,270 --> 02:24:56,280
electrical Network they are all one self
 

8323
02:24:56,280 --> 02:24:59,929
electrical Network they are all one self
right meaning that um their goals they

8324
02:24:59,929 --> 02:24:59,939
right meaning that um their goals they
 

8325
02:24:59,939 --> 02:25:01,730
right meaning that um their goals they
have these large tissue level goals and

8326
02:25:01,730 --> 02:25:01,740
have these large tissue level goals and
 

8327
02:25:01,740 --> 02:25:03,050
have these large tissue level goals and
so on as soon as the cell is

8328
02:25:03,050 --> 02:25:03,060
so on as soon as the cell is
 

8329
02:25:03,060 --> 02:25:05,809
so on as soon as the cell is
disconnected from that the self is Tiny

8330
02:25:05,809 --> 02:25:05,819
disconnected from that the self is Tiny
 

8331
02:25:05,819 --> 02:25:07,750
disconnected from that the self is Tiny
right and so at that point and so so

8332
02:25:07,750 --> 02:25:07,760
right and so at that point and so so
 

8333
02:25:07,760 --> 02:25:10,309
right and so at that point and so so
people a lot of people model cancer cell

8334
02:25:10,309 --> 02:25:10,319
people a lot of people model cancer cell
 

8335
02:25:10,319 --> 02:25:12,110
people a lot of people model cancer cell
cells as being more selfish and all that

8336
02:25:12,110 --> 02:25:12,120
cells as being more selfish and all that
 

8337
02:25:12,120 --> 02:25:13,309
cells as being more selfish and all that
they're not more selfish they're equally

8338
02:25:13,309 --> 02:25:13,319
they're not more selfish they're equally
 

8339
02:25:13,319 --> 02:25:14,630
they're not more selfish they're equally
selfish it's just that their self is

8340
02:25:14,630 --> 02:25:14,640
selfish it's just that their self is
 

8341
02:25:14,640 --> 02:25:16,550
selfish it's just that their self is
smaller normally the self is huge now

8342
02:25:16,550 --> 02:25:16,560
smaller normally the self is huge now
 

8343
02:25:16,560 --> 02:25:18,230
smaller normally the self is huge now
they got tiny little selves now what are

8344
02:25:18,230 --> 02:25:18,240
they got tiny little selves now what are
 

8345
02:25:18,240 --> 02:25:19,849
they got tiny little selves now what are
the goals of tiny little selves well

8346
02:25:19,849 --> 02:25:19,859
the goals of tiny little selves well
 

8347
02:25:19,859 --> 02:25:21,889
the goals of tiny little selves well
proliferate right and migrate to

8348
02:25:21,889 --> 02:25:21,899
proliferate right and migrate to
 

8349
02:25:21,899 --> 02:25:22,910
proliferate right and migrate to
wherever life is good and that's

8350
02:25:22,910 --> 02:25:22,920
wherever life is good and that's
 

8351
02:25:22,920 --> 02:25:24,469
wherever life is good and that's
metastasis so that's proliferation of

8352
02:25:24,469 --> 02:25:24,479
metastasis so that's proliferation of
 

8353
02:25:24,479 --> 02:25:27,110
metastasis so that's proliferation of
metastasis so so one thing we found and

8354
02:25:27,110 --> 02:25:27,120
metastasis so so one thing we found and
 

8355
02:25:27,120 --> 02:25:29,630
metastasis so so one thing we found and
people have noticed years ago that when

8356
02:25:29,630 --> 02:25:29,640
people have noticed years ago that when
 

8357
02:25:29,640 --> 02:25:31,969
people have noticed years ago that when
cells convert to cancer the first thing

8358
02:25:31,969 --> 02:25:31,979
cells convert to cancer the first thing
 

8359
02:25:31,979 --> 02:25:33,830
cells convert to cancer the first thing
they see is they close the gap Junctions

8360
02:25:33,830 --> 02:25:33,840
they see is they close the gap Junctions
 

8361
02:25:33,840 --> 02:25:36,050
they see is they close the gap Junctions
and it's a lot like I think it's a lot

8362
02:25:36,050 --> 02:25:36,060
and it's a lot like I think it's a lot
 

8363
02:25:36,060 --> 02:25:37,610
and it's a lot like I think it's a lot
like that experiment with the slime mold

8364
02:25:37,610 --> 02:25:37,620
like that experiment with the slime mold
 

8365
02:25:37,620 --> 02:25:39,770
like that experiment with the slime mold
where until you close that Gap Junction

8366
02:25:39,770 --> 02:25:39,780
where until you close that Gap Junction
 

8367
02:25:39,780 --> 02:25:42,290
where until you close that Gap Junction
you can't even entertain the idea of

8368
02:25:42,290 --> 02:25:42,300
you can't even entertain the idea of
 

8369
02:25:42,300 --> 02:25:43,550
you can't even entertain the idea of
leaving the collective because there is

8370
02:25:43,550 --> 02:25:43,560
leaving the collective because there is
 

8371
02:25:43,560 --> 02:25:44,990
leaving the collective because there is
no you at that point right your mind

8372
02:25:44,990 --> 02:25:45,000
no you at that point right your mind
 

8373
02:25:45,000 --> 02:25:46,610
no you at that point right your mind
melded with this with this whole other

8374
02:25:46,610 --> 02:25:46,620
melded with this with this whole other
 

8375
02:25:46,620 --> 02:25:48,170
melded with this with this whole other
network but as soon as the Gap Junction

8376
02:25:48,170 --> 02:25:48,180
network but as soon as the Gap Junction
 

8377
02:25:48,180 --> 02:25:51,290
network but as soon as the Gap Junction
is closed now the boundary between you

8378
02:25:51,290 --> 02:25:51,300
is closed now the boundary between you
 

8379
02:25:51,300 --> 02:25:52,910
is closed now the boundary between you
now now the rest of the body is just

8380
02:25:52,910 --> 02:25:52,920
now now the rest of the body is just
 

8381
02:25:52,920 --> 02:25:54,710
now now the rest of the body is just
outside environment to you you're just a

8382
02:25:54,710 --> 02:25:54,720
outside environment to you you're just a
 

8383
02:25:54,720 --> 02:25:56,929
outside environment to you you're just a
you're just a unicellular organism on

8384
02:25:56,929 --> 02:25:56,939
you're just a unicellular organism on
 

8385
02:25:56,939 --> 02:25:59,630
you're just a unicellular organism on
the rest of the body's environment so so

8386
02:25:59,630 --> 02:25:59,640
the rest of the body's environment so so
 

8387
02:25:59,640 --> 02:26:01,790
the rest of the body's environment so so
we so we study this process and we

8388
02:26:01,790 --> 02:26:01,800
we so we study this process and we
 

8389
02:26:01,800 --> 02:26:04,370
we so we study this process and we
worked out a way to artificially control

8390
02:26:04,370 --> 02:26:04,380
worked out a way to artificially control
 

8391
02:26:04,380 --> 02:26:06,710
worked out a way to artificially control
troll the bioelectric state of these

8392
02:26:06,710 --> 02:26:06,720
troll the bioelectric state of these
 

8393
02:26:06,720 --> 02:26:09,050
troll the bioelectric state of these
cells to physically force them to remain

8394
02:26:09,050 --> 02:26:09,060
cells to physically force them to remain
 

8395
02:26:09,060 --> 02:26:11,210
cells to physically force them to remain
in that Network and so then then what

8396
02:26:11,210 --> 02:26:11,220
in that Network and so then then what
 

8397
02:26:11,220 --> 02:26:13,690
in that Network and so then then what
that what that means is that nasty

8398
02:26:13,690 --> 02:26:13,700
that what that means is that nasty
 

8399
02:26:13,700 --> 02:26:15,830
that what that means is that nasty
mutations like k-ras and things like

8400
02:26:15,830 --> 02:26:15,840
mutations like k-ras and things like
 

8401
02:26:15,840 --> 02:26:16,910
mutations like k-ras and things like
that these are these really tough

8402
02:26:16,910 --> 02:26:16,920
that these are these really tough
 

8403
02:26:16,920 --> 02:26:19,490
that these are these really tough
oncogenic mutations that cause tumors if

8404
02:26:19,490 --> 02:26:19,500
oncogenic mutations that cause tumors if
 

8405
02:26:19,500 --> 02:26:22,250
oncogenic mutations that cause tumors if
you if you do them and then but but then

8406
02:26:22,250 --> 02:26:22,260
you if you do them and then but but then
 

8407
02:26:22,260 --> 02:26:25,730
you if you do them and then but but then
but then artificially um uh control of

8408
02:26:25,730 --> 02:26:25,740
but then artificially um uh control of
 

8409
02:26:25,740 --> 02:26:28,490
but then artificially um uh control of
the bioelectrics you you you greatly

8410
02:26:28,490 --> 02:26:28,500
the bioelectrics you you you greatly
 

8411
02:26:28,500 --> 02:26:31,309
the bioelectrics you you you greatly
reduce tumor Genesis or or normalized

8412
02:26:31,309 --> 02:26:31,319
reduce tumor Genesis or or normalized
 

8413
02:26:31,319 --> 02:26:33,050
reduce tumor Genesis or or normalized
cells that had already begun to convert

8414
02:26:33,050 --> 02:26:33,060
cells that had already begun to convert
 

8415
02:26:33,060 --> 02:26:34,190
cells that had already begun to convert
to basically they go back to being

8416
02:26:34,190 --> 02:26:34,200
to basically they go back to being
 

8417
02:26:34,200 --> 02:26:36,950
to basically they go back to being
normal cells and so this is another much

8418
02:26:36,950 --> 02:26:36,960
normal cells and so this is another much
 

8419
02:26:36,960 --> 02:26:38,150
normal cells and so this is another much
like with the planaria this is another

8420
02:26:38,150 --> 02:26:38,160
like with the planaria this is another
 

8421
02:26:38,160 --> 02:26:40,730
like with the planaria this is another
way in which the bioelectric state uh

8422
02:26:40,730 --> 02:26:40,740
way in which the bioelectric state uh
 

8423
02:26:40,740 --> 02:26:43,010
way in which the bioelectric state uh
kind of uh dominates what the what the

8424
02:26:43,010 --> 02:26:43,020
kind of uh dominates what the what the
 

8425
02:26:43,020 --> 02:26:44,750
kind of uh dominates what the what the
genetic state is so if you sequence the

8426
02:26:44,750 --> 02:26:44,760
genetic state is so if you sequence the
 

8427
02:26:44,760 --> 02:26:46,730
genetic state is so if you sequence the
the you know if you sequence the nucleic

8428
02:26:46,730 --> 02:26:46,740
the you know if you sequence the nucleic
 

8429
02:26:46,740 --> 02:26:48,110
the you know if you sequence the nucleic
acids you'll see the k-aras mutation

8430
02:26:48,110 --> 02:26:48,120
acids you'll see the k-aras mutation
 

8431
02:26:48,120 --> 02:26:49,250
acids you'll see the k-aras mutation
you'll say ah well that's going to be a

8432
02:26:49,250 --> 02:26:49,260
you'll say ah well that's going to be a
 

8433
02:26:49,260 --> 02:26:51,230
you'll say ah well that's going to be a
tumor but there isn't a tumor because

8434
02:26:51,230 --> 02:26:51,240
tumor but there isn't a tumor because
 

8435
02:26:51,240 --> 02:26:52,849
tumor but there isn't a tumor because
because biologically you've kept the

8436
02:26:52,849 --> 02:26:52,859
because biologically you've kept the
 

8437
02:26:52,859 --> 02:26:54,230
because biologically you've kept the
cells connected and they're just working

8438
02:26:54,230 --> 02:26:54,240
cells connected and they're just working
 

8439
02:26:54,240 --> 02:26:56,330
cells connected and they're just working
on making nice skin and kidneys and

8440
02:26:56,330 --> 02:26:56,340
on making nice skin and kidneys and
 

8441
02:26:56,340 --> 02:26:58,849
on making nice skin and kidneys and
whatever else so so we've started moving

8442
02:26:58,849 --> 02:26:58,859
whatever else so so we've started moving
 

8443
02:26:58,859 --> 02:27:01,309
whatever else so so we've started moving
that to um to to human glioblastoma

8444
02:27:01,309 --> 02:27:01,319
that to um to to human glioblastoma
 

8445
02:27:01,319 --> 02:27:03,530
that to um to to human glioblastoma
cells and we're hoping for um you know a

8446
02:27:03,530 --> 02:27:03,540
cells and we're hoping for um you know a
 

8447
02:27:03,540 --> 02:27:05,270
cells and we're hoping for um you know a
patient in the future um interaction

8448
02:27:05,270 --> 02:27:05,280
patient in the future um interaction
 

8449
02:27:05,280 --> 02:27:08,110
patient in the future um interaction
with patients foreign

8450
02:27:08,110 --> 02:27:08,120
with patients foreign
 

8451
02:27:08,120 --> 02:27:11,750
with patients foreign
possible ways in which we may quote uh

8452
02:27:11,750 --> 02:27:11,760
possible ways in which we may quote uh
 

8453
02:27:11,760 --> 02:27:14,330
possible ways in which we may quote uh
cure cancer I think so yeah I think so I

8454
02:27:14,330 --> 02:27:14,340
cure cancer I think so yeah I think so I
 

8455
02:27:14,340 --> 02:27:16,190
cure cancer I think so yeah I think so I
think I think the actual cure I mean

8456
02:27:16,190 --> 02:27:16,200
think I think the actual cure I mean
 

8457
02:27:16,200 --> 02:27:17,450
think I think the actual cure I mean
there are other technology you know

8458
02:27:17,450 --> 02:27:17,460
there are other technology you know
 

8459
02:27:17,460 --> 02:27:19,370
there are other technology you know
immune therapy I think it's a great um

8460
02:27:19,370 --> 02:27:19,380
immune therapy I think it's a great um
 

8461
02:27:19,380 --> 02:27:20,630
immune therapy I think it's a great um
technology

8462
02:27:20,630 --> 02:27:20,640
technology
 

8463
02:27:20,640 --> 02:27:22,429
technology
um chemotherapy I don't think is a good

8464
02:27:22,429 --> 02:27:22,439
um chemotherapy I don't think is a good
 

8465
02:27:22,439 --> 02:27:24,410
um chemotherapy I don't think is a good
is a good technology I think we got to

8466
02:27:24,410 --> 02:27:24,420
is a good technology I think we got to
 

8467
02:27:24,420 --> 02:27:26,570
is a good technology I think we got to
get out get off of that so chemotherapy

8468
02:27:26,570 --> 02:27:26,580
get out get off of that so chemotherapy
 

8469
02:27:26,580 --> 02:27:29,750
get out get off of that so chemotherapy
just kills cells yeah well chemotherapy

8470
02:27:29,750 --> 02:27:29,760
just kills cells yeah well chemotherapy
 

8471
02:27:29,760 --> 02:27:32,090
just kills cells yeah well chemotherapy
uh hopes to kill more of the tumor cells

8472
02:27:32,090 --> 02:27:32,100
uh hopes to kill more of the tumor cells
 

8473
02:27:32,100 --> 02:27:33,650
uh hopes to kill more of the tumor cells
than of your cells that's it it's a fine

8474
02:27:33,650 --> 02:27:33,660
than of your cells that's it it's a fine
 

8475
02:27:33,660 --> 02:27:35,450
than of your cells that's it it's a fine
balance the the problem is the cells are

8476
02:27:35,450 --> 02:27:35,460
balance the the problem is the cells are
 

8477
02:27:35,460 --> 02:27:36,950
balance the the problem is the cells are
very similar because they are yourselves

8478
02:27:36,950 --> 02:27:36,960
very similar because they are yourselves
 

8479
02:27:36,960 --> 02:27:40,070
very similar because they are yourselves
and so if you don't have a very tight

8480
02:27:40,070 --> 02:27:40,080
and so if you don't have a very tight
 

8481
02:27:40,080 --> 02:27:42,590
and so if you don't have a very tight
way of distinguishing between them then

8482
02:27:42,590 --> 02:27:42,600
way of distinguishing between them then
 

8483
02:27:42,600 --> 02:27:44,870
way of distinguishing between them then
uh the toll that chemo takes on the rest

8484
02:27:44,870 --> 02:27:44,880
uh the toll that chemo takes on the rest
 

8485
02:27:44,880 --> 02:27:46,610
uh the toll that chemo takes on the rest
of the body is just unbelievable so an

8486
02:27:46,610 --> 02:27:46,620
of the body is just unbelievable so an
 

8487
02:27:46,620 --> 02:27:48,530
of the body is just unbelievable so an
immunotherapy tries to get the immune

8488
02:27:48,530 --> 02:27:48,540
immunotherapy tries to get the immune
 

8489
02:27:48,540 --> 02:27:49,910
immunotherapy tries to get the immune
system to do some of the work exactly

8490
02:27:49,910 --> 02:27:49,920
system to do some of the work exactly
 

8491
02:27:49,920 --> 02:27:52,250
system to do some of the work exactly
yeah I think that's potentially a very

8492
02:27:52,250 --> 02:27:52,260
yeah I think that's potentially a very
 

8493
02:27:52,260 --> 02:27:54,349
yeah I think that's potentially a very
good uh very good approach

8494
02:27:54,349 --> 02:27:54,359
good uh very good approach
 

8495
02:27:54,359 --> 02:27:55,910
good uh very good approach
um if if the immune system can be taught

8496
02:27:55,910 --> 02:27:55,920
um if if the immune system can be taught
 

8497
02:27:55,920 --> 02:27:58,969
um if if the immune system can be taught
to recognize uh enough of of the cancer

8498
02:27:58,969 --> 02:27:58,979
to recognize uh enough of of the cancer
 

8499
02:27:58,979 --> 02:28:00,469
to recognize uh enough of of the cancer
cells that's a pretty good approach but

8500
02:28:00,469 --> 02:28:00,479
cells that's a pretty good approach but
 

8501
02:28:00,479 --> 02:28:01,969
cells that's a pretty good approach but
I but I think but I think our approach

8502
02:28:01,969 --> 02:28:01,979
I but I think but I think our approach
 

8503
02:28:01,979 --> 02:28:04,610
I but I think but I think our approach
is in a way more fundamental because if

8504
02:28:04,610 --> 02:28:04,620
is in a way more fundamental because if
 

8505
02:28:04,620 --> 02:28:06,590
is in a way more fundamental because if
you can if you can keep the cells

8506
02:28:06,590 --> 02:28:06,600
you can if you can keep the cells
 

8507
02:28:06,600 --> 02:28:09,050
you can if you can keep the cells
harnessed toward words organ level goals

8508
02:28:09,050 --> 02:28:09,060
harnessed toward words organ level goals
 

8509
02:28:09,060 --> 02:28:11,630
harnessed toward words organ level goals
as opposed to individual cell goals then

8510
02:28:11,630 --> 02:28:11,640
as opposed to individual cell goals then
 

8511
02:28:11,640 --> 02:28:13,309
as opposed to individual cell goals then
nobody will be making a tumor or

8512
02:28:13,309 --> 02:28:13,319
nobody will be making a tumor or
 

8513
02:28:13,319 --> 02:28:15,290
nobody will be making a tumor or
metastasizing and so on

8514
02:28:15,290 --> 02:28:15,300
metastasizing and so on
 

8515
02:28:15,300 --> 02:28:18,349
metastasizing and so on
so we've been living through a pandemic

8516
02:28:18,349 --> 02:28:18,359
so we've been living through a pandemic
 

8517
02:28:18,359 --> 02:28:21,110
so we've been living through a pandemic
what do you think about viruses in this

8518
02:28:21,110 --> 02:28:21,120
what do you think about viruses in this
 

8519
02:28:21,120 --> 02:28:23,630
what do you think about viruses in this
full beautiful biological context we've

8520
02:28:23,630 --> 02:28:23,640
full beautiful biological context we've
 

8521
02:28:23,640 --> 02:28:25,910
full beautiful biological context we've
been talking about are they beautiful to

8522
02:28:25,910 --> 02:28:25,920
been talking about are they beautiful to
 

8523
02:28:25,920 --> 02:28:29,410
been talking about are they beautiful to
you are they terrifying

8524
02:28:29,410 --> 02:28:29,420
you are they terrifying
 

8525
02:28:29,420 --> 02:28:33,590
you are they terrifying
also maybe let's say are they

8526
02:28:33,590 --> 02:28:33,600
also maybe let's say are they
 

8527
02:28:33,600 --> 02:28:36,050
also maybe let's say are they
since we've been discriminating this

as far as I know and I haven't been able

8536
02:28:45,530 --> 02:28:45,540
as far as I know and I haven't been able
 

8537
02:28:45,540 --> 02:28:46,790
as far as I know and I haven't been able
to find this paper again but but

8538
02:28:46,790 --> 02:28:46,800
to find this paper again but but
 

8539
02:28:46,800 --> 02:28:49,670
to find this paper again but but
somewhere I saw in the last couple of

8540
02:28:49,670 --> 02:28:49,680
somewhere I saw in the last couple of
 

8541
02:28:49,680 --> 02:28:51,110
somewhere I saw in the last couple of
months there was some there was some

8542
02:28:51,110 --> 02:28:51,120
months there was some there was some
 

8543
02:28:51,120 --> 02:28:52,670
months there was some there was some
papers showing an example of a virus

8544
02:28:52,670 --> 02:28:52,680
papers showing an example of a virus
 

8545
02:28:52,680 --> 02:28:54,230
papers showing an example of a virus
that actually had physiology so there

8546
02:28:54,230 --> 02:28:54,240
that actually had physiology so there
 

8547
02:28:54,240 --> 02:28:55,670
that actually had physiology so there
was some something was going on I think

8548
02:28:55,670 --> 02:28:55,680
was some something was going on I think
 

8549
02:28:55,680 --> 02:28:57,410
was some something was going on I think
proton flux or something on the virus

8550
02:28:57,410 --> 02:28:57,420
proton flux or something on the virus
 

8551
02:28:57,420 --> 02:29:00,590
proton flux or something on the virus
itself but but barring that uh generally

8552
02:29:00,590 --> 02:29:00,600
itself but but barring that uh generally
 

8553
02:29:00,600 --> 02:29:02,510
itself but but barring that uh generally
speaking viruses are very passive they

8554
02:29:02,510 --> 02:29:02,520
speaking viruses are very passive they
 

8555
02:29:02,520 --> 02:29:05,270
speaking viruses are very passive they
don't do anything by themselves and so I

8556
02:29:05,270 --> 02:29:05,280
don't do anything by themselves and so I
 

8557
02:29:05,280 --> 02:29:07,429
don't do anything by themselves and so I
don't see any particular reason to

8558
02:29:07,429 --> 02:29:07,439
don't see any particular reason to
 

8559
02:29:07,439 --> 02:29:10,309
don't see any particular reason to
attribute much of a mind to them I think

8560
02:29:10,309 --> 02:29:10,319
attribute much of a mind to them I think
 

8561
02:29:10,319 --> 02:29:14,450
attribute much of a mind to them I think
um you know uh they represent a way to

8562
02:29:14,450 --> 02:29:14,460
um you know uh they represent a way to
 

8563
02:29:14,460 --> 02:29:17,210
um you know uh they represent a way to
hijack other Minds for sure like like

8564
02:29:17,210 --> 02:29:17,220
hijack other Minds for sure like like
 

8565
02:29:17,220 --> 02:29:19,429
hijack other Minds for sure like like
cells and and other things but that's an

8566
02:29:19,429 --> 02:29:19,439
cells and and other things but that's an
 

8567
02:29:19,439 --> 02:29:21,230
cells and and other things but that's an
interesting interplay though if they're

8568
02:29:21,230 --> 02:29:21,240
interesting interplay though if they're
 

8569
02:29:21,240 --> 02:29:23,450
interesting interplay though if they're
hijacking other Minds

8570
02:29:23,450 --> 02:29:23,460
hijacking other Minds
 

8571
02:29:23,460 --> 02:29:25,790
hijacking other Minds
you know the way we're we were talking

8572
02:29:25,790 --> 02:29:25,800
you know the way we're we were talking
 

8573
02:29:25,800 --> 02:29:27,950
you know the way we're we were talking
about living organisms that they can

8574
02:29:27,950 --> 02:29:27,960
about living organisms that they can
 

8575
02:29:27,960 --> 02:29:30,230
about living organisms that they can
interact with each other and have it uh

8576
02:29:30,230 --> 02:29:30,240
interact with each other and have it uh
 

8577
02:29:30,240 --> 02:29:33,530
interact with each other and have it uh
alter each other's trajectory

8578
02:29:33,530 --> 02:29:33,540
alter each other's trajectory
 

8579
02:29:33,540 --> 02:29:36,050
alter each other's trajectory
by having interacted I mean there that's

8580
02:29:36,050 --> 02:29:36,060
by having interacted I mean there that's
 

8581
02:29:36,060 --> 02:29:39,770
by having interacted I mean there that's
that's a deep

8582
02:29:39,770 --> 02:29:39,780

 

8583
02:29:39,780 --> 02:29:41,929

meaningful connection between a virus

8584
02:29:41,929 --> 02:29:41,939
meaningful connection between a virus
 

8585
02:29:41,939 --> 02:29:42,950
meaningful connection between a virus
and a cell

8586
02:29:42,950 --> 02:29:42,960
and a cell
 

8587
02:29:42,960 --> 02:29:46,190
and a cell
and I think both are transformed by the

8588
02:29:46,190 --> 02:29:46,200
and I think both are transformed by the
 

8589
02:29:46,200 --> 02:29:48,290
and I think both are transformed by the
experience and so in that sense both are

8590
02:29:48,290 --> 02:29:48,300
experience and so in that sense both are
 

8591
02:29:48,300 --> 02:29:49,550
experience and so in that sense both are
living

8592
02:29:49,550 --> 02:29:49,560
living
 

8593
02:29:49,560 --> 02:29:51,889
living
yeah yeah you know the whole category

8594
02:29:51,889 --> 02:29:51,899
yeah yeah you know the whole category
 

8595
02:29:51,899 --> 02:29:53,270
yeah yeah you know the whole category
that I um

8596
02:29:53,270 --> 02:29:53,280
that I um
 

8597
02:29:53,280 --> 02:29:56,090
that I um
I don't this question of what's living

8598
02:29:56,090 --> 02:29:56,100
I don't this question of what's living
 

8599
02:29:56,100 --> 02:29:58,250
I don't this question of what's living
and what's not living I I really am I'm

8600
02:29:58,250 --> 02:29:58,260
and what's not living I I really am I'm
 

8601
02:29:58,260 --> 02:29:59,450
and what's not living I I really am I'm
not sure I and I know there's people

8602
02:29:59,450 --> 02:29:59,460
not sure I and I know there's people
 

8603
02:29:59,460 --> 02:30:00,889
not sure I and I know there's people
that work on this and I want to I don't

8604
02:30:00,889 --> 02:30:00,899
that work on this and I want to I don't
 

8605
02:30:00,899 --> 02:30:02,809
that work on this and I want to I don't
want to piss anybody off but but

8606
02:30:02,809 --> 02:30:02,819
want to piss anybody off but but
 

8607
02:30:02,819 --> 02:30:05,090
want to piss anybody off but but
um I have not found that particularly

8608
02:30:05,090 --> 02:30:05,100
um I have not found that particularly
 

8609
02:30:05,100 --> 02:30:07,250
um I have not found that particularly
useful as as to try and make that a

8610
02:30:07,250 --> 02:30:07,260
useful as as to try and make that a
 

8611
02:30:07,260 --> 02:30:10,370
useful as as to try and make that a
binary um kind of uh distinction I think

8612
02:30:10,370 --> 02:30:10,380
binary um kind of uh distinction I think
 

8613
02:30:10,380 --> 02:30:12,790
binary um kind of uh distinction I think
level of cognition is very interesting

8614
02:30:12,790 --> 02:30:12,800
level of cognition is very interesting
 

8615
02:30:12,800 --> 02:30:15,590
level of cognition is very interesting
but as a Continuum but but living a

8616
02:30:15,590 --> 02:30:15,600
but as a Continuum but but living a
 

8617
02:30:15,600 --> 02:30:17,630
but as a Continuum but but living a
non-living at you know I don't I really

8618
02:30:17,630 --> 02:30:17,640
non-living at you know I don't I really
 

8619
02:30:17,640 --> 02:30:18,950
non-living at you know I don't I really
know what to do with that I don't I

8620
02:30:18,950 --> 02:30:18,960
know what to do with that I don't I
 

8621
02:30:18,960 --> 02:30:20,690
know what to do with that I don't I
don't know what you do next after after

8622
02:30:20,690 --> 02:30:20,700
don't know what you do next after after
 

8623
02:30:20,700 --> 02:30:22,910
don't know what you do next after after
making that distinction that's why I

8624
02:30:22,910 --> 02:30:22,920
making that distinction that's why I
 

8625
02:30:22,920 --> 02:30:25,370
making that distinction that's why I
make the very binary distinction can I

8626
02:30:25,370 --> 02:30:25,380
make the very binary distinction can I
 

8627
02:30:25,380 --> 02:30:28,070
make the very binary distinction can I
have sex with it or not can I eat it or

8628
02:30:28,070 --> 02:30:28,080
have sex with it or not can I eat it or
 

8629
02:30:28,080 --> 02:30:30,050
have sex with it or not can I eat it or
not those because those are actionable

8630
02:30:30,050 --> 02:30:30,060
not those because those are actionable
 

8631
02:30:30,060 --> 02:30:31,550
not those because those are actionable
right yeah well I think that's a

8632
02:30:31,550 --> 02:30:31,560
right yeah well I think that's a
 

8633
02:30:31,560 --> 02:30:32,870
right yeah well I think that's a
critical point that you brought up

8634
02:30:32,870 --> 02:30:32,880
critical point that you brought up
 

8635
02:30:32,880 --> 02:30:35,630
critical point that you brought up
because how you relate to something is

8636
02:30:35,630 --> 02:30:35,640
because how you relate to something is
 

8637
02:30:35,640 --> 02:30:37,910
because how you relate to something is
really what this is all about right as

8638
02:30:37,910 --> 02:30:37,920
really what this is all about right as
 

8639
02:30:37,920 --> 02:30:40,190
really what this is all about right as
an engineer how do I control it but

8640
02:30:40,190 --> 02:30:40,200
an engineer how do I control it but
 

8641
02:30:40,200 --> 02:30:41,630
an engineer how do I control it but
maybe I shouldn't be controlling it

8642
02:30:41,630 --> 02:30:41,640
maybe I shouldn't be controlling it
 

8643
02:30:41,640 --> 02:30:43,730
maybe I shouldn't be controlling it
maybe I should be you know uh can I have

8644
02:30:43,730 --> 02:30:43,740
maybe I should be you know uh can I have
 

8645
02:30:43,740 --> 02:30:45,230
maybe I should be you know uh can I have
a relationship with it should I be

8646
02:30:45,230 --> 02:30:45,240
a relationship with it should I be
 

8647
02:30:45,240 --> 02:30:47,150
a relationship with it should I be
listening to its advice like like all

8648
02:30:47,150 --> 02:30:47,160
listening to its advice like like all
 

8649
02:30:47,160 --> 02:30:48,950
listening to its advice like like all
the way from you know I need to take it

8650
02:30:48,950 --> 02:30:48,960
the way from you know I need to take it
 

8651
02:30:48,960 --> 02:30:51,830
the way from you know I need to take it
apart all the way to uh I better do what

8652
02:30:51,830 --> 02:30:51,840
apart all the way to uh I better do what
 

8653
02:30:51,840 --> 02:30:52,849
apart all the way to uh I better do what
it says because it seems to be pretty

8654
02:30:52,849 --> 02:30:52,859
it says because it seems to be pretty
 

8655
02:30:52,859 --> 02:30:54,530
it says because it seems to be pretty
smart and everything in between right

8656
02:30:54,530 --> 02:30:54,540
smart and everything in between right
 

8657
02:30:54,540 --> 02:30:56,690
smart and everything in between right
that's really what we're asking about

8658
02:30:56,690 --> 02:30:56,700
that's really what we're asking about
 

8659
02:30:56,700 --> 02:30:58,670
that's really what we're asking about
yeah we need to understand our

02:30:58,670 --> 02:30:58,680
yeah we need to understand our
 

8661
02:30:58,680 --> 02:31:00,590
yeah we need to understand our
relationship to it we're searching for

8662
02:31:00,590 --> 02:31:00,600
relationship to it we're searching for
 

8663
02:31:00,600 --> 02:31:01,969
relationship to it we're searching for
that relationship even in the most

8664
02:31:01,969 --> 02:31:01,979
that relationship even in the most
 

8665
02:31:01,979 --> 02:31:03,650
that relationship even in the most
trivial senses

8666
02:31:03,650 --> 02:31:03,660
trivial senses
 

8667
02:31:03,660 --> 02:31:05,570
trivial senses
you came up with a lot of interesting

8668
02:31:05,570 --> 02:31:05,580
you came up with a lot of interesting
 

8669
02:31:05,580 --> 02:31:07,309
you came up with a lot of interesting
terms

8670
02:31:07,309 --> 02:31:07,319
terms
 

8671
02:31:07,319 --> 02:31:10,190
terms
we've mentioned some of them uh agential

8672
02:31:10,190 --> 02:31:10,200
we've mentioned some of them uh agential
 

8673
02:31:10,200 --> 02:31:13,010
we've mentioned some of them uh agential
material that's a really interesting one

8674
02:31:13,010 --> 02:31:13,020
material that's a really interesting one
 

8675
02:31:13,020 --> 02:31:16,130
material that's a really interesting one
that's a really interesting one for the

02:31:16,130 --> 02:31:16,140
that's a really interesting one for the
 

8677
02:31:16,140 --> 02:31:17,990
that's a really interesting one for the
future of computation and artificial

02:31:17,990 --> 02:31:18,000
future of computation and artificial
 

8679
02:31:18,000 --> 02:31:19,610

all that

8682
02:31:20,809 --> 02:31:20,819
all that
 

8683
02:31:20,819 --> 02:31:23,570
all that
there's also let me go through some of

8684
02:31:23,570 --> 02:31:23,580
there's also let me go through some of
 

8685
02:31:23,580 --> 02:31:25,790
there's also let me go through some of
them if they spark some interesting

8686
02:31:25,790 --> 02:31:25,800
them if they spark some interesting
 

8687
02:31:25,800 --> 02:31:29,330
them if they spark some interesting
thought for you there's teleophobia the

8688
02:31:29,330 --> 02:31:29,340
thought for you there's teleophobia the
 

8689
02:31:29,340 --> 02:31:31,010
thought for you there's teleophobia the
unwarranted fear of airing on the side

8690
02:31:31,010 --> 02:31:31,020
unwarranted fear of airing on the side
 

8691
02:31:31,020 --> 02:31:33,650
unwarranted fear of airing on the side
of too much agency when considering a

8692
02:31:33,650 --> 02:31:33,660
of too much agency when considering a
 

8693
02:31:33,660 --> 02:31:34,790
of too much agency when considering a
new system

8694
02:31:34,790 --> 02:31:34,800
new system
 

8695
02:31:34,800 --> 02:31:37,190
new system
yeah I mean that's the opposite I mean

8696
02:31:37,190 --> 02:31:37,200
yeah I mean that's the opposite I mean
 

8697
02:31:37,200 --> 02:31:38,870
yeah I mean that's the opposite I mean
being afraid of

8698
02:31:38,870 --> 02:31:38,880
being afraid of
 

8699
02:31:38,880 --> 02:31:41,210
being afraid of
maybe anthropomorphizing the thing this

8700
02:31:41,210 --> 02:31:41,220
maybe anthropomorphizing the thing this
 

8701
02:31:41,220 --> 02:31:43,070
maybe anthropomorphizing the thing this
will get some people um ticked off I

8702
02:31:43,070 --> 02:31:43,080
will get some people um ticked off I
 

8703
02:31:43,080 --> 02:31:45,590
will get some people um ticked off I
think but but I I don't think I I think

8704
02:31:45,590 --> 02:31:45,600
think but but I I don't think I I think
 

8705
02:31:45,600 --> 02:31:47,469
think but but I I don't think I I think
I think the whole notion of

8706
02:31:47,469 --> 02:31:47,479
I think the whole notion of
 

8707
02:31:47,479 --> 02:31:50,330
I think the whole notion of
anthropomorphizing is a holdover from an

8708
02:31:50,330 --> 02:31:50,340
anthropomorphizing is a holdover from an
 

8709
02:31:50,340 --> 02:31:53,510
anthropomorphizing is a holdover from an
A from a pre-scientific uh age where

8710
02:31:53,510 --> 02:31:53,520
A from a pre-scientific uh age where
 

8711
02:31:53,520 --> 02:31:55,309
A from a pre-scientific uh age where
humans were magic and everything else

8712
02:31:55,309 --> 02:31:55,319
humans were magic and everything else
 

8713
02:31:55,319 --> 02:31:57,190
humans were magic and everything else
wasn't magic and you were

8714
02:31:57,190 --> 02:31:57,200
wasn't magic and you were
 

8715
02:31:57,200 --> 02:31:59,690
wasn't magic and you were
anthropomorphizing when you dared

8716
02:31:59,690 --> 02:31:59,700
anthropomorphizing when you dared
 

8717
02:31:59,700 --> 02:32:01,969
anthropomorphizing when you dared
suggest that uh something else has some

8718
02:32:01,969 --> 02:32:01,979
suggest that uh something else has some
 

8719
02:32:01,979 --> 02:32:03,710
suggest that uh something else has some
features of humans and I think we need

8720
02:32:03,710 --> 02:32:03,720
features of humans and I think we need
 

8721
02:32:03,720 --> 02:32:07,250
features of humans and I think we need
to be Way Beyond that and this this

8722
02:32:07,250 --> 02:32:07,260
to be Way Beyond that and this this
 

8723
02:32:07,260 --> 02:32:09,710
to be Way Beyond that and this this
issue of anthropomorphizing I think is

8724
02:32:09,710 --> 02:32:09,720
issue of anthropomorphizing I think is
 

8725
02:32:09,720 --> 02:32:11,690
issue of anthropomorphizing I think is
um it's a cheap it's a cheap charge I

8726
02:32:11,690 --> 02:32:11,700
um it's a cheap it's a cheap charge I
 

8727
02:32:11,700 --> 02:32:13,670
um it's a cheap it's a cheap charge I
don't think it it holds any water at all

8728
02:32:13,670 --> 02:32:13,680
don't think it it holds any water at all
 

8729
02:32:13,680 --> 02:32:16,309
don't think it it holds any water at all
other than when somebody makes a

02:32:16,309 --> 02:32:16,319
other than when somebody makes a
 

8731
02:32:16,319 --> 02:32:18,410
other than when somebody makes a
cognitive claim I I think all cognitive

8732
02:32:18,410 --> 02:32:18,420
cognitive claim I I think all cognitive
 

8733
02:32:18,420 --> 02:32:20,389
cognitive claim I I think all cognitive
claims are engineering claims really so

8734
02:32:20,389 --> 02:32:20,399
claims are engineering claims really so
 

8735
02:32:20,399 --> 02:32:22,610
claims are engineering claims really so
when somebody says this thing knows or

8736
02:32:22,610 --> 02:32:22,620
when somebody says this thing knows or
 

8737
02:32:22,620 --> 02:32:24,349
when somebody says this thing knows or
this thing hopes or this thing wants or

8738
02:32:24,349 --> 02:32:24,359
this thing hopes or this thing wants or
 

8739
02:32:24,359 --> 02:32:26,630
this thing hopes or this thing wants or
this thing predicts all you can say is

8740
02:32:26,630 --> 02:32:26,640
this thing predicts all you can say is

8745
02:32:31,500 --> 02:32:33,710

hypothesis and we will see if this thing

8746
02:32:33,710 --> 02:32:33,720
hypothesis and we will see if this thing
 

8747
02:32:33,720 --> 02:32:35,389

helps us or not and then and then we can

so so back in uh this this I I first
 

8807
02:33:49,380 --> 02:33:51,889
so so back in uh this this I I first
came up with this back in 2018 I want to

8808
02:33:51,889 --> 02:33:51,899
came up with this back in 2018 I want to
 

8809
02:33:51,899 --> 02:33:54,230
came up with this back in 2018 I want to
say we had a there was a conference um a

8810
02:33:54,230 --> 02:33:54,240
say we had a there was a conference um a
 

8811
02:33:54,240 --> 02:33:55,670
say we had a there was a conference um a
Templeton a conference where they

8812
02:33:55,670 --> 02:33:55,680
Templeton a conference where they
 

8813
02:33:55,680 --> 02:33:58,610
Templeton a conference where they
challenged us to come up with Frameworks

8814
02:33:58,610 --> 02:33:58,620
challenged us to come up with Frameworks
 

8815
02:33:58,620 --> 02:34:00,170
challenged us to come up with Frameworks
I think actually it's the here it's the

8816
02:34:00,170 --> 02:34:00,180
I think actually it's the here it's the
 

8817
02:34:00,180 --> 02:34:02,210
I think actually it's the here it's the
diverse intelligence uh community that

8818
02:34:02,210 --> 02:34:02,220
diverse intelligence uh community that
 

8819
02:34:02,220 --> 02:34:03,830
diverse intelligence uh community that
summer Institute yeah they had a summer

8820
02:34:03,830 --> 02:34:03,840
summer Institute yeah they had a summer
 

8821
02:34:03,840 --> 02:34:05,990
summer Institute yeah they had a summer
Institute but um the logos the B with

8822
02:34:05,990 --> 02:34:06,000
Institute but um the logos the B with
 

8823
02:34:06,000 --> 02:34:07,610
Institute but um the logos the B with
some circuits yeah it's got different

8824
02:34:07,610 --> 02:34:07,620
some circuits yeah it's got different
 

8825
02:34:07,620 --> 02:34:09,710
some circuits yeah it's got different
different life forms and you know so so

8826
02:34:09,710 --> 02:34:09,720
different life forms and you know so so
 

8827
02:34:09,720 --> 02:34:11,870
different life forms and you know so so
so the whole the whole uh program is

8828
02:34:11,870 --> 02:34:11,880
so the whole the whole uh program is
 

8829
02:34:11,880 --> 02:34:13,250
so the whole the whole uh program is
called diverse intelligence and they

8830
02:34:13,250 --> 02:34:13,260
called diverse intelligence and they
 

8831
02:34:13,260 --> 02:34:14,510
called diverse intelligence and they
sort they challenge you to stick them up

8832
02:34:14,510 --> 02:34:14,520
sort they challenge you to stick them up
 

8833
02:34:14,520 --> 02:34:16,849
sort they challenge you to stick them up
with a framework that was suitable for

8843
02:34:24,180 --> 02:34:27,110
human who are not good with an octopus
not good with a plant and so on so so I

8844
02:34:27,110 --> 02:34:27,120
not good with a plant and so on so so I
 

8845
02:34:27,120 --> 02:34:29,090
not good with a plant and so on so so I
started thinking about this and

8846
02:34:29,090 --> 02:34:29,100
started thinking about this and
 

8847
02:34:29,100 --> 02:34:32,990
started thinking about this and
um I I asked myself what uh what do all

8848
02:34:32,990 --> 02:34:33,000
um I I asked myself what uh what do all
 

8849
02:34:33,000 --> 02:34:34,730
um I I asked myself what uh what do all
cognitive agents no matter what their

architecture is what what what do

8854
02:34:39,889 --> 02:34:39,899
architecture is what what what do
 

8855
02:34:39,899 --> 02:34:41,330
architecture is what what what do
cognitive agents have in common and it

8856
02:34:41,330 --> 02:34:41,340
cognitive agents have in common and it
 

8857
02:34:41,340 --> 02:34:42,230
cognitive agents have in common and it
seems to me that what they have in

seems to me that what they have in
common is some degree of Competency to

8860
02:34:44,870 --> 02:34:44,880
common is some degree of Competency to
 

8861
02:34:44,880 --> 02:34:46,790
common is some degree of Competency to
pursue a goal and so what you can do

8862
02:34:46,790 --> 02:34:46,800
pursue a goal and so what you can do
 

8863
02:34:46,800 --> 02:34:48,530
pursue a goal and so what you can do
then is you can draw and so what I what

8864
02:34:48,530 --> 02:34:48,540
then is you can draw and so what I what
 

8865
02:34:48,540 --> 02:34:49,910
then is you can draw and so what I what
I what I ended up drawing was this thing

8866
02:34:49,910 --> 02:34:49,920
I what I ended up drawing was this thing
 

8867
02:34:49,920 --> 02:34:51,230
I what I ended up drawing was this thing
that it's kind of like a like a

02:34:51,230 --> 02:34:51,240
that it's kind of like a like a

where all of space is could collapsed

8872
02:34:56,750 --> 02:34:56,760
where all of space is could collapsed
 

8873
02:34:56,760 --> 02:34:58,670
where all of space is could collapsed
into one axis and then and then here and

02:34:58,670 --> 02:34:58,680
into one axis and then and then here and
 

8875
02:34:58,680 --> 02:35:00,710
into one axis and then and then here and
then time is is this axis and then what

8876
02:35:00,710 --> 02:35:00,720
then time is is this axis and then what
 

8877
02:35:00,720 --> 02:35:02,090
then time is is this axis and then what
you can do is you can draw for any

8878
02:35:02,090 --> 02:35:02,100
you can do is you can draw for any
 

8879
02:35:02,100 --> 02:35:04,570
you can do is you can draw for any
creature you can you can

8880
02:35:04,570 --> 02:35:04,580
creature you can you can

semi-quantitatively estimate what are
 

8883
02:35:06,960 --> 02:35:10,030
semi-quantitatively estimate what are
the what are the spatial and temporal

8884
02:35:10,030 --> 02:35:10,040
the what are the spatial and temporal
 

8885
02:35:10,040 --> 02:35:12,590
the what are the spatial and temporal
goals that it can that it's capable of

02:35:12,590 --> 02:35:12,600
goals that it can that it's capable of
 

8887
02:35:12,600 --> 02:35:14,750
goals that it can that it's capable of
pursuing so for example if you are a

8888
02:35:14,750 --> 02:35:14,760
pursuing so for example if you are a
 

8889
02:35:14,760 --> 02:35:17,990
pursuing so for example if you are a
tick and all you can uh all you really

8890
02:35:17,990 --> 02:35:18,000
tick and all you can uh all you really
 

8891
02:35:18,000 --> 02:35:20,210
tick and all you can uh all you really
are able to pursue is Maxima or

8892
02:35:20,210 --> 02:35:20,220
are able to pursue is Maxima or
 

8893
02:35:20,220 --> 02:35:22,550
are able to pursue is Maxima or
bacterium in the maximizing the level of

8894
02:35:22,550 --> 02:35:22,560
bacterium in the maximizing the level of
 

8895
02:35:22,560 --> 02:35:24,110
bacterium in the maximizing the level of
some some chemical in your vicinity

8896
02:35:24,110 --> 02:35:24,120
some some chemical in your vicinity
 

8897
02:35:24,120 --> 02:35:25,730
some some chemical in your vicinity
right that's all you've got it's a tiny

8898
02:35:25,730 --> 02:35:25,740
right that's all you've got it's a tiny
 

8899
02:35:25,740 --> 02:35:27,469
right that's all you've got it's a tiny
little icon then then you're a simple

8900
02:35:27,469 --> 02:35:27,479
little icon then then you're a simple
 

8901
02:35:27,479 --> 02:35:30,110
little icon then then you're a simple
system like a tick or a bacterium if you

8902
02:35:30,110 --> 02:35:30,120
system like a tick or a bacterium if you
 

8903
02:35:30,120 --> 02:35:32,809
system like a tick or a bacterium if you
are something like a dog well you've got

8904
02:35:32,809 --> 02:35:32,819
are something like a dog well you've got
 

8905
02:35:32,819 --> 02:35:36,889
are something like a dog well you've got
some ability to um uh to care about some

8906
02:35:36,889 --> 02:35:36,899
some ability to um uh to care about some
 

8907
02:35:36,899 --> 02:35:38,870
some ability to um uh to care about some
some spatial region some temporal you

8908
02:35:38,870 --> 02:35:38,880
some spatial region some temporal you
 

8909
02:35:38,880 --> 02:35:40,070
some spatial region some temporal you
know you can you can remember a little

8910
02:35:40,070 --> 02:35:40,080
know you can you can remember a little
 

8911
02:35:40,080 --> 02:35:41,750
know you can you can remember a little
bit backwards you can you can predict a

02:35:41,750 --> 02:35:41,760
bit backwards you can you can predict a
 

8913
02:35:41,760 --> 02:35:43,790
bit backwards you can you can predict a
little bit forwards but you're never

8914
02:35:43,790 --> 02:35:43,800
little bit forwards but you're never
 

8915
02:35:43,800 --> 02:35:45,889
little bit forwards but you're never
ever going to care about what happens in

8916
02:35:45,889 --> 02:35:45,899
ever going to care about what happens in

8921
02:35:49,500 --> 02:35:50,870
it just it's just as far as We Know It's
Just impossible for that kind of

02:35:56,760 --> 02:35:59,330
after you're dead right so you might

02:37:22,190 --> 02:37:22,200
specifically on the bioelectrics I mean
 

9013
02:37:22,200 --> 02:37:23,510
specifically on the bioelectrics I mean
there's also of course biochemical

9014
02:37:23,510 --> 02:37:23,520
there's also of course biochemical
 

9015
02:37:23,520 --> 02:37:25,250
there's also of course biochemical
biomechanical who knows what else you

9016
02:37:25,250 --> 02:37:25,260
biomechanical who knows what else you
 

9017
02:37:25,260 --> 02:37:27,770
biomechanical who knows what else you
know maybe Optical um kinds of signaling

9018
02:37:27,770 --> 02:37:27,780
know maybe Optical um kinds of signaling
 

9019
02:37:27,780 --> 02:37:29,690
know maybe Optical um kinds of signaling
systems there as well Target morphology

9020
02:37:29,690 --> 02:37:29,700
systems there as well Target morphology
 

9021
02:37:29,700 --> 02:37:32,990
systems there as well Target morphology
is is interesting it really uh it's

9022
02:37:32,990 --> 02:37:33,000
is is interesting it really uh it's
 

9023
02:37:33,000 --> 02:37:36,770
is is interesting it really uh it's
designed to capture this idea that it's

9024
02:37:36,770 --> 02:37:36,780
designed to capture this idea that it's
 

9025
02:37:36,780 --> 02:37:38,870
designed to capture this idea that it's
not just feed forward emergence and

9026
02:37:38,870 --> 02:37:38,880
not just feed forward emergence and
 

9027
02:37:38,880 --> 02:37:40,429
not just feed forward emergence and
oftentimes in biology I mean of course

9028
02:37:40,429 --> 02:37:40,439
oftentimes in biology I mean of course
 

9029
02:37:40,439 --> 02:37:42,050
oftentimes in biology I mean of course
that happens too but but in many cases

9030
02:37:42,050 --> 02:37:42,060
that happens too but but in many cases
 

9031
02:37:42,060 --> 02:37:44,389
that happens too but but in many cases
in biology the system is specifically

9032
02:37:44,389 --> 02:37:44,399
in biology the system is specifically
 

9033
02:37:44,399 --> 02:37:47,330
in biology the system is specifically
working towards a Target in anatomical

9034
02:37:47,330 --> 02:37:47,340
working towards a Target in anatomical
 

9035
02:37:47,340 --> 02:37:48,770
working towards a Target in anatomical
amorphous space right it's a it's a

9036
02:37:48,770 --> 02:37:48,780
amorphous space right it's a it's a
 

9037
02:37:48,780 --> 02:37:50,750
amorphous space right it's a it's a
navigation task really these kind of

9038
02:37:50,750 --> 02:37:50,760
navigation task really these kind of
 

9039
02:37:50,760 --> 02:37:54,950
navigation task really these kind of
problem solving can be um uh uh ski you

9040
02:37:54,950 --> 02:37:54,960
problem solving can be um uh uh ski you
 

9041
02:37:54,960 --> 02:37:57,710
problem solving can be um uh uh ski you
know uh formalized as navigation tasks

9042
02:37:57,710 --> 02:37:57,720
know uh formalized as navigation tasks
 

9043
02:37:57,720 --> 02:37:59,389
know uh formalized as navigation tasks
and that they're really going towards a

9044
02:37:59,389 --> 02:37:59,399
and that they're really going towards a
 

9045
02:37:59,399 --> 02:38:00,830
and that they're really going towards a
particular region how do you know

9046
02:38:00,830 --> 02:38:00,840
particular region how do you know
 

9047
02:38:00,840 --> 02:38:02,150
particular region how do you know
because you deviate them and then they

9048
02:38:02,150 --> 02:38:02,160
because you deviate them and then they
 

9049
02:38:02,160 --> 02:38:03,410
because you deviate them and then they
go back

9050
02:38:03,410 --> 02:38:03,420
go back
 

9051
02:38:03,420 --> 02:38:07,790
go back
let me ask you because you've

9052
02:38:07,790 --> 02:38:07,800

 

9053
02:38:07,800 --> 02:38:10,490

really challenged a lot of ideas in

9054
02:38:10,490 --> 02:38:10,500
really challenged a lot of ideas in
 

9055
02:38:10,500 --> 02:38:13,730
really challenged a lot of ideas in
biology in in the work you do probably

9056
02:38:13,730 --> 02:38:13,740
biology in in the work you do probably
 

9057
02:38:13,740 --> 02:38:16,370
biology in in the work you do probably
because uh some of your rebelliousness

9058
02:38:16,370 --> 02:38:16,380
because uh some of your rebelliousness
 

9059
02:38:16,380 --> 02:38:17,990
because uh some of your rebelliousness
comes from the fact that you came from a

9060
02:38:17,990 --> 02:38:18,000
comes from the fact that you came from a
 

9061
02:38:18,000 --> 02:38:20,410
comes from the fact that you came from a
different field of Computer Engineering

9062
02:38:20,410 --> 02:38:20,420
different field of Computer Engineering
 

9063
02:38:20,420 --> 02:38:22,910
different field of Computer Engineering
but could you give advice to young

9064
02:38:22,910 --> 02:38:22,920
but could you give advice to young
 

9065
02:38:22,920 --> 02:38:25,190
but could you give advice to young
people today in high school or college

9066
02:38:25,190 --> 02:38:25,200
people today in high school or college
 

9067
02:38:25,200 --> 02:38:27,469
people today in high school or college
they're trying to pave

9068
02:38:27,469 --> 02:38:27,479
they're trying to pave
 

9069
02:38:27,479 --> 02:38:31,610
they're trying to pave
their life story whether it's in science

9070
02:38:31,610 --> 02:38:31,620
their life story whether it's in science
 

9071
02:38:31,620 --> 02:38:33,830
their life story whether it's in science
or elsewhere how they can have a career

9072
02:38:33,830 --> 02:38:33,840
or elsewhere how they can have a career
 

9073
02:38:33,840 --> 02:38:36,230
or elsewhere how they can have a career
they can be proud of or a life they can

9074
02:38:36,230 --> 02:38:36,240
they can be proud of or a life they can
 

9075
02:38:36,240 --> 02:38:39,410
they can be proud of or a life they can
be proud of advice boy it's dangerous to

9076
02:38:39,410 --> 02:38:39,420
be proud of advice boy it's dangerous to
 

9077
02:38:39,420 --> 02:38:40,670
be proud of advice boy it's dangerous to
give advice because things change so

9078
02:38:40,670 --> 02:38:40,680
give advice because things change so
 

9079
02:38:40,680 --> 02:38:42,889
give advice because things change so
fast but uh one Central thing I can say

9080
02:38:42,889 --> 02:38:42,899
fast but uh one Central thing I can say
 

9081
02:38:42,899 --> 02:38:45,710
fast but uh one Central thing I can say
moving up and and through Academia and

9082
02:38:45,710 --> 02:38:45,720
moving up and and through Academia and
 

9083
02:38:45,720 --> 02:38:48,050
moving up and and through Academia and
whatnot you will be surrounded by really

9084
02:38:48,050 --> 02:38:48,060
whatnot you will be surrounded by really
 

9085
02:38:48,060 --> 02:38:50,690
whatnot you will be surrounded by really
smart people and what you need to do is

9086
02:38:50,690 --> 02:38:50,700
smart people and what you need to do is
 

9087
02:38:50,700 --> 02:38:53,690
smart people and what you need to do is
be very careful at distinguishing

9088
02:38:53,690 --> 02:38:53,700
be very careful at distinguishing
 

9089
02:38:53,700 --> 02:38:55,490
be very careful at distinguishing

02:38:59,270 --> 02:38:59,280
critique versus kind of Meta Meta advice
 

9093
02:38:59,280 --> 02:39:00,950
critique versus kind of Meta Meta advice
and what I mean by that is

9094
02:39:00,950 --> 02:39:00,960
and what I mean by that is
 

9095
02:39:00,960 --> 02:39:02,990
and what I mean by that is
if if somebody really smart and

giving you specific

9100
02:39:08,690 --> 02:39:08,700
giving you specific
 

9101
02:39:08,700 --> 02:39:10,550
giving you specific
um critiques on what you've done it

9102
02:39:10,550 --> 02:39:10,560
um critiques on what you've done it
 

9103
02:39:10,560 --> 02:39:12,469
um critiques on what you've done it
that's gold that's an opportunity to

9104
02:39:12,469 --> 02:39:12,479
that's gold that's an opportunity to
 

9105
02:39:12,479 --> 02:39:14,090
that's gold that's an opportunity to
hone your craft to get better at what

9106
02:39:14,090 --> 02:39:14,100
hone your craft to get better at what
 

9107
02:39:14,100 --> 02:39:15,710
hone your craft to get better at what
you're doing to learn to find your

9108
02:39:15,710 --> 02:39:15,720
you're doing to learn to find your
 

9109
02:39:15,720 --> 02:39:17,210
you're doing to learn to find your
mistakes like that's great

9110
02:39:17,210 --> 02:39:17,220
mistakes like that's great
 

9111
02:39:17,220 --> 02:39:20,030
mistakes like that's great
if they are telling you what you ought

9112
02:39:20,030 --> 02:39:20,040
if they are telling you what you ought
 

9113
02:39:20,040 --> 02:39:22,550
if they are telling you what you ought
to be studying how you ought to approach

9114
02:39:22,550 --> 02:39:22,560
to be studying how you ought to approach
 

9115
02:39:22,560 --> 02:39:24,050
to be studying how you ought to approach
things what is the right way to think

9116
02:39:24,050 --> 02:39:24,060
things what is the right way to think
 

9117
02:39:24,060 --> 02:39:25,550
things what is the right way to think
about things

9118
02:39:25,550 --> 02:39:25,560
about things
 

9119
02:39:25,560 --> 02:39:28,309
about things
you should probably ignore most of that

9120
02:39:28,309 --> 02:39:28,319
you should probably ignore most of that
 

9121
02:39:28,319 --> 02:39:30,110
you should probably ignore most of that
and the reason I make that distinction

9122
02:39:30,110 --> 02:39:30,120
and the reason I make that distinction
 

9123
02:39:30,120 --> 02:39:33,170
and the reason I make that distinction
is that a lot of really

9124
02:39:33,170 --> 02:39:33,180
is that a lot of really
 

9125
02:39:33,180 --> 02:39:36,050
is that a lot of really
um a really successful uh people are

9126
02:39:36,050 --> 02:39:36,060
um a really successful uh people are
 

9127
02:39:36,060 --> 02:39:38,150
um a really successful uh people are
very well calibrated on their own ideas

9128
02:39:38,150 --> 02:39:38,160
very well calibrated on their own ideas
 

9129
02:39:38,160 --> 02:39:40,490
very well calibrated on their own ideas
and they on in their own field and their

9130
02:39:40,490 --> 02:39:40,500
and they on in their own field and their
 

9131
02:39:40,500 --> 02:39:42,590
and they on in their own field and their
own you know sort of uh area and they

9132
02:39:42,590 --> 02:39:42,600
own you know sort of uh area and they
 

9133
02:39:42,600 --> 02:39:44,150
own you know sort of uh area and they
know exactly what works and what doesn't

9134
02:39:44,150 --> 02:39:44,160
know exactly what works and what doesn't
 

9135
02:39:44,160 --> 02:39:45,710
know exactly what works and what doesn't
and what's good and what's bad but

9136
02:39:45,710 --> 02:39:45,720
and what's good and what's bad but
 

9137
02:39:45,720 --> 02:39:47,870
and what's good and what's bad but
they're not calibrated on your ideas and

9138
02:39:47,870 --> 02:39:47,880
they're not calibrated on your ideas and
 

9139
02:39:47,880 --> 02:39:50,870
they're not calibrated on your ideas and
so so uh the things they will they will

9140
02:39:50,870 --> 02:39:50,880
so so uh the things they will they will
 

9141
02:39:50,880 --> 02:39:52,309
so so uh the things they will they will
say oh you know this is a dumb idea

9142
02:39:52,309 --> 02:39:52,319
say oh you know this is a dumb idea
 

9143
02:39:52,319 --> 02:39:53,870
say oh you know this is a dumb idea
don't do this and you shouldn't do that

9144
02:39:53,870 --> 02:39:53,880
don't do this and you shouldn't do that
 

9145
02:39:53,880 --> 02:39:58,130
don't do this and you shouldn't do that
that stuff is generally uh worse than

9146
02:39:58,130 --> 02:39:58,140
that stuff is generally uh worse than
 

9147
02:39:58,140 --> 02:40:00,590
that stuff is generally uh worse than
worse than useless it can be very very

9148
02:40:00,590 --> 02:40:00,600
worse than useless it can be very very
 

9149
02:40:00,600 --> 02:40:02,809
worse than useless it can be very very
um uh demoralizing and and and and

9150
02:40:02,809 --> 02:40:02,819
um uh demoralizing and and and and
 

9151
02:40:02,819 --> 02:40:05,750
um uh demoralizing and and and and
really limiting and so so what I say to

9152
02:40:05,750 --> 02:40:05,760
really limiting and so so what I say to
 

9153
02:40:05,760 --> 02:40:08,690
really limiting and so so what I say to
people is read very broadly work really

9154
02:40:08,690 --> 02:40:08,700
people is read very broadly work really
 

9155
02:40:08,700 --> 02:40:10,130
people is read very broadly work really
hard know what you're talking about take

9156
02:40:10,130 --> 02:40:10,140
hard know what you're talking about take
 

9157
02:40:10,140 --> 02:40:12,530
hard know what you're talking about take
all specific criticism as a

9158
02:40:12,530 --> 02:40:12,540
all specific criticism as a
 

9159
02:40:12,540 --> 02:40:14,389
all specific criticism as a
um as an opportunity to improve what

9160
02:40:14,389 --> 02:40:14,399
um as an opportunity to improve what
 

9161
02:40:14,399 --> 02:40:16,190
um as an opportunity to improve what
you're doing and then completely ignore

9162
02:40:16,190 --> 02:40:16,200
you're doing and then completely ignore
 

9163
02:40:16,200 --> 02:40:18,650
you're doing and then completely ignore
everything else because I I just tell

9164
02:40:18,650 --> 02:40:18,660
everything else because I I just tell
 

9165
02:40:18,660 --> 02:40:20,030
everything else because I I just tell
you from like from from my own

9166
02:40:20,030 --> 02:40:20,040
you from like from from my own
 

9167
02:40:20,040 --> 02:40:23,450
you from like from from my own
experience um most of what I consider to

9168
02:40:23,450 --> 02:40:23,460
experience um most of what I consider to
 

9169
02:40:23,460 --> 02:40:24,770
experience um most of what I consider to
be interesting and useful things that

9170
02:40:24,770 --> 02:40:24,780
be interesting and useful things that
 

9171
02:40:24,780 --> 02:40:27,110
be interesting and useful things that
we've done very smart people have said

9172
02:40:27,110 --> 02:40:27,120
we've done very smart people have said
 

9173
02:40:27,120 --> 02:40:28,670
we've done very smart people have said
this is a terrible idea don't don't

9174
02:40:28,670 --> 02:40:28,680
this is a terrible idea don't don't
 

9175
02:40:28,680 --> 02:40:31,010
this is a terrible idea don't don't
don't do that don't you know just um

9176
02:40:31,010 --> 02:40:31,020
don't do that don't you know just um
 

9177
02:40:31,020 --> 02:40:32,570
don't do that don't you know just um
yeah I think I think we we just don't

9178
02:40:32,570 --> 02:40:32,580
yeah I think I think we we just don't
 

9179
02:40:32,580 --> 02:40:34,490
yeah I think I think we we just don't
know we have no idea beyond beyond our

9180
02:40:34,490 --> 02:40:34,500
know we have no idea beyond beyond our
 

9181
02:40:34,500 --> 02:40:36,590
know we have no idea beyond beyond our
own like at best we know what we ought

9182
02:40:36,590 --> 02:40:36,600
own like at best we know what we ought
 

9183
02:40:36,600 --> 02:40:38,150
own like at best we know what we ought
to be doing we very rarely know what

9184
02:40:38,150 --> 02:40:38,160
to be doing we very rarely know what
 

9185
02:40:38,160 --> 02:40:40,190
to be doing we very rarely know what
anybody else should be doing yeah and

9186
02:40:40,190 --> 02:40:40,200
anybody else should be doing yeah and
 

9187
02:40:40,200 --> 02:40:41,929
anybody else should be doing yeah and
their ideas

9188
02:40:41,929 --> 02:40:41,939
their ideas
 

9189
02:40:41,939 --> 02:40:43,790
their ideas
their perspective has been also

9190
02:40:43,790 --> 02:40:43,800
their perspective has been also
 

9191
02:40:43,800 --> 02:40:45,530
their perspective has been also
calibrated not just on their field and

9192
02:40:45,530 --> 02:40:45,540
calibrated not just on their field and
 

9193
02:40:45,540 --> 02:40:48,710
calibrated not just on their field and
specific situation but also on a state

9194
02:40:48,710 --> 02:40:48,720
specific situation but also on a state
 

9195
02:40:48,720 --> 02:40:51,650
specific situation but also on a state
of that field at a particular time in

9196
02:40:51,650 --> 02:40:51,660
of that field at a particular time in
 

9197
02:40:51,660 --> 02:40:54,830
of that field at a particular time in
the past so there's not many people in

9198
02:40:54,830 --> 02:40:54,840
the past so there's not many people in
 

9199
02:40:54,840 --> 02:40:56,650
the past so there's not many people in
this world that are able to achieve

9200
02:40:56,650 --> 02:40:56,660
this world that are able to achieve
 

9201
02:40:56,660 --> 02:40:59,030
this world that are able to achieve
revolutionary success multiple times in

9202
02:40:59,030 --> 02:40:59,040
revolutionary success multiple times in
 

9203
02:40:59,040 --> 02:41:00,710
revolutionary success multiple times in
their life so whenever you say somebody

9204
02:41:00,710 --> 02:41:00,720
their life so whenever you say somebody
 

9205
02:41:00,720 --> 02:41:03,290
their life so whenever you say somebody
very smart usually what that means is

9206
02:41:03,290 --> 02:41:03,300
very smart usually what that means is
 

9207
02:41:03,300 --> 02:41:06,110
very smart usually what that means is
somebody who's smart who achieved the

9208
02:41:06,110 --> 02:41:06,120
somebody who's smart who achieved the
 

9209
02:41:06,120 --> 02:41:08,809
somebody who's smart who achieved the
success at certain point in their life

9210
02:41:08,809 --> 02:41:08,819
success at certain point in their life
 

9211
02:41:08,819 --> 02:41:11,510
success at certain point in their life
and people often get stuck in that place

9212
02:41:11,510 --> 02:41:11,520
and people often get stuck in that place
 

9213
02:41:11,520 --> 02:41:13,790
and people often get stuck in that place
where they found success to be

9214
02:41:13,790 --> 02:41:13,800
where they found success to be
 

9215
02:41:13,800 --> 02:41:15,650
where they found success to be
constantly challenging your world view

9216
02:41:15,650 --> 02:41:15,660
constantly challenging your world view
 

9217
02:41:15,660 --> 02:41:18,170
constantly challenging your world view
is a very difficult thing

9218
02:41:18,170 --> 02:41:18,180
is a very difficult thing
 

9219
02:41:18,180 --> 02:41:21,110
is a very difficult thing
um so yeah and that also at the same

9220
02:41:21,110 --> 02:41:21,120
um so yeah and that also at the same
 

9221
02:41:21,120 --> 02:41:24,889
um so yeah and that also at the same
time probably if a lot of people tell

9222
02:41:24,889 --> 02:41:24,899
time probably if a lot of people tell
 

9223
02:41:24,899 --> 02:41:27,050
time probably if a lot of people tell
that's the weird thing about life if a

9224
02:41:27,050 --> 02:41:27,060
that's the weird thing about life if a
 

9225
02:41:27,060 --> 02:41:28,790
that's the weird thing about life if a
lot of people tell you

9226
02:41:28,790 --> 02:41:28,800
lot of people tell you
 

9227
02:41:28,800 --> 02:41:31,429
lot of people tell you
that something is stupid or is not going

9228
02:41:31,429 --> 02:41:31,439
that something is stupid or is not going
 

9229
02:41:31,439 --> 02:41:32,750
that something is stupid or is not going
to work

9230
02:41:32,750 --> 02:41:32,760
to work
 

9231
02:41:32,760 --> 02:41:34,910
to work
that either means it's stupid it's not

9232
02:41:34,910 --> 02:41:34,920
that either means it's stupid it's not
 

9233
02:41:34,920 --> 02:41:36,950
that either means it's stupid it's not
going to work or

9234
02:41:36,950 --> 02:41:36,960
going to work or
 

9235
02:41:36,960 --> 02:41:39,349
going to work or
it's actually a great opportunity to do

9236
02:41:39,349 --> 02:41:39,359
it's actually a great opportunity to do
 

9237
02:41:39,359 --> 02:41:41,389
it's actually a great opportunity to do
something new

9238
02:41:41,389 --> 02:41:41,399
something new
 

9239
02:41:41,399 --> 02:41:43,790
something new
and you don't know which one it is it's

9240
02:41:43,790 --> 02:41:43,800
and you don't know which one it is it's
 

9241
02:41:43,800 --> 02:41:46,010
and you don't know which one it is it's
probably equally likely to be either if

9242
02:41:46,010 --> 02:41:46,020
probably equally likely to be either if
 

9243
02:41:46,020 --> 02:41:49,030
probably equally likely to be either if
no well I don't know the probabilities

9244
02:41:49,030 --> 02:41:49,040
no well I don't know the probabilities
 

9245
02:41:49,040 --> 02:41:51,170
no well I don't know the probabilities
depends how lucky you are it depends how

9246
02:41:51,170 --> 02:41:51,180
depends how lucky you are it depends how
 

9247
02:41:51,180 --> 02:41:53,030
depends how lucky you are it depends how
brilliant you are but you don't know and

9248
02:41:53,030 --> 02:41:53,040
brilliant you are but you don't know and
 

9249
02:41:53,040 --> 02:41:55,130
brilliant you are but you don't know and
so you can't take that advice as actual

9250
02:41:55,130 --> 02:41:55,140
so you can't take that advice as actual
 

9251
02:41:55,140 --> 02:41:57,349
so you can't take that advice as actual
data yeah you have to um you have to and

9252
02:41:57,349 --> 02:41:57,359
data yeah you have to um you have to and
 

9253
02:41:57,359 --> 02:41:58,969
data yeah you have to um you have to and
this is this is kind of hard and fuzzy

9254
02:41:58,969 --> 02:41:58,979
this is this is kind of hard and fuzzy
 

9255
02:41:58,979 --> 02:42:01,610
this is this is kind of hard and fuzzy
like hard to describe and fuzzy but I

9256
02:42:01,610 --> 02:42:01,620
like hard to describe and fuzzy but I
 

9257
02:42:01,620 --> 02:42:04,670
like hard to describe and fuzzy but I
I'm uh a firm believer that you have to

9258
02:42:04,670 --> 02:42:04,680
I'm uh a firm believer that you have to
 

9259
02:42:04,680 --> 02:42:07,130
I'm uh a firm believer that you have to
uh build up your own intuition so over

9260
02:42:07,130 --> 02:42:07,140
uh build up your own intuition so over
 

9261
02:42:07,140 --> 02:42:08,929
uh build up your own intuition so over
time right you have to take your own

9262
02:42:08,929 --> 02:42:08,939
time right you have to take your own
 

9263
02:42:08,939 --> 02:42:10,429
time right you have to take your own
risks that seem like they make sense to

9264
02:42:10,429 --> 02:42:10,439
risks that seem like they make sense to
 

9265
02:42:10,439 --> 02:42:12,410
risks that seem like they make sense to
you and then learn from that and build

9266
02:42:12,410 --> 02:42:12,420
you and then learn from that and build
 

9267
02:42:12,420 --> 02:42:15,410
you and then learn from that and build
up so that you can trust your own gut

9268
02:42:15,410 --> 02:42:15,420
up so that you can trust your own gut
 

9269
02:42:15,420 --> 02:42:17,690
up so that you can trust your own gut
about what's a good idea even when and

9270
02:42:17,690 --> 02:42:17,700
about what's a good idea even when and
 

9271
02:42:17,700 --> 02:42:18,889
about what's a good idea even when and
then sometimes you'll make mistakes and

9272
02:42:18,889 --> 02:42:18,899
then sometimes you'll make mistakes and
 

9273
02:42:18,899 --> 02:42:20,030
then sometimes you'll make mistakes and
they'll turn out to be a dead end and

9274
02:42:20,030 --> 02:42:20,040
they'll turn out to be a dead end and
 

9275
02:42:20,040 --> 02:42:21,230
they'll turn out to be a dead end and
that's fine that's that's science but

9276
02:42:21,230 --> 02:42:21,240
that's fine that's that's science but
 

9277
02:42:21,240 --> 02:42:24,230
that's fine that's that's science but
but um you know what I tell my students

9278
02:42:24,230 --> 02:42:24,240
but um you know what I tell my students
 

9279
02:42:24,240 --> 02:42:27,590
but um you know what I tell my students
is is uh life is hard and science is is

9280
02:42:27,590 --> 02:42:27,600
is is uh life is hard and science is is
 

9281
02:42:27,600 --> 02:42:29,090
is is uh life is hard and science is is
hard and you're going to sweat and bleed

9282
02:42:29,090 --> 02:42:29,100
hard and you're going to sweat and bleed
 

9283
02:42:29,100 --> 02:42:31,130
hard and you're going to sweat and bleed
and everything and you should be doing

9284
02:42:31,130 --> 02:42:31,140
and everything and you should be doing
 

9285
02:42:31,140 --> 02:42:34,849
and everything and you should be doing
that for uh ideas that that really fire

9286
02:42:34,849 --> 02:42:34,859
that for uh ideas that that really fire
 

9287
02:42:34,859 --> 02:42:37,730
that for uh ideas that that really fire
you up inside and and um you know and

9288
02:42:37,730 --> 02:42:37,740
you up inside and and um you know and
 

9289
02:42:37,740 --> 02:42:40,910
you up inside and and um you know and
and really don't let uh kind of the uh

9290
02:42:40,910 --> 02:42:40,920
and really don't let uh kind of the uh
 

9291
02:42:40,920 --> 02:42:43,510
and really don't let uh kind of the uh
the the common denominator of

9292
02:42:43,510 --> 02:42:43,520
the the common denominator of
 

9293
02:42:43,520 --> 02:42:46,130
the the common denominator of
standardized approaches to things slow

9294
02:42:46,130 --> 02:42:46,140
standardized approaches to things slow
 

9295
02:42:46,140 --> 02:42:47,150
standardized approaches to things slow
you down

9296
02:42:47,150 --> 02:42:47,160
you down
 

9297
02:42:47,160 --> 02:42:49,429
you down
so you mentioned planaria being in some

9298
02:42:49,429 --> 02:42:49,439
so you mentioned planaria being in some
 

9299
02:42:49,439 --> 02:42:51,710
so you mentioned planaria being in some
sense Immortal what's the role of death

9300
02:42:51,710 --> 02:42:51,720
sense Immortal what's the role of death
 

9301
02:42:51,720 --> 02:42:53,150
sense Immortal what's the role of death
in life

9302
02:42:53,150 --> 02:42:53,160
in life
 

9303
02:42:53,160 --> 02:42:55,309
in life
what's the role of death in this whole

9304
02:42:55,309 --> 02:42:55,319
what's the role of death in this whole
 

9305
02:42:55,319 --> 02:42:57,590
what's the role of death in this whole
process we have is is it uh when you

9306
02:42:57,590 --> 02:42:57,600
process we have is is it uh when you
 

9307
02:42:57,600 --> 02:43:00,290
process we have is is it uh when you
look at biological systems

9308
02:43:00,290 --> 02:43:00,300
look at biological systems
 

9309
02:43:00,300 --> 02:43:02,630
look at biological systems
is death an important feature

9310
02:43:02,630 --> 02:43:02,640
is death an important feature
 

9311
02:43:02,640 --> 02:43:06,110
is death an important feature
especially as you climb up the hierarchy

9312
02:43:06,110 --> 02:43:06,120
especially as you climb up the hierarchy
 

9313
02:43:06,120 --> 02:43:09,650
especially as you climb up the hierarchy
of uh competency boy that's an

9314
02:43:09,650 --> 02:43:09,660
of uh competency boy that's an
 

9315
02:43:09,660 --> 02:43:10,849
of uh competency boy that's an
interesting question

9316
02:43:10,849 --> 02:43:10,859
interesting question
 

9317
02:43:10,859 --> 02:43:14,330
interesting question
um I think that uh it's certainly a

9318
02:43:14,330 --> 02:43:14,340
um I think that uh it's certainly a
 

9319
02:43:14,340 --> 02:43:18,830
um I think that uh it's certainly a
factor that promotes change and turnover

9320
02:43:18,830 --> 02:43:18,840
factor that promotes change and turnover
 

9321
02:43:18,840 --> 02:43:21,590
factor that promotes change and turnover
and an opportunity to do something

9322
02:43:21,590 --> 02:43:21,600
and an opportunity to do something
 

9323
02:43:21,600 --> 02:43:23,710
and an opportunity to do something
different the next time

9324
02:43:23,710 --> 02:43:23,720
different the next time
 

9325
02:43:23,720 --> 02:43:26,809
different the next time
for a larger scale system so apoptosis

9326
02:43:26,809 --> 02:43:26,819
for a larger scale system so apoptosis
 

9327
02:43:26,819 --> 02:43:28,610
for a larger scale system so apoptosis
you know it's really interesting I mean

9328
02:43:28,610 --> 02:43:28,620
you know it's really interesting I mean
 

9329
02:43:28,620 --> 02:43:29,990
you know it's really interesting I mean
death is really interesting in a number

9330
02:43:29,990 --> 02:43:30,000
death is really interesting in a number
 

9331
02:43:30,000 --> 02:43:31,730
death is really interesting in a number
of ways one is like you could think

9332
02:43:31,730 --> 02:43:31,740
of ways one is like you could think
 

9333
02:43:31,740 --> 02:43:33,469
of ways one is like you could think
about like what was the first thing to

9334
02:43:33,469 --> 02:43:33,479
about like what was the first thing to
 

9335
02:43:33,479 --> 02:43:35,630
about like what was the first thing to
die you know that's that's an

9336
02:43:35,630 --> 02:43:35,640
die you know that's that's an
 

9337
02:43:35,640 --> 02:43:36,830
die you know that's that's an
interesting question what was the first

9338
02:43:36,830 --> 02:43:36,840
interesting question what was the first
 

9339
02:43:36,840 --> 02:43:38,210
interesting question what was the first
creature that you could say actually die

9340
02:43:38,210 --> 02:43:38,220
creature that you could say actually die
 

9341
02:43:38,220 --> 02:43:40,790
creature that you could say actually die
it's a tough it's a tough thing because

9342
02:43:40,790 --> 02:43:40,800
it's a tough it's a tough thing because
 

9343
02:43:40,800 --> 02:43:42,889
it's a tough it's a tough thing because
we don't have a great definition for it

9344
02:43:42,889 --> 02:43:42,899
we don't have a great definition for it
 

9345
02:43:42,899 --> 02:43:45,770
we don't have a great definition for it
so if you bring a a cabbage home and you

9346
02:43:45,770 --> 02:43:45,780
so if you bring a a cabbage home and you
 

9347
02:43:45,780 --> 02:43:47,450
so if you bring a a cabbage home and you
put it in your fridge

9348
02:43:47,450 --> 02:43:47,460
put it in your fridge
 

9349
02:43:47,460 --> 02:43:49,309
put it in your fridge
at what point are you gonna say it's

9350
02:43:49,309 --> 02:43:49,319
at what point are you gonna say it's
 

9351
02:43:49,319 --> 02:43:51,349
at what point are you gonna say it's
died you're right then so so that's it's

9352
02:43:51,349 --> 02:43:51,359
died you're right then so so that's it's
 

9353
02:43:51,359 --> 02:43:52,730
died you're right then so so that's it's
kind of hard

9354
02:43:52,730 --> 02:43:52,740
kind of hard
 

9355
02:43:52,740 --> 02:43:56,450
kind of hard
um to know there's also there's also uh

9356
02:43:56,450 --> 02:43:56,460
um to know there's also there's also uh
 

9357
02:43:56,460 --> 02:43:58,550
um to know there's also there's also uh
the the there's there's one paper in

9358
02:43:58,550 --> 02:43:58,560
the the there's there's one paper in
 

9359
02:43:58,560 --> 02:44:00,110
the the there's there's one paper in
which I talk about this idea that I mean

9360
02:44:00,110 --> 02:44:00,120
which I talk about this idea that I mean
 

9361
02:44:00,120 --> 02:44:02,090
which I talk about this idea that I mean
think about think about this and and

9362
02:44:02,090 --> 02:44:02,100
think about think about this and and
 

9363
02:44:02,100 --> 02:44:04,490
think about think about this and and
imagine that uh you have you have a

9364
02:44:04,490 --> 02:44:04,500
imagine that uh you have you have a
 

9365
02:44:04,500 --> 02:44:06,650
imagine that uh you have you have a
creature uh that's aquatic let's say

9366
02:44:06,650 --> 02:44:06,660
creature uh that's aquatic let's say
 

9367
02:44:06,660 --> 02:44:08,090
creature uh that's aquatic let's say
let's say it's a it's a frog or

9368
02:44:08,090 --> 02:44:08,100
let's say it's a it's a frog or
 

9369
02:44:08,100 --> 02:44:10,670
let's say it's a it's a frog or
something or a tadpole and the animal

9370
02:44:10,670 --> 02:44:10,680
something or a tadpole and the animal
 

9371
02:44:10,680 --> 02:44:13,130
something or a tadpole and the animal
dies in the in the pond it dies for

9372
02:44:13,130 --> 02:44:13,140
dies in the in the pond it dies for
 

9373
02:44:13,140 --> 02:44:14,170
dies in the in the pond it dies for
whatever reason

9374
02:44:14,170 --> 02:44:14,180
whatever reason
 

9375
02:44:14,180 --> 02:44:17,630
whatever reason
most of the cells are still alive so you

9376
02:44:17,630 --> 02:44:17,640
most of the cells are still alive so you
 

9377
02:44:17,640 --> 02:44:19,550
most of the cells are still alive so you
could imagine that if when it died there

9378
02:44:19,550 --> 02:44:19,560
could imagine that if when it died there
 

9379
02:44:19,560 --> 02:44:21,410
could imagine that if when it died there
was some sort of um breakdown of of of

9380
02:44:21,410 --> 02:44:21,420
was some sort of um breakdown of of of
 

9381
02:44:21,420 --> 02:44:23,450
was some sort of um breakdown of of of
of the of the connectivity between the

9382
02:44:23,450 --> 02:44:23,460
of the of the connectivity between the
 

9383
02:44:23,460 --> 02:44:26,270
of the of the connectivity between the
cells a bunch of cells crawled off they

9384
02:44:26,270 --> 02:44:26,280
cells a bunch of cells crawled off they
 

9385
02:44:26,280 --> 02:44:28,790
cells a bunch of cells crawled off they
could have a life as amoebas they some

9386
02:44:28,790 --> 02:44:28,800
could have a life as amoebas they some
 

9387
02:44:28,800 --> 02:44:30,469
could have a life as amoebas they some
of them could join together and become a

9388
02:44:30,469 --> 02:44:30,479
of them could join together and become a
 

9389
02:44:30,479 --> 02:44:33,110
of them could join together and become a
zenabot and toodle around right so we

9390
02:44:33,110 --> 02:44:33,120
zenabot and toodle around right so we
 

9391
02:44:33,120 --> 02:44:34,610
zenabot and toodle around right so we
know from planaria that there are cells

9392
02:44:34,610 --> 02:44:34,620
know from planaria that there are cells
 

9393
02:44:34,620 --> 02:44:36,050
know from planaria that there are cells
that don't obey the hayflick limit and

9394
02:44:36,050 --> 02:44:36,060
that don't obey the hayflick limit and
 

9395
02:44:36,060 --> 02:44:37,969
that don't obey the hayflick limit and
just sort of live live forever so you

9396
02:44:37,969 --> 02:44:37,979
just sort of live live forever so you
 

9397
02:44:37,979 --> 02:44:39,469
just sort of live live forever so you
could imagine an organism that when the

9398
02:44:39,469 --> 02:44:39,479
could imagine an organism that when the
 

9399
02:44:39,479 --> 02:44:41,389
could imagine an organism that when the
organism dies it doesn't disappear

9400
02:44:41,389 --> 02:44:41,399
organism dies it doesn't disappear
 

9401
02:44:41,399 --> 02:44:43,190
organism dies it doesn't disappear
rather the individual cells that are

9402
02:44:43,190 --> 02:44:43,200
rather the individual cells that are
 

9403
02:44:43,200 --> 02:44:45,230
rather the individual cells that are
still alive crawl off and have a

9404
02:44:45,230 --> 02:44:45,240
still alive crawl off and have a
 

9405
02:44:45,240 --> 02:44:46,309
still alive crawl off and have a
completely different kind of lifestyle

9406
02:44:46,309 --> 02:44:46,319
completely different kind of lifestyle
 

9407
02:44:46,319 --> 02:44:47,630
completely different kind of lifestyle
and maybe come back together as

9408
02:44:47,630 --> 02:44:47,640
and maybe come back together as
 

9409
02:44:47,640 --> 02:44:49,670
and maybe come back together as
something else or maybe they don't so so

9410
02:44:49,670 --> 02:44:49,680
something else or maybe they don't so so
 

9411
02:44:49,680 --> 02:44:50,870
something else or maybe they don't so so
all of this I'm sure is happening

9412
02:44:50,870 --> 02:44:50,880
all of this I'm sure is happening
 

9413
02:44:50,880 --> 02:44:52,730
all of this I'm sure is happening
somewhere on some on some on some Planet

9414
02:44:52,730 --> 02:44:52,740
somewhere on some on some on some Planet
 

9415
02:44:52,740 --> 02:44:54,349
somewhere on some on some on some Planet
so so

9416
02:44:54,349 --> 02:44:54,359
so so
 

9417
02:44:54,359 --> 02:44:56,929
so so
um death in any case I mean we already

9418
02:44:56,929 --> 02:44:56,939
um death in any case I mean we already
 

9419
02:44:56,939 --> 02:44:58,250
um death in any case I mean we already
kind of knew this because the molecules

9420
02:44:58,250 --> 02:44:58,260
kind of knew this because the molecules
 

9421
02:44:58,260 --> 02:44:59,990
kind of knew this because the molecules
we you know we know with something nice

9422
02:44:59,990 --> 02:45:00,000
we you know we know with something nice
 

9423
02:45:00,000 --> 02:45:01,490
we you know we know with something nice
the molecules go through the ecosystem

9424
02:45:01,490 --> 02:45:01,500
the molecules go through the ecosystem
 

9425
02:45:01,500 --> 02:45:04,670
the molecules go through the ecosystem
but even the cells don't necessarily die

9426
02:45:04,670 --> 02:45:04,680
but even the cells don't necessarily die
 

9427
02:45:04,680 --> 02:45:05,870
but even the cells don't necessarily die
at that point they might have another

9428
02:45:05,870 --> 02:45:05,880
at that point they might have another
 

9429
02:45:05,880 --> 02:45:07,730
at that point they might have another
life in a different uh in a different

9430
02:45:07,730 --> 02:45:07,740
life in a different uh in a different
 

9431
02:45:07,740 --> 02:45:09,110
life in a different uh in a different
way you can think about something like

9432
02:45:09,110 --> 02:45:09,120
way you can think about something like
 

9433
02:45:09,120 --> 02:45:11,270
way you can think about something like
Gila right The Gila cell line you know

9434
02:45:11,270 --> 02:45:11,280
Gila right The Gila cell line you know
 

9435
02:45:11,280 --> 02:45:13,010
Gila right The Gila cell line you know
that has this that's had this incredible

9436
02:45:13,010 --> 02:45:13,020
that has this that's had this incredible
 

9437
02:45:13,020 --> 02:45:15,650
that has this that's had this incredible
life uh there are way more Hela cells

9438
02:45:15,650 --> 02:45:15,660
life uh there are way more Hela cells
 

9439
02:45:15,660 --> 02:45:17,270
life uh there are way more Hela cells
now than there ever been than there than

9440
02:45:17,270 --> 02:45:17,280
now than there ever been than there than
 

9441
02:45:17,280 --> 02:45:19,130
now than there ever been than there than
there were when when she was alive it

9442
02:45:19,130 --> 02:45:19,140
there were when when she was alive it
 

9443
02:45:19,140 --> 02:45:20,870
there were when when she was alive it
seems like as the organisms become more

9444
02:45:20,870 --> 02:45:20,880
seems like as the organisms become more
 

9445
02:45:20,880 --> 02:45:22,429
seems like as the organisms become more
and more complex like if you look at the

9446
02:45:22,429 --> 02:45:22,439
and more complex like if you look at the
 

9447
02:45:22,439 --> 02:45:24,309
and more complex like if you look at the
mammals their relationship with death

9448
02:45:24,309 --> 02:45:24,319
mammals their relationship with death
 

9449
02:45:24,319 --> 02:45:27,170
mammals their relationship with death
becomes more and more complex

9450
02:45:27,170 --> 02:45:27,180
becomes more and more complex
 

9451
02:45:27,180 --> 02:45:30,469
becomes more and more complex
so the survival imperative starts

9452
02:45:30,469 --> 02:45:30,479
so the survival imperative starts
 

9453
02:45:30,479 --> 02:45:32,870
so the survival imperative starts
becoming interesting and humans

9454
02:45:32,870 --> 02:45:32,880
becoming interesting and humans
 

9455
02:45:32,880 --> 02:45:36,349
becoming interesting and humans
are arguably the first species

9456
02:45:36,349 --> 02:45:36,359
are arguably the first species
 

9457
02:45:36,359 --> 02:45:40,070
are arguably the first species
that have invented the fear of death the

9458
02:45:40,070 --> 02:45:40,080
that have invented the fear of death the
 

9459
02:45:40,080 --> 02:45:41,630
that have invented the fear of death the
understanding that you're going to die

9460
02:45:41,630 --> 02:45:41,640
understanding that you're going to die
 

9461
02:45:41,640 --> 02:45:44,389
understanding that you're going to die
let's put it this way like a long-term

9462
02:45:44,389 --> 02:45:44,399
let's put it this way like a long-term
 

9463
02:45:44,399 --> 02:45:47,870
let's put it this way like a long-term
so not like ins instinctual like I need

9464
02:45:47,870 --> 02:45:47,880
so not like ins instinctual like I need
 

9465
02:45:47,880 --> 02:45:49,730
so not like ins instinctual like I need
to run away from the thing that's going

9466
02:45:49,730 --> 02:45:49,740
to run away from the thing that's going
 

9467
02:45:49,740 --> 02:45:52,250
to run away from the thing that's going
to eat me but starting to contemplate

9468
02:45:52,250 --> 02:45:52,260
to eat me but starting to contemplate
 

9469
02:45:52,260 --> 02:45:55,190
to eat me but starting to contemplate
the finiteness of Life yeah I mean one

9470
02:45:55,190 --> 02:45:55,200
the finiteness of Life yeah I mean one
 

9471
02:45:55,200 --> 02:45:57,710
the finiteness of Life yeah I mean one
thing so one thing about the human light

9472
02:45:57,710 --> 02:45:57,720
thing so one thing about the human light
 

9473
02:45:57,720 --> 02:46:00,410
thing so one thing about the human light
cognitive light cone is that for the

9474
02:46:00,410 --> 02:46:00,420
cognitive light cone is that for the
 

9475
02:46:00,420 --> 02:46:02,210
cognitive light cone is that for the
first as far as we know for the first

9476
02:46:02,210 --> 02:46:02,220
first as far as we know for the first
 

9477
02:46:02,220 --> 02:46:04,550
first as far as we know for the first
time you might have goals that are

9478
02:46:04,550 --> 02:46:04,560
time you might have goals that are
 

9479
02:46:04,560 --> 02:46:05,929
time you might have goals that are
longer than your life that are not

9480
02:46:05,929 --> 02:46:05,939
longer than your life that are not
 

9481
02:46:05,939 --> 02:46:07,910
longer than your life that are not
achievable right so if you're if you're

9482
02:46:07,910 --> 02:46:07,920
achievable right so if you're if you're
 

9483
02:46:07,920 --> 02:46:09,349
achievable right so if you're if you're
let's say and I I don't know if this is

9484
02:46:09,349 --> 02:46:09,359
let's say and I I don't know if this is
 

9485
02:46:09,359 --> 02:46:11,090
let's say and I I don't know if this is
true but if if you're of goldfish and

9486
02:46:11,090 --> 02:46:11,100
true but if if you're of goldfish and
 

9487
02:46:11,100 --> 02:46:12,950
true but if if you're of goldfish and
you have a 10 minute attention span I'm

9488
02:46:12,950 --> 02:46:12,960
you have a 10 minute attention span I'm
 

9489
02:46:12,960 --> 02:46:14,210
you have a 10 minute attention span I'm
not sure if that's true but let's say

9490
02:46:14,210 --> 02:46:14,220
not sure if that's true but let's say
 

9491
02:46:14,220 --> 02:46:15,590
not sure if that's true but let's say
let's say there's some organism with a

9492
02:46:15,590 --> 02:46:15,600
let's say there's some organism with a
 

9493
02:46:15,600 --> 02:46:17,030
let's say there's some organism with a
with a short um you know kind of

9494
02:46:17,030 --> 02:46:17,040
with a short um you know kind of
 

9495
02:46:17,040 --> 02:46:18,889
with a short um you know kind of
cognitive light cone that way

9496
02:46:18,889 --> 02:46:18,899
cognitive light cone that way
 

9497
02:46:18,899 --> 02:46:20,870
cognitive light cone that way
all of your goals are potentially

9498
02:46:20,870 --> 02:46:20,880
all of your goals are potentially
 

9499
02:46:20,880 --> 02:46:22,429
all of your goals are potentially
achievable because you're probably going

9500
02:46:22,429 --> 02:46:22,439
achievable because you're probably going
 

9501
02:46:22,439 --> 02:46:23,630
achievable because you're probably going
to live the next 10 minutes so whatever

9502
02:46:23,630 --> 02:46:23,640
to live the next 10 minutes so whatever
 

9503
02:46:23,640 --> 02:46:25,070
to live the next 10 minutes so whatever
goals you have they are totally

9504
02:46:25,070 --> 02:46:25,080
goals you have they are totally
 

9505
02:46:25,080 --> 02:46:27,110
goals you have they are totally
achievable if you're a human you could

9506
02:46:27,110 --> 02:46:27,120
achievable if you're a human you could
 

9507
02:46:27,120 --> 02:46:28,370
achievable if you're a human you could
have all kinds of goals that are

9508
02:46:28,370 --> 02:46:28,380
have all kinds of goals that are
 

9509
02:46:28,380 --> 02:46:30,050
have all kinds of goals that are
guaranteed not achievable because they

9510
02:46:30,050 --> 02:46:30,060
guaranteed not achievable because they
 

9511
02:46:30,060 --> 02:46:31,370
guaranteed not achievable because they
just take too long like guaranteed

9512
02:46:31,370 --> 02:46:31,380
just take too long like guaranteed
 

9513
02:46:31,380 --> 02:46:32,630
just take too long like guaranteed
you're not going to achieve them so I

9514
02:46:32,630 --> 02:46:32,640
you're not going to achieve them so I
 

9515
02:46:32,640 --> 02:46:35,330
you're not going to achieve them so I
wonder if you know is that is that a per

9516
02:46:35,330 --> 02:46:35,340
wonder if you know is that is that a per
 

9517
02:46:35,340 --> 02:46:37,370
wonder if you know is that is that a per
you know like a perennial um you know

9518
02:46:37,370 --> 02:46:37,380
you know like a perennial um you know
 

9519
02:46:37,380 --> 02:46:38,929
you know like a perennial um you know
sort of thorn in our in our psychology

9520
02:46:38,929 --> 02:46:38,939
sort of thorn in our in our psychology
 

9521
02:46:38,939 --> 02:46:40,849
sort of thorn in our in our psychology
that drives some some psychosis or

9522
02:46:40,849 --> 02:46:40,859
that drives some some psychosis or
 

9523
02:46:40,859 --> 02:46:42,530
that drives some some psychosis or
whatever I have no idea another

9524
02:46:42,530 --> 02:46:42,540
whatever I have no idea another
 

9525
02:46:42,540 --> 02:46:43,969
whatever I have no idea another
interesting thing about that actually

9526
02:46:43,969 --> 02:46:43,979
interesting thing about that actually
 

9527
02:46:43,979 --> 02:46:45,950
interesting thing about that actually
I've been thinking about this a lot in

9528
02:46:45,950 --> 02:46:45,960
I've been thinking about this a lot in
 

9529
02:46:45,960 --> 02:46:47,990
I've been thinking about this a lot in
the last couple of weeks this notion of

9530
02:46:47,990 --> 02:46:48,000
the last couple of weeks this notion of
 

9531
02:46:48,000 --> 02:46:52,510
the last couple of weeks this notion of
giving up so you would think that

9532
02:46:52,510 --> 02:46:52,520
giving up so you would think that
 

9533
02:46:52,520 --> 02:46:56,690
giving up so you would think that
evolutionarily the most um adaptive way

9534
02:46:56,690 --> 02:46:56,700
evolutionarily the most um adaptive way
 

9535
02:46:56,700 --> 02:46:59,750
evolutionarily the most um adaptive way
of being is that you go you you you

9536
02:46:59,750 --> 02:46:59,760
of being is that you go you you you
 

9537
02:46:59,760 --> 02:47:02,330
of being is that you go you you you
fight as long as you physically can and

9538
02:47:02,330 --> 02:47:02,340
fight as long as you physically can and
 

9539
02:47:02,340 --> 02:47:03,410
fight as long as you physically can and
then when you can't you can't and

9540
02:47:03,410 --> 02:47:03,420
then when you can't you can't and
 

9541
02:47:03,420 --> 02:47:04,550
then when you can't you can't and
there's in there's this Photograph

9542
02:47:04,550 --> 02:47:04,560
there's in there's this Photograph
 

9543
02:47:04,560 --> 02:47:06,230
there's in there's this Photograph
there's some videos you can find of

9544
02:47:06,230 --> 02:47:06,240
there's some videos you can find of
 

9545
02:47:06,240 --> 02:47:08,090
there's some videos you can find of
insects crawling around where like you

9546
02:47:08,090 --> 02:47:08,100
insects crawling around where like you
 

9547
02:47:08,100 --> 02:47:09,349
insects crawling around where like you
know this like like most of it is

9548
02:47:09,349 --> 02:47:09,359
know this like like most of it is
 

9549
02:47:09,359 --> 02:47:10,670
know this like like most of it is
already gone and it's still sort of

9550
02:47:10,670 --> 02:47:10,680
already gone and it's still sort of
 

9551
02:47:10,680 --> 02:47:12,349
already gone and it's still sort of
crawling you know like

9552
02:47:12,349 --> 02:47:12,359
crawling you know like
 

9553
02:47:12,359 --> 02:47:14,510
crawling you know like
um um a Terminator style right like as

9554
02:47:14,510 --> 02:47:14,520
um um a Terminator style right like as
 

9555
02:47:14,520 --> 02:47:16,130
um um a Terminator style right like as
far as as long as you physically can you

9556
02:47:16,130 --> 02:47:16,140
far as as long as you physically can you
 

9557
02:47:16,140 --> 02:47:17,230
far as as long as you physically can you
keep going

9558
02:47:17,230 --> 02:47:17,240
keep going
 

9559
02:47:17,240 --> 02:47:19,370
keep going
mammals don't do that so so a lot of

9560
02:47:19,370 --> 02:47:19,380
mammals don't do that so so a lot of
 

9561
02:47:19,380 --> 02:47:20,929
mammals don't do that so so a lot of
mammals including rats have this thing

9562
02:47:20,929 --> 02:47:20,939
mammals including rats have this thing
 

9563
02:47:20,939 --> 02:47:24,050
mammals including rats have this thing
where when when they think it's it's a

9564
02:47:24,050 --> 02:47:24,060
where when when they think it's it's a
 

9565
02:47:24,060 --> 02:47:26,090
where when when they think it's it's a
hopeless situation they literally give

9566
02:47:26,090 --> 02:47:26,100
hopeless situation they literally give
 

9567
02:47:26,100 --> 02:47:27,650
hopeless situation they literally give
up and die when physically they could

9568
02:47:27,650 --> 02:47:27,660
up and die when physically they could
 

9569
02:47:27,660 --> 02:47:29,210
up and die when physically they could
have kept going I mean humans certainly

9570
02:47:29,210 --> 02:47:29,220
have kept going I mean humans certainly
 

9571
02:47:29,220 --> 02:47:30,950
have kept going I mean humans certainly
do this and there's there's some like

9572
02:47:30,950 --> 02:47:30,960
do this and there's there's some like
 

9573
02:47:30,960 --> 02:47:32,570
do this and there's there's some like
really unpleasant experiments that the

9574
02:47:32,570 --> 02:47:32,580
really unpleasant experiments that the
 

9575
02:47:32,580 --> 02:47:34,130
really unpleasant experiments that the
the this guy forget his name did with

9576
02:47:34,130 --> 02:47:34,140
the this guy forget his name did with
 

9577
02:47:34,140 --> 02:47:36,469
the this guy forget his name did with
them drowning rats where if he where

9578
02:47:36,469 --> 02:47:36,479
them drowning rats where if he where
 

9579
02:47:36,479 --> 02:47:38,270
them drowning rats where if he where
where rats normally drown after a couple

9580
02:47:38,270 --> 02:47:38,280
where rats normally drown after a couple
 

9581
02:47:38,280 --> 02:47:40,070
where rats normally drown after a couple
of minutes but if you teach them that if

9582
02:47:40,070 --> 02:47:40,080
of minutes but if you teach them that if
 

9583
02:47:40,080 --> 02:47:41,330
of minutes but if you teach them that if
you just tread water for a couple of

9584
02:47:41,330 --> 02:47:41,340
you just tread water for a couple of
 

9585
02:47:41,340 --> 02:47:42,770
you just tread water for a couple of
minutes you'll get rescued they can

9586
02:47:42,770 --> 02:47:42,780
minutes you'll get rescued they can
 

9587
02:47:42,780 --> 02:47:44,510
minutes you'll get rescued they can
tread water for like an hour and so

9588
02:47:44,510 --> 02:47:44,520
tread water for like an hour and so
 

9589
02:47:44,520 --> 02:47:45,889
tread water for like an hour and so
right and so they literally just give up

9590
02:47:45,889 --> 02:47:45,899
right and so they literally just give up
 

9591
02:47:45,899 --> 02:47:48,710
right and so they literally just give up
and die and so evolutionarily that

9592
02:47:48,710 --> 02:47:48,720
and die and so evolutionarily that
 

9593
02:47:48,720 --> 02:47:50,270
and die and so evolutionarily that
doesn't seem like a good strategy at all

9594
02:47:50,270 --> 02:47:50,280
doesn't seem like a good strategy at all
 

9595
02:47:50,280 --> 02:47:51,889
doesn't seem like a good strategy at all
evolutionarily since why would you like

9596
02:47:51,889 --> 02:47:51,899
evolutionarily since why would you like
 

9597
02:47:51,899 --> 02:47:53,510
evolutionarily since why would you like
what's the benefit ever of giving up you

9598
02:47:53,510 --> 02:47:53,520
what's the benefit ever of giving up you
 

9599
02:47:53,520 --> 02:47:54,830
what's the benefit ever of giving up you
just do what you can and you know one

9600
02:47:54,830 --> 02:47:54,840
just do what you can and you know one
 

9601
02:47:54,840 --> 02:47:55,969
just do what you can and you know one
time out of a thousand you'll actually

9602
02:47:55,969 --> 02:47:55,979
time out of a thousand you'll actually
 

9603
02:47:55,979 --> 02:47:58,610
time out of a thousand you'll actually
get rescued right but this issue of of

9604
02:47:58,610 --> 02:47:58,620
get rescued right but this issue of of
 

9605
02:47:58,620 --> 02:48:01,010
get rescued right but this issue of of
of actually giving up suggests some very

9606
02:48:01,010 --> 02:48:01,020
of actually giving up suggests some very
 

9607
02:48:01,020 --> 02:48:03,590
of actually giving up suggests some very
interesting metacognitive controls where

9608
02:48:03,590 --> 02:48:03,600
interesting metacognitive controls where
 

9609
02:48:03,600 --> 02:48:05,150
interesting metacognitive controls where
you've now gotten to the point where

9610
02:48:05,150 --> 02:48:05,160
you've now gotten to the point where
 

9611
02:48:05,160 --> 02:48:07,429
you've now gotten to the point where
survival actually isn't the top drive

9612
02:48:07,429 --> 02:48:07,439
survival actually isn't the top drive
 

9613
02:48:07,439 --> 02:48:09,650
survival actually isn't the top drive
and that for whatever you know there are

9614
02:48:09,650 --> 02:48:09,660
and that for whatever you know there are
 

9615
02:48:09,660 --> 02:48:11,030
and that for whatever you know there are
other considerations that have like

9616
02:48:11,030 --> 02:48:11,040
other considerations that have like
 

9617
02:48:11,040 --> 02:48:13,010
other considerations that have like
taken over and I I think that's uniquely

9618
02:48:13,010 --> 02:48:13,020
taken over and I I think that's uniquely
 

9619
02:48:13,020 --> 02:48:15,230
taken over and I I think that's uniquely
a mammalian thing but um I don't know

9620
02:48:15,230 --> 02:48:15,240
a mammalian thing but um I don't know
 

9621
02:48:15,240 --> 02:48:17,630
a mammalian thing but um I don't know
yeah the Camus

9622
02:48:17,630 --> 02:48:17,640
yeah the Camus
 

9623
02:48:17,640 --> 02:48:21,410
yeah the Camus
the existentialist question of Why Live

9624
02:48:21,410 --> 02:48:21,420
the existentialist question of Why Live
 

9625
02:48:21,420 --> 02:48:23,950
the existentialist question of Why Live
just the fact that humans commit suicide

9626
02:48:23,950 --> 02:48:23,960
just the fact that humans commit suicide
 

9627
02:48:23,960 --> 02:48:26,630
just the fact that humans commit suicide
is a really fascinating question from an

9628
02:48:26,630 --> 02:48:26,640
is a really fascinating question from an
 

9629
02:48:26,640 --> 02:48:28,490
is a really fascinating question from an
evolutionary perspective and what was

9630
02:48:28,490 --> 02:48:28,500
evolutionary perspective and what was
 

9631
02:48:28,500 --> 02:48:29,510
evolutionary perspective and what was
the first and that's the other thing

9632
02:48:29,510 --> 02:48:29,520
the first and that's the other thing
 

9633
02:48:29,520 --> 02:48:33,050
the first and that's the other thing
like what is the simplest uh system

9634
02:48:33,050 --> 02:48:33,060
like what is the simplest uh system
 

9635
02:48:33,060 --> 02:48:35,630
like what is the simplest uh system
whether whether evolved or you know

9636
02:48:35,630 --> 02:48:35,640
whether whether evolved or you know
 

9637
02:48:35,640 --> 02:48:37,490
whether whether evolved or you know
natural or whatever that is able to do

9638
02:48:37,490 --> 02:48:37,500
natural or whatever that is able to do
 

9639
02:48:37,500 --> 02:48:39,410
natural or whatever that is able to do
that right like you can think you know

9640
02:48:39,410 --> 02:48:39,420
that right like you can think you know
 

9641
02:48:39,420 --> 02:48:41,030
that right like you can think you know
what other animals are actually able to

9642
02:48:41,030 --> 02:48:41,040
what other animals are actually able to
 

9643
02:48:41,040 --> 02:48:43,790
what other animals are actually able to
do that I'm not sure maybe

9644
02:48:43,790 --> 02:48:43,800
do that I'm not sure maybe
 

9645
02:48:43,800 --> 02:48:46,849
do that I'm not sure maybe
you could see animals over time for some

9646
02:48:46,849 --> 02:48:46,859
you could see animals over time for some
 

9647
02:48:46,859 --> 02:48:50,150
you could see animals over time for some
reason lowering the value of survive at

9648
02:48:50,150 --> 02:48:50,160
reason lowering the value of survive at
 

9649
02:48:50,160 --> 02:48:53,090
reason lowering the value of survive at
all costs gradually until other

9650
02:48:53,090 --> 02:48:53,100
all costs gradually until other
 

9651
02:48:53,100 --> 02:48:55,610
all costs gradually until other
objectives might become more important

9652
02:48:55,610 --> 02:48:55,620
objectives might become more important
 

9653
02:48:55,620 --> 02:48:57,469
objectives might become more important
maybe I don't know how evolutionarily

9654
02:48:57,469 --> 02:48:57,479
maybe I don't know how evolutionarily
 

9655
02:48:57,479 --> 02:48:59,030
maybe I don't know how evolutionarily
how that how that gets off the ground

9656
02:48:59,030 --> 02:48:59,040
how that how that gets off the ground
 

9657
02:48:59,040 --> 02:49:00,290
how that how that gets off the ground
that just seems like that would have

9658
02:49:00,290 --> 02:49:00,300
that just seems like that would have
 

9659
02:49:00,300 --> 02:49:02,929
that just seems like that would have
such a strong pressure against it you

9660
02:49:02,929 --> 02:49:02,939
such a strong pressure against it you
 

9661
02:49:02,939 --> 02:49:05,270
such a strong pressure against it you
know

9662
02:49:05,270 --> 02:49:05,280

 

9663
02:49:05,280 --> 02:49:07,250

just imagine a you know a population

9664
02:49:07,250 --> 02:49:07,260
just imagine a you know a population
 

9665
02:49:07,260 --> 02:49:09,830
just imagine a you know a population
with with with a lower

9666
02:49:09,830 --> 02:49:09,840
with with with a lower
 

9667
02:49:09,840 --> 02:49:11,450
with with with a lower
um you know what what if if you were a

9668
02:49:11,450 --> 02:49:11,460
um you know what what if if you were a
 

9669
02:49:11,460 --> 02:49:13,730
um you know what what if if you were a
mutant in a population that had less of

9670
02:49:13,730 --> 02:49:13,740
mutant in a population that had less of
 

9671
02:49:13,740 --> 02:49:16,730
mutant in a population that had less of
a uh less of a survival imperative would

9672
02:49:16,730 --> 02:49:16,740
a uh less of a survival imperative would
 

9673
02:49:16,740 --> 02:49:18,950
a uh less of a survival imperative would
you would your genes outperform the

9674
02:49:18,950 --> 02:49:18,960
you would your genes outperform the
 

9675
02:49:18,960 --> 02:49:20,570
you would your genes outperform the
others it seems no is there such a thing

9676
02:49:20,570 --> 02:49:20,580
others it seems no is there such a thing
 

9677
02:49:20,580 --> 02:49:22,550
others it seems no is there such a thing
as population selection because maybe

9678
02:49:22,550 --> 02:49:22,560
as population selection because maybe
 

9679
02:49:22,560 --> 02:49:24,770
as population selection because maybe
suicide is a way

9680
02:49:24,770 --> 02:49:24,780
suicide is a way
 

9681
02:49:24,780 --> 02:49:27,830
suicide is a way
uh for organisms to decide that

9682
02:49:27,830 --> 02:49:27,840
uh for organisms to decide that
 

9683
02:49:27,840 --> 02:49:29,750
uh for organisms to decide that
themselves that they're not

9684
02:49:29,750 --> 02:49:29,760
themselves that they're not
 

9685
02:49:29,760 --> 02:49:32,450
themselves that they're not
fit for the environment somehow yeah

9686
02:49:32,450 --> 02:49:32,460
fit for the environment somehow yeah
 

9687
02:49:32,460 --> 02:49:34,730
fit for the environment somehow yeah
that's a that's a really uh country you

9688
02:49:34,730 --> 02:49:34,740
that's a that's a really uh country you
 

9689
02:49:34,740 --> 02:49:36,590
that's a that's a really uh country you
know population level selection is a is

9690
02:49:36,590 --> 02:49:36,600
know population level selection is a is
 

9691
02:49:36,600 --> 02:49:38,809
know population level selection is a is
a kind of a deep controversial area but

9692
02:49:38,809 --> 02:49:38,819
a kind of a deep controversial area but
 

9693
02:49:38,819 --> 02:49:42,290
a kind of a deep controversial area but
it's tough because on the face of it if

9694
02:49:42,290 --> 02:49:42,300
it's tough because on the face of it if
 

9695
02:49:42,300 --> 02:49:44,210
it's tough because on the face of it if
that was your genome it wouldn't get

9696
02:49:44,210 --> 02:49:44,220
that was your genome it wouldn't get
 

9697
02:49:44,220 --> 02:49:46,130
that was your genome it wouldn't get
propagated because you would die and

9698
02:49:46,130 --> 02:49:46,140
propagated because you would die and
 

9699
02:49:46,140 --> 02:49:47,510
propagated because you would die and
then your neighbor who didn't have that

9700
02:49:47,510 --> 02:49:47,520
then your neighbor who didn't have that
 

9701
02:49:47,520 --> 02:49:49,670
then your neighbor who didn't have that
would have all the kids it feels like

9702
02:49:49,670 --> 02:49:49,680
would have all the kids it feels like
 

9703
02:49:49,680 --> 02:49:51,410
would have all the kids it feels like
there could be some deep truth there

9704
02:49:51,410 --> 02:49:51,420
there could be some deep truth there
 

9705
02:49:51,420 --> 02:49:54,410
there could be some deep truth there
that we're not understanding

9706
02:49:54,410 --> 02:49:54,420
that we're not understanding
 

9707
02:49:54,420 --> 02:49:56,270
that we're not understanding
um what about you yourself as one

9708
02:49:56,270 --> 02:49:56,280
um what about you yourself as one
 

9709
02:49:56,280 --> 02:49:57,950
um what about you yourself as one
biological system are you afraid of

9710
02:49:57,950 --> 02:49:57,960
biological system are you afraid of
 

9711
02:49:57,960 --> 02:49:59,090
biological system are you afraid of
death

9712
02:49:59,090 --> 02:49:59,100
death
 

9713
02:49:59,100 --> 02:50:03,170
death
to be honest I'm more concerned with uh

9714
02:50:03,170 --> 02:50:03,180
to be honest I'm more concerned with uh
 

9715
02:50:03,180 --> 02:50:05,030
to be honest I'm more concerned with uh
especially now getting older and having

9716
02:50:05,030 --> 02:50:05,040
especially now getting older and having
 

9717
02:50:05,040 --> 02:50:08,030
especially now getting older and having
helped a couple of people pass I think

9718
02:50:08,030 --> 02:50:08,040
helped a couple of people pass I think
 

9719
02:50:08,040 --> 02:50:11,830
helped a couple of people pass I think
about what's a um

9720
02:50:11,830 --> 02:50:11,840

 

9721
02:50:11,840 --> 02:50:14,450

what's a good way to go basically like

9722
02:50:14,450 --> 02:50:14,460
what's a good way to go basically like
 

9723
02:50:14,460 --> 02:50:16,370
what's a good way to go basically like
nowadays I don't know what that is I you

9724
02:50:16,370 --> 02:50:16,380
nowadays I don't know what that is I you
 

9725
02:50:16,380 --> 02:50:18,410
nowadays I don't know what that is I you
know sitting in a you know a facility

9726
02:50:18,410 --> 02:50:18,420
know sitting in a you know a facility
 

9727
02:50:18,420 --> 02:50:21,230
know sitting in a you know a facility
that sort of tries to uh stretch you out

9728
02:50:21,230 --> 02:50:21,240
that sort of tries to uh stretch you out
 

9729
02:50:21,240 --> 02:50:23,510
that sort of tries to uh stretch you out
as as long as you can that doesn't seem

9730
02:50:23,510 --> 02:50:23,520
as as long as you can that doesn't seem
 

9731
02:50:23,520 --> 02:50:25,309
as as long as you can that doesn't seem
that doesn't seem good and there's not a

9732
02:50:25,309 --> 02:50:25,319
that doesn't seem good and there's not a
 

9733
02:50:25,319 --> 02:50:27,290
that doesn't seem good and there's not a
lot of opportunities to sort of

9734
02:50:27,290 --> 02:50:27,300
lot of opportunities to sort of
 

9735
02:50:27,300 --> 02:50:28,849
lot of opportunities to sort of
um I don't know sacrifice yourself for

9736
02:50:28,849 --> 02:50:28,859
um I don't know sacrifice yourself for
 

9737
02:50:28,859 --> 02:50:30,230
um I don't know sacrifice yourself for
something useful right there's not

9738
02:50:30,230 --> 02:50:30,240
something useful right there's not
 

9739
02:50:30,240 --> 02:50:31,910
something useful right there's not
terribly many opportunities for that in

9740
02:50:31,910 --> 02:50:31,920
terribly many opportunities for that in
 

9741
02:50:31,920 --> 02:50:33,830
terribly many opportunities for that in
modern society so I don't know that's

9742
02:50:33,830 --> 02:50:33,840
modern society so I don't know that's
 

9743
02:50:33,840 --> 02:50:35,750
modern society so I don't know that's
that's that's more of I'm not I'm not

9744
02:50:35,750 --> 02:50:35,760
that's that's more of I'm not I'm not
 

9745
02:50:35,760 --> 02:50:37,490
that's that's more of I'm not I'm not
particularly worried about uh death

9746
02:50:37,490 --> 02:50:37,500
particularly worried about uh death
 

9747
02:50:37,500 --> 02:50:41,270
particularly worried about uh death
itself but uh I've I've seen it happen

9748
02:50:41,270 --> 02:50:41,280
itself but uh I've I've seen it happen
 

9749
02:50:41,280 --> 02:50:45,590
itself but uh I've I've seen it happen
uh and and it's not it's not pretty and

9750
02:50:45,590 --> 02:50:45,600
uh and and it's not it's not pretty and
 

9751
02:50:45,600 --> 02:50:47,330
uh and and it's not it's not pretty and
I don't know what what a better what a

9752
02:50:47,330 --> 02:50:47,340
I don't know what what a better what a
 

9753
02:50:47,340 --> 02:50:49,309
I don't know what what a better what a
better alternative is so the existential

9754
02:50:49,309 --> 02:50:49,319
better alternative is so the existential
 

9755
02:50:49,319 --> 02:50:52,190
better alternative is so the existential
aspect of it does not

9756
02:50:52,190 --> 02:50:52,200
aspect of it does not
 

9757
02:50:52,200 --> 02:50:55,429
aspect of it does not
worry you deeply the fact that this ride

9758
02:50:55,429 --> 02:50:55,439
worry you deeply the fact that this ride
 

9759
02:50:55,439 --> 02:50:56,690
worry you deeply the fact that this ride
ends

9760
02:50:56,690 --> 02:50:56,700
ends
 

9761
02:50:56,700 --> 02:50:59,450
ends
no it began I mean the ride began right

9762
02:50:59,450 --> 02:50:59,460
no it began I mean the ride began right
 

9763
02:50:59,460 --> 02:51:00,650
no it began I mean the ride began right
so there was I don't know how many

9764
02:51:00,650 --> 02:51:00,660
so there was I don't know how many
 

9765
02:51:00,660 --> 02:51:02,990
so there was I don't know how many
billions of years before that I wasn't

9766
02:51:02,990 --> 02:51:03,000
billions of years before that I wasn't
 

9767
02:51:03,000 --> 02:51:05,330
billions of years before that I wasn't
around so that's okay but isn't the

9768
02:51:05,330 --> 02:51:05,340
around so that's okay but isn't the
 

9769
02:51:05,340 --> 02:51:07,370
around so that's okay but isn't the
experience of life

9770
02:51:07,370 --> 02:51:07,380
experience of life
 

9771
02:51:07,380 --> 02:51:09,170
experience of life
it's almost like feels like you're

9772
02:51:09,170 --> 02:51:09,180
it's almost like feels like you're
 

9773
02:51:09,180 --> 02:51:11,690
it's almost like feels like you're
Immortal because the way you make plans

9774
02:51:11,690 --> 02:51:11,700
Immortal because the way you make plans
 

9775
02:51:11,700 --> 02:51:14,150
Immortal because the way you make plans
the way you think about the future I

9776
02:51:14,150 --> 02:51:14,160
the way you think about the future I
 

9777
02:51:14,160 --> 02:51:16,250
the way you think about the future I
mean if if you re if you look at your

9778
02:51:16,250 --> 02:51:16,260
mean if if you re if you look at your
 

9779
02:51:16,260 --> 02:51:19,429
mean if if you re if you look at your
own personal Rich experience

9780
02:51:19,429 --> 02:51:19,439
own personal Rich experience
 

9781
02:51:19,439 --> 02:51:22,130
own personal Rich experience
yes you can understand okay eventually I

9782
02:51:22,130 --> 02:51:22,140
yes you can understand okay eventually I
 

9783
02:51:22,140 --> 02:51:24,110
yes you can understand okay eventually I
died there's people I love that have

9784
02:51:24,110 --> 02:51:24,120
died there's people I love that have
 

9785
02:51:24,120 --> 02:51:27,530
died there's people I love that have
died so surely I will die and it hurts

9786
02:51:27,530 --> 02:51:27,540
died so surely I will die and it hurts
 

9787
02:51:27,540 --> 02:51:30,650
died so surely I will die and it hurts
and so on but like it sure doesn't it's

seen that that happen at lunch with a
with a well-known philosopher and uh he

9808
02:51:49,429 --> 02:51:49,439
with a well-known philosopher and uh he
 

9809
02:51:49,439 --> 02:51:50,690
with a well-known philosopher and uh he

talked about all kinds of embodied Minds
 

9843
02:52:22,260 --> 02:52:23,870
talked about all kinds of embodied Minds
what do you think is the meaning of it

9844
02:52:23,870 --> 02:52:23,880
what do you think is the meaning of it
 

9845
02:52:23,880 --> 02:52:24,710
what do you think is the meaning of it
all

9846
02:52:24,710 --> 02:52:24,720
all
 

9847
02:52:24,720 --> 02:52:26,330
all
what's the meaning

9848
02:52:26,330 --> 02:52:26,340
what's the meaning
 

9849
02:52:26,340 --> 02:52:28,429
what's the meaning
of all the biological eyes I've been

9850
02:52:28,429 --> 02:52:28,439
of all the biological eyes I've been
 

9851
02:52:28,439 --> 02:52:31,309
of all the biological eyes I've been
talking about here on Earth why are we

9852
02:52:31,309 --> 02:52:31,319
talking about here on Earth why are we
 

9853
02:52:31,319 --> 02:52:33,170
talking about here on Earth why are we
here

9854
02:52:33,170 --> 02:52:33,180
here
 

9855
02:52:33,180 --> 02:52:35,230
here
I don't know that that's a that that's a

9856
02:52:35,230 --> 02:52:35,240
I don't know that that's a that that's a
 

9857
02:52:35,240 --> 02:52:38,210
I don't know that that's a that that's a
well-posed question other than the

9858
02:52:38,210 --> 02:52:38,220
well-posed question other than the
 

9859
02:52:38,220 --> 02:52:41,210
well-posed question other than the
existential question you posed before is

9860
02:52:41,210 --> 02:52:41,220
existential question you posed before is
 

9861
02:52:41,220 --> 02:52:42,710
existential question you posed before is
that question hanging out with the

9862
02:52:42,710 --> 02:52:42,720
that question hanging out with the
 

9863
02:52:42,720 --> 02:52:44,570
that question hanging out with the
question of what is consciousness and

9864
02:52:44,570 --> 02:52:44,580
question of what is consciousness and
 

9865
02:52:44,580 --> 02:52:48,769
question of what is consciousness and
their uh Edward Retreat somewhere not

9866
02:52:48,769 --> 02:52:48,779
their uh Edward Retreat somewhere not
 

9867
02:52:48,779 --> 02:52:51,950
their uh Edward Retreat somewhere not
sure because sipping pina coladas and

9868
02:52:51,950 --> 02:52:51,960
sure because sipping pina coladas and
 

9869
02:52:51,960 --> 02:52:54,469
sure because sipping pina coladas and
because they're Ambiguously defined

9870
02:52:54,469 --> 02:52:54,479
because they're Ambiguously defined
 

9871
02:52:54,479 --> 02:52:57,469
because they're Ambiguously defined
maybe I'm I'm not sure that any of these

9872
02:52:57,469 --> 02:52:57,479
maybe I'm I'm not sure that any of these
 

9873
02:52:57,479 --> 02:53:00,590
maybe I'm I'm not sure that any of these
things really ride on the the

9874
02:53:00,590 --> 02:53:00,600
things really ride on the the
 

9875
02:53:00,600 --> 02:53:01,730
things really ride on the the
correctness of our scientific

9876
02:53:01,730 --> 02:53:01,740
correctness of our scientific
 

9877
02:53:01,740 --> 02:53:03,170
correctness of our scientific
understanding but I mean just just for

9878
02:53:03,170 --> 02:53:03,180
understanding but I mean just just for
 

9879
02:53:03,180 --> 02:53:04,849
understanding but I mean just just for
an example right

9880
02:53:04,849 --> 02:53:04,859
an example right
 

9881
02:53:04,859 --> 02:53:06,830
an example right
um I've I've always found I've always

9882
02:53:06,830 --> 02:53:06,840
um I've I've always found I've always
 

9883
02:53:06,840 --> 02:53:11,750
um I've I've always found I've always
found it weird that uh people get really

9884
02:53:11,750 --> 02:53:11,760
found it weird that uh people get really
 

9885
02:53:11,760 --> 02:53:16,370
found it weird that uh people get really
worked up uh to find out realities about

9886
02:53:16,370 --> 02:53:16,380
worked up uh to find out realities about
 

9887
02:53:16,380 --> 02:53:18,950
worked up uh to find out realities about
their their bodies for for example right

9888
02:53:18,950 --> 02:53:18,960
their their bodies for for example right
 

9889
02:53:18,960 --> 02:53:22,130
their their bodies for for example right
you've seen them uh ex machina right and

9890
02:53:22,130 --> 02:53:22,140
you've seen them uh ex machina right and
 

9891
02:53:22,140 --> 02:53:23,330
you've seen them uh ex machina right and
so so there's this great scene where

9892
02:53:23,330 --> 02:53:23,340
so so there's this great scene where
 

9893
02:53:23,340 --> 02:53:24,590
so so there's this great scene where
he's cutting his hand to find out he's

9894
02:53:24,590 --> 02:53:24,600
he's cutting his hand to find out he's
 

9895
02:53:24,600 --> 02:53:26,510
he's cutting his hand to find out he's
you know he's full of [\h__\h] now to me

9896
02:53:26,510 --> 02:53:26,520
you know he's full of [\h__\h] now to me
 

9897
02:53:26,520 --> 02:53:30,170
you know he's full of [\h__\h] now to me
right if if I open up and I find out and

9898
02:53:30,170 --> 02:53:30,180
right if if I open up and I find out and
 

9899
02:53:30,180 --> 02:53:32,269
right if if I open up and I find out and
I find a bunch of cogs my conclusion is

9900
02:53:32,269 --> 02:53:32,279
I find a bunch of cogs my conclusion is
 

9901
02:53:32,279 --> 02:53:34,130
I find a bunch of cogs my conclusion is
not oh crap I must not have true

9902
02:53:34,130 --> 02:53:34,140
not oh crap I must not have true
 

9903
02:53:34,140 --> 02:53:36,469
not oh crap I must not have true
cognition that sucks my conclusion is

9904
02:53:36,469 --> 02:53:36,479
cognition that sucks my conclusion is
 

9905
02:53:36,479 --> 02:53:38,630
cognition that sucks my conclusion is
wow cogs can have true cognition great

9906
02:53:38,630 --> 02:53:38,640
wow cogs can have true cognition great
 

9907
02:53:38,640 --> 02:53:42,590
wow cogs can have true cognition great
so right so so it seems to me I guess I

9908
02:53:42,590 --> 02:53:42,600
so right so so it seems to me I guess I
 

9909
02:53:42,600 --> 02:53:43,790
so right so so it seems to me I guess I
guess I'm with Descartes on this one

9910
02:53:43,790 --> 02:53:43,800
guess I'm with Descartes on this one
 

9911
02:53:43,800 --> 02:53:46,250
guess I'm with Descartes on this one
then whatever whatever the truth uh ends

9912
02:53:46,250 --> 02:53:46,260
then whatever whatever the truth uh ends
 

9913
02:53:46,260 --> 02:53:48,650
then whatever whatever the truth uh ends
up being of of how is what is

9914
02:53:48,650 --> 02:53:48,660
up being of of how is what is
 

9915
02:53:48,660 --> 02:53:49,969
up being of of how is what is
consciousness how it can be conscious

9916
02:53:49,969 --> 02:53:49,979
consciousness how it can be conscious
 

9917
02:53:49,979 --> 02:53:52,790
consciousness how it can be conscious
none of that is going to alter my

9918
02:53:52,790 --> 02:53:52,800
none of that is going to alter my
 

9919
02:53:52,800 --> 02:53:54,170
none of that is going to alter my
primary experience which is this is what

9920
02:53:54,170 --> 02:53:54,180
primary experience which is this is what
 

9921
02:53:54,180 --> 02:53:56,210
primary experience which is this is what
it is and if and if a bunch of molecular

9922
02:53:56,210 --> 02:53:56,220
it is and if and if a bunch of molecular
 

9923
02:53:56,220 --> 02:53:58,610
it is and if and if a bunch of molecular
networks can do it fantastic if it turns

9924
02:53:58,610 --> 02:53:58,620
networks can do it fantastic if it turns
 

9925
02:53:58,620 --> 02:54:00,490
networks can do it fantastic if it turns
out that um there's a there's a

9926
02:54:00,490 --> 02:54:00,500
out that um there's a there's a
 

9927
02:54:00,500 --> 02:54:03,469
out that um there's a there's a
non-corporeal you know Soul uh great we

9928
02:54:03,469 --> 02:54:03,479
non-corporeal you know Soul uh great we
 

9929
02:54:03,479 --> 02:54:04,670
non-corporeal you know Soul uh great we
could you know we'll study that whatever

9930
02:54:04,670 --> 02:54:04,680
could you know we'll study that whatever
 

9931
02:54:04,680 --> 02:54:07,010
could you know we'll study that whatever
but but the fundamental

but but the fundamental
 

9933
02:54:07,020 --> 02:54:09,410
but but the fundamental
um existential aspect of it is you know

9934
02:54:09,410 --> 02:54:09,420
um existential aspect of it is you know

02:54:09,420 --> 02:54:11,150
um existential aspect of it is you know
if somebody if somebody told me uh today

9936
02:54:11,150 --> 02:54:11,160
if somebody if somebody told me uh today

yesterday and all your memories are you

9940
02:54:14,570 --> 02:54:14,580
yesterday and all your memories are you
 

9941
02:54:14,580 --> 02:54:16,190
yesterday and all your memories are you
know sort of uh fake you know kind of

9942
02:54:16,190 --> 02:54:16,200
know sort of uh fake you know kind of
 

9943
02:54:16,200 --> 02:54:18,650
know sort of uh fake you know kind of
like um like like boltzmann brains right

9944
02:54:18,650 --> 02:54:18,660
like um like like boltzmann brains right
 

9945
02:54:18,660 --> 02:54:20,570
like um like like boltzmann brains right
and the human you know human skepticism

9946
02:54:20,570 --> 02:54:20,580
and the human you know human skepticism
 

9947
02:54:20,580 --> 02:54:23,690
and the human you know human skepticism
and all that uh yeah okay well so so but

9948
02:54:23,690 --> 02:54:23,700
and all that uh yeah okay well so so but
 

9949
02:54:23,700 --> 02:54:27,710
and all that uh yeah okay well so so but
but here I am now so so let's experience

9950
02:54:27,710 --> 02:54:27,720
but here I am now so so let's experience
 

9951
02:54:27,720 --> 02:54:31,370
but here I am now so so let's experience
is Primal so it like that's the that's

9952
02:54:31,370 --> 02:54:31,380
is Primal so it like that's the that's
 

9953
02:54:31,380 --> 02:54:33,530
is Primal so it like that's the that's
the thing that matters so the the back

9954
02:54:33,530 --> 02:54:33,540
the thing that matters so the the back
 

9955
02:54:33,540 --> 02:54:35,630
the thing that matters so the the back
story doesn't matter the explanation I

9956
02:54:35,630 --> 02:54:35,640
story doesn't matter the explanation I
 

9957
02:54:35,640 --> 02:54:37,010
story doesn't matter the explanation I
think so from a first person per second

9958
02:54:37,010 --> 02:54:37,020
think so from a first person per second
 

9959
02:54:37,020 --> 02:54:38,210
think so from a first person per second
now from a third person like

9960
02:54:38,210 --> 02:54:38,220
now from a third person like
 

9961
02:54:38,220 --> 02:54:39,530
now from a third person like
scientifically it's all very interesting

9962
02:54:39,530 --> 02:54:39,540
scientifically it's all very interesting
 

9963
02:54:39,540 --> 02:54:41,510
scientifically it's all very interesting
from a third person perspective I could

9964
02:54:41,510 --> 02:54:41,520
from a third person perspective I could
 

9965
02:54:41,520 --> 02:54:43,730
from a third person perspective I could
say wow that's that's amazing that that

9966
02:54:43,730 --> 02:54:43,740
say wow that's that's amazing that that
 

9967
02:54:43,740 --> 02:54:45,230
say wow that's that's amazing that that
this happens and how does it happen or

9968
02:54:45,230 --> 02:54:45,240
this happens and how does it happen or
 

9969
02:54:45,240 --> 02:54:46,550
this happens and how does it happen or
whatever but from a first person

9970
02:54:46,550 --> 02:54:46,560
whatever but from a first person
 

9971
02:54:46,560 --> 02:54:49,309
whatever but from a first person
perspective I could care less like I

9972
02:54:49,309 --> 02:54:49,319
perspective I could care less like I
 

9973
02:54:49,319 --> 02:54:50,990
perspective I could care less like I
just it's just what I've what I learned

9974
02:54:50,990 --> 02:54:51,000
just it's just what I've what I learned
 

9975
02:54:51,000 --> 02:54:53,150
just it's just what I've what I learned
from any of these scientific facts is

9976
02:54:53,150 --> 02:54:53,160
from any of these scientific facts is
 

9977
02:54:53,160 --> 02:54:55,550
from any of these scientific facts is
okay well I guess then that's that then

9978
02:54:55,550 --> 02:54:55,560
okay well I guess then that's that then
 

9979
02:54:55,560 --> 02:54:57,769
okay well I guess then that's that then
I guess that's what is sufficient to to

9980
02:54:57,769 --> 02:54:57,779
I guess that's what is sufficient to to
 

9981
02:54:57,779 --> 02:54:59,690
I guess that's what is sufficient to to
give me my uh you know amazing first

9982
02:54:59,690 --> 02:54:59,700
give me my uh you know amazing first
 

9983
02:54:59,700 --> 02:55:01,550
give me my uh you know amazing first
person perspective well I think if you

9984
02:55:01,550 --> 02:55:01,560
person perspective well I think if you
 

9985
02:55:01,560 --> 02:55:03,969
person perspective well I think if you
dig deeper and deeper and get a

9986
02:55:03,969 --> 02:55:03,979
dig deeper and deeper and get a
 

9987
02:55:03,979 --> 02:55:07,910
dig deeper and deeper and get a
get surprising answers to why the hell

9988
02:55:07,910 --> 02:55:07,920
get surprising answers to why the hell
 

9989
02:55:07,920 --> 02:55:09,230
get surprising answers to why the hell
we're here

9990
02:55:09,230 --> 02:55:09,240
we're here
 

9991
02:55:09,240 --> 02:55:12,469
we're here
it might give you some guidance on how

9992
02:55:12,469 --> 02:55:12,479
it might give you some guidance on how
 

9993
02:55:12,479 --> 02:55:14,450
it might give you some guidance on how
to live

9994
02:55:14,450 --> 02:55:14,460
to live
 

9995
02:55:14,460 --> 02:55:17,150
to live
maybe maybe I don't know um that would

9996
02:55:17,150 --> 02:55:17,160
maybe maybe I don't know um that would
 

9997
02:55:17,160 --> 02:55:20,090
maybe maybe I don't know um that would
be nice on the one hand you might be

9998
02:55:20,090 --> 02:55:20,100
be nice on the one hand you might be
 

9999
02:55:20,100 --> 02:55:22,309
be nice on the one hand you might be
right because on the one hand if I don't

10000
02:55:22,309 --> 02:55:22,319
right because on the one hand if I don't
 

10001
02:55:22,319 --> 02:55:23,630
right because on the one hand if I don't
know what else could possibly give you

10002
02:55:23,630 --> 02:55:23,640
know what else could possibly give you
 

10003
02:55:23,640 --> 02:55:25,130
know what else could possibly give you
that guidance right so so you would

10004
02:55:25,130 --> 02:55:25,140
that guidance right so so you would
 

10005
02:55:25,140 --> 02:55:26,269
that guidance right so so you would
think that it would have to be that or

10006
02:55:26,269 --> 02:55:26,279
think that it would have to be that or
 

10007
02:55:26,279 --> 02:55:27,530
think that it would have to be that or
it would it would have to be science

10008
02:55:27,530 --> 02:55:27,540
it would it would have to be science
 

10009
02:55:27,540 --> 02:55:29,809
it would it would have to be science
because there isn't anything else so so

10010
02:55:29,809 --> 02:55:29,819
because there isn't anything else so so
 

10011
02:55:29,819 --> 02:55:32,349
because there isn't anything else so so
that's so maybe on the other hand

10012
02:55:32,349 --> 02:55:32,359
that's so maybe on the other hand
 

10013
02:55:32,359 --> 02:55:36,050
that's so maybe on the other hand
I am really not sure how you go from any

before I I'm not you know impressed by

02:55:48,830 --> 02:55:48,840
before I I'm not you know impressed by
 

10029

well there's also good because you said

10036
02:55:59,450 --> 02:55:59,460
well there's also good because you said
 

10037
02:55:59,460 --> 02:56:02,530
well there's also good because you said
there's science and there's nothing else

10038
02:56:02,530 --> 02:56:02,540
there's science and there's nothing else
 

10039
02:56:02,540 --> 02:56:06,349
there's science and there's nothing else
there it's it's really tricky

10040
02:56:06,349 --> 02:56:06,359
there it's it's really tricky
 

10041
02:56:06,359 --> 02:56:08,630
there it's it's really tricky
to know

10042
02:56:08,630 --> 02:56:08,640
to know
 

10043
02:56:08,640 --> 02:56:10,790
to know
how to intellectually deal with the

10044
02:56:10,790 --> 02:56:10,800
how to intellectually deal with the
 

10045
02:56:10,800 --> 02:56:12,170
how to intellectually deal with the
thing that science doesn't currently

10046
02:56:12,170 --> 02:56:12,180
thing that science doesn't currently
 

10047
02:56:12,180 --> 02:56:13,969
thing that science doesn't currently
understand

10048
02:56:13,969 --> 02:56:13,979
understand
 

10049
02:56:13,979 --> 02:56:16,610
understand
right so like

10050
02:56:16,610 --> 02:56:16,620
right so like
 

10051
02:56:16,620 --> 02:56:18,910
right so like
the thing is if you believe that science

10052
02:56:18,910 --> 02:56:18,920
the thing is if you believe that science
 

10053
02:56:18,920 --> 02:56:22,550
the thing is if you believe that science
solves everything

10054
02:56:22,550 --> 02:56:22,560
solves everything
 

10055
02:56:22,560 --> 02:56:26,929
solves everything
you can too easily in your mind think

10056
02:56:26,929 --> 02:56:26,939
you can too easily in your mind think
 

10057
02:56:26,939 --> 02:56:30,050
you can too easily in your mind think
our current understanding like we've

10058
02:56:30,050 --> 02:56:30,060
our current understanding like we've
 

10059
02:56:30,060 --> 02:56:32,389
our current understanding like we've
solved everything right right right like

10060
02:56:32,389 --> 02:56:32,399
solved everything right right right like
 

10061
02:56:32,399 --> 02:56:35,210
solved everything right right right like
it jumps really quickly to not science

10062
02:56:35,210 --> 02:56:35,220
it jumps really quickly to not science
 

10063
02:56:35,220 --> 02:56:39,230
it jumps really quickly to not science
as a mechanism as a as a process

10064
02:56:39,230 --> 02:56:39,240
as a mechanism as a as a process
 

10065
02:56:39,240 --> 02:56:42,410
as a mechanism as a as a process
but more like the size of today like you

10066
02:56:42,410 --> 02:56:42,420
but more like the size of today like you
 

10067
02:56:42,420 --> 02:56:43,790
but more like the size of today like you
could just look at human history and

10068
02:56:43,790 --> 02:56:43,800
could just look at human history and
 

10069
02:56:43,800 --> 02:56:46,730
could just look at human history and
throughout human history just physicists

10070
02:56:46,730 --> 02:56:46,740
throughout human history just physicists
 

10071
02:56:46,740 --> 02:56:49,250
throughout human history just physicists
and everybody would claim we've solved

10072
02:56:49,250 --> 02:56:49,260
and everybody would claim we've solved
 

10073
02:56:49,260 --> 02:56:51,769
and everybody would claim we've solved
everything sure sure like there's a few

10074
02:56:51,769 --> 02:56:51,779
everything sure sure like there's a few
 

10075
02:56:51,779 --> 02:56:53,750
everything sure sure like there's a few
small things to figure out and just we

10076
02:56:53,750 --> 02:56:53,760
small things to figure out and just we
 

10077
02:56:53,760 --> 02:56:56,389
small things to figure out and just we
basically solved everything uh where in

10078
02:56:56,389 --> 02:56:56,399
basically solved everything uh where in
 

10079
02:56:56,399 --> 02:56:58,730
basically solved everything uh where in
reality I think asking like what is the

10080
02:56:58,730 --> 02:56:58,740
reality I think asking like what is the
 

10081
02:56:58,740 --> 02:56:59,990
reality I think asking like what is the
meaning of life

10082
02:56:59,990 --> 02:57:00,000
meaning of life
 

10083
02:57:00,000 --> 02:57:02,690
meaning of life
is uh resetting the palette

10084
02:57:02,690 --> 02:57:02,700
is uh resetting the palette
 

10085
02:57:02,700 --> 02:57:05,030
is uh resetting the palette
yeah of like

10086
02:57:05,030 --> 02:57:05,040
yeah of like
 

10087
02:57:05,040 --> 02:57:08,330
yeah of like
we might be tiny and confused and don't

10088
02:57:08,330 --> 02:57:08,340
we might be tiny and confused and don't
 

10089
02:57:08,340 --> 02:57:10,370
we might be tiny and confused and don't
have anything figured out it's almost

10090
02:57:10,370 --> 02:57:10,380
have anything figured out it's almost
 

10091
02:57:10,380 --> 02:57:12,469
have anything figured out it's almost
going to be hilarious a few centuries

10092
02:57:12,469 --> 02:57:12,479
going to be hilarious a few centuries
 

10093
02:57:12,479 --> 02:57:15,349
going to be hilarious a few centuries
from now when they look back how dumb we

10094
02:57:15,349 --> 02:57:15,359
from now when they look back how dumb we
 

10095
02:57:15,359 --> 02:57:20,030
from now when they look back how dumb we
were yeah 100 agree so so when I say uh

10096
02:57:20,030 --> 02:57:20,040
were yeah 100 agree so so when I say uh
 

10097
02:57:20,040 --> 02:57:22,370
were yeah 100 agree so so when I say uh
science and nothing else I certainly

10098
02:57:22,370 --> 02:57:22,380
science and nothing else I certainly
 

10099
02:57:22,380 --> 02:57:24,370
science and nothing else I certainly
don't mean the science of today because

10100
02:57:24,370 --> 02:57:24,380
don't mean the science of today because
 

10101
02:57:24,380 --> 02:57:28,010
don't mean the science of today because
I think overall I think we are we know

10102
02:57:28,010 --> 02:57:28,020
I think overall I think we are we know
 

10103
02:57:28,020 --> 02:57:29,750
I think overall I think we are we know
very little I think most of the things

10104
02:57:29,750 --> 02:57:29,760
very little I think most of the things
 

10105
02:57:29,760 --> 02:57:32,090
very little I think most of the things
that we're sure of now are going to be

10106
02:57:32,090 --> 02:57:32,100
that we're sure of now are going to be
 

10107
02:57:32,100 --> 02:57:33,650
that we're sure of now are going to be
as you said are going to look hilarious

10108
02:57:33,650 --> 02:57:33,660
as you said are going to look hilarious
 

10109
02:57:33,660 --> 02:57:34,849
as you said are going to look hilarious
down the line

10110
02:57:34,849 --> 02:57:34,859
down the line
 

10111
02:57:34,859 --> 02:57:36,170
down the line
um so I think we're just at the

10112
02:57:36,170 --> 02:57:36,180
um so I think we're just at the
 

10113
02:57:36,180 --> 02:57:37,610
um so I think we're just at the
beginning of a lot of really important

10114
02:57:37,610 --> 02:57:37,620
beginning of a lot of really important
 

10115
02:57:37,620 --> 02:57:38,389
beginning of a lot of really important
things

10116
02:57:38,389 --> 02:57:38,399
things
 

10117
02:57:38,399 --> 02:57:41,330
things
when I say nothing but science I also

10118
02:57:41,330 --> 02:57:41,340
when I say nothing but science I also
 

10119
02:57:41,340 --> 02:57:44,750
when I say nothing but science I also
include the kind of first person what I

10120
02:57:44,750 --> 02:57:44,760
include the kind of first person what I
 

10121
02:57:44,760 --> 02:57:46,490
include the kind of first person what I
call science that you do so the

10122
02:57:46,490 --> 02:57:46,500
call science that you do so the
 

10123
02:57:46,500 --> 02:57:48,650
call science that you do so the
interesting thing about um I think about

10124
02:57:48,650 --> 02:57:48,660
interesting thing about um I think about
 

10125
02:57:48,660 --> 02:57:50,330
interesting thing about um I think about
Consciousness and studying Consciousness

10126
02:57:50,330 --> 02:57:50,340
Consciousness and studying Consciousness
 

10127
02:57:50,340 --> 02:57:51,469
Consciousness and studying Consciousness
and things like that in the first person

10128
02:57:51,469 --> 02:57:51,479
and things like that in the first person
 

10129
02:57:51,479 --> 02:57:54,050
and things like that in the first person
is unlike doing science in the third

10130
02:57:54,050 --> 02:57:54,060
is unlike doing science in the third
 

10131
02:57:54,060 --> 02:57:56,809
is unlike doing science in the third
person where you as the scientists are

10132
02:57:56,809 --> 02:57:56,819
person where you as the scientists are
 

10133
02:57:56,819 --> 02:57:58,849
person where you as the scientists are
minimally Changed by it maybe not at all

10134
02:57:58,849 --> 02:57:58,859
minimally Changed by it maybe not at all
 

10135
02:57:58,859 --> 02:58:00,410
minimally Changed by it maybe not at all
so when I do an experiment I'm still me

10136
02:58:00,410 --> 02:58:00,420
so when I do an experiment I'm still me
 

10137
02:58:00,420 --> 02:58:01,670
so when I do an experiment I'm still me
there's the experiment whatever I've

10138
02:58:01,670 --> 02:58:01,680
there's the experiment whatever I've
 

10139
02:58:01,680 --> 02:58:02,870
there's the experiment whatever I've
done I've learned something so that's a

10140
02:58:02,870 --> 02:58:02,880
done I've learned something so that's a
 

10141
02:58:02,880 --> 02:58:04,429
done I've learned something so that's a
small change but but overall that's it

10142
02:58:04,429 --> 02:58:04,439
small change but but overall that's it
 

10143
02:58:04,439 --> 02:58:07,809
small change but but overall that's it
in order to really study Consciousness

10144
02:58:07,809 --> 02:58:07,819
in order to really study Consciousness
 

10145
02:58:07,819 --> 02:58:10,429
in order to really study Consciousness
you will you are part of the experiment

10146
02:58:10,429 --> 02:58:10,439
you will you are part of the experiment
 

10147
02:58:10,439 --> 02:58:12,230
you will you are part of the experiment
you will be altered by that experiment

10148
02:58:12,230 --> 02:58:12,240
you will be altered by that experiment
 

10149
02:58:12,240 --> 02:58:13,550
you will be altered by that experiment
right whatever whatever it is that

10150
02:58:13,550 --> 02:58:13,560
right whatever whatever it is that
 

10151
02:58:13,560 --> 02:58:14,809
right whatever whatever it is that
you're doing whether it's you know some

10152
02:58:14,809 --> 02:58:14,819
you're doing whether it's you know some
 

10153
02:58:14,819 --> 02:58:16,730
you're doing whether it's you know some
sort of contemplative practice or

10154
02:58:16,730 --> 02:58:16,740
sort of contemplative practice or
 

10155
02:58:16,740 --> 02:58:19,150
sort of contemplative practice or
uh or or some sort of uh you know

10156
02:58:19,150 --> 02:58:19,160
uh or or some sort of uh you know
 

10157
02:58:19,160 --> 02:58:21,769
uh or or some sort of uh you know
psychoactive but you know whatever uh

10158
02:58:21,769 --> 02:58:21,779
psychoactive but you know whatever uh
 

10159
02:58:21,779 --> 02:58:23,570
psychoactive but you know whatever uh
you are now you are now your own

10160
02:58:23,570 --> 02:58:23,580
you are now you are now your own
 

10161
02:58:23,580 --> 02:58:25,429
you are now you are now your own
experiment and you are right and so so I

10162
02:58:25,429 --> 02:58:25,439
experiment and you are right and so so I
 

10163
02:58:25,439 --> 02:58:26,990
experiment and you are right and so so I
can say I fold that in I think that's

10164
02:58:26,990 --> 02:58:27,000
can say I fold that in I think that's
 

10165
02:58:27,000 --> 02:58:29,330
can say I fold that in I think that's
that's part of it I think that exploring

10166
02:58:29,330 --> 02:58:29,340
that's part of it I think that exploring
 

10167
02:58:29,340 --> 02:58:30,290
that's part of it I think that exploring
um our own mind and our own

10168
02:58:30,290 --> 02:58:30,300
um our own mind and our own
 

10169
02:58:30,300 --> 02:58:31,790
um our own mind and our own
Consciousness is very important I think

10170
02:58:31,790 --> 02:58:31,800
Consciousness is very important I think
 

10171
02:58:31,800 --> 02:58:34,429
Consciousness is very important I think
much of it is not captured by what

10172
02:58:34,429 --> 02:58:34,439
much of it is not captured by what
 

10173
02:58:34,439 --> 02:58:36,349
much of it is not captured by what
currently is third person science for

10174
02:58:36,349 --> 02:58:36,359
currently is third person science for
 

10175
02:58:36,359 --> 02:58:38,690
currently is third person science for
sure but ultimately I include all of

10176
02:58:38,690 --> 02:58:38,700
sure but ultimately I include all of
 

10177
02:58:38,700 --> 02:58:40,150
sure but ultimately I include all of
that in science

10178
02:58:40,150 --> 02:58:40,160
that in science
 

10179
02:58:40,160 --> 02:58:43,610
that in science
with a capital s in terms of like a um

10180
02:58:43,610 --> 02:58:43,620
with a capital s in terms of like a um
 

10181
02:58:43,620 --> 02:58:46,429
with a capital s in terms of like a um
uh a rational investigation of both

10182
02:58:46,429 --> 02:58:46,439
uh a rational investigation of both
 

10183
02:58:46,439 --> 02:58:49,190
uh a rational investigation of both
first and third person aspects of our

10184
02:58:49,190 --> 02:58:49,200
first and third person aspects of our
 

10185
02:58:49,200 --> 02:58:49,929
first and third person aspects of our
world

10186
02:58:49,929 --> 02:58:49,939
world
 

10187
02:58:49,939 --> 02:58:53,570
world
we are our own experiment as beautifully

10188
02:58:53,570 --> 02:58:53,580
we are our own experiment as beautifully
 

10189
02:58:53,580 --> 02:58:57,710
we are our own experiment as beautifully
put and uh when when two systems get to

10190
02:58:57,710 --> 02:58:57,720
put and uh when when two systems get to
 

10191
02:58:57,720 --> 02:58:59,690
put and uh when when two systems get to
interact with each other that's the kind

10192
02:58:59,690 --> 02:58:59,700
interact with each other that's the kind
 

10193
02:58:59,700 --> 02:59:03,050
interact with each other that's the kind
of experiment so I'm deeply honored you

10194
02:59:03,050 --> 02:59:03,060
of experiment so I'm deeply honored you
 

10195
02:59:03,060 --> 02:59:04,790
of experiment so I'm deeply honored you
would uh do this experiment with me

10196
02:59:04,790 --> 02:59:04,800
would uh do this experiment with me
 

10197
02:59:04,800 --> 02:59:06,830
would uh do this experiment with me
