323
00:06:16,160 --> 00:06:19,029

uh in about 100 picoseconds and then the

324
00:06:19,029 --> 00:06:19,039
uh in about 100 picoseconds and then the
 

325
00:06:19,039 --> 00:06:21,350
uh in about 100 picoseconds and then the
photons scatter and absorb in your brain

00:06:23,590 --> 00:06:23,600
and then a few go in if you come back
 

329
00:06:23,600 --> 00:06:25,430
and then a few go in if you come back
out they a bunch go in that a fuel come

330
00:06:25,430 --> 00:06:25,440
out they a bunch go in that a fuel come
 

331
00:06:25,440 --> 00:06:26,710
out they a bunch go in that a fuel come
back out and we

332
00:06:26,710 --> 00:06:26,720
back out and we
 

333
00:06:26,720 --> 00:06:28,390
back out and we
sense those photons and then we do the

334
00:06:28,390 --> 00:06:28,400
sense those photons and then we do the
 

335
00:06:28,400 --> 00:06:30,230
sense those photons and then we do the
reconstruction for the activity

336
00:06:30,230 --> 00:06:30,240
reconstruction for the activity

difficult is it to make it as
 

345
00:06:37,199 --> 00:06:38,629
difficult is it to make it as

comfortable as it is
 

347
00:06:38,639 --> 00:06:40,710
comfortable as it is
because it's surprisingly comfortable i

348
00:06:40,710 --> 00:06:40,720
because it's surprisingly comfortable i
 

349
00:06:40,720 --> 00:06:44,230
because it's surprisingly comfortable i
would not think it would be comfortable

350
00:06:44,230 --> 00:06:44,240
would not think it would be comfortable

i would not think it would be
 

357
00:06:49,120 --> 00:06:51,749
i would not think it would be
comfortable but it is i agree in fact i

358
00:06:51,749 --> 00:06:51,759
comfortable but it is i agree in fact i
 

359
00:06:51,759 --> 00:06:52,870

want to take this home

360

want to take this home
 

361
00:06:52,880 --> 00:06:55,510
want to take this home
yeah yeah that's right so people are

362
00:06:55,510 --> 00:06:55,520
yeah yeah that's right so people are
 

363
00:06:55,520 --> 00:06:56,309
yeah yeah that's right so people are
accustomed

364
00:06:56,309 --> 00:06:56,319
accustomed
 

365
00:06:56,319 --> 00:07:00,550
accustomed
to being in big systems like fmri where

366
00:07:00,550 --> 00:07:00,560
to being in big systems like fmri where
 

367
00:07:00,560 --> 00:07:03,270
to being in big systems like fmri where
there's 120 decibel sounds and you're in

368
00:07:03,270 --> 00:07:03,280
there's 120 decibel sounds and you're in
 

369
00:07:03,280 --> 00:07:04,230
there's 120 decibel sounds and you're in
a claustrophobic

370
00:07:04,230 --> 00:07:04,240
a claustrophobic
 

371
00:07:04,240 --> 00:07:07,749
a claustrophobic
encasement or eeg which is just painful

372
00:07:07,749 --> 00:07:07,759
encasement or eeg which is just painful
 

373
00:07:07,759 --> 00:07:10,629
encasement or eeg which is just painful
or surgery and so yes i agree that this

374
00:07:10,629 --> 00:07:10,639
or surgery and so yes i agree that this
 

375
00:07:10,639 --> 00:07:11,270
or surgery and so yes i agree that this
is a

376
00:07:11,270 --> 00:07:11,280
is a
 

377
00:07:11,280 --> 00:07:12,950
is a
convenient option to be able to just put

378
00:07:12,950 --> 00:07:12,960
convenient option to be able to just put
 

379
00:07:12,960 --> 00:07:15,189
convenient option to be able to just put
on your head it measures your brain

380
00:07:15,189 --> 00:07:15,199
on your head it measures your brain
 

381
00:07:15,199 --> 00:07:17,350
on your head it measures your brain
activity in the contextual environment

382
00:07:17,350 --> 00:07:17,360
activity in the contextual environment
 

383
00:07:17,360 --> 00:07:18,710
activity in the contextual environment
you choose so if we

384
00:07:18,710 --> 00:07:18,720
you choose so if we
 

385
00:07:18,720 --> 00:07:20,309
you choose so if we
want to have it during the podcast if we

386
00:07:20,309 --> 00:07:20,319
want to have it during the podcast if we
 

387
00:07:20,319 --> 00:07:23,430
want to have it during the podcast if we
want to be at home in a business setting

388
00:07:23,430 --> 00:07:23,440
want to be at home in a business setting
 

389
00:07:23,440 --> 00:07:26,550
want to be at home in a business setting
so we it's freedom to be where to record

390
00:07:26,550 --> 00:07:26,560
so we it's freedom to be where to record
 

391
00:07:26,560 --> 00:07:28,070
so we it's freedom to be where to record
your brain activity in the setting that

392
00:07:28,070 --> 00:07:28,080
your brain activity in the setting that
 

393
00:07:28,080 --> 00:07:28,870
your brain activity in the setting that
you choose

394
00:07:28,870 --> 00:07:28,880
you choose
 

395
00:07:28,880 --> 00:07:30,230
you choose
yeah but sort of from an engineering

396
00:07:30,230 --> 00:07:30,240
yeah but sort of from an engineering
 

397
00:07:30,240 --> 00:07:32,309
yeah but sort of from an engineering
perspective are these uh

398
00:07:32,309 --> 00:07:32,319
perspective are these uh
 

399
00:07:32,319 --> 00:07:33,990
perspective are these uh
what is it there's a bunch of different

400
00:07:33,990 --> 00:07:34,000
what is it there's a bunch of different
 

401
00:07:34,000 --> 00:07:36,309
what is it there's a bunch of different
modular parts and they're kind of

402
00:07:36,309 --> 00:07:36,319
modular parts and they're kind of
 

403
00:07:36,319 --> 00:07:38,150
modular parts and they're kind of
there's like a rubber band thing where

404
00:07:38,150 --> 00:07:38,160
there's like a rubber band thing where
 

405
00:07:38,160 --> 00:07:40,710
there's like a rubber band thing where
they they mold to the shape of your head

406
00:07:40,710 --> 00:07:40,720
they they mold to the shape of your head
 

407
00:07:40,720 --> 00:07:43,589
they they mold to the shape of your head
that's right so we we built this this

408
00:07:43,589 --> 00:07:43,599
that's right so we we built this this
 

409
00:07:43,599 --> 00:07:45,350
that's right so we we built this this
version of the mechanical design

410
00:07:45,350 --> 00:07:45,360
version of the mechanical design
 

411
00:07:45,360 --> 00:07:49,589
version of the mechanical design
to accommodate most adult heads

412
00:07:49,589 --> 00:07:49,599
to accommodate most adult heads
 

413
00:07:49,599 --> 00:07:51,589
to accommodate most adult heads
but i have a giant head and if it's fine

414
00:07:51,589 --> 00:07:51,599
but i have a giant head and if it's fine
 

415
00:07:51,599 --> 00:07:53,749
but i have a giant head and if it's fine
it feels fits well actually

416
00:07:53,749 --> 00:07:53,759
it feels fits well actually
 

417
00:07:53,759 --> 00:07:58,230
it feels fits well actually
so i don't think i have an average head

418
00:07:58,230 --> 00:07:58,240
so i don't think i have an average head
 

419
00:07:58,240 --> 00:08:00,710
so i don't think i have an average head
okay maybe i feel i feel much better

420
00:08:00,710 --> 00:08:00,720
okay maybe i feel i feel much better
 

421
00:08:00,720 --> 00:08:02,390
okay maybe i feel i feel much better
about my head now maybe i'm

422
00:08:02,390 --> 00:08:02,400
about my head now maybe i'm
 

423
00:08:02,400 --> 00:08:06,070
about my head now maybe i'm
uh i'm more average than i thought

424
00:08:06,070 --> 00:08:06,080
uh i'm more average than i thought
 

425
00:08:06,080 --> 00:08:08,629
uh i'm more average than i thought
okay so what else is there interesting

426
00:08:08,629 --> 00:08:08,639
okay so what else is there interesting
 

427
00:08:08,639 --> 00:08:09,749
okay so what else is there interesting
you could say what's up

428
00:08:09,749 --> 00:08:09,759
you could say what's up
 

429
00:08:09,759 --> 00:08:11,350
you could say what's up
while it's on our heads i can keep this

430
00:08:11,350 --> 00:08:11,360
while it's on our heads i can keep this
 

431
00:08:11,360 --> 00:08:12,550
while it's on our heads i can keep this
on the whole time this is kind of

432
00:08:12,550 --> 00:08:12,560
on the whole time this is kind of
 

433
00:08:12,560 --> 00:08:13,430
on the whole time this is kind of
awesome

434
00:08:13,430 --> 00:08:13,440
awesome
 

435
00:08:13,440 --> 00:08:15,510
awesome
and it's amazing for me as a fan of

436
00:08:15,510 --> 00:08:15,520
and it's amazing for me as a fan of
 

437
00:08:15,520 --> 00:08:17,350
and it's amazing for me as a fan of
ubuntu i use a bunch of mate you guys

438
00:08:17,350 --> 00:08:17,360
ubuntu i use a bunch of mate you guys
 

439
00:08:17,360 --> 00:08:17,909
ubuntu i use a bunch of mate you guys
should use

440
00:08:17,909 --> 00:08:17,919
should use
 

441
00:08:17,919 --> 00:08:21,350
should use
that too but it's amazing to have code

442
00:08:21,350 --> 00:08:21,360
that too but it's amazing to have code
 

443
00:08:21,360 --> 00:08:22,390
that too but it's amazing to have code
running

444
00:08:22,390 --> 00:08:22,400
running
 

445
00:08:22,400 --> 00:08:24,390
running
to the side measuring stuff and

446
00:08:24,390 --> 00:08:24,400
to the side measuring stuff and
 

447
00:08:24,400 --> 00:08:26,070
to the side measuring stuff and
collecting data

448
00:08:26,070 --> 00:08:26,080
collecting data
 

449
00:08:26,080 --> 00:08:29,350
collecting data
i mean that i just i feel like much more

450
00:08:29,350 --> 00:08:29,360
i mean that i just i feel like much more
 

451
00:08:29,360 --> 00:08:30,230
i mean that i just i feel like much more
important now

452
00:08:30,230 --> 00:08:30,240
important now
 

453
00:08:30,240 --> 00:08:32,630
important now
that my data is being recorded like

454
00:08:32,630 --> 00:08:32,640
that my data is being recorded like
 

455
00:08:32,640 --> 00:08:33,350
that my data is being recorded like
somebody care

456
00:08:33,350 --> 00:08:33,360
somebody care
 

457
00:08:33,360 --> 00:08:34,949
somebody care
like you know when you you have a good

upon two what a cool perspective i

472
00:08:49,110 --> 00:08:49,120
upon two what a cool perspective i
 

473
00:08:49,120 --> 00:08:50,550
upon two what a cool perspective i
hadn't thought about that

474
00:08:50,550 --> 00:08:50,560
hadn't thought about that
 

475
00:08:50,560 --> 00:08:54,630
hadn't thought about that
of feeling understood yeah heard

476
00:08:54,630 --> 00:08:54,640
of feeling understood yeah heard
 

477
00:08:54,640 --> 00:08:58,389
of feeling understood yeah heard
yeah heard deeply by the mechanical

478
00:08:58,389 --> 00:08:58,399
yeah heard deeply by the mechanical
 

479
00:08:58,399 --> 00:08:59,110

00:09:18,240 --> 00:09:19,110
this system in ways that you couldn't
before

502
00:09:19,110 --> 00:09:19,120
before
 

503
00:09:19,120 --> 00:09:24,389
before
yeah i feel heard

504
00:09:24,389 --> 00:09:24,399

 

505
00:09:24,399 --> 00:09:25,670

yeah i mean i guess what's interesting

506
00:09:25,670 --> 00:09:25,680
yeah i mean i guess what's interesting
 

507
00:09:25,680 --> 00:09:28,070
yeah i mean i guess what's interesting
about this is your intuitions are

508
00:09:28,070 --> 00:09:28,080
about this is your intuitions are
 

509
00:09:28,080 --> 00:09:29,829
about this is your intuitions are
spot on most people have intuitions

510
00:09:29,829 --> 00:09:29,839
spot on most people have intuitions
 

511
00:09:29,839 --> 00:09:31,750
spot on most people have intuitions
about brain interfaces that

512
00:09:31,750 --> 00:09:31,760
about brain interfaces that
 

513
00:09:31,760 --> 00:09:32,949
about brain interfaces that
they've grown up with this idea of

514
00:09:32,949 --> 00:09:32,959
they've grown up with this idea of
 

515
00:09:32,959 --> 00:09:35,509
they've grown up with this idea of
people moving cursors on the screen or

516
00:09:35,509 --> 00:09:35,519
people moving cursors on the screen or
 

517
00:09:35,519 --> 00:09:37,829
people moving cursors on the screen or
typing or changing the channel or

518
00:09:37,829 --> 00:09:37,839
typing or changing the channel or
 

519
00:09:37,839 --> 00:09:39,030
typing or changing the channel or
skipping a song it's

520
00:09:39,030 --> 00:09:39,040
skipping a song it's
 

521
00:09:39,040 --> 00:09:42,470
skipping a song it's
primarily been anchored on control and

522
00:09:42,470 --> 00:09:42,480
primarily been anchored on control and
 

523
00:09:42,480 --> 00:09:44,790
primarily been anchored on control and
i think the more relevant understanding

524
00:09:44,790 --> 00:09:44,800
i think the more relevant understanding
 

525
00:09:44,800 --> 00:09:45,509
i think the more relevant understanding
of brain

526
00:09:45,509 --> 00:09:45,519
of brain
 

527
00:09:45,519 --> 00:09:47,670
of brain
interfaces or neural imaging is that

528
00:09:47,670 --> 00:09:47,680
interfaces or neural imaging is that
 

529
00:09:47,680 --> 00:09:49,670
interfaces or neural imaging is that
it's a measurement system

530
00:09:49,670 --> 00:09:49,680
it's a measurement system
 

531
00:09:49,680 --> 00:09:52,230
it's a measurement system
and once you have numbers for a given

532
00:09:52,230 --> 00:09:52,240
and once you have numbers for a given
 

533
00:09:52,240 --> 00:09:53,110
and once you have numbers for a given
thing

534
00:09:53,110 --> 00:09:53,120
thing
 

535
00:09:53,120 --> 00:09:54,230
thing
a seemingly endless number of

536
00:09:54,230 --> 00:09:54,240
a seemingly endless number of
 

537
00:09:54,240 --> 00:09:56,150
a seemingly endless number of
possibilities emerge around that of what

538
00:09:56,150 --> 00:09:56,160
possibilities emerge around that of what
 

539
00:09:56,160 --> 00:09:57,670
possibilities emerge around that of what
to do with those numbers

540
00:09:57,670 --> 00:09:57,680
to do with those numbers
 

541
00:09:57,680 --> 00:09:59,110
to do with those numbers
so before you tell me about the

542
00:09:59,110 --> 00:09:59,120
so before you tell me about the
 

543
00:09:59,120 --> 00:10:00,710
so before you tell me about the
possibilities this was an incredible

544
00:10:00,710 --> 00:10:00,720
possibilities this was an incredible
 

545
00:10:00,720 --> 00:10:01,430
possibilities this was an incredible
experience

546
00:10:01,430 --> 00:10:01,440
experience
 

547
00:10:01,440 --> 00:10:03,750
experience
i can keep this on for another two hours

548
00:10:03,750 --> 00:10:03,760
i can keep this on for another two hours
 

549
00:10:03,760 --> 00:10:04,949
i can keep this on for another two hours
but i'm being

550
00:10:04,949 --> 00:10:04,959
but i'm being
 

551
00:10:04,959 --> 00:10:08,870
but i'm being
told that uh for a bunch of reasons

552
00:10:08,870 --> 00:10:08,880
told that uh for a bunch of reasons
 

553
00:10:08,880 --> 00:10:10,310
told that uh for a bunch of reasons
just because we probably want to keep

554
00:10:10,310 --> 00:10:10,320
just because we probably want to keep
 

555
00:10:10,320 --> 00:10:12,710
just because we probably want to keep
the data small and visualize it nicely

556
00:10:12,710 --> 00:10:12,720
the data small and visualize it nicely
 

557
00:10:12,720 --> 00:10:14,389
the data small and visualize it nicely
for the final product we want to cut

558
00:10:14,389 --> 00:10:14,399
for the final product we want to cut
 

559
00:10:14,399 --> 00:10:15,990
for the final product we want to cut
this off and take this

560
00:10:15,990 --> 00:10:16,000
this off and take this
 

561
00:10:16,000 --> 00:10:17,910
this off and take this
to take this amazing helmet away from me

562
00:10:17,910 --> 00:10:17,920
to take this amazing helmet away from me
 

563
00:10:17,920 --> 00:10:19,030
to take this amazing helmet away from me
so

564
00:10:19,030 --> 00:10:19,040
so
 

565
00:10:19,040 --> 00:10:20,389
so
brian thank you so much for this

566
00:10:20,389 --> 00:10:20,399
brian thank you so much for this
 

567
00:10:20,399 --> 00:10:22,150
brian thank you so much for this
experience and let's uh

568
00:10:22,150 --> 00:10:22,160
experience and let's uh
 

569
00:10:22,160 --> 00:10:25,190
experience and let's uh
let's continue without helmetless all

570
00:10:25,190 --> 00:10:25,200
let's continue without helmetless all
 

571
00:10:25,200 --> 00:10:26,069
let's continue without helmetless all
right

572
00:10:26,069 --> 00:10:26,079
right
 

573
00:10:26,079 --> 00:10:28,790
right
so that was an incredible experience uh

574
00:10:28,790 --> 00:10:28,800
so that was an incredible experience uh
 

575
00:10:28,800 --> 00:10:29,910
so that was an incredible experience uh
can you maybe speak to

576
00:10:29,910 --> 00:10:29,920
can you maybe speak to
 

577
00:10:29,920 --> 00:10:31,910
can you maybe speak to
what kind of opportunities that opens up

578
00:10:31,910 --> 00:10:31,920
what kind of opportunities that opens up
 

579
00:10:31,920 --> 00:10:33,670
what kind of opportunities that opens up
that stream of data that rich stream of

580
00:10:33,670 --> 00:10:33,680
that stream of data that rich stream of
 

581
00:10:33,680 --> 00:10:35,430
that stream of data that rich stream of
data from the brain

582
00:10:35,430 --> 00:10:35,440
data from the brain
 

583
00:10:35,440 --> 00:10:38,310
data from the brain
first i'm curious what is your reaction

584
00:10:38,310 --> 00:10:38,320
first i'm curious what is your reaction
 

585
00:10:38,320 --> 00:10:38,949
first i'm curious what is your reaction
what

586
00:10:38,949 --> 00:10:38,959
what
 

587
00:10:38,959 --> 00:10:41,030
what
what comes to mind when you put that on

588
00:10:41,030 --> 00:10:41,040
what comes to mind when you put that on
 

589
00:10:41,040 --> 00:10:42,710
what comes to mind when you put that on
your head what does it mean to you

590
00:10:42,710 --> 00:10:42,720
your head what does it mean to you
 

591
00:10:42,720 --> 00:10:45,190
your head what does it mean to you
and what possibilities emerge and what

592
00:10:45,190 --> 00:10:45,200
and what possibilities emerge and what
 

593
00:10:45,200 --> 00:10:46,870
and what possibilities emerge and what
significance might it have i mean i'm

594
00:10:46,870 --> 00:10:46,880
significance might it have i mean i'm
 

595
00:10:46,880 --> 00:10:47,990
significance might it have i mean i'm
curious where

596
00:10:47,990 --> 00:10:48,000
curious where
 

597
00:10:48,000 --> 00:10:51,350
curious where
your orientation is at well

598
00:10:51,350 --> 00:10:51,360
your orientation is at well
 

599
00:10:51,360 --> 00:10:53,990
your orientation is at well
for me i'm really excited by the

600
00:10:53,990 --> 00:10:54,000
for me i'm really excited by the
 

601
00:10:54,000 --> 00:10:57,509
for me i'm really excited by the
possibility of

602
00:10:57,509 --> 00:10:57,519

 

603
00:10:57,519 --> 00:10:59,750

various information about my body about

604
00:10:59,750 --> 00:10:59,760
various information about my body about
 

605
00:10:59,760 --> 00:11:01,829
various information about my body about
my mind

606
00:11:01,829 --> 00:11:01,839
my mind
 

607
00:11:01,839 --> 00:11:03,990
my mind
being converted into data such that data

608
00:11:03,990 --> 00:11:04,000
being converted into data such that data
 

609
00:11:04,000 --> 00:11:05,190
being converted into data such that data
can be used to create

610
00:11:05,190 --> 00:11:05,200
can be used to create
 

611
00:11:05,200 --> 00:11:07,430
can be used to create
products that make my life better so

612
00:11:07,430 --> 00:11:07,440
products that make my life better so
 

613
00:11:07,440 --> 00:11:08,790
products that make my life better so
that that means really exciting

614
00:11:08,790 --> 00:11:08,800
that that means really exciting
 

615
00:11:08,800 --> 00:11:09,670
that that means really exciting
possibility

616
00:11:09,670 --> 00:11:09,680
possibility
 

617
00:11:09,680 --> 00:11:12,150
possibility
even just like a fitbit that measures i

618
00:11:12,150 --> 00:11:12,160
even just like a fitbit that measures i
 

619
00:11:12,160 --> 00:11:12,949
even just like a fitbit that measures i
don't know

620
00:11:12,949 --> 00:11:12,959
don't know
 

621
00:11:12,959 --> 00:11:15,110
don't know
some very basic measurements about your

622
00:11:15,110 --> 00:11:15,120
some very basic measurements about your
 

623
00:11:15,120 --> 00:11:17,030
some very basic measurements about your
body is really cool

624
00:11:17,030 --> 00:11:17,040
body is really cool
 

625
00:11:17,040 --> 00:11:19,190
body is really cool
but it's the the bandwidth of

626
00:11:19,190 --> 00:11:19,200
but it's the the bandwidth of
 

627
00:11:19,200 --> 00:11:20,389
but it's the the bandwidth of
information

628

information
 

629
00:11:20,399 --> 00:11:21,990
information
the resolution of that information is

630
00:11:21,990 --> 00:11:22,000
the resolution of that information is
 

631
00:11:22,000 --> 00:11:23,829
the resolution of that information is
very crude so it's not very interesting

632
00:11:23,829 --> 00:11:23,839
very crude so it's not very interesting
 

633
00:11:23,839 --> 00:11:26,710
very crude so it's not very interesting
the possibility of recording of just

the possibility of recording of just
 

635
00:11:26,720 --> 00:11:29,430
the possibility of recording of just
building a data set

636
00:11:29,430 --> 00:11:29,440
building a data set
 

637
00:11:29,440 --> 00:11:31,670
building a data set
coming in a clean way in a high

my brain opens up uh
all kinds of you know at the very i was

644
00:11:39,350 --> 00:11:39,360
all kinds of you know at the very i was
 

645
00:11:39,360 --> 00:11:41,430
all kinds of you know at the very i was
kind of joking when we're talking but

646
00:11:41,430 --> 00:11:41,440
kind of joking when we're talking but
 

647
00:11:41,440 --> 00:11:44,550
kind of joking when we're talking but
it's not really it's like i feel heard

648
00:11:44,550 --> 00:11:44,560
it's not really it's like i feel heard
 

649
00:11:44,560 --> 00:11:47,590
it's not really it's like i feel heard
in the sense that it feels like

00:11:47,590 --> 00:11:47,600
in the sense that it feels like
 

651
00:11:47,600 --> 00:11:50,150
in the sense that it feels like
the full richness of the information

i can't quite put it into words but

00:12:00,230 --> 00:12:00,240
i can't quite put it into words but
 

661
00:12:00,240 --> 00:12:02,710
i can't quite put it into words but
there is a genuinely for me

there is a genuinely for me
 

663
00:12:02,720 --> 00:12:04,310
there is a genuinely for me
this is not some kind of joke about me

this is not some kind of joke about me
 

665
00:12:04,320 --> 00:12:06,230
this is not some kind of joke about me
being a robot is this genuinely feels

being a robot is this genuinely feels
like i'm being

668
00:12:07,670 --> 00:12:07,680
like i'm being
 

669
00:12:07,680 --> 00:12:11,509
like i'm being
heard uh in a way that uh

670
00:12:11,509 --> 00:12:11,519
heard uh in a way that uh
 

671
00:12:11,519 --> 00:12:14,310
heard uh in a way that uh
that's going to improve my life as long

672
00:12:14,310 --> 00:12:14,320
that's going to improve my life as long
 

673
00:12:14,320 --> 00:12:16,230
that's going to improve my life as long
as the thing that's on the other end

674
00:12:16,230 --> 00:12:16,240
as the thing that's on the other end
 

675
00:12:16,240 --> 00:12:17,670
as the thing that's on the other end
can do something useful with that data

676
00:12:17,670 --> 00:12:17,680
can do something useful with that data
 

677
00:12:17,680 --> 00:12:19,829
can do something useful with that data
but even the the recording itself

678
00:12:19,829 --> 00:12:19,839
but even the the recording itself
 

679
00:12:19,839 --> 00:12:23,269
but even the the recording itself
is like once you record it's like taking

680
00:12:23,269 --> 00:12:23,279
is like once you record it's like taking
 

681
00:12:23,279 --> 00:12:25,269
is like once you record it's like taking
a picture

682
00:12:25,269 --> 00:12:25,279
a picture
 

683
00:12:25,279 --> 00:12:28,389
a picture
that moment is forever saved in time

684
00:12:28,389 --> 00:12:28,399
that moment is forever saved in time
 

685
00:12:28,399 --> 00:12:32,310
that moment is forever saved in time
now a picture cannot allow you to step

686
00:12:32,310 --> 00:12:32,320
now a picture cannot allow you to step
 

687
00:12:32,320 --> 00:12:32,710
now a picture cannot allow you to step
back

688
00:12:32,710 --> 00:12:32,720
back
 

689
00:12:32,720 --> 00:12:35,990
back
into that world but perhaps

690
00:12:35,990 --> 00:12:36,000
into that world but perhaps
 

691
00:12:36,000 --> 00:12:39,030
into that world but perhaps
recording your brain is a much higher

692
00:12:39,030 --> 00:12:39,040
recording your brain is a much higher
 

693
00:12:39,040 --> 00:12:41,110
recording your brain is a much higher
resolution thing

694
00:12:41,110 --> 00:12:41,120
resolution thing
 

695
00:12:41,120 --> 00:12:44,150
resolution thing
much more personal recording of that

696
00:12:44,150 --> 00:12:44,160
much more personal recording of that
 

697
00:12:44,160 --> 00:12:46,069
much more personal recording of that
information than a picture

698
00:12:46,069 --> 00:12:46,079
information than a picture
 

699
00:12:46,079 --> 00:12:48,230
information than a picture
that would allow you to step back into

700
00:12:48,230 --> 00:12:48,240
that would allow you to step back into
 

701
00:12:48,240 --> 00:12:49,269
that would allow you to step back into
that

702
00:12:49,269 --> 00:12:49,279
that
 

703
00:12:49,279 --> 00:12:51,670
that
where you were in that particular moment

704
00:12:51,670 --> 00:12:51,680
where you were in that particular moment
 

705
00:12:51,680 --> 00:12:52,389
where you were in that particular moment
in history

706
00:12:52,389 --> 00:12:52,399
in history
 

707
00:12:52,399 --> 00:12:54,230
in history
and then map out a certain trajectory to

708
00:12:54,230 --> 00:12:54,240
and then map out a certain trajectory to
 

709
00:12:54,240 --> 00:12:56,790
and then map out a certain trajectory to
tell you certain things about

710
00:12:56,790 --> 00:12:56,800
tell you certain things about
 

711
00:12:56,800 --> 00:12:59,190
tell you certain things about
uh about yourself that could open up all

712
00:12:59,190 --> 00:12:59,200
uh about yourself that could open up all
 

713
00:12:59,200 --> 00:13:00,310
uh about yourself that could open up all
kinds of applications

714
00:13:00,310 --> 00:13:00,320
kinds of applications
 

715
00:13:00,320 --> 00:13:02,550
kinds of applications
of course there's health that i consider

716
00:13:02,550 --> 00:13:02,560
of course there's health that i consider
 

717
00:13:02,560 --> 00:13:03,670
of course there's health that i consider
but honestly

718
00:13:03,670 --> 00:13:03,680
but honestly
 

719
00:13:03,680 --> 00:13:05,590
but honestly
to me the exciting thing is just being

720
00:13:05,590 --> 00:13:05,600
to me the exciting thing is just being
 

721
00:13:05,600 --> 00:13:07,670
to me the exciting thing is just being
heard my state of mind

722
00:13:07,670 --> 00:13:07,680
heard my state of mind
 

723
00:13:07,680 --> 00:13:09,509
heard my state of mind
the level of focus all those kinds of

724
00:13:09,509 --> 00:13:09,519
the level of focus all those kinds of
 

725
00:13:09,519 --> 00:13:10,790
the level of focus all those kinds of

what i heard you say is you have an
 

729
00:13:12,800 --> 00:13:14,470

00:13:16,399 --> 00:13:17,750
lived experience some of which you can
communicate in words

734
00:13:17,750 --> 00:13:17,760
communicate in words
 

735
00:13:17,760 --> 00:13:20,470
communicate in words
and in body language some of which you

00:13:20,470 --> 00:13:20,480
and in body language some of which you
 

737
00:13:20,480 --> 00:13:21,350
and in body language some of which you
feel internally

measurement system
 

745
00:13:26,560 --> 00:13:29,110
measurement system
captures both the things you can try to

746
00:13:29,110 --> 00:13:29,120
captures both the things you can try to
 

747
00:13:29,120 --> 00:13:30,470
captures both the things you can try to
articulate in words maybe in a lower

00:13:30,470 --> 00:13:30,480
articulate in words maybe in a lower
 

749
00:13:30,480 --> 00:13:31,110

dimensional

750

communicate focus
yeah when it really may be represented

756
00:13:35,509 --> 00:13:35,519
yeah when it really may be represented
 

757
00:13:35,519 --> 00:13:37,430
yeah when it really may be represented
in a 20 dimensional space of

758
00:13:37,430 --> 00:13:37,440
in a 20 dimensional space of
 

759
00:13:37,440 --> 00:13:40,470
in a 20 dimensional space of
this particular kind of focus and that

760
00:13:40,470 --> 00:13:40,480
this particular kind of focus and that
 

761
00:13:40,480 --> 00:13:42,629
this particular kind of focus and that
this information is being captured so

762
00:13:42,629 --> 00:13:42,639
this information is being captured so
 

763
00:13:42,639 --> 00:13:44,629
this information is being captured so
it's a closer representation to the

764
00:13:44,629 --> 00:13:44,639
it's a closer representation to the
 

765
00:13:44,639 --> 00:13:46,069
it's a closer representation to the
entirety

766
00:13:46,069 --> 00:13:46,079
entirety
 

767
00:13:46,079 --> 00:13:47,990
entirety
of your experience captured in a dynamic

00:13:47,990 --> 00:13:48,000
of your experience captured in a dynamic
 

769
00:13:48,000 --> 00:13:49,269
of your experience captured in a dynamic
fashion that is not just

770
00:13:49,269 --> 00:13:49,279
fashion that is not just
 

771
00:13:49,279 --> 00:13:52,069
fashion that is not just
a static image of your conscious

772
00:13:52,069 --> 00:13:52,079
a static image of your conscious
 

773
00:13:52,079 --> 00:13:53,030
a static image of your conscious

experience
 

775
00:13:53,040 --> 00:13:55,910
experience
yeah yeah that that's that's that's the

776
00:13:55,910 --> 00:13:55,920
yeah yeah that that's that's that's the
 

777
00:13:55,920 --> 00:13:57,350
yeah yeah that that's that's that's the
promise that's the hope that was the

778
00:13:57,350 --> 00:13:57,360
promise that's the hope that was the
 

779
00:13:57,360 --> 00:13:58,150
promise that's the hope that was the
feeling

780
00:13:58,150 --> 00:13:58,160
feeling
 

781
00:13:58,160 --> 00:13:59,910
feeling
and it felt like the future so it's a

782
00:13:59,910 --> 00:13:59,920
and it felt like the future so it's a
 

783
00:13:59,920 --> 00:14:02,069
and it felt like the future so it's a
pretty cool experience and from the sort

784
00:14:02,069 --> 00:14:02,079
pretty cool experience and from the sort
 

785
00:14:02,079 --> 00:14:02,710
pretty cool experience and from the sort
of

786
00:14:02,710 --> 00:14:02,720
of
 

787
00:14:02,720 --> 00:14:05,189
of
mechanical perspective it was cool to

788
00:14:05,189 --> 00:14:05,199
mechanical perspective it was cool to
 

789
00:14:05,199 --> 00:14:07,030
mechanical perspective it was cool to
have an actual device that

790
00:14:07,030 --> 00:14:07,040
have an actual device that
 

791
00:14:07,040 --> 00:14:09,670
have an actual device that
feels pretty good that doesn't uh

792
00:14:09,670 --> 00:14:09,680
feels pretty good that doesn't uh
 

793
00:14:09,680 --> 00:14:11,590
feels pretty good that doesn't uh
doesn't require me to go into the lab

794
00:14:11,590 --> 00:14:11,600
doesn't require me to go into the lab
 

795
00:14:11,600 --> 00:14:13,269
doesn't require me to go into the lab
and also the other thing i was i was

796
00:14:13,269 --> 00:14:13,279
and also the other thing i was i was
 

797
00:14:13,279 --> 00:14:15,430
and also the other thing i was i was
feeling there's a guy named andrew

798
00:14:15,430 --> 00:14:15,440
feeling there's a guy named andrew
 

799
00:14:15,440 --> 00:14:15,990

we're working on a paper together about

808
00:14:24,230 --> 00:14:24,240
we're working on a paper together about
 

809
00:14:24,240 --> 00:14:26,310
we're working on a paper together about
eye movement and so on

810

eye movement and so on
 

811
00:14:26,320 --> 00:14:28,310
eye movement and so on
and we're kind of he's a neuroscientist

and we're kind of he's a neuroscientist
 

813
00:14:28,320 --> 00:14:29,829
and we're kind of he's a neuroscientist
and i'm a data person a machine learning

814
00:14:29,829 --> 00:14:29,839
and i'm a data person a machine learning
 

815
00:14:29,839 --> 00:14:30,870
and i'm a data person a machine learning
person and

we're we're both excited by
 

819
00:14:34,720 --> 00:14:38,629
we're we're both excited by
how much the that

820
00:14:38,629 --> 00:14:38,639
how much the that
 

821
00:14:38,639 --> 00:14:41,910
how much the that
how much the data measurements of the

822
00:14:41,910 --> 00:14:41,920
how much the data measurements of the
 

823
00:14:41,920 --> 00:14:42,790
how much the data measurements of the
human mind

824
00:14:42,790 --> 00:14:42,800
human mind
 

825
00:14:42,800 --> 00:14:44,710
human mind
the brain and all the different metrics

826
00:14:44,710 --> 00:14:44,720
the brain and all the different metrics
 

827
00:14:44,720 --> 00:14:45,829
the brain and all the different metrics
that come from that

828
00:14:45,829 --> 00:14:45,839
that come from that
 

829
00:14:45,839 --> 00:14:48,790
that come from that
can be used to understand human beings

830
00:14:48,790 --> 00:14:48,800
can be used to understand human beings
 

831
00:14:48,800 --> 00:14:49,110
can be used to understand human beings
and

832
00:14:49,110 --> 00:14:49,120
and
 

833
00:14:49,120 --> 00:14:50,710
and
in a rigorous scientific way so the

834
00:14:50,710 --> 00:14:50,720
in a rigorous scientific way so the
 

835
00:14:50,720 --> 00:14:52,230
in a rigorous scientific way so the
other thing i was thinking about is how

836
00:14:52,230 --> 00:14:52,240
other thing i was thinking about is how
 

837
00:14:52,240 --> 00:14:53,910
other thing i was thinking about is how
this could be turned into

838
00:14:53,910 --> 00:14:53,920
this could be turned into
 

839
00:14:53,920 --> 00:14:56,710
this could be turned into
a tool for science sort of not just

840
00:14:56,710 --> 00:14:56,720
a tool for science sort of not just
 

841
00:14:56,720 --> 00:14:58,389
a tool for science sort of not just
personal science not just like

842
00:14:58,389 --> 00:14:58,399
personal science not just like
 

843
00:14:58,399 --> 00:15:02,389
personal science not just like
fitbit style like uh how am i doing

844
00:15:02,389 --> 00:15:02,399
fitbit style like uh how am i doing
 

845
00:15:02,399 --> 00:15:04,870
fitbit style like uh how am i doing
my personal metrics of health but doing

846
00:15:04,870 --> 00:15:04,880
my personal metrics of health but doing
 

847
00:15:04,880 --> 00:15:07,030
my personal metrics of health but doing
larger scale studies of human behavior

848
00:15:07,030 --> 00:15:07,040
larger scale studies of human behavior
 

849
00:15:07,040 --> 00:15:07,670
larger scale studies of human behavior
and so on

850
00:15:07,670 --> 00:15:07,680
and so on
 

851
00:15:07,680 --> 00:15:09,910
and so on
so like data not at the scale of an

852
00:15:09,910 --> 00:15:09,920
so like data not at the scale of an
 

853
00:15:09,920 --> 00:15:11,750
so like data not at the scale of an
individual but data at a scale of many

854
00:15:11,750 --> 00:15:11,760
individual but data at a scale of many
 

855
00:15:11,760 --> 00:15:13,110
individual but data at a scale of many
individuals or a large number of

856
00:15:13,110 --> 00:15:13,120
individuals or a large number of
 

857
00:15:13,120 --> 00:15:13,990
individuals or a large number of
individuals so

858
00:15:13,990 --> 00:15:14,000
individuals so
 

859
00:15:14,000 --> 00:15:16,470
individuals so
science so it's personal being heard was

860
00:15:16,470 --> 00:15:16,480
science so it's personal being heard was
 

861
00:15:16,480 --> 00:15:17,670
science so it's personal being heard was
exciting and also just

862
00:15:17,670 --> 00:15:17,680
exciting and also just
 

863
00:15:17,680 --> 00:15:21,030
exciting and also just
for science is exciting it's very easy

864
00:15:21,030 --> 00:15:21,040
for science is exciting it's very easy
 

865
00:15:21,040 --> 00:15:23,350
for science is exciting it's very easy
like there's a very powerful thing to it

866
00:15:23,350 --> 00:15:23,360
like there's a very powerful thing to it
 

867
00:15:23,360 --> 00:15:25,590
like there's a very powerful thing to it
being so easy to just put on

868
00:15:25,590 --> 00:15:25,600
being so easy to just put on
 

869
00:15:25,600 --> 00:15:28,550
being so easy to just put on
that you can scale much easier if you

870
00:15:28,550 --> 00:15:28,560
that you can scale much easier if you
 

871
00:15:28,560 --> 00:15:30,069
that you can scale much easier if you
think about the second thing you said

i love that i idea that you kind of
 

1003
00:17:47,679 --> 00:17:48,950
i love that i idea that you kind of
think

1004
00:17:48,950 --> 00:17:48,960
think
 

1005
00:17:48,960 --> 00:17:51,510
think
that there is just this ocean of data

1006
00:17:51,510 --> 00:17:51,520
that there is just this ocean of data
 

1007
00:17:51,520 --> 00:17:53,350
that there is just this ocean of data
that's coming from people's brains as

1008
00:17:53,350 --> 00:17:53,360
that's coming from people's brains as
 

1009
00:17:53,360 --> 00:17:55,830
that's coming from people's brains as
being in a crude way reduced down to

00:17:55,830 --> 00:17:55,840
being in a crude way reduced down to

00:17:55,840 --> 00:17:56,870
being in a crude way reduced down to

like
 

1013
00:17:56,880 --> 00:18:00,470
like
tweets and texts and so on just a very

1014
00:18:00,470 --> 00:18:00,480
tweets and texts and so on just a very
 

1015
00:18:00,480 --> 00:18:04,230
tweets and texts and so on just a very
hardcore mini scale compression of

hardcore mini scale compression of
 

1017
00:18:04,240 --> 00:18:07,430
hardcore mini scale compression of
actual the raw data but maybe you can

actual the raw data but maybe you can

because you use the word cognition

1022
00:18:11,669 --> 00:18:11,679
because you use the word cognition
 

1023
00:18:11,679 --> 00:18:13,750
because you use the word cognition
i think the first step is to get the

1024
00:18:13,750 --> 00:18:13,760
i think the first step is to get the
 

1025
00:18:13,760 --> 00:18:15,190
i think the first step is to get the
brain data

1026
00:18:15,190 --> 00:18:15,200
brain data
 

1027
00:18:15,200 --> 00:18:18,230
brain data
but um is there a leap

1028
00:18:18,230 --> 00:18:18,240
but um is there a leap
 

1029
00:18:18,240 --> 00:18:20,150
but um is there a leap
to be taking to sort of interpreting

1030
00:18:20,150 --> 00:18:20,160
to be taking to sort of interpreting
 

1031
00:18:20,160 --> 00:18:22,070
to be taking to sort of interpreting
that data in terms of cognition

1032
00:18:22,070 --> 00:18:22,080
that data in terms of cognition
 

1033
00:18:22,080 --> 00:18:24,150
that data in terms of cognition
so is your is your ideas basically you

1034
00:18:24,150 --> 00:18:24,160
so is your is your ideas basically you
 

1035
00:18:24,160 --> 00:18:26,789
so is your is your ideas basically you
need to start collecting data at scale

1036
00:18:26,789 --> 00:18:26,799
need to start collecting data at scale
 

1037
00:18:26,799 --> 00:18:28,710
need to start collecting data at scale
from the brain and then we start to

1038
00:18:28,710 --> 00:18:28,720
from the brain and then we start to
 

1039
00:18:28,720 --> 00:18:30,390
from the brain and then we start to
really be able to

1040
00:18:30,390 --> 00:18:30,400
really be able to
 

1041
00:18:30,400 --> 00:18:33,830
really be able to
take little steps along the path to

1042
00:18:33,830 --> 00:18:33,840
take little steps along the path to
 

1043
00:18:33,840 --> 00:18:34,789
take little steps along the path to
actually

1044
00:18:34,789 --> 00:18:34,799
actually
 

1045
00:18:34,799 --> 00:18:37,669
actually
measuring some deep sense of cognition

1046
00:18:37,669 --> 00:18:37,679
measuring some deep sense of cognition
 

1047
00:18:37,679 --> 00:18:38,710
measuring some deep sense of cognition
because it's

1048
00:18:38,710 --> 00:18:38,720
because it's
 

1049
00:18:38,720 --> 00:18:41,430
because it's
you know as i'm sure you know we don't

you know as i'm sure you know we don't
 

1051
00:18:41,440 --> 00:18:42,390
you know as i'm sure you know we don't
we understand

00:18:42,390 --> 00:18:42,400
we understand
 

1053
00:18:42,400 --> 00:18:44,230
we understand
a few things but we don't understand

a few things but we don't understand
most of what makes up cognition

00:18:47,190 --> 00:18:47,200
most of what makes up cognition
 

1057
00:18:47,200 --> 00:18:49,110
most of what makes up cognition
this has been one of the most

been
 

1111
00:19:33,200 --> 00:19:35,029
been
so i've funded the first 53 million

1112

00:19:46,150 --> 00:19:46,160
was
 

1125
00:19:46,160 --> 00:19:48,789
was
mostly around this concept around what

1126
00:19:48,789 --> 00:19:48,799
mostly around this concept around what
 

1127
00:19:48,799 --> 00:19:50,070
mostly around this concept around what
is a killer app and

1128
00:19:50,070 --> 00:19:50,080
is a killer app and
 

1129
00:19:50,080 --> 00:19:51,590
is a killer app and
so internally the way we think about it

1130
00:19:51,590 --> 00:19:51,600
so internally the way we think about it
 

1131
00:19:51,600 --> 00:19:53,990
so internally the way we think about it
is we think of the

1132
00:19:53,990 --> 00:19:54,000
is we think of the
 

1133
00:19:54,000 --> 00:19:55,909
is we think of the
the go-to-market strategy much more like

1134
00:19:55,909 --> 00:19:55,919
the go-to-market strategy much more like
 

1135
00:19:55,919 --> 00:19:57,830
the go-to-market strategy much more like
the drake equation

1136
00:19:57,830 --> 00:19:57,840
the drake equation
 

1137
00:19:57,840 --> 00:20:00,710
the drake equation
where if we can build technology that

1138
00:20:00,710 --> 00:20:00,720
where if we can build technology that
 

1139
00:20:00,720 --> 00:20:01,110
where if we can build technology that
has

1140
00:20:01,110 --> 00:20:01,120
has
 

1141
00:20:01,120 --> 00:20:04,149
has
the characteristics of it has the data

1142
00:20:04,149 --> 00:20:04,159
the characteristics of it has the data
 

1143
00:20:04,159 --> 00:20:05,510
the characteristics of it has the data
quality is high enough it meets some

1145
00:20:05,520 --> 00:20:07,510
quality is high enough it meets some
certain threshold

1146
00:20:07,510 --> 00:20:07,520
certain threshold
 

1147
00:20:07,520 --> 00:20:11,029
certain threshold
cost accessibility comfort

1148
00:20:11,029 --> 00:20:11,039
cost accessibility comfort
 

1149
00:20:11,039 --> 00:20:12,070
cost accessibility comfort
it can be worn in contextual

1150
00:20:12,070 --> 00:20:12,080
it can be worn in contextual
 

1151
00:20:12,080 --> 00:20:14,710
it can be worn in contextual
environments if it meets the criteria

1152
00:20:14,710 --> 00:20:14,720
environments if it meets the criteria
 

1153
00:20:14,720 --> 00:20:19,430
environments if it meets the criteria
of being a mass-market device then

1154
00:20:19,430 --> 00:20:19,440
of being a mass-market device then
 

1155
00:20:19,440 --> 00:20:21,750
of being a mass-market device then
the responsibility that we have is to

1156
00:20:21,750 --> 00:20:21,760
the responsibility that we have is to
 

1157
00:20:21,760 --> 00:20:22,950
the responsibility that we have is to
figure out how to

1158
00:20:22,950 --> 00:20:22,960
figure out how to
 

1159
00:20:22,960 --> 00:20:26,789
figure out how to
create the algorithm that enables

1160
00:20:26,789 --> 00:20:26,799
create the algorithm that enables
 

1161
00:20:26,799 --> 00:20:29,830
create the algorithm that enables
the human to enable

1162
00:20:29,830 --> 00:20:29,840
the human to enable
 

1163
00:20:29,840 --> 00:20:31,990
the human to enable
uh humans to then find value with it

1164
00:20:31,990 --> 00:20:32,000
uh humans to then find value with it
 

1165
00:20:32,000 --> 00:20:34,230
uh humans to then find value with it
okay so it so the analogy is like

1166
00:20:34,230 --> 00:20:34,240
okay so it so the analogy is like
 

1167
00:20:34,240 --> 00:20:35,830
okay so it so the analogy is like
brain interfaces are like early 90s of

the internet is you
 

1171
00:20:37,520 --> 00:20:39,590
the internet is you
you want to populate an ecosystem with a

you want to populate an ecosystem with a
 

1173
00:20:39,600 --> 00:20:40,789
you want to populate an ecosystem with a
certain number of devices you want a

certain number of people
who play around with them who do

1178
00:20:42,870 --> 00:20:42,880
who play around with them who do
 

1179
00:20:42,880 --> 00:20:43,990
who play around with them who do
experiments of certain data collection

1180
00:20:43,990 --> 00:20:44,000
experiments of certain data collection
 

1181
00:20:44,000 --> 00:20:45,750

00:20:47,909 --> 00:20:47,919
mistakes from experts to non-experts
 

1185
00:20:47,919 --> 00:20:48,549
mistakes from experts to non-experts
these are all

1186
00:20:48,549 --> 00:20:48,559
these are all
 

1187
00:20:48,559 --> 00:20:51,830
these are all
critical elements that ignite discovery

1188
00:20:51,830 --> 00:20:51,840
critical elements that ignite discovery
 

1189
00:20:51,840 --> 00:20:54,789
critical elements that ignite discovery
and so

1190
00:20:54,789 --> 00:20:54,799

 

1191
00:20:54,799 --> 00:20:57,029

we believe we've accomplished the first

1192
00:20:57,029 --> 00:20:57,039
we believe we've accomplished the first

we believe we've accomplished the first
objective building technology

1194
00:20:59,110 --> 00:20:59,120
objective building technology
 

1195
00:20:59,120 --> 00:21:02,070
objective building technology
that reaches those thresholds and now

1196
00:21:02,070 --> 00:21:02,080
that reaches those thresholds and now
 

1197
00:21:02,080 --> 00:21:04,549
that reaches those thresholds and now
it's the drake equation component of

1198
00:21:04,549 --> 00:21:04,559
it's the drake equation component of
 

1199
00:21:04,559 --> 00:21:08,710
it's the drake equation component of
how do we try to

1200
00:21:08,710 --> 00:21:08,720
how do we try to
 

1201
00:21:08,720 --> 00:21:11,750
how do we try to
generate 20 years of value discovery in

1202
00:21:11,750 --> 00:21:11,760
generate 20 years of value discovery in
 

1203
00:21:11,760 --> 00:21:12,950
generate 20 years of value discovery in
a two or three year time period how do

1204
00:21:12,950 --> 00:21:12,960
a two or three year time period how do
 

1205
00:21:12,960 --> 00:21:14,230
a two or three year time period how do
we compress that

1206
00:21:14,230 --> 00:21:14,240
we compress that
 

1207
00:21:14,240 --> 00:21:15,990
we compress that
so just to clarify so when you mean the

1208
00:21:15,990 --> 00:21:16,000
so just to clarify so when you mean the
 

1209
00:21:16,000 --> 00:21:17,430
so just to clarify so when you mean the
drake equation

1210
00:21:17,430 --> 00:21:17,440
drake equation
 

1211
00:21:17,440 --> 00:21:19,110
drake equation
uh which for people who don't know i

1212
00:21:19,110 --> 00:21:19,120
uh which for people who don't know i
 

1213
00:21:19,120 --> 00:21:20,549
uh which for people who don't know i
don't know why you if you listen to this

1214
00:21:20,549 --> 00:21:20,559
don't know why you if you listen to this
 

1215
00:21:20,559 --> 00:21:21,909
don't know why you if you listen to this
i bring up aliens every single

1216
00:21:21,909 --> 00:21:21,919
i bring up aliens every single
 

1217
00:21:21,919 --> 00:21:22,870
i bring up aliens every single
conversation so

1218
00:21:22,870 --> 00:21:22,880
conversation so
 

1219
00:21:22,880 --> 00:21:23,909
conversation so
it's i don't know how you would know

1220
00:21:23,909 --> 00:21:23,919
it's i don't know how you would know
 

1221
00:21:23,919 --> 00:21:26,390
it's i don't know how you would know
what the drake equation is but you mean

1222
00:21:26,390 --> 00:21:26,400
what the drake equation is but you mean
 

1223
00:21:26,400 --> 00:21:29,350
what the drake equation is but you mean
like the killer app it would be one

1224
00:21:29,350 --> 00:21:29,360
like the killer app it would be one
 

1225
00:21:29,360 --> 00:21:31,190
like the killer app it would be one
alien civilization in that equation

1226
00:21:31,190 --> 00:21:31,200
alien civilization in that equation
 

1227
00:21:31,200 --> 00:21:34,149
alien civilization in that equation
so meaning like this is in search of an

1228
00:21:34,149 --> 00:21:34,159
so meaning like this is in search of an
 

1229
00:21:34,159 --> 00:21:35,110
so meaning like this is in search of an
application that's

1230
00:21:35,110 --> 00:21:35,120
application that's
 

1231
00:21:35,120 --> 00:21:36,789
application that's
impactful transformative by the way it

1232
00:21:36,789 --> 00:21:36,799
impactful transformative by the way it
 

1233
00:21:36,799 --> 00:21:38,230
impactful transformative by the way it
should be a we need to come up with a

1234
00:21:38,230 --> 00:21:38,240
should be a we need to come up with a
 

1235
00:21:38,240 --> 00:21:39,190
should be a we need to come up with a
better term

1236
00:21:39,190 --> 00:21:39,200
better term
 

1237
00:21:39,200 --> 00:21:42,630
better term
than killer app as a it's also violent

1238
00:21:42,630 --> 00:21:42,640
than killer app as a it's also violent
 

1239
00:21:42,640 --> 00:21:43,029
than killer app as a it's also violent
right

1240
00:21:43,029 --> 00:21:43,039
right
 

1241
00:21:43,039 --> 00:21:45,110
right
very violent you can go like viral app

1242
00:21:45,110 --> 00:21:45,120
very violent you can go like viral app
 

1243
00:21:45,120 --> 00:21:46,149
very violent you can go like viral app
that's horrible too

1244
00:21:46,149 --> 00:21:46,159
that's horrible too
 

1245
00:21:46,159 --> 00:21:50,230
that's horrible too
right it's some very uh inspiringly

1246
00:21:50,230 --> 00:21:50,240
right it's some very uh inspiringly
 

1247
00:21:50,240 --> 00:21:52,470
right it's some very uh inspiringly
impactful application how about that no

1248
00:21:52,470 --> 00:21:52,480
impactful application how about that no
 

1249
00:21:52,480 --> 00:21:54,549
impactful application how about that no
yeah okay so let's stick with killer app

1250
00:21:54,549 --> 00:21:54,559
yeah okay so let's stick with killer app
 

1251
00:21:54,559 --> 00:21:55,270
yeah okay so let's stick with killer app
that's fine

1252
00:21:55,270 --> 00:21:55,280
that's fine
 

1253
00:21:55,280 --> 00:21:58,310
that's fine
nobody's but i concur with you i dislike

1254
00:21:58,310 --> 00:21:58,320
nobody's but i concur with you i dislike
 

1255
00:21:58,320 --> 00:22:01,350
nobody's but i concur with you i dislike
the chosen words in in capturing the

1256

concept
 

1259
00:22:02,080 --> 00:22:03,750
concept
you know it's one of those sticky things

1260
00:22:03,750 --> 00:22:03,760
you know it's one of those sticky things
 

1261
00:22:03,760 --> 00:22:05,430
you know it's one of those sticky things
that uh is as

1262
00:22:05,430 --> 00:22:05,440
that uh is as
 

1263
00:22:05,440 --> 00:22:08,470
that uh is as
effective to use in the tech world but

1264
00:22:08,470 --> 00:22:08,480
effective to use in the tech world but
 

1265
00:22:08,480 --> 00:22:09,110
effective to use in the tech world but
when you

1266
00:22:09,110 --> 00:22:09,120
when you
 

1267
00:22:09,120 --> 00:22:11,990
when you
now become a communicator outside of the

1268
00:22:11,990 --> 00:22:12,000
now become a communicator outside of the
 

1269
00:22:12,000 --> 00:22:13,350
now become a communicator outside of the
tech world especially when you're

1270
00:22:13,350 --> 00:22:13,360
tech world especially when you're
 

1271
00:22:13,360 --> 00:22:15,590
tech world especially when you're
talking about software and hardware and

1272
00:22:15,590 --> 00:22:15,600
talking about software and hardware and
 

1273
00:22:15,600 --> 00:22:17,430
talking about software and hardware and
artificial intelligence applications it

1274
00:22:17,430 --> 00:22:17,440
artificial intelligence applications it
 

1275
00:22:17,440 --> 00:22:18,390
artificial intelligence applications it
sounds horrible you know it's

1276
00:22:18,390 --> 00:22:18,400
sounds horrible you know it's
 

1277
00:22:18,400 --> 00:22:19,029
sounds horrible you know it's
interesting i

1278
00:22:19,029 --> 00:22:19,039
interesting i
 

1279
00:22:19,039 --> 00:22:20,870
interesting i
i actually regret now having called

i actually regret now having called
 

1281
00:22:20,880 --> 00:22:22,549
i actually regret now having called
attention because i regret having used

1282

that word in this conversation
 

1285
00:22:24,080 --> 00:22:25,270
that word in this conversation
because it's something i would not

1286
00:22:25,270 --> 00:22:25,280
because it's something i would not
 

1287
00:22:25,280 --> 00:22:27,830
because it's something i would not
normally do i i used it

1288
00:22:27,830 --> 00:22:27,840
normally do i i used it
 

1289
00:22:27,840 --> 00:22:29,430
normally do i i used it
in order to create a bridge of shared

1290

yeah but yeah i concur let's go with the

1296
00:22:36,149 --> 00:22:36,159
yeah but yeah i concur let's go with the
 

1297
00:22:36,159 --> 00:22:39,990
yeah but yeah i concur let's go with the
impactful application value creation

1298
00:22:39,990 --> 00:22:40,000
impactful application value creation
 

1299
00:22:40,000 --> 00:22:42,310
impactful application value creation
value creation something people love

1300
00:22:42,310 --> 00:22:42,320
value creation something people love
 

1301
00:22:42,320 --> 00:22:43,430
value creation something people love
using

1302
00:22:43,430 --> 00:22:43,440
using
 

1303
00:22:43,440 --> 00:22:46,710
using
there we go that's it love app

1304
00:22:46,710 --> 00:22:46,720
there we go that's it love app
 

1305
00:22:46,720 --> 00:22:49,430
there we go that's it love app
okay so what uh do you have any ideas so

1306
00:22:49,430 --> 00:22:49,440
okay so what uh do you have any ideas so
 

1307
00:22:49,440 --> 00:22:50,870
okay so what uh do you have any ideas so
you're basically creating a framework

1308
00:22:50,870 --> 00:22:50,880
you're basically creating a framework
 

1309
00:22:50,880 --> 00:22:51,750
you're basically creating a framework
where there's

1310
00:22:51,750 --> 00:22:51,760
where there's
 

1311
00:22:51,760 --> 00:22:55,350
where there's
the possibility of a discovery of uh

1312
00:22:55,350 --> 00:22:55,360
the possibility of a discovery of uh
 

1313
00:22:55,360 --> 00:22:58,390
the possibility of a discovery of uh
an application that people love using

1314
00:22:58,390 --> 00:22:58,400
an application that people love using
 

1315
00:22:58,400 --> 00:23:00,390
an application that people love using
is do you have ideas we've began to play

1316
00:23:00,390 --> 00:23:00,400
is do you have ideas we've began to play
 

1317
00:23:00,400 --> 00:23:02,230
is do you have ideas we've began to play
a fun game internally where when we have

1318
00:23:02,230 --> 00:23:02,240
a fun game internally where when we have
 

1319
00:23:02,240 --> 00:23:03,510
a fun game internally where when we have
these discussions and we

1320
00:23:03,510 --> 00:23:03,520
these discussions and we
 

1321
00:23:03,520 --> 00:23:08,390
these discussions and we
begin circling around this concept of

1322
00:23:08,390 --> 00:23:08,400
begin circling around this concept of
 

1323
00:23:08,400 --> 00:23:10,470
begin circling around this concept of
does anybody have an idea does anyone

1324
00:23:10,470 --> 00:23:10,480
does anybody have an idea does anyone
 

1325
00:23:10,480 --> 00:23:11,830
does anybody have an idea does anyone
have intuitions and

1326
00:23:11,830 --> 00:23:11,840
have intuitions and
 

1327
00:23:11,840 --> 00:23:14,230
have intuitions and

00:26:04,640 --> 00:26:06,789
that reason
is it going to be people just kind of

is it going to be people just kind of
 

1493
00:26:06,799 --> 00:26:07,990
is it going to be people just kind of

that's just uh too exciting to

1500
00:26:15,990 --> 00:26:16,000
that's just uh too exciting to
 

1501
00:26:16,000 --> 00:26:19,269
that's just uh too exciting to
to not use if i think through the things

00:26:19,269 --> 00:26:19,279
to not use if i think through the things

that
 

1505
00:26:20,000 --> 00:26:22,390
that
have changed my life most significantly

1506
00:26:22,390 --> 00:26:22,400
have changed my life most significantly
 

1507
00:26:22,400 --> 00:26:23,430
have changed my life most significantly
over the past few years

1508
00:26:23,430 --> 00:26:23,440
over the past few years

wrist
 

1513
00:26:27,039 --> 00:26:28,710

that would give me data about my heart

1514
00:26:28,710 --> 00:26:28,720
that would give me data about my heart

1521
00:26:37,120 --> 00:26:38,870
metabolic approximations etc
for the first time in my life i had

1522
00:26:38,870 --> 00:26:38,880
for the first time in my life i had
 

1523
00:26:38,880 --> 00:26:40,149
for the first time in my life i had
access to information

1524
00:26:40,149 --> 00:26:40,159
access to information
 

1525
00:26:40,159 --> 00:26:42,470
access to information
uh sleep patterns that were highly

1526
00:26:42,470 --> 00:26:42,480
uh sleep patterns that were highly
 

1527
00:26:42,480 --> 00:26:43,269
uh sleep patterns that were highly
impactful

1528
00:26:43,269 --> 00:26:43,279
impactful
 

1529
00:26:43,279 --> 00:26:46,789
impactful
they they told me for example if i eat

1530
00:26:46,789 --> 00:26:46,799
they they told me for example if i eat
 

1531
00:26:46,799 --> 00:26:49,190
they they told me for example if i eat
close to bedtime i'm not going to get

1532
00:26:49,190 --> 00:26:49,200
close to bedtime i'm not going to get
 

1533
00:26:49,200 --> 00:26:50,789
close to bedtime i'm not going to get
deep sleep

1534
00:26:50,789 --> 00:26:50,799
deep sleep
 

1535
00:26:50,799 --> 00:26:52,549
deep sleep
and not getting deep sleep means you

1536
00:26:52,549 --> 00:26:52,559
and not getting deep sleep means you
 

1537
00:26:52,559 --> 00:26:54,070
and not getting deep sleep means you
have all these follow-on consequences in

1538
00:26:54,070 --> 00:26:54,080
have all these follow-on consequences in
 

1539
00:26:54,080 --> 00:26:55,190
have all these follow-on consequences in
life and so

1540
00:26:55,190 --> 00:26:55,200
life and so
 

1541
00:26:55,200 --> 00:26:57,269
life and so
it opened up this window of

1542
00:26:57,269 --> 00:26:57,279
it opened up this window of
 

1543
00:26:57,279 --> 00:26:59,350
it opened up this window of
understanding of myself

1544
00:26:59,350 --> 00:26:59,360
understanding of myself
 

1545
00:26:59,360 --> 00:27:02,630
understanding of myself
that i cannot self-introspect and deduce

1546
00:27:02,630 --> 00:27:02,640
that i cannot self-introspect and deduce
 

1547
00:27:02,640 --> 00:27:04,070
that i cannot self-introspect and deduce
these things this is information that

1548
00:27:04,070 --> 00:27:04,080
these things this is information that
 

1549
00:27:04,080 --> 00:27:04,390
these things this is information that
was

1550
00:27:04,390 --> 00:27:04,400
was
 

1551
00:27:04,400 --> 00:27:06,549
was
available to be acquired but it just

1552
00:27:06,549 --> 00:27:06,559
available to be acquired but it just
 

1553
00:27:06,559 --> 00:27:07,669
available to be acquired but it just
wasn't i would have to

1554
00:27:07,669 --> 00:27:07,679
wasn't i would have to
 

1555
00:27:07,679 --> 00:27:09,029
wasn't i would have to
get an expensive sleep study then it's

1556
00:27:09,029 --> 00:27:09,039
get an expensive sleep study then it's
 

1557
00:27:09,039 --> 00:27:10,789
get an expensive sleep study then it's
an end like one night and that's not

1558
00:27:10,789 --> 00:27:10,799
an end like one night and that's not
 

1559
00:27:10,799 --> 00:27:11,510
an end like one night and that's not
good enough to look

1560
00:27:11,510 --> 00:27:11,520
good enough to look
 

1561
00:27:11,520 --> 00:27:13,750
good enough to look
to run all my trials and so if you look

1562
00:27:13,750 --> 00:27:13,760
to run all my trials and so if you look
 

1563
00:27:13,760 --> 00:27:15,190
to run all my trials and so if you look
just at the information

1564
00:27:15,190 --> 00:27:15,200
just at the information
 

1565
00:27:15,200 --> 00:27:18,310
just at the information
that one can acquire on their wrist and

1566
00:27:18,310 --> 00:27:18,320
that one can acquire on their wrist and
 

1567
00:27:18,320 --> 00:27:19,350
that one can acquire on their wrist and
now you're applying planted to the

1568
00:27:19,350 --> 00:27:19,360
now you're applying planted to the
 

1569
00:27:19,360 --> 00:27:21,510
now you're applying planted to the
entire cortex on the brain

1570
00:27:21,510 --> 00:27:21,520
entire cortex on the brain
 

1571
00:27:21,520 --> 00:27:23,430
entire cortex on the brain
and you say what kind of information

1572
00:27:23,430 --> 00:27:23,440
and you say what kind of information
 

1573
00:27:23,440 --> 00:27:24,950
and you say what kind of information
could we acquire

1574
00:27:24,950 --> 00:27:24,960
could we acquire
 

1575
00:27:24,960 --> 00:27:27,430
could we acquire
it opens up a whole new universe of

1576
00:27:27,430 --> 00:27:27,440
it opens up a whole new universe of
 

1577
00:27:27,440 --> 00:27:28,230
it opens up a whole new universe of
possibilities

1578
00:27:28,230 --> 00:27:28,240
possibilities
 

1579
00:27:28,240 --> 00:27:29,669
possibilities
for example we did this internal study

1580
00:27:29,669 --> 00:27:29,679
for example we did this internal study
 

1581
00:27:29,679 --> 00:27:31,029
for example we did this internal study
at kernel where i wore a prototype

1582
00:27:31,029 --> 00:27:31,039
at kernel where i wore a prototype
 

1583
00:27:31,039 --> 00:27:32,470
at kernel where i wore a prototype
device

1584
00:27:32,470 --> 00:27:32,480
device
 

1585
00:27:32,480 --> 00:27:34,789
device
and we were measuring the cognitive

1586
00:27:34,789 --> 00:27:34,799
and we were measuring the cognitive
 

1587
00:27:34,799 --> 00:27:36,149
and we were measuring the cognitive
effects of sleep

1588
00:27:36,149 --> 00:27:36,159
effects of sleep
 

1589
00:27:36,159 --> 00:27:38,870
effects of sleep
so i had a device measuring my sleep i

1590
00:27:38,870 --> 00:27:38,880
so i had a device measuring my sleep i
 

1591
00:27:38,880 --> 00:27:40,470
so i had a device measuring my sleep i
performed with 13 of my

00:27:40,470 --> 00:27:40,480
performed with 13 of my
 

1593
00:27:40,480 --> 00:27:42,549
performed with 13 of my
my co-workers we performed four

1594
00:27:42,549 --> 00:27:42,559
my co-workers we performed four
 

1595
00:27:42,559 --> 00:27:44,310
my co-workers we performed four
cognitive tasks over

1596
00:27:44,310 --> 00:27:44,320
cognitive tasks over
 

1597
00:27:44,320 --> 00:27:46,950
cognitive tasks over
13 sessions and we focused on reaction

1598
00:27:46,950 --> 00:27:46,960
13 sessions and we focused on reaction
 

1599
00:27:46,960 --> 00:27:47,350
13 sessions and we focused on reaction

1602
00:27:50,870 --> 00:27:50,880
impulse control short-term memory
 

1603
00:27:50,880 --> 00:27:53,669
impulse control short-term memory
and then a resting state task and we

1604
00:27:53,669 --> 00:27:53,679
and then a resting state task and we
 

1605
00:27:53,679 --> 00:27:55,990
and then a resting state task and we
with mine we found for example that

1606
00:27:55,990 --> 00:27:56,000
with mine we found for example that
 

1607
00:27:56,000 --> 00:27:59,830
with mine we found for example that
my impulse control was independently

1608
00:27:59,830 --> 00:27:59,840
my impulse control was independently
 

1609
00:27:59,840 --> 00:28:01,110
my impulse control was independently
correlated with my sleep

1610
00:28:01,110 --> 00:28:01,120
correlated with my sleep
 

1611
00:28:01,120 --> 00:28:02,470
correlated with my sleep

00:28:04,720 --> 00:28:08,310
ability to play the game the point
of the study was i had the brain study i

1616
00:28:08,310 --> 00:28:08,320
of the study was i had the brain study i
 

1617
00:28:08,320 --> 00:28:09,510
of the study was i had the brain study i
did at colonel

1618
00:28:09,510 --> 00:28:09,520
did at colonel
 

1619
00:28:09,520 --> 00:28:14,310
did at colonel
confirmed my life experience that if i

1620
00:28:14,310 --> 00:28:14,320
confirmed my life experience that if i
 

1621
00:28:14,320 --> 00:28:17,909
confirmed my life experience that if i
my deep sleep determined whether or not

1622
00:28:17,909 --> 00:28:17,919
my deep sleep determined whether or not
 

1623
00:28:17,919 --> 00:28:19,350
my deep sleep determined whether or not
i would be able to resist

1624
00:28:19,350 --> 00:28:19,360
i would be able to resist
 

1625
00:28:19,360 --> 00:28:21,750
i would be able to resist
temptation the following day and my

1626
00:28:21,750 --> 00:28:21,760
temptation the following day and my
 

1627
00:28:21,760 --> 00:28:23,350
temptation the following day and my
brain didn't show that

1628
00:28:23,350 --> 00:28:23,360
brain didn't show that
 

1629
00:28:23,360 --> 00:28:25,269
brain didn't show that
as one example and so if you start

1630
00:28:25,269 --> 00:28:25,279
as one example and so if you start
 

1631
00:28:25,279 --> 00:28:26,789
as one example and so if you start
thinking if you actually have

1632
00:28:26,789 --> 00:28:26,799
thinking if you actually have
 

1633
00:28:26,799 --> 00:28:28,310
thinking if you actually have
uh data on yourself on your on your

1634
00:28:28,310 --> 00:28:28,320
uh data on yourself on your on your
 

1635
00:28:28,320 --> 00:28:30,070
uh data on yourself on your on your
entire cortex you can control the

1636
00:28:30,070 --> 00:28:30,080
entire cortex you can control the
 

1637
00:28:30,080 --> 00:28:34,630
entire cortex you can control the
settings i think there's probably an

1638
00:28:34,630 --> 00:28:34,640
settings i think there's probably an
 

1639
00:28:34,640 --> 00:28:36,870
settings i think there's probably an
uh a large number of things that we

1640
00:28:36,870 --> 00:28:36,880
uh a large number of things that we
 

1641
00:28:36,880 --> 00:28:37,990
uh a large number of things that we
could discover about ourselves

1642
00:28:37,990 --> 00:28:38,000
could discover about ourselves
 

1643
00:28:38,000 --> 00:28:39,990
could discover about ourselves
very very small and very very big i just

1644
00:28:39,990 --> 00:28:40,000
very very small and very very big i just
 

1645
00:28:40,000 --> 00:28:41,990
very very small and very very big i just
for example like when you read

1646
00:28:41,990 --> 00:28:42,000
for example like when you read
 

1647
00:28:42,000 --> 00:28:45,269
for example like when you read
news what's going on like when you use

1648
00:28:45,269 --> 00:28:45,279
news what's going on like when you use
 

1649
00:28:45,279 --> 00:28:47,590
news what's going on like when you use
social media when you use news what

1650
00:28:47,590 --> 00:28:47,600
social media when you use news what
 

1651
00:28:47,600 --> 00:28:50,149
social media when you use news what
like uh all the ways we allocate

1652
00:28:50,149 --> 00:28:50,159
like uh all the ways we allocate
 

1653
00:28:50,159 --> 00:28:51,190
like uh all the ways we allocate
attention

1654
00:28:51,190 --> 00:28:51,200
attention
 

1655
00:28:51,200 --> 00:28:52,870
attention
that's right with the computer i mean

1656
00:28:52,870 --> 00:28:52,880
that's right with the computer i mean
 

1657
00:28:52,880 --> 00:28:54,549
that's right with the computer i mean
that seems like a compelling place to

1658
00:28:54,549 --> 00:28:54,559
that seems like a compelling place to
 

1659
00:28:54,559 --> 00:28:55,350
that seems like a compelling place to
where you would

1660
00:28:55,350 --> 00:28:55,360
where you would
 

1661
00:28:55,360 --> 00:28:58,549
where you would
want to put on uh kernel by the way what

1662
00:28:58,549 --> 00:28:58,559
want to put on uh kernel by the way what
 

1663
00:28:58,559 --> 00:29:00,470
want to put on uh kernel by the way what
is it called kernel flux kernel like

1664
00:29:00,470 --> 00:29:00,480
is it called kernel flux kernel like
 

1665
00:29:00,480 --> 00:29:01,669
is it called kernel flux kernel like
what flow

1666
00:29:01,669 --> 00:29:01,679
what flow
 

1667
00:29:01,679 --> 00:29:04,710
what flow
fluid yeah two technologies uh flow flow

1668
00:29:04,710 --> 00:29:04,720
fluid yeah two technologies uh flow flow
 

1669
00:29:04,720 --> 00:29:07,269
fluid yeah two technologies uh flow flow
okay so when you when you put on the the

1670
00:29:07,269 --> 00:29:07,279
okay so when you when you put on the the
 

1671
00:29:07,279 --> 00:29:10,389
okay so when you when you put on the the
kernel flow

1672
00:29:10,389 --> 00:29:10,399

 

1673
00:29:10,399 --> 00:29:14,470

it it is seems like to be um

1674
00:29:14,470 --> 00:29:14,480
it it is seems like to be um
 

1675
00:29:14,480 --> 00:29:16,230
it it is seems like to be um
a compelling time and place to do it is

1676
00:29:16,230 --> 00:29:16,240
a compelling time and place to do it is
 

1677
00:29:16,240 --> 00:29:17,510
a compelling time and place to do it is
when you're behind a desk behind a

1678
00:29:17,510 --> 00:29:17,520
when you're behind a desk behind a
 

1679
00:29:17,520 --> 00:29:18,470
when you're behind a desk behind a
computer

because you could probably wear it for
 

1683
00:29:19,760 --> 00:29:21,590
because you could probably wear it for
prolonged periods of time

1684
00:29:21,590 --> 00:29:21,600
prolonged periods of time

that kind of coupling the information
 

1695
00:29:32,720 --> 00:29:34,549
that kind of coupling the information
about the human mind

with the consumption and the behaviors
 

1699
00:29:38,000 --> 00:29:40,149
with the consumption and the behaviors
in the digital world might give us a lot

1700
00:29:40,149 --> 00:29:40,159
in the digital world might give us a lot
 

1701
00:29:40,159 --> 00:29:41,990
in the digital world might give us a lot
of information about the effects

when there's a dead end about an idea
 

1757
00:30:40,880 --> 00:30:42,070
when there's a dead end about an idea
you have to kind of

1758
00:30:42,070 --> 00:30:42,080
you have to kind of
 

1759
00:30:42,080 --> 00:30:45,430
you have to kind of
calmly like walk back and start again

1760

calmly like walk back and start again
 

1761
00:30:45,440 --> 00:30:47,430
calmly like walk back and start again
all those kinds of processes it'd be

1762
00:30:47,430 --> 00:30:47,440
all those kinds of processes it'd be
 

1763
00:30:47,440 --> 00:30:49,669
all those kinds of processes it'd be
interesting to get data on what my mind

1764

interesting to get data on what my mind
 

1765

is actually doing
 

1767
00:30:50,960 --> 00:30:53,350
is actually doing
and also recently started doing uh i

1768

and also recently started doing uh i
 

1769
00:30:53,360 --> 00:30:54,230
and also recently started doing uh i
just talked to

just talked to
 

1771
00:30:54,240 --> 00:30:57,110
just talked to
sam harris a few days ago and been uh

1772

sam harris a few days ago and been uh
 

1773
00:30:57,120 --> 00:30:58,870
sam harris a few days ago and been uh
building up to that i started using

1774
00:30:58,870 --> 00:30:58,880
building up to that i started using
 

1775
00:30:58,880 --> 00:31:02,149
building up to that i started using
started meditating using his app waking

1776
00:31:02,149 --> 00:31:02,159
started meditating using his app waking
 

1777
00:31:02,159 --> 00:31:02,789
started meditating using his app waking
up but

1778
00:31:02,789 --> 00:31:02,799
up but
 

1779
00:31:02,799 --> 00:31:05,509
up but
very much uh recommend it it'd be

1780
00:31:05,509 --> 00:31:05,519
very much uh recommend it it'd be
 

1781
00:31:05,519 --> 00:31:07,350
very much uh recommend it it'd be
interesting to get data on that

1782
00:31:07,350 --> 00:31:07,360
interesting to get data on that
 

1783
00:31:07,360 --> 00:31:09,750
interesting to get data on that
because it's you're very it's like

1784
00:31:09,750 --> 00:31:09,760
because it's you're very it's like
 

1785
00:31:09,760 --> 00:31:11,350
because it's you're very it's like
you're removing all the noise

1786
00:31:11,350 --> 00:31:11,360
you're removing all the noise
 

1787
00:31:11,360 --> 00:31:13,750
you're removing all the noise
from your head and you're very much it's

1788
00:31:13,750 --> 00:31:13,760
from your head and you're very much it's
 

1789
00:31:13,760 --> 00:31:15,830
from your head and you're very much it's
an active process of

interesting that
 

1809
00:31:32,240 --> 00:31:34,710
interesting that
everyone who's designed an experience

1810

00:31:37,039 --> 00:31:39,190
app
or the deep work or with all the things

1816
00:31:39,190 --> 00:31:39,200
or the deep work or with all the things
 

1817
00:31:39,200 --> 00:31:40,389
or the deep work or with all the things
you mentioned

1818
00:31:40,389 --> 00:31:40,399
you mentioned
 

1819
00:31:40,399 --> 00:31:43,590
you mentioned
they constructed this product with a

1820
00:31:43,590 --> 00:31:43,600
they constructed this product with a
 

1821
00:31:43,600 --> 00:31:44,310
they constructed this product with a
certain

1822
00:31:44,310 --> 00:31:44,320
certain
 

1823
00:31:44,320 --> 00:31:47,990
certain
number of knowns yeah now what if

1824
00:31:47,990 --> 00:31:48,000
number of knowns yeah now what if
 

1825
00:31:48,000 --> 00:31:50,389
number of knowns yeah now what if
we expanded the number of knowns by 10x

1826
00:31:50,389 --> 00:31:50,399
we expanded the number of knowns by 10x
 

1827
00:31:50,399 --> 00:31:51,990
we expanded the number of knowns by 10x
or 20x or 30x

1828
00:31:51,990 --> 00:31:52,000
or 20x or 30x
 

1829
00:31:52,000 --> 00:31:54,070
or 20x or 30x
they would reconstruct their product

1830
00:31:54,070 --> 00:31:54,080
they would reconstruct their product
 

1831
00:31:54,080 --> 00:31:56,070
they would reconstruct their product
cool incorporate those known so it'd be

1832
00:31:56,070 --> 00:31:56,080
cool incorporate those known so it'd be
 

1833
00:31:56,080 --> 00:31:58,389
cool incorporate those known so it'd be
yeah and so this is the dimensionality

1834
00:31:58,389 --> 00:31:58,399
yeah and so this is the dimensionality
 

1835
00:31:58,399 --> 00:31:59,110
yeah and so this is the dimensionality
that i think is

1836
00:31:59,110 --> 00:31:59,120
that i think is
 

1837
00:31:59,120 --> 00:32:01,590
that i think is
the promising aspect is that people will

1838
00:32:01,590 --> 00:32:01,600
the promising aspect is that people will
 

1839
00:32:01,600 --> 00:32:03,029
the promising aspect is that people will
be able to

1840
00:32:03,029 --> 00:32:03,039
be able to
 

1841
00:32:03,039 --> 00:32:05,190
be able to
use this quantification use this

1842
00:32:05,190 --> 00:32:05,200
use this quantification use this
 

1843
00:32:05,200 --> 00:32:06,310
use this quantification use this
information

1844
00:32:06,310 --> 00:32:06,320
information
 

1845
00:32:06,320 --> 00:32:09,350
information
to build more effective products and

1846
00:32:09,350 --> 00:32:09,360
to build more effective products and
 

1847
00:32:09,360 --> 00:32:10,630
to build more effective products and
this is i'm not talking about

1848
00:32:10,630 --> 00:32:10,640
this is i'm not talking about
 

1849
00:32:10,640 --> 00:32:13,110
this is i'm not talking about
better products to advertise to you or

1850
00:32:13,110 --> 00:32:13,120
better products to advertise to you or
 

1851
00:32:13,120 --> 00:32:15,350
better products to advertise to you or
manipulate you i'm talking about uh

1852
00:32:15,350 --> 00:32:15,360
manipulate you i'm talking about uh
 

1853
00:32:15,360 --> 00:32:19,029
manipulate you i'm talking about uh
our focus is helping people individuals

1854
00:32:19,029 --> 00:32:19,039
our focus is helping people individuals
 

1855

have this contextual awareness and
quantification and then to engage with

1858
00:32:22,630 --> 00:32:22,640
quantification and then to engage with
 

1859
00:32:22,640 --> 00:32:24,149
quantification and then to engage with
others who are

1860
00:32:24,149 --> 00:32:24,159
others who are

seeking to improve people's lives that
 

1863
00:32:26,159 --> 00:32:29,110
seeking to improve people's lives that
the objective is

1864
00:32:29,110 --> 00:32:29,120
the objective is
 

1865
00:32:29,120 --> 00:32:31,430
the objective is
is betterment across ourselves

1866
00:32:31,430 --> 00:32:31,440
is betterment across ourselves
 

1867
00:32:31,440 --> 00:32:32,470
is betterment across ourselves
individually and also

1868
00:32:32,470 --> 00:32:32,480
individually and also
 

1869
00:32:32,480 --> 00:32:34,070
individually and also
uh with each other yeah so it's a nice

1870
00:32:34,070 --> 00:32:34,080
uh with each other yeah so it's a nice
 

1871
00:32:34,080 --> 00:32:35,430
uh with each other yeah so it's a nice
data stream to have if you're building

1872
00:32:35,430 --> 00:32:35,440
data stream to have if you're building
 

1873
00:32:35,440 --> 00:32:35,990
data stream to have if you're building
an app

1874
00:32:35,990 --> 00:32:36,000
an app
 

1875
00:32:36,000 --> 00:32:37,350
an app
like if you're building a podcast

1876
00:32:37,350 --> 00:32:37,360
like if you're building a podcast
 

1877
00:32:37,360 --> 00:32:38,789
like if you're building a podcast
listening app it would be nice to know

1878
00:32:38,789 --> 00:32:38,799
listening app it would be nice to know
 

1879
00:32:38,799 --> 00:32:40,230
listening app it would be nice to know
data about the listener

1880
00:32:40,230 --> 00:32:40,240
data about the listener
 

1881
00:32:40,240 --> 00:32:42,310
data about the listener
so that like if you're bored or you fell

1882
00:32:42,310 --> 00:32:42,320
so that like if you're bored or you fell
 

1883
00:32:42,320 --> 00:32:44,470
so that like if you're bored or you fell
asleep maybe pause the podcast

1884
00:32:44,470 --> 00:32:44,480
asleep maybe pause the podcast
 

1885
00:32:44,480 --> 00:32:47,110
asleep maybe pause the podcast
it's like really dumb just very simple

1886
00:32:47,110 --> 00:32:47,120
it's like really dumb just very simple
 

1887
00:32:47,120 --> 00:32:48,230
it's like really dumb just very simple
applications

1888
00:32:48,230 --> 00:32:48,240
applications
 

1889
00:32:48,240 --> 00:32:49,750
applications
that could just improve the quality of

1890
00:32:49,750 --> 00:32:49,760
that could just improve the quality of
 

1891
00:32:49,760 --> 00:32:51,830
that could just improve the quality of
the experience of the using the app

1892
00:32:51,830 --> 00:32:51,840
the experience of the using the app
 

1893
00:32:51,840 --> 00:32:55,110
the experience of the using the app
and imagining if you have you have your

1894
00:32:55,110 --> 00:32:55,120
and imagining if you have you have your
 

1895
00:32:55,120 --> 00:32:56,630
and imagining if you have you have your
neuron this is lex

1896
00:32:56,630 --> 00:32:56,640
neuron this is lex
 

1897
00:32:56,640 --> 00:32:58,789
neuron this is lex
and you there's a statistical

1898
00:32:58,789 --> 00:32:58,799
and you there's a statistical
 

1899
00:32:58,799 --> 00:32:59,830
and you there's a statistical
representation of you

1900
00:32:59,830 --> 00:32:59,840
representation of you
 

1901
00:32:59,840 --> 00:33:02,549
representation of you
and you engage with the app and it says

1902
00:33:02,549 --> 00:33:02,559
and you engage with the app and it says
 

1903
00:33:02,559 --> 00:33:03,909
and you engage with the app and it says
lex

1904
00:33:03,909 --> 00:33:03,919
lex
 

1905
00:33:03,919 --> 00:33:08,549
lex
your best to engage with this meditation

1906
00:33:08,549 --> 00:33:08,559

 

1907
00:33:08,559 --> 00:33:11,190

exercise in the following settings at

1908
00:33:11,190 --> 00:33:11,200
exercise in the following settings at
 

1909
00:33:11,200 --> 00:33:12,230
exercise in the following settings at
this time of day

1910
00:33:12,230 --> 00:33:12,240
this time of day
 

1911
00:33:12,240 --> 00:33:14,230
this time of day
after eating this kind of food or not

1912
00:33:14,230 --> 00:33:14,240
after eating this kind of food or not
 

1913
00:33:14,240 --> 00:33:15,350
after eating this kind of food or not
eaten fasting

1914
00:33:15,350 --> 00:33:15,360
eaten fasting
 

1915
00:33:15,360 --> 00:33:17,590
eaten fasting
with this level of blood glucose and

1916
00:33:17,590 --> 00:33:17,600
with this level of blood glucose and
 

1917
00:33:17,600 --> 00:33:19,590
with this level of blood glucose and
this kind of night's sleep

1918
00:33:19,590 --> 00:33:19,600
this kind of night's sleep
 

1919
00:33:19,600 --> 00:33:22,870
this kind of night's sleep
but all these data combined

1920
00:33:22,870 --> 00:33:22,880
but all these data combined
 

1921
00:33:22,880 --> 00:33:26,070
but all these data combined
to give you this contextually relevant

1922
00:33:26,070 --> 00:33:26,080
to give you this contextually relevant
 

1923
00:33:26,080 --> 00:33:27,190
to give you this contextually relevant
experience just like we do with our

1924
00:33:27,190 --> 00:33:27,200
experience just like we do with our
 

1925
00:33:27,200 --> 00:33:29,350
experience just like we do with our
sleep we you've optimized your entire

1926
00:33:29,350 --> 00:33:29,360
sleep we you've optimized your entire
 

1927
00:33:29,360 --> 00:33:29,750
sleep we you've optimized your entire
life

1928
00:33:29,750 --> 00:33:29,760
life
 

1929
00:33:29,760 --> 00:33:31,110
life
based upon what information you can

1930
00:33:31,110 --> 00:33:31,120
based upon what information you can
 

1931
00:33:31,120 --> 00:33:34,070
based upon what information you can
acquire and know about yourself

1932
00:33:34,070 --> 00:33:34,080
acquire and know about yourself
 

1933
00:33:34,080 --> 00:33:35,990
acquire and know about yourself
and so the question is how much do we

1934
00:33:35,990 --> 00:33:36,000
and so the question is how much do we
 

1935
00:33:36,000 --> 00:33:37,110
and so the question is how much do we
really know

1936
00:33:37,110 --> 00:33:37,120
really know
 

1937
00:33:37,120 --> 00:33:38,630
really know
of the things going around us and i

1938
00:33:38,630 --> 00:33:38,640
of the things going around us and i
 

1939
00:33:38,640 --> 00:33:40,310
of the things going around us and i
would venture to guess in my own my life

1940
00:33:40,310 --> 00:33:40,320
would venture to guess in my own my life
 

1941
00:33:40,320 --> 00:33:41,430
would venture to guess in my own my life
life experience

1942
00:33:41,430 --> 00:33:41,440
life experience
 

1943
00:33:41,440 --> 00:33:43,590
life experience
i capture my self-awareness captures an

1944
00:33:43,590 --> 00:33:43,600
i capture my self-awareness captures an
 

1945
00:33:43,600 --> 00:33:45,830
i capture my self-awareness captures an
extremely small

1946
00:33:45,830 --> 00:33:45,840
extremely small
 

1947
00:33:45,840 --> 00:33:47,350
extremely small
percent of the things that actually

1948
00:33:47,350 --> 00:33:47,360
percent of the things that actually
 

1949
00:33:47,360 --> 00:33:49,190
percent of the things that actually
influence my conscious

1950
00:33:49,190 --> 00:33:49,200
influence my conscious
 

1951
00:33:49,200 --> 00:33:51,029
influence my conscious
and unconscious experience well in some

1952
00:33:51,029 --> 00:33:51,039
and unconscious experience well in some
 

1953
00:33:51,039 --> 00:33:52,549
and unconscious experience well in some
sense the data would

1954
00:33:52,549 --> 00:33:52,559
sense the data would
 

1955
00:33:52,559 --> 00:33:55,669
sense the data would
help encourage you to be more self-aware

1956
00:33:55,669 --> 00:33:55,679
help encourage you to be more self-aware
 

1957
00:33:55,679 --> 00:33:56,789
help encourage you to be more self-aware
not just because you

1958
00:33:56,789 --> 00:33:56,799
not just because you
 

1959
00:33:56,799 --> 00:34:00,789
not just because you
trust everything the data is saying but

1960
00:34:00,789 --> 00:34:00,799
trust everything the data is saying but
 

1961
00:34:00,799 --> 00:34:03,350
trust everything the data is saying but
is it'll give you a prod to start

1962
00:34:03,350 --> 00:34:03,360
is it'll give you a prod to start
 

1963
00:34:03,360 --> 00:34:04,630
is it'll give you a prod to start
investigating

1964
00:34:04,630 --> 00:34:04,640
investigating
 

1965
00:34:04,640 --> 00:34:07,909
investigating
like i would love to get like a a rating

1966
00:34:07,909 --> 00:34:07,919
like i would love to get like a a rating
 

1967
00:34:07,919 --> 00:34:11,109
like i would love to get like a a rating
like a ranking of all the things i do

1968
00:34:11,109 --> 00:34:11,119
like a ranking of all the things i do
 

1969
00:34:11,119 --> 00:34:12,710
like a ranking of all the things i do
and what are the things this is probably

1970
00:34:12,710 --> 00:34:12,720
and what are the things this is probably
 

1971
00:34:12,720 --> 00:34:15,109
and what are the things this is probably
important to do without the data but the

1972
00:34:15,109 --> 00:34:15,119
important to do without the data but the
 

1973
00:34:15,119 --> 00:34:16,950
important to do without the data but the
data will certainly help it's like

1974
00:34:16,950 --> 00:34:16,960
data will certainly help it's like
 

1975
00:34:16,960 --> 00:34:20,149
data will certainly help it's like
rank all the things you do in life and

1976
00:34:20,149 --> 00:34:20,159
rank all the things you do in life and
 

1977
00:34:20,159 --> 00:34:21,909
rank all the things you do in life and

you're suggesting that i could

2136
00:37:05,190 --> 00:37:05,200
you're suggesting that i could
 

2137
00:37:05,200 --> 00:37:07,670
you're suggesting that i could
not be aware of they might be sitting

2138
00:37:07,670 --> 00:37:07,680
not be aware of they might be sitting
 

2139
00:37:07,680 --> 00:37:09,030
not be aware of they might be sitting
right in front of me

2140
00:37:09,030 --> 00:37:09,040
right in front of me
 

2141
00:37:09,040 --> 00:37:10,630
right in front of me
that uh make me feel really good and

2142
00:37:10,630 --> 00:37:10,640
that uh make me feel really good and
 

2143
00:37:10,640 --> 00:37:12,069
that uh make me feel really good and
make me feel not good

2144
00:37:12,069 --> 00:37:12,079
make me feel not good
 

2145
00:37:12,079 --> 00:37:14,230
make me feel not good
and the data would show that i agree

2146
00:37:14,230 --> 00:37:14,240
and the data would show that i agree
 

2147
00:37:14,240 --> 00:37:16,069
and the data would show that i agree
with you i've actually

2148
00:37:16,069 --> 00:37:16,079
with you i've actually
 

2149
00:37:16,079 --> 00:37:18,630
with you i've actually
employed the same strategy i i fired my

2150
00:37:18,630 --> 00:37:18,640
employed the same strategy i i fired my
 

2151
00:37:18,640 --> 00:37:20,150
employed the same strategy i i fired my
mind entirely

2152
00:37:20,150 --> 00:37:20,160
mind entirely
 

2153
00:37:20,160 --> 00:37:22,390
mind entirely
from being responsible for constructing

2154
00:37:22,390 --> 00:37:22,400
from being responsible for constructing
 

2155
00:37:22,400 --> 00:37:23,190
from being responsible for constructing
my diet

2156
00:37:23,190 --> 00:37:23,200
my diet
 

2157
00:37:23,200 --> 00:37:25,030
my diet
so i started doing a program where i now

2158
00:37:25,030 --> 00:37:25,040
so i started doing a program where i now
 

2159
00:37:25,040 --> 00:37:27,190
so i started doing a program where i now
track over 200 biomarkers

2160
00:37:27,190 --> 00:37:27,200
track over 200 biomarkers
 

2161
00:37:27,200 --> 00:37:30,230
track over 200 biomarkers
every 90 days and it captures

2162
00:37:30,230 --> 00:37:30,240
every 90 days and it captures
 

2163
00:37:30,240 --> 00:37:31,670
every 90 days and it captures
of course the things you would expect

2164
00:37:31,670 --> 00:37:31,680
of course the things you would expect
 

2165
00:37:31,680 --> 00:37:33,510
of course the things you would expect
like cholesterol but also dna

2166
00:37:33,510 --> 00:37:33,520
like cholesterol but also dna
 

2167
00:37:33,520 --> 00:37:34,390
like cholesterol but also dna
methylation

2168
00:37:34,390 --> 00:37:34,400
methylation
 

2169
00:37:34,400 --> 00:37:36,790
methylation
and all kinds of things that about my

2170
00:37:36,790 --> 00:37:36,800
and all kinds of things that about my
 

2171
00:37:36,800 --> 00:37:38,390
and all kinds of things that about my
body all the processes that make up

2172
00:37:38,390 --> 00:37:38,400
body all the processes that make up
 

2173
00:37:38,400 --> 00:37:41,190
body all the processes that make up
me and then i let that data generate the

2174
00:37:41,190 --> 00:37:41,200
me and then i let that data generate the
 

2175
00:37:41,200 --> 00:37:43,109
me and then i let that data generate the
shopping list

2176
00:37:43,109 --> 00:37:43,119
shopping list
 

2177
00:37:43,119 --> 00:37:44,950
shopping list
and so i never actually ask my mind what

2178
00:37:44,950 --> 00:37:44,960
and so i never actually ask my mind what
 

2179
00:37:44,960 --> 00:37:47,030
and so i never actually ask my mind what
it wants it's entirely what my body

2180
00:37:47,030 --> 00:37:47,040
it wants it's entirely what my body
 

2181
00:37:47,040 --> 00:37:48,790
it wants it's entirely what my body
is reporting that it wants and so i call

2182
00:37:48,790 --> 00:37:48,800
is reporting that it wants and so i call
 

2183
00:37:48,800 --> 00:37:50,390
is reporting that it wants and so i call
this goal alignment

2184
00:37:50,390 --> 00:37:50,400
this goal alignment
 

2185
00:37:50,400 --> 00:37:53,349
this goal alignment
within brian and there's 200 plus actors

2186
00:37:53,349 --> 00:37:53,359
within brian and there's 200 plus actors
 

2187
00:37:53,359 --> 00:37:54,710
within brian and there's 200 plus actors
that i'm currently asking their opinion

2188
00:37:54,710 --> 00:37:54,720
that i'm currently asking their opinion
 

2189
00:37:54,720 --> 00:37:55,109
that i'm currently asking their opinion
of

2190
00:37:55,109 --> 00:37:55,119
of
 

2191
00:37:55,119 --> 00:37:56,870
of
and so i'm asking my liver how are you

2192
00:37:56,870 --> 00:37:56,880
and so i'm asking my liver how are you
 

2193
00:37:56,880 --> 00:37:58,790
and so i'm asking my liver how are you
doing and it's expressing

2194
00:37:58,790 --> 00:37:58,800
doing and it's expressing
 

2195
00:37:58,800 --> 00:38:00,470
doing and it's expressing
via the biomarkers and so then i

2196
00:38:00,470 --> 00:38:00,480
via the biomarkers and so then i
 

2197
00:38:00,480 --> 00:38:02,150
via the biomarkers and so then i
construct that diet

2198
00:38:02,150 --> 00:38:02,160
construct that diet
 

2199
00:38:02,160 --> 00:38:04,870
construct that diet
and i only eat those foods until my next

2200
00:38:04,870 --> 00:38:04,880
and i only eat those foods until my next
 

2201
00:38:04,880 --> 00:38:06,150
and i only eat those foods until my next
testing round

2202
00:38:06,150 --> 00:38:06,160
testing round
 

2203
00:38:06,160 --> 00:38:09,750
testing round
and that has changed my life more than i

2204
00:38:09,750 --> 00:38:09,760
and that has changed my life more than i
 

2205
00:38:09,760 --> 00:38:10,790
and that has changed my life more than i
think anything else

2206
00:38:10,790 --> 00:38:10,800
think anything else
 

2207
00:38:10,800 --> 00:38:14,870
think anything else
because in the emotion of my conscious

2208
00:38:14,870 --> 00:38:14,880
because in the emotion of my conscious
 

2209
00:38:14,880 --> 00:38:17,510
because in the emotion of my conscious
mind that i gave primacy to my entire

2210
00:38:17,510 --> 00:38:17,520
mind that i gave primacy to my entire
 

2211
00:38:17,520 --> 00:38:19,270
mind that i gave primacy to my entire
life it led me astray because like you

2212
00:38:19,270 --> 00:38:19,280
life it led me astray because like you
 

2213
00:38:19,280 --> 00:38:20,390
life it led me astray because like you
were saying

2214
00:38:20,390 --> 00:38:20,400
were saying
 

2215
00:38:20,400 --> 00:38:22,390
were saying
the mind then goes out into the world

2216
00:38:22,390 --> 00:38:22,400
the mind then goes out into the world
 

2217
00:38:22,400 --> 00:38:25,030
the mind then goes out into the world
and it navigates

2218
00:38:25,030 --> 00:38:25,040
and it navigates
 

2219
00:38:25,040 --> 00:38:27,910
and it navigates
the dozens of different dietary regimens

2220
00:38:27,910 --> 00:38:27,920
the dozens of different dietary regimens
 

2221
00:38:27,920 --> 00:38:29,349
the dozens of different dietary regimens
people put together in books and it all

2222
00:38:29,349 --> 00:38:29,359
people put together in books and it all
 

2223
00:38:29,359 --> 00:38:31,349
people put together in books and it all
has

2224
00:38:31,349 --> 00:38:31,359
has
 

2225
00:38:31,359 --> 00:38:32,710
has
al their their supporting science in

2226
00:38:32,710 --> 00:38:32,720
al their their supporting science in
 

2227
00:38:32,720 --> 00:38:34,470
al their their supporting science in
certain contextual settings but it's not

2228
00:38:34,470 --> 00:38:34,480
certain contextual settings but it's not
 

2229
00:38:34,480 --> 00:38:35,510
certain contextual settings but it's not
n of one

2230
00:38:35,510 --> 00:38:35,520
n of one
 

2231
00:38:35,520 --> 00:38:37,349
n of one
and like you're saying this dietary

2232
00:38:37,349 --> 00:38:37,359
and like you're saying this dietary
 

2233
00:38:37,359 --> 00:38:38,870
and like you're saying this dietary
really is an end of one

2234
00:38:38,870 --> 00:38:38,880
really is an end of one
 

2235
00:38:38,880 --> 00:38:40,790
really is an end of one
these what people have published

2236
00:38:40,790 --> 00:38:40,800
these what people have published
 

2237
00:38:40,800 --> 00:38:44,150
these what people have published
scientifically of course can be used

2238
00:38:44,150 --> 00:38:44,160
scientifically of course can be used
 

2239
00:38:44,160 --> 00:38:47,430
scientifically of course can be used
for nice groundings but it changes when

2240
00:38:47,430 --> 00:38:47,440
for nice groundings but it changes when
 

2241
00:38:47,440 --> 00:38:48,470
for nice groundings but it changes when
you get to the end of one level

2242
00:38:48,470 --> 00:38:48,480
you get to the end of one level
 

2243
00:38:48,480 --> 00:38:50,790
you get to the end of one level
and so that's what gets me excited about

2244
00:38:50,790 --> 00:38:50,800
and so that's what gets me excited about
 

2245
00:38:50,800 --> 00:38:52,550
and so that's what gets me excited about
brainerd faces is if you

2246
00:38:52,550 --> 00:38:52,560
brainerd faces is if you
 

2247
00:38:52,560 --> 00:38:53,910
brainerd faces is if you
if i could do the same thing for my

2248
00:38:53,910 --> 00:38:53,920
if i could do the same thing for my
 

2249
00:38:53,920 --> 00:38:55,829
if i could do the same thing for my
brain where i can stop asking my

2250
00:38:55,829 --> 00:38:55,839
brain where i can stop asking my
 

2251
00:38:55,839 --> 00:38:56,790
brain where i can stop asking my
conscious mind

2252
00:38:56,790 --> 00:38:56,800

00:39:00,790 --> 00:39:00,800
making which is
 

2257
00:39:00,800 --> 00:39:02,390
making which is
flawed and i'd rather just look at this

2258
00:39:02,390 --> 00:39:02,400
flawed and i'd rather just look at this
 

2259
00:39:02,400 --> 00:39:04,630
flawed and i'd rather just look at this
data that and i've i've never had better

2260
00:39:04,630 --> 00:39:04,640
data that and i've i've never had better
 

2261
00:39:04,640 --> 00:39:05,990
data that and i've i've never had better
health markers in my life than when i

2262
00:39:05,990 --> 00:39:06,000
health markers in my life than when i
 

2263
00:39:06,000 --> 00:39:06,390
health markers in my life than when i
stopped

2264
00:39:06,390 --> 00:39:06,400
stopped
 

2265
00:39:06,400 --> 00:39:08,390
stopped
actually asking myself to be in charge

2266
00:39:08,390 --> 00:39:08,400
actually asking myself to be in charge
 

2267
00:39:08,400 --> 00:39:09,510
actually asking myself to be in charge
of it and

2268
00:39:09,510 --> 00:39:09,520
of it and
 

2269
00:39:09,520 --> 00:39:12,630
of it and
the idea of uh the motion of the

2270
00:39:12,630 --> 00:39:12,640
the idea of uh the motion of the
 

2271
00:39:12,640 --> 00:39:14,950
the idea of uh the motion of the
conscious mind

2272

conscious mind
 

2273
00:39:14,960 --> 00:39:18,310
conscious mind
is uh is such a sort of engineering way

2274
00:39:18,310 --> 00:39:18,320
is uh is such a sort of engineering way
 

2275
00:39:18,320 --> 00:39:21,109
is uh is such a sort of engineering way
of phrasing like meditation with

00:39:21,109 --> 00:39:21,119
of phrasing like meditation with
 

2277
00:39:21,119 --> 00:39:22,150
of phrasing like meditation with
what they mean that's what we're doing

2278
00:39:22,150 --> 00:39:22,160
what they mean that's what we're doing
 

2279
00:39:22,160 --> 00:39:23,990
what they mean that's what we're doing
right yeah that's beautiful that means

2280
00:39:23,990 --> 00:39:24,000
right yeah that's beautiful that means
 

2281
00:39:24,000 --> 00:39:25,990
right yeah that's beautiful that means
really beautifully put

00:39:25,990 --> 00:39:26,000
really beautifully put
 

2283
00:39:26,000 --> 00:39:28,069
really beautifully put
by the way testing around what does that

2284
00:39:28,069 --> 00:39:28,079
by the way testing around what does that
 

2285
00:39:28,079 --> 00:39:29,750
by the way testing around what does that
look like what's that

2286
00:39:29,750 --> 00:39:29,760
look like what's that
 

2287
00:39:29,760 --> 00:39:32,470
look like what's that
well you mentioned uh yeah the very the

2288
00:39:32,470 --> 00:39:32,480
well you mentioned uh yeah the very the
 

2289
00:39:32,480 --> 00:39:33,190
well you mentioned uh yeah the very the
test i do

2290
00:39:33,190 --> 00:39:33,200
test i do
 

2291
00:39:33,200 --> 00:39:36,230
test i do
yes so includes a complete

yes so includes a complete
 

2293
00:39:36,240 --> 00:39:39,430
yes so includes a complete

induced inflammation so i look for

2298
00:39:43,990 --> 00:39:44,000
induced inflammation so i look for
 

2299
00:39:44,000 --> 00:39:45,990
induced inflammation so i look for
excited kind expressions so foods that

2300
00:39:45,990 --> 00:39:46,000
excited kind expressions so foods that
 

2301
00:39:46,000 --> 00:39:48,470
excited kind expressions so foods that
produce inflammatory reactions

2302
00:39:48,470 --> 00:39:48,480
produce inflammatory reactions
 

2303
00:39:48,480 --> 00:39:50,069
produce inflammatory reactions
i look at my neural endocrine systems i

2304
00:39:50,069 --> 00:39:50,079
i look at my neural endocrine systems i
 

2305
00:39:50,079 --> 00:39:54,150
i look at my neural endocrine systems i
look at all my neural transmitters

2306
00:39:54,150 --> 00:39:54,160

 

2307
00:39:54,160 --> 00:39:57,109

i do yeah there's several micronutrient

2308
00:39:57,109 --> 00:39:57,119
i do yeah there's several micronutrient
 

2309
00:39:57,119 --> 00:39:58,470
i do yeah there's several micronutrient
tests to see how i'm looking at the very

2310
00:39:58,470 --> 00:39:58,480
tests to see how i'm looking at the very
 

2311
00:39:58,480 --> 00:39:59,349
tests to see how i'm looking at the very
various nutrients

2312
00:39:59,349 --> 00:39:59,359
various nutrients
 

2313
00:39:59,359 --> 00:40:02,630
various nutrients
what about like self report of

2314
00:40:02,630 --> 00:40:02,640
what about like self report of
 

2315
00:40:02,640 --> 00:40:05,030
what about like self report of
like how you feel you know almost like

2316
00:40:05,030 --> 00:40:05,040
like how you feel you know almost like
 

2317
00:40:05,040 --> 00:40:07,750
like how you feel you know almost like
um

2318
00:40:07,750 --> 00:40:07,760

 

2319
00:40:07,760 --> 00:40:09,589

you can't demote your con you still

2320
00:40:09,589 --> 00:40:09,599
you can't demote your con you still
 

2321
00:40:09,599 --> 00:40:12,069
you can't demote your con you still
exist within your conscious mind

2322
00:40:12,069 --> 00:40:12,079
exist within your conscious mind
 

2323
00:40:12,079 --> 00:40:15,190
exist within your conscious mind
right so that lived experience of is of

2324
00:40:15,190 --> 00:40:15,200
right so that lived experience of is of
 

2325
00:40:15,200 --> 00:40:17,109
right so that lived experience of is of
a lot of value so how do you measure

2326
00:40:17,109 --> 00:40:17,119
a lot of value so how do you measure
 

2327
00:40:17,119 --> 00:40:19,589
a lot of value so how do you measure
that i do a temporal sampling

2328
00:40:19,589 --> 00:40:19,599
that i do a temporal sampling
 

2329
00:40:19,599 --> 00:40:21,430
that i do a temporal sampling
over some duration of time so i'll think

2330
00:40:21,430 --> 00:40:21,440
over some duration of time so i'll think
 

2331
00:40:21,440 --> 00:40:22,710
over some duration of time so i'll think
through how i feel

2332
00:40:22,710 --> 00:40:22,720
through how i feel
 

2333
00:40:22,720 --> 00:40:24,790
through how i feel
over a week over a month over three

2334
00:40:24,790 --> 00:40:24,800
over a week over a month over three
 

2335
00:40:24,800 --> 00:40:27,430
over a week over a month over three
months i don't do a temporal sampling of

2336
00:40:27,430 --> 00:40:27,440
months i don't do a temporal sampling of
 

2337
00:40:27,440 --> 00:40:28,870
months i don't do a temporal sampling of
if i'm at the grocery store in front of

2338
00:40:28,870 --> 00:40:28,880
if i'm at the grocery store in front of
 

2339
00:40:28,880 --> 00:40:30,309
if i'm at the grocery store in front of
a cereal box and be like

2340
00:40:30,309 --> 00:40:30,319
a cereal box and be like
 

2341
00:40:30,319 --> 00:40:32,150
a cereal box and be like
you know what captain crunch is probably

2342
00:40:32,150 --> 00:40:32,160
you know what captain crunch is probably
 

2343
00:40:32,160 --> 00:40:33,430
you know what captain crunch is probably
the right thing for me today because i'm

2344
00:40:33,430 --> 00:40:33,440
the right thing for me today because i'm
 

2345
00:40:33,440 --> 00:40:34,309
the right thing for me today because i'm
feeling like

2346
00:40:34,309 --> 00:40:34,319
feeling like
 

2347
00:40:34,319 --> 00:40:36,470
feeling like
i need a little fun in my life yeah and

2348
00:40:36,470 --> 00:40:36,480
i need a little fun in my life yeah and
 

2349
00:40:36,480 --> 00:40:38,069
i need a little fun in my life yeah and
so it's a temporal sampling if the data

2350
00:40:38,069 --> 00:40:38,079
so it's a temporal sampling if the data
 

2351
00:40:38,079 --> 00:40:39,910
so it's a temporal sampling if the data
set's large enough then i i smooth out

2352
00:40:39,910 --> 00:40:39,920
set's large enough then i i smooth out
 

2353
00:40:39,920 --> 00:40:42,069
set's large enough then i i smooth out
the function of my natural oscillations

2354
00:40:42,069 --> 00:40:42,079
the function of my natural oscillations
 

2355
00:40:42,079 --> 00:40:43,670
the function of my natural oscillations
of how i feel about life where some days

2356
00:40:43,670 --> 00:40:43,680
of how i feel about life where some days
 

2357
00:40:43,680 --> 00:40:44,309
of how i feel about life where some days
i may

2358
00:40:44,309 --> 00:40:44,319
i may
 

2359
00:40:44,319 --> 00:40:46,550
i may
feel upset or depressed or down or

2360
00:40:46,550 --> 00:40:46,560
feel upset or depressed or down or
 

2361
00:40:46,560 --> 00:40:48,790
feel upset or depressed or down or
whatever and i don't want those moments

2362
00:40:48,790 --> 00:40:48,800
whatever and i don't want those moments
 

2363
00:40:48,800 --> 00:40:50,550
whatever and i don't want those moments
to then rule my decision making that's

2364
00:40:50,550 --> 00:40:50,560
to then rule my decision making that's
 

2365
00:40:50,560 --> 00:40:51,190
to then rule my decision making that's
why

2366
00:40:51,190 --> 00:40:51,200
why
 

2367
00:40:51,200 --> 00:40:53,109
why
the demotion happens and it says really

2368
00:40:53,109 --> 00:40:53,119
the demotion happens and it says really
 

2369
00:40:53,119 --> 00:40:55,030
the demotion happens and it says really
if you're looking at health over 90 day

2370
00:40:55,030 --> 00:40:55,040
if you're looking at health over 90 day
 

2371
00:40:55,040 --> 00:40:56,470
if you're looking at health over 90 day
period of time

2372
00:40:56,470 --> 00:40:56,480
period of time
 

2373
00:40:56,480 --> 00:40:59,510
period of time
all my 200 voices speak up on that

2374
00:40:59,510 --> 00:40:59,520
all my 200 voices speak up on that
 

2375
00:40:59,520 --> 00:40:59,990
all my 200 voices speak up on that
interval

2376
00:40:59,990 --> 00:41:00,000
interval
 

2377
00:41:00,000 --> 00:41:02,390
interval
and they're all given voice to say this

2378
00:41:02,390 --> 00:41:02,400
and they're all given voice to say this
 

2379
00:41:02,400 --> 00:41:04,470
and they're all given voice to say this
is how i'm doing and this is what i want

2380
00:41:04,470 --> 00:41:04,480
is how i'm doing and this is what i want
 

2381
00:41:04,480 --> 00:41:06,150
is how i'm doing and this is what i want
and so it really is an accounting system

2382
00:41:06,150 --> 00:41:06,160
and so it really is an accounting system
 

2383
00:41:06,160 --> 00:41:08,150
and so it really is an accounting system
for everybody so that's why

2384
00:41:08,150 --> 00:41:08,160
for everybody so that's why
 

2385
00:41:08,160 --> 00:41:10,309
for everybody so that's why
i think that if you think about the

2386
00:41:10,309 --> 00:41:10,319
i think that if you think about the
 

2387
00:41:10,319 --> 00:41:13,670
i think that if you think about the
future of being human

2388
00:41:13,670 --> 00:41:13,680

 

2389
00:41:13,680 --> 00:41:16,150

there's two things i think that are

2390
00:41:16,150 --> 00:41:16,160
there's two things i think that are
 

2391
00:41:16,160 --> 00:41:17,829
there's two things i think that are
really going on

2392
00:41:17,829 --> 00:41:17,839
really going on
 

2393
00:41:17,839 --> 00:41:19,990
really going on
one is the design manufacturing and

2394
00:41:19,990 --> 00:41:20,000
one is the design manufacturing and
 

2395
00:41:20,000 --> 00:41:22,870
one is the design manufacturing and
distribution of intelligence

2396

2397
00:41:22,880 --> 00:41:26,630
distribution of intelligence
is heading towards zero con a cost curve

2398
00:41:26,630 --> 00:41:26,640
is heading towards zero con a cost curve
 

2399
00:41:26,640 --> 00:41:28,550
is heading towards zero con a cost curve
over over a certain design over a

produced us
 

2407
00:41:33,040 --> 00:41:35,670
produced us
an intelligent form of intelligence we

2408
00:41:35,670 --> 00:41:35,680
an intelligent form of intelligence we
 

2409
00:41:35,680 --> 00:41:37,109
an intelligent form of intelligence we
are now designing our own intelligence

just give me a second okay that's

2430
00:41:52,630 --> 00:41:52,640
just give me a second okay that's
 

2431
00:41:52,640 --> 00:41:54,390
just give me a second okay that's
brilliant okay

2432
00:41:54,390 --> 00:41:54,400
brilliant okay
 

2433
00:41:54,400 --> 00:41:57,510
brilliant okay
and evolution is doing the design

2434
00:41:57,510 --> 00:41:57,520
and evolution is doing the design
 

2435
00:41:57,520 --> 00:41:58,950
and evolution is doing the design
manufacturing distribution of

00:41:58,950 --> 00:41:58,960
manufacturing distribution of
 

2437
00:41:58,960 --> 00:42:01,030
manufacturing distribution of
intelligence and now we are doing

2438
00:42:01,030 --> 00:42:01,040
intelligence and now we are doing
 

2439
00:42:01,040 --> 00:42:03,030
intelligence and now we are doing
the design manufacturing distribution of

2440

and the cost of that is going to zero

2444
00:42:06,550 --> 00:42:06,560
and the cost of that is going to zero
 

2445
00:42:06,560 --> 00:42:07,510
and the cost of that is going to zero
that's a very

2446
00:42:07,510 --> 00:42:07,520
that's a very
 

2447
00:42:07,520 --> 00:42:10,630
that's a very
uh nice way of looking at life on earth

2448
00:42:10,630 --> 00:42:10,640
uh nice way of looking at life on earth
 

2449
00:42:10,640 --> 00:42:12,950
uh nice way of looking at life on earth
so if that that's going on and then now

2450
00:42:12,950 --> 00:42:12,960
so if that that's going on and then now
 

2451
00:42:12,960 --> 00:42:13,990
so if that that's going on and then now
in parallel

2452
00:42:13,990 --> 00:42:14,000
in parallel
 

2453
00:42:14,000 --> 00:42:17,510
in parallel
to that then you say okay what

2454
00:42:17,510 --> 00:42:17,520
to that then you say okay what
 

2455
00:42:17,520 --> 00:42:19,910
to that then you say okay what
what then happens if when that cost

2456
00:42:19,910 --> 00:42:19,920
what then happens if when that cost
 

2457
00:42:19,920 --> 00:42:22,550
what then happens if when that cost
curve is heading

2458
00:42:22,550 --> 00:42:22,560
curve is heading
 

2459
00:42:22,560 --> 00:42:26,470

to zero our existence becomes

2460
00:42:26,470 --> 00:42:26,480
to zero our existence becomes
 

2461
00:42:26,480 --> 00:42:28,950
to zero our existence becomes
a goal alignment problem a goal

00:42:28,950 --> 00:42:28,960
a goal alignment problem a goal
 

2463
00:42:28,960 --> 00:42:31,190

and so the same thing i'm doing where

2466
00:42:33,109 --> 00:42:33,119
and so the same thing i'm doing where
 

2467
00:42:33,119 --> 00:42:34,710
and so the same thing i'm doing where
i'm doing goal alignment within myself

2468
00:42:34,710 --> 00:42:34,720
i'm doing goal alignment within myself
 

2469
00:42:34,720 --> 00:42:37,589
i'm doing goal alignment within myself
of these 200 biomarkers where i'm saying

2470
00:42:37,589 --> 00:42:37,599
of these 200 biomarkers where i'm saying
 

2471
00:42:37,599 --> 00:42:41,670
of these 200 biomarkers where i'm saying
when when brian exists on a daily basis

2472
00:42:41,670 --> 00:42:41,680
when when brian exists on a daily basis
 

2473
00:42:41,680 --> 00:42:43,510
when when brian exists on a daily basis
and this entity is deciding what to eat

2474
00:42:43,510 --> 00:42:43,520
and this entity is deciding what to eat
 

2475
00:42:43,520 --> 00:42:45,190
and this entity is deciding what to eat
what to do and et cetera

2476
00:42:45,190 --> 00:42:45,200
what to do and et cetera
 

2477
00:42:45,200 --> 00:42:47,190
what to do and et cetera
it's not just my conscious mind which is

2478
00:42:47,190 --> 00:42:47,200
it's not just my conscious mind which is
 

2479
00:42:47,200 --> 00:42:48,550
it's not just my conscious mind which is
opining it's

2480
00:42:48,550 --> 00:42:48,560
opining it's
 

2481
00:42:48,560 --> 00:42:50,630
opining it's
200 biological processes and there's a

2482
00:42:50,630 --> 00:42:50,640
200 biological processes and there's a
 

2483
00:42:50,640 --> 00:42:52,069
200 biological processes and there's a
whole bunch more voices involved

2484
00:42:52,069 --> 00:42:52,079
whole bunch more voices involved
 

2485
00:42:52,079 --> 00:42:57,270
whole bunch more voices involved
so in that equation

2486
00:42:57,270 --> 00:42:57,280

 

2487
00:42:57,280 --> 00:43:01,109

we're going to increasingly automate

2488
00:43:01,109 --> 00:43:01,119
we're going to increasingly automate
 

2489
00:43:01,119 --> 00:43:03,589
we're going to increasingly automate
the things that we spend high energy on

2490
00:43:03,589 --> 00:43:03,599
the things that we spend high energy on
 

2491
00:43:03,599 --> 00:43:05,190
the things that we spend high energy on
today because it's easier

2492
00:43:05,190 --> 00:43:05,200
today because it's easier
 

2493
00:43:05,200 --> 00:43:08,470
today because it's easier
and now we're going to then negotiate

2494
00:43:08,470 --> 00:43:08,480
and now we're going to then negotiate
 

2495
00:43:08,480 --> 00:43:10,630
and now we're going to then negotiate
the terms and conditions of intelligent

2496
00:43:10,630 --> 00:43:10,640
the terms and conditions of intelligent
 

2497
00:43:10,640 --> 00:43:12,309
the terms and conditions of intelligent
life now we say conscious existence

2498
00:43:12,309 --> 00:43:12,319
life now we say conscious existence
 

2499
00:43:12,319 --> 00:43:13,430
life now we say conscious existence
because we're biased because that's what

2500
00:43:13,430 --> 00:43:13,440
because we're biased because that's what
 

2501
00:43:13,440 --> 00:43:14,870
because we're biased because that's what
we have

2502
00:43:14,870 --> 00:43:14,880
we have
 

2503
00:43:14,880 --> 00:43:17,430
we have
but it will be the largest computational

2504
00:43:17,430 --> 00:43:17,440
but it will be the largest computational
 

2505
00:43:17,440 --> 00:43:19,030
but it will be the largest computational
exercise in history because you're now

the negotiation of goal alignment yeah

2524
00:43:36,550 --> 00:43:36,560
the negotiation of goal alignment yeah
 

2525
00:43:36,560 --> 00:43:39,270
the negotiation of goal alignment yeah
this this is in fact true uh and what

2526
00:43:39,270 --> 00:43:39,280
this this is in fact true uh and what
 

2527
00:43:39,280 --> 00:43:40,390
this this is in fact true uh and what
was the second thing

2528
00:43:40,390 --> 00:43:40,400
was the second thing
 

2529
00:43:40,400 --> 00:43:43,190
was the second thing
that was it so the cost the design

2530
00:43:43,190 --> 00:43:43,200
that was it so the cost the design
 

2531
00:43:43,200 --> 00:43:44,230
that was it so the cost the design

which then means what's really going on

2536
00:43:48,470 --> 00:43:48,480
which then means what's really going on
 

2537
00:43:48,480 --> 00:43:50,150
which then means what's really going on
what are we really doing

2538
00:43:50,150 --> 00:43:50,160
what are we really doing
 

2539
00:43:50,160 --> 00:43:51,589
what are we really doing
we're negotiating the terms and

2540
00:43:51,589 --> 00:43:51,599
we're negotiating the terms and

00:43:57,200 --> 00:44:01,349
of existence do you worry about
the survival of this process

2547
00:44:01,359 --> 00:44:03,829

that uh life as we know it on earth

that uh life as we know it on earth
 

2549
00:44:03,839 --> 00:44:04,790
that uh life as we know it on earth
comes to an end

comes to an end
 

2551
00:44:04,800 --> 00:44:07,270
comes to an end
or at least intelligent life that as the

or at least intelligent life that as the
 

2553
00:44:07,280 --> 00:44:08,950

00:44:12,230 --> 00:44:12,240
all something happens where uh

all of that intelligence is thrown in

2571
00:44:24,800 --> 00:44:28,230
the paper clip thing
what on mass is dumb but has unintended

do you worry about those kinds of things

2578
00:44:32,230 --> 00:44:32,240
do you worry about those kinds of things
 

2579
00:44:32,240 --> 00:44:34,950
do you worry about those kinds of things
i mean it's it's unsurprising

2580
00:44:34,950 --> 00:44:34,960
i mean it's it's unsurprising
 

2581
00:44:34,960 --> 00:44:38,550
i mean it's it's unsurprising
that a new thing comes into

00:44:38,550 --> 00:44:38,560
that a new thing comes into
 

2583
00:44:38,560 --> 00:44:41,510
that a new thing comes into
the sphere of human consciousness humans

identify the foreign object in this case

2586
00:44:43,829 --> 00:44:43,839

2593
00:44:50,640 --> 00:44:53,430

we should be apprehensive about this and

2594
00:44:53,430 --> 00:44:53,440
we should be apprehensive about this and
 

2595
00:44:53,440 --> 00:44:54,309
we should be apprehensive about this and
so it

2596
00:44:54,309 --> 00:44:54,319
so it
 

2597
00:44:54,319 --> 00:44:56,550
so it
makes sense from a biological

2598
00:44:56,550 --> 00:44:56,560
makes sense from a biological
 

2599
00:44:56,560 --> 00:44:57,589
makes sense from a biological

2603
00:45:02,000 --> 00:45:07,270

what i don't think has been properly

2604
00:45:07,270 --> 00:45:07,280

 

2605
00:45:07,280 --> 00:45:10,710

weighted with that is that

2606
00:45:10,710 --> 00:45:10,720
weighted with that is that
 

2607
00:45:10,720 --> 00:45:13,030
weighted with that is that
we are the first generation of

2608
00:45:13,030 --> 00:45:13,040
we are the first generation of
 

2609
00:45:13,040 --> 00:45:15,190
we are the first generation of
intelligent beings on this earth

2610
00:45:15,190 --> 00:45:15,200
intelligent beings on this earth
 

2611
00:45:15,200 --> 00:45:17,349
intelligent beings on this earth
that has been able to look out over

2612
00:45:17,349 --> 00:45:17,359
that has been able to look out over
 

2613
00:45:17,359 --> 00:45:20,309
that has been able to look out over
their expected lifetime

2614
00:45:20,309 --> 00:45:20,319
their expected lifetime
 

2615
00:45:20,319 --> 00:45:22,710
their expected lifetime
and see there is a real possibility of

2616
00:45:22,710 --> 00:45:22,720
and see there is a real possibility of
 

2617
00:45:22,720 --> 00:45:23,349
and see there is a real possibility of
evolving

2618
00:45:23,349 --> 00:45:23,359
evolving
 

2619
00:45:23,359 --> 00:45:25,030
evolving
into entirely novel forms of

00:45:25,030 --> 00:45:25,040
into entirely novel forms of

00:45:25,040 --> 00:45:27,510

2623
00:45:27,520 --> 00:45:30,230

yeah so different that it would be

2624
00:45:30,230 --> 00:45:30,240
yeah so different that it would be
 

2625
00:45:30,240 --> 00:45:30,950
yeah so different that it would be
totally

2626
00:45:30,950 --> 00:45:30,960
totally
 

2627
00:45:30,960 --> 00:45:33,349
totally
unrecognizable to us today we don't have

2628
00:45:33,349 --> 00:45:33,359
unrecognizable to us today we don't have
 

2629
00:45:33,359 --> 00:45:34,870
unrecognizable to us today we don't have
words for it we can't hint at it we

2630
00:45:34,870 --> 00:45:34,880
words for it we can't hint at it we
 

2631
00:45:34,880 --> 00:45:36,710
words for it we can't hint at it we
can't point at it we can't

2632
00:45:36,710 --> 00:45:36,720
can't point at it we can't
 

2633
00:45:36,720 --> 00:45:38,069
can't point at it we can't
you can't look in the sky and see that

2634
00:45:38,069 --> 00:45:38,079
you can't look in the sky and see that
 

2635
00:45:38,079 --> 00:45:39,829
you can't look in the sky and see that
thing that is shining we're going to go

2636
00:45:39,829 --> 00:45:39,839
thing that is shining we're going to go
 

2637
00:45:39,839 --> 00:45:40,950
thing that is shining we're going to go
up there

2638
00:45:40,950 --> 00:45:40,960
up there
 

2639
00:45:40,960 --> 00:45:43,589
up there
you you cannot even create an

2640
00:45:43,589 --> 00:45:43,599
you you cannot even create an
 

2641
00:45:43,599 --> 00:45:44,790
you you cannot even create an
aspirational

2642
00:45:44,790 --> 00:45:44,800
aspirational
 

2643
00:45:44,800 --> 00:45:47,990
aspirational
statement about it and

2644
00:45:47,990 --> 00:45:48,000
statement about it and
 

2645
00:45:48,000 --> 00:45:50,870
statement about it and
instead we've had this knee-jerk

2646
00:45:50,870 --> 00:45:50,880
instead we've had this knee-jerk
 

2647
00:45:50,880 --> 00:45:51,829
instead we've had this knee-jerk
reaction of fear

2648
00:45:51,829 --> 00:45:51,839
reaction of fear
 

2649
00:45:51,839 --> 00:45:54,550
reaction of fear
about everything that could go wrong but

2650
00:45:54,550 --> 00:45:54,560
about everything that could go wrong but
 

2651
00:45:54,560 --> 00:45:56,309
about everything that could go wrong but
in my estimation

2652
00:45:56,309 --> 00:45:56,319
in my estimation
 

2653
00:45:56,319 --> 00:46:00,630
in my estimation
this should be the defining aspiration

2654
00:46:00,630 --> 00:46:00,640
this should be the defining aspiration
 

2655
00:46:00,640 --> 00:46:03,510
this should be the defining aspiration
of all intelligent life on earth that

2656
00:46:03,510 --> 00:46:03,520
of all intelligent life on earth that
 

2657
00:46:03,520 --> 00:46:04,710
of all intelligent life on earth that
that we would aspire

2658
00:46:04,710 --> 00:46:04,720
that we would aspire
 

2659
00:46:04,720 --> 00:46:07,510
that we would aspire
that basically every generation surveys

2660
00:46:07,510 --> 00:46:07,520
that basically every generation surveys
 

2661
00:46:07,520 --> 00:46:08,950
that basically every generation surveys
the landscape of possibilities they're

2662
00:46:08,950 --> 00:46:08,960
the landscape of possibilities they're
 

2663
00:46:08,960 --> 00:46:09,510
the landscape of possibilities they're
afforded

2664
00:46:09,510 --> 00:46:09,520
afforded
 

2665
00:46:09,520 --> 00:46:11,349
afforded
given the technological cultural and

2666
00:46:11,349 --> 00:46:11,359
given the technological cultural and
 

2667
00:46:11,359 --> 00:46:13,430

in
we're in this context we haven't yet

we're in this context we haven't yet
 

2673
00:46:17,280 --> 00:46:19,589
we're in this context we haven't yet
identified this and said

2674
00:46:19,589 --> 00:46:19,599
identified this and said
 

2675
00:46:19,599 --> 00:46:22,710
identified this and said
this is unbelievable we should carefully

2676
00:46:22,710 --> 00:46:22,720
this is unbelievable we should carefully
 

2677
00:46:22,720 --> 00:46:24,150
this is unbelievable we should carefully
think this thing through

2678
00:46:24,150 --> 00:46:24,160
think this thing through
 

2679
00:46:24,160 --> 00:46:26,630
think this thing through
not just of mitigating the things that

2680
00:46:26,630 --> 00:46:26,640
not just of mitigating the things that
 

2681
00:46:26,640 --> 00:46:27,990
not just of mitigating the things that
wipe us out like we have

2682
00:46:27,990 --> 00:46:28,000
wipe us out like we have
 

2683
00:46:28,000 --> 00:46:30,390
wipe us out like we have
this potential and so we just haven't

2684
00:46:30,390 --> 00:46:30,400
this potential and so we just haven't
 

2685
00:46:30,400 --> 00:46:31,750
this potential and so we just haven't
given voice to it

2686
00:46:31,750 --> 00:46:31,760
given voice to it
 

2687
00:46:31,760 --> 00:46:32,950
given voice to it
even though it's within this realm of

2688
00:46:32,950 --> 00:46:32,960
even though it's within this realm of
 

2689
00:46:32,960 --> 00:46:34,710
even though it's within this realm of
possibilities so you're excited about

2690
00:46:34,710 --> 00:46:34,720
possibilities so you're excited about
 

2691
00:46:34,720 --> 00:46:35,750
possibilities so you're excited about
the possibility of

2692
00:46:35,750 --> 00:46:35,760
the possibility of
 

2693
00:46:35,760 --> 00:46:38,150
the possibility of
super intelligence systems and what the

2694
00:46:38,150 --> 00:46:38,160
super intelligence systems and what the
 

2695
00:46:38,160 --> 00:46:39,589
super intelligence systems and what the
opportunities that bring i mean

2696
00:46:39,589 --> 00:46:39,599
opportunities that bring i mean
 

2697
00:46:39,599 --> 00:46:41,990
opportunities that bring i mean
there's parallels to this you think

2698
00:46:41,990 --> 00:46:42,000
there's parallels to this you think
 

2699
00:46:42,000 --> 00:46:43,990
there's parallels to this you think
about people before the internet

2700
00:46:43,990 --> 00:46:44,000
about people before the internet
 

2701
00:46:44,000 --> 00:46:47,349
about people before the internet
as the internet was coming to life

2702
00:46:47,349 --> 00:46:47,359
as the internet was coming to life
 

2703
00:46:47,359 --> 00:46:49,270
as the internet was coming to life
i mean there's kind of a fog through

2704
00:46:49,270 --> 00:46:49,280
i mean there's kind of a fog through
 

2705
00:46:49,280 --> 00:46:50,950
i mean there's kind of a fog through
which you can't see

2706
00:46:50,950 --> 00:46:50,960
which you can't see
 

2707
00:46:50,960 --> 00:46:53,990
which you can't see
what does the future look like

2708
00:46:53,990 --> 00:46:54,000
what does the future look like
 

2709
00:46:54,000 --> 00:46:56,309
what does the future look like
like predicting collective intelligence

2710
00:46:56,309 --> 00:46:56,319
like predicting collective intelligence
 

2711
00:46:56,319 --> 00:46:57,670
like predicting collective intelligence
which i don't think we're understanding

2712
00:46:57,670 --> 00:46:57,680
which i don't think we're understanding
 

2713
00:46:57,680 --> 00:46:58,069
which i don't think we're understanding
that we're

2714
00:46:58,069 --> 00:46:58,079
that we're
 

2715
00:46:58,079 --> 00:46:59,910
that we're
living through that now is that there's

2716
00:46:59,910 --> 00:46:59,920
living through that now is that there's
 

2717
00:46:59,920 --> 00:47:01,589
living through that now is that there's
now we've

2718
00:47:01,589 --> 00:47:01,599
now we've
 

2719
00:47:01,599 --> 00:47:03,990
now we've
we've in some sense stopped being

2720
00:47:03,990 --> 00:47:04,000
we've in some sense stopped being
 

2721
00:47:04,000 --> 00:47:05,510
we've in some sense stopped being
individual intelligences

2722
00:47:05,510 --> 00:47:05,520
individual intelligences
 

2723
00:47:05,520 --> 00:47:08,069
individual intelligences
and become much more like collective

2724
00:47:08,069 --> 00:47:08,079
and become much more like collective
 

2725
00:47:08,079 --> 00:47:09,270
and become much more like collective
intelligences

2726
00:47:09,270 --> 00:47:09,280
intelligences
 

2727
00:47:09,280 --> 00:47:12,470
intelligences
because ideas travel much much

2728
00:47:12,470 --> 00:47:12,480
because ideas travel much much
 

2729
00:47:12,480 --> 00:47:16,309
because ideas travel much much
faster now and they can in a viral way

2730
00:47:16,309 --> 00:47:16,319
faster now and they can in a viral way
 

2731
00:47:16,319 --> 00:47:19,190
faster now and they can in a viral way
like sweep across the populations and so

2732
00:47:19,190 --> 00:47:19,200
like sweep across the populations and so
 

2733
00:47:19,200 --> 00:47:20,630
like sweep across the populations and so
it's almost

2734
00:47:20,630 --> 00:47:20,640
it's almost
 

2735
00:47:20,640 --> 00:47:23,829
it's almost
i mean it almost feels like a thought

2736
00:47:23,829 --> 00:47:23,839
i mean it almost feels like a thought
 

2737
00:47:23,839 --> 00:47:27,030
i mean it almost feels like a thought
is had by many people now thousands or

2738
00:47:27,030 --> 00:47:27,040
is had by many people now thousands or
 

2739
00:47:27,040 --> 00:47:28,470
is had by many people now thousands or
millions of people as opposed to an

2740
00:47:28,470 --> 00:47:28,480
millions of people as opposed to an
 

2741
00:47:28,480 --> 00:47:29,670
millions of people as opposed to an
individual person

2742
00:47:29,670 --> 00:47:29,680
individual person
 

2743
00:47:29,680 --> 00:47:31,670
individual person
and that's changed everything but to to

2744
00:47:31,670 --> 00:47:31,680
and that's changed everything but to to
 

2745
00:47:31,680 --> 00:47:33,030
and that's changed everything but to to
me i don't think we're realizing how

2746
00:47:33,030 --> 00:47:33,040
me i don't think we're realizing how
 

2747
00:47:33,040 --> 00:47:34,790
me i don't think we're realizing how
much that actually changed in people

2748
00:47:34,790 --> 00:47:34,800
much that actually changed in people
 

2749
00:47:34,800 --> 00:47:37,349
much that actually changed in people
or societies but like to predict that

2750
00:47:37,349 --> 00:47:37,359
or societies but like to predict that
 

2751
00:47:37,359 --> 00:47:38,790
or societies but like to predict that
before the internet

2752
00:47:38,790 --> 00:47:38,800
before the internet
 

2753
00:47:38,800 --> 00:47:41,349
before the internet
would have been very difficult and in

2754
00:47:41,349 --> 00:47:41,359
would have been very difficult and in
 

2755
00:47:41,359 --> 00:47:43,109
would have been very difficult and in
that same way we're sitting here

2756
00:47:43,109 --> 00:47:43,119
that same way we're sitting here
 

2757
00:47:43,119 --> 00:47:47,190
that same way we're sitting here
with the fog before us thinking what is

2758
00:47:47,190 --> 00:47:47,200
with the fog before us thinking what is
 

2759
00:47:47,200 --> 00:47:49,910
with the fog before us thinking what is
uh super intelligent systems how is that

2760
00:47:49,910 --> 00:47:49,920
uh super intelligent systems how is that
 

2761
00:47:49,920 --> 00:47:50,870
uh super intelligent systems how is that
going to change

2762
00:47:50,870 --> 00:47:50,880
going to change
 

2763
00:47:50,880 --> 00:47:54,150
going to change
the world what is uh increasing the

2764
00:47:54,150 --> 00:47:54,160
the world what is uh increasing the
 

2765
00:47:54,160 --> 00:47:55,589
the world what is uh increasing the
bandwidth like

2766
00:47:55,589 --> 00:47:55,599
bandwidth like
 

2767
00:47:55,599 --> 00:47:58,950
bandwidth like
uh plugging our brains into this whole

2768
00:47:58,950 --> 00:47:58,960
uh plugging our brains into this whole
 

2769
00:47:58,960 --> 00:48:00,470
uh plugging our brains into this whole
thing how is that going to change the

2770
00:48:00,470 --> 00:48:00,480
thing how is that going to change the
 

2771
00:48:00,480 --> 00:48:01,190
thing how is that going to change the
world

2772
00:48:01,190 --> 00:48:01,200
world
 

2773
00:48:01,200 --> 00:48:04,950
world
and it seems like it's a fog you don't

2774
00:48:04,950 --> 00:48:04,960
and it seems like it's a fog you don't
 

2775
00:48:04,960 --> 00:48:05,670
and it seems like it's a fog you don't
know

2776
00:48:05,670 --> 00:48:05,680
know
 

2777
00:48:05,680 --> 00:48:08,870
know
and it could be it could uh

2778
00:48:08,870 --> 00:48:08,880
and it could be it could uh
 

2779
00:48:08,880 --> 00:48:11,589
and it could be it could uh
whatever comes to be could destroy the

2780
00:48:11,589 --> 00:48:11,599
whatever comes to be could destroy the
 

2781
00:48:11,599 --> 00:48:13,190
whatever comes to be could destroy the
world that this we could be the last

2782
00:48:13,190 --> 00:48:13,200
world that this we could be the last
 

2783
00:48:13,200 --> 00:48:14,790
world that this we could be the last
generation

2784
00:48:14,790 --> 00:48:14,800
generation
 

2785
00:48:14,800 --> 00:48:17,670
generation
but it also could uh transform in in

2786
00:48:17,670 --> 00:48:17,680
but it also could uh transform in in
 

2787

ways that creates a an incredibly

it might involve dissolution of ego and
 

2795
00:48:29,760 --> 00:48:31,430
it might involve dissolution of ego and
consciousness and so on you're no longer

that might be a certain kind of death
 

2803
00:48:37,359 --> 00:48:39,829
that might be a certain kind of death
and ego death but the experience might

2804
00:48:39,829 --> 00:48:39,839
and ego death but the experience might
 

2805
00:48:39,839 --> 00:48:42,069
and ego death but the experience might
be really exciting and enriching

be really exciting and enriching

differently in different times in my
life i

2880
00:50:01,270 --> 00:50:01,280
life i
 

2881
00:50:01,280 --> 00:50:02,790
life i
you know had chronic depression for 10

2882
00:50:02,790 --> 00:50:02,800
you know had chronic depression for 10
 

2883
00:50:02,800 --> 00:50:05,990
you know had chronic depression for 10
years and so in that 10-year time period

2884
00:50:05,990 --> 00:50:06,000
years and so in that 10-year time period
 

2885
00:50:06,000 --> 00:50:09,030
years and so in that 10-year time period
i desperately wanted lights to be off

2886
00:50:09,030 --> 00:50:09,040
i desperately wanted lights to be off
 

2887
00:50:09,040 --> 00:50:11,990
i desperately wanted lights to be off
and the thing that made it even worse is

2888
00:50:11,990 --> 00:50:12,000
and the thing that made it even worse is
 

2889
00:50:12,000 --> 00:50:13,430
and the thing that made it even worse is
i was in a religious

2890
00:50:13,430 --> 00:50:13,440
i was in a religious
 

2891
00:50:13,440 --> 00:50:16,150
i was in a religious
i was born into a religion it was the

2892
00:50:16,150 --> 00:50:16,160
i was born into a religion it was the
 

2893
00:50:16,160 --> 00:50:18,230
i was born into a religion it was the
only reality i ever understood and it's

2894
00:50:18,230 --> 00:50:18,240
only reality i ever understood and it's
 

2895
00:50:18,240 --> 00:50:20,230
only reality i ever understood and it's
difficult to articulate to people

2896
00:50:20,230 --> 00:50:20,240
difficult to articulate to people
 

2897
00:50:20,240 --> 00:50:21,670
difficult to articulate to people
when you're born into that kind of

2898
00:50:21,670 --> 00:50:21,680
when you're born into that kind of
 

2899
00:50:21,680 --> 00:50:23,109
when you're born into that kind of
reality and it's the only reality you're

2900
00:50:23,109 --> 00:50:23,119
reality and it's the only reality you're
 

2901
00:50:23,119 --> 00:50:24,790
reality and it's the only reality you're
exposed to

2902
00:50:24,790 --> 00:50:24,800
exposed to
 

2903
00:50:24,800 --> 00:50:26,790
exposed to
you're literally blinded to the

2904
00:50:26,790 --> 00:50:26,800
you're literally blinded to the
 

2905
00:50:26,800 --> 00:50:28,150
you're literally blinded to the
existence of other realities

2906
00:50:28,150 --> 00:50:28,160
existence of other realities
 

2907
00:50:28,160 --> 00:50:30,230
existence of other realities
because it's so much the in-group out

2908
00:50:30,230 --> 00:50:30,240
because it's so much the in-group out
 

2909
00:50:30,240 --> 00:50:31,270
because it's so much the in-group out
group thing

2910
00:50:31,270 --> 00:50:31,280
group thing
 

2911
00:50:31,280 --> 00:50:34,390
group thing
and so in that situation it was not only

2912
00:50:34,390 --> 00:50:34,400
and so in that situation it was not only
 

2913
00:50:34,400 --> 00:50:35,910
and so in that situation it was not only
that i desperately wanted lights out

2914
00:50:35,910 --> 00:50:35,920
that i desperately wanted lights out
 

2915
00:50:35,920 --> 00:50:37,190
that i desperately wanted lights out
forever

2916
00:50:37,190 --> 00:50:37,200
forever
 

2917
00:50:37,200 --> 00:50:38,470
forever
it was that i couldn't have lights out

2918
00:50:38,470 --> 00:50:38,480
it was that i couldn't have lights out
 

2919
00:50:38,480 --> 00:50:40,630
it was that i couldn't have lights out
forever it was there was an afterlife

2920
00:50:40,630 --> 00:50:40,640
forever it was there was an afterlife
 

2921
00:50:40,640 --> 00:50:44,950
forever it was there was an afterlife
and this afterlife had this

2922
00:50:44,950 --> 00:50:44,960
and this afterlife had this
 

2923
00:50:44,960 --> 00:50:48,230
and this afterlife had this
system that would either penalize or or

2924
00:50:48,230 --> 00:50:48,240
system that would either penalize or or
 

2925
00:50:48,240 --> 00:50:50,790
system that would either penalize or or
reward you for your behaviors and so

2926
00:50:50,790 --> 00:50:50,800
reward you for your behaviors and so
 

2927
00:50:50,800 --> 00:50:53,750
reward you for your behaviors and so
it's almost like this

2928
00:50:53,750 --> 00:50:53,760
it's almost like this
 

2929
00:50:53,760 --> 00:50:57,750
it's almost like this
is indescribable hopelessness

2930
00:50:57,750 --> 00:50:57,760
is indescribable hopelessness
 

2931
00:50:57,760 --> 00:51:00,950
is indescribable hopelessness
of not only being in hopeless despair

2932
00:51:00,950 --> 00:51:00,960
of not only being in hopeless despair
 

2933
00:51:00,960 --> 00:51:02,549
of not only being in hopeless despair
of not wanting to exist but then also

2934
00:51:02,549 --> 00:51:02,559
of not wanting to exist but then also
 

2935
00:51:02,559 --> 00:51:05,030
of not wanting to exist but then also
being forced to be to exist

2936
00:51:05,030 --> 00:51:05,040
being forced to be to exist
 

2937
00:51:05,040 --> 00:51:06,790
being forced to be to exist
and so there was a duration of my time

2938
00:51:06,790 --> 00:51:06,800
and so there was a duration of my time
 

2939
00:51:06,800 --> 00:51:08,710
and so there was a duration of my time
of the observation of life where i'd say

2940
00:51:08,710 --> 00:51:08,720
of the observation of life where i'd say
 

2941
00:51:08,720 --> 00:51:11,990
of the observation of life where i'd say
yes i have no remorse

2942
00:51:11,990 --> 00:51:12,000
yes i have no remorse
 

2943
00:51:12,000 --> 00:51:14,069
yes i have no remorse
for lights being out and actually want

2944
00:51:14,069 --> 00:51:14,079
for lights being out and actually want
 

2945
00:51:14,079 --> 00:51:15,750
for lights being out and actually want
it more than anything in the entire

2946
00:51:15,750 --> 00:51:15,760
it more than anything in the entire
 

2947
00:51:15,760 --> 00:51:18,549
it more than anything in the entire
world

brutal environment in my brain and we've
 

3003

just become
normalized to this environment that we

3025
00:52:36,720 --> 00:52:37,910

yeah it depends on the contextual

3026
00:52:37,910 --> 00:52:37,920
yeah it depends on the contextual
 

3027
00:52:37,920 --> 00:52:39,349
yeah it depends on the contextual
setting like how am i feeling what

3028
00:52:39,349 --> 00:52:39,359
setting like how am i feeling what
 

3029
00:52:39,359 --> 00:52:40,790
setting like how am i feeling what
moment are you asking me that and that's

3030
00:52:40,790 --> 00:52:40,800
moment are you asking me that and that's
 

3031
00:52:40,800 --> 00:52:42,309
moment are you asking me that and that's
it's my mind is so fickle

3032
00:52:42,309 --> 00:52:42,319
it's my mind is so fickle
 

3033
00:52:42,319 --> 00:52:44,309
it's my mind is so fickle
and this is why again i don't trust my

3034
00:52:44,309 --> 00:52:44,319
and this is why again i don't trust my
 

3035
00:52:44,319 --> 00:52:46,470
and this is why again i don't trust my
conscious mind i have been

3036
00:52:46,470 --> 00:52:46,480
conscious mind i have been
 

3037
00:52:46,480 --> 00:52:48,630

given realities i was given a religious

3038
00:52:48,630 --> 00:52:48,640
given realities i was given a religious
 

3039

reality
 

3041
00:52:50,079 --> 00:52:52,549
reality
that was a video game and then i figured

3042
00:52:52,549 --> 00:52:52,559
that was a video game and then i figured
 

3043
00:52:52,559 --> 00:52:53,589
that was a video game and then i figured
out it was not

3044
00:52:53,589 --> 00:52:53,599
out it was not
 

3045
00:52:53,599 --> 00:52:55,349
out it was not
a real reality and then i lived in a

3046
00:52:55,349 --> 00:52:55,359
a real reality and then i lived in a
 

3047
00:52:55,359 --> 00:52:57,349
a real reality and then i lived in a
depressive reality which delivered

3048
00:52:57,349 --> 00:52:57,359
depressive reality which delivered
 

3049
00:52:57,359 --> 00:53:00,150
depressive reality which delivered
this terrible hopelessness that wasn't a

3050
00:53:00,150 --> 00:53:00,160
this terrible hopelessness that wasn't a
 

3051
00:53:00,160 --> 00:53:01,910
this terrible hopelessness that wasn't a
real reality then i discovered

3052
00:53:01,910 --> 00:53:01,920
real reality then i discovered
 

3053
00:53:01,920 --> 00:53:03,510
real reality then i discovered
uh behavioral psychology and i figured

3054
00:53:03,510 --> 00:53:03,520
uh behavioral psychology and i figured
 

3055
00:53:03,520 --> 00:53:06,390
uh behavioral psychology and i figured
out how biased 188 chronicle biases and

3056
00:53:06,390 --> 00:53:06,400
out how biased 188 chronicle biases and
 

3057
00:53:06,400 --> 00:53:07,990
out how biased 188 chronicle biases and
how my brain is distorting reality all

3058
00:53:07,990 --> 00:53:08,000
how my brain is distorting reality all
 

3059

to my awareness is wrong
on pawn landing and i just need to

3094
00:53:43,750 --> 00:53:43,760
on pawn landing and i just need to
 

3095
00:53:43,760 --> 00:53:45,349
on pawn landing and i just need to
figure out where it's wrong how it's

3096
00:53:45,349 --> 00:53:45,359
figure out where it's wrong how it's
 

3097
00:53:45,359 --> 00:53:46,790
figure out where it's wrong how it's
wrong how wrong it is

wrong how wrong it is
 

3099
00:53:46,800 --> 00:53:48,390
wrong how wrong it is
and then try to correct for it as best i

3100
00:53:48,390 --> 00:53:48,400
and then try to correct for it as best i
 

3101
00:53:48,400 --> 00:53:50,870
and then try to correct for it as best i
can but i i assume

3102
00:53:50,870 --> 00:53:50,880
can but i i assume
 

3103
00:53:50,880 --> 00:53:53,829
can but i i assume
that on impact it's mistaken in some

that on impact it's mistaken in some
 

3105
00:53:53,839 --> 00:53:55,510
that on impact it's mistaken in some
critical ways

i know you're not real yeah and so i'm

3168
00:55:08,789 --> 00:55:08,799
i know you're not real yeah and so i'm
 

3169
00:55:08,799 --> 00:55:10,549
i know you're not real yeah and so i'm
in a situation where for whatever reason

00:55:10,549 --> 00:55:10,559
in a situation where for whatever reason
 

3171
00:55:10,559 --> 00:55:11,349
in a situation where for whatever reason
i'm having this

3172
00:55:11,349 --> 00:55:11,359
i'm having this
 

3173
00:55:11,359 --> 00:55:14,470
i'm having this
this uh neurochemical state but

3174
00:55:14,470 --> 00:55:14,480
this uh neurochemical state but
 

3175
00:55:14,480 --> 00:55:16,870
this uh neurochemical state but
that state can be altered and so it

3176
00:55:16,870 --> 00:55:16,880
that state can be altered and so it
 

3177
00:55:16,880 --> 00:55:18,950
that state can be altered and so it
again it goes back to the realities of

3178
00:55:18,950 --> 00:55:18,960
again it goes back to the realities of
 

3179
00:55:18,960 --> 00:55:21,190
again it goes back to the realities of
the difficulties of of being human and

3180
00:55:21,190 --> 00:55:21,200
the difficulties of of being human and
 

3181
00:55:21,200 --> 00:55:22,390
the difficulties of of being human and
like when i was trying to solve my

3182
00:55:22,390 --> 00:55:22,400
like when i was trying to solve my
 

3183

systematically and nothing would fix it

3190
00:55:29,349 --> 00:55:29,359
systematically and nothing would fix it
 

3191
00:55:29,359 --> 00:55:30,309
systematically and nothing would fix it
and so

3192

and so
 

3193
00:55:30,319 --> 00:55:31,829
and so

whoa a lot of people talk about like the

3268
00:56:56,789 --> 00:56:56,799
whoa a lot of people talk about like the
 

3269
00:56:56,799 --> 00:56:57,990
whoa a lot of people talk about like the
meditative experience

3270
00:56:57,990 --> 00:56:58,000
meditative experience
 

3271
00:56:58,000 --> 00:57:00,069
meditative experience
will allow you to sort of you know look

3272
00:57:00,069 --> 00:57:00,079
will allow you to sort of you know look
 

3273
00:57:00,079 --> 00:57:01,589
will allow you to sort of you know look
at some basic things like the movement

3274
00:57:01,589 --> 00:57:01,599
at some basic things like the movement
 

3275
00:57:01,599 --> 00:57:02,710
at some basic things like the movement
of your hand

3276
00:57:02,710 --> 00:57:02,720
of your hand
 

3277
00:57:02,720 --> 00:57:05,109
of your hand
as uh deeply joyful because it's like

3278
00:57:05,109 --> 00:57:05,119
as uh deeply joyful because it's like
 

3279
00:57:05,119 --> 00:57:06,069
as uh deeply joyful because it's like
that's life

3280
00:57:06,069 --> 00:57:06,079
that's life
 

3281
00:57:06,079 --> 00:57:07,670
that's life
but i get that from just looking at a

3282
00:57:07,670 --> 00:57:07,680
but i get that from just looking at a
 

3283
00:57:07,680 --> 00:57:09,589
but i get that from just looking at a
cup like i'm waiting for the coffee to

3284
00:57:09,589 --> 00:57:09,599
cup like i'm waiting for the coffee to
 

3285
00:57:09,599 --> 00:57:09,910
cup like i'm waiting for the coffee to
brew

3286
00:57:09,910 --> 00:57:09,920
brew
 

3287
00:57:09,920 --> 00:57:13,510
brew
and i'll just be like [\h__\h]

3288
00:57:13,510 --> 00:57:13,520
and i'll just be like [\h__\h]
 

3289
00:57:13,520 --> 00:57:16,150
and i'll just be like [\h__\h]
life is awesome and i'll sometimes tweet

3290
00:57:16,150 --> 00:57:16,160
life is awesome and i'll sometimes tweet
 

3291
00:57:16,160 --> 00:57:17,670
life is awesome and i'll sometimes tweet
that but then i'll like regret it later

3292
00:57:17,670 --> 00:57:17,680
that but then i'll like regret it later
 

3293
00:57:17,680 --> 00:57:18,950
that but then i'll like regret it later
like god damn it you're so

3294
00:57:18,950 --> 00:57:18,960
like god damn it you're so
 

3295
00:57:18,960 --> 00:57:22,630
like god damn it you're so
uh ridiculous but yeah so but that

3296
00:57:22,630 --> 00:57:22,640
uh ridiculous but yeah so but that
 

3297
00:57:22,640 --> 00:57:25,670
uh ridiculous but yeah so but that
is purely chemistry like

3298
00:57:25,670 --> 00:57:25,680
is purely chemistry like
 

3299
00:57:25,680 --> 00:57:27,430
is purely chemistry like
there's no rational it doesn't fit with

3300
00:57:27,430 --> 00:57:27,440
there's no rational it doesn't fit with
 

3301
00:57:27,440 --> 00:57:29,030
there's no rational it doesn't fit with
the rest of my life i have all this [\h__\h]

3302
00:57:29,030 --> 00:57:29,040
the rest of my life i have all this [\h__\h]
 

3303
00:57:29,040 --> 00:57:31,430
the rest of my life i have all this [\h__\h]
i'm always late to stuff i'm always like

3304
00:57:31,430 --> 00:57:31,440
i'm always late to stuff i'm always like
 

3305
00:57:31,440 --> 00:57:32,309
i'm always late to stuff i'm always like
there's all stuff

3306
00:57:32,309 --> 00:57:32,319
there's all stuff
 

3307
00:57:32,319 --> 00:57:34,630
there's all stuff
you know i'm super self-critical like

3308
00:57:34,630 --> 00:57:34,640
you know i'm super self-critical like
 

3309
00:57:34,640 --> 00:57:36,230
you know i'm super self-critical like
really self-critical about everything i

3310
00:57:36,230 --> 00:57:36,240
really self-critical about everything i
 

3311
00:57:36,240 --> 00:57:36,870
really self-critical about everything i
do

3312
00:57:36,870 --> 00:57:36,880
do
 

3313
00:57:36,880 --> 00:57:38,710
do
i'm to the point i almost hate

3314
00:57:38,710 --> 00:57:38,720
i'm to the point i almost hate
 

3315
00:57:38,720 --> 00:57:40,069
i'm to the point i almost hate
everything i do but

3316
00:57:40,069 --> 00:57:40,079
everything i do but
 

3317
00:57:40,079 --> 00:57:42,309
everything i do but
there's this engine of joy for life

3318
00:57:42,309 --> 00:57:42,319
there's this engine of joy for life
 

3319
00:57:42,319 --> 00:57:43,430
there's this engine of joy for life
outside of all that

3320
00:57:43,430 --> 00:57:43,440
outside of all that
 

3321
00:57:43,440 --> 00:57:45,349
outside of all that
and that has to be chemistry and the

3322
00:57:45,349 --> 00:57:45,359
and that has to be chemistry and the
 

3323
00:57:45,359 --> 00:57:47,270
and that has to be chemistry and the
flip side of that is what depression

3324
00:57:47,270 --> 00:57:47,280
flip side of that is what depression
 

3325
00:57:47,280 --> 00:57:48,390
flip side of that is what depression
probably is

3326
00:57:48,390 --> 00:57:48,400
probably is
 

3327
00:57:48,400 --> 00:57:52,150
probably is
is the opposite of that feeling of

3328
00:57:52,150 --> 00:57:52,160
is the opposite of that feeling of
 

3329
00:57:52,160 --> 00:57:55,430
is the opposite of that feeling of
like because i i bet you that feeling of

3330
00:57:55,430 --> 00:57:55,440
like because i i bet you that feeling of
 

3331
00:57:55,440 --> 00:57:58,950
like because i i bet you that feeling of
the cup being amazing is would save

3332
00:57:58,950 --> 00:57:58,960
the cup being amazing is would save
 

3333
00:57:58,960 --> 00:58:01,109
the cup being amazing is would save
anybody in a state of depression like

3334
00:58:01,109 --> 00:58:01,119
anybody in a state of depression like
 

3335
00:58:01,119 --> 00:58:02,710
anybody in a state of depression like
that that would be like fresh

3336
00:58:02,710 --> 00:58:02,720
that that would be like fresh
 

3337
00:58:02,720 --> 00:58:04,870
that that would be like fresh
you're in a desert and it's a drink of

3338
00:58:04,870 --> 00:58:04,880
you're in a desert and it's a drink of
 

3339
00:58:04,880 --> 00:58:07,510
you're in a desert and it's a drink of
water

3340
00:58:07,510 --> 00:58:07,520

 

3341
00:58:07,520 --> 00:58:10,549

[\h__\h] man the brain is uh it would be

3342
00:58:10,549 --> 00:58:10,559
[\h__\h] man the brain is uh it would be
 

3343
00:58:10,559 --> 00:58:12,150
[\h__\h] man the brain is uh it would be
nice to understand where that's coming

3344
00:58:12,150 --> 00:58:12,160
nice to understand where that's coming
 

3345
00:58:12,160 --> 00:58:13,270
nice to understand where that's coming
from

3346
00:58:13,270 --> 00:58:13,280
from
 

3347
00:58:13,280 --> 00:58:17,349
from
to to be able to um to understand the

3348
00:58:17,349 --> 00:58:17,359
to to be able to um to understand the
 

3349
00:58:17,359 --> 00:58:19,109
to to be able to um to understand the
how you hit those lows and those highs

3350
00:58:19,109 --> 00:58:19,119
how you hit those lows and those highs
 

3351
00:58:19,119 --> 00:58:20,829
how you hit those lows and those highs
that have nothing to do with the actual

3352
00:58:20,829 --> 00:58:20,839
that have nothing to do with the actual
 

3353
00:58:20,839 --> 00:58:22,950
that have nothing to do with the actual
reality it has to do with some very

3354
00:58:22,950 --> 00:58:22,960
reality it has to do with some very
 

3355
00:58:22,960 --> 00:58:25,589
reality it has to do with some very
specific aspects

3356
00:58:25,589 --> 00:58:25,599
specific aspects
 

3357
00:58:25,599 --> 00:58:28,630
specific aspects
of how you maybe see the world maybe it

3358
00:58:28,630 --> 00:58:28,640
of how you maybe see the world maybe it
 

3359
00:58:28,640 --> 00:58:30,390
of how you maybe see the world maybe it
could be just like basic habits that you

3360
00:58:30,390 --> 00:58:30,400
could be just like basic habits that you
 

3361
00:58:30,400 --> 00:58:31,990
could be just like basic habits that you
engage in and then how to

3362
00:58:31,990 --> 00:58:32,000
engage in and then how to
 

3363
00:58:32,000 --> 00:58:34,309
engage in and then how to
walk along the line to to find those

3364
00:58:34,309 --> 00:58:34,319
walk along the line to to find those
 

3365
00:58:34,319 --> 00:58:36,309
walk along the line to to find those
experiences of joy and this goes back to

3366
00:58:36,309 --> 00:58:36,319
experiences of joy and this goes back to
 

3367
00:58:36,319 --> 00:58:37,990
experiences of joy and this goes back to
the discussion we're having of

3368
00:58:37,990 --> 00:58:38,000
the discussion we're having of
 

3369
00:58:38,000 --> 00:58:41,030
the discussion we're having of
human cognition is in volume

3370
00:58:41,030 --> 00:58:41,040
human cognition is in volume
 

3371
00:58:41,040 --> 00:58:44,150
human cognition is in volume
the largest input of raw material into

3372
00:58:44,150 --> 00:58:44,160
the largest input of raw material into
 

3373
00:58:44,160 --> 00:58:45,510
the largest input of raw material into
society

3374
00:58:45,510 --> 00:58:45,520
society
 

3375
00:58:45,520 --> 00:58:48,710
society
yeah and it's not quantified we have no

3376
00:58:48,710 --> 00:58:48,720
yeah and it's not quantified we have no
 

3377
00:58:48,720 --> 00:58:50,150
yeah and it's not quantified we have no
bearings on it

3378
00:58:50,150 --> 00:58:50,160
bearings on it
 

3379
00:58:50,160 --> 00:58:54,630
bearings on it
and so we just you wonder

3380
00:58:54,630 --> 00:58:54,640
and so we just you wonder
 

3381
00:58:54,640 --> 00:58:55,990
and so we just you wonder
we both articulated some of the

3382
00:58:55,990 --> 00:58:56,000
we both articulated some of the
 

3383
00:58:56,000 --> 00:58:58,630
we both articulated some of the
challenges we have in our own mind

3384
00:58:58,630 --> 00:58:58,640
challenges we have in our own mind
 

3385
00:58:58,640 --> 00:59:02,150
challenges we have in our own mind
and it's likely that others would say

3386
00:59:02,150 --> 00:59:02,160
and it's likely that others would say
 

3387
00:59:02,160 --> 00:59:04,069
and it's likely that others would say
i have something similar yeah and you

3388
00:59:04,069 --> 00:59:04,079
i have something similar yeah and you
 

3389
00:59:04,079 --> 00:59:07,430
i have something similar yeah and you
wonder when you look at society

3390
00:59:07,430 --> 00:59:07,440
wonder when you look at society
 

3391
00:59:07,440 --> 00:59:10,390
wonder when you look at society
what how does that contribute to all the

3392
00:59:10,390 --> 00:59:10,400
what how does that contribute to all the
 

3393
00:59:10,400 --> 00:59:10,950
what how does that contribute to all the
other

3394
00:59:10,950 --> 00:59:10,960
other
 

3395
00:59:10,960 --> 00:59:12,230
other
compounded problems that we're

3396
00:59:12,230 --> 00:59:12,240
compounded problems that we're
 

3397
00:59:12,240 --> 00:59:14,150
compounded problems that we're
experiencing how does that

3398
00:59:14,150 --> 00:59:14,160
experiencing how does that
 

3399
00:59:14,160 --> 00:59:16,870
experiencing how does that
blind us to the the opportunities we

3400
00:59:16,870 --> 00:59:16,880
blind us to the the opportunities we
 

3401
00:59:16,880 --> 00:59:18,470
blind us to the the opportunities we
could be looking at

3402
00:59:18,470 --> 00:59:18,480
could be looking at
 

3403
00:59:18,480 --> 00:59:22,870
could be looking at
and so it really it has this potential

3404
00:59:22,870 --> 00:59:22,880
and so it really it has this potential
 

3405
00:59:22,880 --> 00:59:25,430
and so it really it has this potential
distortion effect on reality that just

3406
00:59:25,430 --> 00:59:25,440
distortion effect on reality that just
 

3407
00:59:25,440 --> 00:59:25,910
distortion effect on reality that just
makes

3408
00:59:25,910 --> 00:59:25,920
makes
 

3409
00:59:25,920 --> 00:59:29,109
makes
everything worse and i hope

3410
00:59:29,109 --> 00:59:29,119
everything worse and i hope
 

3411
00:59:29,119 --> 00:59:32,309
everything worse and i hope
if we can put some if we can

3412
00:59:32,309 --> 00:59:32,319
if we can put some if we can
 

3413
00:59:32,319 --> 00:59:34,710
if we can put some if we can
assign some numbers to these things just

3414
00:59:34,710 --> 00:59:34,720
assign some numbers to these things just
 

3415
00:59:34,720 --> 00:59:36,230
assign some numbers to these things just
to get our bearings

3416
00:59:36,230 --> 00:59:36,240
to get our bearings
 

3417
00:59:36,240 --> 00:59:38,390
to get our bearings
so we're aware of what's going on if we

3418
00:59:38,390 --> 00:59:38,400
so we're aware of what's going on if we
 

3419
00:59:38,400 --> 00:59:40,069
so we're aware of what's going on if we
could find greater stabilization

3420
00:59:40,069 --> 00:59:40,079
could find greater stabilization
 

3421
00:59:40,079 --> 00:59:41,670
could find greater stabilization
in how we conduct our lives and how we

3422
00:59:41,670 --> 00:59:41,680
in how we conduct our lives and how we
 

3423
00:59:41,680 --> 00:59:45,670
in how we conduct our lives and how we
build society

3424
00:59:45,670 --> 00:59:45,680

 

3425
00:59:45,680 --> 00:59:48,470

it it might be the thing that enables us

3426
00:59:48,470 --> 00:59:48,480

and how can data about this help us

3480
01:00:46,630 --> 01:00:46,640
and how can data about this help us
 

3481
01:00:46,640 --> 01:00:48,230
and how can data about this help us
understand it

3482
01:00:48,230 --> 01:00:48,240
understand it
 

3483
01:00:48,240 --> 01:00:50,150
understand it
and uh when you're on dmt do you see

3484
01:00:50,150 --> 01:00:50,160
and uh when you're on dmt do you see
 

3485
01:00:50,160 --> 01:00:51,270
and uh when you're on dmt do you see
else and can we guess

3486
01:00:51,270 --> 01:00:51,280
else and can we guess
 

3487
01:00:51,280 --> 01:00:54,630
else and can we guess
can we convert into data um can you add

3488
01:00:54,630 --> 01:00:54,640
can we convert into data um can you add
 

3489
01:00:54,640 --> 01:00:56,309
can we convert into data um can you add

yeah a bit of a and and the whole point
 

3551
01:01:55,520 --> 01:01:57,270
yeah a bit of a and and the whole point
is that in psychedelics

3552
01:01:57,270 --> 01:01:57,280
is that in psychedelics
 

3553
01:01:57,280 --> 01:02:00,230
is that in psychedelics
and certainly at dmt where this is where

3554
01:02:00,230 --> 01:02:00,240
and certainly at dmt where this is where
 

3555
01:02:00,240 --> 01:02:01,029
and certainly at dmt where this is where
the

3556
01:02:01,029 --> 01:02:01,039
the
 

3557
01:02:01,039 --> 01:02:05,029
the
the the brain data versus war data

3558
01:02:05,029 --> 01:02:05,039
the the brain data versus war data
 

3559
01:02:05,039 --> 01:02:07,190
the the brain data versus war data
fails which is you know words can't

3560
01:02:07,190 --> 01:02:07,200
fails which is you know words can't
 

3561
01:02:07,200 --> 01:02:08,150
fails which is you know words can't
convey the experience

3562
01:02:08,150 --> 01:02:08,160
convey the experience
 

3563
01:02:08,160 --> 01:02:10,069

01:02:33,349 --> 01:02:33,359
close your eyes and you think
 

3589
01:02:33,359 --> 01:02:34,950
close your eyes and you think
it feels all right like things seem

3590
01:02:34,950 --> 01:02:34,960
it feels all right like things seem
 

3591
01:02:34,960 --> 01:02:36,549
it feels all right like things seem
things feel okay

3592
01:02:36,549 --> 01:02:36,559
things feel okay
 

3593
01:02:36,559 --> 01:02:38,150
things feel okay
and then you went to the cardiologist

3594
01:02:38,150 --> 01:02:38,160
and then you went to the cardiologist
 

3595
01:02:38,160 --> 01:02:39,589
and then you went to the cardiologist
and the cardiologist like hey lex

3596
01:02:39,589 --> 01:02:39,599
and the cardiologist like hey lex
 

3597
01:02:39,599 --> 01:02:41,670
and the cardiologist like hey lex
you know tell me how you feel actually

3598
01:02:41,670 --> 01:02:41,680
you know tell me how you feel actually
 

3599
01:02:41,680 --> 01:02:42,789
you know tell me how you feel actually
what i'd really like

3600
01:02:42,789 --> 01:02:42,799
what i'd really like
 

3601
01:02:42,799 --> 01:02:45,750
what i'd really like
you to do is do an ekg and a blood panel

3602
01:02:45,750 --> 01:02:45,760
you to do is do an ekg and a blood panel
 

3603
01:02:45,760 --> 01:02:47,430
you to do is do an ekg and a blood panel
and look at arterial plaques

3604
01:02:47,430 --> 01:02:47,440
and look at arterial plaques
 

3605
01:02:47,440 --> 01:02:49,750
and look at arterial plaques
and let's look at my cholesterol and

3606
01:02:49,750 --> 01:02:49,760
and let's look at my cholesterol and
 

3607
01:02:49,760 --> 01:02:51,190
and let's look at my cholesterol and
there's like

3608
01:02:51,190 --> 01:02:51,200
there's like
 

3609
01:02:51,200 --> 01:02:53,270
there's like
five to ten studies you would do they

3610
01:02:53,270 --> 01:02:53,280
five to ten studies you would do they
 

3611
01:02:53,280 --> 01:02:55,349
five to ten studies you would do they
then give you this report and say here's

3612
01:02:55,349 --> 01:02:55,359
then give you this report and say here's
 

3613
01:02:55,359 --> 01:02:58,150
then give you this report and say here's
the quantified health of your heart now

3614
01:02:58,150 --> 01:02:58,160
the quantified health of your heart now
 

3615
01:02:58,160 --> 01:02:59,670
the quantified health of your heart now
with this data

3616
01:02:59,670 --> 01:02:59,680
with this data
 

3617
01:02:59,680 --> 01:03:01,670
with this data
i'm going to prescribe the following

3618
01:03:01,670 --> 01:03:01,680
i'm going to prescribe the following
 

3619
01:03:01,680 --> 01:03:03,510
i'm going to prescribe the following
regime of exercise and maybe i'll put

3620
01:03:03,510 --> 01:03:03,520
regime of exercise and maybe i'll put
 

3621
01:03:03,520 --> 01:03:04,470
regime of exercise and maybe i'll put
you on a statin

3622
01:03:04,470 --> 01:03:04,480
you on a statin
 

3623
01:03:04,480 --> 01:03:07,829
you on a statin
like et cetera but the protocol is based

3624
01:03:07,829 --> 01:03:07,839
like et cetera but the protocol is based
 

3625
01:03:07,839 --> 01:03:09,029
like et cetera but the protocol is based
upon this data you would

3626
01:03:09,029 --> 01:03:09,039
upon this data you would
 

3627
01:03:09,039 --> 01:03:10,710
upon this data you would
think the cardiologist is out of their

3628
01:03:10,710 --> 01:03:10,720
think the cardiologist is out of their
 

3629
01:03:10,720 --> 01:03:12,950
think the cardiologist is out of their
mind if they just gave you a bottle of

3630
01:03:12,950 --> 01:03:12,960
mind if they just gave you a bottle of
 

3631
01:03:12,960 --> 01:03:13,750
mind if they just gave you a bottle of
statins

3632
01:03:13,750 --> 01:03:13,760
statins
 

3633
01:03:13,760 --> 01:03:15,109
statins
based upon you're like well i think

3634
01:03:15,109 --> 01:03:15,119
based upon you're like well i think
 

3635
01:03:15,119 --> 01:03:16,470
based upon you're like well i think
something's kind of wrong and they're

3636
01:03:16,470 --> 01:03:16,480
something's kind of wrong and they're
 

3637
01:03:16,480 --> 01:03:17,829
something's kind of wrong and they're
just just kind of

3638
01:03:17,829 --> 01:03:17,839
just just kind of
 

3639
01:03:17,839 --> 01:03:20,150
just just kind of
experiment and see what happens that's

3640
01:03:20,150 --> 01:03:20,160
experiment and see what happens that's
 

3641
01:03:20,160 --> 01:03:22,470
experiment and see what happens that's
what we do with our mental health today

3642
01:03:22,470 --> 01:03:22,480
what we do with our mental health today
 

3643
01:03:22,480 --> 01:03:25,029
what we do with our mental health today
so you're it's it's kind of absurd and

3644
01:03:25,029 --> 01:03:25,039
so you're it's it's kind of absurd and
 

3645
01:03:25,039 --> 01:03:27,349
so you're it's it's kind of absurd and
so if you look at psychedelics

3646
01:03:27,349 --> 01:03:27,359
so if you look at psychedelics
 

3647
01:03:27,359 --> 01:03:29,029
so if you look at psychedelics
to have again to be able to measure the

3648
01:03:29,029 --> 01:03:29,039
to have again to be able to measure the
 

3649
01:03:29,039 --> 01:03:31,430
to have again to be able to measure the
brain and get a baseline state

3650
01:03:31,430 --> 01:03:31,440
brain and get a baseline state
 

3651
01:03:31,440 --> 01:03:33,349
brain and get a baseline state
and then to measure during a psychedelic

3652
01:03:33,349 --> 01:03:33,359
and then to measure during a psychedelic
 

3653
01:03:33,359 --> 01:03:34,710
and then to measure during a psychedelic
experience and post a psychedelic

3654
01:03:34,710 --> 01:03:34,720
experience and post a psychedelic
 

3655
01:03:34,720 --> 01:03:37,109
experience and post a psychedelic
experience then do it longitudinally

3656
01:03:37,109 --> 01:03:37,119
experience then do it longitudinally
 

3657
01:03:37,119 --> 01:03:38,870
experience then do it longitudinally
you now have a quantification of what's

3658
01:03:38,870 --> 01:03:38,880
you now have a quantification of what's
 

3659
01:03:38,880 --> 01:03:40,230
you now have a quantification of what's
going on and so

3660
01:03:40,230 --> 01:03:40,240
going on and so
 

3661
01:03:40,240 --> 01:03:41,829
going on and so
you could then pose questions what

3662
01:03:41,829 --> 01:03:41,839
you could then pose questions what
 

3663
01:03:41,839 --> 01:03:43,750
you could then pose questions what
molecule is appropriate

3664
01:03:43,750 --> 01:03:43,760
molecule is appropriate
 

3665
01:03:43,760 --> 01:03:46,230
molecule is appropriate
at what dosages at what frequency in

3666
01:03:46,230 --> 01:03:46,240
at what dosages at what frequency in
 

3667
01:03:46,240 --> 01:03:47,670
at what dosages at what frequency in
what contextual environment

3668
01:03:47,670 --> 01:03:47,680
what contextual environment
 

3669
01:03:47,680 --> 01:03:49,510
what contextual environment
what happens when i have this diet with

3670
01:03:49,510 --> 01:03:49,520
what happens when i have this diet with
 

3671
01:03:49,520 --> 01:03:51,270
what happens when i have this diet with
this molecule with this experience

3672
01:03:51,270 --> 01:03:51,280
this molecule with this experience
 

3673
01:03:51,280 --> 01:03:52,870
this molecule with this experience
all the experimentation you do when you

3674
01:03:52,870 --> 01:03:52,880
all the experimentation you do when you
 

3675
01:03:52,880 --> 01:03:54,309
all the experimentation you do when you
have good sleep data or

3676
01:03:54,309 --> 01:03:54,319
have good sleep data or
 

3677
01:03:54,319 --> 01:03:57,670
have good sleep data or
hrv and so that's what i think happens

3678
01:03:57,670 --> 01:03:57,680
hrv and so that's what i think happens
 

3679
01:03:57,680 --> 01:03:59,670
hrv and so that's what i think happens
what we could potentially do with

3680
01:03:59,670 --> 01:03:59,680
what we could potentially do with
 

3681
01:03:59,680 --> 01:04:01,430
what we could potentially do with
psychedelics is we could add this level

3682
01:04:01,430 --> 01:04:01,440
psychedelics is we could add this level
 

3683
01:04:01,440 --> 01:04:02,950
psychedelics is we could add this level
of sophistication

3684
01:04:02,950 --> 01:04:02,960
of sophistication
 

3685
01:04:02,960 --> 01:04:05,190
of sophistication
that is not in the industry currently

3686
01:04:05,190 --> 01:04:05,200
that is not in the industry currently
 

3687
01:04:05,200 --> 01:04:06,710
that is not in the industry currently
and it may

3688
01:04:06,710 --> 01:04:06,720
and it may
 

3689
01:04:06,720 --> 01:04:08,870
and it may
improve the outcomes people experience

3690
01:04:08,870 --> 01:04:08,880
improve the outcomes people experience
 

3691
01:04:08,880 --> 01:04:11,430
improve the outcomes people experience
it may improve the safety and efficacy

3692
01:04:11,430 --> 01:04:11,440
it may improve the safety and efficacy
 

3693
01:04:11,440 --> 01:04:13,510
it may improve the safety and efficacy
and so that's what i hope we are able to

3694
01:04:13,510 --> 01:04:13,520
and so that's what i hope we are able to
 

3695
01:04:13,520 --> 01:04:15,670
and so that's what i hope we are able to
achieve and

3696
01:04:15,670 --> 01:04:15,680
achieve and
 

3697
01:04:15,680 --> 01:04:19,109
achieve and
it would transform mental health

3698
01:04:19,109 --> 01:04:19,119
it would transform mental health
 

3699
01:04:19,119 --> 01:04:21,190
it would transform mental health
because we would finally have numbers to

3700
01:04:21,190 --> 01:04:21,200
because we would finally have numbers to
 

3701
01:04:21,200 --> 01:04:22,870
because we would finally have numbers to
work with to baseline ourselves and then

3702
01:04:22,870 --> 01:04:22,880
work with to baseline ourselves and then
 

3703
01:04:22,880 --> 01:04:25,589
work with to baseline ourselves and then
if you think about it we when we talk

3704
01:04:25,589 --> 01:04:25,599
if you think about it we when we talk
 

3705
01:04:25,599 --> 01:04:27,029
if you think about it we when we talk
about things related to the mind we talk

3706
01:04:27,029 --> 01:04:27,039
about things related to the mind we talk
 

3707
01:04:27,039 --> 01:04:29,109
about things related to the mind we talk
about the modality we use words like

3708
01:04:29,109 --> 01:04:29,119
about the modality we use words like
 

3709
01:04:29,119 --> 01:04:30,710
about the modality we use words like
meditation or psychedelics or

3710
01:04:30,710 --> 01:04:30,720
meditation or psychedelics or
 

3711
01:04:30,720 --> 01:04:32,789
meditation or psychedelics or
or something else because we can't talk

3712
01:04:32,789 --> 01:04:32,799
or something else because we can't talk
 

3713
01:04:32,799 --> 01:04:34,710
or something else because we can't talk
about a marker in the brain we can't use

3714
01:04:34,710 --> 01:04:34,720
about a marker in the brain we can't use
 

3715
01:04:34,720 --> 01:04:35,589
about a marker in the brain we can't use
a word to say

3716
01:04:35,589 --> 01:04:35,599
a word to say
 

3717
01:04:35,599 --> 01:04:37,109
a word to say
we can't talk about cholesterol we don't

3718
01:04:37,109 --> 01:04:37,119
we can't talk about cholesterol we don't
 

3719
01:04:37,119 --> 01:04:38,390
we can't talk about cholesterol we don't
talk about plaque in the arteries we

3720
01:04:38,390 --> 01:04:38,400
talk about plaque in the arteries we
 

3721
01:04:38,400 --> 01:04:39,190
talk about plaque in the arteries we
don't talk about

3722
01:04:39,190 --> 01:04:39,200
don't talk about
 

3723
01:04:39,200 --> 01:04:42,950
don't talk about
hrv and so if we have numbers then

3724
01:04:42,950 --> 01:04:42,960
hrv and so if we have numbers then
 

3725
01:04:42,960 --> 01:04:45,430
hrv and so if we have numbers then
the solutions get mapped to numbers

3726
01:04:45,430 --> 01:04:45,440
the solutions get mapped to numbers
 

3727
01:04:45,440 --> 01:04:47,029
the solutions get mapped to numbers
instead of the modalities being the

3728
01:04:47,029 --> 01:04:47,039
instead of the modalities being the
 

3729
01:04:47,039 --> 01:04:48,950
instead of the modalities being the
thing we talk about meditation just does

3730
01:04:48,950 --> 01:04:48,960
thing we talk about meditation just does
 

3731
01:04:48,960 --> 01:04:52,470
thing we talk about meditation just does
good things in a crude fashion

3732
01:04:52,470 --> 01:04:52,480
good things in a crude fashion
 

3733
01:04:52,480 --> 01:04:54,710
good things in a crude fashion
so in your blog post zeroth principle

3734
01:04:54,710 --> 01:04:54,720
so in your blog post zeroth principle
 

3735
01:04:54,720 --> 01:04:56,950
so in your blog post zeroth principle
thinking good title you ponder how do

3736
01:04:56,950 --> 01:04:56,960
thinking good title you ponder how do
 

3737

thinking good title you ponder how do
people come up with uh truly original

3738
01:04:58,630 --> 01:04:58,640
people come up with uh truly original
 

3739
01:04:58,640 --> 01:04:59,670
people come up with uh truly original
ideas

3740

ideas
 

3741
01:04:59,680 --> 01:05:02,150
ideas
uh what what's your thoughts on this as

3742
01:05:02,150 --> 01:05:02,160
uh what what's your thoughts on this as
 

3743
01:05:02,160 --> 01:05:02,789
uh what what's your thoughts on this as
a human

3744
01:05:02,789 --> 01:05:02,799
a human
 

3745
01:05:02,799 --> 01:05:04,309
a human
and as a person who's measuring brain

3746
01:05:04,309 --> 01:05:04,319
and as a person who's measuring brain
 

3747
01:05:04,319 --> 01:05:06,390
and as a person who's measuring brain
data zeroth

3748
01:05:06,390 --> 01:05:06,400
data zeroth

principles are building blocks

3750
01:05:09,750 --> 01:05:09,760
principles are building blocks
 

3751
01:05:09,760 --> 01:05:12,710
principles are building blocks
first principles are understanding of

3752
01:05:12,710 --> 01:05:12,720
first principles are understanding of
 

3753
01:05:12,720 --> 01:05:14,390
first principles are understanding of
system laws

3754
01:05:14,390 --> 01:05:14,400
system laws
 

3755
01:05:14,400 --> 01:05:16,150
system laws
so if you take for example like in

3756
01:05:16,150 --> 01:05:16,160
so if you take for example like in
 

3757
01:05:16,160 --> 01:05:18,309
so if you take for example like in
sherlock holmes he's a first principle

so he says once you've eliminated

3762
01:05:23,109 --> 01:05:23,119
so he says once you've eliminated
 

3763
01:05:23,119 --> 01:05:26,150
so he says once you've eliminated
the impossible anything that remains

3764
01:05:26,150 --> 01:05:26,160
the impossible anything that remains
 

3765
01:05:26,160 --> 01:05:28,309
the impossible anything that remains
however improbable

so when someone says from a first

3776
01:05:40,789 --> 01:05:40,799
so when someone says from a first
 

3777
01:05:40,799 --> 01:05:43,910
so when someone says from a first
principal's perspective

3778
01:05:43,910 --> 01:05:43,920
principal's perspective
 

3779
01:05:43,920 --> 01:05:46,549
principal's perspective
and they they're trying to assume the

3780
01:05:46,549 --> 01:05:46,559
and they they're trying to assume the
 

3781
01:05:46,559 --> 01:05:48,870
and they they're trying to assume the
fewest number of things

3782
01:05:48,870 --> 01:05:48,880
fewest number of things
 

3783
01:05:48,880 --> 01:05:53,029
fewest number of things
within a given time frame and so when i

3784
01:05:53,029 --> 01:05:53,039
within a given time frame and so when i
 

3785
01:05:53,039 --> 01:05:56,309
within a given time frame and so when i

after braintree venmo
 

3787
01:05:56,319 --> 01:05:59,990
after braintree venmo
i set my mind to the question of

3788
01:05:59,990 --> 01:06:00,000
i set my mind to the question of
 

3789
01:06:00,000 --> 01:06:01,910
i set my mind to the question of
what single thing can i do that would

3790
01:06:01,910 --> 01:06:01,920
what single thing can i do that would
 

3791
01:06:01,920 --> 01:06:03,589
what single thing can i do that would
maximally increase the probability that

01:06:07,029 --> 01:06:07,039
imagine
 

3799
01:06:07,039 --> 01:06:09,990
imagine
and i found that in my conversations

3800
01:06:09,990 --> 01:06:10,000
and i found that in my conversations
 

3801
01:06:10,000 --> 01:06:11,910
and i found that in my conversations
with others in the books i read

3802
01:06:11,910 --> 01:06:11,920
with others in the books i read
 

3803
01:06:11,920 --> 01:06:15,349
with others in the books i read
in my own deliberations i had a missing

3804
01:06:15,349 --> 01:06:15,359
in my own deliberations i had a missing
 

3805
01:06:15,359 --> 01:06:17,430
in my own deliberations i had a missing
piece of the puzzle

3806
01:06:17,430 --> 01:06:17,440
piece of the puzzle
 

3807
01:06:17,440 --> 01:06:20,549
piece of the puzzle
because i didn't feel like uh over if

3808
01:06:20,549 --> 01:06:20,559
because i didn't feel like uh over if
 

3809
01:06:20,559 --> 01:06:23,029
because i didn't feel like uh over if
yeah i didn't feel like the future

3810
01:06:23,029 --> 01:06:23,039
yeah i didn't feel like the future
 

3811
01:06:23,039 --> 01:06:25,990
yeah i didn't feel like the future
could be deduced from first principle

3812
01:06:25,990 --> 01:06:26,000
could be deduced from first principle
 

3813
01:06:26,000 --> 01:06:27,750
could be deduced from first principle
thinking

3814
01:06:27,750 --> 01:06:27,760
thinking
 

3815
01:06:27,760 --> 01:06:30,630
thinking
and that's when i i read the book zero a

3816
01:06:30,630 --> 01:06:30,640
and that's when i i read the book zero a
 

3817
01:06:30,640 --> 01:06:33,029
and that's when i i read the book zero a
biography of a dangerous idea

3818
01:06:33,029 --> 01:06:33,039
biography of a dangerous idea
 

3819
01:06:33,039 --> 01:06:34,710
biography of a dangerous idea
and i i have a really good book by the

3820
01:06:34,710 --> 01:06:34,720
and i i have a really good book by the
 

3821
01:06:34,720 --> 01:06:36,230
and i i have a really good book by the
way it's

3822
01:06:36,230 --> 01:06:36,240
way it's
 

3823
01:06:36,240 --> 01:06:37,750
way it's
i think it's my favorite book i've ever

3824
01:06:37,750 --> 01:06:37,760
i think it's my favorite book i've ever
 

3825
01:06:37,760 --> 01:06:39,270
i think it's my favorite book i've ever
read it's also a really interesting

3826
01:06:39,270 --> 01:06:39,280
read it's also a really interesting
 

3827
01:06:39,280 --> 01:06:39,990
read it's also a really interesting
number

3828
01:06:39,990 --> 01:06:40,000
number
 

3829
01:06:40,000 --> 01:06:42,870
number
zero and i i wasn't aware that the

3830
01:06:42,870 --> 01:06:42,880
zero and i i wasn't aware that the
 

3831
01:06:42,880 --> 01:06:44,309
zero and i i wasn't aware that the
number zero had to be discovered i

3832
01:06:44,309 --> 01:06:44,319
number zero had to be discovered i
 

3833
01:06:44,319 --> 01:06:45,750
number zero had to be discovered i
didn't realize that it caused a

3834
01:06:45,750 --> 01:06:45,760
didn't realize that it caused a
 

3835
01:06:45,760 --> 01:06:48,470
didn't realize that it caused a
revolution in philosophy and

3836
01:06:48,470 --> 01:06:48,480
revolution in philosophy and
 

3837
01:06:48,480 --> 01:06:50,390
revolution in philosophy and
it just tore up math and it tore up i

3838
01:06:50,390 --> 01:06:50,400
it just tore up math and it tore up i
 

3839
01:06:50,400 --> 01:06:52,789
it just tore up math and it tore up i
mean it builds modern society but it

3840
01:06:52,789 --> 01:06:52,799
mean it builds modern society but it
 

3841
01:06:52,799 --> 01:06:55,349
mean it builds modern society but it
it wrecked everything in its way it was

3842
01:06:55,349 --> 01:06:55,359
it wrecked everything in its way it was
 

3843
01:06:55,359 --> 01:06:57,270
it wrecked everything in its way it was
an unbelievable disrupter and it

3844
01:06:57,270 --> 01:06:57,280
an unbelievable disrupter and it
 

3845
01:06:57,280 --> 01:06:59,510
an unbelievable disrupter and it
was so difficult for society to get

3846
01:06:59,510 --> 01:06:59,520
was so difficult for society to get
 

3847
01:06:59,520 --> 01:07:00,710
was so difficult for society to get
their heads around it

3848
01:07:00,710 --> 01:07:00,720
their heads around it
 

3849
01:07:00,720 --> 01:07:05,029
their heads around it
yeah and so zero is of course the

3850
01:07:05,029 --> 01:07:05,039
yeah and so zero is of course the
 

3851
01:07:05,039 --> 01:07:06,390
yeah and so zero is of course the
representation of zeroth principle

3852
01:07:06,390 --> 01:07:06,400
representation of zeroth principle
 

3853
01:07:06,400 --> 01:07:08,470
representation of zeroth principle
thinking which is it's

3854
01:07:08,470 --> 01:07:08,480
thinking which is it's
 

3855
01:07:08,480 --> 01:07:11,430
thinking which is it's
the caliber and consequential nature of

3856
01:07:11,430 --> 01:07:11,440
the caliber and consequential nature of
 

3857
01:07:11,440 --> 01:07:13,510
the caliber and consequential nature of
an idea

3858
01:07:13,510 --> 01:07:13,520
an idea
 

3859
01:07:13,520 --> 01:07:16,390
an idea
and so when you talk about what kind of

3860
01:07:16,390 --> 01:07:16,400
and so when you talk about what kind of
 

3861
01:07:16,400 --> 01:07:18,710
and so when you talk about what kind of
ideas

3862
01:07:18,710 --> 01:07:18,720
ideas
 

3863
01:07:18,720 --> 01:07:21,270
ideas
have civilization transforming

3864
01:07:21,270 --> 01:07:21,280
have civilization transforming
 

3865
01:07:21,280 --> 01:07:23,270
have civilization transforming
properties

3866
01:07:23,270 --> 01:07:23,280
properties
 

3867
01:07:23,280 --> 01:07:24,710
properties
oftentimes they fall in the zeroth

3868
01:07:24,710 --> 01:07:24,720
oftentimes they fall in the zeroth
 

3869
01:07:24,720 --> 01:07:27,109
oftentimes they fall in the zeroth
category and so

3870
01:07:27,109 --> 01:07:27,119
category and so
 

3871
01:07:27,119 --> 01:07:29,670
category and so
in thinking this through i i was wanting

3872
01:07:29,670 --> 01:07:29,680
in thinking this through i i was wanting
 

3873
01:07:29,680 --> 01:07:30,549
in thinking this through i i was wanting
to find a

3874
01:07:30,549 --> 01:07:30,559
to find a
 

3875
01:07:30,559 --> 01:07:32,630
to find a
quantitative structure on how to think

3876
01:07:32,630 --> 01:07:32,640
quantitative structure on how to think
 

3877
01:07:32,640 --> 01:07:33,990
quantitative structure on how to think
about

3878
01:07:33,990 --> 01:07:34,000
about
 

3879
01:07:34,000 --> 01:07:35,829
about
these zeroth principles and that's so i

3880
01:07:35,829 --> 01:07:35,839
these zeroth principles and that's so i
 

3881
01:07:35,839 --> 01:07:37,109
these zeroth principles and that's so i
came up with that

3882
01:07:37,109 --> 01:07:37,119
came up with that
 

3883
01:07:37,119 --> 01:07:40,230
came up with that
to be a coupler with first principle

3884
01:07:40,230 --> 01:07:40,240
to be a coupler with first principle
 

3885
01:07:40,240 --> 01:07:41,750
to be a coupler with first principle
thinking and so now it's a staple as

3886
01:07:41,750 --> 01:07:41,760
thinking and so now it's a staple as
 

3887
01:07:41,760 --> 01:07:43,190
thinking and so now it's a staple as
part of how i think about

3888
01:07:43,190 --> 01:07:43,200
part of how i think about
 

3889
01:07:43,200 --> 01:07:46,549
part of how i think about
the world in the future so it emphasizes

3890
01:07:46,549 --> 01:07:46,559
the world in the future so it emphasizes
 

3891
01:07:46,559 --> 01:07:47,510
the world in the future so it emphasizes
trying to identify

3892
01:07:47,510 --> 01:07:47,520
trying to identify
 

3893
01:07:47,520 --> 01:07:49,670
trying to identify
the lands on that word impossible like

3894
01:07:49,670 --> 01:07:49,680
the lands on that word impossible like
 

3895
01:07:49,680 --> 01:07:51,109
the lands on that word impossible like
what is impossible

3896
01:07:51,109 --> 01:07:51,119
what is impossible
 

3897
01:07:51,119 --> 01:07:53,829
what is impossible
essentially trying to identify what is

3898
01:07:53,829 --> 01:07:53,839
essentially trying to identify what is
 

3899
01:07:53,839 --> 01:07:55,510
essentially trying to identify what is
impossible and what is possible and

3900
01:07:55,510 --> 01:07:55,520
impossible and what is possible and
 

3901
01:07:55,520 --> 01:07:55,990
impossible and what is possible and
being

3902
01:07:55,990 --> 01:07:56,000
being
 

3903
01:07:56,000 --> 01:07:59,589
being
as how do you i mean

3904
01:07:59,589 --> 01:07:59,599
as how do you i mean
 

3905
01:07:59,599 --> 01:08:01,670
as how do you i mean
this this is the thing is most of

3906
01:08:01,670 --> 01:08:01,680
this this is the thing is most of
 

3907
01:08:01,680 --> 01:08:03,270
this this is the thing is most of
society tells you

3908
01:08:03,270 --> 01:08:03,280
society tells you
 

3909
01:08:03,280 --> 01:08:04,710
society tells you
the range of things they say is

3910
01:08:04,710 --> 01:08:04,720
the range of things they say is
 

3911
01:08:04,720 --> 01:08:06,789
the range of things they say is
impossible is very wide so you need to

3912
01:08:06,789 --> 01:08:06,799
impossible is very wide so you need to
 

3913
01:08:06,799 --> 01:08:07,910
impossible is very wide so you need to
be shrinking that

3914
01:08:07,910 --> 01:08:07,920
be shrinking that
 

3915
01:08:07,920 --> 01:08:10,789
be shrinking that
i mean that's the whole process of of

3916
01:08:10,789 --> 01:08:10,799
i mean that's the whole process of of
 

3917
01:08:10,799 --> 01:08:13,349
i mean that's the whole process of of
this kind of thinking is you need to

3918
01:08:13,349 --> 01:08:13,359
this kind of thinking is you need to
 

3919
01:08:13,359 --> 01:08:16,630
this kind of thinking is you need to
be very rigorous in in

3920
01:08:16,630 --> 01:08:16,640
be very rigorous in in
 

3921
01:08:16,640 --> 01:08:20,309
be very rigorous in in
trying to be trying to draw the lines of

3922
01:08:20,309 --> 01:08:20,319
trying to be trying to draw the lines of
 

3923
01:08:20,319 --> 01:08:22,070
trying to be trying to draw the lines of
what is actually impossible

3924
01:08:22,070 --> 01:08:22,080
what is actually impossible
 

3925
01:08:22,080 --> 01:08:25,030
what is actually impossible
because uh very few things are actually

3926
01:08:25,030 --> 01:08:25,040
because uh very few things are actually
 

3927
01:08:25,040 --> 01:08:26,229
because uh very few things are actually
impossible

3928
01:08:26,229 --> 01:08:26,239
impossible
 

3929
01:08:26,239 --> 01:08:29,269
impossible
i don't know what is actually impossible

3930
01:08:29,269 --> 01:08:29,279
i don't know what is actually impossible
 

3931
01:08:29,279 --> 01:08:31,669
i don't know what is actually impossible
like uh it's the joe rogan is entirely

3932
01:08:31,669 --> 01:08:31,679
like uh it's the joe rogan is entirely
 

3933
01:08:31,679 --> 01:08:32,789
like uh it's the joe rogan is entirely
possible

3934
01:08:32,789 --> 01:08:32,799
possible
 

3935
01:08:32,799 --> 01:08:36,229

i like that approach to uh to science

3936
01:08:36,229 --> 01:08:36,239
i like that approach to uh to science
 

3937
01:08:36,239 --> 01:08:39,110
i like that approach to uh to science
to engineering to entrepreneurship it's

3938
01:08:39,110 --> 01:08:39,120
to engineering to entrepreneurship it's
 

3939
01:08:39,120 --> 01:08:40,470
to engineering to entrepreneurship it's
entirely possible

01:08:40,480 --> 01:08:43,269
entirely possible
basically shrink the impossible to zero

3942
01:08:43,269 --> 01:08:43,279
basically shrink the impossible to zero
 

3943
01:08:43,279 --> 01:08:45,189
basically shrink the impossible to zero
to very small set

3944
01:08:45,189 --> 01:08:45,199
to very small set
 

3945
01:08:45,199 --> 01:08:48,950
to very small set
yeah life constraints favor

3946
01:08:48,950 --> 01:08:48,960
yeah life constraints favor
 

3947
01:08:48,960 --> 01:08:52,390
yeah life constraints favor
first principle thinking because it

3948
01:08:52,390 --> 01:08:52,400
first principle thinking because it
 

3949
01:08:52,400 --> 01:08:55,669
first principle thinking because it
it enables faster action with higher

3950
01:08:55,669 --> 01:08:55,679
it enables faster action with higher
 

3951
01:08:55,679 --> 01:08:57,510
it enables faster action with higher
probability of success

3952

pursuing zero with principal optionality

3954
01:09:00,789 --> 01:09:00,799
pursuing zero with principal optionality
 

3955
01:09:00,799 --> 01:09:01,749
pursuing zero with principal optionality
is expensive

3956
01:09:01,749 --> 01:09:01,759
is expensive
 

3957
01:09:01,759 --> 01:09:04,470
is expensive
and uncertain and so in a society

3958
01:09:04,470 --> 01:09:04,480
and uncertain and so in a society
 

3959
01:09:04,480 --> 01:09:06,070
and uncertain and so in a society
constrained by resources

3960
01:09:06,070 --> 01:09:06,080
constrained by resources

it minimizes zero principle thinking but

3966
01:09:14,470 --> 01:09:14,480
it minimizes zero principle thinking but
 

3967
01:09:14,480 --> 01:09:15,669
it minimizes zero principle thinking but
but the reason why i think

3968
01:09:15,669 --> 01:09:15,679
but the reason why i think
 

3969
01:09:15,679 --> 01:09:18,550
but the reason why i think
zeroth principle thinking should be a

3970
01:09:18,550 --> 01:09:18,560
zeroth principle thinking should be a
 

3971
01:09:18,560 --> 01:09:20,390
zeroth principle thinking should be a

01:09:23,669 --> 01:09:23,679
cognitive infrastructure is if you look
 

3975
01:09:23,679 --> 01:09:25,349
cognitive infrastructure is if you look
through the history of the past couple

3976
01:09:25,349 --> 01:09:25,359
through the history of the past couple
 

3977
01:09:25,359 --> 01:09:26,550
through the history of the past couple
thousand years and

3978
01:09:26,550 --> 01:09:26,560
thousand years and
 

3979
01:09:26,560 --> 01:09:29,829
thousand years and
let's just say we arbitrarily

3980
01:09:29,829 --> 01:09:29,839
let's just say we arbitrarily
 

3981
01:09:29,839 --> 01:09:31,990
let's just say we arbitrarily
we subjectively try to assess what is a

3982
01:09:31,990 --> 01:09:32,000
we subjectively try to assess what is a
 

3983
01:09:32,000 --> 01:09:34,550
we subjectively try to assess what is a
zero level zero level idea

3984
01:09:34,550 --> 01:09:34,560
zero level zero level idea
 

3985
01:09:34,560 --> 01:09:36,709
zero level zero level idea
and we say how many have occurred on

3986
01:09:36,709 --> 01:09:36,719
and we say how many have occurred on
 

3987
01:09:36,719 --> 01:09:37,749
and we say how many have occurred on
what time scales

3988
01:09:37,749 --> 01:09:37,759
what time scales
 

3989
01:09:37,759 --> 01:09:38,950
what time scales
and what were the contextual settings

3990
01:09:38,950 --> 01:09:38,960
and what were the contextual settings
 

3991
01:09:38,960 --> 01:09:40,789
and what were the contextual settings
for it i would argue

3992
01:09:40,789 --> 01:09:40,799
for it i would argue
 

3993
01:09:40,799 --> 01:09:44,630
for it i would argue
that if you look at alphago

3994
01:09:44,630 --> 01:09:44,640
that if you look at alphago
 

3995
01:09:44,640 --> 01:09:48,630
that if you look at alphago
when it played go from another dimension

3996
01:09:48,630 --> 01:09:48,640
when it played go from another dimension
 

3997
01:09:48,640 --> 01:09:51,910
when it played go from another dimension
with the the human go players when it

3998
01:09:51,910 --> 01:09:51,920
with the the human go players when it
 

3999
01:09:51,920 --> 01:09:53,349
with the the human go players when it
saw alphago's moves

4000
01:09:53,349 --> 01:09:53,359
saw alphago's moves
 

4001
01:09:53,359 --> 01:09:55,189
saw alphago's moves
it attributed it to like playing with an

4002
01:09:55,189 --> 01:09:55,199
it attributed it to like playing with an
 

4003
01:09:55,199 --> 01:09:56,790
it attributed it to like playing with an
alien playing

4004
01:09:56,790 --> 01:09:56,800
alien playing
 

4005
01:09:56,800 --> 01:09:58,709
alien playing
go with uh with alcohol being from

4006
01:09:58,709 --> 01:09:58,719
go with uh with alcohol being from
 

4007
01:09:58,719 --> 01:10:00,070
go with uh with alcohol being from
another dimension

4008
01:10:00,070 --> 01:10:00,080
another dimension
 

4009
01:10:00,080 --> 01:10:02,709
another dimension
and so if you say computational

4010
01:10:02,709 --> 01:10:02,719
and so if you say computational
 

4011
01:10:02,719 --> 01:10:04,390
and so if you say computational
intelligence

4012
01:10:04,390 --> 01:10:04,400
intelligence
 

4013
01:10:04,400 --> 01:10:07,030
intelligence
has an attribute of introducing

4014
01:10:07,030 --> 01:10:07,040
has an attribute of introducing
 

4015
01:10:07,040 --> 01:10:08,550
has an attribute of introducing
zero-like

4016
01:10:08,550 --> 01:10:08,560
zero-like
 

4017
01:10:08,560 --> 01:10:11,830
zero-like
insights then if you say

4018
01:10:11,830 --> 01:10:11,840
insights then if you say
 

4019
01:10:11,840 --> 01:10:14,790
insights then if you say
what is going to be the occurrence of

4020
01:10:14,790 --> 01:10:14,800
what is going to be the occurrence of
 

4021
01:10:14,800 --> 01:10:16,070
what is going to be the occurrence of
zeros in society

4022
01:10:16,070 --> 01:10:16,080
zeros in society
 

4023
01:10:16,080 --> 01:10:18,630
zeros in society
going forward and you could reasonably

4024
01:10:18,630 --> 01:10:18,640
going forward and you could reasonably
 

4025
01:10:18,640 --> 01:10:19,510
going forward and you could reasonably
say

4026
01:10:19,510 --> 01:10:19,520
say
 

4027
01:10:19,520 --> 01:10:21,350
say
probably a lot more than have occurred

4028
01:10:21,350 --> 01:10:21,360
probably a lot more than have occurred
 

4029
01:10:21,360 --> 01:10:23,990
probably a lot more than have occurred
and probably more at a faster pace

4030
01:10:23,990 --> 01:10:24,000
and probably more at a faster pace
 

4031
01:10:24,000 --> 01:10:25,990
and probably more at a faster pace
so then if you say what happens if you

4032
01:10:25,990 --> 01:10:26,000
so then if you say what happens if you
 

4033
01:10:26,000 --> 01:10:28,070
so then if you say what happens if you
have this computational intelligence

4034
01:10:28,070 --> 01:10:28,080
have this computational intelligence
 

4035
01:10:28,080 --> 01:10:30,310
have this computational intelligence
throughout society the manufacturing

4036
01:10:30,310 --> 01:10:30,320
throughout society the manufacturing
 

4037
01:10:30,320 --> 01:10:31,590
throughout society the manufacturing
design and distribution of intelligence

4038
01:10:31,590 --> 01:10:31,600
design and distribution of intelligence
 

4039
01:10:31,600 --> 01:10:33,669
design and distribution of intelligence
is now going to heading towards zero

4040
01:10:33,669 --> 01:10:33,679
is now going to heading towards zero
 

4041
01:10:33,679 --> 01:10:35,510
is now going to heading towards zero
you have an increased number of zeros

4042
01:10:35,510 --> 01:10:35,520
you have an increased number of zeros
 

4043
01:10:35,520 --> 01:10:37,110
you have an increased number of zeros
being produced

4044
01:10:37,110 --> 01:10:37,120
being produced
 

4045
01:10:37,120 --> 01:10:39,590

computers
 

4049
01:10:41,280 --> 01:10:43,590
computers
that's when i got to a point and said we

4050
01:10:43,590 --> 01:10:43,600
that's when i got to a point and said we
 

4051
01:10:43,600 --> 01:10:45,510
that's when i got to a point and said we
cannot predict the future

4052
01:10:45,510 --> 01:10:45,520
cannot predict the future
 

4053
01:10:45,520 --> 01:10:48,630
cannot predict the future
with first principles thinking we can't

01:10:48,630 --> 01:10:48,640
with first principles thinking we can't
 

4055
01:10:48,640 --> 01:10:50,550
with first principles thinking we can't
that cannot be our imagination set it

4056
01:10:50,550 --> 01:10:50,560
that cannot be our imagination set it
 

4057
01:10:50,560 --> 01:10:52,229
that cannot be our imagination set it
can't be

4058
01:10:52,229 --> 01:10:52,239
can't be
 

4059
01:10:52,239 --> 01:10:55,270
can't be
uh our sole anchor in this situation

4060
01:10:55,270 --> 01:10:55,280
uh our sole anchor in this situation
 

4061
01:10:55,280 --> 01:10:56,550
uh our sole anchor in this situation
that basically the future of our

4062
01:10:56,550 --> 01:10:56,560
that basically the future of our
 

4063
01:10:56,560 --> 01:10:59,189
that basically the future of our
conscious existence 20 30 40 50 years

4064
01:10:59,189 --> 01:10:59,199
conscious existence 20 30 40 50 years
 

4065
01:10:59,199 --> 01:11:02,870
conscious existence 20 30 40 50 years
is probably a zero

4066
01:11:02,870 --> 01:11:02,880
is probably a zero
 

4067
01:11:02,880 --> 01:11:06,470
is probably a zero
so just to clarify when you say

4068
01:11:06,470 --> 01:11:06,480
so just to clarify when you say
 

4069
01:11:06,480 --> 01:11:09,510
so just to clarify when you say
zero you're referring to basically

4070
01:11:09,510 --> 01:11:09,520
zero you're referring to basically
 

4071
01:11:09,520 --> 01:11:12,630
zero you're referring to basically
a truly revolutionary idea yeah

4072
01:11:12,630 --> 01:11:12,640
a truly revolutionary idea yeah
 

4073
01:11:12,640 --> 01:11:15,189
a truly revolutionary idea yeah
something that is currently not a

01:11:15,189 --> 01:11:15,199
something that is currently not a
 

4075
01:11:15,199 --> 01:11:16,950
something that is currently not a
building block

4076
01:11:16,950 --> 01:11:16,960
building block
 

4077
01:11:16,960 --> 01:11:19,990
building block
of our

4078
01:11:19,990 --> 01:11:20,000
of our
 

4079
01:11:20,000 --> 01:11:21,750
of our
shared conscious existence either in the

4080
01:11:21,750 --> 01:11:21,760
shared conscious existence either in the
 

4081
01:11:21,760 --> 01:11:23,750
shared conscious existence either in the
form of knowledge

4082
01:11:23,750 --> 01:11:23,760
form of knowledge
 

4083
01:11:23,760 --> 01:11:26,550
form of knowledge
uh yeah it's currently not manifest yeah

4084
01:11:26,550 --> 01:11:26,560
uh yeah it's currently not manifest yeah
 

4085
01:11:26,560 --> 01:11:27,830
uh yeah it's currently not manifest yeah
in what we

4086
01:11:27,830 --> 01:11:27,840
in what we
 

4087
01:11:27,840 --> 01:11:30,709
in what we
acknowledge so zeroth principle thinking

4088
01:11:30,709 --> 01:11:30,719
acknowledge so zeroth principle thinking
 

4089
01:11:30,719 --> 01:11:31,270
acknowledge so zeroth principle thinking
is

4090
01:11:31,270 --> 01:11:31,280
is
 

4091
01:11:31,280 --> 01:11:34,470
is
playing with ideas that are so

4092
01:11:34,470 --> 01:11:34,480
playing with ideas that are so
 

4093
01:11:34,480 --> 01:11:38,229
playing with ideas that are so
revolutionary that we can't even

4094
01:11:38,229 --> 01:11:38,239
revolutionary that we can't even
 

4095
01:11:38,239 --> 01:11:40,310
revolutionary that we can't even
clearly reason about the consequences

4096
01:11:40,310 --> 01:11:40,320
clearly reason about the consequences
 

4097
01:11:40,320 --> 01:11:41,830
clearly reason about the consequences
once those ideas come to be

4098
01:11:41,830 --> 01:11:41,840
once those ideas come to be
 

4099
01:11:41,840 --> 01:11:45,990
once those ideas come to be
yeah or for example like einstein

4100
01:11:45,990 --> 01:11:46,000

 

4101
01:11:46,000 --> 01:11:49,350

that was a zeroth i would categorize it

4102
01:11:49,350 --> 01:11:49,360
that was a zeroth i would categorize it
 

4103
01:11:49,360 --> 01:11:50,550
that was a zeroth i would categorize it
as a zeroth principle

4104
01:11:50,550 --> 01:11:50,560
as a zeroth principle
 

4105
01:11:50,560 --> 01:11:52,870
as a zeroth principle
insight you mean generality space time

4106
01:11:52,870 --> 01:11:52,880
insight you mean generality space time
 

4107
01:11:52,880 --> 01:11:55,110
insight you mean generality space time
yeah

4108
01:11:55,110 --> 01:11:55,120
yeah
 

4109
01:11:55,120 --> 01:11:58,709
yeah
basically building upon what newton had

4110
01:11:58,709 --> 01:11:58,719
basically building upon what newton had
 

4111
01:11:58,719 --> 01:12:00,390
basically building upon what newton had
done and said

4112
01:12:00,390 --> 01:12:00,400
done and said
 

4113
01:12:00,400 --> 01:12:04,390
done and said
yes also and it just changed the

4114
01:12:04,390 --> 01:12:04,400
yes also and it just changed the
 

4115
01:12:04,400 --> 01:12:06,630
yes also and it just changed the
fabric of our understanding of reality

4116
01:12:06,630 --> 01:12:06,640
fabric of our understanding of reality
 

4117
01:12:06,640 --> 01:12:07,990
fabric of our understanding of reality
and so that was unexpected

4118
01:12:07,990 --> 01:12:08,000
and so that was unexpected
 

4119
01:12:08,000 --> 01:12:11,350
and so that was unexpected
it existed we just uh it became

4120
01:12:11,350 --> 01:12:11,360
it existed we just uh it became
 

4121
01:12:11,360 --> 01:12:13,510
it existed we just uh it became
it came part of our awareness and the

4122
01:12:13,510 --> 01:12:13,520
it came part of our awareness and the
 

4123
01:12:13,520 --> 01:12:15,270
it came part of our awareness and the
moves alpha go made

4124
01:12:15,270 --> 01:12:15,280
moves alpha go made
 

4125
01:12:15,280 --> 01:12:18,950
moves alpha go made
existed it just came into our awareness

4126
01:12:18,950 --> 01:12:18,960
existed it just came into our awareness
 

4127
01:12:18,960 --> 01:12:21,990
existed it just came into our awareness
and so it to your point

4128
01:12:21,990 --> 01:12:22,000
and so it to your point
 

4129
01:12:22,000 --> 01:12:25,430
and so it to your point
there's this question of

4130
01:12:25,430 --> 01:12:25,440
there's this question of
 

4131
01:12:25,440 --> 01:12:28,310
there's this question of
what do we know and what don't we know

4132
01:12:28,310 --> 01:12:28,320
what do we know and what don't we know
 

4133
01:12:28,320 --> 01:12:29,830
what do we know and what don't we know
do we think we know 99

4134
01:12:29,830 --> 01:12:29,840
do we think we know 99
 

4135
01:12:29,840 --> 01:12:31,750
do we think we know 99
of all things or do we think we know

4136
01:12:31,750 --> 01:12:31,760
of all things or do we think we know
 

4137
01:12:31,760 --> 01:12:32,870
of all things or do we think we know
0.001

4138
01:12:32,870 --> 01:12:32,880
0.001
 

4139
01:12:32,880 --> 01:12:35,350
0.001
of all things and that goes back to no

4140
01:12:35,350 --> 01:12:35,360
of all things and that goes back to no
 

4141
01:12:35,360 --> 01:12:37,270
of all things and that goes back to no
no no knowns and unknown unknowns

4142
01:12:37,270 --> 01:12:37,280
no no knowns and unknown unknowns
 

4143
01:12:37,280 --> 01:12:38,790
no no knowns and unknown unknowns
and first principles and zero principle

4144
01:12:38,790 --> 01:12:38,800
and first principles and zero principle
 

4145
01:12:38,800 --> 01:12:40,950
and first principles and zero principle
thinking gives us a quantitative

4146
01:12:40,950 --> 01:12:40,960
thinking gives us a quantitative
 

4147
01:12:40,960 --> 01:12:42,550
thinking gives us a quantitative
framework to say

4148
01:12:42,550 --> 01:12:42,560
framework to say
 

4149
01:12:42,560 --> 01:12:45,110
framework to say
there's no way for us to mathematically

4150
01:12:45,110 --> 01:12:45,120
there's no way for us to mathematically
 

4151
01:12:45,120 --> 01:12:46,470
there's no way for us to mathematically
try to create probabilities for these

4152
01:12:46,470 --> 01:12:46,480
try to create probabilities for these
 

4153
01:12:46,480 --> 01:12:47,590
try to create probabilities for these
things

4154
01:12:47,590 --> 01:12:47,600
things
 

4155
01:12:47,600 --> 01:12:50,790
things
therefore it would be helpful if they

4156
01:12:50,790 --> 01:12:50,800
therefore it would be helpful if they
 

4157
01:12:50,800 --> 01:12:52,149
therefore it would be helpful if they
were just part of our standard thought

4158
01:12:52,149 --> 01:12:52,159
were just part of our standard thought
 

4159
01:12:52,159 --> 01:12:53,350
were just part of our standard thought
processes

4160
01:12:53,350 --> 01:12:53,360
processes
 

4161
01:12:53,360 --> 01:12:56,870
processes
because it may encourage different

4162
01:12:56,870 --> 01:12:56,880
because it may encourage different
 

4163
01:12:56,880 --> 01:13:00,070
because it may encourage different
behaviors in what we do individually

4164
01:13:00,070 --> 01:13:00,080
behaviors in what we do individually
 

4165
01:13:00,080 --> 01:13:01,830
behaviors in what we do individually
collectively as a society what we aspire

4166
01:13:01,830 --> 01:13:01,840
collectively as a society what we aspire
 

4167
01:13:01,840 --> 01:13:03,350
collectively as a society what we aspire
to what we talk about

4168
01:13:03,350 --> 01:13:03,360
to what we talk about
 

4169
01:13:03,360 --> 01:13:05,830
to what we talk about
the possibility sets we imagine yeah

4170
01:13:05,830 --> 01:13:05,840
the possibility sets we imagine yeah
 

4171
01:13:05,840 --> 01:13:06,630
the possibility sets we imagine yeah
i've been

4172
01:13:06,630 --> 01:13:06,640
i've been
 

4173
01:13:06,640 --> 01:13:09,030
i've been
engaged in that kind of thinking uh

4174
01:13:09,030 --> 01:13:09,040
engaged in that kind of thinking uh
 

4175
01:13:09,040 --> 01:13:11,110
engaged in that kind of thinking uh
quite a bit

4176
01:13:11,110 --> 01:13:11,120
quite a bit
 

4177
01:13:11,120 --> 01:13:12,950
quite a bit
and thinking about engineering of

4178
01:13:12,950 --> 01:13:12,960
and thinking about engineering of
 

4179
01:13:12,960 --> 01:13:14,390
and thinking about engineering of
consciousness

4180
01:13:14,390 --> 01:13:14,400
consciousness
 

4181
01:13:14,400 --> 01:13:16,630
consciousness
i think it's feasible i think it's

4182
01:13:16,630 --> 01:13:16,640
i think it's feasible i think it's
 

4183
01:13:16,640 --> 01:13:18,149
i think it's feasible i think it's
possible in the language that we're

4184
01:13:18,149 --> 01:13:18,159
possible in the language that we're
 

4185
01:13:18,159 --> 01:13:19,189
possible in the language that we're
using here

4186
01:13:19,189 --> 01:13:19,199
using here
 

4187
01:13:19,199 --> 01:13:21,030
using here
it's very difficult to reason about a

4188
01:13:21,030 --> 01:13:21,040
it's very difficult to reason about a
 

4189
01:13:21,040 --> 01:13:22,709
it's very difficult to reason about a
world

4190
01:13:22,709 --> 01:13:22,719
world
 

4191
01:13:22,719 --> 01:13:25,990
world
when inklings of consciousness can be

4192
01:13:25,990 --> 01:13:26,000
when inklings of consciousness can be
 

4193
01:13:26,000 --> 01:13:26,790
when inklings of consciousness can be
engineered

4194
01:13:26,790 --> 01:13:26,800
engineered
 

4195
01:13:26,800 --> 01:13:31,030
engineered
into uh artificial systems

4196
01:13:31,030 --> 01:13:31,040
into uh artificial systems
 

4197
01:13:31,040 --> 01:13:33,510
into uh artificial systems
not from a philosophical perspective but

4198
01:13:33,510 --> 01:13:33,520
not from a philosophical perspective but
 

4199
01:13:33,520 --> 01:13:35,510
not from a philosophical perspective but
from an engineering perspective

4200
01:13:35,510 --> 01:13:35,520
from an engineering perspective
 

4201
01:13:35,520 --> 01:13:37,510
from an engineering perspective
i believe a good step towards

4202
01:13:37,510 --> 01:13:37,520
i believe a good step towards
 

4203
01:13:37,520 --> 01:13:39,669
i believe a good step towards
engineering consciousness

4204
01:13:39,669 --> 01:13:39,679
engineering consciousness
 

4205
01:13:39,679 --> 01:13:42,870
engineering consciousness
is is creating engineering the

4206
01:13:42,870 --> 01:13:42,880
is is creating engineering the
 

4207
01:13:42,880 --> 01:13:47,350
is is creating engineering the
illusion of consciousness i'm

4208
01:13:47,350 --> 01:13:47,360
illusion of consciousness i'm
 

4209
01:13:47,360 --> 01:13:51,830
illusion of consciousness i'm
captivated by our natural predisposition

4210
01:13:51,830 --> 01:13:51,840
captivated by our natural predisposition
 

4211
01:13:51,840 --> 01:13:55,110
captivated by our natural predisposition
to anthropomorphize things

4212
01:13:55,110 --> 01:13:55,120
to anthropomorphize things
 

4213
01:13:55,120 --> 01:13:58,630
to anthropomorphize things
and i think that's what we

4214
01:13:58,630 --> 01:13:58,640

 

4215
01:13:58,640 --> 01:13:59,910

i don't want to hear from the

4216
01:13:59,910 --> 01:13:59,920
i don't want to hear from the
 

4217
01:13:59,920 --> 01:14:02,149
i don't want to hear from the
philosophers but

4218
01:14:02,149 --> 01:14:02,159
philosophers but
 

4219
01:14:02,159 --> 01:14:03,910
philosophers but
i think that's what we kind of do to

4220
01:14:03,910 --> 01:14:03,920
i think that's what we kind of do to
 

4221
01:14:03,920 --> 01:14:05,510
i think that's what we kind of do to
each other okay

4222
01:14:05,510 --> 01:14:05,520
each other okay
 

4223
01:14:05,520 --> 01:14:08,630
each other okay
that consciousness is

4224
01:14:08,630 --> 01:14:08,640
that consciousness is
 

4225
01:14:08,640 --> 01:14:12,149
that consciousness is
created socially

4226
01:14:12,149 --> 01:14:12,159
created socially
 

4227
01:14:12,159 --> 01:14:14,630
created socially
that like much of the power of

4228
01:14:14,630 --> 01:14:14,640
that like much of the power of
 

4229
01:14:14,640 --> 01:14:15,990
that like much of the power of

4230
01:14:15,990 --> 01:14:16,000
consciousness
 

4231
01:14:16,000 --> 01:14:19,030
consciousness
is in the social interaction i create

4232
01:14:19,030 --> 01:14:19,040
is in the social interaction i create
 

4233
01:14:19,040 --> 01:14:22,070
is in the social interaction i create
your consciousness no i create my

4234
01:14:22,070 --> 01:14:22,080
your consciousness no i create my
 

4235
01:14:22,080 --> 01:14:23,990
your consciousness no i create my
consciousness by having interaction with

01:14:23,990 --> 01:14:24,000
consciousness by having interaction with
 

4237
01:14:24,000 --> 01:14:25,270
consciousness by having interaction with
you

4238
01:14:25,270 --> 01:14:25,280
you
 

4239
01:14:25,280 --> 01:14:27,030
you
and that that's the display of

4240
01:14:27,030 --> 01:14:27,040
and that that's the display of
 

4241
01:14:27,040 --> 01:14:28,790
and that that's the display of
consciousness it's the same as like the

4242

consciousness it's the same as like the
 

4243
01:14:28,800 --> 01:14:29,910
consciousness it's the same as like the

like feeding

4270
01:14:54,550 --> 01:14:54,560
like feeding
 

4271
01:14:54,560 --> 01:14:57,669
like feeding
this subjective experience to us as

4272
01:14:57,669 --> 01:14:57,679
this subjective experience to us as
 

4273
01:14:57,679 --> 01:14:58,709
this subjective experience to us as
opposed to

4274
01:14:58,709 --> 01:14:58,719
opposed to
 

4275
01:14:58,719 --> 01:15:02,149
opposed to
like it actually being an illusion that

4276
01:15:02,149 --> 01:15:02,159
like it actually being an illusion that
 

4277
01:15:02,159 --> 01:15:03,430
like it actually being an illusion that
would construct to make social

4278
01:15:03,430 --> 01:15:03,440
would construct to make social
 

4279
01:15:03,440 --> 01:15:05,350

communication more effective

4280
01:15:05,350 --> 01:15:05,360
communication more effective
 

4281
01:15:05,360 --> 01:15:08,470
communication more effective
and so i think if you focus on

4282
01:15:08,470 --> 01:15:08,480
and so i think if you focus on
 

4283
01:15:08,480 --> 01:15:10,470
and so i think if you focus on
creating the illusion of consciousness

4284
01:15:10,470 --> 01:15:10,480
creating the illusion of consciousness
 

4285
01:15:10,480 --> 01:15:11,990
creating the illusion of consciousness
you can create some very fulfilling

4286
01:15:11,990 --> 01:15:12,000
you can create some very fulfilling
 

4287
01:15:12,000 --> 01:15:13,270
you can create some very fulfilling
experiences

4288
01:15:13,270 --> 01:15:13,280

4295
01:15:19,120 --> 01:15:20,229

you and i think

4296
01:15:20,229 --> 01:15:20,239
you and i think
 

4297
01:15:20,239 --> 01:15:21,590

going back to our experience together
with brain interfaces on you could

if we get to a certain level of maturity
 

4305
01:15:25,920 --> 01:15:27,669
if we get to a certain level of maturity
so first let's take

4306
01:15:27,669 --> 01:15:27,679
so first let's take
 

4307
01:15:27,679 --> 01:15:29,590
so first let's take
the the inverse of this so you and i

4308
01:15:29,590 --> 01:15:29,600
the the inverse of this so you and i

the the inverse of this so you and i
text back and forth and we're sending

with each other
and so in our communication with people

4320
01:15:41,189 --> 01:15:41,199
and so in our communication with people
 

4321
01:15:41,199 --> 01:15:43,189
and so in our communication with people
via email and text and whatnot we've

via email and text and whatnot we've
 

4323
01:15:43,199 --> 01:15:46,709
via email and text and whatnot we've
taken the bandwidth of human interaction

4324
01:15:46,709 --> 01:15:46,719
taken the bandwidth of human interaction
 

4325
01:15:46,719 --> 01:15:48,149
taken the bandwidth of human interaction
the information transfer rate and we've

4326
01:15:48,149 --> 01:15:48,159
the information transfer rate and we've
 

4327
01:15:48,159 --> 01:15:49,830
the information transfer rate and we've
reduced it

4328
01:15:49,830 --> 01:15:49,840
reduced it
 

4329
01:15:49,840 --> 01:15:51,990
reduced it
we have less social cues we have less

4330
01:15:51,990 --> 01:15:52,000
we have less social cues we have less
 

4331
01:15:52,000 --> 01:15:53,510
we have less social cues we have less
information to work with there's a lot

4332
01:15:53,510 --> 01:15:53,520
information to work with there's a lot
 

4333
01:15:53,520 --> 01:15:55,189
information to work with there's a lot
more opportunity for misunderstanding

more opportunity for misunderstanding
so that is altering the conscious

4336
01:15:57,030 --> 01:15:57,040
so that is altering the conscious
 

4337
01:15:57,040 --> 01:15:59,350
so that is altering the conscious

so maybe i understand your hap when you
 

4353
01:16:15,280 --> 01:16:16,310
so maybe i understand your hap when you
look at the cup

look at the cup
 

4355
01:16:16,320 --> 01:16:17,669
look at the cup
and you experience that happiness you

4356
01:16:17,669 --> 01:16:17,679
and you experience that happiness you
 

4357
01:16:17,679 --> 01:16:19,510
and you experience that happiness you
can tell me you're happy and i then do

4358
01:16:19,510 --> 01:16:19,520
can tell me you're happy and i then do
 

4359
01:16:19,520 --> 01:16:20,470
can tell me you're happy and i then do

in how we go about doing it which to me

4414
01:17:07,669 --> 01:17:07,679
in how we go about doing it which to me
 

4415
01:17:07,679 --> 01:17:09,990
in how we go about doing it which to me
i find encouraging because

4416
01:17:09,990 --> 01:17:10,000
i find encouraging because
 

4417
01:17:10,000 --> 01:17:14,229
i find encouraging because
i think it creates better guardrails for

4418
01:17:14,229 --> 01:17:14,239
i think it creates better guardrails for
 

4419
01:17:14,239 --> 01:17:17,270
i think it creates better guardrails for
to create uh ethical systems

4420
01:17:17,270 --> 01:17:17,280
to create uh ethical systems
 

4421
01:17:17,280 --> 01:17:19,669
to create uh ethical systems
on versus right now i feel like it's

4422
01:17:19,669 --> 01:17:19,679
on versus right now i feel like it's
 

4423
01:17:19,679 --> 01:17:21,110
on versus right now i feel like it's
really wild wild west

yeah and it's funny you focus on human

4428
01:17:25,030 --> 01:17:25,040
yeah and it's funny you focus on human
 

4429
01:17:25,040 --> 01:17:25,990
yeah and it's funny you focus on human

the one of the concerns that people have
in this modern world the digital data is

in this modern world the digital data is
 

4541
01:19:29,600 --> 01:19:31,830
in this modern world the digital data is
that of privacy and security

4542

that of privacy and security
 

4543
01:19:31,840 --> 01:19:34,229
that of privacy and security
but privacy you know they're concerned

4544
01:19:34,229 --> 01:19:34,239
but privacy you know they're concerned
 

4545
01:19:34,239 --> 01:19:35,110
but privacy you know they're concerned
that when they share

4546
01:19:35,110 --> 01:19:35,120
that when they share
 

4547
01:19:35,120 --> 01:19:38,870
that when they share
data it's the same thing we feel when we

4548
01:19:38,870 --> 01:19:38,880
data it's the same thing we feel when we
 

4549
01:19:38,880 --> 01:19:39,270
data it's the same thing we feel when we
are

we're vulnerable
 

4557
01:19:46,159 --> 01:19:49,189
we're vulnerable
vulnerable about there's a there's a

4558
01:19:49,189 --> 01:19:49,199
vulnerable about there's a there's a
 

4559
01:19:49,199 --> 01:19:51,990
vulnerable about there's a there's a
leap of faith there's a leap of trust

4560
01:19:51,990 --> 01:19:52,000
leap of faith there's a leap of trust
 

4561
01:19:52,000 --> 01:19:54,149
leap of faith there's a leap of trust
that that's going to be just between us

4562
01:19:54,149 --> 01:19:54,159
that that's going to be just between us
 

4563
01:19:54,159 --> 01:19:55,990
that that's going to be just between us
as a privacy to it and then

4564
01:19:55,990 --> 01:19:56,000
as a privacy to it and then
 

4565
01:19:56,000 --> 01:19:57,430
as a privacy to it and then
the challenge is when you're in the

4566
01:19:57,430 --> 01:19:57,440
the challenge is when you're in the
 

4567
01:19:57,440 --> 01:20:00,070
the challenge is when you're in the
digital space then sharing your data

4568
01:20:00,070 --> 01:20:00,080
digital space then sharing your data
 

4569
01:20:00,080 --> 01:20:02,950
digital space then sharing your data
with companies that use that data for

4570
01:20:02,950 --> 01:20:02,960
with companies that use that data for
 

4571
01:20:02,960 --> 01:20:05,030
with companies that use that data for
advertisement all those kinds of things

4572
01:20:05,030 --> 01:20:05,040
advertisement all those kinds of things
 

4573
01:20:05,040 --> 01:20:07,910
advertisement all those kinds of things
there's a hesitancy to share that much

4574
01:20:07,910 --> 01:20:07,920
there's a hesitancy to share that much
 

4575
01:20:07,920 --> 01:20:08,390
there's a hesitancy to share that much
data

4576
01:20:08,390 --> 01:20:08,400
data
 

4577
01:20:08,400 --> 01:20:10,870
data
to share a lot of deep personal data and

4578
01:20:10,870 --> 01:20:10,880
to share a lot of deep personal data and
 

4579
01:20:10,880 --> 01:20:12,709
to share a lot of deep personal data and
if you look at brain data

4580
01:20:12,709 --> 01:20:12,719
if you look at brain data
 

4581
01:20:12,719 --> 01:20:16,070
if you look at brain data
that feels a whole lot like it's richly

4582
01:20:16,070 --> 01:20:16,080
that feels a whole lot like it's richly
 

4583
01:20:16,080 --> 01:20:18,229
that feels a whole lot like it's richly
deeply personal data so how do you think

4584
01:20:18,229 --> 01:20:18,239
deeply personal data so how do you think
 

4585
01:20:18,239 --> 01:20:19,990
deeply personal data so how do you think
about privacy

4586
01:20:19,990 --> 01:20:20,000
about privacy
 

4587
01:20:20,000 --> 01:20:22,390
about privacy
with this kind of ocean of data i think

4588
01:20:22,390 --> 01:20:22,400
with this kind of ocean of data i think
 

4589
01:20:22,400 --> 01:20:23,110
with this kind of ocean of data i think
we got off

4590
01:20:23,110 --> 01:20:23,120
we got off
 

4591
01:20:23,120 --> 01:20:26,550
we got off
to a wrong start with the internet where

4592
01:20:26,550 --> 01:20:26,560
to a wrong start with the internet where

if you're a company you can go out and

4598
01:20:36,149 --> 01:20:36,159
if you're a company you can go out and
 

4599
01:20:36,159 --> 01:20:39,110
if you're a company you can go out and
get as much information on a person

4600
01:20:39,110 --> 01:20:39,120
get as much information on a person
 

4601

approval and you can also do things to
 

4605
01:20:44,880 --> 01:20:46,229
approval and you can also do things to
induce them

4606
01:20:46,229 --> 01:20:46,239
induce them
 

4607
01:20:46,239 --> 01:20:48,709
induce them
to give you as much information and you

4608
01:20:48,709 --> 01:20:48,719
to give you as much information and you
 

4609
01:20:48,719 --> 01:20:49,590
to give you as much information and you
don't need to tell them what you're

4610
01:20:49,590 --> 01:20:49,600
don't need to tell them what you're
 

4611

don't need to tell them what you're
doing with it

4612
01:20:50,870 --> 01:20:50,880
doing with it
 

4613
01:20:50,880 --> 01:20:52,310
doing with it
you can do anything on the back side you

4614
01:20:52,310 --> 01:20:52,320
you can do anything on the back side you
 

4615
01:20:52,320 --> 01:20:54,070
you can do anything on the back side you
can make money on it but

4616
01:20:54,070 --> 01:20:54,080
can make money on it but
 

4617
01:20:54,080 --> 01:20:55,830
can make money on it but
the game is who can acquire the most

4618
01:20:55,830 --> 01:20:55,840
the game is who can acquire the most
 

4619
01:20:55,840 --> 01:20:57,830
the game is who can acquire the most
information and devise the most clever

4620
01:20:57,830 --> 01:20:57,840
information and devise the most clever
 

4621
01:20:57,840 --> 01:20:58,870
information and devise the most clever
schemes

4622
01:20:58,870 --> 01:20:58,880
schemes
 

4623
01:20:58,880 --> 01:21:02,709
schemes
to do it that was a bad starting place

4624
01:21:02,709 --> 01:21:02,719
to do it that was a bad starting place
 

4625
01:21:02,719 --> 01:21:05,830
to do it that was a bad starting place
and so we are in this period where we

4626
01:21:05,830 --> 01:21:05,840
and so we are in this period where we
 

4627
01:21:05,840 --> 01:21:07,110
and so we are in this period where we
need to wreck we need to correct for

4628
01:21:07,110 --> 01:21:07,120
need to wreck we need to correct for
 

4629
01:21:07,120 --> 01:21:07,430
need to wreck we need to correct for
that

4630
01:21:07,430 --> 01:21:07,440
that
 

4631
01:21:07,440 --> 01:21:09,830
that
and we need to say first of all the

4632
01:21:09,830 --> 01:21:09,840
and we need to say first of all the
 

4633
01:21:09,840 --> 01:21:11,030
and we need to say first of all the
individual

4634
01:21:11,030 --> 01:21:11,040
individual

01:21:14,800 --> 01:21:16,310
always has control over their data
it's not a free-for-all it's not like a

4638
01:21:16,310 --> 01:21:16,320
it's not a free-for-all it's not like a
 

4639
01:21:16,320 --> 01:21:17,910
it's not a free-for-all it's not like a
game of hungry hippo but

4640
01:21:17,910 --> 01:21:17,920
game of hungry hippo but
 

4641
01:21:17,920 --> 01:21:19,430

they can just go out and grab as much as
 

4643
01:21:19,440 --> 01:21:21,510
they can just go out and grab as much as
they want so for example when your brain

01:21:21,510 --> 01:21:21,520
they want so for example when your brain

data was recorded today the first thing

4646
01:21:22,870 --> 01:21:22,880
data was recorded today the first thing
 

4647
01:21:22,880 --> 01:21:25,030
data was recorded today the first thing
we did in the kernel app was

4648
01:21:25,030 --> 01:21:25,040
we did in the kernel app was
 

4649
01:21:25,040 --> 01:21:27,990
we did in the kernel app was
you have control over your data and so

4650
01:21:27,990 --> 01:21:28,000
you have control over your data and so
 

4651
01:21:28,000 --> 01:21:29,270
you have control over your data and so
it's individual

4652
01:21:29,270 --> 01:21:29,280
it's individual
 

4653
01:21:29,280 --> 01:21:31,510
it's individual
consent it's individual control and then

4654
01:21:31,510 --> 01:21:31,520
consent it's individual control and then
 

4655
01:21:31,520 --> 01:21:33,189
consent it's individual control and then
you can build up on top of that

4656
01:21:33,189 --> 01:21:33,199
you can build up on top of that
 

4657
01:21:33,199 --> 01:21:35,669
you can build up on top of that
but it has to be based upon some clear

4658
01:21:35,669 --> 01:21:35,679
but it has to be based upon some clear
 

4659
01:21:35,679 --> 01:21:36,870
but it has to be based upon some clear
rules of play if

4660
01:21:36,870 --> 01:21:36,880
rules of play if
 

4661
01:21:36,880 --> 01:21:39,110
rules of play if
everyone knows what's being collected

4665
01:21:40,560 --> 01:21:42,229
they know what's being done with it
and the person has control over it so

4666
01:21:42,229 --> 01:21:42,239
and the person has control over it so
 

4667
01:21:42,239 --> 01:21:44,070
and the person has control over it so
transparency and control so

everybody knows what does control look

according to
 

4689
01:22:05,360 --> 01:22:08,310
according to
my neurom you know you could say you can

4690
01:22:08,310 --> 01:22:08,320
my neurom you know you could say you can
 

4691
01:22:08,320 --> 01:22:10,629
my neurom you know you could say you can
have access to this vector space model

4692
01:22:10,629 --> 01:22:10,639
have access to this vector space model
 

4693
01:22:10,639 --> 01:22:12,790
have access to this vector space model
but only for this duration of time and

4694
01:22:12,790 --> 01:22:12,800
but only for this duration of time and
 

4695
01:22:12,800 --> 01:22:14,149
but only for this duration of time and
uh and then you've got to

4696
01:22:14,149 --> 01:22:14,159
uh and then you've got to
 

4697
01:22:14,159 --> 01:22:15,910
uh and then you've got to
delete it we haven't gotten there to

4698
01:22:15,910 --> 01:22:15,920
delete it we haven't gotten there to
 

4699
01:22:15,920 --> 01:22:17,430
delete it we haven't gotten there to
that level of physician but these are

4700
01:22:17,430 --> 01:22:17,440
that level of physician but these are
 

4701
01:22:17,440 --> 01:22:19,430
that level of physician but these are
ideas we need to start talking about of

4702
01:22:19,430 --> 01:22:19,440
ideas we need to start talking about of
 

4703
01:22:19,440 --> 01:22:20,550
ideas we need to start talking about of
how do you how would you actually

4704
01:22:20,550 --> 01:22:20,560
how do you how would you actually
 

4705
01:22:20,560 --> 01:22:22,149
how do you how would you actually
structure permissions

4706
01:22:22,149 --> 01:22:22,159
structure permissions
 

4707
01:22:22,159 --> 01:22:25,030
structure permissions
yeah and i think it creates a much more

4708
01:22:25,030 --> 01:22:25,040
yeah and i think it creates a much more
 

4709
01:22:25,040 --> 01:22:27,189
yeah and i think it creates a much more
stable set

4710
01:22:27,189 --> 01:22:27,199
stable set
 

4711
01:22:27,199 --> 01:22:29,830
stable set
for society to build where we understand

some companies doing for their sole

4726
01:22:43,590 --> 01:22:43,600
some companies doing for their sole
 

4727
01:22:43,600 --> 01:22:44,470
some companies doing for their sole
benefit

4728
01:22:44,470 --> 01:22:44,480
benefit
 

4729
01:22:44,480 --> 01:22:46,070
benefit
and so hopefully we are going through a

4730
01:22:46,070 --> 01:22:46,080
and so hopefully we are going through a
 

4731
01:22:46,080 --> 01:22:47,510
and so hopefully we are going through a
process now where we're correcting for

4732
01:22:47,510 --> 01:22:47,520
process now where we're correcting for
 

4733
01:22:47,520 --> 01:22:50,870
process now where we're correcting for
these things and that

4734
01:22:50,870 --> 01:22:50,880

 

4735
01:22:50,880 --> 01:22:54,709

it can be an economy-wide shift that

4736
01:22:54,709 --> 01:22:54,719
it can be an economy-wide shift that
 

4737
01:22:54,719 --> 01:22:58,310
it can be an economy-wide shift that
because really these are

4738
01:22:58,310 --> 01:22:58,320

 

4739
01:22:58,320 --> 01:22:59,830

these are fundamentals we need to have

4740
01:22:59,830 --> 01:22:59,840
these are fundamentals we need to have
 

4741
01:22:59,840 --> 01:23:02,310
these are fundamentals we need to have
in place it's kind of fun to think about

4742
01:23:02,310 --> 01:23:02,320
in place it's kind of fun to think about
 

4743
01:23:02,320 --> 01:23:03,910
in place it's kind of fun to think about
like uh

4744
01:23:03,910 --> 01:23:03,920
like uh
 

4745
01:23:03,920 --> 01:23:06,470
like uh
in chrome when you install an extension

4746
01:23:06,470 --> 01:23:06,480
in chrome when you install an extension
 

4747
01:23:06,480 --> 01:23:07,990
in chrome when you install an extension
or like install an app it's

4748
01:23:07,990 --> 01:23:08,000
or like install an app it's
 

4749
01:23:08,000 --> 01:23:09,270
or like install an app it's
asking you like what permissions you're

4750
01:23:09,270 --> 01:23:09,280
asking you like what permissions you're
 

4751
01:23:09,280 --> 01:23:11,270
asking you like what permissions you're
willing to give and be cool if in the

4752
01:23:11,270 --> 01:23:11,280
willing to give and be cool if in the
 

4753
01:23:11,280 --> 01:23:12,790
willing to give and be cool if in the
future it says like

4754
01:23:12,790 --> 01:23:12,800
future it says like
 

4755
01:23:12,800 --> 01:23:16,790
future it says like
uh you can have access to my brain data

4756
01:23:16,790 --> 01:23:16,800
uh you can have access to my brain data
 

4757
01:23:16,800 --> 01:23:19,510
uh you can have access to my brain data
i mean and if it's it's not unimaginable

4758
01:23:19,510 --> 01:23:19,520
i mean and if it's it's not unimaginable
 

4759
01:23:19,520 --> 01:23:21,510
i mean and if it's it's not unimaginable
in the future

4760
01:23:21,510 --> 01:23:21,520
in the future
 

4761
01:23:21,520 --> 01:23:23,430
in the future
the big technology companies have built

4762
01:23:23,430 --> 01:23:23,440
the big technology companies have built
 

4763
01:23:23,440 --> 01:23:25,669
the big technology companies have built
a business based upon acquiring data

4764
01:23:25,669 --> 01:23:25,679
a business based upon acquiring data
 

4765
01:23:25,679 --> 01:23:27,030
a business based upon acquiring data
about you that they can then create you

4766
01:23:27,030 --> 01:23:27,040
about you that they can then create you
 

4767
01:23:27,040 --> 01:23:28,149
about you that they can then create you
a model of you and sell that

4768
01:23:28,149 --> 01:23:28,159
a model of you and sell that
 

4769
01:23:28,159 --> 01:23:29,350
a model of you and sell that
predictability

4770
01:23:29,350 --> 01:23:29,360
predictability
 

4771
01:23:29,360 --> 01:23:30,870
predictability
and so it's not unimaginable that you

4772
01:23:30,870 --> 01:23:30,880
and so it's not unimaginable that you
 

4773
01:23:30,880 --> 01:23:32,830
and so it's not unimaginable that you
will create with like kernel device for

4774
01:23:32,830 --> 01:23:32,840
will create with like kernel device for
 

4775
01:23:32,840 --> 01:23:34,149
will create with like kernel device for
example a

4776
01:23:34,149 --> 01:23:34,159
example a
 

4777
01:23:34,159 --> 01:23:36,310
example a
more reliable predictor of you than they

4778
01:23:36,310 --> 01:23:36,320
more reliable predictor of you than they
 

4779
01:23:36,320 --> 01:23:38,229
more reliable predictor of you than they
could and that they're asking you for

4780
01:23:38,229 --> 01:23:38,239
could and that they're asking you for
 

4781
01:23:38,239 --> 01:23:39,030
could and that they're asking you for
permission

4782
01:23:39,030 --> 01:23:39,040
permission
 

4783
01:23:39,040 --> 01:23:40,550
permission
to complete their objectives and you're

4784
01:23:40,550 --> 01:23:40,560
to complete their objectives and you're
 

4785
01:23:40,560 --> 01:23:41,990
to complete their objectives and you're
the one that gets to negotiate that with

4786
01:23:41,990 --> 01:23:42,000
the one that gets to negotiate that with
 

4787
01:23:42,000 --> 01:23:42,470
the one that gets to negotiate that with
them

4788
01:23:42,470 --> 01:23:42,480
them
 

4789
01:23:42,480 --> 01:23:45,110
them
and say sure but it's not un

4790
01:23:45,110 --> 01:23:45,120
and say sure but it's not un
 

4791
01:23:45,120 --> 01:23:46,470
and say sure but it's not un
unimaginable that might

4792
01:23:46,470 --> 01:23:46,480
unimaginable that might
 

4793
01:23:46,480 --> 01:23:50,470
unimaginable that might
be the case so there's a guy named elon

4794
01:23:50,470 --> 01:23:50,480
be the case so there's a guy named elon
 

4795
01:23:50,480 --> 01:23:51,590
be the case so there's a guy named elon
musk

4796
01:23:51,590 --> 01:23:51,600
musk
 

4797
01:23:51,600 --> 01:23:53,270
musk
and he has a company in one of the many

4798
01:23:53,270 --> 01:23:53,280
and he has a company in one of the many
 

4799
01:23:53,280 --> 01:23:55,270
and he has a company in one of the many
companies called neuralink

4800
01:23:55,270 --> 01:23:55,280
companies called neuralink
 

4801
01:23:55,280 --> 01:23:57,990
companies called neuralink
that has uh that's also excited about

4802
01:23:57,990 --> 01:23:58,000
that has uh that's also excited about
 

4803
01:23:58,000 --> 01:23:58,950
that has uh that's also excited about
the brain

4804
01:23:58,950 --> 01:23:58,960
the brain
 

4805
01:23:58,960 --> 01:24:00,870
the brain
so be interesting to hear your kind of

4806
01:24:00,870 --> 01:24:00,880
so be interesting to hear your kind of
 

4807
01:24:00,880 --> 01:24:02,629
so be interesting to hear your kind of
opinions about a very different approach

4808
01:24:02,629 --> 01:24:02,639
opinions about a very different approach
 

4809
01:24:02,639 --> 01:24:03,669
opinions about a very different approach
that's invasive

4810
01:24:03,669 --> 01:24:03,679
that's invasive
 

4811
01:24:03,679 --> 01:24:06,790
that's invasive
that requires surgery that implants

4812
01:24:06,790 --> 01:24:06,800
that requires surgery that implants
 

4813
01:24:06,800 --> 01:24:08,870
that requires surgery that implants
a data collection device in the brain

4814
01:24:08,870 --> 01:24:08,880
a data collection device in the brain
 

4815
01:24:08,880 --> 01:24:10,070
a data collection device in the brain
how do you think about the difference

4816
01:24:10,070 --> 01:24:10,080
how do you think about the difference
 

4817
01:24:10,080 --> 01:24:11,669
how do you think about the difference
between kernel and neurolink

4818
01:24:11,669 --> 01:24:11,679
between kernel and neurolink
 

4819
01:24:11,679 --> 01:24:14,709
between kernel and neurolink
in the approaches of

4820
01:24:14,709 --> 01:24:14,719
in the approaches of
 

4821
01:24:14,719 --> 01:24:17,510
in the approaches of
getting that stream of brain data yeah

4822
01:24:17,510 --> 01:24:17,520
getting that stream of brain data yeah
 

4823
01:24:17,520 --> 01:24:18,629
getting that stream of brain data yeah
elon and i

4824
01:24:18,629 --> 01:24:18,639
elon and i
 

4825
01:24:18,639 --> 01:24:20,870
elon and i
spoke about this a lot early on we we

4826
01:24:20,870 --> 01:24:20,880
spoke about this a lot early on we we
 

4827
01:24:20,880 --> 01:24:23,030
spoke about this a lot early on we we
met up i had started colonel

4828
01:24:23,030 --> 01:24:23,040
met up i had started colonel
 

4829
01:24:23,040 --> 01:24:24,950
met up i had started colonel
and he had an interest in printer faces

4830
01:24:24,950 --> 01:24:24,960
and he had an interest in printer faces
 

4831
01:24:24,960 --> 01:24:27,430
and he had an interest in printer faces
as well and we explored

4832
01:24:27,430 --> 01:24:27,440
as well and we explored
 

4833
01:24:27,440 --> 01:24:28,629
as well and we explored
doing something together him joining

4834
01:24:28,629 --> 01:24:28,639
doing something together him joining
 

4835
01:24:28,639 --> 01:24:30,310
doing something together him joining
kernel and ultimately it wasn't the

4836
01:24:30,310 --> 01:24:30,320
kernel and ultimately it wasn't the
 

4837
01:24:30,320 --> 01:24:31,110
kernel and ultimately it wasn't the
right

4838
01:24:31,110 --> 01:24:31,120
right
 

4839
01:24:31,120 --> 01:24:33,590
right
move and so he started neural link and i

4840
01:24:33,590 --> 01:24:33,600
move and so he started neural link and i
 

4841
01:24:33,600 --> 01:24:35,189
move and so he started neural link and i
continued building colonel

4842
01:24:35,189 --> 01:24:35,199
continued building colonel
 

4843
01:24:35,199 --> 01:24:38,070
continued building colonel
but it was interesting because we were

4844
01:24:38,070 --> 01:24:38,080
but it was interesting because we were
 

4845
01:24:38,080 --> 01:24:39,030
but it was interesting because we were
both

4846
01:24:39,030 --> 01:24:39,040
both
 

4847
01:24:39,040 --> 01:24:44,550
both
at this very early time where it wasn't

4848
01:24:44,550 --> 01:24:44,560
at this very early time where it wasn't
 

4849
01:24:44,560 --> 01:24:46,950
at this very early time where it wasn't
certain what if there was a path to

4850
01:24:46,950 --> 01:24:46,960
certain what if there was a path to
 

4851
01:24:46,960 --> 01:24:48,950
certain what if there was a path to
pursue

4852
01:24:48,950 --> 01:24:48,960
pursue
 

4853
01:24:48,960 --> 01:24:50,229
pursue
if now was the right time to do

4854
01:24:50,229 --> 01:24:50,239
if now was the right time to do
 

4855
01:24:50,239 --> 01:24:52,229
if now was the right time to do
something and then the technological

4856
01:24:52,229 --> 01:24:52,239
something and then the technological
 

4857
01:24:52,239 --> 01:24:53,910
something and then the technological
choice of doing that and so

4858
01:24:53,910 --> 01:24:53,920
choice of doing that and so
 

4859
01:24:53,920 --> 01:24:55,990
choice of doing that and so
we were both our starting point was

4860
01:24:55,990 --> 01:24:56,000
we were both our starting point was
 

4861
01:24:56,000 --> 01:24:58,149
we were both our starting point was
looking at invasive technologies

4862
01:24:58,149 --> 01:24:58,159
looking at invasive technologies
 

4863
01:24:58,159 --> 01:25:00,149
looking at invasive technologies
and i was building invasive technology

4864
01:25:00,149 --> 01:25:00,159
and i was building invasive technology
 

4865
01:25:00,159 --> 01:25:01,270
and i was building invasive technology
at the time

4866
01:25:01,270 --> 01:25:01,280
at the time
 

4867
01:25:01,280 --> 01:25:04,870
at the time
that's ultimately where he's gone a

4868
01:25:04,870 --> 01:25:04,880
that's ultimately where he's gone a
 

4869
01:25:04,880 --> 01:25:07,590
that's ultimately where he's gone a
little less than a year after

4870
01:25:07,590 --> 01:25:07,600
little less than a year after
 

4871
01:25:07,600 --> 01:25:10,070
little less than a year after
elon and i were engaged i shifted kernel

4872
01:25:10,070 --> 01:25:10,080
elon and i were engaged i shifted kernel
 

4873
01:25:10,080 --> 01:25:12,390
elon and i were engaged i shifted kernel
to do non-invasive

4874
01:25:12,390 --> 01:25:12,400
to do non-invasive
 

4875
01:25:12,400 --> 01:25:14,790
to do non-invasive
and we had this neuroscientist come to

4876
01:25:14,790 --> 01:25:14,800
and we had this neuroscientist come to
 

4877
01:25:14,800 --> 01:25:16,070
and we had this neuroscientist come to
colonel we were talking about he had

4878
01:25:16,070 --> 01:25:16,080
colonel we were talking about he had
 

4879
01:25:16,080 --> 01:25:17,669
colonel we were talking about he had
been doing neurosurgery for 30 years one

4880
01:25:17,669 --> 01:25:17,679
been doing neurosurgery for 30 years one
 

4881
01:25:17,679 --> 01:25:19,189
been doing neurosurgery for 30 years one
of the most respected neuroscientists in

4882
01:25:19,189 --> 01:25:19,199
of the most respected neuroscientists in
 

4883
01:25:19,199 --> 01:25:20,070
of the most respected neuroscientists in
the us

4884
01:25:20,070 --> 01:25:20,080
the us
 

4885
01:25:20,080 --> 01:25:21,350
the us
and we brought him to colonel to figure

4886
01:25:21,350 --> 01:25:21,360
and we brought him to colonel to figure
 

4887
01:25:21,360 --> 01:25:23,430
and we brought him to colonel to figure

out the ins and outs of his profession
 

4889
01:25:23,440 --> 01:25:25,350
out the ins and outs of his profession
and at the very end of our three hour

4890
01:25:25,350 --> 01:25:25,360
and at the very end of our three hour
 

4891
01:25:25,360 --> 01:25:27,110
and at the very end of our three hour
conversation he said

01:25:27,110 --> 01:25:27,120
conversation he said
 

4893
01:25:27,120 --> 01:25:30,149
conversation he said
you know every 15 or so years

4894
01:25:30,149 --> 01:25:30,159
you know every 15 or so years
 

4895

a new technology comes along that
 

4897
01:25:32,880 --> 01:25:34,629
a new technology comes along that
changes everything

4898
01:25:34,629 --> 01:25:34,639
changes everything
 

4899
01:25:34,639 --> 01:25:37,350
changes everything
he said it's probably already here you

4900
01:25:37,350 --> 01:25:37,360
he said it's probably already here you
 

4901
01:25:37,360 --> 01:25:39,510
he said it's probably already here you
just can't see it yet

4902
01:25:39,510 --> 01:25:39,520
just can't see it yet
 

4903
01:25:39,520 --> 01:25:42,390
just can't see it yet
and my jaw dropped i thought because i i

4904
01:25:42,390 --> 01:25:42,400
and my jaw dropped i thought because i i

had spoken to bob greenberg

4906
01:25:44,470 --> 01:25:44,480
had spoken to bob greenberg
 

4907
01:25:44,480 --> 01:25:47,669
had spoken to bob greenberg
who had built a second site first on the

who had built a second site first on the
 

4909
01:25:47,679 --> 01:25:48,950
who had built a second site first on the
optical nerve and then he did court

01:25:48,950 --> 01:25:48,960
optical nerve and then he did court
 

4911
01:25:48,960 --> 01:25:52,550
optical nerve and then he did court
up an array on the optical

4912
01:25:52,550 --> 01:25:52,560
up an array on the optical
 

4913
01:25:52,560 --> 01:25:55,430
up an array on the optical
cortex and then i also became friendly

i saw in our in their eyes what it was
 

4925
01:26:07,199 --> 01:26:09,110
i saw in our in their eyes what it was
like to take something through an

for for a 15-year run they initially
 

4931
01:26:12,000 --> 01:26:13,590
for for a 15-year run they initially
thought of seven years

4932
01:26:13,590 --> 01:26:13,600
thought of seven years
 

4933
01:26:13,600 --> 01:26:15,189
thought of seven years
and ended up being 15 years and they

4934
01:26:15,189 --> 01:26:15,199
and ended up being 15 years and they
 

4935
01:26:15,199 --> 01:26:16,709
and ended up being 15 years and they
thought it'd be 100 million is you know

4936
01:26:16,709 --> 01:26:16,719
thought it'd be 100 million is you know

400 million and i really didn't want to

4940
01:26:20,790 --> 01:26:20,800
400 million and i really didn't want to
 

4941
01:26:20,800 --> 01:26:23,590
400 million and i really didn't want to
build invasive technology

4942
01:26:23,590 --> 01:26:23,600
build invasive technology
 

4943
01:26:23,600 --> 01:26:24,790
build invasive technology
it was the only thing that appeared to

4944
01:26:24,790 --> 01:26:24,800
it was the only thing that appeared to
 

4945
01:26:24,800 --> 01:26:27,350
it was the only thing that appeared to
be possible but then once

4946
01:26:27,350 --> 01:26:27,360
be possible but then once
 

4947
01:26:27,360 --> 01:26:28,870
be possible but then once
i spun up an internal effort to start

4948
01:26:28,870 --> 01:26:28,880
i spun up an internal effort to start
 

4949
01:26:28,880 --> 01:26:30,790
i spun up an internal effort to start
looking at non-invasive options we said

4950
01:26:30,790 --> 01:26:30,800
looking at non-invasive options we said
 

4951
01:26:30,800 --> 01:26:32,149
looking at non-invasive options we said
is there something here is there

4952
01:26:32,149 --> 01:26:32,159
is there something here is there
 

4953
01:26:32,159 --> 01:26:33,830
is there something here is there
anything here that again has the

4954
01:26:33,830 --> 01:26:33,840
anything here that again has the
 

4955
01:26:33,840 --> 01:26:35,590
anything here that again has the
characteristics of

4956
01:26:35,590 --> 01:26:35,600
characteristics of
 

4957
01:26:35,600 --> 01:26:37,750
characteristics of
it has the high quality data it could be

4958
01:26:37,750 --> 01:26:37,760
it has the high quality data it could be
 

4959
01:26:37,760 --> 01:26:39,510
it has the high quality data it could be
low-cost it could be accessible could it

4960
01:26:39,510 --> 01:26:39,520
low-cost it could be accessible could it
 

4961
01:26:39,520 --> 01:26:42,070
low-cost it could be accessible could it
make brain interfaces mainstream

4962
01:26:42,070 --> 01:26:42,080
make brain interfaces mainstream
 

4963
01:26:42,080 --> 01:26:43,990
make brain interfaces mainstream
and so i did a bet the company move we

4964
01:26:43,990 --> 01:26:44,000
and so i did a bet the company move we
 

4965
01:26:44,000 --> 01:26:46,149
and so i did a bet the company move we
shifted from non-invasive to

4966
01:26:46,149 --> 01:26:46,159
shifted from non-invasive to
 

4967
01:26:46,159 --> 01:26:47,990
shifted from non-invasive to
invasive to non-invasive so the answer

4968
01:26:47,990 --> 01:26:48,000
invasive to non-invasive so the answer
 

4969
01:26:48,000 --> 01:26:50,149
invasive to non-invasive so the answer
is yes to that there's something there

4970
01:26:50,149 --> 01:26:50,159
is yes to that there's something there
 

4971
01:26:50,159 --> 01:26:52,629
is yes to that there's something there
it's possible uh the answer is we'll see

4972
01:26:52,629 --> 01:26:52,639
it's possible uh the answer is we'll see
 

4973
01:26:52,639 --> 01:26:55,030
it's possible uh the answer is we'll see
we've now built both technologies

4974
01:26:55,030 --> 01:26:55,040
we've now built both technologies
 

4975
01:26:55,040 --> 01:26:56,950
we've now built both technologies
and they're now you experience one of

4976
01:26:56,950 --> 01:26:56,960
and they're now you experience one of
 

4977
01:26:56,960 --> 01:26:58,070
and they're now you experience one of
them today

4978
01:26:58,070 --> 01:26:58,080
them today
 

4979
01:26:58,080 --> 01:27:01,350
them today
we were applying

4980
01:27:01,350 --> 01:27:01,360
we were applying
 

4981
01:27:01,360 --> 01:27:02,870
we were applying
we're now deploying it so we're trying

4982
01:27:02,870 --> 01:27:02,880
we're now deploying it so we're trying
 

4983
01:27:02,880 --> 01:27:04,550
we're now deploying it so we're trying
to figure out what value is really there

4984
01:27:04,550 --> 01:27:04,560
to figure out what value is really there
 

4985
01:27:04,560 --> 01:27:06,550
to figure out what value is really there
but i'd say it's really too early to

4986
01:27:06,550 --> 01:27:06,560
but i'd say it's really too early to
 

4987
01:27:06,560 --> 01:27:07,669
but i'd say it's really too early to
express confidence

4988
01:27:07,669 --> 01:27:07,679
express confidence
 

4989
01:27:07,679 --> 01:27:09,910
express confidence
whether it's to i think it's too early

4990
01:27:09,910 --> 01:27:09,920
whether it's to i think it's too early
 

4991
01:27:09,920 --> 01:27:11,510
whether it's to i think it's too early
to

4992
01:27:11,510 --> 01:27:11,520
to
 

4993
01:27:11,520 --> 01:27:15,510
to
assess which technological choice

4994
01:27:15,510 --> 01:27:15,520
assess which technological choice
 

4995
01:27:15,520 --> 01:27:19,030
assess which technological choice
is the right one on what time skills

4996
01:27:19,030 --> 01:27:19,040
is the right one on what time skills
 

4997
01:27:19,040 --> 01:27:20,390
is the right one on what time skills
yeah time skills are really important

4998
01:27:20,390 --> 01:27:20,400
yeah time skills are really important
 

4999
01:27:20,400 --> 01:27:21,750
yeah time skills are really important
here very important because if you look

5000
01:27:21,750 --> 01:27:21,760
here very important because if you look
 

5001
01:27:21,760 --> 01:27:24,149
here very important because if you look
at the like on the invasive side

5002
01:27:24,149 --> 01:27:24,159
at the like on the invasive side
 

5003
01:27:24,159 --> 01:27:26,550
at the like on the invasive side
there's so much activity going on right

5004
01:27:26,550 --> 01:27:26,560
there's so much activity going on right
 

5005
01:27:26,560 --> 01:27:28,950
there's so much activity going on right
now of

5006
01:27:28,950 --> 01:27:28,960
now of
 

5007
01:27:28,960 --> 01:27:32,870
now of
less invasive techniques to get at

5008
01:27:32,870 --> 01:27:32,880
less invasive techniques to get at
 

5009
01:27:32,880 --> 01:27:35,350
less invasive techniques to get at
the neuron firings which would what

01:27:35,350 --> 01:27:35,360
the neuron firings which would what
 

5011
01:27:35,360 --> 01:27:36,790
the neuron firings which would what
neural link is building

neural link is building
 

5013
01:27:36,800 --> 01:27:39,830
neural link is building
it's possible that in 10 15 years when

5014
01:27:39,830 --> 01:27:39,840
it's possible that in 10 15 years when
 

5015
01:27:39,840 --> 01:27:41,110
it's possible that in 10 15 years when
they're scaling that technology other

5016
01:27:41,110 --> 01:27:41,120
they're scaling that technology other
 

5017
01:27:41,120 --> 01:27:42,310
they're scaling that technology other
things have come along

5018
01:27:42,310 --> 01:27:42,320
things have come along
 

5019
01:27:42,320 --> 01:27:44,550
things have come along
and you'd much rather do that that thing

5020
01:27:44,550 --> 01:27:44,560
and you'd much rather do that that thing
 

5021
01:27:44,560 --> 01:27:46,470
and you'd much rather do that that thing
starts to clock again

5022
01:27:46,470 --> 01:27:46,480
starts to clock again
 

5023
01:27:46,480 --> 01:27:47,750
starts to clock again
it may not be the case it may be the

5024
01:27:47,750 --> 01:27:47,760
it may not be the case it may be the
 

5025
01:27:47,760 --> 01:27:49,270
it may not be the case it may be the
case that neural link has properly

5026
01:27:49,270 --> 01:27:49,280
case that neural link has properly
 

5027
01:27:49,280 --> 01:27:50,709
case that neural link has properly
chosen the right technology

5028
01:27:50,709 --> 01:27:50,719
chosen the right technology
 

5029
01:27:50,719 --> 01:27:52,550
chosen the right technology
and that that's exactly what they want

5030
01:27:52,550 --> 01:27:52,560
and that that's exactly what they want
 

5031
01:27:52,560 --> 01:27:54,310
and that that's exactly what they want
to be totally possible and it's also

5032
01:27:54,310 --> 01:27:54,320
to be totally possible and it's also
 

5033
01:27:54,320 --> 01:27:55,669
to be totally possible and it's also
possible that the paths we've chosen are

5034
01:27:55,669 --> 01:27:55,679
possible that the paths we've chosen are
 

5035
01:27:55,679 --> 01:27:56,950
possible that the paths we've chosen are
non-invasive

5036
01:27:56,950 --> 01:27:56,960
non-invasive
 

5037
01:27:56,960 --> 01:27:58,629
non-invasive
fall short for a variety of reasons it's

5038
01:27:58,629 --> 01:27:58,639
fall short for a variety of reasons it's
 

5039
01:27:58,639 --> 01:28:00,470
fall short for a variety of reasons it's
just it's unknown

5040
01:28:00,470 --> 01:28:00,480
just it's unknown
 

5041
01:28:00,480 --> 01:28:02,629
just it's unknown
and so right now the two technologies we

5042
01:28:02,629 --> 01:28:02,639
and so right now the two technologies we
 

5043
01:28:02,639 --> 01:28:04,310
and so right now the two technologies we
chose the analogy i'd give to

5044
01:28:04,310 --> 01:28:04,320
chose the analogy i'd give to
 

5045
01:28:04,320 --> 01:28:06,310
chose the analogy i'd give to
give you to create a baseline of

5046
01:28:06,310 --> 01:28:06,320
give you to create a baseline of
 

5047
01:28:06,320 --> 01:28:08,070
give you to create a baseline of
understanding is

5048
01:28:08,070 --> 01:28:08,080
understanding is
 

5049
01:28:08,080 --> 01:28:09,750
understanding is
if you think of it like the internet in

5050
01:28:09,750 --> 01:28:09,760
if you think of it like the internet in
 

5051
01:28:09,760 --> 01:28:11,270
if you think of it like the internet in
the 90s

5052
01:28:11,270 --> 01:28:11,280
the 90s
 

5053
01:28:11,280 --> 01:28:13,430
the 90s
the internet became useful when people

5054
01:28:13,430 --> 01:28:13,440
the internet became useful when people
 

5055
01:28:13,440 --> 01:28:15,590
the internet became useful when people
could do a dial-up connection

5056
01:28:15,590 --> 01:28:15,600
could do a dial-up connection
 

5057
01:28:15,600 --> 01:28:18,229
could do a dial-up connection
and then the page and then as as

5058
01:28:18,229 --> 01:28:18,239
and then the page and then as as
 

5059
01:28:18,239 --> 01:28:19,270
and then the page and then as as
bandwidth increased

5060
01:28:19,270 --> 01:28:19,280
bandwidth increased
 

5061
01:28:19,280 --> 01:28:20,950
bandwidth increased
so did the utility of that connection

5062
01:28:20,950 --> 01:28:20,960
so did the utility of that connection
 

5063
01:28:20,960 --> 01:28:22,790
so did the utility of that connection
and so the ecosystem improve

5064
01:28:22,790 --> 01:28:22,800
and so the ecosystem improve
 

5065
01:28:22,800 --> 01:28:26,149
and so the ecosystem improve
and so if you say what kernel flow uh

5066
01:28:26,149 --> 01:28:26,159
and so if you say what kernel flow uh
 

5067
01:28:26,159 --> 01:28:28,870
and so if you say what kernel flow uh
is going to give you a full screen on

5068
01:28:28,870 --> 01:28:28,880
is going to give you a full screen on
 

5069
01:28:28,880 --> 01:28:29,430
is going to give you a full screen on
the picture

5070
01:28:29,430 --> 01:28:29,440
the picture
 

5071
01:28:29,440 --> 01:28:31,590
the picture
of information but as you're going to be

5072
01:28:31,590 --> 01:28:31,600
of information but as you're going to be
 

5073
01:28:31,600 --> 01:28:33,270
of information but as you're going to be
watching a movie but the image is going

5074
01:28:33,270 --> 01:28:33,280
watching a movie but the image is going
 

5075
01:28:33,280 --> 01:28:34,470
watching a movie but the image is going
to be blurred

5076
01:28:34,470 --> 01:28:34,480
to be blurred
 

5077
01:28:34,480 --> 01:28:37,590
to be blurred
and the audio is going to be muffled so

5078
01:28:37,590 --> 01:28:37,600
and the audio is going to be muffled so
 

5079
01:28:37,600 --> 01:28:40,629
and the audio is going to be muffled so
it has a lower resolution of coverage

5080
01:28:40,629 --> 01:28:40,639
it has a lower resolution of coverage
 

5081
01:28:40,639 --> 01:28:43,669
it has a lower resolution of coverage
kernel flux our amyg technology is going

5082
01:28:43,669 --> 01:28:43,679
kernel flux our amyg technology is going
 

5083
01:28:43,679 --> 01:28:44,950
kernel flux our amyg technology is going
to give you the full movie

5084
01:28:44,950 --> 01:28:44,960
to give you the full movie
 

5085
01:28:44,960 --> 01:28:48,149
to give you the full movie
in 1080p okay and

5086
01:28:48,149 --> 01:28:48,159
in 1080p okay and
 

5087
01:28:48,159 --> 01:28:51,510
in 1080p okay and
neuralink is going to give you a circle

5088
01:28:51,510 --> 01:28:51,520
neuralink is going to give you a circle
 

5089
01:28:51,520 --> 01:28:55,189
neuralink is going to give you a circle
on the screen of 4k okay

5090
01:28:55,189 --> 01:28:55,199
on the screen of 4k okay
 

5091
01:28:55,199 --> 01:28:57,669
on the screen of 4k okay
and so each one has their pros and cons

5092
01:28:57,669 --> 01:28:57,679
and so each one has their pros and cons
 

5093
01:28:57,679 --> 01:28:58,470
and so each one has their pros and cons
and

5094
01:28:58,470 --> 01:28:58,480
and
 

5095
01:28:58,480 --> 01:29:01,270
and
uh it's give and take and so the

5096
01:29:01,270 --> 01:29:01,280
uh it's give and take and so the
 

5097
01:29:01,280 --> 01:29:02,550
uh it's give and take and so the
decision i made

5098
01:29:02,550 --> 01:29:02,560
decision i made
 

5099
01:29:02,560 --> 01:29:04,149
decision i made
like kernel was that these two

5100
01:29:04,149 --> 01:29:04,159
like kernel was that these two
 

5101
01:29:04,159 --> 01:29:06,229
like kernel was that these two
technologies flux and flow

5102
01:29:06,229 --> 01:29:06,239
technologies flux and flow
 

5103
01:29:06,239 --> 01:29:09,110
technologies flux and flow
were basically the answer for the next

5104
01:29:09,110 --> 01:29:09,120
were basically the answer for the next
 

5105
01:29:09,120 --> 01:29:09,990
were basically the answer for the next
seven years

5106
01:29:09,990 --> 01:29:10,000
seven years
 

5107
01:29:10,000 --> 01:29:11,990
seven years
yeah and they would give rise to the

5108
01:29:11,990 --> 01:29:12,000
yeah and they would give rise to the
 

5109
01:29:12,000 --> 01:29:13,510
yeah and they would give rise to the
ecosystem which would become much more

5110
01:29:13,510 --> 01:29:13,520
ecosystem which would become much more
 

5111
01:29:13,520 --> 01:29:15,189
ecosystem which would become much more
valuable than the hardware itself

5112
01:29:15,189 --> 01:29:15,199
valuable than the hardware itself
 

5113
01:29:15,199 --> 01:29:16,229
valuable than the hardware itself
and that we would just continue to

5114
01:29:16,229 --> 01:29:16,239
and that we would just continue to
 

5115
01:29:16,239 --> 01:29:18,390
and that we would just continue to
improve on the hardware over time

5116
01:29:18,390 --> 01:29:18,400
improve on the hardware over time
 

5117
01:29:18,400 --> 01:29:20,870
improve on the hardware over time
and you know it's early days so it's

5118
01:29:20,870 --> 01:29:20,880
and you know it's early days so it's
 

5119
01:29:20,880 --> 01:29:23,430
and you know it's early days so it's
kind of fascinating to think about that

5120
01:29:23,430 --> 01:29:23,440
kind of fascinating to think about that
 

5121
01:29:23,440 --> 01:29:25,990
kind of fascinating to think about that
you don't it's very true that you don't

5122
01:29:25,990 --> 01:29:26,000
you don't it's very true that you don't
 

5123
01:29:26,000 --> 01:29:26,709
you don't it's very true that you don't
know

5124
01:29:26,709 --> 01:29:26,719
know
 

5125
01:29:26,719 --> 01:29:29,750
know
uh both paths are very prom

5126
01:29:29,750 --> 01:29:29,760
uh both paths are very prom
 

5127
01:29:29,760 --> 01:29:32,950
uh both paths are very prom
are promising

5128
01:29:32,950 --> 01:29:32,960

 

5129
01:29:32,960 --> 01:29:36,229

and it's like 50 years from now

5130
01:29:36,229 --> 01:29:36,239
and it's like 50 years from now
 

5131
01:29:36,239 --> 01:29:38,390
and it's like 50 years from now
we will look back and maybe not even

5132
01:29:38,390 --> 01:29:38,400
we will look back and maybe not even
 

5133
01:29:38,400 --> 01:29:40,709
we will look back and maybe not even
remember one of them

5134
01:29:40,709 --> 01:29:40,719
remember one of them
 

5135
01:29:40,719 --> 01:29:42,950
remember one of them
and the other one might change the world

5136
01:29:42,950 --> 01:29:42,960
and the other one might change the world
 

5137
01:29:42,960 --> 01:29:45,030
and the other one might change the world
it's so cool how technology is i mean

5138
01:29:45,030 --> 01:29:45,040
it's so cool how technology is i mean
 

5139
01:29:45,040 --> 01:29:45,350
it's so cool how technology is i mean
that's

5140
01:29:45,350 --> 01:29:45,360
that's
 

5141
01:29:45,360 --> 01:29:47,990
that's
that's what entrepreneurship is is like

5142
01:29:47,990 --> 01:29:48,000
that's what entrepreneurship is is like
 

5143
01:29:48,000 --> 01:29:48,790
that's what entrepreneurship is is like
mark it's the

5144
01:29:48,790 --> 01:29:48,800
mark it's the
 

5145
01:29:48,800 --> 01:29:50,470
mark it's the
the zeroth principle is like you're

5146
01:29:50,470 --> 01:29:50,480
the zeroth principle is like you're
 

5147
01:29:50,480 --> 01:29:52,470
the zeroth principle is like you're
marching ahead into the darkness into

5148
01:29:52,470 --> 01:29:52,480
marching ahead into the darkness into
 

5149
01:29:52,480 --> 01:29:53,590
marching ahead into the darkness into
the fog

5150
01:29:53,590 --> 01:29:53,600
the fog
 

5151
01:29:53,600 --> 01:29:55,510
the fog
not knowing it's wonderful to have

5152
01:29:55,510 --> 01:29:55,520
not knowing it's wonderful to have
 

5153
01:29:55,520 --> 01:29:57,110
not knowing it's wonderful to have
someone else out there with us

5154
01:29:57,110 --> 01:29:57,120
someone else out there with us
 

5155
01:29:57,120 --> 01:29:59,350
someone else out there with us
doing this because if you if you look at

5156
01:29:59,350 --> 01:29:59,360
doing this because if you if you look at
 

5157
01:29:59,360 --> 01:30:01,510
doing this because if you if you look at
brainerd faces

5158
01:30:01,510 --> 01:30:01,520
brainerd faces
 

5159
01:30:01,520 --> 01:30:05,270
brainerd faces
anything that's off the shelf right now

5160
01:30:05,270 --> 01:30:05,280
anything that's off the shelf right now
 

5161
01:30:05,280 --> 01:30:08,709
anything that's off the shelf right now
is inadequate it's had its run for

5162
01:30:08,709 --> 01:30:08,719
is inadequate it's had its run for
 

5163
01:30:08,719 --> 01:30:10,629
is inadequate it's had its run for
a couple decades it's still in hacker

5164
01:30:10,629 --> 01:30:10,639
a couple decades it's still in hacker
 

5165
01:30:10,639 --> 01:30:11,830
a couple decades it's still in hacker
communities it hasn't gone to the

5166
01:30:11,830 --> 01:30:11,840
communities it hasn't gone to the
 

5167
01:30:11,840 --> 01:30:14,790
communities it hasn't gone to the
mainstream

5168
01:30:14,790 --> 01:30:14,800

 

5169
01:30:14,800 --> 01:30:17,110

the room size machines are on their own

5170
01:30:17,110 --> 01:30:17,120
the room size machines are on their own
 

5171
01:30:17,120 --> 01:30:18,950
the room size machines are on their own
path

5172
01:30:18,950 --> 01:30:18,960
path
 

5173
01:30:18,960 --> 01:30:20,550
path
but there is no answer right now of

5174
01:30:20,550 --> 01:30:20,560
but there is no answer right now of
 

5175
01:30:20,560 --> 01:30:22,070
but there is no answer right now of
bringing brain interfaces

5176
01:30:22,070 --> 01:30:22,080
bringing brain interfaces
 

5177
01:30:22,080 --> 01:30:25,830
bringing brain interfaces
mainstream and so it both

5178
01:30:25,830 --> 01:30:25,840
mainstream and so it both
 

5179
01:30:25,840 --> 01:30:27,430
mainstream and so it both
you know both they and us we've both

5180
01:30:27,430 --> 01:30:27,440
you know both they and us we've both
 

5181
01:30:27,440 --> 01:30:29,510
you know both they and us we've both
spent over 100 million dollars

5182
01:30:29,510 --> 01:30:29,520
spent over 100 million dollars
 

5183
01:30:29,520 --> 01:30:31,830
spent over 100 million dollars
and that's kind of what it takes to have

5184
01:30:31,830 --> 01:30:31,840
and that's kind of what it takes to have
 

5185
01:30:31,840 --> 01:30:32,629
and that's kind of what it takes to have
a go at this

5186
01:30:32,629 --> 01:30:32,639
a go at this
 

5187
01:30:32,639 --> 01:30:34,790
a go at this
because you need to build full stack i

5188
01:30:34,790 --> 01:30:34,800
because you need to build full stack i
 

5189
01:30:34,800 --> 01:30:35,830
because you need to build full stack i
mean that kernel

5190
01:30:35,830 --> 01:30:35,840
mean that kernel

it's something like 36 37 phds

5198
01:30:45,030 --> 01:30:45,040
it's something like 36 37 phds
 

5199
01:30:45,040 --> 01:30:47,510
it's something like 36 37 phds
in these specialties these areas that

5200
01:30:47,510 --> 01:30:47,520
in these specialties these areas that
 

5201
01:30:47,520 --> 01:30:48,550
in these specialties these areas that
there's only a few people in the world

5202

there's only a few people in the world
 

5203
01:30:48,560 --> 01:30:50,149
there's only a few people in the world
who have these abilities

01:30:52,239 --> 01:30:53,990
and that's what it takes to build next
generation have to

5208
01:30:53,990 --> 01:30:54,000
generation have to
 

5209
01:30:54,000 --> 01:30:56,870
generation have to
make an attempt at breaking into brain

5210
01:30:56,870 --> 01:30:56,880
make an attempt at breaking into brain
 

5211
01:30:56,880 --> 01:30:58,390
make an attempt at breaking into brain
interfaces and so we'll see over the

5212
01:30:58,390 --> 01:30:58,400
interfaces and so we'll see over the
 

5213
01:30:58,400 --> 01:30:59,910
interfaces and so we'll see over the
couple years whether it's the right time

5214
01:30:59,910 --> 01:30:59,920
couple years whether it's the right time
 

5215
01:30:59,920 --> 01:31:01,590
couple years whether it's the right time
or whether we're both too early

5216
01:31:01,590 --> 01:31:01,600
or whether we're both too early
 

5217
01:31:01,600 --> 01:31:03,510
or whether we're both too early
or whether something else comes along in

5218
01:31:03,510 --> 01:31:03,520
or whether something else comes along in
 

5219
01:31:03,520 --> 01:31:05,430
or whether something else comes along in
seven to ten years which is the right

5220
01:31:05,430 --> 01:31:05,440
seven to ten years which is the right
 

5221
01:31:05,440 --> 01:31:08,149
seven to ten years which is the right
thing that brings it mainstream so you

5222
01:31:08,149 --> 01:31:08,159
thing that brings it mainstream so you
 

5223
01:31:08,159 --> 01:31:10,950
thing that brings it mainstream so you
see elon is the kind of competitor

5224
01:31:10,950 --> 01:31:10,960
see elon is the kind of competitor
 

5225
01:31:10,960 --> 01:31:14,709
see elon is the kind of competitor
or a fellow traveler

5226
01:31:14,709 --> 01:31:14,719
or a fellow traveler
 

5227
01:31:14,719 --> 01:31:16,790
or a fellow traveler
along the path of uncertainty or both

5228
01:31:16,790 --> 01:31:16,800
along the path of uncertainty or both
 

5229
01:31:16,800 --> 01:31:18,950
along the path of uncertainty or both
it's a fellow traveler

5230
01:31:18,950 --> 01:31:18,960
it's a fellow traveler
 

5231
01:31:18,960 --> 01:31:20,550
it's a fellow traveler
it's like at the beginning of the

5232
01:31:20,550 --> 01:31:20,560
it's like at the beginning of the
 

5233
01:31:20,560 --> 01:31:22,950
it's like at the beginning of the
internet is

01:31:22,950 --> 01:31:22,960
internet is
 

5235
01:31:22,960 --> 01:31:24,950
internet is
how many companies are going to be

5236
01:31:24,950 --> 01:31:24,960
how many companies are going to be
 

5237
01:31:24,960 --> 01:31:25,990
how many companies are going to be
invited to

5238
01:31:25,990 --> 01:31:26,000
invited to
 

5239
01:31:26,000 --> 01:31:29,270
invited to
this new ecosystem

5240
01:31:29,270 --> 01:31:29,280
this new ecosystem
 

5241
01:31:29,280 --> 01:31:30,870
this new ecosystem
like an endless number because if you

5242
01:31:30,870 --> 01:31:30,880
like an endless number because if you
 

5243
01:31:30,880 --> 01:31:33,350
like an endless number because if you
think that the hardware

5244
01:31:33,350 --> 01:31:33,360
think that the hardware
 

5245
01:31:33,360 --> 01:31:36,550
think that the hardware
just starts the process and so if you

5246
01:31:36,550 --> 01:31:36,560
just starts the process and so if you
 

5247
01:31:36,560 --> 01:31:38,070
just starts the process and so if you
okay back to your initial example if you

5248
01:31:38,070 --> 01:31:38,080
okay back to your initial example if you
 

5249
01:31:38,080 --> 01:31:39,750
okay back to your initial example if you
take the fitbit for example you say okay

5250
01:31:39,750 --> 01:31:39,760
take the fitbit for example you say okay
 

5251
01:31:39,760 --> 01:31:40,790
take the fitbit for example you say okay
now i can get

5252
01:31:40,790 --> 01:31:40,800
now i can get
 

5253
01:31:40,800 --> 01:31:43,750
now i can get
measurements on the body and what do we

5254
01:31:43,750 --> 01:31:43,760
measurements on the body and what do we
 

5255
01:31:43,760 --> 01:31:45,189
measurements on the body and what do we
think the ultimate value of this device

5256
01:31:45,189 --> 01:31:45,199
think the ultimate value of this device
 

5257
01:31:45,199 --> 01:31:46,390
think the ultimate value of this device
is going to be what is the information

5258
01:31:46,390 --> 01:31:46,400
is going to be what is the information
 

5259
01:31:46,400 --> 01:31:47,669
is going to be what is the information
transfer rate

two and a half billion dollars they
 

5269
01:31:54,000 --> 01:31:55,590
two and a half billion dollars they
didn't have ancillary value add there

5270
01:31:55,590 --> 01:31:55,600
didn't have ancillary value add there
 

5271
01:31:55,600 --> 01:31:57,430
didn't have ancillary value add there
weren't people building on top of

5272
01:31:57,430 --> 01:31:57,440
weren't people building on top of
 

5273
01:31:57,440 --> 01:31:59,669
weren't people building on top of
the fitbit device they also didn't have

5274
01:31:59,669 --> 01:31:59,679
the fitbit device they also didn't have
 

5275
01:31:59,679 --> 01:32:00,709
the fitbit device they also didn't have
increased

5276
01:32:00,709 --> 01:32:00,719
increased
 

5277
01:32:00,719 --> 01:32:02,470
increased
insight with additional data streams so

5278
01:32:02,470 --> 01:32:02,480
insight with additional data streams so
 

5279
01:32:02,480 --> 01:32:04,149
insight with additional data streams so
it's really just the device

5280
01:32:04,149 --> 01:32:04,159
it's really just the device
 

5281
01:32:04,159 --> 01:32:06,149
it's really just the device
if you look for example at apple and the

5282
01:32:06,149 --> 01:32:06,159
if you look for example at apple and the
 

5283
01:32:06,159 --> 01:32:07,990
if you look for example at apple and the
device they sell you have value in the

5284
01:32:07,990 --> 01:32:08,000
device they sell you have value in the
 

5285
01:32:08,000 --> 01:32:10,070
device they sell you have value in the
device that someone buys but also

5286
01:32:10,070 --> 01:32:10,080
device that someone buys but also
 

5287
01:32:10,080 --> 01:32:11,430
device that someone buys but also
you have everyone who's building on top

5288
01:32:11,430 --> 01:32:11,440
you have everyone who's building on top
 

5289
01:32:11,440 --> 01:32:13,030
you have everyone who's building on top
of it you have this additional ecosystem

5290
01:32:13,030 --> 01:32:13,040
of it you have this additional ecosystem
 

5291
01:32:13,040 --> 01:32:14,229
of it you have this additional ecosystem
value and then you have

5292
01:32:14,229 --> 01:32:14,239
value and then you have
 

5293
01:32:14,239 --> 01:32:15,510
value and then you have
additional data streams that come in

5294
01:32:15,510 --> 01:32:15,520
additional data streams that come in
 

5295
01:32:15,520 --> 01:32:17,350
additional data streams that come in
which increase the value of the product

5296
01:32:17,350 --> 01:32:17,360
which increase the value of the product
 

5297
01:32:17,360 --> 01:32:19,750
which increase the value of the product
and so if you say if you look at the the

5298
01:32:19,750 --> 01:32:19,760
and so if you say if you look at the the
 

5299
01:32:19,760 --> 01:32:20,550
and so if you say if you look at the the
hardware

5300
01:32:20,550 --> 01:32:20,560
hardware
 

5301
01:32:20,560 --> 01:32:24,070
hardware
as the instigator of value creation

5302
01:32:24,070 --> 01:32:24,080
as the instigator of value creation
 

5303
01:32:24,080 --> 01:32:26,310
as the instigator of value creation
you know over time it what we've built

5304
01:32:26,310 --> 01:32:26,320
you know over time it what we've built
 

5305
01:32:26,320 --> 01:32:28,149
you know over time it what we've built
may constitute five or ten percent of

5306
01:32:28,149 --> 01:32:28,159
may constitute five or ten percent of
 

5307
01:32:28,159 --> 01:32:29,750
may constitute five or ten percent of
the value of the overall ecosystem and

5308
01:32:29,750 --> 01:32:29,760
the value of the overall ecosystem and
 

5309
01:32:29,760 --> 01:32:30,310
the value of the overall ecosystem and
that's what we

5310
01:32:30,310 --> 01:32:30,320
that's what we
 

5311
01:32:30,320 --> 01:32:31,430
that's what we
really care about what we're trying to

5312
01:32:31,430 --> 01:32:31,440
really care about what we're trying to
 

5313
01:32:31,440 --> 01:32:35,830
really care about what we're trying to
do is kick-start the mainstream adoption

5314
01:32:35,830 --> 01:32:35,840
do is kick-start the mainstream adoption
 

5315
01:32:35,840 --> 01:32:38,950
do is kick-start the mainstream adoption
of quantifying the brain and the

5316
01:32:38,950 --> 01:32:38,960
of quantifying the brain and the
 

5317
01:32:38,960 --> 01:32:39,590
of quantifying the brain and the
hardware

5318
01:32:39,590 --> 01:32:39,600
hardware
 

5319
01:32:39,600 --> 01:32:42,390
hardware
just opens the door to say what kind of

5320
01:32:42,390 --> 01:32:42,400
just opens the door to say what kind of
 

5321
01:32:42,400 --> 01:32:44,870
just opens the door to say what kind of
ecosystem could exist

5322
01:32:44,870 --> 01:32:44,880
ecosystem could exist
 

5323
01:32:44,880 --> 01:32:47,110
ecosystem could exist
and that's why we the examples are so

5324
01:32:47,110 --> 01:32:47,120
and that's why we the examples are so
 

5325
01:32:47,120 --> 01:32:48,550
and that's why we the examples are so
relevant of the things you've outlined

walk whatever their pattern recognition
is

5542
01:36:16,310 --> 01:36:16,320

5552
01:36:24,149 --> 01:36:24,159
and so you have to overcome the initial
 

5553
01:36:24,159 --> 01:36:25,109
and so you have to overcome the initial
get out

5554
01:36:25,109 --> 01:36:25,119
get out
 

5555
01:36:25,119 --> 01:36:27,510
get out
and then once you engage when you say

5556
01:36:27,510 --> 01:36:27,520
and then once you engage when you say
 

5557
01:36:27,520 --> 01:36:29,669
and then once you engage when you say
the word credit card processing

5558
01:36:29,669 --> 01:36:29,679
the word credit card processing
 

5559
01:36:29,679 --> 01:36:31,109
the word credit card processing
the person's like i already hate you

5560
01:36:31,109 --> 01:36:31,119
the person's like i already hate you
 

5561
01:36:31,119 --> 01:36:33,270
the person's like i already hate you
because i have been taken advantage of

5562
01:36:33,270 --> 01:36:33,280
because i have been taken advantage of
 

5563
01:36:33,280 --> 01:36:36,310
because i have been taken advantage of
dozens of times because you all are

5564
01:36:36,310 --> 01:36:36,320
dozens of times because you all are
 

5565
01:36:36,320 --> 01:36:38,629
dozens of times because you all are
yeah weasels and so i had to figure out

5566
01:36:38,629 --> 01:36:38,639
yeah weasels and so i had to figure out
 

5567
01:36:38,639 --> 01:36:40,310
yeah weasels and so i had to figure out
an algorithm to get past all those

5568
01:36:40,310 --> 01:36:40,320
an algorithm to get past all those
 

5569
01:36:40,320 --> 01:36:41,270
an algorithm to get past all those
different conditions because i was still

5570
01:36:41,270 --> 01:36:41,280
different conditions because i was still
 

5571
01:36:41,280 --> 01:36:43,510
different conditions because i was still
working on my other startup uh for

5572
01:36:43,510 --> 01:36:43,520
working on my other startup uh for
 

5573
01:36:43,520 --> 01:36:44,629
working on my other startup uh for
the majority of my times i was doing

5574
01:36:44,629 --> 01:36:44,639
the majority of my times i was doing
 

5575
01:36:44,639 --> 01:36:47,350
the majority of my times i was doing
this part time and so i figured out that

5576
01:36:47,350 --> 01:36:47,360
this part time and so i figured out that
 

5577
01:36:47,360 --> 01:36:52,390
this part time and so i figured out that
the industry really was built on

5578
01:36:52,390 --> 01:36:52,400
the industry really was built on
 

5579
01:36:52,400 --> 01:36:55,990
the industry really was built on
people on deceit

5580
01:36:55,990 --> 01:36:56,000

basically people promising things that
that were not reality and so i'd walk

5584
01:36:58,709 --> 01:36:58,719
that were not reality and so i'd walk
 

5585
01:36:58,719 --> 01:37:00,629
that were not reality and so i'd walk
into a business and say look

01:38:24,480 --> 01:38:28,229
going to create a company and so then
i started braintree and the idea was the

5688
01:38:28,229 --> 01:38:28,239
i started braintree and the idea was the
 

5689
01:38:28,239 --> 01:38:30,629
i started braintree and the idea was the
online world was broken because

5690
01:38:30,629 --> 01:38:30,639
online world was broken because
 

5691
01:38:30,639 --> 01:38:34,149
online world was broken because
paypal had a uh had been acquired by

5692
01:38:34,149 --> 01:38:34,159
paypal had a uh had been acquired by
 

5693
01:38:34,159 --> 01:38:35,189
paypal had a uh had been acquired by
ebay

5694
01:38:35,189 --> 01:38:35,199
ebay
 

5695
01:38:35,199 --> 01:38:38,229
ebay
around i think 2000 1999 or 2000 and

5696
01:38:38,229 --> 01:38:38,239
around i think 2000 1999 or 2000 and
 

5697
01:38:38,239 --> 01:38:39,750
around i think 2000 1999 or 2000 and
ebay had not innovated much with paypal

5698
01:38:39,750 --> 01:38:39,760
ebay had not innovated much with paypal
 

5699
01:38:39,760 --> 01:38:40,070
ebay had not innovated much with paypal
so

5700
01:38:40,070 --> 01:38:40,080
so
 

5701
01:38:40,080 --> 01:38:42,790
so
it basically sat still for seven years

5702
01:38:42,790 --> 01:38:42,800
it basically sat still for seven years
 

5703
01:38:42,800 --> 01:38:43,189
it basically sat still for seven years
as

5704
01:38:43,189 --> 01:38:43,199
as
 

5705
01:38:43,199 --> 01:38:45,270
as
the software world moved along and then

5706
01:38:45,270 --> 01:38:45,280
the software world moved along and then
 

5707
01:38:45,280 --> 01:38:46,709
the software world moved along and then
authorized.net was also a company that

5708
01:38:46,709 --> 01:38:46,719
authorized.net was also a company that
 

5709
01:38:46,719 --> 01:38:48,070
authorized.net was also a company that
was relatively stagnant so you basically

5710
01:38:48,070 --> 01:38:48,080
was relatively stagnant so you basically
 

5711
01:38:48,080 --> 01:38:48,950
was relatively stagnant so you basically
had

5712
01:38:48,950 --> 01:38:48,960
had
 

5713
01:38:48,960 --> 01:38:50,870
had
software engineers who wanted modern

5714
01:38:50,870 --> 01:38:50,880
software engineers who wanted modern
 

5715
01:38:50,880 --> 01:38:52,550
software engineers who wanted modern
payment tools but there were none

5716
01:38:52,550 --> 01:38:52,560
payment tools but there were none
 

5717
01:38:52,560 --> 01:38:53,830
payment tools but there were none
available for them and so they just

5718
01:38:53,830 --> 01:38:53,840
available for them and so they just
 

5719
01:38:53,840 --> 01:38:55,109
available for them and so they just
dealt with software they didn't like and

5720
01:38:55,109 --> 01:38:55,119
dealt with software they didn't like and
 

5721
01:38:55,119 --> 01:38:57,109
dealt with software they didn't like and
so with braintree

5722
01:38:57,109 --> 01:38:57,119
so with braintree
 

5723
01:38:57,119 --> 01:38:58,390
so with braintree
i thought the entry point is to build

5724
01:38:58,390 --> 01:38:58,400
i thought the entry point is to build
 

5725
01:38:58,400 --> 01:39:00,229
i thought the entry point is to build
software that engineers will love

5726
01:39:00,229 --> 01:39:00,239
software that engineers will love
 

5727
01:39:00,239 --> 01:39:01,669
software that engineers will love
and if we can find the entry point via

5728
01:39:01,669 --> 01:39:01,679
and if we can find the entry point via
 

5729
01:39:01,679 --> 01:39:03,990
and if we can find the entry point via
software make it easy and beautiful and

5730
01:39:03,990 --> 01:39:04,000
software make it easy and beautiful and
 

5731
01:39:04,000 --> 01:39:05,430
software make it easy and beautiful and
just a magical experience and then

5732
01:39:05,430 --> 01:39:05,440
just a magical experience and then
 

5733
01:39:05,440 --> 01:39:06,790
just a magical experience and then
provide customer service on top of that

5734
01:39:06,790 --> 01:39:06,800
provide customer service on top of that
 

5735
01:39:06,800 --> 01:39:08,550
provide customer service on top of that
it was easy that would be great

5736
01:39:08,550 --> 01:39:08,560
it was easy that would be great
 

5737
01:39:08,560 --> 01:39:09,910
it was easy that would be great
what i was really going after for though

5738
01:39:09,910 --> 01:39:09,920
what i was really going after for though
 

5739
01:39:09,920 --> 01:39:12,149
what i was really going after for though
was it was paypal they were the only

5740
01:39:12,149 --> 01:39:12,159
was it was paypal they were the only
 

5741
01:39:12,159 --> 01:39:14,870
was it was paypal they were the only
company in payments making money

5742
01:39:14,870 --> 01:39:14,880
company in payments making money
 

5743
01:39:14,880 --> 01:39:17,430
company in payments making money
because they because they had the

5744
01:39:17,430 --> 01:39:17,440
because they because they had the
 

5745
01:39:17,440 --> 01:39:19,750
because they because they had the
relationship with ebay early on

5746
01:39:19,750 --> 01:39:19,760
relationship with ebay early on
 

5747
01:39:19,760 --> 01:39:22,390
relationship with ebay early on
people created a paypal account they'd

5748
01:39:22,390 --> 01:39:22,400
people created a paypal account they'd
 

5749
01:39:22,400 --> 01:39:23,590
people created a paypal account they'd
fund their account with their checking

5750
01:39:23,590 --> 01:39:23,600
fund their account with their checking
 

5751
01:39:23,600 --> 01:39:25,270
fund their account with their checking
account versus their credit cards

5752
01:39:25,270 --> 01:39:25,280
account versus their credit cards
 

5753
01:39:25,280 --> 01:39:26,950
account versus their credit cards
and then when they'd use paypal to pay a

5754
01:39:26,950 --> 01:39:26,960
and then when they'd use paypal to pay a
 

5755
01:39:26,960 --> 01:39:29,830
and then when they'd use paypal to pay a
merchant paypal had a cost of payment of

5756
01:39:29,830 --> 01:39:29,840
merchant paypal had a cost of payment of
 

5757
01:39:29,840 --> 01:39:30,950
merchant paypal had a cost of payment of
zero

5758
01:39:30,950 --> 01:39:30,960
zero
 

5759
01:39:30,960 --> 01:39:33,109
zero
versus if you have coming from a credit

5760
01:39:33,109 --> 01:39:33,119
versus if you have coming from a credit
 

5761
01:39:33,119 --> 01:39:34,950
versus if you have coming from a credit
card you have to pay the bank the fees

5762
01:39:34,950 --> 01:39:34,960
card you have to pay the bank the fees
 

5763
01:39:34,960 --> 01:39:36,629
card you have to pay the bank the fees
so paypal's margins were

5764
01:39:36,629 --> 01:39:36,639
so paypal's margins were
 

5765
01:39:36,639 --> 01:39:39,830
so paypal's margins were
three percent on a transaction

5766
01:39:39,830 --> 01:39:39,840
three percent on a transaction
 

5767
01:39:39,840 --> 01:39:41,590
three percent on a transaction
versus a typical payments company which

5768
01:39:41,590 --> 01:39:41,600
versus a typical payments company which
 

5769
01:39:41,600 --> 01:39:43,350
versus a typical payments company which
may be a nickel or a penny or a dime or

5770
01:39:43,350 --> 01:39:43,360
may be a nickel or a penny or a dime or
 

5771
01:39:43,360 --> 01:39:44,709
may be a nickel or a penny or a dime or
something like that

5772
01:39:44,709 --> 01:39:44,719
something like that
 

5773
01:39:44,719 --> 01:39:46,950
something like that
and so i knew a new paypal really was

5774
01:39:46,950 --> 01:39:46,960
and so i knew a new paypal really was
 

5775
01:39:46,960 --> 01:39:48,470
and so i knew a new paypal really was
the model to replicate but

5776
01:39:48,470 --> 01:39:48,480
the model to replicate but
 

5777
01:39:48,480 --> 01:39:50,070
the model to replicate but
a bunch of companies had tried to do

5778
01:39:50,070 --> 01:39:50,080
a bunch of companies had tried to do
 

5779
01:39:50,080 --> 01:39:51,350
a bunch of companies had tried to do
that they tried to come in and build a

5780
01:39:51,350 --> 01:39:51,360
that they tried to come in and build a
 

5781
01:39:51,360 --> 01:39:52,470
that they tried to come in and build a
two-sided marketplace

5782
01:39:52,470 --> 01:39:52,480
two-sided marketplace
 

5783
01:39:52,480 --> 01:39:54,790
two-sided marketplace
so get consumers to fund the checking

5784
01:39:54,790 --> 01:39:54,800
so get consumers to fund the checking
 

5785
01:39:54,800 --> 01:39:56,470
so get consumers to fund the checking
account and merchants to accept it

5786
01:39:56,470 --> 01:39:56,480
account and merchants to accept it
 

5787
01:39:56,480 --> 01:39:58,149
account and merchants to accept it
but they'd all failed because building a

5788
01:39:58,149 --> 01:39:58,159
but they'd all failed because building a
 

5789
01:39:58,159 --> 01:40:00,470
but they'd all failed because building a
two-sided marketplace is very hard

5790
01:40:00,470 --> 01:40:00,480
two-sided marketplace is very hard
 

5791
01:40:00,480 --> 01:40:02,709
two-sided marketplace is very hard
at the same time so my plan was i'm

5792
01:40:02,709 --> 01:40:02,719
at the same time so my plan was i'm
 

5793
01:40:02,719 --> 01:40:04,550
at the same time so my plan was i'm
going to build a company

5794
01:40:04,550 --> 01:40:04,560
going to build a company
 

5795

uh when i was at the university of

01:40:27,189 --> 01:40:27,199
uh when i was at the university of

01:40:27,199 --> 01:40:30,310
uh when i was at the university of
chicago and

5820

chicago and
 

5821
01:40:30,320 --> 01:40:32,470
chicago and
weirdly it happened exactly like that so

5822
01:40:32,470 --> 01:40:32,480
weirdly it happened exactly like that so
 

5823
01:40:32,480 --> 01:40:34,149
weirdly it happened exactly like that so
for four years in

we met up with venmo and they had done a
 

5843

in building products then something very

5846
01:40:55,990 --> 01:40:56,000
in building products then something very
 

5847
01:40:56,000 --> 01:40:57,990
in building products then something very

something that should be hidden from
others and we acquired venmo

5856
01:41:06,229 --> 01:41:06,239
others and we acquired venmo
 

5857
01:41:06,239 --> 01:41:09,990
others and we acquired venmo
and at that point we now had we

5858
01:41:09,990 --> 01:41:10,000
and at that point we now had we
 

5859
01:41:10,000 --> 01:41:11,350
and at that point we now had we
replicated the model because now people

5860
01:41:11,350 --> 01:41:11,360
replicated the model because now people
 

5861
01:41:11,360 --> 01:41:12,470
replicated the model because now people
could fund their venmo account with

5862
01:41:12,470 --> 01:41:12,480
could fund their venmo account with
 

5863
01:41:12,480 --> 01:41:13,830
could fund their venmo account with
their checking account keep money in the

account
 

5867
01:41:14,880 --> 01:41:16,709
account
and then you could just plug them one as

5868
01:41:16,709 --> 01:41:16,719
and then you could just plug them one as
 

5869
01:41:16,719 --> 01:41:18,390
and then you could just plug them one as
a form of payment and so

5870
01:41:18,390 --> 01:41:18,400
a form of payment and so
 

5871
01:41:18,400 --> 01:41:20,950
a form of payment and so
i think paypal saw that that we were

5872
01:41:20,950 --> 01:41:20,960
i think paypal saw that that we were

we had people using venmo they were both

5876
01:41:26,070 --> 01:41:26,080
we had people using venmo they were both
 

5877

time who had so much influence online
and so they came in and offered us uh an

5882
01:41:33,030 --> 01:41:33,040
and so they came in and offered us uh an
 

5883
01:41:33,040 --> 01:41:34,790
and so they came in and offered us uh an
attractive number

5884

attractive number
 

5885
01:41:34,800 --> 01:41:38,550
attractive number
and my my goal was not to

5886
01:41:38,550 --> 01:41:38,560
and my my goal was not to
 

5887
01:41:38,560 --> 01:41:40,390

to try to climb the forbes billionaire
 

5893
01:41:43,679 --> 01:41:44,870
to try to climb the forbes billionaire
list it was

5894
01:41:44,870 --> 01:41:44,880
list it was
 

5895
01:41:44,880 --> 01:41:47,270
list it was
the objective was i want to earn enough

5896
01:41:47,270 --> 01:41:47,280
the objective was i want to earn enough
 

5897
01:41:47,280 --> 01:41:48,790
the objective was i want to earn enough
money

5898
01:41:48,790 --> 01:41:48,800
money
 

5899
01:41:48,800 --> 01:41:51,990
money
so that i can basically dedicate my

5900
01:41:51,990 --> 01:41:52,000
so that i can basically dedicate my
 

5901
01:41:52,000 --> 01:41:53,910
so that i can basically dedicate my
attention to doing something that could

5902
01:41:53,910 --> 01:41:53,920
attention to doing something that could
 

5903
01:41:53,920 --> 01:41:56,149
attention to doing something that could
potentially be useful

5904
01:41:56,149 --> 01:41:56,159
potentially be useful
 

5905
01:41:56,159 --> 01:41:59,350
potentially be useful
on a society-wide skill and

5906
01:41:59,350 --> 01:41:59,360
on a society-wide skill and
 

5907
01:41:59,360 --> 01:42:01,270
on a society-wide skill and
uh more importantly that could be

5908
01:42:01,270 --> 01:42:01,280
uh more importantly that could be
 

5909
01:42:01,280 --> 01:42:03,270
uh more importantly that could be
considered to be valuable

5910
01:42:03,270 --> 01:42:03,280
considered to be valuable
 

5911
01:42:03,280 --> 01:42:06,390
considered to be valuable
from the vantage point of 2050

5912
01:42:06,390 --> 01:42:06,400
from the vantage point of 2050
 

5913
01:42:06,400 --> 01:42:09,510
from the vantage point of 2050
2100 and 2500 so

5914
01:42:09,510 --> 01:42:09,520
2100 and 2500 so
 

5915
01:42:09,520 --> 01:42:11,910
2100 and 2500 so
thinking about it on a a few hundred

5916
01:42:11,910 --> 01:42:11,920
thinking about it on a a few hundred
 

5917
01:42:11,920 --> 01:42:14,070
thinking about it on a a few hundred
year time scale

5918
01:42:14,070 --> 01:42:14,080
year time scale
 

5919
01:42:14,080 --> 01:42:15,669
year time scale
and there was a certain amount of money

5920
01:42:15,669 --> 01:42:15,679
and there was a certain amount of money
 

5921
01:42:15,679 --> 01:42:17,910
and there was a certain amount of money
i needed to do that so i didn't

5922
01:42:17,910 --> 01:42:17,920
i needed to do that so i didn't
 

5923
01:42:17,920 --> 01:42:20,070
i needed to do that so i didn't
require the permission of anybody to do

5924
01:42:20,070 --> 01:42:20,080
require the permission of anybody to do
 

5925
01:42:20,080 --> 01:42:21,590
require the permission of anybody to do
that and so that

5926
01:42:21,590 --> 01:42:21,600
that and so that
 

5927
01:42:21,600 --> 01:42:23,109
that and so that
what paypal offered was sufficient for

5928
01:42:23,109 --> 01:42:23,119
what paypal offered was sufficient for
 

5929
01:42:23,119 --> 01:42:24,629
what paypal offered was sufficient for
me to get that amount of money to

5930
01:42:24,629 --> 01:42:24,639
me to get that amount of money to
 

5931
01:42:24,639 --> 01:42:25,669
me to get that amount of money to
basically have a go

5932
01:42:25,669 --> 01:42:25,679
basically have a go
 

5933
01:42:25,679 --> 01:42:29,510
basically have a go
and that's when i set off to

5934
01:42:29,510 --> 01:42:29,520
and that's when i set off to
 

5935
01:42:29,520 --> 01:42:32,229
and that's when i set off to
survey everything i could identify in

5936
01:42:32,229 --> 01:42:32,239
survey everything i could identify in
 

5937
01:42:32,239 --> 01:42:33,270
survey everything i could identify in
existence to say

5938
01:42:33,270 --> 01:42:33,280
existence to say
 

5939
01:42:33,280 --> 01:42:34,950
existence to say
of anything in the entire world i could

5940
01:42:34,950 --> 01:42:34,960
of anything in the entire world i could
 

5941
01:42:34,960 --> 01:42:37,350
of anything in the entire world i could
do what one thing could i do

5942
01:42:37,350 --> 01:42:37,360
do what one thing could i do
 

5943
01:42:37,360 --> 01:42:39,270
do what one thing could i do
that would actually have the highest

5944
01:42:39,270 --> 01:42:39,280
that would actually have the highest
 

5945
01:42:39,280 --> 01:42:40,390
that would actually have the highest
value

5946
01:42:40,390 --> 01:42:40,400
value
 

5947
01:42:40,400 --> 01:42:43,109
value
potential for the species and so it took

5948
01:42:43,109 --> 01:42:43,119
potential for the species and so it took
 

5949
01:42:43,119 --> 01:42:44,709
potential for the species and so it took
me a little while to arrive at brain

5950
01:42:44,709 --> 01:42:44,719
me a little while to arrive at brain
 

5951
01:42:44,719 --> 01:42:46,629
me a little while to arrive at brain
interfaces but

5952
01:42:46,629 --> 01:42:46,639
interfaces but
 

5953
01:42:46,639 --> 01:42:49,830
interfaces but

it was a an attempted communication that

6044
01:44:27,350 --> 01:44:27,360
it was a an attempted communication that
 

6045
01:44:27,360 --> 01:44:30,629
it was a an attempted communication that
when i was surveying the world it was an

what could i individually yes do
 

6051
01:44:35,760 --> 01:44:38,229
what could i individually yes do
so there's there are things that exist

6052
01:44:38,229 --> 01:44:38,239
so there's there are things that exist
 

6053
01:44:38,239 --> 01:44:39,990
so there's there are things that exist
that have a lot of potential that can be

something done that otherwise couldn't
 

6079
01:44:59,119 --> 01:45:00,950
something done that otherwise couldn't
get done so there's

get done so there's
 

6081
01:45:00,960 --> 01:45:02,950

there's a process of assessing where can

there's a process of assessing where can
you add unique value in the world

6084
01:45:04,310 --> 01:45:04,320
you add unique value in the world
 

6085
01:45:04,320 --> 01:45:06,070
you add unique value in the world
and some of that has to do with you're

6086
01:45:06,070 --> 01:45:06,080
and some of that has to do with you're
 

6087
01:45:06,080 --> 01:45:07,590
and some of that has to do with you're
being very uh

6088
01:45:07,590 --> 01:45:07,600
being very uh
 

6089
01:45:07,600 --> 01:45:09,910
being very uh
very formal and calculative here but

6090
01:45:09,910 --> 01:45:09,920
very formal and calculative here but
 

6091
01:45:09,920 --> 01:45:11,189
very formal and calculative here but
some of that is just like

6092
01:45:11,189 --> 01:45:11,199
some of that is just like
 

6093
01:45:11,199 --> 01:45:14,229
some of that is just like
what do you sense like part of that

6094
01:45:14,229 --> 01:45:14,239
what do you sense like part of that
 

6095
01:45:14,239 --> 01:45:14,950
what do you sense like part of that
equation

6096
01:45:14,950 --> 01:45:14,960
equation
 

6097
01:45:14,960 --> 01:45:16,790
equation
is how much passion you sense within

6098
01:45:16,790 --> 01:45:16,800
is how much passion you sense within
 

6099
01:45:16,800 --> 01:45:18,229
is how much passion you sense within
yourself to be able to drive that

6100
01:45:18,229 --> 01:45:18,239
yourself to be able to drive that
 

6101
01:45:18,239 --> 01:45:18,950
yourself to be able to drive that
through

6102
01:45:18,950 --> 01:45:18,960
through
 

6103
01:45:18,960 --> 01:45:20,629
through
to discover the impossibilities and make

6104
01:45:20,629 --> 01:45:20,639
to discover the impossibilities and make
 

6105
01:45:20,639 --> 01:45:22,550
to discover the impossibilities and make
them possible that's right and so we

6106
01:45:22,550 --> 01:45:22,560
them possible that's right and so we
 

6107
01:45:22,560 --> 01:45:24,629
them possible that's right and so we
we were a braintree i think we were the

6108
01:45:24,629 --> 01:45:24,639
we were a braintree i think we were the
 

6109
01:45:24,639 --> 01:45:26,870
we were a braintree i think we were the
first company to integrate coinbase

6110
01:45:26,870 --> 01:45:26,880
first company to integrate coinbase
 

6111
01:45:26,880 --> 01:45:29,270
first company to integrate coinbase
into our i think we were the first

in doing that
 

6131
01:45:44,880 --> 01:45:49,030
in doing that
and of course this was in the year 2013.

alignment
 

6163
01:46:24,239 --> 01:46:26,790
alignment
with people so it's to me it's a

6164
01:46:26,790 --> 01:46:26,800
with people so it's to me it's a
 

6165
01:46:26,800 --> 01:46:28,149
with people so it's to me it's a
continuous spectrum

6166
01:46:28,149 --> 01:46:28,159
continuous spectrum
 

6167
01:46:28,159 --> 01:46:30,149
continuous spectrum
of possibility and we're talk your

6168
01:46:30,149 --> 01:46:30,159
of possibility and we're talk your
 

6169
01:46:30,159 --> 01:46:32,070
of possibility and we're talk your
question is isolated on the money

6170
01:46:32,070 --> 01:46:32,080
question is isolated on the money
 

6171
01:46:32,080 --> 01:46:34,149
question is isolated on the money
and i think it just is basically a

6172
01:46:34,149 --> 01:46:34,159
and i think it just is basically a
 

6173
01:46:34,159 --> 01:46:35,910
and i think it just is basically a

and so it introduces this scaffolding
 

6261
01:48:04,719 --> 01:48:06,070
and so it introduces this scaffolding
which i think again is the right

uh not not making good decisions for the

6338
01:49:29,910 --> 01:49:29,920
uh not not making good decisions for the
 

6339
01:49:29,920 --> 01:49:32,149
uh not not making good decisions for the
long-term well-being and happiness

6340
01:49:32,149 --> 01:49:32,159
long-term well-being and happiness
 

6341
01:49:32,159 --> 01:49:34,790
long-term well-being and happiness
of the entirety of the organism uh

6342
01:49:34,790 --> 01:49:34,800
of the entirety of the organism uh
 

6343
01:49:34,800 --> 01:49:36,149
of the entirety of the organism uh
basically you were like pigging out at

6344
01:49:36,149 --> 01:49:36,159
basically you were like pigging out at
 

6345
01:49:36,159 --> 01:49:37,030
basically you were like pigging out at
night and but it's

6346
01:49:37,030 --> 01:49:37,040
night and but it's
 

6347
01:49:37,040 --> 01:49:40,149
night and but it's
interesting because i do this i do the

6348
01:49:40,149 --> 01:49:40,159
interesting because i do this i do the
 

6349
01:49:40,159 --> 01:49:41,030
interesting because i do this i do the
same

6350
01:49:41,030 --> 01:49:41,040
same
 

6351
01:49:41,040 --> 01:49:45,430
same
in fact i often eat one meal a day

6352
01:49:45,430 --> 01:49:45,440

 

6353
01:49:45,440 --> 01:49:48,709

and uh like i have been this this week

6354
01:49:48,709 --> 01:49:48,719
and uh like i have been this this week
 

6355
01:49:48,719 --> 01:49:52,149
and uh like i have been this this week
actually especially when i travel

6356
01:49:52,149 --> 01:49:52,159
actually especially when i travel
 

6357
01:49:52,159 --> 01:49:55,589
actually especially when i travel
and it's it's funny that uh

6358
01:49:55,589 --> 01:49:55,599
and it's it's funny that uh
 

6359
01:49:55,599 --> 01:49:58,629
and it's it's funny that uh
it never occurred to me to just

6360
01:49:58,629 --> 01:49:58,639
it never occurred to me to just
 

6361
01:49:58,639 --> 01:50:01,189
it never occurred to me to just
basically look at the fact that i'm able

6362
01:50:01,189 --> 01:50:01,199
basically look at the fact that i'm able
 

6363
01:50:01,199 --> 01:50:02,950
basically look at the fact that i'm able
to be much smarter about my eating

6364
01:50:02,950 --> 01:50:02,960
to be much smarter about my eating
 

6365
01:50:02,960 --> 01:50:04,390
to be much smarter about my eating
decisions in the morning in the

6366
01:50:04,390 --> 01:50:04,400
decisions in the morning in the
 

6367
01:50:04,400 --> 01:50:06,550
decisions in the morning in the
afternoon than i am at night

6368
01:50:06,550 --> 01:50:06,560
afternoon than i am at night
 

6369
01:50:06,560 --> 01:50:08,950
afternoon than i am at night
so if i eat one meal a day why not eat

6370
01:50:08,950 --> 01:50:08,960
so if i eat one meal a day why not eat
 

6371
01:50:08,960 --> 01:50:10,470
so if i eat one meal a day why not eat
that one meal a day

6372
01:50:10,470 --> 01:50:10,480
that one meal a day
 

6373
01:50:10,480 --> 01:50:13,910
that one meal a day
in the morning like i'm not

6374
01:50:13,910 --> 01:50:13,920
in the morning like i'm not
 

6375
01:50:13,920 --> 01:50:16,149
in the morning like i'm not
it never occurred to me this

6376
01:50:16,149 --> 01:50:16,159
it never occurred to me this
 

6377
01:50:16,159 --> 01:50:18,070
it never occurred to me this
revolutionary yeah

6378
01:50:18,070 --> 01:50:18,080
revolutionary yeah
 

6379
01:50:18,080 --> 01:50:20,950
revolutionary yeah
until until you've uh you've outlined

6380
01:50:20,950 --> 01:50:20,960
until until you've uh you've outlined
 

6381
01:50:20,960 --> 01:50:21,910
until until you've uh you've outlined
that so maybe

6382
01:50:21,910 --> 01:50:21,920
that so maybe
 

6383
01:50:21,920 --> 01:50:24,550
that so maybe
can you give some details and what this

6384
01:50:24,550 --> 01:50:24,560
can you give some details and what this
 

6385
01:50:24,560 --> 01:50:27,350
can you give some details and what this
is just you this is one person brian

6386
01:50:27,350 --> 01:50:27,360
is just you this is one person brian
 

6387
01:50:27,360 --> 01:50:29,350
is just you this is one person brian
arrives at a particular thing that they

6388
01:50:29,350 --> 01:50:29,360
arrives at a particular thing that they
 

6389
01:50:29,360 --> 01:50:30,950
arrives at a particular thing that they
do but it's fascinating

6390
01:50:30,950 --> 01:50:30,960
do but it's fascinating
 

6391
01:50:30,960 --> 01:50:32,950
do but it's fascinating
uh to kind of look at this one

6392
01:50:32,950 --> 01:50:32,960
uh to kind of look at this one
 

6393
01:50:32,960 --> 01:50:34,310
uh to kind of look at this one
particular case study so

6394
01:50:34,310 --> 01:50:34,320
particular case study so
 

6395
01:50:34,320 --> 01:50:36,870
particular case study so
what works for you diet-wise what's your

6396
01:50:36,870 --> 01:50:36,880
what works for you diet-wise what's your
 

6397
01:50:36,880 --> 01:50:38,550
what works for you diet-wise what's your
actual diet what do you eat

6398
01:50:38,550 --> 01:50:38,560
actual diet what do you eat
 

6399
01:50:38,560 --> 01:50:41,109
actual diet what do you eat
how often do you eat my current protocol

6400
01:50:41,109 --> 01:50:41,119
how often do you eat my current protocol
 

6401
01:50:41,119 --> 01:50:42,390
how often do you eat my current protocol
is

6402
01:50:42,390 --> 01:50:42,400
is
 

6403
01:50:42,400 --> 01:50:45,430
is
basically the the result of thousands of

6404
01:50:45,430 --> 01:50:45,440
basically the the result of thousands of
 

6405
01:50:45,440 --> 01:50:46,790
basically the the result of thousands of
experiments

6406
01:50:46,790 --> 01:50:46,800
experiments
 

6407
01:50:46,800 --> 01:50:50,070
experiments
and decision making so i've i do this

6408
01:50:50,070 --> 01:50:50,080
and decision making so i've i do this
 

6409
01:50:50,080 --> 01:50:51,750
and decision making so i've i do this
every 90 days i do the tests

6410
01:50:51,750 --> 01:50:51,760
every 90 days i do the tests
 

6411
01:50:51,760 --> 01:50:53,990
every 90 days i do the tests
i do the cycle throughs then i measure

6412
01:50:53,990 --> 01:50:54,000
i do the cycle throughs then i measure
 

6413
01:50:54,000 --> 01:50:55,189
i do the cycle throughs then i measure
again and then

6414
01:50:55,189 --> 01:50:55,199
again and then
 

6415
01:50:55,199 --> 01:50:57,589
again and then
i'm measuring all the time and so what i

6416
01:50:57,589 --> 01:50:57,599
i'm measuring all the time and so what i
 

6417
01:50:57,599 --> 01:50:58,870
i'm measuring all the time and so what i
i of course i'm

6418
01:50:58,870 --> 01:50:58,880
i of course i'm
 

6419
01:50:58,880 --> 01:51:00,790
i of course i'm
optimizing for my biomarkers i want

6420
01:51:00,790 --> 01:51:00,800
optimizing for my biomarkers i want
 

6421
01:51:00,800 --> 01:51:02,149
optimizing for my biomarkers i want
perfect cholesterol and i brought

6422
01:51:02,149 --> 01:51:02,159
perfect cholesterol and i brought
 

6423
01:51:02,159 --> 01:51:02,709
perfect cholesterol and i brought
perfect

6424
01:51:02,709 --> 01:51:02,719
perfect
 

6425
01:51:02,719 --> 01:51:04,830
perfect
blood glucose levels and perfect dna

6426
01:51:04,830 --> 01:51:04,840
blood glucose levels and perfect dna
 

6427
01:51:04,840 --> 01:51:06,310
blood glucose levels and perfect dna
methylation

6428
01:51:06,310 --> 01:51:06,320
methylation
 

6429
01:51:06,320 --> 01:51:10,310
methylation
you know processes

6430
01:51:10,310 --> 01:51:10,320

 

6431
01:51:10,320 --> 01:51:12,790

i also want perfect sleep and so for

6432
01:51:12,790 --> 01:51:12,800
i also want perfect sleep and so for
 

6433
01:51:12,800 --> 01:51:13,350
i also want perfect sleep and so for
example

6434
01:51:13,350 --> 01:51:13,360
example
 

6435
01:51:13,360 --> 01:51:15,669
example
recently the past two weeks my resting

6436
01:51:15,669 --> 01:51:15,679
recently the past two weeks my resting
 

6437
01:51:15,679 --> 01:51:17,189
recently the past two weeks my resting
heart rate

6438
01:51:17,189 --> 01:51:17,199
heart rate
 

6439
01:51:17,199 --> 01:51:20,550
heart rate
has been a 42 when i sleep and when my

6440
01:51:20,550 --> 01:51:20,560
has been a 42 when i sleep and when my
 

6441
01:51:20,560 --> 01:51:22,070
has been a 42 when i sleep and when my
resting heart rate's at 42

6442
01:51:22,070 --> 01:51:22,080
resting heart rate's at 42
 

6443
01:51:22,080 --> 01:51:24,550
resting heart rate's at 42
my hrv is at its highest and i wake up

6444
01:51:24,550 --> 01:51:24,560
my hrv is at its highest and i wake up
 

6445
01:51:24,560 --> 01:51:25,910
my hrv is at its highest and i wake up
in the morning

6446
01:51:25,910 --> 01:51:25,920
in the morning
 

6447
01:51:25,920 --> 01:51:29,510
in the morning
feeling more energized than any other

6448
01:51:29,510 --> 01:51:29,520
feeling more energized than any other
 

6449
01:51:29,520 --> 01:51:30,310
feeling more energized than any other
configuration

6450
01:51:30,310 --> 01:51:30,320
configuration
 

6451
01:51:30,320 --> 01:51:32,229
configuration
and so i know from all these processes

6452
01:51:32,229 --> 01:51:32,239
and so i know from all these processes
 

6453
01:51:32,239 --> 01:51:33,910
and so i know from all these processes
that eating at roughly 8 30 in the

6454
01:51:33,910 --> 01:51:33,920
that eating at roughly 8 30 in the
 

6455
01:51:33,920 --> 01:51:34,550
that eating at roughly 8 30 in the
morning

6456
01:51:34,550 --> 01:51:34,560
morning
 

6457
01:51:34,560 --> 01:51:36,070
morning
right after i work out on an empty

6458
01:51:36,070 --> 01:51:36,080
right after i work out on an empty
 

6459
01:51:36,080 --> 01:51:39,030
right after i work out on an empty
stomach creates enough

6460
01:51:39,030 --> 01:51:39,040
stomach creates enough
 

6461
01:51:39,040 --> 01:51:41,430
stomach creates enough
distance between that completed eating

6462
01:51:41,430 --> 01:51:41,440
distance between that completed eating
 

6463
01:51:41,440 --> 01:51:43,189
distance between that completed eating
and bedtime where

6464
01:51:43,189 --> 01:51:43,199
and bedtime where
 

6465
01:51:43,199 --> 01:51:45,430
and bedtime where
i have no almost no digestion processes

6466
01:51:45,430 --> 01:51:45,440
i have no almost no digestion processes
 

6467
01:51:45,440 --> 01:51:46,550
i have no almost no digestion processes
going on

6468
01:51:46,550 --> 01:51:46,560
going on
 

6469
01:51:46,560 --> 01:51:48,149
going on
in my body therefore my resting heart

6470
01:51:48,149 --> 01:51:48,159
in my body therefore my resting heart
 

6471
01:51:48,159 --> 01:51:49,589
in my body therefore my resting heart
rate goes very low

6472
01:51:49,589 --> 01:51:49,599
rate goes very low
 

6473
01:51:49,599 --> 01:51:51,430
rate goes very low
and when my heart rate is very low i

6474
01:51:51,430 --> 01:51:51,440
and when my heart rate is very low i
 

6475
01:51:51,440 --> 01:51:52,870
and when my heart rate is very low i
sleep with high quality and so basically

6476
01:51:52,870 --> 01:51:52,880
sleep with high quality and so basically
 

6477
01:51:52,880 --> 01:51:54,229
sleep with high quality and so basically
i've been trying to optimize

6478
01:51:54,229 --> 01:51:54,239
i've been trying to optimize
 

6479
01:51:54,239 --> 01:51:57,430
i've been trying to optimize
the entirety of what i eat to my sleep

6480
01:51:57,430 --> 01:51:57,440
the entirety of what i eat to my sleep
 

6481
01:51:57,440 --> 01:51:58,070
the entirety of what i eat to my sleep
quality

6482
01:51:58,070 --> 01:51:58,080
quality
 

6483
01:51:58,080 --> 01:51:59,350
quality
and my sleep quality then of course

6484
01:51:59,350 --> 01:51:59,360
and my sleep quality then of course
 

6485
01:51:59,360 --> 01:52:00,790
and my sleep quality then of course
feeds into my willpower so it creates

6486
01:52:00,790 --> 01:52:00,800
feeds into my willpower so it creates
 

6487
01:52:00,800 --> 01:52:01,189
feeds into my willpower so it creates
this

6488
01:52:01,189 --> 01:52:01,199
this
 

6489
01:52:01,199 --> 01:52:03,510
this
virtuous cycle and so what i at 830 what

6490
01:52:03,510 --> 01:52:03,520
virtuous cycle and so what i at 830 what
 

6491
01:52:03,520 --> 01:52:05,109
virtuous cycle and so what i at 830 what
i do is i eat

6492
01:52:05,109 --> 01:52:05,119
i do is i eat
 

6493
01:52:05,119 --> 01:52:07,350
i do is i eat
what i call super veggie which is it's a

6494
01:52:07,350 --> 01:52:07,360
what i call super veggie which is it's a
 

6495
01:52:07,360 --> 01:52:08,149
what i call super veggie which is it's a
pudding

6496
01:52:08,149 --> 01:52:08,159
pudding
 

6497
01:52:08,159 --> 01:52:10,870
pudding
of 250 grams of broccoli 150 grams of

6498
01:52:10,870 --> 01:52:10,880
of 250 grams of broccoli 150 grams of

i have a third dish which is it changes
every day

6548
01:52:54,950 --> 01:52:54,960
every day
 

6549
01:52:54,960 --> 01:52:56,870

potato
 

6553
01:52:58,159 --> 01:53:03,030
potato
and then i take about 20 supplements

6554
01:53:03,030 --> 01:53:03,040
and then i take about 20 supplements
 

6555
01:53:03,040 --> 01:53:06,629
and then i take about 20 supplements
that hopefully make

6556
01:53:06,629 --> 01:53:06,639
that hopefully make
 

6557
01:53:06,639 --> 01:53:09,030
that hopefully make
constitute a perfect nutritional profile

6558
01:53:09,030 --> 01:53:09,040

can you well i have a million questions
 

6573
01:53:20,960 --> 01:53:23,270
can you well i have a million questions
but 20 supplements like what kind or

01:54:37,750 --> 01:54:37,760
much better if you're doing just that
 

6657
01:54:37,760 --> 01:54:39,350
much better if you're doing just that
if you just did the data collect or it

6658
01:54:39,350 --> 01:54:39,360
if you just did the data collect or it
 

6659
01:54:39,360 --> 01:54:40,870
if you just did the data collect or it
was being essentially done for you and

6660
01:54:40,870 --> 01:54:40,880
was being essentially done for you and
 

6661
01:54:40,880 --> 01:54:41,750
was being essentially done for you and
you can

6662
01:54:41,750 --> 01:54:41,760
you can
 

6663
01:54:41,760 --> 01:54:43,589
you can
outsource that to another scientist

6664
01:54:43,589 --> 01:54:43,599
outsource that to another scientist
 

6665
01:54:43,599 --> 01:54:45,910
outsource that to another scientist
that's doing the no one study of you

6666
01:54:45,910 --> 01:54:45,920
that's doing the no one study of you
 

6667
01:54:45,920 --> 01:54:47,750
that's doing the no one study of you
that's right because every time i spend

6668
01:54:47,750 --> 01:54:47,760
that's right because every time i spend
 

6669
01:54:47,760 --> 01:54:49,669
that's right because every time i spend
time thinking about this or executing

6670
01:54:49,669 --> 01:54:49,679
time thinking about this or executing
 

6671
01:54:49,679 --> 01:54:51,350
time thinking about this or executing
spending time on i'm spending less time

6672
01:54:51,350 --> 01:54:51,360
spending time on i'm spending less time
 

6673
01:54:51,360 --> 01:54:52,790
spending time on i'm spending less time
thinking about

6674
01:54:52,790 --> 01:54:52,800
thinking about
 

6675
01:54:52,800 --> 01:54:54,470
thinking about
building kernel or or the future of

6676
01:54:54,470 --> 01:54:54,480
building kernel or or the future of
 

6677
01:54:54,480 --> 01:54:55,910
building kernel or or the future of
being human and so it's

6678
01:54:55,910 --> 01:54:55,920
being human and so it's
 

6679
01:54:55,920 --> 01:54:59,030
being human and so it's
we just all have this the budget of

6680
01:54:59,030 --> 01:54:59,040
we just all have this the budget of
 

6681
01:54:59,040 --> 01:55:03,270
we just all have this the budget of
our capacity on everyday basis and

6682
01:55:03,270 --> 01:55:03,280
our capacity on everyday basis and
 

6683
01:55:03,280 --> 01:55:05,510
our capacity on everyday basis and
we will scaffold our way up out of this

6684
01:55:05,510 --> 01:55:05,520
we will scaffold our way up out of this
 

6685
01:55:05,520 --> 01:55:06,870
we will scaffold our way up out of this
and so yeah hopefully that what i'm

6686
01:55:06,870 --> 01:55:06,880
and so yeah hopefully that what i'm
 

6687
01:55:06,880 --> 01:55:07,270
and so yeah hopefully that what i'm
doing

6688
01:55:07,270 --> 01:55:07,280
doing
 

6689
01:55:07,280 --> 01:55:09,589
doing
is really it serves as a model uh that

6690
01:55:09,589 --> 01:55:09,599
is really it serves as a model uh that
 

6691
01:55:09,599 --> 01:55:10,790
is really it serves as a model uh that
others can also

6692
01:55:10,790 --> 01:55:10,800
others can also
 

6693
01:55:10,800 --> 01:55:12,149
others can also
you build that's why that's why i wrote

6694
01:55:12,149 --> 01:55:12,159
you build that's why that's why i wrote
 

6695
01:55:12,159 --> 01:55:13,510
you build that's why that's why i wrote
about it is hopefully people can take it

6696
01:55:13,510 --> 01:55:13,520
about it is hopefully people can take it
 

6697
01:55:13,520 --> 01:55:15,030
about it is hopefully people can take it
and improve upon it

6698
01:55:15,030 --> 01:55:15,040
and improve upon it
 

6699
01:55:15,040 --> 01:55:17,189
and improve upon it
uh i hold nothing sacred i change my

6700
01:55:17,189 --> 01:55:17,199
uh i hold nothing sacred i change my
 

6701
01:55:17,199 --> 01:55:18,310
uh i hold nothing sacred i change my
diet

6702
01:55:18,310 --> 01:55:18,320
diet
 

6703
01:55:18,320 --> 01:55:20,470
diet
almost every day based upon some new

6704
01:55:20,470 --> 01:55:20,480
almost every day based upon some new
 

6705
01:55:20,480 --> 01:55:21,910
almost every day based upon some new
test results or science or something

6706
01:55:21,910 --> 01:55:21,920
test results or science or something
 

6707
01:55:21,920 --> 01:55:22,870
test results or science or something
like that but

6708
01:55:22,870 --> 01:55:22,880
like that but
 

6709
01:55:22,880 --> 01:55:24,629
like that but
can you maybe elaborate on the sleep

6710
01:55:24,629 --> 01:55:24,639
can you maybe elaborate on the sleep
 

6711
01:55:24,639 --> 01:55:27,270
can you maybe elaborate on the sleep
thing why is sleep so important

6712
01:55:27,270 --> 01:55:27,280
thing why is sleep so important
 

6713
01:55:27,280 --> 01:55:31,030
thing why is sleep so important
and why presumably if like

6714
01:55:31,030 --> 01:55:31,040
and why presumably if like
 

6715
01:55:31,040 --> 01:55:34,709
and why presumably if like
what does good sleep mean to you

6716
01:55:34,709 --> 01:55:34,719
what does good sleep mean to you
 

6717

01:55:38,790 --> 01:55:38,800
i think sleep is a contender for
 

6719
01:55:38,800 --> 01:55:43,830
i think sleep is a contender for
being the most powerful

6720
01:55:43,830 --> 01:55:43,840

 

6721
01:55:43,840 --> 01:55:48,310

health intervention in existence

6722
01:55:48,310 --> 01:55:48,320

 

6723
01:55:48,320 --> 01:55:51,189

it's a contender i mean it's uh it's

6724
01:55:51,189 --> 01:55:51,199
it's a contender i mean it's uh it's
 

6725
01:55:51,199 --> 01:55:52,950
it's a contender i mean it's uh it's
magical what it does if you're well

6726
01:55:52,950 --> 01:55:52,960
magical what it does if you're well

i eat
close to my bedtime and i've done a

6736

close to my bedtime and i've done a
 

6737
01:56:02,159 --> 01:56:04,229
close to my bedtime and i've done a
systematic study

6738
01:56:04,229 --> 01:56:04,239
systematic study
 

6739
01:56:04,239 --> 01:56:06,629
systematic study
for years looking at like 15 minute

6740
01:56:06,629 --> 01:56:06,639
for years looking at like 15 minute
 

6741
01:56:06,639 --> 01:56:08,310
for years looking at like 15 minute
increments on time of day on where i eat

6742
01:56:08,310 --> 01:56:08,320
increments on time of day on where i eat
 

6743
01:56:08,320 --> 01:56:09,750
increments on time of day on where i eat
my last meal

6744
01:56:09,750 --> 01:56:09,760
my last meal
 

6745
01:56:09,760 --> 01:56:12,629
my last meal
my willpower is directly correlated to

6746
01:56:12,629 --> 01:56:12,639
my willpower is directly correlated to
 

6747
01:56:12,639 --> 01:56:15,270
my willpower is directly correlated to
my to the amount of deep sleep i get

6748
01:56:15,270 --> 01:56:15,280
my to the amount of deep sleep i get
 

6749
01:56:15,280 --> 01:56:18,629
my to the amount of deep sleep i get
so my ability to not binge eat at night

6750
01:56:18,629 --> 01:56:18,639
so my ability to not binge eat at night
 

6751
01:56:18,639 --> 01:56:22,149
so my ability to not binge eat at night
when rascal brian's out and about

6752
01:56:22,149 --> 01:56:22,159
when rascal brian's out and about
 

6753
01:56:22,159 --> 01:56:23,669
when rascal brian's out and about
is based upon how much deep sleep i got

6754
01:56:23,669 --> 01:56:23,679
is based upon how much deep sleep i got
 

6755
01:56:23,679 --> 01:56:25,430
is based upon how much deep sleep i got
the night before yeah and so

6756
01:56:25,430 --> 01:56:25,440
the night before yeah and so
 

6757
01:56:25,440 --> 01:56:27,189
the night before yeah and so
there's some there's a lot to that yeah

6758
01:56:27,189 --> 01:56:27,199
there's some there's a lot to that yeah
 

6759
01:56:27,199 --> 01:56:28,709
there's some there's a lot to that yeah
and so i just i've seen it

6760
01:56:28,709 --> 01:56:28,719
and so i just i've seen it
 

6761
01:56:28,719 --> 01:56:32,629
and so i just i've seen it
manifest itself and so the i think

6762
01:56:32,629 --> 01:56:32,639
manifest itself and so the i think
 

6763
01:56:32,639 --> 01:56:34,709
manifest itself and so the i think
the way i summarize this is in society

6764
01:56:34,709 --> 01:56:34,719
the way i summarize this is in society
 

6765
01:56:34,719 --> 01:56:35,910
the way i summarize this is in society
we've had this myth

6766
01:56:35,910 --> 01:56:35,920
we've had this myth
 

6767
01:56:35,920 --> 01:56:37,669
we've had this myth
of we tell stories for example of

6768
01:56:37,669 --> 01:56:37,679
of we tell stories for example of
 

6769
01:56:37,679 --> 01:56:39,030
of we tell stories for example of
entrepreneurship

6770
01:56:39,030 --> 01:56:39,040
entrepreneurship
 

6771
01:56:39,040 --> 01:56:41,669
entrepreneurship
where this person was so amazing they

6772
01:56:41,669 --> 01:56:41,679
where this person was so amazing they
 

6773
01:56:41,679 --> 01:56:43,109
where this person was so amazing they
stayed at the office for three days and

6774
01:56:43,109 --> 01:56:43,119
stayed at the office for three days and
 

6775
01:56:43,119 --> 01:56:44,790
stayed at the office for three days and
slept under their desk

6776
01:56:44,790 --> 01:56:44,800
slept under their desk
 

6777
01:56:44,800 --> 01:56:47,669
slept under their desk
and we say wow that's amazing there's

6778
01:56:47,669 --> 01:56:47,679
and we say wow that's amazing there's
 

6779
01:56:47,679 --> 01:56:49,669
and we say wow that's amazing there's
that's amazing

6780
01:56:49,669 --> 01:56:49,679
that's amazing
 

6781
01:56:49,679 --> 01:56:52,310
that's amazing
and now i think we're headed towards a

6782
01:56:52,310 --> 01:56:52,320
and now i think we're headed towards a
 

6783
01:56:52,320 --> 01:56:53,189
and now i think we're headed towards a
state where we'd say

6784
01:56:53,189 --> 01:56:53,199
state where we'd say
 

6785
01:56:53,199 --> 01:56:56,070
state where we'd say
that's primitive and really not a good

6786
01:56:56,070 --> 01:56:56,080
that's primitive and really not a good
 

6787
01:56:56,080 --> 01:56:56,790
that's primitive and really not a good
idea

6788
01:56:56,790 --> 01:56:56,800
idea
 

6789
01:56:56,800 --> 01:56:59,910
idea
on every level and so

6790
01:56:59,910 --> 01:56:59,920
on every level and so
 

6791
01:56:59,920 --> 01:57:02,390
on every level and so
the new mythology is going to be the

6792
01:57:02,390 --> 01:57:02,400
the new mythology is going to be the
 

6793
01:57:02,400 --> 01:57:04,950
the new mythology is going to be the
exact opposite

6794
01:57:04,950 --> 01:57:04,960
exact opposite
 

6795
01:57:04,960 --> 01:57:07,910
exact opposite
yeah by the way just to sort of maybe

6796
01:57:07,910 --> 01:57:07,920
yeah by the way just to sort of maybe
 

6797
01:57:07,920 --> 01:57:10,229
yeah by the way just to sort of maybe
push back a little bit on that idea

6798
01:57:10,229 --> 01:57:10,239
push back a little bit on that idea
 

6799
01:57:10,239 --> 01:57:13,109
push back a little bit on that idea

6820
01:57:35,669 --> 01:57:35,679
in uh in lieu of your passions
 

6821
01:57:35,679 --> 01:57:38,390
in uh in lieu of your passions
is a signal to yourself that you're

6822
01:57:38,390 --> 01:57:38,400
is a signal to yourself that you're
 

6823
01:57:38,400 --> 01:57:40,390
is a signal to yourself that you're
throwing everything away so

6824
01:57:40,390 --> 01:57:40,400
throwing everything away so
 

6825
01:57:40,400 --> 01:57:43,510
throwing everything away so
i think what you're referring to is

6826
01:57:43,510 --> 01:57:43,520
i think what you're referring to is
 

6827
01:57:43,520 --> 01:57:45,350
i think what you're referring to is
how to have good performance for

6828
01:57:45,350 --> 01:57:45,360
how to have good performance for
 

6829
01:57:45,360 --> 01:57:47,669
how to have good performance for
prolonged periods of time

6830
01:57:47,669 --> 01:57:47,679
prolonged periods of time
 

6831
01:57:47,679 --> 01:57:50,470
prolonged periods of time
i think there's there's moments in life

6832
01:57:50,470 --> 01:57:50,480
i think there's there's moments in life
 

6833
01:57:50,480 --> 01:57:52,550
i think there's there's moments in life
when you need to throw all that away

6834
01:57:52,550 --> 01:57:52,560
when you need to throw all that away
 

6835
01:57:52,560 --> 01:57:54,870
when you need to throw all that away
all the plans away all the structure way

6836
01:57:54,870 --> 01:57:54,880
all the plans away all the structure way
 

6837
01:57:54,880 --> 01:57:55,990
all the plans away all the structure way
so the

6838
01:57:55,990 --> 01:57:56,000
so the
 

6839
01:57:56,000 --> 01:57:59,350
so the
i i don't this i'm not sure

6840
01:57:59,350 --> 01:57:59,360
i i don't this i'm not sure
 

6841
01:57:59,360 --> 01:58:01,030
i i don't this i'm not sure
i have an eloquent way of describing

6842
01:58:01,030 --> 01:58:01,040
i have an eloquent way of describing
 

6843
01:58:01,040 --> 01:58:03,270
i have an eloquent way of describing
exactly what i'm talking about but

6844
01:58:03,270 --> 01:58:03,280
exactly what i'm talking about but
 

6845
01:58:03,280 --> 01:58:05,990
exactly what i'm talking about but
it all depends on different on people

6846
01:58:05,990 --> 01:58:06,000
it all depends on different on people
 

6847
01:58:06,000 --> 01:58:07,669
it all depends on different on people
people are different

6848
01:58:07,669 --> 01:58:07,679
people are different
 

6849
01:58:07,679 --> 01:58:09,189
people are different
but there's a danger of over

6850
01:58:09,189 --> 01:58:09,199
but there's a danger of over
 

6851
01:58:09,199 --> 01:58:11,270
but there's a danger of over
optimization

6852
01:58:11,270 --> 01:58:11,280
optimization
 

6853
01:58:11,280 --> 01:58:13,589
optimization
to where you don't just give in to the

6854
01:58:13,589 --> 01:58:13,599
to where you don't just give in to the
 

6855
01:58:13,599 --> 01:58:14,390
to where you don't just give in to the
madness

6856
01:58:14,390 --> 01:58:14,400
madness
 

6857
01:58:14,400 --> 01:58:17,830
madness
of the way your brain flows

6858
01:58:17,830 --> 01:58:17,840
of the way your brain flows
 

6859
01:58:17,840 --> 01:58:21,430
of the way your brain flows
i mean to push back on my pushback is

6860
01:58:21,430 --> 01:58:21,440
i mean to push back on my pushback is
 

6861
01:58:21,440 --> 01:58:21,830
i mean to push back on my pushback is
like

6862
01:58:21,830 --> 01:58:21,840
like
 

6863
01:58:21,840 --> 01:58:25,350
like
it's nice to have like where the k

6864
01:58:25,350 --> 01:58:25,360
it's nice to have like where the k
 

6865
01:58:25,360 --> 01:58:28,950
it's nice to have like where the k
where the foundations

6866
01:58:28,950 --> 01:58:28,960
where the foundations
 

6867
01:58:28,960 --> 01:58:31,830
where the foundations
of your brain are not messed with so you

6868
01:58:31,830 --> 01:58:31,840
of your brain are not messed with so you
 

6869
01:58:31,840 --> 01:58:34,229
of your brain are not messed with so you
have a fixed foundation where the diet

6870
01:58:34,229 --> 01:58:34,239
have a fixed foundation where the diet
 

6871
01:58:34,239 --> 01:58:35,189
have a fixed foundation where the diet
is fixed

6872
01:58:35,189 --> 01:58:35,199
is fixed
 

6873
01:58:35,199 --> 01:58:36,870
is fixed
where the sleep is fixed and that all

6874
01:58:36,870 --> 01:58:36,880
where the sleep is fixed and that all
 

6875
01:58:36,880 --> 01:58:38,870
where the sleep is fixed and that all
that is optimal and the chaos happens in

6876
01:58:38,870 --> 01:58:38,880
that is optimal and the chaos happens in
 

6877
01:58:38,880 --> 01:58:40,390
that is optimal and the chaos happens in
the space of ideas as opposed to the

6878
01:58:40,390 --> 01:58:40,400
the space of ideas as opposed to the
 

6879
01:58:40,400 --> 01:58:43,030
the space of ideas as opposed to the
space of biology

6880
01:58:43,030 --> 01:58:43,040
space of biology
 

6881
01:58:43,040 --> 01:58:46,830
space of biology
but you know i i'm not sure if there's a

6882
01:58:46,830 --> 01:58:46,840
but you know i i'm not sure if there's a
 

6883
01:58:46,840 --> 01:58:49,589
but you know i i'm not sure if there's a
uh that requires real discipline and

6884
01:58:49,589 --> 01:58:49,599
uh that requires real discipline and
 

6885
01:58:49,599 --> 01:58:50,790
uh that requires real discipline and
forming habits

6886
01:58:50,790 --> 01:58:50,800
forming habits
 

6887
01:58:50,800 --> 01:58:53,109
forming habits
there's some aspect to which some of the

6888
01:58:53,109 --> 01:58:53,119
there's some aspect to which some of the
 

6889
01:58:53,119 --> 01:58:53,990
there's some aspect to which some of the
the best

6890
01:58:53,990 --> 01:58:54,000
the best
 

6891
01:58:54,000 --> 01:58:56,149
the best
uh days and weeks of my life have been

6892
01:58:56,149 --> 01:58:56,159
uh days and weeks of my life have been
 

6893
01:58:56,159 --> 01:58:58,470
uh days and weeks of my life have been
yeah sleeping under a desk kind of thing

6894
01:58:58,470 --> 01:58:58,480
yeah sleeping under a desk kind of thing
 

6895
01:58:58,480 --> 01:59:03,189
yeah sleeping under a desk kind of thing
and i don't i'm not too willing to

6896
01:59:03,189 --> 01:59:03,199
and i don't i'm not too willing to
 

6897
01:59:03,199 --> 01:59:07,990
and i don't i'm not too willing to
let go of things that empirically worked

6898
01:59:07,990 --> 01:59:08,000
let go of things that empirically worked
 

6899
01:59:08,000 --> 01:59:11,350
let go of things that empirically worked
for things that uh work in theory

6900
01:59:11,350 --> 01:59:11,360
for things that uh work in theory
 

6901
01:59:11,360 --> 01:59:14,310
for things that uh work in theory
and so i'm i'm again i'm absolutely with

6902
01:59:14,310 --> 01:59:14,320
and so i'm i'm again i'm absolutely with
 

6903
01:59:14,320 --> 01:59:16,070
and so i'm i'm again i'm absolutely with
you on sleep

6904
01:59:16,070 --> 01:59:16,080
you on sleep
 

6905
01:59:16,080 --> 01:59:19,510
you on sleep
also i'm with you on sleep conceptually

6906
01:59:19,510 --> 01:59:19,520
also i'm with you on sleep conceptually
 

6907
01:59:19,520 --> 01:59:20,070
also i'm with you on sleep conceptually
but

6908
01:59:20,070 --> 01:59:20,080
but
 

6909
01:59:20,080 --> 01:59:23,990
but
i'm also very humbled to understand that

6910
01:59:23,990 --> 01:59:24,000
i'm also very humbled to understand that
 

6911
01:59:24,000 --> 01:59:25,510
i'm also very humbled to understand that
for

6912
01:59:25,510 --> 01:59:25,520
for
 

6913
01:59:25,520 --> 01:59:27,589
for
different people good sleep means

6914
01:59:27,589 --> 01:59:27,599
different people good sleep means
 

6915
01:59:27,599 --> 01:59:28,629
different people good sleep means
different things

6916
01:59:28,629 --> 01:59:28,639
different things
 

6917
01:59:28,639 --> 01:59:31,990
different things
i'm very hesitant to trust science on

6918
01:59:31,990 --> 01:59:32,000
i'm very hesitant to trust science on
 

6919
01:59:32,000 --> 01:59:32,870
i'm very hesitant to trust science on
sleep

6920
01:59:32,870 --> 01:59:32,880
sleep
 

6921
01:59:32,880 --> 01:59:34,709
sleep
i think you should also be a scholar of

6922
01:59:34,709 --> 01:59:34,719
i think you should also be a scholar of
 

6923
01:59:34,719 --> 01:59:36,149
i think you should also be a scholar of
your own body again

6924
01:59:36,149 --> 01:59:36,159
your own body again
 

6925
01:59:36,159 --> 01:59:39,430
your own body again
experiment of n of one i'm not so

6926
01:59:39,430 --> 01:59:39,440
experiment of n of one i'm not so
 

6927
01:59:39,440 --> 01:59:42,629
experiment of n of one i'm not so
sure that a full night's sleep is great

6928
01:59:42,629 --> 01:59:42,639
sure that a full night's sleep is great
 

6929
01:59:42,639 --> 01:59:43,990
sure that a full night's sleep is great
for me

6930
01:59:43,990 --> 01:59:44,000
for me
 

6931
01:59:44,000 --> 01:59:47,750
for me
there is something about that power nap

6932
01:59:47,750 --> 01:59:47,760
there is something about that power nap
 

6933
01:59:47,760 --> 01:59:49,990
there is something about that power nap
that i just have not fully studied yet

6934
01:59:49,990 --> 01:59:50,000
that i just have not fully studied yet
 

6935
01:59:50,000 --> 01:59:52,629
that i just have not fully studied yet
but that nap is something special

6936
01:59:52,629 --> 01:59:52,639
but that nap is something special
 

6937
01:59:52,639 --> 01:59:55,189
but that nap is something special
i'm not sure i found the optimal thing

6938
01:59:55,189 --> 01:59:55,199
i'm not sure i found the optimal thing
 

6939
01:59:55,199 --> 01:59:55,830
i'm not sure i found the optimal thing
yeah

6940
01:59:55,830 --> 01:59:55,840
yeah
 

6941
01:59:55,840 --> 01:59:57,589
yeah
so like there's a lot to be explored to

6942
01:59:57,589 --> 01:59:57,599
so like there's a lot to be explored to
 

6943
01:59:57,599 --> 01:59:59,270
so like there's a lot to be explored to
what is exactly optimal

6944
01:59:59,270 --> 01:59:59,280
what is exactly optimal
 

6945
01:59:59,280 --> 02:00:01,430
what is exactly optimal
amount of sleep optimal kind of sleep

6946
02:00:01,430 --> 02:00:01,440
amount of sleep optimal kind of sleep
 

6947
02:00:01,440 --> 02:00:03,030
amount of sleep optimal kind of sleep
combined with diet and all those cousins

6948
02:00:03,030 --> 02:00:03,040
combined with diet and all those cousins
 

6949
02:00:03,040 --> 02:00:05,510
combined with diet and all those cousins
i mean that all maps the sort of data at

6950
02:00:05,510 --> 02:00:05,520
i mean that all maps the sort of data at
 

6951
02:00:05,520 --> 02:00:06,390
i mean that all maps the sort of data at
least the truth

6952
02:00:06,390 --> 02:00:06,400
least the truth
 

6953
02:00:06,400 --> 02:00:07,669
least the truth
exactly what all everything you're

6954
02:00:07,669 --> 02:00:07,679
exactly what all everything you're
 

6955
02:00:07,679 --> 02:00:09,589
exactly what all everything you're
referring to here's a data point for

6956
02:00:09,589 --> 02:00:09,599
referring to here's a data point for
 

6957
02:00:09,599 --> 02:00:10,830
referring to here's a data point for
your consideration

6958
02:00:10,830 --> 02:00:10,840
your consideration
 

6959
02:00:10,840 --> 02:00:14,870
your consideration
yes the progress in biology

6960
02:00:14,870 --> 02:00:14,880
yes the progress in biology
 

6961
02:00:14,880 --> 02:00:17,750
yes the progress in biology
over the past say decade has been

6962
02:00:17,750 --> 02:00:17,760
over the past say decade has been
 

6963
02:00:17,760 --> 02:00:18,709
over the past say decade has been
stunning

6964
02:00:18,709 --> 02:00:18,719
stunning
 

6965
02:00:18,719 --> 02:00:21,910
stunning
yes and it now appears as if

6966
02:00:21,910 --> 02:00:21,920
yes and it now appears as if
 

6967
02:00:21,920 --> 02:00:25,189
yes and it now appears as if
we will be able to replace

6968
02:00:25,189 --> 02:00:25,199
we will be able to replace
 

6969
02:00:25,199 --> 02:00:28,229
we will be able to replace
are organs xenox transplantation

6970
02:00:28,229 --> 02:00:28,239
are organs xenox transplantation
 

6971
02:00:28,239 --> 02:00:33,030
are organs xenox transplantation
and so we probably have a path

6972
02:00:33,030 --> 02:00:33,040
and so we probably have a path
 

6973
02:00:33,040 --> 02:00:36,390
and so we probably have a path
to replace and regenerate every organ of

6974
02:00:36,390 --> 02:00:36,400
to replace and regenerate every organ of
 

6975
02:00:36,400 --> 02:00:37,750
to replace and regenerate every organ of
your body

6976
02:00:37,750 --> 02:00:37,760
your body
 

6977
02:00:37,760 --> 02:00:42,390
your body
except for your brain

6978
02:00:42,390 --> 02:00:42,400

 

6979
02:00:42,400 --> 02:00:44,229

you can you can lose your hand and your

6980
02:00:44,229 --> 02:00:44,239
you can you can lose your hand and your
 

6981
02:00:44,239 --> 02:00:45,830
you can you can lose your hand and your
arm and leg you can have an artificial

6982
02:00:45,830 --> 02:00:45,840
arm and leg you can have an artificial
 

6983
02:00:45,840 --> 02:00:47,350
arm and leg you can have an artificial
heart

6984
02:00:47,350 --> 02:00:47,360
heart
 

6985
02:00:47,360 --> 02:00:49,669

you can't operate without your brain and

6986
02:00:49,669 --> 02:00:49,679
you can't operate without your brain and
 

6987
02:00:49,679 --> 02:00:50,550
you can't operate without your brain and
so when

6988
02:00:50,550 --> 02:00:50,560
so when
 

6989
02:00:50,560 --> 02:00:52,310
so when
you make that trade-off decision of

6990
02:00:52,310 --> 02:00:52,320
you make that trade-off decision of
 

6991
02:00:52,320 --> 02:00:54,070
you make that trade-off decision of
whether you're going to sleep under the

6992
02:00:54,070 --> 02:00:54,080
whether you're going to sleep under the
 

6993
02:00:54,080 --> 02:00:55,750
whether you're going to sleep under the
desk or not and go all out

6994
02:00:55,750 --> 02:00:55,760
desk or not and go all out
 

6995
02:00:55,760 --> 02:00:59,189
desk or not and go all out
for a four-day marathon

6996
02:00:59,189 --> 02:00:59,199
for a four-day marathon
 

6997
02:00:59,199 --> 02:01:01,669
for a four-day marathon
right there's a there's a cost-benefit

6998
02:01:01,669 --> 02:01:01,679
right there's a there's a cost-benefit
 

6999
02:01:01,679 --> 02:01:02,870
right there's a there's a cost-benefit
trade-off of what's going on what's

7000
02:01:02,870 --> 02:01:02,880
trade-off of what's going on what's
 

7001
02:01:02,880 --> 02:01:04,070
trade-off of what's going on what's
happening to your brain in that

7002
02:01:04,070 --> 02:01:04,080
happening to your brain in that
 

7003
02:01:04,080 --> 02:01:05,669
happening to your brain in that
situation

what's going on if we in how we're

02:01:18,790 --> 02:01:18,800
what's going on if we in how we're
 

7015
02:01:18,800 --> 02:01:19,910
what's going on if we in how we're
treating it today with

02:01:27,189 --> 02:01:27,199
and to me then if you say
 

7021
02:01:27,199 --> 02:01:28,950
and to me then if you say
that you're trying to you're you're

02:01:28,950 --> 02:01:28,960
that you're trying to you're you're
 

7023

things you're trying to do the game is
 

7027
02:01:33,920 --> 02:01:35,830
things you're trying to do the game is
soon with the progress in anti-aging and

7028
02:01:35,830 --> 02:01:35,840
soon with the progress in anti-aging and
 

7029
02:01:35,840 --> 02:01:37,510
soon with the progress in anti-aging and
biology the game is very soon going to

7030
02:01:37,510 --> 02:01:37,520
biology the game is very soon going to
 

7031
02:01:37,520 --> 02:01:38,550
biology the game is very soon going to
become different than what it is right

7032
02:01:38,550 --> 02:01:38,560
become different than what it is right
 

7033
02:01:38,560 --> 02:01:39,750
become different than what it is right
now

7034
02:01:39,750 --> 02:01:39,760
now
 

7035
02:01:39,760 --> 02:01:41,430
now
uh with organ rejuvenation organ

7036
02:01:41,430 --> 02:01:41,440
uh with organ rejuvenation organ
 

7037
02:01:41,440 --> 02:01:43,430
uh with organ rejuvenation organ
replacement and

replacement and
 

7039
02:01:43,440 --> 02:01:47,109

i'm i would conjecture that

02:01:47,109 --> 02:01:47,119
i'm i would conjecture that
 

7041
02:01:47,119 --> 02:01:50,229
i'm i would conjecture that
we will value the health status of our

7045
02:01:50,880 --> 02:01:53,910

above all things yeah no absolutely

7046
02:01:53,910 --> 02:01:53,920
above all things yeah no absolutely
 

7047
02:01:53,920 --> 02:01:57,270
above all things yeah no absolutely
everything's you're saying is true but i

7048
02:01:57,270 --> 02:01:57,280
everything's you're saying is true but i
 

7049
02:01:57,280 --> 02:02:00,149
everything's you're saying is true but i
we die we die pretty quickly life is

7050
02:02:00,149 --> 02:02:00,159
we die we die pretty quickly life is
 

7051
02:02:00,159 --> 02:02:01,109
we die we die pretty quickly life is
short

7052
02:02:01,109 --> 02:02:01,119
short
 

7053
02:02:01,119 --> 02:02:06,390
short
and i'm one of those people that uh

7054
02:02:06,390 --> 02:02:06,400
and i'm one of those people that uh
 

7055
02:02:06,400 --> 02:02:09,189
and i'm one of those people that uh
i would rather die in battle than uh

7056
02:02:09,189 --> 02:02:09,199
i would rather die in battle than uh
 

7057
02:02:09,199 --> 02:02:09,910
i would rather die in battle than uh
then stay

7058
02:02:09,910 --> 02:02:09,920
then stay
 

7059
02:02:09,920 --> 02:02:13,109
then stay
safe at home it's like yeah

7060
02:02:13,109 --> 02:02:13,119
safe at home it's like yeah
 

7061
02:02:13,119 --> 02:02:15,350
safe at home it's like yeah
you you look at kind of there's a lot of

7062
02:02:15,350 --> 02:02:15,360
you you look at kind of there's a lot of
 

7063
02:02:15,360 --> 02:02:17,270
you you look at kind of there's a lot of
things that you can reasonably say that

7064
02:02:17,270 --> 02:02:17,280
things that you can reasonably say that
 

7065
02:02:17,280 --> 02:02:18,950
things that you can reasonably say that
this is the smart thing to do

7066
02:02:18,950 --> 02:02:18,960
this is the smart thing to do
 

7067
02:02:18,960 --> 02:02:20,790
this is the smart thing to do
that can prevent you that becomes

7068
02:02:20,790 --> 02:02:20,800
that can prevent you that becomes
 

7069
02:02:20,800 --> 02:02:22,629
that can prevent you that becomes
conservative that can prevent you from

7070
02:02:22,629 --> 02:02:22,639
conservative that can prevent you from
 

7071
02:02:22,639 --> 02:02:24,310
conservative that can prevent you from
fully embracing life

7072
02:02:24,310 --> 02:02:24,320
fully embracing life
 

7073
02:02:24,320 --> 02:02:26,790
fully embracing life
i think ultimately you can be very

7074
02:02:26,790 --> 02:02:26,800
i think ultimately you can be very
 

7075
02:02:26,800 --> 02:02:27,510
i think ultimately you can be very
intelligent

7076
02:02:27,510 --> 02:02:27,520
intelligent
 

7077
02:02:27,520 --> 02:02:30,709

and data driven and also embrace life

and data driven and also embrace life
 

7079
02:02:30,719 --> 02:02:33,669

it's very

02:03:38,800 --> 02:03:43,589
more precise
than i am but i think i tend to want to

7142
02:03:43,589 --> 02:03:43,599
than i am but i think i tend to want to
 

7143
02:03:43,599 --> 02:03:47,430
than i am but i think i tend to want to
minimize stress

7144
02:03:47,430 --> 02:03:47,440

 

7145
02:03:47,440 --> 02:03:49,350

which everything comes into that from

7146
02:03:49,350 --> 02:03:49,360
which everything comes into that from
 

7147
02:03:49,360 --> 02:03:50,790
which everything comes into that from
your sleep and all those kinds of things

7148
02:03:50,790 --> 02:03:50,800
your sleep and all those kinds of things
 

7149
02:03:50,800 --> 02:03:51,910
your sleep and all those kinds of things
but

7150
02:03:51,910 --> 02:03:51,920
but
 

7151
02:03:51,920 --> 02:03:53,910
but
i worry that whenever i'm trying to be

7152
02:03:53,910 --> 02:03:53,920
i worry that whenever i'm trying to be
 

7153
02:03:53,920 --> 02:03:56,629
i worry that whenever i'm trying to be
too strict with myself then the stress

7154
02:03:56,629 --> 02:03:56,639
too strict with myself then the stress
 

7155
02:03:56,639 --> 02:03:57,669
too strict with myself then the stress
goes up

7156
02:03:57,669 --> 02:03:57,679
goes up
 

7157
02:03:57,679 --> 02:04:00,550
goes up
when i don't follow the strictness and

7158
02:04:00,550 --> 02:04:00,560
when i don't follow the strictness and
 

7159
02:04:00,560 --> 02:04:01,270
when i don't follow the strictness and
so

7160
02:04:01,270 --> 02:04:01,280
so
 

7161
02:04:01,280 --> 02:04:03,510
so
you have to kind of it's a weird it's a

7162
02:04:03,510 --> 02:04:03,520
you have to kind of it's a weird it's a
 

7163
02:04:03,520 --> 02:04:04,870
you have to kind of it's a weird it's a
there's so many variables in an

02:04:04,870 --> 02:04:04,880
there's so many variables in an
 

7165
02:04:04,880 --> 02:04:06,069
there's so many variables in an
objective function as

7166
02:04:06,069 --> 02:04:06,079
objective function as
 

7167
02:04:06,079 --> 02:04:08,149
objective function as
it's hard to get right and sort of not

7168
02:04:08,149 --> 02:04:08,159
it's hard to get right and sort of not
 

7169
02:04:08,159 --> 02:04:10,149
it's hard to get right and sort of not
giving a damn about sleep and not giving

it'd be nice if somebody else was doing
 

7191
02:04:25,520 --> 02:04:27,270
it'd be nice if somebody else was doing
it and had much better data

it and had much better data
 

7193
02:04:27,280 --> 02:04:28,709
it and had much better data
than uh because i don't trust my

uh there's no point to anything i just
 

7203
02:04:38,159 --> 02:04:40,870
uh there's no point to anything i just
said

7204

7205
02:04:40,880 --> 02:04:44,149

what what is the nature of your regret

7206
02:04:44,149 --> 02:04:44,159
what what is the nature of your regret
 

7207
02:04:44,159 --> 02:04:47,910
what what is the nature of your regret
on the brisket is it do you wish you

you hadn't as much as you did is it
 

7215
02:04:52,320 --> 02:04:56,069
you hadn't as much as you did is it
that i think uh

7216
02:04:56,069 --> 02:04:56,079
that i think uh
 

7217
02:04:56,079 --> 02:04:59,189
that i think uh
well the most regret i mean if we

7218
02:04:59,189 --> 02:04:59,199
well the most regret i mean if we
 

7219
02:04:59,199 --> 02:05:02,470
well the most regret i mean if we
want to be specific i drank

7220
02:05:02,470 --> 02:05:02,480
want to be specific i drank
 

7221
02:05:02,480 --> 02:05:05,669
want to be specific i drank
way too much like diet soda my biggest

7222
02:05:05,669 --> 02:05:05,679
way too much like diet soda my biggest
 

7223
02:05:05,679 --> 02:05:07,430
way too much like diet soda my biggest
regret is like having drank so much diet

7224
02:05:07,430 --> 02:05:07,440
regret is like having drank so much diet
 

7225
02:05:07,440 --> 02:05:08,149

soda
 

7227

soda
that's the thing that really was the

7228
02:05:09,669 --> 02:05:09,679
that's the thing that really was the
 

7229
02:05:09,679 --> 02:05:11,430
that's the thing that really was the
problem i had trouble sleeping because

7230
02:05:11,430 --> 02:05:11,440
problem i had trouble sleeping because
 

7231
02:05:11,440 --> 02:05:11,990
problem i had trouble sleeping because
of that

7232
02:05:11,990 --> 02:05:12,000
of that
 

7233
02:05:12,000 --> 02:05:13,669
of that
because i was like programming and then

7234
02:05:13,669 --> 02:05:13,679
because i was like programming and then
 

7235
02:05:13,679 --> 02:05:15,350
because i was like programming and then
i was editing and so i stayed up late at

7236
02:05:15,350 --> 02:05:15,360
i was editing and so i stayed up late at
 

7237
02:05:15,360 --> 02:05:16,790
i was editing and so i stayed up late at
night and then i had to get up to

7238
02:05:16,790 --> 02:05:16,800
night and then i had to get up to
 

7239
02:05:16,800 --> 02:05:18,950
night and then i had to get up to
to go pee a few times and it was just a

7240
02:05:18,950 --> 02:05:18,960
to go pee a few times and it was just a
 

7241
02:05:18,960 --> 02:05:20,310
to go pee a few times and it was just a
mess and the mess of the night

7242
02:05:20,310 --> 02:05:20,320
mess and the mess of the night
 

7243
02:05:20,320 --> 02:05:23,109
mess and the mess of the night
it was well it's not really a mess but

7244
02:05:23,109 --> 02:05:23,119
it was well it's not really a mess but
 

7245
02:05:23,119 --> 02:05:24,310
it was well it's not really a mess but
like it's so many

7246
02:05:24,310 --> 02:05:24,320
like it's so many
 

7247
02:05:24,320 --> 02:05:26,550
like it's so many
it's like the little things i know if i

7248
02:05:26,550 --> 02:05:26,560
it's like the little things i know if i
 

7249
02:05:26,560 --> 02:05:27,910
it's like the little things i know if i
just

7250
02:05:27,910 --> 02:05:27,920
just
 

7251
02:05:27,920 --> 02:05:30,069
just
eat i i drink a little bit of water and

7252
02:05:30,069 --> 02:05:30,079
eat i i drink a little bit of water and
 

7253
02:05:30,079 --> 02:05:31,030
eat i i drink a little bit of water and
that's it and

7254
02:05:31,030 --> 02:05:31,040
that's it and
 

7255
02:05:31,040 --> 02:05:34,069
that's it and
there's a certain all of us have perfect

7256
02:05:34,069 --> 02:05:34,079
there's a certain all of us have perfect
 

7257
02:05:34,079 --> 02:05:34,950
there's a certain all of us have perfect
days

7258
02:05:34,950 --> 02:05:34,960
days
 

7259
02:05:34,960 --> 02:05:37,350
days
that we know diet wise and so on that's

7260
02:05:37,350 --> 02:05:37,360
that we know diet wise and so on that's
 

7261
02:05:37,360 --> 02:05:39,030
that we know diet wise and so on that's
good to follow you feel good

7262
02:05:39,030 --> 02:05:39,040
good to follow you feel good
 

7263
02:05:39,040 --> 02:05:41,750
good to follow you feel good
i know what it takes for me to do that i

7264
02:05:41,750 --> 02:05:41,760
i know what it takes for me to do that i
 

7265
02:05:41,760 --> 02:05:43,030
i know what it takes for me to do that i
didn't fully do that

7266
02:05:43,030 --> 02:05:43,040
didn't fully do that
 

7267
02:05:43,040 --> 02:05:46,310
didn't fully do that
and thereby because there's there's an

7268
02:05:46,310 --> 02:05:46,320
and thereby because there's there's an
 

7269

avalanche effect where the other sources

avalanche effect where the other sources

of stress

all the other to do items i have pile on
my failure to execute on some basic

my failure to execute on some basic

all that combines

all that combines

but some of that chaos you know you have

optimization really what you're saying

7542
02:10:39,589 --> 02:10:39,599
optimization really what you're saying
 

7543
02:10:39,599 --> 02:10:40,310
optimization really what you're saying
though if we're

7544
02:10:40,310 --> 02:10:40,320
though if we're
 

7545
02:10:40,320 --> 02:10:42,229
though if we're
looking at this let's say from a first

7546
02:10:42,229 --> 02:10:42,239
looking at this let's say from a first
 

7547
02:10:42,239 --> 02:10:43,430
looking at this let's say from a first
principal's perspective

7548
02:10:43,430 --> 02:10:43,440
principal's perspective
 

7549
02:10:43,440 --> 02:10:45,189
principal's perspective
when you read those words they conjure

7550
02:10:45,189 --> 02:10:45,199
when you read those words they conjure
 

7551
02:10:45,199 --> 02:10:46,470
when you read those words they conjure
up certain life experiences

7552
02:10:46,470 --> 02:10:46,480
up certain life experiences
 

7553
02:10:46,480 --> 02:10:48,149
up certain life experiences
but you're basically saying i experience

7554
02:10:48,149 --> 02:10:48,159
but you're basically saying i experience
 

7555
02:10:48,159 --> 02:10:50,390
but you're basically saying i experience
a certain neurotransmitter state

7556
02:10:50,390 --> 02:10:50,400
a certain neurotransmitter state
 

7557
02:10:50,400 --> 02:10:52,870
a certain neurotransmitter state
when these things are an action yeah

7558
02:10:52,870 --> 02:10:52,880
when these things are an action yeah
 

7559
02:10:52,880 --> 02:10:53,910
when these things are an action yeah
that's all you're saying

7560
02:10:53,910 --> 02:10:53,920
that's all you're saying
 

7561
02:10:53,920 --> 02:10:55,189
that's all you're saying
so whether it's that or something else

7562
02:10:55,189 --> 02:10:55,199
so whether it's that or something else
 

7563
02:10:55,199 --> 02:10:57,109
so whether it's that or something else
you're just saying you have a selection

7564
02:10:57,109 --> 02:10:57,119
you're just saying you have a selection
 

7565
02:10:57,119 --> 02:10:57,830
you're just saying you have a selection
for how

7566
02:10:57,830 --> 02:10:57,840
for how
 

7567
02:10:57,840 --> 02:11:00,390
for how
your state for your body and so if you

7568
02:11:00,390 --> 02:11:00,400
your state for your body and so if you
 

7569
02:11:00,400 --> 02:11:01,189
your state for your body and so if you
as an engineer

7570
02:11:01,189 --> 02:11:01,199
as an engineer
 

7571
02:11:01,199 --> 02:11:03,510
as an engineer
of consciousness that should just be

7572
02:11:03,510 --> 02:11:03,520
of consciousness that should just be
 

7573
02:11:03,520 --> 02:11:05,109
of consciousness that should just be
engineerable

7574
02:11:05,109 --> 02:11:05,119
engineerable
 

7575
02:11:05,119 --> 02:11:06,709
engineerable
and that's just triggering certain

7576
02:11:06,709 --> 02:11:06,719
and that's just triggering certain
 

7577
02:11:06,719 --> 02:11:08,149
and that's just triggering certain
chemical reactions

7578
02:11:08,149 --> 02:11:08,159
chemical reactions
 

7579
02:11:08,159 --> 02:11:10,069
chemical reactions
and so whether so it doesn't mean they

7580
02:11:10,069 --> 02:11:10,079
and so whether so it doesn't mean they
 

7581
02:11:10,079 --> 02:11:11,589
and so whether so it doesn't mean they
have to be mutually exclusive you can

7582
02:11:11,589 --> 02:11:11,599
have to be mutually exclusive you can
 

7583
02:11:11,599 --> 02:11:12,229
have to be mutually exclusive you can
have that

7584
02:11:12,229 --> 02:11:12,239
have that
 

7585
02:11:12,239 --> 02:11:14,229
have that
and experience that and also not

7586
02:11:14,229 --> 02:11:14,239
and experience that and also not
 

7587
02:11:14,239 --> 02:11:15,990
and experience that and also not
sacrifice long-term health and i think

7588
02:11:15,990 --> 02:11:16,000
sacrifice long-term health and i think
 

7589
02:11:16,000 --> 02:11:17,189
sacrifice long-term health and i think
that's the potential of where we're

7590
02:11:17,189 --> 02:11:17,199
that's the potential of where we're
 

7591
02:11:17,199 --> 02:11:18,149
that's the potential of where we're
going is

7592
02:11:18,149 --> 02:11:18,159
going is
 

7593
02:11:18,159 --> 02:11:21,910
going is
we don't have we don't have to assume

7594
02:11:21,910 --> 02:11:21,920
we don't have we don't have to assume
 

7595
02:11:21,920 --> 02:11:25,669
we don't have we don't have to assume
they are trade-offs that must be had

7596
02:11:25,669 --> 02:11:25,679
they are trade-offs that must be had
 

7597
02:11:25,679 --> 02:11:27,589
they are trade-offs that must be had
absolutely and so i guess for my

7598
02:11:27,589 --> 02:11:27,599
absolutely and so i guess for my
 

7599
02:11:27,599 --> 02:11:28,870
absolutely and so i guess for my
particular brain

7600
02:11:28,870 --> 02:11:28,880
particular brain
 

7601
02:11:28,880 --> 02:11:30,790
particular brain
it's useful to have the outlier

7602
02:11:30,790 --> 02:11:30,800
it's useful to have the outlier
 

7603
02:11:30,800 --> 02:11:32,069
it's useful to have the outlier
experiences

7604
02:11:32,069 --> 02:11:32,079
experiences
 

7605
02:11:32,079 --> 02:11:34,470
experiences
that also come along with the uh

7606
02:11:34,470 --> 02:11:34,480
that also come along with the uh
 

7607
02:11:34,480 --> 02:11:36,229
that also come along with the uh
illusion of free will where i chose

7608
02:11:36,229 --> 02:11:36,239
illusion of free will where i chose
 

7609
02:11:36,239 --> 02:11:37,830
illusion of free will where i chose
those

7610
02:11:37,830 --> 02:11:37,840
those
 

7611
02:11:37,840 --> 02:11:39,510
those
that make me feel like it's freedom

7612
02:11:39,510 --> 02:11:39,520
that make me feel like it's freedom
 

7613
02:11:39,520 --> 02:11:41,990
that make me feel like it's freedom

8105
02:20:09,600 --> 02:20:10,950
trail was very bumpy so they'd go over
these big rocks and so my head would

8106
02:20:10,950 --> 02:20:10,960
these big rocks and so my head would
 

8107
02:20:10,960 --> 02:20:11,830
these big rocks and so my head would
just slam

8108
02:20:11,830 --> 02:20:11,840
just slam
 

8109
02:20:11,840 --> 02:20:14,790

against this metal thing for hours and
 

8111
02:20:14,800 --> 02:20:16,389
against this metal thing for hours and
so i just felt awful plus i'd get my

8112
02:20:16,389 --> 02:20:16,399
so i just felt awful plus i'd get my
 

8113
02:20:16,399 --> 02:20:18,150
so i just felt awful plus i'd get my
head slammed every couple seconds

8114

it that was the demarcation of me
basically

mountains are magical to me uh
i didn't expect that i didn't design

8196
02:21:50,870 --> 02:21:50,880
i didn't expect that i didn't design
 

8197
02:21:50,880 --> 02:21:52,309
i didn't expect that i didn't design
that i didn't know that was gonna be the

8198
02:21:52,309 --> 02:21:52,319
that i didn't know that was gonna be the
 

8199
02:21:52,319 --> 02:21:52,790
that i didn't know that was gonna be the
case

8200
02:21:52,790 --> 02:21:52,800
case
 

8201
02:21:52,800 --> 02:21:54,630
case
i and not it would not have been

8202
02:21:54,630 --> 02:21:54,640
i and not it would not have been
 

8203
02:21:54,640 --> 02:21:57,990
i and not it would not have been
something i would have anticipated

8204
02:21:57,990 --> 02:21:58,000

 

8205
02:21:58,000 --> 02:22:02,710

but you are not the same man afterwards

8206
02:22:02,710 --> 02:22:02,720

 

8207
02:22:02,720 --> 02:22:05,670

is there advice you can give to uh young

8208
02:22:05,670 --> 02:22:05,680
is there advice you can give to uh young
 

8209
02:22:05,680 --> 02:22:07,270
is there advice you can give to uh young
people today that look at your story

8210
02:22:07,270 --> 02:22:07,280
people today that look at your story
 

8211
02:22:07,280 --> 02:22:10,150
people today that look at your story
that's successful in many dimensions

8212
02:22:10,150 --> 02:22:10,160
that's successful in many dimensions
 

8213
02:22:10,160 --> 02:22:12,389
that's successful in many dimensions
um advice you can give to them about how

8214
02:22:12,389 --> 02:22:12,399
um advice you can give to them about how
 

8215
02:22:12,399 --> 02:22:13,990
um advice you can give to them about how
to be successful in their career

8216
02:22:13,990 --> 02:22:14,000
to be successful in their career
 

8217

02:22:17,270 --> 02:22:17,280
successful in life whatever path they
 

8219
02:22:17,280 --> 02:22:18,790
successful in life whatever path they
choose

8220
02:22:18,790 --> 02:22:18,800
choose
 

8221
02:22:18,800 --> 02:22:22,469
choose
yes i would say listen to advice

8222
02:22:22,469 --> 02:22:22,479
yes i would say listen to advice
 

8223
02:22:22,479 --> 02:22:26,389
yes i would say listen to advice
and see it for what it is a mirror

8224
02:22:26,389 --> 02:22:26,399
and see it for what it is a mirror
 

8225
02:22:26,399 --> 02:22:29,670
and see it for what it is a mirror
of that person and then map

8226
02:22:29,670 --> 02:22:29,680
of that person and then map
 

8227
02:22:29,680 --> 02:22:32,469
of that person and then map
and know that your future is going to be

8228
02:22:32,469 --> 02:22:32,479
and know that your future is going to be
 

8229
02:22:32,479 --> 02:22:34,710
and know that your future is going to be
in a zeroth principle land

8230
02:22:34,710 --> 02:22:34,720
in a zeroth principle land
 

8231
02:22:34,720 --> 02:22:37,030
in a zeroth principle land
and so what you're hearing today is a

8232
02:22:37,030 --> 02:22:37,040
and so what you're hearing today is a
 

8233
02:22:37,040 --> 02:22:37,990
and so what you're hearing today is a
representation

8234
02:22:37,990 --> 02:22:38,000
representation
 

8235
02:22:38,000 --> 02:22:39,270
representation
of what may have been the right

8236
02:22:39,270 --> 02:22:39,280
of what may have been the right
 

8237
02:22:39,280 --> 02:22:41,190
of what may have been the right
principles to build upon previously

8238
02:22:41,190 --> 02:22:41,200
principles to build upon previously
 

8239
02:22:41,200 --> 02:22:44,870
principles to build upon previously
but they're likely depreciating very

8240
02:22:44,870 --> 02:22:44,880
but they're likely depreciating very
 

8241
02:22:44,880 --> 02:22:45,590
but they're likely depreciating very
fast

8242
02:22:45,590 --> 02:22:45,600
fast
 

8243
02:22:45,600 --> 02:22:49,110
fast
and so i am a strong proponent

8244
02:22:49,110 --> 02:22:49,120
and so i am a strong proponent
 

8245
02:22:49,120 --> 02:22:53,510
and so i am a strong proponent
that people ask for advice but they

8246
02:22:53,510 --> 02:22:53,520
that people ask for advice but they
 

8247
02:22:53,520 --> 02:22:57,110
that people ask for advice but they
don't take advice

8248
02:22:57,110 --> 02:22:57,120

 

8249
02:22:57,120 --> 02:23:00,790

so how do you take advice properly

8250
02:23:00,790 --> 02:23:00,800
so how do you take advice properly
 

8251
02:23:00,800 --> 02:23:02,550
so how do you take advice properly
it's in the careful examination of the

8252
02:23:02,550 --> 02:23:02,560
it's in the careful examination of the
 

8253
02:23:02,560 --> 02:23:04,790
it's in the careful examination of the
advice it's it's actually you

8254
02:23:04,790 --> 02:23:04,800
advice it's it's actually you
 

8255
02:23:04,800 --> 02:23:06,870
advice it's it's actually you
the person makes a statement about a

8256
02:23:06,870 --> 02:23:06,880
the person makes a statement about a
 

8257
02:23:06,880 --> 02:23:09,030
the person makes a statement about a
given thing somebody should follow

8258
02:23:09,030 --> 02:23:09,040
given thing somebody should follow
 

8259
02:23:09,040 --> 02:23:11,190
given thing somebody should follow
the value is not doing that the value is

8260
02:23:11,190 --> 02:23:11,200
the value is not doing that the value is
 

8261
02:23:11,200 --> 02:23:13,110
the value is not doing that the value is
understanding the assumption stack they

8262
02:23:13,110 --> 02:23:13,120
understanding the assumption stack they
 

8263
02:23:13,120 --> 02:23:14,710
understanding the assumption stack they
built the assumption and knowledge stack

8264
02:23:14,710 --> 02:23:14,720

02:24:25,280 --> 02:24:26,790
on people at a particular moment of time
that changed everything

8334
02:24:26,790 --> 02:24:26,800
that changed everything
 

8335
02:24:26,800 --> 02:24:29,510
that changed everything
yeah the most significant moments of my

8336
02:24:29,510 --> 02:24:29,520
yeah the most significant moments of my

02:24:29,520 --> 02:24:30,710
yeah the most significant moments of my
memory

8338

memory
 

8339
02:24:30,720 --> 02:24:34,070
memory
for example like on kilimanjaro when ike

8340
02:24:34,070 --> 02:24:34,080
for example like on kilimanjaro when ike
 

8341
02:24:34,080 --> 02:24:38,150
for example like on kilimanjaro when ike
some person i'd never met in tanzania

some person i'd never met in tanzania
 

8343
02:24:38,160 --> 02:24:40,469
some person i'd never met in tanzania
was able to in that moment apparently

8344
02:24:40,469 --> 02:24:40,479
was able to in that moment apparently
 

8345
02:24:40,479 --> 02:24:41,750
was able to in that moment apparently
see my soul

8346
02:24:41,750 --> 02:24:41,760
see my soul
 

8347
02:24:41,760 --> 02:24:43,349
see my soul
when i was in this death match with

8348
02:24:43,349 --> 02:24:43,359
when i was in this death match with
 

8349
02:24:43,359 --> 02:24:44,950
when i was in this death match with
reality yes

8350
02:24:44,950 --> 02:24:44,960
reality yes
 

8351
02:24:44,960 --> 02:24:48,150
reality yes
and he gave me the instructions look up

8352
02:24:48,150 --> 02:24:48,160
and he gave me the instructions look up
 

8353
02:24:48,160 --> 02:24:51,670
and he gave me the instructions look up
step and so

8354
02:24:51,670 --> 02:24:51,680

 

8355
02:24:51,680 --> 02:24:54,790

there's magical people in my life

8356
02:24:54,790 --> 02:24:54,800
there's magical people in my life
 

8357
02:24:54,800 --> 02:24:58,950
there's magical people in my life
that have done things like that and

8358
02:24:58,950 --> 02:24:58,960
that have done things like that and
 

8359
02:24:58,960 --> 02:25:02,150
that have done things like that and
i suspect they probably don't know i

8360
02:25:02,150 --> 02:25:02,160
i suspect they probably don't know i
 

8361
02:25:02,160 --> 02:25:03,349
i suspect they probably don't know i
i probably should be better at

8362
02:25:03,349 --> 02:25:03,359
i probably should be better at
 

8363
02:25:03,359 --> 02:25:06,389
i probably should be better at
identifying those things and

8364
02:25:06,389 --> 02:25:06,399
identifying those things and
 

8365
02:25:06,399 --> 02:25:15,830
identifying those things and
but yeah hopefully them

8366
02:25:15,830 --> 02:25:15,840

 

8367
02:25:15,840 --> 02:25:18,070

i suppose like the wisdom i would aspire

i actually kind of experienced i think
 

8389
02:25:47,600 --> 02:25:49,190
i actually kind of experienced i think
about that sometimes you know you have

8390

about that sometimes you know you have
 

8391
02:25:49,200 --> 02:25:54,469
about that sometimes you know you have
like a 18 year old kid come up to you

it's not always obvious it's not always
easy

8396
02:25:57,670 --> 02:25:57,680
easy
 

8397
02:25:57,680 --> 02:26:00,870
easy
to really listen to them like not

02:26:30,960 --> 02:26:33,030
so when giving advice there's something
to that so both sides should be

8430
02:26:33,030 --> 02:26:33,040
to that so both sides should be
 

8431
02:26:33,040 --> 02:26:34,710
to that so both sides should be
deeply empathetic about the assumption

8432
02:26:34,710 --> 02:26:34,720
deeply empathetic about the assumption
 

8433

you had this very eloquent way of

8448
02:26:50,550 --> 02:26:50,560
you had this very eloquent way of
 

8449
02:26:50,560 --> 02:26:52,070
you had this very eloquent way of
describing life on earth as

describing life on earth as
 

8451

02:27:02,880 --> 02:27:06,630

through building through our technology

8462
02:27:06,630 --> 02:27:06,640
through building through our technology
 

8463
02:27:06,640 --> 02:27:07,190
through building through our technology
building

8464
02:27:07,190 --> 02:27:07,200
building
 

8465
02:27:07,200 --> 02:27:09,670
building
more and more intelligent systems you

8466
02:27:09,670 --> 02:27:09,680
more and more intelligent systems you
 

8467
02:27:09,680 --> 02:27:11,270
more and more intelligent systems you
ever ask yourself

8468
02:27:11,270 --> 02:27:11,280
ever ask yourself
 

8469
02:27:11,280 --> 02:27:14,830
ever ask yourself
why is doing that yeah i think the

8470
02:27:14,830 --> 02:27:14,840
why is doing that yeah i think the
 

8471
02:27:14,840 --> 02:27:18,309
why is doing that yeah i think the
answer to this question again the

8472
02:27:18,309 --> 02:27:18,319
answer to this question again the
 

8473
02:27:18,319 --> 02:27:21,590
answer to this question again the
information value is more in the mirror

8474
02:27:21,590 --> 02:27:21,600
information value is more in the mirror
 

8475
02:27:21,600 --> 02:27:24,550
information value is more in the mirror
it provides of that person which is a

8476
02:27:24,550 --> 02:27:24,560
it provides of that person which is a
 

8477
02:27:24,560 --> 02:27:25,590
it provides of that person which is a
representation

8478
02:27:25,590 --> 02:27:25,600
representation
 

8479
02:27:25,600 --> 02:27:28,630
representation
of the technological social political

8480
02:27:28,630 --> 02:27:28,640
of the technological social political
 

8481
02:27:28,640 --> 02:27:30,790
of the technological social political
context of the time so if you asked this

8482
02:27:30,790 --> 02:27:30,800
context of the time so if you asked this
 

8483
02:27:30,800 --> 02:27:32,150
context of the time so if you asked this
question a hundred years ago

8484
02:27:32,150 --> 02:27:32,160
question a hundred years ago
 

8485
02:27:32,160 --> 02:27:33,429
question a hundred years ago
you would get a certain answer that

8486
02:27:33,429 --> 02:27:33,439
you would get a certain answer that
 

8487
02:27:33,439 --> 02:27:35,270
you would get a certain answer that
reflects that time period same thing

8488
02:27:35,270 --> 02:27:35,280
reflects that time period same thing
 

8489
02:27:35,280 --> 02:27:36,870
reflects that time period same thing
would be true over a thousand years ago

8490
02:27:36,870 --> 02:27:36,880
would be true over a thousand years ago
 

8491
02:27:36,880 --> 02:27:40,070
would be true over a thousand years ago
it's rare it's difficult for a person to

8492
02:27:40,070 --> 02:27:40,080
it's rare it's difficult for a person to
 

8493
02:27:40,080 --> 02:27:41,510
it's rare it's difficult for a person to
pull themselves out of their contextual

8494
02:27:41,510 --> 02:27:41,520
pull themselves out of their contextual
 

8495
02:27:41,520 --> 02:27:42,070
pull themselves out of their contextual
awareness

8496
02:27:42,070 --> 02:27:42,080
awareness
 

8497
02:27:42,080 --> 02:27:45,110
awareness
yeah and offer truly original response

8498
02:27:45,110 --> 02:27:45,120
yeah and offer truly original response
 

8499
02:27:45,120 --> 02:27:47,830
yeah and offer truly original response
and so knowing that i am contextually

8500
02:27:47,830 --> 02:27:47,840
and so knowing that i am contextually
 

8501
02:27:47,840 --> 02:27:49,990
and so knowing that i am contextually
influenced by the situation that i am

8502
02:27:49,990 --> 02:27:50,000
influenced by the situation that i am
 

8503
02:27:50,000 --> 02:27:52,790
influenced by the situation that i am
a mirror for our reality i would say

8504
02:27:52,790 --> 02:27:52,800
a mirror for our reality i would say
 

8505
02:27:52,800 --> 02:27:55,110
a mirror for our reality i would say
that in this moment

8506
02:27:55,110 --> 02:27:55,120
that in this moment
 

8507
02:27:55,120 --> 02:27:58,790
that in this moment
i think the real game going

8508
02:27:58,790 --> 02:27:58,800
i think the real game going
 

8509
02:27:58,800 --> 02:28:03,670
i think the real game going
on is

8510
02:28:03,670 --> 02:28:03,680

 

8511
02:28:03,680 --> 02:28:06,950

that in evolution

8512
02:28:06,950 --> 02:28:06,960
that in evolution
 

8513
02:28:06,960 --> 02:28:08,469
that in evolution
built a system of scaffolding

8514
02:28:08,469 --> 02:28:08,479
built a system of scaffolding
 

8515
02:28:08,479 --> 02:28:11,590
built a system of scaffolding
intelligence that produced us

8516
02:28:11,590 --> 02:28:11,600
intelligence that produced us
 

8517
02:28:11,600 --> 02:28:13,750
intelligence that produced us
we are now building intelligent systems

8518
02:28:13,750 --> 02:28:13,760
we are now building intelligent systems
 

8519
02:28:13,760 --> 02:28:16,790
we are now building intelligent systems
that are scaffolding

8520
02:28:16,790 --> 02:28:16,800

 

8521
02:28:16,800 --> 02:28:19,349

higher dimensional intelligence this is

8522
02:28:19,349 --> 02:28:19,359
higher dimensional intelligence this is
 

8523
02:28:19,359 --> 02:28:21,110
higher dimensional intelligence this is
developing

8524
02:28:21,110 --> 02:28:21,120
developing
 

8525
02:28:21,120 --> 02:28:27,910
developing
more robust systems of intelligence

8526
02:28:27,910 --> 02:28:27,920

 

8527
02:28:27,920 --> 02:28:31,349

in doing in that process with the cost

8528
02:28:31,349 --> 02:28:31,359
in doing in that process with the cost
 

8529
02:28:31,359 --> 02:28:32,630
in doing in that process with the cost
going to zero

8530
02:28:32,630 --> 02:28:32,640
going to zero
 

8531
02:28:32,640 --> 02:28:36,469
going to zero
then the meaning of life becomes

8532
02:28:36,469 --> 02:28:36,479
then the meaning of life becomes
 

8533
02:28:36,479 --> 02:28:40,389
then the meaning of life becomes
goal alignment which is the negotiation

8534
02:28:40,389 --> 02:28:40,399
goal alignment which is the negotiation
 

8535
02:28:40,399 --> 02:28:41,990
goal alignment which is the negotiation
of our conscious and unconscious

8536
02:28:41,990 --> 02:28:42,000
of our conscious and unconscious
 

8537
02:28:42,000 --> 02:28:43,510
of our conscious and unconscious
existence

8538
02:28:43,510 --> 02:28:43,520
existence
 

8539
02:28:43,520 --> 02:28:45,030
existence
and then i'd say the third thing is if

8540
02:28:45,030 --> 02:28:45,040
and then i'd say the third thing is if
 

8541
02:28:45,040 --> 02:28:46,790
and then i'd say the third thing is if
we're thinking that we want to be

8542
02:28:46,790 --> 02:28:46,800
we're thinking that we want to be
 

8543
02:28:46,800 --> 02:28:50,230
we're thinking that we want to be
explorers is

8544
02:28:50,230 --> 02:28:50,240
explorers is
 

8545
02:28:50,240 --> 02:28:51,990
explorers is
our technological progress is getting to

8546
02:28:51,990 --> 02:28:52,000
our technological progress is getting to
 

8547
02:28:52,000 --> 02:28:54,150
our technological progress is getting to
a point where

8548
02:28:54,150 --> 02:28:54,160
a point where
 

8549
02:28:54,160 --> 02:28:57,349
a point where
we could aspirationally say

8550
02:28:57,349 --> 02:28:57,359
we could aspirationally say
 

8551
02:28:57,359 --> 02:28:59,750
we could aspirationally say
we want to figure out what is really

8552
02:28:59,750 --> 02:28:59,760
we want to figure out what is really
 

8553
02:28:59,760 --> 02:29:01,429
we want to figure out what is really
going on

8554
02:29:01,429 --> 02:29:01,439
going on
 

8555
02:29:01,439 --> 02:29:04,950
going on
really going on because does any of this

8556
02:29:04,950 --> 02:29:04,960
really going on because does any of this
 

8557
02:29:04,960 --> 02:29:06,469
really going on because does any of this
really make sense

8558
02:29:06,469 --> 02:29:06,479
really make sense
 

8559
02:29:06,479 --> 02:29:08,630
really make sense
now we may be 100 200 500 a thousand

8560
02:29:08,630 --> 02:29:08,640
now we may be 100 200 500 a thousand
 

8561
02:29:08,640 --> 02:29:11,270
now we may be 100 200 500 a thousand
years away from being able to

8562
02:29:11,270 --> 02:29:11,280
years away from being able to
 

8563
02:29:11,280 --> 02:29:14,550
years away from being able to
poke our way out of whatever is is going

8564
02:29:14,550 --> 02:29:14,560
poke our way out of whatever is is going
 

8565
02:29:14,560 --> 02:29:15,910
poke our way out of whatever is is going
on

8566
02:29:15,910 --> 02:29:15,920
on
 

8567
02:29:15,920 --> 02:29:18,389
on
but it's interesting that we could even

8568
02:29:18,389 --> 02:29:18,399
but it's interesting that we could even
 

8569
02:29:18,399 --> 02:29:19,990
but it's interesting that we could even
state an aspiration

8570
02:29:19,990 --> 02:29:20,000
state an aspiration
 

8571
02:29:20,000 --> 02:29:22,870
state an aspiration
to say we want to poke at this question

8572
02:29:22,870 --> 02:29:22,880
to say we want to poke at this question
 

8573
02:29:22,880 --> 02:29:23,590
to say we want to poke at this question
but i'd say

8574
02:29:23,590 --> 02:29:23,600
but i'd say
 

8575
02:29:23,600 --> 02:29:26,950
but i'd say
in this moment of time the meaning of

8576
02:29:26,950 --> 02:29:26,960
in this moment of time the meaning of
 

8577
02:29:26,960 --> 02:29:27,830
in this moment of time the meaning of
life

8578
02:29:27,830 --> 02:29:27,840
life
 

8579
02:29:27,840 --> 02:29:31,750
life
is that we can build a future state

8580
02:29:31,750 --> 02:29:31,760
is that we can build a future state
 

8581
02:29:31,760 --> 02:29:35,349
is that we can build a future state
of existence that is more fantastic than

8582
02:29:35,349 --> 02:29:35,359
of existence that is more fantastic than
 

8583
02:29:35,359 --> 02:29:38,070
of existence that is more fantastic than
anything we could ever imagine the

8584
02:29:38,070 --> 02:29:38,080
anything we could ever imagine the
 

8585
02:29:38,080 --> 02:29:39,990
anything we could ever imagine the
striving

8586
02:29:39,990 --> 02:29:40,000
striving
 

8587
02:29:40,000 --> 02:29:43,510
striving
for something more amazing

8588
02:29:43,510 --> 02:29:43,520
for something more amazing
 

8589
02:29:43,520 --> 02:29:48,830
for something more amazing
and that defies expectations

8590
02:29:48,830 --> 02:29:48,840

 

8591
02:29:48,840 --> 02:29:52,630

that we would consider bewildering

8592
02:29:52,630 --> 02:29:52,640
that we would consider bewildering
 

8593
02:29:52,640 --> 02:29:55,990
that we would consider bewildering
and all the things that that that's and

8594
02:29:55,990 --> 02:29:56,000
