00:05:52,080 --> 00:05:54,950
it's kind of fascinating uh
principle an idea to try to simulate the

brain
 

341
00:05:55,440 --> 00:05:57,110
brain
as we're talking about the human brain

342
00:05:57,110 --> 00:05:57,120
as we're talking about the human brain
 

343
00:05:57,120 --> 00:05:58,950
as we're talking about the human brain
right right human brains

344
00:05:58,950 --> 00:05:58,960
right right human brains
 

345
00:05:58,960 --> 00:06:02,309
right right human brains
and rad brains or cat brains

346
00:06:02,309 --> 00:06:02,319
and rad brains or cat brains
 

347
00:06:02,319 --> 00:06:04,830
and rad brains or cat brains
have lots in common that the cortex the

348
00:06:04,830 --> 00:06:04,840
have lots in common that the cortex the
 

349
00:06:04,840 --> 00:06:06,870
have lots in common that the cortex the
neocortex structure

neocortex structure
 

351
00:06:06,880 --> 00:06:09,670
neocortex structure
is very similar so initially they were

352
00:06:09,670 --> 00:06:09,680
is very similar so initially they were
 

353
00:06:09,680 --> 00:06:10,950
is very similar so initially they were
trying to

354
00:06:10,950 --> 00:06:10,960
trying to
 

355
00:06:10,960 --> 00:06:14,710
trying to
just simulate a cat brain uh and uh

356
00:06:14,710 --> 00:06:14,720
just simulate a cat brain uh and uh
 

357
00:06:14,720 --> 00:06:17,189
just simulate a cat brain uh and uh
to understand the nature of evil they

358
00:06:17,189 --> 00:06:17,199
to understand the nature of evil they
 

359
00:06:17,199 --> 00:06:19,350
to understand the nature of evil they
understand the nature of evil

360
00:06:19,350 --> 00:06:19,360
understand the nature of evil
 

361
00:06:19,360 --> 00:06:21,670
understand the nature of evil
or uh as it happens in most of these

362
00:06:21,670 --> 00:06:21,680
or uh as it happens in most of these
 

363
00:06:21,680 --> 00:06:22,870
or uh as it happens in most of these
simulations

364
00:06:22,870 --> 00:06:22,880
simulations
 

365
00:06:22,880 --> 00:06:25,909
simulations
uh you you easily get one thing out

366
00:06:25,909 --> 00:06:25,919
uh you you easily get one thing out
 

367
00:06:25,919 --> 00:06:27,749
uh you you easily get one thing out
which is oscillations you know yeah if

368
00:06:27,749 --> 00:06:27,759
which is oscillations you know yeah if
 

369
00:06:27,759 --> 00:06:28,070
which is oscillations you know yeah if
you

370
00:06:28,070 --> 00:06:28,080
you
 

371
00:06:28,080 --> 00:06:29,909
you
if you simulate a large number of

372
00:06:29,909 --> 00:06:29,919
if you simulate a large number of
 

373
00:06:29,919 --> 00:06:31,189
if you simulate a large number of
neurons they

374
00:06:31,189 --> 00:06:31,199
neurons they
 

375
00:06:31,199 --> 00:06:33,990
neurons they
oscillate and you can adjust the

376
00:06:33,990 --> 00:06:34,000
oscillate and you can adjust the
 

377
00:06:34,000 --> 00:06:36,309
oscillate and you can adjust the
parameters and say that oh selections

378
00:06:36,309 --> 00:06:36,319
parameters and say that oh selections
 

379
00:06:36,319 --> 00:06:37,350
parameters and say that oh selections
match the

380
00:06:37,350 --> 00:06:37,360
match the
 

381
00:06:37,360 --> 00:06:39,909
match the
rhythm that we see in the brain etc but

382
00:06:39,909 --> 00:06:39,919
rhythm that we see in the brain etc but
 

383
00:06:39,919 --> 00:06:42,870
rhythm that we see in the brain etc but
uh oh i see so like uh so the idea is

384
00:06:42,870 --> 00:06:42,880
uh oh i see so like uh so the idea is
 

385
00:06:42,880 --> 00:06:45,110
uh oh i see so like uh so the idea is
uh is the simulation at the level of uh

386
00:06:45,110 --> 00:06:45,120
uh is the simulation at the level of uh
 

387
00:06:45,120 --> 00:06:46,870
uh is the simulation at the level of uh
individual neurons

388
00:06:46,870 --> 00:06:46,880
individual neurons
 

389
00:06:46,880 --> 00:06:49,189
individual neurons
yeah so the blue brain project the

390
00:06:49,189 --> 00:06:49,199
yeah so the blue brain project the
 

391
00:06:49,199 --> 00:06:49,909
yeah so the blue brain project the
original

idea as proposed was um you
 

395
00:06:53,199 --> 00:06:56,469
idea as proposed was um you
you put very detailed bio physical

396
00:06:56,469 --> 00:06:56,479
you put very detailed bio physical
 

397
00:06:56,479 --> 00:06:57,189
you put very detailed bio physical
neurons

398
00:06:57,189 --> 00:06:57,199

399
00:06:57,199 --> 00:07:00,390

uh bios physical models of neurons
 

401
00:07:00,400 --> 00:07:03,270
uh bios physical models of neurons
and you interconnect them according to

402
00:07:03,270 --> 00:07:03,280
and you interconnect them according to
 

403
00:07:03,280 --> 00:07:04,230
and you interconnect them according to
the

404
00:07:04,230 --> 00:07:04,240
the
 

405
00:07:04,240 --> 00:07:05,990
the

found from real neuroscience experiments
 

409
00:07:08,479 --> 00:07:11,830
found from real neuroscience experiments
and then uh turn it on and uh see what

410
00:07:11,830 --> 00:07:11,840
and then uh turn it on and uh see what
 

411
00:07:11,840 --> 00:07:12,390
and then uh turn it on and uh see what
happens

happens
 

413
00:07:12,400 --> 00:07:15,110
happens
uh and and these neural models are you

are about
 

427
00:07:26,080 --> 00:07:28,710
are about
how signals propagate in a cable and

428
00:07:28,710 --> 00:07:28,720
how signals propagate in a cable and
 

429
00:07:28,720 --> 00:07:29,510
how signals propagate in a cable and
there are

430
00:07:29,510 --> 00:07:29,520
there are
 

431
00:07:29,520 --> 00:07:31,830
there are
active dendrites all those phenomena

which
 

435
00:07:33,039 --> 00:07:34,390
which
those phenomena themselves we don't

436
00:07:34,390 --> 00:07:34,400
those phenomena themselves we don't
 

437
00:07:34,400 --> 00:07:36,870
those phenomena themselves we don't
understand that well uh and then

438
00:07:36,870 --> 00:07:36,880
understand that well uh and then
 

439
00:07:36,880 --> 00:07:39,909
understand that well uh and then
uh we put in connectivity which is part

440
00:07:39,909 --> 00:07:39,919
uh we put in connectivity which is part
 

441
00:07:39,919 --> 00:07:40,950
uh we put in connectivity which is part

00:07:43,520 --> 00:07:45,110
part you know observed and of course if
you do not have any theory about how it

446
00:07:45,110 --> 00:07:45,120
you do not have any theory about how it
 

447
00:07:45,120 --> 00:07:45,510
you do not have any theory about how it
is

448
00:07:45,510 --> 00:07:45,520
is
 

449
00:07:45,520 --> 00:07:48,710
is
supposed to work uh we

450
00:07:48,710 --> 00:07:48,720
supposed to work uh we
 

451
00:07:48,720 --> 00:07:51,270
supposed to work uh we
you know we just have to take whatever

452
00:07:51,270 --> 00:07:51,280
you know we just have to take whatever
 

453
00:07:51,280 --> 00:07:52,469
you know we just have to take whatever
comes out of it as

454

comes out of it as
 

455
00:07:52,479 --> 00:07:55,110
comes out of it as
okay this is something interesting but

456
00:07:55,110 --> 00:07:55,120
okay this is something interesting but
 

457
00:07:55,120 --> 00:07:56,950
okay this is something interesting but
in your sense like these models of the

458
00:07:56,950 --> 00:07:56,960
in your sense like these models of the
 

459
00:07:56,960 --> 00:07:58,230
in your sense like these models of the
way signal travels

460
00:07:58,230 --> 00:07:58,240
way signal travels
 

461
00:07:58,240 --> 00:08:00,869
way signal travels
along or like with the axons and all the

462
00:08:00,869 --> 00:08:00,879
along or like with the axons and all the
 

463
00:08:00,879 --> 00:08:01,830
along or like with the axons and all the
basic models

basic models
 

465
00:08:01,840 --> 00:08:04,869
basic models
that's they're too crude oh well

466
00:08:04,869 --> 00:08:04,879
that's they're too crude oh well
 

467
00:08:04,879 --> 00:08:05,589
that's they're too crude oh well
actually

468
00:08:05,589 --> 00:08:05,599
actually
 

469
00:08:05,599 --> 00:08:08,790
actually
they are pretty detailed and pretty

470
00:08:08,790 --> 00:08:08,800
they are pretty detailed and pretty
 

471
00:08:08,800 --> 00:08:10,309
they are pretty detailed and pretty
sophisticated

472
00:08:10,309 --> 00:08:10,319
sophisticated
 

473
00:08:10,319 --> 00:08:13,350
sophisticated
and they do replicate the

474
00:08:13,350 --> 00:08:13,360
and they do replicate the
 

475
00:08:13,360 --> 00:08:15,510
and they do replicate the
neural dynamics if you take a single

476
00:08:15,510 --> 00:08:15,520
neural dynamics if you take a single
 

477
00:08:15,520 --> 00:08:16,469

neuron
 

479
00:08:16,479 --> 00:08:19,670
neuron
and you you try to uh

480
00:08:19,670 --> 00:08:19,680
and you you try to uh
 

481
00:08:19,680 --> 00:08:21,029
and you you try to uh
turn on the different channels the

482
00:08:21,029 --> 00:08:21,039
turn on the different channels the
 

483
00:08:21,039 --> 00:08:22,790
turn on the different channels the
calcium channels and

484
00:08:22,790 --> 00:08:22,800
calcium channels and
 

485
00:08:22,800 --> 00:08:25,189
calcium channels and
uh the different receptors uh and see

486
00:08:25,189 --> 00:08:25,199
uh the different receptors uh and see
 

487
00:08:25,199 --> 00:08:26,070
uh the different receptors uh and see
what the effect

488
00:08:26,070 --> 00:08:26,080
what the effect
 

489
00:08:26,080 --> 00:08:28,950
what the effect
of uh turning on or off those channels

490
00:08:28,950 --> 00:08:28,960
of uh turning on or off those channels
 

491
00:08:28,960 --> 00:08:29,749
of uh turning on or off those channels
are

492
00:08:29,749 --> 00:08:29,759
are
 

493
00:08:29,759 --> 00:08:33,269
are
in the neurons spike output people have

494
00:08:33,269 --> 00:08:33,279
in the neurons spike output people have
 

495
00:08:33,279 --> 00:08:35,029
in the neurons spike output people have
built pretty sophisticated models of

496
00:08:35,029 --> 00:08:35,039
built pretty sophisticated models of
 

497
00:08:35,039 --> 00:08:35,670
built pretty sophisticated models of
that and

498
00:08:35,670 --> 00:08:35,680
that and
 

499
00:08:35,680 --> 00:08:38,949
that and
and they are i i would say um

500
00:08:38,949 --> 00:08:38,959
and they are i i would say um
 

501
00:08:38,959 --> 00:08:41,430
and they are i i would say um
you know in the regime of correct well

502
00:08:41,430 --> 00:08:41,440
you know in the regime of correct well
 

503
00:08:41,440 --> 00:08:42,469
you know in the regime of correct well
see the correctness

504
00:08:42,469 --> 00:08:42,479
see the correctness
 

505
00:08:42,479 --> 00:08:43,589
see the correctness
that's interesting because you've

506
00:08:43,589 --> 00:08:43,599
that's interesting because you've
 

507
00:08:43,599 --> 00:08:45,670
that's interesting because you've
mentioned in several levels uh

508
00:08:45,670 --> 00:08:45,680
mentioned in several levels uh
 

509
00:08:45,680 --> 00:08:47,350
mentioned in several levels uh
the correctness is measured by looking

510
00:08:47,350 --> 00:08:47,360
the correctness is measured by looking
 

511
00:08:47,360 --> 00:08:49,430
the correctness is measured by looking
at some kind of aggregate statistics

512
00:08:49,430 --> 00:08:49,440
at some kind of aggregate statistics
 

513
00:08:49,440 --> 00:08:52,310
at some kind of aggregate statistics
it would be more of the the spiking

514
00:08:52,310 --> 00:08:52,320
it would be more of the the spiking
 

515
00:08:52,320 --> 00:08:53,590
it would be more of the the spiking
dynamics

516
00:08:53,590 --> 00:08:53,600
dynamics
 

517
00:08:53,600 --> 00:08:56,949
dynamics
in dynamics yeah and and yeah these

518
00:08:56,949 --> 00:08:56,959
in dynamics yeah and and yeah these
 

519
00:08:56,959 --> 00:08:57,910
in dynamics yeah and and yeah these
models

520
00:08:57,910 --> 00:08:57,920
models
 

521
00:08:57,920 --> 00:08:59,430
models
because they are they are going to the

522
00:08:59,430 --> 00:08:59,440
because they are they are going to the
 

523
00:08:59,440 --> 00:09:01,350
because they are they are going to the
level of mechanism right so they are

524
00:09:01,350 --> 00:09:01,360
level of mechanism right so they are
 

525
00:09:01,360 --> 00:09:03,509
level of mechanism right so they are
basically looking at uh okay what what

526
00:09:03,509 --> 00:09:03,519
basically looking at uh okay what what
 

527
00:09:03,519 --> 00:09:04,550
basically looking at uh okay what what
is the effect of

528
00:09:04,550 --> 00:09:04,560
is the effect of
 

529
00:09:04,560 --> 00:09:07,829
is the effect of
turning on an ion channel uh and um

530
00:09:07,829 --> 00:09:07,839
turning on an ion channel uh and um
 

531
00:09:07,839 --> 00:09:09,670
turning on an ion channel uh and um
and you can you can model that using

532
00:09:09,670 --> 00:09:09,680
and you can you can model that using
 

533
00:09:09,680 --> 00:09:11,110
and you can you can model that using
electric circuits in

534
00:09:11,110 --> 00:09:11,120
electric circuits in
 

535
00:09:11,120 --> 00:09:13,990
electric circuits in
and then so they are model so it is not

536
00:09:13,990 --> 00:09:14,000
and then so they are model so it is not
 

537
00:09:14,000 --> 00:09:14,389
and then so they are model so it is not
just

538
00:09:14,389 --> 00:09:14,399
just
 

539
00:09:14,399 --> 00:09:17,110
just
a uh function fitting it is people are

540
00:09:17,110 --> 00:09:17,120
a uh function fitting it is people are
 

541
00:09:17,120 --> 00:09:19,190
a uh function fitting it is people are
looking at the mechanism underlying it

542
00:09:19,190 --> 00:09:19,200
looking at the mechanism underlying it
 

543
00:09:19,200 --> 00:09:22,070
looking at the mechanism underlying it
and uh putting that in terms of electric

544
00:09:22,070 --> 00:09:22,080
and uh putting that in terms of electric
 

545
00:09:22,080 --> 00:09:23,110
and uh putting that in terms of electric
circuit

546
00:09:23,110 --> 00:09:23,120
circuit
 

547
00:09:23,120 --> 00:09:25,509
circuit
theory signal propagation theory and and

548
00:09:25,509 --> 00:09:25,519
theory signal propagation theory and and
 

549
00:09:25,519 --> 00:09:27,030
theory signal propagation theory and and
modeling that and

550
00:09:27,030 --> 00:09:27,040
modeling that and
 

551
00:09:27,040 --> 00:09:29,829
modeling that and
so those models are sophisticated but

552
00:09:29,829 --> 00:09:29,839
so those models are sophisticated but
 

553
00:09:29,839 --> 00:09:31,110
so those models are sophisticated but
getting a

554
00:09:31,110 --> 00:09:31,120
getting a

single neurons model 99
 

557
00:09:34,320 --> 00:09:38,310
single neurons model 99
right does not still tell you how to

558
00:09:38,310 --> 00:09:38,320
right does not still tell you how to
 

559
00:09:38,320 --> 00:09:40,310
right does not still tell you how to
you know it would be the analog of

560
00:09:40,310 --> 00:09:40,320
you know it would be the analog of
 

561
00:09:40,320 --> 00:09:41,990
you know it would be the analog of
getting a transistor

562
00:09:41,990 --> 00:09:42,000
getting a transistor
 

563
00:09:42,000 --> 00:09:44,389
getting a transistor
model right and now trying to build a

564
00:09:44,389 --> 00:09:44,399
model right and now trying to build a
 

565
00:09:44,399 --> 00:09:45,670
model right and now trying to build a
microprocessor

566
00:09:45,670 --> 00:09:45,680
microprocessor
 

567
00:09:45,680 --> 00:09:49,030
microprocessor
um and if you if you just uh observe you

568
00:09:49,030 --> 00:09:49,040
um and if you if you just uh observe you
 

569
00:09:49,040 --> 00:09:50,389
um and if you if you just uh observe you
know if you did not understand how a

570
00:09:50,389 --> 00:09:50,399
know if you did not understand how a
 

571
00:09:50,399 --> 00:09:52,070
know if you did not understand how a
microprocessor works

572
00:09:52,070 --> 00:09:52,080
microprocessor works
 

573
00:09:52,080 --> 00:09:54,710
microprocessor works
uh but you say oh i have i now can model

574
00:09:54,710 --> 00:09:54,720
uh but you say oh i have i now can model
 

575
00:09:54,720 --> 00:09:56,070
uh but you say oh i have i now can model
one transistor well

576
00:09:56,070 --> 00:09:56,080
one transistor well
 

577
00:09:56,080 --> 00:09:58,710
one transistor well
and now i will just try to interconnect

578
00:09:58,710 --> 00:09:58,720
and now i will just try to interconnect
 

579
00:09:58,720 --> 00:09:59,990
and now i will just try to interconnect
uh the transistors

580
00:09:59,990 --> 00:10:00,000
uh the transistors
 

581
00:10:00,000 --> 00:10:02,069
uh the transistors
according to whatever i could you know

582
00:10:02,069 --> 00:10:02,079
according to whatever i could you know
 

583
00:10:02,079 --> 00:10:04,630
according to whatever i could you know
guess from the experiments and try to

584
00:10:04,630 --> 00:10:04,640
guess from the experiments and try to
 

585
00:10:04,640 --> 00:10:05,590
guess from the experiments and try to
simulate it

586
00:10:05,590 --> 00:10:05,600
simulate it
 

587
00:10:05,600 --> 00:10:08,310
simulate it
um then it is very unlikely that you

588
00:10:08,310 --> 00:10:08,320
um then it is very unlikely that you
 

589
00:10:08,320 --> 00:10:08,790
um then it is very unlikely that you
will

590
00:10:08,790 --> 00:10:08,800
will
 

591
00:10:08,800 --> 00:10:11,430
will
produce a functioning microprocessor um

592
00:10:11,430 --> 00:10:11,440
produce a functioning microprocessor um
 

593
00:10:11,440 --> 00:10:12,870
produce a functioning microprocessor um
you want to you know when you want to

594
00:10:12,870 --> 00:10:12,880
you want to you know when you want to
 

595
00:10:12,880 --> 00:10:14,630
you want to you know when you want to
uh produce a functioning microprocessor

596
00:10:14,630 --> 00:10:14,640
uh produce a functioning microprocessor
 

597
00:10:14,640 --> 00:10:16,790
uh produce a functioning microprocessor
you want to understand boolean logic

598
00:10:16,790 --> 00:10:16,800
you want to understand boolean logic
 

599
00:10:16,800 --> 00:10:19,430
you want to understand boolean logic
how does how do the the gates work all

600
00:10:19,430 --> 00:10:19,440
how does how do the the gates work all
 

601
00:10:19,440 --> 00:10:20,150
how does how do the the gates work all
those things

602
00:10:20,150 --> 00:10:20,160
those things
 

603
00:10:20,160 --> 00:10:21,910
those things
and then you know understand how do

604
00:10:21,910 --> 00:10:21,920
and then you know understand how do
 

605
00:10:21,920 --> 00:10:23,190
and then you know understand how do
those gates get implemented using

606
00:10:23,190 --> 00:10:23,200
those gates get implemented using
 

607
00:10:23,200 --> 00:10:23,910
those gates get implemented using
transistors

608
00:10:23,910 --> 00:10:23,920
transistors
 

609
00:10:23,920 --> 00:10:25,670
transistors
yeah there's actually i remember this

610
00:10:25,670 --> 00:10:25,680
yeah there's actually i remember this
 

611
00:10:25,680 --> 00:10:27,030
yeah there's actually i remember this
reminds me this is a paper

612
00:10:27,030 --> 00:10:27,040
reminds me this is a paper
 

613
00:10:27,040 --> 00:10:29,750
reminds me this is a paper
maybe you're familiar with it i remember

614
00:10:29,750 --> 00:10:29,760
maybe you're familiar with it i remember
 

615
00:10:29,760 --> 00:10:31,350
maybe you're familiar with it i remember
going through in a reading group

616
00:10:31,350 --> 00:10:31,360
going through in a reading group
 

617
00:10:31,360 --> 00:10:34,790
going through in a reading group
that approaches a microprocessor from a

618
00:10:34,790 --> 00:10:34,800
that approaches a microprocessor from a
 

619
00:10:34,800 --> 00:10:36,710
that approaches a microprocessor from a
perspective a neuroscientist

620
00:10:36,710 --> 00:10:36,720
perspective a neuroscientist
 

621
00:10:36,720 --> 00:10:40,470
perspective a neuroscientist
i think it it basically it uses all the

622
00:10:40,470 --> 00:10:40,480
i think it it basically it uses all the
 

623
00:10:40,480 --> 00:10:42,389
i think it it basically it uses all the
tools that we have of neuroscience to

624
00:10:42,389 --> 00:10:42,399
tools that we have of neuroscience to
 

625
00:10:42,399 --> 00:10:44,550
tools that we have of neuroscience to
try to understand like as if we just

626
00:10:44,550 --> 00:10:44,560
try to understand like as if we just
 

627
00:10:44,560 --> 00:10:47,670
try to understand like as if we just
aliens showed up to study computers uh

628
00:10:47,670 --> 00:10:47,680
aliens showed up to study computers uh
 

629
00:10:47,680 --> 00:10:50,310
aliens showed up to study computers uh
yeah and and to see if if those tools

630
00:10:50,310 --> 00:10:50,320
yeah and and to see if if those tools
 

631
00:10:50,320 --> 00:10:51,269
yeah and and to see if if those tools
could be used to get

632
00:10:51,269 --> 00:10:51,279
could be used to get
 

633
00:10:51,279 --> 00:10:53,110
could be used to get
any kind of sense of how the

634
00:10:53,110 --> 00:10:53,120
any kind of sense of how the
 

635
00:10:53,120 --> 00:10:54,389
any kind of sense of how the
microprocessor works

636
00:10:54,389 --> 00:10:54,399
microprocessor works
 

637
00:10:54,399 --> 00:10:57,590
microprocessor works
i think the final the takeaway from

638
00:10:57,590 --> 00:10:57,600
i think the final the takeaway from
 

639
00:10:57,600 --> 00:10:59,509
i think the final the takeaway from
the at least this initials uh

640
00:10:59,509 --> 00:10:59,519
the at least this initials uh
 

641
00:10:59,519 --> 00:11:01,590
the at least this initials uh
exploration is that

642
00:11:01,590 --> 00:11:01,600
exploration is that
 

643
00:11:01,600 --> 00:11:03,110
exploration is that
we're screwed there's no way that the

644
00:11:03,110 --> 00:11:03,120
we're screwed there's no way that the
 

645
00:11:03,120 --> 00:11:04,550
we're screwed there's no way that the
tools of neuroscience would be able to

646
00:11:04,550 --> 00:11:04,560
tools of neuroscience would be able to
 

647
00:11:04,560 --> 00:11:05,430
tools of neuroscience would be able to
get us

648
00:11:05,430 --> 00:11:05,440
get us
 

649
00:11:05,440 --> 00:11:07,829
get us
to anything like not even boolean logic

650
00:11:07,829 --> 00:11:07,839
to anything like not even boolean logic
 

651
00:11:07,839 --> 00:11:09,110
to anything like not even boolean logic
i mean it's

652
00:11:09,110 --> 00:11:09,120
i mean it's
 

653
00:11:09,120 --> 00:11:12,470
i mean it's
just a any aspect

654
00:11:12,470 --> 00:11:12,480
just a any aspect
 

655
00:11:12,480 --> 00:11:15,670
just a any aspect
of the architecture of the uh

656
00:11:15,670 --> 00:11:15,680
of the architecture of the uh
 

657
00:11:15,680 --> 00:11:19,030
of the architecture of the uh
function of the processes involved

658
00:11:19,030 --> 00:11:19,040
function of the processes involved
 

659
00:11:19,040 --> 00:11:21,509
function of the processes involved
uh the the clocks the the timing all

660
00:11:21,509 --> 00:11:21,519
uh the the clocks the the timing all
 

661
00:11:21,519 --> 00:11:23,110
uh the the clocks the the timing all
that you can't figure that out from the

662
00:11:23,110 --> 00:11:23,120
that you can't figure that out from the
 

663
00:11:23,120 --> 00:11:24,710
that you can't figure that out from the

particular paper
 

669
00:11:27,839 --> 00:11:30,870
particular paper
i think it was uh called um can

670
00:11:30,870 --> 00:11:30,880
i think it was uh called um can
 

671
00:11:30,880 --> 00:11:33,110
i think it was uh called um can
uh a neuroscientist understand a

675
00:11:34,160 --> 00:11:36,230

yeah something like that following the

676
00:11:36,230 --> 00:11:36,240
yeah something like that following the
 

677
00:11:36,240 --> 00:11:37,430
yeah something like that following the
methodology

678
00:11:37,430 --> 00:11:37,440
methodology
 

679
00:11:37,440 --> 00:11:39,590
methodology
in that paper even an electrical

680
00:11:39,590 --> 00:11:39,600
in that paper even an electrical
 

681
00:11:39,600 --> 00:11:40,630
in that paper even an electrical
engineer would not understand

682
00:11:40,630 --> 00:11:40,640
engineer would not understand
 

683
00:11:40,640 --> 00:11:42,069
engineer would not understand
microprocessors so i could

684
00:11:42,069 --> 00:11:42,079
microprocessors so i could
 

685
00:11:42,079 --> 00:11:46,389
microprocessors so i could
so i could so i i don't think it is

686
00:11:46,389 --> 00:11:46,399
so i could so i i don't think it is
 

687
00:11:46,399 --> 00:11:49,190
so i could so i i don't think it is
that bad in the sense of saying um

688
00:11:49,190 --> 00:11:49,200
that bad in the sense of saying um
 

689
00:11:49,200 --> 00:11:50,550
that bad in the sense of saying um
neuroscientists do

690
00:11:50,550 --> 00:11:50,560
neuroscientists do
 

691
00:11:50,560 --> 00:11:53,829
neuroscientists do
find valuable things uh by observing the

692
00:11:53,829 --> 00:11:53,839
find valuable things uh by observing the
 

693
00:11:53,839 --> 00:11:54,629
find valuable things uh by observing the
brain

694
00:11:54,629 --> 00:11:54,639
brain
 

695
00:11:54,639 --> 00:11:58,310
brain
they they do find good insights um

696
00:11:58,310 --> 00:11:58,320
they they do find good insights um
 

697
00:11:58,320 --> 00:12:01,590
they they do find good insights um
but those insight cannot be put together

698
00:12:01,590 --> 00:12:01,600
but those insight cannot be put together
 

699
00:12:01,600 --> 00:12:04,629
but those insight cannot be put together
just as a simulation you have to you

700
00:12:04,629 --> 00:12:04,639
just as a simulation you have to you
 

701
00:12:04,639 --> 00:12:05,990
just as a simulation you have to you
have to investigate

702
00:12:05,990 --> 00:12:06,000
have to investigate
 

703
00:12:06,000 --> 00:12:08,069
have to investigate
what are the computational underpinnings

704
00:12:08,069 --> 00:12:08,079
what are the computational underpinnings
 

705
00:12:08,079 --> 00:12:09,110
what are the computational underpinnings
pinnings of

706
00:12:09,110 --> 00:12:09,120
pinnings of
 

707
00:12:09,120 --> 00:12:12,230
pinnings of
those findings how do all of them

708
00:12:12,230 --> 00:12:12,240
those findings how do all of them
 

709
00:12:12,240 --> 00:12:14,710
those findings how do all of them
fit together from an information

710
00:12:14,710 --> 00:12:14,720
fit together from an information
 

711
00:12:14,720 --> 00:12:15,350
fit together from an information

00:12:18,480 --> 00:12:20,710
somebody has to
uh painstakingly put those things

00:12:20,710 --> 00:12:20,720
uh painstakingly put those things
 

719
00:12:20,720 --> 00:12:22,790
uh painstakingly put those things
together and build hypothesis um

so i don't want to this all of

722
00:12:24,629 --> 00:12:24,639
so i don't want to this all of

so i don't want to this all of
neuroscience is saying oh they are not

724
00:12:26,150 --> 00:12:26,160
neuroscience is saying oh they are not
 

725
00:12:26,160 --> 00:12:27,190
neuroscience is saying oh they are not
finding anything no that

726
00:12:27,190 --> 00:12:27,200
finding anything no that
 

727
00:12:27,200 --> 00:12:28,949
finding anything no that
you know that that paper almost went to

728
00:12:28,949 --> 00:12:28,959
you know that that paper almost went to
 

729
00:12:28,959 --> 00:12:30,870
you know that that paper almost went to
that level of uh uh

730
00:12:30,870 --> 00:12:30,880
that level of uh uh
 

731
00:12:30,880 --> 00:12:32,790
that level of uh uh
neuroscientists will never understand uh

732
00:12:32,790 --> 00:12:32,800
neuroscientists will never understand uh
 

733
00:12:32,800 --> 00:12:34,949
neuroscientists will never understand uh
no that that's not true i think they do

734
00:12:34,949 --> 00:12:34,959
no that that's not true i think they do
 

735
00:12:34,959 --> 00:12:36,629
no that that's not true i think they do
find lots of useful things

736
00:12:36,629 --> 00:12:36,639
find lots of useful things
 

737
00:12:36,639 --> 00:12:38,470
find lots of useful things
but it has to be put together in a

738
00:12:38,470 --> 00:12:38,480
but it has to be put together in a
 

739
00:12:38,480 --> 00:12:39,829
but it has to be put together in a
computational framework

740
00:12:39,829 --> 00:12:39,839
computational framework
 

741
00:12:39,839 --> 00:12:43,030
computational framework
yeah i mean but you know just the ai

742
00:12:43,030 --> 00:12:43,040
yeah i mean but you know just the ai
 

743
00:12:43,040 --> 00:12:44,470
yeah i mean but you know just the ai

it's like i remember humans thought they
 

755
00:12:55,120 --> 00:12:55,910
it's like i remember humans thought they
understood

756
00:12:55,910 --> 00:12:55,920
understood
 

757
00:12:55,920 --> 00:12:57,030
understood
something about the brain they're

758
00:12:57,030 --> 00:12:57,040
something about the brain they're
 

759
00:12:57,040 --> 00:12:59,030
something about the brain they're
totally clueless there's a sense about

760
00:12:59,030 --> 00:12:59,040
totally clueless there's a sense about
 

761
00:12:59,040 --> 00:13:01,030
totally clueless there's a sense about
neuroscience that we may be in the very

762
00:13:01,030 --> 00:13:01,040
neuroscience that we may be in the very
 

763
00:13:01,040 --> 00:13:03,430
neuroscience that we may be in the very
very early days of understanding

00:13:03,430 --> 00:13:03,440
very early days of understanding
 

765
00:13:03,440 --> 00:13:06,150
very early days of understanding
uh the brain but i mean that's one

766
00:13:06,150 --> 00:13:06,160
uh the brain but i mean that's one
 

767
00:13:06,160 --> 00:13:07,030
uh the brain but i mean that's one
perspective

768
00:13:07,030 --> 00:13:07,040
perspective
 

769
00:13:07,040 --> 00:13:10,150
perspective
in your perspective

770
00:13:10,150 --> 00:13:10,160
in your perspective
 

771
00:13:10,160 --> 00:13:14,389
in your perspective
how far are we into understanding

772
00:13:14,389 --> 00:13:14,399
how far are we into understanding
 

773
00:13:14,399 --> 00:13:18,069
how far are we into understanding
uh any aspect of the brain

774
00:13:18,069 --> 00:13:18,079
uh any aspect of the brain
 

775
00:13:18,079 --> 00:13:19,990
uh any aspect of the brain
so the the the dynamics of the

776
00:13:19,990 --> 00:13:20,000
so the the the dynamics of the
 

777
00:13:20,000 --> 00:13:21,910
so the the the dynamics of the
individual neuron communication

778
00:13:21,910 --> 00:13:21,920
individual neuron communication
 

779
00:13:21,920 --> 00:13:26,150
individual neuron communication
to the how when they in in a collective

780
00:13:26,150 --> 00:13:26,160
to the how when they in in a collective
 

781
00:13:26,160 --> 00:13:28,389
to the how when they in in a collective
sense how they're able to store

782
00:13:28,389 --> 00:13:28,399
sense how they're able to store
 

783
00:13:28,399 --> 00:13:30,790
sense how they're able to store
information transfer information

784
00:13:30,790 --> 00:13:30,800
information transfer information
 

785
00:13:30,800 --> 00:13:32,550
information transfer information
how the intelligence then emerges all

786
00:13:32,550 --> 00:13:32,560
how the intelligence then emerges all
 

787
00:13:32,560 --> 00:13:34,310
how the intelligence then emerges all
that kind of stuff where are we on that

788
00:13:34,310 --> 00:13:34,320
that kind of stuff where are we on that
 

789
00:13:34,320 --> 00:13:35,030
that kind of stuff where are we on that
timeline

790
00:13:35,030 --> 00:13:35,040
timeline
 

791
00:13:35,040 --> 00:13:37,670
timeline
yeah so you know timelines are very very

792
00:13:37,670 --> 00:13:37,680
yeah so you know timelines are very very
 

793
00:13:37,680 --> 00:13:38,470
yeah so you know timelines are very very
hard to predict

794
00:13:38,470 --> 00:13:38,480
hard to predict
 

795
00:13:38,480 --> 00:13:41,030
hard to predict
and you can of course be wrong uh and it

796
00:13:41,030 --> 00:13:41,040
and you can of course be wrong uh and it
 

797
00:13:41,040 --> 00:13:42,150
and you can of course be wrong uh and it
can be wrong in

798
00:13:42,150 --> 00:13:42,160
can be wrong in
 

799
00:13:42,160 --> 00:13:45,269
can be wrong in
on either side uh you know we know that

800
00:13:45,269 --> 00:13:45,279
on either side uh you know we know that
 

801
00:13:45,279 --> 00:13:48,069
on either side uh you know we know that
uh now when we look back uh the first

802
00:13:48,069 --> 00:13:48,079
uh now when we look back uh the first
 

803
00:13:48,079 --> 00:13:48,870
uh now when we look back uh the first
flight

804
00:13:48,870 --> 00:13:48,880
flight
 

805
00:13:48,880 --> 00:13:52,870
flight
was in 1903. uh in 1900

806
00:13:52,870 --> 00:13:52,880
was in 1903. uh in 1900
 

807
00:13:52,880 --> 00:13:55,590
was in 1903. uh in 1900
there was a new york times article on

808
00:13:55,590 --> 00:13:55,600
there was a new york times article on
 

809
00:13:55,600 --> 00:13:56,870
there was a new york times article on
flying machines that

810
00:13:56,870 --> 00:13:56,880
flying machines that
 

811
00:13:56,880 --> 00:14:00,629
flying machines that
do not fly and and you know humans might

812
00:14:00,629 --> 00:14:00,639
do not fly and and you know humans might
 

813
00:14:00,639 --> 00:14:02,550
do not fly and and you know humans might
not fly for another hundred years

814
00:14:02,550 --> 00:14:02,560
not fly for another hundred years
 

815
00:14:02,560 --> 00:14:04,949
not fly for another hundred years
that was what that article uh stated and

816
00:14:04,949 --> 00:14:04,959
that was what that article uh stated and
 

817
00:14:04,959 --> 00:14:06,069
that was what that article uh stated and
uh so

818
00:14:06,069 --> 00:14:06,079
uh so
 

819
00:14:06,079 --> 00:14:08,069
uh so
but no they they flew three years after

820
00:14:08,069 --> 00:14:08,079
but no they they flew three years after
 

821
00:14:08,079 --> 00:14:10,069
but no they they flew three years after
that so it is you know it's very hard to

822
00:14:10,069 --> 00:14:10,079
that so it is you know it's very hard to
 

823
00:14:10,079 --> 00:14:13,189
that so it is you know it's very hard to
um so well and on that point one of the

824
00:14:13,189 --> 00:14:13,199
um so well and on that point one of the
 

825
00:14:13,199 --> 00:14:14,629
um so well and on that point one of the
wright brothers

826
00:14:14,629 --> 00:14:14,639
wright brothers
 

827
00:14:14,639 --> 00:14:17,990
wright brothers
uh i think two years before

828
00:14:17,990 --> 00:14:18,000
uh i think two years before
 

829
00:14:18,000 --> 00:14:21,670
uh i think two years before
uh said that uh like he said like some

830
00:14:21,670 --> 00:14:21,680
uh said that uh like he said like some
 

831
00:14:21,680 --> 00:14:22,949
uh said that uh like he said like some
number like 50 years

832
00:14:22,949 --> 00:14:22,959
number like 50 years
 

833
00:14:22,959 --> 00:14:26,150
number like 50 years
he he has become convinced that it's

834
00:14:26,150 --> 00:14:26,160
he he has become convinced that it's
 

835
00:14:26,160 --> 00:14:29,509
he he has become convinced that it's
it's uh it's impossible

836
00:14:29,509 --> 00:14:29,519
it's uh it's impossible
 

837
00:14:29,519 --> 00:14:31,189
it's uh it's impossible
even during their experimentation yeah

838
00:14:31,189 --> 00:14:31,199
even during their experimentation yeah
 

839
00:14:31,199 --> 00:14:33,189
even during their experimentation yeah
yeah yeah i mean that's a tribute to

840
00:14:33,189 --> 00:14:33,199
yeah yeah i mean that's a tribute to
 

841
00:14:33,199 --> 00:14:33,990
yeah yeah i mean that's a tribute to
when

842
00:14:33,990 --> 00:14:34,000
when
 

843
00:14:34,000 --> 00:14:35,910
when
that's like the entrepreneurial battle

844
00:14:35,910 --> 00:14:35,920
that's like the entrepreneurial battle
 

845
00:14:35,920 --> 00:14:37,269
that's like the entrepreneurial battle
of like depression of

846
00:14:37,269 --> 00:14:37,279
of like depression of
 

847
00:14:37,279 --> 00:14:39,590
of like depression of
going through just like thinking this is

848
00:14:39,590 --> 00:14:39,600
going through just like thinking this is
 

849
00:14:39,600 --> 00:14:40,389
going through just like thinking this is
impossible

850
00:14:40,389 --> 00:14:40,399
impossible
 

851
00:14:40,399 --> 00:14:42,629
impossible
right but there yeah there's something

852
00:14:42,629 --> 00:14:42,639
right but there yeah there's something
 

853
00:14:42,639 --> 00:14:44,310
right but there yeah there's something
even the person that's in it

854
00:14:44,310 --> 00:14:44,320
even the person that's in it
 

855
00:14:44,320 --> 00:14:47,350
even the person that's in it
is not able to see uh estimate correctly

856
00:14:47,350 --> 00:14:47,360
is not able to see uh estimate correctly
 

857
00:14:47,360 --> 00:14:49,750
is not able to see uh estimate correctly
exactly but i can i can tell from the

858
00:14:49,750 --> 00:14:49,760
exactly but i can i can tell from the
 

859
00:14:49,760 --> 00:14:51,189
exactly but i can i can tell from the
point of you know objectively what are

860
00:14:51,189 --> 00:14:51,199
point of you know objectively what are
 

861
00:14:51,199 --> 00:14:52,550
point of you know objectively what are
the things that we

862
00:14:52,550 --> 00:14:52,560
the things that we
 

863
00:14:52,560 --> 00:14:54,710
the things that we
know about the brain and how that can be

864
00:14:54,710 --> 00:14:54,720
know about the brain and how that can be
 

865
00:14:54,720 --> 00:14:56,150
know about the brain and how that can be
used to build

866
00:14:56,150 --> 00:14:56,160
used to build
 

867
00:14:56,160 --> 00:14:58,550
used to build
ai models which can then go back and

868
00:14:58,550 --> 00:14:58,560
ai models which can then go back and
 

869
00:14:58,560 --> 00:14:59,269
ai models which can then go back and
inform

870
00:14:59,269 --> 00:14:59,279
inform
 

871
00:14:59,279 --> 00:15:01,829
inform
how the brain works so my way of

872
00:15:01,829 --> 00:15:01,839
how the brain works so my way of
 

873
00:15:01,839 --> 00:15:03,189
how the brain works so my way of
understanding the brain would be to

874
00:15:03,189 --> 00:15:03,199
understanding the brain would be to
 

875
00:15:03,199 --> 00:15:04,069
understanding the brain would be to
basically say

876
00:15:04,069 --> 00:15:04,079
basically say
 

877
00:15:04,079 --> 00:15:05,750
basically say
look at the insights neuroscientists

878
00:15:05,750 --> 00:15:05,760
look at the insights neuroscientists
 

879
00:15:05,760 --> 00:15:07,110
look at the insights neuroscientists
have found

880
00:15:07,110 --> 00:15:07,120
have found
 

881
00:15:07,120 --> 00:15:10,550
have found
understand that from a computational

882
00:15:10,550 --> 00:15:10,560
understand that from a computational
 

883
00:15:10,560 --> 00:15:13,509
understand that from a computational
angle information processing angle build

884
00:15:13,509 --> 00:15:13,519
angle information processing angle build
 

885
00:15:13,519 --> 00:15:15,269
angle information processing angle build
models using that

886
00:15:15,269 --> 00:15:15,279
models using that
 

887
00:15:15,279 --> 00:15:18,069
models using that
and then building the that model which

888
00:15:18,069 --> 00:15:18,079
and then building the that model which
 

889
00:15:18,079 --> 00:15:18,550
and then building the that model which
which

890
00:15:18,550 --> 00:15:18,560
which
 

891
00:15:18,560 --> 00:15:20,389
which
functions which is a functional model

892
00:15:20,389 --> 00:15:20,399
functions which is a functional model
 

893
00:15:20,399 --> 00:15:22,310
functions which is a functional model
which is which is doing the task

894
00:15:22,310 --> 00:15:22,320
which is which is doing the task
 

895
00:15:22,320 --> 00:15:24,069
which is which is doing the task
that we want the model to do it is not

896
00:15:24,069 --> 00:15:24,079
that we want the model to do it is not
 

897
00:15:24,079 --> 00:15:26,389
that we want the model to do it is not
just trying to model a phenomena in the

898
00:15:26,389 --> 00:15:26,399
just trying to model a phenomena in the
 

899
00:15:26,399 --> 00:15:27,910
just trying to model a phenomena in the
brain it is it is trying to

900
00:15:27,910 --> 00:15:27,920
brain it is it is trying to
 

901
00:15:27,920 --> 00:15:29,670
brain it is it is trying to
do what the brain is trying to do on on

902
00:15:29,670 --> 00:15:29,680
do what the brain is trying to do on on
 

903
00:15:29,680 --> 00:15:31,030
do what the brain is trying to do on on
the whole

904
00:15:31,030 --> 00:15:31,040
the whole
 

905
00:15:31,040 --> 00:15:33,430
the whole
functional level and building that model

906
00:15:33,430 --> 00:15:33,440
functional level and building that model
 

907
00:15:33,440 --> 00:15:35,030
functional level and building that model
will help you

908
00:15:35,030 --> 00:15:35,040
will help you
 

909
00:15:35,040 --> 00:15:37,350
will help you
fill in the missing pieces that you know

910
00:15:37,350 --> 00:15:37,360
fill in the missing pieces that you know
 

911
00:15:37,360 --> 00:15:39,269
fill in the missing pieces that you know
biology just gives you the hints

912
00:15:39,269 --> 00:15:39,279
biology just gives you the hints
 

913
00:15:39,279 --> 00:15:42,069
biology just gives you the hints
and building the model you know fills in

914
00:15:42,069 --> 00:15:42,079
and building the model you know fills in
 

915
00:15:42,079 --> 00:15:42,310
and building the model you know fills in
the

916
00:15:42,310 --> 00:15:42,320
the
 

917
00:15:42,320 --> 00:15:44,710
the
rest of the the pieces of the puzzle and

918
00:15:44,710 --> 00:15:44,720
rest of the the pieces of the puzzle and
 

919
00:15:44,720 --> 00:15:46,069
rest of the the pieces of the puzzle and
then you can go and

920
00:15:46,069 --> 00:15:46,079
then you can go and
 

921
00:15:46,079 --> 00:15:47,990
then you can go and
connect that back to biology and say

922
00:15:47,990 --> 00:15:48,000
connect that back to biology and say
 

923
00:15:48,000 --> 00:15:50,310
connect that back to biology and say
okay now it makes sense that this part

924
00:15:50,310 --> 00:15:50,320
okay now it makes sense that this part
 

925
00:15:50,320 --> 00:15:51,110
okay now it makes sense that this part
of

926
00:15:51,110 --> 00:15:51,120
of
 

927
00:15:51,120 --> 00:15:54,150
of
the brain is uh doing this or

928
00:15:54,150 --> 00:15:54,160
the brain is uh doing this or
 

929
00:15:54,160 --> 00:15:56,470
the brain is uh doing this or
this layer in the cortical circuit is

930
00:15:56,470 --> 00:15:56,480
this layer in the cortical circuit is
 

931
00:15:56,480 --> 00:15:57,509
this layer in the cortical circuit is
doing this uh

932
00:15:57,509 --> 00:15:57,519
doing this uh
 

933
00:15:57,519 --> 00:15:59,910
doing this uh
and and and then continue this

934
00:15:59,910 --> 00:15:59,920
and and and then continue this
 

935
00:15:59,920 --> 00:16:00,949
and and and then continue this
iteratively

936
00:16:00,949 --> 00:16:00,959
iteratively
 

937
00:16:00,959 --> 00:16:03,430
iteratively
because now that will inform new

938
00:16:03,430 --> 00:16:03,440
because now that will inform new
 

939
00:16:03,440 --> 00:16:04,870
because now that will inform new
experiments in neuroscience

940
00:16:04,870 --> 00:16:04,880
experiments in neuroscience
 

941
00:16:04,880 --> 00:16:06,550
experiments in neuroscience
and of course you know building the

942
00:16:06,550 --> 00:16:06,560
and of course you know building the
 

943
00:16:06,560 --> 00:16:08,310
and of course you know building the
model and verifying that in the real

944
00:16:08,310 --> 00:16:08,320
model and verifying that in the real
 

945
00:16:08,320 --> 00:16:08,790
model and verifying that in the real
world

946
00:16:08,790 --> 00:16:08,800
world
 

947
00:16:08,800 --> 00:16:11,590
world
will you will also tell you more about

948
00:16:11,590 --> 00:16:11,600
will you will also tell you more about
 

949
00:16:11,600 --> 00:16:13,110
will you will also tell you more about
does the model actually work

950
00:16:13,110 --> 00:16:13,120
does the model actually work
 

951
00:16:13,120 --> 00:16:16,230
does the model actually work
uh and you can refine the model find

952
00:16:16,230 --> 00:16:16,240
uh and you can refine the model find
 

953
00:16:16,240 --> 00:16:17,430
uh and you can refine the model find
better ways of putting these

954
00:16:17,430 --> 00:16:17,440
better ways of putting these
 

955
00:16:17,440 --> 00:16:19,590
better ways of putting these
neuroscience insights together

956
00:16:19,590 --> 00:16:19,600
neuroscience insights together
 

957
00:16:19,600 --> 00:16:22,150
neuroscience insights together
so so i would say it is it is you know

958
00:16:22,150 --> 00:16:22,160
so so i would say it is it is you know
 

959
00:16:22,160 --> 00:16:22,790
so so i would say it is it is you know
it

960
00:16:22,790 --> 00:16:22,800
it
 

961
00:16:22,800 --> 00:16:25,829
it
so neuroscientists alone just from

962
00:16:25,829 --> 00:16:25,839
so neuroscientists alone just from
 

963
00:16:25,839 --> 00:16:27,030
so neuroscientists alone just from
experimentation

964
00:16:27,030 --> 00:16:27,040
experimentation
 

965
00:16:27,040 --> 00:16:28,870
experimentation
will not be able to build a model of the

966
00:16:28,870 --> 00:16:28,880
will not be able to build a model of the
 

967
00:16:28,880 --> 00:16:31,110
will not be able to build a model of the
of the brain uh or a functional model of

968
00:16:31,110 --> 00:16:31,120
of the brain uh or a functional model of
 

969
00:16:31,120 --> 00:16:31,829
of the brain uh or a functional model of
the brain

970
00:16:31,829 --> 00:16:31,839
the brain
 

971
00:16:31,839 --> 00:16:34,949
the brain
so we you know there there's uh lots of

972
00:16:34,949 --> 00:16:34,959
so we you know there there's uh lots of
 

973
00:16:34,959 --> 00:16:36,150
so we you know there there's uh lots of
efforts which are very impressive

974
00:16:36,150 --> 00:16:36,160
efforts which are very impressive
 

975
00:16:36,160 --> 00:16:37,030
efforts which are very impressive
efforts in

976
00:16:37,030 --> 00:16:37,040
efforts in
 

977
00:16:37,040 --> 00:16:39,509
efforts in
collecting more and more connectivity

978
00:16:39,509 --> 00:16:39,519
collecting more and more connectivity
 

979
00:16:39,519 --> 00:16:40,310
collecting more and more connectivity
data

980
00:16:40,310 --> 00:16:40,320
data
 

981
00:16:40,320 --> 00:16:42,310
data
from the brain yeah you know how how are

982
00:16:42,310 --> 00:16:42,320
from the brain yeah you know how how are
 

983
00:16:42,320 --> 00:16:44,710
from the brain yeah you know how how are
the micro circuits of the brain

984
00:16:44,710 --> 00:16:44,720
the micro circuits of the brain
 

985
00:16:44,720 --> 00:16:45,910
the micro circuits of the brain
connected with each other those are

986
00:16:45,910 --> 00:16:45,920
connected with each other those are
 

987
00:16:45,920 --> 00:16:48,470
connected with each other those are
beautiful by the way those are beautiful

988
00:16:48,470 --> 00:16:48,480
beautiful by the way those are beautiful
 

989
00:16:48,480 --> 00:16:51,590
beautiful by the way those are beautiful
uh and at the same time those

990
00:16:51,590 --> 00:16:51,600
uh and at the same time those
 

991
00:16:51,600 --> 00:16:54,870
uh and at the same time those
those do not itself um by themselves

992
00:16:54,870 --> 00:16:54,880
those do not itself um by themselves
 

993
00:16:54,880 --> 00:16:57,030
those do not itself um by themselves
convey the story of how does it work

994
00:16:57,030 --> 00:16:57,040
convey the story of how does it work
 

995
00:16:57,040 --> 00:16:58,230
convey the story of how does it work
yeah uh and

996
00:16:58,230 --> 00:16:58,240
yeah uh and
 

997
00:16:58,240 --> 00:17:00,470
yeah uh and
and somebody has to understand okay why

998
00:17:00,470 --> 00:17:00,480
and somebody has to understand okay why
 

999
00:17:00,480 --> 00:17:01,749
and somebody has to understand okay why
are they connected like that

1000
00:17:01,749 --> 00:17:01,759
are they connected like that
 

1001
00:17:01,759 --> 00:17:04,549
are they connected like that
and what what are those things doing uh

1002
00:17:04,549 --> 00:17:04,559
and what what are those things doing uh
 

1003
00:17:04,559 --> 00:17:05,270
and what what are those things doing uh
and

1004
00:17:05,270 --> 00:17:05,280
and
 

1005
00:17:05,280 --> 00:17:08,069
and
and we do that by building models in ai

1006
00:17:08,069 --> 00:17:08,079
and we do that by building models in ai
 

1007
00:17:08,079 --> 00:17:09,909
and we do that by building models in ai

00:17:18,720 --> 00:17:20,630
endeavor which by the way i should say
you're you're both the neuroscientists

1018
00:17:20,630 --> 00:17:20,640
you're you're both the neuroscientists
 

1019
00:17:20,640 --> 00:17:20,949
you're you're both the neuroscientists
and

1020
00:17:20,949 --> 00:17:20,959
and
 

1021
00:17:20,959 --> 00:17:24,309
and
and ai person i guess the dream is to

1022
00:17:24,309 --> 00:17:24,319
and ai person i guess the dream is to
 

1023
00:17:24,319 --> 00:17:26,150
and ai person i guess the dream is to
both understand the brain and to build

1024
00:17:26,150 --> 00:17:26,160
both understand the brain and to build
 

1025
00:17:26,160 --> 00:17:27,429
both understand the brain and to build
agi systems

1026
00:17:27,429 --> 00:17:27,439

so you're it's like an engineer's

1028
00:17:31,029 --> 00:17:31,039
so you're it's like an engineer's
 

1029
00:17:31,039 --> 00:17:33,029
so you're it's like an engineer's
perspective of trying to understand the

1030
00:17:33,029 --> 00:17:33,039
perspective of trying to understand the
 

1031
00:17:33,039 --> 00:17:35,750
perspective of trying to understand the
brain so what aspects of the brain

1032
00:17:35,750 --> 00:17:35,760
brain so what aspects of the brain
 

1033
00:17:35,760 --> 00:17:37,669
brain so what aspects of the brain
uh functioning speaking like you said

1034
00:17:37,669 --> 00:17:37,679
uh functioning speaking like you said
 

1035
00:17:37,679 --> 00:17:38,789
uh functioning speaking like you said
you find interesting

1036
00:17:38,789 --> 00:17:38,799
you find interesting
 

1037
00:17:38,799 --> 00:17:40,630
you find interesting
yeah quite a lot of things all right so

1038
00:17:40,630 --> 00:17:40,640
yeah quite a lot of things all right so
 

1039
00:17:40,640 --> 00:17:41,830
yeah quite a lot of things all right so
one is

1040
00:17:41,830 --> 00:17:41,840
one is
 

1041
00:17:41,840 --> 00:17:44,390
one is
um you know if you look at the visual

1042
00:17:44,390 --> 00:17:44,400
um you know if you look at the visual
 

1043
00:17:44,400 --> 00:17:45,270
um you know if you look at the visual
cortex

1044
00:17:45,270 --> 00:17:45,280
cortex
 

1045
00:17:45,280 --> 00:17:48,950
cortex
um uh and and you know the visual cortex

1046
00:17:48,950 --> 00:17:48,960
um uh and and you know the visual cortex
 

1047
00:17:48,960 --> 00:17:49,270
um uh and and you know the visual cortex
is

1048
00:17:49,270 --> 00:17:49,280
is
 

1049
00:17:49,280 --> 00:17:51,190
is
is a large part of the brain uh i forget

1050
00:17:51,190 --> 00:17:51,200
is a large part of the brain uh i forget
 

1051
00:17:51,200 --> 00:17:53,029
is a large part of the brain uh i forget
this exact fraction but it is

1052
00:17:53,029 --> 00:17:53,039
this exact fraction but it is
 

1053
00:17:53,039 --> 00:17:55,270
this exact fraction but it is
it's a it's a huge part of our brain

1054
00:17:55,270 --> 00:17:55,280
it's a it's a huge part of our brain
 

1055
00:17:55,280 --> 00:17:56,390
it's a it's a huge part of our brain
area is uh

1056
00:17:56,390 --> 00:17:56,400
area is uh
 

1057
00:17:56,400 --> 00:17:59,270
area is uh
occupied by just just vision um so

1058
00:17:59,270 --> 00:17:59,280
occupied by just just vision um so
 

1059
00:17:59,280 --> 00:18:00,070
occupied by just just vision um so
vision

1060
00:18:00,070 --> 00:18:00,080

visual cortex is not just a feed-forward

1062
00:18:03,110 --> 00:18:03,120
visual cortex is not just a feed-forward
 

1063
00:18:03,120 --> 00:18:04,549
visual cortex is not just a feed-forward
cascade of neurons

1064
00:18:04,549 --> 00:18:04,559
cascade of neurons
 

1065
00:18:04,559 --> 00:18:07,029
cascade of neurons
um uh there are a lot more feedback

1066
00:18:07,029 --> 00:18:07,039
um uh there are a lot more feedback
 

1067
00:18:07,039 --> 00:18:08,230
um uh there are a lot more feedback
connections in the brain

1068
00:18:08,230 --> 00:18:08,240
connections in the brain
 

1069
00:18:08,240 --> 00:18:09,990
connections in the brain
compared to the feed-forward connections

1070
00:18:09,990 --> 00:18:10,000
compared to the feed-forward connections
 

1071
00:18:10,000 --> 00:18:11,350
compared to the feed-forward connections
and and

1072
00:18:11,350 --> 00:18:11,360
and and
 

1073
00:18:11,360 --> 00:18:14,230
and and
it is surprising to the level of detail

1074
00:18:14,230 --> 00:18:14,240
it is surprising to the level of detail
 

1075
00:18:14,240 --> 00:18:15,909
it is surprising to the level of detail
neuroscientists have actually studied

1077
00:18:15,919 --> 00:18:16,310
neuroscientists have actually studied
this

1078
00:18:16,310 --> 00:18:16,320
this
 

1079
00:18:16,320 --> 00:18:17,669
this
if you if you go into neuroscience

1080
00:18:17,669 --> 00:18:17,679
if you if you go into neuroscience
 

1081
00:18:17,679 --> 00:18:19,990
if you if you go into neuroscience
literature and poke around and ask you

1082
00:18:19,990 --> 00:18:20,000
literature and poke around and ask you
 

1083
00:18:20,000 --> 00:18:20,390
literature and poke around and ask you
know

1084
00:18:20,390 --> 00:18:20,400
know
 

1085
00:18:20,400 --> 00:18:22,549
know
have they studied what will be the

1086
00:18:22,549 --> 00:18:22,559
have they studied what will be the
 

1087
00:18:22,559 --> 00:18:24,710
have they studied what will be the
effect of poking a neuron

1088
00:18:24,710 --> 00:18:24,720
effect of poking a neuron
 

1089
00:18:24,720 --> 00:18:28,070
effect of poking a neuron
in level i.t uh in

1090
00:18:28,070 --> 00:18:28,080
in level i.t uh in
 

1091
00:18:28,080 --> 00:18:31,590
in level i.t uh in
level v one and uh um have they studied

1092
00:18:31,590 --> 00:18:31,600
level v one and uh um have they studied
 

1093
00:18:31,600 --> 00:18:32,390
level v one and uh um have they studied
that uh

1094
00:18:32,390 --> 00:18:32,400
that uh
 

1095
00:18:32,400 --> 00:18:34,390
that uh
and you will say yes they have studied

1096
00:18:34,390 --> 00:18:34,400
and you will say yes they have studied
 

1097
00:18:34,400 --> 00:18:35,510
and you will say yes they have studied
that so

1098
00:18:35,510 --> 00:18:35,520
that so
 

1099
00:18:35,520 --> 00:18:38,870
that so
every every possible combination i mean

1100
00:18:38,870 --> 00:18:38,880
every every possible combination i mean
 

1101
00:18:38,880 --> 00:18:40,710
every every possible combination i mean
it's it's a it's not a random

1102
00:18:40,710 --> 00:18:40,720
it's it's a it's not a random
 

1103
00:18:40,720 --> 00:18:42,710
it's it's a it's not a random
exploration at all it's very hypothesis

1104
00:18:42,710 --> 00:18:42,720
exploration at all it's very hypothesis
 

1105
00:18:42,720 --> 00:18:43,990
exploration at all it's very hypothesis
driven right

1106
00:18:43,990 --> 00:18:44,000
driven right
 

1107
00:18:44,000 --> 00:18:45,750
driven right
they are very uh experimental

1108
00:18:45,750 --> 00:18:45,760
they are very uh experimental
 

1109
00:18:45,760 --> 00:18:47,590
they are very uh experimental
neuroscientists are very very systematic

1110
00:18:47,590 --> 00:18:47,600
neuroscientists are very very systematic
 

1111
00:18:47,600 --> 00:18:49,590
neuroscientists are very very systematic
in how they probe the brain uh because

1112
00:18:49,590 --> 00:18:49,600
in how they probe the brain uh because
 

1113
00:18:49,600 --> 00:18:50,789
in how they probe the brain uh because
experiments are

1114
00:18:50,789 --> 00:18:50,799
experiments are
 

1115
00:18:50,799 --> 00:18:52,630
experiments are
very costly to conduct they take a lot

1116
00:18:52,630 --> 00:18:52,640
very costly to conduct they take a lot
 

1117
00:18:52,640 --> 00:18:53,909
very costly to conduct they take a lot
of preparation they

1118
00:18:53,909 --> 00:18:53,919
of preparation they
 

1119
00:18:53,919 --> 00:18:55,909
of preparation they
they need a lot of control so they they

1120
00:18:55,909 --> 00:18:55,919
they need a lot of control so they they
 

1121
00:18:55,919 --> 00:18:57,750
they need a lot of control so they they
are very hypothesis driven in how they

1122
00:18:57,750 --> 00:18:57,760
are very hypothesis driven in how they
 

1123
00:18:57,760 --> 00:18:58,470
are very hypothesis driven in how they
probe the brain

1124
00:18:58,470 --> 00:18:58,480
probe the brain
 

1125
00:18:58,480 --> 00:19:01,029
probe the brain
and um often what i find is that when we

1126
00:19:01,029 --> 00:19:01,039
and um often what i find is that when we
 

1127
00:19:01,039 --> 00:19:02,150
and um often what i find is that when we
have a question

1128
00:19:02,150 --> 00:19:02,160
have a question
 

1129
00:19:02,160 --> 00:19:05,510
have a question
in um in ai uh about

1130
00:19:05,510 --> 00:19:05,520
in um in ai uh about
 

1131
00:19:05,520 --> 00:19:08,230
in um in ai uh about
have has anybody probably probed how

1132
00:19:08,230 --> 00:19:08,240
have has anybody probably probed how
 

1133
00:19:08,240 --> 00:19:10,470
have has anybody probably probed how
lateral connections in the brain works

1134
00:19:10,470 --> 00:19:10,480
lateral connections in the brain works
 

1135
00:19:10,480 --> 00:19:11,909
lateral connections in the brain works
and when you go and read the literature

1136
00:19:11,909 --> 00:19:11,919
and when you go and read the literature
 

1137
00:19:11,919 --> 00:19:13,430
and when you go and read the literature
yes people have probed it and people

1138
00:19:13,430 --> 00:19:13,440
yes people have probed it and people
 

1139
00:19:13,440 --> 00:19:15,190
yes people have probed it and people
have probed it very systematically

1140
00:19:15,190 --> 00:19:15,200
have probed it very systematically
 

1141
00:19:15,200 --> 00:19:18,630
have probed it very systematically
and and they have hypothesis about how

1142
00:19:18,630 --> 00:19:18,640
and and they have hypothesis about how
 

1143
00:19:18,640 --> 00:19:21,270
and and they have hypothesis about how
those lateral connections are supposedly

1144
00:19:21,270 --> 00:19:21,280
those lateral connections are supposedly
 

1145
00:19:21,280 --> 00:19:22,230
those lateral connections are supposedly
contributing

1146
00:19:22,230 --> 00:19:22,240
contributing
 

1147
00:19:22,240 --> 00:19:25,190
contributing
to visual processing uh but of course

1148
00:19:25,190 --> 00:19:25,200
to visual processing uh but of course
 

1149
00:19:25,200 --> 00:19:26,150
to visual processing uh but of course
they haven't built

1150
00:19:26,150 --> 00:19:26,160
they haven't built
 

1151
00:19:26,160 --> 00:19:28,710
they haven't built
very very functional detail models of it

1152
00:19:28,710 --> 00:19:28,720
very very functional detail models of it
 

1153
00:19:28,720 --> 00:19:29,510
very very functional detail models of it
by the way how do

1154
00:19:29,510 --> 00:19:29,520
by the way how do
 

1155
00:19:29,520 --> 00:19:31,350
by the way how do
you know studies start to interrupt that

1156
00:19:31,350 --> 00:19:31,360
you know studies start to interrupt that
 

1157
00:19:31,360 --> 00:19:33,669
you know studies start to interrupt that
do they do they stimulate like a neuron

1158
00:19:33,669 --> 00:19:33,679
do they do they stimulate like a neuron
 

1159
00:19:33,679 --> 00:19:35,590
do they do they stimulate like a neuron
in one particular area of the visual

1160
00:19:35,590 --> 00:19:35,600
in one particular area of the visual
 

1161
00:19:35,600 --> 00:19:36,470
in one particular area of the visual
cortex

1162
00:19:36,470 --> 00:19:36,480
cortex
 

1163
00:19:36,480 --> 00:19:37,909
cortex
and then see how the travel of the

1164
00:19:37,909 --> 00:19:37,919
and then see how the travel of the
 

1165
00:19:37,919 --> 00:19:39,669
and then see how the travel of the
signal travels kind of thing

1166
00:19:39,669 --> 00:19:39,679
signal travels kind of thing
 

1167
00:19:39,679 --> 00:19:41,029
signal travels kind of thing
fascinating very very fascinating

experiments right you know so i can i

1170
00:19:42,310 --> 00:19:42,320
experiments right you know so i can i
 

1171
00:19:42,320 --> 00:19:44,070
experiments right you know so i can i
can give you one example i was impressed

1172
00:19:44,070 --> 00:19:44,080
can give you one example i was impressed
 

1173
00:19:44,080 --> 00:19:45,430
can give you one example i was impressed
with um this is

1174
00:19:45,430 --> 00:19:45,440
with um this is
 

1175
00:19:45,440 --> 00:19:47,510
with um this is
uh so before going to that let me like

1176
00:19:47,510 --> 00:19:47,520
uh so before going to that let me like
 

1177
00:19:47,520 --> 00:19:50,310
uh so before going to that let me like
let me give you a a you know a

1178
00:19:50,310 --> 00:19:50,320
let me give you a a you know a
 

1179
00:19:50,320 --> 00:19:52,310
let me give you a a you know a
overview of how the the layers in the

1180
00:19:52,310 --> 00:19:52,320
overview of how the the layers in the
 

1181
00:19:52,320 --> 00:19:53,430
overview of how the the layers in the
cortex are organized

1182
00:19:53,430 --> 00:19:53,440
cortex are organized
 

1183
00:19:53,440 --> 00:19:56,230
cortex are organized
right uh visual cortex is organized into

1184
00:19:56,230 --> 00:19:56,240
right uh visual cortex is organized into
 

1185
00:19:56,240 --> 00:19:58,390
right uh visual cortex is organized into
roughly four hierarchical levels

1186
00:19:58,390 --> 00:19:58,400
roughly four hierarchical levels
 

1187
00:19:58,400 --> 00:20:01,669
roughly four hierarchical levels
okay so uh v one v two v four i t

1188
00:20:01,669 --> 00:20:01,679
okay so uh v one v two v four i t
 

1189
00:20:01,679 --> 00:20:05,029
okay so uh v one v two v four i t
and in v one of v three uh well yeah

1190
00:20:05,029 --> 00:20:05,039
and in v one of v three uh well yeah
 

1191
00:20:05,039 --> 00:20:06,630
and in v one of v three uh well yeah
there's another pathway okay

1192
00:20:06,630 --> 00:20:06,640
there's another pathway okay
 

1193
00:20:06,640 --> 00:20:08,470
there's another pathway okay
okay so there's this this is this i'm

1194
00:20:08,470 --> 00:20:08,480
okay so there's this this is this i'm
 

1195
00:20:08,480 --> 00:20:09,430
okay so there's this this is this i'm
talking about just the object

1196
00:20:09,430 --> 00:20:09,440
talking about just the object
 

1197
00:20:09,440 --> 00:20:10,789
talking about just the object
recognition pathway right

1198
00:20:10,789 --> 00:20:10,799
recognition pathway right
 

1199
00:20:10,799 --> 00:20:14,710
recognition pathway right
okay and then um in v1 itself

1200
00:20:14,710 --> 00:20:14,720
okay and then um in v1 itself
 

1201
00:20:14,720 --> 00:20:17,750
okay and then um in v1 itself
um so it's there is a very detailed

1202
00:20:17,750 --> 00:20:17,760
um so it's there is a very detailed
 

1203
00:20:17,760 --> 00:20:19,669
um so it's there is a very detailed
micro circuit in v1 itself there is

1204
00:20:19,669 --> 00:20:19,679
micro circuit in v1 itself there is
 

1205
00:20:19,679 --> 00:20:21,350
micro circuit in v1 itself there is
there is organization within a level

1206
00:20:21,350 --> 00:20:21,360
there is organization within a level
 

1207
00:20:21,360 --> 00:20:21,990
there is organization within a level
itself

1208
00:20:21,990 --> 00:20:22,000
itself
 

1209
00:20:22,000 --> 00:20:25,029
itself
uh the cortical sheet is organized into

1210
00:20:25,029 --> 00:20:25,039
uh the cortical sheet is organized into
 

1211
00:20:25,039 --> 00:20:27,270
uh the cortical sheet is organized into
uh you know multiple layers and there

1212
00:20:27,270 --> 00:20:27,280
uh you know multiple layers and there
 

1213
00:20:27,280 --> 00:20:28,710
uh you know multiple layers and there
are columnar structure

1214
00:20:28,710 --> 00:20:28,720
are columnar structure
 

1215
00:20:28,720 --> 00:20:32,149
are columnar structure
and and this this layer wise and column

1216
00:20:32,149 --> 00:20:32,159
and and this this layer wise and column
 

1217
00:20:32,159 --> 00:20:35,190
and and this this layer wise and column
structure is repeated in v1 v2 v4

1218
00:20:35,190 --> 00:20:35,200
structure is repeated in v1 v2 v4
 

1219
00:20:35,200 --> 00:20:38,310
structure is repeated in v1 v2 v4
uh it all of them right and and

1220
00:20:38,310 --> 00:20:38,320
uh it all of them right and and
 

1221
00:20:38,320 --> 00:20:40,470
uh it all of them right and and
the connections between these layers

1222
00:20:40,470 --> 00:20:40,480
the connections between these layers
 

1223
00:20:40,480 --> 00:20:41,590
the connections between these layers
within a level

1224
00:20:41,590 --> 00:20:41,600
within a level
 

1225
00:20:41,600 --> 00:20:43,590
within a level
with you know in v1 itself there are six

1226
00:20:43,590 --> 00:20:43,600
with you know in v1 itself there are six
 

1227
00:20:43,600 --> 00:20:44,789
with you know in v1 itself there are six
layers roughly

1228
00:20:44,789 --> 00:20:44,799
layers roughly
 

1229
00:20:44,799 --> 00:20:46,549
layers roughly
and the connections between them there

1230
00:20:46,549 --> 00:20:46,559
and the connections between them there
 

1231
00:20:46,559 --> 00:20:48,230
and the connections between them there
is a particular structure to them

1232
00:20:48,230 --> 00:20:48,240
is a particular structure to them
 

1233
00:20:48,240 --> 00:20:51,750
is a particular structure to them
uh and um now so one example

1234
00:20:51,750 --> 00:20:51,760
uh and um now so one example
 

1235
00:20:51,760 --> 00:20:54,870
uh and um now so one example
of an experiment uh uh people did

1236
00:20:54,870 --> 00:20:54,880
of an experiment uh uh people did
 

1237
00:20:54,880 --> 00:20:58,149
of an experiment uh uh people did
is when i when you present a stimulus

1238
00:20:58,149 --> 00:20:58,159
is when i when you present a stimulus
 

1239
00:20:58,159 --> 00:21:01,990
is when i when you present a stimulus
uh which is um let's say requires

1240
00:21:01,990 --> 00:21:02,000
uh which is um let's say requires
 

1241
00:21:02,000 --> 00:21:04,070
uh which is um let's say requires
um separating the foreground from the

1242
00:21:04,070 --> 00:21:04,080
um separating the foreground from the
 

1243
00:21:04,080 --> 00:21:06,070
um separating the foreground from the
background of an object so it is

1244
00:21:06,070 --> 00:21:06,080
background of an object so it is
 

1245
00:21:06,080 --> 00:21:09,430
background of an object so it is
it's a textured triangle on a textured

1246
00:21:09,430 --> 00:21:09,440
it's a textured triangle on a textured
 

1247
00:21:09,440 --> 00:21:10,630
it's a textured triangle on a textured
background

1248
00:21:10,630 --> 00:21:10,640
background
 

1249
00:21:10,640 --> 00:21:13,669
background
and you can check

1250
00:21:13,669 --> 00:21:13,679
and you can check
 

1251
00:21:13,679 --> 00:21:15,990
and you can check
does the surface settle first or does

1252
00:21:15,990 --> 00:21:16,000
does the surface settle first or does
 

1253
00:21:16,000 --> 00:21:19,029
does the surface settle first or does
the contour settle first

1254
00:21:19,029 --> 00:21:19,039
the contour settle first
 

1255
00:21:19,039 --> 00:21:22,390
the contour settle first
cerro settle in the sense that the so

1256
00:21:22,390 --> 00:21:22,400
cerro settle in the sense that the so
 

1257
00:21:22,400 --> 00:21:25,029
cerro settle in the sense that the so
when you find finally form the percept

1258
00:21:25,029 --> 00:21:25,039
when you find finally form the percept
 

1259
00:21:25,039 --> 00:21:25,909
when you find finally form the percept
of the

1260
00:21:25,909 --> 00:21:25,919
of the
 

1261
00:21:25,919 --> 00:21:29,270
of the
of the triangle you understand where the

1262
00:21:29,270 --> 00:21:29,280
of the triangle you understand where the
 

1263
00:21:29,280 --> 00:21:30,950
of the triangle you understand where the
contours of the triangle are

1264
00:21:30,950 --> 00:21:30,960
contours of the triangle are
 

1265
00:21:30,960 --> 00:21:32,789
contours of the triangle are
and you also know where the inside of

1266
00:21:32,789 --> 00:21:32,799
and you also know where the inside of
 

1267
00:21:32,799 --> 00:21:34,470
and you also know where the inside of
the triangle is right that's when you

1268
00:21:34,470 --> 00:21:34,480
the triangle is right that's when you
 

1269
00:21:34,480 --> 00:21:36,070
the triangle is right that's when you
form the final percept

1270
00:21:36,070 --> 00:21:36,080
form the final percept
 

1271
00:21:36,080 --> 00:21:39,990
form the final percept
uh now you can ask what is the dynamics

1272
00:21:39,990 --> 00:21:40,000
uh now you can ask what is the dynamics
 

1273
00:21:40,000 --> 00:21:42,390
uh now you can ask what is the dynamics
of forming that final percept

1274
00:21:42,390 --> 00:21:42,400
of forming that final percept
 

1275
00:21:42,400 --> 00:21:45,669
of forming that final percept
um do the do the

1276
00:21:45,669 --> 00:21:45,679
um do the do the
 

1277
00:21:45,679 --> 00:21:48,870
um do the do the
neurons um first find the edges

1278
00:21:48,870 --> 00:21:48,880
neurons um first find the edges
 

1279
00:21:48,880 --> 00:21:51,909
neurons um first find the edges
and converge on where the edges are and

1280
00:21:51,909 --> 00:21:51,919
and converge on where the edges are and
 

1281
00:21:51,919 --> 00:21:52,630
and converge on where the edges are and
then

1282
00:21:52,630 --> 00:21:52,640
then
 

1283
00:21:52,640 --> 00:21:55,029
then
they find the inner surfaces or does it

1284
00:21:55,029 --> 00:21:55,039
they find the inner surfaces or does it
 

1285
00:21:55,039 --> 00:21:56,789
they find the inner surfaces or does it
go the other way the other way around um

1286
00:21:56,789 --> 00:21:56,799
go the other way the other way around um
 

1287
00:21:56,799 --> 00:21:59,350
go the other way the other way around um
so so what's the answer uh in this case

1288
00:21:59,350 --> 00:21:59,360
so so what's the answer uh in this case
 

1289
00:21:59,360 --> 00:22:00,630
so so what's the answer uh in this case
it it turns out that

1290
00:22:00,630 --> 00:22:00,640
it it turns out that
 

1291
00:22:00,640 --> 00:22:03,669
it it turns out that
it first settles on the edges it it

1292
00:22:03,669 --> 00:22:03,679
it first settles on the edges it it
 

1293
00:22:03,679 --> 00:22:05,990
it first settles on the edges it it
converges on the edge hypothesis first

1294
00:22:05,990 --> 00:22:06,000
converges on the edge hypothesis first
 

1295
00:22:06,000 --> 00:22:09,029
converges on the edge hypothesis first
and then the the surfaces are filled in

1296
00:22:09,029 --> 00:22:09,039
and then the the surfaces are filled in
 

1297
00:22:09,039 --> 00:22:11,190
and then the the surfaces are filled in
from the edges to the inside that's

1298
00:22:11,190 --> 00:22:11,200
from the edges to the inside that's
 

1299
00:22:11,200 --> 00:22:12,789
from the edges to the inside that's
fascinating uh and

1300
00:22:12,789 --> 00:22:12,799
fascinating uh and
 

1301
00:22:12,799 --> 00:22:15,430
fascinating uh and
and the detail to which you can study

1302
00:22:15,430 --> 00:22:15,440
and the detail to which you can study
 

1303
00:22:15,440 --> 00:22:17,350
and the detail to which you can study
this it's it's amazing that you can

1304
00:22:17,350 --> 00:22:17,360
this it's it's amazing that you can
 

1305
00:22:17,360 --> 00:22:18,149
this it's it's amazing that you can
actually

1306
00:22:18,149 --> 00:22:18,159
actually
 

1307
00:22:18,159 --> 00:22:21,029
actually
not only find um the temporal dynamics

1308
00:22:21,029 --> 00:22:21,039
not only find um the temporal dynamics
 

1309
00:22:21,039 --> 00:22:21,350
not only find um the temporal dynamics
of

1310
00:22:21,350 --> 00:22:21,360
of
 

1311
00:22:21,360 --> 00:22:24,070
of
when this happens uh and then you can

1312
00:22:24,070 --> 00:22:24,080
when this happens uh and then you can
 

1313
00:22:24,080 --> 00:22:24,789
when this happens uh and then you can
also find

1314
00:22:24,789 --> 00:22:24,799
also find
 

1315
00:22:24,799 --> 00:22:27,590
also find
which layer in the you know in v1 which

1316
00:22:27,590 --> 00:22:27,600
which layer in the you know in v1 which
 

1317
00:22:27,600 --> 00:22:29,029
which layer in the you know in v1 which
layer is encoding

1318
00:22:29,029 --> 00:22:29,039
layer is encoding
 

1319
00:22:29,039 --> 00:22:32,070
layer is encoding
uh the edges which layer is encoding the

1320
00:22:32,070 --> 00:22:32,080
uh the edges which layer is encoding the
 

1321
00:22:32,080 --> 00:22:32,950
uh the edges which layer is encoding the
surfaces

1322
00:22:32,950 --> 00:22:32,960
surfaces
 

1323
00:22:32,960 --> 00:22:35,830
surfaces
and which layer is encoding the feedback

1324
00:22:35,830 --> 00:22:35,840
and which layer is encoding the feedback
 

1325
00:22:35,840 --> 00:22:37,510
and which layer is encoding the feedback
which there is encoding the feed forward

1326
00:22:37,510 --> 00:22:37,520
which there is encoding the feed forward
 

1327
00:22:37,520 --> 00:22:38,549
which there is encoding the feed forward
and what what's the

1328
00:22:38,549 --> 00:22:38,559
and what what's the
 

1329
00:22:38,559 --> 00:22:40,149
and what what's the
combination of them that produces the

1330

combination of them that produces the
 

1331
00:22:40,159 --> 00:22:42,070
combination of them that produces the
final person um

1332

final person um
 

1333
00:22:42,080 --> 00:22:44,470
final person um
and these kinds of experiments stand out

1334
00:22:44,470 --> 00:22:44,480
and these kinds of experiments stand out
 

1335
00:22:44,480 --> 00:22:45,110
and these kinds of experiments stand out
when

1336
00:22:45,110 --> 00:22:45,120
when
 

1337
00:22:45,120 --> 00:22:48,070
when
you try to explain illusions uh one one

1338
00:22:48,070 --> 00:22:48,080
you try to explain illusions uh one one
 

1339
00:22:48,080 --> 00:22:49,990
you try to explain illusions uh one one
example of a favorite illusion of mine

1340
00:22:49,990 --> 00:22:50,000
example of a favorite illusion of mine
 

1341
00:22:50,000 --> 00:22:51,350
example of a favorite illusion of mine
is the kanetsa triangle i don't know

1342
00:22:51,350 --> 00:22:51,360
is the kanetsa triangle i don't know
 

1343
00:22:51,360 --> 00:22:53,110
is the kanetsa triangle i don't know
that you are familiar with this one

1344
00:22:53,110 --> 00:22:53,120
that you are familiar with this one
 

1345
00:22:53,120 --> 00:22:55,830
that you are familiar with this one
so this is um uh this is an example

1346
00:22:55,830 --> 00:22:55,840
so this is um uh this is an example
 

1347
00:22:55,840 --> 00:22:56,710
so this is um uh this is an example
where

1348
00:22:56,710 --> 00:22:56,720
where
 

1349
00:22:56,720 --> 00:22:59,430
where
it's a triangle uh but you know the

1350
00:22:59,430 --> 00:22:59,440
it's a triangle uh but you know the
 

1351
00:22:59,440 --> 00:23:00,950
it's a triangle uh but you know the
corners of the only the corners of the

1352
00:23:00,950 --> 00:23:00,960
corners of the only the corners of the
 

1353
00:23:00,960 --> 00:23:02,630
corners of the only the corners of the
triangle are shown in the stimuli

1354
00:23:02,630 --> 00:23:02,640
triangle are shown in the stimuli
 

1355
00:23:02,640 --> 00:23:05,110
triangle are shown in the stimuli
the stimulus so they look like kind of

1356
00:23:05,110 --> 00:23:05,120
the stimulus so they look like kind of
 

1357
00:23:05,120 --> 00:23:06,149
the stimulus so they look like kind of
pac-man

1358
00:23:06,149 --> 00:23:06,159
pac-man
 

1359
00:23:06,159 --> 00:23:08,789
pac-man
oh the black pac-man exactly yeah and

1360
00:23:08,789 --> 00:23:08,799
oh the black pac-man exactly yeah and
 

1361
00:23:08,799 --> 00:23:09,990
oh the black pac-man exactly yeah and
then you start to see

1362
00:23:09,990 --> 00:23:10,000
then you start to see
 

1363
00:23:10,000 --> 00:23:12,149
then you start to see
your visual system hallucinates the

1364
00:23:12,149 --> 00:23:12,159
your visual system hallucinates the
 

1365
00:23:12,159 --> 00:23:13,270
your visual system hallucinates the
edges yeah

1366
00:23:13,270 --> 00:23:13,280
edges yeah
 

1367
00:23:13,280 --> 00:23:15,190
edges yeah
um and you can you know you when you

1368
00:23:15,190 --> 00:23:15,200
um and you can you know you when you
 

1369
00:23:15,200 --> 00:23:16,870
um and you can you know you when you
look at it you will see a faint edge

1370
00:23:16,870 --> 00:23:16,880
look at it you will see a faint edge
 

1371
00:23:16,880 --> 00:23:20,070
look at it you will see a faint edge
right and you can go inside the brain

1372
00:23:20,070 --> 00:23:20,080
right and you can go inside the brain
 

1373
00:23:20,080 --> 00:23:23,110
right and you can go inside the brain
and look you know do actually neurons

1374
00:23:23,110 --> 00:23:23,120
and look you know do actually neurons
 

1375
00:23:23,120 --> 00:23:26,149
and look you know do actually neurons
signal the presence of this edge and

1376
00:23:26,149 --> 00:23:26,159
signal the presence of this edge and
 

1377
00:23:26,159 --> 00:23:28,470
signal the presence of this edge and
and if this signal how do they do it

1378
00:23:28,470 --> 00:23:28,480
and if this signal how do they do it
 

1379
00:23:28,480 --> 00:23:29,669
and if this signal how do they do it
because they are not

1380
00:23:29,669 --> 00:23:29,679
because they are not
 

1381
00:23:29,679 --> 00:23:31,909
because they are not
receiving anything from the input in the

1382
00:23:31,909 --> 00:23:31,919
receiving anything from the input in the
 

1383
00:23:31,919 --> 00:23:33,430
receiving anything from the input in the
the input is black

1384
00:23:33,430 --> 00:23:33,440
the input is black
 

1385
00:23:33,440 --> 00:23:36,390
the input is black
for those neurons right uh so how do

1386
00:23:36,390 --> 00:23:36,400
for those neurons right uh so how do
 

1387
00:23:36,400 --> 00:23:37,510
for those neurons right uh so how do
they signal it

1388
00:23:37,510 --> 00:23:37,520
they signal it
 

1389
00:23:37,520 --> 00:23:39,350
they signal it
when does the signaling happen you know

1390
00:23:39,350 --> 00:23:39,360
when does the signaling happen you know
 

1391
00:23:39,360 --> 00:23:40,710
when does the signaling happen you know
does it you know so

1392
00:23:40,710 --> 00:23:40,720
does it you know so
 

1393
00:23:40,720 --> 00:23:42,549
does it you know so
so if a real contour is present in the

1394
00:23:42,549 --> 00:23:42,559
so if a real contour is present in the
 

1395
00:23:42,559 --> 00:23:43,830
so if a real contour is present in the
input then

1396
00:23:43,830 --> 00:23:43,840
input then
 

1397
00:23:43,840 --> 00:23:46,630
input then
the signa the neurons immediately signal

1398
00:23:46,630 --> 00:23:46,640
the signa the neurons immediately signal
 

1399
00:23:46,640 --> 00:23:49,110
the signa the neurons immediately signal
okay there is a there is an edge here

1400
00:23:49,110 --> 00:23:49,120
okay there is a there is an edge here
 

1401
00:23:49,120 --> 00:23:51,990
okay there is a there is an edge here
when when it is an illusory edge um it

1402
00:23:51,990 --> 00:23:52,000
when when it is an illusory edge um it
 

1403
00:23:52,000 --> 00:23:53,430
when when it is an illusory edge um it
is clearly not in the input

1404
00:23:53,430 --> 00:23:53,440
is clearly not in the input
 

1405
00:23:53,440 --> 00:23:56,070
is clearly not in the input
it is coming from the context so those

1406
00:23:56,070 --> 00:23:56,080
it is coming from the context so those
 

1407
00:23:56,080 --> 00:23:57,830
it is coming from the context so those
neurons fire later

1408
00:23:57,830 --> 00:23:57,840
neurons fire later
 

1409
00:23:57,840 --> 00:23:59,909
neurons fire later
and and you can say that okay these are

1410
00:23:59,909 --> 00:23:59,919
and and you can say that okay these are
 

1411
00:23:59,919 --> 00:24:01,430
and and you can say that okay these are
it's the feedback connections that is

1412
00:24:01,430 --> 00:24:01,440
it's the feedback connections that is
 

1413
00:24:01,440 --> 00:24:02,789
it's the feedback connections that is
causing them to fire

1414
00:24:02,789 --> 00:24:02,799
causing them to fire
 

1415
00:24:02,799 --> 00:24:05,990
causing them to fire
uh and and they happen later

1416
00:24:05,990 --> 00:24:06,000
uh and and they happen later
 

1417
00:24:06,000 --> 00:24:09,590
uh and and they happen later
and you can find the dynamics of them so

1418
00:24:09,590 --> 00:24:09,600
and you can find the dynamics of them so
 

1419
00:24:09,600 --> 00:24:11,750
and you can find the dynamics of them so
so these studies are pretty impressive

1420
00:24:11,750 --> 00:24:11,760
so these studies are pretty impressive
 

1421
00:24:11,760 --> 00:24:13,269
so these studies are pretty impressive
and and very detailed

1422
00:24:13,269 --> 00:24:13,279
and and very detailed
 

1423
00:24:13,279 --> 00:24:16,549
and and very detailed
so by the way just uh just take a step

1424
00:24:16,549 --> 00:24:16,559
so by the way just uh just take a step
 

1425
00:24:16,559 --> 00:24:19,190
so by the way just uh just take a step
back you said uh that there may be more

1426
00:24:19,190 --> 00:24:19,200
back you said uh that there may be more
 

1427
00:24:19,200 --> 00:24:20,710
back you said uh that there may be more
feedback connections and feed forward

1428
00:24:20,710 --> 00:24:20,720
feedback connections and feed forward
 

1429
00:24:20,720 --> 00:24:21,990
feedback connections and feed forward
connections yeah

1430
00:24:21,990 --> 00:24:22,000
connections yeah
 

1431
00:24:22,000 --> 00:24:24,390
connections yeah
uh first of all it's just just for like

1432
00:24:24,390 --> 00:24:24,400
uh first of all it's just just for like
 

1433
00:24:24,400 --> 00:24:26,310
uh first of all it's just just for like
a machine learning

1434
00:24:26,310 --> 00:24:26,320
a machine learning
 

1435
00:24:26,320 --> 00:24:29,190
a machine learning
folks yeah i mean that for that's crazy

1436
00:24:29,190 --> 00:24:29,200
folks yeah i mean that for that's crazy
 

1437
00:24:29,200 --> 00:24:29,990
folks yeah i mean that for that's crazy
that there's

1438
00:24:29,990 --> 00:24:30,000
that there's
 

1439
00:24:30,000 --> 00:24:32,310
that there's
all these feedback connections i mean we

1440
00:24:32,310 --> 00:24:32,320
all these feedback connections i mean we
 

1441
00:24:32,320 --> 00:24:33,029
all these feedback connections i mean we
often

1442
00:24:33,029 --> 00:24:33,039
often
 

1443
00:24:33,039 --> 00:24:36,470
often
think about i think

1444
00:24:36,470 --> 00:24:36,480
think about i think
 

1445
00:24:36,480 --> 00:24:38,950
think about i think
thanks to deep learning you start to

1446
00:24:38,950 --> 00:24:38,960
thanks to deep learning you start to
 

1447
00:24:38,960 --> 00:24:39,669
thanks to deep learning you start to
think about

1448
00:24:39,669 --> 00:24:39,679
think about
 

1449
00:24:39,679 --> 00:24:42,390
think about
um the human brain as a kind of feed

1450
00:24:42,390 --> 00:24:42,400
um the human brain as a kind of feed
 

1451
00:24:42,400 --> 00:24:43,510
um the human brain as a kind of feed
forward mechanism

1452
00:24:43,510 --> 00:24:43,520
forward mechanism
 

1453
00:24:43,520 --> 00:24:46,870
forward mechanism
right so what the heck are these

1454
00:24:46,870 --> 00:24:46,880
right so what the heck are these
 

1455
00:24:46,880 --> 00:24:50,070
right so what the heck are these
feedback connections yeah what's their

1456
00:24:50,070 --> 00:24:50,080
feedback connections yeah what's their
 

1457
00:24:50,080 --> 00:24:52,950
feedback connections yeah what's their
what's the dynamics well what are we

1458
00:24:52,950 --> 00:24:52,960
what's the dynamics well what are we
 

1459
00:24:52,960 --> 00:24:54,390
what's the dynamics well what are we
supposed to think about them yeah so

1460
00:24:54,390 --> 00:24:54,400
supposed to think about them yeah so
 

1461
00:24:54,400 --> 00:24:54,950
supposed to think about them yeah so
this is

1462
00:24:54,950 --> 00:24:54,960
this is
 

1463
00:24:54,960 --> 00:24:57,110
this is
this fits into a very beautiful picture

1464
00:24:57,110 --> 00:24:57,120
this fits into a very beautiful picture
 

1465
00:24:57,120 --> 00:24:58,390
this fits into a very beautiful picture
about how the brain works

1466
00:24:58,390 --> 00:24:58,400
about how the brain works
 

1467
00:24:58,400 --> 00:25:01,430
about how the brain works
right um so the the beautiful picture of

1468
00:25:01,430 --> 00:25:01,440
right um so the the beautiful picture of
 

1469
00:25:01,440 --> 00:25:03,669
right um so the the beautiful picture of
how the brain works is that

1470
00:25:03,669 --> 00:25:03,679
how the brain works is that
 

1471
00:25:03,679 --> 00:25:05,830
how the brain works is that
our brain is building a model of the

1472
00:25:05,830 --> 00:25:05,840
our brain is building a model of the
 

1473
00:25:05,840 --> 00:25:06,710
our brain is building a model of the
world

1474
00:25:06,710 --> 00:25:06,720
world
 

1475
00:25:06,720 --> 00:25:09,510
world
uh i know so our visual system is

1476
00:25:09,510 --> 00:25:09,520
uh i know so our visual system is
 

1477
00:25:09,520 --> 00:25:11,110
uh i know so our visual system is
building a model of how

1478
00:25:11,110 --> 00:25:11,120
building a model of how
 

1479
00:25:11,120 --> 00:25:13,750
building a model of how
objects behave in the world and and we

1480
00:25:13,750 --> 00:25:13,760
objects behave in the world and and we
 

1481
00:25:13,760 --> 00:25:15,669
objects behave in the world and and we
are constantly projecting that model

1482
00:25:15,669 --> 00:25:15,679
are constantly projecting that model
 

1483
00:25:15,679 --> 00:25:17,190
are constantly projecting that model
back onto the world

1484
00:25:17,190 --> 00:25:17,200
back onto the world
 

1485
00:25:17,200 --> 00:25:20,310
back onto the world
so what we are seeing is not just a feed

1486
00:25:20,310 --> 00:25:20,320
so what we are seeing is not just a feed
 

1487
00:25:20,320 --> 00:25:20,870
so what we are seeing is not just a feed
forward

1488
00:25:20,870 --> 00:25:20,880
forward
 

1489
00:25:20,880 --> 00:25:22,870
forward
thing that just gets interpreted in in a

1490
00:25:22,870 --> 00:25:22,880
thing that just gets interpreted in in a
 

1491
00:25:22,880 --> 00:25:24,390
thing that just gets interpreted in in a
few word party we are

1492
00:25:24,390 --> 00:25:24,400
few word party we are
 

1493
00:25:24,400 --> 00:25:26,070
few word party we are
constantly projecting our expectations

1494
00:25:26,070 --> 00:25:26,080
constantly projecting our expectations
 

1495
00:25:26,080 --> 00:25:27,590
constantly projecting our expectations
onto the world and

1496
00:25:27,590 --> 00:25:27,600
onto the world and
 

1497
00:25:27,600 --> 00:25:29,510
onto the world and
and what the final percept is a

1498
00:25:29,510 --> 00:25:29,520
and what the final percept is a
 

1499
00:25:29,520 --> 00:25:30,789
and what the final percept is a
combination of

1500
00:25:30,789 --> 00:25:30,799
combination of
 

1501
00:25:30,799 --> 00:25:33,510
combination of
what we project onto the world uh

1502
00:25:33,510 --> 00:25:33,520
what we project onto the world uh
 

1503
00:25:33,520 --> 00:25:35,190
what we project onto the world uh
combined with what the actual sensory

1504
00:25:35,190 --> 00:25:35,200
combined with what the actual sensory
 

1505
00:25:35,200 --> 00:25:36,789
combined with what the actual sensory
input is

1506
00:25:36,789 --> 00:25:36,799
input is
 

1507
00:25:36,799 --> 00:25:38,149
input is
almost like trying to calculate the

1508
00:25:38,149 --> 00:25:38,159
almost like trying to calculate the
 

1509
00:25:38,159 --> 00:25:40,070
almost like trying to calculate the
difference and then trying to interpret

1510
00:25:40,070 --> 00:25:40,080
difference and then trying to interpret
 

1511
00:25:40,080 --> 00:25:40,950
difference and then trying to interpret
the difference

1512
00:25:40,950 --> 00:25:40,960
the difference
 

1513
00:25:40,960 --> 00:25:43,590
the difference
yeah it's it's um i wouldn't put just

1514
00:25:43,590 --> 00:25:43,600
yeah it's it's um i wouldn't put just
 

1515
00:25:43,600 --> 00:25:44,950
yeah it's it's um i wouldn't put just
calculating the difference it's more

1516
00:25:44,950 --> 00:25:44,960
calculating the difference it's more
 

1517
00:25:44,960 --> 00:25:45,350
calculating the difference it's more
like

1518
00:25:45,350 --> 00:25:45,360
like
 

1519
00:25:45,360 --> 00:25:47,909
like
what is the best explanation for the

1520
00:25:47,909 --> 00:25:47,919
what is the best explanation for the
 

1521
00:25:47,919 --> 00:25:49,269
what is the best explanation for the
input stimulus

1522
00:25:49,269 --> 00:25:49,279
input stimulus
 

1523
00:25:49,279 --> 00:25:52,390
input stimulus
based on the model of the world i have

1524
00:25:52,390 --> 00:25:52,400
based on the model of the world i have
 

1525
00:25:52,400 --> 00:25:54,390
based on the model of the world i have
got it got it and that's where all the

1526
00:25:54,390 --> 00:25:54,400
got it got it and that's where all the
 

1527
00:25:54,400 --> 00:25:56,310
got it got it and that's where all the
illusions come in and that's but that's

1528
00:25:56,310 --> 00:25:56,320
illusions come in and that's but that's
 

1529
00:25:56,320 --> 00:25:58,390
illusions come in and that's but that's
that's an incredibly efficient

1530
00:25:58,390 --> 00:25:58,400
that's an incredibly efficient
 

1531
00:25:58,400 --> 00:26:00,630
that's an incredibly efficient
so uh efficient process so the feedback

1532
00:26:00,630 --> 00:26:00,640
so uh efficient process so the feedback
 

1533
00:26:00,640 --> 00:26:01,750
so uh efficient process so the feedback
mechanism it just

1534
00:26:01,750 --> 00:26:01,760
mechanism it just
 

1535
00:26:01,760 --> 00:26:05,430
mechanism it just
helps you constantly uh yeah

1536
00:26:05,430 --> 00:26:05,440
helps you constantly uh yeah
 

1537
00:26:05,440 --> 00:26:07,350
helps you constantly uh yeah
so hallucinate how the world should be

1538
00:26:07,350 --> 00:26:07,360
so hallucinate how the world should be
 

1539
00:26:07,360 --> 00:26:09,190
so hallucinate how the world should be
based on your world model and then just

1540
00:26:09,190 --> 00:26:09,200
based on your world model and then just
 

1541
00:26:09,200 --> 00:26:12,470
based on your world model and then just
looking at uh if there's

1542
00:26:12,470 --> 00:26:12,480
looking at uh if there's
 

1543
00:26:12,480 --> 00:26:15,750
looking at uh if there's
novelty uh like trying to explain it

1544
00:26:15,750 --> 00:26:15,760
novelty uh like trying to explain it
 

1545
00:26:15,760 --> 00:26:16,390
novelty uh like trying to explain it
like that

1546
00:26:16,390 --> 00:26:16,400
like that
 

1547
00:26:16,400 --> 00:26:19,269
like that
hence that's why movement we detect

1548
00:26:19,269 --> 00:26:19,279
hence that's why movement we detect
 

1549
00:26:19,279 --> 00:26:20,870
hence that's why movement we detect
movement really well there's all these

1550
00:26:20,870 --> 00:26:20,880
movement really well there's all these
 

1551
00:26:20,880 --> 00:26:21,669
movement really well there's all these
kinds of things

1552
00:26:21,669 --> 00:26:21,679
kinds of things
 

1553
00:26:21,679 --> 00:26:23,750
kinds of things
and that this is like at all different

1554
00:26:23,750 --> 00:26:23,760
and that this is like at all different
 

1555
00:26:23,760 --> 00:26:24,710
and that this is like at all different
levels

1556
00:26:24,710 --> 00:26:24,720
levels
 

1557
00:26:24,720 --> 00:26:27,269
levels
of the cortex you're saying this happens

1558
00:26:27,269 --> 00:26:27,279
of the cortex you're saying this happens
 

1559
00:26:27,279 --> 00:26:29,269
of the cortex you're saying this happens
at the lowest level or the highest level

1560
00:26:29,269 --> 00:26:29,279
at the lowest level or the highest level
 

1561
00:26:29,279 --> 00:26:31,269
at the lowest level or the highest level
yes yeah in fact feedback connections

1562
00:26:31,269 --> 00:26:31,279
yes yeah in fact feedback connections
 

1563
00:26:31,279 --> 00:26:32,310
yes yeah in fact feedback connections
are more prevalent

1564
00:26:32,310 --> 00:26:32,320
are more prevalent
 

1565
00:26:32,320 --> 00:26:35,430
are more prevalent
in everywhere in the cortex and and um

1566
00:26:35,430 --> 00:26:35,440
in everywhere in the cortex and and um
 

1567
00:26:35,440 --> 00:26:37,590
in everywhere in the cortex and and um
so one way to think about it and there's

1568
00:26:37,590 --> 00:26:37,600
so one way to think about it and there's
 

1569
00:26:37,600 --> 00:26:38,710
so one way to think about it and there's
a lot of evidence for this

1570
00:26:38,710 --> 00:26:38,720
a lot of evidence for this
 

1571
00:26:38,720 --> 00:26:42,310
a lot of evidence for this
is inference um so you know so basically

1572
00:26:42,310 --> 00:26:42,320
is inference um so you know so basically
 

1573
00:26:42,320 --> 00:26:44,310
is inference um so you know so basically
if you have a model of the world and

1574
00:26:44,310 --> 00:26:44,320
if you have a model of the world and
 

1575
00:26:44,320 --> 00:26:45,909
if you have a model of the world and
when when

1576
00:26:45,909 --> 00:26:45,919
when when
 

1577
00:26:45,919 --> 00:26:47,909
when when
some evidence comes in what you are

1578
00:26:47,909 --> 00:26:47,919
some evidence comes in what you are
 

1579
00:26:47,919 --> 00:26:49,350
some evidence comes in what you are
doing is inference

1580
00:26:49,350 --> 00:26:49,360
doing is inference
 

1581
00:26:49,360 --> 00:26:52,470
doing is inference
right you are trying to now explain this

1582
00:26:52,470 --> 00:26:52,480
right you are trying to now explain this
 

1583
00:26:52,480 --> 00:26:54,950
right you are trying to now explain this
evidence using your model of the world

1584
00:26:54,950 --> 00:26:54,960
evidence using your model of the world
 

1585
00:26:54,960 --> 00:26:56,710
evidence using your model of the world
yep and this inference

1586
00:26:56,710 --> 00:26:56,720
yep and this inference
 

1587
00:26:56,720 --> 00:26:59,350
yep and this inference
includes projecting your model onto the

1588
00:26:59,350 --> 00:26:59,360
includes projecting your model onto the
 

1589
00:26:59,360 --> 00:27:00,070
includes projecting your model onto the
evidence

1590
00:27:00,070 --> 00:27:00,080
evidence
 

1591
00:27:00,080 --> 00:27:02,950
evidence
and taking the evidence back into the

1592
00:27:02,950 --> 00:27:02,960
and taking the evidence back into the
 

1593
00:27:02,960 --> 00:27:03,510
and taking the evidence back into the
model

1594
00:27:03,510 --> 00:27:03,520
model
 

1595
00:27:03,520 --> 00:27:06,710
model
and and doing an iterative procedure

1596
00:27:06,710 --> 00:27:06,720
and and doing an iterative procedure
 

1597
00:27:06,720 --> 00:27:09,350
and and doing an iterative procedure
and this iterative procedure is what

1598
00:27:09,350 --> 00:27:09,360
and this iterative procedure is what
 

1599
00:27:09,360 --> 00:27:10,310
and this iterative procedure is what
happens

1600
00:27:10,310 --> 00:27:10,320
happens
 

1601
00:27:10,320 --> 00:27:11,909
happens
using the feed forward feedback

1602
00:27:11,909 --> 00:27:11,919
using the feed forward feedback
 

1603
00:27:11,919 --> 00:27:13,750
using the feed forward feedback
propagation and

1604
00:27:13,750 --> 00:27:13,760
propagation and
 

1605
00:27:13,760 --> 00:27:15,909
propagation and
feedback affects what you see in the

1606
00:27:15,909 --> 00:27:15,919
feedback affects what you see in the
 

1607
00:27:15,919 --> 00:27:17,430
feedback affects what you see in the
world and you know it also affects feed

1608
00:27:17,430 --> 00:27:17,440
world and you know it also affects feed
 

1609
00:27:17,440 --> 00:27:18,710
world and you know it also affects feed
forward propagation

1610
00:27:18,710 --> 00:27:18,720
forward propagation
 

1611
00:27:18,720 --> 00:27:22,230
forward propagation
and examples are everywhere we we see

1612
00:27:22,230 --> 00:27:22,240
and examples are everywhere we we see
 

1613
00:27:22,240 --> 00:27:24,950
and examples are everywhere we we see
these kinds of things everywhere the

1614
00:27:24,950 --> 00:27:24,960
these kinds of things everywhere the
 

1615
00:27:24,960 --> 00:27:25,909
these kinds of things everywhere the
idea that

1616
00:27:25,909 --> 00:27:25,919
idea that
 

1617
00:27:25,919 --> 00:27:27,510
idea that
there can be multiple competing

1618
00:27:27,510 --> 00:27:27,520
there can be multiple competing
 

1619
00:27:27,520 --> 00:27:29,269
there can be multiple competing
hypotheses

1620
00:27:29,269 --> 00:27:29,279
hypotheses
 

1621
00:27:29,279 --> 00:27:31,590
hypotheses
in our model trying to explain the same

1622
00:27:31,590 --> 00:27:31,600
in our model trying to explain the same
 

1623
00:27:31,600 --> 00:27:32,549
in our model trying to explain the same
evidence

1624
00:27:32,549 --> 00:27:32,559
evidence
 

1625
00:27:32,559 --> 00:27:35,110
evidence
and then you have to kind of make them

1626
00:27:35,110 --> 00:27:35,120
and then you have to kind of make them
 

1627
00:27:35,120 --> 00:27:35,830
and then you have to kind of make them
compete

1628
00:27:35,830 --> 00:27:35,840
compete
 

1629
00:27:35,840 --> 00:27:39,110
compete
and one hypothesis will explain away

1630
00:27:39,110 --> 00:27:39,120
and one hypothesis will explain away
 

1631
00:27:39,120 --> 00:27:40,789
and one hypothesis will explain away
the other hypothesis through this

1632
00:27:40,789 --> 00:27:40,799
the other hypothesis through this
 

1633
00:27:40,799 --> 00:27:42,149
the other hypothesis through this
competition process

1634
00:27:42,149 --> 00:27:42,159
competition process
 

1635
00:27:42,159 --> 00:27:45,190
competition process
wait what so you have competing

1636
00:27:45,190 --> 00:27:45,200
wait what so you have competing
 

1637
00:27:45,200 --> 00:27:47,430
wait what so you have competing
models of the world that tried to

1638
00:27:47,430 --> 00:27:47,440
models of the world that tried to
 

1639
00:27:47,440 --> 00:27:50,070
models of the world that tried to
explain what do you mean by explain away

1640
00:27:50,070 --> 00:27:50,080
explain what do you mean by explain away
 

1641
00:27:50,080 --> 00:27:53,029
explain what do you mean by explain away
so this is a classic example in uh uh

1642
00:27:53,029 --> 00:27:53,039
so this is a classic example in uh uh
 

1643
00:27:53,039 --> 00:27:55,669
so this is a classic example in uh uh
graphical models probabilistic models um

1644
00:27:55,669 --> 00:27:55,679
graphical models probabilistic models um
 

1645
00:27:55,679 --> 00:27:58,950
graphical models probabilistic models um
so if you what are those um okay

1646
00:27:58,950 --> 00:27:58,960
so if you what are those um okay
 

1647
00:27:58,960 --> 00:28:02,389
so if you what are those um okay
um i think it's useful to mention

1648
00:28:02,389 --> 00:28:02,399
um i think it's useful to mention
 

1649
00:28:02,399 --> 00:28:04,230
um i think it's useful to mention
because we'll talk about them more

1650
00:28:04,230 --> 00:28:04,240
because we'll talk about them more
 

1651
00:28:04,240 --> 00:28:07,269
because we'll talk about them more
yeah yeah so neural networks

1652
00:28:07,269 --> 00:28:07,279
yeah yeah so neural networks
 

1653
00:28:07,279 --> 00:28:10,149
yeah yeah so neural networks
are one class of machine learning models

1654
00:28:10,149 --> 00:28:10,159
are one class of machine learning models
 

1655
00:28:10,159 --> 00:28:10,950
are one class of machine learning models
um

1656
00:28:10,950 --> 00:28:10,960
um
 

1657
00:28:10,960 --> 00:28:13,350
um
you know you have distributed set of

1658
00:28:13,350 --> 00:28:13,360
you know you have distributed set of
 

1659
00:28:13,360 --> 00:28:15,430
you know you have distributed set of
nodes which are called the neurons

1660
00:28:15,430 --> 00:28:15,440
nodes which are called the neurons
 

1661
00:28:15,440 --> 00:28:17,190
nodes which are called the neurons
you know each one is doing a dot product

1662
00:28:17,190 --> 00:28:17,200
you know each one is doing a dot product
 

1663
00:28:17,200 --> 00:28:18,549
you know each one is doing a dot product
and you can you can approximate any

1664
00:28:18,549 --> 00:28:18,559
and you can you can approximate any
 

1665
00:28:18,559 --> 00:28:19,830
and you can you can approximate any
function using this

1666
00:28:19,830 --> 00:28:19,840
function using this
 

1667
00:28:19,840 --> 00:28:22,549
function using this
a multi-level network of neurons so

1668
00:28:22,549 --> 00:28:22,559
a multi-level network of neurons so
 

1669
00:28:22,559 --> 00:28:23,110
a multi-level network of neurons so
that's

1670
00:28:23,110 --> 00:28:23,120
that's
 

1671
00:28:23,120 --> 00:28:25,510
that's
a class of models which are used for

1672
00:28:25,510 --> 00:28:25,520
a class of models which are used for
 

1673
00:28:25,520 --> 00:28:27,350
a class of models which are used for
useful for function approximation

1674
00:28:27,350 --> 00:28:27,360
useful for function approximation
 

1675
00:28:27,360 --> 00:28:29,510
useful for function approximation
there is another class of models in

1676
00:28:29,510 --> 00:28:29,520
there is another class of models in
 

1677
00:28:29,520 --> 00:28:30,630
there is another class of models in
machine learning

1678
00:28:30,630 --> 00:28:30,640
machine learning
 

1679
00:28:30,640 --> 00:28:33,110
machine learning
called probabilistic graphical models

1680
00:28:33,110 --> 00:28:33,120
called probabilistic graphical models
 

1681
00:28:33,120 --> 00:28:33,909
called probabilistic graphical models
and

1682
00:28:33,909 --> 00:28:33,919
and
 

1683
00:28:33,919 --> 00:28:36,630
and
you can think of them as each node in

1684
00:28:36,630 --> 00:28:36,640
you can think of them as each node in
 

1685
00:28:36,640 --> 00:28:37,430
you can think of them as each node in
that

1686
00:28:37,430 --> 00:28:37,440
that
 

1687
00:28:37,440 --> 00:28:40,389
that
model is variable which is which is

00:28:41,909 --> 00:28:41,919
talking about something you know
 

1691
00:28:41,919 --> 00:28:45,029
talking about something you know
it can be a variable representing is is

1692
00:28:45,029 --> 00:28:45,039
it can be a variable representing is is
 

1693
00:28:45,039 --> 00:28:45,750
it can be a variable representing is is
an edge

1694
00:28:45,750 --> 00:28:45,760
an edge
 

1695
00:28:45,760 --> 00:28:49,190
an edge
present in the input or not and at the

top of the uh network a

1698
00:28:52,710 --> 00:28:52,720
top of the uh network a
 

1699
00:28:52,720 --> 00:28:55,750
top of the uh network a
node can be uh representing is there an

1700
00:28:55,750 --> 00:28:55,760
node can be uh representing is there an
 

1701
00:28:55,760 --> 00:28:57,269
node can be uh representing is there an
object present in the

1702
00:28:57,269 --> 00:28:57,279
object present in the
 

1703
00:28:57,279 --> 00:29:00,389
object present in the
world or not and and then so it can it

1704
00:29:00,389 --> 00:29:00,399
world or not and and then so it can it
 

1705
00:29:00,399 --> 00:29:00,789
world or not and and then so it can it
is

1706
00:29:00,789 --> 00:29:00,799
is
 

1707
00:29:00,799 --> 00:29:03,269

it is another way of encoding knowledge

1708
00:29:03,269 --> 00:29:03,279
it is another way of encoding knowledge
 

1709
00:29:03,279 --> 00:29:04,310
it is another way of encoding knowledge
and uh

1710
00:29:04,310 --> 00:29:04,320
and uh
 

1711
00:29:04,320 --> 00:29:07,590
and uh
um and then you once you encode the

1712
00:29:07,590 --> 00:29:07,600
um and then you once you encode the
 

1713
00:29:07,600 --> 00:29:08,230
um and then you once you encode the
knowledge

1714
00:29:08,230 --> 00:29:08,240
knowledge
 

1715
00:29:08,240 --> 00:29:11,430
knowledge
you can uh do inference

1716
00:29:11,430 --> 00:29:11,440
you can uh do inference
 

1717
00:29:11,440 --> 00:29:12,789
you can uh do inference
in the right way you know how what is

1718
00:29:12,789 --> 00:29:12,799
in the right way you know how what is
 

1719
00:29:12,799 --> 00:29:15,029
in the right way you know how what is
the best way to uh

1720
00:29:15,029 --> 00:29:15,039
the best way to uh
 

1721
00:29:15,039 --> 00:29:17,669
the best way to uh
you know explain some sort of evidence

1722
00:29:17,669 --> 00:29:17,679
you know explain some sort of evidence
 

1723
00:29:17,679 --> 00:29:19,430
you know explain some sort of evidence
using this model that you encoded you

1724
00:29:19,430 --> 00:29:19,440
using this model that you encoded you
 

1725
00:29:19,440 --> 00:29:20,950
using this model that you encoded you
know so when you encode the model

1726
00:29:20,950 --> 00:29:20,960
know so when you encode the model
 

1727
00:29:20,960 --> 00:29:22,710
know so when you encode the model
you are encoding the relationship

1728
00:29:22,710 --> 00:29:22,720
you are encoding the relationship
 

1729
00:29:22,720 --> 00:29:24,070
you are encoding the relationship
between these different variables how is

1730
00:29:24,070 --> 00:29:24,080
between these different variables how is
 

1731
00:29:24,080 --> 00:29:24,870
between these different variables how is
the edge

1732
00:29:24,870 --> 00:29:24,880
the edge
 

1733
00:29:24,880 --> 00:29:27,590
the edge
connected to my the model of the object

1734
00:29:27,590 --> 00:29:27,600
connected to my the model of the object
 

1735
00:29:27,600 --> 00:29:28,870
connected to my the model of the object
how is the surface connected to the

1736
00:29:28,870 --> 00:29:28,880
how is the surface connected to the
 

1737
00:29:28,880 --> 00:29:30,389
how is the surface connected to the
model of the object

1738
00:29:30,389 --> 00:29:30,399
model of the object
 

1739
00:29:30,399 --> 00:29:33,110
model of the object
and then of course this is a very

1740
00:29:33,110 --> 00:29:33,120
and then of course this is a very
 

1741
00:29:33,120 --> 00:29:34,870
and then of course this is a very
distributed complicated model

1742
00:29:34,870 --> 00:29:34,880
distributed complicated model
 

1743
00:29:34,880 --> 00:29:38,149
distributed complicated model
and inference is how do you

1744
00:29:38,149 --> 00:29:38,159
and inference is how do you
 

1745
00:29:38,159 --> 00:29:40,630
and inference is how do you
explain a piece of evidence when a set

1746
00:29:40,630 --> 00:29:40,640
explain a piece of evidence when a set
 

1747
00:29:40,640 --> 00:29:42,070
explain a piece of evidence when a set
of stimulus comes in if somebody tells

1748
00:29:42,070 --> 00:29:42,080
of stimulus comes in if somebody tells
 

1749
00:29:42,080 --> 00:29:42,549
of stimulus comes in if somebody tells
me

1750
00:29:42,549 --> 00:29:42,559
me
 

1751
00:29:42,559 --> 00:29:44,789
me
there is a 50 probability that there is

1752
00:29:44,789 --> 00:29:44,799
there is a 50 probability that there is
 

1753
00:29:44,799 --> 00:29:46,870
there is a 50 probability that there is
an edge here in this part of the model

1754
00:29:46,870 --> 00:29:46,880
an edge here in this part of the model
 

1755
00:29:46,880 --> 00:29:49,430
an edge here in this part of the model
how does that affect my belief on

1756
00:29:49,430 --> 00:29:49,440
how does that affect my belief on
 

1757
00:29:49,440 --> 00:29:50,470
how does that affect my belief on
whether

1758
00:29:50,470 --> 00:29:50,480
whether
 

1759
00:29:50,480 --> 00:29:52,149
whether
i should think that there should be is

1760
00:29:52,149 --> 00:29:52,159
i should think that there should be is
 

1761
00:29:52,159 --> 00:29:54,470
i should think that there should be is
the square present in the image

1762
00:29:54,470 --> 00:29:54,480
the square present in the image
 

1763
00:29:54,480 --> 00:29:56,950
the square present in the image
so so this is the process of inference

1764
00:29:56,950 --> 00:29:56,960
so so this is the process of inference
 

1765
00:29:56,960 --> 00:29:57,669
so so this is the process of inference
so

1766
00:29:57,669 --> 00:29:57,679
so
 

1767
00:29:57,679 --> 00:30:00,470
so
one example of inference is having this

1768
00:30:00,470 --> 00:30:00,480
one example of inference is having this
 

1769
00:30:00,480 --> 00:30:02,149
one example of inference is having this
experience of effect between

1770
00:30:02,149 --> 00:30:02,159
experience of effect between
 

1771
00:30:02,159 --> 00:30:04,789
experience of effect between
multiple causes so uh graphical models

1772
00:30:04,789 --> 00:30:04,799
multiple causes so uh graphical models
 

1773
00:30:04,799 --> 00:30:05,750
multiple causes so uh graphical models
can be

1774
00:30:05,750 --> 00:30:05,760
can be
 

1775
00:30:05,760 --> 00:30:08,310
can be
used to represent causality in the world

1776
00:30:08,310 --> 00:30:08,320
used to represent causality in the world
 

1777
00:30:08,320 --> 00:30:08,870
used to represent causality in the world
um

1778
00:30:08,870 --> 00:30:08,880
um
 

1779
00:30:08,880 --> 00:30:12,789
um
so let's say um you know uh your

1780
00:30:12,789 --> 00:30:12,799
so let's say um you know uh your
 

1781
00:30:12,799 --> 00:30:16,149
so let's say um you know uh your
uh alarm at home

1782
00:30:16,149 --> 00:30:16,159
uh alarm at home
 

1783
00:30:16,159 --> 00:30:20,310
uh alarm at home
can be uh triggered by a

1784
00:30:20,310 --> 00:30:20,320
can be uh triggered by a
 

1785
00:30:20,320 --> 00:30:22,630
can be uh triggered by a
burglar getting into your house uh or it

1786
00:30:22,630 --> 00:30:22,640
burglar getting into your house uh or it
 

1787
00:30:22,640 --> 00:30:23,750
burglar getting into your house uh or it
can be triggered by

1788
00:30:23,750 --> 00:30:23,760
can be triggered by
 

1789
00:30:23,760 --> 00:30:26,470
can be triggered by
an earthquake both both can be causes of

1790
00:30:26,470 --> 00:30:26,480
an earthquake both both can be causes of
 

1791
00:30:26,480 --> 00:30:27,909
an earthquake both both can be causes of
the alarm going off

1792
00:30:27,909 --> 00:30:27,919
the alarm going off
 

1793
00:30:27,919 --> 00:30:30,630
the alarm going off
so now you you're right you know you're

1794
00:30:30,630 --> 00:30:30,640
so now you you're right you know you're
 

1795
00:30:30,640 --> 00:30:31,990
so now you you're right you know you're
in your office you heard

1796
00:30:31,990 --> 00:30:32,000
in your office you heard
 

1797
00:30:32,000 --> 00:30:34,070
in your office you heard
burglar alarm going off you are heading

1798
00:30:34,070 --> 00:30:34,080
burglar alarm going off you are heading
 

1799
00:30:34,080 --> 00:30:35,269
burglar alarm going off you are heading
uh home

1800
00:30:35,269 --> 00:30:35,279
uh home
 

1801
00:30:35,279 --> 00:30:37,430
uh home
thinking that there's a burglar got it

1802
00:30:37,430 --> 00:30:37,440
thinking that there's a burglar got it
 

1803
00:30:37,440 --> 00:30:38,710
thinking that there's a burglar got it
but while driving home

1804
00:30:38,710 --> 00:30:38,720
but while driving home
 

1805
00:30:38,720 --> 00:30:40,230
but while driving home
if you hear on the radio that there was

1806
00:30:40,230 --> 00:30:40,240
if you hear on the radio that there was
 

1807
00:30:40,240 --> 00:30:42,470
if you hear on the radio that there was
an earthquake in the vicinity

1808
00:30:42,470 --> 00:30:42,480
an earthquake in the vicinity
 

1809
00:30:42,480 --> 00:30:45,510
an earthquake in the vicinity
now your hype you know uh strength of

1810
00:30:45,510 --> 00:30:45,520
now your hype you know uh strength of
 

1811
00:30:45,520 --> 00:30:46,789
now your hype you know uh strength of
evidence for

1812
00:30:46,789 --> 00:30:46,799
evidence for
 

1813
00:30:46,799 --> 00:30:48,950
evidence for
a burglar getting into their house is

1814
00:30:48,950 --> 00:30:48,960
a burglar getting into their house is
 

1815
00:30:48,960 --> 00:30:50,149
a burglar getting into their house is
diminished

1816
00:30:50,149 --> 00:30:50,159
diminished
 

1817
00:30:50,159 --> 00:30:52,230
diminished
because now that that piece of evidence

1818
00:30:52,230 --> 00:30:52,240
because now that that piece of evidence
 

1819
00:30:52,240 --> 00:30:53,909
because now that that piece of evidence
is explained by

1820
00:30:53,909 --> 00:30:53,919
is explained by
 

1821
00:30:53,919 --> 00:30:55,909
is explained by
the earthquake being present so if you

1822
00:30:55,909 --> 00:30:55,919
the earthquake being present so if you
 

1823
00:30:55,919 --> 00:30:57,669
the earthquake being present so if you
if you think about these two causes

1824
00:30:57,669 --> 00:30:57,679
if you think about these two causes
 

1825
00:30:57,679 --> 00:30:58,950
if you think about these two causes
explaining at lower level

1826
00:30:58,950 --> 00:30:58,960
explaining at lower level
 

1827
00:30:58,960 --> 00:31:02,070
explaining at lower level
uh variable which is alarm now what we

1828
00:31:02,070 --> 00:31:02,080
uh variable which is alarm now what we
 

1829
00:31:02,080 --> 00:31:03,350
uh variable which is alarm now what we
are seeing is that

1830
00:31:03,350 --> 00:31:03,360
are seeing is that
 

1831
00:31:03,360 --> 00:31:05,990
are seeing is that
increasing the evidence for some cause

1832
00:31:05,990 --> 00:31:06,000
increasing the evidence for some cause
 

1833
00:31:06,000 --> 00:31:06,389
increasing the evidence for some cause
ex

1834
00:31:06,389 --> 00:31:06,399
ex
 

1835
00:31:06,399 --> 00:31:08,070
ex
you know there is evidence coming in

1836
00:31:08,070 --> 00:31:08,080
you know there is evidence coming in
 

1837
00:31:08,080 --> 00:31:10,310
you know there is evidence coming in
from below for alarm being present

1838
00:31:10,310 --> 00:31:10,320
from below for alarm being present
 

1839
00:31:10,320 --> 00:31:12,870
from below for alarm being present
and initially it was flowing to a

1840
00:31:12,870 --> 00:31:12,880
and initially it was flowing to a
 

1841
00:31:12,880 --> 00:31:13,669
and initially it was flowing to a
burglar

1842
00:31:13,669 --> 00:31:13,679
burglar
 

1843
00:31:13,679 --> 00:31:16,149
burglar
being present but now since somebody

1844
00:31:16,149 --> 00:31:16,159
being present but now since somebody
 

1845
00:31:16,159 --> 00:31:16,870
being present but now since somebody
some this

1846
00:31:16,870 --> 00:31:16,880
some this
 

1847
00:31:16,880 --> 00:31:18,310
some this
there the side evidence for this other

1848
00:31:18,310 --> 00:31:18,320
there the side evidence for this other
 

1849
00:31:18,320 --> 00:31:21,190
there the side evidence for this other
cause it explains away this evidence and

1850
00:31:21,190 --> 00:31:21,200
cause it explains away this evidence and
 

1851
00:31:21,200 --> 00:31:22,630
cause it explains away this evidence and
it evidence will now flow to the other

1852
00:31:22,630 --> 00:31:22,640
it evidence will now flow to the other
 

1853
00:31:22,640 --> 00:31:23,430
it evidence will now flow to the other
course

1854
00:31:23,430 --> 00:31:23,440
course
 

1855
00:31:23,440 --> 00:31:26,070
course
this is you know two competing causal uh

1856
00:31:26,070 --> 00:31:26,080
this is you know two competing causal uh
 

1857
00:31:26,080 --> 00:31:26,549
this is you know two competing causal uh
things

1858
00:31:26,549 --> 00:31:26,559
things
 

1859
00:31:26,559 --> 00:31:28,630
things
trying to explain the same evidence and

1860
00:31:28,630 --> 00:31:28,640
trying to explain the same evidence and
 

1861
00:31:28,640 --> 00:31:30,149
trying to explain the same evidence and
the brain has a similar kind of

1862
00:31:30,149 --> 00:31:30,159
the brain has a similar kind of
 

1863
00:31:30,159 --> 00:31:31,350
the brain has a similar kind of
mechanism

1864
00:31:31,350 --> 00:31:31,360
mechanism
 

1865
00:31:31,360 --> 00:31:33,830
mechanism
for doing so that's kind of interesting

1866
00:31:33,830 --> 00:31:33,840
for doing so that's kind of interesting
 

1867
00:31:33,840 --> 00:31:35,509
for doing so that's kind of interesting
and that

1868
00:31:35,509 --> 00:31:35,519
and that
 

1869
00:31:35,519 --> 00:31:38,630
and that
how's that all encoded in the brain like

1870
00:31:38,630 --> 00:31:38,640
how's that all encoded in the brain like
 

1871
00:31:38,640 --> 00:31:40,389
how's that all encoded in the brain like
where's the storage of information are

1872
00:31:40,389 --> 00:31:40,399
where's the storage of information are
 

1873
00:31:40,399 --> 00:31:41,669
where's the storage of information are
we talking

1874
00:31:41,669 --> 00:31:41,679
we talking
 

1875
00:31:41,679 --> 00:31:44,389
we talking
just maybe to get it a little bit more

1876
00:31:44,389 --> 00:31:44,399
just maybe to get it a little bit more
 

1877
00:31:44,399 --> 00:31:45,590
just maybe to get it a little bit more
specific

1878
00:31:45,590 --> 00:31:45,600
specific
 

1879
00:31:45,600 --> 00:31:47,269
specific
is it in the hardware of the actual

1880
00:31:47,269 --> 00:31:47,279
is it in the hardware of the actual
 

1881
00:31:47,279 --> 00:31:48,789
is it in the hardware of the actual
connections is it

1882
00:31:48,789 --> 00:31:48,799
connections is it
 

1883
00:31:48,799 --> 00:31:51,350
connections is it
in uh chemical communication is it

1884
00:31:51,350 --> 00:31:51,360
in uh chemical communication is it
 

1885
00:31:51,360 --> 00:31:53,110
in uh chemical communication is it
electrical communication

1886
00:31:53,110 --> 00:31:53,120
electrical communication
 

1887
00:31:53,120 --> 00:31:55,669
electrical communication
do we do we know so this is you know a

1888
00:31:55,669 --> 00:31:55,679
do we do we know so this is you know a
 

1889
00:31:55,679 --> 00:31:57,350
do we do we know so this is you know a
paper that we are bringing out

1890
00:31:57,350 --> 00:31:57,360
paper that we are bringing out
 

1891
00:31:57,360 --> 00:32:00,070
paper that we are bringing out
soon which one this is the cortical

1892
00:32:00,070 --> 00:32:00,080
soon which one this is the cortical
 

1893
00:32:00,080 --> 00:32:01,750
soon which one this is the cortical
micro circuits paper that

1894
00:32:01,750 --> 00:32:01,760
micro circuits paper that
 

1895
00:32:01,760 --> 00:32:03,990
micro circuits paper that
i sent you a draft of of course this is

1896
00:32:03,990 --> 00:32:04,000
i sent you a draft of of course this is
 

1897
00:32:04,000 --> 00:32:06,230
i sent you a draft of of course this is
uh a lot of it is still hypothesis one

1898
00:32:06,230 --> 00:32:06,240
uh a lot of it is still hypothesis one
 

1899
00:32:06,240 --> 00:32:07,509
uh a lot of it is still hypothesis one
hypothesis is that

1900
00:32:07,509 --> 00:32:07,519
hypothesis is that
 

1901
00:32:07,519 --> 00:32:10,310
hypothesis is that
a you can think of a cortical column as

1902
00:32:10,310 --> 00:32:10,320
a you can think of a cortical column as
 

1903
00:32:10,320 --> 00:32:11,750
a you can think of a cortical column as
encoding a

1904
00:32:11,750 --> 00:32:11,760
encoding a
 

1905
00:32:11,760 --> 00:32:14,389
encoding a
a concept a concept you know think of it

1906
00:32:14,389 --> 00:32:14,399
a concept a concept you know think of it
 

1907
00:32:14,399 --> 00:32:17,350
a concept a concept you know think of it
as say

1908
00:32:17,350 --> 00:32:17,360

 

1909
00:32:17,360 --> 00:32:20,870

an example of a concept is um is an edge

1910
00:32:20,870 --> 00:32:20,880
an example of a concept is um is an edge
 

1911
00:32:20,880 --> 00:32:22,149
an example of a concept is um is an edge
present or not

1912
00:32:22,149 --> 00:32:22,159
present or not
 

1913
00:32:22,159 --> 00:32:25,350
present or not
or is is an object present or not okay

1914
00:32:25,350 --> 00:32:25,360
or is is an object present or not okay
 

1915
00:32:25,360 --> 00:32:26,549
or is is an object present or not okay
so it can you can think of it as a

1916
00:32:26,549 --> 00:32:26,559
so it can you can think of it as a
 

1917
00:32:26,559 --> 00:32:28,710
so it can you can think of it as a
binary variable a binary random variable

1918
00:32:28,710 --> 00:32:28,720
binary variable a binary random variable
 

1919
00:32:28,720 --> 00:32:30,549
binary variable a binary random variable
the presence of an edge or not or the

1920
00:32:30,549 --> 00:32:30,559
the presence of an edge or not or the
 

1921
00:32:30,559 --> 00:32:32,070
the presence of an edge or not or the
presence of an object or not

1922
00:32:32,070 --> 00:32:32,080
presence of an object or not
 

1923
00:32:32,080 --> 00:32:34,149
presence of an object or not
so each cortical column can be thought

1924
00:32:34,149 --> 00:32:34,159
so each cortical column can be thought
 

1925
00:32:34,159 --> 00:32:35,430
so each cortical column can be thought
of as representing

1926
00:32:35,430 --> 00:32:35,440
of as representing
 

1927
00:32:35,440 --> 00:32:38,950
of as representing
that one concept one variable and then

1928
00:32:38,950 --> 00:32:38,960
that one concept one variable and then
 

1929
00:32:38,960 --> 00:32:40,630
that one concept one variable and then
the connections between these cortical

1930
00:32:40,630 --> 00:32:40,640
the connections between these cortical
 

1931
00:32:40,640 --> 00:32:43,029
the connections between these cortical
columns are basically encoding

1932
00:32:43,029 --> 00:32:43,039
columns are basically encoding
 

1933
00:32:43,039 --> 00:32:44,549
columns are basically encoding
the relationship between these random

1934
00:32:44,549 --> 00:32:44,559
the relationship between these random
 

1935
00:32:44,559 --> 00:32:46,149
the relationship between these random
variables and

1936
00:32:46,149 --> 00:32:46,159
variables and
 

1937
00:32:46,159 --> 00:32:47,909
variables and
then there are connections within the

1938
00:32:47,909 --> 00:32:47,919
then there are connections within the
 

1939
00:32:47,919 --> 00:32:49,430
then there are connections within the
cortical column there are

1940
00:32:49,430 --> 00:32:49,440
cortical column there are
 

1941
00:32:49,440 --> 00:32:51,110
cortical column there are
each cortical column is implemented

1942
00:32:51,110 --> 00:32:51,120
each cortical column is implemented
 

1943
00:32:51,120 --> 00:32:53,110
each cortical column is implemented
using multiple layers of neurons

1944
00:32:53,110 --> 00:32:53,120
using multiple layers of neurons
 

1945
00:32:53,120 --> 00:32:56,470
using multiple layers of neurons
with very very very rich um

1946
00:32:56,470 --> 00:32:56,480
with very very very rich um
 

1947
00:32:56,480 --> 00:32:57,990
with very very very rich um
structure there you know there are

1948
00:32:57,990 --> 00:32:58,000
structure there you know there are
 

1949
00:32:58,000 --> 00:32:59,590
structure there you know there are
thousands of neurons in a cortical

1950
00:32:59,590 --> 00:32:59,600
thousands of neurons in a cortical
 

1951
00:32:59,600 --> 00:33:00,310
thousands of neurons in a cortical
column

1952
00:33:00,310 --> 00:33:00,320
column
 

1953
00:33:00,320 --> 00:33:02,389
column
but but that structure is similar across

1954
00:33:02,389 --> 00:33:02,399
but but that structure is similar across
 

1955
00:33:02,399 --> 00:33:03,990
but but that structure is similar across
the different cortical columns

1956
00:33:03,990 --> 00:33:04,000
the different cortical columns
 

1957
00:33:04,000 --> 00:33:05,909
the different cortical columns
yeah correct and also these cortical

1958
00:33:05,909 --> 00:33:05,919
yeah correct and also these cortical
 

1959
00:33:05,919 --> 00:33:07,590
yeah correct and also these cortical
columns collect connect to a

1960
00:33:07,590 --> 00:33:07,600
columns collect connect to a
 

1961
00:33:07,600 --> 00:33:09,190
columns collect connect to a
substructure called thalamus

1962
00:33:09,190 --> 00:33:09,200
substructure called thalamus
 

1963
00:33:09,200 --> 00:33:11,509
substructure called thalamus
in the uh you know so all all cortical

1964
00:33:11,509 --> 00:33:11,519
in the uh you know so all all cortical
 

1965
00:33:11,519 --> 00:33:12,310
in the uh you know so all all cortical
columns

1966
00:33:12,310 --> 00:33:12,320
columns
 

1967
00:33:12,320 --> 00:33:14,950
columns
pass through this substructure so our

1968
00:33:14,950 --> 00:33:14,960
pass through this substructure so our
 

1969
00:33:14,960 --> 00:33:15,909
pass through this substructure so our
hypothesis

1970
00:33:15,909 --> 00:33:15,919
hypothesis
 

1971
00:33:15,919 --> 00:33:17,990
hypothesis
is that yeah the connections between the

1972
00:33:17,990 --> 00:33:18,000
is that yeah the connections between the
 

1973
00:33:18,000 --> 00:33:18,950
is that yeah the connections between the
cortical columns

1974
00:33:18,950 --> 00:33:18,960
cortical columns
 

1975
00:33:18,960 --> 00:33:21,509
cortical columns
implement this uh you know that's where

1976
00:33:21,509 --> 00:33:21,519
implement this uh you know that's where
 

1977
00:33:21,519 --> 00:33:22,789
implement this uh you know that's where
the knowledge is stored

1978
00:33:22,789 --> 00:33:22,799
the knowledge is stored
 

1979
00:33:22,799 --> 00:33:24,630
the knowledge is stored
about you know how these different

1980
00:33:24,630 --> 00:33:24,640
about you know how these different
 

1981
00:33:24,640 --> 00:33:27,190
about you know how these different
connects concepts connect to each other

1982
00:33:27,190 --> 00:33:27,200
connects concepts connect to each other
 

1983
00:33:27,200 --> 00:33:29,990
connects concepts connect to each other
and then the the neurons inside this

1984
00:33:29,990 --> 00:33:30,000
and then the the neurons inside this
 

1985
00:33:30,000 --> 00:33:31,909
and then the the neurons inside this
cortical column and in thalamus in

1986
00:33:31,909 --> 00:33:31,919
cortical column and in thalamus in
 

1987
00:33:31,919 --> 00:33:33,029
cortical column and in thalamus in
combination

1988
00:33:33,029 --> 00:33:33,039
combination
 

1989
00:33:33,039 --> 00:33:36,389
combination
implement this uh actual computations

1990
00:33:36,389 --> 00:33:36,399
implement this uh actual computations
 

1991
00:33:36,399 --> 00:33:37,430
implement this uh actual computations
needed for

1992
00:33:37,430 --> 00:33:37,440
needed for
 

1993
00:33:37,440 --> 00:33:39,350
needed for
inference which includes explaining a

1994
00:33:39,350 --> 00:33:39,360
inference which includes explaining a
 

1995
00:33:39,360 --> 00:33:41,669
inference which includes explaining a
way and competing between the different

1996
00:33:41,669 --> 00:33:41,679
way and competing between the different
 

1997
00:33:41,679 --> 00:33:45,990
way and competing between the different
uh hypotheses um and it is all very

1998
00:33:45,990 --> 00:33:46,000
uh hypotheses um and it is all very
 

1999
00:33:46,000 --> 00:33:48,389
uh hypotheses um and it is all very
so what is amazing is that uh

2000
00:33:48,389 --> 00:33:48,399
so what is amazing is that uh
 

2001
00:33:48,399 --> 00:33:49,269
so what is amazing is that uh
neuroscientists have

2002
00:33:49,269 --> 00:33:49,279
neuroscientists have
 

2003
00:33:49,279 --> 00:33:52,710
neuroscientists have
actually done experiments to the tune of

2004
00:33:52,710 --> 00:33:52,720
actually done experiments to the tune of
 

2005
00:33:52,720 --> 00:33:54,950
actually done experiments to the tune of
showing these things they might not be

2006
00:33:54,950 --> 00:33:54,960
showing these things they might not be
 

2007
00:33:54,960 --> 00:33:57,190
showing these things they might not be
putting it in the overall

2008
00:33:57,190 --> 00:33:57,200
putting it in the overall
 

2009
00:33:57,200 --> 00:33:59,430
putting it in the overall
inference framework but they will show

2010
00:33:59,430 --> 00:33:59,440
inference framework but they will show
 

2011
00:33:59,440 --> 00:34:00,389
inference framework but they will show
things like

2012
00:34:00,389 --> 00:34:00,399
things like
 

2013
00:34:00,399 --> 00:34:03,350
things like
if i poke this higher level neuron it

2014
00:34:03,350 --> 00:34:03,360
if i poke this higher level neuron it
 

2015
00:34:03,360 --> 00:34:04,549
if i poke this higher level neuron it
will inhibit

2016
00:34:04,549 --> 00:34:04,559
will inhibit
 

2017
00:34:04,559 --> 00:34:06,070
will inhibit
through this complicated loop through

2018
00:34:06,070 --> 00:34:06,080
through this complicated loop through
 

2019
00:34:06,080 --> 00:34:07,990
through this complicated loop through
the thalamus it will inhibit this other

2020
00:34:07,990 --> 00:34:08,000
the thalamus it will inhibit this other
 

2021
00:34:08,000 --> 00:34:09,270
the thalamus it will inhibit this other
column

2022
00:34:09,270 --> 00:34:09,280
column
 

2023
00:34:09,280 --> 00:34:11,829
column
uh so they will do such experiments but

2024
00:34:11,829 --> 00:34:11,839
uh so they will do such experiments but
 

2025
00:34:11,839 --> 00:34:12,629
uh so they will do such experiments but
do they use

2026
00:34:12,629 --> 00:34:12,639
do they use
 

2027
00:34:12,639 --> 00:34:15,190
do they use
terminology of concepts for example so

2028
00:34:15,190 --> 00:34:15,200
terminology of concepts for example so
 

2029
00:34:15,200 --> 00:34:15,990
terminology of concepts for example so
so

2030
00:34:15,990 --> 00:34:16,000
so
 

2031
00:34:16,000 --> 00:34:19,510
so
you're i mean is it uh

2032
00:34:19,510 --> 00:34:19,520
you're i mean is it uh
 

2033
00:34:19,520 --> 00:34:22,030
you're i mean is it uh
is it something where it's easy to

2034
00:34:22,030 --> 00:34:22,040
is it something where it's easy to
 

2035
00:34:22,040 --> 00:34:23,589
is it something where it's easy to
anthropomorphize

2036
00:34:23,589 --> 00:34:23,599
anthropomorphize
 

2037
00:34:23,599 --> 00:34:25,909
anthropomorphize
and think about concepts like you start

2038
00:34:25,909 --> 00:34:25,919
and think about concepts like you start
 

2039
00:34:25,919 --> 00:34:26,710
and think about concepts like you start
moving into

2040
00:34:26,710 --> 00:34:26,720
moving into
 

2041
00:34:26,720 --> 00:34:30,470
moving into
logic based kind of reasoning systems so

2042
00:34:30,470 --> 00:34:30,480
logic based kind of reasoning systems so
 

2043
00:34:30,480 --> 00:34:32,710
logic based kind of reasoning systems so
um i would just think of concepts in

2044
00:34:32,710 --> 00:34:32,720
um i would just think of concepts in
 

2045
00:34:32,720 --> 00:34:34,069
um i would just think of concepts in
that kind of way

2046
00:34:34,069 --> 00:34:34,079
that kind of way
 

2047
00:34:34,079 --> 00:34:37,909
that kind of way
or is it is it a lot messier

2048
00:34:37,909 --> 00:34:37,919
or is it is it a lot messier
 

2049
00:34:37,919 --> 00:34:41,270
or is it is it a lot messier
a lot more gray area you know

2050
00:34:41,270 --> 00:34:41,280
a lot more gray area you know
 

2051
00:34:41,280 --> 00:34:44,950
a lot more gray area you know
even even more gray even more messy than

2052
00:34:44,950 --> 00:34:44,960
even even more gray even more messy than
 

2053
00:34:44,960 --> 00:34:47,669
even even more gray even more messy than
the artificial neural network kinds of

2054
00:34:47,669 --> 00:34:47,679
the artificial neural network kinds of
 

2055
00:34:47,679 --> 00:34:48,389
the artificial neural network kinds of
abstractions

2056
00:34:48,389 --> 00:34:48,399
abstractions
 

2057
00:34:48,399 --> 00:34:49,829
abstractions
the easiest way to think of it as a

2058
00:34:49,829 --> 00:34:49,839
the easiest way to think of it as a
 

2059
00:34:49,839 --> 00:34:51,990
the easiest way to think of it as a
variable right it's a binary variable

2060
00:34:51,990 --> 00:34:52,000
variable right it's a binary variable
 

2061
00:34:52,000 --> 00:34:54,149
variable right it's a binary variable
which is showing the presence or absence

2062
00:34:54,149 --> 00:34:54,159
which is showing the presence or absence
 

2063
00:34:54,159 --> 00:34:55,030
which is showing the presence or absence
of

2064
00:34:55,030 --> 00:34:55,040
of
 

2065
00:34:55,040 --> 00:34:57,030
of
something so but i guess what i'm asking

2066
00:34:57,030 --> 00:34:57,040
something so but i guess what i'm asking
 

2067
00:34:57,040 --> 00:34:58,069
something so but i guess what i'm asking
is

2068
00:34:58,069 --> 00:34:58,079
is
 

2069
00:34:58,079 --> 00:35:01,190
is
is that something that we're supposed to

2070
00:35:01,190 --> 00:35:01,200
is that something that we're supposed to
 

2071
00:35:01,200 --> 00:35:02,470
is that something that we're supposed to
think of something that's human

2072
00:35:02,470 --> 00:35:02,480
think of something that's human
 

2073
00:35:02,480 --> 00:35:03,270
think of something that's human
interpretable

2074
00:35:03,270 --> 00:35:03,280
interpretable
 

2075
00:35:03,280 --> 00:35:05,349
interpretable
of that something it doesn't need to be

2076
00:35:05,349 --> 00:35:05,359
of that something it doesn't need to be
 

2077
00:35:05,359 --> 00:35:06,390
of that something it doesn't need to be
it doesn't need to be human

2078
00:35:06,390 --> 00:35:06,400
it doesn't need to be human
 

2079
00:35:06,400 --> 00:35:07,910
it doesn't need to be human
interpretable there's no need for it to

2080
00:35:07,910 --> 00:35:07,920
interpretable there's no need for it to
 

2081
00:35:07,920 --> 00:35:09,670
interpretable there's no need for it to
be human interpretable uh

2082
00:35:09,670 --> 00:35:09,680
be human interpretable uh
 

2083
00:35:09,680 --> 00:35:13,750
be human interpretable uh
but it's it's almost like um

2084
00:35:13,750 --> 00:35:13,760
but it's it's almost like um
 

2085
00:35:13,760 --> 00:35:16,470
but it's it's almost like um
you you will be able to find some

2086
00:35:16,470 --> 00:35:16,480
you you will be able to find some
 

2087
00:35:16,480 --> 00:35:17,829
you you will be able to find some
interpretation of it

2088
00:35:17,829 --> 00:35:17,839
interpretation of it
 

2089
00:35:17,839 --> 00:35:20,310
interpretation of it
uh because it is connected to the other

2090
00:35:20,310 --> 00:35:20,320
uh because it is connected to the other
 

2091
00:35:20,320 --> 00:35:22,069
uh because it is connected to the other
things yes that you know

2092
00:35:22,069 --> 00:35:22,079
things yes that you know
 

2093
00:35:22,079 --> 00:35:24,870
things yes that you know
and the the point is it's useful somehow

2094
00:35:24,870 --> 00:35:24,880
and the the point is it's useful somehow
 

2095
00:35:24,880 --> 00:35:25,349
and the the point is it's useful somehow
yeah

2096
00:35:25,349 --> 00:35:25,359
yeah
 

2097
00:35:25,359 --> 00:35:28,550
yeah
it's useful as an entity

2098
00:35:28,550 --> 00:35:28,560
it's useful as an entity
 

2099
00:35:28,560 --> 00:35:31,349
it's useful as an entity
in the graph that in connecting to the

2100
00:35:31,349 --> 00:35:31,359
in the graph that in connecting to the
 

2101
00:35:31,359 --> 00:35:32,870
in the graph that in connecting to the
other entities that are

2102
00:35:32,870 --> 00:35:32,880
other entities that are
 

2103
00:35:32,880 --> 00:35:35,829
other entities that are
let's call them concepts right okay so

2104
00:35:35,829 --> 00:35:35,839
let's call them concepts right okay so
 

2105
00:35:35,839 --> 00:35:37,349
let's call them concepts right okay so
uh by the way what's

2106
00:35:37,349 --> 00:35:37,359
uh by the way what's
 

2107
00:35:37,359 --> 00:35:39,910
uh by the way what's
are these the cortical micro circuits

2108
00:35:39,910 --> 00:35:39,920
are these the cortical micro circuits
 

2109
00:35:39,920 --> 00:35:41,190
are these the cortical micro circuits
correct these are the cortical micro

2110
00:35:41,190 --> 00:35:41,200
correct these are the cortical micro
 

2111
00:35:41,200 --> 00:35:41,910
correct these are the cortical micro
circuits

2112
00:35:41,910 --> 00:35:41,920
circuits
 

2113
00:35:41,920 --> 00:35:43,589
circuits
you know that's what neuroscientists use

2114
00:35:43,589 --> 00:35:43,599
you know that's what neuroscientists use
 

2115
00:35:43,599 --> 00:35:44,950
you know that's what neuroscientists use
to talk about

2116
00:35:44,950 --> 00:35:44,960
to talk about
 

2117
00:35:44,960 --> 00:35:48,069
to talk about
the circuits in in uh within a level of

2118
00:35:48,069 --> 00:35:48,079
the circuits in in uh within a level of
 

2119
00:35:48,079 --> 00:35:49,030
the circuits in in uh within a level of
the cortex

2120
00:35:49,030 --> 00:35:49,040
the cortex
 

2121
00:35:49,040 --> 00:35:50,790
the cortex
so you can think of you know let's think

2122
00:35:50,790 --> 00:35:50,800
so you can think of you know let's think
 

2123
00:35:50,800 --> 00:35:52,310
so you can think of you know let's think
of a neural

2124
00:35:52,310 --> 00:35:52,320
of a neural
 

2125
00:35:52,320 --> 00:35:53,910
of a neural
network in artificial neural network

2126
00:35:53,910 --> 00:35:53,920
network in artificial neural network
 

2127
00:35:53,920 --> 00:35:55,430
network in artificial neural network
terms you know people talk about the

2128
00:35:55,430 --> 00:35:55,440
terms you know people talk about the
 

2129
00:35:55,440 --> 00:35:56,950
terms you know people talk about the
architecture of the you know so

2130
00:35:56,950 --> 00:35:56,960
architecture of the you know so
 

2131
00:35:56,960 --> 00:35:59,510
architecture of the you know so
how many how many layers they build uh

2132
00:35:59,510 --> 00:35:59,520
how many how many layers they build uh
 

2133
00:35:59,520 --> 00:36:00,630
how many how many layers they build uh
you know what is the fan

2134
00:36:00,630 --> 00:36:00,640
you know what is the fan
 

2135
00:36:00,640 --> 00:36:02,550
you know what is the fan
in fan out etc that is the macro

2136
00:36:02,550 --> 00:36:02,560
in fan out etc that is the macro
 

2137
00:36:02,560 --> 00:36:04,310
in fan out etc that is the macro
architecture

2138
00:36:04,310 --> 00:36:04,320
architecture
 

2139
00:36:04,320 --> 00:36:07,430
architecture
so and then within a layer of the

2140
00:36:07,430 --> 00:36:07,440
so and then within a layer of the
 

2141
00:36:07,440 --> 00:36:10,470
so and then within a layer of the
neural network you can you know the

2142
00:36:10,470 --> 00:36:10,480
neural network you can you know the
 

2143
00:36:10,480 --> 00:36:11,030
neural network you can you know the
cortical

2144
00:36:11,030 --> 00:36:11,040
cortical
 

2145
00:36:11,040 --> 00:36:13,190
cortical
neural network is much more structured

2146
00:36:13,190 --> 00:36:13,200
neural network is much more structured
 

2147
00:36:13,200 --> 00:36:14,790
neural network is much more structured
with you know within a level there's a

2148
00:36:14,790 --> 00:36:14,800
with you know within a level there's a
 

2149
00:36:14,800 --> 00:36:15,990
with you know within a level there's a
lot more intricate

2150
00:36:15,990 --> 00:36:16,000
lot more intricate
 

2151
00:36:16,000 --> 00:36:18,870
lot more intricate
structure there uh but even um even

2152
00:36:18,870 --> 00:36:18,880
structure there uh but even um even
 

2153
00:36:18,880 --> 00:36:20,390
structure there uh but even um even
within an artificial neural network you

2154
00:36:20,390 --> 00:36:20,400
within an artificial neural network you
 

2155
00:36:20,400 --> 00:36:21,190
within an artificial neural network you
can think of

2156
00:36:21,190 --> 00:36:21,200
can think of
 

2157
00:36:21,200 --> 00:36:23,910
can think of
in feature detection plus pooling as one

2158
00:36:23,910 --> 00:36:23,920
in feature detection plus pooling as one
 

2159
00:36:23,920 --> 00:36:24,790
in feature detection plus pooling as one
one level

2160
00:36:24,790 --> 00:36:24,800
one level
 

2161
00:36:24,800 --> 00:36:27,030
one level
and so that is kind of a micro circuit

2162
00:36:27,030 --> 00:36:27,040
and so that is kind of a micro circuit
 

2163
00:36:27,040 --> 00:36:28,950
and so that is kind of a micro circuit
uh it's much more

2164
00:36:28,950 --> 00:36:28,960
uh it's much more
 

2165
00:36:28,960 --> 00:36:32,310
uh it's much more
uh complex in the real brain uh and

2166
00:36:32,310 --> 00:36:32,320
uh complex in the real brain uh and
 

2167
00:36:32,320 --> 00:36:34,790
uh complex in the real brain uh and
and so within a level whatever is that

2168
00:36:34,790 --> 00:36:34,800
and so within a level whatever is that
 

2169
00:36:34,800 --> 00:36:36,390
and so within a level whatever is that
circuitry within a column

2170
00:36:36,390 --> 00:36:36,400
circuitry within a column
 

2171
00:36:36,400 --> 00:36:38,550
circuitry within a column
of the cortex and between the layers of

2172
00:36:38,550 --> 00:36:38,560
of the cortex and between the layers of
 

2173
00:36:38,560 --> 00:36:40,870
of the cortex and between the layers of
the cortex that's the micro circuitry

2174
00:36:40,870 --> 00:36:40,880
the cortex that's the micro circuitry
 

2175
00:36:40,880 --> 00:36:42,790
the cortex that's the micro circuitry
i love that terminology uh machine

2176
00:36:42,790 --> 00:36:42,800
i love that terminology uh machine
 

2177
00:36:42,800 --> 00:36:44,069
i love that terminology uh machine
learning people don't use

2178
00:36:44,069 --> 00:36:44,079
learning people don't use
 

2179
00:36:44,079 --> 00:36:46,390
learning people don't use
the circuit terminology right but they

2180
00:36:46,390 --> 00:36:46,400
the circuit terminology right but they
 

2181
00:36:46,400 --> 00:36:48,710
the circuit terminology right but they
should it's a nice so okay

2182
00:36:48,710 --> 00:36:48,720
should it's a nice so okay
 

2183
00:36:48,720 --> 00:36:52,790
should it's a nice so okay
uh okay so that's uh that that's the

2184
00:36:52,790 --> 00:36:52,800
uh okay so that's uh that that's the
 

2185
00:36:52,800 --> 00:36:54,230
uh okay so that's uh that that's the
the cortical micro circuit so what's

2186
00:36:54,230 --> 00:36:54,240
the cortical micro circuit so what's
 

2187
00:36:54,240 --> 00:36:56,310
the cortical micro circuit so what's
interesting about

2188
00:36:56,310 --> 00:36:56,320
interesting about
 

2189
00:36:56,320 --> 00:36:59,030
interesting about
what can we say what is the paper that

2190
00:36:59,030 --> 00:36:59,040
what can we say what is the paper that
 

2191
00:36:59,040 --> 00:37:00,710
what can we say what is the paper that
you're working on

2192
00:37:00,710 --> 00:37:00,720
you're working on
 

2193
00:37:00,720 --> 00:37:02,870
you're working on
propose about the ideas around these

2194
00:37:02,870 --> 00:37:02,880
propose about the ideas around these
 

2195
00:37:02,880 --> 00:37:04,390
propose about the ideas around these
cortical micro circuits

2196
00:37:04,390 --> 00:37:04,400
cortical micro circuits
 

2197
00:37:04,400 --> 00:37:07,589
cortical micro circuits
so this is a fully functional

2198
00:37:07,589 --> 00:37:07,599
so this is a fully functional
 

2199
00:37:07,599 --> 00:37:09,670
so this is a fully functional
model for the micro circuits of the

2200
00:37:09,670 --> 00:37:09,680
model for the micro circuits of the
 

2201
00:37:09,680 --> 00:37:10,710
model for the micro circuits of the
visual cortex

2202
00:37:10,710 --> 00:37:10,720
visual cortex
 

2203
00:37:10,720 --> 00:37:12,550
visual cortex
so the the paper focuses and your idea

2204
00:37:12,550 --> 00:37:12,560
so the the paper focuses and your idea
 

2205
00:37:12,560 --> 00:37:14,710
so the the paper focuses and your idea
in our discussions now is focusing on

2206
00:37:14,710 --> 00:37:14,720
in our discussions now is focusing on
 

2207
00:37:14,720 --> 00:37:18,310
in our discussions now is focusing on
vision yeah the uh visual cortex

2208
00:37:18,310 --> 00:37:18,320
vision yeah the uh visual cortex
 

2209
00:37:18,320 --> 00:37:20,069
vision yeah the uh visual cortex
okay yeah this is a model this is a full

2210
00:37:20,069 --> 00:37:20,079
okay yeah this is a model this is a full
 

2211
00:37:20,079 --> 00:37:22,870
okay yeah this is a model this is a full
model it says this is how vision works

2212
00:37:22,870 --> 00:37:22,880
model it says this is how vision works
 

2213
00:37:22,880 --> 00:37:25,430
model it says this is how vision works
but this is this is a model of science

2214
00:37:25,430 --> 00:37:25,440
but this is this is a model of science
 

2215
00:37:25,440 --> 00:37:27,430
but this is this is a model of science
yeah hypothesis okay so let me let me

2216
00:37:27,430 --> 00:37:27,440
yeah hypothesis okay so let me let me
 

2217
00:37:27,440 --> 00:37:27,990
yeah hypothesis okay so let me let me
step back

2218
00:37:27,990 --> 00:37:28,000
step back
 

2219
00:37:28,000 --> 00:37:31,670
step back
a bit um so we looked at neuroscience

2220
00:37:31,670 --> 00:37:31,680
a bit um so we looked at neuroscience
 

2221
00:37:31,680 --> 00:37:34,150
a bit um so we looked at neuroscience
for insights on how to build a vision

2222
00:37:34,150 --> 00:37:34,160
for insights on how to build a vision
 

2223
00:37:34,160 --> 00:37:34,870
for insights on how to build a vision
model

2224
00:37:34,870 --> 00:37:34,880
model
 

2225
00:37:34,880 --> 00:37:37,510
model
right and and and we synthesized all

2226
00:37:37,510 --> 00:37:37,520
right and and and we synthesized all
 

2227
00:37:37,520 --> 00:37:38,870
right and and and we synthesized all
those insights into a

2228
00:37:38,870 --> 00:37:38,880
those insights into a
 

2229
00:37:38,880 --> 00:37:40,150
those insights into a
computational model this is called the

2230
00:37:40,150 --> 00:37:40,160
computational model this is called the
 

2231
00:37:40,160 --> 00:37:41,910
computational model this is called the
recursive vertical network model

2232
00:37:41,910 --> 00:37:41,920
recursive vertical network model
 

2233
00:37:41,920 --> 00:37:45,109
recursive vertical network model
that we we used for breaking captchas

2234
00:37:45,109 --> 00:37:45,119
that we we used for breaking captchas
 

2235
00:37:45,119 --> 00:37:47,750
that we we used for breaking captchas
and and we are using the same model for

2236
00:37:47,750 --> 00:37:47,760
and and we are using the same model for
 

2237
00:37:47,760 --> 00:37:48,790
and and we are using the same model for
robotic picking

2238
00:37:48,790 --> 00:37:48,800
robotic picking
 

2239
00:37:48,800 --> 00:37:50,950
robotic picking
and uh tracking of objects and that

2240
00:37:50,950 --> 00:37:50,960
and uh tracking of objects and that
 

2241
00:37:50,960 --> 00:37:52,390
and uh tracking of objects and that
again is the vision system

2242
00:37:52,390 --> 00:37:52,400
again is the vision system
 

2243
00:37:52,400 --> 00:37:54,470
again is the vision system
that's the best computer vision system

2244
00:37:54,470 --> 00:37:54,480
that's the best computer vision system
 

2245
00:37:54,480 --> 00:37:55,430
that's the best computer vision system
that's the computer mission

2246
00:37:55,430 --> 00:37:55,440
that's the computer mission
 

2247
00:37:55,440 --> 00:37:59,109
that's the computer mission
takes in images and outputs what

2248
00:37:59,109 --> 00:37:59,119
takes in images and outputs what
 

2249
00:37:59,119 --> 00:38:00,950
takes in images and outputs what
on one side it outputs the class of the

2250
00:38:00,950 --> 00:38:00,960
on one side it outputs the class of the
 

2251
00:38:00,960 --> 00:38:02,230
on one side it outputs the class of the
image

2252
00:38:02,230 --> 00:38:02,240
image
 

2253
00:38:02,240 --> 00:38:05,430
image
and also segments the image uh

2254
00:38:05,430 --> 00:38:05,440
and also segments the image uh
 

2255
00:38:05,440 --> 00:38:07,349
and also segments the image uh
and you can also ask it further queries

2256
00:38:07,349 --> 00:38:07,359
and you can also ask it further queries
 

2257
00:38:07,359 --> 00:38:08,950
and you can also ask it further queries
where is the edge of the object where is

2258
00:38:08,950 --> 00:38:08,960
where is the edge of the object where is
 

2259
00:38:08,960 --> 00:38:10,470
where is the edge of the object where is
the interior of the object

2260
00:38:10,470 --> 00:38:10,480
the interior of the object
 

2261
00:38:10,480 --> 00:38:13,589
the interior of the object
so so it's a model that you build to

2262
00:38:13,589 --> 00:38:13,599
so so it's a model that you build to
 

2263
00:38:13,599 --> 00:38:14,950
so so it's a model that you build to
answer multiple questions

2264
00:38:14,950 --> 00:38:14,960
answer multiple questions
 

2265
00:38:14,960 --> 00:38:16,550
answer multiple questions
so you are not trying to build a model

2266
00:38:16,550 --> 00:38:16,560
so you are not trying to build a model
 

2267
00:38:16,560 --> 00:38:18,069
so you are not trying to build a model
for just classification

2268
00:38:18,069 --> 00:38:18,079
for just classification
 

2269
00:38:18,079 --> 00:38:20,230
for just classification
or just segmentation etc so it's a it's

2270
00:38:20,230 --> 00:38:20,240
or just segmentation etc so it's a it's
 

2271
00:38:20,240 --> 00:38:22,710
or just segmentation etc so it's a it's
a it's a joint model that can do

2272
00:38:22,710 --> 00:38:22,720
a it's a joint model that can do
 

2273
00:38:22,720 --> 00:38:25,990
a it's a joint model that can do
multiple things um and um so

2274
00:38:25,990 --> 00:38:26,000
multiple things um and um so
 

2275
00:38:26,000 --> 00:38:28,310
multiple things um and um so
so that's the model that we built using

2276
00:38:28,310 --> 00:38:28,320
so that's the model that we built using
 

2277
00:38:28,320 --> 00:38:29,589
so that's the model that we built using
insights from

2278
00:38:29,589 --> 00:38:29,599
insights from
 

2279
00:38:29,599 --> 00:38:31,589
insights from
neuroscience and some of those insights

2280
00:38:31,589 --> 00:38:31,599
neuroscience and some of those insights
 

2281
00:38:31,599 --> 00:38:33,270
neuroscience and some of those insights
are what is the role of feedback

2282
00:38:33,270 --> 00:38:33,280
are what is the role of feedback
 

2283
00:38:33,280 --> 00:38:34,069
are what is the role of feedback
connections

2284
00:38:34,069 --> 00:38:34,079
connections
 

2285
00:38:34,079 --> 00:38:35,750
connections
what is the role of lateral connections

2286
00:38:35,750 --> 00:38:35,760
what is the role of lateral connections
 

2287
00:38:35,760 --> 00:38:37,589
what is the role of lateral connections
uh so all those things went into the

2288
00:38:37,589 --> 00:38:37,599
uh so all those things went into the
 

2289
00:38:37,599 --> 00:38:38,630
uh so all those things went into the
model the model

2290
00:38:38,630 --> 00:38:38,640
model the model
 

2291
00:38:38,640 --> 00:38:40,950
model the model
actually uses feedback connections all

2292
00:38:40,950 --> 00:38:40,960
actually uses feedback connections all
 

2293
00:38:40,960 --> 00:38:42,390
actually uses feedback connections all
these ideas from you know from your

2294
00:38:42,390 --> 00:38:42,400
these ideas from you know from your
 

2295
00:38:42,400 --> 00:38:42,950
these ideas from you know from your
science

2296
00:38:42,950 --> 00:38:42,960
science
 

2297
00:38:42,960 --> 00:38:45,190
science
yeah so what what what the heck is a

2298
00:38:45,190 --> 00:38:45,200
yeah so what what what the heck is a
 

2299
00:38:45,200 --> 00:38:46,950
yeah so what what what the heck is a
recursive cortical network like what

2300
00:38:46,950 --> 00:38:46,960
recursive cortical network like what
 

2301
00:38:46,960 --> 00:38:49,190
recursive cortical network like what
what are the architecture approaches

2302
00:38:49,190 --> 00:38:49,200
what are the architecture approaches
 

2303
00:38:49,200 --> 00:38:51,829
what are the architecture approaches
interesting aspects here

2304
00:38:51,829 --> 00:38:51,839
interesting aspects here
 

2305
00:38:51,839 --> 00:38:54,230
interesting aspects here
which is essentially a brain inspired

2306
00:38:54,230 --> 00:38:54,240
which is essentially a brain inspired
 

2307
00:38:54,240 --> 00:38:54,870
which is essentially a brain inspired
approach

2308
00:38:54,870 --> 00:38:54,880
approach
 

2309
00:38:54,880 --> 00:38:57,510
approach
to computer vision yeah so there are

2310
00:38:57,510 --> 00:38:57,520
to computer vision yeah so there are
 

2311
00:38:57,520 --> 00:38:59,270
to computer vision yeah so there are
multiple layers to this question

2312
00:38:59,270 --> 00:38:59,280
multiple layers to this question
 

2313
00:38:59,280 --> 00:39:02,230
multiple layers to this question
i can go from the very very top and then

2314
00:39:02,230 --> 00:39:02,240
i can go from the very very top and then
 

2315
00:39:02,240 --> 00:39:03,349
i can go from the very very top and then
zoom in okay

2316
00:39:03,349 --> 00:39:03,359
zoom in okay
 

2317
00:39:03,359 --> 00:39:06,230
zoom in okay
so one important thing constraint that

2318
00:39:06,230 --> 00:39:06,240
so one important thing constraint that
 

2319
00:39:06,240 --> 00:39:07,829
so one important thing constraint that
went into the model is that

2320
00:39:07,829 --> 00:39:07,839
went into the model is that
 

2321
00:39:07,839 --> 00:39:10,310
went into the model is that
you should not think vision think of

2322
00:39:10,310 --> 00:39:10,320
you should not think vision think of
 

2323
00:39:10,320 --> 00:39:11,030
you should not think vision think of
vision

2324
00:39:11,030 --> 00:39:11,040
vision
 

2325
00:39:11,040 --> 00:39:13,270
vision
as something in isolation we should not

2326
00:39:13,270 --> 00:39:13,280
as something in isolation we should not
 

2327
00:39:13,280 --> 00:39:14,470
as something in isolation we should not
think perception

2328
00:39:14,470 --> 00:39:14,480
think perception
 

2329
00:39:14,480 --> 00:39:17,270
think perception
as something as a preprocessor for

2330
00:39:17,270 --> 00:39:17,280
as something as a preprocessor for
 

2331
00:39:17,280 --> 00:39:18,790
as something as a preprocessor for
cognition

2332
00:39:18,790 --> 00:39:18,800
cognition
 

2333
00:39:18,800 --> 00:39:20,390
cognition
perception and cognition are

2334
00:39:20,390 --> 00:39:20,400
perception and cognition are
 

2335
00:39:20,400 --> 00:39:22,550
perception and cognition are
interconnected and so you should not

2336
00:39:22,550 --> 00:39:22,560
interconnected and so you should not
 

2337
00:39:22,560 --> 00:39:23,349
interconnected and so you should not
think of

2338
00:39:23,349 --> 00:39:23,359
think of
 

2339
00:39:23,359 --> 00:39:25,030
think of
one problem in separation from the other

2340
00:39:25,030 --> 00:39:25,040
one problem in separation from the other
 

2341
00:39:25,040 --> 00:39:26,630
one problem in separation from the other
problem um and

2342
00:39:26,630 --> 00:39:26,640
problem um and
 

2343
00:39:26,640 --> 00:39:29,109
problem um and
so that means if you finally want to

2344
00:39:29,109 --> 00:39:29,119
so that means if you finally want to
 

2345
00:39:29,119 --> 00:39:30,550
so that means if you finally want to
have a system that understand

2346
00:39:30,550 --> 00:39:30,560
have a system that understand
 

2347
00:39:30,560 --> 00:39:32,710
have a system that understand
concepts uh about the world and can

2348
00:39:32,710 --> 00:39:32,720
concepts uh about the world and can
 

2349
00:39:32,720 --> 00:39:34,870
concepts uh about the world and can
learn in a very conceptual model of the

2350
00:39:34,870 --> 00:39:34,880
learn in a very conceptual model of the
 

2351
00:39:34,880 --> 00:39:35,589
learn in a very conceptual model of the
world

2352
00:39:35,589 --> 00:39:35,599
world
 

2353
00:39:35,599 --> 00:39:37,589
world
and can reason and connect to language

2354
00:39:37,589 --> 00:39:37,599
and can reason and connect to language
 

2355
00:39:37,599 --> 00:39:38,710
and can reason and connect to language
all of those things

2356
00:39:38,710 --> 00:39:38,720
all of those things
 

2357
00:39:38,720 --> 00:39:40,950
all of those things
you need to you need to have think all

2358
00:39:40,950 --> 00:39:40,960
you need to you need to have think all
 

2359
00:39:40,960 --> 00:39:42,069
you need to you need to have think all
the way through and

2360
00:39:42,069 --> 00:39:42,079
the way through and
 

2361
00:39:42,079 --> 00:39:44,230
the way through and
make sure that your perception system is

2362
00:39:44,230 --> 00:39:44,240
make sure that your perception system is
 

2363
00:39:44,240 --> 00:39:45,270
make sure that your perception system is
compatible with

2364
00:39:45,270 --> 00:39:45,280
compatible with
 

2365
00:39:45,280 --> 00:39:46,710
compatible with
your cognition system and language

2366
00:39:46,710 --> 00:39:46,720
your cognition system and language
 

2367
00:39:46,720 --> 00:39:48,710
your cognition system and language
system and all of them and one

2368
00:39:48,710 --> 00:39:48,720
system and all of them and one
 

2369
00:39:48,720 --> 00:39:50,710
system and all of them and one
aspect of that is top-down

2370
00:39:50,710 --> 00:39:50,720
aspect of that is top-down
 

2371
00:39:50,720 --> 00:39:53,109
aspect of that is top-down
controllability

2372
00:39:53,109 --> 00:39:53,119
controllability
 

2373
00:39:53,119 --> 00:39:55,589
controllability
um what does that mean so that means you

2374
00:39:55,589 --> 00:39:55,599
um what does that mean so that means you
 

2375
00:39:55,599 --> 00:39:56,390
um what does that mean so that means you
know so

2376
00:39:56,390 --> 00:39:56,400
know so
 

2377
00:39:56,400 --> 00:39:58,390
know so
so think of it you know you can close

2378
00:39:58,390 --> 00:39:58,400
so think of it you know you can close
 

2379
00:39:58,400 --> 00:39:59,750
so think of it you know you can close
your eyes and

2380
00:39:59,750 --> 00:39:59,760
your eyes and
 

2381
00:39:59,760 --> 00:40:02,710
your eyes and
think about the details of one object

2382
00:40:02,710 --> 00:40:02,720
think about the details of one object
 

2383
00:40:02,720 --> 00:40:03,990
think about the details of one object
right i can i can

2384
00:40:03,990 --> 00:40:04,000
right i can i can
 

2385
00:40:04,000 --> 00:40:05,829
right i can i can
zoom in further and further i can you

2386
00:40:05,829 --> 00:40:05,839
zoom in further and further i can you
 

2387
00:40:05,839 --> 00:40:07,750
zoom in further and further i can you
know so so think of the bottle in front

2388
00:40:07,750 --> 00:40:07,760
know so so think of the bottle in front
 

2389
00:40:07,760 --> 00:40:08,230
know so so think of the bottle in front
of me

2390
00:40:08,230 --> 00:40:08,240
of me
 

2391
00:40:08,240 --> 00:40:11,349
of me
right and and now you can think about

2392
00:40:11,349 --> 00:40:11,359
right and and now you can think about
 

2393
00:40:11,359 --> 00:40:13,750
right and and now you can think about
okay what the cap of that bottle looks

2394
00:40:13,750 --> 00:40:13,760
okay what the cap of that bottle looks
 

2395
00:40:13,760 --> 00:40:15,589
okay what the cap of that bottle looks
uh i know we can think about what's the

2396
00:40:15,589 --> 00:40:15,599
uh i know we can think about what's the
 

2397
00:40:15,599 --> 00:40:16,950
uh i know we can think about what's the
texture on that bottle

2398
00:40:16,950 --> 00:40:16,960
texture on that bottle
 

2399
00:40:16,960 --> 00:40:20,069
texture on that bottle
of the of the cap you know you can think

2400
00:40:20,069 --> 00:40:20,079
of the of the cap you know you can think
 

2401
00:40:20,079 --> 00:40:20,710
of the of the cap you know you can think
about

2402
00:40:20,710 --> 00:40:20,720
about
 

2403
00:40:20,720 --> 00:40:22,870
about
you know what will happen if uh

2404
00:40:22,870 --> 00:40:22,880
you know what will happen if uh
 

2405
00:40:22,880 --> 00:40:23,990
you know what will happen if uh
something hits that

2406
00:40:23,990 --> 00:40:24,000
something hits that
 

2407
00:40:24,000 --> 00:40:27,109
something hits that
uh so you can you can you can manipulate

2408
00:40:27,109 --> 00:40:27,119
uh so you can you can you can manipulate
 

2409
00:40:27,119 --> 00:40:30,390
uh so you can you can you can manipulate
your visual knowledge in uh

2410
00:40:30,390 --> 00:40:30,400
your visual knowledge in uh
 

2411
00:40:30,400 --> 00:40:33,589
your visual knowledge in uh
cognition driven ways yes uh and so

2412
00:40:33,589 --> 00:40:33,599
cognition driven ways yes uh and so
 

2413
00:40:33,599 --> 00:40:36,470
cognition driven ways yes uh and so
this top-down controllability uh and

2414
00:40:36,470 --> 00:40:36,480
this top-down controllability uh and
 

2415
00:40:36,480 --> 00:40:37,510
this top-down controllability uh and
being able to

2416
00:40:37,510 --> 00:40:37,520
being able to
 

2417
00:40:37,520 --> 00:40:40,630
being able to
simulate scenarios in the world so

2418
00:40:40,630 --> 00:40:40,640
simulate scenarios in the world so
 

2419
00:40:40,640 --> 00:40:43,510
simulate scenarios in the world so
you're not just a passive uh

2420
00:40:43,510 --> 00:40:43,520
you're not just a passive uh
 

2421
00:40:43,520 --> 00:40:46,150
you're not just a passive uh
player in this perception game you you

2422
00:40:46,150 --> 00:40:46,160
player in this perception game you you
 

2423
00:40:46,160 --> 00:40:48,230
player in this perception game you you
can you can control it you gotta you

2424
00:40:48,230 --> 00:40:48,240
can you can control it you gotta you
 

2425
00:40:48,240 --> 00:40:51,270
can you can control it you gotta you
you have imagination correct so so

2426
00:40:51,270 --> 00:40:51,280
you have imagination correct so so
 

2427
00:40:51,280 --> 00:40:53,270
you have imagination correct so so
so basically you know basically having a

2428
00:40:53,270 --> 00:40:53,280
so basically you know basically having a
 

2429
00:40:53,280 --> 00:40:54,390
so basically you know basically having a
generating network

2430
00:40:54,390 --> 00:40:54,400
generating network
 

2431
00:40:54,400 --> 00:40:56,870
generating network
yeah which is a model and and it is not

2432
00:40:56,870 --> 00:40:56,880
yeah which is a model and and it is not
 

2433
00:40:56,880 --> 00:40:57,510
yeah which is a model and and it is not
just some

2434
00:40:57,510 --> 00:40:57,520
just some
 

2435
00:40:57,520 --> 00:40:59,910
just some
arbitrary generated network it has to be

2436
00:40:59,910 --> 00:40:59,920
arbitrary generated network it has to be
 

2437
00:40:59,920 --> 00:41:01,670
arbitrary generated network it has to be
it has to be built in a way that it is

2438
00:41:01,670 --> 00:41:01,680
it has to be built in a way that it is
 

2439
00:41:01,680 --> 00:41:02,870
it has to be built in a way that it is
controllable top-down

2440
00:41:02,870 --> 00:41:02,880
controllable top-down
 

2441
00:41:02,880 --> 00:41:05,030
controllable top-down
it is it is not just trying to generate

2442
00:41:05,030 --> 00:41:05,040
it is it is not just trying to generate
 

2443
00:41:05,040 --> 00:41:05,990
it is it is not just trying to generate
a whole picture

2444
00:41:05,990 --> 00:41:06,000
a whole picture
 

2445
00:41:06,000 --> 00:41:08,550
a whole picture
at once uh you know it's not trying to

2446
00:41:08,550 --> 00:41:08,560
at once uh you know it's not trying to
 

2447
00:41:08,560 --> 00:41:10,150
at once uh you know it's not trying to
generate photorealistic things of the

2448
00:41:10,150 --> 00:41:10,160
generate photorealistic things of the
 

2449
00:41:10,160 --> 00:41:10,870
generate photorealistic things of the
world you

2450
00:41:10,870 --> 00:41:10,880
world you
 

2451
00:41:10,880 --> 00:41:11,829
world you
you know you don't have good

2452
00:41:11,829 --> 00:41:11,839
you know you don't have good
 

2453
00:41:11,839 --> 00:41:13,430
you know you don't have good
photorealistic models of the world human

2454
00:41:13,430 --> 00:41:13,440
photorealistic models of the world human
 

2455
00:41:13,440 --> 00:41:14,710
photorealistic models of the world human
brains do not have if i

2456
00:41:14,710 --> 00:41:14,720
brains do not have if i
 

2457
00:41:14,720 --> 00:41:17,270
brains do not have if i
if i for example ask you the question uh

2458
00:41:17,270 --> 00:41:17,280
if i for example ask you the question uh
 

2459
00:41:17,280 --> 00:41:18,870
if i for example ask you the question uh
what is the color of the letter

2460
00:41:18,870 --> 00:41:18,880
what is the color of the letter
 

2461
00:41:18,880 --> 00:41:22,230
what is the color of the letter
e in the google logo

2462
00:41:22,230 --> 00:41:22,240
e in the google logo
 

2463
00:41:22,240 --> 00:41:24,069
e in the google logo
you have no idea right now yeah although

2464
00:41:24,069 --> 00:41:24,079
you have no idea right now yeah although
 

2465
00:41:24,079 --> 00:41:26,710
you have no idea right now yeah although
you have seen it millions of times

2466
00:41:26,710 --> 00:41:26,720
you have seen it millions of times
 

2467
00:41:26,720 --> 00:41:29,349
you have seen it millions of times
hundreds of times so yeah so it's not

2468
00:41:29,349 --> 00:41:29,359
hundreds of times so yeah so it's not
 

2469
00:41:29,359 --> 00:41:31,190
hundreds of times so yeah so it's not
our model is not photorealistic

2470
00:41:31,190 --> 00:41:31,200
our model is not photorealistic
 

2471
00:41:31,200 --> 00:41:33,349
our model is not photorealistic
but but it is but it has other

2472
00:41:33,349 --> 00:41:33,359
but but it is but it has other
 

2473
00:41:33,359 --> 00:41:35,109
but but it is but it has other
properties that we can manipulate it

2474
00:41:35,109 --> 00:41:35,119
properties that we can manipulate it
 

2475
00:41:35,119 --> 00:41:37,430
properties that we can manipulate it
uh in the uh and you can think about

2476
00:41:37,430 --> 00:41:37,440
uh in the uh and you can think about
 

2477
00:41:37,440 --> 00:41:38,710
uh in the uh and you can think about

you can think about expanding the the

2482
00:41:41,190 --> 00:41:41,200
you can think about expanding the the
 

2483
00:41:41,200 --> 00:41:42,630
you can think about expanding the the
letter e yeah

2484
00:41:42,630 --> 00:41:42,640
letter e yeah
 

2485
00:41:42,640 --> 00:41:44,950
letter e yeah
you know you can see what in so you can

2486
00:41:44,950 --> 00:41:44,960
you know you can see what in so you can
 

2487
00:41:44,960 --> 00:41:46,870
you know you can see what in so you can
imagine the consequence of

2488
00:41:46,870 --> 00:41:46,880
imagine the consequence of
 

2489
00:41:46,880 --> 00:41:47,990
imagine the consequence of
you know actions that you have never

2490
00:41:47,990 --> 00:41:48,000
you know actions that you have never
 

2491
00:41:48,000 --> 00:41:49,990
you know actions that you have never
performed so so these are the

2492
00:41:49,990 --> 00:41:50,000
performed so so these are the
 

2493
00:41:50,000 --> 00:41:51,430
performed so so these are the
kind of characteristics the genetic

2494
00:41:51,430 --> 00:41:51,440
kind of characteristics the genetic
 

2495
00:41:51,440 --> 00:41:53,349
kind of characteristics the genetic
model need to have so this is one

2496
00:41:53,349 --> 00:41:53,359
model need to have so this is one
 

2497
00:41:53,359 --> 00:41:54,870
model need to have so this is one
constraint that went into our model like

2498
00:41:54,870 --> 00:41:54,880
constraint that went into our model like
 

2499
00:41:54,880 --> 00:41:56,150
constraint that went into our model like
you know so this is

2500
00:41:56,150 --> 00:41:56,160
you know so this is
 

2501
00:41:56,160 --> 00:41:58,150
you know so this is
when you read the just the perception

2502
00:41:58,150 --> 00:41:58,160
when you read the just the perception
 

2503
00:41:58,160 --> 00:42:00,150
when you read the just the perception
side of the paper it is not obvious that

2504
00:42:00,150 --> 00:42:00,160
side of the paper it is not obvious that
 

2505
00:42:00,160 --> 00:42:01,349
side of the paper it is not obvious that
this was a constraint

2506
00:42:01,349 --> 00:42:01,359
this was a constraint
 

2507
00:42:01,359 --> 00:42:03,109
this was a constraint
into the inter that went into the model

2508
00:42:03,109 --> 00:42:03,119
into the inter that went into the model
 

2509
00:42:03,119 --> 00:42:04,950
into the inter that went into the model
this top-down controllability

2510
00:42:04,950 --> 00:42:04,960
this top-down controllability
 

2511
00:42:04,960 --> 00:42:07,109
this top-down controllability
of the generating model uh so what what

2512
00:42:07,109 --> 00:42:07,119
of the generating model uh so what what
 

2513
00:42:07,119 --> 00:42:09,190
of the generating model uh so what what
does the top-down controllability

2514
00:42:09,190 --> 00:42:09,200
does the top-down controllability
 

2515
00:42:09,200 --> 00:42:12,309
does the top-down controllability
in a model look like

2516
00:42:12,309 --> 00:42:12,319
in a model look like
 

2517
00:42:12,319 --> 00:42:13,589
in a model look like
it's a really interesting concept

2518
00:42:13,589 --> 00:42:13,599
it's a really interesting concept
 

2519
00:42:13,599 --> 00:42:16,230
it's a really interesting concept
fascinating concept what is that is that

2520
00:42:16,230 --> 00:42:16,240
fascinating concept what is that is that
 

2521
00:42:16,240 --> 00:42:17,270
fascinating concept what is that is that
the recursive

2522
00:42:17,270 --> 00:42:17,280
the recursive
 

2523
00:42:17,280 --> 00:42:19,990
the recursive
recursiveness gives you that or how do

2524
00:42:19,990 --> 00:42:20,000
recursiveness gives you that or how do
 

2525
00:42:20,000 --> 00:42:21,109
recursiveness gives you that or how do
you how do you do it um

2526
00:42:21,109 --> 00:42:21,119
you how do you do it um
 

2527
00:42:21,119 --> 00:42:22,950
you how do you do it um
quite a few things it's like what what

2528
00:42:22,950 --> 00:42:22,960
quite a few things it's like what what
 

2529
00:42:22,960 --> 00:42:24,390
quite a few things it's like what what
does the model factor

2530
00:42:24,390 --> 00:42:24,400
does the model factor
 

2531
00:42:24,400 --> 00:42:26,630
does the model factor
or factorize you know what are the what

2532
00:42:26,630 --> 00:42:26,640
or factorize you know what are the what
 

2533
00:42:26,640 --> 00:42:28,309
or factorize you know what are the what
is the model representing us different

2534
00:42:28,309 --> 00:42:28,319
is the model representing us different
 

2535
00:42:28,319 --> 00:42:28,950
is the model representing us different
pieces

2536
00:42:28,950 --> 00:42:28,960
pieces
 

2537
00:42:28,960 --> 00:42:31,270
pieces
in the puzzle like you know so so in the

2538
00:42:31,270 --> 00:42:31,280
in the puzzle like you know so so in the
 

2539
00:42:31,280 --> 00:42:31,990
in the puzzle like you know so so in the
rcn

2540
00:42:31,990 --> 00:42:32,000
rcn
 

2541
00:42:32,000 --> 00:42:34,710
rcn
uh network it it thinks of the world you

2542
00:42:34,710 --> 00:42:34,720
uh network it it thinks of the world you
 

2543
00:42:34,720 --> 00:42:35,030
uh network it it thinks of the world you
know

2544
00:42:35,030 --> 00:42:35,040
know
 

2545
00:42:35,040 --> 00:42:38,309
know
what i say the background of an image

2546
00:42:38,309 --> 00:42:38,319
what i say the background of an image
 

2547
00:42:38,319 --> 00:42:39,670
what i say the background of an image
is modeled separately from the

2548
00:42:39,670 --> 00:42:39,680
is modeled separately from the
 

2549
00:42:39,680 --> 00:42:41,510
is modeled separately from the
foreground of the image

2550
00:42:41,510 --> 00:42:41,520
foreground of the image
 

2551
00:42:41,520 --> 00:42:43,670
foreground of the image
so the objects are separate from the

2552
00:42:43,670 --> 00:42:43,680
so the objects are separate from the
 

2553
00:42:43,680 --> 00:42:45,190
so the objects are separate from the
background they're different entities

2554
00:42:45,190 --> 00:42:45,200
background they're different entities
 

2555
00:42:45,200 --> 00:42:47,030
background they're different entities
so there's a kind of segmentation that's

2556
00:42:47,030 --> 00:42:47,040
so there's a kind of segmentation that's
 

2557
00:42:47,040 --> 00:42:48,870
so there's a kind of segmentation that's
built in fundamentally that's why

2558
00:42:48,870 --> 00:42:48,880
built in fundamentally that's why
 

2559
00:42:48,880 --> 00:42:51,349
built in fundamentally that's why
and and then even that object is

2560
00:42:51,349 --> 00:42:51,359
and and then even that object is
 

2561
00:42:51,359 --> 00:42:52,069
and and then even that object is
composed of

2562
00:42:52,069 --> 00:42:52,079
composed of
 

2563
00:42:52,079 --> 00:42:54,870
composed of
parts and also and another one is the

2564
00:42:54,870 --> 00:42:54,880
parts and also and another one is the
 

2565
00:42:54,880 --> 00:42:56,309
parts and also and another one is the
the shape of the object

2566
00:42:56,309 --> 00:42:56,319
the shape of the object
 

2567
00:42:56,319 --> 00:42:59,589
the shape of the object
uh is differently modeled from the

2568
00:42:59,589 --> 00:42:59,599
uh is differently modeled from the
 

2569
00:42:59,599 --> 00:43:01,990
uh is differently modeled from the
texture of the object

2570
00:43:01,990 --> 00:43:02,000
texture of the object
 

2571
00:43:02,000 --> 00:43:05,190
texture of the object
got it so there's like these um

2572
00:43:05,190 --> 00:43:05,200
got it so there's like these um
 

2573
00:43:05,200 --> 00:43:07,510
got it so there's like these um
i've been you know who francois charles

00:43:12,230 --> 00:43:12,240
yeah he's so there's uh he developed
 

2579
00:43:12,240 --> 00:43:14,069
yeah he's so there's uh he developed
this like iq test type of thing

2580
00:43:14,069 --> 00:43:14,079
this like iq test type of thing
 

2581
00:43:14,079 --> 00:43:17,270
this like iq test type of thing
for arc challenge for and uh it's kind

2582
00:43:17,270 --> 00:43:17,280
for arc challenge for and uh it's kind
 

2583
00:43:17,280 --> 00:43:19,030
for arc challenge for and uh it's kind
of cool that there's um

2584
00:43:19,030 --> 00:43:19,040
of cool that there's um
 

2585
00:43:19,040 --> 00:43:22,230
of cool that there's um
these concepts priors that he defines

2586
00:43:22,230 --> 00:43:22,240
these concepts priors that he defines
 

2587
00:43:22,240 --> 00:43:23,990
these concepts priors that he defines
that you bring to the table

2588
00:43:23,990 --> 00:43:24,000
that you bring to the table
 

2589
00:43:24,000 --> 00:43:25,589
that you bring to the table
in order to be able to reason about

things that you should be
 

2601
00:43:34,319 --> 00:43:36,550

00:43:37,680 --> 00:43:40,870
that you should be able to

00:43:40,870 --> 00:43:40,880
uh model and yes keep in mind that
 

2607
00:43:40,880 --> 00:43:43,270
uh model and yes keep in mind that
you you can derive this from much more

2608
00:43:43,270 --> 00:43:43,280
you you can derive this from much more
 

2609
00:43:43,280 --> 00:43:44,390
you you can derive this from much more
general principles

00:43:44,400 --> 00:43:46,230
general principles
it doesn't you don't need to explicitly

2612
00:43:46,230 --> 00:43:46,240
it doesn't you don't need to explicitly
 

2613
00:43:46,240 --> 00:43:47,510
it doesn't you don't need to explicitly
put it as oh

objects versus foreground versus
 

2617
00:43:49,359 --> 00:43:50,870
objects versus foreground versus

2618
00:43:50,870 --> 00:43:50,880
background uh
 

2619
00:43:50,880 --> 00:43:52,550
background uh
the surface versus structure now these

2620
00:43:52,550 --> 00:43:52,560
the surface versus structure now these
 

2621
00:43:52,560 --> 00:43:54,710
the surface versus structure now these
are these are derivable from

2622
00:43:54,710 --> 00:43:54,720
are these are derivable from
 

2623
00:43:54,720 --> 00:43:57,829
are these are derivable from
more fundamental principles of how

2624
00:43:57,829 --> 00:43:57,839
more fundamental principles of how
 

2625
00:43:57,839 --> 00:43:59,349
more fundamental principles of how
you know what's the property of

2626
00:43:59,349 --> 00:43:59,359
you know what's the property of
 

2627
00:43:59,359 --> 00:44:02,470
you know what's the property of
continuity of natural signals

2628
00:44:02,470 --> 00:44:02,480
continuity of natural signals
 

2629
00:44:02,480 --> 00:44:04,390
continuity of natural signals
what's the property of continuity of

2630
00:44:04,390 --> 00:44:04,400
what's the property of continuity of
 

2631
00:44:04,400 --> 00:44:05,829
what's the property of continuity of
natural signals yeah

2632
00:44:05,829 --> 00:44:05,839
natural signals yeah
 

2633
00:44:05,839 --> 00:44:07,670
natural signals yeah
by the way that sounds very poetic but

2634
00:44:07,670 --> 00:44:07,680
by the way that sounds very poetic but
 

2635
00:44:07,680 --> 00:44:10,870
by the way that sounds very poetic but
yeah uh so you're saying that's a

2636
00:44:10,870 --> 00:44:10,880
yeah uh so you're saying that's a
 

2637
00:44:10,880 --> 00:44:12,870
yeah uh so you're saying that's a
there's some low-level properties from

2638
00:44:12,870 --> 00:44:12,880
there's some low-level properties from
 

2639
00:44:12,880 --> 00:44:14,630
there's some low-level properties from
which emerges the idea that shapes

2640
00:44:14,630 --> 00:44:14,640
which emerges the idea that shapes
 

2641
00:44:14,640 --> 00:44:16,390
which emerges the idea that shapes
should be different than

2642
00:44:16,390 --> 00:44:16,400
should be different than
 

2643
00:44:16,400 --> 00:44:18,150
should be different than
like uh there should be a parts of an

2644
00:44:18,150 --> 00:44:18,160
like uh there should be a parts of an
 

2645
00:44:18,160 --> 00:44:19,430
like uh there should be a parts of an
object there should be

2646
00:44:19,430 --> 00:44:19,440
object there should be
 

2647
00:44:19,440 --> 00:44:20,950
object there should be
i mean exactly kind of like friends of

2648
00:44:20,950 --> 00:44:20,960
i mean exactly kind of like friends of
 

2649
00:44:20,960 --> 00:44:23,349
i mean exactly kind of like friends of
water i mean there's objectness

2650
00:44:23,349 --> 00:44:23,359
water i mean there's objectness
 

2651
00:44:23,359 --> 00:44:25,270
water i mean there's objectness
there's all these things that it's kind

2652
00:44:25,270 --> 00:44:25,280
there's all these things that it's kind
 

2653
00:44:25,280 --> 00:44:27,510
there's all these things that it's kind
of crazy that we're humans

2654
00:44:27,510 --> 00:44:27,520
of crazy that we're humans
 

2655
00:44:27,520 --> 00:44:29,990
of crazy that we're humans
uh i guess evolved to have because it's

2656
00:44:29,990 --> 00:44:30,000
uh i guess evolved to have because it's
 

2657
00:44:30,000 --> 00:44:31,750
uh i guess evolved to have because it's
useful for us to perceive the world

2658
00:44:31,750 --> 00:44:31,760
useful for us to perceive the world
 

2659
00:44:31,760 --> 00:44:33,190
useful for us to perceive the world
correct yeah correct and it

2660
00:44:33,190 --> 00:44:33,200
correct yeah correct and it
 

2661
00:44:33,200 --> 00:44:35,430
correct yeah correct and it
derives mostly from the properties of

2662
00:44:35,430 --> 00:44:35,440
derives mostly from the properties of
 

2663
00:44:35,440 --> 00:44:36,309
derives mostly from the properties of
natural signals

2664
00:44:36,309 --> 00:44:36,319
natural signals
 

2665
00:44:36,319 --> 00:44:39,589
natural signals
and yeah and so um natural

2666
00:44:39,589 --> 00:44:39,599
and yeah and so um natural
 

2667
00:44:39,599 --> 00:44:41,990
and yeah and so um natural
signals so natural signals are the kind

2668
00:44:41,990 --> 00:44:42,000
signals so natural signals are the kind
 

2669
00:44:42,000 --> 00:44:43,589
signals so natural signals are the kind
of things we'll perceive in the

2670
00:44:43,589 --> 00:44:43,599
of things we'll perceive in the
 

2671
00:44:43,599 --> 00:44:45,589
of things we'll perceive in the
in the natural world i don't know i

2672
00:44:45,589 --> 00:44:45,599
in the natural world i don't know i
 

2673
00:44:45,599 --> 00:44:47,030
in the natural world i don't know i
don't i don't know why that sounds so

2674
00:44:47,030 --> 00:44:47,040
don't i don't know why that sounds so
 

2675
00:44:47,040 --> 00:44:48,790
don't i don't know why that sounds so
beautiful natural signals yeah as

2676
00:44:48,790 --> 00:44:48,800
beautiful natural signals yeah as
 

2677
00:44:48,800 --> 00:44:50,230
beautiful natural signals yeah as
opposed to a qr code

2678
00:44:50,230 --> 00:44:50,240
opposed to a qr code
 

2679
00:44:50,240 --> 00:44:51,750
opposed to a qr code
right which is an artificial signal that

2680
00:44:51,750 --> 00:44:51,760
right which is an artificial signal that
 

2681
00:44:51,760 --> 00:44:54,309
right which is an artificial signal that
we created humans are not very good at

2682
00:44:54,309 --> 00:44:54,319
we created humans are not very good at
 

2683
00:44:54,319 --> 00:44:56,230
we created humans are not very good at
classifying qr codes we are very good at

2684
00:44:56,230 --> 00:44:56,240
classifying qr codes we are very good at
 

2685
00:44:56,240 --> 00:44:58,309
classifying qr codes we are very good at
saying something is a cat or a dog

2686
00:44:58,309 --> 00:44:58,319
saying something is a cat or a dog
 

2687
00:44:58,319 --> 00:45:00,069
saying something is a cat or a dog
but not very good at you know the

2688
00:45:00,069 --> 00:45:00,079
but not very good at you know the
 

2689
00:45:00,079 --> 00:45:01,829
but not very good at you know the
classification computers are very good

2690
00:45:01,829 --> 00:45:01,839
classification computers are very good
 

2691
00:45:01,839 --> 00:45:04,870
classification computers are very good
at classifying qr codes so our visual

2692
00:45:04,870 --> 00:45:04,880
at classifying qr codes so our visual
 

2693
00:45:04,880 --> 00:45:06,790
at classifying qr codes so our visual
system is tuned for

00:45:06,790 --> 00:45:06,800
system is tuned for
 

2695
00:45:06,800 --> 00:45:08,790
system is tuned for
natural signals and there are

2696
00:45:08,790 --> 00:45:08,800
natural signals and there are
 

2697
00:45:08,800 --> 00:45:09,910
natural signals and there are
fundamental assumptions

2698
00:45:09,910 --> 00:45:09,920
fundamental assumptions
 

2699
00:45:09,920 --> 00:45:12,230
fundamental assumptions
in the architecture that are derived

00:45:12,230 --> 00:45:12,240
in the architecture that are derived
 

2701
00:45:12,240 --> 00:45:14,150
in the architecture that are derived
from natural signals

2702
00:45:14,150 --> 00:45:14,160
from natural signals
 

2703
00:45:14,160 --> 00:45:16,870
from natural signals
properties i wonder when you take a

2704
00:45:16,870 --> 00:45:16,880
properties i wonder when you take a
 

2705
00:45:16,880 --> 00:45:18,230
properties i wonder when you take a
hallucinogenic drugs

2706
00:45:18,230 --> 00:45:18,240
hallucinogenic drugs
 

2707
00:45:18,240 --> 00:45:20,950
hallucinogenic drugs
does that go into natural or is that

2708
00:45:20,950 --> 00:45:20,960
does that go into natural or is that
 

2709
00:45:20,960 --> 00:45:23,829
does that go into natural or is that
closer to the qr code

2710
00:45:23,829 --> 00:45:23,839
closer to the qr code
 

2711
00:45:23,839 --> 00:45:25,750
closer to the qr code
it's still natural yeah because it's it

2712
00:45:25,750 --> 00:45:25,760
it's still natural yeah because it's it
 

2713
00:45:25,760 --> 00:45:27,030
it's still natural yeah because it's it
is still operating

2714
00:45:27,030 --> 00:45:27,040
is still operating
 

2715
00:45:27,040 --> 00:45:28,870
is still operating
using your brains by the way on that on

2716
00:45:28,870 --> 00:45:28,880
using your brains by the way on that on
 

2717
00:45:28,880 --> 00:45:30,710
using your brains by the way on that on
that topic i i mean i haven't been

2718
00:45:30,710 --> 00:45:30,720
that topic i i mean i haven't been
 

2719
00:45:30,720 --> 00:45:32,230
that topic i i mean i haven't been
following i think they're becoming

2720
00:45:32,230 --> 00:45:32,240
following i think they're becoming
 

2721
00:45:32,240 --> 00:45:34,150
following i think they're becoming
legalized at certain i can't wait

2722
00:45:34,150 --> 00:45:34,160
legalized at certain i can't wait
 

2723
00:45:34,160 --> 00:45:35,990
legalized at certain i can't wait
until they become legalized to the

2724
00:45:35,990 --> 00:45:36,000
until they become legalized to the
 

2725
00:45:36,000 --> 00:45:37,270
until they become legalized to the
degree that you

2726
00:45:37,270 --> 00:45:37,280
degree that you
 

2727
00:45:37,280 --> 00:45:39,670
degree that you
like vision science futures could study

2728
00:45:39,670 --> 00:45:39,680
like vision science futures could study
 

2729
00:45:39,680 --> 00:45:40,470
like vision science futures could study
it yeah

2730
00:45:40,470 --> 00:45:40,480
it yeah
 

2731
00:45:40,480 --> 00:45:43,589
it yeah
just like through through medical

2732
00:45:43,589 --> 00:45:43,599
just like through through medical
 

2733
00:45:43,599 --> 00:45:46,150
just like through through medical
chemical ways modify there could be

2734
00:45:46,150 --> 00:45:46,160
chemical ways modify there could be
 

2735
00:45:46,160 --> 00:45:47,589
chemical ways modify there could be
ethical concerns but

2736
00:45:47,589 --> 00:45:47,599
ethical concerns but
 

2737
00:45:47,599 --> 00:45:49,430
ethical concerns but
modif that's another way to study the

2738
00:45:49,430 --> 00:45:49,440
modif that's another way to study the
 

2739
00:45:49,440 --> 00:45:50,870
modif that's another way to study the
brain is to be

2740
00:45:50,870 --> 00:45:50,880
brain is to be
 

2741
00:45:50,880 --> 00:45:53,270
brain is to be
be able to chemically modify it there's

2742
00:45:53,270 --> 00:45:53,280
be able to chemically modify it there's
 

2743
00:45:53,280 --> 00:45:53,910
be able to chemically modify it there's
probably

2744
00:45:53,910 --> 00:45:53,920
probably
 

2745
00:45:53,920 --> 00:45:57,589
probably
um probably very long a way to figure

2746
00:45:57,589 --> 00:45:57,599
um probably very long a way to figure
 

2747
00:45:57,599 --> 00:45:59,109
um probably very long a way to figure
out how to do it ethically

2748
00:45:59,109 --> 00:45:59,119
out how to do it ethically
 

2749
00:45:59,119 --> 00:46:01,270
out how to do it ethically
yeah but i i think there are studies on

2750
00:46:01,270 --> 00:46:01,280
yeah but i i think there are studies on
 

2751
00:46:01,280 --> 00:46:02,870
yeah but i i think there are studies on
that already

2752
00:46:02,870 --> 00:46:02,880
that already
 

2753
00:46:02,880 --> 00:46:05,109
that already
yeah i think so uh because it's not

2754
00:46:05,109 --> 00:46:05,119
yeah i think so uh because it's not
 

2755
00:46:05,119 --> 00:46:06,069
yeah i think so uh because it's not
unethical to give

2756
00:46:06,069 --> 00:46:06,079
unethical to give
 

2757
00:46:06,079 --> 00:46:09,470
unethical to give
uh it to rats oh that's true that's true

2758
00:46:09,470 --> 00:46:09,480
uh it to rats oh that's true that's true
 

2759
00:46:09,480 --> 00:46:11,990
uh it to rats oh that's true that's true
[Laughter]

2760
00:46:11,990 --> 00:46:12,000
[Laughter]
 

2761
00:46:12,000 --> 00:46:14,069
[Laughter]
there's a lot of drugged up rats out

2762
00:46:14,069 --> 00:46:14,079
there's a lot of drugged up rats out
 

2763
00:46:14,079 --> 00:46:15,190
there's a lot of drugged up rats out
there okay yeah cool

2764
00:46:15,190 --> 00:46:15,200
there okay yeah cool
 

2765
00:46:15,200 --> 00:46:18,230
there okay yeah cool
sorry sorry so okay so there's uh so

2766
00:46:18,230 --> 00:46:18,240
sorry sorry so okay so there's uh so
 

2767
00:46:18,240 --> 00:46:19,349
sorry sorry so okay so there's uh so
there's these

2768
00:46:19,349 --> 00:46:19,359
there's these
 

2769
00:46:19,359 --> 00:46:22,390
there's these
uh low-level uh

2770
00:46:22,390 --> 00:46:22,400
uh low-level uh
 

2771
00:46:22,400 --> 00:46:25,190
uh low-level uh
things from natural signals that uh that

2772
00:46:25,190 --> 00:46:25,200
things from natural signals that uh that
 

2773
00:46:25,200 --> 00:46:26,550
things from natural signals that uh that
that

2774
00:46:26,550 --> 00:46:26,560
that
 

2775
00:46:26,560 --> 00:46:28,550
that
from which these properties will emerge

2776
00:46:28,550 --> 00:46:28,560
from which these properties will emerge
 

2777
00:46:28,560 --> 00:46:31,109
from which these properties will emerge
yes uh but it is still

2778
00:46:31,109 --> 00:46:31,119
yes uh but it is still
 

2779
00:46:31,119 --> 00:46:33,910
yes uh but it is still
a very hard problem on how to encode

2780
00:46:33,910 --> 00:46:33,920
a very hard problem on how to encode
 

2781
00:46:33,920 --> 00:46:35,030
a very hard problem on how to encode
that again so you don't

2782
00:46:35,030 --> 00:46:35,040
that again so you don't
 

2783
00:46:35,040 --> 00:46:37,510
that again so you don't
you know there is no uh so uh you

2784
00:46:37,510 --> 00:46:37,520
you know there is no uh so uh you
 

2785
00:46:37,520 --> 00:46:38,230
you know there is no uh so uh you
mentioned

2786
00:46:38,230 --> 00:46:38,240
mentioned
 

2787
00:46:38,240 --> 00:46:41,510
mentioned
um the the the priors uh francho wanted

2788
00:46:41,510 --> 00:46:41,520
um the the the priors uh francho wanted
 

2789
00:46:41,520 --> 00:46:42,550
um the the the priors uh francho wanted
to encode in

2790
00:46:42,550 --> 00:46:42,560
to encode in
 

2791
00:46:42,560 --> 00:46:44,950
to encode in
uh in the abstract reasoning challenge

2792
00:46:44,950 --> 00:46:44,960
uh in the abstract reasoning challenge
 

2793
00:46:44,960 --> 00:46:46,950
uh in the abstract reasoning challenge
but it is not straightforward how to

2794
00:46:46,950 --> 00:46:46,960
but it is not straightforward how to
 

2795
00:46:46,960 --> 00:46:48,309
but it is not straightforward how to
encode those priors

2796
00:46:48,309 --> 00:46:48,319
encode those priors
 

2797
00:46:48,319 --> 00:46:51,030
encode those priors
um so so some of those uh challenges

2798
00:46:51,030 --> 00:46:51,040
um so so some of those uh challenges
 

2799
00:46:51,040 --> 00:46:51,589
um so so some of those uh challenges
like you know

2800
00:46:51,589 --> 00:46:51,599
like you know
 

2801
00:46:51,599 --> 00:46:54,630
like you know
the object completion challenges are

2802
00:46:54,630 --> 00:46:54,640
the object completion challenges are
 

2803
00:46:54,640 --> 00:46:56,550
the object completion challenges are
things that we purely use our visual

2804
00:46:56,550 --> 00:46:56,560
things that we purely use our visual
 

2805
00:46:56,560 --> 00:46:58,230
things that we purely use our visual
system to do it is uh it

00:46:58,230 --> 00:46:58,240
system to do it is uh it
 

2807
00:46:58,240 --> 00:46:59,750
system to do it is uh it
looks like abstract reasoning but it is

2808
00:46:59,750 --> 00:46:59,760
looks like abstract reasoning but it is
 

2809
00:46:59,760 --> 00:47:01,349
looks like abstract reasoning but it is
purely an output of

there is no abstract reasoning involved
 

2823
00:47:11,040 --> 00:47:13,510
there is no abstract reasoning involved
it it uses all these priors but it is

2824
00:47:13,510 --> 00:47:13,520
it it uses all these priors but it is
 

2825
00:47:13,520 --> 00:47:14,390
it it uses all these priors but it is

that is amenable to inference
 

2831
00:47:19,839 --> 00:47:22,150
that is amenable to inference
and and and that is one of the things

2832
00:47:22,150 --> 00:47:22,160
and and and that is one of the things
 

2833
00:47:22,160 --> 00:47:24,069

00:47:24,069 --> 00:47:24,079
that we tackled in the you know so
 

2835
00:47:24,079 --> 00:47:25,510
that we tackled in the you know so
basically saying okay these are the

2836
00:47:25,510 --> 00:47:25,520
basically saying okay these are the
 

2837
00:47:25,520 --> 00:47:26,390
basically saying okay these are the
prior knowledge

2838
00:47:26,390 --> 00:47:26,400
prior knowledge
 

2839
00:47:26,400 --> 00:47:28,790
prior knowledge
uh which which will be derived from the

00:47:28,790 --> 00:47:28,800
uh which which will be derived from the
 

2841
00:47:28,800 --> 00:47:29,990
uh which which will be derived from the
world but then

2842
00:47:29,990 --> 00:47:30,000
world but then
 

2843
00:47:30,000 --> 00:47:32,390
world but then
how is that prior knowledge represented

2844
00:47:32,390 --> 00:47:32,400
how is that prior knowledge represented
 

2845
00:47:32,400 --> 00:47:33,270
how is that prior knowledge represented
in the model

2846
00:47:33,270 --> 00:47:33,280
in the model
 

2847
00:47:33,280 --> 00:47:36,069
in the model
such that inference when when some piece

2848
00:47:36,069 --> 00:47:36,079
such that inference when when some piece
 

2849
00:47:36,079 --> 00:47:37,270
such that inference when when some piece
of evidence comes in

00:47:37,270 --> 00:47:37,280
of evidence comes in
 

2851
00:47:37,280 --> 00:47:39,750
of evidence comes in
can be done very efficiently and in a

2852
00:47:39,750 --> 00:47:39,760
can be done very efficiently and in a
 

2853
00:47:39,760 --> 00:47:41,349
can be done very efficiently and in a
very distributed way

2854
00:47:41,349 --> 00:47:41,359
very distributed way
 

2855
00:47:41,359 --> 00:47:43,750
very distributed way
um because it is very there are so many

2856
00:47:43,750 --> 00:47:43,760
um because it is very there are so many
 

2857
00:47:43,760 --> 00:47:45,349
um because it is very there are so many
ways of representing knowledge

2858
00:47:45,349 --> 00:47:45,359
ways of representing knowledge
 

2859
00:47:45,359 --> 00:47:48,309
ways of representing knowledge
which is not amenable to very quick

2860
00:47:48,309 --> 00:47:48,319
which is not amenable to very quick
 

2861
00:47:48,319 --> 00:47:49,030
which is not amenable to very quick
inference

2862
00:47:49,030 --> 00:47:49,040
inference
 

2863
00:47:49,040 --> 00:47:52,069
inference
in a quick lookups and so that's one

2864
00:47:52,069 --> 00:47:52,079
in a quick lookups and so that's one
 

2865
00:47:52,079 --> 00:47:55,190
in a quick lookups and so that's one
um core part of what we tackled

2866
00:47:55,190 --> 00:47:55,200
um core part of what we tackled
 

2867
00:47:55,200 --> 00:47:58,790
um core part of what we tackled
in uh the rcn model um uh how do you

2868
00:47:58,790 --> 00:47:58,800
in uh the rcn model um uh how do you
 

2869
00:47:58,800 --> 00:48:00,630
in uh the rcn model um uh how do you
encode visual knowledge to uh

2870
00:48:00,630 --> 00:48:00,640
encode visual knowledge to uh
 

2871
00:48:00,640 --> 00:48:03,109
encode visual knowledge to uh
do very quick inference and yeah can you

2872
00:48:03,109 --> 00:48:03,119
do very quick inference and yeah can you
 

2873
00:48:03,119 --> 00:48:04,470
do very quick inference and yeah can you
maybe comment on uh

2874
00:48:04,470 --> 00:48:04,480
maybe comment on uh
 

2875
00:48:04,480 --> 00:48:07,030
maybe comment on uh
so folks listening to this in general

2876
00:48:07,030 --> 00:48:07,040
so folks listening to this in general
 

2877
00:48:07,040 --> 00:48:08,630
so folks listening to this in general
may be familiar with

2878
00:48:08,630 --> 00:48:08,640
may be familiar with
 

2879
00:48:08,640 --> 00:48:09,990
may be familiar with
different kinds of architectures of

2880
00:48:09,990 --> 00:48:10,000
different kinds of architectures of
 

2881
00:48:10,000 --> 00:48:12,150
different kinds of architectures of
neural networks

2882
00:48:12,150 --> 00:48:12,160
neural networks
 

2883
00:48:12,160 --> 00:48:14,549
neural networks
what what are we talking about with rcn

2884
00:48:14,549 --> 00:48:14,559
what what are we talking about with rcn
 

2885
00:48:14,559 --> 00:48:15,349
what what are we talking about with rcn
uh

2886
00:48:15,349 --> 00:48:15,359
uh
 

2887
00:48:15,359 --> 00:48:16,950
uh
what are what does the architecture look

2888
00:48:16,950 --> 00:48:16,960
what are what does the architecture look
 

2889
00:48:16,960 --> 00:48:18,790
what are what does the architecture look
like what are different components

2890
00:48:18,790 --> 00:48:18,800
like what are different components
 

2891
00:48:18,800 --> 00:48:20,390
like what are different components
is it close to neural networks is it far

2892
00:48:20,390 --> 00:48:20,400
is it close to neural networks is it far
 

2893
00:48:20,400 --> 00:48:22,150
is it close to neural networks is it far
away from neural networks what does it

2894
00:48:22,150 --> 00:48:22,160
away from neural networks what does it
 

2895
00:48:22,160 --> 00:48:22,630
away from neural networks what does it
look like

2896
00:48:22,630 --> 00:48:22,640
look like
 

2897
00:48:22,640 --> 00:48:26,150
look like
yeah so so you can uh think of the delta

2898
00:48:26,150 --> 00:48:26,160
yeah so so you can uh think of the delta
 

2899
00:48:26,160 --> 00:48:27,109
yeah so so you can uh think of the delta
between the model

2900
00:48:27,109 --> 00:48:27,119
between the model
 

2901
00:48:27,119 --> 00:48:29,030
between the model
and a convolutional neural network if

2902
00:48:29,030 --> 00:48:29,040
and a convolutional neural network if
 

2903
00:48:29,040 --> 00:48:30,549
and a convolutional neural network if
people are familiar with convolutional

2904
00:48:30,549 --> 00:48:30,559
people are familiar with convolutional
 

2905
00:48:30,559 --> 00:48:31,430
people are familiar with convolutional
neural networks

2906
00:48:31,430 --> 00:48:31,440
neural networks
 

2907
00:48:31,440 --> 00:48:33,030
neural networks
so convolutional neural networks have

2908
00:48:33,030 --> 00:48:33,040
so convolutional neural networks have
 

2909
00:48:33,040 --> 00:48:35,190
so convolutional neural networks have
this feed-forward processing cascade

2910
00:48:35,190 --> 00:48:35,200
this feed-forward processing cascade
 

2911
00:48:35,200 --> 00:48:36,309
this feed-forward processing cascade
which is called

2912
00:48:36,309 --> 00:48:36,319
which is called
 

2913
00:48:36,319 --> 00:48:38,710
which is called
uh feature detectors and pooling and

2914
00:48:38,710 --> 00:48:38,720
uh feature detectors and pooling and
 

2915
00:48:38,720 --> 00:48:40,630
uh feature detectors and pooling and
that is repeated in the in the hierarchy

2916
00:48:40,630 --> 00:48:40,640
that is repeated in the in the hierarchy
 

2917
00:48:40,640 --> 00:48:41,510
that is repeated in the in the hierarchy
in a

2918
00:48:41,510 --> 00:48:41,520
in a
 

2919
00:48:41,520 --> 00:48:44,870
in a
multi-level uh system um and if you

2920
00:48:44,870 --> 00:48:44,880
multi-level uh system um and if you
 

2921
00:48:44,880 --> 00:48:47,030
multi-level uh system um and if you
if you want an intuitive idea of what

2922
00:48:47,030 --> 00:48:47,040
if you want an intuitive idea of what
 

2923
00:48:47,040 --> 00:48:49,510
if you want an intuitive idea of what
what is happening feature detectors are

2924
00:48:49,510 --> 00:48:49,520
what is happening feature detectors are
 

2925
00:48:49,520 --> 00:48:52,390
what is happening feature detectors are
uh you know detecting interesting

2926
00:48:52,390 --> 00:48:52,400
uh you know detecting interesting
 

2927
00:48:52,400 --> 00:48:53,270
uh you know detecting interesting
co-occurrences

2928
00:48:53,270 --> 00:48:53,280
co-occurrences
 

2929
00:48:53,280 --> 00:48:56,630
co-occurrences
in the input it can be a line a corner

2930
00:48:56,630 --> 00:48:56,640
in the input it can be a line a corner
 

2931
00:48:56,640 --> 00:48:59,910
in the input it can be a line a corner
a an eye or a piece of texture

2932
00:48:59,910 --> 00:48:59,920
a an eye or a piece of texture
 

2933
00:48:59,920 --> 00:49:03,829
a an eye or a piece of texture
etc and the pooling neurons are

2934
00:49:03,829 --> 00:49:03,839
etc and the pooling neurons are
 

2935
00:49:03,839 --> 00:49:06,230
etc and the pooling neurons are
doing some local transformation of that

2936
00:49:06,230 --> 00:49:06,240
doing some local transformation of that
 

2937
00:49:06,240 --> 00:49:07,750
doing some local transformation of that
and making it invariant to local

2938
00:49:07,750 --> 00:49:07,760
and making it invariant to local
 

2939
00:49:07,760 --> 00:49:09,349
and making it invariant to local
transformations so this is what the

2940
00:49:09,349 --> 00:49:09,359
transformations so this is what the
 

2941
00:49:09,359 --> 00:49:10,549
transformations so this is what the
structure of convolutional neural

2942
00:49:10,549 --> 00:49:10,559
structure of convolutional neural
 

2943
00:49:10,559 --> 00:49:11,750
structure of convolutional neural
network is

2944
00:49:11,750 --> 00:49:11,760
network is
 

2945
00:49:11,760 --> 00:49:14,870
network is
um recursive cortical network

2946
00:49:14,870 --> 00:49:14,880
um recursive cortical network
 

2947
00:49:14,880 --> 00:49:16,950
um recursive cortical network
has a similar structure when you look at

2948
00:49:16,950 --> 00:49:16,960
has a similar structure when you look at
 

2949
00:49:16,960 --> 00:49:18,710
has a similar structure when you look at
just the feed forward pathway

2950
00:49:18,710 --> 00:49:18,720
just the feed forward pathway
 

2951
00:49:18,720 --> 00:49:20,710
just the feed forward pathway
but in addition to that it is also

2952
00:49:20,710 --> 00:49:20,720
but in addition to that it is also
 

2953
00:49:20,720 --> 00:49:21,910
but in addition to that it is also
structured in a way that it is

2954
00:49:21,910 --> 00:49:21,920
structured in a way that it is
 

2955
00:49:21,920 --> 00:49:23,670
structured in a way that it is
generating

2956
00:49:23,670 --> 00:49:23,680
generating
 

2957
00:49:23,680 --> 00:49:25,829
generating
so that again it can run it backward and

2958
00:49:25,829 --> 00:49:25,839
so that again it can run it backward and
 

2959
00:49:25,839 --> 00:49:28,390
so that again it can run it backward and
combine the forward with the backward

2960
00:49:28,390 --> 00:49:28,400
combine the forward with the backward
 

2961
00:49:28,400 --> 00:49:31,510
combine the forward with the backward
another aspect that it has is

2962
00:49:31,510 --> 00:49:31,520
another aspect that it has is
 

2963
00:49:31,520 --> 00:49:34,549
another aspect that it has is
it has lateral connections these

2964
00:49:34,549 --> 00:49:34,559
it has lateral connections these
 

2965
00:49:34,559 --> 00:49:37,589
it has lateral connections these
lateral connections um which is between

2966
00:49:37,589 --> 00:49:37,599
lateral connections um which is between
 

2967
00:49:37,599 --> 00:49:39,430
lateral connections um which is between
so if you have an edge here and an edge

2968
00:49:39,430 --> 00:49:39,440
so if you have an edge here and an edge
 

2969
00:49:39,440 --> 00:49:40,069
so if you have an edge here and an edge
here

2970
00:49:40,069 --> 00:49:40,079
here
 

2971
00:49:40,079 --> 00:49:41,910
here
it has connections between these edges

2972
00:49:41,910 --> 00:49:41,920
it has connections between these edges
 

2973
00:49:41,920 --> 00:49:43,670
it has connections between these edges
it is not just feed forward connections

2974
00:49:43,670 --> 00:49:43,680
it is not just feed forward connections
 

2975
00:49:43,680 --> 00:49:47,270
it is not just feed forward connections
it is um something between these edges

2976
00:49:47,270 --> 00:49:47,280
it is um something between these edges
 

2977
00:49:47,280 --> 00:49:49,510
it is um something between these edges
which is the nodes are presenting these

2978
00:49:49,510 --> 00:49:49,520
which is the nodes are presenting these
 

2979
00:49:49,520 --> 00:49:51,829
which is the nodes are presenting these
edges which is to enforce compatibility

2980
00:49:51,829 --> 00:49:51,839
edges which is to enforce compatibility
 

2981
00:49:51,839 --> 00:49:52,870
edges which is to enforce compatibility
between them

2982
00:49:52,870 --> 00:49:52,880
between them
 

2983
00:49:52,880 --> 00:49:54,230
between them
so otherwise what will happen is the

2984
00:49:54,230 --> 00:49:54,240
so otherwise what will happen is the
 

2985
00:49:54,240 --> 00:49:56,150
so otherwise what will happen is the
constraints it's a constraint it's

2986
00:49:56,150 --> 00:49:56,160
constraints it's a constraint it's
 

2987
00:49:56,160 --> 00:49:56,790
constraints it's a constraint it's
basically

2988
00:49:56,790 --> 00:49:56,800
basically
 

2989
00:49:56,800 --> 00:49:59,510
basically
if you if you do just feature detection

2990
00:49:59,510 --> 00:49:59,520
if you if you do just feature detection
 

2991
00:49:59,520 --> 00:50:01,270
if you if you do just feature detection
followed by pooling

2992
00:50:01,270 --> 00:50:01,280
followed by pooling
 

2993
00:50:01,280 --> 00:50:03,829
followed by pooling
then your your transformations in

2994
00:50:03,829 --> 00:50:03,839
then your your transformations in
 

2995
00:50:03,839 --> 00:50:05,190
then your your transformations in
different parts of the visual field are

2996
00:50:05,190 --> 00:50:05,200
different parts of the visual field are
 

2997
00:50:05,200 --> 00:50:06,790
different parts of the visual field are
not coordinated

2998
00:50:06,790 --> 00:50:06,800
not coordinated
 

2999
00:50:06,800 --> 00:50:09,750
not coordinated
uh and so you can you will create a

3000
00:50:09,750 --> 00:50:09,760
uh and so you can you will create a
 

3001
00:50:09,760 --> 00:50:10,470
uh and so you can you will create a
jagged

3002
00:50:10,470 --> 00:50:10,480
jagged
 

3003
00:50:10,480 --> 00:50:11,670
jagged
when you when you generate from the

3004
00:50:11,670 --> 00:50:11,680
when you when you generate from the
 

3005
00:50:11,680 --> 00:50:14,309
when you when you generate from the
model you will create jagged um

3006
00:50:14,309 --> 00:50:14,319
model you will create jagged um
 

3007
00:50:14,319 --> 00:50:17,349
model you will create jagged um
things and uncoordinated transformations

3008
00:50:17,349 --> 00:50:17,359
things and uncoordinated transformations
 

3009
00:50:17,359 --> 00:50:19,430
things and uncoordinated transformations
so these lateral connections are

3010
00:50:19,430 --> 00:50:19,440
so these lateral connections are
 

3011
00:50:19,440 --> 00:50:20,630
so these lateral connections are
enforcing

3012
00:50:20,630 --> 00:50:20,640
enforcing
 

3013
00:50:20,640 --> 00:50:22,309
enforcing
the the transformations is the whole

3014
00:50:22,309 --> 00:50:22,319
the the transformations is the whole
 

3015
00:50:22,319 --> 00:50:24,390
the the transformations is the whole
thing still differentiable

3016
00:50:24,390 --> 00:50:24,400
thing still differentiable
 

3017
00:50:24,400 --> 00:50:27,589
thing still differentiable
uh no okay no it's not it's not

3018
00:50:27,589 --> 00:50:27,599
uh no okay no it's not it's not
 

3019
00:50:27,599 --> 00:50:30,630
uh no okay no it's not it's not
trade using uh backprop okay that's

3020
00:50:30,630 --> 00:50:30,640
trade using uh backprop okay that's
 

3021
00:50:30,640 --> 00:50:31,829
trade using uh backprop okay that's
really important so

3022
00:50:31,829 --> 00:50:31,839
really important so
 

3023
00:50:31,839 --> 00:50:34,069
really important so
uh so there's this feed forward there's

3024
00:50:34,069 --> 00:50:34,079
uh so there's this feed forward there's
 

3025
00:50:34,079 --> 00:50:35,829
uh so there's this feed forward there's
feedback mechanisms

3026
00:50:35,829 --> 00:50:35,839
feedback mechanisms
 

3027
00:50:35,839 --> 00:50:37,430
feedback mechanisms
there's some interesting connectivity

3028
00:50:37,430 --> 00:50:37,440
there's some interesting connectivity
 

3029
00:50:37,440 --> 00:50:38,870
there's some interesting connectivity
things it's still layered

3030
00:50:38,870 --> 00:50:38,880
things it's still layered
 

3031
00:50:38,880 --> 00:50:41,349
things it's still layered
like uh yes there are multiple levels

3032
00:50:41,349 --> 00:50:41,359
like uh yes there are multiple levels
 

3033
00:50:41,359 --> 00:50:42,790
like uh yes there are multiple levels
multiple

3034
00:50:42,790 --> 00:50:42,800
multiple
 

3035
00:50:42,800 --> 00:50:45,910
multiple
layers okay very very interesting uh and

3036
00:50:45,910 --> 00:50:45,920
layers okay very very interesting uh and
 

3037
00:50:45,920 --> 00:50:48,470
layers okay very very interesting uh and
yeah okay so the interconnection between

3038
00:50:48,470 --> 00:50:48,480
yeah okay so the interconnection between
 

3039
00:50:48,480 --> 00:50:51,349
yeah okay so the interconnection between
um adjacent the connections across

3040
00:50:51,349 --> 00:50:51,359
um adjacent the connections across
 

3041
00:50:51,359 --> 00:50:52,950
um adjacent the connections across
service constraints

3042
00:50:52,950 --> 00:50:52,960
service constraints
 

3043
00:50:52,960 --> 00:50:56,390
service constraints
that like keep the thing stable got it

3044
00:50:56,390 --> 00:50:56,400
that like keep the thing stable got it
 

3045
00:50:56,400 --> 00:50:59,270
that like keep the thing stable got it
okay so what else uh and then there is

3046
00:50:59,270 --> 00:50:59,280
okay so what else uh and then there is
 

3047
00:50:59,280 --> 00:51:00,069
okay so what else uh and then there is
this idea of

3048
00:51:00,069 --> 00:51:00,079
this idea of
 

3049
00:51:00,079 --> 00:51:02,470
this idea of
doing inference a neural network does

3050
00:51:02,470 --> 00:51:02,480
doing inference a neural network does
 

3051
00:51:02,480 --> 00:51:03,510
doing inference a neural network does
not do

3052
00:51:03,510 --> 00:51:03,520
not do
 

3053
00:51:03,520 --> 00:51:06,870
not do
inference on the fly so an example of

3054
00:51:06,870 --> 00:51:06,880
inference on the fly so an example of
 

3055
00:51:06,880 --> 00:51:07,270
inference on the fly so an example of
why

3056
00:51:07,270 --> 00:51:07,280
why
 

3057
00:51:07,280 --> 00:51:09,109
why
this inference is important is you know

3058
00:51:09,109 --> 00:51:09,119
this inference is important is you know
 

3059
00:51:09,119 --> 00:51:11,430
this inference is important is you know
so one of the first applications

3060
00:51:11,430 --> 00:51:11,440
so one of the first applications
 

3061
00:51:11,440 --> 00:51:14,710
so one of the first applications
of that we showed in the paper was to

3062
00:51:14,710 --> 00:51:14,720
of that we showed in the paper was to
 

3063
00:51:14,720 --> 00:51:17,750
of that we showed in the paper was to
crack uh text-based captchas what are

3064
00:51:17,750 --> 00:51:17,760
crack uh text-based captchas what are
 

3065
00:51:17,760 --> 00:51:20,470
crack uh text-based captchas what are
captures by the way

3066
00:51:20,470 --> 00:51:20,480
captures by the way
 

3067
00:51:20,480 --> 00:51:22,549
captures by the way
by the way one of the most awesome like

3068
00:51:22,549 --> 00:51:22,559
by the way one of the most awesome like
 

3069
00:51:22,559 --> 00:51:23,990
by the way one of the most awesome like
the people don't use this term anymore

3070
00:51:23,990 --> 00:51:24,000
the people don't use this term anymore
 

3071
00:51:24,000 --> 00:51:26,390
the people don't use this term anymore
is human computation i think

3072
00:51:26,390 --> 00:51:26,400
is human computation i think
 

3073
00:51:26,400 --> 00:51:28,870
is human computation i think
uh i love this term the guy who created

3074
00:51:28,870 --> 00:51:28,880
uh i love this term the guy who created
 

3075
00:51:28,880 --> 00:51:29,510
uh i love this term the guy who created
captures

3076
00:51:29,510 --> 00:51:29,520
captures
 

3077
00:51:29,520 --> 00:51:31,270
captures
i think came up with this term yeah i

3078
00:51:31,270 --> 00:51:31,280
i think came up with this term yeah i
 

3079
00:51:31,280 --> 00:51:32,870
i think came up with this term yeah i
love it anyway uh

3080
00:51:32,870 --> 00:51:32,880
love it anyway uh
 

3081
00:51:32,880 --> 00:51:35,910
love it anyway uh
yeah uh what what are captures so

3082
00:51:35,910 --> 00:51:35,920
yeah uh what what are captures so
 

3083
00:51:35,920 --> 00:51:36,710
yeah uh what what are captures so
captchas

3084
00:51:36,710 --> 00:51:36,720
captchas
 

3085
00:51:36,720 --> 00:51:39,750
captchas
are those strings that you fill in

3086
00:51:39,750 --> 00:51:39,760
are those strings that you fill in
 

3087
00:51:39,760 --> 00:51:41,510
are those strings that you fill in
uh when you're you know when if you're

3088
00:51:41,510 --> 00:51:41,520
uh when you're you know when if you're
 

3089
00:51:41,520 --> 00:51:43,190
uh when you're you know when if you're
opening a new account in google

3090
00:51:43,190 --> 00:51:43,200
opening a new account in google
 

3091
00:51:43,200 --> 00:51:45,910
opening a new account in google
they show you a picture you know usually

3092
00:51:45,910 --> 00:51:45,920
they show you a picture you know usually
 

3093
00:51:45,920 --> 00:51:46,790
they show you a picture you know usually
it used to be

3094
00:51:46,790 --> 00:51:46,800
it used to be
 

3095
00:51:46,800 --> 00:51:48,870
it used to be
a set of garbage letters uh that you

3096
00:51:48,870 --> 00:51:48,880
a set of garbage letters uh that you
 

3097
00:51:48,880 --> 00:51:50,150
a set of garbage letters uh that you
have to kind of

3098
00:51:50,150 --> 00:51:50,160
have to kind of
 

3099
00:51:50,160 --> 00:51:51,670
have to kind of
figure out what what what is that string

3100
00:51:51,670 --> 00:51:51,680
figure out what what what is that string
 

3101
00:51:51,680 --> 00:51:53,270
figure out what what what is that string
of characters and type in

3102
00:51:53,270 --> 00:51:53,280
of characters and type in
 

3103
00:51:53,280 --> 00:51:56,230
of characters and type in
and the reason cap just exist is because

3104
00:51:56,230 --> 00:51:56,240
and the reason cap just exist is because
 

3105
00:51:56,240 --> 00:51:57,670
and the reason cap just exist is because
you know

3106
00:51:57,670 --> 00:51:57,680
you know
 

3107
00:51:57,680 --> 00:52:00,870
you know
google or twitter do not want

3108
00:52:00,870 --> 00:52:00,880
google or twitter do not want
 

3109
00:52:00,880 --> 00:52:02,950
google or twitter do not want
automatic creation of accounts you can

3110
00:52:02,950 --> 00:52:02,960
automatic creation of accounts you can
 

3111
00:52:02,960 --> 00:52:04,069
automatic creation of accounts you can
use a computer

3112
00:52:04,069 --> 00:52:04,079
use a computer
 

3113
00:52:04,079 --> 00:52:07,670
use a computer
to create millions of accounts uh and uh

3114
00:52:07,670 --> 00:52:07,680
to create millions of accounts uh and uh
 

3115
00:52:07,680 --> 00:52:10,790
to create millions of accounts uh and uh
use that for in nefarious purposes uh so

3116
00:52:10,790 --> 00:52:10,800
use that for in nefarious purposes uh so
 

3117
00:52:10,800 --> 00:52:12,309
use that for in nefarious purposes uh so
you want to make sure that

3118
00:52:12,309 --> 00:52:12,319
you want to make sure that
 

3119
00:52:12,319 --> 00:52:14,549
you want to make sure that
to the extent possible the interaction

3120
00:52:14,549 --> 00:52:14,559
to the extent possible the interaction
 

3121
00:52:14,559 --> 00:52:16,870
to the extent possible the interaction
that your their system is having

3122
00:52:16,870 --> 00:52:16,880
that your their system is having
 

3123
00:52:16,880 --> 00:52:19,109
that your their system is having
is with a human so it's a it's called a

3124
00:52:19,109 --> 00:52:19,119
is with a human so it's a it's called a
 

3125
00:52:19,119 --> 00:52:20,790
is with a human so it's a it's called a
human interaction proof

3126
00:52:20,790 --> 00:52:20,800
human interaction proof
 

3127
00:52:20,800 --> 00:52:22,950
human interaction proof
a captcha is a human interaction proof

3128
00:52:22,950 --> 00:52:22,960
a captcha is a human interaction proof
 

3129
00:52:22,960 --> 00:52:24,470
a captcha is a human interaction proof
um so

3130
00:52:24,470 --> 00:52:24,480
um so
 

3131
00:52:24,480 --> 00:52:27,270
um so
so this is a captchas are by design

3132
00:52:27,270 --> 00:52:27,280
so this is a captchas are by design
 

3133
00:52:27,280 --> 00:52:28,150
so this is a captchas are by design
things that are

3134
00:52:28,150 --> 00:52:28,160
things that are
 

3135
00:52:28,160 --> 00:52:30,309
things that are
easy for humans to solve but hard for

3136
00:52:30,309 --> 00:52:30,319
easy for humans to solve but hard for
 

3137
00:52:30,319 --> 00:52:32,790
easy for humans to solve but hard for
computers hard for robots yeah

3138
00:52:32,790 --> 00:52:32,800
computers hard for robots yeah
 

3139
00:52:32,800 --> 00:52:35,990
computers hard for robots yeah
so and text-based captchas where

3140
00:52:35,990 --> 00:52:36,000
so and text-based captchas where
 

3141
00:52:36,000 --> 00:52:38,309
so and text-based captchas where
was the one which is prevalent and

3142
00:52:38,309 --> 00:52:38,319
was the one which is prevalent and
 

3143
00:52:38,319 --> 00:52:39,750
was the one which is prevalent and
around 2014

3144
00:52:39,750 --> 00:52:39,760
around 2014
 

3145
00:52:39,760 --> 00:52:41,670
around 2014
because at that time text-based voice

3146
00:52:41,670 --> 00:52:41,680
because at that time text-based voice
 

3147
00:52:41,680 --> 00:52:43,430
because at that time text-based voice
captures were hard for

3148
00:52:43,430 --> 00:52:43,440
captures were hard for
 

3149
00:52:43,440 --> 00:52:46,230
captures were hard for
computers to crack even now they are

3150
00:52:46,230 --> 00:52:46,240
computers to crack even now they are
 

3151
00:52:46,240 --> 00:52:46,710
computers to crack even now they are
actually

3152
00:52:46,710 --> 00:52:46,720
actually
 

3153
00:52:46,720 --> 00:52:48,950
actually
in the sense of an arbitrary text based

3154
00:52:48,950 --> 00:52:48,960
in the sense of an arbitrary text based
 

3155
00:52:48,960 --> 00:52:49,750
in the sense of an arbitrary text based
capture

3156
00:52:49,750 --> 00:52:49,760
capture
 

3157
00:52:49,760 --> 00:52:52,790
capture
will be unsolvable even now but with the

3158
00:52:52,790 --> 00:52:52,800
will be unsolvable even now but with the
 

3159
00:52:52,800 --> 00:52:54,150
will be unsolvable even now but with the
techniques that we have developed it can

3160
00:52:54,150 --> 00:52:54,160
techniques that we have developed it can
 

3161
00:52:54,160 --> 00:52:55,750
techniques that we have developed it can
be you know you can quickly develop

3162
00:52:55,750 --> 00:52:55,760
be you know you can quickly develop
 

3163
00:52:55,760 --> 00:52:58,870
be you know you can quickly develop
a mechanism that solves the captcha

3164
00:52:58,870 --> 00:52:58,880
a mechanism that solves the captcha
 

3165
00:52:58,880 --> 00:53:00,549
a mechanism that solves the captcha
they've probably gotten a lot harder too

3166
00:53:00,549 --> 00:53:00,559
they've probably gotten a lot harder too
 

3167
00:53:00,559 --> 00:53:02,309
they've probably gotten a lot harder too
the people

3168
00:53:02,309 --> 00:53:02,319
the people
 

3169
00:53:02,319 --> 00:53:03,829
the people
they've been getting clever and clever

3170
00:53:03,829 --> 00:53:03,839
they've been getting clever and clever
 

3171
00:53:03,839 --> 00:53:05,990
they've been getting clever and clever
generating these text characters yeah

3172
00:53:05,990 --> 00:53:06,000
generating these text characters yeah
 

3173
00:53:06,000 --> 00:53:07,829
generating these text characters yeah
right so okay so that was one of the

3174
00:53:07,829 --> 00:53:07,839
right so okay so that was one of the
 

3175
00:53:07,839 --> 00:53:09,109
right so okay so that was one of the
things you've tested

3176
00:53:09,109 --> 00:53:09,119
things you've tested
 

3177
00:53:09,119 --> 00:53:11,589
things you've tested
on is these kinds of captures in 2014

3178
00:53:11,589 --> 00:53:11,599
on is these kinds of captures in 2014
 

3179
00:53:11,599 --> 00:53:12,309
on is these kinds of captures in 2014
15.

3180
00:53:12,309 --> 00:53:12,319
15.
 

3181
00:53:12,319 --> 00:53:13,910
15.
got that kind of stuff right right so

3182
00:53:13,910 --> 00:53:13,920
got that kind of stuff right right so
 

3183
00:53:13,920 --> 00:53:15,750
got that kind of stuff right right so
what uh

3184
00:53:15,750 --> 00:53:15,760
what uh
 

3185
00:53:15,760 --> 00:53:18,549
what uh
what i mean why by the way why captchas

3186
00:53:18,549 --> 00:53:18,559
what i mean why by the way why captchas
 

3187
00:53:18,559 --> 00:53:18,950
what i mean why by the way why captchas
yeah

3188
00:53:18,950 --> 00:53:18,960
yeah
 

3189
00:53:18,960 --> 00:53:21,589
yeah
yeah even now i would say captcha is a

3190
00:53:21,589 --> 00:53:21,599
yeah even now i would say captcha is a
 

3191
00:53:21,599 --> 00:53:21,990
yeah even now i would say captcha is a
very

3192
00:53:21,990 --> 00:53:22,000
very
 

3193
00:53:22,000 --> 00:53:24,630
very
very good challenge problem uh if you

3194
00:53:24,630 --> 00:53:24,640
very good challenge problem uh if you
 

3195
00:53:24,640 --> 00:53:25,190
very good challenge problem uh if you
want to

3196
00:53:25,190 --> 00:53:25,200
want to
 

3197
00:53:25,200 --> 00:53:27,270
want to
understand how human perception works

3198
00:53:27,270 --> 00:53:27,280
understand how human perception works
 

3199
00:53:27,280 --> 00:53:28,790
understand how human perception works
and if you want to build

3200
00:53:28,790 --> 00:53:28,800
and if you want to build
 

3201
00:53:28,800 --> 00:53:31,109
and if you want to build
uh systems that work like the human

3202
00:53:31,109 --> 00:53:31,119
uh systems that work like the human
 

3203
00:53:31,119 --> 00:53:31,829
uh systems that work like the human
brain

3204
00:53:31,829 --> 00:53:31,839
brain
 

3205
00:53:31,839 --> 00:53:33,910
brain
uh and i wouldn't say captcha is a

3206
00:53:33,910 --> 00:53:33,920
uh and i wouldn't say captcha is a
 

3207
00:53:33,920 --> 00:53:35,270
uh and i wouldn't say captcha is a
solved problem we have

3208
00:53:35,270 --> 00:53:35,280
solved problem we have
 

3209
00:53:35,280 --> 00:53:36,790
solved problem we have
cracked the fundamental defense of

3210
00:53:36,790 --> 00:53:36,800
cracked the fundamental defense of
 

3211
00:53:36,800 --> 00:53:38,870
cracked the fundamental defense of
captures but it is not solved

3212
00:53:38,870 --> 00:53:38,880
captures but it is not solved
 

3213
00:53:38,880 --> 00:53:41,990
captures but it is not solved
in the way that humans solve it um

3214
00:53:41,990 --> 00:53:42,000
in the way that humans solve it um
 

3215
00:53:42,000 --> 00:53:45,270
in the way that humans solve it um
so i can give an example i can um take a

3216
00:53:45,270 --> 00:53:45,280
so i can give an example i can um take a
 

3217
00:53:45,280 --> 00:53:46,390
so i can give an example i can um take a
five-year-old child

3218
00:53:46,390 --> 00:53:46,400
five-year-old child
 

3219
00:53:46,400 --> 00:53:49,190
five-year-old child
who has just learned characters uh and

3220
00:53:49,190 --> 00:53:49,200
who has just learned characters uh and
 

3221
00:53:49,200 --> 00:53:50,470
who has just learned characters uh and
uh

3222
00:53:50,470 --> 00:53:50,480
uh
 

3223
00:53:50,480 --> 00:53:53,109
uh
show them any new capture that we create

3224
00:53:53,109 --> 00:53:53,119
show them any new capture that we create
 

3225
00:53:53,119 --> 00:53:55,349
show them any new capture that we create
they will be able to solve it

3226
00:53:55,349 --> 00:53:55,359
they will be able to solve it
 

3227
00:53:55,359 --> 00:53:57,990
they will be able to solve it
uh i can show you pretty much any new

3228
00:53:57,990 --> 00:53:58,000
uh i can show you pretty much any new
 

3229
00:53:58,000 --> 00:53:58,870
uh i can show you pretty much any new
capture

3230
00:53:58,870 --> 00:53:58,880
capture
 

3231
00:53:58,880 --> 00:54:01,109
capture
from any new website you'll be able to

3232
00:54:01,109 --> 00:54:01,119
from any new website you'll be able to
 

3233
00:54:01,119 --> 00:54:02,390
from any new website you'll be able to
solve it without getting

3234
00:54:02,390 --> 00:54:02,400
solve it without getting
 

3235
00:54:02,400 --> 00:54:04,549
solve it without getting
any training examples from that

3236
00:54:04,549 --> 00:54:04,559
any training examples from that
 

3237
00:54:04,559 --> 00:54:05,910
any training examples from that
particular style of captcha you're

3238
00:54:05,910 --> 00:54:05,920
particular style of captcha you're
 

3239
00:54:05,920 --> 00:54:07,750
particular style of captcha you're
assuming i'm human yeah yes

3240
00:54:07,750 --> 00:54:07,760
assuming i'm human yeah yes
 

3241
00:54:07,760 --> 00:54:11,030
assuming i'm human yeah yes
yeah that's right so if you are human

3242
00:54:11,030 --> 00:54:11,040
yeah that's right so if you are human
 

3243
00:54:11,040 --> 00:54:11,510
yeah that's right so if you are human
and

3244
00:54:11,510 --> 00:54:11,520
and
 

3245
00:54:11,520 --> 00:54:12,950
and
if you otherwise i will be able to

3246
00:54:12,950 --> 00:54:12,960
if you otherwise i will be able to
 

3247
00:54:12,960 --> 00:54:15,670
if you otherwise i will be able to
figure that out using this one

3248
00:54:15,670 --> 00:54:15,680
figure that out using this one
 

3249
00:54:15,680 --> 00:54:17,990
figure that out using this one
but uh so this whole podcast is just a

3250
00:54:17,990 --> 00:54:18,000
but uh so this whole podcast is just a
 

3251
00:54:18,000 --> 00:54:19,190
but uh so this whole podcast is just a
touring test

3252
00:54:19,190 --> 00:54:19,200
touring test
 

3253
00:54:19,200 --> 00:54:21,829
touring test
a long turing test anyway i'm sorry so

3254
00:54:21,829 --> 00:54:21,839
a long turing test anyway i'm sorry so
 

3255
00:54:21,839 --> 00:54:22,390
a long turing test anyway i'm sorry so
yeah

3256
00:54:22,390 --> 00:54:22,400
yeah
 

3257
00:54:22,400 --> 00:54:24,790
yeah
so human humans can figure it out with

3258
00:54:24,790 --> 00:54:24,800
so human humans can figure it out with
 

3259
00:54:24,800 --> 00:54:26,150
so human humans can figure it out with
very few examples

3260
00:54:26,150 --> 00:54:26,160
very few examples
 

3261
00:54:26,160 --> 00:54:28,630
very few examples
or no training examples like no training

3262
00:54:28,630 --> 00:54:28,640
or no training examples like no training
 

3263
00:54:28,640 --> 00:54:30,150
or no training examples like no training
examples from that particular style of

3264
00:54:30,150 --> 00:54:30,160
examples from that particular style of
 

3265
00:54:30,160 --> 00:54:31,109
examples from that particular style of
capture

3266
00:54:31,109 --> 00:54:31,119
capture
 

3267
00:54:31,119 --> 00:54:34,470
capture
and and so you can you know so uh even

3268
00:54:34,470 --> 00:54:34,480
and and so you can you know so uh even
 

3269
00:54:34,480 --> 00:54:35,190
and and so you can you know so uh even
now this is

3270
00:54:35,190 --> 00:54:35,200
now this is
 

3271
00:54:35,200 --> 00:54:37,589
now this is
unreachable for the current deep

3272
00:54:37,589 --> 00:54:37,599
unreachable for the current deep
 

3273
00:54:37,599 --> 00:54:38,470
unreachable for the current deep
learning system so

3274
00:54:38,470 --> 00:54:38,480
learning system so
 

3275
00:54:38,480 --> 00:54:40,470
learning system so
basically there is no i don't think a

3276
00:54:40,470 --> 00:54:40,480
basically there is no i don't think a
 

3277
00:54:40,480 --> 00:54:41,750
basically there is no i don't think a
system exists where you can basically

3278
00:54:41,750 --> 00:54:41,760
system exists where you can basically
 

3279
00:54:41,760 --> 00:54:42,309
system exists where you can basically
say

3280
00:54:42,309 --> 00:54:42,319
say
 

3281
00:54:42,319 --> 00:54:45,349
say
train on whatever you want and then now

3282
00:54:45,349 --> 00:54:45,359
train on whatever you want and then now
 

3283
00:54:45,359 --> 00:54:47,589
train on whatever you want and then now
say hey i will show you a new captcha

3284
00:54:47,589 --> 00:54:47,599
say hey i will show you a new captcha
 

3285
00:54:47,599 --> 00:54:49,430
say hey i will show you a new captcha
which i did not show you in

3286
00:54:49,430 --> 00:54:49,440
which i did not show you in
 

3287
00:54:49,440 --> 00:54:51,109
which i did not show you in
in the in the training setup will the

3288
00:54:51,109 --> 00:54:51,119
in the in the training setup will the
 

3289
00:54:51,119 --> 00:54:52,470
in the in the training setup will the
system be able to solve it

3290
00:54:52,470 --> 00:54:52,480
system be able to solve it
 

3291
00:54:52,480 --> 00:54:55,990
system be able to solve it
um it still doesn't exist so that is

3292
00:54:55,990 --> 00:54:56,000
um it still doesn't exist so that is
 

3293
00:54:56,000 --> 00:54:58,549
um it still doesn't exist so that is
the magic of human perception yeah and

3294
00:54:58,549 --> 00:54:58,559
the magic of human perception yeah and
 

3295
00:54:58,559 --> 00:54:59,589
the magic of human perception yeah and

problem
 

3303
00:55:06,720 --> 00:55:10,470
problem
in ai is what is the letter a

if you can if you can build a system

3306
00:55:12,630 --> 00:55:12,640
if you can if you can build a system
 

3307
00:55:12,640 --> 00:55:14,230
if you can if you can build a system
that reliably

3308
00:55:14,230 --> 00:55:14,240
that reliably
 

3309
00:55:14,240 --> 00:55:16,230
that reliably
can detect all the variations of the

3310
00:55:16,230 --> 00:55:16,240
can detect all the variations of the
 

3311
00:55:16,240 --> 00:55:17,829
can detect all the variations of the
letter a you don't even need to go to

3312
00:55:17,829 --> 00:55:17,839
letter a you don't even need to go to
 

3313
00:55:17,839 --> 00:55:19,750
letter a you don't even need to go to
the

3314
00:55:19,750 --> 00:55:19,760
the
 

3315
00:55:19,760 --> 00:55:21,990
the
v and the c yeah you don't even know the

3316
00:55:21,990 --> 00:55:22,000
v and the c yeah you don't even know the
 

3317
00:55:22,000 --> 00:55:24,069
v and the c yeah you don't even know the
b and c or the strings of characters

3318
00:55:24,069 --> 00:55:24,079
b and c or the strings of characters
 

3319
00:55:24,079 --> 00:55:26,470
b and c or the strings of characters
and uh so that that is the spirit at

3320
00:55:26,470 --> 00:55:26,480
and uh so that that is the spirit at
 

3321
00:55:26,480 --> 00:55:27,829
and uh so that that is the spirit at
which you know with which we

3322
00:55:27,829 --> 00:55:27,839
which you know with which we
 

3323
00:55:27,839 --> 00:55:29,990
which you know with which we
uh tackle that what does it mean by that

3324
00:55:29,990 --> 00:55:30,000
uh tackle that what does it mean by that
 

3325
00:55:30,000 --> 00:55:31,829
uh tackle that what does it mean by that
i mean is it uh

3326
00:55:31,829 --> 00:55:31,839
i mean is it uh
 

3327
00:55:31,839 --> 00:55:35,349
i mean is it uh
like without training examples try to

3328
00:55:35,349 --> 00:55:35,359

the fundamental uh elements that make
 

3333
00:55:39,680 --> 00:55:43,670
the fundamental uh elements that make
up the letter a in all of its forms in

all of its forms it can be
 

3337
00:55:45,119 --> 00:55:46,950
all of its forms it can be
a can be made with two humans standing

and uh it can be made of leaves it can
 

3345
00:55:51,760 --> 00:55:53,670
and uh it can be made of leaves it can
be yeah you might have to understand

3363
00:56:11,200 --> 00:56:14,390

yeah okay so what how does this kind of

3364
00:56:14,390 --> 00:56:14,400
yeah okay so what how does this kind of
 

3365
00:56:14,400 --> 00:56:17,349
yeah okay so what how does this kind of
the rcn architecture help us to get a do

a
 

3369
00:56:17,599 --> 00:56:20,230
a
better job of that kind of yeah so uh as

3370
00:56:20,230 --> 00:56:20,240
better job of that kind of yeah so uh as
 

3371
00:56:20,240 --> 00:56:21,190
better job of that kind of yeah so uh as
i mentioned

3372
00:56:21,190 --> 00:56:21,200
i mentioned
 

3373
00:56:21,200 --> 00:56:23,349
i mentioned
one of the important things was being

3374
00:56:23,349 --> 00:56:23,359
one of the important things was being
 

3375
00:56:23,359 --> 00:56:24,950
one of the important things was being
able to do inference

3376
00:56:24,950 --> 00:56:24,960
able to do inference
 

3377
00:56:24,960 --> 00:56:27,109
able to do inference
being able to dynamically do in france

3378
00:56:27,109 --> 00:56:27,119
being able to dynamically do in france
 

3379
00:56:27,119 --> 00:56:28,630
being able to dynamically do in france
can you can you uh

3380
00:56:28,630 --> 00:56:28,640
can you can you uh
 

3381
00:56:28,640 --> 00:56:30,950
can you can you uh
can you uh clarify what you mean because

3382
00:56:30,950 --> 00:56:30,960
can you uh clarify what you mean because
 

3383
00:56:30,960 --> 00:56:32,470
can you uh clarify what you mean because
you said like neural networks don't do

3384
00:56:32,470 --> 00:56:32,480
you said like neural networks don't do
 

3385
00:56:32,480 --> 00:56:33,109
you said like neural networks don't do
inference

3386
00:56:33,109 --> 00:56:33,119
inference
 

3387
00:56:33,119 --> 00:56:35,030
inference
yeah so what do you mean by inference in

3388
00:56:35,030 --> 00:56:35,040
yeah so what do you mean by inference in
 

3389
00:56:35,040 --> 00:56:36,470
yeah so what do you mean by inference in
this context then so

3390
00:56:36,470 --> 00:56:36,480
this context then so
 

3391
00:56:36,480 --> 00:56:39,109
this context then so
okay so in captures what they do to

3392
00:56:39,109 --> 00:56:39,119
okay so in captures what they do to
 

3393
00:56:39,119 --> 00:56:40,230
okay so in captures what they do to
confuse people

3394
00:56:40,230 --> 00:56:40,240
confuse people
 

3395
00:56:40,240 --> 00:56:42,150
confuse people
is to make these characters crowd

3396
00:56:42,150 --> 00:56:42,160
is to make these characters crowd
 

3397
00:56:42,160 --> 00:56:43,430
is to make these characters crowd
together

3398
00:56:43,430 --> 00:56:43,440
together
 

3399
00:56:43,440 --> 00:56:44,950
together
yes okay and when you make the

3400
00:56:44,950 --> 00:56:44,960
yes okay and when you make the
 

3401
00:56:44,960 --> 00:56:46,549
yes okay and when you make the
characters crowd together

3402
00:56:46,549 --> 00:56:46,559
characters crowd together
 

3403
00:56:46,559 --> 00:56:48,470
characters crowd together
what happens is that you will now start

3404
00:56:48,470 --> 00:56:48,480
what happens is that you will now start
 

3405
00:56:48,480 --> 00:56:50,870
what happens is that you will now start
seeing combinations of characters as

3406
00:56:50,870 --> 00:56:50,880
seeing combinations of characters as
 

3407
00:56:50,880 --> 00:56:52,789
seeing combinations of characters as
some other new character or or an

3408
00:56:52,789 --> 00:56:52,799
some other new character or or an
 

3409
00:56:52,799 --> 00:56:54,470
some other new character or or an
existing character so you would

3410
00:56:54,470 --> 00:56:54,480
existing character so you would
 

3411
00:56:54,480 --> 00:56:56,789
existing character so you would
you would put an r and n together it

3412
00:56:56,789 --> 00:56:56,799
you would put an r and n together it
 

3413
00:56:56,799 --> 00:56:58,630
you would put an r and n together it
will start looking like an m

3414
00:56:58,630 --> 00:56:58,640
will start looking like an m
 

3415
00:56:58,640 --> 00:57:01,670
will start looking like an m
uh and and so locally they are you know

3416
00:57:01,670 --> 00:57:01,680
uh and and so locally they are you know
 

3417
00:57:01,680 --> 00:57:04,230
uh and and so locally they are you know
there is very strong evidence for it

3418
00:57:04,230 --> 00:57:04,240
there is very strong evidence for it
 

3419
00:57:04,240 --> 00:57:05,030
there is very strong evidence for it
being

3420
00:57:05,030 --> 00:57:05,040
being
 

3421
00:57:05,040 --> 00:57:08,950
being
uh some uh incorrect character

3422
00:57:08,950 --> 00:57:08,960
uh some uh incorrect character
 

3423
00:57:08,960 --> 00:57:11,510
uh some uh incorrect character
but globally the only explanation that

3424
00:57:11,510 --> 00:57:11,520
but globally the only explanation that
 

3425
00:57:11,520 --> 00:57:12,630
but globally the only explanation that
fits together

3426
00:57:12,630 --> 00:57:12,640
fits together
 

3427
00:57:12,640 --> 00:57:14,470
fits together
is something that is different from what

3428
00:57:14,470 --> 00:57:14,480
is something that is different from what
 

3429
00:57:14,480 --> 00:57:16,069
is something that is different from what
you can find locally

3430
00:57:16,069 --> 00:57:16,079
you can find locally
 

3431
00:57:16,079 --> 00:57:19,030
you can find locally
yes so so so this is inference you are

3432
00:57:19,030 --> 00:57:19,040
yes so so so this is inference you are
 

3433
00:57:19,040 --> 00:57:20,309
yes so so so this is inference you are
basically taking

3434
00:57:20,309 --> 00:57:20,319
basically taking
 

3435
00:57:20,319 --> 00:57:23,349
basically taking
uh local evidence and putting it in the

3436
00:57:23,349 --> 00:57:23,359
uh local evidence and putting it in the
 

3437
00:57:23,359 --> 00:57:24,549
uh local evidence and putting it in the
global context

3438
00:57:24,549 --> 00:57:24,559
global context
 

3439
00:57:24,559 --> 00:57:27,670
global context
and often coming to a conclusion locally

3440
00:57:27,670 --> 00:57:27,680
and often coming to a conclusion locally
 

3441
00:57:27,680 --> 00:57:28,309
and often coming to a conclusion locally
which is

3442
00:57:28,309 --> 00:57:28,319
which is
 

3443
00:57:28,319 --> 00:57:29,990
which is
conflicting with the local information

3444
00:57:29,990 --> 00:57:30,000
conflicting with the local information
 

3445
00:57:30,000 --> 00:57:31,430
conflicting with the local information
so actually so

3446
00:57:31,430 --> 00:57:31,440
so actually so
 

3447
00:57:31,440 --> 00:57:34,309
so actually so
you mean inference like uh in the way

3448
00:57:34,309 --> 00:57:34,319
you mean inference like uh in the way
 

3449
00:57:34,319 --> 00:57:35,349
you mean inference like uh in the way
it's used

3450
00:57:35,349 --> 00:57:35,359
it's used
 

3451
00:57:35,359 --> 00:57:36,789
it's used
when you talk about reasoning for

3452
00:57:36,789 --> 00:57:36,799
when you talk about reasoning for
 

3453
00:57:36,799 --> 00:57:38,789
when you talk about reasoning for
example uh as opposed to like

3454
00:57:38,789 --> 00:57:38,799
example uh as opposed to like
 

3455
00:57:38,799 --> 00:57:41,030
example uh as opposed to like
inference which is this when you know

3456
00:57:41,030 --> 00:57:41,040
inference which is this when you know
 

3457
00:57:41,040 --> 00:57:42,630
inference which is this when you know
with artificial neural networks which is

3458
00:57:42,630 --> 00:57:42,640
with artificial neural networks which is
 

3459
00:57:42,640 --> 00:57:44,470
with artificial neural networks which is
a single pass through the network

3460
00:57:44,470 --> 00:57:44,480
a single pass through the network
 

3461
00:57:44,480 --> 00:57:47,030
a single pass through the network
okay so like you're basically doing some

3462
00:57:47,030 --> 00:57:47,040
okay so like you're basically doing some
 

3463
00:57:47,040 --> 00:57:48,710
okay so like you're basically doing some
basic forms of reasoning

3464
00:57:48,710 --> 00:57:48,720
basic forms of reasoning
 

3465
00:57:48,720 --> 00:57:52,069
basic forms of reasoning
like integration of like uh how local

3466
00:57:52,069 --> 00:57:52,079
like integration of like uh how local
 

3467
00:57:52,079 --> 00:57:54,309
like integration of like uh how local
things fit into the the global picture

3468
00:57:54,309 --> 00:57:54,319
things fit into the the global picture
 

3469
00:57:54,319 --> 00:57:56,069
things fit into the the global picture
and and things like explaining away

3470
00:57:56,069 --> 00:57:56,079
and and things like explaining away
 

3471
00:57:56,079 --> 00:57:57,430
and and things like explaining away
coming into this one because

3472
00:57:57,430 --> 00:57:57,440
coming into this one because
 

3473
00:57:57,440 --> 00:57:59,829
coming into this one because
you are you are uh explaining that piece

3474
00:57:59,829 --> 00:57:59,839
you are you are uh explaining that piece
 

3475
00:57:59,839 --> 00:58:00,870
you are you are uh explaining that piece
of evidence

3476
00:58:00,870 --> 00:58:00,880
of evidence
 

3477
00:58:00,880 --> 00:58:04,150
of evidence
uh as something else uh because globally

3478
00:58:04,150 --> 00:58:04,160
uh as something else uh because globally
 

3479
00:58:04,160 --> 00:58:05,510
uh as something else uh because globally
that's the only thing that makes sense

3480
00:58:05,510 --> 00:58:05,520
that's the only thing that makes sense
 

3481
00:58:05,520 --> 00:58:08,549
that's the only thing that makes sense
um so now yeah you

3482
00:58:08,549 --> 00:58:08,559
um so now yeah you
 

3483
00:58:08,559 --> 00:58:11,750
um so now yeah you
can amortize this inference by

3484
00:58:11,750 --> 00:58:11,760
can amortize this inference by
 

3485
00:58:11,760 --> 00:58:13,510
can amortize this inference by
you know in a neural network if you want

3486
00:58:13,510 --> 00:58:13,520
you know in a neural network if you want
 

3487
00:58:13,520 --> 00:58:15,109
you know in a neural network if you want
to do this what you you can

3488
00:58:15,109 --> 00:58:15,119
to do this what you you can
 

3489
00:58:15,119 --> 00:58:17,190
to do this what you you can
you can brute force it you can just show

3490
00:58:17,190 --> 00:58:17,200
you can brute force it you can just show
 

3491
00:58:17,200 --> 00:58:19,349
you can brute force it you can just show
it all combinations of things

3492
00:58:19,349 --> 00:58:19,359
it all combinations of things
 

3493
00:58:19,359 --> 00:58:21,750
it all combinations of things
that you want to you want to your

3494
00:58:21,750 --> 00:58:21,760
that you want to you want to your
 

3495
00:58:21,760 --> 00:58:23,190
that you want to you want to your
reasoning to work over

3496
00:58:23,190 --> 00:58:23,200
reasoning to work over
 

3497
00:58:23,200 --> 00:58:25,750
reasoning to work over
and you can you know like just train the

3498
00:58:25,750 --> 00:58:25,760
and you can you know like just train the
 

3499
00:58:25,760 --> 00:58:27,270
and you can you know like just train the
help out of that neural network

3500
00:58:27,270 --> 00:58:27,280
help out of that neural network
 

3501
00:58:27,280 --> 00:58:30,309
help out of that neural network
and it will look like it is doing uh you

3502
00:58:30,309 --> 00:58:30,319
and it will look like it is doing uh you
 

3503
00:58:30,319 --> 00:58:31,990
and it will look like it is doing uh you
know inference on the fly but it is it

3504
00:58:31,990 --> 00:58:32,000
know inference on the fly but it is it
 

3505
00:58:32,000 --> 00:58:32,309
know inference on the fly but it is it
is

3506
00:58:32,309 --> 00:58:32,319
is
 

3507
00:58:32,319 --> 00:58:35,030
is
really just doing amortized inference it

3508
00:58:35,030 --> 00:58:35,040
really just doing amortized inference it
 

3509
00:58:35,040 --> 00:58:36,069
really just doing amortized inference it
is because you

3510
00:58:36,069 --> 00:58:36,079
is because you
 

3511
00:58:36,079 --> 00:58:37,990
is because you
you have shown it a lot of these

3512
00:58:37,990 --> 00:58:38,000
you have shown it a lot of these
 

3513
00:58:38,000 --> 00:58:39,990
you have shown it a lot of these
combinations during training time

3514
00:58:39,990 --> 00:58:40,000
combinations during training time
 

3515
00:58:40,000 --> 00:58:43,109
combinations during training time
um so what you want to do is be able to

3516
00:58:43,109 --> 00:58:43,119
um so what you want to do is be able to
 

3517
00:58:43,119 --> 00:58:45,510
um so what you want to do is be able to
do dynamic inference rather than just

3518
00:58:45,510 --> 00:58:45,520
do dynamic inference rather than just
 

3519
00:58:45,520 --> 00:58:46,630
do dynamic inference rather than just
being able to show all those

3520
00:58:46,630 --> 00:58:46,640
being able to show all those
 

3521
00:58:46,640 --> 00:58:48,630
being able to show all those
combinations in the training time and

3522
00:58:48,630 --> 00:58:48,640
combinations in the training time and
 

3523
00:58:48,640 --> 00:58:50,390
combinations in the training time and
that's something we emphasized in the

3524
00:58:50,390 --> 00:58:50,400
that's something we emphasized in the
 

3525
00:58:50,400 --> 00:58:51,829
that's something we emphasized in the
model

3526
00:58:51,829 --> 00:58:51,839
model
 

3527
00:58:51,839 --> 00:58:53,910
model
what does it mean dynamic in france is

3528
00:58:53,910 --> 00:58:53,920
what does it mean dynamic in france is
 

3529
00:58:53,920 --> 00:58:55,829
what does it mean dynamic in france is
that that has to do with the feedback

3530
00:58:55,829 --> 00:58:55,839
that that has to do with the feedback
 

3531
00:58:55,839 --> 00:58:58,950
that that has to do with the feedback
thing yes like what what is dynamic i

3532
00:58:58,950 --> 00:58:58,960
thing yes like what what is dynamic i
 

3533
00:58:58,960 --> 00:59:00,950
thing yes like what what is dynamic i
i'm trying to visualize what dynamic

3534
00:59:00,950 --> 00:59:00,960
i'm trying to visualize what dynamic
 

3535
00:59:00,960 --> 00:59:02,470
i'm trying to visualize what dynamic
influence would be in this case

3536
00:59:02,470 --> 00:59:02,480
influence would be in this case
 

3537
00:59:02,480 --> 00:59:05,030
influence would be in this case
like what is it doing with the input

3538
00:59:05,030 --> 00:59:05,040
like what is it doing with the input
 

3539
00:59:05,040 --> 00:59:07,670
like what is it doing with the input
it's showing the input the first time

3540
00:59:07,670 --> 00:59:07,680
it's showing the input the first time
 

3541
00:59:07,680 --> 00:59:10,789
it's showing the input the first time
yeah and is is like what's changing over

3542
00:59:10,789 --> 00:59:10,799
yeah and is is like what's changing over
 

3543
00:59:10,799 --> 00:59:11,829
yeah and is is like what's changing over
temporally

3544
00:59:11,829 --> 00:59:11,839
temporally
 

3545
00:59:11,839 --> 00:59:13,829
temporally
over what's the dynamics of this

3546
00:59:13,829 --> 00:59:13,839
over what's the dynamics of this
 

3547
00:59:13,839 --> 00:59:14,950
over what's the dynamics of this
inference process

3548
00:59:14,950 --> 00:59:14,960
inference process
 

3549
00:59:14,960 --> 00:59:17,589
inference process
so you can think of it as you have um at

3550
00:59:17,589 --> 00:59:17,599
so you can think of it as you have um at
 

3551
00:59:17,599 --> 00:59:17,990
so you can think of it as you have um at
the top

3552
00:59:17,990 --> 00:59:18,000
the top
 

3553
00:59:18,000 --> 00:59:20,230
the top
of the model the characters that you are

3554
00:59:20,230 --> 00:59:20,240
of the model the characters that you are
 

3555
00:59:20,240 --> 00:59:22,870
of the model the characters that you are
trained on yeah they are the causes

3556
00:59:22,870 --> 00:59:22,880
trained on yeah they are the causes
 

3557
00:59:22,880 --> 00:59:24,549
trained on yeah they are the causes
they you are trying to explain the

3558
00:59:24,549 --> 00:59:24,559
they you are trying to explain the
 

3559
00:59:24,559 --> 00:59:26,549
they you are trying to explain the
pixels using

3560
00:59:26,549 --> 00:59:26,559
pixels using
 

3561
00:59:26,559 --> 00:59:29,270
pixels using
the characters as the causes the you

3562
00:59:29,270 --> 00:59:29,280
the characters as the causes the you
 

3563
00:59:29,280 --> 00:59:30,390
the characters as the causes the you
know the characters

3564
00:59:30,390 --> 00:59:30,400
know the characters
 

3565
00:59:30,400 --> 00:59:33,030
know the characters
are the things that cause the pixels

3566
00:59:33,030 --> 00:59:33,040
are the things that cause the pixels
 

3567
00:59:33,040 --> 00:59:35,430
are the things that cause the pixels
yeah so there's this causality thing so

3568
00:59:35,430 --> 00:59:35,440
yeah so there's this causality thing so
 

3569
00:59:35,440 --> 00:59:37,349
yeah so there's this causality thing so
the reason you mentioned causality i

3570
00:59:37,349 --> 00:59:37,359
the reason you mentioned causality i
 

3571
00:59:37,359 --> 00:59:38,950
the reason you mentioned causality i
guess is because there's a temporal

3572
00:59:38,950 --> 00:59:38,960
guess is because there's a temporal
 

3573
00:59:38,960 --> 00:59:40,789
guess is because there's a temporal
aspect of this whole thing

3574
00:59:40,789 --> 00:59:40,799
aspect of this whole thing
 

3575
00:59:40,799 --> 00:59:42,230
aspect of this whole thing
in this particular case the temporal

3576
00:59:42,230 --> 00:59:42,240
in this particular case the temporal
 

3577
00:59:42,240 --> 00:59:44,069
in this particular case the temporal
aspect is not important it is more like

3578
00:59:44,069 --> 00:59:44,079
aspect is not important it is more like
 

3579
00:59:44,079 --> 00:59:47,750
aspect is not important it is more like
when if if i turn the character on

3580
00:59:47,750 --> 00:59:47,760
when if if i turn the character on
 

3581
00:59:47,760 --> 00:59:49,589
when if if i turn the character on
the the pixels will turn on yeah it will

3582
00:59:49,589 --> 00:59:49,599
the the pixels will turn on yeah it will
 

3583
00:59:49,599 --> 00:59:51,030
the the pixels will turn on yeah it will
be after there's a little bit but

3584
00:59:51,030 --> 00:59:51,040
be after there's a little bit but
 

3585
00:59:51,040 --> 00:59:52,870
be after there's a little bit but
okay so that is the causality in the

3586
00:59:52,870 --> 00:59:52,880
okay so that is the causality in the
 

3587
00:59:52,880 --> 00:59:55,589
okay so that is the causality in the
sense of like a logic causality like

3588
00:59:55,589 --> 00:59:55,599
sense of like a logic causality like
 

3589
00:59:55,599 --> 00:59:58,309
sense of like a logic causality like
hence inference okay the dynamics is

3590
00:59:58,309 --> 00:59:58,319
hence inference okay the dynamics is
 

3591
00:59:58,319 --> 00:59:59,109
hence inference okay the dynamics is
that

3592
00:59:59,109 --> 00:59:59,119
that
 

3593
00:59:59,119 --> 01:00:02,150
that
uh even though locally it will look like

3594
01:00:02,150 --> 01:00:02,160
uh even though locally it will look like
 

3595
01:00:02,160 --> 01:00:05,190
uh even though locally it will look like
okay this is an a

3596
01:00:05,190 --> 01:00:05,200
okay this is an a
 

3597
01:00:05,200 --> 01:00:07,589
okay this is an a
and and locally just when i look at just

3598
01:00:07,589 --> 01:00:07,599
and and locally just when i look at just
 

3599
01:00:07,599 --> 01:00:09,030
and and locally just when i look at just
that patch of the image

3600
01:00:09,030 --> 01:00:09,040
that patch of the image
 

3601
01:00:09,040 --> 01:00:11,990
that patch of the image
it looks like an a but when i look at it

3602
01:00:11,990 --> 01:00:12,000
it looks like an a but when i look at it
 

3603
01:00:12,000 --> 01:00:14,390
it looks like an a but when i look at it
in the context of all the other courses

3604
01:00:14,390 --> 01:00:14,400
in the context of all the other courses
 

3605
01:00:14,400 --> 01:00:16,630
in the context of all the other courses
it might no am is not the something that

3606
01:00:16,630 --> 01:00:16,640
it might no am is not the something that
 

3607
01:00:16,640 --> 01:00:18,069
it might no am is not the something that
makes sense so that is something you

3608
01:00:18,069 --> 01:00:18,079
makes sense so that is something you
 

3609
01:00:18,079 --> 01:00:19,030
makes sense so that is something you
have to kind of

3610
01:00:19,030 --> 01:00:19,040
have to kind of
 

3611
01:00:19,040 --> 01:00:21,829
have to kind of
you know recursively figure out yeah so

3612
01:00:21,829 --> 01:00:21,839
you know recursively figure out yeah so
 

3613
01:00:21,839 --> 01:00:22,470
you know recursively figure out yeah so
okay so

3614
01:00:22,470 --> 01:00:22,480
okay so
 

3615
01:00:22,480 --> 01:00:25,030
okay so
uh and uh this thing performed pretty

3616
01:00:25,030 --> 01:00:25,040
uh and uh this thing performed pretty
 

3617
01:00:25,040 --> 01:00:26,150
uh and uh this thing performed pretty
well on the captchas

3618
01:00:26,150 --> 01:00:26,160
well on the captchas
 

3619
01:00:26,160 --> 01:00:29,349
well on the captchas
correct and um

3620
01:00:29,349 --> 01:00:29,359
correct and um
 

3621
01:00:29,359 --> 01:00:31,270
correct and um
i mean is there some kind of interesting

3622
01:00:31,270 --> 01:00:31,280
i mean is there some kind of interesting
 

3623
01:00:31,280 --> 01:00:32,950
i mean is there some kind of interesting
intuition you can provide

3624
01:00:32,950 --> 01:00:32,960
intuition you can provide
 

3625
01:00:32,960 --> 01:00:35,910
intuition you can provide
why did well like what did it look like

3626
01:00:35,910 --> 01:00:35,920
why did well like what did it look like
 

3627
01:00:35,920 --> 01:00:37,589
why did well like what did it look like
is there visualizations that could be

3628
01:00:37,589 --> 01:00:37,599
is there visualizations that could be
 

3629
01:00:37,599 --> 01:00:39,670
is there visualizations that could be
human interpretable to us humans

3630
01:00:39,670 --> 01:00:39,680
human interpretable to us humans
 

3631
01:00:39,680 --> 01:00:41,589
human interpretable to us humans
yes yeah so the good thing about the

3632
01:00:41,589 --> 01:00:41,599
yes yeah so the good thing about the
 

3633
01:00:41,599 --> 01:00:42,789
yes yeah so the good thing about the
model is that it is

3634
01:00:42,789 --> 01:00:42,799
model is that it is
 

3635
01:00:42,799 --> 01:00:45,510
model is that it is
extremely um so it is not just doing a

3636
01:00:45,510 --> 01:00:45,520
extremely um so it is not just doing a
 

3637
01:00:45,520 --> 01:00:46,309
extremely um so it is not just doing a
classification

3638
01:00:46,309 --> 01:00:46,319
classification
 

3639
01:00:46,319 --> 01:00:48,630
classification
right it is it is it is it is providing

3640
01:00:48,630 --> 01:00:48,640
right it is it is it is it is providing
 

3641
01:00:48,640 --> 01:00:50,470
right it is it is it is it is providing
a full explanation for the scene

3642
01:00:50,470 --> 01:00:50,480
a full explanation for the scene
 

3643
01:00:50,480 --> 01:00:53,750
a full explanation for the scene
so when when it when it um

3644
01:00:53,750 --> 01:00:53,760
so when when it when it um
 

3645
01:00:53,760 --> 01:00:56,549
so when when it when it um
operates on a scene it is coming at back

3646
01:00:56,549 --> 01:00:56,559
operates on a scene it is coming at back
 

3647
01:00:56,559 --> 01:00:57,589
operates on a scene it is coming at back
and saying look

3648
01:00:57,589 --> 01:00:57,599
and saying look
 

3649
01:00:57,599 --> 01:01:00,230
and saying look
this is the part is the a and these are

3650
01:01:00,230 --> 01:01:00,240
this is the part is the a and these are
 

3651
01:01:00,240 --> 01:01:02,309
this is the part is the a and these are
the pixels that turned on

3652
01:01:02,309 --> 01:01:02,319
the pixels that turned on
 

3653
01:01:02,319 --> 01:01:04,870
the pixels that turned on
uh these are the pixels in the input

3654
01:01:04,870 --> 01:01:04,880
uh these are the pixels in the input
 

3655
01:01:04,880 --> 01:01:06,950
uh these are the pixels in the input
that tells makes me think that

3656
01:01:06,950 --> 01:01:06,960
that tells makes me think that
 

3657
01:01:06,960 --> 01:01:09,430
that tells makes me think that
it is an a and also these are the

3658
01:01:09,430 --> 01:01:09,440
it is an a and also these are the
 

3659
01:01:09,440 --> 01:01:11,750
it is an a and also these are the
portions i hallucinated

3660
01:01:11,750 --> 01:01:11,760
portions i hallucinated
 

3661
01:01:11,760 --> 01:01:14,069
portions i hallucinated
it you know it it provides a complete

3662
01:01:14,069 --> 01:01:14,079
it you know it it provides a complete
 

3663
01:01:14,079 --> 01:01:15,589
it you know it it provides a complete
explanation of that form and

3664
01:01:15,589 --> 01:01:15,599
explanation of that form and
 

3665
01:01:15,599 --> 01:01:17,750
explanation of that form and
then it's again these are the contours

3666
01:01:17,750 --> 01:01:17,760
then it's again these are the contours
 

3667
01:01:17,760 --> 01:01:19,589
then it's again these are the contours
these are this is the interior

3668
01:01:19,589 --> 01:01:19,599
these are this is the interior
 

3669
01:01:19,599 --> 01:01:21,990
these are this is the interior
and this is in front of this other

3670
01:01:21,990 --> 01:01:22,000
and this is in front of this other
 

3671
01:01:22,000 --> 01:01:22,950
and this is in front of this other
object so

3672
01:01:22,950 --> 01:01:22,960
object so
 

3673
01:01:22,960 --> 01:01:25,589
object so
that that's the kind of um explanation

3674
01:01:25,589 --> 01:01:25,599
that that's the kind of um explanation
 

3675
01:01:25,599 --> 01:01:26,309
that that's the kind of um explanation
it uh

3676
01:01:26,309 --> 01:01:26,319
it uh
 

3677
01:01:26,319 --> 01:01:28,950
it uh
the the inference network provides so so

3678
01:01:28,950 --> 01:01:28,960
the the inference network provides so so
 

3679
01:01:28,960 --> 01:01:29,589
the the inference network provides so so
that

3680
01:01:29,589 --> 01:01:29,599
that
 

3681
01:01:29,599 --> 01:01:33,430
that
that is useful and interpretable um

3682
01:01:33,430 --> 01:01:33,440
that is useful and interpretable um
 

3683
01:01:33,440 --> 01:01:37,430
that is useful and interpretable um
and uh um then the kind of errors it

3684
01:01:37,430 --> 01:01:37,440
and uh um then the kind of errors it
 

3685
01:01:37,440 --> 01:01:38,069
and uh um then the kind of errors it
makes

3686
01:01:38,069 --> 01:01:38,079
makes
 

3687
01:01:38,079 --> 01:01:41,910
makes
are also i don't want to um

3688
01:01:41,910 --> 01:01:41,920
are also i don't want to um
 

3689
01:01:41,920 --> 01:01:43,750
are also i don't want to um
read too much into it but the kind of

3690
01:01:43,750 --> 01:01:43,760
read too much into it but the kind of
 

3691
01:01:43,760 --> 01:01:46,390
read too much into it but the kind of
errors the network makes are

3692
01:01:46,390 --> 01:01:46,400
errors the network makes are
 

3693
01:01:46,400 --> 01:01:48,150
errors the network makes are
very similar to the kinds of errors

3694
01:01:48,150 --> 01:01:48,160
very similar to the kinds of errors
 

3695
01:01:48,160 --> 01:01:49,589
very similar to the kinds of errors
humans would make in

3696
01:01:49,589 --> 01:01:49,599
humans would make in
 

3697
01:01:49,599 --> 01:01:50,950
humans would make in
a similar situation so there's something

3698
01:01:50,950 --> 01:01:50,960
a similar situation so there's something
 

3699
01:01:50,960 --> 01:01:52,710
a similar situation so there's something
about the structure that's uh

3700
01:01:52,710 --> 01:01:52,720
about the structure that's uh
 

3701
01:01:52,720 --> 01:01:55,190
about the structure that's uh
feels reminiscent of the way humans

3702
01:01:55,190 --> 01:01:55,200
feels reminiscent of the way humans
 

3703
01:01:55,200 --> 01:01:57,029
feels reminiscent of the way humans
visual

3704
01:01:57,029 --> 01:01:57,039

3705
01:01:57,039 --> 01:02:00,549

system works well i mean uh how

3706
01:02:00,549 --> 01:02:00,559
system works well i mean uh how
 

3707
01:02:00,559 --> 01:02:01,349
system works well i mean uh how
hard-coded

3708
01:02:01,349 --> 01:02:01,359
hard-coded
 

3709
01:02:01,359 --> 01:02:03,990
hard-coded
is this to the capture problem this idea

3710
01:02:03,990 --> 01:02:04,000
is this to the capture problem this idea
 

3711
01:02:04,000 --> 01:02:04,390
is this to the capture problem this idea
uh

3712
01:02:04,390 --> 01:02:04,400
uh
 

3713
01:02:04,400 --> 01:02:06,630
uh
not really hardcoded because it's the uh

3714
01:02:06,630 --> 01:02:06,640
not really hardcoded because it's the uh
 

3715
01:02:06,640 --> 01:02:08,630
not really hardcoded because it's the uh
the assumptions as i mentioned are

3716
01:02:08,630 --> 01:02:08,640
the assumptions as i mentioned are
 

3717
01:02:08,640 --> 01:02:11,589
the assumptions as i mentioned are
general right it is more um and and

3718
01:02:11,589 --> 01:02:11,599
general right it is more um and and
 

3719
01:02:11,599 --> 01:02:12,069
general right it is more um and and
those

3720
01:02:12,069 --> 01:02:12,079
those
 

3721
01:02:12,079 --> 01:02:13,990
those
themselves can be applied in many

3722
01:02:13,990 --> 01:02:14,000
themselves can be applied in many
 

3723
01:02:14,000 --> 01:02:15,430
themselves can be applied in many
situations which are

3724
01:02:15,430 --> 01:02:15,440
situations which are
 

3725
01:02:15,440 --> 01:02:17,910
situations which are
natural signals um so it's it's the

3726
01:02:17,910 --> 01:02:17,920
natural signals um so it's it's the
 

3727
01:02:17,920 --> 01:02:18,950
natural signals um so it's it's the
foreground versus

3728
01:02:18,950 --> 01:02:18,960
foreground versus
 

3729
01:02:18,960 --> 01:02:21,750
foreground versus
background factorization and the

3730
01:02:21,750 --> 01:02:21,760
background factorization and the
 

3731
01:02:21,760 --> 01:02:23,029
background factorization and the

01:02:23,029 --> 01:02:23,039
factorization of
 

3733
01:02:23,039 --> 01:02:25,510
factorization of
the surfaces versus the contours so

3734
01:02:25,510 --> 01:02:25,520
the surfaces versus the contours so
 

3735
01:02:25,520 --> 01:02:27,029
the surfaces versus the contours so
these are all generally applicable

3736
01:02:27,029 --> 01:02:27,039
these are all generally applicable
 

3737
01:02:27,039 --> 01:02:30,789
these are all generally applicable
assumptions in our vision so why why

3738
01:02:30,789 --> 01:02:30,799
assumptions in our vision so why why
 

3739
01:02:30,799 --> 01:02:34,230
assumptions in our vision so why why
capture why attack the capture problem

3740
01:02:34,230 --> 01:02:34,240
capture why attack the capture problem
 

3741
01:02:34,240 --> 01:02:35,750
capture why attack the capture problem
which is quite unique in the computer

3742
01:02:35,750 --> 01:02:35,760
which is quite unique in the computer
 

3743
01:02:35,760 --> 01:02:37,670
which is quite unique in the computer

stuff

3754
01:02:45,990 --> 01:02:46,000
stuff
 

3755
01:02:46,000 --> 01:02:48,309
stuff
do you feel like that's uh i mean what

3756
01:02:48,309 --> 01:02:48,319
do you feel like that's uh i mean what
 

3757
01:02:48,319 --> 01:02:49,670
do you feel like that's uh i mean what
what's your thinking about those kinds

3758
01:02:49,670 --> 01:02:49,680
what's your thinking about those kinds
 

3759
01:02:49,680 --> 01:02:50,710
what's your thinking about those kinds
of benchmarks

3760
01:02:50,710 --> 01:02:50,720
of benchmarks
 

3761
01:02:50,720 --> 01:02:53,589
of benchmarks
in um in this in this context i mean

3762
01:02:53,589 --> 01:02:53,599
in um in this in this context i mean
 

3763
01:02:53,599 --> 01:02:55,109
in um in this in this context i mean
those benchmarks are useful

3764
01:02:55,109 --> 01:02:55,119
those benchmarks are useful
 

3765
01:02:55,119 --> 01:02:56,950
those benchmarks are useful
for deep learning kind of algorithms

3766
01:02:56,950 --> 01:02:56,960
for deep learning kind of algorithms
 

3767
01:02:56,960 --> 01:02:58,150
for deep learning kind of algorithms
where you

3768
01:02:58,150 --> 01:02:58,160
where you
 

3769
01:02:58,160 --> 01:03:00,710
where you
you know so the settings uh that deep

3770
01:03:00,710 --> 01:03:00,720
you know so the settings uh that deep
 

3771
01:03:00,720 --> 01:03:01,589
you know so the settings uh that deep
learning works in

3772
01:03:01,589 --> 01:03:01,599
learning works in
 

3773
01:03:01,599 --> 01:03:04,870
learning works in
are here is my huge training set and

3774
01:03:04,870 --> 01:03:04,880
are here is my huge training set and
 

3775
01:03:04,880 --> 01:03:06,470
are here is my huge training set and
here is my test set so the

3776
01:03:06,470 --> 01:03:06,480
here is my test set so the
 

3777
01:03:06,480 --> 01:03:09,109
here is my test set so the
the training set is almost uh you know

3778
01:03:09,109 --> 01:03:09,119
the training set is almost uh you know
 

3779
01:03:09,119 --> 01:03:10,950
the training set is almost uh you know

3783
01:03:14,079 --> 01:03:17,430
uh the test set in many many cases
uh what we wanted to do was invert that

uh what we wanted to do was invert that
 

3785
01:03:17,440 --> 01:03:20,950
uh what we wanted to do was invert that
the training set is way smaller than the

having your model have that property
 

3807
01:03:44,559 --> 01:03:46,789
having your model have that property
then it's it's a good data set to tackle

3808
01:03:46,789 --> 01:03:46,799
then it's it's a good data set to tackle
 

3809
01:03:46,799 --> 01:03:49,510
then it's it's a good data set to tackle
so is there have you attempted to which

3810
01:03:49,510 --> 01:03:49,520
so is there have you attempted to which
 

3811
01:03:49,520 --> 01:03:49,910
so is there have you attempted to which
i think

3812
01:03:49,910 --> 01:03:49,920
i think
 

3813
01:03:49,920 --> 01:03:52,390
i think
i believe there's quite a growing body

01:03:52,390 --> 01:03:52,400
i believe there's quite a growing body
 

3815
01:03:52,400 --> 01:03:53,510
i believe there's quite a growing body

01:03:56,630 --> 01:03:56,640
on looking at mnist and imagenet
 

3819
01:03:56,640 --> 01:03:59,270
on looking at mnist and imagenet
without training so it's like taking

3820
01:03:59,270 --> 01:03:59,280
without training so it's like taking
 

3821
01:03:59,280 --> 01:04:01,510
without training so it's like taking
like the basic challenge is

3822
01:04:01,510 --> 01:04:01,520
like the basic challenge is
 

3823
01:04:01,520 --> 01:04:04,630
like the basic challenge is
how what tiny fraction of the training

3824
01:04:04,630 --> 01:04:04,640
how what tiny fraction of the training
 

3825
01:04:04,640 --> 01:04:07,109
how what tiny fraction of the training
set can we take in order to do

3826
01:04:07,109 --> 01:04:07,119
set can we take in order to do
 

3827
01:04:07,119 --> 01:04:09,990
set can we take in order to do
a reasonable job of the classification

3828
01:04:09,990 --> 01:04:10,000
a reasonable job of the classification
 

3829

task
 

3831
01:04:10,720 --> 01:04:13,670
task
have you explored that angle in these

3832
01:04:13,670 --> 01:04:13,680
have you explored that angle in these
 

3833
01:04:13,680 --> 01:04:14,950
have you explored that angle in these
classic benchmarks

3834
01:04:14,950 --> 01:04:14,960
classic benchmarks
 

3835
01:04:14,960 --> 01:04:17,430
classic benchmarks
yes so so we did do mnist so um you know

3836
01:04:17,430 --> 01:04:17,440
yes so so we did do mnist so um you know
 

3837
01:04:17,440 --> 01:04:19,029
yes so so we did do mnist so um you know
so it's not just capture we

3838
01:04:19,029 --> 01:04:19,039
so it's not just capture we
 

3839
01:04:19,039 --> 01:04:22,230
so it's not just capture we
uh so there was uh also uh

3840
01:04:22,230 --> 01:04:22,240
uh so there was uh also uh
 

3841
01:04:22,240 --> 01:04:24,390
uh so there was uh also uh
uh versions of multiple versions of

3842

uh versions of multiple versions of
 

3843

3846
01:04:27,910 --> 01:04:27,920
the standard version which where we
 

3847
01:04:27,920 --> 01:04:29,430
the standard version which where we
inverted the problem which is basically

3848
01:04:29,430 --> 01:04:29,440
inverted the problem which is basically
 

3849
01:04:29,440 --> 01:04:29,829
inverted the problem which is basically
saying

3850
01:04:29,829 --> 01:04:29,839

uh you know how uh quickly can you
 

3857
01:04:36,240 --> 01:04:38,789
uh you know how uh quickly can you
get uh to high level accuracy with very

is there some performance do you

3862
01:04:41,670 --> 01:04:41,680
is there some performance do you
 

3863
01:04:41,680 --> 01:04:43,510
is there some performance do you
remember like how well

3864
01:04:43,510 --> 01:04:43,520
remember like how well
 

3865
01:04:43,520 --> 01:04:46,470
remember like how well
how well did it do how many examples did

3866
01:04:46,470 --> 01:04:46,480
how well did it do how many examples did
 

3867
01:04:46,480 --> 01:04:47,349
how well did it do how many examples did
he need

01:04:47,349 --> 01:04:47,359
he need
 

3869
01:04:47,359 --> 01:04:51,190
he need
yeah i i you know i remember that it was

3870
01:04:51,190 --> 01:04:51,200
yeah i i you know i remember that it was
 

3871
01:04:51,200 --> 01:04:55,109
yeah i i you know i remember that it was
you know uh on the order of uh

3872
01:04:55,109 --> 01:04:55,119
you know uh on the order of uh
 

3873
01:04:55,119 --> 01:04:57,910
you know uh on the order of uh
tens or hundreds of examples to get into

3874
01:04:57,910 --> 01:04:57,920
tens or hundreds of examples to get into
 

3875
01:04:57,920 --> 01:04:59,029
tens or hundreds of examples to get into
uh 95

3876
01:04:59,029 --> 01:04:59,039
uh 95
 

3877
01:04:59,039 --> 01:05:00,870
uh 95
accuracy and it was it was definitely

3878
01:05:00,870 --> 01:05:00,880
accuracy and it was it was definitely
 

3879
01:05:00,880 --> 01:05:02,630
accuracy and it was it was definitely
better than the systems other systems

3880
01:05:02,630 --> 01:05:02,640
better than the systems other systems
 

3881
01:05:02,640 --> 01:05:03,190
better than the systems other systems
out there

3882
01:05:03,190 --> 01:05:03,200
out there
 

3883
01:05:03,200 --> 01:05:04,950
out there
at that time at that time yeah yeah

3884
01:05:04,950 --> 01:05:04,960
at that time at that time yeah yeah
 

3885
01:05:04,960 --> 01:05:06,309
at that time at that time yeah yeah
they're really pushing i think that's a

3886
01:05:06,309 --> 01:05:06,319
they're really pushing i think that's a
 

3887
01:05:06,319 --> 01:05:06,870
they're really pushing i think that's a
really

3888
01:05:06,870 --> 01:05:06,880
really
 

3889
01:05:06,880 --> 01:05:10,069
really
interesting space actually uh i think

3890
01:05:10,069 --> 01:05:10,079
interesting space actually uh i think
 

3891
01:05:10,079 --> 01:05:13,910
interesting space actually uh i think
there's an actual name for mnist

3892
01:05:13,910 --> 01:05:13,920
there's an actual name for mnist
 

3893
01:05:13,920 --> 01:05:16,870
there's an actual name for mnist
that uh like there's different names the

3894
01:05:16,870 --> 01:05:16,880
that uh like there's different names the
 

3895
01:05:16,880 --> 01:05:17,349
that uh like there's different names the
different

3896
01:05:17,349 --> 01:05:17,359
different
 

3897
01:05:17,359 --> 01:05:19,670
different
sizes of training sets i mean people are

3898
01:05:19,670 --> 01:05:19,680
sizes of training sets i mean people are
 

3899
01:05:19,680 --> 01:05:21,589
sizes of training sets i mean people are
like attacking this problem i think it's

3900
01:05:21,589 --> 01:05:21,599
like attacking this problem i think it's
 

3901
01:05:21,599 --> 01:05:21,990
like attacking this problem i think it's
super

3902
01:05:21,990 --> 01:05:22,000
super
 

3903
01:05:22,000 --> 01:05:24,150
super
interesting yeah it's funny how like

3904
01:05:24,150 --> 01:05:24,160
interesting yeah it's funny how like
 

3905
01:05:24,160 --> 01:05:25,910
interesting yeah it's funny how like
that mnist will probably

3906
01:05:25,910 --> 01:05:25,920
that mnist will probably
 

3907
01:05:25,920 --> 01:05:29,829
that mnist will probably
be with us all the way to agi yes

3908
01:05:29,829 --> 01:05:29,839
be with us all the way to agi yes
 

3909
01:05:29,839 --> 01:05:32,069
be with us all the way to agi yes
it's the data set that just sticks by it

3910
01:05:32,069 --> 01:05:32,079
it's the data set that just sticks by it
 

3911
01:05:32,079 --> 01:05:33,109
it's the data set that just sticks by it
is it's a clean

3912
01:05:33,109 --> 01:05:33,119
is it's a clean
 

3913
01:05:33,119 --> 01:05:36,390
is it's a clean
simple uh data set to uh

3914
01:05:36,390 --> 01:05:36,400
simple uh data set to uh
 

3915
01:05:36,400 --> 01:05:38,069

with just like captures it's interesting

3918
01:05:40,390 --> 01:05:40,400
with just like captures it's interesting
 

3919
01:05:40,400 --> 01:05:43,190
with just like captures it's interesting
not enough people i don't know maybe you

3920
01:05:43,190 --> 01:05:43,200
not enough people i don't know maybe you
 

3921
01:05:43,200 --> 01:05:44,950
not enough people i don't know maybe you
can correct me but i feel like captures

3922
01:05:44,950 --> 01:05:44,960
can correct me but i feel like captures
 

3923
01:05:44,960 --> 01:05:45,829
can correct me but i feel like captures
don't show up

3924
01:05:45,829 --> 01:05:45,839
don't show up
 

3925
01:05:45,839 --> 01:05:47,910
don't show up
as often in papers as they probably

3926
01:05:47,910 --> 01:05:47,920
as often in papers as they probably
 

3927
01:05:47,920 --> 01:05:49,990
as often in papers as they probably
should that's correct yeah because you

3928
01:05:49,990 --> 01:05:50,000
should that's correct yeah because you
 

3929
01:05:50,000 --> 01:05:50,390
should that's correct yeah because you
know

3930
01:05:50,390 --> 01:05:50,400
know
 

3931
01:05:50,400 --> 01:05:53,270
know
um usually these things have a momentum

3932
01:05:53,270 --> 01:05:53,280
um usually these things have a momentum
 

3933
01:05:53,280 --> 01:05:54,630
um usually these things have a momentum
uh you know once

3934
01:05:54,630 --> 01:05:54,640
uh you know once
 

3935
01:05:54,640 --> 01:05:57,829
uh you know once
once uh something gets established as a

3936
01:05:57,829 --> 01:05:57,839
once uh something gets established as a
 

3937
01:05:57,839 --> 01:05:59,750
once uh something gets established as a
standard benchmark yeah there is a

3938
01:05:59,750 --> 01:05:59,760
standard benchmark yeah there is a
 

3939
01:05:59,760 --> 01:06:03,190
standard benchmark yeah there is a
there is a uh there is a dynamics of

3940
01:06:03,190 --> 01:06:03,200
there is a uh there is a dynamics of
 

3941
01:06:03,200 --> 01:06:05,109
there is a uh there is a dynamics of
how graduate students operate and how

3942
01:06:05,109 --> 01:06:05,119
how graduate students operate and how
 

3943
01:06:05,119 --> 01:06:07,349
how graduate students operate and how
the academ academy system works

3944
01:06:07,349 --> 01:06:07,359
the academ academy system works
 

3945
01:06:07,359 --> 01:06:10,230
the academ academy system works
that uh pushes people to track that uh

3946
01:06:10,230 --> 01:06:10,240
that uh pushes people to track that uh
 

3947
01:06:10,240 --> 01:06:12,069
that uh pushes people to track that uh
benchmark so yeah

3948
01:06:12,069 --> 01:06:12,079
benchmark so yeah
 

3949
01:06:12,079 --> 01:06:14,549
benchmark so yeah
yeah so nobody wants to think outside

3950
01:06:14,549 --> 01:06:14,559
yeah so nobody wants to think outside
 

3951
01:06:14,559 --> 01:06:16,710
yeah so nobody wants to think outside
the box okay

3952
01:06:16,710 --> 01:06:16,720
the box okay
 

3953
01:06:16,720 --> 01:06:20,549
the box okay
okay so good performance on the captures

3954
01:06:20,549 --> 01:06:20,559
okay so good performance on the captures
 

3955
01:06:20,559 --> 01:06:22,950
okay so good performance on the captures
what else is there interesting um on the

3956
01:06:22,950 --> 01:06:22,960
what else is there interesting um on the
 

3957
01:06:22,960 --> 01:06:24,789
what else is there interesting um on the
rcn side before we talk about the

3958
01:06:24,789 --> 01:06:24,799
rcn side before we talk about the
 

3959
01:06:24,799 --> 01:06:26,309
rcn side before we talk about the
cortical microscope yeah so

3960
01:06:26,309 --> 01:06:26,319
cortical microscope yeah so
 

3961
01:06:26,319 --> 01:06:29,589
cortical microscope yeah so
the same model so the the the important

3962
01:06:29,589 --> 01:06:29,599
the same model so the the the important
 

3963
01:06:29,599 --> 01:06:31,589
the same model so the the the important
part of the model was that it trains

3964
01:06:31,589 --> 01:06:31,599
part of the model was that it trains
 

3965
01:06:31,599 --> 01:06:33,109
part of the model was that it trains
very quickly with very little training

3966
01:06:33,109 --> 01:06:33,119
very quickly with very little training
 

3967

4104
01:08:50,390 --> 01:08:50,400
in the context of this right um so
 

4105
01:08:50,400 --> 01:08:51,910
in the context of this right um so
if you read the abstract of the paper

4106
01:08:51,910 --> 01:08:51,920
if you read the abstract of the paper
 

4107
01:08:51,920 --> 01:08:53,669
if you read the abstract of the paper
and you know the argument we are putting

4108
01:08:53,669 --> 01:08:53,679
and you know the argument we are putting
 

4109
01:08:53,679 --> 01:08:53,990
and you know the argument we are putting
in

4110
01:08:53,990 --> 01:08:54,000
in
 

4111
01:08:54,000 --> 01:08:55,510
in
you know we are putting in look current

4112
01:08:55,510 --> 01:08:55,520
you know we are putting in look current
 

4113
01:08:55,520 --> 01:08:57,349
you know we are putting in look current
deep learning systems take a lot of

4114
01:08:57,349 --> 01:08:57,359
deep learning systems take a lot of
 

4115
01:08:57,359 --> 01:08:58,309
deep learning systems take a lot of
training data

4116
01:08:58,309 --> 01:08:58,319
training data
 

4117
01:08:58,319 --> 01:09:01,189
training data
uh they don't use these insights and

4118
01:09:01,189 --> 01:09:01,199
uh they don't use these insights and
 

4119
01:09:01,199 --> 01:09:02,390
uh they don't use these insights and
here is our new model

4120
01:09:02,390 --> 01:09:02,400
here is our new model
 

4121
01:09:02,400 --> 01:09:03,829
here is our new model
which is not a deep neural network it's

4122
01:09:03,829 --> 01:09:03,839
which is not a deep neural network it's
 

4123
01:09:03,839 --> 01:09:05,590
which is not a deep neural network it's
a graphical model it does inference this

4124
01:09:05,590 --> 01:09:05,600
a graphical model it does inference this
 

4125
01:09:05,600 --> 01:09:07,349
a graphical model it does inference this
is what how the paper is right

4126
01:09:07,349 --> 01:09:07,359
is what how the paper is right
 

4127
01:09:07,359 --> 01:09:09,349
is what how the paper is right
now once the paper was accepted and

4128
01:09:09,349 --> 01:09:09,359
now once the paper was accepted and
 

4129
01:09:09,359 --> 01:09:10,789
now once the paper was accepted and
everything um

4130
01:09:10,789 --> 01:09:10,799
everything um
 

4131
01:09:10,799 --> 01:09:12,950
everything um
it went to the press department in in

4132
01:09:12,950 --> 01:09:12,960
it went to the press department in in
 

4133
01:09:12,960 --> 01:09:14,470
it went to the press department in in
science you know to play as

4134
01:09:14,470 --> 01:09:14,480
science you know to play as
 

4135
01:09:14,480 --> 01:09:16,070
science you know to play as
science office we we didn't do any press

4136
01:09:16,070 --> 01:09:16,080
science office we we didn't do any press
 

4137
01:09:16,080 --> 01:09:17,749
science office we we didn't do any press
release when it was published it was he

4138
01:09:17,749 --> 01:09:17,759
release when it was published it was he
 

4139
01:09:17,759 --> 01:09:18,950
release when it was published it was he
went to the press department

4140
01:09:18,950 --> 01:09:18,960
went to the press department
 

4141
01:09:18,960 --> 01:09:20,709
went to the press department
what did the what was the press release

4142
01:09:20,709 --> 01:09:20,719
what did the what was the press release
 

4143
01:09:20,719 --> 01:09:22,950
what did the what was the press release
that they wrote up a new deep learning

4144
01:09:22,950 --> 01:09:22,960
that they wrote up a new deep learning
 

4145
01:09:22,960 --> 01:09:24,870
that they wrote up a new deep learning
model

4146
01:09:24,870 --> 01:09:24,880
model
 

4147
01:09:24,880 --> 01:09:28,229
model
solves captchas and uh so

4148
01:09:28,229 --> 01:09:28,239
solves captchas and uh so
 

4149
01:09:28,239 --> 01:09:30,229
solves captchas and uh so
so you can see where was you know what

4150
01:09:30,229 --> 01:09:30,239
so you can see where was you know what
 

4151
01:09:30,239 --> 01:09:32,229
so you can see where was you know what
was being hyped uh in that uh

4152
01:09:32,229 --> 01:09:32,239
was being hyped uh in that uh
 

4153
01:09:32,239 --> 01:09:34,550
was being hyped uh in that uh
thing right so so it's like um there is

4154
01:09:34,550 --> 01:09:34,560
thing right so so it's like um there is
 

4155
01:09:34,560 --> 01:09:35,269
thing right so so it's like um there is
the

4156
01:09:35,269 --> 01:09:35,279
the
 

4157
01:09:35,279 --> 01:09:37,829
the
there is a dynamic in the uh in the

4158
01:09:37,829 --> 01:09:37,839
there is a dynamic in the uh in the
 

4159
01:09:37,839 --> 01:09:39,269
there is a dynamic in the uh in the
community of you know so

4160
01:09:39,269 --> 01:09:39,279
community of you know so
 

4161
01:09:39,279 --> 01:09:42,229
community of you know so
uh um that's especially happens when

4162
01:09:42,229 --> 01:09:42,239
uh um that's especially happens when
 

4163
01:09:42,239 --> 01:09:42,709
uh um that's especially happens when
there are

4164
01:09:42,709 --> 01:09:42,719
there are
 

4165
01:09:42,719 --> 01:09:44,950
there are
lots of new people coming into the field

4166
01:09:44,950 --> 01:09:44,960
lots of new people coming into the field
 

4167
01:09:44,960 --> 01:09:46,789
lots of new people coming into the field
and they get attracted to one thing

4168
01:09:46,789 --> 01:09:46,799
and they get attracted to one thing
 

4169
01:09:46,799 --> 01:09:48,470
and they get attracted to one thing
and some people are trying to think

4170
01:09:48,470 --> 01:09:48,480
and some people are trying to think
 

4171
01:09:48,480 --> 01:09:50,709
and some people are trying to think
different uh compared to that so there's

4172
01:09:50,709 --> 01:09:50,719
different uh compared to that so there's
 

4173
01:09:50,719 --> 01:09:51,669
different uh compared to that so there's
there is some

4174
01:09:51,669 --> 01:09:51,679
there is some
 

4175
01:09:51,679 --> 01:09:53,990
there is some
uh i think skepticism is science is

4176
01:09:53,990 --> 01:09:54,000
uh i think skepticism is science is
 

4177
01:09:54,000 --> 01:09:55,270
uh i think skepticism is science is
important and it is

4178
01:09:55,270 --> 01:09:55,280
important and it is
 

4179
01:09:55,280 --> 01:09:58,310
important and it is
um you know very much uh required

4180
01:09:58,310 --> 01:09:58,320
um you know very much uh required
 

4181
01:09:58,320 --> 01:10:01,189
um you know very much uh required
but it's also it's not uh skepticism

4182
01:10:01,189 --> 01:10:01,199
but it's also it's not uh skepticism
 

4183
01:10:01,199 --> 01:10:03,030
but it's also it's not uh skepticism
usually it's mostly bandwagon effect

4184
01:10:03,030 --> 01:10:03,040
usually it's mostly bandwagon effect
 

4185
01:10:03,040 --> 01:10:03,910
usually it's mostly bandwagon effect
that is happening

4186
01:10:03,910 --> 01:10:03,920
that is happening
 

4187
01:10:03,920 --> 01:10:06,630
that is happening
rather than well but that's not even

4188
01:10:06,630 --> 01:10:06,640
rather than well but that's not even
 

4189
01:10:06,640 --> 01:10:07,270
rather than well but that's not even
that i mean

4190
01:10:07,270 --> 01:10:07,280
that i mean
 

4191
01:10:07,280 --> 01:10:09,350
that i mean
i'll tell you what they react to which

4192
01:10:09,350 --> 01:10:09,360
i'll tell you what they react to which
 

4193
01:10:09,360 --> 01:10:10,550
i'll tell you what they react to which
is like

4194
01:10:10,550 --> 01:10:10,560
is like
 

4195
01:10:10,560 --> 01:10:12,790
is like
i'm sensitive to as well if you if you

4196
01:10:12,790 --> 01:10:12,800
i'm sensitive to as well if you if you
 

4197
01:10:12,800 --> 01:10:15,350
i'm sensitive to as well if you if you
look at just companies open ai deep mind

4198
01:10:15,350 --> 01:10:15,360
look at just companies open ai deep mind
 

4199
01:10:15,360 --> 01:10:18,870
look at just companies open ai deep mind
yeah um vicarious i mean it just

4200
01:10:18,870 --> 01:10:18,880
yeah um vicarious i mean it just
 

4201
01:10:18,880 --> 01:10:21,750
yeah um vicarious i mean it just
there's uh there's a little bit of a

4202
01:10:21,750 --> 01:10:21,760
there's uh there's a little bit of a
 

4203
01:10:21,760 --> 01:10:23,189
there's uh there's a little bit of a
race

4204
01:10:23,189 --> 01:10:23,199
race
 

4205
01:10:23,199 --> 01:10:25,910
race
to the top and hype right right it's

4206
01:10:25,910 --> 01:10:25,920
to the top and hype right right it's
 

4207
01:10:25,920 --> 01:10:27,110
to the top and hype right right it's
it's like

4208
01:10:27,110 --> 01:10:27,120
it's like
 

4209
01:10:27,120 --> 01:10:31,830
it's like
it doesn't pay off to be humble

4210
01:10:31,830 --> 01:10:31,840
it doesn't pay off to be humble
 

4211
01:10:31,840 --> 01:10:35,110
it doesn't pay off to be humble
so like uh and and the press is just

4212
01:10:35,110 --> 01:10:35,120
so like uh and and the press is just
 

4213
01:10:35,120 --> 01:10:37,830
so like uh and and the press is just
uh irresponsible often they they just i

4214
01:10:37,830 --> 01:10:37,840
uh irresponsible often they they just i
 

4215
01:10:37,840 --> 01:10:39,430
uh irresponsible often they they just i
mean don't get me started on

4216
01:10:39,430 --> 01:10:39,440
mean don't get me started on
 

4217
01:10:39,440 --> 01:10:41,669
mean don't get me started on
the state of journalism today like it

4218
01:10:41,669 --> 01:10:41,679
the state of journalism today like it
 

4219
01:10:41,679 --> 01:10:43,430
the state of journalism today like it
seems like the people who write articles

4220
01:10:43,430 --> 01:10:43,440
seems like the people who write articles
 

4221
01:10:43,440 --> 01:10:43,990
seems like the people who write articles
about these

4222
01:10:43,990 --> 01:10:44,000
about these
 

4223
01:10:44,000 --> 01:10:47,110
about these
things they literally have not even

4224
01:10:47,110 --> 01:10:47,120
things they literally have not even
 

4225
01:10:47,120 --> 01:10:49,430
things they literally have not even
spent an hour on the wikipedia article

4226
01:10:49,430 --> 01:10:49,440
spent an hour on the wikipedia article
 

4227
01:10:49,440 --> 01:10:50,310
spent an hour on the wikipedia article
about what is

4228
01:10:50,310 --> 01:10:50,320
about what is
 

4229
01:10:50,320 --> 01:10:52,229
about what is
neural networks like yeah they haven't

4230
01:10:52,229 --> 01:10:52,239
neural networks like yeah they haven't
 

4231
01:10:52,239 --> 01:10:53,430
neural networks like yeah they haven't
like invested

4232
01:10:53,430 --> 01:10:53,440
like invested
 

4233
01:10:53,440 --> 01:10:56,870
like invested
just even the language to laziness

4234
01:10:56,870 --> 01:10:56,880
just even the language to laziness
 

4235
01:10:56,880 --> 01:11:00,870
just even the language to laziness
it's like uh robots

4236
01:11:00,870 --> 01:11:00,880
it's like uh robots
 

4237
01:11:00,880 --> 01:11:04,070
it's like uh robots
beat humans like they they write this

4238
01:11:04,070 --> 01:11:04,080
beat humans like they they write this
 

4239
01:11:04,080 --> 01:11:04,870
beat humans like they they write this
kind of stuff

4240
01:11:04,870 --> 01:11:04,880
kind of stuff
 

4241
01:11:04,880 --> 01:11:07,430
kind of stuff
that just uh and then and then of course

4242
01:11:07,430 --> 01:11:07,440
that just uh and then and then of course
 

4243
01:11:07,440 --> 01:11:08,470
that just uh and then and then of course
the researchers are

4244
01:11:08,470 --> 01:11:08,480
the researchers are
 

4245
01:11:08,480 --> 01:11:11,189
the researchers are
quite sensitive to that because it gets

4246
01:11:11,189 --> 01:11:11,199
quite sensitive to that because it gets
 

4247
01:11:11,199 --> 01:11:12,070
quite sensitive to that because it gets
a lot of attention

4248
01:11:12,070 --> 01:11:12,080
a lot of attention
 

4249
01:11:12,080 --> 01:11:13,750
a lot of attention
they're like why did this work get so

4250
01:11:13,750 --> 01:11:13,760
they're like why did this work get so
 

4251
01:11:13,760 --> 01:11:15,110
they're like why did this work get so
much attention

4252
01:11:15,110 --> 01:11:15,120
much attention
 

4253
01:11:15,120 --> 01:11:17,590
much attention
uh you know that's that's over the top

4254
01:11:17,590 --> 01:11:17,600
uh you know that's that's over the top
 

4255
01:11:17,600 --> 01:11:19,189
uh you know that's that's over the top
and people get really sensitive you know

4256
01:11:19,189 --> 01:11:19,199
and people get really sensitive you know
 

4257
01:11:19,199 --> 01:11:21,350
and people get really sensitive you know
the same kind of criticism with uh

4258
01:11:21,350 --> 01:11:21,360
the same kind of criticism with uh
 

4259
01:11:21,360 --> 01:11:23,750
the same kind of criticism with uh
opening i did work with the rubik's cube

4260
01:11:23,750 --> 01:11:23,760
opening i did work with the rubik's cube
 

4261
01:11:23,760 --> 01:11:26,149
opening i did work with the rubik's cube
with the robot that people criticized

4262
01:11:26,149 --> 01:11:26,159
with the robot that people criticized
 

4263
01:11:26,159 --> 01:11:28,790
with the robot that people criticized
uh same with gpt two and three they

4264
01:11:28,790 --> 01:11:28,800
uh same with gpt two and three they
 

4265
01:11:28,800 --> 01:11:29,669
uh same with gpt two and three they
criticize

4266
01:11:29,669 --> 01:11:29,679
criticize
 

4267
01:11:29,679 --> 01:11:32,950
criticize
uh same thing with the deep minds with

4268
01:11:32,950 --> 01:11:32,960
uh same thing with the deep minds with
 

4269
01:11:32,960 --> 01:11:34,550
uh same thing with the deep minds with
alpha zero i mean

4270
01:11:34,550 --> 01:11:34,560
alpha zero i mean
 

4271
01:11:34,560 --> 01:11:38,070
alpha zero i mean
yeah i i'm sensitive to it but

4272
01:11:38,070 --> 01:11:38,080
yeah i i'm sensitive to it but
 

4273
01:11:38,080 --> 01:11:39,189
yeah i i'm sensitive to it but
and of course with your work you

4274
01:11:39,189 --> 01:11:39,199
and of course with your work you
 

4275
01:11:39,199 --> 01:11:41,030
and of course with your work you
mentioned deep learning but there's

4276
01:11:41,030 --> 01:11:41,040
mentioned deep learning but there's
 

4277
01:11:41,040 --> 01:11:42,870
mentioned deep learning but there's
something super sexy to the

4278
01:11:42,870 --> 01:11:42,880
something super sexy to the
 

4279
01:11:42,880 --> 01:11:45,990
something super sexy to the
public about brain inspired i mean that

4280
01:11:45,990 --> 01:11:46,000
public about brain inspired i mean that
 

4281
01:11:46,000 --> 01:11:48,390
public about brain inspired i mean that
immediately grabs people's imagination

4282
01:11:48,390 --> 01:11:48,400
immediately grabs people's imagination
 

4283
01:11:48,400 --> 01:11:50,070
immediately grabs people's imagination
not even like

4284
01:11:50,070 --> 01:11:50,080
not even like
 

4285
01:11:50,080 --> 01:11:52,870
not even like
neural networks but like really brain

4286
01:11:52,870 --> 01:11:52,880
neural networks but like really brain
 

4287
01:11:52,880 --> 01:11:54,630
neural networks but like really brain
inspired like

4288
01:11:54,630 --> 01:11:54,640
inspired like
 

4289
01:11:54,640 --> 01:11:57,750
inspired like
like brain like neural networks that

4290
01:11:57,750 --> 01:11:57,760
like brain like neural networks that
 

4291
01:11:57,760 --> 01:11:58,310
like brain like neural networks that
seems

4292
01:11:58,310 --> 01:11:58,320
seems
 

4293
01:11:58,320 --> 01:12:00,790
seems
really compelling to people and um to me

4294
01:12:00,790 --> 01:12:00,800
really compelling to people and um to me
 

4295
01:12:00,800 --> 01:12:01,590
really compelling to people and um to me
as well to

4296
01:12:01,590 --> 01:12:01,600
as well to
 

4297
01:12:01,600 --> 01:12:04,709
as well to
to the world as a narrative and so uh

4298
01:12:04,709 --> 01:12:04,719
to the world as a narrative and so uh
 

4299
01:12:04,719 --> 01:12:08,870
to the world as a narrative and so uh
people hook up hook on to that and uh

4300
01:12:08,870 --> 01:12:08,880
people hook up hook on to that and uh
 

4301
01:12:08,880 --> 01:12:11,590
people hook up hook on to that and uh
sometimes you uh the skepticism engine

4302
01:12:11,590 --> 01:12:11,600
sometimes you uh the skepticism engine
 

4303
01:12:11,600 --> 01:12:13,669
sometimes you uh the skepticism engine
turns on in the research community and

4304
01:12:13,669 --> 01:12:13,679
turns on in the research community and
 

4305
01:12:13,679 --> 01:12:14,390
turns on in the research community and
they're

4306
01:12:14,390 --> 01:12:14,400
they're
 

4307
01:12:14,400 --> 01:12:18,149
they're
skeptical but i think putting aside

4308
01:12:18,149 --> 01:12:18,159
skeptical but i think putting aside
 

4309
01:12:18,159 --> 01:12:20,229
skeptical but i think putting aside
the ideas of the actual performance on

4310
01:12:20,229 --> 01:12:20,239
the ideas of the actual performance on
 

4311
01:12:20,239 --> 01:12:22,790
the ideas of the actual performance on
captures or performance in any data set

4312
01:12:22,790 --> 01:12:22,800
captures or performance in any data set
 

4313
01:12:22,800 --> 01:12:25,830
captures or performance in any data set
i mean to me all these data sets are

4314
01:12:25,830 --> 01:12:25,840
i mean to me all these data sets are
 

4315
01:12:25,840 --> 01:12:28,550
i mean to me all these data sets are
useless anyway it's nice to have them

4316
01:12:28,550 --> 01:12:28,560
useless anyway it's nice to have them
 

4317
01:12:28,560 --> 01:12:30,070
useless anyway it's nice to have them
but in the grand scheme of things

4318
01:12:30,070 --> 01:12:30,080
but in the grand scheme of things
 

4319
01:12:30,080 --> 01:12:32,070
but in the grand scheme of things
they're silly toy examples

4320
01:12:32,070 --> 01:12:32,080
they're silly toy examples
 

4321
01:12:32,080 --> 01:12:35,669
they're silly toy examples
the point is is their intuition about

4322
01:12:35,669 --> 01:12:35,679
the point is is their intuition about
 

4323
01:12:35,679 --> 01:12:38,470
the point is is their intuition about
the the ideas just like you mentioned

4324
01:12:38,470 --> 01:12:38,480
the the ideas just like you mentioned
 

4325
01:12:38,480 --> 01:12:39,669
the the ideas just like you mentioned
bringing the ideas

4326
01:12:39,669 --> 01:12:39,679
bringing the ideas
 

4327
01:12:39,679 --> 01:12:41,910
bringing the ideas
together in a unique way is there

4328
01:12:41,910 --> 01:12:41,920
together in a unique way is there
 

4329
01:12:41,920 --> 01:12:43,590
together in a unique way is there
something there is there some value

4330
01:12:43,590 --> 01:12:43,600
something there is there some value
 

4331
01:12:43,600 --> 01:12:43,990
something there is there some value
there

4332
01:12:43,990 --> 01:12:44,000
there
 

4333
01:12:44,000 --> 01:12:45,430
there
and this is going to stand the test of

4334
01:12:45,430 --> 01:12:45,440
and this is going to stand the test of
 

4335
01:12:45,440 --> 01:12:47,110
and this is going to stand the test of
time yes and that's the hope

4336
01:12:47,110 --> 01:12:47,120
time yes and that's the hope
 

4337
01:12:47,120 --> 01:12:50,070
time yes and that's the hope
that's the hope i'm my confidence there

4338
01:12:50,070 --> 01:12:50,080
that's the hope i'm my confidence there
 

4339
01:12:50,080 --> 01:12:51,030
that's the hope i'm my confidence there
is very high

4340
01:12:51,030 --> 01:12:51,040
is very high
 

4341
01:12:51,040 --> 01:12:53,830
is very high
i you know i don't treat brain inspect

4342
01:12:53,830 --> 01:12:53,840
i you know i don't treat brain inspect
 

4343
01:12:53,840 --> 01:12:55,270
i you know i don't treat brain inspect
as a marketing term

4344
01:12:55,270 --> 01:12:55,280
as a marketing term
 

4345
01:12:55,280 --> 01:12:58,310
as a marketing term
uh you know i am looking into the

4346
01:12:58,310 --> 01:12:58,320
uh you know i am looking into the
 

4347
01:12:58,320 --> 01:12:58,950
uh you know i am looking into the
details

4348
01:12:58,950 --> 01:12:58,960
details
 

4349
01:12:58,960 --> 01:13:02,229
details
of biology and i'm puzzling over

4350
01:13:02,229 --> 01:13:02,239
of biology and i'm puzzling over
 

4351
01:13:02,239 --> 01:13:04,870
of biology and i'm puzzling over
uh those things and i am i am grappling

4352
01:13:04,870 --> 01:13:04,880
uh those things and i am i am grappling
 

4353
01:13:04,880 --> 01:13:06,149
uh those things and i am i am grappling
with those things and

4354
01:13:06,149 --> 01:13:06,159
with those things and
 

4355
01:13:06,159 --> 01:13:08,310
with those things and
so this it is not a marketing term at

4356
01:13:08,310 --> 01:13:08,320
so this it is not a marketing term at
 

4357
01:13:08,320 --> 01:13:09,669
so this it is not a marketing term at
all it you know you can use it as a

4358
01:13:09,669 --> 01:13:09,679
all it you know you can use it as a
 

4359
01:13:09,679 --> 01:13:10,709
all it you know you can use it as a
marketing term and

4360
01:13:10,709 --> 01:13:10,719
marketing term and
 

4361
01:13:10,719 --> 01:13:13,669
marketing term and
and people often use it and you can get

4362
01:13:13,669 --> 01:13:13,679
and people often use it and you can get
 

4363
01:13:13,679 --> 01:13:14,950
and people often use it and you can get
combined with them and when

4364
01:13:14,950 --> 01:13:14,960
combined with them and when
 

4365
01:13:14,960 --> 01:13:17,030
combined with them and when
when people don't understand how we are

4366
01:13:17,030 --> 01:13:17,040
when people don't understand how we are
 

4367
01:13:17,040 --> 01:13:18,070
when people don't understand how we are
approaching the problem

4368
01:13:18,070 --> 01:13:18,080
approaching the problem
 

4369
01:13:18,080 --> 01:13:21,270
approaching the problem
it is it is easy to be uh misunderstood

4370
01:13:21,270 --> 01:13:21,280
it is it is easy to be uh misunderstood
 

4371
01:13:21,280 --> 01:13:21,590
it is it is easy to be uh misunderstood
and

4372
01:13:21,590 --> 01:13:21,600
and
 

4373
01:13:21,600 --> 01:13:23,510
and
you know think of it as you know purely

4374
01:13:23,510 --> 01:13:23,520
you know think of it as you know purely
 

4375
01:13:23,520 --> 01:13:25,270
you know think of it as you know purely
uh marketing but that's not the way

4376
01:13:25,270 --> 01:13:25,280
uh marketing but that's not the way
 

4377
01:13:25,280 --> 01:13:28,790
uh marketing but that's not the way
uh we are so you really i mean as a

4378
01:13:28,790 --> 01:13:28,800
uh we are so you really i mean as a
 

4379
01:13:28,800 --> 01:13:30,070
uh we are so you really i mean as a
scientist

4380
01:13:30,070 --> 01:13:30,080
scientist
 

4381
01:13:30,080 --> 01:13:32,630
scientist
you believe that if we kind of just

4382
01:13:32,630 --> 01:13:32,640
you believe that if we kind of just
 

4383
01:13:32,640 --> 01:13:33,510
you believe that if we kind of just
stick to

4384
01:13:33,510 --> 01:13:33,520
stick to
 

4385
01:13:33,520 --> 01:13:35,669
stick to
really understanding the brain that's

4386
01:13:35,669 --> 01:13:35,679
really understanding the brain that's
 

4387
01:13:35,679 --> 01:13:36,709
really understanding the brain that's
going to

4388
01:13:36,709 --> 01:13:36,719
going to
 

4389
01:13:36,719 --> 01:13:38,310
going to
that's the right like you should

4390
01:13:38,310 --> 01:13:38,320
that's the right like you should
 

4391
01:13:38,320 --> 01:13:40,790
that's the right like you should
constantly meditate on the

4392
01:13:40,790 --> 01:13:40,800
constantly meditate on the
 

4393
01:13:40,800 --> 01:13:42,630
constantly meditate on the
how does the brain do this because

4394
01:13:42,630 --> 01:13:42,640
how does the brain do this because
 

4395
01:13:42,640 --> 01:13:44,310
how does the brain do this because
that's going to be really helpful for

4396
01:13:44,310 --> 01:13:44,320
that's going to be really helpful for
 

4397
01:13:44,320 --> 01:13:46,470
that's going to be really helpful for
engineering intelligent systems

4398
01:13:46,470 --> 01:13:46,480
engineering intelligent systems
 

4399
01:13:46,480 --> 01:13:49,030

yes you need to so i think it is it's

4400
01:13:49,030 --> 01:13:49,040
yes you need to so i think it is it's
 

4401
01:13:49,040 --> 01:13:51,270
yes you need to so i think it is it's
one input and it is it is helpful

4402
01:13:51,270 --> 01:13:51,280
one input and it is it is helpful
 

4403
01:13:51,280 --> 01:13:54,709
one input and it is it is helpful
but you you should know when to deviate

4404
01:13:54,709 --> 01:13:54,719
but you you should know when to deviate
 

4405
01:13:54,719 --> 01:13:55,270
but you you should know when to deviate
from it

4406
01:13:55,270 --> 01:13:55,280
from it
 

4407
01:13:55,280 --> 01:13:58,310
from it
too um so an example is convolutional

01:14:14,960 --> 01:14:18,709
is no
translation in in variance in the um

4428
01:14:18,709 --> 01:14:18,719
translation in in variance in the um
 

4429
01:14:18,719 --> 01:14:21,990
translation in in variance in the um
uh the network weights um in in the

4430
01:14:21,990 --> 01:14:22,000
uh the network weights um in in the
 

4431
01:14:22,000 --> 01:14:23,750
uh the network weights um in in the
visual cortex that is a

4432
01:14:23,750 --> 01:14:23,760
visual cortex that is a
 

4433
01:14:23,760 --> 01:14:26,229
visual cortex that is a
a computational trick which is a very

4434
01:14:26,229 --> 01:14:26,239
a computational trick which is a very
 

4435
01:14:26,239 --> 01:14:28,070
a computational trick which is a very
good engineering trick that we use

4436
01:14:28,070 --> 01:14:28,080
good engineering trick that we use
 

4437
01:14:28,080 --> 01:14:30,070
good engineering trick that we use
for sharing the training between the

4438
01:14:30,070 --> 01:14:30,080
for sharing the training between the
 

4439
01:14:30,080 --> 01:14:31,430
for sharing the training between the
different uh nodes

4440
01:14:31,430 --> 01:14:31,440
different uh nodes
 

4441
01:14:31,440 --> 01:14:34,790
different uh nodes
um so and and that trick will be with us

4442
01:14:34,790 --> 01:14:34,800
um so and and that trick will be with us
 

4443
01:14:34,800 --> 01:14:36,709
um so and and that trick will be with us
for some time it will go away when

4444
01:14:36,709 --> 01:14:36,719
for some time it will go away when
 

4445
01:14:36,719 --> 01:14:40,470
for some time it will go away when
we have um

4446
01:14:40,470 --> 01:14:40,480

 

4447
01:14:40,480 --> 01:14:43,350

robots with eyes and heads that move uh

4448
01:14:43,350 --> 01:14:43,360
robots with eyes and heads that move uh
 

4449
01:14:43,360 --> 01:14:43,750
robots with eyes and heads that move uh
and

4450
01:14:43,750 --> 01:14:43,760
and
 

4451
01:14:43,760 --> 01:14:45,669
and
so then that trick will go away it will

4452
01:14:45,669 --> 01:14:45,679
so then that trick will go away it will
 

4453
01:14:45,679 --> 01:14:47,910
so then that trick will go away it will
not be uh useful at that time

4454
01:14:47,910 --> 01:14:47,920
not be uh useful at that time
 

4455
01:14:47,920 --> 01:14:50,870
not be uh useful at that time
so so the brain doesn't so the brain

4456
01:14:50,870 --> 01:14:50,880
so so the brain doesn't so the brain
 

4457
01:14:50,880 --> 01:14:52,950
so so the brain doesn't so the brain
doesn't have translational invariance

4458
01:14:52,950 --> 01:14:52,960
doesn't have translational invariance
 

4459
01:14:52,960 --> 01:14:54,709
doesn't have translational invariance
it has the focal point like it has a

4460
01:14:54,709 --> 01:14:54,719
it has the focal point like it has a
 

4461
01:14:54,719 --> 01:14:56,709
it has the focal point like it has a
thing it focuses on correct it does it

4462
01:14:56,709 --> 01:14:56,719
thing it focuses on correct it does it
 

4463
01:14:56,719 --> 01:14:57,590
thing it focuses on correct it does it
has a phobia

4464
01:14:57,590 --> 01:14:57,600
has a phobia
 

4465
01:14:57,600 --> 01:15:00,550
has a phobia
and and because of the phobia um the

4466
01:15:00,550 --> 01:15:00,560
and and because of the phobia um the
 

4467
01:15:00,560 --> 01:15:02,229
and and because of the phobia um the
receptive fields are not

4468
01:15:02,229 --> 01:15:02,239
receptive fields are not
 

4469
01:15:02,239 --> 01:15:04,790
receptive fields are not
like the copying of the weights like the

4470
01:15:04,790 --> 01:15:04,800
like the copying of the weights like the
 

4471
01:15:04,800 --> 01:15:06,310
like the copying of the weights like the
the weights in the center are very

4472
01:15:06,310 --> 01:15:06,320
the weights in the center are very
 

4473
01:15:06,320 --> 01:15:07,110
the weights in the center are very
different from the weights in the

4474
01:15:07,110 --> 01:15:07,120
different from the weights in the
 

4475
01:15:07,120 --> 01:15:07,750
different from the weights in the
periphery

4476
01:15:07,750 --> 01:15:07,760
periphery
 

4477
01:15:07,760 --> 01:15:09,830
periphery
yes at the periphery i mean i did this

4478
01:15:09,830 --> 01:15:09,840
yes at the periphery i mean i did this
 

4479
01:15:09,840 --> 01:15:10,870
yes at the periphery i mean i did this
uh

4480
01:15:10,870 --> 01:15:10,880
uh
 

4481
01:15:10,880 --> 01:15:13,189
uh
actually wrote a paper and just gotten

4482
01:15:13,189 --> 01:15:13,199
actually wrote a paper and just gotten
 

4483
01:15:13,199 --> 01:15:15,350
actually wrote a paper and just gotten
the chance to really study peripheral

4484
01:15:15,350 --> 01:15:15,360
the chance to really study peripheral
 

4485
01:15:15,360 --> 01:15:18,229
the chance to really study peripheral
peripheral vision which is a fascinating

4486
01:15:18,229 --> 01:15:18,239
peripheral vision which is a fascinating
 

4487
01:15:18,239 --> 01:15:19,189
peripheral vision which is a fascinating
thing

4488
01:15:19,189 --> 01:15:19,199
thing
 

4489
01:15:19,199 --> 01:15:22,870
thing
very under understood thing

4490
01:15:22,870 --> 01:15:22,880
very under understood thing
 

4491
01:15:22,880 --> 01:15:25,030
very under understood thing
of what the br you know at the every

4492
01:15:25,030 --> 01:15:25,040
of what the br you know at the every
 

4493
01:15:25,040 --> 01:15:27,030
of what the br you know at the every
level the brain does

4494
01:15:27,030 --> 01:15:27,040
level the brain does
 

4495
01:15:27,040 --> 01:15:28,950
level the brain does
with the periphery it does some funky

4496
01:15:28,950 --> 01:15:28,960
with the periphery it does some funky
 

4497
01:15:28,960 --> 01:15:30,310
with the periphery it does some funky
stuff yeah so it's uh

4498
01:15:30,310 --> 01:15:30,320
stuff yeah so it's uh
 

4499
01:15:30,320 --> 01:15:33,590
stuff yeah so it's uh
it's another kind of trick than

4500
01:15:33,590 --> 01:15:33,600
it's another kind of trick than
 

4501
01:15:33,600 --> 01:15:36,709
it's another kind of trick than
uh convolutional like it does it

4502
01:15:36,709 --> 01:15:36,719
uh convolutional like it does it
 

4503
01:15:36,719 --> 01:15:39,990
uh convolutional like it does it
it uh it's a you know convolutional

4504
01:15:39,990 --> 01:15:40,000
it uh it's a you know convolutional
 

4505
01:15:40,000 --> 01:15:42,070
it uh it's a you know convolutional
convolution in neural networks is a

4506
01:15:42,070 --> 01:15:42,080
convolution in neural networks is a
 

4507
01:15:42,080 --> 01:15:43,669
convolution in neural networks is a
trick to for efficiency

4508
01:15:43,669 --> 01:15:43,679
trick to for efficiency
 

4509
01:15:43,679 --> 01:15:46,070
trick to for efficiency
is efficiency trick and the brain does a

4510
01:15:46,070 --> 01:15:46,080
is efficiency trick and the brain does a
 

4511
01:15:46,080 --> 01:15:47,669
is efficiency trick and the brain does a
whole another kind of thing yeah yes got

4512
01:15:47,669 --> 01:15:47,679
whole another kind of thing yeah yes got
 

4513
01:15:47,679 --> 01:15:47,910
whole another kind of thing yeah yes got
it

4514
01:15:47,910 --> 01:15:47,920
it
 

4515
01:15:47,920 --> 01:15:49,750
it
so so you need to understand the

4516
01:15:49,750 --> 01:15:49,760
so so you need to understand the
 

4517
01:15:49,760 --> 01:15:51,110
so so you need to understand the
principles

4518
01:15:51,110 --> 01:15:51,120
principles
 

4519
01:15:51,120 --> 01:15:53,750
principles
or processing so that you can still

4520
01:15:53,750 --> 01:15:53,760
or processing so that you can still
 

4521
01:15:53,760 --> 01:15:54,310
or processing so that you can still
apply

4522
01:15:54,310 --> 01:15:54,320
apply
 

4523
01:15:54,320 --> 01:15:56,070
apply
engineering tricks yeah when where you

4524
01:15:56,070 --> 01:15:56,080
engineering tricks yeah when where you
 

4525
01:15:56,080 --> 01:15:57,189
engineering tricks yeah when where you
want to do you don't want to be

4526
01:15:57,189 --> 01:15:57,199
want to do you don't want to be
 

4527
01:15:57,199 --> 01:15:58,390
want to do you don't want to be
slavishly making

4528
01:15:58,390 --> 01:15:58,400
slavishly making
 

4529
01:15:58,400 --> 01:16:00,950
slavishly making
all the things of the brain um and and

4530
01:16:00,950 --> 01:16:00,960
all the things of the brain um and and
 

4531
01:16:00,960 --> 01:16:02,790
all the things of the brain um and and
so yeah so it should be one input and i

4532
01:16:02,790 --> 01:16:02,800
so yeah so it should be one input and i
 

4533
01:16:02,800 --> 01:16:03,430
so yeah so it should be one input and i
think it is

4534
01:16:03,430 --> 01:16:03,440
think it is
 

4535
01:16:03,440 --> 01:16:06,550
think it is
extremely helpful uh but you it should

4536
01:16:06,550 --> 01:16:06,560
extremely helpful uh but you it should
 

4537
01:16:06,560 --> 01:16:07,510
extremely helpful uh but you it should
be the point of

4538
01:16:07,510 --> 01:16:07,520
be the point of
 

4539
01:16:07,520 --> 01:16:08,950
be the point of
really understanding so that you know

4540
01:16:08,950 --> 01:16:08,960
really understanding so that you know
 

4541
01:16:08,960 --> 01:16:10,790
really understanding so that you know
when to deviate from it

4542
01:16:10,790 --> 01:16:10,800
when to deviate from it
 

4543
01:16:10,800 --> 01:16:13,510
when to deviate from it
so okay that's really cool that that's

4544
01:16:13,510 --> 01:16:13,520
so okay that's really cool that that's
 

4545
01:16:13,520 --> 01:16:14,070
so okay that's really cool that that's
work from

4546
01:16:14,070 --> 01:16:14,080
work from
 

4547
01:16:14,080 --> 01:16:17,590
work from
a few years ago so you'd uh you did work

4548
01:16:17,590 --> 01:16:17,600
a few years ago so you'd uh you did work
 

4549
01:16:17,600 --> 01:16:19,270
a few years ago so you'd uh you did work
in jumento with jeff hawkins

4550
01:16:19,270 --> 01:16:19,280
in jumento with jeff hawkins
 

4551
01:16:19,280 --> 01:16:22,470
in jumento with jeff hawkins
yeah uh with uh hierarchical temporal

4552
01:16:22,470 --> 01:16:22,480
yeah uh with uh hierarchical temporal
 

4553
01:16:22,480 --> 01:16:23,270
yeah uh with uh hierarchical temporal

4555
01:16:23,280 --> 01:16:26,149

how is your just if you could give a

4556
01:16:26,149 --> 01:16:26,159
how is your just if you could give a
 

4557
01:16:26,159 --> 01:16:27,270
how is your just if you could give a
brief history

4558
01:16:27,270 --> 01:16:27,280
brief history
 

4559
01:16:27,280 --> 01:16:30,630
brief history
how is your view of the way the models

4560
01:16:30,630 --> 01:16:30,640
how is your view of the way the models
 

4561
01:16:30,640 --> 01:16:33,270
how is your view of the way the models
of the brain changed over the past

4562
01:16:33,270 --> 01:16:33,280
of the brain changed over the past
 

4563
01:16:33,280 --> 01:16:35,910
of the brain changed over the past
few years leading up to to now is there

4564
01:16:35,910 --> 01:16:35,920
few years leading up to to now is there
 

4565
01:16:35,920 --> 01:16:38,470
few years leading up to to now is there
some interesting aspects where

4566
01:16:38,470 --> 01:16:38,480
some interesting aspects where
 

4567
01:16:38,480 --> 01:16:40,550
some interesting aspects where
there is an adjustment to your

4568
01:16:40,550 --> 01:16:40,560
there is an adjustment to your
 

4569
01:16:40,560 --> 01:16:42,070
there is an adjustment to your
understanding of the brain or is it all

4570
01:16:42,070 --> 01:16:42,080
understanding of the brain or is it all
 

4571
01:16:42,080 --> 01:16:43,910
understanding of the brain or is it all
just building on top of each other

4572
01:16:43,910 --> 01:16:43,920
just building on top of each other
 

4573
01:16:43,920 --> 01:16:46,950
just building on top of each other
in terms of the higher level ideas

4574
01:16:46,950 --> 01:16:46,960
in terms of the higher level ideas
 

4575
01:16:46,960 --> 01:16:48,709
in terms of the higher level ideas
especially the ones jeff wrote about in

4576
01:16:48,709 --> 01:16:48,719
especially the ones jeff wrote about in
 

4577
01:16:48,719 --> 01:16:50,310

uh things are i would say consistent

4590
01:17:00,709 --> 01:17:00,719
uh things are i would say consistent
 

4591
01:17:00,719 --> 01:17:02,630
uh things are i would say consistent
with what he wrote about but

4592
01:17:02,630 --> 01:17:02,640
with what he wrote about but
 

4593
01:17:02,640 --> 01:17:04,070
with what he wrote about but
but many things will be consistent with

4594
01:17:04,070 --> 01:17:04,080
but many things will be consistent with
 

4595
01:17:04,080 --> 01:17:05,430
but many things will be consistent with
that because it is it's a blur you know

4596
01:17:05,430 --> 01:17:05,440
that because it is it's a blur you know
 

4597
01:17:05,440 --> 01:17:06,550
that because it is it's a blur you know
when you when you

4598
01:17:06,550 --> 01:17:06,560
when you when you
 

4599
01:17:06,560 --> 01:17:08,950
when you when you
you know deep learning systems are also

4600
01:17:08,950 --> 01:17:08,960
you know deep learning systems are also
 

4601
01:17:08,960 --> 01:17:10,709
you know deep learning systems are also
you know multi-level hierarchical

4602
01:17:10,709 --> 01:17:10,719
you know multi-level hierarchical
 

4603
01:17:10,719 --> 01:17:13,510
you know multi-level hierarchical
all of those things right so so at the

4604
01:17:13,510 --> 01:17:13,520
all of those things right so so at the
 

4605
01:17:13,520 --> 01:17:14,229
all of those things right so so at the
but

4606
01:17:14,229 --> 01:17:14,239
but
 

4607
01:17:14,239 --> 01:17:17,270
but
um in terms of the detail a lot of

4608
01:17:17,270 --> 01:17:17,280
um in terms of the detail a lot of
 

4609
01:17:17,280 --> 01:17:18,149
um in terms of the detail a lot of
things are different

4610
01:17:18,149 --> 01:17:18,159
things are different
 

4611
01:17:18,159 --> 01:17:21,030
things are different
uh and and and those details matter a

4612
01:17:21,030 --> 01:17:21,040
uh and and and those details matter a
 

4613
01:17:21,040 --> 01:17:21,430
uh and and and those details matter a
lot

4614
01:17:21,430 --> 01:17:21,440
lot
 

4615
01:17:21,440 --> 01:17:25,030
lot
um so so one point of difference i had

4616
01:17:25,030 --> 01:17:25,040
um so so one point of difference i had
 

4617
01:17:25,040 --> 01:17:25,830
um so so one point of difference i had
with jeff

4618
01:17:25,830 --> 01:17:25,840
with jeff
 

4619
01:17:25,840 --> 01:17:29,270
with jeff
uh uh was uh how to approach

4620
01:17:29,270 --> 01:17:29,280
uh uh was uh how to approach
 

4621
01:17:29,280 --> 01:17:31,910
uh uh was uh how to approach
you know how much of biological

4622
01:17:31,910 --> 01:17:31,920
you know how much of biological
 

4623
01:17:31,920 --> 01:17:33,669
you know how much of biological
possibility and realism

4624
01:17:33,669 --> 01:17:33,679
possibility and realism
 

4625
01:17:33,679 --> 01:17:36,229
possibility and realism
do you want in the learning algorithms

4626
01:17:36,229 --> 01:17:36,239
do you want in the learning algorithms
 

4627
01:17:36,239 --> 01:17:36,950
do you want in the learning algorithms
um

4628
01:17:36,950 --> 01:17:36,960
um
 

4629
01:17:36,960 --> 01:17:40,310
um
so uh when i was there uh this was you

4630
01:17:40,310 --> 01:17:40,320
so uh when i was there uh this was you
 

4631
01:17:40,320 --> 01:17:40,950
so uh when i was there uh this was you
know

4632
01:17:40,950 --> 01:17:40,960
know
 

4633
01:17:40,960 --> 01:17:43,350
know
almost 10 years ago now so yeah you're

4634
01:17:43,350 --> 01:17:43,360
almost 10 years ago now so yeah you're
 

4635
01:17:43,360 --> 01:17:44,390
almost 10 years ago now so yeah you're
having fun

4636
01:17:44,390 --> 01:17:44,400
having fun
 

4637
01:17:44,400 --> 01:17:45,910
having fun
i don't know i don't know what just

4638
01:17:45,910 --> 01:17:45,920
i don't know i don't know what just
 

4639
01:17:45,920 --> 01:17:47,990
i don't know i don't know what just
thinks now but 10 years ago

4640
01:17:47,990 --> 01:17:48,000
thinks now but 10 years ago
 

4641
01:17:48,000 --> 01:17:50,470
thinks now but 10 years ago
uh the difference was that i did not

4642
01:17:50,470 --> 01:17:50,480
uh the difference was that i did not
 

4643
01:17:50,480 --> 01:17:51,350
uh the difference was that i did not
want to

4644
01:17:51,350 --> 01:17:51,360
want to
 

4645
01:17:51,360 --> 01:17:54,709
want to
be so constrained on saying uh

4646
01:17:54,709 --> 01:17:54,719
be so constrained on saying uh
 

4647
01:17:54,719 --> 01:17:56,870
be so constrained on saying uh
my learning algorithms won't need to be

4648
01:17:56,870 --> 01:17:56,880
my learning algorithms won't need to be
 

4649
01:17:56,880 --> 01:17:59,110
my learning algorithms won't need to be
biologically possible

4650
01:17:59,110 --> 01:17:59,120
biologically possible
 

4651
01:17:59,120 --> 01:18:01,110
biologically possible
based on some filter of biological

4652
01:18:01,110 --> 01:18:01,120
based on some filter of biological
 

4653
01:18:01,120 --> 01:18:03,189
based on some filter of biological
possibility available at that time

4654
01:18:03,189 --> 01:18:03,199
possibility available at that time
 

4655
01:18:03,199 --> 01:18:05,830
possibility available at that time
to me that is a dangerous cut to make

4656
01:18:05,830 --> 01:18:05,840
to me that is a dangerous cut to make
 

4657
01:18:05,840 --> 01:18:06,709
to me that is a dangerous cut to make
because

4658
01:18:06,709 --> 01:18:06,719
because
 

4659
01:18:06,719 --> 01:18:08,630
because
we are you know discovering more and

4660
01:18:08,630 --> 01:18:08,640
we are you know discovering more and
 

4661
01:18:08,640 --> 01:18:10,470
we are you know discovering more and
more things about the brain all the time

4662
01:18:10,470 --> 01:18:10,480
more things about the brain all the time
 

4663
01:18:10,480 --> 01:18:13,189
more things about the brain all the time
new biophysical mechanisms new channels

4664
01:18:13,189 --> 01:18:13,199
new biophysical mechanisms new channels
 

4665
01:18:13,199 --> 01:18:13,669

uh

4666
01:18:13,669 --> 01:18:13,679
uh
 

4667
01:18:13,679 --> 01:18:15,590
uh
are being discovered all the time so i

4668
01:18:15,590 --> 01:18:15,600
are being discovered all the time so i
 

4669
01:18:15,600 --> 01:18:17,590
are being discovered all the time so i
don't want to upfront kill off

4670
01:18:17,590 --> 01:18:17,600
don't want to upfront kill off
 

4671
01:18:17,600 --> 01:18:20,790
don't want to upfront kill off
an uh a learning algorithm just because

4672
01:18:20,790 --> 01:18:20,800
an uh a learning algorithm just because
 

4673
01:18:20,800 --> 01:18:21,430
an uh a learning algorithm just because
we don't

4674
01:18:21,430 --> 01:18:21,440
we don't
 

4675
01:18:21,440 --> 01:18:24,229
we don't
really understand the full uh the full

let me ask a sergeant like what's our

4684
01:18:32,470 --> 01:18:32,480
let me ask a sergeant like what's our
 

4685
01:18:32,480 --> 01:18:34,229
let me ask a sergeant like what's our
what's your sense what's our best

4686
01:18:34,229 --> 01:18:34,239
what's your sense what's our best
 

4687
01:18:34,239 --> 01:18:35,669
what's your sense what's our best
understanding of how the brain

4688
01:18:35,669 --> 01:18:35,679
understanding of how the brain
 

4689
01:18:35,679 --> 01:18:39,750
understanding of how the brain
learns so things like back propagation

4690
01:18:39,750 --> 01:18:39,760
learns so things like back propagation
 

4691
01:18:39,760 --> 01:18:41,189
learns so things like back propagation
credit assignment so so

4692
01:18:41,189 --> 01:18:41,199
credit assignment so so
 

4693
01:18:41,199 --> 01:18:43,590
credit assignment so so
many of these algorithms have learning

4694
01:18:43,590 --> 01:18:43,600
many of these algorithms have learning
 

4695
01:18:43,600 --> 01:18:45,270
many of these algorithms have learning
algorithms have things in common

4696
01:18:45,270 --> 01:18:45,280
algorithms have things in common
 

4697
01:18:45,280 --> 01:18:47,510
algorithms have things in common
right it is a back propagation is one

4698
01:18:47,510 --> 01:18:47,520
right it is a back propagation is one
 

4699
01:18:47,520 --> 01:18:49,189
right it is a back propagation is one
way of credit assignment

4700
01:18:49,189 --> 01:18:49,199
way of credit assignment
 

4701
01:18:49,199 --> 01:18:50,870
way of credit assignment
there is another algorithm called

4702
01:18:50,870 --> 01:18:50,880
there is another algorithm called
 

4703
01:18:50,880 --> 01:18:52,550
there is another algorithm called
expectation maximization

4704
01:18:52,550 --> 01:18:52,560
expectation maximization
 

4705
01:18:52,560 --> 01:18:55,110
expectation maximization
which is you know another weight

4706
01:18:55,110 --> 01:18:55,120
which is you know another weight
 

4707
01:18:55,120 --> 01:18:56,790
which is you know another weight
adjustment algorithm but is it your

4708
01:18:56,790 --> 01:18:56,800
adjustment algorithm but is it your
 

4709
01:18:56,800 --> 01:18:58,950
adjustment algorithm but is it your
sense the brain does something like this

4710
01:18:58,950 --> 01:18:58,960
sense the brain does something like this
 

4711
01:18:58,960 --> 01:19:01,510
sense the brain does something like this
has to there is no way around it in the

4712
01:19:01,510 --> 01:19:01,520
has to there is no way around it in the
 

4713
01:19:01,520 --> 01:19:02,470
has to there is no way around it in the
sense of saying that

4714
01:19:02,470 --> 01:19:02,480
sense of saying that
 

4715
01:19:02,480 --> 01:19:05,430
sense of saying that
you do have to adjust the the

4716
01:19:05,430 --> 01:19:05,440
you do have to adjust the the
 

4717
01:19:05,440 --> 01:19:06,310
you do have to adjust the the
connections

4718
01:19:06,310 --> 01:19:06,320
connections
 

4719
01:19:06,320 --> 01:19:07,510
connections
so yeah and you're saying credit

4720
01:19:07,510 --> 01:19:07,520
so yeah and you're saying credit
 

4721
01:19:07,520 --> 01:19:08,790
so yeah and you're saying credit
assignment you have to reward the

4722
01:19:08,790 --> 01:19:08,800
assignment you have to reward the
 

4723
01:19:08,800 --> 01:19:10,470
assignment you have to reward the
connections that were useful and making

4724
01:19:10,470 --> 01:19:10,480
connections that were useful and making
 

4725
01:19:10,480 --> 01:19:12,470
connections that were useful and making
a correct prediction and not

4726
01:19:12,470 --> 01:19:12,480
a correct prediction and not
 

4727
01:19:12,480 --> 01:19:14,550
a correct prediction and not
yeah i guess what up but yeah it doesn't

4728
01:19:14,550 --> 01:19:14,560
yeah i guess what up but yeah it doesn't
 

4729
01:19:14,560 --> 01:19:16,070
yeah i guess what up but yeah it doesn't
have to be

4730
01:19:16,070 --> 01:19:16,080
have to be
 

4731
01:19:16,080 --> 01:19:17,990
have to be
differentiable i mean yeah it doesn't

4732
01:19:17,990 --> 01:19:18,000
differentiable i mean yeah it doesn't
 

4733
01:19:18,000 --> 01:19:19,510
differentiable i mean yeah it doesn't
have to be differentiable yeah yeah

4734
01:19:19,510 --> 01:19:19,520
have to be differentiable yeah yeah
 

4735
01:19:19,520 --> 01:19:22,550
have to be differentiable yeah yeah
but you have to have a you know you have

4736
01:19:22,550 --> 01:19:22,560
but you have to have a you know you have
 

4737
01:19:22,560 --> 01:19:22,870
but you have to have a you know you have
a

4738
01:19:22,870 --> 01:19:22,880
a
 

4739
01:19:22,880 --> 01:19:24,790
a
model that you start with you where you

4740
01:19:24,790 --> 01:19:24,800
model that you start with you where you
 

4741
01:19:24,800 --> 01:19:25,910
model that you start with you where you
have data comes in

4742
01:19:25,910 --> 01:19:25,920
have data comes in
 

4743
01:19:25,920 --> 01:19:29,270
have data comes in
and you have to have a way of adjusting

4744
01:19:29,270 --> 01:19:29,280
and you have to have a way of adjusting
 

4745
01:19:29,280 --> 01:19:31,189
and you have to have a way of adjusting
the model such that it better fits the

4746
01:19:31,189 --> 01:19:31,199
the model such that it better fits the
 

4747
01:19:31,199 --> 01:19:33,350
the model such that it better fits the
data yeah so that that is all of

4748
01:19:33,350 --> 01:19:33,360
data yeah so that that is all of
 

4749
01:19:33,360 --> 01:19:34,550
data yeah so that that is all of
learning right

4750
01:19:34,550 --> 01:19:34,560
learning right
 

4751
01:19:34,560 --> 01:19:37,030
learning right
and some of them can be using backprop

4752
01:19:37,030 --> 01:19:37,040
and some of them can be using backprop
 

4753
01:19:37,040 --> 01:19:37,910
and some of them can be using backprop
to do that

4754
01:19:37,910 --> 01:19:37,920
to do that
 

4755
01:19:37,920 --> 01:19:40,709
to do that
some of it can be using uh you know very

4756
01:19:40,709 --> 01:19:40,719
some of it can be using uh you know very
 

4757
01:19:40,719 --> 01:19:41,430
some of it can be using uh you know very
local

4758
01:19:41,430 --> 01:19:41,440
local
 

4759
01:19:41,440 --> 01:19:44,709
local
uh graph changes to do that

4760
01:19:44,709 --> 01:19:44,719
uh graph changes to do that
 

4761
01:19:44,719 --> 01:19:47,830
uh graph changes to do that
um that can you know many of these

4762
01:19:47,830 --> 01:19:47,840
um that can you know many of these
 

4763
01:19:47,840 --> 01:19:48,830
um that can you know many of these
learning algorithms

4764
01:19:48,830 --> 01:19:48,840
learning algorithms
 

4765
01:19:48,840 --> 01:19:53,990
learning algorithms
have similar update properties locally

4766
01:19:53,990 --> 01:19:54,000
have similar update properties locally
 

4767
01:19:54,000 --> 01:19:56,229
have similar update properties locally
in terms of what the neurons need to do

4768
01:19:56,229 --> 01:19:56,239
in terms of what the neurons need to do
 

4769
01:19:56,239 --> 01:19:57,270
in terms of what the neurons need to do
locally

4770
01:19:57,270 --> 01:19:57,280
locally
 

4771
01:19:57,280 --> 01:19:58,950
locally
i wonder if small differences in

4772
01:19:58,950 --> 01:19:58,960
i wonder if small differences in
 

4773
01:19:58,960 --> 01:20:00,470
i wonder if small differences in
learning algorithms can have huge

4774
01:20:00,470 --> 01:20:00,480
learning algorithms can have huge
 

4775
01:20:00,480 --> 01:20:02,229
learning algorithms can have huge
differences in the actual effect

4776
01:20:02,229 --> 01:20:02,239
differences in the actual effect
 

4777
01:20:02,239 --> 01:20:05,750
differences in the actual effect
so the dynamics of i mean uh

4778
01:20:05,750 --> 01:20:05,760
so the dynamics of i mean uh
 

4779
01:20:05,760 --> 01:20:08,470
so the dynamics of i mean uh
sort of the reverse like spiking like

4780
01:20:08,470 --> 01:20:08,480
sort of the reverse like spiking like
 

4781
01:20:08,480 --> 01:20:09,590
sort of the reverse like spiking like
the uh

4782
01:20:09,590 --> 01:20:09,600
the uh
 

4783
01:20:09,600 --> 01:20:12,470
the uh
if if credit assignment is like a a

4784
01:20:12,470 --> 01:20:12,480
if if credit assignment is like a a
 

4785
01:20:12,480 --> 01:20:13,910
if if credit assignment is like a a
lightning versus like

4786
01:20:13,910 --> 01:20:13,920
lightning versus like
 

4787
01:20:13,920 --> 01:20:18,229
lightning versus like
a rainstorm or something like whether

4788
01:20:18,229 --> 01:20:18,239
a rainstorm or something like whether
 

4789
01:20:18,239 --> 01:20:21,510
a rainstorm or something like whether
whether there's a like a looping

4790
01:20:21,510 --> 01:20:21,520
whether there's a like a looping
 

4791
01:20:21,520 --> 01:20:23,830
whether there's a like a looping
local type of situation with the credit

4792
01:20:23,830 --> 01:20:23,840
local type of situation with the credit
 

4793
01:20:23,840 --> 01:20:24,790
local type of situation with the credit

4794
01:20:24,790 --> 01:20:24,800
assignment
 

4795
01:20:24,800 --> 01:20:27,990
assignment
yeah whether there is uh

4796
01:20:27,990 --> 01:20:28,000
yeah whether there is uh
 

4797
01:20:28,000 --> 01:20:31,669
yeah whether there is uh
like regularization like how

4798
01:20:31,669 --> 01:20:31,679
like regularization like how
 

4799
01:20:31,679 --> 01:20:33,990
like regularization like how
um how it injects robustness into the

4800
01:20:33,990 --> 01:20:34,000
um how it injects robustness into the
 

4801
01:20:34,000 --> 01:20:35,590
um how it injects robustness into the
whole thing

4802
01:20:35,590 --> 01:20:35,600
whole thing
 

4803
01:20:35,600 --> 01:20:38,629
whole thing
like whether it's chemical or electrical

4804
01:20:38,629 --> 01:20:38,639
like whether it's chemical or electrical
 

4805
01:20:38,639 --> 01:20:42,070
like whether it's chemical or electrical
or mechanical yeah uh all those kinds of

4806
01:20:42,070 --> 01:20:42,080
or mechanical yeah uh all those kinds of
 

4807
01:20:42,080 --> 01:20:43,110
or mechanical yeah uh all those kinds of
things like that

4808
01:20:43,110 --> 01:20:43,120
things like that
 

4809
01:20:43,120 --> 01:20:46,950
things like that
i feel like it that yeah

4810
01:20:46,950 --> 01:20:46,960
i feel like it that yeah
 

4811
01:20:46,960 --> 01:20:48,550
i feel like it that yeah
i feel like those differences could be

4812
01:20:48,550 --> 01:20:48,560
i feel like those differences could be
 

4813
01:20:48,560 --> 01:20:50,149
i feel like those differences could be
essential right it could be

4814
01:20:50,149 --> 01:20:50,159
essential right it could be
 

4815
01:20:50,159 --> 01:20:53,830
essential right it could be
it's just that you don't know enough to

4816
01:20:53,830 --> 01:20:53,840
it's just that you don't know enough to
 

4817
01:20:53,840 --> 01:20:57,270
it's just that you don't know enough to
on the learning side you don't know

4818
01:20:57,270 --> 01:20:57,280
on the learning side you don't know
 

4819
01:20:57,280 --> 01:20:59,590
on the learning side you don't know
enough to say that is definitely not the

4820
01:20:59,590 --> 01:20:59,600
enough to say that is definitely not the
 

4821
01:20:59,600 --> 01:21:01,110
enough to say that is definitely not the
way the brain does it

4822
01:21:01,110 --> 01:21:01,120
way the brain does it
 

4823
01:21:01,120 --> 01:21:02,790
way the brain does it
got it so you don't want to be stuck to

4824
01:21:02,790 --> 01:21:02,800
got it so you don't want to be stuck to
 

4825
01:21:02,800 --> 01:21:04,149
got it so you don't want to be stuck to
it right so that yeah

4826
01:21:04,149 --> 01:21:04,159
it right so that yeah
 

4827
01:21:04,159 --> 01:21:06,229
it right so that yeah
so you you've been open-minded on that

4828
01:21:06,229 --> 01:21:06,239
so you you've been open-minded on that
 

4829
01:21:06,239 --> 01:21:07,669
so you you've been open-minded on that
side of that correct on the

4830
01:21:07,669 --> 01:21:07,679
side of that correct on the
 

4831
01:21:07,679 --> 01:21:09,270
side of that correct on the
infrastructure on the recognition side i

4832
01:21:09,270 --> 01:21:09,280
infrastructure on the recognition side i
 

4833
01:21:09,280 --> 01:21:09,750
infrastructure on the recognition side i
am

4834
01:21:09,750 --> 01:21:09,760
am
 

4835
01:21:09,760 --> 01:21:12,390
am
much more uh i'm able to be constrained

4836
01:21:12,390 --> 01:21:12,400
much more uh i'm able to be constrained
 

4837
01:21:12,400 --> 01:21:13,270
much more uh i'm able to be constrained
because

4838
01:21:13,270 --> 01:21:13,280
because
 

4839
01:21:13,280 --> 01:21:14,790
because
it's much easier to do experiments

4840
01:21:14,790 --> 01:21:14,800
it's much easier to do experiments
 

4841
01:21:14,800 --> 01:21:16,070
it's much easier to do experiments
because you know it's like okay here's

4842
01:21:16,070 --> 01:21:16,080
because you know it's like okay here's
 

4843
01:21:16,080 --> 01:21:17,030
because you know it's like okay here's
the stimulus

4844
01:21:17,030 --> 01:21:17,040
the stimulus
 

4845
01:21:17,040 --> 01:21:18,709
the stimulus
you know how many steps did it get to

4846
01:21:18,709 --> 01:21:18,719
you know how many steps did it get to
 

4847
01:21:18,719 --> 01:21:21,189
you know how many steps did it get to
take the answer i can trace it back

4848
01:21:21,189 --> 01:21:21,199
take the answer i can trace it back
 

4849
01:21:21,199 --> 01:21:23,430
take the answer i can trace it back
i can i can understand the speed of that

4850
01:21:23,430 --> 01:21:23,440
i can i can understand the speed of that
 

4851
01:21:23,440 --> 01:21:24,390
i can i can understand the speed of that
computation

4852
01:21:24,390 --> 01:21:24,400
computation
 

4853
01:21:24,400 --> 01:21:27,830
computation
etc much more readily on the infant side

4854
01:21:27,830 --> 01:21:27,840
etc much more readily on the infant side
 

4855
01:21:27,840 --> 01:21:28,709
etc much more readily on the infant side
got it and then

4856
01:21:28,709 --> 01:21:28,719
got it and then
 

4857
01:21:28,719 --> 01:21:30,149
got it and then
you can't do good experiments on the

4858
01:21:30,149 --> 01:21:30,159
you can't do good experiments on the
 

4859
01:21:30,159 --> 01:21:32,790
you can't do good experiments on the
learning side correct

4860
01:21:32,790 --> 01:21:32,800
learning side correct
 

4861
01:21:32,800 --> 01:21:35,430
learning side correct
so that let's let's go right into the

4862
01:21:35,430 --> 01:21:35,440
so that let's let's go right into the
 

4863
01:21:35,440 --> 01:21:37,430
so that let's let's go right into the
cortical micro circuits right back

4864
01:21:37,430 --> 01:21:37,440
cortical micro circuits right back
 

4865
01:21:37,440 --> 01:21:40,550
cortical micro circuits right back
so what uh what are these ideas

4866
01:21:40,550 --> 01:21:40,560
so what uh what are these ideas
 

4867
01:21:40,560 --> 01:21:43,270
so what uh what are these ideas
beyond recursive cortical network that

4868
01:21:43,270 --> 01:21:43,280
beyond recursive cortical network that
 

4869
01:21:43,280 --> 01:21:43,669
beyond recursive cortical network that
uh

4870
01:21:43,669 --> 01:21:43,679
uh
 

4871
01:21:43,679 --> 01:21:46,950
uh
you're looking at now so we have made a

4872
01:21:46,950 --> 01:21:46,960
you're looking at now so we have made a
 

4873
01:21:46,960 --> 01:21:48,629
you're looking at now so we have made a
you know pass through or you know

4874
01:21:48,629 --> 01:21:48,639
you know pass through or you know
 

4875
01:21:48,639 --> 01:21:50,149
you know pass through or you know
multiple of the steps that we

4876
01:21:50,149 --> 01:21:50,159
multiple of the steps that we
 

4877
01:21:50,159 --> 01:21:52,390
multiple of the steps that we
you know i say as i mentioned earlier

4878
01:21:52,390 --> 01:21:52,400
you know i say as i mentioned earlier
 

4879
01:21:52,400 --> 01:21:54,550
you know i say as i mentioned earlier
you know we were looking at perception

4880
01:21:54,550 --> 01:21:54,560
you know we were looking at perception
 

4881
01:21:54,560 --> 01:21:56,470
you know we were looking at perception
from the angle of cognition right it was

4882
01:21:56,470 --> 01:21:56,480
from the angle of cognition right it was
 

4883
01:21:56,480 --> 01:21:58,229
from the angle of cognition right it was
not just perception for perception's

4884
01:21:58,229 --> 01:21:58,239
not just perception for perception's
 

4885
01:21:58,239 --> 01:21:58,790
not just perception for perception's
sake

4886
01:21:58,790 --> 01:21:58,800
sake
 

4887
01:21:58,800 --> 01:22:00,390
sake
how do you how do you connect it to

4888
01:22:00,390 --> 01:22:00,400
how do you how do you connect it to
 

4889
01:22:00,400 --> 01:22:02,229
how do you how do you connect it to
cognition uh how do you learn

4890
01:22:02,229 --> 01:22:02,239
cognition uh how do you learn
 

4891
01:22:02,239 --> 01:22:04,790
cognition uh how do you learn
concepts and how do you learn abstract

4892
01:22:04,790 --> 01:22:04,800
concepts and how do you learn abstract
 

4893
01:22:04,800 --> 01:22:05,990
concepts and how do you learn abstract
reasoning uh

4894
01:22:05,990 --> 01:22:06,000
reasoning uh
 

4895
01:22:06,000 --> 01:22:08,149
reasoning uh
similar to some of the things francois

4896
01:22:08,149 --> 01:22:08,159
similar to some of the things francois
 

4897
01:22:08,159 --> 01:22:09,990
similar to some of the things francois
uh uh talked about right um

4898
01:22:09,990 --> 01:22:10,000
uh uh talked about right um
 

4899
01:22:10,000 --> 01:22:13,030
uh uh talked about right um
so um so

4900
01:22:13,030 --> 01:22:13,040
so um so
 

4901
01:22:13,040 --> 01:22:15,430
so um so
we have uh taken one pass through it

4902
01:22:15,430 --> 01:22:15,440
we have uh taken one pass through it
 

4903
01:22:15,440 --> 01:22:16,310
we have uh taken one pass through it
basically saying

4904
01:22:16,310 --> 01:22:16,320
basically saying
 

4905
01:22:16,320 --> 01:22:19,430
basically saying
what is the basic cognitive architecture

4906
01:22:19,430 --> 01:22:19,440
what is the basic cognitive architecture
 

4907
01:22:19,440 --> 01:22:21,669
what is the basic cognitive architecture
that you need to have which has a

4908
01:22:21,669 --> 01:22:21,679
that you need to have which has a
 

4909
01:22:21,679 --> 01:22:22,950
that you need to have which has a
perceptual system

4910
01:22:22,950 --> 01:22:22,960
perceptual system
 

4911
01:22:22,960 --> 01:22:25,110
perceptual system
which has a system that learns dynamics

4912
01:22:25,110 --> 01:22:25,120
which has a system that learns dynamics
 

4913
01:22:25,120 --> 01:22:26,629
which has a system that learns dynamics
of the world and

4914
01:22:26,629 --> 01:22:26,639
of the world and
 

4915
01:22:26,639 --> 01:22:29,830
of the world and
then has something like a routine

4916
01:22:29,830 --> 01:22:29,840
then has something like a routine
 

4917
01:22:29,840 --> 01:22:31,990
then has something like a routine
program learning system on top of it to

4918
01:22:31,990 --> 01:22:32,000
program learning system on top of it to
 

4919
01:22:32,000 --> 01:22:33,110
program learning system on top of it to
learn concepts

4920
01:22:33,110 --> 01:22:33,120
learn concepts
 

4921
01:22:33,120 --> 01:22:35,750
learn concepts
so we have we've built one the you know

4922
01:22:35,750 --> 01:22:35,760
so we have we've built one the you know
 

4923
01:22:35,760 --> 01:22:36,629
so we have we've built one the you know
the version

4924
01:22:36,629 --> 01:22:36,639
the version
 

4925
01:22:36,639 --> 01:22:39,590
the version
0.1 of that system uh this was another

4926
01:22:39,590 --> 01:22:39,600
0.1 of that system uh this was another
 

4927
01:22:39,600 --> 01:22:39,910
0.1 of that system uh this was another
uh

4928
01:22:39,910 --> 01:22:39,920
uh
 

4929
01:22:39,920 --> 01:22:42,470
uh
science robotics paper uh it is it's the

4930
01:22:42,470 --> 01:22:42,480
science robotics paper uh it is it's the
 

4931
01:22:42,480 --> 01:22:43,990
science robotics paper uh it is it's the
title of that paper was

4932
01:22:43,990 --> 01:22:44,000
title of that paper was
 

4933
01:22:44,000 --> 01:22:45,270
title of that paper was
you know something like cognitive

4934
01:22:45,270 --> 01:22:45,280
you know something like cognitive
 

4935
01:22:45,280 --> 01:22:46,870
you know something like cognitive
programs how do you build cognitive

4936
01:22:46,870 --> 01:22:46,880
programs how do you build cognitive
 

4937
01:22:46,880 --> 01:22:48,070
programs how do you build cognitive
programs

4938
01:22:48,070 --> 01:22:48,080
programs
 

4939
01:22:48,080 --> 01:22:51,350
programs
and and the application there was on

4940
01:22:51,350 --> 01:22:51,360
and and the application there was on
 

4941
01:22:51,360 --> 01:22:54,870
and and the application there was on
manipulation robotics it was um

4942
01:22:54,870 --> 01:22:54,880
manipulation robotics it was um
 

4943
01:22:54,880 --> 01:22:57,990
manipulation robotics it was um
so think of it like this suppose you uh

4944
01:22:57,990 --> 01:22:58,000
so think of it like this suppose you uh
 

4945
01:22:58,000 --> 01:22:58,629
so think of it like this suppose you uh
wanted to

4946
01:22:58,629 --> 01:22:58,639
wanted to
 

4947
01:22:58,639 --> 01:23:01,990
wanted to
tell a new person uh that you met

4948
01:23:01,990 --> 01:23:02,000
tell a new person uh that you met
 

4949
01:23:02,000 --> 01:23:03,990
tell a new person uh that you met
you don't know the language or that

4950
01:23:03,990 --> 01:23:04,000
you don't know the language or that
 

4951
01:23:04,000 --> 01:23:05,669
you don't know the language or that
person uses you want to communicate to

4952
01:23:05,669 --> 01:23:05,679
person uses you want to communicate to
 

4953
01:23:05,679 --> 01:23:06,709
person uses you want to communicate to
that person

4954
01:23:06,709 --> 01:23:06,719
that person
 

4955
01:23:06,719 --> 01:23:09,430
that person
uh to achieve some task right so i want

4956
01:23:09,430 --> 01:23:09,440
uh to achieve some task right so i want
 

4957
01:23:09,440 --> 01:23:10,149
uh to achieve some task right so i want
to say

4958
01:23:10,149 --> 01:23:10,159
to say
 

4959
01:23:10,159 --> 01:23:13,590
to say
hey um you need to pick up all the the

4960
01:23:13,590 --> 01:23:13,600
hey um you need to pick up all the the
 

4961
01:23:13,600 --> 01:23:15,669
hey um you need to pick up all the the
red cups from the kitchen counter and

4962
01:23:15,669 --> 01:23:15,679
red cups from the kitchen counter and
 

4963
01:23:15,679 --> 01:23:16,629
red cups from the kitchen counter and
put it here

4964
01:23:16,629 --> 01:23:16,639
put it here
 

4965
01:23:16,639 --> 01:23:19,189
put it here
right how do you communicate that right

4966
01:23:19,189 --> 01:23:19,199
right how do you communicate that right
 

4967
01:23:19,199 --> 01:23:19,990
right how do you communicate that right
you can show

4968
01:23:19,990 --> 01:23:20,000
you can show
 

4969
01:23:20,000 --> 01:23:22,149
you can show
pictures you can basically say look this

4970
01:23:22,149 --> 01:23:22,159
pictures you can basically say look this
 

4971
01:23:22,159 --> 01:23:23,830
pictures you can basically say look this
is the starting state

4972
01:23:23,830 --> 01:23:23,840
is the starting state
 

4973
01:23:23,840 --> 01:23:26,070
is the starting state
the the things are here this is the

4974
01:23:26,070 --> 01:23:26,080
the the things are here this is the
 

4975
01:23:26,080 --> 01:23:27,030
the the things are here this is the
ending state

4976
01:23:27,030 --> 01:23:27,040
ending state
 

4977
01:23:27,040 --> 01:23:29,030
ending state
and and what does the person need to

4978
01:23:29,030 --> 01:23:29,040
and and what does the person need to
 

4979
01:23:29,040 --> 01:23:30,070
and and what does the person need to
understand from that

4980
01:23:30,070 --> 01:23:30,080
understand from that
 

4981
01:23:30,080 --> 01:23:31,750
understand from that
the person need to understand what

4982
01:23:31,750 --> 01:23:31,760
the person need to understand what
 

4983
01:23:31,760 --> 01:23:33,590
the person need to understand what
conceptually happened in those pictures

4984
01:23:33,590 --> 01:23:33,600
conceptually happened in those pictures
 

4985
01:23:33,600 --> 01:23:34,070
conceptually happened in those pictures
from the

4986
01:23:34,070 --> 01:23:34,080
from the
 

4987
01:23:34,080 --> 01:23:37,669
from the
input to the output right so um

4988
01:23:37,669 --> 01:23:37,679
input to the output right so um
 

4989
01:23:37,679 --> 01:23:40,390
input to the output right so um
so we are looking at pre-verbal

4990
01:23:40,390 --> 01:23:40,400
so we are looking at pre-verbal
 

4991
01:23:40,400 --> 01:23:41,669
so we are looking at pre-verbal
conceptual understanding without

4992
01:23:41,669 --> 01:23:41,679
conceptual understanding without
 

4993
01:23:41,679 --> 01:23:42,470
conceptual understanding without
language

4994
01:23:42,470 --> 01:23:42,480
language
 

4995
01:23:42,480 --> 01:23:44,550
language
how do you how do you have a set of

4996
01:23:44,550 --> 01:23:44,560
how do you how do you have a set of
 

4997
01:23:44,560 --> 01:23:46,070
how do you how do you have a set of
concepts that you can

4998
01:23:46,070 --> 01:23:46,080
concepts that you can
 

4999
01:23:46,080 --> 01:23:49,270
concepts that you can
manipulate in your head uh and from

5000
01:23:49,270 --> 01:23:49,280
manipulate in your head uh and from
 

5001
01:23:49,280 --> 01:23:51,669
manipulate in your head uh and from
this in a set of images of input and

5002
01:23:51,669 --> 01:23:51,679
this in a set of images of input and
 

5003
01:23:51,679 --> 01:23:52,310
this in a set of images of input and
output

5004
01:23:52,310 --> 01:23:52,320
output
 

5005
01:23:52,320 --> 01:23:55,189
output
can you infer what is happening in those

5006
01:23:55,189 --> 01:23:55,199
can you infer what is happening in those
 

5007
01:23:55,199 --> 01:23:56,870
can you infer what is happening in those
images

5008
01:23:56,870 --> 01:23:56,880
images
 

5009
01:23:56,880 --> 01:23:58,149
images
got it with concepts that are

5010
01:23:58,149 --> 01:23:58,159
got it with concepts that are
 

5011
01:23:58,159 --> 01:24:00,550
got it with concepts that are
pre-language okay so what does it mean

5012
01:24:00,550 --> 01:24:00,560
pre-language okay so what does it mean
 

5013
01:24:00,560 --> 01:24:03,669
pre-language okay so what does it mean
for a concept to be pre-language like

5014
01:24:03,669 --> 01:24:03,679
for a concept to be pre-language like
 

5015
01:24:03,679 --> 01:24:06,790
for a concept to be pre-language like
yeah why why so why

5016
01:24:06,790 --> 01:24:06,800
yeah why why so why
 

5017
01:24:06,800 --> 01:24:10,070
yeah why why so why
why is language uh so important here

5018
01:24:10,070 --> 01:24:10,080
why is language uh so important here
 

5019
01:24:10,080 --> 01:24:12,149
why is language uh so important here
so i i want to make a distinction

5020
01:24:12,149 --> 01:24:12,159
so i i want to make a distinction
 

5021
01:24:12,159 --> 01:24:13,110
so i i want to make a distinction
between

5022
01:24:13,110 --> 01:24:13,120
between
 

5023
01:24:13,120 --> 01:24:17,590
between
concepts that are just learned from text

5024
01:24:17,590 --> 01:24:17,600
concepts that are just learned from text
 

5025
01:24:17,600 --> 01:24:20,629
concepts that are just learned from text
by just just feeding brute force text uh

5026
01:24:20,629 --> 01:24:20,639
by just just feeding brute force text uh
 

5027
01:24:20,639 --> 01:24:23,030
by just just feeding brute force text uh
you can you can start extracting things

5028
01:24:23,030 --> 01:24:23,040
you can you can start extracting things
 

5029
01:24:23,040 --> 01:24:23,990
you can you can start extracting things
like okay

5030
01:24:23,990 --> 01:24:24,000
like okay
 

5031
01:24:24,000 --> 01:24:28,629
like okay
uh cow is likely to be on grass

5032
01:24:28,629 --> 01:24:28,639
uh cow is likely to be on grass
 

5033
01:24:28,639 --> 01:24:30,470
uh cow is likely to be on grass
so those kinds of things you can extract

5034
01:24:30,470 --> 01:24:30,480
so those kinds of things you can extract
 

5035
01:24:30,480 --> 01:24:32,229
so those kinds of things you can extract
purely from text um

5036
01:24:32,229 --> 01:24:32,239
purely from text um
 

5037
01:24:32,239 --> 01:24:34,629
purely from text um
uh but that's kind of a simple

5038
01:24:34,629 --> 01:24:34,639
uh but that's kind of a simple
 

5039
01:24:34,639 --> 01:24:35,350
uh but that's kind of a simple
association

5040
01:24:35,350 --> 01:24:35,360
association
 

5041
01:24:35,360 --> 01:24:37,750
association
uh thing rather than a concept as an

5042
01:24:37,750 --> 01:24:37,760
uh thing rather than a concept as an
 

5043
01:24:37,760 --> 01:24:38,950
uh thing rather than a concept as an
abstraction of something

5044
01:24:38,950 --> 01:24:38,960
abstraction of something
 

5045
01:24:38,960 --> 01:24:41,270
abstraction of something
that happens in the real world you know

5046
01:24:41,270 --> 01:24:41,280
that happens in the real world you know
 

5047
01:24:41,280 --> 01:24:42,070
that happens in the real world you know
in a

in a
grounded way that i can i can simulate

01:24:44,870 --> 01:24:44,880
grounded way that i can i can simulate
 

5051
01:24:44,880 --> 01:24:46,790
grounded way that i can i can simulate
it in my mind and connect it

5052
01:24:46,790 --> 01:24:46,800
it in my mind and connect it
 

5053
01:24:46,800 --> 01:24:49,270
it in my mind and connect it
back to the real world and you think

5054
01:24:49,270 --> 01:24:49,280
back to the real world and you think
 

5055
01:24:49,280 --> 01:24:50,790
back to the real world and you think
kind of the visual

5056
01:24:50,790 --> 01:24:50,800
kind of the visual
 

5057
01:24:50,800 --> 01:24:52,870
kind of the visual

are somehow lower level than just the
 

5063
01:24:57,520 --> 01:25:00,229
are somehow lower level than just the

it
 

5067
01:25:00,560 --> 01:25:02,550
it
feel like okay that's like unimportant

uh i would say uh
 

5073
01:25:07,199 --> 01:25:11,910
uh i would say uh
the concepts in the visual and the motor

5074
01:25:11,910 --> 01:25:11,920
the concepts in the visual and the motor
 

5075

01:25:15,280 --> 01:25:16,149
and you know the uh the concept learning
system which

5080
01:25:16,149 --> 01:25:16,159
system which
 

5081
01:25:16,159 --> 01:25:18,229
system which
if you cut off the language part just uh

5082
01:25:18,229 --> 01:25:18,239
if you cut off the language part just uh
 

5083
01:25:18,239 --> 01:25:19,990
if you cut off the language part just uh
just what we learned by interacting with

5084
01:25:19,990 --> 01:25:20,000
just what we learned by interacting with
 

5085
01:25:20,000 --> 01:25:21,910
just what we learned by interacting with
the world and abstractions from that

5086
01:25:21,910 --> 01:25:21,920
the world and abstractions from that
 

5087
01:25:21,920 --> 01:25:24,709
the world and abstractions from that
that is a prerequisite for any real

5088
01:25:24,709 --> 01:25:24,719
that is a prerequisite for any real
 

5089
01:25:24,719 --> 01:25:26,550
that is a prerequisite for any real
language understanding

5090
01:25:26,550 --> 01:25:26,560
language understanding
 

5091
01:25:26,560 --> 01:25:28,470
language understanding
so you're uh so you disagree with

5092
01:25:28,470 --> 01:25:28,480
so you're uh so you disagree with
 

5093
01:25:28,480 --> 01:25:30,550
so you're uh so you disagree with
chomsky because he says language is at

5094
01:25:30,550 --> 01:25:30,560
chomsky because he says language is at
 

5095
01:25:30,560 --> 01:25:32,149
chomsky because he says language is at
the bottom of everything

5096
01:25:32,149 --> 01:25:32,159
the bottom of everything
 

5097
01:25:32,159 --> 01:25:34,470
the bottom of everything
no i i yeah i disagree with chomsky

5098
01:25:34,470 --> 01:25:34,480
no i i yeah i disagree with chomsky
 

5099
01:25:34,480 --> 01:25:36,310
no i i yeah i disagree with chomsky
completely

5100
01:25:36,310 --> 01:25:36,320
completely
 

5101
01:25:36,320 --> 01:25:39,750
completely
from from universal grammar to yeah

5102
01:25:39,750 --> 01:25:39,760
from from universal grammar to yeah
 

5103
01:25:39,760 --> 01:25:41,750
from from universal grammar to yeah
so that was a paper in science beyond

5104
01:25:41,750 --> 01:25:41,760
so that was a paper in science beyond
 

5105
01:25:41,760 --> 01:25:43,590
so that was a paper in science beyond
the recursive cortical network

5106
01:25:43,590 --> 01:25:43,600
the recursive cortical network
 

5107
01:25:43,600 --> 01:25:46,310
the recursive cortical network
uh what what other interesting problems

5108
01:25:46,310 --> 01:25:46,320
uh what what other interesting problems
 

5109
01:25:46,320 --> 01:25:47,110
uh what what other interesting problems
are there

5110
01:25:47,110 --> 01:25:47,120
are there
 

5111
01:25:47,120 --> 01:25:50,390
are there
the open problems and brain inspired uh

5112
01:25:50,390 --> 01:25:50,400
the open problems and brain inspired uh
 

5113
01:25:50,400 --> 01:25:52,470
the open problems and brain inspired uh
approaches that you're thinking about i

5114
01:25:52,470 --> 01:25:52,480
approaches that you're thinking about i
 

5115
01:25:52,480 --> 01:25:53,910
approaches that you're thinking about i
mean everything is over right like you

5116
01:25:53,910 --> 01:25:53,920
mean everything is over right like you
 

5117
01:25:53,920 --> 01:25:54,390
mean everything is over right like you
know no

5118
01:25:54,390 --> 01:25:54,400
know no
 

5119
01:25:54,400 --> 01:25:57,510
know no
no no problem is uh solved solved all

5120
01:25:57,510 --> 01:25:57,520
no no problem is uh solved solved all
 

5121
01:25:57,520 --> 01:25:58,310
no no problem is uh solved solved all
right uh

5122
01:25:58,310 --> 01:25:58,320
right uh
 

5123
01:25:58,320 --> 01:26:01,030
right uh
first uh i think of perception as kind

5124
01:26:01,030 --> 01:26:01,040
first uh i think of perception as kind
 

5125
01:26:01,040 --> 01:26:01,590
first uh i think of perception as kind
of

5126
01:26:01,590 --> 01:26:01,600
of
 

5127
01:26:01,600 --> 01:26:03,990
of
the the pro the first thing that you

5128
01:26:03,990 --> 01:26:04,000
the the pro the first thing that you
 

5129
01:26:04,000 --> 01:26:05,510
the the pro the first thing that you
have to build

5130
01:26:05,510 --> 01:26:05,520
have to build
 

5131
01:26:05,520 --> 01:26:07,510
have to build
but the last thing that you will be

5132
01:26:07,510 --> 01:26:07,520
but the last thing that you will be
 

5133
01:26:07,520 --> 01:26:09,750
but the last thing that you will be
actually solved

5134
01:26:09,750 --> 01:26:09,760
actually solved
 

5135
01:26:09,760 --> 01:26:12,470
actually solved
so because if you do not build

5136
01:26:12,470 --> 01:26:12,480
so because if you do not build
 

5137
01:26:12,480 --> 01:26:14,229
so because if you do not build
perception system in the right way

5138
01:26:14,229 --> 01:26:14,239
perception system in the right way
 

5139
01:26:14,239 --> 01:26:15,990
perception system in the right way
you cannot build concept system in the

5140
01:26:15,990 --> 01:26:16,000
you cannot build concept system in the
 

5141
01:26:16,000 --> 01:26:17,270
you cannot build concept system in the
right way

5142
01:26:17,270 --> 01:26:17,280
right way
 

5143
01:26:17,280 --> 01:26:19,030
right way
so so you have to build a perception

5144
01:26:19,030 --> 01:26:19,040
so so you have to build a perception
 

5145
01:26:19,040 --> 01:26:21,030
so so you have to build a perception
system however wrong that might be

5146
01:26:21,030 --> 01:26:21,040
system however wrong that might be
 

5147
01:26:21,040 --> 01:26:22,870
system however wrong that might be
you have to still build that and learn

5148
01:26:22,870 --> 01:26:22,880
you have to still build that and learn
 

5149
01:26:22,880 --> 01:26:24,229
you have to still build that and learn
concepts from there

5150
01:26:24,229 --> 01:26:24,239
concepts from there
 

5151
01:26:24,239 --> 01:26:26,870
concepts from there
and then you know keep it rating um and

5152
01:26:26,870 --> 01:26:26,880
and then you know keep it rating um and
 

5153
01:26:26,880 --> 01:26:28,470
and then you know keep it rating um and
and finally perception will get

5154
01:26:28,470 --> 01:26:28,480
and finally perception will get
 

5155
01:26:28,480 --> 01:26:31,030
and finally perception will get
solved fully when perception cognition

5156
01:26:31,030 --> 01:26:31,040
solved fully when perception cognition
 

5157
01:26:31,040 --> 01:26:32,870
solved fully when perception cognition
language all those things work together

5158
01:26:32,870 --> 01:26:32,880
language all those things work together
 

5159
01:26:32,880 --> 01:26:36,149
language all those things work together
finally so what uh i'm not

5160
01:26:36,149 --> 01:26:36,159
finally so what uh i'm not
 

5161
01:26:36,159 --> 01:26:37,910
finally so what uh i'm not
so great we've talked a lot about

5162
01:26:37,910 --> 01:26:37,920
so great we've talked a lot about
 

5163
01:26:37,920 --> 01:26:39,830
so great we've talked a lot about
perception but then maybe on the concept

5164
01:26:39,830 --> 01:26:39,840
perception but then maybe on the concept
 

5165
01:26:39,840 --> 01:26:40,629
perception but then maybe on the concept
side and like

5166
01:26:40,629 --> 01:26:40,639
side and like
 

5167
01:26:40,639 --> 01:26:43,830
side and like
common sense or just general reasoning

5168
01:26:43,830 --> 01:26:43,840
common sense or just general reasoning
 

5169
01:26:43,840 --> 01:26:44,550
common sense or just general reasoning
side

5170
01:26:44,550 --> 01:26:44,560
side
 

5171
01:26:44,560 --> 01:26:47,270
side
is there some some intuition you can

5172
01:26:47,270 --> 01:26:47,280
is there some some intuition you can
 

5173
01:26:47,280 --> 01:26:48,709
is there some some intuition you can
draw from the brain about

5174
01:26:48,709 --> 01:26:48,719
draw from the brain about
 

5175
01:26:48,719 --> 01:26:52,070
draw from the brain about
how we can do that so i have i have this

5176
01:26:52,070 --> 01:26:52,080
how we can do that so i have i have this
 

5177
01:26:52,080 --> 01:26:55,510
how we can do that so i have i have this
uh classic example i give um

5178
01:26:55,510 --> 01:26:55,520
uh classic example i give um
 

5179
01:26:55,520 --> 01:26:58,950
uh classic example i give um
so suppose i give you a few sentences

5180
01:26:58,950 --> 01:26:58,960
so suppose i give you a few sentences
 

5181
01:26:58,960 --> 01:27:00,629
so suppose i give you a few sentences
and then ask you a question following

5182
01:27:00,629 --> 01:27:00,639
and then ask you a question following
 

5183
01:27:00,639 --> 01:27:02,070
and then ask you a question following
that sentence this is a

5184
01:27:02,070 --> 01:27:02,080
that sentence this is a
 

5185
01:27:02,080 --> 01:27:03,910
that sentence this is a
natural language processing problem

5186
01:27:03,910 --> 01:27:03,920
natural language processing problem
 

5187
01:27:03,920 --> 01:27:05,270
natural language processing problem
right so so here

5188
01:27:05,270 --> 01:27:05,280
right so so here
 

5189
01:27:05,280 --> 01:27:08,709
right so so here
it goes i'm telling you uh sally pounded

5190
01:27:08,709 --> 01:27:08,719
it goes i'm telling you uh sally pounded
 

5191
01:27:08,719 --> 01:27:11,830
it goes i'm telling you uh sally pounded
a nail on the ceiling okay

5192
01:27:11,830 --> 01:27:11,840
a nail on the ceiling okay
 

5193
01:27:11,840 --> 01:27:14,149
a nail on the ceiling okay
oh that's a sentence now i am asking you

5194
01:27:14,149 --> 01:27:14,159
oh that's a sentence now i am asking you
 

5195
01:27:14,159 --> 01:27:15,750
oh that's a sentence now i am asking you
a question was the nail horizontal or

5196
01:27:15,750 --> 01:27:15,760
a question was the nail horizontal or
 

5197
01:27:15,760 --> 01:27:17,510
a question was the nail horizontal or
vertical

5198
01:27:17,510 --> 01:27:17,520
vertical
 

5199
01:27:17,520 --> 01:27:21,750
vertical
vertical okay how did you answer that

5200
01:27:21,750 --> 01:27:21,760
vertical okay how did you answer that
 

5201
01:27:21,760 --> 01:27:24,950
vertical okay how did you answer that
uh well i imagined sally it was kind of

5202
01:27:24,950 --> 01:27:24,960
uh well i imagined sally it was kind of
 

5203
01:27:24,960 --> 01:27:26,310
uh well i imagined sally it was kind of
hard to imagine what the hell she was

5204
01:27:26,310 --> 01:27:26,320
hard to imagine what the hell she was
 

5205
01:27:26,320 --> 01:27:26,870
hard to imagine what the hell she was
doing but

5206
01:27:26,870 --> 01:27:26,880
doing but
 

5207
01:27:26,880 --> 01:27:30,950
doing but
uh but i imagined i

5208
01:27:30,950 --> 01:27:30,960
uh but i imagined i
 

5209
01:27:30,960 --> 01:27:33,669
uh but i imagined i
had a visual of the whole situation

5210
01:27:33,669 --> 01:27:33,679
had a visual of the whole situation
 

5211
01:27:33,679 --> 01:27:34,229
had a visual of the whole situation
exactly

5212
01:27:34,229 --> 01:27:34,239
exactly
 

5213
01:27:34,239 --> 01:27:37,350
exactly
exactly so so here you know i i post a

5214
01:27:37,350 --> 01:27:37,360
exactly so so here you know i i post a
 

5215
01:27:37,360 --> 01:27:38,950
exactly so so here you know i i post a
question in natural language

5216
01:27:38,950 --> 01:27:38,960
question in natural language
 

5217
01:27:38,960 --> 01:27:42,229
question in natural language
the answer to that question was you you

5218
01:27:42,229 --> 01:27:42,239
the answer to that question was you you
 

5219
01:27:42,239 --> 01:27:44,149
the answer to that question was you you
got the answer from actually simulating

5220
01:27:44,149 --> 01:27:44,159
got the answer from actually simulating
 

5221
01:27:44,159 --> 01:27:46,070
got the answer from actually simulating
the scene now i can go more and more

5222
01:27:46,070 --> 01:27:46,080
the scene now i can go more and more
 

5223
01:27:46,080 --> 01:27:46,950
the scene now i can go more and more
detail about

5224
01:27:46,950 --> 01:27:46,960
detail about
 

5225
01:27:46,960 --> 01:27:48,709
detail about
okay was sally stan standing on

5226
01:27:48,709 --> 01:27:48,719
okay was sally stan standing on
 

5227
01:27:48,719 --> 01:27:50,229
okay was sally stan standing on
something while doing this you know

5228
01:27:50,229 --> 01:27:50,239
something while doing this you know
 

5229
01:27:50,239 --> 01:27:53,030
something while doing this you know
could could she have been uh standing on

5230
01:27:53,030 --> 01:27:53,040
could could she have been uh standing on
 

5231
01:27:53,040 --> 01:27:55,350
could could she have been uh standing on
a light bulb to do this you know i could

5232
01:27:55,350 --> 01:27:55,360
a light bulb to do this you know i could
 

5233
01:27:55,360 --> 01:27:57,030
a light bulb to do this you know i could
i could ask more and more questions

5234
01:27:57,030 --> 01:27:57,040
i could ask more and more questions
 

5235
01:27:57,040 --> 01:27:58,629
i could ask more and more questions
about this and i can ask

5236
01:27:58,629 --> 01:27:58,639
about this and i can ask
 

5237
01:27:58,639 --> 01:28:00,390
about this and i can ask
make you simulate the synonym scene in

5238
01:28:00,390 --> 01:28:00,400
make you simulate the synonym scene in
 

5239
01:28:00,400 --> 01:28:02,310
make you simulate the synonym scene in
more and more detail right

5240
01:28:02,310 --> 01:28:02,320
more and more detail right
 

5241
01:28:02,320 --> 01:28:04,629
more and more detail right
where is all that knowledge that you are

5242
01:28:04,629 --> 01:28:04,639
where is all that knowledge that you are
 

5243
01:28:04,639 --> 01:28:05,510
where is all that knowledge that you are
accessing

5244
01:28:05,510 --> 01:28:05,520
accessing
 

5245
01:28:05,520 --> 01:28:08,310

stored it is not in your language system

5246
01:28:08,310 --> 01:28:08,320
stored it is not in your language system
 

5247
01:28:08,320 --> 01:28:09,270
stored it is not in your language system
it is not

5248
01:28:09,270 --> 01:28:09,280
it is not
 

5249
01:28:09,280 --> 01:28:11,430
it is not
it was not just by reading text you got

5250
01:28:11,430 --> 01:28:11,440
it was not just by reading text you got
 

5251
01:28:11,440 --> 01:28:12,629
it was not just by reading text you got
that knowledge

5252
01:28:12,629 --> 01:28:12,639
that knowledge
 

5253
01:28:12,639 --> 01:28:14,709
that knowledge
it is stored from the everyday

5254
01:28:14,709 --> 01:28:14,719
it is stored from the everyday
 

5255
01:28:14,719 --> 01:28:16,550
it is stored from the everyday
experiences that you have had

5256
01:28:16,550 --> 01:28:16,560
experiences that you have had
 

5257
01:28:16,560 --> 01:28:19,030
experiences that you have had
from and and by the by the age of five

5258
01:28:19,030 --> 01:28:19,040

5259
01:28:19,040 --> 01:28:21,110
from and and by the by the age of five
you you have pretty much all of this

5260
01:28:21,110 --> 01:28:21,120
you you have pretty much all of this
 

5261
01:28:21,120 --> 01:28:23,910
you you have pretty much all of this
right and it is stored in your visual

5262
01:28:23,910 --> 01:28:23,920
right and it is stored in your visual
 

5263
01:28:23,920 --> 01:28:25,350
right and it is stored in your visual
system motor system

5264
01:28:25,350 --> 01:28:25,360
system motor system
 

5265
01:28:25,360 --> 01:28:27,910
system motor system
in a way such that it can be accessed

5266
01:28:27,910 --> 01:28:27,920
in a way such that it can be accessed
 

5267
01:28:27,920 --> 01:28:29,669
in a way such that it can be accessed
through language

5268
01:28:29,669 --> 01:28:29,679
through language
 

5269
01:28:29,679 --> 01:28:31,910
through language
i got it i mean right so your the

5270
01:28:31,910 --> 01:28:31,920
i got it i mean right so your the
 

5271
01:28:31,920 --> 01:28:33,189
i got it i mean right so your the
language is just

5272
01:28:33,189 --> 01:28:33,199
language is just
 

5273
01:28:33,199 --> 01:28:34,790
language is just
almost services the query into the whole

5274
01:28:34,790 --> 01:28:34,800
almost services the query into the whole
 

5275
01:28:34,800 --> 01:28:36,470
almost services the query into the whole
visual cortex and it does the whole

5276
01:28:36,470 --> 01:28:36,480
visual cortex and it does the whole
 

5277
01:28:36,480 --> 01:28:37,510
visual cortex and it does the whole
feedback thing

5278
01:28:37,510 --> 01:28:37,520
feedback thing
 

5279
01:28:37,520 --> 01:28:40,950
feedback thing
but i mean it is all reasoning kind of

5280
01:28:40,950 --> 01:28:40,960
but i mean it is all reasoning kind of
 

5281
01:28:40,960 --> 01:28:44,229
but i mean it is all reasoning kind of
connected to the perception system

5282
01:28:44,229 --> 01:28:44,239
connected to the perception system
 

5283
01:28:44,239 --> 01:28:46,310
connected to the perception system
in some way you can do a lot of it you

5284
01:28:46,310 --> 01:28:46,320
in some way you can do a lot of it you
 

5285
01:28:46,320 --> 01:28:47,430
in some way you can do a lot of it you
know you can still

5286
01:28:47,430 --> 01:28:47,440
know you can still
 

5287
01:28:47,440 --> 01:28:50,310
know you can still
um do a lot of it by quick associations

5288
01:28:50,310 --> 01:28:50,320
um do a lot of it by quick associations
 

5289
01:28:50,320 --> 01:28:51,510
um do a lot of it by quick associations
without having to

5290
01:28:51,510 --> 01:28:51,520
without having to
 

5291
01:28:51,520 --> 01:28:53,830
without having to
go into the depth and and most of the

5292
01:28:53,830 --> 01:28:53,840
go into the depth and and most of the
 

5293
01:28:53,840 --> 01:28:55,110
go into the depth and and most of the
time you will be right

5294
01:28:55,110 --> 01:28:55,120
time you will be right
 

5295
01:28:55,120 --> 01:28:57,430
time you will be right
right you can just do quick associations

5296
01:28:57,430 --> 01:28:57,440
right you can just do quick associations
 

5297
01:28:57,440 --> 01:28:59,430
right you can just do quick associations
but i can easily create tricky

5298
01:28:59,430 --> 01:28:59,440
but i can easily create tricky
 

5299
01:28:59,440 --> 01:29:00,790
but i can easily create tricky
situations for you where that quick

5300
01:29:00,790 --> 01:29:00,800
situations for you where that quick
 

5301
01:29:00,800 --> 01:29:02,229
situations for you where that quick
association is wrong

5302
01:29:02,229 --> 01:29:02,239
association is wrong
 

5303
01:29:02,239 --> 01:29:03,990
association is wrong
and you have to actually run the

5304
01:29:03,990 --> 01:29:04,000
and you have to actually run the
 

5305
01:29:04,000 --> 01:29:06,070
and you have to actually run the
simulation so the figuring out the

5306
01:29:06,070 --> 01:29:06,080
simulation so the figuring out the
 

5307
01:29:06,080 --> 01:29:09,590
simulation so the figuring out the
how these concepts connect

5308
01:29:09,590 --> 01:29:09,600
how these concepts connect
 

5309
01:29:09,600 --> 01:29:11,830
how these concepts connect
you have a good idea of how to do that

5310
01:29:11,830 --> 01:29:11,840
you have a good idea of how to do that
 

5311
01:29:11,840 --> 01:29:12,870
you have a good idea of how to do that
that's exactly what

5312
01:29:12,870 --> 01:29:12,880
that's exactly what
 

5313
01:29:12,880 --> 01:29:15,030
that's exactly what
that does one of the problems that we

5314
01:29:15,030 --> 01:29:15,040
that does one of the problems that we
 

5315
01:29:15,040 --> 01:29:16,310
that does one of the problems that we
are working on and and

5316
01:29:16,310 --> 01:29:16,320
are working on and and
 

5317
01:29:16,320 --> 01:29:18,149
are working on and and
and and the uh the way we are

5318
01:29:18,149 --> 01:29:18,159
and and the uh the way we are
 

5319
01:29:18,159 --> 01:29:19,669
and and the uh the way we are
approaching that is basically

5320
01:29:19,669 --> 01:29:19,679
approaching that is basically
 

5321
01:29:19,679 --> 01:29:23,189
approaching that is basically
saying okay you need to so the the uh

5322
01:29:23,189 --> 01:29:23,199
saying okay you need to so the the uh
 

5323
01:29:23,199 --> 01:29:25,910
saying okay you need to so the the uh
the takeaway is that language is

5324
01:29:25,910 --> 01:29:25,920
the takeaway is that language is
 

5325
01:29:25,920 --> 01:29:27,510
the takeaway is that language is
simulation control

5326
01:29:27,510 --> 01:29:27,520
simulation control
 

5327
01:29:27,520 --> 01:29:31,350
simulation control
and your perceptual plus uh motor system

5328
01:29:31,350 --> 01:29:31,360
and your perceptual plus uh motor system
 

5329
01:29:31,360 --> 01:29:35,110
and your perceptual plus uh motor system
is building a simulation of the world

5330
01:29:35,110 --> 01:29:35,120
is building a simulation of the world
 

5331
01:29:35,120 --> 01:29:37,110
is building a simulation of the world
and so so that's basically the way we

5332
01:29:37,110 --> 01:29:37,120
and so so that's basically the way we
 

5333
01:29:37,120 --> 01:29:38,229
and so so that's basically the way we
are approaching it and

5334
01:29:38,229 --> 01:29:38,239
are approaching it and
 

5335
01:29:38,239 --> 01:29:40,310
are approaching it and
the first thing that we built was a

5336
01:29:40,310 --> 01:29:40,320
the first thing that we built was a
 

5337
01:29:40,320 --> 01:29:42,149
the first thing that we built was a
controllable perceptual system

5338
01:29:42,149 --> 01:29:42,159
controllable perceptual system
 

5339
01:29:42,159 --> 01:29:44,149
controllable perceptual system
and we built a schema networks which was

5340
01:29:44,149 --> 01:29:44,159
and we built a schema networks which was
 

5341
01:29:44,159 --> 01:29:46,149
and we built a schema networks which was
a controllable dynamic system

5342
01:29:46,149 --> 01:29:46,159
a controllable dynamic system
 

5343
01:29:46,159 --> 01:29:48,550
a controllable dynamic system
then we built a concept learning system

5344
01:29:48,550 --> 01:29:48,560
then we built a concept learning system
 

5345
01:29:48,560 --> 01:29:49,189
then we built a concept learning system
that puts

5346
01:29:49,189 --> 01:29:49,199
that puts
 

5347
01:29:49,199 --> 01:29:52,070
that puts
all these things together into programs

5348
01:29:52,070 --> 01:29:52,080
all these things together into programs
 

5349
01:29:52,080 --> 01:29:53,590
all these things together into programs
are subtractions that you can

5350
01:29:53,590 --> 01:29:53,600
are subtractions that you can
 

5351
01:29:53,600 --> 01:29:56,709
are subtractions that you can
run and simulate and now we are taking

5352
01:29:56,709 --> 01:29:56,719
run and simulate and now we are taking
 

5353
01:29:56,719 --> 01:29:58,629
run and simulate and now we are taking
the step of connecting into language and

5354
01:29:58,629 --> 01:29:58,639
the step of connecting into language and
 

5355
01:29:58,639 --> 01:30:01,750
the step of connecting into language and
uh and uh it will be very simple

5356
01:30:01,750 --> 01:30:01,760
uh and uh it will be very simple
 

5357
01:30:01,760 --> 01:30:03,189
uh and uh it will be very simple
examples initially it will not be

5358
01:30:03,189 --> 01:30:03,199
examples initially it will not be
 

5359
01:30:03,199 --> 01:30:05,430
examples initially it will not be
the gpt three like examples but it will

5360
01:30:05,430 --> 01:30:05,440
the gpt three like examples but it will
 

5361
01:30:05,440 --> 01:30:08,550
the gpt three like examples but it will
be grounded simulation based language

5362
01:30:08,550 --> 01:30:08,560
be grounded simulation based language
 

5363
01:30:08,560 --> 01:30:12,070
be grounded simulation based language
and for like the the querying would be

5364
01:30:12,070 --> 01:30:12,080
and for like the the querying would be
 

5365
01:30:12,080 --> 01:30:13,350
and for like the the querying would be
like question answering

5366
01:30:13,350 --> 01:30:13,360
like question answering
 

5367
01:30:13,360 --> 01:30:15,030
like question answering
kind of thing correct correct and it

5368
01:30:15,030 --> 01:30:15,040
kind of thing correct correct and it
 

5369
01:30:15,040 --> 01:30:17,830
kind of thing correct correct and it
will be in some simple world initially

5370
01:30:17,830 --> 01:30:17,840
will be in some simple world initially
 

5371
01:30:17,840 --> 01:30:20,470
will be in some simple world initially
on you know uh i but it will be about

5372
01:30:20,470 --> 01:30:20,480
on you know uh i but it will be about
 

5373
01:30:20,480 --> 01:30:21,830
on you know uh i but it will be about
okay can the system

5374
01:30:21,830 --> 01:30:21,840
okay can the system
 

5375
01:30:21,840 --> 01:30:24,709
okay can the system
connect the language and uh ground it in

5376
01:30:24,709 --> 01:30:24,719
connect the language and uh ground it in
 

5377
01:30:24,719 --> 01:30:25,830
connect the language and uh ground it in
the right way and run the right

5378
01:30:25,830 --> 01:30:25,840
the right way and run the right
 

5379
01:30:25,840 --> 01:30:26,709
the right way and run the right
simulations

5380
01:30:26,709 --> 01:30:26,719

5381
01:30:26,719 --> 01:30:28,229

to come up with the answer and the goal

5382
01:30:28,229 --> 01:30:28,239
to come up with the answer and the goal
 

5383
01:30:28,239 --> 01:30:30,229
to come up with the answer and the goal
is to try to do things that for example

5384
01:30:30,229 --> 01:30:30,239
is to try to do things that for example
 

5385
01:30:30,239 --> 01:30:31,669
is to try to do things that for example
gpg3 couldn't do

5386
01:30:31,669 --> 01:30:31,679
gpg3 couldn't do
 

5387
01:30:31,679 --> 01:30:34,950
gpg3 couldn't do
got it speaking of which

5388
01:30:34,950 --> 01:30:34,960
got it speaking of which
 

5389
01:30:34,960 --> 01:30:38,470
got it speaking of which
if we could uh talk about gpt3

5390
01:30:38,470 --> 01:30:38,480
if we could uh talk about gpt3
 

5391
01:30:38,480 --> 01:30:41,590
if we could uh talk about gpt3
a little bit i think it's an interesting

5392
01:30:41,590 --> 01:30:41,600
a little bit i think it's an interesting
 

5393
01:30:41,600 --> 01:30:45,030
a little bit i think it's an interesting
thought-provoking set of ideas that open

5394
01:30:45,030 --> 01:30:45,040
thought-provoking set of ideas that open
 

5395
01:30:45,040 --> 01:30:46,629
thought-provoking set of ideas that open
ai is pushing forward i think it's good

5396
01:30:46,629 --> 01:30:46,639
ai is pushing forward i think it's good
 

5397
01:30:46,639 --> 01:30:48,229
ai is pushing forward i think it's good
for us to talk about

5398
01:30:48,229 --> 01:30:48,239
for us to talk about
 

5399
01:30:48,239 --> 01:30:50,149
for us to talk about
the limits and the possibilities in

5400
01:30:50,149 --> 01:30:50,159
the limits and the possibilities in
 

5401
01:30:50,159 --> 01:30:51,350
the limits and the possibilities in
neural networks so

5402
01:30:51,350 --> 01:30:51,360
neural networks so
 

5403
01:30:51,360 --> 01:30:53,030
neural networks so
in general what are your thoughts about

5404

01:31:50,629 --> 01:31:50,639
things like that so those things i think
 

5465
01:31:50,639 --> 01:31:52,390
things like that so those things i think
will happen less than gpt

5466

will happen less than gpt
 

5467
01:31:52,400 --> 01:31:54,470

have the fundamental limitations that it
 

5479

do you think within so it's taking a
 

5491

do you think
in that could could emerge something

in that could could emerge something
 

5499
01:32:24,480 --> 01:32:25,990
in that could could emerge something
that's an approximation

5500
01:32:25,990 --> 01:32:26,000
that's an approximation
 

5501
01:32:26,000 --> 01:32:28,629
that's an approximation
of a world model which essentially could

and it's a it's a it's a i'm not talking
about gpt three i'm talking about gpt

01:32:35,510 --> 01:32:35,520
about gpt three i'm talking about gpt
 

5509
01:32:35,520 --> 01:32:38,070
about gpt three i'm talking about gpt
four five and gpt 10. yeah i mean they

5510
01:32:38,070 --> 01:32:38,080
four five and gpt 10. yeah i mean they
 

5511
01:32:38,080 --> 01:32:38,870
four five and gpt 10. yeah i mean they
will look

5512
01:32:38,870 --> 01:32:38,880
will look
 

5513
01:32:38,880 --> 01:32:41,590
will look
more impressive than gpg3 so you can if

5514
01:32:41,590 --> 01:32:41,600
more impressive than gpg3 so you can if
 

5515
01:32:41,600 --> 01:32:43,590
more impressive than gpg3 so you can if
you take that to the extreme then

5516
01:32:43,590 --> 01:32:43,600
you take that to the extreme then
 

5517
01:32:43,600 --> 01:32:47,030
you take that to the extreme then
uh a markov chain of just first order

5518
01:32:47,030 --> 01:32:47,040
uh a markov chain of just first order
 

5519
01:32:47,040 --> 01:32:50,550
uh a markov chain of just first order
and if you if you go to um

5520
01:32:50,550 --> 01:32:50,560
and if you if you go to um
 

5521
01:32:50,560 --> 01:32:52,550
and if you if you go to um
i'm taking the other extreme if you read

5522
01:32:52,550 --> 01:32:52,560
i'm taking the other extreme if you read
 

5523
01:32:52,560 --> 01:32:54,149
i'm taking the other extreme if you read
shannon's book

5524
01:32:54,149 --> 01:32:54,159
shannon's book
 

5525
01:32:54,159 --> 01:32:57,910
shannon's book
right uh he has a model of english text

5526
01:32:57,910 --> 01:32:57,920
right uh he has a model of english text
 

5527
01:32:57,920 --> 01:33:00,390
right uh he has a model of english text
which is based on faster mark of chains

5528
01:33:00,390 --> 01:33:00,400
which is based on faster mark of chains
 

5529
01:33:00,400 --> 01:33:02,070
which is based on faster mark of chains
second order markov chains third markov

5530
01:33:02,070 --> 01:33:02,080
second order markov chains third markov
 

5531
01:33:02,080 --> 01:33:02,950
second order markov chains third markov
chain sentencing that

5532
01:33:02,950 --> 01:33:02,960
chain sentencing that
 

5533
01:33:02,960 --> 01:33:05,189
chain sentencing that
okay the markov chains look better than

5534
01:33:05,189 --> 01:33:05,199
okay the markov chains look better than
 

5535
01:33:05,199 --> 01:33:05,990
okay the markov chains look better than
uh

5536
01:33:05,990 --> 01:33:06,000
uh
 

5537
01:33:06,000 --> 01:33:08,950
uh
faster markov chains right so does that

5538
01:33:08,950 --> 01:33:08,960
faster markov chains right so does that
 

5539
01:33:08,960 --> 01:33:09,270
faster markov chains right so does that
mean

5540
01:33:09,270 --> 01:33:09,280
mean
 

5541
01:33:09,280 --> 01:33:12,229
mean
a faster markov chain has a model of the

5542
01:33:12,229 --> 01:33:12,239
a faster markov chain has a model of the
 

5543
01:33:12,239 --> 01:33:12,709
a faster markov chain has a model of the
world

5544
01:33:12,709 --> 01:33:12,719
world
 

5545
01:33:12,719 --> 01:33:16,310
world
yes it does uh so yes in that level

5546
01:33:16,310 --> 01:33:16,320
yes it does uh so yes in that level
 

5547
01:33:16,320 --> 01:33:19,910
yes it does uh so yes in that level
uh when you go higher order models or

5548
01:33:19,910 --> 01:33:19,920
uh when you go higher order models or
 

5549
01:33:19,920 --> 01:33:22,390
uh when you go higher order models or
more uh sophisticated structure in the

5550
01:33:22,390 --> 01:33:22,400
more uh sophisticated structure in the
 

5551
01:33:22,400 --> 01:33:24,149
more uh sophisticated structure in the
model like the transformer networks have

5552
01:33:24,149 --> 01:33:24,159
model like the transformer networks have
 

5553
01:33:24,159 --> 01:33:27,189
model like the transformer networks have
yes they have a model of the text world

5554
01:33:27,189 --> 01:33:27,199
yes they have a model of the text world
 

5555
01:33:27,199 --> 01:33:30,310
yes they have a model of the text world
um but that is not a model of

5556
01:33:30,310 --> 01:33:30,320
um but that is not a model of
 

5557
01:33:30,320 --> 01:33:32,870
um but that is not a model of
uh the world it's it's a model of the

5558
01:33:32,870 --> 01:33:32,880
uh the world it's it's a model of the
 

5559
01:33:32,880 --> 01:33:34,830
uh the world it's it's a model of the
text world and it will have in

5560
01:33:34,830 --> 01:33:34,840
text world and it will have in
 

5561
01:33:34,840 --> 01:33:38,070
text world and it will have in
interesting uh properties and it will be

5562
01:33:38,070 --> 01:33:38,080
interesting uh properties and it will be
 

5563
01:33:38,080 --> 01:33:39,030
interesting uh properties and it will be
useful

5564
01:33:39,030 --> 01:33:39,040
useful
 

5565
01:33:39,040 --> 01:33:42,870
useful
but just scaling it up is not going to

5566
01:33:42,870 --> 01:33:42,880
but just scaling it up is not going to
 

5567
01:33:42,880 --> 01:33:46,149
but just scaling it up is not going to
give us a gi or natural language

5568
01:33:46,149 --> 01:33:46,159
give us a gi or natural language
 

5569
01:33:46,159 --> 01:33:49,350
give us a gi or natural language
understanding or meaning well the the

5570
01:33:49,350 --> 01:33:49,360
understanding or meaning well the the
 

5571
01:33:49,360 --> 01:33:50,390
understanding or meaning well the the
question is

5572
01:33:50,390 --> 01:33:50,400
question is
 

5573
01:33:50,400 --> 01:33:54,310
question is
uh whether being forced to compress a

5574
01:33:54,310 --> 01:33:54,320
uh whether being forced to compress a
 

5575
01:33:54,320 --> 01:33:56,229
uh whether being forced to compress a
very large amount of text

5576
01:33:56,229 --> 01:33:56,239
very large amount of text
 

5577
01:33:56,239 --> 01:33:59,510
very large amount of text
yeah forces you to construct things that

5578
01:33:59,510 --> 01:33:59,520
yeah forces you to construct things that
 

5579
01:33:59,520 --> 01:34:00,310
yeah forces you to construct things that
are

5580
01:34:00,310 --> 01:34:00,320
are
 

5581
01:34:00,320 --> 01:34:03,910
are
very much like because the ideas of

5582
01:34:03,910 --> 01:34:03,920
very much like because the ideas of
 

5583
01:34:03,920 --> 01:34:06,149
very much like because the ideas of
concepts and meaning is

5584
01:34:06,149 --> 01:34:06,159
concepts and meaning is
 

5585
01:34:06,159 --> 01:34:09,350
concepts and meaning is
a spectrum yeah uh

5586
01:34:09,350 --> 01:34:09,360
a spectrum yeah uh
 

5587
01:34:09,360 --> 01:34:11,750
a spectrum yeah uh
so in order to form that kind of

5588
01:34:11,750 --> 01:34:11,760
so in order to form that kind of
 

5589
01:34:11,760 --> 01:34:13,990
so in order to form that kind of
compression

5590
01:34:13,990 --> 01:34:14,000
compression
 

5591
01:34:14,000 --> 01:34:19,430
compression
maybe it will uh be forced to figure out

5592
01:34:19,430 --> 01:34:19,440
maybe it will uh be forced to figure out
 

5593
01:34:19,440 --> 01:34:22,550
maybe it will uh be forced to figure out
abstractions which look awfully a lot

5594
01:34:22,550 --> 01:34:22,560
abstractions which look awfully a lot
 

5595
01:34:22,560 --> 01:34:24,870
abstractions which look awfully a lot
like the kind of things that we think

5596
01:34:24,870 --> 01:34:24,880
like the kind of things that we think
 

5597
01:34:24,880 --> 01:34:26,390
like the kind of things that we think
about as uh

5598
01:34:26,390 --> 01:34:26,400
about as uh
 

5599
01:34:26,400 --> 01:34:28,709
about as uh
as concepts as world models as common

5600
01:34:28,709 --> 01:34:28,719
as concepts as world models as common
 

5601
01:34:28,719 --> 01:34:29,590
as concepts as world models as common
sense

5602
01:34:29,590 --> 01:34:29,600
sense
 

5603
01:34:29,600 --> 01:34:32,070
sense
is that possible no i don't think it is

5604
01:34:32,070 --> 01:34:32,080
is that possible no i don't think it is
 

5605
01:34:32,080 --> 01:34:33,590
is that possible no i don't think it is
possible because the information is not

5606
01:34:33,590 --> 01:34:33,600
possible because the information is not
 

5607
01:34:33,600 --> 01:34:33,990
possible because the information is not
there

5608
01:34:33,990 --> 01:34:34,000
there
 

5609
01:34:34,000 --> 01:34:37,350
there
well the information is uh is there

5610
01:34:37,350 --> 01:34:37,360
well the information is uh is there
 

5611
01:34:37,360 --> 01:34:38,390
well the information is uh is there
behind the text

5612
01:34:38,390 --> 01:34:38,400
behind the text
 

5613
01:34:38,400 --> 01:34:40,149
behind the text
right now unless somebody has written

5614
01:34:40,149 --> 01:34:40,159
right now unless somebody has written
 

5615
01:34:40,159 --> 01:34:41,669
right now unless somebody has written
down all the details

5616
01:34:41,669 --> 01:34:41,679
down all the details
 

5617
01:34:41,679 --> 01:34:44,470
down all the details
about how everything works in the world

5618
01:34:44,470 --> 01:34:44,480
about how everything works in the world
 

5619
01:34:44,480 --> 01:34:45,109
about how everything works in the world
to the

5620
01:34:45,109 --> 01:34:45,119
to the
 

5621
01:34:45,119 --> 01:34:47,030
to the
the absurd amounts like okay it is

5622
01:34:47,030 --> 01:34:47,040
the absurd amounts like okay it is
 

5623
01:34:47,040 --> 01:34:48,390
the absurd amounts like okay it is
easier to walk

5624
01:34:48,390 --> 01:34:48,400
easier to walk
 

5625
01:34:48,400 --> 01:34:50,709
easier to walk
forward than backward uh that you have

5626
01:34:50,709 --> 01:34:50,719
forward than backward uh that you have
 

5627
01:34:50,719 --> 01:34:52,709
forward than backward uh that you have
to open the door to go out of the thing

5628
01:34:52,709 --> 01:34:52,719
to open the door to go out of the thing
 

5629
01:34:52,719 --> 01:34:55,270
to open the door to go out of the thing
uh doctors wear underwear you know

5630
01:34:55,270 --> 01:34:55,280
uh doctors wear underwear you know
 

5631
01:34:55,280 --> 01:34:55,750
uh doctors wear underwear you know
unless

5632
01:34:55,750 --> 01:34:55,760
unless
 

5633
01:34:55,760 --> 01:34:57,030
unless
all these things somebody has written

5634
01:34:57,030 --> 01:34:57,040
all these things somebody has written
 

5635
01:34:57,040 --> 01:34:59,030
all these things somebody has written
down somewhere or you know somehow the

5636
01:34:59,030 --> 01:34:59,040
down somewhere or you know somehow the
 

5637
01:34:59,040 --> 01:35:00,470
down somewhere or you know somehow the
program found it to be useful for

5638
01:35:00,470 --> 01:35:00,480
program found it to be useful for
 

5639
01:35:00,480 --> 01:35:01,270
program found it to be useful for
compression

5640
01:35:01,270 --> 01:35:01,280
compression
 

5641
01:35:01,280 --> 01:35:03,990
compression
from some other text uh the information

5642
01:35:03,990 --> 01:35:04,000
from some other text uh the information
 

5643
01:35:04,000 --> 01:35:05,030
from some other text uh the information
is not there

5644
01:35:05,030 --> 01:35:05,040
is not there
 

5645
01:35:05,040 --> 01:35:07,350
is not there
so that's an argument that like text is

5646
01:35:07,350 --> 01:35:07,360
so that's an argument that like text is
 

5647
01:35:07,360 --> 01:35:09,590
so that's an argument that like text is
a lot lower fidelity than

5648
01:35:09,590 --> 01:35:09,600
a lot lower fidelity than
 

5649
01:35:09,600 --> 01:35:12,390
a lot lower fidelity than
the you know the experience of our

5650
01:35:12,390 --> 01:35:12,400
the you know the experience of our
 

5651
01:35:12,400 --> 01:35:13,109
the you know the experience of our
physical world

5652
01:35:13,109 --> 01:35:13,119
physical world
 

5653
01:35:13,119 --> 01:35:15,430
physical world
like right so you can use a thousand

5654
01:35:15,430 --> 01:35:15,440
like right so you can use a thousand
 

5655
01:35:15,440 --> 01:35:16,470
like right so you can use a thousand
words like that

5656
01:35:16,470 --> 01:35:16,480
words like that
 

5657
01:35:16,480 --> 01:35:18,950
words like that
kind of thing well in this case pictures

5658
01:35:18,950 --> 01:35:18,960
kind of thing well in this case pictures
 

5659
01:35:18,960 --> 01:35:19,669
kind of thing well in this case pictures
aren't really

5660
01:35:19,669 --> 01:35:19,679
aren't really
 

5661
01:35:19,679 --> 01:35:23,030
aren't really
so the the richest aspect of the

5662
01:35:23,030 --> 01:35:23,040
so the the richest aspect of the
 

5663
01:35:23,040 --> 01:35:24,149
so the the richest aspect of the
physical world isn't

5664
01:35:24,149 --> 01:35:24,159
physical world isn't
 

5665
01:35:24,159 --> 01:35:27,030
physical world isn't
even just pictures it's the uh it's the

5666
01:35:27,030 --> 01:35:27,040
even just pictures it's the uh it's the
 

5667
01:35:27,040 --> 01:35:28,790
even just pictures it's the uh it's the
interactivity of the world

5668
01:35:28,790 --> 01:35:28,800
interactivity of the world
 

5669
01:35:28,800 --> 01:35:32,550
interactivity of the world
yeah it's being able to um

5670
01:35:32,550 --> 01:35:32,560
yeah it's being able to um
 

5671
01:35:32,560 --> 01:35:36,790
yeah it's being able to um
yeah interact it's almost like

5672
01:35:36,790 --> 01:35:36,800

 

5673
01:35:36,800 --> 01:35:39,510

it's almost like if you could interact

5674
01:35:39,510 --> 01:35:39,520
it's almost like if you could interact
 

5675
01:35:39,520 --> 01:35:39,990
it's almost like if you could interact
so i

5676
01:35:39,990 --> 01:35:40,000
so i
 

5677
01:35:40,000 --> 01:35:42,390
so i
i i disagree well maybe i agree with you

5678
01:35:42,390 --> 01:35:42,400
i i disagree well maybe i agree with you
 

5679
01:35:42,400 --> 01:35:43,910
i i disagree well maybe i agree with you
that picture's worth a thousand words

5680
01:35:43,910 --> 01:35:43,920
that picture's worth a thousand words
 

5681
01:35:43,920 --> 01:35:44,709
that picture's worth a thousand words
but

5682
01:35:44,709 --> 01:35:44,719
but
 

5683
01:35:44,719 --> 01:35:47,189
but
a thousand it's still yeah you could say

5684
01:35:47,189 --> 01:35:47,199
a thousand it's still yeah you could say
 

5685
01:35:47,199 --> 01:35:49,189
a thousand it's still yeah you could say
you could capture it with the gpt

5686
01:35:49,189 --> 01:35:49,199
you could capture it with the gpt
 

5687
01:35:49,199 --> 01:35:50,870
you could capture it with the gpt
x so i wonder if there's some

5688
01:35:50,870 --> 01:35:50,880
x so i wonder if there's some
 

5689
01:35:50,880 --> 01:35:52,470
x so i wonder if there's some
interactive element where

5690
01:35:52,470 --> 01:35:52,480
interactive element where
 

5691
01:35:52,480 --> 01:35:54,310
interactive element where
a system could live in text world where

5692
01:35:54,310 --> 01:35:54,320
a system could live in text world where
 

5693
01:35:54,320 --> 01:35:56,070
a system could live in text world where
it could uh be part of the

5694
01:35:56,070 --> 01:35:56,080
it could uh be part of the
 

5695
01:35:56,080 --> 01:35:59,350
it could uh be part of the
chat be part of you know talking to

5696
01:35:59,350 --> 01:35:59,360
chat be part of you know talking to
 

5697
01:35:59,360 --> 01:36:00,310
chat be part of you know talking to
people

5698
01:36:00,310 --> 01:36:00,320
people
 

5699
01:36:00,320 --> 01:36:01,990
people
it's it's interesting i mean

5700
01:36:01,990 --> 01:36:02,000
it's it's interesting i mean
 

5701
01:36:02,000 --> 01:36:03,669
it's it's interesting i mean
fundamentally so

5702
01:36:03,669 --> 01:36:03,679
fundamentally so
 

5703
01:36:03,679 --> 01:36:05,510
fundamentally so
you're making a statement about the

5704
01:36:05,510 --> 01:36:05,520
you're making a statement about the
 

5705
01:36:05,520 --> 01:36:07,590
you're making a statement about the
limitation of text

5706
01:36:07,590 --> 01:36:07,600
limitation of text
 

5707
01:36:07,600 --> 01:36:11,030
limitation of text
okay let's so let's say we have a text

5708
01:36:11,030 --> 01:36:11,040
okay let's so let's say we have a text
 

5709
01:36:11,040 --> 01:36:15,910
okay let's so let's say we have a text
corpus that includes basically

5710
01:36:15,910 --> 01:36:15,920
corpus that includes basically
 

5711
01:36:15,920 --> 01:36:18,149
corpus that includes basically
every experience we could possibly have

5712
01:36:18,149 --> 01:36:18,159
every experience we could possibly have
 

5713
01:36:18,159 --> 01:36:21,109
every experience we could possibly have
i mean just a very large corpus of text

5714
01:36:21,109 --> 01:36:21,119
i mean just a very large corpus of text
 

5715
01:36:21,119 --> 01:36:23,510
i mean just a very large corpus of text
and also interactive components i guess

5716
01:36:23,510 --> 01:36:23,520
and also interactive components i guess
 

5717
01:36:23,520 --> 01:36:25,109
and also interactive components i guess
the question is whether the neural

5718
01:36:25,109 --> 01:36:25,119
the question is whether the neural
 

5719
01:36:25,119 --> 01:36:26,870
the question is whether the neural
network architecture these very

5720
01:36:26,870 --> 01:36:26,880
network architecture these very
 

5721
01:36:26,880 --> 01:36:30,310
network architecture these very
simple transformers but if they had like

5722
01:36:30,310 --> 01:36:30,320
simple transformers but if they had like
 

5723
01:36:30,320 --> 01:36:33,990
simple transformers but if they had like
hundreds of trillions or whatever comes

5724
01:36:33,990 --> 01:36:34,000
hundreds of trillions or whatever comes
 

5725
01:36:34,000 --> 01:36:35,430
hundreds of trillions or whatever comes
after a trillion

5726
01:36:35,430 --> 01:36:35,440
after a trillion
 

5727
01:36:35,440 --> 01:36:39,830
after a trillion
parameters whether that could store

5728
01:36:39,830 --> 01:36:39,840
parameters whether that could store
 

5729
01:36:39,840 --> 01:36:43,030
parameters whether that could store
the information needed that's

5730
01:36:43,030 --> 01:36:43,040
the information needed that's
 

5731
01:36:43,040 --> 01:36:44,310
the information needed that's
architecturally do you have

5732
01:36:44,310 --> 01:36:44,320
architecturally do you have
 

5733
01:36:44,320 --> 01:36:45,510
architecturally do you have
like do you have thoughts about the

5734
01:36:45,510 --> 01:36:45,520
like do you have thoughts about the
 

5735
01:36:45,520 --> 01:36:47,430
like do you have thoughts about the
limitation on that side of

5736
01:36:47,430 --> 01:36:47,440
limitation on that side of
 

5737
01:36:47,440 --> 01:36:50,390
limitation on that side of
things with neural networks i mean so

5738
01:36:50,390 --> 01:36:50,400
things with neural networks i mean so
 

5739
01:36:50,400 --> 01:36:52,070
things with neural networks i mean so
transformer is you know still a feed

5740
01:36:52,070 --> 01:36:52,080
transformer is you know still a feed
 

5741
01:36:52,080 --> 01:36:53,750
transformer is you know still a feed
forward neural network this uh

5742
01:36:53,750 --> 01:36:53,760
forward neural network this uh
 

5743
01:36:53,760 --> 01:36:56,470
forward neural network this uh
uh it's it has a very uh interesting

5744
01:36:56,470 --> 01:36:56,480
uh it's it has a very uh interesting
 

5745
01:36:56,480 --> 01:36:58,149
uh it's it has a very uh interesting
architecture which is good for

5746
01:36:58,149 --> 01:36:58,159
architecture which is good for
 

5747
01:36:58,159 --> 01:36:59,750
architecture which is good for
uh text modeling and probably some

5748
01:36:59,750 --> 01:36:59,760
uh text modeling and probably some
 

5749
01:36:59,760 --> 01:37:01,990
uh text modeling and probably some
aspects of uh video modeling but it is

5750
01:37:01,990 --> 01:37:02,000
aspects of uh video modeling but it is
 

5751
01:37:02,000 --> 01:37:03,990
aspects of uh video modeling but it is
still a feed forward architecture and

5752
01:37:03,990 --> 01:37:04,000
still a feed forward architecture and
 

5753
01:37:04,000 --> 01:37:06,149
still a feed forward architecture and
you believe in the feedback mechanism

5754
01:37:06,149 --> 01:37:06,159
you believe in the feedback mechanism
 

5755
01:37:06,159 --> 01:37:07,270
you believe in the feedback mechanism
the recursion oh

5756
01:37:07,270 --> 01:37:07,280
the recursion oh
 

5757
01:37:07,280 --> 01:37:10,070
the recursion oh
and and also because you know causality

5758
01:37:10,070 --> 01:37:10,080
and and also because you know causality
 

5759
01:37:10,080 --> 01:37:11,830
and and also because you know causality
you know being able to do counterfactual

5760
01:37:11,830 --> 01:37:11,840
you know being able to do counterfactual
 

5761
01:37:11,840 --> 01:37:12,709
you know being able to do counterfactual
reasoning

5762
01:37:12,709 --> 01:37:12,719
reasoning
 

5763
01:37:12,719 --> 01:37:14,709
reasoning
being able to do you know intervention

5764
01:37:14,709 --> 01:37:14,719
being able to do you know intervention
 

5765
01:37:14,719 --> 01:37:16,070
being able to do you know intervention
so which is uh uh

5766
01:37:16,070 --> 01:37:16,080
so which is uh uh
 

5767
01:37:16,080 --> 01:37:19,430
so which is uh uh
um actions in the world uh so

5768
01:37:19,430 --> 01:37:19,440
um actions in the world uh so
 

5769
01:37:19,440 --> 01:37:21,590
um actions in the world uh so
all those things uh require different

5770
01:37:21,590 --> 01:37:21,600
all those things uh require different
 

5771
01:37:21,600 --> 01:37:23,510
all those things uh require different
kinds of models to be built

5772
01:37:23,510 --> 01:37:23,520
kinds of models to be built
 

5773
01:37:23,520 --> 01:37:27,030
kinds of models to be built
uh i i don't think uh transformers uh

5774
01:37:27,030 --> 01:37:27,040
uh i i don't think uh transformers uh
 

5775
01:37:27,040 --> 01:37:29,830
uh i i don't think uh transformers uh
captures that uh family it is very good

5776
01:37:29,830 --> 01:37:29,840
captures that uh family it is very good
 

5777
01:37:29,840 --> 01:37:31,830
captures that uh family it is very good
at statistical modeling of

5778
01:37:31,830 --> 01:37:31,840
at statistical modeling of
 

5779
01:37:31,840 --> 01:37:34,550
at statistical modeling of
text uh yeah and and it will become

5780
01:37:34,550 --> 01:37:34,560
text uh yeah and and it will become
 

5781
01:37:34,560 --> 01:37:36,070
text uh yeah and and it will become
better and better with more data

5782
01:37:36,070 --> 01:37:36,080
better and better with more data
 

5783
01:37:36,080 --> 01:37:39,590
better and better with more data
uh bigger models but that is only going

5784
01:37:39,590 --> 01:37:39,600
uh bigger models but that is only going
 

5785
01:37:39,600 --> 01:37:40,390

know that's not what you ask a system to
 

5809
01:38:02,239 --> 01:38:02,950

uh so calm down internet uh so i just
 

5847
01:38:38,159 --> 01:38:41,750
uh so calm down internet uh so i just
i'm curious almost

5848
01:38:41,750 --> 01:38:41,760
i'm curious almost
 

5849
01:38:41,760 --> 01:38:44,950
i'm curious almost
in which ways will a dumb but

5850
01:38:44,950 --> 01:38:44,960
in which ways will a dumb but

large neural network will surprise us
 

5853
01:38:48,159 --> 01:38:51,430
large neural network will surprise us
yeah so like i'm it's kind of your i

5854
01:38:51,430 --> 01:38:51,440
yeah so like i'm it's kind of your i
 

5855
01:38:51,440 --> 01:38:53,350
yeah so like i'm it's kind of your i
completely agree with your intuition

5856
01:38:53,350 --> 01:38:53,360
completely agree with your intuition
 

5857
01:38:53,360 --> 01:38:56,830
completely agree with your intuition
it's just that i don't want to

5858
01:38:56,830 --> 01:38:56,840
it's just that i don't want to
 

5859
01:38:56,840 --> 01:38:59,430
it's just that i don't want to
dogmatically like 100 percent

01:38:59,430 --> 01:38:59,440
dogmatically like 100 percent
 

5861
01:38:59,440 --> 01:39:01,510
dogmatically like 100 percent
put all the chips there right it's we've

5862
01:39:01,510 --> 01:39:01,520
put all the chips there right it's we've
 

5863
01:39:01,520 --> 01:39:02,870
put all the chips there right it's we've
been surprised

5864
01:39:02,870 --> 01:39:02,880
been surprised
 

5865
01:39:02,880 --> 01:39:06,229
been surprised
so much even the current gpt 2 and

5866
01:39:06,229 --> 01:39:06,239
so much even the current gpt 2 and
 

5867
01:39:06,239 --> 01:39:09,750
so much even the current gpt 2 and
3 are so surprising yeah uh

5868
01:39:09,750 --> 01:39:09,760
3 are so surprising yeah uh
 

5869
01:39:09,760 --> 01:39:13,189
3 are so surprising yeah uh

01:39:16,639 --> 01:39:18,709
are really surprising and
i the reinforcement the fact that

the fact that neural networks work at
 

5881
01:39:23,520 --> 01:39:25,189
the fact that neural networks work at
all is quite surprising

all is quite surprising
 

5883
01:39:25,199 --> 01:39:27,750
all is quite surprising

01:39:32,400 --> 01:39:33,990
local minima that are at all reasonable
it's very surprising so

5890
01:39:33,990 --> 01:39:34,000
it's very surprising so
 

5891
01:39:34,000 --> 01:39:37,990
it's very surprising so
it uh i i wonder sometimes

5892
01:39:37,990 --> 01:39:38,000
it uh i i wonder sometimes
 

5893
01:39:38,000 --> 01:39:42,229
it uh i i wonder sometimes
whether us humans just want

5894
01:39:42,229 --> 01:39:42,239
whether us humans just want
 

5895
01:39:42,239 --> 01:39:45,910
whether us humans just want
it to not the for agi not to be such a

5896
01:39:45,910 --> 01:39:45,920
it to not the for agi not to be such a
 

5897
01:39:45,920 --> 01:39:47,830
it to not the for agi not to be such a
dumb thing

5898
01:39:47,830 --> 01:39:47,840
dumb thing
 

5899
01:39:47,840 --> 01:39:51,030
dumb thing
so i just because exactly what you're

5900
01:39:51,030 --> 01:39:51,040
so i just because exactly what you're
 

5901
01:39:51,040 --> 01:39:52,629
so i just because exactly what you're
saying is like

5902
01:39:52,629 --> 01:39:52,639
saying is like
 

5903
01:39:52,639 --> 01:39:54,470
saying is like
the ideas of concepts and be able to

5904
01:39:54,470 --> 01:39:54,480
the ideas of concepts and be able to
 

5905
01:39:54,480 --> 01:39:56,149
the ideas of concepts and be able to
reason with those concepts and

5906
01:39:56,149 --> 01:39:56,159
reason with those concepts and
 

5907
01:39:56,159 --> 01:39:58,790
reason with those concepts and
and connect those concepts in uh like

5908
01:39:58,790 --> 01:39:58,800
and connect those concepts in uh like
 

5909
01:39:58,800 --> 01:40:00,149
and connect those concepts in uh like
hierarchical ways

5910
01:40:00,149 --> 01:40:00,159
hierarchical ways
 

5911
01:40:00,159 --> 01:40:02,950
hierarchical ways
and then to be able to have uh world

5912
01:40:02,950 --> 01:40:02,960
and then to be able to have uh world
 

5913
01:40:02,960 --> 01:40:03,910
and then to be able to have uh world
models i mean just

5914
01:40:03,910 --> 01:40:03,920
models i mean just
 

5915
01:40:03,920 --> 01:40:05,990
models i mean just
everything we're describing in human

5916
01:40:05,990 --> 01:40:06,000
everything we're describing in human
 

5917
01:40:06,000 --> 01:40:08,390
everything we're describing in human
language in this poetic way

5918
01:40:08,390 --> 01:40:08,400
language in this poetic way
 

5919
01:40:08,400 --> 01:40:10,070
language in this poetic way
seems to make sense that that is what

5920
01:40:10,070 --> 01:40:10,080
seems to make sense that that is what
 

5921
01:40:10,080 --> 01:40:11,990
seems to make sense that that is what
intelligence and reasoning are like i

5922
01:40:11,990 --> 01:40:12,000
intelligence and reasoning are like i
 

5923
01:40:12,000 --> 01:40:13,510
intelligence and reasoning are like i
i wonder if at the core of it it could

5924
01:40:13,510 --> 01:40:13,520
i wonder if at the core of it it could
 

5925
01:40:13,520 --> 01:40:15,030
i wonder if at the core of it it could
be much dumber

5926
01:40:15,030 --> 01:40:15,040
be much dumber
 

5927
01:40:15,040 --> 01:40:18,390
be much dumber
uh well finally it is still connections

5928
01:40:18,390 --> 01:40:18,400
uh well finally it is still connections
 

5929
01:40:18,400 --> 01:40:19,910
uh well finally it is still connections
and messages passing over them

5930
01:40:19,910 --> 01:40:19,920
and messages passing over them
 

5931
01:40:19,920 --> 01:40:23,669
and messages passing over them
right right so that way it's done

5932
01:40:23,669 --> 01:40:23,679
right right so that way it's done
 

5933
01:40:23,679 --> 01:40:25,750
right right so that way it's done
so i guess the recursion the the

5934
01:40:25,750 --> 01:40:25,760
so i guess the recursion the the
 

5935
01:40:25,760 --> 01:40:27,750
so i guess the recursion the the
feedback mechanism

5936
01:40:27,750 --> 01:40:27,760
feedback mechanism
 

5937
01:40:27,760 --> 01:40:29,510
feedback mechanism
that does seem to be a fundamental kind

5938
01:40:29,510 --> 01:40:29,520
that does seem to be a fundamental kind
 

5939
01:40:29,520 --> 01:40:31,350
that does seem to be a fundamental kind
of thing um

5940
01:40:31,350 --> 01:40:31,360
of thing um
 

5941
01:40:31,360 --> 01:40:34,830
of thing um
yeah yeah the idea of concepts also

5942
01:40:34,830 --> 01:40:34,840
yeah yeah the idea of concepts also
 

5943
01:40:34,840 --> 01:40:35,990
yeah yeah the idea of concepts also
memory

5944
01:40:35,990 --> 01:40:36,000
memory
 

5945
01:40:36,000 --> 01:40:38,550
memory
correct like having an episodic memory

5946
01:40:38,550 --> 01:40:38,560
correct like having an episodic memory
 

5947
01:40:38,560 --> 01:40:39,350
correct like having an episodic memory
yeah yeah

5948
01:40:39,350 --> 01:40:39,360
yeah yeah
 

5949
01:40:39,360 --> 01:40:41,669
yeah yeah
that seems to be an important thing so

5950
01:40:41,669 --> 01:40:41,679
that seems to be an important thing so
 

5951
01:40:41,679 --> 01:40:43,109
that seems to be an important thing so
how do we get memory

5952
01:40:43,109 --> 01:40:43,119
how do we get memory
 

5953
01:40:43,119 --> 01:40:44,870
how do we get memory
so yeah we have another piece of work

5954
01:40:44,870 --> 01:40:44,880
so yeah we have another piece of work
 

5955
01:40:44,880 --> 01:40:47,270
so yeah we have another piece of work
that which came out recently on

5956
01:40:47,270 --> 01:40:47,280
that which came out recently on
 

5957
01:40:47,280 --> 01:40:50,149
that which came out recently on
how do you form episodic memories and

5958
01:40:50,149 --> 01:40:50,159
how do you form episodic memories and
 

5959
01:40:50,159 --> 01:40:51,910
how do you form episodic memories and
and form abstractions from them

5960
01:40:51,910 --> 01:40:51,920
and form abstractions from them
 

5961
01:40:51,920 --> 01:40:54,870
and form abstractions from them
uh and we haven't figured out a you know

5962
01:40:54,870 --> 01:40:54,880
uh and we haven't figured out a you know
 

5963
01:40:54,880 --> 01:40:55,990
uh and we haven't figured out a you know
all the connections of that to the

5964
01:40:55,990 --> 01:40:56,000
all the connections of that to the
 

5965
01:40:56,000 --> 01:40:57,750
all the connections of that to the
overall cognitive architecture

5966
01:40:57,750 --> 01:40:57,760
overall cognitive architecture
 

5967
01:40:57,760 --> 01:41:00,229
overall cognitive architecture
but um well yeah what are your ideas

5968
01:41:00,229 --> 01:41:00,239
but um well yeah what are your ideas
 

5969
01:41:00,239 --> 01:41:01,030
but um well yeah what are your ideas
about

5970
01:41:01,030 --> 01:41:01,040
about
 

5971
01:41:01,040 --> 01:41:03,669
about
how you could have episodic memory so at

5972
01:41:03,669 --> 01:41:03,679
how you could have episodic memory so at
 

5973
01:41:03,679 --> 01:41:05,350
how you could have episodic memory so at
least it's very clear that

5974
01:41:05,350 --> 01:41:05,360
least it's very clear that
 

5975
01:41:05,360 --> 01:41:06,870
least it's very clear that
there you need to have two kinds of

5976
01:41:06,870 --> 01:41:06,880
there you need to have two kinds of
 

5977
01:41:06,880 --> 01:41:08,629
there you need to have two kinds of
memory right that that's very very clear

5978
01:41:08,629 --> 01:41:08,639
memory right that that's very very clear
 

5979
01:41:08,639 --> 01:41:09,590
memory right that that's very very clear
right because

5980
01:41:09,590 --> 01:41:09,600
right because
 

5981
01:41:09,600 --> 01:41:13,590
right because
there are things that happen uh

5982
01:41:13,590 --> 01:41:13,600
there are things that happen uh
 

5983
01:41:13,600 --> 01:41:16,149
there are things that happen uh
as statistical patterns in the world uh

5984
01:41:16,149 --> 01:41:16,159
as statistical patterns in the world uh
 

5985
01:41:16,159 --> 01:41:17,669
as statistical patterns in the world uh
but then there is the

5986
01:41:17,669 --> 01:41:17,679
but then there is the
 

5987
01:41:17,679 --> 01:41:19,830
but then there is the
the one timeline of things that happen

5988
01:41:19,830 --> 01:41:19,840
the one timeline of things that happen
 

5989
01:41:19,840 --> 01:41:21,189
the one timeline of things that happen
only once in your life right

5990
01:41:21,189 --> 01:41:21,199
only once in your life right
 

5991
01:41:21,199 --> 01:41:23,350
only once in your life right
uh uh and this day is not going to

5992
01:41:23,350 --> 01:41:23,360
uh uh and this day is not going to
 

5993
01:41:23,360 --> 01:41:25,590
uh uh and this day is not going to
happen ever again and and so

5994
01:41:25,590 --> 01:41:25,600
happen ever again and and so
 

5995
01:41:25,600 --> 01:41:28,390
happen ever again and and so
and that needs to be stored as a as a

5996
01:41:28,390 --> 01:41:28,400
and that needs to be stored as a as a
 

5997
01:41:28,400 --> 01:41:28,790
and that needs to be stored as a as a
you know

5998
01:41:28,790 --> 01:41:28,800
you know
 

5999
01:41:28,800 --> 01:41:31,990
you know
just a stream of uh string right this is

6000
01:41:31,990 --> 01:41:32,000
just a stream of uh string right this is
 

6001
01:41:32,000 --> 01:41:34,390
just a stream of uh string right this is
this is my experience and then then the

6002
01:41:34,390 --> 01:41:34,400
this is my experience and then then the
 

6003
01:41:34,400 --> 01:41:35,270
this is my experience and then then the
question is

6004
01:41:35,270 --> 01:41:35,280
question is
 

6005
01:41:35,280 --> 01:41:38,149
question is
about how do you take that experience

6006
01:41:38,149 --> 01:41:38,159
about how do you take that experience
 

6007
01:41:38,159 --> 01:41:39,750
about how do you take that experience
and connect it to the statistical part

6008
01:41:39,750 --> 01:41:39,760
and connect it to the statistical part
 

6009
01:41:39,760 --> 01:41:40,870
and connect it to the statistical part
of it how do you

6010
01:41:40,870 --> 01:41:40,880
of it how do you
 

6011
01:41:40,880 --> 01:41:42,790
of it how do you
now say that okay i experienced this

6012
01:41:42,790 --> 01:41:42,800
now say that okay i experienced this
 

6013
01:41:42,800 --> 01:41:45,189
now say that okay i experienced this
thing now i want to

6014
01:41:45,189 --> 01:41:45,199
thing now i want to
 

6015
01:41:45,199 --> 01:41:48,229
thing now i want to
be careful about similar situations uh

6016
01:41:48,229 --> 01:41:48,239
be careful about similar situations uh
 

6017
01:41:48,239 --> 01:41:49,030
be careful about similar situations uh
and so

6018
01:41:49,030 --> 01:41:49,040
and so
 

6019
01:41:49,040 --> 01:41:51,830
and so
so you need to be able to index that

6020
01:41:51,830 --> 01:41:51,840
so you need to be able to index that
 

6021
01:41:51,840 --> 01:41:53,109
so you need to be able to index that
similarity

6022
01:41:53,109 --> 01:41:53,119
similarity
 

6023
01:41:53,119 --> 01:41:56,629
similarity
using your other giant status

6024
01:41:56,629 --> 01:41:56,639
using your other giant status
 

6025
01:41:56,639 --> 01:41:58,310
using your other giant status
you know the the model of the world that

6026
01:41:58,310 --> 01:41:58,320
you know the the model of the world that
 

6027
01:41:58,320 --> 01:42:00,070
you know the the model of the world that
you have learned although the situation

6028
01:42:00,070 --> 01:42:00,080
you have learned although the situation
 

6029
01:42:00,080 --> 01:42:01,750
you have learned although the situation
came from the episode you need to be

6030
01:42:01,750 --> 01:42:01,760
came from the episode you need to be
 

6031
01:42:01,760 --> 01:42:04,070
came from the episode you need to be
able to index the other one so

6032
01:42:04,070 --> 01:42:04,080
able to index the other one so
 

6033
01:42:04,080 --> 01:42:07,669
able to index the other one so
uh the episodic memory

6034
01:42:07,669 --> 01:42:07,679
uh the episodic memory
 

6035
01:42:07,679 --> 01:42:10,950
uh the episodic memory
being implemented as an indexing over

6036
01:42:10,950 --> 01:42:10,960
being implemented as an indexing over
 

6037
01:42:10,960 --> 01:42:11,750
being implemented as an indexing over
the

6038
01:42:11,750 --> 01:42:11,760
the
 

6039
01:42:11,760 --> 01:42:15,189
the
other uh model that you're building

6040
01:42:15,189 --> 01:42:15,199
other uh model that you're building
 

6041
01:42:15,199 --> 01:42:20,470
other uh model that you're building
so the memories remain and they uh

6042
01:42:20,470 --> 01:42:20,480
so the memories remain and they uh
 

6043
01:42:20,480 --> 01:42:23,189
so the memories remain and they uh
they they're an index into this like the

6044
01:42:23,189 --> 01:42:23,199
they they're an index into this like the
 

6045
01:42:23,199 --> 01:42:24,950
they they're an index into this like the
statistical thing that you formed yeah

6046
01:42:24,950 --> 01:42:24,960
statistical thing that you formed yeah
 

6047
01:42:24,960 --> 01:42:25,750
statistical thing that you formed yeah
statistical

6048
01:42:25,750 --> 01:42:25,760
statistical
 

6049
01:42:25,760 --> 01:42:27,590
statistical
causal structural model that you built

6050
01:42:27,590 --> 01:42:27,600
causal structural model that you built
 

6051
01:42:27,600 --> 01:42:28,950
causal structural model that you built
over over time

6052
01:42:28,950 --> 01:42:28,960
over over time
 

6053
01:42:28,960 --> 01:42:31,990
over over time
so so it's basically the idea is that uh

6054
01:42:31,990 --> 01:42:32,000
so so it's basically the idea is that uh
 

6055
01:42:32,000 --> 01:42:32,950
so so it's basically the idea is that uh
the hippocampus

6056
01:42:32,950 --> 01:42:32,960
the hippocampus
 

6057
01:42:32,960 --> 01:42:35,990
the hippocampus
is uh just storing

6058
01:42:35,990 --> 01:42:36,000
is uh just storing
 

6059
01:42:36,000 --> 01:42:39,189
is uh just storing
or sequencing uh

6060
01:42:39,189 --> 01:42:39,199
or sequencing uh
 

6061
01:42:39,199 --> 01:42:41,430
or sequencing uh
in a set of pointers that happens over

6062
01:42:41,430 --> 01:42:41,440
in a set of pointers that happens over
 

6063
01:42:41,440 --> 01:42:42,310
in a set of pointers that happens over
time

6064
01:42:42,310 --> 01:42:42,320
time
 

6065
01:42:42,320 --> 01:42:43,750
time
and then whenever you want to

6066
01:42:43,750 --> 01:42:43,760
and then whenever you want to
 

6067
01:42:43,760 --> 01:42:46,149
and then whenever you want to
reconstitute that memory and evaluate

6068
01:42:46,149 --> 01:42:46,159
reconstitute that memory and evaluate
 

6069
01:42:46,159 --> 01:42:49,270
reconstitute that memory and evaluate
the different uh aspects of it whether

6070
01:42:49,270 --> 01:42:49,280
the different uh aspects of it whether
 

6071
01:42:49,280 --> 01:42:51,350
the different uh aspects of it whether
it was good bad do i need to encounter

6072
01:42:51,350 --> 01:42:51,360
it was good bad do i need to encounter
 

6073
01:42:51,360 --> 01:42:52,550
it was good bad do i need to encounter
the situation again

6074
01:42:52,550 --> 01:42:52,560
the situation again
 

6075
01:42:52,560 --> 01:42:56,550
the situation again
you need the cortex to reinstantiate to

6076
01:42:56,550 --> 01:42:56,560
you need the cortex to reinstantiate to
 

6077
01:42:56,560 --> 01:42:58,550
you need the cortex to reinstantiate to
replay that memory

6078
01:42:58,550 --> 01:42:58,560
replay that memory
 

6079
01:42:58,560 --> 01:43:00,629
replay that memory
so how do you find that memory like

6080
01:43:00,629 --> 01:43:00,639
so how do you find that memory like
 

6081
01:43:00,639 --> 01:43:02,070
so how do you find that memory like
which direction is the important

6082
01:43:02,070 --> 01:43:02,080
which direction is the important
 

6083
01:43:02,080 --> 01:43:03,270
which direction is the important
direction

6084
01:43:03,270 --> 01:43:03,280
direction
 

6085
01:43:03,280 --> 01:43:05,030
direction
both directions are units again

6086
01:43:05,030 --> 01:43:05,040
both directions are units again
 

6087
01:43:05,040 --> 01:43:06,709
both directions are units again
bi-directional

6088
01:43:06,709 --> 01:43:06,719
bi-directional
 

6089
01:43:06,719 --> 01:43:08,870
bi-directional
so i guess how do you retrieve the

6090
01:43:08,870 --> 01:43:08,880
so i guess how do you retrieve the
 

6091
01:43:08,880 --> 01:43:11,270
so i guess how do you retrieve the
memory so this is again hypothesis right

6092
01:43:11,270 --> 01:43:11,280
memory so this is again hypothesis right
 

6093
01:43:11,280 --> 01:43:12,310
memory so this is again hypothesis right
yeah we're making this work

6094
01:43:12,310 --> 01:43:12,320
yeah we're making this work
 

6095
01:43:12,320 --> 01:43:15,109
yeah we're making this work
so when you uh when you come to a new

6096
01:43:15,109 --> 01:43:15,119
so when you uh when you come to a new
 

6097
01:43:15,119 --> 01:43:16,629
so when you uh when you come to a new
situation right uh

6098
01:43:16,629 --> 01:43:16,639
situation right uh
 

6099
01:43:16,639 --> 01:43:19,750
situation right uh
your your cortex is doing inference uh

6100
01:43:19,750 --> 01:43:19,760
your your cortex is doing inference uh
 

6101
01:43:19,760 --> 01:43:20,149
your your cortex is doing inference uh
over

6102
01:43:20,149 --> 01:43:20,159
over
 

6103
01:43:20,159 --> 01:43:22,709
over
in the new situation and then of course

6104
01:43:22,709 --> 01:43:22,719
in the new situation and then of course
 

6105
01:43:22,719 --> 01:43:24,229
in the new situation and then of course
hippocampus is connected to different

6106
01:43:24,229 --> 01:43:24,239
hippocampus is connected to different
 

6107
01:43:24,239 --> 01:43:25,270
hippocampus is connected to different
parts of the cortex

6108
01:43:25,270 --> 01:43:25,280
parts of the cortex
 

6109
01:43:25,280 --> 01:43:28,229
parts of the cortex
um and and you have this deja vu

6110
01:43:28,229 --> 01:43:28,239
um and and you have this deja vu
 

6111
01:43:28,239 --> 01:43:29,590
um and and you have this deja vu
situation right

6112
01:43:29,590 --> 01:43:29,600
situation right
 

6113
01:43:29,600 --> 01:43:32,870
situation right
okay i have seen this thing before and

6114
01:43:32,870 --> 01:43:32,880
okay i have seen this thing before and
 

6115
01:43:32,880 --> 01:43:35,669
okay i have seen this thing before and
uh and then in the hippocampus you can

6116
01:43:35,669 --> 01:43:35,679
uh and then in the hippocampus you can
 

6117
01:43:35,679 --> 01:43:37,750
uh and then in the hippocampus you can
have an index of okay this is when it

6118
01:43:37,750 --> 01:43:37,760
have an index of okay this is when it
 

6119
01:43:37,760 --> 01:43:38,390
have an index of okay this is when it
happened

6120
01:43:38,390 --> 01:43:38,400
happened
 

6121
01:43:38,400 --> 01:43:41,750
happened
as a timeline uh and and and

6122
01:43:41,750 --> 01:43:41,760
as a timeline uh and and and
 

6123
01:43:41,760 --> 01:43:45,109
as a timeline uh and and and
then then you can use the hippocampus to

6124
01:43:45,109 --> 01:43:45,119
then then you can use the hippocampus to
 

6125
01:43:45,119 --> 01:43:47,750
then then you can use the hippocampus to
drive the the similar timelines to say

6126
01:43:47,750 --> 01:43:47,760
drive the the similar timelines to say
 

6127
01:43:47,760 --> 01:43:48,950
drive the the similar timelines to say
now i am i am

6128
01:43:48,950 --> 01:43:48,960
now i am i am
 

6129
01:43:48,960 --> 01:43:51,910
now i am i am
rather than being driven by my current

6130
01:43:51,910 --> 01:43:51,920
rather than being driven by my current
 

6131
01:43:51,920 --> 01:43:52,950
rather than being driven by my current
input stimuli

6132
01:43:52,950 --> 01:43:52,960
input stimuli
 

6133
01:43:52,960 --> 01:43:56,070
input stimuli
i am going back in time and rewinding my

6134
01:43:56,070 --> 01:43:56,080
i am going back in time and rewinding my
 

6135
01:43:56,080 --> 01:43:57,510
i am going back in time and rewinding my
experience for applying it

6136
01:43:57,510 --> 01:43:57,520
experience for applying it
 

6137
01:43:57,520 --> 01:43:59,030
experience for applying it
but putting back into the cortex and

6138
01:43:59,030 --> 01:43:59,040
but putting back into the cortex and
 

6139
01:43:59,040 --> 01:44:01,030
but putting back into the cortex and
then putting it back into the cortex of

6140
01:44:01,030 --> 01:44:01,040
then putting it back into the cortex of
 

6141
01:44:01,040 --> 01:44:01,430
then putting it back into the cortex of
course

6142
01:44:01,430 --> 01:44:01,440
course
 

6143
01:44:01,440 --> 01:44:03,830
course
affects what you're going to see next in

6144
01:44:03,830 --> 01:44:03,840
affects what you're going to see next in
 

6145
01:44:03,840 --> 01:44:05,030
affects what you're going to see next in
your current situation

6146
01:44:05,030 --> 01:44:05,040
your current situation
 

6147
01:44:05,040 --> 01:44:07,189
your current situation
got it yeah so that's that's the whole

6148
01:44:07,189 --> 01:44:07,199
got it yeah so that's that's the whole
 

6149
01:44:07,199 --> 01:44:09,350
got it yeah so that's that's the whole
thing having a world model and then

6150
01:44:09,350 --> 01:44:09,360
thing having a world model and then
 

6151
01:44:09,360 --> 01:44:11,669
thing having a world model and then
yeah uh connecting to the perception

6152
01:44:11,669 --> 01:44:11,679
yeah uh connecting to the perception
 

6153
01:44:11,679 --> 01:44:13,030
yeah uh connecting to the perception
yeah it does seem to be

6154
01:44:13,030 --> 01:44:13,040
yeah it does seem to be
 

6155
01:44:13,040 --> 01:44:16,070
yeah it does seem to be
that that's what's happening it'd be

6156
01:44:16,070 --> 01:44:16,080
that that's what's happening it'd be
 

6157
01:44:16,080 --> 01:44:18,709
that that's what's happening it'd be
on the neural network side it's um it's

6158
01:44:18,709 --> 01:44:18,719
on the neural network side it's um it's
 

6159
01:44:18,719 --> 01:44:20,390
on the neural network side it's um it's
interesting to think of how we actually

6160
01:44:20,390 --> 01:44:20,400
interesting to think of how we actually
 

6161
01:44:20,400 --> 01:44:21,590
interesting to think of how we actually
do that

6162
01:44:21,590 --> 01:44:21,600
do that
 

6163
01:44:21,600 --> 01:44:24,790
do that
yeah yeah to have a knowledge base

6164
01:44:24,790 --> 01:44:24,800
yeah yeah to have a knowledge base
 

6165
01:44:24,800 --> 01:44:27,270
yeah yeah to have a knowledge base
yes it is possible that you can put many

6166
01:44:27,270 --> 01:44:27,280
yes it is possible that you can put many
 

6167
01:44:27,280 --> 01:44:28,149
yes it is possible that you can put many
of these structures

6168
01:44:28,149 --> 01:44:28,159
of these structures
 

6169
01:44:28,159 --> 01:44:32,070
of these structures
into uh neural networks and we will find

6170
01:44:32,070 --> 01:44:32,080
into uh neural networks and we will find
 

6171
01:44:32,080 --> 01:44:35,430
into uh neural networks and we will find
ways of combining properties of

6172
01:44:35,430 --> 01:44:35,440
ways of combining properties of
 

6173
01:44:35,440 --> 01:44:38,950
ways of combining properties of
neural networks and graphical models so

6174
01:44:38,950 --> 01:44:38,960
neural networks and graphical models so
 

6175
01:44:38,960 --> 01:44:40,870
neural networks and graphical models so
uh i mean it's already started happening

6176
01:44:40,870 --> 01:44:40,880
uh i mean it's already started happening
 

6177
01:44:40,880 --> 01:44:42,870
uh i mean it's already started happening
yes uh graph neural networks are kind of

6178
01:44:42,870 --> 01:44:42,880
yes uh graph neural networks are kind of
 

6179
01:44:42,880 --> 01:44:44,550
yes uh graph neural networks are kind of
emerge between them

6180
01:44:44,550 --> 01:44:44,560
emerge between them
 

6181
01:44:44,560 --> 01:44:47,189
emerge between them
and there will be more of that thing so

6182
01:44:47,189 --> 01:44:47,199
and there will be more of that thing so
 

6183
01:44:47,199 --> 01:44:48,470
and there will be more of that thing so
but to me it is

6184
01:44:48,470 --> 01:44:48,480
but to me it is
 

6185
01:44:48,480 --> 01:44:51,510
but to me it is
the direction is pretty cl i mean

6186
01:44:51,510 --> 01:44:51,520
the direction is pretty cl i mean
 

6187
01:44:51,520 --> 01:44:53,590
the direction is pretty cl i mean
looking at biology and the histo history

6188
01:44:53,590 --> 01:44:53,600
looking at biology and the histo history
 

6189
01:44:53,600 --> 01:44:55,270
looking at biology and the histo history
of uh

6190
01:44:55,270 --> 01:44:55,280
of uh
 

6191
01:44:55,280 --> 01:44:57,669
of uh
uh evolutionary history of intelligence

6192
01:44:57,669 --> 01:44:57,679
uh evolutionary history of intelligence
 

6193
01:44:57,679 --> 01:44:59,750
uh evolutionary history of intelligence
it is pretty clear that

6194
01:44:59,750 --> 01:44:59,760
it is pretty clear that
 

6195
01:44:59,760 --> 01:45:02,629
it is pretty clear that
okay what does need is more structure in

6196
01:45:02,629 --> 01:45:02,639
okay what does need is more structure in
 

6197
01:45:02,639 --> 01:45:03,510
okay what does need is more structure in
the models

6198
01:45:03,510 --> 01:45:03,520
the models
 

6199
01:45:03,520 --> 01:45:06,550
the models
and modeling of the world and supporting

6200
01:45:06,550 --> 01:45:06,560
and modeling of the world and supporting
 

6201
01:45:06,560 --> 01:45:07,270
and modeling of the world and supporting
dynamic

6202
01:45:07,270 --> 01:45:07,280
dynamic
 

6203
01:45:07,280 --> 01:45:11,270
dynamic
inference well let me ask you uh

6204
01:45:11,270 --> 01:45:11,280
inference well let me ask you uh
 

6205
01:45:11,280 --> 01:45:12,950
inference well let me ask you uh
there's a guy named elon musk there's a

6206
01:45:12,950 --> 01:45:12,960
there's a guy named elon musk there's a
 

6207
01:45:12,960 --> 01:45:14,390
there's a guy named elon musk there's a
company called neurolink

6208
01:45:14,390 --> 01:45:14,400
company called neurolink
 

6209
01:45:14,400 --> 01:45:16,149
company called neurolink
and there's a general field called brain

6210
01:45:16,149 --> 01:45:16,159
and there's a general field called brain
 

6211
01:45:16,159 --> 01:45:17,750
and there's a general field called brain
computing interfaces yeah

6212
01:45:17,750 --> 01:45:17,760
computing interfaces yeah
 

6213
01:45:17,760 --> 01:45:21,350
computing interfaces yeah
um it's kind of uh interface between

6214
01:45:21,350 --> 01:45:21,360
um it's kind of uh interface between
 

6215
01:45:21,360 --> 01:45:22,149
um it's kind of uh interface between
your two

6216
01:45:22,149 --> 01:45:22,159
your two
 

6217
01:45:22,159 --> 01:45:25,350
your two
loves yes the brain and the intelligence

6218
01:45:25,350 --> 01:45:25,360
loves yes the brain and the intelligence
 

6219
01:45:25,360 --> 01:45:27,430
loves yes the brain and the intelligence
uh so there's like very direct

6220
01:45:27,430 --> 01:45:27,440
uh so there's like very direct
 

6221
01:45:27,440 --> 01:45:28,790
uh so there's like very direct
applications of brain computer

6222
01:45:28,790 --> 01:45:28,800
applications of brain computer
 

6223
01:45:28,800 --> 01:45:29,590
applications of brain computer
interfaces

6224
01:45:29,590 --> 01:45:29,600
interfaces
 

6225
01:45:29,600 --> 01:45:32,149
interfaces
for people with different conditions

6226
01:45:32,149 --> 01:45:32,159
for people with different conditions
 

6227
01:45:32,159 --> 01:45:33,270
for people with different conditions
more in the short term

6228
01:45:33,270 --> 01:45:33,280
more in the short term
 

6229
01:45:33,280 --> 01:45:35,030
more in the short term
yeah but there's also these sci-fi

6230
01:45:35,030 --> 01:45:35,040
yeah but there's also these sci-fi
 

6231
01:45:35,040 --> 01:45:37,830
yeah but there's also these sci-fi
futuristic kinds of ideas of

6232
01:45:37,830 --> 01:45:37,840
futuristic kinds of ideas of
 

6233
01:45:37,840 --> 01:45:41,030
futuristic kinds of ideas of
ai systems being able to

6234
01:45:41,030 --> 01:45:41,040
ai systems being able to
 

6235
01:45:41,040 --> 01:45:43,669
ai systems being able to
communicate in a high bandwidth way with

6236
01:45:43,669 --> 01:45:43,679
communicate in a high bandwidth way with
 

6237
01:45:43,679 --> 01:45:44,470
communicate in a high bandwidth way with
the brain

6238
01:45:44,470 --> 01:45:44,480
the brain
 

6239
01:45:44,480 --> 01:45:47,030
the brain
bi-directional yeah uh what are your

6240
01:45:47,030 --> 01:45:47,040
bi-directional yeah uh what are your
 

6241
01:45:47,040 --> 01:45:47,590
bi-directional yeah uh what are your
thoughts

6242
01:45:47,590 --> 01:45:47,600
thoughts
 

6243
01:45:47,600 --> 01:45:50,390
thoughts
about uh neural link and bci in general

6244
01:45:50,390 --> 01:45:50,400
about uh neural link and bci in general
 

6245
01:45:50,400 --> 01:45:52,390
about uh neural link and bci in general
as a possibility

6246
01:45:52,390 --> 01:45:52,400
as a possibility
 

6247
01:45:52,400 --> 01:45:55,590
as a possibility
so i think bca is a cool

6248
01:45:55,590 --> 01:45:55,600
so i think bca is a cool
 

6249
01:45:55,600 --> 01:45:59,109
so i think bca is a cool
research area and in fact um

6250
01:45:59,109 --> 01:45:59,119
research area and in fact um
 

6251
01:45:59,119 --> 01:46:00,950
research area and in fact um
when i got interested in brains

6252
01:46:00,950 --> 01:46:00,960
when i got interested in brains
 

6253
01:46:00,960 --> 01:46:02,310
when i got interested in brains
initially when you know so i was

6254
01:46:02,310 --> 01:46:02,320
initially when you know so i was
 

6255
01:46:02,320 --> 01:46:03,990
initially when you know so i was
enrolled at stanford and when i got

6256
01:46:03,990 --> 01:46:04,000
enrolled at stanford and when i got
 

6257
01:46:04,000 --> 01:46:05,669
enrolled at stanford and when i got
interested in brains it was it was

6258
01:46:05,669 --> 01:46:05,679
interested in brains it was it was
 

6259
01:46:05,679 --> 01:46:07,590
interested in brains it was it was
through a brain uh

6260
01:46:07,590 --> 01:46:07,600
through a brain uh
 

6261
01:46:07,600 --> 01:46:09,910
through a brain uh
computer interface talk that krishna

6262
01:46:09,910 --> 01:46:09,920
computer interface talk that krishna
 

6263
01:46:09,920 --> 01:46:11,270
computer interface talk that krishna
gave that's when i

6264
01:46:11,270 --> 01:46:11,280
gave that's when i
 

6265
01:46:11,280 --> 01:46:12,950
gave that's when i
even started thinking about the problem

6266
01:46:12,950 --> 01:46:12,960
even started thinking about the problem
 

6267
01:46:12,960 --> 01:46:15,750
even started thinking about the problem
so uh so it is definitely a fascinating

6268
01:46:15,750 --> 01:46:15,760
so uh so it is definitely a fascinating
 

6269
01:46:15,760 --> 01:46:17,109
so uh so it is definitely a fascinating
research area and it is

6270
01:46:17,109 --> 01:46:17,119
research area and it is
 

6271
01:46:17,119 --> 01:46:19,669
research area and it is
the applications are enormous right um

6272
01:46:19,669 --> 01:46:19,679
the applications are enormous right um
 

6273
01:46:19,679 --> 01:46:20,790
the applications are enormous right um
so

6274
01:46:20,790 --> 01:46:20,800
so
 

6275
01:46:20,800 --> 01:46:21,830
so
you know there is a science fiction

6276
01:46:21,830 --> 01:46:21,840
you know there is a science fiction
 

6277
01:46:21,840 --> 01:46:23,750
you know there is a science fiction
scenario of you know brains directly

6278
01:46:23,750 --> 01:46:23,760
scenario of you know brains directly
 

6279
01:46:23,760 --> 01:46:25,350
scenario of you know brains directly
communicating let's you know let's keep

6280
01:46:25,350 --> 01:46:25,360
communicating let's you know let's keep
 

6281
01:46:25,360 --> 01:46:25,990
communicating let's you know let's keep
that aside

6282
01:46:25,990 --> 01:46:26,000
that aside
 

6283
01:46:26,000 --> 01:46:29,030
that aside
for the time being uh even just the the

6284
01:46:29,030 --> 01:46:29,040
for the time being uh even just the the
 

6285
01:46:29,040 --> 01:46:30,870
for the time being uh even just the the
intermediate milestones that pursuing

6286
01:46:30,870 --> 01:46:30,880
intermediate milestones that pursuing
 

6287
01:46:30,880 --> 01:46:31,510
intermediate milestones that pursuing
which are

6288
01:46:31,510 --> 01:46:31,520
which are
 

6289
01:46:31,520 --> 01:46:33,830
which are
very reasonable as far as i can see uh

6290
01:46:33,830 --> 01:46:33,840
very reasonable as far as i can see uh
 

6291
01:46:33,840 --> 01:46:35,189
very reasonable as far as i can see uh
being able to control

6292
01:46:35,189 --> 01:46:35,199
being able to control
 

6293
01:46:35,199 --> 01:46:38,310
being able to control
an external limb using uh uh

6294
01:46:38,310 --> 01:46:38,320
an external limb using uh uh
 

6295
01:46:38,320 --> 01:46:40,629
an external limb using uh uh
in a direct connection from the brain

6296
01:46:40,629 --> 01:46:40,639
in a direct connection from the brain
 

6297
01:46:40,639 --> 01:46:42,470
in a direct connection from the brain
and being able to write things into the

6298
01:46:42,470 --> 01:46:42,480
and being able to write things into the
 

6299
01:46:42,480 --> 01:46:42,950
and being able to write things into the
brain

6300
01:46:42,950 --> 01:46:42,960
brain
 

6301
01:46:42,960 --> 01:46:46,709
brain
uh so so those are all uh

6302
01:46:46,709 --> 01:46:46,719
uh so so those are all uh
 

6303
01:46:46,719 --> 01:46:49,189
uh so so those are all uh
good steps to take and they have

6304
01:46:49,189 --> 01:46:49,199
good steps to take and they have
 

6305
01:46:49,199 --> 01:46:51,109
good steps to take and they have
enormous applications you know people

6306
01:46:51,109 --> 01:46:51,119
enormous applications you know people
 

6307
01:46:51,119 --> 01:46:53,270
enormous applications you know people
losing limbs being able to control

6308
01:46:53,270 --> 01:46:53,280
losing limbs being able to control
 

6309
01:46:53,280 --> 01:46:54,470
losing limbs being able to control
prosthetics

6310
01:46:54,470 --> 01:46:54,480
prosthetics
 

6311
01:46:54,480 --> 01:46:56,070
prosthetics
quadriplegics being able to control

6312
01:46:56,070 --> 01:46:56,080
quadriplegics being able to control
 

6313
01:46:56,080 --> 01:46:58,149
quadriplegics being able to control
something so

6314
01:46:58,149 --> 01:46:58,159
something so
 

6315
01:46:58,159 --> 01:47:00,149
something so
and therapeutics and you know i also

6316
01:47:00,149 --> 01:47:00,159
and therapeutics and you know i also
 

6317
01:47:00,159 --> 01:47:01,430
and therapeutics and you know i also
know about another company working in

6318
01:47:01,430 --> 01:47:01,440
know about another company working in
 

6319
01:47:01,440 --> 01:47:02,229
know about another company working in
the space

6320
01:47:02,229 --> 01:47:02,239
the space
 

6321
01:47:02,239 --> 01:47:04,390
the space
called paradromix they're doing you know

6322
01:47:04,390 --> 01:47:04,400
called paradromix they're doing you know
 

6323
01:47:04,400 --> 01:47:06,390
called paradromix they're doing you know
it's based on a different

6324
01:47:06,390 --> 01:47:06,400
it's based on a different
 

6325
01:47:06,400 --> 01:47:09,189
it's based on a different
uh electrode array but trying to attack

6326
01:47:09,189 --> 01:47:09,199
uh electrode array but trying to attack
 

6327
01:47:09,199 --> 01:47:10,870
uh electrode array but trying to attack
some of the same problems so i think

6328
01:47:10,870 --> 01:47:10,880
some of the same problems so i think
 

6329
01:47:10,880 --> 01:47:13,990
some of the same problems so i think
it's a very also surgery correct

6330
01:47:13,990 --> 01:47:14,000
it's a very also surgery correct
 

6331
01:47:14,000 --> 01:47:15,910
it's a very also surgery correct
surgically implanted electrons yeah

6332
01:47:15,910 --> 01:47:15,920
surgically implanted electrons yeah
 

6333
01:47:15,920 --> 01:47:20,070
surgically implanted electrons yeah
um so yeah i think of it as a

6334
01:47:20,070 --> 01:47:20,080
um so yeah i think of it as a
 

6335
01:47:20,080 --> 01:47:21,830
um so yeah i think of it as a
very very promising field especially

6336
01:47:21,830 --> 01:47:21,840
very very promising field especially
 

6337
01:47:21,840 --> 01:47:23,750
very very promising field especially
when it is helping people

6338
01:47:23,750 --> 01:47:23,760
when it is helping people
 

6339
01:47:23,760 --> 01:47:26,790
when it is helping people
overcome uh some limitations now at some

6340
01:47:26,790 --> 01:47:26,800
overcome uh some limitations now at some
 

6341
01:47:26,800 --> 01:47:27,189
overcome uh some limitations now at some
point

6342
01:47:27,189 --> 01:47:27,199
point
 

6343
01:47:27,199 --> 01:47:29,109
point
of course it will advance the level of

6344
01:47:29,109 --> 01:47:29,119
of course it will advance the level of
 

6345
01:47:29,119 --> 01:47:30,709
of course it will advance the level of
being able to communicate

6346
01:47:30,709 --> 01:47:30,719
being able to communicate
 

6347
01:47:30,719 --> 01:47:33,270
being able to communicate
uh how hard is that problem do you think

6348
01:47:33,270 --> 01:47:33,280
uh how hard is that problem do you think
 

6349
01:47:33,280 --> 01:47:33,990
uh how hard is that problem do you think
like so

6350
01:47:33,990 --> 01:47:34,000
like so
 

6351
01:47:34,000 --> 01:47:37,510
like so
so okay let's say we magically solve

6352
01:47:37,510 --> 01:47:37,520
so okay let's say we magically solve
 

6353
01:47:37,520 --> 01:47:40,149
so okay let's say we magically solve
what i think is a really hard problem of

6354
01:47:40,149 --> 01:47:40,159
what i think is a really hard problem of
 

6355
01:47:40,159 --> 01:47:40,550
what i think is a really hard problem of
doing

6356
01:47:40,550 --> 01:47:40,560
doing
 

6357
01:47:40,560 --> 01:47:44,310
doing
all of this safely yeah so so like

6358
01:47:44,310 --> 01:47:44,320
all of this safely yeah so so like
 

6359
01:47:44,320 --> 01:47:46,950
all of this safely yeah so so like
being able to uh connect electrodes and

6360
01:47:46,950 --> 01:47:46,960
being able to uh connect electrodes and
 

6361
01:47:46,960 --> 01:47:47,510
being able to uh connect electrodes and
not just

6362
01:47:47,510 --> 01:47:47,520
not just
 

6363
01:47:47,520 --> 01:47:50,470
not just
thousands but like millions to the right

6364
01:47:50,470 --> 01:47:50,480
thousands but like millions to the right
 

6365
01:47:50,480 --> 01:47:52,310
thousands but like millions to the right
i i think it's very very hard because

6366
01:47:52,310 --> 01:47:52,320
i i think it's very very hard because
 

6367
01:47:52,320 --> 01:47:53,270
i i think it's very very hard because
you also

6368
01:47:53,270 --> 01:47:53,280
you also
 

6369
01:47:53,280 --> 01:47:56,229
you also
do not know what the what will happen to

6370
01:47:56,229 --> 01:47:56,239
do not know what the what will happen to
 

6371
01:47:56,239 --> 01:47:56,870
do not know what the what will happen to
the brain

6372
01:47:56,870 --> 01:47:56,880
the brain
 

6373
01:47:56,880 --> 01:47:58,390
the brain
with that right in the sense of how does

6374
01:47:58,390 --> 01:47:58,400
with that right in the sense of how does
 

6375
01:47:58,400 --> 01:47:59,990
with that right in the sense of how does
the brain adapt to something like that

6376
01:47:59,990 --> 01:48:00,000
the brain adapt to something like that
 

6377
01:48:00,000 --> 01:48:02,149
the brain adapt to something like that
and it's you know as we're learning it's

6378
01:48:02,149 --> 01:48:02,159
and it's you know as we're learning it's
 

6379
01:48:02,159 --> 01:48:03,350
and it's you know as we're learning it's
the brain is

6380
01:48:03,350 --> 01:48:03,360
the brain is
 

6381
01:48:03,360 --> 01:48:06,149
the brain is
quite uh in terms of neuroplasticity

6382
01:48:06,149 --> 01:48:06,159
quite uh in terms of neuroplasticity
 

6383
01:48:06,159 --> 01:48:07,830
quite uh in terms of neuroplasticity
it's pretty malleable

6384
01:48:07,830 --> 01:48:07,840
it's pretty malleable
 

6385
01:48:07,840 --> 01:48:10,790
it's pretty malleable
so it's going to adjust so the machine

6386
01:48:10,790 --> 01:48:10,800
so it's going to adjust so the machine
 

6387
01:48:10,800 --> 01:48:12,390
so it's going to adjust so the machine
learning side the computer side is going

6388
01:48:12,390 --> 01:48:12,400
learning side the computer side is going
 

6389
01:48:12,400 --> 01:48:13,990
learning side the computer side is going
to adjust and then the brain is going to

6390
01:48:13,990 --> 01:48:14,000
to adjust and then the brain is going to
 

6391
01:48:14,000 --> 01:48:14,550
to adjust and then the brain is going to
adjust

6392
01:48:14,550 --> 01:48:14,560
adjust
 

6393
01:48:14,560 --> 01:48:16,310
adjust
exactly and then what what soup does

6394
01:48:16,310 --> 01:48:16,320
exactly and then what what soup does
 

6395
01:48:16,320 --> 01:48:18,310
exactly and then what what soup does
this landers

6396
01:48:18,310 --> 01:48:18,320
this landers
 

6397
01:48:18,320 --> 01:48:20,470
this landers
the kind of hallucinations you might get

6398
01:48:20,470 --> 01:48:20,480
the kind of hallucinations you might get
 

6399
01:48:20,480 --> 01:48:21,669
the kind of hallucinations you might get
from this

6400
01:48:21,669 --> 01:48:21,679
from this
 

6401
01:48:21,679 --> 01:48:24,390
from this
that might be pretty intense yeah yeah

6402
01:48:24,390 --> 01:48:24,400
that might be pretty intense yeah yeah
 

6403
01:48:24,400 --> 01:48:26,950
that might be pretty intense yeah yeah
just connecting to all of wikipedia

6404
01:48:26,950 --> 01:48:26,960
just connecting to all of wikipedia
 

6405
01:48:26,960 --> 01:48:29,350
just connecting to all of wikipedia
it's interesting whether we need to be

6406
01:48:29,350 --> 01:48:29,360
it's interesting whether we need to be
 

6407
01:48:29,360 --> 01:48:30,550
it's interesting whether we need to be
able to figure out

6408
01:48:30,550 --> 01:48:30,560
able to figure out
 

6409
01:48:30,560 --> 01:48:33,189
able to figure out
the basic protocol of the brain's

6410
01:48:33,189 --> 01:48:33,199
the basic protocol of the brain's
 

6411
01:48:33,199 --> 01:48:35,030
the basic protocol of the brain's
communication schemes

6412
01:48:35,030 --> 01:48:35,040
communication schemes
 

6413
01:48:35,040 --> 01:48:37,669
communication schemes
in order to get them to the machine and

6414
01:48:37,669 --> 01:48:37,679
in order to get them to the machine and
 

6415
01:48:37,679 --> 01:48:38,709
in order to get them to the machine and
the brain to talk

6416
01:48:38,709 --> 01:48:38,719
the brain to talk
 

6417
01:48:38,719 --> 01:48:41,189
the brain to talk
because another possibility is the brain

6418
01:48:41,189 --> 01:48:41,199
because another possibility is the brain
 

6419
01:48:41,199 --> 01:48:42,629
because another possibility is the brain
actually just adjusts to whatever the

6420
01:48:42,629 --> 01:48:42,639
actually just adjusts to whatever the
 

6421
01:48:42,639 --> 01:48:44,070
actually just adjusts to whatever the
heck the computer is doing exactly

6422
01:48:44,070 --> 01:48:44,080
heck the computer is doing exactly
 

6423
01:48:44,080 --> 01:48:44,709
heck the computer is doing exactly
that's the way

6424
01:48:44,709 --> 01:48:44,719
that's the way
 

6425
01:48:44,719 --> 01:48:47,109
that's the way
i think that i find that to be a more

6426
01:48:47,109 --> 01:48:47,119
i think that i find that to be a more
 

6427
01:48:47,119 --> 01:48:47,990
i think that i find that to be a more
promising way

6428
01:48:47,990 --> 01:48:48,000
promising way
 

6429
01:48:48,000 --> 01:48:50,709
promising way
it's basically saying you know okay

6430
01:48:50,709 --> 01:48:50,719
it's basically saying you know okay
 

6431
01:48:50,719 --> 01:48:52,229
it's basically saying you know okay
attach electrodes to some part of the

6432
01:48:52,229 --> 01:48:52,239
attach electrodes to some part of the
 

6433
01:48:52,239 --> 01:48:52,870
attach electrodes to some part of the
cortex

6434
01:48:52,870 --> 01:48:52,880
cortex
 

6435
01:48:52,880 --> 01:48:55,830
cortex
okay and make sure maybe if it is done

6436
01:48:55,830 --> 01:48:55,840
okay and make sure maybe if it is done
 

6437
01:48:55,840 --> 01:48:57,030
okay and make sure maybe if it is done
from birth

6438
01:48:57,030 --> 01:48:57,040
from birth
 

6439
01:48:57,040 --> 01:48:58,470
from birth
the brain will adapt it says that you

6440
01:48:58,470 --> 01:48:58,480
the brain will adapt it says that you
 

6441
01:48:58,480 --> 01:49:00,470
the brain will adapt it says that you
know that part is not damaged it was not

6442
01:49:00,470 --> 01:49:00,480
know that part is not damaged it was not
 

6443
01:49:00,480 --> 01:49:01,350
know that part is not damaged it was not
used for anything

6444
01:49:01,350 --> 01:49:01,360
used for anything
 

6445
01:49:01,360 --> 01:49:02,709
used for anything
these electrodes are attached there

6446
01:49:02,709 --> 01:49:02,719
these electrodes are attached there
 

6447
01:49:02,719 --> 01:49:04,550
these electrodes are attached there
right and now you

6448
01:49:04,550 --> 01:49:04,560
right and now you
 

6449
01:49:04,560 --> 01:49:07,030
right and now you
you train that part of the brain to do

6450
01:49:07,030 --> 01:49:07,040
you train that part of the brain to do
 

6451
01:49:07,040 --> 01:49:08,470
you train that part of the brain to do
this high bandwidth communication

6452
01:49:08,470 --> 01:49:08,480
this high bandwidth communication
 

6453
01:49:08,480 --> 01:49:09,109
this high bandwidth communication
between

6454
01:49:09,109 --> 01:49:09,119
between
 

6455
01:49:09,119 --> 01:49:11,669
between
something else right and and uh if you

6456
01:49:11,669 --> 01:49:11,679
something else right and and uh if you
 

6457
01:49:11,679 --> 01:49:13,109
something else right and and uh if you
do it like that

6458
01:49:13,109 --> 01:49:13,119
do it like that
 

6459
01:49:13,119 --> 01:49:15,350
do it like that
either then it is brain adapting to and

6460
01:49:15,350 --> 01:49:15,360
either then it is brain adapting to and
 

6461
01:49:15,360 --> 01:49:16,950
either then it is brain adapting to and
of course your external system is the

6462
01:49:16,950 --> 01:49:16,960
of course your external system is the
 

6463
01:49:16,960 --> 01:49:18,550
of course your external system is the
sciences that it is adaptable you know

6464
01:49:18,550 --> 01:49:18,560
sciences that it is adaptable you know
 

6465
01:49:18,560 --> 01:49:19,830
sciences that it is adaptable you know
just like we

6466
01:49:19,830 --> 01:49:19,840
just like we
 

6467
01:49:19,840 --> 01:49:21,910
just like we
you know design computers or mouse

6468
01:49:21,910 --> 01:49:21,920
you know design computers or mouse
 

6469
01:49:21,920 --> 01:49:23,430
you know design computers or mouse
keyboard all of them to be

6470
01:49:23,430 --> 01:49:23,440
keyboard all of them to be
 

6471
01:49:23,440 --> 01:49:27,589
keyboard all of them to be
uh interacting with humans so

6472
01:49:27,589 --> 01:49:27,599
uh interacting with humans so
 

6473
01:49:27,599 --> 01:49:28,870
uh interacting with humans so
of course that feedback system is

6474
01:49:28,870 --> 01:49:28,880
of course that feedback system is
 

6475
01:49:28,880 --> 01:49:30,790
of course that feedback system is
designed to be uh

6476
01:49:30,790 --> 01:49:30,800
designed to be uh
 

6477
01:49:30,800 --> 01:49:33,990
designed to be uh
human compatible but um

6478
01:49:33,990 --> 01:49:34,000
human compatible but um
 

6479
01:49:34,000 --> 01:49:36,550
human compatible but um
now it is not trying to record from the

6480
01:49:36,550 --> 01:49:36,560
now it is not trying to record from the
 

6481
01:49:36,560 --> 01:49:37,430
now it is not trying to record from the
all of the brain

6482
01:49:37,430 --> 01:49:37,440
all of the brain
 

6483
01:49:37,440 --> 01:49:40,229
all of the brain
and uh you know now you know two systems

6484
01:49:40,229 --> 01:49:40,239
and uh you know now you know two systems
 

6485
01:49:40,239 --> 01:49:41,750
and uh you know now you know two systems
trying to adapt to each other

6486
01:49:41,750 --> 01:49:41,760
trying to adapt to each other
 

6487
01:49:41,760 --> 01:49:44,229
trying to adapt to each other
it's the brain adapting into one way

6488
01:49:44,229 --> 01:49:44,239
it's the brain adapting into one way
 

6489
01:49:44,239 --> 01:49:45,510
it's the brain adapting into one way
it's passing

6490
01:49:45,510 --> 01:49:45,520
it's passing
 

6491
01:49:45,520 --> 01:49:47,430
it's passing
the brain is connected to like the

6492
01:49:47,430 --> 01:49:47,440
the brain is connected to like the
 

6493
01:49:47,440 --> 01:49:49,109
the brain is connected to like the
internet it's connected

6494
01:49:49,109 --> 01:49:49,119
internet it's connected
 

6495
01:49:49,119 --> 01:49:51,750
internet it's connected
yeah just imagine just connecting it to

6496
01:49:51,750 --> 01:49:51,760
yeah just imagine just connecting it to
 

6497
01:49:51,760 --> 01:49:53,750
yeah just imagine just connecting it to
twitter and just just just taking that

6498
01:49:53,750 --> 01:49:53,760
twitter and just just just taking that
 

6499
01:49:53,760 --> 01:49:55,189
twitter and just just just taking that
stream

6500
01:49:55,189 --> 01:49:55,199
stream
 

6501
01:49:55,199 --> 01:49:58,629
stream
of information um yeah

6502
01:49:58,629 --> 01:49:58,639
of information um yeah
 

6503
01:49:58,639 --> 01:50:00,709
of information um yeah
but again if we take a step back i don't

6504
01:50:00,709 --> 01:50:00,719
but again if we take a step back i don't
 

6505
01:50:00,719 --> 01:50:02,390
but again if we take a step back i don't
know what your intuition is

6506
01:50:02,390 --> 01:50:02,400
know what your intuition is
 

6507
01:50:02,400 --> 01:50:05,589
know what your intuition is
i feel like that is not as hard

6508
01:50:05,589 --> 01:50:05,599
i feel like that is not as hard
 

6509
01:50:05,599 --> 01:50:08,790
i feel like that is not as hard
of a problem as the

6510
01:50:08,790 --> 01:50:08,800
of a problem as the
 

6511
01:50:08,800 --> 01:50:12,470
of a problem as the
doing it safely there's there's a huge

6512
01:50:12,470 --> 01:50:12,480
doing it safely there's there's a huge
 

6513
01:50:12,480 --> 01:50:15,510
doing it safely there's there's a huge
barrier to surgery right

6514
01:50:15,510 --> 01:50:15,520
barrier to surgery right
 

6515
01:50:15,520 --> 01:50:17,589
barrier to surgery right
because because the biological system

6516
01:50:17,589 --> 01:50:17,599
because because the biological system
 

6517
01:50:17,599 --> 01:50:18,950
because because the biological system
it's it's a mush

6518
01:50:18,950 --> 01:50:18,960
it's it's a mush
 

6519
01:50:18,960 --> 01:50:22,149
it's it's a mush
of like weird stuff correct so

6520
01:50:22,149 --> 01:50:22,159
of like weird stuff correct so
 

6521
01:50:22,159 --> 01:50:24,390
of like weird stuff correct so
that the surgery part of it biology part

6522
01:50:24,390 --> 01:50:24,400
that the surgery part of it biology part
 

6523
01:50:24,400 --> 01:50:26,070
that the surgery part of it biology part
of it the the long term

6524
01:50:26,070 --> 01:50:26,080
of it the the long term
 

6525
01:50:26,080 --> 01:50:28,390
of it the the long term
repercussions part of it again i don't

6526
01:50:28,390 --> 01:50:28,400
repercussions part of it again i don't
 

6527
01:50:28,400 --> 01:50:29,910
repercussions part of it again i don't
know what else will

6528
01:50:29,910 --> 01:50:29,920
know what else will
 

6529
01:50:29,920 --> 01:50:32,870
know what else will
uh you know we we often find uh after a

6530
01:50:32,870 --> 01:50:32,880
uh you know we we often find uh after a
 

6531
01:50:32,880 --> 01:50:33,830
uh you know we we often find uh after a
long time

6532
01:50:33,830 --> 01:50:33,840
long time
 

6533
01:50:33,840 --> 01:50:36,629
long time
uh in biology that okay that idea was

6534
01:50:36,629 --> 01:50:36,639
uh in biology that okay that idea was
 

6535
01:50:36,639 --> 01:50:38,149
uh in biology that okay that idea was
wrong right you know so

6536
01:50:38,149 --> 01:50:38,159
wrong right you know so
 

6537
01:50:38,159 --> 01:50:41,270
wrong right you know so
people used to cut off this

6538
01:50:41,270 --> 01:50:41,280
people used to cut off this
 

6539
01:50:41,280 --> 01:50:43,750
people used to cut off this
the gland called the thymus or something

6540
01:50:43,750 --> 01:50:43,760
the gland called the thymus or something
 

6541
01:50:43,760 --> 01:50:44,870
the gland called the thymus or something
and

6542
01:50:44,870 --> 01:50:44,880
and
 

6543
01:50:44,880 --> 01:50:46,790
and
then they found that oh no that actually

6544
01:50:46,790 --> 01:50:46,800
then they found that oh no that actually
 

6545
01:50:46,800 --> 01:50:50,629
then they found that oh no that actually
causes cancer

6546
01:50:50,629 --> 01:50:50,639

 

6547
01:50:50,639 --> 01:50:52,790

and then there's a subtle like millions

6548
01:50:52,790 --> 01:50:52,800
and then there's a subtle like millions
 

6549
01:50:52,800 --> 01:50:54,070
and then there's a subtle like millions
of variables involved

6550
01:50:54,070 --> 01:50:54,080
of variables involved
 

6551
01:50:54,080 --> 01:50:57,510
of variables involved
but this whole process the nice thing

6552
01:50:57,510 --> 01:50:57,520
but this whole process the nice thing
 

6553
01:50:57,520 --> 01:50:59,750
but this whole process the nice thing
and just like again with elon just like

6554
01:50:59,750 --> 01:50:59,760
and just like again with elon just like
 

6555
01:50:59,760 --> 01:51:00,870
and just like again with elon just like
colonizing mars

6556
01:51:00,870 --> 01:51:00,880
colonizing mars
 

6557
01:51:00,880 --> 01:51:03,510
colonizing mars
seems like a ridiculously difficult idea

6558
01:51:03,510 --> 01:51:03,520
seems like a ridiculously difficult idea
 

6559
01:51:03,520 --> 01:51:04,149
seems like a ridiculously difficult idea
but

6560
01:51:04,149 --> 01:51:04,159
but
 

6561
01:51:04,159 --> 01:51:05,669
but
in the process of doing it we might

6562
01:51:05,669 --> 01:51:05,679
in the process of doing it we might
 

6563
01:51:05,679 --> 01:51:08,390
in the process of doing it we might
learn a lot about the biology of the

6564
01:51:08,390 --> 01:51:08,400
learn a lot about the biology of the
 

6565
01:51:08,400 --> 01:51:10,229
learn a lot about the biology of the
neurobiology of the brain

6566
01:51:10,229 --> 01:51:10,239
neurobiology of the brain
 

6567
01:51:10,239 --> 01:51:11,990
neurobiology of the brain
the neuroscience side of things it's

6568
01:51:11,990 --> 01:51:12,000
the neuroscience side of things it's
 

6569
01:51:12,000 --> 01:51:14,310
the neuroscience side of things it's
like if you want to learn something

6570
01:51:14,310 --> 01:51:14,320
like if you want to learn something
 

6571
01:51:14,320 --> 01:51:17,030
like if you want to learn something
do the most difficult version of it yeah

6572
01:51:17,030 --> 01:51:17,040
do the most difficult version of it yeah
 

6573
01:51:17,040 --> 01:51:18,470
do the most difficult version of it yeah
and see what you learn

6574
01:51:18,470 --> 01:51:18,480
and see what you learn
 

6575
01:51:18,480 --> 01:51:19,910
and see what you learn
the intermediate steps that they are

6576
01:51:19,910 --> 01:51:19,920
the intermediate steps that they are
 

6577
01:51:19,920 --> 01:51:22,470
the intermediate steps that they are
taking sounded all very reasonable to me

6578
01:51:22,470 --> 01:51:22,480
taking sounded all very reasonable to me
 

6579
01:51:22,480 --> 01:51:25,270
taking sounded all very reasonable to me
yeah yeah it's great well but like

6580
01:51:25,270 --> 01:51:25,280
yeah yeah it's great well but like
 

6581
01:51:25,280 --> 01:51:26,950
yeah yeah it's great well but like
everything with elon is the timeline

6582
01:51:26,950 --> 01:51:26,960
everything with elon is the timeline
 

6583
01:51:26,960 --> 01:51:27,350
everything with elon is the timeline
seems

6584
01:51:27,350 --> 01:51:27,360
seems
 

6585
01:51:27,360 --> 01:51:30,550
seems
insanely fast so that's that's the only

6586
01:51:30,550 --> 01:51:30,560
insanely fast so that's that's the only
 

6587
01:51:30,560 --> 01:51:31,910
insanely fast so that's that's the only
awful question

6588
01:51:31,910 --> 01:51:31,920
awful question
 

6589
01:51:31,920 --> 01:51:34,870
awful question
uh well one we've been talking about

6590
01:51:34,870 --> 01:51:34,880
uh well one we've been talking about
 

6591
01:51:34,880 --> 01:51:35,669
uh well one we've been talking about
cognition

6592
01:51:35,669 --> 01:51:35,679
cognition
 

6593
01:51:35,679 --> 01:51:38,709
cognition
a little bit so like reasoning

6594
01:51:38,709 --> 01:51:38,719
a little bit so like reasoning
 

6595
01:51:38,719 --> 01:51:40,310
a little bit so like reasoning
we haven't mentioned the other c word

6596
01:51:40,310 --> 01:51:40,320
we haven't mentioned the other c word
 

6597
01:51:40,320 --> 01:51:41,990
we haven't mentioned the other c word
which is consciousness

6598
01:51:41,990 --> 01:51:42,000
which is consciousness
 

6599
01:51:42,000 --> 01:51:43,910
which is consciousness
uh do you ever think about that one do

6600
01:51:43,910 --> 01:51:43,920
uh do you ever think about that one do
 

6601
01:51:43,920 --> 01:51:45,189
uh do you ever think about that one do
is that useful at all

6602
01:51:45,189 --> 01:51:45,199
is that useful at all
 

6603
01:51:45,199 --> 01:51:48,229
is that useful at all
uh in this whole context of

6604
01:51:48,229 --> 01:51:48,239
uh in this whole context of
 

6605
01:51:48,239 --> 01:51:50,950
uh in this whole context of
what it takes to create an intelligent

6606
01:51:50,950 --> 01:51:50,960
what it takes to create an intelligent
 

6607
01:51:50,960 --> 01:51:52,229
what it takes to create an intelligent
reasoning being

6608
01:51:52,229 --> 01:51:52,239
reasoning being
 

6609
01:51:52,239 --> 01:51:55,350
reasoning being
or is that completely outside of uh your

6610
01:51:55,350 --> 01:51:55,360
or is that completely outside of uh your
 

6611
01:51:55,360 --> 01:51:55,669
or is that completely outside of uh your
uh

6612
01:51:55,669 --> 01:51:55,679
uh
 

6613
01:51:55,679 --> 01:51:58,629
uh
like the engineering perspective uh it

6614
01:51:58,629 --> 01:51:58,639
like the engineering perspective uh it
 

6615
01:51:58,639 --> 01:52:01,189
like the engineering perspective uh it
is not outside the realm but it doesn't

6616
01:52:01,189 --> 01:52:01,199
is not outside the realm but it doesn't
 

6617
01:52:01,199 --> 01:52:04,229
is not outside the realm but it doesn't
on a day-to-day way uh you know basis

6618
01:52:04,229 --> 01:52:04,239
on a day-to-day way uh you know basis
 

6619
01:52:04,239 --> 01:52:07,189
on a day-to-day way uh you know basis
inform what we do but it's more so in in

6620
01:52:07,189 --> 01:52:07,199
inform what we do but it's more so in in
 

6621
01:52:07,199 --> 01:52:08,070
inform what we do but it's more so in in
many ways

6622
01:52:08,070 --> 01:52:08,080
many ways
 

6623
01:52:08,080 --> 01:52:11,270
many ways
the company name is connected to this uh

6624
01:52:11,270 --> 01:52:11,280
the company name is connected to this uh
 

6625
01:52:11,280 --> 01:52:12,470
the company name is connected to this uh
idea of consciousness

6626
01:52:12,470 --> 01:52:12,480
idea of consciousness
 

6627
01:52:12,480 --> 01:52:14,390
idea of consciousness
what's what's the company name vicarious

6628
01:52:14,390 --> 01:52:14,400
what's what's the company name vicarious
 

6629
01:52:14,400 --> 01:52:16,629
what's what's the company name vicarious
you know so vacation is the company name

6630
01:52:16,629 --> 01:52:16,639
you know so vacation is the company name
 

6631
01:52:16,639 --> 01:52:19,910
you know so vacation is the company name
and uh and so what does victorious mean

6632
01:52:19,910 --> 01:52:19,920
and uh and so what does victorious mean
 

6633
01:52:19,920 --> 01:52:20,629
and uh and so what does victorious mean
right it's

6634
01:52:20,629 --> 01:52:20,639
right it's
 

6635
01:52:20,639 --> 01:52:23,990
right it's
um uh at the first level it is about

6636
01:52:23,990 --> 01:52:24,000
um uh at the first level it is about
 

6637
01:52:24,000 --> 01:52:25,030
um uh at the first level it is about
modeling the world

6638
01:52:25,030 --> 01:52:25,040
modeling the world
 

6639
01:52:25,040 --> 01:52:28,310
modeling the world
and uh and it is internalizing the

6640
01:52:28,310 --> 01:52:28,320
and uh and it is internalizing the
 

6641
01:52:28,320 --> 01:52:29,430
and uh and it is internalizing the
external actions

6642
01:52:29,430 --> 01:52:29,440
external actions
 

6643
01:52:29,440 --> 01:52:31,510
external actions
so so you interact with the world and

6644
01:52:31,510 --> 01:52:31,520
so so you interact with the world and
 

6645
01:52:31,520 --> 01:52:32,950
so so you interact with the world and
learn a lot about the world

6646
01:52:32,950 --> 01:52:32,960
learn a lot about the world
 

6647
01:52:32,960 --> 01:52:35,430
learn a lot about the world
and now after having learned a lot about

6648
01:52:35,430 --> 01:52:35,440
and now after having learned a lot about
 

6649
01:52:35,440 --> 01:52:36,390
and now after having learned a lot about
the world

6650
01:52:36,390 --> 01:52:36,400
the world
 

6651
01:52:36,400 --> 01:52:39,990
the world
you can run those things in your mind

6652
01:52:39,990 --> 01:52:40,000
you can run those things in your mind
 

6653
01:52:40,000 --> 01:52:41,510
you can run those things in your mind
without actually having to

6654
01:52:41,510 --> 01:52:41,520
without actually having to
 

6655
01:52:41,520 --> 01:52:44,229
without actually having to
uh act in the world so you can run uh

6656
01:52:44,229 --> 01:52:44,239
uh act in the world so you can run uh
 

6657
01:52:44,239 --> 01:52:45,990
uh act in the world so you can run uh
things vicariously just in your

6658
01:52:45,990 --> 01:52:46,000
things vicariously just in your
 

6659
01:52:46,000 --> 01:52:48,229
things vicariously just in your
in your in your brain and similarly you

6660
01:52:48,229 --> 01:52:48,239
in your in your brain and similarly you
 

6661
01:52:48,239 --> 01:52:49,589
in your in your brain and similarly you
can experience

6662
01:52:49,589 --> 01:52:49,599
can experience
 

6663
01:52:49,599 --> 01:52:52,229
can experience
another person's thoughts by you know

6664
01:52:52,229 --> 01:52:52,239
another person's thoughts by you know
 

6665
01:52:52,239 --> 01:52:54,629
another person's thoughts by you know
having a model of how that person works

6666
01:52:54,629 --> 01:52:54,639
having a model of how that person works
 

6667
01:52:54,639 --> 01:52:57,109
having a model of how that person works
and uh and running their you know

6668
01:52:57,109 --> 01:52:57,119
and uh and running their you know
 

6669
01:52:57,119 --> 01:52:59,109
and uh and running their you know
putting yourself in some other person's

6670
01:52:59,109 --> 01:52:59,119
putting yourself in some other person's
 

6671
01:52:59,119 --> 01:53:02,310
putting yourself in some other person's
shoes so that is being vicarious now

6672
01:53:02,310 --> 01:53:02,320
shoes so that is being vicarious now
 

6673
01:53:02,320 --> 01:53:04,629
shoes so that is being vicarious now
it's the same modeling apparatus that

6674
01:53:04,629 --> 01:53:04,639
it's the same modeling apparatus that
 

6675
01:53:04,639 --> 01:53:06,870
it's the same modeling apparatus that
you're using to model the external world

6676
01:53:06,870 --> 01:53:06,880
you're using to model the external world
 

6677
01:53:06,880 --> 01:53:09,990
you're using to model the external world
or some other person's thoughts you can

6678
01:53:09,990 --> 01:53:10,000
or some other person's thoughts you can
 

6679
01:53:10,000 --> 01:53:12,390
or some other person's thoughts you can
turn it to yourself you can up you know

6680
01:53:12,390 --> 01:53:12,400
turn it to yourself you can up you know
 

6681
01:53:12,400 --> 01:53:14,390
turn it to yourself you can up you know
if that same modeling thing is

6682
01:53:14,390 --> 01:53:14,400
if that same modeling thing is
 

6683
01:53:14,400 --> 01:53:17,589
if that same modeling thing is
applied to your own modeling apparatus

6684
01:53:17,589 --> 01:53:17,599
applied to your own modeling apparatus
 

6685
01:53:17,599 --> 01:53:19,830
applied to your own modeling apparatus
then that is what gives rise to

6686
01:53:19,830 --> 01:53:19,840
then that is what gives rise to
 

6687
01:53:19,840 --> 01:53:21,030
then that is what gives rise to
consciousness i think

6688
01:53:21,030 --> 01:53:21,040
consciousness i think
 

6689
01:53:21,040 --> 01:53:23,589
consciousness i think
well that's more like self-awareness

6690
01:53:23,589 --> 01:53:23,599
well that's more like self-awareness
 

6691
01:53:23,599 --> 01:53:24,790
well that's more like self-awareness
there's the heart problem of

6692
01:53:24,790 --> 01:53:24,800
there's the heart problem of
 

6693
01:53:24,800 --> 01:53:27,350
there's the heart problem of
consciousness which is

6694
01:53:27,350 --> 01:53:27,360
consciousness which is
 

6695
01:53:27,360 --> 01:53:30,550
consciousness which is
like when the model becomes when

6696
01:53:30,550 --> 01:53:30,560
like when the model becomes when
 

6697
01:53:30,560 --> 01:53:32,870
like when the model becomes when
when the model feels like something when

6698
01:53:32,870 --> 01:53:32,880
when the model feels like something when
 

6699
01:53:32,880 --> 01:53:34,950
when the model feels like something when
this whole process is like

6700
01:53:34,950 --> 01:53:34,960
this whole process is like
 

6701
01:53:34,960 --> 01:53:38,229
this whole process is like
it act it's like you really are

6702
01:53:38,229 --> 01:53:38,239
it act it's like you really are
 

6703
01:53:38,239 --> 01:53:40,870
it act it's like you really are
in it you feel like an entity in this

6704
01:53:40,870 --> 01:53:40,880
in it you feel like an entity in this
 

6705
01:53:40,880 --> 01:53:41,830
in it you feel like an entity in this
world

6706
01:53:41,830 --> 01:53:41,840
world
 

6707
01:53:41,840 --> 01:53:43,990
world
not just you know that you're an entity

6708
01:53:43,990 --> 01:53:44,000
not just you know that you're an entity
 

6709
01:53:44,000 --> 01:53:46,149
not just you know that you're an entity
but it feels like something to be that

6710
01:53:46,149 --> 01:53:46,159
but it feels like something to be that
 

6711
01:53:46,159 --> 01:53:47,109
but it feels like something to be that
entity

6712
01:53:47,109 --> 01:53:47,119
entity
 

6713
01:53:47,119 --> 01:53:50,709
entity
it um it you know

6714
01:53:50,709 --> 01:53:50,719
it um it you know
 

6715
01:53:50,719 --> 01:53:54,390
it um it you know
and thereby we attribute this you know

6716
01:53:54,390 --> 01:53:54,400
and thereby we attribute this you know
 

6717
01:53:54,400 --> 01:53:56,149
and thereby we attribute this you know
then it starts to be wherein something

6718
01:53:56,149 --> 01:53:56,159
then it starts to be wherein something
 

6719
01:53:56,159 --> 01:53:58,310
then it starts to be wherein something
that has consciousness can suffer

6720
01:53:58,310 --> 01:53:58,320
that has consciousness can suffer
 

6721
01:53:58,320 --> 01:54:00,070
that has consciousness can suffer
you start to have these kinds of things

6722
01:54:00,070 --> 01:54:00,080
you start to have these kinds of things
 

6723
01:54:00,080 --> 01:54:02,229
you start to have these kinds of things
that we can reason about that

6724
01:54:02,229 --> 01:54:02,239
that we can reason about that
 

6725
01:54:02,239 --> 01:54:05,270
that we can reason about that
yes much

6726
01:54:05,270 --> 01:54:05,280

 

6727
01:54:05,280 --> 01:54:07,669

much heavier it seems like there's much

6728
01:54:07,669 --> 01:54:07,679
much heavier it seems like there's much
 

6729
01:54:07,679 --> 01:54:09,270
much heavier it seems like there's much
greater cost of your

6730
01:54:09,270 --> 01:54:09,280
greater cost of your
 

6731
01:54:09,280 --> 01:54:12,470
greater cost of your
your decisions and like mortality

6732
01:54:12,470 --> 01:54:12,480
your decisions and like mortality
 

6733
01:54:12,480 --> 01:54:15,030
your decisions and like mortality
is tied up into that like the fact that

6734
01:54:15,030 --> 01:54:15,040
is tied up into that like the fact that
 

6735
01:54:15,040 --> 01:54:15,830
is tied up into that like the fact that
these things

6736
01:54:15,830 --> 01:54:15,840
these things
 

6737
01:54:15,840 --> 01:54:19,109
these things
end right first of all i

6738
01:54:19,109 --> 01:54:19,119
end right first of all i
 

6739
01:54:19,119 --> 01:54:21,350
end right first of all i
end at some point and then other things

6740
01:54:21,350 --> 01:54:21,360
end at some point and then other things
 

6741
01:54:21,360 --> 01:54:22,390
end at some point and then other things
end

6742
01:54:22,390 --> 01:54:22,400
end
 

6743
01:54:22,400 --> 01:54:25,270
end
and you know that that somehow seems to

6744
01:54:25,270 --> 01:54:25,280
and you know that that somehow seems to
 

6745
01:54:25,280 --> 01:54:26,709
and you know that that somehow seems to
be

6746
01:54:26,709 --> 01:54:26,719
be
 

6747
01:54:26,719 --> 01:54:30,229
be
at least for us humans a deep motivator

6748
01:54:30,229 --> 01:54:30,239
at least for us humans a deep motivator
 

6749
01:54:30,239 --> 01:54:33,189
at least for us humans a deep motivator
yes and that you know that that idea of

6750
01:54:33,189 --> 01:54:33,199
yes and that you know that that idea of
 

6751
01:54:33,199 --> 01:54:34,790
yes and that you know that that idea of
motivation in general we talk about

6752
01:54:34,790 --> 01:54:34,800
motivation in general we talk about
 

6753
01:54:34,800 --> 01:54:37,669
motivation in general we talk about
goals and ai but right

6754
01:54:37,669 --> 01:54:37,679
goals and ai but right
 

6755
01:54:37,679 --> 01:54:40,390
goals and ai but right
the goals aren't quite the same thing as

6756
01:54:40,390 --> 01:54:40,400
the goals aren't quite the same thing as
 

6757
01:54:40,400 --> 01:54:40,790
the goals aren't quite the same thing as
like

6758
01:54:40,790 --> 01:54:40,800
like
 

6759
01:54:40,800 --> 01:54:44,390
like
the our mortality it feels like

6760
01:54:44,390 --> 01:54:44,400
the our mortality it feels like
 

6761
01:54:44,400 --> 01:54:45,990
the our mortality it feels like
it feels like first of all humans don't

6762
01:54:45,990 --> 01:54:46,000
it feels like first of all humans don't
 

6763
01:54:46,000 --> 01:54:47,430
it feels like first of all humans don't
have a goal

6764
01:54:47,430 --> 01:54:47,440
have a goal
 

6765
01:54:47,440 --> 01:54:49,510
have a goal
and they just kind of create goals at

6766
01:54:49,510 --> 01:54:49,520
and they just kind of create goals at
 

6767
01:54:49,520 --> 01:54:51,109
and they just kind of create goals at
different levels they like

6768
01:54:51,109 --> 01:54:51,119
different levels they like
 

6769
01:54:51,119 --> 01:54:54,310
different levels they like
make up goals because we're

6770
01:54:54,310 --> 01:54:54,320
make up goals because we're
 

6771
01:54:54,320 --> 01:54:56,629
make up goals because we're
terrified by the mystery of the thing

6772
01:54:56,629 --> 01:54:56,639
terrified by the mystery of the thing
 

6773
01:54:56,639 --> 01:54:57,510
terrified by the mystery of the thing
that

6774
01:54:57,510 --> 01:54:57,520
that
 

6775
01:54:57,520 --> 01:55:00,550
that
that gets us all so we we

6776
01:55:00,550 --> 01:55:00,560
that gets us all so we we
 

6777
01:55:00,560 --> 01:55:03,350
that gets us all so we we
make these goals up so we're like a go

6778
01:55:03,350 --> 01:55:03,360
make these goals up so we're like a go
 

6779
01:55:03,360 --> 01:55:04,070
make these goals up so we're like a go
generation

6780
01:55:04,070 --> 01:55:04,080

machine as opposed to a machine which

6782
01:55:07,030 --> 01:55:07,040
machine as opposed to a machine which
 

6783
01:55:07,040 --> 01:55:09,109
machine as opposed to a machine which
optimizes the trajectory towards a

6784
01:55:09,109 --> 01:55:09,119
optimizes the trajectory towards a
 

6785
01:55:09,119 --> 01:55:10,790
optimizes the trajectory towards a
singular goal

6786
01:55:10,790 --> 01:55:10,800
singular goal
 

6787
01:55:10,800 --> 01:55:13,030
singular goal
so it feels like that's an important

6788
01:55:13,030 --> 01:55:13,040
so it feels like that's an important
 

6789
01:55:13,040 --> 01:55:14,390
so it feels like that's an important
part of

6790
01:55:14,390 --> 01:55:14,400
part of
 

6791
01:55:14,400 --> 01:55:17,350
part of
uh cognition that whole mortality thing

01:55:17,350 --> 01:55:17,360
uh cognition that whole mortality thing
 

6793
01:55:17,360 --> 01:55:17,990
uh cognition that whole mortality thing
well it is

6794
01:55:17,990 --> 01:55:18,000
well it is
 

6795
01:55:18,000 --> 01:55:21,109
well it is
it is a part of human uh cognition

6796
01:55:21,109 --> 01:55:21,119
it is a part of human uh cognition
 

6797
01:55:21,119 --> 01:55:24,149
it is a part of human uh cognition
uh but there is no uh reason

6798
01:55:24,149 --> 01:55:24,159
uh but there is no uh reason
 

6799
01:55:24,159 --> 01:55:27,189
uh but there is no uh reason
for uh that mortality to

6800
01:55:27,189 --> 01:55:27,199
for uh that mortality to
 

6801
01:55:27,199 --> 01:55:30,629
for uh that mortality to
come to the equation for a uh

6802
01:55:30,629 --> 01:55:30,639
come to the equation for a uh
 

6803
01:55:30,639 --> 01:55:34,070
come to the equation for a uh
artificial system because we can uh copy

the problem with humans is that we cut i

6808
01:55:37,350 --> 01:55:37,360
the problem with humans is that we cut i
 

6809
01:55:37,360 --> 01:55:38,950
the problem with humans is that we cut i
can't clone you i can't

6810
01:55:38,950 --> 01:55:38,960
can't clone you i can't
 

6811
01:55:38,960 --> 01:55:40,950
can't clone you i can't
like you know i can i can close even if

6812
01:55:40,950 --> 01:55:40,960
like you know i can i can close even if
 

6813
01:55:40,960 --> 01:55:42,470
like you know i can i can close even if
i clone usb

i clone usb
uh you know the hardware your experience

6816
01:55:45,350 --> 01:55:45,360
uh you know the hardware your experience
 

6817
01:55:45,360 --> 01:55:47,270
uh you know the hardware your experience
uh that was stored in your brain

6818

01:55:47,280 --> 01:55:49,990
uh that was stored in your brain
uh your uh episodic memory all those

uh your uh episodic memory all those
 

6821
01:55:50,000 --> 01:55:51,510
uh your uh episodic memory all those
will not be captured in the in the new

01:55:52,080 --> 01:55:55,189
clone
um so um but that's not the same with an

6826
01:55:55,189 --> 01:55:55,199
um so um but that's not the same with an
 

6827
01:55:55,199 --> 01:55:55,990
um so um but that's not the same with an
ai system

6828
01:55:55,990 --> 01:55:56,000
ai system
 

6829
01:55:56,000 --> 01:55:59,109
ai system
right so but it's also possible

6830
01:55:59,109 --> 01:55:59,119
right so but it's also possible
 

6831
01:55:59,119 --> 01:56:02,070
right so but it's also possible
that the the thing that you mentioned

6832
01:56:02,070 --> 01:56:02,080
that the the thing that you mentioned
 

6833
01:56:02,080 --> 01:56:03,750
that the the thing that you mentioned
with that with us humans

6834
01:56:03,750 --> 01:56:03,760
with that with us humans
 

6835
01:56:03,760 --> 01:56:05,510
with that with us humans
is actually fundament of fundamental

6836
01:56:05,510 --> 01:56:05,520
is actually fundament of fundamental
 

6837
01:56:05,520 --> 01:56:07,430
is actually fundament of fundamental
importance for intelligence so like

6838
01:56:07,430 --> 01:56:07,440
importance for intelligence so like
 

6839
01:56:07,440 --> 01:56:09,750
importance for intelligence so like
the fact that you can copy an ass system

6840
01:56:09,750 --> 01:56:09,760
the fact that you can copy an ass system
 

6841
01:56:09,760 --> 01:56:10,470
the fact that you can copy an ass system
yeah

6842
01:56:10,470 --> 01:56:10,480
yeah
 

6843
01:56:10,480 --> 01:56:12,790
yeah
means that that ai system is not yet an

6844
01:56:12,790 --> 01:56:12,800
means that that ai system is not yet an
 

6845
01:56:12,800 --> 01:56:13,510
means that that ai system is not yet an
um

6846
01:56:13,510 --> 01:56:13,520
um
 

6847
01:56:13,520 --> 01:56:16,550
um
agi so like there it could so if you

6848
01:56:16,550 --> 01:56:16,560
agi so like there it could so if you
 

6849
01:56:16,560 --> 01:56:17,830
agi so like there it could so if you
look at existence proof

6850
01:56:17,830 --> 01:56:17,840
look at existence proof
 

6851
01:56:17,840 --> 01:56:20,310
look at existence proof
yeah if we reason yeah based on

6852
01:56:20,310 --> 01:56:20,320
yeah if we reason yeah based on
 

6853
01:56:20,320 --> 01:56:21,750
yeah if we reason yeah based on
existence proof would

6854
01:56:21,750 --> 01:56:21,760
existence proof would
 

6855
01:56:21,760 --> 01:56:23,589
existence proof would
you could say that it doesn't feel like

6856
01:56:23,589 --> 01:56:23,599
you could say that it doesn't feel like
 

6857
01:56:23,599 --> 01:56:25,669
you could say that it doesn't feel like
death is a fundamental property of an

6858
01:56:25,669 --> 01:56:25,679
death is a fundamental property of an
 

6859
01:56:25,679 --> 01:56:27,270
death is a fundamental property of an
intelligence system

6860
01:56:27,270 --> 01:56:27,280
intelligence system
 

6861
01:56:27,280 --> 01:56:30,390
intelligence system
but we don't yet

6862
01:56:30,390 --> 01:56:30,400
but we don't yet
 

6863
01:56:30,400 --> 01:56:32,950
but we don't yet
give me an example of an immortal

6864
01:56:32,950 --> 01:56:32,960
give me an example of an immortal

01:56:33,760 --> 01:56:36,709
intelligent
being we don't have those it could it's

6868
01:56:36,709 --> 01:56:36,719
being we don't have those it could it's
 

6869
01:56:36,719 --> 01:56:37,910
being we don't have those it could it's
very possible that

6870
01:56:37,910 --> 01:56:37,920
very possible that
 

6871
01:56:37,920 --> 01:56:41,589
very possible that
you know that's that is a fundamental

6872
01:56:41,589 --> 01:56:41,599
you know that's that is a fundamental
 

6873
01:56:41,599 --> 01:56:42,470
you know that's that is a fundamental
property

6874
01:56:42,470 --> 01:56:42,480
property
 

6875
01:56:42,480 --> 01:56:45,589
property
of intelligence is a thing that

6876
01:56:45,589 --> 01:56:45,599
of intelligence is a thing that
 

6877
01:56:45,599 --> 01:56:48,709
of intelligence is a thing that
has a deadline for itself so you can

6878
01:56:48,709 --> 01:56:48,719
has a deadline for itself so you can
 

6879
01:56:48,719 --> 01:56:50,709
has a deadline for itself so you can
think of it like this so suppose you

6880
01:56:50,709 --> 01:56:50,719
think of it like this so suppose you
 

6881
01:56:50,719 --> 01:56:53,669
think of it like this so suppose you
invent a way to freeze people uh for a

6882
01:56:53,669 --> 01:56:53,679
invent a way to freeze people uh for a
 

6883
01:56:53,679 --> 01:56:54,390
invent a way to freeze people uh for a
long time

6884
01:56:54,390 --> 01:56:54,400
long time
 

6885
01:56:54,400 --> 01:56:57,350
long time
it's not dying right yeah uh so so you

6886
01:56:57,350 --> 01:56:57,360
it's not dying right yeah uh so so you
 

6887
01:56:57,360 --> 01:56:59,270
it's not dying right yeah uh so so you
can be frozen and woken up

6888
01:56:59,270 --> 01:56:59,280
can be frozen and woken up
 

6889
01:56:59,280 --> 01:57:01,990
can be frozen and woken up
uh thousands of years from now uh so

6890
01:57:01,990 --> 01:57:02,000
uh thousands of years from now uh so
 

6891
01:57:02,000 --> 01:57:03,589
uh thousands of years from now uh so
it's no fear of death

6892
01:57:03,589 --> 01:57:03,599
it's no fear of death
 

6893
01:57:03,599 --> 01:57:06,709
it's no fear of death
so well no the you're still

6894
01:57:06,709 --> 01:57:06,719
so well no the you're still
 

6895
01:57:06,719 --> 01:57:09,030
so well no the you're still
it's it's not it's not about time it's

6896
01:57:09,030 --> 01:57:09,040
it's it's not it's not about time it's
 

6897
01:57:09,040 --> 01:57:10,709
it's it's not it's not about time it's
about the knowledge that it's

6898
01:57:10,709 --> 01:57:10,719
about the knowledge that it's
 

6899
01:57:10,719 --> 01:57:14,310
about the knowledge that it's
temporary and the

6900
01:57:14,310 --> 01:57:14,320
temporary and the
 

6901
01:57:14,320 --> 01:57:17,669
temporary and the
that aspect of it the finiteness of it

6902
01:57:17,669 --> 01:57:17,679
that aspect of it the finiteness of it
 

6903
01:57:17,679 --> 01:57:21,589
that aspect of it the finiteness of it
i think um creates a kind of urgency

6904
01:57:21,589 --> 01:57:21,599
i think um creates a kind of urgency
 

6905
01:57:21,599 --> 01:57:23,830
i think um creates a kind of urgency
correct for us for humans yeah for

6906
01:57:23,830 --> 01:57:23,840
correct for us for humans yeah for
 

6907
01:57:23,840 --> 01:57:24,629
correct for us for humans yeah for
humans yes

6908
01:57:24,629 --> 01:57:24,639
humans yes
 

6909
01:57:24,639 --> 01:57:27,189
humans yes
uh and that that is part of our drives

6910
01:57:27,189 --> 01:57:27,199
uh and that that is part of our drives
 

6911
01:57:27,199 --> 01:57:27,990
uh and that that is part of our drives
uh

6912
01:57:27,990 --> 01:57:28,000
uh
 

6913
01:57:28,000 --> 01:57:30,709
uh
but um and that's why i'm not too

6914
01:57:30,709 --> 01:57:30,719
but um and that's why i'm not too
 

6915
01:57:30,719 --> 01:57:32,229
but um and that's why i'm not too
worried about

6916
01:57:32,229 --> 01:57:32,239
worried about
 

6917
01:57:32,239 --> 01:57:35,669
worried about
ai uh you know uh

6918
01:57:35,669 --> 01:57:35,679
ai uh you know uh
 

6919
01:57:35,679 --> 01:57:37,910
ai uh you know uh
having motivations to kill all humans

6920
01:57:37,910 --> 01:57:37,920
having motivations to kill all humans
 

6921
01:57:37,920 --> 01:57:39,910
having motivations to kill all humans
and uh those kinds of things why just

6922
01:57:39,910 --> 01:57:39,920
and uh those kinds of things why just
 

6923
01:57:39,920 --> 01:57:40,310
and uh those kinds of things why just
wait

6924
01:57:40,310 --> 01:57:40,320
wait
 

6925
01:57:40,320 --> 01:57:44,229
wait
you know so so

6926
01:57:44,229 --> 01:57:44,239
you know so so
 

6927
01:57:44,239 --> 01:57:45,669
you know so so
why do you need to do that yeah i've

6928
01:57:45,669 --> 01:57:45,679
why do you need to do that yeah i've
 

6929
01:57:45,679 --> 01:57:47,350
why do you need to do that yeah i've
never heard that before that's a good

6930
01:57:47,350 --> 01:57:47,360
never heard that before that's a good
 

6931
01:57:47,360 --> 01:57:50,470
never heard that before that's a good
it's a good point because

6932
01:57:50,470 --> 01:57:50,480
it's a good point because
 

6933
01:57:50,480 --> 01:57:52,229
it's a good point because
yeah just murder seems like a lot of

6934
01:57:52,229 --> 01:57:52,239
yeah just murder seems like a lot of
 

6935
01:57:52,239 --> 01:57:53,510
yeah just murder seems like a lot of
work we'll just wait

6936
01:57:53,510 --> 01:57:53,520
work we'll just wait
 

6937
01:57:53,520 --> 01:57:56,470
work we'll just wait
wait it out they'll probably hurt

6938
01:57:56,470 --> 01:57:56,480
wait it out they'll probably hurt
 

6939
01:57:56,480 --> 01:57:58,149
wait it out they'll probably hurt
themselves

6940
01:57:58,149 --> 01:57:58,159
themselves
 

6941
01:57:58,159 --> 01:58:00,629
themselves
let me ask you um people often kind of

6942
01:58:00,629 --> 01:58:00,639
let me ask you um people often kind of
 

6943
01:58:00,639 --> 01:58:02,470
let me ask you um people often kind of
wonder

6944
01:58:02,470 --> 01:58:02,480
wonder
 

6945
01:58:02,480 --> 01:58:05,430
wonder
world-class researchers such as yourself

6946
01:58:05,430 --> 01:58:05,440
world-class researchers such as yourself
 

6947
01:58:05,440 --> 01:58:05,990
world-class researchers such as yourself
what kind

6948
01:58:05,990 --> 01:58:06,000
what kind
 

6949
01:58:06,000 --> 01:58:09,830
what kind
of books technical fiction philosophical

6950
01:58:09,830 --> 01:58:09,840
of books technical fiction philosophical
 

6951
01:58:09,840 --> 01:58:11,910
of books technical fiction philosophical
were

6952
01:58:11,910 --> 01:58:11,920
were
 

6953
01:58:11,920 --> 01:58:14,950
were
had an impact on you in your life and

6954

had an impact on you in your life and
 

6955
01:58:14,960 --> 01:58:17,589
had an impact on you in your life and
maybe ones you could prob possibly

6956
01:58:17,589 --> 01:58:17,599
maybe ones you could prob possibly
 

6957
01:58:17,599 --> 01:58:18,950
maybe ones you could prob possibly
recommend

6958
01:58:18,950 --> 01:58:18,960
recommend
 

6959
01:58:18,960 --> 01:58:21,189
recommend
that others read maybe if you have three

6960
01:58:21,189 --> 01:58:21,199
that others read maybe if you have three
 

6961
01:58:21,199 --> 01:58:23,189
that others read maybe if you have three
books that pop in the mind

6962
01:58:23,189 --> 01:58:23,199
books that pop in the mind
 

6963
01:58:23,199 --> 01:58:25,830
books that pop in the mind
yeah so i definitely liked uh judy

6964
01:58:25,830 --> 01:58:25,840
yeah so i definitely liked uh judy
 

6965
01:58:25,840 --> 01:58:26,390
yeah so i definitely liked uh judy
apple's

6966
01:58:26,390 --> 01:58:26,400
apple's
 

6967
01:58:26,400 --> 01:58:28,390
apple's
book uh probabilistic reasoning and

6968
01:58:28,390 --> 01:58:28,400
book uh probabilistic reasoning and
 

6969
01:58:28,400 --> 01:58:29,750
book uh probabilistic reasoning and
intelligence systems

6970
01:58:29,750 --> 01:58:29,760
intelligence systems
 

6971
01:58:29,760 --> 01:58:32,709
intelligence systems
it's um it's a very deep technical book

6972
01:58:32,709 --> 01:58:32,719
it's um it's a very deep technical book
 

6973
01:58:32,719 --> 01:58:34,550
it's um it's a very deep technical book
but what i liked is that

6974
01:58:34,550 --> 01:58:34,560
but what i liked is that
 

6975
01:58:34,560 --> 01:58:36,550
but what i liked is that
so there are many uh places where you

6976
01:58:36,550 --> 01:58:36,560
so there are many uh places where you
 

6977
01:58:36,560 --> 01:58:37,589
so there are many uh places where you
can learn about

6978
01:58:37,589 --> 01:58:37,599
can learn about
 

6979
01:58:37,599 --> 01:58:40,149
can learn about
probabilistic graphical models from but

6980
01:58:40,149 --> 01:58:40,159
probabilistic graphical models from but
 

6981
01:58:40,159 --> 01:58:41,750
probabilistic graphical models from but
throughout this book judea pulls

01:58:41,750 --> 01:58:41,760
throughout this book judea pulls
 

6983
01:58:41,760 --> 01:58:44,310
throughout this book judea pulls
kind of sprinkles his philosophical

6984
01:58:44,310 --> 01:58:44,320
kind of sprinkles his philosophical
 

6985
01:58:44,320 --> 01:58:45,510
kind of sprinkles his philosophical
observations and

6986
01:58:45,510 --> 01:58:45,520
observations and
 

6987
01:58:45,520 --> 01:58:48,390
observations and
and he thinks about us to how the brain

6988
01:58:48,390 --> 01:58:48,400
and he thinks about us to how the brain
 

6989
01:58:48,400 --> 01:58:50,629
and he thinks about us to how the brain
thinks and attentions and resources

6990
01:58:50,629 --> 01:58:50,639
thinks and attentions and resources
 

6991
01:58:50,639 --> 01:58:53,109
thinks and attentions and resources
all those things so so that whole thing

6992
01:58:53,109 --> 01:58:53,119
all those things so so that whole thing
 

6993
01:58:53,119 --> 01:58:53,750
all those things so so that whole thing
makes it

6994
01:58:53,750 --> 01:58:53,760
makes it
 

6995
01:58:53,760 --> 01:58:55,350
makes it
more interesting to read uh he

6996
01:58:55,350 --> 01:58:55,360
more interesting to read uh he
 

6997
01:58:55,360 --> 01:58:57,830
more interesting to read uh he
emphasizes the importance of causality

6998
01:58:57,830 --> 01:58:57,840
emphasizes the importance of causality
 

6999
01:58:57,840 --> 01:58:59,750
emphasizes the importance of causality
so that was in his later book so this

7000
01:58:59,750 --> 01:58:59,760
so that was in his later book so this
 

7001
01:58:59,760 --> 01:59:01,189
so that was in his later book so this
was the first book probabilistic

7002
01:59:01,189 --> 01:59:01,199
was the first book probabilistic
 

7003
01:59:01,199 --> 01:59:02,870
was the first book probabilistic
reasoning in interlinked systems he

7004
01:59:02,870 --> 01:59:02,880
reasoning in interlinked systems he
 

7005
01:59:02,880 --> 01:59:05,669
reasoning in interlinked systems he
mentions causality but he hadn't really

7006
01:59:05,669 --> 01:59:05,679
mentions causality but he hadn't really
 

7007
01:59:05,679 --> 01:59:07,270
mentions causality but he hadn't really
sunk his teeth into

7008
01:59:07,270 --> 01:59:07,280
sunk his teeth into
 

7009
01:59:07,280 --> 01:59:08,550
sunk his teeth into
like you know how do you actually

7010
01:59:08,550 --> 01:59:08,560
like you know how do you actually
 

7011
01:59:08,560 --> 01:59:10,629
like you know how do you actually
formalize that yeah and

7012
01:59:10,629 --> 01:59:10,639
formalize that yeah and
 

7013
01:59:10,639 --> 01:59:13,030
formalize that yeah and
uh the second book causality so two

7014
01:59:13,030 --> 01:59:13,040
uh the second book causality so two
 

7015
01:59:13,040 --> 01:59:13,910
uh the second book causality so two
thousand uh

7016
01:59:13,910 --> 01:59:13,920
thousand uh
 

7017
01:59:13,920 --> 01:59:15,589
thousand uh
the one in two thousand that one is

7018
01:59:15,589 --> 01:59:15,599
the one in two thousand that one is
 

7019
01:59:15,599 --> 01:59:17,189
the one in two thousand that one is
really hard so i wouldn't recommend that

7020
01:59:17,189 --> 01:59:17,199
really hard so i wouldn't recommend that
 

7021
01:59:17,199 --> 01:59:17,669
really hard so i wouldn't recommend that
uh

7022
01:59:17,669 --> 01:59:17,679
uh
 

7023
01:59:17,679 --> 01:59:19,350
uh
uh yes so that looks at the like the

7024
01:59:19,350 --> 01:59:19,360
uh yes so that looks at the like the
 

7025
01:59:19,360 --> 01:59:20,870
uh yes so that looks at the like the
mathematical like

7026
01:59:20,870 --> 01:59:20,880
mathematical like
 

7027
01:59:20,880 --> 01:59:23,990
mathematical like
his model of uh calculus do calculus

7028
01:59:23,990 --> 01:59:24,000
his model of uh calculus do calculus
 

7029
01:59:24,000 --> 01:59:25,669
his model of uh calculus do calculus
yeah it was pretty dense mathematically

7030
01:59:25,669 --> 01:59:25,679
yeah it was pretty dense mathematically
 

7031
01:59:25,679 --> 01:59:25,990
yeah it was pretty dense mathematically
right

7032
01:59:25,990 --> 01:59:26,000
right
 

7033
01:59:26,000 --> 01:59:27,830
right
yeah right uh the book of why is

7034
01:59:27,830 --> 01:59:27,840
yeah right uh the book of why is
 

7035
01:59:27,840 --> 01:59:29,430
yeah right uh the book of why is
definitely more enjoyable oh for sure

7036
01:59:29,430 --> 01:59:29,440
definitely more enjoyable oh for sure
 

7037
01:59:29,440 --> 01:59:29,990
definitely more enjoyable oh for sure
yeah

7038
01:59:29,990 --> 01:59:30,000
yeah
 

7039

yeah
um so yeah so i would i would recommend

um so yeah so i would i would recommend
 

7041
01:59:31,840 --> 01:59:33,430
um so yeah so i would i would recommend

physical books i have because yeah
 

7079
02:00:07,679 --> 02:00:09,350
physical books i have because yeah
anyway there's a lot of people

7080
02:00:09,350 --> 02:00:09,360
anyway there's a lot of people
 

7081
02:00:09,360 --> 02:00:10,870
anyway there's a lot of people
recommended it highly so

7082

recommended it highly so
 

7083
02:00:10,880 --> 02:00:13,270
recommended it highly so
yeah and the third one uh i would

7084
02:00:13,270 --> 02:00:13,280
yeah and the third one uh i would
 

7085
02:00:13,280 --> 02:00:15,669
yeah and the third one uh i would
definitely recommend reading is um

7086
02:00:15,669 --> 02:00:15,679
definitely recommend reading is um
 

7087
02:00:15,679 --> 02:00:18,709
definitely recommend reading is um
uh this is not a technical book it is

7088
02:00:18,709 --> 02:00:18,719
uh this is not a technical book it is
 

7089
02:00:18,719 --> 02:00:21,750
uh this is not a technical book it is
history it's called it's the name of the

7090
02:00:21,750 --> 02:00:21,760
history it's called it's the name of the

uh fascinating how a
 

7105
02:00:40,400 --> 02:00:43,030
uh fascinating how a
flight was uh you know treated as an

7106
02:00:43,030 --> 02:00:43,040
flight was uh you know treated as an
 

7107
02:00:43,040 --> 02:00:44,550
flight was uh you know treated as an
unsolvable problem

7108
02:00:44,550 --> 02:00:44,560
unsolvable problem
 

7109
02:00:44,560 --> 02:00:47,270
unsolvable problem
and and and also you know what aspects

7110
02:00:47,270 --> 02:00:47,280
and and and also you know what aspects
 

7111
02:00:47,280 --> 02:00:47,910
and and and also you know what aspects
did people

7112
02:00:47,910 --> 02:00:47,920
did people
 

7113
02:00:47,920 --> 02:00:50,629
did people
emphasize uh you know people thought oh

7114
02:00:50,629 --> 02:00:50,639
emphasize uh you know people thought oh
 

7115
02:00:50,639 --> 02:00:52,149
emphasize uh you know people thought oh
it is all about

7116
02:00:52,149 --> 02:00:52,159
it is all about
 

7117
02:00:52,159 --> 02:00:54,790
it is all about
the just powerful engines you know just

7118
02:00:54,790 --> 02:00:54,800
the just powerful engines you know just
 

7119
02:00:54,800 --> 02:00:56,229
the just powerful engines you know just
need to have powerful lightweight

7120
02:00:56,229 --> 02:00:56,239
need to have powerful lightweight
 

7121
02:00:56,239 --> 02:00:57,030
need to have powerful lightweight
engines

7122
02:00:57,030 --> 02:00:57,040
engines
 

7123
02:00:57,040 --> 02:01:00,470
engines
uh and um so

7124
02:01:00,470 --> 02:01:00,480
uh and um so
 

7125
02:01:00,480 --> 02:01:01,910
uh and um so
you know some people thought of it as

7126
02:01:01,910 --> 02:01:01,920
you know some people thought of it as
 

7127
02:01:01,920 --> 02:01:03,910
you know some people thought of it as
how far can we just throw the thing you

7128
02:01:03,910 --> 02:01:03,920
how far can we just throw the thing you
 

7129
02:01:03,920 --> 02:01:04,390
how far can we just throw the thing you
know

7130
02:01:04,390 --> 02:01:04,400
know
 

7131
02:01:04,400 --> 02:01:07,750
know
just throw it yeah catapult yeah so

7132
02:01:07,750 --> 02:01:07,760
just throw it yeah catapult yeah so
 

7133
02:01:07,760 --> 02:01:09,750
just throw it yeah catapult yeah so
so it is it's a very fascinating and

7134
02:01:09,750 --> 02:01:09,760
so it is it's a very fascinating and
 

7135
02:01:09,760 --> 02:01:11,109
so it is it's a very fascinating and
even after they

7136
02:01:11,109 --> 02:01:11,119
even after they
 

7137
02:01:11,119 --> 02:01:13,589
even after they
uh made the invention of people not

7138
02:01:13,589 --> 02:01:13,599
uh made the invention of people not
 

7139
02:01:13,599 --> 02:01:14,470
uh made the invention of people not
believing it and

7140
02:01:14,470 --> 02:01:14,480
believing it and
 

7141
02:01:14,480 --> 02:01:16,950
believing it and
uh uh the social aspect of it this is

7142
02:01:16,950 --> 02:01:16,960
uh uh the social aspect of it this is
 

7143
02:01:16,960 --> 02:01:17,910
uh uh the social aspect of it this is
the social aspect

7144
02:01:17,910 --> 02:01:17,920
the social aspect
 

7145
02:01:17,920 --> 02:01:20,070
the social aspect
it's a different you know very important

7146
02:01:20,070 --> 02:01:20,080
it's a different you know very important
 

7147
02:01:20,080 --> 02:01:21,990
it's a different you know very important
do you uh draw any parallels

7148
02:01:21,990 --> 02:01:22,000
do you uh draw any parallels
 

7149
02:01:22,000 --> 02:01:25,270
do you uh draw any parallels
between you know birds fly

7150
02:01:25,270 --> 02:01:25,280
between you know birds fly
 

7151
02:01:25,280 --> 02:01:27,910
between you know birds fly
so there's the natural approach to uh to

7152
02:01:27,910 --> 02:01:27,920
so there's the natural approach to uh to
 

7153
02:01:27,920 --> 02:01:29,830
so there's the natural approach to uh to
flight and then there's the engineered

7154
02:01:29,830 --> 02:01:29,840
flight and then there's the engineered
 

7155
02:01:29,840 --> 02:01:30,550
flight and then there's the engineered
approach

7156
02:01:30,550 --> 02:01:30,560
approach
 

7157
02:01:30,560 --> 02:01:32,870
approach
do you um do you see the same kind of

7158
02:01:32,870 --> 02:01:32,880
do you um do you see the same kind of
 

7159
02:01:32,880 --> 02:01:33,990
do you um do you see the same kind of
thing with the brain

7160
02:01:33,990 --> 02:01:34,000
thing with the brain
 

7161
02:01:34,000 --> 02:01:37,270
thing with the brain
and are trying to engineer intelligence

7162
02:01:37,270 --> 02:01:37,280
and are trying to engineer intelligence
 

7163
02:01:37,280 --> 02:01:40,470
and are trying to engineer intelligence
yeah it's it's a good analogy to have uh

7164
02:01:40,470 --> 02:01:40,480
yeah it's it's a good analogy to have uh
 

7165
02:01:40,480 --> 02:01:42,870
yeah it's it's a good analogy to have uh
of course all analogies have their you

7166
02:01:42,870 --> 02:01:42,880
of course all analogies have their you
 

7167
02:01:42,880 --> 02:01:43,669
of course all analogies have their you
know uh yeah

7168
02:01:43,669 --> 02:01:43,679
know uh yeah
 

7169
02:01:43,679 --> 02:01:46,870
know uh yeah

so for sure so people in
uh you know ai often uh use

7172
02:01:50,310 --> 02:01:50,320
uh you know ai often uh use
 

7173
02:01:50,320 --> 02:01:53,030
uh you know ai often uh use
airplanes as an example of hey we didn't

7174
02:01:53,030 --> 02:01:53,040
airplanes as an example of hey we didn't
 

7175
02:01:53,040 --> 02:01:54,470
airplanes as an example of hey we didn't
learn anything from birds look right

7176
02:01:54,470 --> 02:01:54,480
learn anything from birds look right
 

7177
02:01:54,480 --> 02:01:55,109
learn anything from birds look right
there yeah

7178
02:01:55,109 --> 02:01:55,119
there yeah
 

7179
02:01:55,119 --> 02:01:57,669
there yeah

that you don't need to flap to fly

7192
02:02:08,870 --> 02:02:08,880
that you don't need to flap to fly
 

7193
02:02:08,880 --> 02:02:10,950
that you don't need to flap to fly
is something right brothers found by

7194
02:02:10,950 --> 02:02:10,960
is something right brothers found by
 

7195
02:02:10,960 --> 02:02:14,550
is something right brothers found by
observing birds

7196
02:02:14,550 --> 02:02:14,560

 

7197
02:02:14,560 --> 02:02:17,350

yeah so they have in their notebook you

7198
02:02:17,350 --> 02:02:17,360
yeah so they have in their notebook you
 

7199
02:02:17,360 --> 02:02:18,390
yeah so they have in their notebook you
know in some of these

7200
02:02:18,390 --> 02:02:18,400
know in some of these
 

7201
02:02:18,400 --> 02:02:20,070
know in some of these
books they show their notebook drawings

7202
02:02:20,070 --> 02:02:20,080
books they show their notebook drawings
 

7203
02:02:20,080 --> 02:02:21,510
books they show their notebook drawings
right they they

7204
02:02:21,510 --> 02:02:21,520
right they they
 

7205
02:02:21,520 --> 02:02:23,990
right they they
make detailed notes about buzzards uh

7206
02:02:23,990 --> 02:02:24,000
make detailed notes about buzzards uh
 

7207
02:02:24,000 --> 02:02:24,709
make detailed notes about buzzards uh
just

7208
02:02:24,709 --> 02:02:24,719
just
 

7209
02:02:24,719 --> 02:02:27,430
just
soaring over the thermals and they

7210
02:02:27,430 --> 02:02:27,440
soaring over the thermals and they
 

7211
02:02:27,440 --> 02:02:28,229
soaring over the thermals and they
basically say

7212
02:02:28,229 --> 02:02:28,239
basically say
 

7213
02:02:28,239 --> 02:02:30,470
basically say
look flapping is not the important

7214
02:02:30,470 --> 02:02:30,480
look flapping is not the important
 

7215
02:02:30,480 --> 02:02:32,149
look flapping is not the important
propulsion is not the important problem

7216

we want to solve control uh and uh once
 

7221
02:02:36,320 --> 02:02:38,070
we want to solve control uh and uh once
you solve control propagation will fall

7222
02:02:38,070 --> 02:02:38,080
you solve control propagation will fall
 

7223
02:02:38,080 --> 02:02:38,790

piece of advice should be taken with a
 

7263
02:03:13,199 --> 02:03:14,709
piece of advice should be taken with a
pinch of salt of course

7264
02:03:14,709 --> 02:03:14,719
pinch of salt of course
 

7265
02:03:14,719 --> 02:03:16,790

ideas uh that uh that they get from the
brain

7358
02:04:51,750 --> 02:04:51,760
brain
 

7359
02:04:51,760 --> 02:04:54,229
brain
into and then explore how those could be

7360
02:04:54,229 --> 02:04:54,239
into and then explore how those could be
 

7361
02:04:54,239 --> 02:04:55,270
into and then explore how those could be
used to uh

7362
02:04:55,270 --> 02:04:55,280
used to uh
 

7363
02:04:55,280 --> 02:04:57,030
used to uh
to create intelligent systems so that

7364
02:04:57,030 --> 02:04:57,040
to create intelligent systems so that
 

7365
02:04:57,040 --> 02:04:59,270
to create intelligent systems so that
might be the right department actually

7366
02:04:59,270 --> 02:04:59,280
might be the right department actually
 

7367
02:04:59,280 --> 02:05:02,229
might be the right department actually
to uh so this was a question in uh uh

7368
02:05:02,229 --> 02:05:02,239
to uh so this was a question in uh uh
 

7369
02:05:02,239 --> 02:05:03,109
to uh so this was a question in uh uh
you know one of the

7370
02:05:03,109 --> 02:05:03,119
you know one of the
 

7371
02:05:03,119 --> 02:05:05,030
you know one of the
redwood neuroscience institute workshops

7372
02:05:05,030 --> 02:05:05,040
redwood neuroscience institute workshops
 

7373
02:05:05,040 --> 02:05:08,629
redwood neuroscience institute workshops
or that jeff hawkins organized

7374
02:05:08,629 --> 02:05:08,639
or that jeff hawkins organized
 

7375
02:05:08,639 --> 02:05:10,470
or that jeff hawkins organized
almost 10 years ago this question was

7376
02:05:10,470 --> 02:05:10,480
almost 10 years ago this question was
 

7377
02:05:10,480 --> 02:05:12,229
almost 10 years ago this question was
put to a panel right what what should be

7378
02:05:12,229 --> 02:05:12,239
put to a panel right what what should be
 

7379
02:05:12,239 --> 02:05:13,830
put to a panel right what what should be
the undergrad major

7380
02:05:13,830 --> 02:05:13,840
the undergrad major
 

7381
02:05:13,840 --> 02:05:14,950
the undergrad major
you should take if you want to

7382
02:05:14,950 --> 02:05:14,960
you should take if you want to
 

7383
02:05:14,960 --> 02:05:17,189
you should take if you want to
understand the brain and uh

7384
02:05:17,189 --> 02:05:17,199
understand the brain and uh
 

7385
02:05:17,199 --> 02:05:19,910
understand the brain and uh
and the majority opinion that one was

7386
02:05:19,910 --> 02:05:19,920
and the majority opinion that one was
 

7387
02:05:19,920 --> 02:05:22,069
and the majority opinion that one was
electrical engineering

7388
02:05:22,069 --> 02:05:22,079
electrical engineering
 

7389
02:05:22,079 --> 02:05:25,030
electrical engineering
interesting uh because i mean i'm a

7390
02:05:25,030 --> 02:05:25,040
interesting uh because i mean i'm a
 

7391
02:05:25,040 --> 02:05:26,870
interesting uh because i mean i'm a
doubly undergrad so i got lucky in that

7392
02:05:26,870 --> 02:05:26,880
doubly undergrad so i got lucky in that
 

7393
02:05:26,880 --> 02:05:28,149
doubly undergrad so i got lucky in that
way

7394
02:05:28,149 --> 02:05:28,159
way
 

7395
02:05:28,159 --> 02:05:30,229
way
but it i i think it does have some of

7396
02:05:30,229 --> 02:05:30,239
but it i i think it does have some of
 

7397
02:05:30,239 --> 02:05:31,830
but it i i think it does have some of
the right ingredients because

7398
02:05:31,830 --> 02:05:31,840
the right ingredients because
 

7399
02:05:31,840 --> 02:05:34,149
the right ingredients because
you learn about circuits you you learn

7400
02:05:34,149 --> 02:05:34,159
you learn about circuits you you learn
 

7401
02:05:34,159 --> 02:05:34,870
you learn about circuits you you learn
about

7402
02:05:34,870 --> 02:05:34,880
about
 

7403
02:05:34,880 --> 02:05:37,750
about
how you can construct circuits to uh you

7404
02:05:37,750 --> 02:05:37,760
how you can construct circuits to uh you
 

7405
02:05:37,760 --> 02:05:39,430
how you can construct circuits to uh you
know approach you know do functions

7406
02:05:39,430 --> 02:05:39,440
know approach you know do functions
 

7407
02:05:39,440 --> 02:05:42,470
know approach you know do functions
uh you learn about microprocessors um

7408
02:05:42,470 --> 02:05:42,480
uh you learn about microprocessors um
 

7409
02:05:42,480 --> 02:05:43,990
uh you learn about microprocessors um
you learn information theory you learn

7410
02:05:43,990 --> 02:05:44,000
you learn information theory you learn
 

7411
02:05:44,000 --> 02:05:45,669
you learn information theory you learn
signal processing uh you learn

7412
02:05:45,669 --> 02:05:45,679
signal processing uh you learn
 

7413
02:05:45,679 --> 02:05:46,550
signal processing uh you learn
continuous math

7414
02:05:46,550 --> 02:05:46,560
continuous math
 

7415
02:05:46,560 --> 02:05:49,910
continuous math
so um so in that way it's it's a good

7416
02:05:49,910 --> 02:05:49,920
so um so in that way it's it's a good
 

7417
02:05:49,920 --> 02:05:50,870
so um so in that way it's it's a good
step

7418
02:05:50,870 --> 02:05:50,880
step
 

7419
02:05:50,880 --> 02:05:52,950
step
to if you want to go to computer science

7420
02:05:52,950 --> 02:05:52,960
to if you want to go to computer science
 

7421
02:05:52,960 --> 02:05:54,950
to if you want to go to computer science
or neuroscience you can it's a good step

7422
02:05:54,950 --> 02:05:54,960
or neuroscience you can it's a good step
 

7423
02:05:54,960 --> 02:05:56,870
or neuroscience you can it's a good step
the downside

7424
02:05:56,870 --> 02:05:56,880
the downside
 

7425
02:05:56,880 --> 02:05:59,030
the downside
you're more likely to be forced to use

7426
02:05:59,030 --> 02:05:59,040
you're more likely to be forced to use
 

7427
02:05:59,040 --> 02:06:00,110
you're more likely to be forced to use
matlab

7428
02:06:00,110 --> 02:06:00,120
matlab
 

7429
02:06:00,120 --> 02:06:05,589
matlab
[Laughter]

7430
02:06:05,589 --> 02:06:05,599
[Laughter]
 

7431
02:06:05,599 --> 02:06:07,830
[Laughter]
one of the interesting things about i

7432
02:06:07,830 --> 02:06:07,840
one of the interesting things about i
 

7433
02:06:07,840 --> 02:06:09,189
one of the interesting things about i
mean this is changing the world is

7434
02:06:09,189 --> 02:06:09,199
mean this is changing the world is
 

7435
02:06:09,199 --> 02:06:10,470
mean this is changing the world is
changing but

7436
02:06:10,470 --> 02:06:10,480
changing but
 

7437
02:06:10,480 --> 02:06:13,189
changing but
uh like certain departments lagged on

7438
02:06:13,189 --> 02:06:13,199
uh like certain departments lagged on
 

7439
02:06:13,199 --> 02:06:15,189
uh like certain departments lagged on
the programming side of things

7440
02:06:15,189 --> 02:06:15,199
the programming side of things
 

7441
02:06:15,199 --> 02:06:17,430
the programming side of things
on developing good uh good habits as a

7442
02:06:17,430 --> 02:06:17,440
on developing good uh good habits as a
 

7443
02:06:17,440 --> 02:06:19,189
on developing good uh good habits as a
software engineering but i think that's

7444
02:06:19,189 --> 02:06:19,199
software engineering but i think that's
 

7445
02:06:19,199 --> 02:06:20,790
software engineering but i think that's
more and more changing

7446
02:06:20,790 --> 02:06:20,800
more and more changing
 

7447
02:06:20,800 --> 02:06:23,750
more and more changing
and and students can take that into

7448
02:06:23,750 --> 02:06:23,760
and and students can take that into
 

7449
02:06:23,760 --> 02:06:24,550
and and students can take that into
their own hands

7450
02:06:24,550 --> 02:06:24,560
their own hands
 

7451
02:06:24,560 --> 02:06:26,470
their own hands
like learn to program i feel like

7452
02:06:26,470 --> 02:06:26,480
like learn to program i feel like
 

7453
02:06:26,480 --> 02:06:27,589
like learn to program i feel like
everybody

7454
02:06:27,589 --> 02:06:27,599
everybody
 

7455
02:06:27,599 --> 02:06:31,270
everybody
should learn to program because it

7456
02:06:31,270 --> 02:06:31,280
should learn to program because it
 

7457
02:06:31,280 --> 02:06:34,390
should learn to program because it
uh like everyone in the sciences

7458
02:06:34,390 --> 02:06:34,400
uh like everyone in the sciences
 

7459
02:06:34,400 --> 02:06:36,390
uh like everyone in the sciences
because it empowers it puts the data at

7460
02:06:36,390 --> 02:06:36,400
because it empowers it puts the data at
 

7461
02:06:36,400 --> 02:06:37,669
because it empowers it puts the data at
your fingertips

7462
02:06:37,669 --> 02:06:37,679
your fingertips
 

7463
02:06:37,679 --> 02:06:40,149
your fingertips
so you can organize it you can find all

7464
02:06:40,149 --> 02:06:40,159
so you can organize it you can find all
 

7465
02:06:40,159 --> 02:06:41,669
so you can organize it you can find all
kinds of things in the data and then you

7466
02:06:41,669 --> 02:06:41,679
kinds of things in the data and then you
 

7467
02:06:41,679 --> 02:06:42,709
kinds of things in the data and then you
can also

7468
02:06:42,709 --> 02:06:42,719
can also
 

7469
02:06:42,719 --> 02:06:44,870
can also
for the appropriate sciences build

7470
02:06:44,870 --> 02:06:44,880
for the appropriate sciences build
 

7471
02:06:44,880 --> 02:06:46,310
for the appropriate sciences build
systems that

7472
02:06:46,310 --> 02:06:46,320
systems that
 

7473
02:06:46,320 --> 02:06:48,950
systems that
like based on that so like then engineer

7474
02:06:48,950 --> 02:06:48,960
like based on that so like then engineer
 

7475
02:06:48,960 --> 02:06:50,790
like based on that so like then engineer
intelligence systems

7476
02:06:50,790 --> 02:06:50,800
intelligence systems
 

7477
02:06:50,800 --> 02:06:53,270
intelligence systems
uh we already talked about mortality so

7478
02:06:53,270 --> 02:06:53,280
uh we already talked about mortality so
 

7479
02:06:53,280 --> 02:06:53,910
uh we already talked about mortality so
we hit

7480
02:06:53,910 --> 02:06:53,920
we hit
 

7481
02:06:53,920 --> 02:06:57,030
we hit
no a ridiculous

7482
02:06:57,030 --> 02:06:57,040
no a ridiculous
 

7483
02:06:57,040 --> 02:07:00,069
no a ridiculous
point but let me ask you the

7484
02:07:00,069 --> 02:07:00,079
point but let me ask you the
 

7485
02:07:00,079 --> 02:07:04,870
point but let me ask you the
uh you know

7486
02:07:04,870 --> 02:07:04,880

 

7487
02:07:04,880 --> 02:07:08,069

one of the things about intelligence

7488
02:07:08,069 --> 02:07:08,079
one of the things about intelligence
 

7489
02:07:08,079 --> 02:07:11,589
one of the things about intelligence
is it's goal driven and you study the

7490
02:07:11,589 --> 02:07:11,599
is it's goal driven and you study the
 

7491
02:07:11,599 --> 02:07:12,629
is it's goal driven and you study the
brain

7492
02:07:12,629 --> 02:07:12,639
brain
 

7493
02:07:12,639 --> 02:07:14,470
brain
so the question is like what's the goal

7494
02:07:14,470 --> 02:07:14,480
so the question is like what's the goal
 

7495
02:07:14,480 --> 02:07:16,229
so the question is like what's the goal
that the brain is operating under what's

7496
02:07:16,229 --> 02:07:16,239
that the brain is operating under what's
 

7497
02:07:16,239 --> 02:07:17,750
that the brain is operating under what's
what's the meaning of it all for us

7498
02:07:17,750 --> 02:07:17,760
what's the meaning of it all for us
 

7499
02:07:17,760 --> 02:07:18,390
what's the meaning of it all for us
humans

7500
02:07:18,390 --> 02:07:18,400
humans
 

7501
02:07:18,400 --> 02:07:22,470
humans
in your view what's the meaning of life

7502
02:07:22,470 --> 02:07:22,480
in your view what's the meaning of life
 

7503
02:07:22,480 --> 02:07:23,990
in your view what's the meaning of life
the meaning of life is whatever you

7504
02:07:23,990 --> 02:07:24,000
the meaning of life is whatever you
 

7505
02:07:24,000 --> 02:07:26,470
the meaning of life is whatever you
construct out of it it's completely open

7506
02:07:26,470 --> 02:07:26,480
construct out of it it's completely open
 

7507
02:07:26,480 --> 02:07:29,030
construct out of it it's completely open
it's open yeah so there's no there's

7508
02:07:29,030 --> 02:07:29,040
it's open yeah so there's no there's
 

7509
02:07:29,040 --> 02:07:30,310
it's open yeah so there's no there's
nothing uh

7510
02:07:30,310 --> 02:07:30,320
nothing uh
 

7511
02:07:30,320 --> 02:07:32,149
nothing uh
uh like you mentioned you like

7512
02:07:32,149 --> 02:07:32,159
uh like you mentioned you like
 

7513
02:07:32,159 --> 02:07:34,069
uh like you mentioned you like
constraints

7514
02:07:34,069 --> 02:07:34,079
constraints
 

7515
02:07:34,079 --> 02:07:37,189
constraints
what's uh it's it's wide open is there

7516
02:07:37,189 --> 02:07:37,199
what's uh it's it's wide open is there
 

7517
02:07:37,199 --> 02:07:40,870
what's uh it's it's wide open is there
is there some useful aspect that you

7518
02:07:40,870 --> 02:07:40,880
is there some useful aspect that you
 

7519
02:07:40,880 --> 02:07:41,589
is there some useful aspect that you
think about

7520
02:07:41,589 --> 02:07:41,599
