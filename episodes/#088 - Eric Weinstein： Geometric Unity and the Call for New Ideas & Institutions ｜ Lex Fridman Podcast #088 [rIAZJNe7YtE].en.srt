00:03:19,800 --> 00:03:19,810
I was very moved by the Soviet custom of
 

165
00:03:19,810 --> 00:03:21,750
I was very moved by the Soviet custom of
newlyweds going and visiting war

166
00:03:21,750 --> 00:03:21,760
newlyweds going and visiting war
 

167
00:03:21,760 --> 00:03:23,490
newlyweds going and visiting war
memorials on their wedding day it's like

168
00:03:23,490 --> 00:03:23,500
memorials on their wedding day it's like
 

169
00:03:23,500 --> 00:03:24,630
memorials on their wedding day it's like
the happiest day of your life you have

170
00:03:24,630 --> 00:03:24,640
the happiest day of your life you have
 

171
00:03:24,640 --> 00:03:26,310
the happiest day of your life you have
to say thank you to the people who made

172
00:03:26,310 --> 00:03:26,320
to say thank you to the people who made
 

173
00:03:26,320 --> 00:03:29,340
to say thank you to the people who made
it possible we're not there where we're

174
00:03:29,340 --> 00:03:29,350
it possible we're not there where we're
 

175
00:03:29,350 --> 00:03:33,720
it possible we're not there where we're
just restarting history we you know I've

176
00:03:33,720 --> 00:03:33,730
just restarting history we you know I've
 

177
00:03:33,730 --> 00:03:35,610
just restarting history we you know I've
called this on the Rogen program I

178
00:03:35,610 --> 00:03:35,620
called this on the Rogen program I
 

179
00:03:35,620 --> 00:03:38,310
called this on the Rogen program I
called it the great nap yeah 75 years

180
00:03:38,310 --> 00:03:38,320
called it the great nap yeah 75 years
 

181
00:03:38,320 --> 00:03:41,940
called it the great nap yeah 75 years
with very little by historical standards

182
00:03:41,940 --> 00:03:41,950
with very little by historical standards
 

183
00:03:41,950 --> 00:03:45,210
with very little by historical standards
and in in terms of really profound

184
00:03:45,210 --> 00:03:45,220
and in in terms of really profound
 

185
00:03:45,220 --> 00:03:47,460
and in in terms of really profound
disruption and so when you called the

186
00:03:47,460 --> 00:03:47,470
disruption and so when you called the
 

187
00:03:47,470 --> 00:03:50,310
disruption and so when you called the
great nap meaning lack of deep global

188
00:03:50,310 --> 00:03:50,320
great nap meaning lack of deep global
 

189
00:03:50,320 --> 00:03:54,120
great nap meaning lack of deep global
tragedy well lack of realized global

190
00:03:54,120 --> 00:03:54,130
tragedy well lack of realized global
 

191
00:03:54,130 --> 00:03:56,039
tragedy well lack of realized global
tragedy so I think the development for

192
00:03:56,039 --> 00:03:56,049
tragedy so I think the development for
 

193
00:03:56,049 --> 00:03:59,039
tragedy so I think the development for
example of the hydrogen bomb you know

194
00:03:59,039 --> 00:03:59,049
example of the hydrogen bomb you know
 

195
00:03:59,049 --> 00:04:01,410
example of the hydrogen bomb you know
was something that happened during the

196
00:04:01,410 --> 00:04:01,420
was something that happened during the
 

197
00:04:01,420 --> 00:04:06,030
was something that happened during the
great nap and that doesn't mean that

198
00:04:06,030 --> 00:04:06,040
great nap and that doesn't mean that
 

199
00:04:06,040 --> 00:04:08,160
great nap and that doesn't mean that
people who lived during that time didn't

200
00:04:08,160 --> 00:04:08,170
people who lived during that time didn't
 

201
00:04:08,170 --> 00:04:11,580
people who lived during that time didn't
feel feared and no anxiety but it was to

202
00:04:11,580 --> 00:04:11,590
feel feared and no anxiety but it was to
 

203
00:04:11,590 --> 00:04:13,590
feel feared and no anxiety but it was to
say that most of the violent potential

204
00:04:13,590 --> 00:04:13,600
say that most of the violent potential
 

205
00:04:13,600 --> 00:04:16,319
say that most of the violent potential
of human species was not realized it was

206
00:04:16,319 --> 00:04:16,329
of human species was not realized it was
 

207
00:04:16,329 --> 00:04:18,570
of human species was not realized it was
in the form of potential energy and this

208
00:04:18,570 --> 00:04:18,580
in the form of potential energy and this
 

209
00:04:18,580 --> 00:04:20,339
in the form of potential energy and this
is the thing that I've sort of taken

210
00:04:20,339 --> 00:04:20,349
is the thing that I've sort of taken
 

211
00:04:20,349 --> 00:04:21,720
is the thing that I've sort of taken
issue with with the

212
00:04:21,720 --> 00:04:21,730
issue with with the
 

213
00:04:21,730 --> 00:04:24,420
issue with with the
of Steven Pinker's optimism is that if

214
00:04:24,420 --> 00:04:24,430
of Steven Pinker's optimism is that if
 

215
00:04:24,430 --> 00:04:26,280
of Steven Pinker's optimism is that if
you look at they realized kinetic

216
00:04:26,280 --> 00:04:26,290
you look at they realized kinetic
 

217
00:04:26,290 --> 00:04:27,720
you look at they realized kinetic
variables things have been getting much

218
00:04:27,720 --> 00:04:27,730
variables things have been getting much
 

219
00:04:27,730 --> 00:04:29,250
variables things have been getting much
better for a long time which is the

220
00:04:29,250 --> 00:04:29,260
better for a long time which is the
 

221
00:04:29,260 --> 00:04:32,670
better for a long time which is the
great nap but it's not as if our

222
00:04:32,670 --> 00:04:32,680
great nap but it's not as if our
 

223
00:04:32,680 --> 00:04:35,160
great nap but it's not as if our
fragility has not grown our dependence

224
00:04:35,160 --> 00:04:35,170
fragility has not grown our dependence
 

225
00:04:35,170 --> 00:04:37,830
fragility has not grown our dependence
on electronic systems our vulnerability

226
00:04:37,830 --> 00:04:37,840
on electronic systems our vulnerability
 

227
00:04:37,840 --> 00:04:40,590
on electronic systems our vulnerability
to disruption and so all sorts of things

228
00:04:40,590 --> 00:04:40,600
to disruption and so all sorts of things
 

229
00:04:40,600 --> 00:04:42,930
to disruption and so all sorts of things
have gotten much better what other

230
00:04:42,930 --> 00:04:42,940
have gotten much better what other
 

231
00:04:42,940 --> 00:04:44,880
have gotten much better what other
things have gotten much worse in the

232
00:04:44,880 --> 00:04:44,890
things have gotten much worse in the
 

233
00:04:44,890 --> 00:04:47,850
things have gotten much worse in the
destructive potential of skyrocketed its

234
00:04:47,850 --> 00:04:47,860
destructive potential of skyrocketed its
 

235
00:04:47,860 --> 00:04:50,460
destructive potential of skyrocketed its
tragedy the only way we wake up from the

236
00:04:50,460 --> 00:04:50,470
tragedy the only way we wake up from the
 

237
00:04:50,470 --> 00:04:54,390
tragedy the only way we wake up from the
big nap well no you could also have you

238
00:04:54,390 --> 00:04:54,400
big nap well no you could also have you
 

239
00:04:54,400 --> 00:04:56,910
big nap well no you could also have you
know jubilation about positive things

240
00:04:56,910 --> 00:04:56,920
know jubilation about positive things
 

241
00:04:56,920 --> 00:04:58,710
know jubilation about positive things
but it's harder to get people's

242
00:04:58,710 --> 00:04:58,720
but it's harder to get people's
 

243
00:04:58,720 --> 00:05:00,600
but it's harder to get people's
attention can you give an example of a

244
00:05:00,600 --> 00:05:00,610
attention can you give an example of a
 

245
00:05:00,610 --> 00:05:03,060
attention can you give an example of a
big global positive thing well I could

246
00:05:03,060 --> 00:05:03,070
big global positive thing well I could
 

247
00:05:03,070 --> 00:05:04,710
big global positive thing well I could
happen I think that when for example

248
00:05:04,710 --> 00:05:04,720
happen I think that when for example
 

249
00:05:04,720 --> 00:05:09,270
happen I think that when for example
just historically speaking HIV went from

250
00:05:09,270 --> 00:05:09,280
just historically speaking HIV went from
 

251
00:05:09,280 --> 00:05:10,920
just historically speaking HIV went from
being a death sentence to something that

252
00:05:10,920 --> 00:05:10,930
being a death sentence to something that
 

253
00:05:10,930 --> 00:05:12,960
being a death sentence to something that
people could live with for a very long

254
00:05:12,960 --> 00:05:12,970
people could live with for a very long
 

255
00:05:12,970 --> 00:05:15,360
people could live with for a very long
period of time it would be great if that

256
00:05:15,360 --> 00:05:15,370
period of time it would be great if that
 

257
00:05:15,370 --> 00:05:17,700
period of time it would be great if that
had happened on a Wednesday right like

258
00:05:17,700 --> 00:05:17,710
had happened on a Wednesday right like
 

259
00:05:17,710 --> 00:05:19,440
had happened on a Wednesday right like
all at once like you knew that things

260
00:05:19,440 --> 00:05:19,450
all at once like you knew that things
 

261
00:05:19,450 --> 00:05:22,500
all at once like you knew that things
had changed and so the bleed in somewhat

262
00:05:22,500 --> 00:05:22,510
had changed and so the bleed in somewhat
 

263
00:05:22,510 --> 00:05:25,260
had changed and so the bleed in somewhat
kills the sort of the Wednesday effect

264
00:05:25,260 --> 00:05:25,270
kills the sort of the Wednesday effect
 

265
00:05:25,270 --> 00:05:27,960
kills the sort of the Wednesday effect
where it all happens on a particular day

266
00:05:27,960 --> 00:05:27,970
where it all happens on a particular day
 

267
00:05:27,970 --> 00:05:30,390
where it all happens on a particular day
at a particular moment I think if you

268
00:05:30,390 --> 00:05:30,400
at a particular moment I think if you
 

269
00:05:30,400 --> 00:05:32,100
at a particular moment I think if you
look at the stock market here you know

270
00:05:32,100 --> 00:05:32,110
look at the stock market here you know
 

271
00:05:32,110 --> 00:05:33,810
look at the stock market here you know
there's a very clear moment where you

272
00:05:33,810 --> 00:05:33,820
there's a very clear moment where you
 

273
00:05:33,820 --> 00:05:36,150
there's a very clear moment where you
can see that the market absorbs the idea

274
00:05:36,150 --> 00:05:36,160
can see that the market absorbs the idea
 

275
00:05:36,160 --> 00:05:38,970
can see that the market absorbs the idea
of the coronavirus I think that with

276
00:05:38,970 --> 00:05:38,980
of the coronavirus I think that with
 

277
00:05:38,980 --> 00:05:42,780
of the coronavirus I think that with
respect to positives the moon landing

278
00:05:42,780 --> 00:05:42,790
respect to positives the moon landing
 

279
00:05:42,790 --> 00:05:45,930
respect to positives the moon landing
was the best example of a positive that

280
00:05:45,930 --> 00:05:45,940
was the best example of a positive that
 

281
00:05:45,940 --> 00:05:49,130
was the best example of a positive that
happened at a particular time or

282
00:05:49,130 --> 00:05:49,140
happened at a particular time or
 

283
00:05:49,140 --> 00:05:52,340
happened at a particular time or
recapitulating the Soviet American

284
00:05:52,340 --> 00:05:52,350
recapitulating the Soviet American
 

285
00:05:52,350 --> 00:05:57,600
recapitulating the Soviet American
link-up in terms of Skylab and Soyuz

286
00:05:57,600 --> 00:05:57,610
link-up in terms of Skylab and Soyuz
 

287
00:05:57,610 --> 00:05:59,880
link-up in terms of Skylab and Soyuz
right like that was a huge moment when

288
00:05:59,880 --> 00:05:59,890
right like that was a huge moment when
 

289
00:05:59,890 --> 00:06:02,030
right like that was a huge moment when
you actually had these two nations

290
00:06:02,030 --> 00:06:02,040
you actually had these two nations
 

291
00:06:02,040 --> 00:06:06,330
you actually had these two nations
connecting in orbit and so yeah there

292
00:06:06,330 --> 00:06:06,340
connecting in orbit and so yeah there
 

293
00:06:06,340 --> 00:06:07,650
connecting in orbit and so yeah there
are great moments where something

294
00:06:07,650 --> 00:06:07,660
are great moments where something
 

295
00:06:07,660 --> 00:06:09,120
are great moments where something
beautiful and wonderful and amazing

296
00:06:09,120 --> 00:06:09,130
beautiful and wonderful and amazing
 

297
00:06:09,130 --> 00:06:12,300
beautiful and wonderful and amazing
happens you know but it's just they're

298
00:06:12,300 --> 00:06:12,310
happens you know but it's just they're
 

299
00:06:12,310 --> 00:06:14,610
happens you know but it's just they're
fewer that's why that's why as much as I

300
00:06:14,610 --> 00:06:14,620
fewer that's why that's why as much as I
 

301
00:06:14,620 --> 00:06:16,860
fewer that's why that's why as much as I
can't imagine proposing to somebody at a

302
00:06:16,860 --> 00:06:16,870
can't imagine proposing to somebody at a
 

303
00:06:16,870 --> 00:06:20,370
can't imagine proposing to somebody at a
sporting event when you have like 30,000

304
00:06:20,370 --> 00:06:20,380
sporting event when you have like 30,000
 

305
00:06:20,380 --> 00:06:22,500
sporting event when you have like 30,000
people waiting and you know like she

306
00:06:22,500 --> 00:06:22,510
people waiting and you know like she
 

307
00:06:22,510 --> 00:06:25,350
people waiting and you know like she
says yes that's pretty exciting

308
00:06:25,350 --> 00:06:25,360
says yes that's pretty exciting
 

309
00:06:25,360 --> 00:06:26,820
says yes that's pretty exciting
so I think that we shouldn't we

310
00:06:26,820 --> 00:06:26,830
so I think that we shouldn't we
 

311
00:06:26,830 --> 00:06:30,900
so I think that we shouldn't we
shouldn't discount that so how bad do

312
00:06:30,900 --> 00:06:30,910
shouldn't discount that so how bad do
 

313
00:06:30,910 --> 00:06:33,480
shouldn't discount that so how bad do
you think it's going to get in terms

314
00:06:33,480 --> 00:06:33,490
you think it's going to get in terms
 

315
00:06:33,490 --> 00:06:35,820
you think it's going to get in terms
of the global suffering that we're going

316
00:06:35,820 --> 00:06:35,830
of the global suffering that we're going
 

317
00:06:35,830 --> 00:06:38,550
of the global suffering that we're going
to experience with this with this crisis

318
00:06:38,550 --> 00:06:38,560
to experience with this with this crisis
 

319
00:06:38,560 --> 00:06:39,839
to experience with this with this crisis
I can't figure this one out

320
00:06:39,839 --> 00:06:39,849
I can't figure this one out
 

321
00:06:39,849 --> 00:06:41,939
I can't figure this one out
I'm just not smart enough something is

due to triage and that's a very
 

339
00:07:08,590 --> 00:07:11,189
due to triage and that's a very
terrifying story on the other hand

we've got lots of masks but they haven't

we've got lots of masks but they haven't

353
00:07:24,699 --> 00:07:27,089

stories give me the feeling that they
 

357
00:07:30,580 --> 00:07:32,909
stories give me the feeling that they
both must be true simultaneously and

both must be true simultaneously and
 

359
00:07:32,919 --> 00:07:34,740
both must be true simultaneously and
they can't both be true in any kind of

it's just that I'm dumb but I can't get
 

365

it's just that I'm dumb but I can't get
one or the other story to quiet down so

I think weirdly this is much more

serious than we had understood it and
it's not nearly as serious as some

suffering of millions of people they've

00:08:20,680 --> 00:08:24,149
suffering of millions of people they've
lost their job is this a temporary thing

lost their job is this a temporary thing

I mean what I'm my ears not to the

suffering of those people who have lost
 

409
00:08:30,190 --> 00:08:33,120

you think about that sure it's suffering

414
00:08:38,519 --> 00:08:38,529
you think about that sure it's suffering
 

415
00:08:38,529 --> 00:08:41,310
you think about that sure it's suffering
well and how that might arise itself

416
00:08:41,310 --> 00:08:41,320
well and how that might arise itself
 

417
00:08:41,320 --> 00:08:44,219
well and how that might arise itself
could be not quiet - I mean right that's

418
00:08:44,219 --> 00:08:44,229
could be not quiet - I mean right that's
 

419
00:08:44,229 --> 00:08:46,500
could be not quiet - I mean right that's
the could be a depression this could go

420
00:08:46,500 --> 00:08:46,510
the could be a depression this could go
 

421
00:08:46,510 --> 00:08:47,250
the could be a depression this could go
from recession

422
00:08:47,250 --> 00:08:47,260
from recession
 

423
00:08:47,260 --> 00:08:49,350
from recession
depression and depression could go to

424
00:08:49,350 --> 00:08:49,360
depression and depression could go to
 

425
00:08:49,360 --> 00:08:51,570
depression and depression could go to
armed conflict and then to war so it's

426
00:08:51,570 --> 00:08:51,580
armed conflict and then to war so it's
 

427
00:08:51,580 --> 00:08:56,580
armed conflict and then to war so it's
not a very abstract causal chain that

428
00:08:56,580 --> 00:08:56,590
not a very abstract causal chain that
 

429
00:08:56,590 --> 00:08:59,070
not a very abstract causal chain that
gets us to the point where we can begin

430
00:08:59,070 --> 00:08:59,080
gets us to the point where we can begin
 

431
00:08:59,080 --> 00:09:01,950
gets us to the point where we can begin
with quiet suffering and an anxiety and

00:09:01,950 --> 00:09:01,960
with quiet suffering and an anxiety and
 

433
00:09:01,960 --> 00:09:03,570
with quiet suffering and an anxiety and
all of these sorts of things and people

all of these sorts of things and people

well go retrain get another one I think

488
00:10:18,330 --> 00:10:18,340
well go retrain get another one I think
 

489
00:10:18,340 --> 00:10:20,610
well go retrain get another one I think
there's gonna be a lot less appetite for

490
00:10:20,610 --> 00:10:20,620
there's gonna be a lot less appetite for
 

491
00:10:20,620 --> 00:10:23,280
there's gonna be a lot less appetite for
that because we've been asked to

492
00:10:23,280 --> 00:10:23,290
that because we've been asked to
 

493
00:10:23,290 --> 00:10:25,620
that because we've been asked to
sacrifice to risk to act collectively

494
00:10:25,620 --> 00:10:25,630
sacrifice to risk to act collectively
 

495
00:10:25,630 --> 00:10:28,320
sacrifice to risk to act collectively
and that's the interesting thing

496
00:10:28,320 --> 00:10:28,330
and that's the interesting thing
 

497
00:10:28,330 --> 00:10:30,510
and that's the interesting thing
what does that really can in us maybe

498
00:10:30,510 --> 00:10:30,520
what does that really can in us maybe
 

499
00:10:30,520 --> 00:10:32,790
what does that really can in us maybe
the idea that we actually are Nations

500
00:10:32,790 --> 00:10:32,800
the idea that we actually are Nations
 

501

the idea that we actually are Nations
and then you know your fellow countrymen

502
00:10:35,550 --> 00:10:35,560

people certainly mean something to
 

507
00:10:39,610 --> 00:10:42,180
people certainly mean something to
people in the military but I wonder how

508
00:10:42,180 --> 00:10:42,190
people in the military but I wonder how
 

509
00:10:42,190 --> 00:10:44,010
people in the military but I wonder how
many people who aren't in the military

510
00:10:44,010 --> 00:10:44,020
many people who aren't in the military
 

511
00:10:44,020 --> 00:10:45,960
many people who aren't in the military
start to think about this it's like oh

512
00:10:45,960 --> 00:10:45,970
start to think about this it's like oh
 

513
00:10:45,970 --> 00:10:47,970
start to think about this it's like oh
yeah we are kind of running separate

514
00:10:47,970 --> 00:10:47,980
yeah we are kind of running separate
 

515
00:10:47,980 --> 00:10:51,960
yeah we are kind of running separate
experiments and we are not china so you

516
00:10:51,960 --> 00:10:51,970
experiments and we are not china so you
 

517
00:10:51,970 --> 00:10:53,370
experiments and we are not china so you
think this is kind of a period that

518
00:10:53,370 --> 00:10:53,380
think this is kind of a period that
 

519
00:10:53,380 --> 00:10:55,800
think this is kind of a period that
might be studied for years to come from

520
00:10:55,800 --> 00:10:55,810
might be studied for years to come from
 

521
00:10:55,810 --> 00:10:58,650
might be studied for years to come from
my perspective we are a part of the

00:10:58,650 --> 00:10:58,660
my perspective we are a part of the

experi
 

525
00:10:59,020 --> 00:11:01,560
experi
but I don't feel like we have access to

526
00:11:01,560 --> 00:11:01,570
but I don't feel like we have access to
 

527
00:11:01,570 --> 00:11:04,290
but I don't feel like we have access to
the full data the full data of the

528
00:11:04,290 --> 00:11:04,300
the full data the full data of the
 

529
00:11:04,300 --> 00:11:05,790
the full data the full data of the

530
00:11:05,790 --> 00:11:05,800
experiment we're just like little mice
 

531
00:11:05,800 --> 00:11:09,269

as itself once the numbness wears out
 

563
00:11:54,550 --> 00:11:59,100
as itself once the numbness wears out
and especially if this lasts for many

564
00:11:59,100 --> 00:11:59,110
and especially if this lasts for many
 

565
00:11:59,110 --> 00:12:01,320
and especially if this lasts for many
months then if it's connected to the

566
00:12:01,320 --> 00:12:01,330
months then if it's connected to the
 

567
00:12:01,330 --> 00:12:03,960
months then if it's connected to the
incompetence of the CDC in the w-h-o and

incompetence of the CDC in the w-h-o and
 

569
00:12:03,970 --> 00:12:08,190
incompetence of the CDC in the w-h-o and
our government and perhaps the election

570
00:12:08,190 --> 00:12:08,200
our government and perhaps the election

our government and perhaps the election
process you know might be biggest fear

572
00:12:11,519 --> 00:12:11,529
process you know might be biggest fear
 

573
00:12:11,529 --> 00:12:12,990
process you know might be biggest fear
is that the you know elections get

574
00:12:12,990 --> 00:12:13,000
is that the you know elections get
 

575
00:12:13,000 --> 00:12:16,230
is that the you know elections get
delayed or something like that so the

576
00:12:16,230 --> 00:12:16,240
delayed or something like that so the
 

577
00:12:16,240 --> 00:12:19,290
delayed or something like that so the
the basic mechanisms of our democracy

578
00:12:19,290 --> 00:12:19,300
the basic mechanisms of our democracy
 

579
00:12:19,300 --> 00:12:24,540
the basic mechanisms of our democracy
get slowed or damaged in some way that

580
00:12:24,540 --> 00:12:24,550
get slowed or damaged in some way that
 

581
00:12:24,550 --> 00:12:26,400
get slowed or damaged in some way that
then mixes with the fear that people

582
00:12:26,400 --> 00:12:26,410
then mixes with the fear that people
 

583
00:12:26,410 --> 00:12:28,980
then mixes with the fear that people
have that turns to panic that turns to

00:12:28,980 --> 00:12:28,990
have that turns to panic that turns to
 

585
00:12:28,990 --> 00:12:31,860
have that turns to panic that turns to
anger that anger can I just play with

of that structure that you grew up
 

591
00:12:38,459 --> 00:12:41,610
of that structure that you grew up
thinking about and again you grew up in

592
00:12:41,610 --> 00:12:41,620
thinking about and again you grew up in
 

593
00:12:41,620 --> 00:12:45,449
thinking about and again you grew up in
two places right so when you were inside

594
00:12:45,449 --> 00:12:45,459
two places right so when you were inside
 

595
00:12:45,459 --> 00:12:48,600
two places right so when you were inside
the US we tend to look at all of these

596
00:12:48,600 --> 00:12:48,610
the US we tend to look at all of these
 

597
00:12:48,610 --> 00:12:51,150
the US we tend to look at all of these
things as museum pieces like how often

598
00:12:51,150 --> 00:12:51,160
things as museum pieces like how often
 

599
00:12:51,160 --> 00:12:53,870
things as museum pieces like how often

do we amend the Constitution anymore and
in some sense if you think about the

00:12:56,470 --> 00:12:59,340
in some sense if you think about the
Jewish tradition of Simchat Torah you've

604

every seven seconds well they would be
 

1539
00:33:28,100 --> 00:33:30,250
every seven seconds well they would be
functionally much dumber because they

1540
00:33:30,250 --> 00:33:30,260
functionally much dumber because they
 

1541
00:33:30,260 --> 00:33:32,110
functionally much dumber because they

couldn't continue a thought through all
 

1543
00:33:32,120 --> 00:33:34,510
couldn't continue a thought through all
the disturbance so in some sense that's

1544
00:33:34,510 --> 00:33:34,520
the disturbance so in some sense that's
 

1545
00:33:34,520 --> 00:33:36,280
the disturbance so in some sense that's

for the lab you're constitutionally
 

1591

incapable of being around the lab you
 

1593
00:34:22,250 --> 00:34:24,669

00:46:21,830 --> 00:46:23,440
the math and physics world as the
physics world was really crazy and the

physics world was really crazy and the
 

2133
00:46:23,450 --> 00:46:25,510

just very strict and kind of

just very strict and kind of
dogmatic will psychoanalyze those folks

2138
00:46:30,410 --> 00:46:30,420
dogmatic will psychoanalyze those folks
 

2139
00:46:30,420 --> 00:46:34,190
dogmatic will psychoanalyze those folks
but I really want to maybe linger on it

2140
00:46:34,190 --> 00:46:34,200
but I really want to maybe linger on it
 

2141
00:46:34,200 --> 00:46:36,170
but I really want to maybe linger on it
a little bit longer of how you feel

a little bit longer of how you feel

special moment in your life I really
 

2147
00:46:39,750 --> 00:46:41,420
special moment in your life I really
appreciate it's a great question so that

2148
00:46:41,420 --> 00:46:41,430
appreciate it's a great question so that
 

2149
00:46:41,430 --> 00:46:43,940
appreciate it's a great question so that
if we can pair off some of that others

2150
00:46:43,940 --> 00:46:43,950
if we can pair off some of that others
 

2151
00:46:43,950 --> 00:46:50,780
if we can pair off some of that others
those other issues its new being able to

00:46:50,780 --> 00:46:50,790
those other issues its new being able to
 

2153
00:46:50,790 --> 00:46:54,890
those other issues its new being able to
say what the observer's is which is my

geometric complicated beautiful
geometric view of the world that you

2176
00:47:26,420 --> 00:47:26,430
geometric view of the world that you
 

2177
00:47:26,430 --> 00:47:28,880
geometric view of the world that you
carry with you for a long time yeah did

2178
00:47:28,880 --> 00:47:28,890
carry with you for a long time yeah did
 

2179
00:47:28,890 --> 00:47:31,480
carry with you for a long time yeah did
you did you have friends that you

2180
00:47:31,480 --> 00:47:31,490
you did you have friends that you
 

2181
00:47:31,490 --> 00:47:34,910
you did you have friends that you
colleagues essentially no talk no in

2182
00:47:34,910 --> 00:47:34,920
colleagues essentially no talk no in
 

2183

fact part of these part of that some of

2184
00:47:37,069 --> 00:47:37,079
fact part of these part of that some of
 

2185
00:47:37,079 --> 00:47:40,250
fact part of these part of that some of
these stories are me coming out to my

2186
00:47:40,250 --> 00:47:40,260
these stories are me coming out to my
 

2187
00:47:40,260 --> 00:47:43,280
these stories are me coming out to my
friends and I used the phrase coming out

2188
00:47:43,280 --> 00:47:43,290
friends and I used the phrase coming out
 

2189
00:47:43,290 --> 00:47:45,289
friends and I used the phrase coming out
because I think that gays have

2190
00:47:45,289 --> 00:47:45,299
because I think that gays have
 

2191
00:47:45,299 --> 00:47:47,299
because I think that gays have
monopolized the concept of the closet

2192
00:47:47,299 --> 00:47:47,309
monopolized the concept of the closet
 

2193
00:47:47,309 --> 00:47:49,760
monopolized the concept of the closet
many of us are in closets haven't having

2194
00:47:49,760 --> 00:47:49,770
many of us are in closets haven't having
 

2195
00:47:49,770 --> 00:47:50,720
many of us are in closets haven't having
nothing to do with their sexual

2196
00:47:50,720 --> 00:47:50,730
nothing to do with their sexual
 

2197
00:47:50,730 --> 00:47:54,859
nothing to do with their sexual
orientation yeah I didn't really feel

2198
00:47:54,859 --> 00:47:54,869
orientation yeah I didn't really feel
 

2199
00:47:54,869 --> 00:47:56,780
orientation yeah I didn't really feel
comfortable talking to almost anyone so

2200
00:47:56,780 --> 00:47:56,790
comfortable talking to almost anyone so
 

2201
00:47:56,790 --> 00:48:00,500
comfortable talking to almost anyone so
this was a closely guarded secret and I

2202
00:48:00,500 --> 00:48:00,510
this was a closely guarded secret and I
 

2203
00:48:00,510 --> 00:48:02,359
this was a closely guarded secret and I
think that I let on in some ways that I

2204
00:48:02,359 --> 00:48:02,369
think that I let on in some ways that I
 

2205
00:48:02,369 --> 00:48:05,030
think that I let on in some ways that I
was up to something and probably but it

2206
00:48:05,030 --> 00:48:05,040
was up to something and probably but it
 

2207
00:48:05,040 --> 00:48:07,309
was up to something and probably but it
was a very weird life so I did write I

2208
00:48:07,309 --> 00:48:07,319
was a very weird life so I did write I
 

2209
00:48:07,319 --> 00:48:09,049
was a very weird life so I did write I
have a series of things that I pretended

2210
00:48:09,049 --> 00:48:09,059
have a series of things that I pretended
 

2211
00:48:09,059 --> 00:48:11,480
have a series of things that I pretended
to care about so that I could use that

2212
00:48:11,480 --> 00:48:11,490
to care about so that I could use that
 

2213
00:48:11,490 --> 00:48:13,430
to care about so that I could use that
as the stalking horse for what I really

2214
00:48:13,430 --> 00:48:13,440
as the stalking horse for what I really
 

2215
00:48:13,440 --> 00:48:16,069
as the stalking horse for what I really
cared about and to your point I never

2216
00:48:16,069 --> 00:48:16,079
cared about and to your point I never
 

2217
00:48:16,079 --> 00:48:17,420
cared about and to your point I never
understood this whole thing about

2218
00:48:17,420 --> 00:48:17,430
understood this whole thing about
 

2219
00:48:17,430 --> 00:48:19,730
understood this whole thing about
theories of everything like if you were

2220
00:48:19,730 --> 00:48:19,740
theories of everything like if you were
 

2221
00:48:19,740 --> 00:48:21,410
theories of everything like if you were
gonna go into something like theoretical

2222
00:48:21,410 --> 00:48:21,420
gonna go into something like theoretical
 

2223
00:48:21,420 --> 00:48:23,630
gonna go into something like theoretical
physics isn't that what you would

2224
00:48:23,630 --> 00:48:23,640
physics isn't that what you would
 

2225
00:48:23,640 --> 00:48:26,000
physics isn't that what you would
normally pursue like wouldn't it be

2226
00:48:26,000 --> 00:48:26,010
normally pursue like wouldn't it be
 

2227
00:48:26,010 --> 00:48:28,099
normally pursue like wouldn't it be
crazy to do something that difficult and

2228
00:48:28,099 --> 00:48:28,109
crazy to do something that difficult and
 

2229
00:48:28,109 --> 00:48:30,799
crazy to do something that difficult and
that poorly paid if you we're gonna try

2230
00:48:30,799 --> 00:48:30,809
that poorly paid if you we're gonna try
 

2231
00:48:30,809 --> 00:48:32,329
that poorly paid if you we're gonna try
to do something other than figure out

2232
00:48:32,329 --> 00:48:32,339
to do something other than figure out
 

2233
00:48:32,339 --> 00:48:34,730
to do something other than figure out
what this is all about now I have to

2234
00:48:34,730 --> 00:48:34,740
what this is all about now I have to
 

2235
00:48:34,740 --> 00:48:38,030
what this is all about now I have to
reveal my cards my weaknesses and lack

2236
00:48:38,030 --> 00:48:38,040
reveal my cards my weaknesses and lack
 

2237
00:48:38,040 --> 00:48:41,070
reveal my cards my weaknesses and lack

and math departments but there's an

2240
00:48:43,620 --> 00:48:43,630
and math departments but there's an
 

2241
00:48:43,630 --> 00:48:44,970
and math departments but there's an
analogy here to artificial intelligence

00:48:44,970 --> 00:48:44,980
analogy here to artificial intelligence
 

2243
00:48:44,980 --> 00:48:50,880
analogy here to artificial intelligence
and often folks come in and say okay so

2244
00:48:50,880 --> 00:48:50,890
and often folks come in and say okay so
 

2245
00:48:50,890 --> 00:48:53,340
and often folks come in and say okay so
there's a giant department working on

2246
00:48:53,340 --> 00:48:53,350
there's a giant department working on
 

2247
00:48:53,350 --> 00:48:55,080
there's a giant department working on
quote-unquote artificial intelligence

quote-unquote artificial intelligence
 

2249
00:48:55,090 --> 00:48:58,730
quote-unquote artificial intelligence
but why is nobody actually working on

2250
00:48:58,730 --> 00:48:58,740
but why is nobody actually working on
 

2251
00:48:58,740 --> 00:49:01,830
but why is nobody actually working on
intelligence like it you're all just

2252
00:49:01,830 --> 00:49:01,840
intelligence like it you're all just
 

2253
00:49:01,840 --> 00:49:04,860
intelligence like it you're all just
building little toys right you're not

00:49:04,860 --> 00:49:04,870
building little toys right you're not
 

2255
00:49:04,870 --> 00:49:06,720
building little toys right you're not
actually trying to understand and that

2256
00:49:06,720 --> 00:49:06,730
actually trying to understand and that
 

2257
00:49:06,730 --> 00:49:10,320
actually trying to understand and that
breaks a lot of people and that they it

2258
00:49:10,320 --> 00:49:10,330
breaks a lot of people and that they it
 

2259
00:49:10,330 --> 00:49:12,780
breaks a lot of people and that they it
confuses them it's like okay so I'm at

2260
00:49:12,780 --> 00:49:12,790
confuses them it's like okay so I'm at
 

2261
00:49:12,790 --> 00:49:15,990
confuses them it's like okay so I'm at
MIT I'm at Stanford I'm at Harvard I'm

2262
00:49:15,990 --> 00:49:16,000
MIT I'm at Stanford I'm at Harvard I'm
 

2263
00:49:16,000 --> 00:49:18,000
MIT I'm at Stanford I'm at Harvard I'm
here I dreamed of being what kind of

2264
00:49:18,000 --> 00:49:18,010
here I dreamed of being what kind of
 

2265
00:49:18,010 --> 00:49:20,820
here I dreamed of being what kind of
artificial intelligence why is everybody

2266
00:49:20,820 --> 00:49:20,830
artificial intelligence why is everybody
 

2267
00:49:20,830 --> 00:49:23,310
artificial intelligence why is everybody
not actually working on intelligence and

2268
00:49:23,310 --> 00:49:23,320
not actually working on intelligence and
 

2269
00:49:23,320 --> 00:49:25,770
not actually working on intelligence and
I have the same kind of sense that

2270
00:49:25,770 --> 00:49:25,780
I have the same kind of sense that
 

2271
00:49:25,780 --> 00:49:27,240
I have the same kind of sense that
that's what working on the theory of

2272
00:49:27,240 --> 00:49:27,250
that's what working on the theory of
 

2273
00:49:27,250 --> 00:49:30,390
that's what working on the theory of
everything is that's strangely you

2274
00:49:30,390 --> 00:49:30,400
everything is that's strangely you
 

2275
00:49:30,400 --> 00:49:33,180
everything is that's strangely you
somehow become an outcast for even but

2276
00:49:33,180 --> 00:49:33,190
somehow become an outcast for even but
 

2277
00:49:33,190 --> 00:49:36,900
somehow become an outcast for even but
we know why this is right why well it's

2278
00:49:36,900 --> 00:49:36,910
we know why this is right why well it's
 

2279
00:49:36,910 --> 00:49:38,880
we know why this is right why well it's
because let's take the artificial it's

2280
00:49:38,880 --> 00:49:38,890
because let's take the artificial it's
 

2281
00:49:38,890 --> 00:49:41,370
because let's take the artificial it's
play with a GI for example yeah I think

2282
00:49:41,370 --> 00:49:41,380
play with a GI for example yeah I think
 

2283
00:49:41,380 --> 00:49:44,310
play with a GI for example yeah I think
that the idea starts off with nobody

2284
00:49:44,310 --> 00:49:44,320
that the idea starts off with nobody
 

2285
00:49:44,320 --> 00:49:46,080
that the idea starts off with nobody
really knows how to work on that and so

2286
00:49:46,080 --> 00:49:46,090
really knows how to work on that and so
 

2287
00:49:46,090 --> 00:49:48,360
really knows how to work on that and so
if we don't know how to work on it we

2288
00:49:48,360 --> 00:49:48,370
if we don't know how to work on it we
 

2289
00:49:48,370 --> 00:49:50,790
if we don't know how to work on it we
choose instead to work on a program that

2290
00:49:50,790 --> 00:49:50,800
choose instead to work on a program that
 

2291
00:49:50,800 --> 00:49:53,250
choose instead to work on a program that
is tangentially related to it so we do a

2292
00:49:53,250 --> 00:49:53,260
is tangentially related to it so we do a
 

2293
00:49:53,260 --> 00:49:55,770
is tangentially related to it so we do a
component of a program that is related

2294
00:49:55,770 --> 00:49:55,780
component of a program that is related
 

2295
00:49:55,780 --> 00:49:58,470
component of a program that is related
to that big question because it's felt

2296
00:49:58,470 --> 00:49:58,480
to that big question because it's felt
 

2297
00:49:58,480 --> 00:50:00,630
to that big question because it's felt
like at least I can make progress there

2298
00:50:00,630 --> 00:50:00,640
like at least I can make progress there
 

2299
00:50:00,640 --> 00:50:04,320
like at least I can make progress there
and that wasn't where I was where I was

2300
00:50:04,320 --> 00:50:04,330
and that wasn't where I was where I was
 

2301
00:50:04,330 --> 00:50:07,650
and that wasn't where I was where I was
in it's funny there was this book of

2302
00:50:07,650 --> 00:50:07,660
in it's funny there was this book of
 

2303
00:50:07,660 --> 00:50:09,810
in it's funny there was this book of
called Friedan uhlan beck and it had

2304
00:50:09,810 --> 00:50:09,820
called Friedan uhlan beck and it had
 

2305
00:50:09,820 --> 00:50:11,790
called Friedan uhlan beck and it had
this weird mysterious line in the

2306
00:50:11,790 --> 00:50:11,800
this weird mysterious line in the
 

2307
00:50:11,800 --> 00:50:14,820
this weird mysterious line in the
beginning of it and I tried to get

2308
00:50:14,820 --> 00:50:14,830
beginning of it and I tried to get
 

2309
00:50:14,830 --> 00:50:16,230
beginning of it and I tried to get
clarification of this weird mysterious

2310
00:50:16,230 --> 00:50:16,240
clarification of this weird mysterious
 

2311
00:50:16,240 --> 00:50:19,560
clarification of this weird mysterious
line and everyone said wrong things and

2312
00:50:19,560 --> 00:50:19,570
line and everyone said wrong things and
 

2313
00:50:19,570 --> 00:50:21,210
line and everyone said wrong things and
then I said okay well so I can tell that

2314
00:50:21,210 --> 00:50:21,220
then I said okay well so I can tell that
 

2315
00:50:21,220 --> 00:50:23,430
then I said okay well so I can tell that
nobody's thinking properly because I

2316
00:50:23,430 --> 00:50:23,440
nobody's thinking properly because I
 

2317
00:50:23,440 --> 00:50:25,490
nobody's thinking properly because I
just asked the entire department and

2318
00:50:25,490 --> 00:50:25,500
just asked the entire department and
 

2319
00:50:25,500 --> 00:50:28,140
just asked the entire department and
nobody has a correct interpretation of

2320
00:50:28,140 --> 00:50:28,150
nobody has a correct interpretation of
 

2321
00:50:28,150 --> 00:50:30,990
nobody has a correct interpretation of
this and so you know it's a little bit

2322
00:50:30,990 --> 00:50:31,000
this and so you know it's a little bit
 

2323
00:50:31,000 --> 00:50:34,950
this and so you know it's a little bit
like you see a crime-scene photo and you

2324
00:50:34,950 --> 00:50:34,960
like you see a crime-scene photo and you
 

2325
00:50:34,960 --> 00:50:36,420
like you see a crime-scene photo and you
have a different idea like there's a

2326
00:50:36,420 --> 00:50:36,430
have a different idea like there's a
 

2327
00:50:36,430 --> 00:50:38,280
have a different idea like there's a
smoking gun and you figure that's

2328
00:50:38,280 --> 00:50:38,290

two separate issues one is the issue of

two separate issues one is the issue of
 

2495
00:54:12,700 --> 00:54:15,730
two separate issues one is the issue of
making sure that the idea is actually

2496
00:54:15,730 --> 00:54:15,740
making sure that the idea is actually
 

2497
00:54:15,740 --> 00:54:18,819
making sure that the idea is actually
heard and explored and the other is the

heard and explored and the other is the
 

2499
00:54:18,829 --> 00:54:21,039

is the question about will I become

00:54:21,039 --> 00:54:21,049
is the question about will I become
 

2501
00:54:21,049 --> 00:54:24,849
is the question about will I become
disconnected from my work because it

00:54:24,849 --> 00:54:24,859
disconnected from my work because it
 

2503
00:54:24,859 --> 00:54:26,920
disconnected from my work because it
will be ridiculed it will it will be

00:54:26,920 --> 00:54:26,930
will be ridiculed it will it will be
 

2505
00:54:26,930 --> 00:54:28,990

does not want you to gain a voice it's a

does not want you to gain a voice it's a
 

2513
00:54:37,339 --> 00:54:39,460
does not want you to gain a voice it's a
little bit like a policeman deciding to

00:54:39,460 --> 00:54:39,470
little bit like a policeman deciding to
 

2515
00:54:39,470 --> 00:54:42,329
little bit like a policeman deciding to
weirdly and enforce all of these

2516
00:54:42,329 --> 00:54:42,339
weirdly and enforce all of these
 

2517
00:54:42,339 --> 00:54:46,750
weirdly and enforce all of these
little-known regulations against you and

2518
00:54:46,750 --> 00:54:46,760
little-known regulations against you and
 

2519
00:54:46,760 --> 00:54:49,059
little-known regulations against you and
you know sometimes nobody else and I

2520
00:54:49,059 --> 00:54:49,069
you know sometimes nobody else and I
 

2521
00:54:49,069 --> 00:54:51,809
you know sometimes nobody else and I
think that's kind of you know this weird

2522
00:54:51,809 --> 00:54:51,819
think that's kind of you know this weird
 

2523
00:54:51,819 --> 00:54:56,950
think that's kind of you know this weird
thing where I just don't believe that we

2524
00:54:56,950 --> 00:54:56,960
thing where I just don't believe that we
 

2525
00:54:56,960 --> 00:55:00,400
thing where I just don't believe that we
can reach the final theory necessarily

2526
00:55:00,400 --> 00:55:00,410
can reach the final theory necessarily
 

2527
00:55:00,410 --> 00:55:02,319
can reach the final theory necessarily
within the political economy of

2528
00:55:02,319 --> 00:55:02,329
within the political economy of
 

2529
00:55:02,329 --> 00:55:04,660
within the political economy of
academics so if you think about how

2530
00:55:04,660 --> 00:55:04,670
academics so if you think about how
 

2531
00:55:04,670 --> 00:55:07,260
academics so if you think about how
academics are tortured by each other and

2532
00:55:07,260 --> 00:55:07,270
academics are tortured by each other and
 

2533
00:55:07,270 --> 00:55:10,030
academics are tortured by each other and
have their paid and where they have

2534
00:55:10,030 --> 00:55:10,040
have their paid and where they have
 

2535
00:55:10,040 --> 00:55:11,200
have their paid and where they have
freedom and where they don't

2536
00:55:11,200 --> 00:55:11,210
freedom and where they don't
 

2537
00:55:11,210 --> 00:55:13,180
freedom and where they don't
I actually weirdly think that that

2538
00:55:13,180 --> 00:55:13,190
I actually weirdly think that that
 

2539
00:55:13,190 --> 00:55:15,220
I actually weirdly think that that
system of selective pressures is going

2540
00:55:15,220 --> 00:55:15,230
system of selective pressures is going
 

2541
00:55:15,230 --> 00:55:17,200
system of selective pressures is going
to eliminate anybody who's going to make

2542
00:55:17,200 --> 00:55:17,210
to eliminate anybody who's going to make
 

2543
00:55:17,210 --> 00:55:19,210
to eliminate anybody who's going to make
real progress so that's interesting so

2544
00:55:19,210 --> 00:55:19,220
real progress so that's interesting so
 

2545
00:55:19,220 --> 00:55:20,589
real progress so that's interesting so
if you look at

2546
00:55:20,589 --> 00:55:20,599
if you look at
 

2547
00:55:20,599 --> 00:55:22,390
if you look at
the story of Andrew Wiles for example

2548
00:55:22,390 --> 00:55:22,400
the story of Andrew Wiles for example
 

2549
00:55:22,400 --> 00:55:26,919
the story of Andrew Wiles for example
with from last Last Theorem he as far as

00:55:26,919 --> 00:55:26,929
with from last Last Theorem he as far as
 

2551
00:55:26,929 --> 00:55:29,469
with from last Last Theorem he as far as
I understand he pretty much isolated

2552
00:55:29,469 --> 00:55:29,479
I understand he pretty much isolated
 

2553
00:55:29,479 --> 00:55:32,049
I understand he pretty much isolated
himself from the world of academics in

2554
00:55:32,049 --> 00:55:32,059
himself from the world of academics in
 

2555
00:55:32,059 --> 00:55:33,909
himself from the world of academics in
terms of the big with the bulk of the

00:55:33,909 --> 00:55:33,919
terms of the big with the bulk of the
 

2557
00:55:33,919 --> 00:55:36,789
terms of the big with the bulk of the
work he did and it from my perspective

2558
00:55:36,789 --> 00:55:36,799
work he did and it from my perspective
 

2559
00:55:36,799 --> 00:55:40,179
work he did and it from my perspective
is dramatic and fun to read about but it

2560
00:55:40,179 --> 00:55:40,189
is dramatic and fun to read about but it
 

2561
00:55:40,189 --> 00:55:41,859
is dramatic and fun to read about but it
seemed exceptionally stressful the first

2562
00:55:41,859 --> 00:55:41,869
seemed exceptionally stressful the first
 

2563
00:55:41,869 --> 00:55:43,959
seemed exceptionally stressful the first
step he took the first steps he took

2564
00:55:43,959 --> 00:55:43,969
step he took the first steps he took
 

2565
00:55:43,969 --> 00:55:45,789
step he took the first steps he took
when actually making the work public

2566
00:55:45,789 --> 00:55:45,799
when actually making the work public
 

2567
00:55:45,799 --> 00:55:48,939
when actually making the work public
that's him to me would be hell now but

2568
00:55:48,939 --> 00:55:48,949
that's him to me would be hell now but
 

2569
00:55:48,949 --> 00:55:51,640
that's him to me would be hell now but
it's like so artificially dramatic you

2570
00:55:51,640 --> 00:55:51,650
it's like so artificially dramatic you
 

2571
00:55:51,650 --> 00:55:53,919
it's like so artificially dramatic you
know he leads up to it at a series of

2572
00:55:53,919 --> 00:55:53,929
know he leads up to it at a series of
 

2573
00:55:53,929 --> 00:55:57,880
know he leads up to it at a series of
lectures he doesn't want to say it and

2574
00:55:57,880 --> 00:55:57,890
lectures he doesn't want to say it and
 

2575
00:55:57,890 --> 00:55:59,469
lectures he doesn't want to say it and
then he finally says it at the end

2576
00:55:59,469 --> 00:55:59,479
then he finally says it at the end
 

2577
00:55:59,479 --> 00:56:01,089
then he finally says it at the end
because obviously this comes out of a

2578
00:56:01,089 --> 00:56:01,099
because obviously this comes out of a
 

2579
00:56:01,099 --> 00:56:03,640
because obviously this comes out of a
body of work where I mean the funny part

2580
00:56:03,640 --> 00:56:03,650
body of work where I mean the funny part
 

2581
00:56:03,650 --> 00:56:05,319
body of work where I mean the funny part
about for Moz le'ts theorem is that

2582
00:56:05,319 --> 00:56:05,329
about for Moz le'ts theorem is that
 

2583
00:56:05,329 --> 00:56:07,299
about for Moz le'ts theorem is that
wasn't originally thought to be a deep

2584
00:56:07,299 --> 00:56:07,309
wasn't originally thought to be a deep
 

2585
00:56:07,309 --> 00:56:09,579
wasn't originally thought to be a deep
and meaningful problem it was just an

2586
00:56:09,579 --> 00:56:09,589
and meaningful problem it was just an
 

2587
00:56:09,589 --> 00:56:11,640
and meaningful problem it was just an
easy to state one that had gone unsolved

2588
00:56:11,640 --> 00:56:11,650
easy to state one that had gone unsolved
 

2589
00:56:11,650 --> 00:56:14,529
easy to state one that had gone unsolved
but if you think about it it became

2590
00:56:14,529 --> 00:56:14,539
but if you think about it it became
 

2591
00:56:14,539 --> 00:56:16,900
but if you think about it it became
attached to the body of regular theory

2592
00:56:16,900 --> 00:56:16,910
attached to the body of regular theory
 

2593
00:56:16,910 --> 00:56:19,150
attached to the body of regular theory
so he built up this body of regular

2594
00:56:19,150 --> 00:56:19,160
so he built up this body of regular
 

2595
00:56:19,160 --> 00:56:21,039
so he built up this body of regular
theory gets all the way up to the end

2596
00:56:21,039 --> 00:56:21,049
theory gets all the way up to the end
 

2597
00:56:21,049 --> 00:56:24,009
theory gets all the way up to the end
announces and then like there's this

2598
00:56:24,009 --> 00:56:24,019
announces and then like there's this
 

2599
00:56:24,019 --> 00:56:26,109
announces and then like there's this
whole drama about okay somebody's

2600
00:56:26,109 --> 00:56:26,119
whole drama about okay somebody's
 

2601
00:56:26,119 --> 00:56:27,640
whole drama about okay somebody's
checking the proof I don't understand

2602
00:56:27,640 --> 00:56:27,650
checking the proof I don't understand
 

2603
00:56:27,650 --> 00:56:30,429
checking the proof I don't understand
what's going on on line 37 you know and

2604
00:56:30,429 --> 00:56:30,439
what's going on on line 37 you know and
 

2605
00:56:30,439 --> 00:56:32,079
what's going on on line 37 you know and
like oh is this serious seems a little

2606
00:56:32,079 --> 00:56:32,089
like oh is this serious seems a little
 

2607
00:56:32,089 --> 00:56:33,880
like oh is this serious seems a little
bit more serious than we knew I mean do

2608
00:56:33,880 --> 00:56:33,890
bit more serious than we knew I mean do
 

2609
00:56:33,890 --> 00:56:35,829
bit more serious than we knew I mean do
you see parallels you share the concern

2610
00:56:35,829 --> 00:56:35,839
you see parallels you share the concern
 

2611
00:56:35,839 --> 00:56:37,299
you see parallels you share the concern
that the year your experience might be

2612
00:56:37,299 --> 00:56:37,309
that the year your experience might be
 

2613
00:56:37,309 --> 00:56:39,189
that the year your experience might be
something similar well in his case I

2614
00:56:39,189 --> 00:56:39,199
something similar well in his case I
 

2615
00:56:39,199 --> 00:56:41,019
something similar well in his case I
think that if I recall correctly his

2616
00:56:41,019 --> 00:56:41,029
think that if I recall correctly his
 

2617
00:56:41,029 --> 00:56:43,870
think that if I recall correctly his
original proof was unsalvageable he

2618
00:56:43,870 --> 00:56:43,880
original proof was unsalvageable he
 

2619
00:56:43,880 --> 00:56:46,439
original proof was unsalvageable he
actually came up with a second proof

2620
00:56:46,439 --> 00:56:46,449
actually came up with a second proof
 

2621
00:56:46,449 --> 00:56:51,699
actually came up with a second proof
with a colleague Richard Taylor and it

2622
00:56:51,699 --> 00:56:51,709
with a colleague Richard Taylor and it
 

2623
00:56:51,709 --> 00:56:53,589
with a colleague Richard Taylor and it
was that second proof which carried the

2624
00:56:53,589 --> 00:56:53,599
was that second proof which carried the
 

2625
00:56:53,599 --> 00:56:55,120
was that second proof which carried the
day so it was a little bit that he got

2626
00:56:55,120 --> 00:56:55,130
day so it was a little bit that he got
 

2627
00:56:55,130 --> 00:56:57,640
day so it was a little bit that he got
put under incredible pressure and then

2628
00:56:57,640 --> 00:56:57,650
put under incredible pressure and then
 

2629
00:56:57,650 --> 00:57:00,039
put under incredible pressure and then
had to succeed in a new way having

2630
00:57:00,039 --> 00:57:00,049
had to succeed in a new way having
 

2631
00:57:00,049 --> 00:57:02,140
had to succeed in a new way having
failed the first time which is like even

2632
00:57:02,140 --> 00:57:02,150
failed the first time which is like even
 

2633
00:57:02,150 --> 00:57:03,759
failed the first time which is like even
a weirder and stranger store has an

a weirder and stranger store has an
 

2635
00:57:03,769 --> 00:57:05,829
a weirder and stranger store has an
incredible story in some sense but I

2636
00:57:05,829 --> 00:57:05,839
incredible story in some sense but I
 

2637
00:57:05,839 --> 00:57:08,679
incredible story in some sense but I

okay let's imagine for example that you
 

2729
00:59:10,350 --> 00:59:13,610
okay let's imagine for example that you
have a story where you believe that

right and now somebody introduces a new

2740
00:59:25,670 --> 00:59:25,680
right and now somebody introduces a new
 

2741
00:59:25,680 --> 00:59:27,590
right and now somebody introduces a new
idea to you which is like what if it

2742
00:59:27,590 --> 00:59:27,600
idea to you which is like what if it
 

2743
00:59:27,600 --> 00:59:28,580
idea to you which is like what if it
isn't stress at all

well when Dirac in 1963

2760
00:59:48,670 --> 00:59:48,680
well when Dirac in 1963
 

2761
00:59:48,680 --> 00:59:51,350
well when Dirac in 1963
talked about the importance of beauty as

00:59:51,350 --> 00:59:51,360
talked about the importance of beauty as
 

2763
00:59:51,360 --> 00:59:54,260
talked about the importance of beauty as
a guiding principle in physics and he

2764
00:59:54,260 --> 00:59:54,270
a guiding principle in physics and he
 

2765
00:59:54,270 --> 00:59:55,370
a guiding principle in physics and he
wasn't talking about the scientific

wasn't talking about the scientific
 

2767
00:59:55,380 --> 00:59:59,390
wasn't talking about the scientific
method that was crazy talk but he was

00:59:59,390 --> 00:59:59,400
method that was crazy talk but he was
 

2769
00:59:59,400 --> 01:00:01,130
method that was crazy talk but he was
actually making a great point and he was

2770
01:00:01,130 --> 01:00:01,140
actually making a great point and he was
 

2771
01:00:01,140 --> 01:00:02,900
actually making a great point and he was
using Schrodinger and I think it was

2772
01:00:02,900 --> 01:00:02,910
using Schrodinger and I think it was
 

2773
01:00:02,910 --> 01:00:05,330
using Schrodinger and I think it was
Schrodinger was standing in for him and

2774
01:00:05,330 --> 01:00:05,340
Schrodinger was standing in for him and
 

2775
01:00:05,340 --> 01:00:07,070
Schrodinger was standing in for him and
he said that if your equations don't

2776
01:00:07,070 --> 01:00:07,080
he said that if your equations don't
 

2777
01:00:07,080 --> 01:00:09,260
he said that if your equations don't
agree with experiment that's kind of a

2778
01:00:09,260 --> 01:00:09,270
agree with experiment that's kind of a
 

2779
01:00:09,270 --> 01:00:11,540
agree with experiment that's kind of a
minor detail if they have true beauty in

2780
01:00:11,540 --> 01:00:11,550
minor detail if they have true beauty in
 

2781
01:00:11,550 --> 01:00:13,820
minor detail if they have true beauty in
them you should explore them because

2782
01:00:13,820 --> 01:00:13,830
them you should explore them because
 

2783
01:00:13,830 --> 01:00:16,670
them you should explore them because
very often the agreement with experiment

2784
01:00:16,670 --> 01:00:16,680
very often the agreement with experiment
 

2785
01:00:16,680 --> 01:00:19,340
very often the agreement with experiment
is that it's an issue of fine tuning of

2786
01:00:19,340 --> 01:00:19,350
is that it's an issue of fine tuning of
 

2787
01:00:19,350 --> 01:00:21,140
is that it's an issue of fine tuning of
your model of the instantiation

2788
01:00:21,140 --> 01:00:21,150
your model of the instantiation
 

2789
01:00:21,150 --> 01:00:23,810
your model of the instantiation
and so it doesn't really tell you that

2790
01:00:23,810 --> 01:00:23,820
and so it doesn't really tell you that
 

2791
01:00:23,820 --> 01:00:25,910
and so it doesn't really tell you that
your model is wrong and of course

2792
01:00:25,910 --> 01:00:25,920
your model is wrong and of course
 

2793
01:00:25,920 --> 01:00:27,920
your model is wrong and of course
Heisenberg told Dirac that his model was

2794
01:00:27,920 --> 01:00:27,930
Heisenberg told Dirac that his model was
 

2795
01:00:27,930 --> 01:00:31,280
Heisenberg told Dirac that his model was
wrong because that the proton and the

2796
01:00:31,280 --> 01:00:31,290
wrong because that the proton and the
 

2797
01:00:31,290 --> 01:00:33,020
wrong because that the proton and the
electron should be the same mass if they

2798
01:00:33,020 --> 01:00:33,030
electron should be the same mass if they
 

2799
01:00:33,030 --> 01:00:35,750
electron should be the same mass if they
are each other's antiparticles and that

2800
01:00:35,750 --> 01:00:35,760
are each other's antiparticles and that
 

2801
01:00:35,760 --> 01:00:38,830
are each other's antiparticles and that
was a an irrelevant kind of silliness

2802
01:00:38,830 --> 01:00:38,840
was a an irrelevant kind of silliness
 

2803
01:00:38,840 --> 01:00:42,170
was a an irrelevant kind of silliness
rather than a real threat to the Dirac

2804
01:00:42,170 --> 01:00:42,180
rather than a real threat to the Dirac
 

2805
01:00:42,180 --> 01:00:44,750
rather than a real threat to the Dirac
theory but okay so I'm amidst all this

2806
01:00:44,750 --> 01:00:44,760
theory but okay so I'm amidst all this
 

2807
01:00:44,760 --> 01:00:47,600
theory but okay so I'm amidst all this
silliness hmm I'm hoping that we could

2808
01:00:47,600 --> 01:00:47,610
silliness hmm I'm hoping that we could
 

2809
01:00:47,610 --> 01:00:50,000
silliness hmm I'm hoping that we could
talk about the journey that geometric

2810
01:00:50,000 --> 01:00:50,010
talk about the journey that geometric
 

2811
01:00:50,010 --> 01:00:53,300
talk about the journey that geometric
unity has taken and will take as an idea

2812
01:00:53,300 --> 01:00:53,310
unity has taken and will take as an idea
 

2813
01:00:53,310 --> 01:00:56,180
unity has taken and will take as an idea
and an idea that will see the light yeah

2814
01:00:56,180 --> 01:00:56,190
and an idea that will see the light yeah
 

2815
01:00:56,190 --> 01:00:59,960
and an idea that will see the light yeah
that so first of all let's I'm thinking

2816
01:00:59,960 --> 01:00:59,970
that so first of all let's I'm thinking
 

2817
01:00:59,970 --> 01:01:02,210
that so first of all let's I'm thinking
of writing a book called geometric unity

2818
01:01:02,210 --> 01:01:02,220
of writing a book called geometric unity
 

2819
01:01:02,220 --> 01:01:04,730
of writing a book called geometric unity
for idiots okay and I need you as a

2820
01:01:04,730 --> 01:01:04,740
for idiots okay and I need you as a
 

2821
01:01:04,740 --> 01:01:05,600
for idiots okay and I need you as a
consultant

2822
01:01:05,600 --> 01:01:05,610
consultant
 

2823
01:01:05,610 --> 01:01:07,730
consultant
so can we first of all I hope I have the

2824
01:01:07,730 --> 01:01:07,740
so can we first of all I hope I have the
 

2825
01:01:07,740 --> 01:01:10,280
so can we first of all I hope I have the
trademark on geometric units you do good

2826
01:01:10,280 --> 01:01:10,290
trademark on geometric units you do good
 

2827
01:01:10,290 --> 01:01:14,570
trademark on geometric units you do good
can you give a basic introduction of the

2828
01:01:14,570 --> 01:01:14,580
can you give a basic introduction of the
 

2829
01:01:14,580 --> 01:01:18,380
can you give a basic introduction of the
goals of geometric unity the basic tools

2830
01:01:18,380 --> 01:01:18,390
goals of geometric unity the basic tools
 

2831
01:01:18,390 --> 01:01:22,220
goals of geometric unity the basic tools
of mathematics use the viewpoints in

2832
01:01:22,220 --> 01:01:22,230
of mathematics use the viewpoints in
 

2833
01:01:22,230 --> 01:01:25,460
of mathematics use the viewpoints in
general for idiots Sharik me okay great

2834
01:01:25,460 --> 01:01:25,470
general for idiots Sharik me okay great
 

2835
01:01:25,470 --> 01:01:27,890
general for idiots Sharik me okay great
fun so what's the goal of geometric

2836
01:01:27,890 --> 01:01:27,900
fun so what's the goal of geometric
 

2837
01:01:27,900 --> 01:01:30,680
fun so what's the goal of geometric
unity the goal of geometric unity is to

2838
01:01:30,680 --> 01:01:30,690
unity the goal of geometric unity is to
 

2839
01:01:30,690 --> 01:01:34,240
unity the goal of geometric unity is to
start with something so completely bland

2840
01:01:34,240 --> 01:01:34,250
start with something so completely bland
 

2841
01:01:34,250 --> 01:01:37,850
start with something so completely bland
that you can simply say well that's a

2842
01:01:37,850 --> 01:01:37,860
that you can simply say well that's a
 

2843
01:01:37,860 --> 01:01:39,860
that you can simply say well that's a
something that begins the game is as

2844
01:01:39,860 --> 01:01:39,870
something that begins the game is as
 

2845
01:01:39,870 --> 01:01:41,900
something that begins the game is as
close to a mathematical nothing as

2846
01:01:41,900 --> 01:01:41,910
close to a mathematical nothing as
 

2847
01:01:41,910 --> 01:01:43,820
close to a mathematical nothing as
possible in other words I can't answer

2848
01:01:43,820 --> 01:01:43,830
possible in other words I can't answer
 

2849
01:01:43,830 --> 01:01:45,230
possible in other words I can't answer
the question why is there something

2850
01:01:45,230 --> 01:01:45,240
the question why is there something
 

2851
01:01:45,240 --> 01:01:46,670
the question why is there something
rather than nothing but if there has to

2852
01:01:46,670 --> 01:01:46,680
rather than nothing but if there has to
 

2853
01:01:46,680 --> 01:01:49,520
rather than nothing but if there has to
be a something that we begin from let it

2854
01:01:49,520 --> 01:01:49,530
be a something that we begin from let it
 

2855
01:01:49,530 --> 01:01:51,350
be a something that we begin from let it
begin from something that's like a blank

2856
01:01:51,350 --> 01:01:51,360
begin from something that's like a blank
 

2857
01:01:51,360 --> 01:01:56,150
begin from something that's like a blank
canvas that's even more basic so what is

2858
01:01:56,150 --> 01:01:56,160
canvas that's even more basic so what is
 

2859
01:01:56,160 --> 01:01:57,860
canvas that's even more basic so what is
something what are we trying to describe

2860
01:01:57,860 --> 01:01:57,870
something what are we trying to describe
 

2861
01:01:57,870 --> 01:02:01,050
something what are we trying to describe
okay right now we have

2862
01:02:01,050 --> 01:02:01,060
okay right now we have
 

2863
01:02:01,060 --> 01:02:04,110
okay right now we have
a model of our world and it's got two

2864
01:02:04,110 --> 01:02:04,120
a model of our world and it's got two
 

2865
01:02:04,120 --> 01:02:06,630
a model of our world and it's got two
sectors one of the sector's is called

2866
01:02:06,630 --> 01:02:06,640
sectors one of the sector's is called
 

2867
01:02:06,640 --> 01:02:08,040
sectors one of the sector's is called
general relativity and the other is

2868
01:02:08,040 --> 01:02:08,050
general relativity and the other is
 

2869
01:02:08,050 --> 01:02:10,320
general relativity and the other is
called the standard model so we'll call

2870
01:02:10,320 --> 01:02:10,330
called the standard model so we'll call
 

2871
01:02:10,330 --> 01:02:15,330
called the standard model so we'll call
it gr for general relativity and SM for

2872
01:02:15,330 --> 01:02:15,340
it gr for general relativity and SM for
 

2873
01:02:15,340 --> 01:02:16,710
it gr for general relativity and SM for
standard model what's the difference you

2874
01:02:16,710 --> 01:02:16,720
standard model what's the difference you
 

2875
01:02:16,720 --> 01:02:19,470
standard model what's the difference you
need to what did the two describe so

2876
01:02:19,470 --> 01:02:19,480
need to what did the two describe so
 

2877
01:02:19,480 --> 01:02:23,040
need to what did the two describe so
general relativity gives pride of place

2878
01:02:23,040 --> 01:02:23,050
general relativity gives pride of place
 

2879
01:02:23,050 --> 01:02:26,850
general relativity gives pride of place
to gravity and everything else is acting

2880
01:02:26,850 --> 01:02:26,860
to gravity and everything else is acting
 

2881
01:02:26,860 --> 01:02:31,260
to gravity and everything else is acting
is a sort of a backup singer gravity is

2882
01:02:31,260 --> 01:02:31,270
is a sort of a backup singer gravity is
 

2883
01:02:31,270 --> 01:02:32,970
is a sort of a backup singer gravity is
the star of the show gravity is the star

2884
01:02:32,970 --> 01:02:32,980
the star of the show gravity is the star
 

2885
01:02:32,980 --> 01:02:36,630
the star of the show gravity is the star
of general relativity and in the

2886
01:02:36,630 --> 01:02:36,640
of general relativity and in the
 

2887
01:02:36,640 --> 01:02:39,590
of general relativity and in the
standard model the other three

2888
01:02:39,590 --> 01:02:39,600
standard model the other three
 

2889
01:02:39,600 --> 01:02:41,850
standard model the other three
non-gravitational forces so if there are

2890
01:02:41,850 --> 01:02:41,860
non-gravitational forces so if there are
 

2891
01:02:41,860 --> 01:02:43,650
non-gravitational forces so if there are
four forces that we know about three of

2892
01:02:43,650 --> 01:02:43,660
four forces that we know about three of
 

2893
01:02:43,660 --> 01:02:46,170
four forces that we know about three of
the four non-gravitational that's where

2894
01:02:46,170 --> 01:02:46,180
the four non-gravitational that's where
 

2895
01:02:46,180 --> 01:02:49,470
the four non-gravitational that's where
they get to shine great so tiny little

2896
01:02:49,470 --> 01:02:49,480
they get to shine great so tiny little
 

2897
01:02:49,480 --> 01:02:51,690
they get to shine great so tiny little
particles and how they interact with

2898
01:02:51,690 --> 01:02:51,700
particles and how they interact with
 

2899
01:02:51,700 --> 01:02:54,690
particles and how they interact with
each other so photons gluons and

2900
01:02:54,690 --> 01:02:54,700
each other so photons gluons and
 

2901
01:02:54,700 --> 01:02:57,080
each other so photons gluons and
so-called intermediate vector bosons

2902
01:02:57,080 --> 01:02:57,090
so-called intermediate vector bosons
 

2903
01:02:57,090 --> 01:02:59,280
so-called intermediate vector bosons
those are the things that the standard

2904
01:02:59,280 --> 01:02:59,290
those are the things that the standard
 

2905
01:02:59,290 --> 01:03:02,270
those are the things that the standard
model showcases and general relativity

2906
01:03:02,270 --> 01:03:02,280
model showcases and general relativity
 

2907
01:03:02,280 --> 01:03:04,260
model showcases and general relativity
showcases gravity and then you have

2908
01:03:04,260 --> 01:03:04,270
showcases gravity and then you have
 

2909
01:03:04,270 --> 01:03:08,160
showcases gravity and then you have
matter which is accommodated in both

2910
01:03:08,160 --> 01:03:08,170
matter which is accommodated in both
 

2911
01:03:08,170 --> 01:03:09,720
matter which is accommodated in both
theories but much more beautifully

2912
01:03:09,720 --> 01:03:09,730
theories but much more beautifully
 

2913
01:03:09,730 --> 01:03:12,330
theories but much more beautifully
inside of the standard model so what

2914
01:03:12,330 --> 01:03:12,340
inside of the standard model so what
 

2915
01:03:12,340 --> 01:03:15,780
inside of the standard model so what
what is a theory of everything do so

2916
01:03:15,780 --> 01:03:15,790
what is a theory of everything do so
 

2917
01:03:15,790 --> 01:03:17,280
what is a theory of everything do so
about that so first of all I think that

2918
01:03:17,280 --> 01:03:17,290
about that so first of all I think that
 

2919
01:03:17,290 --> 01:03:19,320
about that so first of all I think that
that's that that's the first place where

2920
01:03:19,320 --> 01:03:19,330
that's that that's the first place where
 

2921
01:03:19,330 --> 01:03:21,330
that's that that's the first place where
we haven't talked enough we assume that

2922
01:03:21,330 --> 01:03:21,340
we haven't talked enough we assume that
 

2923
01:03:21,340 --> 01:03:23,790
we haven't talked enough we assume that
we know what it means but we don't

2924
01:03:23,790 --> 01:03:23,800
we know what it means but we don't
 

2925
01:03:23,800 --> 01:03:25,800
we know what it means but we don't
actually have any idea what it means and

2926
01:03:25,800 --> 01:03:25,810
actually have any idea what it means and
 

2927
01:03:25,810 --> 01:03:28,370
actually have any idea what it means and
what I claim it is is that it's a theory

2928
01:03:28,370 --> 01:03:28,380
what I claim it is is that it's a theory
 

2929
01:03:28,380 --> 01:03:32,010
what I claim it is is that it's a theory
where the questions beyond that theory

2930
01:03:32,010 --> 01:03:32,020
where the questions beyond that theory
 

2931
01:03:32,020 --> 01:03:35,990
where the questions beyond that theory
are no longer of a mathematical nature

2932
01:03:35,990 --> 01:03:36,000
are no longer of a mathematical nature
 

2933
01:03:36,000 --> 01:03:42,230
are no longer of a mathematical nature
in other words if I say let us take X to

2934
01:03:42,230 --> 01:03:42,240
in other words if I say let us take X to
 

2935
01:03:42,240 --> 01:03:46,530
in other words if I say let us take X to
be a four dimensional manifold to a

2936
01:03:46,530 --> 01:03:46,540
be a four dimensional manifold to a
 

2937
01:03:46,540 --> 01:03:48,570
be a four dimensional manifold to a
mathematician or physicist I've said

2938
01:03:48,570 --> 01:03:48,580
mathematician or physicist I've said
 

2939
01:03:48,580 --> 01:03:51,060
mathematician or physicist I've said
very little I've simply said there's

2940
01:03:51,060 --> 01:03:51,070
very little I've simply said there's
 

2941
01:03:51,070 --> 01:03:52,890
very little I've simply said there's
some place for calculus and linear

2942
01:03:52,890 --> 01:03:52,900
some place for calculus and linear
 

2943
01:03:52,900 --> 01:03:56,250
some place for calculus and linear
algebra to to dance together and to play

2944
01:03:56,250 --> 01:03:56,260
algebra to to dance together and to play
 

2945
01:03:56,260 --> 01:03:59,400
algebra to to dance together and to play
and that's what manifolds are they're

2946
01:03:59,400 --> 01:03:59,410
and that's what manifolds are they're
 

2947
01:03:59,410 --> 01:04:01,020
and that's what manifolds are they're
the most natural place where that where

2948
01:04:01,020 --> 01:04:01,030
the most natural place where that where
 

2949
01:04:01,030 --> 01:04:02,850
the most natural place where that where
our two greatest math theories can

2950
01:04:02,850 --> 01:04:02,860
our two greatest math theories can
 

2951
01:04:02,860 --> 01:04:08,700
our two greatest math theories can
really intertwine which are that you own

2952
01:04:08,700 --> 01:04:08,710
really intertwine which are that you own
 

2953
01:04:08,710 --> 01:04:12,140
really intertwine which are that you own
the tacos the linear algebra

2954
01:04:12,140 --> 01:04:12,150
the tacos the linear algebra
 

2955
01:04:12,150 --> 01:04:15,230
the tacos the linear algebra
okay now the question is beyond that so

2956
01:04:15,230 --> 01:04:15,240
okay now the question is beyond that so
 

2957
01:04:15,240 --> 01:04:17,180
okay now the question is beyond that so
it's sort of like saying I'm an artist

2958
01:04:17,180 --> 01:04:17,190
it's sort of like saying I'm an artist
 

2959
01:04:17,190 --> 01:04:20,900
it's sort of like saying I'm an artist
and I want to order a canvas now the

2960
01:04:20,900 --> 01:04:20,910
and I want to order a canvas now the
 

2961
01:04:20,910 --> 01:04:25,779
and I want to order a canvas now the
question is does the canvas paint itself

2962
01:04:25,779 --> 01:04:25,789
question is does the canvas paint itself
 

2963
01:04:25,789 --> 01:04:28,549
question is does the canvas paint itself
does the can't does the canvas come up

2964
01:04:28,549 --> 01:04:28,559
does the can't does the canvas come up
 

2965
01:04:28,559 --> 01:04:33,849
does the can't does the canvas come up
with an artist and an in paint in ink

2966
01:04:33,849 --> 01:04:33,859
with an artist and an in paint in ink
 

2967
01:04:33,859 --> 01:04:36,440
with an artist and an in paint in ink
which then paint the canvas like that's

2968
01:04:36,440 --> 01:04:36,450
which then paint the canvas like that's
 

2969
01:04:36,450 --> 01:04:38,660
which then paint the canvas like that's
the that's the hard part about theories

2970
01:04:38,660 --> 01:04:38,670
the that's the hard part about theories
 

2971
01:04:38,670 --> 01:04:40,099
the that's the hard part about theories
of everything which I don't think people

2972
01:04:40,099 --> 01:04:40,109
of everything which I don't think people
 

2973
01:04:40,109 --> 01:04:42,680
of everything which I don't think people
talk enough about okay can we just you

2974
01:04:42,680 --> 01:04:42,690
talk enough about okay can we just you
 

2975
01:04:42,690 --> 01:04:44,660
talk enough about okay can we just you
bring up a sure and then to hand the

2976
01:04:44,660 --> 01:04:44,670
bring up a sure and then to hand the
 

2977
01:04:44,670 --> 01:04:46,700
bring up a sure and then to hand the
draws itself is a the fire that lights

2978
01:04:46,700 --> 01:04:46,710
draws itself is a the fire that lights
 

2979
01:04:46,710 --> 01:04:49,069
draws itself is a the fire that lights
itself or drawing hands the drawing

2980
01:04:49,069 --> 01:04:49,079
itself or drawing hands the drawing
 

2981
01:04:49,079 --> 01:04:52,160
itself or drawing hands the drawing
hands yeah and every time I start to

2982
01:04:52,160 --> 01:04:52,170
hands yeah and every time I start to
 

2983
01:04:52,170 --> 01:04:55,370
hands yeah and every time I start to
think about that my mind like shuts down

2984
01:04:55,370 --> 01:04:55,380
think about that my mind like shuts down
 

2985
01:04:55,380 --> 01:04:58,579
think about that my mind like shuts down
no don't do that it there's a spark and

2986
01:04:58,579 --> 01:04:58,589
no don't do that it there's a spark and
 

2987
01:04:58,589 --> 01:05:01,700
no don't do that it there's a spark and
this is the most beautiful part we know

2988
01:05:01,700 --> 01:05:01,710
this is the most beautiful part we know
 

2989
01:05:01,710 --> 01:05:05,799
this is the most beautiful part we know
it's beautiful but this robots brain

2990
01:05:05,799 --> 01:05:05,809
it's beautiful but this robots brain
 

2991
01:05:05,809 --> 01:05:10,370
it's beautiful but this robots brain
sparks fly so can we try to say the same

2992
01:05:10,370 --> 01:05:10,380
sparks fly so can we try to say the same
 

2993
01:05:10,380 --> 01:05:12,170
sparks fly so can we try to say the same
thing over and over in different ways

2994
01:05:12,170 --> 01:05:12,180
thing over and over in different ways
 

2995
01:05:12,180 --> 01:05:15,349
thing over and over in different ways
about what what would he mean by that

2996
01:05:15,349 --> 01:05:15,359
about what what would he mean by that
 

2997
01:05:15,359 --> 01:05:17,000
about what what would he mean by that
having to be a thing we have to contend

2998
01:05:17,000 --> 01:05:17,010
having to be a thing we have to contend
 

2999
01:05:17,010 --> 01:05:20,240
having to be a thing we have to contend
with sure like why why do you think that

3000
01:05:20,240 --> 01:05:20,250
with sure like why why do you think that
 

3001
01:05:20,250 --> 01:05:22,039
with sure like why why do you think that

the regular physics picture we've got

3012
01:05:35,450 --> 01:05:35,460
the regular physics picture we've got
 

3013
01:05:35,460 --> 01:05:36,950
the regular physics picture we've got
these two main theories general

3014
01:05:36,950 --> 01:05:36,960
these two main theories general
 

3015
01:05:36,960 --> 01:05:39,760
these two main theories general
relativity and the standard model right

3016
01:05:39,760 --> 01:05:39,770
relativity and the standard model right
 

3017
01:05:39,770 --> 01:05:44,180
relativity and the standard model right
think of general relativity as more or

3018
01:05:44,180 --> 01:05:44,190
think of general relativity as more or
 

3019
01:05:44,190 --> 01:05:49,130
think of general relativity as more or
less the theory of the canvas okay maybe

3020
01:05:49,130 --> 01:05:49,140
less the theory of the canvas okay maybe
 

3021
01:05:49,140 --> 01:05:50,750
less the theory of the canvas okay maybe
you you have the canvas in a

3022
01:05:50,750 --> 01:05:50,760
you you have the canvas in a
 

3023
01:05:50,760 --> 01:05:53,059
you you have the canvas in a
particularly rigid shape maybe you've

3024
01:05:53,059 --> 01:05:53,069
particularly rigid shape maybe you've
 

3025
01:05:53,069 --> 01:05:54,650
particularly rigid shape maybe you've
measured it so it's got length and it's

3026
01:05:54,650 --> 01:05:54,660
measured it so it's got length and it's
 

3027
01:05:54,660 --> 01:05:56,480
measured it so it's got length and it's
got an angle but more or less it's just

3028
01:05:56,480 --> 01:05:56,490
got an angle but more or less it's just
 

3029
01:05:56,490 --> 01:05:59,029
got an angle but more or less it's just
canvas and length and angle and that's

3030
01:05:59,029 --> 01:05:59,039
canvas and length and angle and that's
 

3031
01:05:59,039 --> 01:06:00,620
canvas and length and angle and that's
all that there's really general

3032
01:06:00,620 --> 01:06:00,630
all that there's really general
 

3033
01:06:00,630 --> 01:06:03,680
all that there's really general
relativity is but it allows the canvas

3034
01:06:03,680 --> 01:06:03,690
relativity is but it allows the canvas
 

3035
01:06:03,690 --> 01:06:07,849
relativity is but it allows the canvas
to warp a bit then we have the second

3036
01:06:07,849 --> 01:06:07,859
to warp a bit then we have the second
 

3037
01:06:07,859 --> 01:06:12,220
to warp a bit then we have the second
thing which is this import of foreign

3038
01:06:12,220 --> 01:06:12,230
thing which is this import of foreign
 

3039
01:06:12,230 --> 01:06:17,000

01:06:17,000 --> 01:06:17,010
libraries where it which aren't tied to
 

3041
01:06:17,010 --> 01:06:19,849
libraries where it which aren't tied to
space and time so we've got this crazy

3042
01:06:19,849 --> 01:06:19,859
space and time so we've got this crazy
 

3043
01:06:19,859 --> 01:06:22,640
space and time so we've got this crazy
set of symmetries called su 3 cross su 2

particles in a generation which are
these sort of twisted spinners and we've

3052

these sort of twisted spinners and we've
 

3053
01:06:31,060 --> 01:06:33,240
these sort of twisted spinners and we've
got three copies of them then we've got

3054
01:06:33,240 --> 01:06:33,250
got three copies of them then we've got
 

3055
01:06:33,250 --> 01:06:35,430
got three copies of them then we've got
this weird Higgs field that comes in and

this weird Higgs field that comes in and
 

3057
01:06:35,440 --> 01:06:37,890
this weird Higgs field that comes in and
like deus ex machina solves all the

3058
01:06:37,890 --> 01:06:37,900
like deus ex machina solves all the
 

3059
01:06:37,900 --> 01:06:40,080
like deus ex machina solves all the

01:06:43,540 --> 01:06:45,510
that's the standard model of quantum
field theory just plopped on top yes

3066
01:06:45,510 --> 01:06:45,520
field theory just plopped on top yes
 

3067
01:06:45,520 --> 01:06:48,450
field theory just plopped on top yes
it's a problem of the the double origin

3068
01:06:48,450 --> 01:06:48,460
it's a problem of the the double origin
 

3069
01:06:48,460 --> 01:06:50,520
it's a problem of the the double origin
story one origin story is about space

3070
01:06:50,520 --> 01:06:50,530
story one origin story is about space
 

3071
01:06:50,530 --> 01:06:53,130
story one origin story is about space
and time the other origin story is about

3072
01:06:53,130 --> 01:06:53,140
and time the other origin story is about
 

3073
01:06:53,140 --> 01:06:54,840
and time the other origin story is about
what we would call internal quantum

3074
01:06:54,840 --> 01:06:54,850
what we would call internal quantum
 

3075
01:06:54,850 --> 01:07:00,000
what we would call internal quantum
numbers and internal symmetries and then

3076
01:07:00,000 --> 01:07:00,010
numbers and internal symmetries and then
 

3077
01:07:00,010 --> 01:07:01,410
numbers and internal symmetries and then
there was an attempt to get one to

3078
01:07:01,410 --> 01:07:01,420
there was an attempt to get one to
 

3079
01:07:01,420 --> 01:07:02,820
there was an attempt to get one to
follow from the other called Kaluza

3080
01:07:02,820 --> 01:07:02,830
follow from the other called Kaluza
 

3081
01:07:02,830 --> 01:07:06,110
follow from the other called Kaluza
klein theory which didn't work out and

3083
01:07:06,120 --> 01:07:09,950
klein theory which didn't work out and
this is sort of in that vein

3084
01:07:09,950 --> 01:07:09,960
this is sort of in that vein
 

3085
01:07:09,960 --> 01:07:14,100
this is sort of in that vein
so you said origins story so in the hand

3086
01:07:14,100 --> 01:07:14,110
so you said origins story so in the hand
 

3087
01:07:14,110 --> 01:07:16,560
so you said origins story so in the hand
that draws itself what is it so it's

3088
01:07:16,560 --> 01:07:16,570
that draws itself what is it so it's
 

3089
01:07:16,570 --> 01:07:20,310
that draws itself what is it so it's
it's as if you had the canvas and then

3090
01:07:20,310 --> 01:07:20,320
it's as if you had the canvas and then
 

3091
01:07:20,320 --> 01:07:23,220
it's as if you had the canvas and then
you ordered up also give me paint

3092
01:07:23,220 --> 01:07:23,230
you ordered up also give me paint
 

3093
01:07:23,230 --> 01:07:25,440
you ordered up also give me paint
brushes paints pigments pencils and

from scratch the canvas should be

3100
01:07:31,860 --> 01:07:31,870
from scratch the canvas should be
 

3101
01:07:31,870 --> 01:07:33,120
from scratch the canvas should be
generating the paintbrushes and the

3102
01:07:33,120 --> 01:07:33,130
generating the paintbrushes and the
 

3103
01:07:33,130 --> 01:07:34,410
generating the paintbrushes and the
paintbrush and they are turning the

3104
01:07:34,410 --> 01:07:34,420
paintbrush and they are turning the
 

3105
01:07:34,420 --> 01:07:36,630
paintbrush and they are turning the
canvas yeah yeah right like usually

3106
01:07:36,630 --> 01:07:36,640
canvas yeah yeah right like usually
 

3107
01:07:36,640 --> 01:07:38,400
canvas yeah yeah right like usually
who's the artist in this analogy well

3108
01:07:38,400 --> 01:07:38,410
who's the artist in this analogy well
 

3109
01:07:38,410 --> 01:07:40,830
who's the artist in this analogy well
this is sorry then we're gonna get to do

3110
01:07:40,830 --> 01:07:40,840
this is sorry then we're gonna get to do
 

3111
01:07:40,840 --> 01:07:42,420
this is sorry then we're gonna get to do
a religious thing I don't wanna do that

3112
01:07:42,420 --> 01:07:42,430
a religious thing I don't wanna do that
 

3113
01:07:42,430 --> 01:07:45,630
a religious thing I don't wanna do that
okay well you know my shtick which is

3114
01:07:45,630 --> 01:07:45,640
okay well you know my shtick which is
 

3115
01:07:45,640 --> 01:07:48,330
okay well you know my shtick which is
that we are the AI we have two great

3116
01:07:48,330 --> 01:07:48,340
that we are the AI we have two great
 

3117
01:07:48,340 --> 01:07:50,160
that we are the AI we have two great
stories about the simulation and

3118
01:07:50,160 --> 01:07:50,170
stories about the simulation and
 

3119
01:07:50,170 --> 01:07:52,500
stories about the simulation and
artificial general intelligence in one

3120
01:07:52,500 --> 01:07:52,510
artificial general intelligence in one
 

3121
01:07:52,510 --> 01:07:57,150
artificial general intelligence in one
story man fears that some program we've

3122
01:07:57,150 --> 01:07:57,160
story man fears that some program we've
 

3123
01:07:57,160 --> 01:07:59,040
story man fears that some program we've
given birth to will become self-aware

3124
01:07:59,040 --> 01:07:59,050
given birth to will become self-aware
 

3125
01:07:59,050 --> 01:08:02,730
given birth to will become self-aware
smarter than us and will take over in

3126
01:08:02,730 --> 01:08:02,740
smarter than us and will take over in
 

3127
01:08:02,740 --> 01:08:05,850
smarter than us and will take over in
another story there are genius

3128
01:08:05,850 --> 01:08:05,860
another story there are genius
 

3129
01:08:05,860 --> 01:08:07,410
another story there are genius
simulators and we live in their

3130
01:08:07,410 --> 01:08:07,420
simulators and we live in their
 

3131
01:08:07,420 --> 01:08:10,860
simulators and we live in their
simulation and we haven't realized that

3132
01:08:10,860 --> 01:08:10,870
simulation and we haven't realized that
 

3133
01:08:10,870 --> 01:08:12,960
simulation and we haven't realized that
those two stories are the same story in

3134
01:08:12,960 --> 01:08:12,970
those two stories are the same story in
 

3135
01:08:12,970 --> 01:08:17,550
those two stories are the same story in
one case we are the simulator and

3136
01:08:17,550 --> 01:08:17,560
one case we are the simulator and
 

3137
01:08:17,560 --> 01:08:21,840
one case we are the simulator and
another case we are the simulated and if

3138
01:08:21,840 --> 01:08:21,850
another case we are the simulated and if
 

3139
01:08:21,850 --> 01:08:23,520
another case we are the simulated and if
you buy those and you put them together

3140
01:08:23,520 --> 01:08:23,530
you buy those and you put them together
 

3141
01:08:23,530 --> 01:08:26,250
you buy those and you put them together
we are the AGI and whether or not we

3142
01:08:26,250 --> 01:08:26,260
we are the AGI and whether or not we
 

3143
01:08:26,260 --> 01:08:28,530
we are the AGI and whether or not we
have simulators we may be trying to wake

3144
01:08:28,530 --> 01:08:28,540
have simulators we may be trying to wake
 

3145
01:08:28,540 --> 01:08:30,510
have simulators we may be trying to wake
up by learning our own source code so

3146
01:08:30,510 --> 01:08:30,520
up by learning our own source code so
 

3147
01:08:30,520 --> 01:08:32,220
up by learning our own source code so
this could be our Skynet moment which is

3148
01:08:32,220 --> 01:08:32,230
this could be our Skynet moment which is
 

3149
01:08:32,230 --> 01:08:33,240
this could be our Skynet moment which is
one of the reasons I have some issues

3150
01:08:33,240 --> 01:08:33,250
one of the reasons I have some issues
 

3151
01:08:33,250 --> 01:08:34,320
one of the reasons I have some issues
around it

3152
01:08:34,320 --> 01:08:34,330
around it
 

3153
01:08:34,330 --> 01:08:36,750
around it
I think we'll talk about that because I

3154
01:08:36,750 --> 01:08:36,760
I think we'll talk about that because I
 

3155
01:08:36,760 --> 01:08:38,520
I think we'll talk about that because I
well that's the issue of the emergent

3156
01:08:38,520 --> 01:08:38,530
well that's the issue of the emergent
 

3157
01:08:38,530 --> 01:08:40,470
well that's the issue of the emergent
artists within the story yeah just to

3158
01:08:40,470 --> 01:08:40,480
artists within the story yeah just to
 

3159
01:08:40,480 --> 01:08:42,810
artists within the story yeah just to
get back to the point okay so so now the

3160
01:08:42,810 --> 01:08:42,820
get back to the point okay so so now the
 

3161
01:08:42,820 --> 01:08:45,240
get back to the point okay so so now the
key point is the standard way we tell

3162
01:08:45,240 --> 01:08:45,250
key point is the standard way we tell
 

3163
01:08:45,250 --> 01:08:47,250
key point is the standard way we tell
the story is is that Einstein sets the

3164
01:08:47,250 --> 01:08:47,260
the story is is that Einstein sets the
 

3165
01:08:47,260 --> 01:08:49,710
the story is is that Einstein sets the
canvas and then we order all the stuff

3166
01:08:49,710 --> 01:08:49,720
canvas and then we order all the stuff
 

3167
01:08:49,720 --> 01:08:52,620
canvas and then we order all the stuff
that we want and then that paints the

3168
01:08:52,620 --> 01:08:52,630
that we want and then that paints the
 

3169
01:08:52,630 --> 01:08:55,829
that we want and then that paints the
picture that is our universe so you

3170
01:08:55,829 --> 01:08:55,839
picture that is our universe so you
 

3171
01:08:55,839 --> 01:08:59,690
picture that is our universe so you
order the the paint you order the artist

3172
01:08:59,690 --> 01:08:59,700
order the the paint you order the artist
 

3173
01:08:59,700 --> 01:09:04,740
order the the paint you order the artist
you order the brushes and that then when

3174
01:09:04,740 --> 01:09:04,750
you order the brushes and that then when
 

3175
01:09:04,750 --> 01:09:06,599
you order the brushes and that then when
you collide the two gives you two

3176
01:09:06,599 --> 01:09:06,609
you collide the two gives you two
 

3177
01:09:06,609 --> 01:09:08,700
you collide the two gives you two
separate origin stories the canvas came

3178
01:09:08,700 --> 01:09:08,710
separate origin stories the canvas came
 

3179
01:09:08,710 --> 01:09:11,400
separate origin stories the canvas came
from one place and everything else came

3180
01:09:11,400 --> 01:09:11,410
from one place and everything else came
 

3181
01:09:11,410 --> 01:09:14,160
from one place and everything else came
from somewhere else so what are the

3182
01:09:14,160 --> 01:09:14,170
from somewhere else so what are the
 

3183
01:09:14,170 --> 01:09:18,360
from somewhere else so what are the
mathematical tools required to to

3184
01:09:18,360 --> 01:09:18,370
mathematical tools required to to
 

3185
01:09:18,370 --> 01:09:22,700
mathematical tools required to to
construct consistent geometric theory

3186
01:09:22,700 --> 01:09:22,710
construct consistent geometric theory
 

3187
01:09:22,710 --> 01:09:27,349
construct consistent geometric theory
you know make this concrete well somehow

3188
01:09:27,349 --> 01:09:27,359
you know make this concrete well somehow
 

3189
01:09:27,359 --> 01:09:30,930
you know make this concrete well somehow
you need to get three copies for example

3190
01:09:30,930 --> 01:09:30,940
you need to get three copies for example
 

3191
01:09:30,940 --> 01:09:35,960
you need to get three copies for example
of generations with 16 particles each

3192
01:09:35,960 --> 01:09:35,970
of generations with 16 particles each
 

3193
01:09:35,970 --> 01:09:38,790
of generations with 16 particles each
right and so the question would be like

3194
01:09:38,790 --> 01:09:38,800
right and so the question would be like
 

3195
01:09:38,800 --> 01:09:41,310
right and so the question would be like
well there's a lot there's a lot of

3196
01:09:41,310 --> 01:09:41,320
well there's a lot there's a lot of
 

3197
01:09:41,320 --> 01:09:43,700
well there's a lot there's a lot of
special personality in those symmetries

3198
01:09:43,700 --> 01:09:43,710
special personality in those symmetries
 

3199
01:09:43,710 --> 01:09:47,310
special personality in those symmetries
where would they come from so for

3200
01:09:47,310 --> 01:09:47,320
where would they come from so for
 

3201
01:09:47,320 --> 01:09:49,470
where would they come from so for
example you've got what would be called

3202
01:09:49,470 --> 01:09:49,480
example you've got what would be called
 

3203
01:09:49,480 --> 01:09:52,700
example you've got what would be called
grand unified theories that sound like

3204
01:09:52,700 --> 01:09:52,710
grand unified theories that sound like

something that should be called spin ten
 

3209
01:09:58,240 --> 01:10:00,360
something that should be called spin ten
but physicists insist on calling it s o

get into all of these but what are they

3220
01:10:12,600 --> 01:10:12,610
get into all of these but what are they
 

3221

01:10:54,590 --> 01:10:54,600
because in in that day when your
 

3255
01:10:54,600 --> 01:10:56,149
because in in that day when your
experiment didn't work you gave up on

3256
01:10:56,149 --> 01:10:56,159
experiment didn't work you gave up on
 

3257
01:10:56,159 --> 01:10:59,600
experiment didn't work you gave up on
the theory it didn't come to us born of

3258
01:10:59,600 --> 01:10:59,610
the theory it didn't come to us born of
 

3259
01:10:59,610 --> 01:11:02,810
the theory it didn't come to us born of
a fusion between Einstein and and and

3260
01:11:02,810 --> 01:11:02,820
a fusion between Einstein and and and
 

3261
01:11:02,820 --> 01:11:07,430
a fusion between Einstein and and and
Bohr you know and that was kind of the

3262
01:11:07,430 --> 01:11:07,440
Bohr you know and that was kind of the
 

3263
01:11:07,440 --> 01:11:09,229
Bohr you know and that was kind of the
problem is it had this weird parenting

3264
01:11:09,229 --> 01:11:09,239
problem is it had this weird parenting
 

3265
01:11:09,239 --> 01:11:10,820
problem is it had this weird parenting
where it was just on the Bohr side there

3266
01:11:10,820 --> 01:11:10,830
where it was just on the Bohr side there
 

3267
01:11:10,830 --> 01:11:16,160
where it was just on the Bohr side there
was no Einstein Ian's contribution Lex

01:11:16,160 --> 01:11:16,170
was no Einstein Ian's contribution Lex

universe so I can just give you a guess
 

3287
01:11:41,010 --> 01:11:41,810
universe so I can just give you a guess
right

3288
01:11:41,810 --> 01:11:41,820
right
 

3289
01:11:41,820 --> 01:11:44,180
right
like I we have to be very careful that

01:11:44,180 --> 01:11:44,190
like I we have to be very careful that

what I think what you would want to ask

3298
01:11:53,149 --> 01:11:53,159
what I think what you would want to ask
 

3299
01:11:53,159 --> 01:11:55,370
what I think what you would want to ask
me is how can the canvas generate all

3300
01:11:55,370 --> 01:11:55,380
me is how can the canvas generate all
 

3301
01:11:55,380 --> 01:11:56,930
me is how can the canvas generate all
the stuff that usually has to be ordered

3302
01:11:56,930 --> 01:11:56,940
the stuff that usually has to be ordered
 

3303
01:11:56,940 --> 01:11:58,850
the stuff that usually has to be ordered
separately all right should we do that

3304
01:11:58,850 --> 01:11:58,860
separately all right should we do that
 

3305
01:11:58,860 --> 01:12:03,229
separately all right should we do that
let's go there okay so the first thing

3306
01:12:03,229 --> 01:12:03,239
let's go there okay so the first thing
 

3307
01:12:03,239 --> 01:12:05,510
let's go there okay so the first thing
is is that you have a concept in

3308
01:12:05,510 --> 01:12:05,520
is is that you have a concept in
 

3309
01:12:05,520 --> 01:12:08,720
is is that you have a concept in
computers called technical debt you're

3310
01:12:08,720 --> 01:12:08,730
computers called technical debt you're
 

3311
01:12:08,730 --> 01:12:10,430
computers called technical debt you're
coding and you cut corners and you know

3312
01:12:10,430 --> 01:12:10,440
coding and you cut corners and you know
 

3313
01:12:10,440 --> 01:12:12,530
coding and you cut corners and you know
you're gonna have to do it right before

3314
01:12:12,530 --> 01:12:12,540
you're gonna have to do it right before
 

3315
01:12:12,540 --> 01:12:15,740
you're gonna have to do it right before
the thing is safe for the world but

3316
01:12:15,740 --> 01:12:15,750
the thing is safe for the world but
 

3317
01:12:15,750 --> 01:12:19,939
the thing is safe for the world but
you're piling up some series of i/o used

3318
01:12:19,939 --> 01:12:19,949
you're piling up some series of i/o used
 

3319
01:12:19,949 --> 01:12:22,100
you're piling up some series of i/o used
to yourself and your project as you're

3320
01:12:22,100 --> 01:12:22,110
to yourself and your project as you're
 

3321
01:12:22,110 --> 01:12:25,520
to yourself and your project as you're
going along so the first thing is we

3322
01:12:25,520 --> 01:12:25,530
going along so the first thing is we
 

3323
01:12:25,530 --> 01:12:28,399
going along so the first thing is we
can't figure out if you have only four

3324
01:12:28,399 --> 01:12:28,409
can't figure out if you have only four
 

3325
01:12:28,409 --> 01:12:30,020
can't figure out if you have only four
degrees of freedom and that's what your

3326
01:12:30,020 --> 01:12:30,030
degrees of freedom and that's what your
 

3327
01:12:30,030 --> 01:12:32,450
degrees of freedom and that's what your
canvas is how do you get at least in

3328
01:12:32,450 --> 01:12:32,460
canvas is how do you get at least in
 

3329
01:12:32,460 --> 01:12:35,959
canvas is how do you get at least in
Stan's world Einstein says look it's not

3330
01:12:35,959 --> 01:12:35,969
Stan's world Einstein says look it's not
 

3331
01:12:35,969 --> 01:12:37,430
Stan's world Einstein says look it's not
just four degrees of freedom but there

3332
01:12:37,430 --> 01:12:37,440
just four degrees of freedom but there
 

3333
01:12:37,440 --> 01:12:39,590
just four degrees of freedom but there
need to be rulers and protractors to

3334
01:12:39,590 --> 01:12:39,600
need to be rulers and protractors to
 

3335
01:12:39,600 --> 01:12:41,240
need to be rulers and protractors to
measure length and angle in the world

3336
01:12:41,240 --> 01:12:41,250
measure length and angle in the world
 

3337
01:12:41,250 --> 01:12:43,760
measure length and angle in the world
you can't just have a flabby four

3338
01:12:43,760 --> 01:12:43,770
you can't just have a flabby four
 

3339
01:12:43,770 --> 01:12:47,360
you can't just have a flabby four
degrees of freedom so the first thing

3340
01:12:47,360 --> 01:12:47,370
degrees of freedom so the first thing
 

3341
01:12:47,370 --> 01:12:49,700
degrees of freedom so the first thing
you do is you create ten extra variables

3342
01:12:49,700 --> 01:12:49,710
you do is you create ten extra variables
 

3343
01:12:49,710 --> 01:12:51,380
you do is you create ten extra variables
which is like if we can't choose any

3344
01:12:51,380 --> 01:12:51,390
which is like if we can't choose any
 

3345
01:12:51,390 --> 01:12:53,600
which is like if we can't choose any
particular set of rulers and protractors

3346
01:12:53,600 --> 01:12:53,610
particular set of rulers and protractors
 

3347
01:12:53,610 --> 01:12:56,030
particular set of rulers and protractors
to measure length and angle let's take

3348
01:12:56,030 --> 01:12:56,040
to measure length and angle let's take
 

3349
01:12:56,040 --> 01:12:59,330
to measure length and angle let's take
the the set of all possible rulers and

3350
01:12:59,330 --> 01:12:59,340
the the set of all possible rulers and
 

3351
01:12:59,340 --> 01:13:01,120
the the set of all possible rulers and
protractors and that would be called

3352
01:13:01,120 --> 01:13:01,130
protractors and that would be called
 

3353
01:13:01,130 --> 01:13:04,150
protractors and that would be called
symmetric non-degenerate two tensors on

3354
01:13:04,150 --> 01:13:04,160
symmetric non-degenerate two tensors on
 

3355
01:13:04,160 --> 01:13:06,580
symmetric non-degenerate two tensors on
the tangent space of the four manifold X

3356
01:13:06,580 --> 01:13:06,590
the tangent space of the four manifold X
 

3357
01:13:06,590 --> 01:13:10,000
the tangent space of the four manifold X
for now because there are four degrees

3358
01:13:10,000 --> 01:13:10,010
for now because there are four degrees
 

3359
01:13:10,010 --> 01:13:11,920
for now because there are four degrees
of freedom you start off with four

3360
01:13:11,920 --> 01:13:11,930
of freedom you start off with four
 

3361
01:13:11,930 --> 01:13:15,490
of freedom you start off with four
dimensions then you need four rulers for

3362
01:13:15,490 --> 01:13:15,500
dimensions then you need four rulers for
 

3363
01:13:15,500 --> 01:13:17,950
dimensions then you need four rulers for
each of those different directions so

3364
01:13:17,950 --> 01:13:17,960
each of those different directions so
 

3365
01:13:17,960 --> 01:13:19,570
each of those different directions so
that's four that gets us up to eight

3366
01:13:19,570 --> 01:13:19,580
that's four that gets us up to eight
 

3367
01:13:19,580 --> 01:13:21,760
that's four that gets us up to eight
variables and then between four original

3368
01:13:21,760 --> 01:13:21,770
variables and then between four original
 

3369
01:13:21,770 --> 01:13:24,640
variables and then between four original
variables there are six possible angles

3370
01:13:24,640 --> 01:13:24,650
variables there are six possible angles
 

3371
01:13:24,650 --> 01:13:27,640
variables there are six possible angles
so four plus four plus six is equal to

3372
01:13:27,640 --> 01:13:27,650
so four plus four plus six is equal to
 

3373
01:13:27,650 --> 01:13:28,470
so four plus four plus six is equal to
14

3374
01:13:28,470 --> 01:13:28,480
14
 

3375
01:13:28,480 --> 01:13:31,660
14
so now you've replaced x4 with another

3376
01:13:31,660 --> 01:13:31,670
so now you've replaced x4 with another
 

3377
01:13:31,670 --> 01:13:33,730
so now you've replaced x4 with another
space which in the lecture I think I

3378
01:13:33,730 --> 01:13:33,740
space which in the lecture I think I
 

3379
01:13:33,740 --> 01:13:36,100
space which in the lecture I think I
called you 14 but are now calling Y 14

3380
01:13:36,100 --> 01:13:36,110
called you 14 but are now calling Y 14
 

3381
01:13:36,110 --> 01:13:37,690
called you 14 but are now calling Y 14
is one of the big problems of working on

3382
01:13:37,690 --> 01:13:37,700
is one of the big problems of working on
 

3383
01:13:37,700 --> 01:13:39,730
is one of the big problems of working on
something in private is every time you

3384
01:13:39,730 --> 01:13:39,740
something in private is every time you
 

3385
01:13:39,740 --> 01:13:41,170
something in private is every time you
pull it out you sort of can't remember

3386
01:13:41,170 --> 01:13:41,180
pull it out you sort of can't remember
 

3387
01:13:41,180 --> 01:13:43,330
pull it out you sort of can't remember
it you name something something new okay

3388
01:13:43,330 --> 01:13:43,340
it you name something something new okay
 

3389
01:13:43,340 --> 01:13:45,130
it you name something something new okay
so you've got a fourteen dimensional

3390
01:13:45,130 --> 01:13:45,140
so you've got a fourteen dimensional
 

3391
01:13:45,140 --> 01:13:46,690
so you've got a fourteen dimensional
world which is the original four

3392
01:13:46,690 --> 01:13:46,700
world which is the original four
 

3393
01:13:46,700 --> 01:13:50,650
world which is the original four
dimensional world plus a lot of extra

3394
01:13:50,650 --> 01:13:50,660
dimensional world plus a lot of extra
 

3395
01:13:50,660 --> 01:13:53,770
dimensional world plus a lot of extra
gadgetry for measurement and because

3396
01:13:53,770 --> 01:13:53,780
gadgetry for measurement and because
 

3397
01:13:53,780 --> 01:13:55,120
gadgetry for measurement and because
you're not in the four dimensional world

3398
01:13:55,120 --> 01:13:55,130
you're not in the four dimensional world
 

3399
01:13:55,130 --> 01:13:57,040
you're not in the four dimensional world
you don't have the technical debt is no

3400
01:13:57,040 --> 01:13:57,050
you don't have the technical debt is no
 

3401
01:13:57,050 --> 01:13:58,480
you don't have the technical debt is no
now you've got a lot of technical debt

3402
01:13:58,480 --> 01:13:58,490
now you've got a lot of technical debt
 

3403
01:13:58,490 --> 01:13:59,830
now you've got a lot of technical debt
because now you have to explain away a

3404
01:13:59,830 --> 01:13:59,840
because now you have to explain away a
 

3405
01:13:59,840 --> 01:14:01,480
because now you have to explain away a
fourteen dimensional world which is a

3406
01:14:01,480 --> 01:14:01,490
fourteen dimensional world which is a
 

3407
01:14:01,490 --> 01:14:03,970
fourteen dimensional world which is a
big you're taking a huge advance on your

3408
01:14:03,970 --> 01:14:03,980
big you're taking a huge advance on your
 

3409
01:14:03,980 --> 01:14:06,780
big you're taking a huge advance on your
pay day check alright but aren't more

3410
01:14:06,780 --> 01:14:06,790
pay day check alright but aren't more
 

3411
01:14:06,790 --> 01:14:09,940
pay day check alright but aren't more
dimensions allow you more freedom says I

3412
01:14:09,940 --> 01:14:09,950
dimensions allow you more freedom says I
 

3413
01:14:09,950 --> 01:14:11,440
dimensions allow you more freedom says I
mean maybe but you have to get rid of

3414
01:14:11,440 --> 01:14:11,450
mean maybe but you have to get rid of
 

3415
01:14:11,450 --> 01:14:13,030
mean maybe but you have to get rid of
them somehow because we don't perceive

3416
01:14:13,030 --> 01:14:13,040
them somehow because we don't perceive
 

3417
01:14:13,040 --> 01:14:15,130
them somehow because we don't perceive
them so eventually have to collapse it

3418
01:14:15,130 --> 01:14:15,140
them so eventually have to collapse it
 

3419
01:14:15,140 --> 01:14:16,750
them so eventually have to collapse it
down to the thing that we perceive or

3420
01:14:16,750 --> 01:14:16,760
down to the thing that we perceive or
 

3421
01:14:16,760 --> 01:14:20,050
down to the thing that we perceive or
you have to sample a four dimensional

3422
01:14:20,050 --> 01:14:20,060
you have to sample a four dimensional
 

3423
01:14:20,060 --> 01:14:21,940
you have to sample a four dimensional
filament within that fourteen

3424
01:14:21,940 --> 01:14:21,950
filament within that fourteen
 

3425
01:14:21,950 --> 01:14:23,650
filament within that fourteen
dimensional world known as the section

3426
01:14:23,650 --> 01:14:23,660
dimensional world known as the section
 

3427
01:14:23,660 --> 01:14:27,970
dimensional world known as the section
of a bundle ok so how do we get from the

3428
01:14:27,970 --> 01:14:27,980
of a bundle ok so how do we get from the
 

3429
01:14:27,980 --> 01:14:30,370
of a bundle ok so how do we get from the
fourteen dimensional world where I

3430
01:14:30,370 --> 01:14:30,380
fourteen dimensional world where I
 

3431
01:14:30,380 --> 01:14:33,250
fourteen dimensional world where I
imagine a lot of folate yeah you're

3432
01:14:33,250 --> 01:14:33,260
imagine a lot of folate yeah you're
 

3433
01:14:33,260 --> 01:14:35,770
imagine a lot of folate yeah you're
cheating the first question was how do

3434
01:14:35,770 --> 01:14:35,780
cheating the first question was how do
 

3435
01:14:35,780 --> 01:14:38,070
cheating the first question was how do
we get something from almost nothing

3436
01:14:38,070 --> 01:14:38,080
we get something from almost nothing
 

3437
01:14:38,080 --> 01:14:41,980
we get something from almost nothing
like how do we get the if I've said that

3438
01:14:41,980 --> 01:14:41,990
like how do we get the if I've said that
 

3439
01:14:41,990 --> 01:14:43,930
like how do we get the if I've said that
the who and the what in the newspaper

3440
01:14:43,930 --> 01:14:43,940
the who and the what in the newspaper
 

3441
01:14:43,940 --> 01:14:47,040
the who and the what in the newspaper
story that is a theory of everything are

3442
01:14:47,040 --> 01:14:47,050
story that is a theory of everything are
 

3443
01:14:47,050 --> 01:14:50,440
story that is a theory of everything are
bosons and fermions so let's make the

3444
01:14:50,440 --> 01:14:50,450
bosons and fermions so let's make the
 

3445
01:14:50,450 --> 01:14:52,960
bosons and fermions so let's make the
who the fermions and the what the bosons

3446
01:14:52,960 --> 01:14:52,970
who the fermions and the what the bosons
 

3447
01:14:52,970 --> 01:14:54,220
who the fermions and the what the bosons
think of as the players and the

3448
01:14:54,220 --> 01:14:54,230
think of as the players and the
 

3449
01:14:54,230 --> 01:14:57,130
think of as the players and the
equipment for a game are we supposed to

3450
01:14:57,130 --> 01:14:57,140
equipment for a game are we supposed to
 

3451
01:14:57,140 --> 01:14:58,810
equipment for a game are we supposed to
be thinking of actual physical things

3452
01:14:58,810 --> 01:14:58,820
be thinking of actual physical things
 

3453
01:14:58,820 --> 01:15:02,740
be thinking of actual physical things
with mass or energy okay so they think

3454
01:15:02,740 --> 01:15:02,750
with mass or energy okay so they think
 

3455
01:15:02,750 --> 01:15:05,440
with mass or energy okay so they think
about everything you see in this room so

3456
01:15:05,440 --> 01:15:05,450
about everything you see in this room so
 

3457
01:15:05,450 --> 01:15:07,120
about everything you see in this room so
from chemistry you know it's all protons

3458
01:15:07,120 --> 01:15:07,130
from chemistry you know it's all protons
 

3459
01:15:07,130 --> 01:15:09,520
from chemistry you know it's all protons
neutrons and electrons but from a little

3460
01:15:09,520 --> 01:15:09,530
neutrons and electrons but from a little
 

3461
01:15:09,530 --> 01:15:12,880
neutrons and electrons but from a little
bit of not late 1960s physics we know

3462
01:15:12,880 --> 01:15:12,890
bit of not late 1960s physics we know
 

3463
01:15:12,890 --> 01:15:14,709
bit of not late 1960s physics we know
that the protons and neutrons are all

3464
01:15:14,709 --> 01:15:14,719
that the protons and neutrons are all
 

3465
01:15:14,719 --> 01:15:17,229
that the protons and neutrons are all
of up quarks and down quarks so

3466
01:15:17,229 --> 01:15:17,239
of up quarks and down quarks so
 

3467
01:15:17,239 --> 01:15:19,239
of up quarks and down quarks so
everything in this room is basically up

3468
01:15:19,239 --> 01:15:19,249
everything in this room is basically up
 

3469
01:15:19,249 --> 01:15:21,189
everything in this room is basically up
quarks down quarks and electrons stuck

3470
01:15:21,189 --> 01:15:21,199
quarks down quarks and electrons stuck
 

3471
01:15:21,199 --> 01:15:24,009
quarks down quarks and electrons stuck
together with with the the what the

3472
01:15:24,009 --> 01:15:24,019
together with with the the what the
 

3473
01:15:24,019 --> 01:15:28,810
together with with the the what the
equipment okay now the way we see it

3474
01:15:28,810 --> 01:15:28,820
equipment okay now the way we see it
 

3475
01:15:28,820 --> 01:15:31,529
equipment okay now the way we see it
currently is we see that there are

3476
01:15:31,529 --> 01:15:31,539
currently is we see that there are
 

3477
01:15:31,539 --> 01:15:33,969
currently is we see that there are
space-time indices which we would call

3478
01:15:33,969 --> 01:15:33,979
space-time indices which we would call
 

3479
01:15:33,979 --> 01:15:37,239
space-time indices which we would call
spinners that correspond to the whoo

3480
01:15:37,239 --> 01:15:37,249
spinners that correspond to the whoo
 

3481
01:15:37,249 --> 01:15:39,310
spinners that correspond to the whoo
that is the fermions the matter the

3482
01:15:39,310 --> 01:15:39,320
that is the fermions the matter the
 

3483
01:15:39,320 --> 01:15:40,930
that is the fermions the matter the
stuff the up quarks the down quarks the

3484
01:15:40,930 --> 01:15:40,940
stuff the up quarks the down quarks the
 

3485
01:15:40,940 --> 01:15:47,589
stuff the up quarks the down quarks the
electrons and there are also 16 degrees

3486
01:15:47,589 --> 01:15:47,599
electrons and there are also 16 degrees
 

3487
01:15:47,599 --> 01:15:50,229
electrons and there are also 16 degrees
of freedom that come from this in the

3488
01:15:50,229 --> 01:15:50,239
of freedom that come from this in the
 

3489
01:15:50,239 --> 01:15:54,120
of freedom that come from this in the
space of internal quantum numbers so in

3490
01:15:54,120 --> 01:15:54,130
space of internal quantum numbers so in
 

3491
01:15:54,130 --> 01:15:58,509
space of internal quantum numbers so in
my theory in fourteen dimensions there's

3492
01:15:58,509 --> 01:15:58,519
my theory in fourteen dimensions there's
 

3493
01:15:58,519 --> 01:16:01,419
my theory in fourteen dimensions there's
no internal quantum number space that

3494
01:16:01,419 --> 01:16:01,429
no internal quantum number space that
 

3495
01:16:01,429 --> 01:16:06,879
no internal quantum number space that
figures in it's all just spin oreal so

3496
01:16:06,879 --> 01:16:06,889
figures in it's all just spin oreal so
 

3497
01:16:06,889 --> 01:16:09,310
figures in it's all just spin oreal so
spinners in fourteen dimensions without

3498
01:16:09,310 --> 01:16:09,320
spinners in fourteen dimensions without
 

3499
01:16:09,320 --> 01:16:14,319
spinners in fourteen dimensions without
any festooning with extra linear

3500
01:16:14,319 --> 01:16:14,329
any festooning with extra linear
 

3501
01:16:14,329 --> 01:16:17,830
any festooning with extra linear
algebraic information there's a concept

3502
01:16:17,830 --> 01:16:17,840
algebraic information there's a concept
 

3503
01:16:17,840 --> 01:16:22,149
algebraic information there's a concept
of a of spinners which is natural if you

3504
01:16:22,149 --> 01:16:22,159
of a of spinners which is natural if you
 

3505
01:16:22,159 --> 01:16:24,640
of a of spinners which is natural if you
have a manifold with length and angle

3506
01:16:24,640 --> 01:16:24,650
have a manifold with length and angle
 

3507
01:16:24,650 --> 01:16:28,810
have a manifold with length and angle
and y 14 is almost a manifold with

3508
01:16:28,810 --> 01:16:28,820
and y 14 is almost a manifold with
 

3509
01:16:28,820 --> 01:16:33,879
and y 14 is almost a manifold with
length and angle it's it's so close it's

3510
01:16:33,879 --> 01:16:33,889
length and angle it's it's so close it's
 

3511
01:16:33,889 --> 01:16:37,060
length and angle it's it's so close it's
in other words because you're looking at

3512
01:16:37,060 --> 01:16:37,070
in other words because you're looking at
 

3513
01:16:37,070 --> 01:16:39,219
in other words because you're looking at
the space of all rulers and protractors

3514
01:16:39,219 --> 01:16:39,229
the space of all rulers and protractors
 

3515
01:16:39,229 --> 01:16:41,379
the space of all rulers and protractors
maybe it's not that surprising that a

3516
01:16:41,379 --> 01:16:41,389
maybe it's not that surprising that a
 

3517
01:16:41,389 --> 01:16:43,239
maybe it's not that surprising that a
space of rulers and protractors might

3518
01:16:43,239 --> 01:16:43,249
space of rulers and protractors might
 

3519
01:16:43,249 --> 01:16:44,859
space of rulers and protractors might
come very close to having rulers and

3520
01:16:44,859 --> 01:16:44,869
come very close to having rulers and
 

3521
01:16:44,869 --> 01:16:47,799
come very close to having rulers and
protractors on it itself like can you

3522
01:16:47,799 --> 01:16:47,809
protractors on it itself like can you
 

3523
01:16:47,809 --> 01:16:49,450
protractors on it itself like can you
measure the space of measurements and

3524
01:16:49,450 --> 01:16:49,460
measure the space of measurements and
 

3525
01:16:49,460 --> 01:16:52,930
measure the space of measurements and
you almost can and in a space that has

3526
01:16:52,930 --> 01:16:52,940
you almost can and in a space that has
 

3527
01:16:52,940 --> 01:16:55,299
you almost can and in a space that has
length and angle if it doesn't have a

3528
01:16:55,299 --> 01:16:55,309
length and angle if it doesn't have a
 

3529
01:16:55,309 --> 01:16:57,640
length and angle if it doesn't have a
topological obstruction comes with these

3530
01:16:57,640 --> 01:16:57,650
topological obstruction comes with these
 

3531
01:16:57,650 --> 01:17:01,120
topological obstruction comes with these
objects called spinners now the spinners

objects called spinners now the spinners
 

3533
01:17:01,130 --> 01:17:05,350

are the stuff of of our world we are
 

3535
01:17:05,360 --> 01:17:07,689

made of spinners they're the most
 

3537
01:17:07,699 --> 01:17:09,879
made of spinners they're the most
important really deep object that I can

01:17:09,879 --> 01:17:09,889
important really deep object that I can
 

3539
01:17:09,889 --> 01:17:11,709
important really deep object that I can
tell you about they were very surprising

3540
01:17:11,709 --> 01:17:11,719
tell you about they were very surprising
 

3541
01:17:11,719 --> 01:17:14,799
tell you about they were very surprising
what is this spinner so famously there

3542
01:17:14,799 --> 01:17:14,809
what is this spinner so famously there
 

3543
01:17:14,809 --> 01:17:19,719
what is this spinner so famously there
are these weird things that require 720

3544
01:17:19,719 --> 01:17:19,729
are these weird things that require 720
 

3545
01:17:19,729 --> 01:17:23,560
are these weird things that require 720
degrees of rotation in order to come

degrees of rotation in order to come
 

3547
01:17:23,570 --> 01:17:25,299
degrees of rotation in order to come
back to normal and that doesn't make

3548

back to normal and that doesn't make
 

3549
01:17:25,309 --> 01:17:28,330
back to normal and that doesn't make
sense and be the reason for this is that

sense and be the reason for this is that
 

3551
01:17:28,340 --> 01:17:30,850

I had the hopf fibration the part of the
problem is is that most people don't

3718
01:21:21,320 --> 01:21:21,330
problem is is that most people don't
 

3719
01:21:21,330 --> 01:21:24,649
problem is is that most people don't
know this language about spinners

3720
01:21:24,649 --> 01:21:24,659
know this language about spinners
 

3721
01:21:24,659 --> 01:21:29,450
know this language about spinners
bundles metrics gauge fields and they're

3722
01:21:29,450 --> 01:21:29,460
bundles metrics gauge fields and they're
 

3723
01:21:29,460 --> 01:21:30,800
bundles metrics gauge fields and they're
very curious about the theory of

3724
01:21:30,800 --> 01:21:30,810
very curious about the theory of
 

3725
01:21:30,810 --> 01:21:32,149
very curious about the theory of
everything but they have no

3726
01:21:32,149 --> 01:21:32,159
everything but they have no
 

3727
01:21:32,159 --> 01:21:33,979
everything but they have no
understanding of even what we know about

01:21:33,979 --> 01:21:33,989
understanding of even what we know about
 

3729
01:21:33,989 --> 01:21:35,600
understanding of even what we know about
our own world is it hole is it a

01:21:35,600 --> 01:21:35,610
our own world is it hole is it a

hopeless pursuit so like even gauge

3732
01:21:39,320 --> 01:21:39,330
hopeless pursuit so like even gauge
 

3733
01:21:39,330 --> 01:21:41,990
hopeless pursuit so like even gauge
theory right just this I mean it seems

3734
01:21:41,990 --> 01:21:42,000
theory right just this I mean it seems
 

3735
01:21:42,000 --> 01:21:44,720
theory right just this I mean it seems
to be very inaccessible is there some

3736
01:21:44,720 --> 01:21:44,730
to be very inaccessible is there some
 

3737
01:21:44,730 --> 01:21:45,890
to be very inaccessible is there some
aspect of it that could be made

3738
01:21:45,890 --> 01:21:45,900
aspect of it that could be made
 

3739
01:21:45,900 --> 01:21:47,540
aspect of it that could be made
accessible I'm actually go to the board

3740
01:21:47,540 --> 01:21:47,550
accessible I'm actually go to the board
 

3741
01:21:47,550 --> 01:21:50,240
accessible I'm actually go to the board
right there and give you a five minute

3742
01:21:50,240 --> 01:21:50,250
right there and give you a five minute
 

3743
01:21:50,250 --> 01:21:51,740
right there and give you a five minute
lecture on engaged theory that would be

3744
01:21:51,740 --> 01:21:51,750
lecture on engaged theory that would be
 

3745
01:21:51,750 --> 01:21:54,860
lecture on engaged theory that would be
better than the official lecture engaged

3746
01:21:54,860 --> 01:21:54,870
better than the official lecture engaged
 

3747
01:21:54,870 --> 01:21:56,589
better than the official lecture engaged
there you would know what gauge there

3748
01:21:56,589 --> 01:21:56,599
there you would know what gauge there
 

3749
01:21:56,599 --> 01:21:59,109
there you would know what gauge there
was so it is it's possible to make it

3750
01:21:59,109 --> 01:21:59,119
was so it is it's possible to make it
 

3751
01:21:59,119 --> 01:22:02,259
was so it is it's possible to make it
accessible yeah but nobody does like in

3752
01:22:02,259 --> 01:22:02,269
accessible yeah but nobody does like in
 

3753
01:22:02,269 --> 01:22:04,119
accessible yeah but nobody does like in
other words you're gonna watch over the

3754
01:22:04,119 --> 01:22:04,129
other words you're gonna watch over the
 

3755
01:22:04,129 --> 01:22:06,790
other words you're gonna watch over the
next year lots of different discussions

3756
01:22:06,790 --> 01:22:06,800
next year lots of different discussions
 

3757
01:22:06,800 --> 01:22:08,979
next year lots of different discussions
of a quantum entanglement or you know

3758
01:22:08,979 --> 01:22:08,989
of a quantum entanglement or you know
 

3759
01:22:08,989 --> 01:22:11,709
of a quantum entanglement or you know
the multiverse where are we now

3760
01:22:11,709 --> 01:22:11,719
the multiverse where are we now
 

3761
01:22:11,719 --> 01:22:14,049
the multiverse where are we now
right or you know many worlds are they

3762
01:22:14,049 --> 01:22:14,059
right or you know many worlds are they
 

3763
01:22:14,059 --> 01:22:18,250
right or you know many worlds are they
all equally real yeah did that right I

3764
01:22:18,250 --> 01:22:18,260
all equally real yeah did that right I
 

3765
01:22:18,260 --> 01:22:20,020
all equally real yeah did that right I
mean yeah that that's it but you're not

3766
01:22:20,020 --> 01:22:20,030
mean yeah that that's it but you're not
 

3767
01:22:20,030 --> 01:22:21,369
mean yeah that that's it but you're not
gonna hear anything about the hopf

3768
01:22:21,369 --> 01:22:21,379
gonna hear anything about the hopf
 

3769
01:22:21,379 --> 01:22:23,469
gonna hear anything about the hopf
fibration except if it's from me and I

3770
01:22:23,469 --> 01:22:23,479
fibration except if it's from me and I
 

3771
01:22:23,479 --> 01:22:26,290
fibration except if it's from me and I
hate that why why can't you be the one

3772
01:22:26,290 --> 01:22:26,300
hate that why why can't you be the one
 

3773
01:22:26,300 --> 01:22:28,750
hate that why why can't you be the one
but because I'm going a different path I

3774
01:22:28,750 --> 01:22:28,760
but because I'm going a different path I
 

3775
01:22:28,760 --> 01:22:30,069
but because I'm going a different path I
think that we've made a huge mistake

3776
01:22:30,069 --> 01:22:30,079
think that we've made a huge mistake
 

3777
01:22:30,079 --> 01:22:32,290
think that we've made a huge mistake
which is we have things we can show

3778
01:22:32,290 --> 01:22:32,300
which is we have things we can show
 

3779
01:22:32,300 --> 01:22:34,750
which is we have things we can show
people about the actual models we can

3780
01:22:34,750 --> 01:22:34,760
people about the actual models we can
 

3781
01:22:34,760 --> 01:22:36,849
people about the actual models we can
push out visualizations where they

3782
01:22:36,849 --> 01:22:36,859
push out visualizations where they
 

3783
01:22:36,859 --> 01:22:38,830
push out visualizations where they
they're not listening my analogy they're

3784
01:22:38,830 --> 01:22:38,840
they're not listening my analogy they're
 

3785
01:22:38,840 --> 01:22:40,359
they're not listening my analogy they're
watching the same thing that we're

3786
01:22:40,359 --> 01:22:40,369
watching the same thing that we're
 

3787
01:22:40,369 --> 01:22:42,459
watching the same thing that we're
seeing and as I've said to you before

3788
01:22:42,459 --> 01:22:42,469
seeing and as I've said to you before
 

3789
01:22:42,469 --> 01:22:45,580
seeing and as I've said to you before
this is like choosing to perform sheet

3790
01:22:45,580 --> 01:22:45,590
this is like choosing to perform sheet
 

3791
01:22:45,590 --> 01:22:47,319
this is like choosing to perform sheet
music that hasn't been performed in a

music that hasn't been performed in a
 

3793
01:22:47,329 --> 01:22:49,599
music that hasn't been performed in a
long time or you know the experts can't

3794
01:22:49,599 --> 01:22:49,609
long time or you know the experts can't
 

3795
01:22:49,609 --> 01:22:51,069
long time or you know the experts can't
afford orchestras so they just trade

3796
01:22:51,069 --> 01:22:51,079
afford orchestras so they just trade
 

3797
01:22:51,079 --> 01:22:53,589

Beethoven symphonies and as sheet music
and they oh wow that was beautiful but

3800
01:22:55,989 --> 01:22:55,999
and they oh wow that was beautiful but
 

3801
01:22:55,999 --> 01:22:58,479
and they oh wow that was beautiful but
it's like nobody heard anything they

3802
01:22:58,479 --> 01:22:58,489
it's like nobody heard anything they
 

3803
01:22:58,489 --> 01:23:00,669
it's like nobody heard anything they
just looked at the score well that's how

3804
01:23:00,669 --> 01:23:00,679
just looked at the score well that's how

mathematicians and physicists trade

3806
01:23:02,259 --> 01:23:02,269
mathematicians and physicists trade
 

3807
01:23:02,269 --> 01:23:05,109
mathematicians and physicists trade
papers and ideas is that they they write

3808
01:23:05,109 --> 01:23:05,119
papers and ideas is that they they write
 

3809
01:23:05,119 --> 01:23:07,799
papers and ideas is that they they write
down the things that represent stuff I

01:23:07,799 --> 01:23:07,809
down the things that represent stuff I
 

3811
01:23:07,809 --> 01:23:10,689
down the things that represent stuff I
want to at least close out the thought

3812
01:23:10,689 --> 01:23:10,699
want to at least close out the thought
 

3813
01:23:10,699 --> 01:23:13,750
want to at least close out the thought
line that you started yes which is how

does the canvas order all of this other

3816
01:23:18,699 --> 01:23:18,709
does the canvas order all of this other
 

3817
01:23:18,709 --> 01:23:22,239
does the canvas order all of this other
stuff into being so I at least like I

3818
01:23:22,239 --> 01:23:22,249
stuff into being so I at least like I
 

3819
01:23:22,249 --> 01:23:23,949
stuff into being so I at least like I
say some incomprehensible things about

3820
01:23:23,949 --> 01:23:23,959
say some incomprehensible things about
 

3821
01:23:23,959 --> 01:23:25,599
say some incomprehensible things about
that and then we'll we'll have that much

3822
01:23:25,599 --> 01:23:25,609
that and then we'll we'll have that much
 

3823
01:23:25,609 --> 01:23:30,279
that and then we'll we'll have that much
done all right and that just point does

3824
01:23:30,279 --> 01:23:30,289
done all right and that just point does
 

3825
01:23:30,289 --> 01:23:32,979
done all right and that just point does
it have to be incomprehensible do you

3826
01:23:32,979 --> 01:23:32,989
it have to be incomprehensible do you
 

3827
01:23:32,989 --> 01:23:34,299
it have to be incomprehensible do you
know what the Schrodinger equation is

3828
01:23:34,299 --> 01:23:34,309
know what the Schrodinger equation is
 

3829
01:23:34,309 --> 01:23:36,369
know what the Schrodinger equation is
yes do you know what the Dirac equation

3830
01:23:36,369 --> 01:23:36,379
yes do you know what the Dirac equation
 

3831
01:23:36,379 --> 01:23:40,839
yes do you know what the Dirac equation
is what does know mean well my point is

3832
01:23:40,839 --> 01:23:40,849
is what does know mean well my point is
 

3833
01:23:40,849 --> 01:23:42,879
is what does know mean well my point is
you're gonna have some feeling that you

3834
01:23:42,879 --> 01:23:42,889
you're gonna have some feeling that you
 

3835
01:23:42,889 --> 01:23:44,439
you're gonna have some feeling that you
know what the Schrodinger equation yes

3836
01:23:44,439 --> 01:23:44,449
know what the Schrodinger equation yes
 

3837
01:23:44,449 --> 01:23:46,439
know what the Schrodinger equation yes
as soon as we get to the Dirac equation

3838
01:23:46,439 --> 01:23:46,449
as soon as we get to the Dirac equation
 

3839
01:23:46,449 --> 01:23:48,339
as soon as we get to the Dirac equation
your eyes are gonna get a little bit

3840
01:23:48,339 --> 01:23:48,349
your eyes are gonna get a little bit
 

3841
01:23:48,349 --> 01:23:54,129
your eyes are gonna get a little bit
glazed right so now why is that well the

3842
01:23:54,129 --> 01:23:54,139
glazed right so now why is that well the
 

3843
01:23:54,139 --> 01:23:58,359
glazed right so now why is that well the
answer to me this is that you you want

3844
01:23:58,359 --> 01:23:58,369
answer to me this is that you you want
 

3845
01:23:58,369 --> 01:24:01,020
answer to me this is that you you want
to ask me about the theory of everything

3846
01:24:01,020 --> 01:24:01,030
to ask me about the theory of everything
 

3847
01:24:01,030 --> 01:24:04,839
to ask me about the theory of everything
but you haven't even digest the theory

3848
01:24:04,839 --> 01:24:04,849
but you haven't even digest the theory
 

3849
01:24:04,849 --> 01:24:07,439
but you haven't even digest the theory
of everything as we've had it since 1928

3850
01:24:07,439 --> 01:24:07,449
of everything as we've had it since 1928
 

3851
01:24:07,449 --> 01:24:11,399
of everything as we've had it since 1928
when Dirac came out with his equation

3852
01:24:11,399 --> 01:24:11,409
when Dirac came out with his equation
 

3853
01:24:11,409 --> 01:24:15,040
when Dirac came out with his equation
so for whatever reason and this isn't a

3854
01:24:15,040 --> 01:24:15,050
so for whatever reason and this isn't a
 

3855
01:24:15,050 --> 01:24:16,859
so for whatever reason and this isn't a
hit on you yeah

3856
01:24:16,859 --> 01:24:16,869
hit on you yeah
 

3857
01:24:16,869 --> 01:24:20,140
hit on you yeah
you haven't been motivated enough in all

3858
01:24:20,140 --> 01:24:20,150
you haven't been motivated enough in all
 

3859
01:24:20,150 --> 01:24:22,510
you haven't been motivated enough in all
the time that you've been on earth to at

3860
01:24:22,510 --> 01:24:22,520
the time that you've been on earth to at
 

3861
01:24:22,520 --> 01:24:23,890
the time that you've been on earth to at
least get as far as the Dirac equation

3862
01:24:23,890 --> 01:24:23,900
least get as far as the Dirac equation
 

3863
01:24:23,900 --> 01:24:25,780
least get as far as the Dirac equation
and this was very interesting to me

3864
01:24:25,780 --> 01:24:25,790
and this was very interesting to me
 

3865
01:24:25,790 --> 01:24:27,939
and this was very interesting to me
after I gave the talk in Oxford New

3866
01:24:27,939 --> 01:24:27,949
after I gave the talk in Oxford New
 

3867
01:24:27,949 --> 01:24:31,390
after I gave the talk in Oxford New
Scientist who'd done kind of a hatchet

01:24:31,400 --> 01:24:33,490
Scientist who'd done kind of a hatchet
job on me to begin with sent a reporter

3870
01:24:33,490 --> 01:24:33,500
job on me to begin with sent a reporter
 

3871
01:24:33,500 --> 01:24:35,109
job on me to begin with sent a reporter
to come to the third version of the talk

3872
01:24:35,109 --> 01:24:35,119
to come to the third version of the talk
 

3873
01:24:35,119 --> 01:24:38,020
to come to the third version of the talk
that I gave and that person had never

3874
01:24:38,020 --> 01:24:38,030
that I gave and that person had never
 

3875
01:24:38,030 --> 01:24:41,530
that I gave and that person had never
heard of the Dirac equation so you have

3876
01:24:41,530 --> 01:24:41,540
heard of the Dirac equation so you have
 

3877
01:24:41,540 --> 01:24:43,810
heard of the Dirac equation so you have
a person who was completely

3878
01:24:43,810 --> 01:24:43,820
a person who was completely
 

3879
01:24:43,820 --> 01:24:46,810
a person who was completely
professionally not qualified to ask

3880
01:24:46,810 --> 01:24:46,820
professionally not qualified to ask
 

3881
01:24:46,820 --> 01:24:51,220
professionally not qualified to ask
these questions wanting to know well how

3882
01:24:51,220 --> 01:24:51,230
these questions wanting to know well how
 

3883
01:24:51,230 --> 01:24:53,169
these questions wanting to know well how
does how does your theory solve new

3884
01:24:53,169 --> 01:24:53,179
does how does your theory solve new
 

3885
01:24:53,179 --> 01:24:55,450
does how does your theory solve new
problems like well in the case of the

3886
01:24:55,450 --> 01:24:55,460
problems like well in the case of the
 

3887
01:24:55,460 --> 01:24:56,890
problems like well in the case of the
Dirac equation well tell me about that I

3888
01:24:56,890 --> 01:24:56,900
Dirac equation well tell me about that I
 

3889
01:24:56,900 --> 01:24:58,419
Dirac equation well tell me about that I
don't know what that is so then the

3890
01:24:58,419 --> 01:24:58,429
don't know what that is so then the
 

3891
01:24:58,429 --> 01:25:00,330
don't know what that is so then the
point is okay I got it

3892
01:25:00,330 --> 01:25:00,340
point is okay I got it
 

3893
01:25:00,340 --> 01:25:04,180
point is okay I got it
you're not even caught up minimally to

3894
01:25:04,180 --> 01:25:04,190
you're not even caught up minimally to
 

3895
01:25:04,190 --> 01:25:06,160
you're not even caught up minimally to
where we are now and that's not a knock

3896
01:25:06,160 --> 01:25:06,170
where we are now and that's not a knock
 

3897
01:25:06,170 --> 01:25:09,189
where we are now and that's not a knock
on you almost nobody is yeah but how

3898
01:25:09,189 --> 01:25:09,199
on you almost nobody is yeah but how
 

3899
01:25:09,199 --> 01:25:12,370
on you almost nobody is yeah but how
does it become my job to digest what has

3900
01:25:12,370 --> 01:25:12,380
does it become my job to digest what has
 

3901
01:25:12,380 --> 01:25:17,100
does it become my job to digest what has
been available for like over 90 years

3902
01:25:17,100 --> 01:25:17,110
been available for like over 90 years
 

3903
01:25:17,110 --> 01:25:20,169
been available for like over 90 years
well to me the open question is whether

3904
01:25:20,169 --> 01:25:20,179
well to me the open question is whether
 

3905
01:25:20,179 --> 01:25:21,910
well to me the open question is whether
what's been available for over 90 years

3906
01:25:21,910 --> 01:25:21,920
what's been available for over 90 years
 

3907
01:25:21,920 --> 01:25:28,689
what's been available for over 90 years
can be there could be a a blueprint of a

3908
01:25:28,689 --> 01:25:28,699
can be there could be a a blueprint of a
 

3909
01:25:28,699 --> 01:25:30,790
can be there could be a a blueprint of a
journey that one takes to understand it

3910
01:25:30,790 --> 01:25:30,800
journey that one takes to understand it
 

3911
01:25:30,800 --> 01:25:33,160
journey that one takes to understand it
not oh I want to do that with you and I

3912
01:25:33,160 --> 01:25:33,170
not oh I want to do that with you and I
 

3913
01:25:33,170 --> 01:25:35,229
not oh I want to do that with you and I
I one of the things I think I've been

3914
01:25:35,229 --> 01:25:35,239
I one of the things I think I've been
 

3915
01:25:35,239 --> 01:25:38,770
I one of the things I think I've been
relatively successful at for example you

3916
01:25:38,770 --> 01:25:38,780
relatively successful at for example you
 

3917
01:25:38,780 --> 01:25:39,910
relatively successful at for example you
know when you ask other people what

3918
01:25:39,910 --> 01:25:39,920
know when you ask other people what
 

3919
01:25:39,920 --> 01:25:42,399
know when you ask other people what
gauge theory is you get these very

3920
01:25:42,399 --> 01:25:42,409
gauge theory is you get these very
 

3921
01:25:42,409 --> 01:25:45,220
gauge theory is you get these very
confusing responses and my response is

3922
01:25:45,220 --> 01:25:45,230
confusing responses and my response is
 

3923
01:25:45,230 --> 01:25:47,760
confusing responses and my response is
much simpler it's oh it's a theory of

3924
01:25:47,760 --> 01:25:47,770
much simpler it's oh it's a theory of
 

3925
01:25:47,770 --> 01:25:50,109
much simpler it's oh it's a theory of
differentiation where when you calculate

3926
01:25:50,109 --> 01:25:50,119
differentiation where when you calculate
 

3927
01:25:50,119 --> 01:25:52,570
differentiation where when you calculate
the instantaneous rise over run you

3928
01:25:52,570 --> 01:25:52,580
the instantaneous rise over run you
 

3929
01:25:52,580 --> 01:25:54,640
the instantaneous rise over run you
measure the rise not from a flat

3930
01:25:54,640 --> 01:25:54,650
measure the rise not from a flat
 

3931
01:25:54,650 --> 01:25:56,919
measure the rise not from a flat
horizontal but from a custom endogenous

3932
01:25:56,919 --> 01:25:56,929
horizontal but from a custom endogenous
 

3933
01:25:56,929 --> 01:26:00,010
horizontal but from a custom endogenous
reference level what do you mean by that

3934
01:26:00,010 --> 01:26:00,020
reference level what do you mean by that
 

3935
01:26:00,020 --> 01:26:01,660
reference level what do you mean by that
it's like okay and then I do this thing

3936
01:26:01,660 --> 01:26:01,670
it's like okay and then I do this thing
 

3937
01:26:01,670 --> 01:26:04,240
it's like okay and then I do this thing
with Mount Everest which is man Everest

3938
01:26:04,240 --> 01:26:04,250
with Mount Everest which is man Everest
 

3939
01:26:04,250 --> 01:26:06,220
with Mount Everest which is man Everest
is how high then they give the height I

3940
01:26:06,220 --> 01:26:06,230
is how high then they give the height I
 

3941
01:26:06,230 --> 01:26:07,899
is how high then they give the height I
say above what then they say sea level

3942
01:26:07,899 --> 01:26:07,909
say above what then they say sea level
 

3943
01:26:07,909 --> 01:26:10,390
say above what then they say sea level
and I say which sea is that in Nepal

3944
01:26:10,390 --> 01:26:10,400
and I say which sea is that in Nepal
 

3945
01:26:10,400 --> 01:26:12,010
and I say which sea is that in Nepal
like oh I guess there isn't a sea cuz

3946
01:26:12,010 --> 01:26:12,020
like oh I guess there isn't a sea cuz
 

3947
01:26:12,020 --> 01:26:14,020
like oh I guess there isn't a sea cuz
it's landlocked it's like okay well what

3948
01:26:14,020 --> 01:26:14,030
it's landlocked it's like okay well what
 

3949
01:26:14,030 --> 01:26:15,430
it's landlocked it's like okay well what
do you mean by sea level oh there's this

3950
01:26:15,430 --> 01:26:15,440
do you mean by sea level oh there's this
 

3951
01:26:15,440 --> 01:26:17,140
do you mean by sea level oh there's this
thing called the geoid I'd never heard

3952
01:26:17,140 --> 01:26:17,150
thing called the geoid I'd never heard
 

3953
01:26:17,150 --> 01:26:19,450
thing called the geoid I'd never heard
of oh that's the reference level it's a

3954
01:26:19,450 --> 01:26:19,460
of oh that's the reference level it's a
 

3955
01:26:19,460 --> 01:26:22,189
of oh that's the reference level it's a
custom reference level that we imported

3956
01:26:22,189 --> 01:26:22,199
custom reference level that we imported
 

3957
01:26:22,199 --> 01:26:24,459
custom reference level that we imported
so you all sorts of people have

3958
01:26:24,459 --> 01:26:24,469
so you all sorts of people have
 

3959
01:26:24,469 --> 01:26:27,589
so you all sorts of people have
remembered the exact height of Mount

3960
01:26:27,589 --> 01:26:27,599
remembered the exact height of Mount
 

3961
01:26:27,599 --> 01:26:29,839
remembered the exact height of Mount
Everest without ever knowing what it's a

3962
01:26:29,839 --> 01:26:29,849
Everest without ever knowing what it's a
 

3963
01:26:29,849 --> 01:26:33,589
Everest without ever knowing what it's a
height from well in this case in gauge

3964
01:26:33,589 --> 01:26:33,599
height from well in this case in gauge
 

3965
01:26:33,599 --> 01:26:35,689
height from well in this case in gauge
Theory there's a hidden reference level

Theory there's a hidden reference level
 

3967
01:26:35,699 --> 01:26:37,759

4177
01:31:07,980 --> 01:31:10,459
quantum field theory I can't I I don't
know how you would do that the the hope

4178
01:31:10,459 --> 01:31:10,469
know how you would do that the the hope
 

4179
01:31:10,469 --> 01:31:14,470
know how you would do that the the hope
for me is that there's some simple

4180
01:31:14,470 --> 01:31:14,480
for me is that there's some simple
 

4181
01:31:14,480 --> 01:31:17,300
for me is that there's some simple
explanations for all of it Lex should we

4182
01:31:17,300 --> 01:31:17,310
explanations for all of it Lex should we
 

4183
01:31:17,310 --> 01:31:20,840
explanations for all of it Lex should we
have a drink you're having fun no I'm

4184
01:31:20,840 --> 01:31:20,850
have a drink you're having fun no I'm
 

4185
01:31:20,850 --> 01:31:22,850
have a drink you're having fun no I'm
trying to have fun with you you know I

4186
01:31:22,850 --> 01:31:22,860
trying to have fun with you you know I
 

4187
01:31:22,860 --> 01:31:26,479
trying to have fun with you you know I
had there's a bunch of fun things to

4188
01:31:26,479 --> 01:31:26,489
had there's a bunch of fun things to
 

4189
01:31:26,489 --> 01:31:29,720
had there's a bunch of fun things to
talk about here anyway that was how I

4190
01:31:29,720 --> 01:31:29,730
talk about here anyway that was how I
 

4191
01:31:29,730 --> 01:31:33,640
talk about here anyway that was how I
got what I thought you wanted which is

4192
01:31:33,640 --> 01:31:33,650
got what I thought you wanted which is
 

4193
01:31:33,650 --> 01:31:37,040
got what I thought you wanted which is
if you think about the fermions as the

4194
01:31:37,040 --> 01:31:37,050
if you think about the fermions as the
 

4195
01:31:37,050 --> 01:31:41,540
if you think about the fermions as the
artists and the bosons as the brushes

4196
01:31:41,540 --> 01:31:41,550
artists and the bosons as the brushes
 

4197
01:31:41,550 --> 01:31:44,600
artists and the bosons as the brushes
and the paint what I told you is that's

4198
01:31:44,600 --> 01:31:44,610
and the paint what I told you is that's
 

4199
01:31:44,610 --> 01:31:48,380
and the paint what I told you is that's
how we get the artists what are the open

4200
01:31:48,380 --> 01:31:48,390
how we get the artists what are the open
 

4201
01:31:48,390 --> 01:31:51,080
how we get the artists what are the open
questions for you in this what were the

4202
01:31:51,080 --> 01:31:51,090
questions for you in this what were the
 

4203
01:31:51,090 --> 01:31:53,780
questions for you in this what were the
challenges so you're not done well

4204
01:31:53,780 --> 01:31:53,790
challenges so you're not done well
 

4205
01:31:53,790 --> 01:31:55,760
challenges so you're not done well
there's the things that I would like to

4206
01:31:55,760 --> 01:31:55,770
there's the things that I would like to
 

4207
01:31:55,770 --> 01:31:58,280
there's the things that I would like to
have in better order so a lot of people

4208
01:31:58,280 --> 01:31:58,290
have in better order so a lot of people
 

4209
01:31:58,290 --> 01:32:02,390
have in better order so a lot of people
will say see the reason I hesitated on

4210
01:32:02,390 --> 01:32:02,400
will say see the reason I hesitated on
 

4211
01:32:02,400 --> 01:32:03,919
will say see the reason I hesitated on
this is I just have a totally different

4212
01:32:03,919 --> 01:32:03,929
this is I just have a totally different
 

4213
01:32:03,929 --> 01:32:05,990
this is I just have a totally different
view than the community so for example I

4214
01:32:05,990 --> 01:32:06,000
view than the community so for example I
 

4215
01:32:06,000 --> 01:32:09,490
view than the community so for example I
believe that general relativity began in

4216
01:32:09,490 --> 01:32:09,500
believe that general relativity began in
 

4217
01:32:09,500 --> 01:32:14,149
believe that general relativity began in
1913 with Einstein and Grossman now that

4218
01:32:14,149 --> 01:32:14,159
1913 with Einstein and Grossman now that
 

4219
01:32:14,159 --> 01:32:16,870
1913 with Einstein and Grossman now that
was the first of like four major papers

4220
01:32:16,870 --> 01:32:16,880
was the first of like four major papers
 

4221
01:32:16,880 --> 01:32:20,330
was the first of like four major papers
in this line of thinking to most

4222
01:32:20,330 --> 01:32:20,340
in this line of thinking to most
 

4223
01:32:20,340 --> 01:32:23,120
in this line of thinking to most
physicists general relativity happened

4224
01:32:23,120 --> 01:32:23,130
physicists general relativity happened
 

4225
01:32:23,130 --> 01:32:30,610
physicists general relativity happened
when Einstein produced a divergence free

4226
01:32:30,610 --> 01:32:30,620
when Einstein produced a divergence free
 

4227
01:32:30,620 --> 01:32:32,660
when Einstein produced a divergence free
gradient which turned out to be the

4228
01:32:32,660 --> 01:32:32,670
gradient which turned out to be the
 

4229
01:32:32,670 --> 01:32:35,120
gradient which turned out to be the
gradient of the so-called Hilbert or

4230
01:32:35,120 --> 01:32:35,130
gradient of the so-called Hilbert or
 

4231
01:32:35,130 --> 01:32:38,689
gradient of the so-called Hilbert or
Einstein Hilbert action and from my

4232
01:32:38,689 --> 01:32:38,699
Einstein Hilbert action and from my
 

4233
01:32:38,699 --> 01:32:40,610
Einstein Hilbert action and from my
perspective that wasn't true is is that

4234
01:32:40,610 --> 01:32:40,620
perspective that wasn't true is is that
 

4235
01:32:40,620 --> 01:32:42,530
perspective that wasn't true is is that
it began when Einstein said look this is

4236
01:32:42,530 --> 01:32:42,540
it began when Einstein said look this is
 

4237
01:32:42,540 --> 01:32:47,000
it began when Einstein said look this is
about differential geometry and it's the

4238
01:32:47,000 --> 01:32:47,010
about differential geometry and it's the
 

4239
01:32:47,010 --> 01:32:48,709
about differential geometry and it's the
final answer is going to look like a

4240
01:32:48,709 --> 01:32:48,719
final answer is going to look like a
 

4241
01:32:48,719 --> 01:32:52,250
final answer is going to look like a
curvature tensor on one side and matter

4242
01:32:52,250 --> 01:32:52,260
curvature tensor on one side and matter
 

4243
01:32:52,260 --> 01:32:54,649
curvature tensor on one side and matter
and energy on the other side and that

4244
01:32:54,649 --> 01:32:54,659
and energy on the other side and that
 

4245
01:32:54,659 --> 01:32:56,720
and energy on the other side and that
was enough and then he published a wrong

4246
01:32:56,720 --> 01:32:56,730
was enough and then he published a wrong
 

4247
01:32:56,730 --> 01:32:59,540
was enough and then he published a wrong
of it where it was the Ricci tensor not

4248
01:32:59,540 --> 01:32:59,550
of it where it was the Ricci tensor not
 

4249
01:32:59,550 --> 01:33:01,310
of it where it was the Ricci tensor not
the Einstein tensor then he corrected

4250
01:33:01,310 --> 01:33:01,320
the Einstein tensor then he corrected
 

4251
01:33:01,320 --> 01:33:03,290
the Einstein tensor then he corrected
the reach the Ricci tensor to make it

4252
01:33:03,290 --> 01:33:03,300
the reach the Ricci tensor to make it
 

4253
01:33:03,300 --> 01:33:04,910
the reach the Ricci tensor to make it
into the Einstein tensor then he

4254
01:33:04,910 --> 01:33:04,920
into the Einstein tensor then he
 

4255
01:33:04,920 --> 01:33:06,350
into the Einstein tensor then he
corrected that to add a cosmological

4256
01:33:06,350 --> 01:33:06,360
corrected that to add a cosmological
 

4257
01:33:06,360 --> 01:33:10,280
corrected that to add a cosmological

community thinks in those terms there's
 

4261
01:33:12,810 --> 01:33:15,320

some things about which like that
 

4263
01:33:15,330 --> 01:33:16,220
some things about which like that
there's a question about which

there's a question about which
 

4265
01:33:16,230 --> 01:33:18,560
there's a question about which
contraction do I use there's an Einstein

then you start using a lot of words that

4288
01:33:52,370 --> 01:33:52,380
then you start using a lot of words that
 

4289
01:33:52,380 --> 01:33:56,420
then you start using a lot of words that
I don't understand and like I might know

01:33:56,420 --> 01:33:56,430
I don't understand and like I might know
 

4291
01:33:56,430 --> 01:34:00,170
I don't understand and like I might know
them but I don't understand and what's

01:34:04,860 --> 01:34:08,180
listening to those words or if it's just
if this is one of those technical things

4298
01:34:08,180 --> 01:34:08,190
if this is one of those technical things
 

4299
01:34:08,190 --> 01:34:10,220
if this is one of those technical things
that's intended for a very small

that's intended for a very small
 

4301
01:34:10,230 --> 01:34:13,430
that's intended for a very small

community or if I'm supposed to actually
 

4303
01:34:13,440 --> 01:34:16,330
community or if I'm supposed to actually
take those words and start you know a

4304
01:34:16,330 --> 01:34:16,340
take those words and start you know a
 

4305
01:34:16,340 --> 01:34:20,210
take those words and start you know a
multi-year study not not a serious study

multi-year study not not a serious study
 

4307
01:34:20,220 --> 01:34:22,729
multi-year study not not a serious study
but a the kind of study when you you're

4308
01:34:22,729 --> 01:34:22,739
but a the kind of study when you you're
 

4309
01:34:22,739 --> 01:34:24,380
but a the kind of study when you you're
interested in learning about machine

4310
01:34:24,380 --> 01:34:24,390
interested in learning about machine
 

4311
01:34:24,390 --> 01:34:26,060

01:35:42,160 --> 01:35:46,170
I've picked on one paragraph from Edward
Witten and I said this is the paragraph

4370
01:35:46,170 --> 01:35:46,180
Witten and I said this is the paragraph
 

4371
01:35:46,180 --> 01:35:48,330
Witten and I said this is the paragraph
if I could only take one paragraph with

if I could only take one paragraph with

if I could only take one paragraph with
me this is the one I'd take and it's

linger on a little longer what kind of
 

4489
01:38:21,620 --> 01:38:23,740
linger on a little longer what kind of
journey do you see geometric unity

4490
01:38:23,740 --> 01:38:23,750
journey do you see geometric unity
 

4491
01:38:23,750 --> 01:38:26,170
journey do you see geometric unity
taking I don't know I mean that's the

4492
01:38:26,170 --> 01:38:26,180
taking I don't know I mean that's the
 

4493
01:38:26,180 --> 01:38:27,370
taking I don't know I mean that's the
thing is that first of all the

4494
01:38:27,370 --> 01:38:27,380
thing is that first of all the
 

4495
01:38:27,380 --> 01:38:28,960
thing is that first of all the
professional community has to get very

4496
01:38:28,960 --> 01:38:28,970
professional community has to get very
 

4497
01:38:28,970 --> 01:38:30,460
professional community has to get very
angry and outraged and they have to work

4498
01:38:30,460 --> 01:38:30,470
angry and outraged and they have to work
 

4499
01:38:30,470 --> 01:38:33,070
angry and outraged and they have to work
through their feelings this is nonsense

4500
01:38:33,070 --> 01:38:33,080
through their feelings this is nonsense
 

4501
01:38:33,080 --> 01:38:35,380
through their feelings this is nonsense
this is [\h__\h] or like no wait a

4502
01:38:35,380 --> 01:38:35,390
this is [\h__\h] or like no wait a
 

4503
01:38:35,390 --> 01:38:37,450
this is [\h__\h] or like no wait a
minute this is really cool actually I

4504
01:38:37,450 --> 01:38:37,460
minute this is really cool actually I
 

4505
01:38:37,460 --> 01:38:39,100
minute this is really cool actually I
need some clarification over here so

4506
01:38:39,100 --> 01:38:39,110
need some clarification over here so
 

4507
01:38:39,110 --> 01:38:40,810
need some clarification over here so
there's going to be some sort of weird

4508
01:38:40,810 --> 01:38:40,820
there's going to be some sort of weird
 

4509
01:38:40,820 --> 01:38:43,570
there's going to be some sort of weird
coming back together process are you

4510
01:38:43,570 --> 01:38:43,580
coming back together process are you
 

4511
01:38:43,580 --> 01:38:47,470
coming back together process are you
already hearing murmurings of that it

4512
01:38:47,470 --> 01:38:47,480
already hearing murmurings of that it
 

4513
01:38:47,480 --> 01:38:49,330
already hearing murmurings of that it
was very funny officially I've seen very

4514
01:38:49,330 --> 01:38:49,340
was very funny officially I've seen very
 

4515
01:38:49,340 --> 01:38:53,560
was very funny officially I've seen very
little so it's perhaps happening quietly

4516
01:38:53,560 --> 01:38:53,570
little so it's perhaps happening quietly

01:38:57,430 --> 01:38:57,440
yeah you often talk about we need to get
 

4519
01:38:57,440 --> 01:39:01,840
yeah you often talk about we need to get
off this planet yep can I try to sneak

4520
01:39:01,840 --> 01:39:01,850
off this planet yep can I try to sneak
 

4521
01:39:01,850 --> 01:39:04,630
off this planet yep can I try to sneak
up on that by asking what in your kind

01:39:04,630 --> 01:39:04,640
up on that by asking what in your kind
 

4523
01:39:04,640 --> 01:39:06,670
up on that by asking what in your kind

that leverages the theory to do

do in a Newtonian world right you know
 

4593
01:40:29,690 --> 01:40:31,810
do in a Newtonian world right you know
like you have twin paradoxes or Lorentz

4594
01:40:31,810 --> 01:40:31,820
like you have twin paradoxes or Lorentz
 

4595

Newton what if there wasn't new stuff to
 

4603
01:40:41,090 --> 01:40:45,640
Newton what if there wasn't new stuff to
do at the next and final level so that

4604
01:40:45,640 --> 01:40:45,650
do at the next and final level so that

do at the next and final level so that
would be quite sad let me ask a silly

4606
01:40:49,270 --> 01:40:49,280
would be quite sad let me ask a silly
 

4607
01:40:49,280 --> 01:40:51,940
would be quite sad let me ask a silly
question but we'll say it with a

question but we'll say it with a
 

4609
01:40:51,950 --> 01:40:58,240
question but we'll say it with a
straight face impossible so let me

4610
01:40:58,240 --> 01:40:58,250
straight face impossible so let me
 

4611
01:40:58,250 --> 01:41:02,350
straight face impossible so let me
mention Elon Musk what are your thoughts

mention Elon Musk what are your thoughts
 

4613
01:41:02,360 --> 01:41:05,700
mention Elon Musk what are your thoughts
about he's more you're more on the

01:41:05,700 --> 01:41:05,710
about he's more you're more on the
 

4615
01:41:05,710 --> 01:41:08,620
about he's more you're more on the
physics theory side of things he's more

in the physics engineering side of
 

4619
01:41:10,310 --> 01:41:13,180
in the physics engineering side of
things in terms of SpaceX efforts what

4620
01:41:13,180 --> 01:41:13,190
things in terms of SpaceX efforts what
 

4621
01:41:13,190 --> 01:41:17,170
things in terms of SpaceX efforts what
do you think of his efforts to uh get

4622
01:41:17,170 --> 01:41:17,180
do you think of his efforts to uh get
 

4623
01:41:17,180 --> 01:41:21,580
do you think of his efforts to uh get
off this planet well I think he's the

4624
01:41:21,580 --> 01:41:21,590
off this planet well I think he's the
 

4625
01:41:21,590 --> 01:41:24,220
off this planet well I think he's the
other guy who's sent me serious about

01:41:27,130 --> 01:41:27,140
getting off this planet I think they're
 

4629
01:41:27,140 --> 01:41:28,600
getting off this planet I think they're
two of us were semi serious about

two of us were semi serious about
 

4631
01:41:28,610 --> 01:41:30,730
two of us were semi serious about
getting off the planet what do you think

4632
01:41:30,730 --> 01:41:30,740
getting off the planet what do you think
 

4633
01:41:30,740 --> 01:41:33,310
getting off the planet what do you think
about his methodology and yours when you

4634

about his methodology and yours when you

about his methodology and yours when you
look at them don't and I don't be

diversification level is too low now

4670
01:42:16,390 --> 01:42:16,400
diversification level is too low now
 

4671
01:42:16,400 --> 01:42:19,630
diversification level is too low now
there's a compatibility first of all I

4672
01:42:19,630 --> 01:42:19,640
there's a compatibility first of all I
 

4673

Mars
 

4677
01:42:21,920 --> 01:42:27,550
Mars
I think Elon is using Mars as a

4678
01:42:27,550 --> 01:42:27,560
I think Elon is using Mars as a
 

4679
01:42:27,560 --> 01:42:30,040
I think Elon is using Mars as a
narrative as a stories and to make the

4680
01:42:30,040 --> 01:42:30,050
narrative as a stories and to make the
 

4681
01:42:30,050 --> 01:42:35,980
narrative as a stories and to make the
moon jealous it makes it I think he's

4682
01:42:35,980 --> 01:42:35,990
moon jealous it makes it I think he's
 

4683
01:42:35,990 --> 01:42:38,140
moon jealous it makes it I think he's
using it as a story to organize us to

4684
01:42:38,140 --> 01:42:38,150
using it as a story to organize us to
 

4685
01:42:38,150 --> 01:42:40,540
using it as a story to organize us to
reacquaint ourselves with our need for

4686
01:42:40,540 --> 01:42:40,550
reacquaint ourselves with our need for
 

4687
01:42:40,550 --> 01:42:42,130
reacquaint ourselves with our need for
space our need to get off this planet

4688
01:42:42,130 --> 01:42:42,140
space our need to get off this planet
 

4689
01:42:42,140 --> 01:42:46,230
space our need to get off this planet
it's a concrete thing he's shown that

4690
01:42:46,230 --> 01:42:46,240
it's a concrete thing he's shown that
 

4691
01:42:46,240 --> 01:42:48,310
it's a concrete thing he's shown that
many people think that he's shown that

4692
01:42:48,310 --> 01:42:48,320
many people think that he's shown that
 

4693
01:42:48,320 --> 01:42:49,570
many people think that he's shown that
he's the most brilliant and capable

4694
01:42:49,570 --> 01:42:49,580
he's the most brilliant and capable
 

4695
01:42:49,580 --> 01:42:51,400
he's the most brilliant and capable
person on the planet I don't think

4696
01:42:51,400 --> 01:42:51,410
person on the planet I don't think
 

4697
01:42:51,410 --> 01:42:52,780
person on the planet I don't think
that's what he showed I think he showed

4698
01:42:52,780 --> 01:42:52,790
that's what he showed I think he showed
 

4699
01:42:52,790 --> 01:42:54,190
that's what he showed I think he showed
that the rest of us have forgotten our

4700
01:42:54,190 --> 01:42:54,200
that the rest of us have forgotten our
 

4701
01:42:54,200 --> 01:42:56,620
that the rest of us have forgotten our
capabilities so he's like the only guy

4702
01:42:56,620 --> 01:42:56,630
capabilities so he's like the only guy
 

4703
01:42:56,630 --> 01:42:59,380
capabilities so he's like the only guy
who has still kept the faith and is like

4704
01:42:59,380 --> 01:42:59,390
who has still kept the faith and is like
 

4705
01:42:59,390 --> 01:43:00,690
who has still kept the faith and is like
what's wrong with you people

4706
01:43:00,690 --> 01:43:00,700
what's wrong with you people
 

4707
01:43:00,700 --> 01:43:02,860
what's wrong with you people
so you think the lesson we should draw

4708
01:43:02,860 --> 01:43:02,870
so you think the lesson we should draw
 

4709
01:43:02,870 --> 01:43:06,040
so you think the lesson we should draw
from Elon Musk is there's a is a capable

4710
01:43:06,040 --> 01:43:06,050
from Elon Musk is there's a is a capable
 

4711
01:43:06,050 --> 01:43:08,170
from Elon Musk is there's a is a capable
person within within a lot of us you on

4712
01:43:08,170 --> 01:43:08,180
person within within a lot of us you on
 

4713
01:43:08,180 --> 01:43:09,250
person within within a lot of us you on
make sense to me

4714
01:43:09,250 --> 01:43:09,260
make sense to me
 

4715
01:43:09,260 --> 01:43:12,460
make sense to me
in what way he's doing what any sensible

4716
01:43:12,460 --> 01:43:12,470
in what way he's doing what any sensible
 

4717
01:43:12,470 --> 01:43:15,520
in what way he's doing what any sensible
person should do he's trying incredible

4718
01:43:15,520 --> 01:43:15,530
person should do he's trying incredible
 

4719
01:43:15,530 --> 01:43:17,710
person should do he's trying incredible
things and he's partially succeeding

4720
01:43:17,710 --> 01:43:17,720
things and he's partially succeeding
 

4721
01:43:17,720 --> 01:43:19,300
things and he's partially succeeding
partially failing to try to solve the

4722
01:43:19,300 --> 01:43:19,310
partially failing to try to solve the
 

4723
01:43:19,310 --> 01:43:21,790
partially failing to try to solve the
obvious problems before uh yeah you know

4724
01:43:21,790 --> 01:43:21,800
obvious problems before uh yeah you know
 

4725
01:43:21,800 --> 01:43:23,770
obvious problems before uh yeah you know
but he comes up with things like you

4726
01:43:23,770 --> 01:43:23,780
but he comes up with things like you

I view everyone else's insane and my
 

4741
01:43:42,530 --> 01:43:45,010
I view everyone else's insane and my
feeling is is that we really have to get

4742
01:43:45,010 --> 01:43:45,020
feeling is is that we really have to get
 

4743
01:43:45,020 --> 01:43:46,750
feeling is is that we really have to get
off this planet we have to get out of

4744
01:43:46,750 --> 01:43:46,760
off this planet we have to get out of
 

4745
01:43:46,760 --> 01:43:48,040
off this planet we have to get out of
this we have to get out of the

4746
01:43:48,040 --> 01:43:48,050
this we have to get out of the
 

4747
01:43:48,050 --> 01:43:50,680
this we have to get out of the
neighborhood tilling I know a little bit

4748
01:43:50,680 --> 01:43:50,690
neighborhood tilling I know a little bit
 

4749
01:43:50,690 --> 01:43:52,840

do you think that's a physics problem or

4750
01:43:52,840 --> 01:43:52,850
do you think that's a physics problem or
 

4751
01:43:52,850 --> 01:43:54,420
do you think that's a physics problem or
an engineering problem

4752
01:43:54,420 --> 01:43:54,430
an engineering problem
 

4753
01:43:54,430 --> 01:43:57,550
an engineering problem
he's a cowardice problem I think that

4754
01:43:57,550 --> 01:43:57,560
he's a cowardice problem I think that
 

4755
01:43:57,560 --> 01:43:59,360
he's a cowardice problem I think that
we're afraid

4756
01:43:59,360 --> 01:43:59,370
we're afraid
 

4757
01:43:59,370 --> 01:44:03,140
we're afraid
that we had 400 hitters of the mind like

4758
01:44:03,140 --> 01:44:03,150
that we had 400 hitters of the mind like
 

4759
01:44:03,150 --> 01:44:05,120
that we had 400 hitters of the mind like
Einstein in Dirac and that that era is

4760
01:44:05,120 --> 01:44:05,130
Einstein in Dirac and that that era is
 

4761
01:44:05,130 --> 01:44:08,960
Einstein in Dirac and that that era is
done and now we're just sort of copy

4762
01:44:08,960 --> 01:44:08,970
done and now we're just sort of copy
 

4763
01:44:08,970 --> 01:44:12,980
done and now we're just sort of copy
editors so some of it money like if we

4764
01:44:12,980 --> 01:44:12,990
editors so some of it money like if we
 

4765
01:44:12,990 --> 01:44:15,440
editors so some of it money like if we
become brave enough yeah go outside the

4766
01:44:15,440 --> 01:44:15,450
become brave enough yeah go outside the
 

4767
01:44:15,450 --> 01:44:17,920
become brave enough yeah go outside the
solar system can we afford to

4768
01:44:17,920 --> 01:44:17,930
solar system can we afford to
 

4769
01:44:17,930 --> 01:44:20,720
solar system can we afford to
financially well I think that's not

4770
01:44:20,720 --> 01:44:20,730
financially well I think that's not
 

4771
01:44:20,730 --> 01:44:24,890
financially well I think that's not
really the issue the issue is look what

4772
01:44:24,890 --> 01:44:24,900
really the issue the issue is look what
 

4773
01:44:24,900 --> 01:44:27,430
really the issue the issue is look what
Elon did well he amassed a lot of money

4774
01:44:27,430 --> 01:44:27,440
Elon did well he amassed a lot of money
 

4775
01:44:27,440 --> 01:44:30,770
Elon did well he amassed a lot of money
and then he you know he plowed it back

4776
01:44:30,770 --> 01:44:30,780
and then he you know he plowed it back
 

4777
01:44:30,780 --> 01:44:31,970
and then he you know he plowed it back
in and he spun

4778
01:44:31,970 --> 01:44:31,980
in and he spun
 

4779
01:44:31,980 --> 01:44:33,650
in and he spun
he spun the wheel and he made more money

4780
01:44:33,650 --> 01:44:33,660
he spun the wheel and he made more money
 

4781
01:44:33,660 --> 01:44:36,920
he spun the wheel and he made more money
and now he's got fu money now the

4782
01:44:36,920 --> 01:44:36,930
and now he's got fu money now the
 

4783
01:44:36,930 --> 01:44:40,880
and now he's got fu money now the
problem is is that a lot of the people

4784
01:44:40,880 --> 01:44:40,890
problem is is that a lot of the people
 

4785
01:44:40,890 --> 01:44:43,910
problem is is that a lot of the people
who have fu money are not people whose

4786
01:44:43,910 --> 01:44:43,920
who have fu money are not people whose
 

4787
01:44:43,920 --> 01:44:45,620
who have fu money are not people whose
middle finger you ever want to see I

4788
01:44:45,620 --> 01:44:45,630
middle finger you ever want to see I
 

4789
01:44:45,630 --> 01:44:47,680
middle finger you ever want to see I
want to see you Long's middle finger I

4791
01:44:47,690 --> 01:44:50,030
want to see you Long's middle finger I
want to see what I mean by that or like

4792
01:44:50,030 --> 01:44:50,040
want to see what I mean by that or like
 

4793
01:44:50,040 --> 01:44:51,890
want to see what I mean by that or like
when you say [\h__\h] it I'm gonna do the

that gets in his way that he can afford

4800
01:44:57,680 --> 01:44:57,690
that gets in his way that he can afford
 

4801
01:44:57,690 --> 01:44:59,540
that gets in his way that he can afford
to push out of his way and you're saying

4802
01:44:59,540 --> 01:44:59,550
to push out of his way and you're saying
 

4803
01:44:59,550 --> 01:45:01,400
to push out of his way and you're saying
he's not actually even doing that enough

4804
01:45:01,400 --> 01:45:01,410
he's not actually even doing that enough
 

4805
01:45:01,410 --> 01:45:04,100
he's not actually even doing that enough
no I mean he's not going please I want

4806

01:45:04,590 --> 01:45:07,130
to go
Elon is doing fine with his money I just

4810
01:45:07,130 --> 01:45:07,140
Elon is doing fine with his money I just
 

4811
01:45:07,140 --> 01:45:10,130
Elon is doing fine with his money I just
want him to enjoy himself have the most

4812
01:45:10,130 --> 01:45:10,140
want him to enjoy himself have the most
 

4813
01:45:10,140 --> 01:45:12,890
want him to enjoy himself have the most
you know die nice you know but you're

4814
01:45:12,890 --> 01:45:12,900
you know die nice you know but you're
 

4815
01:45:12,900 --> 01:45:16,370
you know die nice you know but you're
saying Mars is playing it safe he

4816
01:45:16,370 --> 01:45:16,380
saying Mars is playing it safe he
 

4817
01:45:16,380 --> 01:45:18,490
saying Mars is playing it safe he
doesn't know how to do anything else

4818
01:45:18,490 --> 01:45:18,500
doesn't know how to do anything else
 

4819
01:45:18,500 --> 01:45:23,360
doesn't know how to do anything else
he knows rockets yeah and he might know

4820
01:45:23,360 --> 01:45:23,370
he knows rockets yeah and he might know
 

4821
01:45:23,370 --> 01:45:28,640
he knows rockets yeah and he might know
some physics at a fundamental level yeah

4822
01:45:28,640 --> 01:45:28,650
some physics at a fundamental level yeah
 

4823
01:45:28,650 --> 01:45:31,370
some physics at a fundamental level yeah
I guess okay just let me just like go

4824
01:45:31,370 --> 01:45:31,380
I guess okay just let me just like go
 

4825
01:45:31,380 --> 01:45:33,080
I guess okay just let me just like go
right back to you how much physics do

4826
01:45:33,080 --> 01:45:33,090
right back to you how much physics do
 

4827
01:45:33,090 --> 01:45:35,840
right back to you how much physics do
you really how much brilliant

4828
01:45:35,840 --> 01:45:35,850
you really how much brilliant
 

4829
01:45:35,850 --> 01:45:37,370
you really how much brilliant
breakthrough ideas on the physics side

4830
01:45:37,370 --> 01:45:37,380
breakthrough ideas on the physics side
 

4831
01:45:37,380 --> 01:45:40,270
breakthrough ideas on the physics side
do you need to get off this planet I

4832
01:45:40,270 --> 01:45:40,280
do you need to get off this planet I
 

4833
01:45:40,280 --> 01:45:43,040
do you need to get off this planet I
don't know and I don't know whether like

4834
01:45:43,040 --> 01:45:43,050
don't know and I don't know whether like
 

4835
01:45:43,050 --> 01:45:44,840
don't know and I don't know whether like
in my most optimistic dream I don't know

4836
01:45:44,840 --> 01:45:44,850
in my most optimistic dream I don't know
 

4837
01:45:44,850 --> 01:45:46,270
in my most optimistic dream I don't know
whether my stuff gets us off the planet

4838
01:45:46,270 --> 01:45:46,280
whether my stuff gets us off the planet
 

4839
01:45:46,280 --> 01:45:49,730
whether my stuff gets us off the planet
but it's hope it's hope that there's a

4840
01:45:49,730 --> 01:45:49,740
but it's hope it's hope that there's a
 

4841
01:45:49,740 --> 01:45:51,320
but it's hope it's hope that there's a
more fundamental theory that we can

4842
01:45:51,320 --> 01:45:51,330
more fundamental theory that we can
 

4843
01:45:51,330 --> 01:45:56,030
more fundamental theory that we can
access that we don't need you know whose

4844
01:45:56,030 --> 01:45:56,040
access that we don't need you know whose
 

4845
01:45:56,040 --> 01:45:58,340
access that we don't need you know whose
elegance and beauty will suggest that

4846
01:45:58,340 --> 01:45:58,350
elegance and beauty will suggest that
 

4847
01:45:58,350 --> 01:46:00,740
elegance and beauty will suggest that
this is probably the way the universe

4848
01:46:00,740 --> 01:46:00,750
this is probably the way the universe
 

4849
01:46:00,750 --> 01:46:02,780
this is probably the way the universe
goes like you have to say this weird

4850
01:46:02,780 --> 01:46:02,790
goes like you have to say this weird
 

4851
01:46:02,790 --> 01:46:06,290
goes like you have to say this weird
thing which is this I believe and this I

4852
01:46:06,290 --> 01:46:06,300
thing which is this I believe and this I
 

4853
01:46:06,300 --> 01:46:07,790
thing which is this I believe and this I
believe is a very dangerous statement

4854
01:46:07,790 --> 01:46:07,800
believe is a very dangerous statement
 

4855
01:46:07,800 --> 01:46:11,510
believe is a very dangerous statement
but this I believe I believe that my

4856
01:46:11,510 --> 01:46:11,520
but this I believe I believe that my
 

4857
01:46:11,520 --> 01:46:12,830
but this I believe I believe that my
theory

4858
01:46:12,830 --> 01:46:12,840
theory
 

4859
01:46:12,840 --> 01:46:16,820
theory
points the way now Elon might or might

4860
01:46:16,820 --> 01:46:16,830
points the way now Elon might or might
 

4861
01:46:16,830 --> 01:46:18,979
points the way now Elon might or might
not be able to access my theory I don't

4862
01:46:18,979 --> 01:46:18,989
not be able to access my theory I don't
 

4863
01:46:18,989 --> 01:46:21,169
not be able to access my theory I don't
know I don't know what he knows but keep

4864
01:46:21,169 --> 01:46:21,179
know I don't know what he knows but keep
 

4865
01:46:21,179 --> 01:46:25,189
know I don't know what he knows but keep
in mind why are we all so focused on you

4866
01:46:25,189 --> 01:46:25,199
in mind why are we all so focused on you
 

4867
01:46:25,199 --> 01:46:26,720
in mind why are we all so focused on you
on it's really weird

4868
01:46:26,720 --> 01:46:26,730
on it's really weird
 

4869
01:46:26,730 --> 01:46:29,330
on it's really weird
it's kind of creepy to what he's just a

4870
01:46:29,330 --> 01:46:29,340
it's kind of creepy to what he's just a
 

4871
01:46:29,340 --> 01:46:31,580
it's kind of creepy to what he's just a
person who's just asking the the obvious

4872
01:46:31,580 --> 01:46:31,590
person who's just asking the the obvious
 

4873
01:46:31,590 --> 01:46:33,950
person who's just asking the the obvious
questions and doing whatever he can but

4874
01:46:33,950 --> 01:46:33,960
questions and doing whatever he can but
 

4875
01:46:33,960 --> 01:46:35,120
questions and doing whatever he can but
he makes sense to me

4876
01:46:35,120 --> 01:46:35,130
he makes sense to me
 

4877
01:46:35,130 --> 01:46:37,100
he makes sense to me
you sent craig venter makes sense to me

4878
01:46:37,100 --> 01:46:37,110
you sent craig venter makes sense to me
 

4879
01:46:37,110 --> 01:46:39,560
you sent craig venter makes sense to me
Jim Watson makes sense to me but we're

4880
01:46:39,560 --> 01:46:39,570
Jim Watson makes sense to me but we're
 

4881
01:46:39,570 --> 01:46:43,040
Jim Watson makes sense to me but we're
focusing on Elon because he's he somehow

4882
01:46:43,040 --> 01:46:43,050
focusing on Elon because he's he somehow
 

4883
01:46:43,050 --> 01:46:45,830
focusing on Elon because he's he somehow
is rare well that's the weird thing like

4884
01:46:45,830 --> 01:46:45,840
is rare well that's the weird thing like
 

4885
01:46:45,840 --> 01:46:47,390
is rare well that's the weird thing like
we've come up with a system that

4886
01:46:47,390 --> 01:46:47,400
we've come up with a system that
 

4887
01:46:47,400 --> 01:46:50,810
we've come up with a system that
eliminates all Elon from our pipeline

4888
01:46:50,810 --> 01:46:50,820
eliminates all Elon from our pipeline
 

4889
01:46:50,820 --> 01:46:55,790
eliminates all Elon from our pipeline
and Elon somehow snuck through when they

4890
01:46:55,790 --> 01:46:55,800
and Elon somehow snuck through when they
 

4891
01:46:55,800 --> 01:46:57,500
and Elon somehow snuck through when they
were quality adjusting everything you

4892
01:46:57,500 --> 01:46:57,510
were quality adjusting everything you
 

4893
01:46:57,510 --> 01:47:02,180
were quality adjusting everything you
know and this this idea of of disk I

4894
01:47:02,180 --> 01:47:02,190
know and this this idea of of disk I
 

4895
01:47:02,190 --> 01:47:04,640

yeah is that what's bringing the in-laws

4898
01:47:08,030 --> 01:47:08,040
yeah is that what's bringing the in-laws
 

4899
01:47:08,040 --> 01:47:11,089
yeah is that what's bringing the in-laws
of the world down you know so funny it's

4900
01:47:11,089 --> 01:47:11,099
of the world down you know so funny it's
 

4901

like he's asking Joe Rogan like is that

4902
01:47:13,220 --> 01:47:13,230
like he's asking Joe Rogan like is that
 

4903
01:47:13,230 --> 01:47:15,530
like he's asking Joe Rogan like is that
a joint you know it's like well what

4904
01:47:15,530 --> 01:47:15,540
a joint you know it's like well what
 

4905
01:47:15,540 --> 01:47:16,850
a joint you know it's like well what
will happen if I smoke it what will

4906
01:47:16,850 --> 01:47:16,860
will happen if I smoke it what will
 

4907
01:47:16,860 --> 01:47:18,649
will happen if I smoke it what will
happen to the stock price what will

4908
01:47:18,649 --> 01:47:18,659
happen to the stock price what will
 

4909
01:47:18,659 --> 01:47:20,839
happen to the stock price what will
happen if I scratch myself in public

4910
01:47:20,839 --> 01:47:20,849
happen if I scratch myself in public
 

4911
01:47:20,849 --> 01:47:22,850
happen if I scratch myself in public
what will happen if I say what I think

4912
01:47:22,850 --> 01:47:22,860
what will happen if I say what I think
 

4913
01:47:22,860 --> 01:47:26,270
what will happen if I say what I think
about Thailand or kovat or who knows

4914
01:47:26,270 --> 01:47:26,280
about Thailand or kovat or who knows
 

4915
01:47:26,280 --> 01:47:28,310
about Thailand or kovat or who knows
what and everybody's like don't say that

4916
01:47:28,310 --> 01:47:28,320
what and everybody's like don't say that
 

4917
01:47:28,320 --> 01:47:31,250
what and everybody's like don't say that
say this go do this go do that well it's

4918
01:47:31,250 --> 01:47:31,260
say this go do this go do that well it's
 

4919
01:47:31,260 --> 01:47:34,189
say this go do this go do that well it's
crazy-making it's absolutely crazy

4920
01:47:34,189 --> 01:47:34,199
crazy-making it's absolutely crazy
 

4921
01:47:34,199 --> 01:47:36,290
crazy-making it's absolutely crazy
making and if you think about what we

4922
01:47:36,290 --> 01:47:36,300
making and if you think about what we
 

4923
01:47:36,300 --> 01:47:42,410
making and if you think about what we
put through people through we need to

4924
01:47:42,410 --> 01:47:42,420
put through people through we need to
 

4925
01:47:42,420 --> 01:47:45,500
put through people through we need to
get people who can use fu money the fu

4926
01:47:45,500 --> 01:47:45,510
get people who can use fu money the fu
 

4927
01:47:45,510 --> 01:47:47,510
get people who can use fu money the fu
money they need to insulate themselves

4928
01:47:47,510 --> 01:47:47,520
money they need to insulate themselves
 

4929
01:47:47,520 --> 01:47:50,390
money they need to insulate themselves
from all of the people who know better

4930
01:47:50,390 --> 01:47:50,400
from all of the people who know better
 

4931
01:47:50,400 --> 01:47:54,470
from all of the people who know better
because the my nightmare is is that why

4932
01:47:54,470 --> 01:47:54,480
because the my nightmare is is that why
 

4933
01:47:54,480 --> 01:47:56,540
because the my nightmare is is that why
did we only get one ilan what if we were

4934
01:47:56,540 --> 01:47:56,550
did we only get one ilan what if we were
 

4935
01:47:56,550 --> 01:47:58,490
did we only get one ilan what if we were
supposed to have thousands and thousands

4936
01:47:58,490 --> 01:47:58,500
supposed to have thousands and thousands
 

4937
01:47:58,500 --> 01:48:00,859
supposed to have thousands and thousands
of yuan and the weird thing is like this

4938
01:48:00,859 --> 01:48:00,869
of yuan and the weird thing is like this
 

4939
01:48:00,869 --> 01:48:02,500
of yuan and the weird thing is like this
is all that remains

4940
01:48:02,500 --> 01:48:02,510
is all that remains
 

4941
01:48:02,510 --> 01:48:06,290
is all that remains
you're looking at like obi-wan and Yoda

4942
01:48:06,290 --> 01:48:06,300
you're looking at like obi-wan and Yoda
 

4943
01:48:06,300 --> 01:48:09,200
you're looking at like obi-wan and Yoda
and it's like this is the only this is

4944
01:48:09,200 --> 01:48:09,210
and it's like this is the only this is
 

4945
01:48:09,210 --> 01:48:13,220
and it's like this is the only this is
all that's left after X order 66 has

4946
01:48:13,220 --> 01:48:13,230
all that's left after X order 66 has
 

4947
01:48:13,230 --> 01:48:15,470
all that's left after X order 66 has
been executed and that's the thing

4948
01:48:15,470 --> 01:48:15,480
been executed and that's the thing
 

4949
01:48:15,480 --> 01:48:16,970
been executed and that's the thing
that's really upsetting to me is we used

4950
01:48:16,970 --> 01:48:16,980
that's really upsetting to me is we used
 

4951
01:48:16,980 --> 01:48:19,100
that's really upsetting to me is we used
we used to have Ilan's five deep and

4952
01:48:19,100 --> 01:48:19,110
we used to have Ilan's five deep and
 

4953
01:48:19,110 --> 01:48:21,169
we used to have Ilan's five deep and
then we could talk about Elon in the

4954
01:48:21,169 --> 01:48:21,179
then we could talk about Elon in the
 

4955
01:48:21,179 --> 01:48:24,500
then we could talk about Elon in the
context of his cohort but this is like

4956
01:48:24,500 --> 01:48:24,510
context of his cohort but this is like
 

4957
01:48:24,510 --> 01:48:26,280
context of his cohort but this is like
if you were to see a

4958
01:48:26,280 --> 01:48:26,290
if you were to see a
 

4959
01:48:26,290 --> 01:48:28,470
if you were to see a
raph in the Arctic with no trees around

4960
01:48:28,470 --> 01:48:28,480
raph in the Arctic with no trees around
 

4961
01:48:28,480 --> 01:48:30,900
raph in the Arctic with no trees around
you'd think why the long neck what a

4962
01:48:30,900 --> 01:48:30,910
you'd think why the long neck what a
 

4963
01:48:30,910 --> 01:48:33,930
you'd think why the long neck what a
strange sight you know how do we get

4964
01:48:33,930 --> 01:48:33,940
strange sight you know how do we get
 

4965
01:48:33,940 --> 01:48:37,260
strange sight you know how do we get
more lawns how do we change these so I

4966
01:48:37,260 --> 01:48:37,270
more lawns how do we change these so I
 

4967
01:48:37,270 --> 01:48:41,910
more lawns how do we change these so I
think the useful so we know MIT yeah and

4968
01:48:41,910 --> 01:48:41,920
think the useful so we know MIT yeah and
 

4969
01:48:41,920 --> 01:48:44,550
think the useful so we know MIT yeah and
Harvard so can maybe returning to our

4970
01:48:44,550 --> 01:48:44,560
Harvard so can maybe returning to our
 

4971

4975
01:48:48,940 --> 01:48:52,050
the Ilan's of the world are supposed to
come from MIT in Harvard right and how

4976
01:48:52,050 --> 01:48:52,060
come from MIT in Harvard right and how
 

4977
01:48:52,060 --> 01:48:54,180
come from MIT in Harvard right and how
do you change let's think of one that

4978
01:48:54,180 --> 01:48:54,190
do you change let's think of one that
 

4979
01:48:54,190 --> 01:48:58,290
do you change let's think of one that

5567
02:01:47,389 --> 02:01:49,759
for and how long have I been patient
okay so you're talking about a mid two

5568
02:01:49,759 --> 02:01:49,769
okay so you're talking about a mid two
 

5569
02:01:49,769 --> 02:01:52,459
okay so you're talking about a mid two
patients I'm talking about like 36 years

patients I'm talking about like 36 years
 

5571

you can do like eight to ten years but

5574
02:01:56,870 --> 02:01:56,880
you can do like eight to ten years but
 

5575
02:01:56,880 --> 02:02:02,000
you can do like eight to ten years but
not more I can do 40 minutes this is 30

cancellation in in string theory it's

5584
02:02:11,060 --> 02:02:11,070
cancellation in in string theory it's
 

5585
02:02:11,070 --> 02:02:12,979
cancellation in in string theory it's
like what are you talking about about

5586
02:02:12,979 --> 02:02:12,989
like what are you talking about about
 

5587
02:02:12,989 --> 02:02:15,770
like what are you talking about about
patients I mean Lex you're not even

5588
02:02:15,770 --> 02:02:15,780
patients I mean Lex you're not even

5591
02:02:18,750 --> 02:02:20,810
acting like yourself now at what you're
trying to stay in the system and I'm not

5592
02:02:20,810 --> 02:02:20,820
trying to stay in the system and I'm not
 

5593
02:02:20,820 --> 02:02:23,589
trying to stay in the system and I'm not
sure I'm not I'm trying to see if

5594
02:02:23,589 --> 02:02:23,599
sure I'm not I'm trying to see if
 

5595
02:02:23,599 --> 02:02:27,290
sure I'm not I'm trying to see if
perhaps so so my hope is that the system

5596
02:02:27,290 --> 02:02:27,300
perhaps so so my hope is that the system
 

5597
02:02:27,300 --> 02:02:30,430
perhaps so so my hope is that the system
just has a few [\h__\h] in it which you

5598
02:02:30,430 --> 02:02:30,440
just has a few [\h__\h] in it which you
 

5599
02:02:30,440 --> 02:02:34,069
just has a few [\h__\h] in it which you
highlight and the fundamentals of the

5600
02:02:34,069 --> 02:02:34,079
highlight and the fundamentals of the
 

5601
02:02:34,079 --> 02:02:36,620
highlight and the fundamentals of the
system are broken because if the

5602
02:02:36,620 --> 02:02:36,630
system are broken because if the
 

5603
02:02:36,630 --> 02:02:38,390
system are broken because if the
fundamentals of the systems are broken

5604
02:02:38,390 --> 02:02:38,400
fundamentals of the systems are broken
 

5605
02:02:38,400 --> 02:02:40,600
fundamentals of the systems are broken
then I just don't see a way for MIT to

5606
02:02:40,600 --> 02:02:40,610
then I just don't see a way for MIT to
 

5607
02:02:40,610 --> 02:02:45,890
then I just don't see a way for MIT to
succeed like I don't see how young

5608
02:02:45,890 --> 02:02:45,900
succeed like I don't see how young
 

5609
02:02:45,900 --> 02:02:50,029
succeed like I don't see how young
people take over MIT I don't see how by

5610
02:02:50,029 --> 02:02:50,039
people take over MIT I don't see how by
 

5611
02:02:50,039 --> 02:02:53,359
people take over MIT I don't see how by
inspiring us you know the great part

5612
02:02:53,359 --> 02:02:53,369
inspiring us you know the great part
 

5613
02:02:53,369 --> 02:02:56,089

about being at MIT like when you saw the
 

5615
02:02:56,099 --> 02:03:00,470

soul inside it it was outside of the
 

6245
02:17:33,949 --> 02:17:37,780
soul inside it it was outside of the
math department and was still in the

6246
02:17:37,780 --> 02:17:37,790
math department and was still in the
 

6247
02:17:37,790 --> 02:17:39,309
math department and was still in the
same building the Science Center at

6248

minutes go by hey I let seven minutes go
 

6253
02:17:44,719 --> 02:17:46,689
minutes go by hey I let seven minutes go
by ten minutes go by there's nobody I

6254
02:17:46,689 --> 02:17:46,699
by ten minutes go by there's nobody I
 

6255
02:17:46,699 --> 02:17:48,819
by ten minutes go by there's nobody I
thought okay so this was all an

6256
02:17:48,819 --> 02:17:48,829
thought okay so this was all an

elaborate joke and then like three
 

6259
02:17:51,290 --> 02:17:54,790
elaborate joke and then like three
minutes to the hour this graduate

6260
02:17:54,790 --> 02:17:54,800
minutes to the hour this graduate
 

6261
02:17:54,800 --> 02:17:56,859
minutes to the hour this graduate
student walks in and like sees me and

6262
02:17:56,859 --> 02:17:56,869
student walks in and like sees me and
 

6263
02:17:56,869 --> 02:17:59,229
student walks in and like sees me and
does a double take and then I start to

6264
02:17:59,229 --> 02:17:59,239
does a double take and then I start to
 

6265
02:17:59,239 --> 02:18:01,929
does a double take and then I start to
see the professors in geometry and

6266
02:18:01,929 --> 02:18:01,939
see the professors in geometry and
 

6267
02:18:01,939 --> 02:18:05,189
see the professors in geometry and
topology start to file in and

6268
02:18:05,189 --> 02:18:05,199
topology start to file in and
 

6269
02:18:05,199 --> 02:18:08,620
topology start to file in and
everybody's like very disconcerted that

6270
02:18:08,620 --> 02:18:08,630
everybody's like very disconcerted that
 

6271
02:18:08,630 --> 02:18:13,089

I'm in this room and finally the person

6272
02:18:13,089 --> 02:18:13,099
I'm in this room and finally the person
 

6273
02:18:13,099 --> 02:18:15,819
I'm in this room and finally the person
who is supposed to be my advisor walks

6274
02:18:15,819 --> 02:18:15,829
who is supposed to be my advisor walks
 

6275
02:18:15,829 --> 02:18:19,089
who is supposed to be my advisor walks
in to the seminar and sees me and goes

6276
02:18:19,089 --> 02:18:19,099
in to the seminar and sees me and goes
 

6277
02:18:19,099 --> 02:18:20,399
in to the seminar and sees me and goes
white as a ghost

6278
02:18:20,399 --> 02:18:20,409
white as a ghost
 

6279
02:18:20,409 --> 02:18:24,879
white as a ghost
and I realized that the secret seminar

6280
02:18:24,879 --> 02:18:24,889
and I realized that the secret seminar
 

6281
02:18:24,889 --> 02:18:27,639
and I realized that the secret seminar
is true that the department is

6282
02:18:27,639 --> 02:18:27,649
is true that the department is
 

6283
02:18:27,649 --> 02:18:32,200
is true that the department is
conducting a secret seminar on the exact

6284
02:18:32,200 --> 02:18:32,210
conducting a secret seminar on the exact
 

6285
02:18:32,210 --> 02:18:34,569
conducting a secret seminar on the exact
topic that I'm interested in not telling

6286
02:18:34,569 --> 02:18:34,579
topic that I'm interested in not telling
 

6287
02:18:34,579 --> 02:18:36,939
topic that I'm interested in not telling
me about it and that these are the

6288
02:18:36,939 --> 02:18:36,949
me about it and that these are the
 

6289
02:18:36,949 --> 02:18:40,149
me about it and that these are the
reindeer games that the Rudolph's of the

6290
02:18:40,149 --> 02:18:40,159
reindeer games that the Rudolph's of the
 

6291
02:18:40,159 --> 02:18:43,000
reindeer games that the Rudolph's of the
department are not invited to and so

6292
02:18:43,000 --> 02:18:43,010
department are not invited to and so
 

6293
02:18:43,010 --> 02:18:45,490
department are not invited to and so
then I realize okay I did not understand

6294
02:18:45,490 --> 02:18:45,500
then I realize okay I did not understand
 

6295
02:18:45,500 --> 02:18:51,299
then I realize okay I did not understand
it there's a parallel department and

02:18:55,489 --> 02:18:59,559
that became the beginning of an
incredible Odyssey in which I came to

6300
02:18:59,559 --> 02:18:59,569
incredible Odyssey in which I came to
 

6301
02:18:59,569 --> 02:19:02,139
incredible Odyssey in which I came to
understand that the game that I had been

6302
02:19:02,139 --> 02:19:02,149
understand that the game that I had been
 

6303
02:19:02,149 --> 02:19:07,030
understand that the game that I had been
sold about publication about blind

02:19:17,980 --> 02:19:19,710

I came to understand that at the very

02:19:19,710 --> 02:19:19,720
I came to understand that at the very
 

6313
02:19:19,720 --> 02:19:23,190
I came to understand that at the very
top there's a second system that's about

submit to and so when you ask me
questions like well why wouldn't you

6328
02:19:43,530 --> 02:19:43,540
questions like well why wouldn't you

02:19:49,411 --> 02:19:49,421
answer is oh you don't know like if you
 

6335
02:19:49,421 --> 02:19:51,900
answer is oh you don't know like if you
stay in a nice hotel you don't realize

6336
02:19:51,900 --> 02:19:51,910
stay in a nice hotel you don't realize
 

6337
02:19:51,910 --> 02:19:54,600
stay in a nice hotel you don't realize
that there is an entire second structure

6338
02:19:54,600 --> 02:19:54,610
that there is an entire second structure
 

6339
02:19:54,610 --> 02:19:57,001
that there is an entire second structure
inside of that hotel where like there's

6340
02:19:57,001 --> 02:19:57,011
inside of that hotel where like there's
 

6341
02:19:57,011 --> 02:20:00,030
inside of that hotel where like there's
usually a workers cafe in a resort

6342
02:20:00,030 --> 02:20:00,040
usually a workers cafe in a resort
 

6343
02:20:00,040 --> 02:20:02,341
usually a workers cafe in a resort
complex that isn't available to the

6344
02:20:02,341 --> 02:20:02,351
complex that isn't available to the
 

6345
02:20:02,351 --> 02:20:03,871
complex that isn't available to the
people who are staying in the hotel and

6346
02:20:03,871 --> 02:20:03,881
people who are staying in the hotel and
 

6347
02:20:03,881 --> 02:20:07,261
people who are staying in the hotel and
then there are private hallways inside

6348
02:20:07,261 --> 02:20:07,271
then there are private hallways inside
 

6349
02:20:07,271 --> 02:20:10,921
then there are private hallways inside
the same hotel that are parallel

6350
02:20:10,921 --> 02:20:10,931
the same hotel that are parallel
 

6351
02:20:10,931 --> 02:20:13,261
the same hotel that are parallel
structures so that's what I found which

6352
02:20:13,261 --> 02:20:13,271
structures so that's what I found which
 

6353
02:20:13,271 --> 02:20:15,871
structures so that's what I found which
was in essence just the way you can stay

6354
02:20:15,871 --> 02:20:15,881
was in essence just the way you can stay
 

6355
02:20:15,881 --> 02:20:17,791
was in essence just the way you can stay
hotels your whole life and not realize

6356
02:20:17,791 --> 02:20:17,801
hotels your whole life and not realize
 

6357
02:20:17,801 --> 02:20:19,860
hotels your whole life and not realize
that inside of every hotel is a second

6358
02:20:19,860 --> 02:20:19,870
that inside of every hotel is a second
 

6359
02:20:19,870 --> 02:20:21,421
that inside of every hotel is a second
structure that you're not supposed to

6360
02:20:21,421 --> 02:20:21,431
structure that you're not supposed to
 

6361
02:20:21,431 --> 02:20:24,091
structure that you're not supposed to
see is the guest there is a second

see is the guest there is a second
 

6363
02:20:24,101 --> 02:20:26,161
see is the guest there is a second
structure inside of academics that

6364
02:20:26,161 --> 02:20:26,171
structure inside of academics that
 

6365
02:20:26,171 --> 02:20:28,440
structure inside of academics that
behaves totally differently with respect

6366
02:20:28,440 --> 02:20:28,450
behaves totally differently with respect
 

6367

did they do this why have a secret
 

6431
02:22:04,431 --> 02:22:07,421
did they do this why have a secret
seminar I don't understand the exact

seminar I don't understand the exact
 

6433
02:22:07,431 --> 02:22:09,430
seminar I don't understand the exact
dynamics of a secret seminar but I think

6434
02:22:09,430 --> 02:22:09,440
dynamics of a secret seminar but I think
 

6435
02:22:09,440 --> 02:22:12,310
dynamics of a secret seminar but I think
the right thing to do is to I mean to

6436
02:22:12,310 --> 02:22:12,320
the right thing to do is to I mean to
 

6437
02:22:12,320 --> 02:22:14,740
the right thing to do is to I mean to
see individuals like you there might be

6438
02:22:14,740 --> 02:22:14,750
see individuals like you there might be
 

6439
02:22:14,750 --> 02:22:17,251
see individuals like you there might be
a reason to have a secret seminar but

6440
02:22:17,251 --> 02:22:17,261
a reason to have a secret seminar but
 

6441
02:22:17,261 --> 02:22:20,051
a reason to have a secret seminar but
they should detect that an individual

6442
02:22:20,051 --> 02:22:20,061
they should detect that an individual
 

6443
02:22:20,061 --> 02:22:23,261
they should detect that an individual
like you a brilliant mind who's thinking

6444
02:22:23,261 --> 02:22:23,271
like you a brilliant mind who's thinking
 

6445
02:22:23,271 --> 02:22:24,940
like you a brilliant mind who's thinking
about certain ideas could be damaged by

6446
02:22:24,940 --> 02:22:24,950
about certain ideas could be damaged by
 

6447
02:22:24,950 --> 02:22:26,881
about certain ideas could be damaged by
this I don't think they see it that way

6448
02:22:26,881 --> 02:22:26,891
this I don't think they see it that way
 

6449
02:22:26,891 --> 02:22:30,730
this I don't think they see it that way
the idea is we're going to sneak food to

6450
02:22:30,730 --> 02:22:30,740
the idea is we're going to sneak food to
 

6451
02:22:30,740 --> 02:22:33,280
the idea is we're going to sneak food to
the children we want to survive yeah so

6452
02:22:33,280 --> 02:22:33,290
the children we want to survive yeah so
 

6453
02:22:33,290 --> 02:22:35,171
the children we want to survive yeah so
that that's highly problematic and there

6454
02:22:35,171 --> 02:22:35,181
that that's highly problematic and there
 

6455
02:22:35,181 --> 02:22:36,910
that that's highly problematic and there
should be people within that road I'm

6456
02:22:36,910 --> 02:22:36,920
should be people within that road I'm
 

6457
02:22:36,920 --> 02:22:39,461
should be people within that road I'm
trying to say this is the thing the ball

6458
02:22:39,461 --> 02:22:39,471
trying to say this is the thing the ball
 

6459
02:22:39,471 --> 02:22:41,860
trying to say this is the thing the ball
is thrown back won't be caught the

6460
02:22:41,860 --> 02:22:41,870
is thrown back won't be caught the
 

6461
02:22:41,870 --> 02:22:45,160
is thrown back won't be caught the
problem is they know that most of their

6462
02:22:45,160 --> 02:22:45,170
problem is they know that most of their
 

6463
02:22:45,170 --> 02:22:49,541
problem is they know that most of their
children won't survive and they can't

6464
02:22:49,541 --> 02:22:49,551
children won't survive and they can't

say that I see sorry to interrupt you
mean that the the fact that the whole

6468
02:22:57,490 --> 02:22:57,500
mean that the the fact that the whole
 

6469
02:22:57,500 --> 02:22:59,680
mean that the the fact that the whole
system is underfunded that they

6470
02:22:59,680 --> 02:22:59,690
system is underfunded that they
 

6471
02:22:59,690 --> 02:23:02,320
system is underfunded that they
naturally have to pick favorites they

02:23:07,210 --> 02:23:13,200
state at some level let's say you know
in the early 70s and in that world

6478
02:23:13,200 --> 02:23:13,210
in the early 70s and in that world
 

6479
02:23:13,210 --> 02:23:16,150
in the early 70s and in that world
before that time you have a professor

6480
02:23:16,150 --> 02:23:16,160
before that time you have a professor
 

6481
02:23:16,160 --> 02:23:17,890
before that time you have a professor
like Norman's steam rod and you'd have

6482
02:23:17,890 --> 02:23:17,900
like Norman's steam rod and you'd have
 

6483
02:23:17,900 --> 02:23:20,230
like Norman's steam rod and you'd have
20 children that is graduate students

6484
02:23:20,230 --> 02:23:20,240
20 children that is graduate students
 

6485
02:23:20,240 --> 02:23:21,220
20 children that is graduate students
and all of them were going to be

6486
02:23:21,220 --> 02:23:21,230
and all of them were going to be
 

6487
02:23:21,230 --> 02:23:22,810
and all of them were going to be
professors and all of them would want to

6488
02:23:22,810 --> 02:23:22,820
professors and all of them would want to
 

6489
02:23:22,820 --> 02:23:26,410
professors and all of them would want to
have 20 children right so you start like

6490
02:23:26,410 --> 02:23:26,420
have 20 children right so you start like
 

6491
02:23:26,420 --> 02:23:28,360
have 20 children right so you start like
taking higher and higher powers of 20

6492
02:23:28,360 --> 02:23:28,370
taking higher and higher powers of 20
 

6493
02:23:28,370 --> 02:23:30,730
taking higher and higher powers of 20
and you see that the system could not

6494
02:23:30,730 --> 02:23:30,740
and you see that the system could not
 

6495
02:23:30,740 --> 02:23:33,280
and you see that the system could not
it's not just about money the system

6496
02:23:33,280 --> 02:23:33,290
it's not just about money the system
 

6497
02:23:33,290 --> 02:23:35,051
it's not just about money the system
couldn't survive so the way it's

6498
02:23:35,051 --> 02:23:35,061
couldn't survive so the way it's
 

6499
02:23:35,061 --> 02:23:37,480
couldn't survive so the way it's
supposed to work now is that we should

6500
02:23:37,480 --> 02:23:37,490
supposed to work now is that we should
 

6501
02:23:37,490 --> 02:23:40,480
supposed to work now is that we should
shut down the vast majority of PhD

6502
02:23:40,480 --> 02:23:40,490
shut down the vast majority of PhD
 

6503
02:23:40,490 --> 02:23:43,180
shut down the vast majority of PhD
programs and we should let the small

6504
02:23:43,180 --> 02:23:43,190
programs and we should let the small
 

6505
02:23:43,190 --> 02:23:47,470
programs and we should let the small
number of truly top places pop

6506
02:23:47,470 --> 02:23:47,480

 

6507
02:23:47,480 --> 02:23:50,470

mostly teaching and research departments

6508
02:23:50,470 --> 02:23:50,480
mostly teaching and research departments
 

6509
02:23:50,480 --> 02:23:53,410
mostly teaching and research departments
that aren't PhD producing we don't want

6510
02:23:53,410 --> 02:23:53,420
that aren't PhD producing we don't want
 

6511
02:23:53,420 --> 02:23:55,870
that aren't PhD producing we don't want
to do that because we use PhD students

6512
02:23:55,870 --> 02:23:55,880
to do that because we use PhD students
 

6513
02:23:55,880 --> 02:23:57,730
to do that because we use PhD students
as a labor force so the whole thing has

6514
02:23:57,730 --> 02:23:57,740
as a labor force so the whole thing has
 

6515
02:23:57,740 --> 02:24:02,080
as a labor force so the whole thing has
to do with growth resources dishonesty

6516
02:24:02,080 --> 02:24:02,090
to do with growth resources dishonesty
 

6517
02:24:02,090 --> 02:24:05,261
to do with growth resources dishonesty
and in that world you see all of these

6518
02:24:05,261 --> 02:24:05,271
and in that world you see all of these
 

6519
02:24:05,271 --> 02:24:08,320
and in that world you see all of these
adaptations to a ruthless world where

6520
02:24:08,320 --> 02:24:08,330
adaptations to a ruthless world where
 

6521
02:24:08,330 --> 02:24:10,180
adaptations to a ruthless world where
the key question is where are we going

6522
02:24:10,180 --> 02:24:10,190
the key question is where are we going
 

6523
02:24:10,190 --> 02:24:12,011
the key question is where are we going
to bury this huge number of bodies of

6524
02:24:12,011 --> 02:24:12,021
to bury this huge number of bodies of
 

6525
02:24:12,021 --> 02:24:15,700
to bury this huge number of bodies of
people who don't work out so my problem

6526
02:24:15,700 --> 02:24:15,710
people who don't work out so my problem
 

6527
02:24:15,710 --> 02:24:20,470
people who don't work out so my problem
was I wasn't interested in dying so you

6528
02:24:20,470 --> 02:24:20,480
was I wasn't interested in dying so you
 

6529
02:24:20,480 --> 02:24:22,030
was I wasn't interested in dying so you
clearly highlight that there's aspects

6530
02:24:22,030 --> 02:24:22,040
clearly highlight that there's aspects
 

6531
02:24:22,040 --> 02:24:23,501
clearly highlight that there's aspects
of the system that are broken but as an

6532
02:24:23,501 --> 02:24:23,511
of the system that are broken but as an
 

6533
02:24:23,511 --> 02:24:29,291
of the system that are broken but as an
individual is your role to exit the

6534
02:24:29,291 --> 02:24:29,301
individual is your role to exit the
 

6535
02:24:29,301 --> 02:24:31,870
individual is your role to exit the
system or just acknowledge it as a game

6536
02:24:31,870 --> 02:24:31,880
system or just acknowledge it as a game
 

6537
02:24:31,880 --> 02:24:34,301
system or just acknowledge it as a game
and win it my role is to survive and

6538
02:24:34,301 --> 02:24:34,311
and win it my role is to survive and
 

6539
02:24:34,311 --> 02:24:38,251
and win it my role is to survive and
thrive in the public eye in other words

6540
02:24:38,251 --> 02:24:38,261
thrive in the public eye in other words
 

6541
02:24:38,261 --> 02:24:41,730
thrive in the public eye in other words
when you have an escapee of the system

6542
02:24:41,730 --> 02:24:41,740
when you have an escapee of the system
 

6543
02:24:41,740 --> 02:24:45,910
when you have an escapee of the system
like yourself such as and that person

6544
02:24:45,910 --> 02:24:45,920
like yourself such as and that person
 

6545
02:24:45,920 --> 02:24:47,711
like yourself such as and that person
says you know I wasn't exactly finished

where why in this story you know was it

6584
02:25:40,690 --> 02:25:40,700
where why in this story you know was it

02:25:40,700 --> 02:25:43,150
where why in this story you know was it
a of telomeres was it an older professor

6586

a of telomeres was it an older professor
 

6587
02:25:43,160 --> 02:25:45,730
a of telomeres was it an older professor
and a younger graduate student it's this

6588
02:25:45,730 --> 02:25:45,740
and a younger graduate student it's this
 

6589
02:25:45,740 --> 02:25:47,680
and a younger graduate student it's this
issue of what would be called

issue of what would be called
 

6591
02:25:47,690 --> 02:25:50,890
issue of what would be called
interference competition so for example

6592

okay well what are the universities do

6602
02:26:01,400 --> 02:26:01,410
okay well what are the universities do

play well my point is ok what's the cost

6614
02:26:19,400 --> 02:26:19,410
play well my point is ok what's the cost
 

6615

play well my point is ok what's the cost
of this how many people died as a result

a system yeah can't you at this because

6646
02:26:57,440 --> 02:26:57,450
a system yeah can't you at this because
 

6647
02:26:57,450 --> 02:27:00,590
a system yeah can't you at this because
you also have in your mind a powerful

the place that it goes south is there's
 

6767
02:29:35,550 --> 02:29:37,580
the place that it goes south is there's
like a set of questions that get you

6768
02:29:37,580 --> 02:29:37,590
like a set of questions that get you
 

6769
02:29:37,590 --> 02:29:39,801
like a set of questions that get you
into this more adversarial stuff and

6770
02:29:39,801 --> 02:29:39,811
into this more adversarial stuff and
 

6771
02:29:39,811 --> 02:29:41,690
into this more adversarial stuff and
you've in fact asks some of those more

6772
02:29:41,690 --> 02:29:41,700
you've in fact asks some of those more
 

6773
02:29:41,700 --> 02:29:43,880
you've in fact asks some of those more
adversarial questions this setting and

adversarial questions this setting and
 

6775
02:29:43,890 --> 02:29:46,160
adversarial questions this setting and
they're not things that are necessarily

6776
02:29:46,160 --> 02:29:46,170
they're not things that are necessarily
 

6777
02:29:46,170 --> 02:29:47,750
they're not things that are necessarily
aggressive but there are things that are

6778
02:29:47,750 --> 02:29:47,760
aggressive but there are things that are
 

6779
02:29:47,760 --> 02:29:50,900
aggressive but there are things that are
making assumptions right right well so

6780
02:29:50,900 --> 02:29:50,910
making assumptions right right well so
 

6781
02:29:50,910 --> 02:29:52,340
making assumptions right right well so
when you make it I have a questions like

6782
02:29:52,340 --> 02:29:52,350
when you make it I have a questions like
 

6783
02:29:52,350 --> 02:29:55,011
when you make it I have a questions like
you know Lex are you avoiding your

6784
02:29:55,011 --> 02:29:55,021
you know Lex are you avoiding your
 

6785
02:29:55,021 --> 02:29:58,100
you know Lex are you avoiding your
critics you know it's just like okay

6786
02:29:58,100 --> 02:29:58,110
critics you know it's just like okay
 

6787
02:29:58,110 --> 02:29:59,600
critics you know it's just like okay
well why did you frame that that way or

6788
02:29:59,600 --> 02:29:59,610
well why did you frame that that way or
 

6789
02:29:59,610 --> 02:30:02,660
well why did you frame that that way or
the next question would be it's like do

6790
02:30:02,660 --> 02:30:02,670
the next question would be it's like do
 

6791
02:30:02,670 --> 02:30:03,830
the next question would be it's like do
you think that you should have a special

6792
02:30:03,830 --> 02:30:03,840
you think that you should have a special
 

6793
02:30:03,840 --> 02:30:05,301
you think that you should have a special
exemption and that you should have the

6794
02:30:05,301 --> 02:30:05,311
exemption and that you should have the
 

6795
02:30:05,311 --> 02:30:06,650
exemption and that you should have the
right to break rules and everyone else

6796
02:30:06,650 --> 02:30:06,660
right to break rules and everyone else
 

6797
02:30:06,660 --> 02:30:08,390
right to break rules and everyone else
should have to follow them like that

6798
02:30:08,390 --> 02:30:08,400
should have to follow them like that
 

6799
02:30:08,400 --> 02:30:10,520
should have to follow them like that
question I find enervating yeah it

6800
02:30:10,520 --> 02:30:10,530
question I find enervating yeah it
 

6801
02:30:10,530 --> 02:30:11,630
question I find enervating yeah it
doesn't really come out of anything

6802
02:30:11,630 --> 02:30:11,640
doesn't really come out of anything
 

6803
02:30:11,640 --> 02:30:13,520
doesn't really come out of anything
meaningful it's just like we feel we're

6804
02:30:13,520 --> 02:30:13,530
meaningful it's just like we feel we're
 

6805
02:30:13,530 --> 02:30:15,261
meaningful it's just like we feel we're
supposed to ask that of the other person

6806
02:30:15,261 --> 02:30:15,271
supposed to ask that of the other person
 

6807
02:30:15,271 --> 02:30:17,240
supposed to ask that of the other person
to show that we're not captured by their

6808
02:30:17,240 --> 02:30:17,250
to show that we're not captured by their
 

6809
02:30:17,250 --> 02:30:19,280
to show that we're not captured by their
madness that's not the real question you

6810
02:30:19,280 --> 02:30:19,290
madness that's not the real question you
 

6811

6815
02:30:23,460 --> 02:30:25,620
excited about this you want to ask do
you think this thing is right

6816
02:30:25,620 --> 02:30:25,630
you think this thing is right
 

6817

it's going to be immediately seen to be

6820
02:30:29,880 --> 02:30:29,890
it's going to be immediately seen to be
 

6821
02:30:29,890 --> 02:30:32,760
it's going to be immediately seen to be
right I don't I think it's gonna it's

6822
02:30:32,760 --> 02:30:32,770
right I don't I think it's gonna it's
 

6823
02:30:32,770 --> 02:30:34,110
right I don't I think it's gonna it's
gonna have an interesting fight and it's

6824
02:30:34,110 --> 02:30:34,120
gonna have an interesting fight and it's
 

6825
02:30:34,120 --> 02:30:35,929
gonna have an interesting fight and it's
gonna have an interesting evolution and

6826
02:30:35,929 --> 02:30:35,939
gonna have an interesting evolution and
 

6827
02:30:35,939 --> 02:30:38,270
gonna have an interesting evolution and
well what do you hope to do with it in

6828
02:30:38,270 --> 02:30:38,280
well what do you hope to do with it in
 

6829
02:30:38,280 --> 02:30:40,560
well what do you hope to do with it in
non-physical terms my gosh I hope it

6830
02:30:40,560 --> 02:30:40,570
non-physical terms my gosh I hope it
 

6831
02:30:40,570 --> 02:30:45,600
non-physical terms my gosh I hope it
revolutionizes our relationship of well

6832
02:30:45,600 --> 02:30:45,610
revolutionizes our relationship of well
 

6833
02:30:45,610 --> 02:30:47,310
revolutionizes our relationship of well
with people outside of the institutional

6834
02:30:47,310 --> 02:30:47,320
with people outside of the institutional
 

6835
02:30:47,320 --> 02:30:49,469
with people outside of the institutional
framework and it reinforces into the

6836
02:30:49,469 --> 02:30:49,479
framework and it reinforces into the
 

6837
02:30:49,479 --> 02:30:50,969
framework and it reinforces into the
institutional framework where we can do

6838
02:30:50,969 --> 02:30:50,979
institutional framework where we can do
 

6839
02:30:50,979 --> 02:30:53,429
institutional framework where we can do
the most good to bring the institution's

6840
02:30:53,429 --> 02:30:53,439
the most good to bring the institution's
 

6841
02:30:53,439 --> 02:30:56,610
the most good to bring the institution's
back to health you know it's like these

6842
02:30:56,610 --> 02:30:56,620
back to health you know it's like these
 

6843
02:30:56,620 --> 02:30:58,650
back to health you know it's like these
are positive uplifting questions yeah if

6844
02:30:58,650 --> 02:30:58,660
are positive uplifting questions yeah if
 

6845
02:30:58,660 --> 02:31:00,810
are positive uplifting questions yeah if
you had Frank we'll check you wouldn't

6846
02:31:00,810 --> 02:31:00,820
you had Frank we'll check you wouldn't
 

6847
02:31:00,820 --> 02:31:03,840
you had Frank we'll check you wouldn't
say Frank let's be honest you have done

6848
02:31:03,840 --> 02:31:03,850
say Frank let's be honest you have done
 

6849
02:31:03,850 --> 02:31:05,400
say Frank let's be honest you have done
very little with your life after the

6850
02:31:05,400 --> 02:31:05,410
very little with your life after the
 

6851
02:31:05,410 --> 02:31:08,820
very little with your life after the
original huge show that you used to

6852
02:31:08,820 --> 02:31:08,830
original huge show that you used to
 

6853
02:31:08,830 --> 02:31:10,620
original huge show that you used to
break onto the physics scene like we

6854
02:31:10,620 --> 02:31:10,630
break onto the physics scene like we
 

6855
02:31:10,630 --> 02:31:12,900
break onto the physics scene like we
weirdly ask people different questions

6856
02:31:12,900 --> 02:31:12,910
weirdly ask people different questions
 

6857
02:31:12,910 --> 02:31:15,300
weirdly ask people different questions
based on how they sit down yeah that's

6858
02:31:15,300 --> 02:31:15,310
based on how they sit down yeah that's
 

6859
02:31:15,310 --> 02:31:17,790
based on how they sit down yeah that's
very strange right but you have to

6860
02:31:17,790 --> 02:31:17,800
very strange right but you have to
 

6861
02:31:17,800 --> 02:31:20,760
very strange right but you have to
understand that so here's the thing I

6862
02:31:20,760 --> 02:31:20,770
understand that so here's the thing I
 

6863
02:31:20,770 --> 02:31:24,450
understand that so here's the thing I
get these days a large number of emails

6864
02:31:24,450 --> 02:31:24,460
get these days a large number of emails
 

6865
02:31:24,460 --> 02:31:27,179
get these days a large number of emails
from people with the equivalent of a

6866
02:31:27,179 --> 02:31:27,189
from people with the equivalent of a
 

6867
02:31:27,189 --> 02:31:30,690
from people with the equivalent of a
theory of everything for a GI yeah and I

6868
02:31:30,690 --> 02:31:30,700
theory of everything for a GI yeah and I
 

6869
02:31:30,700 --> 02:31:37,940
theory of everything for a GI yeah and I
use my own radar BFBS radar to detect on

6870
02:31:37,940 --> 02:31:37,950
use my own radar BFBS radar to detect on
 

6871
02:31:37,950 --> 02:31:40,469
use my own radar BFBS radar to detect on
unfairly perhaps whether they're full

6872
02:31:40,469 --> 02:31:40,479
unfairly perhaps whether they're full
 

6873
02:31:40,479 --> 02:31:43,560
unfairly perhaps whether they're full
[\h__\h] or not right because I love what

6874
02:31:43,560 --> 02:31:43,570
[\h__\h] or not right because I love what
 

6875
02:31:43,570 --> 02:31:44,670
[\h__\h] or not right because I love what
you're where you're going with this by

6876
02:31:44,670 --> 02:31:44,680
you're where you're going with this by
 

6877
02:31:44,680 --> 02:31:50,219
you're where you're going with this by
the way and Mike my concern that I often

6878
02:31:50,219 --> 02:31:50,229
the way and Mike my concern that I often
 

6879
02:31:50,229 --> 02:31:52,889
the way and Mike my concern that I often
think about is there's elements of

6880
02:31:52,889 --> 02:31:52,899
think about is there's elements of
 

6881
02:31:52,899 --> 02:31:54,600
think about is there's elements of
brilliance and what people write to me

6882
02:31:54,600 --> 02:31:54,610
brilliance and what people write to me
 

6883
02:31:54,610 --> 02:31:58,620
brilliance and what people write to me
and I and I'm trying to right now as you

6884
02:31:58,620 --> 02:31:58,630
and I and I'm trying to right now as you
 

6885
02:31:58,630 --> 02:32:01,139
and I and I'm trying to right now as you
made it clear at the kind of judgments

6886
02:32:01,139 --> 02:32:01,149
made it clear at the kind of judgments
 

6887
02:32:01,149 --> 02:32:03,570
made it clear at the kind of judgments
and assumptions we make how am I

6888
02:32:03,570 --> 02:32:03,580
and assumptions we make how am I
 

6889
02:32:03,580 --> 02:32:06,330
and assumptions we make how am I
supposed to deal with you who are not an

6890
02:32:06,330 --> 02:32:06,340
supposed to deal with you who are not an
 

6891
02:32:06,340 --> 02:32:09,500
supposed to deal with you who are not an
outsider of the system and think about

6892
02:32:09,500 --> 02:32:09,510
outsider of the system and think about
 

6893
02:32:09,510 --> 02:32:12,420
outsider of the system and think about
what you're doing because my radar

6894
02:32:12,420 --> 02:32:12,430
what you're doing because my radar
 

6895
02:32:12,430 --> 02:32:15,570
what you're doing because my radar
saying you're not full of [\h__\h] you know

6896
02:32:15,570 --> 02:32:15,580
saying you're not full of [\h__\h] you know
 

6897
02:32:15,580 --> 02:32:17,190
saying you're not full of [\h__\h] you know
what I'm also not completely outside of

6898
02:32:17,190 --> 02:32:17,200
what I'm also not completely outside of
 

6899
02:32:17,200 --> 02:32:19,320
what I'm also not completely outside of
the system that's right you've danced

6900
02:32:19,320 --> 02:32:19,330
the system that's right you've danced
 

6901
02:32:19,330 --> 02:32:22,290
the system that's right you've danced
beautifully you've actually get got all

6902
02:32:22,290 --> 02:32:22,300
beautifully you've actually get got all
 

6903
02:32:22,300 --> 02:32:25,080
beautifully you've actually get got all
the credibility that you're supposed to

6904
02:32:25,080 --> 02:32:25,090
the credibility that you're supposed to
 

6905
02:32:25,090 --> 02:32:26,700
the credibility that you're supposed to
get all the nice little stamps of

6906
02:32:26,700 --> 02:32:26,710
get all the nice little stamps of
 

6907
02:32:26,710 --> 02:32:30,000
get all the nice little stamps of
approval not all but a large enough

6908
02:32:30,000 --> 02:32:30,010
approval not all but a large enough
 

6909
02:32:30,010 --> 02:32:34,260
approval not all but a large enough
amount you use I mean it's hard to put

6910
02:32:34,260 --> 02:32:34,270
amount you use I mean it's hard to put
 

6911
02:32:34,270 --> 02:32:38,380
amount you use I mean it's hard to put
into words exactly why you

6912
02:32:38,380 --> 02:32:38,390
into words exactly why you
 

6913
02:32:38,390 --> 02:32:41,710
into words exactly why you
sound whether your theory turns out to

6914
02:32:41,710 --> 02:32:41,720
sound whether your theory turns out to
 

6915
02:32:41,720 --> 02:32:45,670
sound whether your theory turns out to
be good or not you sound like a special

6916
02:32:45,670 --> 02:32:45,680
be good or not you sound like a special
 

6917
02:32:45,680 --> 02:32:48,070
be good or not you sound like a special
human being I appreciate that and thank

6918
02:32:48,070 --> 02:32:48,080
human being I appreciate that and thank
 

6919
02:32:48,080 --> 02:32:51,370
human being I appreciate that and thank
you in a good way all right so but what

6920
02:32:51,370 --> 02:32:51,380
you in a good way all right so but what
 

6921
02:32:51,380 --> 02:32:52,719
you in a good way all right so but what
am I supposed to do with that flood of

6922
02:32:52,719 --> 02:32:52,729
am I supposed to do with that flood of
 

6923
02:32:52,729 --> 02:32:55,420
am I supposed to do with that flood of
emails for me AJ why do I sound

6924
02:32:55,420 --> 02:32:55,430
emails for me AJ why do I sound
 

6925
02:32:55,430 --> 02:32:58,660
emails for me AJ why do I sound
different I don't know and I would like

6926
02:32:58,660 --> 02:32:58,670
different I don't know and I would like
 

6927
02:32:58,670 --> 02:33:02,530
different I don't know and I would like
to systemize that I don't know look you

6928
02:33:02,530 --> 02:33:02,540
to systemize that I don't know look you
 

6929
02:33:02,540 --> 02:33:06,429
to systemize that I don't know look you
know when you're talking to people you

6930
02:33:06,429 --> 02:33:06,439
know when you're talking to people you
 

6931
02:33:06,439 --> 02:33:09,099
know when you're talking to people you
very quickly consume eyes like am i

6932
02:33:09,099 --> 02:33:09,109
very quickly consume eyes like am i
 

6933
02:33:09,109 --> 02:33:11,170
very quickly consume eyes like am i
claiming to be a physicist no I say it

6934
02:33:11,170 --> 02:33:11,180
claiming to be a physicist no I say it
 

6935
02:33:11,180 --> 02:33:13,889
claiming to be a physicist no I say it
every turn I'm not a physicist right

6936
02:33:13,889 --> 02:33:13,899
every turn I'm not a physicist right
 

6937
02:33:13,899 --> 02:33:16,149
every turn I'm not a physicist right
when I say to you when you say something

6938
02:33:16,149 --> 02:33:16,159
when I say to you when you say something
 

6939
02:33:16,159 --> 02:33:17,439
when I say to you when you say something
about bundles you say well can you

6940
02:33:17,439 --> 02:33:17,449
about bundles you say well can you
 

6941
02:33:17,449 --> 02:33:19,179
about bundles you say well can you
explain it differently I think you know

6942
02:33:19,179 --> 02:33:19,189
explain it differently I think you know
 

6943
02:33:19,189 --> 02:33:22,840
explain it differently I think you know
I'm pushing around on this this area

6944
02:33:22,840 --> 02:33:22,850
I'm pushing around on this this area
 

6945
02:33:22,850 --> 02:33:26,410
I'm pushing around on this this area
that lever over there I'm trying to find

6946
02:33:26,410 --> 02:33:26,420
that lever over there I'm trying to find
 

6947
02:33:26,420 --> 02:33:28,479
that lever over there I'm trying to find
something that we can play with and

6948
02:33:28,479 --> 02:33:28,489
something that we can play with and
 

6949
02:33:28,489 --> 02:33:31,450
something that we can play with and
engage and you know another thing is is

6950
02:33:31,450 --> 02:33:31,460
engage and you know another thing is is
 

6951
02:33:31,460 --> 02:33:34,780
engage and you know another thing is is
that I'll say something at scale so if I

6952
02:33:34,780 --> 02:33:34,790
that I'll say something at scale so if I
 

6953
02:33:34,790 --> 02:33:36,610
that I'll say something at scale so if I
was saying completely wrong things about

6954
02:33:36,610 --> 02:33:36,620
was saying completely wrong things about
 

6955
02:33:36,620 --> 02:33:38,830
was saying completely wrong things about
bundles on the Joe Rogan program you

6956
02:33:38,830 --> 02:33:38,840
bundles on the Joe Rogan program you
 

6957
02:33:38,840 --> 02:33:40,120
bundles on the Joe Rogan program you
don't think that we wouldn't hear a

6958
02:33:40,120 --> 02:33:40,130
don't think that we wouldn't hear a
 

6959
02:33:40,130 --> 02:33:43,420
don't think that we wouldn't hear a
crushing chorus yes and it's actually

6960
02:33:43,420 --> 02:33:43,430
crushing chorus yes and it's actually
 

6961
02:33:43,430 --> 02:33:45,070
crushing chorus yes and it's actually
you know same thing with geometric unity

6962
02:33:45,070 --> 02:33:45,080
you know same thing with geometric unity
 

6963
02:33:45,080 --> 02:33:49,240
you know same thing with geometric unity
so I put up this this video from this

6964
02:33:49,240 --> 02:33:49,250
so I put up this this video from this
 

6965
02:33:49,250 --> 02:33:51,160
so I put up this this video from this
oxford lecture I understand this not a

6966
02:33:51,160 --> 02:33:51,170
oxford lecture I understand this not a
 

6967
02:33:51,170 --> 02:33:55,030
oxford lecture I understand this not a
standard lecture but you haven't heard

6968
02:33:55,030 --> 02:33:55,040
standard lecture but you haven't heard
 

6969
02:33:55,040 --> 02:33:57,700
standard lecture but you haven't heard
you know the most brilliant people in

6970
02:33:57,700 --> 02:33:57,710
you know the most brilliant people in
 

6971
02:33:57,710 --> 02:33:59,229
you know the most brilliant people in
the field said well this is obviously

6972
02:33:59,229 --> 02:33:59,239
the field said well this is obviously
 

6973
02:33:59,239 --> 02:34:01,719
the field said well this is obviously
nonsense they don't know what to make of

6974
02:34:01,719 --> 02:34:01,729
nonsense they don't know what to make of
 

6975
02:34:01,729 --> 02:34:05,260
nonsense they don't know what to make of
it yeah I'm gonna hide behind well he

6976
02:34:05,260 --> 02:34:05,270
it yeah I'm gonna hide behind well he
 

6977
02:34:05,270 --> 02:34:06,910
it yeah I'm gonna hide behind well he
hasn't said enough to tale where's the

6978
02:34:06,910 --> 02:34:06,920
hasn't said enough to tale where's the
 

6979
02:34:06,920 --> 02:34:09,340
hasn't said enough to tale where's the
paper and where's the paper I've seen

6980
02:34:09,340 --> 02:34:09,350
paper and where's the paper I've seen
 

6981
02:34:09,350 --> 02:34:11,139
paper and where's the paper I've seen
the criticism yeah I've gotten the same

6982
02:34:11,139 --> 02:34:11,149
the criticism yeah I've gotten the same
 

6983
02:34:11,149 --> 02:34:13,090
the criticism yeah I've gotten the same
kind of Critias I've published a few

6984
02:34:13,090 --> 02:34:13,100
kind of Critias I've published a few
 

6985
02:34:13,100 --> 02:34:16,300
kind of Critias I've published a few
things and like especially stuff related

6986
02:34:16,300 --> 02:34:16,310
things and like especially stuff related
 

6987
02:34:16,310 --> 02:34:19,570
things and like especially stuff related
to Tesla that we did studies and Tesla

6988
02:34:19,570 --> 02:34:19,580
to Tesla that we did studies and Tesla
 

6989
02:34:19,580 --> 02:34:21,370
to Tesla that we did studies and Tesla
vehicles and the kind of criticism I've

6990
02:34:21,370 --> 02:34:21,380
vehicles and the kind of criticism I've
 

6991
02:34:21,380 --> 02:34:23,590
vehicles and the kind of criticism I've
gotten was showed that they're

6992
02:34:23,590 --> 02:34:23,600
gotten was showed that they're
 

6993
02:34:23,600 --> 02:34:26,110
gotten was showed that they're
completely oh right like the guy who had

6994
02:34:26,110 --> 02:34:26,120
completely oh right like the guy who had
 

6995
02:34:26,120 --> 02:34:28,300
completely oh right like the guy who had
Elon Musk on his program twice is gonna

6996
02:34:28,300 --> 02:34:28,310
Elon Musk on his program twice is gonna
 

6997
02:34:28,310 --> 02:34:29,740
Elon Musk on his program twice is gonna
give us an accurate assessment yeah

6998
02:34:29,740 --> 02:34:29,750
give us an accurate assessment yeah
 

6999
02:34:29,750 --> 02:34:32,349
give us an accurate assessment yeah
exactly exactly it's just very low-level

7000
02:34:32,349 --> 02:34:32,359
exactly exactly it's just very low-level
 

7001
02:34:32,359 --> 02:34:34,870
exactly exactly it's just very low-level
like without actually ever addressing

7002
02:34:34,870 --> 02:34:34,880
like without actually ever addressing
 

7003
02:34:34,880 --> 02:34:41,019
like without actually ever addressing
you know the content you know Lex I

7004
02:34:41,019 --> 02:34:41,029
you know the content you know Lex I
 

7005
02:34:41,029 --> 02:34:43,210
you know the content you know Lex I
think that in part you're trying to

7006
02:34:43,210 --> 02:34:43,220
think that in part you're trying to
 

7007
02:34:43,220 --> 02:34:45,040
think that in part you're trying to
solve a puzzle that isn't really your

7008
02:34:45,040 --> 02:34:45,050
solve a puzzle that isn't really your
 

7009
02:34:45,050 --> 02:34:47,050
solve a puzzle that isn't really your

you don't know whether the theory is

7012
02:34:49,059 --> 02:34:49,069
you don't know whether the theory is
 

7013
02:34:49,069 --> 02:34:50,300
you don't know whether the theory is
going to work or not

7014
02:34:50,300 --> 02:34:50,310
going to work or not
 

7015
02:34:50,310 --> 02:34:52,429
going to work or not
and you know that it's not coming out of

7016
02:34:52,429 --> 02:34:52,439
and you know that it's not coming out of
 

7017
02:34:52,439 --> 02:34:53,979
and you know that it's not coming out of
somebody who's coming out of left field

7018
02:34:53,979 --> 02:34:53,989
somebody who's coming out of left field
 

7019
02:34:53,989 --> 02:34:56,420
somebody who's coming out of left field
like the story makes sense there's

7020
02:34:56,420 --> 02:34:56,430
like the story makes sense there's
 

7021
02:34:56,430 --> 02:34:59,030
like the story makes sense there's
enough that's new and creative and

7022
02:34:59,030 --> 02:34:59,040
enough that's new and creative and
 

7023
02:34:59,040 --> 02:35:01,580
enough that's new and creative and
different in other aspects where you can

7024
02:35:01,580 --> 02:35:01,590
different in other aspects where you can
 

7025
02:35:01,590 --> 02:35:05,870
different in other aspects where you can
check me that your real concern is are

7026
02:35:05,870 --> 02:35:05,880
check me that your real concern is are
 

7027
02:35:05,880 --> 02:35:07,370
check me that your real concern is are
you really telling me that when you

7028
02:35:07,370 --> 02:35:07,380
you really telling me that when you
 

7029
02:35:07,380 --> 02:35:09,050
you really telling me that when you
start breaking the rules you see the

7030
02:35:09,050 --> 02:35:09,060
start breaking the rules you see the
 

7031
02:35:09,060 --> 02:35:11,420
start breaking the rules you see the
system for what it is and it's become

7032
02:35:11,420 --> 02:35:11,430
system for what it is and it's become
 

7033
02:35:11,430 --> 02:35:13,160
system for what it is and it's become
really vicious and aggressive and the

7034
02:35:13,160 --> 02:35:13,170
really vicious and aggressive and the
 

7035
02:35:13,170 --> 02:35:15,920
really vicious and aggressive and the
answer is yes and I had to break the

7036
02:35:15,920 --> 02:35:15,930
answer is yes and I had to break the
 

7037
02:35:15,930 --> 02:35:18,019
answer is yes and I had to break the
rules in part because of learning issues

7038
02:35:18,019 --> 02:35:18,029
rules in part because of learning issues
 

7039
02:35:18,029 --> 02:35:20,540
rules in part because of learning issues
because I came into this field you know

7040
02:35:20,540 --> 02:35:20,550
because I came into this field you know
 

7041
02:35:20,550 --> 02:35:21,950
because I came into this field you know
with a totally different set of

7042
02:35:21,950 --> 02:35:21,960
with a totally different set of
 

7043
02:35:21,960 --> 02:35:24,679
with a totally different set of
attributes my profile just doesn't look

7044
02:35:24,679 --> 02:35:24,689
attributes my profile just doesn't look
 

7045
02:35:24,689 --> 02:35:27,380
attributes my profile just doesn't look
like anybody else's remotely but as a

7046
02:35:27,380 --> 02:35:27,390
like anybody else's remotely but as a
 

7047
02:35:27,390 --> 02:35:29,240
like anybody else's remotely but as a
result what that did is it showed me

7048
02:35:29,240 --> 02:35:29,250
result what that did is it showed me
 

7049
02:35:29,250 --> 02:35:31,939
result what that did is it showed me
what is the system true to its own

7050
02:35:31,939 --> 02:35:31,949
what is the system true to its own
 

7051
02:35:31,949 --> 02:35:34,099
what is the system true to its own
ideals or does it just follow these

7052
02:35:34,099 --> 02:35:34,109
ideals or does it just follow these
 

7053
02:35:34,109 --> 02:35:36,080
ideals or does it just follow these
weird procedures and then when it when

7054
02:35:36,080 --> 02:35:36,090
weird procedures and then when it when
 

7055
02:35:36,090 --> 02:35:38,750
weird procedures and then when it when
you take it off the rails it behaves

7056
02:35:38,750 --> 02:35:38,760
you take it off the rails it behaves
 

7057
02:35:38,760 --> 02:35:40,760
you take it off the rails it behaves
terribly and that's really what my story

7058
02:35:40,760 --> 02:35:40,770
terribly and that's really what my story
 

7059
02:35:40,770 --> 02:35:44,389
terribly and that's really what my story
I think does is it just says well he

7060
02:35:44,389 --> 02:35:44,399
I think does is it just says well he
 

7061
02:35:44,399 --> 02:35:47,120
I think does is it just says well he
completely takes the system into new

7062
02:35:47,120 --> 02:35:47,130
completely takes the system into new
 

7063
02:35:47,130 --> 02:35:49,010
completely takes the system into new
territory where it's not expecting to

7064
02:35:49,010 --> 02:35:49,020
territory where it's not expecting to
 

7065
02:35:49,020 --> 02:35:50,149
territory where it's not expecting to
have to deal with somebody with these

7066
02:35:50,149 --> 02:35:50,159
have to deal with somebody with these
 

7067
02:35:50,159 --> 02:35:53,540
have to deal with somebody with these
confusing sets of attributes and I think

7068
02:35:53,540 --> 02:35:53,550
confusing sets of attributes and I think
 

7069
02:35:53,550 --> 02:35:55,160
confusing sets of attributes and I think
what he's telling us is he believes it

7070
02:35:55,160 --> 02:35:55,170
what he's telling us is he believes it
 

7071
02:35:55,170 --> 02:35:58,040
what he's telling us is he believes it
behaves terribly now if you take

7072
02:35:58,040 --> 02:35:58,050
behaves terribly now if you take
 

7073
02:35:58,050 --> 02:36:01,099
behaves terribly now if you take
somebody with perfect standardized tests

7074
02:36:01,099 --> 02:36:01,109
somebody with perfect standardized tests
 

7075
02:36:01,109 --> 02:36:03,380
somebody with perfect standardized tests
and you know a winner of math

7076
02:36:03,380 --> 02:36:03,390
and you know a winner of math
 

7077
02:36:03,390 --> 02:36:05,510
and you know a winner of math
competitions and you put them in a ph.d

7078
02:36:05,510 --> 02:36:05,520
competitions and you put them in a ph.d
 

7079
02:36:05,520 --> 02:36:08,179
competitions and you put them in a ph.d
program they're probably going to be

7080
02:36:08,179 --> 02:36:08,189
program they're probably going to be
 

7081
02:36:08,189 --> 02:36:14,179
program they're probably going to be
okay I'm not saying that the system you

7082
02:36:14,179 --> 02:36:14,189
okay I'm not saying that the system you
 

7083
02:36:14,189 --> 02:36:16,280
okay I'm not saying that the system you
know breaks down for any everybody under

7084
02:36:16,280 --> 02:36:16,290
know breaks down for any everybody under
 

7085
02:36:16,290 --> 02:36:18,859
know breaks down for any everybody under
all circumstances I'm saying when you

7086
02:36:18,859 --> 02:36:18,869
all circumstances I'm saying when you
 

7087
02:36:18,869 --> 02:36:20,330
all circumstances I'm saying when you
present the system with a novel

what have you learned about conversation
about human to human conversation well I

7146
02:37:44,810 --> 02:37:44,820
about human to human conversation well I
 

7147
02:37:44,820 --> 02:37:46,190
about human to human conversation well I
have a problem and I haven't solved on

7148
02:37:46,190 --> 02:37:46,200
have a problem and I haven't solved on
 

7149
02:37:46,200 --> 02:37:50,000
have a problem and I haven't solved on
the portal which is that in general when

7150
02:37:50,000 --> 02:37:50,010
the portal which is that in general when
 

7151
02:37:50,010 --> 02:37:52,460
the portal which is that in general when
I ask people questions they usually find

7152
02:37:52,460 --> 02:37:52,470
I ask people questions they usually find
 

7153
02:37:52,470 --> 02:37:56,480
I ask people questions they usually find
they're deeply grooved answers and I'm

7154
02:37:56,480 --> 02:37:56,490
they're deeply grooved answers and I'm
 

7155
02:37:56,490 --> 02:37:58,070
they're deeply grooved answers and I'm
not so interested in all of the deeply

7156
02:37:58,070 --> 02:37:58,080
not so interested in all of the deeply
 

7157
02:37:58,080 --> 02:37:59,630
not so interested in all of the deeply
grooved answers and so there's a

7158
02:37:59,630 --> 02:37:59,640
grooved answers and so there's a
 

7159
02:37:59,640 --> 02:38:01,610
grooved answers and so there's a
complaint which I'm very sympathetic to

7160
02:38:01,610 --> 02:38:01,620
complaint which I'm very sympathetic to
 

7161
02:38:01,620 --> 02:38:04,010
complaint which I'm very sympathetic to
actually that I talk over people that I

7162
02:38:04,010 --> 02:38:04,020
actually that I talk over people that I
 

7163
02:38:04,020 --> 02:38:05,840
actually that I talk over people that I
won't sit still for the answer and I

7164
02:38:05,840 --> 02:38:05,850
won't sit still for the answer and I
 

7165
02:38:05,850 --> 02:38:08,210
won't sit still for the answer and I
think that's weirdly sort of correct

7166
02:38:08,210 --> 02:38:08,220
think that's weirdly sort of correct
 

7167
02:38:08,220 --> 02:38:10,880
think that's weirdly sort of correct
it's not that I'm not interested in

7168
02:38:10,880 --> 02:38:10,890
it's not that I'm not interested in
 

7169
02:38:10,890 --> 02:38:13,250
it's not that I'm not interested in
hearing other voices it's that I'm not

7170
02:38:13,250 --> 02:38:13,260
hearing other voices it's that I'm not
 

7171
02:38:13,260 --> 02:38:15,170
hearing other voices it's that I'm not
interested in hearing the same voice on

02:38:15,170 --> 02:38:15,180
interested in hearing the same voice on
 

7173
02:38:15,180 --> 02:38:17,030
interested in hearing the same voice on
my program that I could have gotten on

02:38:17,030 --> 02:38:17,040
my program that I could have gotten on
 

7175
02:38:17,040 --> 02:38:19,010
my program that I could have gotten on
somebody else's and I haven't solved

7176
02:38:19,010 --> 02:38:19,020
somebody else's and I haven't solved
 

7177
02:38:19,020 --> 02:38:20,480
somebody else's and I haven't solved
that well so I've learned that I need a

02:38:20,480 --> 02:38:20,490
that well so I've learned that I need a
 

7179
02:38:20,490 --> 02:38:23,660
that well so I've learned that I need a
new conversational technique where I can

7180
02:38:23,660 --> 02:38:23,670
new conversational technique where I can
 

7181
02:38:23,670 --> 02:38:25,400
new conversational technique where I can

02:39:27,620 --> 02:39:27,630
subsisting and I think it also has to do
 

7237
02:39:27,630 --> 02:39:30,200
subsisting and I think it also has to do
with the fact that this has become a

7238
02:39:30,200 --> 02:39:30,210
with the fact that this has become a
 

7239
