gradual transition

642
00:11:28,710 --> 00:11:28,720
gradual transition
 

643
00:11:28,720 --> 00:11:32,710
gradual transition
from the initial revolutionary steps

644
00:11:32,710 --> 00:11:32,720
from the initial revolutionary steps
 

645
00:11:32,720 --> 00:11:35,509
from the initial revolutionary steps
of animals fighting for their freedom to

four legs good two legs bad two uh

652
00:11:44,470 --> 00:11:44,480
four legs good two legs bad two uh
 

653
00:11:44,480 --> 00:11:47,910
four legs good two legs bad two uh
four legs good two legs better

654
00:11:47,910 --> 00:11:47,920
four legs good two legs better
 

655
00:11:47,920 --> 00:11:49,990
four legs good two legs better
even better i think yeah like that they

656
00:11:49,990 --> 00:11:50,000
even better i think yeah like that they
 

657
00:11:50,000 --> 00:11:51,030
even better i think yeah like that they
were so like

658
00:11:51,030 --> 00:11:51,040
were so like
 

659
00:11:51,040 --> 00:11:53,430
were so like
gradually transitioning the ideology

660
00:11:53,430 --> 00:11:53,440
gradually transitioning the ideology
 

661
00:11:53,440 --> 00:11:55,590
gradually transitioning the ideology
under which the farm operates

662
00:11:55,590 --> 00:11:55,600
under which the farm operates
 

663
00:11:55,600 --> 00:11:59,509
under which the farm operates
and i think the gradual nature of that

664
00:11:59,509 --> 00:11:59,519
and i think the gradual nature of that
 

665
00:11:59,519 --> 00:12:01,750

like i i feel like home

00:26:26,070 --> 00:26:26,080
like i i feel like home
 

1479
00:26:26,080 --> 00:26:28,950
like i i feel like home
and i mean i was in south korea longer

1480
00:26:28,950 --> 00:26:28,960
and i mean i was in south korea longer

00:38:10,710 --> 00:38:10,720
terms of bioengineering in terms of like
 

2123
00:38:10,720 --> 00:38:12,390
terms of bioengineering in terms of like
all these efforts to help people from

2124
00:38:12,390 --> 00:38:12,400
all these efforts to help people from
 

2125
00:38:12,400 --> 00:38:14,470
all these efforts to help people from
disease but like

2126
00:38:14,470 --> 00:38:14,480
disease but like
 

2127
00:38:14,480 --> 00:38:16,069
disease but like
that's almost like converting into an

2128
00:38:16,069 --> 00:38:16,079
that's almost like converting into an
 

2129
00:38:16,079 --> 00:38:17,750
that's almost like converting into an
engineering problem and trying to solve

2130
00:38:17,750 --> 00:38:17,760
engineering problem and trying to solve
 

2131
00:38:17,760 --> 00:38:17,990
engineering problem and trying to solve
it

2132
00:38:17,990 --> 00:38:18,000
it
 

2133
00:38:18,000 --> 00:38:20,230
it
that somehow is easier for us humans but

2134
00:38:20,230 --> 00:38:20,240
that somehow is easier for us humans but
 

2135
00:38:20,240 --> 00:38:24,430
that somehow is easier for us humans but
when there's obvious sort of

korea
 

2145
00:38:34,480 --> 00:38:37,750
korea
yeah i mean that has to be changed

2146
00:38:37,750 --> 00:38:37,760
yeah i mean that has to be changed
 

2147
00:38:37,760 --> 00:38:38,710
yeah i mean that has to be changed
somehow

2148
00:38:38,710 --> 00:38:38,720
somehow
 

2149
00:38:38,720 --> 00:38:40,310
somehow
we'll have to change that somehow this

2150
00:38:40,310 --> 00:38:40,320
we'll have to change that somehow this
 

2151
00:38:40,320 --> 00:38:41,829
we'll have to change that somehow this
is the thing right now like

2152
00:38:41,829 --> 00:38:41,839
is the thing right now like
 

2153
00:38:41,839 --> 00:38:44,630
is the thing right now like
the china like they bring the xinjiang

vigors right dave

2156
00:38:46,550 --> 00:38:46,560
vigors right dave
 

2157
00:38:46,560 --> 00:38:49,030
vigors right dave
they say oh this vitamin take it and

2158
00:38:49,030 --> 00:38:49,040
they say oh this vitamin take it and
 

2159
00:38:49,040 --> 00:38:50,390
they say oh this vitamin take it and
then it kills their sperm

2160
00:38:50,390 --> 00:38:50,400
then it kills their sperm
 

2161
00:38:50,400 --> 00:38:52,710
then it kills their sperm
and make them not reproduce their birth

2162
00:38:52,710 --> 00:38:52,720
and make them not reproduce their birth
 

2163
00:38:52,720 --> 00:38:55,030
and make them not reproduce their birth
rate gone down something 47 to something

2164
00:38:55,030 --> 00:38:55,040
rate gone down something 47 to something
 

2165
00:38:55,040 --> 00:38:55,750

50
 

2167
00:38:55,760 --> 00:38:58,150

in the one year time it's a genocide in

2168
00:38:58,150 --> 00:38:58,160
in the one year time it's a genocide in
 

2169
00:38:58,160 --> 00:38:59,670
in the one year time it's a genocide in
21st century

2170
00:38:59,670 --> 00:38:59,680
21st century
 

2171
00:38:59,680 --> 00:39:01,829
21st century
and they get those people and get their

2172
00:39:01,829 --> 00:39:01,839
and they get those people and get their
 

2173
00:39:01,839 --> 00:39:03,750
and they get those people and get their
like organs out

2174
00:39:03,750 --> 00:39:03,760
like organs out
 

2175
00:39:03,760 --> 00:39:05,670
like organs out
imagine if there's some people who do

2176
00:39:05,670 --> 00:39:05,680
imagine if there's some people who do
 

2177
00:39:05,680 --> 00:39:08,710
imagine if there's some people who do
that with cutie puppies and cats

2178
00:39:08,710 --> 00:39:08,720
that with cutie puppies and cats
 

2179
00:39:08,720 --> 00:39:10,790
that with cutie puppies and cats
there's gonna be insane amount of

2180
00:39:10,790 --> 00:39:10,800
there's gonna be insane amount of
 

2181
00:39:10,800 --> 00:39:13,510
there's gonna be insane amount of
product they're gonna destroy everything

2182
00:39:13,510 --> 00:39:13,520
product they're gonna destroy everything
 

2183
00:39:13,520 --> 00:39:16,150
product they're gonna destroy everything
and this is like a human nature that i

2184
00:39:16,150 --> 00:39:16,160
and this is like a human nature that i
 

2185
00:39:16,160 --> 00:39:17,589
and this is like a human nature that i
don't get

2186
00:39:17,589 --> 00:39:17,599
don't get
 

2187
00:39:17,599 --> 00:39:20,230
don't get
why there's so much anti-human sentiment

2188
00:39:20,230 --> 00:39:20,240
why there's so much anti-human sentiment
 

2189
00:39:20,240 --> 00:39:22,150
why there's so much anti-human sentiment
in this modern world like we don't have

2190
00:39:22,150 --> 00:39:22,160
in this modern world like we don't have
 

2191
00:39:22,160 --> 00:39:23,190
in this modern world like we don't have
to like

2192
00:39:23,190 --> 00:39:23,200
to like
 

2193
00:39:23,200 --> 00:39:25,430
to like
the the fact that i was saying like the

2194
00:39:25,430 --> 00:39:25,440
the the fact that i was saying like the
 

2195
00:39:25,440 --> 00:39:27,270
the the fact that i was saying like the
fact that you care about animals rights

2196
00:39:27,270 --> 00:39:27,280
fact that you care about animals rights
 

2197
00:39:27,280 --> 00:39:29,349
fact that you care about animals rights
it's beautiful because you care about

2198
00:39:29,349 --> 00:39:29,359
it's beautiful because you care about
 

2199
00:39:29,359 --> 00:39:30,550
it's beautiful because you care about
something who cannot speak for

2200
00:39:30,550 --> 00:39:30,560
something who cannot speak for
 

2201
00:39:30,560 --> 00:39:31,670
something who cannot speak for
themselves

2202
00:39:31,670 --> 00:39:31,680
themselves
 

2203
00:39:31,680 --> 00:39:33,190
themselves
the fact that we care about animals is

2204
00:39:33,190 --> 00:39:33,200
the fact that we care about animals is
 

2205
00:39:33,200 --> 00:39:35,030
the fact that we care about animals is
because they cannot speak for themselves

2206
00:39:35,030 --> 00:39:35,040
because they cannot speak for themselves
 

2207
00:39:35,040 --> 00:39:37,190
because they cannot speak for themselves
right they don't have that

2208
00:39:37,190 --> 00:39:37,200
right they don't have that
 

2209
00:39:37,200 --> 00:39:39,349
right they don't have that
ability and there are many people who

2210
00:39:39,349 --> 00:39:39,359
ability and there are many people who
 

2211
00:39:39,359 --> 00:39:41,510
ability and there are many people who
cannot speak for themselves right now

2212
00:39:41,510 --> 00:39:41,520
cannot speak for themselves right now
 

2213
00:39:41,520 --> 00:39:43,829
cannot speak for themselves right now
and why do you refuse to be the voice

2214
00:39:43,829 --> 00:39:43,839
and why do you refuse to be the voice
 

2215
00:39:43,839 --> 00:39:44,550
and why do you refuse to be the voice
for them

2216
00:39:44,550 --> 00:39:44,560
for them
 

2217
00:39:44,560 --> 00:39:47,270
for them
because they're simply being a human and

2218
00:39:47,270 --> 00:39:47,280
because they're simply being a human and
 

2219
00:39:47,280 --> 00:39:49,910
because they're simply being a human and
maybe it connects to us

2220
00:39:49,910 --> 00:39:49,920
maybe it connects to us
 

2221
00:39:49,920 --> 00:39:53,190
maybe it connects to us
not being proud of who we are like maybe

2222
00:39:53,190 --> 00:39:53,200
not being proud of who we are like maybe
 

2223
00:39:53,200 --> 00:39:55,430
not being proud of who we are like maybe
i don't know what it is why do they deny

2224
00:39:55,430 --> 00:39:55,440
i don't know what it is why do they deny
 

2225
00:39:55,440 --> 00:39:56,310
i don't know what it is why do they deny
humans

2226
00:39:56,310 --> 00:39:56,320
humans
 

2227
00:39:56,320 --> 00:39:58,069
humans
this way maybe they don't like

2228
00:39:58,069 --> 00:39:58,079
this way maybe they don't like
 

2229
00:39:58,079 --> 00:39:59,829
this way maybe they don't like
themselves

2230
00:39:59,829 --> 00:39:59,839
themselves
 

2231
00:39:59,839 --> 00:40:03,030
themselves
yeah it's almost um we would have to

2232
00:40:03,030 --> 00:40:03,040
yeah it's almost um we would have to
 

2233
00:40:03,040 --> 00:40:04,390
yeah it's almost um we would have to
acknowledge some dark things about

2234
00:40:04,390 --> 00:40:04,400
acknowledge some dark things about
 

2235
00:40:04,400 --> 00:40:09,589
acknowledge some dark things about
ourselves in order to start helping

2236
00:40:09,589 --> 00:40:09,599

 

2237
00:40:09,599 --> 00:40:13,270

what's the solution so you know i see

2238
00:40:13,270 --> 00:40:13,280
what's the solution so you know i see
 

2239
00:40:13,280 --> 00:40:14,309
what's the solution so you know i see
two solutions

2240
00:40:14,309 --> 00:40:14,319
two solutions
 

2241
00:40:14,319 --> 00:40:17,510
two solutions
one is in the military side

2242
00:40:17,510 --> 00:40:17,520
one is in the military side
 

2243
00:40:17,520 --> 00:40:20,550
one is in the military side
yeah it's uh assassination

2244
00:40:20,550 --> 00:40:20,560
yeah it's uh assassination
 

2245
00:40:20,560 --> 00:40:23,990
yeah it's uh assassination
or the full-on invasion

2246
00:40:23,990 --> 00:40:24,000
or the full-on invasion
 

2247
00:40:24,000 --> 00:40:28,470
or the full-on invasion
and then on the activism side

2248
00:40:28,470 --> 00:40:28,480
and then on the activism side
 

2249
00:40:28,480 --> 00:40:33,510
and then on the activism side
which is figuring out ways to um

2250
00:40:33,510 --> 00:40:33,520
which is figuring out ways to um
 

2251
00:40:33,520 --> 00:40:36,790
which is figuring out ways to um
like like you said sort of let people in

2252
00:40:36,790 --> 00:40:36,800
like like you said sort of let people in
 

2253
00:40:36,800 --> 00:40:38,390
like like you said sort of let people in
north korea

2254
00:40:38,390 --> 00:40:38,400
north korea
 

2255
00:40:38,400 --> 00:40:40,630
north korea
understand their situation sort of from

2256
00:40:40,630 --> 00:40:40,640
understand their situation sort of from
 

2257
00:40:40,640 --> 00:40:42,950
understand their situation sort of from
within try to reform

2258
00:40:42,950 --> 00:40:42,960
within try to reform
 

2259
00:40:42,960 --> 00:40:44,790
within try to reform
or maybe there's others obviously there

2260
00:40:44,790 --> 00:40:44,800
or maybe there's others obviously there
 

2261
00:40:44,800 --> 00:40:46,390
or maybe there's others obviously there
could be activism

2262
00:40:46,390 --> 00:40:46,400
could be activism
 

2263
00:40:46,400 --> 00:40:49,109
could be activism
from the outside to build up momentum

2264
00:40:49,109 --> 00:40:49,119
from the outside to build up momentum
 

2265
00:40:49,119 --> 00:40:50,950
from the outside to build up momentum
for the entirety of the world

2266
00:40:50,950 --> 00:40:50,960
for the entirety of the world
 

2267
00:40:50,960 --> 00:40:53,829
for the entirety of the world
especially the world that it's not just

2268
00:40:53,829 --> 00:40:53,839
especially the world that it's not just
 

2269
00:40:53,839 --> 00:40:55,750
especially the world that it's not just
the united states or europe but also as

2270
00:40:55,750 --> 00:40:55,760
the united states or europe but also as
 

2271
00:40:55,760 --> 00:40:57,670
the united states or europe but also as
russia and china and so on

2272
00:40:57,670 --> 00:40:57,680
russia and china and so on
 

2273
00:40:57,680 --> 00:41:01,030
russia and china and so on
what what are your ideas here how we can

2274
00:41:01,030 --> 00:41:01,040
what what are your ideas here how we can
 

2275
00:41:01,040 --> 00:41:04,230
what what are your ideas here how we can
what we can do as individuals and as

2276
00:41:04,230 --> 00:41:04,240
what we can do as individuals and as
 

2277
00:41:04,240 --> 00:41:05,430
what we can do as individuals and as
countries

2278
00:41:05,430 --> 00:41:05,440
countries
 

2279
00:41:05,440 --> 00:41:07,349
countries
i think the first thing that we can do

2280
00:41:07,349 --> 00:41:07,359
i think the first thing that we can do
 

2281
00:41:07,359 --> 00:41:08,470
i think the first thing that we can do
is speak about

2282
00:41:08,470 --> 00:41:08,480
is speak about
 

2283
00:41:08,480 --> 00:41:10,470
is speak about

the most adaptable species on the planet
 

2663
00:47:47,520 --> 00:47:48,710
the most adaptable species on the planet
that's why we

2664

created the internet like talking this
 

2667

way right
 

2669
00:47:52,079 --> 00:47:53,589
way right
now other animals have done it because

2670
00:47:53,589 --> 00:47:53,599
now other animals have done it because

2676
00:48:00,710 --> 00:48:00,720
thing so in the adaptive situation
 

2677
00:48:00,720 --> 00:48:02,309
thing so in the adaptive situation
they all can be i mean during the

2683
00:48:06,400 --> 00:48:08,470
they could have been capable of good too
if they were exposed to different system

2684
00:48:08,470 --> 00:48:08,480
if they were exposed to different system

idea we don't want to isolate 1.3

2698
00:48:24,150 --> 00:48:24,160

2699
00:48:24,160 --> 00:48:27,190
idea we don't want to isolate 1.3

00:48:29,599 --> 00:48:30,549
chinese but the thing is we are talking
about this

2704
00:48:30,549 --> 00:48:30,559

2708
00:48:34,069 --> 00:48:34,079
people i speak chinese
 

2709
00:48:34,079 --> 00:48:36,870
people i speak chinese
i love like all about the country but

2710
00:48:36,870 --> 00:48:36,880
i love like all about the country but
 

2711
00:48:36,880 --> 00:48:37,829
i love like all about the country but
this system

2712
00:48:37,829 --> 00:48:37,839
this system
 

2713
00:48:37,839 --> 00:48:40,309
this system
does promote evil well that's an

2714
00:48:40,309 --> 00:48:40,319
does promote evil well that's an
 

2715
00:48:40,319 --> 00:48:42,230
does promote evil well that's an
optimistic view actually because

2716
00:48:42,230 --> 00:48:42,240
optimistic view actually because
 

2717
00:48:42,240 --> 00:48:45,589
optimistic view actually because
we can fix systems yeah it's harder to

2718
00:48:45,589 --> 00:48:45,599
we can fix systems yeah it's harder to
 

2719
00:48:45,599 --> 00:48:46,390
we can fix systems yeah it's harder to
fix people

2720
00:48:46,390 --> 00:48:46,400
fix people
 

2721
00:48:46,400 --> 00:48:48,230
fix people
so if we fix systems then the people are

2722
00:48:48,230 --> 00:48:48,240
so if we fix systems then the people are
 

2723
00:48:48,240 --> 00:48:50,069
so if we fix systems then the people are
adaptable absolutely as you said

2724
00:48:50,069 --> 00:48:50,079
adaptable absolutely as you said
 

2725
00:48:50,079 --> 00:48:52,390
adaptable absolutely as you said
i mean that and then the question is uh

2726
00:48:52,390 --> 00:48:52,400
i mean that and then the question is uh

talking about it
until there's until hopefully

2740
00:49:08,309 --> 00:49:08,319
until there's until hopefully
 

2741
00:49:08,319 --> 00:49:11,910
until there's until hopefully
leads to at the highest levels of power

2742
00:49:11,910 --> 00:49:11,920

01:09:16,309 --> 01:09:16,319
thing about freedom is
 

3897
01:09:16,319 --> 01:09:18,550
thing about freedom is
when you have freedom you also have the

3898
01:09:18,550 --> 01:09:18,560
when you have freedom you also have the
 

3899
01:09:18,560 --> 01:09:20,149
when you have freedom you also have the
responsibility for your actions

3900
01:09:20,149 --> 01:09:20,159
responsibility for your actions
 

3901
01:09:20,159 --> 01:09:23,030
responsibility for your actions
and that could be a huge burden yeah

3902
01:09:23,030 --> 01:09:23,040
and that could be a huge burden yeah
 

3903
01:09:23,040 --> 01:09:23,590
and that could be a huge burden yeah
because

3904
01:09:23,590 --> 01:09:23,600
because
 

3905
01:09:23,600 --> 01:09:27,430
because
um if you succeed it's you

3906
01:09:27,430 --> 01:09:27,440
um if you succeed it's you
 

3907

but if you fail it's you yeah and
 

3909
01:09:30,640 --> 01:09:32,950
but if you fail it's you yeah and
uh if you do horrible things it's you if

3910
01:09:32,950 --> 01:09:32,960
uh if you do horrible things it's you if
 

3911
01:09:32,960 --> 01:09:34,149
uh if you do horrible things it's you if
you don't do something

3912
01:09:34,149 --> 01:09:34,159
you don't do something
 

3913
01:09:34,159 --> 01:09:36,070
you don't do something
for example if you don't help people in

3914
01:09:36,070 --> 01:09:36,080
for example if you don't help people in
 

3915
01:09:36,080 --> 01:09:37,189
for example if you don't help people in
north korea it's you

3916
01:09:37,189 --> 01:09:37,199
north korea it's you
 

3917
01:09:37,199 --> 01:09:40,309
north korea it's you
yeah and that's a huge burden yeah

3918
01:09:40,309 --> 01:09:40,319
yeah and that's a huge burden yeah
 

3919
01:09:40,319 --> 01:09:43,430
yeah and that's a huge burden yeah
and living with that burden is a kind of

3920
01:09:43,430 --> 01:09:43,440
and living with that burden is a kind of
 

3921
01:09:43,440 --> 01:09:43,990
and living with that burden is a kind of
suffering

3922
01:09:43,990 --> 01:09:44,000
suffering
 

3923
01:09:44,000 --> 01:09:45,829
suffering
i mean there's some aspect in which

3924
01:09:45,829 --> 01:09:45,839
i mean there's some aspect in which
 

3925
01:09:45,839 --> 01:09:48,070
i mean there's some aspect in which
freedom is suffering it is suffering

3926
01:09:48,070 --> 01:09:48,080
freedom is suffering it is suffering
 

3927
01:09:48,080 --> 01:09:49,669
freedom is suffering it is suffering
because life is suffering and then

3928
01:09:49,669 --> 01:09:49,679
because life is suffering and then
 

3929
01:09:49,679 --> 01:09:51,590
because life is suffering and then
freedom is uh

3930
01:09:51,590 --> 01:09:51,600
freedom is uh
 

3931
01:09:51,600 --> 01:09:54,550
freedom is uh

freedom fully implemented in
in human societies meaning that humans

01:10:15,750 --> 01:10:15,760
in human societies meaning that humans
 

3951
01:10:15,760 --> 01:10:18,310
in human societies meaning that humans
should

3952
01:10:18,310 --> 01:10:18,320

 

3953
01:10:18,320 --> 01:10:21,669

all be free to choose how they

they live together
 

3959
01:10:25,679 --> 01:10:28,070
they live together
there shouldn't be a centralized force

3960
01:10:28,070 --> 01:10:28,080
there shouldn't be a centralized force
 

3961
01:10:28,080 --> 01:10:30,229
there shouldn't be a centralized force
that tells you what to do

3962
01:10:30,229 --> 01:10:30,239
that tells you what to do
 

3963
01:10:30,239 --> 01:10:32,149
that tells you what to do
do you think there's some role for

3964
01:10:32,149 --> 01:10:32,159
do you think there's some role for
 

3965
01:10:32,159 --> 01:10:33,590
do you think there's some role for
government

3966
01:10:33,590 --> 01:10:33,600
government
 

3967
01:10:33,600 --> 01:10:36,630
government
in um in a healthy society yeah so

3968
01:10:36,630 --> 01:10:36,640
in um in a healthy society yeah so
 

3969
01:10:36,640 --> 01:10:38,709
in um in a healthy society yeah so
you if we look at north korea there's

3970
01:10:38,709 --> 01:10:38,719
you if we look at north korea there's
 

3971
01:10:38,719 --> 01:10:41,350
you if we look at north korea there's
the most horrible implementation

3972
01:10:41,350 --> 01:10:41,360
the most horrible implementation
 

3973
01:10:41,360 --> 01:10:44,709
the most horrible implementation
of government but then if we

3974
01:10:44,709 --> 01:10:44,719
of government but then if we
 

3975
01:10:44,719 --> 01:10:46,390
of government but then if we
look at what the united states strives

3976
01:10:46,390 --> 01:10:46,400
look at what the united states strives
 

3977
01:10:46,400 --> 01:10:48,070
look at what the united states strives
to be at least

3978
01:10:48,070 --> 01:10:48,080
to be at least
 

3979
01:10:48,080 --> 01:10:51,350
to be at least
in principle there's uh there's an

3980
01:10:51,350 --> 01:10:51,360
in principle there's uh there's an
 

3981
01:10:51,360 --> 01:10:53,110
in principle there's uh there's an
ideal of a government that represents

3982
01:10:53,110 --> 01:10:53,120
ideal of a government that represents
 

3983
01:10:53,120 --> 01:10:54,870
ideal of a government that represents
the people and helps the people like is

3984
01:10:54,870 --> 01:10:54,880
the people and helps the people like is
 

3985
01:10:54,880 --> 01:10:56,630
the people and helps the people like is
there is there a place for that kind of

3986
01:10:56,630 --> 01:10:56,640
there is there a place for that kind of
 

3987
01:10:56,640 --> 01:10:57,270
there is there a place for that kind of
ideal

3988
01:10:57,270 --> 01:10:57,280
ideal
 

3989
01:10:57,280 --> 01:10:58,790
ideal
or is government always going to get us

3990
01:10:58,790 --> 01:10:58,800
or is government always going to get us
 

3991
01:10:58,800 --> 01:11:00,630
or is government always going to get us
into trouble i

3992
01:11:00,630 --> 01:11:00,640
into trouble i
 

3993
01:11:00,640 --> 01:11:03,590
into trouble i
am not i mean i spoke to michael males i

3994
01:11:03,590 --> 01:11:03,600
am not i mean i spoke to michael males i
 

3995
01:11:03,600 --> 01:11:04,630
am not i mean i spoke to michael males i
kept asking

3996
01:11:04,630 --> 01:11:04,640
kept asking
 

3997
01:11:04,640 --> 01:11:07,110
kept asking
why he's anarchist right and he doesn't

3998
01:11:07,110 --> 01:11:07,120
why he's anarchist right and he doesn't
 

3999
01:11:07,120 --> 01:11:10,070
why he's anarchist right and he doesn't
believe in military none of that

4000
01:11:10,070 --> 01:11:10,080
believe in military none of that
 

4001
01:11:10,080 --> 01:11:11,750
believe in military none of that
and it's i was like i was like i don't

4002
01:11:11,750 --> 01:11:11,760
and it's i was like i was like i don't
 

4003
01:11:11,760 --> 01:11:13,350
and it's i was like i was like i don't
think i want to be in that world

4004
01:11:13,350 --> 01:11:13,360
think i want to be in that world
 

4005
01:11:13,360 --> 01:11:15,830
think i want to be in that world
you're describing me that's pretty scary

4006
01:11:15,830 --> 01:11:15,840
you're describing me that's pretty scary
 

4007
01:11:15,840 --> 01:11:17,910
you're describing me that's pretty scary
i want the law enforcement

4008
01:11:17,910 --> 01:11:17,920
i want the law enforcement
 

4009
01:11:17,920 --> 01:11:21,030
i want the law enforcement
i want like i don't

4010
01:11:21,030 --> 01:11:21,040
i want like i don't
 

4011
01:11:21,040 --> 01:11:25,189
i want like i don't
in a way that so why equality makes no

4012
01:11:25,189 --> 01:11:25,199
in a way that so why equality makes no
 

4013
01:11:25,199 --> 01:11:26,229
in a way that so why equality makes no
sense is that

4014
01:11:26,229 --> 01:11:26,239
sense is that
 

4015
01:11:26,239 --> 01:11:28,229
sense is that
the fact that when you and i were born

4016
01:11:28,229 --> 01:11:28,239
the fact that when you and i were born
 

4017
01:11:28,239 --> 01:11:29,910
the fact that when you and i were born
we were born in a very different

4018
01:11:29,910 --> 01:11:29,920
we were born in a very different
 

4019
01:11:29,920 --> 01:11:31,590
we were born in a very different
capability of thinking

4020
01:11:31,590 --> 01:11:31,600
capability of thinking
 

4021
01:11:31,600 --> 01:11:33,110
capability of thinking
different intelligence different

4022
01:11:33,110 --> 01:11:33,120
different intelligence different
 

4023
01:11:33,120 --> 01:11:35,350
different intelligence different
capability in our physics right

4024
01:11:35,350 --> 01:11:35,360
capability in our physics right
 

4025
01:11:35,360 --> 01:11:37,590
capability in our physics right
so equality is nonsense you can never

4026
01:11:37,590 --> 01:11:37,600
so equality is nonsense you can never
 

4027
01:11:37,600 --> 01:11:39,189
so equality is nonsense you can never
achieve that

4028
01:11:39,189 --> 01:11:39,199
achieve that
 

4029
01:11:39,199 --> 01:11:42,630
achieve that
right so to me that's when it's very

4030
01:11:42,630 --> 01:11:42,640
right so to me that's when it's very
 

4031
01:11:42,640 --> 01:11:43,430
right so to me that's when it's very
scary

4032
01:11:43,430 --> 01:11:43,440
scary
 

4033
01:11:43,440 --> 01:11:45,350
scary
when the government tries to interforce

4034
01:11:45,350 --> 01:11:45,360
when the government tries to interforce
 

4035
01:11:45,360 --> 01:11:47,590
when the government tries to interforce
equality on everybody that is

4036
01:11:47,590 --> 01:11:47,600
equality on everybody that is
 

4037
01:11:47,600 --> 01:11:49,510
equality on everybody that is
impossible that's specifically equality

4038
01:11:49,510 --> 01:11:49,520
impossible that's specifically equality
 

4039
01:11:49,520 --> 01:11:50,870
impossible that's specifically equality
of outcomes so like

4040
01:11:50,870 --> 01:11:50,880
of outcomes so like
 

4041
01:11:50,880 --> 01:11:52,630
of outcomes so like
so given that we all started different

4042
01:11:52,630 --> 01:11:52,640
so given that we all started different
 

4043
01:11:52,640 --> 01:11:54,310
so given that we all started different
places enforce

4044
01:11:54,310 --> 01:11:54,320
places enforce
 

4045
01:11:54,320 --> 01:11:56,790
places enforce
like measure in some kind of way where

4046
01:11:56,790 --> 01:11:56,800
like measure in some kind of way where
 

4047
01:11:56,800 --> 01:11:59,030
like measure in some kind of way where
people stand and if they're on equal in

4048
01:11:59,030 --> 01:11:59,040
people stand and if they're on equal in
 

4049
01:11:59,040 --> 01:12:00,149
people stand and if they're on equal in
force equality

4050
01:12:00,149 --> 01:12:00,159
force equality
 

4051
01:12:00,159 --> 01:12:01,830
force equality
yeah and that's what leads to the kind

4052
01:12:01,830 --> 01:12:01,840
yeah and that's what leads to the kind
 

4053
01:12:01,840 --> 01:12:03,669
yeah and that's what leads to the kind
of things that you mentioned with the

4054
01:12:03,669 --> 01:12:03,679
of things that you mentioned with the
 

4055
01:12:03,679 --> 01:12:04,790
of things that you mentioned with the
class system

4056
01:12:04,790 --> 01:12:04,800
class system
 

4057
01:12:04,800 --> 01:12:08,070
class system

classmates right they that kind of
 

4223
01:14:50,719 --> 01:14:52,550
classmates right they that kind of
enforces the separation because there's

4224
01:14:52,550 --> 01:14:52,560
enforces the separation because there's
 

4225
01:14:52,560 --> 01:14:55,910
enforces the separation because there's
huge disincentives to go uh to marry to

huge disincentives to go uh to marry to
to

4228
01:14:56,550 --> 01:14:56,560

4229
01:14:56,560 --> 01:15:00,149
to
integrate between classes yeah

4230
01:15:00,149 --> 01:15:00,159
integrate between classes yeah
 

4231
01:15:00,159 --> 01:15:02,870
integrate between classes yeah
what do you do about this kind of um you

4232
01:15:02,870 --> 01:15:02,880
what do you do about this kind of um you
 

4233
01:15:02,880 --> 01:15:03,189
what do you do about this kind of um you
know

4234
01:15:03,189 --> 01:15:03,199
know
 

4235
01:15:03,199 --> 01:15:04,790
know
especially in universities but in

4236
01:15:04,790 --> 01:15:04,800
especially in universities but in
 

4237
01:15:04,800 --> 01:15:06,550
especially in universities but in
companies i'm

4238
01:15:06,550 --> 01:15:06,560
companies i'm
 

4239
01:15:06,560 --> 01:15:08,470
companies i'm
thinking about starting a company so i'm

4240
01:15:08,470 --> 01:15:08,480
thinking about starting a company so i'm
 

4241
01:15:08,480 --> 01:15:10,070
thinking about starting a company so i'm
looking at this very carefully

4242
01:15:10,070 --> 01:15:10,080
looking at this very carefully
 

4243
01:15:10,080 --> 01:15:13,110
looking at this very carefully
there's these ideas of diversity

4244
01:15:13,110 --> 01:15:13,120
there's these ideas of diversity
 

4245
01:15:13,120 --> 01:15:16,229
there's these ideas of diversity
and and meritocracy that's a tension so

4246
01:15:16,229 --> 01:15:16,239
and and meritocracy that's a tension so
 

4247
01:15:16,239 --> 01:15:19,430
and and meritocracy that's a tension so
yeah i think there's

4248
01:15:19,430 --> 01:15:19,440
yeah i think there's
 

4249
01:15:19,440 --> 01:15:21,750
yeah i think there's
there's a big way in which diversity

4250
01:15:21,750 --> 01:15:21,760
there's a big way in which diversity
 

4251
01:15:21,760 --> 01:15:23,189
there's a big way in which diversity
broadly defined

4252
01:15:23,189 --> 01:15:23,199
broadly defined
 

4253
01:15:23,199 --> 01:15:26,229
broadly defined
is not at all in in tension with

4254
01:15:26,229 --> 01:15:26,239
is not at all in in tension with
 

4255
01:15:26,239 --> 01:15:30,390
is not at all in in tension with
meritocracy so having a variety of

4256
01:15:30,390 --> 01:15:30,400
meritocracy so having a variety of
 

4257
01:15:30,400 --> 01:15:31,110

4259
01:15:31,120 --> 01:15:33,030

backgrounds way of thinking all those

4260
01:15:33,030 --> 01:15:33,040
backgrounds way of thinking all those
 

4261
01:15:33,040 --> 01:15:36,550

kinds of things is a huge benefit to any

good at mathematics are you somebody

4298
01:16:14,229 --> 01:16:14,239
good at mathematics are you somebody
 

4299
01:16:14,239 --> 01:16:15,830
good at mathematics are you somebody
who's exceptionally good at psychology

4300
01:16:15,830 --> 01:16:15,840
who's exceptionally good at psychology
 

4301
01:16:15,840 --> 01:16:16,950
who's exceptionally good at psychology
are you good with people

4302
01:16:16,950 --> 01:16:16,960
are you good with people
 

4303
01:16:16,960 --> 01:16:18,630
are you good with people
are you good with numbers all that kind

4304
01:16:18,630 --> 01:16:18,640
are you good with numbers all that kind
 

4305
01:16:18,640 --> 01:16:21,669
are you good with numbers all that kind
of stuff that i think spans

4306
01:16:21,669 --> 01:16:21,679
of stuff that i think spans
 

4307
01:16:21,679 --> 01:16:24,310
of stuff that i think spans
or intersects in fascinating ways with

4308
01:16:24,310 --> 01:16:24,320
or intersects in fascinating ways with
 

4309
01:16:24,320 --> 01:16:25,350

these kinds of groups
 

4311
01:16:25,360 --> 01:16:28,149
these kinds of groups
so that's diversity and then meritocracy

4312
01:16:28,149 --> 01:16:28,159
so that's diversity and then meritocracy
 

4313
01:16:28,159 --> 01:16:29,030
so that's diversity and then meritocracy
is this

4314
01:16:29,030 --> 01:16:29,040
is this

thing that probably the reason i wanted
 

4317
01:16:32,080 --> 01:16:33,910
thing that probably the reason i wanted
to move to silicon valley and the reason

4318
01:16:33,910 --> 01:16:33,920
to move to silicon valley and the reason
 

4319
01:16:33,920 --> 01:16:35,350
to move to silicon valley and the reason
i didn't is like

4320
01:16:35,350 --> 01:16:35,360
i didn't is like
 

4321

yeah some keep kids have no ability to
 

4379
01:17:37,600 --> 01:17:39,750
yeah some keep kids have no ability to
do math so why do we have to force them

4380
01:17:39,750 --> 01:17:39,760
do math so why do we have to force them
 

4381
01:17:39,760 --> 01:17:41,990
do math so why do we have to force them
to learn math and that's what comes with

4382

01:19:18,470 --> 01:19:18,480
this is a regression of civilization
 

4477
01:19:18,480 --> 01:19:21,510
this is a regression of civilization
we are regressing as a humanity here

4478

things made us so much
brighter and looking forward and now we

4484
01:19:27,110 --> 01:19:27,120
brighter and looking forward and now we
 

4485
01:19:27,120 --> 01:19:28,550
brighter and looking forward and now we
are going backwards

4486
01:19:28,550 --> 01:19:28,560
are going backwards
 

4487
01:19:28,560 --> 01:19:30,390
are going backwards
well i think it's there's a pendulum

4488
01:19:30,390 --> 01:19:30,400
well i think it's there's a pendulum
 

4489
01:19:30,400 --> 01:19:32,149
well i think it's there's a pendulum
aspect to it because it's my it's my

4490
01:19:32,149 --> 01:19:32,159
aspect to it because it's my it's my
 

4491
01:19:32,159 --> 01:19:33,510
aspect to it because it's my it's my
hope in terms of backwards so

4492
01:19:33,510 --> 01:19:33,520
hope in terms of backwards so
 

4493
01:19:33,520 --> 01:19:35,669
hope in terms of backwards so
pendulum goes backwards too but it just

4494
01:19:35,669 --> 01:19:35,679
pendulum goes backwards too but it just
 

4495
01:19:35,679 --> 01:19:37,430
pendulum goes backwards too but it just
goes back and forth i think

4496
01:19:37,430 --> 01:19:37,440
goes back and forth i think
 

4497
01:19:37,440 --> 01:19:39,830
goes back and forth i think
and then uh in the long arc of history

4498
01:19:39,830 --> 01:19:39,840
and then uh in the long arc of history
 

4499
01:19:39,840 --> 01:19:41,510
and then uh in the long arc of history
we're making progress

4500
01:19:41,510 --> 01:19:41,520
we're making progress
 

4501
01:19:41,520 --> 01:19:44,070
we're making progress
i think all of the discussions of

4502
01:19:44,070 --> 01:19:44,080
i think all of the discussions of
 

4503
01:19:44,080 --> 01:19:45,110
i think all of the discussions of
diversity and

4504
01:19:45,110 --> 01:19:45,120
diversity and
 

4505
01:19:45,120 --> 01:19:47,510
diversity and
inclusion and all those kinds of things

4506
01:19:47,510 --> 01:19:47,520
inclusion and all those kinds of things
 

4507
01:19:47,520 --> 01:19:49,189
inclusion and all those kinds of things
i always thought that they're healthy

4508
01:19:49,189 --> 01:19:49,199
i always thought that they're healthy
 

4509
01:19:49,199 --> 01:19:52,070
i always thought that they're healthy
in a in moderation right they should be

4510
01:19:52,070 --> 01:19:52,080
in a in moderation right they should be
 

4511
01:19:52,080 --> 01:19:54,550
in a in moderation right they should be
a small part of the conversation amongst

4512
01:19:54,550 --> 01:19:54,560
a small part of the conversation amongst
 

4513
01:19:54,560 --> 01:19:57,669
a small part of the conversation amongst
other things the the natural asp

4514
01:19:57,669 --> 01:19:57,679
other things the the natural asp
 

4515
01:19:57,679 --> 01:20:00,149
other things the the natural asp
like it seems that they kind of have

4516
01:20:00,149 --> 01:20:00,159
like it seems that they kind of have
 

4517
01:20:00,159 --> 01:20:01,590
like it seems that they kind of have
this way of just consuming all

4518
01:20:01,590 --> 01:20:01,600
this way of just consuming all
 

4519
01:20:01,600 --> 01:20:02,870
this way of just consuming all
conversations

4520
01:20:02,870 --> 01:20:02,880
conversations
 

4521
01:20:02,880 --> 01:20:05,430
conversations
it's like the meetings like diversity

4522
01:20:05,430 --> 01:20:05,440
it's like the meetings like diversity
 

4523
01:20:05,440 --> 01:20:07,669
it's like the meetings like diversity
and inclusion meetings multiply somehow

4524
01:20:07,669 --> 01:20:07,679
and inclusion meetings multiply somehow
 

4525
01:20:07,679 --> 01:20:08,950
and inclusion meetings multiply somehow
where it's like the only thing that

4526
01:20:08,950 --> 01:20:08,960
where it's like the only thing that
 

4527
01:20:08,960 --> 01:20:11,030
where it's like the only thing that
you're talking about it's very kind of

4528
01:20:11,030 --> 01:20:11,040
you're talking about it's very kind of
 

4529
01:20:11,040 --> 01:20:13,030
you're talking about it's very kind of
absurd and when i look at uh

4530
01:20:13,030 --> 01:20:13,040
absurd and when i look at uh
 

4531
01:20:13,040 --> 01:20:15,830
absurd and when i look at uh
even at mit it's it's it's a strangely

4532
01:20:15,830 --> 01:20:15,840
even at mit it's it's it's a strangely
 

4533
01:20:15,840 --> 01:20:17,350
even at mit it's it's it's a strangely
disproportionate

4534
01:20:17,350 --> 01:20:17,360
disproportionate
 

4535
01:20:17,360 --> 01:20:20,390
disproportionate
amount of discussions about that and

4536
01:20:20,390 --> 01:20:20,400
amount of discussions about that and
 

4537
01:20:20,400 --> 01:20:22,870
amount of discussions about that and
also to me as an engineer those

4538
01:20:22,870 --> 01:20:22,880
also to me as an engineer those
 

4539
01:20:22,880 --> 01:20:24,709
also to me as an engineer those
discussions are very frustrating because

4540
01:20:24,709 --> 01:20:24,719
discussions are very frustrating because

you can put that self-censorship like
 

4723

i'm still nevertheless sort of hopeful
 

4745
01:23:47,120 --> 01:23:47,990
i'm still nevertheless sort of hopeful
but at the same

4746

but at the same
 

4747
01:23:48,000 --> 01:23:51,830
but at the same
time i'm i'm surrounded by engineers

4748
01:23:51,830 --> 01:23:51,840
time i'm i'm surrounded by engineers
 

4749
01:23:51,840 --> 01:23:53,590

i still sort of in defense of psychology
 

4767
01:24:12,719 --> 01:24:16,149
i still sort of in defense of psychology
i still i wish he had more numbers yeah

4768
01:24:16,149 --> 01:24:16,159
i still i wish he had more numbers yeah
 

4769
01:24:16,159 --> 01:24:18,709
i still i wish he had more numbers yeah
uh but i still feel like most psychology

4770
01:24:18,709 --> 01:24:18,719
uh but i still feel like most psychology
 

4771

research
 

4779
01:24:24,560 --> 01:24:26,470
research
we're just highlighting this what

we're just highlighting this what
 

4781
01:24:26,480 --> 01:24:27,590
we're just highlighting this what
america does well

4782

america does well
 

4783
01:24:27,600 --> 01:24:29,590
america does well
you're kind of highlighting anecdotal

4784
01:24:29,590 --> 01:24:29,600
you're kind of highlighting anecdotal
 

4785
01:24:29,600 --> 01:24:31,430
you're kind of highlighting anecdotal
experiences

4786
01:24:31,430 --> 01:24:31,440
experiences
 

4787
01:24:31,440 --> 01:24:35,750
experiences
and uh making a big deal out of them

4788
01:24:35,750 --> 01:24:35,760
and uh making a big deal out of them
 

4789
01:24:35,760 --> 01:24:37,510
and uh making a big deal out of them
but that's good because like it's a

4790
01:24:37,510 --> 01:24:37,520
but that's good because like it's a
 

4791
01:24:37,520 --> 01:24:38,790
but that's good because like it's a
slippery slope if those

4792
01:24:38,790 --> 01:24:38,800
slippery slope if those
 

4793
01:24:38,800 --> 01:24:40,550
slippery slope if those
if those things start to overtake all of

4794
01:24:40,550 --> 01:24:40,560
if those things start to overtake all of
 

4795
01:24:40,560 --> 01:24:42,070
if those things start to overtake all of
academia it starts becoming a big

4796
01:24:42,070 --> 01:24:42,080
academia it starts becoming a big
 

4797
01:24:42,080 --> 01:24:44,310
academia it starts becoming a big
problem even in the engineering field so

4798
01:24:44,310 --> 01:24:44,320
problem even in the engineering field so
 

4799
01:24:44,320 --> 01:24:46,550
problem even in the engineering field so
we should be concerned but it is truly

4800
01:24:46,550 --> 01:24:46,560
we should be concerned but it is truly
 

4801
01:24:46,560 --> 01:24:48,709
we should be concerned but it is truly
tragic that somebody who's

doesn't matter we were talking about

4856
01:25:49,750 --> 01:25:49,760
doesn't matter we were talking about
 

4857
01:25:49,760 --> 01:25:51,910
doesn't matter we were talking about
classic art and that's the thing

4858
01:25:51,910 --> 01:25:51,920
classic art and that's the thing
 

4859
01:25:51,920 --> 01:25:53,750
classic art and that's the thing
i literally thought okay i pushed it

4860
01:25:53,750 --> 01:25:53,760
i literally thought okay i pushed it
 

4861
01:25:53,760 --> 01:25:55,669
i literally thought okay i pushed it
last like the semester the call like the

4862
01:25:55,669 --> 01:25:55,679
last like the semester the call like the
 

4863
01:25:55,679 --> 01:25:57,110
last like the semester the call like the
art and music right

4864
01:25:57,110 --> 01:25:57,120
art and music right
 

4865
01:25:57,120 --> 01:25:58,310
art and music right
so i thought this is going to be the

4866
01:25:58,310 --> 01:25:58,320
so i thought this is going to be the
 

4867

think that's uh

5028
01:28:48,550 --> 01:28:48,560

that's what what i've been getting
 

5039
01:28:58,800 --> 01:29:00,550
that's what what i've been getting
scared because

want to give the power to them and
they're going to decide

5046
01:29:06,550 --> 01:29:06,560

5053
01:29:11,600 --> 01:29:13,430
promo is good and then they might come
back next year so you're probably

5054
01:29:13,430 --> 01:29:13,440
back next year so you're probably
 

5055
01:29:13,440 --> 01:29:15,590
back next year so you're probably
bad what are you gonna do when that

5056
01:29:15,590 --> 01:29:15,600
bad what are you gonna do when that
 

5057
01:29:15,600 --> 01:29:16,790

happens to you

5058
01:29:16,790 --> 01:29:16,800

we have to almost like get ideas out and

5060
01:29:19,350 --> 01:29:19,360
we have to almost like get ideas out and
 

5061
01:29:19,360 --> 01:29:20,470
we have to almost like get ideas out and
then play with them

5062
01:29:20,470 --> 01:29:20,480
then play with them
 

5063
01:29:20,480 --> 01:29:21,830
then play with them
i think what's a really important

5064
01:29:21,830 --> 01:29:21,840
i think what's a really important
 

5065
01:29:21,840 --> 01:29:23,510
i think what's a really important
component of that is forgiving each

5066
01:29:23,510 --> 01:29:23,520
component of that is forgiving each
 

5067
01:29:23,520 --> 01:29:24,629
component of that is forgiving each
other for

5068
01:29:24,629 --> 01:29:24,639
other for
 

5069
01:29:24,639 --> 01:29:27,830
other for
like realizing the word different person

5070
01:29:27,830 --> 01:29:27,840
like realizing the word different person
 

5071
01:29:27,840 --> 01:29:31,350
like realizing the word different person
day by day and certainly years later

5072
01:29:31,350 --> 01:29:31,360
day by day and certainly years later
 

5073
01:29:31,360 --> 01:29:34,070
day by day and certainly years later
and i think some of that is both

5074
01:29:34,070 --> 01:29:34,080
and i think some of that is both
 

5075
01:29:34,080 --> 01:29:36,229
and i think some of that is both
cultural mechanisms of saying like we

5076
01:29:36,229 --> 01:29:36,239
cultural mechanisms of saying like we
 

5077
01:29:36,239 --> 01:29:36,870
cultural mechanisms of saying like we
forgive

5078
01:29:36,870 --> 01:29:36,880
forgive
 

5079
01:29:36,880 --> 01:29:39,350
forgive
each other for wrong ideas or not wrong

5080
01:29:39,350 --> 01:29:39,360
each other for wrong ideas or not wrong
 

5081
01:29:39,360 --> 01:29:40,149
each other for wrong ideas or not wrong
ideas but

5082
01:29:40,149 --> 01:29:40,159
ideas but
 

5083
01:29:40,159 --> 01:29:42,950
ideas but
for who we are the the full evolution of

5084
01:29:42,950 --> 01:29:42,960
for who we are the the full evolution of
 

5085
01:29:42,960 --> 01:29:43,910
for who we are the the full evolution of
the human being

5086
01:29:43,910 --> 01:29:43,920
the human being
 

5087
01:29:43,920 --> 01:29:45,270
the human being
for the steps we've taken on that

5088
01:29:45,270 --> 01:29:45,280
for the steps we've taken on that
 

5089
01:29:45,280 --> 01:29:47,110
for the steps we've taken on that
evolution and

5090
01:29:47,110 --> 01:29:47,120
evolution and
 

5091
01:29:47,120 --> 01:29:50,229
evolution and
also creating mechanisms that

5092
01:29:50,229 --> 01:29:50,239
also creating mechanisms that
 

5093
01:29:50,239 --> 01:29:53,590
also creating mechanisms that
allow you to um allow

01:29:53,590 --> 01:29:53,600
allow you to um allow
 

5095
01:29:53,600 --> 01:29:54,950

example on a twitter is like horrible
 

5099
01:29:57,280 --> 01:29:58,870
example on a twitter is like horrible
with this because

5100
01:29:58,870 --> 01:29:58,880
with this because
 

5101
01:29:58,880 --> 01:30:01,510
with this because
one of the main viral ways that people

5102
01:30:01,510 --> 01:30:01,520
one of the main viral ways that people
 

5103
01:30:01,520 --> 01:30:03,510
one of the main viral ways that people
create drama on twitter is like

5104
01:30:03,510 --> 01:30:03,520
create drama on twitter is like
 

5105
01:30:03,520 --> 01:30:06,149
create drama on twitter is like
pulling up an old tweet that somebody

5106
01:30:06,149 --> 01:30:06,159
pulling up an old tweet that somebody
 

5107
01:30:06,159 --> 01:30:07,110
pulling up an old tweet that somebody
said right

5108
01:30:07,110 --> 01:30:07,120
said right
 

5109
01:30:07,120 --> 01:30:09,189
said right
and then saying oh this is the guy that

5110
01:30:09,189 --> 01:30:09,199
and then saying oh this is the guy that
 

5111
01:30:09,199 --> 01:30:10,709
and then saying oh this is the guy that
thinks that yeah

5112
01:30:10,709 --> 01:30:10,719
thinks that yeah
 

5113
01:30:10,719 --> 01:30:12,709
thinks that yeah
and but that's like the opposite of the

5114
01:30:12,709 --> 01:30:12,719
and but that's like the opposite of the
 

5115
01:30:12,719 --> 01:30:14,310
and but that's like the opposite of the
mechanisms we need

5116
01:30:14,310 --> 01:30:14,320
mechanisms we need
 

5117
01:30:14,320 --> 01:30:16,470
mechanisms we need
to forgive ourselves forgive each other

5118
01:30:16,470 --> 01:30:16,480
to forgive ourselves forgive each other
 

5119
01:30:16,480 --> 01:30:19,750
to forgive ourselves forgive each other
for the things we've said in the past

5121
01:30:19,760 --> 01:30:22,229
for the things we've said in the past
um so part of that is the cultural part

5122
01:30:22,229 --> 01:30:22,239
um so part of that is the cultural part
 

5123
01:30:22,239 --> 01:30:23,270
um so part of that is the cultural part
of this is as

5124
01:30:23,270 --> 01:30:23,280
of this is as
 

5125
01:30:23,280 --> 01:30:26,629
of this is as
is the um the technological um

after constructing a lot of security

6720
01:58:18,550 --> 01:58:18,560
after constructing a lot of security
 

6721
01:58:18,560 --> 01:58:19,990
after constructing a lot of security
teams like now north korea

6722
01:58:19,990 --> 01:58:20,000
teams like now north korea
 

6723

teams like now north korea
became less smarter like you said they

6724
01:58:22,550 --> 01:58:22,560
became less smarter like you said they
 

6725
01:58:22,560 --> 01:58:24,229
became less smarter like you said they
may be more disguised as a like a

6726
01:58:24,229 --> 01:58:24,239
may be more disguised as a like a
 

6727
01:58:24,239 --> 01:58:25,350
may be more disguised as a like a
suicide

6728
01:58:25,350 --> 01:58:25,360
suicide
 

6729
01:58:25,360 --> 01:58:27,910
suicide
and a car accident yeah so when i die

6730
01:58:27,910 --> 01:58:27,920
and a car accident yeah so when i die

01:58:29,520 --> 01:58:33,270
they don't even know i got killed
yeah i think that's a higher chance so

6734
01:58:33,270 --> 01:58:33,280
yeah i think that's a higher chance so
 

6735
01:58:33,280 --> 01:58:35,510
yeah i think that's a higher chance so
i think that's the thing like people are

6736
01:58:35,510 --> 01:58:35,520
i think that's the thing like people are
 

6737
01:58:35,520 --> 01:58:37,109
i think that's the thing like people are
suffering take it or not it's

6738
01:58:37,109 --> 01:58:37,119
suffering take it or not it's
 

6739
01:58:37,119 --> 01:58:39,510
suffering take it or not it's
your choice and at least it's my

6740
01:58:39,510 --> 01:58:39,520
your choice and at least it's my
 

6741
01:58:39,520 --> 01:58:41,109
your choice and at least it's my
responsibility for them to know what's

6742
01:58:41,109 --> 01:58:41,119
responsibility for them to know what's
 

6743
01:58:41,119 --> 01:58:42,229
responsibility for them to know what's
going on

6744
01:58:42,229 --> 01:58:42,239
going on
 

6745
01:58:42,239 --> 01:58:43,910
going on
i think if you did not know and didn't

6746
01:58:43,910 --> 01:58:43,920
i think if you did not know and didn't
 

6747
01:58:43,920 --> 01:58:45,510
i think if you did not know and didn't
do anything you are not even guilty of a

6748
01:58:45,510 --> 01:58:45,520
do anything you are not even guilty of a
 

6749
01:58:45,520 --> 01:58:46,390
do anything you are not even guilty of a
thing

6750
01:58:46,390 --> 01:58:46,400
thing
 

6751
01:58:46,400 --> 01:58:48,709
thing
but once you know then you are not doing

6752
01:58:48,709 --> 01:58:48,719
but once you know then you are not doing
 

6753
01:58:48,719 --> 01:58:50,070
but once you know then you are not doing
it then you

6754
01:58:50,070 --> 01:58:50,080
it then you
 

6755
01:58:50,080 --> 01:58:52,950
it then you
something is like not right so that's

6756
01:58:52,950 --> 01:58:52,960

01:58:52,960 --> 01:58:54,149
something is like not right so that's
what i'm doing like

6758
01:58:54,149 --> 01:58:54,159

6759
01:58:54,159 --> 01:58:57,910
what i'm doing like
i want the people to know and then

6760
01:58:57,910 --> 01:58:57,920

6761
01:58:57,920 --> 01:58:59,990

time because we have been so dehumanized

6774
01:59:14,470 --> 01:59:14,480
time because we have been so dehumanized
 

6775
01:59:14,480 --> 01:59:16,470
time because we have been so dehumanized
right like we are like looking like
