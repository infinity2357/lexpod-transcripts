understanding ourselves it's all feeding
through US yeah yeah but it's a tricky

166
00:03:19,009 --> 00:03:19,019
through US yeah yeah but it's a tricky
 

167
00:03:19,019 --> 00:03:22,070
through US yeah yeah but it's a tricky
thing to step away and look at your mind

168
00:03:22,070 --> 00:03:22,080
thing to step away and look at your mind
 

169
00:03:22,080 --> 00:03:24,470
thing to step away and look at your mind
and understand that it's just a machine

170
00:03:24,470 --> 00:03:24,480
and understand that it's just a machine
 

171
00:03:24,480 --> 00:03:26,570
and understand that it's just a machine
and you can kind of control the way the

172
00:03:26,570 --> 00:03:26,580
and you can kind of control the way the
 

173
00:03:26,580 --> 00:03:28,250
and you can kind of control the way the
machine processes the external

174
00:03:28,250 --> 00:03:28,260
machine processes the external
 

175
00:03:28,260 --> 00:03:31,190
machine processes the external
environment and the way that machine

176
00:03:31,190 --> 00:03:31,200
environment and the way that machine
 

177
00:03:31,200 --> 00:03:33,589
environment and the way that machine
converts the things it perceives into

178
00:03:33,589 --> 00:03:33,599
converts the things it perceives into
 

179
00:03:33,599 --> 00:03:36,470
converts the things it perceives into
actual emotions like how it interprets

180
00:03:36,470 --> 00:03:36,480
actual emotions like how it interprets
 

181
00:03:36,480 --> 00:03:38,809
actual emotions like how it interprets
the things it perceives you just sort of

182
00:03:38,809 --> 00:03:38,819
the things it perceives you just sort of
 

183
00:03:38,819 --> 00:03:41,390
the things it perceives you just sort of
step away and analyze it in that way and

184
00:03:41,390 --> 00:03:41,400
step away and analyze it in that way and
 

185
00:03:41,400 --> 00:03:43,910
step away and analyze it in that way and
then you can control it you can you can

186
00:03:43,910 --> 00:03:43,920
then you can control it you can you can
 

187
00:03:43,920 --> 00:03:45,770
then you can control it you can you can
oil the machine you can control how it

188
00:03:45,770 --> 00:03:45,780
oil the machine you can control how it
 

189
00:03:45,780 --> 00:03:47,630
oil the machine you can control how it
actually interprets the Perceptions in

190
00:03:47,630 --> 00:03:47,640
actually interprets the Perceptions in
 

191
00:03:47,640 --> 00:03:49,910
actually interprets the Perceptions in
order to generate positive emotions and

192
00:03:49,910 --> 00:03:49,920
order to generate positive emotions and
 

193
00:03:49,920 --> 00:03:52,670
order to generate positive emotions and
be like a what is it like a mechanic

194
00:03:52,670 --> 00:03:52,680
be like a what is it like a mechanic
 

195
00:03:52,680 --> 00:03:55,490
be like a what is it like a mechanic
for the for the gears in the machine

196
00:03:55,490 --> 00:03:55,500
for the for the gears in the machine
 

197
00:03:55,500 --> 00:03:57,470
for the for the gears in the machine
I mean I think to some degree to some

198
00:03:57,470 --> 00:03:57,480
I mean I think to some degree to some
 

199
00:03:57,480 --> 00:03:59,990
I mean I think to some degree to some
degree of it the difference I think at

200
00:03:59,990 --> 00:04:00,000
degree of it the difference I think at
 

201
00:04:00,000 --> 00:04:02,330
degree of it the difference I think at
least is I understand I think of

202
00:04:02,330 --> 00:04:02,340
least is I understand I think of
 

203
00:04:02,340 --> 00:04:05,210
least is I understand I think of
machines as not being inscrutable right

204
00:04:05,210 --> 00:04:05,220
machines as not being inscrutable right
 

205
00:04:05,220 --> 00:04:07,910
machines as not being inscrutable right
that that if there's enough study

206
00:04:07,910 --> 00:04:07,920
that that if there's enough study
 

207
00:04:07,920 --> 00:04:11,509
that that if there's enough study
there's enough Acumen applied that we

208
00:04:11,509 --> 00:04:11,519
there's enough Acumen applied that we
 

209
00:04:11,519 --> 00:04:12,710
there's enough Acumen applied that we
can understand whatever it is we're

210
00:04:12,710 --> 00:04:12,720
can understand whatever it is we're
 

211
00:04:12,720 --> 00:04:14,990
can understand whatever it is we're
trying to to figure out whereas part of

212
00:04:14,990 --> 00:04:15,000
trying to to figure out whereas part of
 

213
00:04:15,000 --> 00:04:17,449
trying to to figure out whereas part of
understanding ourselves is understanding

214
00:04:17,449 --> 00:04:17,459
understanding ourselves is understanding
 

215
00:04:17,459 --> 00:04:18,590
understanding ourselves is understanding
that there are things we can't

216
00:04:18,590 --> 00:04:18,600
that there are things we can't
 

217
00:04:18,600 --> 00:04:22,270
that there are things we can't
understand and I think that's that's

218
00:04:22,270 --> 00:04:22,280
understand and I think that's that's
 

219
00:04:22,280 --> 00:04:24,770
understand and I think that's that's
indispensably important I think to

220
00:04:24,770 --> 00:04:24,780
indispensably important I think to
 

221
00:04:24,780 --> 00:04:27,590
indispensably important I think to
health and happiness and also to having

222
00:04:27,590 --> 00:04:27,600
health and happiness and also to having
 

223
00:04:27,600 --> 00:04:30,530
health and happiness and also to having
enough humility to see how people can be

224
00:04:30,530 --> 00:04:30,540
enough humility to see how people can be
 

225
00:04:30,540 --> 00:04:32,210
enough humility to see how people can be
different from us how we can be

226
00:04:32,210 --> 00:04:32,220
different from us how we can be
 

227
00:04:32,220 --> 00:04:34,550
different from us how we can be
different from ourselves at times so

228
00:04:34,550 --> 00:04:34,560
different from ourselves at times so
 

229
00:04:34,560 --> 00:04:37,969
different from ourselves at times so
knowing that we don't know a lot and

230
00:04:37,969 --> 00:04:37,979
knowing that we don't know a lot and
 

231
00:04:37,979 --> 00:04:40,490
knowing that we don't know a lot and
having some idea of what that might be I

232
00:04:40,490 --> 00:04:40,500
having some idea of what that might be I
 

233
00:04:40,500 --> 00:04:42,770
having some idea of what that might be I
I think is an indispensable part of the

234
00:04:42,770 --> 00:04:42,780
I think is an indispensable part of the
 

235
00:04:42,780 --> 00:04:44,390
I think is an indispensable part of the
process which I think is different from

236
00:04:44,390 --> 00:04:44,400
process which I think is different from
 

237
00:04:44,400 --> 00:04:47,090
process which I think is different from
machines I think yeah the machines

238
00:04:47,090 --> 00:04:47,100
machines I think yeah the machines
 

239
00:04:47,100 --> 00:04:48,650
machines I think yeah the machines
you're basically saying machines

240
00:04:48,650 --> 00:04:48,660
you're basically saying machines
 

241
00:04:48,660 --> 00:04:51,110
you're basically saying machines
generally because they're engineered

242
00:04:51,110 --> 00:04:51,120
generally because they're engineered
 

243
00:04:51,120 --> 00:04:52,909
generally because they're engineered
from a design they're usually going to

244
00:04:52,909 --> 00:04:52,919
from a design they're usually going to
 

245
00:04:52,919 --> 00:04:55,670
from a design they're usually going to
be simpler therefore understandable and

246
00:04:55,670 --> 00:04:55,680
be simpler therefore understandable and
 

247
00:04:55,680 --> 00:04:57,050
be simpler therefore understandable and
you're saying the complexity of the

248
00:04:57,050 --> 00:04:57,060
you're saying the complexity of the
 

249
00:04:57,060 --> 00:04:59,030
you're saying the complexity of the
human mind is uh

250
00:04:59,030 --> 00:04:59,040
human mind is uh
 

251
00:04:59,040 --> 00:05:00,830
human mind is uh
at least from our perspective nearly

252
00:05:00,830 --> 00:05:00,840
at least from our perspective nearly
 

253
00:05:00,840 --> 00:05:01,790
at least from our perspective nearly
infinite

254
00:05:01,790 --> 00:05:01,800
infinite
 

255
00:05:01,800 --> 00:05:03,890
infinite
is there a meta phenomena what sometimes

256
00:05:03,890 --> 00:05:03,900
is there a meta phenomena what sometimes
 

257
00:05:03,900 --> 00:05:05,510
is there a meta phenomena what sometimes
gets described as sort of levels of

258
00:05:05,510 --> 00:05:05,520
gets described as sort of levels of
 

259
00:05:05,520 --> 00:05:08,330
gets described as sort of levels of
emergence where at increasing levels of

260
00:05:08,330 --> 00:05:08,340
emergence where at increasing levels of
 

261
00:05:08,340 --> 00:05:11,270
emergence where at increasing levels of
complexity you have novelty evolved that

262
00:05:11,270 --> 00:05:11,280
complexity you have novelty evolved that
 

263
00:05:11,280 --> 00:05:14,270
complexity you have novelty evolved that
you that you can't predict from from

264
00:05:14,270 --> 00:05:14,280
you that you can't predict from from
 

265
00:05:14,280 --> 00:05:16,490
you that you can't predict from from
lower levels of complexity like for

266
00:05:16,490 --> 00:05:16,500
lower levels of complexity like for
 

267
00:05:16,500 --> 00:05:18,830
lower levels of complexity like for
example atoms to molecules you know it's

268
00:05:18,830 --> 00:05:18,840
example atoms to molecules you know it's
 

269
00:05:18,840 --> 00:05:23,270
example atoms to molecules you know it's
just one example I I think uh neurons to

270
00:05:23,270 --> 00:05:23,280
just one example I I think uh neurons to
 

271
00:05:23,280 --> 00:05:25,550
just one example I I think uh neurons to
Consciousness Consciousness to culture

272
00:05:25,550 --> 00:05:25,560
Consciousness Consciousness to culture
 

273
00:05:25,560 --> 00:05:28,010
Consciousness Consciousness to culture
right that there are meta phenomena that

274
00:05:28,010 --> 00:05:28,020
right that there are meta phenomena that
 

275
00:05:28,020 --> 00:05:30,050
right that there are meta phenomena that
separate from the phenomenon from the

276
00:05:30,050 --> 00:05:30,060
separate from the phenomenon from the
 

277
00:05:30,060 --> 00:05:32,570
separate from the phenomenon from the
phenomena underneath of them and and

278
00:05:32,570 --> 00:05:32,580
phenomena underneath of them and and
 

279
00:05:32,580 --> 00:05:34,969
phenomena underneath of them and and
therefore by adding an entire aspect of

280
00:05:34,969 --> 00:05:34,979
therefore by adding an entire aspect of
 

281
00:05:34,979 --> 00:05:37,909
therefore by adding an entire aspect of
novelty so I I think we are

282
00:05:37,909 --> 00:05:37,919
novelty so I I think we are
 

283
00:05:37,919 --> 00:05:39,770
novelty so I I think we are
I mean I really think this is true that

284
00:05:39,770 --> 00:05:39,780
I mean I really think this is true that
 

285
00:05:39,780 --> 00:05:41,390
I mean I really think this is true that
we are all infinitely fascinating

286
00:05:41,390 --> 00:05:41,400
we are all infinitely fascinating
 

287
00:05:41,400 --> 00:05:43,430
we are all infinitely fascinating
because of these levels of emergence of

288
00:05:43,430 --> 00:05:43,440
because of these levels of emergence of
 

289
00:05:43,440 --> 00:05:45,770
because of these levels of emergence of
novelty that are inscrutable because you

290
00:05:45,770 --> 00:05:45,780
novelty that are inscrutable because you
 

291
00:05:45,780 --> 00:05:47,749
novelty that are inscrutable because you
can't predict from one level to the next

292
00:05:47,749 --> 00:05:47,759
can't predict from one level to the next
 

293
00:05:47,759 --> 00:05:51,409
can't predict from one level to the next
or understand fully are what make us and

294
00:05:51,409 --> 00:05:51,419
or understand fully are what make us and
 

295
00:05:51,419 --> 00:05:52,969
or understand fully are what make us and
not just us but I think sentient

296
00:05:52,969 --> 00:05:52,979
not just us but I think sentient
 

297
00:05:52,979 --> 00:05:55,490
not just us but I think sentient
creatures right human beings right but

298
00:05:55,490 --> 00:05:55,500
creatures right human beings right but
 

299
00:05:55,500 --> 00:05:58,189
creatures right human beings right but
sentient creatures inestimably more

300
00:05:58,189 --> 00:05:58,199
sentient creatures inestimably more
 

301
00:05:58,199 --> 00:06:00,290
sentient creatures inestimably more
interesting than than creatures that

302
00:06:00,290 --> 00:06:00,300
interesting than than creatures that
 

303
00:06:00,300 --> 00:06:01,909
interesting than than creatures that
aren't as sentient and and I don't know

304
00:06:01,909 --> 00:06:01,919
aren't as sentient and and I don't know
 

305
00:06:01,919 --> 00:06:04,129
aren't as sentient and and I don't know
I think when when we think about machine

306
00:06:04,129 --> 00:06:04,139
I think when when we think about machine
 

307
00:06:04,139 --> 00:06:05,990
I think when when we think about machine
learning and artificial intelligence I

308
00:06:05,990 --> 00:06:06,000
learning and artificial intelligence I
 

309
00:06:06,000 --> 00:06:07,969
learning and artificial intelligence I
think it's that that we're trying to

310
00:06:07,969 --> 00:06:07,979
think it's that that we're trying to
 

311
00:06:07,979 --> 00:06:11,090
think it's that that we're trying to
create levels of emergence that now we

312
00:06:11,090 --> 00:06:11,100
create levels of emergence that now we
 

313
00:06:11,100 --> 00:06:13,490
create levels of emergence that now we
don't fully understand anymore which I

314
00:06:13,490 --> 00:06:13,500
don't fully understand anymore which I
 

315
00:06:13,500 --> 00:06:15,050
don't fully understand anymore which I
guess is both exciting and maybe scary

316
00:06:15,050 --> 00:06:15,060
guess is both exciting and maybe scary
 

317
00:06:15,060 --> 00:06:16,610
guess is both exciting and maybe scary
too

318
00:06:16,610 --> 00:06:16,620
too
 

319
00:06:16,620 --> 00:06:19,270
too
yeah so he started the physics of atoms

320
00:06:19,270 --> 00:06:19,280
yeah so he started the physics of atoms
 

321
00:06:19,280 --> 00:06:22,430
yeah so he started the physics of atoms
uh quantum mechanics going to chemistry

322
00:06:22,430 --> 00:06:22,440
uh quantum mechanics going to chemistry
 

323
00:06:22,440 --> 00:06:24,230
uh quantum mechanics going to chemistry
going to biology

324
00:06:24,230 --> 00:06:24,240
going to biology
 

325
00:06:24,240 --> 00:06:27,050
going to biology

that's new that's novel and and I think
that describes to some degree that like

00:10:30,060 --> 00:10:32,449
emergent thing so to speak that that we
build is culture right the aggregation

00:10:39,839 --> 00:10:41,329
which are entirely unique even the fact
that time is different for you and me

that time is different for you and me

00:10:41,339 --> 00:10:43,550
that time is different for you and me
right it may be by Pico seconds right

550
00:10:43,550 --> 00:10:43,560
right it may be by Pico seconds right
 

551
00:10:43,560 --> 00:10:47,889
right it may be by Pico seconds right
but we can engage because our our

552
00:10:47,889 --> 00:10:47,899
but we can engage because our our
 

553
00:10:47,899 --> 00:10:50,210
but we can engage because our our
perceptions of time are parallel enough

554
00:10:50,210 --> 00:10:50,220
perceptions of time are parallel enough
 

555
00:10:50,220 --> 00:10:52,730

they're close enough right that we can

they're close enough right that we can
 

557
00:10:52,740 --> 00:10:54,829
they're close enough right that we can
share a reality right but we're all

share a reality right but we're all
 

559
00:10:54,839 --> 00:10:57,530

living in a different dimension of time
 

561
00:10:57,540 --> 00:10:59,509
living in a different dimension of time
right I mean we know that right so we're

562
00:10:59,509 --> 00:10:59,519
right I mean we know that right so we're
 

563
00:10:59,519 --> 00:11:03,170
right I mean we know that right so we're
unique in that way and then the Unique

564
00:11:03,170 --> 00:11:03,180
unique in that way and then the Unique
 

565
00:11:03,180 --> 00:11:04,730
unique in that way and then the Unique
Individuals that we are just like the

Individuals that we are just like the
 

567
00:11:04,740 --> 00:11:08,329
Individuals that we are just like the
cells right start to create not just one

568
00:11:08,329 --> 00:11:08,339
cells right start to create not just one
 

569
00:11:08,339 --> 00:11:10,610
cells right start to create not just one
thing not just a culture but culture on

00:11:10,610 --> 00:11:10,620
thing not just a culture but culture on
 

571
00:11:10,620 --> 00:11:14,210
thing not just a culture but culture on
top of our individuality right there our

00:11:14,210 --> 00:11:14,220
top of our individuality right there our
 

573
00:11:14,220 --> 00:11:16,370
top of our individuality right there our
uniqueness our even dimensional

574
00:11:16,370 --> 00:11:16,380
uniqueness our even dimensional
 

575
00:11:16,380 --> 00:11:19,190
uniqueness our even dimensional
uniqueness of of time and experience and

00:11:19,190 --> 00:11:19,200
uniqueness of of time and experience and
 

577
00:11:19,200 --> 00:11:21,710
uniqueness of of time and experience and
and Consciousness so we create cultures

578
00:11:21,710 --> 00:11:21,720
and Consciousness so we create cultures
 

579
00:11:21,720 --> 00:11:24,769
and Consciousness so we create cultures
on top of us but what could be Beyond

580
00:11:24,769 --> 00:11:24,779
on top of us but what could be Beyond
 

581
00:11:24,779 --> 00:11:28,370
on top of us but what could be Beyond
culture right and and what is different

582
00:11:28,370 --> 00:11:28,380
culture right and and what is different
 

583
00:11:28,380 --> 00:11:30,769
culture right and and what is different
from us either on underlying levels like

584
00:11:30,769 --> 00:11:30,779
from us either on underlying levels like
 

585
00:11:30,779 --> 00:11:32,030
from us either on underlying levels like
you know like quantum physics or

586
00:11:32,030 --> 00:11:32,040
you know like quantum physics or
 

587
00:11:32,040 --> 00:11:34,670
you know like quantum physics or
chemistry or biology or entirely

chemistry or biology or entirely
 

589
00:11:34,680 --> 00:11:37,009
chemistry or biology or entirely
different and unconceived I think is

590
00:11:37,009 --> 00:11:37,019
different and unconceived I think is
 

591
00:11:37,019 --> 00:11:39,829
different and unconceived I think is
it's an immense question and I think

592
00:11:39,829 --> 00:11:39,839
it's an immense question and I think
 

593
00:11:39,839 --> 00:11:42,170
it's an immense question and I think
it's one that should create humility in

594
00:11:42,170 --> 00:11:42,180
it's one that should create humility in
 

595
00:11:42,180 --> 00:11:43,790
it's one that should create humility in
us right that look look how much we

596
00:11:43,790 --> 00:11:43,800
us right that look look how much we
 

597
00:11:43,800 --> 00:11:46,250
us right that look look how much we
don't know and then how Reckless we are

598
00:11:46,250 --> 00:11:46,260
don't know and then how Reckless we are
 

599
00:11:46,260 --> 00:11:48,949
don't know and then how Reckless we are
with ourselves with our Resources with

00:11:48,949 --> 00:11:48,959
with ourselves with our Resources with
 

601
00:11:48,959 --> 00:11:51,769
with ourselves with our Resources with
with human life and and I think there

602
00:11:51,769 --> 00:11:51,779
with human life and and I think there
 

603
00:11:51,779 --> 00:11:54,110
with human life and and I think there
it's I I it's important to say I mean

604
00:11:54,110 --> 00:11:54,120
it's I I it's important to say I mean
 

605
00:11:54,120 --> 00:11:56,630
it's I I it's important to say I mean
you think about how entropy rules

606
00:11:56,630 --> 00:11:56,640
you think about how entropy rules
 

607
00:11:56,640 --> 00:11:59,110
you think about how entropy rules
the universe around us I mean how over

608
00:11:59,110 --> 00:11:59,120
the universe around us I mean how over
 

609
00:11:59,120 --> 00:12:02,710
the universe around us I mean how over
selected are we how many not just

610
00:12:02,710 --> 00:12:02,720
selected are we how many not just
 

611
00:12:02,720 --> 00:12:05,870
selected are we how many not just
hundreds or thousands of times but how

612
00:12:05,870 --> 00:12:05,880
hundreds or thousands of times but how
 

613
00:12:05,880 --> 00:12:08,030
hundreds or thousands of times but how
many millions of times does there have

614
00:12:08,030 --> 00:12:08,040
many millions of times does there have
 

615
00:12:08,040 --> 00:12:10,670
many millions of times does there have
to be a selection Branch point before we

616
00:12:10,670 --> 00:12:10,680
to be a selection Branch point before we
 

617
00:12:10,680 --> 00:12:12,889
to be a selection Branch point before we
get into a sort of Eddie pool of counter

618
00:12:12,889 --> 00:12:12,899
get into a sort of Eddie pool of counter
 

619
00:12:12,899 --> 00:12:15,710
get into a sort of Eddie pool of counter
entropy right where you can begin to

okay the the atoms know about love right

the the the fact that anything is being
 

629
00:12:23,220 --> 00:12:25,190
the the the fact that anything is being
created right means there's this over

we don't often think about that of of

we don't often think about that of of

00:12:49,079 --> 00:12:51,170
where this could happen and we don't
think about what does that

648
00:12:51,170 --> 00:12:51,180
think about what does that
 

649
00:12:51,180 --> 00:12:53,569
think about what does that
mean everything that you said love

650
00:12:53,569 --> 00:12:53,579
mean everything that you said love
 

651
00:12:53,579 --> 00:12:57,410
mean everything that you said love
everything is uh uh counter entropy goes

652
00:12:57,410 --> 00:12:57,420
everything is uh uh counter entropy goes
 

653
00:12:57,420 --> 00:12:58,790
everything is uh uh counter entropy goes
against the way

654
00:12:58,790 --> 00:12:58,800
against the way
 

655
00:12:58,800 --> 00:13:00,710
against the way
uh the basic physics of the universe so

656
00:13:00,710 --> 00:13:00,720
uh the basic physics of the universe so
 

657
00:13:00,720 --> 00:13:02,150
uh the basic physics of the universe so
maybe actually the atoms really don't

658
00:13:02,150 --> 00:13:02,160
maybe actually the atoms really don't
 

659
00:13:02,160 --> 00:13:04,970
maybe actually the atoms really don't
like what we're doing they want us to

660
00:13:04,970 --> 00:13:04,980
like what we're doing they want us to
 

661
00:13:04,980 --> 00:13:06,590
like what we're doing they want us to
stop they've been trying really hard to

662
00:13:06,590 --> 00:13:06,600
stop they've been trying really hard to
 

663
00:13:06,600 --> 00:13:09,650
stop they've been trying really hard to
stop and despite that we somehow uh

664
00:13:09,650 --> 00:13:09,660
stop and despite that we somehow uh
 

665
00:13:09,660 --> 00:13:11,210
stop and despite that we somehow uh
started this whole bacteria thing for

666
00:13:11,210 --> 00:13:11,220
started this whole bacteria thing for
 

667
00:13:11,220 --> 00:13:12,710
started this whole bacteria thing for
for like a billion years and now we're

668
00:13:12,710 --> 00:13:12,720
for like a billion years and now we're
 

669
00:13:12,720 --> 00:13:14,990
for like a billion years and now we're
hearing it I give it kind of the other

670
00:13:14,990 --> 00:13:15,000
hearing it I give it kind of the other
 

671
00:13:15,000 --> 00:13:17,449
hearing it I give it kind of the other
way I don't think there's any purpose to

672
00:13:17,449 --> 00:13:17,459
way I don't think there's any purpose to
 

673
00:13:17,459 --> 00:13:20,750
way I don't think there's any purpose to
purposelessness right so so why would

674
00:13:20,750 --> 00:13:20,760
purposelessness right so so why would
 

675
00:13:20,760 --> 00:13:23,449
purposelessness right so so why would
anything be here if we if the drive

00:13:26,600 --> 00:13:29,090

place of counter entropy which then
 

723
00:14:19,200 --> 00:14:21,829
place of counter entropy which then
could provide even thoughts about like

00:14:21,829 --> 00:14:21,839
could provide even thoughts about like
 

725
00:14:21,839 --> 00:14:23,329
could provide even thoughts about like
good and evil right the idea that

726
00:14:23,329 --> 00:14:23,339
good and evil right the idea that
 

727
00:14:23,339 --> 00:14:26,690
good and evil right the idea that
creating that preserving is good right

creating that preserving is good right
 

729
00:14:26,700 --> 00:14:28,310
creating that preserving is good right
it's what we build upon it's how we get

730
00:14:28,310 --> 00:14:28,320
it's what we build upon it's how we get
 

731
00:14:28,320 --> 00:14:30,050
it's what we build upon it's how we get

to the Eddie pool of counter entropy
 

733
00:14:30,060 --> 00:14:33,290
to the Eddie pool of counter entropy
right so then destruction is not good

734
00:14:33,290 --> 00:14:33,300
right so then destruction is not good
 

735
00:14:33,300 --> 00:14:35,090
right so then destruction is not good
you know what what good comes of

736
00:14:35,090 --> 00:14:35,100
you know what what good comes of
 

737
00:14:35,100 --> 00:14:38,090
you know what what good comes of
aggression and destruction right you

738
00:14:38,090 --> 00:14:38,100
aggression and destruction right you
 

739
00:14:38,100 --> 00:14:39,769
aggression and destruction right you
know unless we're protecting we can

740
00:14:39,769 --> 00:14:39,779
know unless we're protecting we can
 

741
00:14:39,779 --> 00:14:41,990
know unless we're protecting we can
think of of outlying cases but just

742
00:14:41,990 --> 00:14:42,000
think of of outlying cases but just
 

743
00:14:42,000 --> 00:14:43,610
think of of outlying cases but just
think in general concepts right the

744
00:14:43,610 --> 00:14:43,620
think in general concepts right the
 

745
00:14:43,620 --> 00:14:46,310
think in general concepts right the
destruction destroys it brings us

746
00:14:46,310 --> 00:14:46,320
destruction destroys it brings us
 

747
00:14:46,320 --> 00:14:48,290
destruction destroys it brings us
towards a state of entropy towards a

753
00:14:52,740 --> 00:14:55,030
commonality
um collaboration right

754
00:14:55,030 --> 00:14:55,040
um collaboration right
 

755
00:14:55,040 --> 00:14:57,590
um collaboration right
nurturing right brings

756
00:14:57,590 --> 00:14:57,600
nurturing right brings
 

757
00:14:57,600 --> 00:15:00,710
nurturing right brings
novelty it brings new existence into the

758
00:15:00,710 --> 00:15:00,720
novelty it brings new existence into the
 

759
00:15:00,720 --> 00:15:02,389
novelty it brings new existence into the
universe and I think we don't we don't

760
00:15:02,389 --> 00:15:02,399
universe and I think we don't we don't
 

761
00:15:02,399 --> 00:15:04,250
universe and I think we don't we don't
think about that we're in the middle of

762
00:15:04,250 --> 00:15:04,260
think about that we're in the middle of
 

763
00:15:04,260 --> 00:15:06,590
think about that we're in the middle of
something so vast and built on top of so

764
00:15:06,590 --> 00:15:06,600
something so vast and built on top of so
 

765
00:15:06,600 --> 00:15:08,389
something so vast and built on top of so
many layers and I think it leads us to

766
00:15:08,389 --> 00:15:08,399
many layers and I think it leads us to
 

767
00:15:08,399 --> 00:15:11,569
many layers and I think it leads us to
be Cavalier you know with with human

768
00:15:11,569 --> 00:15:11,579
be Cavalier you know with with human
 

769
00:15:11,579 --> 00:15:13,850
be Cavalier you know with with human
life including often our own

770
00:15:13,850 --> 00:15:13,860
life including often our own
 

771
00:15:13,860 --> 00:15:16,189
life including often our own
so you think this there's a underlying

772
00:15:16,189 --> 00:15:16,199
so you think this there's a underlying
 

773
00:15:16,199 --> 00:15:19,310
so you think this there's a underlying
creative force of the universe that uh

774
00:15:19,310 --> 00:15:19,320
creative force of the universe that uh
 

775
00:15:19,320 --> 00:15:21,829
creative force of the universe that uh
that might even have a kind of

776
00:15:21,829 --> 00:15:21,839
that might even have a kind of
 

777
00:15:21,839 --> 00:15:25,250
that might even have a kind of
built-in morality to it where

778
00:15:25,250 --> 00:15:25,260
built-in morality to it where
 

779
00:15:25,260 --> 00:15:27,650
built-in morality to it where
creating is better than destroying

780
00:15:27,650 --> 00:15:27,660
creating is better than destroying
 

781
00:15:27,660 --> 00:15:29,870
creating is better than destroying
and then that somehow maps on onto our

782
00:15:29,870 --> 00:15:29,880
and then that somehow maps on onto our
 

783
00:15:29,880 --> 00:15:32,269
and then that somehow maps on onto our
society where we kind of try to figure

784
00:15:32,269 --> 00:15:32,279
society where we kind of try to figure
 

785
00:15:32,279 --> 00:15:34,610
society where we kind of try to figure
out what that actually means in terms of

786
00:15:34,610 --> 00:15:34,620
out what that actually means in terms of
 

787
00:15:34,620 --> 00:15:36,949
out what that actually means in terms of
Good and Evil so there that's some

788
00:15:36,949 --> 00:15:36,959
Good and Evil so there that's some
 

789
00:15:36,959 --> 00:15:39,290
Good and Evil so there that's some
something is there like that but it's

790
00:15:39,290 --> 00:15:39,300
something is there like that but it's
 

791
00:15:39,300 --> 00:15:41,810
something is there like that but it's
like but it has to be

792
00:15:41,810 --> 00:15:41,820
like but it has to be
 

793
00:15:41,820 --> 00:15:43,550
like but it has to be
it's like so nice it's so perfect

794
00:15:43,550 --> 00:15:43,560
it's like so nice it's so perfect
 

795
00:15:43,560 --> 00:15:45,050
it's like so nice it's so perfect
because it's rare

796
00:15:45,050 --> 00:15:45,060
because it's rare
 

797
00:15:45,060 --> 00:15:47,030
because it's rare
is sufficiently rare where we have our

798
00:15:47,030 --> 00:15:47,040
is sufficiently rare where we have our
 

799
00:15:47,040 --> 00:15:48,650
is sufficiently rare where we have our
own space like you can like close the

800
00:15:48,650 --> 00:15:48,660
own space like you can like close the
 

801
00:15:48,660 --> 00:15:49,970
own space like you can like close the
door and it's like I need to be alone

802
00:15:49,970 --> 00:15:49,980
door and it's like I need to be alone
 

803
00:15:49,980 --> 00:15:52,670
door and it's like I need to be alone
right now as our human civilization to

804
00:15:52,670 --> 00:15:52,680
right now as our human civilization to
 

805
00:15:52,680 --> 00:15:54,350
right now as our human civilization to
work on my thing so it's sufficiently

806
00:15:54,350 --> 00:15:54,360
work on my thing so it's sufficiently
 

807
00:15:54,360 --> 00:15:55,670
work on my thing so it's sufficiently
rare that there's not other alien

808
00:15:55,670 --> 00:15:55,680
rare that there's not other alien
 

809
00:15:55,680 --> 00:15:56,810
rare that there's not other alien
civilizations they're just like

810
00:15:56,810 --> 00:15:56,820
civilizations they're just like
 

811
00:15:56,820 --> 00:15:58,069
civilizations they're just like
constantly knocking on our door

812
00:15:58,069 --> 00:15:58,079
constantly knocking on our door
 

813
00:15:58,079 --> 00:15:59,990
constantly knocking on our door
destroying us

814
00:15:59,990 --> 00:16:00,000
destroying us
 

815
00:16:00,000 --> 00:16:01,850
destroying us
um but it still exists that's weird

816
00:16:01,850 --> 00:16:01,860
um but it still exists that's weird
 

817
00:16:01,860 --> 00:16:04,850
um but it still exists that's weird
right right it's so fantastically

818
00:16:04,850 --> 00:16:04,860
right right it's so fantastically
 

819
00:16:04,860 --> 00:16:07,250
right right it's so fantastically
improbable yeah that I think we should

820
00:16:07,250 --> 00:16:07,260
improbable yeah that I think we should
 

821
00:16:07,260 --> 00:16:10,129
improbable yeah that I think we should
be very respectful of it and I think you

822
00:16:10,129 --> 00:16:10,139
be very respectful of it and I think you
 

823
00:16:10,139 --> 00:16:11,689
be very respectful of it and I think you
said there's a creative force that

824
00:16:11,689 --> 00:16:11,699
said there's a creative force that
 

825
00:16:11,699 --> 00:16:14,030
said there's a creative force that
values creativity yes things to be well

826
00:16:14,030 --> 00:16:14,040
values creativity yes things to be well
 

827
00:16:14,040 --> 00:16:16,670
values creativity yes things to be well
sure if it's a creative Force right it's

828
00:16:16,670 --> 00:16:16,680
sure if it's a creative Force right it's
 

829
00:16:16,680 --> 00:16:19,370
sure if it's a creative Force right it's
existence its ability to exist and to

830
00:16:19,370 --> 00:16:19,380
existence its ability to exist and to
 

831
00:16:19,380 --> 00:16:20,629
existence its ability to exist and to
create

832
00:16:20,629 --> 00:16:20,639
create
 

833
00:16:20,639 --> 00:16:23,150
create
comes from something other than entropy

834
00:16:23,150 --> 00:16:23,160
comes from something other than entropy
 

835
00:16:23,160 --> 00:16:24,590
comes from something other than entropy
right something other than so much

836
00:16:24,590 --> 00:16:24,600
right something other than so much
 

837
00:16:24,600 --> 00:16:25,910
right something other than so much
dispersion that there's nothingness

838
00:16:25,910 --> 00:16:25,920
dispersion that there's nothingness
 

839
00:16:25,920 --> 00:16:28,430
dispersion that there's nothingness
right so so the creative force will

840
00:16:28,430 --> 00:16:28,440
right so so the creative force will
 

841
00:16:28,440 --> 00:16:30,170
right so so the creative force will
value

842
00:16:30,170 --> 00:16:30,180
value
 

843
00:16:30,180 --> 00:16:32,090
value
the sanctity of things right you know

844
00:16:32,090 --> 00:16:32,100
the sanctity of things right you know
 

845
00:16:32,100 --> 00:16:34,069
the sanctity of things right you know
keeping things together not destroying

846
00:16:34,069 --> 00:16:34,079
keeping things together not destroying
 

847
00:16:34,079 --> 00:16:36,829
keeping things together not destroying
things right building novelty including

848
00:16:36,829 --> 00:16:36,839
things right building novelty including
 

849
00:16:36,839 --> 00:16:38,509
things right building novelty including
novelty of knowledge novelty of

novelty of knowledge novelty of
 

851
00:16:38,519 --> 00:16:41,930
novelty of knowledge novelty of
sentience I mean it fits with the idea

852
00:16:41,930 --> 00:16:41,940
sentience I mean it fits with the idea
 

853
00:16:41,940 --> 00:16:43,430
sentience I mean it fits with the idea
that we're not nothing that that's

854
00:16:43,430 --> 00:16:43,440
that we're not nothing that that's
 

855
00:16:43,440 --> 00:16:46,310
that we're not nothing that that's
incredibly improbable and that there are

856
00:16:46,310 --> 00:16:46,320
incredibly improbable and that there are
 

857
00:16:46,320 --> 00:16:48,470
incredibly improbable and that there are
these many many layers of emergence that

858
00:16:48,470 --> 00:16:48,480
these many many layers of emergence that
 

859
00:16:48,480 --> 00:16:51,410
these many many layers of emergence that
we're standing upon and I think it tells

860
00:16:51,410 --> 00:16:51,420
we're standing upon and I think it tells
 

861
00:16:51,420 --> 00:16:53,930
we're standing upon and I think it tells
us something that we're not doing

862
00:16:53,930 --> 00:16:53,940
us something that we're not doing
 

863
00:16:53,940 --> 00:16:56,569
us something that we're not doing
ourselves a service to ignore right it's

00:16:56,569 --> 00:16:56,579
ourselves a service to ignore right it's
 

865
00:16:56,579 --> 00:16:58,910
ourselves a service to ignore right it's
not just a jump to saying oh there's a

00:16:58,910 --> 00:16:58,920
not just a jump to saying oh there's a

00:17:00,230 --> 00:17:00,240
religious answer to everything he says
 

869
00:17:00,240 --> 00:17:01,910
religious answer to everything he says
no it's saying

870
00:17:01,910 --> 00:17:01,920
no it's saying
 

871
00:17:01,920 --> 00:17:04,069
no it's saying
science isn't a God either right so if

872
00:17:04,069 --> 00:17:04,079
science isn't a God either right so if
 

873
00:17:04,079 --> 00:17:06,289
science isn't a God either right so if
we if we if we think of science as a

like I remember showing up at medical

880
00:17:12,949 --> 00:17:12,959
like I remember showing up at medical
 

881
00:17:12,959 --> 00:17:14,630
like I remember showing up at medical
school and it really is true I mean I

882
00:17:14,630 --> 00:17:14,640
school and it really is true I mean I
 

883
00:17:14,640 --> 00:17:17,630
school and it really is true I mean I
knew so little about the human body I'd

884
00:17:17,630 --> 00:17:17,640
knew so little about the human body I'd
 

885
00:17:17,640 --> 00:17:19,250
knew so little about the human body I'd
only been in hospitals to visit people

886
00:17:19,250 --> 00:17:19,260
only been in hospitals to visit people
 

887
00:17:19,260 --> 00:17:21,230
only been in hospitals to visit people
I've taken pre-med classes but sort of

888
00:17:21,230 --> 00:17:21,240
I've taken pre-med classes but sort of
 

889
00:17:21,240 --> 00:17:23,390
I've taken pre-med classes but sort of
intensely at once after I didn't take

890
00:17:23,390 --> 00:17:23,400
intensely at once after I didn't take
 

891
00:17:23,400 --> 00:17:25,250
intensely at once after I didn't take
any and I was working in business I I

892
00:17:25,250 --> 00:17:25,260
any and I was working in business I I
 

893
00:17:25,260 --> 00:17:27,289
any and I was working in business I I
knew next to nothing and and I had this

894
00:17:27,289 --> 00:17:27,299
knew next to nothing and and I had this
 

895
00:17:27,299 --> 00:17:29,930
knew next to nothing and and I had this
idea that was so naive in retrospect

896
00:17:29,930 --> 00:17:29,940
idea that was so naive in retrospect
 

897
00:17:29,940 --> 00:17:31,850
idea that was so naive in retrospect
that I was going to learn so much right

898
00:17:31,850 --> 00:17:31,860
that I was going to learn so much right
 

899
00:17:31,860 --> 00:17:32,990
that I was going to learn so much right
I was going to answer these questions

900
00:17:32,990 --> 00:17:33,000
I was going to answer these questions
 

901
00:17:33,000 --> 00:17:34,250
I was going to answer these questions
because I was going what's going on in

902
00:17:34,250 --> 00:17:34,260
because I was going what's going on in
 

903
00:17:34,260 --> 00:17:35,450
because I was going what's going on in
the body what are these organs doing

904
00:17:35,450 --> 00:17:35,460
the body what are these organs doing
 

905
00:17:35,460 --> 00:17:37,610
the body what are these organs doing
what are these cells and what I learned

906
00:17:37,610 --> 00:17:37,620
what are these cells and what I learned
 

907
00:17:37,620 --> 00:17:39,529
what are these cells and what I learned
was

908
00:17:39,529 --> 00:17:39,539
was
 

909
00:17:39,539 --> 00:17:42,950
was
there was so much more that was amazing

910
00:17:42,950 --> 00:17:42,960
there was so much more that was amazing
 

911
00:17:42,960 --> 00:17:45,590
there was so much more that was amazing
and mysterious and seemingly impossible

912
00:17:45,590 --> 00:17:45,600
and mysterious and seemingly impossible
 

913
00:17:45,600 --> 00:17:47,990
and mysterious and seemingly impossible
like even how a cell functions right

914
00:17:47,990 --> 00:17:48,000
like even how a cell functions right
 

915
00:17:48,000 --> 00:17:49,909
like even how a cell functions right
like what is going on inside of a cell

916
00:17:49,909 --> 00:17:49,919
like what is going on inside of a cell
 

917
00:17:49,919 --> 00:17:52,010
like what is going on inside of a cell
the transport mechanisms and energy

918
00:17:52,010 --> 00:17:52,020
the transport mechanisms and energy
 

919
00:17:52,020 --> 00:17:54,230
the transport mechanisms and energy
functions and diffusion functions and

920
00:17:54,230 --> 00:17:54,240
functions and diffusion functions and
 

921
00:17:54,240 --> 00:17:56,750
functions and diffusion functions and
then you can go down to smaller levels

922
00:17:56,750 --> 00:17:56,760
then you can go down to smaller levels
 

923
00:17:56,760 --> 00:17:58,610
then you can go down to smaller levels
than that but when you come back out and

924
00:17:58,610 --> 00:17:58,620
than that but when you come back out and
 

925
00:17:58,620 --> 00:18:00,289
than that but when you come back out and
you say how all those cells make a

926
00:18:00,289 --> 00:18:00,299
you say how all those cells make a
 

927
00:18:00,299 --> 00:18:02,590
you say how all those cells make a
kidney it's not

928
00:18:02,590 --> 00:18:02,600
kidney it's not
 

929
00:18:02,600 --> 00:18:04,909
kidney it's not
explanatory you know I remember asking

930
00:18:04,909 --> 00:18:04,919
explanatory you know I remember asking
 

931
00:18:04,919 --> 00:18:07,070

the OB who had delivered my first child

932
00:18:07,070 --> 00:18:07,080
the OB who had delivered my first child
 

933
00:18:07,080 --> 00:18:09,590
the OB who had delivered my first child
right I was so amazed and I asked him

934
00:18:09,590 --> 00:18:09,600
right I was so amazed and I asked him
 

935
00:18:09,600 --> 00:18:11,930
right I was so amazed and I asked him
like what do you think like what do you

936
00:18:11,930 --> 00:18:11,940
like what do you think like what do you
 

937
00:18:11,940 --> 00:18:14,330
like what do you think like what do you
know you do this right you you're seeing

00:18:14,330 --> 00:18:14,340
know you do this right you you're seeing
 

939
00:18:14,340 --> 00:18:16,370
know you do this right you you're seeing
this life created and you know and his

this life created and you know and his
 

941
00:18:16,380 --> 00:18:18,830

thought was nothing where I just marvel

just marvel at it and I think the more
 

947
00:18:23,100 --> 00:18:24,770
just marvel at it and I think the more
we know

we know
 

949
00:18:24,780 --> 00:18:28,850
we know
about us the more we respectfully Marvel

about us the more we respectfully Marvel
 

951
00:18:28,860 --> 00:18:30,470
about us the more we respectfully Marvel
and we should do that we should

we'd be a lot less likely to say hey I

there's so much of this and I understand

974
00:18:55,250 --> 00:18:55,260
there's so much of this and I understand
 

975
00:18:55,260 --> 00:18:57,830
there's so much of this and I understand
it's driven by scarcity and by human

976
00:18:57,830 --> 00:18:57,840
it's driven by scarcity and by human
 

977
00:18:57,840 --> 00:19:00,110
it's driven by scarcity and by human
insecurity and envy and all of these

insecurity and envy and all of these
 

979
00:19:00,120 --> 00:19:01,430
insecurity and envy and all of these
things that I think could drive us

980
00:19:01,430 --> 00:19:01,440
things that I think could drive us
 

981
00:19:01,440 --> 00:19:04,190
things that I think could drive us
towards destruction but all of that

982
00:19:04,190 --> 00:19:04,200
towards destruction but all of that
 

983
00:19:04,200 --> 00:19:06,890
towards destruction but all of that
recklessness comes from

984
00:19:06,890 --> 00:19:06,900
recklessness comes from
 

985
00:19:06,900 --> 00:19:10,010
recklessness comes from
not having this initial appreciation and

that
 

995
00:19:16,799 --> 00:19:20,090
that
but if we Marvel at this whole thing

996
00:19:20,090 --> 00:19:20,100
but if we Marvel at this whole thing
 

997
00:19:20,100 --> 00:19:21,830

beings that are possible
 

1003
00:19:25,320 --> 00:19:28,010
beings that are possible
what do you then make of that some

1004
00:19:28,010 --> 00:19:28,020
what do you then make of that some
 

1005
00:19:28,020 --> 00:19:31,370
what do you then make of that some
humans do evil onto the world

1006
00:19:31,370 --> 00:19:31,380
humans do evil onto the world
 

1007

first of all are all human beings
 

1009
00:19:33,299 --> 00:19:35,630
first of all are all human beings
capable of evil if we're in the process

1010
00:19:35,630 --> 00:19:35,640
capable of evil if we're in the process
 

1011
00:19:35,640 --> 00:19:37,549
capable of evil if we're in the process
now we've got a little bit of momentum

1012
00:19:37,549 --> 00:19:37,559
now we've got a little bit of momentum
 

1013
00:19:37,559 --> 00:19:39,710
now we've got a little bit of momentum
in terms of marveling yeah the layers of

1014
00:19:39,710 --> 00:19:39,720
in terms of marveling yeah the layers of
 

1015
00:19:39,720 --> 00:19:42,289
in terms of marveling yeah the layers of
the cake uh should we also Marvel at the

1016
00:19:42,289 --> 00:19:42,299
the cake uh should we also Marvel at the
 

1017
00:19:42,299 --> 00:19:44,510
the cake uh should we also Marvel at the
capacity for evil in all of us yeah is

1018
00:19:44,510 --> 00:19:44,520
capacity for evil in all of us yeah is
 

1019
00:19:44,520 --> 00:19:46,310
capacity for evil in all of us yeah is
that capacity there I believe that it is

1020
00:19:46,310 --> 00:19:46,320
that capacity there I believe that it is
 

1021
00:19:46,320 --> 00:19:48,710
that capacity there I believe that it is
yes so what do we understand about the

1022
00:19:48,710 --> 00:19:48,720
yes so what do we understand about the
 

1023
00:19:48,720 --> 00:19:50,630
yes so what do we understand about the
psychology of evil where does that

1024
00:19:50,630 --> 00:19:50,640
psychology of evil where does that
 

1025
00:19:50,640 --> 00:19:52,789
psychology of evil where does that
originate in the human mind is it there

1026
00:19:52,789 --> 00:19:52,799
originate in the human mind is it there
 

1027
00:19:52,799 --> 00:19:55,130
originate in the human mind is it there
in the new biology is it there in the

1028
00:19:55,130 --> 00:19:55,140
in the new biology is it there in the
 

1029
00:19:55,140 --> 00:19:57,289
in the new biology is it there in the
environment in the upbringing can I

1030
00:19:57,289 --> 00:19:57,299
environment in the upbringing can I
 

1031
00:19:57,299 --> 00:19:59,090
environment in the upbringing can I
clarify first I think the capacity for

1032
00:19:59,090 --> 00:19:59,100
clarify first I think the capacity for
 

1033
00:19:59,100 --> 00:20:00,770
clarify first I think the capacity for
evil I do believe is in all of us

1034
00:20:00,770 --> 00:20:00,780
evil I do believe is in all of us
 

1035
00:20:00,780 --> 00:20:03,650
evil I do believe is in all of us
there's a difference between enacting

1036
00:20:03,650 --> 00:20:03,660
there's a difference between enacting
 

1037
00:20:03,660 --> 00:20:08,570
there's a difference between enacting
evil and and a sort of preset followed

1038
00:20:08,570 --> 00:20:08,580
evil and and a sort of preset followed
 

1039
00:20:08,580 --> 00:20:11,029
evil and and a sort of preset followed
developed plan of evil right I don't

1040
00:20:11,029 --> 00:20:11,039
developed plan of evil right I don't
 

1041
00:20:11,039 --> 00:20:12,830
developed plan of evil right I don't
believe that all of us are capable of

1042
00:20:12,830 --> 00:20:12,840
believe that all of us are capable of
 

1043
00:20:12,840 --> 00:20:13,810
believe that all of us are capable of
doing

1044
00:20:13,810 --> 00:20:13,820
doing
 

1045
00:20:13,820 --> 00:20:16,610
doing
what the people who perpetrate the most

1046
00:20:16,610 --> 00:20:16,620
what the people who perpetrate the most
 

1047
00:20:16,620 --> 00:20:19,010
what the people who perpetrate the most
evil do right but I do believe that

1048
00:20:19,010 --> 00:20:19,020
evil do right but I do believe that
 

1049
00:20:19,020 --> 00:20:22,490
evil do right but I do believe that
we're capable of of perpetrating evil

1050
00:20:22,490 --> 00:20:22,500
we're capable of of perpetrating evil
 

1051
00:20:22,500 --> 00:20:24,830
we're capable of of perpetrating evil
right and the the thought one thought

1052
00:20:24,830 --> 00:20:24,840
right and the the thought one thought
 

1053
00:20:24,840 --> 00:20:27,890
right and the the thought one thought
would be that there are drives in US I

1054
00:20:27,890 --> 00:20:27,900
would be that there are drives in US I
 

1055
00:20:27,900 --> 00:20:29,510
would be that there are drives in US I
mean there certainly seem to be drives

1056
00:20:29,510 --> 00:20:29,520
mean there certainly seem to be drives
 

1057
00:20:29,520 --> 00:20:32,810
mean there certainly seem to be drives
in US towards survival towards

1058
00:20:32,810 --> 00:20:32,820
in US towards survival towards
 

1059
00:20:32,820 --> 00:20:35,930
in US towards survival towards
gratification uh in some ways towards

1060
00:20:35,930 --> 00:20:35,940
gratification uh in some ways towards
 

1061
00:20:35,940 --> 00:20:37,669
gratification uh in some ways towards
pleasure and that can get very

1062
00:20:37,669 --> 00:20:37,679
pleasure and that can get very
 

1063
00:20:37,679 --> 00:20:39,950
pleasure and that can get very
complicated because pleasure inside can

1064
00:20:39,950 --> 00:20:39,960
complicated because pleasure inside can
 

1065
00:20:39,960 --> 00:20:43,010
complicated because pleasure inside can
be relief of distress so if I feel very

1066
00:20:43,010 --> 00:20:43,020
be relief of distress so if I feel very
 

1067
00:20:43,020 --> 00:20:45,650
be relief of distress so if I feel very
badly about myself and I can feel a

1068
00:20:45,650 --> 00:20:45,660
badly about myself and I can feel a
 

1069
00:20:45,660 --> 00:20:47,510
badly about myself and I can feel a
little better about myself by making you

1070
00:20:47,510 --> 00:20:47,520
little better about myself by making you
 

1071
00:20:47,520 --> 00:20:49,370
little better about myself by making you
feel worse about yourself right which

1072
00:20:49,370 --> 00:20:49,380
feel worse about yourself right which
 

1073
00:20:49,380 --> 00:20:51,350
feel worse about yourself right which
that plays out in a lot of human beings

1074
00:20:51,350 --> 00:20:51,360
that plays out in a lot of human beings
 

1075
00:20:51,360 --> 00:20:53,750
that plays out in a lot of human beings
is is that an indirect way of bringing

1076
00:20:53,750 --> 00:20:53,760
is is that an indirect way of bringing
 

1077
00:20:53,760 --> 00:20:55,669
is is that an indirect way of bringing
pleasure right so it gets very

1078
00:20:55,669 --> 00:20:55,679
pleasure right so it gets very
 

1079
00:20:55,679 --> 00:20:57,710
pleasure right so it gets very
complicated what's going on inside of us

1080
00:20:57,710 --> 00:20:57,720
complicated what's going on inside of us
 

1081
00:20:57,720 --> 00:21:00,710
complicated what's going on inside of us
and sometimes the perpetration of evil

1082
00:21:00,710 --> 00:21:00,720
and sometimes the perpetration of evil
 

1083
00:21:00,720 --> 00:21:02,810
and sometimes the perpetration of evil
things can be through misunderstandings

1084
00:21:02,810 --> 00:21:02,820
things can be through misunderstandings
 

1085
00:21:02,820 --> 00:21:04,789
things can be through misunderstandings
anger impulsivity I mean the things that

1086
00:21:04,789 --> 00:21:04,799
anger impulsivity I mean the things that
 

1087
00:21:04,799 --> 00:21:08,210
anger impulsivity I mean the things that
we can that we can have in Us and other

1088
00:21:08,210 --> 00:21:08,220
we can that we can have in Us and other
 

1089
00:21:08,220 --> 00:21:09,950
we can that we can have in Us and other
times there can be there can be other

1090
00:21:09,950 --> 00:21:09,960
times there can be there can be other
 

1091
00:21:09,960 --> 00:21:12,169
times there can be there can be other
things going on which are through the

1092
00:21:12,169 --> 00:21:12,179
things going on which are through the
 

1093
00:21:12,179 --> 00:21:14,750
things going on which are through the
lens of unhealthy human psychology so

1094
00:21:14,750 --> 00:21:14,760
lens of unhealthy human psychology so
 

1095
00:21:14,760 --> 00:21:17,210
lens of unhealthy human psychology so
for example the psychology of Envy which

1096
00:21:17,210 --> 00:21:17,220
for example the psychology of Envy which
 

1097
00:21:17,220 --> 00:21:20,510
for example the psychology of Envy which
I think drives the Lion's Share of the

1098
00:21:20,510 --> 00:21:20,520
I think drives the Lion's Share of the
 

1099
00:21:20,520 --> 00:21:22,310
I think drives the Lion's Share of the
orchestrated evil right there's a

1100
00:21:22,310 --> 00:21:22,320
orchestrated evil right there's a
 

1101
00:21:22,320 --> 00:21:26,270
orchestrated evil right there's a
difference between impulsive reflexive

1102
00:21:26,270 --> 00:21:26,280
difference between impulsive reflexive
 

1103
00:21:26,280 --> 00:21:29,930
difference between impulsive reflexive
evil and highly orchestrated evil which

1104
00:21:29,930 --> 00:21:29,940
evil and highly orchestrated evil which
 

1105
00:21:29,940 --> 00:21:32,270
evil and highly orchestrated evil which
I think is driven by

1106
00:21:32,270 --> 00:21:32,280
I think is driven by
 

1107
00:21:32,280 --> 00:21:35,810
I think is driven by
Envy highly orchestrated evil are we

1108
00:21:35,810 --> 00:21:35,820
Envy highly orchestrated evil are we
 

1109
00:21:35,820 --> 00:21:37,510
Envy highly orchestrated evil are we
talking about a skilled societies like

1110
00:21:37,510 --> 00:21:37,520
talking about a skilled societies like
 

1111
00:21:37,520 --> 00:21:40,789
talking about a skilled societies like
totalitarianism so if we're thinking

1112
00:21:40,789 --> 00:21:40,799
totalitarianism so if we're thinking
 

1113
00:21:40,799 --> 00:21:44,090
totalitarianism so if we're thinking
about about somebody like Hitler so as

1114
00:21:44,090 --> 00:21:44,100
about about somebody like Hitler so as
 

1115
00:21:44,100 --> 00:21:45,529
about about somebody like Hitler so as
at scale

1116
00:21:45,529 --> 00:21:45,539
at scale
 

1117
00:21:45,539 --> 00:21:48,230
at scale
orchestration of evil Envy driving that

1118
00:21:48,230 --> 00:21:48,240
orchestration of evil Envy driving that
 

1119
00:21:48,240 --> 00:21:50,390
orchestration of evil Envy driving that
so I mean that's really interesting to

1120
00:21:50,390 --> 00:21:50,400
so I mean that's really interesting to
 

1121
00:21:50,400 --> 00:21:52,250
so I mean that's really interesting to
to think about I'd love to hear more

1122
00:21:52,250 --> 00:21:52,260
to think about I'd love to hear more
 

1123
00:21:52,260 --> 00:21:53,930
to think about I'd love to hear more
about it so some of it there might be

1124
00:21:53,930 --> 00:21:53,940
about it so some of it there might be
 

1125
00:21:53,940 --> 00:21:56,450
about it so some of it there might be

weather sucks and you keep failing and
the other person becomes more successful

1432
00:27:57,110 --> 00:27:57,120
the other person becomes more successful
 

1433
00:27:57,120 --> 00:27:59,870
the other person becomes more successful
plus he's got a new hot wife now there's

1434
00:27:59,870 --> 00:27:59,880
plus he's got a new hot wife now there's
 

1435
00:27:59,880 --> 00:28:02,690
plus he's got a new hot wife now there's
a nice tractor uh does it feel this all

1436
00:28:02,690 --> 00:28:02,700
a nice tractor uh does it feel this all
 

1437
00:28:02,700 --> 00:28:04,430
a nice tractor uh does it feel this all
working and then you get this idea that

1438
00:28:04,430 --> 00:28:04,440
working and then you get this idea that
 

1439
00:28:04,440 --> 00:28:06,470
working and then you get this idea that
you know what I'm gonna steal all this

1440
00:28:06,470 --> 00:28:06,480
you know what I'm gonna steal all this
 

1441
00:28:06,480 --> 00:28:08,810
you know what I'm gonna steal all this
stuff I'm gonna murder him

1442
00:28:08,810 --> 00:28:08,820
stuff I'm gonna murder him
 

1443
00:28:08,820 --> 00:28:10,730
stuff I'm gonna murder him
and that you know don't you think that's

1444
00:28:10,730 --> 00:28:10,740
and that you know don't you think that's
 

1445
00:28:10,740 --> 00:28:12,649
and that you know don't you think that's
just like a leap no I actually think

1446
00:28:12,649 --> 00:28:12,659
just like a leap no I actually think
 

1447
00:28:12,659 --> 00:28:14,390
just like a leap no I actually think
it's the same phenomena no no because

1448
00:28:14,390 --> 00:28:14,400
it's the same phenomena no no because
 

1449
00:28:14,400 --> 00:28:16,430
it's the same phenomena no no because
but I think there are things that are in

1450
00:28:16,430 --> 00:28:16,440
but I think there are things that are in
 

1451
00:28:16,440 --> 00:28:19,310
but I think there are things that are in
us as humans right so so the things are

1452
00:28:19,310 --> 00:28:19,320
us as humans right so so the things are
 

1453
00:28:19,320 --> 00:28:21,350
us as humans right so so the things are
just by being human like we can for

1454
00:28:21,350 --> 00:28:21,360
just by being human like we can for
 

1455
00:28:21,360 --> 00:28:23,090
just by being human like we can for
example feel we can feel compassion

1456
00:28:23,090 --> 00:28:23,100
example feel we can feel compassion
 

1457
00:28:23,100 --> 00:28:25,669
example feel we can feel compassion
right we can feel interest right we can

1458
00:28:25,669 --> 00:28:25,679
right we can feel interest right we can
 

1459
00:28:25,679 --> 00:28:27,649
right we can feel interest right we can
feel jealousy in in that benign sense

1460
00:28:27,649 --> 00:28:27,659
feel jealousy in in that benign sense
 

1461
00:28:27,659 --> 00:28:29,630
feel jealousy in in that benign sense
like it's all part of just being human

1462
00:28:29,630 --> 00:28:29,640
like it's all part of just being human
 

1463
00:28:29,640 --> 00:28:33,110
like it's all part of just being human
if we if we start going from hey you

I'm gonna kill you that that's not that
is not a progression of something benign

1474
00:28:42,409 --> 00:28:42,419
is not a progression of something benign
 

1475
00:28:42,419 --> 00:28:45,049
is not a progression of something benign
right that is but wait wait a minute but

1476
00:28:45,049 --> 00:28:45,059
right that is but wait wait a minute but
 

1477
00:28:45,059 --> 00:28:47,029
right that is but wait wait a minute but
there is a human leap of the same thing

1478
00:28:47,029 --> 00:28:47,039
there is a human leap of the same thing
 

1479
00:28:47,039 --> 00:28:49,970
there is a human leap of the same thing
isn't it is because you're drawing a

1480
00:28:49,970 --> 00:28:49,980
isn't it is because you're drawing a
 

1481
00:28:49,980 --> 00:28:52,310
isn't it is because you're drawing a
line stuff you're saying like this is

1482
00:28:52,310 --> 00:28:52,320
line stuff you're saying like this is
 

1483
00:28:52,320 --> 00:28:54,350
line stuff you're saying like this is
the this human stuff it's regular life

1484
00:28:54,350 --> 00:28:54,360
the this human stuff it's regular life
 

1485
00:28:54,360 --> 00:28:55,789
the this human stuff it's regular life
it's benign

1486
00:28:55,789 --> 00:28:55,799
it's benign
 

1487
00:28:55,799 --> 00:28:57,590
it's benign
but it feels like this benign thing is

1488
00:28:57,590 --> 00:28:57,600
but it feels like this benign thing is
 

1489
00:28:57,600 --> 00:28:59,810
but it feels like this benign thing is
just a low magnitude thing

1490
00:28:59,810 --> 00:28:59,820
just a low magnitude thing
 

1491
00:28:59,820 --> 00:29:02,029
just a low magnitude thing
version of the thing that's not benign

1492
00:29:02,029 --> 00:29:02,039
version of the thing that's not benign
 

1493
00:29:02,039 --> 00:29:04,190
version of the thing that's not benign
because there's there's probably a gray

1494
00:29:04,190 --> 00:29:04,200
because there's there's probably a gray
 

1495
00:29:04,200 --> 00:29:06,049
because there's there's probably a gray
area where it stops being put like

1496
00:29:06,049 --> 00:29:06,059
area where it stops being put like
 

1497
00:29:06,059 --> 00:29:08,390
area where it stops being put like
jealousy you can have like healthy gel

1498
00:29:08,390 --> 00:29:08,400
jealousy you can have like healthy gel
 

1499
00:29:08,400 --> 00:29:10,010
jealousy you can have like healthy gel
so you can have a little bit slightly

1500
00:29:10,010 --> 00:29:10,020
so you can have a little bit slightly
 

1501
00:29:10,020 --> 00:29:12,169
so you can have a little bit slightly
unhealthy there's a that's I think

1502
00:29:12,169 --> 00:29:12,179
unhealthy there's a that's I think
 

1503
00:29:12,179 --> 00:29:14,210
unhealthy there's a that's I think
Jealous Guy this John Lennon song that I

1504
00:29:14,210 --> 00:29:14,220
Jealous Guy this John Lennon song that I
 

1505

1507
00:29:15,600 --> 00:29:18,470
love is just beautiful I mean there's
like this jealousy inside relationships

1508
00:29:18,470 --> 00:29:18,480
like this jealousy inside relationships
 

1509
00:29:18,480 --> 00:29:21,470
like this jealousy inside relationships
can make you feel like uh you know take

directions and it's crazy but like it
 

1515
00:29:26,039 --> 00:29:28,190
directions and it's crazy but like it
feels like that that's an extra neighbor

1516
00:29:28,190 --> 00:29:28,200
feels like that that's an extra neighbor
 

1517
00:29:28,200 --> 00:29:31,130
feels like that that's an extra neighbor
to like being really crazy and toxic and

1518
00:29:31,130 --> 00:29:31,140
to like being really crazy and toxic and
 

1519
00:29:31,140 --> 00:29:31,909
to like being really crazy and toxic and
all that kind of stuff inside

1520
00:29:31,909 --> 00:29:31,919
all that kind of stuff inside
 

1521
00:29:31,919 --> 00:29:33,950
all that kind of stuff inside
relationships and then that feels like a

1522
00:29:33,950 --> 00:29:33,960
relationships and then that feels like a
 

1523
00:29:33,960 --> 00:29:34,850
relationships and then that feels like a
next door neighbor it's like an

1524
00:29:34,850 --> 00:29:34,860
next door neighbor it's like an
 

1525
00:29:34,860 --> 00:29:36,289
next door neighbor it's like an
apartment building that feels like a

1526
00:29:36,289 --> 00:29:36,299
apartment building that feels like a
 

1527
00:29:36,299 --> 00:29:38,510
apartment building that feels like a
next door neighbor uh that eventually

1528
00:29:38,510 --> 00:29:38,520
next door neighbor uh that eventually
 

1529
00:29:38,520 --> 00:29:41,149
next door neighbor uh that eventually
gets to Hitler with uh with envy and

1530
00:29:41,149 --> 00:29:41,159
gets to Hitler with uh with envy and
 

1531
00:29:41,159 --> 00:29:42,590
gets to Hitler with uh with envy and
resentment of entire population of

1532
00:29:42,590 --> 00:29:42,600
resentment of entire population of
 

1533
00:29:42,600 --> 00:29:44,269
resentment of entire population of
people you're right that there's a

1534
00:29:44,269 --> 00:29:44,279
people you're right that there's a
 

1535
00:29:44,279 --> 00:29:46,669
people you're right that there's a
causal yeah there can be a causal chain

1536
00:29:46,669 --> 00:29:46,679
causal yeah there can be a causal chain
 

1537
00:29:46,679 --> 00:29:48,470
causal yeah there can be a causal chain
right like if I'm not feeling jealous

1538
00:29:48,470 --> 00:29:48,480
right like if I'm not feeling jealous
 

1539
00:29:48,480 --> 00:29:51,409
right like if I'm not feeling jealous
maybe I won't ever feel envious right so

1540
00:29:51,409 --> 00:29:51,419
maybe I won't ever feel envious right so
 

1541
00:29:51,419 --> 00:29:53,090
maybe I won't ever feel envious right so
so you can see okay so it can kind of

1542
00:29:53,090 --> 00:29:53,100
so you can see okay so it can kind of
 

1543
00:29:53,100 --> 00:29:55,370
so you can see okay so it can kind of
lead to it can open gates to huh like

1544
00:29:55,370 --> 00:29:55,380
lead to it can open gates to huh like
 

1545
00:29:55,380 --> 00:29:56,990
lead to it can open gates to huh like
how much do I dislike that you have

1546
00:29:56,990 --> 00:29:57,000
how much do I dislike that you have
 

1547
00:29:57,000 --> 00:29:59,450
how much do I dislike that you have
things that I don't have right so yes in

1548
00:29:59,450 --> 00:29:59,460
things that I don't have right so yes in
 

1549
00:29:59,460 --> 00:30:01,909
things that I don't have right so yes in
that sense but and I think this Supply

1550
00:30:01,909 --> 00:30:01,919
that sense but and I think this Supply
 

1551
00:30:01,919 --> 00:30:03,889
that sense but and I think this Supply
that I think is so important that I

1552
00:30:03,889 --> 00:30:03,899
that I think is so important that I
 

1553
00:30:03,899 --> 00:30:06,289
that I think is so important that I
think there is a disjunction right it's

1554
00:30:06,289 --> 00:30:06,299
think there is a disjunction right it's
 

1555
00:30:06,299 --> 00:30:08,450
think there is a disjunction right it's
if there's an asymptotic shift right

1556
00:30:08,450 --> 00:30:08,460
if there's an asymptotic shift right
 

1557
00:30:08,460 --> 00:30:11,029
if there's an asymptotic shift right
from one thing to another because if you

1558
00:30:11,029 --> 00:30:11,039
from one thing to another because if you
 

1559
00:30:11,039 --> 00:30:12,850
from one thing to another because if you
speak in my language mathematically yeah

1560
00:30:12,850 --> 00:30:12,860
speak in my language mathematically yeah
 

1561
00:30:12,860 --> 00:30:16,130
speak in my language mathematically yeah
yeah yes that that's it's a way to

1562
00:30:16,130 --> 00:30:16,140
yeah yes that that's it's a way to
 

1563
00:30:16,140 --> 00:30:17,870
yeah yes that that's it's a way to
convey right something that's entirely

1564
00:30:17,870 --> 00:30:17,880
convey right something that's entirely
 

1565
00:30:17,880 --> 00:30:20,210
convey right something that's entirely
different because if I start thinking

1566
00:30:20,210 --> 00:30:20,220
different because if I start thinking
 

1567
00:30:20,220 --> 00:30:22,549
different because if I start thinking
you know I'm not going to try and make

1568
00:30:22,549 --> 00:30:22,559
you know I'm not going to try and make
 

1569
00:30:22,559 --> 00:30:24,830
you know I'm not going to try and make
things better right I'd like instead to

1570
00:30:24,830 --> 00:30:24,840
things better right I'd like instead to
 

1571
00:30:24,840 --> 00:30:27,169
things better right I'd like instead to
harm you that's that's qualitatively

1572
00:30:27,169 --> 00:30:27,179
harm you that's that's qualitatively
 

1573
00:30:27,179 --> 00:30:29,210
harm you that's that's qualitatively
different oh it's almost like you know

1574
00:30:29,210 --> 00:30:29,220
different oh it's almost like you know
 

1575
00:30:29,220 --> 00:30:31,250
different oh it's almost like you know
what it is it could be I don't know what

1576
00:30:31,250 --> 00:30:31,260
what it is it could be I don't know what
 

1577
00:30:31,260 --> 00:30:32,690
what it is it could be I don't know what
you think about this but

1578
00:30:32,690 --> 00:30:32,700
you think about this but
 

1579
00:30:32,700 --> 00:30:36,409
you think about this but
is uh in which direction

1580
00:30:36,409 --> 00:30:36,419
is uh in which direction
 

1581
00:30:36,419 --> 00:30:40,250
is uh in which direction
your motivation is pointing so if in the

1582
00:30:40,250 --> 00:30:40,260
your motivation is pointing so if in the
 

1583
00:30:40,260 --> 00:30:42,529

think ultimately in our subject of

1982
00:38:15,530 --> 00:38:15,540
think ultimately in our subject of
 

1983
00:38:15,540 --> 00:38:18,410
think ultimately in our subject of
Hitler as as evil if Hitler had kept

ultimately he would have been the only
 

1989
00:38:21,420 --> 00:38:22,670
ultimately he would have been the only
person on Earth

1990

person on Earth
 

1991
00:38:22,680 --> 00:38:23,930
person on Earth
right and I really do believe that

right and I really do believe that
 

1993
00:38:23,940 --> 00:38:25,609
right and I really do believe that
ultimately everyone everything else

1994
00:38:25,609 --> 00:38:25,619
ultimately everyone everything else
 

1995
00:38:25,619 --> 00:38:27,710
ultimately everyone everything else
would be killed because it's such

1996
00:38:27,710 --> 00:38:27,720
would be killed because it's such
 

1997
00:38:27,720 --> 00:38:29,270

destruction right destroy everything

destruction right destroy everything
 

1999
00:38:29,280 --> 00:38:32,329
destruction right destroy everything
right and probably when that didn't work

2000
00:38:32,329 --> 00:38:32,339
right and probably when that didn't work
 

2001
00:38:32,339 --> 00:38:34,069
right and probably when that didn't work
then there's the destruction of the self

2002
00:38:34,069 --> 00:38:34,079
then there's the destruction of the self
 

2003
00:38:34,079 --> 00:38:35,630
then there's the destruction of the self
right because

2004
00:38:35,630 --> 00:38:35,640
right because
 

2005
00:38:35,640 --> 00:38:38,450
right because
nothing

2006
00:38:38,450 --> 00:38:38,460

 

2007
00:38:38,460 --> 00:38:40,130

soothes

2008
00:38:40,130 --> 00:38:40,140
soothes
 

2009
00:38:40,140 --> 00:38:43,310
soothes
envy that is stoked by the sort of

00:38:43,310 --> 00:38:43,320
envy that is stoked by the sort of
 

2011
00:38:43,320 --> 00:38:46,069
envy that is stoked by the sort of
flames of evil and what you see is more

2012
00:38:46,069 --> 00:38:46,079
flames of evil and what you see is more
 

2013
00:38:46,079 --> 00:38:47,329
flames of evil and what you see is more
and more anger and more and more

2014
00:38:47,329 --> 00:38:47,339
and more anger and more and more
 

2015
00:38:47,339 --> 00:38:48,829
and more anger and more and more
frustration which is why I really do

2016
00:38:48,829 --> 00:38:48,839
frustration which is why I really do
 

2017
00:38:48,839 --> 00:38:50,870
frustration which is why I really do
believe someone like that who who

2018

nurtured evil in themselves that way

2020
00:38:52,730 --> 00:38:52,740
nurtured evil in themselves that way
 

2021
00:38:52,740 --> 00:38:54,710
nurtured evil in themselves that way
ultimately would would destroy they'd be

2022
00:38:54,710 --> 00:38:54,720
ultimately would would destroy they'd be
 

2023
00:38:54,720 --> 00:38:56,390

like him and one other person then he'd

2024
00:38:56,390 --> 00:38:56,400
like him and one other person then he'd
 

2025
00:38:56,400 --> 00:38:58,010
like him and one other person then he'd
kill the other person I think that's

2026
00:38:58,010 --> 00:38:58,020
kill the other person I think that's
 

2027
00:38:58,020 --> 00:39:01,010
kill the other person I think that's
really powerfully said but even just to

2028
00:39:01,010 --> 00:39:01,020
really powerfully said but even just to
 

2029
00:39:01,020 --> 00:39:04,130
really powerfully said but even just to
return to the jealousy versus Envy I

2030
00:39:04,130 --> 00:39:04,140
return to the jealousy versus Envy I
 

2031

still think that it's the same Flame
 

2033
00:39:08,700 --> 00:39:11,089
still think that it's the same Flame
and envy is just the bigger version of

and envy is just the bigger version of
 

2035
00:39:11,099 --> 00:39:13,130
and envy is just the bigger version of
it so I I think

nowhere in there was the emergence of
evil I just disagree with that I think

2147
00:41:19,680 --> 00:41:23,510
evil I just disagree with that I think
there was a choice made where I I looked

2148
00:41:23,510 --> 00:41:23,520
there was a choice made where I I looked
 

2149

there was a choice made where I I looked
at my if my life was darker more

at my if my life was darker more
difficult I think it has nothing to do

2152
00:41:28,730 --> 00:41:28,740
difficult I think it has nothing to do
 

2153
00:41:28,740 --> 00:41:31,250
difficult I think it has nothing to do
with the actual little flame of jealousy

2154
00:41:31,250 --> 00:41:31,260
with the actual little flame of jealousy
 

2155
00:41:31,260 --> 00:41:33,530
with the actual little flame of jealousy
I felt I think he has to do a lot more

00:41:33,530 --> 00:41:33,540
I felt I think he has to do a lot more
 

2157
00:41:33,540 --> 00:41:36,770
I felt I think he has to do a lot more
with the other context if if I

2158
00:41:36,770 --> 00:41:36,780
with the other context if if I
 

2159
00:41:36,780 --> 00:41:39,890
with the other context if if I
if if my life were more difficult there

2160
00:41:39,890 --> 00:41:39,900
if if my life were more difficult there
 

2161

I think that decision I could have made
 

2165
00:41:45,119 --> 00:41:46,790
I think that decision I could have made
that decision a different direction yes

2166
00:41:46,790 --> 00:41:46,800
that decision a different direction yes
 

2167
00:41:46,800 --> 00:41:48,890
that decision a different direction yes
maybe I don't know

2168
00:41:48,890 --> 00:41:48,900

about trauma if there's a bit more

2172
00:41:52,730 --> 00:41:52,740
about trauma if there's a bit more
 

2173
00:41:52,740 --> 00:41:55,730
about trauma if there's a bit more
trauma as the background noise of my

2174
00:41:55,730 --> 00:41:55,740
trauma as the background noise of my
 

2175
00:41:55,740 --> 00:41:58,310
trauma as the background noise of my
decision making I'll be more likely to

2176
00:41:58,310 --> 00:41:58,320
decision making I'll be more likely to
 

2177
00:41:58,320 --> 00:42:01,310
decision making I'll be more likely to
uh not be able to uh pull away from the

2178
00:42:01,310 --> 00:42:01,320
uh not be able to uh pull away from the
 

2179
00:42:01,320 --> 00:42:02,990
uh not be able to uh pull away from the
gravitational field of that jealous

2180
00:42:02,990 --> 00:42:03,000
gravitational field of that jealous
 

2181
00:42:03,000 --> 00:42:04,190
gravitational field of that jealous
Scene It would build and build and build

2182
00:42:04,190 --> 00:42:04,200
Scene It would build and build and build
 

2183
00:42:04,200 --> 00:42:07,010
Scene It would build and build and build
a build so I think I it's not to

2184
00:42:07,010 --> 00:42:07,020
a build so I think I it's not to
 

2185
00:42:07,020 --> 00:42:10,250
a build so I think I it's not to
disagree with the brilliant a person but

2186
00:42:10,250 --> 00:42:10,260
disagree with the brilliant a person but
 

2187

has the capacity to engulf the whole

2190
00:42:15,410 --> 00:42:15,420
has the capacity to engulf the whole
 

2191
00:42:15,420 --> 00:42:17,390
has the capacity to engulf the whole
world I guess the initial flame of

2192
00:42:17,390 --> 00:42:17,400
world I guess the initial flame of
 

2193
00:42:17,400 --> 00:42:19,609
world I guess the initial flame of
jealousy the little bit like especially

person because that could also I I just
 

2231
00:43:04,079 --> 00:43:05,870
person because that could also I I just
think the capacity in that initial

2232
00:43:05,870 --> 00:43:05,880
think the capacity in that initial
 

2233
00:43:05,880 --> 00:43:07,849
think the capacity in that initial
feeling is there and I think it's the

00:43:42,410 --> 00:43:42,420
um a heuristic we could agree on right
 

2261
00:43:42,420 --> 00:43:45,470
um a heuristic we could agree on right
let's see so let's say okay if we look

00:43:45,470 --> 00:43:45,480
let's see so let's say okay if we look
 

2263

right so if I'm feeling happy satisfied

2266
00:43:50,750 --> 00:43:50,760
right so if I'm feeling happy satisfied
 

2267
00:43:50,760 --> 00:43:53,089
right so if I'm feeling happy satisfied
probably like I'm pretty far from from

00:43:53,089 --> 00:43:53,099
probably like I'm pretty far from from
 

2269

probably like I'm pretty far from from
Envy land right right but but if I'm

2270
00:43:55,849 --> 00:43:55,859
Envy land right right but but if I'm
 

2271
00:43:55,859 --> 00:43:58,970
Envy land right right but but if I'm
feeling jealousy now I'm I'm I'm coming

feeling jealousy now I'm I'm I'm coming
 

2273
00:43:58,980 --> 00:44:02,930
feeling jealousy now I'm I'm I'm coming
kind of closer to that border right and

2274
00:44:02,930 --> 00:44:02,940
kind of closer to that border right and
 

2275
00:44:02,940 --> 00:44:05,750
kind of closer to that border right and
I still I think there's it's a big thing

2276
00:44:05,750 --> 00:44:05,760
I still I think there's it's a big thing
 

2277
00:44:05,760 --> 00:44:07,309
I still I think there's it's a big thing
to go over the border right that the

2278
00:44:07,309 --> 00:44:07,319
to go over the border right that the
 

2279
00:44:07,319 --> 00:44:09,530
to go over the border right that the
Border isn't a gray area right there's a

2280
00:44:09,530 --> 00:44:09,540
Border isn't a gray area right there's a
 

2281
00:44:09,540 --> 00:44:11,750
Border isn't a gray area right there's a
border to go over and I think that you

2282
00:44:11,750 --> 00:44:11,760
border to go over and I think that you
 

2283
00:44:11,760 --> 00:44:14,030
border to go over and I think that you
you I agree completely once certainly

2284
00:44:14,030 --> 00:44:14,040
you I agree completely once certainly
 

2285
00:44:14,040 --> 00:44:16,190
you I agree completely once certainly
about trauma that the more trauma there

2286
00:44:16,190 --> 00:44:16,200
about trauma that the more trauma there
 

2287
00:44:16,200 --> 00:44:17,569
about trauma that the more trauma there
is because then the more

2288
00:44:17,569 --> 00:44:17,579
is because then the more
 

2289
00:44:17,579 --> 00:44:19,190
is because then the more
misunderstandings there are about self

2290
00:44:19,190 --> 00:44:19,200
misunderstandings there are about self
 

2291
00:44:19,200 --> 00:44:20,390
misunderstandings there are about self
and feelings that I'm not good enough

2292
00:44:20,390 --> 00:44:20,400
and feelings that I'm not good enough
 

2293
00:44:20,400 --> 00:44:22,550
and feelings that I'm not good enough
and then that can be anger about why and

2294
00:44:22,550 --> 00:44:22,560
and then that can be anger about why and
 

2295
00:44:22,560 --> 00:44:24,349
and then that can be anger about why and
who might be oppressing me and you know

2296
00:44:24,349 --> 00:44:24,359
who might be oppressing me and you know
 

2297
00:44:24,359 --> 00:44:26,150
who might be oppressing me and you know
I hate myself and everyone else who

2298
00:44:26,150 --> 00:44:26,160
I hate myself and everyone else who
 

2299
00:44:26,160 --> 00:44:28,010
I hate myself and everyone else who
seems to be better like so the trauma

2300
00:44:28,010 --> 00:44:28,020
seems to be better like so the trauma
 

2301
00:44:28,020 --> 00:44:29,870
seems to be better like so the trauma
can drive us in these negative

2302
00:44:29,870 --> 00:44:29,880
can drive us in these negative
 

2303
00:44:29,880 --> 00:44:32,329
can drive us in these negative
directions but we're still crossing over

2304
00:44:32,329 --> 00:44:32,339
directions but we're still crossing over
 

2305
00:44:32,339 --> 00:44:34,550
directions but we're still crossing over
something right so so if you have the

2306
00:44:34,550 --> 00:44:34,560
something right so so if you have the
 

2307
00:44:34,560 --> 00:44:36,650
something right so so if you have the
trinket and I think that's awesome I

2308
00:44:36,650 --> 00:44:36,660
trinket and I think that's awesome I
 

2309
00:44:36,660 --> 00:44:39,170
trinket and I think that's awesome I
want that I want to work harder you know

2310
00:44:39,170 --> 00:44:39,180
want that I want to work harder you know
 

2311
00:44:39,180 --> 00:44:41,270
want that I want to work harder you know
what I could do though is I could sneak

2312
00:44:41,270 --> 00:44:41,280
what I could do though is I could sneak
 

2313
00:44:41,280 --> 00:44:42,950
what I could do though is I could sneak
in tonight when no one's around and I

2314
00:44:42,950 --> 00:44:42,960
in tonight when no one's around and I
 

2315
00:44:42,960 --> 00:44:44,510
in tonight when no one's around and I
could move something around no no way I

2316
00:44:44,510 --> 00:44:44,520
could move something around no no way I
 

2317
00:44:44,520 --> 00:44:45,710
could move something around no no way I
don't want to do that right but it's

2318
00:44:45,710 --> 00:44:45,720
don't want to do that right but it's
 

2319
00:44:45,720 --> 00:44:47,270
don't want to do that right but it's
like I came over the Border a little bit

2320
00:44:47,270 --> 00:44:47,280
like I came over the Border a little bit
 

2321
00:44:47,280 --> 00:44:49,130
like I came over the Border a little bit
and I thought maybe maybe that's a

2322
00:44:49,130 --> 00:44:49,140
and I thought maybe maybe that's a
 

2323
00:44:49,140 --> 00:44:50,809
and I thought maybe maybe that's a
better way but then I came back right

2324
00:44:50,809 --> 00:44:50,819
better way but then I came back right
 

2325
00:44:50,819 --> 00:44:53,390
better way but then I came back right
and I'm and you're we're responsible for

2326
00:44:53,390 --> 00:44:53,400
and I'm and you're we're responsible for
 

2327
00:44:53,400 --> 00:44:55,730
and I'm and you're we're responsible for
that right because it is a choice to say

2328
00:44:55,730 --> 00:44:55,740
that right because it is a choice to say
 

2329
00:44:55,740 --> 00:44:56,990
that right because it is a choice to say
I don't want to work hard I'm already

2330
00:44:56,990 --> 00:44:57,000
I don't want to work hard I'm already
 

2331
00:44:57,000 --> 00:44:58,490
I don't want to work hard I'm already
working how how hard I don't want to

2332
00:44:58,490 --> 00:44:58,500
working how how hard I don't want to
 

2333
00:44:58,500 --> 00:44:59,690
working how how hard I don't want to
make my trinket better I want to think

00:44:59,690 --> 00:44:59,700
make my trinket better I want to think
 

2335
00:44:59,700 --> 00:45:01,849
make my trinket better I want to think
mine's the best one I could destroy

2336
00:45:01,849 --> 00:45:01,859
mine's the best one I could destroy
 

2337
00:45:01,859 --> 00:45:03,710
mine's the best one I could destroy
yours right and you know we're letting

2338
00:45:03,710 --> 00:45:03,720
yours right and you know we're letting
 

2339
00:45:03,720 --> 00:45:06,230
yours right and you know we're letting
our mind go over that border and do we

2340
00:45:06,230 --> 00:45:06,240
our mind go over that border and do we
 

2341
00:45:06,240 --> 00:45:08,329
our mind go over that border and do we
say right run that forward right let's

2342
00:45:08,329 --> 00:45:08,339
say right run that forward right let's
 

2343
00:45:08,339 --> 00:45:09,650
say right run that forward right let's
run that forward and put people around

2344
00:45:09,650 --> 00:45:09,660
run that forward and put people around
 

2345
00:45:09,660 --> 00:45:11,329
run that forward and put people around
us who feel the same way and start doing

2346
00:45:11,329 --> 00:45:11,339
us who feel the same way and start doing
 

2347
00:45:11,339 --> 00:45:13,190
us who feel the same way and start doing
it so we think less of ourselves and we

2348
00:45:13,190 --> 00:45:13,200
it so we think less of ourselves and we
 

2349
00:45:13,200 --> 00:45:15,770
it so we think less of ourselves and we
debase ourselves do we run headlong in

2350
00:45:15,770 --> 00:45:15,780
debase ourselves do we run headlong in
 

2351
00:45:15,780 --> 00:45:18,470
debase ourselves do we run headlong in
or do we come over that boundary and

2352
00:45:18,470 --> 00:45:18,480
or do we come over that boundary and
 

2353
00:45:18,480 --> 00:45:20,329
or do we come over that boundary and
that's maybe the capacity for evil in us

2354
00:45:20,329 --> 00:45:20,339
that's maybe the capacity for evil in us
 

2355
00:45:20,339 --> 00:45:22,250
that's maybe the capacity for evil in us
that we come over that boundary all of

2356
00:45:22,250 --> 00:45:22,260
that we come over that boundary all of
 

2357
00:45:22,260 --> 00:45:25,309
that we come over that boundary all of
us right at times but do we come over it

2358
00:45:25,309 --> 00:45:25,319
us right at times but do we come over it
 

2359
00:45:25,319 --> 00:45:27,050
us right at times but do we come over it
and then said no that that's not my

2360
00:45:27,050 --> 00:45:27,060
and then said no that that's not my
 

2361
00:45:27,060 --> 00:45:29,930
and then said no that that's not my
choice that's not my self-definition I'm

2362
00:45:29,930 --> 00:45:29,940
choice that's not my self-definition I'm
 

2363
00:45:29,940 --> 00:45:31,550
choice that's not my self-definition I'm
coming back but I'm trying to justify

2364
00:45:31,550 --> 00:45:31,560
coming back but I'm trying to justify
 

2365
00:45:31,560 --> 00:45:32,930
coming back but I'm trying to justify
maybe there are certain other

2366
00:45:32,930 --> 00:45:32,940
maybe there are certain other
 

2367
00:45:32,940 --> 00:45:35,030
maybe there are certain other
sociological forces that help us cross

2368
00:45:35,030 --> 00:45:35,040
sociological forces that help us cross
 

2369
00:45:35,040 --> 00:45:38,450
sociological forces that help us cross
the border too so in Nazi Germany we've

2370
00:45:38,450 --> 00:45:38,460
the border too so in Nazi Germany we've
 

2371
00:45:38,460 --> 00:45:40,010
the border too so in Nazi Germany we've
been talking about Hitler but then

2372
00:45:40,010 --> 00:45:40,020
been talking about Hitler but then
 

2373
00:45:40,020 --> 00:45:43,609
been talking about Hitler but then
there's also the the German people and

2374
00:45:43,609 --> 00:45:43,619
there's also the the German people and
 

2375
00:45:43,619 --> 00:45:45,290
there's also the the German people and
so maybe when there's a bit of a mass

2376
00:45:45,290 --> 00:45:45,300
so maybe when there's a bit of a mass
 

2377
00:45:45,300 --> 00:45:48,710
so maybe when there's a bit of a mass
hysteria so all these effects of like uh

2378
00:45:48,710 --> 00:45:48,720
hysteria so all these effects of like uh
 

2379
00:45:48,720 --> 00:45:52,130
hysteria so all these effects of like uh
combination of propaganda with the small

2380
00:45:52,130 --> 00:45:52,140
combination of propaganda with the small
 

2381
00:45:52,140 --> 00:45:53,990
combination of propaganda with the small
jealousies and resentments of the people

2382
00:45:53,990 --> 00:45:54,000
jealousies and resentments of the people
 

2383
00:45:54,000 --> 00:45:56,630
jealousies and resentments of the people
that don't cross the border uh uh

2384
00:45:56,630 --> 00:45:56,640
that don't cross the border uh uh
 

2385
00:45:56,640 --> 00:45:59,089
that don't cross the border uh uh
together they can with with great

2386
00:45:59,089 --> 00:45:59,099
together they can with with great
 

2387
00:45:59,099 --> 00:46:01,910
together they can with with great
charismatic leaders that sort of uh

2388
00:46:01,910 --> 00:46:01,920
charismatic leaders that sort of uh
 

2389
00:46:01,920 --> 00:46:04,069
charismatic leaders that sort of uh
really fuel that fire that we feel when

2390
00:46:04,069 --> 00:46:04,079
really fuel that fire that we feel when
 

2391
00:46:04,079 --> 00:46:05,930
really fuel that fire that we feel when
we're part of the crowd so maybe those

2392
00:46:05,930 --> 00:46:05,940
we're part of the crowd so maybe those
 

2393
00:46:05,940 --> 00:46:07,309
we're part of the crowd so maybe those
individual kind of psychological

2394
00:46:07,309 --> 00:46:07,319
individual kind of psychological
 

2395
00:46:07,319 --> 00:46:09,890
individual kind of psychological
barriers we have to take that leap from

2396
00:46:09,890 --> 00:46:09,900
barriers we have to take that leap from
 

2397
00:46:09,900 --> 00:46:12,650
barriers we have to take that leap from
jealousy to Envy those can be made

2398
00:46:12,650 --> 00:46:12,660
jealousy to Envy those can be made
 

2399
00:46:12,660 --> 00:46:14,870
jealousy to Envy those can be made
easier the the leap can be catalyzed

2400
00:46:14,870 --> 00:46:14,880
easier the the leap can be catalyzed
 

2401
00:46:14,880 --> 00:46:18,950
easier the the leap can be catalyzed
through this mess 100 100 I think that

2402
00:46:18,950 --> 00:46:18,960
through this mess 100 100 I think that
 

2403
00:46:18,960 --> 00:46:20,870
through this mess 100 100 I think that
to me is a massive point we're talking

2404
00:46:20,870 --> 00:46:20,880
to me is a massive point we're talking
 

2405
00:46:20,880 --> 00:46:22,550
to me is a massive point we're talking
about layers of emergence right so if

2406
00:46:22,550 --> 00:46:22,560
about layers of emergence right so if
 

2407
00:46:22,560 --> 00:46:24,650
about layers of emergence right so if
there's individual Consciousness then

2408
00:46:24,650 --> 00:46:24,660
there's individual Consciousness then
 

2409
00:46:24,660 --> 00:46:26,690
there's individual Consciousness then
there's culture right and you know we're

2410
00:46:26,690 --> 00:46:26,700
there's culture right and you know we're
 

2411
00:46:26,700 --> 00:46:28,309
there's culture right and you know we're
products of the soup we swim in so to

2412
00:46:28,309 --> 00:46:28,319
products of the soup we swim in so to
 

2413
00:46:28,319 --> 00:46:29,450
products of the soup we swim in so to
speak people would say that when I was

2414
00:46:29,450 --> 00:46:29,460
speak people would say that when I was
 

2415
00:46:29,460 --> 00:46:31,309
speak people would say that when I was
growing up right we're products of the

2416
00:46:31,309 --> 00:46:31,319
growing up right we're products of the
 

2417
00:46:31,319 --> 00:46:33,109
growing up right we're products of the
soup we swim in so if the soup that

2418
00:46:33,109 --> 00:46:33,119
soup we swim in so if the soup that
 

2419
00:46:33,119 --> 00:46:35,450
soup we swim in so if the soup that
we're swimming in is the soup of hatred

2420
00:46:35,450 --> 00:46:35,460
we're swimming in is the soup of hatred
 

2421
00:46:35,460 --> 00:46:38,210
we're swimming in is the soup of hatred
yeah right then it's going to Foster all

2422
00:46:38,210 --> 00:46:38,220
yeah right then it's going to Foster all
 

2423
00:46:38,220 --> 00:46:39,530
yeah right then it's going to Foster all
of those things so then you think about

2424
00:46:39,530 --> 00:46:39,540
of those things so then you think about
 

2425
00:46:39,540 --> 00:46:41,569
of those things so then you think about
just in a painting with a very broad

2426
00:46:41,569 --> 00:46:41,579
just in a painting with a very broad
 

2427
00:46:41,579 --> 00:46:44,089
just in a painting with a very broad
brush the culture created in Germany

2428
00:46:44,089 --> 00:46:44,099
brush the culture created in Germany
 

2429
00:46:44,099 --> 00:46:46,309
brush the culture created in Germany
prior to the second world war and like

2430
00:46:46,309 --> 00:46:46,319
prior to the second world war and like
 

2431
00:46:46,319 --> 00:46:48,589
prior to the second world war and like
what was the impact of the reparations

2432
00:46:48,589 --> 00:46:48,599
what was the impact of the reparations
 

2433
00:46:48,599 --> 00:46:50,450
what was the impact of the reparations
after the first world war right of the

2434
00:46:50,450 --> 00:46:50,460
after the first world war right of the
 

2435
00:46:50,460 --> 00:46:52,670
after the first world war right of the
the punishing reparations impoverishment

2436
00:46:52,670 --> 00:46:52,680
the punishing reparations impoverishment
 

2437
00:46:52,680 --> 00:46:54,950
the punishing reparations impoverishment
and you know basically humiliation right

2438
00:46:54,950 --> 00:46:54,960
and you know basically humiliation right
 

2439
00:46:54,960 --> 00:46:57,109
and you know basically humiliation right
that people were feeling okay like

2440
00:46:57,109 --> 00:46:57,119
that people were feeling okay like
 

2441
00:46:57,119 --> 00:46:58,609
that people were feeling okay like
that's there were a whole bunch of

2442
00:46:58,609 --> 00:46:58,619
that's there were a whole bunch of
 

2443
00:46:58,619 --> 00:47:00,890
that's there were a whole bunch of
decisions that impacted that cultural

2444
00:47:00,890 --> 00:47:00,900
decisions that impacted that cultural
 

2445
00:47:00,900 --> 00:47:02,870
decisions that impacted that cultural
perspective right then there must have

2446
00:47:02,870 --> 00:47:02,880
perspective right then there must have
 

2447
00:47:02,880 --> 00:47:04,910
perspective right then there must have
been aspects just like I see in many

2448
00:47:04,910 --> 00:47:04,920
been aspects just like I see in many
 

2449
00:47:04,920 --> 00:47:08,750
been aspects just like I see in many
ways parallels in in America now of what

2450
00:47:08,750 --> 00:47:08,760
ways parallels in in America now of what
 

2451
00:47:08,760 --> 00:47:11,270
ways parallels in in America now of what
are our standards for what we're

2452
00:47:11,270 --> 00:47:11,280
are our standards for what we're
 

2453
00:47:11,280 --> 00:47:13,250
are our standards for what we're
communicating to others right how is the

2454
00:47:13,250 --> 00:47:13,260
communicating to others right how is the
 

2455
00:47:13,260 --> 00:47:14,870
communicating to others right how is the
media deciding like what's real and

2456
00:47:14,870 --> 00:47:14,880
media deciding like what's real and
 

2457
00:47:14,880 --> 00:47:17,089
media deciding like what's real and
what's not real what's true what's not

2458
00:47:17,089 --> 00:47:17,099
what's not real what's true what's not
 

2459
00:47:17,099 --> 00:47:19,730
what's not real what's true what's not
true what's hatred that that is only

2460
00:47:19,730 --> 00:47:19,740
true what's hatred that that is only
 

2461
00:47:19,740 --> 00:47:22,309
true what's hatred that that is only
going to do evil versus what's hatred

2462
00:47:22,309 --> 00:47:22,319
going to do evil versus what's hatred
 

2463
00:47:22,319 --> 00:47:23,750
going to do evil versus what's hatred
that's okay because I might sell

2464
00:47:23,750 --> 00:47:23,760
that's okay because I might sell
 

2465
00:47:23,760 --> 00:47:26,450
that's okay because I might sell
something by by putting it out there I

2466
00:47:26,450 --> 00:47:26,460
something by by putting it out there I
 

2467
00:47:26,460 --> 00:47:28,990
something by by putting it out there I
mean that was we know that was going on

2468
00:47:28,990 --> 00:47:29,000
mean that was we know that was going on
 

2469
00:47:29,000 --> 00:47:31,970
mean that was we know that was going on
in Germany during the rise of the Nazis

2470
00:47:31,970 --> 00:47:31,980
in Germany during the rise of the Nazis
 

2471
00:47:31,980 --> 00:47:34,069
in Germany during the rise of the Nazis
and and I think there's a parallel to

2472
00:47:34,069 --> 00:47:34,079
and and I think there's a parallel to
 

2473
00:47:34,079 --> 00:47:36,349
and and I think there's a parallel to
you know do we value truth do can we

2474
00:47:36,349 --> 00:47:36,359
you know do we value truth do can we
 

2475
00:47:36,359 --> 00:47:37,790
you know do we value truth do can we
stand together and say no matter how

2476
00:47:37,790 --> 00:47:37,800
stand together and say no matter how
 

2477
00:47:37,800 --> 00:47:39,109
stand together and say no matter how
much I might disagree with you

2478
00:47:39,109 --> 00:47:39,119
much I might disagree with you
 

2479
00:47:39,119 --> 00:47:40,790
much I might disagree with you
politically right we can still

2480
00:47:40,790 --> 00:47:40,800
politically right we can still
 

2481
00:47:40,800 --> 00:47:42,290
politically right we can still
understand like that there's there's

2482
00:47:42,290 --> 00:47:42,300
understand like that there's there's
 

2483
00:47:42,300 --> 00:47:43,670
understand like that there's there's
right and there's wrong right there's

2484
00:47:43,670 --> 00:47:43,680
right and there's wrong right there's
 

2485
00:47:43,680 --> 00:47:46,010
right and there's wrong right there's
truth and there's lies right so so I

2486
00:47:46,010 --> 00:47:46,020
truth and there's lies right so so I
 

2487
00:47:46,020 --> 00:47:48,230
truth and there's lies right so so I
think those are just two examples of

2488
00:47:48,230 --> 00:47:48,240
think those are just two examples of
 

2489
00:47:48,240 --> 00:47:50,450
think those are just two examples of
determinants of culture and then the

2490
00:47:50,450 --> 00:47:50,460
determinants of culture and then the
 

2491
00:47:50,460 --> 00:47:53,270
determinants of culture and then the
culture is a determinant of you know is

2492
00:47:53,270 --> 00:47:53,280
culture is a determinant of you know is
 

2493
00:47:53,280 --> 00:47:56,329
culture is a determinant of you know is
someone like Hitler marginalizes like

2494
00:47:56,329 --> 00:47:56,339
someone like Hitler marginalizes like
 

2495
00:47:56,339 --> 00:47:58,670
someone like Hitler marginalizes like
that's a that's a crazy evil person oh

2496
00:47:58,670 --> 00:47:58,680
that's a that's a crazy evil person oh
 

2497
00:47:58,680 --> 00:48:01,609
that's a that's a crazy evil person oh
my goodness like whoa right or is that

2498
00:48:01,609 --> 00:48:01,619
my goodness like whoa right or is that
 

2499
00:48:01,619 --> 00:48:03,290
my goodness like whoa right or is that
someone who gains a greater following

2500
00:48:03,290 --> 00:48:03,300
someone who gains a greater following
 

2501
00:48:03,300 --> 00:48:05,329
someone who gains a greater following
and more adherence and then there starts

2502
00:48:05,329 --> 00:48:05,339
and more adherence and then there starts
 

2503
00:48:05,339 --> 00:48:07,670
and more adherence and then there starts
to be a momentum because why because

2504
00:48:07,670 --> 00:48:07,680
to be a momentum because why because
 

2505
00:48:07,680 --> 00:48:09,950
to be a momentum because why because
what did demagogues do I think they they

2506
00:48:09,950 --> 00:48:09,960
what did demagogues do I think they they
 

2507
00:48:09,960 --> 00:48:12,470

things worse for you people often talk
 

2775
00:53:43,800 --> 00:53:45,770
things worse for you people often talk
about narcissism as like the opposite of

2776
00:53:45,770 --> 00:53:45,780
about narcissism as like the opposite of
 

2777
00:53:45,780 --> 00:53:47,030
about narcissism as like the opposite of
empathy

2778
00:53:47,030 --> 00:53:47,040
empathy
 

2779
00:53:47,040 --> 00:53:51,109
empathy
uh-huh but sort of empathy again depends

2780
00:53:51,109 --> 00:53:51,119
uh-huh but sort of empathy again depends
 

2781
00:53:51,119 --> 00:53:54,109
uh-huh but sort of empathy again depends
how you define it but it's a

2782
00:53:54,109 --> 00:53:54,119
how you define it but it's a
 

2783
00:53:54,119 --> 00:53:57,170
how you define it but it's a
is a is a careful consideration

2784
00:53:57,170 --> 00:53:57,180
is a is a careful consideration
 

2785
00:53:57,180 --> 00:54:00,170
is a is a careful consideration
of the mental space of another person of

2786
00:54:00,170 --> 00:54:00,180
of the mental space of another person of
 

2787
00:54:00,180 --> 00:54:02,210
of the mental space of another person of
how the other person sees the world

2788
00:54:02,210 --> 00:54:02,220
how the other person sees the world
 

2789
00:54:02,220 --> 00:54:04,910
how the other person sees the world
and and so you're kind of saying that

2790
00:54:04,910 --> 00:54:04,920
and and so you're kind of saying that
 

2791
00:54:04,920 --> 00:54:07,549
and and so you're kind of saying that
narcissism narcissistic people would be

2792
00:54:07,549 --> 00:54:07,559
narcissism narcissistic people would be
 

2793
00:54:07,559 --> 00:54:10,250
narcissism narcissistic people would be
also be very good at that in in order to

2794
00:54:10,250 --> 00:54:10,260
also be very good at that in in order to
 

2795
00:54:10,260 --> 00:54:11,450
also be very good at that in in order to
understand

2796
00:54:11,450 --> 00:54:11,460
understand
 

2797
00:54:11,460 --> 00:54:13,069
understand
how maybe the other person can be

2798
00:54:13,069 --> 00:54:13,079
how maybe the other person can be
 

2799
00:54:13,079 --> 00:54:15,049
how maybe the other person can be
manipulated or something to alleviate

2800
00:54:15,049 --> 00:54:15,059
manipulated or something to alleviate
 

2801
00:54:15,059 --> 00:54:17,089
manipulated or something to alleviate
your sense of inadequacy right so

2802
00:54:17,089 --> 00:54:17,099
your sense of inadequacy right so
 

2803
00:54:17,099 --> 00:54:18,230
your sense of inadequacy right so
there's a difference between the

2804
00:54:18,230 --> 00:54:18,240
there's a difference between the
 

2805
00:54:18,240 --> 00:54:20,270
there's a difference between the
mechanics of empathy so let's say again

2806
00:54:20,270 --> 00:54:20,280
mechanics of empathy so let's say again
 

2807
00:54:20,280 --> 00:54:21,890
mechanics of empathy so let's say again
we can Define things different ways

2808
00:54:21,890 --> 00:54:21,900
we can Define things different ways
 

2809
00:54:21,900 --> 00:54:24,170
we can Define things different ways
let's say empathic Attunement is the

2810

let's say empathic Attunement is the
 

2811
00:54:24,180 --> 00:54:25,970
let's say empathic Attunement is the
ability to be attuned and to think okay

2812
00:54:25,970 --> 00:54:25,980
ability to be attuned and to think okay
 

2813
00:54:25,980 --> 00:54:28,130
ability to be attuned and to think okay
what's going on in you what might you be

2814
00:54:28,130 --> 00:54:28,140
what's going on in you what might you be
 

2815
00:54:28,140 --> 00:54:30,349
what's going on in you what might you be
thinking what might you be feeling some

2816
00:54:30,349 --> 00:54:30,359
thinking what might you be feeling some
 

2817
00:54:30,359 --> 00:54:32,030
thinking what might you be feeling some
people have a lot of empathic Attunement

2818
00:54:32,030 --> 00:54:32,040
people have a lot of empathic Attunement
 

2819
00:54:32,040 --> 00:54:34,370
people have a lot of empathic Attunement
but that's a that's we could look at

2820
00:54:34,370 --> 00:54:34,380
but that's a that's we could look at
 

2821
00:54:34,380 --> 00:54:36,890
but that's a that's we could look at
that as mechanistic right it doesn't it

2822
00:54:36,890 --> 00:54:36,900

00:58:46,500 --> 00:58:47,930
Psychiatry so it's nice to just think
about this a broad umbrella of

why we we have to have checks and

01:01:34,190 --> 01:01:34,200
why we we have to have checks and
 

3197
01:01:34,200 --> 01:01:36,289
why we we have to have checks and
balances right because we don't you know

01:01:36,289 --> 01:01:36,299
balances right because we don't you know
 

3199
01:01:36,299 --> 01:01:38,510
balances right because we don't you know
we we are all inscrutable to ourselves

we we are all inscrutable to ourselves
 

3201
01:01:38,520 --> 01:01:40,970
we we are all inscrutable to ourselves
let alone to others so so we must have

3202
01:01:40,970 --> 01:01:40,980
let alone to others so so we must have
 

3203
01:01:40,980 --> 01:01:42,410
let alone to others so so we must have
checks and balances and we should always

3204
01:01:42,410 --> 01:01:42,420
checks and balances and we should always
 

3205
01:01:42,420 --> 01:01:44,930
checks and balances and we should always
have them on ourselves as well as on

3206
01:01:44,930 --> 01:01:44,940
have them on ourselves as well as on
 

3207
01:01:44,940 --> 01:01:46,609
have them on ourselves as well as on
others we should we should want that for

3208
01:01:46,609 --> 01:01:46,619

Fates too right as we get older but we

3376
01:04:47,270 --> 01:04:47,280
Fates too right as we get older but we
 

3377
01:04:47,280 --> 01:04:49,309
Fates too right as we get older but we
don't you know do that I often think of

3378
01:04:49,309 --> 01:04:49,319
don't you know do that I often think of
 

3379
01:04:49,319 --> 01:04:50,510
don't you know do that I often think of
like in the Olympics you know you see

3380
01:04:50,510 --> 01:04:50,520
like in the Olympics you know you see
 

3381
01:04:50,520 --> 01:04:52,670
like in the Olympics you know you see
like the the great sprinters right and

3382
01:04:52,670 --> 01:04:52,680
like the the great sprinters right and
 

3383
01:04:52,680 --> 01:04:53,690
like the the great sprinters right and
they've got to come out of the blocks

3384
01:04:53,690 --> 01:04:53,700
they've got to come out of the blocks
 

3385
01:04:53,700 --> 01:04:55,130
they've got to come out of the blocks
perfectly right because if they come out

3386
01:04:55,130 --> 01:04:55,140
perfectly right because if they come out
 

3387
01:04:55,140 --> 01:04:56,569
perfectly right because if they come out
of the box a little bit too fast they're

3388
01:04:56,569 --> 01:04:56,579
of the box a little bit too fast they're
 

3389
01:04:56,579 --> 01:04:57,770
of the box a little bit too fast they're
going to fall over right they're going

3390
01:04:57,770 --> 01:04:57,780
going to fall over right they're going
 

3391
01:04:57,780 --> 01:05:00,530
going to fall over right they're going
to just fall forward and and I I often

3392
01:05:00,530 --> 01:05:00,540
to just fall forward and and I I often
 

3393
01:05:00,540 --> 01:05:02,809
to just fall forward and and I I often
just see that in my head about us as you

3394
01:05:02,809 --> 01:05:02,819
just see that in my head about us as you
 

3395
01:05:02,819 --> 01:05:04,609
just see that in my head about us as you
know as humans and as a culture that

3396
01:05:04,609 --> 01:05:04,619
know as humans and as a culture that
 

3397
01:05:04,619 --> 01:05:06,530
know as humans and as a culture that
we're rushing so far forward we don't

3398
01:05:06,530 --> 01:05:06,540
we're rushing so far forward we don't
 

3399
01:05:06,540 --> 01:05:08,329
we're rushing so far forward we don't
stop and say wait let's let's keep the

3400
01:05:08,329 --> 01:05:08,339
stop and say wait let's let's keep the
 

3401
01:05:08,339 --> 01:05:10,730
stop and say wait let's let's keep the
basics here the basic techniques of like

3402
01:05:10,730 --> 01:05:10,740
basics here the basic techniques of like
 

3403
01:05:10,740 --> 01:05:13,609
basics here the basic techniques of like
how are we navigating forward in in Life

3404
01:05:13,609 --> 01:05:13,619
how are we navigating forward in in Life
 

3405
01:05:13,619 --> 01:05:14,870
how are we navigating forward in in Life
or do we just throw all those away

3406
01:05:14,870 --> 01:05:14,880
or do we just throw all those away
 

3407
01:05:14,880 --> 01:05:17,630
or do we just throw all those away
because I can get some benefit by

3408
01:05:17,630 --> 01:05:17,640
because I can get some benefit by
 

3409
01:05:17,640 --> 01:05:19,309
because I can get some benefit by
saying that you're bad even though

3410
01:05:19,309 --> 01:05:19,319
saying that you're bad even though
 

3411
01:05:19,319 --> 01:05:20,569
saying that you're bad even though
what's being leveled against you is

3412
01:05:20,569 --> 01:05:20,579
what's being leveled against you is
 

3413
01:05:20,579 --> 01:05:23,210
what's being leveled against you is
wrong right like what why why do do I

3414
01:05:23,210 --> 01:05:23,220
wrong right like what why why do do I
 

3415
01:05:23,220 --> 01:05:24,950
wrong right like what why why do do I
take that or do I say no that there's

3416
01:05:24,950 --> 01:05:24,960
take that or do I say no that there's
 

3417
01:05:24,960 --> 01:05:26,930
take that or do I say no that there's
something more important here that we

3418
01:05:26,930 --> 01:05:26,940
something more important here that we
 

3419
01:05:26,940 --> 01:05:28,609
something more important here that we
want to Shepherd forward in ourselves as

3420
01:05:28,609 --> 01:05:28,619
want to Shepherd forward in ourselves as
 

3421
01:05:28,619 --> 01:05:30,410
want to Shepherd forward in ourselves as
a culture and I think preventing

3422
01:05:30,410 --> 01:05:30,420
a culture and I think preventing
 

3423
01:05:30,420 --> 01:05:32,750
a culture and I think preventing
childhood trauma and changing the ways

3424
01:05:32,750 --> 01:05:32,760
childhood trauma and changing the ways
 

3425
01:05:32,760 --> 01:05:34,370
childhood trauma and changing the ways
that we educate children and adults

3426
01:05:34,370 --> 01:05:34,380
that we educate children and adults
 

3427
01:05:34,380 --> 01:05:37,370
that we educate children and adults
would could again make a sea change and

3428
01:05:37,370 --> 01:05:37,380
would could again make a sea change and
 

3429
01:05:37,380 --> 01:05:39,770
would could again make a sea change and
maybe set us on a course towards even

3430
01:05:39,770 --> 01:05:39,780
maybe set us on a course towards even
 

3431
01:05:39,780 --> 01:05:41,390
maybe set us on a course towards even
towards a greater likelihood of survival

3432
01:05:41,390 --> 01:05:41,400
towards a greater likelihood of survival
 

3433
01:05:41,400 --> 01:05:45,770
towards a greater likelihood of survival
as a species yeah so talking to like uh

3434
01:05:45,770 --> 01:05:45,780
as a species yeah so talking to like uh
 

3435
01:05:45,780 --> 01:05:48,170
as a species yeah so talking to like uh
people in in elementary school

3436
01:05:48,170 --> 01:05:48,180
people in in elementary school
 

3437
01:05:48,180 --> 01:05:50,390
people in in elementary school
about human nature

3438

about human nature
 

3439
01:05:50,400 --> 01:05:53,990
about human nature
and teaching them was so uh how people

3440
01:05:53,990 --> 01:05:54,000
and teaching them was so uh how people
 

3441
01:05:54,000 --> 01:05:56,990
and teaching them was so uh how people
can be resentful and envious and how how

with such a tragedy wipes that away very
very quickly and then the person feels

very quickly and then the person feels
 

3675
01:10:16,920 --> 01:10:20,050
very quickly and then the person feels
extremely exposed like oh I I thought

01:10:25,560 --> 01:10:27,110
I know that I'm not and then and that
can start to lead to what does that mean

3682
01:10:27,110 --> 01:10:27,120
can start to lead to what does that mean
 

3683
01:10:27,120 --> 01:10:29,990
can start to lead to what does that mean
and now is this all coming for me now

3839
01:13:24,239 --> 01:13:26,270
this is that you know there's an old
psychodynamic concept of what what these

that's what lets us keep the difference
 

3851
01:13:36,900 --> 01:13:40,010
that's what lets us keep the difference
between our feelings right and what we

3852
01:13:40,010 --> 01:13:40,020
between our feelings right and what we
 

3853
01:13:40,020 --> 01:13:41,270
between our feelings right and what we
know to be true like we could be very

Theory which I think initially was a

3980

Theory which I think initially was a
 

3981
01:16:01,080 --> 01:16:04,130

true I'm not sure of this but the idea
was that oh we don't see God's plan

01:17:22,430 --> 01:17:22,440
way I see it because there's a bunch of
 

4057
01:17:22,440 --> 01:17:24,050
way I see it because there's a bunch of
forces

4058
01:17:24,050 --> 01:17:24,060
forces
 

4059
01:17:24,060 --> 01:17:27,050
forces
on uh social media that are trying to

surprise there right that that because

4272
01:21:21,350 --> 01:21:21,360
surprise there right that that because
 

4273
01:21:21,360 --> 01:21:23,330

01:21:28,729 --> 01:21:28,739
for Envy so then yes there will be
 

4279
01:21:28,739 --> 01:21:30,950
for Envy so then yes there will be
people who want to make up lies or

whatever they want to do because you
become a lightning rod for Envy by

4284
01:21:34,790 --> 01:21:34,800
become a lightning rod for Envy by
 

4285
01:21:34,800 --> 01:21:36,470
become a lightning rod for Envy by
having succeeded at the thing you set

4286
01:21:36,470 --> 01:21:36,480
having succeeded at the thing you set
 

4287

then I think that kind of puts it in its

4292
01:21:42,950 --> 01:21:42,960
then I think that kind of puts it in its
 

4293
01:21:42,960 --> 01:21:44,330
then I think that kind of puts it in its
place I mean you're still going to make

4294
01:21:44,330 --> 01:21:44,340
place I mean you're still going to make
 

4295
01:21:44,340 --> 01:21:46,729
place I mean you're still going to make
decisions about it but it makes sense

4296
01:21:46,729 --> 01:21:46,739
decisions about it but it makes sense
 

4297
01:21:46,739 --> 01:21:48,590
decisions about it but it makes sense
then like you you have a mechanism of

4298
01:21:48,590 --> 01:21:48,600
then like you you have a mechanism of
 

4299
01:21:48,600 --> 01:21:51,709
then like you you have a mechanism of
understanding it that not only makes

4300
01:21:51,709 --> 01:21:51,719
understanding it that not only makes
 

4301
01:21:51,719 --> 01:21:54,169
understanding it that not only makes
sense to you but reflects the truth of

4302
01:21:54,169 --> 01:21:54,179
sense to you but reflects the truth of
 

4303
01:21:54,179 --> 01:21:56,630
sense to you but reflects the truth of
what's what you actually have done and

4304
01:21:56,630 --> 01:21:56,640
what's what you actually have done and
 

4305
01:21:56,640 --> 01:21:57,950
what's what you actually have done and
achieved and what's going on in the

4306
01:21:57,950 --> 01:21:57,960
achieved and what's going on in the
 

4307
01:21:57,960 --> 01:22:00,470
achieved and what's going on in the
world around you well I wonder if we're

4308
01:22:00,470 --> 01:22:00,480
world around you well I wonder if we're
 

4309
01:22:00,480 --> 01:22:02,149
world around you well I wonder if we're
all kind of a little bit unique in this

4310
01:22:02,149 --> 01:22:02,159
all kind of a little bit unique in this
 

4311
01:22:02,159 --> 01:22:05,090
all kind of a little bit unique in this
because for me uh I mean maybe it's

4312
01:22:05,090 --> 01:22:05,100
because for me uh I mean maybe it's
 

4313
01:22:05,100 --> 01:22:06,950
because for me uh I mean maybe it's
useful to kind of talk through my own

4314
01:22:06,950 --> 01:22:06,960
useful to kind of talk through my own
 

4315
01:22:06,960 --> 01:22:11,390
useful to kind of talk through my own
experience of it is um for me I try to

4316
01:22:11,390 --> 01:22:11,400
experience of it is um for me I try to
 

4317
01:22:11,400 --> 01:22:13,250
experience of it is um for me I try to
avoid especially in those situations to

4318
01:22:13,250 --> 01:22:13,260
avoid especially in those situations to
 

4319
01:22:13,260 --> 01:22:14,649
avoid especially in those situations to
feel Pride

4320
01:22:14,649 --> 01:22:14,659
feel Pride
 

4321
01:22:14,659 --> 01:22:16,490
feel Pride
because

4322
01:22:16,490 --> 01:22:16,500
because
 

4323
01:22:16,500 --> 01:22:19,310
because
I'm just looking empirically

4324
01:22:19,310 --> 01:22:19,320

alone
 

4379
01:23:16,620 --> 01:23:18,470

interactions

4388
01:23:27,169 --> 01:23:27,179
interactions
 

4389
01:23:27,179 --> 01:23:29,570
interactions
um pride is just a danger I guess it's a

4390
01:23:29,570 --> 01:23:29,580
um pride is just a danger I guess it's a
 

4391
01:23:29,580 --> 01:23:32,209
um pride is just a danger I guess it's a
dangerous drug for me because it like

4392
01:23:32,209 --> 01:23:32,219
dangerous drug for me because it like
 

4393
01:23:32,219 --> 01:23:35,890
dangerous drug for me because it like
it's such a small

4394
01:23:35,890 --> 01:23:35,900
it's such a small
 

4395
01:23:35,900 --> 01:23:39,229
it's such a small
it's a small step away from then losing

4396
01:23:39,229 --> 01:23:39,239
it's a small step away from then losing
 

4397
01:23:39,239 --> 01:23:40,669
it's a small step away from then losing
all the humility and then you start

4398
01:23:40,669 --> 01:23:40,679
all the humility and then you start
 

4399
01:23:40,679 --> 01:23:43,250
all the humility and then you start
getting very defensive and that's not

4400
01:23:43,250 --> 01:23:43,260
getting very defensive and that's not
 

4401
01:23:43,260 --> 01:23:45,649
getting very defensive and that's not
going to that's just it starts you on a

4402
01:23:45,649 --> 01:23:45,659
going to that's just it starts you on a
 

4403
01:23:45,659 --> 01:23:47,570
going to that's just it starts you on a
spiral of negative emotion

4404
01:23:47,570 --> 01:23:47,580
spiral of negative emotion
 

4405
01:23:47,580 --> 01:23:50,330
spiral of negative emotion
um but I also I mean with with everybody

4406
01:23:50,330 --> 01:23:50,340
um but I also I mean with with everybody
 

4407
01:23:50,340 --> 01:23:52,010
um but I also I mean with with everybody
you've mentioned this and will probably

4408
01:23:52,010 --> 01:23:52,020
you've mentioned this and will probably
 

4409
01:23:52,020 --> 01:23:54,890
you've mentioned this and will probably
sneak up to it in different directions

4410
01:23:54,890 --> 01:23:54,900
sneak up to it in different directions
 

4411
01:23:54,900 --> 01:23:57,290
sneak up to it in different directions
um I do think there's different brains

4412
01:23:57,290 --> 01:23:57,300
um I do think there's different brains
 

4413
01:23:57,300 --> 01:24:00,050
um I do think there's different brains
that we all have like my brain is

4414
01:24:00,050 --> 01:24:00,060
that we all have like my brain is
 

4415
01:24:00,060 --> 01:24:02,689
that we all have like my brain is
exceptionally self-critical like

4416
01:24:02,689 --> 01:24:02,699
exceptionally self-critical like
 

4417
01:24:02,699 --> 01:24:05,149
exceptionally self-critical like
non-stop it took of a it's like an

4418
01:24:05,149 --> 01:24:05,159
non-stop it took of a it's like an
 

4419
01:24:05,159 --> 01:24:06,830
non-stop it took of a it's like an
engine that's always there

4420
01:24:06,830 --> 01:24:06,840
engine that's always there
 

4421
01:24:06,840 --> 01:24:09,110
engine that's always there
and um

4422
01:24:09,110 --> 01:24:09,120
and um
 

4423
01:24:09,120 --> 01:24:11,990
and um
but at the same time you're I'm able to

4424
01:24:11,990 --> 01:24:12,000
but at the same time you're I'm able to
 

4425
01:24:12,000 --> 01:24:13,970
but at the same time you're I'm able to
zoom out and have gratitude and it just

4426
01:24:13,970 --> 01:24:13,980
zoom out and have gratitude and it just
 

4427
01:24:13,980 --> 01:24:16,310
zoom out and have gratitude and it just
it's as if there's like two brains and

4428
01:24:16,310 --> 01:24:16,320
it's as if there's like two brains and
 

4429
01:24:16,320 --> 01:24:19,189
it's as if there's like two brains and
they're like cohabitating happily

4430
01:24:19,189 --> 01:24:19,199
they're like cohabitating happily
 

4431
01:24:19,199 --> 01:24:21,470
they're like cohabitating happily
and I can uh the better I get at this

4432
01:24:21,470 --> 01:24:21,480
and I can uh the better I get at this
 

4433
01:24:21,480 --> 01:24:23,090
and I can uh the better I get at this
the more I can use the one that's

4434
01:24:23,090 --> 01:24:23,100
the more I can use the one that's
 

4435
01:24:23,100 --> 01:24:24,590
the more I can use the one that's
self-critical when I'm trying to be

4436
01:24:24,590 --> 01:24:24,600
self-critical when I'm trying to be
 

4437
01:24:24,600 --> 01:24:26,390
self-critical when I'm trying to be
productive because naturally I'm super

4438
01:24:26,390 --> 01:24:26,400
productive because naturally I'm super
 

4439
01:24:26,400 --> 01:24:28,430
productive because naturally I'm super
lazy so I'm trying not to be less lazy

4440
01:24:28,430 --> 01:24:28,440
lazy so I'm trying not to be less lazy
 

4441
01:24:28,440 --> 01:24:32,030
lazy so I'm trying not to be less lazy
I'll be self-critical right and then uh

4442
01:24:32,030 --> 01:24:32,040
I'll be self-critical right and then uh
 

4443
01:24:32,040 --> 01:24:34,610
I'll be self-critical right and then uh
when I'm not being lazy why just there's

4444
01:24:34,610 --> 01:24:34,620
when I'm not being lazy why just there's
 

4445
01:24:34,620 --> 01:24:36,110
when I'm not being lazy why just there's
a special moment I want to enjoy that

4446
01:24:36,110 --> 01:24:36,120
a special moment I want to enjoy that
 

4447
01:24:36,120 --> 01:24:38,209
a special moment I want to enjoy that
moment I'll turn on the Gratitude engine

4448
01:24:38,209 --> 01:24:38,219
moment I'll turn on the Gratitude engine
 

4449
01:24:38,219 --> 01:24:40,130
moment I'll turn on the Gratitude engine
I feel like generic advice that people

4450
01:24:40,130 --> 01:24:40,140
I feel like generic advice that people
 

4451
01:24:40,140 --> 01:24:41,510
I feel like generic advice that people
would give if your brain is

4452
01:24:41,510 --> 01:24:41,520
would give if your brain is
 

4453
01:24:41,520 --> 01:24:43,250
would give if your brain is
self-critical it's not a good thing

4454
01:24:43,250 --> 01:24:43,260
self-critical it's not a good thing
 

4455
01:24:43,260 --> 01:24:44,870
self-critical it's not a good thing
like you should probably get rid of that

4456
01:24:44,870 --> 01:24:44,880
like you should probably get rid of that
 

4457
01:24:44,880 --> 01:24:47,390
like you should probably get rid of that
I don't know about that because it seems

this kind of stuff but I don't know I
 

4487
01:25:19,140 --> 01:25:20,930
this kind of stuff but I don't know I
don't know which one is like because

4488
01:25:20,930 --> 01:25:20,940
don't know which one is like because
 

4489
01:25:20,940 --> 01:25:22,610
don't know which one is like because
you've kind of highlighted it's good to

4490
01:25:22,610 --> 01:25:22,620
you've kind of highlighted it's good to
 

4491
01:25:22,620 --> 01:25:24,350
you've kind of highlighted it's good to
have gratitude and humility but it's

4492
01:25:24,350 --> 01:25:24,360
have gratitude and humility but it's
 

4493
01:25:24,360 --> 01:25:25,610
have gratitude and humility but it's
also good to have a little bit of Pride

4494
01:25:25,610 --> 01:25:25,620
also good to have a little bit of Pride
 

4495
01:25:25,620 --> 01:25:28,130
also good to have a little bit of Pride
I wonder what that like a set of

4496
01:25:28,130 --> 01:25:28,140
I wonder what that like a set of
 

4497
01:25:28,140 --> 01:25:30,350
I wonder what that like a set of
ingredients for healthy what like

4498
01:25:30,350 --> 01:25:30,360
ingredients for healthy what like
 

4499
01:25:30,360 --> 01:25:32,330
ingredients for healthy what like
healthy life looks like for each of us

4500
01:25:32,330 --> 01:25:32,340
healthy life looks like for each of us
 

4501
01:25:32,340 --> 01:25:34,970
healthy life looks like for each of us
whether we have to customize and figure

4502
01:25:34,970 --> 01:25:34,980
whether we have to customize and figure
 

4503
01:25:34,980 --> 01:25:36,649
whether we have to customize and figure
out what that is

4504
01:25:36,649 --> 01:25:36,659
out what that is
 

4505
01:25:36,659 --> 01:25:38,990
out what that is
because some of the cake is already

4506
01:25:38,990 --> 01:25:39,000
because some of the cake is already
 

4507
01:25:39,000 --> 01:25:41,149
because some of the cake is already
baked is the problem and because of the

4508
01:25:41,149 --> 01:25:41,159
baked is the problem and because of the
 

4509
01:25:41,159 --> 01:25:43,250
baked is the problem and because of the
trauma like if I was like eight years

4510
01:25:43,250 --> 01:25:43,260
trauma like if I was like eight years
 

4511
01:25:43,260 --> 01:25:44,510
trauma like if I was like eight years
old maybe I could be a little more

4512
01:25:44,510 --> 01:25:44,520
old maybe I could be a little more
 

4513
01:25:44,520 --> 01:25:47,090
old maybe I could be a little more
flexible but at this point like you got

4514
01:25:47,090 --> 01:25:47,100
flexible but at this point like you got
 

4515
01:25:47,100 --> 01:25:49,310
flexible but at this point like you got
the thing you got and it's hard to like

4516
01:25:49,310 --> 01:25:49,320
the thing you got and it's hard to like
 

4517
01:25:49,320 --> 01:25:51,530
the thing you got and it's hard to like
you can fix a lot with it you could it

4518
01:25:51,530 --> 01:25:51,540
you can fix a lot with it you could it
 

4519
01:25:51,540 --> 01:25:53,810
you can fix a lot with it you could it
may not be easy but there's a lot of

4520
01:25:53,810 --> 01:25:53,820
may not be easy but there's a lot of
 

4521
01:25:53,820 --> 01:25:56,209
may not be easy but there's a lot of
plasticity and a lot of pliability there

4522
01:25:56,209 --> 01:25:56,219
plasticity and a lot of pliability there
 

4523
01:25:56,219 --> 01:25:58,430
plasticity and a lot of pliability there
across all ages

4524
01:25:58,430 --> 01:25:58,440
across all ages
 

4525
01:25:58,440 --> 01:26:00,169
across all ages
again people are different and there may

4526
01:26:00,169 --> 01:26:00,179
again people are different and there may
 

4527
01:26:00,179 --> 01:26:02,450
again people are different and there may
be idiosyncrasies of why one person is

4528
01:26:02,450 --> 01:26:02,460
be idiosyncrasies of why one person is
 

4529
01:26:02,460 --> 01:26:03,950
be idiosyncrasies of why one person is
in a different place but but as a

4530
01:26:03,950 --> 01:26:03,960
in a different place but but as a
 

4531
01:26:03,960 --> 01:26:05,270
in a different place but but as a
general rule I think the answer is

4532
01:26:05,270 --> 01:26:05,280
general rule I think the answer is
 

4533
01:26:05,280 --> 01:26:06,590
general rule I think the answer is
absolutely yes I mean people have

4534
01:26:06,590 --> 01:26:06,600
absolutely yes I mean people have
 

4535
01:26:06,600 --> 01:26:08,570
absolutely yes I mean people have
evolved and I've worked with people

4536
01:26:08,570 --> 01:26:08,580
evolved and I've worked with people
 

4537
01:26:08,580 --> 01:26:10,790
evolved and I've worked with people
who've really changed themselves and

4538
01:26:10,790 --> 01:26:10,800
who've really changed themselves and
 

4539
01:26:10,800 --> 01:26:11,990
who've really changed themselves and
broadened their conception and

4540
01:26:11,990 --> 01:26:12,000
broadened their conception and
 

4541
01:26:12,000 --> 01:26:13,250
broadened their conception and
understanding you know they're in their

4542
01:26:13,250 --> 01:26:13,260
understanding you know they're in their
 

4543
01:26:13,260 --> 01:26:15,470
understanding you know they're in their
80s or you know we I think we can do it

4544
01:26:15,470 --> 01:26:15,480
80s or you know we I think we can do it
 

4545
01:26:15,480 --> 01:26:18,169
80s or you know we I think we can do it
at any stage of life and I would make a

4546
01:26:18,169 --> 01:26:18,179
at any stage of life and I would make a
 

4547
01:26:18,179 --> 01:26:20,030
at any stage of life and I would make a
case for

4548
01:26:20,030 --> 01:26:20,040
case for
 

4549
01:26:20,040 --> 01:26:22,790
case for
for intra-psychic so not between people

4550
01:26:22,790 --> 01:26:22,800
for intra-psychic so not between people
 

4551
01:26:22,800 --> 01:26:25,250
for intra-psychic so not between people
necessarily right but inside of oneself

4552
01:26:25,250 --> 01:26:25,260
necessarily right but inside of oneself
 

4553
01:26:25,260 --> 01:26:27,229
necessarily right but inside of oneself
for the feeling of Pride and maybe if we

4554
01:26:27,229 --> 01:26:27,239
for the feeling of Pride and maybe if we
 

4555
01:26:27,239 --> 01:26:28,550
for the feeling of Pride and maybe if we
call it self-esteem right like let's say

4556
01:26:28,550 --> 01:26:28,560
call it self-esteem right like let's say
 

4557
01:26:28,560 --> 01:26:30,770
call it self-esteem right like let's say
we call it self-esteem right or we could

4558
01:26:30,770 --> 01:26:30,780
we call it self-esteem right or we could
 

4559
01:26:30,780 --> 01:26:32,209
we call it self-esteem right or we could
call it healthy Pride we could put

4560
01:26:32,209 --> 01:26:32,219
call it healthy Pride we could put
 

4561
01:26:32,219 --> 01:26:34,310
call it healthy Pride we could put
either word to it but if you think about

4562
01:26:34,310 --> 01:26:34,320
either word to it but if you think about
 

4563
01:26:34,320 --> 01:26:37,129
either word to it but if you think about
what we're trying to avoid is say a

4564
01:26:37,129 --> 01:26:37,139
what we're trying to avoid is say a
 

4565
01:26:37,139 --> 01:26:40,070
what we're trying to avoid is say a
sense of inadequacy then it is good to

4566
01:26:40,070 --> 01:26:40,080
sense of inadequacy then it is good to
 

4567
01:26:40,080 --> 01:26:41,870
sense of inadequacy then it is good to
sort of own what's ours

4568
01:26:41,870 --> 01:26:41,880
sort of own what's ours
 

4569
01:26:41,880 --> 01:26:44,149
sort of own what's ours
we can put ourselves a little bit out of

4570
01:26:44,149 --> 01:26:44,159
we can put ourselves a little bit out of
 

4571
01:26:44,159 --> 01:26:45,530
we can put ourselves a little bit out of
balance

4572
01:26:45,530 --> 01:26:45,540
balance
 

4573
01:26:45,540 --> 01:26:47,090
balance
um either in terms of building up

4574
01:26:47,090 --> 01:26:47,100
um either in terms of building up
 

4575
01:26:47,100 --> 01:26:49,189
um either in terms of building up
resentments or in terms of decreasing

4576
01:26:49,189 --> 01:26:49,199
resentments or in terms of decreasing
 

4577
01:26:49,199 --> 01:26:51,350
resentments or in terms of decreasing
self-confidence right if we're not

4578
01:26:51,350 --> 01:26:51,360
self-confidence right if we're not
 

4579
01:26:51,360 --> 01:26:54,410
self-confidence right if we're not
owning everything that's ours right so

4580
01:26:54,410 --> 01:26:54,420
owning everything that's ours right so
 

4581
01:26:54,420 --> 01:26:57,649
owning everything that's ours right so
so a thought thought I would have about

4582
01:26:57,649 --> 01:26:57,659
so a thought thought I would have about
 

4583
01:26:57,659 --> 01:26:59,870
so a thought thought I would have about
let's say about some pride or some

4584
01:26:59,870 --> 01:26:59,880
let's say about some pride or some
 

4585
01:26:59,880 --> 01:27:02,510
let's say about some pride or some
self-esteem right is it can work against

4586
01:27:02,510 --> 01:27:02,520
self-esteem right is it can work against
 

4587
01:27:02,520 --> 01:27:04,970
self-esteem right is it can work against
vulnerability right which we know can

4588
01:27:04,970 --> 01:27:04,980
vulnerability right which we know can
 

4589
01:27:04,980 --> 01:27:07,129
vulnerability right which we know can
also in some situations push us towards

4590
01:27:07,129 --> 01:27:07,139
also in some situations push us towards
 

4591
01:27:07,139 --> 01:27:09,590
also in some situations push us towards
jumping the boundary into envy and all

4592
01:27:09,590 --> 01:27:09,600
jumping the boundary into envy and all
 

4593
01:27:09,600 --> 01:27:11,629
jumping the boundary into envy and all
of that so so think about vulnerability

4594
01:27:11,629 --> 01:27:11,639
of that so so think about vulnerability
 

4595
01:27:11,639 --> 01:27:13,189
of that so so think about vulnerability
if

4596
01:27:13,189 --> 01:27:13,199
if
 

4597
01:27:13,199 --> 01:27:16,310
if
you conceive okay people are sailing me

4598
01:27:16,310 --> 01:27:16,320
you conceive okay people are sailing me
 

4599
01:27:16,320 --> 01:27:19,490
you conceive okay people are sailing me
and you just go to a place of gratitude

4600
01:27:19,490 --> 01:27:19,500
and you just go to a place of gratitude
 

4601
01:27:19,500 --> 01:27:22,570
and you just go to a place of gratitude
you know it can it can send a message

4602
01:27:22,570 --> 01:27:22,580
you know it can it can send a message
 

4603
01:27:22,580 --> 01:27:25,910
you know it can it can send a message
that okay I'm just lucky and I hope I

4604
01:27:25,910 --> 01:27:25,920
that okay I'm just lucky and I hope I
 

4605
01:27:25,920 --> 01:27:27,890
that okay I'm just lucky and I hope I
continue to get lucky as opposed to like

4606
01:27:27,890 --> 01:27:27,900
continue to get lucky as opposed to like
 

4607
01:27:27,900 --> 01:27:29,390
continue to get lucky as opposed to like
that's not true right like there's

4608
01:27:29,390 --> 01:27:29,400
that's not true right like there's
 

4609
01:27:29,400 --> 01:27:31,850
that's not true right like there's
there's ability inside of me and

4610
01:27:31,850 --> 01:27:31,860
there's ability inside of me and
 

4611
01:27:31,860 --> 01:27:34,370
there's ability inside of me and
discernment inside of me that tells me I

4612
01:27:34,370 --> 01:27:34,380
discernment inside of me that tells me I
 

4613
01:27:34,380 --> 01:27:36,169
discernment inside of me that tells me I
can have a greater sense of confidence

4614
01:27:36,169 --> 01:27:36,179
can have a greater sense of confidence
 

4615
01:27:36,179 --> 01:27:37,850
can have a greater sense of confidence
that I'll navigate what comes my way

4616
01:27:37,850 --> 01:27:37,860
that I'll navigate what comes my way
 

4617
01:27:37,860 --> 01:27:40,910
that I'll navigate what comes my way
right so because the The Pride or the

4618
01:27:40,910 --> 01:27:40,920
right so because the The Pride or the
 

4619
01:27:40,920 --> 01:27:43,370
right so because the The Pride or the
self-esteem part is owning what we've

4620
01:27:43,370 --> 01:27:43,380
self-esteem part is owning what we've
 

4621
01:27:43,380 --> 01:27:44,990
self-esteem part is owning what we've
contributed to the goodness we've

4622
01:27:44,990 --> 01:27:45,000
contributed to the goodness we've
 

4623
01:27:45,000 --> 01:27:47,510
contributed to the goodness we've
created right which doesn't in a sense

4624
01:27:47,510 --> 01:27:47,520
created right which doesn't in a sense
 

4625
01:27:47,520 --> 01:27:49,970
created right which doesn't in a sense
helps us feel better about ourselves and

4626
01:27:49,970 --> 01:27:49,980
helps us feel better about ourselves and
 

4627
01:27:49,980 --> 01:27:52,610
helps us feel better about ourselves and
it also helps us feel armed against say

4628
01:27:52,610 --> 01:27:52,620
it also helps us feel armed against say
 

4629
01:27:52,620 --> 01:27:54,770
it also helps us feel armed against say
the slings and arrows of you know

the slings and arrows of you know
 

4631

whatever Outrageous Fortune may come
 

4633
01:27:56,580 --> 01:27:58,729
whatever Outrageous Fortune may come
next I don't know I don't know I don't

4634
01:27:58,729 --> 01:27:58,739
next I don't know I don't know I don't

here yes I think that's generally good

4638
01:28:02,689 --> 01:28:02,699
here yes I think that's generally good
 

4639
01:28:02,699 --> 01:28:04,550
here yes I think that's generally good
advice but I I think you mentioned

4640
01:28:04,550 --> 01:28:04,560
advice but I I think you mentioned
 

4641
01:28:04,560 --> 01:28:07,010
advice but I I think you mentioned
vulnerability

4642
01:28:07,010 --> 01:28:07,020
vulnerability
 

4643
01:28:07,020 --> 01:28:09,530
vulnerability
I think it's like uh I've just been

4644
01:28:09,530 --> 01:28:09,540
I think it's like uh I've just been
 

4645
01:28:09,540 --> 01:28:11,149
I think it's like uh I've just been
doing a lot of research on Rocket

4646
01:28:11,149 --> 01:28:11,159
doing a lot of research on Rocket
 

4647
01:28:11,159 --> 01:28:14,689
doing a lot of research on Rocket
engines and Fuel and speaking of fuel I

4648
01:28:14,689 --> 01:28:14,699
engines and Fuel and speaking of fuel I
 

4649
01:28:14,699 --> 01:28:17,209
engines and Fuel and speaking of fuel I
I just think I get a lot from being

4650
01:28:17,209 --> 01:28:17,219
I just think I get a lot from being
 

4651
01:28:17,219 --> 01:28:19,310
I just think I get a lot from being
vulnerable because vulnerable leads to

4652
01:28:19,310 --> 01:28:19,320
vulnerable because vulnerable leads to
 

4653
01:28:19,320 --> 01:28:21,110
vulnerable because vulnerable leads to
Intimacy in friendships and

4654
01:28:21,110 --> 01:28:21,120
Intimacy in friendships and
 

4655
01:28:21,120 --> 01:28:23,149
Intimacy in friendships and
relationships I get a lot from being

4656
01:28:23,149 --> 01:28:23,159
relationships I get a lot from being
 

4657
01:28:23,159 --> 01:28:24,830
relationships I get a lot from being
intimately close with human beings just

4658
01:28:24,830 --> 01:28:24,840
intimately close with human beings just
 

4659
01:28:24,840 --> 01:28:28,370

4663
01:28:31,739 --> 01:28:35,450
level in conversations and so on and so
I would rather err on the side of

4664
01:28:35,450 --> 01:28:35,460
I would rather err on the side of
 

4665
01:28:35,460 --> 01:28:37,790
I would rather err on the side of
vulnerability like to me pride is

4666
01:28:37,790 --> 01:28:37,800
vulnerability like to me pride is
 

4667
01:28:37,800 --> 01:28:42,550
vulnerability like to me pride is
destructive I think I already

4668
01:28:42,550 --> 01:28:42,560

 

4669
01:28:42,560 --> 01:28:44,990

yeah I I already have a pretty good

4670
01:28:44,990 --> 01:28:45,000
yeah I I already have a pretty good
 

4671
01:28:45,000 --> 01:28:47,689
yeah I I already have a pretty good
engine that says like

4672
01:28:47,689 --> 01:28:47,699
engine that says like
 

4673
01:28:47,699 --> 01:28:50,629
engine that says like
life is awesome I don't need help for

4674
01:28:50,629 --> 01:28:50,639
life is awesome I don't need help for
 

4675
01:28:50,639 --> 01:28:53,270
life is awesome I don't need help for
that that's fine that one is working

4676
01:28:53,270 --> 01:28:53,280
that that's fine that one is working
 

4677
01:28:53,280 --> 01:28:56,750
that that's fine that one is working
it's the it's I I just feel like the way

4678

really worried about that like I just it
feels more destructive than anything

4710

feels more destructive than anything
 

4711
01:29:35,820 --> 01:29:37,490
feels more destructive than anything
see what I think as you're telling me

4712
01:29:37,490 --> 01:29:37,500
see what I think as you're telling me
 

4713
01:29:37,500 --> 01:29:39,590
see what I think as you're telling me
that in order to be presumptuous but I

4714
01:29:39,590 --> 01:29:39,600
that in order to be presumptuous but I
 

4715
01:29:39,600 --> 01:29:41,450
that in order to be presumptuous but I
make some thoughts or some conclusions

4716
01:29:41,450 --> 01:29:41,460
make some thoughts or some conclusions
 

4717
01:29:41,460 --> 01:29:43,250
make some thoughts or some conclusions
that tell me hey you're in a pretty

4718
01:29:43,250 --> 01:29:43,260
that tell me hey you're in a pretty
 

4719
01:29:43,260 --> 01:29:45,350
that tell me hey you're in a pretty
healthy place right and the reason I say

4720
01:29:45,350 --> 01:29:45,360
healthy place right and the reason I say
 

4721
01:29:45,360 --> 01:29:47,990
healthy place right and the reason I say
that is because I agree completely about

4722
01:29:47,990 --> 01:29:48,000
that is because I agree completely about
 

4723
01:29:48,000 --> 01:29:49,250
that is because I agree completely about
vulnerability I mean think about

4724
01:29:49,250 --> 01:29:49,260
vulnerability I mean think about
 

4725
01:29:49,260 --> 01:29:51,410
vulnerability I mean think about
humility and gratitude make us

4726
01:29:51,410 --> 01:29:51,420
humility and gratitude make us
 

4727
01:29:51,420 --> 01:29:52,850
humility and gratitude make us
vulnerable right it's like wow I'm

4728
01:29:52,850 --> 01:29:52,860
vulnerable right it's like wow I'm
 

4729
01:29:52,860 --> 01:29:54,410
vulnerable right it's like wow I'm

you know we could get shot down or

4732
01:29:56,149 --> 01:29:56,159
you know we could get shot down or
 

4733
01:29:56,159 --> 01:29:57,290
you know we could get shot down or
something you know something bad could

4734
01:29:57,290 --> 01:29:57,300
something you know something bad could
 

4735
01:29:57,300 --> 01:29:58,790
something you know something bad could
happen and something could make us feel

4736
01:29:58,790 --> 01:29:58,800
happen and something could make us feel
 

4737
01:29:58,800 --> 01:30:01,729
happen and something could make us feel
bad so so yes we we need vulnerability

4738
01:30:01,729 --> 01:30:01,739
bad so so yes we we need vulnerability
 

4739
01:30:01,739 --> 01:30:03,169
bad so so yes we we need vulnerability
if we if we try and eliminate

4740
01:30:03,169 --> 01:30:03,179
if we if we try and eliminate
 

4741
01:30:03,179 --> 01:30:05,689
if we if we try and eliminate
vulnerability we're living miles into

4742
01:30:05,689 --> 01:30:05,699
vulnerability we're living miles into
 

4743
01:30:05,699 --> 01:30:09,229
vulnerability we're living miles into
the envy you know land right so you're

4744
01:30:09,229 --> 01:30:09,239
the envy you know land right so you're
 

4745
01:30:09,239 --> 01:30:11,629
the envy you know land right so you're
describing a healthy vulnerability but

4746
01:30:11,629 --> 01:30:11,639
describing a healthy vulnerability but
 

4747
01:30:11,639 --> 01:30:13,729
describing a healthy vulnerability but
then my brain says that's because on the

4748
01:30:13,729 --> 01:30:13,739
then my brain says that's because on the
 

4749
01:30:13,739 --> 01:30:15,890
then my brain says that's because on the
other side of this the Seesaw so to

4750
01:30:15,890 --> 01:30:15,900
other side of this the Seesaw so to
 

4751
01:30:15,900 --> 01:30:18,530
other side of this the Seesaw so to
speak has to be a healthy sense of self

4752
01:30:18,530 --> 01:30:18,540
speak has to be a healthy sense of self
 

4753
01:30:18,540 --> 01:30:20,570
speak has to be a healthy sense of self
whether we call it self-esteem or

4754
01:30:20,570 --> 01:30:20,580
whether we call it self-esteem or
 

4755
01:30:20,580 --> 01:30:22,910
whether we call it self-esteem or
healthy pride and then I'll cite what I

4756
01:30:22,910 --> 01:30:22,920
healthy pride and then I'll cite what I
 

4757
01:30:22,920 --> 01:30:24,950
healthy pride and then I'll cite what I
think is the evidence for that is you

4758
01:30:24,950 --> 01:30:24,960
think is the evidence for that is you
 

4759
01:30:24,960 --> 01:30:27,410
think is the evidence for that is you
describe the negative voice right as

like the Grumpy Cat right but
that's a good negative voice to have

4764
01:30:32,810 --> 01:30:32,820
that's a good negative voice to have
 

4765
01:30:32,820 --> 01:30:34,790
that's a good negative voice to have
right because it's telling you like hey

01:30:39,600 --> 01:30:41,510
like this you know this there's a
negative voice in some ways but it

4774
01:30:41,510 --> 01:30:41,520

4775
01:30:41,520 --> 01:30:44,390
negative voice in some ways but it
believes in you it's right it's it where

4777
01:30:44,400 --> 01:30:46,370
believes in you it's right it's it where
that voice could be it could be a

4778
01:30:46,370 --> 01:30:46,380
that voice could be it could be a
 

4779
01:30:46,380 --> 01:30:48,649
that voice could be it could be a
negative voice that says you didn't do

4780
01:30:48,649 --> 01:30:48,659
negative voice that says you didn't do
 

4781
01:30:48,659 --> 01:30:50,570
negative voice that says you didn't do
that well because you suck you don't

4782
01:30:50,570 --> 01:30:50,580
that well because you suck you don't
 

4783
01:30:50,580 --> 01:30:53,390
that well because you suck you don't
deserve anything good right why should

4784
01:30:53,390 --> 01:30:53,400
deserve anything good right why should
 

4785
01:30:53,400 --> 01:30:54,770
deserve anything good right why should
you even be alive right I mean like

4786
01:30:54,770 --> 01:30:54,780
you even be alive right I mean like
 

4787
01:30:54,780 --> 01:30:57,229
you even be alive right I mean like
that's the negative voice that you know

4788
01:30:57,229 --> 01:30:57,239
that's the negative voice that you know
 

4789
01:30:57,239 --> 01:30:59,629
that's the negative voice that you know
that can gain so much force if there

4790
01:30:59,629 --> 01:30:59,639
that can gain so much force if there
 

4791
01:30:59,639 --> 01:31:01,310
that can gain so much force if there
isn't a balance of healthy self-esteem

4792
01:31:01,310 --> 01:31:01,320
isn't a balance of healthy self-esteem
 

4793
01:31:01,320 --> 01:31:03,169
isn't a balance of healthy self-esteem
so I think because you're well balanced

4794
01:31:03,169 --> 01:31:03,179
so I think because you're well balanced
 

4795
01:31:03,179 --> 01:31:05,870
so I think because you're well balanced
you know you you have what you need and

4796
01:31:05,870 --> 01:31:05,880
you know you you have what you need and
 

4797
01:31:05,880 --> 01:31:07,370
you know you you have what you need and
then having more of it seems like oh

4798
01:31:07,370 --> 01:31:07,380
then having more of it seems like oh
 

4799
01:31:07,380 --> 01:31:09,169
then having more of it seems like oh
that's not so good but they're people

4800
01:31:09,169 --> 01:31:09,179
that's not so good but they're people
 

4801
01:31:09,179 --> 01:31:11,570
that's not so good but they're people
whose negative voice isn't the grumpy

4802
01:31:11,570 --> 01:31:11,580
whose negative voice isn't the grumpy
 

4803
01:31:11,580 --> 01:31:15,110
whose negative voice isn't the grumpy
CAD it's it's hateful right and then

4804
01:31:15,110 --> 01:31:15,120
CAD it's it's hateful right and then
 

4805
01:31:15,120 --> 01:31:17,870
CAD it's it's hateful right and then
that's a person who needs to to bring

4806
01:31:17,870 --> 01:31:17,880
that's a person who needs to to bring
 

4807
01:31:17,880 --> 01:31:20,510
that's a person who needs to to bring
that into into greater balance yeah I

4808
01:31:20,510 --> 01:31:20,520
that into into greater balance yeah I
 

4809
01:31:20,520 --> 01:31:23,629
that into into greater balance yeah I
think my uh my negative voice is like a

4810
01:31:23,629 --> 01:31:23,639
think my uh my negative voice is like a
 

4811
01:31:23,639 --> 01:31:25,850
think my uh my negative voice is like a
grumpy cat that's like a French

4812
01:31:25,850 --> 01:31:25,860
grumpy cat that's like a French
 

4813
01:31:25,860 --> 01:31:27,709
grumpy cat that's like a French
existentialist maybe a little bit of a

4814
01:31:27,709 --> 01:31:27,719
existentialist maybe a little bit of a
 

4815
01:31:27,719 --> 01:31:32,229
existentialist maybe a little bit of a
nihilist but just kind of is

4816
01:31:32,229 --> 01:31:32,239

 

4817
01:31:32,239 --> 01:31:34,310

it doesn't get hateful it's not like a

4818
01:31:34,310 --> 01:31:34,320
it doesn't get hateful it's not like a
 

4819
01:31:34,320 --> 01:31:36,890
it doesn't get hateful it's not like a
Hitler cat so it's just a little it's a

4820
01:31:36,890 --> 01:31:36,900
Hitler cat so it's just a little it's a
 

4821
01:31:36,900 --> 01:31:37,910
Hitler cat so it's just a little it's a
little more

4822
01:31:37,910 --> 01:31:37,920
little more
 

4823
01:31:37,920 --> 01:31:40,070
little more
um yeah I guess there is kind of like

4824
01:31:40,070 --> 01:31:40,080
um yeah I guess there is kind of like
 

4825
01:31:40,080 --> 01:31:42,169
um yeah I guess there is kind of like
this line that we've come across a

4826
01:31:42,169 --> 01:31:42,179
this line that we've come across a
 

4827
01:31:42,179 --> 01:31:43,910
this line that we've come across a
couple of times between the the benign

4828
01:31:43,910 --> 01:31:43,920
couple of times between the the benign
 

4829
01:31:43,920 --> 01:31:46,669
couple of times between the the benign
and the malignant right but of course

4830
01:31:46,669 --> 01:31:46,679
and the malignant right but of course
 

4831

think existentialists
 

5141
01:37:18,380 --> 01:37:20,689
think existentialists
I don't want to characterize it in the

5142
01:37:20,689 --> 01:37:20,699
I don't want to characterize it in the
 

5143
01:37:20,699 --> 01:37:21,830
I don't want to characterize it in the
wrong way and there's a lot of different

5144
01:37:21,830 --> 01:37:21,840
wrong way and there's a lot of different
 

5145
01:37:21,840 --> 01:37:23,870
wrong way and there's a lot of different
definitions but I think existential is

5146
01:37:23,870 --> 01:37:23,880
definitions but I think existential is
 

5147
01:37:23,880 --> 01:37:25,729
definitions but I think existential is
ultimately

5148
01:37:25,729 --> 01:37:25,739
ultimately
 

5149
01:37:25,739 --> 01:37:29,030
ultimately
do think that there is meaning

5150
01:37:29,030 --> 01:37:29,040
do think that there is meaning
 

5151
01:37:29,040 --> 01:37:30,590
do think that there is meaning
in sort of

5152
01:37:30,590 --> 01:37:30,600
in sort of
 

5153
01:37:30,600 --> 01:37:32,570
in sort of
pursuing The Passion of life like

5154
01:37:32,570 --> 01:37:32,580
pursuing The Passion of life like
 

5155
01:37:32,580 --> 01:37:35,229
pursuing The Passion of life like
pursuing the mo like in living life

5156
01:37:35,229 --> 01:37:35,239
pursuing the mo like in living life
 

5157
01:37:35,239 --> 01:37:37,490
pursuing the mo like in living life
that's where you discover the meaning at

5158
01:37:37,490 --> 01:37:37,500
that's where you discover the meaning at
 

5159
01:37:37,500 --> 01:37:39,250
that's where you discover the meaning at
that individual level

5160
01:37:39,250 --> 01:37:39,260
that individual level
 

5161
01:37:39,260 --> 01:37:42,649
that individual level
of fully embracing life

5162
01:37:42,649 --> 01:37:42,659
of fully embracing life
 

5163
01:37:42,659 --> 01:37:45,590
of fully embracing life
and I think sort of nihilism

5164
01:37:45,590 --> 01:37:45,600
and I think sort of nihilism
 

5165
01:37:45,600 --> 01:37:48,110
and I think sort of nihilism
is uh again it's kind of like a spectrum

5166
01:37:48,110 --> 01:37:48,120
is uh again it's kind of like a spectrum
 

5167
01:37:48,120 --> 01:37:50,510
is uh again it's kind of like a spectrum
but now listen basically says

5168
01:37:50,510 --> 01:37:50,520
but now listen basically says
 

5169
01:37:50,520 --> 01:37:52,970
but now listen basically says
there's no meaning

5170
01:37:52,970 --> 01:37:52,980
there's no meaning
 

5171
01:37:52,980 --> 01:37:55,070
there's no meaning
and it doesn't matter

5172
01:37:55,070 --> 01:37:55,080
and it doesn't matter
 

5173
01:37:55,080 --> 01:37:56,930
and it doesn't matter
nothing matters

5174
01:37:56,930 --> 01:37:56,940
nothing matters
 

5175
01:37:56,940 --> 01:37:59,390
nothing matters
I don't even know but somehow that lands

5176
01:37:59,390 --> 01:37:59,400
I don't even know but somehow that lands
 

5177
01:37:59,400 --> 01:38:02,510
I don't even know but somehow that lands
you in a place that's totally uninspired

5178
01:38:02,510 --> 01:38:02,520
you in a place that's totally uninspired
 

5179
01:38:02,520 --> 01:38:05,090
you in a place that's totally uninspired
maybe not list would disagree with that

5180
01:38:05,090 --> 01:38:05,100
maybe not list would disagree with that
 

5181
01:38:05,100 --> 01:38:07,490
maybe not list would disagree with that
maybe there's a way to live a creative

5182
01:38:07,490 --> 01:38:07,500
maybe there's a way to live a creative
 

5183
01:38:07,500 --> 01:38:10,610
maybe there's a way to live a creative
life in a nihilistic mindset and I think

5184
01:38:10,610 --> 01:38:10,620
life in a nihilistic mindset and I think
 

5185
01:38:10,620 --> 01:38:14,270
life in a nihilistic mindset and I think
of absurdism is somewhere in the middle

5186
01:38:14,270 --> 01:38:14,280
of absurdism is somewhere in the middle
 

5187
01:38:14,280 --> 01:38:16,689
of absurdism is somewhere in the middle
where

5188
01:38:16,689 --> 01:38:16,699
where
 

5189
01:38:16,699 --> 01:38:19,729
where
pursuing meaning at all

5190
01:38:19,729 --> 01:38:19,739
pursuing meaning at all
 

5191
01:38:19,739 --> 01:38:22,250
pursuing meaning at all
is not a good idea

5192
01:38:22,250 --> 01:38:22,260
is not a good idea
 

5193
01:38:22,260 --> 01:38:24,169
is not a good idea
so kind of I think existentials say you

5194
01:38:24,169 --> 01:38:24,179
so kind of I think existentials say you
 

5195
01:38:24,179 --> 01:38:25,910
so kind of I think existentials say you
should be looking for meaning and it's

5196
01:38:25,910 --> 01:38:25,920
should be looking for meaning and it's
 

5197
01:38:25,920 --> 01:38:28,250
should be looking for meaning and it's
to be discovered in your own actions in

5198
01:38:28,250 --> 01:38:28,260
to be discovered in your own actions in
 

5199
01:38:28,260 --> 01:38:31,129
to be discovered in your own actions in
your own life in the moment and uh

5200
01:38:31,129 --> 01:38:31,139
your own life in the moment and uh
 

5201
01:38:31,139 --> 01:38:33,229
your own life in the moment and uh
absurdism says life is absurd nothing

5202
01:38:33,229 --> 01:38:33,239
absurdism says life is absurd nothing
 

5203
01:38:33,239 --> 01:38:35,330
absurdism says life is absurd nothing
makes sense don't look for the meaning

5204
01:38:35,330 --> 01:38:35,340
makes sense don't look for the meaning
 

5205
01:38:35,340 --> 01:38:38,629
makes sense don't look for the meaning
just live just be I think that's kind of

5206
01:38:38,629 --> 01:38:38,639
just live just be I think that's kind of
 

5207
01:38:38,639 --> 01:38:42,530
just live just be I think that's kind of
the the the later kamu kind of

5208
01:38:42,530 --> 01:38:42,540
the the the later kamu kind of
 

5209
01:38:42,540 --> 01:38:43,850
the the the later kamu kind of
um philosophy I don't know if you can

5210
01:38:43,850 --> 01:38:43,860
um philosophy I don't know if you can
 

5211
01:38:43,860 --> 01:38:46,430
um philosophy I don't know if you can
sort of comment on these kind of nuanced

5212
01:38:46,430 --> 01:38:46,440
sort of comment on these kind of nuanced
 

5213
01:38:46,440 --> 01:38:49,390
sort of comment on these kind of nuanced
ideas here if there is no

5214
01:38:49,390 --> 01:38:49,400
ideas here if there is no
 

5215
01:38:49,400 --> 01:38:53,530
ideas here if there is no
religious guide to your life

5216
01:38:53,530 --> 01:38:53,540
religious guide to your life
 

5217
01:38:53,540 --> 01:38:55,550
religious guide to your life
what do you think about this kind of

5218
01:38:55,550 --> 01:38:55,560
what do you think about this kind of
 

5219
01:38:55,560 --> 01:38:57,709
what do you think about this kind of
search for meaning do you see that

5220
01:38:57,709 --> 01:38:57,719
search for meaning do you see that
 

5221
01:38:57,719 --> 01:38:58,850
search for meaning do you see that
there's some wisdom in the

5222
01:38:58,850 --> 01:38:58,860
there's some wisdom in the
 

5223
01:38:58,860 --> 01:39:00,229
there's some wisdom in the
existentialist perspective of

5224
01:39:00,229 --> 01:39:00,239
existentialist perspective of
 

5225
01:39:00,239 --> 01:39:03,350
existentialist perspective of
discovering it in your own life in this

5226
01:39:03,350 --> 01:39:03,360
discovering it in your own life in this
 

5227
01:39:03,360 --> 01:39:05,570
discovering it in your own life in this
passion and this kind of day-to-day

5228
01:39:05,570 --> 01:39:05,580
passion and this kind of day-to-day
 

5229
01:39:05,580 --> 01:39:07,310
passion and this kind of day-to-day
existence in the moments of your life

5230
01:39:07,310 --> 01:39:07,320
existence in the moments of your life
 

5231
01:39:07,320 --> 01:39:08,689
existence in the moments of your life
that bring you Joy that kind of thing

5232
01:39:08,689 --> 01:39:08,699
that bring you Joy that kind of thing
 

5233
01:39:08,699 --> 01:39:10,370
that bring you Joy that kind of thing
you're bringing different sort of

5234
01:39:10,370 --> 01:39:10,380
you're bringing different sort of
 

5235
01:39:10,380 --> 01:39:11,750
you're bringing different sort of
perspectives and trying to tease apart

5236
01:39:11,750 --> 01:39:11,760
perspectives and trying to tease apart
 

5237
01:39:11,760 --> 01:39:13,490
perspectives and trying to tease apart
like wait what are the differences in

5238
01:39:13,490 --> 01:39:13,500
like wait what are the differences in
 

5239
01:39:13,500 --> 01:39:14,990
like wait what are the differences in
those perspectives right and I think

5240
01:39:14,990 --> 01:39:15,000
those perspectives right and I think
 

5241
01:39:15,000 --> 01:39:16,910
those perspectives right and I think
what it points out is that

5242
01:39:16,910 --> 01:39:16,920
what it points out is that
 

5243
01:39:16,920 --> 01:39:19,189
what it points out is that
okay we tend to conflate things as human

5244
01:39:19,189 --> 01:39:19,199
okay we tend to conflate things as human
 

5245
01:39:19,199 --> 01:39:20,930
okay we tend to conflate things as human
beings right and to take two different

5246
01:39:20,930 --> 01:39:20,940
beings right and to take two different
 

5247
01:39:20,940 --> 01:39:22,430
beings right and to take two different
things and try and make them into one

5248
01:39:22,430 --> 01:39:22,440
things and try and make them into one
 

5249
01:39:22,440 --> 01:39:24,530
things and try and make them into one
but we also I think on the other end of

5250
01:39:24,530 --> 01:39:24,540
but we also I think on the other end of
 

5251
01:39:24,540 --> 01:39:25,850
but we also I think on the other end of
the spectrum get very overly

5252
01:39:25,850 --> 01:39:25,860
the spectrum get very overly
 

5253
01:39:25,860 --> 01:39:28,250
the spectrum get very overly
reductionist and I think that when we

5254
01:39:28,250 --> 01:39:28,260
reductionist and I think that when we
 

5255
01:39:28,260 --> 01:39:31,189
reductionist and I think that when we
get to overly reductionist we lose the

5256
01:39:31,189 --> 01:39:31,199
get to overly reductionist we lose the
 

5257
01:39:31,199 --> 01:39:32,750
get to overly reductionist we lose the
ability to learn from anything or to

5258
01:39:32,750 --> 01:39:32,760
ability to learn from anything or to
 

5259
01:39:32,760 --> 01:39:33,950
ability to learn from anything or to
generate meaning right I mean think

5260
01:39:33,950 --> 01:39:33,960
generate meaning right I mean think
 

5261
01:39:33,960 --> 01:39:36,290
generate meaning right I mean think
about Sartre who is you know the thought

5262
01:39:36,290 --> 01:39:36,300
about Sartre who is you know the thought
 

5263
01:39:36,300 --> 01:39:38,330
about Sartre who is you know the thought
of existentialism is so consistent with

5264
01:39:38,330 --> 01:39:38,340
of existentialism is so consistent with
 

5265
01:39:38,340 --> 01:39:40,970
of existentialism is so consistent with
him right who on the one hand you know

5266
01:39:40,970 --> 01:39:40,980
him right who on the one hand you know
 

5267
01:39:40,980 --> 01:39:43,189
him right who on the one hand you know
wrote about you know very clear terms

5268
01:39:43,189 --> 01:39:43,199
wrote about you know very clear terms
 

5269
01:39:43,199 --> 01:39:44,390
wrote about you know very clear terms
like this is what it is and this is what

5270
01:39:44,390 --> 01:39:44,400
like this is what it is and this is what
 

5271
01:39:44,400 --> 01:39:45,470
like this is what it is and this is what
it isn't and here's how you're going to

5272
01:39:45,470 --> 01:39:45,480
it isn't and here's how you're going to
 

5273
01:39:45,480 --> 01:39:46,669
it isn't and here's how you're going to
make your meaning in a very like

5274
01:39:46,669 --> 01:39:46,679
make your meaning in a very like
 

5275
01:39:46,679 --> 01:39:49,729
make your meaning in a very like
academically pro-scribed way but he also

5276
01:39:49,729 --> 01:39:49,739
academically pro-scribed way but he also
 

5277
01:39:49,739 --> 01:39:52,310
academically pro-scribed way but he also
wrote short stories like the wall right

5278
01:39:52,310 --> 01:39:52,320
wrote short stories like the wall right
 

5279
01:39:52,320 --> 01:39:54,169
wrote short stories like the wall right
where there's something totally absurd

5280
01:39:54,169 --> 01:39:54,179
where there's something totally absurd
 

5281
01:39:54,179 --> 01:39:56,209
where there's something totally absurd
happens right as part of the story right

5282
01:39:56,209 --> 01:39:56,219
happens right as part of the story right
 

5283
01:39:56,219 --> 01:39:58,970
happens right as part of the story right
so I I think what ends up happening is

5284
01:39:58,970 --> 01:39:58,980
so I I think what ends up happening is
 

5285
01:39:58,980 --> 01:40:00,649
so I I think what ends up happening is
people either reduce themselves or get

5286
01:40:00,649 --> 01:40:00,659
people either reduce themselves or get
 

5287
01:40:00,659 --> 01:40:03,110
people either reduce themselves or get
associated with something that is by

5288
01:40:03,110 --> 01:40:03,120
associated with something that is by
 

5289
01:40:03,120 --> 01:40:04,850
associated with something that is by
being overly reductionist takes us away

5290
01:40:04,850 --> 01:40:04,860
being overly reductionist takes us away
 

5291
01:40:04,860 --> 01:40:07,610
being overly reductionist takes us away
from meaning right the idea that look we

5292
01:40:07,610 --> 01:40:07,620
from meaning right the idea that look we
 

5293
01:40:07,620 --> 01:40:11,510
from meaning right the idea that look we
don't know if there is a an overarching

5294
01:40:11,510 --> 01:40:11,520
don't know if there is a an overarching
 

5295
01:40:11,520 --> 01:40:13,189
don't know if there is a an overarching
religious meaning or you know what we

5296
01:40:13,189 --> 01:40:13,199
religious meaning or you know what we
 

5297
01:40:13,199 --> 01:40:14,930
religious meaning or you know what we
call a religious meaning or purpose like

5298
01:40:14,930 --> 01:40:14,940
call a religious meaning or purpose like
 

5299
01:40:14,940 --> 01:40:16,850
call a religious meaning or purpose like
we don't know that right

5300
01:40:16,850 --> 01:40:16,860
we don't know that right
 

5301
01:40:16,860 --> 01:40:19,129
we don't know that right
so okay if we take that as a given that

5302
01:40:19,129 --> 01:40:19,139
so okay if we take that as a given that
 

5303
01:40:19,139 --> 01:40:21,169
so okay if we take that as a given that
people who say that they know are having

5304
01:40:21,169 --> 01:40:21,179
people who say that they know are having
 

5305
01:40:21,179 --> 01:40:23,090
people who say that they know are having
faith like how Spinoza described Faith

5306
01:40:23,090 --> 01:40:23,100
faith like how Spinoza described Faith
 

5307
01:40:23,100 --> 01:40:25,310
faith like how Spinoza described Faith
right faith is that you don't know but

5308
01:40:25,310 --> 01:40:25,320
right faith is that you don't know but
 

5309
01:40:25,320 --> 01:40:27,950
right faith is that you don't know but
you believe anyway right it's not

5310
01:40:27,950 --> 01:40:27,960
you believe anyway right it's not
 

5311
01:40:27,960 --> 01:40:29,990
you believe anyway right it's not
because you have faith now you know

5312
01:40:29,990 --> 01:40:30,000
because you have faith now you know
 

5313
01:40:30,000 --> 01:40:32,209
because you have faith now you know
something right because I think that's a

5314
01:40:32,209 --> 01:40:32,219
something right because I think that's a
 

5315
01:40:32,219 --> 01:40:34,189
something right because I think that's a
slippery slope to the persecution of

5316
01:40:34,189 --> 01:40:34,199
slippery slope to the persecution of
 

5317
01:40:34,199 --> 01:40:37,189
slippery slope to the persecution of
others right so so if we say okay we

5318
01:40:37,189 --> 01:40:37,199
others right so so if we say okay we
 

5319
01:40:37,199 --> 01:40:38,330
others right so so if we say okay we
don't know

5320
01:40:38,330 --> 01:40:38,340
don't know
 

5321
01:40:38,340 --> 01:40:39,590
don't know
then

5322
01:40:39,590 --> 01:40:39,600
then
 

5323
01:40:39,600 --> 01:40:41,689
then
you know we're left either deciding okay

5324
01:40:41,689 --> 01:40:41,699
you know we're left either deciding okay
 

5325
01:40:41,699 --> 01:40:43,610
you know we're left either deciding okay
well then the hell with everything you

5326
01:40:43,610 --> 01:40:43,620
well then the hell with everything you
 

5327
01:40:43,620 --> 01:40:45,830
well then the hell with everything you
know like is that movie A Strange Brew

5328
01:40:45,830 --> 01:40:45,840
know like is that movie A Strange Brew
 

5329
01:40:45,840 --> 01:40:47,810
know like is that movie A Strange Brew
right Bob and Doug McKenzie where like

5330
01:40:47,810 --> 01:40:47,820
right Bob and Doug McKenzie where like
 

5331
01:40:47,820 --> 01:40:49,790
right Bob and Doug McKenzie where like
the the breaks don't work on the car and

5332
01:40:49,790 --> 01:40:49,800
the the breaks don't work on the car and
 

5333
01:40:49,800 --> 01:40:51,530
the the breaks don't work on the car and
one of them says oh why bother steering

5334
01:40:51,530 --> 01:40:51,540
one of them says oh why bother steering
 

5335
01:40:51,540 --> 01:40:53,330
one of them says oh why bother steering
right so if we don't know that there's

5336
01:40:53,330 --> 01:40:53,340
right so if we don't know that there's
 

5337
01:40:53,340 --> 01:40:54,709
right so if we don't know that there's
meaning like why bother stealing let's

5338
01:40:54,709 --> 01:40:54,719
meaning like why bother stealing let's
 

5339
01:40:54,719 --> 01:40:56,450
meaning like why bother stealing let's
just give up the ghost right and I don't

5340
01:40:56,450 --> 01:40:56,460
just give up the ghost right and I don't
 

5341
01:40:56,460 --> 01:40:58,189
just give up the ghost right and I don't
think that's even what the nihilist said

5342
01:40:58,189 --> 01:40:58,199
think that's even what the nihilist said
 

5343
01:40:58,199 --> 01:41:00,229
think that's even what the nihilist said
I mean I think the coonan said we should

5344
01:41:00,229 --> 01:41:00,239
I mean I think the coonan said we should
 

5345
01:41:00,239 --> 01:41:02,270
I mean I think the coonan said we should
get rid of everything that we've ever

5346
01:41:02,270 --> 01:41:02,280
get rid of everything that we've ever
 

5347
01:41:02,280 --> 01:41:04,129
get rid of everything that we've ever
created except Beethoven's Ninth

5348
01:41:04,129 --> 01:41:04,139
created except Beethoven's Ninth
 

5349
01:41:04,139 --> 01:41:06,350
created except Beethoven's Ninth
Symphony and start over from there but

5350
01:41:06,350 --> 01:41:06,360
Symphony and start over from there but
 

5351
01:41:06,360 --> 01:41:08,390
Symphony and start over from there but
so even people who are very nihilistic

5352
01:41:08,390 --> 01:41:08,400
so even people who are very nihilistic
 

5353
01:41:08,400 --> 01:41:10,430
so even people who are very nihilistic
or associated with that yeah a lot of

5354
01:41:10,430 --> 01:41:10,440
or associated with that yeah a lot of
 

5355
01:41:10,440 --> 01:41:11,870
or associated with that yeah a lot of
them are just not liking what we had

5356
01:41:11,870 --> 01:41:11,880
them are just not liking what we had
 

5357
01:41:11,880 --> 01:41:14,510
them are just not liking what we had
built right so if we accept that a lot

5358
01:41:14,510 --> 01:41:14,520
built right so if we accept that a lot
 

5359
01:41:14,520 --> 01:41:16,729
built right so if we accept that a lot
of what we have built as humans inside

5360
01:41:16,729 --> 01:41:16,739
of what we have built as humans inside
 

5361
01:41:16,739 --> 01:41:18,110
of what we have built as humans inside
of us and outside of us is really

5362
01:41:18,110 --> 01:41:18,120
of us and outside of us is really
 

5363
01:41:18,120 --> 01:41:19,729
of us and outside of us is really
counterproductive and doesn't help us

5364
01:41:19,729 --> 01:41:19,739
counterproductive and doesn't help us
 

5365
01:41:19,739 --> 01:41:22,669
counterproductive and doesn't help us
and that absurd things happen in the

5366
01:41:22,669 --> 01:41:22,679
and that absurd things happen in the
 

5367
01:41:22,679 --> 01:41:23,990
and that absurd things happen in the
world right and that often the way

5368
01:41:23,990 --> 01:41:24,000
world right and that often the way
 

5369
01:41:24,000 --> 01:41:26,030
world right and that often the way
social structures and systems build up

5370
01:41:26,030 --> 01:41:26,040
social structures and systems build up
 

5371
01:41:26,040 --> 01:41:28,189
social structures and systems build up
you build themselves up is absurd I

5372
01:41:28,189 --> 01:41:28,199
you build themselves up is absurd I
 

5373
01:41:28,199 --> 01:41:30,290
you build themselves up is absurd I
think our health care System operates in

5374
01:41:30,290 --> 01:41:30,300
think our health care System operates in
 

5375
01:41:30,300 --> 01:41:32,689
think our health care System operates in
a way that's absurd right so if we

5376
01:41:32,689 --> 01:41:32,699
a way that's absurd right so if we
 

5377
01:41:32,699 --> 01:41:34,729
a way that's absurd right so if we
accept that there are absurdities that

5378
01:41:34,729 --> 01:41:34,739
accept that there are absurdities that
 

5379
01:41:34,739 --> 01:41:37,070
accept that there are absurdities that
we don't know if there's truth then what

5380
01:41:37,070 --> 01:41:37,080
we don't know if there's truth then what
 

5381
01:41:37,080 --> 01:41:38,870
we don't know if there's truth then what
are we left with but like well let's try

5382
01:41:38,870 --> 01:41:38,880
are we left with but like well let's try
 

5383
01:41:38,880 --> 01:41:41,570
are we left with but like well let's try
and make meaning right or take it you

5384
01:41:41,570 --> 01:41:41,580
and make meaning right or take it you
 

5385
01:41:41,580 --> 01:41:44,030
and make meaning right or take it you
got set said um yoso yo Amy

5386
01:41:44,030 --> 01:41:44,040
got set said um yoso yo Amy
 

5387
01:41:44,040 --> 01:41:46,010
got set said um yoso yo Amy
circumstancia right I myself and my

5388
01:41:46,010 --> 01:41:46,020
circumstancia right I myself and my
 

5389
01:41:46,020 --> 01:41:47,450
circumstancia right I myself and my
circumstances right which is like look

5390
01:41:47,450 --> 01:41:47,460
circumstances right which is like look
 

5391
01:41:47,460 --> 01:41:49,070
circumstances right which is like look
we're we're we can't control everything

5392
01:41:49,070 --> 01:41:49,080
we're we're we can't control everything
 

5393
01:41:49,080 --> 01:41:51,530
we're we're we can't control everything
we we live in circumstances around us

5394
01:41:51,530 --> 01:41:51,540
we we live in circumstances around us
 

5395
01:41:51,540 --> 01:41:54,830
we we live in circumstances around us
but within those circumstances we can

5396
01:41:54,830 --> 01:41:54,840
but within those circumstances we can
 

5397
01:41:54,840 --> 01:41:58,250
but within those circumstances we can
make decisions and Define ourselves and

5398
01:41:58,250 --> 01:41:58,260
make decisions and Define ourselves and
 

5399
01:41:58,260 --> 01:41:59,990
make decisions and Define ourselves and
and I think the Brilliance of that and I

5400
01:41:59,990 --> 01:42:00,000
and I think the Brilliance of that and I
 

5401
01:42:00,000 --> 01:42:02,209
and I think the Brilliance of that and I
think tying it all together right in a

5402
01:42:02,209 --> 01:42:02,219
think tying it all together right in a
 

5403
01:42:02,219 --> 01:42:04,430
think tying it all together right in a
way that's not trying to be in a sense

5404
01:42:04,430 --> 01:42:04,440
way that's not trying to be in a sense
 

5405
01:42:04,440 --> 01:42:07,010
way that's not trying to be in a sense
it ties it all together by not trying to

5406
01:42:07,010 --> 01:42:07,020
it ties it all together by not trying to
 

5407
01:42:07,020 --> 01:42:09,229
it ties it all together by not trying to
answer everything concisely that yes we

5408
01:42:09,229 --> 01:42:09,239
answer everything concisely that yes we
 

5409
01:42:09,239 --> 01:42:10,910
answer everything concisely that yes we
can make meaning like we see that if

5410
01:42:10,910 --> 01:42:10,920
can make meaning like we see that if
 

5411
01:42:10,920 --> 01:42:12,890
can make meaning like we see that if
someone trips in front of me I could

5412
01:42:12,890 --> 01:42:12,900
someone trips in front of me I could
 

5413
01:42:12,900 --> 01:42:14,390
someone trips in front of me I could
walk around them or I could help them up

5414
01:42:14,390 --> 01:42:14,400
walk around them or I could help them up
 

5415
01:42:14,400 --> 01:42:16,129
walk around them or I could help them up
I mean no one can tell me that it

5416
01:42:16,129 --> 01:42:16,139
I mean no one can tell me that it
 

5417
01:42:16,139 --> 01:42:18,770
I mean no one can tell me that it
doesn't matter what I do I absolutely

5418
01:42:18,770 --> 01:42:18,780
doesn't matter what I do I absolutely
 

5419
01:42:18,780 --> 01:42:20,629
doesn't matter what I do I absolutely
reject the idea that oh I could step

5420
01:42:20,629 --> 01:42:20,639
reject the idea that oh I could step
 

5421
01:42:20,639 --> 01:42:22,910
reject the idea that oh I could step
over them or on them or I could help

5422
01:42:22,910 --> 01:42:22,920
over them or on them or I could help
 

5423
01:42:22,920 --> 01:42:24,709
over them or on them or I could help
them up and it doesn't matter oh yeah be

5424
01:42:24,709 --> 01:42:24,719
them up and it doesn't matter oh yeah be
 

5425
01:42:24,719 --> 01:42:26,149
them up and it doesn't matter oh yeah be
the try being the person on the ground

5426
01:42:26,149 --> 01:42:26,159
the try being the person on the ground
 

5427
01:42:26,159 --> 01:42:30,410
the try being the person on the ground
right so we create meaning but we live

5428
01:42:30,410 --> 01:42:30,420
right so we create meaning but we live
 

5429
01:42:30,420 --> 01:42:32,510
right so we create meaning but we live
in our circumstances and there are

5430
01:42:32,510 --> 01:42:32,520
in our circumstances and there are
 

5431
01:42:32,520 --> 01:42:34,609
in our circumstances and there are
absurdities both within us and outside

5432
01:42:34,609 --> 01:42:34,619
absurdities both within us and outside
 

5433
01:42:34,619 --> 01:42:36,830
absurdities both within us and outside
of us in our social structures and there

5434
01:42:36,830 --> 01:42:36,840
of us in our social structures and there
 

5435
01:42:36,840 --> 01:42:38,870
of us in our social structures and there
are a lot of things that that pretend to

5436
01:42:38,870 --> 01:42:38,880
are a lot of things that that pretend to
 

5437
01:42:38,880 --> 01:42:41,209
are a lot of things that that pretend to
have meaning that don't then there's the

5438
01:42:41,209 --> 01:42:41,219
have meaning that don't then there's the
 

5439
01:42:41,219 --> 01:42:42,770
have meaning that don't then there's the
shades of nihilism But ultimately

5440
01:42:42,770 --> 01:42:42,780
shades of nihilism But ultimately
 

5441
01:42:42,780 --> 01:42:44,570
shades of nihilism But ultimately
there's something going on here that's

5442
01:42:44,570 --> 01:42:44,580
there's something going on here that's
 

5443
01:42:44,580 --> 01:42:46,490
there's something going on here that's
doing the best we can in the context of

5444
01:42:46,490 --> 01:42:46,500
doing the best we can in the context of
 

5445
01:42:46,500 --> 01:42:48,350
doing the best we can in the context of
just not knowing

5446
01:42:48,350 --> 01:42:48,360
just not knowing
 

5447
01:42:48,360 --> 01:42:50,149
just not knowing
yeah I tend to see I don't know if it's

5448
01:42:50,149 --> 01:42:50,159
yeah I tend to see I don't know if it's
 

5449
01:42:50,159 --> 01:42:52,550
yeah I tend to see I don't know if it's
genetic I think I tend to think just

5450
01:42:52,550 --> 01:42:52,560
genetic I think I tend to think just
 

5451
01:42:52,560 --> 01:42:54,350
genetic I think I tend to think just
observing the internet the number of

5452
01:42:54,350 --> 01:42:54,360
observing the internet the number of
 

5453
01:42:54,360 --> 01:42:56,689
observing the internet the number of
memes there are uh

5454
01:42:56,689 --> 01:42:56,699
memes there are uh
 

5455
01:42:56,699 --> 01:42:59,149
memes there are uh
I think many other people are like me I

5456
01:42:59,149 --> 01:42:59,159
I think many other people are like me I
 

5457
01:42:59,159 --> 01:43:00,709
I think many other people are like me I
tend to see the the humor in the

5458
01:43:00,709 --> 01:43:00,719
tend to see the the humor in the
 

5459
01:43:00,719 --> 01:43:01,729
tend to see the the humor in the
absurdity

5460
01:43:01,729 --> 01:43:01,739
absurdity
 

5461
01:43:01,739 --> 01:43:03,530
absurdity
and I tend to enjoy it from that kind of

5462
01:43:03,530 --> 01:43:03,540
and I tend to enjoy it from that kind of
 

5463
01:43:03,540 --> 01:43:05,810
and I tend to enjoy it from that kind of
angle I see the kafka-esque nature of

5464
01:43:05,810 --> 01:43:05,820
angle I see the kafka-esque nature of
 

5465
01:43:05,820 --> 01:43:07,550
angle I see the kafka-esque nature of
society of different aspects of society

5466
01:43:07,550 --> 01:43:07,560
society of different aspects of society
 

5467
01:43:07,560 --> 01:43:10,850
society of different aspects of society
and just kind of notice the magic with a

5468
01:43:10,850 --> 01:43:10,860
and just kind of notice the magic with a
 

5469
01:43:10,860 --> 01:43:12,189
and just kind of notice the magic with a
smile

5470
01:43:12,189 --> 01:43:12,199
smile
 

5471
01:43:12,199 --> 01:43:15,290
smile
and just laugh at the circus of it all

5472
01:43:15,290 --> 01:43:15,300
and just laugh at the circus of it all
 

5473
01:43:15,300 --> 01:43:17,570
and just laugh at the circus of it all
because it is magical that the circus

5474
01:43:17,570 --> 01:43:17,580
because it is magical that the circus
 

5475
01:43:17,580 --> 01:43:19,550
because it is magical that the circus
all comes together it's like a little

5476
01:43:19,550 --> 01:43:19,560
all comes together it's like a little
 

5477
01:43:19,560 --> 01:43:21,709
all comes together it's like a little
bit out of sync and then just a guy

5478
01:43:21,709 --> 01:43:21,719
bit out of sync and then just a guy
 

5479
01:43:21,719 --> 01:43:23,570
bit out of sync and then just a guy
playing trombone but like overall it's

5480
01:43:23,570 --> 01:43:23,580
playing trombone but like overall it's
 

5481
01:43:23,580 --> 01:43:25,609
playing trombone but like overall it's
pretty good it's pretty good right and

5482
01:43:25,609 --> 01:43:25,619
pretty good it's pretty good right and
 

5483
01:43:25,619 --> 01:43:26,810
pretty good it's pretty good right and
we can look at that and just kind of

5484
01:43:26,810 --> 01:43:26,820
we can look at that and just kind of
 

5485
01:43:26,820 --> 01:43:29,209
we can look at that and just kind of
Marvel and go yeah right which which I

5486
01:43:29,209 --> 01:43:29,219
Marvel and go yeah right which which I
 

5487
01:43:29,219 --> 01:43:31,490
Marvel and go yeah right which which I
think is a relation to at least a lot of

5488
01:43:31,490 --> 01:43:31,500
think is a relation to at least a lot of
 

5489
01:43:31,500 --> 01:43:34,129
think is a relation to at least a lot of
what we in the Western World think of as

5490
01:43:34,129 --> 01:43:34,139
what we in the Western World think of as
 

5491
01:43:34,139 --> 01:43:35,149
what we in the Western World think of as
Eastern right it's like as

5492
01:43:35,149 --> 01:43:35,159
Eastern right it's like as
 

5493
01:43:35,159 --> 01:43:37,070
Eastern right it's like as
non-attachment right because then if

5494
01:43:37,070 --> 01:43:37,080
non-attachment right because then if
 

5495
01:43:37,080 --> 01:43:39,169
non-attachment right because then if
there's something absurd and it's like

5496
01:43:39,169 --> 01:43:39,179
there's something absurd and it's like
 

5497
01:43:39,179 --> 01:43:41,810
there's something absurd and it's like
not good for me you know right then I

5498
01:43:41,810 --> 01:43:41,820
not good for me you know right then I
 

5499
01:43:41,820 --> 01:43:43,669
not good for me you know right then I
accept that too instead of getting angry

5500
01:43:43,669 --> 01:43:43,679
accept that too instead of getting angry
 

5501
01:43:43,679 --> 01:43:45,350
accept that too instead of getting angry
about it and railing about it or seeing

5502
01:43:45,350 --> 01:43:45,360
about it and railing about it or seeing
 

5503
01:43:45,360 --> 01:43:47,510
about it and railing about it or seeing
some Cosmic meaning in it right I think

5504
01:43:47,510 --> 01:43:47,520
some Cosmic meaning in it right I think
 

5505
01:43:47,520 --> 01:43:49,310
some Cosmic meaning in it right I think
there's also a healthy non-attachment in

5506
01:43:49,310 --> 01:43:49,320
there's also a healthy non-attachment in
 

5507
01:43:49,320 --> 01:43:51,830
there's also a healthy non-attachment in
what you're saying too so there's uh I

5508
01:43:51,830 --> 01:43:51,840
what you're saying too so there's uh I
 

5509
01:43:51,840 --> 01:43:53,330
what you're saying too so there's uh I
mean you mentioned Eastern thought

5510
01:43:53,330 --> 01:43:53,340
mean you mentioned Eastern thought
 

5511
01:43:53,340 --> 01:43:55,030
mean you mentioned Eastern thought
there's uh

5512
01:43:55,030 --> 01:43:55,040
there's uh
 

5513
01:43:55,040 --> 01:43:58,850
there's uh
but also Buddha have kind of uh spoke of

5514
01:43:58,850 --> 01:43:58,860
but also Buddha have kind of uh spoke of
 

5515
01:43:58,860 --> 01:44:00,890
but also Buddha have kind of uh spoke of
life is suffering uh do you think

5516
01:44:00,890 --> 01:44:00,900
life is suffering uh do you think
 

5517
01:44:00,900 --> 01:44:02,870
life is suffering uh do you think
there's truth to that that suffering is

5518
01:44:02,870 --> 01:44:02,880
there's truth to that that suffering is
 

5519
01:44:02,880 --> 01:44:05,870
there's truth to that that suffering is
a is a fundamental part of life

5520
01:44:05,870 --> 01:44:05,880
a is a fundamental part of life
 

5521
01:44:05,880 --> 01:44:08,149
a is a fundamental part of life
I think it is a fundamental part of life

5522
01:44:08,149 --> 01:44:08,159
I think it is a fundamental part of life
 

5523
01:44:08,159 --> 01:44:10,790
I think it is a fundamental part of life
I don't think that means that life is

5524
01:44:10,790 --> 01:44:10,800
I don't think that means that life is
 

5525
01:44:10,800 --> 01:44:12,770
I don't think that means that life is
suffering right if we say well life is

5526
01:44:12,770 --> 01:44:12,780
suffering right if we say well life is
 

5527
01:44:12,780 --> 01:44:15,109
suffering right if we say well life is
suffering then what am I doing that I'm

5528
01:44:15,109 --> 01:44:15,119
suffering then what am I doing that I'm
 

5529
01:44:15,119 --> 01:44:17,090
suffering then what am I doing that I'm
trying to erase from my mind like the

5530
01:44:17,090 --> 01:44:17,100
trying to erase from my mind like the
 

5531
01:44:17,100 --> 01:44:18,770
trying to erase from my mind like the
birth of my children right like things

5532
01:44:18,770 --> 01:44:18,780
birth of my children right like things
 

5533
01:44:18,780 --> 01:44:20,930
birth of my children right like things
that were filled with joy right like

5534
01:44:20,930 --> 01:44:20,940
that were filled with joy right like
 

5535
01:44:20,940 --> 01:44:24,050
that were filled with joy right like
life is not entirely suffering but life

5536
01:44:24,050 --> 01:44:24,060
life is not entirely suffering but life
 

5537
01:44:24,060 --> 01:44:26,689
life is not entirely suffering but life
brings a lot of suffering and for some

5538
01:44:26,689 --> 01:44:26,699
brings a lot of suffering and for some
 

5539
01:44:26,699 --> 01:44:28,689
brings a lot of suffering and for some
people it brings such disproportionate

5540
01:44:28,689 --> 01:44:28,699
people it brings such disproportionate
 

5541
01:44:28,699 --> 01:44:30,890
people it brings such disproportionate
suffering and the people don't survive

5542
01:44:30,890 --> 01:44:30,900
suffering and the people don't survive
 

5543
01:44:30,900 --> 01:44:32,510
suffering and the people don't survive
the suffering and I think when people

5544
01:44:32,510 --> 01:44:32,520
the suffering and I think when people
 

5545
01:44:32,520 --> 01:44:35,750
the suffering and I think when people
are conscientious and empathic that that

5546
01:44:35,750 --> 01:44:35,760
are conscientious and empathic that that
 

5547
01:44:35,760 --> 01:44:37,490
are conscientious and empathic that that
really bothers us right the suffering in

5548
01:44:37,490 --> 01:44:37,500
really bothers us right the suffering in
 

5549
01:44:37,500 --> 01:44:39,169
really bothers us right the suffering in
our own lives and the fact that others

5550
01:44:39,169 --> 01:44:39,179
our own lives and the fact that others
 

5551
01:44:39,179 --> 01:44:41,270
our own lives and the fact that others
at times could could seem to be so

5552
01:44:41,270 --> 01:44:41,280
at times could could seem to be so
 

5553
01:44:41,280 --> 01:44:42,950
at times could could seem to be so
overwhelmed by suffering that they don't

5554
01:44:42,950 --> 01:44:42,960
overwhelmed by suffering that they don't
 

5555
01:44:42,960 --> 01:44:44,149
overwhelmed by suffering that they don't
even get a chance

5556
01:44:44,149 --> 01:44:44,159
even get a chance
 

5557
01:44:44,159 --> 01:44:46,910
even get a chance
to see good and I think that there's I

5558
01:44:46,910 --> 01:44:46,920
to see good and I think that there's I
 

5559
01:44:46,920 --> 01:44:48,290
to see good and I think that there's I
do think there's truth to that and

5560
01:44:48,290 --> 01:44:48,300
do think there's truth to that and
 

5561
01:44:48,300 --> 01:44:50,689
do think there's truth to that and
there's sadness and distress to that but

5562
01:44:50,689 --> 01:44:50,699
there's sadness and distress to that but
 

5563
01:44:50,699 --> 01:44:53,149
there's sadness and distress to that but
to say therefore life is suffering I

5564
01:44:53,149 --> 01:44:53,159
to say therefore life is suffering I
 

5565
01:44:53,159 --> 01:44:55,790
to say therefore life is suffering I
think is just completely untrue and you

5566
01:44:55,790 --> 01:44:55,800
think is just completely untrue and you
 

5567
01:44:55,800 --> 01:44:57,290
think is just completely untrue and you
know it ignores the fact that someone

5568
01:44:57,290 --> 01:44:57,300
know it ignores the fact that someone
 

5569
01:44:57,300 --> 01:44:58,850
know it ignores the fact that someone
even made a trombone right let alone

5570
01:44:58,850 --> 01:44:58,860
even made a trombone right let alone
 

5571
01:44:58,860 --> 01:45:00,290
even made a trombone right let alone
that there's a little bit out of sync

5572
01:45:00,290 --> 01:45:00,300
that there's a little bit out of sync
 

5573
01:45:00,300 --> 01:45:01,550
that there's a little bit out of sync
and someone's playing the trombone like

5574
01:45:01,550 --> 01:45:01,560
and someone's playing the trombone like
 

5575
01:45:01,560 --> 01:45:04,010
and someone's playing the trombone like
that's cool there's there's a you know

5576
01:45:04,010 --> 01:45:04,020
that's cool there's there's a you know
 

5577
01:45:04,020 --> 01:45:05,689
that's cool there's there's a you know
there's elements of the Absurd that you

5578
01:45:05,689 --> 01:45:05,699
there's elements of the Absurd that you
 

5579
01:45:05,699 --> 01:45:08,090
there's elements of the Absurd that you
said are neat and interesting and and if

5580
01:45:08,090 --> 01:45:08,100
said are neat and interesting and and if
 

5581
01:45:08,100 --> 01:45:10,129
said are neat and interesting and and if
we start accepting that we can't

5582
01:45:10,129 --> 01:45:10,139
we start accepting that we can't
 

5583
01:45:10,139 --> 01:45:12,830
we start accepting that we can't
understand or control everything then we

5584
01:45:12,830 --> 01:45:12,840
understand or control everything then we
 

5585
01:45:12,840 --> 01:45:15,410
understand or control everything then we
can accept and I think really love and

5586
01:45:15,410 --> 01:45:15,420
can accept and I think really love and
 

5587
01:45:15,420 --> 01:45:18,290
can accept and I think really love and
Foster the beauty in our lives

5588
01:45:18,290 --> 01:45:18,300
Foster the beauty in our lives
 

5589
01:45:18,300 --> 01:45:22,070
Foster the beauty in our lives
yeah I think uh the word suffering is

5590
01:45:22,070 --> 01:45:22,080
yeah I think uh the word suffering is
 

5591
01:45:22,080 --> 01:45:24,229
yeah I think uh the word suffering is
doing a little bit too much work because

5592
01:45:24,229 --> 01:45:24,239
doing a little bit too much work because
 

5593
01:45:24,239 --> 01:45:25,729
doing a little bit too much work because
I think it's probably referring to the

5594
01:45:25,729 --> 01:45:25,739
I think it's probably referring to the
 

5595
01:45:25,739 --> 01:45:28,910
I think it's probably referring to the
philosophical concept of that uh

5596
01:45:28,910 --> 01:45:28,920
philosophical concept of that uh
 

5597
01:45:28,920 --> 01:45:32,090
philosophical concept of that uh
yeah this is absurd the absurdity right

5598
01:45:32,090 --> 01:45:32,100
yeah this is absurd the absurdity right
 

5599
01:45:32,100 --> 01:45:34,790
yeah this is absurd the absurdity right
that stuff just happens randomly

5600
01:45:34,790 --> 01:45:34,800
that stuff just happens randomly
 

5601
01:45:34,800 --> 01:45:37,370
that stuff just happens randomly
um evil people succeed good people fail

5602
01:45:37,370 --> 01:45:37,380
um evil people succeed good people fail
 

5603
01:45:37,380 --> 01:45:40,070
um evil people succeed good people fail
right there's a seeming random Injustice

5604
01:45:40,070 --> 01:45:40,080
right there's a seeming random Injustice
 

5605
01:45:40,080 --> 01:45:43,370
right there's a seeming random Injustice

oftentimes we're way too close up to
 

5937

oftentimes we're way too close up to
that tapestry and what brings us close

5938
01:52:14,689 --> 01:52:14,699
that tapestry and what brings us close
 

5939
01:52:14,699 --> 01:52:16,250
that tapestry and what brings us close
is often the sad thing so we're up close

it's easy then to get classically

5944
01:52:20,030 --> 01:52:20,040
it's easy then to get classically
 

5945
01:52:20,040 --> 01:52:22,609
it's easy then to get classically

what's in them that's how people get
 

5951
01:52:27,960 --> 01:52:29,750
what's in them that's how people get
better and it's how people re-engage in

01:52:29,750 --> 01:52:29,760
better and it's how people re-engage in
 

5953
01:52:29,760 --> 01:52:33,290

01:52:33,290 --> 01:52:33,300
in life it's such a difficult thing
 

5955
01:52:33,300 --> 01:52:35,750
in life it's such a difficult thing
because if you were to

for studying human beings
it seems like the optimal trajectory

5960
01:52:41,510 --> 01:52:41,520
it seems like the optimal trajectory
 

5961
01:52:41,520 --> 01:52:44,209
it seems like the optimal trajectory
is having some trauma that doesn't

5962
01:52:44,209 --> 01:52:44,219
is having some trauma that doesn't
 

5963

Human Condition
and then later in life as you form and

5972
01:52:56,870 --> 01:52:56,880
and then later in life as you form and
 

5973
01:52:56,880 --> 01:52:58,669
and then later in life as you form and
like you build an expertise around and

5974
01:52:58,669 --> 01:52:58,679
like you build an expertise around and
 

5975
01:52:58,679 --> 01:52:59,810
like you build an expertise around and
mastery

5976
01:52:59,810 --> 01:52:59,820
mastery
 

5977
01:52:59,820 --> 01:53:02,510

01:53:02,510 --> 01:53:02,520
start to do exactly what you said would
 

5979
01:53:02,520 --> 01:53:04,430
start to do exactly what you said would
you step back and look at the tapestry

5980
01:53:04,430 --> 01:53:04,440
you step back and look at the tapestry
 

5981
01:53:04,440 --> 01:53:08,330
you step back and look at the tapestry
so if you if if uh if you don't have the

5982
01:53:08,330 --> 01:53:08,340
so if you if if uh if you don't have the
 

5983
01:53:08,340 --> 01:53:10,310
so if you if if uh if you don't have the

trauma hardship difficulties I mean we
 

6069
01:54:43,800 --> 01:54:45,530
trauma hardship difficulties I mean we
could set aside we could we could set

could set aside we could we could set
 

6071
01:54:45,540 --> 01:54:47,990
could set aside we could we could set
apart say and differentiate things that

think that that kind of thing is good
 

6165
01:56:18,119 --> 01:56:20,330
think that that kind of thing is good
but if we separate that from something

6166
01:56:20,330 --> 01:56:20,340
but if we separate that from something
 

6167
01:56:20,340 --> 01:56:22,729
but if we separate that from something
that's just denigrating prejudicial like

6168
01:56:22,729 --> 01:56:22,739
that's just denigrating prejudicial like
 

6169
01:56:22,739 --> 01:56:24,590

they're unavoidable so it's not

6172
01:56:26,330 --> 01:56:26,340
they're unavoidable so it's not
 

6173
01:56:26,340 --> 01:56:27,950
they're unavoidable so it's not
necessarily that always some trauma good

6263
01:58:04,739 --> 01:58:07,790

um what can we say about the impact

6264
01:58:07,790 --> 01:58:07,800
um what can we say about the impact
 

6265
01:58:07,800 --> 01:58:10,729
um what can we say about the impact
of child abuse

6266

01:58:13,080 --> 01:58:15,589
on the development of a human being
I think

6270
01:58:15,589 --> 01:58:15,599
I think
 

6271
01:58:15,599 --> 01:58:18,709
I think
the impact of it is so

6272
01:58:18,709 --> 01:58:18,719
the impact of it is so
 

6273
01:58:18,719 --> 01:58:21,589
the impact of it is so
disproportionately

we're not children and and I want to be

we're not children and and I want to be
 

6281
01:58:28,679 --> 01:58:29,930
we're not children and and I want to be
very careful about how I'm saying that

6282
01:58:29,930 --> 01:58:29,940
very careful about how I'm saying that
 

6283
01:58:29,940 --> 01:58:32,270
very careful about how I'm saying that
because people can

6284
01:58:32,270 --> 01:58:32,280
because people can
 

6285
01:58:32,280 --> 01:58:34,070
because people can
through their strength and resilience

6286
01:58:34,070 --> 01:58:34,080
through their strength and resilience
 

6287
01:58:34,080 --> 01:58:37,370
through their strength and resilience
and and human interconnectedness can

6288
01:58:37,370 --> 01:58:37,380
and and human interconnectedness can
 

6289
01:58:37,380 --> 01:58:40,450
and and human interconnectedness can
overcome that I don't mean to say that

6290
01:58:40,450 --> 01:58:40,460
overcome that I don't mean to say that
 

6291

overcome that I don't mean to say that
anyone who's experienced those things is

6292
01:58:43,070 --> 01:58:43,080
anyone who's experienced those things is
 

6293
01:58:43,080 --> 01:58:45,770
anyone who's experienced those things is
can't make it through it or over it

6294
01:58:45,770 --> 01:58:45,780
can't make it through it or over it
 

6295
01:58:45,780 --> 01:58:47,990
can't make it through it or over it
that's that part is not true

6296
01:58:47,990 --> 01:58:48,000
that's that part is not true
 

6297
01:58:48,000 --> 01:58:51,050
that's that part is not true
but it is true that the impact is so

6298
01:58:51,050 --> 01:58:51,060
but it is true that the impact is so
 

6299
01:58:51,060 --> 01:58:53,089
but it is true that the impact is so
disproportionate to anything else that

6300
01:58:53,089 --> 01:58:53,099
disproportionate to anything else that
 

6301
01:58:53,099 --> 01:58:54,649
disproportionate to anything else that
can happen because the brain is

6302
01:58:54,649 --> 01:58:54,659
can happen because the brain is
 

6303
01:58:54,659 --> 01:58:57,109
can happen because the brain is
formulating right so so both you know

6304
01:58:57,109 --> 01:58:57,119
formulating right so so both you know
 

6305
01:58:57,119 --> 01:58:58,669
formulating right so so both you know
it's like if we say psychology is like

6306
01:58:58,669 --> 01:58:58,679
it's like if we say psychology is like
 

6307
01:58:58,679 --> 01:59:01,310
it's like if we say psychology is like
applied neurobiology right and we look

6308
01:59:01,310 --> 01:59:01,320
applied neurobiology right and we look
 

6309
01:59:01,320 --> 01:59:04,550
applied neurobiology right and we look
at both of those as a as as

6310
01:59:04,550 --> 01:59:04,560
at both of those as a as as
 

6311
01:59:04,560 --> 01:59:06,229
at both of those as a as as
um different ends right even though

6312
01:59:06,229 --> 01:59:06,239
um different ends right even though
 

6313
01:59:06,239 --> 01:59:08,030
um different ends right even though
there's a lot of gray in the middle you

6314
01:59:08,030 --> 01:59:08,040
there's a lot of gray in the middle you
 

6315
01:59:08,040 --> 01:59:10,790
there's a lot of gray in the middle you
know the the neurobiology is changed so

6316
01:59:10,790 --> 01:59:10,800
know the the neurobiology is changed so
 

6317
01:59:10,800 --> 01:59:14,089
know the the neurobiology is changed so
just just one example of a much greater

6318
01:59:14,089 --> 01:59:14,099
just just one example of a much greater
 

6319
01:59:14,099 --> 01:59:17,870
just just one example of a much greater
salience of uh vigilance mechanisms of

01:59:20,570 --> 01:59:20,580
of uh mechanisms of self-protection
 

6323
01:59:20,580 --> 01:59:23,689
of uh mechanisms of self-protection
mechanisms that can make a person feel

6324
01:59:23,689 --> 01:59:23,699
mechanisms that can make a person feel
 

6325
01:59:23,699 --> 01:59:26,270
mechanisms that can make a person feel
more fear and more insecurity and hide

6326

themselves away from the world and not
 

6329
01:59:28,260 --> 01:59:30,169

01:59:30,169 --> 01:59:30,179
trust the world and I mean I mean not
 

6331
01:59:30,179 --> 01:59:32,330

you know I'd like to have a better job

6334
01:59:33,589 --> 01:59:33,599
you know I'd like to have a better job
 

6335
01:59:33,599 --> 01:59:35,689
you know I'd like to have a better job
and there's and you know another one is

6336
01:59:35,689 --> 01:59:35,699
and there's and you know another one is
 

6337
01:59:35,699 --> 01:59:37,729
and there's and you know another one is
here that I could take but maybe it

6338
01:59:37,729 --> 01:59:37,739
here that I could take but maybe it
 

6339
01:59:37,739 --> 01:59:38,990
here that I could take but maybe it
could be worse you know they think of

6340
01:59:38,990 --> 01:59:39,000
could be worse you know they think of
 

6341
01:59:39,000 --> 01:59:40,729
could be worse you know they think of
being afraid of that right like there

6342
01:59:40,729 --> 01:59:40,739
being afraid of that right like there
 

6343
01:59:40,739 --> 01:59:42,830
being afraid of that right like there
are all sorts of ways in which in which

6344
01:59:42,830 --> 01:59:42,840
are all sorts of ways in which in which
 

6345
01:59:42,840 --> 01:59:45,470
are all sorts of ways in which in which
the changes to those Pathways impact

6346
01:59:45,470 --> 01:59:45,480
the changes to those Pathways impact
 

6347
01:59:45,480 --> 01:59:47,750
the changes to those Pathways impact
someone and and that's just one of you

6348
01:59:47,750 --> 01:59:47,760
someone and and that's just one of you
 

6349
01:59:47,760 --> 01:59:49,609
someone and and that's just one of you
know we could bring trauma experts

6350
01:59:49,609 --> 01:59:49,619
know we could bring trauma experts
 

6351
01:59:49,619 --> 01:59:50,870
know we could bring trauma experts
together that could talk about that for

6352
01:59:50,870 --> 01:59:50,880
together that could talk about that for
 

6353
01:59:50,880 --> 01:59:52,850
together that could talk about that for
days right like what is the impact upon

6354
01:59:52,850 --> 01:59:52,860
days right like what is the impact upon
 

6355
01:59:52,860 --> 01:59:55,729
days right like what is the impact upon
the brain biology so that then gets

6356
01:59:55,729 --> 01:59:55,739
the brain biology so that then gets
 

6357
01:59:55,739 --> 01:59:58,430
the brain biology so that then gets
changed inside the person and from the

6358
01:59:58,430 --> 01:59:58,440
changed inside the person and from the
 

6359
01:59:58,440 --> 02:00:00,410
changed inside the person and from the
perspective of those changes the

6360
02:00:00,410 --> 02:00:00,420
perspective of those changes the
 

6361
02:00:00,420 --> 02:00:02,030
perspective of those changes the
psychology on top of it changes like

6362
02:00:02,030 --> 02:00:02,040
psychology on top of it changes like
 

6363
02:00:02,040 --> 02:00:03,709
psychology on top of it changes like
what do I think about myself do I think

6364
02:00:03,709 --> 02:00:03,719
what do I think about myself do I think
 

6365
02:00:03,719 --> 02:00:05,930
what do I think about myself do I think
that I'm worthwhile you know even in my

6366
02:00:05,930 --> 02:00:05,940
that I'm worthwhile you know even in my
 

6367
02:00:05,940 --> 02:00:09,050
that I'm worthwhile you know even in my
mid-20s after you know uh without

6368
02:00:09,050 --> 02:00:09,060
mid-20s after you know uh without
 

6369
02:00:09,060 --> 02:00:11,089
mid-20s after you know uh without
formative traumas in a pretty strong

there was a there's a big trauma then

6374
02:00:14,810 --> 02:00:14,820
there was a there's a big trauma then
 

6375
02:00:14,820 --> 02:00:16,609
there was a there's a big trauma then
with the death of my brother and I start

6376
02:00:16,609 --> 02:00:16,619
with the death of my brother and I start
 

6377
02:00:16,619 --> 02:00:18,770
with the death of my brother and I start
questioning am I cursed am I worth

6378
02:00:18,770 --> 02:00:18,780
questioning am I cursed am I worth
 

6379

U.S economy just from schizophrenia and
 

6439
02:01:30,780 --> 02:01:31,910
U.S economy just from schizophrenia and
you think

6440
02:01:31,910 --> 02:01:31,920
you think
 

6441
02:01:31,920 --> 02:01:34,490
you think
it cost a fraction what do we actually

6442
02:01:34,490 --> 02:01:34,500
it cost a fraction what do we actually
 

6443
02:01:34,500 --> 02:01:36,470
it cost a fraction what do we actually
put into caring for people who have

6444
02:01:36,470 --> 02:01:36,480
put into caring for people who have
 

6445
02:01:36,480 --> 02:01:38,930
put into caring for people who have
schizophrenia so so first there's a

6446
02:01:38,930 --> 02:01:38,940
schizophrenia so so first there's a
 

6447
02:01:38,940 --> 02:01:40,669
schizophrenia so so first there's a
moral imperative but let's say we put

6448
02:01:40,669 --> 02:01:40,679
moral imperative but let's say we put
 

6449
02:01:40,679 --> 02:01:43,070
moral imperative but let's say we put
that aside and we only care about the

6450
02:01:43,070 --> 02:01:43,080
that aside and we only care about the
 

6451
02:01:43,080 --> 02:01:44,750
that aside and we only care about the
economy right because there are

6452
02:01:44,750 --> 02:01:44,760
economy right because there are
 

6453
02:01:44,760 --> 02:01:46,609
economy right because there are
mechanisms of thinking that look at it

6454
02:01:46,609 --> 02:01:46,619
mechanisms of thinking that look at it
 

6455
02:01:46,619 --> 02:01:48,950
mechanisms of thinking that look at it
that way how could we not amend that

6456
02:01:48,950 --> 02:01:48,960
that way how could we not amend that
 

6457
02:01:48,960 --> 02:01:52,010
that way how could we not amend that
right but we are so reckless with our

02:01:52,010 --> 02:01:52,020
right but we are so reckless with our
 

6459
02:01:52,020 --> 02:01:53,930
right but we are so reckless with our
resources and we're tripping ahead of

okay we know there's a higher prevalence

of that but we're also creating the pool

you know we're not and we tend to just
 

6499
02:02:37,739 --> 02:02:39,890
you know we're not and we tend to just
kind of call it good because we don't

um and I think there's a societal
 

6507
02:02:44,880 --> 02:02:46,729
um and I think there's a societal
negligence there to the shame really of

negligence there to the shame really of

um when child abuse and the impact
 

6513
02:02:51,440 --> 02:02:54,470
um when child abuse and the impact
neurobiologically and psychologically is

neurobiologically and psychologically is
 

6515

others right what we're doing is we're
 

6555
02:03:37,560 --> 02:03:40,609
others right what we're doing is we're
pushing towards isolation and misery and

6556
02:03:40,609 --> 02:03:40,619
pushing towards isolation and misery and
 

6557
02:03:40,619 --> 02:03:42,649
pushing towards isolation and misery and
depression and resentment I mean those

depression and resentment I mean those
 

6559
02:03:42,659 --> 02:03:44,750
depression and resentment I mean those
factors push towards that you know we

02:03:44,750 --> 02:03:44,760
factors push towards that you know we
 

6561
02:03:44,760 --> 02:03:46,910
factors push towards that you know we
know that the research is so strong that

6562
02:03:46,910 --> 02:03:46,920
know that the research is so strong that
 

6563
02:03:46,920 --> 02:03:48,530
know that the research is so strong that
at you know adverse childhood

6564
02:03:48,530 --> 02:03:48,540
at you know adverse childhood
 

6565
02:03:48,540 --> 02:03:50,330
at you know adverse childhood
experiences and these things that happen

6566
02:03:50,330 --> 02:03:50,340
experiences and these things that happen
 

6567
02:03:50,340 --> 02:03:53,270
experiences and these things that happen
the more the worse the more prolonged

6568
02:03:53,270 --> 02:03:53,280
the more the worse the more prolonged
 

6569
02:03:53,280 --> 02:03:56,330
the more the worse the more prolonged
the more that person is up against as

6570
02:03:56,330 --> 02:03:56,340
the more that person is up against as
 

6571
02:03:56,340 --> 02:03:59,270
the more that person is up against as
they try and navigate life

6572
02:03:59,270 --> 02:03:59,280
they try and navigate life
 

6573
02:03:59,280 --> 02:04:02,810
they try and navigate life
and uh I suppose one of the elements of

6574
02:04:02,810 --> 02:04:02,820
and uh I suppose one of the elements of
 

6575
02:04:02,820 --> 02:04:04,310
and uh I suppose one of the elements of
intimacy like what we're talking about

6576
02:04:04,310 --> 02:04:04,320
intimacy like what we're talking about
 

6577
02:04:04,320 --> 02:04:06,229
intimacy like what we're talking about
is is vulnerability

6578
02:04:06,229 --> 02:04:06,239
is is vulnerability
 

6579
02:04:06,239 --> 02:04:08,450
is is vulnerability
and maybe there's a

6580
02:04:08,450 --> 02:04:08,460
and maybe there's a
 

6581
02:04:08,460 --> 02:04:11,689
and maybe there's a
is there a fear of being vulnerable

6582
02:04:11,689 --> 02:04:11,699
is there a fear of being vulnerable
 

6583
02:04:11,699 --> 02:04:14,149
is there a fear of being vulnerable
of being hurt again

6584
02:04:14,149 --> 02:04:14,159
of being hurt again
 

6585
02:04:14,159 --> 02:04:16,430
of being hurt again
is that ultimately the barrier to

6586
02:04:16,430 --> 02:04:16,440
is that ultimately the barrier to
 

6587
02:04:16,440 --> 02:04:18,649
is that ultimately the barrier to
intimacy yeah if you taught a lesson

6588
02:04:18,649 --> 02:04:18,659
intimacy yeah if you taught a lesson
 

6589
02:04:18,659 --> 02:04:21,290
intimacy yeah if you taught a lesson
that says the world is not safe

6590
02:04:21,290 --> 02:04:21,300
that says the world is not safe
 

6591
02:04:21,300 --> 02:04:23,030
that says the world is not safe
and you're not good enough for someone

6592
02:04:23,030 --> 02:04:23,040
and you're not good enough for someone
 

6593
02:04:23,040 --> 02:04:25,310
and you're not good enough for someone
to keep safe and you're not strong

6594
02:04:25,310 --> 02:04:25,320
to keep safe and you're not strong
 

6595
02:04:25,320 --> 02:04:27,830
to keep safe and you're not strong
enough to keep yourself safe that's a

enough to keep yourself safe that's a
 

6597
02:04:27,840 --> 02:04:30,830
enough to keep yourself safe that's a
final common pathway of of the vast

6598
02:04:30,830 --> 02:04:30,840
final common pathway of of the vast
 

6599
02:04:30,840 --> 02:04:32,870

02:04:32,870 --> 02:04:32,880
majority of child abuse right is telling
 

6601
02:04:32,880 --> 02:04:36,109
majority of child abuse right is telling
those lessons to people then how how can

6602
02:04:36,109 --> 02:04:36,119
those lessons to people then how how can
 

6603
02:04:36,119 --> 02:04:37,370
those lessons to people then how how can
that not

6604
02:04:37,370 --> 02:04:37,380
that not

02:04:44,699 --> 02:04:46,729
to rationally consider trust and
mutuality and to protect oneself but

mutuality and to protect oneself but
 

6613
02:04:46,739 --> 02:04:48,649
mutuality and to protect oneself but
also take chances and you know do the

6614
02:04:48,649 --> 02:04:48,659
also take chances and you know do the
 

6615
02:04:48,659 --> 02:04:50,629
also take chances and you know do the
things that we have to do to to create

6616
02:04:50,629 --> 02:04:50,639
things that we have to do to to create
 

6617
02:04:50,639 --> 02:04:53,089
things that we have to do to to create
the greatest happiness in our lives we

6618
02:04:53,089 --> 02:04:53,099
the greatest happiness in our lives we
 

6619
02:04:53,099 --> 02:04:56,390
the greatest happiness in our lives we
set the odds so much against us as

6620
02:04:56,390 --> 02:04:56,400
set the odds so much against us as
 

6621
02:04:56,400 --> 02:04:58,729
set the odds so much against us as
another pathway which I think is uh is

6622
02:04:58,729 --> 02:04:58,739
another pathway which I think is uh is
 

6623
02:04:58,739 --> 02:04:59,629
another pathway which I think is uh is
really

6624
02:04:59,629 --> 02:04:59,639
really
 

6625
02:04:59,639 --> 02:05:02,390
really
interesting because of uh I've seen it

6626
02:05:02,390 --> 02:05:02,400
interesting because of uh I've seen it
 

6627
02:05:02,400 --> 02:05:04,550
interesting because of uh I've seen it
in people is is this kind of ability to

6628
02:05:04,550 --> 02:05:04,560
in people is is this kind of ability to
 

6629
02:05:04,560 --> 02:05:06,410
in people is is this kind of ability to
detach yourself

6630
02:05:06,410 --> 02:05:06,420
detach yourself
 

6631
02:05:06,420 --> 02:05:09,649
detach yourself
from feeling any emotions

6632
02:05:09,649 --> 02:05:09,659
from feeling any emotions
 

6633
02:05:09,659 --> 02:05:11,510
from feeling any emotions
to like protect yourself

6634
02:05:11,510 --> 02:05:11,520
to like protect yourself
 

6635
02:05:11,520 --> 02:05:13,910
to like protect yourself
it's almost like you're not quite there

6636
02:05:13,910 --> 02:05:13,920
it's almost like you're not quite there
 

6637
02:05:13,920 --> 02:05:16,070
it's almost like you're not quite there
it is a word physical isolation of

6638
02:05:16,070 --> 02:05:16,080
it is a word physical isolation of
 

6639
02:05:16,080 --> 02:05:18,109
it is a word physical isolation of
affect it's a defense mechanism yeah

6640
02:05:18,109 --> 02:05:18,119
affect it's a defense mechanism yeah
 

6641
02:05:18,119 --> 02:05:20,450
affect it's a defense mechanism yeah
isolation of affect yeah is that a

6642
02:05:20,450 --> 02:05:20,460
isolation of affect yeah is that a
 

6643
02:05:20,460 --> 02:05:22,550
isolation of affect yeah is that a
common weight another

6644
02:05:22,550 --> 02:05:22,560
common weight another
 

6645
02:05:22,560 --> 02:05:24,830
common weight another
common way to deal with trauma

6646
02:05:24,830 --> 02:05:24,840
common way to deal with trauma
 

6647
02:05:24,840 --> 02:05:25,850
common way to deal with trauma
well

6648
02:05:25,850 --> 02:05:25,860
well
 

6649
02:05:25,860 --> 02:05:28,790
well
isolation of affect can cut both ways so

6650
02:05:28,790 --> 02:05:28,800
isolation of affect can cut both ways so
 

6651
02:05:28,800 --> 02:05:31,129
isolation of affect can cut both ways so
so if there's been a major trauma let's

6652
02:05:31,129 --> 02:05:31,139
so if there's been a major trauma let's
 

6653
02:05:31,139 --> 02:05:32,629
so if there's been a major trauma let's
say someone has seen something terrible

6654
02:05:32,629 --> 02:05:32,639
say someone has seen something terrible
 

6655
02:05:32,639 --> 02:05:35,390
say someone has seen something terrible
and they're isolated from their affect

6656
02:05:35,390 --> 02:05:35,400
and they're isolated from their affect
 

6657
02:05:35,400 --> 02:05:37,310
and they're isolated from their affect
and at one time it was thought well

6658
02:05:37,310 --> 02:05:37,320
and at one time it was thought well
 

6659
02:05:37,320 --> 02:05:38,750
and at one time it was thought well
maybe that's good right they're not

6660
02:05:38,750 --> 02:05:38,760
maybe that's good right they're not
 

6661
02:05:38,760 --> 02:05:40,850
maybe that's good right they're not
hysterical they're not distraught but we

6662
02:05:40,850 --> 02:05:40,860
hysterical they're not distraught but we
 

6663
02:05:40,860 --> 02:05:43,729
hysterical they're not distraught but we
see that is not good right because what

6664
02:05:43,729 --> 02:05:43,739
see that is not good right because what
 

6665
02:05:43,739 --> 02:05:47,089
see that is not good right because what
needs to be be held processed you know

6666
02:05:47,089 --> 02:05:47,099
needs to be be held processed you know
 

6667
02:05:47,099 --> 02:05:48,470
needs to be be held processed you know
we need to get our arms around in some

6668
02:05:48,470 --> 02:05:48,480
we need to get our arms around in some
 

6669
02:05:48,480 --> 02:05:49,609
we need to get our arms around in some
way shape or form has just been

6670
02:05:49,609 --> 02:05:49,619
way shape or form has just been
 

6671
02:05:49,619 --> 02:05:52,490
way shape or form has just been
separated off right so we know that is

6672
02:05:52,490 --> 02:05:52,500
separated off right so we know that is
 

6673
02:05:52,500 --> 02:05:55,669
separated off right so we know that is
not good right but isolation of affect

6674
02:05:55,669 --> 02:05:55,679
not good right but isolation of affect
 

6675
02:05:55,679 --> 02:05:58,370
not good right but isolation of affect
can also serve us very well when I think

6676
02:05:58,370 --> 02:05:58,380
can also serve us very well when I think
 

6677
02:05:58,380 --> 02:06:00,890
can also serve us very well when I think
back to being an intern you know a

6678
02:06:00,890 --> 02:06:00,900
back to being an intern you know a
 

6679
02:06:00,900 --> 02:06:02,990
back to being an intern you know a
medical intern in the hospital and you

02:06:11,820 --> 02:06:14,270
with hysterical family members and then
you know 10 minutes later five minutes

6688
02:06:14,270 --> 02:06:14,280
you know 10 minutes later five minutes
 

6689
02:06:14,280 --> 02:06:16,490
you know 10 minutes later five minutes
later might be two minutes later really

6690
02:06:16,490 --> 02:06:16,500
later might be two minutes later really
 

6691
02:06:16,500 --> 02:06:19,070
later might be two minutes later really
you know you have to go to another room

6692
02:06:19,070 --> 02:06:19,080
you know you have to go to another room
 

6693
02:06:19,080 --> 02:06:20,990
you know you have to go to another room

and you've got to maybe do some
 

6695
02:06:21,000 --> 02:06:23,030
and you've got to maybe do some
procedure that involves you know having

your focus on on a certain thing and
 

6699
02:06:25,679 --> 02:06:26,990
your focus on on a certain thing and
making sure your hand movements are the

6700
02:06:26,990 --> 02:06:27,000
making sure your hand movements are the
 

6701
02:06:27,000 --> 02:06:28,790
making sure your hand movements are the
right way or talking to a person in a

6702
02:06:28,790 --> 02:06:28,800
right way or talking to a person in a
 

6703
02:06:28,800 --> 02:06:30,830
right way or talking to a person in a
way that is uh that's very different

6704
02:06:30,830 --> 02:06:30,840
way that is uh that's very different
 

6705
02:06:30,840 --> 02:06:32,330
way that is uh that's very different
than where you just came from that's

6706
02:06:32,330 --> 02:06:32,340
than where you just came from that's
 

6707
02:06:32,340 --> 02:06:34,370
than where you just came from that's
very hopeful and so then you have to

6708
02:06:34,370 --> 02:06:34,380
very hopeful and so then you have to
 

6709
02:06:34,380 --> 02:06:36,290
very hopeful and so then you have to
isolate the affect of what's going on

6710
02:06:36,290 --> 02:06:36,300
isolate the affect of what's going on
 

6711
02:06:36,300 --> 02:06:38,270
isolate the affect of what's going on
around you and it happens not just in

6712
02:06:38,270 --> 02:06:38,280
around you and it happens not just in
 

6713
02:06:38,280 --> 02:06:40,850
around you and it happens not just in
it's just one example but we have to do

6714
02:06:40,850 --> 02:06:40,860
it's just one example but we have to do
 

6715
02:06:40,860 --> 02:06:44,209
it's just one example but we have to do
it in life so that we can put affect

6716
02:06:44,209 --> 02:06:44,219
it in life so that we can put affect
 

6717
02:06:44,219 --> 02:06:46,729
it in life so that we can put affect
aside to process later or not feel the

6718
02:06:46,729 --> 02:06:46,739
aside to process later or not feel the
 

6719
02:06:46,739 --> 02:06:49,189
aside to process later or not feel the
full weight of affect where we know the

6720
02:06:49,189 --> 02:06:49,199
full weight of affect where we know the
 

6721
02:06:49,199 --> 02:06:50,629
full weight of affect where we know the
meaning like I know the meaning of the

6722
02:06:50,629 --> 02:06:50,639
meaning like I know the meaning of the
 

6723
02:06:50,639 --> 02:06:52,250
meaning like I know the meaning of the
tragedy of the person I just pronounced

6724
02:06:52,250 --> 02:06:52,260
tragedy of the person I just pronounced
 

6725
02:06:52,260 --> 02:06:54,350
tragedy of the person I just pronounced
dead but I want to separate that for

6726
02:06:54,350 --> 02:06:54,360
dead but I want to separate that for
 

6727
02:06:54,360 --> 02:06:55,850
dead but I want to separate that for
myself because I'm also aware that it's

6728
02:06:55,850 --> 02:06:55,860
myself because I'm also aware that it's
 

6729
02:06:55,860 --> 02:06:58,129
myself because I'm also aware that it's
not my tragedy so that I can then okay

6730
02:06:58,129 --> 02:06:58,139
not my tragedy so that I can then okay
 

6731
02:06:58,139 --> 02:06:59,990
not my tragedy so that I can then okay
put that affect aside and go do the next

6732
02:06:59,990 --> 02:07:00,000
put that affect aside and go do the next
 

6733
02:07:00,000 --> 02:07:02,149
put that affect aside and go do the next
thing that I have to do so that I think

6734
02:07:02,149 --> 02:07:02,159
thing that I have to do so that I think
 

6735
02:07:02,159 --> 02:07:04,550
thing that I have to do so that I think
can cut both ways

6736
02:07:04,550 --> 02:07:04,560
can cut both ways
 

6737
02:07:04,560 --> 02:07:07,430
can cut both ways
right but then you have to like reattach

6738
02:07:07,430 --> 02:07:07,440
right but then you have to like reattach
 

6739
02:07:07,440 --> 02:07:08,209
right but then you have to like reattach
it

6740
02:07:08,209 --> 02:07:08,219
it
 

6741
02:07:08,219 --> 02:07:10,370
it
understand that it's good to be close

6742
02:07:10,370 --> 02:07:10,380
understand that it's good to be close
 

6743
02:07:10,380 --> 02:07:13,189
understand that it's good to be close
with emotion even painful emotion

6744
02:07:13,189 --> 02:07:13,199
with emotion even painful emotion
 

6745
02:07:13,199 --> 02:07:15,169
with emotion even painful emotion
right right like because that's the

6746
02:07:15,169 --> 02:07:15,179
right right like because that's the
 

6747
02:07:15,179 --> 02:07:17,990
right right like because that's the
Human Experience right it's it's like I

6748
02:07:17,990 --> 02:07:18,000
Human Experience right it's it's like I
 

6749
02:07:18,000 --> 02:07:20,330
Human Experience right it's it's like I
feel like if you if you build up a skill

6750
02:07:20,330 --> 02:07:20,340
feel like if you if you build up a skill
 

6751
02:07:20,340 --> 02:07:21,770
feel like if you if you build up a skill
that you can detach yourself from

6752
02:07:21,770 --> 02:07:21,780
that you can detach yourself from
 

6753
02:07:21,780 --> 02:07:23,750
that you can detach yourself from
emotion

6754
02:07:23,750 --> 02:07:23,760
emotion
 

6755
02:07:23,760 --> 02:07:25,609
emotion
I think that could become its own kind

6756
02:07:25,609 --> 02:07:25,619
I think that could become its own kind
 

6757
02:07:25,619 --> 02:07:28,310
I think that could become its own kind
of yeah it becomes too easy to do it

6758
02:07:28,310 --> 02:07:28,320
of yeah it becomes too easy to do it
 

6759
02:07:28,320 --> 02:07:30,890
of yeah it becomes too easy to do it
yeah right and to reinforce that's when

6760
02:07:30,890 --> 02:07:30,900
yeah right and to reinforce that's when
 

6761
02:07:30,900 --> 02:07:33,169
yeah right and to reinforce that's when
people are suffering too much

6762
02:07:33,169 --> 02:07:33,179
people are suffering too much
 

6763
02:07:33,179 --> 02:07:36,530
people are suffering too much
over too long a period of time then you

6764
02:07:36,530 --> 02:07:36,540
over too long a period of time then you
 

6765
02:07:36,540 --> 02:07:38,750
over too long a period of time then you
know we're creatures of habit right and

6766
02:07:38,750 --> 02:07:38,760
know we're creatures of habit right and
 

6767
02:07:38,760 --> 02:07:40,609
know we're creatures of habit right and
even though our brains are you talking

6768
02:07:40,609 --> 02:07:40,619
even though our brains are you talking
 

6769
02:07:40,619 --> 02:07:41,750
even though our brains are you talking
about our brains are sitting on the

6770
02:07:41,750 --> 02:07:41,760
about our brains are sitting on the
 

6771
02:07:41,760 --> 02:07:44,689
about our brains are sitting on the
shoulders of the giant of the maybe a

6772
02:07:44,689 --> 02:07:44,699
shoulders of the giant of the maybe a
 

6773
02:07:44,699 --> 02:07:46,609
shoulders of the giant of the maybe a
thousand levels of emergence that come

6774
02:07:46,609 --> 02:07:46,619
thousand levels of emergence that come
 

6775
02:07:46,619 --> 02:07:48,890
thousand levels of emergence that come
underneath of them our brains are also

6776
02:07:48,890 --> 02:07:48,900
underneath of them our brains are also
 

6777
02:07:48,900 --> 02:07:51,709
underneath of them our brains are also
also working very simple habit based

6778
02:07:51,709 --> 02:07:51,719
also working very simple habit based
 

6779
02:07:51,719 --> 02:07:53,390
also working very simple habit based
ways like if you and I chose a word

6780
02:07:53,390 --> 02:07:53,400
ways like if you and I chose a word
 

6781
02:07:53,400 --> 02:07:56,689
ways like if you and I chose a word
right now and said it 500 times we would

6782
02:07:56,689 --> 02:07:56,699
right now and said it 500 times we would
 

6783
02:07:56,699 --> 02:07:58,550
right now and said it 500 times we would
know it's just a silly experiment but

6784
02:07:58,550 --> 02:07:58,560
know it's just a silly experiment but
 

6785
02:07:58,560 --> 02:08:00,830
know it's just a silly experiment but
we'd both be saying it tonight right

6786
02:08:00,830 --> 02:08:00,840
we'd both be saying it tonight right
 

6787
02:08:00,840 --> 02:08:02,990
we'd both be saying it tonight right
because our brains are also creatures of

6788
02:08:02,990 --> 02:08:03,000
because our brains are also creatures of
 

6789
02:08:03,000 --> 02:08:05,629
because our brains are also creatures of
habit so if you over and over and over

6790
02:08:05,629 --> 02:08:05,639
habit so if you over and over and over
 

6791
02:08:05,639 --> 02:08:08,510
habit so if you over and over and over
have to isolate yourself from affect and

6792
02:08:08,510 --> 02:08:08,520
have to isolate yourself from affect and
 

6793
02:08:08,520 --> 02:08:10,550
have to isolate yourself from affect and
you develop those mechanisms well you

6794
02:08:10,550 --> 02:08:10,560
you develop those mechanisms well you
 

6795
02:08:10,560 --> 02:08:12,649
you develop those mechanisms well you
develop those mechanisms and they don't

6796
02:08:12,649 --> 02:08:12,659
develop those mechanisms and they don't
 

6797
02:08:12,659 --> 02:08:14,570
develop those mechanisms and they don't
go away any easier than if we said the

6798
02:08:14,570 --> 02:08:14,580
go away any easier than if we said the
 

6799
02:08:14,580 --> 02:08:17,450
go away any easier than if we said the
word 500 times and decided to forget we

6800
02:08:17,450 --> 02:08:17,460
word 500 times and decided to forget we
 

6801
02:08:17,460 --> 02:08:20,229
word 500 times and decided to forget we
won't forget no matter what we decided

6802
02:08:20,229 --> 02:08:20,239
won't forget no matter what we decided
 

6803
02:08:20,239 --> 02:08:23,990
won't forget no matter what we decided
so how do we find our way back

6804
02:08:23,990 --> 02:08:24,000
so how do we find our way back
 

6805
02:08:24,000 --> 02:08:26,629
so how do we find our way back
how do we overcome

6806
02:08:26,629 --> 02:08:26,639
how do we overcome
 

6807
02:08:26,639 --> 02:08:28,490
how do we overcome
trauma what are the different Pathways

6808
02:08:28,490 --> 02:08:28,500
trauma what are the different Pathways
 

6809
02:08:28,500 --> 02:08:30,830
trauma what are the different Pathways
the first thing the very first thing is

6810
02:08:30,830 --> 02:08:30,840
the first thing the very first thing is
 

6811
02:08:30,840 --> 02:08:34,970
the first thing the very first thing is
to acknowledge to ourselves and often to

6812
02:08:34,970 --> 02:08:34,980
to acknowledge to ourselves and often to
 

6813
02:08:34,980 --> 02:08:36,649
to acknowledge to ourselves and often to
others which might be one other person

6814
02:08:36,649 --> 02:08:36,659
others which might be one other person
 

6815
02:08:36,659 --> 02:08:38,750
others which might be one other person
who might be in words spoken it might be

6816
02:08:38,750 --> 02:08:38,760
who might be in words spoken it might be
 

6817
02:08:38,760 --> 02:08:41,990
who might be in words spoken it might be
written like what the trauma has been

6818
02:08:41,990 --> 02:08:42,000
written like what the trauma has been
 

6819
02:08:42,000 --> 02:08:45,290
written like what the trauma has been
because the the lessons of trauma the

6820
02:08:45,290 --> 02:08:45,300
because the the lessons of trauma the
 

6821
02:08:45,300 --> 02:08:48,470
because the the lessons of trauma the
evil lessons of trauma and I'll use

6822
02:08:48,470 --> 02:08:48,480
evil lessons of trauma and I'll use
 

6823
02:08:48,480 --> 02:08:50,330
evil lessons of trauma and I'll use
example of my own life the lesson that

6824
02:08:50,330 --> 02:08:50,340
example of my own life the lesson that
 

6825
02:08:50,340 --> 02:08:55,010
example of my own life the lesson that
told me that I was shameful uh cursed

6826
02:08:55,010 --> 02:08:55,020
told me that I was shameful uh cursed
 

6827
02:08:55,020 --> 02:08:57,530
told me that I was shameful uh cursed
and hopeless right

6828
02:08:57,530 --> 02:08:57,540
and hopeless right
 

6829
02:08:57,540 --> 02:09:01,430
and hopeless right
it's a very evil lesson right but my

6830
02:09:01,430 --> 02:09:01,440
it's a very evil lesson right but my
 

6831
02:09:01,440 --> 02:09:03,470
it's a very evil lesson right but my
brain will say it over and did say it

6832
02:09:03,470 --> 02:09:03,480
brain will say it over and did say it
 

6833
02:09:03,480 --> 02:09:05,870
brain will say it over and did say it
over and over and over to me and if that

6834
02:09:05,870 --> 02:09:05,880
over and over and over to me and if that
 

6835
02:09:05,880 --> 02:09:08,510
over and over and over to me and if that
just sits inside that's how trauma

6836
02:09:08,510 --> 02:09:08,520
just sits inside that's how trauma
 

6837
02:09:08,520 --> 02:09:10,669
just sits inside that's how trauma
Fester is that's how trauma hijacks our

6838
02:09:10,669 --> 02:09:10,679
Fester is that's how trauma hijacks our
 

6839
02:09:10,679 --> 02:09:13,850
Fester is that's how trauma hijacks our
thoughts our emotions so being able to

6840
02:09:13,850 --> 02:09:13,860
thoughts our emotions so being able to
 

6841

6845
02:09:19,139 --> 02:09:20,990
this is what's happened right okay this
is what's happened we're built to

6846
02:09:20,990 --> 02:09:21,000
is what's happened we're built to
 

6847
02:09:21,000 --> 02:09:23,330
is what's happened we're built to
massage words and to create meaning

6848
02:09:23,330 --> 02:09:23,340
massage words and to create meaning
 

6849
02:09:23,340 --> 02:09:24,890
massage words and to create meaning
through words right like we don't

6850
02:09:24,890 --> 02:09:24,900
through words right like we don't
 

6851
02:09:24,900 --> 02:09:27,290
through words right like we don't
massage pictures write images we talk

6852
02:09:27,290 --> 02:09:27,300
massage pictures write images we talk

02:09:42,530 --> 02:09:42,540
I I can't
 

6865
02:09:42,540 --> 02:09:44,629

02:09:44,629 --> 02:09:44,639
accept it or I can't imagine it and like
 

6867
02:09:44,639 --> 02:09:46,490
accept it or I can't imagine it and like
I let it happen like so I had to say

6868
02:09:46,490 --> 02:09:46,500
I let it happen like so I had to say
 

6869
02:09:46,500 --> 02:09:48,950
I let it happen like so I had to say
those things right so then I could begin

6870
02:09:48,950 --> 02:09:48,960
those things right so then I could begin
 

6871
02:09:48,960 --> 02:09:51,770
those things right so then I could begin
to bring some sense of of truth to it

6872
02:09:51,770 --> 02:09:51,780
to bring some sense of of truth to it
 

6873
02:09:51,780 --> 02:09:53,330
to bring some sense of of truth to it
you know and I think it was a long time

6874
02:09:53,330 --> 02:09:53,340
you know and I think it was a long time
 

6875
02:09:53,340 --> 02:09:54,770
you know and I think it was a long time
ago but the therapist probably said

6876
02:09:54,770 --> 02:09:54,780
ago but the therapist probably said
 

6877
02:09:54,780 --> 02:09:56,510
ago but the therapist probably said
something like okay probably sees on you

6878
02:09:56,510 --> 02:09:56,520
something like okay probably sees on you
 

6879
02:09:56,520 --> 02:09:57,890
something like okay probably sees on you
it's you let it happen it's your fault

6880
02:09:57,890 --> 02:09:57,900
it's you let it happen it's your fault
 

6881

right because you got to get at those
 

6883
02:09:59,460 --> 02:10:02,270
right because you got to get at those
things so that so that one can begin to

6884
02:10:02,270 --> 02:10:02,280
things so that so that one can begin to
 

6885
02:10:02,280 --> 02:10:04,790
things so that so that one can begin to
bring into Focus what does the trauma

6886
02:10:04,790 --> 02:10:04,800
bring into Focus what does the trauma
 

6887

strongly and so
 

6943
02:10:58,679 --> 02:11:01,430
strongly and so
awfully so meanly that the person just

6944
02:11:01,430 --> 02:11:01,440
awfully so meanly that the person just
 

6945
02:11:01,440 --> 02:11:04,129
awfully so meanly that the person just
takes it inside and starts to see it as

sometimes you can get a person to see
 

6969
02:11:25,440 --> 02:11:27,169
sometimes you can get a person to see
like well that would be the most

6970
02:11:27,169 --> 02:11:27,179
like well that would be the most

be scared of anything you're thinking
 

6987
02:11:40,199 --> 02:11:42,890
be scared of anything you're thinking
and feeling in fact the fear is in not

6988

and feeling in fact the fear is in not
 

6989
02:11:42,900 --> 02:11:44,810
and feeling in fact the fear is in not
exposing it to the light to the light of

6990
02:11:44,810 --> 02:11:44,820
exposing it to the light to the light of
 

6991

exposing it to the light to the light of
day that's where it gets the best of us

and now like everything is different and
 

6995
02:11:49,080 --> 02:11:51,530
and now like everything is different and
whether that involves use of medications

6996
02:11:51,530 --> 02:11:51,540
whether that involves use of medications
 

6997
02:11:51,540 --> 02:11:53,330
whether that involves use of medications
for intrusive thoughts and and

6998
02:11:53,330 --> 02:11:53,340

needed but it's all reframing like
 

7003
02:11:56,340 --> 02:11:59,209
needed but it's all reframing like
whatever it may be that comes next the

7004
02:11:59,209 --> 02:11:59,219
whatever it may be that comes next the
 

7005
02:11:59,219 --> 02:12:01,550
whatever it may be that comes next the
whole world has changed when the person

long of qualified therapists who could
 

7165
02:15:06,000 --> 02:15:08,330
long of qualified therapists who could
be on that insurance panel but there's a

7166
02:15:08,330 --> 02:15:08,340
be on that insurance panel but there's a
 

7167
02:15:08,340 --> 02:15:10,250
be on that insurance panel but there's a
certification process like these make no

7168
02:15:10,250 --> 02:15:10,260
certification process like these make no
 

7169
02:15:10,260 --> 02:15:11,330
certification process like these make no
sense right the state's already

7170
02:15:11,330 --> 02:15:11,340
sense right the state's already
 

7171
02:15:11,340 --> 02:15:13,129
sense right the state's already
certified the person right but there's

7172
02:15:13,129 --> 02:15:13,139
certified the person right but there's
 

7173
02:15:13,139 --> 02:15:15,290
certified the person right but there's
so many barriers to entry that now we're

7174
02:15:15,290 --> 02:15:15,300
so many barriers to entry that now we're
 

7175
02:15:15,300 --> 02:15:17,450
so many barriers to entry that now we're
rationing this resource which we should

7176
02:15:17,450 --> 02:15:17,460
rationing this resource which we should
 

7177
02:15:17,460 --> 02:15:19,189
rationing this resource which we should
all stop and pause for a second and

7178
02:15:19,189 --> 02:15:19,199
all stop and pause for a second and
 

7179
02:15:19,199 --> 02:15:21,050
all stop and pause for a second and
think like we're okay with that as a

7180
02:15:21,050 --> 02:15:21,060
think like we're okay with that as a
 

7181
02:15:21,060 --> 02:15:22,189
think like we're okay with that as a
society and by the way everything else

7182
02:15:22,189 --> 02:15:22,199
society and by the way everything else
 

7183
02:15:22,199 --> 02:15:24,050
society and by the way everything else
is like that too when we're trying to

7184
02:15:24,050 --> 02:15:24,060
is like that too when we're trying to
 

7185
02:15:24,060 --> 02:15:26,390
is like that too when we're trying to
get help for our health so let's step

7186
02:15:26,390 --> 02:15:26,400
get help for our health so let's step
 

7187
02:15:26,400 --> 02:15:29,330
get help for our health so let's step
back from that for a second now it's a

7188
02:15:29,330 --> 02:15:29,340
back from that for a second now it's a
 

7189
02:15:29,340 --> 02:15:31,069
back from that for a second now it's a
resource that's not in great Supply and

7190
02:15:31,069 --> 02:15:31,079
resource that's not in great Supply and
 

7191
02:15:31,079 --> 02:15:32,870
resource that's not in great Supply and
then a person begins to think

7192
02:15:32,870 --> 02:15:32,880
then a person begins to think
 

7193
02:15:32,880 --> 02:15:34,669
then a person begins to think
you know essentially I'll take what I

7194
02:15:34,669 --> 02:15:34,679
you know essentially I'll take what I
 

7195
02:15:34,679 --> 02:15:35,629
you know essentially I'll take what I
can get like I've got to get somebody

7196

can get like I've got to get somebody
 

7197
02:15:35,639 --> 02:15:37,129
can get like I've got to get somebody

and I don't know enough to know anyway
 

7199
02:15:37,139 --> 02:15:39,530
and I don't know enough to know anyway

7200
02:15:39,530 --> 02:15:39,540
right and those are very disempowering

new things no this process of assessment
 

7263
02:16:43,320 --> 02:16:46,370
new things no this process of assessment
so that one isn't settling for something

7264
02:16:46,370 --> 02:16:46,380
so that one isn't settling for something
 

7265
02:16:46,380 --> 02:16:49,490
so that one isn't settling for something
that is formulaic over package and I'm

7266
02:16:49,490 --> 02:16:49,500
that is formulaic over package and I'm
 

7267
02:16:49,500 --> 02:16:50,750
that is formulaic over package and I'm
not trying to be overly critical of

7268
02:16:50,750 --> 02:16:50,760
not trying to be overly critical of
 

7269
02:16:50,760 --> 02:16:51,709
not trying to be overly critical of
therapists I mean there are people

7270
02:16:51,709 --> 02:16:51,719
therapists I mean there are people
 

7271
02:16:51,719 --> 02:16:53,270
therapists I mean there are people
everywhere who do their jobs well and

7272
02:16:53,270 --> 02:16:53,280
everywhere who do their jobs well and
 

7273
02:16:53,280 --> 02:16:55,610
everywhere who do their jobs well and
people who don't do their jobs well but

7274
02:16:55,610 --> 02:16:55,620
people who don't do their jobs well but
 

7275
02:16:55,620 --> 02:16:58,370
people who don't do their jobs well but
most therapists are working in systems

7276
02:16:58,370 --> 02:16:58,380
most therapists are working in systems
 

7277
02:16:58,380 --> 02:17:01,429
most therapists are working in systems
that push against doing the job well

7278
02:17:01,429 --> 02:17:01,439
that push against doing the job well
 

7279
02:17:01,439 --> 02:17:03,169
that push against doing the job well
right because they're rationing care and

7280
02:17:03,169 --> 02:17:03,179
right because they're rationing care and
 

7281
02:17:03,179 --> 02:17:04,669
right because they're rationing care and
there's a lot of number of sessions and

7282
02:17:04,669 --> 02:17:04,679
there's a lot of number of sessions and
 

7283
02:17:04,679 --> 02:17:06,410
there's a lot of number of sessions and
there's enough such time before a person

7284
02:17:06,410 --> 02:17:06,420
there's enough such time before a person
 

7285
02:17:06,420 --> 02:17:08,810
there's enough such time before a person
can return and so often it's an uphill

7286
02:17:08,810 --> 02:17:08,820
can return and so often it's an uphill
 

7287
02:17:08,820 --> 02:17:10,610
can return and so often it's an uphill
battle because we're trying to be helped

7288
02:17:10,610 --> 02:17:10,620
battle because we're trying to be helped
 

7289
02:17:10,620 --> 02:17:13,429
battle because we're trying to be helped
within systems we've created and

7290
02:17:13,429 --> 02:17:13,439
within systems we've created and
 

7291
02:17:13,439 --> 02:17:16,610
within systems we've created and
tolerate that are pushing against

7292
02:17:16,610 --> 02:17:16,620
tolerate that are pushing against
 

7293
02:17:16,620 --> 02:17:18,770
tolerate that are pushing against
helping us

7294
02:17:18,770 --> 02:17:18,780

they've got it all figured out right and
 

7317
02:17:45,000 --> 02:17:48,169
they've got it all figured out right and
I'm a mess and therefore if there's

7318
02:17:48,169 --> 02:17:48,179
I'm a mess and therefore if there's
 

7319
02:17:48,179 --> 02:17:51,169
I'm a mess and therefore if there's
something off it's all my fault

7320
02:17:51,169 --> 02:17:51,179
something off it's all my fault
 

7321
02:17:51,179 --> 02:17:53,450
something off it's all my fault
all right so it's a very tricky and it's

7322
02:17:53,450 --> 02:17:53,460
all right so it's a very tricky and it's
 

7323
02:17:53,460 --> 02:17:55,190
all right so it's a very tricky and it's
easy to then give up and then because

7324
02:17:55,190 --> 02:17:55,200
easy to then give up and then because
 

7325
02:17:55,200 --> 02:17:57,410
easy to then give up and then because
it's like that's step to try to get a

7326
02:17:57,410 --> 02:17:57,420
it's like that's step to try to get a
 

7327
02:17:57,420 --> 02:17:59,870
it's like that's step to try to get a
therapist the first like step to get

7328
02:17:59,870 --> 02:17:59,880
therapist the first like step to get
 

7329
02:17:59,880 --> 02:18:01,669
therapist the first like step to get
help forget therapists like any kind of

7330
02:18:01,669 --> 02:18:01,679
help forget therapists like any kind of
 

7331
02:18:01,679 --> 02:18:04,610
help forget therapists like any kind of
help that's a big leap to take I guess

7332
02:18:04,610 --> 02:18:04,620
help that's a big leap to take I guess
 

7333
02:18:04,620 --> 02:18:06,169
help that's a big leap to take I guess
when you're in a rough place I agree

7334
02:18:06,169 --> 02:18:06,179
when you're in a rough place I agree
 

7335
02:18:06,179 --> 02:18:08,629
when you're in a rough place I agree
completely we should not make people

7336
02:18:08,629 --> 02:18:08,639
completely we should not make people
 

7337
02:18:08,639 --> 02:18:11,810
completely we should not make people
swim against such a strong current to

7338
02:18:11,810 --> 02:18:11,820
swim against such a strong current to
 

7339
02:18:11,820 --> 02:18:13,610
swim against such a strong current to
get their needs met I mean we see this

7340
02:18:13,610 --> 02:18:13,620
get their needs met I mean we see this
 

7341
02:18:13,620 --> 02:18:16,669
get their needs met I mean we see this
in such obvious places where you have an

7342
02:18:16,669 --> 02:18:16,679
in such obvious places where you have an
 

7343
02:18:16,679 --> 02:18:19,009
in such obvious places where you have an
elderly homebound person who can't get

7344
02:18:19,009 --> 02:18:19,019
elderly homebound person who can't get
 

7345
02:18:19,019 --> 02:18:20,990
elderly homebound person who can't get
their medicine because oh there's been

7346
02:18:20,990 --> 02:18:21,000
their medicine because oh there's been
 

7347
02:18:21,000 --> 02:18:22,310
their medicine because oh there's been
some change and they didn't put the new

7348
02:18:22,310 --> 02:18:22,320
some change and they didn't put the new
 

7349
02:18:22,320 --> 02:18:24,950
some change and they didn't put the new
number into the form or Lord knows what

7350
02:18:24,950 --> 02:18:24,960
number into the form or Lord knows what
 

7351
02:18:24,960 --> 02:18:28,490
number into the form or Lord knows what
I mean it's it's incredible how we force

7352
02:18:28,490 --> 02:18:28,500
I mean it's it's incredible how we force
 

7353
02:18:28,500 --> 02:18:30,589
I mean it's it's incredible how we force
people to swim against strong currents

7354
02:18:30,589 --> 02:18:30,599
people to swim against strong currents
 

7355
02:18:30,599 --> 02:18:33,349
people to swim against strong currents
to get things that are just basic at

02:18:33,349 --> 02:18:33,359
to get things that are just basic at
 

7357
02:18:33,359 --> 02:18:36,469
to get things that are just basic at
times for their survival and and with

times for their survival and and with
 

7359
02:18:36,479 --> 02:18:37,969

that in mind I don't have a lot of

otherwise what you're saying which is I
think completely true will only become

think completely true will only become
 

7407
02:19:36,479 --> 02:19:38,270
think completely true will only become
worse as there's more and more barriers

worse as there's more and more barriers

to getting the help a person needs and

each time a person isn't helped it sets
the odds against them getting more help

the odds against them getting more help
 

7415
02:19:44,219 --> 02:19:47,089
the odds against them getting more help
I I should say here that you know when I

7416
02:19:47,089 --> 02:19:47,099
I I should say here that you know when I
 

7417
02:19:47,099 --> 02:19:48,770
I I should say here that you know when I
started working there were times I would

7418
02:19:48,770 --> 02:19:48,780
started working there were times I would
 

7419
02:19:48,780 --> 02:19:50,389
started working there were times I would
send people to an emergency room right

7420

send people to an emergency room right
 

7421
02:19:50,399 --> 02:19:51,950
send people to an emergency room right
if there's some emergency you know

if there's some emergency you know

02:19:51,960 --> 02:19:53,090
if there's some emergency you know
emergency in their mental health and

7424
02:19:53,090 --> 02:19:53,100
emergency in their mental health and
 

7425
02:19:53,100 --> 02:19:54,830
emergency in their mental health and
they were at risk and there were times

02:19:54,830 --> 02:19:54,840
they were at risk and there were times
 

7427
02:19:54,840 --> 02:19:56,570
they were at risk and there were times
I'd send somebody to an emergency room

7428
02:19:56,570 --> 02:19:56,580
I'd send somebody to an emergency room
 

7429
02:19:56,580 --> 02:19:58,490
I'd send somebody to an emergency room
where if you stopped and looked it would

7430
02:19:58,490 --> 02:19:58,500
where if you stopped and looked it would
 

7431
02:19:58,500 --> 02:20:00,170
where if you stopped and looked it would
have been malpractice not to do that

7432
02:20:00,170 --> 02:20:00,180
have been malpractice not to do that
 

7433
02:20:00,180 --> 02:20:06,110
have been malpractice not to do that
right now it's not just me who who has

7434
02:20:06,110 --> 02:20:06,120
right now it's not just me who who has
 

7435
02:20:06,120 --> 02:20:09,170
right now it's not just me who who has
an incredibly High threshold for sending

7436
02:20:09,170 --> 02:20:09,180
an incredibly High threshold for sending
 

7437
02:20:09,180 --> 02:20:10,670
an incredibly High threshold for sending
someone to an emergency room because you

7438
02:20:10,670 --> 02:20:10,680
someone to an emergency room because you
 

7439
02:20:10,680 --> 02:20:12,530
someone to an emergency room because you
send someone who's in a lot of distress

7440
02:20:12,530 --> 02:20:12,540
send someone who's in a lot of distress
 

7441
02:20:12,540 --> 02:20:14,090
send someone who's in a lot of distress
and oftentimes they're sitting on a

7442
02:20:14,090 --> 02:20:14,100
and oftentimes they're sitting on a
 

7443
02:20:14,100 --> 02:20:16,610
and oftentimes they're sitting on a
gurney in a hallway or they're locked in

7444
02:20:16,610 --> 02:20:16,620
gurney in a hallway or they're locked in
 

7445
02:20:16,620 --> 02:20:18,230
gurney in a hallway or they're locked in
a small white room and all they had was

7446
02:20:18,230 --> 02:20:18,240
a small white room and all they had was
 

7447
02:20:18,240 --> 02:20:20,030
a small white room and all they had was
depression you know they're just scared

7448
02:20:20,030 --> 02:20:20,040
depression you know they're just scared
 

7449
02:20:20,040 --> 02:20:22,370
depression you know they're just scared
when they go in and 36 hours later oh

7450
02:20:22,370 --> 02:20:22,380
when they go in and 36 hours later oh
 

7451
02:20:22,380 --> 02:20:23,510
when they go in and 36 hours later oh
they're feeling a little better why

7452
02:20:23,510 --> 02:20:23,520
they're feeling a little better why
 

7453
02:20:23,520 --> 02:20:24,650
they're feeling a little better why
because they're desperate to get out of

7454
02:20:24,650 --> 02:20:24,660
because they're desperate to get out of
 

7455
02:20:24,660 --> 02:20:26,630
because they're desperate to get out of
there and someone sends them home I mean

7456
02:20:26,630 --> 02:20:26,640
there and someone sends them home I mean
 

7457
02:20:26,640 --> 02:20:30,050
there and someone sends them home I mean
so our systems have shifted so much that

7458
02:20:30,050 --> 02:20:30,060
so our systems have shifted so much that
 

7459
02:20:30,060 --> 02:20:33,770
so our systems have shifted so much that
we we tolerate now on mass what is

7460
02:20:33,770 --> 02:20:33,780
we we tolerate now on mass what is
 

7461
02:20:33,780 --> 02:20:37,250
we we tolerate now on mass what is
egregious to the individual

7462
02:20:37,250 --> 02:20:37,260

 

7463
02:20:37,260 --> 02:20:40,690

so you are a psychiatrist in terms of

7464
02:20:40,690 --> 02:20:40,700
so you are a psychiatrist in terms of
 

7465
02:20:40,700 --> 02:20:44,630
so you are a psychiatrist in terms of
doing therapy psychotherapy

7466
02:20:44,630 --> 02:20:44,640
doing therapy psychotherapy
 

7467
02:20:44,640 --> 02:20:46,309
doing therapy psychotherapy
what does the successful interaction

7468
02:20:46,309 --> 02:20:46,319
what does the successful interaction
 

7469
02:20:46,319 --> 02:20:49,130
what does the successful interaction
look like perhaps a fun question uh

could be true but it doesn't mean we're
not just two humans doing something

7885
02:28:12,960 --> 02:28:14,270
that they know a lot but don't know the
answer to this you see that a lot in

7886
02:28:14,270 --> 02:28:14,280
answer to this you see that a lot in
 

7887
02:28:14,280 --> 02:28:16,010
answer to this you see that a lot in
medicine that person knows they're an

the best answer instead of someone who

7896
02:28:22,429 --> 02:28:22,439
the best answer instead of someone who
 

7897
02:28:22,439 --> 02:28:24,170
the best answer instead of someone who
is an expert and always knows the answer

is an expert and always knows the answer
 

7899
02:28:24,180 --> 02:28:27,950
is an expert and always knows the answer
yeah uh if we actually rewind to uh the

7900
02:28:27,950 --> 02:28:27,960
yeah uh if we actually rewind to uh the
 

7901
02:28:27,960 --> 02:28:29,389
yeah uh if we actually rewind to uh the
beginning of our conversation we talked

7902
02:28:29,389 --> 02:28:29,399
beginning of our conversation we talked
 

7903
02:28:29,399 --> 02:28:30,349
beginning of our conversation we talked
about

7904
02:28:30,349 --> 02:28:30,359
about
 

7905
02:28:30,359 --> 02:28:32,210
about
uh you mentioned something I wanted to

7906
02:28:32,210 --> 02:28:32,220
uh you mentioned something I wanted to
 

7907
02:28:32,220 --> 02:28:35,389
uh you mentioned something I wanted to
return to so there's a there's layers

7908
02:28:35,389 --> 02:28:35,399
return to so there's a there's layers
 

7909
02:28:35,399 --> 02:28:38,510
return to so there's a there's layers
that are uh there's an emergent novelty

7910
02:28:38,510 --> 02:28:38,520
that are uh there's an emergent novelty
 

7911
02:28:38,520 --> 02:28:40,309
that are uh there's an emergent novelty
and you mentioned that we as human

7912
02:28:40,309 --> 02:28:40,319
and you mentioned that we as human
 

7913
02:28:40,319 --> 02:28:43,130
and you mentioned that we as human
beings and we introspect and our own

7914

beings and we introspect and our own
 

7915
02:28:43,140 --> 02:28:46,910
beings and we introspect and our own
mind we really can't know most of it

7916

um which of course uh makes me think of

7918
02:28:49,429 --> 02:28:49,439
um which of course uh makes me think of
 

7919
02:28:49,439 --> 02:28:50,990
um which of course uh makes me think of
this uh the unconscious mind

7920
02:28:50,990 --> 02:28:51,000
this uh the unconscious mind
 

7921
02:28:51,000 --> 02:28:53,809
this uh the unconscious mind
subconscious mind uh and Carl Jung how

subconscious mind uh and Carl Jung how
much is hiding there in the shadows

7924
02:28:55,429 --> 02:28:55,439
much is hiding there in the shadows
 

7925
02:28:55,439 --> 02:28:58,130
much is hiding there in the shadows
you've you've uh investigated a lot of

7926
02:28:58,130 --> 02:28:58,140
you've you've uh investigated a lot of
 

7927
02:28:58,140 --> 02:29:00,290
you've you've uh investigated a lot of
uh trauma how much is there in our mind

uh trauma how much is there in our mind
 

7929
02:29:00,300 --> 02:29:03,349
uh trauma how much is there in our mind
that's not directly accessible to us

7930
02:29:03,349 --> 02:29:03,359
that's not directly accessible to us
 

7931
02:29:03,359 --> 02:29:04,849
that's not directly accessible to us
like what can you say maybe

7932
02:29:04,849 --> 02:29:04,859
like what can you say maybe
 

7933
02:29:04,859 --> 02:29:06,290
like what can you say maybe
philosophically

02:32:09,020 --> 02:32:12,010
young yes that there's some repressed
uh there's some stuff to work through

8092
02:32:12,010 --> 02:32:12,020
uh there's some stuff to work through
 

8093
02:32:12,020 --> 02:32:15,530
uh there's some stuff to work through
that is in uh the unconscious mind

8094
02:32:15,530 --> 02:32:15,540
that is in uh the unconscious mind
 

8095
02:32:15,540 --> 02:32:17,210
that is in uh the unconscious mind
yes I think there's

8096
02:32:17,210 --> 02:32:17,220
yes I think there's
 

8097
02:32:17,220 --> 02:32:19,790
yes I think there's
always like 100 percent

8098
02:32:19,790 --> 02:32:19,800
always like 100 percent
 

8099
02:32:19,800 --> 02:32:21,170
always like 100 percent
of the time if you have a living human

8100
02:32:21,170 --> 02:32:21,180
of the time if you have a living human
 

8101
02:32:21,180 --> 02:32:23,270
of the time if you have a living human
you have things to work through in the

8102
02:32:23,270 --> 02:32:23,280
you have things to work through in the
 

8103
02:32:23,280 --> 02:32:25,429
you have things to work through in the
unconscious mind right there's too much

8104
02:32:25,429 --> 02:32:25,439
unconscious mind right there's too much
 

8105
02:32:25,439 --> 02:32:27,170
unconscious mind right there's too much
that goes on around us that we might

8106
02:32:27,170 --> 02:32:27,180
that goes on around us that we might
 

8107
02:32:27,180 --> 02:32:30,110
that goes on around us that we might
find unacceptable and suppress right

8108
02:32:30,110 --> 02:32:30,120
find unacceptable and suppress right
 

8109
02:32:30,120 --> 02:32:31,550
find unacceptable and suppress right
there can be

8110
02:32:31,550 --> 02:32:31,560
there can be
 

8111
02:32:31,560 --> 02:32:33,830
there can be
smaller but important examples right

8112
02:32:33,830 --> 02:32:33,840
smaller but important examples right
 

8113
02:32:33,840 --> 02:32:35,809
smaller but important examples right
someone who

8114
02:32:35,809 --> 02:32:35,819
someone who
 

8115
02:32:35,819 --> 02:32:36,590
someone who
um

8116
02:32:36,590 --> 02:32:36,600
um
 

8117
02:32:36,600 --> 02:32:37,969
um
feels that they're not a good enough

8118
02:32:37,969 --> 02:32:37,979
feels that they're not a good enough
 

8119
02:32:37,979 --> 02:32:41,389
feels that they're not a good enough
parent and they I don't know they

8120
02:32:41,389 --> 02:32:41,399
parent and they I don't know they
 

8121
02:32:41,399 --> 02:32:45,410
parent and they I don't know they
dropped the child's plate right and

8122
02:32:45,410 --> 02:32:45,420
dropped the child's plate right and
 

8123
02:32:45,420 --> 02:32:46,429
dropped the child's plate right and
um

8124
02:32:46,429 --> 02:32:46,439
um
 

8125
02:32:46,439 --> 02:32:48,830
um
and there's a feeling about that of

8126
02:32:48,830 --> 02:32:48,840
and there's a feeling about that of
 

8127
02:32:48,840 --> 02:32:51,050
and there's a feeling about that of
Badness in them that the person that

8128
02:32:51,050 --> 02:32:51,060
Badness in them that the person that
 

8129
02:32:51,060 --> 02:32:53,630
Badness in them that the person that
can't tolerate and pushes away right and

8130
02:32:53,630 --> 02:32:53,640
can't tolerate and pushes away right and
 

8131
02:32:53,640 --> 02:32:55,070
can't tolerate and pushes away right and
maybe they become a little bit less

8132
02:32:55,070 --> 02:32:55,080
maybe they become a little bit less
 

8133
02:32:55,080 --> 02:32:56,630
maybe they become a little bit less
confident a little bit less assertive

8134
02:32:56,630 --> 02:32:56,640
confident a little bit less assertive
 

8135
02:32:56,640 --> 02:32:59,510
confident a little bit less assertive
like those small examples are important

8136
02:32:59,510 --> 02:32:59,520
like those small examples are important
 

8137
02:32:59,520 --> 02:33:01,370
like those small examples are important
because they may be low valence but

8138
02:33:01,370 --> 02:33:01,380
because they may be low valence but
 

8139
02:33:01,380 --> 02:33:02,389
because they may be low valence but
there can be many many many many many

8140
02:33:02,389 --> 02:33:02,399
there can be many many many many many
 

8141
02:33:02,399 --> 02:33:04,969
there can be many many many many many
many of them right then you can look at

8142
02:33:04,969 --> 02:33:04,979
many of them right then you can look at
 

8143
02:33:04,979 --> 02:33:06,469
many of them right then you can look at
the opposite end of the spectrum where

8144
02:33:06,469 --> 02:33:06,479
the opposite end of the spectrum where
 

8145
02:33:06,479 --> 02:33:08,929
the opposite end of the spectrum where
someone for example feels or they have

8146
02:33:08,929 --> 02:33:08,939
someone for example feels or they have
 

8147
02:33:08,939 --> 02:33:10,730
someone for example feels or they have
to they're repressing their sexuality

8148
02:33:10,730 --> 02:33:10,740
to they're repressing their sexuality
 

8149
02:33:10,740 --> 02:33:12,830
to they're repressing their sexuality
right unconsciously there's something

8150
02:33:12,830 --> 02:33:12,840
right unconsciously there's something
 

8151
02:33:12,840 --> 02:33:15,830
right unconsciously there's something
that is so important to say to how a

8152
02:33:15,830 --> 02:33:15,840
that is so important to say to how a
 

8153
02:33:15,840 --> 02:33:17,210
that is so important to say to how a
person feels about themselves to whether

8154
02:33:17,210 --> 02:33:17,220
person feels about themselves to whether
 

8155
02:33:17,220 --> 02:33:18,889
person feels about themselves to whether
they can seek fulfillment to how they

8156
02:33:18,889 --> 02:33:18,899
they can seek fulfillment to how they
 

8157
02:33:18,899 --> 02:33:21,050
they can seek fulfillment to how they
feel about their ability to interact and

8158
02:33:21,050 --> 02:33:21,060
feel about their ability to interact and
 

8159
02:33:21,060 --> 02:33:22,730
feel about their ability to interact and
engage with others in ways that are

8160
02:33:22,730 --> 02:33:22,740
engage with others in ways that are
 

8161
02:33:22,740 --> 02:33:25,370
engage with others in ways that are
loving and generative over time so so

8162
02:33:25,370 --> 02:33:25,380
loving and generative over time so so
 

8163
02:33:25,380 --> 02:33:28,010
loving and generative over time so so
from smaller things that accumulate

8164
02:33:28,010 --> 02:33:28,020
from smaller things that accumulate
 

8165
02:33:28,020 --> 02:33:30,170
from smaller things that accumulate
often at a rapid Pace to really big

8166
02:33:30,170 --> 02:33:30,180
often at a rapid Pace to really big
 

8167
02:33:30,180 --> 02:33:32,690
often at a rapid Pace to really big
things we are pushing things into the

8168
02:33:32,690 --> 02:33:32,700
things we are pushing things into the
 

8169
02:33:32,700 --> 02:33:34,150
things we are pushing things into the
unconscious because they're not

8170
02:33:34,150 --> 02:33:34,160
unconscious because they're not
 

8171
02:33:34,160 --> 02:33:36,710
unconscious because they're not
acceptable and we need to explore like

8172
02:33:36,710 --> 02:33:36,720
acceptable and we need to explore like
 

8173
02:33:36,720 --> 02:33:38,630
acceptable and we need to explore like
why is that not accept maybe there's an

8174
02:33:38,630 --> 02:33:38,640
why is that not accept maybe there's an
 

8175
02:33:38,640 --> 02:33:39,950
why is that not accept maybe there's an
unacceptable urge because it's really

8176
02:33:39,950 --> 02:33:39,960
unacceptable urge because it's really
 

8177
02:33:39,960 --> 02:33:41,750
unacceptable urge because it's really
not acceptable to me right like a

8178
02:33:41,750 --> 02:33:41,760
not acceptable to me right like a
 

8179
02:33:41,760 --> 02:33:43,370
not acceptable to me right like a
violent urge maybe there's an

8180
02:33:43,370 --> 02:33:43,380
violent urge maybe there's an
 

8181
02:33:43,380 --> 02:33:46,070
violent urge maybe there's an
unacceptable urge because I'm actually

8182
02:33:46,070 --> 02:33:46,080
unacceptable urge because I'm actually
 

8183

listening to the LIE Society is telling

8184
02:33:48,230 --> 02:33:48,240
listening to the LIE Society is telling
 

8185
02:33:48,240 --> 02:33:49,910
listening to the LIE Society is telling
me about what's okay and what's not okay

8186
02:33:49,910 --> 02:33:49,920
me about what's okay and what's not okay
 

8187
02:33:49,920 --> 02:33:53,030
me about what's okay and what's not okay
right so in exploring those things yes

8188
02:33:53,030 --> 02:33:53,040
right so in exploring those things yes
 

8189
02:33:53,040 --> 02:33:55,429
right so in exploring those things yes
we become happier and healthier and that

8190
02:33:55,429 --> 02:33:55,439
we become happier and healthier and that
 

8191
02:33:55,439 --> 02:33:56,990
we become happier and healthier and that
could mean if we're already happier and

8192
02:33:56,990 --> 02:33:57,000
could mean if we're already happier and
 

8193
02:33:57,000 --> 02:33:59,270
could mean if we're already happier and
happy and healthy it gets better we get

8194
02:33:59,270 --> 02:33:59,280
happy and healthy it gets better we get
 

8195
02:33:59,280 --> 02:34:01,550
happy and healthy it gets better we get
more insulated against the negative or

8196
02:34:01,550 --> 02:34:01,560
more insulated against the negative or
 

8197
02:34:01,560 --> 02:34:03,110
more insulated against the negative or
it can mean the person who's really

8198
02:34:03,110 --> 02:34:03,120
it can mean the person who's really
 

8199
02:34:03,120 --> 02:34:05,809
it can mean the person who's really
nurturing some of those seeds of of evil

8200
02:34:05,809 --> 02:34:05,819
nurturing some of those seeds of of evil
 

8201
02:34:05,819 --> 02:34:07,969
nurturing some of those seeds of of evil
and envy does that less or steps away

8202
02:34:07,969 --> 02:34:07,979
and envy does that less or steps away
 

8203
02:34:07,979 --> 02:34:10,309
and envy does that less or steps away
from it so whether it's good or it's bad

8204
02:34:10,309 --> 02:34:10,319
from it so whether it's good or it's bad
 

8205
02:34:10,319 --> 02:34:13,309
from it so whether it's good or it's bad
it's it's in there inside of us and we

8206
02:34:13,309 --> 02:34:13,319
it's it's in there inside of us and we
 

8207
02:34:13,319 --> 02:34:15,770
it's it's in there inside of us and we
benefit from understanding that idea of

8208
02:34:15,770 --> 02:34:15,780
benefit from understanding that idea of
 

8209
02:34:15,780 --> 02:34:17,389
benefit from understanding that idea of
the observing ego right like I said the

8210
02:34:17,389 --> 02:34:17,399
the observing ego right like I said the
 

8211
02:34:17,399 --> 02:34:19,309
the observing ego right like I said the
part that can stop and say hey this is

8212
02:34:19,309 --> 02:34:19,319
part that can stop and say hey this is
 

8213
02:34:19,319 --> 02:34:20,990
part that can stop and say hey this is
what's this is what I see what's going

8214
02:34:20,990 --> 02:34:21,000
what's this is what I see what's going
 

8215
02:34:21,000 --> 02:34:23,690
what's this is what I see what's going
on in me what have you learned about

8216
02:34:23,690 --> 02:34:23,700
on in me what have you learned about
 

8217
02:34:23,700 --> 02:34:25,910
on in me what have you learned about
exploring the human mind about the art

8218
02:34:25,910 --> 02:34:25,920
exploring the human mind about the art
 

8219
02:34:25,920 --> 02:34:27,230
exploring the human mind about the art
of conversation

8220
02:34:27,230 --> 02:34:27,240
of conversation
 

8221
02:34:27,240 --> 02:34:29,270
of conversation
is ultimately therapy's conversation

8222
02:34:29,270 --> 02:34:29,280
is ultimately therapy's conversation
 

8223
02:34:29,280 --> 02:34:30,349
is ultimately therapy's conversation
yeah

8224
02:34:30,349 --> 02:34:30,359
yeah
 

8225
02:34:30,359 --> 02:34:32,210
yeah
is there something you can put into

8226
02:34:32,210 --> 02:34:32,220
is there something you can put into
 

8227
02:34:32,220 --> 02:34:36,250
is there something you can put into
words yeah like what makes it a a good

8228
02:34:36,250 --> 02:34:36,260
words yeah like what makes it a a good
 

8229
02:34:36,260 --> 02:34:38,929
words yeah like what makes it a a good
conversation I think language is among

8230
02:34:38,929 --> 02:34:38,939
conversation I think language is among
 

8231
02:34:38,939 --> 02:34:42,230
conversation I think language is among
the most amazing gifts we have and it's

8232
02:34:42,230 --> 02:34:42,240
the most amazing gifts we have and it's
 

8233
02:34:42,240 --> 02:34:45,410
the most amazing gifts we have and it's
also one of the most like clunky routes

8234
02:34:45,410 --> 02:34:45,420
also one of the most like clunky routes
 

8235
02:34:45,420 --> 02:34:47,630
also one of the most like clunky routes
to misunderstanding right I think of

8236
02:34:47,630 --> 02:34:47,640
to misunderstanding right I think of
 

8237
02:34:47,640 --> 02:34:49,309
to misunderstanding right I think of
like there's a concept of facticity you

8238
02:34:49,309 --> 02:34:49,319
like there's a concept of facticity you
 

8239
02:34:49,319 --> 02:34:50,750
like there's a concept of facticity you
know things that are like I guess

8240
02:34:50,750 --> 02:34:50,760
know things that are like I guess
 

8241
02:34:50,760 --> 02:34:52,550
know things that are like I guess
necessary evils and from the religious

8242
02:34:52,550 --> 02:34:52,560
necessary evils and from the religious
 

8243
02:34:52,560 --> 02:34:53,809
necessary evils and from the religious
perspective I think is where the word

8244
02:34:53,809 --> 02:34:53,819
perspective I think is where the word
 

8245
02:34:53,819 --> 02:34:56,030
perspective I think is where the word
started but of language being like a

8246
02:34:56,030 --> 02:34:56,040
started but of language being like a

02:37:54,359 --> 02:37:56,570
right to uh accumulate to integrate to
make sense of their thoughts enough to

8404
02:37:56,570 --> 02:37:56,580
make sense of their thoughts enough to
 

8405
02:37:56,580 --> 02:37:59,090
make sense of their thoughts enough to
say a word maybe a memory is spark so

8406
02:37:59,090 --> 02:37:59,100
say a word maybe a memory is spark so
 

8407
02:37:59,100 --> 02:38:01,670
say a word maybe a memory is spark so
they can think about that memory and uh

8408
02:38:01,670 --> 02:38:01,680
they can think about that memory and uh
 

8409
02:38:01,680 --> 02:38:03,710
they can think about that memory and uh
like process that memory so it's not

8410
02:38:03,710 --> 02:38:03,720
like process that memory so it's not
 

8411
02:38:03,720 --> 02:38:05,210
like process that memory so it's not
just words sorry it's not just words

8412
02:38:05,210 --> 02:38:05,220
just words sorry it's not just words
 

8413
02:38:05,220 --> 02:38:06,110
just words sorry it's not just words
right because now you're talking about

8414
02:38:06,110 --> 02:38:06,120
right because now you're talking about
 

8415
02:38:06,120 --> 02:38:09,050
right because now you're talking about
communication as it's body language it's

8416
02:38:09,050 --> 02:38:09,060
communication as it's body language it's
 

8417
02:38:09,060 --> 02:38:11,030
communication as it's body language it's
you know it's expressions of empathy

8418
02:38:11,030 --> 02:38:11,040
you know it's expressions of empathy
 

8419
02:38:11,040 --> 02:38:13,250
you know it's expressions of empathy
it's movements it's pauses right like

8420
02:38:13,250 --> 02:38:13,260
it's movements it's pauses right like
 

8421
02:38:13,260 --> 02:38:16,070
it's movements it's pauses right like
the communication process is very very

8422
02:38:16,070 --> 02:38:16,080
the communication process is very very
 

8423
02:38:16,080 --> 02:38:19,790
the communication process is very very
complicated and and deep yeah and some

8424
02:38:19,790 --> 02:38:19,800
complicated and and deep yeah and some
 

8425
02:38:19,800 --> 02:38:21,410
complicated and and deep yeah and some
of that is building trust but also

8426
02:38:21,410 --> 02:38:21,420
of that is building trust but also
 

8427
02:38:21,420 --> 02:38:23,870
of that is building trust but also
challenging a person I wonder about that

8428
02:38:23,870 --> 02:38:23,880
challenging a person I wonder about that
 

8429
02:38:23,880 --> 02:38:26,090
challenging a person I wonder about that
whole process with uh with strangers for

8430
02:38:26,090 --> 02:38:26,100
whole process with uh with strangers for
 

8431
02:38:26,100 --> 02:38:27,309
whole process with uh with strangers for
example

8432
02:38:27,309 --> 02:38:27,319
example
 

8433
02:38:27,319 --> 02:38:30,050
example
uh how you do that successfully like you

8434
02:38:30,050 --> 02:38:30,060
uh how you do that successfully like you
 

8435
02:38:30,060 --> 02:38:32,170
uh how you do that successfully like you
and I just met uh today

8436
02:38:32,170 --> 02:38:32,180
and I just met uh today
 

8437
02:38:32,180 --> 02:38:34,790
and I just met uh today
but I think

8438
02:38:34,790 --> 02:38:34,800
but I think
 

8439
02:38:34,800 --> 02:38:37,550
but I think
a lot of our interaction is very free we

8440
02:38:37,550 --> 02:38:37,560
a lot of our interaction is very free we
 

8441
02:38:37,560 --> 02:38:39,110
a lot of our interaction is very free we
can get to know each other in any way we

8442
02:38:39,110 --> 02:38:39,120
can get to know each other in any way we
 

8443
02:38:39,120 --> 02:38:41,510
can get to know each other in any way we
want there's a few conversations that

8444
02:38:41,510 --> 02:38:41,520
want there's a few conversations that
 

8445

want there's a few conversations that
have coming up

8446

have coming up
in general where there's a lot of other

8448
02:38:44,270 --> 02:38:44,280
in general where there's a lot of other
 

8449
02:38:44,280 --> 02:38:46,070
in general where there's a lot of other
pressures and constraints on those

8450
02:38:46,070 --> 02:38:46,080

challenge a person about something and
they're totally okay with it but if you

8494
02:39:35,210 --> 02:39:35,220
they're totally okay with it but if you
 

8495
02:39:35,220 --> 02:39:37,309
they're totally okay with it but if you

childhood thing that their father mother
 

8501
02:39:41,220 --> 02:39:43,610
childhood thing that their father mother
used to say or something like this and

8502
02:39:43,610 --> 02:39:43,620
used to say or something like this and
 

8503
02:39:43,620 --> 02:39:45,830
used to say or something like this and
uh I mean part of the art of

8504
02:39:45,830 --> 02:39:45,840
uh I mean part of the art of
 

8505
02:39:45,840 --> 02:39:47,750
uh I mean part of the art of
conversation is actually

8506
02:39:47,750 --> 02:39:47,760
conversation is actually
 

8507
02:39:47,760 --> 02:39:49,849
conversation is actually
being a little bit free and using those

8508
02:39:49,849 --> 02:39:49,859
being a little bit free and using those
 

8509
02:39:49,859 --> 02:39:52,490
being a little bit free and using those
words but being extremely sensitive in

8510
02:39:52,490 --> 02:39:52,500
words but being extremely sensitive in
 

8511
02:39:52,500 --> 02:39:54,469
words but being extremely sensitive in
detecting when a person reacts to a

8512
02:39:54,469 --> 02:39:54,479
detecting when a person reacts to a
 

8513
02:39:54,479 --> 02:39:56,929
detecting when a person reacts to a
particular word and like storing that

8514
02:39:56,929 --> 02:39:56,939
particular word and like storing that
 

8515
02:39:56,939 --> 02:39:59,570
particular word and like storing that
away it's like okay then we might want

8516
02:39:59,570 --> 02:39:59,580
away it's like okay then we might want
 

8517
02:39:59,580 --> 02:40:01,309
away it's like okay then we might want
to return to that later

8518
02:40:01,309 --> 02:40:01,319
to return to that later
 

8519
02:40:01,319 --> 02:40:03,110
to return to that later
because there might be an interesting

8520
02:40:03,110 --> 02:40:03,120
because there might be an interesting
 

8521
02:40:03,120 --> 02:40:04,730
because there might be an interesting
that could be a tip of an iceberg that's

8522
02:40:04,730 --> 02:40:04,740
that could be a tip of an iceberg that's
 

8523
02:40:04,740 --> 02:40:05,750
that could be a tip of an iceberg that's
actually representing something

8524
02:40:05,750 --> 02:40:05,760
actually representing something
 

8525
02:40:05,760 --> 02:40:08,630
actually representing something
beautiful or you might want to just it's

8526
02:40:08,630 --> 02:40:08,640
beautiful or you might want to just it's
 

8527
02:40:08,640 --> 02:40:10,550
beautiful or you might want to just it's
a nothing word that you just want to

8528
02:40:10,550 --> 02:40:10,560
a nothing word that you just want to
 

8529
02:40:10,560 --> 02:40:13,250
a nothing word that you just want to
avoid because it's a distraction and so

8530
02:40:13,250 --> 02:40:13,260
avoid because it's a distraction and so
 

8531
02:40:13,260 --> 02:40:14,929
avoid because it's a distraction and so
all of that kind of has to be integrated

8532
02:40:14,929 --> 02:40:14,939
all of that kind of has to be integrated
 

8533
02:40:14,939 --> 02:40:16,670
all of that kind of has to be integrated
into the dance of language this is

8534
02:40:16,670 --> 02:40:16,680
into the dance of language this is
 

8535
02:40:16,680 --> 02:40:18,410
into the dance of language this is
really interesting especially when the

8536
02:40:18,410 --> 02:40:18,420
really interesting especially when the
 

8537
02:40:18,420 --> 02:40:19,849
really interesting especially when the
stakes are really high when you get one

8538
02:40:19,849 --> 02:40:19,859
stakes are really high when you get one
 

8539
02:40:19,859 --> 02:40:22,670
stakes are really high when you get one
conversation right we have when you sit

8540
02:40:22,670 --> 02:40:22,680
conversation right we have when you sit
 

8541
02:40:22,680 --> 02:40:24,770
conversation right we have when you sit
down you have one conversation and it

8542
02:40:24,770 --> 02:40:24,780
down you have one conversation and it
 

8543
02:40:24,780 --> 02:40:25,670
down you have one conversation and it
makes

8544
02:40:25,670 --> 02:40:25,680
makes
 

8545
02:40:25,680 --> 02:40:27,950
makes
the difference between like say you had

8546
02:40:27,950 --> 02:40:27,960
the difference between like say you had
 

8547
02:40:27,960 --> 02:40:29,690
the difference between like say you had
one conversation with a patient this is

8548
02:40:29,690 --> 02:40:29,700
one conversation with a patient this is
 

8549
02:40:29,700 --> 02:40:31,429
one conversation with a patient this is
the only conversation you get to help

8550
02:40:31,429 --> 02:40:31,439
the only conversation you get to help
 

8551
02:40:31,439 --> 02:40:33,889
the only conversation you get to help
sometimes it is the case yeah and like

8552
02:40:33,889 --> 02:40:33,899
sometimes it is the case yeah and like
 

8553
02:40:33,899 --> 02:40:38,690
sometimes it is the case yeah and like
this is pretty high stakes yeah oh man

8554
02:40:38,690 --> 02:40:38,700
this is pretty high stakes yeah oh man
 

8555
02:40:38,700 --> 02:40:41,150
this is pretty high stakes yeah oh man
yeah it's tough I guess you get over

8556
02:40:41,150 --> 02:40:41,160
yeah it's tough I guess you get over
 

8557
02:40:41,160 --> 02:40:45,110
yeah it's tough I guess you get over
um and like over time I guess you get uh

8558
02:40:45,110 --> 02:40:45,120
um and like over time I guess you get uh
 

8559
02:40:45,120 --> 02:40:47,870
um and like over time I guess you get uh
used to the the high stakes nature of it

8560
02:40:47,870 --> 02:40:47,880
used to the the high stakes nature of it
 

8561
02:40:47,880 --> 02:40:50,450
used to the the high stakes nature of it
when you develop an ability and all that

on skills processing right right right
all that part of the iceberg that's

8566
02:40:54,349 --> 02:40:54,359
all that part of the iceberg that's
 

8567
02:40:54,359 --> 02:40:55,969
all that part of the iceberg that's
underneath the surface is doing all of

8568
02:40:55,969 --> 02:40:55,979
underneath the surface is doing all of
 

8569
02:40:55,979 --> 02:40:57,469
underneath the surface is doing all of
that right is reading you know

8570
02:40:57,469 --> 02:40:57,479
that right is reading you know
 

8571
02:40:57,479 --> 02:40:59,570
that right is reading you know
behavioral cues verbal cues and and

8572
02:40:59,570 --> 02:40:59,580
behavioral cues verbal cues and and
 

8573
02:40:59,580 --> 02:41:02,690
behavioral cues verbal cues and and
recognizing the Primacy of emotion over

02:41:02,690 --> 02:41:02,700
recognizing the Primacy of emotion over
 

8575
02:41:02,700 --> 02:41:05,630
recognizing the Primacy of emotion over
logic right if it were all logic it'd be

8576
02:41:05,630 --> 02:41:05,640
logic right if it were all logic it'd be
 

8577
02:41:05,640 --> 02:41:06,530
logic right if it were all logic it'd be
different okay we're gonna talk about

8578
02:41:06,530 --> 02:41:06,540
different okay we're gonna talk about
 

8579
02:41:06,540 --> 02:41:07,910
different okay we're gonna talk about
this thing I'll say things you say

8580
02:41:07,910 --> 02:41:07,920
this thing I'll say things you say
 

8581
02:41:07,920 --> 02:41:09,889
this thing I'll say things you say
things back even if it's politically

8582
02:41:09,889 --> 02:41:09,899
things back even if it's politically
 

8583
02:41:09,899 --> 02:41:11,389
things back even if it's politically
contentious sex okay we're just going to

8584
02:41:11,389 --> 02:41:11,399
contentious sex okay we're just going to
 

8585
02:41:11,399 --> 02:41:13,070
contentious sex okay we're just going to
talk logically but you know that's not

8586
02:41:13,070 --> 02:41:13,080
talk logically but you know that's not
 

8587
02:41:13,080 --> 02:41:15,830
talk logically but you know that's not
the case right there could be a word

8588
02:41:15,830 --> 02:41:15,840
the case right there could be a word
 

8589
02:41:15,840 --> 02:41:17,750
the case right there could be a word
that raises a certain emotion and you

8590
02:41:17,750 --> 02:41:17,760
that raises a certain emotion and you
 

8591
02:41:17,760 --> 02:41:18,889
that raises a certain emotion and you
know you don't want to tread there

8592
02:41:18,889 --> 02:41:18,899
know you don't want to tread there
 

8593
02:41:18,899 --> 02:41:20,570
know you don't want to tread there
because the emotion will color the

8594
02:41:20,570 --> 02:41:20,580
because the emotion will color the
 

8595
02:41:20,580 --> 02:41:23,030
because the emotion will color the
person's ability to engage and so you're

8596
02:41:23,030 --> 02:41:23,040
person's ability to engage and so you're
 

8597
02:41:23,040 --> 02:41:25,370
person's ability to engage and so you're
aware of all of this and then I think

8598
02:41:25,370 --> 02:41:25,380
aware of all of this and then I think
 

8599
02:41:25,380 --> 02:41:27,469
aware of all of this and then I think
from the perspective of all of that I

8600
02:41:27,469 --> 02:41:27,479
from the perspective of all of that I
 

8601
02:41:27,479 --> 02:41:29,570
from the perspective of all of that I
mean it's like standing on the shoulders

8602
02:41:29,570 --> 02:41:29,580
mean it's like standing on the shoulders
 

8603
02:41:29,580 --> 02:41:32,030
mean it's like standing on the shoulders
of your own internal giant right that

8604
02:41:32,030 --> 02:41:32,040
of your own internal giant right that
 

8605
02:41:32,040 --> 02:41:34,309
of your own internal giant right that
understands you know language and

8606
02:41:34,309 --> 02:41:34,319
understands you know language and
 

8607
02:41:34,319 --> 02:41:36,349
understands you know language and
emotions and body language and

8608
02:41:36,349 --> 02:41:36,359
emotions and body language and
 

8609
02:41:36,359 --> 02:41:39,290
emotions and body language and
Attunement to end history and triggering

8610
02:41:39,290 --> 02:41:39,300
Attunement to end history and triggering
 

8611
02:41:39,300 --> 02:41:41,630
Attunement to end history and triggering
and all of that and then on top of that

8612
02:41:41,630 --> 02:41:41,640
and all of that and then on top of that
 

8613
02:41:41,640 --> 02:41:43,429
and all of that and then on top of that
as you're standing up on those shoulders

8614
02:41:43,429 --> 02:41:43,439
as you're standing up on those shoulders
 

8615
02:41:43,439 --> 02:41:45,830
as you're standing up on those shoulders
you're trying to be effective right and

8616
02:41:45,830 --> 02:41:45,840
you're trying to be effective right and
 

8617
02:41:45,840 --> 02:41:47,750
you're trying to be effective right and
then I think that's where you know

8618
02:41:47,750 --> 02:41:47,760
then I think that's where you know
 

8619
02:41:47,760 --> 02:41:50,450
then I think that's where you know
Effectiveness can be unilateral or it

8620
02:41:50,450 --> 02:41:50,460
Effectiveness can be unilateral or it
 

8621
02:41:50,460 --> 02:41:52,250
Effectiveness can be unilateral or it
can be together I mean I think some of

8622
02:41:52,250 --> 02:41:52,260
can be together I mean I think some of
 

8623
02:41:52,260 --> 02:41:53,510
can be together I mean I think some of
what emerged

8624
02:41:53,510 --> 02:41:53,520
what emerged
 

8625
02:41:53,520 --> 02:41:55,370
what emerged
from Victor Frankel's writing after the

8626
02:41:55,370 --> 02:41:55,380
from Victor Frankel's writing after the
 

8627
02:41:55,380 --> 02:41:58,910
from Victor Frankel's writing after the
second world war was how much a shared

8628
02:41:58,910 --> 02:41:58,920
second world war was how much a shared
 

8629
02:41:58,920 --> 02:42:01,370
second world war was how much a shared
humanness means to us how much of that

8630
02:42:01,370 --> 02:42:01,380
humanness means to us how much of that
 

8631
02:42:01,380 --> 02:42:04,190
humanness means to us how much of that
can be an incentive for survival beyond

8632
02:42:04,190 --> 02:42:04,200
can be an incentive for survival beyond
 

8633
02:42:04,200 --> 02:42:07,010
can be an incentive for survival beyond
all others right so so the idea of are

8634
02:42:07,010 --> 02:42:07,020
all others right so so the idea of are
 

8635
02:42:07,020 --> 02:42:08,389
all others right so so the idea of are
we doing something if we're

8636
02:42:08,389 --> 02:42:08,399
we doing something if we're
 

8637
02:42:08,399 --> 02:42:10,790
we doing something if we're
communicating unilateral like I want

8638
02:42:10,790 --> 02:42:10,800
communicating unilateral like I want
 

8639
02:42:10,800 --> 02:42:13,790
communicating unilateral like I want
information from you or I want you to do

8640
02:42:13,790 --> 02:42:13,800
information from you or I want you to do
 

8641
02:42:13,800 --> 02:42:15,469
information from you or I want you to do
a certain thing when we're done talking

8642
02:42:15,469 --> 02:42:15,479
a certain thing when we're done talking
 

8643
02:42:15,479 --> 02:42:17,570
a certain thing when we're done talking
right right it can be done communicating

8644
02:42:17,570 --> 02:42:17,580
right right it can be done communicating
 

8645
02:42:17,580 --> 02:42:19,910
right right it can be done communicating
that's a very unilateral type of

8646
02:42:19,910 --> 02:42:19,920
that's a very unilateral type of
 

8647
02:42:19,920 --> 02:42:21,770
that's a very unilateral type of
Effectiveness which can make sense

8648
02:42:21,770 --> 02:42:21,780
Effectiveness which can make sense
 

8649
02:42:21,780 --> 02:42:23,270
Effectiveness which can make sense
sometimes I want information out of a

8650
02:42:23,270 --> 02:42:23,280
sometimes I want information out of a
 

8651
02:42:23,280 --> 02:42:24,410
sometimes I want information out of a
patient because I want to know what to

8652
02:42:24,410 --> 02:42:24,420
patient because I want to know what to
 

8653
02:42:24,420 --> 02:42:25,730
patient because I want to know what to
do next right so it doesn't have to

8654
02:42:25,730 --> 02:42:25,740
do next right so it doesn't have to
 

8655
02:42:25,740 --> 02:42:27,950
do next right so it doesn't have to
always be negative but it can also be a

8656
02:42:27,950 --> 02:42:27,960
always be negative but it can also be a
 

8657
02:42:27,960 --> 02:42:29,750
always be negative but it can also be a
tool of manipulation right if someone

8658
02:42:29,750 --> 02:42:29,760
tool of manipulation right if someone
 

8659
02:42:29,760 --> 02:42:31,550
tool of manipulation right if someone
would say coming from Envy or narcissism

8660
02:42:31,550 --> 02:42:31,560
would say coming from Envy or narcissism
 

8661

do right different from that is where
 

8667
02:42:38,100 --> 02:42:40,490
do right different from that is where
it's a shared communication where you

8668
02:42:40,490 --> 02:42:40,500
it's a shared communication where you
 

8669
02:42:40,500 --> 02:42:41,870
it's a shared communication where you
know there's like an umbrella so to

speak over us and we're doing something
 

8673
02:42:44,100 --> 02:42:45,650
speak over us and we're doing something
that we can all that can only happen

8674
02:42:45,650 --> 02:42:45,660
that we can all that can only happen
 

8675
02:42:45,660 --> 02:42:47,809
that we can all that can only happen
together because we're us we're the each

something that's a shared Effectiveness
 

8681
02:42:51,899 --> 02:42:53,929
something that's a shared Effectiveness
like I think we're doing now like

8682
02:42:53,929 --> 02:42:53,939
like I think we're doing now like
 

8683
02:42:53,939 --> 02:42:56,210
like I think we're doing now like
elucidating and pursuing thoughts and

8684
02:42:56,210 --> 02:42:56,220
elucidating and pursuing thoughts and
 

8685
02:42:56,220 --> 02:42:58,670
elucidating and pursuing thoughts and
getting ideas out and I think the best

getting ideas out and I think the best
 

8687
02:42:58,680 --> 02:43:00,650
getting ideas out and I think the best
situations are shared Effectiveness

8688
02:43:00,650 --> 02:43:00,660
situations are shared Effectiveness
 

8689
02:43:00,660 --> 02:43:02,450
situations are shared Effectiveness
situations because you call upon the

8801
02:45:06,060 --> 02:45:10,030
it was
almost a profound reinvention of

02:46:13,460 --> 02:46:15,830
shared humanness that creates a meaning
beyond the transaction kind of like you

8850
02:46:15,830 --> 02:46:15,840
beyond the transaction kind of like you
 

8851
02:46:15,840 --> 02:46:17,750
beyond the transaction kind of like you
were just saying The Logical stuff isn't

8852
02:46:17,750 --> 02:46:17,760
were just saying The Logical stuff isn't
 

8853
02:46:17,760 --> 02:46:20,090
were just saying The Logical stuff isn't
really that interesting because you know

8854
02:46:20,090 --> 02:46:20,100
really that interesting because you know
 

8855
02:46:20,100 --> 02:46:21,710
really that interesting because you know
the logic is there's an answer to

8856
02:46:21,710 --> 02:46:21,720
the logic is there's an answer to
 

8857
02:46:21,720 --> 02:46:23,450
the logic is there's an answer to
whatever logic is we can do math right

8858
02:46:23,450 --> 02:46:23,460
whatever logic is we can do math right
 

8859
02:46:23,460 --> 02:46:26,389
whatever logic is we can do math right
it's it's where does the the surprises

8860
02:46:26,389 --> 02:46:26,399
it's it's where does the the surprises
 

8861
02:46:26,399 --> 02:46:29,570
it's it's where does the the surprises
come in right either in terms of of

8862
02:46:29,570 --> 02:46:29,580
come in right either in terms of of
 

8863
02:46:29,580 --> 02:46:31,670
come in right either in terms of of
wonderful Behavior or destructive

8864
02:46:31,670 --> 02:46:31,680
wonderful Behavior or destructive
 

8865
02:46:31,680 --> 02:46:32,809
wonderful Behavior or destructive
Behavior right they're coming from

Behavior right they're coming from
 

8867
02:46:32,819 --> 02:46:35,450
Behavior right they're coming from
people's emotions so that's what we want

8868
02:46:35,450 --> 02:46:35,460
people's emotions so that's what we want
 

8869
02:46:35,460 --> 02:46:37,670
people's emotions so that's what we want
to understand and that occurs in the

8870
02:46:37,670 --> 02:46:37,680
to understand and that occurs in the
 

8871
02:46:37,680 --> 02:46:40,250
to understand and that occurs in the
context of a person and other humans you

8872
02:46:40,250 --> 02:46:40,260
context of a person and other humans you
 

8873
02:46:40,260 --> 02:46:41,750
context of a person and other humans you

02:49:36,889 --> 02:49:36,899
whether it's berries or it's humans who
 

9029
02:49:36,899 --> 02:49:38,570
whether it's berries or it's humans who
might threaten us or it's humans we love

9030
02:49:38,570 --> 02:49:38,580
might threaten us or it's humans we love
 

9031
02:49:38,580 --> 02:49:41,809
might threaten us or it's humans we love
I I think it's it's hard to to even look

9032
02:49:41,809 --> 02:49:41,819
I I think it's it's hard to to even look
 

9033
02:49:41,819 --> 02:49:43,670
I I think it's it's hard to to even look
at the anthropological psychological

9034
02:49:43,670 --> 02:49:43,680
at the anthropological psychological
 

9035
02:49:43,680 --> 02:49:45,530
at the anthropological psychological
literature to look at what's out there

9036
02:49:45,530 --> 02:49:45,540
literature to look at what's out there
 

9037
02:49:45,540 --> 02:49:47,990
literature to look at what's out there
and I think the face validity not to

9038
02:49:47,990 --> 02:49:48,000
and I think the face validity not to
 

9039
02:49:48,000 --> 02:49:50,090
and I think the face validity not to
that that's part of survival right it's

9040
02:49:50,090 --> 02:49:50,100
that that's part of survival right it's
 

9041
02:49:50,100 --> 02:49:52,309
that that's part of survival right it's
part of survival it's so cool that you

9042
02:49:52,309 --> 02:49:52,319
part of survival it's so cool that you
 

9043
02:49:52,319 --> 02:49:54,650
part of survival it's so cool that you
get also things like love which are not

9044
02:49:54,650 --> 02:49:54,660
get also things like love which are not
 

9045
02:49:54,660 --> 02:49:57,349
get also things like love which are not
often rational or grounded in logic and

9046
02:49:57,349 --> 02:49:57,359
often rational or grounded in logic and
 

9047
02:49:57,359 --> 02:49:59,150
often rational or grounded in logic and
so on if you if you look like sort of

9048
02:49:59,150 --> 02:49:59,160
so on if you if you look like sort of
 

9049
02:49:59,160 --> 02:50:01,670
so on if you if you look like sort of
from a transactional perspective

9050
02:50:01,670 --> 02:50:01,680
from a transactional perspective
 

9051
02:50:01,680 --> 02:50:04,690
from a transactional perspective
a lot of times falling in love or

9052
02:50:04,690 --> 02:50:04,700
a lot of times falling in love or
 

9053
02:50:04,700 --> 02:50:07,429
a lot of times falling in love or
whether it's with friends or uh

9054
02:50:07,429 --> 02:50:07,439
whether it's with friends or uh
 

9055
02:50:07,439 --> 02:50:09,830
whether it's with friends or uh
friendship or romantic love it doesn't

9056
02:50:09,830 --> 02:50:09,840
friendship or romantic love it doesn't
 

9057
02:50:09,840 --> 02:50:12,290
friendship or romantic love it doesn't
really make sense I'm still don't I'm

9058
02:50:12,290 --> 02:50:12,300
really make sense I'm still don't I'm
 

9059

is because like I mean it uh it's the

9062

is because like I mean it uh it's the
 

9063
02:50:18,060 --> 02:50:20,510
is because like I mean it uh it's the
thing that it's one of the things or

9064
02:50:20,510 --> 02:50:20,520
thing that it's one of the things or
 

9065

9075
02:50:32,700 --> 02:50:35,690
get to have like if you're looking for
the in the menu of items they give life

9076
02:50:35,690 --> 02:50:35,700
the in the menu of items they give life
 

9077
02:50:35,700 --> 02:50:37,190
the in the menu of items they give life
meaning that seems like a pretty good

9078
02:50:37,190 --> 02:50:37,200
meaning that seems like a pretty good
 

9079
02:50:37,200 --> 02:50:41,090
meaning that seems like a pretty good
one yeah so my response you said that

9080
02:50:41,090 --> 02:50:41,100
one yeah so my response you said that
 

9081
02:50:41,100 --> 02:50:43,070
one yeah so my response you said that
Gives Life Meaning my response initially

9082
02:50:43,070 --> 02:50:43,080
Gives Life Meaning my response initially
 

9083
02:50:43,080 --> 02:50:44,929
Gives Life Meaning my response initially
was going to be it's the meaning of life

9084
02:50:44,929 --> 02:50:44,939
was going to be it's the meaning of life
 

9085
02:50:44,939 --> 02:50:47,210
was going to be it's the meaning of life
right because saying okay emotion is

9086
02:50:47,210 --> 02:50:47,220
right because saying okay emotion is
 

9087
02:50:47,220 --> 02:50:49,190
right because saying okay emotion is
about survival that's one part right

9088
02:50:49,190 --> 02:50:49,200
about survival that's one part right
 

9089
02:50:49,200 --> 02:50:50,750
about survival that's one part right
that's and it's a very important part

9090
02:50:50,750 --> 02:50:50,760
that's and it's a very important part
 

9091
02:50:50,760 --> 02:50:53,389
that's and it's a very important part
right if we don't survive then then

9092
02:50:53,389 --> 02:50:53,399
right if we don't survive then then
 

9093
02:50:53,399 --> 02:50:54,889
right if we don't survive then then
we're not there to have emotions right

9094
02:50:54,889 --> 02:50:54,899
we're not there to have emotions right
 

9095
02:50:54,899 --> 02:50:58,130
we're not there to have emotions right
so yes it's about survival but as

9096
02:50:58,130 --> 02:50:58,140
so yes it's about survival but as
 

9097
02:50:58,140 --> 02:50:59,450
so yes it's about survival but as
important as that is that's the small

9098
02:50:59,450 --> 02:50:59,460
important as that is that's the small
 

9099
02:50:59,460 --> 02:51:02,210
important as that is that's the small
part of it right I think it is about the

9100
02:51:02,210 --> 02:51:02,220
part of it right I think it is about the
 

9101
02:51:02,220 --> 02:51:04,010
part of it right I think it is about the
meaning of life because it's about the

9102
02:51:04,010 --> 02:51:04,020
meaning of life because it's about the
 

9103
02:51:04,020 --> 02:51:06,230
meaning of life because it's about the
Beyond self and I think it relates back

9104
02:51:06,230 --> 02:51:06,240
Beyond self and I think it relates back
 

9105
02:51:06,240 --> 02:51:08,150
Beyond self and I think it relates back
to what we talked we're talking about

9106
02:51:08,150 --> 02:51:08,160
to what we talked we're talking about
 

9107
02:51:08,160 --> 02:51:09,710
to what we talked we're talking about
the very beginning and the sort of

9108
02:51:09,710 --> 02:51:09,720
the very beginning and the sort of
 

9109
02:51:09,720 --> 02:51:12,770
the very beginning and the sort of
levels of emergence right and when we

9110
02:51:12,770 --> 02:51:12,780
levels of emergence right and when we
 

9111
02:51:12,780 --> 02:51:15,290
levels of emergence right and when we
feel love we feel happiness because that

9112
02:51:15,290 --> 02:51:15,300
feel love we feel happiness because that
 

9113
02:51:15,300 --> 02:51:17,929
feel love we feel happiness because that
person feels happiness right there's

9114
02:51:17,929 --> 02:51:17,939
person feels happiness right there's
 

9115
02:51:17,939 --> 02:51:19,550
person feels happiness right there's
something that's so generative so

9116
02:51:19,550 --> 02:51:19,560
something that's so generative so
 

9117
02:51:19,560 --> 02:51:21,349
something that's so generative so
creative about that like we we want to

9118
02:51:21,349 --> 02:51:21,359
creative about that like we we want to
 

9119
02:51:21,359 --> 02:51:23,330
creative about that like we we want to
bring order to things and we we you know

9120
02:51:23,330 --> 02:51:23,340
bring order to things and we we you know
 

9121
02:51:23,340 --> 02:51:25,730
bring order to things and we we you know
happiness is consistent with Simplicity

9122
02:51:25,730 --> 02:51:25,740
happiness is consistent with Simplicity
 

9123
02:51:25,740 --> 02:51:27,170
happiness is consistent with Simplicity
right if we're healthy there's nothing

9124
02:51:27,170 --> 02:51:27,180
right if we're healthy there's nothing
 

9125
02:51:27,180 --> 02:51:28,610
right if we're healthy there's nothing
negative to say about our health right

9126
02:51:28,610 --> 02:51:28,620
negative to say about our health right
 

9127
02:51:28,620 --> 02:51:30,050
negative to say about our health right
if we have health problems there's a lot

9128
02:51:30,050 --> 02:51:30,060
if we have health problems there's a lot
 

9129
02:51:30,060 --> 02:51:33,110
if we have health problems there's a lot
to say right and it's it's emotion that

9130
02:51:33,110 --> 02:51:33,120
to say right and it's it's emotion that
 

9131
02:51:33,120 --> 02:51:35,510
to say right and it's it's emotion that
pushes us towards the the goodness that

9132
02:51:35,510 --> 02:51:35,520
pushes us towards the the goodness that
 

9133
02:51:35,520 --> 02:51:38,210
pushes us towards the the goodness that
I think makes all the meaning for us I

9134
02:51:38,210 --> 02:51:38,220
I think makes all the meaning for us I
 

9135
02:51:38,220 --> 02:51:39,830
I think makes all the meaning for us I
mean it's interesting I actually I was

9136
02:51:39,830 --> 02:51:39,840
mean it's interesting I actually I was
 

9137
02:51:39,840 --> 02:51:41,330
mean it's interesting I actually I was
wondering your your thoughts about this

9138
02:51:41,330 --> 02:51:41,340
wondering your your thoughts about this
 

9139
02:51:41,340 --> 02:51:43,670
wondering your your thoughts about this
as a scientist right because we we

9140
02:51:43,670 --> 02:51:43,680
as a scientist right because we we
 

9141
02:51:43,680 --> 02:51:45,469
as a scientist right because we we
accept it by and large that we have free

9142
02:51:45,469 --> 02:51:45,479
accept it by and large that we have free
 

9143
02:51:45,479 --> 02:51:47,389
accept it by and large that we have free
will right we deal with free will but

9144
02:51:47,389 --> 02:51:47,399
will right we deal with free will but
 

9145
02:51:47,399 --> 02:51:48,650
will right we deal with free will but
then we get upset that there's not

9146
02:51:48,650 --> 02:51:48,660
then we get upset that there's not
 

9147
02:51:48,660 --> 02:51:51,230
then we get upset that there's not
Justice right so but how is it like if

9148
02:51:51,230 --> 02:51:51,240
Justice right so but how is it like if
 

9149
02:51:51,240 --> 02:51:53,269
Justice right so but how is it like if
we have free will I could act in an

9150
02:51:53,269 --> 02:51:53,279
we have free will I could act in an
 

9151
02:51:53,279 --> 02:51:55,370
we have free will I could act in an
unjust way and then you're surprised or

9152
02:51:55,370 --> 02:51:55,380
unjust way and then you're surprised or
 

9153
02:51:55,380 --> 02:51:57,349
unjust way and then you're surprised or
you know Vice versa's like why right we

9154
02:51:57,349 --> 02:51:57,359
you know Vice versa's like why right we
 

9155
02:51:57,359 --> 02:51:59,809
you know Vice versa's like why right we
we have these thoughts because I think

9156
02:51:59,809 --> 02:51:59,819
we have these thoughts because I think
 

9157
02:51:59,819 --> 02:52:02,690
we have these thoughts because I think
because we're we're rooted we want logic

9158
02:52:02,690 --> 02:52:02,700
because we're we're rooted we want logic
 

9159
02:52:02,700 --> 02:52:04,130
because we're we're rooted we want logic
to rule like there's a way which I can

9160
02:52:04,130 --> 02:52:04,140
to rule like there's a way which I can
 

9161
02:52:04,140 --> 02:52:05,809
to rule like there's a way which I can
understand logic I can manage it I can

9162
02:52:05,809 --> 02:52:05,819
understand logic I can manage it I can
 

9163
02:52:05,819 --> 02:52:08,030
understand logic I can manage it I can
manipulate it we sort of want it to be

9164
02:52:08,030 --> 02:52:08,040
manipulate it we sort of want it to be
 

9165
02:52:08,040 --> 02:52:12,950
manipulate it we sort of want it to be
that way so then we we glorify logic and

9166
02:52:12,950 --> 02:52:12,960
that way so then we we glorify logic and
 

9167
02:52:12,960 --> 02:52:15,410
that way so then we we glorify logic and
then we misapply it like ideas like oh I

9168
02:52:15,410 --> 02:52:15,420
then we misapply it like ideas like oh I
 

9169
02:52:15,420 --> 02:52:17,870
then we misapply it like ideas like oh I
know we have free will but I'm now you

9170
02:52:17,870 --> 02:52:17,880
know we have free will but I'm now you
 

9171
02:52:17,880 --> 02:52:19,309
know we have free will but I'm now you
know shaking my fist at the heavens

9172
02:52:19,309 --> 02:52:19,319
know shaking my fist at the heavens
 

9173
02:52:19,319 --> 02:52:21,650
know shaking my fist at the heavens
because there's no justice right and I

9174
02:52:21,650 --> 02:52:21,660
because there's no justice right and I
 

9175
02:52:21,660 --> 02:52:24,170
because there's no justice right and I
think maybe what we're looking for is we

9176
02:52:24,170 --> 02:52:24,180
think maybe what we're looking for is we
 

9177
02:52:24,180 --> 02:52:25,490
think maybe what we're looking for is we
should go back and look at the Givens

9178
02:52:25,490 --> 02:52:25,500
should go back and look at the Givens
 

9179
02:52:25,500 --> 02:52:27,050
should go back and look at the Givens
like why is there there's only goodness

9180
02:52:27,050 --> 02:52:27,060
like why is there there's only goodness
 

9181
02:52:27,060 --> 02:52:28,610
like why is there there's only goodness
if there's Justice I mean that doesn't

9182
02:52:28,610 --> 02:52:28,620
if there's Justice I mean that doesn't
 

9183
02:52:28,620 --> 02:52:31,429
if there's Justice I mean that doesn't
make I I think the goodness why is the

9184
02:52:31,429 --> 02:52:31,439
make I I think the goodness why is the
 

9185
02:52:31,439 --> 02:52:32,809
make I I think the goodness why is the
goodness have to be tied to that right

9186
02:52:32,809 --> 02:52:32,819
goodness have to be tied to that right
 

9187
02:52:32,819 --> 02:52:34,790
goodness have to be tied to that right
maybe it goes back to the counter

9188
02:52:34,790 --> 02:52:34,800
maybe it goes back to the counter
 

9189
02:52:34,800 --> 02:52:36,769
maybe it goes back to the counter
entropy and the fact that when there is

9190
02:52:36,769 --> 02:52:36,779
entropy and the fact that when there is
 

9191
02:52:36,779 --> 02:52:38,870
entropy and the fact that when there is
something there is not nothing right and

9192
02:52:38,870 --> 02:52:38,880
something there is not nothing right and
 

9193
02:52:38,880 --> 02:52:40,190
something there is not nothing right and
where there is something there can be

02:52:40,190 --> 02:52:40,200
where there is something there can be
 

9195
02:52:40,200 --> 02:52:42,710
where there is something there can be
awareness there can be goodness there

9196
02:52:42,710 --> 02:52:42,720
awareness there can be goodness there
 

9197
02:52:42,720 --> 02:52:45,889
awareness there can be goodness there
can be compassion right is it that that

9198
02:52:45,889 --> 02:52:45,899
can be compassion right is it that that
 

9199
02:52:45,899 --> 02:52:48,290
can be compassion right is it that that
that what's really going on is not about

9200
02:52:48,290 --> 02:52:48,300
that what's really going on is not about
 

9201
02:52:48,300 --> 02:52:51,290
that what's really going on is not about
Justice yes we have free will but it's

9202
02:52:51,290 --> 02:52:51,300
Justice yes we have free will but it's
 

9203
02:52:51,300 --> 02:52:55,550
Justice yes we have free will but it's
that goodness creating Shoring up making

02:52:55,550 --> 02:52:55,560
that goodness creating Shoring up making
 

9205
02:52:55,560 --> 02:52:59,269
that goodness creating Shoring up making
better that is

9206
02:52:59,269 --> 02:52:59,279
better that is
 

9207
02:52:59,279 --> 02:53:01,969
better that is
the meaning that is the good right and

9208
02:53:01,969 --> 02:53:01,979
the meaning that is the good right and
 

9209
02:53:01,979 --> 02:53:04,670
the meaning that is the good right and
that the evil is the destruction as

9210
02:53:04,670 --> 02:53:04,680
that the evil is the destruction as
 

9211
02:53:04,680 --> 02:53:06,769
that the evil is the destruction as
evidenced by the fact that it's over

9215
02:53:08,700 --> 02:53:10,309
determined probably a million times that
we're in this anti-current of counter

9216
02:53:10,309 --> 02:53:10,319
we're in this anti-current of counter
 

9217
02:53:10,319 --> 02:53:12,349
we're in this anti-current of counter
entropy and we could destroy that quite

9218
02:53:12,349 --> 02:53:12,359
entropy and we could destroy that quite
 

9219
02:53:12,359 --> 02:53:14,690
entropy and we could destroy that quite
readily right and and then we're

9220
02:53:14,690 --> 02:53:14,700
readily right and and then we're
 

9221
02:53:14,700 --> 02:53:16,969
readily right and and then we're
nothingness like like everything else

9222
02:53:16,969 --> 02:53:16,979
nothingness like like everything else
 

9223
02:53:16,979 --> 02:53:19,370
nothingness like like everything else
that we know of that's not us that

9224
02:53:19,370 --> 02:53:19,380
that we know of that's not us that
 

9225
02:53:19,380 --> 02:53:21,170
that we know of that's not us that
doesn't have the ability to do something

9226
02:53:21,170 --> 02:53:21,180
doesn't have the ability to do something
 

9227
02:53:21,180 --> 02:53:24,710
doesn't have the ability to do something
that's creative or constructive I mean I

9228
02:53:24,710 --> 02:53:24,720
that's creative or constructive I mean I
 

9229
02:53:24,720 --> 02:53:26,450
that's creative or constructive I mean I
think that that's

9230
02:53:26,450 --> 02:53:26,460
think that that's
 

9231
02:53:26,460 --> 02:53:28,490
think that that's
the answer and I think that our science

9232
02:53:28,490 --> 02:53:28,500
the answer and I think that our science
 

9233
02:53:28,500 --> 02:53:30,769
the answer and I think that our science
really tells us that that's the answer

9234
02:53:30,769 --> 02:53:30,779
really tells us that that's the answer
 

9235
02:53:30,779 --> 02:53:32,990
really tells us that that's the answer
and I think it beckons us with ideas

9236
02:53:32,990 --> 02:53:33,000
and I think it beckons us with ideas
 

9237
02:53:33,000 --> 02:53:35,210
and I think it beckons us with ideas
like we know that things happen outside

9238
02:53:35,210 --> 02:53:35,220
like we know that things happen outside
 

9239
02:53:35,220 --> 02:53:37,429
like we know that things happen outside
of space and time right I mean they're

9240
02:53:37,429 --> 02:53:37,439
of space and time right I mean they're
 

9241
02:53:37,439 --> 02:53:38,870
of space and time right I mean they're
physics experiments right like we know

9242
02:53:38,870 --> 02:53:38,880
physics experiments right like we know
 

9243
02:53:38,880 --> 02:53:41,510
physics experiments right like we know
this from the science of it yet we don't

9244
02:53:41,510 --> 02:53:41,520
this from the science of it yet we don't
 

9245
02:53:41,520 --> 02:53:44,090
this from the science of it yet we don't
stop and look and say wait is that the

9246
02:53:44,090 --> 02:53:44,100
stop and look and say wait is that the
 

9247
02:53:44,100 --> 02:53:45,830
stop and look and say wait is that the
magic of the idea Einstein said God

9248
02:53:45,830 --> 02:53:45,840
magic of the idea Einstein said God
 

9249
02:53:45,840 --> 02:53:47,929
magic of the idea Einstein said God
doesn't play dice with the Universe I

9250
02:53:47,929 --> 02:53:47,939
doesn't play dice with the Universe I
 

9251
02:53:47,939 --> 02:53:50,030
doesn't play dice with the Universe I
think okay maybe

9252
02:53:50,030 --> 02:53:50,040
think okay maybe
 

9253
02:53:50,040 --> 02:53:52,010
think okay maybe
God doesn't play dice with the universe

9254
02:53:52,010 --> 02:53:52,020
God doesn't play dice with the universe
 

9255
02:53:52,020 --> 02:53:54,050
God doesn't play dice with the universe
that Quantum and determinacy and all of

9256
02:53:54,050 --> 02:53:54,060
that Quantum and determinacy and all of
 

9257
02:53:54,060 --> 02:53:55,849
that Quantum and determinacy and all of
that is not just a flip of the coin so

9258
02:53:55,849 --> 02:53:55,859
that is not just a flip of the coin so
 

9259
02:53:55,859 --> 02:53:58,690
that is not just a flip of the coin so
to speak but maybe it's in that

9260
02:53:58,690 --> 02:53:58,700
to speak but maybe it's in that
 

9261
02:53:58,700 --> 02:54:00,889
to speak but maybe it's in that
indeterminacy that we're given the

9262
02:54:00,889 --> 02:54:00,899
indeterminacy that we're given the
 

9263
02:54:00,899 --> 02:54:04,250
indeterminacy that we're given the
opportunity to assert ourselves right to

9264
02:54:04,250 --> 02:54:04,260
opportunity to assert ourselves right to
 

9265
02:54:04,260 --> 02:54:06,530
opportunity to assert ourselves right to
make something one way or another you

9266
02:54:06,530 --> 02:54:06,540
make something one way or another you
 

9267
02:54:06,540 --> 02:54:08,030
make something one way or another you
know maybe it's not God playing dice

9268
02:54:08,030 --> 02:54:08,040
know maybe it's not God playing dice
 

9269
02:54:08,040 --> 02:54:09,950
know maybe it's not God playing dice
with the universe but it's God loading

9270
02:54:09,950 --> 02:54:09,960
with the universe but it's God loading
 

9271
02:54:09,960 --> 02:54:12,469
with the universe but it's God loading
the dice in our favor if we'll only

9272
02:54:12,469 --> 02:54:12,479
the dice in our favor if we'll only
 

9273
02:54:12,479 --> 02:54:15,170
the dice in our favor if we'll only
listen to truth the truth that being

9274
02:54:15,170 --> 02:54:15,180
listen to truth the truth that being
 

9275
02:54:15,180 --> 02:54:17,210
listen to truth the truth that being
destructive doesn't help pursue anything

9276
02:54:17,210 --> 02:54:17,220
destructive doesn't help pursue anything
 

9277
02:54:17,220 --> 02:54:19,010
destructive doesn't help pursue anything
even in the person who thinks it will

9278
02:54:19,010 --> 02:54:19,020
even in the person who thinks it will
 

9279
02:54:19,020 --> 02:54:21,349
even in the person who thinks it will
for themselves and that creativity and

9280
02:54:21,349 --> 02:54:21,359
for themselves and that creativity and
 

9281
02:54:21,359 --> 02:54:23,330
for themselves and that creativity and
generativeness and kindness and

9282
02:54:23,330 --> 02:54:23,340
generativeness and kindness and
 

9283
02:54:23,340 --> 02:54:25,370
generativeness and kindness and
compassion like this is doesn't that

9284
02:54:25,370 --> 02:54:25,380
compassion like this is doesn't that
 

9285
02:54:25,380 --> 02:54:26,929
compassion like this is doesn't that
seem sort of analogous to the Eddie

9286
02:54:26,929 --> 02:54:26,939
seem sort of analogous to the Eddie
 

9287
02:54:26,939 --> 02:54:28,550
seem sort of analogous to the Eddie
current of counter entropy that has us

9288
02:54:28,550 --> 02:54:28,560
current of counter entropy that has us
 

9289
02:54:28,560 --> 02:54:30,590
current of counter entropy that has us
here in the first place and I think

9290
02:54:30,590 --> 02:54:30,600
here in the first place and I think
 

9291
02:54:30,600 --> 02:54:33,050
here in the first place and I think
that's where I I pin meaning and that

9292
02:54:33,050 --> 02:54:33,060
that's where I I pin meaning and that
 

9293
02:54:33,060 --> 02:54:34,849
that's where I I pin meaning and that
meaning then going back to the initial

9294
02:54:34,849 --> 02:54:34,859
meaning then going back to the initial
 

9295
02:54:34,859 --> 02:54:37,490
meaning then going back to the initial
question right is is generated in us

9296
02:54:37,490 --> 02:54:37,500
question right is is generated in us
 

9297
02:54:37,500 --> 02:54:39,769
question right is is generated in us
through emotion through what we feel

9298
02:54:39,769 --> 02:54:39,779
through emotion through what we feel
 

9299
02:54:39,779 --> 02:54:41,269
through emotion through what we feel
that leads us to feel something that is

9300
02:54:41,269 --> 02:54:41,279
that leads us to feel something that is
 

9301
02:54:41,279 --> 02:54:43,130
that leads us to feel something that is
mysterious I don't know why I feel it

9302
02:54:43,130 --> 02:54:43,140
mysterious I don't know why I feel it
 

9303
02:54:43,140 --> 02:54:45,650
mysterious I don't know why I feel it
yeah in some sense the motion is the

9304
02:54:45,650 --> 02:54:45,660
yeah in some sense the motion is the
 

9305
02:54:45,660 --> 02:54:47,269
yeah in some sense the motion is the
kind of the fuel of that creative

9306
02:54:47,269 --> 02:54:47,279
kind of the fuel of that creative
 

9307
02:54:47,279 --> 02:54:49,969
kind of the fuel of that creative
imperative we have but if you step back

9308
02:54:49,969 --> 02:54:49,979
imperative we have but if you step back
 

9309
02:54:49,979 --> 02:54:52,730
imperative we have but if you step back
and look at the tapestry a little bit

9310
02:54:52,730 --> 02:54:52,740
and look at the tapestry a little bit
 

9311
02:54:52,740 --> 02:54:55,070
and look at the tapestry a little bit
it does seem that the destruction the

9312
02:54:55,070 --> 02:54:55,080
it does seem that the destruction the
 

9313
02:54:55,080 --> 02:54:56,750
it does seem that the destruction the
creation of the destruction or the yin

9314
02:54:56,750 --> 02:54:56,760
creation of the destruction or the yin
 

9315
02:54:56,760 --> 02:55:00,170
creation of the destruction or the yin
and yang of of life that it all works

9316
02:55:00,170 --> 02:55:00,180
and yang of of life that it all works
 

9317
02:55:00,180 --> 02:55:01,670
and yang of of life that it all works
only if

9318
02:55:01,670 --> 02:55:01,680
only if
 

9319
02:55:01,680 --> 02:55:03,950
only if
the the the main engine is towards

9320
02:55:03,950 --> 02:55:03,960
the the the main engine is towards
 

9321
02:55:03,960 --> 02:55:07,910
the the the main engine is towards
creativity but uh destruction also

9322
02:55:07,910 --> 02:55:07,920
creativity but uh destruction also
 

9323
02:55:07,920 --> 02:55:10,309
creativity but uh destruction also
makes way for new things

9324
02:55:10,309 --> 02:55:10,319
makes way for new things
 

9325
02:55:10,319 --> 02:55:12,170
makes way for new things
so that's the

9326
02:55:12,170 --> 02:55:12,180
so that's the
 

9327
02:55:12,180 --> 02:55:14,750
so that's the
this kind of struggle it seems like life

9328
02:55:14,750 --> 02:55:14,760
this kind of struggle it seems like life
 

9329
02:55:14,760 --> 02:55:16,429
this kind of struggle it seems like life
is the struggle between the different

9330
02:55:16,429 --> 02:55:16,439
is the struggle between the different
 

9331
02:55:16,439 --> 02:55:18,110
is the struggle between the different
forces that make up the individual human

9332
02:55:18,110 --> 02:55:18,120
forces that make up the individual human
 

9333
02:55:18,120 --> 02:55:20,469
forces that make up the individual human
they make up Society all this tensions

say they're both tearing down they're

9488
02:58:03,170 --> 02:58:03,180
say they're both tearing down they're

tearing down of the forest but one is in
 

9491
02:58:05,939 --> 02:58:07,969
tearing down of the forest but one is in
the service of goodness even though it's

9492
02:58:07,969 --> 02:58:07,979
the service of goodness even though it's
 

9493
02:58:07,979 --> 02:58:09,530
the service of goodness even though it's
hurting the animals and the plants it's

9494
02:58:09,530 --> 02:58:09,540
hurting the animals and the plants it's
 

9495
02:58:09,540 --> 02:58:11,510
hurting the animals and the plants it's
not all good right but but it's in the

9496
02:58:11,510 --> 02:58:11,520
not all good right but but it's in the
 

9497
02:58:11,520 --> 02:58:13,370
not all good right but but it's in the
service of something as opposed to

9499
02:58:13,380 --> 02:58:14,990
service of something as opposed to
something else that's wantonly

9500
02:58:14,990 --> 02:58:15,000
something else that's wantonly
 

9501
02:58:15,000 --> 02:58:16,790
something else that's wantonly
destructive I think there's no good to

9502
02:58:16,790 --> 02:58:16,800
destructive I think there's no good to
 

9503
02:58:16,800 --> 02:58:18,410

9505
02:58:18,420 --> 02:58:21,170
the racial slur there's no good to the
arson right that's destruction in a way

9506
02:58:21,170 --> 02:58:21,180
arson right that's destruction in a way
 

9507
02:58:21,180 --> 02:58:23,150
arson right that's destruction in a way
that's incorporating I think the malice

9508
02:58:23,150 --> 02:58:23,160
that's incorporating I think the malice
 

9509
02:58:23,160 --> 02:58:25,670
that's incorporating I think the malice
of envy you know something that's really

9510
02:58:25,670 --> 02:58:25,680
of envy you know something that's really
 

9511
02:58:25,680 --> 02:58:28,490
of envy you know something that's really
purely if there's a yin and yang that's

9512
02:58:28,490 --> 02:58:28,500
purely if there's a yin and yang that's
 

9513
02:58:28,500 --> 02:58:30,110
purely if there's a yin and yang that's
the destruct that's the destructive

9514
02:58:30,110 --> 02:58:30,120
the destruct that's the destructive
 

9515
02:58:30,120 --> 02:58:32,450
the destruct that's the destructive
that's the Badness end so racial slurs

9516
02:58:32,450 --> 02:58:32,460
that's the Badness end so racial slurs
 

9517
02:58:32,460 --> 02:58:36,530
that's the Badness end so racial slurs
is a surface wave of a deeper thing and

9518
02:58:36,530 --> 02:58:36,540
is a surface wave of a deeper thing and
 

9519
02:58:36,540 --> 02:58:38,990
is a surface wave of a deeper thing and
so I mean this is I mean the reason I

9520
02:58:38,990 --> 02:58:39,000
so I mean this is I mean the reason I
 

9521
02:58:39,000 --> 02:58:40,370
so I mean this is I mean the reason I
bring that up is like all right well

9522
02:58:40,370 --> 02:58:40,380
bring that up is like all right well
 

9523
02:58:40,380 --> 02:58:41,990
bring that up is like all right well
like you have these discussions of

9524
02:58:41,990 --> 02:58:42,000
like you have these discussions of
 

9525
02:58:42,000 --> 02:58:44,690
like you have these discussions of
censorship like what good does allowing

9526
02:58:44,690 --> 02:58:44,700
censorship like what good does allowing
 

9527
02:58:44,700 --> 02:58:48,469
censorship like what good does allowing
racial slurs in Public Communication do

racial slurs in Public Communication do
 

9529
02:58:48,479 --> 02:58:51,170
racial slurs in Public Communication do
right and it's like our communication

9530

right and it's like our communication
 

9531
02:58:51,180 --> 02:58:52,849
right and it's like our communication
would surely be better if we don't say

9532
02:58:52,849 --> 02:58:52,859
would surely be better if we don't say

communication will be better if the
 

9539
02:59:00,720 --> 02:59:03,469
communication will be better if the
amount of bad things is a small fraction

9540
02:59:03,469 --> 02:59:03,479
amount of bad things is a small fraction
 

9541
02:59:03,479 --> 02:59:05,990
amount of bad things is a small fraction
of communication that seems to be more

02:59:28,969 --> 02:59:28,979
piles you created are kind of
 

9563
02:59:28,979 --> 02:59:30,370
piles you created are kind of
overlapping

overlapping
 

9565
02:59:30,380 --> 02:59:34,010
overlapping
it's a gray area yeah I agree with it no

9566
02:59:34,010 --> 02:59:34,020
it's a gray area yeah I agree with it no
 

9567
02:59:34,020 --> 02:59:36,170
it's a gray area yeah I agree with it no
I agree completely that the control of

I think there's a there's a very big
 

9573
02:59:39,359 --> 02:59:43,070
I think there's a there's a very big
problem there so I agree I I think again

9574
02:59:43,070 --> 02:59:43,080
problem there so I agree I I think again
 

9575
02:59:43,080 --> 02:59:45,530
problem there so I agree I I think again
split parsing out the language I I'm not

Prejudice behind it you know I was
 

9589
02:59:57,660 --> 03:00:00,170
Prejudice behind it you know I was
struck I said I do not almost nothing

struck I said I do not almost nothing
 

9591
03:00:00,180 --> 03:00:01,730
struck I said I do not almost nothing
about medicine I get to medical school

9592
03:00:01,730 --> 03:00:01,740
about medicine I get to medical school
 

9593
03:00:01,740 --> 03:00:04,610
about medicine I get to medical school
and start with Anatomy right and it's

9594
03:00:04,610 --> 03:00:04,620
and start with Anatomy right and it's
 

9595
03:00:04,620 --> 03:00:08,090
and start with Anatomy right and it's
remarkable as you know to see where as

remarkable as you know to see where as
 

9597
03:00:08,100 --> 03:00:10,130
remarkable as you know to see where as
the bodies are being dissected that like

9598
03:00:10,130 --> 03:00:10,140
the bodies are being dissected that like
 

9599
03:00:10,140 --> 03:00:13,010
the bodies are being dissected that like
we're we're all humans like is it matter

9600
03:00:13,010 --> 03:00:13,020
we're we're all humans like is it matter
 

9601
03:00:13,020 --> 03:00:15,230
we're we're all humans like is it matter
it doesn't matter any of these things on

9602
03:00:15,230 --> 03:00:15,240
it doesn't matter any of these things on
 

9603
03:00:15,240 --> 03:00:17,450
it doesn't matter any of these things on
the outside like and that's true not

9604
03:00:17,450 --> 03:00:17,460
the outside like and that's true not
 

9605
03:00:17,460 --> 03:00:19,849
the outside like and that's true not
just like in our bodies but but in our

9606
03:00:19,849 --> 03:00:19,859
just like in our bodies but but in our
 

9607
03:00:19,859 --> 03:00:21,710
just like in our bodies but but in our
minds the part of the person that's not

9608
03:00:21,710 --> 03:00:21,720
minds the part of the person that's not
 

9609
03:00:21,720 --> 03:00:23,210
minds the part of the person that's not
there right because now we're trying to

9610
03:00:23,210 --> 03:00:23,220
there right because now we're trying to
 

9611
03:00:23,220 --> 03:00:25,250
there right because now we're trying to
learn from the body and you know it

9612
03:00:25,250 --> 03:00:25,260
learn from the body and you know it
 

9613
03:00:25,260 --> 03:00:26,570
learn from the body and you know it
shows how

9614
03:00:26,570 --> 03:00:26,580
shows how
 

9615
03:00:26,580 --> 03:00:28,370
shows how
ridiculous it is if you think that we're

9616
03:00:28,370 --> 03:00:28,380
ridiculous it is if you think that we're
 

9617
03:00:28,380 --> 03:00:30,710
ridiculous it is if you think that we're
99 Point how many nines you know percent

9618
03:00:30,710 --> 03:00:30,720
99 Point how many nines you know percent
 

9619
03:00:30,720 --> 03:00:32,570
99 Point how many nines you know percent
all alike genetically and by the way

9620
03:00:32,570 --> 03:00:32,580
all alike genetically and by the way
 

9621
03:00:32,580 --> 03:00:34,309
all alike genetically and by the way
it's only like take another tenth off

9622
03:00:34,309 --> 03:00:34,319
it's only like take another tenth off
 

9623
03:00:34,319 --> 03:00:36,830
it's only like take another tenth off
and we're all orangutans right so but

9624
03:00:36,830 --> 03:00:36,840
and we're all orangutans right so but
 

9625
03:00:36,840 --> 03:00:39,349
and we're all orangutans right so but
somehow we we have to see these

9626
03:00:39,349 --> 03:00:39,359
somehow we we have to see these
 

9627
03:00:39,359 --> 03:00:41,929
somehow we we have to see these
differences between us right and where

9628
03:00:41,929 --> 03:00:41,939
differences between us right and where
 

9629
03:00:41,939 --> 03:00:44,269
differences between us right and where
does that come from and I think that I

9630
03:00:44,269 --> 03:00:44,279
does that come from and I think that I
 

9631
03:00:44,279 --> 03:00:46,610
does that come from and I think that I
believe that all comes from Envy in that

9632
03:00:46,610 --> 03:00:46,620
believe that all comes from Envy in that
 

9633
03:00:46,620 --> 03:00:48,290
believe that all comes from Envy in that
classical sense that if I don't feel

9634
03:00:48,290 --> 03:00:48,300
classical sense that if I don't feel
 

9635
03:00:48,300 --> 03:00:50,570
classical sense that if I don't feel
good enough I'm going to want someone to

9636
03:00:50,570 --> 03:00:50,580
good enough I'm going to want someone to
 

9637
03:00:50,580 --> 03:00:53,090
good enough I'm going to want someone to
feel better about and so there can be

9638
03:00:53,090 --> 03:00:53,100
feel better about and so there can be
 

9639
03:00:53,100 --> 03:00:55,910
feel better about and so there can be

the science all that kind of stuff I
 

9735
03:02:41,399 --> 03:02:43,450
the science all that kind of stuff I
think there's so much

9736
03:02:43,450 --> 03:02:43,460
think there's so much
 

9737

intensity
 

9739
03:02:45,080 --> 03:02:48,530

the islavic culture maybe so maybe it's
 

9745
03:02:56,540 --> 03:02:59,090
the islavic culture maybe so maybe it's
across cultures because there's a

9746
03:02:59,090 --> 03:02:59,100
across cultures because there's a
 

9747
03:02:59,100 --> 03:03:00,650
across cultures because there's a
different way that expression occurs we

9748
03:03:00,650 --> 03:03:00,660
different way that expression occurs we
 

9749
03:03:00,660 --> 03:03:02,450
different way that expression occurs we
say like oh it's different and the the

9750

for whatever reason and maybe it's just
 

9759
03:03:10,080 --> 03:03:12,230
for whatever reason and maybe it's just
totally random or maybe it's you know

human happiness and we make these
 

10073
03:09:28,560 --> 03:09:30,530
human happiness and we make these
divisions and we create this aggression

10074
03:09:30,530 --> 03:09:30,540
divisions and we create this aggression
 

10075

destroy the Earth right and then just
 

10081

sat looking at one another you know with

10082
03:09:38,030 --> 03:09:38,040
sat looking at one another you know with
 

10083
03:09:38,040 --> 03:09:40,309
sat looking at one another you know with
it with further growing misunderstanding

10084
03:09:40,309 --> 03:09:40,319
it with further growing misunderstanding
 

10085
03:09:40,319 --> 03:09:42,769
it with further growing misunderstanding
and the opportunity for the proxy fights

10086
03:09:42,769 --> 03:09:42,779
and the opportunity for the proxy fights
 

10087
03:09:42,779 --> 03:09:44,870
and the opportunity for the proxy fights
like rather say the Cuban Missile Crisis

10088
03:09:44,870 --> 03:09:44,880
like rather say the Cuban Missile Crisis
 

10089
03:09:44,880 --> 03:09:46,490
like rather say the Cuban Missile Crisis
which I know wasn't a war but it's an

10090
03:09:46,490 --> 03:09:46,500
which I know wasn't a war but it's an
 

10091
03:09:46,500 --> 03:09:48,290
which I know wasn't a war but it's an
aspect of that right where we just we

10092
03:09:48,290 --> 03:09:48,300
aspect of that right where we just we
 

10093
03:09:48,300 --> 03:09:51,469
aspect of that right where we just we
have ourselves wildly you know at risk

10094
03:09:51,469 --> 03:09:51,479
have ourselves wildly you know at risk
 

10095
03:09:51,479 --> 03:09:52,790
have ourselves wildly you know at risk
of Destruction

10096
03:09:52,790 --> 03:09:52,800
of Destruction
 

10097
03:09:52,800 --> 03:09:54,950

without any Mutual understanding and

10098
03:09:54,950 --> 03:09:54,960
without any Mutual understanding and
 

10099
03:09:54,960 --> 03:09:57,290
without any Mutual understanding and
again I would argue that that is the

10100
03:09:57,290 --> 03:09:57,300
again I would argue that that is the
 

10101
03:09:57,300 --> 03:09:59,510
again I would argue that that is the
opposite of the counter entropy right

10102
03:09:59,510 --> 03:09:59,520
opposite of the counter entropy right
 

10103
03:09:59,520 --> 03:10:01,250
opposite of the counter entropy right
like we are setting everything up for

10104
03:10:01,250 --> 03:10:01,260

and more towards reinstating the state
 

10117

globally so to speak right but the other
 

10183
03:11:23,939 --> 03:11:26,090

paralyze this with error right and and
 

10199
03:11:42,120 --> 03:11:44,330
paralyze this with error right and and
for someone who's who's young and trying

10200
03:11:44,330 --> 03:11:44,340
for someone who's who's young and trying
 

10201
03:11:44,340 --> 03:11:45,590
for someone who's who's young and trying
to make their ways like how do you

10202
03:11:45,590 --> 03:11:45,600
to make their ways like how do you
 

10203
03:11:45,600 --> 03:11:47,150
to make their ways like how do you
figure your way out in this world that

10204
03:11:47,150 --> 03:11:47,160
figure your way out in this world that
 

10205
03:11:47,160 --> 03:11:48,469
figure your way out in this world that
your word isn't even going to exist

the the generations before you are right
 

10211
03:11:54,300 --> 03:11:57,650
the the generations before you are right
in so many ways and there can become I
