to collaborate in new ways sharing code

56
00:01:05,410 --> 00:01:05,420
to collaborate in new ways sharing code
 

57
00:01:05,420 --> 00:01:09,289
to collaborate in new ways sharing code
doing that under free license which is

58
00:01:09,289 --> 00:01:09,299
doing that under free license which is
 

59
00:01:09,299 --> 00:01:10,990
doing that under free license which is
really interesting because it empowers

60
00:01:10,990 --> 00:01:11,000
really interesting because it empowers
 

61
00:01:11,000 --> 00:01:13,609
really interesting because it empowers
an ability to work together that's

62
00:01:13,609 --> 00:01:13,619
an ability to work together that's
 

63
00:01:13,619 --> 00:01:15,350
an ability to work together that's
really hard to do if the code is still

64
00:01:15,350 --> 00:01:15,360
really hard to do if the code is still
 

65
00:01:15,360 --> 00:01:17,570
really hard to do if the code is still
proprietary because then if I chip in

that is but the idea that everyone can

uh creative software production and I
 

79
00:01:32,820 --> 00:01:34,249
uh creative software production and I
realized that that kind of collaboration

80
00:01:34,249 --> 00:01:34,259
realized that that kind of collaboration
 

81
00:01:34,259 --> 00:01:36,410
realized that that kind of collaboration
could extend beyond just software to all

82
00:01:36,410 --> 00:01:36,420
could extend beyond just software to all
 

83
00:01:36,420 --> 00:01:39,050
could extend beyond just software to all

thing that I thought of was an
 

87
00:01:40,259 --> 00:01:42,350
thing that I thought of was an
encyclopedia and I thought oh that seems

88
00:01:42,350 --> 00:01:42,360
encyclopedia and I thought oh that seems
 

89
00:01:42,360 --> 00:01:44,569

obvious that an encyclopedia you can

90
00:01:44,569 --> 00:01:44,579
obvious that an encyclopedia you can
 

91
00:01:44,579 --> 00:01:46,490
obvious that an encyclopedia you can
collaborate on it there's a few reasons

92
00:01:46,490 --> 00:01:46,500
collaborate on it there's a few reasons
 

93
00:01:46,500 --> 00:01:50,330
collaborate on it there's a few reasons
why one we all pretty much know what an

94
00:01:50,330 --> 00:01:50,340
why one we all pretty much know what an
 

95
00:01:50,340 --> 00:01:52,550
why one we all pretty much know what an
encyclopedia entry on say the Eiffel

encyclopedia entry on say the Eiffel
 

97
00:01:52,560 --> 00:01:54,770

something about the architect etc etc so

104
00:02:02,810 --> 00:02:02,820
something about the architect etc etc so
 

105
00:02:02,820 --> 00:02:04,310
something about the architect etc etc so
we have a shared understanding of what

106
00:02:04,310 --> 00:02:04,320
we have a shared understanding of what
 

107
00:02:04,320 --> 00:02:05,870
we have a shared understanding of what
it is we're trying to do and then we can

108
00:02:05,870 --> 00:02:05,880
it is we're trying to do and then we can
 

109
00:02:05,880 --> 00:02:07,190
it is we're trying to do and then we can
collaborate and different people can

110
00:02:07,190 --> 00:02:07,200
collaborate and different people can
 

111
00:02:07,200 --> 00:02:09,350

chip in and find sources and so on and

112
00:02:09,350 --> 00:02:09,360
chip in and find sources and so on and
 

113
00:02:09,360 --> 00:02:13,729
chip in and find sources and so on and
so forth so set up first new pedia which

114
00:02:13,729 --> 00:02:13,739
so forth so set up first new pedia which
 

115
00:02:13,739 --> 00:02:17,809
so forth so set up first new pedia which
was about two years before Wikipedia and

116
00:02:17,809 --> 00:02:17,819
was about two years before Wikipedia and
 

117
00:02:17,819 --> 00:02:22,729
was about two years before Wikipedia and
with newpedia we we had this idea that

118
00:02:22,729 --> 00:02:22,739
with newpedia we we had this idea that
 

119
00:02:22,739 --> 00:02:25,190
with newpedia we we had this idea that
in order to be respected we had to be

120
00:02:25,190 --> 00:02:25,200
in order to be respected we had to be
 

121
00:02:25,200 --> 00:02:27,309
in order to be respected we had to be
even more academic than a traditional

122
00:02:27,309 --> 00:02:27,319
even more academic than a traditional
 

123
00:02:27,319 --> 00:02:30,290
even more academic than a traditional
encyclopedia because a bunch of

um and two two things came with that so

um and two two things came with that so
 

139
00:02:44,700 --> 00:02:47,570
um and two two things came with that so
one thing one of the earliest entries

140
00:02:47,570 --> 00:02:47,580
one thing one of the earliest entries
 

141
00:02:47,580 --> 00:02:49,790
one thing one of the earliest entries
that we published after this rigorous

00:02:49,790 --> 00:02:49,800
that we published after this rigorous
 

143
00:02:49,800 --> 00:02:50,990
that we published after this rigorous

process
 

145
00:02:51,000 --> 00:02:52,790
process
a few days later we had to pull it

146
00:02:52,790 --> 00:02:52,800
a few days later we had to pull it
 

147
00:02:52,800 --> 00:02:54,589
a few days later we had to pull it
because as soon as it hit the web and

148
00:02:54,589 --> 00:02:54,599
because as soon as it hit the web and
 

149
00:02:54,599 --> 00:02:56,470
because as soon as it hit the web and
the broader Community took a look at it

150
00:02:56,470 --> 00:02:56,480
the broader Community took a look at it
 

151
00:02:56,480 --> 00:02:59,509
the broader Community took a look at it
people noticed plagiarism and realized

152
00:02:59,509 --> 00:02:59,519
people noticed plagiarism and realized
 

153
00:02:59,519 --> 00:03:01,190
people noticed plagiarism and realized
that it wasn't actually that good even

154
00:03:01,190 --> 00:03:01,200
that it wasn't actually that good even
 

155
00:03:01,200 --> 00:03:02,690
that it wasn't actually that good even
though it had been reviewed by academics

156
00:03:02,690 --> 00:03:02,700
though it had been reviewed by academics
 

157
00:03:02,700 --> 00:03:04,790
though it had been reviewed by academics
and so on so we had to pull it so it's

158
00:03:04,790 --> 00:03:04,800
and so on so we had to pull it so it's
 

159
00:03:04,800 --> 00:03:06,530
and so on so we had to pull it so it's
like okay well so much for a seven stage

160
00:03:06,530 --> 00:03:06,540
like okay well so much for a seven stage
 

161
00:03:06,540 --> 00:03:10,070
like okay well so much for a seven stage
review process but also I decided that I

162
00:03:10,070 --> 00:03:10,080
review process but also I decided that I
 

163
00:03:10,080 --> 00:03:11,869
review process but also I decided that I
wanted to try I was frustrated and why

164
00:03:11,869 --> 00:03:11,879
wanted to try I was frustrated and why
 

165

other people jumped in everybody was

328
00:05:57,710 --> 00:05:57,720
other people jumped in everybody was
 

329
00:05:57,720 --> 00:05:59,090
other people jumped in everybody was
interested in the topic because it's all

330
00:05:59,090 --> 00:05:59,100
interested in the topic because it's all
 

331
00:05:59,100 --> 00:06:01,129
interested in the topic because it's all
in the news at the moment and so it's

332
00:06:01,129 --> 00:06:01,139
in the news at the moment and so it's
 

333
00:06:01,139 --> 00:06:02,510
in the news at the moment and so it's
just a completely different model which

334
00:06:02,510 --> 00:06:02,520
just a completely different model which
 

335
00:06:02,520 --> 00:06:04,370
just a completely different model which
worked much much better well what is it

336
00:06:04,370 --> 00:06:04,380
worked much much better well what is it
 

337
00:06:04,380 --> 00:06:06,409
worked much much better well what is it
that made that so accessible so fun so

338
00:06:06,409 --> 00:06:06,419
that made that so accessible so fun so
 

339
00:06:06,419 --> 00:06:09,590
that made that so accessible so fun so
uh so natural to just add something well

340
00:06:09,590 --> 00:06:09,600
uh so natural to just add something well
 

341
00:06:09,600 --> 00:06:11,749
uh so natural to just add something well
I think it's you know especially in the

342
00:06:11,749 --> 00:06:11,759
I think it's you know especially in the
 

343
00:06:11,759 --> 00:06:13,010
I think it's you know especially in the
early days and this by the way has

344
00:06:13,010 --> 00:06:13,020
early days and this by the way has
 

345
00:06:13,020 --> 00:06:14,510
early days and this by the way has
gotten much harder because there are

346
00:06:14,510 --> 00:06:14,520
gotten much harder because there are
 

347
00:06:14,520 --> 00:06:16,969
gotten much harder because there are
fewer topics that are just Green Field

348
00:06:16,969 --> 00:06:16,979
fewer topics that are just Green Field
 

349
00:06:16,979 --> 00:06:19,189
fewer topics that are just Green Field
you know available

350
00:06:19,189 --> 00:06:19,199
you know available
 

351
00:06:19,199 --> 00:06:21,650
you know available
um but you know you could say oh well uh

352
00:06:21,650 --> 00:06:21,660
um but you know you could say oh well uh
 

353
00:06:21,660 --> 00:06:23,629
um but you know you could say oh well uh
you know I I know a little bit about

354
00:06:23,629 --> 00:06:23,639
you know I I know a little bit about
 

355
00:06:23,639 --> 00:06:26,629
you know I I know a little bit about
this and I can I can get it started uh

356
00:06:26,629 --> 00:06:26,639
this and I can I can get it started uh
 

357
00:06:26,639 --> 00:06:28,550
this and I can I can get it started uh
but then it is fun to to come back then

358
00:06:28,550 --> 00:06:28,560
but then it is fun to to come back then
 

359
00:06:28,560 --> 00:06:30,290
but then it is fun to to come back then
and see other people have added and

360
00:06:30,290 --> 00:06:30,300
and see other people have added and
 

361
00:06:30,300 --> 00:06:32,330
and see other people have added and
improved and so on and so forth and that

362
00:06:32,330 --> 00:06:32,340
improved and so on and so forth and that
 

363
00:06:32,340 --> 00:06:34,610
improved and so on and so forth and that
idea of collaborating you know where

364
00:06:34,610 --> 00:06:34,620
idea of collaborating you know where
 

365
00:06:34,620 --> 00:06:36,230
idea of collaborating you know where
people can much like open source

366
00:06:36,230 --> 00:06:36,240
people can much like open source
 

367
00:06:36,240 --> 00:06:37,790
people can much like open source
software

368
00:06:37,790 --> 00:06:37,800
software
 

369
00:06:37,800 --> 00:06:39,290
software
um you know you you put your code out

370
00:06:39,290 --> 00:06:39,300
um you know you you put your code out
 

371
00:06:39,300 --> 00:06:41,029
um you know you you put your code out
and then people suggest revisions and I

372
00:06:41,029 --> 00:06:41,039
and then people suggest revisions and I
 

373
00:06:41,039 --> 00:06:43,010
and then people suggest revisions and I
change it and it modifies and it grows

374
00:06:43,010 --> 00:06:43,020
change it and it modifies and it grows
 

375
00:06:43,020 --> 00:06:45,890
change it and it modifies and it grows

381
00:06:50,460 --> 00:06:52,249
quite geeky hobby but
um people enjoy it how much debate was

382
00:06:52,249 --> 00:06:52,259
um people enjoy it how much debate was
 

383
00:06:52,259 --> 00:06:54,170
um people enjoy it how much debate was
there over the interface over the

384
00:06:54,170 --> 00:06:54,180
there over the interface over the
 

385
00:06:54,180 --> 00:06:55,909
there over the interface over the
details of how to make that well

386
00:06:55,909 --> 00:06:55,919
details of how to make that well
 

387
00:06:55,919 --> 00:06:57,830
details of how to make that well
seamless and frictionless yeah I mean

388
00:06:57,830 --> 00:06:57,840
seamless and frictionless yeah I mean
 

389
00:06:57,840 --> 00:06:59,570
seamless and frictionless yeah I mean
not as much as there probably should

390
00:06:59,570 --> 00:06:59,580
not as much as there probably should
 

391
00:06:59,580 --> 00:07:02,150
not as much as there probably should
have been in a way during that two years

392
00:07:02,150 --> 00:07:02,160
have been in a way during that two years
 

393
00:07:02,160 --> 00:07:05,090
have been in a way during that two years
of the failure of newpedia where very

394
00:07:05,090 --> 00:07:05,100
of the failure of newpedia where very
 

395
00:07:05,100 --> 00:07:06,710
of the failure of newpedia where very
little work got done

396
00:07:06,710 --> 00:07:06,720
little work got done
 

397
00:07:06,720 --> 00:07:08,990
little work got done
what was actually productive was there

398
00:07:08,990 --> 00:07:09,000
what was actually productive was there
 

399
00:07:09,000 --> 00:07:11,090
what was actually productive was there
was a huge long discussion email

400
00:07:11,090 --> 00:07:11,100
was a huge long discussion email
 

401
00:07:11,100 --> 00:07:13,430
was a huge long discussion email
discussion very clever people talking

402
00:07:13,430 --> 00:07:13,440
discussion very clever people talking
 

403
00:07:13,440 --> 00:07:15,529
discussion very clever people talking
about things like neutrality talking

404
00:07:15,529 --> 00:07:15,539
about things like neutrality talking
 

405
00:07:15,539 --> 00:07:17,749
about things like neutrality talking
about what is an encyclopedia but also

406
00:07:17,749 --> 00:07:17,759
about what is an encyclopedia but also
 

407
00:07:17,759 --> 00:07:19,490
about what is an encyclopedia but also
talking about more technical ideas you

408
00:07:19,490 --> 00:07:19,500
talking about more technical ideas you
 

409
00:07:19,500 --> 00:07:21,830
talking about more technical ideas you
know things back then XML was kind of

410
00:07:21,830 --> 00:07:21,840
know things back then XML was kind of
 

411
00:07:21,840 --> 00:07:23,930
know things back then XML was kind of
all the rage and thinking about ah could

412
00:07:23,930 --> 00:07:23,940
all the rage and thinking about ah could
 

413
00:07:23,940 --> 00:07:26,950
all the rage and thinking about ah could
we you know shouldn't you have certain

414
00:07:26,950 --> 00:07:26,960
we you know shouldn't you have certain
 

415
00:07:26,960 --> 00:07:29,749
we you know shouldn't you have certain
uh data that might be in multiple

416
00:07:29,749 --> 00:07:29,759
uh data that might be in multiple
 

417
00:07:29,759 --> 00:07:31,430
uh data that might be in multiple
articles that gets updated automatically

418
00:07:31,430 --> 00:07:31,440
articles that gets updated automatically
 

419
00:07:31,440 --> 00:07:33,469
articles that gets updated automatically
so for example you know the population

420
00:07:33,469 --> 00:07:33,479
so for example you know the population
 

421
00:07:33,479 --> 00:07:36,230
so for example you know the population
of New York City every 10 years there's

422
00:07:36,230 --> 00:07:36,240
of New York City every 10 years there's
 

423
00:07:36,240 --> 00:07:38,450
of New York City every 10 years there's
a new official census couldn't you just

424
00:07:38,450 --> 00:07:38,460
a new official census couldn't you just
 

425
00:07:38,460 --> 00:07:41,029
a new official census couldn't you just
up at the update that bit of data in one

426
00:07:41,029 --> 00:07:41,039
up at the update that bit of data in one
 

427
00:07:41,039 --> 00:07:42,350
up at the update that bit of data in one
place and it would update across all

428
00:07:42,350 --> 00:07:42,360
place and it would update across all
 

429
00:07:42,360 --> 00:07:44,450
place and it would update across all
those that is a reality today but back

430
00:07:44,450 --> 00:07:44,460
those that is a reality today but back
 

431
00:07:44,460 --> 00:07:46,070
those that is a reality today but back
then it was just like how do we do that

432
00:07:46,070 --> 00:07:46,080
then it was just like how do we do that
 

433
00:07:46,080 --> 00:07:47,870
then it was just like how do we do that
how do we think about that so that is a

434
00:07:47,870 --> 00:07:47,880
how do we think about that so that is a
 

435
00:07:47,880 --> 00:07:49,790
how do we think about that so that is a
reality today where it's yeah there's

436
00:07:49,790 --> 00:07:49,800
reality today where it's yeah there's
 

437
00:07:49,800 --> 00:07:52,430
reality today where it's yeah there's
some yeah so we can data variables yeah

438
00:07:52,430 --> 00:07:52,440
some yeah so we can data variables yeah
 

439
00:07:52,440 --> 00:07:56,150
some yeah so we can data variables yeah
Wiki data um you can you can link uh you

440
00:07:56,150 --> 00:07:56,160
Wiki data um you can you can link uh you
 

441
00:07:56,160 --> 00:07:57,589
Wiki data um you can you can link uh you
know from a Wikipedia entry you can link

442
00:07:57,589 --> 00:07:57,599
know from a Wikipedia entry you can link
 

443
00:07:57,599 --> 00:08:00,350
know from a Wikipedia entry you can link
to that piece of data in wikidata I mean

444
00:08:00,350 --> 00:08:00,360
to that piece of data in wikidata I mean
 

445
00:08:00,360 --> 00:08:01,610
to that piece of data in wikidata I mean
it's a pretty Advanced thing but there

446
00:08:01,610 --> 00:08:01,620
it's a pretty Advanced thing but there
 

447
00:08:01,620 --> 00:08:02,870
it's a pretty Advanced thing but there
are Advanced users who are doing that

448
00:08:02,870 --> 00:08:02,880
are Advanced users who are doing that
 

449
00:08:02,880 --> 00:08:04,850
are Advanced users who are doing that
and then when when that gets updated it

450
00:08:04,850 --> 00:08:04,860
and then when when that gets updated it
 

451
00:08:04,860 --> 00:08:06,170
and then when when that gets updated it
updates in all the languages where

452
00:08:06,170 --> 00:08:06,180
updates in all the languages where
 

453
00:08:06,180 --> 00:08:07,550
updates in all the languages where
you've done that I mean that's really

454
00:08:07,550 --> 00:08:07,560
you've done that I mean that's really
 

455
00:08:07,560 --> 00:08:09,110
you've done that I mean that's really
interesting there was this chain of

456
00:08:09,110 --> 00:08:09,120
interesting there was this chain of
 

457
00:08:09,120 --> 00:08:10,730
interesting there was this chain of
emails in the early days of discussing

458
00:08:10,730 --> 00:08:10,740
emails in the early days of discussing
 

459
00:08:10,740 --> 00:08:14,029
emails in the early days of discussing
the details of what is so there's the

460
00:08:14,029 --> 00:08:14,039
the details of what is so there's the
 

461
00:08:14,039 --> 00:08:15,469
the details of what is so there's the
interface there's the yeah so the

462
00:08:15,469 --> 00:08:15,479
interface there's the yeah so the
 

463
00:08:15,479 --> 00:08:17,629
interface there's the yeah so the
interface so an example there was some

464
00:08:17,629 --> 00:08:17,639
interface so an example there was some
 

465
00:08:17,639 --> 00:08:20,210
interface so an example there was some
software called use mod wiki which we

466
00:08:20,210 --> 00:08:20,220
software called use mod wiki which we
 

467
00:08:20,220 --> 00:08:22,490
software called use mod wiki which we
started with it's quite amusing actually

468
00:08:22,490 --> 00:08:22,500
started with it's quite amusing actually
 

469
00:08:22,500 --> 00:08:24,770
started with it's quite amusing actually
because the main reason we launched with

470
00:08:24,770 --> 00:08:24,780
because the main reason we launched with
 

471
00:08:24,780 --> 00:08:27,110
because the main reason we launched with
use mod wiki is that it was a single

472
00:08:27,110 --> 00:08:27,120
use mod wiki is that it was a single
 

473
00:08:27,120 --> 00:08:29,330
use mod wiki is that it was a single
Perl script so it was really easy for me

474
00:08:29,330 --> 00:08:29,340
Perl script so it was really easy for me
 

475
00:08:29,340 --> 00:08:30,890
Perl script so it was really easy for me
to install it on the server and just get

476
00:08:30,890 --> 00:08:30,900
to install it on the server and just get
 

477
00:08:30,900 --> 00:08:33,709
to install it on the server and just get
running but it was

478
00:08:33,709 --> 00:08:33,719
running but it was
 

479
00:08:33,719 --> 00:08:35,630
running but it was
um you know some guy's hobby project it

480
00:08:35,630 --> 00:08:35,640
um you know some guy's hobby project it
 

481
00:08:35,640 --> 00:08:37,610
um you know some guy's hobby project it
was cool but it was just a hobby project

482
00:08:37,610 --> 00:08:37,620
was cool but it was just a hobby project
 

483
00:08:37,620 --> 00:08:42,170
was cool but it was just a hobby project
and uh all the data was stored uh in

484
00:08:42,170 --> 00:08:42,180
and uh all the data was stored uh in
 

485
00:08:42,180 --> 00:08:44,449
and uh all the data was stored uh in
flat text files so there was no real

486
00:08:44,449 --> 00:08:44,459
flat text files so there was no real
 

487
00:08:44,459 --> 00:08:47,389
flat text files so there was no real
database behind it so the to search the

488
00:08:47,389 --> 00:08:47,399
database behind it so the to search the
 

489
00:08:47,399 --> 00:08:49,850
database behind it so the to search the
site you basically used graph which is

490
00:08:49,850 --> 00:08:49,860
site you basically used graph which is
 

491
00:08:49,860 --> 00:08:52,490
site you basically used graph which is
just like the basic Unix utility to like

492
00:08:52,490 --> 00:08:52,500
just like the basic Unix utility to like
 

493
00:08:52,500 --> 00:08:54,769
just like the basic Unix utility to like
look through all the files so that

494
00:08:54,769 --> 00:08:54,779
look through all the files so that
 

495
00:08:54,779 --> 00:08:55,970
look through all the files so that
clearly was never going to scale but

496
00:08:55,970 --> 00:08:55,980
clearly was never going to scale but
 

497
00:08:55,980 --> 00:08:58,389
clearly was never going to scale but
also in the early days it didn't have

498
00:08:58,389 --> 00:08:58,399
also in the early days it didn't have
 

499
00:08:58,399 --> 00:09:01,190
also in the early days it didn't have
real logins so you could set your

500
00:09:01,190 --> 00:09:01,200
real logins so you could set your
 

501
00:09:01,200 --> 00:09:03,889
real logins so you could set your
username but there were no passwords so

502
00:09:03,889 --> 00:09:03,899
username but there were no passwords so
 

503
00:09:03,899 --> 00:09:07,190
username but there were no passwords so
you know I might say Bob Smith and then

504
00:09:07,190 --> 00:09:07,200
you know I might say Bob Smith and then
 

505
00:09:07,200 --> 00:09:08,509
you know I might say Bob Smith and then
someone else comes along and says no I'm

506
00:09:08,509 --> 00:09:08,519
someone else comes along and says no I'm
 

507
00:09:08,519 --> 00:09:10,190
someone else comes along and says no I'm
Bob Smith and they both had it now that

508
00:09:10,190 --> 00:09:10,200
Bob Smith and they both had it now that
 

509
00:09:10,200 --> 00:09:11,269
Bob Smith and they both had it now that
never really happened we didn't have a

510
00:09:11,269 --> 00:09:11,279
never really happened we didn't have a
 

511
00:09:11,279 --> 00:09:12,290
never really happened we didn't have a
problem with it but it was kind of

512
00:09:12,290 --> 00:09:12,300
problem with it but it was kind of
 

513
00:09:12,300 --> 00:09:13,850
problem with it but it was kind of
obvious like you can't go a big website

514
00:09:13,850 --> 00:09:13,860
obvious like you can't go a big website
 

515
00:09:13,860 --> 00:09:15,050
obvious like you can't go a big website
where everybody can pretend to be

516
00:09:15,050 --> 00:09:15,060
where everybody can pretend to be
 

517
00:09:15,060 --> 00:09:16,670
where everybody can pretend to be
everybody that's that's not going to be

518
00:09:16,670 --> 00:09:16,680
everybody that's that's not going to be
 

519
00:09:16,680 --> 00:09:18,889
everybody that's that's not going to be
good for trust and reputation and so

520
00:09:18,889 --> 00:09:18,899
good for trust and reputation and so
 

521
00:09:18,899 --> 00:09:21,470
good for trust and reputation and so
forth so quickly I had to write a little

522
00:09:21,470 --> 00:09:21,480
forth so quickly I had to write a little
 

523
00:09:21,480 --> 00:09:23,509
forth so quickly I had to write a little
you know login you know store people's

524
00:09:23,509 --> 00:09:23,519
you know login you know store people's
 

525
00:09:23,519 --> 00:09:24,710
you know login you know store people's
passwords and things like that so you

526
00:09:24,710 --> 00:09:24,720
passwords and things like that so you
 

527
00:09:24,720 --> 00:09:26,750
passwords and things like that so you
can have unique identities and then

528
00:09:26,750 --> 00:09:26,760
can have unique identities and then
 

529
00:09:26,760 --> 00:09:28,490
can have unique identities and then
another example of something you know

530
00:09:28,490 --> 00:09:28,500
another example of something you know
 

531
00:09:28,500 --> 00:09:30,170
another example of something you know
quite he would have never thought would

532
00:09:30,170 --> 00:09:30,180
quite he would have never thought would
 

533
00:09:30,180 --> 00:09:31,670
quite he would have never thought would
have been a good idea and it turned out

534
00:09:31,670 --> 00:09:31,680
have been a good idea and it turned out
 

535
00:09:31,680 --> 00:09:33,530
have been a good idea and it turned out
to not be a problem but

536
00:09:33,530 --> 00:09:33,540
to not be a problem but
 

537
00:09:33,540 --> 00:09:35,509
to not be a problem but
to make a link in Wikipedia in the early

538
00:09:35,509 --> 00:09:35,519
to make a link in Wikipedia in the early
 

539
00:09:35,519 --> 00:09:36,350
to make a link in Wikipedia in the early
days

540
00:09:36,350 --> 00:09:36,360
days
 

541
00:09:36,360 --> 00:09:39,230
days
you would make a link to a page that may

542
00:09:39,230 --> 00:09:39,240
you would make a link to a page that may
 

543
00:09:39,240 --> 00:09:41,570
you would make a link to a page that may
or may not exist by just using camel

544
00:09:41,570 --> 00:09:41,580
or may not exist by just using camel
 

545
00:09:41,580 --> 00:09:43,430
or may not exist by just using camel
case meaning it's like uppercase

546
00:09:43,430 --> 00:09:43,440
case meaning it's like uppercase
 

547
00:09:43,440 --> 00:09:44,810
case meaning it's like uppercase
lowercase and you smash the words

548
00:09:44,810 --> 00:09:44,820
lowercase and you smash the words
 

549
00:09:44,820 --> 00:09:48,530
lowercase and you smash the words
together so maybe uh New York City he

550
00:09:48,530 --> 00:09:48,540
together so maybe uh New York City he
 

551
00:09:48,540 --> 00:09:52,310
together so maybe uh New York City he
might type new no space capital Y York

552
00:09:52,310 --> 00:09:52,320
might type new no space capital Y York
 

553
00:09:52,320 --> 00:09:53,389
might type new no space capital Y York
City

554
00:09:53,389 --> 00:09:53,399
City
 

555
00:09:53,399 --> 00:09:54,829
City
and that would make a link but that was

556
00:09:54,829 --> 00:09:54,839
and that would make a link but that was
 

557
00:09:54,839 --> 00:09:57,290
and that would make a link but that was
ugly that was clearly not right and so I

558
00:09:57,290 --> 00:09:57,300
ugly that was clearly not right and so I
 

559
00:09:57,300 --> 00:09:59,030
ugly that was clearly not right and so I
was like okay well that that's just not

560
00:09:59,030 --> 00:09:59,040
was like okay well that that's just not
 

561
00:09:59,040 --> 00:10:01,250
was like okay well that that's just not
going to look nice let's just use square

562
00:10:01,250 --> 00:10:01,260
going to look nice let's just use square
 

563
00:10:01,260 --> 00:10:03,889
going to look nice let's just use square
brackets two square brackets makes a

564
00:10:03,889 --> 00:10:03,899
brackets two square brackets makes a
 

565
00:10:03,899 --> 00:10:05,389
brackets two square brackets makes a
link that may have been an option in the

566
00:10:05,389 --> 00:10:05,399
link that may have been an option in the
 

567
00:10:05,399 --> 00:10:06,410
link that may have been an option in the
software I'm not sure I thought up

568
00:10:06,410 --> 00:10:06,420
software I'm not sure I thought up
 

569
00:10:06,420 --> 00:10:08,150
software I'm not sure I thought up
Square broadcast but anyway we just did

570
00:10:08,150 --> 00:10:08,160
Square broadcast but anyway we just did
 

571
00:10:08,160 --> 00:10:09,410
Square broadcast but anyway we just did
that

572
00:10:09,410 --> 00:10:09,420
that
 

573
00:10:09,420 --> 00:10:10,610
that
um which worked really well it makes

574
00:10:10,610 --> 00:10:10,620
um which worked really well it makes
 

575
00:10:10,620 --> 00:10:12,290
um which worked really well it makes
nice links and you know you can see in

576
00:10:12,290 --> 00:10:12,300
nice links and you know you can see in
 

577
00:10:12,300 --> 00:10:14,150
nice links and you know you can see in
its red links or Blue Links depending on

578
00:10:14,150 --> 00:10:14,160
its red links or Blue Links depending on
 

579

its red links or Blue Links depending on
if the page exists or not but the thing

580
00:10:16,250 --> 00:10:16,260
if the page exists or not but the thing
 

581
00:10:16,260 --> 00:10:18,350

that didn't occur to me even think about

582
00:10:18,350 --> 00:10:18,360
that didn't occur to me even think about
 

583
00:10:18,360 --> 00:10:20,690
that didn't occur to me even think about
is that for example on the German

584
00:10:20,690 --> 00:10:20,700
is that for example on the German
 

585
00:10:20,700 --> 00:10:22,850
is that for example on the German
language standard keyboard there is no

586
00:10:22,850 --> 00:10:22,860
language standard keyboard there is no
 

587
00:10:22,860 --> 00:10:24,110
language standard keyboard there is no
square bracket

588

square bracket
 

589
00:10:24,120 --> 00:10:26,329

so for German Wikipedia to succeed

590
00:10:26,329 --> 00:10:26,339
so for German Wikipedia to succeed
 

591
00:10:26,339 --> 00:10:28,310
so for German Wikipedia to succeed
people had to learn to do some alt codes

592
00:10:28,310 --> 00:10:28,320
people had to learn to do some alt codes
 

593
00:10:28,320 --> 00:10:30,170
people had to learn to do some alt codes
to get the square bracket or they a lot

594
00:10:30,170 --> 00:10:30,180
to get the square bracket or they a lot
 

595
00:10:30,180 --> 00:10:32,570
to get the square bracket or they a lot
of users cut and paste a square bracket

596
00:10:32,570 --> 00:10:32,580
of users cut and paste a square bracket
 

597
00:10:32,580 --> 00:10:34,190
of users cut and paste a square bracket
when they could find one and they just

598
00:10:34,190 --> 00:10:34,200
when they could find one and they just
 

599
00:10:34,200 --> 00:10:36,170
when they could find one and they just
cut and paste one in and yep German

um how is the the German keyboards don't

606
00:10:42,710 --> 00:10:42,720
um how is the the German keyboards don't
 

607
00:10:42,720 --> 00:10:44,210
um how is the the German keyboards don't
have a square bracket how do you do

00:10:48,949 --> 00:10:48,959
it's life to its fullest with us we have
 

613
00:10:48,959 --> 00:10:50,870
it's life to its fullest with us we have
a very good question I'm not really sure

614
00:10:50,870 --> 00:10:50,880
a very good question I'm not really sure
 

615
00:10:50,880 --> 00:10:52,670
a very good question I'm not really sure
I mean maybe it does now because of

616
00:10:52,670 --> 00:10:52,680
I mean maybe it does now because of
 

617
00:10:52,680 --> 00:10:55,069
I mean maybe it does now because of
keyboard standards have you know drifted

618
00:10:55,069 --> 00:10:55,079
keyboard standards have you know drifted
 

619
00:10:55,079 --> 00:10:57,290
keyboard standards have you know drifted
over time and becomes useful to have a

620
00:10:57,290 --> 00:10:57,300
over time and becomes useful to have a
 

621
00:10:57,300 --> 00:10:58,670
over time and becomes useful to have a
certain character I mean it's same thing

622
00:10:58,670 --> 00:10:58,680
certain character I mean it's same thing
 

623
00:10:58,680 --> 00:11:00,949
certain character I mean it's same thing
like there's not really a w character in

624
00:11:00,949 --> 00:11:00,959
like there's not really a w character in
 

625
00:11:00,959 --> 00:11:02,509
like there's not really a w character in
Italian

626
00:11:02,509 --> 00:11:02,519
Italian
 

627
00:11:02,519 --> 00:11:04,370
Italian
um and it wasn't on keyboards or I think

628
00:11:04,370 --> 00:11:04,380
um and it wasn't on keyboards or I think
 

629
00:11:04,380 --> 00:11:06,949
um and it wasn't on keyboards or I think
it is now but in in general W is not a

630
00:11:06,949 --> 00:11:06,959
it is now but in in general W is not a
 

631
00:11:06,959 --> 00:11:09,050
it is now but in in general W is not a
letter in Italian language but it

632
00:11:09,050 --> 00:11:09,060
letter in Italian language but it
 

633
00:11:09,060 --> 00:11:10,610
letter in Italian language but it
appears in enough International words

634
00:11:10,610 --> 00:11:10,620
appears in enough International words
 

635
00:11:10,620 --> 00:11:13,130
appears in enough International words
that it's crept into Italians and all of

636
00:11:13,130 --> 00:11:13,140
that it's crept into Italians and all of
 

637
00:11:13,140 --> 00:11:15,470
that it's crept into Italians and all of
these things are probably Wikipedia

these things are probably Wikipedia

00:11:15,480 --> 00:11:17,810
these things are probably Wikipedia
articles in oh yeah cells oh yeah the

640
00:11:17,810 --> 00:11:17,820
articles in oh yeah cells oh yeah the
 

641
00:11:17,820 --> 00:11:19,370
articles in oh yeah cells oh yeah the
discussion of square brackets whole

642
00:11:19,370 --> 00:11:19,380
discussion of square brackets whole
 

643
00:11:19,380 --> 00:11:21,230
discussion of square brackets whole
discussion I'm sure on both the English

644
00:11:21,230 --> 00:11:21,240
discussion I'm sure on both the English
 

645
00:11:21,240 --> 00:11:24,110
discussion I'm sure on both the English
and the German Wikipedia and and then

646
00:11:24,110 --> 00:11:24,120
and the German Wikipedia and and then
 

647
00:11:24,120 --> 00:11:25,550
and the German Wikipedia and and then
difference between those two might be

648
00:11:25,550 --> 00:11:25,560
difference between those two might be
 

649
00:11:25,560 --> 00:11:28,850
difference between those two might be
very uh uh very interesting

650
00:11:28,850 --> 00:11:28,860
very uh uh very interesting
 

651
00:11:28,860 --> 00:11:31,069
very uh uh very interesting
so wikidata is fascinating but even the

652
00:11:31,069 --> 00:11:31,079
so wikidata is fascinating but even the
 

653
00:11:31,079 --> 00:11:33,410
so wikidata is fascinating but even the
broader discussion of uh what is an

654
00:11:33,410 --> 00:11:33,420
broader discussion of uh what is an
 

655
00:11:33,420 --> 00:11:35,870
broader discussion of uh what is an
encyclopedia can you go to that sort of

656
00:11:35,870 --> 00:11:35,880
encyclopedia can you go to that sort of
 

657
00:11:35,880 --> 00:11:37,910
encyclopedia can you go to that sort of
philosophical question of sure what is

658
00:11:37,910 --> 00:11:37,920
philosophical question of sure what is
 

659
00:11:37,920 --> 00:11:39,949
philosophical question of sure what is
what is it what is it what is this

660
00:11:39,949 --> 00:11:39,959
what is it what is it what is this
 

661
00:11:39,959 --> 00:11:42,350
what is it what is it what is this
encyclopedia so uh the way I would put

662
00:11:42,350 --> 00:11:42,360
encyclopedia so uh the way I would put
 

663
00:11:42,360 --> 00:11:45,170
encyclopedia so uh the way I would put
it is uh an encyclopedia or what our

664
00:11:45,170 --> 00:11:45,180
it is uh an encyclopedia or what our
 

665
00:11:45,180 --> 00:11:48,290
it is uh an encyclopedia or what our
goal is is the sum of all human

666
00:11:48,290 --> 00:11:48,300
goal is is the sum of all human
 

667
00:11:48,300 --> 00:11:50,870
goal is is the sum of all human
knowledge but some meaning summary

668
00:11:50,870 --> 00:11:50,880
knowledge but some meaning summary
 

669
00:11:50,880 --> 00:11:54,110
knowledge but some meaning summary
so and this was an early debate I mean

670
00:11:54,110 --> 00:11:54,120
so and this was an early debate I mean
 

671
00:11:54,120 --> 00:11:56,930
so and this was an early debate I mean
somebody started uploading uh the full

672
00:11:56,930 --> 00:11:56,940
somebody started uploading uh the full
 

673
00:11:56,940 --> 00:11:59,269
somebody started uploading uh the full
text of Hamlet for example and we said

674
00:11:59,269 --> 00:11:59,279
text of Hamlet for example and we said
 

675
00:11:59,279 --> 00:12:01,550
text of Hamlet for example and we said
wait hold on a second that's not an

676
00:12:01,550 --> 00:12:01,560
wait hold on a second that's not an
 

677
00:12:01,560 --> 00:12:03,829
wait hold on a second that's not an
encyclopedia article but why not

678
00:12:03,829 --> 00:12:03,839
encyclopedia article but why not
 

679
00:12:03,839 --> 00:12:06,889
encyclopedia article but why not
um so hence was born wikisource which is

680
00:12:06,889 --> 00:12:06,899
um so hence was born wikisource which is
 

681
00:12:06,899 --> 00:12:09,110
um so hence was born wikisource which is
where you put original texts and things

682
00:12:09,110 --> 00:12:09,120
where you put original texts and things
 

683
00:12:09,120 --> 00:12:11,329
where you put original texts and things
like that out of copyright text uh

684
00:12:11,329 --> 00:12:11,339
like that out of copyright text uh
 

685
00:12:11,339 --> 00:12:12,949
like that out of copyright text uh
because they said no an encyclopedia

686
00:12:12,949 --> 00:12:12,959
because they said no an encyclopedia
 

687
00:12:12,959 --> 00:12:14,750
because they said no an encyclopedia
article about Hamlet that's a perfectly

688
00:12:14,750 --> 00:12:14,760
article about Hamlet that's a perfectly
 

689
00:12:14,760 --> 00:12:16,250
article about Hamlet that's a perfectly
valid thing but the actual text of the

690
00:12:16,250 --> 00:12:16,260
valid thing but the actual text of the
 

691
00:12:16,260 --> 00:12:18,889
valid thing but the actual text of the
play is not an encyclopedia article so

692
00:12:18,889 --> 00:12:18,899
play is not an encyclopedia article so
 

693
00:12:18,899 --> 00:12:20,930
play is not an encyclopedia article so
most of it's fairly obvious but there

694
00:12:20,930 --> 00:12:20,940
most of it's fairly obvious but there
 

695
00:12:20,940 --> 00:12:22,490
most of it's fairly obvious but there
are some interesting quirks and

696
00:12:22,490 --> 00:12:22,500
are some interesting quirks and
 

697
00:12:22,500 --> 00:12:25,009
are some interesting quirks and
differences so for example as I

698
00:12:25,009 --> 00:12:25,019
differences so for example as I
 

699
00:12:25,019 --> 00:12:28,870
differences so for example as I

00:12:33,650 --> 00:12:33,660
quite common to have recipes which in
 

705
00:12:33,660 --> 00:12:34,910
quite common to have recipes which in
English language that would be unusual

706

and that's the sort of thing where uh
 

1487
00:27:55,740 --> 00:27:58,190
and that's the sort of thing where uh
you know we have to really think about

1488
00:27:58,190 --> 00:27:58,200
you know we have to really think about
 

1489
00:27:58,200 --> 00:28:01,010
you know we have to really think about
in a biography and about controversies

1490
00:28:01,010 --> 00:28:01,020
in a biography and about controversies
 

1491
00:28:01,020 --> 00:28:04,370
in a biography and about controversies
to say is this a real controversy so in

to say is this a real controversy so in
general like one of the things we we

1494
00:28:06,590 --> 00:28:06,600
general like one of the things we we
 

1495
00:28:06,600 --> 00:28:09,890
general like one of the things we we
tend to say is like any section so if

1496
00:28:09,890 --> 00:28:09,900
tend to say is like any section so if
 

1497
00:28:09,900 --> 00:28:11,930
tend to say is like any section so if
there's a biography and there's a

1498
00:28:11,930 --> 00:28:11,940
there's a biography and there's a
 

1499
00:28:11,940 --> 00:28:14,269
there's a biography and there's a
section called controversies that's

1500
00:28:14,269 --> 00:28:14,279
section called controversies that's
 

1501
00:28:14,279 --> 00:28:17,090
section called controversies that's
actually poor practice because it just

1502
00:28:17,090 --> 00:28:17,100
actually poor practice because it just
 

1503
00:28:17,100 --> 00:28:19,549

invites people to say oh I want to work
on this entry and let's see there's

1506
00:28:21,409 --> 00:28:21,419
on this entry and let's see there's
 

1507
00:28:21,419 --> 00:28:22,789
on this entry and let's see there's
seven sections so this one's quite short

1508
00:28:22,789 --> 00:28:22,799
seven sections so this one's quite short
 

1509
00:28:22,799 --> 00:28:24,529
seven sections so this one's quite short
can I add something right go out and

1510
00:28:24,529 --> 00:28:24,539
can I add something right go out and
 

1511
00:28:24,539 --> 00:28:25,789

find some more controversies that's
 

1513
00:28:25,799 --> 00:28:28,490
find some more controversies that's
nonsense right and in general putting it

1514
00:28:28,490 --> 00:28:28,500
nonsense right and in general putting it
 

1515
00:28:28,500 --> 00:28:30,230
nonsense right and in general putting it
separate from everything else kind of

1516
00:28:30,230 --> 00:28:30,240
separate from everything else kind of
 

1517
00:28:30,240 --> 00:28:31,669
separate from everything else kind of
makes it seem worse and also doesn't put

1518
00:28:31,669 --> 00:28:31,679
makes it seem worse and also doesn't put
 

1519
00:28:31,679 --> 00:28:33,649
makes it seem worse and also doesn't put
it in the right context whereas if it's

1520
00:28:33,649 --> 00:28:33,659
it in the right context whereas if it's
 

1521
00:28:33,659 --> 00:28:34,970
it in the right context whereas if it's
sort of a lie flow and there is a

1522
00:28:34,970 --> 00:28:34,980
sort of a lie flow and there is a
 

1523
00:28:34,980 --> 00:28:36,529
sort of a lie flow and there is a
controversy there's always potential

1524
00:28:36,529 --> 00:28:36,539
controversy there's always potential
 

1525
00:28:36,539 --> 00:28:39,169
controversy there's always potential
controversy for anyone uh it should just

1526
00:28:39,169 --> 00:28:39,179
controversy for anyone uh it should just
 

1527
00:28:39,179 --> 00:28:41,090
controversy for anyone uh it should just
be sort of worked into the overall

1528
00:28:41,090 --> 00:28:41,100
be sort of worked into the overall
 

1529
00:28:41,100 --> 00:28:42,769
be sort of worked into the overall
article because then it doesn't become a

1530
00:28:42,769 --> 00:28:42,779
article because then it doesn't become a
 

1531
00:28:42,779 --> 00:28:44,570

Temptation you can contextualize

1532
00:28:44,570 --> 00:28:44,580
Temptation you can contextualize
 

1533
00:28:44,580 --> 00:28:47,630
Temptation you can contextualize
appropriately and so forth so that's you

1534
00:28:47,630 --> 00:28:47,640
appropriately and so forth so that's you
 

1535
00:28:47,640 --> 00:28:48,350
appropriately and so forth so that's you
know

1536
00:28:48,350 --> 00:28:48,360

1541
00:28:52,679 --> 00:28:55,850
uh uh that's you know part of the whole

1542
00:28:55,850 --> 00:28:55,860
process but I think for me one of the

00:28:55,860 --> 00:28:58,190
process but I think for me one of the
most important things is is what I call

flaw and and you've alluded to it a
 

1585
00:29:47,460 --> 00:29:49,909
flaw and and you've alluded to it a

00:29:49,909 --> 00:29:49,919
little bit but it's like we know the
 

1587

and sort of eager focus on anything that
 

1601
00:30:09,179 --> 00:30:10,730
and sort of eager focus on anything that

but that makes it a little bit more
 

1609
00:30:15,120 --> 00:30:17,690
but that makes it a little bit more
challenging to say okay how do we how do

sources than a tabloid newspaper so you

1666
00:31:18,710 --> 00:31:18,720
sources than a tabloid newspaper so you

00:36:15,829 --> 00:36:15,839
I think one of the potentially powerful
 

1921
00:36:15,839 --> 00:36:17,630
I think one of the potentially powerful
tools

1922

well because it is quite good at this

1926
00:36:20,510 --> 00:36:20,520
well because it is quite good at this

well because it is quite good at this
I've played around with and practiced it

1928
00:36:22,670 --> 00:36:22,680
I've played around with and practiced it
 

1929
00:36:22,680 --> 00:36:26,329
I've played around with and practiced it
quite a lot but Chad gbt4 is is really

quite able to to take a passage
 

1933
00:36:28,800 --> 00:36:30,170
quite able to to take a passage
and

1934
00:36:30,170 --> 00:36:30,180
and
 

1935
00:36:30,180 --> 00:36:31,430
and
uh

1936
00:36:31,430 --> 00:36:31,440
uh
 

1937

1941
00:36:38,160 --> 00:36:40,550
rewrite it to be more neutral now it is
a bit uh hanadine and it's a bit you

1942
00:36:40,550 --> 00:36:40,560
a bit uh hanadine and it's a bit you
 

1943
00:36:40,560 --> 00:36:43,250
a bit uh hanadine and it's a bit you
know cliched so sometimes it just takes

1944
00:36:43,250 --> 00:36:43,260
know cliched so sometimes it just takes
 

1945
00:36:43,260 --> 00:36:44,690
know cliched so sometimes it just takes
the spirit out of something that's

1946
00:36:44,690 --> 00:36:44,700
the spirit out of something that's
 

1947
00:36:44,700 --> 00:36:47,089
the spirit out of something that's
actually not bad it's just like you know

1948
00:36:47,089 --> 00:36:47,099
actually not bad it's just like you know
 

1949
00:36:47,099 --> 00:36:48,890
actually not bad it's just like you know
poetic language and you're like okay

1950
00:36:48,890 --> 00:36:48,900
poetic language and you're like okay
 

1951
00:36:48,900 --> 00:36:51,290
poetic language and you're like okay
that's not actually helping but in many

1952
00:36:51,290 --> 00:36:51,300
that's not actually helping but in many
 

1953
00:36:51,300 --> 00:36:52,790
that's not actually helping but in many
cases I think that sort of thing is

1954
00:36:52,790 --> 00:36:52,800
cases I think that sort of thing is
 

1955
00:36:52,800 --> 00:36:53,750
cases I think that sort of thing is
quite interesting and I'm also

1956
00:36:53,750 --> 00:36:53,760
quite interesting and I'm also
 

1957
00:36:53,760 --> 00:36:55,550
quite interesting and I'm also
interested in

1958
00:36:55,550 --> 00:36:55,560
interested in
 

1959
00:36:55,560 --> 00:36:57,170
interested in
um you know

1960
00:36:57,170 --> 00:36:57,180
um you know
 

1961
00:36:57,180 --> 00:36:59,690
um you know
can you imagine where you you

1962
00:36:59,690 --> 00:36:59,700
can you imagine where you you
 

1963
00:36:59,700 --> 00:37:03,410
can you imagine where you you
feed in a Wikipedia entry and all the

1964
00:37:03,410 --> 00:37:03,420
feed in a Wikipedia entry and all the
 

1965
00:37:03,420 --> 00:37:04,370
feed in a Wikipedia entry and all the
sources

1966
00:37:04,370 --> 00:37:04,380
sources
 

1967
00:37:04,380 --> 00:37:06,230
sources
and you say

1968
00:37:06,230 --> 00:37:06,240
and you say
 

1969
00:37:06,240 --> 00:37:08,089
and you say
help me find anything in the article

1970
00:37:08,089 --> 00:37:08,099
help me find anything in the article
 

1971
00:37:08,099 --> 00:37:11,270
help me find anything in the article
that is not accurately reflecting what's

1972
00:37:11,270 --> 00:37:11,280
that is not accurately reflecting what's
 

1973
00:37:11,280 --> 00:37:13,370
that is not accurately reflecting what's
in the sources and that doesn't have to

1974
00:37:13,370 --> 00:37:13,380
in the sources and that doesn't have to
 

1975
00:37:13,380 --> 00:37:15,530
in the sources and that doesn't have to
be perfect it only has to be good enough

1976
00:37:15,530 --> 00:37:15,540
be perfect it only has to be good enough
 

1977
00:37:15,540 --> 00:37:18,770
be perfect it only has to be good enough
to be useful to community so if if it

1978
00:37:18,770 --> 00:37:18,780
to be useful to community so if if it
 

1979
00:37:18,780 --> 00:37:21,050
to be useful to community so if if it
scans an article and all the sources and

1980
00:37:21,050 --> 00:37:21,060
scans an article and all the sources and
 

1981
00:37:21,060 --> 00:37:23,450
scans an article and all the sources and
you say oh it came back with

1982
00:37:23,450 --> 00:37:23,460
you say oh it came back with
 

1983
00:37:23,460 --> 00:37:26,329
you say oh it came back with
10 suggestions and seven of them were

1984
00:37:26,329 --> 00:37:26,339
10 suggestions and seven of them were
 

1985
00:37:26,339 --> 00:37:27,829
10 suggestions and seven of them were
decent and three of them it just didn't

1986
00:37:27,829 --> 00:37:27,839
decent and three of them it just didn't
 

1987
00:37:27,839 --> 00:37:29,450
decent and three of them it just didn't
understand well actually that's probably

1988
00:37:29,450 --> 00:37:29,460
understand well actually that's probably
 

1989
00:37:29,460 --> 00:37:33,230
understand well actually that's probably
worth my time to do and it can help us

1990
00:37:33,230 --> 00:37:33,240
worth my time to do and it can help us
 

1991
00:37:33,240 --> 00:37:35,870
worth my time to do and it can help us
um you know really

1992
00:37:35,870 --> 00:37:35,880
um you know really
 

1993
00:37:35,880 --> 00:37:38,329
um you know really
um more quickly get good people to sort

1994
00:37:38,329 --> 00:37:38,339
um more quickly get good people to sort
 

1995
00:37:38,339 --> 00:37:41,150
um more quickly get good people to sort
of review obscure entries uh and things

1996
00:37:41,150 --> 00:37:41,160
of review obscure entries uh and things
 

1997
00:37:41,160 --> 00:37:43,910
of review obscure entries uh and things
like that so just as a small aside on

1998
00:37:43,910 --> 00:37:43,920
like that so just as a small aside on
 

1999
00:37:43,920 --> 00:37:45,170
like that so just as a small aside on
that and we'll probably talk about

2000
00:37:45,170 --> 00:37:45,180
that and we'll probably talk about
 

2001
00:37:45,180 --> 00:37:47,150
that and we'll probably talk about
language models a little bit uh or a lot

2002
00:37:47,150 --> 00:37:47,160
language models a little bit uh or a lot
 

2003
00:37:47,160 --> 00:37:50,510
language models a little bit uh or a lot
more but one of the Articles uh one of

2004
00:37:50,510 --> 00:37:50,520
more but one of the Articles uh one of
 

2005
00:37:50,520 --> 00:37:52,670

the head pieces about me uh the
 

2007
00:37:52,680 --> 00:37:54,650
the head pieces about me uh the
journalist actually was very

2008
00:37:54,650 --> 00:37:54,660
journalist actually was very
 

2009
00:37:54,660 --> 00:37:57,170

straightforward and honest about having
 

2011
00:37:57,180 --> 00:37:59,569
straightforward and honest about having
used GPT to write part of the article oh

2012
00:37:59,569 --> 00:37:59,579
used GPT to write part of the article oh
 

2013
00:37:59,579 --> 00:38:01,130
used GPT to write part of the article oh
interesting and then finding that it

2014
00:38:01,130 --> 00:38:01,140
interesting and then finding that it
 

2015
00:38:01,140 --> 00:38:02,990
interesting and then finding that it
made an error and apologized for the

2016
00:38:02,990 --> 00:38:03,000
made an error and apologized for the
 

2017
00:38:03,000 --> 00:38:06,290
made an error and apologized for the

00:38:06,290 --> 00:38:06,300
error the gpt4 generated which has this
 

2019
00:38:06,300 --> 00:38:08,870
error the gpt4 generated which has this
kind of interesting Loop which is the

2020
00:38:08,870 --> 00:38:08,880
kind of interesting Loop which is the
 

2021
00:38:08,880 --> 00:38:11,150
kind of interesting Loop which is the

00:38:14,280 --> 00:38:16,069
Pages GPT is trained on Wikipedia and
then there's like this um

2026
00:38:16,069 --> 00:38:16,079
then there's like this um
 

2027
00:38:16,079 --> 00:38:17,569
then there's like this um
interesting

2039
00:38:32,640 --> 00:38:35,810
of the language model new truths can be
created and kind of linger yeah there's

2040
00:38:35,810 --> 00:38:35,820
created and kind of linger yeah there's
 

2041
00:38:35,820 --> 00:38:39,250

licensing so in that sense of course
 

2211
00:41:45,599 --> 00:41:47,329

it's completely fine now we do worry a
 

2213
00:41:47,339 --> 00:41:49,490
it's completely fine now we do worry a
bit about attribution

2214
00:41:49,490 --> 00:41:49,500
bit about attribution
 

2215
00:41:49,500 --> 00:41:51,829
bit about attribution
um because it is a Creative Commons

2216
00:41:51,829 --> 00:41:51,839
um because it is a Creative Commons
 

2217
00:41:51,839 --> 00:41:54,910
um because it is a Creative Commons
attribution sharealike license so

2218
00:41:54,910 --> 00:41:54,920
attribution sharealike license so
 

2219
00:41:54,920 --> 00:41:56,630
attribution sharealike license so
attributes is important not just because

2220
00:41:56,630 --> 00:41:56,640
attributes is important not just because
 

2221
00:41:56,640 --> 00:41:58,130
attributes is important not just because
of our licensing model and things like

2222
00:41:58,130 --> 00:41:58,140
of our licensing model and things like
 

2223
00:41:58,140 --> 00:42:00,650
of our licensing model and things like
that but it's just proper attribution is

2224
00:42:00,650 --> 00:42:00,660
that but it's just proper attribution is
 

2225
00:42:00,660 --> 00:42:03,890
that but it's just proper attribution is
just good intellectual practice and so

2226
00:42:03,890 --> 00:42:03,900
just good intellectual practice and so
 

2227
00:42:03,900 --> 00:42:06,470
just good intellectual practice and so
and that's a really hard complicated

2228
00:42:06,470 --> 00:42:06,480
and that's a really hard complicated
 

2229
00:42:06,480 --> 00:42:07,730
and that's a really hard complicated
question

2230

particularly people at Google are really
 

2267
00:42:45,839 --> 00:42:46,910
particularly people at Google are really
keen on

keen on
 

2269
00:42:46,920 --> 00:42:49,910
keen on
figuring out grounding aesthetical terms

2270
00:42:49,910 --> 00:42:49,920
figuring out grounding aesthetical terms
 

2271
00:42:49,920 --> 00:42:52,190
figuring out grounding aesthetical terms
so ground any any text that's generated

trying to ground it to the Wikipedia
 

2275
00:42:56,000 --> 00:42:59,210
trying to ground it to the Wikipedia
quality source source I mean like the

2276
00:42:59,210 --> 00:42:59,220
quality source source I mean like the
 

2277
00:42:59,220 --> 00:43:00,710
quality source source I mean like the
same kind of standard of what a source

2278
00:43:00,710 --> 00:43:00,720
same kind of standard of what a source
 

2279
00:43:00,720 --> 00:43:03,530
same kind of standard of what a source
means that Wikipedia uses the same kind

2280
00:43:03,530 --> 00:43:03,540
means that Wikipedia uses the same kind
 

2281
00:43:03,540 --> 00:43:05,930
means that Wikipedia uses the same kind
of generating yeah the same kind of

00:43:05,930 --> 00:43:05,940
of generating yeah the same kind of
 

2283
00:43:05,940 --> 00:43:07,370
of generating yeah the same kind of
thing and of course one of the biggest

2284
00:43:07,370 --> 00:43:07,380
thing and of course one of the biggest
 

2285
00:43:07,380 --> 00:43:11,210
thing and of course one of the biggest
flaws in chargept right now

2286
00:43:11,210 --> 00:43:11,220
flaws in chargept right now
 

2287
00:43:11,220 --> 00:43:13,309
flaws in chargept right now
um is that it just literally will make

2288
00:43:13,309 --> 00:43:13,319
um is that it just literally will make
 

2289
00:43:13,319 --> 00:43:15,470
um is that it just literally will make
things up just to be

2290
00:43:15,470 --> 00:43:15,480
things up just to be
 

2291
00:43:15,480 --> 00:43:17,930
things up just to be
like amiable I think it's programmed to

2292
00:43:17,930 --> 00:43:17,940
like amiable I think it's programmed to
 

2293
00:43:17,940 --> 00:43:19,849
like amiable I think it's programmed to
be very hopeful and amiable and it

2294
00:43:19,849 --> 00:43:19,859
be very hopeful and amiable and it
 

2295
00:43:19,859 --> 00:43:21,290
be very hopeful and amiable and it
doesn't really know or care about the

2296
00:43:21,290 --> 00:43:21,300
doesn't really know or care about the
 

2297
00:43:21,300 --> 00:43:23,630
doesn't really know or care about the
truth and get bullied into uh yeah it

2298
00:43:23,630 --> 00:43:23,640
truth and get bullied into uh yeah it
 

2299
00:43:23,640 --> 00:43:26,030
truth and get bullied into uh yeah it
can kind of be convincing too well but

2300
00:43:26,030 --> 00:43:26,040
can kind of be convincing too well but
 

2301
00:43:26,040 --> 00:43:28,609
can kind of be convincing too well but
like this morning I I was the story I

2302
00:43:28,609 --> 00:43:28,619
like this morning I I was the story I
 

2303
00:43:28,619 --> 00:43:31,130
like this morning I I was the story I
was telling earlier about uh comparing a

2304
00:43:31,130 --> 00:43:31,140
was telling earlier about uh comparing a
 

2305
00:43:31,140 --> 00:43:33,170
was telling earlier about uh comparing a
football player to a Lamborghini and I

2306
00:43:33,170 --> 00:43:33,180
football player to a Lamborghini and I
 

2307
00:43:33,180 --> 00:43:34,849
football player to a Lamborghini and I
thought is that really racial I don't

2308
00:43:34,849 --> 00:43:34,859
thought is that really racial I don't
 

2309
00:43:34,859 --> 00:43:36,650
thought is that really racial I don't
know but I'm just I'm mulling it over

2310
00:43:36,650 --> 00:43:36,660
know but I'm just I'm mulling it over
 

2311
00:43:36,660 --> 00:43:38,690
know but I'm just I'm mulling it over
and I thought I'm gonna go to church BT

2312
00:43:38,690 --> 00:43:38,700
and I thought I'm gonna go to church BT
 

2313
00:43:38,700 --> 00:43:42,410
and I thought I'm gonna go to church BT
so I sent to church gbt4 I said uh you

2314
00:43:42,410 --> 00:43:42,420
so I sent to church gbt4 I said uh you
 

2315
00:43:42,420 --> 00:43:44,750
so I sent to church gbt4 I said uh you
know this this happened in Wikipedia can

2316
00:43:44,750 --> 00:43:44,760
know this this happened in Wikipedia can
 

2317
00:43:44,760 --> 00:43:47,690
know this this happened in Wikipedia can
you think of examples where a white

2318
00:43:47,690 --> 00:43:47,700
you think of examples where a white
 

2319
00:43:47,700 --> 00:43:51,230
you think of examples where a white
athlete has been compared to uh

2320
00:43:51,230 --> 00:43:51,240
athlete has been compared to uh
 

2321
00:43:51,240 --> 00:43:53,870
athlete has been compared to uh
a fast car inanimate object and it comes

2322
00:43:53,870 --> 00:43:53,880
a fast car inanimate object and it comes
 

2323
00:43:53,880 --> 00:43:55,970
a fast car inanimate object and it comes
back as a very plausible essay where it

2324
00:43:55,970 --> 00:43:55,980
back as a very plausible essay where it
 

2325
00:43:55,980 --> 00:43:57,710
back as a very plausible essay where it
tells you know why these analogies are

2326
00:43:57,710 --> 00:43:57,720
tells you know why these analogies are
 

2327
00:43:57,720 --> 00:43:59,450
tells you know why these analogies are
common and support mobile I said no no I

2328
00:43:59,450 --> 00:43:59,460
common and support mobile I said no no I
 

2329
00:43:59,460 --> 00:44:00,650
common and support mobile I said no no I
really uh could you give me some

2330
00:44:00,650 --> 00:44:00,660
really uh could you give me some
 

2331
00:44:00,660 --> 00:44:02,930
really uh could you give me some
specific examples so it gives me three

2332
00:44:02,930 --> 00:44:02,940
specific examples so it gives me three
 

2333
00:44:02,940 --> 00:44:05,390
specific examples so it gives me three
specific examples very plausible correct

2334
00:44:05,390 --> 00:44:05,400
specific examples very plausible correct
 

2335
00:44:05,400 --> 00:44:07,730
specific examples very plausible correct
names of athletes and contemporaries and

2336
00:44:07,730 --> 00:44:07,740
names of athletes and contemporaries and
 

2337
00:44:07,740 --> 00:44:09,589
names of athletes and contemporaries and
all of that could have been true Googled

2338
00:44:09,589 --> 00:44:09,599
all of that could have been true Googled
 

2339
00:44:09,599 --> 00:44:11,329
all of that could have been true Googled
every single quote none of them existed

2340
00:44:11,329 --> 00:44:11,339
every single quote none of them existed
 

2341
00:44:11,339 --> 00:44:13,670
every single quote none of them existed
and so I'm like well that's really not

2342
00:44:13,670 --> 00:44:13,680
and so I'm like well that's really not
 

2343
00:44:13,680 --> 00:44:16,910
and so I'm like well that's really not
good like I I wanted to explore a

2344
00:44:16,910 --> 00:44:16,920
good like I I wanted to explore a
 

2345
00:44:16,920 --> 00:44:19,190
good like I I wanted to explore a
thought process I was in I thought hi I

2346
00:44:19,190 --> 00:44:19,200
thought process I was in I thought hi I
 

2347
00:44:19,200 --> 00:44:20,390
thought process I was in I thought hi I
thought first I thought how do I Google

2348
00:44:20,390 --> 00:44:20,400
thought first I thought how do I Google
 

2349
00:44:20,400 --> 00:44:21,710
thought first I thought how do I Google
and say well it's kind of a hard thing

2350
00:44:21,710 --> 00:44:21,720
and say well it's kind of a hard thing
 

2351
00:44:21,720 --> 00:44:22,849
and say well it's kind of a hard thing
to Google Because unless somebody's

2352
00:44:22,849 --> 00:44:22,859
to Google Because unless somebody's

2355
00:44:24,480 --> 00:44:27,050
written about this specific topic it's
you know oh it's large language model it

2356
00:44:27,050 --> 00:44:27,060
you know oh it's large language model it
 

2357
00:44:27,060 --> 00:44:28,490
you know oh it's large language model it

more complicated than that and is it
again we go back to is it undue wait uh

again we go back to is it undue wait uh
 

2769

again we go back to is it undue wait uh
you know if

oh this person should be in the category
 

2785
00:52:31,319 --> 00:52:33,410
oh this person should be in the category
of American criminals because you think

2786
00:52:33,410 --> 00:52:33,420

it's against the law to drive under the
 

2791
00:52:37,920 --> 00:52:39,589
it's against the law to drive under the
influence of alcohol and you were

2792
00:52:39,589 --> 00:52:39,599
influence of alcohol and you were
 

2793
00:52:39,599 --> 00:52:41,450

arrested and you
spent a month in prison or whatever but

2796
00:52:43,730 --> 00:52:43,740

2797
00:52:43,740 --> 00:52:46,309
spent a month in prison or whatever but
it's odd to say that's a criminal so it

2798
00:52:46,309 --> 00:52:46,319
it's odd to say that's a criminal so it
 

2799
00:52:46,319 --> 00:52:49,130
it's odd to say that's a criminal so it
just says like example in this area is

2800
00:52:49,130 --> 00:52:49,140
just says like example in this area is
 

2801
00:52:49,140 --> 00:52:49,849
just says like example in this area is
um

his first sort of famous name who I
wouldn't think should be listed as in

2810
00:52:58,549 --> 00:52:58,559

sort of quite extreme accusations of
 

2917
00:54:56,700 --> 00:55:00,049
sort of quite extreme accusations of
bias and I think you know actually I

2918
00:55:00,049 --> 00:55:00,059
bias and I think you know actually I
 

2919
00:55:00,059 --> 00:55:01,790
bias and I think you know actually I
just I don't see it I don't buy that and

2920
00:55:01,790 --> 00:55:01,800
just I don't see it I don't buy that and
 

2921
00:55:01,800 --> 00:55:04,190
just I don't see it I don't buy that and

time you go to any serious
 

2985

time you go to any serious
uh political controversy

uh political controversy
 

2987
00:56:19,740 --> 00:56:21,530
uh political controversy
we should have a pretty balanced

2988
00:56:21,530 --> 00:56:21,540
we should have a pretty balanced
 

2989
00:56:21,540 --> 00:56:24,470
we should have a pretty balanced
perspective on who's saying what what

2990
00:56:24,470 --> 00:56:24,480
perspective on who's saying what what
 

2991
00:56:24,480 --> 00:56:26,750
perspective on who's saying what what
the views are and so forth I would

2992
00:56:26,750 --> 00:56:26,760
the views are and so forth I would
 

2993
00:56:26,760 --> 00:56:28,790
the views are and so forth I would
actually argue that the

2994
00:56:28,790 --> 00:56:28,800
actually argue that the
 

2995
00:56:28,800 --> 00:56:31,849
actually argue that the
the the areas where we are more likely

2996
00:56:31,849 --> 00:56:31,859
the the areas where we are more likely
 

2997
00:56:31,859 --> 00:56:34,130
the the areas where we are more likely
to have bias that persists for a long

2998
00:56:34,130 --> 00:56:34,140
to have bias that persists for a long
 

2999
00:56:34,140 --> 00:56:35,930
to have bias that persists for a long
period of time are actually

3000
00:56:35,930 --> 00:56:35,940
period of time are actually
 

3001
00:56:35,940 --> 00:56:38,569
period of time are actually
fairly obscure things or maybe fairly

3002
00:56:38,569 --> 00:56:38,579
fairly obscure things or maybe fairly
 

3003
00:56:38,579 --> 00:56:40,670
fairly obscure things or maybe fairly
non-political things so I just give it's

3004
00:56:40,670 --> 00:56:40,680
non-political things so I just give it's
 

3005
00:56:40,680 --> 00:56:42,829
non-political things so I just give it's
kind of a humorous example but it's it's

3006
00:56:42,829 --> 00:56:42,839
kind of a humorous example but it's it's
 

3007
00:56:42,839 --> 00:56:44,450
kind of a humorous example but it's it's
meaningful

3008
00:56:44,450 --> 00:56:44,460
meaningful
 

3009
00:56:44,460 --> 00:56:47,930
meaningful

disputes about what's better or not you
 

3033
00:57:09,119 --> 00:57:11,329
disputes about what's better or not you
know but in general they're quite

3034
00:57:11,329 --> 00:57:11,339
know but in general they're quite
 

3035
00:57:11,339 --> 00:57:12,890
know but in general they're quite
positive because nobody actually cares

positive because nobody actually cares
 

3037
00:57:12,900 --> 00:57:15,170

on anything that people
 

3039
00:57:15,180 --> 00:57:17,870
on anything that people
quite passionate about then hopefully

3040
00:57:17,870 --> 00:57:17,880
quite passionate about then hopefully
 

3041

quite passionate about then hopefully
you know there's like quite a lot of

3042

you know there's like quite a lot of
 

3043
00:57:19,920 --> 00:57:21,410
you know there's like quite a lot of
interesting stuff so I'll give an

3044
00:57:21,410 --> 00:57:21,420
interesting stuff so I'll give an
 

3045
00:57:21,420 --> 00:57:23,210
interesting stuff so I'll give an
example a contemporary example where I

3046
00:57:23,210 --> 00:57:23,220
example a contemporary example where I
 

3047
00:57:23,220 --> 00:57:25,490
example a contemporary example where I
think we've done a good job as of my

3048
00:57:25,490 --> 00:57:25,500
think we've done a good job as of my
 

3049
00:57:25,500 --> 00:57:28,370
think we've done a good job as of my
most recent sort of look at it and that

3050
00:57:28,370 --> 00:57:28,380
most recent sort of look at it and that
 

3051
00:57:28,380 --> 00:57:31,130
most recent sort of look at it and that
is the the question about the efficacy

3052
00:57:31,130 --> 00:57:31,140
is the the question about the efficacy
 

3053
00:57:31,140 --> 00:57:34,430
is the the question about the efficacy
of masks during the covet pandemic and

3054
00:57:34,430 --> 00:57:34,440
of masks during the covet pandemic and
 

3055
00:57:34,440 --> 00:57:36,290
of masks during the covet pandemic and
that's an area where I would say the

3056
00:57:36,290 --> 00:57:36,300
that's an area where I would say the
 

3057
00:57:36,300 --> 00:57:40,130
that's an area where I would say the
public authorities really kind of jerked

3058
00:57:40,130 --> 00:57:40,140
public authorities really kind of jerked
 

3059
00:57:40,140 --> 00:57:42,049
public authorities really kind of jerked
us all around a bit you know in the very

3060
00:57:42,049 --> 00:57:42,059
us all around a bit you know in the very
 

3061
00:57:42,059 --> 00:57:43,309
us all around a bit you know in the very
first days they said whatever you do

3062
00:57:43,309 --> 00:57:43,319
first days they said whatever you do
 

3063
00:57:43,319 --> 00:57:46,069
first days they said whatever you do
don't rush out and buy masks

3064
00:57:46,069 --> 00:57:46,079
don't rush out and buy masks
 

3065
00:57:46,079 --> 00:57:48,130
don't rush out and buy masks
um and their concern was

3066
00:57:48,130 --> 00:57:48,140
um and their concern was
 

3067
00:57:48,140 --> 00:57:51,170
um and their concern was
uh shortages in hospitals okay but fair

3068
00:57:51,170 --> 00:57:51,180
uh shortages in hospitals okay but fair
 

3069
00:57:51,180 --> 00:57:53,510
uh shortages in hospitals okay but fair
enough later it's like no everybody's

3070
00:57:53,510 --> 00:57:53,520
enough later it's like no everybody's
 

3071
00:57:53,520 --> 00:57:55,609
enough later it's like no everybody's
got to wear a mask everywhere it's it

3072
00:57:55,609 --> 00:57:55,619
got to wear a mask everywhere it's it
 

3073
00:57:55,619 --> 00:57:57,410
got to wear a mask everywhere it's it
really works really well and it's you

3074
00:57:57,410 --> 00:57:57,420
really works really well and it's you
 

3075
00:57:57,420 --> 00:57:59,870
really works really well and it's you
know then now I think it's the evidence

3076
00:57:59,870 --> 00:57:59,880
know then now I think it's the evidence
 

3077
00:57:59,880 --> 00:58:02,510
know then now I think it's the evidence
is mixed right Mass seemed to help in my

3078
00:58:02,510 --> 00:58:02,520
is mixed right Mass seemed to help in my
 

3079
00:58:02,520 --> 00:58:03,950
is mixed right Mass seemed to help in my
personal view Mass seemed to help

3080
00:58:03,950 --> 00:58:03,960
personal view Mass seemed to help
 

3081
00:58:03,960 --> 00:58:06,530
personal view Mass seemed to help
they're no huge burden you know you

3082
00:58:06,530 --> 00:58:06,540
they're no huge burden you know you
 

3083
00:58:06,540 --> 00:58:08,210
they're no huge burden you know you
might as well wear a mask in any

3084
00:58:08,210 --> 00:58:08,220
might as well wear a mask in any
 

3085
00:58:08,220 --> 00:58:10,370
might as well wear a mask in any
environment where you're with a giant

3086
00:58:10,370 --> 00:58:10,380
environment where you're with a giant
 

3087
00:58:10,380 --> 00:58:12,890
environment where you're with a giant
crowd of people and so forth

3088
00:58:12,890 --> 00:58:12,900
crowd of people and so forth
 

3089
00:58:12,900 --> 00:58:15,049
crowd of people and so forth
um but it's very politicized that one

3090
00:58:15,049 --> 00:58:15,059
um but it's very politicized that one
 

3091
00:58:15,059 --> 00:58:18,170
um but it's very politicized that one
and it's very politicized where uh

3092
00:58:18,170 --> 00:58:18,180
and it's very politicized where uh
 

3093
00:58:18,180 --> 00:58:21,170
and it's very politicized where uh
certainly in the U.S you know much more

3094
00:58:21,170 --> 00:58:21,180
certainly in the U.S you know much more
 

3095
00:58:21,180 --> 00:58:22,970
certainly in the U.S you know much more
so I mean I live in in the UK I live in

3096
00:58:22,970 --> 00:58:22,980
so I mean I live in in the UK I live in
 

3097
00:58:22,980 --> 00:58:25,069
so I mean I live in in the UK I live in
London I've never seen kind of on the

3098
00:58:25,069 --> 00:58:25,079
London I've never seen kind of on the
 

3099
00:58:25,079 --> 00:58:26,930
London I've never seen kind of on the
streets sort of

3100
00:58:26,930 --> 00:58:26,940
streets sort of
 

3101
00:58:26,940 --> 00:58:28,730
streets sort of
the kind of thing that I there's a lot

3102
00:58:28,730 --> 00:58:28,740
the kind of thing that I there's a lot
 

3103
00:58:28,740 --> 00:58:30,950
the kind of thing that I there's a lot
of reports of people actively angry

3104
00:58:30,950 --> 00:58:30,960
of reports of people actively angry
 

3105
00:58:30,960 --> 00:58:33,410
of reports of people actively angry
because someone else is wearing a mask

3106
00:58:33,410 --> 00:58:33,420
because someone else is wearing a mask
 

3107
00:58:33,420 --> 00:58:35,750
because someone else is wearing a mask
um that sort of thing in public

3108
00:58:35,750 --> 00:58:35,760
um that sort of thing in public
 

3109
00:58:35,760 --> 00:58:36,530
um that sort of thing in public
um

3110
00:58:36,530 --> 00:58:36,540
um
 

3111
00:58:36,540 --> 00:58:38,150
um
and so because it became very

3112
00:58:38,150 --> 00:58:38,160
and so because it became very
 

3113
00:58:38,160 --> 00:58:41,329
and so because it became very
politicized then clearly if if Wikipedia

3114
00:58:41,329 --> 00:58:41,339
politicized then clearly if if Wikipedia
 

3115
00:58:41,339 --> 00:58:43,549
politicized then clearly if if Wikipedia
no if you go to Wikipedia and you

3116
00:58:43,549 --> 00:58:43,559
no if you go to Wikipedia and you
 

3117
00:58:43,559 --> 00:58:45,049
no if you go to Wikipedia and you
research this topic I think you'll find

3118
00:58:45,049 --> 00:58:45,059
research this topic I think you'll find
 

3119
00:58:45,059 --> 00:58:46,309
research this topic I think you'll find
more or less what I've just said I'm

3120
00:58:46,309 --> 00:58:46,319
more or less what I've just said I'm
 

3121
00:58:46,319 --> 00:58:49,130
more or less what I've just said I'm
like um actually after it's all you know

3122
00:58:49,130 --> 00:58:49,140
like um actually after it's all you know
 

3123
00:58:49,140 --> 00:58:51,650
like um actually after it's all you know
to this point in history it's mixed

3124
00:58:51,650 --> 00:58:51,660
to this point in history it's mixed
 

3125
00:58:51,660 --> 00:58:53,329
to this point in history it's mixed
evidence like Mass seemed to help but

3126
00:58:53,329 --> 00:58:53,339
evidence like Mass seemed to help but
 

3127
00:58:53,339 --> 00:58:54,470
evidence like Mass seemed to help but
maybe not as much as some of the

3128
00:58:54,470 --> 00:58:54,480
maybe not as much as some of the
 

3129
00:58:54,480 --> 00:58:56,809
maybe not as much as some of the
authorities said and and here we are

3130
00:58:56,809 --> 00:58:56,819
authorities said and and here we are
 

3131
00:58:56,819 --> 00:58:58,849
authorities said and and here we are
and that's kind of an example where I

3132
00:58:58,849 --> 00:58:58,859
and that's kind of an example where I
 

3133
00:58:58,859 --> 00:59:00,770
and that's kind of an example where I
think okay we've done a good job but I

3134
00:59:00,770 --> 00:59:00,780
think okay we've done a good job but I
 

3135
00:59:00,780 --> 00:59:02,930
think okay we've done a good job but I
suspect there are people on both sides

3136
00:59:02,930 --> 00:59:02,940
suspect there are people on both sides
 

3137
00:59:02,940 --> 00:59:04,910
suspect there are people on both sides
of that very emotional debate who think

3138
00:59:04,910 --> 00:59:04,920
of that very emotional debate who think
 

3139
00:59:04,920 --> 00:59:07,130
of that very emotional debate who think
this is ridiculous hopefully we've got

3140
00:59:07,130 --> 00:59:07,140
this is ridiculous hopefully we've got
 

3141
00:59:07,140 --> 00:59:09,650
this is ridiculous hopefully we've got
quality sources so then hopefully those

3142
00:59:09,650 --> 00:59:09,660
quality sources so then hopefully those
 

3143
00:59:09,660 --> 00:59:11,349
quality sources so then hopefully those
people who read this can say oh actually

3144
00:59:11,349 --> 00:59:11,359
people who read this can say oh actually
 

3145
00:59:11,359 --> 00:59:14,750
people who read this can say oh actually
you know it is complicated you know if

3146
00:59:14,750 --> 00:59:14,760
you know it is complicated you know if
 

3147
00:59:14,760 --> 00:59:16,370
you know it is complicated you know if
you can get to the point of saying okay

3148
00:59:16,370 --> 00:59:16,380
you can get to the point of saying okay
 

3149
00:59:16,380 --> 00:59:18,589
you can get to the point of saying okay
this is I have my view but I understand

3150
00:59:18,589 --> 00:59:18,599
this is I have my view but I understand
 

3151
00:59:18,599 --> 00:59:20,990
this is I have my view but I understand
other views and I do think it's a

3152
00:59:20,990 --> 00:59:21,000
other views and I do think it's a
 

3153
00:59:21,000 --> 00:59:23,210
other views and I do think it's a
complicated question great now we're a

3154
00:59:23,210 --> 00:59:23,220
complicated question great now we're a
 

3155
00:59:23,220 --> 00:59:25,069
complicated question great now we're a
little bit more mature as a society well

3156
00:59:25,069 --> 00:59:25,079
little bit more mature as a society well
 

3157
00:59:25,079 --> 00:59:27,170
little bit more mature as a society well
that one is an interesting one because I

3158
00:59:27,170 --> 00:59:27,180
that one is an interesting one because I
 

3159
00:59:27,180 --> 00:59:29,630
that one is an interesting one because I
feel like I hope that that article also

3160
00:59:29,630 --> 00:59:29,640
feel like I hope that that article also
 

3161
00:59:29,640 --> 00:59:32,329
feel like I hope that that article also
contains the meta conversation about the

3162
00:59:32,329 --> 00:59:32,339
contains the meta conversation about the
 

3163
00:59:32,339 --> 00:59:34,789
contains the meta conversation about the
politicization of that topic yeah to me

3164
00:59:34,789 --> 00:59:34,799
politicization of that topic yeah to me
 

3165
00:59:34,799 --> 00:59:36,289
politicization of that topic yeah to me
it's almost more interesting than what

3166
00:59:36,289 --> 00:59:36,299
it's almost more interesting than what
 

3167
00:59:36,299 --> 00:59:38,450
it's almost more interesting than what

the masks work or not as at least at
 

3169
00:59:38,460 --> 00:59:41,210
the masks work or not as at least at
this point is like why it became masks

3170
00:59:41,210 --> 00:59:41,220
this point is like why it became masks
 

3171
00:59:41,220 --> 00:59:45,049
this point is like why it became masks
became a symbol of the oppression of a

3172
00:59:45,049 --> 00:59:45,059
became a symbol of the oppression of a

um and I don't I don't know in broader
 

3193
01:00:18,000 --> 01:00:19,430
um and I don't I don't know in broader
in the broader world like how do we

3194
01:00:19,430 --> 01:00:19,440
in the broader world like how do we
 

3195
01:00:19,440 --> 01:00:20,990
in the broader world like how do we
start to fix that that's a really hard

3196
01:00:20,990 --> 01:00:21,000
start to fix that that's a really hard
 

3197
01:00:21,000 --> 01:00:23,450
start to fix that that's a really hard
question well at every moment because

3198
01:00:23,450 --> 01:00:23,460
question well at every moment because
 

3199
01:00:23,460 --> 01:00:25,910
question well at every moment because
you mentioned mainstream and Fringe

3200
01:00:25,910 --> 01:00:25,920
you mentioned mainstream and Fringe
 

3201
01:00:25,920 --> 01:00:28,370
you mentioned mainstream and Fringe
there seems to be attention here and I

3202

there seems to be attention here and I
 

3203
01:00:28,380 --> 01:00:30,589
there seems to be attention here and I
wonder what your philosophy is on it

3204
01:00:30,589 --> 01:00:30,599
wonder what your philosophy is on it
 

3205
01:00:30,599 --> 01:00:32,630
wonder what your philosophy is on it
because there's mainstream ideas and

3206
01:00:32,630 --> 01:00:32,640
because there's mainstream ideas and
 

3207
01:00:32,640 --> 01:00:34,730
because there's mainstream ideas and
there's Fringe ideas uh you look at lab

3208
01:00:34,730 --> 01:00:34,740
there's Fringe ideas uh you look at lab
 

3209
01:00:34,740 --> 01:00:38,450
there's Fringe ideas uh you look at lab
leak Theory uh for this virus that could

3210
01:00:38,450 --> 01:00:38,460
leak Theory uh for this virus that could
 

3211
01:00:38,460 --> 01:00:41,589
leak Theory uh for this virus that could
be other things we can discuss

3212
01:00:41,589 --> 01:00:41,599
be other things we can discuss
 

3213
01:00:41,599 --> 01:00:44,569
be other things we can discuss
where there's a mainstream narrative

3214
01:00:44,569 --> 01:00:44,579
where there's a mainstream narrative
 

3215
01:00:44,579 --> 01:00:48,170
where there's a mainstream narrative
well if you just look at the percent

3216
01:00:48,170 --> 01:00:48,180
well if you just look at the percent
 

3217
01:00:48,180 --> 01:00:50,270
well if you just look at the percent
of the population

3218
01:00:50,270 --> 01:00:50,280
of the population
 

3219
01:00:50,280 --> 01:00:52,730
of the population
or the population with platforms what

3220
01:00:52,730 --> 01:00:52,740
or the population with platforms what
 

3221
01:00:52,740 --> 01:00:56,390
or the population with platforms what
they say and then uh what is a small

3222
01:00:56,390 --> 01:00:56,400
they say and then uh what is a small
 

3223
01:00:56,400 --> 01:00:59,150
they say and then uh what is a small
percentage in opposition to that and

3224
01:00:59,150 --> 01:00:59,160
percentage in opposition to that and
 

3225
01:00:59,160 --> 01:01:02,270
percentage in opposition to that and
what does Wikipedia's responsibility to

3226
01:01:02,270 --> 01:01:02,280
what does Wikipedia's responsibility to
 

3227
01:01:02,280 --> 01:01:04,190
what does Wikipedia's responsibility to
accurately represent both the mainstream

3228
01:01:04,190 --> 01:01:04,200
accurately represent both the mainstream
 

3229
01:01:04,200 --> 01:01:05,809
accurately represent both the mainstream
and the French do you think well I mean

3230
01:01:05,809 --> 01:01:05,819
and the French do you think well I mean
 

3231
01:01:05,819 --> 01:01:08,030
and the French do you think well I mean
I I think we we have to try to do our

3232
01:01:08,030 --> 01:01:08,040
I I think we we have to try to do our
 

3233
01:01:08,040 --> 01:01:10,670
I I think we we have to try to do our
best to to recognize both but also to

3234
01:01:10,670 --> 01:01:10,680
best to to recognize both but also to
 

3235
01:01:10,680 --> 01:01:14,150
best to to recognize both but also to
appropriately contextualize and so this

3236
01:01:14,150 --> 01:01:14,160
appropriately contextualize and so this
 

3237
01:01:14,160 --> 01:01:15,170
appropriately contextualize and so this
can be quite hard particularly when

3238
01:01:15,170 --> 01:01:15,180
can be quite hard particularly when
 

3239
01:01:15,180 --> 01:01:17,030
can be quite hard particularly when
emotions are high that's just a fact

3240
01:01:17,030 --> 01:01:17,040
emotions are high that's just a fact
 

3241
01:01:17,040 --> 01:01:19,130
emotions are high that's just a fact
about human beings

3242
01:01:19,130 --> 01:01:19,140
about human beings
 

3243
01:01:19,140 --> 01:01:21,349
about human beings
um I'll give a simpler example because

3244
01:01:21,349 --> 01:01:21,359
um I'll give a simpler example because
 

3245
01:01:21,359 --> 01:01:22,970
um I'll give a simpler example because
there's not a lot of emotion around it

3246
01:01:22,970 --> 01:01:22,980
there's not a lot of emotion around it
 

3247
01:01:22,980 --> 01:01:27,109
there's not a lot of emotion around it
like our entry on the moon doesn't say

3248
01:01:27,109 --> 01:01:27,119
like our entry on the moon doesn't say
 

3249
01:01:27,119 --> 01:01:29,150
like our entry on the moon doesn't say
some say the moon's made of rocks some

3250
01:01:29,150 --> 01:01:29,160
some say the moon's made of rocks some
 

3251
01:01:29,160 --> 01:01:31,130
some say the moon's made of rocks some
say cheese you know who knows that kind

3252
01:01:31,130 --> 01:01:31,140
say cheese you know who knows that kind
 

3253
01:01:31,140 --> 01:01:34,490
say cheese you know who knows that kind
of false neutrality is not what we want

3254
01:01:34,490 --> 01:01:34,500
of false neutrality is not what we want
 

3255
01:01:34,500 --> 01:01:36,170
of false neutrality is not what we want
to get to like that doesn't make any

3256
01:01:36,170 --> 01:01:36,180
to get to like that doesn't make any
 

3257
01:01:36,180 --> 01:01:38,270
to get to like that doesn't make any
sense but that one's easy like we all

3258
01:01:38,270 --> 01:01:38,280
sense but that one's easy like we all
 

3259
01:01:38,280 --> 01:01:39,950
sense but that one's easy like we all
understand

3260
01:01:39,950 --> 01:01:39,960
understand
 

3261
01:01:39,960 --> 01:01:41,510
understand
um I think there is a Wikipedia entry

3262
01:01:41,510 --> 01:01:41,520
um I think there is a Wikipedia entry
 

3263
01:01:41,520 --> 01:01:43,130
um I think there is a Wikipedia entry
called something like the moon is made

3264
01:01:43,130 --> 01:01:43,140
called something like the moon is made
 

3265
01:01:43,140 --> 01:01:45,589
called something like the moon is made
of cheese where it talks about this is a

3266
01:01:45,589 --> 01:01:45,599
of cheese where it talks about this is a
 

3267

um but
 

3279
01:01:58,079 --> 01:02:01,250
um but
nobody thinks wow like Wikipedia is so

3280
01:02:01,250 --> 01:02:01,260
nobody thinks wow like Wikipedia is so
 

3281
01:02:01,260 --> 01:02:02,930
nobody thinks wow like Wikipedia is so
one-sided it doesn't even acknowledge

3282
01:02:02,930 --> 01:02:02,940
one-sided it doesn't even acknowledge
 

3283
01:02:02,940 --> 01:02:04,970
one-sided it doesn't even acknowledge
the cheese Theory

3284
01:02:04,970 --> 01:02:04,980
the cheese Theory
 

3285
01:02:04,980 --> 01:02:07,069
the cheese Theory
um I say the same thing about Flat Earth

3286
01:02:07,069 --> 01:02:07,079
um I say the same thing about Flat Earth
 

3287

to make it what I want to know it's all

3346
01:03:10,849 --> 01:03:10,859
to make it what I want to know it's all
 

3347

to make it what I want to know it's all
spread out what I want to know is what's

01:03:14,990 --> 01:03:15,000
on the other side Jimmy what's on the
 

3351
01:03:15,000 --> 01:03:17,329
on the other side Jimmy what's on the
other side that's what all of us want to

3352
01:03:17,329 --> 01:03:17,339
other side that's what all of us want to
 

3353
01:03:17,339 --> 01:03:19,190
other side that's what all of us want to
know yeah

3354
01:03:19,190 --> 01:03:19,200
know yeah
 

3355
01:03:19,200 --> 01:03:19,789
know yeah
um

3356
01:03:19,789 --> 01:03:19,799
um
 

3357
01:03:19,799 --> 01:03:22,010
um
so there's some I presume there's

3358
01:03:22,010 --> 01:03:22,020
so there's some I presume there's
 

3359
01:03:22,020 --> 01:03:24,289
so there's some I presume there's
probably a small section about the

3360
01:03:24,289 --> 01:03:24,299
probably a small section about the
 

3361
01:03:24,299 --> 01:03:26,270
probably a small section about the
conspiracy theory of Flat Earth because

3362
01:03:26,270 --> 01:03:26,280
conspiracy theory of Flat Earth because
 

3363
01:03:26,280 --> 01:03:27,950
conspiracy theory of Flat Earth because
I think there's a sizeable percent of

3364
01:03:27,950 --> 01:03:27,960
I think there's a sizeable percent of
 

3365
01:03:27,960 --> 01:03:30,230
I think there's a sizeable percent of
the population who at least will say

3366
01:03:30,230 --> 01:03:30,240
the population who at least will say
 

3367
01:03:30,240 --> 01:03:32,390
the population who at least will say
they believe in a flat Earth yeah I I

3368
01:03:32,390 --> 01:03:32,400
they believe in a flat Earth yeah I I
 

3369
01:03:32,400 --> 01:03:35,210
they believe in a flat Earth yeah I I
think it is a movement

3370
01:03:35,210 --> 01:03:35,220
think it is a movement
 

3371
01:03:35,220 --> 01:03:37,430
think it is a movement
um that just says that the mainstream

3372
01:03:37,430 --> 01:03:37,440
um that just says that the mainstream
 

3373
01:03:37,440 --> 01:03:38,569
um that just says that the mainstream
narrative

3374
01:03:38,569 --> 01:03:38,579
narrative
 

3375
01:03:38,579 --> 01:03:40,910
narrative
to have distrust and skepticism about

3376
01:03:40,910 --> 01:03:40,920
to have distrust and skepticism about
 

3377
01:03:40,920 --> 01:03:42,650
to have distrust and skepticism about
the mainstream narrative which to a very

3378
01:03:42,650 --> 01:03:42,660
the mainstream narrative which to a very
 

3379
01:03:42,660 --> 01:03:44,089
the mainstream narrative which to a very
small degree is probably a very

3380
01:03:44,089 --> 01:03:44,099
small degree is probably a very
 

3381
01:03:44,099 --> 01:03:45,829
small degree is probably a very
productive thing to do it's part of the

3382
01:03:45,829 --> 01:03:45,839
productive thing to do it's part of the
 

3383
01:03:45,839 --> 01:03:48,170
productive thing to do it's part of the
scientific process but you can get a

3384
01:03:48,170 --> 01:03:48,180
scientific process but you can get a
 

3385
01:03:48,180 --> 01:03:50,030
scientific process but you can get a
little silly and ridiculous with it yeah

3386
01:03:50,030 --> 01:03:50,040
little silly and ridiculous with it yeah
 

3387
01:03:50,040 --> 01:03:53,630
little silly and ridiculous with it yeah
I mean yeah it it it's exactly right and

3388
01:03:53,630 --> 01:03:53,640
I mean yeah it it it's exactly right and
 

3389
01:03:53,640 --> 01:03:55,010
I mean yeah it it it's exactly right and
so

3390
01:03:55,010 --> 01:03:55,020
so
 

3391
01:03:55,020 --> 01:03:58,250
so
um you know I I think I find on on many

3392
01:03:58,250 --> 01:03:58,260
um you know I I think I find on on many
 

3393
01:03:58,260 --> 01:04:00,289
um you know I I think I find on on many
many cases and of course I like anybody

3394
01:04:00,289 --> 01:04:00,299
many cases and of course I like anybody
 

3395
01:04:00,299 --> 01:04:01,730
many cases and of course I like anybody
else might quibble about this or that in

3396
01:04:01,730 --> 01:04:01,740
else might quibble about this or that in
 

3397
01:04:01,740 --> 01:04:04,010
else might quibble about this or that in
any Wikipedia article but in general I

3398
01:04:04,010 --> 01:04:04,020
any Wikipedia article but in general I
 

3399
01:04:04,020 --> 01:04:06,530
any Wikipedia article but in general I
think there is a pretty good

3400
01:04:06,530 --> 01:04:06,540
think there is a pretty good
 

3401
01:04:06,540 --> 01:04:09,589
think there is a pretty good
um sort of willingness and indeed

3402
01:04:09,589 --> 01:04:09,599
um sort of willingness and indeed
 

3403
01:04:09,599 --> 01:04:12,530
um sort of willingness and indeed
eagerness to say oh let's let's fairly

3404
01:04:12,530 --> 01:04:12,540
eagerness to say oh let's let's fairly
 

3405
01:04:12,540 --> 01:04:14,930
eagerness to say oh let's let's fairly
represent all of the meaningfully

3406
01:04:14,930 --> 01:04:14,940
represent all of the meaningfully
 

3407
01:04:14,940 --> 01:04:17,450
represent all of the meaningfully
important sides so there's still a lot

3408
01:04:17,450 --> 01:04:17,460
important sides so there's still a lot
 

3409
01:04:17,460 --> 01:04:20,030
important sides so there's still a lot
to unpack in that right so meaningfully

3410
01:04:20,030 --> 01:04:20,040
to unpack in that right so meaningfully
 

3411
01:04:20,040 --> 01:04:25,670
to unpack in that right so meaningfully
important so you know uh people who

3412
01:04:25,670 --> 01:04:25,680
important so you know uh people who
 

3413
01:04:25,680 --> 01:04:26,990
important so you know uh people who
um

3414
01:04:26,990 --> 01:04:27,000
um
 

3415
01:04:27,000 --> 01:04:29,390
um
are raising questions about the efficacy

3416
01:04:29,390 --> 01:04:29,400
are raising questions about the efficacy
 

3417
01:04:29,400 --> 01:04:32,150
are raising questions about the efficacy
of masks okay that's actually a

3418
01:04:32,150 --> 01:04:32,160
of masks okay that's actually a
 

3419
01:04:32,160 --> 01:04:33,470
of masks okay that's actually a
reasonable thing to have a discussion

3420
01:04:33,470 --> 01:04:33,480
reasonable thing to have a discussion
 

3421
01:04:33,480 --> 01:04:35,030
reasonable thing to have a discussion
about and hopefully we should treat that

3422
01:04:35,030 --> 01:04:35,040
about and hopefully we should treat that
 

3423
01:04:35,040 --> 01:04:38,510
about and hopefully we should treat that
as a as a fair conversation to have and

3424
01:04:38,510 --> 01:04:38,520
as a as a fair conversation to have and
 

3425
01:04:38,520 --> 01:04:39,950
as a as a fair conversation to have and
actually address which authorities have

3426
01:04:39,950 --> 01:04:39,960
actually address which authorities have
 

3427
01:04:39,960 --> 01:04:42,650
actually address which authorities have
said what and so on and so forth

3428
01:04:42,650 --> 01:04:42,660
said what and so on and so forth
 

3429
01:04:42,660 --> 01:04:44,150
said what and so on and so forth
um and then you know there are other

3430
01:04:44,150 --> 01:04:44,160
um and then you know there are other
 

3431
01:04:44,160 --> 01:04:47,329
um and then you know there are other
cases where it's not meaningful

3432
01:04:47,329 --> 01:04:47,339
cases where it's not meaningful
 

3433
01:04:47,339 --> 01:04:49,069
cases where it's not meaningful

opposition you know like you just
 

3435
01:04:49,079 --> 01:04:51,289

wouldn't say if I I mean I

3436
01:04:51,289 --> 01:04:51,299
wouldn't say if I I mean I

I hope so yeah and I think so in in the
 

3509
01:06:11,579 --> 01:06:14,390
I hope so yeah and I think so in in the
main obviously you can always find uh

3510
01:06:14,390 --> 01:06:14,400
main obviously you can always find uh
 

3511
01:06:14,400 --> 01:06:16,130

there's humans involved but speaking of

there's humans involved but speaking of
 

3515
01:06:18,900 --> 01:06:22,370
there's humans involved but speaking of
those humans

3516

3517
01:06:22,380 --> 01:06:24,109

I would venture to guess I don't know

3518
01:06:24,109 --> 01:06:24,119
I would venture to guess I don't know
 

3519
01:06:24,119 --> 01:06:26,210
I would venture to guess I don't know
the data maybe you can

3520
01:06:26,210 --> 01:06:26,220
the data maybe you can
 

3521
01:06:26,220 --> 01:06:29,029
the data maybe you can
um let me know but the personal

3522
01:06:29,029 --> 01:06:29,039
um let me know but the personal
 

3523
01:06:29,039 --> 01:06:32,750
um let me know but the personal
political leaning of the group of people

3524
01:06:32,750 --> 01:06:32,760

who added Wikipedia probably leans left

3526
01:06:35,870 --> 01:06:35,880
who added Wikipedia probably leans left
 

3527
01:06:35,880 --> 01:06:37,730
who added Wikipedia probably leans left
I would guess

3528
01:06:37,730 --> 01:06:37,740
I would guess
 

3529
01:06:37,740 --> 01:06:39,770
I would guess
so to me the question there is I mean

3530
01:06:39,770 --> 01:06:39,780
so to me the question there is I mean
 

3531
01:06:39,780 --> 01:06:41,750
so to me the question there is I mean
the same is true for Silicon Valley the

3532
01:06:41,750 --> 01:06:41,760
the same is true for Silicon Valley the
 

3533
01:06:41,760 --> 01:06:43,370
the same is true for Silicon Valley the
task for Silicon Valley is to create

3534
01:06:43,370 --> 01:06:43,380
task for Silicon Valley is to create
 

3535
01:06:43,380 --> 01:06:45,170
task for Silicon Valley is to create
platforms that are not politically

3536
01:06:45,170 --> 01:06:45,180
platforms that are not politically
 

3537
01:06:45,180 --> 01:06:47,930
platforms that are not politically
biased right even though there is a bias

3538
01:06:47,930 --> 01:06:47,940
biased right even though there is a bias
 

3539
01:06:47,940 --> 01:06:50,930
biased right even though there is a bias
for the engineers who create it and I

3540
01:06:50,930 --> 01:06:50,940
for the engineers who create it and I
 

3541
01:06:50,940 --> 01:06:53,329
for the engineers who create it and I
think I believe it's possible to do that

3542
01:06:53,329 --> 01:06:53,339
think I believe it's possible to do that
 

3543
01:06:53,339 --> 01:06:55,370
think I believe it's possible to do that
I you know there's kind of conspiracy

3544
01:06:55,370 --> 01:06:55,380
I you know there's kind of conspiracy
 

3545
01:06:55,380 --> 01:06:57,170
I you know there's kind of conspiracy
theories that it somehow is impossible

3546
01:06:57,170 --> 01:06:57,180
theories that it somehow is impossible
 

3547
01:06:57,180 --> 01:06:58,849
theories that it somehow is impossible
and there's this whole conspiracy where

3548
01:06:58,849 --> 01:06:58,859
and there's this whole conspiracy where
 

3549
01:06:58,859 --> 01:07:00,890
and there's this whole conspiracy where
the left is controlling it so on I think

3550
01:07:00,890 --> 01:07:00,900
the left is controlling it so on I think
 

3551
01:07:00,900 --> 01:07:03,529
the left is controlling it so on I think
I think Engineers for the most part when

3552
01:07:03,529 --> 01:07:03,539
I think Engineers for the most part when
 

3553
01:07:03,539 --> 01:07:05,170
I think Engineers for the most part when
to create platforms that are open and

3554
01:07:05,170 --> 01:07:05,180
to create platforms that are open and
 

3555
01:07:05,180 --> 01:07:08,029
to create platforms that are open and
unbiased that are that create all kinds

3556
01:07:08,029 --> 01:07:08,039
unbiased that are that create all kinds
 

3557
01:07:08,039 --> 01:07:09,890
unbiased that are that create all kinds
of perspective because that's super

3558
01:07:09,890 --> 01:07:09,900
of perspective because that's super
 

3559
01:07:09,900 --> 01:07:11,089
of perspective because that's super
exciting to have all kinds of

3560
01:07:11,089 --> 01:07:11,099
exciting to have all kinds of
 

3561
01:07:11,099 --> 01:07:13,250
exciting to have all kinds of
perspectives battle it out but yeah

3562
01:07:13,250 --> 01:07:13,260
perspectives battle it out but yeah
 

3563
01:07:13,260 --> 01:07:17,150
perspectives battle it out but yeah
still is there is there a degree to

3564
01:07:17,150 --> 01:07:17,160
still is there is there a degree to
 

3565
01:07:17,160 --> 01:07:19,490
still is there is there a degree to
which the personal political bias of the

3566
01:07:19,490 --> 01:07:19,500
which the personal political bias of the
 

3567
01:07:19,500 --> 01:07:22,190
which the personal political bias of the
editors might seep in in Silly Ways and

3568
01:07:22,190 --> 01:07:22,200
editors might seep in in Silly Ways and
 

3569
01:07:22,200 --> 01:07:25,190
editors might seep in in Silly Ways and
in big ways Silly Ways could be uh I

3570
01:07:25,190 --> 01:07:25,200
in big ways Silly Ways could be uh I
 

3571
01:07:25,200 --> 01:07:27,049
in big ways Silly Ways could be uh I
think hopefully I'm correct in saying

3572
01:07:27,049 --> 01:07:27,059
think hopefully I'm correct in saying
 

3573
01:07:27,059 --> 01:07:29,990
think hopefully I'm correct in saying
this but the right will call

3574
01:07:29,990 --> 01:07:30,000
this but the right will call
 

3575
01:07:30,000 --> 01:07:32,450
this but the right will call
it's the Democrat Party

3576
01:07:32,450 --> 01:07:32,460
it's the Democrat Party
 

3577
01:07:32,460 --> 01:07:34,549
it's the Democrat Party
and the left will call it the Democratic

3578
01:07:34,549 --> 01:07:34,559
and the left will call it the Democratic
 

3579
01:07:34,559 --> 01:07:38,329
and the left will call it the Democratic
party right yeah like subtle it always

there's nothing in this tweet that

4596
01:26:42,950 --> 01:26:42,960
there's nothing in this tweet that
 

4597
01:26:42,960 --> 01:26:44,510
there's nothing in this tweet that
violates our terms of service we don't

4598
01:26:44,510 --> 01:26:44,520
violates our terms of service we don't
 

4599
01:26:44,520 --> 01:26:47,930
violates our terms of service we don't
regard and gave reference to the metoo

4600
01:26:47,930 --> 01:26:47,940
regard and gave reference to the metoo
 

4601
01:26:47,940 --> 01:26:49,550
regard and gave reference to the metoo
movement if we didn't allow accusations

4602
01:26:49,550 --> 01:26:49,560
movement if we didn't allow accusations
 

4603
01:26:49,560 --> 01:26:51,770
movement if we didn't allow accusations
the metoo movement it's an important

4604
01:26:51,770 --> 01:26:51,780
the metoo movement it's an important
 

4605
01:26:51,780 --> 01:26:53,689
the metoo movement it's an important
thing and I was like you know what

4606
01:26:53,689 --> 01:26:53,699
thing and I was like you know what
 

4607
01:26:53,699 --> 01:26:56,450
thing and I was like you know what
actually if someone says I'm 10 years

4608
01:26:56,450 --> 01:26:56,460
actually if someone says I'm 10 years
 

4609
01:26:56,460 --> 01:26:58,189
actually if someone says I'm 10 years
old and someone raped me last week I

4610
01:26:58,189 --> 01:26:58,199
old and someone raped me last week I
 

4611
01:26:58,199 --> 01:26:59,990
old and someone raped me last week I
think the advice should be here's the

4612
01:26:59,990 --> 01:27:00,000
think the advice should be here's the
 

4613
01:27:00,000 --> 01:27:01,729
think the advice should be here's the
phone number of the police like you need

4614
01:27:01,729 --> 01:27:01,739
phone number of the police like you need
 

4615
01:27:01,739 --> 01:27:03,470
phone number of the police like you need
to get the police involved it's not the

4616
01:27:03,470 --> 01:27:03,480
to get the police involved it's not the
 

4617
01:27:03,480 --> 01:27:05,030
to get the police involved it's not the
place for that accusation

4618
01:27:05,030 --> 01:27:05,040
place for that accusation
 

4619
01:27:05,040 --> 01:27:07,610
place for that accusation
so even back then by the way they did

4620
01:27:07,610 --> 01:27:07,620
so even back then by the way they did
 

4621
01:27:07,620 --> 01:27:09,290
so even back then by the way they did
delete those tweets but I mean the

4622
01:27:09,290 --> 01:27:09,300
delete those tweets but I mean the
 

4623
01:27:09,300 --> 01:27:11,270
delete those tweets but I mean the
rationale they gave us a spammy behavior

4624
01:27:11,270 --> 01:27:11,280
rationale they gave us a spammy behavior
 

4625
01:27:11,280 --> 01:27:13,010
rationale they gave us a spammy behavior
right so completely separate from

4626
01:27:13,010 --> 01:27:13,020
right so completely separate from
 

4627
01:27:13,020 --> 01:27:14,930
right so completely separate from
abusing me it was just like oh well they

4628
01:27:14,930 --> 01:27:14,940
abusing me it was just like oh well they
 

4629
01:27:14,940 --> 01:27:17,050
abusing me it was just like oh well they
were retweeting too often okay whatever

4630
01:27:17,050 --> 01:27:17,060
were retweeting too often okay whatever
 

4631
01:27:17,060 --> 01:27:20,149
were retweeting too often okay whatever
so like that's just broken like that's a

4632
01:27:20,149 --> 01:27:20,159
so like that's just broken like that's a
 

4633
01:27:20,159 --> 01:27:22,669
so like that's just broken like that's a
system that it's not working for people

4634
01:27:22,669 --> 01:27:22,679
system that it's not working for people
 

4635
01:27:22,679 --> 01:27:24,229
system that it's not working for people
in the public eye I'm sure it's not

4636
01:27:24,229 --> 01:27:24,239
in the public eye I'm sure it's not
 

4637
01:27:24,239 --> 01:27:26,270
in the public eye I'm sure it's not
working for private people who get abuse

4638
01:27:26,270 --> 01:27:26,280
working for private people who get abuse
 

4639
01:27:26,280 --> 01:27:29,510
working for private people who get abuse
really horrible abuse can happen

4640
01:27:29,510 --> 01:27:29,520
really horrible abuse can happen
 

4641
01:27:29,520 --> 01:27:31,910
really horrible abuse can happen
so how is that today well it hasn't

4642
01:27:31,910 --> 01:27:31,920
so how is that today well it hasn't
 

4643
01:27:31,920 --> 01:27:33,169
so how is that today well it hasn't
happened to me

4644
01:27:33,169 --> 01:27:33,179
happened to me
 

4645
01:27:33,179 --> 01:27:34,970
happened to me
um since Elon took over but I don't see

4646
01:27:34,970 --> 01:27:34,980
um since Elon took over but I don't see
 

4647
01:27:34,980 --> 01:27:37,370
um since Elon took over but I don't see
why it couldn't and I suspect now if I

4648
01:27:37,370 --> 01:27:37,380
why it couldn't and I suspect now if I
 

4649
01:27:37,380 --> 01:27:38,870
why it couldn't and I suspect now if I
send a report and email someone there's

4650
01:27:38,870 --> 01:27:38,880
send a report and email someone there's
 

4651
01:27:38,880 --> 01:27:40,970
send a report and email someone there's
no one there to email me back because

4652
01:27:40,970 --> 01:27:40,980
no one there to email me back because
 

4653
01:27:40,980 --> 01:27:42,770
no one there to email me back because
he's gotten rid of a lot of the trust

4654
01:27:42,770 --> 01:27:42,780
he's gotten rid of a lot of the trust
 

4655
01:27:42,780 --> 01:27:44,930
he's gotten rid of a lot of the trust
and safety staff so I suspect that

4656
01:27:44,930 --> 01:27:44,940
and safety staff so I suspect that
 

4657
01:27:44,940 --> 01:27:47,209
and safety staff so I suspect that
problem is still really hard just

4658
01:27:47,209 --> 01:27:47,219
problem is still really hard just
 

4659
01:27:47,219 --> 01:27:50,330
problem is still really hard just

don't know the full answer to this I
 

4665
01:27:54,719 --> 01:27:58,129
don't know the full answer to this I
mean a piece of it could be

4666
01:27:58,129 --> 01:27:58,139
mean a piece of it could be
 

4667
01:27:58,139 --> 01:28:00,350
mean a piece of it could be
um you know to say actually making

4668
01:28:00,350 --> 01:28:00,360
um you know to say actually making
 

4669
01:28:00,360 --> 01:28:04,189
um you know to say actually making
specific allegations of crimes uh this

4670

specific allegations of crimes uh this
 

4671
01:28:04,199 --> 01:28:06,169
specific allegations of crimes uh this
isn't the place to do that you know

4672
01:28:06,169 --> 01:28:06,179
isn't the place to do that you know
 

4673
01:28:06,179 --> 01:28:07,970
isn't the place to do that you know
we've got a huge database if you've got

4674
01:28:07,970 --> 01:28:07,980
we've got a huge database if you've got
 

4675
01:28:07,980 --> 01:28:10,550
we've got a huge database if you've got
an accusation of crime here's who's your

4676
01:28:10,550 --> 01:28:10,560
an accusation of crime here's who's your

4679
01:28:13,080 --> 01:28:15,649
call the police the FBI whatever it is
it's not to be done in public and then

4680
01:28:15,649 --> 01:28:15,659
it's not to be done in public and then
 

4681
01:28:15,659 --> 01:28:17,510
it's not to be done in public and then
you do face really complicated questions

4682
01:28:17,510 --> 01:28:17,520
you do face really complicated questions
 

4683
01:28:17,520 --> 01:28:19,790
you do face really complicated questions
about metoo movement and people coming

4684
01:28:19,790 --> 01:28:19,800
about metoo movement and people coming
 

4685
01:28:19,800 --> 01:28:21,649
about metoo movement and people coming
forward in public and all of that but

01:28:21,649 --> 01:28:21,659
forward in public and all of that but
 

4687
01:28:21,659 --> 01:28:23,689
forward in public and all of that but
it's again it's like probably you should

4688
01:28:23,689 --> 01:28:23,699
it's again it's like probably you should
 

4689
01:28:23,699 --> 01:28:25,310
it's again it's like probably you should
talk to a journalist right probably

4690
01:28:25,310 --> 01:28:25,320
talk to a journalist right probably
 

4691
01:28:25,320 --> 01:28:27,350
talk to a journalist right probably
there are better Avenues than just

4692
01:28:27,350 --> 01:28:27,360
there are better Avenues than just

01:34:00,470 --> 01:34:00,480
and cons do you think it's scalable I do
 

5003
01:34:00,480 --> 01:34:02,090
and cons do you think it's scalable I do
like it I don't know enough about

5004
01:34:02,090 --> 01:34:02,100
like it I don't know enough about
 

5005
01:34:02,100 --> 01:34:04,370
like it I don't know enough about
specifically how it's implemented to

5006
01:34:04,370 --> 01:34:04,380
specifically how it's implemented to
 

5007
01:34:04,380 --> 01:34:07,430
specifically how it's implemented to
really have a very deep view but I do

5008
01:34:07,430 --> 01:34:07,440
really have a very deep view but I do
 

5009
01:34:07,440 --> 01:34:10,129
really have a very deep view but I do
think it's quite it's the uses I've seen

5010
01:34:10,129 --> 01:34:10,139
think it's quite it's the uses I've seen
 

5011
01:34:10,139 --> 01:34:12,169
think it's quite it's the uses I've seen
of it I've I've found quite good and in

5012
01:34:12,169 --> 01:34:12,179
of it I've I've found quite good and in
 

5013
01:34:12,179 --> 01:34:14,629
of it I've I've found quite good and in
some cases uh

5014
01:34:14,629 --> 01:34:14,639
some cases uh
 

5015
01:34:14,639 --> 01:34:17,750
some cases uh
changed my mind uh you know it's like I

5016
01:34:17,750 --> 01:34:17,760
changed my mind uh you know it's like I
 

5017
01:34:17,760 --> 01:34:19,850
changed my mind uh you know it's like I
see something and of course you know the

5018
01:34:19,850 --> 01:34:19,860
see something and of course you know the
 

5019
01:34:19,860 --> 01:34:22,310
see something and of course you know the
the sort of human tendency is

5020
01:34:22,310 --> 01:34:22,320
the sort of human tendency is
 

5021
01:34:22,320 --> 01:34:25,610
the sort of human tendency is
uh to retweet something

5022
01:34:25,610 --> 01:34:25,620
uh to retweet something
 

5023
01:34:25,620 --> 01:34:27,470
uh to retweet something
that you

5024
01:34:27,470 --> 01:34:27,480
that you
 

5025
01:34:27,480 --> 01:34:29,570
that you
hope is true or that you are afraid is

5026
01:34:29,570 --> 01:34:29,580
hope is true or that you are afraid is
 

5027
01:34:29,580 --> 01:34:31,750
hope is true or that you are afraid is
true or you know it's like that kind of

5028
01:34:31,750 --> 01:34:31,760
true or you know it's like that kind of
 

5029
01:34:31,760 --> 01:34:34,610
true or you know it's like that kind of
quick mental action

5030
01:34:34,610 --> 01:34:34,620
quick mental action
 

5031
01:34:34,620 --> 01:34:36,590
quick mental action
and then you know I saw something that I

5032
01:34:36,590 --> 01:34:36,600
and then you know I saw something that I
 

5033
01:34:36,600 --> 01:34:37,970
and then you know I saw something that I
liked and agreed with and then a

5034
01:34:37,970 --> 01:34:37,980
liked and agreed with and then a
 

5035
01:34:37,980 --> 01:34:39,649
liked and agreed with and then a
community note under it that made me

5036
01:34:39,649 --> 01:34:39,659
community note under it that made me
 

5037
01:34:39,659 --> 01:34:40,910
community note under it that made me
think oh actually

5038
01:34:40,910 --> 01:34:40,920
think oh actually
 

5039
01:34:40,920 --> 01:34:43,430
think oh actually
this is a more nuanced issue so I like

5040
01:34:43,430 --> 01:34:43,440
this is a more nuanced issue so I like
 

5041
01:34:43,440 --> 01:34:44,270
this is a more nuanced issue so I like
that

5042
01:34:44,270 --> 01:34:44,280
that
 

5043
01:34:44,280 --> 01:34:46,370
that
um I think that's really important now

5044
01:34:46,370 --> 01:34:46,380
um I think that's really important now
 

5045
01:34:46,380 --> 01:34:47,990
um I think that's really important now
how is it specifically implemented is it

5046
01:34:47,990 --> 01:34:48,000
how is it specifically implemented is it
 

5047
01:34:48,000 --> 01:34:49,310
how is it specifically implemented is it
scalable that I don't really know how

5048
01:34:49,310 --> 01:34:49,320
scalable that I don't really know how
 

5049
01:34:49,320 --> 01:34:51,110
scalable that I don't really know how
they've done it so I can't really

5050
01:34:51,110 --> 01:34:51,120
they've done it so I can't really
 

5051
01:34:51,120 --> 01:34:53,629
they've done it so I can't really
comment on that but in general I do

5052
01:34:53,629 --> 01:34:53,639
comment on that but in general I do
 

5053
01:34:53,639 --> 01:34:54,770
comment on that but in general I do
think it's

5054
01:34:54,770 --> 01:34:54,780
think it's
 

5055
01:34:54,780 --> 01:34:57,310
think it's
um you know when you're when you're only

5056
01:34:57,310 --> 01:34:57,320
um you know when you're when you're only

um you know when you're when you're only

blocking
 

5071
01:35:12,380 --> 01:35:16,070
blocking
it's a pretty limited scope and it's

5072
01:35:16,070 --> 01:35:16,080
it's a pretty limited scope and it's
 

5073
01:35:16,080 --> 01:35:18,050
it's a pretty limited scope and it's
kind of good if there's a way to elevate

01:35:18,050 --> 01:35:18,060
kind of good if there's a way to elevate

a specific thoughtful response and it
kind of goes to again like does the

5078
01:35:23,450 --> 01:35:23,460
kind of goes to again like does the
 

5079
01:35:23,460 --> 01:35:27,229
kind of goes to again like does the
algorithm just pick the retweet or the I

5080
01:35:27,229 --> 01:35:27,239
algorithm just pick the retweet or the I
 

5081
01:35:27,239 --> 01:35:28,610
algorithm just pick the retweet or the I
mean retweeting it's not even the

5082
01:35:28,610 --> 01:35:28,620
mean retweeting it's not even the
 

5083
01:35:28,620 --> 01:35:31,430
mean retweeting it's not even the
algorithm that makes it viral like you

5084
01:35:31,430 --> 01:35:31,440
algorithm that makes it viral like you
 

5085
01:35:31,440 --> 01:35:34,729
algorithm that makes it viral like you
know if uh Palo cuello

5086
01:35:34,729 --> 01:35:34,739

um very famous author I think it's got
 

5089
01:35:36,360 --> 01:35:37,490
um very famous author I think it's got
like I don't know I haven't looked

5090
01:35:37,490 --> 01:35:37,500
like I don't know I haven't looked
 

5091
01:35:37,500 --> 01:35:38,629
like I don't know I haven't looked
lately he used to have eight million

5092
01:35:38,629 --> 01:35:38,639
lately he used to have eight million
 

5093
01:35:38,639 --> 01:35:39,770
lately he used to have eight million
Twitter followers I think I looked he's

5094
01:35:39,770 --> 01:35:39,780
Twitter followers I think I looked he's
 

5095
01:35:39,780 --> 01:35:41,870
Twitter followers I think I looked he's
got 16 million now or whatever well if

5096
01:35:41,870 --> 01:35:41,880
got 16 million now or whatever well if
 

5097
01:35:41,880 --> 01:35:43,129
got 16 million now or whatever well if
he retweets something it's going to get

5098
01:35:43,129 --> 01:35:43,139
he retweets something it's going to get
 

5099
01:35:43,139 --> 01:35:46,010
he retweets something it's going to get
seen a lot or Elon Musk if you retweets

5100
01:35:46,010 --> 01:35:46,020
seen a lot or Elon Musk if you retweets
 

5101
01:35:46,020 --> 01:35:47,030
seen a lot or Elon Musk if you retweets
something it's going to get seen a lot

5102
01:35:47,030 --> 01:35:47,040
something it's going to get seen a lot
 

5103
01:35:47,040 --> 01:35:48,890
something it's going to get seen a lot
that's not an algorithm that's just the

5104
01:35:48,890 --> 01:35:48,900
that's not an algorithm that's just the
 

5105
01:35:48,900 --> 01:35:51,290
that's not an algorithm that's just the
way the platform works so it is kind of

5106
01:35:51,290 --> 01:35:51,300
way the platform works so it is kind of
 

5107
01:35:51,300 --> 01:35:54,350
way the platform works so it is kind of
nice if you have something else and how

5108
01:35:54,350 --> 01:35:54,360
nice if you have something else and how
 

5109
01:35:54,360 --> 01:35:55,610
nice if you have something else and how
that something else is designed that's

5110
01:35:55,610 --> 01:35:55,620
that something else is designed that's
 

5111
01:35:55,620 --> 01:35:56,810
that something else is designed that's
obviously

5112
01:35:56,810 --> 01:35:56,820
obviously
 

5113
01:35:56,820 --> 01:35:59,090
obviously
complicated question well there's a this

5114
01:35:59,090 --> 01:35:59,100
complicated question well there's a this
 

5115
01:35:59,100 --> 01:36:01,010
complicated question well there's a this
interesting thing that I think Twitter

5116
01:36:01,010 --> 01:36:01,020
interesting thing that I think Twitter
 

5117
01:36:01,020 --> 01:36:02,510
interesting thing that I think Twitter
is doing but I know Facebook is doing

5118
01:36:02,510 --> 01:36:02,520
is doing but I know Facebook is doing
 

5119
01:36:02,520 --> 01:36:04,910
is doing but I know Facebook is doing
for sure which is

5120
01:36:04,910 --> 01:36:04,920
for sure which is
 

5121
01:36:04,920 --> 01:36:08,149
for sure which is
really interesting so you have what are

5122
01:36:08,149 --> 01:36:08,159
really interesting so you have what are
 

5123
01:36:08,159 --> 01:36:09,709
really interesting so you have what are
the signals that a human can provide at

5124
01:36:09,709 --> 01:36:09,719
the signals that a human can provide at
 

5125
01:36:09,719 --> 01:36:14,330
the signals that a human can provide at
scale like in Twitter's retweet

5126
01:36:14,330 --> 01:36:14,340
scale like in Twitter's retweet
 

5127
01:36:14,340 --> 01:36:16,550
scale like in Twitter's retweet
um in Facebook I think you can share I

5128
01:36:16,550 --> 01:36:16,560
um in Facebook I think you can share I
 

5129
01:36:16,560 --> 01:36:17,510
um in Facebook I think you can share I
think yeah but there's basic

5130
01:36:17,510 --> 01:36:17,520
think yeah but there's basic
 

5131
01:36:17,520 --> 01:36:19,250
think yeah but there's basic
interactions you can have comment and so

5132
01:36:19,250 --> 01:36:19,260
interactions you can have comment and so
 

5133
01:36:19,260 --> 01:36:22,010
interactions you can have comment and so
on yeah but there's also in Facebook and

5134
01:36:22,010 --> 01:36:22,020
on yeah but there's also in Facebook and
 

5135
01:36:22,020 --> 01:36:24,530
on yeah but there's also in Facebook and
YouTube has this too is um

5136
01:36:24,530 --> 01:36:24,540
YouTube has this too is um
 

5137
01:36:24,540 --> 01:36:26,629
YouTube has this too is um
would you like to see more of this or

5138
01:36:26,629 --> 01:36:26,639
would you like to see more of this or
 

5139
01:36:26,639 --> 01:36:29,149
would you like to see more of this or
would you like to see less of this they

5140
01:36:29,149 --> 01:36:29,159
would you like to see less of this they
 

5141
01:36:29,159 --> 01:36:31,669
would you like to see less of this they
post that sometimes and the thing that

5142
01:36:31,669 --> 01:36:31,679
post that sometimes and the thing that
 

5143
01:36:31,679 --> 01:36:34,129
post that sometimes and the thing that
the the neural net that's learning from

5144
01:36:34,129 --> 01:36:34,139
the the neural net that's learning from
 

5145
01:36:34,139 --> 01:36:36,189
the the neural net that's learning from
that has to figure out is the intent

5146
01:36:36,189 --> 01:36:36,199
that has to figure out is the intent
 

5147
01:36:36,199 --> 01:36:38,570
that has to figure out is the intent
behind you saying I want to see less of

5148
01:36:38,570 --> 01:36:38,580
behind you saying I want to see less of
 

5149
01:36:38,580 --> 01:36:40,430
behind you saying I want to see less of
this did you see too much of this

5150
01:36:40,430 --> 01:36:40,440
this did you see too much of this
 

5151
01:36:40,440 --> 01:36:43,370
this did you see too much of this
content already uh you like it but you

5152
01:36:43,370 --> 01:36:43,380
content already uh you like it but you
 

5153
01:36:43,380 --> 01:36:45,530
content already uh you like it but you
don't want to see so much of it uh

5154
01:36:45,530 --> 01:36:45,540
don't want to see so much of it uh
 

5155
01:36:45,540 --> 01:36:47,390
don't want to see so much of it uh
you've already figured it out good great

5156

proud of the entry at the end of the day
 

5439
01:41:52,199 --> 01:41:54,590
proud of the entry at the end of the day
not because they suppress the other

5440
01:41:54,590 --> 01:41:54,600
not because they suppress the other
 

5441
01:41:54,600 --> 01:41:57,050
not because they suppress the other
side's views but because they think the

5442
01:41:57,050 --> 01:41:57,060
side's views but because they think the
 

5443
01:41:57,060 --> 01:41:58,370
side's views but because they think the
case has been stated very well that

5444
01:41:58,370 --> 01:41:58,380
case has been stated very well that
 

5445
01:41:58,380 --> 01:41:59,930
case has been stated very well that
other people can come to understand it

5446
01:41:59,930 --> 01:41:59,940
other people can come to understand it
 

5447
01:41:59,940 --> 01:42:02,209
other people can come to understand it
and if you're highly ideological you

5448
01:42:02,209 --> 01:42:02,219
and if you're highly ideological you
 

5449
01:42:02,219 --> 01:42:04,550
and if you're highly ideological you
assume I think naturally if people

5450
01:42:04,550 --> 01:42:04,560
assume I think naturally if people
 

5451
01:42:04,560 --> 01:42:06,290
assume I think naturally if people
understood as much about this as I do

5452
01:42:06,290 --> 01:42:06,300
understood as much about this as I do
 

5453
01:42:06,300 --> 01:42:07,970
understood as much about this as I do
they'll probably agree with me you may

5454
01:42:07,970 --> 01:42:07,980
they'll probably agree with me you may
 

5455
01:42:07,980 --> 01:42:10,250
they'll probably agree with me you may
be wrong about that but that's often the

5456
01:42:10,250 --> 01:42:10,260
be wrong about that but that's often the
 

5457
01:42:10,260 --> 01:42:12,470
be wrong about that but that's often the
case so so that's where you know that's

5458
01:42:12,470 --> 01:42:12,480
case so so that's where you know that's
 

5459
01:42:12,480 --> 01:42:14,330
case so so that's where you know that's
what I think we need to encourage more

5460
01:42:14,330 --> 01:42:14,340
what I think we need to encourage more

and implemented all that kind of stuff

5490
01:42:55,250 --> 01:42:55,260
and implemented all that kind of stuff
 

5491
01:42:55,260 --> 01:42:57,590
and implemented all that kind of stuff
yeah I think so

5492
01:42:57,590 --> 01:42:57,600
yeah I think so
 

5493
01:42:57,600 --> 01:42:59,330
yeah I think so
um and I think if you read the article

5494
01:42:59,330 --> 01:42:59,340
um and I think if you read the article
 

5495
01:42:59,340 --> 01:43:01,250
um and I think if you read the article
it's pretty good

5496
01:43:01,250 --> 01:43:01,260
it's pretty good
 

5497
01:43:01,260 --> 01:43:04,790
it's pretty good
um and I think a piece of that is within

5498
01:43:04,790 --> 01:43:04,800
um and I think a piece of that is within
 

5499
01:43:04,800 --> 01:43:06,129
um and I think a piece of that is within
our community

5500
01:43:06,129 --> 01:43:06,139
our community
 

5501
01:43:06,139 --> 01:43:10,430
our community
uh if people have the the self-awareness

uh if people have the the self-awareness
 

5503
01:43:10,440 --> 01:43:13,310
uh if people have the the self-awareness
to understand so I personally

5504
01:43:13,310 --> 01:43:13,320

to do it I would fail I wouldn't be a
 

5513
01:43:22,619 --> 01:43:24,709
to do it I would fail I wouldn't be a
good wikipedian so it's better if I just

5514
01:43:24,709 --> 01:43:24,719
good wikipedian so it's better if I just
 

5515
01:43:24,719 --> 01:43:26,530
good wikipedian so it's better if I just
step back and let people who are more

5516
01:43:26,530 --> 01:43:26,540
step back and let people who are more
 

5517
01:43:26,540 --> 01:43:29,330
step back and let people who are more
dispassionate on this topic edit it

5518

dispassionate on this topic edit it
 

5519

5531
01:43:43,380 --> 01:43:44,750
efficacy of masks I'm like oh I think
that's an interesting problem and I

5532
01:43:44,750 --> 01:43:44,760
that's an interesting problem and I
 

5533
01:43:44,760 --> 01:43:46,669
that's an interesting problem and I
don't know the answer but I can help

5534
01:43:46,669 --> 01:43:46,679
don't know the answer but I can help
 

5535
01:43:46,679 --> 01:43:48,350
don't know the answer but I can help
kind of catalog what's the best evidence

5536
01:43:48,350 --> 01:43:48,360
kind of catalog what's the best evidence
 

5537
01:43:48,360 --> 01:43:50,930
kind of catalog what's the best evidence
and so on I'm not going to get upset I'm

5538
01:43:50,930 --> 01:43:50,940
and so on I'm not going to get upset I'm
 

5539
01:43:50,940 --> 01:43:53,149
and so on I'm not going to get upset I'm
not going to get angry I'm able to be a

5540
01:43:53,149 --> 01:43:53,159
not going to get angry I'm able to be a
 

5541
01:43:53,159 --> 01:43:55,010
not going to get angry I'm able to be a
good wikipedian so I think that's

5542
01:43:55,010 --> 01:43:55,020
good wikipedian so I think that's
 

5543
01:43:55,020 --> 01:43:59,510
good wikipedian so I think that's
important and I do think though in in a

5544
01:43:59,510 --> 01:43:59,520
important and I do think though in in a
 

5545
01:43:59,520 --> 01:44:03,850
important and I do think though in in a
uh related framework that the

5546
01:44:03,850 --> 01:44:03,860
uh related framework that the
 

5547
01:44:03,860 --> 01:44:06,229
uh related framework that the
composition of the community is really

5548
01:44:06,229 --> 01:44:06,239
composition of the community is really
 

5549
01:44:06,239 --> 01:44:09,530
composition of the community is really
important uh not because Wikipedia is or

5550
01:44:09,530 --> 01:44:09,540
important uh not because Wikipedia is or
 

5551
01:44:09,540 --> 01:44:11,689
important uh not because Wikipedia is or
should be a Battleground but because

5552
01:44:11,689 --> 01:44:11,699
should be a Battleground but because
 

5553
01:44:11,699 --> 01:44:14,149
should be a Battleground but because
blind spots like maybe I don't even

5554
01:44:14,149 --> 01:44:14,159
blind spots like maybe I don't even
 

5555
01:44:14,159 --> 01:44:16,550
blind spots like maybe I don't even
realize what's biased if I'm if I'm

5556
01:44:16,550 --> 01:44:16,560

5560
01:44:20,330 --> 01:44:20,340
and I've never thought much about it so
 

5561
01:44:20,340 --> 01:44:22,430
and I've never thought much about it so
one of the things we we focus on a lot

5562
01:44:22,430 --> 01:44:22,440
one of the things we we focus on a lot

01:54:03,290 --> 01:54:03,300
it's like this guy and a group a
 

6087
01:54:03,300 --> 01:54:05,209
it's like this guy and a group a
community around him and basically

6088
01:54:05,209 --> 01:54:05,219
community around him and basically
 

6089
01:54:05,219 --> 01:54:07,550
community around him and basically
something something weird happened

6090
01:54:07,550 --> 01:54:07,560
something something weird happened
 

6091
01:54:07,560 --> 01:54:10,189
something something weird happened
and it broke something because he was on

6092
01:54:10,189 --> 01:54:10,199
and it broke something because he was on
 

6093
01:54:10,199 --> 01:54:12,530
and it broke something because he was on
vacation and I'm just like isn't that

6094
01:54:12,530 --> 01:54:12,540
vacation and I'm just like isn't that
 

6095
01:54:12,540 --> 01:54:14,990
vacation and I'm just like isn't that
wild right that you would think I mean

6096
01:54:14,990 --> 01:54:15,000
wild right that you would think I mean
 

6097
01:54:15,000 --> 01:54:16,189
wild right that you would think I mean
first of all most people never even

6098
01:54:16,189 --> 01:54:16,199
first of all most people never even
 

6099
01:54:16,199 --> 01:54:17,570
first of all most people never even
think about like how do computers know

6100
01:54:17,570 --> 01:54:17,580
think about like how do computers know
 

6101
01:54:17,580 --> 01:54:19,970
think about like how do computers know
about time zones

6102
01:54:19,970 --> 01:54:19,980
about time zones
 

6103
01:54:19,980 --> 01:54:21,709
about time zones
um well they know because they just use

6104
01:54:21,709 --> 01:54:21,719
um well they know because they just use
 

6105
01:54:21,719 --> 01:54:23,330
um well they know because they just use
this file which tells all the time zones

6106
01:54:23,330 --> 01:54:23,340
this file which tells all the time zones
 

6107
01:54:23,340 --> 01:54:25,189
this file which tells all the time zones
and and which dates they change and all

6108
01:54:25,189 --> 01:54:25,199
and and which dates they change and all
 

6109
01:54:25,199 --> 01:54:27,290
and and which dates they change and all
of that but there's this one guy and he

6110
01:54:27,290 --> 01:54:27,300
of that but there's this one guy and he
 

6111
01:54:27,300 --> 01:54:29,030
of that but there's this one guy and he
doesn't get paid for it it's just he's

6112
01:54:29,030 --> 01:54:29,040
doesn't get paid for it it's just he's
 

6113
01:54:29,040 --> 01:54:31,669
doesn't get paid for it it's just he's
like you know with all the billions of

6114
01:54:31,669 --> 01:54:31,679
like you know with all the billions of
 

6115
01:54:31,679 --> 01:54:32,990
like you know with all the billions of
people on the planet he sort of put his

6116
01:54:32,990 --> 01:54:33,000
people on the planet he sort of put his
 

6117
01:54:33,000 --> 01:54:34,729
people on the planet he sort of put his
hand up and goes yo I'll take care of

6118
01:54:34,729 --> 01:54:34,739
hand up and goes yo I'll take care of
 

6119
01:54:34,739 --> 01:54:36,830
hand up and goes yo I'll take care of
the time zones you know and there's a

6120
01:54:36,830 --> 01:54:36,840
the time zones you know and there's a
 

6121
01:54:36,840 --> 01:54:39,410
the time zones you know and there's a
lot a lot a lot of programmers listening

6122
01:54:39,410 --> 01:54:39,420
lot a lot a lot of programmers listening
 

6123
01:54:39,420 --> 01:54:42,290
lot a lot a lot of programmers listening
to this right now with PTSD about time

6124
01:54:42,290 --> 01:54:42,300
to this right now with PTSD about time
 

6125
01:54:42,300 --> 01:54:45,590
to this right now with PTSD about time
zones and then there uh I mean there's

6126
01:54:45,590 --> 01:54:45,600
zones and then there uh I mean there's
 

6127
01:54:45,600 --> 01:54:47,330
zones and then there uh I mean there's
on top of this one guy there's other

6128
01:54:47,330 --> 01:54:47,340
on top of this one guy there's other
 

6129
01:54:47,340 --> 01:54:49,490
on top of this one guy there's other
libraries the different programming

6130
01:54:49,490 --> 01:54:49,500
libraries the different programming
 

6131
01:54:49,500 --> 01:54:50,930
libraries the different programming
languages that help manage the time

6132
01:54:50,930 --> 01:54:50,940
languages that help manage the time
 

6133
01:54:50,940 --> 01:54:53,209
languages that help manage the time
zones for you but still there's just

6134
01:54:53,209 --> 01:54:53,219
zones for you but still there's just
 

6135
01:54:53,219 --> 01:54:56,689
zones for you but still there's just
within those there's it's amazing just

6136
01:54:56,689 --> 01:54:56,699
within those there's it's amazing just
 

6137
01:54:56,699 --> 01:54:58,850
within those there's it's amazing just
the packages the libraries how few

6138
01:54:58,850 --> 01:54:58,860
the packages the libraries how few
 

6139
01:54:58,860 --> 01:55:01,010
the packages the libraries how few
people build oh yeah out of their own

6140
01:55:01,010 --> 01:55:01,020
people build oh yeah out of their own
 

6141

community and all of that yeah it's uh I

6144
01:55:06,770 --> 01:55:06,780
community and all of that yeah it's uh I
 

6145
01:55:06,780 --> 01:55:08,450

when you spot them in the wild you just

6150
01:55:12,410 --> 01:55:12,420
when you spot them in the wild you just
 

6151
01:55:12,420 --> 01:55:14,270
when you spot them in the wild you just
want to be like yeah well careful yeah

that thing no I treasured I met a guy
many years ago

6156
01:55:19,189 --> 01:55:19,199
many years ago
 

6157
01:55:19,199 --> 01:55:21,770
many years ago
um lovely really sweet guy and he's

um lovely really sweet guy and he's
 

6159
01:55:21,780 --> 01:55:25,790
um lovely really sweet guy and he's
running a bot on English Wikipedia that

6160
01:55:25,790 --> 01:55:25,800
running a bot on English Wikipedia that
 

6161
01:55:25,800 --> 01:55:27,350
running a bot on English Wikipedia that
I thought wow that's actually super

6162
01:55:27,350 --> 01:55:27,360
I thought wow that's actually super
 

6163
01:55:27,360 --> 01:55:29,030
I thought wow that's actually super
clever and what he had done is

6164
01:55:29,030 --> 01:55:29,040
clever and what he had done is
 

6165
01:55:29,040 --> 01:55:31,550
clever and what he had done is
his butt was like spell checking but

6166
01:55:31,550 --> 01:55:31,560
his butt was like spell checking but
 

6167
01:55:31,560 --> 01:55:33,590
his butt was like spell checking but
rather than simple spell checking what

6168
01:55:33,590 --> 01:55:33,600
rather than simple spell checking what
 

6169
01:55:33,600 --> 01:55:36,109
rather than simple spell checking what
he had done is create a database of

6170
01:55:36,109 --> 01:55:36,119
he had done is create a database of
 

6171
01:55:36,119 --> 01:55:38,270
he had done is create a database of
words that are commonly mistaken for

6172
01:55:38,270 --> 01:55:38,280
words that are commonly mistaken for
 

6173
01:55:38,280 --> 01:55:41,270
words that are commonly mistaken for
other words they're spelled wrong so I

6174
01:55:41,270 --> 01:55:41,280
other words they're spelled wrong so I
 

6175
01:55:41,280 --> 01:55:42,890
other words they're spelled wrong so I
can't even give an example

6176
01:55:42,890 --> 01:55:42,900
can't even give an example
 

6177
01:55:42,900 --> 01:55:46,550
can't even give an example
and so the word is people often spell it

6178
01:55:46,550 --> 01:55:46,560
and so the word is people often spell it
 

6179
01:55:46,560 --> 01:55:49,310
and so the word is people often spell it
wrong but no spell checker catches it

6180
01:55:49,310 --> 01:55:49,320
wrong but no spell checker catches it
 

6181
01:55:49,320 --> 01:55:52,010
wrong but no spell checker catches it
because it is another word

6182
01:55:52,010 --> 01:55:52,020
because it is another word
 

6183
01:55:52,020 --> 01:55:54,890
because it is another word
and so what he did is he wrote a bot

6184
01:55:54,890 --> 01:55:54,900
and so what he did is he wrote a bot
 

6185
01:55:54,900 --> 01:55:57,530
and so what he did is he wrote a bot
that looks for these words and then

6186
01:55:57,530 --> 01:55:57,540
that looks for these words and then
 

6187
01:55:57,540 --> 01:55:59,270
that looks for these words and then
checks the sentence around it for

6188
01:55:59,270 --> 01:55:59,280
checks the sentence around it for
 

6189
01:55:59,280 --> 01:56:02,330
checks the sentence around it for
certain keywords so in in some context

6190
01:56:02,330 --> 01:56:02,340
certain keywords so in in some context
 

6191
01:56:02,340 --> 01:56:03,590
certain keywords so in in some context
uh

6192
01:56:03,590 --> 01:56:03,600
uh
 

6193
01:56:03,600 --> 01:56:06,970
uh
this isn't correct but buoy and boy

6194
01:56:06,970 --> 01:56:06,980
this isn't correct but buoy and boy
 

6195
01:56:06,980 --> 01:56:10,669
this isn't correct but buoy and boy
people sometimes type Boi when they mean

6196
01:56:10,669 --> 01:56:10,679
people sometimes type Boi when they mean
 

6197
01:56:10,679 --> 01:56:13,550
people sometimes type Boi when they mean
b-o-u-y so if he sees the word boy be a

6198
01:56:13,550 --> 01:56:13,560
b-o-u-y so if he sees the word boy be a
 

6199
01:56:13,560 --> 01:56:15,290
b-o-u-y so if he sees the word boy be a
y in an article he would look in the

6200
01:56:15,290 --> 01:56:15,300
y in an article he would look in the
 

6201
01:56:15,300 --> 01:56:16,850
y in an article he would look in the
context and see is this a nautical

6202
01:56:16,850 --> 01:56:16,860
context and see is this a nautical
 

6203
01:56:16,860 --> 01:56:19,550
context and see is this a nautical
reference and if it was he didn't auto

6204
01:56:19,550 --> 01:56:19,560
reference and if it was he didn't auto
 

6205
01:56:19,560 --> 01:56:21,290
reference and if it was he didn't auto
correct he just would flag it up to

6206
01:56:21,290 --> 01:56:21,300
correct he just would flag it up to
 

6207
01:56:21,300 --> 01:56:23,390
correct he just would flag it up to
himself to go oh check this one out and

6208
01:56:23,390 --> 01:56:23,400
himself to go oh check this one out and
 

6209
01:56:23,400 --> 01:56:24,890
himself to go oh check this one out and
that's not a great example but he had

6210
01:56:24,890 --> 01:56:24,900
that's not a great example but he had
 

6211
01:56:24,900 --> 01:56:27,169
that's not a great example but he had
thousands of examples and I was like

6212
01:56:27,169 --> 01:56:27,179
thousands of examples and I was like
 

6213
01:56:27,179 --> 01:56:29,149
thousands of examples and I was like
that's amazing like I would have never

6214
01:56:29,149 --> 01:56:29,159
that's amazing like I would have never
 

6215
01:56:29,159 --> 01:56:31,010
that's amazing like I would have never
thought to do that and I'm glad that

6216
01:56:31,010 --> 01:56:31,020
thought to do that and I'm glad that
 

6217
01:56:31,020 --> 01:56:33,290
thought to do that and I'm glad that
somebody did and that's also part of the

6218
01:56:33,290 --> 01:56:33,300
somebody did and that's also part of the
 

6219
01:56:33,300 --> 01:56:35,689
somebody did and that's also part of the
openness of the system and also I think

6220
01:56:35,689 --> 01:56:35,699
openness of the system and also I think
 

6221
01:56:35,699 --> 01:56:38,750
openness of the system and also I think
being a charity being you know this idea

6222
01:56:38,750 --> 01:56:38,760
being a charity being you know this idea
 

6223
01:56:38,760 --> 01:56:41,390
being a charity being you know this idea
of like actually this is a gift to the

6224
01:56:41,390 --> 01:56:41,400
of like actually this is a gift to the
 

6225
01:56:41,400 --> 01:56:44,750
of like actually this is a gift to the
world uh that makes someone go oh oh

6226
01:56:44,750 --> 01:56:44,760
world uh that makes someone go oh oh
 

6227

6231
01:56:48,360 --> 01:56:50,270
piece of things that I can make better
because I'm a good programmer and I can

6232
01:56:50,270 --> 01:56:50,280
because I'm a good programmer and I can
 

6233
01:56:50,280 --> 01:56:51,709
because I'm a good programmer and I can
write this script to do this thing and

I'll find it fun

6236
01:56:53,570 --> 01:56:53,580
I'll find it fun
 

6237

that's that's the kind of interesting
point that I

6726
02:06:03,350 --> 02:06:03,360
point that I
 

6727
02:06:03,360 --> 02:06:05,270
point that I
um I don't even know if there's a

6728
02:06:05,270 --> 02:06:05,280
um I don't even know if there's a
 

6729
02:06:05,280 --> 02:06:07,189
um I don't even know if there's a
competitor there may be this sort of

6730
02:06:07,189 --> 02:06:07,199
competitor there may be this sort of

programming stack Overflow type of

6732
02:06:08,870 --> 02:06:08,880
programming stack Overflow type of
 

6733
02:06:08,880 --> 02:06:10,550
programming stack Overflow type of
websites but everything else there's

6734
02:06:10,550 --> 02:06:10,560
websites but everything else there's
 

6735
02:06:10,560 --> 02:06:13,010
websites but everything else there's
always a trade-off there's a big it's

6736
02:06:13,010 --> 02:06:13,020
always a trade-off there's a big it's
 

6737
02:06:13,020 --> 02:06:14,450
always a trade-off there's a big it's
probably because of the ad driven model

6738
02:06:14,450 --> 02:06:14,460
probably because of the ad driven model
 

6739
02:06:14,460 --> 02:06:16,550
probably because of the ad driven model
because there's an incentive to pull you

6740
02:06:16,550 --> 02:06:16,560
because there's an incentive to pull you
 

6741
02:06:16,560 --> 02:06:18,649
because there's an incentive to pull you
into click bait yeah and Wikipedia has

6742
02:06:18,649 --> 02:06:18,659
into click bait yeah and Wikipedia has
 

6743
02:06:18,659 --> 02:06:21,050
into click bait yeah and Wikipedia has
no clickbait it's all about the quality

6744
02:06:21,050 --> 02:06:21,060
no clickbait it's all about the quality
 

6745
02:06:21,060 --> 02:06:22,550
no clickbait it's all about the quality
of the knowledge and the wisdom and so

6746
02:06:22,550 --> 02:06:22,560
of the knowledge and the wisdom and so
 

6747
02:06:22,560 --> 02:06:24,649
of the knowledge and the wisdom and so
on no that's right and I I also like

6748
02:06:24,649 --> 02:06:24,659
on no that's right and I I also like
 

6749
02:06:24,659 --> 02:06:26,270
on no that's right and I I also like
stack overall although I wonder I wonder

6750
02:06:26,270 --> 02:06:26,280
stack overall although I wonder I wonder
 

6751
02:06:26,280 --> 02:06:28,149
stack overall although I wonder I wonder
what you think of this

6752
02:06:28,149 --> 02:06:28,159
what you think of this
 

6753
02:06:28,159 --> 02:06:31,609
what you think of this
I've I so I only program for fun as a

6754
02:06:31,609 --> 02:06:31,619
I've I so I only program for fun as a
 

6755
02:06:31,619 --> 02:06:32,870
I've I so I only program for fun as a
hobby and I don't have enough time to do

6756
02:06:32,870 --> 02:06:32,880
hobby and I don't have enough time to do
 

6757
02:06:32,880 --> 02:06:36,530
hobby and I don't have enough time to do
it but I do and I'm not very good at it

6758
02:06:36,530 --> 02:06:36,540
it but I do and I'm not very good at it
 

6759
02:06:36,540 --> 02:06:38,270
it but I do and I'm not very good at it
so therefore I end up on stack Overflow

6760
02:06:38,270 --> 02:06:38,280
so therefore I end up on stack Overflow
 

6761
02:06:38,280 --> 02:06:40,070
so therefore I end up on stack Overflow
quite a lot trying to figure out what's

6762
02:06:40,070 --> 02:06:40,080
quite a lot trying to figure out what's
 

6763
02:06:40,080 --> 02:06:42,470
quite a lot trying to figure out what's
gone wrong and I have really

6764
02:06:42,470 --> 02:06:42,480
gone wrong and I have really
 

6765
02:06:42,480 --> 02:06:46,729
gone wrong and I have really
transitioned to using uh chat gbt yeah

transitioned to using uh chat gbt yeah
 

6767
02:06:46,739 --> 02:06:48,530
transitioned to using uh chat gbt yeah
much more for that because I can often

6768
02:06:48,530 --> 02:06:48,540
much more for that because I can often
 

6769
02:06:48,540 --> 02:06:52,010
much more for that because I can often
find the answer clearly explained

6770
02:06:52,010 --> 02:06:52,020
find the answer clearly explained
 

6771
02:06:52,020 --> 02:06:54,410
find the answer clearly explained
and it just it works better than sifting

6772
02:06:54,410 --> 02:06:54,420
and it just it works better than sifting
 

6773
02:06:54,420 --> 02:06:55,669
and it just it works better than sifting
through threads and I kind of feel bad

6774
02:06:55,669 --> 02:06:55,679
through threads and I kind of feel bad
 

6775
02:06:55,679 --> 02:06:57,350
through threads and I kind of feel bad
about that because I do love stack

6776
02:06:57,350 --> 02:06:57,360
about that because I do love stack
 

6777
02:06:57,360 --> 02:06:59,030
about that because I do love stack

still figure that out and so we we are
 

6809
02:07:32,520 --> 02:07:34,310
still figure that out and so we we are
similar in that regard like obviously

they provide proper links we're going to
 

7071
02:12:24,300 --> 02:12:25,550
they provide proper links we're going to
be at the top of that just like we are

7072
02:12:25,550 --> 02:12:25,560
be at the top of that just like we are
 

7073
02:12:25,560 --> 02:12:27,229
be at the top of that just like we are
in Google so we're still going to get

7074
02:12:27,229 --> 02:12:27,239
in Google so we're still going to get
 

7075
02:12:27,239 --> 02:12:29,270
in Google so we're still going to get
tons of recognition and tons of traffic

7076
02:12:29,270 --> 02:12:29,280
tons of recognition and tons of traffic
 

7077
02:12:29,280 --> 02:12:32,830
tons of recognition and tons of traffic
just from even if it's just the moral

7078
02:12:32,830 --> 02:12:32,840
just from even if it's just the moral
 

7079
02:12:32,840 --> 02:12:36,770
just from even if it's just the moral
properness of saying here's my source

block
 

7597
02:22:12,060 --> 02:22:13,429
block
well knock yourself out you're going to

7598
02:22:13,429 --> 02:22:13,439
well knock yourself out you're going to
 

7599

lose Wikipedia and that's been very

7600

lose Wikipedia and that's been very
 

7601
02:22:15,420 --> 02:22:18,410
lose Wikipedia and that's been very
successful for us as a strategy

7602
02:22:18,410 --> 02:22:18,420
successful for us as a strategy
 

7603
02:22:18,420 --> 02:22:21,110
successful for us as a strategy
um because governments know they can't

7604
02:22:21,110 --> 02:22:21,120
um because governments know they can't
 

7605
02:22:21,120 --> 02:22:22,490

7609
02:22:24,479 --> 02:22:25,849
Wikipedia or block us for two days and

02:22:25,849 --> 02:22:25,859
we're going to cave in immediately to
 

7611

7613
02:22:28,319 --> 02:22:29,929
get back into the market and that's what
a lot of companies have done and I don't

7614
02:22:29,929 --> 02:22:29,939
a lot of companies have done and I don't
 

7615
02:22:29,939 --> 02:22:31,250
a lot of companies have done and I don't
think that's good

7616
02:22:31,250 --> 02:22:31,260
think that's good
 

7617
02:22:31,260 --> 02:22:34,610
think that's good
we can go one level deeper and say I'm

7618
02:22:34,610 --> 02:22:34,620
we can go one level deeper and say I'm
 

7619
02:22:34,620 --> 02:22:36,230
we can go one level deeper and say I'm
actually quite sympathetic like if you

7620
02:22:36,230 --> 02:22:36,240
actually quite sympathetic like if you
 

7621
02:22:36,240 --> 02:22:39,230
actually quite sympathetic like if you
have staff members in a certain country

7622
02:22:39,230 --> 02:22:39,240
have staff members in a certain country
 

7623
02:22:39,240 --> 02:22:41,750
have staff members in a certain country
and they are at physical risk you've got

7624
02:22:41,750 --> 02:22:41,760
and they are at physical risk you've got
 

7625
02:22:41,760 --> 02:22:43,670
and they are at physical risk you've got
to put that into your equation so I

7626
02:22:43,670 --> 02:22:43,680
to put that into your equation so I
 

7627
02:22:43,680 --> 02:22:45,830
to put that into your equation so I
understand that like if if Elon said

7628
02:22:45,830 --> 02:22:45,840
understand that like if if Elon said
 

7629
02:22:45,840 --> 02:22:48,050
understand that like if if Elon said
actually I've got 100 staff members on

7630
02:22:48,050 --> 02:22:48,060
actually I've got 100 staff members on
 

7631
02:22:48,060 --> 02:22:49,610
actually I've got 100 staff members on
the ground in such and such a country

7632
02:22:49,610 --> 02:22:49,620
the ground in such and such a country
 

7633
02:22:49,620 --> 02:22:52,910
the ground in such and such a country
and if we don't comply somebody's going

7634
02:22:52,910 --> 02:22:52,920
and if we don't comply somebody's going
 

7635
02:22:52,920 --> 02:22:54,290
and if we don't comply somebody's going
to get arrested and it could be quite

7636
02:22:54,290 --> 02:22:54,300
to get arrested and it could be quite
 

7637
02:22:54,300 --> 02:22:55,429
to get arrested and it could be quite
serious

7638
02:22:55,429 --> 02:22:55,439
serious
 

7639
02:22:55,439 --> 02:22:57,590
serious
okay that's a tough one right that's

7640
02:22:57,590 --> 02:22:57,600
okay that's a tough one right that's
 

7641
02:22:57,600 --> 02:22:59,929
okay that's a tough one right that's
that's actually really hard

7642
02:22:59,929 --> 02:22:59,939
that's actually really hard
 

7643
02:22:59,939 --> 02:23:00,770
that's actually really hard

7889
02:27:26,040 --> 02:27:30,349
it's a battle of ideas and here's how
yes the sources are used yeah what are

7890
02:27:30,349 --> 02:27:30,359
yes the sources are used yeah what are
 

7891

I suppose there's some battle about what
 

7897
02:27:35,520 --> 02:27:37,429
I suppose there's some battle about what
is a legitimate Source there could be

02:27:40,680 --> 02:27:44,929
statements made that CDC I mean like
there's uh government organizations

7902
02:27:44,929 --> 02:27:44,939
there's uh government organizations
 

7903
02:27:44,939 --> 02:27:48,230
there's uh government organizations
in general have sold themselves to be

7904
02:27:48,230 --> 02:27:48,240
in general have sold themselves to be
 

7905
02:27:48,240 --> 02:27:51,349

the place where you go for expertise and

7906
02:27:51,349 --> 02:27:51,359
the place where you go for expertise and
 

7907
02:27:51,359 --> 02:27:54,950
the place where you go for expertise and
some of that has been uh to small degree

7908
02:27:54,950 --> 02:27:54,960
some of that has been uh to small degree
 

7909
02:27:54,960 --> 02:27:57,290
some of that has been uh to small degree
raised in question over the response to

7910
02:27:57,290 --> 02:27:57,300
raised in question over the response to
 

7911
02:27:57,300 --> 02:28:00,530
raised in question over the response to
the pandemic I think in many cases and

7912
02:28:00,530 --> 02:28:00,540
the pandemic I think in many cases and
 

7913
02:28:00,540 --> 02:28:03,770
the pandemic I think in many cases and
this goes back to my topic of trust

7914
02:28:03,770 --> 02:28:03,780
this goes back to my topic of trust
 

7915
02:28:03,780 --> 02:28:07,309
this goes back to my topic of trust
so there were definitely cases of public

7916
02:28:07,309 --> 02:28:07,319
so there were definitely cases of public
 

7917
02:28:07,319 --> 02:28:10,849
so there were definitely cases of public
officials public organizations

7918
02:28:10,849 --> 02:28:10,859
officials public organizations
 

7919
02:28:10,859 --> 02:28:14,030
officials public organizations
where I felt like they lost the trust of

7920
02:28:14,030 --> 02:28:14,040
where I felt like they lost the trust of
 

7921
02:28:14,040 --> 02:28:15,830
where I felt like they lost the trust of
the public because they didn't trust the

7922
02:28:15,830 --> 02:28:15,840
the public because they didn't trust the
 

7923
02:28:15,840 --> 02:28:19,250
the public because they didn't trust the
public yeah and so the idea is like we

7924
02:28:19,250 --> 02:28:19,260
public yeah and so the idea is like we
 

7925
02:28:19,260 --> 02:28:20,570
public yeah and so the idea is like we
really need people to take this

7926
02:28:20,570 --> 02:28:20,580
really need people to take this
 

7927
02:28:20,580 --> 02:28:22,550
really need people to take this
seriously and take actions therefore

7928
02:28:22,550 --> 02:28:22,560
seriously and take actions therefore
 

7929
02:28:22,560 --> 02:28:25,490
seriously and take actions therefore
we're gonna put out some overblown

7930
02:28:25,490 --> 02:28:25,500
we're gonna put out some overblown
 

7931
02:28:25,500 --> 02:28:27,590
we're gonna put out some overblown
claims because it's going to scare

7932
02:28:27,590 --> 02:28:27,600
claims because it's going to scare
 

7933
02:28:27,600 --> 02:28:29,690
claims because it's going to scare
people into behaving correctly you know

7934
02:28:29,690 --> 02:28:29,700
people into behaving correctly you know
 

7935
02:28:29,700 --> 02:28:31,969
people into behaving correctly you know
what that might work for a little while

7936
02:28:31,969 --> 02:28:31,979
what that might work for a little while
 

7937
02:28:31,979 --> 02:28:33,889
what that might work for a little while
but it doesn't work in the long run

7938
02:28:33,889 --> 02:28:33,899
but it doesn't work in the long run
 

7939
02:28:33,899 --> 02:28:36,349
but it doesn't work in the long run
because suddenly people go from a

7940
02:28:36,349 --> 02:28:36,359
because suddenly people go from a
 

7941
02:28:36,359 --> 02:28:38,990
because suddenly people go from a
default stance of like the Center for

I'm like
I think I can sit in the park and read a

8234
02:33:57,530 --> 02:33:57,540
I think I can sit in the park and read a
 

8235
02:33:57,540 --> 02:33:59,929

8237
02:33:59,939 --> 02:34:01,849

that's irrational rule which I would

8238
02:34:01,849 --> 02:34:01,859
that's irrational rule which I would
 

8239
02:34:01,859 --> 02:34:03,830
that's irrational rule which I would
have been following just personally of

thing yeah and the loss of trust I think

8244
02:34:08,090 --> 02:34:08,100
thing yeah and the loss of trust I think
 

8245
02:34:08,100 --> 02:34:10,550
thing yeah and the loss of trust I think
at scale was probably harmful to science

8246
02:34:10,550 --> 02:34:10,560
at scale was probably harmful to science
 

8247
02:34:10,560 --> 02:34:14,150
at scale was probably harmful to science
and to me the scientific method and the

8248
02:34:14,150 --> 02:34:14,160
and to me the scientific method and the
 

8249
02:34:14,160 --> 02:34:17,270
and to me the scientific method and the
scientific Community is is uh one of the

8250
02:34:17,270 --> 02:34:17,280
scientific Community is is uh one of the
 

8251
02:34:17,280 --> 02:34:20,090
scientific Community is is uh one of the
biggest hopes at least to me for the

8252
02:34:20,090 --> 02:34:20,100
biggest hopes at least to me for the
 

8253
02:34:20,100 --> 02:34:21,650
biggest hopes at least to me for the
survival and the thriving of human

8254
02:34:21,650 --> 02:34:21,660
survival and the thriving of human
 

8255
02:34:21,660 --> 02:34:24,349
survival and the thriving of human
civilization absolutely and I you know I

8256
02:34:24,349 --> 02:34:24,359
civilization absolutely and I you know I
 

8257
02:34:24,359 --> 02:34:27,110
civilization absolutely and I you know I
think you see some of the ramifications

8258
02:34:27,110 --> 02:34:27,120
think you see some of the ramifications
 

8259
02:34:27,120 --> 02:34:30,830
think you see some of the ramifications
of this there's always been like pretty

8260
02:34:30,830 --> 02:34:30,840
of this there's always been like pretty
 

8261
02:34:30,840 --> 02:34:34,010
of this there's always been like pretty
anti-science anti-vax people okay that's

8262
02:34:34,010 --> 02:34:34,020
anti-science anti-vax people okay that's
 

8263
02:34:34,020 --> 02:34:35,330
anti-science anti-vax people okay that's
always been a thing but I feel like it's

8264
02:34:35,330 --> 02:34:35,340
always been a thing but I feel like it's
 

8265
02:34:35,340 --> 02:34:39,110
always been a thing but I feel like it's

to face some of this all that uh I
always say one of the things that people

02:49:30,660 --> 02:49:32,210
good like it's actually not bad it used
to be half a joke and then for a while

9048
02:49:32,210 --> 02:49:32,220
to be half a joke and then for a while
 

9049
02:49:32,220 --> 02:49:33,410
to be half a joke and then for a while
it was kind of like well you can get the

9050
02:49:33,410 --> 02:49:33,420
it was kind of like well you can get the
 

9051
02:49:33,420 --> 02:49:34,610
it was kind of like well you can get the
gist of something and now it's like

9052
02:49:34,610 --> 02:49:34,620
gist of something and now it's like
 

9053
02:49:34,620 --> 02:49:36,410
gist of something and now it's like
actually it's pretty good

9054
02:49:36,410 --> 02:49:36,420
actually it's pretty good
 

9055
02:49:36,420 --> 02:49:37,910
actually it's pretty good
however we've got a huge Spanish

9056
02:49:37,910 --> 02:49:37,920
however we've got a huge Spanish

Community who write in Native Spanish so

9058
02:49:40,250 --> 02:49:40,260
Community who write in Native Spanish so
 

9059
02:49:40,260 --> 02:49:41,990
Community who write in Native Spanish so
they're able to use it and they find it

9060
02:49:41,990 --> 02:49:42,000
they're able to use it and they find it
 

9061
02:49:42,000 --> 02:49:43,849
they're able to use it and they find it
useful but they are writing

9062
02:49:43,849 --> 02:49:43,859
useful but they are writing
 

9063
02:49:43,859 --> 02:49:48,770
useful but they are writing
but if you tried to do English to Zulu

9064
02:49:48,770 --> 02:49:48,780
but if you tried to do English to Zulu
 

9065
02:49:48,780 --> 02:49:50,389
but if you tried to do English to Zulu
um where there's not that much

9066
02:49:50,389 --> 02:49:50,399
um where there's not that much
 

9067
02:49:50,399 --> 02:49:51,770
um where there's not that much
investment like there's loads of reasons

9068
02:49:51,770 --> 02:49:51,780
investment like there's loads of reasons
 

9069
02:49:51,780 --> 02:49:53,330
investment like there's loads of reasons
to invest in English to Spanish because

9070
02:49:53,330 --> 02:49:53,340
to invest in English to Spanish because
 

9071
02:49:53,340 --> 02:49:55,610
to invest in English to Spanish because
they're both huge economically important

9072
02:49:55,610 --> 02:49:55,620
they're both huge economically important
 

9073
02:49:55,620 --> 02:49:57,710
they're both huge economically important
languages Zulu not so much so for those

9074
02:49:57,710 --> 02:49:57,720
languages Zulu not so much so for those
 

9075
02:49:57,720 --> 02:49:59,210
languages Zulu not so much so for those
smaller languages it was just still

9076
02:49:59,210 --> 02:49:59,220
smaller languages it was just still
 

9077
02:49:59,220 --> 02:50:01,910
smaller languages it was just still
terrible my understanding is it's

9078
02:50:01,910 --> 02:50:01,920
terrible my understanding is it's
 

9079
02:50:01,920 --> 02:50:04,490
terrible my understanding is it's
improved dramatically and also because

9080
02:50:04,490 --> 02:50:04,500
improved dramatically and also because
 

9081
02:50:04,500 --> 02:50:06,889
improved dramatically and also because
the new methods of training don't

9082
02:50:06,889 --> 02:50:06,899
the new methods of training don't
 

9083
02:50:06,899 --> 02:50:10,010
the new methods of training don't
uh necessarily involve

9084
02:50:10,010 --> 02:50:10,020
uh necessarily involve
 

9085
02:50:10,020 --> 02:50:12,530
uh necessarily involve
identical corpuses to try to match

9086
02:50:12,530 --> 02:50:12,540
identical corpuses to try to match
 

9087
02:50:12,540 --> 02:50:15,530
identical corpuses to try to match
things up but rather reading and

9088
02:50:15,530 --> 02:50:15,540
things up but rather reading and
 

9089
02:50:15,540 --> 02:50:17,270
things up but rather reading and
understanding with tokens and large

9090
02:50:17,270 --> 02:50:17,280
understanding with tokens and large
 

9091
02:50:17,280 --> 02:50:19,250
understanding with tokens and large
language models and then reading and

9092
02:50:19,250 --> 02:50:19,260
language models and then reading and
 

9093
02:50:19,260 --> 02:50:20,690
language models and then reading and
understanding and then you get a much

9094
02:50:20,690 --> 02:50:20,700
understanding and then you get a much
 

9095
02:50:20,700 --> 02:50:23,150
understanding and then you get a much
richer anyway apparently it's quite

9096
02:50:23,150 --> 02:50:23,160
richer anyway apparently it's quite
 

9097
02:50:23,160 --> 02:50:25,610
richer anyway apparently it's quite
improved so I think that now

9098
02:50:25,610 --> 02:50:25,620
improved so I think that now
 

9099
02:50:25,620 --> 02:50:28,250
improved so I think that now
it is quite possible that these smaller

9100
02:50:28,250 --> 02:50:28,260
it is quite possible that these smaller
 

9101
02:50:28,260 --> 02:50:29,809
it is quite possible that these smaller
language communities are going to say oh

9102
02:50:29,809 --> 02:50:29,819
language communities are going to say oh
 

9103
02:50:29,819 --> 02:50:31,910
language communities are going to say oh
well finally I can put something in

9104
02:50:31,910 --> 02:50:31,920
well finally I can put something in
 

9105
02:50:31,920 --> 02:50:35,030
well finally I can put something in
English and I can get out Zulu that I

9106
02:50:35,030 --> 02:50:35,040
English and I can get out Zulu that I
 

9107
02:50:35,040 --> 02:50:36,710
English and I can get out Zulu that I
can that I feel comfortable sharing with

9108
02:50:36,710 --> 02:50:36,720
can that I feel comfortable sharing with
 

9109
02:50:36,720 --> 02:50:38,330
can that I feel comfortable sharing with
my community because it's actually good

9110
02:50:38,330 --> 02:50:38,340
my community because it's actually good
 

9111
02:50:38,340 --> 02:50:40,250
my community because it's actually good
enough or I can edit it a bit here and

9112
02:50:40,250 --> 02:50:40,260
enough or I can edit it a bit here and
 

9113
02:50:40,260 --> 02:50:42,230
enough or I can edit it a bit here and
there so I think that's huge so I do

9114
02:50:42,230 --> 02:50:42,240
there so I think that's huge so I do
 

9115
02:50:42,240 --> 02:50:43,429
there so I think that's huge so I do
think that's going to happen a lot and

9116
02:50:43,429 --> 02:50:43,439
think that's going to happen a lot and
 

9117
02:50:43,439 --> 02:50:45,170
think that's going to happen a lot and
that's going to accelerate again what

9118
02:50:45,170 --> 02:50:45,180
that's going to accelerate again what
 

9119
02:50:45,180 --> 02:50:46,730
that's going to accelerate again what
will remain to most people an invisible

9120
02:50:46,730 --> 02:50:46,740
will remain to most people an invisible
 

9121
02:50:46,740 --> 02:50:48,590
will remain to most people an invisible
Trend but that's the growth in in all

9122
02:50:48,590 --> 02:50:48,600
Trend but that's the growth in in all
 

9123
02:50:48,600 --> 02:50:49,910
Trend but that's the growth in in all
these other languages

9124
02:50:49,910 --> 02:50:49,920
these other languages
 

9125
02:50:49,920 --> 02:50:53,090
these other languages
so then move on to 100 years I was

9126
02:50:53,090 --> 02:50:53,100
so then move on to 100 years I was
 

9127
02:50:53,100 --> 02:50:55,370
so then move on to 100 years I was
starting to get scary well the only

9128
02:50:55,370 --> 02:50:55,380
starting to get scary well the only
 

9129
02:50:55,380 --> 02:50:58,090
starting to get scary well the only
thing I'll say about 100 years is like

9130
02:50:58,090 --> 02:50:58,100
thing I'll say about 100 years is like
 

9131
02:50:58,100 --> 02:51:03,830
thing I'll say about 100 years is like
we've built the Wikimedia Foundation

9132
02:51:03,830 --> 02:51:03,840
we've built the Wikimedia Foundation
 

9133
02:51:03,840 --> 02:51:07,010
we've built the Wikimedia Foundation
um and we run it in a quite cautious and

9134
02:51:07,010 --> 02:51:07,020
um and we run it in a quite cautious and
 

9135
02:51:07,020 --> 02:51:09,650
um and we run it in a quite cautious and
financially conservative and careful way

9136
02:51:09,650 --> 02:51:09,660
financially conservative and careful way
 

9137
02:51:09,660 --> 02:51:12,410
financially conservative and careful way
so every year we build our reserves

9138
02:51:12,410 --> 02:51:12,420
so every year we build our reserves
 

9139
02:51:12,420 --> 02:51:14,570
so every year we build our reserves
every year we put aside a little bit of

9140
02:51:14,570 --> 02:51:14,580
every year we put aside a little bit of
 

9141
02:51:14,580 --> 02:51:16,790
every year we put aside a little bit of
more money we also have the endowment

9142
02:51:16,790 --> 02:51:16,800
more money we also have the endowment
 

9143
02:51:16,800 --> 02:51:18,889
more money we also have the endowment
fund which we've just passed 100 million

9144
02:51:18,889 --> 02:51:18,899
fund which we've just passed 100 million
 

9145
02:51:18,899 --> 02:51:22,010
fund which we've just passed 100 million
that's a completely separate fund with a

9146
02:51:22,010 --> 02:51:22,020
that's a completely separate fund with a
 

9147
02:51:22,020 --> 02:51:23,570
that's a completely separate fund with a
separate board so that it's not just

9148
02:51:23,570 --> 02:51:23,580
separate board so that it's not just
 

9149
02:51:23,580 --> 02:51:25,190
separate board so that it's not just
like a big fat bank account for some

9150
02:51:25,190 --> 02:51:25,200
like a big fat bank account for some
 

9151
02:51:25,200 --> 02:51:26,870
like a big fat bank account for some
future profligence a year to blow

9152
02:51:26,870 --> 02:51:26,880
future profligence a year to blow
 

9153
02:51:26,880 --> 02:51:28,849
future profligence a year to blow
through that you know the foundation

9154
02:51:28,849 --> 02:51:28,859
through that you know the foundation
 

9155
02:51:28,859 --> 02:51:31,070
through that you know the foundation
will have to get the approval of a

9156
02:51:31,070 --> 02:51:31,080
will have to get the approval of a
 

9157
02:51:31,080 --> 02:51:33,349
will have to get the approval of a
second order board to be able to access

9158
02:51:33,349 --> 02:51:33,359
second order board to be able to access
 

9159
02:51:33,359 --> 02:51:35,870
second order board to be able to access
that money and that board can make other

9160
02:51:35,870 --> 02:51:35,880
that money and that board can make other
 

9161
02:51:35,880 --> 02:51:37,190
that money and that board can make other
grants through the community and things

9162
02:51:37,190 --> 02:51:37,200
grants through the community and things
 

9163
02:51:37,200 --> 02:51:38,450
grants through the community and things
like that

9164
02:51:38,450 --> 02:51:38,460
like that
 

9165
02:51:38,460 --> 02:51:41,690
like that
so the point of all that is I hope and

9166
02:51:41,690 --> 02:51:41,700
so the point of all that is I hope and
 

9167
02:51:41,700 --> 02:51:44,510
so the point of all that is I hope and
believe that we're building you know in

9168
02:51:44,510 --> 02:51:44,520
believe that we're building you know in
 

9169
02:51:44,520 --> 02:51:47,330
believe that we're building you know in
a financially stable way that we can

9170
02:51:47,330 --> 02:51:47,340
a financially stable way that we can
 

9171
02:51:47,340 --> 02:51:49,849
a financially stable way that we can
weather various storms along the way so

9172
02:51:49,849 --> 02:51:49,859
weather various storms along the way so
 

9173
02:51:49,859 --> 02:51:52,730
weather various storms along the way so
that hopefully we we're not we're not

9174
02:51:52,730 --> 02:51:52,740
that hopefully we we're not we're not
 

9175
02:51:52,740 --> 02:51:55,309
that hopefully we we're not we're not
taking the kind of risks and by the way

9176
02:51:55,309 --> 02:51:55,319
taking the kind of risks and by the way
 

9177
02:51:55,319 --> 02:51:57,170
taking the kind of risks and by the way
we're not taking too few risks either

9178
02:51:57,170 --> 02:51:57,180
we're not taking too few risks either
 

9179
02:51:57,180 --> 02:51:59,750
we're not taking too few risks either
that's always hard I think we'll the

that's always hard I think we'll the

Wikimedia foundation and Wikipedia will
 

9183
02:52:01,380 --> 02:52:04,490
Wikimedia foundation and Wikipedia will
exist in 100 years if anybody exists in

100 years you will be there do you think
the internet just looks unpredictably

uh this sort of enormous step forward
 

9195
02:52:18,479 --> 02:52:20,570
uh this sort of enormous step forward
we've seen has become public in the last

really interesting and you and I have
 

9203
02:52:27,660 --> 02:52:29,990
really interesting and you and I have
both talked today about the flaws and

9204
02:52:29,990 --> 02:52:30,000
both talked today about the flaws and
 

9205
02:52:30,000 --> 02:52:32,090
both talked today about the flaws and
the limitations but still it's as

9206
02:52:32,090 --> 02:52:32,100
the limitations but still it's as
 

9207
02:52:32,100 --> 02:52:33,769
the limitations but still it's as
someone who's been around technology for

9208
02:52:33,769 --> 02:52:33,779
someone who's been around technology for
 

9209
02:52:33,779 --> 02:52:34,849
someone who's been around technology for
a long time

9210
02:52:34,849 --> 02:52:34,859
a long time
 

9211
02:52:34,859 --> 02:52:37,010
a long time
I it's sort of that feeling of the first

9212
02:52:37,010 --> 02:52:37,020
I it's sort of that feeling of the first
 

9213
02:52:37,020 --> 02:52:39,290
I it's sort of that feeling of the first
time I saw a web browser the first time

9214
02:52:39,290 --> 02:52:39,300
time I saw a web browser the first time
 

9215
02:52:39,300 --> 02:52:41,630
time I saw a web browser the first time
I saw the iPhone like the first time the

9216
02:52:41,630 --> 02:52:41,640
I saw the iPhone like the first time the
 

9217
02:52:41,640 --> 02:52:43,309
I saw the iPhone like the first time the
internet was like really usable on a

9218
02:52:43,309 --> 02:52:43,319
internet was like really usable on a
 

9219
02:52:43,319 --> 02:52:45,469
internet was like really usable on a
phone and it's like wow that's that's a

9220
02:52:45,469 --> 02:52:45,479
phone and it's like wow that's that's a
 

9221
02:52:45,479 --> 02:52:47,630
phone and it's like wow that's that's a
step change difference there's a few

9222
02:52:47,630 --> 02:52:47,640
step change difference there's a few
 

9223
02:52:47,640 --> 02:52:49,610
step change difference there's a few
other you know maybe a Google search

9224
02:52:49,610 --> 02:52:49,620
other you know maybe a Google search
 

9225
02:52:49,620 --> 02:52:52,250
other you know maybe a Google search
Google search because I remember

9226
02:52:52,250 --> 02:52:52,260
Google search because I remember
 

9227
02:52:52,260 --> 02:52:54,170
Google search because I remember
Altavista was kind of cool for a while

9228
02:52:54,170 --> 02:52:54,180
Altavista was kind of cool for a while
 

9229
02:52:54,180 --> 02:52:55,610
Altavista was kind of cool for a while
then it just got more and more useless

9230
02:52:55,610 --> 02:52:55,620
then it just got more and more useless
 

9231
02:52:55,620 --> 02:52:57,469
then it just got more and more useless
because the algorithm wasn't good and

9232
02:52:57,469 --> 02:52:57,479
because the algorithm wasn't good and
 

9233
02:52:57,479 --> 02:52:58,969
because the algorithm wasn't good and
it's like oh Google Search now like the

9234
02:52:58,969 --> 02:52:58,979
it's like oh Google Search now like the

negative use case I'm you know people in
 

9249
02:53:15,120 --> 02:53:16,550
negative use case I'm you know people in
the area who are experts they're they're

9250
02:53:16,550 --> 02:53:16,560
the area who are experts they're they're
 

9251

02:53:22,130 --> 02:53:22,140
I'm a pathological optimist
 

9257
02:53:22,140 --> 02:53:24,590

partly because this particular Pope
 

9361
02:55:22,800 --> 02:55:24,950
partly because this particular Pope
doesn't seem like he'd be the type

9362
02:55:24,950 --> 02:55:24,960
doesn't seem like he'd be the type

people will care about the provenance of
 

9373

necessarily think that's the highest but

9380
02:55:48,050 --> 02:55:48,060
necessarily think that's the highest but
 

9381
02:55:48,060 --> 02:55:49,910
necessarily think that's the highest but
I'm like well it's a news organization

9382
02:55:49,910 --> 02:55:49,920
I'm like well it's a news organization
 

9383

I'm like well it's a news organization
and they're going to have journalists

9384
02:55:50,990 --> 02:55:51,000
and they're going to have journalists

02:55:54,830 --> 02:55:54,840
is what it purports to be
 

9389
02:55:54,840 --> 02:55:56,690

uh that's very different from a photo
 

9391
02:55:56,700 --> 02:55:58,370
uh that's very different from a photo

02:56:06,170 --> 02:56:06,180
cases the the worst you could do and
 

9399
02:56:06,180 --> 02:56:09,469
cases the the worst you could do and
this did happen is misrepresent the

02:56:09,469 --> 02:56:09,479
this did happen is misrepresent the
 

9401
02:56:09,479 --> 02:56:11,570
this did happen is misrepresent the
battlefield so like oh here's a bunch of

another case 10 years ago that has

9408
02:56:18,349 --> 02:56:18,359

another case 10 years ago that has
happened that has always been around but

happened that has always been around but
 

9411
02:56:21,240 --> 02:56:23,710
happened that has always been around but
now we can have much more

02:59:06,410 --> 02:59:06,420
piece of content and then each hopefully
 

9567
02:59:06,420 --> 02:59:08,150
piece of content and then each hopefully
there's millions of people with

it was huge it was viral it was lots of
things

9794
03:03:20,870 --> 03:03:20,880
things
 

9795
03:03:20,880 --> 03:03:22,849
things
kind of foreshadowed a bit of maybe even

9796
03:03:22,849 --> 03:03:22,859
kind of foreshadowed a bit of maybe even
 

9797
03:03:22,859 --> 03:03:24,710
kind of foreshadowed a bit of maybe even
Tick Tock because it was like a lot of

9798
03:03:24,710 --> 03:03:24,720
Tick Tock because it was like a lot of
 

9799
03:03:24,720 --> 03:03:27,530
Tick Tock because it was like a lot of
entertainment content casual

9800

entertainment content casual
 

9801
03:03:27,540 --> 03:03:31,309
entertainment content casual
um and then Rupert Murdoch bought it and

9802
03:03:31,309 --> 03:03:31,319
um and then Rupert Murdoch bought it and
 

9803
03:03:31,319 --> 03:03:33,410
um and then Rupert Murdoch bought it and
it collapsed within a few years

9804
03:03:33,410 --> 03:03:33,420
it collapsed within a few years
 

9805
03:03:33,420 --> 03:03:35,450
it collapsed within a few years
and part of that I think was because

9806
03:03:35,450 --> 03:03:35,460
and part of that I think was because
 

9807
03:03:35,460 --> 03:03:38,929
and part of that I think was because
they were really really heavy on ads and

9808
03:03:38,929 --> 03:03:38,939
they were really really heavy on ads and
 

9809
03:03:38,939 --> 03:03:40,969
they were really really heavy on ads and
less heavy on the customer experience so

9810
03:03:40,969 --> 03:03:40,979
less heavy on the customer experience so
 

9811
03:03:40,979 --> 03:03:43,190
less heavy on the customer experience so

think about

10130
03:09:30,050 --> 03:09:30,060
think about
 

10131
03:09:30,060 --> 03:09:32,330
think about
um sustainability

10132
03:09:32,330 --> 03:09:32,340
um sustainability
 

10133
03:09:32,340 --> 03:09:34,730
um sustainability
um and I mean

10134
03:09:34,730 --> 03:09:34,740
um and I mean
 

10135
03:09:34,740 --> 03:09:37,370
um and I mean
one million year sustainability

10136
03:09:37,370 --> 03:09:37,380
one million year sustainability
 

10137
03:09:37,380 --> 03:09:38,450
one million year sustainability
um and we don't have all the answer we

10138
03:09:38,450 --> 03:09:38,460
um and we don't have all the answer we
 

10139
03:09:38,460 --> 03:09:40,370
um and we don't have all the answer we
have nothing close to the answers I'm

10140
03:09:40,370 --> 03:09:40,380
have nothing close to the answers I'm
 

10141
03:09:40,380 --> 03:09:42,830
have nothing close to the answers I'm
actually excited about AI in this regard

10142
03:09:42,830 --> 03:09:42,840
actually excited about AI in this regard
 

10143
03:09:42,840 --> 03:09:45,170
actually excited about AI in this regard
while also bracketing yeah I understand

10144
03:09:45,170 --> 03:09:45,180
while also bracketing yeah I understand
 

10145
03:09:45,180 --> 03:09:46,610
while also bracketing yeah I understand
there's also risks and people are

10146
03:09:46,610 --> 03:09:46,620
there's also risks and people are
 

10147
03:09:46,620 --> 03:09:49,190
there's also risks and people are
terrified of AI but I actually think it

10148
03:09:49,190 --> 03:09:49,200
terrified of AI but I actually think it
 

10149
03:09:49,200 --> 03:09:51,889
terrified of AI but I actually think it
is quite interesting this moment in time

10150
03:09:51,889 --> 03:09:51,899
is quite interesting this moment in time
 

10151
03:09:51,899 --> 03:09:54,950
is quite interesting this moment in time
that we may have in the next 50 years

10152
03:09:54,950 --> 03:09:54,960
that we may have in the next 50 years
 

10153
03:09:54,960 --> 03:09:58,450
that we may have in the next 50 years
to really really solve some really

10154
03:09:58,450 --> 03:09:58,460
to really really solve some really
 

10155
03:09:58,460 --> 03:10:01,070
to really really solve some really
long-term human problems for example in

10156
03:10:01,070 --> 03:10:01,080
long-term human problems for example in
 

10157
03:10:01,080 --> 03:10:02,030
long-term human problems for example in
health

10158
03:10:02,030 --> 03:10:02,040
health
 

10159
03:10:02,040 --> 03:10:04,190
health
like the the progress that's being made

10160
03:10:04,190 --> 03:10:04,200
like the the progress that's being made
 

10161
03:10:04,200 --> 03:10:07,490
like the the progress that's being made
in cancer treatment because we are able

10162
03:10:07,490 --> 03:10:07,500
in cancer treatment because we are able
 

10163
03:10:07,500 --> 03:10:12,410
in cancer treatment because we are able
to at scale you know uh model molecules

10164
03:10:12,410 --> 03:10:12,420
to at scale you know uh model molecules
 

10165
03:10:12,420 --> 03:10:15,410
to at scale you know uh model molecules
and and genetics and things like this it

10166
03:10:15,410 --> 03:10:15,420
and and genetics and things like this it
 

10167
03:10:15,420 --> 03:10:17,570
and and genetics and things like this it
gets huge it's really exciting

10168
03:10:17,570 --> 03:10:17,580
gets huge it's really exciting
 

10169
03:10:17,580 --> 03:10:19,610
gets huge it's really exciting
um you know so if

10170
03:10:19,610 --> 03:10:19,620
um you know so if
 

10171
03:10:19,620 --> 03:10:21,950
um you know so if
um you know if we can hang on for a

10172
03:10:21,950 --> 03:10:21,960
um you know if we can hang on for a
 

10173
03:10:21,960 --> 03:10:23,170
um you know if we can hang on for a
little while

10174
03:10:23,170 --> 03:10:23,180
little while
 

10175
03:10:23,180 --> 03:10:25,910
little while
and you know certain problems that seem

10176
03:10:25,910 --> 03:10:25,920
and you know certain problems that seem
 

10177
03:10:25,920 --> 03:10:27,530
and you know certain problems that seem
completely intractable today like

10178
03:10:27,530 --> 03:10:27,540
completely intractable today like
 

10179
03:10:27,540 --> 03:10:29,269
completely intractable today like
climate change may end up being actually

10180
03:10:29,269 --> 03:10:29,279
climate change may end up being actually
 

10181
03:10:29,279 --> 03:10:31,910
climate change may end up being actually
not that hard and we might just might be

10182
03:10:31,910 --> 03:10:31,920
not that hard and we might just might be
 

10183
03:10:31,920 --> 03:10:34,370
not that hard and we might just might be
able to alleviate the full diversity of

10184
03:10:34,370 --> 03:10:34,380
able to alleviate the full diversity of
 

10185
03:10:34,380 --> 03:10:35,630
able to alleviate the full diversity of
human suffering

10186
03:10:35,630 --> 03:10:35,640
human suffering
 

10187
03:10:35,640 --> 03:10:39,650
human suffering
for sure yeah and uh and so doing uh

10188
03:10:39,650 --> 03:10:39,660
for sure yeah and uh and so doing uh
 

10189
03:10:39,660 --> 03:10:41,929
for sure yeah and uh and so doing uh
help increase the chance that we can

10190
03:10:41,929 --> 03:10:41,939
help increase the chance that we can
 

10191
03:10:41,939 --> 03:10:43,670
help increase the chance that we can
propagate the flame of human

10192
03:10:43,670 --> 03:10:43,680
propagate the flame of human
 

10193
03:10:43,680 --> 03:10:46,130
propagate the flame of human
consciousness out into the towards the

10194
03:10:46,130 --> 03:10:46,140
consciousness out into the towards the
 

10195
03:10:46,140 --> 03:10:48,769
consciousness out into the towards the
stars and I think another important one

10196
03:10:48,769 --> 03:10:48,779
stars and I think another important one
 

10197
03:10:48,779 --> 03:10:51,170
stars and I think another important one
if we fail to do that

10198
03:10:51,170 --> 03:10:51,180
if we fail to do that
 

10199
03:10:51,180 --> 03:10:55,070
if we fail to do that
for me it's propagating maintaining the

10200
03:10:55,070 --> 03:10:55,080
for me it's propagating maintaining the
 

10201
03:10:55,080 --> 03:10:57,650
for me it's propagating maintaining the
uh the full diversity and richness and

10202
03:10:57,650 --> 03:10:57,660
uh the full diversity and richness and
 

10203
03:10:57,660 --> 03:11:00,650
uh the full diversity and richness and
complexity and expansiveness of human

10204
03:11:00,650 --> 03:11:00,660
complexity and expansiveness of human
 

10205
03:11:00,660 --> 03:11:04,370
complexity and expansiveness of human
knowledge so if we destroy ourselves it

10206
03:11:04,370 --> 03:11:04,380
knowledge so if we destroy ourselves it
 

10207
03:11:04,380 --> 03:11:06,590
knowledge so if we destroy ourselves it
would it would make me feel a little bit

10208
03:11:06,590 --> 03:11:06,600
would it would make me feel a little bit
 

10209
03:11:06,600 --> 03:11:09,830
would it would make me feel a little bit
okay yeah you just if the human now just

10210
03:11:09,830 --> 03:11:09,840
okay yeah you just if the human now just
 

10211
03:11:09,840 --> 03:11:11,510
okay yeah you just if the human now just
triggered me to say something really

10212
03:11:11,510 --> 03:11:11,520
triggered me to say something really
 

10213
03:11:11,520 --> 03:11:14,990
triggered me to say something really
interesting which is uh when we talked

10214
03:11:14,990 --> 03:11:15,000
interesting which is uh when we talked
 

10215
03:11:15,000 --> 03:11:17,510
interesting which is uh when we talked
earlier about translating and using

10216
03:11:17,510 --> 03:11:17,520
earlier about translating and using
 

10217
03:11:17,520 --> 03:11:20,030
earlier about translating and using
machines to translate we mostly talked

10218
03:11:20,030 --> 03:11:20,040
machines to translate we mostly talked
 

10219
03:11:20,040 --> 03:11:22,130
machines to translate we mostly talked
about small languages and translating

10220
03:11:22,130 --> 03:11:22,140
about small languages and translating
 

10221
03:11:22,140 --> 03:11:23,809
about small languages and translating
into English but I always like to tell

10222
03:11:23,809 --> 03:11:23,819
into English but I always like to tell
 

10223
03:11:23,819 --> 03:11:26,330
into English but I always like to tell
this story of something inconsequential

10224
03:11:26,330 --> 03:11:26,340
this story of something inconsequential
 

10225
03:11:26,340 --> 03:11:29,990
this story of something inconsequential
really but there's uh I was in Norway in

10226
03:11:29,990 --> 03:11:30,000
really but there's uh I was in Norway in
 

10227
03:11:30,000 --> 03:11:31,790
really but there's uh I was in Norway in
Bergen Norway where every year they've

10228
03:11:31,790 --> 03:11:31,800
Bergen Norway where every year they've
 

10229
03:11:31,800 --> 03:11:34,010
Bergen Norway where every year they've
got this Annual Festival called buekor

10230
03:11:34,010 --> 03:11:34,020
got this Annual Festival called buekor
 

10231
03:11:34,020 --> 03:11:37,790
got this Annual Festival called buekor
which is Young uh groups drumming and

10232
03:11:37,790 --> 03:11:37,800
which is Young uh groups drumming and
 

10233
03:11:37,800 --> 03:11:39,290
which is Young uh groups drumming and
they have a drumming competition it's

10234
03:11:39,290 --> 03:11:39,300
they have a drumming competition it's
 

10235
03:11:39,300 --> 03:11:41,269
they have a drumming competition it's
the 17 sectors of the city and they've

10236
03:11:41,269 --> 03:11:41,279
the 17 sectors of the city and they've
 

10237
03:11:41,279 --> 03:11:42,349
the 17 sectors of the city and they've
been doing it for a couple hundred years

10238
03:11:42,349 --> 03:11:42,359
been doing it for a couple hundred years
 

10239
03:11:42,359 --> 03:11:43,429
been doing it for a couple hundred years
or whatever

10240
03:11:43,429 --> 03:11:43,439
or whatever
 

10241
03:11:43,439 --> 03:11:46,250
or whatever
they wrote about it in uh the three

10242
03:11:46,250 --> 03:11:46,260
they wrote about it in uh the three
 

10243
03:11:46,260 --> 03:11:49,130
they wrote about it in uh the three
languages of Norway and then from there

10244
03:11:49,130 --> 03:11:49,140
languages of Norway and then from there
 

10245
03:11:49,140 --> 03:11:50,990
languages of Norway and then from there
it was translated into English into

10246
03:11:50,990 --> 03:11:51,000
it was translated into English into
 

10247
03:11:51,000 --> 03:11:52,849
it was translated into English into
German etc etc

10248
03:11:52,849 --> 03:11:52,859
German etc etc
 

10249
03:11:52,859 --> 03:11:55,250
German etc etc
and so what what I love about that story

10250
03:11:55,250 --> 03:11:55,260
and so what what I love about that story
 

10251
03:11:55,260 --> 03:11:57,410
and so what what I love about that story
is what it reminds me is like this

10252
03:11:57,410 --> 03:11:57,420
is what it reminds me is like this
 

10253
03:11:57,420 --> 03:12:01,070
is what it reminds me is like this
machine translation goes both ways and

10254
03:12:01,070 --> 03:12:01,080
machine translation goes both ways and
 

10255
03:12:01,080 --> 03:12:02,809
machine translation goes both ways and
like when you talk about the richness

10256
03:12:02,809 --> 03:12:02,819
like when you talk about the richness
 

10257
03:12:02,819 --> 03:12:05,269
like when you talk about the richness
and broadness of human culture we're

10258
03:12:05,269 --> 03:12:05,279
and broadness of human culture we're
 

10259
03:12:05,279 --> 03:12:07,849
and broadness of human culture we're
already seeing some really great pieces

10260
03:12:07,849 --> 03:12:07,859
already seeing some really great pieces
 

10261
03:12:07,859 --> 03:12:11,269
already seeing some really great pieces
of this so like Korean soap operas

10262
03:12:11,269 --> 03:12:11,279
of this so like Korean soap operas
 

10263
03:12:11,279 --> 03:12:13,070
of this so like Korean soap operas
really popular not with me but with

10264
03:12:13,070 --> 03:12:13,080
really popular not with me but with
 

10265
03:12:13,080 --> 03:12:16,010
really popular not with me but with
people and the ability to

10266
03:12:16,010 --> 03:12:16,020
people and the ability to
 

10267
03:12:16,020 --> 03:12:17,150
people and the ability to
you know

10268
03:12:17,150 --> 03:12:17,160
you know
 

10269
03:12:17,160 --> 03:12:20,210
you know
imagine taking a very famous very

10270
03:12:20,210 --> 03:12:20,220
imagine taking a very famous very
 

10271
03:12:20,220 --> 03:12:23,690
imagine taking a very famous very
popular very well-known Korean drama

10272
03:12:23,690 --> 03:12:23,700
popular very well-known Korean drama
 

10273
03:12:23,700 --> 03:12:26,210
popular very well-known Korean drama
and now I mean and I literally mean now

10274
03:12:26,210 --> 03:12:26,220
and now I mean and I literally mean now
 

10275
03:12:26,220 --> 03:12:28,910
and now I mean and I literally mean now
we're just about there technologically

10276
03:12:28,910 --> 03:12:28,920
we're just about there technologically
 

10277
03:12:28,920 --> 03:12:31,429
we're just about there technologically
where we use a machine to

10278
03:12:31,429 --> 03:12:31,439
where we use a machine to
 

10279
03:12:31,439 --> 03:12:34,250
where we use a machine to
redub it in English in an automated way

10280
03:12:34,250 --> 03:12:34,260
redub it in English in an automated way
 

10281
03:12:34,260 --> 03:12:37,250
redub it in English in an automated way
including digitally editing the faces so

10282
03:12:37,250 --> 03:12:37,260
including digitally editing the faces so
 

10283
03:12:37,260 --> 03:12:39,910
including digitally editing the faces so
it doesn't look dubbed and so suddenly

10284
03:12:39,910 --> 03:12:39,920
it doesn't look dubbed and so suddenly
 

10285
03:12:39,920 --> 03:12:42,710
it doesn't look dubbed and so suddenly
you say oh wow like here's here's a
