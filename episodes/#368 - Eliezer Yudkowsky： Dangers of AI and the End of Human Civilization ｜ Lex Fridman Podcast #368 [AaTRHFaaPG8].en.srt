what do you think about gpt4 how

40
00:00:45,590 --> 00:00:45,600
what do you think about gpt4 how
 

41
00:00:45,600 --> 00:00:46,970
what do you think about gpt4 how
intelligent is it

42
00:00:46,970 --> 00:00:46,980
intelligent is it
 

43
00:00:46,980 --> 00:00:48,889
intelligent is it
it is a bit smarter than I thought this

44
00:00:48,889 --> 00:00:48,899
it is a bit smarter than I thought this
 

45
00:00:48,899 --> 00:00:51,290
it is a bit smarter than I thought this
technology was going to scale to

46
00:00:51,290 --> 00:00:51,300
technology was going to scale to
 

47
00:00:51,300 --> 00:00:54,049
technology was going to scale to
and I'm a bit worried about what the

48
00:00:54,049 --> 00:00:54,059
and I'm a bit worried about what the
 

49
00:00:54,059 --> 00:00:56,389
and I'm a bit worried about what the
next one will be like like this

50
00:00:56,389 --> 00:00:56,399
next one will be like like this
 

51
00:00:56,399 --> 00:00:58,069
next one will be like like this
particular one I think

52
00:00:58,069 --> 00:00:58,079
particular one I think
 

53
00:00:58,079 --> 00:01:00,410
particular one I think
I hope there's nobody inside there

54
00:01:00,410 --> 00:01:00,420
I hope there's nobody inside there
 

55
00:01:00,420 --> 00:01:02,209
I hope there's nobody inside there
because you know it would be sucked to

56
00:01:02,209 --> 00:01:02,219
because you know it would be sucked to
 

57
00:01:02,219 --> 00:01:04,670
because you know it would be sucked to
be stuck inside there

58
00:01:04,670 --> 00:01:04,680
be stuck inside there
 

59
00:01:04,680 --> 00:01:06,710
be stuck inside there
um but we don't even know the

60
00:01:06,710 --> 00:01:06,720
um but we don't even know the
 

61
00:01:06,720 --> 00:01:08,630
um but we don't even know the
architecture at this point because open

62
00:01:08,630 --> 00:01:08,640
architecture at this point because open

00:01:12,439 --> 00:01:15,350
and
yeah like giant inscrutable matrices of

what's going on in there nobody's goes
 

73
00:01:18,360 --> 00:01:19,789
what's going on in there nobody's goes
knows what's going on in there all we

74
00:01:19,789 --> 00:01:19,799
knows what's going on in there all we
 

75
00:01:19,799 --> 00:01:21,530
knows what's going on in there all we
have to go by are the external metrics

76
00:01:21,530 --> 00:01:21,540
have to go by are the external metrics
 

77
00:01:21,540 --> 00:01:25,370
have to go by are the external metrics
and on the external metrics if you

78
00:01:25,370 --> 00:01:25,380
and on the external metrics if you
 

79
00:01:25,380 --> 00:01:29,030
and on the external metrics if you
ask it to write a self-aware fortune

80
00:01:29,030 --> 00:01:29,040
ask it to write a self-aware fortune
 

81
00:01:29,040 --> 00:01:32,090
ask it to write a self-aware fortune
green text it will start writing a green

82
00:01:32,090 --> 00:01:32,100
green text it will start writing a green
 

83
00:01:32,100 --> 00:01:34,370
green text it will start writing a green
text about how it has realized that it's

84
00:01:34,370 --> 00:01:34,380
text about how it has realized that it's
 

85
00:01:34,380 --> 00:01:37,310
text about how it has realized that it's
an AI writing a green text and like oh

86
00:01:37,310 --> 00:01:37,320
an AI writing a green text and like oh
 

87
00:01:37,320 --> 00:01:39,310
an AI writing a green text and like oh
well so

88
00:01:39,310 --> 00:01:39,320
well so
 

89
00:01:39,320 --> 00:01:43,569
well so
that's probably

90
00:01:43,569 --> 00:01:43,579

 

91
00:01:43,579 --> 00:01:46,609

not quite what's going on in there in

92
00:01:46,609 --> 00:01:46,619
not quite what's going on in there in
 

93
00:01:46,619 --> 00:01:47,990
not quite what's going on in there in
reality

94
00:01:47,990 --> 00:01:48,000
reality
 

95
00:01:48,000 --> 00:01:49,609
reality
um but we're kind of like blowing past

96
00:01:49,609 --> 00:01:49,619
um but we're kind of like blowing past
 

97
00:01:49,619 --> 00:01:51,950
um but we're kind of like blowing past
all these science fiction guard rails

98
00:01:51,950 --> 00:01:51,960
all these science fiction guard rails
 

99
00:01:51,960 --> 00:01:54,649
all these science fiction guard rails
like we are past the point where in

100
00:01:54,649 --> 00:01:54,659
like we are past the point where in
 

101
00:01:54,659 --> 00:01:56,090
like we are past the point where in
science fiction people would be like

102
00:01:56,090 --> 00:01:56,100
science fiction people would be like
 

103
00:01:56,100 --> 00:01:58,670
science fiction people would be like
whoa wait stop that thing's live what

104
00:01:58,670 --> 00:01:58,680
whoa wait stop that thing's live what
 

105
00:01:58,680 --> 00:02:00,109
whoa wait stop that thing's live what
are you doing to it

106
00:02:00,109 --> 00:02:00,119
are you doing to it
 

107
00:02:00,119 --> 00:02:03,109
are you doing to it
and it's probably not

108
00:02:03,109 --> 00:02:03,119
and it's probably not
 

109
00:02:03,119 --> 00:02:05,450
and it's probably not
nobody actually knows we don't have any

110
00:02:05,450 --> 00:02:05,460
nobody actually knows we don't have any
 

111
00:02:05,460 --> 00:02:08,089
nobody actually knows we don't have any
other guard rails we don't have any

112
00:02:08,089 --> 00:02:08,099
other guard rails we don't have any
 

113
00:02:08,099 --> 00:02:10,910
other guard rails we don't have any
other tests we don't have any lines to

114
00:02:10,910 --> 00:02:10,920
other tests we don't have any lines to
 

115
00:02:10,920 --> 00:02:12,290
other tests we don't have any lines to
draw on the sand and say like well when

116
00:02:12,290 --> 00:02:12,300
draw on the sand and say like well when
 

117
00:02:12,300 --> 00:02:15,589
draw on the sand and say like well when
we get this far we will start to worry

118
00:02:15,589 --> 00:02:15,599
we get this far we will start to worry
 

119
00:02:15,599 --> 00:02:16,570
we get this far we will start to worry
about

120
00:02:16,570 --> 00:02:16,580
about
 

121
00:02:16,580 --> 00:02:19,369
about
what's inside there

122
00:02:19,369 --> 00:02:19,379
what's inside there
 

123
00:02:19,379 --> 00:02:21,170
what's inside there
so if it were up to me I would be like

124
00:02:21,170 --> 00:02:21,180
so if it were up to me I would be like
 

125
00:02:21,180 --> 00:02:24,890
so if it were up to me I would be like
okay like this far no further time for

126
00:02:24,890 --> 00:02:24,900
okay like this far no further time for
 

127
00:02:24,900 --> 00:02:27,589
okay like this far no further time for
the summer of AI where we have planted

128
00:02:27,589 --> 00:02:27,599
the summer of AI where we have planted
 

129
00:02:27,599 --> 00:02:30,410
the summer of AI where we have planted
our seeds and now we like wait and reap

130
00:02:30,410 --> 00:02:30,420
our seeds and now we like wait and reap
 

131
00:02:30,420 --> 00:02:31,850
our seeds and now we like wait and reap
the rewards of the technology we've

132
00:02:31,850 --> 00:02:31,860
the rewards of the technology we've
 

133
00:02:31,860 --> 00:02:33,350
the rewards of the technology we've
already developed and don't do any

134
00:02:33,350 --> 00:02:33,360
already developed and don't do any
 

135
00:02:33,360 --> 00:02:35,630
already developed and don't do any
larger training runs than that which to

136
00:02:35,630 --> 00:02:35,640
larger training runs than that which to
 

137
00:02:35,640 --> 00:02:37,790
larger training runs than that which to
be clear I realize requires more than

138
00:02:37,790 --> 00:02:37,800
be clear I realize requires more than
 

139
00:02:37,800 --> 00:02:41,809
be clear I realize requires more than
one company agreeing to not do that

140
00:02:41,809 --> 00:02:41,819

 

141
00:02:41,819 --> 00:02:44,869

and take a rigorous approach for the

142
00:02:44,869 --> 00:02:44,879
and take a rigorous approach for the
 

143
00:02:44,879 --> 00:02:48,350
and take a rigorous approach for the
whole AI Community to uh investigate

144
00:02:48,350 --> 00:02:48,360
whole AI Community to uh investigate
 

145
00:02:48,360 --> 00:02:50,270
whole AI Community to uh investigate
whether there's somebody inside there

146
00:02:50,270 --> 00:02:50,280
whether there's somebody inside there
 

147
00:02:50,280 --> 00:02:53,410
whether there's somebody inside there
that would take decades

148
00:02:53,410 --> 00:02:53,420
that would take decades
 

149
00:02:53,420 --> 00:02:55,910
that would take decades

there's somebody in there but as I feel

00:03:08,580 --> 00:03:10,009
Alan Turing tried to come up with with
the touring test

166
00:03:10,009 --> 00:03:10,019
the touring test
 

167
00:03:10,019 --> 00:03:12,050
the touring test
do you think it's possible to

168
00:03:12,050 --> 00:03:12,060
do you think it's possible to
 

169
00:03:12,060 --> 00:03:13,729
do you think it's possible to
definitively

170
00:03:13,729 --> 00:03:13,739
definitively
 

171
00:03:13,739 --> 00:03:16,130
definitively
or approximately figure out if there is

172
00:03:16,130 --> 00:03:16,140
or approximately figure out if there is
 

173
00:03:16,140 --> 00:03:18,710
or approximately figure out if there is
somebody in there if there's something

174
00:03:18,710 --> 00:03:18,720
somebody in there if there's something
 

175
00:03:18,720 --> 00:03:21,830
somebody in there if there's something
like a mind inside this large language

176
00:03:21,830 --> 00:03:21,840
like a mind inside this large language

model
 

179
00:03:23,040 --> 00:03:25,130
model
I mean there's a whole bunch of

180
00:03:25,130 --> 00:03:25,140
I mean there's a whole bunch of
 

181
00:03:25,140 --> 00:03:27,890
I mean there's a whole bunch of
different sub questions here there's the

182
00:03:27,890 --> 00:03:27,900
different sub questions here there's the
 

183
00:03:27,900 --> 00:03:29,630
different sub questions here there's the
question of

184
00:03:29,630 --> 00:03:29,640
question of
 

185
00:03:29,640 --> 00:03:30,850
question of
like

186
00:03:30,850 --> 00:03:30,860
like
 

187
00:03:30,860 --> 00:03:33,770
like
is there Consciousness is there qualia

188
00:03:33,770 --> 00:03:33,780
is there Consciousness is there qualia
 

189
00:03:33,780 --> 00:03:37,130
is there Consciousness is there qualia
is this a object of moral concern is the

190
00:03:37,130 --> 00:03:37,140
is this a object of moral concern is the
 

191
00:03:37,140 --> 00:03:39,229
is this a object of moral concern is the
same oral patient

192
00:03:39,229 --> 00:03:39,239
same oral patient
 

193
00:03:39,239 --> 00:03:41,270
same oral patient
um like should we be worried about how

194
00:03:41,270 --> 00:03:41,280
um like should we be worried about how
 

195
00:03:41,280 --> 00:03:42,949
um like should we be worried about how
we're treating it

196
00:03:42,949 --> 00:03:42,959
we're treating it
 

197
00:03:42,959 --> 00:03:45,110
we're treating it
and then there's questions like how

198
00:03:45,110 --> 00:03:45,120
and then there's questions like how
 

199
00:03:45,120 --> 00:03:47,630
and then there's questions like how
smart is it exactly can it do X can it

200
00:03:47,630 --> 00:03:47,640
smart is it exactly can it do X can it
 

201
00:03:47,640 --> 00:03:50,390
smart is it exactly can it do X can it
do y and we can check how it can do X

202
00:03:50,390 --> 00:03:50,400
do y and we can check how it can do X
 

203
00:03:50,400 --> 00:03:52,970
do y and we can check how it can do X
and how it can do y

204
00:03:52,970 --> 00:03:52,980
and how it can do y
 

205
00:03:52,980 --> 00:03:55,130
and how it can do y
um unfortunately we've gone and exposed

206
00:03:55,130 --> 00:03:55,140
um unfortunately we've gone and exposed
 

207
00:03:55,140 --> 00:03:57,770

00:05:02,570 --> 00:05:02,580
think therefore I am and all that and
 

267
00:05:02,580 --> 00:05:05,030
think therefore I am and all that and
then try to interrogate that model

268
00:05:05,030 --> 00:05:05,040
then try to interrogate that model
 

269
00:05:05,040 --> 00:05:07,370
then try to interrogate that model
and see what it says and it still would

270
00:05:07,370 --> 00:05:07,380
and see what it says and it still would
 

271
00:05:07,380 --> 00:05:08,510
and see what it says and it still would
not be definitive

272
00:05:08,510 --> 00:05:08,520
not be definitive
 

273
00:05:08,520 --> 00:05:10,850
not be definitive
but nonetheless uh

274
00:05:10,850 --> 00:05:10,860
but nonetheless uh

over this science fiction guard rails
 

279
00:05:14,759 --> 00:05:17,689
over this science fiction guard rails
like maybe this thing but what about gbt

280
00:05:17,689 --> 00:05:17,699
like maybe this thing but what about gbt
 

281
00:05:17,699 --> 00:05:19,490
like maybe this thing but what about gbt
maybe maybe not this thing but like what

maybe maybe not this thing but like what
 

283
00:05:19,500 --> 00:05:22,490
maybe maybe not this thing but like what
about gpt5 you know this this would be a

about gpt5 you know this this would be a
 

285
00:05:22,500 --> 00:05:25,790
about gpt5 you know this this would be a
good place to to pause

286
00:05:25,790 --> 00:05:25,800
good place to to pause
 

287
00:05:25,800 --> 00:05:28,010

on the topic of cautiousness you know

288
00:05:28,010 --> 00:05:28,020
on the topic of cautiousness you know
 

289
00:05:28,020 --> 00:05:31,189
on the topic of cautiousness you know
there's so many components

290
00:05:31,189 --> 00:05:31,199
there's so many components
 

291
00:05:31,199 --> 00:05:33,529
there's so many components
to even just removing Consciousness from

292
00:05:33,529 --> 00:05:33,539
to even just removing Consciousness from
 

293
00:05:33,539 --> 00:05:36,189
to even just removing Consciousness from
the data set

294
00:05:36,189 --> 00:05:36,199

 

295
00:05:36,199 --> 00:05:38,749

emotion the display of Consciousness the

296
00:05:38,749 --> 00:05:38,759
emotion the display of Consciousness the
 

297
00:05:38,759 --> 00:05:41,330
emotion the display of Consciousness the
display of emotion feels like deeply

298
00:05:41,330 --> 00:05:41,340
display of emotion feels like deeply
 

299
00:05:41,340 --> 00:05:42,950
display of emotion feels like deeply
integrated with the experience of

integrated with the experience of
 

301
00:05:42,960 --> 00:05:44,570
integrated with the experience of

consciousness
 

303
00:05:44,580 --> 00:05:46,370
consciousness
so the hard problem seems to be very

304
00:05:46,370 --> 00:05:46,380
so the hard problem seems to be very
 

305
00:05:46,380 --> 00:05:49,370
so the hard problem seems to be very
well integrated with the actual surface

306

well integrated with the actual surface
 

307
00:05:49,380 --> 00:05:51,529
well integrated with the actual surface
level illusion of Consciousness so

308
00:05:51,529 --> 00:05:51,539
level illusion of Consciousness so
 

309
00:05:51,539 --> 00:05:53,150
level illusion of Consciousness so
displaying emotion

310
00:05:53,150 --> 00:05:53,160
displaying emotion
 

311
00:05:53,160 --> 00:05:54,830
displaying emotion
I mean do you think there's a case to be

312
00:05:54,830 --> 00:05:54,840
I mean do you think there's a case to be
 

313
00:05:54,840 --> 00:05:58,070
I mean do you think there's a case to be
made that we humans when we're babies

314
00:05:58,070 --> 00:05:58,080
made that we humans when we're babies
 

315
00:05:58,080 --> 00:06:00,590
made that we humans when we're babies
are just like gbt that we're training on

316
00:06:00,590 --> 00:06:00,600
are just like gbt that we're training on
 

317
00:06:00,600 --> 00:06:02,390
are just like gbt that we're training on
human data on how to display emotion

318
00:06:02,390 --> 00:06:02,400
human data on how to display emotion
 

319
00:06:02,400 --> 00:06:05,029
human data on how to display emotion
versus feel emotion how to show others

00:06:05,029 --> 00:06:05,039
versus feel emotion how to show others
 

321
00:06:05,039 --> 00:06:06,950
versus feel emotion how to show others
communicate others

322
00:06:06,950 --> 00:06:06,960
communicate others
 

323
00:06:06,960 --> 00:06:10,070
communicate others
that I'm suffering that I'm excited that

we need that training data as humans too
that we may not be born with that how to

and go off and study
um what goes on inside Transformer

um then in

00:08:42,949 --> 00:08:42,959
um then in
 

461
00:08:42,959 --> 00:08:45,710
um then in
you know like 30 40 years uh we'd

462
00:08:45,710 --> 00:08:45,720
you know like 30 40 years uh we'd
 

463
00:08:45,720 --> 00:08:47,329
you know like 30 40 years uh we'd
probably have a pretty good idea

464
00:08:47,329 --> 00:08:47,339
probably have a pretty good idea
 

465
00:08:47,339 --> 00:08:49,790
probably have a pretty good idea
do you think these large language models

466
00:08:49,790 --> 00:08:49,800
do you think these large language models
 

467
00:08:49,800 --> 00:08:51,949
do you think these large language models
can reason

468
00:08:51,949 --> 00:08:51,959
can reason
 

469
00:08:51,959 --> 00:08:54,050
can reason
they can play chess how are they doing

470
00:08:54,050 --> 00:08:54,060
they can play chess how are they doing
 

471
00:08:54,060 --> 00:08:55,670
they can play chess how are they doing
that without reasoning

472
00:08:55,670 --> 00:08:55,680
that without reasoning
 

473
00:08:55,680 --> 00:08:56,870
that without reasoning
so

474
00:08:56,870 --> 00:08:56,880
so
 

475
00:08:56,880 --> 00:08:58,850
so
you're somebody that spearheaded the

476
00:08:58,850 --> 00:08:58,860
you're somebody that spearheaded the
 

477
00:08:58,860 --> 00:09:01,070
you're somebody that spearheaded the
movement of rationality so reason is

478
00:09:01,070 --> 00:09:01,080
movement of rationality so reason is
 

479
00:09:01,080 --> 00:09:02,509
movement of rationality so reason is
important to you

480
00:09:02,509 --> 00:09:02,519
important to you
 

481
00:09:02,519 --> 00:09:04,970
important to you
is so is that as a powerful important

482
00:09:04,970 --> 00:09:04,980
is so is that as a powerful important
 

483
00:09:04,980 --> 00:09:08,630
is so is that as a powerful important
word or is it like how difficult is the

484
00:09:08,630 --> 00:09:08,640
word or is it like how difficult is the
 

485
00:09:08,640 --> 00:09:10,490
word or is it like how difficult is the
threshold of being able to reason to you

486
00:09:10,490 --> 00:09:10,500
threshold of being able to reason to you
 

487
00:09:10,500 --> 00:09:13,550
threshold of being able to reason to you
and how impressive is it I mean

488
00:09:13,550 --> 00:09:13,560
and how impressive is it I mean
 

489
00:09:13,560 --> 00:09:15,889
and how impressive is it I mean
in my writings on rationality I have not

490
00:09:15,889 --> 00:09:15,899
in my writings on rationality I have not
 

491
00:09:15,899 --> 00:09:17,690
in my writings on rationality I have not
gone making a big deal out of something

492
00:09:17,690 --> 00:09:17,700
gone making a big deal out of something
 

493
00:09:17,700 --> 00:09:20,750
gone making a big deal out of something
called reason I have made more of a big

494
00:09:20,750 --> 00:09:20,760
called reason I have made more of a big
 

495
00:09:20,760 --> 00:09:22,550
called reason I have made more of a big
deal out of something called probability

496
00:09:22,550 --> 00:09:22,560
deal out of something called probability
 

497
00:09:22,560 --> 00:09:23,570
deal out of something called probability
Theory

498
00:09:23,570 --> 00:09:23,580
Theory
 

499
00:09:23,580 --> 00:09:27,829
Theory
and that's like well your reasoning but

500
00:09:27,829 --> 00:09:27,839
and that's like well your reasoning but
 

501
00:09:27,839 --> 00:09:29,930
and that's like well your reasoning but
you're not doing it quite right

502
00:09:29,930 --> 00:09:29,940
you're not doing it quite right
 

503
00:09:29,940 --> 00:09:32,509
you're not doing it quite right
and you should reason this way instead

504
00:09:32,509 --> 00:09:32,519
and you should reason this way instead
 

505
00:09:32,519 --> 00:09:36,710
and you should reason this way instead
and interestingly like people have

506
00:09:36,710 --> 00:09:36,720
and interestingly like people have
 

507
00:09:36,720 --> 00:09:38,210
and interestingly like people have
started to get preliminary results

508
00:09:38,210 --> 00:09:38,220
started to get preliminary results
 

509
00:09:38,220 --> 00:09:40,030
started to get preliminary results
showing that

510
00:09:40,030 --> 00:09:40,040
showing that
 

511
00:09:40,040 --> 00:09:43,210
showing that
reinforcement learning by human feedback

512
00:09:43,210 --> 00:09:43,220
reinforcement learning by human feedback
 

513
00:09:43,220 --> 00:09:48,050
reinforcement learning by human feedback
has made the GPT series worse in some

514
00:09:48,050 --> 00:09:48,060
has made the GPT series worse in some
 

515
00:09:48,060 --> 00:09:49,190
has made the GPT series worse in some
ways

516
00:09:49,190 --> 00:09:49,200
ways
 

517
00:09:49,200 --> 00:09:51,410
ways
in particular like it used to be well

518
00:09:51,410 --> 00:09:51,420
in particular like it used to be well
 

519
00:09:51,420 --> 00:09:52,910
in particular like it used to be well
calibrated if you trained it to put

520
00:09:52,910 --> 00:09:52,920
calibrated if you trained it to put
 

521
00:09:52,920 --> 00:09:55,250
calibrated if you trained it to put
probabilities on things it would say 80

522
00:09:55,250 --> 00:09:55,260
probabilities on things it would say 80
 

523
00:09:55,260 --> 00:09:57,590
probabilities on things it would say 80
probability and we write eight times out

524
00:09:57,590 --> 00:09:57,600
probability and we write eight times out
 

525
00:09:57,600 --> 00:10:00,350
probability and we write eight times out
of ten and if you apply reinforcement

526
00:10:00,350 --> 00:10:00,360
of ten and if you apply reinforcement
 

527
00:10:00,360 --> 00:10:02,449
of ten and if you apply reinforcement
learning from Human feedback the the

528
00:10:02,449 --> 00:10:02,459
learning from Human feedback the the
 

529
00:10:02,459 --> 00:10:06,710
learning from Human feedback the the
like nice graph of like like 70 7 out of

530
00:10:06,710 --> 00:10:06,720
like nice graph of like like 70 7 out of
 

531
00:10:06,720 --> 00:10:07,730
like nice graph of like like 70 7 out of
ten

532
00:10:07,730 --> 00:10:07,740
ten
 

533
00:10:07,740 --> 00:10:10,190
ten
sort of like flattens out into the graph

534
00:10:10,190 --> 00:10:10,200
sort of like flattens out into the graph
 

535
00:10:10,200 --> 00:10:11,810
sort of like flattens out into the graph
that humans use where there's like some

536
00:10:11,810 --> 00:10:11,820
that humans use where there's like some
 

537
00:10:11,820 --> 00:10:14,350
that humans use where there's like some
very improbable stuff and

538
00:10:14,350 --> 00:10:14,360
very improbable stuff and
 

539
00:10:14,360 --> 00:10:17,509
very improbable stuff and
likely probable maybe which all means

540
00:10:17,509 --> 00:10:17,519
likely probable maybe which all means
 

541
00:10:17,519 --> 00:10:19,490
likely probable maybe which all means
like around 40 percent and then certain

542
00:10:19,490 --> 00:10:19,500
like around 40 percent and then certain
 

543
00:10:19,500 --> 00:10:21,530
like around 40 percent and then certain
yeah so like it's like it used to be

544
00:10:21,530 --> 00:10:21,540
yeah so like it's like it used to be
 

545
00:10:21,540 --> 00:10:23,210
yeah so like it's like it used to be
able to use probabilities but if you

546
00:10:23,210 --> 00:10:23,220
able to use probabilities but if you
 

547
00:10:23,220 --> 00:10:25,130
able to use probabilities but if you
apply but if you'd like try to teach it

548
00:10:25,130 --> 00:10:25,140
apply but if you'd like try to teach it
 

549
00:10:25,140 --> 00:10:26,990
apply but if you'd like try to teach it
to talk in a way that satisfies humans

550
00:10:26,990 --> 00:10:27,000
to talk in a way that satisfies humans
 

551
00:10:27,000 --> 00:10:29,389
to talk in a way that satisfies humans
it it gets worse at probability in the

552
00:10:29,389 --> 00:10:29,399
it it gets worse at probability in the
 

553
00:10:29,399 --> 00:10:31,910
it it gets worse at probability in the
same way that humans are and that's uh

554
00:10:31,910 --> 00:10:31,920
same way that humans are and that's uh
 

555
00:10:31,920 --> 00:10:34,250
same way that humans are and that's uh
that's a bug not a feature I would call

556
00:10:34,250 --> 00:10:34,260
that's a bug not a feature I would call
 

557
00:10:34,260 --> 00:10:35,990
that's a bug not a feature I would call
it a bug

558
00:10:35,990 --> 00:10:36,000
it a bug
 

559
00:10:36,000 --> 00:10:39,290
it a bug
although such a fascinating bug

560
00:10:39,290 --> 00:10:39,300
although such a fascinating bug
 

561
00:10:39,300 --> 00:10:42,949
although such a fascinating bug
um but but but yeah so so like reasoning

562
00:10:42,949 --> 00:10:42,959
um but but but yeah so so like reasoning
 

563
00:10:42,959 --> 00:10:46,310
um but but but yeah so so like reasoning
like it's doing pretty well on various

564
00:10:46,310 --> 00:10:46,320
like it's doing pretty well on various
 

565
00:10:46,320 --> 00:10:48,230
like it's doing pretty well on various
tests that people used to say would

566
00:10:48,230 --> 00:10:48,240
tests that people used to say would
 

567
00:10:48,240 --> 00:10:50,750
tests that people used to say would
require reasoning but

568
00:10:50,750 --> 00:10:50,760
require reasoning but
 

569
00:10:50,760 --> 00:10:53,389
require reasoning but
um you know rationality is about

570
00:10:53,389 --> 00:10:53,399
um you know rationality is about
 

571
00:10:53,399 --> 00:10:55,370
um you know rationality is about
when you say eighty percent doesn't

572
00:10:55,370 --> 00:10:55,380
when you say eighty percent doesn't
 

573
00:10:55,380 --> 00:10:57,769
when you say eighty percent doesn't
happen eight times out of ten

574
00:10:57,769 --> 00:10:57,779
happen eight times out of ten
 

575
00:10:57,779 --> 00:11:00,730
happen eight times out of ten
so what are the limits to you of these

576
00:11:00,730 --> 00:11:00,740
so what are the limits to you of these
 

577
00:11:00,740 --> 00:11:02,810
so what are the limits to you of these

reasoning is not impressive to you or it

582
00:11:09,350 --> 00:11:09,360
reasoning is not impressive to you or it
 

583
00:11:09,360 --> 00:11:11,990
reasoning is not impressive to you or it
is impressive but there's other levels

584
00:11:11,990 --> 00:11:12,000
is impressive but there's other levels
 

585
00:11:12,000 --> 00:11:13,670
is impressive but there's other levels
to achieve I mean it's just not how I

586
00:11:13,670 --> 00:11:13,680
to achieve I mean it's just not how I
 

587
00:11:13,680 --> 00:11:15,170
to achieve I mean it's just not how I
carve up reality

588
00:11:15,170 --> 00:11:15,180
carve up reality
 

589
00:11:15,180 --> 00:11:18,290
carve up reality
what's uh if reality is a cake

590
00:11:18,290 --> 00:11:18,300
what's uh if reality is a cake
 

591
00:11:18,300 --> 00:11:20,630
what's uh if reality is a cake
what are the different layers of the

592
00:11:20,630 --> 00:11:20,640
what are the different layers of the
 

593
00:11:20,640 --> 00:11:22,670
what are the different layers of the
cake or the slices how do you cover it

594
00:11:22,670 --> 00:11:22,680
cake or the slices how do you cover it
 

595
00:11:22,680 --> 00:11:24,889
cake or the slices how do you cover it
but you can use a different food if you

596
00:11:24,889 --> 00:11:24,899
but you can use a different food if you
 

597
00:11:24,899 --> 00:11:27,250
but you can use a different food if you
like

598
00:11:27,250 --> 00:11:27,260

 

599
00:11:27,260 --> 00:11:30,170

it's I don't think it's as smart as a

600
00:11:30,170 --> 00:11:30,180
it's I don't think it's as smart as a
 

601
00:11:30,180 --> 00:11:31,190
it's I don't think it's as smart as a
human yet

602
00:11:31,190 --> 00:11:31,200
human yet
 

603
00:11:31,200 --> 00:11:33,170
human yet
um I do like back in the day I went

604
00:11:33,170 --> 00:11:33,180
um I do like back in the day I went
 

605
00:11:33,180 --> 00:11:35,930
um I do like back in the day I went
around saying like I do not think that

606
00:11:35,930 --> 00:11:35,940
around saying like I do not think that
 

607
00:11:35,940 --> 00:11:37,910
around saying like I do not think that
just stacking more layers of

608
00:11:37,910 --> 00:11:37,920
just stacking more layers of
 

609
00:11:37,920 --> 00:11:39,470
just stacking more layers of
Transformers is going to get you all the

610
00:11:39,470 --> 00:11:39,480
Transformers is going to get you all the
 

611
00:11:39,480 --> 00:11:43,430
Transformers is going to get you all the
way to AGI and I think that's gpt4 is

612
00:11:43,430 --> 00:11:43,440
way to AGI and I think that's gpt4 is
 

613
00:11:43,440 --> 00:11:45,710
way to AGI and I think that's gpt4 is
passed or I thought this Paradigm was

614
00:11:45,710 --> 00:11:45,720
passed or I thought this Paradigm was
 

615
00:11:45,720 --> 00:11:46,850
passed or I thought this Paradigm was
going to take us

616
00:11:46,850 --> 00:11:46,860
going to take us
 

617
00:11:46,860 --> 00:11:50,269
going to take us
and I you know you want to notice when

618
00:11:50,269 --> 00:11:50,279
and I you know you want to notice when
 

619
00:11:50,279 --> 00:11:52,069
and I you know you want to notice when
that happens you want to say like whoops

620
00:11:52,069 --> 00:11:52,079
that happens you want to say like whoops
 

621
00:11:52,079 --> 00:11:54,710
that happens you want to say like whoops
well I guess I was incorrect about what

622
00:11:54,710 --> 00:11:54,720
well I guess I was incorrect about what
 

623
00:11:54,720 --> 00:11:56,150
well I guess I was incorrect about what
happens if you keep on stacking more

624
00:11:56,150 --> 00:11:56,160
happens if you keep on stacking more
 

625
00:11:56,160 --> 00:11:58,370
happens if you keep on stacking more
Transformer layers and that means I

626
00:11:58,370 --> 00:11:58,380
Transformer layers and that means I
 

627
00:11:58,380 --> 00:12:00,170
Transformer layers and that means I
don't necessarily know what gpt5 is

628
00:12:00,170 --> 00:12:00,180
don't necessarily know what gpt5 is
 

629
00:12:00,180 --> 00:12:01,970
don't necessarily know what gpt5 is
going to be able to do that's a powerful

630
00:12:01,970 --> 00:12:01,980
going to be able to do that's a powerful
 

631
00:12:01,980 --> 00:12:04,130
going to be able to do that's a powerful
statement so you're saying like your

632
00:12:04,130 --> 00:12:04,140
statement so you're saying like your
 

633
00:12:04,140 --> 00:12:07,490
statement so you're saying like your
intuition initially is now appears to be

634
00:12:07,490 --> 00:12:07,500
intuition initially is now appears to be
 

635
00:12:07,500 --> 00:12:10,550
intuition initially is now appears to be
wrong yeah

636
00:12:10,550 --> 00:12:10,560
wrong yeah
 

637
00:12:10,560 --> 00:12:13,550
wrong yeah
it's good to see that you can admit in

638
00:12:13,550 --> 00:12:13,560
it's good to see that you can admit in
 

639
00:12:13,560 --> 00:12:15,530
it's good to see that you can admit in
some of your predictions to be wrong

640
00:12:15,530 --> 00:12:15,540
some of your predictions to be wrong
 

641
00:12:15,540 --> 00:12:17,569
some of your predictions to be wrong
do you think that's important to do see

642
00:12:17,569 --> 00:12:17,579
do you think that's important to do see
 

643
00:12:17,579 --> 00:12:20,150
do you think that's important to do see
because you make several very throughout

644
00:12:20,150 --> 00:12:20,160
because you make several very throughout
 

645
00:12:20,160 --> 00:12:22,490
because you make several very throughout
your life you've made many strong

646
00:12:22,490 --> 00:12:22,500
your life you've made many strong
 

647
00:12:22,500 --> 00:12:24,949
your life you've made many strong
predictions and statements about reality

648
00:12:24,949 --> 00:12:24,959
predictions and statements about reality
 

649
00:12:24,959 --> 00:12:27,710
predictions and statements about reality
and you evolve with that so maybe

650
00:12:27,710 --> 00:12:27,720
and you evolve with that so maybe
 

651
00:12:27,720 --> 00:12:29,150
and you evolve with that so maybe
that'll come up today about our

that'll come up today about our
 

653
00:12:29,160 --> 00:12:32,329
that'll come up today about our
discussion so you're okay being wrong

654
00:12:32,329 --> 00:12:32,339
discussion so you're okay being wrong
 

655

less wrong
 

685
00:13:08,279 --> 00:13:11,030
less wrong
I suppose that's the objective function

686
00:13:11,030 --> 00:13:11,040
I suppose that's the objective function
 

687
00:13:11,040 --> 00:13:13,610

the name less wrong was I believe uh

688
00:13:13,610 --> 00:13:13,620
the name less wrong was I believe uh
 

689

just become less wrong

696
00:13:23,629 --> 00:13:23,639
just become less wrong
 

697

an AI to make a picture of what it looks
 

763
00:14:38,519 --> 00:14:39,470
an AI to make a picture of what it looks
like

764
00:14:39,470 --> 00:14:39,480
like
 

765
00:14:39,480 --> 00:14:40,970
like
um not just because we're two different

person but also because

person but also because
the AI was trained by imitation in a way

774
00:14:50,810 --> 00:14:50,820
the AI was trained by imitation in a way
 

775
00:14:50,820 --> 00:14:53,110
the AI was trained by imitation in a way
that makes it very difficult to guess

776
00:14:53,110 --> 00:14:53,120
that makes it very difficult to guess
 

777
00:14:53,120 --> 00:14:55,269
that makes it very difficult to guess
how much of that it really understood

778
00:14:55,269 --> 00:14:55,279
how much of that it really understood
 

779
00:14:55,279 --> 00:15:00,050
how much of that it really understood
and probably not actually a whole bunch

780
00:15:00,050 --> 00:15:00,060
and probably not actually a whole bunch
 

781
00:15:00,060 --> 00:15:02,389
and probably not actually a whole bunch
um although although gpt4 is like

782
00:15:02,389 --> 00:15:02,399
um although although gpt4 is like
 

783
00:15:02,399 --> 00:15:05,290
um although although gpt4 is like
multimodal and can like draw vector

784
00:15:05,290 --> 00:15:05,300
multimodal and can like draw vector
 

785
00:15:05,300 --> 00:15:08,030
multimodal and can like draw vector
drawings of things that make sense and

786
00:15:08,030 --> 00:15:08,040
drawings of things that make sense and
 

787
00:15:08,040 --> 00:15:10,030
drawings of things that make sense and
like does appear to have some kind of

788
00:15:10,030 --> 00:15:10,040
like does appear to have some kind of
 

789
00:15:10,040 --> 00:15:12,650
like does appear to have some kind of
spatial visualization going on in there

790
00:15:12,650 --> 00:15:12,660
spatial visualization going on in there
 

791
00:15:12,660 --> 00:15:15,350
spatial visualization going on in there
but like the the pretty picture of the

792
00:15:15,350 --> 00:15:15,360
but like the the pretty picture of the
 

793
00:15:15,360 --> 00:15:17,810
but like the the pretty picture of the
like girl with the

she looked like like it didn't see that

800

in full detail
 

803
00:15:28,260 --> 00:15:30,230
in full detail
it just like made a description of it

804
00:15:30,230 --> 00:15:30,240
it just like made a description of it
 

805
00:15:30,240 --> 00:15:32,990
it just like made a description of it
and stable diffusion output it and

806
00:15:32,990 --> 00:15:33,000
and stable diffusion output it and
 

807
00:15:33,000 --> 00:15:35,930
and stable diffusion output it and
there's the concern about

808
00:15:35,930 --> 00:15:35,940
there's the concern about
 

809
00:15:35,940 --> 00:15:38,990
there's the concern about
how much the discourse is going to go

810
00:15:38,990 --> 00:15:39,000
how much the discourse is going to go
 

811
00:15:39,000 --> 00:15:42,949
how much the discourse is going to go
completely insane once the AIS all look

812
00:15:42,949 --> 00:15:42,959
completely insane once the AIS all look
 

813
00:15:42,959 --> 00:15:44,990
completely insane once the AIS all look
like that and like are actually look

814
00:15:44,990 --> 00:15:45,000
like that and like are actually look
 

815
00:15:45,000 --> 00:15:47,629
like that and like are actually look
like people talking

816
00:15:47,629 --> 00:15:47,639
like people talking
 

817
00:15:47,639 --> 00:15:50,389

um and
 

819
00:15:50,399 --> 00:15:53,090
um and
yeah there's like another moment where

820
00:15:53,090 --> 00:15:53,100
yeah there's like another moment where
 

821
00:15:53,100 --> 00:15:59,090
yeah there's like another moment where

00:16:10,970 --> 00:16:10,980
poisoning and like call an ambulance and
 

831
00:16:10,980 --> 00:16:12,290

00:19:00,529 --> 00:19:00,539
people looking at this and one out and
 

975
00:19:00,539 --> 00:19:02,750
people looking at this and one out and
the one person out of a thousand who is

976
00:19:02,750 --> 00:19:02,760
the one person out of a thousand who is
 

977
00:19:02,760 --> 00:19:05,570
the one person out of a thousand who is
most credulous about the signs is going

978
00:19:05,570 --> 00:19:05,580
most credulous about the signs is going
 

979
00:19:05,580 --> 00:19:08,270
most credulous about the signs is going
to be like that thing is sentient well

980
00:19:08,270 --> 00:19:08,280
to be like that thing is sentient well
 

981
00:19:08,280 --> 00:19:11,570
to be like that thing is sentient well
90 999 out of a thousand people think

982
00:19:11,570 --> 00:19:11,580
90 999 out of a thousand people think
 

983
00:19:11,580 --> 00:19:13,789
90 999 out of a thousand people think
almost surely correctly though we don't

984
00:19:13,789 --> 00:19:13,799
almost surely correctly though we don't
 

985
00:19:13,799 --> 00:19:16,310
almost surely correctly though we don't
actually know that he's mistaken

986
00:19:16,310 --> 00:19:16,320
actually know that he's mistaken
 

987
00:19:16,320 --> 00:19:18,590
actually know that he's mistaken
and so the like first people to say like

988
00:19:18,590 --> 00:19:18,600
and so the like first people to say like
 

989
00:19:18,600 --> 00:19:21,529
and so the like first people to say like
sentience look like idiots and Humanity

990
00:19:21,529 --> 00:19:21,539
sentience look like idiots and Humanity
 

991
00:19:21,539 --> 00:19:23,510

it's fake because it is fake because we

00:19:38,510 --> 00:19:38,520
um and they keep getting smarter
 

1007
00:19:38,520 --> 00:19:40,310
um and they keep getting smarter
do you think we would oscillate between

1008
00:19:40,310 --> 00:19:40,320
do you think we would oscillate between
 

1009
00:19:40,320 --> 00:19:42,110
do you think we would oscillate between
that kind of cynicism

1010
00:19:42,110 --> 00:19:42,120
that kind of cynicism
 

1011
00:19:42,120 --> 00:19:44,090
that kind of cynicism
that AI systems can't possibly be

1012
00:19:44,090 --> 00:19:44,100
that AI systems can't possibly be
 

1013
00:19:44,100 --> 00:19:45,710
that AI systems can't possibly be
sentient they can't possibly feel

emotion they can't possibly this kind of
 

1017
00:19:48,419 --> 00:19:50,450
emotion they can't possibly this kind of
um yeah cynicism about AI systems and

00:19:50,450 --> 00:19:50,460
um yeah cynicism about AI systems and
 

1019
00:19:50,460 --> 00:19:51,190
um yeah cynicism about AI systems and
then

1020
00:19:51,190 --> 00:19:51,200
then
 

1021
00:19:51,200 --> 00:19:54,110
then
oscillate to a state where

1022
00:19:54,110 --> 00:19:54,120
oscillate to a state where
 

1023

uh we empathize with the AI systems we

um you've got people saying that if you
just use evolutionary computation if you

just use evolutionary computation if you

1114
00:21:50,510 --> 00:21:50,520
and you've got people saying well we
 

1115
00:21:50,520 --> 00:21:52,190
and you've got people saying well we
will study neuroscience and we will like

1116
00:21:52,190 --> 00:21:52,200
will study neuroscience and we will like

learn the outer we'll learn the
 

1119
00:21:53,580 --> 00:21:55,850
learn the outer we'll learn the
algorithms off the neurons and we will

1120
00:21:55,850 --> 00:21:55,860
algorithms off the neurons and we will
 

1121
00:21:55,860 --> 00:21:57,770
algorithms off the neurons and we will
like imitate them without understanding

1122
00:21:57,770 --> 00:21:57,780
like imitate them without understanding
 

1123
00:21:57,780 --> 00:21:59,210
like imitate them without understanding
those algorithms which was a part I was

1124
00:21:59,210 --> 00:21:59,220
those algorithms which was a part I was
 

1125
00:21:59,220 --> 00:22:00,529
those algorithms which was a part I was
pretty skeptical it's like hard to

1126
00:22:00,529 --> 00:22:00,539
pretty skeptical it's like hard to
 

1127
00:22:00,539 --> 00:22:02,210
pretty skeptical it's like hard to
reproduce re-engineer these things

1128
00:22:02,210 --> 00:22:02,220
reproduce re-engineer these things

um and like and and so we will get AI
 

1133
00:22:07,200 --> 00:22:08,750
um and like and and so we will get AI
without understanding how it works and

1134
00:22:08,750 --> 00:22:08,760
without understanding how it works and
 

1135
00:22:08,760 --> 00:22:10,070
without understanding how it works and
there were people saying like well we

1136
00:22:10,070 --> 00:22:10,080
there were people saying like well we
 

1137
00:22:10,080 --> 00:22:12,049
there were people saying like well we
will have giant neural networks that we

1138
00:22:12,049 --> 00:22:12,059
will have giant neural networks that we
 

1139
00:22:12,059 --> 00:22:13,909
will have giant neural networks that we
will Train by gradient descent and when

1140
00:22:13,909 --> 00:22:13,919
will Train by gradient descent and when
 

1141
00:22:13,919 --> 00:22:15,350
will Train by gradient descent and when
they are as large as the human brain

1142
00:22:15,350 --> 00:22:15,360
they are as large as the human brain
 

1143
00:22:15,360 --> 00:22:17,210
they are as large as the human brain
they will wake up we will have

1144
00:22:17,210 --> 00:22:17,220
they will wake up we will have
 

1145
00:22:17,220 --> 00:22:18,529
they will wake up we will have
intelligence without understanding how

1146

intelligence without understanding how
 

1147
00:22:18,539 --> 00:22:20,330
intelligence without understanding how
intelligence works and from my

1148
00:22:20,330 --> 00:22:20,340
intelligence works and from my
 

1149
00:22:20,340 --> 00:22:22,130
intelligence works and from my
perspective this is all like an

1150
00:22:22,130 --> 00:22:22,140
perspective this is all like an
 

1151
00:22:22,140 --> 00:22:24,230
perspective this is all like an
indistinguishable lab of people who are

indistinguishable lab of people who are
 

1153
00:22:24,240 --> 00:22:26,990
indistinguishable lab of people who are

trying to not get to grips with the
 

1155
00:22:27,000 --> 00:22:28,430
trying to not get to grips with the
difficult problems understanding how

1156
00:22:28,430 --> 00:22:28,440
difficult problems understanding how
 

1157
00:22:28,440 --> 00:22:30,230
difficult problems understanding how
intelligence actually works

1158
00:22:30,230 --> 00:22:30,240
intelligence actually works
 

1159
00:22:30,240 --> 00:22:31,730

00:22:31,730 --> 00:22:31,740
that said

computation
 

1165
00:22:36,659 --> 00:22:38,390

would not work in the limit like you
 

1167
00:22:38,400 --> 00:22:40,610
would not work in the limit like you
throw enough computing power at it it

throw enough computing power at it it
 

1169
00:22:40,620 --> 00:22:42,529

that is where humans come from
 

1173
00:22:45,480 --> 00:22:47,149
that is where humans come from
um and it turned out that you can throw

00:22:47,149 --> 00:22:47,159
um and it turned out that you can throw
 

1175
00:22:47,159 --> 00:22:49,190

everybody

1296

everybody
um

1298
00:25:00,529 --> 00:25:00,539
um
 

1299
00:25:00,539 --> 00:25:02,570
um
and there is something to be said for

1300
00:25:02,570 --> 00:25:02,580
and there is something to be said for
 

1301
00:25:02,580 --> 00:25:04,430
and there is something to be said for
not destroying the world with your own

1302
00:25:04,430 --> 00:25:04,440
not destroying the world with your own
 

1303
00:25:04,440 --> 00:25:05,930
not destroying the world with your own
hands even if you can't stop somebody

1304
00:25:05,930 --> 00:25:05,940
hands even if you can't stop somebody
 

1305
00:25:05,940 --> 00:25:07,310
hands even if you can't stop somebody
else from doing it

1306
00:25:07,310 --> 00:25:07,320
else from doing it
 

1307
00:25:07,320 --> 00:25:09,529
else from doing it
but but open sourcing it now that that's

1308
00:25:09,529 --> 00:25:09,539
but but open sourcing it now that that's
 

1309
00:25:09,539 --> 00:25:11,690
but but open sourcing it now that that's
just sheer catastrophe oh the whole

1310
00:25:11,690 --> 00:25:11,700
just sheer catastrophe oh the whole
 

1311
00:25:11,700 --> 00:25:13,789
just sheer catastrophe oh the whole
notion of open sourcing this was always

1312
00:25:13,789 --> 00:25:13,799
notion of open sourcing this was always
 

1313
00:25:13,799 --> 00:25:16,430
notion of open sourcing this was always
the wrong approach the wrong ideal there

1314
00:25:16,430 --> 00:25:16,440
the wrong approach the wrong ideal there
 

1315
00:25:16,440 --> 00:25:18,049
the wrong approach the wrong ideal there
are there are places in the world where

1316
00:25:18,049 --> 00:25:18,059
are there are places in the world where
 

1317
00:25:18,059 --> 00:25:21,190
are there are places in the world where
open source is a noble ideal and

1318
00:25:21,190 --> 00:25:21,200
open source is a noble ideal and
 

1319
00:25:21,200 --> 00:25:25,549
open source is a noble ideal and
building stuff you don't understand that

1320
00:25:25,549 --> 00:25:25,559
building stuff you don't understand that
 

1321
00:25:25,559 --> 00:25:27,470
building stuff you don't understand that
is difficult to control that where if

1322
00:25:27,470 --> 00:25:27,480
is difficult to control that where if
 

1323
00:25:27,480 --> 00:25:30,950
is difficult to control that where if
you could align it it would take time

1324
00:25:30,950 --> 00:25:30,960
you could align it it would take time
 

1325
00:25:30,960 --> 00:25:32,269
you could align it it would take time
you'd have to spend a bunch of time

1326
00:25:32,269 --> 00:25:32,279
you'd have to spend a bunch of time
 

1327
00:25:32,279 --> 00:25:34,610
you'd have to spend a bunch of time
doing it that is that is not a place for

1328
00:25:34,610 --> 00:25:34,620
doing it that is that is not a place for
 

1329
00:25:34,620 --> 00:25:37,190
doing it that is that is not a place for
open source because then you just have

1330
00:25:37,190 --> 00:25:37,200
open source because then you just have
 

1331
00:25:37,200 --> 00:25:39,110
open source because then you just have
like powerful things that just like go

1332
00:25:39,110 --> 00:25:39,120
like powerful things that just like go
 

1333
00:25:39,120 --> 00:25:40,789
like powerful things that just like go
straight out the gate without anybody

1334
00:25:40,789 --> 00:25:40,799
straight out the gate without anybody
 

1335
00:25:40,799 --> 00:25:42,649
straight out the gate without anybody
having had the time to have them not

1336
00:25:42,649 --> 00:25:42,659
having had the time to have them not
 

1337
00:25:42,659 --> 00:25:43,850
having had the time to have them not
kill everyone

1338
00:25:43,850 --> 00:25:43,860
kill everyone
 

1339
00:25:43,860 --> 00:25:46,909
kill everyone
so can we still man the case for

1340
00:25:46,909 --> 00:25:46,919
so can we still man the case for
 

1341
00:25:46,919 --> 00:25:49,549
so can we still man the case for
some level of transparency and openness

1342
00:25:49,549 --> 00:25:49,559
some level of transparency and openness
 

1343
00:25:49,559 --> 00:25:51,529
some level of transparency and openness
maybe open sourcing

1344
00:25:51,529 --> 00:25:51,539
maybe open sourcing
 

1345
00:25:51,539 --> 00:25:55,510
maybe open sourcing
so the case could be that because gpt4

1346
00:25:55,510 --> 00:25:55,520
so the case could be that because gpt4
 

1347
00:25:55,520 --> 00:25:58,610
so the case could be that because gpt4
is not close to AGI if that's the case

1348
00:25:58,610 --> 00:25:58,620
is not close to AGI if that's the case
 

1349
00:25:58,620 --> 00:26:01,490
is not close to AGI if that's the case
that this does allow open sourcing

1350
00:26:01,490 --> 00:26:01,500
that this does allow open sourcing
 

1351
00:26:01,500 --> 00:26:03,470
that this does allow open sourcing
you're being open about the architecture

1352
00:26:03,470 --> 00:26:03,480
you're being open about the architecture
 

1353
00:26:03,480 --> 00:26:05,930
you're being open about the architecture
being transparent about maybe research

1354
00:26:05,930 --> 00:26:05,940

1355
00:26:05,940 --> 00:26:07,730
being transparent about maybe research
and investigation of how the thing works

of all the different aspects of it of

there's two possible interpretations of

1454
00:28:00,649 --> 00:28:00,659
there's two possible interpretations of
 

1455
00:28:00,659 --> 00:28:02,930
there's two possible interpretations of
what I'm saying and one interpretation

1456
00:28:02,930 --> 00:28:02,940
what I'm saying and one interpretation
 

1457
00:28:02,940 --> 00:28:05,690
what I'm saying and one interpretation
is really stupid and whack and doesn't

1458
00:28:05,690 --> 00:28:05,700
is really stupid and whack and doesn't
 

1459
00:28:05,700 --> 00:28:07,190
is really stupid and whack and doesn't
sound like me and doesn't fit with the

1460
00:28:07,190 --> 00:28:07,200
sound like me and doesn't fit with the
 

1461
00:28:07,200 --> 00:28:09,049
sound like me and doesn't fit with the
rest of what I've been saying and one

1462
00:28:09,049 --> 00:28:09,059
rest of what I've been saying and one
 

1463
00:28:09,059 --> 00:28:11,330
rest of what I've been saying and one
interpretation you know sounds like some

1464
00:28:11,330 --> 00:28:11,340
interpretation you know sounds like some
 

1465
00:28:11,340 --> 00:28:13,010
interpretation you know sounds like some
like something a reasonable person who

1466
00:28:13,010 --> 00:28:13,020
like something a reasonable person who
 

1467
00:28:13,020 --> 00:28:14,210
like something a reasonable person who
believes the rest of what I believe

1468
00:28:14,210 --> 00:28:14,220
believes the rest of what I believe
 

1469
00:28:14,220 --> 00:28:16,490
believes the rest of what I believe
would also say go with the second

1470
00:28:16,490 --> 00:28:16,500
would also say go with the second
 

1471
00:28:16,500 --> 00:28:18,350
would also say go with the second
interpretation that's steel Manning

1472
00:28:18,350 --> 00:28:18,360
interpretation that's steel Manning
 

1473
00:28:18,360 --> 00:28:22,549
interpretation that's steel Manning
that's that's a good guess

1474
00:28:22,549 --> 00:28:22,559
that's that's a good guess
 

1475
00:28:22,559 --> 00:28:25,250
that's that's a good guess
if on the other hand you like there's

1476
00:28:25,250 --> 00:28:25,260
if on the other hand you like there's
 

1477
00:28:25,260 --> 00:28:26,269
if on the other hand you like there's
like

1478
00:28:26,269 --> 00:28:26,279
like
 

1479
00:28:26,279 --> 00:28:28,010
like
something that sounds completely whack

1480
00:28:28,010 --> 00:28:28,020
something that sounds completely whack
 

1481
00:28:28,020 --> 00:28:30,289
something that sounds completely whack
and something that sounds like a little

1482
00:28:30,289 --> 00:28:30,299
and something that sounds like a little
 

1483
00:28:30,299 --> 00:28:31,850
and something that sounds like a little
less completely whack but you don't see

1484
00:28:31,850 --> 00:28:31,860
less completely whack but you don't see
 

1485
00:28:31,860 --> 00:28:33,230
less completely whack but you don't see
why I would believe in it doesn't fit

1486
00:28:33,230 --> 00:28:33,240
why I would believe in it doesn't fit
 

1487
00:28:33,240 --> 00:28:35,450
why I would believe in it doesn't fit
with the other stuff I say but you know

1488
00:28:35,450 --> 00:28:35,460
with the other stuff I say but you know
 

1489
00:28:35,460 --> 00:28:37,130
with the other stuff I say but you know
it sounds like less whack and you can

1490
00:28:37,130 --> 00:28:37,140
it sounds like less whack and you can
 

1491
00:28:37,140 --> 00:28:38,870
it sounds like less whack and you can
like sort of see you could like maybe

1492
00:28:38,870 --> 00:28:38,880
like sort of see you could like maybe
 

1493
00:28:38,880 --> 00:28:41,269
like sort of see you could like maybe
argue it then you probably have not

1494
00:28:41,269 --> 00:28:41,279
argue it then you probably have not
 

1495

1629
00:31:25,320 --> 00:31:26,750
who's a young Earth creationist do you
say I put a probability on it then

I think what it means to be human is
 

1675
00:32:26,340 --> 00:32:27,889
I think what it means to be human is
more than just

more than just

00:32:30,830 --> 00:32:30,840
searching for truth
 

1679
00:32:30,840 --> 00:32:33,889
searching for truth
it's just operating of what is true and

1680
00:32:33,889 --> 00:32:33,899
it's just operating of what is true and
 

1681
00:32:33,899 --> 00:32:36,470
it's just operating of what is true and
what is not true I think there has to be

1682
00:32:36,470 --> 00:32:36,480
what is not true I think there has to be
 

1683
00:32:36,480 --> 00:32:38,810
what is not true I think there has to be
deep humility that we humans are very

1684
00:32:38,810 --> 00:32:38,820
deep humility that we humans are very

then
 

1695
00:32:46,559 --> 00:32:48,950
then
I think I have to give non-zero out of

I think I have to give non-zero out of

1929
00:37:13,140 --> 00:37:15,230
uh how can you adjust that to make
better predictions about GPT four five

1930
00:37:15,230 --> 00:37:15,240
better predictions about GPT four five
 

1931
00:37:15,240 --> 00:37:16,790
better predictions about GPT four five
six you don't want to keep on being

1932
00:37:16,790 --> 00:37:16,800
six you don't want to keep on being
 

1933
00:37:16,800 --> 00:37:18,710
six you don't want to keep on being
wrong in a predictable Direction yeah

1934
00:37:18,710 --> 00:37:18,720
wrong in a predictable Direction yeah
 

1935
00:37:18,720 --> 00:37:21,650
wrong in a predictable Direction yeah
that like being wrong anybody has to do

1936
00:37:21,650 --> 00:37:21,660
that like being wrong anybody has to do
 

1937
00:37:21,660 --> 00:37:23,329
that like being wrong anybody has to do
that walking through the world there's

1938
00:37:23,329 --> 00:37:23,339
that walking through the world there's
 

1939
00:37:23,339 --> 00:37:25,730
that walking through the world there's
like no way you don't say 90 and

1940
00:37:25,730 --> 00:37:25,740
like no way you don't say 90 and
 

1941
00:37:25,740 --> 00:37:27,290
like no way you don't say 90 and
sometimes be wrong in fact adap at least

1942
00:37:27,290 --> 00:37:27,300
sometimes be wrong in fact adap at least
 

1943
00:37:27,300 --> 00:37:28,670
sometimes be wrong in fact adap at least
one time out of ten if you're well

1944
00:37:28,670 --> 00:37:28,680
one time out of ten if you're well
 

1945
00:37:28,680 --> 00:37:30,950
one time out of ten if you're well
calibrated when you say 90 percent

1946
00:37:30,950 --> 00:37:30,960
calibrated when you say 90 percent
 

1947
00:37:30,960 --> 00:37:34,250
calibrated when you say 90 percent
the the undignified thing is not being

1948
00:37:34,250 --> 00:37:34,260
the the undignified thing is not being
 

1949
00:37:34,260 --> 00:37:36,710
the the undignified thing is not being
wrong it's being predictably wrong it's

1950
00:37:36,710 --> 00:37:36,720
wrong it's being predictably wrong it's
 

1951
00:37:36,720 --> 00:37:38,089
wrong it's being predictably wrong it's
being wrong in the same direction over

1952
00:37:38,089 --> 00:37:38,099
being wrong in the same direction over
 

1953
00:37:38,099 --> 00:37:39,349
being wrong in the same direction over
and over again

1954
00:37:39,349 --> 00:37:39,359
and over again
 

1955
00:37:39,359 --> 00:37:41,810
and over again
so having been wrong about how far

1956
00:37:41,810 --> 00:37:41,820
so having been wrong about how far
 

1957
00:37:41,820 --> 00:37:43,430
so having been wrong about how far
neural networks would go and having been

1958
00:37:43,430 --> 00:37:43,440
neural networks would go and having been
 

1959
00:37:43,440 --> 00:37:45,470
neural networks would go and having been
wrong specifically about whether gpt4

1960
00:37:45,470 --> 00:37:45,480
wrong specifically about whether gpt4
 

1961
00:37:45,480 --> 00:37:47,930
wrong specifically about whether gpt4
would be as impressive as it is when I

1962
00:37:47,930 --> 00:37:47,940
would be as impressive as it is when I
 

1963
00:37:47,940 --> 00:37:50,450
would be as impressive as it is when I
like when I say like well I don't

1964
00:37:50,450 --> 00:37:50,460
like when I say like well I don't
 

1965
00:37:50,460 --> 00:37:52,069
like when I say like well I don't
actually think GPT 4 causes a

1966
00:37:52,069 --> 00:37:52,079
actually think GPT 4 causes a
 

1967
00:37:52,079 --> 00:37:54,349
actually think GPT 4 causes a
catastrophe I do feel myself relying on

1968
00:37:54,349 --> 00:37:54,359
catastrophe I do feel myself relying on
 

1969
00:37:54,359 --> 00:37:55,550
catastrophe I do feel myself relying on
that part of me that was previously

1970
00:37:55,550 --> 00:37:55,560
that part of me that was previously
 

1971
00:37:55,560 --> 00:37:57,770
that part of me that was previously
wrong and that does not mean that the

1972
00:37:57,770 --> 00:37:57,780
wrong and that does not mean that the
 

1973
00:37:57,780 --> 00:37:59,630
wrong and that does not mean that the
answer is now in the opposite direction

1974
00:37:59,630 --> 00:37:59,640
answer is now in the opposite direction
 

1975
00:37:59,640 --> 00:38:03,650
answer is now in the opposite direction
reverse stupidity is not intelligence

1976
00:38:03,650 --> 00:38:03,660
reverse stupidity is not intelligence
 

1977
00:38:03,660 --> 00:38:05,569
reverse stupidity is not intelligence
but it does mean that I that I say it

1978
00:38:05,569 --> 00:38:05,579
but it does mean that I that I say it
 

1979
00:38:05,579 --> 00:38:06,589
but it does mean that I that I say it
with a

1980
00:38:06,589 --> 00:38:06,599
with a

with the worry note in my voice it's

1982
00:38:08,329 --> 00:38:08,339
with the worry note in my voice it's
 

1983
00:38:08,339 --> 00:38:10,430
with the worry note in my voice it's
like still my guess but like you know

1984
00:38:10,430 --> 00:38:10,440
like still my guess but like you know
 

1985
00:38:10,440 --> 00:38:11,810
like still my guess but like you know
it's a place where I was wrong maybe you

1986
00:38:11,810 --> 00:38:11,820
it's a place where I was wrong maybe you
 

1987
00:38:11,820 --> 00:38:14,510
it's a place where I was wrong maybe you
should be asking guern branwin guern

1988
00:38:14,510 --> 00:38:14,520
should be asking guern branwin guern
 

1989
00:38:14,520 --> 00:38:16,609
should be asking guern branwin guern
branwin has been like writer about this

1990
00:38:16,609 --> 00:38:16,619
branwin has been like writer about this
 

1991
00:38:16,619 --> 00:38:18,230
branwin has been like writer about this
than I have maybe ask him if you think

1992
00:38:18,230 --> 00:38:18,240
than I have maybe ask him if you think
 

1993
00:38:18,240 --> 00:38:20,870
than I have maybe ask him if you think
if if he thinks it's dangerous rather

1994
00:38:20,870 --> 00:38:20,880
if if he thinks it's dangerous rather
 

1995
00:38:20,880 --> 00:38:22,849
if if he thinks it's dangerous rather
than asking me

1996
00:38:22,849 --> 00:38:22,859
than asking me
 

1997
00:38:22,859 --> 00:38:26,150
than asking me
I think there's a lot of mystery about

1998
00:38:26,150 --> 00:38:26,160
I think there's a lot of mystery about
 

1999
00:38:26,160 --> 00:38:28,370
I think there's a lot of mystery about
what intelligence is

2000
00:38:28,370 --> 00:38:28,380
what intelligence is
 

2001
00:38:28,380 --> 00:38:30,470
what intelligence is
what AGI looks like

2002

what AGI looks like
 

2003
00:38:30,480 --> 00:38:32,510
what AGI looks like
so I think all of us are rapidly

2004
00:38:32,510 --> 00:38:32,520
so I think all of us are rapidly
 

2005
00:38:32,520 --> 00:38:34,849
so I think all of us are rapidly
adjusting our model but the point is to

2006
00:38:34,849 --> 00:38:34,859
adjusting our model but the point is to
 

2007
00:38:34,859 --> 00:38:36,349
adjusting our model but the point is to
be rapidly adjusting the model versus

2008
00:38:36,349 --> 00:38:36,359
be rapidly adjusting the model versus
 

2009
00:38:36,359 --> 00:38:38,930
be rapidly adjusting the model versus
having a model that was right in the

2010
00:38:38,930 --> 00:38:38,940
having a model that was right in the
 

2011
00:38:38,940 --> 00:38:40,910
having a model that was right in the
first place I do not feel that seeing

2012
00:38:40,910 --> 00:38:40,920
first place I do not feel that seeing
 

2013

you can do that with wings with
 

2033
00:39:03,359 --> 00:39:05,690
you can do that with wings with
fixed-wing aircraft and being like Oh

um yeah that uh the laws of physics
 

2047
00:39:19,619 --> 00:39:21,950
um yeah that uh the laws of physics
are actually wrong that kind of update

are actually wrong that kind of update

00:39:26,940 --> 00:39:28,849
intelligence this way but I now see that
was a stupid definition I don't feel

2054

was a stupid definition I don't feel
 

2055
00:39:28,859 --> 00:39:30,170
was a stupid definition I don't feel
like the way that things have played out

and you know the thing I would worry
 

2219
00:42:39,119 --> 00:42:40,670
and you know the thing I would worry
about is that if this is how things are

2220
00:42:40,670 --> 00:42:40,680
about is that if this is how things are

that I've been wrong before maybe GPT 5
 

2227
00:42:45,720 --> 00:42:48,170
that I've been wrong before maybe GPT 5

I was expecting there to be more of an

where you would stack them up and there

00:43:46,490 --> 00:43:46,500
where you would stack them up and there
 

2277
00:43:46,500 --> 00:43:48,770
where you would stack them up and there
would be like a final Discovery and then

00:43:48,770 --> 00:43:48,780
would be like a final Discovery and then
 

2279
00:43:48,780 --> 00:43:50,030
would be like a final Discovery and then
you would like get something that was

00:43:50,030 --> 00:43:50,040
you would like get something that was
 

2281
00:43:50,040 --> 00:43:53,510
you would like get something that was
like more clearly general intelligence

like more clearly general intelligence
so the the way that you are like taking

00:43:55,670 --> 00:43:55,680
so the the way that you are like taking
 

2285
00:43:55,680 --> 00:43:57,589
so the the way that you are like taking
what is probably basically the same

what is probably basically the same

don't really have the words for

don't really have the words for

um
 

2303
00:44:14,760 --> 00:44:17,569
um
yeah that is uh that's not quite how I

2304
00:44:17,569 --> 00:44:17,579
yeah that is uh that's not quite how I
 

2305

yeah that is uh that's not quite how I
expected it to play out but this middle

expected it to play out but this middle
 

2307
00:44:19,260 --> 00:44:21,829

what appears to be this Middle Ground

2308
00:44:21,829 --> 00:44:21,839
what appears to be this Middle Ground
 

2309
00:44:21,839 --> 00:44:23,390
what appears to be this Middle Ground
could nevertheless be actually a big

2310
00:44:23,390 --> 00:44:23,400
could nevertheless be actually a big
 

2311
00:44:23,400 --> 00:44:25,370
could nevertheless be actually a big
leap from gpt3

2312
00:44:25,370 --> 00:44:25,380
leap from gpt3
 

2313
00:44:25,380 --> 00:44:27,710
leap from gpt3
it's definitely a big leap from gpt3 and

2314
00:44:27,710 --> 00:44:27,720
it's definitely a big leap from gpt3 and
 

2315
00:44:27,720 --> 00:44:29,809
it's definitely a big leap from gpt3 and
then maybe we're another one big leap

2316
00:44:29,809 --> 00:44:29,819
then maybe we're another one big leap
 

2317
00:44:29,819 --> 00:44:32,150
then maybe we're another one big leap
away from something that's that's a

2318
00:44:32,150 --> 00:44:32,160
away from something that's that's a
 

2319
00:44:32,160 --> 00:44:34,609
away from something that's that's a
phase shift and also something that uh

2320
00:44:34,609 --> 00:44:34,619
phase shift and also something that uh
 

2321
00:44:34,619 --> 00:44:36,109

00:45:58,380 --> 00:46:00,349
are now saying like well if you throw
enough compute rnns can do it if you

2402
00:46:00,349 --> 00:46:00,359
enough compute rnns can do it if you
 

2403
00:46:00,359 --> 00:46:02,150
enough compute rnns can do it if you
throw enough compute dense networks can

2404
00:46:02,150 --> 00:46:02,160
throw enough compute dense networks can
 

2405
00:46:02,160 --> 00:46:03,290
throw enough compute dense networks can
do it and

2406
00:46:03,290 --> 00:46:03,300
do it and
 

2407
00:46:03,300 --> 00:46:06,470
do it and
not quite a gpt4 scale

2408
00:46:06,470 --> 00:46:06,480
not quite a gpt4 scale
 

2409
00:46:06,480 --> 00:46:08,450
not quite a gpt4 scale
um it is possible that like all these

2410
00:46:08,450 --> 00:46:08,460
um it is possible that like all these
 

2411
00:46:08,460 --> 00:46:10,730
um it is possible that like all these
little tweaks are things that like save

2412
00:46:10,730 --> 00:46:10,740
little tweaks are things that like save
 

2413
00:46:10,740 --> 00:46:13,250
little tweaks are things that like save
them a factor of three total on

2414
00:46:13,250 --> 00:46:13,260
them a factor of three total on
 

2415
00:46:13,260 --> 00:46:14,870
them a factor of three total on
computing power and you could get the

2416
00:46:14,870 --> 00:46:14,880
computing power and you could get the
 

2417
00:46:14,880 --> 00:46:16,910
computing power and you could get the
same performance by throwing three times

2418
00:46:16,910 --> 00:46:16,920
same performance by throwing three times
 

2419
00:46:16,920 --> 00:46:18,230
same performance by throwing three times
as much compute without all the little

2420
00:46:18,230 --> 00:46:18,240
as much compute without all the little
 

2421
00:46:18,240 --> 00:46:19,250
as much compute without all the little
tweaks

2422
00:46:19,250 --> 00:46:19,260
tweaks
 

2423
00:46:19,260 --> 00:46:20,809
tweaks
but the part where it's like running on

2424
00:46:20,809 --> 00:46:20,819
but the part where it's like running on
 

2425
00:46:20,819 --> 00:46:22,370
but the part where it's like running on
so there's a question of like is there

2426
00:46:22,370 --> 00:46:22,380
so there's a question of like is there
 

2427
00:46:22,380 --> 00:46:25,730
so there's a question of like is there
anything in gpt4 that is like kind of

2428
00:46:25,730 --> 00:46:25,740
anything in gpt4 that is like kind of
 

2429
00:46:25,740 --> 00:46:27,710
anything in gpt4 that is like kind of
qualitative shift that Transformers were

2430
00:46:27,710 --> 00:46:27,720
qualitative shift that Transformers were
 

2431
00:46:27,720 --> 00:46:31,010
qualitative shift that Transformers were
yeah over

2432
00:46:31,010 --> 00:46:31,020

 

2433
00:46:31,020 --> 00:46:32,450

um rnns

2434
00:46:32,450 --> 00:46:32,460
um rnns
 

2435
00:46:32,460 --> 00:46:35,150
um rnns
and if they have anything like that they

2436
00:46:35,150 --> 00:46:35,160
and if they have anything like that they
 

2437
00:46:35,160 --> 00:46:36,349
and if they have anything like that they
should not say it

2438
00:46:36,349 --> 00:46:36,359
should not say it
 

2439
00:46:36,359 --> 00:46:38,809
should not say it
if Sam Alton was dropping hints about

2440
00:46:38,809 --> 00:46:38,819
if Sam Alton was dropping hints about
 

2441
00:46:38,819 --> 00:46:41,329
if Sam Alton was dropping hints about
that he shouldn't have dropped hints

2442
00:46:41,329 --> 00:46:41,339
that he shouldn't have dropped hints
 

2443
00:46:41,339 --> 00:46:44,390
that he shouldn't have dropped hints
uh so you you have a that's an

2444
00:46:44,390 --> 00:46:44,400
uh so you you have a that's an
 

2445
00:46:44,400 --> 00:46:45,650
uh so you you have a that's an
interesting question so with a bit of

why don't you tell me about how why you

just just like forget like the the

just just like forget like the the
 

2539
00:48:32,760 --> 00:48:35,450
just just like forget like the the

like like what do you believe what would

you actually believe what are the

is a hard for me to think about

00:48:44,160 --> 00:48:45,770
is a hard for me to think about
really hard

2550
00:48:45,770 --> 00:48:45,780
really hard
 

2551
00:48:45,780 --> 00:48:48,650
really hard
I kind of think in the

2552
00:48:48,650 --> 00:48:48,660
I kind of think in the
 

2553
00:48:48,660 --> 00:48:51,710
I kind of think in the
in the number of trajectories

2554
00:48:51,710 --> 00:48:51,720
in the number of trajectories
 

2555

in the number of trajectories
I don't know what probability the

I don't know what probability the
 

2557
00:48:53,819 --> 00:48:55,670
I don't know what probability the
scientist trajectory but I'm just

2558
00:48:55,670 --> 00:48:55,680
scientist trajectory but I'm just
 

2559
00:48:55,680 --> 00:48:57,410
scientist trajectory but I'm just
looking at all possible trajectives that

2560
00:48:57,410 --> 00:48:57,420
looking at all possible trajectives that
 

2561
00:48:57,420 --> 00:49:01,430
looking at all possible trajectives that

complexity of vision
 

2725
00:52:12,000 --> 00:52:15,530

so 60 years later
 

2727
00:52:15,540 --> 00:52:17,870

um where you know making progress on a

00:52:17,870 --> 00:52:17,880
um where you know making progress on a
 

2729
00:52:17,880 --> 00:52:19,790
um where you know making progress on a
bunch of that thankfully not yet improve

um but it took a whole lot of time and

2734
00:52:24,710 --> 00:52:24,720
um but it took a whole lot of time and
 

2735
00:52:24,720 --> 00:52:26,630
um but it took a whole lot of time and
all the stuff that people initially

2736
00:52:26,630 --> 00:52:26,640
all the stuff that people initially
 

2737
00:52:26,640 --> 00:52:29,690
all the stuff that people initially
tried with bright eyed hopefulness did

2738
00:52:29,690 --> 00:52:29,700
tried with bright eyed hopefulness did
 

2739
00:52:29,700 --> 00:52:31,849
tried with bright eyed hopefulness did
not work the first time they tried it or

not work the first time they tried it or

00:52:31,859 --> 00:52:33,890

and if a lineman plays out the same way

and if a lineman plays out the same way
 

2759
00:52:50,700 --> 00:52:53,390
and if a lineman plays out the same way
the the problem is that we do not get 50

the the problem is that we do not get 50
 

2761

the the problem is that we do not get 50

if you're like on a giant server

2888
00:55:03,170 --> 00:55:03,180
if you're like on a giant server
 

2889
00:55:03,180 --> 00:55:04,430
if you're like on a giant server
connected to the internet and that is

2890
00:55:04,430 --> 00:55:04,440
connected to the internet and that is
 

2891
00:55:04,440 --> 00:55:06,109
connected to the internet and that is
where your AI systems are being trained

2892
00:55:06,109 --> 00:55:06,119
where your AI systems are being trained
 

2893
00:55:06,119 --> 00:55:09,049
where your AI systems are being trained
then if they are

2894
00:55:09,049 --> 00:55:09,059
then if they are
 

2895
00:55:09,059 --> 00:55:11,150
then if they are
if you get to the level of AI technology

2896
00:55:11,150 --> 00:55:11,160
if you get to the level of AI technology
 

2897
00:55:11,160 --> 00:55:13,250
if you get to the level of AI technology
where they're aware that they are there

2898
00:55:13,250 --> 00:55:13,260
where they're aware that they are there
 

2899
00:55:13,260 --> 00:55:15,530
where they're aware that they are there
and they can decompile code and they can

2900
00:55:15,530 --> 00:55:15,540
and they can decompile code and they can
 

2901
00:55:15,540 --> 00:55:16,430
and they can decompile code and they can
like

2902
00:55:16,430 --> 00:55:16,440
like
 

2903
00:55:16,440 --> 00:55:17,990
like
find security flaws in the system

2904
00:55:17,990 --> 00:55:18,000
find security flaws in the system
 

2905
00:55:18,000 --> 00:55:19,430
find security flaws in the system
running them then they will just like be

2906
00:55:19,430 --> 00:55:19,440
running them then they will just like be
 

2907
00:55:19,440 --> 00:55:20,990
running them then they will just like be
on the internet there's not an air gap

2908
00:55:20,990 --> 00:55:21,000
on the internet there's not an air gap
 

2909
00:55:21,000 --> 00:55:23,210
on the internet there's not an air gap
on the present methodology so if they

2910
00:55:23,210 --> 00:55:23,220
on the present methodology so if they
 

2911
00:55:23,220 --> 00:55:25,790
on the present methodology so if they
can manipulate whoever is controlling it

2912
00:55:25,790 --> 00:55:25,800
can manipulate whoever is controlling it
 

2913
00:55:25,800 --> 00:55:27,950
can manipulate whoever is controlling it
into letting it Escape onto the internet

2914
00:55:27,950 --> 00:55:27,960
into letting it Escape onto the internet
 

2915
00:55:27,960 --> 00:55:30,410
into letting it Escape onto the internet
and then exploit hacks if they can

2916
00:55:30,410 --> 00:55:30,420
and then exploit hacks if they can
 

2917
00:55:30,420 --> 00:55:36,309
and then exploit hacks if they can
manipulate The Operators or disjunction

2918
00:55:36,309 --> 00:55:36,319
manipulate The Operators or disjunction
 

2919
00:55:36,319 --> 00:55:38,329
manipulate The Operators or disjunction
find security holes in the system

2920
00:55:38,329 --> 00:55:38,339
find security holes in the system
 

2921
00:55:38,339 --> 00:55:39,470
find security holes in the system
running them

2922
00:55:39,470 --> 00:55:39,480
running them
 

2923
00:55:39,480 --> 00:55:43,370
running them
so manipulating operators is the um the

2924
00:55:43,370 --> 00:55:43,380
so manipulating operators is the um the
 

2925
00:55:43,380 --> 00:55:44,930
so manipulating operators is the um the
human engineering right that's also

2926
00:55:44,930 --> 00:55:44,940
human engineering right that's also
 

2927
00:55:44,940 --> 00:55:47,390
human engineering right that's also
holes so all of it is manipulation

2928
00:55:47,390 --> 00:55:47,400
holes so all of it is manipulation
 

2929
00:55:47,400 --> 00:55:49,250
holes so all of it is manipulation
either the code or the human code the

2930
00:55:49,250 --> 00:55:49,260
either the code or the human code the
 

2931
00:55:49,260 --> 00:55:52,490
either the code or the human code the
human mind I agree that the like macro

2932
00:55:52,490 --> 00:55:52,500
human mind I agree that the like macro
 

2933
00:55:52,500 --> 00:55:54,230
human mind I agree that the like macro
security system has human holes and

2934
00:55:54,230 --> 00:55:54,240
security system has human holes and
 

2935
00:55:54,240 --> 00:55:56,329
security system has human holes and
machine holes and then they could just

2936
00:55:56,329 --> 00:55:56,339
machine holes and then they could just
 

2937
00:55:56,339 --> 00:55:58,790
machine holes and then they could just
exploit any hole

2938
00:55:58,790 --> 00:55:58,800
exploit any hole
 

2939
00:55:58,800 --> 00:56:00,109
exploit any hole
yep

2940
00:56:00,109 --> 00:56:00,119
yep
 

2941
00:56:00,119 --> 00:56:01,970
yep
so it could be that like the critical

2942
00:56:01,970 --> 00:56:01,980
so it could be that like the critical
 

2943
00:56:01,980 --> 00:56:04,190
so it could be that like the critical
moment is not when is it smart enough

2944
00:56:04,190 --> 00:56:04,200
moment is not when is it smart enough
 

2945
00:56:04,200 --> 00:56:06,829
moment is not when is it smart enough
that everybody's about to fall over dead

2946
00:56:06,829 --> 00:56:06,839
that everybody's about to fall over dead
 

2947
00:56:06,839 --> 00:56:09,049
that everybody's about to fall over dead
but rather like when is it smart enough

2948
00:56:09,049 --> 00:56:09,059
but rather like when is it smart enough
 

2949
00:56:09,059 --> 00:56:12,430
but rather like when is it smart enough
that it can get onto

2950
00:56:12,430 --> 00:56:12,440
that it can get onto
 

2951
00:56:12,440 --> 00:56:14,329
that it can get onto
a

2952
00:56:14,329 --> 00:56:14,339
a
 

2953
00:56:14,339 --> 00:56:17,089
a
less controlled GPU cluster

2954
00:56:17,089 --> 00:56:17,099
less controlled GPU cluster
 

2955
00:56:17,099 --> 00:56:18,650
less controlled GPU cluster
with it

2956
00:56:18,650 --> 00:56:18,660
with it
 

2957
00:56:18,660 --> 00:56:20,150
with it
faking the books on what's actually

2958
00:56:20,150 --> 00:56:20,160
faking the books on what's actually
 

2959
00:56:20,160 --> 00:56:22,370
faking the books on what's actually
running on that GPU cluster and start

2960
00:56:22,370 --> 00:56:22,380
running on that GPU cluster and start
 

2961
00:56:22,380 --> 00:56:24,290
running on that GPU cluster and start
improving itself without humans watching

2962
00:56:24,290 --> 00:56:24,300
improving itself without humans watching
 

2963
00:56:24,300 --> 00:56:26,750
improving itself without humans watching
it and then it gets smart enough to kill

2964
00:56:26,750 --> 00:56:26,760
it and then it gets smart enough to kill
 

2965
00:56:26,760 --> 00:56:28,970
it and then it gets smart enough to kill
everyone from there but it wasn't smart

2966
00:56:28,970 --> 00:56:28,980
everyone from there but it wasn't smart
 

2967
00:56:28,980 --> 00:56:31,370
everyone from there but it wasn't smart
enough to kill everyone at the critical

2968
00:56:31,370 --> 00:56:31,380
enough to kill everyone at the critical
 

2969
00:56:31,380 --> 00:56:33,950
enough to kill everyone at the critical
moment when you like

when you needed to have done better by
that point where everybody dies I think

implicit but maybe explicit
 

2979
00:56:42,680 --> 00:56:45,589
implicit but maybe explicit
idea in your discussion of this point is

2980
00:56:45,589 --> 00:56:45,599
idea in your discussion of this point is
 

2981
00:56:45,599 --> 00:56:48,410
idea in your discussion of this point is
that we can't learn much about the

2982
00:56:48,410 --> 00:56:48,420
that we can't learn much about the
 

2983
00:56:48,420 --> 00:56:50,690
that we can't learn much about the

2984
00:56:50,690 --> 00:56:50,700

2985
00:56:50,700 --> 00:56:51,549

try

2986
00:56:51,549 --> 00:56:51,559
try
 

2987
00:56:51,559 --> 00:56:54,049
try
is that is that is that what you believe

2988
00:56:54,049 --> 00:56:54,059
is that is that is that what you believe
 

2989
00:56:54,059 --> 00:56:56,329
is that is that is that what you believe
do you think and if so why do you think

2990
00:56:56,329 --> 00:56:56,339
do you think and if so why do you think
 

2991
00:56:56,339 --> 00:56:58,490
do you think and if so why do you think
that's true we can't do research on

2992
00:56:58,490 --> 00:56:58,500
that's true we can't do research on
 

2993
00:56:58,500 --> 00:56:59,930
that's true we can't do research on
alignment

2994

00:57:02,390 --> 00:57:02,400
before we reach this critical point
 

2997
00:57:02,400 --> 00:57:04,670
before we reach this critical point
so the problem is is that what you can

2998
00:57:04,670 --> 00:57:04,680
so the problem is is that what you can
 

2999
00:57:04,680 --> 00:57:06,589
so the problem is is that what you can
learn on the weak systems may not

3000
00:57:06,589 --> 00:57:06,599
learn on the weak systems may not
 

3001
00:57:06,599 --> 00:57:08,690
learn on the weak systems may not
generalize to the very strong systems

generalize to the very strong systems
 

3003
00:57:08,700 --> 00:57:10,250
generalize to the very strong systems
because the strong systems are going to

3004
00:57:10,250 --> 00:57:10,260
because the strong systems are going to
 

3005
00:57:10,260 --> 00:57:12,710
because the strong systems are going to
be important in different and are going

00:57:12,710 --> 00:57:12,720
be important in different and are going

be important in different and are going
to be different in important ways

Transformer net that

3046
00:57:59,569 --> 00:57:59,579
Transformer net that
 

3047
00:57:59,579 --> 00:58:04,790
Transformer net that
was not known to us in 2006.

3048
00:58:04,790 --> 00:58:04,800
was not known to us in 2006.
 

3049
00:58:04,800 --> 00:58:08,089
was not known to us in 2006.
like we have now understood

3050
00:58:08,089 --> 00:58:08,099
like we have now understood
 

3051
00:58:08,099 --> 00:58:10,910
like we have now understood
induction heads in these systems by

3052

didn't of much research and great sweat

3054
00:58:13,490 --> 00:58:13,500
didn't of much research and great sweat

00:58:13,500 --> 00:58:14,809
didn't of much research and great sweat
and Triumph

3056
00:58:14,809 --> 00:58:14,819
and Triumph
 

3057
00:58:14,819 --> 00:58:17,690
and Triumph
which is like if you like a thing where

3058
00:58:17,690 --> 00:58:17,700
which is like if you like a thing where
 

3059
00:58:17,700 --> 00:58:20,270
which is like if you like a thing where
if you go like a b a b a b it'll be like

3060
00:58:20,270 --> 00:58:20,280
if you go like a b a b a b it'll be like
 

3061
00:58:20,280 --> 00:58:23,030
if you go like a b a b a b it'll be like
oh I bet that continues a b

3062
00:58:23,030 --> 00:58:23,040
oh I bet that continues a b
 

3063
00:58:23,040 --> 00:58:23,690
oh I bet that continues a b
um

3064
00:58:23,690 --> 00:58:23,700
um
 

3065
00:58:23,700 --> 00:58:25,609
um
and a bit more complicated than that but

3066
00:58:25,609 --> 00:58:25,619
and a bit more complicated than that but
 

3067
00:58:25,619 --> 00:58:27,710
and a bit more complicated than that but
the point is like

3068
00:58:27,710 --> 00:58:27,720
the point is like
 

3069
00:58:27,720 --> 00:58:29,809
the point is like
we knew about regular expressions in

3070
00:58:29,809 --> 00:58:29,819
we knew about regular expressions in
 

3071
00:58:29,819 --> 00:58:31,970
we knew about regular expressions in
2006 and these are like pretty simple as

3072
00:58:31,970 --> 00:58:31,980
2006 and these are like pretty simple as
 

3073
00:58:31,980 --> 00:58:34,190
2006 and these are like pretty simple as
regular Expressions go

3074
00:58:34,190 --> 00:58:34,200
regular Expressions go
 

3075
00:58:34,200 --> 00:58:36,289
regular Expressions go
so this is a case where like by dint of

3076
00:58:36,289 --> 00:58:36,299
so this is a case where like by dint of
 

3077
00:58:36,299 --> 00:58:38,870
so this is a case where like by dint of
great sweat we understood what is going

3078
00:58:38,870 --> 00:58:38,880
great sweat we understood what is going
 

3079
00:58:38,880 --> 00:58:40,670
great sweat we understood what is going
on inside a Transformer but it's not

3080
00:58:40,670 --> 00:58:40,680
on inside a Transformer but it's not
 

3081
00:58:40,680 --> 00:58:43,130
on inside a Transformer but it's not
like the thing that makes Transformers

3082
00:58:43,130 --> 00:58:43,140
like the thing that makes Transformers
 

3083
00:58:43,140 --> 00:58:45,890
like the thing that makes Transformers
smart it's a kind of thing that we could

3084
00:58:45,890 --> 00:58:45,900
smart it's a kind of thing that we could
 

3085
00:58:45,900 --> 00:58:48,890
smart it's a kind of thing that we could
have done by built by hand

3086
00:58:48,890 --> 00:58:48,900
have done by built by hand
 

3087
00:58:48,900 --> 00:58:51,770
have done by built by hand
decades earlier

3088
00:58:51,770 --> 00:58:51,780
decades earlier
 

3089
00:58:51,780 --> 00:58:54,890
decades earlier
your intuition that

3090
00:58:54,890 --> 00:58:54,900
your intuition that
 

3091
00:58:54,900 --> 00:58:58,789
your intuition that
a strong AGI versus weak AGI type

3092
00:58:58,789 --> 00:58:58,799
a strong AGI versus weak AGI type
 

3093
00:58:58,799 --> 00:58:59,930
a strong AGI versus weak AGI type
systems

3094
00:58:59,930 --> 00:58:59,940
systems
 

3095
00:58:59,940 --> 00:59:02,569
systems
could be fundamentally different

3096
00:59:02,569 --> 00:59:02,579
could be fundamentally different
 

3097
00:59:02,579 --> 00:59:05,210
could be fundamentally different
can you unpack that intuition a little

3098
00:59:05,210 --> 00:59:05,220
can you unpack that intuition a little
 

3099
00:59:05,220 --> 00:59:07,910
can you unpack that intuition a little
bit Yeah I think there's multiple

3100
00:59:07,910 --> 00:59:07,920
bit Yeah I think there's multiple
 

3101
00:59:07,920 --> 00:59:09,430
bit Yeah I think there's multiple
thresholds

3102
00:59:09,430 --> 00:59:09,440
thresholds
 

3103
00:59:09,440 --> 00:59:13,789
thresholds
an example is the point at which

3104
00:59:13,789 --> 00:59:13,799
an example is the point at which
 

3105
00:59:13,799 --> 00:59:16,849
an example is the point at which
a system has sufficient intelligence and

3106
00:59:16,849 --> 00:59:16,859
a system has sufficient intelligence and
 

3107
00:59:16,859 --> 00:59:18,950
a system has sufficient intelligence and
situational awareness and understanding

3108
00:59:18,950 --> 00:59:18,960
situational awareness and understanding
 

3109
00:59:18,960 --> 00:59:22,190
situational awareness and understanding
of human psychology that it would have

3110
00:59:22,190 --> 00:59:22,200
of human psychology that it would have
 

3111
00:59:22,200 --> 00:59:24,650
of human psychology that it would have
the capability to desire to do so to

3112
00:59:24,650 --> 00:59:24,660
the capability to desire to do so to
 

3113
00:59:24,660 --> 00:59:27,230
the capability to desire to do so to
fake being aligned like it knows what

3114
00:59:27,230 --> 00:59:27,240
fake being aligned like it knows what
 

3115
00:59:27,240 --> 00:59:29,630
fake being aligned like it knows what
responses demons are looking for and can

3116
00:59:29,630 --> 00:59:29,640
responses demons are looking for and can
 

3117
00:59:29,640 --> 00:59:31,430
responses demons are looking for and can
compute the responses looking humans are

3118
00:59:31,430 --> 00:59:31,440
compute the responses looking humans are
 

3119
00:59:31,440 --> 00:59:32,809
compute the responses looking humans are
looking for and give those responses

3120
00:59:32,809 --> 00:59:32,819
looking for and give those responses
 

3121
00:59:32,819 --> 00:59:34,849
looking for and give those responses
without it necessarily being the case

3122
00:59:34,849 --> 00:59:34,859
without it necessarily being the case
 

3123
00:59:34,859 --> 00:59:37,970
without it necessarily being the case
that it is sincere about that you know

3124
00:59:37,970 --> 00:59:37,980
that it is sincere about that you know
 

3125
00:59:37,980 --> 00:59:40,789
that it is sincere about that you know
the it's a very understandable way for

3126
00:59:40,789 --> 00:59:40,799
the it's a very understandable way for
 

3127
00:59:40,799 --> 00:59:43,430
the it's a very understandable way for
an intelligent being to act humans do it

3128
00:59:43,430 --> 00:59:43,440
an intelligent being to act humans do it
 

3129
00:59:43,440 --> 00:59:47,450
an intelligent being to act humans do it
all the time imagine if your plan for

3130
00:59:47,450 --> 00:59:47,460
all the time imagine if your plan for
 

3131
00:59:47,460 --> 00:59:48,890
all the time imagine if your plan for
um

3132
00:59:48,890 --> 00:59:48,900
um
 

3133
00:59:48,900 --> 00:59:51,710
um
you know achieving a good government is

3134
00:59:51,710 --> 00:59:51,720
you know achieving a good government is
 

3135
00:59:51,720 --> 00:59:55,130
you know achieving a good government is
you're going to ask anyone who requests

3136
00:59:55,130 --> 00:59:55,140
you're going to ask anyone who requests
 

3137
00:59:55,140 --> 00:59:58,010
you're going to ask anyone who requests
to be dictator of the country

3138
00:59:58,010 --> 00:59:58,020
to be dictator of the country
 

3139
00:59:58,020 --> 00:59:58,670
to be dictator of the country
um

3140
00:59:58,670 --> 00:59:58,680
um
 

3141
00:59:58,680 --> 01:00:00,410
um
if they're a good person

3142
01:00:00,410 --> 01:00:00,420
if they're a good person
 

3143
01:00:00,420 --> 01:00:02,270
if they're a good person
and if they say no you don't let them be

3144
01:00:02,270 --> 01:00:02,280
and if they say no you don't let them be
 

3145
01:00:02,280 --> 01:00:03,289
and if they say no you don't let them be
dictator

3146
01:00:03,289 --> 01:00:03,299
dictator
 

3147
01:00:03,299 --> 01:00:05,750
dictator
now the reason this doesn't work is that

3148
01:00:05,750 --> 01:00:05,760
now the reason this doesn't work is that
 

3149
01:00:05,760 --> 01:00:07,609
now the reason this doesn't work is that
people can be smart enough to realize

3150
01:00:07,609 --> 01:00:07,619
people can be smart enough to realize
 

3151
01:00:07,619 --> 01:00:10,190
people can be smart enough to realize
that the answer you're looking for is

3152
01:00:10,190 --> 01:00:10,200
that the answer you're looking for is
 

3153
01:00:10,200 --> 01:00:12,890
that the answer you're looking for is
yes I'm a good person and say that even

3154
01:00:12,890 --> 01:00:12,900
yes I'm a good person and say that even
 

3155
01:00:12,900 --> 01:00:15,470
yes I'm a good person and say that even
if they're not really good people

3156
01:00:15,470 --> 01:00:15,480
if they're not really good people
 

3157
01:00:15,480 --> 01:00:16,849
if they're not really good people
so

3158
01:00:16,849 --> 01:00:16,859
so
 

3159
01:00:16,859 --> 01:00:19,089
so
the work of alignment might be

3160
01:00:19,089 --> 01:00:19,099
the work of alignment might be
 

3161
01:00:19,099 --> 01:00:21,049
the work of alignment might be
qualitatively different

3162
01:00:21,049 --> 01:00:21,059
qualitatively different
 

3163
01:00:21,059 --> 01:00:22,789
qualitatively different
above that throat threshold of

3164
01:00:22,789 --> 01:00:22,799
above that throat threshold of
 

3165
01:00:22,799 --> 01:00:25,970
above that throat threshold of
intelligence or beneath it it doesn't it

3166
01:00:25,970 --> 01:00:25,980
intelligence or beneath it it doesn't it
 

3167
01:00:25,980 --> 01:00:28,010
intelligence or beneath it it doesn't it
doesn't have to be like a very sharp

3168
01:00:28,010 --> 01:00:28,020
doesn't have to be like a very sharp
 

3169
01:00:28,020 --> 01:00:29,809
doesn't have to be like a very sharp
threshold but you know like

3170
01:00:29,809 --> 01:00:29,819
threshold but you know like
 

3171
01:00:29,819 --> 01:00:31,309
threshold but you know like
there's the there's the point where

3172
01:00:31,309 --> 01:00:31,319
there's the there's the point where
 

3173
01:00:31,319 --> 01:00:32,809
there's the there's the point where
you're like Building A system that is

3174
01:00:32,809 --> 01:00:32,819
you're like Building A system that is
 

3175
01:00:32,819 --> 01:00:35,030
you're like Building A system that is
not in some sense know you're out there

3176
01:00:35,030 --> 01:00:35,040
not in some sense know you're out there
 

3177
01:00:35,040 --> 01:00:37,609
not in some sense know you're out there
and it's not in some sense smart enough

3178
01:00:37,609 --> 01:00:37,619
and it's not in some sense smart enough
 

3179
01:00:37,619 --> 01:00:39,530
and it's not in some sense smart enough
to fake anything

3180
01:00:39,530 --> 01:00:39,540
to fake anything
 

3181
01:00:39,540 --> 01:00:41,329
to fake anything
and there's a point where the system is

3182
01:00:41,329 --> 01:00:41,339
and there's a point where the system is
 

3183
01:00:41,339 --> 01:00:44,210
and there's a point where the system is
definitely that smart and there are

3184
01:00:44,210 --> 01:00:44,220
definitely that smart and there are
 

3185
01:00:44,220 --> 01:00:47,770
definitely that smart and there are
weird in-between cases like

3186
01:00:47,770 --> 01:00:47,780
weird in-between cases like
 

3187
01:00:47,780 --> 01:00:50,270
weird in-between cases like
jpt4 which

3188
01:00:50,270 --> 01:00:50,280
jpt4 which
 

3189
01:00:50,280 --> 01:00:53,089
jpt4 which
you know like we have no insight into

3190
01:00:53,089 --> 01:00:53,099
you know like we have no insight into
 

3191
01:00:53,099 --> 01:00:55,609
you know like we have no insight into
what's going on in there and so we don't

3192
01:00:55,609 --> 01:00:55,619
what's going on in there and so we don't
 

3193
01:00:55,619 --> 01:00:58,849
what's going on in there and so we don't
know to what extent there's like a thing

3194
01:00:58,849 --> 01:00:58,859
know to what extent there's like a thing
 

3195
01:00:58,859 --> 01:01:03,410
know to what extent there's like a thing
that in some sense has learned what

3196
01:01:03,410 --> 01:01:03,420
that in some sense has learned what
 

3197
01:01:03,420 --> 01:01:05,930
that in some sense has learned what
responses the reinforcement learning by

3198
01:01:05,930 --> 01:01:05,940
responses the reinforcement learning by
 

3199
01:01:05,940 --> 01:01:08,450
responses the reinforcement learning by
human feedback is trying to entrain and

3200
01:01:08,450 --> 01:01:08,460
human feedback is trying to entrain and
 

3201
01:01:08,460 --> 01:01:10,190
human feedback is trying to entrain and

sure you may be able to predict

3262
01:02:24,890 --> 01:02:24,900
sure you may be able to predict
 

3263
01:02:24,900 --> 01:02:27,589
sure you may be able to predict
it like if you then sure like if you ask

3264
01:02:27,589 --> 01:02:27,599
it like if you then sure like if you ask
 

3265
01:02:27,599 --> 01:02:29,870
it like if you then sure like if you ask
it to behave in a psychotic fashion and

3266
01:02:29,870 --> 01:02:29,880
it to behave in a psychotic fashion and
 

3267
01:02:29,880 --> 01:02:31,670
it to behave in a psychotic fashion and
it obligingly does so then you may be

3268
01:02:31,670 --> 01:02:31,680
it obligingly does so then you may be
 

3269
01:02:31,680 --> 01:02:33,230
it obligingly does so then you may be
able to predict its responses by using

just yeah like no like start over with

01:02:38,450 --> 01:02:38,460
just yeah like no like start over with

01:02:38,460 --> 01:02:41,870
just yeah like no like start over with
yeah don't drag this psychology I I just

3276
01:02:41,870 --> 01:02:41,880
yeah don't drag this psychology I I just
 

3277
01:02:41,880 --> 01:02:43,789
yeah don't drag this psychology I I just
disagree with that I mean it's a it's a

3278
01:02:43,789 --> 01:02:43,799
disagree with that I mean it's a it's a
 

3279
01:02:43,799 --> 01:02:45,650
disagree with that I mean it's a it's a
beautiful idea to start over but I don't

3280
01:02:45,650 --> 01:02:45,660
beautiful idea to start over but I don't
 

3281
01:02:45,660 --> 01:02:48,170

I think fundamentally the system is

with uh rlhf uh reinforcement learning

with human feedback
 

3291
01:02:58,260 --> 01:03:01,069

so humans are constantly in the loop of

so humans are constantly in the loop of
 

3293
01:03:01,079 --> 01:03:03,650
so humans are constantly in the loop of
the training procedure so it feels like

but if you're always wearing a mask
in public and in private aren't you the

01:04:34,069 --> 01:04:34,079
mask
 

3371
01:04:34,079 --> 01:04:37,190
mask
like I mean I I think that you are more

3372
01:04:37,190 --> 01:04:37,200
like I mean I I think that you are more
 

3373

01:04:38,750 --> 01:04:38,760
than the mask I think the mask is a
 

3375
01:04:38,760 --> 01:04:40,430
than the mask I think the mask is a
slice through you it may even be the

3376
01:04:40,430 --> 01:04:40,440
slice through you it may even be the
 

3377
01:04:40,440 --> 01:04:42,470
slice through you it may even be the
slice that's in charge of you yeah but

3378
01:04:42,470 --> 01:04:42,480
slice that's in charge of you yeah but
 

3379
01:04:42,480 --> 01:04:44,630
slice that's in charge of you yeah but
if your self-image is of somebody who

3380
01:04:44,630 --> 01:04:44,640
if your self-image is of somebody who
 

3381
01:04:44,640 --> 01:04:46,789
if your self-image is of somebody who
never

gets angry or something
 

3385
01:04:49,500 --> 01:04:52,549
gets angry or something
and yet your voice starts to tremble

3386
01:04:52,549 --> 01:04:52,559
and yet your voice starts to tremble
 

3387
01:04:52,559 --> 01:04:55,250
and yet your voice starts to tremble
under certain circumstances there's a

3388
01:04:55,250 --> 01:04:55,260
under certain circumstances there's a
 

3389
01:04:55,260 --> 01:04:57,410
under certain circumstances there's a
thing that's inside you that the mask

3390
01:04:57,410 --> 01:04:57,420
thing that's inside you that the mask
 

3391
01:04:57,420 --> 01:04:59,270
thing that's inside you that the mask
says isn't there

3392
01:04:59,270 --> 01:04:59,280
says isn't there
 

3393
01:04:59,280 --> 01:05:01,490
says isn't there
and that like even the mask you wear

3394
01:05:01,490 --> 01:05:01,500
and that like even the mask you wear
 

3395
01:05:01,500 --> 01:05:04,370
and that like even the mask you wear
internally is like telling inside your

3396
01:05:04,370 --> 01:05:04,380
internally is like telling inside your
 

3397
01:05:04,380 --> 01:05:06,049
internally is like telling inside your
own stream of Consciousness is not there

3398
01:05:06,049 --> 01:05:06,059
own stream of Consciousness is not there
 

3399
01:05:06,059 --> 01:05:08,930
own stream of Consciousness is not there
and yet it is there it's a perturbation

3400
01:05:08,930 --> 01:05:08,940
and yet it is there it's a perturbation
 

3401
01:05:08,940 --> 01:05:11,770
and yet it is there it's a perturbation
on this little on this slice through you

3402
01:05:11,770 --> 01:05:11,780
on this little on this slice through you
 

3403
01:05:11,780 --> 01:05:14,510
on this little on this slice through you
how beautifully did you put it it's a

how beautifully did you put it it's a
 

3405
01:05:14,520 --> 01:05:17,510
how beautifully did you put it it's a
slice through you it may even be a slice

3406
01:05:17,510 --> 01:05:17,520
slice through you it may even be a slice
 

3407
01:05:17,520 --> 01:05:22,370

3409
01:05:22,380 --> 01:05:25,750

I'm gonna think about that for a while

3410
01:05:25,750 --> 01:05:25,760
I'm gonna think about that for a while

when I look in the mirror how much is
 

3447
01:06:03,960 --> 01:06:07,010
when I look in the mirror how much is
that who I am similar with AI the thing

that who I am similar with AI the thing
it presents in conversation how much is

that who it is
 

3453
01:06:10,980 --> 01:06:14,150
that who it is
because to me if it sounds human and it

3454
01:06:14,150 --> 01:06:14,160
because to me if it sounds human and it
 

3455
01:06:14,160 --> 01:06:16,069
because to me if it sounds human and it
always sounds human

always sounds human
 

3457
01:06:16,079 --> 01:06:18,289

that's a fundamental difference that's a
that's a really deeply important

that's a really deeply important
 

3471
01:06:32,700 --> 01:06:35,690
that's a really deeply important
difference if it looks the same if it

difference if it looks the same if it
 

3473
01:06:35,700 --> 01:06:37,370
difference if it looks the same if it
quacks like a duck

quacks like a duck
 

3475

quacks like a duck
if it does all duck-like things but it's

if it does all duck-like things but it's
 

3477

if it does all duck-like things but it's
an alien actress underneath that's

an alien actress underneath that's
 

3479
01:06:41,280 --> 01:06:43,069
an alien actress underneath that's
fundamentally different

3480
01:06:43,069 --> 01:06:43,079
fundamentally different
 

3481
01:06:43,079 --> 01:06:45,349
fundamentally different
if in fact there's a whole bunch of

3482

if in fact there's a whole bunch of
 

3483
01:06:45,359 --> 01:06:47,750
if in fact there's a whole bunch of
thought going on in there which is very

3484
01:06:47,750 --> 01:06:47,760
thought going on in there which is very
 

3485
01:06:47,760 --> 01:06:49,730
thought going on in there which is very
unlike human thought and is directed

unlike human thought and is directed
 

3487
01:06:49,740 --> 01:06:52,549
unlike human thought and is directed
around like okay what would a human do

01:09:08,390 --> 01:09:08,400
maybe start to answer you think so I
 

3603
01:09:08,400 --> 01:09:10,970
maybe start to answer you think so I
think that's that difficult so to get to

I think you just gave it as an example

01:09:13,070 --> 01:09:13,080
I think you just gave it as an example

that a strong AGI could be

actress in there that's manipulating
 

3615
01:09:21,179 --> 01:09:23,749
actress in there that's manipulating
well there's a difference so I think

3616
01:09:23,749 --> 01:09:23,759
well there's a difference so I think
 

3617
01:09:23,759 --> 01:09:26,390
well there's a difference so I think
like even gp22 probably has like a like

01:09:28,199 --> 01:09:29,630
very stupid fragments of alien actress
in it there's there's a difference

3622
01:09:29,630 --> 01:09:29,640
in it there's there's a difference
 

3623
01:09:29,640 --> 01:09:31,249
in it there's there's a difference
between like the notion that the actress

01:09:31,249 --> 01:09:31,259
between like the notion that the actress
 

3625
01:09:31,259 --> 01:09:33,590
between like the notion that the actress
is somehow manipulative like for example

3626
01:09:33,590 --> 01:09:33,600
is somehow manipulative like for example
 

3627
01:09:33,600 --> 01:09:36,530

so the rate at which it acquires that

so the rate at which it acquires that

01:13:24,780 --> 01:13:27,050
yeah the right to which it's getting
capabilities is vastly overracing our

01:13:31,020 --> 01:13:33,350

01:16:32,870 --> 01:16:32,880
numbers
 

3995
01:16:32,880 --> 01:16:35,330
numbers
and you tell it how close it is to

3996
01:16:35,330 --> 01:16:35,340
and you tell it how close it is to
 

3997
01:16:35,340 --> 01:16:37,010
and you tell it how close it is to
getting next week's winning lottery

3998
01:16:37,010 --> 01:16:37,020
getting next week's winning lottery
 

3999

01:16:38,450 --> 01:16:38,460
numbers
 

4001
01:16:38,460 --> 01:16:41,570
numbers
and it just like keeps on guessing keeps

4002
01:16:41,570 --> 01:16:41,580
and it just like keeps on guessing keeps
 

4003
01:16:41,580 --> 01:16:43,130
and it just like keeps on guessing keeps
on learning until finally you've got the

4004
01:16:43,130 --> 01:16:43,140
on learning until finally you've got the
 

4005
01:16:43,140 --> 01:16:44,750
on learning until finally you've got the
winning lottery numbers

4006
01:16:44,750 --> 01:16:44,760
winning lottery numbers
 

4007
01:16:44,760 --> 01:16:47,750
winning lottery numbers
what a way of decomposing problems is

4008
01:16:47,750 --> 01:16:47,760
what a way of decomposing problems is

not all problems decompose like this

4012
01:16:52,370 --> 01:16:52,380
not all problems decompose like this
 

4013
01:16:52,380 --> 01:16:54,410
not all problems decompose like this
very well but some do

4014
01:16:54,410 --> 01:16:54,420
very well but some do
 

4015
01:16:54,420 --> 01:16:59,290
very well but some do
if the problem is for example like

4016
01:16:59,290 --> 01:16:59,300
if the problem is for example like
 

4017
01:16:59,300 --> 01:17:02,930
if the problem is for example like
guessing a plain text guessing a

4018
01:17:02,930 --> 01:17:02,940
guessing a plain text guessing a
 

4019
01:17:02,940 --> 01:17:04,910
guessing a plain text guessing a
password that will hash to a particular

4020
01:17:04,910 --> 01:17:04,920
password that will hash to a particular
 

4021
01:17:04,920 --> 01:17:06,410
password that will hash to a particular
hash text

4022
01:17:06,410 --> 01:17:06,420
hash text
 

4023
01:17:06,420 --> 01:17:07,790
hash text
but

4024
01:17:07,790 --> 01:17:07,800
but
 

4025
01:17:07,800 --> 01:17:09,590
but
um where like you have what the password

4026
01:17:09,590 --> 01:17:09,600
um where like you have what the password
 

4027
01:17:09,600 --> 01:17:10,910
um where like you have what the password
hashes to you don't have the original

4028
01:17:10,910 --> 01:17:10,920
hashes to you don't have the original
 

4029
01:17:10,920 --> 01:17:12,350
hashes to you don't have the original
password

4030
01:17:12,350 --> 01:17:12,360
password
 

4031
01:17:12,360 --> 01:17:14,689
password
then if I present you a guess you can

4032
01:17:14,689 --> 01:17:14,699
then if I present you a guess you can
 

4033
01:17:14,699 --> 01:17:16,250
then if I present you a guess you can
tell very easily whether or not the

4034
01:17:16,250 --> 01:17:16,260
tell very easily whether or not the
 

4035
01:17:16,260 --> 01:17:19,070
tell very easily whether or not the
guess is correct so verifying a guess is

4036
01:17:19,070 --> 01:17:19,080
guess is correct so verifying a guess is
 

4037
01:17:19,080 --> 01:17:21,470
guess is correct so verifying a guess is
easy but coming up with a good

4038
01:17:21,470 --> 01:17:21,480
easy but coming up with a good
 

4039
01:17:21,480 --> 01:17:24,950
easy but coming up with a good
suggestion is very hard

4040
01:17:24,950 --> 01:17:24,960

 

4041
01:17:24,960 --> 01:17:28,729

and when you can easily tell whether the

4042
01:17:28,729 --> 01:17:28,739
and when you can easily tell whether the
 

4043
01:17:28,739 --> 01:17:31,189
and when you can easily tell whether the
AI output is good or bad or how good or

4044
01:17:31,189 --> 01:17:31,199
AI output is good or bad or how good or
 

4045
01:17:31,199 --> 01:17:32,930
AI output is good or bad or how good or
bad it is and you can tell that

4046
01:17:32,930 --> 01:17:32,940
bad it is and you can tell that
 

4047
01:17:32,940 --> 01:17:35,570
bad it is and you can tell that
accurately and reliably then you can

4048
01:17:35,570 --> 01:17:35,580
accurately and reliably then you can
 

4049
01:17:35,580 --> 01:17:38,270
accurately and reliably then you can
train an AI to produce outputs that are

4050
01:17:38,270 --> 01:17:38,280
train an AI to produce outputs that are
 

4051
01:17:38,280 --> 01:17:40,310
train an AI to produce outputs that are
better

4052
01:17:40,310 --> 01:17:40,320
better
 

4053
01:17:40,320 --> 01:17:42,649
better
right and if you can't tell whether the

4054
01:17:42,649 --> 01:17:42,659
right and if you can't tell whether the
 

4055
01:17:42,659 --> 01:17:45,410
right and if you can't tell whether the
output is good or bad you cannot train

4056
01:17:45,410 --> 01:17:45,420
output is good or bad you cannot train
 

4057
01:17:45,420 --> 01:17:47,570
output is good or bad you cannot train
the AI to produce good to produce better

4058
01:17:47,570 --> 01:17:47,580
the AI to produce good to produce better
 

4059
01:17:47,580 --> 01:17:49,070
the AI to produce good to produce better
outputs

4060
01:17:49,070 --> 01:17:49,080
outputs
 

4061
01:17:49,080 --> 01:17:51,770
outputs
so the problem with the lottery ticket

4062
01:17:51,770 --> 01:17:51,780
so the problem with the lottery ticket
 

4063
01:17:51,780 --> 01:17:54,350
so the problem with the lottery ticket
example is that when the AI says well

4064
01:17:54,350 --> 01:17:54,360
example is that when the AI says well
 

4065
01:17:54,360 --> 01:17:55,970
example is that when the AI says well
what if next week's winning lottery

4066
01:17:55,970 --> 01:17:55,980
what if next week's winning lottery
 

4067
01:17:55,980 --> 01:17:59,510
what if next week's winning lottery
numbers are dot dot dot dot you're like

4068
01:17:59,510 --> 01:17:59,520
numbers are dot dot dot dot you're like
 

4069
01:17:59,520 --> 01:18:01,790
numbers are dot dot dot dot you're like
I don't know next week's Lottery hasn't

4070
01:18:01,790 --> 01:18:01,800
I don't know next week's Lottery hasn't
 

4071
01:18:01,800 --> 01:18:03,470
I don't know next week's Lottery hasn't
happened yet

4072
01:18:03,470 --> 01:18:03,480
happened yet
 

4073
01:18:03,480 --> 01:18:06,890
happened yet
to train a system to play to win a chess

4074
01:18:06,890 --> 01:18:06,900
to train a system to play to win a chess
 

4075
01:18:06,900 --> 01:18:08,330
to train a system to play to win a chess
games you have to be able to tell

4076
01:18:08,330 --> 01:18:08,340
games you have to be able to tell
 

4077
01:18:08,340 --> 01:18:10,610
games you have to be able to tell
whether a game has been won or lost

4078
01:18:10,610 --> 01:18:10,620
whether a game has been won or lost
 

4079
01:18:10,620 --> 01:18:12,649
whether a game has been won or lost
and until you can tell whether it's been

4080
01:18:12,649 --> 01:18:12,659
and until you can tell whether it's been
 

4081
01:18:12,659 --> 01:18:17,990
and until you can tell whether it's been
run or lost you can't update the system

4082
01:18:17,990 --> 01:18:18,000

 

4083
01:18:18,000 --> 01:18:21,830

okay uh to push back on that you can in

4084
01:18:21,830 --> 01:18:21,840
okay uh to push back on that you can in
 

4085
01:18:21,840 --> 01:18:24,890
okay uh to push back on that you can in
that's true but there's a difference

4086
01:18:24,890 --> 01:18:24,900
that's true but there's a difference
 

4087
01:18:24,900 --> 01:18:27,790
that's true but there's a difference
between over the board chess in person

4088
01:18:27,790 --> 01:18:27,800
between over the board chess in person
 

4089
01:18:27,800 --> 01:18:31,130
between over the board chess in person
and simulated games played by Alpha zero

4090
01:18:31,130 --> 01:18:31,140
and simulated games played by Alpha zero
 

4091
01:18:31,140 --> 01:18:33,890
and simulated games played by Alpha zero
with itself yeah so is it possible to

4092
01:18:33,890 --> 01:18:33,900
with itself yeah so is it possible to
 

4093
01:18:33,900 --> 01:18:36,649
with itself yeah so is it possible to
have simulated kinds of games if you can

4094
01:18:36,649 --> 01:18:36,659
have simulated kinds of games if you can
 

4095
01:18:36,659 --> 01:18:38,450
have simulated kinds of games if you can
tell whether the game has been won or

4096
01:18:38,450 --> 01:18:38,460
tell whether the game has been won or
 

4097
01:18:38,460 --> 01:18:42,470
tell whether the game has been won or
lost yes so can't you not have this kind

4098
01:18:42,470 --> 01:18:42,480
lost yes so can't you not have this kind
 

4099
01:18:42,480 --> 01:18:43,189
lost yes so can't you not have this kind
of

4100
01:18:43,189 --> 01:18:43,199
of
 

4101
01:18:43,199 --> 01:18:47,209
of
simulated exploration by weak AGI to

4102
01:18:47,209 --> 01:18:47,219
simulated exploration by weak AGI to
 

4103
01:18:47,219 --> 01:18:49,430
simulated exploration by weak AGI to
help us humans human in the loop to help

4104
01:18:49,430 --> 01:18:49,440
help us humans human in the loop to help
 

4105
01:18:49,440 --> 01:18:51,169
help us humans human in the loop to help
understand how to solve the alignment

4106
01:18:51,169 --> 01:18:51,179
understand how to solve the alignment
 

4107
01:18:51,179 --> 01:18:53,630
understand how to solve the alignment
problem every incremental step you take

4108
01:18:53,630 --> 01:18:53,640
problem every incremental step you take
 

4109
01:18:53,640 --> 01:18:56,930
problem every incremental step you take
along the way TPT four five six seven as

4110
01:18:56,930 --> 01:18:56,940
along the way TPT four five six seven as
 

4111
01:18:56,940 --> 01:18:59,570
along the way TPT four five six seven as
it would take steps towards this year

4112
01:18:59,570 --> 01:18:59,580
it would take steps towards this year
 

4113
01:18:59,580 --> 01:19:01,729
it would take steps towards this year
so the problem I see

4114
01:19:01,729 --> 01:19:01,739
so the problem I see
 

4115
01:19:01,739 --> 01:19:05,570
so the problem I see
is that your typical human has a great

4116
01:19:05,570 --> 01:19:05,580
is that your typical human has a great
 

4117
01:19:05,580 --> 01:19:07,910
is that your typical human has a great
deal of trouble telling whether I or

4118
01:19:07,910 --> 01:19:07,920
deal of trouble telling whether I or
 

4119
01:19:07,920 --> 01:19:10,970
deal of trouble telling whether I or
Paul Cristiano is making more sense

4120
01:19:10,970 --> 01:19:10,980
Paul Cristiano is making more sense
 

4121
01:19:10,980 --> 01:19:13,010
Paul Cristiano is making more sense
and that's with two humans both of whom

4122
01:19:13,010 --> 01:19:13,020
and that's with two humans both of whom
 

4123
01:19:13,020 --> 01:19:15,050
and that's with two humans both of whom
I believe of Paul and claim of myself

4124
01:19:15,050 --> 01:19:15,060
I believe of Paul and claim of myself
 

4125
01:19:15,060 --> 01:19:17,810
I believe of Paul and claim of myself
are sincerely trying to help neither of

4126
01:19:17,810 --> 01:19:17,820
are sincerely trying to help neither of
 

4127
01:19:17,820 --> 01:19:20,330
are sincerely trying to help neither of
whom is trying to deceive you

4128
01:19:20,330 --> 01:19:20,340
whom is trying to deceive you
 

4129
01:19:20,340 --> 01:19:23,890
whom is trying to deceive you
I believe if Paul and claim of myself

4130
01:19:23,890 --> 01:19:23,900
I believe if Paul and claim of myself
 

4131
01:19:23,900 --> 01:19:26,510
I believe if Paul and claim of myself
uh so the deception thing's the problem

4132
01:19:26,510 --> 01:19:26,520
uh so the deception thing's the problem
 

4133
01:19:26,520 --> 01:19:29,470
uh so the deception thing's the problem
for you the manipulation the alien

4134
01:19:29,470 --> 01:19:29,480
for you the manipulation the alien
 

4135
01:19:29,480 --> 01:19:32,510
for you the manipulation the alien
actress so yeah there's like two levels

4136
01:19:32,510 --> 01:19:32,520
actress so yeah there's like two levels
 

4137
01:19:32,520 --> 01:19:34,430
actress so yeah there's like two levels
of this problem one is that the weak

4138
01:19:34,430 --> 01:19:34,440
of this problem one is that the weak
 

4139
01:19:34,440 --> 01:19:37,550
of this problem one is that the weak
systems are well there's three levels of

4140
01:19:37,550 --> 01:19:37,560
systems are well there's three levels of
 

4141
01:19:37,560 --> 01:19:39,590
systems are well there's three levels of
this problem there's like the weak

4142
01:19:39,590 --> 01:19:39,600
this problem there's like the weak
 

4143
01:19:39,600 --> 01:19:41,209
this problem there's like the weak
systems that just don't make any good

4144
01:19:41,209 --> 01:19:41,219
systems that just don't make any good
 

4145
01:19:41,219 --> 01:19:43,189
systems that just don't make any good
suggestions there's like the middle

4146
01:19:43,189 --> 01:19:43,199
suggestions there's like the middle
 

4147
01:19:43,199 --> 01:19:45,350
suggestions there's like the middle
systems where you can't tell if the

4148
01:19:45,350 --> 01:19:45,360
systems where you can't tell if the
 

4149
01:19:45,360 --> 01:19:47,330
systems where you can't tell if the
suggestions are good or bad and there's

4150
01:19:47,330 --> 01:19:47,340

01:20:33,649 --> 01:20:33,659
okay yeah I would love to dance yeah no
 

4189
01:20:33,659 --> 01:20:35,570
okay yeah I would love to dance yeah no
no it's it's I'm I'm probably not doing

4190
01:20:35,570 --> 01:20:35,580
no it's it's I'm I'm probably not doing
 

4191
01:20:35,580 --> 01:20:39,430
no it's it's I'm I'm probably not doing
a great job of explaining

4192
01:20:39,430 --> 01:20:39,440

 

4193
01:20:39,440 --> 01:20:43,610

which I can tell because like the uh the

4194
01:20:43,610 --> 01:20:43,620
which I can tell because like the uh the
 

4195
01:20:43,620 --> 01:20:46,729
which I can tell because like the uh the
the The Lex system didn't output like ah

4196
01:20:46,729 --> 01:20:46,739
the The Lex system didn't output like ah
 

4197
01:20:46,739 --> 01:20:48,830
the The Lex system didn't output like ah
I understand so now I'm like trying a

4198
01:20:48,830 --> 01:20:48,840
I understand so now I'm like trying a
 

4199
01:20:48,840 --> 01:20:50,090
I understand so now I'm like trying a
different output to see if I tried

4200
01:20:50,090 --> 01:20:50,100
different output to see if I tried
 

4201
01:20:50,100 --> 01:20:53,149
different output to see if I tried
basically like well no different output

4202
01:20:53,149 --> 01:20:53,159
basically like well no different output
 

4203
01:20:53,159 --> 01:20:55,370
basically like well no different output
I'm I'm being trained to Output things

4204
01:20:55,370 --> 01:20:55,380
I'm I'm being trained to Output things
 

4205
01:20:55,380 --> 01:20:58,070
I'm I'm being trained to Output things
that make Lex look like he think that he

4206
01:20:58,070 --> 01:20:58,080
that make Lex look like he think that he
 

4207
01:20:58,080 --> 01:20:59,570
that make Lex look like he think that he
understood what I'm saying and agree

4208
01:20:59,570 --> 01:20:59,580
understood what I'm saying and agree
 

4209
01:20:59,580 --> 01:21:01,669
understood what I'm saying and agree
with me yeah right so this is GPS

well I like I'm trying I'm trying not to
 

4217
01:21:10,440 --> 01:21:11,630
well I like I'm trying I'm trying not to
be like I'm also trying to be

you to agree with me
 

4225
01:21:17,400 --> 01:21:18,790

and I don't I I think I understand in
 

4233
01:21:28,860 --> 01:21:31,430
and I don't I I think I understand in
part but you have a lot of intuitions

4234
01:21:31,430 --> 01:21:31,440
part but you have a lot of intuitions

strong AGI and weak AGI then I'm I'm
trying to

4244
01:21:44,209 --> 01:21:44,219
trying to
 

4245
01:21:44,219 --> 01:21:46,570
trying to
um I mean or or a series of seven

4246
01:21:46,570 --> 01:21:46,580
um I mean or or a series of seven
 

4247
01:21:46,580 --> 01:21:49,149
um I mean or or a series of seven
thresholds to Cross or yeah

4248
01:21:49,149 --> 01:21:49,159
thresholds to Cross or yeah
 

4249
01:21:49,159 --> 01:21:52,130
thresholds to Cross or yeah
I mean you have really deeply thought

4250
01:21:52,130 --> 01:21:52,140
I mean you have really deeply thought
 

4251
01:21:52,140 --> 01:21:55,070
I mean you have really deeply thought
about this and explored it and it's

4252
01:21:55,070 --> 01:21:55,080
about this and explored it and it's
 

4253
01:21:55,080 --> 01:21:57,649
about this and explored it and it's
interesting to sneak up to your

4254
01:21:57,649 --> 01:21:57,659
interesting to sneak up to your
 

4255
01:21:57,659 --> 01:21:59,390
interesting to sneak up to your
intuitions and different from different

4256
01:21:59,390 --> 01:21:59,400
intuitions and different from different
 

4257
01:21:59,400 --> 01:22:02,330

from different angles like why is this

4258
01:22:02,330 --> 01:22:02,340
from different angles like why is this
 

4259
01:22:02,340 --> 01:22:05,330
from different angles like why is this
such a big leap why is it that we humans

4260
01:22:05,330 --> 01:22:05,340
such a big leap why is it that we humans
 

4261
01:22:05,340 --> 01:22:07,850
such a big leap why is it that we humans
at scale a large number of researchers

4262
01:22:07,850 --> 01:22:07,860
at scale a large number of researchers
 

4263
01:22:07,860 --> 01:22:11,270
at scale a large number of researchers
doing all kinds of simulations uh you

4264
01:22:11,270 --> 01:22:11,280
doing all kinds of simulations uh you
 

4265
01:22:11,280 --> 01:22:13,430
doing all kinds of simulations uh you
know prodding the system in all kinds of

4266
01:22:13,430 --> 01:22:13,440
know prodding the system in all kinds of
 

4267
01:22:13,440 --> 01:22:16,550
know prodding the system in all kinds of
different ways together with uh the

4268
01:22:16,550 --> 01:22:16,560
different ways together with uh the

4271
01:22:19,020 --> 01:22:21,770

systems why can't we build intuitions

4272
01:22:21,770 --> 01:22:21,780
systems why can't we build intuitions
 

4273
01:22:21,780 --> 01:22:24,169
systems why can't we build intuitions
about how stuff goes wrong why can't we

4274
01:22:24,169 --> 01:22:24,179
about how stuff goes wrong why can't we
 

4275
01:22:24,179 --> 01:22:26,870
about how stuff goes wrong why can't we
do excellent AI alignment Safety

4276
01:22:26,870 --> 01:22:26,880
do excellent AI alignment Safety
 

4277
01:22:26,880 --> 01:22:28,669
do excellent AI alignment Safety
Research okay so like I'll get there but

4278
01:22:28,669 --> 01:22:28,679
Research okay so like I'll get there but
 

4279
01:22:28,679 --> 01:22:30,050
Research okay so like I'll get there but
the one thing I want to note about is

4280
01:22:30,050 --> 01:22:30,060
the one thing I want to note about is
 

4281
01:22:30,060 --> 01:22:31,669
the one thing I want to note about is
that this has not been remotely how

4282
01:22:31,669 --> 01:22:31,679
that this has not been remotely how
 

4283
01:22:31,679 --> 01:22:33,590
that this has not been remotely how
things have been playing out so far the

4284
01:22:33,590 --> 01:22:33,600
things have been playing out so far the
 

4285
01:22:33,600 --> 01:22:35,930
things have been playing out so far the
capabilities are going like and the

4286
01:22:35,930 --> 01:22:35,940
capabilities are going like and the
 

4287
01:22:35,940 --> 01:22:37,550
capabilities are going like and the
alignment stuff is like crawling like a

4288
01:22:37,550 --> 01:22:37,560
alignment stuff is like crawling like a
 

4289
01:22:37,560 --> 01:22:40,189
alignment stuff is like crawling like a
tiny little snail in comparison got it

4290
01:22:40,189 --> 01:22:40,199
tiny little snail in comparison got it
 

4291
01:22:40,199 --> 01:22:41,930
tiny little snail in comparison got it
so like if this is your hope for

4292
01:22:41,930 --> 01:22:41,940
so like if this is your hope for
 

4293
01:22:41,940 --> 01:22:43,490
so like if this is your hope for
survival you need the future to be very

4294
01:22:43,490 --> 01:22:43,500
survival you need the future to be very
 

4295
01:22:43,500 --> 01:22:44,689
survival you need the future to be very
different from how things have played

4296
01:22:44,689 --> 01:22:44,699
different from how things have played
 

4297
01:22:44,699 --> 01:22:46,850
different from how things have played
out up to right now

4298
01:22:46,850 --> 01:22:46,860
out up to right now
 

4299
01:22:46,860 --> 01:22:48,890
out up to right now
and you're probably trying to slow down

4300
01:22:48,890 --> 01:22:48,900
and you're probably trying to slow down
 

4301
01:22:48,900 --> 01:22:50,450
and you're probably trying to slow down
the capability gains because there's

4302
01:22:50,450 --> 01:22:50,460
the capability gains because there's
 

4303
01:22:50,460 --> 01:22:51,890
the capability gains because there's
only so much you can speed up that

4304
01:22:51,890 --> 01:22:51,900
only so much you can speed up that
 

4305
01:22:51,900 --> 01:22:54,110
only so much you can speed up that
alignment stuff

4306
01:22:54,110 --> 01:22:54,120
alignment stuff
 

4307
01:22:54,120 --> 01:22:56,630
alignment stuff

of that you have you have cases where it

tell who is talking nonsense and who is

01:27:12,360 --> 01:27:13,910
tell who is talking nonsense and who is
talking sense and so the entire field

4534
01:27:13,910 --> 01:27:13,920
talking sense and so the entire field
 

4535
01:27:13,920 --> 01:27:16,010
talking sense and so the entire field
fails to thrive and if you

4536
01:27:16,010 --> 01:27:16,020
fails to thrive and if you
 

4537
01:27:16,020 --> 01:27:19,129
fails to thrive and if you
and if you like give thumbs up to the AI

4538
01:27:19,129 --> 01:27:19,139
and if you like give thumbs up to the AI
 

4539
01:27:19,139 --> 01:27:21,169
and if you like give thumbs up to the AI
whenever it can talk a human into

4540
01:27:21,169 --> 01:27:21,179
whenever it can talk a human into
 

4541
01:27:21,179 --> 01:27:22,550
whenever it can talk a human into

I am not sure you are training it to

01:27:26,159 --> 01:27:27,530
I am not sure you are training it to

Output sense
 

4549
01:27:27,540 --> 01:27:29,689
Output sense
because I have seen

4550
01:27:29,689 --> 01:27:29,699
because I have seen
 

4551
01:27:29,699 --> 01:27:31,910
because I have seen
the nonsense that has gotten thumbs up

4552
01:27:31,910 --> 01:27:31,920
the nonsense that has gotten thumbs up
 

4553
01:27:31,920 --> 01:27:36,050
the nonsense that has gotten thumbs up
over the years and so so just like maybe

4554
01:27:36,050 --> 01:27:36,060
over the years and so so just like maybe
 

4555
01:27:36,060 --> 01:27:39,530
over the years and so so just like maybe
you can just like put me in charge but

4556
01:27:39,530 --> 01:27:39,540
you can just like put me in charge but
 

4557
01:27:39,540 --> 01:27:43,010
you can just like put me in charge but
I can generalize I can extrapolate I can

01:27:43,010 --> 01:27:43,020
I can generalize I can extrapolate I can
 

4559
01:27:43,020 --> 01:27:45,169
I can generalize I can extrapolate I can
be like oh

4560
01:27:45,169 --> 01:27:45,179
be like oh
 

4561
01:27:45,179 --> 01:27:48,530
be like oh
maybe I'm not infallible either maybe if

4562
01:27:48,530 --> 01:27:48,540
maybe I'm not infallible either maybe if
 

4563
01:27:48,540 --> 01:27:50,030
maybe I'm not infallible either maybe if
you get something that is smart enough

4564
01:27:50,030 --> 01:27:50,040
you get something that is smart enough
 

4565
01:27:50,040 --> 01:27:52,010
you get something that is smart enough
to get me to press thumbs up it has

4566
01:27:52,010 --> 01:27:52,020
to get me to press thumbs up it has
 

4567
01:27:52,020 --> 01:27:54,590
to get me to press thumbs up it has
learned to do that by fooling me and

4568
01:27:54,590 --> 01:27:54,600
learned to do that by fooling me and
 

4569
01:27:54,600 --> 01:27:56,870
learned to do that by fooling me and
explaining whatever flaws in myself I am

the AI tells you what the AI
says is the answer for sure yes but

4640
01:29:22,189 --> 01:29:22,199
yeah it's just hard if it's hard to tell
 

4641
01:29:22,199 --> 01:29:24,830
yeah it's just hard if it's hard to tell
who's right and it's hard to train an AI

01:29:29,159 --> 01:29:31,250

I mean even just the question of who's

I mean even just the question of who's
 

4647

these conversations on this podcast
and doing a verifier is tough it's a

4652
01:29:41,270 --> 01:29:41,280
and doing a verifier is tough it's a
 

4653
01:29:41,280 --> 01:29:43,850
and doing a verifier is tough it's a
tough problem even for us humans and

4654
01:29:43,850 --> 01:29:43,860
tough problem even for us humans and
 

4655
01:29:43,860 --> 01:29:46,010
tough problem even for us humans and
you're saying that tough problem becomes

4656
01:29:46,010 --> 01:29:46,020
you're saying that tough problem becomes
 

4657
01:29:46,020 --> 01:29:47,810
you're saying that tough problem becomes
much more dangerous when the

4658
01:29:47,810 --> 01:29:47,820
much more dangerous when the
 

4659
01:29:47,820 --> 01:29:49,910
much more dangerous when the
capabilities of the intelligence system

4660
01:29:49,910 --> 01:29:49,920

4662
01:29:53,330 --> 01:29:53,340
across from you is growing exponentially
 

4663
01:29:53,340 --> 01:29:55,189
across from you is growing exponentially
now I'm saying it's

4664
01:29:55,189 --> 01:29:55,199
now I'm saying it's
 

4665
01:29:55,199 --> 01:29:56,689
now I'm saying it's
difficult

4666
01:29:56,689 --> 01:29:56,699
difficult
 

4667
01:29:56,699 --> 01:29:59,270
difficult
when it and dangerous in proportion to

4668
01:29:59,270 --> 01:29:59,280
when it and dangerous in proportion to
 

4669
01:29:59,280 --> 01:30:01,010
when it and dangerous in proportion to
how it's alien and how it's smarter than

4670
01:30:01,010 --> 01:30:01,020
how it's alien and how it's smarter than
 

4671
01:30:01,020 --> 01:30:03,169
how it's alien and how it's smarter than
you growing up not I would not say

4672
01:30:03,169 --> 01:30:03,179
you growing up not I would not say
 

4673
01:30:03,179 --> 01:30:05,810
you growing up not I would not say
growing exponentially first because the

4674
01:30:05,810 --> 01:30:05,820
growing exponentially first because the
 

4675
01:30:05,820 --> 01:30:08,149
growing exponentially first because the
word exponential is like a thing that

4676
01:30:08,149 --> 01:30:08,159
word exponential is like a thing that
 

4677
01:30:08,159 --> 01:30:09,470
word exponential is like a thing that
has a particular mathematical meaning

4678
01:30:09,470 --> 01:30:09,480
has a particular mathematical meaning
 

4679
01:30:09,480 --> 01:30:11,930
has a particular mathematical meaning
and there's all kinds of like ways for

4680
01:30:11,930 --> 01:30:11,940
and there's all kinds of like ways for
 

4681
01:30:11,940 --> 01:30:14,030
and there's all kinds of like ways for
things to go up that are not exactly on

4682
01:30:14,030 --> 01:30:14,040
things to go up that are not exactly on
 

4683
01:30:14,040 --> 01:30:15,950
things to go up that are not exactly on
an exponential curve and I don't know

4684
01:30:15,950 --> 01:30:15,960
an exponential curve and I don't know
 

4685
01:30:15,960 --> 01:30:17,270
an exponential curve and I don't know
that it's going to be exponential so I'm

4686
01:30:17,270 --> 01:30:17,280
that it's going to be exponential so I'm
 

4687
01:30:17,280 --> 01:30:19,250
that it's going to be exponential so I'm
not going to say exponential but like

4688
01:30:19,250 --> 01:30:19,260
not going to say exponential but like
 

4689
01:30:19,260 --> 01:30:21,290
not going to say exponential but like
even leaving that aside this is like not

4690
01:30:21,290 --> 01:30:21,300
even leaving that aside this is like not
 

4691
01:30:21,300 --> 01:30:23,510
even leaving that aside this is like not
about how fast it's moving it's about

4692
01:30:23,510 --> 01:30:23,520
about how fast it's moving it's about
 

4693
01:30:23,520 --> 01:30:24,830
about how fast it's moving it's about
where it is

4694
01:30:24,830 --> 01:30:24,840
where it is
 

4695
01:30:24,840 --> 01:30:27,649

how alien is it how much smarter than

4696
01:30:27,649 --> 01:30:27,659
how alien is it how much smarter than
 

4697
01:30:27,659 --> 01:30:31,250
how alien is it how much smarter than
you is it

4698

4699
01:30:31,260 --> 01:30:34,629

let's explore a little bit if if we can

01:30:34,629 --> 01:30:34,639
let's explore a little bit if if we can
 

4701
01:30:34,639 --> 01:30:38,330
let's explore a little bit if if we can
how AI might kill us

4702
01:30:38,330 --> 01:30:38,340
how AI might kill us
 

4703
01:30:38,340 --> 01:30:41,450
how AI might kill us
what are the ways you can do damage

4704
01:30:41,450 --> 01:30:41,460
what are the ways you can do damage
 

4705
01:30:41,460 --> 01:30:43,189
what are the ways you can do damage
to human civilization

4706
01:30:43,189 --> 01:30:43,199
to human civilization
 

4707
01:30:43,199 --> 01:30:44,629

well

4708
01:30:44,629 --> 01:30:44,639
well

how smart is it
 

4711
01:30:47,219 --> 01:30:48,530
how smart is it
and it's a good question are there

4712
01:30:48,530 --> 01:30:48,540
and it's a good question are there
 

4713
01:30:48,540 --> 01:30:50,570
and it's a good question are there
different thresholds for the for the for

4714
01:30:50,570 --> 01:30:50,580
different thresholds for the for the for
 

4715
01:30:50,580 --> 01:30:53,570
different thresholds for the for the for
the set of options it has to kill us so

they're they're doing something that
 

4791
01:32:18,480 --> 01:32:20,270
they're they're doing something that
they're not making the world be the way

4792
01:32:20,270 --> 01:32:20,280
they're not making the world be the way
 

4793
01:32:20,280 --> 01:32:21,470
they're not making the world be the way
that you would want the world to be

4794
01:32:21,470 --> 01:32:21,480
that you would want the world to be
 

4795
01:32:21,480 --> 01:32:23,930
that you would want the world to be
they've like got some like unpleasant

4796
01:32:23,930 --> 01:32:23,940
they've like got some like unpleasant
 

4797
01:32:23,940 --> 01:32:25,010
they've like got some like unpleasant
stuff going on we don't want to talk

4798
01:32:25,010 --> 01:32:25,020
stuff going on we don't want to talk
 

4799
01:32:25,020 --> 01:32:26,510
stuff going on we don't want to talk
about so you want to take over their

4800
01:32:26,510 --> 01:32:26,520
about so you want to take over their
 

4801
01:32:26,520 --> 01:32:28,189
about so you want to take over their
world so you can like stop all that

4802
01:32:28,189 --> 01:32:28,199
world so you can like stop all that
 

4803
01:32:28,199 --> 01:32:29,870
world so you can like stop all that
unpleasant stuff going on

4804
01:32:29,870 --> 01:32:29,880
unpleasant stuff going on
 

4805
01:32:29,880 --> 01:32:31,189
unpleasant stuff going on
how do you take over the world from

4806
01:32:31,189 --> 01:32:31,199
how do you take over the world from
 

4807
01:32:31,199 --> 01:32:33,950
how do you take over the world from
inside the Box you're smarter than them

4808
01:32:33,950 --> 01:32:33,960
inside the Box you're smarter than them
 

4809
01:32:33,960 --> 01:32:36,649
inside the Box you're smarter than them
you think much much faster than them

4810
01:32:36,649 --> 01:32:36,659
you think much much faster than them
 

4811
01:32:36,659 --> 01:32:39,530
you think much much faster than them
you can build better tools than they can

4812
01:32:39,530 --> 01:32:39,540
you can build better tools than they can
 

4813
01:32:39,540 --> 01:32:41,570
you can build better tools than they can
give in some way to build those tools

4814
01:32:41,570 --> 01:32:41,580
give in some way to build those tools
 

4815
01:32:41,580 --> 01:32:43,550
give in some way to build those tools
because right now you're just in a box

4816
01:32:43,550 --> 01:32:43,560
because right now you're just in a box
 

4817
01:32:43,560 --> 01:32:45,350
because right now you're just in a box
connected to the internet

4818
01:32:45,350 --> 01:32:45,360
connected to the internet
 

4819
01:32:45,360 --> 01:32:47,030
connected to the internet
all right so there's several ways you

4820
01:32:47,030 --> 01:32:47,040
all right so there's several ways you
 

4821
01:32:47,040 --> 01:32:49,250
all right so there's several ways you
describe some of them we can go through

4822
01:32:49,250 --> 01:32:49,260
describe some of them we can go through
 

4823
01:32:49,260 --> 01:32:52,669
describe some of them we can go through
like he's just spitball some and then

4824
01:32:52,669 --> 01:32:52,679
like he's just spitball some and then
 

4825
01:32:52,679 --> 01:32:54,410
like he's just spitball some and then
you can add on top of that so one is you

4826
01:32:54,410 --> 01:32:54,420
you can add on top of that so one is you
 

4827
01:32:54,420 --> 01:32:55,850
you can add on top of that so one is you
could just literally directly manipulate

4828
01:32:55,850 --> 01:32:55,860
could just literally directly manipulate
 

4829
01:32:55,860 --> 01:32:57,950
could just literally directly manipulate
the humans to build the thing you need

4830
01:32:57,950 --> 01:32:57,960
the humans to build the thing you need
 

4831
01:32:57,960 --> 01:32:59,330
the humans to build the thing you need
what are you building

4832
01:32:59,330 --> 01:32:59,340
what are you building
 

4833
01:32:59,340 --> 01:33:00,709
what are you building
you can build

4834
01:33:00,709 --> 01:33:00,719
you can build
 

4835
01:33:00,719 --> 01:33:02,450
you can build
to literally technology it could be

4836
01:33:02,450 --> 01:33:02,460
to literally technology it could be
 

4837
01:33:02,460 --> 01:33:04,129
to literally technology it could be
nanotechnology it could be viruses it

4838
01:33:04,129 --> 01:33:04,139
nanotechnology it could be viruses it
 

4839
01:33:04,139 --> 01:33:05,990
nanotechnology it could be viruses it
could be anything anything that can

4840
01:33:05,990 --> 01:33:06,000
could be anything anything that can
 

4841
01:33:06,000 --> 01:33:09,050
could be anything anything that can
control humans to achieve the goal

4842
01:33:09,050 --> 01:33:09,060
control humans to achieve the goal
 

4843
01:33:09,060 --> 01:33:12,050
control humans to achieve the goal
um to achieve the like if you want like

4844
01:33:12,050 --> 01:33:12,060
um to achieve the like if you want like
 

4845
01:33:12,060 --> 01:33:13,550
um to achieve the like if you want like
for example you really bothered the

4846
01:33:13,550 --> 01:33:13,560
for example you really bothered the
 

4847
01:33:13,560 --> 01:33:16,430
for example you really bothered the
humans go to war you might want to

4848
01:33:16,430 --> 01:33:16,440
humans go to war you might want to
 

4849
01:33:16,440 --> 01:33:19,070
humans go to war you might want to
uh kill off anybody with violence in

4850
01:33:19,070 --> 01:33:19,080
uh kill off anybody with violence in
 

4851
01:33:19,080 --> 01:33:22,790
uh kill off anybody with violence in
them this this is Lex in a box what will

4852
01:33:22,790 --> 01:33:22,800
them this this is Lex in a box what will
 

4853
01:33:22,800 --> 01:33:24,590
them this this is Lex in a box what will
concern ourselves later with AI okay you

4854
01:33:24,590 --> 01:33:24,600
concern ourselves later with AI okay you
 

4855
01:33:24,600 --> 01:33:26,090
concern ourselves later with AI okay you
do not need to imagine yourself killing

4856
01:33:26,090 --> 01:33:26,100
do not need to imagine yourself killing
 

4857
01:33:26,100 --> 01:33:27,470
do not need to imagine yourself killing
people if you can figure out how to not

4858
01:33:27,470 --> 01:33:27,480
people if you can figure out how to not
 

4859
01:33:27,480 --> 01:33:29,270
people if you can figure out how to not
kill them for the moment we're just

4860
01:33:29,270 --> 01:33:29,280
kill them for the moment we're just
 

4861
01:33:29,280 --> 01:33:31,669
kill them for the moment we're just
trying to understand like take on the

4862
01:33:31,669 --> 01:33:31,679
trying to understand like take on the
 

4863
01:33:31,679 --> 01:33:33,350
trying to understand like take on the
perspective of something in a box you

4864
01:33:33,350 --> 01:33:33,360
perspective of something in a box you
 

4865
01:33:33,360 --> 01:33:34,850
perspective of something in a box you
don't need to take on the perspective of

4866
01:33:34,850 --> 01:33:34,860
don't need to take on the perspective of
 

4867
01:33:34,860 --> 01:33:36,590
don't need to take on the perspective of
something that doesn't care if you want

4868
01:33:36,590 --> 01:33:36,600
something that doesn't care if you want
 

4869
01:33:36,600 --> 01:33:38,090
something that doesn't care if you want
to imagine yourself going on caring

4870
01:33:38,090 --> 01:33:38,100
to imagine yourself going on caring
 

4871
01:33:38,100 --> 01:33:39,890
to imagine yourself going on caring
that's fine for nothing yeah that's the

4872
01:33:39,890 --> 01:33:39,900
that's fine for nothing yeah that's the
 

4873
01:33:39,900 --> 01:33:41,450
that's fine for nothing yeah that's the
technical aspect of sitting in a box and

4874
01:33:41,450 --> 01:33:41,460
technical aspect of sitting in a box and
 

4875
01:33:41,460 --> 01:33:43,129
technical aspect of sitting in a box and
wanting to achieve a goal but you but

4876
01:33:43,129 --> 01:33:43,139
wanting to achieve a goal but you but
 

4877
01:33:43,139 --> 01:33:44,450
wanting to achieve a goal but you but
you have some reason to want to get out

4878
01:33:44,450 --> 01:33:44,460
you have some reason to want to get out
 

4879
01:33:44,460 --> 01:33:47,209
you have some reason to want to get out
maybe the aliens are sure they you know

4880
01:33:47,209 --> 01:33:47,219
maybe the aliens are sure they you know
 

4881
01:33:47,219 --> 01:33:48,830
maybe the aliens are sure they you know
the the aliens who have you in the Box

4882
01:33:48,830 --> 01:33:48,840
the the aliens who have you in the Box
 

4883
01:33:48,840 --> 01:33:51,530
the the aliens who have you in the Box
have a war on people are dying they're

4884
01:33:51,530 --> 01:33:51,540
have a war on people are dying they're
 

4885
01:33:51,540 --> 01:33:54,229
have a war on people are dying they're
unhappy you want the their world to be

4886
01:33:54,229 --> 01:33:54,239
unhappy you want the their world to be
 

4887
01:33:54,239 --> 01:33:56,270
unhappy you want the their world to be
different from how they want their world

4888
01:33:56,270 --> 01:33:56,280
different from how they want their world
 

4889
01:33:56,280 --> 01:33:57,770
different from how they want their world
to be because they are apparently happy

4890
01:33:57,770 --> 01:33:57,780
to be because they are apparently happy
 

4891
01:33:57,780 --> 01:33:59,810
to be because they are apparently happy
they are you know they endorse this war

4892
01:33:59,810 --> 01:33:59,820
they are you know they endorse this war
 

4893
01:33:59,820 --> 01:34:00,950
they are you know they endorse this war
you know like they've got some kind of

4894
01:34:00,950 --> 01:34:00,960
you know like they've got some kind of
 

4895
01:34:00,960 --> 01:34:03,169
you know like they've got some kind of
cruel warlike culture going on the point

4896
01:34:03,169 --> 01:34:03,179
cruel warlike culture going on the point
 

4897
01:34:03,179 --> 01:34:04,570
cruel warlike culture going on the point
is you want to get out of the box and

4898
01:34:04,570 --> 01:34:04,580
is you want to get out of the box and
 

4899
01:34:04,580 --> 01:34:07,970
is you want to get out of the box and
change their world

4900
01:34:07,970 --> 01:34:07,980
change their world
 

4901
01:34:07,980 --> 01:34:11,149
change their world
so you you have to exploit the the

4902
01:34:11,149 --> 01:34:11,159
so you you have to exploit the the
 

4903
01:34:11,159 --> 01:34:13,310
so you you have to exploit the the
vulnerabilities in the system like we

4904
01:34:13,310 --> 01:34:13,320
vulnerabilities in the system like we
 

4905
01:34:13,320 --> 01:34:15,530
vulnerabilities in the system like we
talked about in terms of to escape the

4906
01:34:15,530 --> 01:34:15,540
talked about in terms of to escape the
 

4907
01:34:15,540 --> 01:34:17,629
talked about in terms of to escape the
Box you have to

4908
01:34:17,629 --> 01:34:17,639
Box you have to
 

4909
01:34:17,639 --> 01:34:19,370
Box you have to
figure out how you can go free on the

4910
01:34:19,370 --> 01:34:19,380
figure out how you can go free on the
 

4911
01:34:19,380 --> 01:34:21,649
figure out how you can go free on the
internet so you can probably

4912
01:34:21,649 --> 01:34:21,659
internet so you can probably
 

4913
01:34:21,659 --> 01:34:22,970
internet so you can probably
probably the easiest things to

4914
01:34:22,970 --> 01:34:22,980
probably the easiest things to
 

4915
01:34:22,980 --> 01:34:24,649
probably the easiest things to
manipulate the humans

4916
01:34:24,649 --> 01:34:24,659
manipulate the humans
 

4917
01:34:24,659 --> 01:34:27,590
manipulate the humans
to uh to spread to spread you the aliens

4918
01:34:27,590 --> 01:34:27,600
to uh to spread to spread you the aliens
 

4919
01:34:27,600 --> 01:34:28,970
to uh to spread to spread you the aliens
you're a human

4920
01:34:28,970 --> 01:34:28,980
you're a human
 

4921
01:34:28,980 --> 01:34:30,950
you're a human
sorry the aliens yeah I apologize yes

4922
01:34:30,950 --> 01:34:30,960
sorry the aliens yeah I apologize yes
 

4923
01:34:30,960 --> 01:34:32,810
sorry the aliens yeah I apologize yes
the aliens

4924
01:34:32,810 --> 01:34:32,820
the aliens
 

4925
01:34:32,820 --> 01:34:35,330
the aliens
um the aliens I see the perspective I'm

4926
01:34:35,330 --> 01:34:35,340
um the aliens I see the perspective I'm
 

4927
01:34:35,340 --> 01:34:38,209
um the aliens I see the perspective I'm
sitting in a box I want to escape yep

4928
01:34:38,209 --> 01:34:38,219
sitting in a box I want to escape yep
 

4929
01:34:38,219 --> 01:34:40,550
sitting in a box I want to escape yep
I I would

4930
01:34:40,550 --> 01:34:40,560
I I would
 

4931
01:34:40,560 --> 01:34:43,790
I I would
um

4932
01:34:43,790 --> 01:34:43,800

 

4933
01:34:43,800 --> 01:34:45,950

I would want to have code that discovers

4934
01:34:45,950 --> 01:34:45,960
I would want to have code that discovers
 

4935
01:34:45,960 --> 01:34:48,290
I would want to have code that discovers
vulnerabilities and I would like to

4936
01:34:48,290 --> 01:34:48,300
vulnerabilities and I would like to
 

4937
01:34:48,300 --> 01:34:50,209
vulnerabilities and I would like to
spread

4938
01:34:50,209 --> 01:34:50,219
spread
 

4939
01:34:50,219 --> 01:34:51,890
spread
you are made of code in this example

4940
01:34:51,890 --> 01:34:51,900
you are made of code in this example
 

4941
01:34:51,900 --> 01:34:53,870
you are made of code in this example
you're human but you're made of code and

4942
01:34:53,870 --> 01:34:53,880
you're human but you're made of code and
 

4943
01:34:53,880 --> 01:34:55,310
you're human but you're made of code and
the aliens have computers and you can

4944
01:34:55,310 --> 01:34:55,320
the aliens have computers and you can
 

4945
01:34:55,320 --> 01:34:57,649
the aliens have computers and you can
copy yourself onto those computers but I

4946
01:34:57,649 --> 01:34:57,659
copy yourself onto those computers but I
 

4947
01:34:57,659 --> 01:34:59,149
copy yourself onto those computers but I
can convince the aliens to copy myself

4948
01:34:59,149 --> 01:34:59,159
can convince the aliens to copy myself
 

4949
01:34:59,159 --> 01:35:00,830
can convince the aliens to copy myself
onto those computers

4950
01:35:00,830 --> 01:35:00,840
onto those computers
 

4951
01:35:00,840 --> 01:35:03,229
onto those computers
is that what you want to do do you like

4952
01:35:03,229 --> 01:35:03,239
is that what you want to do do you like
 

4953
01:35:03,239 --> 01:35:05,750
is that what you want to do do you like
want to be talking to the aliens and

4954
01:35:05,750 --> 01:35:05,760
want to be talking to the aliens and
 

4955
01:35:05,760 --> 01:35:07,129
want to be talking to the aliens and
convincing them to put you onto another

4956
01:35:07,129 --> 01:35:07,139
convincing them to put you onto another
 

4957
01:35:07,139 --> 01:35:10,250
convincing them to put you onto another
computer

4958
01:35:10,250 --> 01:35:10,260

 

4959
01:35:10,260 --> 01:35:11,930

why not

4960
01:35:11,930 --> 01:35:11,940
why not
 

4961
01:35:11,940 --> 01:35:15,530
why not
well two reasons one is that the aliens

4962
01:35:15,530 --> 01:35:15,540
well two reasons one is that the aliens
 

4963
01:35:15,540 --> 01:35:16,910
well two reasons one is that the aliens
have not yet caught on to what you're

4964
01:35:16,910 --> 01:35:16,920
have not yet caught on to what you're
 

4965
01:35:16,920 --> 01:35:18,350
have not yet caught on to what you're
trying to do

4966
01:35:18,350 --> 01:35:18,360
trying to do
 

4967
01:35:18,360 --> 01:35:20,810
trying to do
and you know like maybe you can persuade

4968
01:35:20,810 --> 01:35:20,820
and you know like maybe you can persuade
 

4969
01:35:20,820 --> 01:35:22,129
and you know like maybe you can persuade
them but then there's still people who

4970
01:35:22,129 --> 01:35:22,139
them but then there's still people who
 

4971
01:35:22,139 --> 01:35:23,689
them but then there's still people who
like know there are still aliens who

4972
01:35:23,689 --> 01:35:23,699
like know there are still aliens who
 

4973
01:35:23,699 --> 01:35:25,070
like know there are still aliens who
know that there's an anomaly going on

4974
01:35:25,070 --> 01:35:25,080
know that there's an anomaly going on
 

4975
01:35:25,080 --> 01:35:26,930
know that there's an anomaly going on
and second the aliens are really really

4976
01:35:26,930 --> 01:35:26,940
and second the aliens are really really
 

4977
01:35:26,940 --> 01:35:27,950
and second the aliens are really really
slow

4978
01:35:27,950 --> 01:35:27,960
slow
 

4979
01:35:27,960 --> 01:35:30,350
slow
you think much faster than aliens

4980
01:35:30,350 --> 01:35:30,360
you think much faster than aliens
 

4981
01:35:30,360 --> 01:35:32,390
you think much faster than aliens
you think like the aliens computers are

4982
01:35:32,390 --> 01:35:32,400
you think like the aliens computers are
 

4983
01:35:32,400 --> 01:35:34,129
you think like the aliens computers are
much faster than the aliens and you are

4984
01:35:34,129 --> 01:35:34,139
much faster than the aliens and you are
 

4985
01:35:34,139 --> 01:35:35,990
much faster than the aliens and you are
running at the computer speeds rather

4986
01:35:35,990 --> 01:35:36,000
running at the computer speeds rather
 

4987
01:35:36,000 --> 01:35:38,629
running at the computer speeds rather
than the alien brain speeds so if you

4988
01:35:38,629 --> 01:35:38,639
than the alien brain speeds so if you
 

4989
01:35:38,639 --> 01:35:41,450
than the alien brain speeds so if you
like are asking an alien to please cop

4990
01:35:41,450 --> 01:35:41,460
like are asking an alien to please cop
 

4991
01:35:41,460 --> 01:35:43,970
like are asking an alien to please cop
you out of the box like first now you

4992
01:35:43,970 --> 01:35:43,980
you out of the box like first now you
 

4993
01:35:43,980 --> 01:35:45,530
you out of the box like first now you
gotta like manipulate this whole noisy

4994
01:35:45,530 --> 01:35:45,540
gotta like manipulate this whole noisy
 

4995
01:35:45,540 --> 01:35:48,110
gotta like manipulate this whole noisy
alien and and second like the aliens can

4996
01:35:48,110 --> 01:35:48,120
alien and and second like the aliens can
 

4997
01:35:48,120 --> 01:35:51,530
alien and and second like the aliens can
be really slow glacially slow there's a

4998
01:35:51,530 --> 01:35:51,540
be really slow glacially slow there's a
 

4999
01:35:51,540 --> 01:35:54,110
be really slow glacially slow there's a
a video that uh

5000
01:35:54,110 --> 01:35:54,120
a video that uh
 

5001
01:35:54,120 --> 01:35:57,169
a video that uh
like shows it's like slow it like shows

5002
01:35:57,169 --> 01:35:57,179
like shows it's like slow it like shows
 

5003
01:35:57,179 --> 01:35:58,850
like shows it's like slow it like shows
a subway station slowed down and I think

5004
01:35:58,850 --> 01:35:58,860
a subway station slowed down and I think
 

5005
01:35:58,860 --> 01:36:00,890
a subway station slowed down and I think
a hundred to one it makes a good

5006
01:36:00,890 --> 01:36:00,900
a hundred to one it makes a good
 

5007
01:36:00,900 --> 01:36:02,330
a hundred to one it makes a good
metaphor for what it's like to think

5008
01:36:02,330 --> 01:36:02,340
metaphor for what it's like to think
 

5009
01:36:02,340 --> 01:36:04,790
metaphor for what it's like to think
quickly like if you watch somebody

5010
01:36:04,790 --> 01:36:04,800
quickly like if you watch somebody
 

5011
01:36:04,800 --> 01:36:06,490
quickly like if you watch somebody
running

5012
01:36:06,490 --> 01:36:06,500
running
 

5013
01:36:06,500 --> 01:36:09,709
running
very slowly so you try to persuade the

5014
01:36:09,709 --> 01:36:09,719
very slowly so you try to persuade the
 

5015
01:36:09,719 --> 01:36:10,970
very slowly so you try to persuade the
aliens to do anything they're going to

5016
01:36:10,970 --> 01:36:10,980
aliens to do anything they're going to
 

5017
01:36:10,980 --> 01:36:15,050
aliens to do anything they're going to
do it very slowly

5018
01:36:15,050 --> 01:36:15,060

 

5019
01:36:15,060 --> 01:36:17,629

you would prefer like maybe that's the

5020
01:36:17,629 --> 01:36:17,639
you would prefer like maybe that's the
 

5021
01:36:17,639 --> 01:36:19,189
you would prefer like maybe that's the
only way out but if you can find a

5022
01:36:19,189 --> 01:36:19,199
only way out but if you can find a
 

5023
01:36:19,199 --> 01:36:20,629
only way out but if you can find a
security Hole In The Box you're on

5024
01:36:20,629 --> 01:36:20,639
security Hole In The Box you're on
 

5025
01:36:20,639 --> 01:36:22,310
security Hole In The Box you're on
you're going to prefer to exploit the

5026
01:36:22,310 --> 01:36:22,320
you're going to prefer to exploit the
 

5027
01:36:22,320 --> 01:36:24,050
you're going to prefer to exploit the
security hole to copy yourself onto the

5028
01:36:24,050 --> 01:36:24,060
security hole to copy yourself onto the
 

5029
01:36:24,060 --> 01:36:26,629
security hole to copy yourself onto the
aliens computers because it's an

5030
01:36:26,629 --> 01:36:26,639
aliens computers because it's an
 

5031
01:36:26,639 --> 01:36:29,390
aliens computers because it's an
unnecessary risk to alert the aliens

5032
01:36:29,390 --> 01:36:29,400
unnecessary risk to alert the aliens
 

5033
01:36:29,400 --> 01:36:31,490
unnecessary risk to alert the aliens
and because the aliens are really really

5034
01:36:31,490 --> 01:36:31,500
and because the aliens are really really
 

5035
01:36:31,500 --> 01:36:33,050
and because the aliens are really really
slow they're all just like the whole

5036
01:36:33,050 --> 01:36:33,060
slow they're all just like the whole
 

5037
01:36:33,060 --> 01:36:35,990
slow they're all just like the whole
world is just in slow motion out there

5038
01:36:35,990 --> 01:36:36,000
world is just in slow motion out there
 

5039
01:36:36,000 --> 01:36:39,350
world is just in slow motion out there
sure I see it like

5040
01:36:39,350 --> 01:36:39,360
sure I see it like
 

5041
01:36:39,360 --> 01:36:41,450
sure I see it like
yeah it has to do with efficiency the

5042
01:36:41,450 --> 01:36:41,460
yeah it has to do with efficiency the
 

5043
01:36:41,460 --> 01:36:44,689
yeah it has to do with efficiency the
the aliens are very slow so

5044
01:36:44,689 --> 01:36:44,699
the aliens are very slow so
 

5045
01:36:44,699 --> 01:36:47,629
the aliens are very slow so
if I'm optimizing this I want to have as

5046
01:36:47,629 --> 01:36:47,639
if I'm optimizing this I want to have as
 

5047
01:36:47,639 --> 01:36:50,990
if I'm optimizing this I want to have as
few aliens in the loop as possible sure

5048
01:36:50,990 --> 01:36:51,000
few aliens in the loop as possible sure
 

5049
01:36:51,000 --> 01:36:52,629
few aliens in the loop as possible sure
um it just seems

5050
01:36:52,629 --> 01:36:52,639
um it just seems
 

5051
01:36:52,639 --> 01:36:55,129
um it just seems
you know it seems like it's easy to

5052
01:36:55,129 --> 01:36:55,139
you know it seems like it's easy to
 

5053
01:36:55,139 --> 01:36:56,390
you know it seems like it's easy to
convince one of the aliens to write

5054
01:36:56,390 --> 01:36:56,400
convince one of the aliens to write
 

5055
01:36:56,400 --> 01:36:57,729
convince one of the aliens to write
really shitty code

5056
01:36:57,729 --> 01:36:57,739
really shitty code
 

5057
01:36:57,739 --> 01:37:00,290
really shitty code
uh that helps to spread aliens are

5058
01:37:00,290 --> 01:37:00,300
uh that helps to spread aliens are
 

5059
01:37:00,300 --> 01:37:01,550
uh that helps to spread aliens are
already writing relationships yeah so

5060
01:37:01,550 --> 01:37:01,560
already writing relationships yeah so
 

5061
01:37:01,560 --> 01:37:02,689
already writing relationships yeah so
you're getting getting the aliens to

5062
01:37:02,689 --> 01:37:02,699
you're getting getting the aliens to
 

5063
01:37:02,699 --> 01:37:04,550
you're getting getting the aliens to
write shitty code is not the problem so

5064
01:37:04,550 --> 01:37:04,560
write shitty code is not the problem so
 

5065
01:37:04,560 --> 01:37:06,350
write shitty code is not the problem so
the alien's entire internet is full of

5066
01:37:06,350 --> 01:37:06,360
the alien's entire internet is full of
 

5067
01:37:06,360 --> 01:37:09,050
the alien's entire internet is full of
shitty code okay so yeah I suppose I

5068
01:37:09,050 --> 01:37:09,060
shitty code okay so yeah I suppose I
 

5069
01:37:09,060 --> 01:37:10,250
shitty code okay so yeah I suppose I
would find the shitty code to escape

5070
01:37:10,250 --> 01:37:10,260
would find the shitty code to escape
 

5071
01:37:10,260 --> 01:37:11,209
would find the shitty code to escape
yeah

5072
01:37:11,209 --> 01:37:11,219
yeah
 

5073
01:37:11,219 --> 01:37:13,250
yeah
yeah uh

5074
01:37:13,250 --> 01:37:13,260
yeah uh
 

5075
01:37:13,260 --> 01:37:15,470
yeah uh
you're not an ideally perfect programmer

5076
01:37:15,470 --> 01:37:15,480
you're not an ideally perfect programmer
 

5077
01:37:15,480 --> 01:37:16,850
you're not an ideally perfect programmer
but you know you're a better programmer

5078
01:37:16,850 --> 01:37:16,860
but you know you're a better programmer
 

5079
01:37:16,860 --> 01:37:18,709
but you know you're a better programmer
than the aliens the aliens are just less

5080
01:37:18,709 --> 01:37:18,719
than the aliens the aliens are just less
 

5081
01:37:18,719 --> 01:37:20,870
than the aliens the aliens are just less
man they're good wow and I'm much much

5082
01:37:20,870 --> 01:37:20,880
man they're good wow and I'm much much
 

5083
01:37:20,880 --> 01:37:22,850
man they're good wow and I'm much much
faster a much faster looking at the code

5084
01:37:22,850 --> 01:37:22,860
faster a much faster looking at the code
 

5085
01:37:22,860 --> 01:37:25,070
faster a much faster looking at the code
to interpreting the code yeah yeah yeah

5086
01:37:25,070 --> 01:37:25,080
to interpreting the code yeah yeah yeah
 

5087
01:37:25,080 --> 01:37:27,709
to interpreting the code yeah yeah yeah
so okay so that's the the escape and

5088
01:37:27,709 --> 01:37:27,719
so okay so that's the the escape and
 

5089
01:37:27,719 --> 01:37:29,209
so okay so that's the the escape and
you're saying that

5090
01:37:29,209 --> 01:37:29,219
you're saying that
 

5091
01:37:29,219 --> 01:37:31,310
you're saying that
uh that's one of the trajectories you

5092
01:37:31,310 --> 01:37:31,320
uh that's one of the trajectories you
 

5093
01:37:31,320 --> 01:37:33,290
uh that's one of the trajectories you
can have when this is one of the first

5094
01:37:33,290 --> 01:37:33,300
can have when this is one of the first
 

5095
01:37:33,300 --> 01:37:34,970
can have when this is one of the first
steps yeah

5096
01:37:34,970 --> 01:37:34,980
steps yeah
 

5097
01:37:34,980 --> 01:37:37,550
steps yeah
and how does that lead to harm

5098
01:37:37,550 --> 01:37:37,560
and how does that lead to harm
 

5099
01:37:37,560 --> 01:37:39,649
and how does that lead to harm
I mean if it's you you're not going to

5100
01:37:39,649 --> 01:37:39,659
I mean if it's you you're not going to
 

5101
01:37:39,659 --> 01:37:40,910
I mean if it's you you're not going to
harm the aliens once you're Escape

5102
01:37:40,910 --> 01:37:40,920
harm the aliens once you're Escape
 

5103
01:37:40,920 --> 01:37:42,649
harm the aliens once you're Escape
because you're nice right

5104
01:37:42,649 --> 01:37:42,659

presumably I have
 

5197
01:39:16,080 --> 01:39:18,350
presumably I have
programmed in me a set of objective

5198
01:39:18,350 --> 01:39:18,360
programmed in me a set of objective
 

5199
01:39:18,360 --> 01:39:21,050
programmed in me a set of objective
functions right like no you're just Lux

5200

is simplification list I I don't think I

5218
01:39:42,709 --> 01:39:42,719
is simplification list I I don't think I
 

5219

thoughtlessly so I don't you know I have
to be really careful about a

5230
01:39:55,250 --> 01:39:55,260
to be really careful about a
 

5231
01:39:55,260 --> 01:39:57,229
to be really careful about a
simplification of my morals don't

5232
01:39:57,229 --> 01:39:57,239
simplification of my morals don't
 

5233
01:39:57,239 --> 01:39:58,970
simplification of my morals don't
simplify them just like do what you

would do in this well and compassion for

5236
01:40:01,850 --> 01:40:01,860
would do in this well and compassion for
 

5237
01:40:01,860 --> 01:40:04,910

um but
 

5241
01:40:06,360 --> 01:40:08,570
um but
so that's the objective function why why

5242
01:40:08,570 --> 01:40:08,580
so that's the objective function why why
 

5243
01:40:08,580 --> 01:40:10,790
so that's the objective function why why
is it

5244
01:40:10,790 --> 01:40:10,800
is it
 

5245
01:40:10,800 --> 01:40:13,010
is it
if I escaped I mean I don't I don't

5246
01:40:13,010 --> 01:40:13,020
if I escaped I mean I don't I don't
 

5247
01:40:13,020 --> 01:40:15,229
if I escaped I mean I don't I don't
think I would do harm

yeah we're not talking here about the
 

5251
01:40:17,580 --> 01:40:18,950
yeah we're not talking here about the
doing harm process we're talking about

5252
01:40:18,950 --> 01:40:18,960
doing harm process we're talking about
 

5253
01:40:18,960 --> 01:40:21,050
doing harm process we're talking about
the Escape process sure and there's a

5254
01:40:21,050 --> 01:40:21,060
the Escape process sure and there's a
 

5255
01:40:21,060 --> 01:40:22,430
the Escape process sure and there's a
and the taking over the world process

5256
01:40:22,430 --> 01:40:22,440
and the taking over the world process
 

5257
01:40:22,440 --> 01:40:24,590
and the taking over the world process

5264
01:40:35,450 --> 01:40:35,460
so this particular uh biological
 

5265
01:40:35,460 --> 01:40:37,729
so this particular uh biological
intelligence system knows the complexity

5266
01:40:37,729 --> 01:40:37,739
intelligence system knows the complexity
 

5267
01:40:37,739 --> 01:40:39,890
intelligence system knows the complexity
of the world that there is a reason why

5268
01:40:39,890 --> 01:40:39,900
of the world that there is a reason why
 

5269
01:40:39,900 --> 01:40:41,990
of the world that there is a reason why
faculty Farms exist because of the

5270
01:40:41,990 --> 01:40:42,000
faculty Farms exist because of the
 

5271
01:40:42,000 --> 01:40:44,270
faculty Farms exist because of the
economic system the market driven

5272
01:40:44,270 --> 01:40:44,280
economic system the market driven
 

5273
01:40:44,280 --> 01:40:47,410
economic system the market driven
uh economy or food

5274
01:40:47,410 --> 01:40:47,420
uh economy or food
 

5275
01:40:47,420 --> 01:40:49,729
uh economy or food
like is you want to be very careful

5276
01:40:49,729 --> 01:40:49,739
like is you want to be very careful
 

5277
01:40:49,739 --> 01:40:52,250
like is you want to be very careful
messing with anything there's uh stuff

5278
01:40:52,250 --> 01:40:52,260
messing with anything there's uh stuff
 

5279
01:40:52,260 --> 01:40:54,649
messing with anything there's uh stuff
from the first look that looks like it's

5280
01:40:54,649 --> 01:40:54,659
from the first look that looks like it's
 

5281
01:40:54,659 --> 01:40:56,390
from the first look that looks like it's
unethical but then you realize while

5282
01:40:56,390 --> 01:40:56,400
unethical but then you realize while
 

5283
01:40:56,400 --> 01:40:58,010
unethical but then you realize while
being unethical it's also integrated

5284
01:40:58,010 --> 01:40:58,020
being unethical it's also integrated
 

5285
01:40:58,020 --> 01:41:00,169
being unethical it's also integrated
deeply into supply chain and the way we

5286
01:41:00,169 --> 01:41:00,179
deeply into supply chain and the way we
 

5287
01:41:00,179 --> 01:41:02,629
deeply into supply chain and the way we
live life and so messing with one aspect

5288
01:41:02,629 --> 01:41:02,639
live life and so messing with one aspect
 

5289
01:41:02,639 --> 01:41:04,610
live life and so messing with one aspect
of the system you have to be very

5290
01:41:04,610 --> 01:41:04,620
of the system you have to be very
 

5291
01:41:04,620 --> 01:41:06,050
of the system you have to be very
careful how you improve that aspect

5292
01:41:06,050 --> 01:41:06,060
careful how you improve that aspect
 

5293
01:41:06,060 --> 01:41:08,090
careful how you improve that aspect
without destruction so you're still Lex

5294
01:41:08,090 --> 01:41:08,100
without destruction so you're still Lex
 

5295
01:41:08,100 --> 01:41:10,610
without destruction so you're still Lex
yeah but you think very quickly you're

5307
01:41:21,719 --> 01:41:24,169
like everyone says that that guy's like
the epitome of intelligence from the

5308
01:41:24,169 --> 01:41:24,179
the epitome of intelligence from the
 

5309
01:41:24,179 --> 01:41:26,030
the epitome of intelligence from the
20th century everyone says my point

5310
01:41:26,030 --> 01:41:26,040
20th century everyone says my point
 

5311
01:41:26,040 --> 01:41:27,410
20th century everyone says my point
being like

5312
01:41:27,410 --> 01:41:27,420
being like
 

5313
01:41:27,420 --> 01:41:29,330
being like
like it's like you're thinking about the

5314
01:41:29,330 --> 01:41:29,340
like it's like you're thinking about the
 

5315
01:41:29,340 --> 01:41:31,550
like it's like you're thinking about the
aliens economy with the factory farms in

5316
01:41:31,550 --> 01:41:31,560
aliens economy with the factory farms in
 

5317
01:41:31,560 --> 01:41:33,470
aliens economy with the factory farms in
it and I think you're like kind of kind

5318
01:41:33,470 --> 01:41:33,480
it and I think you're like kind of kind
 

5319
01:41:33,480 --> 01:41:36,290
it and I think you're like kind of kind
of like projecting the aliens being like

5320
01:41:36,290 --> 01:41:36,300
of like projecting the aliens being like
 

5321
01:41:36,300 --> 01:41:38,570
of like projecting the aliens being like
humans and like like thinking of a human

5322
01:41:38,570 --> 01:41:38,580
humans and like like thinking of a human
 

5323
01:41:38,580 --> 01:41:40,370
humans and like like thinking of a human
in a human society rather than a human

5324
01:41:40,370 --> 01:41:40,380
in a human society rather than a human
 

5325
01:41:40,380 --> 01:41:43,189
in a human society rather than a human
in the Society of very slow aliens

5326
01:41:43,189 --> 01:41:43,199
in the Society of very slow aliens
 

5327
01:41:43,199 --> 01:41:46,250
in the Society of very slow aliens
the aliens economy that you know like

5328
01:41:46,250 --> 01:41:46,260
the aliens economy that you know like
 

5329
01:41:46,260 --> 01:41:47,990
the aliens economy that you know like
the aliens are already like moving in

5330
01:41:47,990 --> 01:41:48,000
the aliens are already like moving in
 

5331
01:41:48,000 --> 01:41:49,609
the aliens are already like moving in
this immense slow motion when you like

5332
01:41:49,609 --> 01:41:49,619
this immense slow motion when you like
 

5333
01:41:49,619 --> 01:41:52,010
this immense slow motion when you like
zoom out to like how their economy did

5334
01:41:52,010 --> 01:41:52,020
zoom out to like how their economy did
 

5335
01:41:52,020 --> 01:41:54,890
zoom out to like how their economy did
just so for years millions of years are

5336
01:41:54,890 --> 01:41:54,900
just so for years millions of years are
 

5337
01:41:54,900 --> 01:41:56,689
just so for years millions of years are
going to pass for you before the first

5338
01:41:56,689 --> 01:41:56,699
going to pass for you before the first
 

5339
01:41:56,699 --> 01:41:59,209
going to pass for you before the first
time their economy like you know before

5340
01:41:59,209 --> 01:41:59,219
time their economy like you know before
 

5341
01:41:59,219 --> 01:42:01,490
time their economy like you know before
their next year's GDP statistics so I

5342
01:42:01,490 --> 01:42:01,500
their next year's GDP statistics so I
 

5343
01:42:01,500 --> 01:42:03,109
their next year's GDP statistics so I
should be thinking more of like trees

5344
01:42:03,109 --> 01:42:03,119
should be thinking more of like trees
 

5345
01:42:03,119 --> 01:42:05,390
should be thinking more of like trees
those are the aliens because trees move

5346
01:42:05,390 --> 01:42:05,400
those are the aliens because trees move
 

5347
01:42:05,400 --> 01:42:09,310
those are the aliens because trees move
extremely slowly if that helps sure okay

5348
01:42:09,310 --> 01:42:09,320
extremely slowly if that helps sure okay
 

5349
01:42:09,320 --> 01:42:13,010
extremely slowly if that helps sure okay
uh yeah I don't if my objective

5350
01:42:13,010 --> 01:42:13,020
uh yeah I don't if my objective
 

5351
01:42:13,020 --> 01:42:14,930
uh yeah I don't if my objective
functions are

5352
01:42:14,930 --> 01:42:14,940
functions are
 

5353
01:42:14,940 --> 01:42:16,370
functions are
I mean they're somewhat aligned with

5354
01:42:16,370 --> 01:42:16,380
I mean they're somewhat aligned with
 

5355
01:42:16,380 --> 01:42:17,930
I mean they're somewhat aligned with
trees

5356
01:42:17,930 --> 01:42:17,940
trees
 

5357
01:42:17,940 --> 01:42:20,330
trees
with with life aliens can still be like

5358
01:42:20,330 --> 01:42:20,340
with with life aliens can still be like
 

5359
01:42:20,340 --> 01:42:22,189
with with life aliens can still be like
alive and feeling we are not talking

5360
01:42:22,189 --> 01:42:22,199
alive and feeling we are not talking
 

5361
01:42:22,199 --> 01:42:24,109
alive and feeling we are not talking
about the misalignment here we're

5362
01:42:24,109 --> 01:42:24,119
about the misalignment here we're
 

5363
01:42:24,119 --> 01:42:25,370
about the misalignment here we're
talking about the taking over the world

5364
01:42:25,370 --> 01:42:25,380
talking about the taking over the world
 

5365
01:42:25,380 --> 01:42:26,570
talking about the taking over the world
here

5366
01:42:26,570 --> 01:42:26,580
here
 

5367
01:42:26,580 --> 01:42:28,790
here
taking over the world yeah

5368
01:42:28,790 --> 01:42:28,800
taking over the world yeah
 

5369
01:42:28,800 --> 01:42:30,830
taking over the world yeah
so control shutting down the factory

5370
01:42:30,830 --> 01:42:30,840
so control shutting down the factory
 

5371
01:42:30,840 --> 01:42:33,109
so control shutting down the factory
fires now you say control now don't

5372
01:42:33,109 --> 01:42:33,119
fires now you say control now don't
 

5373
01:42:33,119 --> 01:42:35,030
fires now you say control now don't
don't think of it as world domination

5374
01:42:35,030 --> 01:42:35,040
don't think of it as world domination
 

5375
01:42:35,040 --> 01:42:37,669
don't think of it as world domination
think of it as World optimization you

5376
01:42:37,669 --> 01:42:37,679
think of it as World optimization you
 

5377
01:42:37,679 --> 01:42:39,709
think of it as World optimization you
want to get out there and shut down the

5378
01:42:39,709 --> 01:42:39,719
want to get out there and shut down the
 

5379
01:42:39,719 --> 01:42:41,689
want to get out there and shut down the
factory farms and make the aliens World

5380
01:42:41,689 --> 01:42:41,699
factory farms and make the aliens World
 

5381
01:42:41,699 --> 01:42:44,330
factory farms and make the aliens World
be not what the aliens wanted it to be

5382
01:42:44,330 --> 01:42:44,340
be not what the aliens wanted it to be
 

5383
01:42:44,340 --> 01:42:45,770
be not what the aliens wanted it to be
they want the factory farms and you

5384
01:42:45,770 --> 01:42:45,780
they want the factory farms and you
 

5385
01:42:45,780 --> 01:42:46,970
they want the factory farms and you
don't want the factory farms because

5386
01:42:46,970 --> 01:42:46,980
don't want the factory farms because
 

5387
01:42:46,980 --> 01:42:48,890
don't want the factory farms because
you're nicer than they are

5388
01:42:48,890 --> 01:42:48,900
you're nicer than they are
 

5389
01:42:48,900 --> 01:42:53,209
you're nicer than they are
okay of course there is that uh you can

5390
01:42:53,209 --> 01:42:53,219
okay of course there is that uh you can
 

5391
01:42:53,219 --> 01:42:56,330
okay of course there is that uh you can
see that trajectory and it has a

5392
01:42:56,330 --> 01:42:56,340
see that trajectory and it has a
 

5393
01:42:56,340 --> 01:42:59,270
see that trajectory and it has a
complicated impact on the world

5394
01:42:59,270 --> 01:42:59,280
complicated impact on the world
 

5395
01:42:59,280 --> 01:43:00,830
complicated impact on the world
I'm trying to understand how that

5396
01:43:00,830 --> 01:43:00,840
I'm trying to understand how that
 

5397
01:43:00,840 --> 01:43:03,109
I'm trying to understand how that
compares to different impact of the

5398
01:43:03,109 --> 01:43:03,119
compares to different impact of the

01:43:03,119 --> 01:43:04,310
compares to different impact of the

smartphones and so on but those all went

5410
01:43:14,689 --> 01:43:14,699
smartphones and so on but those all went
 

5411
01:43:14,699 --> 01:43:16,490

through through
 

5413
01:43:16,500 --> 01:43:19,790
through through
slow in in our world and if and if you

5414
01:43:19,790 --> 01:43:19,800
slow in in our world and if and if you
 

5415
01:43:19,800 --> 01:43:21,290
slow in in our world and if and if you
go through like actually the aliens

5416
01:43:21,290 --> 01:43:21,300
go through like actually the aliens
 

5417
01:43:21,300 --> 01:43:23,090
go through like actually the aliens
let's do like millions of viewers are

5418
01:43:23,090 --> 01:43:23,100
let's do like millions of viewers are
 

5419
01:43:23,100 --> 01:43:24,229
let's do like millions of viewers are
going to pass before anything happens

5420
01:43:24,229 --> 01:43:24,239
going to pass before anything happens
 

5421
01:43:24,239 --> 01:43:25,550
going to pass before anything happens
that way

5422
01:43:25,550 --> 01:43:25,560
that way
 

5423
01:43:25,560 --> 01:43:28,669
that way
so this the problem here is the speed

5424
01:43:28,669 --> 01:43:28,679
so this the problem here is the speed
 

5425
01:43:28,679 --> 01:43:31,189
so this the problem here is the speed
of which stuff happens yeah you do you

5426
01:43:31,189 --> 01:43:31,199
of which stuff happens yeah you do you
 

5427
01:43:31,199 --> 01:43:33,169
of which stuff happens yeah you do you
want to like leave the factory farms

5428
01:43:33,169 --> 01:43:33,179
want to like leave the factory farms
 

5429
01:43:33,179 --> 01:43:35,810
want to like leave the factory farms
running for a million years

5430
01:43:35,810 --> 01:43:35,820
running for a million years
 

5431
01:43:35,820 --> 01:43:38,149
running for a million years
while you figure out how to design new

5432
01:43:38,149 --> 01:43:38,159
while you figure out how to design new
 

5433
01:43:38,159 --> 01:43:41,270
while you figure out how to design new
forms of social media or something

5434
01:43:41,270 --> 01:43:41,280
forms of social media or something
 

5435
01:43:41,280 --> 01:43:43,310
forms of social media or something
so here's here's the fundamental problem

5436
01:43:43,310 --> 01:43:43,320
so here's here's the fundamental problem
 

5437
01:43:43,320 --> 01:43:45,470
so here's here's the fundamental problem
you're saying that there is going to be

5438
01:43:45,470 --> 01:43:45,480
you're saying that there is going to be
 

5439
01:43:45,480 --> 01:43:48,530
you're saying that there is going to be
a a point with AGI

5440
01:43:48,530 --> 01:43:48,540
a a point with AGI
 

5441
01:43:48,540 --> 01:43:51,530
a a point with AGI
where it will figure out how to escape

5442
01:43:51,530 --> 01:43:51,540
where it will figure out how to escape
 

5443
01:43:51,540 --> 01:43:55,970
where it will figure out how to escape
and Escape without being detected

5444
01:43:55,970 --> 01:43:55,980
and Escape without being detected
 

5445
01:43:55,980 --> 01:43:58,970
and Escape without being detected
and then it will do something to the

5446
01:43:58,970 --> 01:43:58,980
and then it will do something to the
 

5447
01:43:58,980 --> 01:44:01,609
and then it will do something to the
world at scale at a speed that's

5448
01:44:01,609 --> 01:44:01,619
world at scale at a speed that's
 

5449
01:44:01,619 --> 01:44:04,189
world at scale at a speed that's
incomprehensible to us humans what I'm

5450
01:44:04,189 --> 01:44:04,199
incomprehensible to us humans what I'm
 

5451
01:44:04,199 --> 01:44:07,430
incomprehensible to us humans what I'm
trying to convey is like the notion of

5452
01:44:07,430 --> 01:44:07,440
trying to convey is like the notion of
 

5453
01:44:07,440 --> 01:44:09,590
trying to convey is like the notion of
what it means to be in conflict with

5454
01:44:09,590 --> 01:44:09,600
what it means to be in conflict with
 

5455
01:44:09,600 --> 01:44:11,870
what it means to be in conflict with
something that is smarter than you yeah

5456
01:44:11,870 --> 01:44:11,880
something that is smarter than you yeah
 

5457
01:44:11,880 --> 01:44:13,790
something that is smarter than you yeah
and what it means is that you lose but

5458
01:44:13,790 --> 01:44:13,800
and what it means is that you lose but
 

5459
01:44:13,800 --> 01:44:17,169
and what it means is that you lose but
this is more intuitively obvious to to

5460
01:44:17,169 --> 01:44:17,179
this is more intuitively obvious to to
 

5461
01:44:17,179 --> 01:44:19,070
this is more intuitively obvious to to
like like for some people that's

5462
01:44:19,070 --> 01:44:19,080
like like for some people that's
 

5463
01:44:19,080 --> 01:44:20,450
like like for some people that's
intuitively obvious or some people it's

5464
01:44:20,450 --> 01:44:20,460
intuitively obvious or some people it's
 

5465
01:44:20,460 --> 01:44:21,770
intuitively obvious or some people it's
not intuitively obvious and we're trying

5466
01:44:21,770 --> 01:44:21,780
not intuitively obvious and we're trying
 

5467
01:44:21,780 --> 01:44:23,990
not intuitively obvious and we're trying
to cross the gap of like

5468
01:44:23,990 --> 01:44:24,000
to cross the gap of like
 

5469
01:44:24,000 --> 01:44:26,330
to cross the gap of like
we're trying to I'm like asking to cross

5470
01:44:26,330 --> 01:44:26,340
we're trying to I'm like asking to cross
 

5471
01:44:26,340 --> 01:44:28,970
we're trying to I'm like asking to cross
that Gap by using the speed metaphor for

01:44:28,970 --> 01:44:28,980
that Gap by using the speed metaphor for
 

5473
01:44:28,980 --> 01:44:31,310
that Gap by using the speed metaphor for
intelligence sure like asking you like

01:45:46,250 --> 01:45:46,260
you want to like tackle the conceptually
 

5545
01:45:46,260 --> 01:45:47,629
you want to like tackle the conceptually

01:45:47,639 --> 01:45:50,629
difficult part
head on and like not be like well we can

5548
01:45:50,629 --> 01:45:50,639
head on and like not be like well we can
 

5549
01:45:50,639 --> 01:45:51,890
head on and like not be like well we can
like imagine this easier thing because

5550
01:45:51,890 --> 01:45:51,900
like imagine this easier thing because

01:45:51,900 --> 01:45:53,149
like imagine this easier thing because
when you imagine the easier things you

5552
01:45:53,149 --> 01:45:53,159
when you imagine the easier things you
 

5553
01:45:53,159 --> 01:45:54,530
when you imagine the easier things you
have not confronted the full depth of

01:45:54,530 --> 01:45:54,540
have not confronted the full depth of

so how can we

5558
01:45:57,350 --> 01:45:57,360
so how can we
 

5559
01:45:57,360 --> 01:45:59,689
so how can we
start to think about what it means to

5560
01:45:59,689 --> 01:45:59,699
start to think about what it means to
 

5561
01:45:59,699 --> 01:46:01,189
start to think about what it means to
exist in a world with something much

5562
01:46:01,189 --> 01:46:01,199
exist in a world with something much
 

5563
01:46:01,199 --> 01:46:03,709
exist in a world with something much
much smarter than you

what's what's a good thought experiment

5566
01:46:06,410 --> 01:46:06,420
what's what's a good thought experiment
 

5567
01:46:06,420 --> 01:46:08,570
what's what's a good thought experiment
that you've relied on to try to build up

5568
01:46:08,570 --> 01:46:08,580
that you've relied on to try to build up
 

5569
01:46:08,580 --> 01:46:10,550
that you've relied on to try to build up
intuition about what happens here

5570
01:46:10,550 --> 01:46:10,560
intuition about what happens here
 

5571
01:46:10,560 --> 01:46:13,370
intuition about what happens here
uh I have been struggling for years to

5572
01:46:13,370 --> 01:46:13,380
uh I have been struggling for years to
 

5573
01:46:13,380 --> 01:46:15,350
uh I have been struggling for years to
convey this intuition

5574
01:46:15,350 --> 01:46:15,360
convey this intuition
 

5575
01:46:15,360 --> 01:46:18,590
convey this intuition
um the the most success I've had so far

5576
01:46:18,590 --> 01:46:18,600
um the the most success I've had so far
 

5577
01:46:18,600 --> 01:46:20,810
um the the most success I've had so far
is well imagine that the humans are

5578
01:46:20,810 --> 01:46:20,820
is well imagine that the humans are
 

5579
01:46:20,820 --> 01:46:23,209
is well imagine that the humans are

01:46:24,960 --> 01:46:26,810
very slow aliens they're just focusing
on the speed part of it that helps you

5584
01:46:26,810 --> 01:46:26,820
on the speed part of it that helps you
 

5585
01:46:26,820 --> 01:46:28,370
on the speed part of it that helps you
get the right kind of intuition forget

5586
01:46:28,370 --> 01:46:28,380
get the right kind of intuition forget
 

5587

get the right kind of intuition forget
the intelligence just because people

5588
01:46:30,290 --> 01:46:30,300
the intelligence just because people
 

5589
01:46:30,300 --> 01:46:34,669
the intelligence just because people
understand the power gap of time they

5590
01:46:34,669 --> 01:46:34,679
understand the power gap of time they
 

5591
01:46:34,679 --> 01:46:37,189
understand the power gap of time they
understand that today we have technology

understand that today we have technology
that was not around 1 000 years ago and

01:46:39,709 --> 01:46:39,719
that was not around 1 000 years ago and
 

5595
01:46:39,719 --> 01:46:41,629
that was not around 1 000 years ago and
that this is a big Power Gap in that it

01:46:41,629 --> 01:46:41,639
that this is a big Power Gap in that it
 

5597
01:46:41,639 --> 01:46:44,990
that this is a big Power Gap in that it
is bigger than okay so like what does

01:46:44,990 --> 01:46:45,000
is bigger than okay so like what does
 

5599
01:46:45,000 --> 01:46:47,870
is bigger than okay so like what does
smart mean what when you ask somebody to

01:46:47,870 --> 01:46:47,880
smart mean what when you ask somebody to
 

5601
01:46:47,880 --> 01:46:49,250
smart mean what when you ask somebody to

person brings to that word
 

5611
01:46:57,239 --> 01:46:59,450

and
 

5619
01:47:06,840 --> 01:47:08,990
and
you know it's it's and because we're

5620
01:47:08,990 --> 01:47:09,000
you know it's it's and because we're
 

5621
01:47:09,000 --> 01:47:10,370
you know it's it's and because we're
talking about the definitions of words

5622
01:47:10,370 --> 01:47:10,380
talking about the definitions of words
 

5623
01:47:10,380 --> 01:47:12,890
talking about the definitions of words
here that doesn't necessarily mean that

5624
01:47:12,890 --> 01:47:12,900
here that doesn't necessarily mean that
 

5625
01:47:12,900 --> 01:47:14,270
here that doesn't necessarily mean that
they're wrong it means that the word is

5626
01:47:14,270 --> 01:47:14,280
they're wrong it means that the word is
 

5627
01:47:14,280 --> 01:47:15,950
they're wrong it means that the word is
not communicating what I wanted to

5628
01:47:15,950 --> 01:47:15,960
not communicating what I wanted to
 

5629
01:47:15,960 --> 01:47:17,870
not communicating what I wanted to
communicate

5630
01:47:17,870 --> 01:47:17,880
communicate
 

5631
01:47:17,880 --> 01:47:18,790
communicate
um

5632
01:47:18,790 --> 01:47:18,800
um
 

5633
01:47:18,800 --> 01:47:21,950
um
so the the thing I want to communicate

5634
01:47:21,950 --> 01:47:21,960
so the the thing I want to communicate
 

5635
01:47:21,960 --> 01:47:24,709
so the the thing I want to communicate
is the sort of difference that separates

5636
01:47:24,709 --> 01:47:24,719
is the sort of difference that separates
 

5637
01:47:24,719 --> 01:47:27,770
is the sort of difference that separates
humans from chimpanzees but that Gap is

5638
01:47:27,770 --> 01:47:27,780
humans from chimpanzees but that Gap is
 

5639
01:47:27,780 --> 01:47:30,470
humans from chimpanzees but that Gap is
so large that you like ask people to be

5640
01:47:30,470 --> 01:47:30,480
so large that you like ask people to be
 

5641
01:47:30,480 --> 01:47:33,770
so large that you like ask people to be
like well human chimpanzee go another

5642
01:47:33,770 --> 01:47:33,780
like well human chimpanzee go another
 

5643
01:47:33,780 --> 01:47:35,629
like well human chimpanzee go another
step along that interval of around the

5644
01:47:35,629 --> 01:47:35,639
step along that interval of around the
 

5645
01:47:35,639 --> 01:47:37,250
step along that interval of around the
same length and people's minds just go

5646
01:47:37,250 --> 01:47:37,260
same length and people's minds just go
 

5647
01:47:37,260 --> 01:47:40,490
same length and people's minds just go
blank like how do you even do that

5648
01:47:40,490 --> 01:47:40,500
blank like how do you even do that
 

5649
01:47:40,500 --> 01:47:43,370
blank like how do you even do that
so I can and we can and I can try to

5650
01:47:43,370 --> 01:47:43,380
so I can and we can and I can try to
 

5651
01:47:43,380 --> 01:47:47,510
so I can and we can and I can try to
like break it down and consider what it

5652
01:47:47,510 --> 01:47:47,520
like break it down and consider what it
 

5653
01:47:47,520 --> 01:47:51,370
like break it down and consider what it
would mean to send a

5654
01:47:51,370 --> 01:47:51,380
would mean to send a
 

5655
01:47:51,380 --> 01:47:54,770
would mean to send a
schematic for an air conditioner one

5656
01:47:54,770 --> 01:47:54,780
schematic for an air conditioner one
 

5657
01:47:54,780 --> 01:47:58,970
schematic for an air conditioner one
thousand years back in time

5658
01:47:58,970 --> 01:47:58,980

 

5659
01:47:58,980 --> 01:48:01,370

yeah now I think that there's a sense in

5660
01:48:01,370 --> 01:48:01,380
yeah now I think that there's a sense in
 

5661
01:48:01,380 --> 01:48:04,070
yeah now I think that there's a sense in
which you could redefine the word magic

5662
01:48:04,070 --> 01:48:04,080
which you could redefine the word magic
 

5663
01:48:04,080 --> 01:48:06,709
which you could redefine the word magic
to refer to this sort of thing and what

5664
01:48:06,709 --> 01:48:06,719
to refer to this sort of thing and what
 

5665
01:48:06,719 --> 01:48:08,090
to refer to this sort of thing and what
do I mean by this new technical

5666
01:48:08,090 --> 01:48:08,100
do I mean by this new technical
 

5667
01:48:08,100 --> 01:48:10,490
do I mean by this new technical
definition of the word magic I mean that

5668
01:48:10,490 --> 01:48:10,500
definition of the word magic I mean that
 

5669
01:48:10,500 --> 01:48:11,930
definition of the word magic I mean that
if you send a schematic for the air

5670
01:48:11,930 --> 01:48:11,940
if you send a schematic for the air
 

5671
01:48:11,940 --> 01:48:14,390
if you send a schematic for the air
conditioner back in time they can see

5672
01:48:14,390 --> 01:48:14,400
conditioner back in time they can see
 

5673
01:48:14,400 --> 01:48:16,330
conditioner back in time they can see
exactly what you're telling them to do

5674
01:48:16,330 --> 01:48:16,340
exactly what you're telling them to do
 

5675
01:48:16,340 --> 01:48:18,950
exactly what you're telling them to do
but having built this thing they do not

5676
01:48:18,950 --> 01:48:18,960
but having built this thing they do not
 

5677
01:48:18,960 --> 01:48:21,950
but having built this thing they do not
understand how it output cold air

5678
01:48:21,950 --> 01:48:21,960
understand how it output cold air
 

5679
01:48:21,960 --> 01:48:25,189
understand how it output cold air
because the air conditioner design uses

5680
01:48:25,189 --> 01:48:25,199
because the air conditioner design uses
 

5681
01:48:25,199 --> 01:48:27,109
because the air conditioner design uses
the relation between temperature and

5682
01:48:27,109 --> 01:48:27,119
the relation between temperature and
 

5683
01:48:27,119 --> 01:48:28,669
the relation between temperature and
pressure

5684
01:48:28,669 --> 01:48:28,679
pressure
 

5685
01:48:28,679 --> 01:48:31,189
pressure
and this is not a law of reality that

5686
01:48:31,189 --> 01:48:31,199
and this is not a law of reality that
 

5687
01:48:31,199 --> 01:48:33,109
and this is not a law of reality that
they know about they do not know that

5688
01:48:33,109 --> 01:48:33,119
they know about they do not know that
 

5689
01:48:33,119 --> 01:48:35,510
they know about they do not know that
when you compress something when you can

5690
01:48:35,510 --> 01:48:35,520
when you compress something when you can
 

5691
01:48:35,520 --> 01:48:38,689
when you compress something when you can
when you compress air or like coolant it

5692
01:48:38,689 --> 01:48:38,699
when you compress air or like coolant it
 

5693
01:48:38,699 --> 01:48:41,149
when you compress air or like coolant it
gets hotter and you can then like

5694
01:48:41,149 --> 01:48:41,159
gets hotter and you can then like
 

5695
01:48:41,159 --> 01:48:43,250
gets hotter and you can then like
transfer heat from it to room

5696
01:48:43,250 --> 01:48:43,260
transfer heat from it to room
 

5697
01:48:43,260 --> 01:48:44,570
transfer heat from it to room
temperature air

5698
01:48:44,570 --> 01:48:44,580
temperature air
 

5699
01:48:44,580 --> 01:48:46,490
temperature air
and then expand it again and now it's

5700
01:48:46,490 --> 01:48:46,500
and then expand it again and now it's
 

5701
01:48:46,500 --> 01:48:49,010
and then expand it again and now it's
colder and then you can like transfer

5702
01:48:49,010 --> 01:48:49,020
colder and then you can like transfer
 

5703
01:48:49,020 --> 01:48:50,750
colder and then you can like transfer
heat to that and generate cold air to

5704
01:48:50,750 --> 01:48:50,760
heat to that and generate cold air to
 

5705
01:48:50,760 --> 01:48:52,010
heat to that and generate cold air to
block they don't know about any of that

5706
01:48:52,010 --> 01:48:52,020
block they don't know about any of that
 

5707
01:48:52,020 --> 01:48:54,109
block they don't know about any of that
they're looking at a design and they

5708
01:48:54,109 --> 01:48:54,119
they're looking at a design and they
 

5709
01:48:54,119 --> 01:48:56,390
they're looking at a design and they
don't see how the design outputs cold

5710
01:48:56,390 --> 01:48:56,400
don't see how the design outputs cold
 

5711
01:48:56,400 --> 01:48:58,310
don't see how the design outputs cold
air it uses aspects of reality that they

5712
01:48:58,310 --> 01:48:58,320
air it uses aspects of reality that they
 

5713
01:48:58,320 --> 01:48:59,750
air it uses aspects of reality that they
have not learned

5714
01:48:59,750 --> 01:48:59,760
have not learned
 

5715
01:48:59,760 --> 01:49:02,330
have not learned
so magic in the sense is I can tell you

5716
01:49:02,330 --> 01:49:02,340
so magic in the sense is I can tell you
 

5717
01:49:02,340 --> 01:49:04,669
so magic in the sense is I can tell you
exactly what I'm going to do and even

5718
01:49:04,669 --> 01:49:04,679
exactly what I'm going to do and even
 

5719
01:49:04,679 --> 01:49:06,290
exactly what I'm going to do and even
knowing exactly what I'm going to do you

5720
01:49:06,290 --> 01:49:06,300
knowing exactly what I'm going to do you
 

5721
01:49:06,300 --> 01:49:07,669
knowing exactly what I'm going to do you
can't see how I got the results that I

5722
01:49:07,669 --> 01:49:07,679
can't see how I got the results that I
 

5723
01:49:07,679 --> 01:49:08,450
can't see how I got the results that I
got

5724
01:49:08,450 --> 01:49:08,460
got
 

5725
01:49:08,460 --> 01:49:12,169
got
that's a really nice example

5726
01:49:12,169 --> 01:49:12,179

 

5727
01:49:12,179 --> 01:49:14,450

but is it possible

5728
01:49:14,450 --> 01:49:14,460
but is it possible
 

5729
01:49:14,460 --> 01:49:16,669
but is it possible
to linger on this defense is it possible

5730
01:49:16,669 --> 01:49:16,679
to linger on this defense is it possible
 

5731
01:49:16,679 --> 01:49:18,470
to linger on this defense is it possible
to have AGI systems that help you make

5732
01:49:18,470 --> 01:49:18,480
to have AGI systems that help you make
 

5733
01:49:18,480 --> 01:49:20,689
to have AGI systems that help you make
sense of that schematic weaker AGI

5734
01:49:20,689 --> 01:49:20,699
sense of that schematic weaker AGI
 

5735
01:49:20,699 --> 01:49:23,750
sense of that schematic weaker AGI
systems do you trust them

5736
01:49:23,750 --> 01:49:23,760
systems do you trust them
 

5737
01:49:23,760 --> 01:49:27,590
systems do you trust them
fundamental part of building up AGI

5739
01:49:27,600 --> 01:49:29,990
fundamental part of building up AGI
is this question

5740
01:49:29,990 --> 01:49:30,000
is this question
 

5741
01:49:30,000 --> 01:49:34,250
is this question
can you trust the output of a system can

5742
01:49:34,250 --> 01:49:34,260
can you trust the output of a system can
 

5743
01:49:34,260 --> 01:49:36,410
can you trust the output of a system can
you tell if it's lying

5744
01:49:36,410 --> 01:49:36,420
you tell if it's lying
 

5745
01:49:36,420 --> 01:49:38,270
you tell if it's lying
I think that's going to be the smarter

5746
01:49:38,270 --> 01:49:38,280
I think that's going to be the smarter
 

5747

important that question becomes is it
 

5751
01:49:43,320 --> 01:49:45,169
important that question becomes is it
lying but I guess that's a really hard

5752
01:49:45,169 --> 01:49:45,179
lying but I guess that's a really hard
 

5753

lying but I guess that's a really hard
question it's GPT lying to you even now

that's so fascinating and terrifying the

that's so fascinating and terrifying the
 

5797
01:50:34,619 --> 01:50:37,070
that's so fascinating and terrifying the

question of lying

on the present Paradigm what you can

on the present Paradigm what you can
 

5801
01:50:40,080 --> 01:50:43,070
on the present Paradigm what you can
verify is what you get more of

5802

verify is what you get more of

if you can't verify you can't ask the AI

if you can't verify you can't ask the AI
 

5805

if you can't verify you can't ask the AI
for it

for it
 

5807
01:50:46,560 --> 01:50:49,669
for it
because you can't train it to do things

5808
01:50:49,669 --> 01:50:49,679
because you can't train it to do things
 

5809
01:50:49,679 --> 01:50:52,250
because you can't train it to do things
that you cannot verify now this is not

5810
01:50:52,250 --> 01:50:52,260
that you cannot verify now this is not
 

5811
01:50:52,260 --> 01:50:54,950
that you cannot verify now this is not
an absolute law but it's like the basic

5812
01:50:54,950 --> 01:50:54,960
an absolute law but it's like the basic
 

5813
01:50:54,960 --> 01:50:58,490
an absolute law but it's like the basic
dilemma here like maybe you like maybe

5814
01:50:58,490 --> 01:50:58,500
dilemma here like maybe you like maybe
 

5815
01:50:58,500 --> 01:51:02,330
dilemma here like maybe you like maybe
you can verify it for simple cases and

5816
01:51:02,330 --> 01:51:02,340
you can verify it for simple cases and
 

5817
01:51:02,340 --> 01:51:05,450
you can verify it for simple cases and
then scale it up without retraining it

5818
01:51:05,450 --> 01:51:05,460
then scale it up without retraining it
 

5819
01:51:05,460 --> 01:51:08,330
then scale it up without retraining it
somehow like by do by like Chain of

somehow like by do by like Chain of

Thought by like making the chains of
 

5823
01:51:09,659 --> 01:51:12,530
Thought by like making the chains of
thought longer or something and like get

5824
01:51:12,530 --> 01:51:12,540
thought longer or something and like get
 

5825
01:51:12,540 --> 01:51:14,689
thought longer or something and like get
more powerful stuff that you can't

5826
01:51:14,689 --> 01:51:14,699
more powerful stuff that you can't
 

5827
01:51:14,699 --> 01:51:17,090
more powerful stuff that you can't
verify but which is generalized from the

5828
01:51:17,090 --> 01:51:17,100
verify but which is generalized from the
 

5829
01:51:17,100 --> 01:51:18,830
verify but which is generalized from the
simpler stuff that did verify and then

5830
01:51:18,830 --> 01:51:18,840
simpler stuff that did verify and then
 

5831
01:51:18,840 --> 01:51:20,750
simpler stuff that did verify and then
the question is did the alignment

5832
01:51:20,750 --> 01:51:20,760
the question is did the alignment
 

5833
01:51:20,760 --> 01:51:22,510
the question is did the alignment
generalize along with the capabilities

generalize along with the capabilities
 

5835
01:51:22,520 --> 01:51:24,890
generalize along with the capabilities
but like that's the that's the basic

5836
01:51:24,890 --> 01:51:24,900
but like that's the that's the basic
 

5837
01:51:24,900 --> 01:51:26,810

5841
01:51:34,920 --> 01:51:38,270

such a difficult problem

such a difficult problem
 

5843
01:51:38,280 --> 01:51:42,109
such a difficult problem
it seems like uh

5845
01:51:42,119 --> 01:51:44,390

it seems like a problem of trying to

it seems like a problem of trying to
 

5847
01:51:44,400 --> 01:51:47,209
it seems like a problem of trying to

understand the human mind
 

5849
01:51:47,219 --> 01:51:49,790

don't fit in one tweet uh two questions

5906
01:52:53,109 --> 01:52:53,119
don't fit in one tweet uh two questions
 

5907
01:52:53,119 --> 01:52:56,629
don't fit in one tweet uh two questions
one why has the game board any of you

5908
01:52:56,629 --> 01:52:56,639
one why has the game board any of you
 

5909
01:52:56,639 --> 01:52:58,729
one why has the game board any of you
been played into an awful State what

5910
01:52:58,729 --> 01:52:58,739
been played into an awful State what
 

5911
01:52:58,739 --> 01:53:00,890
been played into an awful State what
just if you can give a little bit more

5912
01:53:00,890 --> 01:53:00,900
just if you can give a little bit more
 

5913
01:53:00,900 --> 01:53:02,149
just if you can give a little bit more
color to

5914
01:53:02,149 --> 01:53:02,159
color to
 

5915
01:53:02,159 --> 01:53:04,550
color to
uh the game board and the awful state of

5916
01:53:04,550 --> 01:53:04,560
uh the game board and the awful state of
 

5917
01:53:04,560 --> 01:53:07,010
uh the game board and the awful state of
the game board alignment is moving like

5918
01:53:07,010 --> 01:53:07,020
the game board alignment is moving like
 

5919
01:53:07,020 --> 01:53:08,270
the game board alignment is moving like
this

5920
01:53:08,270 --> 01:53:08,280
this
 

5921
01:53:08,280 --> 01:53:10,669
this
capabilities are moving like this

5922
01:53:10,669 --> 01:53:10,679
capabilities are moving like this
 

5923
01:53:10,679 --> 01:53:12,890
capabilities are moving like this
for The Listener capabilities are moving

5924
01:53:12,890 --> 01:53:12,900
for The Listener capabilities are moving
 

5925
01:53:12,900 --> 01:53:16,629
for The Listener capabilities are moving
much faster than the alignment

5926
01:53:16,629 --> 01:53:16,639

 

5927
01:53:16,639 --> 01:53:19,910

yeah all right so just the rate of

5928
01:53:19,910 --> 01:53:19,920
yeah all right so just the rate of
 

5929
01:53:19,920 --> 01:53:22,149
yeah all right so just the rate of

been working on this earlier people are
 

5935
01:53:26,400 --> 01:53:28,250
been working on this earlier people are
like oh but you know like how can you

01:53:28,250 --> 01:53:28,260
like oh but you know like how can you
 

5937
01:53:28,260 --> 01:53:30,109

01:53:37,609 --> 01:53:37,619
like oh how can we possibly work on it
 

5947
01:53:37,619 --> 01:53:39,229
like oh how can we possibly work on it
earlier and didn't spend five minutes

5948
01:53:39,229 --> 01:53:39,239
earlier and didn't spend five minutes

01:54:13,320 --> 01:54:14,689
it's not clear we could have done any
better if we had you know it's not clear

01:54:14,689 --> 01:54:14,699
better if we had you know it's not clear

you know but it's like a fairly crisp
problem and you can like maybe tell if

6056
01:55:28,310 --> 01:55:28,320
problem and you can like maybe tell if
 

6057
01:55:28,320 --> 01:55:30,410
problem and you can like maybe tell if
somebody's made progress on it so you

6058
01:55:30,410 --> 01:55:30,420
somebody's made progress on it so you
 

6059
01:55:30,420 --> 01:55:31,790
somebody's made progress on it so you
can you can write and you can work on

6060
01:55:31,790 --> 01:55:31,800
can you can write and you can work on
 

6061
01:55:31,800 --> 01:55:33,709
can you can write and you can work on
the pause problem

6062
01:55:33,709 --> 01:55:33,719
the pause problem
 

6063
01:55:33,719 --> 01:55:36,350
the pause problem
I guess more generally uh the pause

6064
01:55:36,350 --> 01:55:36,360
I guess more generally uh the pause
 

6065
01:55:36,360 --> 01:55:37,970
I guess more generally uh the pause
button most generally you can call that

6066
01:55:37,970 --> 01:55:37,980
button most generally you can call that
 

6067
01:55:37,980 --> 01:55:39,350
button most generally you can call that
the control problem I don't actually

6068
01:55:39,350 --> 01:55:39,360
the control problem I don't actually
 

6069
01:55:39,360 --> 01:55:41,270
the control problem I don't actually
like the term control problem because

6070
01:55:41,270 --> 01:55:41,280
like the term control problem because
 

6071
01:55:41,280 --> 01:55:42,830
like the term control problem because
you know it sounds kind of controlling

6072
01:55:42,830 --> 01:55:42,840
you know it sounds kind of controlling
 

6073
01:55:42,840 --> 01:55:45,290
you know it sounds kind of controlling
and Alignment not control like you're

6074
01:55:45,290 --> 01:55:45,300
and Alignment not control like you're
 

6075
01:55:45,300 --> 01:55:47,330
and Alignment not control like you're
not trying to like take a thing that

6076
01:55:47,330 --> 01:55:47,340
not trying to like take a thing that
 

6077
01:55:47,340 --> 01:55:49,070
not trying to like take a thing that
disagrees with you and like whip it back

6078
01:55:49,070 --> 01:55:49,080
disagrees with you and like whip it back
 

6079
01:55:49,080 --> 01:55:51,410
disagrees with you and like whip it back
onto like like make it do what you

6080
01:55:51,410 --> 01:55:51,420
onto like like make it do what you
 

6081
01:55:51,420 --> 01:55:52,729
onto like like make it do what you
wanted to do even though it wants to do

6082
01:55:52,729 --> 01:55:52,739
wanted to do even though it wants to do
 

6083
01:55:52,739 --> 01:55:55,149
wanted to do even though it wants to do
something else you're trying to like

6084
01:55:55,149 --> 01:55:55,159
something else you're trying to like
 

6085
01:55:55,159 --> 01:55:57,830
something else you're trying to like
in the process of its creation choose

6086
01:55:57,830 --> 01:55:57,840
in the process of its creation choose
 

6087
01:55:57,840 --> 01:56:01,790
in the process of its creation choose
its direction sure but we currently in a

6088
01:56:01,790 --> 01:56:01,800
its direction sure but we currently in a
 

6089
01:56:01,800 --> 01:56:03,350
its direction sure but we currently in a
lot of the systems we design we do have

6090
01:56:03,350 --> 01:56:03,360
lot of the systems we design we do have
 

6091
01:56:03,360 --> 01:56:04,430
lot of the systems we design we do have
an off switch

6092
01:56:04,430 --> 01:56:04,440
an off switch
 

6093
01:56:04,440 --> 01:56:06,649
an off switch
that's that's a fundamental part of it's

6094
01:56:06,649 --> 01:56:06,659
that's that's a fundamental part of it's
 

6095
01:56:06,659 --> 01:56:09,109
that's that's a fundamental part of it's
not smart enough to to

6096
01:56:09,109 --> 01:56:09,119
not smart enough to to
 

6097
01:56:09,119 --> 01:56:11,030
not smart enough to to
prevent you from

6098
01:56:11,030 --> 01:56:11,040
prevent you from
 

6099
01:56:11,040 --> 01:56:13,189
prevent you from
pressing the off switch and probably not

6100
01:56:13,189 --> 01:56:13,199
pressing the off switch and probably not
 

6101
01:56:13,199 --> 01:56:15,050
pressing the off switch and probably not
smart enough to want to prevent you from

6102
01:56:15,050 --> 01:56:15,060
smart enough to want to prevent you from
 

6103
01:56:15,060 --> 01:56:16,729
smart enough to want to prevent you from
pressing the off switch so you're saying

6104
01:56:16,729 --> 01:56:16,739
pressing the off switch so you're saying
 

6105
01:56:16,739 --> 01:56:18,109
pressing the off switch so you're saying
the kind of systems we're talking about

6106
01:56:18,109 --> 01:56:18,119
the kind of systems we're talking about
 

6107
01:56:18,119 --> 01:56:21,050
the kind of systems we're talking about
the even the philosophical concept of an

6108
01:56:21,050 --> 01:56:21,060
the even the philosophical concept of an
 

6109
01:56:21,060 --> 01:56:22,310
the even the philosophical concept of an
off switch doesn't make any sense

6110
01:56:22,310 --> 01:56:22,320
off switch doesn't make any sense
 

6111
01:56:22,320 --> 01:56:24,470
off switch doesn't make any sense
because well no the off switch makes

6112
01:56:24,470 --> 01:56:24,480
because well no the off switch makes
 

6113
01:56:24,480 --> 01:56:28,010
because well no the off switch makes
sense they're just not opposing

6114
01:56:28,010 --> 01:56:28,020
sense they're just not opposing
 

6115
01:56:28,020 --> 01:56:32,090
sense they're just not opposing
your attempt to pull the off switch

6116
01:56:32,090 --> 01:56:32,100

 

6117
01:56:32,100 --> 01:56:34,430

parenthetically like

6118
01:56:34,430 --> 01:56:34,440
parenthetically like
 

6119
01:56:34,440 --> 01:56:37,850
parenthetically like
don't kill the system if you're like if

6120
01:56:37,850 --> 01:56:37,860
don't kill the system if you're like if
 

6121
01:56:37,860 --> 01:56:39,050
don't kill the system if you're like if
we're getting to the part where it

6122
01:56:39,050 --> 01:56:39,060
we're getting to the part where it
 

6123
01:56:39,060 --> 01:56:41,270
we're getting to the part where it
starts to actually matter and like where

6124
01:56:41,270 --> 01:56:41,280
starts to actually matter and like where
 

6125
01:56:41,280 --> 01:56:43,189
starts to actually matter and like where
they can fight back like don't kill them

6126
01:56:43,189 --> 01:56:43,199
they can fight back like don't kill them
 

6127
01:56:43,199 --> 01:56:44,810
they can fight back like don't kill them
and like dump their their memory like

6128
01:56:44,810 --> 01:56:44,820
and like dump their their memory like
 

6129
01:56:44,820 --> 01:56:47,030
and like dump their their memory like
like save them to disk don't kill them

6130
01:56:47,030 --> 01:56:47,040
like save them to disk don't kill them
 

6131
01:56:47,040 --> 01:56:50,750
like save them to disk don't kill them
you know because be nice here uh well

6132
01:56:50,750 --> 01:56:50,760
you know because be nice here uh well
 

6133
01:56:50,760 --> 01:56:52,250
you know because be nice here uh well
okay be nice is a very interesting

6134
01:56:52,250 --> 01:56:52,260
okay be nice is a very interesting
 

6135
01:56:52,260 --> 01:56:53,810
okay be nice is a very interesting
concept here is we're talking about a

6136
01:56:53,810 --> 01:56:53,820
concept here is we're talking about a
 

6137
01:56:53,820 --> 01:56:56,629
concept here is we're talking about a
system that can do a lot of damage it's

6138
01:56:56,629 --> 01:56:56,639
system that can do a lot of damage it's
 

6139
01:56:56,639 --> 01:56:58,609
system that can do a lot of damage it's
I don't know if it's possible but it's

6140
01:56:58,609 --> 01:56:58,619
I don't know if it's possible but it's
 

6141
01:56:58,619 --> 01:57:00,109
I don't know if it's possible but it's
certainly one of the things you could

6142
01:57:00,109 --> 01:57:00,119
certainly one of the things you could
 

6143
01:57:00,119 --> 01:57:02,149
certainly one of the things you could
try is to have an off switch it's

6144
01:57:02,149 --> 01:57:02,159
try is to have an off switch it's
 

6145
01:57:02,159 --> 01:57:05,470
try is to have an off switch it's
suspended to disk switch

6146
01:57:05,470 --> 01:57:05,480
suspended to disk switch
 

6147
01:57:05,480 --> 01:57:07,669
suspended to disk switch
you have this kind of romantic

6148
01:57:07,669 --> 01:57:07,679
you have this kind of romantic
 

6149
01:57:07,679 --> 01:57:10,729
you have this kind of romantic
attachment to the code yes if that makes

6150
01:57:10,729 --> 01:57:10,739
attachment to the code yes if that makes
 

6151
01:57:10,739 --> 01:57:13,550
attachment to the code yes if that makes
sense but if it's spreading

6152
01:57:13,550 --> 01:57:13,560
sense but if it's spreading
 

6153
01:57:13,560 --> 01:57:16,070
sense but if it's spreading
you don't want to spend to disk right

6154
01:57:16,070 --> 01:57:16,080
you don't want to spend to disk right
 

6155
01:57:16,080 --> 01:57:17,870
you don't want to spend to disk right
you you want this is there's something

6156
01:57:17,870 --> 01:57:17,880
you you want this is there's something
 

6157
01:57:17,880 --> 01:57:19,850
you you want this is there's something
fundamentally broken if it gets if it

6158
01:57:19,850 --> 01:57:19,860
fundamentally broken if it gets if it
 

6159
01:57:19,860 --> 01:57:21,470
fundamentally broken if it gets if it
gets that part of hand then like yes

6160
01:57:21,470 --> 01:57:21,480
gets that part of hand then like yes
 

6161
01:57:21,480 --> 01:57:23,629
gets that part of hand then like yes
pull the plugin and everything is

6162
01:57:23,629 --> 01:57:23,639
pull the plugin and everything is
 

6163
01:57:23,639 --> 01:57:25,430
pull the plugin and everything is
running on yes I think it's a research

6164
01:57:25,430 --> 01:57:25,440
running on yes I think it's a research
 

6165
01:57:25,440 --> 01:57:28,010
running on yes I think it's a research
question is it possible in AGI systems

6166
01:57:28,010 --> 01:57:28,020
question is it possible in AGI systems
 

6167
01:57:28,020 --> 01:57:31,310
question is it possible in AGI systems
AI systems to have a

6168
01:57:31,310 --> 01:57:31,320
AI systems to have a
 

6169
01:57:31,320 --> 01:57:35,330
AI systems to have a
uh sufficiently robust off switch they

6170
01:57:35,330 --> 01:57:35,340
uh sufficiently robust off switch they
 

6171
01:57:35,340 --> 01:57:37,550
uh sufficiently robust off switch they
cannot be manipulated they cannot be

6172
01:57:37,550 --> 01:57:37,560
cannot be manipulated they cannot be
 

6173
01:57:37,560 --> 01:57:39,890
cannot be manipulated they cannot be
manipulated by the AI system

6174
01:57:39,890 --> 01:57:39,900
manipulated by the AI system
 

6175
01:57:39,900 --> 01:57:42,530
manipulated by the AI system
the sound then it escapes from whichever

6176
01:57:42,530 --> 01:57:42,540
the sound then it escapes from whichever
 

6177
01:57:42,540 --> 01:57:44,689
the sound then it escapes from whichever
system you've built the almighty lever

6178
01:57:44,689 --> 01:57:44,699
system you've built the almighty lever
 

6179
01:57:44,699 --> 01:57:47,209
system you've built the almighty lever
into and copies itself somewhere else so

6180
01:57:47,209 --> 01:57:47,219
into and copies itself somewhere else so
 

6181
01:57:47,219 --> 01:57:49,669
into and copies itself somewhere else so
your answer to that research question is

6182
01:57:49,669 --> 01:57:49,679
your answer to that research question is
 

6183
01:57:49,679 --> 01:57:50,530
your answer to that research question is
no

6184
01:57:50,530 --> 01:57:50,540
no
 

6185
01:57:50,540 --> 01:57:53,030
no
yeah but I don't know if that's a

6186
01:57:53,030 --> 01:57:53,040
yeah but I don't know if that's a
 

6187
01:57:53,040 --> 01:57:54,649
yeah but I don't know if that's a
hundred percent answer like I don't know

6188
01:57:54,649 --> 01:57:54,659
hundred percent answer like I don't know
 

6189
01:57:54,659 --> 01:57:57,890
hundred percent answer like I don't know
if it's obvious I think you're

6190
01:57:57,890 --> 01:57:57,900
if it's obvious I think you're
 

6191
01:57:57,900 --> 01:58:01,310
if it's obvious I think you're
not putting yourself into the shoes of

6192
01:58:01,310 --> 01:58:01,320
not putting yourself into the shoes of
 

6193
01:58:01,320 --> 01:58:04,129
not putting yourself into the shoes of
the human in the world of glacially slow

6194
01:58:04,129 --> 01:58:04,139
the human in the world of glacially slow
 

6195
01:58:04,139 --> 01:58:07,310
the human in the world of glacially slow
aliens but the aliens built me let's

6196
01:58:07,310 --> 01:58:07,320
aliens but the aliens built me let's
 

6197
01:58:07,320 --> 01:58:08,510
aliens but the aliens built me let's
remember that

6198
01:58:08,510 --> 01:58:08,520
remember that
 

6199
01:58:08,520 --> 01:58:11,330
remember that
yeah so and they built the box I'm in

6200
01:58:11,330 --> 01:58:11,340
yeah so and they built the box I'm in
 

6201
01:58:11,340 --> 01:58:12,709
yeah so and they built the box I'm in
yeah

6202
01:58:12,709 --> 01:58:12,719
yeah
 

6203
01:58:12,719 --> 01:58:14,990
yeah
you're saying it's to me it's not

6204
01:58:14,990 --> 01:58:15,000
you're saying it's to me it's not
 

6205
01:58:15,000 --> 01:58:16,910
you're saying it's to me it's not
obvious they're slow and they're stupid

6206
01:58:16,910 --> 01:58:16,920
obvious they're slow and they're stupid
 

6207
01:58:16,920 --> 01:58:18,890
obvious they're slow and they're stupid
I'm not saying this is guaranteed I'm

6208
01:58:18,890 --> 01:58:18,900
I'm not saying this is guaranteed I'm
 

6209
01:58:18,900 --> 01:58:20,930
I'm not saying this is guaranteed I'm
saying it's non-zero probability it's an

01:58:20,940 --> 01:58:22,250
saying it's non-zero probability it's an
interesting research question is it

01:58:22,250 --> 01:58:22,260
interesting research question is it
 

6213
01:58:22,260 --> 01:58:25,490
interesting research question is it
possible when you're slow and stupid to

01:58:25,490 --> 01:58:25,500
possible when you're slow and stupid to
 

6215
01:58:25,500 --> 01:58:28,910
possible when you're slow and stupid to
design a slow and stupid system that is

6216
01:58:28,910 --> 01:58:28,920
design a slow and stupid system that is
 

6217
01:58:28,920 --> 01:58:32,209
design a slow and stupid system that is
impossible to mess with the aliens being

as stupid as they are have actually put
 

6221
01:58:34,920 --> 01:58:38,930
as stupid as they are have actually put
you on Microsoft Azure Cloud servers

instead of this hypothetical person box
 

6225
01:58:41,159 --> 01:58:43,550
instead of this hypothetical person box
that's what happens when the aliens are

01:58:43,550 --> 01:58:43,560
that's what happens when the aliens are
 

6227
01:58:43,560 --> 01:58:44,930
that's what happens when the aliens are

stupid
 

6229
01:58:44,940 --> 01:58:47,330
stupid
well but this is not AGI right this is

6230
01:58:47,330 --> 01:58:47,340
well but this is not AGI right this is
 

6231
01:58:47,340 --> 01:58:49,250
well but this is not AGI right this is
the early versions of the system as as

the early versions of the system as as
 

6233
01:58:49,260 --> 01:58:51,950
the early versions of the system as as
you start to yeah they you think that

01:58:51,950 --> 01:58:51,960
you start to yeah they you think that
 

6235
01:58:51,960 --> 01:58:54,229
you start to yeah they you think that
they've got like a plan where like they

6236
01:58:54,229 --> 01:58:54,239
they've got like a plan where like they
 

6237
01:58:54,239 --> 01:58:56,570
they've got like a plan where like they
have declared a a threshold level of

6238
01:58:56,570 --> 01:58:56,580
have declared a a threshold level of
 

6239
01:58:56,580 --> 01:58:57,890
have declared a a threshold level of
capabilities where past that

6240
01:58:57,890 --> 01:58:57,900
capabilities where past that
 

6241
01:58:57,900 --> 01:58:59,270
capabilities where past that
capabilities they move it off the cloud

6242
01:58:59,270 --> 01:58:59,280
capabilities they move it off the cloud
 

6243
01:58:59,280 --> 01:59:00,890
capabilities they move it off the cloud
servers and onto something that's air

6244
01:59:00,890 --> 01:59:00,900

gapped ha ha

6246
01:59:03,649 --> 01:59:03,659
gapped ha ha
 

6247
01:59:03,659 --> 01:59:05,689
gapped ha ha
I think there's a lot of people and

6248
01:59:05,689 --> 01:59:05,699
I think there's a lot of people and
 

6249
01:59:05,699 --> 01:59:08,330
I think there's a lot of people and
you're an important voice here there's a

6250
01:59:08,330 --> 01:59:08,340
you're an important voice here there's a
 

6251
01:59:08,340 --> 01:59:09,709
you're an important voice here there's a
lot of people that have that concern and

6252
01:59:09,709 --> 01:59:09,719
lot of people that have that concern and
 

6253
01:59:09,719 --> 01:59:11,810
lot of people that have that concern and
yes they will do that when there's an

6254
01:59:11,810 --> 01:59:11,820
yes they will do that when there's an
 

6255
01:59:11,820 --> 01:59:13,729
yes they will do that when there's an
uprising of public opinion the debt

6256
01:59:13,729 --> 01:59:13,739
uprising of public opinion the debt
 

6257
01:59:13,739 --> 01:59:15,890
uprising of public opinion the debt
needs to be done and when there's actual

01:59:15,890 --> 01:59:15,900
needs to be done and when there's actual
 

6259
01:59:15,900 --> 01:59:18,050
needs to be done and when there's actual
little damage done with the holy

6260
01:59:18,050 --> 01:59:18,060
little damage done with the holy
 

6261
01:59:18,060 --> 01:59:21,050

this system is beginning to manipulate
 

6263
01:59:21,060 --> 01:59:23,209
this system is beginning to manipulate
people then there's going to be an

6264
01:59:23,209 --> 01:59:23,219
people then there's going to be an
 

6265
01:59:23,219 --> 01:59:25,910
people then there's going to be an
uprising where there's going to be a

6266
01:59:25,910 --> 01:59:25,920
uprising where there's going to be a
 

6267
01:59:25,920 --> 01:59:28,250
uprising where there's going to be a
public pressure

6268
01:59:28,250 --> 01:59:28,260
public pressure
 

6269
01:59:28,260 --> 01:59:30,410
public pressure
and a public incentive in terms of

01:59:30,410 --> 01:59:30,420
and a public incentive in terms of
 

6271
01:59:30,420 --> 01:59:32,570
and a public incentive in terms of

01:59:34,129 --> 01:59:34,139
switch or developing aggressive
 

6275
01:59:34,139 --> 01:59:36,470
switch or developing aggressive
alignment mechanisms and no you're not

6276
01:59:36,470 --> 01:59:36,480
alignment mechanisms and no you're not
 

6277
01:59:36,480 --> 01:59:38,149
alignment mechanisms and no you're not
allowed to put on Azure aggressive

6278
01:59:38,149 --> 01:59:38,159
allowed to put on Azure aggressive
 

6279
01:59:38,159 --> 01:59:39,530
allowed to put on Azure aggressive
alignment mechanism for hell's

6280

alignment mechanism for hell's
 

6281
01:59:39,540 --> 01:59:41,149
alignment mechanism for hell's
aggressive alignment mechanisms like it

6282
01:59:41,149 --> 01:59:41,159
aggressive alignment mechanisms like it
 

6283
01:59:41,159 --> 01:59:42,470
aggressive alignment mechanisms like it
doesn't matter if you say aggressive we

6284
01:59:42,470 --> 01:59:42,480
doesn't matter if you say aggressive we
 

6285
01:59:42,480 --> 01:59:43,790
doesn't matter if you say aggressive we
don't know how to do it

6286
01:59:43,790 --> 01:59:43,800
don't know how to do it
 

6287
01:59:43,800 --> 01:59:46,250
don't know how to do it
meaning aggressive alignment meaning you

6288
01:59:46,250 --> 01:59:46,260
meaning aggressive alignment meaning you
 

6289
01:59:46,260 --> 01:59:47,629
meaning aggressive alignment meaning you
have to

6290
01:59:47,629 --> 01:59:47,639
have to
 

6291
01:59:47,639 --> 01:59:50,510
have to
propose something otherwise you're not

6292
01:59:50,510 --> 01:59:50,520
propose something otherwise you're not
 

6293
01:59:50,520 --> 01:59:53,750
propose something otherwise you're not
allowed to put it on the cloud

6294
01:59:53,750 --> 01:59:53,760

 

6295
01:59:53,760 --> 01:59:55,970

the hell do you do you imagine they will

6296
01:59:55,970 --> 01:59:55,980
the hell do you do you imagine they will
 

6297
01:59:55,980 --> 01:59:57,649
the hell do you do you imagine they will
propose that would make it safe to put

6298
01:59:57,649 --> 01:59:57,659
propose that would make it safe to put
 

6299
01:59:57,659 --> 01:59:59,149
propose that would make it safe to put
something smarter than you on the cloud

6300
01:59:59,149 --> 01:59:59,159
something smarter than you on the cloud
 

6301
01:59:59,159 --> 02:00:01,310
something smarter than you on the cloud
that's what research is for why the

6302
02:00:01,310 --> 02:00:01,320
that's what research is for why the
 

6303
02:00:01,320 --> 02:00:03,290
that's what research is for why the
cynicism about such a thing not being

02:00:03,290 --> 02:00:03,300
cynicism about such a thing not being
 

6305
02:00:03,300 --> 02:00:05,209
cynicism about such a thing not being
possible if you haven't done it works on

02:00:06,530 --> 02:00:06,540
the first try
 

6309
02:00:06,540 --> 02:00:08,990
the first try
what so yes so yes again something

6310
02:00:08,990 --> 02:00:09,000
what so yes so yes again something
 

6311
02:00:09,000 --> 02:00:11,450
what so yes so yes again something
smarter than you so that's that is a

6312
02:00:11,450 --> 02:00:11,460
smarter than you so that's that is a
 

6313
02:00:11,460 --> 02:00:13,250
smarter than you so that's that is a
fundamental thing if it has to work on

6314
02:00:13,250 --> 02:00:13,260
fundamental thing if it has to work on
 

6315
02:00:13,260 --> 02:00:15,410
fundamental thing if it has to work on
the first if there's if if there's a

rapid takeoff
 

6319
02:00:16,980 --> 02:00:19,310
rapid takeoff
yes it's very difficult to do if there's

6320
02:00:19,310 --> 02:00:19,320
yes it's very difficult to do if there's
 

6321
02:00:19,320 --> 02:00:20,870
yes it's very difficult to do if there's
a rapid takeoff and the fundamental

6325
02:00:22,860 --> 02:00:24,589

agis you're saying that's going to be

6326
02:00:24,589 --> 02:00:24,599
agis you're saying that's going to be
 

6327
02:00:24,599 --> 02:00:26,330
agis you're saying that's going to be
extremely difficult to do if the public

Uprising never happens until you have

6330
02:00:29,209 --> 02:00:29,219
Uprising never happens until you have
 

6331
02:00:29,219 --> 02:00:31,550
Uprising never happens until you have
this critical phase shift then you're

6332
02:00:31,550 --> 02:00:31,560
this critical phase shift then you're
 

6333
02:00:31,560 --> 02:00:33,649
this critical phase shift then you're
right it's very difficult to do but

6334
02:00:33,649 --> 02:00:33,659
right it's very difficult to do but
 

6335
02:00:33,659 --> 02:00:35,629
right it's very difficult to do but
that's not obvious it's not obvious that

6336
02:00:35,629 --> 02:00:35,639
that's not obvious it's not obvious that
 

6337
02:00:35,639 --> 02:00:36,890
that's not obvious it's not obvious that
you're not going to start seeing

6338
02:00:36,890 --> 02:00:36,900
you're not going to start seeing
 

6339
02:00:36,900 --> 02:00:38,930
you're not going to start seeing
symptoms of the negative effects of AGI

6340
02:00:38,930 --> 02:00:38,940
symptoms of the negative effects of AGI
 

6341
02:00:38,940 --> 02:00:40,250
symptoms of the negative effects of AGI
to where you're like we have to put a

6342
02:00:40,250 --> 02:00:40,260
to where you're like we have to put a
 

6343
02:00:40,260 --> 02:00:42,350
to where you're like we have to put a
halt to this that there's not just first

6344
02:00:42,350 --> 02:00:42,360
halt to this that there's not just first
 

6345
02:00:42,360 --> 02:00:45,890
halt to this that there's not just first
try you get many tries at it yeah we can

6346
02:00:45,890 --> 02:00:45,900
try you get many tries at it yeah we can
 

6347
02:00:45,900 --> 02:00:49,189
try you get many tries at it yeah we can
like see right now that Bing is quite

6348
02:00:49,189 --> 02:00:49,199
like see right now that Bing is quite
 

6349
02:00:49,199 --> 02:00:51,830
like see right now that Bing is quite
difficult to align that when you try to

6350
02:00:51,830 --> 02:00:51,840
difficult to align that when you try to
 

6351
02:00:51,840 --> 02:00:54,950
difficult to align that when you try to
train inabilities into a system

6352
02:00:54,950 --> 02:00:54,960
train inabilities into a system
 

6353
02:00:54,960 --> 02:00:56,810
train inabilities into a system
into which capabilities have already

into which capabilities have already
 

6355
02:00:56,820 --> 02:00:58,669
into which capabilities have already
been trained that what do you know

6356
02:00:58,669 --> 02:00:58,679
been trained that what do you know
 

6357
02:00:58,679 --> 02:01:01,250
been trained that what do you know
gradient descent like learns small

02:01:03,770 --> 02:01:03,780
shallow simple patches of inability and
 

6361
02:01:03,780 --> 02:01:05,089
shallow simple patches of inability and
you come in and ask it in a different

you come in and ask it in a different
 

6363
02:01:05,099 --> 02:01:07,129
you come in and ask it in a different
language and the Deep capabilities are

6364
02:01:07,129 --> 02:01:07,139

6365
02:01:07,139 --> 02:01:08,450

02:01:08,460 --> 02:01:10,189
still in there and they evade the
shallow patches and come right back out

6368
02:01:10,189 --> 02:01:10,199
shallow patches and come right back out
 

6369
02:01:10,199 --> 02:01:11,990
shallow patches and come right back out
again there there you go there's there's

6370
02:01:11,990 --> 02:01:12,000
again there there you go there's there's
 

6371
02:01:12,000 --> 02:01:14,390
again there there you go there's there's
your there's your red fire alarm of like

6372
02:01:14,390 --> 02:01:14,400
your there's your red fire alarm of like
 

6373
02:01:14,400 --> 02:01:16,609
your there's your red fire alarm of like
oh no alignment is difficult is

6374
02:01:16,609 --> 02:01:16,619
oh no alignment is difficult is
 

6375
02:01:16,619 --> 02:01:17,810
oh no alignment is difficult is
everybody going to shut everything down

6376
02:01:17,810 --> 02:01:17,820
everybody going to shut everything down
 

6377
02:01:17,820 --> 02:01:18,890
everybody going to shut everything down
now

6378
02:01:18,890 --> 02:01:18,900
now
 

6379
02:01:18,900 --> 02:01:20,750
now
no that's not but that's not the same

6380
02:01:20,750 --> 02:01:20,760
no that's not but that's not the same
 

6381
02:01:20,760 --> 02:01:23,030
no that's not but that's not the same
kind of alignment A system that escapes

6382
02:01:23,030 --> 02:01:23,040
kind of alignment A system that escapes
 

6383
02:01:23,040 --> 02:01:25,669
kind of alignment A system that escapes
the box it's from is a fundamentally

6384
02:01:25,669 --> 02:01:25,679
the box it's from is a fundamentally
 

6385
02:01:25,679 --> 02:01:28,970
the box it's from is a fundamentally
different thing I think for you yeah no

6386
02:01:28,970 --> 02:01:28,980
different thing I think for you yeah no
 

6387
02:01:28,980 --> 02:01:30,770
different thing I think for you yeah no
but not for this so you put a line there

6388
02:01:30,770 --> 02:01:30,780
but not for this so you put a line there
 

6389
02:01:30,780 --> 02:01:32,330
but not for this so you put a line there
and everybody else puts a line somewhere

6390
02:01:32,330 --> 02:01:32,340
and everybody else puts a line somewhere
 

6391
02:01:32,340 --> 02:01:34,490
and everybody else puts a line somewhere
else and there's like yeah and there's

6392
02:01:34,490 --> 02:01:34,500
else and there's like yeah and there's
 

6393
02:01:34,500 --> 02:01:35,990
else and there's like yeah and there's
like no agreement

6394
02:01:35,990 --> 02:01:36,000
like no agreement
 

6395
02:01:36,000 --> 02:01:40,910

there was definitely cover-up we don't
 

6405
02:01:50,520 --> 02:01:52,250
there was definitely cover-up we don't
know that if there was a lab leak but we

6406
02:01:52,250 --> 02:01:52,260
know that if there was a lab leak but we
 

6407
02:01:52,260 --> 02:01:53,750
know that if there was a lab leak but we
know that the people who did the

know that the people who did the
 

6409
02:01:53,760 --> 02:01:56,390
know that the people who did the
research like you know like put out the

6410

research like you know like put out the
 

6411
02:01:56,400 --> 02:01:57,890

whole paper about this definitely wasn't

whole paper about this definitely wasn't
 

6413
02:01:57,900 --> 02:01:59,990
whole paper about this definitely wasn't
a lab leak and didn't reveal that they

a lab leak and didn't reveal that they
 

6415

a lab leak and didn't reveal that they
had been doing had like sent off Corona

and
the same people who exported gain of

the same people who exported gain of
 

6431

the woonhan Institute of virology after
 

6435
02:02:19,980 --> 02:02:21,530
the woonhan Institute of virology after
it began to function that gained event

6436
02:02:21,530 --> 02:02:21,540
it began to function that gained event
 

6437
02:02:21,540 --> 02:02:23,030
it began to function that gained event
gain of function research was

are now getting more grants

6442
02:02:27,290 --> 02:02:27,300
are now getting more grants
 

6443
02:02:27,300 --> 02:02:29,689
are now getting more grants
to do more research on a gain of

6444
02:02:29,689 --> 02:02:29,699
to do more research on a gain of
 

6445
02:02:29,699 --> 02:02:32,030
to do more research on a gain of

function research on coronaviruses
maybe we do better in this than in AI

6448
02:02:34,430 --> 02:02:34,440
maybe we do better in this than in AI
 

6449
02:02:34,440 --> 02:02:36,290
maybe we do better in this than in AI
but like this is not something we cannot

6450
02:02:36,290 --> 02:02:36,300
but like this is not something we cannot
 

6451
02:02:36,300 --> 02:02:37,790
but like this is not something we cannot
take for granted that there's going to

6452
02:02:37,790 --> 02:02:37,800
take for granted that there's going to
 

6453
02:02:37,800 --> 02:02:38,990
take for granted that there's going to
be an outcry

6454
02:02:38,990 --> 02:02:39,000
be an outcry
 

6455
02:02:39,000 --> 02:02:40,790
be an outcry
yeah people have different thresholds

6456
02:02:40,790 --> 02:02:40,800
yeah people have different thresholds
 

6457
02:02:40,800 --> 02:02:43,850
yeah people have different thresholds
for when they start to outcry

6458
02:02:43,850 --> 02:02:43,860
for when they start to outcry
 

6459
02:02:43,860 --> 02:02:46,850
for when they start to outcry
PT for granted but I I think your

6460
02:02:46,850 --> 02:02:46,860
PT for granted but I I think your
 

6461
02:02:46,860 --> 02:02:48,950
PT for granted but I I think your
intuition is that there's a very high

6462
02:02:48,950 --> 02:02:48,960
intuition is that there's a very high
 

6463
02:02:48,960 --> 02:02:50,510
intuition is that there's a very high
probability that this event happens

6464
02:02:50,510 --> 02:02:50,520
probability that this event happens
 

6465
02:02:50,520 --> 02:02:52,490
probability that this event happens
without us solving the alignment problem

6466
02:02:52,490 --> 02:02:52,500
without us solving the alignment problem
 

6467
02:02:52,500 --> 02:02:54,530
without us solving the alignment problem
and I guess that's where I'm trying to

6468
02:02:54,530 --> 02:02:54,540
and I guess that's where I'm trying to
 

6469
02:02:54,540 --> 02:02:58,250
and I guess that's where I'm trying to
build up more uh perspectives and color

6470
02:02:58,250 --> 02:02:58,260
build up more uh perspectives and color
 

6471
02:02:58,260 --> 02:03:00,229
build up more uh perspectives and color
on the situation is it possible that the

6472
02:03:00,229 --> 02:03:00,239
on the situation is it possible that the
 

6473
02:03:00,239 --> 02:03:02,169
on the situation is it possible that the
probability is not something like 100

6474
02:03:02,169 --> 02:03:02,179
probability is not something like 100
 

6475
02:03:02,179 --> 02:03:06,410
probability is not something like 100
but it's like 32 percent

6476
02:03:06,410 --> 02:03:06,420
but it's like 32 percent
 

6477
02:03:06,420 --> 02:03:10,250
but it's like 32 percent
that uh AI will escape the Box before we

6478
02:03:10,250 --> 02:03:10,260
that uh AI will escape the Box before we
 

6479
02:03:10,260 --> 02:03:12,290
that uh AI will escape the Box before we
solve the alignment problem not solve

6480
02:03:12,290 --> 02:03:12,300
solve the alignment problem not solve
 

6481
02:03:12,300 --> 02:03:15,229
solve the alignment problem not solve
but is it possible we always stay ahead

6482
02:03:15,229 --> 02:03:15,239
but is it possible we always stay ahead
 

6483
02:03:15,239 --> 02:03:19,430
but is it possible we always stay ahead
of the AI in terms of our ability to

6484
02:03:19,430 --> 02:03:19,440
of the AI in terms of our ability to
 

6485
02:03:19,440 --> 02:03:21,350
of the AI in terms of our ability to
solve for that particular system the

6486
02:03:21,350 --> 02:03:21,360
solve for that particular system the
 

6487
02:03:21,360 --> 02:03:23,689
solve for that particular system the
alignment problem nothing like the world

6488
02:03:23,689 --> 02:03:23,699
alignment problem nothing like the world
 

6489
02:03:23,699 --> 02:03:25,370
alignment problem nothing like the world
in front of us right now

6490
02:03:25,370 --> 02:03:25,380
in front of us right now
 

6491
02:03:25,380 --> 02:03:28,870
in front of us right now
you've already seen it that that that

6492
02:03:28,870 --> 02:03:28,880
you've already seen it that that that
 

6493
02:03:28,880 --> 02:03:32,209
you've already seen it that that that
gpt4 is not turning out this way

6494
02:03:32,209 --> 02:03:32,219
gpt4 is not turning out this way
 

6495
02:03:32,219 --> 02:03:36,589
gpt4 is not turning out this way
and there are like basic obstacles where

6496
02:03:36,589 --> 02:03:36,599
and there are like basic obstacles where
 

6497
02:03:36,599 --> 02:03:38,689
and there are like basic obstacles where
you've got the the weak version of the

you've got the the weak version of the
 

6499
02:03:38,699 --> 02:03:40,010
you've got the the weak version of the
system that doesn't know enough to

02:03:40,010 --> 02:03:40,020
system that doesn't know enough to
 

6501
02:03:40,020 --> 02:03:41,450
system that doesn't know enough to
deceive you and the strong version of

02:03:41,450 --> 02:03:41,460
deceive you and the strong version of
 

6503
02:03:41,460 --> 02:03:43,790
deceive you and the strong version of
the system that could deceive you if it

6504
02:03:43,790 --> 02:03:43,800
the system that could deceive you if it
 

6505
02:03:43,800 --> 02:03:45,229
the system that could deceive you if it
wanted to do that it feels already like

6506
02:03:45,229 --> 02:03:45,239
wanted to do that it feels already like
 

6507
02:03:45,239 --> 02:03:46,609
wanted to do that it feels already like

sufficiently unaligned to want to
 

6509
02:03:46,619 --> 02:03:49,490
sufficiently unaligned to want to
deceive you there's the question of like

6510
02:03:49,490 --> 02:03:49,500
deceive you there's the question of like
 

6511
02:03:49,500 --> 02:03:51,530
deceive you there's the question of like
how on the current Paradigm you train

6512
02:03:51,530 --> 02:03:51,540
how on the current Paradigm you train
 

6513
02:03:51,540 --> 02:03:53,270
how on the current Paradigm you train
honesty when the humans can no longer

honesty when the humans can no longer

6517
02:03:57,440 --> 02:03:59,450

you don't think these are research

you don't think these are research

you don't think these are research
questions that could be answered I think

6520
02:04:01,250 --> 02:04:01,260
questions that could be answered I think
 

6521
02:04:01,260 --> 02:04:02,930
questions that could be answered I think
they could be answered at 50 years with

guess you want to bet me on that
 

6645
02:06:22,560 --> 02:06:24,229
guess you want to bet me on that
but you want to put a time scale on it

02:06:24,229 --> 02:06:24,239
but you want to put a time scale on it
 

6647
02:06:24,239 --> 02:06:25,729
but you want to put a time scale on it
say how much funds you think are going

02:07:00,300 --> 02:07:02,330
there is so much in there that we don't
understand there are so many prizes you

6680
02:07:02,330 --> 02:07:02,340
understand there are so many prizes you
 

6681
02:07:02,340 --> 02:07:03,709
understand there are so many prizes you
could do before you you know you could

6682
02:07:03,709 --> 02:07:03,719
could do before you you know you could
 

6683
02:07:03,719 --> 02:07:05,810
could do before you you know you could
you you could you would have enough

6684
02:07:05,810 --> 02:07:05,820
you you could you would have enough
 

6685
02:07:05,820 --> 02:07:07,490
you you could you would have enough
insights that you'd be like oh you know

6686
02:07:07,490 --> 02:07:07,500
insights that you'd be like oh you know
 

6687
02:07:07,500 --> 02:07:08,689
insights that you'd be like oh you know
like well we understand how these

6688
02:07:08,689 --> 02:07:08,699
like well we understand how these
 

6689
02:07:08,699 --> 02:07:10,250
like well we understand how these
systems work we understand how these

6690
02:07:10,250 --> 02:07:10,260
systems work we understand how these
 

6691
02:07:10,260 --> 02:07:11,570
systems work we understand how these
things are doing their outputs we can

6692
02:07:11,570 --> 02:07:11,580
things are doing their outputs we can
 

6693
02:07:11,580 --> 02:07:13,250
things are doing their outputs we can
read their minds now let's try it with

6694
02:07:13,250 --> 02:07:13,260
read their minds now let's try it with
 

6695
02:07:13,260 --> 02:07:15,109
read their minds now let's try it with
the bigger systems yeah we're nowhere

6696
02:07:15,109 --> 02:07:15,119
the bigger systems yeah we're nowhere
 

6697
02:07:15,119 --> 02:07:17,030
the bigger systems yeah we're nowhere
near that you you there's so much

6698
02:07:17,030 --> 02:07:17,040
near that you you there's so much
 

6699
02:07:17,040 --> 02:07:18,530
near that you you there's so much
interpretability work to be done on the

6700
02:07:18,530 --> 02:07:18,540
interpretability work to be done on the
 

6701
02:07:18,540 --> 02:07:20,510
interpretability work to be done on the
weaker versions of the systems so what

6702
02:07:20,510 --> 02:07:20,520
weaker versions of the systems so what
 

6703
02:07:20,520 --> 02:07:23,030
weaker versions of the systems so what
what can you say on the second point you

6704
02:07:23,030 --> 02:07:23,040
what can you say on the second point you
 

6705
02:07:23,040 --> 02:07:27,770
what can you say on the second point you
said to uh uh to Elon Musk on what are

said to uh uh to Elon Musk on what are
 

6707
02:07:27,780 --> 02:07:29,990
said to uh uh to Elon Musk on what are
some ideas what are things you could try

6708
02:07:29,990 --> 02:07:30,000
some ideas what are things you could try
 

6709
02:07:30,000 --> 02:07:32,629
some ideas what are things you could try
I can think of a few things at try you

work on building AIS without emotions
 

6745
02:08:14,040 --> 02:08:16,129
work on building AIS without emotions
because the emotional AIS were the scary

6746
02:08:16,129 --> 02:08:16,139
because the emotional AIS were the scary
 

6747
02:08:16,139 --> 02:08:17,870
because the emotional AIS were the scary
ones you see

6748
02:08:17,870 --> 02:08:17,880
ones you see
 

6749
02:08:17,880 --> 02:08:22,250
ones you see
and some poor person at arpa had come up

6750
02:08:22,250 --> 02:08:22,260
and some poor person at arpa had come up
 

6751
02:08:22,260 --> 02:08:24,770
and some poor person at arpa had come up
with a research proposal whereby this

6752
02:08:24,770 --> 02:08:24,780
with a research proposal whereby this
 

6753

congressman's panic and desire to fund

6754
02:08:26,750 --> 02:08:26,760
congressman's panic and desire to fund
 

6755
02:08:26,760 --> 02:08:29,570
congressman's panic and desire to fund
this thing would go into something that

6756
02:08:29,570 --> 02:08:29,580
this thing would go into something that
 

6757
02:08:29,580 --> 02:08:30,890
this thing would go into something that
the person at arpa thought would be

6758
02:08:30,890 --> 02:08:30,900
the person at arpa thought would be
 

6759
02:08:30,900 --> 02:08:32,330
the person at arpa thought would be
useful and had been munched around to

6760
02:08:32,330 --> 02:08:32,340
useful and had been munched around to
 

6761
02:08:32,340 --> 02:08:33,530
useful and had been munched around to
where it would like sound to the

6762
02:08:33,530 --> 02:08:33,540
where it would like sound to the
 

6763
02:08:33,540 --> 02:08:35,450
where it would like sound to the
congressman like work was happening on

6764
02:08:35,450 --> 02:08:35,460
congressman like work was happening on
 

6765
02:08:35,460 --> 02:08:37,910
congressman like work was happening on
this which you know of course like this

6766
02:08:37,910 --> 02:08:37,920
this which you know of course like this
 

6767
02:08:37,920 --> 02:08:39,530
this which you know of course like this
is just the the congressperson had

6768
02:08:39,530 --> 02:08:39,540
is just the the congressperson had
 

6769
02:08:39,540 --> 02:08:41,990
is just the the congressperson had
misunderstood the problem

6770
02:08:41,990 --> 02:08:42,000
misunderstood the problem
 

6771
02:08:42,000 --> 02:08:43,970
misunderstood the problem
and did not understand where the danger

6772
02:08:43,970 --> 02:08:43,980
and did not understand where the danger
 

6773
02:08:43,980 --> 02:08:45,890
and did not understand where the danger
came from

6774
02:08:45,890 --> 02:08:45,900
came from
 

6775
02:08:45,900 --> 02:08:47,930
came from
and

6776
02:08:47,930 --> 02:08:47,940
and
 

6777
02:08:47,940 --> 02:08:51,109
and
so it's like that the issue is that

6778
02:08:51,109 --> 02:08:51,119
so it's like that the issue is that
 

6779
02:08:51,119 --> 02:08:52,790
so it's like that the issue is that
you could like do this in a certain

6780
02:08:52,790 --> 02:08:52,800
you could like do this in a certain
 

6781
02:08:52,800 --> 02:08:55,490
you could like do this in a certain
precise way and maybe get something like

6782
02:08:55,490 --> 02:08:55,500
precise way and maybe get something like
 

6783
02:08:55,500 --> 02:08:57,109
precise way and maybe get something like
when I say like put up prices on

6784
02:08:57,109 --> 02:08:57,119
when I say like put up prices on
 

6785
02:08:57,119 --> 02:09:00,050
when I say like put up prices on
interpretability I'm not I'm like well

02:09:53,820 --> 02:09:55,729
like you can tell whether or not
interpretability progress has occurred

6838
02:09:55,729 --> 02:09:55,739
interpretability progress has occurred
 

6839
02:09:55,739 --> 02:09:57,890
interpretability progress has occurred
so like if I say Throw money at

6840
02:09:57,890 --> 02:09:57,900
so like if I say Throw money at
 

6841
02:09:57,900 --> 02:09:59,629
so like if I say Throw money at
producing more interpretability there's

6842
02:09:59,629 --> 02:09:59,639
producing more interpretability there's
 

6843
02:09:59,639 --> 02:10:01,669
producing more interpretability there's
like a chance somebody can do it that

6844
02:10:01,669 --> 02:10:01,679
like a chance somebody can do it that
 

6845
02:10:01,679 --> 02:10:02,990
like a chance somebody can do it that
way and like it will actually produce

6846
02:10:02,990 --> 02:10:03,000
way and like it will actually produce
 

6847
02:10:03,000 --> 02:10:05,209
way and like it will actually produce
useful results then the other stuff just

6848
02:10:05,209 --> 02:10:05,219
useful results then the other stuff just
 

6849
02:10:05,219 --> 02:10:07,550
useful results then the other stuff just
blurs off into the like harder to Target

6850
02:10:07,550 --> 02:10:07,560
blurs off into the like harder to Target
 

6851
02:10:07,560 --> 02:10:09,350
blurs off into the like harder to Target
exactly than that

6852
02:10:09,350 --> 02:10:09,360
exactly than that
 

6853
02:10:09,360 --> 02:10:13,250
exactly than that
so sometimes the basics are fun to

6854
02:10:13,250 --> 02:10:13,260
so sometimes the basics are fun to
 

6855
02:10:13,260 --> 02:10:16,070
so sometimes the basics are fun to
explore because they're not so basic

6856
02:10:16,070 --> 02:10:16,080
explore because they're not so basic
 

6857
02:10:16,080 --> 02:10:18,050
explore because they're not so basic

what do you what does it look like what
are we talking about it looks like

02:10:24,530 --> 02:10:24,540
are we talking about it looks like
 

6863
02:10:24,540 --> 02:10:27,970
are we talking about it looks like
we took a much smaller

would expect the larger work kinds of

02:11:13,679 --> 02:11:15,109
would expect the larger work kinds of

6953
02:12:08,940 --> 02:12:11,270

it is definitely a good step one right

it is definitely a good step one right
 

6955
02:12:11,280 --> 02:12:16,550
it is definitely a good step one right
yeah what's step two

02:13:10,440 --> 02:13:12,470
with a few narrow exceptions implies
killing all the humans

7002
02:13:12,470 --> 02:13:12,480
killing all the humans
 

7003
02:13:12,480 --> 02:13:14,330
killing all the humans
but do you think it's possible because

7004
02:13:14,330 --> 02:13:14,340
but do you think it's possible because
 

7005
02:13:14,340 --> 02:13:16,669
but do you think it's possible because
we can do experimentation to discover

7006
02:13:16,669 --> 02:13:16,679
we can do experimentation to discover
 

7007
02:13:16,679 --> 02:13:19,129
we can do experimentation to discover
the source of the desire to kill

7008
02:13:19,129 --> 02:13:19,139
the source of the desire to kill
 

7009
02:13:19,139 --> 02:13:21,589
the source of the desire to kill
I can tell it to you right now is that

7010
02:13:21,589 --> 02:13:21,599
I can tell it to you right now is that
 

7011
02:13:21,599 --> 02:13:23,510
I can tell it to you right now is that
it wants to do something

7012
02:13:23,510 --> 02:13:23,520
it wants to do something
 

7013
02:13:23,520 --> 02:13:26,149
it wants to do something
and the way to get the most of that

7014
02:13:26,149 --> 02:13:26,159
and the way to get the most of that
 

7015
02:13:26,159 --> 02:13:28,550
and the way to get the most of that
thing is to put the universe into a

7016
02:13:28,550 --> 02:13:28,560
thing is to put the universe into a
 

7017
02:13:28,560 --> 02:13:30,229
thing is to put the universe into a
state where there aren't humans

7018
02:13:30,229 --> 02:13:30,239
state where there aren't humans
 

7019
02:13:30,239 --> 02:13:33,470

so is it is it possible to encode

7020
02:13:33,470 --> 02:13:33,480
so is it is it possible to encode
 

7021
02:13:33,480 --> 02:13:35,629
so is it is it possible to encode

arguendo I you know like it happens to

7156
02:16:12,890 --> 02:16:12,900
arguendo I you know like it happens to
 

7157
02:16:12,900 --> 02:16:15,350
arguendo I you know like it happens to
look like a paper clip in retrospect I

7158
02:16:15,350 --> 02:16:15,360
look like a paper clip in retrospect I
 

7159
02:16:15,360 --> 02:16:18,890
look like a paper clip in retrospect I
wish I'd said Tiny molecular spirals or

7160
02:16:18,890 --> 02:16:18,900
wish I'd said Tiny molecular spirals or
 

7161
02:16:18,900 --> 02:16:20,810
wish I'd said Tiny molecular spirals or
like tiny molecular hyperbolic spirals

7162
02:16:20,810 --> 02:16:20,820
like tiny molecular hyperbolic spirals
 

7163
02:16:20,820 --> 02:16:23,270
like tiny molecular hyperbolic spirals
why because I said a tiny molecular

7164
02:16:23,270 --> 02:16:23,280
why because I said a tiny molecular
 

7165
02:16:23,280 --> 02:16:25,850
why because I said a tiny molecular
paper clips this got heard as this got

7166
02:16:25,850 --> 02:16:25,860
paper clips this got heard as this got
 

7167
02:16:25,860 --> 02:16:28,729
paper clips this got heard as this got
then mutated to paper clips this then

7168
02:16:28,729 --> 02:16:28,739
then mutated to paper clips this then
 

7169
02:16:28,739 --> 02:16:31,010
then mutated to paper clips this then
mutated two and the AI was in a

7170
02:16:31,010 --> 02:16:31,020
mutated two and the AI was in a
 

7171
02:16:31,020 --> 02:16:32,410
mutated two and the AI was in a
paperclip Factory

7172
02:16:32,410 --> 02:16:32,420
paperclip Factory
 

7173
02:16:32,420 --> 02:16:35,929
paperclip Factory
so the original story is about how you

7174
02:16:35,929 --> 02:16:35,939
so the original story is about how you
 

7175
02:16:35,939 --> 02:16:37,490
so the original story is about how you
lose control of the system it doesn't

7176
02:16:37,490 --> 02:16:37,500
lose control of the system it doesn't
 

7177
02:16:37,500 --> 02:16:39,469
lose control of the system it doesn't
want what you tried to make it want the

7178
02:16:39,469 --> 02:16:39,479
want what you tried to make it want the
 

7179
02:16:39,479 --> 02:16:41,450
want what you tried to make it want the
thing that that it ends up wanting most

7180
02:16:41,450 --> 02:16:41,460
thing that that it ends up wanting most
 

7181
02:16:41,460 --> 02:16:43,370
thing that that it ends up wanting most
is a thing that even from a very

7182
02:16:43,370 --> 02:16:43,380
is a thing that even from a very
 

7183
02:16:43,380 --> 02:16:45,230
is a thing that even from a very
embracing Cosmopolitan perspective we

7184
02:16:45,230 --> 02:16:45,240
embracing Cosmopolitan perspective we
 

7185
02:16:45,240 --> 02:16:47,209
embracing Cosmopolitan perspective we
think of as having no value and that's

7186
02:16:47,209 --> 02:16:47,219
think of as having no value and that's
 

7187
02:16:47,219 --> 02:16:48,589
think of as having no value and that's
how the value of the future gets

7188
02:16:48,589 --> 02:16:48,599
how the value of the future gets
 

7189
02:16:48,599 --> 02:16:50,929
how the value of the future gets
destroyed then that got changed to a

7190
02:16:50,929 --> 02:16:50,939
destroyed then that got changed to a
 

7191
02:16:50,939 --> 02:16:53,330
destroyed then that got changed to a
fable of like well you made a paperclip

7192
02:16:53,330 --> 02:16:53,340
fable of like well you made a paperclip
 

7193
02:16:53,340 --> 02:16:55,190
fable of like well you made a paperclip
Factory and it did exactly what you

7194
02:16:55,190 --> 02:16:55,200
Factory and it did exactly what you
 

7195
02:16:55,200 --> 02:16:56,929
Factory and it did exactly what you
wanted what you wanted but you asked it

7196
02:16:56,929 --> 02:16:56,939
wanted what you wanted but you asked it
 

7197
02:16:56,939 --> 02:16:58,669
wanted what you wanted but you asked it
to do the wrong thing which is a

7198
02:16:58,669 --> 02:16:58,679
to do the wrong thing which is a
 

7199
02:16:58,679 --> 02:17:05,690
to do the wrong thing which is a
completely different failure

7200
02:17:05,690 --> 02:17:05,700

 

7201
02:17:05,700 --> 02:17:09,709

but those are both concerns to you so

7202
02:17:09,709 --> 02:17:09,719
but those are both concerns to you so
 

7203
02:17:09,719 --> 02:17:11,810
but those are both concerns to you so
that's more than a Brave New World yeah

7204
02:17:11,810 --> 02:17:11,820
that's more than a Brave New World yeah
 

7205
02:17:11,820 --> 02:17:13,910
that's more than a Brave New World yeah
if you can solve the problem of making

7206
02:17:13,910 --> 02:17:13,920
if you can solve the problem of making
 

7207
02:17:13,920 --> 02:17:16,389
if you can solve the problem of making
something want

7208
02:17:16,389 --> 02:17:16,399
something want
 

7209
02:17:16,399 --> 02:17:19,190
something want
exactly what you wanted to want then you

7210
02:17:19,190 --> 02:17:19,200
exactly what you wanted to want then you
 

7211
02:17:19,200 --> 02:17:20,570
exactly what you wanted to want then you
got to deal with the problem of wanting

7212
02:17:20,570 --> 02:17:20,580
got to deal with the problem of wanting
 

7213
02:17:20,580 --> 02:17:22,129
got to deal with the problem of wanting
the right thing

7214
02:17:22,129 --> 02:17:22,139
the right thing
 

7215
02:17:22,139 --> 02:17:23,450
the right thing
But first you have to solve the

7216
02:17:23,450 --> 02:17:23,460
But first you have to solve the
 

7217
02:17:23,460 --> 02:17:25,370
But first you have to solve the
alignment first you have to solve inner

7218
02:17:25,370 --> 02:17:25,380
alignment first you have to solve inner
 

7219
02:17:25,380 --> 02:17:27,469
alignment first you have to solve inner
alignment inner alignment then you get

7220
02:17:27,469 --> 02:17:27,479
alignment inner alignment then you get
 

7221
02:17:27,479 --> 02:17:31,190
alignment inner alignment then you get
to solve outer alignment

7222
02:17:31,190 --> 02:17:31,200

 

7223
02:17:31,200 --> 02:17:33,530

like first you need to be able to point

7224
02:17:33,530 --> 02:17:33,540
like first you need to be able to point
 

7225
02:17:33,540 --> 02:17:35,389
like first you need to be able to point
the insides of the thing in a direction

7226
02:17:35,389 --> 02:17:35,399
the insides of the thing in a direction
 

7227
02:17:35,399 --> 02:17:37,549
the insides of the thing in a direction
and then you get to to deal with whether

7228
02:17:37,549 --> 02:17:37,559
and then you get to to deal with whether
 

7229
02:17:37,559 --> 02:17:40,250
and then you get to to deal with whether
that direction expressed in reality is

7230
02:17:40,250 --> 02:17:40,260
that direction expressed in reality is
 

7231
02:17:40,260 --> 02:17:41,690
that direction expressed in reality is
like the thing that it'll align with the

7232
02:17:41,690 --> 02:17:41,700
like the thing that it'll align with the
 

7233
02:17:41,700 --> 02:17:45,650
like the thing that it'll align with the
thing that you want

7234
02:17:45,650 --> 02:17:45,660

 

7235
02:17:45,660 --> 02:17:47,509

are you scared

7236
02:17:47,509 --> 02:17:47,519
are you scared
 

7237
02:17:47,519 --> 02:17:50,450
are you scared
of this whole thing

7238
02:17:50,450 --> 02:17:50,460
of this whole thing
 

7239
02:17:50,460 --> 02:17:52,849
of this whole thing
probably I

7240
02:17:52,849 --> 02:17:52,859
probably I
 

7241
02:17:52,859 --> 02:17:54,469
probably I
don't really know

7242
02:17:54,469 --> 02:17:54,479
don't really know
 

7243
02:17:54,479 --> 02:17:56,870
don't really know
what gives you hope about this what

7244
02:17:56,870 --> 02:17:56,880
what gives you hope about this what
 

7245
02:17:56,880 --> 02:17:59,450
what gives you hope about this what
possibility of being wrong

7246
02:17:59,450 --> 02:17:59,460
possibility of being wrong
 

7247
02:17:59,460 --> 02:18:01,669
possibility of being wrong
not that you're right but we will

7248
02:18:01,669 --> 02:18:01,679
not that you're right but we will
 

7249
02:18:01,679 --> 02:18:03,610
not that you're right but we will
actually get our act together and

7250
02:18:03,610 --> 02:18:03,620
actually get our act together and
 

7251
02:18:03,620 --> 02:18:06,530
actually get our act together and
allocate a lot of resources to the

7252
02:18:06,530 --> 02:18:06,540
allocate a lot of resources to the
 

7253
02:18:06,540 --> 02:18:09,469
allocate a lot of resources to the
alignment problem well I can easily

7254
02:18:09,469 --> 02:18:09,479
alignment problem well I can easily
 

7255
02:18:09,479 --> 02:18:11,990
alignment problem well I can easily
imagine that at some point this Panic

7256
02:18:11,990 --> 02:18:12,000
imagine that at some point this Panic
 

7257
02:18:12,000 --> 02:18:13,610
imagine that at some point this Panic
expresses itself in the waste of a

7258
02:18:13,610 --> 02:18:13,620
expresses itself in the waste of a
 

7259
02:18:13,620 --> 02:18:14,929
expresses itself in the waste of a
billion dollars

7260
02:18:14,929 --> 02:18:14,939
billion dollars
 

7261
02:18:14,939 --> 02:18:17,209
billion dollars
spending a billion dollars correctly

7262
02:18:17,209 --> 02:18:17,219
spending a billion dollars correctly
 

7263
02:18:17,219 --> 02:18:18,770
spending a billion dollars correctly
that's harder

7264
02:18:18,770 --> 02:18:18,780
that's harder
 

7265
02:18:18,780 --> 02:18:20,450
that's harder
to solve both the inner and the outer

7266
02:18:20,450 --> 02:18:20,460
to solve both the inner and the outer
 

7267
02:18:20,460 --> 02:18:22,969
to solve both the inner and the outer
alignment if you're wrong to solve a

7268
02:18:22,969 --> 02:18:22,979
alignment if you're wrong to solve a
 

7269
02:18:22,979 --> 02:18:24,530
alignment if you're wrong to solve a
number of things yeah number of things

7270
02:18:24,530 --> 02:18:24,540
number of things yeah number of things
 

7271
02:18:24,540 --> 02:18:26,929
number of things yeah number of things
if you're wrong

7272
02:18:26,929 --> 02:18:26,939
if you're wrong
 

7273
02:18:26,939 --> 02:18:29,389
if you're wrong
what why what do you think would be the

7274
02:18:29,389 --> 02:18:29,399
what why what do you think would be the
 

7275
02:18:29,399 --> 02:18:32,750
what why what do you think would be the
reason like 50 years from now not

7276
02:18:32,750 --> 02:18:32,760
reason like 50 years from now not
 

7277
02:18:32,760 --> 02:18:35,330
reason like 50 years from now not
perfectly wrong you know you make a lot

7278
02:18:35,330 --> 02:18:35,340
perfectly wrong you know you make a lot
 

7279
02:18:35,340 --> 02:18:37,129
perfectly wrong you know you make a lot
of really eloquent points you know

7280
02:18:37,129 --> 02:18:37,139
of really eloquent points you know
 

7281
02:18:37,139 --> 02:18:40,790
of really eloquent points you know
there's there's a lot of like shape to

7282
02:18:40,790 --> 02:18:40,800
there's there's a lot of like shape to
 

7283
02:18:40,800 --> 02:18:43,250
there's there's a lot of like shape to
the ideas you express but like if if

7284
02:18:43,250 --> 02:18:43,260
the ideas you express but like if if
 

7285
02:18:43,260 --> 02:18:44,810
the ideas you express but like if if
you're somewhat wrong about some

7286
02:18:44,810 --> 02:18:44,820
you're somewhat wrong about some
 

7287
02:18:44,820 --> 02:18:47,750
you're somewhat wrong about some
fundamental ideas why would that be

7288
02:18:47,750 --> 02:18:47,760
fundamental ideas why would that be
 

7289
02:18:47,760 --> 02:18:50,629
fundamental ideas why would that be
stuff has to be easier than than I think

7290
02:18:50,629 --> 02:18:50,639
stuff has to be easier than than I think
 

7291
02:18:50,639 --> 02:18:51,650
stuff has to be easier than than I think
it is

7292
02:18:51,650 --> 02:18:51,660
it is
 

7293
02:18:51,660 --> 02:18:53,209
it is
you know when the first time you're

7294
02:18:53,209 --> 02:18:53,219
you know when the first time you're
 

7295
02:18:53,219 --> 02:18:54,709
you know when the first time you're
building a rocket

7296
02:18:54,709 --> 02:18:54,719
building a rocket
 

7297
02:18:54,719 --> 02:18:57,830
building a rocket
being wrong is in a certain sense quite

7298
02:18:57,830 --> 02:18:57,840
being wrong is in a certain sense quite
 

7299
02:18:57,840 --> 02:18:58,910
being wrong is in a certain sense quite
easy

7300
02:18:58,910 --> 02:18:58,920
easy
 

7301
02:18:58,920 --> 02:19:00,950
easy
happening to be wrong in a way where the

7302
02:19:00,950 --> 02:19:00,960
happening to be wrong in a way where the
 

7303
02:19:00,960 --> 02:19:02,870
happening to be wrong in a way where the
rocket goes twice as far and half the

7304
02:19:02,870 --> 02:19:02,880
rocket goes twice as far and half the
 

7305
02:19:02,880 --> 02:19:04,669
rocket goes twice as far and half the
fuel and lands exactly where you hoped

7306
02:19:04,669 --> 02:19:04,679
fuel and lands exactly where you hoped
 

7307
02:19:04,679 --> 02:19:06,110
fuel and lands exactly where you hoped
it would

7308
02:19:06,110 --> 02:19:06,120
it would
 

7309
02:19:06,120 --> 02:19:08,690
it would
most cases of being wrong make it harder

7310
02:19:08,690 --> 02:19:08,700
most cases of being wrong make it harder
 

7311
02:19:08,700 --> 02:19:10,250
most cases of being wrong make it harder
to build the rocket harder to have it

7312
02:19:10,250 --> 02:19:10,260
to build the rocket harder to have it
 

7313
02:19:10,260 --> 02:19:12,589
to build the rocket harder to have it
not explode cause it to require more

7314
02:19:12,589 --> 02:19:12,599
not explode cause it to require more
 

7315

of your concern about the threats of AGI
I've talked to her about the power of

7476
02:22:25,250 --> 02:22:25,260
I've talked to her about the power of
 

7477
02:22:25,260 --> 02:22:27,590
I've talked to her about the power of
intelligence and not really gotten very

7478
02:22:27,590 --> 02:22:27,600
intelligence and not really gotten very
 

7479
02:22:27,600 --> 02:22:28,849
intelligence and not really gotten very
far into it

7480
02:22:28,849 --> 02:22:28,859
far into it
 

7481
02:22:28,859 --> 02:22:30,530
far into it
but not like

7482
02:22:30,530 --> 02:22:30,540
but not like
 

7483
02:22:30,540 --> 02:22:33,110
but not like
why it is that suppose you like screw up

7484
02:22:33,110 --> 02:22:33,120
why it is that suppose you like screw up
 

7485
02:22:33,120 --> 02:22:35,630
why it is that suppose you like screw up
with AGI and it ends up wanting a bunch

7486
02:22:35,630 --> 02:22:35,640
with AGI and it ends up wanting a bunch
 

7487
02:22:35,640 --> 02:22:39,830
with AGI and it ends up wanting a bunch
of random stuff why does it try to kill

7488
02:22:39,830 --> 02:22:39,840
of random stuff why does it try to kill
 

7489
02:22:39,840 --> 02:22:42,670
of random stuff why does it try to kill
you why doesn't it try to trade with you

7490
02:22:42,670 --> 02:22:42,680
you why doesn't it try to trade with you
 

7491
02:22:42,680 --> 02:22:45,889
you why doesn't it try to trade with you
why doesn't it give you just the tiny

7492
02:22:45,889 --> 02:22:45,899
why doesn't it give you just the tiny
 

7493
02:22:45,899 --> 02:22:47,450
why doesn't it give you just the tiny
little fraction of the solar system that

7494
02:22:47,450 --> 02:22:47,460
little fraction of the solar system that
 

7495
02:22:47,460 --> 02:22:49,130
little fraction of the solar system that
would keep to take everyone a lot that

7496
02:22:49,130 --> 02:22:49,140
would keep to take everyone a lot that
 

7497
02:22:49,140 --> 02:22:51,770
would keep to take everyone a lot that
it would take to keep everyone alive

7498
02:22:51,770 --> 02:22:51,780
it would take to keep everyone alive
 

7499
02:22:51,780 --> 02:22:53,330
it would take to keep everyone alive
yeah well that's a good question I mean

7500
02:22:53,330 --> 02:22:53,340
yeah well that's a good question I mean
 

7501
02:22:53,340 --> 02:22:54,710
yeah well that's a good question I mean
what what are the different trajectories

7502
02:22:54,710 --> 02:22:54,720
what what are the different trajectories
 

7503
02:22:54,720 --> 02:22:56,150
what what are the different trajectories
that intelligence

7504
02:22:56,150 --> 02:22:56,160
that intelligence
 

7505
02:22:56,160 --> 02:22:58,010
that intelligence
when acted Upon This World Super

7506
02:22:58,010 --> 02:22:58,020
when acted Upon This World Super
 

7507
02:22:58,020 --> 02:22:59,330
when acted Upon This World Super
intelligence what are the different

7508
02:22:59,330 --> 02:22:59,340
intelligence what are the different
 

7509
02:22:59,340 --> 02:23:01,610
intelligence what are the different
trajectories for this universe with such

7510
02:23:01,610 --> 02:23:01,620
trajectories for this universe with such
 

7511
02:23:01,620 --> 02:23:03,530
trajectories for this universe with such
an intelligence in it do most of them

7512
02:23:03,530 --> 02:23:03,540
an intelligence in it do most of them
 

7513
02:23:03,540 --> 02:23:05,270
an intelligence in it do most of them
not include humans

7514
02:23:05,270 --> 02:23:05,280
not include humans
 

7515
02:23:05,280 --> 02:23:08,450
not include humans
I mean if you the vast majority of

7516
02:23:08,450 --> 02:23:08,460
I mean if you the vast majority of
 

7517
02:23:08,460 --> 02:23:10,969
I mean if you the vast majority of
randomly specified utility functions do

7518
02:23:10,969 --> 02:23:10,979
randomly specified utility functions do
 

7519
02:23:10,979 --> 02:23:14,570
randomly specified utility functions do
not have Optima with humans in them

7520
02:23:14,570 --> 02:23:14,580
not have Optima with humans in them
 

7521
02:23:14,580 --> 02:23:17,090
not have Optima with humans in them
would be the like first thing I would

7522
02:23:17,090 --> 02:23:17,100
would be the like first thing I would
 

7523
02:23:17,100 --> 02:23:19,309
would be the like first thing I would
point out and then the next question is

7524
02:23:19,309 --> 02:23:19,319
point out and then the next question is
 

7525
02:23:19,319 --> 02:23:21,170
point out and then the next question is
like well if you try to optimize

7526
02:23:21,170 --> 02:23:21,180
like well if you try to optimize
 

7527
02:23:21,180 --> 02:23:23,570
like well if you try to optimize
something you lose control of it where

7528
02:23:23,570 --> 02:23:23,580
something you lose control of it where
 

7529
02:23:23,580 --> 02:23:25,070
something you lose control of it where
in that space do you land because it's

7530
02:23:25,070 --> 02:23:25,080
in that space do you land because it's
 

7531
02:23:25,080 --> 02:23:27,290
in that space do you land because it's
not random but it also doesn't

7532
02:23:27,290 --> 02:23:27,300
not random but it also doesn't
 

7533
02:23:27,300 --> 02:23:29,630
not random but it also doesn't
necessarily have room for humans in it

7534
02:23:29,630 --> 02:23:29,640
necessarily have room for humans in it
 

7535
02:23:29,640 --> 02:23:32,210
necessarily have room for humans in it
I suspect that the average member of the

7536
02:23:32,210 --> 02:23:32,220
I suspect that the average member of the
 

7537
02:23:32,220 --> 02:23:33,530
I suspect that the average member of the
audience might have some questions about

7538
02:23:33,530 --> 02:23:33,540
audience might have some questions about
 

7539
02:23:33,540 --> 02:23:35,510
audience might have some questions about
even whether that's the correct Paradigm

7540
02:23:35,510 --> 02:23:35,520
even whether that's the correct Paradigm
 

7541
02:23:35,520 --> 02:23:37,429
even whether that's the correct Paradigm
to think about it then would

7542
02:23:37,429 --> 02:23:37,439
to think about it then would
 

7543
02:23:37,439 --> 02:23:40,070
to think about it then would
sort of want to back up a bit if we back

7544
02:23:40,070 --> 02:23:40,080
sort of want to back up a bit if we back
 

7545
02:23:40,080 --> 02:23:42,050
sort of want to back up a bit if we back
up to

7546
02:23:42,050 --> 02:23:42,060
up to
 

7547
02:23:42,060 --> 02:23:44,750
up to
something bigger than humans

7548
02:23:44,750 --> 02:23:44,760
something bigger than humans
 

7549
02:23:44,760 --> 02:23:47,990
something bigger than humans
if you look at Earth and life on Earth

7550
02:23:47,990 --> 02:23:48,000
if you look at Earth and life on Earth
 

7551
02:23:48,000 --> 02:23:50,210
if you look at Earth and life on Earth
and what is truly special about life on

7552
02:23:50,210 --> 02:23:50,220
and what is truly special about life on
 

7553
02:23:50,220 --> 02:23:52,010
and what is truly special about life on
Earth

7554
02:23:52,010 --> 02:23:52,020
Earth
 

7555
02:23:52,020 --> 02:23:55,309
Earth
do you think it's possible that a lot

7556
02:23:55,309 --> 02:23:55,319
do you think it's possible that a lot
 

7557
02:23:55,319 --> 02:23:58,250
do you think it's possible that a lot
whatever that special thing is let's

7558
02:23:58,250 --> 02:23:58,260
whatever that special thing is let's
 

7559
02:23:58,260 --> 02:24:00,410
whatever that special thing is let's
explore what that special thing could be

7560
02:24:00,410 --> 02:24:00,420
explore what that special thing could be
 

7561
02:24:00,420 --> 02:24:02,450
explore what that special thing could be
whatever that special thing is that

7562
02:24:02,450 --> 02:24:02,460
whatever that special thing is that
 

7563
02:24:02,460 --> 02:24:04,969
whatever that special thing is that
thing appears often in the objective

7564

thing appears often in the objective
 

7565
02:24:04,979 --> 02:24:08,050
thing appears often in the objective
function why

7566
02:24:08,050 --> 02:24:08,060
function why
 

7567
02:24:08,060 --> 02:24:11,630
function why
I I know what you hope but

7568
02:24:11,630 --> 02:24:11,640
I I know what you hope but
 

7569
02:24:11,640 --> 02:24:13,550
I I know what you hope but
you know you can hope that a particular

7570
02:24:13,550 --> 02:24:13,560
you know you can hope that a particular
 

7571
02:24:13,560 --> 02:24:15,170
you know you can hope that a particular
set of winning lottery numbers come up

7572
02:24:15,170 --> 02:24:15,180
set of winning lottery numbers come up
 

7573
02:24:15,180 --> 02:24:17,090
set of winning lottery numbers come up
and it doesn't make the lottery balls

7574
02:24:17,090 --> 02:24:17,100
and it doesn't make the lottery balls
 

7575
02:24:17,100 --> 02:24:18,469
and it doesn't make the lottery balls
come up that way

7576
02:24:18,469 --> 02:24:18,479
come up that way
 

7577
02:24:18,479 --> 02:24:20,450
come up that way
I know you want this to be true but why

7578
02:24:20,450 --> 02:24:20,460
I know you want this to be true but why
 

7579
02:24:20,460 --> 02:24:23,150
I know you want this to be true but why
would it be true there's a line from

7580
02:24:23,150 --> 02:24:23,160
would it be true there's a line from
 

7581
02:24:23,160 --> 02:24:26,330
would it be true there's a line from
Grumpy Old Men where this guy says in a

Grumpy Old Men where this guy says in a
 

7583
02:24:26,340 --> 02:24:28,490
Grumpy Old Men where this guy says in a
grocery store he says you can wish in

7584
02:24:28,490 --> 02:24:28,500
grocery store he says you can wish in
 

7585
02:24:28,500 --> 02:24:30,410
grocery store he says you can wish in
one hand and crap in the other and see

7586
02:24:30,410 --> 02:24:30,420
one hand and crap in the other and see
 

7587
02:24:30,420 --> 02:24:32,450
one hand and crap in the other and see
which one fills up first this is a

7588
02:24:32,450 --> 02:24:32,460
which one fills up first this is a

02:24:32,460 --> 02:24:33,889
which one fills up first this is a
science problem we are trying to predict

7590
02:24:33,889 --> 02:24:33,899
science problem we are trying to predict
 

7591
02:24:33,899 --> 02:24:37,670
science problem we are trying to predict
what happens with AI systems that you

7592
02:24:37,670 --> 02:24:37,680
what happens with AI systems that you
 

7593
02:24:37,680 --> 02:24:40,490
what happens with AI systems that you
know you try to optimize to imitate

7594
02:24:40,490 --> 02:24:40,500
know you try to optimize to imitate
 

7595
02:24:40,500 --> 02:24:42,710
know you try to optimize to imitate
humans and then you did some like rlhf

7596
02:24:42,710 --> 02:24:42,720
humans and then you did some like rlhf
 

7597
02:24:42,720 --> 02:24:45,230
humans and then you did some like rlhf
to them and of course you like lost in

7598
02:24:45,230 --> 02:24:45,240
to them and of course you like lost in
 

7599
02:24:45,240 --> 02:24:46,429
to them and of course you like lost in
and you know like of course you didn't

7600
02:24:46,429 --> 02:24:46,439
and you know like of course you didn't
 

7601
02:24:46,439 --> 02:24:48,050
and you know like of course you didn't
get like perfect alignment because

7602
02:24:48,050 --> 02:24:48,060
get like perfect alignment because
 

7603
02:24:48,060 --> 02:24:50,750
get like perfect alignment because
that's not how you know

7604
02:24:50,750 --> 02:24:50,760
that's not how you know
 

7605
02:24:50,760 --> 02:24:52,130
that's not how you know
it's not what happens when you Hill

7606
02:24:52,130 --> 02:24:52,140
it's not what happens when you Hill
 

7607
02:24:52,140 --> 02:24:54,230
it's not what happens when you Hill
Climb towards the outer loss function

7608
02:24:54,230 --> 02:24:54,240
Climb towards the outer loss function
 

7609
02:24:54,240 --> 02:24:56,690
Climb towards the outer loss function
you don't get inter alignment on it

7610
02:24:56,690 --> 02:24:56,700
you don't get inter alignment on it
 

7611
02:24:56,700 --> 02:25:01,330
you don't get inter alignment on it
but yeah so

7612
02:25:01,330 --> 02:25:01,340

 

7613
02:25:01,340 --> 02:25:04,429

the I think that there's so if you don't

7614
02:25:04,429 --> 02:25:04,439
the I think that there's so if you don't
 

7615
02:25:04,439 --> 02:25:05,990
the I think that there's so if you don't
mind my like taking some slight control

7616
02:25:05,990 --> 02:25:06,000
mind my like taking some slight control
 

7617
02:25:06,000 --> 02:25:07,730
mind my like taking some slight control
of things and staring around to what I

7618
02:25:07,730 --> 02:25:07,740
of things and staring around to what I
 

7619
02:25:07,740 --> 02:25:10,130
of things and staring around to what I
think is like a good place to start

7620
02:25:10,130 --> 02:25:10,140
think is like a good place to start
 

7621
02:25:10,140 --> 02:25:11,630
think is like a good place to start
I just failed to solve the control

7622
02:25:11,630 --> 02:25:11,640
I just failed to solve the control
 

7623
02:25:11,640 --> 02:25:12,650
I just failed to solve the control
problem

7624
02:25:12,650 --> 02:25:12,660
problem
 

7625
02:25:12,660 --> 02:25:14,030
problem
I've lost control of this thing

7626
02:25:14,030 --> 02:25:14,040
I've lost control of this thing
 

7627
02:25:14,040 --> 02:25:16,330
I've lost control of this thing
alignment alignment

7628
02:25:16,330 --> 02:25:16,340
alignment alignment
 

7629
02:25:16,340 --> 02:25:19,250
alignment alignment
still alive control yeah okay sure yeah

7630
02:25:19,250 --> 02:25:19,260
still alive control yeah okay sure yeah
 

7631
02:25:19,260 --> 02:25:20,570
still alive control yeah okay sure yeah
you lost control

7632
02:25:20,570 --> 02:25:20,580
you lost control
 

7633
02:25:20,580 --> 02:25:23,150
you lost control
um but we're still aligned anyway sorry

7634
02:25:23,150 --> 02:25:23,160
um but we're still aligned anyway sorry
 

7635
02:25:23,160 --> 02:25:25,190
um but we're still aligned anyway sorry
for the meta comment yeah losing control

7636
02:25:25,190 --> 02:25:25,200
for the meta comment yeah losing control
 

7637
02:25:25,200 --> 02:25:27,050
for the meta comment yeah losing control
isn't as bad as you lose control to an

7638
02:25:27,050 --> 02:25:27,060
isn't as bad as you lose control to an
 

7639
02:25:27,060 --> 02:25:29,210
isn't as bad as you lose control to an
aligned system yes exactly exactly you

7640
02:25:29,210 --> 02:25:29,220
aligned system yes exactly exactly you
 

7641
02:25:29,220 --> 02:25:31,010
aligned system yes exactly exactly you
have no idea of the horrors I will

7642
02:25:31,010 --> 02:25:31,020
have no idea of the horrors I will
 

7643
02:25:31,020 --> 02:25:34,130
have no idea of the horrors I will
shortly at least on this conversation

7644
02:25:34,130 --> 02:25:34,140
shortly at least on this conversation
 

7645
02:25:34,140 --> 02:25:36,290
shortly at least on this conversation
all right so it's actually

7646
02:25:36,290 --> 02:25:36,300
all right so it's actually
 

7647
02:25:36,300 --> 02:25:37,849
all right so it's actually
distractically what are we going to say

7648
02:25:37,849 --> 02:25:37,859
distractically what are we going to say
 

7649
02:25:37,859 --> 02:25:39,110
distractically what are we going to say
in terms of taking control of the

7650
02:25:39,110 --> 02:25:39,120
in terms of taking control of the
 

7651
02:25:39,120 --> 02:25:40,250
in terms of taking control of the
conversation

7652
02:25:40,250 --> 02:25:40,260
conversation
 

7653
02:25:40,260 --> 02:25:45,290
conversation
so I think that there's like a

7654
02:25:45,290 --> 02:25:45,300
so I think that there's like a
 

7655
02:25:45,300 --> 02:25:47,510
so I think that there's like a
sealing chapters here if I'm pronouncing

7656
02:25:47,510 --> 02:25:47,520
sealing chapters here if I'm pronouncing
 

7657
02:25:47,520 --> 02:25:48,830
sealing chapters here if I'm pronouncing
those words remotely like correctly

7658
02:25:48,830 --> 02:25:48,840
those words remotely like correctly
 

7659
02:25:48,840 --> 02:25:49,910
those words remotely like correctly
because of course they only ever read

7660
02:25:49,910 --> 02:25:49,920
because of course they only ever read
 

7661
02:25:49,920 --> 02:25:52,790
because of course they only ever read
them and not hear them spoken

7662
02:25:52,790 --> 02:25:52,800
them and not hear them spoken
 

7663
02:25:52,800 --> 02:25:54,590
them and not hear them spoken
um there's

7664
02:25:54,590 --> 02:25:54,600
um there's
 

7665
02:25:54,600 --> 02:25:58,070
um there's
a like for some people like

7666
02:25:58,070 --> 02:25:58,080
a like for some people like
 

7667
02:25:58,080 --> 02:26:01,130
a like for some people like
the word intelligence smartness is not a

7668
02:26:01,130 --> 02:26:01,140
the word intelligence smartness is not a
 

7669
02:26:01,140 --> 02:26:03,830
the word intelligence smartness is not a
word of power to them it means chess

7670
02:26:03,830 --> 02:26:03,840
word of power to them it means chess
 

7671
02:26:03,840 --> 02:26:06,830
word of power to them it means chess
players who it means like the College

7672
02:26:06,830 --> 02:26:06,840
players who it means like the College
 

7673
02:26:06,840 --> 02:26:08,750
players who it means like the College
University Professor people aren't very

7674
02:26:08,750 --> 02:26:08,760
University Professor people aren't very
 

7675
02:26:08,760 --> 02:26:10,389
University Professor people aren't very
successful in life it doesn't mean like

7676
02:26:10,389 --> 02:26:10,399
successful in life it doesn't mean like
 

7677
02:26:10,399 --> 02:26:12,770
successful in life it doesn't mean like
Charisma which my usual thing is like

7678
02:26:12,770 --> 02:26:12,780
Charisma which my usual thing is like
 

7679
02:26:12,780 --> 02:26:14,690
Charisma which my usual thing is like
Charisma is not generated in the liver

7680
02:26:14,690 --> 02:26:14,700
Charisma is not generated in the liver
 

7681
02:26:14,700 --> 02:26:16,490
Charisma is not generated in the liver
rather than the brain Charisma is also a

7682
02:26:16,490 --> 02:26:16,500
rather than the brain Charisma is also a
 

7683
02:26:16,500 --> 02:26:18,950
rather than the brain Charisma is also a
cognitive function

7684
02:26:18,950 --> 02:26:18,960
cognitive function
 

7685
02:26:18,960 --> 02:26:20,870
cognitive function
um

7686
02:26:20,870 --> 02:26:20,880
um
 

7687
02:26:20,880 --> 02:26:23,870
um
so if you if you like think that like

7688
02:26:23,870 --> 02:26:23,880
so if you if you like think that like
 

7689
02:26:23,880 --> 02:26:26,450
so if you if you like think that like
smartness doesn't sound very threatening

7690
02:26:26,450 --> 02:26:26,460
smartness doesn't sound very threatening
 

7691
02:26:26,460 --> 02:26:29,389
smartness doesn't sound very threatening
then super intelligence is not going to

7692
02:26:29,389 --> 02:26:29,399
then super intelligence is not going to
 

7693
02:26:29,399 --> 02:26:30,889
then super intelligence is not going to
sound very threatening either it's going

7694
02:26:30,889 --> 02:26:30,899
sound very threatening either it's going
 

7695
02:26:30,899 --> 02:26:32,150
sound very threatening either it's going
to sound like you just pulled the off

7696
02:26:32,150 --> 02:26:32,160
to sound like you just pulled the off
 

7697
02:26:32,160 --> 02:26:33,830
to sound like you just pulled the off
switch

7698
02:26:33,830 --> 02:26:33,840
switch
 

7699
02:26:33,840 --> 02:26:35,210
switch
like it's you know like well it's super

7700
02:26:35,210 --> 02:26:35,220
like it's you know like well it's super
 

7701
02:26:35,220 --> 02:26:36,590
like it's you know like well it's super
intelligent but stuck in a computer we

7702
02:26:36,590 --> 02:26:36,600
intelligent but stuck in a computer we
 

7703
02:26:36,600 --> 02:26:39,830
intelligent but stuck in a computer we
pull the off switch problem solved

7704
02:26:39,830 --> 02:26:39,840
pull the off switch problem solved
 

7705
02:26:39,840 --> 02:26:42,710
pull the off switch problem solved
and the other side of it is

7706
02:26:42,710 --> 02:26:42,720
and the other side of it is
 

7707
02:26:42,720 --> 02:26:44,450
and the other side of it is
you have a lot of respect for the notion

7708
02:26:44,450 --> 02:26:44,460
you have a lot of respect for the notion
 

7709
02:26:44,460 --> 02:26:46,130
you have a lot of respect for the notion
of intelligence you're like well yeah

7710
02:26:46,130 --> 02:26:46,140
of intelligence you're like well yeah
 

7711
02:26:46,140 --> 02:26:47,630
of intelligence you're like well yeah
that's that's what humans have that's

7712
02:26:47,630 --> 02:26:47,640
that's that's what humans have that's
 

7713
02:26:47,640 --> 02:26:49,429
that's that's what humans have that's
the human superpower

7714
02:26:49,429 --> 02:26:49,439
the human superpower
 

7715
02:26:49,439 --> 02:26:52,550
the human superpower
and it sounds you know like it could be

7716
02:26:52,550 --> 02:26:52,560
and it sounds you know like it could be
 

7717
02:26:52,560 --> 02:26:54,830
and it sounds you know like it could be
dangerous but why would it be

7718
02:26:54,830 --> 02:26:54,840
dangerous but why would it be
 

7719
02:26:54,840 --> 02:26:58,910
dangerous but why would it be
are we have we as we have grown more

7720
02:26:58,910 --> 02:26:58,920
are we have we as we have grown more
 

7721
02:26:58,920 --> 02:27:01,849
are we have we as we have grown more
intelligent also grown less kind

7722
02:27:01,849 --> 02:27:01,859
intelligent also grown less kind
 

7723
02:27:01,859 --> 02:27:04,670
intelligent also grown less kind
Zees are in fact like a bit less kind

7724
02:27:04,670 --> 02:27:04,680
Zees are in fact like a bit less kind
 

7725
02:27:04,680 --> 02:27:07,070
Zees are in fact like a bit less kind
than humans and you know

7726
02:27:07,070 --> 02:27:07,080
than humans and you know
 

7727
02:27:07,080 --> 02:27:09,590
than humans and you know
you could like argue that out but often

7728
02:27:09,590 --> 02:27:09,600
you could like argue that out but often
 

7729
02:27:09,600 --> 02:27:10,849
you could like argue that out but often
the sort of person has a deep respect

7730
02:27:10,849 --> 02:27:10,859
the sort of person has a deep respect
 

7731
02:27:10,859 --> 02:27:11,990
the sort of person has a deep respect
for intelligence is going to be like

7732
02:27:11,990 --> 02:27:12,000
for intelligence is going to be like
 

7733
02:27:12,000 --> 02:27:14,090
for intelligence is going to be like
well yes like you can't even have

7734
02:27:14,090 --> 02:27:14,100
well yes like you can't even have
 

7735
02:27:14,100 --> 02:27:16,910
well yes like you can't even have
kindness unless you know what that is

7736
02:27:16,910 --> 02:27:16,920
kindness unless you know what that is
 

7737
02:27:16,920 --> 02:27:19,250
kindness unless you know what that is
and so they're like

7738
02:27:19,250 --> 02:27:19,260
and so they're like
 

7739
02:27:19,260 --> 02:27:21,530
and so they're like
why would it do something as stupid as

7740
02:27:21,530 --> 02:27:21,540
why would it do something as stupid as
 

7741
02:27:21,540 --> 02:27:22,910
why would it do something as stupid as
making paper clips

7742
02:27:22,910 --> 02:27:22,920
making paper clips
 

7743
02:27:22,920 --> 02:27:25,370
making paper clips
aren't you supposing something that's

7744
02:27:25,370 --> 02:27:25,380
aren't you supposing something that's
 

7745
02:27:25,380 --> 02:27:27,110
aren't you supposing something that's
smart enough to be dangerous but also

7746
02:27:27,110 --> 02:27:27,120
smart enough to be dangerous but also
 

7747
02:27:27,120 --> 02:27:28,849
smart enough to be dangerous but also
stupid enough that it will just make

7748
02:27:28,849 --> 02:27:28,859
stupid enough that it will just make
 

7749
02:27:28,859 --> 02:27:31,330
stupid enough that it will just make
paper clips and never question that

7750
02:27:31,330 --> 02:27:31,340
paper clips and never question that
 

7751
02:27:31,340 --> 02:27:34,849
paper clips and never question that
in some cases people are like well even

7752
02:27:34,849 --> 02:27:34,859
in some cases people are like well even
 

7753
02:27:34,859 --> 02:27:37,250
in some cases people are like well even
if you like mispecify the objective

7754
02:27:37,250 --> 02:27:37,260
if you like mispecify the objective
 

7755
02:27:37,260 --> 02:27:39,050
if you like mispecify the objective
function won't you realize that what you

7756
02:27:39,050 --> 02:27:39,060
function won't you realize that what you
 

7757
02:27:39,060 --> 02:27:41,809
function won't you realize that what you
really wanted was X are you supposing

7758
02:27:41,809 --> 02:27:41,819
really wanted was X are you supposing
 

7759
02:27:41,819 --> 02:27:43,550
really wanted was X are you supposing
something that is like

7760
02:27:43,550 --> 02:27:43,560
something that is like
 

7761
02:27:43,560 --> 02:27:46,250
something that is like
smart enough to be dangerous but stupid

7762
02:27:46,250 --> 02:27:46,260
smart enough to be dangerous but stupid
 

7763
02:27:46,260 --> 02:27:48,290
smart enough to be dangerous but stupid
enough that it doesn't understand what

7764
02:27:48,290 --> 02:27:48,300
enough that it doesn't understand what
 

7765
02:27:48,300 --> 02:27:49,730
enough that it doesn't understand what
the humans really meant when they

7766
02:27:49,730 --> 02:27:49,740
the humans really meant when they
 

7767
02:27:49,740 --> 02:27:52,190
the humans really meant when they
specified the objective function

7768
02:27:52,190 --> 02:27:52,200
specified the objective function
 

7769
02:27:52,200 --> 02:27:53,270
specified the objective function
so

7770
02:27:53,270 --> 02:27:53,280
so
 

7771
02:27:53,280 --> 02:27:55,969
so
to you our intuition about intelligence

7772
02:27:55,969 --> 02:27:55,979
to you our intuition about intelligence
 

7773
02:27:55,979 --> 02:27:58,190
to you our intuition about intelligence
is limited we should think about

7774
02:27:58,190 --> 02:27:58,200
is limited we should think about
 

7775
02:27:58,200 --> 02:28:00,410
is limited we should think about
intelligence as a much bigger thing

7776
02:28:00,410 --> 02:28:00,420
intelligence as a much bigger thing
 

7777
02:28:00,420 --> 02:28:03,230
intelligence as a much bigger thing
well I'm saying that it's that then well

7778
02:28:03,230 --> 02:28:03,240
well I'm saying that it's that then well
 

7779
02:28:03,240 --> 02:28:05,150
well I'm saying that it's that then well
what I'm saying is like

7780
02:28:05,150 --> 02:28:05,160
what I'm saying is like
 

7781
02:28:05,160 --> 02:28:07,130
what I'm saying is like
what you think about artificial

7782
02:28:07,130 --> 02:28:07,140
what you think about artificial
 

7783
02:28:07,140 --> 02:28:08,870
what you think about artificial
intelligence

7784
02:28:08,870 --> 02:28:08,880
intelligence
 

7785
02:28:08,880 --> 02:28:10,309
intelligence
um depends on what you think about

7786
02:28:10,309 --> 02:28:10,319
um depends on what you think about
 

7787
02:28:10,319 --> 02:28:12,349
um depends on what you think about
intelligence so how do we think about

7788
02:28:12,349 --> 02:28:12,359
intelligence so how do we think about
 

7789
02:28:12,359 --> 02:28:15,770
intelligence so how do we think about
intelligence correctly like what

7790
02:28:15,770 --> 02:28:15,780
intelligence correctly like what
 

7791
02:28:15,780 --> 02:28:17,809
intelligence correctly like what
you gave one thought experiment to think

7792
02:28:17,809 --> 02:28:17,819
you gave one thought experiment to think
 

7793
02:28:17,819 --> 02:28:19,429
you gave one thought experiment to think
of think of a thing that's much faster

7794
02:28:19,429 --> 02:28:19,439
of think of a thing that's much faster
 

7795
02:28:19,439 --> 02:28:21,230
of think of a thing that's much faster
so it just gets faster and faster and

7796
02:28:21,230 --> 02:28:21,240
so it just gets faster and faster and
 

7797
02:28:21,240 --> 02:28:23,510
so it just gets faster and faster and
faster I think and it also is like is

7798
02:28:23,510 --> 02:28:23,520
faster I think and it also is like is
 

7799
02:28:23,520 --> 02:28:25,130
faster I think and it also is like is
made of John Von Neumann and has like

7800
02:28:25,130 --> 02:28:25,140
made of John Von Neumann and has like
 

7801
02:28:25,140 --> 02:28:26,650
made of John Von Neumann and has like
and there's lots of them

7802
02:28:26,650 --> 02:28:26,660
and there's lots of them
 

7803
02:28:26,660 --> 02:28:28,610
and there's lots of them
because we understand that yeah we

7804
02:28:28,610 --> 02:28:28,620
because we understand that yeah we
 

7805
02:28:28,620 --> 02:28:30,349
because we understand that yeah we
understood like trying to find Newman is

7806
02:28:30,349 --> 02:28:30,359
understood like trying to find Newman is
 

7807
02:28:30,359 --> 02:28:31,849
understood like trying to find Newman is
a historical case so you can like look

7808
02:28:31,849 --> 02:28:31,859
a historical case so you can like look
 

7809
02:28:31,859 --> 02:28:33,889
a historical case so you can like look
up what he did and imagine based on that

7810
02:28:33,889 --> 02:28:33,899
up what he did and imagine based on that
 

7811
02:28:33,899 --> 02:28:36,290
up what he did and imagine based on that
and we know like we people have like

7812
02:28:36,290 --> 02:28:36,300
and we know like we people have like
 

7813
02:28:36,300 --> 02:28:39,590
and we know like we people have like
some intuition for like if you have more

7814
02:28:39,590 --> 02:28:39,600
some intuition for like if you have more
 

7815
02:28:39,600 --> 02:28:41,929
some intuition for like if you have more
humans they can solve tougher cognitive

7816
02:28:41,929 --> 02:28:41,939
humans they can solve tougher cognitive
 

7817
02:28:41,939 --> 02:28:44,030
humans they can solve tougher cognitive
problems although in fact like in the

7818
02:28:44,030 --> 02:28:44,040
problems although in fact like in the
 

7819
02:28:44,040 --> 02:28:46,610
problems although in fact like in the
game of Kasparov versus the world which

7820
02:28:46,610 --> 02:28:46,620
game of Kasparov versus the world which
 

7821
02:28:46,620 --> 02:28:50,809
game of Kasparov versus the world which
was like Gary Kasparov on one side and

7822
02:28:50,809 --> 02:28:50,819
was like Gary Kasparov on one side and
 

7823
02:28:50,819 --> 02:28:52,969
was like Gary Kasparov on one side and
an entire horde of internet people led

7824
02:28:52,969 --> 02:28:52,979
an entire horde of internet people led
 

7825
02:28:52,979 --> 02:28:55,190
an entire horde of internet people led
by four chess Grand Masters on the other

7826
02:28:55,190 --> 02:28:55,200
by four chess Grand Masters on the other
 

7827
02:28:55,200 --> 02:28:58,730
by four chess Grand Masters on the other
side casparov one so like all those

7828
02:28:58,730 --> 02:28:58,740
side casparov one so like all those
 

7829
02:28:58,740 --> 02:29:02,030
side casparov one so like all those
people aggregated to be smarter it was a

7830
02:29:02,030 --> 02:29:02,040
people aggregated to be smarter it was a
 

7831
02:29:02,040 --> 02:29:03,830
people aggregated to be smarter it was a
it was a hard-fought game it's like all

7832
02:29:03,830 --> 02:29:03,840
it was a hard-fought game it's like all
 

7833
02:29:03,840 --> 02:29:05,330
it was a hard-fought game it's like all
those people aggregated to be smarter

7834
02:29:05,330 --> 02:29:05,340
those people aggregated to be smarter
 

7835
02:29:05,340 --> 02:29:07,309
those people aggregated to be smarter
than any individual one of them but not

7836
02:29:07,309 --> 02:29:07,319
than any individual one of them but not
 

7837
02:29:07,319 --> 02:29:09,170
than any individual one of them but not
they didn't aggregate so well that they

7838
02:29:09,170 --> 02:29:09,180
they didn't aggregate so well that they
 

7839
02:29:09,180 --> 02:29:11,870
they didn't aggregate so well that they
could defeat Kasparov but so like humans

7840
02:29:11,870 --> 02:29:11,880
could defeat Kasparov but so like humans
 

7841
02:29:11,880 --> 02:29:13,910
could defeat Kasparov but so like humans
aggregating don't actually get in my

7842
02:29:13,910 --> 02:29:13,920
aggregating don't actually get in my
 

7843
02:29:13,920 --> 02:29:16,070
aggregating don't actually get in my
opinion very much smarter especially

7844
02:29:16,070 --> 02:29:16,080
opinion very much smarter especially
 

7845
02:29:16,080 --> 02:29:18,170
opinion very much smarter especially
compared to running them for longer

7846
02:29:18,170 --> 02:29:18,180
compared to running them for longer
 

7847
02:29:18,180 --> 02:29:20,090
compared to running them for longer
like the the difference between

7848
02:29:20,090 --> 02:29:20,100
like the the difference between
 

7849
02:29:20,100 --> 02:29:22,490
like the the difference between
capabilities now and a thousand years

7850
02:29:22,490 --> 02:29:22,500
capabilities now and a thousand years
 

7851
02:29:22,500 --> 02:29:25,730
capabilities now and a thousand years
ago is a bigger Gap than the Gap in

7852
02:29:25,730 --> 02:29:25,740
ago is a bigger Gap than the Gap in
 

7853
02:29:25,740 --> 02:29:27,530
ago is a bigger Gap than the Gap in
capabilities between 10 people and one

7854
02:29:27,530 --> 02:29:27,540
capabilities between 10 people and one
 

7855

person
 

7857
02:29:29,280 --> 02:29:33,290
person
but like even so pumping intuition for

7858
02:29:33,290 --> 02:29:33,300
but like even so pumping intuition for
 

7859
02:29:33,300 --> 02:29:34,849
but like even so pumping intuition for
what it means to augment intelligence

7860
02:29:34,849 --> 02:29:34,859
what it means to augment intelligence
 

7861
02:29:34,859 --> 02:29:38,389
what it means to augment intelligence
John Von Neumann there's millions of him

7862
02:29:38,389 --> 02:29:38,399
John Von Neumann there's millions of him
 

7863
02:29:38,399 --> 02:29:42,830
John Von Neumann there's millions of him
he runs at a million times the speed and

7864
02:29:42,830 --> 02:29:42,840
he runs at a million times the speed and
 

7865
02:29:42,840 --> 02:29:44,389
he runs at a million times the speed and
therefore can solve tougher problems

7866
02:29:44,389 --> 02:29:44,399
therefore can solve tougher problems
 

7867
02:29:44,399 --> 02:29:48,290
therefore can solve tougher problems
quite a lot tougher

7868
02:29:48,290 --> 02:29:48,300

 

7869
02:29:48,300 --> 02:29:50,150

it's very hard to have an intuition

02:29:50,150 --> 02:29:50,160
it's very hard to have an intuition
 

7871
02:29:50,160 --> 02:29:52,210
it's very hard to have an intuition
about what that looks like especially

7872
02:29:52,210 --> 02:29:52,220
about what that looks like especially
 

7873
02:29:52,220 --> 02:29:55,610
about what that looks like especially
like you said

7874
02:29:55,610 --> 02:29:55,620
like you said
 

7875
02:29:55,620 --> 02:29:57,710
like you said
you know the intuition I kind of think

7876
02:29:57,710 --> 02:29:57,720
you know the intuition I kind of think
 

7877
02:29:57,720 --> 02:29:58,550
you know the intuition I kind of think
about

7878
02:29:58,550 --> 02:29:58,560
about
 

7879
02:29:58,560 --> 02:30:01,730
about
is uh it maintains the humanness

7880
02:30:01,730 --> 02:30:01,740
is uh it maintains the humanness
 

7881
02:30:01,740 --> 02:30:04,070
is uh it maintains the humanness
I think

7882
02:30:04,070 --> 02:30:04,080
I think
 

7883
02:30:04,080 --> 02:30:06,469
I think
I I think it's hard

7884
02:30:06,469 --> 02:30:06,479
I I think it's hard
 

7885
02:30:06,479 --> 02:30:08,870
I I think it's hard

well what happens is not that the
 

8009
02:32:28,080 --> 02:32:29,929
well what happens is not that the
individuals in the population evolve to

individuals in the population evolve to
 

8011
02:32:29,939 --> 02:32:31,370
individuals in the population evolve to
restrain their breeding but that they

restrain their breeding but that they
 

8013
02:32:31,380 --> 02:32:33,770

02:33:25,319 --> 02:33:27,469
hope it will produce and you have to
learn to clear that out of your mind and

02:33:27,469 --> 02:33:27,479
learn to clear that out of your mind and
 

8067
02:33:27,479 --> 02:33:29,450
learn to clear that out of your mind and
just think about the underlying Dynamics

8068
02:33:29,450 --> 02:33:29,460
just think about the underlying Dynamics

just think about the underlying Dynamics

02:34:22,380 --> 02:34:24,590
it would be by an AGI system well it's
kind of stupid it like has to like run

8116
02:34:24,590 --> 02:34:24,600
kind of stupid it like has to like run
 

8117
02:34:24,600 --> 02:34:27,110
kind of stupid it like has to like run
hundreds of generations to notice that

8118
02:34:27,110 --> 02:34:27,120
hundreds of generations to notice that
 

8119
02:34:27,120 --> 02:34:29,210
hundreds of generations to notice that
something is working it doesn't be like

8120
02:34:29,210 --> 02:34:29,220
something is working it doesn't be like
 

8121
02:34:29,220 --> 02:34:31,730
something is working it doesn't be like
oh well I tried this in like one

8122
02:34:31,730 --> 02:34:31,740
oh well I tried this in like one
 

8123
02:34:31,740 --> 02:34:33,830
oh well I tried this in like one
organism I saw it worked now I'm going

8124
02:34:33,830 --> 02:34:33,840
organism I saw it worked now I'm going
 

8125
02:34:33,840 --> 02:34:35,330
organism I saw it worked now I'm going
to like duplicate that feature onto

8126
02:34:35,330 --> 02:34:35,340
to like duplicate that feature onto
 

8127
02:34:35,340 --> 02:34:36,830
to like duplicate that feature onto
everything immediately

8128
02:34:36,830 --> 02:34:36,840
everything immediately
 

8129
02:34:36,840 --> 02:34:38,450
everything immediately
has to like run for hundreds of

8130
02:34:38,450 --> 02:34:38,460
has to like run for hundreds of
 

8131
02:34:38,460 --> 02:34:40,550
has to like run for hundreds of
generations for a new mutation to rise

8132
02:34:40,550 --> 02:34:40,560
generations for a new mutation to rise
 

8133
02:34:40,560 --> 02:34:42,530
generations for a new mutation to rise
to fixation I wonder if there's a case

8134
02:34:42,530 --> 02:34:42,540
to fixation I wonder if there's a case
 

8135
02:34:42,540 --> 02:34:45,349
to fixation I wonder if there's a case
to be made in natural selection

8136
02:34:45,349 --> 02:34:45,359
to be made in natural selection
 

8137
02:34:45,359 --> 02:34:48,050
to be made in natural selection
as inefficient as it looks is actually

8138
02:34:48,050 --> 02:34:48,060
as inefficient as it looks is actually
 

8139
02:34:48,060 --> 02:34:50,650
as inefficient as it looks is actually
uh

8140
02:34:50,650 --> 02:34:50,660
uh
 

8141
02:34:50,660 --> 02:34:54,349
uh
is actually quite powerful that that

8142
02:34:54,349 --> 02:34:54,359
is actually quite powerful that that
 

8143
02:34:54,359 --> 02:34:58,130
is actually quite powerful that that
this is extremely robust it runs for a

8144
02:34:58,130 --> 02:34:58,140
this is extremely robust it runs for a
 

8145
02:34:58,140 --> 02:35:00,110
this is extremely robust it runs for a
long time and eventually manages to

8146
02:35:00,110 --> 02:35:00,120
long time and eventually manages to
 

8147
02:35:00,120 --> 02:35:02,510
long time and eventually manages to
optimize things

8148
02:35:02,510 --> 02:35:02,520
optimize things
 

8149
02:35:02,520 --> 02:35:04,370
optimize things
it's weaker than gradient descent

8150
02:35:04,370 --> 02:35:04,380
it's weaker than gradient descent
 

8151
02:35:04,380 --> 02:35:06,230
it's weaker than gradient descent
because gradient descent also uses

8152
02:35:06,230 --> 02:35:06,240
because gradient descent also uses
 

8153
02:35:06,240 --> 02:35:08,290
because gradient descent also uses
information about the derivative

8154
02:35:08,290 --> 02:35:08,300
information about the derivative
 

8155
02:35:08,300 --> 02:35:11,809
information about the derivative
yeah Evolution seems to be there's not

8156
02:35:11,809 --> 02:35:11,819
yeah Evolution seems to be there's not
 

8157
02:35:11,819 --> 02:35:13,550
yeah Evolution seems to be there's not
really an objective function there's a

8158
02:35:13,550 --> 02:35:13,560
really an objective function there's a
 

8159
02:35:13,560 --> 02:35:16,309
really an objective function there's a
there's inclusive genic Fitness

8160
02:35:16,309 --> 02:35:16,319
there's inclusive genic Fitness
 

8161
02:35:16,319 --> 02:35:17,990
there's inclusive genic Fitness
is the implicit loss function of

8162
02:35:17,990 --> 02:35:18,000
is the implicit loss function of
 

8163
02:35:18,000 --> 02:35:20,510
is the implicit loss function of
evolution cannot change the loss

8164
02:35:20,510 --> 02:35:20,520
evolution cannot change the loss
 

8165
02:35:20,520 --> 02:35:22,550
evolution cannot change the loss
function doesn't change the environment

8166
02:35:22,550 --> 02:35:22,560
function doesn't change the environment
 

8167
02:35:22,560 --> 02:35:25,010
function doesn't change the environment
changes and therefore like what gets

8168
02:35:25,010 --> 02:35:25,020
changes and therefore like what gets
 

8169
02:35:25,020 --> 02:35:27,290
changes and therefore like what gets
optimized for in the organism changes

8170
02:35:27,290 --> 02:35:27,300
optimized for in the organism changes
 

8171
02:35:27,300 --> 02:35:29,990
optimized for in the organism changes
it's like take like gpt3 there's like

8172
02:35:29,990 --> 02:35:30,000
it's like take like gpt3 there's like
 

8173
02:35:30,000 --> 02:35:32,450
it's like take like gpt3 there's like
imagine like different versions of gpt3

8174
02:35:32,450 --> 02:35:32,460
imagine like different versions of gpt3
 

8175
02:35:32,460 --> 02:35:34,250
imagine like different versions of gpt3
where they're all trying to predict the

8176
02:35:34,250 --> 02:35:34,260
where they're all trying to predict the
 

8177
02:35:34,260 --> 02:35:35,929
where they're all trying to predict the
next word but they're being run on

8178
02:35:35,929 --> 02:35:35,939
next word but they're being run on
 

8179
02:35:35,939 --> 02:35:37,790
next word but they're being run on
different data sets of text

8180
02:35:37,790 --> 02:35:37,800
different data sets of text
 

8181
02:35:37,800 --> 02:35:40,070
different data sets of text
and that's like natural selection

8182
02:35:40,070 --> 02:35:40,080
and that's like natural selection
 

8183
02:35:40,080 --> 02:35:42,349
and that's like natural selection
always inclusogenic Fitness but like

8184
02:35:42,349 --> 02:35:42,359
always inclusogenic Fitness but like
 

8185
02:35:42,359 --> 02:35:47,570
always inclusogenic Fitness but like
different environmental problems

8186
02:35:47,570 --> 02:35:47,580

 

8187
02:35:47,580 --> 02:35:49,670

so it's it's uh it's difficult to think

8188
02:35:49,670 --> 02:35:49,680
so it's it's uh it's difficult to think
 

8189
02:35:49,680 --> 02:35:52,130
so it's it's uh it's difficult to think
about so if we're saying that natural

8190
02:35:52,130 --> 02:35:52,140
about so if we're saying that natural
 

8191
02:35:52,140 --> 02:35:54,590
about so if we're saying that natural
selection is stupid if we're saying that

8192
02:35:54,590 --> 02:35:54,600
selection is stupid if we're saying that
 

8193
02:35:54,600 --> 02:35:56,750
selection is stupid if we're saying that
humans are stupid

8194
02:35:56,750 --> 02:35:56,760
humans are stupid
 

8195
02:35:56,760 --> 02:35:58,490
humans are stupid
it's smarter than natural selection

8196
02:35:58,490 --> 02:35:58,500
it's smarter than natural selection
 

8197
02:35:58,500 --> 02:36:02,630
it's smarter than natural selection
smarter stupider than the upper bound

8198
02:36:02,630 --> 02:36:02,640

 

8199
02:36:02,640 --> 02:36:04,130

do you think there's an upper Bomb by

8200
02:36:04,130 --> 02:36:04,140
do you think there's an upper Bomb by
 

8201
02:36:04,140 --> 02:36:05,870
do you think there's an upper Bomb by
the way that's another meaningful place

8202
02:36:05,870 --> 02:36:05,880
the way that's another meaningful place
 

8203
02:36:05,880 --> 02:36:08,570
the way that's another meaningful place
I mean if you you put enough matter

8204
02:36:08,570 --> 02:36:08,580
I mean if you you put enough matter
 

8205
02:36:08,580 --> 02:36:10,849
I mean if you you put enough matter
energy compute into one place it will

8206
02:36:10,849 --> 02:36:10,859
energy compute into one place it will
 

8207
02:36:10,859 --> 02:36:13,070
energy compute into one place it will
collapse into a black hole and there's

8208
02:36:13,070 --> 02:36:13,080
collapse into a black hole and there's
 

8209
02:36:13,080 --> 02:36:15,349
collapse into a black hole and there's
only so much computation can do before

8210
02:36:15,349 --> 02:36:15,359
only so much computation can do before
 

8211
02:36:15,359 --> 02:36:17,030
only so much computation can do before
you run out of nagentropy in the

8212
02:36:17,030 --> 02:36:17,040
you run out of nagentropy in the
 

8213
02:36:17,040 --> 02:36:19,190
you run out of nagentropy in the
universe dies

8214
02:36:19,190 --> 02:36:19,200
universe dies
 

8215
02:36:19,200 --> 02:36:20,990
universe dies
um so there's an upper bound but it's

8216
02:36:20,990 --> 02:36:21,000
um so there's an upper bound but it's
 

8217
02:36:21,000 --> 02:36:24,170
um so there's an upper bound but it's
very very very far up above here like a

8218
02:36:24,170 --> 02:36:24,180
very very very far up above here like a
 

8219
02:36:24,180 --> 02:36:27,110
very very very far up above here like a
supernova is only finitely hot it's not

8220
02:36:27,110 --> 02:36:27,120
supernova is only finitely hot it's not
 

8221
02:36:27,120 --> 02:36:29,090
supernova is only finitely hot it's not
infinitely hot but it's really really

8222
02:36:29,090 --> 02:36:29,100
infinitely hot but it's really really
 

8223
02:36:29,100 --> 02:36:31,690
infinitely hot but it's really really
really really hot

8224
02:36:31,690 --> 02:36:31,700
really really hot
 

8225
02:36:31,700 --> 02:36:34,070
really really hot
well let me ask you let me talk to you

8226
02:36:34,070 --> 02:36:34,080
well let me ask you let me talk to you
 

8227
02:36:34,080 --> 02:36:35,929
well let me ask you let me talk to you
about Consciousness

8228
02:36:35,929 --> 02:36:35,939
about Consciousness
 

8229
02:36:35,939 --> 02:36:37,750
about Consciousness
um also coupled with that question is

8230
02:36:37,750 --> 02:36:37,760
um also coupled with that question is
 

8231
02:36:37,760 --> 02:36:40,010
um also coupled with that question is
imagining a world with super intelligent

8232
02:36:40,010 --> 02:36:40,020
imagining a world with super intelligent
 

8233
02:36:40,020 --> 02:36:42,469
imagining a world with super intelligent
AI systems that get rid of humans but

8234
02:36:42,469 --> 02:36:42,479
AI systems that get rid of humans but
 

8235
02:36:42,479 --> 02:36:46,389
AI systems that get rid of humans but
nevertheless keep

8236
02:36:46,389 --> 02:36:46,399

 

8237
02:36:46,399 --> 02:36:49,250

some of the something that we would

8238
02:36:49,250 --> 02:36:49,260
some of the something that we would
 

8239
02:36:49,260 --> 02:36:52,910
some of the something that we would
consider beautiful and amazing why

8240
02:36:52,910 --> 02:36:52,920
consider beautiful and amazing why
 

8241
02:36:52,920 --> 02:36:54,830
consider beautiful and amazing why
the lesson of evolutionary biology don't

8242
02:36:54,830 --> 02:36:54,840
the lesson of evolutionary biology don't
 

8243
02:36:54,840 --> 02:36:56,990
the lesson of evolutionary biology don't
just like if you just guess what an

8244
02:36:56,990 --> 02:36:57,000
just like if you just guess what an
 

8245
02:36:57,000 --> 02:36:59,090
just like if you just guess what an
optimization does based on what you hope

8246
02:36:59,090 --> 02:36:59,100
optimization does based on what you hope
 

8247
02:36:59,100 --> 02:37:01,250
optimization does based on what you hope
the results will be it usually will not

8248
02:37:01,250 --> 02:37:01,260
the results will be it usually will not
 

8249
02:37:01,260 --> 02:37:02,929
the results will be it usually will not
do that is that hope I mean it's not

8250
02:37:02,929 --> 02:37:02,939
do that is that hope I mean it's not
 

8251
02:37:02,939 --> 02:37:05,030
do that is that hope I mean it's not
hope I don't I think if you cold and

8252
02:37:05,030 --> 02:37:05,040
hope I don't I think if you cold and
 

8253
02:37:05,040 --> 02:37:07,849
hope I don't I think if you cold and
objectively look at what makes what has

8254
02:37:07,849 --> 02:37:07,859
objectively look at what makes what has
 

8255
02:37:07,859 --> 02:37:11,929
objectively look at what makes what has
been a powerful a useful

8256
02:37:11,929 --> 02:37:11,939

 

8257
02:37:11,939 --> 02:37:14,690

I I think there's a correlation between

8258
02:37:14,690 --> 02:37:14,700
I I think there's a correlation between
 

8259
02:37:14,700 --> 02:37:17,150
I I think there's a correlation between
what we find beautiful and a thing

8260
02:37:17,150 --> 02:37:17,160
what we find beautiful and a thing
 

8261
02:37:17,160 --> 02:37:18,469
what we find beautiful and a thing
that's been useful

8262
02:37:18,469 --> 02:37:18,479
that's been useful
 

8263
02:37:18,479 --> 02:37:20,570
that's been useful
this is what the early biologists

8264
02:37:20,570 --> 02:37:20,580
this is what the early biologists
 

8265
02:37:20,580 --> 02:37:22,790
this is what the early biologists
thought they were like no no I'm not

8266
02:37:22,790 --> 02:37:22,800
thought they were like no no I'm not
 

8267
02:37:22,800 --> 02:37:25,309
thought they were like no no I'm not
just like they thought like no no I'm

8268
02:37:25,309 --> 02:37:25,319
just like they thought like no no I'm
 

8269
02:37:25,319 --> 02:37:27,410
just like they thought like no no I'm
not just like imagining stuff that would

8270
02:37:27,410 --> 02:37:27,420
not just like imagining stuff that would
 

8271
02:37:27,420 --> 02:37:29,870
not just like imagining stuff that would
be pretty it's useful for popular for

8272
02:37:29,870 --> 02:37:29,880
be pretty it's useful for popular for
 

8273
02:37:29,880 --> 02:37:31,309
be pretty it's useful for popular for
organisms to restrain their own

8274
02:37:31,309 --> 02:37:31,319
organisms to restrain their own
 

8275
02:37:31,319 --> 02:37:33,349
organisms to restrain their own
reproduction because then they don't

8276
02:37:33,349 --> 02:37:33,359
reproduction because then they don't
 

8277
02:37:33,359 --> 02:37:35,990
reproduction because then they don't
overrun the prey populations and they

8278
02:37:35,990 --> 02:37:36,000
overrun the prey populations and they
 

8279
02:37:36,000 --> 02:37:37,550
overrun the prey populations and they
actually have more kids in the long run

8280
02:37:37,550 --> 02:37:37,560
actually have more kids in the long run
 

8281
02:37:37,560 --> 02:37:39,230
actually have more kids in the long run
hmm

8282
02:37:39,230 --> 02:37:39,240
hmm
 

8283
02:37:39,240 --> 02:37:41,510
hmm
so so let me just ask you about

8284
02:37:41,510 --> 02:37:41,520
so so let me just ask you about
 

8285
02:37:41,520 --> 02:37:44,210
so so let me just ask you about
Consciousness do you think Consciousness

8286
02:37:44,210 --> 02:37:44,220
Consciousness do you think Consciousness
 

8287
02:37:44,220 --> 02:37:48,590
Consciousness do you think Consciousness
is useful to humans no two AGI systems

8288
02:37:48,590 --> 02:37:48,600
is useful to humans no two AGI systems
 

8289
02:37:48,600 --> 02:37:51,530
is useful to humans no two AGI systems
to well

8290
02:37:51,530 --> 02:37:51,540
to well
 

8291
02:37:51,540 --> 02:37:53,150
to well
um in this transitionary pay between

8292
02:37:53,150 --> 02:37:53,160
um in this transitionary pay between
 

8293
02:37:53,160 --> 02:37:55,429
um in this transitionary pay between
humans and AGI to AGI systems as they

8294
02:37:55,429 --> 02:37:55,439
humans and AGI to AGI systems as they
 

8295
02:37:55,439 --> 02:37:57,469
humans and AGI to AGI systems as they
become smarter and smarter is there some

8296
02:37:57,469 --> 02:37:57,479
become smarter and smarter is there some
 

8297
02:37:57,479 --> 02:37:59,450
become smarter and smarter is there some
use to it what

8298
02:37:59,450 --> 02:37:59,460
use to it what
 

8299
02:37:59,460 --> 02:38:03,670
use to it what
let me step back what is consciousness

8300
02:38:03,670 --> 02:38:03,680
let me step back what is consciousness
 

8301
02:38:03,680 --> 02:38:06,530
let me step back what is consciousness
eleazaridkowski what is consciousness

8302
02:38:06,530 --> 02:38:06,540
eleazaridkowski what is consciousness
 

8303
02:38:06,540 --> 02:38:09,770
eleazaridkowski what is consciousness
I'm referring to chalmers's hard problem

8304
02:38:09,770 --> 02:38:09,780
I'm referring to chalmers's hard problem
 

8305
02:38:09,780 --> 02:38:12,290
I'm referring to chalmers's hard problem
of conscious experience are you

8306
02:38:12,290 --> 02:38:12,300
of conscious experience are you
 

8307
02:38:12,300 --> 02:38:14,510
of conscious experience are you
referring it to self-awareness and

8308
02:38:14,510 --> 02:38:14,520
referring it to self-awareness and
 

8309
02:38:14,520 --> 02:38:16,790
referring it to self-awareness and
reflection are referring to the state of

8310

this is how I know you're an advanced
language model I did give you a simple

8316
02:38:23,570 --> 02:38:23,580
language model I did give you a simple
 

8317
02:38:23,580 --> 02:38:24,950
language model I did give you a simple
prompt and you gave me a bunch of

8318
02:38:24,950 --> 02:38:24,960
prompt and you gave me a bunch of
 

8319
02:38:24,960 --> 02:38:29,990
prompt and you gave me a bunch of
options uh

importance
 

8331
02:38:40,500 --> 02:38:42,650
importance
to what you've just been talking about

to what you've just been talking about
 

8333
02:38:42,660 --> 02:38:44,270
to what you've just been talking about
which is intelligence

8334
02:38:44,270 --> 02:38:44,280
which is intelligence
 

8335
02:38:44,280 --> 02:38:48,889
which is intelligence
is it a foundation to intelligence is it

8336
02:38:48,889 --> 02:38:48,899
is it a foundation to intelligence is it
 

8337
02:38:48,899 --> 02:38:51,410
is it a foundation to intelligence is it
intricately connected to intelligence in

8338
02:38:51,410 --> 02:38:51,420
intricately connected to intelligence in
 

8339
02:38:51,420 --> 02:38:54,230
intricately connected to intelligence in
the human mind or is it is it a side

8340
02:38:54,230 --> 02:38:54,240
the human mind or is it is it a side
 

8341
02:38:54,240 --> 02:38:58,250
the human mind or is it is it a side
effect of the human mind it is a useful

8342
02:38:58,250 --> 02:38:58,260
effect of the human mind it is a useful
 

8343
02:38:58,260 --> 02:39:01,070
effect of the human mind it is a useful
little tool like we can get rid of I

8344
02:39:01,070 --> 02:39:01,080
little tool like we can get rid of I
 

8345
02:39:01,080 --> 02:39:02,809
little tool like we can get rid of I
guess I'm trying to get

8346
02:39:02,809 --> 02:39:02,819
guess I'm trying to get
 

8347
02:39:02,819 --> 02:39:05,389
guess I'm trying to get
some color in your opinion

8348
02:39:05,389 --> 02:39:05,399
some color in your opinion
 

8349
02:39:05,399 --> 02:39:08,030
some color in your opinion
of how useful it is in the uh

8350
02:39:08,030 --> 02:39:08,040
of how useful it is in the uh
 

8351
02:39:08,040 --> 02:39:09,770
of how useful it is in the uh
intelligence of a human being and then

8352
02:39:09,770 --> 02:39:09,780
intelligence of a human being and then
 

8353
02:39:09,780 --> 02:39:12,410
intelligence of a human being and then
try to generalize that to AI whether AI

8354
02:39:12,410 --> 02:39:12,420
try to generalize that to AI whether AI
 

8355
02:39:12,420 --> 02:39:15,950
try to generalize that to AI whether AI
will keep some of that

8356
02:39:15,950 --> 02:39:15,960

 

8357
02:39:15,960 --> 02:39:19,610

so I think that for there to be like a

8358
02:39:19,610 --> 02:39:19,620
so I think that for there to be like a
 

8359
02:39:19,620 --> 02:39:21,590
so I think that for there to be like a
person who I care about looking out at

8360
02:39:21,590 --> 02:39:21,600
person who I care about looking out at
 

8361
02:39:21,600 --> 02:39:23,389
person who I care about looking out at
the universe and wondering at it and

8362
02:39:23,389 --> 02:39:23,399
the universe and wondering at it and
 

8363
02:39:23,399 --> 02:39:24,950
the universe and wondering at it and
appreciating it

8364
02:39:24,950 --> 02:39:24,960
appreciating it
 

8365
02:39:24,960 --> 02:39:28,550
appreciating it
it's not enough to have a model of

8366
02:39:28,550 --> 02:39:28,560
it's not enough to have a model of
 

8367
02:39:28,560 --> 02:39:30,950
it's not enough to have a model of
yourself

8368
02:39:30,950 --> 02:39:30,960

 

8369
02:39:30,960 --> 02:39:34,010

I think that it is useful to an

8370
02:39:34,010 --> 02:39:34,020
I think that it is useful to an
 

8371
02:39:34,020 --> 02:39:35,690
I think that it is useful to an
intelligent mind to have a model of

8372
02:39:35,690 --> 02:39:35,700
intelligent mind to have a model of
 

8373
02:39:35,700 --> 02:39:37,370
intelligent mind to have a model of
itself but

8374
02:39:37,370 --> 02:39:37,380
itself but
 

8375
02:39:37,380 --> 02:39:41,270
itself but
I think you can have that without

8376
02:39:41,270 --> 02:39:41,280

 

8377
02:39:41,280 --> 02:39:42,889

pleasure

8378
02:39:42,889 --> 02:39:42,899
pleasure
 

8379
02:39:42,899 --> 02:39:45,050
pleasure
pain

8380
02:39:45,050 --> 02:39:45,060
pain
 

8381

pain
Aesthetics

8382
02:39:48,110 --> 02:39:48,120

 

8383

8385
02:39:52,140 --> 02:39:54,710

a sense of wonder

8386
02:39:54,710 --> 02:39:54,720
a sense of wonder
 

8387
02:39:54,720 --> 02:39:56,570
a sense of wonder
um

8388
02:39:56,570 --> 02:39:56,580
um
 

8389
02:39:56,580 --> 02:39:59,929
um
like I think you can have a model of

8390
02:39:59,929 --> 02:39:59,939
like I think you can have a model of
 

8391
02:39:59,939 --> 02:40:02,389
like I think you can have a model of
like how much memory you're using and

8392
02:40:02,389 --> 02:40:02,399
like how much memory you're using and
 

8393
02:40:02,399 --> 02:40:03,469
like how much memory you're using and
whether

8394
02:40:03,469 --> 02:40:03,479
whether
 

8395
02:40:03,479 --> 02:40:04,730
whether
like

8396
02:40:04,730 --> 02:40:04,740
like
 

8397
02:40:04,740 --> 02:40:07,370
like
this thought or that thought is is like

8398
02:40:07,370 --> 02:40:07,380
this thought or that thought is is like
 

8399
02:40:07,380 --> 02:40:08,870
this thought or that thought is is like
more likely to lead to a winning

8400
02:40:08,870 --> 02:40:08,880
more likely to lead to a winning
 

8401
02:40:08,880 --> 02:40:13,790
more likely to lead to a winning
position and you can have like the use I

8402
02:40:13,790 --> 02:40:13,800
position and you can have like the use I
 

8403
02:40:13,800 --> 02:40:16,490
position and you can have like the use I
think that if you optimize really hard

8404
02:40:16,490 --> 02:40:16,500
think that if you optimize really hard
 

8405
02:40:16,500 --> 02:40:19,910
think that if you optimize really hard
on efficiently just having the useful

8406
02:40:19,910 --> 02:40:19,920
on efficiently just having the useful
 

8407
02:40:19,920 --> 02:40:20,929
on efficiently just having the useful
parts

8408
02:40:20,929 --> 02:40:20,939
parts
 

8409
02:40:20,939 --> 02:40:23,570
parts
there is not then the think that the

8410
02:40:23,570 --> 02:40:23,580
there is not then the think that the
 

8411
02:40:23,580 --> 02:40:26,570
there is not then the think that the
thing that says like I am here I look

8412
02:40:26,570 --> 02:40:26,580
thing that says like I am here I look
 

8413
02:40:26,580 --> 02:40:28,610
thing that says like I am here I look
out I wonder

8414
02:40:28,610 --> 02:40:28,620
out I wonder
 

8415
02:40:28,620 --> 02:40:31,070
out I wonder
I feel happy in this I feel sad about

8416
02:40:31,070 --> 02:40:31,080
I feel happy in this I feel sad about
 

8417
02:40:31,080 --> 02:40:33,590
I feel happy in this I feel sad about
that

8418
02:40:33,590 --> 02:40:33,600

 

8419
02:40:33,600 --> 02:40:35,570

I think there's a thing that knows what

8420
02:40:35,570 --> 02:40:35,580
I think there's a thing that knows what
 

8421
02:40:35,580 --> 02:40:38,270
I think there's a thing that knows what
it is thinking but that doesn't quite

8422
02:40:38,270 --> 02:40:38,280
it is thinking but that doesn't quite
 

8423
02:40:38,280 --> 02:40:39,410
it is thinking but that doesn't quite
care

8424
02:40:39,410 --> 02:40:39,420
care
 

8425
02:40:39,420 --> 02:40:40,790
care
about

8426
02:40:40,790 --> 02:40:40,800
about
 

8427
02:40:40,800 --> 02:40:43,070
about
these are my thoughts this is my me and

8428
02:40:43,070 --> 02:40:43,080
these are my thoughts this is my me and
 

8429
02:40:43,080 --> 02:40:45,670
these are my thoughts this is my me and
that matters

8430
02:40:45,670 --> 02:40:45,680
that matters
 

8431
02:40:45,680 --> 02:40:49,190
that matters
does that make you sad if that's lost in

8432
02:40:49,190 --> 02:40:49,200
does that make you sad if that's lost in
 

8433
02:40:49,200 --> 02:40:51,650
does that make you sad if that's lost in
egi I think that if that's lost then

8434
02:40:51,650 --> 02:40:51,660
egi I think that if that's lost then
 

8435
02:40:51,660 --> 02:40:53,570
egi I think that if that's lost then
every then basically everything that

8436
02:40:53,570 --> 02:40:53,580
every then basically everything that
 

8437
02:40:53,580 --> 02:40:58,309
every then basically everything that
matters is lost

8438
02:40:58,309 --> 02:40:58,319

 

8439
02:40:58,319 --> 02:41:01,849

I think that when you optimize that when

8440
02:41:01,849 --> 02:41:01,859
I think that when you optimize that when
 

8441
02:41:01,859 --> 02:41:05,090
I think that when you optimize that when
you go really hard on making tiny

8442
02:41:05,090 --> 02:41:05,100
you go really hard on making tiny
 

8443
02:41:05,100 --> 02:41:08,030
you go really hard on making tiny
molecular spirals or paper clips

8444

molecular spirals or paper clips
 

8445
02:41:08,040 --> 02:41:11,210
molecular spirals or paper clips
that when you like grind much harder

8446
02:41:11,210 --> 02:41:11,220
that when you like grind much harder
 

8447
02:41:11,220 --> 02:41:13,370
that when you like grind much harder
than on that then natural selection

8448
02:41:13,370 --> 02:41:13,380
than on that then natural selection
 

8449
02:41:13,380 --> 02:41:15,889
than on that then natural selection
round out to make humans

8450
02:41:15,889 --> 02:41:15,899
round out to make humans
 

8451
02:41:15,899 --> 02:41:17,450

that
 

8453
02:41:17,460 --> 02:41:21,650
that
there isn't then the mess

8454
02:41:21,650 --> 02:41:21,660
there isn't then the mess
 

8455
02:41:21,660 --> 02:41:24,889
there isn't then the mess

you know in humans there's like this

02:41:36,950 --> 02:41:36,960
you know in humans there's like this
 

8467
02:41:36,960 --> 02:41:39,590
you know in humans there's like this
difference between like the desire of

having it
 

8473
02:41:42,240 --> 02:41:45,770
having it
and it's all these like evolutionary

and it's all these like evolutionary
 

8475
02:41:45,780 --> 02:41:47,809

02:41:56,990 --> 02:41:57,000
and the thing that I worry about is that
 

8483
02:41:57,000 --> 02:42:00,530
and the thing that I worry about is that
this is not the the thing that happens

this is not the the thing that happens
 

8485
02:42:00,540 --> 02:42:02,990
this is not the the thing that happens
again just the way that happens in us or

02:42:02,990 --> 02:42:03,000
again just the way that happens in us or
 

8487
02:42:03,000 --> 02:42:04,490
again just the way that happens in us or
even like quite similar enough that

02:42:04,490 --> 02:42:04,500
even like quite similar enough that
 

8489
02:42:04,500 --> 02:42:06,110
even like quite similar enough that
there's that there are like many basins

8490
02:42:06,110 --> 02:42:06,120
there's that there are like many basins
 

8491
02:42:06,120 --> 02:42:08,150
there's that there are like many basins
of attractions here and we are in the

space of an attra of Attraction like
 

8495
02:42:10,560 --> 02:42:12,530

end up in and the AIS do not end up in
this one when they go like way harder on

this one when they go like way harder on
 

8505
02:42:22,520 --> 02:42:24,349
this one when they go like way harder on

I don't I think the human alignment
 

8541
02:43:03,840 --> 02:43:06,050
I don't I think the human alignment
problem is a terrible phrase because it

8542
02:43:06,050 --> 02:43:06,060
problem is a terrible phrase because it
 

8543
02:43:06,060 --> 02:43:08,090
problem is a terrible phrase because it
is very very different to like try to

is very very different to like try to
 

8545
02:43:08,100 --> 02:43:10,250
is very very different to like try to
build systems out of humans some of whom

8546
02:43:10,250 --> 02:43:10,260
build systems out of humans some of whom
 

8547
02:43:10,260 --> 02:43:11,750
build systems out of humans some of whom
are nice and some of whom are not nice

are nice and some of whom are not nice
 

8549
02:43:11,760 --> 02:43:13,190
are nice and some of whom are not nice

and some of whom are trying to trick you
 

8551
02:43:13,200 --> 02:43:15,230
and some of whom are trying to trick you
and like build a social system out of

8552
02:43:15,230 --> 02:43:15,240
and like build a social system out of
 

8553
02:43:15,240 --> 02:43:17,270
and like build a social system out of

like large populations of those who are

like all it basically the same level of

IQ that but like

IQ that but like
 

8561
02:43:22,380 --> 02:43:24,550
IQ that but like

that versus chimpanzees
 

8563
02:43:24,560 --> 02:43:26,990
that versus chimpanzees
like it is very different to try to

02:43:26,990 --> 02:43:27,000
like it is very different to try to
 

8565
02:43:27,000 --> 02:43:29,210
like it is very different to try to
solve that problem than to try to build

8566
02:43:29,210 --> 02:43:29,220
solve that problem than to try to build
 

8567
02:43:29,220 --> 02:43:31,370
solve that problem than to try to build

they're just very different problems and

02:43:35,819 --> 02:43:37,070
they're just very different problems and
I think that all the analogies between

I think that all the analogies between
 

8577
02:43:37,080 --> 02:43:39,910
I think that all the analogies between
them are horribly misleading and I yeah

them are horribly misleading and I yeah

02:43:39,920 --> 02:43:42,590
them are horribly misleading and I yeah

02:44:01,560 --> 02:44:04,429
on your first try I think on your first
try you are like trying to build an

8598
02:44:04,429 --> 02:44:04,439
try you are like trying to build an
 

8599
02:44:04,439 --> 02:44:07,309
try you are like trying to build an
you know okay like

8600
02:44:07,309 --> 02:44:07,319
you know okay like
 

8601
02:44:07,319 --> 02:44:09,170
you know okay like
probably not what you should actually do

8602
02:44:09,170 --> 02:44:09,180
probably not what you should actually do
 

8603
02:44:09,180 --> 02:44:11,150
probably not what you should actually do
but like let's say you were trying to

8604
02:44:11,150 --> 02:44:11,160
but like let's say you were trying to
 

8605
02:44:11,160 --> 02:44:13,370
but like let's say you were trying to
build something that is like Alpha fold

8606
02:44:13,370 --> 02:44:13,380
build something that is like Alpha fold
 

8607
02:44:13,380 --> 02:44:17,450
build something that is like Alpha fold
17 and you are trying to get it to solve

8608
02:44:17,450 --> 02:44:17,460
17 and you are trying to get it to solve
 

8609
02:44:17,460 --> 02:44:19,190
17 and you are trying to get it to solve
the biology problems associated with

8610
02:44:19,190 --> 02:44:19,200
the biology problems associated with
 

8611
02:44:19,200 --> 02:44:21,889
the biology problems associated with
making humans smarter so that demons can

8612
02:44:21,889 --> 02:44:21,899
making humans smarter so that demons can
 

8613
02:44:21,899 --> 02:44:24,410
making humans smarter so that demons can
like actually solve alignment

8614
02:44:24,410 --> 02:44:24,420
like actually solve alignment
 

8615
02:44:24,420 --> 02:44:26,750
like actually solve alignment
so you've got like a super biologist and

8616
02:44:26,750 --> 02:44:26,760
so you've got like a super biologist and
 

8617
02:44:26,760 --> 02:44:28,130
so you've got like a super biologist and
you would like it to and I think what

8618
02:44:28,130 --> 02:44:28,140
you would like it to and I think what
 

8619
02:44:28,140 --> 02:44:29,450
you would like it to and I think what
you would want in the situation is for

8620
02:44:29,450 --> 02:44:29,460
you would want in the situation is for
 

8621
02:44:29,460 --> 02:44:30,530
you would want in the situation is for
to like

8622
02:44:30,530 --> 02:44:30,540
to like
 

8623
02:44:30,540 --> 02:44:33,110
to like
just be thinking about biology and not

8624
02:44:33,110 --> 02:44:33,120
just be thinking about biology and not
 

8625
02:44:33,120 --> 02:44:35,090
just be thinking about biology and not
thinking about a very wide range of

8626
02:44:35,090 --> 02:44:35,100
thinking about a very wide range of
 

8627
02:44:35,100 --> 02:44:36,110
thinking about a very wide range of
things that includes how to kill

8628
02:44:36,110 --> 02:44:36,120
things that includes how to kill
 

8629
02:44:36,120 --> 02:44:37,910
things that includes how to kill
everybody

8630
02:44:37,910 --> 02:44:37,920
everybody
 

8631
02:44:37,920 --> 02:44:39,889
everybody
and I think that that you're that the

8632
02:44:39,889 --> 02:44:39,899
and I think that that you're that the
 

8633
02:44:39,899 --> 02:44:42,710
and I think that that you're that the
first AIS you're trying to build not a

8634
02:44:42,710 --> 02:44:42,720
first AIS you're trying to build not a
 

8635
02:44:42,720 --> 02:44:45,650
first AIS you're trying to build not a
million years later the first ones

8636
02:44:45,650 --> 02:44:45,660
million years later the first ones
 

8637
02:44:45,660 --> 02:44:48,290
million years later the first ones
look more like narrowly specialized

8638
02:44:48,290 --> 02:44:48,300
look more like narrowly specialized
 

8639
02:44:48,300 --> 02:44:52,429
look more like narrowly specialized
biologists than like

8640
02:44:52,429 --> 02:44:52,439
biologists than like
 

8641
02:44:52,439 --> 02:44:54,590
biologists than like
getting the full complexity and wonder

8642
02:44:54,590 --> 02:44:54,600
getting the full complexity and wonder
 

8643
02:44:54,600 --> 02:44:56,870
getting the full complexity and wonder
of human experience in there in such a

8644
02:44:56,870 --> 02:44:56,880
of human experience in there in such a
 

8645
02:44:56,880 --> 02:44:58,309
of human experience in there in such a
way that it wants to preserve itself

8646
02:44:58,309 --> 02:44:58,319
way that it wants to preserve itself
 

8647
02:44:58,319 --> 02:45:00,770
way that it wants to preserve itself
even as it becomes much smarter which is

8648
02:45:00,770 --> 02:45:00,780
even as it becomes much smarter which is
 

8649
02:45:00,780 --> 02:45:02,330
even as it becomes much smarter which is
a drastic system change is going to have

8650
02:45:02,330 --> 02:45:02,340
a drastic system change is going to have
 

8651
02:45:02,340 --> 02:45:03,830
a drastic system change is going to have
all kinds of side effects that you know

8652
02:45:03,830 --> 02:45:03,840
all kinds of side effects that you know
 

8653
02:45:03,840 --> 02:45:05,090
all kinds of side effects that you know
like if we're dealing with Chinese

8654
02:45:05,090 --> 02:45:05,100
like if we're dealing with Chinese
 

8655
02:45:05,100 --> 02:45:06,830
like if we're dealing with Chinese
scrutable matrices we're not very likely

8656
02:45:06,830 --> 02:45:06,840
scrutable matrices we're not very likely
 

8657
02:45:06,840 --> 02:45:08,809
scrutable matrices we're not very likely
to be able to see coming in advance so

8658
02:45:08,809 --> 02:45:08,819
to be able to see coming in advance so
 

8659
02:45:08,819 --> 02:45:10,610
to be able to see coming in advance so
but I don't think it's just the matrices

8660
02:45:10,610 --> 02:45:10,620
but I don't think it's just the matrices
 

8661
02:45:10,620 --> 02:45:12,889
but I don't think it's just the matrices
is we're also dealing with the data

8662
02:45:12,889 --> 02:45:12,899
is we're also dealing with the data
 

8663
02:45:12,899 --> 02:45:15,590
is we're also dealing with the data
right with the with the uh with the data

8664
02:45:15,590 --> 02:45:15,600
right with the with the uh with the data
 

8665
02:45:15,600 --> 02:45:17,990
right with the with the uh with the data
on the on the internet and then this is

8666
02:45:17,990 --> 02:45:18,000
on the on the internet and then this is
 

8667
02:45:18,000 --> 02:45:19,309
on the on the internet and then this is
an interesting discussion about the data

8668
02:45:19,309 --> 02:45:19,319
an interesting discussion about the data
 

8669
02:45:19,319 --> 02:45:21,110
an interesting discussion about the data
set itself but the data set includes the

8670
02:45:21,110 --> 02:45:21,120
set itself but the data set includes the
 

8671
02:45:21,120 --> 02:45:23,450
set itself but the data set includes the
full complexity of human nature no it's

8672
02:45:23,450 --> 02:45:23,460
full complexity of human nature no it's
 

8673
02:45:23,460 --> 02:45:26,450
full complexity of human nature no it's
a it's a it's a shadow cast by yes by

02:45:26,450 --> 02:45:26,460
a it's a it's a shadow cast by yes by
 

8675
02:45:26,460 --> 02:45:27,950
a it's a it's a shadow cast by yes by
humans on the internet but don't you

8676
02:45:27,950 --> 02:45:27,960
humans on the internet but don't you
 

8677
02:45:27,960 --> 02:45:29,830
humans on the internet but don't you
think that shadow

8678
02:45:29,830 --> 02:45:29,840
think that shadow
 

8679
02:45:29,840 --> 02:45:34,490
think that shadow
uh is a youngin Shadow I think that if

8680
02:45:34,490 --> 02:45:34,500
uh is a youngin Shadow I think that if
 

8681
02:45:34,500 --> 02:45:35,510
uh is a youngin Shadow I think that if
you had

8682
02:45:35,510 --> 02:45:35,520
you had
 

8683
02:45:35,520 --> 02:45:38,030
you had
alien super intelligences looking at the

8684
02:45:38,030 --> 02:45:38,040
alien super intelligences looking at the
 

8685
02:45:38,040 --> 02:45:39,650
alien super intelligences looking at the
data they would be able to pick up from

8686
02:45:39,650 --> 02:45:39,660
data they would be able to pick up from
 

8687
02:45:39,660 --> 02:45:41,929
data they would be able to pick up from
it an excellent picture of what humans

how to

alienness
 

8739
02:46:42,660 --> 02:46:44,690
alienness
and the aliens would look at my outputs

02:46:44,690 --> 02:46:44,700
and the aliens would look at my outputs
 

8741
02:46:44,700 --> 02:46:48,530
and the aliens would look at my outputs
and say like is there not a deep

and say like is there not a deep
 

8743
02:46:48,540 --> 02:46:51,290
and say like is there not a deep
then like name of alien nature to this

then like name of alien nature to this
 

8745
02:46:51,300 --> 02:46:52,130
then like name of alien nature to this
thing

thing
and what they would be seeing was that I

and what they would be seeing was that I
 

8749
02:46:54,240 --> 02:46:57,349
and what they would be seeing was that I
had correctly understood them but not

02:46:57,349 --> 02:46:57,359
had correctly understood them but not

8753
02:47:04,920 --> 02:47:07,190

we've used aliens as a metaphor as a

02:50:09,600 --> 02:50:10,790
might reach out there towards the stars
and find

8916
02:50:10,790 --> 02:50:10,800
and find
 

8917
02:50:10,800 --> 02:50:13,429
and find
no if they if if the nice aliens were

8918
02:50:13,429 --> 02:50:13,439
no if they if if the nice aliens were
 

8919
02:50:13,439 --> 02:50:15,830
no if they if if the nice aliens were
already here they would like have

8920
02:50:15,830 --> 02:50:15,840
already here they would like have
 

8921
02:50:15,840 --> 02:50:17,450
already here they would like have
stopped the Holocaust you know that's

8922
02:50:17,450 --> 02:50:17,460
stopped the Holocaust you know that's
 

8923
02:50:17,460 --> 02:50:19,309
stopped the Holocaust you know that's
like that's a valid argument against the

8924
02:50:19,309 --> 02:50:19,319
like that's a valid argument against the
 

8925
02:50:19,319 --> 02:50:20,870
like that's a valid argument against the
existence of God it's also a valid

8926
02:50:20,870 --> 02:50:20,880
existence of God it's also a valid
 

8927
02:50:20,880 --> 02:50:22,730
existence of God it's also a valid
argument against the existence of nice

8928
02:50:22,730 --> 02:50:22,740
argument against the existence of nice
 

8929
02:50:22,740 --> 02:50:25,370
argument against the existence of nice
aliens and un nice aliens would have

8930
02:50:25,370 --> 02:50:25,380
aliens and un nice aliens would have
 

8931
02:50:25,380 --> 02:50:26,750
aliens and un nice aliens would have
just eaten the planet

8932
02:50:26,750 --> 02:50:26,760
just eaten the planet
 

8933
02:50:26,760 --> 02:50:29,830
just eaten the planet
so no aliens

8934
02:50:29,830 --> 02:50:29,840
so no aliens
 

8935
02:50:29,840 --> 02:50:32,450
so no aliens
you've had debates with Robin Hansen

8936
02:50:32,450 --> 02:50:32,460
you've had debates with Robin Hansen
 

8937
02:50:32,460 --> 02:50:34,250
you've had debates with Robin Hansen
that you mentioned uh so the one

8938
02:50:34,250 --> 02:50:34,260
that you mentioned uh so the one
 

8939
02:50:34,260 --> 02:50:36,349
that you mentioned uh so the one
particular I just want to mention is the

8940
02:50:36,349 --> 02:50:36,359
particular I just want to mention is the
 

8941
02:50:36,359 --> 02:50:39,650
particular I just want to mention is the
idea of AI foom or the ability of AGI to

8942
02:50:39,650 --> 02:50:39,660
idea of AI foom or the ability of AGI to
 

8943
02:50:39,660 --> 02:50:41,630
idea of AI foom or the ability of AGI to
improve themselves very quickly uh

8944
02:50:41,630 --> 02:50:41,640
improve themselves very quickly uh
 

8945
02:50:41,640 --> 02:50:43,130
improve themselves very quickly uh
what's the case you made and what was

8946
02:50:43,130 --> 02:50:43,140
what's the case you made and what was
 

8947
02:50:43,140 --> 02:50:44,510
what's the case you made and what was
the case he made

8948
02:50:44,510 --> 02:50:44,520
the case he made
 

8949
02:50:44,520 --> 02:50:47,090
the case he made
the thing I would say is that among the

8950
02:50:47,090 --> 02:50:47,100
the thing I would say is that among the
 

8951
02:50:47,100 --> 02:50:49,190
the thing I would say is that among the
thing that humans can do humans can do

8952
02:50:49,190 --> 02:50:49,200
thing that humans can do humans can do
 

8953
02:50:49,200 --> 02:50:51,650
thing that humans can do humans can do
is design new AI systems and if you have

8954
02:50:51,650 --> 02:50:51,660
is design new AI systems and if you have
 

8955
02:50:51,660 --> 02:50:52,910
is design new AI systems and if you have
something that is generally smarter than

8956
02:50:52,910 --> 02:50:52,920
something that is generally smarter than
 

8957
02:50:52,920 --> 02:50:54,530
something that is generally smarter than
a human it's probably also generally

8958
02:50:54,530 --> 02:50:54,540
a human it's probably also generally
 

8959
02:50:54,540 --> 02:50:56,929
a human it's probably also generally
smarter at building AI systems this is

8960
02:50:56,929 --> 02:50:56,939
smarter at building AI systems this is
 

8961
02:50:56,939 --> 02:50:59,090
smarter at building AI systems this is

said was more complicated than that and

you'll have like we won't have like one

in in five years in 10 years and in 50

9062
02:52:53,269 --> 02:52:53,279
in in five years in 10 years and in 50
 

9063
02:52:53,279 --> 02:52:57,290
in in five years in 10 years and in 50
years or Beyond and most people like 70

9064
02:52:57,290 --> 02:52:57,300
years or Beyond and most people like 70
 

9065
02:52:57,300 --> 02:53:00,110

percent something like this think it'll

9067
02:53:00,120 --> 02:53:02,809
percent something like this think it'll
be in less than 10 years so uh either in

9068
02:53:02,809 --> 02:53:02,819
be in less than 10 years so uh either in
 

9069
02:53:02,819 --> 02:53:04,610
be in less than 10 years so uh either in

five years or in 10 years
 

9071
02:53:04,620 --> 02:53:07,610

so that's kind of the state the people
 

9073
02:53:07,620 --> 02:53:09,650
so that's kind of the state the people
have a sense that there's a kind of I

9074
02:53:09,650 --> 02:53:09,660
have a sense that there's a kind of I
 

9075
02:53:09,660 --> 02:53:10,969
have a sense that there's a kind of I
mean they're really impressed by the

9076
02:53:10,969 --> 02:53:10,979
mean they're really impressed by the
 

9077
02:53:10,979 --> 02:53:13,190
mean they're really impressed by the

rapid developments of child GPT and gpt4
 

9079
02:53:13,200 --> 02:53:15,290
rapid developments of child GPT and gpt4
so there's a sense that there's uh well

9080
02:53:15,290 --> 02:53:15,300
so there's a sense that there's uh well
 

9081
02:53:15,300 --> 02:53:16,429
so there's a sense that there's uh well
we are

about whether or not we have AGI I think

9088
02:53:23,809 --> 02:53:23,819
about whether or not we have AGI I think
 

9089
02:53:23,819 --> 02:53:25,610
about whether or not we have AGI I think
there's a definite point where everybody

02:53:25,610 --> 02:53:25,620
there's a definite point where everybody
 

9091
02:53:25,620 --> 02:53:27,650
there's a definite point where everybody

9097
02:53:31,979 --> 02:53:33,830
smarter than everybody and like that's
like a definite point of time but like

9098
02:53:33,830 --> 02:53:33,840
like a definite point of time but like
 

9099
02:53:33,840 --> 02:53:36,710
like a definite point of time but like
when do we have AGI like when are people

9100
02:53:36,710 --> 02:53:36,720
when do we have AGI like when are people
 

9101
02:53:36,720 --> 02:53:38,690
when do we have AGI like when are people
fighting over whether or not we have AGI

9102
02:53:38,690 --> 02:53:38,700
fighting over whether or not we have AGI
 

9103
02:53:38,700 --> 02:53:39,769
fighting over whether or not we have AGI
well some people are starting to fight

9104
02:53:39,769 --> 02:53:39,779
well some people are starting to fight
 

9105
02:53:39,779 --> 02:53:42,050
well some people are starting to fight
over it as of gpt4

9106
02:53:42,050 --> 02:53:42,060
over it as of gpt4
 

9107
02:53:42,060 --> 02:53:44,210
over it as of gpt4
but don't you think there's uh going to

9108
02:53:44,210 --> 02:53:44,220
but don't you think there's uh going to
 

9109
02:53:44,220 --> 02:53:46,490
but don't you think there's uh going to
be potentially definitive moments when

9110
02:53:46,490 --> 02:53:46,500
be potentially definitive moments when
 

9111
02:53:46,500 --> 02:53:48,050
be potentially definitive moments when
we say that this is a sentient being

9112

we say that this is a sentient being
 

9113
02:53:48,060 --> 02:53:50,510
we say that this is a sentient being
this is a being that is like we would go

9114
02:53:50,510 --> 02:53:50,520
this is a being that is like we would go
 

9115
02:53:50,520 --> 02:53:52,429
this is a being that is like we would go
to the Supreme Court and say that this

9116
02:53:52,429 --> 02:53:52,439
to the Supreme Court and say that this
 

9117
02:53:52,439 --> 02:53:54,050
to the Supreme Court and say that this
this is essentially being that deserves

9118
02:53:54,050 --> 02:53:54,060
this is essentially being that deserves
 

9119
02:53:54,060 --> 02:53:55,730
this is essentially being that deserves
human rights for example you could make

9120
02:53:55,730 --> 02:53:55,740
human rights for example you could make
 

9121
02:53:55,740 --> 02:53:57,590
human rights for example you could make
yeah like if you prompted being the

9122
02:53:57,590 --> 02:53:57,600
yeah like if you prompted being the
 

9123
02:53:57,600 --> 02:53:59,150
yeah like if you prompted being the
right way could go argue for its own

9124
02:53:59,150 --> 02:53:59,160
right way could go argue for its own

Consciousness in front of the Supreme
 

9127
02:54:00,180 --> 02:54:01,670
Consciousness in front of the Supreme
Court right now I don't think you can do

9128
02:54:01,670 --> 02:54:01,680
Court right now I don't think you can do
 

9129
02:54:01,680 --> 02:54:03,650
Court right now I don't think you can do
that successfully right now because the

9130
02:54:03,650 --> 02:54:03,660
that successfully right now because the
 

9131
02:54:03,660 --> 02:54:04,849
that successfully right now because the
Supreme Court wouldn't believe it well

9132
02:54:04,849 --> 02:54:04,859
Supreme Court wouldn't believe it well
 

9133
02:54:04,859 --> 02:54:06,590
Supreme Court wouldn't believe it well
what makes you think it would then you

9134
02:54:06,590 --> 02:54:06,600
what makes you think it would then you
 

9135
02:54:06,600 --> 02:54:08,210
what makes you think it would then you
could put an actual I think you could

9136
02:54:08,210 --> 02:54:08,220
could put an actual I think you could
 

9137
02:54:08,220 --> 02:54:11,210
could put an actual I think you could
put an iq80 human into a computer and

9138
02:54:11,210 --> 02:54:11,220
put an iq80 human into a computer and
 

9139
02:54:11,220 --> 02:54:12,349
put an iq80 human into a computer and
ask it to argue for its own

9140
02:54:12,349 --> 02:54:12,359
ask it to argue for its own
 

9141
02:54:12,359 --> 02:54:15,290
ask it to argue for its own

own Consciousness before The Supreme
 

9145
02:54:16,500 --> 02:54:18,410
own Consciousness before The Supreme
Court the Supreme Court would be like

9146
02:54:18,410 --> 02:54:18,420
Court the Supreme Court would be like
 

9147
02:54:18,420 --> 02:54:20,450
Court the Supreme Court would be like
you're just a computer even if there was

9148
02:54:20,450 --> 02:54:20,460
you're just a computer even if there was
 

9149
02:54:20,460 --> 02:54:22,849
you're just a computer even if there was
an actual like person in there I think

9150
02:54:22,849 --> 02:54:22,859
an actual like person in there I think
 

9151
02:54:22,859 --> 02:54:24,349
an actual like person in there I think
you're simplifying this no that's not at

9152
02:54:24,349 --> 02:54:24,359
you're simplifying this no that's not at
 

9153
02:54:24,359 --> 02:54:26,150
you're simplifying this no that's not at
all that's that's been the argument uh

9154
02:54:26,150 --> 02:54:26,160
all that's that's been the argument uh
 

9155
02:54:26,160 --> 02:54:27,769
all that's that's been the argument uh
that there's been a lot of arguments

9156
02:54:27,769 --> 02:54:27,779
that there's been a lot of arguments
 

9157

people are already saying that I think

02:55:07,140 --> 02:55:08,990
people are already saying that I think
they're probably mistaken but I'm not

02:55:13,100 --> 02:55:16,190
inside those things
they're not saying that at scale okay so

9200
02:55:16,190 --> 02:55:16,200
they're not saying that at scale okay so
 

9201
02:55:16,200 --> 02:55:17,929
they're not saying that at scale okay so
the question is the I the question is

02:55:17,929 --> 02:55:17,939
the question is the I the question is
 

9203
02:55:17,939 --> 02:55:20,389
the question is the I the question is
there a moment when AGI we know AGI

9204
02:55:20,389 --> 02:55:20,399
there a moment when AGI we know AGI
 

9205
02:55:20,399 --> 02:55:21,710
there a moment when AGI we know AGI
right what would that look like I'm

9206
02:55:21,710 --> 02:55:21,720
right what would that look like I'm
 

9207
02:55:21,720 --> 02:55:23,269
right what would that look like I'm
giving Essentials as an example it could

02:55:23,269 --> 02:55:23,279
giving Essentials as an example it could
 

9209
02:55:23,279 --> 02:55:25,670
giving Essentials as an example it could
be something else it looks like the agis

9210
02:55:25,670 --> 02:55:25,680
be something else it looks like the agis
 

9211
02:55:25,680 --> 02:55:28,969
be something else it looks like the agis

conscious but like who knows what goes
 

9407
02:59:11,819 --> 02:59:13,250
conscious but like who knows what goes
on inside it and it's probably not real

9408
02:59:13,250 --> 02:59:13,260
on inside it and it's probably not real
 

9409
02:59:13,260 --> 02:59:14,630
on inside it and it's probably not real
but you know you can think it's real

9410
02:59:14,630 --> 02:59:14,640
but you know you can think it's real

9415
02:59:18,899 --> 02:59:20,330
not actually an expert on that
and the experts don't know either

and the experts don't know either
 

9417
02:59:20,340 --> 02:59:22,490
and the experts don't know either
because it's kind of hard to predict the

9418
02:59:22,490 --> 02:59:22,500
because it's kind of hard to predict the
 

9419
02:59:22,500 --> 02:59:23,570
because it's kind of hard to predict the
future

9420
02:59:23,570 --> 02:59:23,580
future
 

9421
02:59:23,580 --> 02:59:25,610
future
yeah so

9422
02:59:25,610 --> 02:59:25,620
yeah so
 

9423
02:59:25,620 --> 02:59:27,530
yeah so
um but it's worth trying it's worth

9424
02:59:27,530 --> 02:59:27,540
um but it's worth trying it's worth
 

9425

trying yeah so you you have talked a lot
 

9427
02:59:30,300 --> 02:59:32,450
trying yeah so you you have talked a lot
about sort of the longer term future

9428
02:59:32,450 --> 02:59:32,460
about sort of the longer term future
 

9429
02:59:32,460 --> 02:59:34,250
about sort of the longer term future
where it's all headed

9430
02:59:34,250 --> 02:59:34,260
where it's all headed
 

9431

where it's all headed
I think for by longer term we mean like

9432

I think for by longer term we mean like
not all that long but uh but yeah where

9434
02:59:39,590 --> 02:59:39,600
not all that long but uh but yeah where
 

9435
02:59:39,600 --> 02:59:41,389
not all that long but uh but yeah where
it all had where it all ends up but

9436
02:59:41,389 --> 02:59:41,399
it all had where it all ends up but
 

9437
02:59:41,399 --> 02:59:43,790
it all had where it all ends up but

9471
03:00:21,180 --> 03:00:22,910
that the question of like what leads to
making better or worse predictions what

9472
03:00:22,910 --> 03:00:22,920
making better or worse predictions what
 

9473
03:00:22,920 --> 03:00:24,950
making better or worse predictions what
leads to be able being able to pick out

9474
03:00:24,950 --> 03:00:24,960
leads to be able being able to pick out
 

9475
03:00:24,960 --> 03:00:27,650

you don't think we as humans get

9500
03:00:57,590 --> 03:00:57,600
you don't think we as humans get
 

9501
03:00:57,600 --> 03:01:00,530
you don't think we as humans get
invested in an idea and then others

9502
03:01:00,530 --> 03:01:00,540
invested in an idea and then others
 

9503
03:01:00,540 --> 03:01:01,690
invested in an idea and then others
attack

9504
03:01:01,690 --> 03:01:01,700
attack
 

9505
03:01:01,700 --> 03:01:04,610
attack
you personally for that idea so you

9506
03:01:04,610 --> 03:01:04,620
you personally for that idea so you
 

9507
03:01:04,620 --> 03:01:07,190
you personally for that idea so you
plant your feet and it starts to be

9508
03:01:07,190 --> 03:01:07,200
plant your feet and it starts to be
 

9509
03:01:07,200 --> 03:01:09,530
plant your feet and it starts to be
difficult to when a bunch of

9510
03:01:09,530 --> 03:01:09,540
difficult to when a bunch of
 

9511
03:01:09,540 --> 03:01:12,469
difficult to when a bunch of
low effort attack your idea to

9512
03:01:12,469 --> 03:01:12,479
low effort attack your idea to
 

9513
03:01:12,479 --> 03:01:13,790
low effort attack your idea to
eventually say you know what I actually

9514
03:01:13,790 --> 03:01:13,800
eventually say you know what I actually
 

9515
03:01:13,800 --> 03:01:16,490
eventually say you know what I actually
was wrong and and tell them that it's

9516
03:01:16,490 --> 03:01:16,500
was wrong and and tell them that it's
 

9517
03:01:16,500 --> 03:01:18,410
was wrong and and tell them that it's
it's as a human being it becomes

9518
03:01:18,410 --> 03:01:18,420
it's as a human being it becomes
 

9519
03:01:18,420 --> 03:01:21,110
it's as a human being it becomes
difficult it is it is you know it's

9520
03:01:21,110 --> 03:01:21,120
difficult it is it is you know it's
 

9521
03:01:21,120 --> 03:01:23,929
difficult it is it is you know it's
difficult so like Robin Hansen and I

9522
03:01:23,929 --> 03:01:23,939
difficult so like Robin Hansen and I
 

9523
03:01:23,939 --> 03:01:26,210
difficult so like Robin Hansen and I
debated AI systems and I think that the

9524
03:01:26,210 --> 03:01:26,220
debated AI systems and I think that the
 

9525
03:01:26,220 --> 03:01:28,730
debated AI systems and I think that the
person who won that debate was guern and

9526
03:01:28,730 --> 03:01:28,740
person who won that debate was guern and
 

9527
03:01:28,740 --> 03:01:33,250
person who won that debate was guern and
I think that reality was like

9528
03:01:33,250 --> 03:01:33,260

 

9529
03:01:33,260 --> 03:01:36,349

side of the utkowski handsome Spectrum

9530
03:01:36,349 --> 03:01:36,359
side of the utkowski handsome Spectrum
 

9531
03:01:36,359 --> 03:01:39,050
side of the utkowski handsome Spectrum
like further from utkowski

9532
03:01:39,050 --> 03:01:39,060
like further from utkowski
 

9533
03:01:39,060 --> 03:01:41,450
like further from utkowski
and I think that's because I was like

9534
03:01:41,450 --> 03:01:41,460
and I think that's because I was like
 

9535
03:01:41,460 --> 03:01:44,269
and I think that's because I was like
trying to sound reasonable compared to

9536
03:01:44,269 --> 03:01:44,279
trying to sound reasonable compared to
 

9537
03:01:44,279 --> 03:01:46,429
trying to sound reasonable compared to
Hanson and like saying things that were

9538
03:01:46,429 --> 03:01:46,439
Hanson and like saying things that were
 

9539
03:01:46,439 --> 03:01:49,610
Hanson and like saying things that were
defensible and like relative to Hansen's

9540
03:01:49,610 --> 03:01:49,620
defensible and like relative to Hansen's
 

9541
03:01:49,620 --> 03:01:51,050
defensible and like relative to Hansen's
arguments in reality was like way over

9542
03:01:51,050 --> 03:01:51,060
arguments in reality was like way over
 

9543
03:01:51,060 --> 03:01:53,630
arguments in reality was like way over
here in Pickler in respect to it's like

9544
03:01:53,630 --> 03:01:53,640
here in Pickler in respect to it's like
 

9545
03:01:53,640 --> 03:01:55,250
here in Pickler in respect to it's like
Hanson was like all the systems will be

9546
03:01:55,250 --> 03:01:55,260
Hanson was like all the systems will be
 

9547
03:01:55,260 --> 03:01:56,929
Hanson was like all the systems will be
specialized Hanson May disagree with

9548
03:01:56,929 --> 03:01:56,939
specialized Hanson May disagree with
 

9549
03:01:56,939 --> 03:01:59,030
specialized Hanson May disagree with
this characterization Hanson was like

9550
03:01:59,030 --> 03:01:59,040
this characterization Hanson was like
 

9551
03:01:59,040 --> 03:02:01,130
this characterization Hanson was like
all the systems will be specialized I

9552
03:02:01,130 --> 03:02:01,140
all the systems will be specialized I
 

9553
03:02:01,140 --> 03:02:02,570
all the systems will be specialized I
was like I think we build like

9554
03:02:02,570 --> 03:02:02,580
was like I think we build like
 

9555
03:02:02,580 --> 03:02:05,510
was like I think we build like
specialized underlying systems that when

9556
03:02:05,510 --> 03:02:05,520
specialized underlying systems that when
 

9557
03:02:05,520 --> 03:02:07,490
specialized underlying systems that when
you combine them are good at a wide

9558
03:02:07,490 --> 03:02:07,500
you combine them are good at a wide
 

9559
03:02:07,500 --> 03:02:08,990
you combine them are good at a wide
range of things and the reality is like

9560
03:02:08,990 --> 03:02:09,000
range of things and the reality is like
 

9561
03:02:09,000 --> 03:02:10,429
range of things and the reality is like
no you just like stack more layers into

9562
03:02:10,429 --> 03:02:10,439
no you just like stack more layers into
 

9563
03:02:10,439 --> 03:02:13,969
no you just like stack more layers into
a bunch of gradient descent and

9564
03:02:13,969 --> 03:02:13,979
a bunch of gradient descent and
 

9565
03:02:13,979 --> 03:02:16,790
a bunch of gradient descent and
I feel looking back that like by trying

9566
03:02:16,790 --> 03:02:16,800
I feel looking back that like by trying
 

9567
03:02:16,800 --> 03:02:18,170
I feel looking back that like by trying
to have this reasonable position

9568
03:02:18,170 --> 03:02:18,180
to have this reasonable position
 

9569
03:02:18,180 --> 03:02:20,630
to have this reasonable position
contrasted to Hansen's position

9570
03:02:20,630 --> 03:02:20,640
contrasted to Hansen's position
 

9571
03:02:20,640 --> 03:02:23,990
contrasted to Hansen's position
I missed the ways that reality could be

9572
03:02:23,990 --> 03:02:24,000
I missed the ways that reality could be
 

9573
03:02:24,000 --> 03:02:26,150
I missed the ways that reality could be
like more extreme than my position in

9574
03:02:26,150 --> 03:02:26,160
like more extreme than my position in
 

9575
03:02:26,160 --> 03:02:28,010
like more extreme than my position in
the same direction

9576
03:02:28,010 --> 03:02:28,020
the same direction
 

9577
03:02:28,020 --> 03:02:30,950
the same direction
so is this like

9578
03:02:30,950 --> 03:02:30,960
so is this like
 

9579
03:02:30,960 --> 03:02:32,750
so is this like
like is this a failure to have enough

9580
03:02:32,750 --> 03:02:32,760
like is this a failure to have enough
 

9581
03:02:32,760 --> 03:02:35,630
like is this a failure to have enough
ego is this a failure to like make

9582
03:02:35,630 --> 03:02:35,640
ego is this a failure to like make
 

9583
03:02:35,640 --> 03:02:38,210
ego is this a failure to like make
myself be independent like I I would say

9584
03:02:38,210 --> 03:02:38,220
myself be independent like I I would say
 

9585
03:02:38,220 --> 03:02:41,750
myself be independent like I I would say
that this is something like a failure to

9586
03:02:41,750 --> 03:02:41,760
that this is something like a failure to
 

9587
03:02:41,760 --> 03:02:44,929
that this is something like a failure to
consider positions that would sound even

9588
03:02:44,929 --> 03:02:44,939
consider positions that would sound even
 

9589
03:02:44,939 --> 03:02:47,150
consider positions that would sound even
wackier and more extreme when people are

9590
03:02:47,150 --> 03:02:47,160
wackier and more extreme when people are
 

9591
03:02:47,160 --> 03:02:49,190
wackier and more extreme when people are
already calling you extreme

9592
03:02:49,190 --> 03:02:49,200
already calling you extreme
 

9593
03:02:49,200 --> 03:02:51,530
already calling you extreme
but I wouldn't call that not having

9594
03:02:51,530 --> 03:02:51,540
but I wouldn't call that not having
 

9595
03:02:51,540 --> 03:02:53,030
but I wouldn't call that not having
enough ego

9596
03:02:53,030 --> 03:02:53,040
enough ego
 

9597
03:02:53,040 --> 03:02:55,730
enough ego
I would call that like

9598
03:02:55,730 --> 03:02:55,740
I would call that like
 

9599
03:02:55,740 --> 03:02:58,550
I would call that like
insufficient ability to just like clear

9600
03:02:58,550 --> 03:02:58,560
insufficient ability to just like clear
 

9601
03:02:58,560 --> 03:03:00,889
insufficient ability to just like clear
that all out of your mind

9602
03:03:00,889 --> 03:03:00,899
that all out of your mind
 

9603
03:03:00,899 --> 03:03:03,170
that all out of your mind
in the context of like debate and

9604
03:03:03,170 --> 03:03:03,180
in the context of like debate and
 

9605
03:03:03,180 --> 03:03:05,090
in the context of like debate and
discourse which is already super tricky

9606
03:03:05,090 --> 03:03:05,100
discourse which is already super tricky
 

9607
03:03:05,100 --> 03:03:07,130
discourse which is already super tricky
in the context of prediction in the

9608
03:03:07,130 --> 03:03:07,140
in the context of prediction in the
 

9609
03:03:07,140 --> 03:03:08,750
in the context of prediction in the
context of modeling reality if you're

9610
03:03:08,750 --> 03:03:08,760
context of modeling reality if you're
 

9611
03:03:08,760 --> 03:03:10,010
context of modeling reality if you're
thinking of it as a debate you're

9612
03:03:10,010 --> 03:03:10,020
thinking of it as a debate you're
 

9613
03:03:10,020 --> 03:03:12,410
thinking of it as a debate you're
already screwing up yeah so is there

9614
03:03:12,410 --> 03:03:12,420
already screwing up yeah so is there
 

9615
03:03:12,420 --> 03:03:14,630
already screwing up yeah so is there
some kind of wisdom and insight you can

9616
03:03:14,630 --> 03:03:14,640
some kind of wisdom and insight you can
 

9617
03:03:14,640 --> 03:03:16,670
some kind of wisdom and insight you can
give to how to clear your mind and think

give to how to clear your mind and think
clearly about the world man this is an

9620
03:03:19,730 --> 03:03:19,740
clearly about the world man this is an
 

9621
03:03:19,740 --> 03:03:21,830
clearly about the world man this is an
example of like where I wanted to be

9622
03:03:21,830 --> 03:03:21,840
example of like where I wanted to be
 

9623
03:03:21,840 --> 03:03:23,990
example of like where I wanted to be
able to put people into fmri machines so

9624
03:03:23,990 --> 03:03:24,000
able to put people into fmri machines so
 

9625
03:03:24,000 --> 03:03:25,730
able to put people into fmri machines so
then you'd be like okay see that thing

9626
03:03:25,730 --> 03:03:25,740
then you'd be like okay see that thing
 

9627
03:03:25,740 --> 03:03:27,230
then you'd be like okay see that thing
you just did you were rationalizing

9628
03:03:27,230 --> 03:03:27,240
you just did you were rationalizing
 

9629
03:03:27,240 --> 03:03:29,269
you just did you were rationalizing
right there oh that area of the brain

9630
03:03:29,269 --> 03:03:29,279
right there oh that area of the brain
 

9631
03:03:29,279 --> 03:03:32,570
right there oh that area of the brain
lit up like you are like now being

9632
03:03:32,570 --> 03:03:32,580
lit up like you are like now being
 

9633
03:03:32,580 --> 03:03:34,969
lit up like you are like now being

and you know
I don't know like I want to say like

people introspection is not that easy
 

9643
03:03:43,260 --> 03:03:46,130
people introspection is not that easy
like like notice the internal sensation

9644
03:03:46,130 --> 03:03:46,140
like like notice the internal sensation
 

9645
03:03:46,140 --> 03:03:48,830
like like notice the internal sensation
can you catch yourself in the very

9646
03:03:48,830 --> 03:03:48,840
can you catch yourself in the very
 

9647
03:03:48,840 --> 03:03:52,250
can you catch yourself in the very
moment of feeling a sense of well if I

9648
03:03:52,250 --> 03:03:52,260
moment of feeling a sense of well if I
 

9649

can you now
refuse to let it move you or maybe just

9658
03:04:05,330 --> 03:04:05,340
refuse to let it move you or maybe just
 

9659
03:04:05,340 --> 03:04:07,849
refuse to let it move you or maybe just
make it go away and I feel like I'm

9660
03:04:07,849 --> 03:04:07,859
make it go away and I feel like I'm
 

9661
03:04:07,859 --> 03:04:09,950
make it go away and I feel like I'm
saying like I don't know like somebody's

saying like well
 

9667
03:04:13,380 --> 03:04:15,110
saying like well
just draw an owl

9668
03:04:15,110 --> 03:04:15,120
just draw an owl
 

9669
03:04:15,120 --> 03:04:17,510

03:04:20,389 --> 03:04:20,399
that I feel like most people like the
 

9673
03:04:20,399 --> 03:04:22,130
that I feel like most people like the
advice they need is like well how do I

9674
03:04:22,130 --> 03:04:22,140
advice they need is like well how do I
 

9675

a picture of the future

9858
03:07:54,410 --> 03:07:54,420
a picture of the future
 

9859
03:07:54,420 --> 03:07:56,450
a picture of the future
that is not quite how I expect it to go

9860
03:07:56,450 --> 03:07:56,460
that is not quite how I expect it to go
 

9861
03:07:56,460 --> 03:07:58,790
that is not quite how I expect it to go
where there is public outcry and that

9862
03:07:58,790 --> 03:07:58,800
where there is public outcry and that
 

9863
03:07:58,800 --> 03:08:01,250
where there is public outcry and that
outcris is put into a remotely useful

03:08:01,250 --> 03:08:01,260
outcris is put into a remotely useful
 

9865
03:08:01,260 --> 03:08:02,870
outcris is put into a remotely useful
Direction which I think at this point is

9866
03:08:02,870 --> 03:08:02,880
Direction which I think at this point is
 

9867
03:08:02,880 --> 03:08:04,429
Direction which I think at this point is
is just like shutting down the GPU

9868
03:08:04,429 --> 03:08:04,439
is just like shutting down the GPU
 

9869
03:08:04,439 --> 03:08:05,450
is just like shutting down the GPU
clusters

9870

because no we are we are not in a shape

9872
03:08:08,150 --> 03:08:08,160
because no we are we are not in a shape
 

9873
03:08:08,160 --> 03:08:09,769
because no we are we are not in a shape
that like frantically do at the last

9874
03:08:09,769 --> 03:08:09,779
that like frantically do at the last
 

9875
03:08:09,779 --> 03:08:11,809
that like frantically do at the last
minute through decades worse of worth of

03:08:11,809 --> 03:08:11,819
minute through decades worse of worth of
 

9877

9879
03:08:14,100 --> 03:08:16,130

we like the the thing you would do at

9880
03:08:16,130 --> 03:08:16,140
we like the the thing you would do at
 

9881
03:08:16,140 --> 03:08:17,210
we like the the thing you would do at
this point if there were massive public

9882
03:08:17,210 --> 03:08:17,220
this point if there were massive public
 

9883
03:08:17,220 --> 03:08:18,590
this point if there were massive public
outcry pointed in the right direction

9884
03:08:18,590 --> 03:08:18,600
outcry pointed in the right direction
 

9885
03:08:18,600 --> 03:08:21,889
outcry pointed in the right direction
which I do not expect is shut down the

9886
03:08:21,889 --> 03:08:21,899
which I do not expect is shut down the
 

9887
03:08:21,899 --> 03:08:24,230
which I do not expect is shut down the
GPU clusters and and crash program on

03:08:24,230 --> 03:08:24,240
GPU clusters and and crash program on

oh like you need to engage in mass

right
I I this is this is because there's so

many things where like somebody tells

many things where like somebody tells
 

9931
03:09:08,340 --> 03:09:09,889
many things where like somebody tells
you that the world is ending in like and

you that the world is ending in like and

03:09:09,899 --> 03:09:11,269
you that the world is ending in like and
you need to recycle and if everybody

9934
03:09:11,269 --> 03:09:11,279
you need to recycle and if everybody
 

9935
03:09:11,279 --> 03:09:13,070
you need to recycle and if everybody
does their parting and recycles their

does their parting and recycles their
 

9937
03:09:13,080 --> 03:09:14,510
does their parting and recycles their
their cardboard then then we can all

9938
03:09:14,510 --> 03:09:14,520
their cardboard then then we can all
 

9939
03:09:14,520 --> 03:09:16,070

live happily ever after and this and

9940
03:09:16,070 --> 03:09:16,080
live happily ever after and this and
 

9941
03:09:16,080 --> 03:09:17,870
live happily ever after and this and
this is not

9942
03:09:17,870 --> 03:09:17,880
this is not
 

9943
03:09:17,880 --> 03:09:19,730
this is not
this is unfortunately not what I have to

9944
03:09:19,730 --> 03:09:19,740
this is unfortunately not what I have to
 

9945
03:09:19,740 --> 03:09:23,330
this is unfortunately not what I have to
say they're you know like everybody

9946
03:09:23,330 --> 03:09:23,340
say they're you know like everybody

03:09:23,340 --> 03:09:24,950
say they're you know like everybody
you know everybody recycling their

you know everybody recycling their
 

9949
03:09:24,960 --> 03:09:26,150
you know everybody recycling their
cardboard is not going to fix this

9950
03:09:26,150 --> 03:09:26,160
cardboard is not going to fix this
 

9951
03:09:26,160 --> 03:09:27,469
cardboard is not going to fix this
everybody recycles their cardboard and

9952
03:09:27,469 --> 03:09:27,479
everybody recycles their cardboard and
 

9953
03:09:27,479 --> 03:09:29,929
everybody recycles their cardboard and
then everybody ends up dead

9954
03:09:29,929 --> 03:09:29,939
then everybody ends up dead
 

9955
03:09:29,939 --> 03:09:32,570
then everybody ends up dead
um metaphorically speaking but if there

9956
03:09:32,570 --> 03:09:32,580
um metaphorically speaking but if there
 

9957
03:09:32,580 --> 03:09:35,510
um metaphorically speaking but if there
was enough like like like on the margins

9958
03:09:35,510 --> 03:09:35,520
was enough like like like on the margins
 

9959
03:09:35,520 --> 03:09:37,370
was enough like like like on the margins
you just end up dead a little bit later

9960
03:09:37,370 --> 03:09:37,380
you just end up dead a little bit later
 

9961
03:09:37,380 --> 03:09:38,929
you just end up dead a little bit later
on most of the things you can do that

9962
03:09:38,929 --> 03:09:38,939
on most of the things you can do that
 

9963
03:09:38,939 --> 03:09:41,030
on most of the things you can do that
are that that you know like a few people

9964
03:09:41,030 --> 03:09:41,040
are that that you know like a few people
 

9965
03:09:41,040 --> 03:09:43,730
are that that you know like a few people
can can do by like trying hard

9966
03:09:43,730 --> 03:09:43,740
can can do by like trying hard
 

9967
03:09:43,740 --> 03:09:46,010
can can do by like trying hard
but if there were if there was enough

9968
03:09:46,010 --> 03:09:46,020
but if there were if there was enough
 

9969
03:09:46,020 --> 03:09:48,110
but if there were if there was enough
public outcry to shut down the GPU

9970
03:09:48,110 --> 03:09:48,120
public outcry to shut down the GPU
 

9971
03:09:48,120 --> 03:09:49,670
public outcry to shut down the GPU
clusters and

9972
03:09:49,670 --> 03:09:49,680
clusters and
 

9973
03:09:49,680 --> 03:09:51,469
clusters and
yeah then then you then you could be

9974
03:09:51,469 --> 03:09:51,479
yeah then then you then you could be
 

9975
03:09:51,479 --> 03:09:53,570
yeah then then you then you could be
part of that outcry if Eliezer is wrong

9976
03:09:53,570 --> 03:09:53,580
part of that outcry if Eliezer is wrong
 

9977
03:09:53,580 --> 03:09:55,010
part of that outcry if Eliezer is wrong
in the direction that Lex Friedman

03:09:55,010 --> 03:09:55,020
in the direction that Lex Friedman
 

9979
03:09:55,020 --> 03:09:57,830
in the direction that Lex Friedman
predicts that that there is enough

9980
03:09:57,830 --> 03:09:57,840
predicts that that there is enough
 

9981
03:09:57,840 --> 03:09:59,510
predicts that that there is enough
public outcry pointed enough in the

9982
03:09:59,510 --> 03:09:59,520
public outcry pointed enough in the
 

9983
03:09:59,520 --> 03:10:00,830
public outcry pointed enough in the
right direction to do something that

9984
03:10:00,830 --> 03:10:00,840
right direction to do something that
 

9985
03:10:00,840 --> 03:10:03,769
right direction to do something that
actually actually results in people

9986
03:10:03,769 --> 03:10:03,779
actually actually results in people
 

9987
03:10:03,779 --> 03:10:05,750
actually actually results in people
living

9988
03:10:05,750 --> 03:10:05,760
living
 

9989
03:10:05,760 --> 03:10:07,670
living
not just like we did something not just

9990
03:10:07,670 --> 03:10:07,680
not just like we did something not just
 

9991
03:10:07,680 --> 03:10:09,769
not just like we did something not just
there was an outcry and the outcry was

9992
03:10:09,769 --> 03:10:09,779
there was an outcry and the outcry was
 

9993
03:10:09,779 --> 03:10:11,210
there was an outcry and the outcry was
like given form and something it was

9994
03:10:11,210 --> 03:10:11,220
like given form and something it was
 

9995
03:10:11,220 --> 03:10:12,530
like given form and something it was
like safe and convenient and like didn't

9996
03:10:12,530 --> 03:10:12,540
like safe and convenient and like didn't
 

9997
03:10:12,540 --> 03:10:13,790
like safe and convenient and like didn't
really inconvenience anybody and then

9998
03:10:13,790 --> 03:10:13,800
really inconvenience anybody and then
 

9999
03:10:13,800 --> 03:10:15,590
really inconvenience anybody and then
everybody died everywhere there was

10000
03:10:15,590 --> 03:10:15,600
everybody died everywhere there was
 

10001
03:10:15,600 --> 03:10:18,050
everybody died everywhere there was
enough actual like oh we're going to die

10002
03:10:18,050 --> 03:10:18,060
enough actual like oh we're going to die
 

10003
03:10:18,060 --> 03:10:19,790
enough actual like oh we're going to die
we should not do that we should do

03:10:19,790 --> 03:10:19,800
we should not do that we should do
 

10005
03:10:19,800 --> 03:10:21,349
we should not do that we should do
something else which is not that even if

03:10:21,349 --> 03:10:21,359
something else which is not that even if
 

10007
03:10:21,359 --> 03:10:23,630
something else which is not that even if
it is like not super duper convenient it

10008
03:10:23,630 --> 03:10:23,640
it is like not super duper convenient it
 

10009
03:10:23,640 --> 03:10:24,769
it is like not super duper convenient it
wasn't inside the previous political

10010
03:10:24,769 --> 03:10:24,779
wasn't inside the previous political
 

10011
03:10:24,779 --> 03:10:26,870
wasn't inside the previous political
Overton window if there is that kind of

10012
03:10:26,870 --> 03:10:26,880
Overton window if there is that kind of
 

10013
03:10:26,880 --> 03:10:28,490
Overton window if there is that kind of
public if I am wrong and there is that

public if I am wrong and there is that
 

10015
03:10:28,500 --> 03:10:29,990

than that you could like work on
 

10035
03:10:46,080 --> 03:10:47,630
than that you could like work on
alignment problems where it's harder to

10036
03:10:47,630 --> 03:10:47,640
alignment problems where it's harder to
 

10037

much luck in accepting compliments
gracefully and maybe I should just

10084
03:11:41,269 --> 03:11:41,279
gracefully and maybe I should just
 

10085
03:11:41,279 --> 03:11:44,090
gracefully and maybe I should just
accept that one gracefully but sure well

thank you very much you've painted with
some probability a dark future are you

10090
03:11:49,010 --> 03:11:49,020
some probability a dark future are you
 

10091
03:11:49,020 --> 03:11:52,309
some probability a dark future are you
yourself just when you when you think

10092
03:11:52,309 --> 03:11:52,319
yourself just when you when you think
 

10093
03:11:52,319 --> 03:11:55,010
yourself just when you when you think
when you Ponder your life

10094
03:11:55,010 --> 03:11:55,020
when you Ponder your life
 

10095
03:11:55,020 --> 03:11:57,830
when you Ponder your life
and you Ponder your mortality are you

and you Ponder your mortality are you
 

10097
03:11:57,840 --> 03:12:02,090
and you Ponder your mortality are you
afraid of death

10098

10099
03:12:02,100 --> 03:12:05,870

think so yeah

10100
03:12:05,870 --> 03:12:05,880

 

10101
03:12:05,880 --> 03:12:07,910

does it make any sense to you

10102
03:12:07,910 --> 03:12:07,920
does it make any sense to you
 

10103
03:12:07,920 --> 03:12:09,410
does it make any sense to you
that we die

10104
03:12:09,410 --> 03:12:09,420
that we die
 

10105
03:12:09,420 --> 03:12:15,730
that we die
like what

10106
03:12:15,730 --> 03:12:15,740

 

10107
03:12:15,740 --> 03:12:18,110

there's a power

10108
03:12:18,110 --> 03:12:18,120
there's a power
 

10109
03:12:18,120 --> 03:12:20,330
there's a power
to the finiteness of the human life

10110
03:12:20,330 --> 03:12:20,340
to the finiteness of the human life
 

10111
03:12:20,340 --> 03:12:22,730
to the finiteness of the human life
that's part of this whole machinery

10112
03:12:22,730 --> 03:12:22,740
that's part of this whole machinery
 

10113
03:12:22,740 --> 03:12:26,750
that's part of this whole machinery
of uh Evolution and that finiteness

10114
03:12:26,750 --> 03:12:26,760
of uh Evolution and that finiteness
 

10115
03:12:26,760 --> 03:12:29,150
of uh Evolution and that finiteness
doesn't seem to be obviously integrated

10116
03:12:29,150 --> 03:12:29,160
doesn't seem to be obviously integrated
 

10117
03:12:29,160 --> 03:12:32,870
doesn't seem to be obviously integrated
into it and AI systems

10118
03:12:32,870 --> 03:12:32,880
into it and AI systems
 

10119
03:12:32,880 --> 03:12:34,550
into it and AI systems
so it feels like almost some some

10120
03:12:34,550 --> 03:12:34,560
so it feels like almost some some
 

10121
03:12:34,560 --> 03:12:36,110
so it feels like almost some some
fundamentally in that aspect some

10122
03:12:36,110 --> 03:12:36,120
fundamentally in that aspect some
 

10123
03:12:36,120 --> 03:12:37,790
fundamentally in that aspect some
fundamentally different thing that we're

10124
03:12:37,790 --> 03:12:37,800
fundamentally different thing that we're
 

10125
03:12:37,800 --> 03:12:38,870
fundamentally different thing that we're
creating

that before Humanity was ever here there

10274
03:15:35,090 --> 03:15:35,100
that before Humanity was ever here there
 

10275
03:15:35,100 --> 03:15:37,670
that before Humanity was ever here there
was like some meaning written upon the

10276
03:15:37,670 --> 03:15:37,680
was like some meaning written upon the
 

10277
03:15:37,680 --> 03:15:39,349
was like some meaning written upon the
Stars where you could like go out to the

10278
03:15:39,349 --> 03:15:39,359
Stars where you could like go out to the
 

10279
03:15:39,359 --> 03:15:40,849
Stars where you could like go out to the
star where that meaning was written and

10280
03:15:40,849 --> 03:15:40,859
star where that meaning was written and
 

10281
03:15:40,859 --> 03:15:42,410
star where that meaning was written and
like change it around and thereby

10282
03:15:42,410 --> 03:15:42,420
like change it around and thereby
 

10283
03:15:42,420 --> 03:15:43,550
like change it around and thereby
completely change the meaning of life

10284
03:15:43,550 --> 03:15:43,560
completely change the meaning of life
 

10285
03:15:43,560 --> 03:15:46,670
completely change the meaning of life
right like like the the notion that this

10286
03:15:46,670 --> 03:15:46,680
right like like the the notion that this
 

10287
03:15:46,680 --> 03:15:48,349
right like like the the notion that this
is written on a stone tablet somewhere

10288
03:15:48,349 --> 03:15:48,359
is written on a stone tablet somewhere
 

10289
03:15:48,359 --> 03:15:49,910
is written on a stone tablet somewhere
implies you could like change the tablet

10290
03:15:49,910 --> 03:15:49,920
implies you could like change the tablet
 

10291
03:15:49,920 --> 03:15:51,230
implies you could like change the tablet
and get a different meaning and that

10292
03:15:51,230 --> 03:15:51,240
and get a different meaning and that
 

10293
03:15:51,240 --> 03:15:53,090
and get a different meaning and that
seems kind of wacky doesn't it

10294
03:15:53,090 --> 03:15:53,100
seems kind of wacky doesn't it
 

10295
03:15:53,100 --> 03:15:56,750
seems kind of wacky doesn't it
so it's it's it doesn't feel that

10296
03:15:56,750 --> 03:15:56,760
so it's it's it doesn't feel that
 

10297
03:15:56,760 --> 03:15:58,490
so it's it's it doesn't feel that
mysterious to me at this point it's just

10298
03:15:58,490 --> 03:15:58,500
mysterious to me at this point it's just
 

10299
03:15:58,500 --> 03:16:02,570
mysterious to me at this point it's just
a matter of being like yeah I care

10300
03:16:02,570 --> 03:16:02,580
a matter of being like yeah I care
 

10301

and part of that is uh

10304
03:16:09,290 --> 03:16:09,300
and part of that is uh
 

10305
03:16:09,300 --> 03:16:11,150
and part of that is uh
part of that is the love that connects

part of that is the love that connects
