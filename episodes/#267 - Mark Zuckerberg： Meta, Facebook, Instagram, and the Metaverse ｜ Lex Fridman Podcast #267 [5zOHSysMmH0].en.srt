was first i mean it's not going to be

346
00:06:33,990 --> 00:06:34,000
was first i mean it's not going to be
 

347
00:06:34,000 --> 00:06:35,350

four decades before we have
 

349
00:06:35,360 --> 00:06:37,909
four decades before we have
photorealistic avatars like this

350
00:06:37,909 --> 00:06:37,919
photorealistic avatars like this
 

351
00:06:37,919 --> 00:06:39,909
photorealistic avatars like this
so i think we're much closer to that

352

well i think that's this is like the key
 

385
00:07:11,840 --> 00:07:14,309
well i think that's this is like the key

and that's just different from all the
 

405
00:07:31,520 --> 00:07:33,990
and that's just different from all the
other screens that we have today right

406
00:07:33,990 --> 00:07:34,000
other screens that we have today right
 

407
00:07:34,000 --> 00:07:36,629
other screens that we have today right
phones tvs all the stuff it's you know

they're trying to in some cases deliver
 

411
00:07:38,639 --> 00:07:40,469
they're trying to in some cases deliver
experiences that feel

412
00:07:40,469 --> 00:07:40,479
experiences that feel
 

413
00:07:40,479 --> 00:07:41,670
experiences that feel
um

414
00:07:41,670 --> 00:07:41,680
um
 

415
00:07:41,680 --> 00:07:44,469
um
high fidelity but at no point do you

416
00:07:44,469 --> 00:07:44,479
high fidelity but at no point do you
 

417
00:07:44,479 --> 00:07:46,309
high fidelity but at no point do you
actually feel like you're in it right at

418
00:07:46,309 --> 00:07:46,319
actually feel like you're in it right at
 

419
00:07:46,319 --> 00:07:48,309
actually feel like you're in it right at
some level your content is trying to

420
00:07:48,309 --> 00:07:48,319
some level your content is trying to
 

421
00:07:48,319 --> 00:07:50,629
some level your content is trying to
sort of convince you that this is a

422
00:07:50,629 --> 00:07:50,639
sort of convince you that this is a
 

423
00:07:50,639 --> 00:07:52,230
sort of convince you that this is a
realistic thing that's happening but all

424
00:07:52,230 --> 00:07:52,240
realistic thing that's happening but all
 

425
00:07:52,240 --> 00:07:54,309
realistic thing that's happening but all
of the kind of subtle signals are

426
00:07:54,309 --> 00:07:54,319
of the kind of subtle signals are
 

427
00:07:54,319 --> 00:07:55,430
of the kind of subtle signals are
telling you now you're looking at a

428
00:07:55,430 --> 00:07:55,440
telling you now you're looking at a
 

429
00:07:55,440 --> 00:07:56,390
telling you now you're looking at a
screen

430
00:07:56,390 --> 00:07:56,400
screen
 

431
00:07:56,400 --> 00:07:57,189
screen
so

432
00:07:57,189 --> 00:07:57,199
so
 

433
00:07:57,199 --> 00:07:58,950
so
the question about how you develop these

434
00:07:58,950 --> 00:07:58,960
the question about how you develop these
 

435
00:07:58,960 --> 00:08:00,550
the question about how you develop these
systems is like

436
00:08:00,550 --> 00:08:00,560
systems is like
 

437
00:08:00,560 --> 00:08:02,869
systems is like
what are all of the things that make the

438
00:08:02,869 --> 00:08:02,879
what are all of the things that make the
 

439
00:08:02,879 --> 00:08:05,909
what are all of the things that make the
physical world all the different cues so

440
00:08:05,909 --> 00:08:05,919
physical world all the different cues so
 

441
00:08:05,919 --> 00:08:08,150
physical world all the different cues so
i i think on

442
00:08:08,150 --> 00:08:08,160
i i think on
 

443
00:08:08,160 --> 00:08:10,390
i i think on
visual presence

444
00:08:10,390 --> 00:08:10,400
visual presence
 

445
00:08:10,400 --> 00:08:11,189
visual presence
and

446
00:08:11,189 --> 00:08:11,199
and
 

447
00:08:11,199 --> 00:08:12,950
and
spatial audio

448
00:08:12,950 --> 00:08:12,960
spatial audio
 

449
00:08:12,960 --> 00:08:15,670
spatial audio
we're making reasonable progress spatial

450
00:08:15,670 --> 00:08:15,680
we're making reasonable progress spatial
 

451
00:08:15,680 --> 00:08:17,189
we're making reasonable progress spatial
audio makes a huge deal i don't know if

452
00:08:17,189 --> 00:08:17,199
audio makes a huge deal i don't know if
 

453
00:08:17,199 --> 00:08:19,510
audio makes a huge deal i don't know if
you've tried this experience um

454
00:08:19,510 --> 00:08:19,520
you've tried this experience um
 

455
00:08:19,520 --> 00:08:21,270
you've tried this experience um
workrooms that we launched where you

456
00:08:21,270 --> 00:08:21,280
workrooms that we launched where you
 

457
00:08:21,280 --> 00:08:23,350

food this you know this is how people
are going to work um in the future so we

472

are going to work um in the future so we
 

473
00:08:35,919 --> 00:08:38,709
are going to work um in the future so we
we have to adopt this now

474
00:08:38,709 --> 00:08:38,719
we have to adopt this now
 

475
00:08:38,719 --> 00:08:40,630
we have to adopt this now
and there are already a lot of things

476
00:08:40,630 --> 00:08:40,640
and there are already a lot of things
 

477
00:08:40,640 --> 00:08:42,149
and there are already a lot of things
that i think feel significantly better

478

that i think feel significantly better
 

479
00:08:42,159 --> 00:08:43,029
that i think feel significantly better
than

480

than like typical zoom meetings even
 

483
00:08:44,800 --> 00:08:46,470
than like typical zoom meetings even
though the avatars are a lot lower

484
00:08:46,470 --> 00:08:46,480
though the avatars are a lot lower
 

485

487
00:08:47,680 --> 00:08:48,470
fidelity
um

488
00:08:48,470 --> 00:08:48,480
um
 

489
00:08:48,480 --> 00:08:50,230
um
you know the idea that you have spatial

490
00:08:50,230 --> 00:08:50,240
you know the idea that you have spatial
 

491
00:08:50,240 --> 00:08:52,790

00:08:59,360 --> 00:09:01,590
you can see you know the the the arm
gestures and stuff feel more natural um

502
00:09:01,590 --> 00:09:01,600
gestures and stuff feel more natural um
 

503
00:09:01,600 --> 00:09:03,190
gestures and stuff feel more natural um
you can have side conversations which is

504
00:09:03,190 --> 00:09:03,200
you can have side conversations which is
 

505
00:09:03,200 --> 00:09:04,389
you can have side conversations which is
something that you can't really do in

506
00:09:04,389 --> 00:09:04,399
something that you can't really do in
 

507
00:09:04,399 --> 00:09:06,150
something that you can't really do in
zoom i mean i guess you can text someone

508
00:09:06,150 --> 00:09:06,160
zoom i mean i guess you can text someone
 

509
00:09:06,160 --> 00:09:09,509
zoom i mean i guess you can text someone
over or like out of band but

510
00:09:09,509 --> 00:09:09,519
over or like out of band but
 

511
00:09:09,519 --> 00:09:10,790
over or like out of band but
and if you're actually sitting around a

512
00:09:10,790 --> 00:09:10,800
and if you're actually sitting around a
 

513
00:09:10,800 --> 00:09:13,590
and if you're actually sitting around a
table with people um you know you can

514
00:09:13,590 --> 00:09:13,600
table with people um you know you can
 

515
00:09:13,600 --> 00:09:15,190
table with people um you know you can
lean over and whisper to the person next

516
00:09:15,190 --> 00:09:15,200
lean over and whisper to the person next

to you and like have a conversation that
you can't you know that that you can't

520
00:09:18,550 --> 00:09:18,560
you can't you know that that you can't
 

521
00:09:18,560 --> 00:09:20,310
you can't you know that that you can't
really do with um

522
00:09:20,310 --> 00:09:20,320
really do with um
 

523
00:09:20,320 --> 00:09:23,990
really do with um
in in um in just video communication so

524
00:09:23,990 --> 00:09:24,000
in in um in just video communication so
 

525
00:09:24,000 --> 00:09:25,670
in in um in just video communication so
i think it's interesting

526
00:09:25,670 --> 00:09:25,680
i think it's interesting
 

527
00:09:25,680 --> 00:09:27,350
i think it's interesting
in what ways

528
00:09:27,350 --> 00:09:27,360
in what ways
 

529
00:09:27,360 --> 00:09:29,190
in what ways
some of these things already feel more

530
00:09:29,190 --> 00:09:29,200
some of these things already feel more
 

531
00:09:29,200 --> 00:09:31,430
some of these things already feel more
real than a lot of the technology that

532
00:09:31,430 --> 00:09:31,440
real than a lot of the technology that
 

533
00:09:31,440 --> 00:09:32,470
real than a lot of the technology that
we have

534
00:09:32,470 --> 00:09:32,480
we have
 

535
00:09:32,480 --> 00:09:34,550
we have
even when the visual fidelity isn't

536
00:09:34,550 --> 00:09:34,560
even when the visual fidelity isn't
 

537
00:09:34,560 --> 00:09:35,670
even when the visual fidelity isn't
quite there but i think it'll get there

538
00:09:35,670 --> 00:09:35,680
quite there but i think it'll get there
 

539
00:09:35,680 --> 00:09:37,509
quite there but i think it'll get there
over the next few years now i mean you

540
00:09:37,509 --> 00:09:37,519
over the next few years now i mean you
 

541
00:09:37,519 --> 00:09:39,190
over the next few years now i mean you
were asking about comparing that to the

542
00:09:39,190 --> 00:09:39,200
were asking about comparing that to the
 

543
00:09:39,200 --> 00:09:41,509
were asking about comparing that to the
true physical world not zoom or

544
00:09:41,509 --> 00:09:41,519
true physical world not zoom or
 

545
00:09:41,519 --> 00:09:43,350
true physical world not zoom or
something like that and

546
00:09:43,350 --> 00:09:43,360
something like that and
 

547
00:09:43,360 --> 00:09:45,590
something like that and
there i mean i think you have feelings

548
00:09:45,590 --> 00:09:45,600
there i mean i think you have feelings
 

549
00:09:45,600 --> 00:09:46,949
there i mean i think you have feelings
of like

550
00:09:46,949 --> 00:09:46,959
of like
 

551
00:09:46,959 --> 00:09:48,230
of like
temperature

552
00:09:48,230 --> 00:09:48,240
temperature
 

553
00:09:48,240 --> 00:09:51,750
temperature
um you know olfactory um obviously touch

554
00:09:51,750 --> 00:09:51,760
um you know olfactory um obviously touch
 

555
00:09:51,760 --> 00:09:54,150
um you know olfactory um obviously touch
right we're working on haptic gloves um

556
00:09:54,150 --> 00:09:54,160
right we're working on haptic gloves um
 

557
00:09:54,160 --> 00:09:55,590
right we're working on haptic gloves um
you know the the sense that you want to

558
00:09:55,590 --> 00:09:55,600
you know the the sense that you want to
 

559
00:09:55,600 --> 00:09:57,030
you know the the sense that you want to
be able to you know put your hands down

560
00:09:57,030 --> 00:09:57,040
be able to you know put your hands down
 

561
00:09:57,040 --> 00:09:59,509
be able to you know put your hands down
and feel some pressure from the table um

562
00:09:59,509 --> 00:09:59,519
and feel some pressure from the table um
 

563
00:09:59,519 --> 00:10:00,630
and feel some pressure from the table um
you know all these things i think are

564
00:10:00,630 --> 00:10:00,640
you know all these things i think are
 

565
00:10:00,640 --> 00:10:02,389
you know all these things i think are
going to be really critical to be able

566
00:10:02,389 --> 00:10:02,399
going to be really critical to be able
 

567
00:10:02,399 --> 00:10:05,829
going to be really critical to be able
to keep up this illusion that you're in

568
00:10:05,829 --> 00:10:05,839
to keep up this illusion that you're in
 

569
00:10:05,839 --> 00:10:07,670
to keep up this illusion that you're in
a world and that you're fully present in

570
00:10:07,670 --> 00:10:07,680
a world and that you're fully present in
 

571
00:10:07,680 --> 00:10:09,750
a world and that you're fully present in
this world but i don't know i think

572
00:10:09,750 --> 00:10:09,760
this world but i don't know i think
 

573
00:10:09,760 --> 00:10:10,710
this world but i don't know i think
we're going to have a lot of these

574
00:10:10,710 --> 00:10:10,720
we're going to have a lot of these
 

575
00:10:10,720 --> 00:10:12,870
we're going to have a lot of these
building blocks within you know the next

576
00:10:12,870 --> 00:10:12,880
building blocks within you know the next
 

577
00:10:12,880 --> 00:10:15,030
building blocks within you know the next
10 years or so and even before that i

578
00:10:15,030 --> 00:10:15,040
10 years or so and even before that i
 

579
00:10:15,040 --> 00:10:16,310
10 years or so and even before that i
think it's amazing how much you're just

580
00:10:16,310 --> 00:10:16,320
think it's amazing how much you're just
 

581
00:10:16,320 --> 00:10:18,310
think it's amazing how much you're just
going to build with software that sort

582
00:10:18,310 --> 00:10:18,320
going to build with software that sort
 

583
00:10:18,320 --> 00:10:21,110
going to build with software that sort
of masks some of these things um

584
00:10:21,110 --> 00:10:21,120
of masks some of these things um
 

585
00:10:21,120 --> 00:10:23,110
of masks some of these things um
i i realize i'm going long but i you

586
00:10:23,110 --> 00:10:23,120
i i realize i'm going long but i you
 

587
00:10:23,120 --> 00:10:25,110
i i realize i'm going long but i you
know i was told we have a few hours here

588
00:10:25,110 --> 00:10:25,120
know i was told we have a few hours here
 

589
00:10:25,120 --> 00:10:27,110
know i was told we have a few hours here
yeah so it's here for five to six hours

590
00:10:27,110 --> 00:10:27,120
yeah so it's here for five to six hours
 

591
00:10:27,120 --> 00:10:29,030
yeah so it's here for five to six hours
yeah so i mean it's look i mean that

592
00:10:29,030 --> 00:10:29,040
yeah so i mean it's look i mean that
 

593
00:10:29,040 --> 00:10:30,470
yeah so i mean it's look i mean that
that's that's on the shorter end of the

594
00:10:30,470 --> 00:10:30,480
that's that's on the shorter end of the
 

595
00:10:30,480 --> 00:10:32,470
that's that's on the shorter end of the
congressional testimonies i've done um

596
00:10:32,470 --> 00:10:32,480
congressional testimonies i've done um
 

597
00:10:32,480 --> 00:10:33,910
congressional testimonies i've done um
but it's um

598
00:10:33,910 --> 00:10:33,920
but it's um
 

599
00:10:33,920 --> 00:10:35,430
but it's um
but

600
00:10:35,430 --> 00:10:35,440
but
 

601
00:10:35,440 --> 00:10:36,870
but
you know one of the things that we found

602
00:10:36,870 --> 00:10:36,880
you know one of the things that we found
 

603
00:10:36,880 --> 00:10:37,910
you know one of the things that we found
with

604
00:10:37,910 --> 00:10:37,920
with
 

605
00:10:37,920 --> 00:10:39,910
with
with hand presence right so the the

606
00:10:39,910 --> 00:10:39,920
with hand presence right so the the
 

607
00:10:39,920 --> 00:10:41,990
with hand presence right so the the
earliest vr you just had the headset and

608
00:10:41,990 --> 00:10:42,000
earliest vr you just had the headset and
 

609
00:10:42,000 --> 00:10:43,990
earliest vr you just had the headset and
then um that was cool you could look

610
00:10:43,990 --> 00:10:44,000
then um that was cool you could look
 

611
00:10:44,000 --> 00:10:45,190
then um that was cool you could look
around you feel like you're in a place

612
00:10:45,190 --> 00:10:45,200
around you feel like you're in a place
 

613
00:10:45,200 --> 00:10:46,470
around you feel like you're in a place
but you don't feel like you're really

614
00:10:46,470 --> 00:10:46,480
but you don't feel like you're really
 

615
00:10:46,480 --> 00:10:47,750
but you don't feel like you're really
able to interact with it until you have

616
00:10:47,750 --> 00:10:47,760
able to interact with it until you have
 

617
00:10:47,760 --> 00:10:49,430
able to interact with it until you have
hands and then there's this big question

618
00:10:49,430 --> 00:10:49,440
hands and then there's this big question
 

619
00:10:49,440 --> 00:10:51,590
hands and then there's this big question
where once you got hands what's the

620
00:10:51,590 --> 00:10:51,600
where once you got hands what's the
 

621
00:10:51,600 --> 00:10:55,190
where once you got hands what's the
right way to represent them and

622
00:10:55,190 --> 00:10:55,200
right way to represent them and
 

623
00:10:55,200 --> 00:10:56,630
right way to represent them and
initially

624
00:10:56,630 --> 00:10:56,640
initially
 

625
00:10:56,640 --> 00:10:58,630
initially
all of our assumptions was okay when i

626
00:10:58,630 --> 00:10:58,640
all of our assumptions was okay when i
 

627
00:10:58,640 --> 00:10:59,750
all of our assumptions was okay when i
look down and see my hands in the

628
00:10:59,750 --> 00:10:59,760
look down and see my hands in the
 

629
00:10:59,760 --> 00:11:01,269
look down and see my hands in the
physical world i see an arm and it's

630
00:11:01,269 --> 00:11:01,279
physical world i see an arm and it's
 

631
00:11:01,279 --> 00:11:03,750
physical world i see an arm and it's
gonna be super weird if you see you know

632
00:11:03,750 --> 00:11:03,760
gonna be super weird if you see you know
 

633
00:11:03,760 --> 00:11:05,030
gonna be super weird if you see you know
just your hand

634
00:11:05,030 --> 00:11:05,040
just your hand
 

635
00:11:05,040 --> 00:11:06,230
just your hand
um

636
00:11:06,230 --> 00:11:06,240
um
 

637
00:11:06,240 --> 00:11:07,990
um
but it turned out to not be the case

638
00:11:07,990 --> 00:11:08,000
but it turned out to not be the case
 

639
00:11:08,000 --> 00:11:09,430
but it turned out to not be the case
because there's this issue with your

640
00:11:09,430 --> 00:11:09,440
because there's this issue with your
 

641
00:11:09,440 --> 00:11:10,870
because there's this issue with your
arms which is like what's your elbow

642
00:11:10,870 --> 00:11:10,880
arms which is like what's your elbow
 

643
00:11:10,880 --> 00:11:13,269
arms which is like what's your elbow
angle and if the elbow angle that we're

644
00:11:13,269 --> 00:11:13,279
angle and if the elbow angle that we're
 

645
00:11:13,279 --> 00:11:16,150
angle and if the elbow angle that we're
kind of interpolating based on where

646
00:11:16,150 --> 00:11:16,160
kind of interpolating based on where
 

647
00:11:16,160 --> 00:11:18,550
kind of interpolating based on where
your hand is and where your headset is

648
00:11:18,550 --> 00:11:18,560
your hand is and where your headset is
 

649
00:11:18,560 --> 00:11:20,389
your hand is and where your headset is
actually isn't accurate it creates this

650
00:11:20,389 --> 00:11:20,399
actually isn't accurate it creates this
 

651
00:11:20,399 --> 00:11:22,150
actually isn't accurate it creates this
very uncomfortable feeling where it's

652
00:11:22,150 --> 00:11:22,160
very uncomfortable feeling where it's
 

653
00:11:22,160 --> 00:11:24,069
very uncomfortable feeling where it's
like oh like my arm is actually out like

654
00:11:24,069 --> 00:11:24,079
like oh like my arm is actually out like
 

655
00:11:24,079 --> 00:11:25,750
like oh like my arm is actually out like
this but it's like showing it in here

656
00:11:25,750 --> 00:11:25,760
this but it's like showing it in here
 

657
00:11:25,760 --> 00:11:27,910
this but it's like showing it in here
and that actually broke the the feeling

658
00:11:27,910 --> 00:11:27,920
and that actually broke the the feeling
 

659
00:11:27,920 --> 00:11:30,069
and that actually broke the the feeling
of presence a lot more whereas it turns

660
00:11:30,069 --> 00:11:30,079
of presence a lot more whereas it turns
 

661
00:11:30,079 --> 00:11:31,910
of presence a lot more whereas it turns
out that if you just show the hands and

662
00:11:31,910 --> 00:11:31,920
out that if you just show the hands and
 

663
00:11:31,920 --> 00:11:34,630
out that if you just show the hands and
you don't show the arms um

664
00:11:34,630 --> 00:11:34,640
you don't show the arms um
 

665
00:11:34,640 --> 00:11:36,630
you don't show the arms um
it actually is fine for people so i

666
00:11:36,630 --> 00:11:36,640
it actually is fine for people so i
 

667
00:11:36,640 --> 00:11:38,710
it actually is fine for people so i
think that there's a bunch of these

668
00:11:38,710 --> 00:11:38,720
think that there's a bunch of these
 

669
00:11:38,720 --> 00:11:41,350
think that there's a bunch of these
interesting psychological cues where

670
00:11:41,350 --> 00:11:41,360
interesting psychological cues where
 

671
00:11:41,360 --> 00:11:43,509
interesting psychological cues where
it'll be more about getting the right

672
00:11:43,509 --> 00:11:43,519
it'll be more about getting the right
 

673
00:11:43,519 --> 00:11:45,990
it'll be more about getting the right
details right and i think a lot of that

674
00:11:45,990 --> 00:11:46,000
details right and i think a lot of that
 

675
00:11:46,000 --> 00:11:47,990
details right and i think a lot of that
will be possible even over you know a

676
00:11:47,990 --> 00:11:48,000
will be possible even over you know a
 

677
00:11:48,000 --> 00:11:49,750
will be possible even over you know a
few year period or five year period and

678
00:11:49,750 --> 00:11:49,760
few year period or five year period and
 

679
00:11:49,760 --> 00:11:51,350
few year period or five year period and
we won't need like every single thing to

680
00:11:51,350 --> 00:11:51,360
we won't need like every single thing to
 

681
00:11:51,360 --> 00:11:53,269
we won't need like every single thing to
be solved to deliver this like full

682
00:11:53,269 --> 00:11:53,279
be solved to deliver this like full
 

683
00:11:53,279 --> 00:11:54,870
be solved to deliver this like full
sense of presence yeah it's a

684
00:11:54,870 --> 00:11:54,880
sense of presence yeah it's a
 

685
00:11:54,880 --> 00:11:57,509
sense of presence yeah it's a
fascinating psychology question of what

686
00:11:57,509 --> 00:11:57,519
fascinating psychology question of what
 

687
00:11:57,519 --> 00:11:58,470
fascinating psychology question of what
is

688
00:11:58,470 --> 00:11:58,480
is
 

689
00:11:58,480 --> 00:11:59,829
is
the essence

690
00:11:59,829 --> 00:11:59,839
the essence
 

691
00:11:59,839 --> 00:12:03,509
the essence
that makes in-person conversation um

692
00:12:03,509 --> 00:12:03,519
that makes in-person conversation um
 

693
00:12:03,519 --> 00:12:06,069
that makes in-person conversation um
special it's like emojis are able to

694
00:12:06,069 --> 00:12:06,079
special it's like emojis are able to
 

695
00:12:06,079 --> 00:12:08,310
special it's like emojis are able to
convey emotion really well even though

696
00:12:08,310 --> 00:12:08,320
convey emotion really well even though
 

697
00:12:08,320 --> 00:12:10,470
convey emotion really well even though
they're obviously not photorealistic

698
00:12:10,470 --> 00:12:10,480
they're obviously not photorealistic
 

699
00:12:10,480 --> 00:12:12,069
they're obviously not photorealistic
and so in that same way just like you're

700
00:12:12,069 --> 00:12:12,079
and so in that same way just like you're
 

701
00:12:12,079 --> 00:12:14,389
and so in that same way just like you're
saying just showing the hands is able to

702
00:12:14,389 --> 00:12:14,399
saying just showing the hands is able to
 

703
00:12:14,399 --> 00:12:17,110
saying just showing the hands is able to
uh create a comfortable expression with

704
00:12:17,110 --> 00:12:17,120
uh create a comfortable expression with
 

705
00:12:17,120 --> 00:12:19,269
uh create a comfortable expression with
your hands so i wonder what that is you

706
00:12:19,269 --> 00:12:19,279
your hands so i wonder what that is you
 

707
00:12:19,279 --> 00:12:21,110
your hands so i wonder what that is you
know people in in the world wars used to

708
00:12:21,110 --> 00:12:21,120
know people in in the world wars used to
 

709
00:12:21,120 --> 00:12:22,790
know people in in the world wars used to
write letters and you can fall in love

710
00:12:22,790 --> 00:12:22,800
write letters and you can fall in love
 

711
00:12:22,800 --> 00:12:25,030
write letters and you can fall in love
with just writing letters you don't need

712
00:12:25,030 --> 00:12:25,040
with just writing letters you don't need
 

713
00:12:25,040 --> 00:12:26,790
with just writing letters you don't need
to see each other in person you can

714
00:12:26,790 --> 00:12:26,800
to see each other in person you can
 

715
00:12:26,800 --> 00:12:29,190
to see each other in person you can
convey emotion you can a

716
00:12:29,190 --> 00:12:29,200
convey emotion you can a
 

717
00:12:29,200 --> 00:12:30,949
convey emotion you can a
depth of uh

718
00:12:30,949 --> 00:12:30,959
depth of uh
 

719
00:12:30,959 --> 00:12:34,150
depth of uh
experience with just words so that's a i

720
00:12:34,150 --> 00:12:34,160
experience with just words so that's a i
 

721
00:12:34,160 --> 00:12:36,150
experience with just words so that's a i
think a fascinating place to explore

722
00:12:36,150 --> 00:12:36,160
think a fascinating place to explore
 

723
00:12:36,160 --> 00:12:38,069
think a fascinating place to explore
psychology of like how do you find that

724
00:12:38,069 --> 00:12:38,079
psychology of like how do you find that
 

725
00:12:38,079 --> 00:12:40,470
psychology of like how do you find that
intimacy yeah and you know the way that

726
00:12:40,470 --> 00:12:40,480
intimacy yeah and you know the way that
 

727
00:12:40,480 --> 00:12:42,550
intimacy yeah and you know the way that
i come to all of this stuff is you know

728
00:12:42,550 --> 00:12:42,560
i come to all of this stuff is you know
 

729
00:12:42,560 --> 00:12:43,990
i come to all of this stuff is you know
i basically studied psychology and

730
00:12:43,990 --> 00:12:44,000
i basically studied psychology and
 

731
00:12:44,000 --> 00:12:46,710
i basically studied psychology and
computer science so all of the work that

732
00:12:46,710 --> 00:12:46,720
computer science so all of the work that
 

733
00:12:46,720 --> 00:12:47,750
computer science so all of the work that
i do

734
00:12:47,750 --> 00:12:47,760
i do
 

735
00:12:47,760 --> 00:12:49,430
i do
is sort of at the intersection of those

736
00:12:49,430 --> 00:12:49,440
is sort of at the intersection of those
 

737
00:12:49,440 --> 00:12:51,350
is sort of at the intersection of those
things i think most of the other big

738
00:12:51,350 --> 00:12:51,360
things i think most of the other big
 

739
00:12:51,360 --> 00:12:53,750
things i think most of the other big
tech companies are building technology

740
00:12:53,750 --> 00:12:53,760
tech companies are building technology
 

741
00:12:53,760 --> 00:12:55,430
tech companies are building technology
for you to interact with what i care

742
00:12:55,430 --> 00:12:55,440
for you to interact with what i care
 

743
00:12:55,440 --> 00:12:56,790
for you to interact with what i care
about is building technology to help

744
00:12:56,790 --> 00:12:56,800
about is building technology to help
 

745
00:12:56,800 --> 00:12:58,310
about is building technology to help
people interact with each other so it's

746
00:12:58,310 --> 00:12:58,320
people interact with each other so it's
 

747
00:12:58,320 --> 00:12:59,350
people interact with each other so it's
i think it's a somewhat different

748
00:12:59,350 --> 00:12:59,360
i think it's a somewhat different
 

749
00:12:59,360 --> 00:13:01,350
i think it's a somewhat different
approach than most of the other tech

750
00:13:01,350 --> 00:13:01,360
approach than most of the other tech
 

751
00:13:01,360 --> 00:13:03,350
approach than most of the other tech
entrepreneurs and and big companies come

and
 

757
00:13:06,720 --> 00:13:08,790
and
a lot of the lessons

758
00:13:08,790 --> 00:13:08,800
a lot of the lessons
 

759
00:13:08,800 --> 00:13:10,310
a lot of the lessons
in terms of how i think about designing

760
00:13:10,310 --> 00:13:10,320
in terms of how i think about designing
 

761
00:13:10,320 --> 00:13:12,470
in terms of how i think about designing
products come from

762
00:13:12,470 --> 00:13:12,480
products come from
 

763
00:13:12,480 --> 00:13:15,590
products come from
some just basic elements of psychology

764
00:13:15,590 --> 00:13:15,600
some just basic elements of psychology
 

765
00:13:15,600 --> 00:13:18,870
some just basic elements of psychology
right in terms of you know our brains

766
00:13:18,870 --> 00:13:18,880
right in terms of you know our brains
 

767
00:13:18,880 --> 00:13:20,230
right in terms of you know our brains
you know you can compare to the brains

768
00:13:20,230 --> 00:13:20,240
you know you can compare to the brains
 

769
00:13:20,240 --> 00:13:22,389
you know you can compare to the brains
of other animals you know we're very

770
00:13:22,389 --> 00:13:22,399
of other animals you know we're very
 

771
00:13:22,399 --> 00:13:24,389
of other animals you know we're very
wired to specific things facial

772
00:13:24,389 --> 00:13:24,399
wired to specific things facial
 

773
00:13:24,399 --> 00:13:26,470
wired to specific things facial
expressions right we're

774
00:13:26,470 --> 00:13:26,480
expressions right we're
 

775
00:13:26,480 --> 00:13:28,550
expressions right we're
we're very visual right so compared to

776
00:13:28,550 --> 00:13:28,560
we're very visual right so compared to
 

777
00:13:28,560 --> 00:13:29,829
we're very visual right so compared to
other animals i mean that's that's

778
00:13:29,829 --> 00:13:29,839
other animals i mean that's that's
 

779
00:13:29,839 --> 00:13:31,990
other animals i mean that's that's
clearly the the main sense that most

780
00:13:31,990 --> 00:13:32,000
clearly the the main sense that most
 

781
00:13:32,000 --> 00:13:33,829
clearly the the main sense that most
people have

782
00:13:33,829 --> 00:13:33,839
people have
 

783
00:13:33,839 --> 00:13:35,110
people have
but there's a whole part of your brain

784
00:13:35,110 --> 00:13:35,120
but there's a whole part of your brain
 

785
00:13:35,120 --> 00:13:36,949
but there's a whole part of your brain
that's just kind of focused on on

786
00:13:36,949 --> 00:13:36,959
that's just kind of focused on on
 

787
00:13:36,959 --> 00:13:39,430
that's just kind of focused on on
reading facial cues so you know when

788
00:13:39,430 --> 00:13:39,440
reading facial cues so you know when
 

789
00:13:39,440 --> 00:13:41,430
reading facial cues so you know when
we're designing the next version of

790
00:13:41,430 --> 00:13:41,440
we're designing the next version of
 

791
00:13:41,440 --> 00:13:44,470
we're designing the next version of
quest or the vr headset a big focus for

792
00:13:44,470 --> 00:13:44,480
quest or the vr headset a big focus for
 

793
00:13:44,480 --> 00:13:46,790
quest or the vr headset a big focus for
us is face tracking and basically eye

794
00:13:46,790 --> 00:13:46,800
us is face tracking and basically eye
 

795
00:13:46,800 --> 00:13:48,710
us is face tracking and basically eye
tracking so you can make eye contact

796
00:13:48,710 --> 00:13:48,720
tracking so you can make eye contact
 

797
00:13:48,720 --> 00:13:50,069
tracking so you can make eye contact
which again isn't really something that

798
00:13:50,069 --> 00:13:50,079
which again isn't really something that
 

799
00:13:50,079 --> 00:13:51,509
which again isn't really something that
you can do over a video conference it's

800
00:13:51,509 --> 00:13:51,519
you can do over a video conference it's
 

801
00:13:51,519 --> 00:13:52,949
you can do over a video conference it's
sort of amazing how

802
00:13:52,949 --> 00:13:52,959
sort of amazing how
 

803
00:13:52,959 --> 00:13:55,590
sort of amazing how
much um how far video conferencing has

804
00:13:55,590 --> 00:13:55,600
much um how far video conferencing has
 

805
00:13:55,600 --> 00:13:57,750
much um how far video conferencing has
gotten without the ability to make eye

806
00:13:57,750 --> 00:13:57,760
gotten without the ability to make eye
 

807
00:13:57,760 --> 00:13:59,670
gotten without the ability to make eye
contact right it's sort of a bizarre

808
00:13:59,670 --> 00:13:59,680
contact right it's sort of a bizarre
 

809
00:13:59,680 --> 00:14:00,629
contact right it's sort of a bizarre
thing if you think about it you're like

810
00:14:00,629 --> 00:14:00,639
thing if you think about it you're like
 

811
00:14:00,639 --> 00:14:03,030
thing if you think about it you're like
looking at someone's face um you know

812
00:14:03,030 --> 00:14:03,040
looking at someone's face um you know
 

813
00:14:03,040 --> 00:14:04,470
looking at someone's face um you know
sometimes for you know an hour when

814
00:14:04,470 --> 00:14:04,480
sometimes for you know an hour when
 

815
00:14:04,480 --> 00:14:06,550
sometimes for you know an hour when
you're in a meeting and like

816
00:14:06,550 --> 00:14:06,560
you're in a meeting and like
 

817
00:14:06,560 --> 00:14:08,389
you're in a meeting and like
you looking at their eyes

818
00:14:08,389 --> 00:14:08,399
you looking at their eyes
 

819
00:14:08,399 --> 00:14:10,150
you looking at their eyes

question is am i supposed to look at the

840
00:14:24,710 --> 00:14:24,720
question is am i supposed to look at the
 

841
00:14:24,720 --> 00:14:27,030
question is am i supposed to look at the
camera so that way you can you know have

842
00:14:27,030 --> 00:14:27,040
camera so that way you can you know have
 

843
00:14:27,040 --> 00:14:28,550
camera so that way you can you know have
a sensation that i'm looking at you i

844
00:14:28,550 --> 00:14:28,560
a sensation that i'm looking at you i
 

845
00:14:28,560 --> 00:14:29,509
a sensation that i'm looking at you i
think that that's an interesting

846
00:14:29,509 --> 00:14:29,519
think that that's an interesting
 

847
00:14:29,519 --> 00:14:32,949
think that that's an interesting
question and then you know with vr

848
00:14:32,949 --> 00:14:32,959
question and then you know with vr
 

849
00:14:32,959 --> 00:14:34,870
question and then you know with vr
um today even without

850
00:14:34,870 --> 00:14:34,880
um today even without
 

851
00:14:34,880 --> 00:14:36,310
um today even without
eye tracking and knowing what your eyes

852
00:14:36,310 --> 00:14:36,320
eye tracking and knowing what your eyes
 

853
00:14:36,320 --> 00:14:38,150
eye tracking and knowing what your eyes
are actually looking at you can fake it

854
00:14:38,150 --> 00:14:38,160
are actually looking at you can fake it
 

855
00:14:38,160 --> 00:14:40,230
are actually looking at you can fake it
reasonably well right so you can look at

856
00:14:40,230 --> 00:14:40,240
reasonably well right so you can look at
 

857
00:14:40,240 --> 00:14:42,550
reasonably well right so you can look at
like where the head pose is and if it

858
00:14:42,550 --> 00:14:42,560
like where the head pose is and if it
 

859
00:14:42,560 --> 00:14:43,750
like where the head pose is and if it
looks like i'm kind of looking in your

860
00:14:43,750 --> 00:14:43,760
looks like i'm kind of looking in your
 

861
00:14:43,760 --> 00:14:45,910
looks like i'm kind of looking in your
general direction then you can sort of

862
00:14:45,910 --> 00:14:45,920
general direction then you can sort of
 

863
00:14:45,920 --> 00:14:47,269
general direction then you can sort of
assume that maybe there's some eye

864
00:14:47,269 --> 00:14:47,279
assume that maybe there's some eye
 

865
00:14:47,279 --> 00:14:49,910
assume that maybe there's some eye
contact intended and and you can do it

866
00:14:49,910 --> 00:14:49,920
contact intended and and you can do it
 

867
00:14:49,920 --> 00:14:51,269
contact intended and and you can do it
in a way where it's okay maybe not it's

868
00:14:51,269 --> 00:14:51,279
in a way where it's okay maybe not it's
 

869
00:14:51,279 --> 00:14:53,030
in a way where it's okay maybe not it's
like a maybe it's not a

870
00:14:53,030 --> 00:14:53,040
like a maybe it's not a
 

871
00:14:53,040 --> 00:14:56,069
like a maybe it's not a
fixated stare but um but it's it's

872
00:14:56,069 --> 00:14:56,079
fixated stare but um but it's it's
 

873
00:14:56,079 --> 00:14:57,829
fixated stare but um but it's it's
somewhat natural but once you have

874
00:14:57,829 --> 00:14:57,839
somewhat natural but once you have
 

875
00:14:57,839 --> 00:14:59,590
somewhat natural but once you have
actual eye tracking you can you can do

876
00:14:59,590 --> 00:14:59,600
actual eye tracking you can you can do
 

877
00:14:59,600 --> 00:15:01,350
actual eye tracking you can you can do
it for real and i think that's really

878
00:15:01,350 --> 00:15:01,360
it for real and i think that's really
 

879
00:15:01,360 --> 00:15:03,030
it for real and i think that's really
important stuff so when i think about

880
00:15:03,030 --> 00:15:03,040
important stuff so when i think about
 

881
00:15:03,040 --> 00:15:05,269
important stuff so when i think about
meta's contribution to this field i have

882
00:15:05,269 --> 00:15:05,279
meta's contribution to this field i have
 

883
00:15:05,279 --> 00:15:07,110
meta's contribution to this field i have
to say it's not clear to me that any of

884
00:15:07,110 --> 00:15:07,120
to say it's not clear to me that any of
 

885
00:15:07,120 --> 00:15:10,150
to say it's not clear to me that any of
the other companies that are focused on

886
00:15:10,150 --> 00:15:10,160
the other companies that are focused on
 

887
00:15:10,160 --> 00:15:11,990
the other companies that are focused on
on the metaverse or on virtual and

888
00:15:11,990 --> 00:15:12,000
on the metaverse or on virtual and
 

889
00:15:12,000 --> 00:15:14,230
on the metaverse or on virtual and
augmented reality are gonna prioritize

890
00:15:14,230 --> 00:15:14,240
augmented reality are gonna prioritize
 

891
00:15:14,240 --> 00:15:15,750
augmented reality are gonna prioritize
putting these features in the hardware

892
00:15:15,750 --> 00:15:15,760
putting these features in the hardware
 

893
00:15:15,760 --> 00:15:16,550
putting these features in the hardware
because

894
00:15:16,550 --> 00:15:16,560
because
 

895
00:15:16,560 --> 00:15:18,069
because
like everything they're trade-offs right

896
00:15:18,069 --> 00:15:18,079
like everything they're trade-offs right
 

897
00:15:18,079 --> 00:15:20,629
like everything they're trade-offs right
i mean they it adds it adds some weight

898
00:15:20,629 --> 00:15:20,639
i mean they it adds it adds some weight
 

899
00:15:20,639 --> 00:15:22,069
i mean they it adds it adds some weight
to the device maybe it adds some

900
00:15:22,069 --> 00:15:22,079
to the device maybe it adds some
 

901
00:15:22,079 --> 00:15:23,750
to the device maybe it adds some
thickness you could totally see another

902
00:15:23,750 --> 00:15:23,760
thickness you could totally see another
 

903
00:15:23,760 --> 00:15:25,189
thickness you could totally see another
company taking the approach let's just

904
00:15:25,189 --> 00:15:25,199
company taking the approach let's just
 

905
00:15:25,199 --> 00:15:26,629
company taking the approach let's just
make the lightest and thinnest thing

906
00:15:26,629 --> 00:15:26,639
make the lightest and thinnest thing
 

907
00:15:26,639 --> 00:15:28,870
make the lightest and thinnest thing
possible but you know i want us to

908
00:15:28,870 --> 00:15:28,880
possible but you know i want us to
 

909
00:15:28,880 --> 00:15:31,189
possible but you know i want us to
design the most human thing possible uh

910
00:15:31,189 --> 00:15:31,199
design the most human thing possible uh
 

911
00:15:31,199 --> 00:15:32,710
design the most human thing possible uh
that that creates the richest sense of

912
00:15:32,710 --> 00:15:32,720
that that creates the richest sense of
 

913
00:15:32,720 --> 00:15:35,189
that that creates the richest sense of
presence and um because so much of of

914
00:15:35,189 --> 00:15:35,199
presence and um because so much of of
 

915
00:15:35,199 --> 00:15:36,150
presence and um because so much of of
human

916
00:15:36,150 --> 00:15:36,160
human
 

917
00:15:36,160 --> 00:15:38,230
human
um emotion and expression comes from

918
00:15:38,230 --> 00:15:38,240
um emotion and expression comes from
 

919
00:15:38,240 --> 00:15:39,670
um emotion and expression comes from
these like micro movements if i like

920
00:15:39,670 --> 00:15:39,680
these like micro movements if i like
 

921
00:15:39,680 --> 00:15:41,829
these like micro movements if i like
move my eyebrow you know millimeter you

922
00:15:41,829 --> 00:15:41,839
move my eyebrow you know millimeter you
 

923
00:15:41,839 --> 00:15:43,430
move my eyebrow you know millimeter you
will notice and that like means

924
00:15:43,430 --> 00:15:43,440
will notice and that like means
 

925
00:15:43,440 --> 00:15:45,189
will notice and that like means
something um so the fact that we're

926
00:15:45,189 --> 00:15:45,199
something um so the fact that we're
 

927
00:15:45,199 --> 00:15:47,430
something um so the fact that we're
losing these signals um in a lot of

928
00:15:47,430 --> 00:15:47,440
losing these signals um in a lot of
 

929
00:15:47,440 --> 00:15:49,509
losing these signals um in a lot of
communication i think is is is a loss

930
00:15:49,509 --> 00:15:49,519
communication i think is is is a loss
 

931
00:15:49,519 --> 00:15:50,949
communication i think is is is a loss
and it's so it's not like okay there's

932
00:15:50,949 --> 00:15:50,959
and it's so it's not like okay there's
 

933
00:15:50,959 --> 00:15:52,790
and it's so it's not like okay there's
one feature and you add this then it all

934
00:15:52,790 --> 00:15:52,800
one feature and you add this then it all
 

935
00:15:52,800 --> 00:15:53,749
one feature and you add this then it all
of a sudden is going to feel like we

936
00:15:53,749 --> 00:15:53,759
of a sudden is going to feel like we
 

937
00:15:53,759 --> 00:15:55,670
of a sudden is going to feel like we
have real presence you can sort of look

938
00:15:55,670 --> 00:15:55,680
have real presence you can sort of look
 

939
00:15:55,680 --> 00:15:58,389
have real presence you can sort of look
at how the the human brain works and how

940
00:15:58,389 --> 00:15:58,399
at how the the human brain works and how
 

941
00:15:58,399 --> 00:16:00,949
at how the the human brain works and how
we we express and and kind of read

942
00:16:00,949 --> 00:16:00,959
we we express and and kind of read
 

943
00:16:00,959 --> 00:16:03,110
we we express and and kind of read
emotions and you can just build a road

944
00:16:03,110 --> 00:16:03,120
emotions and you can just build a road
 

945
00:16:03,120 --> 00:16:05,430
emotions and you can just build a road
map of that you know of just what are

946
00:16:05,430 --> 00:16:05,440
map of that you know of just what are
 

947
00:16:05,440 --> 00:16:06,710
map of that you know of just what are
the most important things to try to

948
00:16:06,710 --> 00:16:06,720
the most important things to try to
 

949
00:16:06,720 --> 00:16:08,389
the most important things to try to
unlock over a five to ten year period

950
00:16:08,389 --> 00:16:08,399
unlock over a five to ten year period
 

951
00:16:08,399 --> 00:16:10,150
unlock over a five to ten year period
and just try to make the experience more

952
00:16:10,150 --> 00:16:10,160
and just try to make the experience more
 

953
00:16:10,160 --> 00:16:12,710
and just try to make the experience more
and more human and social

954
00:16:12,710 --> 00:16:12,720
and more human and social
 

955
00:16:12,720 --> 00:16:14,150
and more human and social
when do you think

956
00:16:14,150 --> 00:16:14,160
when do you think
 

957
00:16:14,160 --> 00:16:16,470
when do you think
would be uh a moment

958
00:16:16,470 --> 00:16:16,480
would be uh a moment
 

959
00:16:16,480 --> 00:16:18,470
would be uh a moment
like a singularity moment for the

960
00:16:18,470 --> 00:16:18,480
like a singularity moment for the
 

961
00:16:18,480 --> 00:16:20,550
like a singularity moment for the
metaverse where

962
00:16:20,550 --> 00:16:20,560
metaverse where
 

963
00:16:20,560 --> 00:16:21,749
metaverse where
there's a lot of ways to ask this

964
00:16:21,749 --> 00:16:21,759
there's a lot of ways to ask this
 

965
00:16:21,759 --> 00:16:23,749
there's a lot of ways to ask this
question but you know

966
00:16:23,749 --> 00:16:23,759
question but you know
 

967
00:16:23,759 --> 00:16:25,350
question but you know
people will have

968
00:16:25,350 --> 00:16:25,360
people will have
 

969
00:16:25,360 --> 00:16:27,350
people will have
many or most of their meaningful

970
00:16:27,350 --> 00:16:27,360
many or most of their meaningful
 

971
00:16:27,360 --> 00:16:30,470
many or most of their meaningful
experiences in the metaverse versus the

972
00:16:30,470 --> 00:16:30,480
experiences in the metaverse versus the
 

973
00:16:30,480 --> 00:16:32,150
experiences in the metaverse versus the
real world and actually it's interesting

974
00:16:32,150 --> 00:16:32,160
real world and actually it's interesting
 

975
00:16:32,160 --> 00:16:34,069
real world and actually it's interesting
to think about the fact that a lot of

976
00:16:34,069 --> 00:16:34,079
to think about the fact that a lot of
 

977
00:16:34,079 --> 00:16:35,350
to think about the fact that a lot of

991
00:16:48,800 --> 00:16:50,629
stuff that is happening on a 2d digital
plane when do you think the metaverse

992
00:16:50,629 --> 00:16:50,639
plane when do you think the metaverse
 

993
00:16:50,639 --> 00:16:52,949
plane when do you think the metaverse
will provide those experiences

994
00:16:52,949 --> 00:16:52,959
will provide those experiences
 

995
00:16:52,959 --> 00:16:55,189
will provide those experiences
for a large number like a yeah i think

996
00:16:55,189 --> 00:16:55,199
for a large number like a yeah i think
 

997
00:16:55,199 --> 00:16:57,110
for a large number like a yeah i think
it's a really popular good question

998
00:16:57,110 --> 00:16:57,120
it's a really popular good question
 

999
00:16:57,120 --> 00:16:58,470
it's a really popular good question
there was

1000
00:16:58,470 --> 00:16:58,480
there was
 

1001
00:16:58,480 --> 00:17:00,310
there was
someone you know i read this piece that

1002
00:17:00,310 --> 00:17:00,320
someone you know i read this piece that
 

1003
00:17:00,320 --> 00:17:02,710
someone you know i read this piece that
frame this says

1004
00:17:02,710 --> 00:17:02,720
frame this says
 

1005
00:17:02,720 --> 00:17:04,390
frame this says
a lot of people think that the metaverse

1006
00:17:04,390 --> 00:17:04,400
a lot of people think that the metaverse
 

1007
00:17:04,400 --> 00:17:05,909
a lot of people think that the metaverse
is about a place

1008
00:17:05,909 --> 00:17:05,919
is about a place
 

1009
00:17:05,919 --> 00:17:06,789
is about a place
but

1010
00:17:06,789 --> 00:17:06,799
but
 

1011
00:17:06,799 --> 00:17:09,110
but
one definition of this is it's about

1012
00:17:09,110 --> 00:17:09,120
one definition of this is it's about
 

1013
00:17:09,120 --> 00:17:12,230
one definition of this is it's about
a time when basically immersive digital

1014
00:17:12,230 --> 00:17:12,240
a time when basically immersive digital
 

1015
00:17:12,240 --> 00:17:15,510
a time when basically immersive digital
worlds become the primary way that we

1016
00:17:15,510 --> 00:17:15,520
worlds become the primary way that we
 

1017
00:17:15,520 --> 00:17:17,429
worlds become the primary way that we
that we live our lives and spend our

1018
00:17:17,429 --> 00:17:17,439
that we live our lives and spend our
 

1019
00:17:17,439 --> 00:17:19,510
that we live our lives and spend our
time um i think that's a reasonable

1020
00:17:19,510 --> 00:17:19,520
time um i think that's a reasonable
 

1021
00:17:19,520 --> 00:17:21,590
time um i think that's a reasonable
construct and from that perspective you

1022
00:17:21,590 --> 00:17:21,600
construct and from that perspective you
 

1023
00:17:21,600 --> 00:17:23,429
construct and from that perspective you
know i think um

1024
00:17:23,429 --> 00:17:23,439
know i think um
 

1025
00:17:23,439 --> 00:17:24,630
know i think um
you also just want to look at this as a

1026
00:17:24,630 --> 00:17:24,640
you also just want to look at this as a
 

1027
00:17:24,640 --> 00:17:26,710
you also just want to look at this as a
continuation because it's not like

1028
00:17:26,710 --> 00:17:26,720
continuation because it's not like
 

1029
00:17:26,720 --> 00:17:28,870
continuation because it's not like
okay we are building digital worlds but

1030
00:17:28,870 --> 00:17:28,880
okay we are building digital worlds but
 

1031
00:17:28,880 --> 00:17:30,070
okay we are building digital worlds but
we don't have that today i think you

1032
00:17:30,070 --> 00:17:30,080
we don't have that today i think you
 

1033
00:17:30,080 --> 00:17:30,710
we don't have that today i think you
know

1034
00:17:30,710 --> 00:17:30,720
know
 

1035
00:17:30,720 --> 00:17:32,150
know
you know you and i probably already live

1036
00:17:32,150 --> 00:17:32,160
you know you and i probably already live
 

1037
00:17:32,160 --> 00:17:34,070
you know you and i probably already live
a very large part of our life in digital

1038
00:17:34,070 --> 00:17:34,080
a very large part of our life in digital
 

1039
00:17:34,080 --> 00:17:36,230
a very large part of our life in digital
worlds they're just not 3d immersive

1040
00:17:36,230 --> 00:17:36,240
worlds they're just not 3d immersive
 

1041
00:17:36,240 --> 00:17:37,990
worlds they're just not 3d immersive
virtual reality but you know i do a lot

1042
00:17:37,990 --> 00:17:38,000
virtual reality but you know i do a lot
 

1043
00:17:38,000 --> 00:17:40,630
virtual reality but you know i do a lot
of meetings over video or and i spend a

1044
00:17:40,630 --> 00:17:40,640
of meetings over video or and i spend a
 

1045
00:17:40,640 --> 00:17:42,230
of meetings over video or and i spend a
lot of time writing things over email or

1046
00:17:42,230 --> 00:17:42,240
lot of time writing things over email or
 

1047
00:17:42,240 --> 00:17:44,870
lot of time writing things over email or
whatsapp or or whatever so what is it

1048
00:17:44,870 --> 00:17:44,880
whatsapp or or whatever so what is it
 

1049
00:17:44,880 --> 00:17:46,789
whatsapp or or whatever so what is it
going to take to get there for kind of

1050
00:17:46,789 --> 00:17:46,799
going to take to get there for kind of
 

1051
00:17:46,799 --> 00:17:48,470
going to take to get there for kind of
the immersive presence version of this

1052
00:17:48,470 --> 00:17:48,480
the immersive presence version of this
 

1053
00:17:48,480 --> 00:17:50,789
the immersive presence version of this
which i think is what you're asking um

1054
00:17:50,789 --> 00:17:50,799
which i think is what you're asking um
 

1055
00:17:50,799 --> 00:17:52,470
which i think is what you're asking um
and for that i think that there's just a

1056
00:17:52,470 --> 00:17:52,480
and for that i think that there's just a
 

1057
00:17:52,480 --> 00:17:55,430
and for that i think that there's just a
bunch of different use cases right and

1058
00:17:55,430 --> 00:17:55,440
bunch of different use cases right and
 

1059
00:17:55,440 --> 00:17:57,669
bunch of different use cases right and
and um

1060
00:17:57,669 --> 00:17:57,679
and um
 

1061
00:17:57,679 --> 00:17:59,669
and um
i think when you're when you're building

1062
00:17:59,669 --> 00:17:59,679
i think when you're when you're building
 

1063
00:17:59,679 --> 00:18:01,669
i think when you're when you're building
technology i think

1064
00:18:01,669 --> 00:18:01,679
technology i think
 

1065
00:18:01,679 --> 00:18:02,789
technology i think
you're

1066
00:18:02,789 --> 00:18:02,799
you're
 

1067
00:18:02,799 --> 00:18:05,029
you're
a lot of it is just you're managing this

1068
00:18:05,029 --> 00:18:05,039
a lot of it is just you're managing this
 

1069
00:18:05,039 --> 00:18:07,110
a lot of it is just you're managing this
duality where on the one hand you want

1070
00:18:07,110 --> 00:18:07,120
duality where on the one hand you want
 

1071
00:18:07,120 --> 00:18:09,430
duality where on the one hand you want
to build these elegant things that can

1072
00:18:09,430 --> 00:18:09,440
to build these elegant things that can
 

1073
00:18:09,440 --> 00:18:11,270
to build these elegant things that can
scale and you know have billions of

1074
00:18:11,270 --> 00:18:11,280
scale and you know have billions of
 

1075
00:18:11,280 --> 00:18:13,110
scale and you know have billions of
people use them and get value from them

1076
00:18:13,110 --> 00:18:13,120
people use them and get value from them
 

1077
00:18:13,120 --> 00:18:14,390
people use them and get value from them
and then on the other hand

1078
00:18:14,390 --> 00:18:14,400
and then on the other hand
 

1079
00:18:14,400 --> 00:18:16,870
and then on the other hand
you're fighting this kind of ground game

1080
00:18:16,870 --> 00:18:16,880
you're fighting this kind of ground game
 

1081
00:18:16,880 --> 00:18:18,549
you're fighting this kind of ground game
where it's just there are just a lot of

1082
00:18:18,549 --> 00:18:18,559
where it's just there are just a lot of
 

1083
00:18:18,559 --> 00:18:19,990
where it's just there are just a lot of
different use cases and people do

1084
00:18:19,990 --> 00:18:20,000
different use cases and people do
 

1085
00:18:20,000 --> 00:18:21,350
different use cases and people do
different things and like you want to be

1086
00:18:21,350 --> 00:18:21,360
different things and like you want to be
 

1087
00:18:21,360 --> 00:18:23,350
different things and like you want to be
able to unlock them so the first ones

1088
00:18:23,350 --> 00:18:23,360
able to unlock them so the first ones
 

1089
00:18:23,360 --> 00:18:25,750
able to unlock them so the first ones
that we basically went after

1090
00:18:25,750 --> 00:18:25,760
that we basically went after
 

1091
00:18:25,760 --> 00:18:27,270
that we basically went after
were gaming

1092
00:18:27,270 --> 00:18:27,280
were gaming
 

1093
00:18:27,280 --> 00:18:28,470
were gaming
with quest

1094
00:18:28,470 --> 00:18:28,480
with quest
 

1095
00:18:28,480 --> 00:18:30,870
with quest
and social experiences and this is you

1096
00:18:30,870 --> 00:18:30,880
and social experiences and this is you
 

1097
00:18:30,880 --> 00:18:32,150
and social experiences and this is you
know it goes back to when we started

1098
00:18:32,150 --> 00:18:32,160
know it goes back to when we started
 

1099
00:18:32,160 --> 00:18:34,070
know it goes back to when we started
working on virtual reality my theory at

1100
00:18:34,070 --> 00:18:34,080
working on virtual reality my theory at
 

1101
00:18:34,080 --> 00:18:37,270
working on virtual reality my theory at
the time was basically

1102
00:18:37,270 --> 00:18:37,280
the time was basically
 

1103
00:18:37,280 --> 00:18:39,350
the time was basically
people thought about it as gaming

1104
00:18:39,350 --> 00:18:39,360
people thought about it as gaming
 

1105
00:18:39,360 --> 00:18:40,710
people thought about it as gaming
but

1106
00:18:40,710 --> 00:18:40,720
but
 

1107
00:18:40,720 --> 00:18:42,870
but
if you look at all computing platforms

1108
00:18:42,870 --> 00:18:42,880
if you look at all computing platforms
 

1109
00:18:42,880 --> 00:18:45,430
if you look at all computing platforms
up to that point um you know gaming is a

1110
00:18:45,430 --> 00:18:45,440
up to that point um you know gaming is a
 

1111
00:18:45,440 --> 00:18:47,270
up to that point um you know gaming is a
huge part it was a huge part of pcs it

1112
00:18:47,270 --> 00:18:47,280
huge part it was a huge part of pcs it
 

1113
00:18:47,280 --> 00:18:49,270
huge part it was a huge part of pcs it
was a huge part of mobile

1114
00:18:49,270 --> 00:18:49,280
was a huge part of mobile
 

1115
00:18:49,280 --> 00:18:50,710
was a huge part of mobile
but it was also very

1116
00:18:50,710 --> 00:18:50,720
but it was also very
 

1117
00:18:50,720 --> 00:18:52,710
but it was also very
decentralized right there wasn't you

1118
00:18:52,710 --> 00:18:52,720
decentralized right there wasn't you
 

1119
00:18:52,720 --> 00:18:54,390
decentralized right there wasn't you
know for the most part you know one or

1120
00:18:54,390 --> 00:18:54,400
know for the most part you know one or
 

1121
00:18:54,400 --> 00:18:56,630
know for the most part you know one or
two gaming companies there were a lot of

1122
00:18:56,630 --> 00:18:56,640
two gaming companies there were a lot of
 

1123
00:18:56,640 --> 00:18:57,990
two gaming companies there were a lot of
gaming companies and gaming is somewhat

1124
00:18:57,990 --> 00:18:58,000
gaming companies and gaming is somewhat
 

1125
00:18:58,000 --> 00:18:59,510
gaming companies and gaming is somewhat
hits based i mean we're getting some

1126
00:18:59,510 --> 00:18:59,520
hits based i mean we're getting some
 

1127
00:18:59,520 --> 00:19:01,350
hits based i mean we're getting some
games that are that have more longevity

1128
00:19:01,350 --> 00:19:01,360
games that are that have more longevity
 

1129
00:19:01,360 --> 00:19:03,830
games that are that have more longevity
but um but but in general you know there

1130
00:19:03,830 --> 00:19:03,840
but um but but in general you know there

i mean i took that seriously i thought
 

1295
00:21:29,679 --> 00:21:32,470
i mean i took that seriously i thought
that was a that was a real uh

1296
00:21:32,470 --> 00:21:32,480
that was a that was a real uh
 

1297
00:21:32,480 --> 00:21:33,350
that was a that was a real uh
uh

1298
00:21:33,350 --> 00:21:33,360
uh
 

1299
00:21:33,360 --> 00:21:35,909
uh
suggestion that would be an amazing

1300
00:21:35,909 --> 00:21:35,919
suggestion that would be an amazing
 

1301
00:21:35,919 --> 00:21:37,350
suggestion that would be an amazing
chance if we ever step on the mat

1302
00:21:37,350 --> 00:21:37,360
chance if we ever step on the mat
 

1303
00:21:37,360 --> 00:21:39,029
chance if we ever step on the mat
together and just like roll around i'll

1304
00:21:39,029 --> 00:21:39,039
together and just like roll around i'll
 

1305
00:21:39,039 --> 00:21:40,710
together and just like roll around i'll
show you some moves well give me a year

1306
00:21:40,710 --> 00:21:40,720
show you some moves well give me a year
 

1307
00:21:40,720 --> 00:21:43,270
show you some moves well give me a year
to train and and then and then is like

1308
00:21:43,270 --> 00:21:43,280
to train and and then and then is like
 

1309
00:21:43,280 --> 00:21:44,789
to train and and then and then is like
rock you know you've seen rocky iv where

1310
00:21:44,789 --> 00:21:44,799
rock you know you've seen rocky iv where
 

1311
00:21:44,799 --> 00:21:46,390
rock you know you've seen rocky iv where
the russian faces off the america i'm

1312
00:21:46,390 --> 00:21:46,400
the russian faces off the america i'm
 

1313
00:21:46,400 --> 00:21:48,310
the russian faces off the america i'm
the russian in this picture and then you

1314
00:21:48,310 --> 00:21:48,320
the russian in this picture and then you
 

1315
00:21:48,320 --> 00:21:50,310
the russian in this picture and then you
you're the rocky the underdog that gets

1316
00:21:50,310 --> 00:21:50,320
you're the rocky the underdog that gets
 

1317
00:21:50,320 --> 00:21:53,669
you're the rocky the underdog that gets
to to win the idea of me as rocky

1318
00:21:53,669 --> 00:21:53,679
to to win the idea of me as rocky
 

1319
00:21:53,679 --> 00:21:56,070
to to win the idea of me as rocky
and like fighting is um

1320
00:21:56,070 --> 00:21:56,080
and like fighting is um
 

1321
00:21:56,080 --> 00:22:00,630
and like fighting is um
if he dies he dies

1322
00:22:00,630 --> 00:22:00,640

 

1323
00:22:00,640 --> 00:22:03,830

i mean anyway yeah but i mean a lot of

1324
00:22:03,830 --> 00:22:03,840
i mean anyway yeah but i mean a lot of
 

1325
00:22:03,840 --> 00:22:05,750
i mean anyway yeah but i mean a lot of
aspects of fitness

1326
00:22:05,750 --> 00:22:05,760
aspects of fitness
 

1327
00:22:05,760 --> 00:22:07,190
aspects of fitness
you know i don't know if you've

1328
00:22:07,190 --> 00:22:07,200
you know i don't know if you've
 

1329
00:22:07,200 --> 00:22:10,070
you know i don't know if you've
if you've tried supernatural on quest or

1330
00:22:10,070 --> 00:22:10,080
if you've tried supernatural on quest or
 

1331
00:22:10,080 --> 00:22:11,590
if you've tried supernatural on quest or
so first of all can i just comment on

1332
00:22:11,590 --> 00:22:11,600
so first of all can i just comment on
 

1333
00:22:11,600 --> 00:22:13,510
so first of all can i just comment on
the fact every time i played around with

1334
00:22:13,510 --> 00:22:13,520
the fact every time i played around with
 

1335
00:22:13,520 --> 00:22:14,870
the fact every time i played around with
quest two

1336
00:22:14,870 --> 00:22:14,880
quest two
 

1337
00:22:14,880 --> 00:22:17,350
quest two
i i just i get giddy every time i step

1338
00:22:17,350 --> 00:22:17,360
i i just i get giddy every time i step
 

1339
00:22:17,360 --> 00:22:19,110
i i just i get giddy every time i step
into virtual reality so you mentioned

1340
00:22:19,110 --> 00:22:19,120
into virtual reality so you mentioned
 

1341
00:22:19,120 --> 00:22:20,789
into virtual reality so you mentioned
productivity all those kinds of things

1342
00:22:20,789 --> 00:22:20,799
productivity all those kinds of things
 

1343
00:22:20,799 --> 00:22:22,470
productivity all those kinds of things
that's definitely

1344
00:22:22,470 --> 00:22:22,480
that's definitely
 

1345
00:22:22,480 --> 00:22:24,390
that's definitely
something i'm excited about but really i

1346
00:22:24,390 --> 00:22:24,400
something i'm excited about but really i
 

1347
00:22:24,400 --> 00:22:25,590
something i'm excited about but really i
just love

1348
00:22:25,590 --> 00:22:25,600
just love
 

1349
00:22:25,600 --> 00:22:27,430
just love
the possibilities of stepping into that

1350
00:22:27,430 --> 00:22:27,440
the possibilities of stepping into that
 

1351
00:22:27,440 --> 00:22:29,190
the possibilities of stepping into that
world it's it's uh maybe it's the

1352
00:22:29,190 --> 00:22:29,200
world it's it's uh maybe it's the
 

1353
00:22:29,200 --> 00:22:32,070
world it's it's uh maybe it's the
introvert in me but it just feels like

1354
00:22:32,070 --> 00:22:32,080
introvert in me but it just feels like
 

1355
00:22:32,080 --> 00:22:36,070
introvert in me but it just feels like
the most convenient way to travel

1356
00:22:36,070 --> 00:22:36,080
the most convenient way to travel
 

1357
00:22:36,080 --> 00:22:39,270
the most convenient way to travel
into worlds into worlds that are similar

1358
00:22:39,270 --> 00:22:39,280
into worlds into worlds that are similar
 

1359
00:22:39,280 --> 00:22:41,430
into worlds into worlds that are similar
to the real world or totally different

1360
00:22:41,430 --> 00:22:41,440
to the real world or totally different
 

1361
00:22:41,440 --> 00:22:43,190
to the real world or totally different
it's like alice in wonderland just try

1362
00:22:43,190 --> 00:22:43,200
it's like alice in wonderland just try
 

1363
00:22:43,200 --> 00:22:45,350
it's like alice in wonderland just try
out crazy stuff the possibilities are

1364
00:22:45,350 --> 00:22:45,360
out crazy stuff the possibilities are
 

1365
00:22:45,360 --> 00:22:47,750
out crazy stuff the possibilities are
endless and i just i personally

1366
00:22:47,750 --> 00:22:47,760
endless and i just i personally
 

1367
00:22:47,760 --> 00:22:49,909
endless and i just i personally
am just

love
 

1371
00:22:50,799 --> 00:22:52,870
love
get excited for uh stepping in those

1372
00:22:52,870 --> 00:22:52,880
get excited for uh stepping in those
 

1373
00:22:52,880 --> 00:22:55,029
get excited for uh stepping in those
virtual worlds i'm so i'm a huge fan in

1374
00:22:55,029 --> 00:22:55,039
virtual worlds i'm so i'm a huge fan in
 

1375
00:22:55,039 --> 00:22:56,630
virtual worlds i'm so i'm a huge fan in
terms of the uh

1376
00:22:56,630 --> 00:22:56,640
terms of the uh
 

1377
00:22:56,640 --> 00:22:58,390
terms of the uh
the productivity as a program i spent

1378
00:22:58,390 --> 00:22:58,400
the productivity as a program i spent
 

1379
00:22:58,400 --> 00:23:00,630
the productivity as a program i spent
most of my day programming that's that's

1380
00:23:00,630 --> 00:23:00,640
most of my day programming that's that's
 

1381
00:23:00,640 --> 00:23:02,230
most of my day programming that's that's
really interesting also but then you

1382
00:23:02,230 --> 00:23:02,240
really interesting also but then you
 

1383
00:23:02,240 --> 00:23:04,390
really interesting also but then you
have to develop the right ids you have

1384
00:23:04,390 --> 00:23:04,400
have to develop the right ids you have
 

1385
00:23:04,400 --> 00:23:06,630
have to develop the right ids you have
to develop yeah like the there has to be

1386
00:23:06,630 --> 00:23:06,640
to develop yeah like the there has to be
 

1387
00:23:06,640 --> 00:23:08,390
to develop yeah like the there has to be
a threshold where a large amount of the

1388
00:23:08,390 --> 00:23:08,400
a threshold where a large amount of the
 

1389
00:23:08,400 --> 00:23:10,470
a threshold where a large amount of the
programming community moves there but

1390
00:23:10,470 --> 00:23:10,480
programming community moves there but
 

1391
00:23:10,480 --> 00:23:11,990
programming community moves there but
the collaborative aspects that are

1392
00:23:11,990 --> 00:23:12,000
the collaborative aspects that are
 

1393
00:23:12,000 --> 00:23:14,470
the collaborative aspects that are
possible in terms of meetings in terms

1394
00:23:14,470 --> 00:23:14,480
possible in terms of meetings in terms
 

1395
00:23:14,480 --> 00:23:15,750
possible in terms of meetings in terms
of the uh

1396
00:23:15,750 --> 00:23:15,760
of the uh
 

1397
00:23:15,760 --> 00:23:17,110
of the uh
when when two coders are working

1398
00:23:17,110 --> 00:23:17,120
when when two coders are working
 

1399
00:23:17,120 --> 00:23:18,390
when when two coders are working
together

1400
00:23:18,390 --> 00:23:18,400
together
 

1401
00:23:18,400 --> 00:23:19,990
together
i mean that the possibilities they're

1402
00:23:19,990 --> 00:23:20,000
i mean that the possibilities they're
 

1403
00:23:20,000 --> 00:23:21,669
i mean that the possibilities they're
super super exciting

1404
00:23:21,669 --> 00:23:21,679
super super exciting
 

1405
00:23:21,679 --> 00:23:22,789
super super exciting
i think that

1406
00:23:22,789 --> 00:23:22,799
i think that
 

1407
00:23:22,799 --> 00:23:24,149
i think that
in building this

1408
00:23:24,149 --> 00:23:24,159
in building this
 

1409
00:23:24,159 --> 00:23:26,950
in building this
we sort of need to balance

1410
00:23:26,950 --> 00:23:26,960
we sort of need to balance
 

1411
00:23:26,960 --> 00:23:27,990
we sort of need to balance
there are going to be some new things

1412
00:23:27,990 --> 00:23:28,000
there are going to be some new things
 

1413
00:23:28,000 --> 00:23:29,669
there are going to be some new things
that you just couldn't do before and

1414
00:23:29,669 --> 00:23:29,679
that you just couldn't do before and
 

1415
00:23:29,679 --> 00:23:30,870
that you just couldn't do before and
those are going to be the amazing

1416
00:23:30,870 --> 00:23:30,880
those are going to be the amazing
 

1417
00:23:30,880 --> 00:23:33,029
those are going to be the amazing
experiences so teleporting to any place

1418
00:23:33,029 --> 00:23:33,039
experiences so teleporting to any place
 

1419
00:23:33,039 --> 00:23:35,510
experiences so teleporting to any place
right whether it's a real place or

1420
00:23:35,510 --> 00:23:35,520
right whether it's a real place or
 

1421
00:23:35,520 --> 00:23:38,310
right whether it's a real place or
something that people made

1422
00:23:38,310 --> 00:23:38,320
something that people made
 

1423
00:23:38,320 --> 00:23:40,390
something that people made
i mean some of the experiences around

1424
00:23:40,390 --> 00:23:40,400
i mean some of the experiences around
 

1425
00:23:40,400 --> 00:23:42,390
i mean some of the experiences around
how we can build stuff in new ways where

1426
00:23:42,390 --> 00:23:42,400
how we can build stuff in new ways where
 

1427
00:23:42,400 --> 00:23:43,350
how we can build stuff in new ways where
you know

1428
00:23:43,350 --> 00:23:43,360
you know
 

1429
00:23:43,360 --> 00:23:44,789
you know
a lot of the stuff that you know when

1430
00:23:44,789 --> 00:23:44,799
a lot of the stuff that you know when
 

1431
00:23:44,799 --> 00:23:46,070
a lot of the stuff that you know when
i'm coding stuff it's like alright you

1432
00:23:46,070 --> 00:23:46,080
i'm coding stuff it's like alright you
 

1433
00:23:46,080 --> 00:23:47,190
i'm coding stuff it's like alright you
code it and then you build it and then

1434
00:23:47,190 --> 00:23:47,200
code it and then you build it and then
 

1435
00:23:47,200 --> 00:23:49,190
code it and then you build it and then
you see it afterwards but increasingly

1436
00:23:49,190 --> 00:23:49,200
you see it afterwards but increasingly
 

1437
00:23:49,200 --> 00:23:50,390
you see it afterwards but increasingly
it's going to be possible to you know

1438
00:23:50,390 --> 00:23:50,400
it's going to be possible to you know
 

1439
00:23:50,400 --> 00:23:51,990
it's going to be possible to you know
you're in a world and you're building

1440
00:23:51,990 --> 00:23:52,000
you're in a world and you're building
 

1441
00:23:52,000 --> 00:23:54,230
you're in a world and you're building

progress is this builder bot program
where now you are you can just talk to

1454
00:24:06,630 --> 00:24:06,640
where now you are you can just talk to
 

1455
00:24:06,640 --> 00:24:08,310
where now you are you can just talk to
it and say hey okay i'm in this world

1456
00:24:08,310 --> 00:24:08,320
it and say hey okay i'm in this world
 

1457
00:24:08,320 --> 00:24:09,990
it and say hey okay i'm in this world
like put put some trees over there and

1458
00:24:09,990 --> 00:24:10,000
like put put some trees over there and
 

1459
00:24:10,000 --> 00:24:11,750
like put put some trees over there and
it'll do that and like all right put put

1460
00:24:11,750 --> 00:24:11,760
it'll do that and like all right put put
 

1461
00:24:11,760 --> 00:24:14,870
it'll do that and like all right put put
some bottles of water on um you know on

1462
00:24:14,870 --> 00:24:14,880
some bottles of water on um you know on
 

1463
00:24:14,880 --> 00:24:16,870
some bottles of water on um you know on
on our picnic blanket and it'll do that

1464
00:24:16,870 --> 00:24:16,880
on our picnic blanket and it'll do that
 

1465
00:24:16,880 --> 00:24:18,230
on our picnic blanket and it'll do that
and you're in the world and it's i think

1466
00:24:18,230 --> 00:24:18,240
and you're in the world and it's i think
 

1467
00:24:18,240 --> 00:24:19,430
and you're in the world and it's i think
they're going to be new paradigms for

1468
00:24:19,430 --> 00:24:19,440
they're going to be new paradigms for
 

1469
00:24:19,440 --> 00:24:21,029
they're going to be new paradigms for
coding so yeah there are going to be

1470
00:24:21,029 --> 00:24:21,039
coding so yeah there are going to be
 

1471
00:24:21,039 --> 00:24:23,750
coding so yeah there are going to be
some things that i think are just

1472
00:24:23,750 --> 00:24:23,760
some things that i think are just
 

1473
00:24:23,760 --> 00:24:25,430
some things that i think are just
pretty amazing especially the first few

1474
00:24:25,430 --> 00:24:25,440
pretty amazing especially the first few
 

1475
00:24:25,440 --> 00:24:27,669
pretty amazing especially the first few
times that you do them that you're like

1476
00:24:27,669 --> 00:24:27,679
times that you do them that you're like
 

1477
00:24:27,679 --> 00:24:29,510
times that you do them that you're like
whoa like i've never had an experience

1478
00:24:29,510 --> 00:24:29,520
whoa like i've never had an experience
 

1479
00:24:29,520 --> 00:24:30,549
whoa like i've never had an experience
like this

1480
00:24:30,549 --> 00:24:30,559
like this
 

1481
00:24:30,559 --> 00:24:31,430
like this
but

1482
00:24:31,430 --> 00:24:31,440
but
 

1483
00:24:31,440 --> 00:24:33,269
but
most of your life

1484
00:24:33,269 --> 00:24:33,279
most of your life
 

1485
00:24:33,279 --> 00:24:35,909
most of your life
i would imagine is not doing things that

1486
00:24:35,909 --> 00:24:35,919
i would imagine is not doing things that
 

1487
00:24:35,919 --> 00:24:38,310
i would imagine is not doing things that
are amazing for the first time um a lot

1488
00:24:38,310 --> 00:24:38,320
are amazing for the first time um a lot
 

1489
00:24:38,320 --> 00:24:39,909
are amazing for the first time um a lot
of this in terms of i mean just

1490
00:24:39,909 --> 00:24:39,919
of this in terms of i mean just
 

1491
00:24:39,919 --> 00:24:41,190
of this in terms of i mean just
answering your question from before

1492
00:24:41,190 --> 00:24:41,200
answering your question from before
 

1493
00:24:41,200 --> 00:24:42,870
answering your question from before
around what is it going to take before

1494
00:24:42,870 --> 00:24:42,880
around what is it going to take before
 

1495
00:24:42,880 --> 00:24:44,230
around what is it going to take before
you're spending most of your time in

1496
00:24:44,230 --> 00:24:44,240
you're spending most of your time in
 

1497
00:24:44,240 --> 00:24:46,870
you're spending most of your time in
this well first of all

1498
00:24:46,870 --> 00:24:46,880
this well first of all
 

1499
00:24:46,880 --> 00:24:48,390
this well first of all
let me just say it as an aside the goal

1500
00:24:48,390 --> 00:24:48,400
let me just say it as an aside the goal
 

1501
00:24:48,400 --> 00:24:49,909
let me just say it as an aside the goal
isn't to have people spend a lot more

1502
00:24:49,909 --> 00:24:49,919
isn't to have people spend a lot more
 

1503
00:24:49,919 --> 00:24:52,630
isn't to have people spend a lot more
time in computing i'm asking myself when

1504
00:24:52,630 --> 00:24:52,640
time in computing i'm asking myself when
 

1505
00:24:52,640 --> 00:24:54,549
time in computing i'm asking myself when
will i spend all of my time in it's to

1506
00:24:54,549 --> 00:24:54,559
will i spend all of my time in it's to
 

1507
00:24:54,559 --> 00:24:56,230
will i spend all of my time in it's to
make yeah it's to make computing more

1508
00:24:56,230 --> 00:24:56,240
make yeah it's to make computing more
 

1509
00:24:56,240 --> 00:24:58,630
make yeah it's to make computing more
more natural but yes um

1510
00:24:58,630 --> 00:24:58,640
more natural but yes um
 

1511
00:24:58,640 --> 00:25:00,630
more natural but yes um
but i think it'll you will you will

1512
00:25:00,630 --> 00:25:00,640
but i think it'll you will you will
 

1513
00:25:00,640 --> 00:25:02,630
but i think it'll you will you will
spend more most of your computing time

1514
00:25:02,630 --> 00:25:02,640
spend more most of your computing time
 

1515
00:25:02,640 --> 00:25:03,590
spend more most of your computing time
in this

1516
00:25:03,590 --> 00:25:03,600
in this
 

1517
00:25:03,600 --> 00:25:05,430
in this
when it does the things that you use

1518
00:25:05,430 --> 00:25:05,440
when it does the things that you use
 

1519
00:25:05,440 --> 00:25:07,750
when it does the things that you use
computing for somewhat better so you

1520
00:25:07,750 --> 00:25:07,760
computing for somewhat better so you
 

1521
00:25:07,760 --> 00:25:09,669
computing for somewhat better so you
know maybe um having your perfect

1522
00:25:09,669 --> 00:25:09,679
know maybe um having your perfect
 

1523
00:25:09,679 --> 00:25:11,590
know maybe um having your perfect
workstation is a

1524
00:25:11,590 --> 00:25:11,600
workstation is a
 

1525
00:25:11,600 --> 00:25:13,750
workstation is a
five percent improvement on your coding

1526
00:25:13,750 --> 00:25:13,760
five percent improvement on your coding
 

1527
00:25:13,760 --> 00:25:16,070
five percent improvement on your coding
productivity it maybe it's not like a

1528
00:25:16,070 --> 00:25:16,080
productivity it maybe it's not like a
 

1529
00:25:16,080 --> 00:25:19,269
productivity it maybe it's not like a
you know completely new new thing um but

1530
00:25:19,269 --> 00:25:19,279
you know completely new new thing um but
 

1531
00:25:19,279 --> 00:25:20,950
you know completely new new thing um but
i mean look if if i could increase the

1532
00:25:20,950 --> 00:25:20,960
i mean look if if i could increase the
 

1533
00:25:20,960 --> 00:25:22,789
i mean look if if i could increase the
productivity of every engineer in meta

1534
00:25:22,789 --> 00:25:22,799
productivity of every engineer in meta
 

1535
00:25:22,799 --> 00:25:24,870
productivity of every engineer in meta
by five percent um

1536
00:25:24,870 --> 00:25:24,880
by five percent um
 

1537
00:25:24,880 --> 00:25:26,789
by five percent um
you know we'd buy those devices for

1538
00:25:26,789 --> 00:25:26,799
you know we'd buy those devices for
 

1539
00:25:26,799 --> 00:25:29,190
you know we'd buy those devices for
everyone and i i imagine you know a lot

1540
00:25:29,190 --> 00:25:29,200
everyone and i i imagine you know a lot
 

1541
00:25:29,200 --> 00:25:30,470
everyone and i i imagine you know a lot
of other companies would too and that's

1542
00:25:30,470 --> 00:25:30,480
of other companies would too and that's
 

1543
00:25:30,480 --> 00:25:32,310
of other companies would too and that's
how you start getting to the scale that

1544
00:25:32,310 --> 00:25:32,320
how you start getting to the scale that
 

1545
00:25:32,320 --> 00:25:33,990
how you start getting to the scale that
um that i think you know makes this

1546
00:25:33,990 --> 00:25:34,000
um that i think you know makes this
 

1547
00:25:34,000 --> 00:25:35,350
um that i think you know makes this
rival some of the bigger computing

1548
00:25:35,350 --> 00:25:35,360
rival some of the bigger computing
 

1549
00:25:35,360 --> 00:25:37,190
rival some of the bigger computing
platforms that exist today let me ask

1550
00:25:37,190 --> 00:25:37,200
platforms that exist today let me ask
 

1551
00:25:37,200 --> 00:25:38,870
platforms that exist today let me ask
you about identity we talked about the

1552
00:25:38,870 --> 00:25:38,880
you about identity we talked about the
 

1553
00:25:38,880 --> 00:25:40,310
you about identity we talked about the
avatar

1554
00:25:40,310 --> 00:25:40,320
avatar
 

1555
00:25:40,320 --> 00:25:42,549
avatar
how do you see identity in the metaverse

1556
00:25:42,549 --> 00:25:42,559
how do you see identity in the metaverse
 

1557
00:25:42,559 --> 00:25:45,110
how do you see identity in the metaverse
should the avatar be tied to your

1558
00:25:45,110 --> 00:25:45,120
should the avatar be tied to your
 

1559
00:25:45,120 --> 00:25:46,230
should the avatar be tied to your
identity

1560
00:25:46,230 --> 00:25:46,240
identity
 

1561
00:25:46,240 --> 00:25:47,430
identity
or can it be

1562
00:25:47,430 --> 00:25:47,440
or can it be
 

1563
00:25:47,440 --> 00:25:49,269
or can it be
can i be anything in the metaverse like

1564
00:25:49,269 --> 00:25:49,279
can i be anything in the metaverse like
 

1565
00:25:49,279 --> 00:25:50,310
can i be anything in the metaverse like
can i

1566
00:25:50,310 --> 00:25:50,320
can i
 

1567
00:25:50,320 --> 00:25:52,549
can i
be whatever the heck i want can i even

1568
00:25:52,549 --> 00:25:52,559
be whatever the heck i want can i even
 

1569
00:25:52,559 --> 00:25:54,630
be whatever the heck i want can i even
be a troll so there's there's a there's

1570
00:25:54,630 --> 00:25:54,640
be a troll so there's there's a there's
 

1571
00:25:54,640 --> 00:25:57,350
be a troll so there's there's a there's
a exciting freeing possibilities and

1572
00:25:57,350 --> 00:25:57,360
a exciting freeing possibilities and
 

1573
00:25:57,360 --> 00:26:00,549
a exciting freeing possibilities and
there's the darker possibilities too

1574
00:26:00,549 --> 00:26:00,559
there's the darker possibilities too
 

1575
00:26:00,559 --> 00:26:01,830
there's the darker possibilities too
yeah i mean i think that there's going

1576
00:26:01,830 --> 00:26:01,840
yeah i mean i think that there's going
 

1577
00:26:01,840 --> 00:26:03,990
yeah i mean i think that there's going
to be a range right so

1578
00:26:03,990 --> 00:26:04,000
to be a range right so
 

1579
00:26:04,000 --> 00:26:05,750
to be a range right so
we're working on

1580
00:26:05,750 --> 00:26:05,760
we're working on
 

1581
00:26:05,760 --> 00:26:08,830
we're working on
for expression and avatars

1582
00:26:08,830 --> 00:26:08,840
for expression and avatars
 

1583
00:26:08,840 --> 00:26:11,590
for expression and avatars
um on one end of the spectrum are kind

1584
00:26:11,590 --> 00:26:11,600
um on one end of the spectrum are kind
 

1585
00:26:11,600 --> 00:26:14,870
um on one end of the spectrum are kind
of expressive and cartoonish avatars and

1586
00:26:14,870 --> 00:26:14,880
of expressive and cartoonish avatars and
 

1587
00:26:14,880 --> 00:26:16,390
of expressive and cartoonish avatars and
then on the other end of the spectrum

1588
00:26:16,390 --> 00:26:16,400
then on the other end of the spectrum
 

1589
00:26:16,400 --> 00:26:19,510
then on the other end of the spectrum
are photorealistic avatars and i just

1590
00:26:19,510 --> 00:26:19,520
are photorealistic avatars and i just
 

1591
00:26:19,520 --> 00:26:20,870
are photorealistic avatars and i just
think the reality is that they're going

1592
00:26:20,870 --> 00:26:20,880
think the reality is that they're going
 

1593
00:26:20,880 --> 00:26:22,470
think the reality is that they're going
to be different use cases for different

1594
00:26:22,470 --> 00:26:22,480
to be different use cases for different
 

1595
00:26:22,480 --> 00:26:24,390
to be different use cases for different
things um and i guess there's another

1596
00:26:24,390 --> 00:26:24,400
things um and i guess there's another
 

1597
00:26:24,400 --> 00:26:26,789
things um and i guess there's another
axis so if you're going from

1598
00:26:26,789 --> 00:26:26,799
axis so if you're going from
 

1599
00:26:26,799 --> 00:26:28,870
axis so if you're going from
photorealistic to expressive there's

1600
00:26:28,870 --> 00:26:28,880
photorealistic to expressive there's
 

1601
00:26:28,880 --> 00:26:31,029
photorealistic to expressive there's
also like representing you directly

1602
00:26:31,029 --> 00:26:31,039
also like representing you directly
 

1603
00:26:31,039 --> 00:26:33,830
also like representing you directly
versus like some fantasy identity and i

1604
00:26:33,830 --> 00:26:33,840
versus like some fantasy identity and i
 

1605
00:26:33,840 --> 00:26:35,269
versus like some fantasy identity and i
think that there are going to be things

1606
00:26:35,269 --> 00:26:35,279
think that there are going to be things
 

1607
00:26:35,279 --> 00:26:37,510
think that there are going to be things
on on all ends of that spectrum too

1608
00:26:37,510 --> 00:26:37,520
on on all ends of that spectrum too
 

1609
00:26:37,520 --> 00:26:40,230
on on all ends of that spectrum too

translate that into a more expressive

1768
00:29:07,110 --> 00:29:07,120
translate that into a more expressive
 

1769
00:29:07,120 --> 00:29:07,909
translate that into a more expressive
thing

1770
00:29:07,909 --> 00:29:07,919
thing
 

1771
00:29:07,919 --> 00:29:09,909
thing
for your kind of cartoonish or

1772
00:29:09,909 --> 00:29:09,919
for your kind of cartoonish or
 

1773
00:29:09,919 --> 00:29:11,750
for your kind of cartoonish or
expressive avatar and there are multiple

1774
00:29:11,750 --> 00:29:11,760
expressive avatar and there are multiple
 

1775
00:29:11,760 --> 00:29:13,269
expressive avatar and there are multiple
ways to do that you can view them as two

1776
00:29:13,269 --> 00:29:13,279
ways to do that you can view them as two
 

1777
00:29:13,279 --> 00:29:15,750
ways to do that you can view them as two
discrete points and okay maybe you know

1778
00:29:15,750 --> 00:29:15,760
discrete points and okay maybe you know
 

1779
00:29:15,760 --> 00:29:17,190
discrete points and okay maybe you know
if a designer

1780
00:29:17,190 --> 00:29:17,200
if a designer
 

1781
00:29:17,200 --> 00:29:18,789
if a designer
sells one thing then it actually comes

1782
00:29:18,789 --> 00:29:18,799
sells one thing then it actually comes
 

1783
00:29:18,799 --> 00:29:20,149
sells one thing then it actually comes
in a pack and there's two and you can

1784
00:29:20,149 --> 00:29:20,159
in a pack and there's two and you can
 

1785
00:29:20,159 --> 00:29:22,870
in a pack and there's two and you can
use um either one on that but but i

1786
00:29:22,870 --> 00:29:22,880
use um either one on that but but i
 

1787
00:29:22,880 --> 00:29:24,149
use um either one on that but but i
actually think this stuff might exist

1788
00:29:24,149 --> 00:29:24,159
actually think this stuff might exist
 

1789
00:29:24,159 --> 00:29:26,630
actually think this stuff might exist
more as a spectrum in the future and

1790
00:29:26,630 --> 00:29:26,640
more as a spectrum in the future and
 

1791
00:29:26,640 --> 00:29:28,070
more as a spectrum in the future and
that's what

1792
00:29:28,070 --> 00:29:28,080
that's what
 

1793
00:29:28,080 --> 00:29:31,269
that's what
i do think the direction on some of the

1794
00:29:31,269 --> 00:29:31,279
i do think the direction on some of the
 

1795
00:29:31,279 --> 00:29:33,510
i do think the direction on some of the
ai advances that is happening to be able

1796
00:29:33,510 --> 00:29:33,520
ai advances that is happening to be able
 

1797
00:29:33,520 --> 00:29:35,350
ai advances that is happening to be able
to especially stuff around like style

1798
00:29:35,350 --> 00:29:35,360
to especially stuff around like style
 

1799
00:29:35,360 --> 00:29:37,909
to especially stuff around like style

i've designed for my expressive avatar

1816
00:29:53,909 --> 00:29:53,919
i've designed for my expressive avatar
 

1817
00:29:53,919 --> 00:29:55,029
i've designed for my expressive avatar
um

1818
00:29:55,029 --> 00:29:55,039
um
 

1819
00:29:55,039 --> 00:29:55,990
um
i think that's going to be pretty

1820
00:29:55,990 --> 00:29:56,000
i think that's going to be pretty
 

1821
00:29:56,000 --> 00:29:58,389
i think that's going to be pretty
compelling and so the fashion you you

1822
00:29:58,389 --> 00:29:58,399
compelling and so the fashion you you
 

1823
00:29:58,399 --> 00:30:00,310
compelling and so the fashion you you
might be buying like a generator like a

1824
00:30:00,310 --> 00:30:00,320
might be buying like a generator like a
 

1825
00:30:00,320 --> 00:30:03,190
might be buying like a generator like a
closet that generates a style

1826
00:30:03,190 --> 00:30:03,200
closet that generates a style
 

1827
00:30:03,200 --> 00:30:04,389
closet that generates a style
and then

1828
00:30:04,389 --> 00:30:04,399
and then
 

1829
00:30:04,399 --> 00:30:05,830
and then
like like with the gans they'll be able

1830
00:30:05,830 --> 00:30:05,840
like like with the gans they'll be able
 

1831
00:30:05,840 --> 00:30:08,470
like like with the gans they'll be able
to infinitely generate outfits thereby

1832
00:30:08,470 --> 00:30:08,480
to infinitely generate outfits thereby
 

1833
00:30:08,480 --> 00:30:10,470
to infinitely generate outfits thereby
making it so the reason i wear the same

1834
00:30:10,470 --> 00:30:10,480
making it so the reason i wear the same
 

1835
00:30:10,480 --> 00:30:11,909
making it so the reason i wear the same
thing all the time is that don't like

1836
00:30:11,909 --> 00:30:11,919
thing all the time is that don't like
 

1837
00:30:11,919 --> 00:30:13,350
thing all the time is that don't like
choice you're talking about you've

1838
00:30:13,350 --> 00:30:13,360
choice you're talking about you've
 

1839
00:30:13,360 --> 00:30:15,510
choice you're talking about you've
talked about the same thing but now you

1840
00:30:15,510 --> 00:30:15,520
talked about the same thing but now you
 

1841
00:30:15,520 --> 00:30:17,190
talked about the same thing but now you
don't even have to choose your closet

1842
00:30:17,190 --> 00:30:17,200
don't even have to choose your closet
 

1843
00:30:17,200 --> 00:30:19,510
don't even have to choose your closet
generates your outfit for you every time

1844
00:30:19,510 --> 00:30:19,520
generates your outfit for you every time
 

1845
00:30:19,520 --> 00:30:21,110
generates your outfit for you every time
so you have to

1846
00:30:21,110 --> 00:30:21,120
so you have to
 

1847
00:30:21,120 --> 00:30:23,269
so you have to
live without the generates

1848
00:30:23,269 --> 00:30:23,279
live without the generates
 

1849
00:30:23,279 --> 00:30:25,350
live without the generates
i mean you could do that although

1850
00:30:25,350 --> 00:30:25,360
i mean you could do that although
 

1851
00:30:25,360 --> 00:30:26,630
i mean you could do that although
no i think that that's i think some

1852
00:30:26,630 --> 00:30:26,640
no i think that that's i think some
 

1853
00:30:26,640 --> 00:30:28,950
no i think that that's i think some
people will but i think like

1854
00:30:28,950 --> 00:30:28,960
people will but i think like
 

1855
00:30:28,960 --> 00:30:30,470
people will but i think like
i think there's going to be a huge

1856
00:30:30,470 --> 00:30:30,480
i think there's going to be a huge
 

1857
00:30:30,480 --> 00:30:33,590
i think there's going to be a huge
aspect of

1858
00:30:33,590 --> 00:30:33,600

 

1859
00:30:33,600 --> 00:30:35,590

of just people doing creative commerce

1860
00:30:35,590 --> 00:30:35,600
of just people doing creative commerce
 

1861
00:30:35,600 --> 00:30:37,029
of just people doing creative commerce
here so i think there is going to be a

1862
00:30:37,029 --> 00:30:37,039
here so i think there is going to be a
 

1863
00:30:37,039 --> 00:30:39,190
here so i think there is going to be a
big market around people designing

1864
00:30:39,190 --> 00:30:39,200
big market around people designing
 

1865
00:30:39,200 --> 00:30:41,590
big market around people designing
digital clothing um but the question is

1866
00:30:41,590 --> 00:30:41,600
digital clothing um but the question is
 

1867
00:30:41,600 --> 00:30:42,950
digital clothing um but the question is
if you're designing digital clothing do

1868
00:30:42,950 --> 00:30:42,960
if you're designing digital clothing do
 

1869
00:30:42,960 --> 00:30:44,230
if you're designing digital clothing do
you need to design if you're if you're

1870
00:30:44,230 --> 00:30:44,240
you need to design if you're if you're
 

1871
00:30:44,240 --> 00:30:46,070
you need to design if you're if you're
the designer do you need to make it for

1872
00:30:46,070 --> 00:30:46,080
the designer do you need to make it for
 

1873
00:30:46,080 --> 00:30:48,310
the designer do you need to make it for
each kind of specific discrete point

1874
00:30:48,310 --> 00:30:48,320
each kind of specific discrete point
 

1875
00:30:48,320 --> 00:30:49,830
each kind of specific discrete point
along a spectrum

1876
00:30:49,830 --> 00:30:49,840
along a spectrum
 

1877
00:30:49,840 --> 00:30:51,430
along a spectrum
or you design are you just designing it

1878
00:30:51,430 --> 00:30:51,440
or you design are you just designing it
 

1879
00:30:51,440 --> 00:30:53,110
or you design are you just designing it
for kind of a photo realistic case or an

1880
00:30:53,110 --> 00:30:53,120
for kind of a photo realistic case or an
 

1881
00:30:53,120 --> 00:30:55,029
for kind of a photo realistic case or an
expressive case or can you design one

1882
00:30:55,029 --> 00:30:55,039
expressive case or can you design one
 

1883
00:30:55,039 --> 00:30:56,710
expressive case or can you design one
and have it translate across these

1884
00:30:56,710 --> 00:30:56,720
and have it translate across these
 

1885
00:30:56,720 --> 00:30:59,509
and have it translate across these
things um you know if i if i buy a style

1886
00:30:59,509 --> 00:30:59,519
things um you know if i if i buy a style
 

1887
00:30:59,519 --> 00:31:01,430
things um you know if i if i buy a style
from you know a designer who i care

1888
00:31:01,430 --> 00:31:01,440
from you know a designer who i care
 

1889
00:31:01,440 --> 00:31:03,110
from you know a designer who i care
about and now i'm a dragon you know is

1890
00:31:03,110 --> 00:31:03,120
about and now i'm a dragon you know is
 

1891
00:31:03,120 --> 00:31:04,549
about and now i'm a dragon you know is
there a way to morph that so it like

1892
00:31:04,549 --> 00:31:04,559
there a way to morph that so it like
 

1893
00:31:04,559 --> 00:31:06,310
there a way to morph that so it like
goes on the dragon in a way that makes

1894
00:31:06,310 --> 00:31:06,320
goes on the dragon in a way that makes
 

1895
00:31:06,320 --> 00:31:08,310
goes on the dragon in a way that makes
sense um and that i think is an

1896
00:31:08,310 --> 00:31:08,320
sense um and that i think is an
 

1897
00:31:08,320 --> 00:31:09,830
sense um and that i think is an
interesting ai problem because you're

1898
00:31:09,830 --> 00:31:09,840
interesting ai problem because you're
 

1899
00:31:09,840 --> 00:31:11,830
interesting ai problem because you're
probably not going to make it so that

1900
00:31:11,830 --> 00:31:11,840
probably not going to make it so that
 

1901
00:31:11,840 --> 00:31:13,830
probably not going to make it so that
like that designers have to go design

1902
00:31:13,830 --> 00:31:13,840
like that designers have to go design
 

1903
00:31:13,840 --> 00:31:15,909
like that designers have to go design
for all those things but the more useful

1904
00:31:15,909 --> 00:31:15,919
for all those things but the more useful
 

1905
00:31:15,919 --> 00:31:17,990
for all those things but the more useful
the digital content is that you buy in a

1906
00:31:17,990 --> 00:31:18,000
the digital content is that you buy in a
 

1907
00:31:18,000 --> 00:31:19,350
the digital content is that you buy in a
lot of uses

1908
00:31:19,350 --> 00:31:19,360
lot of uses
 

1909
00:31:19,360 --> 00:31:21,269
lot of uses
in a lot of use cases

1910
00:31:21,269 --> 00:31:21,279
in a lot of use cases
 

1911
00:31:21,279 --> 00:31:22,710
in a lot of use cases
the the more that economy will just

1912
00:31:22,710 --> 00:31:22,720
the the more that economy will just
 

1913
00:31:22,720 --> 00:31:24,710
the the more that economy will just
explode and that's a lot of what you

1914
00:31:24,710 --> 00:31:24,720
explode and that's a lot of what you
 

1915
00:31:24,720 --> 00:31:26,630
explode and that's a lot of what you
know all of the um

1916
00:31:26,630 --> 00:31:26,640
know all of the um
 

1917
00:31:26,640 --> 00:31:27,990
know all of the um
you know

1918
00:31:27,990 --> 00:31:28,000
you know
 

1919
00:31:28,000 --> 00:31:29,830
you know
we were joking about nfts before but i

1920
00:31:29,830 --> 00:31:29,840
we were joking about nfts before but i
 

1921
00:31:29,840 --> 00:31:32,470
we were joking about nfts before but i
think a lot of the promise here is that

1922
00:31:32,470 --> 00:31:32,480
think a lot of the promise here is that
 

1923
00:31:32,480 --> 00:31:34,230
think a lot of the promise here is that
if the digital goods that you buy are

1924
00:31:34,230 --> 00:31:34,240
if the digital goods that you buy are
 

1925
00:31:34,240 --> 00:31:36,710
if the digital goods that you buy are
not just tied to one platform or one use

1926
00:31:36,710 --> 00:31:36,720
not just tied to one platform or one use
 

1927
00:31:36,720 --> 00:31:38,149
not just tied to one platform or one use
case they end up being more valuable

1928
00:31:38,149 --> 00:31:38,159
case they end up being more valuable
 

1929
00:31:38,159 --> 00:31:39,750
case they end up being more valuable
which means that people are more willing

1930
00:31:39,750 --> 00:31:39,760
which means that people are more willing
 

1931
00:31:39,760 --> 00:31:41,350
which means that people are more willing
and more likely to invest in them and

1932
00:31:41,350 --> 00:31:41,360
and more likely to invest in them and
 

1933
00:31:41,360 --> 00:31:42,310
and more likely to invest in them and
that

1934
00:31:42,310 --> 00:31:42,320
that
 

1935
00:31:42,320 --> 00:31:44,470
that
that just spurs the whole economy but

1936
00:31:44,470 --> 00:31:44,480
that just spurs the whole economy but
 

1937
00:31:44,480 --> 00:31:46,230
that just spurs the whole economy but
the question is that's a fascinating

1938
00:31:46,230 --> 00:31:46,240
the question is that's a fascinating
 

1939
00:31:46,240 --> 00:31:48,630
the question is that's a fascinating
positive aspect but the potential

1940
00:31:48,630 --> 00:31:48,640
positive aspect but the potential
 

1941
00:31:48,640 --> 00:31:50,630
positive aspect but the potential
negative aspect is that

1942
00:31:50,630 --> 00:31:50,640
negative aspect is that
 

1943
00:31:50,640 --> 00:31:52,070
negative aspect is that
you can have people concealing their

1944
00:31:52,070 --> 00:31:52,080
you can have people concealing their
 

1945
00:31:52,080 --> 00:31:55,430
you can have people concealing their
identity in order to troll or even not

1946
00:31:55,430 --> 00:31:55,440
identity in order to troll or even not
 

1947
00:31:55,440 --> 00:31:56,870
identity in order to troll or even not
people bots

1948
00:31:56,870 --> 00:31:56,880
people bots
 

1949
00:31:56,880 --> 00:31:58,789
people bots
so how do you know in the metaverse that

1950
00:31:58,789 --> 00:31:58,799
so how do you know in the metaverse that
 

1951
00:31:58,799 --> 00:32:01,990
so how do you know in the metaverse that
you're talking to a real human or an ai

1952
00:32:01,990 --> 00:32:02,000
you're talking to a real human or an ai
 

1953
00:32:02,000 --> 00:32:03,990
you're talking to a real human or an ai
or a well-intentioned human is that

1954
00:32:03,990 --> 00:32:04,000
or a well-intentioned human is that
 

1955
00:32:04,000 --> 00:32:05,110
or a well-intentioned human is that
something you think about something

1956
00:32:05,110 --> 00:32:05,120
something you think about something
 

1957
00:32:05,120 --> 00:32:06,789
something you think about something
you're concerned about

1958
00:32:06,789 --> 00:32:06,799
you're concerned about
 

1959
00:32:06,799 --> 00:32:07,750
you're concerned about
well

1960
00:32:07,750 --> 00:32:07,760
well
 

1961
00:32:07,760 --> 00:32:09,190
well
let's break that down into a few

1962
00:32:09,190 --> 00:32:09,200
let's break that down into a few
 

1963
00:32:09,200 --> 00:32:10,870
let's break that down into a few
different cases i mean because knowing

1964
00:32:10,870 --> 00:32:10,880
different cases i mean because knowing
 

1965
00:32:10,880 --> 00:32:12,149
different cases i mean because knowing
that you're talking to someone who has

1966
00:32:12,149 --> 00:32:12,159
that you're talking to someone who has
 

1967
00:32:12,159 --> 00:32:13,590
that you're talking to someone who has
good intentions is something that i

1968
00:32:13,590 --> 00:32:13,600
good intentions is something that i
 

1969
00:32:13,600 --> 00:32:16,710
good intentions is something that i
think is not even solved in right in

1970
00:32:16,710 --> 00:32:16,720
think is not even solved in right in
 

1971
00:32:16,720 --> 00:32:18,470
think is not even solved in right in
pretty much anywhere but

1972
00:32:18,470 --> 00:32:18,480
pretty much anywhere but
 

1973
00:32:18,480 --> 00:32:19,509
pretty much anywhere but
i mean if you're talking to someone

1974
00:32:19,509 --> 00:32:19,519
i mean if you're talking to someone
 

1975
00:32:19,519 --> 00:32:20,950
i mean if you're talking to someone
who's a dragon i think it's pretty clear

1976
00:32:20,950 --> 00:32:20,960
who's a dragon i think it's pretty clear
 

1977
00:32:20,960 --> 00:32:22,310
who's a dragon i think it's pretty clear
that they're not representing themselves

1978
00:32:22,310 --> 00:32:22,320
that they're not representing themselves
 

1979
00:32:22,320 --> 00:32:24,230
that they're not representing themselves
as a person i think probably the most

1980
00:32:24,230 --> 00:32:24,240
as a person i think probably the most
 

1981
00:32:24,240 --> 00:32:26,710
as a person i think probably the most
pernicious thing that you want to

1982
00:32:26,710 --> 00:32:26,720
pernicious thing that you want to
 

1983
00:32:26,720 --> 00:32:30,070
pernicious thing that you want to
solve for is um

1984
00:32:30,070 --> 00:32:30,080
solve for is um
 

1985
00:32:30,080 --> 00:32:31,269
solve for is um
i think probably one of the scariest

1986
00:32:31,269 --> 00:32:31,279
i think probably one of the scariest
 

1987
00:32:31,279 --> 00:32:32,789
i think probably one of the scariest
ones is how do you make sure that

1988
00:32:32,789 --> 00:32:32,799
ones is how do you make sure that
 

1989
00:32:32,799 --> 00:32:35,590
ones is how do you make sure that
someone isn't impersonating you right so

1990
00:32:35,590 --> 00:32:35,600
someone isn't impersonating you right so
 

1991
00:32:35,600 --> 00:32:37,669
someone isn't impersonating you right so
like okay you're in a future version of

1992
00:32:37,669 --> 00:32:37,679
like okay you're in a future version of
 

1993
00:32:37,679 --> 00:32:40,310
like okay you're in a future version of
of this conversation yeah and we have

1994
00:32:40,310 --> 00:32:40,320
of this conversation yeah and we have
 

1995
00:32:40,320 --> 00:32:42,070
of this conversation yeah and we have
photorealistic avatars and we're doing

1996
00:32:42,070 --> 00:32:42,080
photorealistic avatars and we're doing
 

1997
00:32:42,080 --> 00:32:43,590
photorealistic avatars and we're doing
this in work rooms or whatever the

1998
00:32:43,590 --> 00:32:43,600
this in work rooms or whatever the
 

1999
00:32:43,600 --> 00:32:45,430
this in work rooms or whatever the
future version of that is and someone

2000
00:32:45,430 --> 00:32:45,440
future version of that is and someone
 

2001
00:32:45,440 --> 00:32:48,870
future version of that is and someone
walks in who like looks like me um how

2002
00:32:48,870 --> 00:32:48,880
walks in who like looks like me um how
 

2003
00:32:48,880 --> 00:32:51,350
walks in who like looks like me um how
do you know that that's me and

2004
00:32:51,350 --> 00:32:51,360
do you know that that's me and
 

2005
00:32:51,360 --> 00:32:53,029
do you know that that's me and
one of the things that we're that we're

2006
00:32:53,029 --> 00:32:53,039
one of the things that we're that we're
 

2007
00:32:53,039 --> 00:32:54,149
one of the things that we're that we're
thinking about

2008
00:32:54,149 --> 00:32:54,159
thinking about
 

2009
00:32:54,159 --> 00:32:55,830
thinking about
is you know it's this

2010
00:32:55,830 --> 00:32:55,840
is you know it's this
 

2011
00:32:55,840 --> 00:32:57,509
is you know it's this
it's still a pretty big ai project to be

2012
00:32:57,509 --> 00:32:57,519
it's still a pretty big ai project to be
 

2013
00:32:57,519 --> 00:32:59,350
it's still a pretty big ai project to be
able to generate photorealistic avatars

2014
00:32:59,350 --> 00:32:59,360
able to generate photorealistic avatars
 

2015
00:32:59,360 --> 00:33:01,750
able to generate photorealistic avatars
that basically can like they work like

2016
00:33:01,750 --> 00:33:01,760
that basically can like they work like
 

2017
00:33:01,760 --> 00:33:03,830
that basically can like they work like
these codecs of you right so you you

2018
00:33:03,830 --> 00:33:03,840
these codecs of you right so you you
 

2019
00:33:03,840 --> 00:33:05,669
these codecs of you right so you you
kind of have a map from your your

2020
00:33:05,669 --> 00:33:05,679
kind of have a map from your your
 

2021
00:33:05,679 --> 00:33:07,110
kind of have a map from your your
headset and whatever sensors what your

2022
00:33:07,110 --> 00:33:07,120
headset and whatever sensors what your
 

2023
00:33:07,120 --> 00:33:08,389
headset and whatever sensors what your
body is actually doing and it takes the

2024
00:33:08,389 --> 00:33:08,399
body is actually doing and it takes the
 

2025
00:33:08,399 --> 00:33:10,149
body is actually doing and it takes the
model in it and it kind of displays it

2026
00:33:10,149 --> 00:33:10,159
model in it and it kind of displays it
 

2027
00:33:10,159 --> 00:33:12,549
model in it and it kind of displays it
in vr but there's a question which is

2028
00:33:12,549 --> 00:33:12,559
in vr but there's a question which is
 

2029
00:33:12,559 --> 00:33:14,389
in vr but there's a question which is
should there be some sort of biometric

2030
00:33:14,389 --> 00:33:14,399
should there be some sort of biometric
 

2031
00:33:14,399 --> 00:33:17,029
should there be some sort of biometric
security so that like when i put on my

2032
00:33:17,029 --> 00:33:17,039
security so that like when i put on my
 

2033
00:33:17,039 --> 00:33:19,590
security so that like when i put on my
vr headset or i'm going to you know go

2034
00:33:19,590 --> 00:33:19,600
vr headset or i'm going to you know go
 

2035
00:33:19,600 --> 00:33:22,549
vr headset or i'm going to you know go
use that avatar i need to first prove

2036
00:33:22,549 --> 00:33:22,559
use that avatar i need to first prove
 

2037
00:33:22,559 --> 00:33:25,430
use that avatar i need to first prove
that i am that and i think you probably

2038
00:33:25,430 --> 00:33:25,440
that i am that and i think you probably
 

2039
00:33:25,440 --> 00:33:27,190
that i am that and i think you probably
are going to want something like that so

2040
00:33:27,190 --> 00:33:27,200
are going to want something like that so
 

2041
00:33:27,200 --> 00:33:29,110
are going to want something like that so
um so that's you know as we're

2042
00:33:29,110 --> 00:33:29,120
um so that's you know as we're
 

2043
00:33:29,120 --> 00:33:31,509
um so that's you know as we're
developing these technologies we're also

2044
00:33:31,509 --> 00:33:31,519
developing these technologies we're also
 

2045
00:33:31,519 --> 00:33:33,029
developing these technologies we're also
thinking about the security for things

2046
00:33:33,029 --> 00:33:33,039
thinking about the security for things
 

2047
00:33:33,039 --> 00:33:35,830
thinking about the security for things
like that um because you know people

2048
00:33:35,830 --> 00:33:35,840
like that um because you know people
 

2049
00:33:35,840 --> 00:33:36,950
like that um because you know people
aren't going to want to be impersonated

2050
00:33:36,950 --> 00:33:36,960
aren't going to want to be impersonated
 

2051
00:33:36,960 --> 00:33:39,110
aren't going to want to be impersonated
that's a that's a huge security issue

2052
00:33:39,110 --> 00:33:39,120
that's a that's a huge security issue
 

2053
00:33:39,120 --> 00:33:41,590
that's a that's a huge security issue
um

2054
00:33:41,590 --> 00:33:41,600

 

2055
00:33:41,600 --> 00:33:43,269

then you just get the question of people

2056
00:33:43,269 --> 00:33:43,279
then you just get the question of people
 

2057
00:33:43,279 --> 00:33:44,950
then you just get the question of people
hiding behind

2058
00:33:44,950 --> 00:33:44,960
hiding behind
 

2059
00:33:44,960 --> 00:33:48,230
hiding behind
fake accounts to do malicious things

2060
00:33:48,230 --> 00:33:48,240
fake accounts to do malicious things
 

2061
00:33:48,240 --> 00:33:48,950
fake accounts to do malicious things
which

2062
00:33:48,950 --> 00:33:48,960
which
 

2063
00:33:48,960 --> 00:33:50,310
which
is not going to be unique to the

2064
00:33:50,310 --> 00:33:50,320
is not going to be unique to the
 

2065
00:33:50,320 --> 00:33:52,470
is not going to be unique to the
metaverse although

2066
00:33:52,470 --> 00:33:52,480
metaverse although
 

2067
00:33:52,480 --> 00:33:54,149
metaverse although
you know certainly

2068
00:33:54,149 --> 00:33:54,159
you know certainly
 

2069
00:33:54,159 --> 00:33:55,350
you know certainly
in a

2070
00:33:55,350 --> 00:33:55,360
in a
 

2071
00:33:55,360 --> 00:33:57,110
in a
environment where it's more immersive

2072
00:33:57,110 --> 00:33:57,120
environment where it's more immersive
 

2073
00:33:57,120 --> 00:33:58,470
environment where it's more immersive
and you have more of a sense of presence

2074
00:33:58,470 --> 00:33:58,480
and you have more of a sense of presence
 

2075
00:33:58,480 --> 00:33:59,830
and you have more of a sense of presence
it could be more

2076
00:33:59,830 --> 00:33:59,840
it could be more
 

2077
00:33:59,840 --> 00:34:02,389
it could be more
painful more painful but this is

2078
00:34:02,389 --> 00:34:02,399
painful more painful but this is
 

2079
00:34:02,399 --> 00:34:03,430
painful more painful but this is
obviously something that we've just

2080
00:34:03,430 --> 00:34:03,440
obviously something that we've just
 

2081
00:34:03,440 --> 00:34:04,950
obviously something that we've just
dealt with for

2082
00:34:04,950 --> 00:34:04,960
dealt with for
 

2083
00:34:04,960 --> 00:34:07,269
dealt with for
years um in social media and the

2084
00:34:07,269 --> 00:34:07,279
years um in social media and the
 

2085
00:34:07,279 --> 00:34:10,230
years um in social media and the
internet more broadly and there i think

2086
00:34:10,230 --> 00:34:10,240
internet more broadly and there i think
 

2087
00:34:10,240 --> 00:34:11,510
internet more broadly and there i think
um

2088
00:34:11,510 --> 00:34:11,520
um
 

2089
00:34:11,520 --> 00:34:13,669
um
there have been a bunch of tactics that

2090
00:34:13,669 --> 00:34:13,679
there have been a bunch of tactics that
 

2091
00:34:13,679 --> 00:34:15,750
there have been a bunch of tactics that
that i think um

2092
00:34:15,750 --> 00:34:15,760
that i think um
 

2093
00:34:15,760 --> 00:34:17,909
that i think um
we've just evolved to you know we've

2094
00:34:17,909 --> 00:34:17,919
we've just evolved to you know we've
 

2095
00:34:17,919 --> 00:34:19,270
we've just evolved to you know we've
built up these

2096
00:34:19,270 --> 00:34:19,280
built up these
 

2097
00:34:19,280 --> 00:34:21,030
built up these
different ai systems to basically get a

2098
00:34:21,030 --> 00:34:21,040
different ai systems to basically get a
 

2099
00:34:21,040 --> 00:34:22,869
different ai systems to basically get a
sense of is this

2100
00:34:22,869 --> 00:34:22,879
sense of is this
 

2101
00:34:22,879 --> 00:34:24,069
sense of is this
account

2102
00:34:24,069 --> 00:34:24,079
account
 

2103
00:34:24,079 --> 00:34:26,230
account
behaving in the way that a person would

2104
00:34:26,230 --> 00:34:26,240
behaving in the way that a person would
 

2105
00:34:26,240 --> 00:34:27,430
behaving in the way that a person would
and

2106
00:34:27,430 --> 00:34:27,440
and
 

2107
00:34:27,440 --> 00:34:28,790
and
it turns out you know so in all of the

2108
00:34:28,790 --> 00:34:28,800
it turns out you know so in all of the
 

2109
00:34:28,800 --> 00:34:31,030
it turns out you know so in all of the
work that we've done um

2110
00:34:31,030 --> 00:34:31,040
work that we've done um
 

2111
00:34:31,040 --> 00:34:32,629
work that we've done um
around you know we call it community

2112
00:34:32,629 --> 00:34:32,639
around you know we call it community
 

2113
00:34:32,639 --> 00:34:34,629
around you know we call it community
integrity and it's basically like

2114
00:34:34,629 --> 00:34:34,639
integrity and it's basically like
 

2115
00:34:34,639 --> 00:34:35,829
integrity and it's basically like
policing

2116
00:34:35,829 --> 00:34:35,839
policing
 

2117
00:34:35,839 --> 00:34:37,510
policing
harmful content and trying to figure out

2118
00:34:37,510 --> 00:34:37,520
harmful content and trying to figure out
 

2119
00:34:37,520 --> 00:34:38,629
harmful content and trying to figure out
where to draw the line and there are all

2120
00:34:38,629 --> 00:34:38,639
where to draw the line and there are all
 

2121
00:34:38,639 --> 00:34:40,550
where to draw the line and there are all
these like really hard and philosophical

2122
00:34:40,550 --> 00:34:40,560
these like really hard and philosophical
 

2123
00:34:40,560 --> 00:34:41,669
these like really hard and philosophical
questions around like where do you draw

2124
00:34:41,669 --> 00:34:41,679
questions around like where do you draw
 

2125
00:34:41,679 --> 00:34:43,589
questions around like where do you draw
the line on some of this stuff and

2126
00:34:43,589 --> 00:34:43,599
the line on some of this stuff and
 

2127
00:34:43,599 --> 00:34:46,230
the line on some of this stuff and
the the thing that i i've kind of found

2128
00:34:46,230 --> 00:34:46,240
the the thing that i i've kind of found
 

2129
00:34:46,240 --> 00:34:47,669
the the thing that i i've kind of found
the most effective

2130
00:34:47,669 --> 00:34:47,679
the most effective
 

2131
00:34:47,679 --> 00:34:48,869
the most effective
is

2132
00:34:48,869 --> 00:34:48,879
is
 

2133
00:34:48,879 --> 00:34:51,109
is
as much as possible trying to figure out

2134
00:34:51,109 --> 00:34:51,119
as much as possible trying to figure out
 

2135
00:34:51,119 --> 00:34:53,349
as much as possible trying to figure out
who are the uh inauthentic accounts or

2136
00:34:53,349 --> 00:34:53,359
who are the uh inauthentic accounts or
 

2137
00:34:53,359 --> 00:34:55,510
who are the uh inauthentic accounts or
where the accounts that are behaving in

2138
00:34:55,510 --> 00:34:55,520
where the accounts that are behaving in
 

2139
00:34:55,520 --> 00:34:57,270
where the accounts that are behaving in
an overall harmful way at the account

2140
00:34:57,270 --> 00:34:57,280
an overall harmful way at the account
 

2141
00:34:57,280 --> 00:34:58,310
an overall harmful way at the account
level

2142
00:34:58,310 --> 00:34:58,320
level
 

2143
00:34:58,320 --> 00:34:59,589
level
rather than trying to get into like

2144
00:34:59,589 --> 00:34:59,599
rather than trying to get into like
 

2145
00:34:59,599 --> 00:35:01,349
rather than trying to get into like
policing what they're saying right which

2146
00:35:01,349 --> 00:35:01,359
policing what they're saying right which
 

2147
00:35:01,359 --> 00:35:02,550
policing what they're saying right which
i think the metaverse is going to even

2148
00:35:02,550 --> 00:35:02,560
i think the metaverse is going to even
 

2149
00:35:02,560 --> 00:35:04,550
i think the metaverse is going to even
harder um because that the metaverse i

2150
00:35:04,550 --> 00:35:04,560
harder um because that the metaverse i
 

2151
00:35:04,560 --> 00:35:06,470
harder um because that the metaverse i
think will have more properties of

2152
00:35:06,470 --> 00:35:06,480
think will have more properties of
 

2153
00:35:06,480 --> 00:35:08,790
think will have more properties of
um it's almost more like a phone call

2154
00:35:08,790 --> 00:35:08,800
um it's almost more like a phone call
 

2155
00:35:08,800 --> 00:35:10,630
um it's almost more like a phone call
right or like or you're you know it's

2156
00:35:10,630 --> 00:35:10,640
right or like or you're you know it's
 

2157
00:35:10,640 --> 00:35:12,310
right or like or you're you know it's
not like i post a piece of content and

2158
00:35:12,310 --> 00:35:12,320
not like i post a piece of content and
 

2159
00:35:12,320 --> 00:35:14,310
not like i post a piece of content and
is that piece of content good or bad

2160
00:35:14,310 --> 00:35:14,320
is that piece of content good or bad
 

2161
00:35:14,320 --> 00:35:15,589
is that piece of content good or bad
um so i think more of this stuff will

2162
00:35:15,589 --> 00:35:15,599
um so i think more of this stuff will
 

2163
00:35:15,599 --> 00:35:17,589
um so i think more of this stuff will
have to be done at the level of

2164
00:35:17,589 --> 00:35:17,599
have to be done at the level of
 

2165
00:35:17,599 --> 00:35:20,230
have to be done at the level of
um of the account but

2166
00:35:20,230 --> 00:35:20,240
um of the account but
 

2167
00:35:20,240 --> 00:35:22,069
um of the account but
this is the area where you know between

2168
00:35:22,069 --> 00:35:22,079
this is the area where you know between
 

2169
00:35:22,079 --> 00:35:22,950
this is the area where you know between
the

2170
00:35:22,950 --> 00:35:22,960
the
 

2171
00:35:22,960 --> 00:35:24,230
the
the kind of

2172
00:35:24,230 --> 00:35:24,240
the kind of
 

2173
00:35:24,240 --> 00:35:25,510
the kind of
um

2174
00:35:25,510 --> 00:35:25,520
um
 

2175
00:35:25,520 --> 00:35:27,030
um
you know counterintelligence teams that

2176
00:35:27,030 --> 00:35:27,040
you know counterintelligence teams that
 

2177
00:35:27,040 --> 00:35:28,630
you know counterintelligence teams that
we built up inside the company and like

2178
00:35:28,630 --> 00:35:28,640
we built up inside the company and like
 

2179
00:35:28,640 --> 00:35:31,109
we built up inside the company and like
years of building um

2180
00:35:31,109 --> 00:35:31,119
years of building um
 

2181
00:35:31,119 --> 00:35:32,550
years of building um
just different ai

2182
00:35:32,550 --> 00:35:32,560
just different ai
 

2183
00:35:32,560 --> 00:35:35,270
just different ai
systems to basically detect what is a

2184
00:35:35,270 --> 00:35:35,280
systems to basically detect what is a
 

2185
00:35:35,280 --> 00:35:36,950
systems to basically detect what is a
real account and what isn't i'm not

2186
00:35:36,950 --> 00:35:36,960
real account and what isn't i'm not
 

2187
00:35:36,960 --> 00:35:38,950
real account and what isn't i'm not
saying we're perfect but like this is an

2188
00:35:38,950 --> 00:35:38,960
saying we're perfect but like this is an
 

2189
00:35:38,960 --> 00:35:41,030
saying we're perfect but like this is an
area where i just think we are like

2190
00:35:41,030 --> 00:35:41,040
area where i just think we are like
 

2191
00:35:41,040 --> 00:35:43,510
area where i just think we are like
years ahead of basically anyone else in

2192
00:35:43,510 --> 00:35:43,520
years ahead of basically anyone else in
 

2193
00:35:43,520 --> 00:35:45,829
years ahead of basically anyone else in
the in the industry in terms of having

2194
00:35:45,829 --> 00:35:45,839
the in the industry in terms of having
 

2195
00:35:45,839 --> 00:35:46,630
the in the industry in terms of having
um

2196
00:35:46,630 --> 00:35:46,640
um
 

2197
00:35:46,640 --> 00:35:48,230
um
uh built those capabilities and i think

2198
00:35:48,230 --> 00:35:48,240
uh built those capabilities and i think
 

2199
00:35:48,240 --> 00:35:49,589
uh built those capabilities and i think
that just is going to be incredibly

2200
00:35:49,589 --> 00:35:49,599
that just is going to be incredibly
 

2201
00:35:49,599 --> 00:35:51,349
that just is going to be incredibly
important for this next wave of things

2202
00:35:51,349 --> 00:35:51,359
important for this next wave of things
 

2203
00:35:51,359 --> 00:35:53,270
important for this next wave of things
and like you said on the technical level

2204
00:35:53,270 --> 00:35:53,280
and like you said on the technical level
 

2205
00:35:53,280 --> 00:35:55,109
and like you said on the technical level
on a philosophical level it's an

2206
00:35:55,109 --> 00:35:55,119
on a philosophical level it's an
 

2207
00:35:55,119 --> 00:35:58,630
on a philosophical level it's an
incredibly difficult problem to solve

2208
00:35:58,630 --> 00:35:58,640
incredibly difficult problem to solve
 

2209
00:35:58,640 --> 00:36:01,109
incredibly difficult problem to solve
uh by the way i i would probably like to

2210
00:36:01,109 --> 00:36:01,119
uh by the way i i would probably like to
 

2211
00:36:01,119 --> 00:36:03,750
uh by the way i i would probably like to
open source my avatar so there could be

2212
00:36:03,750 --> 00:36:03,760
open source my avatar so there could be
 

2213
00:36:03,760 --> 00:36:05,750
open source my avatar so there could be
like millions of lexes walking around

2214
00:36:05,750 --> 00:36:05,760
like millions of lexes walking around
 

2215
00:36:05,760 --> 00:36:08,630
like millions of lexes walking around
just like an army like agent smith agent

2216
00:36:08,630 --> 00:36:08,640
just like an army like agent smith agent
 

2217
00:36:08,640 --> 00:36:10,230
just like an army like agent smith agent
smith yeah exactly

2218
00:36:10,230 --> 00:36:10,240
smith yeah exactly
 

2219
00:36:10,240 --> 00:36:14,950
smith yeah exactly
uh so the uh the unity ml folks built a

2220
00:36:14,950 --> 00:36:14,960
uh so the uh the unity ml folks built a
 

2221
00:36:14,960 --> 00:36:16,230
uh so the uh the unity ml folks built a
copy of me

2222
00:36:16,230 --> 00:36:16,240
copy of me
 

2223
00:36:16,240 --> 00:36:18,310
copy of me
and they sent it to me

2224
00:36:18,310 --> 00:36:18,320
and they sent it to me
 

2225
00:36:18,320 --> 00:36:19,750
and they sent it to me
so there's a there's a person running

2226
00:36:19,750 --> 00:36:19,760
so there's a there's a person running
 

2227
00:36:19,760 --> 00:36:20,790
so there's a there's a person running
around and i've just been doing

2228
00:36:20,790 --> 00:36:20,800
around and i've just been doing
 

2229
00:36:20,800 --> 00:36:22,870
around and i've just been doing
reinforcement learning on it i was gonna

2230
00:36:22,870 --> 00:36:22,880
reinforcement learning on it i was gonna
 

2231
00:36:22,880 --> 00:36:24,310
reinforcement learning on it i was gonna
release it

2232
00:36:24,310 --> 00:36:24,320
release it
 

2233
00:36:24,320 --> 00:36:25,510
release it
now

2234
00:36:25,510 --> 00:36:25,520
now
 

2235
00:36:25,520 --> 00:36:27,510
now
because you know just to have

2236
00:36:27,510 --> 00:36:27,520
because you know just to have
 

2237
00:36:27,520 --> 00:36:30,390
because you know just to have
sort of like thousands of lexus doing uh

2238
00:36:30,390 --> 00:36:30,400
sort of like thousands of lexus doing uh
 

2239
00:36:30,400 --> 00:36:31,829
sort of like thousands of lexus doing uh
reinforcements so they fall over

2240
00:36:31,829 --> 00:36:31,839
reinforcements so they fall over
 

2241
00:36:31,839 --> 00:36:33,589
reinforcements so they fall over
naturally they have to learn how to like

2242
00:36:33,589 --> 00:36:33,599
naturally they have to learn how to like
 

2243
00:36:33,599 --> 00:36:35,829
naturally they have to learn how to like
walk around and stuff so i love that

2244
00:36:35,829 --> 00:36:35,839

security you want to have one identity

2248
00:36:40,230 --> 00:36:40,240
security you want to have one identity
 

2249
00:36:40,240 --> 00:36:41,750
security you want to have one identity
but then certain avatars you might have

2250
00:36:41,750 --> 00:36:41,760
but then certain avatars you might have
 

2251
00:36:41,760 --> 00:36:43,430
but then certain avatars you might have
to have many

2252
00:36:43,430 --> 00:36:43,440
to have many
 

2253
00:36:43,440 --> 00:36:45,270
to have many
um i don't know which is better security

2254
00:36:45,270 --> 00:36:45,280
um i don't know which is better security
 

2255
00:36:45,280 --> 00:36:47,990
um i don't know which is better security

00:36:53,670 --> 00:36:53,680
have to ask a security question actually
 

2263
00:36:53,680 --> 00:36:55,510
have to ask a security question actually
well how does flooding the world with

completely destroy the trust in all my
 

2271
00:37:01,920 --> 00:37:03,990

relationships then right if i flood

2272
00:37:03,990 --> 00:37:04,000
relationships then right if i flood
 

2273
00:37:04,000 --> 00:37:05,109
relationships then right if i flood
because then

2274
00:37:05,109 --> 00:37:05,119
because then
 

2275
00:37:05,119 --> 00:37:07,589
because then
it's yeah that um

2276
00:37:07,589 --> 00:37:07,599
it's yeah that um
 

2277
00:37:07,599 --> 00:37:08,710
it's yeah that um
i think that one's not going to work

2278
00:37:08,710 --> 00:37:08,720
i think that one's not going to work
 

2279
00:37:08,720 --> 00:37:10,069
i think that one's not going to work
that well for you it's not going to work

2280
00:37:10,069 --> 00:37:10,079
that well for you it's not going to work
 

2281
00:37:10,079 --> 00:37:11,670
that well for you it's not going to work
that way i mean for the original

2282
00:37:11,670 --> 00:37:11,680
that way i mean for the original
 

2283
00:37:11,680 --> 00:37:13,510
that way i mean for the original
it probably fits some things like if

2284
00:37:13,510 --> 00:37:13,520
it probably fits some things like if
 

2285
00:37:13,520 --> 00:37:15,190
it probably fits some things like if
you're a public figure and you're trying

2286
00:37:15,190 --> 00:37:15,200
you're a public figure and you're trying
 

2287
00:37:15,200 --> 00:37:15,910
you're a public figure and you're trying
to

2288
00:37:15,910 --> 00:37:15,920
to
 

2289
00:37:15,920 --> 00:37:16,950
to
have

2290
00:37:16,950 --> 00:37:16,960
have
 

2291
00:37:16,960 --> 00:37:18,550
have
you know a bunch of

2292
00:37:18,550 --> 00:37:18,560
you know a bunch of
 

2293
00:37:18,560 --> 00:37:19,589
you know a bunch of
if you're trying to show up in a bunch

2294
00:37:19,589 --> 00:37:19,599
if you're trying to show up in a bunch
 

2295
00:37:19,599 --> 00:37:21,109
if you're trying to show up in a bunch
of different places in the future you'll

2296
00:37:21,109 --> 00:37:21,119
of different places in the future you'll
 

2297
00:37:21,119 --> 00:37:23,349
of different places in the future you'll
be able to do that in the metaverse um

2298
00:37:23,349 --> 00:37:23,359
be able to do that in the metaverse um
 

2299
00:37:23,359 --> 00:37:25,190
be able to do that in the metaverse um
so that kind of replication i think will

2300
00:37:25,190 --> 00:37:25,200
so that kind of replication i think will
 

2301
00:37:25,200 --> 00:37:27,270
so that kind of replication i think will
be useful but i do think you're gonna

2302
00:37:27,270 --> 00:37:27,280
be useful but i do think you're gonna
 

2303
00:37:27,280 --> 00:37:29,190
be useful but i do think you're gonna
want a notion of like

2304
00:37:29,190 --> 00:37:29,200
want a notion of like
 

2305
00:37:29,200 --> 00:37:31,430
want a notion of like
i am talking to the real one

2306
00:37:31,430 --> 00:37:31,440
i am talking to the real one
 

2307
00:37:31,440 --> 00:37:32,550
i am talking to the real one
yeah

2308
00:37:32,550 --> 00:37:32,560
yeah
 

2309
00:37:32,560 --> 00:37:34,390
yeah
yeah especially if the if the fake ones

2310
00:37:34,390 --> 00:37:34,400
yeah especially if the if the fake ones
 

2311
00:37:34,400 --> 00:37:35,990
yeah especially if the if the fake ones
start outperforming you and all your

2312
00:37:35,990 --> 00:37:36,000
start outperforming you and all your
 

2313
00:37:36,000 --> 00:37:37,750
start outperforming you and all your
private relationships and then you're

2314
00:37:37,750 --> 00:37:37,760
private relationships and then you're
 

2315
00:37:37,760 --> 00:37:39,430
private relationships and then you're
left behind i mean that's that's the

2316
00:37:39,430 --> 00:37:39,440
left behind i mean that's that's the
 

2317
00:37:39,440 --> 00:37:41,750
left behind i mean that's that's the
serious concern i have with clones again

2318
00:37:41,750 --> 00:37:41,760
serious concern i have with clones again
 

2319
00:37:41,760 --> 00:37:44,230
serious concern i have with clones again
the things i think about okay so i

2320
00:37:44,230 --> 00:37:44,240
the things i think about okay so i
 

2321
00:37:44,240 --> 00:37:48,230
the things i think about okay so i
recently got i used qnap nas storage

2322
00:37:48,230 --> 00:37:48,240
recently got i used qnap nas storage
 

2323
00:37:48,240 --> 00:37:50,150
recently got i used qnap nas storage
such as storage for video and stuff and

2324
00:37:50,150 --> 00:37:50,160
such as storage for video and stuff and
 

2325
00:37:50,160 --> 00:37:51,750
such as storage for video and stuff and
i recently got hacked it's the first

2326
00:37:51,750 --> 00:37:51,760
i recently got hacked it's the first
 

2327
00:37:51,760 --> 00:37:53,510
i recently got hacked it's the first
time for me with a with ransomware it's

2328
00:37:53,510 --> 00:37:53,520
time for me with a with ransomware it's
 

2329
00:37:53,520 --> 00:37:57,030
time for me with a with ransomware it's
not me personally it's all qnap devices

2330
00:37:57,030 --> 00:37:57,040
not me personally it's all qnap devices
 

2331
00:37:57,040 --> 00:37:58,630
not me personally it's all qnap devices
uh

2332
00:37:58,630 --> 00:37:58,640
uh
 

2333
00:37:58,640 --> 00:38:00,310
uh
so the the question that people have

2334
00:38:00,310 --> 00:38:00,320
so the the question that people have
 

2335
00:38:00,320 --> 00:38:02,790
so the the question that people have
about is about security in general

2336
00:38:02,790 --> 00:38:02,800
about is about security in general
 

2337
00:38:02,800 --> 00:38:04,310
about is about security in general
um because i was doing a lot of the

2338
00:38:04,310 --> 00:38:04,320
um because i was doing a lot of the
 

2339
00:38:04,320 --> 00:38:05,829
um because i was doing a lot of the
right things in terms of security and

2340
00:38:05,829 --> 00:38:05,839
right things in terms of security and
 

2341
00:38:05,839 --> 00:38:08,310
right things in terms of security and
nevertheless ransomware

2342
00:38:08,310 --> 00:38:08,320
nevertheless ransomware
 

2343
00:38:08,320 --> 00:38:10,950
nevertheless ransomware
basically disabled my device yeah is

2344
00:38:10,950 --> 00:38:10,960
basically disabled my device yeah is
 

2345
00:38:10,960 --> 00:38:12,230
basically disabled my device yeah is
that something you think about what are

2346
00:38:12,230 --> 00:38:12,240
that something you think about what are
 

2347
00:38:12,240 --> 00:38:13,430
that something you think about what are
what are the different steps you could

2348
00:38:13,430 --> 00:38:13,440
what are the different steps you could
 

2349
00:38:13,440 --> 00:38:15,349
what are the different steps you could
take to protect people's data on the

2350
00:38:15,349 --> 00:38:15,359
take to protect people's data on the
 

2351
00:38:15,359 --> 00:38:16,790
take to protect people's data on the
security front

2352
00:38:16,790 --> 00:38:16,800
security front
 

2353
00:38:16,800 --> 00:38:18,470
security front
i think that there's

2354
00:38:18,470 --> 00:38:18,480
i think that there's
 

2355
00:38:18,480 --> 00:38:21,430
i think that there's
different solutions for

2356
00:38:21,430 --> 00:38:21,440
different solutions for
 

2357
00:38:21,440 --> 00:38:22,950
different solutions for
in strategies where it makes sense to

2358
00:38:22,950 --> 00:38:22,960
in strategies where it makes sense to
 

2359
00:38:22,960 --> 00:38:25,109
in strategies where it makes sense to
have stuff kind of put behind a fortress

2360
00:38:25,109 --> 00:38:25,119
have stuff kind of put behind a fortress
 

2361
00:38:25,119 --> 00:38:28,230
have stuff kind of put behind a fortress
right so the centralized model versus

2362
00:38:28,230 --> 00:38:28,240
right so the centralized model versus
 

2363
00:38:28,240 --> 00:38:30,950
right so the centralized model versus
um decentralizing then i think both have

2364
00:38:30,950 --> 00:38:30,960
um decentralizing then i think both have
 

2365
00:38:30,960 --> 00:38:32,230
um decentralizing then i think both have
strengths and weaknesses so i think

2366
00:38:32,230 --> 00:38:32,240
strengths and weaknesses so i think
 

2367
00:38:32,240 --> 00:38:34,150
strengths and weaknesses so i think
anyone who says okay just decentralize

2368
00:38:34,150 --> 00:38:34,160
anyone who says okay just decentralize
 

2369
00:38:34,160 --> 00:38:36,710
anyone who says okay just decentralize
everything that'll make it more secure i

2370
00:38:36,710 --> 00:38:36,720
everything that'll make it more secure i
 

2371
00:38:36,720 --> 00:38:38,710
everything that'll make it more secure i
i think that that's tough because you

2372
00:38:38,710 --> 00:38:38,720
i think that that's tough because you
 

2373
00:38:38,720 --> 00:38:40,310
i think that that's tough because you
know i mean the advantage of something

2374
00:38:40,310 --> 00:38:40,320
know i mean the advantage of something
 

2375
00:38:40,320 --> 00:38:43,589
know i mean the advantage of something
like you know encryption is that

2376
00:38:43,589 --> 00:38:43,599
like you know encryption is that
 

2377
00:38:43,599 --> 00:38:44,390
like you know encryption is that
you know

2378
00:38:44,390 --> 00:38:44,400
you know
 

2379
00:38:44,400 --> 00:38:46,310
you know
we run the largest encrypted service in

2380
00:38:46,310 --> 00:38:46,320
we run the largest encrypted service in
 

2381
00:38:46,320 --> 00:38:48,150
we run the largest encrypted service in
the world with whatsapp and you know

2382
00:38:48,150 --> 00:38:48,160
the world with whatsapp and you know
 

2383
00:38:48,160 --> 00:38:49,589
the world with whatsapp and you know
we're one of the first to roll out a

2384
00:38:49,589 --> 00:38:49,599
we're one of the first to roll out a
 

2385
00:38:49,599 --> 00:38:51,430
we're one of the first to roll out a
multi-platform encryption

2386
00:38:51,430 --> 00:38:51,440
multi-platform encryption
 

2387
00:38:51,440 --> 00:38:53,829
multi-platform encryption
um service and that's you know something

2388
00:38:53,829 --> 00:38:53,839
um service and that's you know something
 

2389
00:38:53,839 --> 00:38:54,710
um service and that's you know something
that

2390
00:38:54,710 --> 00:38:54,720
that
 

2391
00:38:54,720 --> 00:38:56,069
that
i think was a big advance for the

2392
00:38:56,069 --> 00:38:56,079
i think was a big advance for the
 

2393
00:38:56,079 --> 00:38:58,310
i think was a big advance for the
industry and one of the promises that we

2394
00:38:58,310 --> 00:38:58,320
industry and one of the promises that we
 

2395
00:38:58,320 --> 00:39:00,470
industry and one of the promises that we
can basically make because of that our

2396
00:39:00,470 --> 00:39:00,480
can basically make because of that our
 

2397
00:39:00,480 --> 00:39:02,310
can basically make because of that our
company doesn't see

2398
00:39:02,310 --> 00:39:02,320
company doesn't see
 

2399
00:39:02,320 --> 00:39:04,630
company doesn't see
when you're sending an encrypted message

2400
00:39:04,630 --> 00:39:04,640
when you're sending an encrypted message
 

2401
00:39:04,640 --> 00:39:05,990
when you're sending an encrypted message
and an encrypted message what the

2402
00:39:05,990 --> 00:39:06,000
and an encrypted message what the
 

2403
00:39:06,000 --> 00:39:07,430
and an encrypted message what the
content is of what you're what you're

2404
00:39:07,430 --> 00:39:07,440
content is of what you're what you're
 

2405
00:39:07,440 --> 00:39:09,270
content is of what you're what you're
sharing so that way if someone hacks

2406
00:39:09,270 --> 00:39:09,280
sharing so that way if someone hacks
 

2407
00:39:09,280 --> 00:39:11,430
sharing so that way if someone hacks
meta servers

2408
00:39:11,430 --> 00:39:11,440
meta servers
 

2409
00:39:11,440 --> 00:39:13,349
meta servers
they're not going to be able to access

2410
00:39:13,349 --> 00:39:13,359
they're not going to be able to access
 

2411
00:39:13,359 --> 00:39:15,190
they're not going to be able to access
you know the whatsapp message that you

2412
00:39:15,190 --> 00:39:15,200
you know the whatsapp message that you
 

2413
00:39:15,200 --> 00:39:17,510
you know the whatsapp message that you
know you're sending to your friend and

2414
00:39:17,510 --> 00:39:17,520
know you're sending to your friend and
 

2415
00:39:17,520 --> 00:39:19,030
know you're sending to your friend and
that i think matters a lot to people

2416
00:39:19,030 --> 00:39:19,040
that i think matters a lot to people
 

2417
00:39:19,040 --> 00:39:21,109
that i think matters a lot to people
because um obviously if someone is able

2418
00:39:21,109 --> 00:39:21,119
because um obviously if someone is able
 

2419
00:39:21,119 --> 00:39:22,790
because um obviously if someone is able
to compromise a company's servers and

2420
00:39:22,790 --> 00:39:22,800
to compromise a company's servers and
 

2421
00:39:22,800 --> 00:39:24,310
to compromise a company's servers and
that company has hundreds of millions or

2422
00:39:24,310 --> 00:39:24,320
that company has hundreds of millions or
 

2423
00:39:24,320 --> 00:39:25,990
that company has hundreds of millions or
billions of people then that's that ends

2424
00:39:25,990 --> 00:39:26,000
billions of people then that's that ends
 

2425
00:39:26,000 --> 00:39:27,750
billions of people then that's that ends
up being a very big deal

2426
00:39:27,750 --> 00:39:27,760
up being a very big deal
 

2427
00:39:27,760 --> 00:39:29,510
up being a very big deal
the flip side of that is okay all the

2428
00:39:29,510 --> 00:39:29,520
the flip side of that is okay all the
 

2429
00:39:29,520 --> 00:39:31,270
the flip side of that is okay all the
content is on your phone

2430
00:39:31,270 --> 00:39:31,280
content is on your phone
 

2431
00:39:31,280 --> 00:39:32,310
content is on your phone
um

2432
00:39:32,310 --> 00:39:32,320
um
 

2433
00:39:32,320 --> 00:39:34,150
um
you know are you following security best

2434
00:39:34,150 --> 00:39:34,160
you know are you following security best
 

2435
00:39:34,160 --> 00:39:36,310
you know are you following security best
practices on your phone if you lose your

2436
00:39:36,310 --> 00:39:36,320
practices on your phone if you lose your
 

2437
00:39:36,320 --> 00:39:38,470
practices on your phone if you lose your
phone all your content is gone so that's

2438
00:39:38,470 --> 00:39:38,480
phone all your content is gone so that's
 

2439
00:39:38,480 --> 00:39:40,470
phone all your content is gone so that's
an issue you know maybe you go back up

2440
00:39:40,470 --> 00:39:40,480
an issue you know maybe you go back up
 

2441
00:39:40,480 --> 00:39:42,950
an issue you know maybe you go back up
your content from whatsapp or or some

2442
00:39:42,950 --> 00:39:42,960
your content from whatsapp or or some
 

2443
00:39:42,960 --> 00:39:45,670
your content from whatsapp or or some
other service in an icloud or something

2444
00:39:45,670 --> 00:39:45,680
other service in an icloud or something
 

2445
00:39:45,680 --> 00:39:47,589
other service in an icloud or something
but then you're just at apple's whims

2446
00:39:47,589 --> 00:39:47,599
but then you're just at apple's whims
 

2447
00:39:47,599 --> 00:39:48,870
but then you're just at apple's whims
about are they going to go turn over the

2448
00:39:48,870 --> 00:39:48,880
about are they going to go turn over the
 

2449
00:39:48,880 --> 00:39:51,190
about are they going to go turn over the
government the the data to you know some

2450
00:39:51,190 --> 00:39:51,200
government the the data to you know some
 

2451
00:39:51,200 --> 00:39:52,870
government the the data to you know some
government or or are they going to get

2452
00:39:52,870 --> 00:39:52,880
government or or are they going to get
 

2453
00:39:52,880 --> 00:39:55,670
government or or are they going to get
hacked so a lot of the time it is useful

2454
00:39:55,670 --> 00:39:55,680
hacked so a lot of the time it is useful
 

2455
00:39:55,680 --> 00:39:56,870
hacked so a lot of the time it is useful
to have

2456
00:39:56,870 --> 00:39:56,880
to have
 

2457
00:39:56,880 --> 00:39:59,510
to have
data in a centralized place too because

2458
00:39:59,510 --> 00:39:59,520
data in a centralized place too because
 

2459
00:39:59,520 --> 00:40:02,310
data in a centralized place too because
then you can train systems that um that

2460
00:40:02,310 --> 00:40:02,320
then you can train systems that um that
 

2461
00:40:02,320 --> 00:40:04,630
then you can train systems that um that
can just do much better personalization

2462
00:40:04,630 --> 00:40:04,640
can just do much better personalization
 

2463
00:40:04,640 --> 00:40:07,270
can just do much better personalization
i think that in a lot of cases um you

2464
00:40:07,270 --> 00:40:07,280
i think that in a lot of cases um you
 

2465
00:40:07,280 --> 00:40:09,750
i think that in a lot of cases um you
know centralized systems can can offer

2466
00:40:09,750 --> 00:40:09,760
know centralized systems can can offer
 

2467
00:40:09,760 --> 00:40:11,349
know centralized systems can can offer
you know especially if you're

2468
00:40:11,349 --> 00:40:11,359
you know especially if you're
 

2469
00:40:11,359 --> 00:40:13,349
you know especially if you're
if you're a you know serious company

2470
00:40:13,349 --> 00:40:13,359
if you're a you know serious company
 

2471
00:40:13,359 --> 00:40:14,470
if you're a you know serious company
you're you're

2472
00:40:14,470 --> 00:40:14,480
you're you're
 

2473
00:40:14,480 --> 00:40:16,390
you're you're
running the state-of-the-art stuff and

2474
00:40:16,390 --> 00:40:16,400
running the state-of-the-art stuff and
 

2475
00:40:16,400 --> 00:40:18,550
running the state-of-the-art stuff and
um and you have red teams attacking your

2476
00:40:18,550 --> 00:40:18,560
um and you have red teams attacking your
 

2477
00:40:18,560 --> 00:40:21,589
um and you have red teams attacking your
your own stuff and um and

2478
00:40:21,589 --> 00:40:21,599
your own stuff and um and
 

2479
00:40:21,599 --> 00:40:24,150
your own stuff and um and
you're putting out bounty programs and

2480
00:40:24,150 --> 00:40:24,160
you're putting out bounty programs and
 

2481
00:40:24,160 --> 00:40:25,349
you're putting out bounty programs and
trying to attract some of the best

2482
00:40:25,349 --> 00:40:25,359
trying to attract some of the best
 

2483
00:40:25,359 --> 00:40:26,710
trying to attract some of the best
hackers in the world to go break into

2484
00:40:26,710 --> 00:40:26,720
hackers in the world to go break into
 

2485
00:40:26,720 --> 00:40:29,030
hackers in the world to go break into
your stuff all the time so any system is

2486
00:40:29,030 --> 00:40:29,040
your stuff all the time so any system is
 

2487
00:40:29,040 --> 00:40:31,430
your stuff all the time so any system is
going to have security issues but um but

2488
00:40:31,430 --> 00:40:31,440
going to have security issues but um but
 

2489
00:40:31,440 --> 00:40:32,230
going to have security issues but um but
i think

2490
00:40:32,230 --> 00:40:32,240
i think
 

2491
00:40:32,240 --> 00:40:34,230
i think
the best way forward is to basically try

2492
00:40:34,230 --> 00:40:34,240
the best way forward is to basically try
 

2493
00:40:34,240 --> 00:40:35,910
the best way forward is to basically try
to be as aggressive and open about

2494
00:40:35,910 --> 00:40:35,920
to be as aggressive and open about
 

2495
00:40:35,920 --> 00:40:37,670
to be as aggressive and open about
hardening the systems as possible not

2496
00:40:37,670 --> 00:40:37,680
hardening the systems as possible not
 

2497
00:40:37,680 --> 00:40:39,510
hardening the systems as possible not
trying to kind of hide and pretend that

2498
00:40:39,510 --> 00:40:39,520
trying to kind of hide and pretend that
 

2499
00:40:39,520 --> 00:40:40,790
trying to kind of hide and pretend that
there aren't going to be issues which i

2500
00:40:40,790 --> 00:40:40,800
there aren't going to be issues which i
 

2501
00:40:40,800 --> 00:40:42,470
there aren't going to be issues which i
think is over time why

2502
00:40:42,470 --> 00:40:42,480
think is over time why
 

2503
00:40:42,480 --> 00:40:44,230
think is over time why
a lot of open source systems have gotten

2504
00:40:44,230 --> 00:40:44,240
a lot of open source systems have gotten
 

2505
00:40:44,240 --> 00:40:45,589
a lot of open source systems have gotten
relatively more secure it's because

2506
00:40:45,589 --> 00:40:45,599
relatively more secure it's because
 

2507
00:40:45,599 --> 00:40:47,030
relatively more secure it's because
they're they're open and you know it's

2508
00:40:47,030 --> 00:40:47,040
they're they're open and you know it's
 

2509
00:40:47,040 --> 00:40:48,470
they're they're open and you know it's
not rather than pretending that there

2510
00:40:48,470 --> 00:40:48,480
not rather than pretending that there
 

2511
00:40:48,480 --> 00:40:49,750
not rather than pretending that there
aren't going to be issues just people

2512
00:40:49,750 --> 00:40:49,760
aren't going to be issues just people
 

2513
00:40:49,760 --> 00:40:51,589
aren't going to be issues just people
surface them quicker so i think you want

2514
00:40:51,589 --> 00:40:51,599
surface them quicker so i think you want
 

2515
00:40:51,599 --> 00:40:53,829
surface them quicker so i think you want
to adopt that approach as a company and

2516
00:40:53,829 --> 00:40:53,839
to adopt that approach as a company and
 

2517
00:40:53,839 --> 00:40:55,670
to adopt that approach as a company and
and just constantly be hardening your

2518
00:40:55,670 --> 00:40:55,680
and just constantly be hardening your
 

2519
00:40:55,680 --> 00:40:58,069
and just constantly be hardening your
yourself trying to uh stay one step

2520
00:40:58,069 --> 00:40:58,079
yourself trying to uh stay one step
 

2521
00:40:58,079 --> 00:41:00,950
yourself trying to uh stay one step
ahead of the attackers

2522
00:41:00,950 --> 00:41:00,960
ahead of the attackers
 

2523
00:41:00,960 --> 00:41:02,630
ahead of the attackers
it's it's an inherently adversarial

2524
00:41:02,630 --> 00:41:02,640
it's it's an inherently adversarial
 

2525
00:41:02,640 --> 00:41:04,390
it's it's an inherently adversarial
space yeah but i think it's an

2526
00:41:04,390 --> 00:41:04,400
space yeah but i think it's an
 

2527
00:41:04,400 --> 00:41:06,550
space yeah but i think it's an
interesting security is

2528
00:41:06,550 --> 00:41:06,560
interesting security is
 

2529
00:41:06,560 --> 00:41:08,309
interesting security is
interesting because of of the different

2530
00:41:08,309 --> 00:41:08,319
interesting because of of the different
 

2531
00:41:08,319 --> 00:41:10,150
interesting because of of the different
kind of threats that we've managed over

2532
00:41:10,150 --> 00:41:10,160
kind of threats that we've managed over
 

2533
00:41:10,160 --> 00:41:11,109
kind of threats that we've managed over
the last

2534
00:41:11,109 --> 00:41:11,119
the last
 

2535
00:41:11,119 --> 00:41:12,950
the last
five years there are ones um

2536
00:41:12,950 --> 00:41:12,960
five years there are ones um
 

2537
00:41:12,960 --> 00:41:14,230
five years there are ones um

where basically the adversaries keep on

2540
00:41:15,670 --> 00:41:15,680
where basically the adversaries keep on
 

2541
00:41:15,680 --> 00:41:18,309
where basically the adversaries keep on
getting better and better so trying to

2542
00:41:18,309 --> 00:41:18,319
getting better and better so trying to
 

2543
00:41:18,319 --> 00:41:21,030
getting better and better so trying to
kind of interfere with um you know

2544
00:41:21,030 --> 00:41:21,040
kind of interfere with um you know
 

2545
00:41:21,040 --> 00:41:22,950
kind of interfere with um you know
security is certainly one area of this

2546
00:41:22,950 --> 00:41:22,960
security is certainly one area of this
 

2547
00:41:22,960 --> 00:41:24,470
security is certainly one area of this
if you have like nation states that are

2548
00:41:24,470 --> 00:41:24,480
if you have like nation states that are
 

2549
00:41:24,480 --> 00:41:25,910
if you have like nation states that are
trying to you know interfere in

2550
00:41:25,910 --> 00:41:25,920
trying to you know interfere in
 

2551
00:41:25,920 --> 00:41:27,670
trying to you know interfere in
elections or something like they're kind

2552
00:41:27,670 --> 00:41:27,680
elections or something like they're kind
 

2553
00:41:27,680 --> 00:41:29,910
elections or something like they're kind
of evolving their tactics whereas on the

2554
00:41:29,910 --> 00:41:29,920
of evolving their tactics whereas on the
 

2555
00:41:29,920 --> 00:41:31,190
of evolving their tactics whereas on the
other hand

2556
00:41:31,190 --> 00:41:31,200
other hand
 

2557
00:41:31,200 --> 00:41:32,630
other hand
i don't want to be too too simplistic

2558
00:41:32,630 --> 00:41:32,640
i don't want to be too too simplistic
 

2559
00:41:32,640 --> 00:41:35,190
i don't want to be too too simplistic
about it but like if um you know if

2560
00:41:35,190 --> 00:41:35,200
about it but like if um you know if

and i think that they make a few
assumptions that are

2640
00:43:02,950 --> 00:43:02,960
assumptions that are
 

2641

um
 

2643
00:43:04,480 --> 00:43:07,349
um
just very big jumps that i i don't think

2644
00:43:07,349 --> 00:43:07,359
just very big jumps that i i don't think
 

2645
00:43:07,359 --> 00:43:09,510
just very big jumps that i i don't think
are reasonable to make but

2661
00:43:24,560 --> 00:43:27,109
service more in general right so as a

kind of basic assumption okay do we have
 

2663
00:43:27,119 --> 00:43:29,030
kind of basic assumption okay do we have
an incentive for people to to build a

2664
00:43:29,030 --> 00:43:29,040
an incentive for people to to build a
 

2665
00:43:29,040 --> 00:43:31,589
an incentive for people to to build a
service that people use more

2666
00:43:31,589 --> 00:43:31,599
service that people use more
 

2667
00:43:31,599 --> 00:43:33,270

yes on a lot of levels i mean we we

2668
00:43:33,270 --> 00:43:33,280
yes on a lot of levels i mean we we
 

2669
00:43:33,280 --> 00:43:35,270
yes on a lot of levels i mean we we
think what we're doing is good so you

2670
00:43:35,270 --> 00:43:35,280
think what we're doing is good so you
 

2671
00:43:35,280 --> 00:43:36,630
think what we're doing is good so you
know we think that if people are finding

2672
00:43:36,630 --> 00:43:36,640
know we think that if people are finding
 

2673
00:43:36,640 --> 00:43:38,470
know we think that if people are finding
it useful they'll use it more

2674
00:43:38,470 --> 00:43:38,480
it useful they'll use it more
 

2675
00:43:38,480 --> 00:43:40,790
it useful they'll use it more
or if you just look at it as this

2676
00:43:40,790 --> 00:43:40,800
or if you just look at it as this
 

2677
00:43:40,800 --> 00:43:42,710
or if you just look at it as this
sort of if the only thing we cared about

2678
00:43:42,710 --> 00:43:42,720
sort of if the only thing we cared about
 

2679
00:43:42,720 --> 00:43:45,589
sort of if the only thing we cared about
is money which i i is is not for anyone

2680
00:43:45,589 --> 00:43:45,599
is money which i i is is not for anyone
 

2681
00:43:45,599 --> 00:43:47,910
is money which i i is is not for anyone
who knows me but okay we're a company so

2682
00:43:47,910 --> 00:43:47,920
who knows me but okay we're a company so
 

2683
00:43:47,920 --> 00:43:50,230
who knows me but okay we're a company so
let's say you just kind of um simplified

2684
00:43:50,230 --> 00:43:50,240
let's say you just kind of um simplified
 

2685
00:43:50,240 --> 00:43:51,990
let's say you just kind of um simplified
it down to that then would we want

2686
00:43:51,990 --> 00:43:52,000
it down to that then would we want
 

2687
00:43:52,000 --> 00:43:54,790
it down to that then would we want
people to use the services more yes

2688
00:43:54,790 --> 00:43:54,800
people to use the services more yes
 

2689
00:43:54,800 --> 00:43:56,870
people to use the services more yes
but then and then you get to the second

2690
00:43:56,870 --> 00:43:56,880
but then and then you get to the second
 

2691
00:43:56,880 --> 00:43:59,750
but then and then you get to the second
question which is

2692
00:43:59,750 --> 00:43:59,760

 

2693
00:43:59,760 --> 00:44:02,950

does kind of getting people agitated

2694
00:44:02,950 --> 00:44:02,960
does kind of getting people agitated
 

2695
00:44:02,960 --> 00:44:05,750
does kind of getting people agitated
make them more likely to use

2696
00:44:05,750 --> 00:44:05,760
make them more likely to use
 

2697
00:44:05,760 --> 00:44:07,430
make them more likely to use
the services more

2698
00:44:07,430 --> 00:44:07,440
the services more
 

2699
00:44:07,440 --> 00:44:09,109
the services more
and

2700
00:44:09,109 --> 00:44:09,119
and
 

2701
00:44:09,119 --> 00:44:11,109
and
i think from looking at other media in

2702
00:44:11,109 --> 00:44:11,119
i think from looking at other media in
 

2703
00:44:11,119 --> 00:44:12,630
i think from looking at other media in
the world

2704
00:44:12,630 --> 00:44:12,640
the world
 

2705
00:44:12,640 --> 00:44:15,510
the world
especially tv and you know there's the

2706
00:44:15,510 --> 00:44:15,520
especially tv and you know there's the
 

2707
00:44:15,520 --> 00:44:18,470
especially tv and you know there's the
old news adage if it bleeds it leads

2708
00:44:18,470 --> 00:44:18,480
old news adage if it bleeds it leads
 

2709
00:44:18,480 --> 00:44:21,030
old news adage if it bleeds it leads
like i think that this is there are

2710
00:44:21,030 --> 00:44:21,040
like i think that this is there are
 

2711
00:44:21,040 --> 00:44:23,510
like i think that this is there are
i think there are a bunch of

2712
00:44:23,510 --> 00:44:23,520
i think there are a bunch of
 

2713
00:44:23,520 --> 00:44:26,630
i think there are a bunch of
reasons why someone might think that

2714
00:44:26,630 --> 00:44:26,640
reasons why someone might think that
 

2715
00:44:26,640 --> 00:44:27,670
reasons why someone might think that
um

2716
00:44:27,670 --> 00:44:27,680
um
 

2717
00:44:27,680 --> 00:44:30,390
um
that kind of provocative content

2718
00:44:30,390 --> 00:44:30,400
that kind of provocative content
 

2719
00:44:30,400 --> 00:44:32,470
that kind of provocative content
would be the most engaging

2720
00:44:32,470 --> 00:44:32,480
would be the most engaging
 

2721
00:44:32,480 --> 00:44:34,870
would be the most engaging
now what i've always found is is two

2722
00:44:34,870 --> 00:44:34,880
now what i've always found is is two
 

2723
00:44:34,880 --> 00:44:37,190
now what i've always found is is two
things one is that will grab someone's

2724
00:44:37,190 --> 00:44:37,200
things one is that will grab someone's
 

2725
00:44:37,200 --> 00:44:39,109
things one is that will grab someone's
attention in the near term

2726
00:44:39,109 --> 00:44:39,119
attention in the near term
 

2727
00:44:39,119 --> 00:44:40,790
attention in the near term
is not necessarily something that

2728
00:44:40,790 --> 00:44:40,800
is not necessarily something that
 

2729
00:44:40,800 --> 00:44:43,109
is not necessarily something that
they're going to appreciate having seen

2730
00:44:43,109 --> 00:44:43,119
they're going to appreciate having seen
 

2731
00:44:43,119 --> 00:44:44,870
they're going to appreciate having seen
um or going to be the best over the long

2732
00:44:44,870 --> 00:44:44,880
um or going to be the best over the long
 

2733
00:44:44,880 --> 00:44:46,069
um or going to be the best over the long
term so i think what what a lot of

2734
00:44:46,069 --> 00:44:46,079
term so i think what what a lot of
 

2735
00:44:46,079 --> 00:44:47,349
term so i think what what a lot of
people get wrong

2736
00:44:47,349 --> 00:44:47,359
people get wrong
 

2737
00:44:47,359 --> 00:44:48,230
people get wrong
is that

2738
00:44:48,230 --> 00:44:48,240
is that
 

2739
00:44:48,240 --> 00:44:50,230
is that
we're not i'm not building this company

2740
00:44:50,230 --> 00:44:50,240
we're not i'm not building this company
 

2741
00:44:50,240 --> 00:44:52,069
we're not i'm not building this company

00:44:53,510 --> 00:44:53,520
people to spend the most time on this in
 

2745
00:44:53,520 --> 00:44:55,430
people to spend the most time on this in
the next quarter or the next year right

2746
00:44:55,430 --> 00:44:55,440
the next quarter or the next year right
 

2747
00:44:55,440 --> 00:44:56,950
the next quarter or the next year right
i mean i've been doing this for

2748
00:44:56,950 --> 00:44:56,960
i mean i've been doing this for
 

2749
00:44:56,960 --> 00:44:59,190
i mean i've been doing this for
you know 17 years at this point and i'm

2750
00:44:59,190 --> 00:44:59,200
you know 17 years at this point and i'm
 

2751
00:44:59,200 --> 00:45:00,950
you know 17 years at this point and i'm
still relatively young and you have a

2752
00:45:00,950 --> 00:45:00,960
still relatively young and you have a
 

2753
00:45:00,960 --> 00:45:02,390
still relatively young and you have a
lot more that i want to do over the

2754
00:45:02,390 --> 00:45:02,400
lot more that i want to do over the
 

2755
00:45:02,400 --> 00:45:04,710
lot more that i want to do over the
coming decades so like

2756
00:45:04,710 --> 00:45:04,720
coming decades so like
 

2757
00:45:04,720 --> 00:45:08,230
coming decades so like
i think that it's too simplistic to say

2758
00:45:08,230 --> 00:45:08,240
i think that it's too simplistic to say
 

2759
00:45:08,240 --> 00:45:09,270
i think that it's too simplistic to say
hey

2760
00:45:09,270 --> 00:45:09,280
hey
 

2761
00:45:09,280 --> 00:45:11,349
hey
this might increase time in the near

2762
00:45:11,349 --> 00:45:11,359
this might increase time in the near
 

2763
00:45:11,359 --> 00:45:12,710
this might increase time in the near
term therefore it's what you're going to

2764
00:45:12,710 --> 00:45:12,720
term therefore it's what you're going to
 

2765
00:45:12,720 --> 00:45:14,950
term therefore it's what you're going to
do because i actually think a a deeper

2766
00:45:14,950 --> 00:45:14,960
do because i actually think a a deeper
 

2767
00:45:14,960 --> 00:45:17,030
do because i actually think a a deeper
look at kind of what my incentives are

2768
00:45:17,030 --> 00:45:17,040
look at kind of what my incentives are
 

2769
00:45:17,040 --> 00:45:18,390
look at kind of what my incentives are
the incentives of a company that are

2770
00:45:18,390 --> 00:45:18,400
the incentives of a company that are
 

2771
00:45:18,400 --> 00:45:20,390
the incentives of a company that are
focused on the long term

2772
00:45:20,390 --> 00:45:20,400
focused on the long term
 

2773
00:45:20,400 --> 00:45:21,589
focused on the long term
is to

2774
00:45:21,589 --> 00:45:21,599
is to
 

2775
00:45:21,599 --> 00:45:22,790
is to
basically do what people are going to

2776
00:45:22,790 --> 00:45:22,800
basically do what people are going to
 

2777
00:45:22,800 --> 00:45:24,470
basically do what people are going to
find valuable over time not what is

2778
00:45:24,470 --> 00:45:24,480
find valuable over time not what is
 

2779
00:45:24,480 --> 00:45:26,630
find valuable over time not what is
going to draw people's attention today

2780
00:45:26,630 --> 00:45:26,640
going to draw people's attention today
 

2781
00:45:26,640 --> 00:45:29,750
going to draw people's attention today
the other thing that i'd say is that

2782
00:45:29,750 --> 00:45:29,760
the other thing that i'd say is that
 

2783
00:45:29,760 --> 00:45:31,109
the other thing that i'd say is that
i think a lot of times people look at

2784
00:45:31,109 --> 00:45:31,119
i think a lot of times people look at
 

2785
00:45:31,119 --> 00:45:33,589
i think a lot of times people look at
this from the perspective of media

2786
00:45:33,589 --> 00:45:33,599
this from the perspective of media

at this

2794
00:45:40,150 --> 00:45:40,160

to connect and and feel good over over a
 

2879
00:46:58,079 --> 00:47:00,710
to connect and and feel good over over a
long period of time then that's um you

2880
00:47:00,710 --> 00:47:00,720
long period of time then that's um you
 

2881
00:47:00,720 --> 00:47:01,990
long period of time then that's um you
know naturally what you're going to do

2882
00:47:01,990 --> 00:47:02,000
know naturally what you're going to do
 

2883
00:47:02,000 --> 00:47:04,870
know naturally what you're going to do
so i don't know i think overall

2884
00:47:04,870 --> 00:47:04,880
so i don't know i think overall
 

2885
00:47:04,880 --> 00:47:06,390
so i don't know i think overall
i um

2886
00:47:06,390 --> 00:47:06,400
i um
 

2887
00:47:06,400 --> 00:47:08,390
i um
i understand

2888
00:47:08,390 --> 00:47:08,400
i understand
 

2889
00:47:08,400 --> 00:47:10,390
i understand
at a high level

2890
00:47:10,390 --> 00:47:10,400
at a high level
 

2891
00:47:10,400 --> 00:47:12,309
at a high level
if you're not thinking

2892
00:47:12,309 --> 00:47:12,319
if you're not thinking
 

2893
00:47:12,319 --> 00:47:14,470
if you're not thinking
too deeply about it why that argument

2894
00:47:14,470 --> 00:47:14,480
too deeply about it why that argument
 

2895
00:47:14,480 --> 00:47:16,150
too deeply about it why that argument
might be appealing

2896
00:47:16,150 --> 00:47:16,160
might be appealing
 

2897
00:47:16,160 --> 00:47:17,589
might be appealing
but

2898
00:47:17,589 --> 00:47:17,599
but
 

2899
00:47:17,599 --> 00:47:19,109
but
i just think if you actually look at

2900
00:47:19,109 --> 00:47:19,119
i just think if you actually look at
 

2901
00:47:19,119 --> 00:47:21,270
i just think if you actually look at
what our real incentives are not just

2902
00:47:21,270 --> 00:47:21,280
what our real incentives are not just
 

2903
00:47:21,280 --> 00:47:22,390
what our real incentives are not just
like

2904
00:47:22,390 --> 00:47:22,400
like
 

2905
00:47:22,400 --> 00:47:23,750
like
you know is

2906
00:47:23,750 --> 00:47:23,760
you know is
 

2907
00:47:23,760 --> 00:47:25,109
you know is
if we were trying to optimize for the

2908
00:47:25,109 --> 00:47:25,119
if we were trying to optimize for the
 

2909
00:47:25,119 --> 00:47:28,390
if we were trying to optimize for the
next week um but like as people working

2910
00:47:28,390 --> 00:47:28,400
next week um but like as people working
 

2911
00:47:28,400 --> 00:47:31,510
next week um but like as people working
on this like why are we here and

2912
00:47:31,510 --> 00:47:31,520
on this like why are we here and
 

2913
00:47:31,520 --> 00:47:33,190
on this like why are we here and
i i think it's pretty clear that's not

2914
00:47:33,190 --> 00:47:33,200
i i think it's pretty clear that's not
 

2915
00:47:33,200 --> 00:47:34,470
i i think it's pretty clear that's not
actually how you would want to design

2916
00:47:34,470 --> 00:47:34,480
actually how you would want to design
 

2917
00:47:34,480 --> 00:47:36,390
actually how you would want to design
the system i guess one other thing that

2918
00:47:36,390 --> 00:47:36,400
the system i guess one other thing that
 

2919
00:47:36,400 --> 00:47:37,910
the system i guess one other thing that
i'd say is that you know while we're

2920
00:47:37,910 --> 00:47:37,920
i'd say is that you know while we're
 

2921
00:47:37,920 --> 00:47:40,630
i'd say is that you know while we're
focused on the the ads business model

2922
00:47:40,630 --> 00:47:40,640
focused on the the ads business model
 

2923
00:47:40,640 --> 00:47:42,950
focused on the the ads business model
i i do think it's important to note that

2924
00:47:42,950 --> 00:47:42,960
i i do think it's important to note that
 

2925
00:47:42,960 --> 00:47:44,790
i i do think it's important to note that
a lot of these issues are not unique to

2926
00:47:44,790 --> 00:47:44,800
a lot of these issues are not unique to
 

2927
00:47:44,800 --> 00:47:46,710
a lot of these issues are not unique to
ads i mean so take like a subscription

2928
00:47:46,710 --> 00:47:46,720
ads i mean so take like a subscription
 

2929
00:47:46,720 --> 00:47:48,870
ads i mean so take like a subscription
news business model for example

2930
00:47:48,870 --> 00:47:48,880
news business model for example
 

2931
00:47:48,880 --> 00:47:50,790
news business model for example
i think that has you know just as many

2932
00:47:50,790 --> 00:47:50,800
i think that has you know just as many
 

2933
00:47:50,800 --> 00:47:53,349
i think that has you know just as many
potential pitfalls um you know maybe if

2934
00:47:53,349 --> 00:47:53,359
potential pitfalls um you know maybe if
 

2935
00:47:53,359 --> 00:47:55,190
potential pitfalls um you know maybe if
someone's paying for a subscription you

2936
00:47:55,190 --> 00:47:55,200
someone's paying for a subscription you
 

2937
00:47:55,200 --> 00:47:56,790
someone's paying for a subscription you
don't get paid per piece of content that

2938
00:47:56,790 --> 00:47:56,800
don't get paid per piece of content that
 

2939
00:47:56,800 --> 00:47:58,710
don't get paid per piece of content that
they look at but

2940
00:47:58,710 --> 00:47:58,720
they look at but
 

2941
00:47:58,720 --> 00:48:01,750
they look at but
you know say for example i i think like

2942
00:48:01,750 --> 00:48:01,760
you know say for example i i think like
 

2943
00:48:01,760 --> 00:48:05,190
you know say for example i i think like
a bunch of the partisanship that we see

2944
00:48:05,190 --> 00:48:05,200
a bunch of the partisanship that we see
 

2945
00:48:05,200 --> 00:48:08,470
a bunch of the partisanship that we see
could potentially be made worse by

2946
00:48:08,470 --> 00:48:08,480
could potentially be made worse by
 

2947
00:48:08,480 --> 00:48:11,030
could potentially be made worse by
you have these these kind of partisan

2948
00:48:11,030 --> 00:48:11,040
you have these these kind of partisan
 

2949
00:48:11,040 --> 00:48:12,549
you have these these kind of partisan
um

2950
00:48:12,549 --> 00:48:12,559
um
 

2951
00:48:12,559 --> 00:48:14,470
um
news organizations that basically sell

2952
00:48:14,470 --> 00:48:14,480
news organizations that basically sell
 

2953
00:48:14,480 --> 00:48:16,230
news organizations that basically sell
subscriptions and they're only going to

2954
00:48:16,230 --> 00:48:16,240
subscriptions and they're only going to
 

2955
00:48:16,240 --> 00:48:17,990
subscriptions and they're only going to
get people on one side to basically

2956
00:48:17,990 --> 00:48:18,000
get people on one side to basically
 

2957
00:48:18,000 --> 00:48:19,750
get people on one side to basically
subscribe to them

2958
00:48:19,750 --> 00:48:19,760
subscribe to them
 

2959
00:48:19,760 --> 00:48:22,069
subscribe to them
so their incentive is not to um print

2960
00:48:22,069 --> 00:48:22,079
so their incentive is not to um print
 

2961
00:48:22,079 --> 00:48:24,950
so their incentive is not to um print
content or or or produce content that's

2962
00:48:24,950 --> 00:48:24,960
content or or or produce content that's
 

2963
00:48:24,960 --> 00:48:27,349
content or or or produce content that's
kind of centrist or down the line either

2964
00:48:27,349 --> 00:48:27,359
kind of centrist or down the line either
 

2965
00:48:27,359 --> 00:48:29,430
kind of centrist or down the line either
um i bet that what a lot of them find is

2966
00:48:29,430 --> 00:48:29,440
um i bet that what a lot of them find is
 

2967
00:48:29,440 --> 00:48:31,190
um i bet that what a lot of them find is
that if they produce stuff that's that's

2968
00:48:31,190 --> 00:48:31,200
that if they produce stuff that's that's
 

2969
00:48:31,200 --> 00:48:33,589
that if they produce stuff that's that's
kind of more polarizing or more partisan

2970
00:48:33,589 --> 00:48:33,599
kind of more polarizing or more partisan
 

2971
00:48:33,599 --> 00:48:35,589
kind of more polarizing or more partisan
then um then that is what gets them more

2972
00:48:35,589 --> 00:48:35,599
then um then that is what gets them more
 

2973
00:48:35,599 --> 00:48:37,589
then um then that is what gets them more
subscribers so

2974
00:48:37,589 --> 00:48:37,599
subscribers so
 

2975
00:48:37,599 --> 00:48:39,670
subscribers so
i i think that this stuff is all

2976
00:48:39,670 --> 00:48:39,680
i i think that this stuff is all
 

2977
00:48:39,680 --> 00:48:41,829
i i think that this stuff is all
um there's no perfect business model

2978
00:48:41,829 --> 00:48:41,839
um there's no perfect business model
 

2979
00:48:41,839 --> 00:48:44,390
um there's no perfect business model
everything has pitfalls um the thing

2980
00:48:44,390 --> 00:48:44,400
everything has pitfalls um the thing
 

2981
00:48:44,400 --> 00:48:46,309
everything has pitfalls um the thing
that i think is great about advertising

2982
00:48:46,309 --> 00:48:46,319

have to be careful about how you're
implementing what you're doing you

3002
00:49:02,549 --> 00:49:02,559
implementing what you're doing you

people angry just because it makes more

3014
00:49:14,549 --> 00:49:14,559
people angry just because it makes more
 

3015
00:49:14,559 --> 00:49:15,910
people angry just because it makes more
money in the short term that kind of

3016
00:49:15,910 --> 00:49:15,920
money in the short term that kind of
 

3017
00:49:15,920 --> 00:49:17,829
money in the short term that kind of
thing so you responded to that but

3018
00:49:17,829 --> 00:49:17,839
thing so you responded to that but
 

3019
00:49:17,839 --> 00:49:19,829
thing so you responded to that but
there's also a kind of

3020
00:49:19,829 --> 00:49:19,839
there's also a kind of
 

3021
00:49:19,839 --> 00:49:21,910
there's also a kind of
reality of human nature

3022
00:49:21,910 --> 00:49:21,920
reality of human nature
 

3023
00:49:21,920 --> 00:49:25,270
reality of human nature
just like you spoke about there's fights

3024
00:49:25,270 --> 00:49:25,280
just like you spoke about there's fights
 

3025
00:49:25,280 --> 00:49:27,430
just like you spoke about there's fights
arguments we get in and we don't like

3026
00:49:27,430 --> 00:49:27,440
arguments we get in and we don't like
 

3027
00:49:27,440 --> 00:49:29,270
arguments we get in and we don't like
ourselves afterwards but we got into

3028
00:49:29,270 --> 00:49:29,280
ourselves afterwards but we got into
 

3029
00:49:29,280 --> 00:49:32,710
ourselves afterwards but we got into
them anyway so our long-term growth is

3030
00:49:32,710 --> 00:49:32,720
them anyway so our long-term growth is
 

3031
00:49:32,720 --> 00:49:34,870
them anyway so our long-term growth is
i i believe for most of us has to do

3032
00:49:34,870 --> 00:49:34,880
i i believe for most of us has to do
 

3033
00:49:34,880 --> 00:49:36,470
i i believe for most of us has to do
with learning

3034
00:49:36,470 --> 00:49:36,480
with learning
 

3035
00:49:36,480 --> 00:49:38,150
with learning
challenging yourself

00:49:38,160 --> 00:49:39,589
challenging yourself
improving

3038
00:49:39,589 --> 00:49:39,599
improving

00:49:39,599 --> 00:49:41,349
improving
being kind to each other finding a

3040
00:49:41,349 --> 00:49:41,359
being kind to each other finding a
 

3041
00:49:41,359 --> 00:49:44,549
being kind to each other finding a
community of people that uh

3042
00:49:44,549 --> 00:49:44,559
community of people that uh
 

3043
00:49:44,559 --> 00:49:46,549
community of people that uh
you know you

3044
00:49:46,549 --> 00:49:46,559
you know you
 

3045
00:49:46,559 --> 00:49:49,190
you know you
connect with on a real human level all

3046
00:49:49,190 --> 00:49:49,200
connect with on a real human level all
 

3047
00:49:49,200 --> 00:49:52,150
connect with on a real human level all
that kind of stuff but it does seem when

3048
00:49:52,150 --> 00:49:52,160
that kind of stuff but it does seem when
 

3049
00:49:52,160 --> 00:49:55,270
that kind of stuff but it does seem when
you look at social media that a lot of

3050
00:49:55,270 --> 00:49:55,280
you look at social media that a lot of
 

3051
00:49:55,280 --> 00:49:57,349
you look at social media that a lot of
fights break out a lot of arguments

3052
00:49:57,349 --> 00:49:57,359
fights break out a lot of arguments
 

3053
00:49:57,359 --> 00:49:59,670
fights break out a lot of arguments
break out a lot of

3054
00:49:59,670 --> 00:49:59,680
break out a lot of
 

3055
00:49:59,680 --> 00:50:02,230
break out a lot of
viral content ends up being sort of

3056
00:50:02,230 --> 00:50:02,240
viral content ends up being sort of
 

3057
00:50:02,240 --> 00:50:04,790
viral content ends up being sort of
outraged in one direction or the other

3058
00:50:04,790 --> 00:50:04,800
outraged in one direction or the other
 

3059
00:50:04,800 --> 00:50:07,430
outraged in one direction or the other
and so it's easy from that to infer the

3060
00:50:07,430 --> 00:50:07,440
and so it's easy from that to infer the
 

3061
00:50:07,440 --> 00:50:08,710
and so it's easy from that to infer the
narrative that

3062
00:50:08,710 --> 00:50:08,720
narrative that
 

3063
00:50:08,720 --> 00:50:11,430
narrative that
social media companies are letting this

3064
00:50:11,430 --> 00:50:11,440
social media companies are letting this
 

3065
00:50:11,440 --> 00:50:13,829
social media companies are letting this
outrage become viral

3066
00:50:13,829 --> 00:50:13,839
outrage become viral
 

3067
00:50:13,839 --> 00:50:15,510
outrage become viral
and so they're increasing the division

3068
00:50:15,510 --> 00:50:15,520
and so they're increasing the division
 

3069
00:50:15,520 --> 00:50:16,630
and so they're increasing the division
in the world

3070
00:50:16,630 --> 00:50:16,640
in the world
 

3071
00:50:16,640 --> 00:50:19,589
in the world
and perhaps you can comment on that or

3072
00:50:19,589 --> 00:50:19,599
and perhaps you can comment on that or
 

3073
00:50:19,599 --> 00:50:21,910
and perhaps you can comment on that or
further how can you be

3074
00:50:21,910 --> 00:50:21,920
further how can you be
 

3075
00:50:21,920 --> 00:50:24,230
further how can you be
how can you

3076
00:50:24,230 --> 00:50:24,240
how can you
 

3077
00:50:24,240 --> 00:50:26,069
how can you
push back on this narrative how can you

3078
00:50:26,069 --> 00:50:26,079
push back on this narrative how can you
 

3079
00:50:26,079 --> 00:50:28,549
push back on this narrative how can you
be transparent about this battle because

3080
00:50:28,549 --> 00:50:28,559
be transparent about this battle because
 

3081
00:50:28,559 --> 00:50:30,069
be transparent about this battle because
i think it's not just

3082
00:50:30,069 --> 00:50:30,079
i think it's not just
 

3083
00:50:30,079 --> 00:50:32,150
i think it's not just
motivation or

3084
00:50:32,150 --> 00:50:32,160
motivation or
 

3085
00:50:32,160 --> 00:50:33,670
motivation or
financials

3086
00:50:33,670 --> 00:50:33,680
financials
 

3087
00:50:33,680 --> 00:50:36,870
financials
it's a technical problem too which is

3088
00:50:36,870 --> 00:50:36,880
it's a technical problem too which is
 

3089
00:50:36,880 --> 00:50:39,430
it's a technical problem too which is
how do you improve

3090
00:50:39,430 --> 00:50:39,440
how do you improve
 

3091
00:50:39,440 --> 00:50:42,870
how do you improve
long-term well-being of human beings

3092
00:50:42,870 --> 00:50:42,880
long-term well-being of human beings
 

3093
00:50:42,880 --> 00:50:45,430
long-term well-being of human beings
i think that going through

3094
00:50:45,430 --> 00:50:45,440
i think that going through
 

3095
00:50:45,440 --> 00:50:47,829
i think that going through
some of the design decisions

3096
00:50:47,829 --> 00:50:47,839
some of the design decisions
 

3097
00:50:47,839 --> 00:50:50,390
some of the design decisions
would be a good conversation but first i

3098
00:50:50,390 --> 00:50:50,400
would be a good conversation but first i
 

3099
00:50:50,400 --> 00:50:52,710
would be a good conversation but first i
actually think you know i think

3100
00:50:52,710 --> 00:50:52,720
actually think you know i think
 

3101
00:50:52,720 --> 00:50:54,390
actually think you know i think
you acknowledge that you know that

3102
00:50:54,390 --> 00:50:54,400
you acknowledge that you know that
 

3103
00:50:54,400 --> 00:50:56,950
you acknowledge that you know that
narrative is somewhat anecdotal and i

3104
00:50:56,950 --> 00:50:56,960
narrative is somewhat anecdotal and i
 

3105
00:50:56,960 --> 00:50:58,630
narrative is somewhat anecdotal and i
think it's worth grounding this

3106
00:50:58,630 --> 00:50:58,640
think it's worth grounding this
 

3107
00:50:58,640 --> 00:51:00,230
think it's worth grounding this
conversation in

3108
00:51:00,230 --> 00:51:00,240
conversation in
 

3109
00:51:00,240 --> 00:51:01,910
conversation in
the actual research that has been done

3110
00:51:01,910 --> 00:51:01,920
the actual research that has been done
 

3111
00:51:01,920 --> 00:51:03,750
the actual research that has been done
on this which

3112
00:51:03,750 --> 00:51:03,760
on this which
 

3113
00:51:03,760 --> 00:51:05,750
on this which
by and large

3114
00:51:05,750 --> 00:51:05,760
by and large
 

3115
00:51:05,760 --> 00:51:07,190
by and large
finds that

3116
00:51:07,190 --> 00:51:07,200
finds that
 

3117
00:51:07,200 --> 00:51:09,190
finds that
social media is not a large driver of

3118
00:51:09,190 --> 00:51:09,200
social media is not a large driver of
 

3119
00:51:09,200 --> 00:51:11,910
social media is not a large driver of
polarization right and um you know i

3120
00:51:11,910 --> 00:51:11,920
polarization right and um you know i
 

3121
00:51:11,920 --> 00:51:13,990
polarization right and um you know i
mean there's been a number of like um

3122
00:51:13,990 --> 00:51:14,000
mean there's been a number of like um
 

3123
00:51:14,000 --> 00:51:15,829
mean there's been a number of like um
economists and social scientists and

00:51:15,829 --> 00:51:15,839
economists and social scientists and
 

3125
00:51:15,839 --> 00:51:18,549
economists and social scientists and
folks who have studied this um in a lot

3126
00:51:18,549 --> 00:51:18,559
folks who have studied this um in a lot
 

3127
00:51:18,559 --> 00:51:20,069
folks who have studied this um in a lot
of polarization it varies around the

3128
00:51:20,069 --> 00:51:20,079
of polarization it varies around the
 

3129
00:51:20,079 --> 00:51:20,950
of polarization it varies around the
world

3130
00:51:20,950 --> 00:51:20,960
world
 

3131
00:51:20,960 --> 00:51:22,309
world
you know social media is basically in

3132
00:51:22,309 --> 00:51:22,319
you know social media is basically in
 

3133
00:51:22,319 --> 00:51:23,910
you know social media is basically in
every country facebook's in pretty much

3134
00:51:23,910 --> 00:51:23,920
every country facebook's in pretty much
 

3135
00:51:23,920 --> 00:51:25,829
every country facebook's in pretty much
every country except for china and maybe

3136
00:51:25,829 --> 00:51:25,839
every country except for china and maybe
 

3137
00:51:25,839 --> 00:51:27,109
every country except for china and maybe
north korea

3138
00:51:27,109 --> 00:51:27,119
north korea
 

3139
00:51:27,119 --> 00:51:28,150
north korea
and

3140
00:51:28,150 --> 00:51:28,160
and
 

3141
00:51:28,160 --> 00:51:29,910
and
um

3142
00:51:29,910 --> 00:51:29,920
um
 

3143
00:51:29,920 --> 00:51:31,030
um
and you see different trends in

3144
00:51:31,030 --> 00:51:31,040
and you see different trends in
 

3145
00:51:31,040 --> 00:51:32,390
and you see different trends in
different places

3146
00:51:32,390 --> 00:51:32,400
different places
 

3147
00:51:32,400 --> 00:51:33,270
different places
where

3148
00:51:33,270 --> 00:51:33,280
where
 

3149
00:51:33,280 --> 00:51:34,630
where
you know in a lot of countries

3150
00:51:34,630 --> 00:51:34,640
you know in a lot of countries
 

3151
00:51:34,640 --> 00:51:36,470
you know in a lot of countries
polarization is declining

3152
00:51:36,470 --> 00:51:36,480
polarization is declining
 

3153
00:51:36,480 --> 00:51:39,190
polarization is declining
um in some it's flat in the u.s it's

3154
00:51:39,190 --> 00:51:39,200
um in some it's flat in the u.s it's
 

3155
00:51:39,200 --> 00:51:41,589
um in some it's flat in the u.s it's
it's risen sharply

3156
00:51:41,589 --> 00:51:41,599
it's risen sharply
 

3157
00:51:41,599 --> 00:51:42,309
it's risen sharply
so

3158
00:51:42,309 --> 00:51:42,319
so
 

3159
00:51:42,319 --> 00:51:43,910
so
the question is what are the unique

3160
00:51:43,910 --> 00:51:43,920
the question is what are the unique
 

3161
00:51:43,920 --> 00:51:46,069
the question is what are the unique
phenomena in the different places and i

3162
00:51:46,069 --> 00:51:46,079
phenomena in the different places and i
 

3163
00:51:46,079 --> 00:51:47,349
phenomena in the different places and i
think for the people who are trying to

3164
00:51:47,349 --> 00:51:47,359
think for the people who are trying to
 

3165
00:51:47,359 --> 00:51:48,950
think for the people who are trying to
say hey social media is the thing that's

3166
00:51:48,950 --> 00:51:48,960
say hey social media is the thing that's
 

3167
00:51:48,960 --> 00:51:51,750
say hey social media is the thing that's
doing this i think that that clearly

3168
00:51:51,750 --> 00:51:51,760
doing this i think that that clearly
 

3169
00:51:51,760 --> 00:51:53,670
doing this i think that that clearly
doesn't hold up because social media is

3170
00:51:53,670 --> 00:51:53,680
doesn't hold up because social media is
 

3171
00:51:53,680 --> 00:51:55,109
doesn't hold up because social media is
a phenomenon that is pretty much

3172
00:51:55,109 --> 00:51:55,119
a phenomenon that is pretty much
 

3173
00:51:55,119 --> 00:51:56,790
a phenomenon that is pretty much
equivalent in all of these different

3174
00:51:56,790 --> 00:51:56,800
equivalent in all of these different
 

3175
00:51:56,800 --> 00:51:59,030
equivalent in all of these different
countries and you have researchers like

3176
00:51:59,030 --> 00:51:59,040
countries and you have researchers like
 

3177
00:51:59,040 --> 00:52:00,790

about some of the forces and kind of

00:52:21,440 --> 00:52:24,230
about some of the forces and kind of
partisan politics and fox news and

3202
00:52:24,230 --> 00:52:24,240
partisan politics and fox news and
 

3203
00:52:24,240 --> 00:52:25,990
partisan politics and fox news and
different things that predate the

3204
00:52:25,990 --> 00:52:26,000
different things that predate the
 

3205
00:52:26,000 --> 00:52:28,069
different things that predate the
internet in a lot of ways that that i

3206
00:52:28,069 --> 00:52:28,079
internet in a lot of ways that that i
 

3207
00:52:28,079 --> 00:52:29,910
internet in a lot of ways that that i
think are are likely larger contributors

3208
00:52:29,910 --> 00:52:29,920
think are are likely larger contributors
 

3209
00:52:29,920 --> 00:52:33,109
think are are likely larger contributors
so to the contrary on this not only is

3210
00:52:33,109 --> 00:52:33,119
so to the contrary on this not only is
 

3211
00:52:33,119 --> 00:52:33,990
so to the contrary on this not only is
is it

3212
00:52:33,990 --> 00:52:34,000
is it
 

3213
00:52:34,000 --> 00:52:36,069
is it
pretty clear that social media is not a

3214
00:52:36,069 --> 00:52:36,079
pretty clear that social media is not a
 

3215
00:52:36,079 --> 00:52:38,549
pretty clear that social media is not a
major contributor but most of the

3216
00:52:38,549 --> 00:52:38,559
major contributor but most of the
 

3217
00:52:38,559 --> 00:52:40,309
major contributor but most of the
academic studies that i've seen actually

3218
00:52:40,309 --> 00:52:40,319
academic studies that i've seen actually
 

3219
00:52:40,319 --> 00:52:42,470
academic studies that i've seen actually
show that social media use

3220
00:52:42,470 --> 00:52:42,480
show that social media use
 

3221
00:52:42,480 --> 00:52:46,549
show that social media use
is is correlated with lower polarization

3222
00:52:46,549 --> 00:52:46,559
is is correlated with lower polarization
 

3223
00:52:46,559 --> 00:52:48,230
is is correlated with lower polarization
genscow the same person who just did the

3224
00:52:48,230 --> 00:52:48,240
genscow the same person who just did the
 

3225
00:52:48,240 --> 00:52:49,670
genscow the same person who just did the
study that i that i cited about

3226
00:52:49,670 --> 00:52:49,680
study that i that i cited about
 

3227
00:52:49,680 --> 00:52:51,829
study that i that i cited about
longitudinal polarization across

3228
00:52:51,829 --> 00:52:51,839
longitudinal polarization across
 

3229
00:52:51,839 --> 00:52:55,349
longitudinal polarization across
different countries um you know also

3230
00:52:55,349 --> 00:52:55,359
different countries um you know also
 

3231
00:52:55,359 --> 00:52:58,390
different countries um you know also
did a study that basically showed that

3232
00:52:58,390 --> 00:52:58,400
did a study that basically showed that
 

3233
00:52:58,400 --> 00:53:00,630
did a study that basically showed that
if you looked after you know the 2016

3234
00:53:00,630 --> 00:53:00,640
if you looked after you know the 2016
 

3235
00:53:00,640 --> 00:53:02,870
if you looked after you know the 2016
election in the u.s the voters who are

3236
00:53:02,870 --> 00:53:02,880
election in the u.s the voters who are
 

3237
00:53:02,880 --> 00:53:05,510
election in the u.s the voters who are
the most polarized um were actually the

3238
00:53:05,510 --> 00:53:05,520
the most polarized um were actually the
 

3239
00:53:05,520 --> 00:53:07,510
the most polarized um were actually the
ones who were not on the internet

3240
00:53:07,510 --> 00:53:07,520
ones who were not on the internet
 

3241
00:53:07,520 --> 00:53:08,390
ones who were not on the internet
so

3242
00:53:08,390 --> 00:53:08,400
so
 

3243
00:53:08,400 --> 00:53:10,150
so
and there have been recent other studies

3244
00:53:10,150 --> 00:53:10,160
and there have been recent other studies
 

3245
00:53:10,160 --> 00:53:12,390
and there have been recent other studies
i think in europe um and around the

3246
00:53:12,390 --> 00:53:12,400
i think in europe um and around the
 

3247
00:53:12,400 --> 00:53:15,349
i think in europe um and around the
world basically showing that as people

3248
00:53:15,349 --> 00:53:15,359
world basically showing that as people
 

3249
00:53:15,359 --> 00:53:17,430
world basically showing that as people
stop using social media they tend to get

3250
00:53:17,430 --> 00:53:17,440
stop using social media they tend to get
 

3251
00:53:17,440 --> 00:53:20,309
stop using social media they tend to get
more polarized um then there's a deeper

3252
00:53:20,309 --> 00:53:20,319
more polarized um then there's a deeper
 

3253
00:53:20,319 --> 00:53:22,150
more polarized um then there's a deeper
analysis around okay well what

3254
00:53:22,150 --> 00:53:22,160
analysis around okay well what
 

3255
00:53:22,160 --> 00:53:23,589
analysis around okay well what
polarization actually isn't even one

3256
00:53:23,589 --> 00:53:23,599
polarization actually isn't even one
 

3257
00:53:23,599 --> 00:53:25,270
polarization actually isn't even one
thing um because you know having

3258
00:53:25,270 --> 00:53:25,280
thing um because you know having
 

3259
00:53:25,280 --> 00:53:26,950
thing um because you know having
different opinions on something isn't i

3260
00:53:26,950 --> 00:53:26,960
different opinions on something isn't i
 

3261
00:53:26,960 --> 00:53:28,790
different opinions on something isn't i
don't think that that's by itself bad

3262
00:53:28,790 --> 00:53:28,800
don't think that that's by itself bad
 

3263
00:53:28,800 --> 00:53:31,670
don't think that that's by itself bad
what what people who study this say is

3264
00:53:31,670 --> 00:53:31,680
what what people who study this say is
 

3265
00:53:31,680 --> 00:53:32,950
what what people who study this say is
um

3266
00:53:32,950 --> 00:53:32,960
um
 

3267
00:53:32,960 --> 00:53:34,309
um
most problematic is what they call

3268
00:53:34,309 --> 00:53:34,319
most problematic is what they call
 

3269
00:53:34,319 --> 00:53:36,390
most problematic is what they call
affective polarization which is

3270
00:53:36,390 --> 00:53:36,400
affective polarization which is
 

3271
00:53:36,400 --> 00:53:38,710
affective polarization which is
basically are you do you have negative

3272
00:53:38,710 --> 00:53:38,720
basically are you do you have negative
 

3273
00:53:38,720 --> 00:53:40,870
basically are you do you have negative
feelings towards people of another group

3274
00:53:40,870 --> 00:53:40,880
feelings towards people of another group
 

3275
00:53:40,880 --> 00:53:43,349
feelings towards people of another group
and the way that a lot of scholars study

3276
00:53:43,349 --> 00:53:43,359
and the way that a lot of scholars study
 

3277
00:53:43,359 --> 00:53:45,030
and the way that a lot of scholars study
this is they basically

3278
00:53:45,030 --> 00:53:45,040
this is they basically
 

3279
00:53:45,040 --> 00:53:48,309
this is they basically
ask a group um would you let your kids

3280
00:53:48,309 --> 00:53:48,319
ask a group um would you let your kids
 

3281
00:53:48,319 --> 00:53:51,510
ask a group um would you let your kids
marry someone of group x whatever the

3282
00:53:51,510 --> 00:53:51,520
marry someone of group x whatever the
 

3283
00:53:51,520 --> 00:53:52,870
marry someone of group x whatever the
the groups are that you're that you're

3284
00:53:52,870 --> 00:53:52,880
the groups are that you're that you're
 

3285
00:53:52,880 --> 00:53:54,230
the groups are that you're that you're
worried that someone might have negative

3286
00:53:54,230 --> 00:53:54,240
worried that someone might have negative
 

3287
00:53:54,240 --> 00:53:57,030
worried that someone might have negative
feelings towards and in general use of

3288
00:53:57,030 --> 00:53:57,040
feelings towards and in general use of
 

3289
00:53:57,040 --> 00:53:59,109
feelings towards and in general use of
social media has corresponded to

3290
00:53:59,109 --> 00:53:59,119
social media has corresponded to
 

3291
00:53:59,119 --> 00:54:00,790
social media has corresponded to
decreases in that kind of affective

3292
00:54:00,790 --> 00:54:00,800
decreases in that kind of affective
 

3293
00:54:00,800 --> 00:54:04,069
decreases in that kind of affective
polarization so i i just want to i think

3294
00:54:04,069 --> 00:54:04,079
polarization so i i just want to i think
 

3295
00:54:04,079 --> 00:54:05,190
polarization so i i just want to i think
we should talk through the design

3296
00:54:05,190 --> 00:54:05,200
we should talk through the design
 

3297
00:54:05,200 --> 00:54:08,470
we should talk through the design
decisions and how we handle um the the

3298
00:54:08,470 --> 00:54:08,480
decisions and how we handle um the the
 

3299
00:54:08,480 --> 00:54:11,589
decisions and how we handle um the the
kind of specific pieces of content but

3300
00:54:11,589 --> 00:54:11,599
kind of specific pieces of content but
 

3301
00:54:11,599 --> 00:54:12,790
kind of specific pieces of content but
overall i think it's just worth

3302
00:54:12,790 --> 00:54:12,800
overall i think it's just worth
 

3303
00:54:12,800 --> 00:54:14,230
overall i think it's just worth
grounding that discussion in the

3304
00:54:14,230 --> 00:54:14,240
grounding that discussion in the
 

3305
00:54:14,240 --> 00:54:16,150
grounding that discussion in the
research that's existed that i think

3306
00:54:16,150 --> 00:54:16,160
research that's existed that i think
 

3307
00:54:16,160 --> 00:54:18,470
research that's existed that i think
overwhelmingly shows that the mainstream

3308
00:54:18,470 --> 00:54:18,480
overwhelmingly shows that the mainstream
 

3309
00:54:18,480 --> 00:54:20,870
overwhelmingly shows that the mainstream
narrative around this is just not right

3310
00:54:20,870 --> 00:54:20,880
narrative around this is just not right
 

3311
00:54:20,880 --> 00:54:23,990
narrative around this is just not right
but the the narrative does stay cold

3312
00:54:23,990 --> 00:54:24,000
but the the narrative does stay cold
 

3313
00:54:24,000 --> 00:54:25,349
but the the narrative does stay cold
and

3314
00:54:25,349 --> 00:54:25,359
and
 

3315
00:54:25,359 --> 00:54:28,069
and
it's compelling to a lot of people

3316
00:54:28,069 --> 00:54:28,079
it's compelling to a lot of people
 

3317
00:54:28,079 --> 00:54:29,910
it's compelling to a lot of people
there's another question i'd like to ask

maybe you can help me understand that

3336
00:54:50,549 --> 00:54:50,559
maybe you can help me understand that
 

3337
00:54:50,559 --> 00:54:52,630
maybe you can help me understand that
why do you think so many people dislike

world it is u.s yeah so i think that

3362
00:55:18,230 --> 00:55:18,240
world it is u.s yeah so i think that
 

3363
00:55:18,240 --> 00:55:21,750
world it is u.s yeah so i think that
there's a few dynamics one is that

3364
00:55:21,750 --> 00:55:21,760
there's a few dynamics one is that
 

3365
00:55:21,760 --> 00:55:24,309
there's a few dynamics one is that

3372
00:55:29,270 --> 00:55:29,280
compared to other places it's not that
 

3373
00:55:29,280 --> 00:55:31,430

00:55:33,990 --> 00:55:34,000
issues too but i think in the us there
 

3377
00:55:34,000 --> 00:55:34,789
issues too but i think in the us there
was

3378
00:55:34,789 --> 00:55:34,799
was
 

3379
00:55:34,799 --> 00:55:36,789
was
this dynamic where

3380
00:55:36,789 --> 00:55:36,799
this dynamic where
 

3381
00:55:36,799 --> 00:55:38,789
this dynamic where
if you look at like the next sentiment

3382
00:55:38,789 --> 00:55:38,799

00:55:41,680 --> 00:55:44,230
of kind of coverage or or attitude
towards us you know before 2016 i think

3386
00:55:44,230 --> 00:55:44,240
towards us you know before 2016 i think
 

3387
00:55:44,240 --> 00:55:45,589
towards us you know before 2016 i think
that there were probably very few months

3388
00:55:45,589 --> 00:55:45,599
that there were probably very few months
 

3389
00:55:45,599 --> 00:55:47,829
that there were probably very few months
if any where it was negative and since

3390
00:55:47,829 --> 00:55:47,839
if any where it was negative and since
 

3391
00:55:47,839 --> 00:55:49,670
if any where it was negative and since
2016 i think they've probably been very

3392
00:55:49,670 --> 00:55:49,680
2016 i think they've probably been very
 

3393
00:55:49,680 --> 00:55:50,870
2016 i think they've probably been very
few months if any then it's been

3394
00:55:50,870 --> 00:55:50,880
few months if any then it's been
 

3395
00:55:50,880 --> 00:55:51,910
few months if any then it's been
positive

3396
00:55:51,910 --> 00:55:51,920
positive
 

3397
00:55:51,920 --> 00:55:54,309
positive
politics so but i think it's it's a

3398
00:55:54,309 --> 00:55:54,319
politics so but i think it's it's a
 

3399
00:55:54,319 --> 00:55:55,829
politics so but i think it's it's a
specific thing and this is very

3400
00:55:55,829 --> 00:55:55,839
specific thing and this is very
 

3401
00:55:55,839 --> 00:55:57,030
specific thing and this is very
different from other places so i think

3402
00:55:57,030 --> 00:55:57,040
different from other places so i think
 

3403
00:55:57,040 --> 00:55:58,870
different from other places so i think
in a lot of other countries in the world

3404
00:55:58,870 --> 00:55:58,880
in a lot of other countries in the world

00:56:33,760 --> 00:56:36,390
we're in a
um

3448
00:56:36,390 --> 00:56:36,400

 

3449
00:56:36,400 --> 00:56:37,910

one of the positions that we're in that

00:56:37,910 --> 00:56:37,920
one of the positions that we're in that
 

3451
00:56:37,920 --> 00:56:40,470
one of the positions that we're in that
i think is really challenging is that

3452
00:56:40,470 --> 00:56:40,480
i think is really challenging is that
 

3453
00:56:40,480 --> 00:56:42,150
i think is really challenging is that
because of a lot of the content

3454
00:56:42,150 --> 00:56:42,160
because of a lot of the content
 

3455
00:56:42,160 --> 00:56:44,230
because of a lot of the content
decisions that we're that we've

3456
00:56:44,230 --> 00:56:44,240
decisions that we're that we've
 

3457
00:56:44,240 --> 00:56:47,030
decisions that we're that we've
basically had to arbitrate um

3458
00:56:47,030 --> 00:56:47,040
basically had to arbitrate um
 

3459
00:56:47,040 --> 00:56:49,190
basically had to arbitrate um
and because we're not a partisan company

3460
00:56:49,190 --> 00:56:49,200
and because we're not a partisan company

3464
00:56:52,789 --> 00:56:52,799
company or a republican company we're
 

3465
00:56:52,799 --> 00:56:54,950
company or a republican company we're
trying to make the best decisions we can

3466
00:56:54,950 --> 00:56:54,960
trying to make the best decisions we can

trying to make the best decisions we can
to help people connect and

3468
00:56:56,870 --> 00:56:56,880
to help people connect and
 

3469
00:56:56,880 --> 00:56:58,470
to help people connect and
and help people have as much voice as

3470
00:56:58,470 --> 00:56:58,480
and help people have as much voice as
 

3471
00:56:58,480 --> 00:57:00,630
and help people have as much voice as
they can while you know having some

3472
00:57:00,630 --> 00:57:00,640
they can while you know having some
 

3473
00:57:00,640 --> 00:57:02,069
they can while you know having some
rules because it we're running a

3474
00:57:02,069 --> 00:57:02,079
rules because it we're running a
 

3475
00:57:02,079 --> 00:57:04,950
rules because it we're running a
community um

3476
00:57:04,950 --> 00:57:04,960
community um
 

3477
00:57:04,960 --> 00:57:06,390
community um
the net effect of that is that we're

3478
00:57:06,390 --> 00:57:06,400
the net effect of that is that we're
 

3479
00:57:06,400 --> 00:57:09,430
the net effect of that is that we're
kind of constantly making decisions that

3480
00:57:09,430 --> 00:57:09,440
kind of constantly making decisions that
 

3481
00:57:09,440 --> 00:57:12,630
kind of constantly making decisions that
piss off people in both camps

3482
00:57:12,630 --> 00:57:12,640
piss off people in both camps
 

3483
00:57:12,640 --> 00:57:13,670
piss off people in both camps
and

00:57:13,670 --> 00:57:13,680
and
 

3485
00:57:13,680 --> 00:57:16,470
and
the effect that i've sort of seen

3486
00:57:16,470 --> 00:57:16,480
the effect that i've sort of seen
 

3487
00:57:16,480 --> 00:57:19,109
the effect that i've sort of seen
is that when we make a decision

3488
00:57:19,109 --> 00:57:19,119
is that when we make a decision
 

3489
00:57:19,119 --> 00:57:21,430
is that when we make a decision
that is

3490
00:57:21,430 --> 00:57:21,440
that is
 

3491
00:57:21,440 --> 00:57:23,190
that is
that's a controversial one that's going

and
um

3538
00:58:07,030 --> 00:58:07,040
um
 

3539
00:58:07,040 --> 00:58:09,190
um
you know it's or if you take it down the

3540

00:58:16,319 --> 00:58:18,309
so our internal assessment of the kind
of analytics on our brand are basically

3550
00:58:18,309 --> 00:58:18,319
of analytics on our brand are basically
 

3551

3559
00:58:27,839 --> 00:58:29,510
country and then like if you and then if
you just kind of extrapolate that out

3560
00:58:29,510 --> 00:58:29,520
you just kind of extrapolate that out
 

3561
00:58:29,520 --> 00:58:31,349
you just kind of extrapolate that out
it's just been very challenging for us

3562
00:58:31,349 --> 00:58:31,359
it's just been very challenging for us
 

3563
00:58:31,359 --> 00:58:34,549
it's just been very challenging for us
to try to navigate what is a polarizing

3564
00:58:34,549 --> 00:58:34,559
to try to navigate what is a polarizing
 

3565
00:58:34,559 --> 00:58:36,710
to try to navigate what is a polarizing
country in a principled way where we're

3566

country in a principled way where we're
 

3567
00:58:36,720 --> 00:58:38,549
country in a principled way where we're
not trying to kind of hew to one side or

3568
00:58:38,549 --> 00:58:38,559
not trying to kind of hew to one side or

really do it for a long period of time
 

3643
01:00:01,520 --> 01:00:02,630
really do it for a long period of time
if you really care about what you're

dissent
 

3803
01:02:38,319 --> 01:02:40,470
dissent
internally which is you know why there's

internally which is you know why there's
 

3805
01:02:40,480 --> 01:02:42,390
internally which is you know why there's
so much material internally that can

3806
01:02:42,390 --> 01:02:42,400
so much material internally that can
 

3807
01:02:42,400 --> 01:02:44,390
so much material internally that can
leak out with people sort of disagreeing

leak out with people sort of disagreeing
 

3809
01:02:44,400 --> 01:02:46,710
leak out with people sort of disagreeing
is because that's sort of the culture

there for a while but there's a very
 

3821
01:02:55,680 --> 01:02:57,589
there for a while but there's a very
high level of trust and

high level of trust and
 

3823

4005
01:06:01,280 --> 01:06:03,510
you know we really care about this stuff
so we wanted to study it and and of

4006
01:06:03,510 --> 01:06:03,520
so we wanted to study it and and of
 

4007
01:06:03,520 --> 01:06:05,029
so we wanted to study it and and of
course you know we didn't expect that

4008

course you know we didn't expect that
 

4009
01:06:05,039 --> 01:06:06,390
course you know we didn't expect that
everything was going to be positive all

4010
01:06:06,390 --> 01:06:06,400
everything was going to be positive all
 

4011
01:06:06,400 --> 01:06:07,670
everything was going to be positive all
the time so i mean the reason why you

4012
01:06:07,670 --> 01:06:07,680
the time so i mean the reason why you
 

4013
01:06:07,680 --> 01:06:09,990
the time so i mean the reason why you
study this stuff is to try to improve

4014
01:06:09,990 --> 01:06:10,000
study this stuff is to try to improve
 

4015
01:06:10,000 --> 01:06:12,230

and get better so i mean look the place

4016
01:06:12,230 --> 01:06:12,240
and get better so i mean look the place
 

4017
01:06:12,240 --> 01:06:13,270
and get better so i mean look the place
where i disagree with the

4018
01:06:13,270 --> 01:06:13,280
where i disagree with the
 

4019
01:06:13,280 --> 01:06:15,109
where i disagree with the
characterization first

4020
01:06:15,109 --> 01:06:15,119
characterization first
 

4021
01:06:15,119 --> 01:06:17,589
characterization first
i thought you know some of the reporting

4022
01:06:17,589 --> 01:06:17,599
i thought you know some of the reporting
 

4023
01:06:17,599 --> 01:06:19,349
i thought you know some of the reporting
and coverage of it just took the whole

4024
01:06:19,349 --> 01:06:19,359
and coverage of it just took the whole
 

4025
01:06:19,359 --> 01:06:21,109
and coverage of it just took the whole
thing out of proportion and that it

4026
01:06:21,109 --> 01:06:21,119
thing out of proportion and that it
 

4027
01:06:21,119 --> 01:06:22,789
thing out of proportion and that it
focused on as you said i think there

4028
01:06:22,789 --> 01:06:22,799
focused on as you said i think there
 

4029
01:06:22,799 --> 01:06:24,710
focused on as you said i think there
were like 20 metrics in there and on you

4030
01:06:24,710 --> 01:06:24,720
were like 20 metrics in there and on you
 

4031
01:06:24,720 --> 01:06:26,950
were like 20 metrics in there and on you
know 18 or 19 the effect of using

4032
01:06:26,950 --> 01:06:26,960
know 18 or 19 the effect of using
 

4033
01:06:26,960 --> 01:06:29,670
know 18 or 19 the effect of using
instagram was neutral or positive on the

4034
01:06:29,670 --> 01:06:29,680
instagram was neutral or positive on the
 

4035
01:06:29,680 --> 01:06:31,589
instagram was neutral or positive on the
on the team's well-being and there was

4036
01:06:31,589 --> 01:06:31,599
on the team's well-being and there was
 

4037
01:06:31,599 --> 01:06:34,150
on the team's well-being and there was
one area where where i think um it

4038
01:06:34,150 --> 01:06:34,160
one area where where i think um it
 

4039
01:06:34,160 --> 01:06:35,589
one area where where i think um it
showed that we needed to improve and we

4040
01:06:35,589 --> 01:06:35,599
showed that we needed to improve and we
 

4041
01:06:35,599 --> 01:06:37,589
showed that we needed to improve and we
took some steps to try to do that um

4042
01:06:37,589 --> 01:06:37,599
took some steps to try to do that um
 

4043
01:06:37,599 --> 01:06:39,430
took some steps to try to do that um
after doing the research but but i think

4044
01:06:39,430 --> 01:06:39,440
after doing the research but but i think
 

4045
01:06:39,440 --> 01:06:41,029
after doing the research but but i think
having the coverage just focus on that

4046
01:06:41,029 --> 01:06:41,039
having the coverage just focus on that
 

4047
01:06:41,039 --> 01:06:43,109
having the coverage just focus on that
one without focusing on the you know i

4048
01:06:43,109 --> 01:06:43,119
one without focusing on the you know i
 

4049
01:06:43,119 --> 01:06:44,309
one without focusing on the you know i
mean i think an accurate

4050
01:06:44,309 --> 01:06:44,319
mean i think an accurate
 

4051
01:06:44,319 --> 01:06:46,630
mean i think an accurate
characterization would have been that

4052
01:06:46,630 --> 01:06:46,640
characterization would have been that
 

4053
01:06:46,640 --> 01:06:49,349
characterization would have been that
kids using instagram or not kids teens

4054
01:06:49,349 --> 01:06:49,359
kids using instagram or not kids teens
 

4055
01:06:49,359 --> 01:06:50,549
kids using instagram or not kids teens
um

4056
01:06:50,549 --> 01:06:50,559
um
 

4057
01:06:50,559 --> 01:06:52,390
um
is is generally positive for their

4058
01:06:52,390 --> 01:06:52,400
is is generally positive for their
 

4059
01:06:52,400 --> 01:06:54,230
is is generally positive for their
mental health um but of course that was

4060
01:06:54,230 --> 01:06:54,240
mental health um but of course that was
 

4061
01:06:54,240 --> 01:06:55,589
mental health um but of course that was
not the narrative that came out so i

4062
01:06:55,589 --> 01:06:55,599
not the narrative that came out so i
 

4063
01:06:55,599 --> 01:06:57,750
not the narrative that came out so i
think it's hard to that's not a kind of

4064
01:06:57,750 --> 01:06:57,760
think it's hard to that's not a kind of
 

4065
01:06:57,760 --> 01:06:59,670
think it's hard to that's not a kind of
logical thing to straw man but i sort of

4066
01:06:59,670 --> 01:06:59,680
logical thing to straw man but i sort of
 

4067
01:06:59,680 --> 01:07:01,750
logical thing to straw man but i sort of
disagr or still man but i sort of

4068
01:07:01,750 --> 01:07:01,760
disagr or still man but i sort of
 

4069
01:07:01,760 --> 01:07:03,270
disagr or still man but i sort of
disagree with that overall

4070
01:07:03,270 --> 01:07:03,280
disagree with that overall
 

4071
01:07:03,280 --> 01:07:04,870
disagree with that overall
characterization i think anyone sort of

4072
01:07:04,870 --> 01:07:04,880
characterization i think anyone sort of
 

4073
01:07:04,880 --> 01:07:06,069
characterization i think anyone sort of
looking at this

4074
01:07:06,069 --> 01:07:06,079
looking at this
 

4075
01:07:06,079 --> 01:07:07,430
looking at this
um

4076
01:07:07,430 --> 01:07:07,440
um
 

4077
01:07:07,440 --> 01:07:09,190
um
objectively would

4078
01:07:09,190 --> 01:07:09,200
objectively would
 

4079
01:07:09,200 --> 01:07:11,750
objectively would
um but then you know i mean the the

4080
01:07:11,750 --> 01:07:11,760
um but then you know i mean the the
 

4081
01:07:11,760 --> 01:07:14,390
um but then you know i mean the the
there is this sort of intent

4082
01:07:14,390 --> 01:07:14,400
there is this sort of intent
 

4083
01:07:14,400 --> 01:07:15,670
there is this sort of intent
critique that i think you were getting

4084
01:07:15,670 --> 01:07:15,680
critique that i think you were getting
 

4085
01:07:15,680 --> 01:07:17,750
critique that i think you were getting
at before which which says you know it

4086
01:07:17,750 --> 01:07:17,760
at before which which says you know it
 

4087
01:07:17,760 --> 01:07:19,589
at before which which says you know it
assumes some sort of malevolence right

4088
01:07:19,589 --> 01:07:19,599
assumes some sort of malevolence right
 

4089
01:07:19,599 --> 01:07:21,430
assumes some sort of malevolence right
it's like um

4090
01:07:21,430 --> 01:07:21,440
it's like um
 

4091
01:07:21,440 --> 01:07:24,710
it's like um
which it's it's really hard for me to

4092
01:07:24,710 --> 01:07:24,720
which it's it's really hard for me to
 

4093
01:07:24,720 --> 01:07:27,910
which it's it's really hard for me to
really wrap my head around this because

4094
01:07:27,910 --> 01:07:27,920
really wrap my head around this because
 

4095
01:07:27,920 --> 01:07:29,750
really wrap my head around this because
as far as i know

4096
01:07:29,750 --> 01:07:29,760
as far as i know
 

4097
01:07:29,760 --> 01:07:31,029
as far as i know
it's not clear that any of the other

4098
01:07:31,029 --> 01:07:31,039
it's not clear that any of the other
 

4099
01:07:31,039 --> 01:07:32,390
it's not clear that any of the other
tech companies are doing this kind of

4100
01:07:32,390 --> 01:07:32,400
tech companies are doing this kind of
 

4101
01:07:32,400 --> 01:07:33,990
tech companies are doing this kind of
research so

4102
01:07:33,990 --> 01:07:34,000
research so
 

4103
01:07:34,000 --> 01:07:36,630
research so
why the narrative should form that we

4104
01:07:36,630 --> 01:07:36,640
why the narrative should form that we
 

4105
01:07:36,640 --> 01:07:38,470
why the narrative should form that we
did research because we were studying an

4106
01:07:38,470 --> 01:07:38,480
did research because we were studying an
 

4107
01:07:38,480 --> 01:07:39,750
did research because we were studying an
issue because we wanted to understand it

4108
01:07:39,750 --> 01:07:39,760
issue because we wanted to understand it
 

4109
01:07:39,760 --> 01:07:42,309
issue because we wanted to understand it
to improve and took steps after that to

4110
01:07:42,309 --> 01:07:42,319
to improve and took steps after that to
 

4111
01:07:42,319 --> 01:07:44,069
to improve and took steps after that to
try to improve it that your your

4112
01:07:44,069 --> 01:07:44,079
try to improve it that your your
 

4113
01:07:44,079 --> 01:07:46,230
try to improve it that your your
interpretation of that would be

4114
01:07:46,230 --> 01:07:46,240
interpretation of that would be
 

4115
01:07:46,240 --> 01:07:48,069
interpretation of that would be
that that we did the research and tried

4116
01:07:48,069 --> 01:07:48,079
that that we did the research and tried
 

4117
01:07:48,079 --> 01:07:49,990
that that we did the research and tried
to sweep it under the rug it just it

4118
01:07:49,990 --> 01:07:50,000
to sweep it under the rug it just it
 

4119
01:07:50,000 --> 01:07:51,990
to sweep it under the rug it just it
sort of um

4120
01:07:51,990 --> 01:07:52,000
sort of um
 

4121
01:07:52,000 --> 01:07:53,510
sort of um
is like

4122
01:07:53,510 --> 01:07:53,520
is like
 

4123
01:07:53,520 --> 01:07:55,270
is like
i don't know it's beyond credibility to

4124
01:07:55,270 --> 01:07:55,280
i don't know it's beyond credibility to
 

4125
01:07:55,280 --> 01:07:57,670
i don't know it's beyond credibility to
me that like that's the accurate

4126
01:07:57,670 --> 01:07:57,680
me that like that's the accurate
 

4127
01:07:57,680 --> 01:07:59,109
me that like that's the accurate
description of the actions that we've

4128
01:07:59,109 --> 01:07:59,119
description of the actions that we've
 

4129
01:07:59,119 --> 01:08:00,549
description of the actions that we've
taken compared to the others in the

4130
01:08:00,549 --> 01:08:00,559
taken compared to the others in the
 

4131
01:08:00,559 --> 01:08:02,630
taken compared to the others in the
industry so i don't know that that's

4132
01:08:02,630 --> 01:08:02,640
industry so i don't know that that's
 

4133
01:08:02,640 --> 01:08:04,309
industry so i don't know that that's
that's kind of that's that's my view on

4134
01:08:04,309 --> 01:08:04,319
that's kind of that's that's my view on
 

4135

01:11:04,320 --> 01:11:07,110
very context specific it's not like
you're trying to fit a a formula of like

4318
01:11:07,110 --> 01:11:07,120
you're trying to fit a a formula of like
 

4319
01:11:07,120 --> 01:11:08,709
you're trying to fit a a formula of like
you know if if like looking at the

4320
01:11:08,709 --> 01:11:08,719
you know if if like looking at the
 

4321
01:11:08,719 --> 01:11:10,709
you know if if like looking at the
different harms um you know someone

4322
01:11:10,709 --> 01:11:10,719
different harms um you know someone
 

4323
01:11:10,719 --> 01:11:13,110
different harms um you know someone
promoting a terrorist group is like

4324
01:11:13,110 --> 01:11:13,120
promoting a terrorist group is like
 

4325
01:11:13,120 --> 01:11:14,390
promoting a terrorist group is like
probably one of the simpler things to

4326
01:11:14,390 --> 01:11:14,400
probably one of the simpler things to
 

4327
01:11:14,400 --> 01:11:16,229
probably one of the simpler things to
generally find because things promoting

4328
01:11:16,229 --> 01:11:16,239
generally find because things promoting
 

4329
01:11:16,239 --> 01:11:18,070
generally find because things promoting
that group are gonna you know look a

4330
01:11:18,070 --> 01:11:18,080
that group are gonna you know look a
 

4331
01:11:18,080 --> 01:11:20,229
that group are gonna you know look a
certain way or feel a certain way

4332
01:11:20,229 --> 01:11:20,239
certain way or feel a certain way
 

4333
01:11:20,239 --> 01:11:22,070
certain way or feel a certain way
bullying could just be you know someone

4334
01:11:22,070 --> 01:11:22,080
bullying could just be you know someone
 

4335
01:11:22,080 --> 01:11:23,990
bullying could just be you know someone
making some subtle comment about

4336
01:11:23,990 --> 01:11:24,000
making some subtle comment about
 

4337
01:11:24,000 --> 01:11:25,030
making some subtle comment about
someone's appearance that's

4338
01:11:25,030 --> 01:11:25,040
someone's appearance that's
 

4339
01:11:25,040 --> 01:11:27,430
someone's appearance that's
idiosyncratic to them and it could look

4340
01:11:27,430 --> 01:11:27,440
idiosyncratic to them and it could look
 

4341
01:11:27,440 --> 01:11:29,510
idiosyncratic to them and it could look
at just like humor so similar to one

4342
01:11:29,510 --> 01:11:29,520
at just like humor so similar to one
 

4343
01:11:29,520 --> 01:11:31,430
at just like humor so similar to one
person exactly destructive to another

4344
01:11:31,430 --> 01:11:31,440
person exactly destructive to another
 

4345
01:11:31,440 --> 01:11:33,030
person exactly destructive to another
human being yeah so with bullying i

4346
01:11:33,030 --> 01:11:33,040
human being yeah so with bullying i
 

4347
01:11:33,040 --> 01:11:34,070
human being yeah so with bullying i
think there are

4348
01:11:34,070 --> 01:11:34,080
think there are
 

4349
01:11:34,080 --> 01:11:36,070
think there are
there are certain

4350
01:11:36,070 --> 01:11:36,080
there are certain
 

4351
01:11:36,080 --> 01:11:38,390
there are certain
things that you can find through ai

4352
01:11:38,390 --> 01:11:38,400
things that you can find through ai
 

4353
01:11:38,400 --> 01:11:39,510
things that you can find through ai
systems

4354
01:11:39,510 --> 01:11:39,520
systems
 

4355
01:11:39,520 --> 01:11:41,750
systems
um but i think it is increasingly

4356
01:11:41,750 --> 01:11:41,760
um but i think it is increasingly
 

4357
01:11:41,760 --> 01:11:43,669
um but i think it is increasingly
important to just give people more

4358
01:11:43,669 --> 01:11:43,679
important to just give people more
 

4359
01:11:43,679 --> 01:11:45,510
important to just give people more
agency themselves so we've done things

4360
01:11:45,510 --> 01:11:45,520
agency themselves so we've done things
 

4361
01:11:45,520 --> 01:11:47,189
agency themselves so we've done things
like making it so people can turn off

4362
01:11:47,189 --> 01:11:47,199
like making it so people can turn off
 

4363
01:11:47,199 --> 01:11:49,750
like making it so people can turn off
comments or you know take a break from

4364
01:11:49,750 --> 01:11:49,760
comments or you know take a break from
 

4365
01:11:49,760 --> 01:11:51,590
comments or you know take a break from
um you know hearing from a specific

4366
01:11:51,590 --> 01:11:51,600
um you know hearing from a specific
 

4367
01:11:51,600 --> 01:11:53,990
um you know hearing from a specific
person without having to signal at all

4368
01:11:53,990 --> 01:11:54,000
person without having to signal at all
 

4369
01:11:54,000 --> 01:11:55,189
person without having to signal at all
that they're going to stop following

4370
01:11:55,189 --> 01:11:55,199
that they're going to stop following
 

4371
01:11:55,199 --> 01:11:56,310
that they're going to stop following
them or

4372
01:11:56,310 --> 01:11:56,320
them or
 

4373
01:11:56,320 --> 01:11:58,070
them or
or kind of make some some stand that

4374
01:11:58,070 --> 01:11:58,080
or kind of make some some stand that
 

4375
01:11:58,080 --> 01:11:59,350
or kind of make some some stand that

i'm not following you i just like i just

4378
01:12:00,950 --> 01:12:00,960
i'm not following you i just like i just
 

4379
01:12:00,960 --> 01:12:02,310
i'm not following you i just like i just
don't want to hear about this but i also

4380
01:12:02,310 --> 01:12:02,320
don't want to hear about this but i also
 

4381
01:12:02,320 --> 01:12:05,510
don't want to hear about this but i also
don't want to signal um at all publicly

4382
01:12:05,510 --> 01:12:05,520
don't want to signal um at all publicly
 

4383
01:12:05,520 --> 01:12:07,990
don't want to signal um at all publicly
that um or to them that that there's

4384
01:12:07,990 --> 01:12:08,000
that um or to them that that there's
 

4385
01:12:08,000 --> 01:12:09,189
that um or to them that that there's
been an issue

4386
01:12:09,189 --> 01:12:09,199
been an issue
 

4387
01:12:09,199 --> 01:12:10,790
been an issue
um

4388
01:12:10,790 --> 01:12:10,800
um
 

4389
01:12:10,800 --> 01:12:12,709
um
and then you get to

4390
01:12:12,709 --> 01:12:12,719
and then you get to
 

4391
01:12:12,719 --> 01:12:14,149
and then you get to
some of the more extreme cases like

4392
01:12:14,149 --> 01:12:14,159
some of the more extreme cases like
 

4393
01:12:14,159 --> 01:12:15,590
some of the more extreme cases like
you're talking about where someone is

4394
01:12:15,590 --> 01:12:15,600
you're talking about where someone is
 

4395
01:12:15,600 --> 01:12:16,709
you're talking about where someone is
thinking about

4396
01:12:16,709 --> 01:12:16,719
thinking about
 

4397
01:12:16,719 --> 01:12:19,830
thinking about
um self-harm or suicide and

4398
01:12:19,830 --> 01:12:19,840
um self-harm or suicide and
 

4399
01:12:19,840 --> 01:12:23,669
um self-harm or suicide and
um in there we found that that is a

4400
01:12:23,669 --> 01:12:23,679
um in there we found that that is a
 

4401
01:12:23,679 --> 01:12:26,550
um in there we found that that is a
place where ai can can identify a lot as

4402
01:12:26,550 --> 01:12:26,560
place where ai can can identify a lot as
 

4403
01:12:26,560 --> 01:12:28,310
place where ai can can identify a lot as
as well as people flagging things you

4404
01:12:28,310 --> 01:12:28,320
as well as people flagging things you
 

4405
01:12:28,320 --> 01:12:30,550
as well as people flagging things you
know if people are um expressing

4406
01:12:30,550 --> 01:12:30,560
know if people are um expressing
 

4407
01:12:30,560 --> 01:12:32,390
know if people are um expressing
something that is is you know

4408
01:12:32,390 --> 01:12:32,400
something that is is you know
 

4409
01:12:32,400 --> 01:12:33,990
something that is is you know
potentially they're thinking of hurting

4410
01:12:33,990 --> 01:12:34,000
potentially they're thinking of hurting
 

4411
01:12:34,000 --> 01:12:36,070
potentially they're thinking of hurting
themselves those are cues that you can

4412
01:12:36,070 --> 01:12:36,080
themselves those are cues that you can
 

4413
01:12:36,080 --> 01:12:38,390
themselves those are cues that you can
build systems and you know hundreds of

4414
01:12:38,390 --> 01:12:38,400
build systems and you know hundreds of
 

4415
01:12:38,400 --> 01:12:39,910
build systems and you know hundreds of
languages around the world to be able to

4416
01:12:39,910 --> 01:12:39,920
languages around the world to be able to
 

4417
01:12:39,920 --> 01:12:42,229
languages around the world to be able to
identify that and one of the things that

4418
01:12:42,229 --> 01:12:42,239
identify that and one of the things that
 

4419
01:12:42,239 --> 01:12:43,430
identify that and one of the things that
i'm

4420
01:12:43,430 --> 01:12:43,440
i'm
 

4421
01:12:43,440 --> 01:12:46,229
i'm
actually quite proud of is we've we've

4422
01:12:46,229 --> 01:12:46,239
actually quite proud of is we've we've
 

4423
01:12:46,239 --> 01:12:48,790
actually quite proud of is we've we've
built these systems that i think are

4424
01:12:48,790 --> 01:12:48,800
built these systems that i think are
 

4425
01:12:48,800 --> 01:12:51,590
built these systems that i think are
clearly leading at this point that not

4426
01:12:51,590 --> 01:12:51,600
clearly leading at this point that not
 

4427
01:12:51,600 --> 01:12:54,149
clearly leading at this point that not
only identify that but then connect with

4428
01:12:54,149 --> 01:12:54,159
only identify that but then connect with
 

4429
01:12:54,159 --> 01:12:57,669
only identify that but then connect with
local um first responders and have been

4430
01:12:57,669 --> 01:12:57,679
local um first responders and have been
 

4431
01:12:57,679 --> 01:12:59,990
local um first responders and have been
able to save i think at this point it's

4432
01:12:59,990 --> 01:13:00,000
able to save i think at this point it's
 

4433
01:13:00,000 --> 01:13:02,070
able to save i think at this point it's
you know in thousands of cases be able

4434
01:13:02,070 --> 01:13:02,080
you know in thousands of cases be able
 

4435
01:13:02,080 --> 01:13:04,550
you know in thousands of cases be able
to get first responders to people

4436
01:13:04,550 --> 01:13:04,560
to get first responders to people
 

4437
01:13:04,560 --> 01:13:06,470
to get first responders to people
through these systems who really need

4438
01:13:06,470 --> 01:13:06,480
through these systems who really need
 

4439
01:13:06,480 --> 01:13:09,030
through these systems who really need
them um because of specific plumbing

4440
01:13:09,030 --> 01:13:09,040
them um because of specific plumbing
 

4441
01:13:09,040 --> 01:13:10,630
them um because of specific plumbing
that we've done between the ai work and

4442
01:13:10,630 --> 01:13:10,640
that we've done between the ai work and
 

4443
01:13:10,640 --> 01:13:11,990
that we've done between the ai work and
being able to communicate with with

4444
01:13:11,990 --> 01:13:12,000
being able to communicate with with
 

4445
01:13:12,000 --> 01:13:13,669
being able to communicate with with
local first responder organizations

4446
01:13:13,669 --> 01:13:13,679
local first responder organizations
 

4447
01:13:13,679 --> 01:13:15,030
local first responder organizations
we're rolling that out in more places

4448
01:13:15,030 --> 01:13:15,040
we're rolling that out in more places
 

4449
01:13:15,040 --> 01:13:17,030
we're rolling that out in more places
around the world and um and i think the

4450
01:13:17,030 --> 01:13:17,040
around the world and um and i think the
 

4451
01:13:17,040 --> 01:13:18,390
around the world and um and i think the
team that that worked on that just did

4452
01:13:18,390 --> 01:13:18,400
team that that worked on that just did
 

4453
01:13:18,400 --> 01:13:20,390
team that that worked on that just did
awesome stuff so

4454
01:13:20,390 --> 01:13:20,400
awesome stuff so
 

4455
01:13:20,400 --> 01:13:21,910
awesome stuff so
i i think that that's a long way of

4456
01:13:21,910 --> 01:13:21,920
i i think that that's a long way of
 

4457
01:13:21,920 --> 01:13:22,709
i i think that that's a long way of
saying

4458
01:13:22,709 --> 01:13:22,719
saying
 

4459
01:13:22,719 --> 01:13:24,709
saying
yeah i mean this is this is a this is a

4460
01:13:24,709 --> 01:13:24,719
yeah i mean this is this is a this is a
 

4461
01:13:24,719 --> 01:13:26,470
yeah i mean this is this is a this is a
heavy topic and there's you want to

4462
01:13:26,470 --> 01:13:26,480
heavy topic and there's you want to
 

4463
01:13:26,480 --> 01:13:28,630
heavy topic and there's you want to
attack it in a bunch of different ways

4464
01:13:28,630 --> 01:13:28,640
attack it in a bunch of different ways
 

4465
01:13:28,640 --> 01:13:29,990
attack it in a bunch of different ways
um

4466
01:13:29,990 --> 01:13:30,000
um
 

4467
01:13:30,000 --> 01:13:32,470
um
and and also kind of understand that

4468
01:13:32,470 --> 01:13:32,480
and and also kind of understand that
 

4469
01:13:32,480 --> 01:13:35,110
and and also kind of understand that
some of nature is for people to

4470
01:13:35,110 --> 01:13:35,120
some of nature is for people to
 

4471
01:13:35,120 --> 01:13:36,550
some of nature is for people to
to to do this to each other which is

4472
01:13:36,550 --> 01:13:36,560
to to do this to each other which is
 

4473
01:13:36,560 --> 01:13:38,149
to to do this to each other which is
unfortunate but um but you can give

4474
01:13:38,149 --> 01:13:38,159
unfortunate but um but you can give
 

4475
01:13:38,159 --> 01:13:39,750

a couple of areas where i think this has
gotten more controversial recently which

4690
01:17:14,390 --> 01:17:14,400
gotten more controversial recently which
 

4691

right that misinformation is is
 

4695
01:17:17,840 --> 01:17:20,229
right that misinformation is is
basically is is is up there and i think

4696
01:17:20,229 --> 01:17:20,239
basically is is is up there and i think

is up there too
um but i think in general

um but i think in general
 

4703
01:17:25,280 --> 01:17:27,350
um but i think in general
most of the content that that that i

4704
01:17:27,350 --> 01:17:27,360
most of the content that that that i
 

4705

4711
01:17:33,600 --> 01:17:35,750
kind of have these questions so it's
sort of this this subset

4712

sort of this this subset
 

4713
01:17:35,760 --> 01:17:36,950
sort of this this subset
but if you go back to the beginning of

4714
01:17:36,950 --> 01:17:36,960
but if you go back to the beginning of

that you know some of this technology
 

4893
01:20:21,520 --> 01:20:23,590
that you know some of this technology
had started becoming possible and at

4894
01:20:23,590 --> 01:20:23,600
had started becoming possible and at
 

4895
01:20:23,600 --> 01:20:26,470
had started becoming possible and at
that point i really did feel like um we

4896
01:20:26,470 --> 01:20:26,480
that point i really did feel like um we
 

4897
01:20:26,480 --> 01:20:28,310
that point i really did feel like um we
needed to make a substantially larger

4898
01:20:28,310 --> 01:20:28,320
needed to make a substantially larger
 

4899
01:20:28,320 --> 01:20:29,990
needed to make a substantially larger
investment we'd already worked on this

4900
01:20:29,990 --> 01:20:30,000
investment we'd already worked on this
 

4901
01:20:30,000 --> 01:20:32,550
investment we'd already worked on this
stuff a lot on ai and on these integrity

4902
01:20:32,550 --> 01:20:32,560
stuff a lot on ai and on these integrity
 

4903
01:20:32,560 --> 01:20:35,110
stuff a lot on ai and on these integrity
problems but that we should basically

4904
01:20:35,110 --> 01:20:35,120
problems but that we should basically
 

4905
01:20:35,120 --> 01:20:36,070
problems but that we should basically
invest

4906
01:20:36,070 --> 01:20:36,080

engineers basically work on building

4910
01:20:39,030 --> 01:20:39,040
engineers basically work on building
 

4911
01:20:39,040 --> 01:20:41,030
engineers basically work on building
these ai systems to be able to go and

4912
01:20:41,030 --> 01:20:41,040
these ai systems to be able to go and
 

4913
01:20:41,040 --> 01:20:42,709
these ai systems to be able to go and
proactively identify the stuff across

4914
01:20:42,709 --> 01:20:42,719
proactively identify the stuff across
 

4915
01:20:42,719 --> 01:20:44,470
proactively identify the stuff across
all these different areas

4916
01:20:44,470 --> 01:20:44,480
all these different areas
 

4917
01:20:44,480 --> 01:20:46,790
all these different areas
okay so we went and did that now we've

4918
01:20:46,790 --> 01:20:46,800
okay so we went and did that now we've
 

4919
01:20:46,800 --> 01:20:48,870
okay so we went and did that now we've
built the tools to be able to do that

4920
01:20:48,870 --> 01:20:48,880
built the tools to be able to do that
 

4921
01:20:48,880 --> 01:20:50,709
built the tools to be able to do that
and now i think it's actually a much

4922
01:20:50,709 --> 01:20:50,719
and now i think it's actually a much
 

4923
01:20:50,719 --> 01:20:52,629
and now i think it's actually a much
more complicated set of philosophical

4924
01:20:52,629 --> 01:20:52,639
more complicated set of philosophical
 

4925
01:20:52,639 --> 01:20:55,430
more complicated set of philosophical
rather than technical questions which is

4926
01:20:55,430 --> 01:20:55,440
rather than technical questions which is
 

4927
01:20:55,440 --> 01:20:58,870
rather than technical questions which is
the exact policies which are okay now

4928
01:20:58,870 --> 01:20:58,880
the exact policies which are okay now
 

4929
01:20:58,880 --> 01:21:00,950
the exact policies which are okay now
we the way that we basically

4930
01:21:00,950 --> 01:21:00,960
we the way that we basically
 

4931
01:21:00,960 --> 01:21:02,870
we the way that we basically
hold ourselves accountable

4932
01:21:02,870 --> 01:21:02,880
hold ourselves accountable
 

4933
01:21:02,880 --> 01:21:04,470
hold ourselves accountable
is we issue these transparency reports

4934
01:21:04,470 --> 01:21:04,480
is we issue these transparency reports
 

4935
01:21:04,480 --> 01:21:06,229
is we issue these transparency reports
every quarter and the metric that we

4936
01:21:06,229 --> 01:21:06,239
every quarter and the metric that we
 

4937
01:21:06,239 --> 01:21:08,629
every quarter and the metric that we
track is for each of those 20

4938
01:21:08,629 --> 01:21:08,639
track is for each of those 20
 

4939
01:21:08,639 --> 01:21:11,510
track is for each of those 20
types of of um of harmful content how

4940
01:21:11,510 --> 01:21:11,520
types of of um of harmful content how
 

4941
01:21:11,520 --> 01:21:13,350
types of of um of harmful content how
much of that content are we taking down

4942
01:21:13,350 --> 01:21:13,360
much of that content are we taking down
 

4943
01:21:13,360 --> 01:21:14,870
much of that content are we taking down
before someone even has to report it to

4944
01:21:14,870 --> 01:21:14,880
before someone even has to report it to
 

4945
01:21:14,880 --> 01:21:16,950
before someone even has to report it to
us right so how effective is our ai at

4946
01:21:16,950 --> 01:21:16,960
us right so how effective is our ai at
 

4947
01:21:16,960 --> 01:21:18,070
us right so how effective is our ai at
doing this

4948
01:21:18,070 --> 01:21:18,080
doing this
 

4949
01:21:18,080 --> 01:21:18,790
doing this
but

4950
01:21:18,790 --> 01:21:18,800
but
 

4951
01:21:18,800 --> 01:21:20,390
but
that basically creates this big question

4952
01:21:20,390 --> 01:21:20,400
that basically creates this big question
 

4953
01:21:20,400 --> 01:21:23,030
that basically creates this big question
which is okay now we need to really

4954
01:21:23,030 --> 01:21:23,040
which is okay now we need to really
 

4955
01:21:23,040 --> 01:21:25,990
which is okay now we need to really
be careful about how proactive we set

4956
01:21:25,990 --> 01:21:26,000
be careful about how proactive we set
 

4957
01:21:26,000 --> 01:21:28,390
be careful about how proactive we set
the ai and where the exact policy lines

4958
01:21:28,390 --> 01:21:28,400
the ai and where the exact policy lines
 

4959
01:21:28,400 --> 01:21:31,270
the ai and where the exact policy lines
are around what we're taking down

4960
01:21:31,270 --> 01:21:31,280
are around what we're taking down
 

4961
01:21:31,280 --> 01:21:32,229
are around what we're taking down
it's

4962
01:21:32,229 --> 01:21:32,239
it's
 

4963
01:21:32,239 --> 01:21:33,990
it's
certainly at a point now

4964
01:21:33,990 --> 01:21:34,000
certainly at a point now
 

4965
01:21:34,000 --> 01:21:34,870
certainly at a point now
where

4966
01:21:34,870 --> 01:21:34,880
where
 

4967
01:21:34,880 --> 01:21:36,390
where
you know i felt like

4968
01:21:36,390 --> 01:21:36,400
you know i felt like
 

4969
01:21:36,400 --> 01:21:37,669
you know i felt like
at the beginning of that journey of

4970
01:21:37,669 --> 01:21:37,679
at the beginning of that journey of
 

4971
01:21:37,679 --> 01:21:41,590
at the beginning of that journey of
building those ai systems

4972
01:21:41,590 --> 01:21:41,600

 

4973
01:21:41,600 --> 01:21:43,270

there's a lot of push they're saying

4974
01:21:43,270 --> 01:21:43,280
there's a lot of push they're saying
 

4975
01:21:43,280 --> 01:21:44,470
there's a lot of push they're saying
okay you've got to do more there's

4976
01:21:44,470 --> 01:21:44,480
okay you've got to do more there's
 

4977
01:21:44,480 --> 01:21:46,709
okay you've got to do more there's
clearly a lot more bad content that that

4978
01:21:46,709 --> 01:21:46,719
clearly a lot more bad content that that
 

4979
01:21:46,719 --> 01:21:48,870
clearly a lot more bad content that that
people aren't reporting um or that

4980
01:21:48,870 --> 01:21:48,880
people aren't reporting um or that
 

4981
01:21:48,880 --> 01:21:50,149
people aren't reporting um or that
you're not getting to and you need to

4982
01:21:50,149 --> 01:21:50,159
you're not getting to and you need to
 

4983
01:21:50,159 --> 01:21:51,510
you're not getting to and you need to
get more effective at that and i was

4984
01:21:51,510 --> 01:21:51,520
get more effective at that and i was
 

4985
01:21:51,520 --> 01:21:53,110
get more effective at that and i was
pretty sympathetic to that but then i

4986
01:21:53,110 --> 01:21:53,120
pretty sympathetic to that but then i
 

4987
01:21:53,120 --> 01:21:55,030
pretty sympathetic to that but then i
think at some point along the way there

4988
01:21:55,030 --> 01:21:55,040
think at some point along the way there
 

4989
01:21:55,040 --> 01:21:57,750
think at some point along the way there
started to be almost equal issues on

4990
01:21:57,750 --> 01:21:57,760
started to be almost equal issues on
 

4991
01:21:57,760 --> 01:22:00,070
started to be almost equal issues on
both sides of okay actually you're kind

4992
01:22:00,070 --> 01:22:00,080
both sides of okay actually you're kind
 

4993
01:22:00,080 --> 01:22:02,310
both sides of okay actually you're kind
of taking down too much stuff right or

4994
01:22:02,310 --> 01:22:02,320
of taking down too much stuff right or
 

4995
01:22:02,320 --> 01:22:05,430
of taking down too much stuff right or
or some of the stuff is is borderline um

4996
01:22:05,430 --> 01:22:05,440
or some of the stuff is is borderline um
 

4997
01:22:05,440 --> 01:22:07,110
or some of the stuff is is borderline um
and and it wasn't really bothering

4998
01:22:07,110 --> 01:22:07,120
and and it wasn't really bothering
 

4999
01:22:07,120 --> 01:22:09,510
and and it wasn't really bothering
anyone and they didn't report it um

5000
01:22:09,510 --> 01:22:09,520
anyone and they didn't report it um
 

5001
01:22:09,520 --> 01:22:10,950
anyone and they didn't report it um
so is that is that really an issue that

5002
01:22:10,950 --> 01:22:10,960
so is that is that really an issue that
 

5003
01:22:10,960 --> 01:22:13,590
so is that is that really an issue that
you need to take down um whereas we

5004
01:22:13,590 --> 01:22:13,600
you need to take down um whereas we
 

5005
01:22:13,600 --> 01:22:14,790
you need to take down um whereas we
still we still have the critique on the

5006
01:22:14,790 --> 01:22:14,800
still we still have the critique on the
 

5007
01:22:14,800 --> 01:22:15,990
still we still have the critique on the
other side too where a lot of people

5008
01:22:15,990 --> 01:22:16,000
other side too where a lot of people
 

5009
01:22:16,000 --> 01:22:17,510
other side too where a lot of people
think we're not doing enough

5010
01:22:17,510 --> 01:22:17,520
think we're not doing enough
 

5011
01:22:17,520 --> 01:22:18,390
think we're not doing enough
um

5012
01:22:18,390 --> 01:22:18,400
um
 

5013
01:22:18,400 --> 01:22:19,990
um
so it's it's become

5014
01:22:19,990 --> 01:22:20,000
so it's it's become
 

5015
01:22:20,000 --> 01:22:21,750
so it's it's become
as we built the technical capacity i

5016
01:22:21,750 --> 01:22:21,760
as we built the technical capacity i
 

5017
01:22:21,760 --> 01:22:23,189
as we built the technical capacity i
think it becomes

5018
01:22:23,189 --> 01:22:23,199
think it becomes
 

5019
01:22:23,199 --> 01:22:25,750
think it becomes
more philosophically interesting almost

5020
01:22:25,750 --> 01:22:25,760
more philosophically interesting almost
 

5021
01:22:25,760 --> 01:22:28,629
more philosophically interesting almost
where you want to be on the line

5022
01:22:28,629 --> 01:22:28,639
where you want to be on the line
 

5023
01:22:28,639 --> 01:22:29,990
where you want to be on the line
and

5024
01:22:29,990 --> 01:22:30,000
and
 

5025
01:22:30,000 --> 01:22:31,590
and
i just think like you don't want one

5026
01:22:31,590 --> 01:22:31,600
i just think like you don't want one
 

5027
01:22:31,600 --> 01:22:33,590
i just think like you don't want one
person making those decisions so we've

5028
01:22:33,590 --> 01:22:33,600
person making those decisions so we've
 

5029
01:22:33,600 --> 01:22:35,030
person making those decisions so we've
also tried to innovate in terms of

5030
01:22:35,030 --> 01:22:35,040
also tried to innovate in terms of
 

5031
01:22:35,040 --> 01:22:37,030
also tried to innovate in terms of
building out this independent oversight

5032
01:22:37,030 --> 01:22:37,040
building out this independent oversight
 

5033
01:22:37,040 --> 01:22:38,950
building out this independent oversight
board which has people who are dedicated

5034
01:22:38,950 --> 01:22:38,960
board which has people who are dedicated
 

5035
01:22:38,960 --> 01:22:41,189
board which has people who are dedicated
to free expression but from around the

5036
01:22:41,189 --> 01:22:41,199
to free expression but from around the
 

5037
01:22:41,199 --> 01:22:42,310
to free expression but from around the
world

5038
01:22:42,310 --> 01:22:42,320
world
 

5039
01:22:42,320 --> 01:22:44,709
world
who people can appeal cases to um so a

5040
01:22:44,709 --> 01:22:44,719
who people can appeal cases to um so a
 

5041
01:22:44,719 --> 01:22:46,229
who people can appeal cases to um so a
lot of the most controversial cases

5042
01:22:46,229 --> 01:22:46,239
lot of the most controversial cases
 

5043
01:22:46,239 --> 01:22:47,430
lot of the most controversial cases
basically go to them and they make the

5044
01:22:47,430 --> 01:22:47,440
basically go to them and they make the
 

5045
01:22:47,440 --> 01:22:48,950
basically go to them and they make the
final binding decision on how we should

5046
01:22:48,950 --> 01:22:48,960
final binding decision on how we should
 

5047
01:22:48,960 --> 01:22:50,709
final binding decision on how we should
handle that and then of course their

5048
01:22:50,709 --> 01:22:50,719
handle that and then of course their
 

5049
01:22:50,719 --> 01:22:52,950
handle that and then of course their
decisions we then try to you know figure

5050
01:22:52,950 --> 01:22:52,960
decisions we then try to you know figure
 

5051
01:22:52,960 --> 01:22:54,310
decisions we then try to you know figure
out what the principles are behind those

5052
01:22:54,310 --> 01:22:54,320
out what the principles are behind those
 

5053
01:22:54,320 --> 01:22:56,470
out what the principles are behind those
and encode them into the the algorithms

5054
01:22:56,470 --> 01:22:56,480
and encode them into the the algorithms
 

5055
01:22:56,480 --> 01:22:58,470
and encode them into the the algorithms
and how are those people chosen which

5056
01:22:58,470 --> 01:22:58,480
and how are those people chosen which
 

5057
01:22:58,480 --> 01:23:00,229
and how are those people chosen which
you know you're outsourcing a difficult

5058
01:23:00,229 --> 01:23:00,239
you know you're outsourcing a difficult
 

5059
01:23:00,239 --> 01:23:02,790
you know you're outsourcing a difficult
decision yeah the the initial people

5060
01:23:02,790 --> 01:23:02,800
decision yeah the the initial people
 

5061
01:23:02,800 --> 01:23:04,550
decision yeah the the initial people
um we chose

5062
01:23:04,550 --> 01:23:04,560
um we chose
 

5063
01:23:04,560 --> 01:23:06,709
um we chose
a handful of chairs

5064
01:23:06,709 --> 01:23:06,719
a handful of chairs
 

5065
01:23:06,719 --> 01:23:08,470
a handful of chairs
for the um

5066
01:23:08,470 --> 01:23:08,480
for the um
 

5067
01:23:08,480 --> 01:23:09,669
for the um
for the group

5068
01:23:09,669 --> 01:23:09,679
for the group
 

5069
01:23:09,679 --> 01:23:10,470
for the group
and

5070
01:23:10,470 --> 01:23:10,480
and
 

5071
01:23:10,480 --> 01:23:12,229
and
we basically

5072
01:23:12,229 --> 01:23:12,239
we basically
 

5073
01:23:12,239 --> 01:23:14,310
we basically
chose the people for

5074
01:23:14,310 --> 01:23:14,320
chose the people for
 

5075
01:23:14,320 --> 01:23:17,189
chose the people for
a commitment to free expression

5076
01:23:17,189 --> 01:23:17,199
a commitment to free expression
 

5077
01:23:17,199 --> 01:23:18,390
a commitment to free expression
and like

5078
01:23:18,390 --> 01:23:18,400
and like
 

5079
01:23:18,400 --> 01:23:20,229
and like
a broad understanding of human rights

5080
01:23:20,229 --> 01:23:20,239
a broad understanding of human rights
 

5081
01:23:20,239 --> 01:23:21,510
a broad understanding of human rights
and the trade-offs around free

5082
01:23:21,510 --> 01:23:21,520
and the trade-offs around free
 

5083
01:23:21,520 --> 01:23:23,430
and the trade-offs around free
expression so fundamentally people who

5084
01:23:23,430 --> 01:23:23,440
expression so fundamentally people who
 

5085
01:23:23,440 --> 01:23:24,870
expression so fundamentally people who
are going to lean towards free

5086
01:23:24,870 --> 01:23:24,880
are going to lean towards free
 

5087
01:23:24,880 --> 01:23:26,629
are going to lean towards free
expression towards freedom of speech

5088
01:23:26,629 --> 01:23:26,639
expression towards freedom of speech
 

5089
01:23:26,639 --> 01:23:28,790
expression towards freedom of speech
okay so there's also this idea of fact

5090
01:23:28,790 --> 01:23:28,800
okay so there's also this idea of fact
 

5091
01:23:28,800 --> 01:23:31,030
okay so there's also this idea of fact

you asked about georgetown is my stance

5106
01:23:43,430 --> 01:23:43,440
you asked about georgetown is my stance
 

5107
01:23:43,440 --> 01:23:45,189
you asked about georgetown is my stance
fundamentally changed and the answer to

5108
01:23:45,189 --> 01:23:45,199
fundamentally changed and the answer to
 

5109
01:23:45,199 --> 01:23:46,709
fundamentally changed and the answer to
that is

5110
01:23:46,709 --> 01:23:46,719
that is
 

5111
01:23:46,719 --> 01:23:49,350
that is
no my my stance has not changed it is

the person is about to hurt themselves
 

5157

is it actually harm like as they're
being bullied and kind of at what point

5162
01:24:40,790 --> 01:24:40,800
being bullied and kind of at what point
 

5163
01:24:40,800 --> 01:24:42,470
being bullied and kind of at what point
in the spectrum is that and that's the

5164
01:24:42,470 --> 01:24:42,480
in the spectrum is that and that's the
 

5165
01:24:42,480 --> 01:24:44,870
in the spectrum is that and that's the
part that there's not agreement on but i

5166
01:24:44,870 --> 01:24:44,880
part that there's not agreement on but i
 

5167
01:24:44,880 --> 01:24:46,149
part that there's not agreement on but i
think what people agree on pretty

5168
01:24:46,149 --> 01:24:46,159
think what people agree on pretty
 

5169
01:24:46,159 --> 01:24:48,629
think what people agree on pretty
broadly is that when there is an acute

5170
01:24:48,629 --> 01:24:48,639
broadly is that when there is an acute
 

5171
01:24:48,639 --> 01:24:50,149
broadly is that when there is an acute
threat that

5172
01:24:50,149 --> 01:24:50,159
threat that
 

5173
01:24:50,159 --> 01:24:51,910
threat that
it does make sense from a societal

5174
01:24:51,910 --> 01:24:51,920
it does make sense from a societal
 

5175
01:24:51,920 --> 01:24:55,669
it does make sense from a societal
perspective to tolerate less um less

5176
01:24:55,669 --> 01:24:55,679
perspective to tolerate less um less
 

5177

that could be potentially harmful in

5180
01:24:58,310 --> 01:24:58,320
that could be potentially harmful in
 

5181
01:24:58,320 --> 01:25:00,229
that could be potentially harmful in
that acute situation so i think where

5182
01:25:00,229 --> 01:25:00,239
that acute situation so i think where
 

5183
01:25:00,239 --> 01:25:02,310
that acute situation so i think where
kovid got very difficult

5184

kovid got very difficult
 

5185
01:25:02,320 --> 01:25:03,270
kovid got very difficult

01:25:05,350 --> 01:25:05,360
expected this to be going on for years
 

5189
01:25:05,360 --> 01:25:06,790
expected this to be going on for years
um but

5190
01:25:06,790 --> 01:25:06,800
um but
 

5191
01:25:06,800 --> 01:25:09,350
um but
if in in if you'd kind of asked now a

5192
01:25:09,350 --> 01:25:09,360
if in in if you'd kind of asked now a

5195
01:25:13,040 --> 01:25:14,709

um you know a lot of people are dying

5196
01:25:14,709 --> 01:25:14,719
um you know a lot of people are dying
 

5197

um you know a lot of people are dying
and catching this

5198
01:25:16,629 --> 01:25:16,639
and catching this
 

5199
01:25:16,639 --> 01:25:19,750
and catching this
um is that an emergency that where where

5200
01:25:19,750 --> 01:25:19,760
um is that an emergency that where where
 

5201
01:25:19,760 --> 01:25:22,470
um is that an emergency that where where
you'd kind of consider it that um you

5202
01:25:22,470 --> 01:25:22,480
you'd kind of consider it that um you
 

5203
01:25:22,480 --> 01:25:24,870
you'd kind of consider it that um you
know it's problematic to to to basically

5204
01:25:24,870 --> 01:25:24,880
know it's problematic to to to basically
 

5205
01:25:24,880 --> 01:25:27,030
know it's problematic to to to basically
yell fire in a crowded theater i think

5206
01:25:27,030 --> 01:25:27,040
yell fire in a crowded theater i think
 

5207
01:25:27,040 --> 01:25:29,510
yell fire in a crowded theater i think
that that probably passes that test so i

5208
01:25:29,510 --> 01:25:29,520
that that probably passes that test so i
 

5209
01:25:29,520 --> 01:25:30,550
that that probably passes that test so i
know that's

5210
01:25:30,550 --> 01:25:30,560
know that's
 

5211
01:25:30,560 --> 01:25:32,550
know that's
it's a very tricky situation but i i

5212
01:25:32,550 --> 01:25:32,560
it's a very tricky situation but i i
 

5213
01:25:32,560 --> 01:25:35,270
it's a very tricky situation but i i
think the the fundamental commitment to

5214
01:25:35,270 --> 01:25:35,280
think the the fundamental commitment to
 

5215
01:25:35,280 --> 01:25:37,030
think the the fundamental commitment to
free expression

5216
01:25:37,030 --> 01:25:37,040
free expression
 

5217
01:25:37,040 --> 01:25:39,189
free expression
is there um and that's that's that's

5218
01:25:39,189 --> 01:25:39,199
is there um and that's that's that's
 

5219
01:25:39,199 --> 01:25:40,470
is there um and that's that's that's
what i believe and again i don't think

01:25:40,470 --> 01:25:40,480
what i believe and again i don't think

about people being able to express

5224
01:25:43,030 --> 01:25:43,040
about people being able to express
 

5225
01:25:43,040 --> 01:25:45,750
about people being able to express
themselves as much as possible but

5226
01:25:45,750 --> 01:25:45,760
themselves as much as possible but
 

5227
01:25:45,760 --> 01:25:47,590
themselves as much as possible but
but i think that that's um

5228
01:25:47,590 --> 01:25:47,600
but i think that that's um
 

5229
01:25:47,600 --> 01:25:49,110
but i think that that's um
that's the question right it's like how

5230
01:25:49,110 --> 01:25:49,120
that's the question right it's like how
 

5231
01:25:49,120 --> 01:25:50,870
that's the question right it's like how
do you define what the harm is and how

5232
01:25:50,870 --> 01:25:50,880
do you define what the harm is and how
 

5233
01:25:50,880 --> 01:25:53,510
do you define what the harm is and how
and how acute that is and what are the

5234
01:25:53,510 --> 01:25:53,520
and how acute that is and what are the
 

5235
01:25:53,520 --> 01:25:55,590
and how acute that is and what are the
institutions that define that harm a lot

5236
01:25:55,590 --> 01:25:55,600
institutions that define that harm a lot
 

5237
01:25:55,600 --> 01:25:57,189
institutions that define that harm a lot
of the criticism

5238
01:25:57,189 --> 01:25:57,199
of the criticism
 

5239
01:25:57,199 --> 01:26:00,390
of the criticism
is that the cdc the who the institutions

5240
01:26:00,390 --> 01:26:00,400
is that the cdc the who the institutions
 

5241
01:26:00,400 --> 01:26:03,910
is that the cdc the who the institutions
we've come to trust as a civilization to

5242
01:26:03,910 --> 01:26:03,920
we've come to trust as a civilization to
 

5243
01:26:03,920 --> 01:26:05,750
we've come to trust as a civilization to
uh to give

5244
01:26:05,750 --> 01:26:05,760
uh to give
 

5245
01:26:05,760 --> 01:26:07,669
uh to give
the line of what is and isn't harm in

5246
01:26:07,669 --> 01:26:07,679
the line of what is and isn't harm in
 

5247

many ways in small ways and in big ways

5250
01:26:12,790 --> 01:26:12,800
many ways in small ways and in big ways
 

5251
01:26:12,800 --> 01:26:14,790
many ways in small ways and in big ways
depending on who you ask and then the

5252
01:26:14,790 --> 01:26:14,800
depending on who you ask and then the
 

5253
01:26:14,800 --> 01:26:17,030
depending on who you ask and then the
perspective of meta and facebook is like

5254
01:26:17,030 --> 01:26:17,040
perspective of meta and facebook is like
 

5255
01:26:17,040 --> 01:26:17,990

well

5256
01:26:17,990 --> 01:26:18,000
well
 

5257
01:26:18,000 --> 01:26:19,990
well
where the hell do i get the information

5258
01:26:19,990 --> 01:26:20,000
where the hell do i get the information
 

5259
01:26:20,000 --> 01:26:22,870
where the hell do i get the information
of what isn't isn't misinformation so

5260
01:26:22,870 --> 01:26:22,880
of what isn't isn't misinformation so
 

5261
01:26:22,880 --> 01:26:24,950
of what isn't isn't misinformation so
it's a really difficult place to be in

5262
01:26:24,950 --> 01:26:24,960
it's a really difficult place to be in
 

5263
01:26:24,960 --> 01:26:26,229
it's a really difficult place to be in
but it's great to hear that you're

5264
01:26:26,229 --> 01:26:26,239
but it's great to hear that you're
 

5265
01:26:26,239 --> 01:26:28,790
but it's great to hear that you're
leaning towards freedom of speech

5266
01:26:28,790 --> 01:26:28,800
leaning towards freedom of speech
 

5267
01:26:28,800 --> 01:26:30,870
leaning towards freedom of speech
on this aspect and

5268
01:26:30,870 --> 01:26:30,880
on this aspect and
 

5269
01:26:30,880 --> 01:26:32,629
on this aspect and
again i think this actually calls to the

5270
01:26:32,629 --> 01:26:32,639
again i think this actually calls to the
 

5271
01:26:32,639 --> 01:26:35,189
again i think this actually calls to the
fact that we need to reform institutions

5272
01:26:35,189 --> 01:26:35,199
fact that we need to reform institutions
 

5273
01:26:35,199 --> 01:26:36,950
fact that we need to reform institutions
that help keep an open mind of what

5274
01:26:36,950 --> 01:26:36,960
that help keep an open mind of what
 

5275
01:26:36,960 --> 01:26:39,669
that help keep an open mind of what
isn't isn't misinformation

5276
01:26:39,669 --> 01:26:39,679
isn't isn't misinformation
 

5277
01:26:39,679 --> 01:26:41,350
isn't isn't misinformation
and misinformation has been used to

5278
01:26:41,350 --> 01:26:41,360
and misinformation has been used to
 

5279
01:26:41,360 --> 01:26:43,270
and misinformation has been used to

5603
01:32:04,639 --> 01:32:06,790
that have uh in total 6000 gpus and uh
it will eventually maybe this year maybe

5604
01:32:06,790 --> 01:32:06,800
it will eventually maybe this year maybe
 

5605
01:32:06,800 --> 01:32:10,390
it will eventually maybe this year maybe
soon we'll have 16 000 gpus so it can do

5606
01:32:10,390 --> 01:32:10,400
soon we'll have 16 000 gpus so it can do
 

5607
01:32:10,400 --> 01:32:13,590
soon we'll have 16 000 gpus so it can do
a bunch of different kinds of

5608
01:32:13,590 --> 01:32:13,600
a bunch of different kinds of
 

5609
01:32:13,600 --> 01:32:15,189
a bunch of different kinds of
machine learning applications there's a

5610
01:32:15,189 --> 01:32:15,199
machine learning applications there's a
 

5611
01:32:15,199 --> 01:32:16,310
machine learning applications there's a
cool thing

5612
01:32:16,310 --> 01:32:16,320
cool thing
 

5613
01:32:16,320 --> 01:32:18,550
cool thing
on the distributed storage aspect and

5614
01:32:18,550 --> 01:32:18,560
on the distributed storage aspect and
 

5615
01:32:18,560 --> 01:32:20,229
on the distributed storage aspect and
all that kind of stuff so one of the

5616
01:32:20,229 --> 01:32:20,239
all that kind of stuff so one of the
 

5617
01:32:20,239 --> 01:32:22,070
all that kind of stuff so one of the
applications that i think is super

5618
01:32:22,070 --> 01:32:22,080
applications that i think is super
 

5619
01:32:22,080 --> 01:32:24,550
applications that i think is super
exciting is translation

5620
01:32:24,550 --> 01:32:24,560
exciting is translation
 

5621
01:32:24,560 --> 01:32:27,030
exciting is translation
real-time translation i mentioned to you

5622
01:32:27,030 --> 01:32:27,040
real-time translation i mentioned to you
 

5623
01:32:27,040 --> 01:32:29,030
real-time translation i mentioned to you
that you know having a conversation i

5624
01:32:29,030 --> 01:32:29,040
that you know having a conversation i
 

5625
01:32:29,040 --> 01:32:31,030
that you know having a conversation i
speak russian fluently i speak english

how can we have that communication go

5642
01:32:47,430 --> 01:32:47,440
how can we have that communication go
 

5643
01:32:47,440 --> 01:32:50,070
how can we have that communication go
well with the help of ai i think it's

5644
01:32:50,070 --> 01:32:50,080
well with the help of ai i think it's
 

5645
01:32:50,080 --> 01:32:51,750
well with the help of ai i think it's
such a beautiful and a powerful

5646
01:32:51,750 --> 01:32:51,760
such a beautiful and a powerful
 

5647
01:32:51,760 --> 01:32:54,550
such a beautiful and a powerful
application of ai to connect the world

5648
01:32:54,550 --> 01:32:54,560
application of ai to connect the world
 

5649
01:32:54,560 --> 01:32:56,470
application of ai to connect the world
that bridge the gap not necessarily

5650
01:32:56,470 --> 01:32:56,480
that bridge the gap not necessarily
 

5651
01:32:56,480 --> 01:32:58,310
that bridge the gap not necessarily
between me and putin but

5652
01:32:58,310 --> 01:32:58,320
between me and putin but
 

5653
01:32:58,320 --> 01:33:00,149
between me and putin but
people that don't have that shared

5654
01:33:00,149 --> 01:33:00,159
people that don't have that shared
 

5655
01:33:00,159 --> 01:33:01,830
people that don't have that shared
language

5656
01:33:01,830 --> 01:33:01,840
language
 

5657
01:33:01,840 --> 01:33:03,110
language
can you just speak about your vision

5658
01:33:03,110 --> 01:33:03,120
can you just speak about your vision
 

5659
01:33:03,120 --> 01:33:04,550
can you just speak about your vision
with translation because i think that's

5660
01:33:04,550 --> 01:33:04,560
with translation because i think that's
 

5661
01:33:04,560 --> 01:33:06,629
with translation because i think that's
a really exciting application

5662
01:33:06,629 --> 01:33:06,639
a really exciting application
 

5663
01:33:06,639 --> 01:33:07,910
a really exciting application
if you're trying to help people connect

5664
01:33:07,910 --> 01:33:07,920
if you're trying to help people connect
 

5665
01:33:07,920 --> 01:33:09,189
if you're trying to help people connect
all around the world

5666
01:33:09,189 --> 01:33:09,199
all around the world
 

5667
01:33:09,199 --> 01:33:10,709
all around the world
you know a lot of content is produced in

5668
01:33:10,709 --> 01:33:10,719
you know a lot of content is produced in
 

5669
01:33:10,719 --> 01:33:13,350
you know a lot of content is produced in
one language and people and all these

5670
01:33:13,350 --> 01:33:13,360
one language and people and all these
 

5671
01:33:13,360 --> 01:33:15,110
one language and people and all these
other places are interested in it so

5672
01:33:15,110 --> 01:33:15,120
other places are interested in it so
 

5673
01:33:15,120 --> 01:33:16,870
other places are interested in it so
being able to translate that

5674
01:33:16,870 --> 01:33:16,880
being able to translate that
 

5675
01:33:16,880 --> 01:33:19,030
being able to translate that
um just unlocks a lot of value on a

5676
01:33:19,030 --> 01:33:19,040
um just unlocks a lot of value on a
 

5677
01:33:19,040 --> 01:33:20,390
um just unlocks a lot of value on a
day-to-day basis

5678
01:33:20,390 --> 01:33:20,400
day-to-day basis
 

5679
01:33:20,400 --> 01:33:22,629
day-to-day basis
and so the the kind of ai

5680
01:33:22,629 --> 01:33:22,639
and so the the kind of ai
 

5681
01:33:22,639 --> 01:33:24,229
and so the the kind of ai
around translation is interesting

5682
01:33:24,229 --> 01:33:24,239
around translation is interesting
 

5683
01:33:24,239 --> 01:33:26,149
around translation is interesting
because it's gone through a bunch of

5684
01:33:26,149 --> 01:33:26,159
because it's gone through a bunch of
 

5685
01:33:26,159 --> 01:33:28,310
because it's gone through a bunch of
um a bunch of iterations but the basic

5686
01:33:28,310 --> 01:33:28,320
um a bunch of iterations but the basic
 

5687
01:33:28,320 --> 01:33:29,590
um a bunch of iterations but the basic
state of the art

5688
01:33:29,590 --> 01:33:29,600
state of the art
 

5689
01:33:29,600 --> 01:33:31,030
state of the art
is that

5690
01:33:31,030 --> 01:33:31,040
is that
 

5691
01:33:31,040 --> 01:33:33,110
is that
you don't want to go through

5692
01:33:33,110 --> 01:33:33,120
you don't want to go through
 

5693
01:33:33,120 --> 01:33:35,030
you don't want to go through
you know different kind of

5694
01:33:35,030 --> 01:33:35,040
you know different kind of
 

5695
01:33:35,040 --> 01:33:37,910
you know different kind of
um you know intermediate symbolic

5696
01:33:37,910 --> 01:33:37,920
um you know intermediate symbolic
 

5697
01:33:37,920 --> 01:33:38,790
um you know intermediate symbolic
um

5698
01:33:38,790 --> 01:33:38,800
um
 

5699
01:33:38,800 --> 01:33:41,590
um
representations of of of language or

5700
01:33:41,590 --> 01:33:41,600
representations of of of language or
 

5701
01:33:41,600 --> 01:33:43,110
representations of of of language or
something like that it's you basically

5702
01:33:43,110 --> 01:33:43,120
something like that it's you basically
 

5703
01:33:43,120 --> 01:33:44,870
something like that it's you basically
want to be able to

5704
01:33:44,870 --> 01:33:44,880
want to be able to
 

5705
01:33:44,880 --> 01:33:45,669
want to be able to
map

5706
01:33:45,669 --> 01:33:45,679
map
 

5707
01:33:45,679 --> 01:33:47,669
map
the the concepts and basically go

5708
01:33:47,669 --> 01:33:47,679
the the concepts and basically go
 

5709
01:33:47,679 --> 01:33:49,189
the the concepts and basically go
directly from one language to another

5710
01:33:49,189 --> 01:33:49,199
directly from one language to another
 

5711
01:33:49,199 --> 01:33:51,110
directly from one language to another
and you just can train

5712
01:33:51,110 --> 01:33:51,120
and you just can train
 

5713
01:33:51,120 --> 01:33:53,270
and you just can train
um bigger and bigger models in order to

5714
01:33:53,270 --> 01:33:53,280
um bigger and bigger models in order to
 

5715
01:33:53,280 --> 01:33:55,750
um bigger and bigger models in order to
be able to do that and that's where the

5716
01:33:55,750 --> 01:33:55,760
be able to do that and that's where the
 

5717
01:33:55,760 --> 01:33:57,830
be able to do that and that's where the
the um the research supercluster comes

5718
01:33:57,830 --> 01:33:57,840
the um the research supercluster comes
 

5719
01:33:57,840 --> 01:34:00,149
the um the research supercluster comes
in is basically a lot of the trend in in

5720
01:34:00,149 --> 01:34:00,159
in is basically a lot of the trend in in
 

5721
01:34:00,159 --> 01:34:01,750
in is basically a lot of the trend in in
in machine learning is just you're

5722
01:34:01,750 --> 01:34:01,760
in machine learning is just you're
 

5723
01:34:01,760 --> 01:34:03,350
in machine learning is just you're
building bigger and bigger models and

5724
01:34:03,350 --> 01:34:03,360
building bigger and bigger models and
 

5725
01:34:03,360 --> 01:34:04,709
building bigger and bigger models and
you just need a lot of computation to

5726
01:34:04,709 --> 01:34:04,719
you just need a lot of computation to
 

5727
01:34:04,719 --> 01:34:07,189
you just need a lot of computation to
train them so it's not that like

5728
01:34:07,189 --> 01:34:07,199
train them so it's not that like
 

5729
01:34:07,199 --> 01:34:08,470
train them so it's not that like
the translation would run on the

5730
01:34:08,470 --> 01:34:08,480
the translation would run on the
 

5731
01:34:08,480 --> 01:34:11,350
the translation would run on the
supercomputer the training of the model

5732
01:34:11,350 --> 01:34:11,360
supercomputer the training of the model
 

5733
01:34:11,360 --> 01:34:12,310
supercomputer the training of the model
um

5734
01:34:12,310 --> 01:34:12,320
um
 

5735
01:34:12,320 --> 01:34:14,310
um
which could have you know billions or

5736
01:34:14,310 --> 01:34:14,320
which could have you know billions or
 

5737
01:34:14,320 --> 01:34:17,189
which could have you know billions or
trillions of examples of you know just

5738
01:34:17,189 --> 01:34:17,199
trillions of examples of you know just
 

5739
01:34:17,199 --> 01:34:19,750
trillions of examples of you know just
basically that um you're you're training

5740
01:34:19,750 --> 01:34:19,760
basically that um you're you're training
 

5741
01:34:19,760 --> 01:34:23,110
basically that um you're you're training
models on this super cluster in

5742
01:34:23,110 --> 01:34:23,120
models on this super cluster in
 

5743
01:34:23,120 --> 01:34:25,430
models on this super cluster in
you know days or weeks that might take

5744
01:34:25,430 --> 01:34:25,440
you know days or weeks that might take
 

5745
01:34:25,440 --> 01:34:27,189
you know days or weeks that might take
um a much longer period of time on a

5746
01:34:27,189 --> 01:34:27,199
um a much longer period of time on a
 

5747
01:34:27,199 --> 01:34:28,629
um a much longer period of time on a
smaller cluster so it just wouldn't be

5748
01:34:28,629 --> 01:34:28,639
smaller cluster so it just wouldn't be
 

5749
01:34:28,639 --> 01:34:30,870
smaller cluster so it just wouldn't be
practical for most teams to do but the

5750
01:34:30,870 --> 01:34:30,880
practical for most teams to do but the
 

5751
01:34:30,880 --> 01:34:32,470
practical for most teams to do but the
the translation work

5752
01:34:32,470 --> 01:34:32,480
the translation work
 

5753
01:34:32,480 --> 01:34:34,629
the translation work
um

5754
01:34:34,629 --> 01:34:34,639
um
 

5755
01:34:34,639 --> 01:34:37,110
um
we we're basically getting from

5756
01:34:37,110 --> 01:34:37,120
we we're basically getting from
 

5757
01:34:37,120 --> 01:34:38,709
we we're basically getting from
you know being able to go between about

5758
01:34:38,709 --> 01:34:38,719
you know being able to go between about
 

5759
01:34:38,719 --> 01:34:41,189
you know being able to go between about
100 languages seamlessly today

um
 

5763
01:34:42,159 --> 01:34:44,070
um
to being able to go to about 300

5764
01:34:44,070 --> 01:34:44,080
to being able to go to about 300
 

5765
01:34:44,080 --> 01:34:45,430
to being able to go to about 300
languages

5766
01:34:45,430 --> 01:34:45,440
languages
 

5767
01:34:45,440 --> 01:34:47,270
languages
in the near term and so from any

5768
01:34:47,270 --> 01:34:47,280
in the near term and so from any
 

5769
01:34:47,280 --> 01:34:48,950
in the near term and so from any
language to any other language yeah then

5770
01:34:48,950 --> 01:34:48,960
language to any other language yeah then
 

5771
01:34:48,960 --> 01:34:50,629
language to any other language yeah then
that's and and part of the issue when

5772
01:34:50,629 --> 01:34:50,639
that's and and part of the issue when
 

5773
01:34:50,639 --> 01:34:52,870
that's and and part of the issue when
you get closer to you know

5774
01:34:52,870 --> 01:34:52,880
you get closer to you know
 

5775
01:34:52,880 --> 01:34:55,030
you get closer to you know
more languages is

5776
01:34:55,030 --> 01:34:55,040
more languages is
 

5777
01:34:55,040 --> 01:34:57,350
more languages is
some of these get to be you know pretty

5778
01:34:57,350 --> 01:34:57,360
some of these get to be you know pretty
 

5779
01:34:57,360 --> 01:35:00,070
some of these get to be you know pretty
um

5780
01:35:00,070 --> 01:35:00,080
um
 

5781
01:35:00,080 --> 01:35:02,709
um
very popular languages right where there

5782
01:35:02,709 --> 01:35:02,719
very popular languages right where there
 

5783
01:35:02,719 --> 01:35:05,669
very popular languages right where there
isn't that much content in them so um so

5784
01:35:05,669 --> 01:35:05,679
isn't that much content in them so um so
 

5785
01:35:05,679 --> 01:35:07,350
isn't that much content in them so um so
you you end up having less data and you

5786
01:35:07,350 --> 01:35:07,360
you you end up having less data and you
 

5787
01:35:07,360 --> 01:35:09,430
you you end up having less data and you
need to kind of use

5788
01:35:09,430 --> 01:35:09,440
need to kind of use
 

5789
01:35:09,440 --> 01:35:11,109
need to kind of use
a model that you've built up around

5790
01:35:11,109 --> 01:35:11,119
a model that you've built up around
 

5791
01:35:11,119 --> 01:35:12,950
a model that you've built up around
other examples and this is one of the

5792
01:35:12,950 --> 01:35:12,960
other examples and this is one of the
 

5793
01:35:12,960 --> 01:35:14,310
other examples and this is one of the
big questions around ai is like how

5794
01:35:14,310 --> 01:35:14,320
big questions around ai is like how
 

5795
01:35:14,320 --> 01:35:17,350
big questions around ai is like how
generalizable can things be um and and

5796
01:35:17,350 --> 01:35:17,360
generalizable can things be um and and
 

5797
01:35:17,360 --> 01:35:18,550
generalizable can things be um and and
that's that i think is one of the things

5798
01:35:18,550 --> 01:35:18,560
that's that i think is one of the things
 

5799
01:35:18,560 --> 01:35:19,910
that's that i think is one of the things
that's just kind of exciting here from a

5800
01:35:19,910 --> 01:35:19,920
that's just kind of exciting here from a
 

5801
01:35:19,920 --> 01:35:22,390
that's just kind of exciting here from a
technical perspective but capturing we

5802
01:35:22,390 --> 01:35:22,400
technical perspective but capturing we
 

5803
01:35:22,400 --> 01:35:23,669
technical perspective but capturing we
talked about this with the metaverse

5804
01:35:23,669 --> 01:35:23,679
talked about this with the metaverse
 

5805
01:35:23,679 --> 01:35:25,430
talked about this with the metaverse
capturing the magic of human human

5806
01:35:25,430 --> 01:35:25,440
capturing the magic of human human
 

5807
01:35:25,440 --> 01:35:29,030
capturing the magic of human human
interaction so me and putin okay i'm

5808
01:35:29,030 --> 01:35:29,040
interaction so me and putin okay i'm
 

5809
01:35:29,040 --> 01:35:30,550
interaction so me and putin okay i'm
again this is i mean it's a tough

5810
01:35:30,550 --> 01:35:30,560
again this is i mean it's a tough
 

5811
01:35:30,560 --> 01:35:32,390
again this is i mean it's a tough
example because you actually both speak

5812
01:35:32,390 --> 01:35:32,400
example because you actually both speak
 

5813
01:35:32,400 --> 01:35:33,990
example because you actually both speak
russian and english but that's but in

5814
01:35:33,990 --> 01:35:34,000
russian and english but that's but in
 

5815
01:35:34,000 --> 01:35:36,550
russian and english but that's but in
the future i see it as a touring test of

5816
01:35:36,550 --> 01:35:36,560
the future i see it as a touring test of
 

5817
01:35:36,560 --> 01:35:39,189
the future i see it as a touring test of
a kind because we would both like to

5818
01:35:39,189 --> 01:35:39,199
a kind because we would both like to
 

5819
01:35:39,199 --> 01:35:40,709
a kind because we would both like to
have an ai that improves because i don't

5820
01:35:40,709 --> 01:35:40,719
have an ai that improves because i don't
 

5821
01:35:40,719 --> 01:35:42,709
have an ai that improves because i don't
speak russian that well he doesn't speak

5822
01:35:42,709 --> 01:35:42,719
speak russian that well he doesn't speak
 

5823
01:35:42,719 --> 01:35:44,870
speak russian that well he doesn't speak
english that well yeah it would be nice

5824
01:35:44,870 --> 01:35:44,880
english that well yeah it would be nice
 

5825
01:35:44,880 --> 01:35:49,430
english that well yeah it would be nice
to outperform our abilities

5826
01:35:49,430 --> 01:35:49,440
to outperform our abilities
 

5827
01:35:49,440 --> 01:35:50,870
to outperform our abilities
it sets a really nice bar because i

5828
01:35:50,870 --> 01:35:50,880
it sets a really nice bar because i
 

5829
01:35:50,880 --> 01:35:53,430
it sets a really nice bar because i
think ai can really help in translation

5830
01:35:53,430 --> 01:35:53,440
think ai can really help in translation
 

5831
01:35:53,440 --> 01:35:54,870
think ai can really help in translation
for people that don't speak the language

5832
01:35:54,870 --> 01:35:54,880
for people that don't speak the language
 

5833
01:35:54,880 --> 01:35:58,229
for people that don't speak the language
at all but to actually capture the magic

5834
01:35:58,229 --> 01:35:58,239
at all but to actually capture the magic
 

5835
01:35:58,239 --> 01:36:01,350
at all but to actually capture the magic
of the chemistry the translation which

5836
01:36:01,350 --> 01:36:01,360
of the chemistry the translation which
 

5837
01:36:01,360 --> 01:36:03,189
of the chemistry the translation which
would make the metaverse

5838
01:36:03,189 --> 01:36:03,199
would make the metaverse
 

5839
01:36:03,199 --> 01:36:04,870
would make the metaverse
super immersive

5840
01:36:04,870 --> 01:36:04,880
super immersive
 

5841
01:36:04,880 --> 01:36:06,950
super immersive
that's exciting you remove the barrier

5842
01:36:06,950 --> 01:36:06,960
that's exciting you remove the barrier
 

5843
01:36:06,960 --> 01:36:08,629
that's exciting you remove the barrier
of language period

5844
01:36:08,629 --> 01:36:08,639
of language period
 

5845
01:36:08,639 --> 01:36:09,669
of language period
yeah so

5846
01:36:09,669 --> 01:36:09,679
yeah so
 

5847
01:36:09,679 --> 01:36:11,189
yeah so
when people think about translation i

5848
01:36:11,189 --> 01:36:11,199
when people think about translation i
 

5849
01:36:11,199 --> 01:36:12,709
when people think about translation i
think a lot of that is they're thinking

5850
01:36:12,709 --> 01:36:12,719
think a lot of that is they're thinking
 

5851
01:36:12,719 --> 01:36:14,870
think a lot of that is they're thinking
about text to text but

5852
01:36:14,870 --> 01:36:14,880
about text to text but
 

5853
01:36:14,880 --> 01:36:16,390
about text to text but
speech to speech i think is a whole

5854
01:36:16,390 --> 01:36:16,400
speech to speech i think is a whole
 

5855
01:36:16,400 --> 01:36:18,229
speech to speech i think is a whole
nother thing and i mean one of the big

5856
01:36:18,229 --> 01:36:18,239
nother thing and i mean one of the big
 

5857
01:36:18,239 --> 01:36:20,070
nother thing and i mean one of the big
lessons on that which i was referring to

5858
01:36:20,070 --> 01:36:20,080
lessons on that which i was referring to
 

5859
01:36:20,080 --> 01:36:22,229
lessons on that which i was referring to
before is i think early models it's like

5860
01:36:22,229 --> 01:36:22,239
before is i think early models it's like
 

5861
01:36:22,239 --> 01:36:23,830
before is i think early models it's like
all right they take speech they

5862
01:36:23,830 --> 01:36:23,840
all right they take speech they
 

5863
01:36:23,840 --> 01:36:25,669
all right they take speech they
translate it to text translate the text

5864
01:36:25,669 --> 01:36:25,679
translate it to text translate the text
 

5865
01:36:25,679 --> 01:36:27,430
translate it to text translate the text
to another language and then and then

5866
01:36:27,430 --> 01:36:27,440
to another language and then and then
 

5867
01:36:27,440 --> 01:36:28,870
to another language and then and then
kind of output that as speech in that

5868
01:36:28,870 --> 01:36:28,880
kind of output that as speech in that
 

5869
01:36:28,880 --> 01:36:30,229
kind of output that as speech in that
language and you don't want to do that

5870
01:36:30,229 --> 01:36:30,239
language and you don't want to do that
 

5871
01:36:30,239 --> 01:36:31,590
language and you don't want to do that
you just want to be able to go directly

5872
01:36:31,590 --> 01:36:31,600
you just want to be able to go directly
 

5873
01:36:31,600 --> 01:36:33,270
you just want to be able to go directly
from speech in one language to speech in

5874
01:36:33,270 --> 01:36:33,280
from speech in one language to speech in
 

5875
01:36:33,280 --> 01:36:35,350
from speech in one language to speech in
another language and build up the models

5876
01:36:35,350 --> 01:36:35,360
another language and build up the models
 

5877
01:36:35,360 --> 01:36:37,350
another language and build up the models
to to do that and

5878
01:36:37,350 --> 01:36:37,360
to to do that and
 

5879
01:36:37,360 --> 01:36:39,189
to to do that and
i mean i think one of the

5880
01:36:39,189 --> 01:36:39,199
i mean i think one of the
 

5881
01:36:39,199 --> 01:36:40,550
i mean i think one of the
there have been

5882
01:36:40,550 --> 01:36:40,560
there have been
 

5883
01:36:40,560 --> 01:36:41,990
there have been
when you look at the progress in machine

5884
01:36:41,990 --> 01:36:42,000
when you look at the progress in machine
 

5885
01:36:42,000 --> 01:36:44,229
when you look at the progress in machine
learning there have been

5886
01:36:44,229 --> 01:36:44,239
learning there have been
 

5887
01:36:44,239 --> 01:36:46,390
learning there have been
big advances in the techniques

5888
01:36:46,390 --> 01:36:46,400
big advances in the techniques
 

5889
01:36:46,400 --> 01:36:48,310
big advances in the techniques
um you know some of the

5890
01:36:48,310 --> 01:36:48,320
um you know some of the
 

5891
01:36:48,320 --> 01:36:50,709
um you know some of the
the uh advances in self-supervised

5892
01:36:50,709 --> 01:36:50,719
the uh advances in self-supervised
 

5893
01:36:50,719 --> 01:36:52,390
the uh advances in self-supervised
learning which i know you talked to jan

5894
01:36:52,390 --> 01:36:52,400
learning which i know you talked to jan
 

5895
01:36:52,400 --> 01:36:54,229
learning which i know you talked to jan
about and he's like one of the leading

5896
01:36:54,229 --> 01:36:54,239
about and he's like one of the leading
 

5897
01:36:54,239 --> 01:36:55,590
about and he's like one of the leading
thinkers in this area i just think that

5898
01:36:55,590 --> 01:36:55,600
thinkers in this area i just think that
 

5899
01:36:55,600 --> 01:36:57,590
thinkers in this area i just think that
that stuff is really exciting but then

5900
01:36:57,590 --> 01:36:57,600
that stuff is really exciting but then
 

5901
01:36:57,600 --> 01:37:00,070
that stuff is really exciting but then
you couple that with the ability to just

5902
01:37:00,070 --> 01:37:00,080
you couple that with the ability to just
 

5903
01:37:00,080 --> 01:37:01,910
you couple that with the ability to just
throw larger and larger amounts of

5904
01:37:01,910 --> 01:37:01,920
throw larger and larger amounts of
 

5905
01:37:01,920 --> 01:37:04,070
throw larger and larger amounts of
compute at training these models

5906
01:37:04,070 --> 01:37:04,080
compute at training these models
 

5907
01:37:04,080 --> 01:37:05,590
compute at training these models
and you can just do a lot of things that

5908
01:37:05,590 --> 01:37:05,600
and you can just do a lot of things that
 

5909
01:37:05,600 --> 01:37:07,510
and you can just do a lot of things that
um that that uh

5910
01:37:07,510 --> 01:37:07,520
um that that uh
 

5911
01:37:07,520 --> 01:37:09,510
um that that uh
were harder to do before but we're

5912
01:37:09,510 --> 01:37:09,520
were harder to do before but we're
 

5913
01:37:09,520 --> 01:37:12,550
were harder to do before but we're
asking more of um of our systems too

5914
01:37:12,550 --> 01:37:12,560
asking more of um of our systems too
 

5915
01:37:12,560 --> 01:37:14,070
asking more of um of our systems too
right so you know if you think about the

5916
01:37:14,070 --> 01:37:14,080
right so you know if you think about the
 

5917
01:37:14,080 --> 01:37:16,390
right so you know if you think about the
applications that we're gonna need

5918
01:37:16,390 --> 01:37:16,400
applications that we're gonna need
 

5919
01:37:16,400 --> 01:37:18,950
applications that we're gonna need
for the metaverse um or think about it

5920
01:37:18,950 --> 01:37:18,960
for the metaverse um or think about it
 

5921
01:37:18,960 --> 01:37:21,030
for the metaverse um or think about it
okay so let's talk about ar here for a

5922
01:37:21,030 --> 01:37:21,040
okay so let's talk about ar here for a
 

5923
01:37:21,040 --> 01:37:22,950
okay so let's talk about ar here for a
second you're gonna have these glasses

5924
01:37:22,950 --> 01:37:22,960
second you're gonna have these glasses
 

5925
01:37:22,960 --> 01:37:24,229
second you're gonna have these glasses
they're gonna look

5926
01:37:24,229 --> 01:37:24,239
they're gonna look
 

5927
01:37:24,239 --> 01:37:26,550
they're gonna look
hopefully like a normal-ish looking pair

5928
01:37:26,550 --> 01:37:26,560
hopefully like a normal-ish looking pair
 

5929
01:37:26,560 --> 01:37:28,470
hopefully like a normal-ish looking pair
of glasses um but they're gonna be able

5930
01:37:28,470 --> 01:37:28,480
of glasses um but they're gonna be able
 

5931
01:37:28,480 --> 01:37:29,750
of glasses um but they're gonna be able
to

5932
01:37:29,750 --> 01:37:29,760
to
 

5933
01:37:29,760 --> 01:37:32,390
to
put holograms in the world and intermix

5934
01:37:32,390 --> 01:37:32,400
put holograms in the world and intermix
 

5935
01:37:32,400 --> 01:37:34,709
put holograms in the world and intermix
virtual and physical objects in in your

5936
01:37:34,709 --> 01:37:34,719
virtual and physical objects in in your
 

5937
01:37:34,719 --> 01:37:36,629
virtual and physical objects in in your
in your scene and one of the things

5938
01:37:36,629 --> 01:37:36,639
in your scene and one of the things
 

5939
01:37:36,639 --> 01:37:38,470
in your scene and one of the things
that's going to be unique

5940
01:37:38,470 --> 01:37:38,480
that's going to be unique
 

5941
01:37:38,480 --> 01:37:40,310
that's going to be unique
about this compared to every other

5942
01:37:40,310 --> 01:37:40,320
about this compared to every other
 

5943
01:37:40,320 --> 01:37:42,390
about this compared to every other
computing device that you've had before

5944
01:37:42,390 --> 01:37:42,400
computing device that you've had before
 

5945
01:37:42,400 --> 01:37:43,669
computing device that you've had before
is that this is going to be the first

5946
01:37:43,669 --> 01:37:43,679
is that this is going to be the first
 

5947
01:37:43,679 --> 01:37:45,109
is that this is going to be the first
computing device

5948
01:37:45,109 --> 01:37:45,119
computing device
 

5949
01:37:45,119 --> 01:37:47,510
computing device
that has all the same signals about

5950
01:37:47,510 --> 01:37:47,520
that has all the same signals about
 

5951
01:37:47,520 --> 01:37:49,189
that has all the same signals about
what's going on around you that you have

video
 

5959
01:37:54,000 --> 01:37:56,310
video
but i mean these glasses are gonna you

5960
01:37:56,310 --> 01:37:56,320
but i mean these glasses are gonna you
 

5961
01:37:56,320 --> 01:37:57,430
but i mean these glasses are gonna you
know whenever you activate them they're

5962
01:37:57,430 --> 01:37:57,440
know whenever you activate them they're
 

5963
01:37:57,440 --> 01:37:59,030
know whenever you activate them they're
gonna be able to see what you see from

gonna be able to see what you see from
 

5965
01:37:59,040 --> 01:38:00,470
gonna be able to see what you see from
your perspective they're gonna be able

5966
01:38:00,470 --> 01:38:00,480
your perspective they're gonna be able
 

5967
01:38:00,480 --> 01:38:01,910
your perspective they're gonna be able
to hear what you hear because they're

you're gonna want an ai assistant that's

5974
01:38:08,149 --> 01:38:08,159
you're gonna want an ai assistant that's
 

5975
01:38:08,159 --> 01:38:10,229
you're gonna want an ai assistant that's
a new kind of ai assistant

5976
01:38:10,229 --> 01:38:10,239
a new kind of ai assistant
 

5977
01:38:10,239 --> 01:38:11,109
a new kind of ai assistant
that

5978
01:38:11,109 --> 01:38:11,119
that
 

5979
01:38:11,119 --> 01:38:13,830
that
can basically help you process the world

5980
01:38:13,830 --> 01:38:13,840
can basically help you process the world
 

5981
01:38:13,840 --> 01:38:16,950
can basically help you process the world
from this first person perspective or

5982
01:38:16,950 --> 01:38:16,960
from this first person perspective or
 

5983
01:38:16,960 --> 01:38:18,950
from this first person perspective or
from the perspective that you have and

5984
01:38:18,950 --> 01:38:18,960
from the perspective that you have and
 

5985
01:38:18,960 --> 01:38:21,669
from the perspective that you have and
the utility of that is going to be huge

5986
01:38:21,669 --> 01:38:21,679
the utility of that is going to be huge
 

5987
01:38:21,679 --> 01:38:22,629
the utility of that is going to be huge
but

5988
01:38:22,629 --> 01:38:22,639
but
 

5989
01:38:22,639 --> 01:38:24,390
but
the kinds of ai models that we're going

5990
01:38:24,390 --> 01:38:24,400
the kinds of ai models that we're going
 

5991
01:38:24,400 --> 01:38:26,629
the kinds of ai models that we're going
to need are going to be

5992
01:38:26,629 --> 01:38:26,639
to need are going to be
 

5993
01:38:26,639 --> 01:38:28,390
to need are going to be
just um

5994
01:38:28,390 --> 01:38:28,400
just um
 

5995
01:38:28,400 --> 01:38:29,510
just um
i don't know there's a lot that we're

5996
01:38:29,510 --> 01:38:29,520
i don't know there's a lot that we're
 

5997
01:38:29,520 --> 01:38:31,590
i don't know there's a lot that we're
going to need to basically make advances

5998
01:38:31,590 --> 01:38:31,600
going to need to basically make advances
 

5999
01:38:31,600 --> 01:38:32,870
going to need to basically make advances
in but i mean but that's why i think

6000
01:38:32,870 --> 01:38:32,880
in but i mean but that's why i think
 

6001
01:38:32,880 --> 01:38:35,030
in but i mean but that's why i think
these concepts of the metaverse and and

6002
01:38:35,030 --> 01:38:35,040
these concepts of the metaverse and and
 

6003
01:38:35,040 --> 01:38:37,109
these concepts of the metaverse and and
and the advances in ai are so

6004
01:38:37,109 --> 01:38:37,119
and the advances in ai are so
 

6005
01:38:37,119 --> 01:38:40,070
and the advances in ai are so
fundamentally interlinked um

6006
01:38:40,070 --> 01:38:40,080
fundamentally interlinked um
 

6007
01:38:40,080 --> 01:38:41,669
fundamentally interlinked um
that i mean they're they're kind of

6008
01:38:41,669 --> 01:38:41,679
that i mean they're they're kind of
 

6009
01:38:41,679 --> 01:38:43,590
that i mean they're they're kind of
enabling each other yeah like the world

6010
01:38:43,590 --> 01:38:43,600
enabling each other yeah like the world
 

6011
01:38:43,600 --> 01:38:45,910
enabling each other yeah like the world
builder is a really cool idea like uh

6012
01:38:45,910 --> 01:38:45,920
builder is a really cool idea like uh
 

6013
01:38:45,920 --> 01:38:47,430
builder is a really cool idea like uh
you can be like a bob ross like i'm

6014

missing a little tree and then but at

6020
01:38:52,070 --> 01:38:52,080
missing a little tree and then but at
 

6021
01:38:52,080 --> 01:38:53,750
missing a little tree and then but at
scale like

6022
01:38:53,750 --> 01:38:53,760
scale like
 

6023
01:38:53,760 --> 01:38:55,270
scale like
enriching your experience in all kinds

6024
01:38:55,270 --> 01:38:55,280
enriching your experience in all kinds
 

6025
01:38:55,280 --> 01:38:56,870
enriching your experience in all kinds
of ways you mentioned the assistant too

6026
01:38:56,870 --> 01:38:56,880
of ways you mentioned the assistant too
 

6027
01:38:56,880 --> 01:38:58,390
of ways you mentioned the assistant too
that's really interesting how you can

6028
01:38:58,390 --> 01:38:58,400
that's really interesting how you can
 

6029
01:38:58,400 --> 01:39:00,790
that's really interesting how you can
have ai assistance helping you out on

6030
01:39:00,790 --> 01:39:00,800
have ai assistance helping you out on
 

6031
01:39:00,800 --> 01:39:02,950

6250
01:42:32,790 --> 01:42:32,800
um but those are that's sort of like
 

6251
01:42:32,800 --> 01:42:35,189
um but those are that's sort of like
if you were to boil down my overall life

6252
01:42:35,189 --> 01:42:35,199
if you were to boil down my overall life
 

6253
01:42:35,199 --> 01:42:38,070
if you were to boil down my overall life
philosophy into what i try to impart to

6254
01:42:38,070 --> 01:42:38,080
philosophy into what i try to impart to
 

6255
01:42:38,080 --> 01:42:39,510
philosophy into what i try to impart to
my my kids

6256
01:42:39,510 --> 01:42:39,520
my my kids
 

6257
01:42:39,520 --> 01:42:41,590
my my kids
um those are the things that i think are

6258
01:42:41,590 --> 01:42:41,600
um those are the things that i think are
 

6259
01:42:41,600 --> 01:42:43,830
um those are the things that i think are
really important so okay so let's say

6260
01:42:43,830 --> 01:42:43,840
really important so okay so let's say
 

6261
01:42:43,840 --> 01:42:45,750
really important so okay so let's say
college so if you're graduating college

6262
01:42:45,750 --> 01:42:45,760
college so if you're graduating college
 

6263
01:42:45,760 --> 01:42:48,070
college so if you're graduating college
probably more practical advice

6264
01:42:48,070 --> 01:42:48,080
probably more practical advice
 

6265
01:42:48,080 --> 01:42:51,189
probably more practical advice
um

6266
01:42:51,189 --> 01:42:51,199

 

6267
01:42:51,199 --> 01:42:55,590

so i'm always very focused on people and

6268
01:42:55,590 --> 01:42:55,600

 

6269
01:42:55,600 --> 01:42:56,950

i think the most important decision

6270
01:42:56,950 --> 01:42:56,960
i think the most important decision
 

6271
01:42:56,960 --> 01:42:57,990
i think the most important decision
you're probably going to make if you're

6272
01:42:57,990 --> 01:42:58,000
you're probably going to make if you're
 

6273
01:42:58,000 --> 01:42:59,270
you're probably going to make if you're
in college

6274
01:42:59,270 --> 01:42:59,280
in college
 

6275
01:42:59,280 --> 01:43:01,510
in college
is who you surround yourself with

6276
01:43:01,510 --> 01:43:01,520
is who you surround yourself with
 

6277
01:43:01,520 --> 01:43:02,950
is who you surround yourself with
because you become like the people you

6278
01:43:02,950 --> 01:43:02,960
because you become like the people you
 

6279
01:43:02,960 --> 01:43:04,550
because you become like the people you
surround yourself with

6280
01:43:04,550 --> 01:43:04,560
surround yourself with
 

6281
01:43:04,560 --> 01:43:06,550
surround yourself with
and

6282
01:43:06,550 --> 01:43:06,560
and
 

6283
01:43:06,560 --> 01:43:09,430
and
i i sort of have

6284
01:43:09,430 --> 01:43:09,440
i i sort of have
 

6285
01:43:09,440 --> 01:43:12,310
i i sort of have
this hiring heuristic at meta

6286
01:43:12,310 --> 01:43:12,320
this hiring heuristic at meta
 

6287
01:43:12,320 --> 01:43:14,790
this hiring heuristic at meta
which is that i will only hire someone

6288
01:43:14,790 --> 01:43:14,800
which is that i will only hire someone
 

6289
01:43:14,800 --> 01:43:16,149
which is that i will only hire someone
to work for me

6290
01:43:16,149 --> 01:43:16,159
to work for me
 

6291
01:43:16,159 --> 01:43:17,510
to work for me
if

6292
01:43:17,510 --> 01:43:17,520
if
 

6293
01:43:17,520 --> 01:43:19,830
if
i could see myself working for them not

6294
01:43:19,830 --> 01:43:19,840
i could see myself working for them not
 

6295
01:43:19,840 --> 01:43:21,109
i could see myself working for them not
necessarily that i want them to run the

6296
01:43:21,109 --> 01:43:21,119
necessarily that i want them to run the
 

6297
01:43:21,119 --> 01:43:23,350
necessarily that i want them to run the
company because i like my job but like

6298
01:43:23,350 --> 01:43:23,360
company because i like my job but like
 

6299
01:43:23,360 --> 01:43:25,030
company because i like my job but like
but but in an alternate universe if it

6300
01:43:25,030 --> 01:43:25,040
but but in an alternate universe if it
 

6301
01:43:25,040 --> 01:43:26,629
but but in an alternate universe if it
was their company and i was looking to

6302
01:43:26,629 --> 01:43:26,639
was their company and i was looking to
 

6303
01:43:26,639 --> 01:43:28,950
was their company and i was looking to
to go work somewhere um would i be happy

6304
01:43:28,950 --> 01:43:28,960
to go work somewhere um would i be happy
 

6305
01:43:28,960 --> 01:43:30,870
to go work somewhere um would i be happy
to work for them and i think that

6306
01:43:30,870 --> 01:43:30,880
to work for them and i think that
 

6307
01:43:30,880 --> 01:43:33,830
to work for them and i think that
that's a helpful heuristic

6308
01:43:33,830 --> 01:43:33,840
that's a helpful heuristic
 

6309
01:43:33,840 --> 01:43:35,590
that's a helpful heuristic
to help balance you know when you're

6310
01:43:35,590 --> 01:43:35,600
to help balance you know when you're
 

6311
01:43:35,600 --> 01:43:36,709
to help balance you know when you're
building something like this there's a

6312
01:43:36,709 --> 01:43:36,719
building something like this there's a
 

6313
01:43:36,719 --> 01:43:38,870
building something like this there's a
lot of pressure to you know you want to

6314
01:43:38,870 --> 01:43:38,880
lot of pressure to you know you want to
 

6315
01:43:38,880 --> 01:43:40,070
lot of pressure to you know you want to
build out your teams because there's a

6316
01:43:40,070 --> 01:43:40,080
build out your teams because there's a
 

6317
01:43:40,080 --> 01:43:41,270
build out your teams because there's a
lot of stuff that you need to get done

6318
01:43:41,270 --> 01:43:41,280
lot of stuff that you need to get done
 

6319
01:43:41,280 --> 01:43:42,629
lot of stuff that you need to get done
and then everyone always says don't

6320
01:43:42,629 --> 01:43:42,639
and then everyone always says don't
 

6321
01:43:42,639 --> 01:43:44,390
and then everyone always says don't
compromise on quality but there's this

6322
01:43:44,390 --> 01:43:44,400
compromise on quality but there's this
 

6323
01:43:44,400 --> 01:43:45,430
compromise on quality but there's this
question of okay how do you know that

6324
01:43:45,430 --> 01:43:45,440
question of okay how do you know that
 

6325
01:43:45,440 --> 01:43:46,709
question of okay how do you know that
someone is good enough and i think my

6326
01:43:46,709 --> 01:43:46,719
someone is good enough and i think my
 

6327
01:43:46,719 --> 01:43:48,070
someone is good enough and i think my
answer is

6328
01:43:48,070 --> 01:43:48,080
answer is
 

6329
01:43:48,080 --> 01:43:50,390
answer is
i would want someone to be to be on my

6330
01:43:50,390 --> 01:43:50,400
i would want someone to be to be on my
 

6331
01:43:50,400 --> 01:43:52,709
i would want someone to be to be on my
team if i would work for them

6332
01:43:52,709 --> 01:43:52,719
team if i would work for them
 

6333
01:43:52,719 --> 01:43:53,830
team if i would work for them
but i think it's actually a pretty

6334
01:43:53,830 --> 01:43:53,840
but i think it's actually a pretty
 

6335
01:43:53,840 --> 01:43:55,350
but i think it's actually a pretty
similar answer

6336
01:43:55,350 --> 01:43:55,360
similar answer
 

6337
01:43:55,360 --> 01:43:56,709
similar answer

6370
01:44:27,109 --> 01:44:27,119
about and they're going to like um and
 

6371

01:44:31,669 --> 01:44:31,679
experiences that that are kind of more
 

6377
01:44:31,679 --> 01:44:33,030
experiences that that are kind of more
of what you want to become like over

6378
01:44:33,030 --> 01:44:33,040
of what you want to become like over
 

6379
01:44:33,040 --> 01:44:35,109
of what you want to become like over
time so i don't know i think probably

6380
01:44:35,109 --> 01:44:35,119
time so i don't know i think probably
 

6381
01:44:35,119 --> 01:44:36,870
time so i don't know i think probably
people are too

6382
01:44:36,870 --> 01:44:36,880
people are too
 

6383
01:44:36,880 --> 01:44:39,510
people are too
in general objective focused and maybe

6384
01:44:39,510 --> 01:44:39,520
in general objective focused and maybe
 

6385
01:44:39,520 --> 01:44:41,669
in general objective focused and maybe
not focused enough on

6386
01:44:41,669 --> 01:44:41,679
not focused enough on
 

6387
01:44:41,679 --> 01:44:43,270
not focused enough on
the connections and

6388
01:44:43,270 --> 01:44:43,280
the connections and
 

6389
01:44:43,280 --> 01:44:44,550
the connections and
the people who they're who they're

6390
01:44:44,550 --> 01:44:44,560
the people who they're who they're
 

6391
01:44:44,560 --> 01:44:46,870
the people who they're who they're
basically building relationships with i

6392
01:44:46,870 --> 01:44:46,880
basically building relationships with i
 

6393

6635
01:48:54,400 --> 01:48:57,189
want to build and want to does it freak
you out that it's finite though

6636
01:48:57,189 --> 01:48:57,199
you out that it's finite though
 

6637
01:48:57,199 --> 01:48:59,030
you out that it's finite though
that there's a deadline when it's all

6638
01:48:59,030 --> 01:48:59,040
that there's a deadline when it's all
 

6639
01:48:59,040 --> 01:49:01,109
that there's a deadline when it's all
over

6640
01:49:01,109 --> 01:49:01,119
over
 

6641
01:49:01,119 --> 01:49:02,470
over
and there'll be a time when your

6642
01:49:02,470 --> 01:49:02,480
and there'll be a time when your
 

6643
01:49:02,480 --> 01:49:05,030

6649
01:49:13,760 --> 01:49:16,149

constraints are helpful

6650
01:49:16,149 --> 01:49:16,159
constraints are helpful
 

6651
01:49:16,159 --> 01:49:17,189
constraints are helpful
yeah

6652
01:49:17,189 --> 01:49:17,199
yeah
 

6653
01:49:17,199 --> 01:49:19,669
yeah
yeah the finiteness is uh makes makes

6654
01:49:19,669 --> 01:49:19,679
yeah the finiteness is uh makes makes
 

6655
01:49:19,679 --> 01:49:21,589
yeah the finiteness is uh makes makes
ice cream taste more delicious somehow

6656
01:49:21,589 --> 01:49:21,599
ice cream taste more delicious somehow
 

6657
01:49:21,599 --> 01:49:23,030
ice cream taste more delicious somehow
the fact that it's going to be over

6658
01:49:23,030 --> 01:49:23,040
the fact that it's going to be over
 

6659
01:49:23,040 --> 01:49:24,229
the fact that it's going to be over
there's something about that with the

6660
01:49:24,229 --> 01:49:24,239
there's something about that with the
 

6661
01:49:24,239 --> 01:49:25,589
there's something about that with the
metaverse too

6662
01:49:25,589 --> 01:49:25,599
metaverse too
 

6663
01:49:25,599 --> 01:49:27,990
metaverse too
you want we talked about this identity

6664
01:49:27,990 --> 01:49:28,000
you want we talked about this identity
 

6665
01:49:28,000 --> 01:49:29,510
you want we talked about this identity
earlier like having just one with like

6666
01:49:29,510 --> 01:49:29,520
earlier like having just one with like
 

6667
01:49:29,520 --> 01:49:32,870
earlier like having just one with like
nfts there's something powerful about

6668
01:49:32,870 --> 01:49:32,880
nfts there's something powerful about
 

6669
01:49:32,880 --> 01:49:35,430
nfts there's something powerful about
the the constraint of finiteness or

6670
01:49:35,430 --> 01:49:35,440
the the constraint of finiteness or
 

6671
01:49:35,440 --> 01:49:36,790
the the constraint of finiteness or
uniqueness

6672
01:49:36,790 --> 01:49:36,800
uniqueness
 

6673

uniqueness
that this moment is singular in history

6674
01:49:39,669 --> 01:49:39,679
that this moment is singular in history
 

6675
01:49:39,679 --> 01:49:41,350
that this moment is singular in history
but i mean a lot of you know as you go

6676
01:49:41,350 --> 01:49:41,360
but i mean a lot of you know as you go
 

6677
01:49:41,360 --> 01:49:42,709
but i mean a lot of you know as you go
through different waves of technology i

6678
01:49:42,709 --> 01:49:42,719
through different waves of technology i
 

6679
01:49:42,719 --> 01:49:44,310
through different waves of technology i
think a lot of what is interesting is

6680
01:49:44,310 --> 01:49:44,320
think a lot of what is interesting is
 

6681
01:49:44,320 --> 01:49:46,790
think a lot of what is interesting is
what becomes

6682
01:49:46,790 --> 01:49:46,800
what becomes
 

6683
01:49:46,800 --> 01:49:49,189
what becomes
in practice infinite or or kind of there

6684
01:49:49,189 --> 01:49:49,199
in practice infinite or or kind of there
 

6685
01:49:49,199 --> 01:49:51,750
in practice infinite or or kind of there
can be many many of a thing and then

6686
01:49:51,750 --> 01:49:51,760
can be many many of a thing and then
 

6687
01:49:51,760 --> 01:49:54,310
can be many many of a thing and then
what ends up still being constrained so

6688
01:49:54,310 --> 01:49:54,320
what ends up still being constrained so
 

6689
01:49:54,320 --> 01:49:57,750
what ends up still being constrained so
the metaverse um

6690
01:49:57,750 --> 01:49:57,760
the metaverse um
 

6691
01:49:57,760 --> 01:50:00,310
the metaverse um
should hopefully allow

6692
01:50:00,310 --> 01:50:00,320
should hopefully allow
 

6693
01:50:00,320 --> 01:50:03,189
should hopefully allow
a very large number or maybe you know in

6694
01:50:03,189 --> 01:50:03,199
a very large number or maybe you know in
 

6695
01:50:03,199 --> 01:50:04,149
a very large number or maybe you know in
practice

6696
01:50:04,149 --> 01:50:04,159
practice
 

6697
01:50:04,159 --> 01:50:06,149
practice
hopefully close to an infinite amount of

6698
01:50:06,149 --> 01:50:06,159
hopefully close to an infinite amount of
 

6699
01:50:06,159 --> 01:50:08,790
hopefully close to an infinite amount of
expression and worlds and

6700
01:50:08,790 --> 01:50:08,800
expression and worlds and
 

6701
01:50:08,800 --> 01:50:10,070
expression and worlds and
but we'll still only have a finite

6702
01:50:10,070 --> 01:50:10,080
but we'll still only have a finite
 

6703
01:50:10,080 --> 01:50:15,589
but we'll still only have a finite
amount of time yes i i think

6704
01:50:15,589 --> 01:50:15,599

 

6705
01:50:15,599 --> 01:50:17,830

i mean living longer i think is good

6706
01:50:17,830 --> 01:50:17,840
i mean living longer i think is good
 

6707
01:50:17,840 --> 01:50:19,669
i mean living longer i think is good
i know obviously all of my

our philanthropic work is
 

6711
01:50:21,599 --> 01:50:23,430
our philanthropic work is
it's it's not focused on longevity but

6877
01:53:18,560 --> 01:53:20,310
things that i think you str i struggle
with at least

6878
01:53:20,310 --> 01:53:20,320
with at least
 

6879
01:53:20,320 --> 01:53:21,510
with at least
is

6880
01:53:21,510 --> 01:53:21,520
is
 

6881
01:53:21,520 --> 01:53:24,229
is
on the one hand that's probably the most

6882
01:53:24,229 --> 01:53:24,239
on the one hand that's probably the most
 

6883
01:53:24,239 --> 01:53:25,910
on the one hand that's probably the most
the thing that's closest to me and maybe

6884
01:53:25,910 --> 01:53:25,920
the thing that's closest to me and maybe
 

6885
01:53:25,920 --> 01:53:26,709
the thing that's closest to me and maybe
the

6886
01:53:26,709 --> 01:53:26,719
the
 

6887
01:53:26,719 --> 01:53:28,229
the
most common

6888
01:53:28,229 --> 01:53:28,239
most common
 

6889
01:53:28,239 --> 01:53:30,550
most common
human experience but

6890
01:53:30,550 --> 01:53:30,560
human experience but
 

6891
01:53:30,560 --> 01:53:31,589
human experience but
i don't know one of the things that i

6892
01:53:31,589 --> 01:53:31,599
i don't know one of the things that i
 

6893
01:53:31,599 --> 01:53:32,950
i don't know one of the things that i
just struggle with in terms of running

6894
01:53:32,950 --> 01:53:32,960
just struggle with in terms of running
 

6895
01:53:32,960 --> 01:53:34,550
just struggle with in terms of running
this large

6896
01:53:34,550 --> 01:53:34,560
this large
 

6897
01:53:34,560 --> 01:53:38,149
this large
enterprise is like

6898
01:53:38,149 --> 01:53:38,159

 

6899
01:53:38,159 --> 01:53:40,950

should the thing that i care more about

6900
01:53:40,950 --> 01:53:40,960
should the thing that i care more about
 

6901
01:53:40,960 --> 01:53:42,629
should the thing that i care more about
be

6902
01:53:42,629 --> 01:53:42,639
be
 

6903
01:53:42,639 --> 01:53:44,790
be
that responsibility

6904
01:53:44,790 --> 01:53:44,800
that responsibility
 

6905
01:53:44,800 --> 01:53:47,189
that responsibility
and

6906
01:53:47,189 --> 01:53:47,199

 

6907
01:53:47,199 --> 01:53:49,109

i think it's shifted over time

6908
01:53:49,109 --> 01:53:49,119
i think it's shifted over time
 

6909
01:53:49,119 --> 01:53:51,910
i think it's shifted over time
i mean like before i really had a family

6910
01:53:51,910 --> 01:53:51,920
i mean like before i really had a family
 

6911
01:53:51,920 --> 01:53:53,430
i mean like before i really had a family
that was like the only thing i cared

6912
01:53:53,430 --> 01:53:53,440
that was like the only thing i cared
 

6913
01:53:53,440 --> 01:53:54,790
that was like the only thing i cared
about and

6914
01:53:54,790 --> 01:53:54,800
about and
 

6915
01:53:54,800 --> 01:53:55,830
about and
i

6916
01:53:55,830 --> 01:53:55,840
i
 

6917
01:53:55,840 --> 01:53:57,910
i
at this point it's i mean i'm

6918
01:53:57,910 --> 01:53:57,920
at this point it's i mean i'm
 

6919
01:53:57,920 --> 01:54:02,629
at this point it's i mean i'm
i mean i i care deeply about it but like

6920
01:54:02,629 --> 01:54:02,639

 

6921
01:54:02,639 --> 01:54:04,790

yeah i think that that's that's not as

6922
01:54:04,790 --> 01:54:04,800
yeah i think that that's that's not as
 

6923
01:54:04,800 --> 01:54:06,790
yeah i think that that's that's not as
obvious of a question yeah we humans are

6924
01:54:06,790 --> 01:54:06,800
obvious of a question yeah we humans are
 

6925
01:54:06,800 --> 01:54:09,350
obvious of a question yeah we humans are
weird you get you get you get this

6926
01:54:09,350 --> 01:54:09,360
weird you get you get you get this
 

6927
01:54:09,360 --> 01:54:12,629
weird you get you get you get this
ability to uh impact millions of lives

6928
01:54:12,629 --> 01:54:12,639
ability to uh impact millions of lives
 

6929
01:54:12,639 --> 01:54:14,390
ability to uh impact millions of lives
and it's definitely something billions

6930
01:54:14,390 --> 01:54:14,400
and it's definitely something billions
 

6931
01:54:14,400 --> 01:54:15,510
and it's definitely something billions
of lives

6932
01:54:15,510 --> 01:54:15,520
of lives
 

6933
01:54:15,520 --> 01:54:18,310
of lives
is something you care about but the the

6934
01:54:18,310 --> 01:54:18,320
is something you care about but the the
 

6935
01:54:18,320 --> 01:54:20,870
is something you care about but the the
the weird humans that are closest to us

6936
01:54:20,870 --> 01:54:20,880
the weird humans that are closest to us
 

6937
01:54:20,880 --> 01:54:23,589
the weird humans that are closest to us
those are the ones that um mean the most

6938
01:54:23,589 --> 01:54:23,599
those are the ones that um mean the most
 

6939
01:54:23,599 --> 01:54:25,430
those are the ones that um mean the most
and i suppose that's the dream of the

6940
01:54:25,430 --> 01:54:25,440
and i suppose that's the dream of the
 

6941
01:54:25,440 --> 01:54:27,750
and i suppose that's the dream of the
metaverse is to connect

6942
01:54:27,750 --> 01:54:27,760
metaverse is to connect
 

6943
01:54:27,760 --> 01:54:29,430
metaverse is to connect
form small groups like that where you

6944
01:54:29,430 --> 01:54:29,440
form small groups like that where you
 

6945
01:54:29,440 --> 01:54:31,430
form small groups like that where you
can have those intimate relationships

6946
01:54:31,430 --> 01:54:31,440
can have those intimate relationships
 

6947
01:54:31,440 --> 01:54:33,830
can have those intimate relationships
let me ask you the big ridiculous one to

6948
01:54:33,830 --> 01:54:33,840
let me ask you the big ridiculous one to
 

6949
01:54:33,840 --> 01:54:37,109
let me ask you the big ridiculous one to
be able to be close

6950
01:54:37,109 --> 01:54:37,119
be able to be close
 

6951
01:54:37,119 --> 01:54:38,870
be able to be close
not just based on who you happen to be

6952
01:54:38,870 --> 01:54:38,880
not just based on who you happen to be
 

6953
01:54:38,880 --> 01:54:40,790
not just based on who you happen to be
next to i think that's what the internet

6954
01:54:40,790 --> 01:54:40,800
next to i think that's what the internet
 

6955
01:54:40,800 --> 01:54:43,350
next to i think that's what the internet
is already doing is allowing you to

6956
01:54:43,350 --> 01:54:43,360
is already doing is allowing you to
 

6957
01:54:43,360 --> 01:54:45,270
is already doing is allowing you to
spend more of your time not physically

6958
01:54:45,270 --> 01:54:45,280
spend more of your time not physically
 

6959
01:54:45,280 --> 01:54:46,390
spend more of your time not physically
proximate

6960
01:54:46,390 --> 01:54:46,400
proximate
 

6961
01:54:46,400 --> 01:54:47,830
proximate
i mean i always think when you think

6962
01:54:47,830 --> 01:54:47,840
i mean i always think when you think
 

6963
01:54:47,840 --> 01:54:49,270
i mean i always think when you think
about the

6964
01:54:49,270 --> 01:54:49,280
about the
 

6965
01:54:49,280 --> 01:54:50,550
about the
the metaverse people ask this question

6966
01:54:50,550 --> 01:54:50,560
the metaverse people ask this question
 

6967
01:54:50,560 --> 01:54:51,990
the metaverse people ask this question
about the real world

6968
01:54:51,990 --> 01:54:52,000
about the real world
 

6969
01:54:52,000 --> 01:54:54,070
about the real world
it's like dude the virtual world versus

6970
01:54:54,070 --> 01:54:54,080
it's like dude the virtual world versus
 

6971
01:54:54,080 --> 01:54:55,750
it's like dude the virtual world versus
the real world it's like no the real

6972
01:54:55,750 --> 01:54:55,760
the real world it's like no the real
 

6973
01:54:55,760 --> 01:54:57,189
the real world it's like no the real
world

6974
01:54:57,189 --> 01:54:57,199
world
 

6975
01:54:57,199 --> 01:54:58,870
world
is a combination of the virtual world

6976
01:54:58,870 --> 01:54:58,880
is a combination of the virtual world
 

6977
01:54:58,880 --> 01:55:00,550
is a combination of the virtual world
and the physical world but i think over

6978
01:55:00,550 --> 01:55:00,560
and the physical world but i think over
 

6979
01:55:00,560 --> 01:55:01,430
and the physical world but i think over
time

6980
01:55:01,430 --> 01:55:01,440
time
 

6981
01:55:01,440 --> 01:55:02,830
time
as we get more

6982
01:55:02,830 --> 01:55:02,840
as we get more
 

6983
01:55:02,840 --> 01:55:05,109
as we get more
technology the physical world is

6984
01:55:05,109 --> 01:55:05,119
technology the physical world is
 

6985
01:55:05,119 --> 01:55:07,109
technology the physical world is
becoming less of a percent of the real

6986
01:55:07,109 --> 01:55:07,119
becoming less of a percent of the real
 

6987
01:55:07,119 --> 01:55:08,070
becoming less of a percent of the real
world

6988
01:55:08,070 --> 01:55:08,080
world
 

6989
01:55:08,080 --> 01:55:08,870
world
and

6990
01:55:08,870 --> 01:55:08,880
and
 

6991
01:55:08,880 --> 01:55:10,229
and
i think that that opens up a lot of

6992
01:55:10,229 --> 01:55:10,239
i think that that opens up a lot of
 

6993
01:55:10,239 --> 01:55:11,589
i think that that opens up a lot of
opportunities for people because you

6994
01:55:11,589 --> 01:55:11,599
opportunities for people because you
 

6995
01:55:11,599 --> 01:55:12,950
opportunities for people because you
know you can you can work in different

6996
01:55:12,950 --> 01:55:12,960
know you can you can work in different
 

6997
01:55:12,960 --> 01:55:15,030
know you can you can work in different
places you can

6998
01:55:15,030 --> 01:55:15,040
places you can
 

6999
01:55:15,040 --> 01:55:17,350
places you can
stay more close to stay closer to people

7000
01:55:17,350 --> 01:55:17,360
stay more close to stay closer to people
 

7001
01:55:17,360 --> 01:55:18,870
stay more close to stay closer to people
who are in different places yeah that's

7002
01:55:18,870 --> 01:55:18,880
who are in different places yeah that's
 

7003
01:55:18,880 --> 01:55:21,350
who are in different places yeah that's
good removing barriers of geography and

7004
01:55:21,350 --> 01:55:21,360
good removing barriers of geography and
 

7005
01:55:21,360 --> 01:55:23,510
good removing barriers of geography and
then barriers of language yeah that's

7006
01:55:23,510 --> 01:55:23,520
then barriers of language yeah that's
 

7007
01:55:23,520 --> 01:55:25,750
then barriers of language yeah that's
that's a beautiful vision

7008
01:55:25,750 --> 01:55:25,760
that's a beautiful vision
 

7009
01:55:25,760 --> 01:55:27,830
that's a beautiful vision
big ridiculous question what do you

7010
01:55:27,830 --> 01:55:27,840
big ridiculous question what do you
 

7011
01:55:27,840 --> 01:55:43,990
big ridiculous question what do you
think is the meaning of life

7012
01:55:43,990 --> 01:55:44,000

 

7013
01:55:44,000 --> 01:55:45,430

i think that well

7014
01:55:45,430 --> 01:55:45,440
i think that well
 

7015
01:55:45,440 --> 01:55:46,790
i think that well
there are probably a couple of different

7016
01:55:46,790 --> 01:55:46,800
there are probably a couple of different
 

7017
01:55:46,800 --> 01:55:50,310
there are probably a couple of different
ways that

7018
01:55:50,310 --> 01:55:50,320

 

7019
01:55:50,320 --> 01:55:52,229

that i would go at this but i think it

7020
01:55:52,229 --> 01:55:52,239
that i would go at this but i think it
 

7021
01:55:52,239 --> 01:55:53,990
that i would go at this but i think it
gets back to this last question that we

7022
01:55:53,990 --> 01:55:54,000
gets back to this last question that we
 

7023
01:55:54,000 --> 01:55:56,390
gets back to this last question that we
talked about about the duality between

7024
01:55:56,390 --> 01:55:56,400
talked about about the duality between
 

7025
01:55:56,400 --> 01:55:57,669
talked about about the duality between
you have

7026
01:55:57,669 --> 01:55:57,679
you have
 

7027
01:55:57,679 --> 01:55:59,109
you have
the people around you who you care the

7028
01:55:59,109 --> 01:55:59,119
the people around you who you care the
 

7029
01:55:59,119 --> 01:56:01,189
the people around you who you care the
most about and then

7030
01:56:01,189 --> 01:56:01,199
most about and then
 

7031
01:56:01,199 --> 01:56:03,109
most about and then
there's like this bigger thing that

7032
01:56:03,109 --> 01:56:03,119
there's like this bigger thing that
 

7033
01:56:03,119 --> 01:56:04,550
there's like this bigger thing that
maybe you're building

7034
01:56:04,550 --> 01:56:04,560
maybe you're building
 

7035
01:56:04,560 --> 01:56:05,669
maybe you're building
um

7036
01:56:05,669 --> 01:56:05,679
um
 

7037
01:56:05,679 --> 01:56:07,350
um
and i think that in my own life i mean i

7038
01:56:07,350 --> 01:56:07,360
and i think that in my own life i mean i
 

7039
01:56:07,360 --> 01:56:09,830
and i think that in my own life i mean i
i sort of think about this tension but

7040
01:56:09,830 --> 01:56:09,840
i sort of think about this tension but
 

7041
01:56:09,840 --> 01:56:11,350
i sort of think about this tension but
it's look i mean i started this whole

7042
01:56:11,350 --> 01:56:11,360
it's look i mean i started this whole
 

7043
01:56:11,360 --> 01:56:13,990
it's look i mean i started this whole
company and my life's work is around

7044
01:56:13,990 --> 01:56:14,000
company and my life's work is around
 

7045
01:56:14,000 --> 01:56:16,070
company and my life's work is around
human connection so

7046
01:56:16,070 --> 01:56:16,080
human connection so
 

7047
01:56:16,080 --> 01:56:17,589
human connection so
um

7048
01:56:17,589 --> 01:56:17,599
um
 

7049
01:56:17,599 --> 01:56:19,910
um
i think it's intellectually

7050
01:56:19,910 --> 01:56:19,920
i think it's intellectually
 

7051
01:56:19,920 --> 01:56:21,589
i think it's intellectually
probably

7052
01:56:21,589 --> 01:56:21,599
probably
 

7053
01:56:21,599 --> 01:56:25,750
probably
the thing that i go to first is just

7054
01:56:25,750 --> 01:56:25,760

 

7055
01:56:25,760 --> 01:56:26,790

that

7056
01:56:26,790 --> 01:56:26,800
that
 

7057
01:56:26,800 --> 01:56:29,430
that
human connection is the meaning

7058
01:56:29,430 --> 01:56:29,440
human connection is the meaning
 

7059
01:56:29,440 --> 01:56:31,030
human connection is the meaning
and i mean i think that it's a thing

7060
01:56:31,030 --> 01:56:31,040
and i mean i think that it's a thing
 

7061
01:56:31,040 --> 01:56:32,550
and i mean i think that it's a thing
that our

7062
01:56:32,550 --> 01:56:32,560
that our
 

7063
01:56:32,560 --> 01:56:35,270
that our
society probably

7064
01:56:35,270 --> 01:56:35,280
society probably
 

7065
01:56:35,280 --> 01:56:37,109
society probably
systematically undervalues i mean i just

7066
01:56:37,109 --> 01:56:37,119
systematically undervalues i mean i just
 

7067
01:56:37,119 --> 01:56:39,109
systematically undervalues i mean i just
remember you know when i was growing up

7068
01:56:39,109 --> 01:56:39,119
remember you know when i was growing up
 

7069
01:56:39,119 --> 01:56:40,629
remember you know when i was growing up
and in

7070
01:56:40,629 --> 01:56:40,639
and in
 

7071
01:56:40,639 --> 01:56:43,030
and in
in school it's like do your homework and

7072
01:56:43,030 --> 01:56:43,040
in school it's like do your homework and
 

7073
01:56:43,040 --> 01:56:45,109
in school it's like do your homework and
then go play with your friends after and

7074
01:56:45,109 --> 01:56:45,119
then go play with your friends after and
 

7075
01:56:45,119 --> 01:56:46,629
then go play with your friends after and
it's like no well what if what if

7076
01:56:46,629 --> 01:56:46,639
it's like no well what if what if
 

7077
01:56:46,639 --> 01:56:49,510
it's like no well what if what if
playing with your friends is the point

7078
01:56:49,510 --> 01:56:49,520
playing with your friends is the point
 

7079
01:56:49,520 --> 01:56:51,189
playing with your friends is the point
like that sounds like an argument your

7080
01:56:51,189 --> 01:56:51,199
like that sounds like an argument your
 

7081
01:56:51,199 --> 01:56:53,270
like that sounds like an argument your
daughter should make well i mean i don't

7082
01:56:53,270 --> 01:56:53,280
daughter should make well i mean i don't
 

7083
01:56:53,280 --> 01:56:54,950
daughter should make well i mean i don't
know i just i just think it doesn't even

7084
01:56:54,950 --> 01:56:54,960
know i just i just think it doesn't even
 

7085
01:56:54,960 --> 01:56:57,270
know i just i just think it doesn't even
matter man well i think it's interesting

7086
01:56:57,270 --> 01:56:57,280
matter man well i think it's interesting
 

7087
01:56:57,280 --> 01:57:01,510
matter man well i think it's interesting
because it's you know people

7088
01:57:01,510 --> 01:57:01,520

 

7089
01:57:01,520 --> 01:57:02,950

i think people tend to think about that

7090
01:57:02,950 --> 01:57:02,960
i think people tend to think about that
 

7091
01:57:02,960 --> 01:57:05,430
i think people tend to think about that
stuff as wasting time yeah or that's

7092
01:57:05,430 --> 01:57:05,440
stuff as wasting time yeah or that's
 

7093
01:57:05,440 --> 01:57:07,030
stuff as wasting time yeah or that's
like what you do in the free time that

7094
01:57:07,030 --> 01:57:07,040
like what you do in the free time that
 

7095
01:57:07,040 --> 01:57:09,510
like what you do in the free time that
you have but like what if that's

7096
01:57:09,510 --> 01:57:09,520
you have but like what if that's
 

7097
01:57:09,520 --> 01:57:12,390
you have but like what if that's
actually the point yeah so that's one

7098
01:57:12,390 --> 01:57:12,400
actually the point yeah so that's one
 

7099
01:57:12,400 --> 01:57:13,750
actually the point yeah so that's one
but but here's here's maybe a different

7100
01:57:13,750 --> 01:57:13,760
but but here's here's maybe a different
 

7101
01:57:13,760 --> 01:57:15,669
but but here's here's maybe a different
way of counting out this which is um

7102
01:57:15,669 --> 01:57:15,679
way of counting out this which is um
 

7103
01:57:15,679 --> 01:57:17,830
way of counting out this which is um
maybe more like religious in nature i

7104
01:57:17,830 --> 01:57:17,840
maybe more like religious in nature i
 

7105
01:57:17,840 --> 01:57:22,070
maybe more like religious in nature i
mean i always like

7106
01:57:22,070 --> 01:57:22,080

 

7107
01:57:22,080 --> 01:57:23,589

there's a

7108
01:57:23,589 --> 01:57:23,599
there's a
 

7109
01:57:23,599 --> 01:57:25,830
there's a
rabbi who i've studied with who who kind

7110
01:57:25,830 --> 01:57:25,840
rabbi who i've studied with who who kind

01:57:27,760 --> 01:57:30,470
of gave me this
we were talking through genesis and the

7114
01:57:30,470 --> 01:57:30,480
we were talking through genesis and the
 

7115
01:57:30,480 --> 01:57:32,950
we were talking through genesis and the
the bible and the torah and

7116
01:57:32,950 --> 01:57:32,960
the bible and the torah and
 

7117
01:57:32,960 --> 01:57:33,340
the bible and the torah and
um

7118
01:57:33,340 --> 01:57:33,350
um
 

7119
01:57:33,350 --> 01:57:34,550
um
[Music]

7120
01:57:34,550 --> 01:57:34,560
[Music]
 

7121
01:57:34,560 --> 01:57:35,990
[Music]
and they're basically walking through

7122
01:57:35,990 --> 01:57:36,000
and they're basically walking through
 

7123
01:57:36,000 --> 01:57:37,109
and they're basically walking through
it's like

7124
01:57:37,109 --> 01:57:37,119
it's like
 

7125
01:57:37,119 --> 01:57:39,030
it's like
okay you go through the the seven days

7126
01:57:39,030 --> 01:57:39,040
okay you go through the the seven days
 

7127
01:57:39,040 --> 01:57:41,669
okay you go through the the seven days
of of creation and

7128
01:57:41,669 --> 01:57:41,679
of of creation and
 

7129
01:57:41,679 --> 01:57:43,109
of of creation and
um

7130
01:57:43,109 --> 01:57:43,119
um
 

7131
01:57:43,119 --> 01:57:44,709
um
and

7132
01:57:44,709 --> 01:57:44,719
and
 

7133
01:57:44,719 --> 01:57:46,070
and
it's basically it's like why does the

7134
01:57:46,070 --> 01:57:46,080
it's basically it's like why does the
 

7135
01:57:46,080 --> 01:57:47,830
it's basically it's like why does the
bible start there

7136
01:57:47,830 --> 01:57:47,840
bible start there
 

7137
01:57:47,840 --> 01:57:48,870
bible start there
right it's like it could have started

7138
01:57:48,870 --> 01:57:48,880
right it's like it could have started
 

7139
01:57:48,880 --> 01:57:50,310
right it's like it could have started
anywhere right in terms of like how to

7140
01:57:50,310 --> 01:57:50,320
anywhere right in terms of like how to
 

7141
01:57:50,320 --> 01:57:51,990
anywhere right in terms of like how to
live

7142
01:57:51,990 --> 01:57:52,000
live
 

7143
01:57:52,000 --> 01:57:53,189
live
but

7144
01:57:53,189 --> 01:57:53,199
but
 

7145
01:57:53,199 --> 01:57:54,470
but
basically it starts with talking about

7146
01:57:54,470 --> 01:57:54,480
basically it starts with talking about
 

7147
01:57:54,480 --> 01:57:56,709
basically it starts with talking about
how god created people

7148
01:57:56,709 --> 01:57:56,719
how god created people
 

7149
01:57:56,719 --> 01:58:00,390
how god created people
in his her image

7150
01:58:00,390 --> 01:58:00,400
in his her image
 

7151
01:58:00,400 --> 01:58:02,550
in his her image
but the bible starts by talking about

7152
01:58:02,550 --> 01:58:02,560
but the bible starts by talking about
 

7153
01:58:02,560 --> 01:58:04,629
but the bible starts by talking about
how god created everything

7154
01:58:04,629 --> 01:58:04,639
how god created everything
 

7155
01:58:04,639 --> 01:58:05,589
how god created everything
so

7156
01:58:05,589 --> 01:58:05,599
so
 

7157
01:58:05,599 --> 01:58:07,750
so
i actually think that there's like

7158
01:58:07,750 --> 01:58:07,760
i actually think that there's like
 

7159
01:58:07,760 --> 01:58:09,910
i actually think that there's like
a

7160
01:58:09,910 --> 01:58:09,920
a
 

7161
01:58:09,920 --> 01:58:11,750
a
a compelling argument that i think i've

7162
01:58:11,750 --> 01:58:11,760
a compelling argument that i think i've
 

7163
01:58:11,760 --> 01:58:13,030
a compelling argument that i think i've
always just found meaningful and

7164
01:58:13,030 --> 01:58:13,040
always just found meaningful and
 

7165
01:58:13,040 --> 01:58:15,589
always just found meaningful and
inspiring that

7166
01:58:15,589 --> 01:58:15,599
inspiring that
 

7167
01:58:15,599 --> 01:58:18,229
inspiring that
a lot of the point

7168
01:58:18,229 --> 01:58:18,239
a lot of the point
 

7169
01:58:18,239 --> 01:58:21,990
a lot of the point
of what sort of religion

7170
01:58:21,990 --> 01:58:22,000

 

7171
01:58:22,000 --> 01:58:24,550

has been telling us that we should do

7172
01:58:24,550 --> 01:58:24,560
has been telling us that we should do
 

7173
01:58:24,560 --> 01:58:27,510
has been telling us that we should do
is to create

7174
01:58:27,510 --> 01:58:27,520

 

7175
01:58:27,520 --> 01:58:29,910

and build things

7176
01:58:29,910 --> 01:58:29,920
and build things
 

7177
01:58:29,920 --> 01:58:31,510
and build things
so these things are not necessarily at

7178
01:58:31,510 --> 01:58:31,520
so these things are not necessarily at
 

7179
01:58:31,520 --> 01:58:33,350
so these things are not necessarily at
odds i mean i think like

7180
01:58:33,350 --> 01:58:33,360
odds i mean i think like
 

7181
01:58:33,360 --> 01:58:35,589
odds i mean i think like
i mean that's and i think probably to

7182
01:58:35,589 --> 01:58:35,599
i mean that's and i think probably to
 

7183
01:58:35,599 --> 01:58:36,870
i mean that's and i think probably to
some degree you'd expect me to say

7184
01:58:36,870 --> 01:58:36,880
some degree you'd expect me to say
 

7185
01:58:36,880 --> 01:58:37,990
some degree you'd expect me to say
something like this because i've

7186
01:58:37,990 --> 01:58:38,000
something like this because i've
 

7187
01:58:38,000 --> 01:58:39,589
something like this because i've
dedicated my life to creating things

7188
01:58:39,589 --> 01:58:39,599
dedicated my life to creating things
 

7189
01:58:39,599 --> 01:58:40,709
dedicated my life to creating things
that help people connect so i mean

7190
01:58:40,709 --> 01:58:40,719
that help people connect so i mean
 

7191
01:58:40,719 --> 01:58:43,510
that help people connect so i mean
that's sort of the fusion of of um

7192
01:58:43,510 --> 01:58:43,520
that's sort of the fusion of of um
 

7193
01:58:43,520 --> 01:58:44,629
that's sort of the fusion of of um
i mean getting back to what we talked

7194
01:58:44,629 --> 01:58:44,639
i mean getting back to what we talked
 

7195
01:58:44,639 --> 01:58:45,990
i mean getting back to what we talked
about earlier it's i mean what i studied

7196
01:58:45,990 --> 01:58:46,000
about earlier it's i mean what i studied
 

7197
01:58:46,000 --> 01:58:47,589
about earlier it's i mean what i studied
in school is psychology and computer

7198
01:58:47,589 --> 01:58:47,599
in school is psychology and computer
 

7199
01:58:47,599 --> 01:58:49,189
in school is psychology and computer
science right so it's i mean these are

7200
01:58:49,189 --> 01:58:49,199
science right so it's i mean these are
 

7201
01:58:49,199 --> 01:58:51,270
science right so it's i mean these are
these are like the two themes that

7202
01:58:51,270 --> 01:58:51,280
these are like the two themes that
 

7203
01:58:51,280 --> 01:58:53,430
these are like the two themes that
that i care about um
