it's a really fun time to think about

216
00:03:27,509 --> 00:03:27,519
it's a really fun time to think about
 

217
00:03:27,519 --> 00:03:28,949
it's a really fun time to think about
what were the biggest

218

what were the biggest
 

219
00:03:28,959 --> 00:03:31,270

thinking about the idea
 

261
00:04:07,280 --> 00:04:10,630
thinking about the idea
is something i'm very on fire with which

262
00:04:10,630 --> 00:04:10,640
is something i'm very on fire with which
 

263
00:04:10,640 --> 00:04:13,270
is something i'm very on fire with which
is basically ai meets physics

264
00:04:13,270 --> 00:04:13,280
is basically ai meets physics
 

265
00:04:13,280 --> 00:04:16,469
is basically ai meets physics
and you know it's been almost five years

266

00:04:23,270 --> 00:04:23,280
learning and in the beginning i noticed
 

273
00:04:23,280 --> 00:04:24,469
learning and in the beginning i noticed
a lot of my colleagues even though they

274
00:04:24,469 --> 00:04:24,479
a lot of my colleagues even though they
 

275
00:04:24,479 --> 00:04:27,510
a lot of my colleagues even though they
were polite about it well i kind of

276
00:04:27,510 --> 00:04:27,520
were polite about it well i kind of
 

277
00:04:27,520 --> 00:04:29,990
were polite about it well i kind of
what is max doing what is this weird

here also
 

305
00:04:54,320 --> 00:04:57,030
here also
and i noticed now those callings looking

306
00:04:57,030 --> 00:04:57,040
and i noticed now those callings looking
 

307
00:04:57,040 --> 00:05:00,390
and i noticed now those callings looking
at me funny have stopped asking

308
00:05:00,390 --> 00:05:00,400
at me funny have stopped asking
 

309
00:05:00,400 --> 00:05:02,150
at me funny have stopped asking
what the point is of this because it's

310
00:05:02,150 --> 00:05:02,160
what the point is of this because it's
 

311
00:05:02,160 --> 00:05:03,590
what the point is of this because it's
becoming more clear

312
00:05:03,590 --> 00:05:03,600
becoming more clear
 

313
00:05:03,600 --> 00:05:07,029
becoming more clear
and i really believe that of course ai

314
00:05:07,029 --> 00:05:07,039
and i really believe that of course ai
 

315
00:05:07,039 --> 00:05:08,469
and i really believe that of course ai
can help physics a lot

316
00:05:08,469 --> 00:05:08,479
can help physics a lot
 

317
00:05:08,479 --> 00:05:11,270
can help physics a lot
to do better physics but physics can

318
00:05:11,270 --> 00:05:11,280
to do better physics but physics can
 

319
00:05:11,280 --> 00:05:12,629
to do better physics but physics can
also help

320
00:05:12,629 --> 00:05:12,639
also help
 

321
00:05:12,639 --> 00:05:15,749
also help
ai a lot both by

322
00:05:15,749 --> 00:05:15,759
ai a lot both by
 

323
00:05:15,759 --> 00:05:18,070
ai a lot both by

very simple automated systems like

very simple automated systems like
 

527
00:08:55,279 --> 00:08:58,389
very simple automated systems like
what the boeing put into the 737 max

right yes killed a lot of people was it
 

531
00:09:00,640 --> 00:09:02,870
right yes killed a lot of people was it
that that little simple system was evil

532
00:09:02,870 --> 00:09:02,880
that that little simple system was evil
 

533
00:09:02,880 --> 00:09:03,829
that that little simple system was evil
of course not

534
00:09:03,829 --> 00:09:03,839
of course not
 

535
00:09:03,839 --> 00:09:06,150
of course not
but we didn't understand it as well as

but we didn't understand it as well as

we should have right

we should have right
 

539
00:09:07,279 --> 00:09:10,630
we should have right
and we trusted without understanding

540
00:09:10,630 --> 00:09:10,640
and we trusted without understanding
 

541
00:09:10,640 --> 00:09:13,110
and we trusted without understanding
exactly we over trust we didn't even

553
00:09:21,279 --> 00:09:23,509
i think step one if you want to be a
scientist is don't ever fool yourself

scientist is don't ever fool yourself
 

555
00:09:23,519 --> 00:09:25,030
scientist is don't ever fool yourself
into thinking you understand things when

into thinking you understand things when
 

557
00:09:25,040 --> 00:09:25,990
into thinking you understand things when
you actually don't

558

you actually don't
 

559
00:09:26,000 --> 00:09:27,990
you actually don't
yes right that's probably good advice

560
00:09:27,990 --> 00:09:28,000
yes right that's probably good advice
 

561
00:09:28,000 --> 00:09:29,350
yes right that's probably good advice
for humans in general

i think humility in general and it was

564
00:09:31,030 --> 00:09:31,040
i think humility in general and it was
 

565
00:09:31,040 --> 00:09:33,030
i think humility in general and it was
good but in science it's so spectacular

566
00:09:33,030 --> 00:09:33,040
good but in science it's so spectacular
 

567
00:09:33,040 --> 00:09:34,070
good but in science it's so spectacular
like why

568
00:09:34,070 --> 00:09:34,080
like why
 

569
00:09:34,080 --> 00:09:35,829
like why
did we have the wrong theory of gravity

570
00:09:35,829 --> 00:09:35,839
did we have the wrong theory of gravity
 

571
00:09:35,839 --> 00:09:37,590
did we have the wrong theory of gravity
ever from aristotle

onward and close until like galileo's
 

575
00:09:39,760 --> 00:09:41,509
onward and close until like galileo's
time like why would we believe something

576
00:09:41,509 --> 00:09:41,519
time like why would we believe something
 

577
00:09:41,519 --> 00:09:42,389
time like why would we believe something
so dumb

00:11:06,640 --> 00:11:08,710
um
there have been so many um even when

670
00:11:08,710 --> 00:11:08,720
there have been so many um even when
 

671
00:11:08,720 --> 00:11:09,990
there have been so many um even when
people have been killed by

672
00:11:09,990 --> 00:11:10,000
people have been killed by
 

673
00:11:10,000 --> 00:11:13,110
people have been killed by
robots it's quite rare still but in act

674
00:11:13,110 --> 00:11:13,120
robots it's quite rare still but in act
 

675
00:11:13,120 --> 00:11:15,269
robots it's quite rare still but in act
factory accidents it's in every single

676
00:11:15,269 --> 00:11:15,279
factory accidents it's in every single
 

677
00:11:15,279 --> 00:11:16,550
factory accidents it's in every single
case been not

678
00:11:16,550 --> 00:11:16,560
case been not
 

679
00:11:16,560 --> 00:11:18,389
case been not
malice just that the robot didn't

680
00:11:18,389 --> 00:11:18,399
malice just that the robot didn't
 

681
00:11:18,399 --> 00:11:20,310
malice just that the robot didn't
understand that a human is

682
00:11:20,310 --> 00:11:20,320
understand that a human is
 

683
00:11:20,320 --> 00:11:21,990
understand that a human is
different from an auto part or whatever

684
00:11:21,990 --> 00:11:22,000
different from an auto part or whatever
 

685
00:11:22,000 --> 00:11:23,509
different from an auto part or whatever
and and

686
00:11:23,509 --> 00:11:23,519
and and
 

687
00:11:23,519 --> 00:11:26,310
and and
we um so this is where i think there's

688
00:11:26,310 --> 00:11:26,320
we um so this is where i think there's
 

689
00:11:26,320 --> 00:11:27,269
we um so this is where i think there's
so so much

690
00:11:27,269 --> 00:11:27,279
so so much
 

691
00:11:27,279 --> 00:11:29,190
so so much
opportunity for physics approach where

opportunity for physics approach where
 

693
00:11:29,200 --> 00:11:30,949
opportunity for physics approach where
you just

694
00:11:30,949 --> 00:11:30,959
you just
 

695
00:11:30,959 --> 00:11:33,509
you just
aim for a higher level of understanding

696
00:11:33,509 --> 00:11:33,519
aim for a higher level of understanding
 

697
00:11:33,519 --> 00:11:34,949
aim for a higher level of understanding
and if you look at the

698
00:11:34,949 --> 00:11:34,959
and if you look at the
 

699
00:11:34,959 --> 00:11:36,949
and if you look at the
all these systems that we talked about

they're all basically black boxes
much like not so different from if you

716
00:11:54,870 --> 00:11:54,880
much like not so different from if you
 

717
00:11:54,880 --> 00:11:56,389
much like not so different from if you
teach a human something you have no idea

intelligible intelligence is my slogan

738
00:12:15,750 --> 00:12:15,760
intelligible intelligence is my slogan
 

739
00:12:15,760 --> 00:12:17,670
intelligible intelligence is my slogan
that's a good line intelligible

740
00:12:17,670 --> 00:12:17,680
that's a good line intelligible
 

741
00:12:17,680 --> 00:12:19,190
that's a good line intelligible
intelligence yeah it's not that we

742
00:12:19,190 --> 00:12:19,200
intelligence yeah it's not that we
 

743
00:12:19,200 --> 00:12:20,389
intelligence yeah it's not that we
shouldn't settle for something that

744
00:12:20,389 --> 00:12:20,399
shouldn't settle for something that
 

745
00:12:20,399 --> 00:12:21,910
shouldn't settle for something that
seems intelligent but we should it

746
00:12:21,910 --> 00:12:21,920
seems intelligent but we should it
 

747
00:12:21,920 --> 00:12:23,509
seems intelligent but we should it
should be intelligible so that we

748
00:12:23,509 --> 00:12:23,519
should be intelligible so that we
 

749
00:12:23,519 --> 00:12:25,430
should be intelligible so that we
actually trust it because we understand

750
00:12:25,430 --> 00:12:25,440
actually trust it because we understand
 

751
00:12:25,440 --> 00:12:26,629
actually trust it because we understand
it right

752
00:12:26,629 --> 00:12:26,639
it right
 

753
00:12:26,639 --> 00:12:28,790
it right
like again elon trusts his rockets

754
00:12:28,790 --> 00:12:28,800
like again elon trusts his rockets
 

755
00:12:28,800 --> 00:12:31,030
like again elon trusts his rockets
because he understands newton's laws and

756
00:12:31,030 --> 00:12:31,040
because he understands newton's laws and
 

757
00:12:31,040 --> 00:12:34,310
because he understands newton's laws and
thrust and how everything works uh and

758
00:12:34,310 --> 00:12:34,320
thrust and how everything works uh and
 

759
00:12:34,320 --> 00:12:35,509
thrust and how everything works uh and
let me tell you what can i tell you why

760
00:12:35,509 --> 00:12:35,519
let me tell you what can i tell you why
 

761
00:12:35,519 --> 00:12:37,430
let me tell you what can i tell you why
i'm optimistic about this yes

762
00:12:37,430 --> 00:12:37,440
i'm optimistic about this yes
 

763
00:12:37,440 --> 00:12:39,750
i'm optimistic about this yes
i think i think there's we've made a bit

764
00:12:39,750 --> 00:12:39,760
i think i think there's we've made a bit
 

765
00:12:39,760 --> 00:12:40,790
i think i think there's we've made a bit
of a mistake

766
00:12:40,790 --> 00:12:40,800
of a mistake
 

767
00:12:40,800 --> 00:12:43,670
of a mistake
yeah where we some people still think

768
00:12:43,670 --> 00:12:43,680
yeah where we some people still think
 

769
00:12:43,680 --> 00:12:44,870
yeah where we some people still think
that somehow we're never going to

770
00:12:44,870 --> 00:12:44,880
that somehow we're never going to
 

771
00:12:44,880 --> 00:12:47,350
that somehow we're never going to
understand neural networks

772
00:12:47,350 --> 00:12:47,360
understand neural networks
 

773
00:12:47,360 --> 00:12:48,550
understand neural networks
and we're just going to have to learn to

774
00:12:48,550 --> 00:12:48,560
and we're just going to have to learn to
 

775
00:12:48,560 --> 00:12:50,550
and we're just going to have to learn to
live with this it's this very powerful

776
00:12:50,550 --> 00:12:50,560
live with this it's this very powerful

black box
 

779
00:12:52,160 --> 00:12:54,629
black box
basically for those you know haven't

780
00:12:54,629 --> 00:12:54,639
basically for those you know haven't
 

781
00:12:54,639 --> 00:12:55,750
basically for those you know haven't
spent time

782
00:12:55,750 --> 00:12:55,760
spent time
 

783
00:12:55,760 --> 00:12:57,990
spent time
building their own it's super simple

784
00:12:57,990 --> 00:12:58,000
building their own it's super simple
 

785
00:12:58,000 --> 00:12:59,750
building their own it's super simple
what happens inside you send in a long

786
00:12:59,750 --> 00:12:59,760
what happens inside you send in a long
 

787
00:12:59,760 --> 00:13:01,190
what happens inside you send in a long
list of numbers

788
00:13:01,190 --> 00:13:01,200
list of numbers
 

789
00:13:01,200 --> 00:13:03,750
list of numbers
and then you do a bunch of operations on

790
00:13:03,750 --> 00:13:03,760
and then you do a bunch of operations on
 

791
00:13:03,760 --> 00:13:04,870
and then you do a bunch of operations on
them

792
00:13:04,870 --> 00:13:04,880
them
 

793
00:13:04,880 --> 00:13:06,790
them
multiply by matrices et cetera et cetera

794
00:13:06,790 --> 00:13:06,800
multiply by matrices et cetera et cetera
 

795
00:13:06,800 --> 00:13:08,150
multiply by matrices et cetera et cetera
and some other numbers come out that's

796
00:13:08,150 --> 00:13:08,160
and some other numbers come out that's
 

797
00:13:08,160 --> 00:13:09,750
and some other numbers come out that's
the output of it

798
00:13:09,750 --> 00:13:09,760
the output of it
 

799
00:13:09,760 --> 00:13:11,590
the output of it
and then there are a bunch of knobs you

800
00:13:11,590 --> 00:13:11,600
and then there are a bunch of knobs you
 

801
00:13:11,600 --> 00:13:13,430
and then there are a bunch of knobs you
can tune

802
00:13:13,430 --> 00:13:13,440
can tune
 

803
00:13:13,440 --> 00:13:14,710
can tune
and when you change them you know it

804
00:13:14,710 --> 00:13:14,720
and when you change them you know it
 

805
00:13:14,720 --> 00:13:16,470
and when you change them you know it
affects the computation

806
00:13:16,470 --> 00:13:16,480
affects the computation
 

807
00:13:16,480 --> 00:13:18,550
affects the computation
the input output relation and then you

808
00:13:18,550 --> 00:13:18,560
the input output relation and then you
 

809
00:13:18,560 --> 00:13:20,069
the input output relation and then you
just give the computer some definition

810
00:13:20,069 --> 00:13:20,079
just give the computer some definition
 

811
00:13:20,079 --> 00:13:20,870
just give the computer some definition
of good

812
00:13:20,870 --> 00:13:20,880
of good
 

813
00:13:20,880 --> 00:13:22,550
of good
and it keeps optimizing these knobs

814
00:13:22,550 --> 00:13:22,560
and it keeps optimizing these knobs
 

815
00:13:22,560 --> 00:13:23,910
and it keeps optimizing these knobs
until it performs as

816
00:13:23,910 --> 00:13:23,920
until it performs as
 

817
00:13:23,920 --> 00:13:25,509
until it performs as
good as possible and often you go like

818
00:13:25,509 --> 00:13:25,519
good as possible and often you go like
 

819
00:13:25,519 --> 00:13:26,949
good as possible and often you go like
wow that's really good

820
00:13:26,949 --> 00:13:26,959
wow that's really good
 

821
00:13:26,959 --> 00:13:29,430
wow that's really good
this robot can dance or this machine is

824
00:13:31,910 --> 00:13:31,920
beating me a chest now
 

825
00:13:31,920 --> 00:13:33,670
beating me a chest now
and in the end you have something which

826
00:13:33,670 --> 00:13:33,680
and in the end you have something which
 

827
00:13:33,680 --> 00:13:35,110
and in the end you have something which
even though you can look inside it you

828
00:13:35,110 --> 00:13:35,120
even though you can look inside it you
 

829
00:13:35,120 --> 00:13:35,990
even though you can look inside it you
have

830
00:13:35,990 --> 00:13:36,000
have
 

831
00:13:36,000 --> 00:13:38,389
have
very little idea of how it works you

832
00:13:38,389 --> 00:13:38,399
very little idea of how it works you
 

833
00:13:38,399 --> 00:13:39,670
very little idea of how it works you
know you can print out

834
00:13:39,670 --> 00:13:39,680
know you can print out
 

835
00:13:39,680 --> 00:13:41,990
know you can print out
tables of all the millions of parameters

836
00:13:41,990 --> 00:13:42,000
tables of all the millions of parameters
 

837
00:13:42,000 --> 00:13:43,030
tables of all the millions of parameters
in there

838
00:13:43,030 --> 00:13:43,040
in there
 

839
00:13:43,040 --> 00:13:44,710
in there
is it crystal clear now how it's working

840
00:13:44,710 --> 00:13:44,720
is it crystal clear now how it's working
 

841
00:13:44,720 --> 00:13:46,389
is it crystal clear now how it's working
you know of course not right

842
00:13:46,389 --> 00:13:46,399
you know of course not right

00:13:46,399 --> 00:13:48,069
you know of course not right
so many of my colleagues seem willing to

844
00:13:48,069 --> 00:13:48,079
so many of my colleagues seem willing to
 

845
00:13:48,079 --> 00:13:49,509
so many of my colleagues seem willing to
settle for that and i'm like

846
00:13:49,509 --> 00:13:49,519
settle for that and i'm like
 

847
00:13:49,519 --> 00:13:52,550
settle for that and i'm like
no that's like the halfway point

848
00:13:52,550 --> 00:13:52,560
no that's like the halfway point
 

849
00:13:52,560 --> 00:13:57,030
no that's like the halfway point
uh some have even gone as far as sort of

850
00:13:57,030 --> 00:13:57,040
uh some have even gone as far as sort of
 

851
00:13:57,040 --> 00:14:00,069
uh some have even gone as far as sort of
guessing that the mr the instructability

852
00:14:00,069 --> 00:14:00,079
guessing that the mr the instructability
 

853
00:14:00,079 --> 00:14:00,710
guessing that the mr the instructability
of this is

854
00:14:00,710 --> 00:14:00,720
of this is
 

855
00:14:00,720 --> 00:14:02,629
of this is
where the some of the power comes from

856
00:14:02,629 --> 00:14:02,639
where the some of the power comes from
 

857
00:14:02,639 --> 00:14:04,949
where the some of the power comes from
and sort of some sort of mysticism

858
00:14:04,949 --> 00:14:04,959
and sort of some sort of mysticism
 

859
00:14:04,959 --> 00:14:07,189
and sort of some sort of mysticism
i think that's total nonsense i i think

860
00:14:07,189 --> 00:14:07,199
i think that's total nonsense i i think
 

861
00:14:07,199 --> 00:14:09,269
i think that's total nonsense i i think
the real power of

the real power of
 

863
00:14:09,279 --> 00:14:11,189
the real power of

neural networks comes not from
 

865
00:14:11,199 --> 00:14:12,990
neural networks comes not from
inscrutability but from

00:14:12,990 --> 00:14:13,000
inscrutability but from
 

867
00:14:13,000 --> 00:14:15,750
inscrutability but from
differentiability and what i mean by

00:14:15,750 --> 00:14:15,760
differentiability and what i mean by
 

869
00:14:15,760 --> 00:14:15,990
differentiability and what i mean by
that

870
00:14:15,990 --> 00:14:16,000
that
 

871
00:14:16,000 --> 00:14:19,189
that
is simply that

872
00:14:19,189 --> 00:14:19,199
is simply that
 

873
00:14:19,199 --> 00:14:21,670
is simply that
the output depends changes only smoothly

00:14:22,240 --> 00:14:25,509
if you
tweak your knobs and then you can use

all these powerful methods we have for

that's the fundamental idea of machine

suppose you wrote this

fundamental power of

would not be a differentiable process it
 

929
00:15:10,720 --> 00:15:13,189

would make it an invalid program

would make it an invalid program
 

931
00:15:13,199 --> 00:15:14,949
would make it an invalid program
typically and then you wouldn't even

00:15:14,949 --> 00:15:14,959
typically and then you wouldn't even
 

933
00:15:14,959 --> 00:15:16,870
typically and then you wouldn't even
know if you changed more letters if it

934
00:15:16,870 --> 00:15:16,880
know if you changed more letters if it
 

935
00:15:16,880 --> 00:15:18,470

so that's the magic of uh neural

every setting of the parameters is a

00:15:26,800 --> 00:15:28,389
every setting of the parameters is a

00:15:29,440 --> 00:15:32,310
worse right and
so so you don't like the poetry of the

so so you don't like the poetry of the

or complicated equations from one of my
favorite

1002
00:16:19,509 --> 00:16:19,519
favorite
 

1003
00:16:19,519 --> 00:16:21,670
favorite
physics textbooks in fact the one that

1004
00:16:21,670 --> 00:16:21,680
physics textbooks in fact the one that
 

1005
00:16:21,680 --> 00:16:23,350
physics textbooks in fact the one that
got me into physics in the first place

1006
00:16:23,350 --> 00:16:23,360
got me into physics in the first place
 

1007
00:16:23,360 --> 00:16:27,350
got me into physics in the first place
the feynman lectures on physics and uh

1008
00:16:27,350 --> 00:16:27,360
the feynman lectures on physics and uh
 

1009
00:16:27,360 --> 00:16:28,870
the feynman lectures on physics and uh
so you have a formula you know maybe it

1010
00:16:28,870 --> 00:16:28,880
so you have a formula you know maybe it
 

1011
00:16:28,880 --> 00:16:30,389
so you have a formula you know maybe it
has

1012
00:16:30,389 --> 00:16:30,399
has
 

1013
00:16:30,399 --> 00:16:32,790
has
what goes into the formula is six

1014
00:16:32,790 --> 00:16:32,800
what goes into the formula is six
 

1015
00:16:32,800 --> 00:16:33,509
what goes into the formula is six
different

1016
00:16:33,509 --> 00:16:33,519
different
 

1017
00:16:33,519 --> 00:16:35,749
different
variables and then what comes out as one

1018
00:16:35,749 --> 00:16:35,759
variables and then what comes out as one
 

1019
00:16:35,759 --> 00:16:37,350
variables and then what comes out as one
so then you can make like a giant excel

1020
00:16:37,350 --> 00:16:37,360
so then you can make like a giant excel
 

1021
00:16:37,360 --> 00:16:39,509
so then you can make like a giant excel
spreadsheet with seven columns

1022
00:16:39,509 --> 00:16:39,519
spreadsheet with seven columns
 

1023
00:16:39,519 --> 00:16:41,030
spreadsheet with seven columns
you put in just random numbers for the

1024
00:16:41,030 --> 00:16:41,040
you put in just random numbers for the
 

1025
00:16:41,040 --> 00:16:42,470
you put in just random numbers for the
six columns for those six input

1026
00:16:42,470 --> 00:16:42,480
six columns for those six input
 

1027
00:16:42,480 --> 00:16:43,590
six columns for those six input
variables and then

1028
00:16:43,590 --> 00:16:43,600
variables and then
 

1029
00:16:43,600 --> 00:16:44,949
variables and then
you calculate with the formula the

1030
00:16:44,949 --> 00:16:44,959
you calculate with the formula the
 

1031
00:16:44,959 --> 00:16:47,189
you calculate with the formula the
seventh column the output so maybe it's

1032
00:16:47,189 --> 00:16:47,199
seventh column the output so maybe it's
 

1033
00:16:47,199 --> 00:16:47,990
seventh column the output so maybe it's
like the force

1034
00:16:47,990 --> 00:16:48,000
like the force
 

1035
00:16:48,000 --> 00:16:50,870
like the force
equals in the last column some function

1036
00:16:50,870 --> 00:16:50,880
equals in the last column some function
 

1037
00:16:50,880 --> 00:16:51,509
equals in the last column some function
of the other

1038
00:16:51,509 --> 00:16:51,519
of the other
 

1039
00:16:51,519 --> 00:16:53,590
of the other
and now the task is okay if i don't tell

1040
00:16:53,590 --> 00:16:53,600
and now the task is okay if i don't tell
 

1041
00:16:53,600 --> 00:16:56,230
and now the task is okay if i don't tell
you what the formula was

1042
00:16:56,230 --> 00:16:56,240
you what the formula was
 

1043
00:16:56,240 --> 00:16:57,670
you what the formula was
can you figure that out from looking at

1044
00:16:57,670 --> 00:16:57,680
can you figure that out from looking at
 

1045
00:16:57,680 --> 00:16:59,990
can you figure that out from looking at
my spreadsheet i gave you yes

1046
00:16:59,990 --> 00:17:00,000
my spreadsheet i gave you yes
 

1047
00:17:00,000 --> 00:17:02,829
my spreadsheet i gave you yes
this problem is called symbolic

1048
00:17:02,829 --> 00:17:02,839
this problem is called symbolic

00:17:02,839 --> 00:17:04,230
this problem is called symbolic
regression

1050
00:17:04,230 --> 00:17:04,240
regression
 

1051
00:17:04,240 --> 00:17:05,829
regression
if i tell you that the formula is what

1052
00:17:05,829 --> 00:17:05,839
if i tell you that the formula is what
 

1053
00:17:05,839 --> 00:17:07,510
if i tell you that the formula is what
we call a linear formula

1054
00:17:07,510 --> 00:17:07,520
we call a linear formula
 

1055
00:17:07,520 --> 00:17:11,990
we call a linear formula
so it's just that the output is

1056
00:17:11,990 --> 00:17:12,000

 

1057
00:17:12,000 --> 00:17:14,390

that's the famous easy problem we can
solve we do it

1064
00:17:19,189 --> 00:17:19,199
solve we do it
 

1065
00:17:19,199 --> 00:17:21,350
solve we do it

but the general one if it's more

1068
00:17:23,270 --> 00:17:23,280
but the general one if it's more
 

1069
00:17:23,280 --> 00:17:25,429
but the general one if it's more
complicated functions with logarithms or

it's a very very hard one and probably

1074
00:17:29,830 --> 00:17:29,840
it's a very very hard one and probably
 

1075
00:17:29,840 --> 00:17:31,350
it's a very very hard one and probably
impossible to do

1076
00:17:31,350 --> 00:17:31,360
impossible to do
 

1077
00:17:31,360 --> 00:17:33,750
impossible to do
fast in general just because the number

1078
00:17:33,750 --> 00:17:33,760
fast in general just because the number
 

1079
00:17:33,760 --> 00:17:35,350
fast in general just because the number
of formulas with

1080
00:17:35,350 --> 00:17:35,360
of formulas with
 

1081
00:17:35,360 --> 00:17:36,789
of formulas with
n symbols you know just grows

1082
00:17:36,789 --> 00:17:36,799
n symbols you know just grows
 

1083
00:17:36,799 --> 00:17:38,230
n symbols you know just grows
exponentially just like the number of

1084
00:17:38,230 --> 00:17:38,240
exponentially just like the number of
 

1085
00:17:38,240 --> 00:17:39,270
exponentially just like the number of
passwords you can make

1086
00:17:39,270 --> 00:17:39,280
passwords you can make

passwords you can make
grow dramatically with length so

1088
00:17:42,470 --> 00:17:42,480
grow dramatically with length so
 

1089
00:17:42,480 --> 00:17:45,750
grow dramatically with length so
so we but we had this idea that if you

1090
00:17:45,750 --> 00:17:45,760
so we but we had this idea that if you
 

1091
00:17:45,760 --> 00:17:47,430
so we but we had this idea that if you
first have a neural network that can

1092
00:17:47,430 --> 00:17:47,440
first have a neural network that can
 

1093
00:17:47,440 --> 00:17:48,950
first have a neural network that can
actually approximate the formula you

1094
00:17:48,950 --> 00:17:48,960
actually approximate the formula you
 

1095
00:17:48,960 --> 00:17:49,750
actually approximate the formula you
just trained it

1096
00:17:49,750 --> 00:17:49,760
just trained it
 

1097
00:17:49,760 --> 00:17:50,870
just trained it
even if you don't understand how it

1098
00:17:50,870 --> 00:17:50,880
even if you don't understand how it
 

1099
00:17:50,880 --> 00:17:53,510
even if you don't understand how it
works that can be

1100
00:17:53,510 --> 00:17:53,520
works that can be
 

1101
00:17:53,520 --> 00:17:55,909
works that can be
a first step towards actually

1102
00:17:55,909 --> 00:17:55,919
a first step towards actually
 

1103
00:17:55,919 --> 00:17:57,190
a first step towards actually
understanding how it works

1104
00:17:57,190 --> 00:17:57,200
understanding how it works
 

1105
00:17:57,200 --> 00:18:00,470
understanding how it works
so that's what we do first

1106
00:18:00,470 --> 00:18:00,480
so that's what we do first
 

1107
00:18:00,480 --> 00:18:02,630
so that's what we do first
and then we study that neural network

1108
00:18:02,630 --> 00:18:02,640
and then we study that neural network
 

1109
00:18:02,640 --> 00:18:03,590
and then we study that neural network
now and

1110
00:18:03,590 --> 00:18:03,600
now and
 

1111
00:18:03,600 --> 00:18:04,870
now and
put in all sorts of other data that

1112
00:18:04,870 --> 00:18:04,880
put in all sorts of other data that
 

1113
00:18:04,880 --> 00:18:07,270
put in all sorts of other data that
wasn't in the original training data and

1114
00:18:07,270 --> 00:18:07,280
wasn't in the original training data and
 

1115
00:18:07,280 --> 00:18:09,350
wasn't in the original training data and
use that to discover simplifying

1116
00:18:09,350 --> 00:18:09,360
use that to discover simplifying
 

1117
00:18:09,360 --> 00:18:11,270
use that to discover simplifying
properties of the formula

1118
00:18:11,270 --> 00:18:11,280
properties of the formula
 

1119
00:18:11,280 --> 00:18:13,029
properties of the formula
and that lets us break it apart often

1120
00:18:13,029 --> 00:18:13,039
and that lets us break it apart often
 

1121
00:18:13,039 --> 00:18:14,630
and that lets us break it apart often
into many simpler pieces

1122
00:18:14,630 --> 00:18:14,640
into many simpler pieces
 

1123
00:18:14,640 --> 00:18:15,990
into many simpler pieces
and a kind of divide and conquer

1124
00:18:15,990 --> 00:18:16,000
and a kind of divide and conquer
 

1125
00:18:16,000 --> 00:18:18,150
and a kind of divide and conquer
approach that we so we were able to

1126
00:18:18,150 --> 00:18:18,160
approach that we so we were able to
 

1127
00:18:18,160 --> 00:18:20,390
approach that we so we were able to
solve all of those 100 formulas discover

1128
00:18:20,390 --> 00:18:20,400
solve all of those 100 formulas discover

at different wavelengths from a hot
 

1165
00:18:53,600 --> 00:18:55,430
at different wavelengths from a hot
object and discovered the famous

1166
00:18:55,430 --> 00:18:55,440
object and discovered the famous
 

1167
00:18:55,440 --> 00:18:57,990
object and discovered the famous
blackbody formula this discovers it

1168
00:18:57,990 --> 00:18:58,000
blackbody formula this discovers it
 

1169
00:18:58,000 --> 00:19:00,230

automatically
 

1171
00:19:00,240 --> 00:19:04,710
automatically
i'm actually excited about

1172
00:19:04,710 --> 00:19:04,720

 

1173
00:19:04,720 --> 00:19:06,470

seeing if we can discover not just old

00:19:06,470 --> 00:19:06,480
seeing if we can discover not just old
 

1175
00:19:06,480 --> 00:19:08,549
seeing if we can discover not just old
formulas again

1176
00:19:08,549 --> 00:19:08,559
formulas again
 

1177
00:19:08,559 --> 00:19:10,870
formulas again
but new formulas that no one has seen

chipmunks and bluejays and we experience
things in the world

1328
00:21:41,669 --> 00:21:41,679
things in the world
 

1329
00:21:41,679 --> 00:21:43,430
things in the world
but then we humans do this additional

1330
00:21:43,430 --> 00:21:43,440
but then we humans do this additional
 

1331
00:21:43,440 --> 00:21:45,110
but then we humans do this additional
step on top of that where we then

1332
00:21:45,110 --> 00:21:45,120
step on top of that where we then
 

1333
00:21:45,120 --> 00:21:48,149
step on top of that where we then
distill out certain high-level

1334
00:21:48,149 --> 00:21:48,159
distill out certain high-level
 

1335
00:21:48,159 --> 00:21:50,230
distill out certain high-level
knowledge that we've extracted from this

1336
00:21:50,230 --> 00:21:50,240
knowledge that we've extracted from this
 

1337
00:21:50,240 --> 00:21:52,230
knowledge that we've extracted from this
in a way that we can communicate it

1338
00:21:52,230 --> 00:21:52,240
in a way that we can communicate it
 

1339
00:21:52,240 --> 00:21:54,390
in a way that we can communicate it
to each other in a symbolic form in

1340
00:21:54,390 --> 00:21:54,400
to each other in a symbolic form in
 

1341
00:21:54,400 --> 00:21:55,270
to each other in a symbolic form in
english

1342
00:21:55,270 --> 00:21:55,280
english
 

1343
00:21:55,280 --> 00:21:59,110
english
in this case right so if we can do it

1344
00:21:59,110 --> 00:21:59,120
in this case right so if we can do it
 

1345
00:21:59,120 --> 00:22:01,270
in this case right so if we can do it
and we believe that we are information

1346
00:22:01,270 --> 00:22:01,280
and we believe that we are information
 

1347
00:22:01,280 --> 00:22:02,950
and we believe that we are information
processing entities

1348
00:22:02,950 --> 00:22:02,960
processing entities
 

1349
00:22:02,960 --> 00:22:04,470
processing entities
then we should be able to make machine

1350
00:22:04,470 --> 00:22:04,480
then we should be able to make machine
 

1351
00:22:04,480 --> 00:22:07,029
then we should be able to make machine
learning that does it also

1352
00:22:07,029 --> 00:22:07,039
learning that does it also
 

1353
00:22:07,039 --> 00:22:08,950
learning that does it also
well do you think the entire thing could

1354
00:22:08,950 --> 00:22:08,960
well do you think the entire thing could
 

1355
00:22:08,960 --> 00:22:10,149
well do you think the entire thing could
be learning

1356
00:22:10,149 --> 00:22:10,159
be learning
 

1357
00:22:10,159 --> 00:22:12,149
be learning
because they're uh this dissection

1358
00:22:12,149 --> 00:22:12,159
because they're uh this dissection
 

1359
00:22:12,159 --> 00:22:14,070
because they're uh this dissection
process like for ai feynman

1363
00:22:17,120 --> 00:22:17,430
the secondary stage feels like something
like

reasoning and the initial step feels
 

1367
00:22:20,480 --> 00:22:22,070
reasoning and the initial step feels
like more like the

1368
00:22:22,070 --> 00:22:22,080
like more like the
 

1369
00:22:22,080 --> 00:22:24,549

1373
00:22:25,120 --> 00:22:26,950

do you think the whole thing could be

1374
00:22:26,950 --> 00:22:26,960
do you think the whole thing could be
 

1375
00:22:26,960 --> 00:22:28,870

00:22:30,400 --> 00:22:32,070
do you think the whole thing could be
basically neural networks on top of each

1380
00:22:32,070 --> 00:22:32,080
basically neural networks on top of each
 

1381
00:22:32,080 --> 00:22:33,669
basically neural networks on top of each
other it's like turtles all the way down

1382
00:22:33,669 --> 00:22:33,679
other it's like turtles all the way down
 

1383
00:22:33,679 --> 00:22:34,950
other it's like turtles all the way down
could be neural networks all the way

1384
00:22:34,950 --> 00:22:34,960
could be neural networks all the way
 

1385
00:22:34,960 --> 00:22:37,430
could be neural networks all the way
down i mean that's a really interesting

1386
00:22:37,430 --> 00:22:37,440
down i mean that's a really interesting
 

1387
00:22:37,440 --> 00:22:38,710
down i mean that's a really interesting
question we know that in

1388
00:22:38,710 --> 00:22:38,720
question we know that in
 

1389
00:22:38,720 --> 00:22:40,470
question we know that in
in your case it is neural networks all

1390
00:22:40,470 --> 00:22:40,480
in your case it is neural networks all
 

1391
00:22:40,480 --> 00:22:41,990
in your case it is neural networks all
the way down because

1392
00:22:41,990 --> 00:22:42,000
the way down because
 

1393
00:22:42,000 --> 00:22:43,270
the way down because
you have in your skull as a bunch of

1394
00:22:43,270 --> 00:22:43,280
you have in your skull as a bunch of
 

1395
00:22:43,280 --> 00:22:45,510
you have in your skull as a bunch of
neurons doing their thing right

1396
00:22:45,510 --> 00:22:45,520
neurons doing their thing right
 

1397
00:22:45,520 --> 00:22:49,190
neurons doing their thing right
yeah but uh if you ask the question

1398
00:22:49,190 --> 00:22:49,200
yeah but uh if you ask the question
 

1399
00:22:49,200 --> 00:22:51,350
yeah but uh if you ask the question
more generally what what algorithms are

1400
00:22:51,350 --> 00:22:51,360
more generally what what algorithms are

00:22:56,070 --> 00:22:56,080
think super interesting to compare
 

1407
00:22:56,080 --> 00:22:57,510

i think we've gone a little bit

1408
00:22:57,510 --> 00:22:57,520
i think we've gone a little bit
 

1409
00:22:57,520 --> 00:22:59,110
i think we've gone a little bit
backwards historically because

1410
00:22:59,110 --> 00:22:59,120
backwards historically because
 

1411
00:22:59,120 --> 00:23:02,070
backwards historically because
we humans first discovered good

1412
00:23:02,070 --> 00:23:02,080
we humans first discovered good
 

1413
00:23:02,080 --> 00:23:04,310
we humans first discovered good
old-fashioned ai the logic based ai that

1414
00:23:04,310 --> 00:23:04,320
old-fashioned ai the logic based ai that
 

1415
00:23:04,320 --> 00:23:05,669
old-fashioned ai the logic based ai that
we often called

1416
00:23:05,669 --> 00:23:05,679
we often called
 

1417
00:23:05,679 --> 00:23:09,029
we often called
gophi for good old-fashioned ai

1418
00:23:09,029 --> 00:23:09,039
gophi for good old-fashioned ai
 

1419
00:23:09,039 --> 00:23:11,990
gophi for good old-fashioned ai
and then more recently we did machine

1420
00:23:11,990 --> 00:23:12,000
and then more recently we did machine
 

1421
00:23:12,000 --> 00:23:12,630
and then more recently we did machine
learning

1422
00:23:12,630 --> 00:23:12,640
learning
 

1423
00:23:12,640 --> 00:23:14,149
learning
because it required bigger computers so

1424
00:23:14,149 --> 00:23:14,159
because it required bigger computers so
 

1425
00:23:14,159 --> 00:23:15,830
because it required bigger computers so
we had to discover it later

1426
00:23:15,830 --> 00:23:15,840
we had to discover it later
 

1427
00:23:15,840 --> 00:23:17,350
we had to discover it later
so we think of machine learning with

1428
00:23:17,350 --> 00:23:17,360
so we think of machine learning with
 

1429
00:23:17,360 --> 00:23:19,190
so we think of machine learning with
neural networks

1430

but if you look at evolution on earth

1436
00:23:27,430 --> 00:23:27,440
but if you look at evolution on earth
 

1437
00:23:27,440 --> 00:23:28,789
but if you look at evolution on earth
right it's actually been the other way

1438
00:23:28,789 --> 00:23:28,799
right it's actually been the other way
 

1439
00:23:28,799 --> 00:23:29,750
right it's actually been the other way

right so basically what happened was

1480
00:24:13,510 --> 00:24:13,520
right so basically what happened was
 

1481
00:24:13,520 --> 00:24:14,950
right so basically what happened was
first we built these computers that

1482
00:24:14,950 --> 00:24:14,960
first we built these computers that
 

1483
00:24:14,960 --> 00:24:15,430
first we built these computers that
could

1484
00:24:15,430 --> 00:24:15,440
could
 

1485
00:24:15,440 --> 00:24:16,870
could
multiply numbers real fast and

1486
00:24:16,870 --> 00:24:16,880
multiply numbers real fast and
 

1487
00:24:16,880 --> 00:24:18,710
multiply numbers real fast and
manipulate symbols and we felt they were

1488
00:24:18,710 --> 00:24:18,720
manipulate symbols and we felt they were
 

1489
00:24:18,720 --> 00:24:20,549
manipulate symbols and we felt they were

pretty dumb
and that then we made neural networks

1492
00:24:22,630 --> 00:24:22,640
and that then we made neural networks
 

1493
00:24:22,640 --> 00:24:24,950
and that then we made neural networks
that can see as well as a cat can

we do it in our brains and there seems
to be basically two strategies i see in

the one that scares the heebie-jeebies
out of me is this attitude that we're

00:25:12,549 --> 00:25:12,559
out of me is this attitude that we're
 

1547
00:25:12,559 --> 00:25:14,310
out of me is this attitude that we're
just gonna make ever bigger systems that

1548
00:25:14,310 --> 00:25:14,320
just gonna make ever bigger systems that
 

1549
00:25:14,320 --> 00:25:15,830
just gonna make ever bigger systems that
we still don't understand

what could possibly go wrong right yeah

1556
00:25:22,230 --> 00:25:22,240
what could possibly go wrong right yeah
 

1557
00:25:22,240 --> 00:25:23,909
what could possibly go wrong right yeah
i think it's just such a reckless thing

1558
00:25:23,909 --> 00:25:23,919
i think it's just such a reckless thing
 

1559
00:25:23,919 --> 00:25:25,990
i think it's just such a reckless thing
to do and unfortunately

00:26:32,870 --> 00:26:32,880
yes now imagine that that person has
 

1627
00:26:32,880 --> 00:26:35,269
yes now imagine that that person has

00:26:37,269 --> 00:26:37,279
under their control and can use it to
 

1631
00:26:37,279 --> 00:26:38,630
under their control and can use it to
impose their will on the whole planet

1632
00:26:38,630 --> 00:26:38,640
impose their will on the whole planet
 

1633
00:26:38,640 --> 00:26:42,950
impose their will on the whole planet
how does that make you feel

1634
00:26:42,950 --> 00:26:42,960

 

1635
00:26:42,960 --> 00:26:47,029

yeah so the can can we break that apart

1636
00:26:47,029 --> 00:26:47,039
yeah so the can can we break that apart
 

1637
00:26:47,039 --> 00:26:47,750
yeah so the can can we break that apart
just

1638
00:26:47,750 --> 00:26:47,760
just
 

1639
00:26:47,760 --> 00:26:50,789

chance that we'll run into trouble with

1642
00:26:52,390 --> 00:26:52,400
chance that we'll run into trouble with
 

1643
00:26:52,400 --> 00:26:54,470
chance that we'll run into trouble with
this approach do you see

1644
00:26:54,470 --> 00:26:54,480
this approach do you see
 

1645
00:26:54,480 --> 00:26:57,430
this approach do you see
the bigger worry in that leader or

1646
00:26:57,430 --> 00:26:57,440
the bigger worry in that leader or
 

1647
00:26:57,440 --> 00:26:58,149
the bigger worry in that leader or

using the system to do damage or
are you more worried and i think i'm

1652
00:27:04,470 --> 00:27:04,480
are you more worried and i think i'm
 

1653
00:27:04,480 --> 00:27:06,710
are you more worried and i think i'm
in this camp more worried about like

1654
00:27:06,710 --> 00:27:06,720
in this camp more worried about like
 

1655
00:27:06,720 --> 00:27:07,510
in this camp more worried about like
accidental

1656
00:27:07,510 --> 00:27:07,520
accidental
 

1657
00:27:07,520 --> 00:27:10,789
accidental
unintentional destruction of everything

1658
00:27:10,789 --> 00:27:10,799
unintentional destruction of everything
 

1659
00:27:10,799 --> 00:27:13,110
unintentional destruction of everything
so like humans trying to do good and

1660
00:27:13,110 --> 00:27:13,120
so like humans trying to do good and
 

1661
00:27:13,120 --> 00:27:14,470
so like humans trying to do good and
like

1662
00:27:14,470 --> 00:27:14,480
like
 

1663
00:27:14,480 --> 00:27:16,470
like
in a way where everyone agrees it's kind

1664
00:27:16,470 --> 00:27:16,480
in a way where everyone agrees it's kind
 

1665
00:27:16,480 --> 00:27:18,630
in a way where everyone agrees it's kind
of good it's just they're trying to do

1666
00:27:18,630 --> 00:27:18,640
of good it's just they're trying to do
 

1667
00:27:18,640 --> 00:27:19,990
of good it's just they're trying to do
good without understanding

1668
00:27:19,990 --> 00:27:20,000
good without understanding
 

1669
00:27:20,000 --> 00:27:21,590
good without understanding
because i think every evil leader in

1670
00:27:21,590 --> 00:27:21,600
because i think every evil leader in
 

1671
00:27:21,600 --> 00:27:23,669
because i think every evil leader in
history thought they're

1672
00:27:23,669 --> 00:27:23,679
history thought they're
 

1673
00:27:23,679 --> 00:27:25,110
history thought they're
to some degree thought they were trying

1674
00:27:25,110 --> 00:27:25,120
to some degree thought they were trying
 

1675
00:27:25,120 --> 00:27:26,470
to some degree thought they were trying
to do good oh yeah i'm sure hitler

1676
00:27:26,470 --> 00:27:26,480
to do good oh yeah i'm sure hitler
 

1677
00:27:26,480 --> 00:27:27,830
to do good oh yeah i'm sure hitler
thought he was doing

1678
00:27:27,830 --> 00:27:27,840
thought he was doing
 

1679
00:27:27,840 --> 00:27:29,990
thought he was doing
good yeah they're good too i've been

1680
00:27:29,990 --> 00:27:30,000
good yeah they're good too i've been
 

1681
00:27:30,000 --> 00:27:31,510
good yeah they're good too i've been
reading a lot about stalin i'm sure

1682
00:27:31,510 --> 00:27:31,520
reading a lot about stalin i'm sure
 

1683
00:27:31,520 --> 00:27:32,630
reading a lot about stalin i'm sure
stalin

1684
00:27:32,630 --> 00:27:32,640
stalin
 

1685
00:27:32,640 --> 00:27:35,110
stalin
is from he legitimately thought that

1686
00:27:35,110 --> 00:27:35,120
is from he legitimately thought that
 

1687
00:27:35,120 --> 00:27:36,630
is from he legitimately thought that
communism was good for the world and

1688
00:27:36,630 --> 00:27:36,640
communism was good for the world and
 

1689
00:27:36,640 --> 00:27:37,750
communism was good for the world and
that he was doing good

1690
00:27:37,750 --> 00:27:37,760
that he was doing good
 

1691
00:27:37,760 --> 00:27:39,350
that he was doing good
i think mao zedong thought what he was

1692
00:27:39,350 --> 00:27:39,360
i think mao zedong thought what he was
 

1693
00:27:39,360 --> 00:27:40,710
i think mao zedong thought what he was
doing with a great leap forward is good

1694
00:27:40,710 --> 00:27:40,720
doing with a great leap forward is good
 

1695
00:27:40,720 --> 00:27:41,269
doing with a great leap forward is good
too

1696
00:27:41,269 --> 00:27:41,279
too
 

1697
00:27:41,279 --> 00:27:44,470
too
yeah i'm actually concerned about both

1698
00:27:44,470 --> 00:27:44,480
yeah i'm actually concerned about both
 

1699
00:27:44,480 --> 00:27:45,190
yeah i'm actually concerned about both
of those

1700
00:27:45,190 --> 00:27:45,200
of those
 

1701
00:27:45,200 --> 00:27:47,990
of those
uh before i promised to answer this in

1702
00:27:47,990 --> 00:27:48,000
uh before i promised to answer this in
 

1703
00:27:48,000 --> 00:27:49,590
uh before i promised to answer this in
detail but before we do that

1704
00:27:49,590 --> 00:27:49,600
detail but before we do that
 

1705
00:27:49,600 --> 00:27:50,870
detail but before we do that
let me finish answering the first

1706
00:27:50,870 --> 00:27:50,880
let me finish answering the first
 

1707
00:27:50,880 --> 00:27:52,070
let me finish answering the first
question because i told you that there

1708
00:27:52,070 --> 00:27:52,080
question because i told you that there
 

1709
00:27:52,080 --> 00:27:52,630
question because i told you that there
were two

1710
00:27:52,630 --> 00:27:52,640
were two
 

1711
00:27:52,640 --> 00:27:53,909
were two
different boosts we could get to

1712
00:27:53,909 --> 00:27:53,919
different boosts we could get to
 

1713
00:27:53,919 --> 00:27:55,269
different boosts we could get to
artificial general intelligence and one

1714
00:27:55,269 --> 00:27:55,279
artificial general intelligence and one
 

1715
00:27:55,279 --> 00:27:57,110
artificial general intelligence and one
scares the species out of me

1716
00:27:57,110 --> 00:27:57,120
scares the species out of me
 

1717
00:27:57,120 --> 00:27:58,389
scares the species out of me
which is this one where we build

1718
00:27:58,389 --> 00:27:58,399
which is this one where we build
 

1719
00:27:58,399 --> 00:28:00,470
which is this one where we build
something we just say bigger neural

1720
00:28:00,470 --> 00:28:00,480
something we just say bigger neural
 

1721
00:28:00,480 --> 00:28:02,389
something we just say bigger neural
networks ever more hardware and just

1722
00:28:02,389 --> 00:28:02,399
networks ever more hardware and just
 

1723
00:28:02,399 --> 00:28:04,310
networks ever more hardware and just
train the heck out and more data and

1724
00:28:04,310 --> 00:28:04,320
train the heck out and more data and
 

1725
00:28:04,320 --> 00:28:08,710
train the heck out and more data and
poof now it's very powerful that i think

1726
00:28:08,710 --> 00:28:08,720
poof now it's very powerful that i think
 

1727
00:28:08,720 --> 00:28:10,950
poof now it's very powerful that i think
is the the most unsafe and reckless

1728
00:28:10,950 --> 00:28:10,960
is the the most unsafe and reckless
 

1729
00:28:10,960 --> 00:28:11,750
is the the most unsafe and reckless
approach

1730
00:28:11,750 --> 00:28:11,760
approach
 

1731
00:28:11,760 --> 00:28:14,230
approach
the alternative to that is the

1732
00:28:14,230 --> 00:28:14,240
the alternative to that is the
 

1733
00:28:14,240 --> 00:28:15,190
the alternative to that is the
intelligent

1735
00:28:15,200 --> 00:28:16,789

intelligible intelligence approach

1736
00:28:16,789 --> 00:28:16,799
intelligible intelligence approach
 

1737
00:28:16,799 --> 00:28:18,870
intelligible intelligence approach
instead where

instead where
 

1739
00:28:18,880 --> 00:28:23,590
instead where
we uh say neural networks is just a tool

00:28:23,590 --> 00:28:23,600
we uh say neural networks is just a tool
 

1741
00:28:23,600 --> 00:28:25,590
we uh say neural networks is just a tool
to this like for the first step to get

1742
00:28:25,590 --> 00:28:25,600
to this like for the first step to get
 

1743
00:28:25,600 --> 00:28:26,870
to this like for the first step to get
the intuition

1744
00:28:26,870 --> 00:28:26,880
the intuition
 

1745
00:28:26,880 --> 00:28:29,029
the intuition
but then we're going to spend also

1746
00:28:29,029 --> 00:28:29,039
but then we're going to spend also
 

1747
00:28:29,039 --> 00:28:30,230
but then we're going to spend also
serious resources

1748
00:28:30,230 --> 00:28:30,240
serious resources
 

1749
00:28:30,240 --> 00:28:33,669
serious resources

00:28:35,679 --> 00:28:37,510
demystifying this black box and figuring
out what's it actually doing

1754
00:28:37,510 --> 00:28:37,520
out what's it actually doing
 

1755
00:28:37,520 --> 00:28:39,669
out what's it actually doing
so we can convert it into something

1756
00:28:39,669 --> 00:28:39,679
so we can convert it into something
 

1757
00:28:39,679 --> 00:28:41,350
so we can convert it into something
that's equally intelligent but that we

1758
00:28:41,350 --> 00:28:41,360
that's equally intelligent but that we
 

1759
00:28:41,360 --> 00:28:42,870
that's equally intelligent but that we
actually understand

1760
00:28:42,870 --> 00:28:42,880
actually understand
 

1761
00:28:42,880 --> 00:28:44,950
actually understand
what it's doing maybe we can even prove

1762
00:28:44,950 --> 00:28:44,960
what it's doing maybe we can even prove
 

1763
00:28:44,960 --> 00:28:46,230
what it's doing maybe we can even prove
theorems about it that

1764
00:28:46,230 --> 00:28:46,240
theorems about it that

this car here will never be hacked

1766
00:28:49,430 --> 00:28:49,440
this car here will never be hacked
 

1767
00:28:49,440 --> 00:28:50,870
this car here will never be hacked
when it's driving because here's the

1768
00:28:50,870 --> 00:28:50,880
when it's driving because here's the
 

1769
00:28:50,880 --> 00:28:53,669
when it's driving because here's the
proof uh

1770
00:28:53,669 --> 00:28:53,679
proof uh
 

1771
00:28:53,679 --> 00:28:55,350
proof uh
there is a whole science of this it

1772
00:28:55,350 --> 00:28:55,360
there is a whole science of this it
 

1773
00:28:55,360 --> 00:28:56,870
there is a whole science of this it
doesn't work for neural networks

1774
00:28:56,870 --> 00:28:56,880
doesn't work for neural networks
 

1775
00:28:56,880 --> 00:28:58,470
doesn't work for neural networks
there are big black boxes but it works

1776
00:28:58,470 --> 00:28:58,480
there are big black boxes but it works
 

1777
00:28:58,480 --> 00:29:00,389
there are big black boxes but it works
well and we're certain other kinds of

1778
00:29:00,389 --> 00:29:00,399
well and we're certain other kinds of
 

1779
00:29:00,399 --> 00:29:02,950
well and we're certain other kinds of
codes right

1780
00:29:02,950 --> 00:29:02,960
codes right
 

1781
00:29:02,960 --> 00:29:04,710
codes right
that approach i think is much more

1782
00:29:04,710 --> 00:29:04,720
that approach i think is much more
 

1783
00:29:04,720 --> 00:29:06,230
that approach i think is much more
promising that's exactly why i'm working

1784
00:29:06,230 --> 00:29:06,240
promising that's exactly why i'm working
 

1785
00:29:06,240 --> 00:29:08,070
promising that's exactly why i'm working
on it frankly not just because i think

1786
00:29:08,070 --> 00:29:08,080
on it frankly not just because i think
 

1787
00:29:08,080 --> 00:29:09,350
on it frankly not just because i think
it's cool for science

1788
00:29:09,350 --> 00:29:09,360
it's cool for science
 

1789
00:29:09,360 --> 00:29:11,669
it's cool for science
but because i think the more we

1790
00:29:11,669 --> 00:29:11,679
but because i think the more we
 

1791
00:29:11,679 --> 00:29:12,710
but because i think the more we
understand

1792
00:29:12,710 --> 00:29:12,720
understand
 

1793
00:29:12,720 --> 00:29:14,789
understand
i mean these systems the better the

1794
00:29:14,789 --> 00:29:14,799
i mean these systems the better the
 

1795
00:29:14,799 --> 00:29:15,750
i mean these systems the better the
chance is that

1796
00:29:15,750 --> 00:29:15,760
chance is that
 

1797
00:29:15,760 --> 00:29:17,669
chance is that
we can make them do the things that are

1798
00:29:17,669 --> 00:29:17,679
we can make them do the things that are
 

1799
00:29:17,679 --> 00:29:19,669
we can make them do the things that are
good for us that are actually intended

1800
00:29:19,669 --> 00:29:19,679
good for us that are actually intended
 

1801
00:29:19,679 --> 00:29:22,230
good for us that are actually intended
not unintended so do you think it's

1802
00:29:22,230 --> 00:29:22,240
not unintended so do you think it's
 

1803
00:29:22,240 --> 00:29:23,909
not unintended so do you think it's
possible to prove

1804
00:29:23,909 --> 00:29:23,919
possible to prove
 

1805
00:29:23,919 --> 00:29:26,149
possible to prove
things about something as complicated as

1806
00:29:26,149 --> 00:29:26,159
things about something as complicated as
 

1807
00:29:26,159 --> 00:29:27,269
things about something as complicated as
a neural network

1808
00:29:27,269 --> 00:29:27,279
a neural network
 

1809
00:29:27,279 --> 00:29:30,389
a neural network
that's the hope well ideally there's no

1810
00:29:30,389 --> 00:29:30,399
that's the hope well ideally there's no
 

1811
00:29:30,399 --> 00:29:32,230
that's the hope well ideally there's no
reason there has to be a neural network

1812
00:29:32,230 --> 00:29:32,240
reason there has to be a neural network

00:29:32,240 --> 00:29:32,870
reason there has to be a neural network
in the end

1814
00:29:32,870 --> 00:29:32,880
in the end
 

1815
00:29:32,880 --> 00:29:35,510
in the end
either right like we discovered newton's

1816
00:29:35,510 --> 00:29:35,520
either right like we discovered newton's
 

1817
00:29:35,520 --> 00:29:36,549
either right like we discovered newton's
laws of gravity

1818
00:29:36,549 --> 00:29:36,559
laws of gravity
 

1819
00:29:36,559 --> 00:29:39,590

00:29:39,590 --> 00:29:39,600
with neural network in newton's head
 

1821
00:29:39,600 --> 00:29:40,950
with neural network in newton's head
yes but that's not the way it's

1822
00:29:40,950 --> 00:29:40,960
yes but that's not the way it's
 

1823
00:29:40,960 --> 00:29:43,350
yes but that's not the way it's
programmed into the

1824
00:29:43,350 --> 00:29:43,360
programmed into the
 

1825
00:29:43,360 --> 00:29:45,669

1827
00:29:45,679 --> 00:29:47,110
navigation system of elon musk's rocket
anymore right it's written

1828
00:29:47,110 --> 00:29:47,120
anymore right it's written
 

1829
00:29:47,120 --> 00:29:49,269
anymore right it's written
in c plus plus or i don't know what

1833
00:29:51,039 --> 00:29:52,549

yeah and then there are software tools

1834
00:29:52,549 --> 00:29:52,559
yeah and then there are software tools
 

1835
00:29:52,559 --> 00:29:54,389
yeah and then there are software tools
called symbolic verification

1836
00:29:54,389 --> 00:29:54,399
called symbolic verification

the darpa and the us military has done a

1838
00:29:58,230 --> 00:29:58,240
the darpa and the us military has done a
 

1839
00:29:58,240 --> 00:30:00,389
the darpa and the us military has done a
lot of really great research on this

1840
00:30:00,389 --> 00:30:00,399
lot of really great research on this
 

1841
00:30:00,399 --> 00:30:01,750
lot of really great research on this
because they really want to understand

1842
00:30:01,750 --> 00:30:01,760
because they really want to understand
 

1843
00:30:01,760 --> 00:30:03,750
because they really want to understand
that when they build weapon systems they

1844
00:30:03,750 --> 00:30:03,760
that when they build weapon systems they
 

1845
00:30:03,760 --> 00:30:04,710
that when they build weapon systems they
don't just

1846
00:30:04,710 --> 00:30:04,720
don't just
 

1847
00:30:04,720 --> 00:30:07,430
don't just
go fire at random or malfunction right

1848
00:30:07,430 --> 00:30:07,440
go fire at random or malfunction right
 

1849
00:30:07,440 --> 00:30:08,870
go fire at random or malfunction right
and

1850
00:30:08,870 --> 00:30:08,880
and
 

1851
00:30:08,880 --> 00:30:10,630
and
there's even a whole operating system

1852
00:30:10,630 --> 00:30:10,640
there's even a whole operating system
 

1853
00:30:10,640 --> 00:30:12,230
there's even a whole operating system
called cell 3 that's been developed by a

you can actually mathematically prove

1858
00:30:15,990 --> 00:30:16,000
you can actually mathematically prove
 

1859
00:30:16,000 --> 00:30:18,789
you can actually mathematically prove
that this thing can never be hacked

1860
00:30:18,789 --> 00:30:18,799
that this thing can never be hacked
 

1861
00:30:18,799 --> 00:30:21,830
that this thing can never be hacked
well one day i hope that will be

1862
00:30:21,830 --> 00:30:21,840
well one day i hope that will be
 

1863
00:30:21,840 --> 00:30:23,269
well one day i hope that will be
something you can say about the os

1864
00:30:23,269 --> 00:30:23,279
something you can say about the os
 

1865
00:30:23,279 --> 00:30:25,029
something you can say about the os
that's running on our laptops too

1866
00:30:25,029 --> 00:30:25,039
that's running on our laptops too
 

1867
00:30:25,039 --> 00:30:27,590
that's running on our laptops too
as you know we're not there but i think

1868
00:30:27,590 --> 00:30:27,600
as you know we're not there but i think
 

1869
00:30:27,600 --> 00:30:28,950
as you know we're not there but i think
we should be ambitious

1870
00:30:28,950 --> 00:30:28,960
we should be ambitious
 

1871
00:30:28,960 --> 00:30:32,149
we should be ambitious
frankly yeah and and

1872
00:30:32,149 --> 00:30:32,159
frankly yeah and and
 

1873
00:30:32,159 --> 00:30:34,470
frankly yeah and and
if we can use machine learning to help

1874
00:30:34,470 --> 00:30:34,480
if we can use machine learning to help
 

1875
00:30:34,480 --> 00:30:36,070
if we can use machine learning to help
do the proofs and so on as well

1876
00:30:36,070 --> 00:30:36,080
do the proofs and so on as well
 

1877
00:30:36,080 --> 00:30:38,070
do the proofs and so on as well
right then it's much easier to verify

1878
00:30:38,070 --> 00:30:38,080
right then it's much easier to verify
 

1879
00:30:38,080 --> 00:30:39,990
right then it's much easier to verify
that a proof is correct

1880
00:30:39,990 --> 00:30:40,000
that a proof is correct
 

1881
00:30:40,000 --> 00:30:41,350
that a proof is correct
than to come up with a proof in the

1882
00:30:41,350 --> 00:30:41,360
than to come up with a proof in the
 

1883
00:30:41,360 --> 00:30:44,070
than to come up with a proof in the
first place that's really the core idea

1884
00:30:44,070 --> 00:30:44,080
first place that's really the core idea
 

1885
00:30:44,080 --> 00:30:44,950
first place that's really the core idea
here

1886
00:30:44,950 --> 00:30:44,960
here
 

1887
00:30:44,960 --> 00:30:47,029
here
if someone comes on your on your podcast

1888
00:30:47,029 --> 00:30:47,039
if someone comes on your on your podcast

00:30:47,039 --> 00:30:48,789
if someone comes on your on your podcast
and says they they proved the riemann

1890
00:30:48,789 --> 00:30:48,799
and says they they proved the riemann

or some new sensational new theorem
 

1895
00:30:53,600 --> 00:30:57,029
or some new sensational new theorem
it's not me oh it's much easier for some

1896
00:30:57,029 --> 00:30:57,039
it's not me oh it's much easier for some
 

1897

students to check oh there's an error

1900
00:31:00,630 --> 00:31:00,640
students to check oh there's an error
 

1901
00:31:00,640 --> 00:31:02,389

here on equation equation five

1902
00:31:02,389 --> 00:31:02,399
here on equation equation five
 

1903
00:31:02,399 --> 00:31:04,710
here on equation equation five
or this really checks out than it was to

1904
00:31:04,710 --> 00:31:04,720
or this really checks out than it was to
 

1905
00:31:04,720 --> 00:31:06,950
or this really checks out than it was to
discover the proof

1906
00:31:06,950 --> 00:31:06,960
discover the proof
 

1907
00:31:06,960 --> 00:31:08,230
discover the proof
yeah although some of those proofs are

1908
00:31:08,230 --> 00:31:08,240
yeah although some of those proofs are
 

1909
00:31:08,240 --> 00:31:09,750
yeah although some of those proofs are
pretty complicated but yes it's still

1910
00:31:09,750 --> 00:31:09,760
pretty complicated but yes it's still
 

1911
00:31:09,760 --> 00:31:11,029
pretty complicated but yes it's still
nevertheless much easier

1912
00:31:11,029 --> 00:31:11,039
nevertheless much easier
 

1913
00:31:11,039 --> 00:31:13,269
nevertheless much easier
to uh to verify the proof i love the

1914
00:31:13,269 --> 00:31:13,279
to uh to verify the proof i love the
 

1915
00:31:13,279 --> 00:31:14,310
to uh to verify the proof i love the
optimism

1916
00:31:14,310 --> 00:31:14,320
optimism
 

1917
00:31:14,320 --> 00:31:16,149
optimism
you know we kind of even with the

1918
00:31:16,149 --> 00:31:16,159
you know we kind of even with the
 

1919
00:31:16,159 --> 00:31:17,350
you know we kind of even with the
security of systems

1920
00:31:17,350 --> 00:31:17,360
security of systems
 

1921
00:31:17,360 --> 00:31:21,350
security of systems
there's a kind of cynicism that pervades

1922
00:31:21,350 --> 00:31:21,360
there's a kind of cynicism that pervades
 

1923
00:31:21,360 --> 00:31:22,870
there's a kind of cynicism that pervades
people who think about this which is

1924
00:31:22,870 --> 00:31:22,880
people who think about this which is
 

1925
00:31:22,880 --> 00:31:24,789
people who think about this which is
like oh it's hopeless

1926
00:31:24,789 --> 00:31:24,799
like oh it's hopeless
 

1927
00:31:24,799 --> 00:31:26,549
like oh it's hopeless
i mean in the same sense exactly like

1928
00:31:26,549 --> 00:31:26,559
i mean in the same sense exactly like
 

1929
00:31:26,559 --> 00:31:27,909
i mean in the same sense exactly like
you're saying when y'all now work so

1930
00:31:27,909 --> 00:31:27,919
you're saying when y'all now work so
 

1931
00:31:27,919 --> 00:31:29,110
you're saying when y'all now work so
let's go must understand what's

1932
00:31:29,110 --> 00:31:29,120
let's go must understand what's
 

1933
00:31:29,120 --> 00:31:29,990
let's go must understand what's
happening

1934
00:31:29,990 --> 00:31:30,000
happening
 

1935
00:31:30,000 --> 00:31:31,990
happening
uh with security people are just like

1936
00:31:31,990 --> 00:31:32,000
uh with security people are just like
 

1937
00:31:32,000 --> 00:31:33,909
uh with security people are just like
well it's always going there's always

1938
00:31:33,909 --> 00:31:33,919
well it's always going there's always
 

1939
00:31:33,919 --> 00:31:35,430
well it's always going there's always
going to be

1940
00:31:35,430 --> 00:31:35,440
going to be
 

1941
00:31:35,440 --> 00:31:38,789
going to be
um attack vectors yeah like uh

1942
00:31:38,789 --> 00:31:38,799
um attack vectors yeah like uh
 

1943
00:31:38,799 --> 00:31:40,789
um attack vectors yeah like uh
waste ways to attack the system but

1944
00:31:40,789 --> 00:31:40,799
waste ways to attack the system but
 

1945
00:31:40,799 --> 00:31:42,230
waste ways to attack the system but
you're right we're just very new with

1946
00:31:42,230 --> 00:31:42,240
you're right we're just very new with
 

1947
00:31:42,240 --> 00:31:43,909
you're right we're just very new with
these computational systems

1948
00:31:43,909 --> 00:31:43,919
these computational systems
 

1949
00:31:43,919 --> 00:31:46,310
these computational systems
we're new with these intelligent systems

1950
00:31:46,310 --> 00:31:46,320
we're new with these intelligent systems
 

1951
00:31:46,320 --> 00:31:47,830
we're new with these intelligent systems
and and it's

1952
00:31:47,830 --> 00:31:47,840
and and it's
 

1953
00:31:47,840 --> 00:31:49,669
and and it's
not out of the realm of possibility just

1954
00:31:49,669 --> 00:31:49,679
not out of the realm of possibility just
 

1955
00:31:49,679 --> 00:31:51,430
not out of the realm of possibility just
like people didn't understand the

1956
00:31:51,430 --> 00:31:51,440
like people didn't understand the
 

1957
00:31:51,440 --> 00:31:52,870
like people didn't understand the
movement of the stars and the planets

1958
00:31:52,870 --> 00:31:52,880
movement of the stars and the planets
 

1959
00:31:52,880 --> 00:31:53,590
movement of the stars and the planets
and so on

1960
00:31:53,590 --> 00:31:53,600
and so on
 

1961
00:31:53,600 --> 00:31:56,149
and so on
yeah it's it's entirely possible that

1962
00:31:56,149 --> 00:31:56,159
yeah it's it's entirely possible that
 

1963
00:31:56,159 --> 00:31:56,870
yeah it's it's entirely possible that
like

1964
00:31:56,870 --> 00:31:56,880
like
 

1965
00:31:56,880 --> 00:31:58,710
like
within hopefully soon but it could be

1966
00:31:58,710 --> 00:31:58,720
within hopefully soon but it could be
 

1967
00:31:58,720 --> 00:32:00,310
within hopefully soon but it could be
within a hundred years

1968
00:32:00,310 --> 00:32:00,320
within a hundred years
 

1969
00:32:00,320 --> 00:32:03,029
within a hundred years
we start to have an obvious like laws of

1970
00:32:03,029 --> 00:32:03,039
we start to have an obvious like laws of
 

1971
00:32:03,039 --> 00:32:03,990
we start to have an obvious like laws of
gravity about

1972
00:32:03,990 --> 00:32:04,000
gravity about
 

1973

look at everything they do

00:33:28,799 --> 00:33:29,590
company if they get hacked you know and
have

2066
00:33:29,590 --> 00:33:29,600
have
 

2067
00:33:29,600 --> 00:33:32,070
have
the highest standards for them and then

2068
00:33:32,070 --> 00:33:32,080
the highest standards for them and then
 

2069
00:33:32,080 --> 00:33:33,669
the highest standards for them and then
they can save money by going

2070
00:33:33,669 --> 00:33:33,679
they can save money by going
 

2071
00:33:33,679 --> 00:33:35,190
they can save money by going
for the el cheapo poorly understood

for the el cheapo poorly understood
 

2073
00:33:35,200 --> 00:33:36,789
for the el cheapo poorly understood
stuff for the rest you know

2074
00:33:36,789 --> 00:33:36,799
stuff for the rest you know
 

2075
00:33:36,799 --> 00:33:39,190
stuff for the rest you know
this this is very feasible i think and

2076
00:33:39,190 --> 00:33:39,200
this this is very feasible i think and
 

2077
00:33:39,200 --> 00:33:40,789
this this is very feasible i think and
coming back to

2078
00:33:40,789 --> 00:33:40,799
coming back to
 

2079
00:33:40,799 --> 00:33:42,230
coming back to
the bigger question about that you

2080
00:33:42,230 --> 00:33:42,240
the bigger question about that you
 

2081
00:33:42,240 --> 00:33:43,830
the bigger question about that you
worried about that that there will be

2082
00:33:43,830 --> 00:33:43,840
worried about that that there will be
 

2083
00:33:43,840 --> 00:33:45,029
worried about that that there will be
unintentional

2084
00:33:45,029 --> 00:33:45,039
unintentional
 

2085
00:33:45,039 --> 00:33:46,789
unintentional
failures i think there are two quite

2086
00:33:46,789 --> 00:33:46,799
failures i think there are two quite
 

2087
00:33:46,799 --> 00:33:48,149
failures i think there are two quite
separate risks here right

2088
00:33:48,149 --> 00:33:48,159
separate risks here right
 

2089
00:33:48,159 --> 00:33:49,669
separate risks here right
we talked a lot about one of them which

2090
00:33:49,669 --> 00:33:49,679
we talked a lot about one of them which
 

2091
00:33:49,679 --> 00:33:52,630
we talked a lot about one of them which
is that the goals are noble of the human

2092
00:33:52,630 --> 00:33:52,640
is that the goals are noble of the human
 

2093
00:33:52,640 --> 00:33:55,509
is that the goals are noble of the human
the human says i want this airplane to

2094
00:33:55,509 --> 00:33:55,519
the human says i want this airplane to
 

2095
00:33:55,519 --> 00:33:56,710
the human says i want this airplane to
not crash

2096
00:33:56,710 --> 00:33:56,720
not crash
 

2097
00:33:56,720 --> 00:33:58,789
not crash
because this is not muhammad atta now

2098
00:33:58,789 --> 00:33:58,799
because this is not muhammad atta now
 

2099
00:33:58,799 --> 00:34:00,310
because this is not muhammad atta now
flying the airplane right

2100
00:34:00,310 --> 00:34:00,320
flying the airplane right
 

2101
00:34:00,320 --> 00:34:03,110
flying the airplane right
and now there's this technical challenge

2102
00:34:03,110 --> 00:34:03,120
and now there's this technical challenge
 

2103
00:34:03,120 --> 00:34:04,230
and now there's this technical challenge
of making sure that the

2104
00:34:04,230 --> 00:34:04,240
of making sure that the
 

2105
00:34:04,240 --> 00:34:06,070
of making sure that the
the autopilot is actually going to

2106
00:34:06,070 --> 00:34:06,080
the autopilot is actually going to
 

2107
00:34:06,080 --> 00:34:10,790
the autopilot is actually going to
behave as as the pilot wants

2108
00:34:10,790 --> 00:34:10,800

 

2109
00:34:10,800 --> 00:34:12,310

if you set that aside there's also the

2110
00:34:12,310 --> 00:34:12,320
if you set that aside there's also the
 

2111
00:34:12,320 --> 00:34:15,190
if you set that aside there's also the
separate question how do you make sure

2112
00:34:15,190 --> 00:34:15,200
separate question how do you make sure
 

2113
00:34:15,200 --> 00:34:17,829
separate question how do you make sure
that the goals of the pilot are actually

2114
00:34:17,829 --> 00:34:17,839
that the goals of the pilot are actually
 

2115
00:34:17,839 --> 00:34:19,510
that the goals of the pilot are actually
aligned with the goals of the passenger

2116
00:34:19,510 --> 00:34:19,520
aligned with the goals of the passenger
 

2117
00:34:19,520 --> 00:34:20,950
aligned with the goals of the passenger
how do you

2118
00:34:20,950 --> 00:34:20,960
how do you
 

2119
00:34:20,960 --> 00:34:23,109
how do you
make sure very much more broadly that if

2120
00:34:23,109 --> 00:34:23,119
make sure very much more broadly that if
 

2121
00:34:23,119 --> 00:34:24,710
make sure very much more broadly that if
we can all agree as a species that we

2122
00:34:24,710 --> 00:34:24,720
we can all agree as a species that we
 

2123
00:34:24,720 --> 00:34:26,149
we can all agree as a species that we
would like things to kind of go well for

2124
00:34:26,149 --> 00:34:26,159
would like things to kind of go well for
 

2125
00:34:26,159 --> 00:34:28,069
would like things to kind of go well for
humanity as a whole

2126
00:34:28,069 --> 00:34:28,079
humanity as a whole
 

2127
00:34:28,079 --> 00:34:30,310
humanity as a whole
that the goals are aligned here the

2128
00:34:30,310 --> 00:34:30,320
that the goals are aligned here the
 

2129
00:34:30,320 --> 00:34:31,430
that the goals are aligned here the
alignment problem

2130
00:34:31,430 --> 00:34:31,440
alignment problem
 

2131
00:34:31,440 --> 00:34:35,349
alignment problem
and um yeah there's been a lot of

2132
00:34:35,349 --> 00:34:35,359
and um yeah there's been a lot of
 

2133
00:34:35,359 --> 00:34:38,149
and um yeah there's been a lot of
progress in in the sense that there's

2134
00:34:38,149 --> 00:34:38,159
progress in in the sense that there's

00:36:46,230 --> 00:36:46,240
to do this they just hadn't thought to
 

2261
00:36:46,240 --> 00:36:48,390
to do this they just hadn't thought to
do the alignment and if you look at

2262
00:36:48,390 --> 00:36:48,400
do the alignment and if you look at
 

2263
00:36:48,400 --> 00:36:50,069
do the alignment and if you look at
more broadly problems that happen on

2264

think about let's go back really big

2272
00:36:58,230 --> 00:36:58,240
think about let's go back really big
 

2273
00:36:58,240 --> 00:37:00,870
think about let's go back really big
because i know this is you're so good

2274
00:37:00,870 --> 00:37:00,880
because i know this is you're so good
 

2275

because i know this is you're so good
yeah in the very so long ago in

2276
00:37:02,870 --> 00:37:02,880
yeah in the very so long ago in
 

2277
00:37:02,880 --> 00:37:05,109
yeah in the very so long ago in
evolution we had these genes

2278
00:37:05,109 --> 00:37:05,119
evolution we had these genes
 

2279
00:37:05,119 --> 00:37:07,109
evolution we had these genes
and you they wanted to make copies of

2280
00:37:07,109 --> 00:37:07,119
and you they wanted to make copies of
 

2281
00:37:07,119 --> 00:37:08,470
and you they wanted to make copies of
themselves that's really all they cared

2282
00:37:08,470 --> 00:37:08,480
themselves that's really all they cared
 

2283
00:37:08,480 --> 00:37:09,270
themselves that's really all they cared
about

2284
00:37:09,270 --> 00:37:09,280
about
 

2285
00:37:09,280 --> 00:37:13,910
about
so they some genes said hey i'm going to

2286
00:37:13,910 --> 00:37:13,920
so they some genes said hey i'm going to
 

2287
00:37:13,920 --> 00:37:16,150
so they some genes said hey i'm going to
build a brain on this body i'm in so

2288
00:37:16,150 --> 00:37:16,160
build a brain on this body i'm in so
 

2289
00:37:16,160 --> 00:37:18,069
build a brain on this body i'm in so
that i can get better at making copies

2290
00:37:18,069 --> 00:37:18,079
that i can get better at making copies
 

2291
00:37:18,079 --> 00:37:18,790
that i can get better at making copies
myself yes

2292
00:37:18,790 --> 00:37:18,800
myself yes
 

2293
00:37:18,800 --> 00:37:21,589
myself yes
and then they decided for their benefit

2294
00:37:21,589 --> 00:37:21,599
and then they decided for their benefit
 

2295
00:37:21,599 --> 00:37:21,990
and then they decided for their benefit
to get

2296
00:37:21,990 --> 00:37:22,000
to get
 

2297
00:37:22,000 --> 00:37:23,990
to get
copied more to align your brain's

2298
00:37:23,990 --> 00:37:24,000
copied more to align your brain's
 

2299
00:37:24,000 --> 00:37:25,109
copied more to align your brain's
incentives with

2300
00:37:25,109 --> 00:37:25,119
incentives with
 

2301
00:37:25,119 --> 00:37:28,310
incentives with
their incentives so it didn't want

2302
00:37:28,310 --> 00:37:28,320
their incentives so it didn't want
 

2303
00:37:28,320 --> 00:37:31,349
their incentives so it didn't want
you to starve to death so it gave you an

2304
00:37:31,349 --> 00:37:31,359
you to starve to death so it gave you an
 

2305
00:37:31,359 --> 00:37:33,190
you to starve to death so it gave you an
incentive to eat

2306
00:37:33,190 --> 00:37:33,200
incentive to eat
 

2307
00:37:33,200 --> 00:37:35,829
incentive to eat
and it wanted you to make copies of of

2308
00:37:35,829 --> 00:37:35,839
and it wanted you to make copies of of
 

2309
00:37:35,839 --> 00:37:36,550
and it wanted you to make copies of of
the genes

2310
00:37:36,550 --> 00:37:36,560
the genes
 

2311
00:37:36,560 --> 00:37:38,470
the genes
so it gave you incentive to fall in love

2312
00:37:38,470 --> 00:37:38,480
so it gave you incentive to fall in love
 

2313
00:37:38,480 --> 00:37:40,390
so it gave you incentive to fall in love
and

2314
00:37:40,390 --> 00:37:40,400
and
 

2315
00:37:40,400 --> 00:37:42,630
and
do all sorts of naughty things to make

2316
00:37:42,630 --> 00:37:42,640
do all sorts of naughty things to make
 

2317
00:37:42,640 --> 00:37:43,510
do all sorts of naughty things to make
copies of it

2318
00:37:43,510 --> 00:37:43,520
copies of it
 

2319
00:37:43,520 --> 00:37:45,750
copies of it
of itself right yeah so that was

2320
00:37:45,750 --> 00:37:45,760
of itself right yeah so that was
 

2321
00:37:45,760 --> 00:37:47,829
of itself right yeah so that was
successful value alignment done

2322
00:37:47,829 --> 00:37:47,839
successful value alignment done
 

2323
00:37:47,839 --> 00:37:49,750
successful value alignment done
on the genes but they created something

2324
00:37:49,750 --> 00:37:49,760
on the genes but they created something
 

2325
00:37:49,760 --> 00:37:51,430
on the genes but they created something
more intelligent than themselves

2326
00:37:51,430 --> 00:37:51,440
more intelligent than themselves
 

2327
00:37:51,440 --> 00:37:53,109
more intelligent than themselves
but they made sure to try to align the

2328
00:37:53,109 --> 00:37:53,119
but they made sure to try to align the
 

2329
00:37:53,119 --> 00:37:55,109
but they made sure to try to align the
values but then something went a little

2330
00:37:55,109 --> 00:37:55,119
values but then something went a little
 

2331
00:37:55,119 --> 00:37:56,230
values but then something went a little
bit

2332
00:37:56,230 --> 00:37:56,240
bit
 

2333
00:37:56,240 --> 00:37:59,109
bit
raw against the idea of what the genes

2334
00:37:59,109 --> 00:37:59,119
raw against the idea of what the genes
 

2335
00:37:59,119 --> 00:38:00,390
raw against the idea of what the genes
wanted because

2336
00:38:00,390 --> 00:38:00,400
wanted because
 

2337
00:38:00,400 --> 00:38:01,990
wanted because
a lot of humans discovered hey you know

2338
00:38:01,990 --> 00:38:02,000
a lot of humans discovered hey you know
 

2339
00:38:02,000 --> 00:38:04,069
a lot of humans discovered hey you know
yeah we really like this

2340
00:38:04,069 --> 00:38:04,079
yeah we really like this
 

2341
00:38:04,079 --> 00:38:06,069
yeah we really like this
business about sex that the genes have

2342
00:38:06,069 --> 00:38:06,079
business about sex that the genes have
 

2343
00:38:06,079 --> 00:38:07,510
business about sex that the genes have
made us enjoy

2344
00:38:07,510 --> 00:38:07,520
made us enjoy
 

2345
00:38:07,520 --> 00:38:09,270
made us enjoy
but we don't want to have babies right

2346
00:38:09,270 --> 00:38:09,280
but we don't want to have babies right
 

2347
00:38:09,280 --> 00:38:11,030
but we don't want to have babies right
now yeah so we're going to hack the

2348
00:38:11,030 --> 00:38:11,040
now yeah so we're going to hack the
 

2349
00:38:11,040 --> 00:38:12,230
now yeah so we're going to hack the
genes

2350
00:38:12,230 --> 00:38:12,240
genes
 

2351
00:38:12,240 --> 00:38:17,270
genes
and use birth control and i really feel

2352
00:38:17,270 --> 00:38:17,280
and use birth control and i really feel
 

2353
00:38:17,280 --> 00:38:19,190
and use birth control and i really feel
like drinking a coca-cola right now but

2354
00:38:19,190 --> 00:38:19,200
like drinking a coca-cola right now but
 

2355
00:38:19,200 --> 00:38:20,790
like drinking a coca-cola right now but
i don't want to get a potbelly so i'm

2356
00:38:20,790 --> 00:38:20,800
i don't want to get a potbelly so i'm
 

2357
00:38:20,800 --> 00:38:22,550
i don't want to get a potbelly so i'm
going to drink diet coke you know

2358
00:38:22,550 --> 00:38:22,560
going to drink diet coke you know
 

2359
00:38:22,560 --> 00:38:24,630
going to drink diet coke you know
we have all these things we've figured

2360
00:38:24,630 --> 00:38:24,640
we have all these things we've figured
 

2361
00:38:24,640 --> 00:38:26,870
we have all these things we've figured
out because we're smarter than the jeans

2362
00:38:26,870 --> 00:38:26,880
out because we're smarter than the jeans
 

2363
00:38:26,880 --> 00:38:28,550
out because we're smarter than the jeans
how we can actually subvert their

2364
00:38:28,550 --> 00:38:28,560
how we can actually subvert their
 

2365
00:38:28,560 --> 00:38:30,870
how we can actually subvert their
intentions so

2366
00:38:30,870 --> 00:38:30,880
intentions so
 

2367
00:38:30,880 --> 00:38:33,109
intentions so
it's not surprising that this we humans

2368
00:38:33,109 --> 00:38:33,119
it's not surprising that this we humans
 

2369
00:38:33,119 --> 00:38:34,390
it's not surprising that this we humans
now when we're in the role of these

2370
00:38:34,390 --> 00:38:34,400
now when we're in the role of these
 

2371
00:38:34,400 --> 00:38:35,270
now when we're in the role of these
genes creating

2372
00:38:35,270 --> 00:38:35,280
genes creating
 

2373
00:38:35,280 --> 00:38:36,790
genes creating
other non-human entities with a lot of

2374
00:38:36,790 --> 00:38:36,800
other non-human entities with a lot of
 

2375
00:38:36,800 --> 00:38:39,030
other non-human entities with a lot of
power have to face the same exact

2376
00:38:39,030 --> 00:38:39,040
power have to face the same exact
 

2377
00:38:39,040 --> 00:38:40,550
power have to face the same exact
challenge how do we make other powerful

2378
00:38:40,550 --> 00:38:40,560
challenge how do we make other powerful
 

2379
00:38:40,560 --> 00:38:42,710
challenge how do we make other powerful
entities have

2380
00:38:42,710 --> 00:38:42,720
entities have
 

2381
00:38:42,720 --> 00:38:45,190
entities have
incentives that are aligned with ours

2382
00:38:45,190 --> 00:38:45,200
incentives that are aligned with ours
 

2383
00:38:45,200 --> 00:38:46,950
incentives that are aligned with ours
and so they won't hack them

2384
00:38:46,950 --> 00:38:46,960
and so they won't hack them
 

2385
00:38:46,960 --> 00:38:49,349
and so they won't hack them
corporations for example right we humans

2386
00:38:49,349 --> 00:38:49,359
corporations for example right we humans
 

2387
00:38:49,359 --> 00:38:51,270
corporations for example right we humans
decided to create corporations

2388
00:38:51,270 --> 00:38:51,280
decided to create corporations
 

2389
00:38:51,280 --> 00:38:53,750
decided to create corporations
because can benefit us greatly now all

2390
00:38:53,750 --> 00:38:53,760
because can benefit us greatly now all
 

2391
00:38:53,760 --> 00:38:55,349
because can benefit us greatly now all
of a sudden there's a supermarket i can

2392
00:38:55,349 --> 00:38:55,359
of a sudden there's a supermarket i can
 

2393
00:38:55,359 --> 00:38:57,190
of a sudden there's a supermarket i can
go buy food there i don't have to hunt

2394
00:38:57,190 --> 00:38:57,200
go buy food there i don't have to hunt
 

2395
00:38:57,200 --> 00:39:00,310
go buy food there i don't have to hunt
awesome and then to

2396
00:39:00,310 --> 00:39:00,320
awesome and then to
 

2397
00:39:00,320 --> 00:39:03,510
awesome and then to
make sure that this corporation would do

2398
00:39:03,510 --> 00:39:03,520
make sure that this corporation would do
 

2399
00:39:03,520 --> 00:39:05,190
make sure that this corporation would do
things that were good for us and not bad

2400
00:39:05,190 --> 00:39:05,200
things that were good for us and not bad
 

2401
00:39:05,200 --> 00:39:07,270
things that were good for us and not bad
for us we created institutions to keep

2402
00:39:07,270 --> 00:39:07,280
for us we created institutions to keep
 

2403
00:39:07,280 --> 00:39:08,310
for us we created institutions to keep
them in check

2404
00:39:08,310 --> 00:39:08,320
them in check
 

2405
00:39:08,320 --> 00:39:11,109
them in check
like if the local supermarket sells

2406
00:39:11,109 --> 00:39:11,119
like if the local supermarket sells
 

2407
00:39:11,119 --> 00:39:12,829
like if the local supermarket sells
poisonous food

2408
00:39:12,829 --> 00:39:12,839
poisonous food
 

2409
00:39:12,839 --> 00:39:15,829
poisonous food
then those

2410
00:39:15,829 --> 00:39:15,839
then those
 

2411
00:39:15,839 --> 00:39:18,710
then those
some the owners of a supermarket have to

2412
00:39:18,710 --> 00:39:18,720
some the owners of a supermarket have to
 

2413
00:39:18,720 --> 00:39:20,470
some the owners of a supermarket have to
spend some years reflecting

2414
00:39:20,470 --> 00:39:20,480
spend some years reflecting
 

2415
00:39:20,480 --> 00:39:23,589
spend some years reflecting
behind bars right so we created

2416
00:39:23,589 --> 00:39:23,599
behind bars right so we created
 

2417
00:39:23,599 --> 00:39:25,910
behind bars right so we created
incentives to get align them but of

2418
00:39:25,910 --> 00:39:25,920
incentives to get align them but of
 

2419
00:39:25,920 --> 00:39:27,430
incentives to get align them but of
course just like we were able to see

2420
00:39:27,430 --> 00:39:27,440
course just like we were able to see
 

2421
00:39:27,440 --> 00:39:28,150
course just like we were able to see
through this thing

2422
00:39:28,150 --> 00:39:28,160
through this thing
 

2423
00:39:28,160 --> 00:39:30,630
through this thing
and you developed birth control if

2424
00:39:30,630 --> 00:39:30,640
and you developed birth control if
 

2425
00:39:30,640 --> 00:39:32,069
and you developed birth control if
you're powerful corporation you also

2426
00:39:32,069 --> 00:39:32,079
you're powerful corporation you also
 

2427
00:39:32,079 --> 00:39:34,150
you're powerful corporation you also
have an incentive to try to hack

2428
00:39:34,150 --> 00:39:34,160
have an incentive to try to hack
 

2429
00:39:34,160 --> 00:39:35,670
have an incentive to try to hack
the institutions that are supposed to

2430
00:39:35,670 --> 00:39:35,680
the institutions that are supposed to
 

2431
00:39:35,680 --> 00:39:37,510
the institutions that are supposed to
govern you because you ultimately as a

2432
00:39:37,510 --> 00:39:37,520
govern you because you ultimately as a
 

2433
00:39:37,520 --> 00:39:39,030
govern you because you ultimately as a
corporation have an incentive to

2434
00:39:39,030 --> 00:39:39,040
corporation have an incentive to
 

2435
00:39:39,040 --> 00:39:40,790
corporation have an incentive to
maximize your profit

2436
00:39:40,790 --> 00:39:40,800
maximize your profit
 

2437
00:39:40,800 --> 00:39:42,069
maximize your profit
it's like you have an incentive to

2438
00:39:42,069 --> 00:39:42,079
it's like you have an incentive to
 

2439
00:39:42,079 --> 00:39:44,150
it's like you have an incentive to
maximize the enjoyment your brain has

2440
00:39:44,150 --> 00:39:44,160
maximize the enjoyment your brain has
 

2441
00:39:44,160 --> 00:39:46,870
maximize the enjoyment your brain has
not for your genes so if they can figure

2442
00:39:46,870 --> 00:39:46,880
not for your genes so if they can figure
 

2443
00:39:46,880 --> 00:39:47,829
not for your genes so if they can figure
out a way of

2444
00:39:47,829 --> 00:39:47,839
out a way of
 

2445
00:39:47,839 --> 00:39:50,790
out a way of
of bribing regulators then they're going

2446
00:39:50,790 --> 00:39:50,800
of bribing regulators then they're going
 

2447
00:39:50,800 --> 00:39:52,310
of bribing regulators then they're going
to do that

2448
00:39:52,310 --> 00:39:52,320
to do that
 

2449
00:39:52,320 --> 00:39:54,390
to do that
in the u.s we kind of caught on to that

2450
00:39:54,390 --> 00:39:54,400
in the u.s we kind of caught on to that
 

2451
00:39:54,400 --> 00:39:56,470
in the u.s we kind of caught on to that
and made laws against corruption and

2452
00:39:56,470 --> 00:39:56,480
and made laws against corruption and
 

2453
00:39:56,480 --> 00:39:58,550
and made laws against corruption and
bribery

2454
00:39:58,550 --> 00:39:58,560
bribery
 

2455
00:39:58,560 --> 00:40:01,910
bribery
then in the late 1800s

2456
00:40:01,910 --> 00:40:01,920
then in the late 1800s
 

2457
00:40:01,920 --> 00:40:04,309
then in the late 1800s
teddy roosevelt realized that no we were

2458

00:42:48,319 --> 00:42:49,349
but the it seems that it kind of works
out like it's

00:42:49,349 --> 00:42:49,359
out like it's
 

2623
00:42:49,359 --> 00:42:51,190
out like it's

way to
 

2631
00:42:57,599 --> 00:43:00,230
way to
realign the values or keep the values

2632
00:43:00,230 --> 00:43:00,240
realign the values or keep the values
 

2633

it's almost um it finds a way like uh

00:43:04,870 --> 00:43:04,880
it's almost um it finds a way like uh

uh reset the system do you want i mean

2642
00:43:13,190 --> 00:43:13,200
uh reset the system do you want i mean
 

2643
00:43:13,200 --> 00:43:15,109
uh reset the system do you want i mean
do you have an explanation why that is

2644
00:43:15,109 --> 00:43:15,119
do you have an explanation why that is
 

2645
00:43:15,119 --> 00:43:17,190
do you have an explanation why that is
or is that just survivor bias

2646
00:43:17,190 --> 00:43:17,200
or is that just survivor bias
 

2647
00:43:17,200 --> 00:43:19,910
or is that just survivor bias
and also is that different somehow

2648
00:43:19,910 --> 00:43:19,920
and also is that different somehow
 

2649
00:43:19,920 --> 00:43:21,430
and also is that different somehow

i think there is one thing which has

00:43:35,680 --> 00:43:37,030
i think there is one thing which has

changed that's why
 

2665
00:43:37,040 --> 00:43:40,470
changed that's why
i'm not all optimistic that's why i

00:43:40,470 --> 00:43:40,480
i'm not all optimistic that's why i
 

2667

in this century

first just the big picture yeah

2678
00:43:53,589 --> 00:43:53,599
first just the big picture yeah
 

2679
00:43:53,599 --> 00:43:55,190
first just the big picture yeah
companies

2680
00:43:55,190 --> 00:43:55,200
companies
 

2681
00:43:55,200 --> 00:43:58,069
companies
need to have the right incentives even

2682
00:43:58,069 --> 00:43:58,079
need to have the right incentives even
 

2683
00:43:58,079 --> 00:43:59,270
need to have the right incentives even
governments right

2684
00:43:59,270 --> 00:43:59,280
governments right
 

2685
00:43:59,280 --> 00:44:02,390
governments right
we used to have governments usually

2686
00:44:02,390 --> 00:44:02,400
we used to have governments usually
 

2687
00:44:02,400 --> 00:44:03,750
we used to have governments usually
there were just some king

2688
00:44:03,750 --> 00:44:03,760
there were just some king
 

2689
00:44:03,760 --> 00:44:05,430
there were just some king
you know who was was the king because

2690
00:44:05,430 --> 00:44:05,440
you know who was was the king because
 

2691
00:44:05,440 --> 00:44:07,109
you know who was was the king because
his dad was the king you know

2692
00:44:07,109 --> 00:44:07,119
his dad was the king you know
 

2693
00:44:07,119 --> 00:44:10,550
his dad was the king you know
and and then there were some benefits of

2694
00:44:10,550 --> 00:44:10,560
and and then there were some benefits of
 

2695
00:44:10,560 --> 00:44:12,950
and and then there were some benefits of
having this powerful

2696
00:44:12,950 --> 00:44:12,960
having this powerful
 

2697
00:44:12,960 --> 00:44:15,190
having this powerful
kingdom because or empire of any sort

2698
00:44:15,190 --> 00:44:15,200
kingdom because or empire of any sort
 

2699
00:44:15,200 --> 00:44:16,069
kingdom because or empire of any sort
because then it could

2700
00:44:16,069 --> 00:44:16,079
because then it could
 

2701
00:44:16,079 --> 00:44:18,150
because then it could
prevent a lot of local squabbles so at

2702
00:44:18,150 --> 00:44:18,160
prevent a lot of local squabbles so at
 

2703
00:44:18,160 --> 00:44:19,430
prevent a lot of local squabbles so at
least everybody in that region would

2704
00:44:19,430 --> 00:44:19,440
least everybody in that region would
 

2705
00:44:19,440 --> 00:44:21,589
least everybody in that region would
stop warning against each other and

2706
00:44:21,589 --> 00:44:21,599
stop warning against each other and
 

2707
00:44:21,599 --> 00:44:23,589
stop warning against each other and
their incentives of different cities in

2708
00:44:23,589 --> 00:44:23,599
their incentives of different cities in
 

2709
00:44:23,599 --> 00:44:25,030
their incentives of different cities in
the kingdom became more aligned right

2710
00:44:25,030 --> 00:44:25,040
the kingdom became more aligned right
 

2711
00:44:25,040 --> 00:44:27,109
the kingdom became more aligned right
that's that was the whole selling point

2712
00:44:27,109 --> 00:44:27,119
that's that was the whole selling point
 

2713
00:44:27,119 --> 00:44:31,109
that's that was the whole selling point
harare yeah noah harari has a beautiful

2714
00:44:31,109 --> 00:44:31,119
harare yeah noah harari has a beautiful
 

2715
00:44:31,119 --> 00:44:34,710
harare yeah noah harari has a beautiful
piece on how empires were collaboration

2716
00:44:34,710 --> 00:44:34,720
piece on how empires were collaboration
 

2717
00:44:34,720 --> 00:44:35,990
piece on how empires were collaboration
enablers and then we also

2718
00:44:35,990 --> 00:44:36,000
enablers and then we also
 

2719
00:44:36,000 --> 00:44:37,829
enablers and then we also
hirari says invented money for that

2720
00:44:37,829 --> 00:44:37,839
hirari says invented money for that
 

2721
00:44:37,839 --> 00:44:39,349
hirari says invented money for that
reason so we could

2722
00:44:39,349 --> 00:44:39,359
reason so we could
 

2723
00:44:39,359 --> 00:44:41,670
reason so we could
have better alignment and we could do

2724
00:44:41,670 --> 00:44:41,680
have better alignment and we could do
 

2725
00:44:41,680 --> 00:44:44,069
have better alignment and we could do
trade even with people we didn't know

2726
00:44:44,069 --> 00:44:44,079
trade even with people we didn't know
 

2727
00:44:44,079 --> 00:44:45,510
trade even with people we didn't know
so this sort of stuff has been playing

2728
00:44:45,510 --> 00:44:45,520
so this sort of stuff has been playing
 

2729
00:44:45,520 --> 00:44:47,829
so this sort of stuff has been playing
out since time immemorial right

2730
00:44:47,829 --> 00:44:47,839
out since time immemorial right
 

2731
00:44:47,839 --> 00:44:50,309
out since time immemorial right
what's changed is that it happens on

2732
00:44:50,309 --> 00:44:50,319
what's changed is that it happens on
 

2733
00:44:50,319 --> 00:44:52,390
what's changed is that it happens on
ever larger scales right technology

2734
00:44:52,390 --> 00:44:52,400
ever larger scales right technology
 

2735
00:44:52,400 --> 00:44:53,910
ever larger scales right technology
keeps getting better because science

2736
00:44:53,910 --> 00:44:53,920
keeps getting better because science
 

2737
00:44:53,920 --> 00:44:55,670
keeps getting better because science
gets better so now we can communicate

2738
00:44:55,670 --> 00:44:55,680
gets better so now we can communicate
 

2739
00:44:55,680 --> 00:44:57,510
gets better so now we can communicate
over larger distances

2740
00:44:57,510 --> 00:44:57,520
over larger distances
 

2741
00:44:57,520 --> 00:44:59,270
over larger distances
transport things faster over larger

2742
00:44:59,270 --> 00:44:59,280
transport things faster over larger
 

2743
00:44:59,280 --> 00:45:00,550
transport things faster over larger
distances and so

2744
00:45:00,550 --> 00:45:00,560
distances and so
 

2745
00:45:00,560 --> 00:45:03,190
distances and so
the entities get ever bigger but our

2746
00:45:03,190 --> 00:45:03,200
the entities get ever bigger but our
 

2747
00:45:03,200 --> 00:45:05,349
the entities get ever bigger but our
planet is not getting bigger anymore

2748
00:45:05,349 --> 00:45:05,359
planet is not getting bigger anymore
 

2749
00:45:05,359 --> 00:45:07,349
planet is not getting bigger anymore
so in the past you could have one

2750
00:45:07,349 --> 00:45:07,359
so in the past you could have one
 

2751
00:45:07,359 --> 00:45:08,790
so in the past you could have one
experiment that just

2752
00:45:08,790 --> 00:45:08,800
experiment that just
 

2753
00:45:08,800 --> 00:45:11,910
experiment that just
totally screwed up like easter island

2754
00:45:11,910 --> 00:45:11,920
totally screwed up like easter island
 

2755
00:45:11,920 --> 00:45:14,390
totally screwed up like easter island
where they actually managed to have such

2756
00:45:14,390 --> 00:45:14,400
where they actually managed to have such
 

2757
00:45:14,400 --> 00:45:15,510
where they actually managed to have such
poor alignment that

2758
00:45:15,510 --> 00:45:15,520
poor alignment that
 

2759
00:45:15,520 --> 00:45:17,510
poor alignment that
when they went extinct people there

2760
00:45:17,510 --> 00:45:17,520
when they went extinct people there
 

2761
00:45:17,520 --> 00:45:19,030
when they went extinct people there
there was no one else to come back and

2762
00:45:19,030 --> 00:45:19,040
there was no one else to come back and
 

2763
00:45:19,040 --> 00:45:21,430
there was no one else to come back and
replace them right

2764
00:45:21,430 --> 00:45:21,440
replace them right
 

2765
00:45:21,440 --> 00:45:24,069
replace them right
if elon musk doesn't get us to mars and

2766
00:45:24,069 --> 00:45:24,079
if elon musk doesn't get us to mars and
 

2767
00:45:24,079 --> 00:45:24,550
if elon musk doesn't get us to mars and
then we

2768
00:45:24,550 --> 00:45:24,560
then we
 

2769
00:45:24,560 --> 00:45:27,990
then we
go extinct on a global scale and we're

2770
00:45:27,990 --> 00:45:28,000
go extinct on a global scale and we're
 

2771
00:45:28,000 --> 00:45:28,950
go extinct on a global scale and we're
not coming back

2772
00:45:28,950 --> 00:45:28,960
not coming back
 

2773
00:45:28,960 --> 00:45:31,430
not coming back
that's that's the fundamental difference

2774
00:45:31,430 --> 00:45:31,440
that's that's the fundamental difference
 

2775
00:45:31,440 --> 00:45:32,390
that's that's the fundamental difference
and that's an ex

2776
00:45:32,390 --> 00:45:32,400
and that's an ex
 

2777
00:45:32,400 --> 00:45:34,710
and that's an ex
mistake i would rather we don't make for

2778
00:45:34,710 --> 00:45:34,720
mistake i would rather we don't make for
 

2779
00:45:34,720 --> 00:45:35,750
mistake i would rather we don't make for
that reason

2780
00:45:35,750 --> 00:45:35,760
that reason
 

2781
00:45:35,760 --> 00:45:38,150
that reason
in the past of course history is full of

2782
00:45:38,150 --> 00:45:38,160
in the past of course history is full of
 

2783
00:45:38,160 --> 00:45:39,109
in the past of course history is full of
fiascos

2784
00:45:39,109 --> 00:45:39,119
fiascos
 

2785
00:45:39,119 --> 00:45:42,150
fiascos
right but it was never the whole planet

2786
00:45:42,150 --> 00:45:42,160
right but it was never the whole planet
 

2787
00:45:42,160 --> 00:45:44,630
right but it was never the whole planet
and and then okay now there's this nice

2788
00:45:44,630 --> 00:45:44,640
and and then okay now there's this nice
 

2789
00:45:44,640 --> 00:45:46,390
and and then okay now there's this nice
uninhabited land here some other people

2790
00:45:46,390 --> 00:45:46,400
uninhabited land here some other people
 

2791
00:45:46,400 --> 00:45:47,430
uninhabited land here some other people
could move in and

2792
00:45:47,430 --> 00:45:47,440
could move in and
 

2793
00:45:47,440 --> 00:45:50,950
could move in and
organize things better this is different

2794
00:45:50,950 --> 00:45:50,960
organize things better this is different
 

2795
00:45:50,960 --> 00:45:52,630
organize things better this is different
the second thing which is also different

2796
00:45:52,630 --> 00:45:52,640
the second thing which is also different
 

2797
00:45:52,640 --> 00:45:55,109
the second thing which is also different
is that technology

2798
00:45:55,109 --> 00:45:55,119
is that technology
 

2799
00:45:55,119 --> 00:45:58,069
is that technology
gives us so much more empowerment right

2800
00:45:58,069 --> 00:45:58,079
gives us so much more empowerment right
 

2801
00:45:58,079 --> 00:45:59,430
gives us so much more empowerment right
both to the good things and also to

2802
00:45:59,430 --> 00:45:59,440
both to the good things and also to
 

2803
00:45:59,440 --> 00:46:00,470
both to the good things and also to
screw up

2804
00:46:00,470 --> 00:46:00,480
screw up
 

2805
00:46:00,480 --> 00:46:02,790
screw up
in the stone age even if you had someone

2806
00:46:02,790 --> 00:46:02,800
in the stone age even if you had someone
 

2807
00:46:02,800 --> 00:46:04,630
in the stone age even if you had someone
whose goals were really poorly aligned

2808
00:46:04,630 --> 00:46:04,640
whose goals were really poorly aligned
 

2809
00:46:04,640 --> 00:46:06,309
whose goals were really poorly aligned
like maybe he was really pissed

2810
00:46:06,309 --> 00:46:06,319
like maybe he was really pissed
 

2811
00:46:06,319 --> 00:46:08,150
like maybe he was really pissed
off because his stone age girlfriend

2812
00:46:08,150 --> 00:46:08,160
off because his stone age girlfriend
 

2813
00:46:08,160 --> 00:46:09,750
off because his stone age girlfriend
dumped him and he just wanted to

2814
00:46:09,750 --> 00:46:09,760
dumped him and he just wanted to
 

2815
00:46:09,760 --> 00:46:11,430
dumped him and he just wanted to
if he wanted to like kill as many people

2816
00:46:11,430 --> 00:46:11,440
if he wanted to like kill as many people
 

2817
00:46:11,440 --> 00:46:13,109
if he wanted to like kill as many people
as he could yeah how many could he

2818
00:46:13,109 --> 00:46:13,119
as he could yeah how many could he
 

2819
00:46:13,119 --> 00:46:15,030
as he could yeah how many could he
really take out with a rock and a stick

2820
00:46:15,030 --> 00:46:15,040
really take out with a rock and a stick
 

2821
00:46:15,040 --> 00:46:17,030
really take out with a rock and a stick
before he was overpowered right right

2822
00:46:17,030 --> 00:46:17,040
before he was overpowered right right
 

2823
00:46:17,040 --> 00:46:21,670
before he was overpowered right right
just handful right yeah now

2824
00:46:21,670 --> 00:46:21,680

 

2825
00:46:21,680 --> 00:46:24,230

with today's technology if we have an

2826
00:46:24,230 --> 00:46:24,240
with today's technology if we have an
 

2827
00:46:24,240 --> 00:46:26,230
with today's technology if we have an
accidental nuclear war between

2828
00:46:26,230 --> 00:46:26,240
accidental nuclear war between
 

2829
00:46:26,240 --> 00:46:29,430
accidental nuclear war between
russia and the u.s which we almost have

2830
00:46:29,430 --> 00:46:29,440
russia and the u.s which we almost have
 

2831
00:46:29,440 --> 00:46:31,430
russia and the u.s which we almost have
about a dozen times and then we have a

2832
00:46:31,430 --> 00:46:31,440
about a dozen times and then we have a
 

2833
00:46:31,440 --> 00:46:33,109
about a dozen times and then we have a
nuclear winter it could take out seven

2834
00:46:33,109 --> 00:46:33,119
nuclear winter it could take out seven
 

2835
00:46:33,119 --> 00:46:34,630
nuclear winter it could take out seven
billion people

2836
00:46:34,630 --> 00:46:34,640
billion people
 

2837
00:46:34,640 --> 00:46:37,190
billion people
or six billion people we don't know uh

2838
00:46:37,190 --> 00:46:37,200
or six billion people we don't know uh
 

2839
00:46:37,200 --> 00:46:37,750
or six billion people we don't know uh
so this

2840
00:46:37,750 --> 00:46:37,760
so this
 

2841
00:46:37,760 --> 00:46:39,910
so this
the scale of the damage is bigger that

2842
00:46:39,910 --> 00:46:39,920
the scale of the damage is bigger that
 

2843
00:46:39,920 --> 00:46:41,270
the scale of the damage is bigger that
we can do and if

2844
00:46:41,270 --> 00:46:41,280
we can do and if
 

2845
00:46:41,280 --> 00:46:45,030
we can do and if
if um there's obviously no law of

2846
00:46:45,030 --> 00:46:45,040
if um there's obviously no law of
 

2847
00:46:45,040 --> 00:46:46,790
if um there's obviously no law of
physics that says that technology will

2848
00:46:46,790 --> 00:46:46,800
physics that says that technology will
 

2849
00:46:46,800 --> 00:46:48,870
physics that says that technology will
never get powerful enough that

2850
00:46:48,870 --> 00:46:48,880
never get powerful enough that
 

2851
00:46:48,880 --> 00:46:51,589
never get powerful enough that
we could wipe out our species entirely

2852
00:46:51,589 --> 00:46:51,599
we could wipe out our species entirely
 

2853
00:46:51,599 --> 00:46:52,790
we could wipe out our species entirely
that would just be

2854
00:46:52,790 --> 00:46:52,800
that would just be
 

2855
00:46:52,800 --> 00:46:54,550
that would just be
fantasy to think that science is somehow

2856
00:46:54,550 --> 00:46:54,560
fantasy to think that science is somehow
 

2857
00:46:54,560 --> 00:46:56,470
fantasy to think that science is somehow
doomed not get more powerful than that

2858
00:46:56,470 --> 00:46:56,480
doomed not get more powerful than that
 

2859
00:46:56,480 --> 00:46:57,190
doomed not get more powerful than that
right

2860
00:46:57,190 --> 00:46:57,200
right
 

2861
00:46:57,200 --> 00:46:59,589
right
and and it's not at all unfeasible in

2862
00:46:59,589 --> 00:46:59,599
and and it's not at all unfeasible in
 

2863
00:46:59,599 --> 00:47:01,349
and and it's not at all unfeasible in
our lifetime that someone could design a

2864
00:47:01,349 --> 00:47:01,359
our lifetime that someone could design a
 

2865
00:47:01,359 --> 00:47:02,950
our lifetime that someone could design a
designer pandemic

2866
00:47:02,950 --> 00:47:02,960
designer pandemic
 

2867
00:47:02,960 --> 00:47:04,710
designer pandemic
which spreads as easily as covet but

2868
00:47:04,710 --> 00:47:04,720
which spreads as easily as covet but
 

2869
00:47:04,720 --> 00:47:06,710
which spreads as easily as covet but
just basically kills everybody

2870
00:47:06,710 --> 00:47:06,720
just basically kills everybody
 

2871
00:47:06,720 --> 00:47:08,870
just basically kills everybody
we already had smallpox they killed

2872
00:47:08,870 --> 00:47:08,880
we already had smallpox they killed
 

2873
00:47:08,880 --> 00:47:11,270
we already had smallpox they killed
one-third of everybody who got it

2874
00:47:11,270 --> 00:47:11,280
one-third of everybody who got it
 

2875
00:47:11,280 --> 00:47:14,309
one-third of everybody who got it
and and um what do you think of the

2876
00:47:14,309 --> 00:47:14,319
and and um what do you think of the
 

2877
00:47:14,319 --> 00:47:15,750
and and um what do you think of the
here's an intuition maybe it's

2878
00:47:15,750 --> 00:47:15,760
here's an intuition maybe it's
 

2879
00:47:15,760 --> 00:47:18,069
here's an intuition maybe it's
completely naive and this optimistic

2880
00:47:18,069 --> 00:47:18,079
completely naive and this optimistic
 

2881
00:47:18,079 --> 00:47:19,670
completely naive and this optimistic
intuition i have which

2882
00:47:19,670 --> 00:47:19,680
intuition i have which
 

2883
00:47:19,680 --> 00:47:22,230
intuition i have which
it seems and maybe it's a biased

2884
00:47:22,230 --> 00:47:22,240
it seems and maybe it's a biased
 

2885
00:47:22,240 --> 00:47:23,349
it seems and maybe it's a biased
experience that i have

2886
00:47:23,349 --> 00:47:23,359
experience that i have
 

2887
00:47:23,359 --> 00:47:25,270
experience that i have
but it seems like the most brilliant

2888
00:47:25,270 --> 00:47:25,280
but it seems like the most brilliant
 

2889
00:47:25,280 --> 00:47:27,990
but it seems like the most brilliant
people i've met in my life

2890
00:47:27,990 --> 00:47:28,000
people i've met in my life
 

2891
00:47:28,000 --> 00:47:32,470
people i've met in my life
all are really like fundamentally good

2892
00:47:32,470 --> 00:47:32,480
all are really like fundamentally good
 

2893
00:47:32,480 --> 00:47:33,589
all are really like fundamentally good
human beings

2894
00:47:33,589 --> 00:47:33,599
human beings
 

2895
00:47:33,599 --> 00:47:36,790
human beings
and not like naive good like they really

2896
00:47:36,790 --> 00:47:36,800
and not like naive good like they really
 

2897
00:47:36,800 --> 00:47:38,309
and not like naive good like they really
want to do good for the world in a way

2898
00:47:38,309 --> 00:47:38,319
want to do good for the world in a way
 

2899
00:47:38,319 --> 00:47:38,710
want to do good for the world in a way
that

2900
00:47:38,710 --> 00:47:38,720
that
 

2901
00:47:38,720 --> 00:47:40,549
that
well maybe is aligned to my sense of

2902
00:47:40,549 --> 00:47:40,559
well maybe is aligned to my sense of
 

2903
00:47:40,559 --> 00:47:41,750
well maybe is aligned to my sense of
what good means

2904
00:47:41,750 --> 00:47:41,760
what good means
 

2905
00:47:41,760 --> 00:47:46,950
what good means
and so i have a sense that the

2906
00:47:46,950 --> 00:47:46,960

 

2907
00:47:46,960 --> 00:47:49,030

the people that will be defining the

2908
00:47:49,030 --> 00:47:49,040
the people that will be defining the
 

2909
00:47:49,040 --> 00:47:50,870
the people that will be defining the
very cutting edge of technology

2910
00:47:50,870 --> 00:47:50,880
very cutting edge of technology
 

2911
00:47:50,880 --> 00:47:53,270
very cutting edge of technology
there will be much more of the ones that

2912
00:47:53,270 --> 00:47:53,280
there will be much more of the ones that
 

2913
00:47:53,280 --> 00:47:54,710
there will be much more of the ones that
are doing good versus the ones that are

2914
00:47:54,710 --> 00:47:54,720
are doing good versus the ones that are
 

2915
00:47:54,720 --> 00:47:55,750
are doing good versus the ones that are
doing evil

2916
00:47:55,750 --> 00:47:55,760
doing evil
 

2917
00:47:55,760 --> 00:48:00,069
doing evil
so the race i'm optimistic on the

2918
00:48:00,069 --> 00:48:00,079
so the race i'm optimistic on the
 

2919
00:48:00,079 --> 00:48:02,390
so the race i'm optimistic on the
us always like last minute coming up

2920
00:48:02,390 --> 00:48:02,400
us always like last minute coming up
 

2921
00:48:02,400 --> 00:48:03,510
us always like last minute coming up
with a solution so

2922
00:48:03,510 --> 00:48:03,520
with a solution so
 

2923
00:48:03,520 --> 00:48:06,710
with a solution so
if there's an engineered pandemic that

2924
00:48:06,710 --> 00:48:06,720
if there's an engineered pandemic that
 

2925
00:48:06,720 --> 00:48:07,829
if there's an engineered pandemic that
has the

2926
00:48:07,829 --> 00:48:07,839
has the
 

2927
00:48:07,839 --> 00:48:10,390
has the
capability to destroy most of the human

2928
00:48:10,390 --> 00:48:10,400
capability to destroy most of the human
 

2929
00:48:10,400 --> 00:48:11,589
capability to destroy most of the human
civilization

2930
00:48:11,589 --> 00:48:11,599
civilization
 

2931
00:48:11,599 --> 00:48:14,470
civilization
it it feels like to me either leading up

2932
00:48:14,470 --> 00:48:14,480
it it feels like to me either leading up
 

2933
00:48:14,480 --> 00:48:14,950
it it feels like to me either leading up
to that

2934
00:48:14,950 --> 00:48:14,960
to that
 

2935
00:48:14,960 --> 00:48:19,430
to that
before or as it's going on there will be

2936
00:48:19,430 --> 00:48:19,440
before or as it's going on there will be
 

2937
00:48:19,440 --> 00:48:21,910
before or as it's going on there will be
we're able to rally the the collective

2938
00:48:21,910 --> 00:48:21,920
we're able to rally the the collective
 

2939
00:48:21,920 --> 00:48:23,670
we're able to rally the the collective
genius of the human species

2940
00:48:23,670 --> 00:48:23,680
genius of the human species
 

2941
00:48:23,680 --> 00:48:25,349
genius of the human species
i could tell by your smile that you're

2942
00:48:25,349 --> 00:48:25,359

preserving way and spreading that data
and utilizing that data to make

3106
00:51:08,870 --> 00:51:08,880
and utilizing that data to make
 

3107
00:51:08,880 --> 00:51:09,670
and utilizing that data to make
decisions

3108
00:51:09,670 --> 00:51:09,680
decisions
 

3109
00:51:09,680 --> 00:51:12,230
decisions
all that kind of stuff yeah i think when

3110
00:51:12,230 --> 00:51:12,240
all that kind of stuff yeah i think when
 

3111
00:51:12,240 --> 00:51:13,829
all that kind of stuff yeah i think when
something bad happens to me

3112
00:51:13,829 --> 00:51:13,839
something bad happens to me
 

3113
00:51:13,839 --> 00:51:16,950
something bad happens to me
i made myself uh a promise

3114
00:51:16,950 --> 00:51:16,960
i made myself uh a promise
 

3115
00:51:16,960 --> 00:51:20,390
i made myself uh a promise
many years ago that i would not

3116
00:51:20,390 --> 00:51:20,400

 

3117
00:51:20,400 --> 00:51:22,950

be a whiner so when something bad

3118
00:51:22,950 --> 00:51:22,960
be a whiner so when something bad
 

3119
00:51:22,960 --> 00:51:24,150
be a whiner so when something bad
happens to me

3120
00:51:24,150 --> 00:51:24,160
happens to me
 

3121
00:51:24,160 --> 00:51:27,030
happens to me
of course it's a process the

3122
00:51:27,030 --> 00:51:27,040
of course it's a process the
 

3123
00:51:27,040 --> 00:51:28,710
of course it's a process the
disappointment but then

3124
00:51:28,710 --> 00:51:28,720
disappointment but then
 

3125
00:51:28,720 --> 00:51:30,390
disappointment but then
i try to focus on what did i learn from

3126
00:51:30,390 --> 00:51:30,400
i try to focus on what did i learn from
 

3127
00:51:30,400 --> 00:51:32,230
i try to focus on what did i learn from
this that can make me a better person in

3128
00:51:32,230 --> 00:51:32,240
this that can make me a better person in
 

3129
00:51:32,240 --> 00:51:32,950
this that can make me a better person in
the future

3130
00:51:32,950 --> 00:51:32,960
the future
 

3131
00:51:32,960 --> 00:51:34,549
the future
and there's usually something to be

3132
00:51:34,549 --> 00:51:34,559
and there's usually something to be
 

3133
00:51:34,559 --> 00:51:36,150
and there's usually something to be
learned when i fail

3134
00:51:36,150 --> 00:51:36,160
learned when i fail
 

3135
00:51:36,160 --> 00:51:38,710
learned when i fail
and i think we should all ask ourselves

3136
00:51:38,710 --> 00:51:38,720
and i think we should all ask ourselves
 

3137
00:51:38,720 --> 00:51:39,190
and i think we should all ask ourselves
what

3138
00:51:39,190 --> 00:51:39,200
what
 

3139
00:51:39,200 --> 00:51:42,230
what
can we learn from the pandemic about how

3140
00:51:42,230 --> 00:51:42,240
can we learn from the pandemic about how
 

3141
00:51:42,240 --> 00:51:43,510
can we learn from the pandemic about how
we can do better in the future

3142
00:51:43,510 --> 00:51:43,520
we can do better in the future
 

3143
00:51:43,520 --> 00:51:45,829
we can do better in the future
and you mentioned there's a really good

3144
00:51:45,829 --> 00:51:45,839
and you mentioned there's a really good
 

3145
00:51:45,839 --> 00:51:48,390
and you mentioned there's a really good
lesson you know we were not as resilient

3146
00:51:48,390 --> 00:51:48,400
lesson you know we were not as resilient
 

3147
00:51:48,400 --> 00:51:51,190
lesson you know we were not as resilient
as we thought we were and we were not as

3148
00:51:51,190 --> 00:51:51,200
as we thought we were and we were not as
 

3149
00:51:51,200 --> 00:51:52,150
as we thought we were and we were not as
prepared

3150
00:51:52,150 --> 00:51:52,160
prepared
 

3151
00:51:52,160 --> 00:51:54,390
prepared
maybe as we wish we were you can even

3152
00:51:54,390 --> 00:51:54,400
maybe as we wish we were you can even
 

3153
00:51:54,400 --> 00:51:56,150
maybe as we wish we were you can even
see very stark contrast around the

3154
00:51:56,150 --> 00:51:56,160
see very stark contrast around the
 

3155
00:51:56,160 --> 00:51:57,270
see very stark contrast around the
planet

3156
00:51:57,270 --> 00:51:57,280
planet
 

3157
00:51:57,280 --> 00:52:00,069

south korea right they have over 50

3158
00:52:00,069 --> 00:52:00,079
south korea right they have over 50
 

3159
00:52:00,079 --> 00:52:01,589
south korea right they have over 50
million people

3160
00:52:01,589 --> 00:52:01,599
million people
 

3161
00:52:01,599 --> 00:52:02,950
million people
do you know how many deaths they have

3162
00:52:02,950 --> 00:52:02,960
do you know how many deaths they have
 

3163
00:52:02,960 --> 00:52:05,510
do you know how many deaths they have
from covet last time i checked

3164
00:52:05,510 --> 00:52:05,520
from covet last time i checked
 

3165
00:52:05,520 --> 00:52:08,870
from covet last time i checked
no about 500

3166
00:52:08,870 --> 00:52:08,880
no about 500
 

3167
00:52:08,880 --> 00:52:12,950
no about 500
why is that well

3168
00:52:12,950 --> 00:52:12,960

 

3169
00:52:12,960 --> 00:52:14,630

the short answer is that they had

3170
00:52:14,630 --> 00:52:14,640
the short answer is that they had
 

3171
00:52:14,640 --> 00:52:16,790
the short answer is that they had
prepared

3172
00:52:16,790 --> 00:52:16,800
prepared
 

3173
00:52:16,800 --> 00:52:19,750
prepared
they were incredibly quick incredibly

3174
00:52:19,750 --> 00:52:19,760
they were incredibly quick incredibly
 

3175
00:52:19,760 --> 00:52:21,510
they were incredibly quick incredibly
quick to get on it

3176
00:52:21,510 --> 00:52:21,520
quick to get on it
 

3177
00:52:21,520 --> 00:52:23,910
quick to get on it
with very rapid testing and contact

3178
00:52:23,910 --> 00:52:23,920
with very rapid testing and contact
 

3179
00:52:23,920 --> 00:52:24,549
with very rapid testing and contact
tracing

3180
00:52:24,549 --> 00:52:24,559
tracing
 

3181
00:52:24,559 --> 00:52:27,270
tracing
and so on which is why they never had

3182
00:52:27,270 --> 00:52:27,280
and so on which is why they never had
 

3183
00:52:27,280 --> 00:52:28,870
and so on which is why they never had
more cases than they could contract

3184
00:52:28,870 --> 00:52:28,880
more cases than they could contract
 

3185
00:52:28,880 --> 00:52:30,470
more cases than they could contract
trace effectively right they never even

3186
00:52:30,470 --> 00:52:30,480
trace effectively right they never even
 

3187
00:52:30,480 --> 00:52:32,069
trace effectively right they never even
had to have the kind of big lockdowns we

3188
00:52:32,069 --> 00:52:32,079
had to have the kind of big lockdowns we
 

3189
00:52:32,079 --> 00:52:33,670
had to have the kind of big lockdowns we
had in the west

3190
00:52:33,670 --> 00:52:33,680
had in the west
 

3191
00:52:33,680 --> 00:52:37,030
had in the west
but the deeper answer to it's not just

3192
00:52:37,030 --> 00:52:37,040
but the deeper answer to it's not just
 

3193
00:52:37,040 --> 00:52:38,470
but the deeper answer to it's not just
the koreans are just somehow better

3194
00:52:38,470 --> 00:52:38,480
the koreans are just somehow better
 

3195
00:52:38,480 --> 00:52:38,950
the koreans are just somehow better
people

3196
00:52:38,950 --> 00:52:38,960
people
 

3197
00:52:38,960 --> 00:52:40,390
people
the reason i think they were better

3198
00:52:40,390 --> 00:52:40,400
the reason i think they were better
 

3199
00:52:40,400 --> 00:52:41,990
the reason i think they were better
prepared was because they

3200
00:52:41,990 --> 00:52:42,000
prepared was because they
 

3201
00:52:42,000 --> 00:52:45,270
prepared was because they
had already had a pretty bad hit

3202
00:52:45,270 --> 00:52:45,280
had already had a pretty bad hit
 

3203
00:52:45,280 --> 00:52:48,069
had already had a pretty bad hit
from the sars pandemic or which never

3204
00:52:48,069 --> 00:52:48,079
from the sars pandemic or which never
 

3205
00:52:48,079 --> 00:52:49,829
from the sars pandemic or which never
became a pandemic

3206
00:52:49,829 --> 00:52:49,839
became a pandemic
 

3207
00:52:49,839 --> 00:52:52,150
became a pandemic
something like 17 years ago i think so

3208
00:52:52,150 --> 00:52:52,160
something like 17 years ago i think so
 

3209
00:52:52,160 --> 00:52:53,670
something like 17 years ago i think so
it's kind of fresh memory that you know

3210
00:52:53,670 --> 00:52:53,680
it's kind of fresh memory that you know
 

3211
00:52:53,680 --> 00:52:55,910
it's kind of fresh memory that you know
we need to be prepared for pandemics

3212
00:52:55,910 --> 00:52:55,920
we need to be prepared for pandemics
 

3213
00:52:55,920 --> 00:52:59,030
we need to be prepared for pandemics
so they were right and

3214
00:52:59,030 --> 00:52:59,040
so they were right and
 

3215
00:52:59,040 --> 00:53:01,589
so they were right and
so maybe this is a lesson here for all

3216
00:53:01,589 --> 00:53:01,599
so maybe this is a lesson here for all
 

3217
00:53:01,599 --> 00:53:02,549
so maybe this is a lesson here for all
of us to draw

3218
00:53:02,549 --> 00:53:02,559
of us to draw
 

3219
00:53:02,559 --> 00:53:05,109
of us to draw
from covid that rather than just wait

3220
00:53:05,109 --> 00:53:05,119
from covid that rather than just wait
 

3221
00:53:05,119 --> 00:53:06,950
from covid that rather than just wait
for the next pandemic or the next

3222
00:53:06,950 --> 00:53:06,960
for the next pandemic or the next
 

3223
00:53:06,960 --> 00:53:09,750
for the next pandemic or the next
problem with ai getting out of control

00:53:11,190 --> 00:53:11,200
or anything else
 

3227
00:53:11,200 --> 00:53:14,630
or anything else
maybe we should just actually set aside

3228
00:53:14,630 --> 00:53:14,640
maybe we should just actually set aside
 

3229
00:53:14,640 --> 00:53:17,589
maybe we should just actually set aside
a tiny fraction of our gdp

3230
00:53:17,589 --> 00:53:17,599

what are the things that could go wrong

3236
00:53:23,190 --> 00:53:23,200
what are the things that could go wrong
 

3237
00:53:23,200 --> 00:53:24,790
what are the things that could go wrong
and let's duke it out and see which are

3238
00:53:24,790 --> 00:53:24,800
and let's duke it out and see which are
 

3239
00:53:24,800 --> 00:53:26,309
and let's duke it out and see which are
the more likely ones and which are the

3240
00:53:26,309 --> 00:53:26,319
the more likely ones and which are the
 

3241
00:53:26,319 --> 00:53:28,630
the more likely ones and which are the

3431
00:56:36,079 --> 00:56:37,109
and so how do you reconcile this with
with this

3432
00:56:37,109 --> 00:56:37,119
with this
 

3433
00:56:37,119 --> 00:56:40,390
with this
intrinsic goodness i and people i

3434
00:56:40,390 --> 00:56:40,400
intrinsic goodness i and people i
 

3435
00:56:40,400 --> 00:56:42,230
intrinsic goodness i and people i
i think it's pretty obvious that it has

3436
00:56:42,230 --> 00:56:42,240
i think it's pretty obvious that it has
 

3437
00:56:42,240 --> 00:56:43,670
i think it's pretty obvious that it has
again to do with this with the

3438
00:56:43,670 --> 00:56:43,680
again to do with this with the
 

3439
00:56:43,680 --> 00:56:45,349
again to do with this with the
information they were fed

3440
00:56:45,349 --> 00:56:45,359
information they were fed
 

3441
00:56:45,359 --> 00:56:49,589
information they were fed
and given right we evolved to live in

3442
00:56:49,589 --> 00:56:49,599
and given right we evolved to live in
 

3443
00:56:49,599 --> 00:56:51,589
and given right we evolved to live in
small groups where you might know 30

3444
00:56:51,589 --> 00:56:51,599
small groups where you might know 30
 

3445
00:56:51,599 --> 00:56:53,910
small groups where you might know 30
people in total right so you

3446
00:56:53,910 --> 00:56:53,920
people in total right so you
 

3447
00:56:53,920 --> 00:56:56,150
people in total right so you
then had a system that was quite good

3448
00:56:56,150 --> 00:56:56,160
then had a system that was quite good
 

3449
00:56:56,160 --> 00:56:57,589
then had a system that was quite good
for assessing who you could trust and

3450
00:56:57,589 --> 00:56:57,599
for assessing who you could trust and
 

3451
00:56:57,599 --> 00:56:59,430
for assessing who you could trust and
who you could not and if someone told

3452
00:56:59,430 --> 00:56:59,440
who you could not and if someone told
 

3453
00:56:59,440 --> 00:56:59,750
who you could not and if someone told
you

3454
00:56:59,750 --> 00:56:59,760
you
 

3455
00:56:59,760 --> 00:57:03,510
you
that you know joe there is a jerk

3456
00:57:03,510 --> 00:57:03,520
that you know joe there is a jerk
 

3457
00:57:03,520 --> 00:57:05,670
that you know joe there is a jerk
but you had interacted with him yourself

3458
00:57:05,670 --> 00:57:05,680
but you had interacted with him yourself
 

3459
00:57:05,680 --> 00:57:07,190
but you had interacted with him yourself
and seen him in action and

3460
00:57:07,190 --> 00:57:07,200
and seen him in action and
 

3461
00:57:07,200 --> 00:57:09,109
and seen him in action and
and you would quickly realize maybe that

3462
00:57:09,109 --> 00:57:09,119
and you would quickly realize maybe that
 

3463
00:57:09,119 --> 00:57:10,390
and you would quickly realize maybe that
that's actually not

3464
00:57:10,390 --> 00:57:10,400
that's actually not
 

3465
00:57:10,400 --> 00:57:13,190
that's actually not
quite accurate right but now that we the

3466
00:57:13,190 --> 00:57:13,200
quite accurate right but now that we the
 

3467
00:57:13,200 --> 00:57:14,390
quite accurate right but now that we the
most people on the planet are people

3468
00:57:14,390 --> 00:57:14,400
most people on the planet are people
 

3469
00:57:14,400 --> 00:57:15,910
most people on the planet are people
we've never met

3470
00:57:15,910 --> 00:57:15,920
we've never met
 

3471
00:57:15,920 --> 00:57:17,109
we've never met
it's very important that we have a way

3472
00:57:17,109 --> 00:57:17,119
it's very important that we have a way
 

3473
00:57:17,119 --> 00:57:19,270
it's very important that we have a way
of trusting the information we're given

3474
00:57:19,270 --> 00:57:19,280
of trusting the information we're given
 

3475
00:57:19,280 --> 00:57:22,390
of trusting the information we're given
and so okay so where does the news

and
 

3595
00:59:16,880 --> 00:59:19,910
and
long we got these amazing filter bubbles

3596
00:59:19,910 --> 00:59:19,920
long we got these amazing filter bubbles
 

3597
00:59:19,920 --> 00:59:21,910
long we got these amazing filter bubbles
on a scale we had never seen before

only there's
 

3609
00:59:32,480 --> 00:59:34,150
only there's
less than half as many journalists now

3610

3931
01:05:04,880 --> 01:05:06,710

that's good but when you when once you

3932
01:05:06,710 --> 01:05:06,720
that's good but when you when once you
 

3933
01:05:06,720 --> 01:05:08,150
that's good but when you when once you
realize that you realize there's also

realize that you realize there's also
 

3935
01:05:08,160 --> 01:05:09,430
realize that you realize there's also
something very optimistic there that you

01:05:09,430 --> 01:05:09,440
something very optimistic there that you
 

3937
01:05:09,440 --> 01:05:10,470
something very optimistic there that you
can do about it right

3938
01:05:10,470 --> 01:05:10,480
can do about it right
 

3939
01:05:10,480 --> 01:05:13,990
can do about it right
because first of all omissions

3940
01:05:13,990 --> 01:05:14,000
because first of all omissions
 

3941
01:05:14,000 --> 01:05:15,510
because first of all omissions
as long as there's no outright

3942
01:05:15,510 --> 01:05:15,520
as long as there's no outright
 

3943
01:05:15,520 --> 01:05:17,990
as long as there's no outright
censorship you can just look at both

3944
01:05:17,990 --> 01:05:18,000
censorship you can just look at both
 

3945
01:05:18,000 --> 01:05:19,750
censorship you can just look at both
sides

3946
01:05:19,750 --> 01:05:19,760
sides
 

3947
01:05:19,760 --> 01:05:23,190
sides
and pretty quickly piece together a much

3948
01:05:23,190 --> 01:05:23,200
and pretty quickly piece together a much
 

3949
01:05:23,200 --> 01:05:24,549
and pretty quickly piece together a much
more accurate idea of what's actually

3950
01:05:24,549 --> 01:05:24,559
more accurate idea of what's actually
 

3951
01:05:24,559 --> 01:05:27,029
more accurate idea of what's actually
going on right and develop a natural

3952
01:05:27,029 --> 01:05:27,039
going on right and develop a natural
 

3953
01:05:27,039 --> 01:05:28,069
going on right and develop a natural
skepticism too

3954
01:05:28,069 --> 01:05:28,079
skepticism too
 

3955
01:05:28,079 --> 01:05:31,190
skepticism too
yeah just a analytical scientific

3956
01:05:31,190 --> 01:05:31,200
yeah just a analytical scientific
 

3957
01:05:31,200 --> 01:05:32,470
yeah just a analytical scientific
mind about how you're taking the

what i tried to do with with this app is
that the

3990
01:06:03,029 --> 01:06:03,039
that the
 

3991
01:06:03,039 --> 01:06:06,069
that the
big tech has to some extent uh try to

3992
01:06:06,069 --> 01:06:06,079
big tech has to some extent uh try to
 

3993
01:06:06,079 --> 01:06:07,910
big tech has to some extent uh try to
blame the individual

for smoking and then
later on you know our government stepped

later on you know our government stepped
 

4005
01:06:16,480 --> 01:06:18,069
later on you know our government stepped
up and said actually you know

4241
01:09:59,440 --> 01:10:00,630
and so on and if you want to if you want
to get a more nuanced

4242
01:10:00,630 --> 01:10:00,640
to get a more nuanced
 

4243
01:10:00,640 --> 01:10:01,669
to get a more nuanced
understanding of what's happening

4244
01:10:01,669 --> 01:10:01,679
understanding of what's happening
 

4245
01:10:01,679 --> 01:10:04,310
understanding of what's happening
geopolitically then it's really fun to

4246
01:10:04,310 --> 01:10:04,320
geopolitically then it's really fun to
 

4247
01:10:04,320 --> 01:10:04,950
geopolitically then it's really fun to
look at this

4248
01:10:04,950 --> 01:10:04,960
look at this
 

4249
01:10:04,960 --> 01:10:06,870
look at this
establishment slider because it turns

4250
01:10:06,870 --> 01:10:06,880
establishment slider because it turns
 

4251
01:10:06,880 --> 01:10:08,149
establishment slider because it turns
out there are tons of

4252
01:10:08,149 --> 01:10:08,159
out there are tons of
 

4253
01:10:08,159 --> 01:10:10,070
out there are tons of
little newspapers both on the left and

4254
01:10:10,070 --> 01:10:10,080
little newspapers both on the left and
 

4255
01:10:10,080 --> 01:10:11,189
little newspapers both on the left and
on the right

01:10:11,189 --> 01:10:11,199
on the right
 

4257
01:10:11,199 --> 01:10:13,990
on the right
who sometimes challenge establishment

4258
01:10:13,990 --> 01:10:14,000
who sometimes challenge establishment
 

4259
01:10:14,000 --> 01:10:14,390
who sometimes challenge establishment
and say

4260
01:10:14,390 --> 01:10:14,400
and say
 

4261
01:10:14,400 --> 01:10:16,390
and say
you know maybe we shouldn't actually

4262
01:10:16,390 --> 01:10:16,400
you know maybe we shouldn't actually
 

4263
01:10:16,400 --> 01:10:18,470
you know maybe we shouldn't actually
invade iraq right now maybe this weapons

4264
01:10:18,470 --> 01:10:18,480
invade iraq right now maybe this weapons
 

4265
01:10:18,480 --> 01:10:20,310
invade iraq right now maybe this weapons
and mass destruction thing was bs

4266
01:10:20,310 --> 01:10:20,320
and mass destruction thing was bs
 

4267
01:10:20,320 --> 01:10:22,950
and mass destruction thing was bs
if you look at the journalism research

4268
01:10:22,950 --> 01:10:22,960
if you look at the journalism research
 

4269
01:10:22,960 --> 01:10:24,470
if you look at the journalism research
afterwards you can actually see that

4270
01:10:24,470 --> 01:10:24,480
afterwards you can actually see that
 

4271
01:10:24,480 --> 01:10:25,830
afterwards you can actually see that
quite clearly that both

4272
01:10:25,830 --> 01:10:25,840
quite clearly that both
 

4273
01:10:25,840 --> 01:10:29,030
quite clearly that both
cnn and fox were very pro

4274
01:10:29,030 --> 01:10:29,040
cnn and fox were very pro
 

4275
01:10:29,040 --> 01:10:30,790
cnn and fox were very pro
let's and get rid of saddam there are

4276
01:10:30,790 --> 01:10:30,800
let's and get rid of saddam there are
 

4277
01:10:30,800 --> 01:10:32,310
let's and get rid of saddam there are
weapons of mass destruction

4278
01:10:32,310 --> 01:10:32,320
weapons of mass destruction
 

4279
01:10:32,320 --> 01:10:33,430
weapons of mass destruction
then there were a lot of smaller

4280
01:10:33,430 --> 01:10:33,440
then there were a lot of smaller
 

4281
01:10:33,440 --> 01:10:35,990
then there were a lot of smaller
newspapers they were like wait a minute

4282
01:10:35,990 --> 01:10:36,000
newspapers they were like wait a minute
 

4283
01:10:36,000 --> 01:10:38,550
newspapers they were like wait a minute
this evidence seems a bit sketchy and

4284
01:10:38,550 --> 01:10:38,560
this evidence seems a bit sketchy and
 

4285
01:10:38,560 --> 01:10:40,070
this evidence seems a bit sketchy and
maybe we

4286
01:10:40,070 --> 01:10:40,080
maybe we
 

4287
01:10:40,080 --> 01:10:42,070
maybe we
but of course they were so hard to find

4288
01:10:42,070 --> 01:10:42,080
but of course they were so hard to find
 

4289
01:10:42,080 --> 01:10:43,110
but of course they were so hard to find
most people didn't even know they

4290
01:10:43,110 --> 01:10:43,120
most people didn't even know they
 

4291
01:10:43,120 --> 01:10:44,550
most people didn't even know they
existed right

4292
01:10:44,550 --> 01:10:44,560
existed right
 

4293
01:10:44,560 --> 01:10:45,830
existed right
yet it would have been better for

4294
01:10:45,830 --> 01:10:45,840
yet it would have been better for
 

4295
01:10:45,840 --> 01:10:47,750
yet it would have been better for
american national security if those

4296
01:10:47,750 --> 01:10:47,760
american national security if those
 

4297
01:10:47,760 --> 01:10:50,070
american national security if those
voices had also come up

4298
01:10:50,070 --> 01:10:50,080
voices had also come up
 

4299
01:10:50,080 --> 01:10:51,750
voices had also come up
i think it harmed america's national

4300
01:10:51,750 --> 01:10:51,760
i think it harmed america's national
 

4301
01:10:51,760 --> 01:10:53,669
i think it harmed america's national
security actually that we invaded iraq

4302
01:10:53,669 --> 01:10:53,679
security actually that we invaded iraq
 

4303
01:10:53,679 --> 01:10:55,510
security actually that we invaded iraq
and arguably there's a lot more interest

4304
01:10:55,510 --> 01:10:55,520
and arguably there's a lot more interest
 

4305
01:10:55,520 --> 01:10:56,709
and arguably there's a lot more interest
in

4306
01:10:56,709 --> 01:10:56,719
in
 

4307
01:10:56,719 --> 01:10:59,110
in
that kind of thinking too from those

4308
01:10:59,110 --> 01:10:59,120
that kind of thinking too from those
 

4309
01:10:59,120 --> 01:11:00,390
that kind of thinking too from those
small sources

4310
01:11:00,390 --> 01:11:00,400
small sources
 

4311
01:11:00,400 --> 01:11:03,030
small sources
so like the when you say big it's more

4312
01:11:03,030 --> 01:11:03,040
so like the when you say big it's more
 

4313
01:11:03,040 --> 01:11:03,750
so like the when you say big it's more
about

4314
01:11:03,750 --> 01:11:03,760
about
 

4315
01:11:03,760 --> 01:11:08,630
about
kind of uh the reach of the broadcast

4316
01:11:08,630 --> 01:11:08,640
kind of uh the reach of the broadcast
 

4317
01:11:08,640 --> 01:11:10,830
kind of uh the reach of the broadcast
but it's not big in terms of the

4318
01:11:10,830 --> 01:11:10,840
but it's not big in terms of the
 

4319
01:11:10,840 --> 01:11:12,630
but it's not big in terms of the
interest i think

4320
01:11:12,630 --> 01:11:12,640
interest i think
 

4321
01:11:12,640 --> 01:11:14,149
interest i think
i think there's a lot of interest in

4322
01:11:14,149 --> 01:11:14,159
i think there's a lot of interest in
 

4323
01:11:14,159 --> 01:11:16,470
i think there's a lot of interest in
that kind of anti-establishment or like

4324
01:11:16,470 --> 01:11:16,480
that kind of anti-establishment or like
 

4325
01:11:16,480 --> 01:11:18,470
that kind of anti-establishment or like
skepticism towards

4326
01:11:18,470 --> 01:11:18,480
skepticism towards
 

4327
01:11:18,480 --> 01:11:20,470
skepticism towards
you know out-of-the-box thinking there's

4328
01:11:20,470 --> 01:11:20,480
you know out-of-the-box thinking there's
 

4329
01:11:20,480 --> 01:11:21,910
you know out-of-the-box thinking there's
a lot of interest in that kind of thing

4330
01:11:21,910 --> 01:11:21,920
a lot of interest in that kind of thing
 

4331
01:11:21,920 --> 01:11:25,189
a lot of interest in that kind of thing
do you see this news project or

4332
01:11:25,189 --> 01:11:25,199
do you see this news project or
 

4333
01:11:25,199 --> 01:11:28,950
do you see this news project or
something like it being um

the main way we consume information like

4338
01:11:33,030 --> 01:11:33,040
the main way we consume information like
 

4339
01:11:33,040 --> 01:11:34,149
the main way we consume information like
what's how do we get

4340
01:11:34,149 --> 01:11:34,159
what's how do we get
 

4341
01:11:34,159 --> 01:11:36,870
what's how do we get
how do we get there like how do we you

4342
01:11:36,870 --> 01:11:36,880
how do we get there like how do we you
 

4343
01:11:36,880 --> 01:11:37,270
how do we get there like how do we you
know

4344
01:11:37,270 --> 01:11:37,280
know
 

4345
01:11:37,280 --> 01:11:39,430
know
so okay the idea is brilliant it's a

4346
01:11:39,430 --> 01:11:39,440
so okay the idea is brilliant it's a

project
 

4351
01:11:43,040 --> 01:11:45,910
project
in 2020 but how does that become the new

4352
01:11:45,910 --> 01:11:45,920
in 2020 but how does that become the new
 

4353
01:11:45,920 --> 01:11:47,270
in 2020 but how does that become the new

way we consume
 

4355
01:11:47,280 --> 01:11:49,510
way we consume
information i hope first of all just to

4356
01:11:49,510 --> 01:11:49,520
information i hope first of all just to
 

4357
01:11:49,520 --> 01:11:52,310
information i hope first of all just to
plan the little seed there because

4358
01:11:52,310 --> 01:11:52,320
plan the little seed there because
 

4359

01:12:09,199 --> 01:12:11,030
off of it
and we just train machine learning

4380
01:12:11,030 --> 01:12:11,040
and we just train machine learning
 

4381
01:12:11,040 --> 01:12:12,870
and we just train machine learning
algorithms to classify the articles and

4382
01:12:12,870 --> 01:12:12,880
algorithms to classify the articles and
 

4383
01:12:12,880 --> 01:12:14,790
algorithms to classify the articles and
stuff so it just kind of runs by itself

4384
01:12:14,790 --> 01:12:14,800
stuff so it just kind of runs by itself
 

4385
01:12:14,800 --> 01:12:15,189
stuff so it just kind of runs by itself
so

4386
01:12:15,189 --> 01:12:15,199
so
 

4387
01:12:15,199 --> 01:12:17,430
so
if it actually gets good enough at some

4388
01:12:17,430 --> 01:12:17,440
if it actually gets good enough at some
 

4389
01:12:17,440 --> 01:12:19,030
if it actually gets good enough at some
point that it starts catching on it

4390
01:12:19,030 --> 01:12:19,040
point that it starts catching on it
 

4391
01:12:19,040 --> 01:12:19,430
point that it starts catching on it
could

4392
01:12:19,430 --> 01:12:19,440
could
 

4393
01:12:19,440 --> 01:12:22,950
could
scale and if other people carbon copy it

4394
01:12:22,950 --> 01:12:22,960
scale and if other people carbon copy it
 

4395
01:12:22,960 --> 01:12:25,030
scale and if other people carbon copy it
and make other versions that are better

4396
01:12:25,030 --> 01:12:25,040
and make other versions that are better
 

4397
01:12:25,040 --> 01:12:28,229

that's the more the merrier

4398
01:12:28,229 --> 01:12:28,239
that's the more the merrier
 

4399
01:12:28,239 --> 01:12:31,270
that's the more the merrier
i think there's a real

01:12:31,270 --> 01:12:31,280
i think there's a real
 

4401
01:12:31,280 --> 01:12:33,030
i think there's a real
opportunity for machine learning to

4402
01:12:33,030 --> 01:12:33,040
opportunity for machine learning to
 

4403
01:12:33,040 --> 01:12:35,750
opportunity for machine learning to
empower the individual

4404
01:12:35,750 --> 01:12:35,760
empower the individual
 

4405
01:12:35,760 --> 01:12:39,270
empower the individual
the list of the powerful players

4406
01:12:39,270 --> 01:12:39,280
the list of the powerful players
 

4407
01:12:39,280 --> 01:12:41,270
the list of the powerful players
uh it's as i said in the beginning here

4408
01:12:41,270 --> 01:12:41,280
uh it's as i said in the beginning here
 

4409
01:12:41,280 --> 01:12:42,790
uh it's as i said in the beginning here
it's been mostly the other way around so

4410
01:12:42,790 --> 01:12:42,800
it's been mostly the other way around so
 

4411
01:12:42,800 --> 01:12:44,790
it's been mostly the other way around so
far that the big players have the ai

4412
01:12:44,790 --> 01:12:44,800
far that the big players have the ai
 

4413
01:12:44,800 --> 01:12:47,350
far that the big players have the ai
and then they tell people this is the

4414
01:12:47,350 --> 01:12:47,360
and then they tell people this is the
 

4415
01:12:47,360 --> 01:12:47,990
and then they tell people this is the
truth

4416
01:12:47,990 --> 01:12:48,000
truth
 

4417
01:12:48,000 --> 01:12:50,470
truth
this is how it is but it can just as

4418
01:12:50,470 --> 01:12:50,480
this is how it is but it can just as
 

4419
01:12:50,480 --> 01:12:51,110
this is how it is but it can just as
well

4420
01:12:51,110 --> 01:12:51,120
well
 

4421
01:12:51,120 --> 01:12:52,550
well
go the other way around and when the

4422
01:12:52,550 --> 01:12:52,560
go the other way around and when the
 

4423
01:12:52,560 --> 01:12:53,990
go the other way around and when the
internet was born actually a lot of

4424
01:12:53,990 --> 01:12:54,000
internet was born actually a lot of
 

4425
01:12:54,000 --> 01:12:55,350
internet was born actually a lot of
people had this hope that maybe this

4426
01:12:55,350 --> 01:12:55,360
people had this hope that maybe this
 

4427
01:12:55,360 --> 01:12:55,990
people had this hope that maybe this
will

4428
01:12:55,990 --> 01:12:56,000
will
 

4429
01:12:56,000 --> 01:12:57,750
will
be a great thing for democracy make it

4430
01:12:57,750 --> 01:12:57,760
be a great thing for democracy make it
 

4431
01:12:57,760 --> 01:12:59,430
be a great thing for democracy make it
easier to find out about things

4432
01:12:59,430 --> 01:12:59,440
easier to find out about things
 

4433
01:12:59,440 --> 01:13:00,709
easier to find out about things
and maybe machine learning and things

4434
01:13:00,709 --> 01:13:00,719
and maybe machine learning and things
 

4435
01:13:00,719 --> 01:13:02,630
and maybe machine learning and things
like this can uh can

4436
01:13:02,630 --> 01:13:02,640
like this can uh can
 

4437
01:13:02,640 --> 01:13:04,390
like this can uh can
actually help again and i have to say i

4438
01:13:04,390 --> 01:13:04,400
actually help again and i have to say i
 

4439
01:13:04,400 --> 01:13:06,070
actually help again and i have to say i
think it's impo it's more important than

4440
01:13:06,070 --> 01:13:06,080
think it's impo it's more important than
 

4441
01:13:06,080 --> 01:13:06,470
think it's impo it's more important than
ever

4442
01:13:06,470 --> 01:13:06,480
ever
 

4443
01:13:06,480 --> 01:13:09,270
ever
now right because this is very linked

4444
01:13:09,270 --> 01:13:09,280
now right because this is very linked
 

4445
01:13:09,280 --> 01:13:10,149
now right because this is very linked
also to the whole

4446
01:13:10,149 --> 01:13:10,159
also to the whole
 

4447
01:13:10,159 --> 01:13:13,590
also to the whole
future of life as we discussed earlier

4448
01:13:13,590 --> 01:13:13,600
future of life as we discussed earlier
 

4449
01:13:13,600 --> 01:13:14,790
future of life as we discussed earlier
right we're getting this ever more

4450
01:13:14,790 --> 01:13:14,800
right we're getting this ever more
 

4451
01:13:14,800 --> 01:13:16,870
right we're getting this ever more
powerful attack you know

4452
01:13:16,870 --> 01:13:16,880
powerful attack you know
 

4453
01:13:16,880 --> 01:13:18,950
powerful attack you know
it's frank it's pretty clear if you look

4454
01:13:18,950 --> 01:13:18,960
it's frank it's pretty clear if you look
 

4455
01:13:18,960 --> 01:13:20,870
it's frank it's pretty clear if you look
on the one or two generation three

4456
01:13:20,870 --> 01:13:20,880
on the one or two generation three
 

4457
01:13:20,880 --> 01:13:22,229
on the one or two generation three
generation time scale that there are

4458
01:13:22,229 --> 01:13:22,239
generation time scale that there are
 

4459
01:13:22,239 --> 01:13:23,590
generation time scale that there are
only two ways this can end

4460
01:13:23,590 --> 01:13:23,600
only two ways this can end
 

4461
01:13:23,600 --> 01:13:25,910
only two ways this can end
geopolitically yeah either it ends great

4462
01:13:25,910 --> 01:13:25,920
geopolitically yeah either it ends great
 

4463
01:13:25,920 --> 01:13:27,590
geopolitically yeah either it ends great
for all humanity

4464
01:13:27,590 --> 01:13:27,600
for all humanity
 

4465
01:13:27,600 --> 01:13:31,510
for all humanity
or ends terribly for all of us

4466
01:13:31,510 --> 01:13:31,520
or ends terribly for all of us
 

4467
01:13:31,520 --> 01:13:33,669
or ends terribly for all of us
there's there's really no in between it

4468
01:13:33,669 --> 01:13:33,679
there's there's really no in between it
 

4469
01:13:33,679 --> 01:13:34,790
there's there's really no in between it
and

4470
01:13:34,790 --> 01:13:34,800
and
 

4471
01:13:34,800 --> 01:13:36,950
and
we're so stuck in and because you know

4472
01:13:36,950 --> 01:13:36,960
we're so stuck in and because you know
 

4473
01:13:36,960 --> 01:13:39,110
we're so stuck in and because you know
technology knows no borders

4474
01:13:39,110 --> 01:13:39,120
technology knows no borders
 

4475
01:13:39,120 --> 01:13:42,149
technology knows no borders
and you can't have people fighting

4476
01:13:42,149 --> 01:13:42,159
and you can't have people fighting
 

4477
01:13:42,159 --> 01:13:44,229
and you can't have people fighting
when the weapons just keep getting ever

4478
01:13:44,229 --> 01:13:44,239
when the weapons just keep getting ever
 

4479
01:13:44,239 --> 01:13:45,510
when the weapons just keep getting ever
more powerful

4480
01:13:45,510 --> 01:13:45,520
more powerful
 

4481
01:13:45,520 --> 01:13:48,630
more powerful
uh indefinitely eventually

4482
01:13:48,630 --> 01:13:48,640
uh indefinitely eventually
 

4483
01:13:48,640 --> 01:13:52,149
uh indefinitely eventually
lux the luck runs out and and you know

4484
01:13:52,149 --> 01:13:52,159
lux the luck runs out and and you know
 

4485
01:13:52,159 --> 01:13:54,229
lux the luck runs out and and you know
right like right now we have i love

4486
01:13:54,229 --> 01:13:54,239
right like right now we have i love
 

4487
01:13:54,239 --> 01:13:55,510
right like right now we have i love
america

4488
01:13:55,510 --> 01:13:55,520
america
 

4489
01:13:55,520 --> 01:13:58,709
america
but the the fact of the matter is

4490
01:13:58,709 --> 01:13:58,719
but the the fact of the matter is
 

4491
01:13:58,719 --> 01:14:00,870
but the the fact of the matter is
what's good for america is not opposites

4492
01:14:00,870 --> 01:14:00,880
what's good for america is not opposites
 

4493
01:14:00,880 --> 01:14:02,630
what's good for america is not opposites
in the long term to what's good for

4494
01:14:02,630 --> 01:14:02,640
in the long term to what's good for
 

4495
01:14:02,640 --> 01:14:05,430
in the long term to what's good for
other countries it it would be if this

4496
01:14:05,430 --> 01:14:05,440
other countries it it would be if this
 

4497
01:14:05,440 --> 01:14:06,149
other countries it it would be if this
was some sort of

4498
01:14:06,149 --> 01:14:06,159
was some sort of
 

4499
01:14:06,159 --> 01:14:09,350
was some sort of
zero-sum game like it was thousands of

4500
01:14:09,350 --> 01:14:09,360
zero-sum game like it was thousands of
 

4501
01:14:09,360 --> 01:14:11,110
zero-sum game like it was thousands of
years ago when the only way one country

4502
01:14:11,110 --> 01:14:11,120
years ago when the only way one country
 

4503
01:14:11,120 --> 01:14:13,110
years ago when the only way one country
could get more resources

4504
01:14:13,110 --> 01:14:13,120
could get more resources
 

4505
01:14:13,120 --> 01:14:14,870
could get more resources
was to take land from other countries

4506
01:14:14,870 --> 01:14:14,880
was to take land from other countries
 

4507
01:14:14,880 --> 01:14:16,950
was to take land from other countries
because that was basically the resource

4508
01:14:16,950 --> 01:14:16,960
because that was basically the resource
 

4509
01:14:16,960 --> 01:14:18,950
because that was basically the resource
right you look at the map of europe some

4510
01:14:18,950 --> 01:14:18,960
right you look at the map of europe some
 

4511
01:14:18,960 --> 01:14:20,149
right you look at the map of europe some
countries kept getting bigger and

4512
01:14:20,149 --> 01:14:20,159
countries kept getting bigger and
 

4513
01:14:20,159 --> 01:14:21,270
countries kept getting bigger and
smaller

4514
01:14:21,270 --> 01:14:21,280
smaller
 

4515
01:14:21,280 --> 01:14:24,390
smaller
endless wars but then since

4516
01:14:24,390 --> 01:14:24,400
endless wars but then since
 

4517
01:14:24,400 --> 01:14:26,390
endless wars but then since
1945 there hasn't been any war in

4518
01:14:26,390 --> 01:14:26,400
1945 there hasn't been any war in
 

4519
01:14:26,400 --> 01:14:27,990
1945 there hasn't been any war in
western europe and they all got way

4520
01:14:27,990 --> 01:14:28,000
western europe and they all got way
 

4521
01:14:28,000 --> 01:14:31,430
western europe and they all got way
richer because of tech so the optimistic

4522
01:14:31,430 --> 01:14:31,440
richer because of tech so the optimistic
 

4523
01:14:31,440 --> 01:14:32,229
richer because of tech so the optimistic
outcome is

4524
01:14:32,229 --> 01:14:32,239
outcome is
 

4525
01:14:32,239 --> 01:14:35,750
outcome is
that the big winner in this century is

4526
01:14:35,750 --> 01:14:35,760
that the big winner in this century is
 

4527
01:14:35,760 --> 01:14:37,430
that the big winner in this century is
going to be america and china

4528
01:14:37,430 --> 01:14:37,440
going to be america and china
 

4529
01:14:37,440 --> 01:14:39,270
going to be america and china
and russia and everybody else because

4530
01:14:39,270 --> 01:14:39,280
and russia and everybody else because
 

4531
01:14:39,280 --> 01:14:40,790
and russia and everybody else because
technology just makes us all

4532
01:14:40,790 --> 01:14:40,800
technology just makes us all
 

4533
01:14:40,800 --> 01:14:42,470
technology just makes us all
healthier and wealthier and we just find

4534
01:14:42,470 --> 01:14:42,480
healthier and wealthier and we just find
 

4535
01:14:42,480 --> 01:14:43,830
healthier and wealthier and we just find
some way of

4536
01:14:43,830 --> 01:14:43,840
some way of
 

4537
01:14:43,840 --> 01:14:47,110
some way of
keeping the peace on this planet but i

4538
01:14:47,110 --> 01:14:47,120
keeping the peace on this planet but i
 

4539
01:14:47,120 --> 01:14:47,590
keeping the peace on this planet but i
think

4540
01:14:47,590 --> 01:14:47,600
think
 

4541
01:14:47,600 --> 01:14:49,270
think
unfortunately there are some pretty

4542
01:14:49,270 --> 01:14:49,280
unfortunately there are some pretty
 

4543
01:14:49,280 --> 01:14:50,950
unfortunately there are some pretty
powerful forces right now that are

4544
01:14:50,950 --> 01:14:50,960
powerful forces right now that are
 

4545
01:14:50,960 --> 01:14:52,149
powerful forces right now that are
pushing in exactly the opposite

4546
01:14:52,149 --> 01:14:52,159
pushing in exactly the opposite
 

4547
01:14:52,159 --> 01:14:53,590
pushing in exactly the opposite
direction and trying to demonize other

4548
01:14:53,590 --> 01:14:53,600
direction and trying to demonize other
 

4549
01:14:53,600 --> 01:14:54,470
direction and trying to demonize other
countries

4550
01:14:54,470 --> 01:14:54,480
countries
 

4551
01:14:54,480 --> 01:14:56,470
countries
which just makes it more likely that

4552
01:14:56,470 --> 01:14:56,480
which just makes it more likely that
 

4553
01:14:56,480 --> 01:14:57,910
which just makes it more likely that
this ever more powerful tech

4554
01:14:57,910 --> 01:14:57,920
this ever more powerful tech
 

4555
01:14:57,920 --> 01:15:01,669
this ever more powerful tech
we're building is gonna use disastrous

4556
01:15:01,669 --> 01:15:01,679
we're building is gonna use disastrous
 

4557
01:15:01,679 --> 01:15:02,149
we're building is gonna use disastrous
ways

4558
01:15:02,149 --> 01:15:02,159
ways
 

4559
01:15:02,159 --> 01:15:04,390
ways
yeah for aggression versus cooperation

4560
01:15:04,390 --> 01:15:04,400
yeah for aggression versus cooperation
 

4561
01:15:04,400 --> 01:15:05,669
yeah for aggression versus cooperation
that kind of thing yeah even look at

4562
01:15:05,669 --> 01:15:05,679
that kind of thing yeah even look at
 

4563
01:15:05,679 --> 01:15:07,910
that kind of thing yeah even look at
look at this military ai now right

4564
01:15:07,910 --> 01:15:07,920
look at this military ai now right
 

4565
01:15:07,920 --> 01:15:11,189
look at this military ai now right
it's 120 it was so awesome to see these

4566
01:15:11,189 --> 01:15:11,199
it's 120 it was so awesome to see these
 

4567
01:15:11,199 --> 01:15:12,870
it's 120 it was so awesome to see these
dancing robots i loved it

4568
01:15:12,870 --> 01:15:12,880
dancing robots i loved it
 

4569
01:15:12,880 --> 01:15:16,149
dancing robots i loved it
right but one of the biggest growth

4570
01:15:16,149 --> 01:15:16,159
right but one of the biggest growth
 

4571
01:15:16,159 --> 01:15:17,350
right but one of the biggest growth
areas in robotics now

4572
01:15:17,350 --> 01:15:17,360
areas in robotics now
 

4573
01:15:17,360 --> 01:15:19,350
areas in robotics now
is of course autonomous weapons right

4574
01:15:19,350 --> 01:15:19,360
is of course autonomous weapons right
 

4575
01:15:19,360 --> 01:15:21,350
is of course autonomous weapons right
and and 2020 was like the

4576
01:15:21,350 --> 01:15:21,360
and and 2020 was like the
 

4577
01:15:21,360 --> 01:15:23,910
and and 2020 was like the
best marketing year ever for autonomous

4578
01:15:23,910 --> 01:15:23,920
best marketing year ever for autonomous
 

4579
01:15:23,920 --> 01:15:25,030
best marketing year ever for autonomous
weapons because

4580
01:15:25,030 --> 01:15:25,040
weapons because
 

4581
01:15:25,040 --> 01:15:28,270
weapons because
in both libya civil war and in

4582
01:15:28,270 --> 01:15:28,280
in both libya civil war and in
 

4583
01:15:28,280 --> 01:15:31,030
in both libya civil war and in
nagorno-karabakh

4584
01:15:31,030 --> 01:15:31,040
nagorno-karabakh
 

4585
01:15:31,040 --> 01:15:34,390
nagorno-karabakh
they made the decisive difference right

4586
01:15:34,390 --> 01:15:34,400
they made the decisive difference right
 

4587
01:15:34,400 --> 01:15:36,149
they made the decisive difference right
and everybody else is like watching this

4588
01:15:36,149 --> 01:15:36,159
and everybody else is like watching this
 

4589
01:15:36,159 --> 01:15:37,590
and everybody else is like watching this
oh yeah we want to build autonomous

4590
01:15:37,590 --> 01:15:37,600
oh yeah we want to build autonomous
 

4591
01:15:37,600 --> 01:15:37,990
oh yeah we want to build autonomous
weapons

4592
01:15:37,990 --> 01:15:38,000
weapons
 

4593
01:15:38,000 --> 01:15:42,070
weapons
too and in libya

4594
01:15:42,070 --> 01:15:42,080

 

4595
01:15:42,080 --> 01:15:45,590

you had on one hand our ally the united

4596
01:15:45,590 --> 01:15:45,600
you had on one hand our ally the united
 

4597
01:15:45,600 --> 01:15:47,510
you had on one hand our ally the united
arab emirates that were flying their

4598
01:15:47,510 --> 01:15:47,520
arab emirates that were flying their
 

4599
01:15:47,520 --> 01:15:48,950
arab emirates that were flying their
autonomous weapons that they bought from

4600
01:15:48,950 --> 01:15:48,960
autonomous weapons that they bought from
 

4601
01:15:48,960 --> 01:15:50,630
autonomous weapons that they bought from
china

4602
01:15:50,630 --> 01:15:50,640
china
 

4603
01:15:50,640 --> 01:15:52,630
china
bombing libyans and on the other side

4604
01:15:52,630 --> 01:15:52,640
bombing libyans and on the other side
 

4605
01:15:52,640 --> 01:15:54,550
bombing libyans and on the other side
you had our other ally turkey flying

4606
01:15:54,550 --> 01:15:54,560
you had our other ally turkey flying
 

4607
01:15:54,560 --> 01:15:55,350
you had our other ally turkey flying
their

4608
01:15:55,350 --> 01:15:55,360
their
 

4609
01:15:55,360 --> 01:15:58,950
their
drones and

4610
01:15:58,950 --> 01:15:58,960
drones and
 

4611
01:15:58,960 --> 01:16:00,550
drones and
they had no skin in the game any of

4612
01:16:00,550 --> 01:16:00,560
they had no skin in the game any of
 

4613
01:16:00,560 --> 01:16:02,149
they had no skin in the game any of
these other countries and of course

4614
01:16:02,149 --> 01:16:02,159
these other countries and of course
 

4615
01:16:02,159 --> 01:16:03,510
these other countries and of course
there was the libyans who really got

4616
01:16:03,510 --> 01:16:03,520
there was the libyans who really got
 

4617
01:16:03,520 --> 01:16:04,149
there was the libyans who really got
screwed

4618
01:16:04,149 --> 01:16:04,159
screwed
 

4619
01:16:04,159 --> 01:16:07,990
screwed
in nagorno-karabakh you had actually

4620
01:16:07,990 --> 01:16:08,000
in nagorno-karabakh you had actually
 

4621
01:16:08,000 --> 01:16:11,270
in nagorno-karabakh you had actually
again now turkey is sending drones built

4622
01:16:11,270 --> 01:16:11,280
again now turkey is sending drones built
 

4623
01:16:11,280 --> 01:16:13,910
again now turkey is sending drones built
by this company that was actually

4624
01:16:13,910 --> 01:16:13,920
by this company that was actually
 

4625
01:16:13,920 --> 01:16:16,229
by this company that was actually
founded by a guy who went to mit

4626
01:16:16,229 --> 01:16:16,239
founded by a guy who went to mit
 

4627
01:16:16,239 --> 01:16:17,910
founded by a guy who went to mit
aeroastro do you know that

4628
01:16:17,910 --> 01:16:17,920
aeroastro do you know that
 

4629
01:16:17,920 --> 01:16:20,709
aeroastro do you know that
background dr yeah so mit has a direct

4630
01:16:20,709 --> 01:16:20,719
background dr yeah so mit has a direct
 

4631
01:16:20,719 --> 01:16:21,910
background dr yeah so mit has a direct
responsibility for

4632
01:16:21,910 --> 01:16:21,920
responsibility for
 

4633
01:16:21,920 --> 01:16:23,350
responsibility for
ultimately this and a lot of civilians

4634
01:16:23,350 --> 01:16:23,360
ultimately this and a lot of civilians
 

4635
01:16:23,360 --> 01:16:25,590
ultimately this and a lot of civilians
were killed there you know and

4636
01:16:25,590 --> 01:16:25,600
were killed there you know and
 

4637
01:16:25,600 --> 01:16:27,590
were killed there you know and
so because it was militarily so

4638
01:16:27,590 --> 01:16:27,600
so because it was militarily so
 

4639
01:16:27,600 --> 01:16:29,189
so because it was militarily so
effective

4640
01:16:29,189 --> 01:16:29,199
effective
 

4641
01:16:29,199 --> 01:16:31,189
effective
now now suddenly there's a huge push oh

4642
01:16:31,189 --> 01:16:31,199
now now suddenly there's a huge push oh
 

4643
01:16:31,199 --> 01:16:32,310
now now suddenly there's a huge push oh
yeah yeah let's

4644
01:16:32,310 --> 01:16:32,320
yeah yeah let's
 

4645
01:16:32,320 --> 01:16:35,669
yeah yeah let's
go build ever more autonomy

4646
01:16:35,669 --> 01:16:35,679
go build ever more autonomy
 

4647
01:16:35,679 --> 01:16:37,990
go build ever more autonomy
into these these weapons and it's going

4648
01:16:37,990 --> 01:16:38,000
into these these weapons and it's going
 

4649
01:16:38,000 --> 01:16:39,510
into these these weapons and it's going
to be great

4650
01:16:39,510 --> 01:16:39,520
to be great
 

4651
01:16:39,520 --> 01:16:44,070
to be great
and uh i think actually

4652
01:16:44,070 --> 01:16:44,080
and uh i think actually
 

4653
01:16:44,080 --> 01:16:45,669
and uh i think actually
people who are obsessed about some sort

4654
01:16:45,669 --> 01:16:45,679
people who are obsessed about some sort
 

4655
01:16:45,679 --> 01:16:47,990
people who are obsessed about some sort
of future terminology scenario right now

4656
01:16:47,990 --> 01:16:48,000
of future terminology scenario right now
 

4657
01:16:48,000 --> 01:16:49,030
of future terminology scenario right now
or

4658
01:16:49,030 --> 01:16:49,040
or
 

4659
01:16:49,040 --> 01:16:51,590
or
should start focusing on the fact that

4660
01:16:51,590 --> 01:16:51,600
should start focusing on the fact that
 

4661
01:16:51,600 --> 01:16:52,310
should start focusing on the fact that
we have

4662
01:16:52,310 --> 01:16:52,320
we have
 

4663
01:16:52,320 --> 01:16:54,149
we have
two much more urgent threats happening

4664
01:16:54,149 --> 01:16:54,159
two much more urgent threats happening
 

4665
01:16:54,159 --> 01:16:55,510
two much more urgent threats happening
for machine learning one of them is the

4666
01:16:55,510 --> 01:16:55,520
for machine learning one of them is the
 

4667
01:16:55,520 --> 01:16:56,470
for machine learning one of them is the
whole

4668
01:16:56,470 --> 01:16:56,480
whole
 

4669
01:16:56,480 --> 01:16:57,990
whole
destruction of democracy that we've

4670
01:16:57,990 --> 01:16:58,000
destruction of democracy that we've
 

4671
01:16:58,000 --> 01:16:59,830
destruction of democracy that we've
talked about now where

4672
01:16:59,830 --> 01:16:59,840
talked about now where
 

4673
01:16:59,840 --> 01:17:02,790
talked about now where
where our flow of information is being

4674
01:17:02,790 --> 01:17:02,800
where our flow of information is being
 

4675
01:17:02,800 --> 01:17:04,470
where our flow of information is being
manipulated by machine learning and the

4676
01:17:04,470 --> 01:17:04,480
manipulated by machine learning and the
 

4677
01:17:04,480 --> 01:17:05,590
manipulated by machine learning and the
other one is

4678
01:17:05,590 --> 01:17:05,600
other one is
 

4679
01:17:05,600 --> 01:17:07,669
other one is
that right now you know this is the year

4680
01:17:07,669 --> 01:17:07,679
that right now you know this is the year
 

4681
01:17:07,679 --> 01:17:09,030
that right now you know this is the year
when the big arms race

4682
01:17:09,030 --> 01:17:09,040
when the big arms race
 

4683
01:17:09,040 --> 01:17:11,430
when the big arms race
in out of control arms race and at least

4684
01:17:11,430 --> 01:17:11,440
in out of control arms race and at least
 

4685
01:17:11,440 --> 01:17:13,270
in out of control arms race and at least
thomas weapons is going to start or

4686
01:17:13,270 --> 01:17:13,280
thomas weapons is going to start or
 

4687
01:17:13,280 --> 01:17:15,430
thomas weapons is going to start or
it's going to stop so you have a sense

4688
01:17:15,430 --> 01:17:15,440
it's going to stop so you have a sense
 

4689
01:17:15,440 --> 01:17:17,270
it's going to stop so you have a sense
that there is uh

4690
01:17:17,270 --> 01:17:17,280
that there is uh
 

4691
01:17:17,280 --> 01:17:20,550
that there is uh
like 2020 was a instrumental catalyst

4692
01:17:20,550 --> 01:17:20,560
like 2020 was a instrumental catalyst
 

4693
01:17:20,560 --> 01:17:21,669
like 2020 was a instrumental catalyst
for the race

4694
01:17:21,669 --> 01:17:21,679
for the race
 

4695
01:17:21,679 --> 01:17:24,310
for the race
of for the autonomous weapons race yeah

4696
01:17:24,310 --> 01:17:24,320
of for the autonomous weapons race yeah
 

4697
01:17:24,320 --> 01:17:25,669
of for the autonomous weapons race yeah
because it was the first year when

4698
01:17:25,669 --> 01:17:25,679
because it was the first year when
 

4699
01:17:25,679 --> 01:17:27,030
because it was the first year when
when they proved decisive in the

4700
01:17:27,030 --> 01:17:27,040
when they proved decisive in the
 

4701
01:17:27,040 --> 01:17:28,709
when they proved decisive in the
battlefield and

4702
01:17:28,709 --> 01:17:28,719
battlefield and
 

4703
01:17:28,719 --> 01:17:30,390
battlefield and
and these ones are still not fully

4704
01:17:30,390 --> 01:17:30,400
and these ones are still not fully
 

4705
01:17:30,400 --> 01:17:31,669
and these ones are still not fully
autonomous mostly they're remote

4706
01:17:31,669 --> 01:17:31,679
autonomous mostly they're remote
 

4707
01:17:31,679 --> 01:17:32,550
autonomous mostly they're remote
controlled right

4708
01:17:32,550 --> 01:17:32,560
controlled right
 

4709
01:17:32,560 --> 01:17:35,990
controlled right
but you know we could

4710
01:17:35,990 --> 01:17:36,000
but you know we could
 

4711
01:17:36,000 --> 01:17:39,110
but you know we could
very quickly make things about you know

4712
01:17:39,110 --> 01:17:39,120
very quickly make things about you know
 

4713
01:17:39,120 --> 01:17:41,669
very quickly make things about you know
the size and cost of a smartphone

4714
01:17:41,669 --> 01:17:41,679
the size and cost of a smartphone
 

4715
01:17:41,679 --> 01:17:43,750
the size and cost of a smartphone
which you just put in the gps

4716
01:17:43,750 --> 01:17:43,760
which you just put in the gps
 

4717
01:17:43,760 --> 01:17:45,110
which you just put in the gps
coordinates or the face of the one you

4718
01:17:45,110 --> 01:17:45,120
coordinates or the face of the one you
 

4719
01:17:45,120 --> 01:17:46,870
coordinates or the face of the one you
want to kill his skin color or whatever

4720
01:17:46,870 --> 01:17:46,880
want to kill his skin color or whatever
 

4721
01:17:46,880 --> 01:17:48,390
want to kill his skin color or whatever
and it flies away and you know does it

4722
01:17:48,390 --> 01:17:48,400
and it flies away and you know does it
 

4723
01:17:48,400 --> 01:17:50,149
and it flies away and you know does it
and

4724
01:17:50,149 --> 01:17:50,159
and
 

4725

01:20:28,790 --> 01:20:28,800
that drones is the remote operation
 

4887
01:20:28,800 --> 01:20:29,510
that drones is the remote operation
which they are

4888
01:20:29,510 --> 01:20:29,520
which they are
 

4889
01:20:29,520 --> 01:20:32,070
which they are
mostly yes but you're not taking the

4890
01:20:32,070 --> 01:20:32,080
mostly yes but you're not taking the
 

4891
01:20:32,080 --> 01:20:32,870
mostly yes but you're not taking the
next

4892
01:20:32,870 --> 01:20:32,880
next
 

4893
01:20:32,880 --> 01:20:35,430
next
intellectual step of like where does

4894
01:20:35,430 --> 01:20:35,440
intellectual step of like where does
 

4895
01:20:35,440 --> 01:20:36,149
intellectual step of like where does
this go

4896
01:20:36,149 --> 01:20:36,159
this go
 

4897
01:20:36,159 --> 01:20:37,669
this go
you're kind of saying the problem with

4898
01:20:37,669 --> 01:20:37,679
you're kind of saying the problem with
 

4899
01:20:37,679 --> 01:20:40,310
you're kind of saying the problem with
drones is that you're removing yourself

4900
01:20:40,310 --> 01:20:40,320
drones is that you're removing yourself
 

4901
01:20:40,320 --> 01:20:41,110
drones is that you're removing yourself
from

4902
01:20:41,110 --> 01:20:41,120
from
 

4903
01:20:41,120 --> 01:20:43,189
from
direct violence therefore you're not

4904
01:20:43,189 --> 01:20:43,199
direct violence therefore you're not
 

4905
01:20:43,199 --> 01:20:45,270
direct violence therefore you're not
able to sort of maintain the common

4906
01:20:45,270 --> 01:20:45,280
able to sort of maintain the common
 

4907
01:20:45,280 --> 01:20:47,110
able to sort of maintain the common
humanity required to make the proper

4908
01:20:47,110 --> 01:20:47,120
humanity required to make the proper
 

4909
01:20:47,120 --> 01:20:48,550
humanity required to make the proper
decision strategically

4910
01:20:48,550 --> 01:20:48,560
decision strategically
 

4911
01:20:48,560 --> 01:20:50,229
decision strategically
but that's the criticism as opposed to

4912
01:20:50,229 --> 01:20:50,239
but that's the criticism as opposed to
 

4913
01:20:50,239 --> 01:20:51,910
but that's the criticism as opposed to
like if this is

4914
01:20:51,910 --> 01:20:51,920
like if this is
 

4915
01:20:51,920 --> 01:20:55,430
like if this is
automated and just exactly as you said

4916
01:20:55,430 --> 01:20:55,440
automated and just exactly as you said
 

4917
01:20:55,440 --> 01:20:58,470
automated and just exactly as you said
if you automate it and there's a race

4918
01:20:58,470 --> 01:20:58,480
if you automate it and there's a race
 

4919
01:20:58,480 --> 01:20:59,990
if you automate it and there's a race
then he's going to the technology and

4920
01:20:59,990 --> 01:21:00,000
then he's going to the technology and
 

4921
01:21:00,000 --> 01:21:01,189
then he's going to the technology and
you get better and better and better

4922
01:21:01,189 --> 01:21:01,199
you get better and better and better
 

4923
01:21:01,199 --> 01:21:02,629
you get better and better and better
which means getting cheaper and cheaper

4924
01:21:02,629 --> 01:21:02,639
which means getting cheaper and cheaper
 

4925
01:21:02,639 --> 01:21:03,669
which means getting cheaper and cheaper
and cheaper yeah

4926
01:21:03,669 --> 01:21:03,679
and cheaper yeah
 

4927
01:21:03,679 --> 01:21:06,229
and cheaper yeah
and unlike perhaps nuclear weapons which

4928
01:21:06,229 --> 01:21:06,239
and unlike perhaps nuclear weapons which
 

4929
01:21:06,239 --> 01:21:08,070
and unlike perhaps nuclear weapons which
is connected to

4930
01:21:08,070 --> 01:21:08,080
is connected to
 

4931
01:21:08,080 --> 01:21:10,950
is connected to
uh resources in a way like it's hard to

4932
01:21:10,950 --> 01:21:10,960
uh resources in a way like it's hard to
 

4933
01:21:10,960 --> 01:21:11,750
uh resources in a way like it's hard to
get the

4934
01:21:11,750 --> 01:21:11,760
get the
 

4935
01:21:11,760 --> 01:21:14,790
get the
it's hard to engineer yeah it feels like

4936
01:21:14,790 --> 01:21:14,800
it's hard to engineer yeah it feels like
 

4937
01:21:14,800 --> 01:21:17,030
it's hard to engineer yeah it feels like
it's you know um there's too much

4938
01:21:17,030 --> 01:21:17,040
it's you know um there's too much
 

4939
01:21:17,040 --> 01:21:19,189
it's you know um there's too much
overlap between the tech industry

4940
01:21:19,189 --> 01:21:19,199
overlap between the tech industry
 

4941
01:21:19,199 --> 01:21:20,709
overlap between the tech industry
and autonomous weapons to where you

4942
01:21:20,709 --> 01:21:20,719
and autonomous weapons to where you
 

4943
01:21:20,719 --> 01:21:22,870
and autonomous weapons to where you
could have smartphone type of

4944
01:21:22,870 --> 01:21:22,880
could have smartphone type of
 

4945
01:21:22,880 --> 01:21:26,709
could have smartphone type of
uh cheapness if you look at drones uh

4946
01:21:26,709 --> 01:21:26,719
uh cheapness if you look at drones uh
 

4947
01:21:26,719 --> 01:21:28,470
uh cheapness if you look at drones uh
you know it's a it's a you know for a

4948
01:21:28,470 --> 01:21:28,480
you know it's a it's a you know for a
 

4949
01:21:28,480 --> 01:21:29,669
you know it's a it's a you know for a
thousand dollars you can have an

4950
01:21:29,669 --> 01:21:29,679
thousand dollars you can have an
 

4951
01:21:29,679 --> 01:21:32,070
thousand dollars you can have an
incredible system that's able to

4952
01:21:32,070 --> 01:21:32,080
incredible system that's able to
 

4953
01:21:32,080 --> 01:21:34,629
incredible system that's able to
maintain flight autonomously for you and

4954
01:21:34,629 --> 01:21:34,639
maintain flight autonomously for you and
 

4955
01:21:34,639 --> 01:21:36,390
maintain flight autonomously for you and
take pictures and stuff

4956
01:21:36,390 --> 01:21:36,400
take pictures and stuff
 

4957
01:21:36,400 --> 01:21:37,990
take pictures and stuff
you could see that going into the

4958
01:21:37,990 --> 01:21:38,000
you could see that going into the
 

4959
01:21:38,000 --> 01:21:40,149
you could see that going into the
autonomous weapon space that's

4960
01:21:40,149 --> 01:21:40,159
autonomous weapon space that's
 

4961
01:21:40,159 --> 01:21:42,790
autonomous weapon space that's
um but like why is that not thought

4962
01:21:42,790 --> 01:21:42,800
um but like why is that not thought
 

4963
01:21:42,800 --> 01:21:44,390
um but like why is that not thought
about or discussed enough

4964
01:21:44,390 --> 01:21:44,400
about or discussed enough
 

4965
01:21:44,400 --> 01:21:46,550
about or discussed enough
in the public do you think you see those

4966
01:21:46,550 --> 01:21:46,560
in the public do you think you see those
 

4967
01:21:46,560 --> 01:21:48,870
in the public do you think you see those
dancing boston dynamics robots

4968
01:21:48,870 --> 01:21:48,880
dancing boston dynamics robots
 

4969
01:21:48,880 --> 01:21:52,229
dancing boston dynamics robots
and everybody has this kind of um

4970
01:21:52,229 --> 01:21:52,239
and everybody has this kind of um
 

4971
01:21:52,239 --> 01:21:54,870
and everybody has this kind of um
like as if this is like a far future

4972
01:21:54,870 --> 01:21:54,880
like as if this is like a far future
 

4973
01:21:54,880 --> 01:21:56,070
like as if this is like a far future
yeah they have this like

4974
01:21:56,070 --> 01:21:56,080
yeah they have this like
 

4975
01:21:56,080 --> 01:21:58,709
yeah they have this like
fear like oh this will be terminator in

4976
01:21:58,709 --> 01:21:58,719
fear like oh this will be terminator in
 

4977
01:21:58,719 --> 01:21:59,510
fear like oh this will be terminator in
like some

4978
01:21:59,510 --> 01:21:59,520
like some
 

4979
01:21:59,520 --> 01:22:03,030
like some
i don't know unspecified 20 30 40 years

4980
01:22:03,030 --> 01:22:03,040
i don't know unspecified 20 30 40 years
 

4981
01:22:03,040 --> 01:22:04,709
i don't know unspecified 20 30 40 years
and they don't think about well this is

4982
01:22:04,709 --> 01:22:04,719
and they don't think about well this is
 

4983
01:22:04,719 --> 01:22:06,229
and they don't think about well this is
like some

4984
01:22:06,229 --> 01:22:06,239
like some
 

4985
01:22:06,239 --> 01:22:09,189
like some
much less dramatic version of that is

4986
01:22:09,189 --> 01:22:09,199
much less dramatic version of that is
 

4987
01:22:09,199 --> 01:22:10,470
much less dramatic version of that is
actually happening

4988
01:22:10,470 --> 01:22:10,480
actually happening
 

4989
01:22:10,480 --> 01:22:12,149
actually happening
now it's not going to have it's not

4990
01:22:12,149 --> 01:22:12,159
now it's not going to have it's not
 

4991
01:22:12,159 --> 01:22:13,510
now it's not going to have it's not
going to be legit it's not going to be

4992
01:22:13,510 --> 01:22:13,520
going to be legit it's not going to be

01:22:14,880 --> 01:22:17,110
dancing
but it's this already has the capability

4996
01:22:17,110 --> 01:22:17,120
but it's this already has the capability
 

4997
01:22:17,120 --> 01:22:19,110
but it's this already has the capability
to use artificial intelligence to

4998
01:22:19,110 --> 01:22:19,120
to use artificial intelligence to
 

4999
01:22:19,120 --> 01:22:22,149
to use artificial intelligence to
kill humans yeah the boston dynamics

5000
01:22:22,149 --> 01:22:22,159
kill humans yeah the boston dynamics
 

5001
01:22:22,159 --> 01:22:23,990

leg robots i think the reason we imagine

5002
01:22:23,990 --> 01:22:24,000
leg robots i think the reason we imagine
 

5003
01:22:24,000 --> 01:22:25,510
leg robots i think the reason we imagine
them holding guns is just because you've

5004
01:22:25,510 --> 01:22:25,520
them holding guns is just because you've
 

5005
01:22:25,520 --> 01:22:27,110
them holding guns is just because you've
all seen arnold schwarzenegger right

5006
01:22:27,110 --> 01:22:27,120
all seen arnold schwarzenegger right
 

5007
01:22:27,120 --> 01:22:28,629
all seen arnold schwarzenegger right
right

5008
01:22:28,629 --> 01:22:28,639
right
 

5009
01:22:28,639 --> 01:22:31,270
right
that's our reference point that's pretty

5010
01:22:31,270 --> 01:22:31,280
that's our reference point that's pretty
 

5011
01:22:31,280 --> 01:22:32,629
that's our reference point that's pretty
useless

5012
01:22:32,629 --> 01:22:32,639
useless
 

5013
01:22:32,639 --> 01:22:34,470
useless
that's not going to be the main military

5014
01:22:34,470 --> 01:22:34,480
that's not going to be the main military
 

5015
01:22:34,480 --> 01:22:36,830
that's not going to be the main military
use of them they might be useful in law

5016
01:22:36,830 --> 01:22:36,840
use of them they might be useful in law

5018
01:22:38,070 --> 01:22:38,080
enforcement
 

5019
01:22:38,080 --> 01:22:39,430
enforcement
in the future and then there's a whole

5020
01:22:39,430 --> 01:22:39,440
in the future and then there's a whole
 

5021
01:22:39,440 --> 01:22:41,510
in the future and then there's a whole
debate about do you want robots showing

5022
01:22:41,510 --> 01:22:41,520
debate about do you want robots showing
 

5023
01:22:41,520 --> 01:22:42,950
debate about do you want robots showing
up at your house with guns telling you

5024
01:22:42,950 --> 01:22:42,960
up at your house with guns telling you
 

5025
01:22:42,960 --> 01:22:43,830
up at your house with guns telling you
to

5026
01:22:43,830 --> 01:22:43,840
to
 

5027
01:22:43,840 --> 01:22:45,430
to
uh who'll be perfectly obedient to

5028
01:22:45,430 --> 01:22:45,440
uh who'll be perfectly obedient to
 

5029
01:22:45,440 --> 01:22:47,669
uh who'll be perfectly obedient to
whatever dictator controls whatever

5030
01:22:47,669 --> 01:22:47,679
whatever dictator controls whatever
 

5031
01:22:47,679 --> 01:22:49,110
whatever dictator controls whatever
but let's leave that aside for a moment

5032
01:22:49,110 --> 01:22:49,120
but let's leave that aside for a moment
 

5033
01:22:49,120 --> 01:22:51,270
but let's leave that aside for a moment
and look at what's actually relevant now

5034
01:22:51,270 --> 01:22:51,280
and look at what's actually relevant now
 

5035
01:22:51,280 --> 01:22:54,470
and look at what's actually relevant now
so there's a spectrum of things you can

5036
01:22:54,470 --> 01:22:54,480
so there's a spectrum of things you can
 

5037
01:22:54,480 --> 01:22:56,310
so there's a spectrum of things you can
do with ai in the military and again

5038
01:22:56,310 --> 01:22:56,320
do with ai in the military and again
 

5039
01:22:56,320 --> 01:22:57,990
do with ai in the military and again
to put my card on the table i'm not the

5040
01:22:57,990 --> 01:22:58,000
to put my card on the table i'm not the
 

5041
01:22:58,000 --> 01:22:59,750
to put my card on the table i'm not the
pacifist i think we should

5042
01:22:59,750 --> 01:22:59,760
pacifist i think we should
 

5043
01:22:59,760 --> 01:23:03,430
pacifist i think we should
have good defense um

5044
01:23:03,430 --> 01:23:03,440
have good defense um
 

5045
01:23:03,440 --> 01:23:07,510
have good defense um
so for example a predator drone

5046
01:23:07,510 --> 01:23:07,520
so for example a predator drone
 

5047
01:23:07,520 --> 01:23:09,030
so for example a predator drone
is a room basically a fancy little

5048
01:23:09,030 --> 01:23:09,040
is a room basically a fancy little
 

5049
01:23:09,040 --> 01:23:10,550
is a room basically a fancy little
remote controlled airplane

5050
01:23:10,550 --> 01:23:10,560
remote controlled airplane
 

5051
01:23:10,560 --> 01:23:14,310
remote controlled airplane
right there's a human can piloting it

5052
01:23:14,310 --> 01:23:14,320
right there's a human can piloting it
 

5053
01:23:14,320 --> 01:23:16,149
right there's a human can piloting it
and the decision ultimately about

5054
01:23:16,149 --> 01:23:16,159
and the decision ultimately about
 

5055
01:23:16,159 --> 01:23:17,590
and the decision ultimately about
whether to kill somebody with it is made

5056
01:23:17,590 --> 01:23:17,600
whether to kill somebody with it is made
 

5057
01:23:17,600 --> 01:23:19,350
whether to kill somebody with it is made
by a human still

5058
01:23:19,350 --> 01:23:19,360
by a human still
 

5059
01:23:19,360 --> 01:23:22,950
by a human still
and this is a line i think we should

5060
01:23:22,950 --> 01:23:22,960
and this is a line i think we should
 

5061
01:23:22,960 --> 01:23:23,830
and this is a line i think we should
never cross

5062
01:23:23,830 --> 01:23:23,840
never cross
 

5063
01:23:23,840 --> 01:23:26,390
never cross
there's a current dod policy again you

5064
01:23:26,390 --> 01:23:26,400
there's a current dod policy again you
 

5065
01:23:26,400 --> 01:23:27,830
there's a current dod policy again you
have to have a human in the loop

5066
01:23:27,830 --> 01:23:27,840
have to have a human in the loop
 

5067
01:23:27,840 --> 01:23:30,310
have to have a human in the loop
i think algorithms should never make

5068
01:23:30,310 --> 01:23:30,320
i think algorithms should never make
 

5069
01:23:30,320 --> 01:23:31,830
i think algorithms should never make
life or death decisions they should be

5070
01:23:31,830 --> 01:23:31,840
life or death decisions they should be
 

5071
01:23:31,840 --> 01:23:34,070
life or death decisions they should be
left to humans

5072
01:23:34,070 --> 01:23:34,080
left to humans
 

5073
01:23:34,080 --> 01:23:37,669
left to humans
now why might we cross that line

5074
01:23:37,669 --> 01:23:37,679
now why might we cross that line
 

5075
01:23:37,679 --> 01:23:40,149
now why might we cross that line
well first of all these are expensive

5076
01:23:40,149 --> 01:23:40,159
well first of all these are expensive
 

5077
01:23:40,159 --> 01:23:41,189
well first of all these are expensive
right so

5078
01:23:41,189 --> 01:23:41,199
right so
 

5079
01:23:41,199 --> 01:23:44,709
right so
for example when uh when

5080
01:23:44,709 --> 01:23:44,719
for example when uh when
 

5081
01:23:44,719 --> 01:23:46,550
for example when uh when
when azerbaijan had all these drones and

5082
01:23:46,550 --> 01:23:46,560
when azerbaijan had all these drones and
 

5083
01:23:46,560 --> 01:23:47,990
when azerbaijan had all these drones and
armenia didn't have any they start

5084
01:23:47,990 --> 01:23:48,000
armenia didn't have any they start
 

5085
01:23:48,000 --> 01:23:50,950
armenia didn't have any they start
trying to jerry-rig little cheap things

5086
01:23:50,950 --> 01:23:50,960
trying to jerry-rig little cheap things
 

5087
01:23:50,960 --> 01:23:52,390
trying to jerry-rig little cheap things
fly around and but then of course their

5088
01:23:52,390 --> 01:23:52,400
fly around and but then of course their
 

5089
01:23:52,400 --> 01:23:54,629
fly around and but then of course their
minions would jam them

5090
01:23:54,629 --> 01:23:54,639
minions would jam them
 

5091
01:23:54,639 --> 01:23:56,390
minions would jam them
as areas would jam them and remote

5092
01:23:56,390 --> 01:23:56,400
as areas would jam them and remote
 

5093
01:23:56,400 --> 01:23:58,310
as areas would jam them and remote
control things can be jammed

5094
01:23:58,310 --> 01:23:58,320
control things can be jammed
 

5095
01:23:58,320 --> 01:24:00,470
control things can be jammed
that makes them inferior also there's a

5096
01:24:00,470 --> 01:24:00,480
that makes them inferior also there's a
 

5097
01:24:00,480 --> 01:24:01,830
that makes them inferior also there's a
bit of a time delay

5098
01:24:01,830 --> 01:24:01,840
bit of a time delay
 

5099
01:24:01,840 --> 01:24:04,149
bit of a time delay
between you know if we're piling

5100
01:24:04,149 --> 01:24:04,159
between you know if we're piling
 

5101
01:24:04,159 --> 01:24:06,229
between you know if we're piling
something far away

5102
01:24:06,229 --> 01:24:06,239
something far away
 

5103
01:24:06,239 --> 01:24:08,310
something far away
speed of light and the human has a

5104
01:24:08,310 --> 01:24:08,320
speed of light and the human has a
 

5105
01:24:08,320 --> 01:24:09,510
speed of light and the human has a
reaction time as well

5106
01:24:09,510 --> 01:24:09,520
reaction time as well
 

5107
01:24:09,520 --> 01:24:11,430
reaction time as well
it would be nice to eliminate that

5108
01:24:11,430 --> 01:24:11,440
it would be nice to eliminate that
 

5109
01:24:11,440 --> 01:24:13,110
it would be nice to eliminate that
jamming possibility in the time delay by

5110
01:24:13,110 --> 01:24:13,120
jamming possibility in the time delay by
 

5111
01:24:13,120 --> 01:24:13,750
jamming possibility in the time delay by
having it

5112
01:24:13,750 --> 01:24:13,760
having it
 

5113
01:24:13,760 --> 01:24:16,870
having it
fully autonomous but now you might be so

5114
01:24:16,870 --> 01:24:16,880
fully autonomous but now you might be so
 

5115
01:24:16,880 --> 01:24:17,350
fully autonomous but now you might be so
then

5116
01:24:17,350 --> 01:24:17,360
then
 

5117
01:24:17,360 --> 01:24:19,189
then
if you do but now you might be crossing

5118
01:24:19,189 --> 01:24:19,199
if you do but now you might be crossing
 

5119
01:24:19,199 --> 01:24:21,189
if you do but now you might be crossing
that exact line you might program it to

5120
01:24:21,189 --> 01:24:21,199
that exact line you might program it to
 

5121
01:24:21,199 --> 01:24:21,590
that exact line you might program it to
just

5122
01:24:21,590 --> 01:24:21,600
just
 

5123
01:24:21,600 --> 01:24:24,790
just
oh yeah the air drone go hover over

5124
01:24:24,790 --> 01:24:24,800
oh yeah the air drone go hover over
 

5125
01:24:24,800 --> 01:24:26,950
oh yeah the air drone go hover over
this country for a while and whenever

5126
01:24:26,950 --> 01:24:26,960
this country for a while and whenever
 

5127
01:24:26,960 --> 01:24:28,070
this country for a while and whenever
you find someone who

5128
01:24:28,070 --> 01:24:28,080
you find someone who
 

5129
01:24:28,080 --> 01:24:31,750
you find someone who
is a bad guy you know kill them

5130
01:24:31,750 --> 01:24:31,760
is a bad guy you know kill them
 

5131
01:24:31,760 --> 01:24:33,270
is a bad guy you know kill them
now the machine is making these sort of

5132
01:24:33,270 --> 01:24:33,280
now the machine is making these sort of
 

5133
01:24:33,280 --> 01:24:35,430
now the machine is making these sort of
decisions and you and some people who

5134
01:24:35,430 --> 01:24:35,440
decisions and you and some people who
 

5135
01:24:35,440 --> 01:24:36,070
decisions and you and some people who
defend this

5136
01:24:36,070 --> 01:24:36,080
defend this
 

5137
01:24:36,080 --> 01:24:38,149
defend this
still say well that's morally fine

5138
01:24:38,149 --> 01:24:38,159
still say well that's morally fine
 

5139
01:24:38,159 --> 01:24:40,390
still say well that's morally fine
because we are the good guys

5140
01:24:40,390 --> 01:24:40,400
because we are the good guys
 

5141
01:24:40,400 --> 01:24:42,790
because we are the good guys
and we will tell it the definition of

5142
01:24:42,790 --> 01:24:42,800
and we will tell it the definition of
 

5143
01:24:42,800 --> 01:24:43,990
and we will tell it the definition of
bad guy that we think

5144
01:24:43,990 --> 01:24:44,000
bad guy that we think
 

5145
01:24:44,000 --> 01:24:47,270
bad guy that we think
is moral but now

5146
01:24:47,270 --> 01:24:47,280
is moral but now
 

5147
01:24:47,280 --> 01:24:49,510
is moral but now
you'll be very naive to think that if

5148
01:24:49,510 --> 01:24:49,520
you'll be very naive to think that if
 

5149
01:24:49,520 --> 01:24:50,550
you'll be very naive to think that if

01:24:50,560 --> 01:24:52,470
isis
buys that same drone that they're gonna

01:24:52,470 --> 01:24:52,480
buys that same drone that they're gonna
 

5153
01:24:52,480 --> 01:24:54,470
buys that same drone that they're gonna
use our definition of bad guy

5154
01:24:54,470 --> 01:24:54,480
use our definition of bad guy
 

5155
01:24:54,480 --> 01:24:55,910
use our definition of bad guy
maybe for them bad guy is someone

5156
01:24:55,910 --> 01:24:55,920
maybe for them bad guy is someone
 

5157
01:24:55,920 --> 01:24:58,550
maybe for them bad guy is someone
wearing a us army uniform right

5158
01:24:58,550 --> 01:24:58,560
wearing a us army uniform right
 

5159
01:24:58,560 --> 01:25:04,470
wearing a us army uniform right
or maybe maybe there will be some

5160
01:25:04,470 --> 01:25:04,480

 

5161
01:25:04,480 --> 01:25:07,350

weird uh ethnic group who decides that

5162
01:25:07,350 --> 01:25:07,360
weird uh ethnic group who decides that
 

5163
01:25:07,360 --> 01:25:08,870
weird uh ethnic group who decides that
someone of another ethnic group they are

5164
01:25:08,870 --> 01:25:08,880
someone of another ethnic group they are
 

5165
01:25:08,880 --> 01:25:10,070
someone of another ethnic group they are
the bad guys right

5166
01:25:10,070 --> 01:25:10,080
the bad guys right
 

5167
01:25:10,080 --> 01:25:13,430
the bad guys right
the thing is human soldiers with all

5168
01:25:13,430 --> 01:25:13,440
the thing is human soldiers with all
 

5169
01:25:13,440 --> 01:25:15,270
the thing is human soldiers with all
our faults right we still have some

5170
01:25:15,270 --> 01:25:15,280
our faults right we still have some
 

5171
01:25:15,280 --> 01:25:16,550
our faults right we still have some
basic wiring

5172
01:25:16,550 --> 01:25:16,560
basic wiring
 

5173
01:25:16,560 --> 01:25:19,990
basic wiring
in us like no it's not okay to kill kids

5174
01:25:19,990 --> 01:25:20,000
in us like no it's not okay to kill kids
 

5175
01:25:20,000 --> 01:25:24,310
in us like no it's not okay to kill kids
and civilians and thomas weapon has none

of that
it's just going to do whatever is

this than this to make the holocaust
 

5191
01:25:35,600 --> 01:25:38,629
this than this to make the holocaust
more efficient and he was like

5192
01:25:38,629 --> 01:25:38,639
more efficient and he was like
 

5193
01:25:38,639 --> 01:25:40,790
more efficient and he was like
and off he went and did it right yeah do

5194
01:25:40,790 --> 01:25:40,800
and off he went and did it right yeah do
 

5195
01:25:40,800 --> 01:25:42,709
and off he went and did it right yeah do
we really want to make machines

5196
01:25:42,709 --> 01:25:42,719
we really want to make machines
 

5197
01:25:42,719 --> 01:25:44,310
we really want to make machines
that are like that like completely

5198
01:25:44,310 --> 01:25:44,320
that are like that like completely
 

5199
01:25:44,320 --> 01:25:46,229
that are like that like completely
amoral and we'll take the user's

5200
01:25:46,229 --> 01:25:46,239
amoral and we'll take the user's
 

5201
01:25:46,239 --> 01:25:48,310
amoral and we'll take the user's
definition of who's the bad guy

5202
01:25:48,310 --> 01:25:48,320
definition of who's the bad guy
 

5203
01:25:48,320 --> 01:25:49,669
definition of who's the bad guy
and do we then want to make them so

5204
01:25:49,669 --> 01:25:49,679
and do we then want to make them so
 

5205
01:25:49,679 --> 01:25:52,070
and do we then want to make them so
cheap that all our adversaries can have

5206
01:25:52,070 --> 01:25:52,080

what could possibly go wrong that's the
 

5211
01:25:56,320 --> 01:25:58,629
what could possibly go wrong that's the
that's i think the big argument for why

5212
01:25:58,629 --> 01:25:58,639
that's i think the big argument for why
 

5213
01:25:58,639 --> 01:26:00,390
that's i think the big argument for why
we want to

sort of international agreement
to at least require that these weapons

01:26:18,790 --> 01:26:18,800
to at least require that these weapons
 

5233
01:26:18,800 --> 01:26:20,070
to at least require that these weapons
have to be above a certain

and finally just for your question now
but is it possible to stop it

5244

but is it possible to stop it
 

5245

the bio weapons hero he
 

5255
01:26:45,199 --> 01:26:47,110
the bio weapons hero he
had exactly this criticism also with bio

5256

had exactly this criticism also with bio
 

5257

how can you check for sure that the

01:26:50,000 --> 01:26:52,870
how can you check for sure that the
russians aren't cheating

some people think you have to have
 

5271
01:27:02,239 --> 01:27:04,149
some people think you have to have
inspections and things and you have to

5272
01:27:04,149 --> 01:27:04,159
inspections and things and you have to
 

5273
01:27:04,159 --> 01:27:06,149
inspections and things and you have to
make sure that people that you can catch

5274
01:27:06,149 --> 01:27:06,159
make sure that people that you can catch
 

5275
01:27:06,159 --> 01:27:07,590
make sure that people that you can catch
the cheaters with a hundred percent

5276
01:27:07,590 --> 01:27:07,600
the cheaters with a hundred percent
 

5277
01:27:07,600 --> 01:27:09,910
the cheaters with a hundred percent
chance you don't need a hundred percent

5278
01:27:09,910 --> 01:27:09,920
chance you don't need a hundred percent
 

5279
01:27:09,920 --> 01:27:10,709
chance you don't need a hundred percent
they said

5280
01:27:10,709 --> 01:27:10,719
they said
 

5281
01:27:10,719 --> 01:27:13,990
they said
one percent is usually enough

5282
01:27:13,990 --> 01:27:14,000
one percent is usually enough
 

5283
01:27:14,000 --> 01:27:16,709
one percent is usually enough
because i like if it's just an enemy if

5284
01:27:16,709 --> 01:27:16,719
because i like if it's just an enemy if
 

5285
01:27:16,719 --> 01:27:18,950
because i like if it's just an enemy if
it's another big state

5286
01:27:18,950 --> 01:27:18,960
it's another big state
 

5287
01:27:18,960 --> 01:27:20,790
it's another big state
like suppose china and the u.s have

5288
01:27:20,790 --> 01:27:20,800
like suppose china and the u.s have
 

5289
01:27:20,800 --> 01:27:22,080
like suppose china and the u.s have

these kind of drones are okay but these

5296
01:27:26,390 --> 01:27:26,400
these kind of drones are okay but these
 

5297

these kind of drones are okay but these
fully autonomous ones are not

5298

fully autonomous ones are not
 

5299
01:27:28,639 --> 01:27:31,750
fully autonomous ones are not
now suppose you are

5300
01:27:31,750 --> 01:27:31,760

 

5301
01:27:31,760 --> 01:27:34,310

china and you have cheated and secretly

5302
01:27:34,310 --> 01:27:34,320
china and you have cheated and secretly
 

5303
01:27:34,320 --> 01:27:35,830
china and you have cheated and secretly
developed some clandestine little thing

5304
01:27:35,830 --> 01:27:35,840
developed some clandestine little thing
 

5305
01:27:35,840 --> 01:27:37,189
developed some clandestine little thing
or you're thinking about doing it you

5306
01:27:37,189 --> 01:27:37,199
or you're thinking about doing it you
 

5307
01:27:37,199 --> 01:27:39,110
or you're thinking about doing it you
know what's your calculation that you do

5308
01:27:39,110 --> 01:27:39,120
know what's your calculation that you do
 

5309
01:27:39,120 --> 01:27:40,470
know what's your calculation that you do
well

5310
01:27:40,470 --> 01:27:40,480
well
 

5311
01:27:40,480 --> 01:27:41,750
well
you're like okay what's the probability

5312
01:27:41,750 --> 01:27:41,760
you're like okay what's the probability
 

5313
01:27:41,760 --> 01:27:44,870
you're like okay what's the probability
that we're going to get caught

5314
01:27:44,870 --> 01:27:44,880

 

5315
01:27:44,880 --> 01:27:46,390

if the probability is 100 of course

5316
01:27:46,390 --> 01:27:46,400
if the probability is 100 of course
 

5317
01:27:46,400 --> 01:27:48,870
if the probability is 100 of course
we're not going to do it

5318
01:27:48,870 --> 01:27:48,880
we're not going to do it
 

5319
01:27:48,880 --> 01:27:51,669
we're not going to do it
but if the probability is five percent

5320
01:27:51,669 --> 01:27:51,679
but if the probability is five percent
 

5321
01:27:51,679 --> 01:27:52,870
but if the probability is five percent
that we're going to get caught then it's

5322
01:27:52,870 --> 01:27:52,880
that we're going to get caught then it's
 

5323
01:27:52,880 --> 01:27:54,470
that we're going to get caught then it's
going to be like a huge embarrassment

5324
01:27:54,470 --> 01:27:54,480
going to be like a huge embarrassment
 

5325
01:27:54,480 --> 01:27:55,110
going to be like a huge embarrassment
for us

5326
01:27:55,110 --> 01:27:55,120
for us
 

5327
01:27:55,120 --> 01:27:58,229
for us
yeah and it doesn't have it's

5328
01:27:58,229 --> 01:27:58,239
yeah and it doesn't have it's
 

5329
01:27:58,239 --> 01:28:00,070
yeah and it doesn't have it's
we still have our nuclear weapons anyway

5330
01:28:00,070 --> 01:28:00,080
we still have our nuclear weapons anyway
 

5331
01:28:00,080 --> 01:28:03,189
we still have our nuclear weapons anyway
so it doesn't really

5332
01:28:03,189 --> 01:28:03,199
so it doesn't really
 

5333
01:28:03,199 --> 01:28:04,950
so it doesn't really
make an enormous difference in in terms

5334
01:28:04,950 --> 01:28:04,960
make an enormous difference in in terms
 

5335
01:28:04,960 --> 01:28:06,790
make an enormous difference in in terms
of deterring the u.s

5336
01:28:06,790 --> 01:28:06,800
of deterring the u.s
 

5337
01:28:06,800 --> 01:28:09,270
of deterring the u.s
you know and that fees the stigma that

5338
01:28:09,270 --> 01:28:09,280
you know and that fees the stigma that
 

5339
01:28:09,280 --> 01:28:10,790
you know and that fees the stigma that
you kind of

5340
01:28:10,790 --> 01:28:10,800
you kind of
 

5341
01:28:10,800 --> 01:28:12,629
you kind of
establish like this fabric this

5342
01:28:12,629 --> 01:28:12,639
establish like this fabric this
 

5343
01:28:12,639 --> 01:28:14,790
establish like this fabric this
universal stigma over the thing

5344
01:28:14,790 --> 01:28:14,800
universal stigma over the thing
 

5345
01:28:14,800 --> 01:28:16,470
universal stigma over the thing
exactly it's very reasonable for them to

5346
01:28:16,470 --> 01:28:16,480
exactly it's very reasonable for them to
 

5347
01:28:16,480 --> 01:28:18,310
exactly it's very reasonable for them to
say well you know we probably get away

5348
01:28:18,310 --> 01:28:18,320
say well you know we probably get away
 

5349
01:28:18,320 --> 01:28:19,590
say well you know we probably get away
with it but if we don't

5350
01:28:19,590 --> 01:28:19,600
with it but if we don't
 

5351
01:28:19,600 --> 01:28:21,750
with it but if we don't
then the u.s will know we cheated and

5352
01:28:21,750 --> 01:28:21,760
then the u.s will know we cheated and
 

5353
01:28:21,760 --> 01:28:23,110
then the u.s will know we cheated and
then they're going to go full tilt with

5354
01:28:23,110 --> 01:28:23,120
then they're going to go full tilt with
 

5355
01:28:23,120 --> 01:28:24,550
then they're going to go full tilt with
their program and say look the chinese

5356
01:28:24,550 --> 01:28:24,560
their program and say look the chinese
 

5357
01:28:24,560 --> 01:28:25,590
their program and say look the chinese
are cheaters and that's good

5358
01:28:25,590 --> 01:28:25,600
are cheaters and that's good
 

5359
01:28:25,600 --> 01:28:27,030
are cheaters and that's good
now we have all these weapons against us

5360
01:28:27,030 --> 01:28:27,040
now we have all these weapons against us
 

5361
01:28:27,040 --> 01:28:29,510
now we have all these weapons against us
and that's bad so

5362
01:28:29,510 --> 01:28:29,520
and that's bad so
 

5363
01:28:29,520 --> 01:28:31,990
and that's bad so
the stigma alone is very very powerful

5364
01:28:31,990 --> 01:28:32,000
the stigma alone is very very powerful
 

5365
01:28:32,000 --> 01:28:33,030
the stigma alone is very very powerful
and again

5366
01:28:33,030 --> 01:28:33,040
and again
 

5367
01:28:33,040 --> 01:28:34,470
and again
look what happened with bioweapons right

5368

look what happened with bioweapons right
 

5369
01:28:34,480 --> 01:28:36,229
look what happened with bioweapons right
it's been 50 years now

yeah when was the last time you read
about a bioterrorism attack

the only deaths i really know about with
bioweapons that have happened

5378
01:28:43,830 --> 01:28:43,840
bioweapons that have happened
 

5379
01:28:43,840 --> 01:28:45,669
bioweapons that have happened
when we americans managed to kill some

5380
01:28:45,669 --> 01:28:45,679
when we americans managed to kill some
 

5381
01:28:45,679 --> 01:28:47,350
when we americans managed to kill some
of our own with anthrax you know the

5382
01:28:47,350 --> 01:28:47,360
of our own with anthrax you know the
 

5383
01:28:47,360 --> 01:28:49,350
of our own with anthrax you know the
idiot who sent them to tom daschle and

5384
01:28:49,350 --> 01:28:49,360
idiot who sent them to tom daschle and
 

5385
01:28:49,360 --> 01:28:50,870
idiot who sent them to tom daschle and
others and letters right

5386
01:28:50,870 --> 01:28:50,880
others and letters right
 

5387
01:28:50,880 --> 01:28:54,470
others and letters right
and similarly the in uh zverdlovsk in

5388
01:28:54,470 --> 01:28:54,480
and similarly the in uh zverdlovsk in
 

5389
01:28:54,480 --> 01:28:57,110
and similarly the in uh zverdlovsk in
the soviet union they had some anthrax

5390
01:28:57,110 --> 01:28:57,120
the soviet union they had some anthrax
 

5391
01:28:57,120 --> 01:28:58,390
the soviet union they had some anthrax
and some lab there maybe they were

5392
01:28:58,390 --> 01:28:58,400
and some lab there maybe they were
 

5393
01:28:58,400 --> 01:28:59,910
and some lab there maybe they were
cheating or who knows

5394
01:28:59,910 --> 01:28:59,920
cheating or who knows
 

5395
01:28:59,920 --> 01:29:01,350
cheating or who knows
and it leaked out and killed a bunch of

5396
01:29:01,350 --> 01:29:01,360
and it leaked out and killed a bunch of
 

5397
01:29:01,360 --> 01:29:03,669
and it leaked out and killed a bunch of
russians i'd say that's a pretty good

5398
01:29:03,669 --> 01:29:03,679
russians i'd say that's a pretty good
 

5399
01:29:03,679 --> 01:29:05,669
russians i'd say that's a pretty good
success right 50 years

5400
01:29:05,669 --> 01:29:05,679
success right 50 years
 

5401
01:29:05,679 --> 01:29:08,310
success right 50 years
just two own goals by the superpowers

5402
01:29:08,310 --> 01:29:08,320
just two own goals by the superpowers
 

5403
01:29:08,320 --> 01:29:09,510
just two own goals by the superpowers
and then nothing

5404
01:29:09,510 --> 01:29:09,520
and then nothing
 

5405
01:29:09,520 --> 01:29:11,910
and then nothing
and that's why whenever i ask anyone

5406
01:29:11,910 --> 01:29:11,920
and that's why whenever i ask anyone
 

5407
01:29:11,920 --> 01:29:13,510
and that's why whenever i ask anyone
what they think about biology they they

5408
01:29:13,510 --> 01:29:13,520
what they think about biology they they
 

5409
01:29:13,520 --> 01:29:15,030
what they think about biology they they
think it's great

5410
01:29:15,030 --> 01:29:15,040
think it's great
 

5411
01:29:15,040 --> 01:29:17,430
think it's great
they associate it with new cures new

5412
01:29:17,430 --> 01:29:17,440
they associate it with new cures new
 

5413
01:29:17,440 --> 01:29:19,590
they associate it with new cures new
diseases maybe a good vaccine

5414
01:29:19,590 --> 01:29:19,600
diseases maybe a good vaccine
 

5415
01:29:19,600 --> 01:29:21,669
diseases maybe a good vaccine
this is how i want to think about ai in

5416
01:29:21,669 --> 01:29:21,679
this is how i want to think about ai in
 

5417
01:29:21,679 --> 01:29:23,430
this is how i want to think about ai in
the future i want and i want others to

5418
01:29:23,430 --> 01:29:23,440
the future i want and i want others to
 

5419
01:29:23,440 --> 01:29:24,790
the future i want and i want others to
think about ai too

5420
01:29:24,790 --> 01:29:24,800
think about ai too
 

5421
01:29:24,800 --> 01:29:26,629
think about ai too
as a source of all these great solutions

5422
01:29:26,629 --> 01:29:26,639
as a source of all these great solutions
 

5423
01:29:26,639 --> 01:29:27,830
as a source of all these great solutions
to our problems

5424
01:29:27,830 --> 01:29:27,840
to our problems
 

5425
01:29:27,840 --> 01:29:31,270
to our problems
not as oh ai oh yeah

5426
01:29:31,270 --> 01:29:31,280
not as oh ai oh yeah
 

5427
01:29:31,280 --> 01:29:33,189
not as oh ai oh yeah
that's the reason i feel scared going

5428
01:29:33,189 --> 01:29:33,199
that's the reason i feel scared going
 

5429
01:29:33,199 --> 01:29:34,470
that's the reason i feel scared going
outside these days

5430
01:29:34,470 --> 01:29:34,480
outside these days
 

5431
01:29:34,480 --> 01:29:37,110
outside these days
yes it's kind of brilliant that the

5432
01:29:37,110 --> 01:29:37,120
yes it's kind of brilliant that the
 

5433
01:29:37,120 --> 01:29:39,189
yes it's kind of brilliant that the
bioweapons and nuclear weapons we've

5434
01:29:39,189 --> 01:29:39,199
bioweapons and nuclear weapons we've
 

5435
01:29:39,199 --> 01:29:40,629
bioweapons and nuclear weapons we've
figured out

5436
01:29:40,629 --> 01:29:40,639
figured out
 

5437
01:29:40,639 --> 01:29:42,470
figured out
i mean of course there's still a huge

5438
01:29:42,470 --> 01:29:42,480
i mean of course there's still a huge
 

5439
01:29:42,480 --> 01:29:44,310
i mean of course there's still a huge
source of danger but we figured out

5440
01:29:44,310 --> 01:29:44,320
source of danger but we figured out
 

5441
01:29:44,320 --> 01:29:47,750
source of danger but we figured out
some way of creating rules

5442
01:29:47,750 --> 01:29:47,760
some way of creating rules
 

5443
01:29:47,760 --> 01:29:51,350
some way of creating rules
and social stigma over these weapons

5444
01:29:51,350 --> 01:29:51,360
and social stigma over these weapons
 

5445
01:29:51,360 --> 01:29:52,470
and social stigma over these weapons
that then

5446
01:29:52,470 --> 01:29:52,480
that then
 

5447
01:29:52,480 --> 01:29:55,030
that then
creates a stability to our whatever that

5448
01:29:55,030 --> 01:29:55,040
creates a stability to our whatever that
 

5449
01:29:55,040 --> 01:29:57,110
creates a stability to our whatever that
game theoretic stability that is

5450
01:29:57,110 --> 01:29:57,120
game theoretic stability that is
 

5451
01:29:57,120 --> 01:29:59,110
game theoretic stability that is
exactly and we don't have that with ai

5452
01:29:59,110 --> 01:29:59,120
exactly and we don't have that with ai
 

5453
01:29:59,120 --> 01:30:00,310
exactly and we don't have that with ai
and you're kind of

5454
01:30:00,310 --> 01:30:00,320
and you're kind of
 

5455
01:30:00,320 --> 01:30:03,110
and you're kind of
screaming from the top of the uh the

5456
01:30:03,110 --> 01:30:03,120
screaming from the top of the uh the
 

5457
01:30:03,120 --> 01:30:03,750
screaming from the top of the uh the
mountain

5458
01:30:03,750 --> 01:30:03,760
mountain
 

5459
01:30:03,760 --> 01:30:05,430
mountain
about this that we need to find that

5460
01:30:05,430 --> 01:30:05,440
about this that we need to find that
 

5461
01:30:05,440 --> 01:30:06,790
about this that we need to find that
because um

5462
01:30:06,790 --> 01:30:06,800
because um
 

5463
01:30:06,800 --> 01:30:09,270
because um
just like you know it's very possible

5464
01:30:09,270 --> 01:30:09,280
just like you know it's very possible
 

5465
01:30:09,280 --> 01:30:11,189
just like you know it's very possible
you know with future of life as you

5466
01:30:11,189 --> 01:30:11,199
you know with future of life as you
 

5467
01:30:11,199 --> 01:30:14,470
you know with future of life as you
point out uh institute uh awards

5468
01:30:14,470 --> 01:30:14,480
point out uh institute uh awards
 

5469
01:30:14,480 --> 01:30:16,870
point out uh institute uh awards
pointed out that uh you know with

5470
01:30:16,870 --> 01:30:16,880
pointed out that uh you know with
 

5471
01:30:16,880 --> 01:30:17,990
pointed out that uh you know with
nuclear weapons

5472
01:30:17,990 --> 01:30:18,000
nuclear weapons
 

5473
01:30:18,000 --> 01:30:19,669
nuclear weapons
we could have destroyed ourselves quite

5474
01:30:19,669 --> 01:30:19,679
we could have destroyed ourselves quite
 

5475
01:30:19,679 --> 01:30:22,790
we could have destroyed ourselves quite
a few yeah times and it's um

5476
01:30:22,790 --> 01:30:22,800
a few yeah times and it's um
 

5477
01:30:22,800 --> 01:30:25,910
a few yeah times and it's um
you know it's a learning experience

5478
01:30:25,910 --> 01:30:25,920
you know it's a learning experience
 

5479
01:30:25,920 --> 01:30:29,110
you know it's a learning experience
that uh doesn't it's very costly we gave

5480
01:30:29,110 --> 01:30:29,120
that uh doesn't it's very costly we gave
 

5481
01:30:29,120 --> 01:30:31,110
that uh doesn't it's very costly we gave
you know this future life award

5482
01:30:31,110 --> 01:30:31,120
you know this future life award
 

5483
01:30:31,120 --> 01:30:33,590
you know this future life award
we gave it the first time to this guy

5484
01:30:33,590 --> 01:30:33,600
we gave it the first time to this guy
 

5485
01:30:33,600 --> 01:30:35,750
we gave it the first time to this guy
vasily arkhipov you know he was

5486
01:30:35,750 --> 01:30:35,760
vasily arkhipov you know he was
 

5487
01:30:35,760 --> 01:30:37,590
vasily arkhipov you know he was
on most people haven't even heard of

5488
01:30:37,590 --> 01:30:37,600
on most people haven't even heard of
 

5489
01:30:37,600 --> 01:30:38,790
on most people haven't even heard of
yeah can you say who he is

5490
01:30:38,790 --> 01:30:38,800
yeah can you say who he is
 

5491
01:30:38,800 --> 01:30:41,910
yeah can you say who he is
vasily arkhipov he um

5492
01:30:41,910 --> 01:30:41,920
vasily arkhipov he um
 

5493
01:30:41,920 --> 01:30:45,030
vasily arkhipov he um
has in my opinion made the

5494
01:30:45,030 --> 01:30:45,040
has in my opinion made the
 

5495
01:30:45,040 --> 01:30:47,110
has in my opinion made the
greatest positive contribution to

5496
01:30:47,110 --> 01:30:47,120
greatest positive contribution to
 

5497
01:30:47,120 --> 01:30:48,790
greatest positive contribution to
humanity of any human

5498
01:30:48,790 --> 01:30:48,800
humanity of any human
 

5499
01:30:48,800 --> 01:30:51,110
humanity of any human
in modern history and maybe it sounds

5500
01:30:51,110 --> 01:30:51,120
in modern history and maybe it sounds
 

5501
01:30:51,120 --> 01:30:52,870
in modern history and maybe it sounds
like hyperbole here like i'm just

5502
01:30:52,870 --> 01:30:52,880
like hyperbole here like i'm just
 

5503
01:30:52,880 --> 01:30:54,310
like hyperbole here like i'm just
over the top but let me tell you the

5504
01:30:54,310 --> 01:30:54,320
over the top but let me tell you the
 

5505
01:30:54,320 --> 01:30:56,149
over the top but let me tell you the
story and i think maybe you'll agree

5506
01:30:56,149 --> 01:30:56,159
story and i think maybe you'll agree
 

5507
01:30:56,159 --> 01:31:00,229
story and i think maybe you'll agree
so during the cuban missile crisis

5508
01:31:00,229 --> 01:31:00,239

 

5509
01:31:00,239 --> 01:31:02,149

we americans first didn't know that the

5510
01:31:02,149 --> 01:31:02,159
we americans first didn't know that the
 

5511
01:31:02,159 --> 01:31:05,270
we americans first didn't know that the
russians had sent four submarines

5512
01:31:05,270 --> 01:31:05,280
russians had sent four submarines
 

5513
01:31:05,280 --> 01:31:07,590
russians had sent four submarines
but we caught two of them and we didn't

5514
01:31:07,590 --> 01:31:07,600
but we caught two of them and we didn't
 

5515
01:31:07,600 --> 01:31:08,310
but we caught two of them and we didn't
know that

5516
01:31:08,310 --> 01:31:08,320
know that
 

5517
01:31:08,320 --> 01:31:10,709
know that
that so we dropped practice depth

5518
01:31:10,709 --> 01:31:10,719
that so we dropped practice depth
 

5519
01:31:10,719 --> 01:31:12,310
that so we dropped practice depth
charges on the one that he was on

5520
01:31:12,310 --> 01:31:12,320
charges on the one that he was on
 

5521
01:31:12,320 --> 01:31:15,510
charges on the one that he was on
to try to force it to the surface

5522
01:31:15,510 --> 01:31:15,520
to try to force it to the surface
 

5523
01:31:15,520 --> 01:31:17,430
to try to force it to the surface
but we didn't know that this nuclear

5524
01:31:17,430 --> 01:31:17,440
but we didn't know that this nuclear
 

5525
01:31:17,440 --> 01:31:18,709
but we didn't know that this nuclear
submarine actually was a nuclear

5526
01:31:18,709 --> 01:31:18,719

01:33:48,719 --> 01:33:50,629
not avoiding something bad but for
something good the guys who

5690
01:33:50,629 --> 01:33:50,639
something good the guys who
 

5691
01:33:50,639 --> 01:33:52,310
something good the guys who
eliminated this disease which is way

5692
01:33:52,310 --> 01:33:52,320
eliminated this disease which is way
 

5693
01:33:52,320 --> 01:33:54,390
eliminated this disease which is way
worse than covent

5694
01:33:54,390 --> 01:33:54,400
worse than covent
 

5695
01:33:54,400 --> 01:33:56,790
worse than covent
that had killed a half a billion people

5696
01:33:56,790 --> 01:33:56,800
that had killed a half a billion people
 

5697
01:33:56,800 --> 01:33:58,390
that had killed a half a billion people
in in the past its final century

5698
01:33:58,390 --> 01:33:58,400
in in the past its final century
 

5699
01:33:58,400 --> 01:33:59,590
in in the past its final century
smallpox right so

5700
01:33:59,590 --> 01:33:59,600
smallpox right so
 

5701
01:33:59,600 --> 01:34:03,110
smallpox right so
we mentioned it earlier coved on average

5702
01:34:03,110 --> 01:34:03,120
we mentioned it earlier coved on average
 

5703
01:34:03,120 --> 01:34:04,470
we mentioned it earlier coved on average
kills less than one percent of people

5704
01:34:04,470 --> 01:34:04,480
kills less than one percent of people
 

5705
01:34:04,480 --> 01:34:08,070
kills less than one percent of people
who get it smallpox about 30 percent

5706
01:34:08,070 --> 01:34:08,080
who get it smallpox about 30 percent
 

5707
01:34:08,080 --> 01:34:12,550
who get it smallpox about 30 percent
and um they just ultimately victor donov

5708
01:34:12,550 --> 01:34:12,560
and um they just ultimately victor donov
 

5709
01:34:12,560 --> 01:34:14,870
and um they just ultimately victor donov
and bill feige most my colleagues have

5710
01:34:14,870 --> 01:34:14,880
and bill feige most my colleagues have
 

5711
01:34:14,880 --> 01:34:16,550
and bill feige most my colleagues have
never heard of either of them

5712
01:34:16,550 --> 01:34:16,560
never heard of either of them
 

5713
01:34:16,560 --> 01:34:20,149
never heard of either of them
um one american one russian they

5714
01:34:20,149 --> 01:34:20,159
um one american one russian they
 

5715
01:34:20,159 --> 01:34:22,709
um one american one russian they
did this amazing effort not only what

5716
01:34:22,709 --> 01:34:22,719
did this amazing effort not only what
 

5717
01:34:22,719 --> 01:34:23,510
did this amazing effort not only what
was

5718
01:34:23,510 --> 01:34:23,520
was
 

5719
01:34:23,520 --> 01:34:25,110
was
able to get the us and the soviet union

5720
01:34:25,110 --> 01:34:25,120
able to get the us and the soviet union
 

5721
01:34:25,120 --> 01:34:26,950
able to get the us and the soviet union
to team up against smallpox during the

5722
01:34:26,950 --> 01:34:26,960
to team up against smallpox during the
 

5723
01:34:26,960 --> 01:34:27,750
to team up against smallpox during the
cold war

5724
01:34:27,750 --> 01:34:27,760
cold war
 

5725
01:34:27,760 --> 01:34:29,110
cold war
but bill feige came up with this

5726
01:34:29,110 --> 01:34:29,120
but bill feige came up with this
 

5727
01:34:29,120 --> 01:34:30,950
but bill feige came up with this
ingenious strategy for making it

5728
01:34:30,950 --> 01:34:30,960
ingenious strategy for making it
 

5729
01:34:30,960 --> 01:34:32,070
ingenious strategy for making it
actually

5730
01:34:32,070 --> 01:34:32,080
actually
 

5731
01:34:32,080 --> 01:34:35,430
actually
go all the way to defeat the disease

5732
01:34:35,430 --> 01:34:35,440
go all the way to defeat the disease
 

5733
01:34:35,440 --> 01:34:37,110
go all the way to defeat the disease
with without funding for vaccinating

5734
01:34:37,110 --> 01:34:37,120
with without funding for vaccinating
 

5735
01:34:37,120 --> 01:34:39,510
with without funding for vaccinating
everyone and as a result we haven't had

5736
01:34:39,510 --> 01:34:39,520
everyone and as a result we haven't had
 

5737
01:34:39,520 --> 01:34:42,310
everyone and as a result we haven't had
any we went from 15 million deaths the

5738
01:34:42,310 --> 01:34:42,320
any we went from 15 million deaths the
 

5739
01:34:42,320 --> 01:34:44,229
any we went from 15 million deaths the
year i was born in smallpox

5740
01:34:44,229 --> 01:34:44,239
year i was born in smallpox
 

5741
01:34:44,239 --> 01:34:45,669
year i was born in smallpox
so what do we have in covet now a little

5742
01:34:45,669 --> 01:34:45,679
so what do we have in covet now a little
 

5743
01:34:45,679 --> 01:34:48,070
so what do we have in covet now a little
bit short of two million right yes

5744
01:34:48,070 --> 01:34:48,080
bit short of two million right yes
 

5745
01:34:48,080 --> 01:34:50,629
bit short of two million right yes
to zero deaths of course this year and

5746
01:34:50,629 --> 01:34:50,639
to zero deaths of course this year and
 

5747
01:34:50,639 --> 01:34:51,830
to zero deaths of course this year and
forever

5748
01:34:51,830 --> 01:34:51,840
forever
 

5749
01:34:51,840 --> 01:34:54,229
forever
there have been 200 million people they

5750
01:34:54,229 --> 01:34:54,239
there have been 200 million people they
 

5751
01:34:54,239 --> 01:34:55,750
there have been 200 million people they
estimate who would have died

5752
01:34:55,750 --> 01:34:55,760
estimate who would have died
 

5753
01:34:55,760 --> 01:34:57,669
estimate who would have died
since then by smallpox had it not been

5754
01:34:57,669 --> 01:34:57,679
since then by smallpox had it not been
 

5755
01:34:57,679 --> 01:34:59,990
since then by smallpox had it not been
for this so isn't science awesome can't

5756
01:34:59,990 --> 01:35:00,000
for this so isn't science awesome can't
 

5757
01:35:00,000 --> 01:35:00,310
for this so isn't science awesome can't
that

5758
01:35:00,310 --> 01:35:00,320
that
 

5759
01:35:00,320 --> 01:35:02,390
that
when you use it for good and the reason

5760
01:35:02,390 --> 01:35:02,400
when you use it for good and the reason
 

5761
01:35:02,400 --> 01:35:03,590
when you use it for good and the reason
we want to celebrate these sort of

5762
01:35:03,590 --> 01:35:03,600
we want to celebrate these sort of
 

5763
01:35:03,600 --> 01:35:04,229
we want to celebrate these sort of
people is

5764
01:35:04,229 --> 01:35:04,239
people is
 

5765
01:35:04,239 --> 01:35:07,109
people is
is to remind them of this science is so

5766
01:35:07,109 --> 01:35:07,119
is to remind them of this science is so
 

5767
01:35:07,119 --> 01:35:07,669
is to remind them of this science is so
awesome

5768
01:35:07,669 --> 01:35:07,679
awesome
 

5769
01:35:07,679 --> 01:35:10,709
awesome
when you use it for good and those

5770
01:35:10,709 --> 01:35:10,719
when you use it for good and those
 

5771
01:35:10,719 --> 01:35:13,109
when you use it for good and those
those awards actually uh the variety

5772
01:35:13,109 --> 01:35:13,119
those awards actually uh the variety
 

5773
01:35:13,119 --> 01:35:13,990
those awards actually uh the variety
there paint's a very

5774
01:35:13,990 --> 01:35:14,000
there paint's a very
 

5775
01:35:14,000 --> 01:35:17,669
there paint's a very
interesting picture so the the the first

5776
01:35:17,669 --> 01:35:17,679
interesting picture so the the the first
 

5777
01:35:17,679 --> 01:35:18,149
interesting picture so the the the first
two

5778
01:35:18,149 --> 01:35:18,159
two
 

5779
01:35:18,159 --> 01:35:20,149
two
are looking at it's kind of exciting to

5780
01:35:20,149 --> 01:35:20,159
are looking at it's kind of exciting to
 

5781
01:35:20,159 --> 01:35:21,430
are looking at it's kind of exciting to
think that these these

5782
01:35:21,430 --> 01:35:21,440
think that these these
 

5783
01:35:21,440 --> 01:35:23,990
think that these these
average humans in some sense that

5784
01:35:23,990 --> 01:35:24,000
average humans in some sense that
 

5785
01:35:24,000 --> 01:35:27,109
average humans in some sense that
they're products of you know billions of

5786
01:35:27,109 --> 01:35:27,119
they're products of you know billions of
 

5787
01:35:27,119 --> 01:35:28,950
they're products of you know billions of
other humans that came before them

5788
01:35:28,950 --> 01:35:28,960
other humans that came before them
 

5789
01:35:28,960 --> 01:35:30,709
other humans that came before them
evolution and some

5790
01:35:30,709 --> 01:35:30,719
evolution and some
 

5791
01:35:30,719 --> 01:35:33,669
evolution and some
little you said gut you know but there's

5792
01:35:33,669 --> 01:35:33,679
little you said gut you know but there's
 

5793
01:35:33,679 --> 01:35:34,390
little you said gut you know but there's
something

5794
01:35:34,390 --> 01:35:34,400
something
 

5795
01:35:34,400 --> 01:35:37,750
something
in there that that uh

5796
01:35:37,750 --> 01:35:37,760
in there that that uh
 

5797
01:35:37,760 --> 01:35:40,070
in there that that uh
stopped the annihilation of the human

5798
01:35:40,070 --> 01:35:40,080
stopped the annihilation of the human
 

5799
01:35:40,080 --> 01:35:41,030
stopped the annihilation of the human
race

5800
01:35:41,030 --> 01:35:41,040
race
 

5801
01:35:41,040 --> 01:35:43,270
race
and that's a magical thing but that's

5802
01:35:43,270 --> 01:35:43,280
and that's a magical thing but that's
 

5803
01:35:43,280 --> 01:35:45,270
and that's a magical thing but that's
like this deeply human thing

5804
01:35:45,270 --> 01:35:45,280
like this deeply human thing
 

5805
01:35:45,280 --> 01:35:47,990
like this deeply human thing
and then there's the other aspect where

5806
01:35:47,990 --> 01:35:48,000
and then there's the other aspect where
 

5807
01:35:48,000 --> 01:35:49,750
and then there's the other aspect where
that's also very human

5808
01:35:49,750 --> 01:35:49,760
that's also very human
 

5809
01:35:49,760 --> 01:35:53,189
that's also very human
which is to build solution to the to the

5810
01:35:53,189 --> 01:35:53,199
which is to build solution to the to the
 

5811
01:35:53,199 --> 01:35:55,189
which is to build solution to the to the
existential crises that we're facing

5812
01:35:55,189 --> 01:35:55,199
existential crises that we're facing
 

5813
01:35:55,199 --> 01:35:56,709
existential crises that we're facing
like to build it to take the

5814
01:35:56,709 --> 01:35:56,719
like to build it to take the
 

5815
01:35:56,719 --> 01:35:58,390
like to build it to take the
responsibility and to take

5816
01:35:58,390 --> 01:35:58,400
responsibility and to take
 

5817
01:35:58,400 --> 01:35:59,830
responsibility and to take
come up with different technologies and

5818
01:35:59,830 --> 01:35:59,840
come up with different technologies and
 

5819
01:35:59,840 --> 01:36:02,550
come up with different technologies and
so on yeah and both of those are

5820
01:36:02,550 --> 01:36:02,560
so on yeah and both of those are
 

5821
01:36:02,560 --> 01:36:06,310
so on yeah and both of those are
deeply human the gut and and the mind

5822
01:36:06,310 --> 01:36:06,320
deeply human the gut and and the mind
 

5823
01:36:06,320 --> 01:36:07,990
deeply human the gut and and the mind
whatever that is the best is when they

5824
01:36:07,990 --> 01:36:08,000
whatever that is the best is when they
 

5825
01:36:08,000 --> 01:36:09,830
whatever that is the best is when they
work together archipelago

5826
01:36:09,830 --> 01:36:09,840

we in america admire in our military
because first of all he was very loyal

5840
01:36:22,629 --> 01:36:22,639
because first of all he was very loyal
 

5841
01:36:22,639 --> 01:36:24,149
because first of all he was very loyal
of course he never even told anyone

5842
01:36:24,149 --> 01:36:24,159
of course he never even told anyone
 

5843
01:36:24,159 --> 01:36:25,030
of course he never even told anyone
about this

5844
01:36:25,030 --> 01:36:25,040
about this
 

5845
01:36:25,040 --> 01:36:26,790
about this
during his whole life even though you

5846
01:36:26,790 --> 01:36:26,800
during his whole life even though you
 

5847
01:36:26,800 --> 01:36:28,310
during his whole life even though you
think he had some bragging rights right

5848
01:36:28,310 --> 01:36:28,320
think he had some bragging rights right
 

5849
01:36:28,320 --> 01:36:29,350
think he had some bragging rights right
but he just was like this is just

5850
01:36:29,350 --> 01:36:29,360

of cancer later also but he's seen many
 

5877
01:37:00,400 --> 01:37:01,830
of cancer later also but he's seen many
of his crew members die and

i think was just like that so when the
 

5923
01:37:42,159 --> 01:37:43,590
i think was just like that so when the
explosion starts going off and his

5924
01:37:43,590 --> 01:37:43,600
explosion starts going off and his
 

5925
01:37:43,600 --> 01:37:45,109
explosion starts going off and his
captain is screaming and we should nuke

5926
01:37:45,109 --> 01:37:45,119
captain is screaming and we should nuke
 

5927
01:37:45,119 --> 01:37:45,669
captain is screaming and we should nuke
them and

01:37:45,669 --> 01:37:45,679
them and
 

5929
01:37:45,679 --> 01:37:51,030
them and

one loud explosion on the left one on

5950
01:38:09,109 --> 01:38:09,119
one loud explosion on the left one on
 

5951
01:38:09,119 --> 01:38:10,070
one loud explosion on the left one on
the right

5952
01:38:10,070 --> 01:38:10,080
the right
 

5953
01:38:10,080 --> 01:38:12,229
the right
one on the left one on the right he was

5954
01:38:12,229 --> 01:38:12,239
one on the left one on the right he was
 

5955
01:38:12,239 --> 01:38:15,669
one on the left one on the right he was
the only one who noticed this pattern

5956
01:38:15,669 --> 01:38:15,679

 

5957
01:38:15,679 --> 01:38:17,990

and it is like i think this is them

5958
01:38:17,990 --> 01:38:18,000
and it is like i think this is them
 

5959
01:38:18,000 --> 01:38:20,550
and it is like i think this is them
trying to send us a signal

5960
01:38:20,550 --> 01:38:20,560
trying to send us a signal
 

5961
01:38:20,560 --> 01:38:23,030
trying to send us a signal
that they want us to surface and they're

5962
01:38:23,030 --> 01:38:23,040
that they want us to surface and they're
 

5963
01:38:23,040 --> 01:38:24,149
that they want us to surface and they're
not going to sink us

5964
01:38:24,149 --> 01:38:24,159
not going to sink us
 

5965
01:38:24,159 --> 01:38:29,109
not going to sink us
uh and somehow

5966
01:38:29,109 --> 01:38:29,119

 

5967
01:38:29,119 --> 01:38:30,390

this is how he then managed to

5968
01:38:30,390 --> 01:38:30,400
this is how he then managed to
 

5969
01:38:30,400 --> 01:38:33,189
this is how he then managed to
ultimately with his

5970
01:38:33,189 --> 01:38:33,199
ultimately with his
 

5971
01:38:33,199 --> 01:38:36,229
ultimately with his
combination of gut and also just

5972
01:38:36,229 --> 01:38:36,239
combination of gut and also just
 

5973
01:38:36,239 --> 01:38:38,310
combination of gut and also just
cool analytical thinking was able to

5974
01:38:38,310 --> 01:38:38,320
cool analytical thinking was able to
 

5975
01:38:38,320 --> 01:38:39,990
cool analytical thinking was able to
de-escalate the whole thing

5976
01:38:39,990 --> 01:38:40,000
de-escalate the whole thing
 

5977
01:38:40,000 --> 01:38:43,590
de-escalate the whole thing
and uh yeah so this is some of the best

5978
01:38:43,590 --> 01:38:43,600
and uh yeah so this is some of the best
 

5979
01:38:43,600 --> 01:38:44,950
and uh yeah so this is some of the best
in humanity i guess coming back to what

5980
01:38:44,950 --> 01:38:44,960
in humanity i guess coming back to what
 

5981
01:38:44,960 --> 01:38:45,910
in humanity i guess coming back to what
we talked about earlier is the

5982
01:38:45,910 --> 01:38:45,920
we talked about earlier is the
 

5983
01:38:45,920 --> 01:38:47,910
we talked about earlier is the
combination of the neural network

5984
01:38:47,910 --> 01:38:47,920
combination of the neural network
 

5985
01:38:47,920 --> 01:38:50,470
combination of the neural network
you know with uh i'm getting the tearing

5986
01:38:50,470 --> 01:38:50,480
you know with uh i'm getting the tearing
 

5987
01:38:50,480 --> 01:38:51,830
you know with uh i'm getting the tearing
up here getting emotional but

5988
01:38:51,830 --> 01:38:51,840
up here getting emotional but
 

5989
01:38:51,840 --> 01:38:55,109

5996
01:39:01,510 --> 01:39:01,520
especially in that time
 

5997
01:39:01,520 --> 01:39:03,750
especially in that time
uh there's something about the i mean

5998
01:39:03,750 --> 01:39:03,760
uh there's something about the i mean
 

5999
01:39:03,760 --> 01:39:04,550
uh there's something about the i mean
this is a very

6000
01:39:04,550 --> 01:39:04,560
this is a very
 

6001
01:39:04,560 --> 01:39:06,229
this is a very
in america people are used to this kind

6002
01:39:06,229 --> 01:39:06,239
in america people are used to this kind
 

6003
01:39:06,239 --> 01:39:08,629
in america people are used to this kind
of idea of being the individual

6004
01:39:08,629 --> 01:39:08,639
of idea of being the individual
 

6005
01:39:08,639 --> 01:39:12,070
of idea of being the individual
um of like on your own thinking yeah i

6006
01:39:12,070 --> 01:39:12,080
um of like on your own thinking yeah i
 

6007
01:39:12,080 --> 01:39:12,790
um of like on your own thinking yeah i
think

6008
01:39:12,790 --> 01:39:12,800
think
 

6009
01:39:12,800 --> 01:39:14,470
think
under in the soviet union under

6010
01:39:14,470 --> 01:39:14,480
under in the soviet union under
 

6011
01:39:14,480 --> 01:39:16,629
under in the soviet union under
communism it's actually much harder

6012

communism it's actually much harder
 

6013
01:39:16,639 --> 01:39:18,709
communism it's actually much harder
to do that oh yeah he didn't even he

6014
01:39:18,709 --> 01:39:18,719
to do that oh yeah he didn't even he
 

6015
01:39:18,719 --> 01:39:19,830
to do that oh yeah he didn't even he
even got

6016
01:39:19,830 --> 01:39:19,840
even got
 

6017
01:39:19,840 --> 01:39:21,830
even got
he didn't get any accolades either when

6018
01:39:21,830 --> 01:39:21,840
he didn't get any accolades either when
 

6019
01:39:21,840 --> 01:39:23,590
he didn't get any accolades either when
he came back for this right

6020
01:39:23,590 --> 01:39:23,600
he came back for this right
 

6021
01:39:23,600 --> 01:39:25,189
he came back for this right
uh they just wanted to hush the whole

6022
01:39:25,189 --> 01:39:25,199
uh they just wanted to hush the whole
 

6023
01:39:25,199 --> 01:39:27,030
uh they just wanted to hush the whole
thing up yeah there's echoes of that

6024
01:39:27,030 --> 01:39:27,040
thing up yeah there's echoes of that
 

6025
01:39:27,040 --> 01:39:30,229
thing up yeah there's echoes of that
with chernobyl there's all kinds of um

6026
01:39:30,229 --> 01:39:30,239
with chernobyl there's all kinds of um
 

6027
01:39:30,239 --> 01:39:33,430
with chernobyl there's all kinds of um
uh that's one that's that's a really

6028
01:39:33,430 --> 01:39:33,440
uh that's one that's that's a really
 

6029
01:39:33,440 --> 01:39:34,310
uh that's one that's that's a really
hopeful thing

6030
01:39:34,310 --> 01:39:34,320
hopeful thing
 

6031
01:39:34,320 --> 01:39:37,430
hopeful thing
that amidst big centralized powers

6032
01:39:37,430 --> 01:39:37,440
that amidst big centralized powers
 

6033
01:39:37,440 --> 01:39:38,550
that amidst big centralized powers
whether it's companies

6034
01:39:38,550 --> 01:39:38,560
whether it's companies
 

6035
01:39:38,560 --> 01:39:41,189
whether it's companies
or states there's still the power of the

6041
01:39:45,119 --> 01:39:47,030
to think on their own to act but i think
we need to think of people like this

6042
01:39:47,030 --> 01:39:47,040
we need to think of people like this
 

6043
01:39:47,040 --> 01:39:49,990
we need to think of people like this
not as a panacea we can always count on

6044
01:39:49,990 --> 01:39:50,000
not as a panacea we can always count on
 

6045
01:39:50,000 --> 01:39:52,870
not as a panacea we can always count on
but rather as

6046
01:39:52,870 --> 01:39:52,880

 

6047
01:39:52,880 --> 01:39:55,910

a wake-up call you know so

6048
01:39:55,910 --> 01:39:55,920
a wake-up call you know so
 

6049
01:39:55,920 --> 01:39:58,629
a wake-up call you know so
because of them because of archipov we

6050
01:39:58,629 --> 01:39:58,639
because of them because of archipov we
 

6051
01:39:58,639 --> 01:40:01,189
because of them because of archipov we
are alive to learn from this lesson

6052
01:40:01,189 --> 01:40:01,199
are alive to learn from this lesson
 

6053
01:40:01,199 --> 01:40:02,550
are alive to learn from this lesson
to learn from the fact that we shouldn't

6054
01:40:02,550 --> 01:40:02,560
to learn from the fact that we shouldn't
 

6055
01:40:02,560 --> 01:40:03,990

keep playing russian roulette and almost

6056
01:40:03,990 --> 01:40:04,000
keep playing russian roulette and almost
 

6057
01:40:04,000 --> 01:40:05,430
keep playing russian roulette and almost
have a nuclear war by mistake

6058
01:40:05,430 --> 01:40:05,440
have a nuclear war by mistake
 

6059
01:40:05,440 --> 01:40:07,910
have a nuclear war by mistake
now and then because relying on luck is

6060
01:40:07,910 --> 01:40:07,920
now and then because relying on luck is
 

6061
01:40:07,920 --> 01:40:09,430
now and then because relying on luck is
not a good long-term strategy

6062
01:40:09,430 --> 01:40:09,440
not a good long-term strategy
 

6063
01:40:09,440 --> 01:40:10,870
not a good long-term strategy
if you keep playing russian inlet over

6064
01:40:10,870 --> 01:40:10,880
if you keep playing russian inlet over
 

6065
01:40:10,880 --> 01:40:11,830
if you keep playing russian inlet over
and over again the probability of

6066
01:40:11,830 --> 01:40:11,840
and over again the probability of
 

6067
01:40:11,840 --> 01:40:13,669
and over again the probability of
surviving just drops exponentially with

6068
01:40:13,669 --> 01:40:13,679
surviving just drops exponentially with
 

6069
01:40:13,679 --> 01:40:14,149
surviving just drops exponentially with
time

6070
01:40:14,149 --> 01:40:14,159
time
 

6071
01:40:14,159 --> 01:40:16,629
time
yeah and if you have some probability of

6072
01:40:16,629 --> 01:40:16,639
yeah and if you have some probability of
 

6073
01:40:16,639 --> 01:40:18,550
yeah and if you have some probability of
having an accidental new core every year

6074
01:40:18,550 --> 01:40:18,560
having an accidental new core every year
 

6075
01:40:18,560 --> 01:40:20,070
having an accidental new core every year
the probability of not having one

6076
01:40:20,070 --> 01:40:20,080
the probability of not having one
 

6077
01:40:20,080 --> 01:40:21,669
the probability of not having one
also drops exponentially i think we can

6078
01:40:21,669 --> 01:40:21,679
also drops exponentially i think we can
 

6079
01:40:21,679 --> 01:40:24,070
also drops exponentially i think we can
do better than that so i i think

6080
01:40:24,070 --> 01:40:24,080
do better than that so i i think
 

6081
01:40:24,080 --> 01:40:26,310
do better than that so i i think
uh the message is very clear once in a

while happens
 

6085
01:40:27,760 --> 01:40:30,310
while happens
and um there's a lot of very concrete

6086
01:40:30,310 --> 01:40:30,320
and um there's a lot of very concrete
 

6087
01:40:30,320 --> 01:40:32,229
and um there's a lot of very concrete
things we can do

6088
01:40:32,229 --> 01:40:32,239
things we can do
 

6089
01:40:32,239 --> 01:40:34,470
things we can do
to reduce the risk of things like that

6090
01:40:34,470 --> 01:40:34,480
to reduce the risk of things like that
 

6091
01:40:34,480 --> 01:40:36,470
to reduce the risk of things like that
happening in the first place

my many conversations with elon yeah i

6154
01:41:44,310 --> 01:41:44,320
my many conversations with elon yeah i
 

6155
01:41:44,320 --> 01:41:46,950
my many conversations with elon yeah i
i certainly have a model of how how he

6156
01:41:46,950 --> 01:41:46,960
i certainly have a model of how how he
 

6157
01:41:46,960 --> 01:41:48,229
i certainly have a model of how how he
thinks it's actually very

thinks it's actually very
 

6159
01:41:48,239 --> 01:41:50,070
thinks it's actually very
much like the way i think also i'll

6160
01:41:50,070 --> 01:41:50,080
much like the way i think also i'll
 

6161
01:41:50,080 --> 01:41:52,070
much like the way i think also i'll
elaborate on it a bit i just want to

6162
01:41:52,070 --> 01:41:52,080
elaborate on it a bit i just want to
 

6163
01:41:52,080 --> 01:41:54,709
elaborate on it a bit i just want to
push back on when you said evil people i

6164
01:41:54,709 --> 01:41:54,719
push back on when you said evil people i
 

6165
01:41:54,719 --> 01:41:57,430
push back on when you said evil people i
i don't think it's very helpful context

6166
01:41:57,430 --> 01:41:57,440
i don't think it's very helpful context
 

6167
01:41:57,440 --> 01:42:00,310
i don't think it's very helpful context
concept evil people yes sometimes people

6168
01:42:00,310 --> 01:42:00,320
concept evil people yes sometimes people
 

6169
01:42:00,320 --> 01:42:02,229
concept evil people yes sometimes people
do very very bad things

6170
01:42:02,229 --> 01:42:02,239
do very very bad things
 

6171
01:42:02,239 --> 01:42:03,830
do very very bad things

think it's a good thing yes
because somehow other people had told

because somehow other people had told
 

6177

because somehow other people had told
them that that was a good thing or given

6178
01:42:09,109 --> 01:42:09,119
them that that was a good thing or given

right um i i have

6184
01:42:16,229 --> 01:42:16,239
right um i i have
 

6185
01:42:16,239 --> 01:42:17,830
right um i i have
i believe in the fundamental goodness of

6186
01:42:17,830 --> 01:42:17,840
i believe in the fundamental goodness of
 

6187
01:42:17,840 --> 01:42:20,390
i believe in the fundamental goodness of
humanity that if we

6188
01:42:20,390 --> 01:42:20,400
humanity that if we
 

6189
01:42:20,400 --> 01:42:22,310
humanity that if we
educate people well and they find out

6190
01:42:22,310 --> 01:42:22,320
educate people well and they find out
 

6191
01:42:22,320 --> 01:42:24,149
educate people well and they find out
how things really are

6192
01:42:24,149 --> 01:42:24,159
how things really are
 

6193
01:42:24,159 --> 01:42:26,830
how things really are
people generally want to do good and be

6194
01:42:26,830 --> 01:42:26,840
people generally want to do good and be

good
 

6197
01:42:28,239 --> 01:42:31,350
good
hence the value alignment as yeah it's

6198
01:42:31,350 --> 01:42:31,360
hence the value alignment as yeah it's
 

6199
01:42:31,360 --> 01:42:31,830
hence the value alignment as yeah it's
it's

6200
01:42:31,830 --> 01:42:31,840
it's
 

6201
01:42:31,840 --> 01:42:33,750
it's
about information about knowledge and

6202
01:42:33,750 --> 01:42:33,760
about information about knowledge and
 

6203
01:42:33,760 --> 01:42:35,590
about information about knowledge and
then once we have that we'll

6204
01:42:35,590 --> 01:42:35,600
then once we have that we'll
 

6205
01:42:35,600 --> 01:42:38,709
then once we have that we'll
we'll uh we'll likely be able to

6206
01:42:38,709 --> 01:42:38,719
we'll uh we'll likely be able to
 

6207
01:42:38,719 --> 01:42:40,709
we'll uh we'll likely be able to
uh do good in the way that's aligned

6208
01:42:40,709 --> 01:42:40,719
uh do good in the way that's aligned
 

6209
01:42:40,719 --> 01:42:41,990
uh do good in the way that's aligned
with everybody else who thinks

6210
01:42:41,990 --> 01:42:42,000
with everybody else who thinks
 

6211
01:42:42,000 --> 01:42:43,430
with everybody else who thinks
yeah and it's not just the individual

6212
01:42:43,430 --> 01:42:43,440
yeah and it's not just the individual
 

6213
01:42:43,440 --> 01:42:45,350
yeah and it's not just the individual
people we have to align so

6214
01:42:45,350 --> 01:42:45,360
people we have to align so
 

6215
01:42:45,360 --> 01:42:48,870
people we have to align so
we we don't just want people to

6216
01:42:48,870 --> 01:42:48,880
we we don't just want people to
 

6217
01:42:48,880 --> 01:42:50,390
we we don't just want people to
be educated to know the way things

6218
01:42:50,390 --> 01:42:50,400
be educated to know the way things
 

6219
01:42:50,400 --> 01:42:52,310
be educated to know the way things
actually are and to treat each other

6220
01:42:52,310 --> 01:42:52,320
actually are and to treat each other
 

6221
01:42:52,320 --> 01:42:53,189
actually are and to treat each other
well

6222
01:42:53,189 --> 01:42:53,199
well
 

6223
01:42:53,199 --> 01:42:55,270
well
but we also need to align other

6224
01:42:55,270 --> 01:42:55,280
but we also need to align other
 

6225
01:42:55,280 --> 01:42:56,870
but we also need to align other
non-human entities we talked about

6226
01:42:56,870 --> 01:42:56,880
non-human entities we talked about
 

6227
01:42:56,880 --> 01:42:57,910
non-human entities we talked about
corporations there has to be

6228
01:42:57,910 --> 01:42:57,920
corporations there has to be
 

6229
01:42:57,920 --> 01:42:59,430
corporations there has to be
institutions so that what they do is

6230
01:42:59,430 --> 01:42:59,440
institutions so that what they do is
 

6231
01:42:59,440 --> 01:43:00,790
institutions so that what they do is
actually good for the country they're in

6232
01:43:00,790 --> 01:43:00,800
actually good for the country they're in
 

6233
01:43:00,800 --> 01:43:01,189
actually good for the country they're in

and
 

6235
01:43:01,199 --> 01:43:02,790
and
we should align do make sure that what

6236
01:43:02,790 --> 01:43:02,800
we should align do make sure that what
 

6237
01:43:02,800 --> 01:43:05,350
we should align do make sure that what
countries do is actually good for

6238

countries do is actually good for
 

6239
01:43:05,360 --> 01:43:07,910
countries do is actually good for
the species as a whole etc uh coming

how elon sees this is really quite
 

6247
01:43:14,239 --> 01:43:16,310
how elon sees this is really quite
similar to my own which is

6248
01:43:16,310 --> 01:43:16,320
similar to my own which is
 

6249

right and if you when you look in this

01:43:38,149 --> 01:43:38,159
right and if you when you look in this
 

6273
01:43:38,159 --> 01:43:40,470
right and if you when you look in this
more cosmic perspective it's so obvious

01:43:40,470 --> 01:43:40,480
more cosmic perspective it's so obvious
 

6275
01:43:40,480 --> 01:43:42,470
more cosmic perspective it's so obvious
that we are gazing out into this

that we are gazing out into this
 

6277
01:43:42,480 --> 01:43:45,030
that we are gazing out into this

and and he sees this enormous
 

6285
01:43:51,920 --> 01:43:53,350
and and he sees this enormous
opportunity for our universe to come

6334
01:44:41,990 --> 01:44:42,000
and why shouldn't we insist on that
 

6335
01:44:42,000 --> 01:44:44,390
and why shouldn't we insist on that
we're building them after all right

6336
01:44:44,390 --> 01:44:44,400
we're building them after all right
 

6337
01:44:44,400 --> 01:44:45,910
we're building them after all right
why should we build things that just

6338
01:44:45,910 --> 01:44:45,920
why should we build things that just
 

6339
01:44:45,920 --> 01:44:47,830
why should we build things that just
make us into some little cog in the

6340
01:44:47,830 --> 01:44:47,840
make us into some little cog in the
 

6341
01:44:47,840 --> 01:44:49,430
make us into some little cog in the
machinery that has no further say in the

6342
01:44:49,430 --> 01:44:49,440
machinery that has no further say in the
 

6343
01:44:49,440 --> 01:44:52,390
machinery that has no further say in the
matter right it's not my idea of

6344
01:44:52,390 --> 01:44:52,400
matter right it's not my idea of
 

6345
01:44:52,400 --> 01:44:55,750
matter right it's not my idea of
an inspiring future either yeah the if

6346
01:44:55,750 --> 01:44:55,760
an inspiring future either yeah the if
 

6347
01:44:55,760 --> 01:44:57,830
an inspiring future either yeah the if
if you think on the cosmic scale in

6348
01:44:57,830 --> 01:44:57,840
if you think on the cosmic scale in
 

6349
01:44:57,840 --> 01:45:00,790
if you think on the cosmic scale in
terms of both time and space

6350
01:45:00,790 --> 01:45:00,800
terms of both time and space
 

6351
01:45:00,800 --> 01:45:04,070
terms of both time and space
so much is put into perspective yeah

6352
01:45:04,070 --> 01:45:04,080
so much is put into perspective yeah
 

6353
01:45:04,080 --> 01:45:05,750
so much is put into perspective yeah
whenever i have a bad day that's what i

6354
01:45:05,750 --> 01:45:05,760
whenever i have a bad day that's what i
 

6355
01:45:05,760 --> 01:45:07,990
whenever i have a bad day that's what i
think about it immediately makes me feel

6356
01:45:07,990 --> 01:45:08,000
think about it immediately makes me feel
 

6357
01:45:08,000 --> 01:45:09,109
think about it immediately makes me feel
better

6358
01:45:09,109 --> 01:45:09,119
better
 

6359
01:45:09,119 --> 01:45:12,149
better
it makes me sad that for us individual

6360
01:45:12,149 --> 01:45:12,159
it makes me sad that for us individual
 

6361
01:45:12,159 --> 01:45:15,109
it makes me sad that for us individual
humans at least for now the ride ends

6362
01:45:15,109 --> 01:45:15,119
humans at least for now the ride ends
 

6363
01:45:15,119 --> 01:45:16,950
humans at least for now the ride ends
too quickly

6364
01:45:16,950 --> 01:45:16,960
too quickly
 

6365
01:45:16,960 --> 01:45:19,669
too quickly
we don't get to experience the cosmic

6366
01:45:19,669 --> 01:45:19,679
we don't get to experience the cosmic
 

6367
01:45:19,679 --> 01:45:20,070
we don't get to experience the cosmic
scale

6368
01:45:20,070 --> 01:45:20,080
scale
 

6369
01:45:20,080 --> 01:45:21,669
scale
yeah i mean i think of our universe

6370
01:45:21,669 --> 01:45:21,679
yeah i mean i think of our universe
 

6371
01:45:21,679 --> 01:45:23,270
yeah i mean i think of our universe
sometimes as an organism that has only

6372
01:45:23,270 --> 01:45:23,280
sometimes as an organism that has only
 

6373
01:45:23,280 --> 01:45:25,590
sometimes as an organism that has only
begun to wake up a tiny bit

6374
01:45:25,590 --> 01:45:25,600
begun to wake up a tiny bit
 

6375
01:45:25,600 --> 01:45:27,590
begun to wake up a tiny bit
uh just like you know when you're in the

6376
01:45:27,590 --> 01:45:27,600
uh just like you know when you're in the
 

6377
01:45:27,600 --> 01:45:28,709
uh just like you know when you're in the
the very first

6378
01:45:28,709 --> 01:45:28,719
the very first
 

6379
01:45:28,719 --> 01:45:30,149
the very first
little glimmers of consciousness you

6380
01:45:30,149 --> 01:45:30,159
little glimmers of consciousness you
 

6381
01:45:30,159 --> 01:45:31,510
little glimmers of consciousness you
have in the morning when you start

6382
01:45:31,510 --> 01:45:31,520
have in the morning when you start
 

6383
01:45:31,520 --> 01:45:33,030
have in the morning when you start
coming around for the coffee

6384
01:45:33,030 --> 01:45:33,040
coming around for the coffee
 

6385
01:45:33,040 --> 01:45:35,189
coming around for the coffee
before the coffee even before you get

6386
01:45:35,189 --> 01:45:35,199
before the coffee even before you get
 

6387
01:45:35,199 --> 01:45:36,629
before the coffee even before you get
out of bed before you even open your

6388
01:45:36,629 --> 01:45:36,639
out of bed before you even open your
 

6389
01:45:36,639 --> 01:45:37,189
out of bed before you even open your
eyes

6390
01:45:37,189 --> 01:45:37,199
eyes
 

6391
01:45:37,199 --> 01:45:40,149
eyes
you start start to wake up a little bit

6392
01:45:40,149 --> 01:45:40,159
you start start to wake up a little bit
 

6393
01:45:40,159 --> 01:45:43,430
you start start to wake up a little bit
there's something here you know

6394
01:45:43,430 --> 01:45:43,440

 

6395
01:45:43,440 --> 01:45:45,990

that's very much how i think of of where

6396
01:45:45,990 --> 01:45:46,000
that's very much how i think of of where
 

6397
01:45:46,000 --> 01:45:47,830
that's very much how i think of of where
we are you know those all those galaxies

6398
01:45:47,830 --> 01:45:47,840
we are you know those all those galaxies
 

6399
01:45:47,840 --> 01:45:49,270
we are you know those all those galaxies
out there you know i think they're

6400
01:45:49,270 --> 01:45:49,280
out there you know i think they're
 

6401
01:45:49,280 --> 01:45:51,830
out there you know i think they're
really beautiful but why are they

6402
01:45:51,830 --> 01:45:51,840
really beautiful but why are they
 

6403
01:45:51,840 --> 01:45:52,790
really beautiful but why are they
beautiful

6404
01:45:52,790 --> 01:45:52,800
beautiful
 

6405
01:45:52,800 --> 01:45:54,470
beautiful
they're beautiful because conscious

6406
01:45:54,470 --> 01:45:54,480
they're beautiful because conscious
 

6407
01:45:54,480 --> 01:45:56,229
they're beautiful because conscious
entities are actually

6408
01:45:56,229 --> 01:45:56,239
entities are actually
 

6409
01:45:56,239 --> 01:45:57,830
entities are actually
observing them and experiencing them

6410
01:45:57,830 --> 01:45:57,840
observing them and experiencing them
 

6411
01:45:57,840 --> 01:45:59,590
observing them and experiencing them
through our telescopes

6412
01:45:59,590 --> 01:45:59,600
through our telescopes
 

6413
01:45:59,600 --> 01:46:03,430
through our telescopes
if i you know i define consciousness

6414
01:46:03,430 --> 01:46:03,440
if i you know i define consciousness
 

6415
01:46:03,440 --> 01:46:06,390
if i you know i define consciousness
as subjective experience whether it be

6416
01:46:06,390 --> 01:46:06,400
as subjective experience whether it be
 

6417
01:46:06,400 --> 01:46:09,350
as subjective experience whether it be
colors or emotions or sounds

6418
01:46:09,350 --> 01:46:09,360
colors or emotions or sounds
 

6419
01:46:09,360 --> 01:46:12,950
colors or emotions or sounds
so beauty is an experience meaning is an

6420
01:46:12,950 --> 01:46:12,960
so beauty is an experience meaning is an
 

6421
01:46:12,960 --> 01:46:13,750
so beauty is an experience meaning is an
experience

6422
01:46:13,750 --> 01:46:13,760
experience
 

6423
01:46:13,760 --> 01:46:16,470
experience
purpose is an experience if there was no

6424
01:46:16,470 --> 01:46:16,480
purpose is an experience if there was no
 

6425
01:46:16,480 --> 01:46:17,830
purpose is an experience if there was no
conscious experience of

6426
01:46:17,830 --> 01:46:17,840
conscious experience of
 

6427
01:46:17,840 --> 01:46:19,109
conscious experience of
observing these galaxies they wouldn't

6428
01:46:19,109 --> 01:46:19,119
observing these galaxies they wouldn't
 

6429
01:46:19,119 --> 01:46:22,310
observing these galaxies they wouldn't
be beautiful if if we do something dumb

6430
01:46:22,310 --> 01:46:22,320
be beautiful if if we do something dumb
 

6431
01:46:22,320 --> 01:46:26,070
be beautiful if if we do something dumb
with advanced ai in the future here and

6432
01:46:26,070 --> 01:46:26,080
with advanced ai in the future here and
 

6433
01:46:26,080 --> 01:46:29,189
with advanced ai in the future here and
earth originating life goes extinct

6434
01:46:29,189 --> 01:46:29,199
earth originating life goes extinct
 

6435
01:46:29,199 --> 01:46:30,950
earth originating life goes extinct
and that was it for this if there is

6436
01:46:30,950 --> 01:46:30,960
and that was it for this if there is
 

6437
01:46:30,960 --> 01:46:33,109
and that was it for this if there is
nothing else with telescopes in our

6438
01:46:33,109 --> 01:46:33,119
nothing else with telescopes in our
 

6439
01:46:33,119 --> 01:46:34,629
nothing else with telescopes in our
universe then

6440
01:46:34,629 --> 01:46:34,639
universe then
 

6441
01:46:34,639 --> 01:46:36,550
universe then
it's kind of game over for me beauty and

6442
01:46:36,550 --> 01:46:36,560
it's kind of game over for me beauty and
 

6443
01:46:36,560 --> 01:46:37,590
it's kind of game over for me beauty and
meaning and purpose in our whole

6444
01:46:37,590 --> 01:46:37,600
meaning and purpose in our whole
 

6445
01:46:37,600 --> 01:46:39,189
meaning and purpose in our whole
universe and i think that would be just

6446
01:46:39,189 --> 01:46:39,199
universe and i think that would be just
 

6447
01:46:39,199 --> 01:46:41,990
universe and i think that would be just
such an opportunity lost frankly and i

6448
01:46:41,990 --> 01:46:42,000
such an opportunity lost frankly and i
 

6449
01:46:42,000 --> 01:46:44,070
such an opportunity lost frankly and i
think

6450
01:46:44,070 --> 01:46:44,080
think
 

6451
01:46:44,080 --> 01:46:46,790
think
when elon points this out he gets very

6452
01:46:46,790 --> 01:46:46,800
when elon points this out he gets very
 

6453
01:46:46,800 --> 01:46:47,830
when elon points this out he gets very
unfairly

6454
01:46:47,830 --> 01:46:47,840
unfairly
 

6455
01:46:47,840 --> 01:46:50,149
unfairly
maligned in the media for all the dumb

6456
01:46:50,149 --> 01:46:50,159
maligned in the media for all the dumb
 

6457
01:46:50,159 --> 01:46:52,310
maligned in the media for all the dumb
media bias reasons we talked about right

6458
01:46:52,310 --> 01:46:52,320
media bias reasons we talked about right
 

6459
01:46:52,320 --> 01:46:55,109
media bias reasons we talked about right
they print precisely the things about

6460
01:46:55,109 --> 01:46:55,119
they print precisely the things about
 

6461
01:46:55,119 --> 01:46:56,790
they print precisely the things about
elon out of context

6462

elon out of context
 

6463
01:46:56,800 --> 01:46:58,950
elon out of context
that are really click-baity like he has

6464
01:46:58,950 --> 01:46:58,960
that are really click-baity like he has
 

6465
01:46:58,960 --> 01:47:00,390
that are really click-baity like he has
gotten so much flack

6466
01:47:00,390 --> 01:47:00,400
gotten so much flack
 

6467
01:47:00,400 --> 01:47:04,149

it could also end even worse where there

isn't we're not superseded by leaving
any ai behind either way we just

6790
01:52:35,830 --> 01:52:35,840
any ai behind either way we just
 

6791
01:52:35,840 --> 01:52:37,669

totally wipe out you know like on easter

6792
01:52:37,669 --> 01:52:37,679
totally wipe out you know like on easter

01:52:37,679 --> 01:52:39,750
totally wipe out you know like on easter
island our century is long

6794
01:52:39,750 --> 01:52:39,760

6795
01:52:39,760 --> 01:52:43,350
island our century is long
no it's there are still 79 years left of

6796
01:52:43,350 --> 01:52:43,360
no it's there are still 79 years left of
 

6797
01:52:43,360 --> 01:52:44,950
no it's there are still 79 years left of
it right think about how

6798
01:52:44,950 --> 01:52:44,960
it right think about how
 

6799
01:52:44,960 --> 01:52:47,589
it right think about how
far we've come just in the last 30 years

6800
01:52:47,589 --> 01:52:47,599
far we've come just in the last 30 years
 

6801
01:52:47,599 --> 01:52:49,350
far we've come just in the last 30 years
so

6802
01:52:49,350 --> 01:52:49,360
so
 

6803
01:52:49,360 --> 01:52:52,709
so
we can talk more about what might go

6804
01:52:52,709 --> 01:52:52,719
we can talk more about what might go
 

6805
01:52:52,719 --> 01:52:54,149
we can talk more about what might go
wrong but you asked me this really good

6806
01:52:54,149 --> 01:52:54,159
wrong but you asked me this really good
 

6807
01:52:54,159 --> 01:52:55,669

is it neuralink

6810
01:52:57,350 --> 01:52:57,360
is it neuralink
 

6811
01:52:57,360 --> 01:52:59,830
is it neuralink
russell's approach or or whatever i

6812
01:52:59,830 --> 01:52:59,840
russell's approach or or whatever i
 

6813
01:52:59,840 --> 01:53:01,910
russell's approach or or whatever i
think um

6814
01:53:01,910 --> 01:53:01,920
think um
 

6815
01:53:01,920 --> 01:53:03,510
think um
like you know when when we did the

6816
01:53:03,510 --> 01:53:03,520
like you know when when we did the
 

6817
01:53:03,520 --> 01:53:05,350
like you know when when we did the
manhattan project

6818
01:53:05,350 --> 01:53:05,360
manhattan project
 

6819
01:53:05,360 --> 01:53:08,390
manhattan project
we didn't know if any of our four ideas

6820
01:53:08,390 --> 01:53:08,400
we didn't know if any of our four ideas
 

6821
01:53:08,400 --> 01:53:10,229
we didn't know if any of our four ideas
for enriching uranium

6822
01:53:10,229 --> 01:53:10,239
for enriching uranium
 

6823
01:53:10,239 --> 01:53:11,669
for enriching uranium
and getting out the uranium uranium-235

6824
01:53:11,669 --> 01:53:11,679
and getting out the uranium uranium-235
 

6825
01:53:11,679 --> 01:53:13,589
and getting out the uranium uranium-235
were going to work but we felt this was

6826
01:53:13,589 --> 01:53:13,599
were going to work but we felt this was
 

6827
01:53:13,599 --> 01:53:14,629
were going to work but we felt this was
really important

6828
01:53:14,629 --> 01:53:14,639
really important
 

6829
01:53:14,639 --> 01:53:16,950
really important
to get it before hitler did so you know

6830
01:53:16,950 --> 01:53:16,960
to get it before hitler did so you know
 

6831
01:53:16,960 --> 01:53:19,430
to get it before hitler did so you know
what we did we tried all four of them

6832
01:53:19,430 --> 01:53:19,440
what we did we tried all four of them
 

6833
01:53:19,440 --> 01:53:23,030
what we did we tried all four of them
here i think it's it's analogous where

6834
01:53:23,030 --> 01:53:23,040
here i think it's it's analogous where
 

6835
01:53:23,040 --> 01:53:24,709
here i think it's it's analogous where
there's the greatest threat that's ever

6836
01:53:24,709 --> 01:53:24,719
there's the greatest threat that's ever
 

6837
01:53:24,719 --> 01:53:26,790
there's the greatest threat that's ever
faced our species and of course u.s

6838
01:53:26,790 --> 01:53:26,800
faced our species and of course u.s
 

6839
01:53:26,800 --> 01:53:29,189
faced our species and of course u.s
national security by implication

6840
01:53:29,189 --> 01:53:29,199
national security by implication
 

6841
01:53:29,199 --> 01:53:31,030
national security by implication
we don't know if we don't have any

6842
01:53:31,030 --> 01:53:31,040
we don't know if we don't have any
 

6843
01:53:31,040 --> 01:53:33,270
we don't know if we don't have any
method that's guaranteed to work but we

6844
01:53:33,270 --> 01:53:33,280
method that's guaranteed to work but we
 

6845
01:53:33,280 --> 01:53:34,550
method that's guaranteed to work but we
have a lot of ideas

6846
01:53:34,550 --> 01:53:34,560
have a lot of ideas
 

6847
01:53:34,560 --> 01:53:35,990
have a lot of ideas
so we should invest pretty heavily in

6848
01:53:35,990 --> 01:53:36,000
so we should invest pretty heavily in
 

6849
01:53:36,000 --> 01:53:37,990
so we should invest pretty heavily in
pursuing all of them with an open mind

6850
01:53:37,990 --> 01:53:38,000
pursuing all of them with an open mind
 

6851
01:53:38,000 --> 01:53:40,550
pursuing all of them with an open mind
and hope that one of them at least works

6852
01:53:40,550 --> 01:53:40,560
and hope that one of them at least works
 

6853
01:53:40,560 --> 01:53:41,910
and hope that one of them at least works
these are

6854
01:53:41,910 --> 01:53:41,920
these are
 

6855
01:53:41,920 --> 01:53:44,629
these are
the good news is the century is long you

6856
01:53:44,629 --> 01:53:44,639
the good news is the century is long you
 

6857
01:53:44,639 --> 01:53:45,270
the good news is the century is long you
know

6858
01:53:45,270 --> 01:53:45,280
know
 

6859
01:53:45,280 --> 01:53:48,790
know
and it might take decades until we have

6860
01:53:48,790 --> 01:53:48,800
and it might take decades until we have
 

6861
01:53:48,800 --> 01:53:50,310
and it might take decades until we have
artificial general intelligence so we

6862
01:53:50,310 --> 01:53:50,320
artificial general intelligence so we
 

6863
01:53:50,320 --> 01:53:52,709
artificial general intelligence so we
have some time hopefully

6864
01:53:52,709 --> 01:53:52,719
have some time hopefully
 

6865
01:53:52,719 --> 01:53:55,109
have some time hopefully
but it takes a long time als to solve

6866
01:53:55,109 --> 01:53:55,119
but it takes a long time als to solve
 

6867
01:53:55,119 --> 01:53:57,030
but it takes a long time als to solve
these very very difficult problems

6868
01:53:57,030 --> 01:53:57,040
these very very difficult problems
 

6869
01:53:57,040 --> 01:53:58,390
these very very difficult problems
it's going to actually be it's the most

6870
01:53:58,390 --> 01:53:58,400
it's going to actually be it's the most
 

6871
01:53:58,400 --> 01:53:59,669
it's going to actually be it's the most
difficult problem we're ever trying to

6872
01:53:59,669 --> 01:53:59,679
difficult problem we're ever trying to
 

6873
01:53:59,679 --> 01:54:01,270
difficult problem we're ever trying to
solve as a species

6874
01:54:01,270 --> 01:54:01,280
solve as a species
 

6875
01:54:01,280 --> 01:54:04,149
solve as a species
so we have to start now so we don't have

6876
01:54:04,149 --> 01:54:04,159
so we have to start now so we don't have
 

6877
01:54:04,159 --> 01:54:05,350
so we have to start now so we don't have
rather than you know begin thinking

01:54:05,350 --> 01:54:05,360
rather than you know begin thinking
 

6879
01:54:05,360 --> 01:54:07,270
rather than you know begin thinking
about it the night before

6880
01:54:07,270 --> 01:54:07,280
about it the night before
 

6881
01:54:07,280 --> 01:54:08,709
about it the night before
some people have had too much red bull

6882
01:54:08,709 --> 01:54:08,719
some people have had too much red bull
 

6883
01:54:08,719 --> 01:54:10,790
some people have had too much red bull
switching on and we have to

6884
01:54:10,790 --> 01:54:10,800
switching on and we have to
 

6885
01:54:10,800 --> 01:54:12,070
switching on and we have to
coming back to your question we have to

6886
01:54:12,070 --> 01:54:12,080
coming back to your question we have to
 

6887
01:54:12,080 --> 01:54:13,669
coming back to your question we have to
pursue all of these different avenues

6888
01:54:13,669 --> 01:54:13,679
pursue all of these different avenues
 

6889
01:54:13,679 --> 01:54:14,149
pursue all of these different avenues
and see

6890
01:54:14,149 --> 01:54:14,159
and see
 

6891
01:54:14,159 --> 01:54:16,950
and see
if you're my investment advisor and i

6892
01:54:16,950 --> 01:54:16,960
if you're my investment advisor and i
 

6893
01:54:16,960 --> 01:54:18,070
if you're my investment advisor and i
was trying to invest

6894
01:54:18,070 --> 01:54:18,080
was trying to invest
 

6895
01:54:18,080 --> 01:54:21,109
was trying to invest
in the future how do you think the human

6896
01:54:21,109 --> 01:54:21,119
in the future how do you think the human
 

6897
01:54:21,119 --> 01:54:22,950
in the future how do you think the human
species

6898
01:54:22,950 --> 01:54:22,960
species
 

6899
01:54:22,960 --> 01:54:26,390
species
is most likely to destroy itself in

6900
01:54:26,390 --> 01:54:26,400
is most likely to destroy itself in
 

6901
01:54:26,400 --> 01:54:29,430
is most likely to destroy itself in
this century

6902

6903
01:54:29,440 --> 01:54:32,390

yeah in uh so if if the crisis many of

6904
01:54:32,390 --> 01:54:32,400
yeah in uh so if if the crisis many of
 

6905
01:54:32,400 --> 01:54:33,990
yeah in uh so if if the crisis many of
the crisis we're facing are really

6906
01:54:33,990 --> 01:54:34,000
the crisis we're facing are really
 

6907
01:54:34,000 --> 01:54:37,350
the crisis we're facing are really
before us within the next hundred years

6908
01:54:37,350 --> 01:54:37,360
before us within the next hundred years
 

6909
01:54:37,360 --> 01:54:42,550
before us within the next hundred years
how do we make explicit the

6910
01:54:42,550 --> 01:54:42,560
how do we make explicit the
 

6911
01:54:42,560 --> 01:54:45,669
how do we make explicit the
make known the the unknowns and solve

6912
01:54:45,669 --> 01:54:45,679
make known the the unknowns and solve
 

6913
01:54:45,679 --> 01:54:46,550
make known the the unknowns and solve
those problems

6914

those problems
 

6915
01:54:46,560 --> 01:54:50,149
those problems

and then retain our goals so
 

6951
01:55:24,159 --> 01:55:27,350
and then retain our goals so
to hit on all three real quickly

6952

autopilot to fly into the alps
 

6957
01:55:32,560 --> 01:55:35,510
autopilot to fly into the alps
was that the computer didn't even

6958
01:55:35,510 --> 01:55:35,520
was that the computer didn't even

too dumb it could have understood
 

6965
01:55:41,440 --> 01:55:42,629
too dumb it could have understood
actually

6966
01:55:42,629 --> 01:55:42,639
actually
 

6967
01:55:42,639 --> 01:55:45,109
actually
but we would have had to put some effort

6968
01:55:45,109 --> 01:55:45,119
but we would have had to put some effort
 

6969
01:55:45,119 --> 01:55:45,669
but we would have had to put some effort
in as a

so that's the first challenge how do you
 

6977
01:55:50,480 --> 01:55:53,669
so that's the first challenge how do you
how do you program into computers

6978
01:55:53,669 --> 01:55:53,679
how do you program into computers

01:55:53,679 --> 01:55:56,870
how do you program into computers
human values human goals we can start

6980
01:55:56,870 --> 01:55:56,880
human values human goals we can start
 

6981
01:55:56,880 --> 01:55:58,870
human values human goals we can start
rather than than saying oh it's so hard

6982
01:55:58,870 --> 01:55:58,880
rather than than saying oh it's so hard
 

6983
01:55:58,880 --> 01:56:00,229
rather than than saying oh it's so hard
we should start with the simple stuff

6984
01:56:00,229 --> 01:56:00,239
we should start with the simple stuff
 

6985
01:56:00,239 --> 01:56:03,990
we should start with the simple stuff
as i said self-driving cars airplanes

6986
01:56:03,990 --> 01:56:04,000
as i said self-driving cars airplanes
 

6987
01:56:04,000 --> 01:56:05,669
as i said self-driving cars airplanes
just put in all the goals that we all

6988
01:56:05,669 --> 01:56:05,679
just put in all the goals that we all
 

6989
01:56:05,679 --> 01:56:07,109
just put in all the goals that we all
agree on already

6990
01:56:07,109 --> 01:56:07,119
agree on already
 

6991
01:56:07,119 --> 01:56:09,350
agree on already
and then have a habit of whenever

6992
01:56:09,350 --> 01:56:09,360
and then have a habit of whenever
 

6993
01:56:09,360 --> 01:56:11,270
and then have a habit of whenever
machines get smarter so they can

6994
01:56:11,270 --> 01:56:11,280
machines get smarter so they can
 

6995
01:56:11,280 --> 01:56:14,070
machines get smarter so they can
understand one level higher goals you

6996
01:56:14,070 --> 01:56:14,080
understand one level higher goals you
 

6997
01:56:14,080 --> 01:56:15,350
understand one level higher goals you
know

6998
01:56:15,350 --> 01:56:15,360
know
 

6999
01:56:15,360 --> 01:56:18,149
know
put them into uh the second challenge is

7000
01:56:18,149 --> 01:56:18,159
put them into uh the second challenge is
 

7001
01:56:18,159 --> 01:56:18,870
put them into uh the second challenge is

uh
 

7003
01:56:18,880 --> 01:56:20,950
uh
getting them to adopt the goals it's

7004
01:56:20,950 --> 01:56:20,960
getting them to adopt the goals it's
 

7005
01:56:20,960 --> 01:56:22,390
getting them to adopt the goals it's
easy for situations like that where you

7006
01:56:22,390 --> 01:56:22,400
easy for situations like that where you
 

7007
01:56:22,400 --> 01:56:23,830
easy for situations like that where you
just program it in but when you have

7008
01:56:23,830 --> 01:56:23,840
just program it in but when you have
 

7009
01:56:23,840 --> 01:56:26,070
just program it in but when you have
self-learning systems like children you

7010
01:56:26,070 --> 01:56:26,080
self-learning systems like children you
 

7011
01:56:26,080 --> 01:56:27,430
self-learning systems like children you
know

any parent knows that um
 

7015
01:56:31,599 --> 01:56:33,109
any parent knows that um
there's a difference between getting our

7016
01:56:33,109 --> 01:56:33,119
there's a difference between getting our
 

7017
01:56:33,119 --> 01:56:34,629
there's a difference between getting our
kids to understand what we want them to

7018
01:56:34,629 --> 01:56:34,639
kids to understand what we want them to
 

7019
01:56:34,639 --> 01:56:35,910
kids to understand what we want them to
do and to actually

7020
01:56:35,910 --> 01:56:35,920
do and to actually
 

7021
01:56:35,920 --> 01:56:38,790
do and to actually
adopt our goals right with with humans

7022
01:56:38,790 --> 01:56:38,800
adopt our goals right with with humans
 

7023
01:56:38,800 --> 01:56:39,189

children fortunately they
they go through this phrase first

7028
01:56:44,070 --> 01:56:44,080
they go through this phrase first
 

7029
01:56:44,080 --> 01:56:45,669
they go through this phrase first
they're too dumb to understand what we

7030
01:56:45,669 --> 01:56:45,679
they're too dumb to understand what we
 

7031
01:56:45,679 --> 01:56:46,149
they're too dumb to understand what we
want

01:56:46,149 --> 01:56:46,159
want
 

7033
01:56:46,159 --> 01:56:48,070
want
our goals are and then they have this

7034
01:56:48,070 --> 01:56:48,080
our goals are and then they have this
 

7035
01:56:48,080 --> 01:56:49,350
our goals are and then they have this
period of

7036
01:56:49,350 --> 01:56:49,360
period of
 

7037
01:56:49,360 --> 01:56:51,109
period of
some years when they're both smart

7038
01:56:51,109 --> 01:56:51,119
some years when they're both smart
 

7039
01:56:51,119 --> 01:56:52,550
some years when they're both smart
enough to understand them and malleable

7040
01:56:52,550 --> 01:56:52,560
enough to understand them and malleable
 

7041
01:56:52,560 --> 01:56:54,470
enough to understand them and malleable
enough that we have a chance to

7042
01:56:54,470 --> 01:56:54,480
enough that we have a chance to
 

7043
01:56:54,480 --> 01:56:56,070
enough that we have a chance to
raise them well and then they become

7044
01:56:56,070 --> 01:56:56,080
raise them well and then they become
 

7045
01:56:56,080 --> 01:56:57,750
raise them well and then they become
teenagers it's

7046
01:56:57,750 --> 01:56:57,760
teenagers it's
 

7047
01:56:57,760 --> 01:57:00,550
teenagers it's
kind of too late but we have this window

7048
01:57:00,550 --> 01:57:00,560
kind of too late but we have this window
 

7049
01:57:00,560 --> 01:57:02,629
kind of too late but we have this window
with machines the challenges they might

7050
01:57:02,629 --> 01:57:02,639
with machines the challenges they might
 

7051
01:57:02,639 --> 01:57:04,070
with machines the challenges they might
the intelligence might grow so fast that

7052
01:57:04,070 --> 01:57:04,080
the intelligence might grow so fast that
 

7053
01:57:04,080 --> 01:57:06,709
the intelligence might grow so fast that
that window is pretty short

7054
01:57:06,709 --> 01:57:06,719
that window is pretty short
 

7055
01:57:06,719 --> 01:57:08,550
that window is pretty short
so that's a that's the research problem

7056
01:57:08,550 --> 01:57:08,560
so that's a that's the research problem
 

7057
01:57:08,560 --> 01:57:09,990
so that's a that's the research problem
the third one is how do you make sure

7058
01:57:09,990 --> 01:57:10,000
the third one is how do you make sure
 

7059
01:57:10,000 --> 01:57:11,350
the third one is how do you make sure
they keep the goals

7060
01:57:11,350 --> 01:57:11,360
they keep the goals
 

7061
01:57:11,360 --> 01:57:12,950
they keep the goals
if they keep learning more and getting

7062
01:57:12,950 --> 01:57:12,960
if they keep learning more and getting
 

7063
01:57:12,960 --> 01:57:14,470
if they keep learning more and getting
smarter

7064
01:57:14,470 --> 01:57:14,480
smarter
 

7065
01:57:14,480 --> 01:57:16,790
smarter
many sci-fi movies are about how you

7066
01:57:16,790 --> 01:57:16,800
many sci-fi movies are about how you
 

7067
01:57:16,800 --> 01:57:18,149
many sci-fi movies are about how you
have something which initially was a

7068
01:57:18,149 --> 01:57:18,159
have something which initially was a
 

7069
01:57:18,159 --> 01:57:18,870
have something which initially was a
line but then

7070
01:57:18,870 --> 01:57:18,880
line but then
 

7071
01:57:18,880 --> 01:57:21,350
line but then
things kind of go off keel and you know

01:57:21,360 --> 01:57:22,390
things kind of go off keel and you know
my kids

7074
01:57:22,390 --> 01:57:22,400
my kids
 

7075
01:57:22,400 --> 01:57:25,990
my kids
were very very excited about their legos

7076
01:57:25,990 --> 01:57:26,000
were very very excited about their legos
 

7077
01:57:26,000 --> 01:57:27,270
were very very excited about their legos
when they were little

7078
01:57:27,270 --> 01:57:27,280
when they were little
 

7079
01:57:27,280 --> 01:57:28,629
when they were little
now they're just gathering dust in the

7080
01:57:28,629 --> 01:57:28,639
now they're just gathering dust in the
 

7081
01:57:28,639 --> 01:57:30,310
now they're just gathering dust in the
basement you know if we put

7082
01:57:30,310 --> 01:57:30,320
basement you know if we put
 

7083
01:57:30,320 --> 01:57:32,229
basement you know if we put
if we create machines that are really on

7084
01:57:32,229 --> 01:57:32,239
if we create machines that are really on

01:57:36,310 --> 01:57:36,320
bored with us and
 

7091
01:57:36,320 --> 01:57:39,350
bored with us and
and as my kids go with legos

7092
01:57:39,350 --> 01:57:39,360
and as my kids go with legos
 

7093
01:57:39,360 --> 01:57:41,830
and as my kids go with legos
so this is another research challenge

7094
01:57:41,830 --> 01:57:41,840
so this is another research challenge
 

7095
01:57:41,840 --> 01:57:42,790
so this is another research challenge
how can you make some sort of

01:57:42,790 --> 01:57:42,800
how can you make some sort of

adult people still play with legos so

7102
01:57:50,950 --> 01:57:50,960
adult people still play with legos so
 

7103
01:57:50,960 --> 01:57:53,589
adult people still play with legos so
maybe we succeeded with the legos

7104
01:57:53,589 --> 01:57:53,599
maybe we succeeded with the legos
 

7105
01:57:53,599 --> 01:57:56,950
maybe we succeeded with the legos
i like your optimism so not all ai

01:58:07,280 --> 01:58:10,870
heard of this and want to work on it
not so much funding for it yet

7120
01:58:10,870 --> 01:58:10,880

 

7121
01:58:10,880 --> 01:58:12,470

it's only a minuscule fraction so far

7126
01:58:16,550 --> 01:58:16,560
it's only a minuscule fraction so far
 

7127
01:58:16,560 --> 01:58:18,149
it's only a minuscule fraction so far
going into the safety research

7128
01:58:18,149 --> 01:58:18,159
going into the safety research
 

7129
01:58:18,159 --> 01:58:19,750
going into the safety research
my attitude is generally we should not

7130
01:58:19,750 --> 01:58:19,760
my attitude is generally we should not
 

7131
01:58:19,760 --> 01:58:21,669
my attitude is generally we should not
try to slow down the technology but we

7132
01:58:21,669 --> 01:58:21,679
try to slow down the technology but we
 

7133
01:58:21,679 --> 01:58:23,270
try to slow down the technology but we
should greatly accelerate the investment

7134
01:58:23,270 --> 01:58:23,280
should greatly accelerate the investment
 

7135
01:58:23,280 --> 01:58:25,030
should greatly accelerate the investment
in this sort of safety research

7136
01:58:25,030 --> 01:58:25,040
in this sort of safety research
 

7137
01:58:25,040 --> 01:58:27,750
in this sort of safety research
um and also make sure it's been it's

7138
01:58:27,750 --> 01:58:27,760
um and also make sure it's been it's
 

7139
01:58:27,760 --> 01:58:29,669
um and also make sure it's been it's
this was very embarrassing last year but

7140
01:58:29,669 --> 01:58:29,679
this was very embarrassing last year but
 

7141
01:58:29,679 --> 01:58:31,910
this was very embarrassing last year but
you know the nsf decided to give out the

7142
01:58:31,910 --> 01:58:31,920
you know the nsf decided to give out the
 

7143
01:58:31,920 --> 01:58:34,070
you know the nsf decided to give out the
six of these big institutes we got one

7144
01:58:34,070 --> 01:58:34,080
six of these big institutes we got one
 

7145
01:58:34,080 --> 01:58:35,589
six of these big institutes we got one
of them for ai and science

7146
01:58:35,589 --> 01:58:35,599
of them for ai and science
 

7147
01:58:35,599 --> 01:58:37,510
of them for ai and science
you asked me about another one was

7148
01:58:37,510 --> 01:58:37,520
you asked me about another one was
 

7149
01:58:37,520 --> 01:58:40,629
you asked me about another one was
supposed to be for ai safety research

7150
01:58:40,629 --> 01:58:40,639
supposed to be for ai safety research
 

7151
01:58:40,639 --> 01:58:43,430
supposed to be for ai safety research
and they gave it people studying oceans

7152
01:58:43,430 --> 01:58:43,440
and they gave it people studying oceans
 

7153
01:58:43,440 --> 01:58:46,470
and they gave it people studying oceans
and climate and stuff

7154
01:58:46,470 --> 01:58:46,480
and climate and stuff
 

7155
01:58:46,480 --> 01:58:48,790
and climate and stuff
yeah so i'm all for starting oceans and

7156
01:58:48,790 --> 01:58:48,800
yeah so i'm all for starting oceans and
 

7157
01:58:48,800 --> 01:58:50,470
yeah so i'm all for starting oceans and
climates but we need to actually

7158
01:58:50,470 --> 01:58:50,480
climates but we need to actually
 

7159
01:58:50,480 --> 01:58:51,910
climates but we need to actually
have some money that actually goes into

7160
01:58:51,910 --> 01:58:51,920
have some money that actually goes into
 

7161
01:58:51,920 --> 01:58:53,910
have some money that actually goes into
ai safety research also and doesn't just

7162
01:58:53,910 --> 01:58:53,920
ai safety research also and doesn't just
 

7163
01:58:53,920 --> 01:58:55,669
ai safety research also and doesn't just
get grabbed by whatever

7164
01:58:55,669 --> 01:58:55,679
get grabbed by whatever
 

7165
01:58:55,679 --> 01:58:58,149
get grabbed by whatever
um that's a fantastic investment and

7166
01:58:58,149 --> 01:58:58,159
um that's a fantastic investment and
 

7167
01:58:58,159 --> 01:58:59,510
um that's a fantastic investment and
then at the higher level

7168
01:58:59,510 --> 01:58:59,520
then at the higher level
 

7169
01:58:59,520 --> 01:59:02,070
then at the higher level
you ask this question okay what can we

7170
01:59:02,070 --> 01:59:02,080
you ask this question okay what can we
 

7171
01:59:02,080 --> 01:59:05,109
you ask this question okay what can we
do you know what are the biggest risks

7172
01:59:05,109 --> 01:59:05,119
do you know what are the biggest risks
 

7173
01:59:05,119 --> 01:59:08,550
do you know what are the biggest risks
i think i think we cannot just consider

7174
01:59:08,550 --> 01:59:08,560
i think i think we cannot just consider
 

7175
01:59:08,560 --> 01:59:10,470
i think i think we cannot just consider
this to be only a technical problem

7176
01:59:10,470 --> 01:59:10,480
this to be only a technical problem
 

7177
01:59:10,480 --> 01:59:12,629
this to be only a technical problem
like again because if you solve only the

01:59:12,629 --> 01:59:12,639
like again because if you solve only the
 

7179
01:59:12,639 --> 01:59:13,510
like again because if you solve only the

can i play with your robot yes please if

7182
01:59:16,390 --> 01:59:16,400
can i play with your robot yes please if

we just
 

7185
01:59:17,040 --> 01:59:18,950
we just
get our machines you know to just

7186
01:59:18,950 --> 01:59:18,960
get our machines you know to just
 

7187
01:59:18,960 --> 01:59:20,390
get our machines you know to just
blindly obey

this earth quite unique is that
it's home to conscious beings so you

7256
02:00:28,950 --> 02:00:28,960
it's home to conscious beings so you
 

7257
02:00:28,960 --> 02:00:31,589
it's home to conscious beings so you
mentioned consciousness

7258
02:00:31,589 --> 02:00:31,599
mentioned consciousness
 

7259
02:00:31,599 --> 02:00:34,950
mentioned consciousness
perhaps as a small aside

7260
02:00:34,950 --> 02:00:34,960
perhaps as a small aside
 

7261
02:00:34,960 --> 02:00:36,790
perhaps as a small aside
because we didn't really get specific to

7262
02:00:36,790 --> 02:00:36,800
because we didn't really get specific to
 

7263
02:00:36,800 --> 02:00:38,390
because we didn't really get specific to
what how we might

7264
02:00:38,390 --> 02:00:38,400
what how we might
 

7265
02:00:38,400 --> 02:00:40,310
what how we might
do the alignment like you said it's just

7266
02:00:40,310 --> 02:00:40,320
do the alignment like you said it's just
 

7267
02:00:40,320 --> 02:00:41,910
do the alignment like you said it's just
a really important research problem but

7268
02:00:41,910 --> 02:00:41,920
a really important research problem but
 

7269
02:00:41,920 --> 02:00:42,390
a really important research problem but
yeah

7270
02:00:42,390 --> 02:00:42,400
yeah
 

7271
02:00:42,400 --> 02:00:44,709
yeah
do you think engineering consciousness

7272
02:00:44,709 --> 02:00:44,719
do you think engineering consciousness
 

7273
02:00:44,719 --> 02:00:46,229
do you think engineering consciousness
into ai systems

7274
02:00:46,229 --> 02:00:46,239
into ai systems
 

7275
02:00:46,239 --> 02:00:49,830
into ai systems
is is a a possibility

7276
02:00:49,830 --> 02:00:49,840
is is a a possibility
 

7277
02:00:49,840 --> 02:00:52,709
is is a a possibility
it's something that we might to one day

7278
02:00:52,709 --> 02:00:52,719
it's something that we might to one day
 

7279
02:00:52,719 --> 02:00:55,270
it's something that we might to one day
do or is there something

7280
02:00:55,270 --> 02:00:55,280
do or is there something
 

7281
02:00:55,280 --> 02:00:58,229
do or is there something
fundamental to consciousness that is uh

7282
02:00:58,229 --> 02:00:58,239
fundamental to consciousness that is uh
 

7283
02:00:58,239 --> 02:00:59,750
fundamental to consciousness that is uh
is there something about consciousness

7284
02:00:59,750 --> 02:00:59,760
is there something about consciousness
 

7285
02:00:59,760 --> 02:01:00,870
is there something about consciousness
that is fundamental to

7286
02:01:00,870 --> 02:01:00,880
that is fundamental to
 

7287
02:01:00,880 --> 02:01:03,750
that is fundamental to
humans and humans only i think it's

7288
02:01:03,750 --> 02:01:03,760
humans and humans only i think it's
 

7289
02:01:03,760 --> 02:01:04,550
humans and humans only i think it's
possible

7290
02:01:04,550 --> 02:01:04,560
possible
 

7291
02:01:04,560 --> 02:01:07,510
possible
i think both consciousness and

7292
02:01:07,510 --> 02:01:07,520
i think both consciousness and
 

7293
02:01:07,520 --> 02:01:08,310
i think both consciousness and
intelligence

7294
02:01:08,310 --> 02:01:08,320
intelligence
 

7295
02:01:08,320 --> 02:01:11,270

are information processing certain types

7296
02:01:11,270 --> 02:01:11,280
are information processing certain types
 

7297
02:01:11,280 --> 02:01:13,430
are information processing certain types

of information processing
 

7299
02:01:13,440 --> 02:01:15,830
of information processing
and that fundamentally it doesn't matter

7300
02:01:15,830 --> 02:01:15,840
and that fundamentally it doesn't matter
 

7301
02:01:15,840 --> 02:01:17,990
and that fundamentally it doesn't matter
whether the information is processed by

7302
02:01:17,990 --> 02:01:18,000
whether the information is processed by

of
 

7317
02:01:34,800 --> 02:01:36,709
of
you said consciousness is information

7318
02:01:36,709 --> 02:01:36,719
you said consciousness is information
 

7319
02:01:36,719 --> 02:01:38,790
you said consciousness is information
processing so meaning

you know i i think you had a quote of

you know i i think you had a quote of
 

7323
02:01:41,760 --> 02:01:42,950
you know i i think you had a quote of
something like

7324
02:01:42,950 --> 02:01:42,960
something like
 

7325
02:01:42,960 --> 02:01:46,229
something like
it's information uh

7326
02:01:46,229 --> 02:01:46,239
it's information uh
 

7327
02:01:46,239 --> 02:01:47,830
it's information uh
knowing itself that kind of thing i

7328

knowing itself that kind of thing i
 

7329
02:01:47,840 --> 02:01:49,750

we don't know exactly what those complex
 

7337
02:01:55,119 --> 02:01:57,830
we don't know exactly what those complex
ways are it's clear that

02:01:57,830 --> 02:01:57,840
ways are it's clear that
 

7339
02:01:57,840 --> 02:01:59,270
ways are it's clear that
most of the information processing in

most of the information processing in
 

7341
02:01:59,280 --> 02:02:01,589
most of the information processing in

02:02:02,480 --> 02:02:04,950
we're not
even aware of it right like for example

02:02:04,950 --> 02:02:04,960
even aware of it right like for example
 

7347
02:02:04,960 --> 02:02:05,510
even aware of it right like for example
um

7348
02:02:05,510 --> 02:02:05,520
um
 

7349
02:02:05,520 --> 02:02:06,870
um
you're not aware of your heartbeat

7350
02:02:06,870 --> 02:02:06,880
you're not aware of your heartbeat
 

7351
02:02:06,880 --> 02:02:08,390
you're not aware of your heartbeat
regulation right now even though it's

7353
02:02:08,400 --> 02:02:09,830

7355
02:02:09,840 --> 02:02:11,669

right it's just kind of doing its own

7356
02:02:11,669 --> 02:02:11,679
right it's just kind of doing its own
 

7357
02:02:11,679 --> 02:02:13,350
right it's just kind of doing its own

02:02:13,350 --> 02:02:13,360
thing when you go jogging
 

7359
02:02:13,360 --> 02:02:15,189
thing when you go jogging
you there's a lot of complicated stuff

7360
02:02:15,189 --> 02:02:15,199
you there's a lot of complicated stuff
 

7361
02:02:15,199 --> 02:02:17,990
you there's a lot of complicated stuff
about how you put your foot down and we

7362
02:02:17,990 --> 02:02:18,000
about how you put your foot down and we
 

7363
02:02:18,000 --> 02:02:19,589
about how you put your foot down and we
know it's hard that's why robots used to

7364
02:02:19,589 --> 02:02:19,599
know it's hard that's why robots used to
 

7365
02:02:19,599 --> 02:02:20,470
know it's hard that's why robots used to
fall over so much

7366
02:02:20,470 --> 02:02:20,480
fall over so much
 

7367
02:02:20,480 --> 02:02:22,790
fall over so much
but you're mostly unaware about it your

7368
02:02:22,790 --> 02:02:22,800
but you're mostly unaware about it your
 

7369
02:02:22,800 --> 02:02:23,669
but you're mostly unaware about it your
brain just

7370
02:02:23,669 --> 02:02:23,679
brain just
 

7371
02:02:23,679 --> 02:02:26,070
brain just
your ceo consciousness module just sends

7372
02:02:26,070 --> 02:02:26,080
your ceo consciousness module just sends
 

7373
02:02:26,080 --> 02:02:27,669
your ceo consciousness module just sends
an email hey you know i'm going to keep

7374
02:02:27,669 --> 02:02:27,679
an email hey you know i'm going to keep
 

7375
02:02:27,679 --> 02:02:29,430
an email hey you know i'm going to keep
drawing along this path yeah the rest is

7376
02:02:29,430 --> 02:02:29,440
drawing along this path yeah the rest is
 

7377
02:02:29,440 --> 02:02:31,430
drawing along this path yeah the rest is
on autopilot right

7378
02:02:31,430 --> 02:02:31,440
on autopilot right
 

7379
02:02:31,440 --> 02:02:33,270
on autopilot right
so most of it is not conscious but

7380
02:02:33,270 --> 02:02:33,280
so most of it is not conscious but
 

7381
02:02:33,280 --> 02:02:34,629
so most of it is not conscious but
somehow

7382
02:02:34,629 --> 02:02:34,639
somehow
 

7383
02:02:34,639 --> 02:02:36,229
somehow
there are some of the information

7384
02:02:36,229 --> 02:02:36,239
there are some of the information
 

7385
02:02:36,239 --> 02:02:38,229
there are some of the information
processing which is

7386
02:02:38,229 --> 02:02:38,239
processing which is
 

7387
02:02:38,239 --> 02:02:41,589
processing which is
we don't know what what exactly

7388
02:02:41,589 --> 02:02:41,599
we don't know what what exactly
 

7389
02:02:41,599 --> 02:02:44,390
we don't know what what exactly
i i think this is a science problem that

7390
02:02:44,390 --> 02:02:44,400
i i think this is a science problem that
 

7391
02:02:44,400 --> 02:02:45,990
i i think this is a science problem that
i hope one day

7392
02:02:45,990 --> 02:02:46,000
i hope one day
 

7393
02:02:46,000 --> 02:02:47,669
i hope one day
we'll have some equation for or

7394
02:02:47,669 --> 02:02:47,679
we'll have some equation for or
 

7395
02:02:47,679 --> 02:02:49,350
we'll have some equation for or
something so we can be able to build a

7396
02:02:49,350 --> 02:02:49,360
something so we can be able to build a
 

7397
02:02:49,360 --> 02:02:51,189
something so we can be able to build a
consciousness detector and say yeah here

7398
02:02:51,189 --> 02:02:51,199
consciousness detector and say yeah here
 

7399
02:02:51,199 --> 02:02:52,629
consciousness detector and say yeah here
there is some consciousness here there's

7400
02:02:52,629 --> 02:02:52,639
there is some consciousness here there's
 

7401
02:02:52,639 --> 02:02:53,750
there is some consciousness here there's
not

feeling pain or
 

7407
02:02:57,199 --> 02:02:59,669
feeling pain or
it's okay because it's not feeling pain

it's okay because it's not feeling pain
 

7409

it's okay because it's not feeling pain
right now we treat this as sort of just

02:03:01,189 --> 02:03:01,199
right now we treat this as sort of just

and maybe we'll choose to create helper

7466
02:04:02,629 --> 02:04:02,639
and maybe we'll choose to create helper
 

7467
02:04:02,639 --> 02:04:03,990
and maybe we'll choose to create helper
robots for the elderly that are

7468
02:04:03,990 --> 02:04:04,000
robots for the elderly that are
 

7469
02:04:04,000 --> 02:04:05,270
robots for the elderly that are
conscious so

7470
02:04:05,270 --> 02:04:05,280
conscious so
 

7471
02:04:05,280 --> 02:04:06,790
conscious so
so that people don't just feel creeped

7472
02:04:06,790 --> 02:04:06,800
so that people don't just feel creeped
 

7473
02:04:06,800 --> 02:04:08,550
so that people don't just feel creeped
out that the you know the robot is just

7474
02:04:08,550 --> 02:04:08,560
out that the you know the robot is just
 

7475
02:04:08,560 --> 02:04:10,069
out that the you know the robot is just
faking it

7476
02:04:10,069 --> 02:04:10,079
faking it
 

7477
02:04:10,079 --> 02:04:12,310
faking it
when it acts like it's sad or happy like

7478
02:04:12,310 --> 02:04:12,320
when it acts like it's sad or happy like
 

7479
02:04:12,320 --> 02:04:14,709
when it acts like it's sad or happy like
i said elderly i think everybody gets

7480
02:04:14,709 --> 02:04:14,719
i said elderly i think everybody gets
 

7481
02:04:14,719 --> 02:04:16,870
i said elderly i think everybody gets
pretty deeply lonely in this world

7482
02:04:16,870 --> 02:04:16,880
pretty deeply lonely in this world
 

7483
02:04:16,880 --> 02:04:18,709
pretty deeply lonely in this world
and uh so there's a place i think for

7484
02:04:18,709 --> 02:04:18,719
and uh so there's a place i think for
 

7485
02:04:18,719 --> 02:04:20,629
and uh so there's a place i think for
everybody to have a connection with

7486
02:04:20,629 --> 02:04:20,639
everybody to have a connection with
 

7487
02:04:20,639 --> 02:04:23,109
everybody to have a connection with
conscious beings whether they're human

7488
02:04:23,109 --> 02:04:23,119
conscious beings whether they're human
 

7489
02:04:23,119 --> 02:04:25,669
conscious beings whether they're human
or otherwise but i know for sure that i

7490
02:04:25,669 --> 02:04:25,679
or otherwise but i know for sure that i
 

7491
02:04:25,679 --> 02:04:26,790
or otherwise but i know for sure that i
would

7492
02:04:26,790 --> 02:04:26,800
would
 

7493
02:04:26,800 --> 02:04:29,189
would
if i had a robot if i was going to

7494
02:04:29,189 --> 02:04:29,199
if i had a robot if i was going to
 

7495
02:04:29,199 --> 02:04:30,950
if i had a robot if i was going to
develop any kind of personal

7496
02:04:30,950 --> 02:04:30,960
develop any kind of personal
 

7497
02:04:30,960 --> 02:04:33,109
develop any kind of personal
emotional connection with it i would be

7498
02:04:33,109 --> 02:04:33,119
emotional connection with it i would be
 

7499
02:04:33,119 --> 02:04:34,310
emotional connection with it i would be
very creeped out if i knew it in an

7500
02:04:34,310 --> 02:04:34,320
very creeped out if i knew it in an
 

7501
02:04:34,320 --> 02:04:35,589
very creeped out if i knew it in an
intellectual level that the whole thing

7502
02:04:35,589 --> 02:04:35,599
intellectual level that the whole thing
 

7503
02:04:35,599 --> 02:04:36,709
intellectual level that the whole thing
was just the fraud

7504
02:04:36,709 --> 02:04:36,719
was just the fraud
 

7505
02:04:36,719 --> 02:04:40,390
was just the fraud
now today you can buy a little talking

for it for a kid which will say things
 

7511
02:04:44,480 --> 02:04:45,990
for it for a kid which will say things
and the little child will often think

7512
02:04:45,990 --> 02:04:46,000
and the little child will often think
 

7513
02:04:46,000 --> 02:04:47,430
and the little child will often think
that this is actually conscious

7514
02:04:47,430 --> 02:04:47,440
that this is actually conscious
 

7515
02:04:47,440 --> 02:04:49,270
that this is actually conscious
yes and even real secrets to it that

7516
02:04:49,270 --> 02:04:49,280
yes and even real secrets to it that
 

7517
02:04:49,280 --> 02:04:50,709
yes and even real secrets to it that
then go on the internet and

7518
02:04:50,709 --> 02:04:50,719
then go on the internet and
 

7519
02:04:50,719 --> 02:04:52,790
then go on the internet and
with all sorts of creepy repercussions

7520
02:04:52,790 --> 02:04:52,800
with all sorts of creepy repercussions
 

7521
02:04:52,800 --> 02:04:54,069
with all sorts of creepy repercussions
uh you know

7522
02:04:54,069 --> 02:04:54,079
uh you know
 

7523
02:04:54,079 --> 02:04:56,790
uh you know
i would not want to be just hacked and

7524
02:04:56,790 --> 02:04:56,800
i would not want to be just hacked and
 

7525
02:04:56,800 --> 02:04:57,270
i would not want to be just hacked and
tricked

7526
02:04:57,270 --> 02:04:57,280
tricked
 

7527
02:04:57,280 --> 02:04:59,750
tricked
like this if i was going to be

7528
02:04:59,750 --> 02:04:59,760
like this if i was going to be
 

7529
02:04:59,760 --> 02:05:01,430
like this if i was going to be
developing real emotional connections

7530
02:05:01,430 --> 02:05:01,440
developing real emotional connections
 

7531
02:05:01,440 --> 02:05:02,069
developing real emotional connections
with

7532
02:05:02,069 --> 02:05:02,079
with
 

7533
02:05:02,079 --> 02:05:04,470
with
the robot i would want to know that this

7534
02:05:04,470 --> 02:05:04,480
the robot i would want to know that this
 

7535
02:05:04,480 --> 02:05:05,430
the robot i would want to know that this
is actually real

7536
02:05:05,430 --> 02:05:05,440
is actually real
 

7537
02:05:05,440 --> 02:05:07,990
is actually real
it's acting conscious acting happy

7538
02:05:07,990 --> 02:05:08,000
it's acting conscious acting happy
 

7539
02:05:08,000 --> 02:05:09,750
it's acting conscious acting happy
because it actually feels it

7540
02:05:09,750 --> 02:05:09,760
because it actually feels it
 

7541
02:05:09,760 --> 02:05:12,310
because it actually feels it
and i i think this is not sci-fi i think

7542
02:05:12,310 --> 02:05:12,320
and i i think this is not sci-fi i think
 

7543
02:05:12,320 --> 02:05:14,310
and i i think this is not sci-fi i think
it's possible to measure to come up with

7544
02:05:14,310 --> 02:05:14,320
it's possible to measure to come up with
 

7545
02:05:14,320 --> 02:05:16,390
it's possible to measure to come up with
tools and make after we understand the

7546
02:05:16,390 --> 02:05:16,400
tools and make after we understand the
 

7547
02:05:16,400 --> 02:05:17,510
tools and make after we understand the
science of consciousness

7548
02:05:17,510 --> 02:05:17,520
science of consciousness
 

7549
02:05:17,520 --> 02:05:19,109
science of consciousness
you're saying is we'll be able to come

7550
02:05:19,109 --> 02:05:19,119
you're saying is we'll be able to come
 

7551
02:05:19,119 --> 02:05:20,310
you're saying is we'll be able to come
up with tools that can measure

7552
02:05:20,310 --> 02:05:20,320
up with tools that can measure

kind of by definition if it is a

information processing that and we know

7566
02:05:32,149 --> 02:05:32,159
information processing that and we know
 

7567
02:05:32,159 --> 02:05:33,510
information processing that and we know
that some information processing is

that some information processing is
 

7569
02:05:33,520 --> 02:05:35,350
that some information processing is
conscious and some isn't well then there

is something there to be discovered with

is something there to be discovered with

02:05:36,639 --> 02:05:37,910
is something there to be discovered with

giulia tononi has stuck his neck out the
 

7577

giulia tononi has stuck his neck out the
farthest and written down some equations

7578
02:05:42,550 --> 02:05:42,560
farthest and written down some equations
 

7579
02:05:42,560 --> 02:05:44,790
farthest and written down some equations
for a theory maybe that's right maybe

7580
02:05:44,790 --> 02:05:44,800
for a theory maybe that's right maybe
 

7581
02:05:44,800 --> 02:05:45,589
for a theory maybe that's right maybe
it's wrong

it's wrong
 

7583
02:05:45,599 --> 02:05:48,069
it's wrong
we certainly don't know but i i applaud

7584
02:05:48,069 --> 02:05:48,079
we certainly don't know but i i applaud

that kind of efforts to
 

7587
02:05:49,520 --> 02:05:52,229
that kind of efforts to
sort of take this say this say this is

7588
02:05:52,229 --> 02:05:52,239
sort of take this say this say this is
 

7589
02:05:52,239 --> 02:05:53,030
sort of take this say this say this is
not just something

7590
02:05:53,030 --> 02:05:53,040
not just something
 

7591
02:05:53,040 --> 02:05:55,990
not just something

about but something we can

about but something we can
measure we can study and coming being

i think what we would probably choose to

02:06:02,229 --> 02:06:02,239
i think what we would probably choose to
 

7601
02:06:02,239 --> 02:06:03,990
i think what we would probably choose to
do as i said is if we cannot figure this

02:06:03,990 --> 02:06:04,000
do as i said is if we cannot figure this
 

7603

02:06:10,149 --> 02:06:10,159
what sort of consciousness
 

7609
02:06:10,159 --> 02:06:12,950
what sort of consciousness
if any we put in in different machines

is also just something the genes built

7790
02:08:59,350 --> 02:08:59,360
is also just something the genes built
 

7791
02:08:59,360 --> 02:09:01,510
is also just something the genes built
to copy themselves but so what

7792
02:09:01,510 --> 02:09:01,520
to copy themselves but so what
 

7793
02:09:01,520 --> 02:09:03,830
to copy themselves but so what
you know i'm grateful that yeah thanks

7794
02:09:03,830 --> 02:09:03,840
you know i'm grateful that yeah thanks
 

7795
02:09:03,840 --> 02:09:05,750
you know i'm grateful that yeah thanks
jeans for doing this but you know

02:09:05,750 --> 02:09:05,760
jeans for doing this but you know
 

7797
02:09:05,760 --> 02:09:07,510
jeans for doing this but you know
now it's my brain that's in charge here

7798
02:09:07,510 --> 02:09:07,520
now it's my brain that's in charge here
 

7799
02:09:07,520 --> 02:09:09,030
now it's my brain that's in charge here
and i'm gonna enjoy my conscious

7800
02:09:09,030 --> 02:09:09,040
and i'm gonna enjoy my conscious
 

7801
02:09:09,040 --> 02:09:10,390
and i'm gonna enjoy my conscious
experience thank you very much and not

7802
02:09:10,390 --> 02:09:10,400
experience thank you very much and not
 

7803
02:09:10,400 --> 02:09:12,310
experience thank you very much and not
just pistachio ice cream

7804
02:09:12,310 --> 02:09:12,320

actually richard feynman i think said

7814
02:09:22,709 --> 02:09:22,719
actually richard feynman i think said
 

7815
02:09:22,719 --> 02:09:23,350
actually richard feynman i think said
this

7816
02:09:23,350 --> 02:09:23,360
this
 

7817
02:09:23,360 --> 02:09:26,550
this
so well he he is also the guy you know

7818
02:09:26,550 --> 02:09:26,560
so well he he is also the guy you know
 

7819
02:09:26,560 --> 02:09:29,669
so well he he is also the guy you know
really got me into physics

7820
02:09:29,669 --> 02:09:29,679
really got me into physics
 

7821
02:09:29,679 --> 02:09:31,910
really got me into physics
some art friend said that oh science

7822
02:09:31,910 --> 02:09:31,920
some art friend said that oh science
 

7823
02:09:31,920 --> 02:09:32,709
some art friend said that oh science
kind of just

7824
02:09:32,709 --> 02:09:32,719
kind of just
 

7825
02:09:32,719 --> 02:09:35,270
kind of just
is the party pooper it kind of ruins the

7826
02:09:35,270 --> 02:09:35,280
is the party pooper it kind of ruins the
 

7827
02:09:35,280 --> 02:09:36,069
is the party pooper it kind of ruins the
fun right

7828
02:09:36,069 --> 02:09:36,079
fun right
 

7829
02:09:36,079 --> 02:09:38,870
fun right
when like you have a beautiful flowers

7830
02:09:38,870 --> 02:09:38,880
when like you have a beautiful flowers
 

7831
02:09:38,880 --> 02:09:39,589
when like you have a beautiful flowers
as the artist

7832
02:09:39,589 --> 02:09:39,599
as the artist
 

7833
02:09:39,599 --> 02:09:40,709
as the artist
and then the scientist is going to

7834
02:09:40,709 --> 02:09:40,719
and then the scientist is going to
 

7835
02:09:40,719 --> 02:09:42,470
and then the scientist is going to
deconstruct that into just a blob of

7836
02:09:42,470 --> 02:09:42,480
deconstruct that into just a blob of
 

7837
02:09:42,480 --> 02:09:44,229
deconstruct that into just a blob of
quarks and electrons and

7838
02:09:44,229 --> 02:09:44,239
quarks and electrons and
 

7839
02:09:44,239 --> 02:09:46,229
quarks and electrons and
and feynman just pushed back on that in

7840
02:09:46,229 --> 02:09:46,239
and feynman just pushed back on that in
 

7841
02:09:46,239 --> 02:09:47,350
and feynman just pushed back on that in
such a beautiful way

7842
02:09:47,350 --> 02:09:47,360
such a beautiful way
 

7843
02:09:47,360 --> 02:09:48,870
such a beautiful way
which i think also can be used to push

7844
02:09:48,870 --> 02:09:48,880
which i think also can be used to push
 

7845
02:09:48,880 --> 02:09:51,030
which i think also can be used to push
back and make you pre

7846
02:09:51,030 --> 02:09:51,040
back and make you pre
 

7847
02:09:51,040 --> 02:09:53,270
back and make you pre
not feel guilty about falling in love so

7848
02:09:53,270 --> 02:09:53,280
not feel guilty about falling in love so
 

7849
02:09:53,280 --> 02:09:54,950
not feel guilty about falling in love so
so here's what feynman basically said

7850
02:09:54,950 --> 02:09:54,960
so here's what feynman basically said
 

7851
02:09:54,960 --> 02:09:57,430
so here's what feynman basically said
he said his friend you know yeah i can

7852
02:09:57,430 --> 02:09:57,440
he said his friend you know yeah i can
 

7853
02:09:57,440 --> 02:09:57,990
he said his friend you know yeah i can
also

7854
02:09:57,990 --> 02:09:58,000
also
 

7855
02:09:58,000 --> 02:09:59,430
also
as a scientist see that this is a

7856
02:09:59,430 --> 02:09:59,440
as a scientist see that this is a
 

7857
02:09:59,440 --> 02:10:00,870
as a scientist see that this is a
beautiful flower thank you very much

7858
02:10:00,870 --> 02:10:00,880
beautiful flower thank you very much
 

7859
02:10:00,880 --> 02:10:01,430
beautiful flower thank you very much
maybe i'm

7860
02:10:01,430 --> 02:10:01,440
maybe i'm
 

7861
02:10:01,440 --> 02:10:03,109
maybe i'm
i can't draw as good a painting as you

7862
02:10:03,109 --> 02:10:03,119
i can't draw as good a painting as you
 

7863
02:10:03,119 --> 02:10:04,470
i can't draw as good a painting as you
because i'm not as talented an artist

7864
02:10:04,470 --> 02:10:04,480
because i'm not as talented an artist
 

7865
02:10:04,480 --> 02:10:05,189
because i'm not as talented an artist
but yeah

7866
02:10:05,189 --> 02:10:05,199
but yeah
 

7867
02:10:05,199 --> 02:10:07,030
but yeah
i can really see the beauty in it and it

7868
02:10:07,030 --> 02:10:07,040
i can really see the beauty in it and it
 

7869
02:10:07,040 --> 02:10:09,189
i can really see the beauty in it and it
just it also looks beautiful to me

7870
02:10:09,189 --> 02:10:09,199
just it also looks beautiful to me
 

7871
02:10:09,199 --> 02:10:11,189
just it also looks beautiful to me
but in addition to that fyman said as a

7872
02:10:11,189 --> 02:10:11,199
but in addition to that fyman said as a
 

7873
02:10:11,199 --> 02:10:14,069
but in addition to that fyman said as a
scientist i see even more beauty

7874
02:10:14,069 --> 02:10:14,079
scientist i see even more beauty
 

7875
02:10:14,079 --> 02:10:16,790
scientist i see even more beauty
that the artist did not see right

7876
02:10:16,790 --> 02:10:16,800
that the artist did not see right
 

7877
02:10:16,800 --> 02:10:18,069
that the artist did not see right
suppose this is the

7878
02:10:18,069 --> 02:10:18,079
suppose this is the
 

7879
02:10:18,079 --> 02:10:21,030
suppose this is the
a flower on a blossoming apple tree you

7880
02:10:21,030 --> 02:10:21,040
a flower on a blossoming apple tree you
 

7881
02:10:21,040 --> 02:10:22,709
a flower on a blossoming apple tree you
could say this tree

7882
02:10:22,709 --> 02:10:22,719
could say this tree
 

7883
02:10:22,719 --> 02:10:24,229
could say this tree
has more beauty in it than just the

7884
02:10:24,229 --> 02:10:24,239
has more beauty in it than just the
 

7885
02:10:24,239 --> 02:10:26,310
has more beauty in it than just the
fruit the colors and the fragrance

7886
02:10:26,310 --> 02:10:26,320
fruit the colors and the fragrance
 

7887
02:10:26,320 --> 02:10:29,030
fruit the colors and the fragrance
this tree is made of air if i'm in roads

7888
02:10:29,030 --> 02:10:29,040
this tree is made of air if i'm in roads
 

7889
02:10:29,040 --> 02:10:30,550
this tree is made of air if i'm in roads
this is one of my favorite flying quotes

7890
02:10:30,550 --> 02:10:30,560
this is one of my favorite flying quotes
 

7891
02:10:30,560 --> 02:10:31,189
this is one of my favorite flying quotes
ever

7892
02:10:31,189 --> 02:10:31,199
ever
 

7893
02:10:31,199 --> 02:10:33,589
ever
and it took the carbon out of the air

7894
02:10:33,589 --> 02:10:33,599
and it took the carbon out of the air
 

7895
02:10:33,599 --> 02:10:35,510
and it took the carbon out of the air
and bound it in using the flaming heat

7896
02:10:35,510 --> 02:10:35,520
and bound it in using the flaming heat
 

7897
02:10:35,520 --> 02:10:37,189
and bound it in using the flaming heat
of the sun you know to turn the air into

7898
02:10:37,189 --> 02:10:37,199
of the sun you know to turn the air into
 

7899
02:10:37,199 --> 02:10:38,550
of the sun you know to turn the air into
a tree

7900
02:10:38,550 --> 02:10:38,560
a tree
 

7901
02:10:38,560 --> 02:10:42,629
a tree
and when you burn logs in your fireplace

7902
02:10:42,629 --> 02:10:42,639
and when you burn logs in your fireplace
 

7903
02:10:42,639 --> 02:10:44,069
and when you burn logs in your fireplace
it's really beautiful to think that this

7904
02:10:44,069 --> 02:10:44,079
it's really beautiful to think that this
 

7905
02:10:44,079 --> 02:10:45,990
it's really beautiful to think that this
is being reversed now the

7906
02:10:45,990 --> 02:10:46,000
is being reversed now the
 

7907
02:10:46,000 --> 02:10:47,669
is being reversed now the
tree is going the wood is going back in

7908
02:10:47,669 --> 02:10:47,679
tree is going the wood is going back in
 

7909
02:10:47,679 --> 02:10:51,430
tree is going the wood is going back in
the air and this flaming beautiful

7910
02:10:51,430 --> 02:10:51,440
the air and this flaming beautiful
 

7911
02:10:51,440 --> 02:10:53,189
the air and this flaming beautiful
dance of the fire that the artist can

7912
02:10:53,189 --> 02:10:53,199
dance of the fire that the artist can
 

7913
02:10:53,199 --> 02:10:56,069
dance of the fire that the artist can
see is the flaming light of the sun that

7914
02:10:56,069 --> 02:10:56,079
see is the flaming light of the sun that
 

7915
02:10:56,079 --> 02:10:56,629
see is the flaming light of the sun that
was

7916
02:10:56,629 --> 02:10:56,639
was
 

7917
02:10:56,639 --> 02:10:59,109
was
bound in to turn the air into a tree and

7918
02:10:59,109 --> 02:10:59,119
bound in to turn the air into a tree and
 

7919
02:10:59,119 --> 02:10:59,990
bound in to turn the air into a tree and
then the ashes

7920
02:10:59,990 --> 02:11:00,000
then the ashes
 

7921
02:11:00,000 --> 02:11:01,990
then the ashes
is the little residue that didn't come

7922
02:11:01,990 --> 02:11:02,000
is the little residue that didn't come
 

7923
02:11:02,000 --> 02:11:03,430
is the little residue that didn't come
from the air that the tree sucked out of

7924
02:11:03,430 --> 02:11:03,440
from the air that the tree sucked out of
 

7925
02:11:03,440 --> 02:11:04,149
from the air that the tree sucked out of
the ground you know

7926
02:11:04,149 --> 02:11:04,159
the ground you know
 

7927
02:11:04,159 --> 02:11:06,069
the ground you know
feynman said these are beautiful things

7928
02:11:06,069 --> 02:11:06,079
feynman said these are beautiful things
 

7929
02:11:06,079 --> 02:11:07,589
feynman said these are beautiful things
and science just

7930
02:11:07,589 --> 02:11:07,599
and science just
 

7931
02:11:07,599 --> 02:11:10,629
and science just
adds it doesn't subtract and i i

7932
02:11:10,629 --> 02:11:10,639
adds it doesn't subtract and i i
 

7933
02:11:10,639 --> 02:11:12,790
adds it doesn't subtract and i i
feel exactly that way about love and

7934
02:11:12,790 --> 02:11:12,800
feel exactly that way about love and
 

7935
02:11:12,800 --> 02:11:15,830
feel exactly that way about love and
about pistachio ice cream also

7936
02:11:15,830 --> 02:11:15,840
about pistachio ice cream also
 

7937
02:11:15,840 --> 02:11:17,589
about pistachio ice cream also
i can understand that it even there is

7938
02:11:17,589 --> 02:11:17,599
i can understand that it even there is
 

7939
02:11:17,599 --> 02:11:19,750
i can understand that it even there is
even more nuance to the whole thing yeah

7940
02:11:19,750 --> 02:11:19,760
even more nuance to the whole thing yeah
 

7941
02:11:19,760 --> 02:11:20,310
even more nuance to the whole thing yeah
right

7942
02:11:20,310 --> 02:11:20,320
right
 

7943
02:11:20,320 --> 02:11:23,189
right
at this very visceral level you can fall

7944
02:11:23,189 --> 02:11:23,199
at this very visceral level you can fall
 

7945
02:11:23,199 --> 02:11:24,550
at this very visceral level you can fall
in love just as much as someone who

7946
02:11:24,550 --> 02:11:24,560
in love just as much as someone who
 

7947
02:11:24,560 --> 02:11:27,510
in love just as much as someone who
knows nothing about neuroscience

7948
02:11:27,510 --> 02:11:27,520
knows nothing about neuroscience

a theory of physics that unifies
 

8113
02:14:14,719 --> 02:14:17,750
a theory of physics that unifies
all the laws of physics yeah i think

8114
02:14:17,750 --> 02:14:17,760
all the laws of physics yeah i think
 

8115
02:14:17,760 --> 02:14:19,830
all the laws of physics yeah i think
it's absolutely absolutely possible

8116
02:14:19,830 --> 02:14:19,840
it's absolutely absolutely possible
 

8117
02:14:19,840 --> 02:14:21,510
it's absolutely absolutely possible
i think it's it's very clear that we're

8118
02:14:21,510 --> 02:14:21,520
i think it's it's very clear that we're
 

8119
02:14:21,520 --> 02:14:24,790
i think it's it's very clear that we're
going to see a great boost to science

8120
02:14:24,790 --> 02:14:24,800
going to see a great boost to science
 

8121
02:14:24,800 --> 02:14:26,629
going to see a great boost to science
we're already seeing a boost actually

8122
02:14:26,629 --> 02:14:26,639
we're already seeing a boost actually
 

8123
02:14:26,639 --> 02:14:27,910
we're already seeing a boost actually
from from machine learning helping

8124
02:14:27,910 --> 02:14:27,920
from from machine learning helping

alpha fold was an example you know the

8128
02:14:31,270 --> 02:14:31,280
alpha fold was an example you know the
 

8129
02:14:31,280 --> 02:14:34,470
alpha fold was an example you know the
decades-old protein folding problem

8130
02:14:34,470 --> 02:14:34,480
decades-old protein folding problem
 

8131
02:14:34,480 --> 02:14:37,589
decades-old protein folding problem
so and gradually yeah unless we go

8132
02:14:37,589 --> 02:14:37,599
so and gradually yeah unless we go
 

8133
02:14:37,599 --> 02:14:39,189
so and gradually yeah unless we go
extinct by doing something dumb like we

8134
02:14:39,189 --> 02:14:39,199
extinct by doing something dumb like we
 

8135
02:14:39,199 --> 02:14:40,310
extinct by doing something dumb like we
discussed i think

8136
02:14:40,310 --> 02:14:40,320
discussed i think
 

8137
02:14:40,320 --> 02:14:43,350
discussed i think
it's um

8138
02:14:43,350 --> 02:14:43,360

 

8139
02:14:43,360 --> 02:14:45,750

very likely that our understanding of

8140
02:14:45,750 --> 02:14:45,760
very likely that our understanding of
 

8141
02:14:45,760 --> 02:14:48,069
very likely that our understanding of
physics will become so good

8142
02:14:48,069 --> 02:14:48,079
physics will become so good
 

8143
02:14:48,079 --> 02:14:52,310
physics will become so good
that uh our technology will no longer

8144
02:14:52,310 --> 02:14:52,320
that uh our technology will no longer
 

8145
02:14:52,320 --> 02:14:55,270
that uh our technology will no longer
be limited by human intelligence but

8146
02:14:55,270 --> 02:14:55,280
be limited by human intelligence but
 

8147
02:14:55,280 --> 02:14:56,709
be limited by human intelligence but
instead be limited by the laws of

8148
02:14:56,709 --> 02:14:56,719
instead be limited by the laws of
 

8149
02:14:56,719 --> 02:14:58,069
instead be limited by the laws of
physics

8150
02:14:58,069 --> 02:14:58,079
physics
 

8151
02:14:58,079 --> 02:15:00,310
physics
so our tech today is limited by what

8152
02:15:00,310 --> 02:15:00,320
so our tech today is limited by what
 

8153
02:15:00,320 --> 02:15:02,229
so our tech today is limited by what
we've been able to invent right

8154
02:15:02,229 --> 02:15:02,239
we've been able to invent right
 

8155
02:15:02,239 --> 02:15:05,350
we've been able to invent right
i think as i ai progresses it'll just be

8156
02:15:05,350 --> 02:15:05,360
i think as i ai progresses it'll just be
 

8157
02:15:05,360 --> 02:15:07,109
i think as i ai progresses it'll just be
limited by the speed of light

8158
02:15:07,109 --> 02:15:07,119
limited by the speed of light
 

8159
02:15:07,119 --> 02:15:09,510
limited by the speed of light
and other physical limits which would

8160
02:15:09,510 --> 02:15:09,520
and other physical limits which would
 

8161
02:15:09,520 --> 02:15:11,189
and other physical limits which would
mean

8162
02:15:11,189 --> 02:15:11,199
mean
 

8163
02:15:11,199 --> 02:15:13,030
mean
it's going to be just dramatically

8164
02:15:13,030 --> 02:15:13,040
it's going to be just dramatically
 

8165
02:15:13,040 --> 02:15:15,189
it's going to be just dramatically
beyond you know where we are now

02:15:15,189 --> 02:15:15,199
beyond you know where we are now
 

8167
02:15:15,199 --> 02:15:16,709
beyond you know where we are now
do you think it's a fundamentally

8168
02:15:16,709 --> 02:15:16,719
do you think it's a fundamentally
 

8169
02:15:16,719 --> 02:15:18,470
do you think it's a fundamentally
mathematical pursuit

8170
02:15:18,470 --> 02:15:18,480
mathematical pursuit
 

8171
02:15:18,480 --> 02:15:22,149
mathematical pursuit
of trying to understand like the laws of

02:15:22,149 --> 02:15:22,159
of trying to understand like the laws of

02:15:22,159 --> 02:15:22,550
of trying to understand like the laws of

02:15:22,560 --> 02:15:24,550
this
that govern our universe from a

that govern our universe from a

02:15:24,560 --> 02:15:26,629
that govern our universe from a

like theorems and those those kinds of
 

8183
02:15:32,480 --> 02:15:36,550
like theorems and those those kinds of
things or is there some other

8189
02:15:39,599 --> 02:15:41,589

02:15:41,589 --> 02:15:41,599
more sort of empirical ideas they're
 

8191
02:15:41,599 --> 02:15:43,270
more sort of empirical ideas they're
both i would say

8192
02:15:43,270 --> 02:15:43,280
both i would say
 

8193
02:15:43,280 --> 02:15:45,189
both i would say
it's really interesting to look out at

so here we come out with this big new

8200
02:15:49,350 --> 02:15:49,360
so here we come out with this big new
 

8201
02:15:49,360 --> 02:15:51,350
so here we come out with this big new
hammer it says machine learning on it

02:15:51,350 --> 02:15:51,360
hammer it says machine learning on it
 

8203
02:15:51,360 --> 02:15:52,310
hammer it says machine learning on it
and ask you know

8204
02:15:52,310 --> 02:15:52,320
and ask you know
 

8205
02:15:52,320 --> 02:15:53,589
and ask you know
where are there some nails that you can

8206
02:15:53,589 --> 02:15:53,599
where are there some nails that you can
 

8207
02:15:53,599 --> 02:15:56,550
where are there some nails that you can
help with here that you can hammer

8208
02:15:56,550 --> 02:15:56,560
help with here that you can hammer
 

8209
02:15:56,560 --> 02:15:59,750
help with here that you can hammer
ultimately if machine learning gets the

8210
02:15:59,750 --> 02:15:59,760
ultimately if machine learning gets the
 

8211
02:15:59,760 --> 02:16:01,669
ultimately if machine learning gets the
point that it can do everything

8212
02:16:01,669 --> 02:16:01,679
point that it can do everything
 

8213
02:16:01,679 --> 02:16:03,510
point that it can do everything
better than us it will be able to help

8214
02:16:03,510 --> 02:16:03,520
better than us it will be able to help
 

8215
02:16:03,520 --> 02:16:05,350
better than us it will be able to help
across the whole space of

8216
02:16:05,350 --> 02:16:05,360
across the whole space of
 

8217
02:16:05,360 --> 02:16:06,950
across the whole space of
of science but maybe we can anchor it by

8218
02:16:06,950 --> 02:16:06,960
of science but maybe we can anchor it by
 

8219
02:16:06,960 --> 02:16:08,709
of science but maybe we can anchor it by
starting a little bit right now near

8220
02:16:08,709 --> 02:16:08,719
starting a little bit right now near
 

8221
02:16:08,719 --> 02:16:09,189
starting a little bit right now near
term

8222
02:16:09,189 --> 02:16:09,199
term
 

8223
02:16:09,199 --> 02:16:12,069
term
and see how we kind of move forward so

8224
02:16:12,069 --> 02:16:12,079
and see how we kind of move forward so
 

8225
02:16:12,079 --> 02:16:14,149
and see how we kind of move forward so
so like right now

8226
02:16:14,149 --> 02:16:14,159
so like right now
 

8227
02:16:14,159 --> 02:16:16,229
so like right now
first of all you have a lot of big data

an enormous boost also
 

8277
02:17:05,599 --> 02:17:07,830

so um we had to do all our computations

8278
02:17:07,830 --> 02:17:07,840
so um we had to do all our computations
 

8279
02:17:07,840 --> 02:17:09,349
so um we had to do all our computations
by hand right

8280
02:17:09,349 --> 02:17:09,359
by hand right
 

8281

8289
02:17:18,559 --> 02:17:21,750
long time it would have taken to do
simple stuff then we started to get

8290
02:17:21,750 --> 02:17:21,760
simple stuff then we started to get
 

8291
02:17:21,760 --> 02:17:23,589
simple stuff then we started to get
little calculators and computers that

8292
02:17:23,589 --> 02:17:23,599

then work with and test and explore and
 

8601
02:22:47,680 --> 02:22:51,030
then work with and test and explore and
uh you asked a really good question also

uh you asked a really good question also
 

8603
02:22:51,040 --> 02:22:52,790
uh you asked a really good question also
about if this is sort of a search

is it
maybe it's not right we thought that

you brought up alpha zero because that's

8768
02:25:38,870 --> 02:25:38,880
you brought up alpha zero because that's
 

8769
02:25:38,880 --> 02:25:39,910
you brought up alpha zero because that's
the counter example

the counter example
 

8771
02:25:39,920 --> 02:25:41,110

02:25:41,110 --> 02:25:41,120
it turned out we were flattering
 

8773
02:25:41,120 --> 02:25:43,270
it turned out we were flattering
ourselves when we said

there was some pro humans had programmed
 

8801
02:26:10,640 --> 02:26:11,910
there was some pro humans had programmed

02:26:11,920 --> 02:26:13,510
in some intuition
after humans had played a lot of games

they told the computer you know
count the pawn as one point the bishop

8808
02:26:17,429 --> 02:26:17,439
count the pawn as one point the bishop
 

8809
02:26:17,439 --> 02:26:18,710
count the pawn as one point the bishop
is three points

8810
02:26:18,710 --> 02:26:18,720
is three points
 

8811
02:26:18,720 --> 02:26:20,630
is three points
rook is five points and so on you add it

8812
02:26:20,630 --> 02:26:20,640
rook is five points and so on you add it
 

8813
02:26:20,640 --> 02:26:22,070
rook is five points and so on you add it
all up and then you add some extra

8814
02:26:22,070 --> 02:26:22,080
all up and then you add some extra
 

8815
02:26:22,080 --> 02:26:23,590
all up and then you add some extra
points for past pawns and

8816
02:26:23,590 --> 02:26:23,600
points for past pawns and
 

8817
02:26:23,600 --> 02:26:26,230
points for past pawns and
subtract if the opponent has it and and

8818
02:26:26,230 --> 02:26:26,240

blah blah blah blah
 

8821
02:26:28,240 --> 02:26:30,550
blah blah blah blah
and then what what deep blue did was

8822
02:26:30,550 --> 02:26:30,560
and then what what deep blue did was
 

8823
02:26:30,560 --> 02:26:32,469
and then what what deep blue did was
just search

8824
02:26:32,469 --> 02:26:32,479
just search
 

8825
02:26:32,479 --> 02:26:34,309
just search
just very brute force tried many many

8826
02:26:34,309 --> 02:26:34,319
just very brute force tried many many
 

8827
02:26:34,319 --> 02:26:35,910
just very brute force tried many many
moves ahead all these combinations and

8828
02:26:35,910 --> 02:26:35,920
moves ahead all these combinations and

moves ahead all these combinations and
the pruned research

8830
02:26:37,349 --> 02:26:37,359
the pruned research
 

8831
02:26:37,359 --> 02:26:39,349
the pruned research
and it could think much faster than

8832
02:26:39,349 --> 02:26:39,359
and it could think much faster than
 

8833
02:26:39,359 --> 02:26:40,950
and it could think much faster than
kasparov and it won

8834
02:26:40,950 --> 02:26:40,960
kasparov and it won
 

8835
02:26:40,960 --> 02:26:43,990
kasparov and it won
right and that i think

8836
02:26:43,990 --> 02:26:44,000
right and that i think
 

8837
02:26:44,000 --> 02:26:46,150
right and that i think
inflated our egos in a way it shouldn't

8838
02:26:46,150 --> 02:26:46,160
inflated our egos in a way it shouldn't
 

8839
02:26:46,160 --> 02:26:47,590
inflated our egos in a way it shouldn't
have because people started to say

8840
02:26:47,590 --> 02:26:47,600
have because people started to say
 

8841
02:26:47,600 --> 02:26:49,830
have because people started to say
yeah yeah it's just brute force search

8842
02:26:49,830 --> 02:26:49,840
yeah yeah it's just brute force search
 

8843
02:26:49,840 --> 02:26:52,230
yeah yeah it's just brute force search
but has no intuition yeah

8844
02:26:52,230 --> 02:26:52,240
but has no intuition yeah
 

8845
02:26:52,240 --> 02:26:55,750
but has no intuition yeah
alpha zero really

8846

8847
02:26:55,760 --> 02:26:58,950

popped our bubble there yeah because

8848
02:26:58,950 --> 02:26:58,960
popped our bubble there yeah because
 

8849
02:26:58,960 --> 02:27:01,910
popped our bubble there yeah because
what alpha zero does yes it does also do

8850
02:27:01,910 --> 02:27:01,920
what alpha zero does yes it does also do
 

8851
02:27:01,920 --> 02:27:02,389
what alpha zero does yes it does also do
some of that

some of that
 

8853
02:27:02,399 --> 02:27:05,349
some of that
research but it also has this intuition

it's very heavily guided of course i
don't sit and try all random strings i

8922
02:28:14,309 --> 02:28:14,319
don't sit and try all random strings i
 

8923
02:28:14,319 --> 02:28:16,150
don't sit and try all random strings i
have a hunch that you know

8924
02:28:16,150 --> 02:28:16,160
have a hunch that you know
 

8925
02:28:16,160 --> 02:28:18,070
have a hunch that you know
this reminds me a little bit about this

8926
02:28:18,070 --> 02:28:18,080
this reminds me a little bit about this
 

8927
02:28:18,080 --> 02:28:19,270
this reminds me a little bit about this
other proof i've seen

8928
02:28:19,270 --> 02:28:19,280
other proof i've seen
 

8929
02:28:19,280 --> 02:28:21,030
other proof i've seen
for this thing so maybe i first what if

8930
02:28:21,030 --> 02:28:21,040
for this thing so maybe i first what if
 

8931
02:28:21,040 --> 02:28:22,469
for this thing so maybe i first what if
i try this

8932
02:28:22,469 --> 02:28:22,479
i try this
 

8933
02:28:22,479 --> 02:28:24,950
i try this
nah that didn't work out but but this

8934
02:28:24,950 --> 02:28:24,960
nah that didn't work out but but this
 

8935
02:28:24,960 --> 02:28:26,309
nah that didn't work out but but this
reminds me actually the way this

8936
02:28:26,309 --> 02:28:26,319
reminds me actually the way this
 

8937
02:28:26,319 --> 02:28:29,110
reminds me actually the way this
failed reminds me of that and so so

8938
02:28:29,110 --> 02:28:29,120
failed reminds me of that and so so
 

8939
02:28:29,120 --> 02:28:30,550
failed reminds me of that and so so
combining the intuition

8940
02:28:30,550 --> 02:28:30,560
combining the intuition
 

8941
02:28:30,560 --> 02:28:33,830
combining the intuition
that with all these brute force

8942
02:28:33,830 --> 02:28:33,840
that with all these brute force
 

8943
02:28:33,840 --> 02:28:37,030
that with all these brute force
capabilities i think i think it's going

8944
02:28:37,030 --> 02:28:37,040
capabilities i think i think it's going
 

8945
02:28:37,040 --> 02:28:38,469
capabilities i think i think it's going
to be able to help physics too

8946
02:28:38,469 --> 02:28:38,479
to be able to help physics too
 

8947
02:28:38,479 --> 02:28:40,309
to be able to help physics too
do you think that there will be a day

8948
02:28:40,309 --> 02:28:40,319
do you think that there will be a day
 

8949
02:28:40,319 --> 02:28:42,870
do you think that there will be a day
when an ai system

8950
02:28:42,870 --> 02:28:42,880
when an ai system
 

8951
02:28:42,880 --> 02:28:45,349
when an ai system
being the primary contributor let's say

8952
02:28:45,349 --> 02:28:45,359
being the primary contributor let's say
 

8953
02:28:45,359 --> 02:28:46,070
being the primary contributor let's say
90

8954
02:28:46,070 --> 02:28:46,080
90
 

8955
02:28:46,080 --> 02:28:50,389
90
plus wins the nobel prize in physics

8956
02:28:50,389 --> 02:28:50,399

 

8957
02:28:50,399 --> 02:28:51,830

obviously they'll give it to the humans

8958
02:28:51,830 --> 02:28:51,840
obviously they'll give it to the humans
 

8959
02:28:51,840 --> 02:28:53,270
obviously they'll give it to the humans
because we humans don't like to give

8960
02:28:53,270 --> 02:28:53,280
because we humans don't like to give
 

8961
02:28:53,280 --> 02:28:54,710
because we humans don't like to give
prizes to machines

8962
02:28:54,710 --> 02:28:54,720
prizes to machines
 

8963
02:28:54,720 --> 02:28:56,309
prizes to machines
it'll give it'll give it to the humans

8964
02:28:56,309 --> 02:28:56,319
it'll give it'll give it to the humans
 

8965
02:28:56,319 --> 02:28:58,389
it'll give it'll give it to the humans
behind the system you could argue that

8966
02:28:58,389 --> 02:28:58,399
behind the system you could argue that
 

8967
02:28:58,399 --> 02:29:00,469
behind the system you could argue that
ai has already been involved in some

8968
02:29:00,469 --> 02:29:00,479
ai has already been involved in some
 

8969
02:29:00,479 --> 02:29:02,070
ai has already been involved in some
nobel prizes probably maybe something

8970
02:29:02,070 --> 02:29:02,080
nobel prizes probably maybe something
 

8971
02:29:02,080 --> 02:29:03,590
nobel prizes probably maybe something
with black holes and stuff like that

8972
02:29:03,590 --> 02:29:03,600
with black holes and stuff like that
 

8973
02:29:03,600 --> 02:29:06,150
with black holes and stuff like that
yeah we don't like giving prizes to

8974
02:29:06,150 --> 02:29:06,160
yeah we don't like giving prizes to
 

8975
02:29:06,160 --> 02:29:07,110
yeah we don't like giving prizes to
other life forms

8976
02:29:07,110 --> 02:29:07,120
other life forms
 

8977
02:29:07,120 --> 02:29:09,590
other life forms
if someone wins a horse racing contest

8978
02:29:09,590 --> 02:29:09,600
if someone wins a horse racing contest
 

8979
02:29:09,600 --> 02:29:10,950
if someone wins a horse racing contest
they don't give the price the horse

8980
02:29:10,950 --> 02:29:10,960
they don't give the price the horse
 

8981
02:29:10,960 --> 02:29:12,950
they don't give the price the horse
either it's true

8982
02:29:12,950 --> 02:29:12,960
either it's true
 

8983
02:29:12,960 --> 02:29:15,429
either it's true
uh but do you think that's we might be

8984
02:29:15,429 --> 02:29:15,439
uh but do you think that's we might be
 

8985
02:29:15,439 --> 02:29:17,190
uh but do you think that's we might be
able to see something like that in our

8986
02:29:17,190 --> 02:29:17,200
able to see something like that in our
 

8987
02:29:17,200 --> 02:29:18,550
able to see something like that in our
lifetimes when

8988
02:29:18,550 --> 02:29:18,560
lifetimes when
 

8989
02:29:18,560 --> 02:29:21,750
lifetimes when
ai so like the first system i would say

8990
02:29:21,750 --> 02:29:21,760
ai so like the first system i would say
 

8991
02:29:21,760 --> 02:29:21,990
ai so like the first system i would say
that

8992
02:29:21,990 --> 02:29:22,000
that
 

8993
02:29:22,000 --> 02:29:24,230
that
makes us think about a nobel prize

8994
02:29:24,230 --> 02:29:24,240
makes us think about a nobel prize
 

8995
02:29:24,240 --> 02:29:25,270
makes us think about a nobel prize
seriously

8996
02:29:25,270 --> 02:29:25,280
seriously
 

8997
02:29:25,280 --> 02:29:27,910
seriously
is like alpha fold is making us think

8998
02:29:27,910 --> 02:29:27,920
is like alpha fold is making us think
 

8999
02:29:27,920 --> 02:29:28,710
is like alpha fold is making us think
about

9000
02:29:28,710 --> 02:29:28,720
about
 

9001
02:29:28,720 --> 02:29:31,830
about
in medicine physiology a nobel prize

9002
02:29:31,830 --> 02:29:31,840
in medicine physiology a nobel prize
 

9003
02:29:31,840 --> 02:29:33,590
in medicine physiology a nobel prize
perhaps discoveries that are direct

9004
02:29:33,590 --> 02:29:33,600
perhaps discoveries that are direct
 

9005
02:29:33,600 --> 02:29:35,910
perhaps discoveries that are direct
result of something that's discovered by

9006
02:29:35,910 --> 02:29:35,920
result of something that's discovered by
 

9007
02:29:35,920 --> 02:29:38,710
result of something that's discovered by
alpha fall do you think in physics

9008
02:29:38,710 --> 02:29:38,720
alpha fall do you think in physics
 

9009
02:29:38,720 --> 02:29:40,389
alpha fall do you think in physics
we might be able to see that in our

9010
02:29:40,389 --> 02:29:40,399
we might be able to see that in our
 

9011
02:29:40,399 --> 02:29:42,309
we might be able to see that in our
lifetimes i think

9012
02:29:42,309 --> 02:29:42,319
lifetimes i think
 

9013
02:29:42,319 --> 02:29:43,670
lifetimes i think
what's probably going to happen is more

9014
02:29:43,670 --> 02:29:43,680
what's probably going to happen is more
 

9015
02:29:43,680 --> 02:29:46,870
what's probably going to happen is more
of a blurring of the distinctions

9016
02:29:46,870 --> 02:29:46,880
of a blurring of the distinctions
 

9017
02:29:46,880 --> 02:29:50,469
of a blurring of the distinctions
so today

9018
02:29:50,469 --> 02:29:50,479
so today
 

9019
02:29:50,479 --> 02:29:53,270
so today
if somebody uses a computer to do a

9020
02:29:53,270 --> 02:29:53,280
if somebody uses a computer to do a
 

9021
02:29:53,280 --> 02:29:54,630
if somebody uses a computer to do a
computation that gives them the normal

9022
02:29:54,630 --> 02:29:54,640
computation that gives them the normal
 

9023
02:29:54,640 --> 02:29:56,070
computation that gives them the normal
price nobody's going to dream of giving

9024
02:29:56,070 --> 02:29:56,080
price nobody's going to dream of giving
 

9025
02:29:56,080 --> 02:29:57,190
price nobody's going to dream of giving
the price to the computer they're going

9026
02:29:57,190 --> 02:29:57,200
the price to the computer they're going
 

9027
02:29:57,200 --> 02:29:58,870
the price to the computer they're going
to be like that was just a tool

9028
02:29:58,870 --> 02:29:58,880
to be like that was just a tool
 

9029
02:29:58,880 --> 02:30:02,230
to be like that was just a tool
i i think for these things also people

9030
02:30:02,230 --> 02:30:02,240
i i think for these things also people
 

9031
02:30:02,240 --> 02:30:03,429
i i think for these things also people
are just going to

9032
02:30:03,429 --> 02:30:03,439
are just going to
 

9033
02:30:03,439 --> 02:30:05,349
are just going to
for a long time view the computer as a

9034
02:30:05,349 --> 02:30:05,359
for a long time view the computer as a
 

9035
02:30:05,359 --> 02:30:06,870
for a long time view the computer as a
tool but what's going to

9036
02:30:06,870 --> 02:30:06,880
tool but what's going to
 

9037
02:30:06,880 --> 02:30:09,270
tool but what's going to
change is that as the ubiqui the

9038
02:30:09,270 --> 02:30:09,280
change is that as the ubiqui the
 

9039
02:30:09,280 --> 02:30:10,230
change is that as the ubiqui the
ubiquity of

9040
02:30:10,230 --> 02:30:10,240
ubiquity of
 

9041
02:30:10,240 --> 02:30:14,469
ubiquity of
of machine learning i think

9042
02:30:14,469 --> 02:30:14,479

 

9043
02:30:14,479 --> 02:30:18,710

at some point in my lifetime finding a

9044
02:30:18,710 --> 02:30:18,720
at some point in my lifetime finding a
 

9045
02:30:18,720 --> 02:30:21,429
at some point in my lifetime finding a
human physicist who knows nothing about

9046
02:30:21,429 --> 02:30:21,439
human physicist who knows nothing about
 

9047
02:30:21,439 --> 02:30:23,030
human physicist who knows nothing about
machine learning is going to be about

9048
02:30:23,030 --> 02:30:23,040
machine learning is going to be about
 

9049
02:30:23,040 --> 02:30:24,070
machine learning is going to be about
almost as hard as

9050
02:30:24,070 --> 02:30:24,080
almost as hard as
 

9051
02:30:24,080 --> 02:30:25,830
almost as hard as
it is today finding a human physicist

9052
02:30:25,830 --> 02:30:25,840
it is today finding a human physicist
 

9053
02:30:25,840 --> 02:30:27,510
it is today finding a human physicist
who doesn't says oh i don't know

9054
02:30:27,510 --> 02:30:27,520
who doesn't says oh i don't know
 

9055
02:30:27,520 --> 02:30:28,790
who doesn't says oh i don't know
anything about computers

9056
02:30:28,790 --> 02:30:28,800
anything about computers
 

9057
02:30:28,800 --> 02:30:31,110
anything about computers
right or i don't use math it would just

9058
02:30:31,110 --> 02:30:31,120
right or i don't use math it would just
 

9059
02:30:31,120 --> 02:30:33,830
right or i don't use math it would just
be a ridiculous concept

9060
02:30:33,830 --> 02:30:33,840
be a ridiculous concept
 

9061
02:30:33,840 --> 02:30:36,950
be a ridiculous concept
you see but the thing is there is a

9062
02:30:36,950 --> 02:30:36,960
you see but the thing is there is a
 

9063
02:30:36,960 --> 02:30:38,150
you see but the thing is there is a
magic moment though

9064
02:30:38,150 --> 02:30:38,160
magic moment though
 

9065
02:30:38,160 --> 02:30:41,190
magic moment though
like with alpha zero when the system

9066
02:30:41,190 --> 02:30:41,200
like with alpha zero when the system
 

9067
02:30:41,200 --> 02:30:44,070
like with alpha zero when the system
surprises us in a way where the best

9068
02:30:44,070 --> 02:30:44,080
surprises us in a way where the best
 

9069
02:30:44,080 --> 02:30:46,710
surprises us in a way where the best
people in the world

9070
02:30:46,710 --> 02:30:46,720
people in the world
 

9071
02:30:46,720 --> 02:30:49,030
people in the world
truly learn something from the system in

9072
02:30:49,030 --> 02:30:49,040
truly learn something from the system in
 

9073
02:30:49,040 --> 02:30:49,750
truly learn something from the system in
a way where

9074
02:30:49,750 --> 02:30:49,760
a way where
 

9075
02:30:49,760 --> 02:30:52,389
a way where
you feel like it's another entity yeah

9076
02:30:52,389 --> 02:30:52,399
you feel like it's another entity yeah
 

9077
02:30:52,399 --> 02:30:53,590
you feel like it's another entity yeah
like the way people

9078
02:30:53,590 --> 02:30:53,600
like the way people
 

9079
02:30:53,600 --> 02:30:55,510
like the way people
the way magnus carlsen the way certain

9080
02:30:55,510 --> 02:30:55,520
the way magnus carlsen the way certain
 

9081
02:30:55,520 --> 02:30:57,190
the way magnus carlsen the way certain

02:31:02,150 --> 02:31:02,160
it's like uh it it truly is no longer a
 

9087
02:31:02,160 --> 02:31:02,870
it's like uh it it truly is no longer a

9088
02:31:02,870 --> 02:31:02,880
tool
 

9089
02:31:02,880 --> 02:31:05,429
tool
in the in the sense that it doesn't feel

like a tool
 

9093
02:31:06,560 --> 02:31:09,270
like a tool
it feels like some other entity so

9094
02:31:09,270 --> 02:31:09,280
it feels like some other entity so
 

9095
02:31:09,280 --> 02:31:11,349
it feels like some other entity so
there's a magic difference like where

9096
02:31:11,349 --> 02:31:11,359
there's a magic difference like where
 

9097
02:31:11,359 --> 02:31:13,990
there's a magic difference like where
where you're like uh you know if an ai

9098
02:31:13,990 --> 02:31:14,000
where you're like uh you know if an ai
 

9099
02:31:14,000 --> 02:31:15,830
where you're like uh you know if an ai
system is able to come up with an

02:31:21,110 --> 02:31:21,120
that surprises everybody in a some
 

9105
02:31:21,120 --> 02:31:24,469
that surprises everybody in a some
uh in some like major way that's a phase

9106
02:31:24,469 --> 02:31:24,479
uh in some like major way that's a phase
 

9107
02:31:24,479 --> 02:31:24,870
uh in some like major way that's a phase
shift

9108
02:31:24,870 --> 02:31:24,880
shift
 

9109
02:31:24,880 --> 02:31:26,870

in our understanding of some particular
 

9111
02:31:26,880 --> 02:31:28,150
in our understanding of some particular
science or

9112
02:31:28,150 --> 02:31:28,160
science or
 

9113
02:31:28,160 --> 02:31:30,309
science or
some particular aspect to physics i feel

9114
02:31:30,309 --> 02:31:30,319
some particular aspect to physics i feel
 

9115
02:31:30,319 --> 02:31:31,270
some particular aspect to physics i feel
like that

9116
02:31:31,270 --> 02:31:31,280
like that
 

9117
02:31:31,280 --> 02:31:33,750
like that
is no longer a tool and then you can

9118
02:31:33,750 --> 02:31:33,760
is no longer a tool and then you can
 

9119
02:31:33,760 --> 02:31:35,270
is no longer a tool and then you can
start to say

9120
02:31:35,270 --> 02:31:35,280
start to say
 

9121
02:31:35,280 --> 02:31:37,910
start to say
uh that like it perhaps deserves the

9122
02:31:37,910 --> 02:31:37,920
uh that like it perhaps deserves the
 

9123
02:31:37,920 --> 02:31:38,630
uh that like it perhaps deserves the
prize

9124
02:31:38,630 --> 02:31:38,640
prize
 

9125
02:31:38,640 --> 02:31:41,510
prize
so for sure the more important the more

9126
02:31:41,510 --> 02:31:41,520
so for sure the more important the more
 

9127
02:31:41,520 --> 02:31:42,150
so for sure the more important the more
fundamental

9128
02:31:42,150 --> 02:31:42,160
fundamental
 

9129
02:31:42,160 --> 02:31:44,870
fundamental
transformation of the 21st century

9130
02:31:44,870 --> 02:31:44,880
transformation of the 21st century
 

9131
02:31:44,880 --> 02:31:46,550
transformation of the 21st century
science is exactly what you're saying

9132
02:31:46,550 --> 02:31:46,560
science is exactly what you're saying
 

9133
02:31:46,560 --> 02:31:47,590
science is exactly what you're saying
which is

9134
02:31:47,590 --> 02:31:47,600
which is
 

9135
02:31:47,600 --> 02:31:49,429
which is
probably everybody will be doing machine

9136
02:31:49,429 --> 02:31:49,439
probably everybody will be doing machine
 

9137
02:31:49,439 --> 02:31:50,630
probably everybody will be doing machine
learning

9138
02:31:50,630 --> 02:31:50,640
learning
 

9139
02:31:50,640 --> 02:31:52,309
learning
it's to some degree like if you want to

9140
02:31:52,309 --> 02:31:52,319
it's to some degree like if you want to
 

9141
02:31:52,319 --> 02:31:54,710
it's to some degree like if you want to
be successful

9142
02:31:54,710 --> 02:31:54,720
be successful
 

9143
02:31:54,720 --> 02:31:57,429
be successful
at uh unlocking the mysteries of science

9144
02:31:57,429 --> 02:31:57,439
at uh unlocking the mysteries of science
 

9145
02:31:57,439 --> 02:31:58,790
at uh unlocking the mysteries of science
you should be doing machine learning but

9146
02:31:58,790 --> 02:31:58,800
you should be doing machine learning but
 

9147
02:31:58,800 --> 02:32:01,270
you should be doing machine learning but
it's just exciting to think about like

9148
02:32:01,270 --> 02:32:01,280
it's just exciting to think about like
 

9149
02:32:01,280 --> 02:32:02,710
it's just exciting to think about like
whether there will be one that comes

9150
02:32:02,710 --> 02:32:02,720
whether there will be one that comes
 

9151
02:32:02,720 --> 02:32:04,550
whether there will be one that comes
along that's super surprising

9152
02:32:04,550 --> 02:32:04,560
along that's super surprising
 

9153
02:32:04,560 --> 02:32:07,910
along that's super surprising
and uh they'll make us question

9154
02:32:07,910 --> 02:32:07,920
and uh they'll make us question
 

9155
02:32:07,920 --> 02:32:09,910
and uh they'll make us question
like who the real inventors are in this

9156
02:32:09,910 --> 02:32:09,920
like who the real inventors are in this
 

9157
02:32:09,920 --> 02:32:11,590
like who the real inventors are in this
world yeah

9158
02:32:11,590 --> 02:32:11,600
world yeah
 

9159
02:32:11,600 --> 02:32:14,710
world yeah
yeah i think the question of isn't if

9160
02:32:14,710 --> 02:32:14,720
yeah i think the question of isn't if
 

9161
02:32:14,720 --> 02:32:15,830
yeah i think the question of isn't if
it's going to happen but when

9162
02:32:15,830 --> 02:32:15,840
it's going to happen but when
 

9163
02:32:15,840 --> 02:32:19,349
it's going to happen but when
and and but it's important in my mind

9164
02:32:19,349 --> 02:32:19,359
and and but it's important in my mind
 

9165
02:32:19,359 --> 02:32:21,910
and and but it's important in my mind
the time when that happens is also more

9166
02:32:21,910 --> 02:32:21,920
the time when that happens is also more
 

9167
02:32:21,920 --> 02:32:23,190
the time when that happens is also more
or less the same time

9168
02:32:23,190 --> 02:32:23,200
or less the same time
 

9169
02:32:23,200 --> 02:32:24,550
or less the same time
when we get artificial general

9170
02:32:24,550 --> 02:32:24,560
when we get artificial general
 

9171
02:32:24,560 --> 02:32:26,950
when we get artificial general
intelligence yes and then we have a lot

9172
02:32:26,950 --> 02:32:26,960
intelligence yes and then we have a lot
 

9173
02:32:26,960 --> 02:32:28,309
intelligence yes and then we have a lot
bigger things to worry about than

9174
02:32:28,309 --> 02:32:28,319
bigger things to worry about than
 

9175
02:32:28,319 --> 02:32:29,750
bigger things to worry about than
whether they should get the nobel prize

9176
02:32:29,750 --> 02:32:29,760
whether they should get the nobel prize
 

9177
02:32:29,760 --> 02:32:31,030
whether they should get the nobel prize
or not right

9178
02:32:31,030 --> 02:32:31,040
or not right
 

9179
02:32:31,040 --> 02:32:34,070
or not right
yeah because when you have

9180
02:32:34,070 --> 02:32:34,080
yeah because when you have
 

9181
02:32:34,080 --> 02:32:36,230
yeah because when you have
machines that can outperform our best

9182
02:32:36,230 --> 02:32:36,240
machines that can outperform our best
 

9183
02:32:36,240 --> 02:32:37,830
machines that can outperform our best
scientists

9184
02:32:37,830 --> 02:32:37,840
scientists
 

9185
02:32:37,840 --> 02:32:40,710
scientists
at science they can probably outperform

9186
02:32:40,710 --> 02:32:40,720
at science they can probably outperform
 

9187
02:32:40,720 --> 02:32:40,950
at science they can probably outperform
us

9188
02:32:40,950 --> 02:32:40,960
us
 

9189
02:32:40,960 --> 02:32:44,230
us
at a lot of other stuff as well

9190
02:32:44,230 --> 02:32:44,240
at a lot of other stuff as well
 

9191
02:32:44,240 --> 02:32:45,590
at a lot of other stuff as well
which can at a minimum you know make

9192
02:32:45,590 --> 02:32:45,600
which can at a minimum you know make
 

9193
02:32:45,600 --> 02:32:48,230
which can at a minimum you know make
them incredibly powerful agents in in

9194
02:32:48,230 --> 02:32:48,240
them incredibly powerful agents in in
 

9195
02:32:48,240 --> 02:32:49,349
them incredibly powerful agents in in
the world you know

9196
02:32:49,349 --> 02:32:49,359
the world you know
 

9197
02:32:49,359 --> 02:32:52,630
the world you know
and i think it's a mistake

9198
02:32:52,630 --> 02:32:52,640
and i think it's a mistake
 

9199
02:32:52,640 --> 02:32:54,469
and i think it's a mistake
to think we only have to start worrying

9200
02:32:54,469 --> 02:32:54,479
to think we only have to start worrying
 

9201
02:32:54,479 --> 02:32:56,150
to think we only have to start worrying
about

9202
02:32:56,150 --> 02:32:56,160
about
 

9203
02:32:56,160 --> 02:32:58,870
about
loss of control when machines get to agi

9204
02:32:58,870 --> 02:32:58,880
loss of control when machines get to agi
 

9205
02:32:58,880 --> 02:33:00,309
loss of control when machines get to agi
across the board where they can do

9206
02:33:00,309 --> 02:33:00,319
across the board where they can do
 

9207
02:33:00,319 --> 02:33:05,030
across the board where they can do
everything all our jobs long before that

9208
02:33:05,030 --> 02:33:05,040
everything all our jobs long before that
 

9209
02:33:05,040 --> 02:33:08,469
everything all our jobs long before that
they'll be hugely influential we talked

9210
02:33:08,469 --> 02:33:08,479
they'll be hugely influential we talked
 

9211
02:33:08,479 --> 02:33:09,190
they'll be hugely influential we talked
at length

9212
02:33:09,190 --> 02:33:09,200
at length
 

9213
02:33:09,200 --> 02:33:12,469
at length
about how the hacking of our minds

9214
02:33:12,469 --> 02:33:12,479
about how the hacking of our minds
 

9215
02:33:12,479 --> 02:33:16,230
about how the hacking of our minds
with um

9216
02:33:16,230 --> 02:33:16,240

 

9217
02:33:16,240 --> 02:33:17,910

algorithms trying to get us glued to our

9218
02:33:17,910 --> 02:33:17,920
algorithms trying to get us glued to our
 

9219
02:33:17,920 --> 02:33:20,550
algorithms trying to get us glued to our
screens right has already had a big

9220
02:33:20,550 --> 02:33:20,560
screens right has already had a big
 

9221
02:33:20,560 --> 02:33:21,670
screens right has already had a big
impact on on

9222
02:33:21,670 --> 02:33:21,680
impact on on
 

9223
02:33:21,680 --> 02:33:23,510
impact on on
society that was an incredibly dumb

9224
02:33:23,510 --> 02:33:23,520
society that was an incredibly dumb
 

9225
02:33:23,520 --> 02:33:25,030
society that was an incredibly dumb
algorithm in the grand scheme of things

9226
02:33:25,030 --> 02:33:25,040
algorithm in the grand scheme of things
 

9227
02:33:25,040 --> 02:33:25,830
algorithm in the grand scheme of things
right

9228
02:33:25,830 --> 02:33:25,840
right
 

9229
02:33:25,840 --> 02:33:27,990
right
just supervised machine learning yet

9230
02:33:27,990 --> 02:33:28,000
just supervised machine learning yet
 

9231
02:33:28,000 --> 02:33:29,510
just supervised machine learning yet
that had had huge impact

9232
02:33:29,510 --> 02:33:29,520
that had had huge impact
 

9233
02:33:29,520 --> 02:33:31,750
that had had huge impact
so so um i just don't want us to be

9234
02:33:31,750 --> 02:33:31,760
so so um i just don't want us to be
 

9235
02:33:31,760 --> 02:33:33,270
so so um i just don't want us to be
lulled into false sense of security and

9236
02:33:33,270 --> 02:33:33,280
lulled into false sense of security and
 

9237
02:33:33,280 --> 02:33:35,270
lulled into false sense of security and
think there won't be any societal impact

9238
02:33:35,270 --> 02:33:35,280
think there won't be any societal impact
 

9239
02:33:35,280 --> 02:33:36,950
think there won't be any societal impact
yeah until things reach human level

9240
02:33:36,950 --> 02:33:36,960
yeah until things reach human level
 

9241
02:33:36,960 --> 02:33:38,790
yeah until things reach human level
because it's happening already and it's

9242
02:33:38,790 --> 02:33:38,800
because it's happening already and it's
 

9243
02:33:38,800 --> 02:33:40,790
because it's happening already and it's
i was just thinking the other week

9244
02:33:40,790 --> 02:33:40,800
i was just thinking the other week
 

9245
02:33:40,800 --> 02:33:44,550
i was just thinking the other week
you know when i see some scaremonger

9246
02:33:44,550 --> 02:33:44,560
you know when i see some scaremonger
 

9247
02:33:44,560 --> 02:33:47,429
you know when i see some scaremonger
going oh the robots are coming the

9248
02:33:47,429 --> 02:33:47,439
going oh the robots are coming the
 

9249
02:33:47,439 --> 02:33:48,070
going oh the robots are coming the
implication

9250
02:33:48,070 --> 02:33:48,080
implication
 

9251
02:33:48,080 --> 02:33:50,150
implication
is always that they're coming to kill us

9252
02:33:50,150 --> 02:33:50,160
is always that they're coming to kill us
 

9253
02:33:50,160 --> 02:33:51,910
is always that they're coming to kill us
yeah and maybe you should have worried

9254
02:33:51,910 --> 02:33:51,920
yeah and maybe you should have worried
 

9255
02:33:51,920 --> 02:33:52,630
yeah and maybe you should have worried
about that if you were in

9256
02:33:52,630 --> 02:33:52,640
about that if you were in
 

9257
02:33:52,640 --> 02:33:54,550
about that if you were in
nagorno-karabakh

9258
02:33:54,550 --> 02:33:54,560
nagorno-karabakh
 

9259
02:33:54,560 --> 02:33:56,790
nagorno-karabakh
during the recent war there but more

9260
02:33:56,790 --> 02:33:56,800
during the recent war there but more
 

9261
02:33:56,800 --> 02:33:59,670
during the recent war there but more
seriously

9262
02:33:59,670 --> 02:33:59,680

 

9263
02:33:59,680 --> 02:34:01,510

the robots are coming right now but

9264
02:34:01,510 --> 02:34:01,520
the robots are coming right now but
 

9265
02:34:01,520 --> 02:34:03,030
the robots are coming right now but
they're mainly not coming to kill us

9266
02:34:03,030 --> 02:34:03,040
they're mainly not coming to kill us
 

9267
02:34:03,040 --> 02:34:04,800
they're mainly not coming to kill us
they're coming to hack us

9268
02:34:04,800 --> 02:34:04,810
they're coming to hack us
 

9269
02:34:04,810 --> 02:34:05,910
they're coming to hack us
[Music]

9270
02:34:05,910 --> 02:34:05,920
[Music]
 

9271
02:34:05,920 --> 02:34:08,150
[Music]
they're they're coming to hack our minds

9272
02:34:08,150 --> 02:34:08,160
they're they're coming to hack our minds
 

9273
02:34:08,160 --> 02:34:10,070
they're they're coming to hack our minds
into buying things that we maybe we

9274
02:34:10,070 --> 02:34:10,080
into buying things that we maybe we
 

9275
02:34:10,080 --> 02:34:11,190
into buying things that we maybe we
didn't need

9276
02:34:11,190 --> 02:34:11,200
didn't need
 

9277
02:34:11,200 --> 02:34:13,190
didn't need
to vote for people who may not have our

9278
02:34:13,190 --> 02:34:13,200
to vote for people who may not have our
 

9279
02:34:13,200 --> 02:34:15,270
to vote for people who may not have our
best interest in mind

9280
02:34:15,270 --> 02:34:15,280
best interest in mind
 

9281
02:34:15,280 --> 02:34:17,590
best interest in mind
and and it's kind of humbling i think

9282
02:34:17,590 --> 02:34:17,600
and and it's kind of humbling i think
 

9283
02:34:17,600 --> 02:34:18,469
and and it's kind of humbling i think
actually

9284
02:34:18,469 --> 02:34:18,479
actually
 

9285
02:34:18,479 --> 02:34:21,190
actually
as a human being to admit that it turns

9286
02:34:21,190 --> 02:34:21,200
as a human being to admit that it turns
 

9287
02:34:21,200 --> 02:34:22,550
as a human being to admit that it turns
out that our minds are actually much

9288
02:34:22,550 --> 02:34:22,560
out that our minds are actually much
 

9289
02:34:22,560 --> 02:34:24,630
out that our minds are actually much
hacked more hackable than we thought

9290
02:34:24,630 --> 02:34:24,640
hacked more hackable than we thought
 

9291
02:34:24,640 --> 02:34:26,469
hacked more hackable than we thought
and the ultimate insult is that we are

9292
02:34:26,469 --> 02:34:26,479
and the ultimate insult is that we are
 

9293
02:34:26,479 --> 02:34:29,030
and the ultimate insult is that we are
actually getting hacked by

9294
02:34:29,030 --> 02:34:29,040
actually getting hacked by
 

9295
02:34:29,040 --> 02:34:30,469
actually getting hacked by
the machine learning algorithms that are

9296
02:34:30,469 --> 02:34:30,479
the machine learning algorithms that are
 

9297
02:34:30,479 --> 02:34:32,389
the machine learning algorithms that are
in some objective sense much dumber than

9298
02:34:32,389 --> 02:34:32,399
in some objective sense much dumber than
 

9299
02:34:32,399 --> 02:34:32,710
in some objective sense much dumber than
us

9300
02:34:32,710 --> 02:34:32,720
us
 

9301
02:34:32,720 --> 02:34:34,870
us
you know but maybe we shouldn't be so

9302
02:34:34,870 --> 02:34:34,880
you know but maybe we shouldn't be so
 

9303
02:34:34,880 --> 02:34:37,990
you know but maybe we shouldn't be so
surprised because you know

9304
02:34:37,990 --> 02:34:38,000
surprised because you know
 

9305
02:34:38,000 --> 02:34:40,550
surprised because you know
how do you feel about the cute puppies

9306
02:34:40,550 --> 02:34:40,560
how do you feel about the cute puppies
 

9307
02:34:40,560 --> 02:34:41,510
how do you feel about the cute puppies
love them

9308
02:34:41,510 --> 02:34:41,520
love them
 

9309
02:34:41,520 --> 02:34:43,670
love them
so you know you would probably argue

9310
02:34:43,670 --> 02:34:43,680
so you know you would probably argue
 

9311
02:34:43,680 --> 02:34:44,950
so you know you would probably argue
that in some

9312
02:34:44,950 --> 02:34:44,960
that in some
 

9313
02:34:44,960 --> 02:34:46,630
that in some
across-the-board measure you're more

9314
02:34:46,630 --> 02:34:46,640
across-the-board measure you're more
 

9315
02:34:46,640 --> 02:34:48,630
across-the-board measure you're more
intelligent than they are but boy are

9316
02:34:48,630 --> 02:34:48,640
intelligent than they are but boy are
 

9317
02:34:48,640 --> 02:34:50,389
intelligent than they are but boy are
our cute puppies good at hacking us

9318
02:34:50,389 --> 02:34:50,399
our cute puppies good at hacking us
 

9319
02:34:50,399 --> 02:34:52,309
our cute puppies good at hacking us
right yeah they move into our house

9320
02:34:52,309 --> 02:34:52,319
right yeah they move into our house
 

9321
02:34:52,319 --> 02:34:54,070
right yeah they move into our house
persuade us to feed them and do all

9322
02:34:54,070 --> 02:34:54,080
persuade us to feed them and do all
 

9323
02:34:54,080 --> 02:34:55,429
persuade us to feed them and do all
these things what do they ever do but

9324
02:34:55,429 --> 02:34:55,439
these things what do they ever do but
 

9325
02:34:55,439 --> 02:34:56,550
these things what do they ever do but
for us

9326
02:34:56,550 --> 02:34:56,560
for us
 

9327
02:34:56,560 --> 02:34:59,429
for us
yeah other than being cute and making us

9328
02:34:59,429 --> 02:34:59,439
yeah other than being cute and making us
 

9329
02:34:59,439 --> 02:35:00,469
yeah other than being cute and making us
feel good right

9330
02:35:00,469 --> 02:35:00,479
feel good right
 

9331
02:35:00,479 --> 02:35:03,510
feel good right
so if puppies can hack us maybe we

9332
02:35:03,510 --> 02:35:03,520
so if puppies can hack us maybe we
 

9333
02:35:03,520 --> 02:35:06,150
so if puppies can hack us maybe we
shouldn't be so surprised if

9334
02:35:06,150 --> 02:35:06,160
shouldn't be so surprised if
 

9335
02:35:06,160 --> 02:35:07,429
shouldn't be so surprised if
a pretty dumb machine learning

9336
02:35:07,429 --> 02:35:07,439
a pretty dumb machine learning
 

9337
02:35:07,439 --> 02:35:09,670
a pretty dumb machine learning
algorithms can hack us too not to speak

9338
02:35:09,670 --> 02:35:09,680
algorithms can hack us too not to speak
 

9339
02:35:09,680 --> 02:35:11,670
algorithms can hack us too not to speak
of cats which is another level

9340
02:35:11,670 --> 02:35:11,680
of cats which is another level
 

9341
02:35:11,680 --> 02:35:13,910
of cats which is another level
and and i think we should to counter

9342
02:35:13,910 --> 02:35:13,920
and and i think we should to counter
 

9343
02:35:13,920 --> 02:35:15,510
and and i think we should to counter
your previous point about there

9344
02:35:15,510 --> 02:35:15,520
your previous point about there
 

9345
02:35:15,520 --> 02:35:17,510
your previous point about there
let us not think about evil creatures in

9346
02:35:17,510 --> 02:35:17,520
let us not think about evil creatures in
 

9347
02:35:17,520 --> 02:35:19,750
let us not think about evil creatures in
this world we can all agree that cats

9348
02:35:19,750 --> 02:35:19,760
this world we can all agree that cats
 

9349
02:35:19,760 --> 02:35:22,230
this world we can all agree that cats
are as close to objective evil as we can

9350
02:35:22,230 --> 02:35:22,240
are as close to objective evil as we can
 

9351
02:35:22,240 --> 02:35:22,790
are as close to objective evil as we can
get

9352
02:35:22,790 --> 02:35:22,800
get
 

9353
02:35:22,800 --> 02:35:24,790
get
but that's just me saying that okay so

9354
02:35:24,790 --> 02:35:24,800
but that's just me saying that okay so
 

9355
02:35:24,800 --> 02:35:26,469
but that's just me saying that okay so
uh you have you seen the

9356
02:35:26,469 --> 02:35:26,479
uh you have you seen the
 

9357
02:35:26,479 --> 02:35:30,630
uh you have you seen the
the cartoon i think it's maybe the onion

9358
02:35:30,630 --> 02:35:30,640
the cartoon i think it's maybe the onion
 

9359
02:35:30,640 --> 02:35:33,830
the cartoon i think it's maybe the onion
um with this incredibly cute kitten and

9360
02:35:33,830 --> 02:35:33,840
um with this incredibly cute kitten and
 

9361
02:35:33,840 --> 02:35:35,670
um with this incredibly cute kitten and
just says um

9362
02:35:35,670 --> 02:35:35,680
just says um
 

9363
02:35:35,680 --> 02:35:37,510
just says um
with underneath something that thinks

9364
02:35:37,510 --> 02:35:37,520
with underneath something that thinks
 

9365
02:35:37,520 --> 02:35:40,389
with underneath something that thinks
about murder all day

9366
02:35:40,389 --> 02:35:40,399
about murder all day
 

9367
02:35:40,399 --> 02:35:43,110
about murder all day
exactly that's that's accurate uh you've

9368
02:35:43,110 --> 02:35:43,120
exactly that's that's accurate uh you've
 

9369
02:35:43,120 --> 02:35:44,790
exactly that's that's accurate uh you've
mentioned offline that there might be a

9370
02:35:44,790 --> 02:35:44,800
mentioned offline that there might be a
 

9371
02:35:44,800 --> 02:35:45,670
mentioned offline that there might be a
link between

post biological agi and seti so last

9374
02:35:48,950 --> 02:35:48,960
post biological agi and seti so last
 

9375
02:35:48,960 --> 02:35:50,230
post biological agi and seti so last
time we

9376
02:35:50,230 --> 02:35:50,240
time we
 

9377
02:35:50,240 --> 02:35:53,830
time we
talked um you've you've talked about

9378
02:35:53,830 --> 02:35:53,840
talked um you've you've talked about
 

9379
02:35:53,840 --> 02:35:56,070
talked um you've you've talked about
this intuition that

9380
02:35:56,070 --> 02:35:56,080
this intuition that
 

9381
02:35:56,080 --> 02:35:59,270
this intuition that
we humans might be quite unique

9382
02:35:59,270 --> 02:35:59,280
we humans might be quite unique
 

9383
02:35:59,280 --> 02:36:02,870
we humans might be quite unique
in our galactic neighborhood perhaps our

9384
02:36:02,870 --> 02:36:02,880
in our galactic neighborhood perhaps our
 

9385
02:36:02,880 --> 02:36:03,590
in our galactic neighborhood perhaps our
galaxy

9386
02:36:03,590 --> 02:36:03,600
galaxy
 

9387
02:36:03,600 --> 02:36:05,830
galaxy
perhaps the entirety of the observable

9388
02:36:05,830 --> 02:36:05,840
perhaps the entirety of the observable
 

9389
02:36:05,840 --> 02:36:08,710
perhaps the entirety of the observable
universe we might be the only

9390
02:36:08,710 --> 02:36:08,720
universe we might be the only
 

9391
02:36:08,720 --> 02:36:11,270
universe we might be the only
intelligence civilization here which is

9392
02:36:11,270 --> 02:36:11,280
intelligence civilization here which is
 

9393
02:36:11,280 --> 02:36:13,590
intelligence civilization here which is
um

9394
02:36:13,590 --> 02:36:13,600
um
 

9395
02:36:13,600 --> 02:36:16,389
um
and you argue pretty well for that

9396
02:36:16,389 --> 02:36:16,399
and you argue pretty well for that
 

9397
02:36:16,399 --> 02:36:17,190
and you argue pretty well for that
thought

9398
02:36:17,190 --> 02:36:17,200
thought
 

9399
02:36:17,200 --> 02:36:20,150
thought
um so i have a few little questions

9400
02:36:20,150 --> 02:36:20,160
um so i have a few little questions
 

9401
02:36:20,160 --> 02:36:21,190
um so i have a few little questions
around this

9402
02:36:21,190 --> 02:36:21,200
around this
 

9403
02:36:21,200 --> 02:36:24,710
around this
one the scientific question

9404
02:36:24,710 --> 02:36:24,720
one the scientific question
 

9405
02:36:24,720 --> 02:36:29,270
one the scientific question
in which way would you be

9406
02:36:29,270 --> 02:36:29,280
in which way would you be
 

9407
02:36:29,280 --> 02:36:33,910
in which way would you be
if you were wrong in that intuition

9408
02:36:33,910 --> 02:36:33,920
if you were wrong in that intuition
 

9409
02:36:33,920 --> 02:36:35,830
if you were wrong in that intuition
in which way do you think you would be

9410
02:36:35,830 --> 02:36:35,840
in which way do you think you would be
 

9411
02:36:35,840 --> 02:36:36,950
in which way do you think you would be
surprised like

9412
02:36:36,950 --> 02:36:36,960
surprised like
 

9413
02:36:36,960 --> 02:36:39,190
surprised like
why were you wrong if we find out that

9414
02:36:39,190 --> 02:36:39,200
why were you wrong if we find out that
 

9415
02:36:39,200 --> 02:36:41,510
why were you wrong if we find out that
you ended up being wrong

9416
02:36:41,510 --> 02:36:41,520
you ended up being wrong
 

9417
02:36:41,520 --> 02:36:44,710
you ended up being wrong
like in which dimensions so like is it

9418
02:36:44,710 --> 02:36:44,720
like in which dimensions so like is it
 

9419
02:36:44,720 --> 02:36:47,030
like in which dimensions so like is it
because we can't

9420
02:36:47,030 --> 02:36:47,040
because we can't
 

9421
02:36:47,040 --> 02:36:50,230
because we can't
see them is it because the nature of

9422
02:36:50,230 --> 02:36:50,240
see them is it because the nature of
 

9423
02:36:50,240 --> 02:36:50,630
see them is it because the nature of
their

9424
02:36:50,630 --> 02:36:50,640
their
 

9425
02:36:50,640 --> 02:36:53,349
their
intelligence or the nature of their life

9426
02:36:53,349 --> 02:36:53,359
intelligence or the nature of their life
 

9427
02:36:53,359 --> 02:36:53,750
intelligence or the nature of their life
is

9428
02:36:53,750 --> 02:36:53,760
is
 

9429
02:36:53,760 --> 02:36:55,590
is
totally different than we can possibly

9430
02:36:55,590 --> 02:36:55,600
totally different than we can possibly
 

9431
02:36:55,600 --> 02:36:56,790
totally different than we can possibly
imagine

9432
02:36:56,790 --> 02:36:56,800
imagine
 

9433
02:36:56,800 --> 02:37:00,550
imagine
is it uh because the

9434
02:37:00,550 --> 02:37:00,560
is it uh because the
 

9435
02:37:00,560 --> 02:37:02,550
is it uh because the
i mean something about the great filters

9436
02:37:02,550 --> 02:37:02,560
i mean something about the great filters
 

9437
02:37:02,560 --> 02:37:04,550
i mean something about the great filters
and surviving them

9438
02:37:04,550 --> 02:37:04,560
and surviving them
 

9439
02:37:04,560 --> 02:37:07,750
and surviving them
or maybe because we're being protected

9440
02:37:07,750 --> 02:37:07,760
or maybe because we're being protected
 

9441
02:37:07,760 --> 02:37:09,830
or maybe because we're being protected
from signals so all those explanations

9442
02:37:09,830 --> 02:37:09,840
from signals so all those explanations
 

9443
02:37:09,840 --> 02:37:11,030
from signals so all those explanations
for

9444
02:37:11,030 --> 02:37:11,040
for
 

9445
02:37:11,040 --> 02:37:14,630
for
um for why we haven't

9446
02:37:14,630 --> 02:37:14,640
um for why we haven't
 

9447
02:37:14,640 --> 02:37:18,469
um for why we haven't
heard a big loud like red

9448
02:37:18,469 --> 02:37:18,479
heard a big loud like red
 

9449
02:37:18,479 --> 02:37:21,510
heard a big loud like red
light that says yeah we're here yeah

9450
02:37:21,510 --> 02:37:21,520
light that says yeah we're here yeah
 

9451
02:37:21,520 --> 02:37:22,870
light that says yeah we're here yeah
so there are actually two separate

9452
02:37:22,870 --> 02:37:22,880
so there are actually two separate
 

9453
02:37:22,880 --> 02:37:24,630
so there are actually two separate
things there that i could be wrong about

9454
02:37:24,630 --> 02:37:24,640
things there that i could be wrong about
 

9455
02:37:24,640 --> 02:37:26,630
things there that i could be wrong about
two separate claims that i made right

9456
02:37:26,630 --> 02:37:26,640
two separate claims that i made right
 

9457
02:37:26,640 --> 02:37:28,870
two separate claims that i made right
not them

9458
02:37:28,870 --> 02:37:28,880
not them
 

9459
02:37:28,880 --> 02:37:32,230
not them
one one of them is i made the claim i

9460
02:37:32,230 --> 02:37:32,240
one one of them is i made the claim i
 

9461
02:37:32,240 --> 02:37:33,750
one one of them is i made the claim i
think

9462
02:37:33,750 --> 02:37:33,760
think
 

9463
02:37:33,760 --> 02:37:36,870
think
most civilizations

9464
02:37:36,870 --> 02:37:36,880
most civilizations
 

9465
02:37:36,880 --> 02:37:40,950
most civilizations
when you're going from simple bacteria

9466
02:37:40,950 --> 02:37:40,960
when you're going from simple bacteria
 

9467
02:37:40,960 --> 02:37:45,510
when you're going from simple bacteria
like things to space

9468
02:37:45,510 --> 02:37:45,520

 

9469
02:37:45,520 --> 02:37:47,910

space colonizing civilizations they

9470
02:37:47,910 --> 02:37:47,920
space colonizing civilizations they
 

9471
02:37:47,920 --> 02:37:48,710
space colonizing civilizations they
spend

9472
02:37:48,710 --> 02:37:48,720
spend
 

9473
02:37:48,720 --> 02:37:51,110
spend
only a very very tiny fraction of their

9474
02:37:51,110 --> 02:37:51,120
only a very very tiny fraction of their
 

9475
02:37:51,120 --> 02:37:51,750
only a very very tiny fraction of their
other

9476
02:37:51,750 --> 02:37:51,760
other
 

9477
02:37:51,760 --> 02:37:55,349
other
of their life being where we are uh that

9478
02:37:55,349 --> 02:37:55,359
of their life being where we are uh that
 

9479
02:37:55,359 --> 02:37:57,110
of their life being where we are uh that
i could be wrong about

9480
02:37:57,110 --> 02:37:57,120
i could be wrong about
 

9481
02:37:57,120 --> 02:37:58,790
i could be wrong about
the other one i could be wrong about is

9482
02:37:58,790 --> 02:37:58,800
the other one i could be wrong about is
 

9483
02:37:58,800 --> 02:38:00,630
the other one i could be wrong about is
a quite different statement that i think

9484
02:38:00,630 --> 02:38:00,640
a quite different statement that i think
 

9485
02:38:00,640 --> 02:38:01,349
a quite different statement that i think
that actually

9486
02:38:01,349 --> 02:38:01,359
that actually
 

9487
02:38:01,359 --> 02:38:03,910
that actually
i'm guessing that we are the only

9488
02:38:03,910 --> 02:38:03,920
i'm guessing that we are the only
 

9489
02:38:03,920 --> 02:38:05,990
i'm guessing that we are the only
civilization in our observable universe

9490
02:38:05,990 --> 02:38:06,000
civilization in our observable universe
 

9491
02:38:06,000 --> 02:38:07,750
civilization in our observable universe
from which light has reached us so far

9492
02:38:07,750 --> 02:38:07,760
from which light has reached us so far
 

9493
02:38:07,760 --> 02:38:09,590
from which light has reached us so far
that that's actually

9494
02:38:09,590 --> 02:38:09,600
that that's actually
 

9495
02:38:09,600 --> 02:38:12,070
that that's actually
gotten far enough to invent telescopes

9496
02:38:12,070 --> 02:38:12,080
gotten far enough to invent telescopes
 

9497
02:38:12,080 --> 02:38:13,429
gotten far enough to invent telescopes
so let's talk about maybe both of them

9498
02:38:13,429 --> 02:38:13,439
so let's talk about maybe both of them
 

9499
02:38:13,439 --> 02:38:14,469
so let's talk about maybe both of them
in turn because they really are

9500
02:38:14,469 --> 02:38:14,479
in turn because they really are
 

9501
02:38:14,479 --> 02:38:14,870
in turn because they really are
different

9502
02:38:14,870 --> 02:38:14,880
different
 

9503
02:38:14,880 --> 02:38:17,990
different
the first one if if we look at

9504
02:38:17,990 --> 02:38:18,000
the first one if if we look at
 

9505
02:38:18,000 --> 02:38:20,469
the first one if if we look at
the n equals one the data point we have

9506
02:38:20,469 --> 02:38:20,479
the n equals one the data point we have
 

9507
02:38:20,479 --> 02:38:21,750
the n equals one the data point we have
on this planet

9508
02:38:21,750 --> 02:38:21,760
on this planet
 

9509
02:38:21,760 --> 02:38:25,110
on this planet
right so we spent um four and a half

9510
02:38:25,110 --> 02:38:25,120
right so we spent um four and a half
 

9511
02:38:25,120 --> 02:38:26,550
right so we spent um four and a half
billion years fussing around on this

9512
02:38:26,550 --> 02:38:26,560
billion years fussing around on this
 

9513
02:38:26,560 --> 02:38:29,030
billion years fussing around on this
planet with life right we got

9514
02:38:29,030 --> 02:38:29,040
planet with life right we got
 

9515
02:38:29,040 --> 02:38:31,910
planet with life right we got
and most of it it was pretty lame stuff

9516
02:38:31,910 --> 02:38:31,920
and most of it it was pretty lame stuff
 

9517
02:38:31,920 --> 02:38:33,510
and most of it it was pretty lame stuff
from an intelligence perspective

9518
02:38:33,510 --> 02:38:33,520
from an intelligence perspective
 

9519
02:38:33,520 --> 02:38:36,710
from an intelligence perspective
you know it's bacteria and then

9520
02:38:36,710 --> 02:38:36,720
you know it's bacteria and then
 

9521
02:38:36,720 --> 02:38:39,670
you know it's bacteria and then
the dinosaur is spent then but things

9522
02:38:39,670 --> 02:38:39,680
the dinosaur is spent then but things
 

9523
02:38:39,680 --> 02:38:40,870
the dinosaur is spent then but things
gradually accelerated

9524
02:38:40,870 --> 02:38:40,880
gradually accelerated
 

9525
02:38:40,880 --> 02:38:42,630
gradually accelerated
right then the dinosaurs spent over 100

9526
02:38:42,630 --> 02:38:42,640
right then the dinosaurs spent over 100
 

9527
02:38:42,640 --> 02:38:44,389
right then the dinosaurs spent over 100
million years stomping around here

9528
02:38:44,389 --> 02:38:44,399
million years stomping around here
 

9529
02:38:44,399 --> 02:38:46,790
million years stomping around here
without even inventing smartphones

9530
02:38:46,790 --> 02:38:46,800
without even inventing smartphones
 

9531
02:38:46,800 --> 02:38:49,830
without even inventing smartphones
and um and then very recently

9532
02:38:49,830 --> 02:38:49,840
and um and then very recently
 

9533
02:38:49,840 --> 02:38:51,670
and um and then very recently
you know it's only we've only spent 400

9534
02:38:51,670 --> 02:38:51,680
you know it's only we've only spent 400
 

9535
02:38:51,680 --> 02:38:53,910
you know it's only we've only spent 400
years going from newton

9536
02:38:53,910 --> 02:38:53,920
years going from newton
 

9537
02:38:53,920 --> 02:38:56,389
years going from newton
to us right yeah in terms of technology

9538
02:38:56,389 --> 02:38:56,399
to us right yeah in terms of technology
 

9539
02:38:56,399 --> 02:38:57,429
to us right yeah in terms of technology
and

9540
02:38:57,429 --> 02:38:57,439
and
 

9541
02:38:57,439 --> 02:38:59,990
and
we've look what we've done even you know

9542
02:38:59,990 --> 02:39:00,000
we've look what we've done even you know
 

9543
02:39:00,000 --> 02:39:01,349
we've look what we've done even you know
when i was a little kid there was no

9544
02:39:01,349 --> 02:39:01,359
when i was a little kid there was no
 

9545
02:39:01,359 --> 02:39:02,550
when i was a little kid there was no
internet even

9546
02:39:02,550 --> 02:39:02,560
internet even
 

9547
02:39:02,560 --> 02:39:05,830
internet even
so it's i think it's pretty likely for

9548
02:39:05,830 --> 02:39:05,840
so it's i think it's pretty likely for
 

9549
02:39:05,840 --> 02:39:06,630
so it's i think it's pretty likely for
in this

9550
02:39:06,630 --> 02:39:06,640
in this
 

9551
02:39:06,640 --> 02:39:08,309
in this
case of this planet right that we're

9552
02:39:08,309 --> 02:39:08,319
case of this planet right that we're
 

9553
02:39:08,319 --> 02:39:09,750
case of this planet right that we're
either gonna

9554
02:39:09,750 --> 02:39:09,760
either gonna
 

9555
02:39:09,760 --> 02:39:12,870
either gonna
really get our act together and

9556
02:39:12,870 --> 02:39:12,880
really get our act together and
 

9557
02:39:12,880 --> 02:39:14,389
really get our act together and
start spreading life into space the

9558
02:39:14,389 --> 02:39:14,399
start spreading life into space the
 

9559
02:39:14,399 --> 02:39:16,070
start spreading life into space the
century and doing all sorts of great

9560
02:39:16,070 --> 02:39:16,080
century and doing all sorts of great
 

9561
02:39:16,080 --> 02:39:17,030
century and doing all sorts of great
things or where you're gonna

9562
02:39:17,030 --> 02:39:17,040
things or where you're gonna
 

9563
02:39:17,040 --> 02:39:20,070
things or where you're gonna
gonna wipe out um it's a little hard

9564
02:39:20,070 --> 02:39:20,080
gonna wipe out um it's a little hard
 

9565
02:39:20,080 --> 02:39:22,790
gonna wipe out um it's a little hard
if i i couldn't be wrong in the sense

9566
02:39:22,790 --> 02:39:22,800
if i i couldn't be wrong in the sense
 

9567
02:39:22,800 --> 02:39:24,309
if i i couldn't be wrong in the sense
that maybe what happened on this

9568
02:39:24,309 --> 02:39:24,319
that maybe what happened on this
 

9569
02:39:24,319 --> 02:39:26,150
that maybe what happened on this
earth is very atypical and for some

9570
02:39:26,150 --> 02:39:26,160
earth is very atypical and for some
 

9571
02:39:26,160 --> 02:39:27,990
earth is very atypical and for some
reason what's more common on other

9572
02:39:27,990 --> 02:39:28,000
reason what's more common on other
 

9573
02:39:28,000 --> 02:39:29,270
reason what's more common on other
planets is that

9574
02:39:29,270 --> 02:39:29,280
planets is that
 

9575
02:39:29,280 --> 02:39:31,270
planets is that
they spend an enormously long time

9576
02:39:31,270 --> 02:39:31,280
they spend an enormously long time
 

9577
02:39:31,280 --> 02:39:33,270
they spend an enormously long time
futzing around with the ham radio and

9578
02:39:33,270 --> 02:39:33,280
futzing around with the ham radio and
 

9579
02:39:33,280 --> 02:39:35,110
futzing around with the ham radio and
things but they just never really

9580
02:39:35,110 --> 02:39:35,120
things but they just never really
 

9581
02:39:35,120 --> 02:39:36,630
things but they just never really
take it to the next level for reasons i

9582
02:39:36,630 --> 02:39:36,640
take it to the next level for reasons i
 

9583
02:39:36,640 --> 02:39:38,309

i'm humble and open to that but i would

02:39:41,190 --> 02:39:41,200
i'm humble and open to that but i would
 

9587
02:39:41,200 --> 02:39:41,830
i'm humble and open to that but i would

at least ten to one that our situation

02:39:43,910 --> 02:39:43,920
at least ten to one that our situation
 

9591
02:39:43,920 --> 02:39:45,270
at least ten to one that our situation
is more typical

9592
02:39:45,270 --> 02:39:45,280
is more typical
 

9593
02:39:45,280 --> 02:39:46,630
is more typical
because the whole thing with moore's law

9594
02:39:46,630 --> 02:39:46,640
because the whole thing with moore's law
 

9595
02:39:46,640 --> 02:39:48,550
because the whole thing with moore's law
and accelerating technology it's pretty

9596
02:39:48,550 --> 02:39:48,560
and accelerating technology it's pretty
 

9597
02:39:48,560 --> 02:39:51,110
and accelerating technology it's pretty
obvious why it's happening

9598
02:39:51,110 --> 02:39:51,120
obvious why it's happening
 

9599
02:39:51,120 --> 02:39:52,950
obvious why it's happening
everything that grows exponentially we

9600
02:39:52,950 --> 02:39:52,960
everything that grows exponentially we
 

9601
02:39:52,960 --> 02:39:54,389
everything that grows exponentially we
call it an explosion whether it's a

9602
02:39:54,389 --> 02:39:54,399
call it an explosion whether it's a
 

9603
02:39:54,399 --> 02:39:56,070
call it an explosion whether it's a
population explosion or a nuclear

9604
02:39:56,070 --> 02:39:56,080
population explosion or a nuclear
 

9605
02:39:56,080 --> 02:39:57,670
population explosion or a nuclear
explosion it's always caused by the same

9606
02:39:57,670 --> 02:39:57,680
explosion it's always caused by the same
 

9607
02:39:57,680 --> 02:39:58,710
explosion it's always caused by the same
thing it's that

9608
02:39:58,710 --> 02:39:58,720
thing it's that
 

9609
02:39:58,720 --> 02:40:01,429
thing it's that
the next step triggers a step after that

9610
02:40:01,429 --> 02:40:01,439
the next step triggers a step after that
 

9611
02:40:01,439 --> 02:40:02,309
the next step triggers a step after that
so i

9612
02:40:02,309 --> 02:40:02,319
so i
 

9613
02:40:02,319 --> 02:40:04,550
so i
we tomorrow's technology today's

9614
02:40:04,550 --> 02:40:04,560
we tomorrow's technology today's
 

9615
02:40:04,560 --> 02:40:06,710
we tomorrow's technology today's
technology enables tomorrow's technology

9616
02:40:06,710 --> 02:40:06,720
technology enables tomorrow's technology
 

9617
02:40:06,720 --> 02:40:07,990
technology enables tomorrow's technology
and that enables

9618
02:40:07,990 --> 02:40:08,000
and that enables
 

9619
02:40:08,000 --> 02:40:11,830
and that enables
the next level and

9620
02:40:11,830 --> 02:40:11,840

 

9621
02:40:11,840 --> 02:40:13,110

as i think because the technology is

9622
02:40:13,110 --> 02:40:13,120
as i think because the technology is
 

9623
02:40:13,120 --> 02:40:14,630
as i think because the technology is
always better of course the steps can

9624
02:40:14,630 --> 02:40:14,640
always better of course the steps can
 

9625
02:40:14,640 --> 02:40:17,110
always better of course the steps can
come faster and faster

9626
02:40:17,110 --> 02:40:17,120
come faster and faster
 

9627
02:40:17,120 --> 02:40:18,550
come faster and faster
on the other question that i might be

9628
02:40:18,550 --> 02:40:18,560
on the other question that i might be
 

9629
02:40:18,560 --> 02:40:19,750
on the other question that i might be
wrong about that's the much more

9630
02:40:19,750 --> 02:40:19,760
wrong about that's the much more
 

9631
02:40:19,760 --> 02:40:22,230
wrong about that's the much more
controversial one i think

9632
02:40:22,230 --> 02:40:22,240
controversial one i think
 

9633
02:40:22,240 --> 02:40:24,070
controversial one i think
but before we close out on this thing

9634
02:40:24,070 --> 02:40:24,080
but before we close out on this thing
 

9635
02:40:24,080 --> 02:40:25,510
but before we close out on this thing
about if

9636
02:40:25,510 --> 02:40:25,520
about if
 

9637
02:40:25,520 --> 02:40:27,429
about if
the first one if it's true that most

9638

the first one if it's true that most
 

9639
02:40:27,439 --> 02:40:29,990
the first one if it's true that most
civilizations spend only a very short

9640

civilizations spend only a very short
 

9641

if that's actually generally true but

if that's actually generally true but
 

9653
02:40:46,080 --> 02:40:48,309
if that's actually generally true but
then that should apply also elsewhere

then that should apply also elsewhere

then that should apply also elsewhere
out there so we we should be very very

it's much more likely that we find this

it's much more likely that we find this

and just move into their little virtual
 

9723
02:41:51,840 --> 02:41:53,590
and just move into their little virtual
reality and not disturb the

02:42:02,160 --> 02:42:03,590
have millions of civilizations out there
or billions of them

9734
02:42:03,590 --> 02:42:03,600
or billions of them
 

9735
02:42:03,600 --> 02:42:05,990
or billions of them
all it takes is one with a more

9736
02:42:05,990 --> 02:42:06,000
all it takes is one with a more
 

9737
02:42:06,000 --> 02:42:07,750
all it takes is one with a more
ambitious mentality

9738
02:42:07,750 --> 02:42:07,760
ambitious mentality
 

9739
02:42:07,760 --> 02:42:09,750
ambitious mentality
right that decides hey we are going to

9740
02:42:09,750 --> 02:42:09,760
right that decides hey we are going to
 

9741
02:42:09,760 --> 02:42:11,990
right that decides hey we are going to
go out and

9742
02:42:11,990 --> 02:42:12,000
go out and
 

9743
02:42:12,000 --> 02:42:15,429
go out and
settle a bunch of other solar systems

9744
02:42:15,429 --> 02:42:15,439
settle a bunch of other solar systems
 

9745
02:42:15,439 --> 02:42:17,429
settle a bunch of other solar systems
and maybe galaxies

9746
02:42:17,429 --> 02:42:17,439
and maybe galaxies
 

9747
02:42:17,439 --> 02:42:18,550
and maybe galaxies
and then it doesn't matter if they're a

9748
02:42:18,550 --> 02:42:18,560
and then it doesn't matter if they're a
 

9749
02:42:18,560 --> 02:42:19,830
and then it doesn't matter if they're a
bunch of quiet buddhists we're still

9750
02:42:19,830 --> 02:42:19,840
bunch of quiet buddhists we're still
 

9751
02:42:19,840 --> 02:42:21,110
bunch of quiet buddhists we're still
going to notice

9752
02:42:21,110 --> 02:42:21,120
going to notice
 

9753
02:42:21,120 --> 02:42:23,429
going to notice
yeah that expansionist one right and it

9754
02:42:23,429 --> 02:42:23,439
yeah that expansionist one right and it
 

9755
02:42:23,439 --> 02:42:24,230
yeah that expansionist one right and it
seems like

9756
02:42:24,230 --> 02:42:24,240
seems like
 

9757
02:42:24,240 --> 02:42:26,469
seems like
quite the stretch to assume that you

9758
02:42:26,469 --> 02:42:26,479
quite the stretch to assume that you
 

9759
02:42:26,479 --> 02:42:28,230
quite the stretch to assume that you
know we know even in our own galaxy that

9760
02:42:28,230 --> 02:42:28,240
know we know even in our own galaxy that
 

9761
02:42:28,240 --> 02:42:30,389
know we know even in our own galaxy that
there are

9762
02:42:30,389 --> 02:42:30,399
there are
 

9763
02:42:30,399 --> 02:42:33,269
there are
probably a billion or more planets that

9764
02:42:33,269 --> 02:42:33,279
probably a billion or more planets that
 

9765
02:42:33,279 --> 02:42:35,349
probably a billion or more planets that
are pretty earth-like

9766
02:42:35,349 --> 02:42:35,359
are pretty earth-like
 

9767
02:42:35,359 --> 02:42:37,110
are pretty earth-like
and many of them were formed over a

9768
02:42:37,110 --> 02:42:37,120
and many of them were formed over a
 

9769
02:42:37,120 --> 02:42:38,710
and many of them were formed over a
billion years before ours

9770
02:42:38,710 --> 02:42:38,720
billion years before ours
 

9771
02:42:38,720 --> 02:42:42,150
billion years before ours
so had a big head start so if you

9772
02:42:42,150 --> 02:42:42,160
so had a big head start so if you
 

9773
02:42:42,160 --> 02:42:44,950
so had a big head start so if you
actually assume also that life happens

9774
02:42:44,950 --> 02:42:44,960
actually assume also that life happens
 

9775
02:42:44,960 --> 02:42:45,349
actually assume also that life happens
kind of

9776
02:42:45,349 --> 02:42:45,359
kind of
 

9777
02:42:45,359 --> 02:42:48,469
kind of
automatically on an earth-like planet

9778
02:42:48,469 --> 02:42:48,479
automatically on an earth-like planet
 

9779
02:42:48,479 --> 02:42:50,710
automatically on an earth-like planet
i think it's it's pretty quite the

9780
02:42:50,710 --> 02:42:50,720
i think it's it's pretty quite the
 

9781
02:42:50,720 --> 02:42:52,630
i think it's it's pretty quite the
stretch to then go and say okay so

9782
02:42:52,630 --> 02:42:52,640
stretch to then go and say okay so
 

9783
02:42:52,640 --> 02:42:54,309
stretch to then go and say okay so
we are billions of another billion

9784
02:42:54,309 --> 02:42:54,319
we are billions of another billion
 

9785
02:42:54,319 --> 02:42:55,910
we are billions of another billion
civilizations out there that also have

9786
02:42:55,910 --> 02:42:55,920
civilizations out there that also have
 

9787
02:42:55,920 --> 02:42:56,950
civilizations out there that also have
our level of tech

9788
02:42:56,950 --> 02:42:56,960
our level of tech
 

9789
02:42:56,960 --> 02:42:59,349
our level of tech
and they all decided to become buddhists

9790
02:42:59,349 --> 02:42:59,359
and they all decided to become buddhists
 

9791
02:42:59,359 --> 02:43:00,790
and they all decided to become buddhists
and not a single one

9792
02:43:00,790 --> 02:43:00,800
and not a single one
 

9793
02:43:00,800 --> 02:43:02,389
and not a single one
decided to go like go hitler on the

9794
02:43:02,389 --> 02:43:02,399
decided to go like go hitler on the
 

9795
02:43:02,399 --> 02:43:04,150
decided to go like go hitler on the
galaxy and say we need

9796
02:43:04,150 --> 02:43:04,160
galaxy and say we need
 

9797
02:43:04,160 --> 02:43:06,389
galaxy and say we need
to go on and colonize or and or not and

9798
02:43:06,389 --> 02:43:06,399
to go on and colonize or and or not and
 

9799
02:43:06,399 --> 02:43:08,070
to go on and colonize or and or not and
not a single one decided for more

9800
02:43:08,070 --> 02:43:08,080
not a single one decided for more
 

9801
02:43:08,080 --> 02:43:09,670
not a single one decided for more
benevolent reasons to go out and get

9802
02:43:09,670 --> 02:43:09,680
benevolent reasons to go out and get
 

9803
02:43:09,680 --> 02:43:11,590
benevolent reasons to go out and get
more resources

9804
02:43:11,590 --> 02:43:11,600
more resources
 

9805
02:43:11,600 --> 02:43:13,269
more resources
that that seems seems like a bit of a

9806
02:43:13,269 --> 02:43:13,279
that that seems seems like a bit of a
 

9807
02:43:13,279 --> 02:43:15,349
that that seems seems like a bit of a
stretch frankly and this leads into the

9808
02:43:15,349 --> 02:43:15,359
stretch frankly and this leads into the
 

9809
02:43:15,359 --> 02:43:17,590
stretch frankly and this leads into the
the second thing you challenged me to be

9810
02:43:17,590 --> 02:43:17,600
the second thing you challenged me to be
 

9811
02:43:17,600 --> 02:43:18,710
the second thing you challenged me to be
that i might be wrong about

9812
02:43:18,710 --> 02:43:18,720
that i might be wrong about
 

9813
02:43:18,720 --> 02:43:22,389
that i might be wrong about
how rare or common is life you know

9814
02:43:22,389 --> 02:43:22,399
how rare or common is life you know
 

9815
02:43:22,399 --> 02:43:23,990
how rare or common is life you know
so francis drake when he wrote down the

9816
02:43:23,990 --> 02:43:24,000
so francis drake when he wrote down the
 

9817
02:43:24,000 --> 02:43:26,389
so francis drake when he wrote down the
drake equation multiplied together a

9818
02:43:26,389 --> 02:43:26,399
drake equation multiplied together a
 

9819
02:43:26,399 --> 02:43:27,670
drake equation multiplied together a
huge number of factors

9820
02:43:27,670 --> 02:43:27,680
huge number of factors
 

9821
02:43:27,680 --> 02:43:29,670
huge number of factors
and then we don't know any of them so we

9822
02:43:29,670 --> 02:43:29,680
and then we don't know any of them so we
 

9823
02:43:29,680 --> 02:43:31,030
and then we don't know any of them so we
know even less about

9824
02:43:31,030 --> 02:43:31,040
know even less about
 

9825
02:43:31,040 --> 02:43:32,790
know even less about
what you get when you multiply together

9826
02:43:32,790 --> 02:43:32,800
what you get when you multiply together
 

9827
02:43:32,800 --> 02:43:35,349
what you get when you multiply together
the whole product yeah

9828
02:43:35,349 --> 02:43:35,359
the whole product yeah
 

9829
02:43:35,359 --> 02:43:37,429
the whole product yeah
since then a lot of those factors have

9830
02:43:37,429 --> 02:43:37,439
since then a lot of those factors have
 

9831
02:43:37,439 --> 02:43:39,030
since then a lot of those factors have
become much better known

9832
02:43:39,030 --> 02:43:39,040
become much better known
 

9833
02:43:39,040 --> 02:43:41,190
become much better known
one of his big uncertainties was how

9834
02:43:41,190 --> 02:43:41,200
one of his big uncertainties was how
 

9835
02:43:41,200 --> 02:43:43,110
one of his big uncertainties was how
common is it that a solar system even

9836
02:43:43,110 --> 02:43:43,120
common is it that a solar system even
 

9837
02:43:43,120 --> 02:43:44,389
common is it that a solar system even
has a planet right

9838
02:43:44,389 --> 02:43:44,399
has a planet right
 

9839
02:43:44,399 --> 02:43:46,389
has a planet right
well now we know it's very common

9840
02:43:46,389 --> 02:43:46,399
well now we know it's very common
 

9841
02:43:46,399 --> 02:43:47,910
well now we know it's very common
earth-like planets we know

9842
02:43:47,910 --> 02:43:47,920
earth-like planets we know
 

9843
02:43:47,920 --> 02:43:50,389
earth-like planets we know
we have better diamonds many many of

9844
02:43:50,389 --> 02:43:50,399
we have better diamonds many many of
 

9845
02:43:50,399 --> 02:43:52,230
we have better diamonds many many of
them even in our galaxy

9846
02:43:52,230 --> 02:43:52,240
them even in our galaxy
 

9847
02:43:52,240 --> 02:43:54,630
them even in our galaxy
at the same time you know we have thanks

9848
02:43:54,630 --> 02:43:54,640
at the same time you know we have thanks
 

9849
02:43:54,640 --> 02:43:57,030
at the same time you know we have thanks
to i'm a big supporter of the seti

to i'm a big supporter of the seti
 

9851
02:43:57,040 --> 02:43:57,590
to i'm a big supporter of the seti
project

9852
02:43:57,590 --> 02:43:57,600
project
 

9853
02:43:57,600 --> 02:43:59,990
project
and its cousins and i think we should

9854
02:43:59,990 --> 02:44:00,000
and its cousins and i think we should
 

9855
02:44:00,000 --> 02:44:01,830
and its cousins and i think we should
keep doing this and we've learned a lot

9856
02:44:01,830 --> 02:44:01,840
keep doing this and we've learned a lot
 

9857
02:44:01,840 --> 02:44:04,150
keep doing this and we've learned a lot
we've we've learned that so far all we

9858
02:44:04,150 --> 02:44:04,160
we've we've learned that so far all we
 

9859
02:44:04,160 --> 02:44:05,910
we've we've learned that so far all we
have is still

9860
02:44:05,910 --> 02:44:05,920
have is still
 

9861
02:44:05,920 --> 02:44:08,150
have is still
unconvincing hints nothing more right

9862
02:44:08,150 --> 02:44:08,160
unconvincing hints nothing more right
 

9863
02:44:08,160 --> 02:44:09,830
unconvincing hints nothing more right
and and there are certainly many

9864
02:44:09,830 --> 02:44:09,840
and and there are certainly many
 

9865
02:44:09,840 --> 02:44:11,510
and and there are certainly many
scenarios where it would be

9866
02:44:11,510 --> 02:44:11,520
scenarios where it would be
 

9867
02:44:11,520 --> 02:44:14,630
scenarios where it would be
dead obvious if there were

9868
02:44:14,630 --> 02:44:14,640
dead obvious if there were
 

9869
02:44:14,640 --> 02:44:17,510
dead obvious if there were
100 million other human-like

9870
02:44:17,510 --> 02:44:17,520
100 million other human-like
 

9871
02:44:17,520 --> 02:44:19,110
100 million other human-like
civilizations in our galaxy

9872
02:44:19,110 --> 02:44:19,120
civilizations in our galaxy
 

9873
02:44:19,120 --> 02:44:21,269
civilizations in our galaxy
it would not be that hard to notice some

9874
02:44:21,269 --> 02:44:21,279
it would not be that hard to notice some
 

9875
02:44:21,279 --> 02:44:22,950
it would not be that hard to notice some
of them with today's technology and we

9876
02:44:22,950 --> 02:44:22,960
of them with today's technology and we
 

9877
02:44:22,960 --> 02:44:24,309
of them with today's technology and we
haven't right so

9878
02:44:24,309 --> 02:44:24,319
haven't right so
 

9879
02:44:24,319 --> 02:44:27,269
haven't right so
so what we can what we can say is well

9880
02:44:27,269 --> 02:44:27,279
so what we can what we can say is well
 

9881
02:44:27,279 --> 02:44:29,510
so what we can what we can say is well
okay

9882
02:44:29,510 --> 02:44:29,520
okay
 

9883
02:44:29,520 --> 02:44:31,190
okay
we can rule out that there is a human

9884
02:44:31,190 --> 02:44:31,200
we can rule out that there is a human
 

9885
02:44:31,200 --> 02:44:32,950
we can rule out that there is a human
level of civilization on the moon

9886
02:44:32,950 --> 02:44:32,960
level of civilization on the moon
 

9887
02:44:32,960 --> 02:44:35,830
level of civilization on the moon
and in fact in many nearby solar systems

9888
02:44:35,830 --> 02:44:35,840
and in fact in many nearby solar systems
 

9889
02:44:35,840 --> 02:44:37,910
and in fact in many nearby solar systems
where we

9890
02:44:37,910 --> 02:44:37,920
where we
 

9891
02:44:37,920 --> 02:44:39,510
where we
we cannot rule out of course that there

9892
02:44:39,510 --> 02:44:39,520
we cannot rule out of course that there
 

9893
02:44:39,520 --> 02:44:41,190
we cannot rule out of course that there
is something like earth

9894
02:44:41,190 --> 02:44:41,200
is something like earth
 

9895
02:44:41,200 --> 02:44:43,990
is something like earth
sitting in a galaxy 5 billion light

9896
02:44:43,990 --> 02:44:44,000
sitting in a galaxy 5 billion light
 

9897
02:44:44,000 --> 02:44:46,870
sitting in a galaxy 5 billion light
years away

9898
02:44:46,870 --> 02:44:46,880
years away
 

9899
02:44:46,880 --> 02:44:48,950
years away
but we've ruled out a lot and that's

9900
02:44:48,950 --> 02:44:48,960
but we've ruled out a lot and that's
 

9901
02:44:48,960 --> 02:44:50,150
but we've ruled out a lot and that's
already kind of shocking

9902
02:44:50,150 --> 02:44:50,160
already kind of shocking
 

9903
02:44:50,160 --> 02:44:51,510
already kind of shocking
given that they're all these planets

9904
02:44:51,510 --> 02:44:51,520
given that they're all these planets
 

9905
02:44:51,520 --> 02:44:53,190
given that they're all these planets
there you know so like where are they

9906
02:44:53,190 --> 02:44:53,200
there you know so like where are they
 

9907
02:44:53,200 --> 02:44:55,110
there you know so like where are they
where are they all that's the that's the

9908
02:44:55,110 --> 02:44:55,120
where are they all that's the that's the
 

9909
02:44:55,120 --> 02:44:56,389
where are they all that's the that's the
classic fermi paradox

9910
02:44:56,389 --> 02:44:56,399
classic fermi paradox
 

9911
02:44:56,399 --> 02:44:59,910
classic fermi paradox
yeah and and um so my argument which

9912
02:44:59,910 --> 02:44:59,920
yeah and and um so my argument which
 

9913
02:44:59,920 --> 02:45:01,030
yeah and and um so my argument which
might very well be wrong

9914
02:45:01,030 --> 02:45:01,040
might very well be wrong
 

9915
02:45:01,040 --> 02:45:02,389
might very well be wrong
it's very simple really it just goes

9916
02:45:02,389 --> 02:45:02,399
it's very simple really it just goes
 

9917
02:45:02,399 --> 02:45:04,150
it's very simple really it just goes
like this okay we have no clue about

9918
02:45:04,150 --> 02:45:04,160
like this okay we have no clue about
 

9919
02:45:04,160 --> 02:45:06,950
like this okay we have no clue about
this

9920
02:45:06,950 --> 02:45:06,960

 

9921
02:45:06,960 --> 02:45:08,950

it could be the the the probability of

9922
02:45:08,950 --> 02:45:08,960
it could be the the the probability of
 

9923
02:45:08,960 --> 02:45:10,710
it could be the the the probability of
getting life on a random planet it could

9924
02:45:10,710 --> 02:45:10,720
getting life on a random planet it could
 

9925
02:45:10,720 --> 02:45:11,670
getting life on a random planet it could
be

9926
02:45:11,670 --> 02:45:11,680
be
 

9927
02:45:11,680 --> 02:45:13,990
be
10 to the minus one a priori or ten to

9928
02:45:13,990 --> 02:45:14,000
10 to the minus one a priori or ten to
 

9929
02:45:14,000 --> 02:45:14,710
10 to the minus one a priori or ten to
the minus five

9930
02:45:14,710 --> 02:45:14,720
the minus five
 

9931
02:45:14,720 --> 02:45:16,870
the minus five
ten ten to the minus twenty ten to minus

9932
02:45:16,870 --> 02:45:16,880
ten ten to the minus twenty ten to minus
 

9933
02:45:16,880 --> 02:45:18,230
ten ten to the minus twenty ten to minus
thirty ten to the minus

9934
02:45:18,230 --> 02:45:18,240
thirty ten to the minus
 

9935
02:45:18,240 --> 02:45:20,469
thirty ten to the minus
forty basically every order of magnitude

9936
02:45:20,469 --> 02:45:20,479
forty basically every order of magnitude
 

9937
02:45:20,479 --> 02:45:23,030
forty basically every order of magnitude
is about equally likely

9938
02:45:23,030 --> 02:45:23,040
is about equally likely
 

9939
02:45:23,040 --> 02:45:25,269
is about equally likely
when you then do the math and ask how

9940
02:45:25,269 --> 02:45:25,279
when you then do the math and ask how
 

9941
02:45:25,279 --> 02:45:27,269
when you then do the math and ask how
close is our nearest neighbor

9942
02:45:27,269 --> 02:45:27,279
close is our nearest neighbor
 

9943
02:45:27,279 --> 02:45:29,110
close is our nearest neighbor
it's again equally likely that it's 10

9944
02:45:29,110 --> 02:45:29,120
it's again equally likely that it's 10
 

9945
02:45:29,120 --> 02:45:31,190
it's again equally likely that it's 10
to the 10 meters away 10 to 20 meters

9946
02:45:31,190 --> 02:45:31,200
to the 10 meters away 10 to 20 meters
 

9947
02:45:31,200 --> 02:45:33,269
to the 10 meters away 10 to 20 meters
away 10 to 30 meters away

9948
02:45:33,269 --> 02:45:33,279
away 10 to 30 meters away
 

9949
02:45:33,279 --> 02:45:34,870
away 10 to 30 meters away
we can we have some nerdy ways of

9950
02:45:34,870 --> 02:45:34,880
we can we have some nerdy ways of
 

9951
02:45:34,880 --> 02:45:36,070
we can we have some nerdy ways of
talking about this with bayesian

9952
02:45:36,070 --> 02:45:36,080
talking about this with bayesian
 

9953
02:45:36,080 --> 02:45:38,150
talking about this with bayesian
statistics and a uniform log prior but

9954
02:45:38,150 --> 02:45:38,160
statistics and a uniform log prior but
 

9955
02:45:38,160 --> 02:45:39,349
statistics and a uniform log prior but
that's irrelevant

9956
02:45:39,349 --> 02:45:39,359
that's irrelevant
 

9957
02:45:39,359 --> 02:45:42,230
that's irrelevant
this is the simple basic argument and

9958
02:45:42,230 --> 02:45:42,240
this is the simple basic argument and
 

9959
02:45:42,240 --> 02:45:44,790
this is the simple basic argument and
now comes the data so we can say okay

9960
02:45:44,790 --> 02:45:44,800
now comes the data so we can say okay
 

9961
02:45:44,800 --> 02:45:46,230
now comes the data so we can say okay
how many were there all these orders of

9962
02:45:46,230 --> 02:45:46,240
how many were there all these orders of
 

9963
02:45:46,240 --> 02:45:49,190
how many were there all these orders of
magnitude 10 to the 26 meters away

9964
02:45:49,190 --> 02:45:49,200
magnitude 10 to the 26 meters away
 

9965
02:45:49,200 --> 02:45:51,030
magnitude 10 to the 26 meters away
there's the edge of our observable

9966
02:45:51,030 --> 02:45:51,040
there's the edge of our observable
 

9967
02:45:51,040 --> 02:45:53,030
there's the edge of our observable
universe if it's farther than that light

9968
02:45:53,030 --> 02:45:53,040
universe if it's farther than that light
 

9969
02:45:53,040 --> 02:45:54,790
universe if it's farther than that light
hasn't even reached us yet

9970
02:45:54,790 --> 02:45:54,800
hasn't even reached us yet
 

9971
02:45:54,800 --> 02:45:57,670
hasn't even reached us yet
if it's uh less than 10 to the 16 meters

9972
02:45:57,670 --> 02:45:57,680
if it's uh less than 10 to the 16 meters
 

9973
02:45:57,680 --> 02:45:59,990
if it's uh less than 10 to the 16 meters
away well it's

9974
02:45:59,990 --> 02:46:00,000
away well it's
 

9975
02:46:00,000 --> 02:46:02,950
away well it's
within an earth survey it's no farther

9976
02:46:02,950 --> 02:46:02,960
within an earth survey it's no farther
 

9977
02:46:02,960 --> 02:46:04,389
within an earth survey it's no farther
away than the sun we can definitely rule

9978
02:46:04,389 --> 02:46:04,399
away than the sun we can definitely rule
 

9979
02:46:04,399 --> 02:46:05,670
away than the sun we can definitely rule
that out you know

9980
02:46:05,670 --> 02:46:05,680
that out you know
 

9981
02:46:05,680 --> 02:46:08,630
that out you know
um so i think about it like this a

9982
02:46:08,630 --> 02:46:08,640
um so i think about it like this a
 

9983
02:46:08,640 --> 02:46:10,710
um so i think about it like this a
priori before we look to telescopes you

9984
02:46:10,710 --> 02:46:10,720
priori before we look to telescopes you
 

9985
02:46:10,720 --> 02:46:11,750
priori before we look to telescopes you
know

9986
02:46:11,750 --> 02:46:11,760
know
 

9987
02:46:11,760 --> 02:46:14,389
know
it could be 10 10 meters 10 to 20 10 to

9988
02:46:14,389 --> 02:46:14,399
it could be 10 10 meters 10 to 20 10 to
 

9989
02:46:14,399 --> 02:46:16,469
it could be 10 10 meters 10 to 20 10 to
the 30 to the 40th and 50th and

9990
02:46:16,469 --> 02:46:16,479
the 30 to the 40th and 50th and
 

9991
02:46:16,479 --> 02:46:19,510
the 30 to the 40th and 50th and
equally likely anywhere here yeah uh

9992
02:46:19,510 --> 02:46:19,520
equally likely anywhere here yeah uh
 

9993
02:46:19,520 --> 02:46:22,710
equally likely anywhere here yeah uh
and now we've ruled out like this chunk

9994
02:46:22,710 --> 02:46:22,720
and now we've ruled out like this chunk
 

9995
02:46:22,720 --> 02:46:25,910
and now we've ruled out like this chunk
yeah and most of it is outside and here

9996
02:46:25,910 --> 02:46:25,920
yeah and most of it is outside and here
 

9997
02:46:25,920 --> 02:46:27,269
yeah and most of it is outside and here
is the edge of our observable universe

9998
02:46:27,269 --> 02:46:27,279
is the edge of our observable universe
 

9999
02:46:27,279 --> 02:46:29,030
is the edge of our observable universe
yes yep so

10000
02:46:29,030 --> 02:46:29,040
yes yep so
 

10001
02:46:29,040 --> 02:46:30,389
yes yep so
i'm certainly not saying i don't think

10002
02:46:30,389 --> 02:46:30,399
i'm certainly not saying i don't think
 

10003
02:46:30,399 --> 02:46:32,389
i'm certainly not saying i don't think
there's any life elsewhere in space

10004
02:46:32,389 --> 02:46:32,399
there's any life elsewhere in space
 

10005
02:46:32,399 --> 02:46:34,150
there's any life elsewhere in space
if space is infinite then you're

10006
02:46:34,150 --> 02:46:34,160
if space is infinite then you're
 

10007
02:46:34,160 --> 02:46:36,790
if space is infinite then you're
basically 100 guaranteed that there is

10008
02:46:36,790 --> 02:46:36,800
basically 100 guaranteed that there is
 

10009
02:46:36,800 --> 02:46:41,269
basically 100 guaranteed that there is
but the probability that there is life

10010
02:46:41,269 --> 02:46:41,279

 

10011
02:46:41,279 --> 02:46:42,710

that the nearest neighbor it happens to

10012
02:46:42,710 --> 02:46:42,720
that the nearest neighbor it happens to
 

10013
02:46:42,720 --> 02:46:45,269
that the nearest neighbor it happens to
be in this little region between

10014
02:46:45,269 --> 02:46:45,279
be in this little region between
 

10015
02:46:45,279 --> 02:46:47,030
be in this little region between
where we would have seen it already yeah

10016
02:46:47,030 --> 02:46:47,040
where we would have seen it already yeah
 

10017
02:46:47,040 --> 02:46:48,870
where we would have seen it already yeah
and where we will never see it there's

10018
02:46:48,870 --> 02:46:48,880
and where we will never see it there's
 

10019
02:46:48,880 --> 02:46:49,349
and where we will never see it there's
actually

10020
02:46:49,349 --> 02:46:49,359
actually
 

10021
02:46:49,359 --> 02:46:52,150
actually
significantly less than one i think and

10022
02:46:52,150 --> 02:46:52,160
significantly less than one i think and
 

10023
02:46:52,160 --> 02:46:52,550
significantly less than one i think and
and

10024
02:46:52,550 --> 02:46:52,560
and
 

10025
02:46:52,560 --> 02:46:54,150
and
i think there's a moral lesson from this

10026
02:46:54,150 --> 02:46:54,160
i think there's a moral lesson from this
 

10027
02:46:54,160 --> 02:46:55,750
i think there's a moral lesson from this
which is really important

10028
02:46:55,750 --> 02:46:55,760
which is really important
 

10029
02:46:55,760 --> 02:46:58,790
which is really important
which is to be good stewards

10030
02:46:58,790 --> 02:46:58,800
which is to be good stewards
 

10031
02:46:58,800 --> 02:47:01,030
which is to be good stewards
of this planet and this shot we've had

10032
02:47:01,030 --> 02:47:01,040
of this planet and this shot we've had
 

10033
02:47:01,040 --> 02:47:03,670
of this planet and this shot we've had
you know it can be very dangerous to say

10034
02:47:03,670 --> 02:47:03,680
you know it can be very dangerous to say
 

10035
02:47:03,680 --> 02:47:05,910
you know it can be very dangerous to say
oh you know it's fine if we nuke our

10036
02:47:05,910 --> 02:47:05,920
oh you know it's fine if we nuke our
 

10037
02:47:05,920 --> 02:47:07,590
oh you know it's fine if we nuke our
planet or ruin the climate

10038
02:47:07,590 --> 02:47:07,600
planet or ruin the climate
 

10039
02:47:07,600 --> 02:47:10,309
planet or ruin the climate
or mess it up with an unaligned ai

10040
02:47:10,309 --> 02:47:10,319
or mess it up with an unaligned ai
 

10041
02:47:10,319 --> 02:47:11,269
or mess it up with an unaligned ai
because

10042
02:47:11,269 --> 02:47:11,279
because
 

10043
02:47:11,279 --> 02:47:14,230
because
i know there is this nice star trek

10044
02:47:14,230 --> 02:47:14,240
i know there is this nice star trek
 

10045
02:47:14,240 --> 02:47:15,750
i know there is this nice star trek
fleet out there they're going to swoop

10046
02:47:15,750 --> 02:47:15,760
fleet out there they're going to swoop
 

10047
02:47:15,760 --> 02:47:16,070
fleet out there they're going to swoop
in

10048
02:47:16,070 --> 02:47:16,080

this is about as far from that as you

this is about as far from that as you
can come but we realize that what we do

can come but we realize that what we do
 

10099

how empowering is that yeah survival of

02:48:19,510 --> 02:48:19,520
how empowering is that yeah survival of
 

10109
02:48:19,520 --> 02:48:21,349
how empowering is that yeah survival of
consciousness i mean and the

empowering aspect of the drake equation
 

10115
02:48:26,800 --> 02:48:27,670
empowering aspect of the drake equation
is

10116
02:48:27,670 --> 02:48:27,680
is
 

10117
02:48:27,680 --> 02:48:29,750
is
say that there is a huge number of

10118
02:48:29,750 --> 02:48:29,760
say that there is a huge number of
 

10119
02:48:29,760 --> 02:48:31,670
say that there is a huge number of
intelligent civilizations that spring up

10120
02:48:31,670 --> 02:48:31,680
intelligent civilizations that spring up
 

10121
02:48:31,680 --> 02:48:32,950
intelligent civilizations that spring up
everywhere

10122
02:48:32,950 --> 02:48:32,960
everywhere
 

10123
02:48:32,960 --> 02:48:34,950
everywhere
but because of the drake equation which

10124
02:48:34,950 --> 02:48:34,960
but because of the drake equation which
 

10125
02:48:34,960 --> 02:48:37,590
but because of the drake equation which
is the lifetime of a civilization

10126
02:48:37,590 --> 02:48:37,600
is the lifetime of a civilization
 

10127
02:48:37,600 --> 02:48:40,070
is the lifetime of a civilization
yeah maybe many of them hit a wall and

10128
02:48:40,070 --> 02:48:40,080
yeah maybe many of them hit a wall and
 

10129
02:48:40,080 --> 02:48:40,630
yeah maybe many of them hit a wall and
yeah

10130
02:48:40,630 --> 02:48:40,640
yeah
 

10131
02:48:40,640 --> 02:48:42,870
yeah
and just like you said it's clear that

10132
02:48:42,870 --> 02:48:42,880
and just like you said it's clear that
 

10133
02:48:42,880 --> 02:48:44,550
and just like you said it's clear that
that for us the great

seems to be coming
 

10139
02:48:48,560 --> 02:48:51,750

you know in the next 100 years so it's

10140
02:48:51,750 --> 02:48:51,760
you know in the next 100 years so it's

yet another search for life on mars

10167
02:49:18,560 --> 02:49:19,990
us surviving this yes you already made
the argument and brought rush there

10168
02:49:19,990 --> 02:49:20,000
the argument and brought rush there
 

10169
02:49:20,000 --> 02:49:20,790
the argument and brought rush there
right

10170
02:49:20,790 --> 02:49:20,800
right
 

10171
02:49:20,800 --> 02:49:23,670
right
but just unpack it right the point is we

10172
02:49:23,670 --> 02:49:23,680
but just unpack it right the point is we
 

10173
02:49:23,680 --> 02:49:26,790
but just unpack it right the point is we
already know

10174
02:49:26,790 --> 02:49:26,800
already know
 

10175
02:49:26,800 --> 02:49:28,469
already know
there's a crap ton of planets out there

10176
02:49:28,469 --> 02:49:28,479
there's a crap ton of planets out there
 

10177
02:49:28,479 --> 02:49:30,389
there's a crap ton of planets out there
that are earth-like and we also know

10178
02:49:30,389 --> 02:49:30,399
that are earth-like and we also know
 

10179
02:49:30,399 --> 02:49:30,710
that are earth-like and we also know
that

10180
02:49:30,710 --> 02:49:30,720
that
 

10181
02:49:30,720 --> 02:49:33,510
that
most of them do not seem to have

10182
02:49:33,510 --> 02:49:33,520
most of them do not seem to have
 

10183
02:49:33,520 --> 02:49:35,030
most of them do not seem to have
anything like our kind of life on them

10184
02:49:35,030 --> 02:49:35,040
anything like our kind of life on them
 

10185
02:49:35,040 --> 02:49:35,349
anything like our kind of life on them
so

10186
02:49:35,349 --> 02:49:35,359
so
 

10187
02:49:35,359 --> 02:49:38,309
so
what went wrong there's clearly one step

10188
02:49:38,309 --> 02:49:38,319
what went wrong there's clearly one step
 

10189
02:49:38,319 --> 02:49:40,550
what went wrong there's clearly one step
along the evolutionary at least one

10190
02:49:40,550 --> 02:49:40,560
along the evolutionary at least one
 

10191
02:49:40,560 --> 02:49:43,670
along the evolutionary at least one

10193
02:49:43,680 --> 02:49:47,190
filter roadblock in going from no life
to space faring life and um

10194
02:49:47,190 --> 02:49:47,200
to space faring life and um
 

10195
02:49:47,200 --> 02:49:49,429
to space faring life and um
where is it is it in front of us or is

10196
02:49:49,429 --> 02:49:49,439
where is it is it in front of us or is
 

10197
02:49:49,439 --> 02:49:50,230
where is it is it in front of us or is
it behind us

10198
02:49:50,230 --> 02:49:50,240
it behind us
 

10199
02:49:50,240 --> 02:49:53,910
it behind us
right if if there's no filter behind us

10200
02:49:53,910 --> 02:49:53,920
right if if there's no filter behind us
 

10201
02:49:53,920 --> 02:49:56,309
right if if there's no filter behind us
and we keep finding all sorts of

10202
02:49:56,309 --> 02:49:56,319
and we keep finding all sorts of
 

10203
02:49:56,319 --> 02:49:59,750
and we keep finding all sorts of
of uh little mice on

10204
02:49:59,750 --> 02:49:59,760
of uh little mice on
 

10205
02:49:59,760 --> 02:50:01,990
of uh little mice on
mars and or whatever right that's

10206
02:50:01,990 --> 02:50:02,000
mars and or whatever right that's
 

10207
02:50:02,000 --> 02:50:03,269
mars and or whatever right that's
actually very depressing because that

10208
02:50:03,269 --> 02:50:03,279
actually very depressing because that
 

10209
02:50:03,279 --> 02:50:04,550
actually very depressing because that
makes it much more likely that the

makes it much more likely that the
 

10211

makes it much more likely that the

and that what actually is going on is
 

10215
02:50:08,160 --> 02:50:09,670
and that what actually is going on is
like the ultimate

like the ultimate
 

10217
02:50:09,680 --> 02:50:12,870
like the ultimate
dark joke that that whenever a

02:50:17,200 --> 02:50:18,950
it's just you just set your clock and
then after a while it goes poof

then after a while it goes poof

all of those are huge vic boosts for our

10260
02:50:54,230 --> 02:50:54,240
all of those are huge vic boosts for our
 

10261
02:50:54,240 --> 02:50:55,110
all of those are huge vic boosts for our
own odds

02:50:55,110 --> 02:50:55,120
own odds
 

10263
02:50:55,120 --> 02:50:58,710
own odds
because been there done that you know

10264
02:50:58,710 --> 02:50:58,720
because been there done that you know
 

10265
02:50:58,720 --> 02:51:00,550
because been there done that you know
it doesn't matter how hard or unlikely

10266
02:51:00,550 --> 02:51:00,560
it doesn't matter how hard or unlikely
 

10267
02:51:00,560 --> 02:51:02,870
it doesn't matter how hard or unlikely
it was that we got past that

10268
02:51:02,870 --> 02:51:02,880
it was that we got past that
 

10269
02:51:02,880 --> 02:51:05,429
it was that we got past that
roadblock because we already did yeah

10270
02:51:05,429 --> 02:51:05,439
roadblock because we already did yeah
 

10271
02:51:05,439 --> 02:51:05,910
roadblock because we already did yeah
and

10272
02:51:05,910 --> 02:51:05,920
and
 

10273
02:51:05,920 --> 02:51:07,910
and
then then that makes it likely that the

10274
02:51:07,910 --> 02:51:07,920
then then that makes it likely that the
 

10275
02:51:07,920 --> 02:51:10,309
then then that makes it likely that the
future is in our own hands we're not

10276
02:51:10,309 --> 02:51:10,319
future is in our own hands we're not
 

10277
02:51:10,319 --> 02:51:14,230
future is in our own hands we're not
doomed so that's why that's why i think

10278
02:51:14,230 --> 02:51:14,240
doomed so that's why that's why i think
 

10279
02:51:14,240 --> 02:51:17,590
doomed so that's why that's why i think
the fact that like that the life is rare

10280
02:51:17,590 --> 02:51:17,600
the fact that like that the life is rare
 

10281
02:51:17,600 --> 02:51:18,870
the fact that like that the life is rare
in the universe it's not just something

10282
02:51:18,870 --> 02:51:18,880
in the universe it's not just something
 

10283
02:51:18,880 --> 02:51:21,590
in the universe it's not just something
that there's some evidence for

10284
02:51:21,590 --> 02:51:21,600
that there's some evidence for
 

10285
02:51:21,600 --> 02:51:23,670
that there's some evidence for
but also something we should actually

10286
02:51:23,670 --> 02:51:23,680
but also something we should actually
 

10287
02:51:23,680 --> 02:51:26,630
but also something we should actually
hope for

10288
02:51:26,630 --> 02:51:26,640

 

10289
02:51:26,640 --> 02:51:29,990

so that's the the end the mortality the

10290
02:51:29,990 --> 02:51:30,000
so that's the the end the mortality the
 

10291
02:51:30,000 --> 02:51:31,670
so that's the the end the mortality the
death of human civilization that we've

10292
02:51:31,670 --> 02:51:31,680
death of human civilization that we've
 

10293
02:51:31,680 --> 02:51:34,070
death of human civilization that we've
been discussing in life maybe prospering

10294
02:51:34,070 --> 02:51:34,080
been discussing in life maybe prospering

you know you lead a research group on
 

10307
02:51:47,520 --> 02:51:49,030
you know you lead a research group on
working some of the biggest questions in

10308
02:51:49,030 --> 02:51:49,040
working some of the biggest questions in

the universe actually
um both on the physics and the ai side

10312
02:51:53,510 --> 02:51:53,520
um both on the physics and the ai side
 

10313
02:51:53,520 --> 02:51:55,349
um both on the physics and the ai side
does it make you sad that you may not be

does it make you sad that you may not be
 

10315
02:51:55,359 --> 02:51:56,550
does it make you sad that you may not be
able to see some of these

10316
02:51:56,550 --> 02:51:56,560
able to see some of these
 

10317
02:51:56,560 --> 02:51:58,870
able to see some of these
exciting things come to fruition that

we've been talking about
 

10321
02:52:00,560 --> 02:52:02,870
we've been talking about
of course of course it sucks the fact

10322
02:52:02,870 --> 02:52:02,880
of course of course it sucks the fact
 

10323
02:52:02,880 --> 02:52:03,910
of course of course it sucks the fact
that i'm going to die

10324
02:52:03,910 --> 02:52:03,920
that i'm going to die
 

10325
02:52:03,920 --> 02:52:06,389
that i'm going to die
and i remember once when i was much

10326
02:52:06,389 --> 02:52:06,399
and i remember once when i was much
 

10327
02:52:06,399 --> 02:52:07,349
and i remember once when i was much
younger

10328
02:52:07,349 --> 02:52:07,359
younger
 

10329
02:52:07,359 --> 02:52:09,590
younger
my dad made this remark that life is

10330
02:52:09,590 --> 02:52:09,600
my dad made this remark that life is
 

10331
02:52:09,600 --> 02:52:11,269
my dad made this remark that life is
fundamentally tragic and i'm like what

10332
02:52:11,269 --> 02:52:11,279
fundamentally tragic and i'm like what
 

10333
02:52:11,279 --> 02:52:13,510
fundamentally tragic and i'm like what
are you talking about that you know

10334
02:52:13,510 --> 02:52:13,520
are you talking about that you know
 

10335
02:52:13,520 --> 02:52:15,990
are you talking about that you know
many years later i i felt now i feel

10336
02:52:15,990 --> 02:52:16,000
many years later i i felt now i feel
 

10337
02:52:16,000 --> 02:52:17,190
many years later i i felt now i feel
like i totally understand what he means

10338
02:52:17,190 --> 02:52:17,200
like i totally understand what he means
 

10339
02:52:17,200 --> 02:52:17,590
like i totally understand what he means
you know

10340
02:52:17,590 --> 02:52:17,600
you know
 

10341
02:52:17,600 --> 02:52:20,150
you know
we grow up very little kids and

10342
02:52:20,150 --> 02:52:20,160
we grow up very little kids and
 

10343
02:52:20,160 --> 02:52:21,830
we grow up very little kids and
everything is infinite and it's so cool

10344
02:52:21,830 --> 02:52:21,840
everything is infinite and it's so cool
 

10345
02:52:21,840 --> 02:52:22,630
everything is infinite and it's so cool
and then suddenly

10346
02:52:22,630 --> 02:52:22,640
and then suddenly
 

10347
02:52:22,640 --> 02:52:25,670
and then suddenly
we find out that actually you know

10348
02:52:25,670 --> 02:52:25,680
we find out that actually you know
 

10349
02:52:25,680 --> 02:52:27,590
we find out that actually you know
you got to only this this is that you

10350
02:52:27,590 --> 02:52:27,600
you got to only this this is that you
 

10351
02:52:27,600 --> 02:52:30,230
you got to only this this is that you
can get game over at some point

10352
02:52:30,230 --> 02:52:30,240
can get game over at some point
 

10353
02:52:30,240 --> 02:52:34,230
can get game over at some point
so of course it's it's it's um

10354
02:52:34,230 --> 02:52:34,240

 

10355
02:52:34,240 --> 02:52:40,830

it's something that's sad uh are you

10356
02:52:40,830 --> 02:52:40,840

 

10357
02:52:40,840 --> 02:52:42,950

afraid

10358
02:52:42,950 --> 02:52:42,960
afraid
 

10359
02:52:42,960 --> 02:52:45,190
afraid
no not in the sense that uh i think

10360
02:52:45,190 --> 02:52:45,200
no not in the sense that uh i think
 

10361
02:52:45,200 --> 02:52:46,710
no not in the sense that uh i think
anything terrible is going to happen

10362
02:52:46,710 --> 02:52:46,720
anything terrible is going to happen
 

10363
02:52:46,720 --> 02:52:48,870
anything terrible is going to happen
after i die or anything like that no i i

10364
02:52:48,870 --> 02:52:48,880
after i die or anything like that no i i
 

10365
02:52:48,880 --> 02:52:50,870
after i die or anything like that no i i
think it's really going to be game over

10366
02:52:50,870 --> 02:52:50,880
think it's really going to be game over
 

10367
02:52:50,880 --> 02:52:54,469
think it's really going to be game over
but it's more that um

10368
02:52:54,469 --> 02:52:54,479

 

10369
02:52:54,479 --> 02:52:56,550

it makes me very acutely aware of i just

10370
02:52:56,550 --> 02:52:56,560
it makes me very acutely aware of i just

i get to be alive right now

10374
02:53:00,150 --> 02:53:00,160
i get to be alive right now
 

10375
02:53:00,160 --> 02:53:03,670

enjoy it because it is finite you know
 

10381
02:53:07,920 --> 02:53:10,150
enjoy it because it is finite you know
and i think actually and we know we all

10382
02:53:10,150 --> 02:53:10,160
and i think actually and we know we all
 

10383
02:53:10,160 --> 02:53:11,269
and i think actually and we know we all
get the

10384
02:53:11,269 --> 02:53:11,279
get the
 

10385
02:53:11,279 --> 02:53:12,790
get the
regular reminders when someone near and

10386
02:53:12,790 --> 02:53:12,800
regular reminders when someone near and
 

10387
02:53:12,800 --> 02:53:14,710
regular reminders when someone near and
dear to us dies that

10388
02:53:14,710 --> 02:53:14,720
dear to us dies that
 

10389
02:53:14,720 --> 02:53:17,830
dear to us dies that
that um

10390
02:53:17,830 --> 02:53:17,840

 

10391
02:53:17,840 --> 02:53:19,190

you know one day it's going to be our

10392
02:53:19,190 --> 02:53:19,200
you know one day it's going to be our
 

10393
02:53:19,200 --> 02:53:21,429
you know one day it's going to be our
turn it adds this kind of focus

10394
02:53:21,429 --> 02:53:21,439
turn it adds this kind of focus
 

10395
02:53:21,439 --> 02:53:23,030
turn it adds this kind of focus
i wonder what it would feel like

10396
02:53:23,030 --> 02:53:23,040
i wonder what it would feel like
 

10397
02:53:23,040 --> 02:53:25,429
i wonder what it would feel like
actually to be an immortal being

10398
02:53:25,429 --> 02:53:25,439
actually to be an immortal being
 

10399
02:53:25,439 --> 02:53:27,590
actually to be an immortal being
if they might even enjoy some of the

10400
02:53:27,590 --> 02:53:27,600
if they might even enjoy some of the
 

10401
02:53:27,600 --> 02:53:28,790
if they might even enjoy some of the
wonderful things of life a little bit

10402
02:53:28,790 --> 02:53:28,800
wonderful things of life a little bit
 

10403
02:53:28,800 --> 02:53:29,349
wonderful things of life a little bit
less

10404
02:53:29,349 --> 02:53:29,359
less
 

10405
02:53:29,359 --> 02:53:33,349
less
just because there isn't that um

10406
02:53:33,349 --> 02:53:33,359
just because there isn't that um
 

10407
02:53:33,359 --> 02:53:35,269
just because there isn't that um
finiteness yeah do you think that could

10408
02:53:35,269 --> 02:53:35,279
finiteness yeah do you think that could
 

10409
02:53:35,279 --> 02:53:40,309
finiteness yeah do you think that could
be a feature not a bug the fact that we

10410
02:53:40,309 --> 02:53:40,319
be a feature not a bug the fact that we
 

10411
02:53:40,319 --> 02:53:43,190
be a feature not a bug the fact that we
beings are finite maybe there's lessons

10412
02:53:43,190 --> 02:53:43,200
beings are finite maybe there's lessons
 

10413
02:53:43,200 --> 02:53:43,670
beings are finite maybe there's lessons
for

10414
02:53:43,670 --> 02:53:43,680
for
 

10415
02:53:43,680 --> 02:53:45,670
for
engineering in artificial intelligence

10416
02:53:45,670 --> 02:53:45,680
engineering in artificial intelligence
 

10417
02:53:45,680 --> 02:53:46,870
engineering in artificial intelligence
systems as well

10418
02:53:46,870 --> 02:53:46,880
systems as well
 

10419
02:53:46,880 --> 02:53:49,510
systems as well
that are conscious like do you think uh

10420
02:53:49,510 --> 02:53:49,520
that are conscious like do you think uh
 

10421
02:53:49,520 --> 02:53:53,830
that are conscious like do you think uh
it makes is it possible

10422
02:53:53,830 --> 02:53:53,840
it makes is it possible
 

10423
02:53:53,840 --> 02:53:55,670
it makes is it possible
that the reason the pistachio ice cream

10424
02:53:55,670 --> 02:53:55,680
that the reason the pistachio ice cream
 

10425
02:53:55,680 --> 02:53:56,950
that the reason the pistachio ice cream
is delicious

10426
02:53:56,950 --> 02:53:56,960
is delicious
 

10427
02:53:56,960 --> 02:53:58,630
is delicious
is the fact that you're going to die one

10428
02:53:58,630 --> 02:53:58,640
is the fact that you're going to die one
 

10429
02:53:58,640 --> 02:54:02,070
is the fact that you're going to die one
day and you will not have

10430
02:54:02,070 --> 02:54:02,080
day and you will not have
 

10431
02:54:02,080 --> 02:54:03,910
day and you will not have
all the pistachio ice cream that you

10432
02:54:03,910 --> 02:54:03,920
all the pistachio ice cream that you
 

10433
02:54:03,920 --> 02:54:05,110
all the pistachio ice cream that you
could eat

10434
02:54:05,110 --> 02:54:05,120
could eat
 

10435
02:54:05,120 --> 02:54:07,269
could eat
because of that fact well let me say two

10436
02:54:07,269 --> 02:54:07,279
because of that fact well let me say two
 

10437
02:54:07,279 --> 02:54:08,389
because of that fact well let me say two
things first of all i

10438
02:54:08,389 --> 02:54:08,399
things first of all i
 

10439
02:54:08,399 --> 02:54:09,830
things first of all i
it's actually quite profound what you're

10440
02:54:09,830 --> 02:54:09,840
it's actually quite profound what you're
 

10441
02:54:09,840 --> 02:54:11,429
it's actually quite profound what you're
saying i do think i appreciate the

10442
02:54:11,429 --> 02:54:11,439
saying i do think i appreciate the
 

10443
02:54:11,439 --> 02:54:12,790
saying i do think i appreciate the
pistachio ice cream a lot more

10444
02:54:12,790 --> 02:54:12,800
pistachio ice cream a lot more
 

10445
02:54:12,800 --> 02:54:15,349
pistachio ice cream a lot more
knowing that i will there's only finite

10446
02:54:15,349 --> 02:54:15,359
knowing that i will there's only finite
 

10447
02:54:15,359 --> 02:54:17,750
knowing that i will there's only finite
number of times i get to enjoy that

10448
02:54:17,750 --> 02:54:17,760
number of times i get to enjoy that
 

10449
02:54:17,760 --> 02:54:19,429
number of times i get to enjoy that
and i can only remember finding a number

10450
02:54:19,429 --> 02:54:19,439
and i can only remember finding a number
 

10451
02:54:19,439 --> 02:54:21,670
and i can only remember finding a number
of times in the past

10452
02:54:21,670 --> 02:54:21,680
of times in the past
 

10453
02:54:21,680 --> 02:54:25,110
of times in the past
and moreover my life is not so long that

10454
02:54:25,110 --> 02:54:25,120
and moreover my life is not so long that
 

10455
02:54:25,120 --> 02:54:26,309
and moreover my life is not so long that
it just starts to feel like things are

10456
02:54:26,309 --> 02:54:26,319
it just starts to feel like things are
 

10457
02:54:26,319 --> 02:54:28,150
it just starts to feel like things are
repeating themselves in general

10458
02:54:28,150 --> 02:54:28,160
repeating themselves in general
 

10459
02:54:28,160 --> 02:54:31,110
repeating themselves in general
it's so new and fresh i also think

10460
02:54:31,110 --> 02:54:31,120
it's so new and fresh i also think
 

10461
02:54:31,120 --> 02:54:34,309
it's so new and fresh i also think
though that

10462
02:54:34,309 --> 02:54:34,319
though that
 

10463
02:54:34,319 --> 02:54:36,389
though that
beth is a little bit overrated and in

10464
02:54:36,389 --> 02:54:36,399
beth is a little bit overrated and in
 

10465
02:54:36,399 --> 02:54:39,510
beth is a little bit overrated and in
the sense that the

10466
02:54:39,510 --> 02:54:39,520

 

10467
02:54:39,520 --> 02:54:43,190

it comes from a sort of outdated view of

10468
02:54:43,190 --> 02:54:43,200
it comes from a sort of outdated view of
 

10469
02:54:43,200 --> 02:54:45,590
it comes from a sort of outdated view of
physics and what life actually is

10470
02:54:45,590 --> 02:54:45,600
physics and what life actually is
 

10471
02:54:45,600 --> 02:54:46,950
physics and what life actually is
because

10472
02:54:46,950 --> 02:54:46,960
because
 

10473
02:54:46,960 --> 02:54:48,550
because
if you ask okay what is it that's going

10474
02:54:48,550 --> 02:54:48,560
if you ask okay what is it that's going
 

10475
02:54:48,560 --> 02:54:50,070
if you ask okay what is it that's going
to die exactly what what

02:54:50,070 --> 02:54:50,080
to die exactly what what
 

10477
02:54:50,080 --> 02:54:53,510
to die exactly what what
am i really when i say it i feel sad

10478
02:54:53,510 --> 02:54:53,520
am i really when i say it i feel sad
 

10479
02:54:53,520 --> 02:54:53,990
am i really when i say it i feel sad
about

10480
02:54:53,990 --> 02:54:54,000
about
 

10481
02:54:54,000 --> 02:54:56,790
about
the idea of myself dying am i really sad

10482
02:54:56,790 --> 02:54:56,800
the idea of myself dying am i really sad
 

10483
02:54:56,800 --> 02:54:59,110
the idea of myself dying am i really sad
that this skin cell here is going to die

10484
02:54:59,110 --> 02:54:59,120
that this skin cell here is going to die
 

10485
02:54:59,120 --> 02:55:00,550
that this skin cell here is going to die
of course not because it's going to die

10486
02:55:00,550 --> 02:55:00,560
of course not because it's going to die
 

10487
02:55:00,560 --> 02:55:02,150
of course not because it's going to die
next week anyway and then i'll grow a

10488
02:55:02,150 --> 02:55:02,160
next week anyway and then i'll grow a
 

10489
02:55:02,160 --> 02:55:02,870
next week anyway and then i'll grow a
new one

10490
02:55:02,870 --> 02:55:02,880
new one
 

10491
02:55:02,880 --> 02:55:05,910
new one
right and it's not any of my cells that

10492
02:55:05,910 --> 02:55:05,920
right and it's not any of my cells that
 

10493
02:55:05,920 --> 02:55:07,510
right and it's not any of my cells that
i'm

10494
02:55:07,510 --> 02:55:07,520
i'm
 

10495
02:55:07,520 --> 02:55:09,510
i'm
associating really with with who i

10496
02:55:09,510 --> 02:55:09,520
associating really with with who i
 

10497
02:55:09,520 --> 02:55:10,870
associating really with with who i
really am

10498
02:55:10,870 --> 02:55:10,880
really am
 

10499
02:55:10,880 --> 02:55:13,030
really am
nor is it any of my atoms or quarks or

10500
02:55:13,030 --> 02:55:13,040
nor is it any of my atoms or quarks or
 

10501
02:55:13,040 --> 02:55:15,510

in fact basically all of my atoms get

10504
02:55:18,389 --> 02:55:18,399
in fact basically all of my atoms get
 

10505
02:55:18,399 --> 02:55:19,269
in fact basically all of my atoms get
replaced

10506
02:55:19,269 --> 02:55:19,279
replaced
 

10507
02:55:19,279 --> 02:55:21,349
replaced
on a regular basis right so what is it

10508
02:55:21,349 --> 02:55:21,359
on a regular basis right so what is it
 

10509
02:55:21,359 --> 02:55:22,710
on a regular basis right so what is it
that's really me

10510
02:55:22,710 --> 02:55:22,720
that's really me
 

10511
02:55:22,720 --> 02:55:24,389
that's really me
from a modern physics perspective it's

10512
02:55:24,389 --> 02:55:24,399
from a modern physics perspective it's
 

10513
02:55:24,399 --> 02:55:27,030
from a modern physics perspective it's
the information

10514
02:55:27,030 --> 02:55:27,040
the information
 

10515
02:55:27,040 --> 02:55:29,830
the information
in processing amy that's where my my

10516
02:55:29,830 --> 02:55:29,840
in processing amy that's where my my
 

10517
02:55:29,840 --> 02:55:31,429
in processing amy that's where my my

that my students feel worthy enough to
 

10565

that my students feel worthy enough to
copy and

10566
02:56:29,830 --> 02:56:29,840
copy and
 

10567
02:56:29,840 --> 02:56:32,630
copy and
adopt some part of things that they know

10568

adopt some part of things that they know
 

10569

10583
02:56:49,040 --> 02:56:51,590

that's something also that contributes

10584
02:56:51,590 --> 02:56:51,600
that's something also that contributes
 

10585
02:56:51,600 --> 02:56:52,389
that's something also that contributes
to making me

10586
02:56:52,389 --> 02:56:52,399
to making me
 

10587
02:56:52,399 --> 02:56:55,670
to making me
a little teeny bit less mortal right

10588
02:56:55,670 --> 02:56:55,680
a little teeny bit less mortal right
 

10589
02:56:55,680 --> 02:56:56,150
a little teeny bit less mortal right
because

10590
02:56:56,150 --> 02:56:56,160
because
 

10591
02:56:56,160 --> 02:56:57,990
because
i'm not at least not all gonna die all

10592
02:56:57,990 --> 02:56:58,000
i'm not at least not all gonna die all
 

10593
02:56:58,000 --> 02:56:59,510
i'm not at least not all gonna die all
at once right

10594
02:56:59,510 --> 02:56:59,520
at once right
 

10595
02:56:59,520 --> 02:57:01,269
at once right
and i find that a beautiful tribute to

10596
02:57:01,269 --> 02:57:01,279
and i find that a beautiful tribute to
 

10597
02:57:01,279 --> 02:57:02,870
and i find that a beautiful tribute to
people we generally respect

10598
02:57:02,870 --> 02:57:02,880
people we generally respect
 

10599
02:57:02,880 --> 02:57:05,750
people we generally respect
if we can if we can remember them and

10600
02:57:05,750 --> 02:57:05,760
if we can if we can remember them and
 

10601
02:57:05,760 --> 02:57:06,230
if we can if we can remember them and
carry

10602
02:57:06,230 --> 02:57:06,240
carry
 

10603
02:57:06,240 --> 02:57:09,349
carry
in us the things that we felt was the

10604
02:57:09,349 --> 02:57:09,359
in us the things that we felt was the
 

10605
02:57:09,359 --> 02:57:11,110
in us the things that we felt was the
most

10606
02:57:11,110 --> 02:57:11,120
most
 

10607
02:57:11,120 --> 02:57:12,870
most
awesome about them right then they live

10608
02:57:12,870 --> 02:57:12,880
awesome about them right then they live
 

10609
02:57:12,880 --> 02:57:15,110
awesome about them right then they live
on

10610
02:57:15,110 --> 02:57:15,120

 

10611
02:57:15,120 --> 02:57:17,110

and i'm getting a bit emotionally ever

10612
02:57:17,110 --> 02:57:17,120
and i'm getting a bit emotionally ever
 

10613
02:57:17,120 --> 02:57:18,870
and i'm getting a bit emotionally ever
but it's a very beautiful idea you bring

10614
02:57:18,870 --> 02:57:18,880
but it's a very beautiful idea you bring
 

10615
02:57:18,880 --> 02:57:19,670
but it's a very beautiful idea you bring
up there

10616
02:57:19,670 --> 02:57:19,680
up there
 

10617
02:57:19,680 --> 02:57:21,750
up there
i think we should stop this

10618
02:57:21,750 --> 02:57:21,760
i think we should stop this
 

10619
02:57:21,760 --> 02:57:23,349
i think we should stop this
old-fashioned materialism and just

10620
02:57:23,349 --> 02:57:23,359
old-fashioned materialism and just
 

10621
02:57:23,359 --> 02:57:23,990
old-fashioned materialism and just
equate

10622
02:57:23,990 --> 02:57:24,000
equate
 

10623
02:57:24,000 --> 02:57:28,550
equate
who we are with our quarks and electrons

10624
02:57:28,550 --> 02:57:28,560
who we are with our quarks and electrons
 

10625
02:57:28,560 --> 02:57:30,230
who we are with our quarks and electrons
there's no scientific basis for that

10626
02:57:30,230 --> 02:57:30,240
there's no scientific basis for that
 

10627
02:57:30,240 --> 02:57:33,030
there's no scientific basis for that
really and

10628
02:57:33,030 --> 02:57:33,040
really and
 

10629
02:57:33,040 --> 02:57:36,550
really and
it's also very uninspiring

10630
02:57:36,550 --> 02:57:36,560
it's also very uninspiring
 

10631
02:57:36,560 --> 02:57:39,030
it's also very uninspiring
now if you look a little bit towards the

10632
02:57:39,030 --> 02:57:39,040
now if you look a little bit towards the
 

10633
02:57:39,040 --> 02:57:39,910
now if you look a little bit towards the
future

10634
02:57:39,910 --> 02:57:39,920
future
 

10635
02:57:39,920 --> 02:57:42,710
future
right one thing which really sucks about

10636
02:57:42,710 --> 02:57:42,720
right one thing which really sucks about
 

10637
02:57:42,720 --> 02:57:44,070
right one thing which really sucks about
humans dying

10638
02:57:44,070 --> 02:57:44,080
humans dying
 

10639
02:57:44,080 --> 02:57:45,590
humans dying
is that even though some of their

10640
02:57:45,590 --> 02:57:45,600
is that even though some of their
 

10641
02:57:45,600 --> 02:57:47,510
is that even though some of their
teachings and memories and stories and

10642
02:57:47,510 --> 02:57:47,520
teachings and memories and stories and
 

10643
02:57:47,520 --> 02:57:50,790
teachings and memories and stories and
and ethics and so on will be copied by

10644
02:57:50,790 --> 02:57:50,800
and ethics and so on will be copied by
 

10645
02:57:50,800 --> 02:57:52,790
and ethics and so on will be copied by
those around them hopefully

10646
02:57:52,790 --> 02:57:52,800
those around them hopefully
 

10647
02:57:52,800 --> 02:57:54,630
those around them hopefully
a lot of it can't be copied and just

10648
02:57:54,630 --> 02:57:54,640
a lot of it can't be copied and just
 

10649
02:57:54,640 --> 02:57:56,309
a lot of it can't be copied and just
dies with them with a brain and that

10650
02:57:56,309 --> 02:57:56,319
dies with them with a brain and that
 

10651
02:57:56,319 --> 02:57:57,110
dies with them with a brain and that
really sucks

10652
02:57:57,110 --> 02:57:57,120
really sucks
 

10653
02:57:57,120 --> 02:57:58,790
really sucks
that that's the fundamental reason why

10654
02:57:58,790 --> 02:57:58,800
that that's the fundamental reason why
 

10655
02:57:58,800 --> 02:58:00,790
that that's the fundamental reason why
we find it so tragic

10656
02:58:00,790 --> 02:58:00,800
we find it so tragic
 

10657
02:58:00,800 --> 02:58:02,630
we find it so tragic
when someone goes from having all this

10658
02:58:02,630 --> 02:58:02,640
when someone goes from having all this
 

10659
02:58:02,640 --> 02:58:03,990
when someone goes from having all this
information there

10660
02:58:03,990 --> 02:58:04,000
information there
 

10661
02:58:04,000 --> 02:58:08,070
information there
more just gone ruined right

10662
02:58:08,070 --> 02:58:08,080
more just gone ruined right
 

10663
02:58:08,080 --> 02:58:10,070
more just gone ruined right
with with uh more post biological

10664
02:58:10,070 --> 02:58:10,080

intelligence
 

10667
02:58:11,760 --> 02:58:15,030
intelligence
that's gonna shift a lot right

10668
02:58:15,030 --> 02:58:15,040
that's gonna shift a lot right
 

10669
02:58:15,040 --> 02:58:16,950
that's gonna shift a lot right
the only reason it's so hard to make a

10670
02:58:16,950 --> 02:58:16,960
the only reason it's so hard to make a
 

10671
02:58:16,960 --> 02:58:18,230
the only reason it's so hard to make a
backup of your brain

10672
02:58:18,230 --> 02:58:18,240
backup of your brain
 

10673
02:58:18,240 --> 02:58:19,750
backup of your brain
in its entirety is exactly because it

10674
02:58:19,750 --> 02:58:19,760
in its entirety is exactly because it
 

10675
02:58:19,760 --> 02:58:21,750
in its entirety is exactly because it
wasn't built for that right

10676
02:58:21,750 --> 02:58:21,760
wasn't built for that right
 

10677
02:58:21,760 --> 02:58:24,070
wasn't built for that right
if you have a future machine

10678

there's no reason for why it has to die

10682
02:58:27,590 --> 02:58:27,600
there's no reason for why it has to die
 

10683
02:58:27,600 --> 02:58:29,349
there's no reason for why it has to die
at all if it wants to up

at all if it wants to up

02:58:29,359 --> 02:58:32,469
at all if it wants to up
if you want to copy it whatever is it

10686
02:58:32,469 --> 02:58:32,479
if you want to copy it whatever is it
 

10687
02:58:32,479 --> 02:58:35,910
if you want to copy it whatever is it
into some other quark blob

10688
02:58:35,910 --> 02:58:35,920
into some other quark blob
 

10689
02:58:35,920 --> 02:58:37,910
into some other quark blob
right you can copy not just sum it but

10690
02:58:37,910 --> 02:58:37,920
right you can copy not just sum it but
 

10691
02:58:37,920 --> 02:58:39,429
right you can copy not just sum it but
all of it right

10692
02:58:39,429 --> 02:58:39,439
all of it right
 

10693
02:58:39,439 --> 02:58:44,870
all of it right
and so so in that sense

10694
02:58:44,870 --> 02:58:44,880

 

10695
02:58:44,880 --> 02:58:47,750

you can get immortality because all the

10696
02:58:47,750 --> 02:58:47,760
you can get immortality because all the
 

10697
02:58:47,760 --> 02:58:49,110
you can get immortality because all the
information can be copied out of any

10698
02:58:49,110 --> 02:58:49,120
information can be copied out of any
 

10699
02:58:49,120 --> 02:58:50,469
information can be copied out of any
individual

10700
02:58:50,469 --> 02:58:50,479
individual
 

10701
02:58:50,479 --> 02:58:52,790
individual
entity uh it's and it's not just

10702
02:58:52,790 --> 02:58:52,800
entity uh it's and it's not just
 

10703
02:58:52,800 --> 02:58:54,950
entity uh it's and it's not just
mortality that will change if we get

10704
02:58:54,950 --> 02:58:54,960
mortality that will change if we get
 

10705
02:58:54,960 --> 02:58:58,070
mortality that will change if we get
more post biological life it's also

10706
02:58:58,070 --> 02:58:58,080
more post biological life it's also
 

10707
02:58:58,080 --> 02:59:00,710
more post biological life it's also
the with that i think very much the

10708
02:59:00,710 --> 02:59:00,720
the with that i think very much the
 

10709
02:59:00,720 --> 02:59:01,269
the with that i think very much the
whole

10710
02:59:01,269 --> 02:59:01,279
whole
 

10711
02:59:01,279 --> 02:59:03,190
whole
individual the whole individualism we

10712
02:59:03,190 --> 02:59:03,200
individual the whole individualism we
 

10713
02:59:03,200 --> 02:59:04,870
individual the whole individualism we
have now right the reason that we make

10714
02:59:04,870 --> 02:59:04,880
have now right the reason that we make
 

10715
02:59:04,880 --> 02:59:06,950
have now right the reason that we make
such a big difference between me

10716
02:59:06,950 --> 02:59:06,960
such a big difference between me
 

10717
02:59:06,960 --> 02:59:09,110
such a big difference between me
and you is exactly because we're a

and you is exactly because we're a
 

10719
02:59:09,120 --> 02:59:10,550
and you is exactly because we're a
little bit limited in how much we can

super intelligent machine but i'm quite

10786
03:00:17,830 --> 03:00:17,840
super intelligent machine but i'm quite
 

10787

super intelligent machine but i'm quite
confident that

10788

confident that
 

10789
03:00:19,520 --> 03:00:21,590

for us mortality and finiteness seems to
 

10799
03:00:30,880 --> 03:00:32,389
for us mortality and finiteness seems to
be pretty important

10800
