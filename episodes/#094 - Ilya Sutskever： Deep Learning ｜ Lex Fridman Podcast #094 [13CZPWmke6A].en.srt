and maybe you could mention how did that
evolve over

170
00:02:49,190 --> 00:02:49,200
evolve over
 

171
00:02:49,200 --> 00:02:51,990
evolve over
the next few years up to today over the

172
00:02:51,990 --> 00:02:52,000
the next few years up to today over the
 

173
00:02:52,000 --> 00:02:53,270
the next few years up to today over the
10 years

174
00:02:53,270 --> 00:02:53,280
10 years
 

175
00:02:53,280 --> 00:02:55,670
10 years
yeah i can answer that question at some

176
00:02:55,670 --> 00:02:55,680
yeah i can answer that question at some
 

177
00:02:55,680 --> 00:02:59,910
yeah i can answer that question at some
point in about 2010 or 2011

178
00:02:59,910 --> 00:02:59,920
point in about 2010 or 2011
 

179
00:02:59,920 --> 00:03:02,830
point in about 2010 or 2011
i connected two facts in my mind

180
00:03:02,830 --> 00:03:02,840
i connected two facts in my mind
 

181
00:03:02,840 --> 00:03:05,190
i connected two facts in my mind
basically

182
00:03:05,190 --> 00:03:05,200
basically
 

183
00:03:05,200 --> 00:03:08,070
basically
the realization was this at some point

184
00:03:08,070 --> 00:03:08,080
the realization was this at some point
 

185
00:03:08,080 --> 00:03:09,670
the realization was this at some point
we realized that we can train

186
00:03:09,670 --> 00:03:09,680
we realized that we can train
 

187
00:03:09,680 --> 00:03:11,910
we realized that we can train
very large i shouldn't say very you know

188
00:03:11,910 --> 00:03:11,920
very large i shouldn't say very you know
 

189
00:03:11,920 --> 00:03:14,309
very large i shouldn't say very you know
they're tiny by today's standards but

190
00:03:14,309 --> 00:03:14,319
they're tiny by today's standards but
 

191
00:03:14,319 --> 00:03:16,790
they're tiny by today's standards but
large and deep neural networks end to

192
00:03:16,790 --> 00:03:16,800
large and deep neural networks end to
 

193
00:03:16,800 --> 00:03:18,470
large and deep neural networks end to
end with back propagation

194
00:03:18,470 --> 00:03:18,480
end with back propagation
 

195
00:03:18,480 --> 00:03:21,589
end with back propagation
at some point different people obtained

196
00:03:21,589 --> 00:03:21,599
at some point different people obtained
 

197
00:03:21,599 --> 00:03:23,750
at some point different people obtained
this result i obtained this result

198
00:03:23,750 --> 00:03:23,760
this result i obtained this result
 

199
00:03:23,760 --> 00:03:25,830

the first the first moment in which i

200

the first the first moment in which i
 

201
00:03:25,840 --> 00:03:27,589
the first the first moment in which i
realized that

202
00:03:27,589 --> 00:03:27,599
realized that
 

203
00:03:27,599 --> 00:03:29,030
realized that
deep neural networks are powerful was

204
00:03:29,030 --> 00:03:29,040
deep neural networks are powerful was
 

205
00:03:29,040 --> 00:03:30,789
deep neural networks are powerful was
when james martens invented the

206
00:03:30,789 --> 00:03:30,799
when james martens invented the
 

207
00:03:30,799 --> 00:03:32,149
when james martens invented the
hessian-free optimizer

208
00:03:32,149 --> 00:03:32,159
hessian-free optimizer
 

209
00:03:32,159 --> 00:03:35,270
hessian-free optimizer
in 2010 and he trained a 10-layer neural

210
00:03:35,270 --> 00:03:35,280
in 2010 and he trained a 10-layer neural
 

211
00:03:35,280 --> 00:03:36,229
in 2010 and he trained a 10-layer neural
network

212
00:03:36,229 --> 00:03:36,239
network
 

213
00:03:36,239 --> 00:03:39,589

00:03:39,589 --> 00:03:39,599
end-to-end without pre-training
 

215
00:03:39,599 --> 00:03:42,550
end-to-end without pre-training
from scratch and when that happened i

216
00:03:42,550 --> 00:03:42,560
from scratch and when that happened i
 

217
00:03:42,560 --> 00:03:43,830
from scratch and when that happened i
thought this is it

218
00:03:43,830 --> 00:03:43,840
thought this is it
 

219
00:03:43,840 --> 00:03:45,190
thought this is it
because if you can train a big neural

220
00:03:45,190 --> 00:03:45,200
because if you can train a big neural
 

221
00:03:45,200 --> 00:03:46,470
because if you can train a big neural
network a big neural network can

222
00:03:46,470 --> 00:03:46,480
network a big neural network can
 

223
00:03:46,480 --> 00:03:47,190
network a big neural network can
represent

224
00:03:47,190 --> 00:03:47,200
represent
 

225
00:03:47,200 --> 00:03:49,830
represent
very complicated function because if you

226
00:03:49,830 --> 00:03:49,840
very complicated function because if you
 

227
00:03:49,840 --> 00:03:52,550
very complicated function because if you
have a neural network with 10 layers

228
00:03:52,550 --> 00:03:52,560
have a neural network with 10 layers
 

229
00:03:52,560 --> 00:03:55,110
have a neural network with 10 layers
it's as though you allow the human brain

230
00:03:55,110 --> 00:03:55,120
it's as though you allow the human brain
 

231
00:03:55,120 --> 00:03:56,869
it's as though you allow the human brain
to run for

232
00:03:56,869 --> 00:03:56,879
to run for
 

233
00:03:56,879 --> 00:03:58,630
to run for
some number of milliseconds neuron

234
00:03:58,630 --> 00:03:58,640
some number of milliseconds neuron
 

235
00:03:58,640 --> 00:04:00,309
some number of milliseconds neuron
firings are slow

236
00:04:00,309 --> 00:04:00,319
firings are slow
 

237
00:04:00,319 --> 00:04:03,350
firings are slow
and so in maybe 100 milliseconds your

238
00:04:03,350 --> 00:04:03,360
and so in maybe 100 milliseconds your
 

239
00:04:03,360 --> 00:04:05,110
and so in maybe 100 milliseconds your
neurons only fire 10 times so it's also

240
00:04:05,110 --> 00:04:05,120
neurons only fire 10 times so it's also
 

241
00:04:05,120 --> 00:04:06,630
neurons only fire 10 times so it's also
kind of like 10 layers

242
00:04:06,630 --> 00:04:06,640
kind of like 10 layers
 

243
00:04:06,640 --> 00:04:08,309
kind of like 10 layers
and in 100 milliseconds you can

244
00:04:08,309 --> 00:04:08,319
and in 100 milliseconds you can
 

245
00:04:08,319 --> 00:04:10,390
and in 100 milliseconds you can
perfectly recognize any object

246
00:04:10,390 --> 00:04:10,400
perfectly recognize any object
 

247
00:04:10,400 --> 00:04:12,789
perfectly recognize any object
so i thought so i already had the idea

248
00:04:12,789 --> 00:04:12,799
so i thought so i already had the idea
 

249
00:04:12,799 --> 00:04:14,070
so i thought so i already had the idea
then that we need to train a very big

250
00:04:14,070 --> 00:04:14,080
then that we need to train a very big
 

251
00:04:14,080 --> 00:04:15,990
then that we need to train a very big
neural network

252
00:04:15,990 --> 00:04:16,000
neural network
 

253
00:04:16,000 --> 00:04:18,469
neural network
on lots of supervised data and then it

254
00:04:18,469 --> 00:04:18,479
on lots of supervised data and then it
 

255
00:04:18,479 --> 00:04:20,069
on lots of supervised data and then it
must succeed because we can find the

256
00:04:20,069 --> 00:04:20,079
must succeed because we can find the
 

257
00:04:20,079 --> 00:04:21,189
must succeed because we can find the
best neural network

258
00:04:21,189 --> 00:04:21,199
best neural network
 

259
00:04:21,199 --> 00:04:22,950
best neural network
and then there's also theory that if you

260
00:04:22,950 --> 00:04:22,960
and then there's also theory that if you
 

261
00:04:22,960 --> 00:04:24,310
and then there's also theory that if you
have more data than parameters

262
00:04:24,310 --> 00:04:24,320
have more data than parameters
 

263
00:04:24,320 --> 00:04:26,469
have more data than parameters
you won't overfit today we know that

264
00:04:26,469 --> 00:04:26,479
you won't overfit today we know that
 

265
00:04:26,479 --> 00:04:27,990
you won't overfit today we know that
actually this theory is very incomplete

266
00:04:27,990 --> 00:04:28,000
actually this theory is very incomplete
 

267
00:04:28,000 --> 00:04:29,189
actually this theory is very incomplete
and you want overfitting when you have

268
00:04:29,189 --> 00:04:29,199
and you want overfitting when you have
 

269
00:04:29,199 --> 00:04:31,189
and you want overfitting when you have
less data than parameters but definitely

270
00:04:31,189 --> 00:04:31,199
less data than parameters but definitely
 

271
00:04:31,199 --> 00:04:32,390
less data than parameters but definitely
if you have more data than parameters

272
00:04:32,390 --> 00:04:32,400
if you have more data than parameters
 

273
00:04:32,400 --> 00:04:34,230
if you have more data than parameters
you want overfit so the fact that neural

274
00:04:34,230 --> 00:04:34,240
you want overfit so the fact that neural
 

275
00:04:34,240 --> 00:04:35,830
you want overfit so the fact that neural
networks were heavily

276
00:04:35,830 --> 00:04:35,840
networks were heavily
 

277
00:04:35,840 --> 00:04:38,629
networks were heavily
over parametrized wasn't discouraging to

278
00:04:38,629 --> 00:04:38,639
over parametrized wasn't discouraging to
 

279
00:04:38,639 --> 00:04:39,030
over parametrized wasn't discouraging to
you

280
00:04:39,030 --> 00:04:39,040
you
 

281
00:04:39,040 --> 00:04:40,790
you
so you you were thinking about the

282
00:04:40,790 --> 00:04:40,800
so you you were thinking about the
 

283
00:04:40,800 --> 00:04:42,950
so you you were thinking about the
theory that the number of parameters

284
00:04:42,950 --> 00:04:42,960
theory that the number of parameters
 

285
00:04:42,960 --> 00:04:44,230
theory that the number of parameters
the fact there's a huge number of

286
00:04:44,230 --> 00:04:44,240
the fact there's a huge number of
 

287
00:04:44,240 --> 00:04:45,909
the fact there's a huge number of
parameters is okay it's gonna be okay i

288
00:04:45,909 --> 00:04:45,919
parameters is okay it's gonna be okay i
 

289
00:04:45,919 --> 00:04:47,350
parameters is okay it's gonna be okay i
mean there was some evidence before that

290
00:04:47,350 --> 00:04:47,360
mean there was some evidence before that
 

291
00:04:47,360 --> 00:04:49,430
mean there was some evidence before that
it was okayish but the theory was most

292
00:04:49,430 --> 00:04:49,440
it was okayish but the theory was most
 

293
00:04:49,440 --> 00:04:50,950
it was okayish but the theory was most
the theory was that if you had a big

294
00:04:50,950 --> 00:04:50,960
the theory was that if you had a big
 

295
00:04:50,960 --> 00:04:52,230
the theory was that if you had a big
data set and a big neural net it was

296
00:04:52,230 --> 00:04:52,240
data set and a big neural net it was
 

297
00:04:52,240 --> 00:04:52,950
data set and a big neural net it was
going to work

298
00:04:52,950 --> 00:04:52,960
going to work
 

299
00:04:52,960 --> 00:04:54,310
going to work
the over parameterization just didn't

300
00:04:54,310 --> 00:04:54,320
the over parameterization just didn't
 

301
00:04:54,320 --> 00:04:57,030
the over parameterization just didn't
really um figure much as a problem i

302
00:04:57,030 --> 00:04:57,040
really um figure much as a problem i
 

303
00:04:57,040 --> 00:04:57,990
really um figure much as a problem i
thought well with images you're just

304
00:04:57,990 --> 00:04:58,000
thought well with images you're just
 

305
00:04:58,000 --> 00:04:59,350
thought well with images you're just
going to add some data augmentation it's

306
00:04:59,350 --> 00:04:59,360
going to add some data augmentation it's
 

307
00:04:59,360 --> 00:05:00,310
going to add some data augmentation it's
going to be okay

308
00:05:00,310 --> 00:05:00,320
going to be okay
 

309
00:05:00,320 --> 00:05:02,629
going to be okay
so where was any doubt coming from the

310
00:05:02,629 --> 00:05:02,639
so where was any doubt coming from the
 

311
00:05:02,639 --> 00:05:04,310
so where was any doubt coming from the
main doubt was can we train a bigger

312
00:05:04,310 --> 00:05:04,320
main doubt was can we train a bigger
 

313
00:05:04,320 --> 00:05:05,670
main doubt was can we train a bigger
will we have enough computer trainer big

314
00:05:05,670 --> 00:05:05,680
will we have enough computer trainer big
 

315
00:05:05,680 --> 00:05:07,430
will we have enough computer trainer big
enough neural net with back propagation

the brain and they invented the neuron
 

415
00:06:34,240 --> 00:06:35,830
the brain and they invented the neuron

so they were inspired by it back then
then you had the convolutional neural

then you had the convolutional neural
 

419
00:06:37,120 --> 00:06:38,469
then you had the convolutional neural

artificial neural networks so we all

486
00:07:37,430 --> 00:07:37,440
artificial neural networks so we all
 

487
00:07:37,440 --> 00:07:38,629

495
00:07:43,840 --> 00:07:45,430

some ways in which artificial neural
 

497
00:07:45,440 --> 00:07:46,150
some ways in which artificial neural
networks

498
00:07:46,150 --> 00:07:46,160
networks
 

499
00:07:46,160 --> 00:07:48,550
networks
have a number of very important

500
00:07:48,550 --> 00:07:48,560
have a number of very important
 

501
00:07:48,560 --> 00:07:50,070
have a number of very important
advantages over the brain

502
00:07:50,070 --> 00:07:50,080
advantages over the brain
 

503
00:07:50,080 --> 00:07:51,670
advantages over the brain
look looking at the advantages versus

504
00:07:51,670 --> 00:07:51,680
look looking at the advantages versus
 

505
00:07:51,680 --> 00:07:53,589
look looking at the advantages versus
disadvantages is a good way to figure

506
00:07:53,589 --> 00:07:53,599
disadvantages is a good way to figure
 

507
00:07:53,599 --> 00:07:55,589
disadvantages is a good way to figure
out what is the important difference

508
00:07:55,589 --> 00:07:55,599
out what is the important difference
 

509
00:07:55,599 --> 00:07:58,710
out what is the important difference
so the brain uses spikes which may or

510
00:07:58,710 --> 00:07:58,720
so the brain uses spikes which may or
 

511
00:07:58,720 --> 00:07:59,909
so the brain uses spikes which may or
may not be important

512
00:07:59,909 --> 00:07:59,919
may not be important
 

513
00:07:59,919 --> 00:08:00,869
may not be important
yeah that's a really interesting

514
00:08:00,869 --> 00:08:00,879
yeah that's a really interesting
 

515
00:08:00,879 --> 00:08:02,550
yeah that's a really interesting
question do you think it's important or

516
00:08:02,550 --> 00:08:02,560
question do you think it's important or
 

517
00:08:02,560 --> 00:08:03,749
question do you think it's important or
not

518
00:08:03,749 --> 00:08:03,759
not
 

519
00:08:03,759 --> 00:08:06,230
not
that's one big architectural difference

520
00:08:06,230 --> 00:08:06,240
that's one big architectural difference
 

521
00:08:06,240 --> 00:08:08,230
that's one big architectural difference
between artificial neural networks and

522
00:08:08,230 --> 00:08:08,240
between artificial neural networks and
 

523
00:08:08,240 --> 00:08:10,869
between artificial neural networks and
it's hard to tell but my prior is not

524
00:08:10,869 --> 00:08:10,879
it's hard to tell but my prior is not
 

525
00:08:10,879 --> 00:08:12,070
it's hard to tell but my prior is not
very high and i can

526
00:08:12,070 --> 00:08:12,080
very high and i can
 

527
00:08:12,080 --> 00:08:13,749
very high and i can
i can say why you know there are people

528
00:08:13,749 --> 00:08:13,759
i can say why you know there are people
 

529
00:08:13,759 --> 00:08:14,869
i can say why you know there are people
who are interested in spiking neural

530
00:08:14,869 --> 00:08:14,879
who are interested in spiking neural
 

531
00:08:14,879 --> 00:08:16,390
who are interested in spiking neural
networks and basically

532
00:08:16,390 --> 00:08:16,400
networks and basically
 

533
00:08:16,400 --> 00:08:18,469
networks and basically
what they figured out is that they need

534
00:08:18,469 --> 00:08:18,479
what they figured out is that they need
 

535
00:08:18,479 --> 00:08:19,510
what they figured out is that they need
to simulate the

536
00:08:19,510 --> 00:08:19,520
to simulate the
 

537
00:08:19,520 --> 00:08:22,629
to simulate the
non-spiking neural networks in spikes

538
00:08:22,629 --> 00:08:22,639
non-spiking neural networks in spikes
 

539
00:08:22,639 --> 00:08:23,990
non-spiking neural networks in spikes
and that's how they're gonna make them

540
00:08:23,990 --> 00:08:24,000
and that's how they're gonna make them
 

541
00:08:24,000 --> 00:08:25,510
and that's how they're gonna make them
work if you don't simulate the non-spike

542
00:08:25,510 --> 00:08:25,520
work if you don't simulate the non-spike
 

543
00:08:25,520 --> 00:08:27,189
work if you don't simulate the non-spike
in neural networks in spikes it's not

544
00:08:27,189 --> 00:08:27,199
in neural networks in spikes it's not
 

545
00:08:27,199 --> 00:08:28,469
in neural networks in spikes it's not
going to work because the question is

546
00:08:28,469 --> 00:08:28,479
going to work because the question is
 

547
00:08:28,479 --> 00:08:29,430
going to work because the question is
why should it work

548
00:08:29,430 --> 00:08:29,440
why should it work
 

549
00:08:29,440 --> 00:08:30,550
why should it work
and that connects to questions around

550
00:08:30,550 --> 00:08:30,560
and that connects to questions around
 

551
00:08:30,560 --> 00:08:33,829
and that connects to questions around
back propagation and questions around

552
00:08:33,829 --> 00:08:33,839
back propagation and questions around
 

553
00:08:33,839 --> 00:08:35,990
back propagation and questions around
deep learning you got this giant neural

554
00:08:35,990 --> 00:08:36,000
deep learning you got this giant neural
 

555
00:08:36,000 --> 00:08:38,310
deep learning you got this giant neural
network why should it work at all

556
00:08:38,310 --> 00:08:38,320
network why should it work at all
 

557
00:08:38,320 --> 00:08:43,110
network why should it work at all
why should the learning rule work at all

558
00:08:43,110 --> 00:08:43,120

 

559
00:08:43,120 --> 00:08:44,550

it's not a self-evident question

560
00:08:44,550 --> 00:08:44,560
it's not a self-evident question
 

561
00:08:44,560 --> 00:08:46,389
it's not a self-evident question
especially if you let's say if you were

562
00:08:46,389 --> 00:08:46,399
especially if you let's say if you were
 

563
00:08:46,399 --> 00:08:47,750
especially if you let's say if you were
just starting in the field and you read

564
00:08:47,750 --> 00:08:47,760
just starting in the field and you read
 

565
00:08:47,760 --> 00:08:49,190
just starting in the field and you read
the very early papers

566
00:08:49,190 --> 00:08:49,200
the very early papers
 

567
00:08:49,200 --> 00:08:51,990
the very early papers
you can say hey people are saying let's

568
00:08:51,990 --> 00:08:52,000
you can say hey people are saying let's
 

569
00:08:52,000 --> 00:08:53,509
you can say hey people are saying let's
build neural networks

570
00:08:53,509 --> 00:08:53,519
build neural networks
 

571
00:08:53,519 --> 00:08:55,110
build neural networks
that's a great idea because the brain is

572
00:08:55,110 --> 00:08:55,120
that's a great idea because the brain is
 

573
00:08:55,120 --> 00:08:56,550
that's a great idea because the brain is
a neural network so it would be useful

574
00:08:56,550 --> 00:08:56,560
a neural network so it would be useful
 

575
00:08:56,560 --> 00:08:57,990
a neural network so it would be useful
to build neural networks

576
00:08:57,990 --> 00:08:58,000
to build neural networks
 

577
00:08:58,000 --> 00:09:00,310
to build neural networks
now let's figure out how to train them

578
00:09:00,310 --> 00:09:00,320
now let's figure out how to train them
 

579
00:09:00,320 --> 00:09:01,590
now let's figure out how to train them
it should be possible to train them

580
00:09:01,590 --> 00:09:01,600
it should be possible to train them
 

581
00:09:01,600 --> 00:09:03,350
it should be possible to train them
properly but how

582
00:09:03,350 --> 00:09:03,360
properly but how
 

583
00:09:03,360 --> 00:09:07,110
properly but how
and so the big idea is the cost function

584
00:09:07,110 --> 00:09:07,120
and so the big idea is the cost function
 

585
00:09:07,120 --> 00:09:10,150
and so the big idea is the cost function
that's the big idea the cost function

586
00:09:10,150 --> 00:09:10,160
that's the big idea the cost function
 

587
00:09:10,160 --> 00:09:11,910
that's the big idea the cost function
is a way of measuring the performance of

588
00:09:11,910 --> 00:09:11,920
is a way of measuring the performance of
 

589
00:09:11,920 --> 00:09:14,150
is a way of measuring the performance of
the system according to some

590
00:09:14,150 --> 00:09:14,160
the system according to some
 

591
00:09:14,160 --> 00:09:16,310
the system according to some
measure by the way that is a big

592
00:09:16,310 --> 00:09:16,320
measure by the way that is a big
 

593
00:09:16,320 --> 00:09:17,670
measure by the way that is a big
actually let me think is that

594
00:09:17,670 --> 00:09:17,680
actually let me think is that
 

595
00:09:17,680 --> 00:09:20,470
actually let me think is that
is that uh one a difficult idea to

596
00:09:20,470 --> 00:09:20,480
is that uh one a difficult idea to
 

597
00:09:20,480 --> 00:09:21,110
is that uh one a difficult idea to
arrive at

598
00:09:21,110 --> 00:09:21,120
arrive at
 

599
00:09:21,120 --> 00:09:22,790
arrive at
and how big of an idea is that that

600
00:09:22,790 --> 00:09:22,800
and how big of an idea is that that
 

601
00:09:22,800 --> 00:09:26,790
and how big of an idea is that that
there's a single cost function

602
00:09:26,790 --> 00:09:26,800

 

603
00:09:26,800 --> 00:09:29,030

let me sorry let me take a pause is

604
00:09:29,030 --> 00:09:29,040
let me sorry let me take a pause is
 

605
00:09:29,040 --> 00:09:30,630
let me sorry let me take a pause is
supervised learning

606
00:09:30,630 --> 00:09:30,640
supervised learning
 

607
00:09:30,640 --> 00:09:33,509
supervised learning
a difficult concept to come to i don't

608
00:09:33,509 --> 00:09:33,519
a difficult concept to come to i don't
 

609
00:09:33,519 --> 00:09:34,550
a difficult concept to come to i don't
know

610
00:09:34,550 --> 00:09:34,560
know
 

611
00:09:34,560 --> 00:09:36,389
know
all concepts are very easy in retrospect

612
00:09:36,389 --> 00:09:36,399
all concepts are very easy in retrospect
 

613
00:09:36,399 --> 00:09:37,990
all concepts are very easy in retrospect
yeah that's what it seems trivial now

614
00:09:37,990 --> 00:09:38,000
yeah that's what it seems trivial now
 

615
00:09:38,000 --> 00:09:38,550
yeah that's what it seems trivial now
but i

616
00:09:38,550 --> 00:09:38,560
but i
 

617
00:09:38,560 --> 00:09:40,230
but i
so because because the reason i asked

618
00:09:40,230 --> 00:09:40,240
so because because the reason i asked
 

619
00:09:40,240 --> 00:09:41,750
so because because the reason i asked
that and we'll talk about it because is

620
00:09:41,750 --> 00:09:41,760
that and we'll talk about it because is
 

621
00:09:41,760 --> 00:09:42,949
that and we'll talk about it because is
there other

622
00:09:42,949 --> 00:09:42,959
there other
 

623
00:09:42,959 --> 00:09:45,110
there other
things is there things that don't

624
00:09:45,110 --> 00:09:45,120
things is there things that don't
 

625
00:09:45,120 --> 00:09:46,310
things is there things that don't
necessarily have

626
00:09:46,310 --> 00:09:46,320
necessarily have
 

627
00:09:46,320 --> 00:09:48,150
necessarily have
a cost function maybe have many cost

628
00:09:48,150 --> 00:09:48,160
a cost function maybe have many cost
 

629
00:09:48,160 --> 00:09:49,509
a cost function maybe have many cost
functions or maybe have

630
00:09:49,509 --> 00:09:49,519
functions or maybe have
 

631
00:09:49,519 --> 00:09:51,829
functions or maybe have
dynamic cost functions or maybe a

632
00:09:51,829 --> 00:09:51,839
dynamic cost functions or maybe a
 

633
00:09:51,839 --> 00:09:54,070
dynamic cost functions or maybe a
totally different kind of architectures

634
00:09:54,070 --> 00:09:54,080
totally different kind of architectures
 

635
00:09:54,080 --> 00:09:55,430
totally different kind of architectures
because we have to think like that in

636
00:09:55,430 --> 00:09:55,440
because we have to think like that in
 

637
00:09:55,440 --> 00:09:57,829
because we have to think like that in
order to arrive at something new right

638
00:09:57,829 --> 00:09:57,839
order to arrive at something new right
 

639
00:09:57,839 --> 00:09:59,590
order to arrive at something new right
so the only so the good examples of

640
00:09:59,590 --> 00:09:59,600
so the only so the good examples of
 

641
00:09:59,600 --> 00:10:01,030
so the only so the good examples of
things which don't have clear cost

642
00:10:01,030 --> 00:10:01,040
things which don't have clear cost
 

643
00:10:01,040 --> 00:10:04,150
things which don't have clear cost
functions are gans

644
00:10:04,150 --> 00:10:04,160
functions are gans
 

645
00:10:04,160 --> 00:10:06,150
functions are gans
again you have a game so instead of

646
00:10:06,150 --> 00:10:06,160
again you have a game so instead of
 

647
00:10:06,160 --> 00:10:08,069
again you have a game so instead of
thinking of a cost function

648
00:10:08,069 --> 00:10:08,079
thinking of a cost function
 

649
00:10:08,079 --> 00:10:09,829
thinking of a cost function
where you want to optimize where you

650
00:10:09,829 --> 00:10:09,839
where you want to optimize where you
 

651
00:10:09,839 --> 00:10:11,590
where you want to optimize where you
know that you have an algorithm gradient

652
00:10:11,590 --> 00:10:11,600
know that you have an algorithm gradient
 

653
00:10:11,600 --> 00:10:13,190
know that you have an algorithm gradient
descent which will optimize the cost

654
00:10:13,190 --> 00:10:13,200
descent which will optimize the cost
 

655
00:10:13,200 --> 00:10:13,829
descent which will optimize the cost
function

656
00:10:13,829 --> 00:10:13,839
function
 

657
00:10:13,839 --> 00:10:15,110
function
and then you can reason about the

658
00:10:15,110 --> 00:10:15,120
and then you can reason about the
 

659
00:10:15,120 --> 00:10:16,949
and then you can reason about the
behavior of your system in terms of what

660
00:10:16,949 --> 00:10:16,959
behavior of your system in terms of what
 

661
00:10:16,959 --> 00:10:17,990
behavior of your system in terms of what
it optimizes

662
00:10:17,990 --> 00:10:18,000
it optimizes
 

663
00:10:18,000 --> 00:10:20,150
it optimizes
with again you say i have a game and

664
00:10:20,150 --> 00:10:20,160
with again you say i have a game and
 

665
00:10:20,160 --> 00:10:21,030
with again you say i have a game and
i'll reason

666
00:10:21,030 --> 00:10:21,040
i'll reason
 

667
00:10:21,040 --> 00:10:22,230
i'll reason
about the behavior of the system in

668
00:10:22,230 --> 00:10:22,240
about the behavior of the system in
 

669
00:10:22,240 --> 00:10:24,389
about the behavior of the system in
terms of the equilibrium of the game

670
00:10:24,389 --> 00:10:24,399
terms of the equilibrium of the game
 

671
00:10:24,399 --> 00:10:25,590
terms of the equilibrium of the game
but it's all about coming up with these

672
00:10:25,590 --> 00:10:25,600
but it's all about coming up with these
 

673
00:10:25,600 --> 00:10:27,110
but it's all about coming up with these
mathematical objects that help us reason

674
00:10:27,110 --> 00:10:27,120
mathematical objects that help us reason
 

675
00:10:27,120 --> 00:10:27,990
mathematical objects that help us reason
about

676
00:10:27,990 --> 00:10:28,000
about
 

677
00:10:28,000 --> 00:10:30,389
about
the behavior of our system right that's

678
00:10:30,389 --> 00:10:30,399
the behavior of our system right that's
 

679
00:10:30,399 --> 00:10:32,069
the behavior of our system right that's
really interesting yes again is the only

680
00:10:32,069 --> 00:10:32,079
really interesting yes again is the only
 

681
00:10:32,079 --> 00:10:33,269
really interesting yes again is the only
one it's kind of a com

682
00:10:33,269 --> 00:10:33,279
one it's kind of a com
 

683
00:10:33,279 --> 00:10:35,670
one it's kind of a com
the cost function is emergent from the

684
00:10:35,670 --> 00:10:35,680
the cost function is emergent from the
 

685
00:10:35,680 --> 00:10:37,030
the cost function is emergent from the
comparison

686
00:10:37,030 --> 00:10:37,040
comparison
 

687
00:10:37,040 --> 00:10:38,389
comparison
it's i don't i don't know if it has a

688
00:10:38,389 --> 00:10:38,399
it's i don't i don't know if it has a
 

689
00:10:38,399 --> 00:10:39,269
it's i don't i don't know if it has a
cost function i don't know if it's

690
00:10:39,269 --> 00:10:39,279
cost function i don't know if it's
 

691
00:10:39,279 --> 00:10:40,389
cost function i don't know if it's
meaningful to talk about the cost

692
00:10:40,389 --> 00:10:40,399
meaningful to talk about the cost
 

693
00:10:40,399 --> 00:10:41,190
meaningful to talk about the cost
function of again

694
00:10:41,190 --> 00:10:41,200
function of again
 

695
00:10:41,200 --> 00:10:42,870
function of again
it's kind of like the cost function of

696
00:10:42,870 --> 00:10:42,880
it's kind of like the cost function of
 

697
00:10:42,880 --> 00:10:44,230
it's kind of like the cost function of
biological evolution or the cost

698
00:10:44,230 --> 00:10:44,240
biological evolution or the cost
 

699
00:10:44,240 --> 00:10:45,590
biological evolution or the cost
function of the economy

700
00:10:45,590 --> 00:10:45,600
function of the economy
 

701
00:10:45,600 --> 00:10:48,949
function of the economy
it's you can talk about

702
00:10:48,949 --> 00:10:48,959
it's you can talk about
 

703
00:10:48,959 --> 00:10:51,269
it's you can talk about
regions to which it will go towards but

704
00:10:51,269 --> 00:10:51,279
regions to which it will go towards but
 

705
00:10:51,279 --> 00:10:55,110
regions to which it will go towards but
i don't think

706
00:10:55,110 --> 00:10:55,120

 

707
00:10:55,120 --> 00:10:56,550

i don't think the cost function analogy

708
00:10:56,550 --> 00:10:56,560
i don't think the cost function analogy
 

709
00:10:56,560 --> 00:10:58,310
i don't think the cost function analogy
is the most useful so if evolution

710
00:10:58,310 --> 00:10:58,320
is the most useful so if evolution
 

711
00:10:58,320 --> 00:10:59,110
is the most useful so if evolution
doesn't

712
00:10:59,110 --> 00:10:59,120
doesn't
 

713
00:10:59,120 --> 00:11:00,470
doesn't
that's really interesting so if

714
00:11:00,470 --> 00:11:00,480
that's really interesting so if
 

715
00:11:00,480 --> 00:11:01,990
that's really interesting so if
evolution doesn't really have a cost

716
00:11:01,990 --> 00:11:02,000
evolution doesn't really have a cost
 

717
00:11:02,000 --> 00:11:02,550
evolution doesn't really have a cost
function

718
00:11:02,550 --> 00:11:02,560
function
 

719
00:11:02,560 --> 00:11:06,630
function
like a cost function based on its

720
00:11:06,630 --> 00:11:06,640

 

721
00:11:06,640 --> 00:11:09,269

something akin to our mathematical

722
00:11:09,269 --> 00:11:09,279
something akin to our mathematical
 

723
00:11:09,279 --> 00:11:11,110
something akin to our mathematical
conception of a cost function

724
00:11:11,110 --> 00:11:11,120
conception of a cost function
 

725
00:11:11,120 --> 00:11:12,949
conception of a cost function
then do you think cost functions in deep

726
00:11:12,949 --> 00:11:12,959
then do you think cost functions in deep
 

727
00:11:12,959 --> 00:11:15,030
then do you think cost functions in deep
learning are holding us back

728
00:11:15,030 --> 00:11:15,040
learning are holding us back
 

729
00:11:15,040 --> 00:11:17,430
learning are holding us back
yeah i so you just kind of mentioned

730
00:11:17,430 --> 00:11:17,440
yeah i so you just kind of mentioned
 

731
00:11:17,440 --> 00:11:19,509
yeah i so you just kind of mentioned
that cost function is a nice first

732
00:11:19,509 --> 00:11:19,519
that cost function is a nice first
 

733
00:11:19,519 --> 00:11:22,310
that cost function is a nice first
profound idea do you think that's a good

734
00:11:22,310 --> 00:11:22,320
profound idea do you think that's a good
 

735
00:11:22,320 --> 00:11:23,190
profound idea do you think that's a good
idea

736
00:11:23,190 --> 00:11:23,200
idea
 

737
00:11:23,200 --> 00:11:26,630
idea
do you think it's an idea will go past

738
00:11:26,630 --> 00:11:26,640
do you think it's an idea will go past
 

739
00:11:26,640 --> 00:11:28,790
do you think it's an idea will go past
so self-play starts to touch on that a

740
00:11:28,790 --> 00:11:28,800
so self-play starts to touch on that a
 

741
00:11:28,800 --> 00:11:31,030
so self-play starts to touch on that a
little bit uh in reinforcement learning

742
00:11:31,030 --> 00:11:31,040
little bit uh in reinforcement learning
 

743
00:11:31,040 --> 00:11:33,269
little bit uh in reinforcement learning
systems that's right self-play and also

744
00:11:33,269 --> 00:11:33,279
systems that's right self-play and also
 

745
00:11:33,279 --> 00:11:34,949
systems that's right self-play and also
ideas around exploration where you're

746
00:11:34,949 --> 00:11:34,959
ideas around exploration where you're
 

747
00:11:34,959 --> 00:11:35,829
ideas around exploration where you're
trying to

748
00:11:35,829 --> 00:11:35,839
trying to
 

749
00:11:35,839 --> 00:11:38,949
trying to
take action that surprise a predictor

750
00:11:38,949 --> 00:11:38,959
take action that surprise a predictor
 

751
00:11:38,959 --> 00:11:40,630
take action that surprise a predictor
i'm a big fan of cos functions i think

752
00:11:40,630 --> 00:11:40,640
i'm a big fan of cos functions i think
 

753
00:11:40,640 --> 00:11:42,069
i'm a big fan of cos functions i think
cost functions are great and they serve

754
00:11:42,069 --> 00:11:42,079
cost functions are great and they serve
 

755
00:11:42,079 --> 00:11:43,509
cost functions are great and they serve
us really well and i think that whenever

756
00:11:43,509 --> 00:11:43,519
us really well and i think that whenever
 

757
00:11:43,519 --> 00:11:44,870
us really well and i think that whenever
we can do things because with cost

758
00:11:44,870 --> 00:11:44,880
we can do things because with cost
 

759
00:11:44,880 --> 00:11:47,110
we can do things because with cost
functions we should

760
00:11:47,110 --> 00:11:47,120
functions we should
 

761
00:11:47,120 --> 00:11:48,870
functions we should
and you know maybe there is a chance

762
00:11:48,870 --> 00:11:48,880
and you know maybe there is a chance
 

763
00:11:48,880 --> 00:11:50,230
and you know maybe there is a chance
that we will come up with some

764
00:11:50,230 --> 00:11:50,240
that we will come up with some
 

765
00:11:50,240 --> 00:11:52,310
that we will come up with some
yet another profound way of looking at

766
00:11:52,310 --> 00:11:52,320
yet another profound way of looking at
 

767
00:11:52,320 --> 00:11:54,069
yet another profound way of looking at
things that will involve cost functions

768
00:11:54,069 --> 00:11:54,079
things that will involve cost functions
 

769
00:11:54,079 --> 00:11:55,430
things that will involve cost functions
in a less central way

770
00:11:55,430 --> 00:11:55,440
in a less central way
 

771
00:11:55,440 --> 00:11:56,790
in a less central way
but i don't know i think cost functions

772
00:11:56,790 --> 00:11:56,800
but i don't know i think cost functions
 

773
00:11:56,800 --> 00:11:59,829
but i don't know i think cost functions
are i mean

774
00:11:59,829 --> 00:11:59,839

 

775
00:11:59,839 --> 00:12:01,590

i would not better guess against cost

776
00:12:01,590 --> 00:12:01,600
i would not better guess against cost
 

777
00:12:01,600 --> 00:12:02,949
i would not better guess against cost
functions

778
00:12:02,949 --> 00:12:02,959
functions
 

779
00:12:02,959 --> 00:12:05,350
functions
is there other things about the brain

780
00:12:05,350 --> 00:12:05,360
is there other things about the brain
 

781
00:12:05,360 --> 00:12:06,710
is there other things about the brain
that pop into your mind

782
00:12:06,710 --> 00:12:06,720
that pop into your mind
 

783
00:12:06,720 --> 00:12:09,269
that pop into your mind
that might be different and interesting

784
00:12:09,269 --> 00:12:09,279
that might be different and interesting
 

785
00:12:09,279 --> 00:12:10,949
that might be different and interesting
for us to consider

786
00:12:10,949 --> 00:12:10,959
for us to consider
 

787
00:12:10,959 --> 00:12:13,350
for us to consider
in designing artificial neural networks

788
00:12:13,350 --> 00:12:13,360
in designing artificial neural networks
 

789
00:12:13,360 --> 00:12:16,069
in designing artificial neural networks
so we talked about spiking a little bit

790
00:12:16,069 --> 00:12:16,079
so we talked about spiking a little bit
 

791
00:12:16,079 --> 00:12:17,430
so we talked about spiking a little bit
i mean one one thing which may

792
00:12:17,430 --> 00:12:17,440
i mean one one thing which may
 

793
00:12:17,440 --> 00:12:19,190
i mean one one thing which may
potentially be useful i think people

794
00:12:19,190 --> 00:12:19,200
potentially be useful i think people
 

795
00:12:19,200 --> 00:12:20,710
potentially be useful i think people
neuroscientists figured out something

796
00:12:20,710 --> 00:12:20,720
neuroscientists figured out something
 

797
00:12:20,720 --> 00:12:22,790
neuroscientists figured out something
about the learning rule of the brain or

798
00:12:22,790 --> 00:12:22,800
about the learning rule of the brain or
 

799
00:12:22,800 --> 00:12:24,150
about the learning rule of the brain or
i'm talking about spike time independent

800
00:12:24,150 --> 00:12:24,160
i'm talking about spike time independent
 

801
00:12:24,160 --> 00:12:25,990
i'm talking about spike time independent
elasticity and it would be nice if some

802
00:12:25,990 --> 00:12:26,000
elasticity and it would be nice if some
 

803
00:12:26,000 --> 00:12:28,230
elasticity and it would be nice if some
people were to study that in simulation

804
00:12:28,230 --> 00:12:28,240
people were to study that in simulation
 

805
00:12:28,240 --> 00:12:30,069
people were to study that in simulation
wait sorry spike time independent

806
00:12:30,069 --> 00:12:30,079
wait sorry spike time independent
 

807
00:12:30,079 --> 00:12:31,670
wait sorry spike time independent
plasticity yeah what's that

808
00:12:31,670 --> 00:12:31,680
plasticity yeah what's that
 

809
00:12:31,680 --> 00:12:34,470
plasticity yeah what's that
std it's a particular learning rule that

810
00:12:34,470 --> 00:12:34,480
std it's a particular learning rule that
 

811
00:12:34,480 --> 00:12:36,550
std it's a particular learning rule that
uses spike timing to figure out how to

812
00:12:36,550 --> 00:12:36,560
uses spike timing to figure out how to
 

813
00:12:36,560 --> 00:12:38,870
uses spike timing to figure out how to
to determine how to update the

814
00:12:38,870 --> 00:12:38,880
to determine how to update the
 

815
00:12:38,880 --> 00:12:40,949
to determine how to update the
synapses so it's kind of like if the

816
00:12:40,949 --> 00:12:40,959
synapses so it's kind of like if the
 

817
00:12:40,959 --> 00:12:42,949
synapses so it's kind of like if the
synapse fires into the neuron before the

818
00:12:42,949 --> 00:12:42,959
synapse fires into the neuron before the
 

819
00:12:42,959 --> 00:12:44,150
synapse fires into the neuron before the
neuron fires

820
00:12:44,150 --> 00:12:44,160
neuron fires
 

821
00:12:44,160 --> 00:12:46,069
neuron fires
then it strengthens the synapse and if

822
00:12:46,069 --> 00:12:46,079
then it strengthens the synapse and if
 

823
00:12:46,079 --> 00:12:47,910
then it strengthens the synapse and if
the synapse fires into the neurons

824
00:12:47,910 --> 00:12:47,920
the synapse fires into the neurons
 

825
00:12:47,920 --> 00:12:49,670
the synapse fires into the neurons
shortly after the neuron fire then it

952
00:14:49,110 --> 00:14:49,120
network and generally speaking i guess
 

953
00:14:49,120 --> 00:14:50,710

00:14:50,710 --> 00:14:50,720
what is a recurrent neural network
 

955
00:14:50,720 --> 00:14:51,750
what is a recurrent neural network
you have a neural network which

956
00:14:51,750 --> 00:14:51,760
you have a neural network which
 

957
00:14:51,760 --> 00:14:53,829
you have a neural network which
maintains a high dimensional hidden

958
00:14:53,829 --> 00:14:53,839
maintains a high dimensional hidden
 

959
00:14:53,839 --> 00:14:54,790
maintains a high dimensional hidden
state

960
00:14:54,790 --> 00:14:54,800
state
 

961
00:14:54,800 --> 00:14:57,030
state
and then when an observation arrives it

962
00:14:57,030 --> 00:14:57,040
and then when an observation arrives it
 

963
00:14:57,040 --> 00:14:58,949
and then when an observation arrives it
updates its high dimensional hidden

964
00:14:58,949 --> 00:14:58,959
updates its high dimensional hidden
 

965
00:14:58,959 --> 00:14:59,910
updates its high dimensional hidden
state through

966
00:14:59,910 --> 00:14:59,920
state through
 

967
00:14:59,920 --> 00:15:03,269
state through
its connections in some way

00:15:32,320 --> 00:15:34,310
gating units that we think of as today
with lstms and that

996
00:15:34,310 --> 00:15:34,320
with lstms and that
 

997
00:15:34,320 --> 00:15:36,069
with lstms and that
i mean the hidden state is technically

998
00:15:36,069 --> 00:15:36,079
i mean the hidden state is technically
 

999
00:15:36,079 --> 00:15:37,509
i mean the hidden state is technically
what you described there the hidden

1000
00:15:37,509 --> 00:15:37,519
what you described there the hidden
 

1001
00:15:37,519 --> 00:15:39,350
what you described there the hidden
state that goes inside the lstm or the

1002
00:15:39,350 --> 00:15:39,360
state that goes inside the lstm or the
 

1003
00:15:39,360 --> 00:15:41,189
state that goes inside the lstm or the
rnn or something like this

1004
00:15:41,189 --> 00:15:41,199
rnn or something like this
 

1005
00:15:41,199 --> 00:15:42,790
rnn or something like this
but then what should be contained you

1006
00:15:42,790 --> 00:15:42,800
but then what should be contained you
 

1007
00:15:42,800 --> 00:15:44,150
but then what should be contained you
know if you want to make the expert

1008
00:15:44,150 --> 00:15:44,160

um analogy i'm not i mean you could say

1012
00:15:48,310 --> 00:15:48,320
um analogy i'm not i mean you could say
 

1013
00:15:48,320 --> 00:15:48,949
um analogy i'm not i mean you could say
that

1014
00:15:48,949 --> 00:15:48,959
that
 

1015
00:15:48,959 --> 00:15:50,230
that
the knowledge is stored in the

1016
00:15:50,230 --> 00:15:50,240
the knowledge is stored in the
 

1017
00:15:50,240 --> 00:15:52,389
the knowledge is stored in the
connections and then the short term

1018
00:15:52,389 --> 00:15:52,399
connections and then the short term
 

1019
00:15:52,399 --> 00:15:54,150
connections and then the short term
processing is done in the

processing is done in the
 

1021
00:15:54,160 --> 00:15:57,189
processing is done in the
in the hidden state yes

1022
00:15:57,189 --> 00:15:57,199
in the hidden state yes
 

1023
00:15:57,199 --> 00:15:59,670
in the hidden state yes
could you say that yeah so sort of do

1024
00:15:59,670 --> 00:15:59,680
could you say that yeah so sort of do
 

1025
00:15:59,680 --> 00:16:01,590
could you say that yeah so sort of do
you think there's a future of building

1026
00:16:01,590 --> 00:16:01,600
you think there's a future of building
 

1027
00:16:01,600 --> 00:16:02,389
you think there's a future of building
large

1028
00:16:02,389 --> 00:16:02,399

definitely
 

1035
00:16:08,880 --> 00:16:10,389
definitely
so we're going to pause on that

1036
00:16:10,389 --> 00:16:10,399
so we're going to pause on that
 

1037
00:16:10,399 --> 00:16:11,990
so we're going to pause on that
confidence because i want to explore

that
 

1041
00:16:12,480 --> 00:16:16,870
that
well let me zoom back out and ask

1042
00:16:16,870 --> 00:16:16,880

 

1043
00:16:16,880 --> 00:16:19,430

decades as you mentioned
 

1049
00:16:22,720 --> 00:16:24,069

what do you think were the key ideas

1050
00:16:24,069 --> 00:16:24,079
what do you think were the key ideas
 

1051

okay so the question is to make sure i

1060
00:16:33,910 --> 00:16:33,920
okay so the question is to make sure i
 

1061
00:16:33,920 --> 00:16:36,310
okay so the question is to make sure i
didn't miss anything the key ideas that

the key idea about deep learning
 

1075
00:16:51,199 --> 00:16:53,430
the key idea about deep learning
or rather the key fact about deep

deep learning started to be successful
 

1081
00:16:58,079 --> 00:17:01,189
deep learning started to be successful
is that it was underestimated

1082
00:17:01,189 --> 00:17:01,199
is that it was underestimated
 

1083
00:17:01,199 --> 00:17:02,790
is that it was underestimated
people who worked in machine learning

1084
00:17:02,790 --> 00:17:02,800
people who worked in machine learning
 

1085
00:17:02,800 --> 00:17:04,789
people who worked in machine learning
simply didn't think that neural networks

1086
00:17:04,789 --> 00:17:04,799
simply didn't think that neural networks
 

1087
00:17:04,799 --> 00:17:06,150
simply didn't think that neural networks
could do much

1088
00:17:06,150 --> 00:17:06,160
could do much
 

1089
00:17:06,160 --> 00:17:08,309
could do much
people didn't believe that large neural

1090
00:17:08,309 --> 00:17:08,319
people didn't believe that large neural
 

1091
00:17:08,319 --> 00:17:10,390
people didn't believe that large neural
networks could be trained

1092
00:17:10,390 --> 00:17:10,400
networks could be trained
 

1093
00:17:10,400 --> 00:17:12,949
networks could be trained
people thought that well there was lots

1094
00:17:12,949 --> 00:17:12,959
people thought that well there was lots
 

1095
00:17:12,959 --> 00:17:14,870
people thought that well there was lots
of there was a lot of debate going on in

1096
00:17:14,870 --> 00:17:14,880
of there was a lot of debate going on in
 

1097
00:17:14,880 --> 00:17:16,069
of there was a lot of debate going on in
machine learning about what are the

1098
00:17:16,069 --> 00:17:16,079
machine learning about what are the
 

1099
00:17:16,079 --> 00:17:18,150
machine learning about what are the
right methods and so on and

1100
00:17:18,150 --> 00:17:18,160
right methods and so on and
 

1101
00:17:18,160 --> 00:17:19,829
right methods and so on and
people were arguing because there were

1102
00:17:19,829 --> 00:17:19,839
people were arguing because there were
 

1103
00:17:19,839 --> 00:17:21,590
people were arguing because there were
no there were there were no there was no

1104
00:17:21,590 --> 00:17:21,600
no there were there were no there was no
 

1105
00:17:21,600 --> 00:17:23,189
no there were there were no there was no
way to get hard facts

1106
00:17:23,189 --> 00:17:23,199
way to get hard facts
 

1107
00:17:23,199 --> 00:17:24,789
way to get hard facts
and by that i mean there were no

1108
00:17:24,789 --> 00:17:24,799
and by that i mean there were no
 

1109
00:17:24,799 --> 00:17:26,710
and by that i mean there were no
benchmarks which were truly hard

1110
00:17:26,710 --> 00:17:26,720
benchmarks which were truly hard
 

1111
00:17:26,720 --> 00:17:28,470
benchmarks which were truly hard
that if you do really well in them then

1112
00:17:28,470 --> 00:17:28,480
that if you do really well in them then
 

1113
00:17:28,480 --> 00:17:30,390
that if you do really well in them then
you can say look

1114
00:17:30,390 --> 00:17:30,400
you can say look
 

1115
00:17:30,400 --> 00:17:33,190
you can say look
here is my system that's when you switch

1116
00:17:33,190 --> 00:17:33,200
here is my system that's when you switch
 

1117
00:17:33,200 --> 00:17:35,350
here is my system that's when you switch
from

1118
00:17:35,350 --> 00:17:35,360
from
 

1119
00:17:35,360 --> 00:17:36,789
from
that's when this field becomes a little

1120
00:17:36,789 --> 00:17:36,799
that's when this field becomes a little
 

1121
00:17:36,799 --> 00:17:38,710
that's when this field becomes a little
bit more of an engineering field so in

1122
00:17:38,710 --> 00:17:38,720
bit more of an engineering field so in
 

1123
00:17:38,720 --> 00:17:40,070
bit more of an engineering field so in
terms of deep learning to answer the

1124
00:17:40,070 --> 00:17:40,080
terms of deep learning to answer the
 

1125
00:17:40,080 --> 00:17:40,470
terms of deep learning to answer the
question

1126
00:17:40,470 --> 00:17:40,480
question
 

1127
00:17:40,480 --> 00:17:43,510
question
directly the ideas were all there the

1128
00:17:43,510 --> 00:17:43,520
directly the ideas were all there the
 

1129
00:17:43,520 --> 00:17:45,190
directly the ideas were all there the
thing that was missing was

1130
00:17:45,190 --> 00:17:45,200
thing that was missing was
 

1131
00:17:45,200 --> 00:17:47,110
thing that was missing was
a lot of supervised data and a lot of

1132
00:17:47,110 --> 00:17:47,120
a lot of supervised data and a lot of
 

1133
00:17:47,120 --> 00:17:49,590
a lot of supervised data and a lot of
compute

1134
00:17:49,590 --> 00:17:49,600
compute
 

1135
00:17:49,600 --> 00:17:51,270
compute
once you have a lot of supervised data

1136
00:17:51,270 --> 00:17:51,280
once you have a lot of supervised data
 

1137
00:17:51,280 --> 00:17:52,950
once you have a lot of supervised data
and a lot of compute then there is a

1138
00:17:52,950 --> 00:17:52,960
and a lot of compute then there is a
 

1139
00:17:52,960 --> 00:17:54,630
and a lot of compute then there is a
third thing which is needed as well

1140
00:17:54,630 --> 00:17:54,640
third thing which is needed as well
 

1141
00:17:54,640 --> 00:17:57,110
third thing which is needed as well
and that is conviction conviction that

1142
00:17:57,110 --> 00:17:57,120
and that is conviction conviction that
 

1143
00:17:57,120 --> 00:17:58,310
and that is conviction conviction that
if you take

1144
00:17:58,310 --> 00:17:58,320
if you take
 

1145
00:17:58,320 --> 00:18:00,549
if you take
the right stuff which already exists and

1146
00:18:00,549 --> 00:18:00,559
the right stuff which already exists and
 

1147
00:18:00,559 --> 00:18:02,390
the right stuff which already exists and
apply and mix it with a lot of data and

1148
00:18:02,390 --> 00:18:02,400
apply and mix it with a lot of data and
 

1149
00:18:02,400 --> 00:18:03,350
apply and mix it with a lot of data and
a lot of compute

1150
00:18:03,350 --> 00:18:03,360
a lot of compute
 

1151
00:18:03,360 --> 00:18:06,470
a lot of compute
that it will in fact work and so that

1152
00:18:06,470 --> 00:18:06,480
that it will in fact work and so that
 

1153
00:18:06,480 --> 00:18:07,029
that it will in fact work and so that
was the

1154
00:18:07,029 --> 00:18:07,039
was the
 

1155
00:18:07,039 --> 00:18:08,710
was the
missing piece it was you had the you

1156
00:18:08,710 --> 00:18:08,720
missing piece it was you had the you
 

1157
00:18:08,720 --> 00:18:10,470
missing piece it was you had the you
need the data

1158
00:18:10,470 --> 00:18:10,480
need the data
 

1159
00:18:10,480 --> 00:18:12,549
need the data
you needed the compute which showed up

1160
00:18:12,549 --> 00:18:12,559
you needed the compute which showed up
 

1161
00:18:12,559 --> 00:18:13,990
you needed the compute which showed up
in terms of gpus

1162
00:18:13,990 --> 00:18:14,000
in terms of gpus
 

1163
00:18:14,000 --> 00:18:15,669
in terms of gpus
and you needed the conviction to realize

1164
00:18:15,669 --> 00:18:15,679
and you needed the conviction to realize
 

1165
00:18:15,679 --> 00:18:18,230
and you needed the conviction to realize
that you need to mix them together

1166
00:18:18,230 --> 00:18:18,240
that you need to mix them together
 

1167
00:18:18,240 --> 00:18:21,190
that you need to mix them together
so that's really interesting so uh i i

1168
00:18:21,190 --> 00:18:21,200
so that's really interesting so uh i i
 

1169
00:18:21,200 --> 00:18:21,909
so that's really interesting so uh i i
guess the

1170
00:18:21,909 --> 00:18:21,919
guess the
 

1171
00:18:21,919 --> 00:18:23,590
guess the
presence of compute and the present

1172
00:18:23,590 --> 00:18:23,600
presence of compute and the present
 

1173
00:18:23,600 --> 00:18:26,070
presence of compute and the present
supervised data

1174
00:18:26,070 --> 00:18:26,080
supervised data
 

1175
00:18:26,080 --> 00:18:28,870
supervised data
allowed the empirical evidence to do the

1176
00:18:28,870 --> 00:18:28,880
allowed the empirical evidence to do the
 

1177
00:18:28,880 --> 00:18:30,390
allowed the empirical evidence to do the
convincing of the majority of the

1178
00:18:30,390 --> 00:18:30,400
convincing of the majority of the
 

1179
00:18:30,400 --> 00:18:31,830
convincing of the majority of the
computer science community

1180
00:18:31,830 --> 00:18:31,840
computer science community
 

1181
00:18:31,840 --> 00:18:33,990
computer science community
so i guess there was a key moment with

1182
00:18:33,990 --> 00:18:34,000
so i guess there was a key moment with
 

1183
00:18:34,000 --> 00:18:35,190
so i guess there was a key moment with
uh

1184
00:18:35,190 --> 00:18:35,200
uh
 

1185
00:18:35,200 --> 00:18:38,630
uh
jitendra malik and uh alex

1186
00:18:38,630 --> 00:18:38,640
jitendra malik and uh alex
 

1187
00:18:38,640 --> 00:18:41,669
jitendra malik and uh alex
alyosha afros who were very skeptical

1188
00:18:41,669 --> 00:18:41,679
alyosha afros who were very skeptical
 

1189
00:18:41,679 --> 00:18:43,909
alyosha afros who were very skeptical
right and then there's a jeffrey hinton

1190
00:18:43,909 --> 00:18:43,919
right and then there's a jeffrey hinton
 

1191
00:18:43,919 --> 00:18:44,789
right and then there's a jeffrey hinton
that was

1192
00:18:44,789 --> 00:18:44,799
that was
 

1193
00:18:44,799 --> 00:18:46,950
that was
the opposite of skeptical and there was

1194
00:18:46,950 --> 00:18:46,960
the opposite of skeptical and there was
 

1195
00:18:46,960 --> 00:18:48,870
the opposite of skeptical and there was
a convincing moment and i think emission

1196
00:18:48,870 --> 00:18:48,880
a convincing moment and i think emission
 

1197
00:18:48,880 --> 00:18:50,150
a convincing moment and i think emission
had served as that moment

1198
00:18:50,150 --> 00:18:50,160
had served as that moment
 

1199
00:18:50,160 --> 00:18:51,909
had served as that moment
that's right and they represented this

1200
00:18:51,909 --> 00:18:51,919
that's right and they represented this
 

1201
00:18:51,919 --> 00:18:53,830
that's right and they represented this
kind of were the big

1202
00:18:53,830 --> 00:18:53,840
kind of were the big
 

1203
00:18:53,840 --> 00:18:55,830
kind of were the big
pillars of computer vision community

1204
00:18:55,830 --> 00:18:55,840
pillars of computer vision community
 

1205
00:18:55,840 --> 00:18:57,990
pillars of computer vision community
kind of the

1206
00:18:57,990 --> 00:18:58,000
kind of the
 

1207
00:18:58,000 --> 00:19:00,070
kind of the
the wizards got together and then all of

1208
00:19:00,070 --> 00:19:00,080
the wizards got together and then all of
 

1209
00:19:00,080 --> 00:19:01,430
the wizards got together and then all of
a sudden there was a shift

1210
00:19:01,430 --> 00:19:01,440
a sudden there was a shift
 

1211
00:19:01,440 --> 00:19:04,789
a sudden there was a shift
and it's not enough for the ideas to all

1212
00:19:04,789 --> 00:19:04,799
and it's not enough for the ideas to all
 

1213
00:19:04,799 --> 00:19:06,230
and it's not enough for the ideas to all
be there and the computer to be there

1214
00:19:06,230 --> 00:19:06,240
be there and the computer to be there
 

1215
00:19:06,240 --> 00:19:07,430
be there and the computer to be there
it's

1216
00:19:07,430 --> 00:19:07,440
it's
 

1217
00:19:07,440 --> 00:19:09,750
it's
for it to convince the cynicism that

1218
00:19:09,750 --> 00:19:09,760
for it to convince the cynicism that
 

1219
00:19:09,760 --> 00:19:11,190
for it to convince the cynicism that
existed that

1220
00:19:11,190 --> 00:19:11,200
existed that
 

1221
00:19:11,200 --> 00:19:12,950
existed that
it's interesting that people just didn't

1222
00:19:12,950 --> 00:19:12,960
it's interesting that people just didn't
 

1223
00:19:12,960 --> 00:19:15,830
it's interesting that people just didn't
believe for a couple of decades

1224
00:19:15,830 --> 00:19:15,840
believe for a couple of decades
 

1225
00:19:15,840 --> 00:19:18,630
believe for a couple of decades
yeah well but it's more than that it's

1226
00:19:18,630 --> 00:19:18,640
yeah well but it's more than that it's
 

1227
00:19:18,640 --> 00:19:19,909
yeah well but it's more than that it's
kind of

1228
00:19:19,909 --> 00:19:19,919
kind of
 

1229
00:19:19,919 --> 00:19:21,430
kind of
been put this way it sounds like well

1230
00:19:21,430 --> 00:19:21,440
been put this way it sounds like well
 

1231
00:19:21,440 --> 00:19:23,350
been put this way it sounds like well
you know those silly people who didn't

1232
00:19:23,350 --> 00:19:23,360
you know those silly people who didn't
 

1233
00:19:23,360 --> 00:19:24,150
you know those silly people who didn't
believe

1234
00:19:24,150 --> 00:19:24,160
believe
 

1235
00:19:24,160 --> 00:19:25,430

what were they what were they missing

1236
00:19:25,430 --> 00:19:25,440
what were they what were they missing
 

1237
00:19:25,440 --> 00:19:27,430
what were they what were they missing
but in reality things were confusing

1238
00:19:27,430 --> 00:19:27,440
but in reality things were confusing
 

1239
00:19:27,440 --> 00:19:28,950
but in reality things were confusing
because neural networks really did not

1240
00:19:28,950 --> 00:19:28,960
because neural networks really did not
 

1241
00:19:28,960 --> 00:19:30,070
because neural networks really did not
work on anything

1242
00:19:30,070 --> 00:19:30,080
work on anything
 

1243
00:19:30,080 --> 00:19:31,510
work on anything
and they were not the best method on

1244
00:19:31,510 --> 00:19:31,520
and they were not the best method on
 

1245
00:19:31,520 --> 00:19:33,510
and they were not the best method on
pretty much anything as well

1246
00:19:33,510 --> 00:19:33,520
pretty much anything as well
 

1247
00:19:33,520 --> 00:19:36,150
pretty much anything as well
and it was pretty rational to say yeah

1248
00:19:36,150 --> 00:19:36,160
and it was pretty rational to say yeah
 

1249
00:19:36,160 --> 00:19:39,510
and it was pretty rational to say yeah
this stuff doesn't have any traction

1250
00:19:39,510 --> 00:19:39,520
this stuff doesn't have any traction
 

1251
00:19:39,520 --> 00:19:41,110
this stuff doesn't have any traction
and that's why you need to have these

1252
00:19:41,110 --> 00:19:41,120
and that's why you need to have these
 

1253
00:19:41,120 --> 00:19:43,350
and that's why you need to have these
very hard tasks which are which produce

1254
00:19:43,350 --> 00:19:43,360
very hard tasks which are which produce
 

1255
00:19:43,360 --> 00:19:45,430
very hard tasks which are which produce
undeniable evidence and that's how we

1256
00:19:45,430 --> 00:19:45,440
undeniable evidence and that's how we
 

1257
00:19:45,440 --> 00:19:46,789
undeniable evidence and that's how we
make progress

1258
00:19:46,789 --> 00:19:46,799
make progress
 

1259
00:19:46,799 --> 00:19:47,909
make progress
and that's why the field is making

1260
00:19:47,909 --> 00:19:47,919
and that's why the field is making
 

1261
00:19:47,919 --> 00:19:49,270
and that's why the field is making
progress today because we have these

1262
00:19:49,270 --> 00:19:49,280
progress today because we have these
 

1263
00:19:49,280 --> 00:19:50,470
progress today because we have these
hard benchmarks

1264
00:19:50,470 --> 00:19:50,480
hard benchmarks
 

1265
00:19:50,480 --> 00:19:53,510
hard benchmarks
which represent true progress and so

1266
00:19:53,510 --> 00:19:53,520
which represent true progress and so
 

1267
00:19:53,520 --> 00:19:55,590
which represent true progress and so
and this is why we are able to avoid

1268
00:19:55,590 --> 00:19:55,600
and this is why we are able to avoid
 

1269
00:19:55,600 --> 00:19:58,230
and this is why we are able to avoid

00:23:14,880 --> 00:23:17,190
neither but it naturally interfaces and
integrates with the two of them

1486
00:23:17,190 --> 00:23:17,200
integrates with the two of them
 

1487
00:23:17,200 --> 00:23:18,710
integrates with the two of them
do you think action is fundamentally

1488
00:23:18,710 --> 00:23:18,720
do you think action is fundamentally
 

1489
00:23:18,720 --> 00:23:20,470
do you think action is fundamentally
different so yeah what is interesting

1490
00:23:20,470 --> 00:23:20,480
different so yeah what is interesting
 

1491
00:23:20,480 --> 00:23:21,190
different so yeah what is interesting
about

1492
00:23:21,190 --> 00:23:21,200
about
 

1493
00:23:21,200 --> 00:23:24,630
about
what is unique about policy of

1494
00:23:24,630 --> 00:23:24,640
what is unique about policy of
 

1495
00:23:24,640 --> 00:23:27,029
what is unique about policy of
learning to act well so one example for

1496
00:23:27,029 --> 00:23:27,039
learning to act well so one example for
 

1497
00:23:27,039 --> 00:23:28,710
learning to act well so one example for
instance is that

1498
00:23:28,710 --> 00:23:28,720
instance is that
 

1499
00:23:28,720 --> 00:23:30,230
instance is that
when you learn to act you are

1500
00:23:30,230 --> 00:23:30,240
when you learn to act you are
 

1501
00:23:30,240 --> 00:23:33,110
when you learn to act you are
fundamentally in a non-stationary world

1502
00:23:33,110 --> 00:23:33,120
fundamentally in a non-stationary world
 

1503
00:23:33,120 --> 00:23:35,830
fundamentally in a non-stationary world
because as your actions change the

1504
00:23:35,830 --> 00:23:35,840
because as your actions change the
 

1505
00:23:35,840 --> 00:23:36,549
because as your actions change the
things you see

1506
00:23:36,549 --> 00:23:36,559
things you see
 

1507
00:23:36,559 --> 00:23:40,230
things you see
start changing you you experience the

1508
00:23:40,230 --> 00:23:40,240
start changing you you experience the
 

1509
00:23:40,240 --> 00:23:41,990
start changing you you experience the
world in a different way and this is not

1510
00:23:41,990 --> 00:23:42,000
world in a different way and this is not
 

1511
00:23:42,000 --> 00:23:43,110
world in a different way and this is not
the case for

1512
00:23:43,110 --> 00:23:43,120
the case for
 

1513
00:23:43,120 --> 00:23:44,710
the case for
the more traditional static problem

1514
00:23:44,710 --> 00:23:44,720
the more traditional static problem
 

1515
00:23:44,720 --> 00:23:45,590
the more traditional static problem
where you have at least some

1516
00:23:45,590 --> 00:23:45,600
where you have at least some
 

1517
00:23:45,600 --> 00:23:47,029
where you have at least some
distribution and you just apply a model

1518
00:23:47,029 --> 00:23:47,039
distribution and you just apply a model
 

1519
00:23:47,039 --> 00:23:49,269
distribution and you just apply a model
to that distribution

1520
00:23:49,269 --> 00:23:49,279
to that distribution
 

1521
00:23:49,279 --> 00:23:50,390
to that distribution
do you think it's a fundamentally

1522
00:23:50,390 --> 00:23:50,400
do you think it's a fundamentally
 

1523
00:23:50,400 --> 00:23:52,390
do you think it's a fundamentally
different problem or is it just a more

1524
00:23:52,390 --> 00:23:52,400
different problem or is it just a more
 

1525
00:23:52,400 --> 00:23:53,350
different problem or is it just a more

1531
00:23:56,880 --> 00:23:58,549

i mean it's it's it's a question of

the case of reinforcement learning you

1546
00:24:07,990 --> 00:24:08,000
the case of reinforcement learning you
 

1547
00:24:08,000 --> 00:24:08,549
the case of reinforcement learning you
have

1548
00:24:08,549 --> 00:24:08,559
have
 

1549
00:24:08,559 --> 00:24:10,149
have
some tools to reduce the variance of the

1550
00:24:10,149 --> 00:24:10,159
some tools to reduce the variance of the
 

1551
00:24:10,159 --> 00:24:12,710
some tools to reduce the variance of the
gradients you do that

1552
00:24:12,710 --> 00:24:12,720
gradients you do that
 

1553
00:24:12,720 --> 00:24:14,230
gradients you do that
there's lots of commonality use the same

1554
00:24:14,230 --> 00:24:14,240
there's lots of commonality use the same
 

1555
00:24:14,240 --> 00:24:16,070
there's lots of commonality use the same
neural net in both cases

1556
00:24:16,070 --> 00:24:16,080
neural net in both cases
 

1557
00:24:16,080 --> 00:24:17,590
neural net in both cases
you compute the gradient you apply atom

1558
00:24:17,590 --> 00:24:17,600
you compute the gradient you apply atom
 

1559
00:24:17,600 --> 00:24:20,710
you compute the gradient you apply atom
in both cases

1561
00:24:20,720 --> 00:24:23,909

so i mean there's lots in common for

1562
00:24:23,909 --> 00:24:23,919
so i mean there's lots in common for
 

1563
00:24:23,919 --> 00:24:24,390
so i mean there's lots in common for
sure but

00:24:24,390 --> 00:24:24,400
sure but
 

1565
00:24:24,400 --> 00:24:26,950
sure but
there are some small differences which

00:24:26,950 --> 00:24:26,960
there are some small differences which
 

1567
00:24:26,960 --> 00:24:27,510
there are some small differences which

are not
 

1569
00:24:27,520 --> 00:24:29,110
are not
completely insignificant it's really

00:24:29,110 --> 00:24:29,120
completely insignificant it's really
 

1571
00:24:29,120 --> 00:24:31,350
completely insignificant it's really
just a matter of your point of view what

1572
00:24:31,350 --> 00:24:31,360
just a matter of your point of view what
 

1573
00:24:31,360 --> 00:24:33,190
just a matter of your point of view what
frame of reference you what how much do

1574
00:24:33,190 --> 00:24:33,200
frame of reference you what how much do

00:24:33,200 --> 00:24:34,870
frame of reference you what how much do
you want to zoom in or out

you want to zoom in or out
 

1577
00:24:34,880 --> 00:24:37,350
you want to zoom in or out
as you look at these problems which

1578
00:24:37,350 --> 00:24:37,360
as you look at these problems which
 

1579
00:24:37,360 --> 00:24:38,870
as you look at these problems which
problem do you think

1580
00:24:38,870 --> 00:24:38,880
problem do you think
 

1581
00:24:38,880 --> 00:24:41,190
problem do you think
is harder so people like no chomsky

1582
00:24:41,190 --> 00:24:41,200

believe that language is fundamental to

believe that language is fundamental to
 

1585
00:24:42,880 --> 00:24:43,830
believe that language is fundamental to
everything

everything
 

1587
00:24:43,840 --> 00:24:46,470
everything
so it underlies everything do you think

1588
00:24:46,470 --> 00:24:46,480
so it underlies everything do you think
 

1589
00:24:46,480 --> 00:24:47,029
so it underlies everything do you think

i think that asking if a problem is hard

1596
00:24:54,470 --> 00:24:54,480
i think that asking if a problem is hard
 

1597
00:24:54,480 --> 00:24:55,990
i think that asking if a problem is hard
is slightly wrong

1598
00:24:55,990 --> 00:24:56,000
is slightly wrong
 

1599
00:24:56,000 --> 00:24:57,110
is slightly wrong
i think the question is a little bit

1600
00:24:57,110 --> 00:24:57,120
i think the question is a little bit
 

1601
00:24:57,120 --> 00:24:59,430
i think the question is a little bit
wrong and i want to explain why

1602
00:24:59,430 --> 00:24:59,440
wrong and i want to explain why

00:24:59,440 --> 00:25:01,669
wrong and i want to explain why
so what does it mean for a problem to be

1604
00:25:01,669 --> 00:25:01,679
so what does it mean for a problem to be
 

1605
00:25:01,679 --> 00:25:04,230
so what does it mean for a problem to be
hard

1606
00:25:04,230 --> 00:25:04,240

 

1607
00:25:04,240 --> 00:25:06,870

okay the non-interesting dumb answer to

1608
00:25:06,870 --> 00:25:06,880
okay the non-interesting dumb answer to
 

1609
00:25:06,880 --> 00:25:07,430
okay the non-interesting dumb answer to
that is

1610
00:25:07,430 --> 00:25:07,440
that is
 

1611
00:25:07,440 --> 00:25:10,549
that is
there's this there's a benchmark

1612
00:25:10,549 --> 00:25:10,559
there's this there's a benchmark
 

1613
00:25:10,559 --> 00:25:12,230
there's this there's a benchmark
and there's a human level performance on

1614
00:25:12,230 --> 00:25:12,240
and there's a human level performance on
 

1615
00:25:12,240 --> 00:25:15,110
and there's a human level performance on
that benchmark and how

1616
00:25:15,110 --> 00:25:15,120
that benchmark and how
 

1617
00:25:15,120 --> 00:25:17,190
that benchmark and how
there's the effort required to reach the

1618
00:25:17,190 --> 00:25:17,200
there's the effort required to reach the
 

1619
00:25:17,200 --> 00:25:19,269
there's the effort required to reach the
human level okay benchmark so from the

1620
00:25:19,269 --> 00:25:19,279
human level okay benchmark so from the
 

1621
00:25:19,279 --> 00:25:21,350
human level okay benchmark so from the
perspective of how much until we

1622
00:25:21,350 --> 00:25:21,360
perspective of how much until we
 

1623
00:25:21,360 --> 00:25:24,310
perspective of how much until we
get to human level on a very good

1624
00:25:24,310 --> 00:25:24,320
get to human level on a very good
 

1625
00:25:24,320 --> 00:25:26,070
get to human level on a very good
benchmark

1626
00:25:26,070 --> 00:25:26,080
benchmark
 

1627
00:25:26,080 --> 00:25:28,070
benchmark
yeah like some i i understand what you

1628
00:25:28,070 --> 00:25:28,080
yeah like some i i understand what you
 

1629
00:25:28,080 --> 00:25:29,510
yeah like some i i understand what you
mean by that so what i was going i'm

1630
00:25:29,510 --> 00:25:29,520
mean by that so what i was going i'm
 

1631
00:25:29,520 --> 00:25:31,830
mean by that so what i was going i'm
going to say that a lot of it depends on

1632
00:25:31,830 --> 00:25:31,840
going to say that a lot of it depends on
 

1633
00:25:31,840 --> 00:25:33,110
going to say that a lot of it depends on
you know once you solve a problem it

1634
00:25:33,110 --> 00:25:33,120
you know once you solve a problem it
 

1635
00:25:33,120 --> 00:25:35,269
you know once you solve a problem it
stops being hard and that's all that's

1636
00:25:35,269 --> 00:25:35,279
stops being hard and that's all that's
 

1637
00:25:35,279 --> 00:25:36,470
stops being hard and that's all that's
always true and so

1638
00:25:36,470 --> 00:25:36,480
always true and so
 

1639
00:25:36,480 --> 00:25:38,149
always true and so
whether something is hard or not depends

1640
00:25:38,149 --> 00:25:38,159
whether something is hard or not depends
 

1641
00:25:38,159 --> 00:25:39,909
whether something is hard or not depends
on what our tools can do today so you

1642
00:25:39,909 --> 00:25:39,919
on what our tools can do today so you
 

1643
00:25:39,919 --> 00:25:41,669
on what our tools can do today so you
know you say today

1644
00:25:41,669 --> 00:25:41,679
know you say today
 

1645
00:25:41,679 --> 00:25:44,710
know you say today
true human level language understanding

1646
00:25:44,710 --> 00:25:44,720
true human level language understanding
 

1647
00:25:44,720 --> 00:25:46,390
true human level language understanding
and visual perception are hard in the

1648
00:25:46,390 --> 00:25:46,400
and visual perception are hard in the
 

1649
00:25:46,400 --> 00:25:48,549
and visual perception are hard in the
sense that there is no

1650
00:25:48,549 --> 00:25:48,559
sense that there is no
 

1651
00:25:48,559 --> 00:25:50,390
sense that there is no
way of solving the problem completely in

1652
00:25:50,390 --> 00:25:50,400
way of solving the problem completely in
 

1653
00:25:50,400 --> 00:25:51,830
way of solving the problem completely in
the next three months right

1654
00:25:51,830 --> 00:25:51,840
the next three months right
 

1655
00:25:51,840 --> 00:25:54,149
the next three months right
so i agree with that statement beyond

1656
00:25:54,149 --> 00:25:54,159
so i agree with that statement beyond
 

1657
00:25:54,159 --> 00:25:55,830
so i agree with that statement beyond
that i'm just i'll be my my guess would

1658
00:25:55,830 --> 00:25:55,840
that i'm just i'll be my my guess would
 

1659
00:25:55,840 --> 00:25:57,269
that i'm just i'll be my my guess would
be as good as yours i don't know

1660
00:25:57,269 --> 00:25:57,279
be as good as yours i don't know
 

1661
00:25:57,279 --> 00:25:59,669
be as good as yours i don't know
oh okay so you don't have a fundamental

1662
00:25:59,669 --> 00:25:59,679
oh okay so you don't have a fundamental
 

1663
00:25:59,679 --> 00:26:01,190
oh okay so you don't have a fundamental
intuition about

1664
00:26:01,190 --> 00:26:01,200
intuition about
 

1665
00:26:01,200 --> 00:26:02,789
intuition about
how hard language understanding is i

1666
00:26:02,789 --> 00:26:02,799
how hard language understanding is i
 

1667
00:26:02,799 --> 00:26:04,310
how hard language understanding is i
think i i know i changed my mind let's

1668
00:26:04,310 --> 00:26:04,320
think i i know i changed my mind let's
 

1669
00:26:04,320 --> 00:26:06,230
think i i know i changed my mind let's
say language is probably going to be

1670
00:26:06,230 --> 00:26:06,240
say language is probably going to be
 

1671
00:26:06,240 --> 00:26:07,830
say language is probably going to be
harder i mean it depends on how you

1672
00:26:07,830 --> 00:26:07,840
harder i mean it depends on how you
 

1673
00:26:07,840 --> 00:26:09,830
harder i mean it depends on how you
define it like if you mean

1674
00:26:09,830 --> 00:26:09,840
define it like if you mean
 

1675
00:26:09,840 --> 00:26:12,390
define it like if you mean
absolute top-notch 100 language

1676
00:26:12,390 --> 00:26:12,400
absolute top-notch 100 language
 

1677
00:26:12,400 --> 00:26:15,190
absolute top-notch 100 language
understanding i'll go with language

1678
00:26:15,190 --> 00:26:15,200
understanding i'll go with language
 

1679
00:26:15,200 --> 00:26:17,269
understanding i'll go with language
so but then if i show you a piece of

1680
00:26:17,269 --> 00:26:17,279
so but then if i show you a piece of
 

1681
00:26:17,279 --> 00:26:18,870
so but then if i show you a piece of
paper with letters on it

1682
00:26:18,870 --> 00:26:18,880
paper with letters on it
 

1683
00:26:18,880 --> 00:26:21,750
paper with letters on it
is that you see what i mean it's uh you

1684
00:26:21,750 --> 00:26:21,760
is that you see what i mean it's uh you
 

1685
00:26:21,760 --> 00:26:23,029
is that you see what i mean it's uh you
have a vision system you say it's the

1686
00:26:23,029 --> 00:26:23,039
have a vision system you say it's the
 

1687
00:26:23,039 --> 00:26:23,590
have a vision system you say it's the
best

1688
00:26:23,590 --> 00:26:23,600
best
 

1689
00:26:23,600 --> 00:26:25,750
best
human level vision system i show you i

1690
00:26:25,750 --> 00:26:25,760
human level vision system i show you i
 

1691
00:26:25,760 --> 00:26:26,870
human level vision system i show you i
open a book

1692
00:26:26,870 --> 00:26:26,880
open a book
 

1693
00:26:26,880 --> 00:26:29,029
open a book
and i show you letters will it

1694
00:26:29,029 --> 00:26:29,039
and i show you letters will it
 

1695
00:26:29,039 --> 00:26:30,470
and i show you letters will it
understand how these letters form into

1696
00:26:30,470 --> 00:26:30,480
understand how these letters form into
 

1697
00:26:30,480 --> 00:26:32,149
understand how these letters form into
words and sentences and meaning

1698
00:26:32,149 --> 00:26:32,159
words and sentences and meaning
 

1699
00:26:32,159 --> 00:26:33,750
words and sentences and meaning
is this part of the vision problem where

1700
00:26:33,750 --> 00:26:33,760
is this part of the vision problem where
 

1701
00:26:33,760 --> 00:26:36,070
is this part of the vision problem where
does vision end and language begin

1702
00:26:36,070 --> 00:26:36,080
does vision end and language begin
 

1703
00:26:36,080 --> 00:26:37,669
does vision end and language begin
yeah so chomsky would say it starts at

1704
00:26:37,669 --> 00:26:37,679
yeah so chomsky would say it starts at
 

1705
00:26:37,679 --> 00:26:39,269
yeah so chomsky would say it starts at
language so vision is just a little

1706
00:26:39,269 --> 00:26:39,279
language so vision is just a little
 

1707
00:26:39,279 --> 00:26:41,430
language so vision is just a little
example of the kind of

1708
00:26:41,430 --> 00:26:41,440
example of the kind of
 

1709
00:26:41,440 --> 00:26:45,350
example of the kind of
uh structure and you know fundamental

1710
00:26:45,350 --> 00:26:45,360
uh structure and you know fundamental
 

1711
00:26:45,360 --> 00:26:46,870
uh structure and you know fundamental
hierarchy of ideas that's already

1712
00:26:46,870 --> 00:26:46,880
hierarchy of ideas that's already
 

1713
00:26:46,880 --> 00:26:49,110
hierarchy of ideas that's already
represented in our brain somehow

1714
00:26:49,110 --> 00:26:49,120
represented in our brain somehow
 

1715
00:26:49,120 --> 00:26:52,870
represented in our brain somehow
that's represented through language but

1716
00:26:52,870 --> 00:26:52,880
that's represented through language but
 

1717
00:26:52,880 --> 00:26:55,750
that's represented through language but
where does vision stop and language

1718
00:26:55,750 --> 00:26:55,760
where does vision stop and language
 

1719
00:26:55,760 --> 00:26:57,830
where does vision stop and language
begin

1720
00:26:57,830 --> 00:26:57,840
begin
 

1721
00:26:57,840 --> 00:27:04,830
begin
that's a really interesting

1722
00:27:04,830 --> 00:27:04,840

 

1723
00:27:04,840 --> 00:27:07,269

question

1724
00:27:07,269 --> 00:27:07,279
question
 

1725
00:27:07,279 --> 00:27:09,269
question
it so one possibility is that it's

1726
00:27:09,269 --> 00:27:09,279
it so one possibility is that it's
 

1727
00:27:09,279 --> 00:27:10,390
it so one possibility is that it's
impossible to achieve

1728
00:27:10,390 --> 00:27:10,400
impossible to achieve
 

1729
00:27:10,400 --> 00:27:13,110
impossible to achieve
really deep understanding in either

1730
00:27:13,110 --> 00:27:13,120
really deep understanding in either
 

1731
00:27:13,120 --> 00:27:14,630
really deep understanding in either
images

1732
00:27:14,630 --> 00:27:14,640
images
 

1733
00:27:14,640 --> 00:27:16,630
images
or language without basically using the

1734
00:27:16,630 --> 00:27:16,640
or language without basically using the
 

1735
00:27:16,640 --> 00:27:18,230
or language without basically using the
same kind of system

1736
00:27:18,230 --> 00:27:18,240
same kind of system
 

1737
00:27:18,240 --> 00:27:20,070
same kind of system
so you're going to get the other for

1738
00:27:20,070 --> 00:27:20,080
so you're going to get the other for
 

1739
00:27:20,080 --> 00:27:21,350
so you're going to get the other for
free

1740
00:27:21,350 --> 00:27:21,360
free
 

1741
00:27:21,360 --> 00:27:22,710
free
i think i think it's pretty likely that

1742
00:27:22,710 --> 00:27:22,720
i think i think it's pretty likely that
 

1743
00:27:22,720 --> 00:27:24,710
i think i think it's pretty likely that
yes if we can get one we prob our

1744
00:27:24,710 --> 00:27:24,720
yes if we can get one we prob our
 

1745
00:27:24,720 --> 00:27:26,230
yes if we can get one we prob our
machine learning is probably that good

1746
00:27:26,230 --> 00:27:26,240
machine learning is probably that good
 

1747
00:27:26,240 --> 00:27:28,070
machine learning is probably that good
that we can get the other but it's not

1748
00:27:28,070 --> 00:27:28,080
that we can get the other but it's not
 

1749
00:27:28,080 --> 00:27:31,430
that we can get the other but it's not
100 i'm not 100 sure and also

1750
00:27:31,430 --> 00:27:31,440
100 i'm not 100 sure and also
 

1751
00:27:31,440 --> 00:27:34,149
100 i'm not 100 sure and also
i think a lot a lot of it really does

1752
00:27:34,149 --> 00:27:34,159
i think a lot a lot of it really does
 

1753
00:27:34,159 --> 00:27:36,630
i think a lot a lot of it really does
depend on your definitions

1754
00:27:36,630 --> 00:27:36,640
depend on your definitions
 

1755
00:27:36,640 --> 00:27:39,830
depend on your definitions
definitions of like perfect vision

1756
00:27:39,830 --> 00:27:39,840
definitions of like perfect vision
 

1757
00:27:39,840 --> 00:27:41,350
definitions of like perfect vision
because really you know reading is

1758
00:27:41,350 --> 00:27:41,360
because really you know reading is
 

1759
00:27:41,360 --> 00:27:44,549
because really you know reading is
vision but should it count

1760
00:27:44,549 --> 00:27:44,559
vision but should it count
 

1761
00:27:44,559 --> 00:27:46,710
vision but should it count
yeah to me so my definition is if a

1762
00:27:46,710 --> 00:27:46,720
yeah to me so my definition is if a
 

1763
00:27:46,720 --> 00:27:48,710
yeah to me so my definition is if a
system looked at an image

1764
00:27:48,710 --> 00:27:48,720
system looked at an image
 

1765
00:27:48,720 --> 00:27:51,269
system looked at an image
and then the system looked at a piece of

1766
00:27:51,269 --> 00:27:51,279
and then the system looked at a piece of
 

1767
00:27:51,279 --> 00:27:52,149
and then the system looked at a piece of
text

1768
00:27:52,149 --> 00:27:52,159
text
 

1769
00:27:52,159 --> 00:27:55,909
text
and then told me something about that

1770
00:27:55,909 --> 00:27:55,919
and then told me something about that
 

1771
00:27:55,919 --> 00:27:58,549
and then told me something about that
and i was really impressed that's

1772
00:27:58,549 --> 00:27:58,559
and i was really impressed that's
 

1773
00:27:58,559 --> 00:27:59,350
and i was really impressed that's
relative

1774
00:27:59,350 --> 00:27:59,360
relative
 

1775
00:27:59,360 --> 00:28:01,190
relative
you'll be impressed for half an hour and

1776
00:28:01,190 --> 00:28:01,200
you'll be impressed for half an hour and
 

1777
00:28:01,200 --> 00:28:02,470
you'll be impressed for half an hour and
then you're gonna say well i mean all

1778
00:28:02,470 --> 00:28:02,480
then you're gonna say well i mean all
 

1779
00:28:02,480 --> 00:28:03,990
then you're gonna say well i mean all
the systems do that but here's the thing

1780
00:28:03,990 --> 00:28:04,000
the systems do that but here's the thing
 

1781
00:28:04,000 --> 00:28:05,029
the systems do that but here's the thing
they don't do

1782
00:28:05,029 --> 00:28:05,039
they don't do
 

1783
00:28:05,039 --> 00:28:06,950
they don't do
yeah but i don't have that with humans

1784
00:28:06,950 --> 00:28:06,960
yeah but i don't have that with humans
 

1785
00:28:06,960 --> 00:28:08,789
yeah but i don't have that with humans
humans continue to impress me

1786
00:28:08,789 --> 00:28:08,799
humans continue to impress me
 

1787
00:28:08,799 --> 00:28:12,549
humans continue to impress me
is that true well the ones okay so

1788
00:28:12,549 --> 00:28:12,559
is that true well the ones okay so
 

1789
00:28:12,559 --> 00:28:14,950
is that true well the ones okay so
i'm a fan of monogamy so i like the idea

1790
00:28:14,950 --> 00:28:14,960
i'm a fan of monogamy so i like the idea
 

1791
00:28:14,960 --> 00:28:16,630
i'm a fan of monogamy so i like the idea
of marrying somebody being with them for

1792
00:28:16,630 --> 00:28:16,640
of marrying somebody being with them for
 

1793
00:28:16,640 --> 00:28:17,990
of marrying somebody being with them for
several decades

1794
00:28:17,990 --> 00:28:18,000
several decades
 

1795
00:28:18,000 --> 00:28:20,070
several decades
so i i believe in the fact that yes it's

1796
00:28:20,070 --> 00:28:20,080
so i i believe in the fact that yes it's
 

1797
00:28:20,080 --> 00:28:21,430
so i i believe in the fact that yes it's
possible to have somebody

1798
00:28:21,430 --> 00:28:21,440
possible to have somebody
 

1799
00:28:21,440 --> 00:28:25,750
possible to have somebody
continuously giving you uh pleasurable

00:28:25,750 --> 00:28:25,760
continuously giving you uh pleasurable
 

1801
00:28:25,760 --> 00:28:28,950
continuously giving you uh pleasurable
interesting witty new ideas friends yeah

1802
00:28:28,950 --> 00:28:28,960
interesting witty new ideas friends yeah
 

1803
00:28:28,960 --> 00:28:30,549
interesting witty new ideas friends yeah
i think i think so they continue to

1804
00:28:30,549 --> 00:28:30,559
i think i think so they continue to
 

1805
00:28:30,559 --> 00:28:33,269
i think i think so they continue to
surprise you the surprise

1806
00:28:33,269 --> 00:28:33,279
surprise you the surprise
 

1807
00:28:33,279 --> 00:28:36,230
surprise you the surprise
it's um you know that injection of

00:28:36,230 --> 00:28:36,240
it's um you know that injection of
 

1809
00:28:36,240 --> 00:28:37,909
it's um you know that injection of
randomness

1810
00:28:37,909 --> 00:28:37,919
randomness
 

1811
00:28:37,919 --> 00:28:41,269
randomness
seems to be uh it seems to be a nice

1812
00:28:41,269 --> 00:28:41,279
seems to be uh it seems to be a nice
 

1813
00:28:41,279 --> 00:28:45,909

1814
00:28:45,909 --> 00:28:45,919
source of yeah continued
 

1815
00:28:45,919 --> 00:28:48,149

uh inspiration like the the wit the

1816
00:28:48,149 --> 00:28:48,159
uh inspiration like the the wit the
 

1817
00:28:48,159 --> 00:28:49,269
uh inspiration like the the wit the
humor i think

1818
00:28:49,269 --> 00:28:49,279
humor i think
 

1819
00:28:49,279 --> 00:28:53,110
humor i think
yeah that that the that would be

1820
00:28:53,110 --> 00:28:53,120
yeah that that the that would be
 

1821
00:28:53,120 --> 00:28:55,029
yeah that that the that would be
a it's a very subjective test but i

1822
00:28:55,029 --> 00:28:55,039
a it's a very subjective test but i
 

1823
00:28:55,039 --> 00:28:57,110
a it's a very subjective test but i
think if you have enough humans

1824
00:28:57,110 --> 00:28:57,120
think if you have enough humans
 

1825
00:28:57,120 --> 00:28:59,990
think if you have enough humans
in the room yeah i i understand what you

1826
00:28:59,990 --> 00:29:00,000
in the room yeah i i understand what you
 

1827
00:29:00,000 --> 00:29:00,389
in the room yeah i i understand what you
mean

1828
00:29:00,389 --> 00:29:00,399
mean
 

1829
00:29:00,399 --> 00:29:02,149
mean
yeah i feel like i i misunderstood what

1830
00:29:02,149 --> 00:29:02,159
yeah i feel like i i misunderstood what
 

1831
00:29:02,159 --> 00:29:03,269
yeah i feel like i i misunderstood what
you meant by impressing you i thought

1832
00:29:03,269 --> 00:29:03,279
you meant by impressing you i thought
 

1833
00:29:03,279 --> 00:29:05,269
you meant by impressing you i thought
you meant to impress you with its

1834
00:29:05,269 --> 00:29:05,279
you meant to impress you with its
 

1835
00:29:05,279 --> 00:29:08,149
you meant to impress you with its
intelligence with how how with how good

1836
00:29:08,149 --> 00:29:08,159
intelligence with how how with how good
 

1837

well it understands um an image

1838
00:29:10,230 --> 00:29:10,240
well it understands um an image
 

1839
00:29:10,240 --> 00:29:11,669
well it understands um an image
i thought you meant something like i'm

1840
00:29:11,669 --> 00:29:11,679
i thought you meant something like i'm
 

1841
00:29:11,679 --> 00:29:12,950
i thought you meant something like i'm
going to show it a really complicated

1842
00:29:12,950 --> 00:29:12,960
going to show it a really complicated
 

1843
00:29:12,960 --> 00:29:13,990
going to show it a really complicated
image and it's going to get it right and

1844
00:29:13,990 --> 00:29:14,000
image and it's going to get it right and
 

1845
00:29:14,000 --> 00:29:14,950
image and it's going to get it right and
you're going to say wow

1846
00:29:14,950 --> 00:29:14,960
you're going to say wow
 

1847
00:29:14,960 --> 00:29:17,830
you're going to say wow
that's really cool systems of you know

1848
00:29:17,830 --> 00:29:17,840
that's really cool systems of you know
 

1849
00:29:17,840 --> 00:29:19,909
that's really cool systems of you know
january 2020 have not been doing that

1850
00:29:19,909 --> 00:29:19,919
january 2020 have not been doing that
 

1851
00:29:19,919 --> 00:29:22,149
january 2020 have not been doing that
yeah no i i think it all boils down to

1852
00:29:22,149 --> 00:29:22,159
yeah no i i think it all boils down to
 

1853
00:29:22,159 --> 00:29:23,430
yeah no i i think it all boils down to
like

1854
00:29:23,430 --> 00:29:23,440
like
 

1855
00:29:23,440 --> 00:29:25,430
like
the reason people click like on stuff on

1856
00:29:25,430 --> 00:29:25,440
the reason people click like on stuff on
 

1857
00:29:25,440 --> 00:29:27,430
the reason people click like on stuff on
the internet which is like it makes them

1858
00:29:27,430 --> 00:29:27,440
the internet which is like it makes them
 

1859
00:29:27,440 --> 00:29:30,789
the internet which is like it makes them
laugh so it's like humor or wit

1860
00:29:30,789 --> 00:29:30,799
laugh so it's like humor or wit
 

1861
00:29:30,799 --> 00:29:33,909
laugh so it's like humor or wit
yeah or insight i'm sure we'll get it as

1862
00:29:33,909 --> 00:29:33,919
yeah or insight i'm sure we'll get it as
 

1863
00:29:33,919 --> 00:29:35,350
yeah or insight i'm sure we'll get it as
get that as well

1864
00:29:35,350 --> 00:29:35,360
get that as well
 

1865
00:29:35,360 --> 00:29:39,110
get that as well
so forgive the romanticized question but

1866
00:29:39,110 --> 00:29:39,120
so forgive the romanticized question but
 

1867
00:29:39,120 --> 00:29:41,350
so forgive the romanticized question but
looking back to you what is the most

1868
00:29:41,350 --> 00:29:41,360
looking back to you what is the most
 

1869
00:29:41,360 --> 00:29:43,269
looking back to you what is the most
beautiful or surprising idea in deep

1870
00:29:43,269 --> 00:29:43,279
beautiful or surprising idea in deep
 

1871
00:29:43,279 --> 00:29:44,070
beautiful or surprising idea in deep
learning

1872
00:29:44,070 --> 00:29:44,080
learning
 

1873
00:29:44,080 --> 00:29:46,950
learning
or ai in general you've come across so i

1874
00:29:46,950 --> 00:29:46,960
or ai in general you've come across so i
 

1875
00:29:46,960 --> 00:29:48,549
or ai in general you've come across so i
think the most beautiful thing about

1876
00:29:48,549 --> 00:29:48,559
think the most beautiful thing about
 

1877
00:29:48,559 --> 00:29:51,510
think the most beautiful thing about
deep learning is that it actually works

1878
00:29:51,510 --> 00:29:51,520
deep learning is that it actually works
 

1879
00:29:51,520 --> 00:29:52,710
deep learning is that it actually works
and i mean it because you got these

1880
00:29:52,710 --> 00:29:52,720
and i mean it because you got these
 

1881
00:29:52,720 --> 00:29:54,549
and i mean it because you got these
ideas you got the little neural network

1882
00:29:54,549 --> 00:29:54,559
ideas you got the little neural network
 

1883
00:29:54,559 --> 00:29:58,789
ideas you got the little neural network
you got the back propagation algorithm

1884
00:29:58,789 --> 00:29:58,799

 

1885
00:29:58,799 --> 00:30:00,389

and then you got some theories as to you

1886
00:30:00,389 --> 00:30:00,399
and then you got some theories as to you
 

1887
00:30:00,399 --> 00:30:02,070
and then you got some theories as to you
know this is kind of like the brain so

1888
00:30:02,070 --> 00:30:02,080
know this is kind of like the brain so
 

1889
00:30:02,080 --> 00:30:03,430
know this is kind of like the brain so
maybe if you make it large

1890
00:30:03,430 --> 00:30:03,440
maybe if you make it large
 

1891
00:30:03,440 --> 00:30:04,789
maybe if you make it large
if you make the neural network lodge and

1892
00:30:04,789 --> 00:30:04,799
if you make the neural network lodge and
 

1893
00:30:04,799 --> 00:30:07,830
if you make the neural network lodge and
you train it a lot of data then it will

1894
00:30:07,830 --> 00:30:07,840
you train it a lot of data then it will
 

1895
00:30:07,840 --> 00:30:09,510
you train it a lot of data then it will
do the same function of the brain does

1896
00:30:09,510 --> 00:30:09,520
do the same function of the brain does
 

1897
00:30:09,520 --> 00:30:12,389
do the same function of the brain does
and it turns out to be true that's crazy

1898
00:30:12,389 --> 00:30:12,399
and it turns out to be true that's crazy
 

1899
00:30:12,399 --> 00:30:13,750
and it turns out to be true that's crazy
and now we just train these neural

1900
00:30:13,750 --> 00:30:13,760
and now we just train these neural
 

1901
00:30:13,760 --> 00:30:14,950
and now we just train these neural
networks and you make them larger and

1902
00:30:14,950 --> 00:30:14,960
networks and you make them larger and
 

1903
00:30:14,960 --> 00:30:16,549
networks and you make them larger and
they keep getting better

1904
00:30:16,549 --> 00:30:16,559
they keep getting better
 

1905
00:30:16,559 --> 00:30:18,230
they keep getting better
and i find it unbelievable i find it

1906
00:30:18,230 --> 00:30:18,240
and i find it unbelievable i find it
 

1907
00:30:18,240 --> 00:30:20,470
and i find it unbelievable i find it
unbelievable that this whole ai stuff

1908
00:30:20,470 --> 00:30:20,480
unbelievable that this whole ai stuff

00:31:20,789 --> 00:31:20,799
some new physics theory and make some
 

1969
00:31:20,799 --> 00:31:21,590
some new physics theory and make some
prediction

1970
00:31:21,590 --> 00:31:21,600
prediction
 

1971
00:31:21,600 --> 00:31:23,830
prediction
but then you gotta run the experiment

1972
00:31:23,830 --> 00:31:23,840
but then you gotta run the experiment
 

1973
00:31:23,840 --> 00:31:25,029
but then you gotta run the experiment
you know you gotta run the experiment

1974
00:31:25,029 --> 00:31:25,039
you know you gotta run the experiment
 

1975
00:31:25,039 --> 00:31:25,909
you know you gotta run the experiment
it's important

1976
00:31:25,909 --> 00:31:25,919
it's important
 

1977
00:31:25,919 --> 00:31:27,750
it's important
so it's a bit the same here except that

1978
00:31:27,750 --> 00:31:27,760
so it's a bit the same here except that
 

1979
00:31:27,760 --> 00:31:29,110
so it's a bit the same here except that
maybe some sometimes

1980
00:31:29,110 --> 00:31:29,120
maybe some sometimes
 

1981
00:31:29,120 --> 00:31:30,950
maybe some sometimes
the experiment came before the theory

1982
00:31:30,950 --> 00:31:30,960
the experiment came before the theory
 

1983
00:31:30,960 --> 00:31:32,389
the experiment came before the theory
but it still is the case you know you

1984
00:31:32,389 --> 00:31:32,399
but it still is the case you know you
 

1985
00:31:32,399 --> 00:31:33,430
but it still is the case you know you
have some

1986
00:31:33,430 --> 00:31:33,440
have some
 

1987
00:31:33,440 --> 00:31:34,470
have some
data and you come up with some

1988
00:31:34,470 --> 00:31:34,480
data and you come up with some
 

1989
00:31:34,480 --> 00:31:35,909
data and you come up with some
prediction you say yeah let's make a big

1990
00:31:35,909 --> 00:31:35,919
prediction you say yeah let's make a big
 

1991
00:31:35,919 --> 00:31:37,269
prediction you say yeah let's make a big
neural network let's train it and it's

1992
00:31:37,269 --> 00:31:37,279
neural network let's train it and it's
 

1993
00:31:37,279 --> 00:31:38,470
neural network let's train it and it's
going to work

1994
00:31:38,470 --> 00:31:38,480
going to work
 

1995
00:31:38,480 --> 00:31:39,830
going to work
much better than anything before it and

1996
00:31:39,830 --> 00:31:39,840
much better than anything before it and
 

1997
00:31:39,840 --> 00:31:41,350
much better than anything before it and
it will in fact continue to get better

1998
00:31:41,350 --> 00:31:41,360
it will in fact continue to get better
 

1999
00:31:41,360 --> 00:31:42,549
it will in fact continue to get better
as you make it larger

2000
00:31:42,549 --> 00:31:42,559
as you make it larger
 

2001
00:31:42,559 --> 00:31:44,149
as you make it larger
and it turns out to be true that's

2002
00:31:44,149 --> 00:31:44,159
and it turns out to be true that's
 

2003
00:31:44,159 --> 00:31:45,990
and it turns out to be true that's
that's amazing when a theory is

2004
00:31:45,990 --> 00:31:46,000
that's amazing when a theory is
 

2005
00:31:46,000 --> 00:31:47,269
that's amazing when a theory is
validated like this you know

2006
00:31:47,269 --> 00:31:47,279
validated like this you know
 

2007
00:31:47,279 --> 00:31:48,950
validated like this you know
it's not a mathematical theory it's more

2008
00:31:48,950 --> 00:31:48,960
it's not a mathematical theory it's more
 

2009
00:31:48,960 --> 00:31:51,590
it's not a mathematical theory it's more
of a biological theory almost

2010
00:31:51,590 --> 00:31:51,600
of a biological theory almost
 

2011
00:31:51,600 --> 00:31:53,350
of a biological theory almost
so i think there are not terrible

2012
00:31:53,350 --> 00:31:53,360
so i think there are not terrible
 

2013
00:31:53,360 --> 00:31:54,630
so i think there are not terrible
analogies between deep learning and

i would say it's like the geometric mean

2018
00:31:57,430 --> 00:31:57,440
i would say it's like the geometric mean
 

2019
00:31:57,440 --> 00:31:59,029
i would say it's like the geometric mean

it's really hard to have good predictive

2044
00:32:22,389 --> 00:32:22,399
it's really hard to have good predictive
 

2045
00:32:22,399 --> 00:32:24,070
it's really hard to have good predictive
theory and if in physics the theories

2047
00:32:24,080 --> 00:32:25,350

are too good
 

2049
00:32:25,360 --> 00:32:26,710

in theory in physics people make these

2050
00:32:26,710 --> 00:32:26,720
in theory in physics people make these
 

2051
00:32:26,720 --> 00:32:28,230
in theory in physics people make these
super precise theories which make these

amazing predictions

2054
00:32:29,110 --> 00:32:29,120
amazing predictions
 

2055
00:32:29,120 --> 00:32:30,310
amazing predictions
and in machine learning mechanics in

2056
00:32:30,310 --> 00:32:30,320
and in machine learning mechanics in
 

2057
00:32:30,320 --> 00:32:33,029
and in machine learning mechanics in
between kind of in between but

2058
00:32:33,029 --> 00:32:33,039
between kind of in between but
 

2059
00:32:33,039 --> 00:32:35,190
between kind of in between but
it'd be nice if machine learning somehow

2060
00:32:35,190 --> 00:32:35,200
it'd be nice if machine learning somehow
 

2061
00:32:35,200 --> 00:32:37,190
it'd be nice if machine learning somehow
helped us discover the unification of

00:32:37,190 --> 00:32:37,200
helped us discover the unification of
 

2063
00:32:37,200 --> 00:32:38,549
helped us discover the unification of
the two as opposed to some of the

2064
00:32:38,549 --> 00:32:38,559
the two as opposed to some of the
 

2065
00:32:38,559 --> 00:32:40,789
the two as opposed to some of the
in-between

2066

in-between
 

2067
00:32:40,799 --> 00:32:42,549
in-between
but you're right that's you're you're

2068
00:32:42,549 --> 00:32:42,559
but you're right that's you're you're
 

2069
00:32:42,559 --> 00:32:44,870
but you're right that's you're you're
kind of trying to juggle both

2070
00:32:44,870 --> 00:32:44,880
kind of trying to juggle both
 

2071
00:32:44,880 --> 00:32:46,630
kind of trying to juggle both
so do you think there's still beautiful

2072
00:32:46,630 --> 00:32:46,640
so do you think there's still beautiful
 

2073
00:32:46,640 --> 00:32:48,310
so do you think there's still beautiful
and mysterious properties in your

2074
00:32:48,310 --> 00:32:48,320
and mysterious properties in your
 

2075
00:32:48,320 --> 00:32:50,149
and mysterious properties in your
networks that are yet to be discovered

2076
00:32:50,149 --> 00:32:50,159
networks that are yet to be discovered
 

2077
00:32:50,159 --> 00:32:52,310
networks that are yet to be discovered
definitely i think that we are still

2078
00:32:52,310 --> 00:32:52,320
definitely i think that we are still
 

2079
00:32:52,320 --> 00:32:55,269
definitely i think that we are still
massively underestimating deep learning

2080
00:32:55,269 --> 00:32:55,279
massively underestimating deep learning
 

2081
00:32:55,279 --> 00:32:56,870
massively underestimating deep learning
what do you think it will look like like

2082
00:32:56,870 --> 00:32:56,880
what do you think it will look like like
 

2083
00:32:56,880 --> 00:32:59,190
what do you think it will look like like
what if i knew i would have done it

2084
00:32:59,190 --> 00:32:59,200
what if i knew i would have done it
 

2085
00:32:59,200 --> 00:33:02,549
what if i knew i would have done it
yeah so uh

2086
00:33:02,549 --> 00:33:02,559
yeah so uh
 

2087
00:33:02,559 --> 00:33:04,070
yeah so uh
but if you look at all the progress from

2088
00:33:04,070 --> 00:33:04,080
but if you look at all the progress from
 

2089
00:33:04,080 --> 00:33:06,950
but if you look at all the progress from
the past 10 years i would say most of it

2090
00:33:06,950 --> 00:33:06,960
the past 10 years i would say most of it
 

2091
00:33:06,960 --> 00:33:08,789
the past 10 years i would say most of it
i would say there have been a few cases

2092
00:33:08,789 --> 00:33:08,799
i would say there have been a few cases
 

2093
00:33:08,799 --> 00:33:10,710
i would say there have been a few cases
where some were things that

2094
00:33:10,710 --> 00:33:10,720
where some were things that
 

2095
00:33:10,720 --> 00:33:12,950
where some were things that
felt like really new ideas showed up but

2096
00:33:12,950 --> 00:33:12,960
felt like really new ideas showed up but
 

2097
00:33:12,960 --> 00:33:14,549
felt like really new ideas showed up but
by and large it was

2098
00:33:14,549 --> 00:33:14,559
by and large it was
 

2099
00:33:14,559 --> 00:33:16,230
by and large it was
every year we thought okay deep learning

2100
00:33:16,230 --> 00:33:16,240
every year we thought okay deep learning
 

2101
00:33:16,240 --> 00:33:18,070
every year we thought okay deep learning
goes this far nope it actually goes

2102
00:33:18,070 --> 00:33:18,080
goes this far nope it actually goes
 

2103
00:33:18,080 --> 00:33:18,950
goes this far nope it actually goes
further

2104
00:33:18,950 --> 00:33:18,960
further
 

2105
00:33:18,960 --> 00:33:21,110
further
and then the next year okay now you now

2106
00:33:21,110 --> 00:33:21,120
and then the next year okay now you now
 

2107
00:33:21,120 --> 00:33:22,470
and then the next year okay now you now
this is this is peak deep learning we

2108
00:33:22,470 --> 00:33:22,480
this is this is peak deep learning we
 

2109
00:33:22,480 --> 00:33:23,430
this is this is peak deep learning we
are really done nope

2110
00:33:23,430 --> 00:33:23,440
are really done nope
 

2111
00:33:23,440 --> 00:33:25,269
are really done nope
goes further it just keeps going further

2112
00:33:25,269 --> 00:33:25,279
goes further it just keeps going further
 

2113
00:33:25,279 --> 00:33:26,870
goes further it just keeps going further
each year so that means that we keep

2114
00:33:26,870 --> 00:33:26,880
each year so that means that we keep
 

2115
00:33:26,880 --> 00:33:28,070
each year so that means that we keep
underestimating we keep not

you think it's getting harder and harder

2122
00:33:33,430 --> 00:33:33,440
you think it's getting harder and harder
 

2123
00:33:33,440 --> 00:33:35,830
you think it's getting harder and harder
to make progress need to make progress

2124
00:33:35,830 --> 00:33:35,840
to make progress need to make progress
 

2125
00:33:35,840 --> 00:33:37,029
to make progress need to make progress
it depends on what we mean i think the

2126
00:33:37,029 --> 00:33:37,039
it depends on what we mean i think the
 

2127
00:33:37,039 --> 00:33:37,990
it depends on what we mean i think the

00:33:38,000 --> 00:33:41,029
field will continue to make
very robust progress for quite a while

2130
00:33:41,029 --> 00:33:41,039
very robust progress for quite a while
 

2131
00:33:41,039 --> 00:33:42,789
very robust progress for quite a while
i think for individual researchers

2132
00:33:42,789 --> 00:33:42,799
i think for individual researchers
 

2133
00:33:42,799 --> 00:33:44,549
i think for individual researchers
especially people who are doing

2134
00:33:44,549 --> 00:33:44,559
especially people who are doing
 

2135
00:33:44,559 --> 00:33:47,029
especially people who are doing
um research it can be harder because

2136
00:33:47,029 --> 00:33:47,039
um research it can be harder because
 

2137
00:33:47,039 --> 00:33:48,230
um research it can be harder because
there is a very large number of

2138
00:33:48,230 --> 00:33:48,240
there is a very large number of
 

2139
00:33:48,240 --> 00:33:49,990
there is a very large number of
researchers right now

2140
00:33:49,990 --> 00:33:50,000
researchers right now
 

2141
00:33:50,000 --> 00:33:51,110
researchers right now
i think that if you have a lot of

2142
00:33:51,110 --> 00:33:51,120
i think that if you have a lot of
 

2143
00:33:51,120 --> 00:33:53,190
i think that if you have a lot of
compute then you can make

2144
00:33:53,190 --> 00:33:53,200
compute then you can make
 

2145
00:33:53,200 --> 00:33:54,630
compute then you can make
a lot of very interesting discoveries

2146
00:33:54,630 --> 00:33:54,640
a lot of very interesting discoveries
 

2147
00:33:54,640 --> 00:33:56,789
a lot of very interesting discoveries
but then you have to deal with

2148
00:33:56,789 --> 00:33:56,799
but then you have to deal with
 

2149
00:33:56,799 --> 00:34:00,070
but then you have to deal with
the challenge of managing a huge compute

2150
00:34:00,070 --> 00:34:00,080
the challenge of managing a huge compute
 

2151
00:34:00,080 --> 00:34:01,909
the challenge of managing a huge compute
a huge classic compute cluster trying to

2152
00:34:01,909 --> 00:34:01,919
a huge classic compute cluster trying to
 

2153
00:34:01,919 --> 00:34:03,269
a huge classic compute cluster trying to
experiment so it's a little bit harder

2154
00:34:03,269 --> 00:34:03,279
experiment so it's a little bit harder
 

2155
00:34:03,279 --> 00:34:04,950
experiment so it's a little bit harder
so i'm asking all these questions that

2156
00:34:04,950 --> 00:34:04,960
so i'm asking all these questions that
 

2157
00:34:04,960 --> 00:34:06,389
so i'm asking all these questions that
nobody knows the answer to

2158
00:34:06,389 --> 00:34:06,399
nobody knows the answer to
 

2159
00:34:06,399 --> 00:34:08,069
nobody knows the answer to
but you're one of the smartest people i

2160
00:34:08,069 --> 00:34:08,079
but you're one of the smartest people i
 

2161
00:34:08,079 --> 00:34:09,829
but you're one of the smartest people i
know so i'm going to keep asking

2162
00:34:09,829 --> 00:34:09,839
know so i'm going to keep asking
 

2163
00:34:09,839 --> 00:34:11,829
know so i'm going to keep asking
the so let's imagine all the

2164
00:34:11,829 --> 00:34:11,839
the so let's imagine all the
 

2165
00:34:11,839 --> 00:34:13,510
the so let's imagine all the
breakthroughs that happen in the next 30

do you think most of those breakthroughs

2170
00:34:17,109 --> 00:34:17,119
do you think most of those breakthroughs
 

2171
00:34:17,119 --> 00:34:19,510
do you think most of those breakthroughs
can be done by one person

2172
00:34:19,510 --> 00:34:19,520
can be done by one person
 

2173
00:34:19,520 --> 00:34:22,950
can be done by one person
with one computer sort of in the space

2174
00:34:22,950 --> 00:34:22,960
with one computer sort of in the space
 

2175
00:34:22,960 --> 00:34:24,310
with one computer sort of in the space
of breakthroughs do you think

00:34:24,310 --> 00:34:24,320
of breakthroughs do you think

compute will be compute
 

2179
00:34:27,599 --> 00:34:32,149

i mean i can't be sure when you say one

2182
00:34:34,470 --> 00:34:34,480
i mean i can't be sure when you say one
 

2183
00:34:34,480 --> 00:34:35,510
i mean i can't be sure when you say one
computer you mean

2184
00:34:35,510 --> 00:34:35,520
computer you mean
 

2185
00:34:35,520 --> 00:34:38,710

how large uh

2186
00:34:38,710 --> 00:34:38,720
how large uh
 

2187
00:34:38,720 --> 00:34:41,430
how large uh
you're uh you're clever i mean one can

2188
00:34:41,430 --> 00:34:41,440
you're uh you're clever i mean one can
 

2189
00:34:41,440 --> 00:34:42,550
you're uh you're clever i mean one can

one gpu
 

2191
00:34:42,560 --> 00:34:47,430

00:34:48,960 --> 00:34:50,950
i think it's pretty unlikely i think
that there are many

to be quite deep
if you look at it you've got all the way

00:34:56,310 --> 00:34:56,320
if you look at it you've got all the way
 

2203
00:34:56,320 --> 00:34:58,150
if you look at it you've got all the way
from

2204
00:34:58,150 --> 00:34:58,160
from
 

2205
00:34:58,160 --> 00:35:01,109
from
the ideas the systems to build the data

2206
00:35:01,109 --> 00:35:01,119
the ideas the systems to build the data
 

2207
00:35:01,119 --> 00:35:01,990
the ideas the systems to build the data
sets

the gpu programming putting it all
 

2215
00:35:08,560 --> 00:35:09,990
the gpu programming putting it all
together so now the stack is getting

2216
00:35:09,990 --> 00:35:10,000
together so now the stack is getting
 

2217
00:35:10,000 --> 00:35:12,150
together so now the stack is getting
really deep and i think it becomes

2218
00:35:12,150 --> 00:35:12,160
really deep and i think it becomes
 

2219
00:35:12,160 --> 00:35:13,990
really deep and i think it becomes
it can be quite hard for a single person

it can be quite hard for a single person
 

2221
00:35:14,000 --> 00:35:16,230
it can be quite hard for a single person
to become to be world class in every

so being able to learn more efficiently

2234
00:35:29,030 --> 00:35:29,040
so being able to learn more efficiently
 

2235
00:35:29,040 --> 00:35:30,790
so being able to learn more efficiently
do you think that's there'll be

2236
00:35:30,790 --> 00:35:30,800
do you think that's there'll be
 

2237
00:35:30,800 --> 00:35:32,950
do you think that's there'll be
breakthroughs in that space that would

2238
00:35:32,950 --> 00:35:32,960
breakthroughs in that space that would
 

2239
00:35:32,960 --> 00:35:35,109

may not need the huge compute i think it

2240
00:35:35,109 --> 00:35:35,119
may not need the huge compute i think it
 

2241
00:35:35,119 --> 00:35:36,069
may not need the huge compute i think it
will be a very

2242
00:35:36,069 --> 00:35:36,079
will be a very
 

2243
00:35:36,079 --> 00:35:37,349
will be a very
i think there will be a large number of

2244
00:35:37,349 --> 00:35:37,359
i think there will be a large number of
 

2245
00:35:37,359 --> 00:35:38,710
i think there will be a large number of
breakthroughs in general that will not

2246
00:35:38,710 --> 00:35:38,720
breakthroughs in general that will not
 

2247
00:35:38,720 --> 00:35:40,470
breakthroughs in general that will not
need a huge amount of compute

2248
00:35:40,470 --> 00:35:40,480
need a huge amount of compute
 

2249
00:35:40,480 --> 00:35:42,310
need a huge amount of compute
so maybe i should clarify that i think

2250
00:35:42,310 --> 00:35:42,320
so maybe i should clarify that i think
 

2251
00:35:42,320 --> 00:35:43,990
so maybe i should clarify that i think
that some breakthroughs will require a

2252
00:35:43,990 --> 00:35:44,000
that some breakthroughs will require a
 

2253
00:35:44,000 --> 00:35:45,270
that some breakthroughs will require a
lot of compute

2254
00:35:45,270 --> 00:35:45,280
lot of compute
 

2255
00:35:45,280 --> 00:35:47,510
lot of compute
and i think building systems which

2256
00:35:47,510 --> 00:35:47,520
and i think building systems which
 

2257
00:35:47,520 --> 00:35:49,190
and i think building systems which
actually do things will require a huge

2258
00:35:49,190 --> 00:35:49,200
actually do things will require a huge
 

2259
00:35:49,200 --> 00:35:50,069
actually do things will require a huge
amount of compute

2260
00:35:50,069 --> 00:35:50,079
amount of compute
 

2261
00:35:50,079 --> 00:35:51,670
amount of compute
that one is pretty obvious if you want

2262
00:35:51,670 --> 00:35:51,680
that one is pretty obvious if you want
 

2263
00:35:51,680 --> 00:35:53,190
that one is pretty obvious if you want
to do x

2264
00:35:53,190 --> 00:35:53,200
to do x
 

2265
00:35:53,200 --> 00:35:54,630
to do x
right an x requires a huge neural net

2266
00:35:54,630 --> 00:35:54,640
right an x requires a huge neural net
 

2267
00:35:54,640 --> 00:35:56,550
right an x requires a huge neural net
you got to get a huge neural net

2268
00:35:56,550 --> 00:35:56,560
you got to get a huge neural net
 

2269
00:35:56,560 --> 00:35:59,270
you got to get a huge neural net
but i think there will be lots of i

2270
00:35:59,270 --> 00:35:59,280
but i think there will be lots of i
 

2271
00:35:59,280 --> 00:36:01,430
but i think there will be lots of i
think there is lots of room for

2272
00:36:01,430 --> 00:36:01,440
think there is lots of room for
 

2273
00:36:01,440 --> 00:36:03,270
think there is lots of room for
very important work being done by small

2274
00:36:03,270 --> 00:36:03,280
very important work being done by small

you released
 

2285
00:36:13,359 --> 00:36:15,910

sure that deep double descent where

2286
00:36:15,910 --> 00:36:15,920
sure that deep double descent where
 

2287
00:36:15,920 --> 00:36:16,870
sure that deep double descent where
bigger models

2288
00:36:16,870 --> 00:36:16,880
bigger models
 

2289
00:36:16,880 --> 00:36:18,790
bigger models
and more data hurt i think it's really

2290
00:36:18,790 --> 00:36:18,800
and more data hurt i think it's really
 

2291
00:36:18,800 --> 00:36:20,150
and more data hurt i think it's really
interesting paper can you can you

2292
00:36:20,150 --> 00:36:20,160
interesting paper can you can you
 

2293
00:36:20,160 --> 00:36:22,310
interesting paper can you can you
describe the main idea and

2294
00:36:22,310 --> 00:36:22,320
describe the main idea and
 

2295
00:36:22,320 --> 00:36:24,630
describe the main idea and
yeah definitely so what happened is that

2296
00:36:24,630 --> 00:36:24,640
yeah definitely so what happened is that
 

2297
00:36:24,640 --> 00:36:25,750
yeah definitely so what happened is that
some

2298
00:36:25,750 --> 00:36:25,760
some
 

2299
00:36:25,760 --> 00:36:27,829
some
over over the years some small number of

2300
00:36:27,829 --> 00:36:27,839
over over the years some small number of
 

2301
00:36:27,839 --> 00:36:29,430
over over the years some small number of
researchers noticed that

2302
00:36:29,430 --> 00:36:29,440
researchers noticed that
 

2303
00:36:29,440 --> 00:36:30,630
researchers noticed that
it is kind of weird that when you make

2304
00:36:30,630 --> 00:36:30,640
it is kind of weird that when you make
 

2305
00:36:30,640 --> 00:36:31,829
it is kind of weird that when you make
the neural network larger it works

2306
00:36:31,829 --> 00:36:31,839
the neural network larger it works
 

2307
00:36:31,839 --> 00:36:32,710
the neural network larger it works
better and it seems to go in

2308
00:36:32,710 --> 00:36:32,720
better and it seems to go in
 

2309
00:36:32,720 --> 00:36:34,630
better and it seems to go in
contradiction with statistical ideas

2310
00:36:34,630 --> 00:36:34,640
contradiction with statistical ideas
 

2311
00:36:34,640 --> 00:36:36,470
contradiction with statistical ideas
and then some people made an analysis

2312
00:36:36,470 --> 00:36:36,480
and then some people made an analysis
 

2313
00:36:36,480 --> 00:36:37,670
and then some people made an analysis
showing that actually you got this

2314
00:36:37,670 --> 00:36:37,680
showing that actually you got this
 

2315
00:36:37,680 --> 00:36:38,790
showing that actually you got this
double descent bump

2316
00:36:38,790 --> 00:36:38,800
double descent bump
 

2317
00:36:38,800 --> 00:36:41,349
double descent bump
and what we've done was to show that

2318
00:36:41,349 --> 00:36:41,359
and what we've done was to show that
 

2319
00:36:41,359 --> 00:36:42,710
and what we've done was to show that
double descent occurs

2320
00:36:42,710 --> 00:36:42,720
double descent occurs
 

2321
00:36:42,720 --> 00:36:44,550
double descent occurs
for all for pretty much all practical

2322
00:36:44,550 --> 00:36:44,560
for all for pretty much all practical
 

2323
00:36:44,560 --> 00:36:46,310
for all for pretty much all practical
deep learning systems

2324
00:36:46,310 --> 00:36:46,320
deep learning systems
 

2325
00:36:46,320 --> 00:36:49,190
deep learning systems
and that it'll be also so can you step

2326
00:36:49,190 --> 00:36:49,200
and that it'll be also so can you step
 

2327
00:36:49,200 --> 00:36:50,470
and that it'll be also so can you step
back

2328
00:36:50,470 --> 00:36:50,480
back
 

2329
00:36:50,480 --> 00:36:54,069
back
uh what's the x-axis and the y-axis of a

2330
00:36:54,069 --> 00:36:54,079
uh what's the x-axis and the y-axis of a
 

2331
00:36:54,079 --> 00:36:55,910
uh what's the x-axis and the y-axis of a
double descent plot

2332
00:36:55,910 --> 00:36:55,920
double descent plot
 

2333
00:36:55,920 --> 00:36:59,030
double descent plot
okay great so you can you can look you

2334
00:36:59,030 --> 00:36:59,040
okay great so you can you can look you
 

2335
00:36:59,040 --> 00:37:00,790
okay great so you can you can look you
can

2336
00:37:00,790 --> 00:37:00,800
can
 

2337
00:37:00,800 --> 00:37:03,270
can
do things like you can take a neural

2338
00:37:03,270 --> 00:37:03,280
do things like you can take a neural
 

2339
00:37:03,280 --> 00:37:04,790
do things like you can take a neural
network

2340
00:37:04,790 --> 00:37:04,800
network
 

2341
00:37:04,800 --> 00:37:06,310
network
and you can start increasing its size

2342
00:37:06,310 --> 00:37:06,320
and you can start increasing its size
 

2343
00:37:06,320 --> 00:37:09,990
and you can start increasing its size
slowly while keeping your data set fixed

2344
00:37:09,990 --> 00:37:10,000
slowly while keeping your data set fixed
 

2345
00:37:10,000 --> 00:37:12,790
slowly while keeping your data set fixed
so if you increase the size of the

2346
00:37:12,790 --> 00:37:12,800
so if you increase the size of the
 

2347
00:37:12,800 --> 00:37:14,710
so if you increase the size of the
neural network slowly

2348
00:37:14,710 --> 00:37:14,720
neural network slowly
 

2349
00:37:14,720 --> 00:37:16,790
neural network slowly
and if you don't do early stopping

2350
00:37:16,790 --> 00:37:16,800
and if you don't do early stopping
 

2351
00:37:16,800 --> 00:37:18,069
and if you don't do early stopping
that's a pretty important

2352
00:37:18,069 --> 00:37:18,079
that's a pretty important
 

2353
00:37:18,079 --> 00:37:21,109
that's a pretty important
detail then

2354
00:37:21,109 --> 00:37:21,119
detail then
 

2355
00:37:21,119 --> 00:37:22,390
detail then
when the neural network is really small

2356
00:37:22,390 --> 00:37:22,400
when the neural network is really small
 

2357
00:37:22,400 --> 00:37:24,230
when the neural network is really small
you make it larger you get a very rapid

2358
00:37:24,230 --> 00:37:24,240
you make it larger you get a very rapid
 

2359
00:37:24,240 --> 00:37:25,910
you make it larger you get a very rapid
increase in performance

2360
00:37:25,910 --> 00:37:25,920
increase in performance
 

2361
00:37:25,920 --> 00:37:27,190
increase in performance
then you continue to make it large and

2362
00:37:27,190 --> 00:37:27,200
then you continue to make it large and
 

2363
00:37:27,200 --> 00:37:29,990
then you continue to make it large and
at some point performance will get worse

2364
00:37:29,990 --> 00:37:30,000
at some point performance will get worse
 

2365
00:37:30,000 --> 00:37:32,630
at some point performance will get worse
and it gets and and it gets the worst

2366
00:37:32,630 --> 00:37:32,640
and it gets and and it gets the worst
 

2367
00:37:32,640 --> 00:37:34,390
and it gets and and it gets the worst
exactly at the point at which it

2368
00:37:34,390 --> 00:37:34,400
exactly at the point at which it
 

2369
00:37:34,400 --> 00:37:35,109
exactly at the point at which it
achieves

2370
00:37:35,109 --> 00:37:35,119
achieves
 

2371
00:37:35,119 --> 00:37:36,950
achieves
zero training error precisely zero

2372
00:37:36,950 --> 00:37:36,960
zero training error precisely zero
 

2373
00:37:36,960 --> 00:37:38,470
zero training error precisely zero
training loss

2374
00:37:38,470 --> 00:37:38,480
training loss
 

2375
00:37:38,480 --> 00:37:39,750
training loss
and then as you make it large it starts

2376
00:37:39,750 --> 00:37:39,760
and then as you make it large it starts
 

2377
00:37:39,760 --> 00:37:41,910
and then as you make it large it starts
to get better again and it's kind of

2378
00:37:41,910 --> 00:37:41,920
to get better again and it's kind of
 

2379
00:37:41,920 --> 00:37:43,589
to get better again and it's kind of
counter-intuitive because you'd expect

2380
00:37:43,589 --> 00:37:43,599
counter-intuitive because you'd expect
 

2381
00:37:43,599 --> 00:37:45,030
counter-intuitive because you'd expect
deep learning phenomena to be

2382
00:37:45,030 --> 00:37:45,040
deep learning phenomena to be
 

2383
00:37:45,040 --> 00:37:48,230
deep learning phenomena to be
monotonic and

2384
00:37:48,230 --> 00:37:48,240
monotonic and
 

2385
00:37:48,240 --> 00:37:50,069
monotonic and
it's hard to be sure what it means but

2386
00:37:50,069 --> 00:37:50,079
it's hard to be sure what it means but
 

2387
00:37:50,079 --> 00:37:52,230
it's hard to be sure what it means but
it also occurs in in the case of linear

2388
00:37:52,230 --> 00:37:52,240
it also occurs in in the case of linear
 

2389
00:37:52,240 --> 00:37:54,150
it also occurs in in the case of linear
classifiers and the intuition basically

2390
00:37:54,150 --> 00:37:54,160
classifiers and the intuition basically
 

2391
00:37:54,160 --> 00:37:56,950
classifiers and the intuition basically
boils down to the following

2392
00:37:56,950 --> 00:37:56,960
boils down to the following
 

2393
00:37:56,960 --> 00:37:59,190
boils down to the following
when you when you have a lot when you

2394
00:37:59,190 --> 00:37:59,200
when you when you have a lot when you
 

2395
00:37:59,200 --> 00:38:00,230
when you when you have a lot when you
have

2396
00:38:00,230 --> 00:38:00,240
have
 

2397
00:38:00,240 --> 00:38:03,430
have
a large data set and a small model

2398
00:38:03,430 --> 00:38:03,440
a large data set and a small model
 

2399
00:38:03,440 --> 00:38:05,910
a large data set and a small model
then small tiny random so basically what

2400
00:38:05,910 --> 00:38:05,920
then small tiny random so basically what
 

2401
00:38:05,920 --> 00:38:07,030
then small tiny random so basically what
is overfitting

2402
00:38:07,030 --> 00:38:07,040
is overfitting
 

2403
00:38:07,040 --> 00:38:10,310
is overfitting
overfitting is when your model

2404
00:38:10,310 --> 00:38:10,320
overfitting is when your model
 

2405
00:38:10,320 --> 00:38:12,630
overfitting is when your model
is somehow very sensitive to the small

2406
00:38:12,630 --> 00:38:12,640
is somehow very sensitive to the small
 

2407
00:38:12,640 --> 00:38:14,150
is somehow very sensitive to the small
random

2408
00:38:14,150 --> 00:38:14,160
random
 

2409
00:38:14,160 --> 00:38:16,310
random
unimportant stuff in your data set in a

2410
00:38:16,310 --> 00:38:16,320
unimportant stuff in your data set in a
 

2411
00:38:16,320 --> 00:38:17,910
unimportant stuff in your data set in a
training day in the training data set

2412
00:38:17,910 --> 00:38:17,920
training day in the training data set
 

2413
00:38:17,920 --> 00:38:18,950
training day in the training data set
precisely

2414
00:38:18,950 --> 00:38:18,960
precisely
 

2415
00:38:18,960 --> 00:38:21,510
precisely
so if you have a small model and you

2416
00:38:21,510 --> 00:38:21,520
so if you have a small model and you
 

2417
00:38:21,520 --> 00:38:23,190
so if you have a small model and you
have a big data set

2418
00:38:23,190 --> 00:38:23,200
have a big data set
 

2419
00:38:23,200 --> 00:38:24,550
have a big data set
and there may be some random thing you

2420
00:38:24,550 --> 00:38:24,560
and there may be some random thing you
 

2421
00:38:24,560 --> 00:38:26,870
and there may be some random thing you
know some training cases are randomly in

2422
00:38:26,870 --> 00:38:26,880
know some training cases are randomly in
 

2423
00:38:26,880 --> 00:38:28,950
know some training cases are randomly in
the data set and others may not be there

2424
00:38:28,950 --> 00:38:28,960
the data set and others may not be there
 

2425
00:38:28,960 --> 00:38:30,710
the data set and others may not be there
but the small mod but the small model is

2426
00:38:30,710 --> 00:38:30,720
but the small mod but the small model is
 

2427
00:38:30,720 --> 00:38:32,310
but the small mod but the small model is
kind of insensitive to this randomness

2428
00:38:32,310 --> 00:38:32,320
kind of insensitive to this randomness
 

2429
00:38:32,320 --> 00:38:33,349
kind of insensitive to this randomness
because

2430
00:38:33,349 --> 00:38:33,359
because
 

2431
00:38:33,359 --> 00:38:35,270
because
it's the same you there is pretty much

2432
00:38:35,270 --> 00:38:35,280
it's the same you there is pretty much
 

2433
00:38:35,280 --> 00:38:36,870
it's the same you there is pretty much
no uncertainty about the model

2434
00:38:36,870 --> 00:38:36,880
no uncertainty about the model
 

2435
00:38:36,880 --> 00:38:39,349
no uncertainty about the model
when it is that it's large so okay so at

2436
00:38:39,349 --> 00:38:39,359
when it is that it's large so okay so at
 

2437
00:38:39,359 --> 00:38:41,109
when it is that it's large so okay so at
the very basic level to me

2438
00:38:41,109 --> 00:38:41,119
the very basic level to me
 

2439
00:38:41,119 --> 00:38:45,190
the very basic level to me
it is the most surprising thing that

2440
00:38:45,190 --> 00:38:45,200
it is the most surprising thing that
 

2441
00:38:45,200 --> 00:38:48,630
it is the most surprising thing that
neural networks don't overfit every time

2442
00:38:48,630 --> 00:38:48,640
neural networks don't overfit every time
 

2443
00:38:48,640 --> 00:38:51,750
neural networks don't overfit every time
very quickly uh

2444
00:38:51,750 --> 00:38:51,760
very quickly uh
 

2445
00:38:51,760 --> 00:38:53,910
very quickly uh
before ever being able to learn anything

2446
00:38:53,910 --> 00:38:53,920
before ever being able to learn anything
 

2447
00:38:53,920 --> 00:38:56,230
before ever being able to learn anything
the huge number of parameters

2448
00:38:56,230 --> 00:38:56,240
the huge number of parameters
 

2449
00:38:56,240 --> 00:38:57,990
the huge number of parameters
so here so there is one way okay so

2450
00:38:57,990 --> 00:38:58,000
so here so there is one way okay so
 

2451
00:38:58,000 --> 00:38:59,589
so here so there is one way okay so
maybe so let me try to give the

2452
00:38:59,589 --> 00:38:59,599
maybe so let me try to give the
 

2453
00:38:59,599 --> 00:39:00,150
maybe so let me try to give the
explanation

2454
00:39:00,150 --> 00:39:00,160
explanation
 

2455
00:39:00,160 --> 00:39:02,550
explanation
maybe that will be that will work so you

2456
00:39:02,550 --> 00:39:02,560
maybe that will be that will work so you
 

2457
00:39:02,560 --> 00:39:03,910
maybe that will be that will work so you
got a huge neural network let's suppose

2458
00:39:03,910 --> 00:39:03,920
got a huge neural network let's suppose
 

2459
00:39:03,920 --> 00:39:05,829
got a huge neural network let's suppose
you've got a

2460
00:39:05,829 --> 00:39:05,839
you've got a
 

2461
00:39:05,839 --> 00:39:07,430
you've got a
you are you have a huge neural network

2462
00:39:07,430 --> 00:39:07,440
you are you have a huge neural network
 

2463
00:39:07,440 --> 00:39:09,589
you are you have a huge neural network
you have a huge number of parameters

2464
00:39:09,589 --> 00:39:09,599
you have a huge number of parameters
 

2465
00:39:09,599 --> 00:39:10,870
you have a huge number of parameters
and now let's pretend everything is

2466
00:39:10,870 --> 00:39:10,880
and now let's pretend everything is
 

2467
00:39:10,880 --> 00:39:13,030
and now let's pretend everything is
linear which is not let's just pretend

2468
00:39:13,030 --> 00:39:13,040
linear which is not let's just pretend
 

2469
00:39:13,040 --> 00:39:15,670
linear which is not let's just pretend
then there is this big subspace where a

2470
00:39:15,670 --> 00:39:15,680
then there is this big subspace where a
 

2471
00:39:15,680 --> 00:39:17,910
then there is this big subspace where a
neural network achieves zero error

2472
00:39:17,910 --> 00:39:17,920
neural network achieves zero error
 

2473
00:39:17,920 --> 00:39:21,030
neural network achieves zero error
and sdgt is going to find approximately

2474
00:39:21,030 --> 00:39:21,040
and sdgt is going to find approximately
 

2475
00:39:21,040 --> 00:39:21,750
and sdgt is going to find approximately
the point

2476
00:39:21,750 --> 00:39:21,760
the point
 

2477
00:39:21,760 --> 00:39:23,430
the point
that's right approximately the point

2478
00:39:23,430 --> 00:39:23,440
that's right approximately the point
 

2479
00:39:23,440 --> 00:39:26,550
that's right approximately the point
with the smallest norm in that subspace

2480
00:39:26,550 --> 00:39:26,560
with the smallest norm in that subspace
 

2481
00:39:26,560 --> 00:39:29,349
with the smallest norm in that subspace
okay and that can also be proven to be

2482
00:39:29,349 --> 00:39:29,359
okay and that can also be proven to be
 

2483
00:39:29,359 --> 00:39:30,710
okay and that can also be proven to be
insensitive to

2484
00:39:30,710 --> 00:39:30,720
insensitive to
 

2485
00:39:30,720 --> 00:39:33,510
insensitive to
the small randomness in the data when

2486
00:39:33,510 --> 00:39:33,520
the small randomness in the data when
 

2487
00:39:33,520 --> 00:39:35,270
the small randomness in the data when
the dimensionality is high

2488
00:39:35,270 --> 00:39:35,280
the dimensionality is high
 

2489
00:39:35,280 --> 00:39:37,109
the dimensionality is high
but when the dimensionality of the data

2490
00:39:37,109 --> 00:39:37,119
but when the dimensionality of the data
 

2491
00:39:37,119 --> 00:39:38,630
but when the dimensionality of the data
is equal to the dimensionality of the

2492
00:39:38,630 --> 00:39:38,640
is equal to the dimensionality of the
 

2493
00:39:38,640 --> 00:39:39,190
is equal to the dimensionality of the
model

2494
00:39:39,190 --> 00:39:39,200
model
 

2495
00:39:39,200 --> 00:39:40,230
model
then there is a one-to-one

2496
00:39:40,230 --> 00:39:40,240
then there is a one-to-one
 

2497
00:39:40,240 --> 00:39:43,270
then there is a one-to-one
correspondence between all the data sets

2498
00:39:43,270 --> 00:39:43,280
correspondence between all the data sets
 

2499
00:39:43,280 --> 00:39:45,190
correspondence between all the data sets
and the models so small changes in the

2500
00:39:45,190 --> 00:39:45,200
and the models so small changes in the
 

2501
00:39:45,200 --> 00:39:46,790
and the models so small changes in the
data set actually lead to large changes

2502
00:39:46,790 --> 00:39:46,800
data set actually lead to large changes
 

2503
00:39:46,800 --> 00:39:48,069
data set actually lead to large changes
in the model and that's why performance

2504
00:39:48,069 --> 00:39:48,079
in the model and that's why performance
 

2505
00:39:48,079 --> 00:39:48,630
in the model and that's why performance
gets worse

2506
00:39:48,630 --> 00:39:48,640
gets worse
 

2507
00:39:48,640 --> 00:39:50,069
gets worse
so this is the best explanation more or

2508
00:39:50,069 --> 00:39:50,079
so this is the best explanation more or
 

2509
00:39:50,079 --> 00:39:52,230
so this is the best explanation more or
less

2510
00:39:52,230 --> 00:39:52,240
less
 

2511
00:39:52,240 --> 00:39:53,910
less
so then it would be good for the model

2512
00:39:53,910 --> 00:39:53,920
so then it would be good for the model
 

2513
00:39:53,920 --> 00:39:56,150
so then it would be good for the model
to have more parameters

2514
00:39:56,150 --> 00:39:56,160
to have more parameters
 

2515
00:39:56,160 --> 00:39:58,790
to have more parameters
so to be bigger than the data that's

2516
00:39:58,790 --> 00:39:58,800
so to be bigger than the data that's
 

2517
00:39:58,800 --> 00:39:59,430
so to be bigger than the data that's
right but

2518
00:39:59,430 --> 00:39:59,440
right but
 

2519
00:39:59,440 --> 00:40:00,950
right but
only if you don't really stop if you

2520
00:40:00,950 --> 00:40:00,960
only if you don't really stop if you
 

2521
00:40:00,960 --> 00:40:01,990
only if you don't really stop if you
introduce early stop in your

2522
00:40:01,990 --> 00:40:02,000
introduce early stop in your
 

2523
00:40:02,000 --> 00:40:03,430
introduce early stop in your
regularization you can make the double

2524
00:40:03,430 --> 00:40:03,440
regularization you can make the double
 

2525
00:40:03,440 --> 00:40:04,550
regularization you can make the double
asset descent bump

2526
00:40:04,550 --> 00:40:04,560
asset descent bump
 

2527
00:40:04,560 --> 00:40:06,390
asset descent bump
almost completely disappear what is

2528
00:40:06,390 --> 00:40:06,400
almost completely disappear what is
 

2529
00:40:06,400 --> 00:40:08,150
almost completely disappear what is
early stop early stopping is when

2530
00:40:08,150 --> 00:40:08,160
early stop early stopping is when
 

2531
00:40:08,160 --> 00:40:10,550
early stop early stopping is when
you train your model and you monitor

2532
00:40:10,550 --> 00:40:10,560
you train your model and you monitor
 

2533
00:40:10,560 --> 00:40:13,349
you train your model and you monitor
your test your validation performance

2534
00:40:13,349 --> 00:40:13,359
your test your validation performance
 

2535
00:40:13,359 --> 00:40:14,630
your test your validation performance
and then if at some point validation

2536
00:40:14,630 --> 00:40:14,640
and then if at some point validation
 

2537
00:40:14,640 --> 00:40:15,990
and then if at some point validation
performance starts to get worse you say

2538
00:40:15,990 --> 00:40:16,000
performance starts to get worse you say
 

2539
00:40:16,000 --> 00:40:17,430
performance starts to get worse you say
okay let's stop training

2540
00:40:17,430 --> 00:40:17,440
okay let's stop training
 

2541
00:40:17,440 --> 00:40:18,950
okay let's stop training
if you're good you're good you're good

2542
00:40:18,950 --> 00:40:18,960
if you're good you're good you're good
 

2543
00:40:18,960 --> 00:40:20,470
if you're good you're good you're good
enough so the

2544
00:40:20,470 --> 00:40:20,480
enough so the
 

2545
00:40:20,480 --> 00:40:22,790
enough so the
the magic happens after after that

2546
00:40:22,790 --> 00:40:22,800
the magic happens after after that
 

2547
00:40:22,800 --> 00:40:24,150
the magic happens after after that
moment so you don't want to do the early

2548
00:40:24,150 --> 00:40:24,160
moment so you don't want to do the early
 

2549
00:40:24,160 --> 00:40:24,950
moment so you don't want to do the early
stopping

2550
00:40:24,950 --> 00:40:24,960
stopping
 

2551
00:40:24,960 --> 00:40:26,550
stopping
well if you don't do the early stop and

2552
00:40:26,550 --> 00:40:26,560
well if you don't do the early stop and
 

2553
00:40:26,560 --> 00:40:27,829
well if you don't do the early stop and
you get this very you get a very

2554
00:40:27,829 --> 00:40:27,839
you get this very you get a very
 

2555
00:40:27,839 --> 00:40:30,630
you get this very you get a very
pronounced double descent

2556
00:40:30,630 --> 00:40:30,640
pronounced double descent
 

2557
00:40:30,640 --> 00:40:32,150
pronounced double descent
do you have any intuition why this

2558
00:40:32,150 --> 00:40:32,160
do you have any intuition why this
 

2559
00:40:32,160 --> 00:40:34,150
do you have any intuition why this
happens double descent

2560
00:40:34,150 --> 00:40:34,160
happens double descent
 

2561
00:40:34,160 --> 00:40:36,069
happens double descent
oh sorry are you stopping you no the

2562
00:40:36,069 --> 00:40:36,079
oh sorry are you stopping you no the
 

2563
00:40:36,079 --> 00:40:37,990
oh sorry are you stopping you no the
double descend so that oh yeah so i try

2564
00:40:37,990 --> 00:40:38,000
double descend so that oh yeah so i try
 

2565
00:40:38,000 --> 00:40:40,309
double descend so that oh yeah so i try
let's see the intuition is basically is

2566
00:40:40,309 --> 00:40:40,319
let's see the intuition is basically is
 

2567
00:40:40,319 --> 00:40:41,109
let's see the intuition is basically is
this

2568
00:40:41,109 --> 00:40:41,119
this
 

2569
00:40:41,119 --> 00:40:44,069
this
that when the data set has as many

2570
00:40:44,069 --> 00:40:44,079
that when the data set has as many
 

2571
00:40:44,079 --> 00:40:45,510
that when the data set has as many
degrees of freedom

2572
00:40:45,510 --> 00:40:45,520
degrees of freedom
 

2573
00:40:45,520 --> 00:40:48,390
degrees of freedom
as the model then there is a one-to-one

2574
00:40:48,390 --> 00:40:48,400
as the model then there is a one-to-one
 

2575
00:40:48,400 --> 00:40:49,670
as the model then there is a one-to-one
correspondence between them

2576
00:40:49,670 --> 00:40:49,680
correspondence between them
 

2577
00:40:49,680 --> 00:40:52,069
correspondence between them
and so small changes to the data set

2578
00:40:52,069 --> 00:40:52,079
and so small changes to the data set
 

2579
00:40:52,079 --> 00:40:53,910
and so small changes to the data set
lead to noticeable changes

2580
00:40:53,910 --> 00:40:53,920
lead to noticeable changes
 

2581
00:40:53,920 --> 00:40:55,910
lead to noticeable changes
in the model so your model is very

2582
00:40:55,910 --> 00:40:55,920
in the model so your model is very
 

2583
00:40:55,920 --> 00:40:57,510
in the model so your model is very
sensitive to all the randomness it is

2584
00:40:57,510 --> 00:40:57,520
sensitive to all the randomness it is
 

2585
00:40:57,520 --> 00:40:59,510
sensitive to all the randomness it is
unable to discard it

2586
00:40:59,510 --> 00:40:59,520
unable to discard it
 

2587
00:40:59,520 --> 00:41:02,790
unable to discard it
whereas it turns out that when you have

2588
00:41:02,790 --> 00:41:02,800
whereas it turns out that when you have
 

2589
00:41:02,800 --> 00:41:05,030
whereas it turns out that when you have
a lot more data than parameters or a lot

2590
00:41:05,030 --> 00:41:05,040
a lot more data than parameters or a lot
 

2591
00:41:05,040 --> 00:41:06,470
a lot more data than parameters or a lot
more parameters than data

2592
00:41:06,470 --> 00:41:06,480
more parameters than data
 

2593
00:41:06,480 --> 00:41:08,069
more parameters than data
the resulting solution will be

2594
00:41:08,069 --> 00:41:08,079
the resulting solution will be
 

2595
00:41:08,079 --> 00:41:10,069
the resulting solution will be
insensitive to small changes in the data

2596
00:41:10,069 --> 00:41:10,079
insensitive to small changes in the data
 

2597
00:41:10,079 --> 00:41:10,550
insensitive to small changes in the data
set

2598
00:41:10,550 --> 00:41:10,560

00:41:23,910 --> 00:41:23,920
back propagation we already kind of
 

2615
00:41:23,920 --> 00:41:25,670
back propagation we already kind of
talked about this a little bit but

2616
00:41:25,670 --> 00:41:25,680
talked about this a little bit but
 

2617
00:41:25,680 --> 00:41:27,190
talked about this a little bit but
he suggested that we just throw away

2618
00:41:27,190 --> 00:41:27,200
he suggested that we just throw away
 

2619
00:41:27,200 --> 00:41:29,670
he suggested that we just throw away
back propagation and start over

2620
00:41:29,670 --> 00:41:29,680
back propagation and start over
 

2621
00:41:29,680 --> 00:41:31,510
back propagation and start over
i mean of course some of that is a

2622
00:41:31,510 --> 00:41:31,520
i mean of course some of that is a
 

2623
00:41:31,520 --> 00:41:34,150
i mean of course some of that is a
little bit um

2624
00:41:34,150 --> 00:41:34,160
little bit um
 

2625
00:41:34,160 --> 00:41:36,710
little bit um
and humor but what do you think what

2626
00:41:36,710 --> 00:41:36,720
and humor but what do you think what
 

2627
00:41:36,720 --> 00:41:38,069
and humor but what do you think what
could be an alternative method of

2628
00:41:38,069 --> 00:41:38,079
could be an alternative method of
 

2629
00:41:38,079 --> 00:41:39,510
could be an alternative method of
training neural networks

2630
00:41:39,510 --> 00:41:39,520
training neural networks
 

2631
00:41:39,520 --> 00:41:41,430
training neural networks
well the thing that he said precisely is

2632
00:41:41,430 --> 00:41:41,440
well the thing that he said precisely is
 

2633
00:41:41,440 --> 00:41:43,510
well the thing that he said precisely is
that to the extent you can't find back

2634
00:41:43,510 --> 00:41:43,520
that to the extent you can't find back
 

2635
00:41:43,520 --> 00:41:45,109
that to the extent you can't find back
propagation in the brain

2636
00:41:45,109 --> 00:41:45,119
propagation in the brain
 

2637
00:41:45,119 --> 00:41:47,030
propagation in the brain
it's worth seeing if we can learn

2638
00:41:47,030 --> 00:41:47,040
it's worth seeing if we can learn
 

2639
00:41:47,040 --> 00:41:48,550
it's worth seeing if we can learn
something from how the brain

2640
00:41:48,550 --> 00:41:48,560
something from how the brain
 

2641
00:41:48,560 --> 00:41:50,069
something from how the brain
learns but back propagation is very

2642
00:41:50,069 --> 00:41:50,079
learns but back propagation is very
 

2643
00:41:50,079 --> 00:41:52,150
learns but back propagation is very
useful and we should keep using it

2644
00:41:52,150 --> 00:41:52,160
useful and we should keep using it
 

2645
00:41:52,160 --> 00:41:54,470
useful and we should keep using it
oh you're saying that once we discover

2646
00:41:54,470 --> 00:41:54,480
oh you're saying that once we discover
 

2647
00:41:54,480 --> 00:41:56,230
oh you're saying that once we discover
the mechanism of learning in the brain

2648
00:41:56,230 --> 00:41:56,240
the mechanism of learning in the brain
 

2649
00:41:56,240 --> 00:41:58,150
the mechanism of learning in the brain
or any aspects of that mechanism we

2650
00:41:58,150 --> 00:41:58,160
or any aspects of that mechanism we
 

2651
00:41:58,160 --> 00:41:58,550
or any aspects of that mechanism we
should

2652
00:41:58,550 --> 00:41:58,560
should
 

2653
00:41:58,560 --> 00:42:00,150
should
also try to implement that in neural

2654
00:42:00,150 --> 00:42:00,160
also try to implement that in neural
 

2655
00:42:00,160 --> 00:42:01,910
also try to implement that in neural
networks if it turns out that we can't

2656
00:42:01,910 --> 00:42:01,920
networks if it turns out that we can't
 

2657
00:42:01,920 --> 00:42:03,589
networks if it turns out that we can't
find back propagation in the brain

2658
00:42:03,589 --> 00:42:03,599
find back propagation in the brain
 

2659
00:42:03,599 --> 00:42:05,670
find back propagation in the brain
if we can't find bad propagation in the

2660
00:42:05,670 --> 00:42:05,680
if we can't find bad propagation in the
 

2661
00:42:05,680 --> 00:42:08,069
if we can't find bad propagation in the
brain

2662
00:42:08,069 --> 00:42:08,079

 

2663
00:42:08,079 --> 00:42:11,750

well so i guess your answer to that is

2664
00:42:11,750 --> 00:42:11,760
well so i guess your answer to that is
 

2665
00:42:11,760 --> 00:42:13,829
well so i guess your answer to that is
back propagation is pretty damn useful

2666
00:42:13,829 --> 00:42:13,839
back propagation is pretty damn useful
 

2667
00:42:13,839 --> 00:42:16,470
back propagation is pretty damn useful
so why are we complaining i mean i i

2668
00:42:16,470 --> 00:42:16,480
so why are we complaining i mean i i
 

2669
00:42:16,480 --> 00:42:17,750
so why are we complaining i mean i i
personally am a big fan of back

2670
00:42:17,750 --> 00:42:17,760
personally am a big fan of back
 

2671
00:42:17,760 --> 00:42:18,950
personally am a big fan of back
propagation i think it's a great

2672
00:42:18,950 --> 00:42:18,960
propagation i think it's a great
 

2673
00:42:18,960 --> 00:42:20,950
propagation i think it's a great
algorithm because it solves an extremely

2674
00:42:20,950 --> 00:42:20,960
algorithm because it solves an extremely
 

2675
00:42:20,960 --> 00:42:23,190
algorithm because it solves an extremely
fundamental problem which is

2676
00:42:23,190 --> 00:42:23,200
fundamental problem which is
 

2677
00:42:23,200 --> 00:42:26,309
fundamental problem which is
finding a neural circuit

2678
00:42:26,309 --> 00:42:26,319
finding a neural circuit
 

2679
00:42:26,319 --> 00:42:29,030
finding a neural circuit
subject to some constraints and i don't

2680
00:42:29,030 --> 00:42:29,040
subject to some constraints and i don't
 

2681
00:42:29,040 --> 00:42:30,710
subject to some constraints and i don't
see that problem going away so that's

2682
00:42:30,710 --> 00:42:30,720
see that problem going away so that's
 

2683
00:42:30,720 --> 00:42:32,309
see that problem going away so that's
why i

2684
00:42:32,309 --> 00:42:32,319
why i
 

2685
00:42:32,319 --> 00:42:34,870
why i
i really i think it's pretty unlikely

2686
00:42:34,870 --> 00:42:34,880
i really i think it's pretty unlikely
 

2687
00:42:34,880 --> 00:42:36,150
i really i think it's pretty unlikely
that we'll have anything which is going

2688
00:42:36,150 --> 00:42:36,160
that we'll have anything which is going
 

2689
00:42:36,160 --> 00:42:37,270
that we'll have anything which is going
to be

2690
00:42:37,270 --> 00:42:37,280
to be
 

2691
00:42:37,280 --> 00:42:39,750
to be
dramatically different it could happen

2692
00:42:39,750 --> 00:42:39,760
dramatically different it could happen
 

2693
00:42:39,760 --> 00:42:43,190
dramatically different it could happen
but i wouldn't bet on it right now

2694
00:42:43,190 --> 00:42:43,200
but i wouldn't bet on it right now
 

2695
00:42:43,200 --> 00:42:46,150
but i wouldn't bet on it right now
so let me ask a sort of big picture

2696
00:42:46,150 --> 00:42:46,160
so let me ask a sort of big picture
 

2697
00:42:46,160 --> 00:42:46,710
so let me ask a sort of big picture
question

2698
00:42:46,710 --> 00:42:46,720
question
 

2699
00:42:46,720 --> 00:42:49,349
question
do you think can do you think neural

2700
00:42:49,349 --> 00:42:49,359
do you think can do you think neural
 

2701
00:42:49,359 --> 00:42:51,589
do you think can do you think neural
networks can be made to reason

2702
00:42:51,589 --> 00:42:51,599
networks can be made to reason
 

2703
00:42:51,599 --> 00:42:54,870
networks can be made to reason
why not well if you look for example at

2704
00:42:54,870 --> 00:42:54,880
why not well if you look for example at
 

2705
00:42:54,880 --> 00:42:58,150
why not well if you look for example at
alphago or alpha zero

2706
00:42:58,150 --> 00:42:58,160
alphago or alpha zero
 

2707
00:42:58,160 --> 00:43:00,790
alphago or alpha zero
the neural network of alpha zero plays

00:43:00,790 --> 00:43:00,800
the neural network of alpha zero plays

doesn't that give us an existence proof

2722
00:43:14,950 --> 00:43:14,960
doesn't that give us an existence proof
 

2723
00:43:14,960 --> 00:43:17,670
doesn't that give us an existence proof
that neural networks can reason

that neural networks can reason
 

2725

a little bit maybe you disagree with

00:43:33,430 --> 00:43:33,440
a little bit maybe you disagree with
 

2739
00:43:33,440 --> 00:43:35,270
a little bit maybe you disagree with
that but

2740
00:43:35,270 --> 00:43:35,280
that but
 

2741
00:43:35,280 --> 00:43:37,109
that but
yes i think it has some of the same

00:43:37,109 --> 00:43:37,119
yes i think it has some of the same

00:43:38,480 --> 00:43:41,190
elements of
reasoning reasoning is almost like akin

reasoning reasoning is almost like akin
to search

2748
00:43:42,790 --> 00:43:42,800
to search
 

2749
00:43:42,800 --> 00:43:46,829
to search
right there's a sequential element of

2750
00:43:46,829 --> 00:43:46,839
right there's a sequential element of
 

2751
00:43:46,839 --> 00:43:51,430
right there's a sequential element of
stepwise consideration of possibilities

2752

stepwise consideration of possibilities
 

2753
00:43:51,440 --> 00:43:53,510
stepwise consideration of possibilities
and sort of building on top of those

00:43:53,510 --> 00:43:53,520
and sort of building on top of those
 

2755
00:43:53,520 --> 00:43:55,109

so yeah i guess playing go is kind of

2760
00:43:59,750 --> 00:43:59,760
so yeah i guess playing go is kind of
 

2761
00:43:59,760 --> 00:44:01,589
so yeah i guess playing go is kind of
like that and when you have a single

2762
00:44:01,589 --> 00:44:01,599
like that and when you have a single
 

2763
00:44:01,599 --> 00:44:03,910
like that and when you have a single
neural network doing that without search

2764
00:44:03,910 --> 00:44:03,920
neural network doing that without search
 

2765
00:44:03,920 --> 00:44:05,270
neural network doing that without search
that's kind of like that so there's an

2766
00:44:05,270 --> 00:44:05,280
that's kind of like that so there's an
 

2767
00:44:05,280 --> 00:44:06,630
that's kind of like that so there's an
existent proof in a particular

2768
00:44:06,630 --> 00:44:06,640
existent proof in a particular
 

2769

that a process akin to what
 

2773
00:44:11,440 --> 00:44:14,870
that a process akin to what
many people call reasoning exist but

2774
00:44:14,870 --> 00:44:14,880
many people call reasoning exist but
 

2775
00:44:14,880 --> 00:44:18,150
many people call reasoning exist but
more general kind of reasoning so off

2776
00:44:18,150 --> 00:44:18,160
more general kind of reasoning so off
 

2777
00:44:18,160 --> 00:44:20,309
more general kind of reasoning so off
the board there is one other existence

2778
00:44:20,309 --> 00:44:20,319
the board there is one other existence
 

2779
00:44:20,319 --> 00:44:22,069
the board there is one other existence
oh boy which one

2780
00:44:22,069 --> 00:44:22,079
oh boy which one
 

2781
00:44:22,079 --> 00:44:26,069
oh boy which one
us humans yes okay all right so

2782
00:44:26,069 --> 00:44:26,079
us humans yes okay all right so
 

2783
00:44:26,079 --> 00:44:29,829
us humans yes okay all right so
do you think the architecture

2784
00:44:29,829 --> 00:44:29,839
do you think the architecture
 

2785
00:44:29,839 --> 00:44:32,790
do you think the architecture
that will allow neural networks to

2786
00:44:32,790 --> 00:44:32,800
that will allow neural networks to
 

2787
00:44:32,800 --> 00:44:33,349
that will allow neural networks to
reason

2788
00:44:33,349 --> 00:44:33,359
reason
 

2789
00:44:33,359 --> 00:44:36,630
reason
will look similar to the neural network

2790
00:44:36,630 --> 00:44:36,640
will look similar to the neural network
 

2791
00:44:36,640 --> 00:44:38,710
will look similar to the neural network
architectures we have today

2792
00:44:38,710 --> 00:44:38,720
architectures we have today
 

2793
00:44:38,720 --> 00:44:40,710
architectures we have today
i think it will i think well i don't

2794
00:44:40,710 --> 00:44:40,720
i think it will i think well i don't
 

2795
00:44:40,720 --> 00:44:41,990
i think it will i think well i don't
want to make two

2796
00:44:41,990 --> 00:44:42,000
want to make two
 

2797
00:44:42,000 --> 00:44:44,309
want to make two
overly definitive statements i think

2798
00:44:44,309 --> 00:44:44,319
overly definitive statements i think
 

2799
00:44:44,319 --> 00:44:46,630
overly definitive statements i think
it's definitely possible that

2800
00:44:46,630 --> 00:44:46,640
it's definitely possible that
 

2801
00:44:46,640 --> 00:44:48,390
it's definitely possible that
the neural networks that will produce

2802
00:44:48,390 --> 00:44:48,400
the neural networks that will produce
 

2803
00:44:48,400 --> 00:44:49,670
the neural networks that will produce
the reasoning breakthroughs of the

2804
00:44:49,670 --> 00:44:49,680
the reasoning breakthroughs of the
 

2805
00:44:49,680 --> 00:44:50,950
the reasoning breakthroughs of the
future will be

2806
00:44:50,950 --> 00:44:50,960
future will be
 

2807
00:44:50,960 --> 00:44:52,550
future will be
very similar to the architectures that

2808
00:44:52,550 --> 00:44:52,560
very similar to the architectures that
 

2809
00:44:52,560 --> 00:44:54,230
very similar to the architectures that
exist today maybe

2810
00:44:54,230 --> 00:44:54,240
exist today maybe
 

2811
00:44:54,240 --> 00:44:55,670
exist today maybe
a little bit more current maybe a little

2812
00:44:55,670 --> 00:44:55,680
a little bit more current maybe a little
 

2813
00:44:55,680 --> 00:44:59,750
a little bit more current maybe a little
bit deeper but

2814
00:44:59,750 --> 00:44:59,760

 

2815
00:44:59,760 --> 00:45:01,510

but these these new lines are so

2816
00:45:01,510 --> 00:45:01,520
but these these new lines are so
 

2817
00:45:01,520 --> 00:45:02,790
but these these new lines are so
insanely powerful

2818
00:45:02,790 --> 00:45:02,800
insanely powerful
 

2819
00:45:02,800 --> 00:45:04,309
insanely powerful
why wouldn't they be able to learn to

2820
00:45:04,309 --> 00:45:04,319
why wouldn't they be able to learn to
 

2821
00:45:04,319 --> 00:45:07,109
why wouldn't they be able to learn to
reason humans can reason

2822
00:45:07,109 --> 00:45:07,119
reason humans can reason
 

2823
00:45:07,119 --> 00:45:09,510
reason humans can reason
so why can't neural networks so do you

2824
00:45:09,510 --> 00:45:09,520
so why can't neural networks so do you
 

2825
00:45:09,520 --> 00:45:11,510
so why can't neural networks so do you
think the kind of stuff we've seen

2826
00:45:11,510 --> 00:45:11,520
think the kind of stuff we've seen
 

2827
00:45:11,520 --> 00:45:13,430
think the kind of stuff we've seen
neural networks do is a kind of just

2828
00:45:13,430 --> 00:45:13,440
neural networks do is a kind of just
 

2829
00:45:13,440 --> 00:45:14,950
neural networks do is a kind of just
weak reasoning so it's not a

2830
00:45:14,950 --> 00:45:14,960
weak reasoning so it's not a
 

2831
00:45:14,960 --> 00:45:16,550
weak reasoning so it's not a
fundamentally different process

2832
00:45:16,550 --> 00:45:16,560
fundamentally different process
 

2833
00:45:16,560 --> 00:45:18,069
fundamentally different process
again this is stuff we don't nobody

2834
00:45:18,069 --> 00:45:18,079
again this is stuff we don't nobody
 

2835
00:45:18,079 --> 00:45:19,670
again this is stuff we don't nobody
knows the answer to

2836
00:45:19,670 --> 00:45:19,680
knows the answer to
 

2837
00:45:19,680 --> 00:45:22,470
knows the answer to
so when it comes to our neural networks

2838
00:45:22,470 --> 00:45:22,480
so when it comes to our neural networks
 

2839
00:45:22,480 --> 00:45:22,950
so when it comes to our neural networks
i would

2840
00:45:22,950 --> 00:45:22,960
i would
 

2841
00:45:22,960 --> 00:45:24,950
i would
think which i would say is that neural

2842
00:45:24,950 --> 00:45:24,960
think which i would say is that neural
 

2843
00:45:24,960 --> 00:45:28,230
think which i would say is that neural
networks are capable of reasoning

2844
00:45:28,230 --> 00:45:28,240
networks are capable of reasoning
 

2845
00:45:28,240 --> 00:45:30,150
networks are capable of reasoning
but if you train a neural network on a

2846
00:45:30,150 --> 00:45:30,160
but if you train a neural network on a
 

2847
00:45:30,160 --> 00:45:32,390
but if you train a neural network on a
task which doesn't require reasoning

2848
00:45:32,390 --> 00:45:32,400
task which doesn't require reasoning
 

2849
00:45:32,400 --> 00:45:34,309
task which doesn't require reasoning
it's not going to reason this is a

2850
00:45:34,309 --> 00:45:34,319
it's not going to reason this is a
 

2851
00:45:34,319 --> 00:45:35,829
it's not going to reason this is a
well-known effect where the neural

2852
00:45:35,829 --> 00:45:35,839
well-known effect where the neural
 

2853
00:45:35,839 --> 00:45:37,030
well-known effect where the neural
network will solve

2854
00:45:37,030 --> 00:45:37,040
network will solve
 

2855
00:45:37,040 --> 00:45:39,190
network will solve
exactly the it will solve the problem

2856
00:45:39,190 --> 00:45:39,200
exactly the it will solve the problem
 

2857
00:45:39,200 --> 00:45:41,270
exactly the it will solve the problem
that you pose in front of it

2858
00:45:41,270 --> 00:45:41,280
that you pose in front of it
 

2859
00:45:41,280 --> 00:45:44,390
that you pose in front of it
in the easiest way possible

2860
00:45:44,390 --> 00:45:44,400
in the easiest way possible
 

2861
00:45:44,400 --> 00:45:48,470
in the easiest way possible
right that takes us to the

2862
00:45:48,470 --> 00:45:48,480
right that takes us to the
 

2863
00:45:48,480 --> 00:45:51,589
right that takes us to the
to one of the brilliant sort of ways you

2864
00:45:51,589 --> 00:45:51,599
to one of the brilliant sort of ways you
 

2865
00:45:51,599 --> 00:45:54,069
to one of the brilliant sort of ways you
describe neural networks which is uh

2866
00:45:54,069 --> 00:45:54,079
describe neural networks which is uh
 

2867
00:45:54,079 --> 00:45:55,670
describe neural networks which is uh
you refer to neural networks as the

2868
00:45:55,670 --> 00:45:55,680
you refer to neural networks as the
 

2869
00:45:55,680 --> 00:45:57,910
you refer to neural networks as the
search for small circuits

2870
00:45:57,910 --> 00:45:57,920
search for small circuits
 

2871
00:45:57,920 --> 00:46:01,109
search for small circuits
and maybe general intelligence

2872
00:46:01,109 --> 00:46:01,119
and maybe general intelligence
 

2873
00:46:01,119 --> 00:46:04,390
and maybe general intelligence
as the search for small programs

2874
00:46:04,390 --> 00:46:04,400
as the search for small programs

00:46:04,400 --> 00:46:05,990
as the search for small programs
which i found is a metaphor very

2876
00:46:05,990 --> 00:46:06,000
which i found is a metaphor very
 

2877
00:46:06,000 --> 00:46:08,150
which i found is a metaphor very
compelling can you elaborate on that

2878
00:46:08,150 --> 00:46:08,160
compelling can you elaborate on that
 

2879
00:46:08,160 --> 00:46:09,190
compelling can you elaborate on that
difference

2880
00:46:09,190 --> 00:46:09,200
difference
 

2881
00:46:09,200 --> 00:46:12,390
difference
yeah so the thing which i said precisely

2882
00:46:12,390 --> 00:46:12,400
yeah so the thing which i said precisely
 

2883
00:46:12,400 --> 00:46:13,589
yeah so the thing which i said precisely
was that

2884
00:46:13,589 --> 00:46:13,599
was that
 

2885
00:46:13,599 --> 00:46:17,190
was that
if you can find the shortest program

2886
00:46:17,190 --> 00:46:17,200
if you can find the shortest program
 

2887
00:46:17,200 --> 00:46:19,510
if you can find the shortest program
that outputs the data in you at your

00:46:19,510 --> 00:46:19,520
that outputs the data in you at your

00:46:19,520 --> 00:46:20,870
that outputs the data in you at your

2891
00:46:20,880 --> 00:46:22,470

then you will be able to use it to make

2892
00:46:22,470 --> 00:46:22,480
then you will be able to use it to make
 

2893
00:46:22,480 --> 00:46:25,510
then you will be able to use it to make
the best prediction possible

2894
00:46:25,510 --> 00:46:25,520
the best prediction possible
 

2895
00:46:25,520 --> 00:46:27,030
the best prediction possible
and that's a theoretical statement which

2896
00:46:27,030 --> 00:46:27,040
and that's a theoretical statement which
 

2897
00:46:27,040 --> 00:46:29,190
and that's a theoretical statement which
can be proven mathematically

2898
00:46:29,190 --> 00:46:29,200
can be proven mathematically
 

2899
00:46:29,200 --> 00:46:31,109
can be proven mathematically
now you can also prove mathematically

2900
00:46:31,109 --> 00:46:31,119
now you can also prove mathematically
 

2901
00:46:31,119 --> 00:46:32,309
now you can also prove mathematically
that it is

00:46:32,309 --> 00:46:32,319
that it is
 

2903
00:46:32,319 --> 00:46:33,990
that it is
that finding the shortest program which

generates some data
 

2907
00:46:35,520 --> 00:46:39,030
generates some data
is not it's not a computable operation

2908
00:46:39,030 --> 00:46:39,040
is not it's not a computable operation
 

2909
00:46:39,040 --> 00:46:41,349
is not it's not a computable operation
no a finite amount of compute can do

this

this
so then with neural networks

2914
00:46:45,990 --> 00:46:46,000
so then with neural networks
 

2915
00:46:46,000 --> 00:46:47,829
so then with neural networks
neural networks are the next best stain

00:47:08,880 --> 00:47:11,190
circuit is the smallest
needed circuit well i see the thing the

2940
00:47:11,190 --> 00:47:11,200
needed circuit well i see the thing the
 

2941
00:47:11,200 --> 00:47:12,790
needed circuit well i see the thing the
thing which i would change now back back

2942
00:47:12,790 --> 00:47:12,800
thing which i would change now back back
 

2943
00:47:12,800 --> 00:47:14,069
thing which i would change now back back
then i really have i haven't fully

2944
00:47:14,069 --> 00:47:14,079
then i really have i haven't fully
 

2945
00:47:14,079 --> 00:47:15,589
then i really have i haven't fully
internalized the over parameter

2946
00:47:15,589 --> 00:47:15,599
internalized the over parameter
 

2947
00:47:15,599 --> 00:47:17,750
internalized the over parameter
the over parameterized results the the

2948
00:47:17,750 --> 00:47:17,760
the over parameterized results the the
 

2949
00:47:17,760 --> 00:47:19,270
the over parameterized results the the
things we know about over parameters

2950
00:47:19,270 --> 00:47:19,280
things we know about over parameters
 

2951
00:47:19,280 --> 00:47:20,470
things we know about over parameters
neural nets

2952
00:47:20,470 --> 00:47:20,480
neural nets
 

2953
00:47:20,480 --> 00:47:23,510
neural nets
now i would phrase it as a large circuit

2954
00:47:23,510 --> 00:47:23,520
now i would phrase it as a large circuit
 

2955
00:47:23,520 --> 00:47:25,670
now i would phrase it as a large circuit
that con whose weights contain a small

2956
00:47:25,670 --> 00:47:25,680
that con whose weights contain a small
 

2957
00:47:25,680 --> 00:47:27,589
that con whose weights contain a small
amount of information

2958
00:47:27,589 --> 00:47:27,599
amount of information
 

2959
00:47:27,599 --> 00:47:29,349
amount of information
which i think is what's going on if you

2960
00:47:29,349 --> 00:47:29,359
which i think is what's going on if you
 

2961
00:47:29,359 --> 00:47:31,109
which i think is what's going on if you
imagine the training process of a neural

2962
00:47:31,109 --> 00:47:31,119
imagine the training process of a neural
 

2963
00:47:31,119 --> 00:47:33,829
imagine the training process of a neural
network as you slowly transmit entropy

2964
00:47:33,829 --> 00:47:33,839
network as you slowly transmit entropy
 

2965
00:47:33,839 --> 00:47:36,950
network as you slowly transmit entropy
from the data set to the parameters

2966
00:47:36,950 --> 00:47:36,960
from the data set to the parameters
 

2967
00:47:36,960 --> 00:47:39,670
from the data set to the parameters
then somehow the amount of information

2968
00:47:39,670 --> 00:47:39,680
then somehow the amount of information
 

2969
00:47:39,680 --> 00:47:40,950
then somehow the amount of information
in the weights

2970
00:47:40,950 --> 00:47:40,960
in the weights
 

2971
00:47:40,960 --> 00:47:43,109
in the weights
ends up being not very large which would

2972
00:47:43,109 --> 00:47:43,119
ends up being not very large which would
 

2973
00:47:43,119 --> 00:47:45,190
ends up being not very large which would
explain why they generalized so well

2974
00:47:45,190 --> 00:47:45,200
explain why they generalized so well
 

2975
00:47:45,200 --> 00:47:47,190
explain why they generalized so well
so that's that the large circuit might

2976
00:47:47,190 --> 00:47:47,200
so that's that the large circuit might
 

2977
00:47:47,200 --> 00:47:48,870
so that's that the large circuit might
be one that's

2978
00:47:48,870 --> 00:47:48,880
be one that's
 

2979
00:47:48,880 --> 00:47:50,790
be one that's
helpful for the regulation for the

2980
00:47:50,790 --> 00:47:50,800
helpful for the regulation for the
 

2981
00:47:50,800 --> 00:47:54,710
helpful for the regulation for the
generalization yeah some of this

2982
00:47:54,710 --> 00:47:54,720

 

2983
00:47:54,720 --> 00:47:58,390

but do you see their

2984
00:47:58,390 --> 00:47:58,400
but do you see their
 

2985
00:47:58,400 --> 00:47:59,910
but do you see their
do you see it important to be able to

2986
00:47:59,910 --> 00:47:59,920
do you see it important to be able to
 

2987
00:47:59,920 --> 00:48:02,309
do you see it important to be able to
try to learn something like programs

2988
00:48:02,309 --> 00:48:02,319
try to learn something like programs
 

2989
00:48:02,319 --> 00:48:05,030
try to learn something like programs
i mean if you can definitely i think

2990
00:48:05,030 --> 00:48:05,040
i mean if you can definitely i think
 

2991
00:48:05,040 --> 00:48:06,710
i mean if you can definitely i think
it's kind of the answer is

2992
00:48:06,710 --> 00:48:06,720
it's kind of the answer is
 

2993
00:48:06,720 --> 00:48:09,430
it's kind of the answer is
kind of yes if we can do it we should do

2994
00:48:09,430 --> 00:48:09,440
kind of yes if we can do it we should do
 

2995
00:48:09,440 --> 00:48:11,109
kind of yes if we can do it we should do
things that we can do it

2996
00:48:11,109 --> 00:48:11,119
things that we can do it
 

2997
00:48:11,119 --> 00:48:13,190
things that we can do it
it's it's the reason we are pushing on

2998
00:48:13,190 --> 00:48:13,200
it's it's the reason we are pushing on
 

2999
00:48:13,200 --> 00:48:15,190
it's it's the reason we are pushing on
deep learning

3000
00:48:15,190 --> 00:48:15,200
deep learning
 

3001
00:48:15,200 --> 00:48:17,829
deep learning
the fundamental reason the cause the the

3002
00:48:17,829 --> 00:48:17,839
the fundamental reason the cause the the
 

3003
00:48:17,839 --> 00:48:18,710
the fundamental reason the cause the the
root cause

3004
00:48:18,710 --> 00:48:18,720
root cause
 

3005
00:48:18,720 --> 00:48:21,589
root cause
is that we are able to train them so in

3006
00:48:21,589 --> 00:48:21,599
is that we are able to train them so in
 

3007
00:48:21,599 --> 00:48:23,670
is that we are able to train them so in
other words training comes first

3008
00:48:23,670 --> 00:48:23,680
other words training comes first
 

3009
00:48:23,680 --> 00:48:25,910
other words training comes first
we've got our pillar which is the

3010
00:48:25,910 --> 00:48:25,920
we've got our pillar which is the
 

3011
00:48:25,920 --> 00:48:27,430
we've got our pillar which is the
training pillar

3012
00:48:27,430 --> 00:48:27,440
training pillar
 

3013
00:48:27,440 --> 00:48:29,270
training pillar
and now we are trying to contort our

3014
00:48:29,270 --> 00:48:29,280
and now we are trying to contort our
 

3015
00:48:29,280 --> 00:48:30,470
and now we are trying to contort our
neural networks around the training

3016
00:48:30,470 --> 00:48:30,480
neural networks around the training
 

3017
00:48:30,480 --> 00:48:32,230
neural networks around the training
pillar we got to stay trainable this is

3018
00:48:32,230 --> 00:48:32,240
pillar we got to stay trainable this is
 

3019
00:48:32,240 --> 00:48:32,630
pillar we got to stay trainable this is
an

3020
00:48:32,630 --> 00:48:32,640
an
 

3021
00:48:32,640 --> 00:48:35,109
an
invo this is an invariant we cannot

3022
00:48:35,109 --> 00:48:35,119
invo this is an invariant we cannot
 

3023
00:48:35,119 --> 00:48:36,309
invo this is an invariant we cannot
violate

3024
00:48:36,309 --> 00:48:36,319
violate
 

3025
00:48:36,319 --> 00:48:39,510
violate
and so being trainable means

3026
00:48:39,510 --> 00:48:39,520
and so being trainable means
 

3027
00:48:39,520 --> 00:48:41,109
and so being trainable means
starting from scratch knowing nothing

3028
00:48:41,109 --> 00:48:41,119
starting from scratch knowing nothing
 

3029
00:48:41,119 --> 00:48:43,270
starting from scratch knowing nothing
you can actually pretty quickly converge

3030
00:48:43,270 --> 00:48:43,280
you can actually pretty quickly converge
 

3031
00:48:43,280 --> 00:48:44,470
you can actually pretty quickly converge
towards knowing a lot

3032
00:48:44,470 --> 00:48:44,480
towards knowing a lot
 

3033
00:48:44,480 --> 00:48:47,349
towards knowing a lot
or even slowly but it means that given

3034
00:48:47,349 --> 00:48:47,359
or even slowly but it means that given
 

3035
00:48:47,359 --> 00:48:50,630
or even slowly but it means that given
the resources at your disposal

3036
00:48:50,630 --> 00:48:50,640
the resources at your disposal
 

3037
00:48:50,640 --> 00:48:52,790
the resources at your disposal
you can train the neural net and get it

3038
00:48:52,790 --> 00:48:52,800
you can train the neural net and get it
 

3039
00:48:52,800 --> 00:48:54,230
you can train the neural net and get it
to achieve

3040
00:48:54,230 --> 00:48:54,240
to achieve
 

3041
00:48:54,240 --> 00:48:56,309
to achieve
useful performance yeah that's a pillar

3042
00:48:56,309 --> 00:48:56,319
useful performance yeah that's a pillar
 

3043
00:48:56,319 --> 00:48:57,750
useful performance yeah that's a pillar
we can't move away from that's right

3044
00:48:57,750 --> 00:48:57,760
we can't move away from that's right
 

3045
00:48:57,760 --> 00:48:59,349
we can't move away from that's right
because if you can whereas if you say

3046
00:48:59,349 --> 00:48:59,359
because if you can whereas if you say
 

3047
00:48:59,359 --> 00:49:01,270
because if you can whereas if you say
hey let's find the shortest program

3048
00:49:01,270 --> 00:49:01,280
hey let's find the shortest program
 

3049
00:49:01,280 --> 00:49:03,190
hey let's find the shortest program
but we can't do that so it doesn't

3050
00:49:03,190 --> 00:49:03,200
but we can't do that so it doesn't
 

3051
00:49:03,200 --> 00:49:04,309
but we can't do that so it doesn't
matter how useful

3052
00:49:04,309 --> 00:49:04,319
matter how useful
 

3053
00:49:04,319 --> 00:49:08,309
matter how useful
that would be we can't do it so we want

3054
00:49:08,309 --> 00:49:08,319
that would be we can't do it so we want
 

3055
00:49:08,319 --> 00:49:09,670
that would be we can't do it so we want
so do you think you kind of mentioned

3056
00:49:09,670 --> 00:49:09,680
so do you think you kind of mentioned
 

3057
00:49:09,680 --> 00:49:10,950
so do you think you kind of mentioned
that the neural networks are good at

3058
00:49:10,950 --> 00:49:10,960
that the neural networks are good at
 

3059
00:49:10,960 --> 00:49:14,309
that the neural networks are good at
finding small circuits or large circuits

3060
00:49:14,309 --> 00:49:14,319
finding small circuits or large circuits
 

3061
00:49:14,319 --> 00:49:16,069
finding small circuits or large circuits
do you think then the matter of finding

3062
00:49:16,069 --> 00:49:16,079
do you think then the matter of finding
 

3063
00:49:16,079 --> 00:49:17,510
do you think then the matter of finding
small programs

3064
00:49:17,510 --> 00:49:17,520
small programs
 

3065
00:49:17,520 --> 00:49:20,790
small programs
is just the data no so

3066
00:49:20,790 --> 00:49:20,800
is just the data no so
 

3067
00:49:20,800 --> 00:49:23,750
is just the data no so
the sorry not not the size or character

3068
00:49:23,750 --> 00:49:23,760
the sorry not not the size or character
 

3069
00:49:23,760 --> 00:49:24,390
the sorry not not the size or character
the qual

3070
00:49:24,390 --> 00:49:24,400
the qual
 

3071
00:49:24,400 --> 00:49:27,589
the qual
the the type of data sort of ask giving

3072
00:49:27,589 --> 00:49:27,599
the the type of data sort of ask giving
 

3073
00:49:27,599 --> 00:49:28,870
the the type of data sort of ask giving
it programs

3074
00:49:28,870 --> 00:49:28,880
it programs
 

3075
00:49:28,880 --> 00:49:31,990
it programs
well i think the thing is that right now

3076
00:49:31,990 --> 00:49:32,000
well i think the thing is that right now
 

3077
00:49:32,000 --> 00:49:34,549
well i think the thing is that right now
finding there are no good precedence of

3078
00:49:34,549 --> 00:49:34,559
finding there are no good precedence of
 

3079
00:49:34,559 --> 00:49:37,030
finding there are no good precedence of
people successfully finding

3080
00:49:37,030 --> 00:49:37,040
people successfully finding
 

3081
00:49:37,040 --> 00:49:39,510
people successfully finding
programs really well and so the way

3082
00:49:39,510 --> 00:49:39,520
programs really well and so the way
 

3083
00:49:39,520 --> 00:49:41,510
programs really well and so the way
you'd find programs is you'd

3084
00:49:41,510 --> 00:49:41,520
you'd find programs is you'd
 

3085
00:49:41,520 --> 00:49:43,030
you'd find programs is you'd
train a deep neural network to do it

3086
00:49:43,030 --> 00:49:43,040
train a deep neural network to do it
 

3087
00:49:43,040 --> 00:49:45,750
train a deep neural network to do it
basically right

3088
00:49:45,750 --> 00:49:45,760
basically right
 

3089
00:49:45,760 --> 00:49:47,109
basically right
which is which is the right way to go

3090
00:49:47,109 --> 00:49:47,119
which is which is the right way to go
 

3091
00:49:47,119 --> 00:49:49,030
which is which is the right way to go
about it but there's not good

3092
00:49:49,030 --> 00:49:49,040
about it but there's not good
 

3093
00:49:49,040 --> 00:49:51,270
about it but there's not good
uh illustrations that it has hasn't been

3094
00:49:51,270 --> 00:49:51,280
uh illustrations that it has hasn't been
 

3095
00:49:51,280 --> 00:49:52,549
uh illustrations that it has hasn't been
done yet but

3096
00:49:52,549 --> 00:49:52,559
done yet but
 

3097
00:49:52,559 --> 00:49:56,390
done yet but
in principle it should be possible

3098
00:49:56,390 --> 00:49:56,400

 

3099
00:49:56,400 --> 00:49:58,069

can you elaborate in a little bit you

3100
00:49:58,069 --> 00:49:58,079
can you elaborate in a little bit you
 

3101
00:49:58,079 --> 00:49:59,829
can you elaborate in a little bit you
what's your insight in principle

3102
00:49:59,829 --> 00:49:59,839
what's your insight in principle
 

3103
00:49:59,839 --> 00:50:02,470
what's your insight in principle
and put another way you don't see why

3104
00:50:02,470 --> 00:50:02,480
and put another way you don't see why

it's not

3106
00:50:03,109 --> 00:50:03,119
it's not
 

3107
00:50:03,119 --> 00:50:06,150
it's not
possible well it's kind of like more

3108
00:50:06,150 --> 00:50:06,160
possible well it's kind of like more
 

3109
00:50:06,160 --> 00:50:09,349
possible well it's kind of like more
it's more a statement of

00:50:09,349 --> 00:50:09,359
it's more a statement of
 

3111
00:50:09,359 --> 00:50:11,430
it's more a statement of
i think that it's i think that it's

i think that it's i think that it's
 

3113
00:50:11,440 --> 00:50:14,870
i think that it's i think that it's
unwise to bet against deep learning and

3114
00:50:14,870 --> 00:50:14,880
unwise to bet against deep learning and
 

3115
00:50:14,880 --> 00:50:16,790
unwise to bet against deep learning and
if it's a if it's a cognitive function

00:50:16,790 --> 00:50:16,800
if it's a if it's a cognitive function
 

3117
00:50:16,800 --> 00:50:18,630
if it's a if it's a cognitive function
that humans seem to be able to do

that humans seem to be able to do
 

3119
00:50:18,640 --> 00:50:22,150
that humans seem to be able to do
then it doesn't take too long for

3120
00:50:22,150 --> 00:50:22,160
then it doesn't take too long for
 

3121
00:50:22,160 --> 00:50:23,910
then it doesn't take too long for
some deep neural net to pop up that can

3122
00:50:23,910 --> 00:50:23,920
some deep neural net to pop up that can
 

3123
00:50:23,920 --> 00:50:25,670
some deep neural net to pop up that can
do it too

3124
00:50:25,670 --> 00:50:25,680
do it too
 

3125
00:50:25,680 --> 00:50:28,150
do it too
yeah i'm i'm i'm there with you i can

i've
 

3129
00:50:28,720 --> 00:50:31,430
i've
i've stopped betting against neural

00:50:37,510 --> 00:50:37,520
what about long-term memory can neural
 

3139
00:50:37,520 --> 00:50:38,950
what about long-term memory can neural
networks have long-term memory or

networks have long-term memory or
 

3141
00:50:38,960 --> 00:50:41,190
networks have long-term memory or
something like

3142
00:50:41,190 --> 00:50:41,200
something like
 

3143
00:50:41,200 --> 00:50:43,829
something like
knowledge bases so being able to

00:50:43,829 --> 00:50:43,839
knowledge bases so being able to
 

3145

so in some sense the parameters already

3162
00:51:03,990 --> 00:51:04,000
so in some sense the parameters already
 

3163
00:51:04,000 --> 00:51:05,829
so in some sense the parameters already
do that

there is work there is work there yeah
 

3187
00:51:27,359 --> 00:51:28,470
there is work there is work there yeah
but in some sense

3188
00:51:28,470 --> 00:51:28,480
but in some sense
 

3189
00:51:28,480 --> 00:51:30,150
but in some sense
do you think in every sense do you think

3190
00:51:30,150 --> 00:51:30,160
do you think in every sense do you think
 

3191
00:51:30,160 --> 00:51:32,390
do you think in every sense do you think
there's a

there's a
 

3193
00:51:32,400 --> 00:51:35,510
there's a
it's it's all just a a matter of coming

it's it's all just a a matter of coming
 

3195

it's it's all just a a matter of coming
up with a better mechanism of forgetting

up with a better mechanism of forgetting

the useless stuff
 

3199
00:51:38,319 --> 00:51:40,309
the useless stuff
and remembering the useful stuff because

3200
00:51:40,309 --> 00:51:40,319
and remembering the useful stuff because
 

3201
00:51:40,319 --> 00:51:42,150
and remembering the useful stuff because
right now i mean there's not

3202
00:51:42,150 --> 00:51:42,160
right now i mean there's not
 

3203
00:51:42,160 --> 00:51:45,190
right now i mean there's not
been mechanisms that do remember really

3204
00:51:45,190 --> 00:51:45,200
been mechanisms that do remember really
 

3205

long-term information
 

3207
00:51:46,720 --> 00:51:49,750
long-term information
what do you mean by that precisely

3208
00:51:49,750 --> 00:51:49,760
what do you mean by that precisely
 

3209
00:51:49,760 --> 00:51:54,630
what do you mean by that precisely
i like i like the word precisely so

3210
00:51:54,630 --> 00:51:54,640

 

3211
00:51:54,640 --> 00:51:57,190

i'm thinking of the kind of compression

3212
00:51:57,190 --> 00:51:57,200
i'm thinking of the kind of compression
 

3213
00:51:57,200 --> 00:51:59,190
i'm thinking of the kind of compression
of information the knowledge bases

3214
00:51:59,190 --> 00:51:59,200
of information the knowledge bases
 

3215
00:51:59,200 --> 00:52:00,390
of information the knowledge bases
represent

3216
00:52:00,390 --> 00:52:00,400
represent
 

3217
00:52:00,400 --> 00:52:03,670

now i apologize for my sort of

3220
00:52:05,670 --> 00:52:05,680
now i apologize for my sort of
 

3221
00:52:05,680 --> 00:52:07,670
now i apologize for my sort of
human-centric thinking about

3222
00:52:07,670 --> 00:52:07,680
human-centric thinking about
 

3223
00:52:07,680 --> 00:52:09,589
human-centric thinking about
what knowledge is because neural

3224
00:52:09,589 --> 00:52:09,599
what knowledge is because neural
 

3225
00:52:09,599 --> 00:52:11,109
what knowledge is because neural
networks aren't

3226
00:52:11,109 --> 00:52:11,119
networks aren't
 

3227
00:52:11,119 --> 00:52:13,270
networks aren't
interpretable necessarily with the kind

3228
00:52:13,270 --> 00:52:13,280
interpretable necessarily with the kind
 

3229
00:52:13,280 --> 00:52:15,670
interpretable necessarily with the kind
of knowledge they have discovered

3230
00:52:15,670 --> 00:52:15,680
of knowledge they have discovered
 

3231
00:52:15,680 --> 00:52:18,230
of knowledge they have discovered
but a good example for me is knowledge

3232
00:52:18,230 --> 00:52:18,240
but a good example for me is knowledge
 

3233
00:52:18,240 --> 00:52:20,230
but a good example for me is knowledge
bases being able to build up over time

3234
00:52:20,230 --> 00:52:20,240
bases being able to build up over time
 

3235
00:52:20,240 --> 00:52:21,190
bases being able to build up over time
something like

3236
00:52:21,190 --> 00:52:21,200
something like
 

3237
00:52:21,200 --> 00:52:23,910
something like
the knowledge that wikipedia represents

3238
00:52:23,910 --> 00:52:23,920
the knowledge that wikipedia represents
 

3239
00:52:23,920 --> 00:52:25,829
the knowledge that wikipedia represents
it's a really compressed

3240
00:52:25,829 --> 00:52:25,839
it's a really compressed
 

3241
00:52:25,839 --> 00:52:29,750
it's a really compressed
structured

3242
00:52:29,750 --> 00:52:29,760

 

3243
00:52:29,760 --> 00:52:31,990

knowledge base obviously not the actual

3244
00:52:31,990 --> 00:52:32,000
knowledge base obviously not the actual
 

3245
00:52:32,000 --> 00:52:34,230
knowledge base obviously not the actual
wikipedia or the language

3246
00:52:34,230 --> 00:52:34,240
wikipedia or the language
 

3247
00:52:34,240 --> 00:52:36,230
wikipedia or the language
but like a semantic web the dream that

3248
00:52:36,230 --> 00:52:36,240
but like a semantic web the dream that
 

3249
00:52:36,240 --> 00:52:37,750
but like a semantic web the dream that
semantic web represented

3250
00:52:37,750 --> 00:52:37,760
semantic web represented
 

3251
00:52:37,760 --> 00:52:39,190
semantic web represented
so it's a really nice compressed

3252
00:52:39,190 --> 00:52:39,200
so it's a really nice compressed
 

3253
00:52:39,200 --> 00:52:41,190
so it's a really nice compressed
knowledge base or something

3254
00:52:41,190 --> 00:52:41,200
knowledge base or something
 

3255
00:52:41,200 --> 00:52:44,069
knowledge base or something
akin to that in the non-interpretable

3256
00:52:44,069 --> 00:52:44,079
akin to that in the non-interpretable
 

3257
00:52:44,079 --> 00:52:45,430
akin to that in the non-interpretable
sense as

3259
00:52:45,440 --> 00:52:47,030

non-interpretable if you look at their

3264
00:52:48,950 --> 00:52:48,960
non-interpretable if you look at their
 

3265
00:52:48,960 --> 00:52:50,150
non-interpretable if you look at their
weights but

3266
00:52:50,150 --> 00:52:50,160
weights but
 

3267
00:52:50,160 --> 00:52:51,190
weights but
their outputs should be very

3268
00:52:51,190 --> 00:52:51,200
their outputs should be very
 

3269
00:52:51,200 --> 00:52:53,349
their outputs should be very
interpretable okay so yeah how do

3270
00:52:53,349 --> 00:52:53,359
interpretable okay so yeah how do
 

3271
00:52:53,359 --> 00:52:55,910
interpretable okay so yeah how do
you make very smart neural networks like

3272
00:52:55,910 --> 00:52:55,920
you make very smart neural networks like
 

3273
00:52:55,920 --> 00:52:57,990
you make very smart neural networks like
language models interpretable

3274
00:52:57,990 --> 00:52:58,000
language models interpretable
 

3275
00:52:58,000 --> 00:53:00,069
language models interpretable
well you ask them to generate some text

3276
00:53:00,069 --> 00:53:00,079
well you ask them to generate some text
 

3277
00:53:00,079 --> 00:53:01,190
well you ask them to generate some text
then the text will generally be

3278
00:53:01,190 --> 00:53:01,200
then the text will generally be
 

3279
00:53:01,200 --> 00:53:01,990
then the text will generally be
interpretable

3280
00:53:01,990 --> 00:53:02,000
interpretable
 

3281
00:53:02,000 --> 00:53:03,589
interpretable
do you find that the epitome of

3282
00:53:03,589 --> 00:53:03,599
do you find that the epitome of
 

3283
00:53:03,599 --> 00:53:05,030
do you find that the epitome of
interpretability like

3284
00:53:05,030 --> 00:53:05,040
interpretability like
 

3285
00:53:05,040 --> 00:53:07,589
interpretability like
can you do better like can you uh

3286
00:53:07,589 --> 00:53:07,599
can you do better like can you uh
 

3287
00:53:07,599 --> 00:53:09,430
can you do better like can you uh
because you can't okay i'd like to know

3288
00:53:09,430 --> 00:53:09,440
because you can't okay i'd like to know
 

3289
00:53:09,440 --> 00:53:12,069
because you can't okay i'd like to know
what does it know and what doesn't know

3290
00:53:12,069 --> 00:53:12,079
what does it know and what doesn't know
 

3291
00:53:12,079 --> 00:53:12,950
what does it know and what doesn't know
i would like

3292
00:53:12,950 --> 00:53:12,960
i would like
 

3293
00:53:12,960 --> 00:53:14,390
i would like
the neural network to come up with

3294
00:53:14,390 --> 00:53:14,400
the neural network to come up with
 

3295
00:53:14,400 --> 00:53:16,230
the neural network to come up with
examples where it

3296
00:53:16,230 --> 00:53:16,240
examples where it
 

3297
00:53:16,240 --> 00:53:18,710
examples where it
it's completely dumb and examples where

3298
00:53:18,710 --> 00:53:18,720
it's completely dumb and examples where
 

3299
00:53:18,720 --> 00:53:20,230
it's completely dumb and examples where
it's completely brilliant

3300
00:53:20,230 --> 00:53:20,240
it's completely brilliant
 

3301
00:53:20,240 --> 00:53:21,910
it's completely brilliant
and the only way i know how to do that

3302
00:53:21,910 --> 00:53:21,920
and the only way i know how to do that
 

3303
00:53:21,920 --> 00:53:24,549
and the only way i know how to do that
now is to generate a lot of examples and

3304
00:53:24,549 --> 00:53:24,559
now is to generate a lot of examples and
 

3305
00:53:24,559 --> 00:53:26,390
now is to generate a lot of examples and
use my human judgment

3306
00:53:26,390 --> 00:53:26,400
use my human judgment
 

3307
00:53:26,400 --> 00:53:28,309
use my human judgment
but it would be nice if a neonatal had

3308
00:53:28,309 --> 00:53:28,319
but it would be nice if a neonatal had
 

3309
00:53:28,319 --> 00:53:30,790
but it would be nice if a neonatal had
some aware self-awareness

3310
00:53:30,790 --> 00:53:30,800
some aware self-awareness
 

3311
00:53:30,800 --> 00:53:34,069
some aware self-awareness
about it yeah 100 i'm a big believer in

3312
00:53:34,069 --> 00:53:34,079
about it yeah 100 i'm a big believer in
 

3313
00:53:34,079 --> 00:53:36,230
about it yeah 100 i'm a big believer in
self-awareness and i think that

3314
00:53:36,230 --> 00:53:36,240
self-awareness and i think that
 

3315
00:53:36,240 --> 00:53:39,190
self-awareness and i think that
i think i think neural net

3316
00:53:39,190 --> 00:53:39,200
i think i think neural net
 

3317
00:53:39,200 --> 00:53:40,870
i think i think neural net
self-awareness will allow for things

3318
00:53:40,870 --> 00:53:40,880
self-awareness will allow for things
 

3319
00:53:40,880 --> 00:53:41,750
self-awareness will allow for things
like

3320
00:53:41,750 --> 00:53:41,760
like
 

3321
00:53:41,760 --> 00:53:43,030
like
the capabilities like the ones you

3322
00:53:43,030 --> 00:53:43,040
the capabilities like the ones you
 

3323
00:53:43,040 --> 00:53:45,109
the capabilities like the ones you
describe like for them to know what they

3324
00:53:45,109 --> 00:53:45,119
describe like for them to know what they
 

3325
00:53:45,119 --> 00:53:46,870
describe like for them to know what they
know and what they don't know

3326
00:53:46,870 --> 00:53:46,880
know and what they don't know
 

3327
00:53:46,880 --> 00:53:48,710
know and what they don't know
and for them to know where to invest to

3328
00:53:48,710 --> 00:53:48,720
and for them to know where to invest to
 

3329
00:53:48,720 --> 00:53:50,790
and for them to know where to invest to
increase their skills most optimally

3330
00:53:50,790 --> 00:53:50,800
increase their skills most optimally
 

3331
00:53:50,800 --> 00:53:52,150
increase their skills most optimally
and to your question of interpretability

3332
00:53:52,150 --> 00:53:52,160
and to your question of interpretability
 

3333
00:53:52,160 --> 00:53:53,510
and to your question of interpretability
there are actually two answers to that

3334
00:53:53,510 --> 00:53:53,520
there are actually two answers to that
 

3335
00:53:53,520 --> 00:53:54,230
there are actually two answers to that
question

3336
00:53:54,230 --> 00:53:54,240
question
 

3337
00:53:54,240 --> 00:53:55,829
question
one answer is you know we have the

3338
00:53:55,829 --> 00:53:55,839
one answer is you know we have the
 

3339
00:53:55,839 --> 00:53:57,349
one answer is you know we have the
neural net so we can

3340
00:53:57,349 --> 00:53:57,359
neural net so we can
 

3341
00:53:57,359 --> 00:53:59,030
neural net so we can
analyze the neurons and we can try to

3342
00:53:59,030 --> 00:53:59,040
analyze the neurons and we can try to
 

3343
00:53:59,040 --> 00:54:00,470
analyze the neurons and we can try to
understand what the different neurons

3344
00:54:00,470 --> 00:54:00,480
understand what the different neurons
 

3345
00:54:00,480 --> 00:54:01,829
understand what the different neurons
and different layers mean

3346
00:54:01,829 --> 00:54:01,839
and different layers mean
 

3347
00:54:01,839 --> 00:54:03,990
and different layers mean
and you can actually do that and openai

3348
00:54:03,990 --> 00:54:04,000
and you can actually do that and openai
 

3349
00:54:04,000 --> 00:54:05,750
and you can actually do that and openai
has done some work on that

3350
00:54:05,750 --> 00:54:05,760
has done some work on that
 

3351
00:54:05,760 --> 00:54:08,829
has done some work on that
but there is a different answer which is

3352
00:54:08,829 --> 00:54:08,839
but there is a different answer which is
 

3353
00:54:08,839 --> 00:54:10,390
but there is a different answer which is
that i would say this is the

3354
00:54:10,390 --> 00:54:10,400
that i would say this is the
 

3355
00:54:10,400 --> 00:54:13,030
that i would say this is the
human-centric answer where you say

3356
00:54:13,030 --> 00:54:13,040
human-centric answer where you say
 

3357
00:54:13,040 --> 00:54:15,030
human-centric answer where you say
you know you look at a human being you

3358
00:54:15,030 --> 00:54:15,040
you know you look at a human being you
 

3359
00:54:15,040 --> 00:54:16,710
you know you look at a human being you
can't read you know

3360
00:54:16,710 --> 00:54:16,720
can't read you know
 

3361
00:54:16,720 --> 00:54:18,309
can't read you know
how how do you know what a human being

3362
00:54:18,309 --> 00:54:18,319
how how do you know what a human being
 

3363
00:54:18,319 --> 00:54:19,589
how how do you know what a human being
is think and you ask them you say hey

3364
00:54:19,589 --> 00:54:19,599
is think and you ask them you say hey
 

3365
00:54:19,599 --> 00:54:20,630
is think and you ask them you say hey
what do you think about this what do you

3366
00:54:20,630 --> 00:54:20,640
what do you think about this what do you
 

3367
00:54:20,640 --> 00:54:22,150
what do you think about this what do you
think about that

3368
00:54:22,150 --> 00:54:22,160
think about that
 

3369
00:54:22,160 --> 00:54:24,790
think about that
and you get some answers the answers you

3370
00:54:24,790 --> 00:54:24,800
and you get some answers the answers you
 

3371
00:54:24,800 --> 00:54:26,390
and you get some answers the answers you
get are sticky in the sense you already

3372
00:54:26,390 --> 00:54:26,400
get are sticky in the sense you already
 

3373
00:54:26,400 --> 00:54:27,829
get are sticky in the sense you already
have a mental model

3374
00:54:27,829 --> 00:54:27,839
have a mental model
 

3375
00:54:27,839 --> 00:54:30,950
have a mental model
you already have an uh yeah mental model

3376
00:54:30,950 --> 00:54:30,960
you already have an uh yeah mental model
 

3377
00:54:30,960 --> 00:54:32,549
you already have an uh yeah mental model
of that human being

3378
00:54:32,549 --> 00:54:32,559
of that human being
 

3379
00:54:32,559 --> 00:54:35,030
of that human being
you already have an understanding of

3380
00:54:35,030 --> 00:54:35,040
you already have an understanding of
 

3381
00:54:35,040 --> 00:54:36,069
you already have an understanding of
like a

3382
00:54:36,069 --> 00:54:36,079
like a
 

3383
00:54:36,079 --> 00:54:38,069
like a
a big conception of what it of that

3384
00:54:38,069 --> 00:54:38,079
a big conception of what it of that
 

3385
00:54:38,079 --> 00:54:39,349
a big conception of what it of that
human being how they think

3386
00:54:39,349 --> 00:54:39,359
human being how they think
 

3387
00:54:39,359 --> 00:54:41,430
human being how they think
what they know how they see the world

3388
00:54:41,430 --> 00:54:41,440
what they know how they see the world
 

3389
00:54:41,440 --> 00:54:43,430
what they know how they see the world
and then everything you ask you're

3390
00:54:43,430 --> 00:54:43,440
and then everything you ask you're
 

3391
00:54:43,440 --> 00:54:47,510
and then everything you ask you're
adding on to that and that stickiness

3392
00:54:47,510 --> 00:54:47,520
adding on to that and that stickiness
 

3393
00:54:47,520 --> 00:54:50,710
adding on to that and that stickiness
seems to be that's one of the really

3394
00:54:50,710 --> 00:54:50,720
seems to be that's one of the really
 

3395
00:54:50,720 --> 00:54:52,390
seems to be that's one of the really
interesting qualities of the the human

3396
00:54:52,390 --> 00:54:52,400
interesting qualities of the the human
 

3397
00:54:52,400 --> 00:54:54,870
interesting qualities of the the human
being is that information is sticky

3398
00:54:54,870 --> 00:54:54,880
being is that information is sticky
 

3399
00:54:54,880 --> 00:54:56,710
being is that information is sticky
you don't you seem to remember the

3400
00:54:56,710 --> 00:54:56,720
you don't you seem to remember the
 

3401
00:54:56,720 --> 00:54:58,470
you don't you seem to remember the
useful stuff aggregate it well

3402
00:54:58,470 --> 00:54:58,480
useful stuff aggregate it well
 

3403
00:54:58,480 --> 00:55:00,309
useful stuff aggregate it well
and forget most of the information

3404
00:55:00,309 --> 00:55:00,319
and forget most of the information
 

3405
00:55:00,319 --> 00:55:01,910
and forget most of the information
that's not useful

3406
00:55:01,910 --> 00:55:01,920
that's not useful
 

3407
00:55:01,920 --> 00:55:04,470
that's not useful
that process but that's also pretty

3408
00:55:04,470 --> 00:55:04,480
that process but that's also pretty
 

3409
00:55:04,480 --> 00:55:05,750
that process but that's also pretty
similar to the process that neural

3410
00:55:05,750 --> 00:55:05,760
similar to the process that neural
 

3411
00:55:05,760 --> 00:55:06,630
similar to the process that neural
networks do

3412
00:55:06,630 --> 00:55:06,640
networks do
 

3413
00:55:06,640 --> 00:55:08,230
networks do
is just that neural network so much

3414
00:55:08,230 --> 00:55:08,240
is just that neural network so much
 

3415
00:55:08,240 --> 00:55:10,470
is just that neural network so much
crappier at it at this time

3416
00:55:10,470 --> 00:55:10,480
crappier at it at this time
 

3417
00:55:10,480 --> 00:55:12,309
crappier at it at this time
it doesn't seem to be fundamentally that

3418
00:55:12,309 --> 00:55:12,319
it doesn't seem to be fundamentally that
 

3419
00:55:12,319 --> 00:55:13,589
it doesn't seem to be fundamentally that
different but

3420
00:55:13,589 --> 00:55:13,599
different but
 

3421
00:55:13,599 --> 00:55:15,190
different but
just to stick on reasoning for a little

3422
00:55:15,190 --> 00:55:15,200
just to stick on reasoning for a little
 

3423
00:55:15,200 --> 00:55:17,190
just to stick on reasoning for a little

00:55:50,789 --> 00:55:50,799
yeah i think though those ones are a
 

3453
00:55:50,799 --> 00:55:52,549
yeah i think though those ones are a
very natural example as well

very natural example as well
 

3455
00:55:52,559 --> 00:55:54,069

00:55:54,069 --> 00:55:54,079
you know if you can prove an unproven
 

3457
00:55:54,079 --> 00:55:55,910
you know if you can prove an unproven

and so by the way and this comes back to

3462
00:55:58,950 --> 00:55:58,960
and so by the way and this comes back to
 

3463
00:55:58,960 --> 00:56:00,470
and so by the way and this comes back to
the point about the hard results you

3464
00:56:00,470 --> 00:56:00,480
the point about the hard results you
 

3465
00:56:00,480 --> 00:56:00,870
the point about the hard results you
know

3466
00:56:00,870 --> 00:56:00,880

00:56:05,520 --> 00:56:07,670
deep learning as a field is very
fortunate because we have the ability to

3481
00:56:12,640 --> 00:56:14,309

00:56:21,030 --> 00:56:21,040
conversation and then of course just
 

3491
00:56:21,040 --> 00:56:22,470
conversation and then of course just
like you said people kind of take that

3492
00:56:22,470 --> 00:56:22,480
like you said people kind of take that
 

3493
00:56:22,480 --> 00:56:23,829
like you said people kind of take that
for granted and say that wasn't actually

3494
00:56:23,829 --> 00:56:23,839
for granted and say that wasn't actually
 

3495
00:56:23,839 --> 00:56:24,950

a hard problem

3496
00:56:24,950 --> 00:56:24,960
a hard problem
 

3497
00:56:24,960 --> 00:56:26,630
a hard problem
well i mean at some point we'll probably

3498
00:56:26,630 --> 00:56:26,640
well i mean at some point we'll probably
 

3499
00:56:26,640 --> 00:56:29,349
well i mean at some point we'll probably
run out of heart problems

3500
00:56:29,349 --> 00:56:29,359
run out of heart problems
 

3501
00:56:29,359 --> 00:56:31,750
run out of heart problems
yeah that whole mortality thing is kind

3502
00:56:31,750 --> 00:56:31,760
yeah that whole mortality thing is kind
 

3503
00:56:31,760 --> 00:56:32,470
yeah that whole mortality thing is kind
of

3504
00:56:32,470 --> 00:56:32,480
of
 

3505
00:56:32,480 --> 00:56:34,230
of
kind of a sticky problem that we haven't

3506
00:56:34,230 --> 00:56:34,240
kind of a sticky problem that we haven't
 

3507
00:56:34,240 --> 00:56:35,910
kind of a sticky problem that we haven't
quite figured out maybe we'll solve that

3508
00:56:35,910 --> 00:56:35,920
quite figured out maybe we'll solve that
 

3509
00:56:35,920 --> 00:56:37,109
quite figured out maybe we'll solve that
one

3510
00:56:37,109 --> 00:56:37,119
one
 

3511
00:56:37,119 --> 00:56:39,349
one
i think one of the fascinating things in

3512
00:56:39,349 --> 00:56:39,359
i think one of the fascinating things in
 

3513
00:56:39,359 --> 00:56:41,270
i think one of the fascinating things in
your entire body of work but also the

3514
00:56:41,270 --> 00:56:41,280
your entire body of work but also the
 

3515
00:56:41,280 --> 00:56:42,870
your entire body of work but also the
work at open ai recently

3516
00:56:42,870 --> 00:56:42,880
work at open ai recently
 

3517
00:56:42,880 --> 00:56:44,549

one of the conversation changers has

3518
00:56:44,549 --> 00:56:44,559
one of the conversation changers has
 

3519
00:56:44,559 --> 00:56:47,030
one of the conversation changers has
been in the world of language models

3520
00:56:47,030 --> 00:56:47,040
been in the world of language models
 

3521
00:56:47,040 --> 00:56:50,150
been in the world of language models
can you briefly kind of try to describe

3522
00:56:50,150 --> 00:56:50,160
can you briefly kind of try to describe
 

3523
00:56:50,160 --> 00:56:51,589
can you briefly kind of try to describe
the recent history of using neural

3524
00:56:51,589 --> 00:56:51,599
the recent history of using neural
 

3525
00:56:51,599 --> 00:56:52,150
the recent history of using neural
networks

3526
00:56:52,150 --> 00:56:52,160
networks
 

3527
00:56:52,160 --> 00:56:54,630
networks
in the domain of language and text well

3528
00:56:54,630 --> 00:56:54,640
in the domain of language and text well
 

3529
00:56:54,640 --> 00:56:56,470
in the domain of language and text well
there's been lots of history

3530
00:56:56,470 --> 00:56:56,480
there's been lots of history
 

3531
00:56:56,480 --> 00:56:58,549
there's been lots of history
i think i think the elman network was

3532
00:56:58,549 --> 00:56:58,559
i think i think the elman network was
 

3533
00:56:58,559 --> 00:57:00,150
i think i think the elman network was
was this was was a small

3534
00:57:00,150 --> 00:57:00,160
was this was was a small
 

3535
00:57:00,160 --> 00:57:01,670
was this was was a small
tiny recurrent neural network applied to

3536
00:57:01,670 --> 00:57:01,680
tiny recurrent neural network applied to
 

3537
00:57:01,680 --> 00:57:03,829
tiny recurrent neural network applied to
language back in the 80s

3538
00:57:03,829 --> 00:57:03,839
language back in the 80s
 

3539
00:57:03,839 --> 00:57:07,109
language back in the 80s
so the history is really you know fairly

3540
00:57:07,109 --> 00:57:07,119
so the history is really you know fairly
 

3541
00:57:07,119 --> 00:57:08,630
so the history is really you know fairly
long at least

3542
00:57:08,630 --> 00:57:08,640
long at least
 

3543
00:57:08,640 --> 00:57:11,109
long at least
and the thing that started the thing

3544
00:57:11,109 --> 00:57:11,119
and the thing that started the thing
 

3545
00:57:11,119 --> 00:57:12,150
and the thing that started the thing
that changed

3546
00:57:12,150 --> 00:57:12,160
that changed
 

3547
00:57:12,160 --> 00:57:14,150
that changed
the trajectory of neural networks and

3548
00:57:14,150 --> 00:57:14,160
the trajectory of neural networks and
 

3549
00:57:14,160 --> 00:57:15,829
the trajectory of neural networks and
language is

3550
00:57:15,829 --> 00:57:15,839
language is
 

3551
00:57:15,839 --> 00:57:17,349
language is
the thing that changed the trajectory of

3552
00:57:17,349 --> 00:57:17,359
the thing that changed the trajectory of
 

3553
00:57:17,359 --> 00:57:18,470
the thing that changed the trajectory of
deep learning and that's data and

3554
00:57:18,470 --> 00:57:18,480
deep learning and that's data and
 

3555
00:57:18,480 --> 00:57:19,589
deep learning and that's data and
compute

3556
00:57:19,589 --> 00:57:19,599
compute
 

3557
00:57:19,599 --> 00:57:22,230
compute
so suddenly you move from small language

3558
00:57:22,230 --> 00:57:22,240
so suddenly you move from small language
 

3559
00:57:22,240 --> 00:57:22,950
so suddenly you move from small language
models which

3560
00:57:22,950 --> 00:57:22,960
models which
 

3561
00:57:22,960 --> 00:57:24,789
models which
learn a little bit and with language

3562
00:57:24,789 --> 00:57:24,799
learn a little bit and with language
 

3563
00:57:24,799 --> 00:57:26,549
learn a little bit and with language
models in particular you can

3564
00:57:26,549 --> 00:57:26,559
models in particular you can
 

3565
00:57:26,559 --> 00:57:28,950
models in particular you can
there's a very clear explanation for why

3566
00:57:28,950 --> 00:57:28,960
there's a very clear explanation for why
 

3567
00:57:28,960 --> 00:57:30,309
there's a very clear explanation for why
they need to be large

3568
00:57:30,309 --> 00:57:30,319
they need to be large
 

3569
00:57:30,319 --> 00:57:32,230
they need to be large
to be good because they're trying to

3570
00:57:32,230 --> 00:57:32,240
to be good because they're trying to
 

3571
00:57:32,240 --> 00:57:34,470
to be good because they're trying to
predict the next word

3572
00:57:34,470 --> 00:57:34,480
predict the next word
 

3573
00:57:34,480 --> 00:57:36,710
predict the next word
so we don't when you don't know anything

3574
00:57:36,710 --> 00:57:36,720
so we don't when you don't know anything
 

3575
00:57:36,720 --> 00:57:39,030
so we don't when you don't know anything
you'll notice very

3576
00:57:39,030 --> 00:57:39,040
you'll notice very
 

3577
00:57:39,040 --> 00:57:41,430
you'll notice very
very broad stroke surface level patterns

3578
00:57:41,430 --> 00:57:41,440
very broad stroke surface level patterns
 

3579
00:57:41,440 --> 00:57:42,950
very broad stroke surface level patterns
like

3580
00:57:42,950 --> 00:57:42,960
like
 

3581
00:57:42,960 --> 00:57:44,950
like
sometimes there are characters and there

3582
00:57:44,950 --> 00:57:44,960
sometimes there are characters and there
 

3583
00:57:44,960 --> 00:57:46,390
sometimes there are characters and there
is a space between those characters

3584
00:57:46,390 --> 00:57:46,400
is a space between those characters
 

3585
00:57:46,400 --> 00:57:47,750
is a space between those characters
you'll notice this pattern

3586
00:57:47,750 --> 00:57:47,760
you'll notice this pattern
 

3587
00:57:47,760 --> 00:57:49,190
you'll notice this pattern
and you'll notice that sometimes there

3588
00:57:49,190 --> 00:57:49,200
and you'll notice that sometimes there
 

3589
00:57:49,200 --> 00:57:50,950
and you'll notice that sometimes there
is a comma and then the next character

3590
00:57:50,950 --> 00:57:50,960
is a comma and then the next character
 

3591
00:57:50,960 --> 00:57:52,470
is a comma and then the next character
is a capital letter you'll notice that

3592
00:57:52,470 --> 00:57:52,480
is a capital letter you'll notice that
 

3593
00:57:52,480 --> 00:57:53,510
is a capital letter you'll notice that
pattern

3594
00:57:53,510 --> 00:57:53,520
pattern
 

3595
00:57:53,520 --> 00:57:55,030
pattern
eventually you may start to notice that

3596
00:57:55,030 --> 00:57:55,040
eventually you may start to notice that
 

3597
00:57:55,040 --> 00:57:57,109
eventually you may start to notice that
there are certain words occur often you

3598
00:57:57,109 --> 00:57:57,119
there are certain words occur often you
 

3599
00:57:57,119 --> 00:57:58,309
there are certain words occur often you
may notice that

3600
00:57:58,309 --> 00:57:58,319
may notice that
 

3601
00:57:58,319 --> 00:57:59,829
may notice that
spellings are a thing you may notice

3602
00:57:59,829 --> 00:57:59,839
spellings are a thing you may notice
 

3603
00:57:59,839 --> 00:58:01,750
spellings are a thing you may notice
syntax and when you get

3604
00:58:01,750 --> 00:58:01,760
syntax and when you get
 

3605
00:58:01,760 --> 00:58:03,910
syntax and when you get
really good at all these you start to

3606
00:58:03,910 --> 00:58:03,920
really good at all these you start to
 

3607
00:58:03,920 --> 00:58:05,750
really good at all these you start to
notice the semantics

3608
00:58:05,750 --> 00:58:05,760
notice the semantics
 

3609
00:58:05,760 --> 00:58:08,069
notice the semantics
you start to notice the facts but for

3610
00:58:08,069 --> 00:58:08,079
you start to notice the facts but for
 

3611
00:58:08,079 --> 00:58:09,750
you start to notice the facts but for
that to happen the language model needs

3612
00:58:09,750 --> 00:58:09,760
that to happen the language model needs
 

3613
00:58:09,760 --> 00:58:11,270
that to happen the language model needs
to be larger

3614
00:58:11,270 --> 00:58:11,280
to be larger
 

3615
00:58:11,280 --> 00:58:14,069
to be larger
so that's let's linger on that because

3616
00:58:14,069 --> 00:58:14,079
so that's let's linger on that because

so that's let's linger on that because
that's where you

that's where you
 

3619
00:58:14,880 --> 00:58:18,630
that's where you
and noam chomps could disagree

3621
00:58:18,640 --> 00:58:21,990

so you think we're actually taking uh

00:59:42,870 --> 00:59:42,880
of story of the review now why is that
 

3705
00:59:42,880 --> 00:59:44,710
of story of the review now why is that
sentiment is a pretty semantic

3706
00:59:44,710 --> 00:59:44,720
sentiment is a pretty semantic
 

3707
00:59:44,720 --> 00:59:46,710
sentiment is a pretty semantic
attribute it's not a syntactic attribute

3708
00:59:46,710 --> 00:59:46,720
attribute it's not a syntactic attribute
 

3709
00:59:46,720 --> 00:59:48,309
attribute it's not a syntactic attribute
and for people who might not know i

3710
00:59:48,309 --> 00:59:48,319
and for people who might not know i
 

3711
00:59:48,319 --> 00:59:49,510
and for people who might not know i
don't know if that's a standard term but

3712
00:59:49,510 --> 00:59:49,520
don't know if that's a standard term but
 

3713
00:59:49,520 --> 00:59:51,270
don't know if that's a standard term but
sentiment is whether it's a positive or

3714
00:59:51,270 --> 00:59:51,280
sentiment is whether it's a positive or
 

3715
00:59:51,280 --> 00:59:52,870
sentiment is whether it's a positive or
negative review that's right like this

3716
00:59:52,870 --> 00:59:52,880
negative review that's right like this
 

3717
00:59:52,880 --> 00:59:54,309
negative review that's right like this
is the person happy with something is

3718
00:59:54,309 --> 00:59:54,319
is the person happy with something is
 

3719
00:59:54,319 --> 00:59:55,990
is the person happy with something is
the person unhappy with something

3720
00:59:55,990 --> 00:59:56,000
the person unhappy with something
 

3721
00:59:56,000 --> 00:59:58,710
the person unhappy with something
and so here we had very clear evidence

3722
00:59:58,710 --> 00:59:58,720
and so here we had very clear evidence
 

3723
00:59:58,720 --> 00:59:59,750
and so here we had very clear evidence
that a small

3724
00:59:59,750 --> 00:59:59,760
that a small
 

3725
00:59:59,760 --> 01:00:01,829
that a small
neural net does not capture sentiment

3726
01:00:01,829 --> 01:00:01,839

3727
01:00:01,839 --> 01:00:03,510
neural net does not capture sentiment
while a large neural net does

3728
01:00:03,510 --> 01:00:03,520
while a large neural net does
 

3729
01:00:03,520 --> 01:00:06,230
while a large neural net does
and why is that well our theory is that

3730
01:00:06,230 --> 01:00:06,240
and why is that well our theory is that
 

3731
01:00:06,240 --> 01:00:07,349
and why is that well our theory is that
at some point

3732
01:00:07,349 --> 01:00:07,359
at some point
 

3733
01:00:07,359 --> 01:00:08,950
at some point
you run out of syntax to models you

3734
01:00:08,950 --> 01:00:08,960
you run out of syntax to models you
 

3735
01:00:08,960 --> 01:00:10,950
you run out of syntax to models you
start gotta focus on something else

3736
01:00:10,950 --> 01:00:10,960
start gotta focus on something else
 

3737
01:00:10,960 --> 01:00:14,150
start gotta focus on something else
and with size you quickly run out

3738
01:00:14,150 --> 01:00:14,160
and with size you quickly run out
 

3739
01:00:14,160 --> 01:00:16,630
and with size you quickly run out
of syntax to model and then you really

3740
01:00:16,630 --> 01:00:16,640
of syntax to model and then you really
 

3741
01:00:16,640 --> 01:00:18,470
of syntax to model and then you really
start to focus on the semantics is would

3742
01:00:18,470 --> 01:00:18,480
start to focus on the semantics is would
 

3743
01:00:18,480 --> 01:00:19,349
start to focus on the semantics is would
be the idea

3744
01:00:19,349 --> 01:00:19,359
be the idea
 

3745
01:00:19,359 --> 01:00:20,710
be the idea
that's right and so i don't i don't want

3746
01:00:20,710 --> 01:00:20,720
that's right and so i don't i don't want
 

3747
01:00:20,720 --> 01:00:22,710
that's right and so i don't i don't want
to imply that our models have complete

3748
01:00:22,710 --> 01:00:22,720
to imply that our models have complete
 

3749
01:00:22,720 --> 01:00:24,150
to imply that our models have complete

yeah so the thing is the transformer is

3810
01:01:23,349 --> 01:01:23,359
yeah so the thing is the transformer is
 

3811
01:01:23,359 --> 01:01:24,069
yeah so the thing is the transformer is
a combination

3812
01:01:24,069 --> 01:01:24,079
a combination
 

3813
01:01:24,079 --> 01:01:26,309
a combination
of multiple ideas simultaneously which

3814
01:01:26,309 --> 01:01:26,319
of multiple ideas simultaneously which
 

3815
01:01:26,319 --> 01:01:27,990
of multiple ideas simultaneously which
attention is one

3816
01:01:27,990 --> 01:01:28,000
attention is one
 

3817
01:01:28,000 --> 01:01:29,670
attention is one
do you think attention is the key no

3818
01:01:29,670 --> 01:01:29,680
do you think attention is the key no
 

3819
01:01:29,680 --> 01:01:32,309
do you think attention is the key no
it's a key but it's not the key

3820
01:01:32,309 --> 01:01:32,319
it's a key but it's not the key
 

3821
01:01:32,319 --> 01:01:34,950
it's a key but it's not the key
the transformer is successful because it

3822
01:01:34,950 --> 01:01:34,960
the transformer is successful because it
 

3823
01:01:34,960 --> 01:01:36,710
the transformer is successful because it
is the simultaneous combination of

3824
01:01:36,710 --> 01:01:36,720
is the simultaneous combination of
 

3825
01:01:36,720 --> 01:01:38,390
is the simultaneous combination of
multiple ideas and if you were to remove

3826
01:01:38,390 --> 01:01:38,400
multiple ideas and if you were to remove
 

3827
01:01:38,400 --> 01:01:39,670
multiple ideas and if you were to remove
either idea it would be much less

3828
01:01:39,670 --> 01:01:39,680
either idea it would be much less
 

3829
01:01:39,680 --> 01:01:41,430
either idea it would be much less
successful

3830
01:01:41,430 --> 01:01:41,440
successful
 

3831
01:01:41,440 --> 01:01:43,349
successful
so the transformer uses a lot of

3832
01:01:43,349 --> 01:01:43,359
so the transformer uses a lot of
 

3833
01:01:43,359 --> 01:01:44,870
so the transformer uses a lot of
attention but attention existed for a

3834
01:01:44,870 --> 01:01:44,880
attention but attention existed for a
 

3835
01:01:44,880 --> 01:01:45,670
attention but attention existed for a
few years

3836
01:01:45,670 --> 01:01:45,680
few years
 

3837
01:01:45,680 --> 01:01:48,470
few years
so that can't be the main innovation the

3838
01:01:48,470 --> 01:01:48,480
so that can't be the main innovation the
 

3839
01:01:48,480 --> 01:01:50,470
so that can't be the main innovation the
transformer

3840
01:01:50,470 --> 01:01:50,480
transformer
 

3841
01:01:50,480 --> 01:01:53,670
transformer
is designed in such a way that it runs

3842
01:01:53,670 --> 01:01:53,680
is designed in such a way that it runs
 

3843
01:01:53,680 --> 01:01:55,990
is designed in such a way that it runs
really fast on the gpu

3844
01:01:55,990 --> 01:01:56,000
really fast on the gpu
 

3845
01:01:56,000 --> 01:01:57,270
really fast on the gpu
and that makes a huge amount of

3846
01:01:57,270 --> 01:01:57,280
and that makes a huge amount of
 

3847
01:01:57,280 --> 01:01:59,270
and that makes a huge amount of
difference this is one thing

3848
01:01:59,270 --> 01:01:59,280
difference this is one thing
 

3849
01:01:59,280 --> 01:02:01,190
difference this is one thing
the second thing is the transformer is

3850
01:02:01,190 --> 01:02:01,200
the second thing is the transformer is
 

3851
01:02:01,200 --> 01:02:02,710
the second thing is the transformer is
not recurrent

3852
01:02:02,710 --> 01:02:02,720
not recurrent
 

3853
01:02:02,720 --> 01:02:05,270
not recurrent
and that is really important too because

3854
01:02:05,270 --> 01:02:05,280
and that is really important too because
 

3855
01:02:05,280 --> 01:02:06,950
and that is really important too because
it is more shallow and therefore much

3856
01:02:06,950 --> 01:02:06,960
it is more shallow and therefore much
 

3857
01:02:06,960 --> 01:02:08,230
it is more shallow and therefore much
easier to optimize

3858
01:02:08,230 --> 01:02:08,240
easier to optimize
 

3859
01:02:08,240 --> 01:02:10,549
easier to optimize
so in other words it uses attention it

3860
01:02:10,549 --> 01:02:10,559
so in other words it uses attention it
 

3861
01:02:10,559 --> 01:02:14,150
so in other words it uses attention it
is it is a really great fit to the gpu

3862
01:02:14,150 --> 01:02:14,160
is it is a really great fit to the gpu
 

3863
01:02:14,160 --> 01:02:16,069
is it is a really great fit to the gpu
and it is not recurrent so therefore

3864
01:02:16,069 --> 01:02:16,079
and it is not recurrent so therefore
 

3865
01:02:16,079 --> 01:02:17,829
and it is not recurrent so therefore
less deep and easier to optimize

3866
01:02:17,829 --> 01:02:17,839
less deep and easier to optimize
 

3867
01:02:17,839 --> 01:02:19,510
less deep and easier to optimize
and the combination of those factors

3868
01:02:19,510 --> 01:02:19,520
and the combination of those factors
 

3869
01:02:19,520 --> 01:02:21,589
and the combination of those factors
make it successful so now it makes

3870
01:02:21,589 --> 01:02:21,599
make it successful so now it makes
 

3871
01:02:21,599 --> 01:02:24,630
make it successful so now it makes
it makes great use of your gpu it allows

3872
01:02:24,630 --> 01:02:24,640
it makes great use of your gpu it allows
 

3873
01:02:24,640 --> 01:02:25,349
it makes great use of your gpu it allows
you to achieve

3874
01:02:25,349 --> 01:02:25,359
you to achieve
 

3875
01:02:25,359 --> 01:02:27,029
you to achieve
better results for the same amount of

3876
01:02:27,029 --> 01:02:27,039
better results for the same amount of
 

3877
01:02:27,039 --> 01:02:28,549
better results for the same amount of
compute

3878
01:02:28,549 --> 01:02:28,559
compute
 

3879
01:02:28,559 --> 01:02:31,349
compute
and that's why it's successful were you

3880
01:02:31,349 --> 01:02:31,359
and that's why it's successful were you
 

3881
01:02:31,359 --> 01:02:34,150
and that's why it's successful were you
surprised how well transformers worked

3882
01:02:34,150 --> 01:02:34,160
surprised how well transformers worked
 

3883
01:02:34,160 --> 01:02:36,789
surprised how well transformers worked
and gpt2 worked so you worked on

3884
01:02:36,789 --> 01:02:36,799
and gpt2 worked so you worked on
 

3885
01:02:36,799 --> 01:02:37,670
and gpt2 worked so you worked on
language

3886
01:02:37,670 --> 01:02:37,680
language
 

3887
01:02:37,680 --> 01:02:40,549
language
you've had a lot of great ideas before

3888
01:02:40,549 --> 01:02:40,559
you've had a lot of great ideas before
 

3889
01:02:40,559 --> 01:02:42,710
you've had a lot of great ideas before
transformers came about in language

3890
01:02:42,710 --> 01:02:42,720
transformers came about in language
 

3891
01:02:42,720 --> 01:02:44,309
transformers came about in language
so you got to see the whole set of

3892
01:02:44,309 --> 01:02:44,319
so you got to see the whole set of
 

3893
01:02:44,319 --> 01:02:45,990
so you got to see the whole set of
revolutions before and after

3894
01:02:45,990 --> 01:02:46,000
revolutions before and after
 

3895
01:02:46,000 --> 01:02:48,710
revolutions before and after
were you surprised yeah a little a

3896
01:02:48,710 --> 01:02:48,720
were you surprised yeah a little a
 

3897
01:02:48,720 --> 01:02:49,109
were you surprised yeah a little a
little

3898
01:02:49,109 --> 01:02:49,119
little
 

3899
01:02:49,119 --> 01:02:51,349
little
yeah i mean it's hard it's hard to

3900
01:02:51,349 --> 01:02:51,359
yeah i mean it's hard it's hard to
 

3901
01:02:51,359 --> 01:02:52,789
yeah i mean it's hard it's hard to
remember because

3902
01:02:52,789 --> 01:02:52,799
remember because
 

3903
01:02:52,799 --> 01:02:54,630
remember because
you adapt really quickly but it

3904
01:02:54,630 --> 01:02:54,640
you adapt really quickly but it
 

3905
01:02:54,640 --> 01:02:56,470
you adapt really quickly but it
definitely was surprising it definitely

3906
01:02:56,470 --> 01:02:56,480
definitely was surprising it definitely
 

3907
01:02:56,480 --> 01:02:57,670
definitely was surprising it definitely
was in fact i'll

3908
01:02:57,670 --> 01:02:57,680
was in fact i'll
 

3909
01:02:57,680 --> 01:02:59,829
was in fact i'll
you know what i'll i'll retract my

3910
01:02:59,829 --> 01:02:59,839
you know what i'll i'll retract my
 

3911
01:02:59,839 --> 01:03:00,870
you know what i'll i'll retract my
statement it was

3912
01:03:00,870 --> 01:03:00,880
statement it was
 

3913
01:03:00,880 --> 01:03:02,950
statement it was
it was pretty amazing it was just

3914
01:03:02,950 --> 01:03:02,960
it was pretty amazing it was just
 

3915
01:03:02,960 --> 01:03:05,109
it was pretty amazing it was just
amazing to see generate this text

3916
01:03:05,109 --> 01:03:05,119
amazing to see generate this text
 

3917
01:03:05,119 --> 01:03:06,950
amazing to see generate this text
of this and you know you got to keep in

3918
01:03:06,950 --> 01:03:06,960
of this and you know you got to keep in
 

3919
01:03:06,960 --> 01:03:08,789
of this and you know you got to keep in
mind that we've seen at that time we've

3920
01:03:08,789 --> 01:03:08,799
mind that we've seen at that time we've
 

3921
01:03:08,799 --> 01:03:10,390
mind that we've seen at that time we've
seen all this progress in gans

3922
01:03:10,390 --> 01:03:10,400
seen all this progress in gans
 

3923
01:03:10,400 --> 01:03:12,470
seen all this progress in gans
in improving you know the samples

3924
01:03:12,470 --> 01:03:12,480
in improving you know the samples
 

3925
01:03:12,480 --> 01:03:14,549
in improving you know the samples
produced by cans were just amazing

3926
01:03:14,549 --> 01:03:14,559
produced by cans were just amazing
 

3927
01:03:14,559 --> 01:03:16,309
produced by cans were just amazing
you have these realistic faces but text

3928
01:03:16,309 --> 01:03:16,319
you have these realistic faces but text
 

3929
01:03:16,319 --> 01:03:17,829
you have these realistic faces but text
hasn't really moved that much

3930
01:03:17,829 --> 01:03:17,839
hasn't really moved that much
 

3931
01:03:17,839 --> 01:03:20,390
hasn't really moved that much
and suddenly we moved from you know

3932
01:03:20,390 --> 01:03:20,400
and suddenly we moved from you know
 

3933
01:03:20,400 --> 01:03:23,029
and suddenly we moved from you know
whatever gans were in 2015

3934
01:03:23,029 --> 01:03:23,039
whatever gans were in 2015
 

3935
01:03:23,039 --> 01:03:25,430
whatever gans were in 2015
to the best most amazing gans in one

3936
01:03:25,430 --> 01:03:25,440
to the best most amazing gans in one
 

3937
01:03:25,440 --> 01:03:27,430
to the best most amazing gans in one
step right and i was really stunning

3938
01:03:27,430 --> 01:03:27,440
step right and i was really stunning
 

3939
01:03:27,440 --> 01:03:29,270
step right and i was really stunning
even though theory predicted yeah you

3940
01:03:29,270 --> 01:03:29,280
even though theory predicted yeah you
 

3941
01:03:29,280 --> 01:03:30,789
even though theory predicted yeah you
train a big language model of course you

3942
01:03:30,789 --> 01:03:30,799
train a big language model of course you
 

3943
01:03:30,799 --> 01:03:31,670
train a big language model of course you
should get this

3944
01:03:31,670 --> 01:03:31,680
should get this
 

3945
01:03:31,680 --> 01:03:33,109
should get this
but then to see it with your own eyes

3946
01:03:33,109 --> 01:03:33,119
but then to see it with your own eyes
 

3947
01:03:33,119 --> 01:03:34,789
but then to see it with your own eyes
it's something else

3948
01:03:34,789 --> 01:03:34,799
it's something else
 

3949
01:03:34,799 --> 01:03:37,510
it's something else
and yet we adapt really quickly and now

3950
01:03:37,510 --> 01:03:37,520
and yet we adapt really quickly and now
 

3951
01:03:37,520 --> 01:03:37,990
and yet we adapt really quickly and now
there's

3952
01:03:37,990 --> 01:03:38,000
there's
 

3953
01:03:38,000 --> 01:03:41,510
there's
uh sort of

3954
01:03:41,510 --> 01:03:41,520
uh sort of
 

3955
01:03:41,520 --> 01:03:44,710
uh sort of
some cognitive scientists write articles

3956
01:03:44,710 --> 01:03:44,720
some cognitive scientists write articles
 

3957
01:03:44,720 --> 01:03:47,510
some cognitive scientists write articles
saying that gpt2 models don't truly

3958
01:03:47,510 --> 01:03:47,520
saying that gpt2 models don't truly
 

3959
01:03:47,520 --> 01:03:48,309
saying that gpt2 models don't truly

language so we adapt quickly to how

3962
01:03:50,710 --> 01:03:50,720
language so we adapt quickly to how
 

3963
01:03:50,720 --> 01:03:51,750
language so we adapt quickly to how
amazing

3964
01:03:51,750 --> 01:03:51,760
amazing
 

3965
01:03:51,760 --> 01:03:53,510
amazing
the fact that they're able to model the

3966
01:03:53,510 --> 01:03:53,520
the fact that they're able to model the
 

3967
01:03:53,520 --> 01:03:55,589
the fact that they're able to model the
language so well is

3968
01:03:55,589 --> 01:03:55,599
language so well is
 

3969
01:03:55,599 --> 01:03:58,710
language so well is
so what do you think is the bar

3970
01:03:58,710 --> 01:03:58,720
so what do you think is the bar
 

3971
01:03:58,720 --> 01:04:02,309
so what do you think is the bar
for what for impressing us that it

3972
01:04:02,309 --> 01:04:02,319
for what for impressing us that it
 

3973
01:04:02,319 --> 01:04:04,630
for what for impressing us that it
i don't know do you think that bar will

3974
01:04:04,630 --> 01:04:04,640
i don't know do you think that bar will
 

3975
01:04:04,640 --> 01:04:06,069
i don't know do you think that bar will
continuously be moved

3976
01:04:06,069 --> 01:04:06,079
continuously be moved
 

3977
01:04:06,079 --> 01:04:08,390
continuously be moved
definitely i i think when you start to

3978
01:04:08,390 --> 01:04:08,400
definitely i i think when you start to
 

3979
01:04:08,400 --> 01:04:09,430
definitely i i think when you start to
see really

3980
01:04:09,430 --> 01:04:09,440
see really
 

3981
01:04:09,440 --> 01:04:11,910
see really
dramatic economic impact that's when i

3982
01:04:11,910 --> 01:04:11,920
dramatic economic impact that's when i
 

3983
01:04:11,920 --> 01:04:12,950
dramatic economic impact that's when i
think that's in some sense

3984
01:04:12,950 --> 01:04:12,960
think that's in some sense
 

3985
01:04:12,960 --> 01:04:14,630
think that's in some sense
the next barrier because right now if

3986
01:04:14,630 --> 01:04:14,640
the next barrier because right now if
 

3987
01:04:14,640 --> 01:04:16,789
the next barrier because right now if
you think about the working ai

3988
01:04:16,789 --> 01:04:16,799
you think about the working ai
 

3989
01:04:16,799 --> 01:04:19,589
you think about the working ai
it's really confusing it's really hard

3990
01:04:19,589 --> 01:04:19,599
it's really confusing it's really hard
 

3991
01:04:19,599 --> 01:04:21,190
it's really confusing it's really hard
to know what to make of all these

3992
01:04:21,190 --> 01:04:21,200
to know what to make of all these
 

3993
01:04:21,200 --> 01:04:22,470
to know what to make of all these
advances

3994
01:04:22,470 --> 01:04:22,480
advances
 

3995
01:04:22,480 --> 01:04:25,029
advances
it's kind of like okay you got an

3996
01:04:25,029 --> 01:04:25,039
it's kind of like okay you got an
 

3997
01:04:25,039 --> 01:04:26,150
it's kind of like okay you got an
advance and now you can do

3998
01:04:26,150 --> 01:04:26,160
advance and now you can do
 

3999
01:04:26,160 --> 01:04:28,150
advance and now you can do
more things and you got another

4000
01:04:28,150 --> 01:04:28,160
more things and you got another
 

4001
01:04:28,160 --> 01:04:29,750
more things and you got another
improvement and you got another cool

4002
01:04:29,750 --> 01:04:29,760
improvement and you got another cool
 

4003
01:04:29,760 --> 01:04:30,309

at some point i think

4006
01:04:33,670 --> 01:04:33,680
at some point i think
 

4007
01:04:33,680 --> 01:04:36,710
at some point i think
people who are outside of ai they can no

4008
01:04:36,710 --> 01:04:36,720
people who are outside of ai they can no
 

4009
01:04:36,720 --> 01:04:38,549
people who are outside of ai they can no
longer distinguish this progress anymore

4010
01:04:38,549 --> 01:04:38,559
longer distinguish this progress anymore
 

4011
01:04:38,559 --> 01:04:39,990
longer distinguish this progress anymore
so we were talking offline

4012
01:04:39,990 --> 01:04:40,000
so we were talking offline
 

4013
01:04:40,000 --> 01:04:42,150
so we were talking offline
about translating russian to english and

about translating russian to english and
 

4015
01:04:42,160 --> 01:04:43,670
about translating russian to english and
how there's a lot of brilliant work in

do you think translation is the place

4030
01:04:53,750 --> 01:04:53,760
do you think translation is the place
 

4031
01:04:53,760 --> 01:04:54,950
do you think translation is the place
where we're going to see sort of

4032
01:04:54,950 --> 01:04:54,960
where we're going to see sort of
 

4033
01:04:54,960 --> 01:04:55,990
where we're going to see sort of
economic

4034
01:04:55,990 --> 01:04:56,000
economic
 

4035
01:04:56,000 --> 01:04:58,390
economic
big impact i i don't know i i think i

4036
01:04:58,390 --> 01:04:58,400
big impact i i don't know i i think i
 

4037
01:04:58,400 --> 01:04:59,990
big impact i i don't know i i think i
think there is a huge number of

4038
01:04:59,990 --> 01:05:00,000
think there is a huge number of
 

4039
01:05:00,000 --> 01:05:01,589
think there is a huge number of
i mean first of all i would want to i

4040
01:05:01,589 --> 01:05:01,599
i mean first of all i would want to i
 

4041
01:05:01,599 --> 01:05:03,270
i mean first of all i would want to i
want to point out the translation

4042
01:05:03,270 --> 01:05:03,280
want to point out the translation
 

4043
01:05:03,280 --> 01:05:06,309
want to point out the translation
already today is huge i think billions

4044
01:05:06,309 --> 01:05:06,319
already today is huge i think billions
 

4045
01:05:06,319 --> 01:05:08,309
already today is huge i think billions
of people interact with

4046
01:05:08,309 --> 01:05:08,319
of people interact with
 

4047
01:05:08,319 --> 01:05:10,230
of people interact with
uh big chunks of the internet primarily

4048
01:05:10,230 --> 01:05:10,240
uh big chunks of the internet primarily
 

4049
01:05:10,240 --> 01:05:11,750
uh big chunks of the internet primarily
through translation so

4050
01:05:11,750 --> 01:05:11,760
through translation so
 

4051
01:05:11,760 --> 01:05:13,910
through translation so
translation is already huge and it's

4052
01:05:13,910 --> 01:05:13,920
translation is already huge and it's
 

4053
01:05:13,920 --> 01:05:16,309
translation is already huge and it's
hugely hugely positive too

4054
01:05:16,309 --> 01:05:16,319
hugely hugely positive too
 

4055
01:05:16,319 --> 01:05:18,789
hugely hugely positive too
i think self-driving is going to be

4056
01:05:18,789 --> 01:05:18,799
i think self-driving is going to be
 

4057
01:05:18,799 --> 01:05:20,230
i think self-driving is going to be
hugely impactful

4058
01:05:20,230 --> 01:05:20,240
hugely impactful
 

4059
01:05:20,240 --> 01:05:23,349
hugely impactful
and that's you know it's it's unknown

4060
01:05:23,349 --> 01:05:23,359
and that's you know it's it's unknown
 

4061
01:05:23,359 --> 01:05:25,109
and that's you know it's it's unknown
exactly when it happens but again i

4062
01:05:25,109 --> 01:05:25,119
exactly when it happens but again i
 

4063
01:05:25,119 --> 01:05:25,430
exactly when it happens but again i
would

4064
01:05:25,430 --> 01:05:25,440
would
 

4065
01:05:25,440 --> 01:05:27,430
would
i would not bet against deep learning so

4066
01:05:27,430 --> 01:05:27,440
i would not bet against deep learning so
 

4067
01:05:27,440 --> 01:05:29,430
i would not bet against deep learning so
i so that's deep learning in general but

4068
01:05:29,430 --> 01:05:29,440
i so that's deep learning in general but
 

4069
01:05:29,440 --> 01:05:29,990
i so that's deep learning in general but
you

4070
01:05:29,990 --> 01:05:30,000
you
 

4071
01:05:30,000 --> 01:05:31,990
you
you keep learning for self-driving yes

4072
01:05:31,990 --> 01:05:32,000
you keep learning for self-driving yes
 

4073
01:05:32,000 --> 01:05:33,349
you keep learning for self-driving yes
deep learning for self-driving but

4074
01:05:33,349 --> 01:05:33,359
deep learning for self-driving but
 

4075
01:05:33,359 --> 01:05:34,710
deep learning for self-driving but
i was talking about sort of language

4076
01:05:34,710 --> 01:05:34,720
i was talking about sort of language
 

4077
01:05:34,720 --> 01:05:36,390
i was talking about sort of language
models let's see just to ch

4078
01:05:36,390 --> 01:05:36,400
models let's see just to ch
 

4079
01:05:36,400 --> 01:05:38,470
models let's see just to ch
just spear it off a little bit just to

4080
01:05:38,470 --> 01:05:38,480
just spear it off a little bit just to
 

4081
01:05:38,480 --> 01:05:39,829
just spear it off a little bit just to
check you're not seeing a connection

4082
01:05:39,829 --> 01:05:39,839
check you're not seeing a connection
 

4083
01:05:39,839 --> 01:05:41,670
check you're not seeing a connection
between driving and language no no

4084
01:05:41,670 --> 01:05:41,680
between driving and language no no
 

4085
01:05:41,680 --> 01:05:44,069
between driving and language no no
okay all right they both use neural nets

4086
01:05:44,069 --> 01:05:44,079
okay all right they both use neural nets
 

4087
01:05:44,079 --> 01:05:45,670
okay all right they both use neural nets
they'll be a poetic connection i think

4088
01:05:45,670 --> 01:05:45,680
they'll be a poetic connection i think
 

4089
01:05:45,680 --> 01:05:47,109
they'll be a poetic connection i think
there might be some

4090
01:05:47,109 --> 01:05:47,119
there might be some
 

4091
01:05:47,119 --> 01:05:48,309
there might be some
like you said there might be some kind

4092
01:05:48,309 --> 01:05:48,319
like you said there might be some kind
 

4093
01:05:48,319 --> 01:05:50,549
like you said there might be some kind
of unification towards uh

4094
01:05:50,549 --> 01:05:50,559
of unification towards uh
 

4095
01:05:50,559 --> 01:05:54,390
of unification towards uh
a kind of multi-task transformers

4096
01:05:54,390 --> 01:05:54,400
a kind of multi-task transformers
 

4097
01:05:54,400 --> 01:05:56,230
a kind of multi-task transformers
that can take on both language and

4098
01:05:56,230 --> 01:05:56,240
that can take on both language and
 

4099
01:05:56,240 --> 01:05:57,990
that can take on both language and
vision tasks

4100
01:05:57,990 --> 01:05:58,000
vision tasks
 

4101
01:05:58,000 --> 01:06:01,270
vision tasks
that'd be an interesting unification

4102
01:06:01,270 --> 01:06:01,280
that'd be an interesting unification
 

4103
01:06:01,280 --> 01:06:03,349
that'd be an interesting unification
now let's see what can i ask about gpt2

4104
01:06:03,349 --> 01:06:03,359
now let's see what can i ask about gpt2
 

4105
01:06:03,359 --> 01:06:04,870
now let's see what can i ask about gpt2
more um

4106
01:06:04,870 --> 01:06:04,880
more um
 

4107
01:06:04,880 --> 01:06:07,589
more um
it's simple it's not much to ask it's so

4108
01:06:07,589 --> 01:06:07,599
it's simple it's not much to ask it's so
 

4109
01:06:07,599 --> 01:06:08,390
it's simple it's not much to ask it's so
you take it

4110
01:06:08,390 --> 01:06:08,400
you take it
 

4111
01:06:08,400 --> 01:06:09,750
you take it
you take a transform you make it bigger

4112
01:06:09,750 --> 01:06:09,760
you take a transform you make it bigger
 

4113
01:06:09,760 --> 01:06:11,109
you take a transform you make it bigger
you give it more data and suddenly it

4114
01:06:11,109 --> 01:06:11,119
you give it more data and suddenly it
 

4115
01:06:11,119 --> 01:06:12,549
you give it more data and suddenly it
does all those amazing things

4116
01:06:12,549 --> 01:06:12,559
does all those amazing things
 

4117
01:06:12,559 --> 01:06:14,230
does all those amazing things
yeah one of the beautiful things is that

4118
01:06:14,230 --> 01:06:14,240
yeah one of the beautiful things is that
 

4119
01:06:14,240 --> 01:06:16,230
yeah one of the beautiful things is that
gpg the transformers are

4120
01:06:16,230 --> 01:06:16,240
gpg the transformers are
 

4121
01:06:16,240 --> 01:06:20,230
gpg the transformers are
fundamentally simple to explain to train

4122
01:06:20,230 --> 01:06:20,240
fundamentally simple to explain to train
 

4123
01:06:20,240 --> 01:06:23,990
fundamentally simple to explain to train
do you think bigger will continue to

4124
01:06:23,990 --> 01:06:24,000
do you think bigger will continue to
 

4125
01:06:24,000 --> 01:06:25,190
do you think bigger will continue to
show better results

4126
01:06:25,190 --> 01:06:25,200
show better results
 

4127
01:06:25,200 --> 01:06:28,230
show better results
in language probably

4128
01:06:28,230 --> 01:06:28,240
in language probably
 

4129
01:06:28,240 --> 01:06:29,589
in language probably
sort of like what are the next steps

4130
01:06:29,589 --> 01:06:29,599
sort of like what are the next steps
 

4131
01:06:29,599 --> 01:06:31,270
sort of like what are the next steps
with gpt2 do you think

4132
01:06:31,270 --> 01:06:31,280
with gpt2 do you think
 

4133
01:06:31,280 --> 01:06:33,910
with gpt2 do you think
i mean for i think for for sure seeing

4134
01:06:33,910 --> 01:06:33,920
i mean for i think for for sure seeing
 

4135
01:06:33,920 --> 01:06:34,309
i mean for i think for for sure seeing
what

4136
01:06:34,309 --> 01:06:34,319
what
 

4137
01:06:34,319 --> 01:06:36,150
what
uh larger versions can do is one

4138
01:06:36,150 --> 01:06:36,160
uh larger versions can do is one
 

4139
01:06:36,160 --> 01:06:37,589
uh larger versions can do is one
direction

4140
01:06:37,589 --> 01:06:37,599
direction
 

4141
01:06:37,599 --> 01:06:40,710
direction
also i mean there are there are many

4142
01:06:40,710 --> 01:06:40,720
also i mean there are there are many
 

4143
01:06:40,720 --> 01:06:41,990
also i mean there are there are many
questions there's one question which i'm

4144
01:06:41,990 --> 01:06:42,000
questions there's one question which i'm
 

4145
01:06:42,000 --> 01:06:43,829
questions there's one question which i'm
curious about and that's the following

4146
01:06:43,829 --> 01:06:43,839
curious about and that's the following
 

4147
01:06:43,839 --> 01:06:45,990
curious about and that's the following
so right now gpt2 so we feed all this

4148
01:06:45,990 --> 01:06:46,000
so right now gpt2 so we feed all this
 

4149
01:06:46,000 --> 01:06:47,270
so right now gpt2 so we feed all this
data from the internet which means that

4150
01:06:47,270 --> 01:06:47,280
data from the internet which means that
 

4151
01:06:47,280 --> 01:06:48,630
data from the internet which means that
he needs to memorize all those

4152
01:06:48,630 --> 01:06:48,640
he needs to memorize all those
 

4153
01:06:48,640 --> 01:06:50,390
he needs to memorize all those
random facts about everything in the

4154
01:06:50,390 --> 01:06:50,400
random facts about everything in the
 

4155
01:06:50,400 --> 01:06:51,829
random facts about everything in the
internet

4156
01:06:51,829 --> 01:06:51,839
internet
 

4157
01:06:51,839 --> 01:06:55,349
internet
and it would be nice if

4158
01:06:55,349 --> 01:06:55,359
and it would be nice if
 

4159
01:06:55,359 --> 01:06:57,990
and it would be nice if
the model could somehow use its own

4160
01:06:57,990 --> 01:06:58,000
the model could somehow use its own
 

4161
01:06:58,000 --> 01:06:59,029
the model could somehow use its own
intelligence

4162
01:06:59,029 --> 01:06:59,039
intelligence
 

4163
01:06:59,039 --> 01:07:01,270
intelligence
to decide what data it wants to study

4164
01:07:01,270 --> 01:07:01,280
to decide what data it wants to study
 

4165
01:07:01,280 --> 01:07:03,430
to decide what data it wants to study
accept and what data it wants to reject

4166
01:07:03,430 --> 01:07:03,440
accept and what data it wants to reject
 

4167
01:07:03,440 --> 01:07:06,069
accept and what data it wants to reject
just like people people don't learn all

4168
01:07:06,069 --> 01:07:06,079
just like people people don't learn all
 

4169
01:07:06,079 --> 01:07:07,670
just like people people don't learn all
data indiscriminately we are

4170
01:07:07,670 --> 01:07:07,680
data indiscriminately we are
 

4171
01:07:07,680 --> 01:07:09,829
data indiscriminately we are
super selective about what we learn and

4172
01:07:09,829 --> 01:07:09,839
super selective about what we learn and
 

4173
01:07:09,839 --> 01:07:11,589
super selective about what we learn and
i think this kind of active learning i

4174
01:07:11,589 --> 01:07:11,599
i think this kind of active learning i
 

4175
01:07:11,599 --> 01:07:14,150
i think this kind of active learning i
think would be very nice to have

4176
01:07:14,150 --> 01:07:14,160
think would be very nice to have
 

4177
01:07:14,160 --> 01:07:17,670
think would be very nice to have
yeah listen i love active learning so

4178
01:07:17,670 --> 01:07:17,680
yeah listen i love active learning so
 

4179
01:07:17,680 --> 01:07:21,029
yeah listen i love active learning so
let me ask does the selection of data

4180
01:07:21,029 --> 01:07:21,039
let me ask does the selection of data
 

4181
01:07:21,039 --> 01:07:22,630
let me ask does the selection of data
can you just elaborate that a little bit

4182
01:07:22,630 --> 01:07:22,640
can you just elaborate that a little bit
 

4183
01:07:22,640 --> 01:07:25,670
can you just elaborate that a little bit
more do you think the selection of data

4184
01:07:25,670 --> 01:07:25,680
more do you think the selection of data
 

4185
01:07:25,680 --> 01:07:29,829
more do you think the selection of data
is um like i i have this kind of sense

4186
01:07:29,829 --> 01:07:29,839
is um like i i have this kind of sense
 

4187
01:07:29,839 --> 01:07:33,270
is um like i i have this kind of sense
that the optimization of how you select

4188
01:07:33,270 --> 01:07:33,280
that the optimization of how you select
 

4189
01:07:33,280 --> 01:07:33,990
that the optimization of how you select
data so

4190
01:07:33,990 --> 01:07:34,000
data so
 

4191
01:07:34,000 --> 01:07:37,270
data so
the active learning process is going to

4192
01:07:37,270 --> 01:07:37,280
the active learning process is going to
 

4193
01:07:37,280 --> 01:07:37,910
the active learning process is going to
be

4194
01:07:37,910 --> 01:07:37,920
be
 

4195
01:07:37,920 --> 01:07:41,029
be
a place for a lot of breakthroughs even

4196
01:07:41,029 --> 01:07:41,039
a place for a lot of breakthroughs even
 

4197
01:07:41,039 --> 01:07:41,990
a place for a lot of breakthroughs even
in the near future

4198
01:07:41,990 --> 01:07:42,000
in the near future
 

4199
01:07:42,000 --> 01:07:43,190
in the near future
because there hasn't been many

4200
01:07:43,190 --> 01:07:43,200
because there hasn't been many
 

4201
01:07:43,200 --> 01:07:45,029
because there hasn't been many
breakthroughs there that are public i

4202
01:07:45,029 --> 01:07:45,039
breakthroughs there that are public i
 

4203
01:07:45,039 --> 01:07:46,230
breakthroughs there that are public i
feel like there might be

4204
01:07:46,230 --> 01:07:46,240
feel like there might be
 

4205
01:07:46,240 --> 01:07:48,150
feel like there might be
private breakthroughs that companies

4206
01:07:48,150 --> 01:07:48,160
private breakthroughs that companies
 

4207
01:07:48,160 --> 01:07:49,430
private breakthroughs that companies
keep to themselves because the

4208
01:07:49,430 --> 01:07:49,440
keep to themselves because the
 

4209
01:07:49,440 --> 01:07:51,349
keep to themselves because the
fundamental problem has to be solved

4210
01:07:51,349 --> 01:07:51,359
fundamental problem has to be solved
 

4211
01:07:51,359 --> 01:07:53,029
fundamental problem has to be solved
if you want to solve self-driving if you

4212
01:07:53,029 --> 01:07:53,039
if you want to solve self-driving if you
 

4213
01:07:53,039 --> 01:07:54,390
if you want to solve self-driving if you
want to solve a particular

4214
01:07:54,390 --> 01:07:54,400
want to solve a particular
 

4215
01:07:54,400 --> 01:07:56,549
want to solve a particular
task but do you what do you think about

4216
01:07:56,549 --> 01:07:56,559
task but do you what do you think about
 

4217
01:07:56,559 --> 01:07:57,750
task but do you what do you think about
the space in general

4218
01:07:57,750 --> 01:07:57,760
the space in general
 

4219
01:07:57,760 --> 01:07:59,430
the space in general
yeah so i think that for something like

4220
01:07:59,430 --> 01:07:59,440
yeah so i think that for something like
 

4221
01:07:59,440 --> 01:08:00,870
yeah so i think that for something like
active learning or in fact for

4222
01:08:00,870 --> 01:08:00,880
active learning or in fact for
 

4223
01:08:00,880 --> 01:08:02,870
active learning or in fact for
any kind of capability like active

4224
01:08:02,870 --> 01:08:02,880
any kind of capability like active
 

4225
01:08:02,880 --> 01:08:04,549
any kind of capability like active
learning the thing that it really needs

4226
01:08:04,549 --> 01:08:04,559
learning the thing that it really needs
 

4227
01:08:04,559 --> 01:08:05,670
learning the thing that it really needs
is a problem

4228
01:08:05,670 --> 01:08:05,680
is a problem
 

4229
01:08:05,680 --> 01:08:09,270
is a problem
it needs a problem that requires it

4230
01:08:09,270 --> 01:08:09,280
it needs a problem that requires it
 

4231
01:08:09,280 --> 01:08:11,349
it needs a problem that requires it
it's very hard to do research about the

4232
01:08:11,349 --> 01:08:11,359
it's very hard to do research about the
 

4233
01:08:11,359 --> 01:08:12,870
it's very hard to do research about the
capability if you don't have a task

4234
01:08:12,870 --> 01:08:12,880
capability if you don't have a task
 

4235
01:08:12,880 --> 01:08:14,390
capability if you don't have a task
because then what's going to happen is

4236
01:08:14,390 --> 01:08:14,400
because then what's going to happen is
 

4237
01:08:14,400 --> 01:08:16,630
because then what's going to happen is
you will come up with an artificial task

you will come up with an artificial task
 

4239
01:08:16,640 --> 01:08:17,829
you will come up with an artificial task
get good results

4240

get good results
 

4241
01:08:17,839 --> 01:08:20,950
get good results
but not really convince anyone right

started a conversation about this like

4314
01:09:29,990 --> 01:09:30,000
started a conversation about this like
 

4315
01:09:30,000 --> 01:09:32,229
started a conversation about this like
how do we release

4316
01:09:32,229 --> 01:09:32,239
how do we release
 

4317
01:09:32,239 --> 01:09:34,709
how do we release

01:09:36,080 --> 01:09:39,030
to the public
if we do it all how do we privately

4322
01:09:39,030 --> 01:09:39,040
if we do it all how do we privately
 

4323
01:09:39,040 --> 01:09:39,669
if we do it all how do we privately
discuss

with other even competitors about

01:09:42,799 --> 01:09:45,430
with other even competitors about
how we manage the use of the systems and

01:09:45,430 --> 01:09:45,440
how we manage the use of the systems and

01:09:45,440 --> 01:09:45,990
how we manage the use of the systems and
so on

4330
01:09:45,990 --> 01:09:46,000
so on
 

4331
01:09:46,000 --> 01:09:47,990
so on
so from that this whole experience you

4332
01:09:47,990 --> 01:09:48,000
so from that this whole experience you
 

4333
01:09:48,000 --> 01:09:49,430
so from that this whole experience you
released a report on it

4334
01:09:49,430 --> 01:09:49,440
released a report on it
 

4335
01:09:49,440 --> 01:09:51,669
released a report on it
but in general are there any insights

4336
01:09:51,669 --> 01:09:51,679
but in general are there any insights
 

4337
01:09:51,679 --> 01:09:52,950
but in general are there any insights
that you've gathered

4338
01:09:52,950 --> 01:09:52,960
that you've gathered
 

4339
01:09:52,960 --> 01:09:55,830
that you've gathered
from just thinking about this about how

4340
01:09:55,830 --> 01:09:55,840
from just thinking about this about how
 

4341
01:09:55,840 --> 01:09:57,590
from just thinking about this about how
you release models like this

4342
01:09:57,590 --> 01:09:57,600
you release models like this
 

4343
01:09:57,600 --> 01:10:00,709
you release models like this
i mean i think that my take on this is

4344
01:10:00,709 --> 01:10:00,719
i mean i think that my take on this is
 

4345
01:10:00,719 --> 01:10:02,390
i mean i think that my take on this is
that the field of ai

4346
01:10:02,390 --> 01:10:02,400
that the field of ai
 

4347
01:10:02,400 --> 01:10:05,270
that the field of ai
has been in a state of childhood and now

4348
01:10:05,270 --> 01:10:05,280
has been in a state of childhood and now
 

4349
01:10:05,280 --> 01:10:06,630
has been in a state of childhood and now
it's exiting that state

4350
01:10:06,630 --> 01:10:06,640
it's exiting that state
 

4351
01:10:06,640 --> 01:10:09,430
it's exiting that state
and it's entering a state of maturity

4352
01:10:09,430 --> 01:10:09,440
and it's entering a state of maturity
 

4353
01:10:09,440 --> 01:10:11,110
and it's entering a state of maturity
what that means is that ai is very

4354
01:10:11,110 --> 01:10:11,120
what that means is that ai is very
 

4355
01:10:11,120 --> 01:10:12,149
what that means is that ai is very
successful

4356
01:10:12,149 --> 01:10:12,159
successful
 

4357
01:10:12,159 --> 01:10:14,790
successful
and also very impactful and its impact

4358
01:10:14,790 --> 01:10:14,800
and also very impactful and its impact
 

4359
01:10:14,800 --> 01:10:17,990
and also very impactful and its impact
is not only large but it's also growing

4360
01:10:17,990 --> 01:10:18,000
is not only large but it's also growing
 

4361
01:10:18,000 --> 01:10:21,590
is not only large but it's also growing
and so for that reason it seems wise to

4362
01:10:21,590 --> 01:10:21,600
and so for that reason it seems wise to
 

4363
01:10:21,600 --> 01:10:22,709
and so for that reason it seems wise to
start thinking

4364
01:10:22,709 --> 01:10:22,719
start thinking
 

4365
01:10:22,719 --> 01:10:24,630
start thinking
about the impact of our systems before

4366
01:10:24,630 --> 01:10:24,640
about the impact of our systems before
 

4367
01:10:24,640 --> 01:10:25,750
about the impact of our systems before
releasing them

4368
01:10:25,750 --> 01:10:25,760
releasing them
 

4369
01:10:25,760 --> 01:10:27,750
releasing them
maybe a little bit too soon rather than

4370
01:10:27,750 --> 01:10:27,760
maybe a little bit too soon rather than
 

4371
01:10:27,760 --> 01:10:29,510
maybe a little bit too soon rather than
a little bit too late

4372
01:10:29,510 --> 01:10:29,520
a little bit too late
 

4373
01:10:29,520 --> 01:10:31,590
a little bit too late
and with the case of gpt2 like i

4374
01:10:31,590 --> 01:10:31,600
and with the case of gpt2 like i
 

4375
01:10:31,600 --> 01:10:32,709
and with the case of gpt2 like i
mentioned earlier

4376
01:10:32,709 --> 01:10:32,719
mentioned earlier
 

4377
01:10:32,719 --> 01:10:35,510
mentioned earlier
the results really were stunning and it

4378
01:10:35,510 --> 01:10:35,520
the results really were stunning and it
 

4379
01:10:35,520 --> 01:10:36,550
the results really were stunning and it
seemed

4380
01:10:36,550 --> 01:10:36,560
seemed
 

4381
01:10:36,560 --> 01:10:38,709
seemed
plausible it didn't seem certain it

4382
01:10:38,709 --> 01:10:38,719
plausible it didn't seem certain it
 

4383
01:10:38,719 --> 01:10:40,229
plausible it didn't seem certain it
seemed plausible that

4384
01:10:40,229 --> 01:10:40,239
seemed plausible that
 

4385
01:10:40,239 --> 01:10:42,950
seemed plausible that
something like gpt2 could easily use to

4386
01:10:42,950 --> 01:10:42,960
something like gpt2 could easily use to
 

4387
01:10:42,960 --> 01:10:44,310
something like gpt2 could easily use to
reduce the cost of

4388
01:10:44,310 --> 01:10:44,320
reduce the cost of
 

4389
01:10:44,320 --> 01:10:47,590
reduce the cost of
this information and so

4390
01:10:47,590 --> 01:10:47,600
this information and so
 

4391
01:10:47,600 --> 01:10:49,189
this information and so
there was a question of what's the best

4392
01:10:49,189 --> 01:10:49,199
there was a question of what's the best
 

4393
01:10:49,199 --> 01:10:50,870
there was a question of what's the best
way to release it and staged release

4394
01:10:50,870 --> 01:10:50,880
way to release it and staged release
 

4395
01:10:50,880 --> 01:10:52,390
way to release it and staged release
seemed logical a small model was

4396
01:10:52,390 --> 01:10:52,400
seemed logical a small model was
 

4397
01:10:52,400 --> 01:10:53,669
seemed logical a small model was
released

4398
01:10:53,669 --> 01:10:53,679
released
 

4399
01:10:53,679 --> 01:10:57,350
released
and there was time to see the

4400
01:10:57,350 --> 01:10:57,360
and there was time to see the
 

4401
01:10:57,360 --> 01:10:58,870
and there was time to see the
many people use these models in lots of

4402
01:10:58,870 --> 01:10:58,880
many people use these models in lots of
 

4403
01:10:58,880 --> 01:11:00,310
many people use these models in lots of
cool ways they've been lots of really

4404
01:11:00,310 --> 01:11:00,320
cool ways they've been lots of really
 

4405
01:11:00,320 --> 01:11:01,910
cool ways they've been lots of really
cool applications

4406
01:11:01,910 --> 01:11:01,920
cool applications
 

4407
01:11:01,920 --> 01:11:04,390
cool applications
there haven't been any negative

4408
01:11:04,390 --> 01:11:04,400
there haven't been any negative
 

4409
01:11:04,400 --> 01:11:06,070
there haven't been any negative
applications we know of

4410
01:11:06,070 --> 01:11:06,080
applications we know of
 

4411
01:11:06,080 --> 01:11:07,669
applications we know of
and so eventually it was released but

4412
01:11:07,669 --> 01:11:07,679
and so eventually it was released but
 

4413
01:11:07,679 --> 01:11:09,189
and so eventually it was released but
also other people replicated similar

4414
01:11:09,189 --> 01:11:09,199
also other people replicated similar
 

4415
01:11:09,199 --> 01:11:09,830
also other people replicated similar
models

4416
01:11:09,830 --> 01:11:09,840
models
 

4417
01:11:09,840 --> 01:11:11,189
models
that's an interesting question though

4418
01:11:11,189 --> 01:11:11,199
that's an interesting question though
 

4419
01:11:11,199 --> 01:11:13,270
that's an interesting question though
that we know of so

4420
01:11:13,270 --> 01:11:13,280
that we know of so
 

4421
01:11:13,280 --> 01:11:16,310
that we know of so
in your view stage release is

4422
01:11:16,310 --> 01:11:16,320
in your view stage release is
 

4423
01:11:16,320 --> 01:11:19,110
in your view stage release is
uh at least part of the answer to the

4424
01:11:19,110 --> 01:11:19,120
uh at least part of the answer to the
 

4425
01:11:19,120 --> 01:11:22,390
uh at least part of the answer to the
question of how do we

4426
01:11:22,390 --> 01:11:22,400

 

4427
01:11:22,400 --> 01:11:24,630

uh how what do we do once we create a

4428
01:11:24,630 --> 01:11:24,640
uh how what do we do once we create a
 

4429
01:11:24,640 --> 01:11:26,790
uh how what do we do once we create a
system like this it's part of the answer

4430
01:11:26,790 --> 01:11:26,800
system like this it's part of the answer
 

4431
01:11:26,800 --> 01:11:28,310
system like this it's part of the answer
yes

4432
01:11:28,310 --> 01:11:28,320
yes
 

4433
01:11:28,320 --> 01:11:30,790
yes
is there any other insights like say you

4434
01:11:30,790 --> 01:11:30,800
is there any other insights like say you
 

4435
01:11:30,800 --> 01:11:32,310
is there any other insights like say you
don't want to release the model at all

4436
01:11:32,310 --> 01:11:32,320
don't want to release the model at all
 

4437
01:11:32,320 --> 01:11:34,709
don't want to release the model at all
because it's useful to you for whatever

4438
01:11:34,709 --> 01:11:34,719
because it's useful to you for whatever
 

4439
01:11:34,719 --> 01:11:35,669
because it's useful to you for whatever
the business is

4440
01:11:35,669 --> 01:11:35,679
the business is
 

4441
01:11:35,679 --> 01:11:37,430
the business is
well there are plenty plenty of people

4442
01:11:37,430 --> 01:11:37,440
well there are plenty plenty of people
 

4443
01:11:37,440 --> 01:11:39,030
well there are plenty plenty of people
don't release models already

4444
01:11:39,030 --> 01:11:39,040
don't release models already
 

4445
01:11:39,040 --> 01:11:42,149
don't release models already
right of course but is there some

4446
01:11:42,149 --> 01:11:42,159
right of course but is there some
 

4447
01:11:42,159 --> 01:11:44,709
right of course but is there some
moral ethical responsibility when you

4448
01:11:44,709 --> 01:11:44,719
moral ethical responsibility when you
 

4449
01:11:44,719 --> 01:11:46,870
moral ethical responsibility when you
have a very powerful model to sort of

4450
01:11:46,870 --> 01:11:46,880
have a very powerful model to sort of
 

4451
01:11:46,880 --> 01:11:50,149
have a very powerful model to sort of
communicate like just as you said

4452
01:11:50,149 --> 01:11:50,159
communicate like just as you said
 

4453
01:11:50,159 --> 01:11:52,470
communicate like just as you said
when you had gpt2 it was unclear how

4454
01:11:52,470 --> 01:11:52,480
when you had gpt2 it was unclear how
 

4455
01:11:52,480 --> 01:11:54,070
when you had gpt2 it was unclear how
much it could be used for misinformation

4456
01:11:54,070 --> 01:11:54,080
much it could be used for misinformation
 

4457
01:11:54,080 --> 01:11:56,790
much it could be used for misinformation
it's an open question and getting an

4458
01:11:56,790 --> 01:11:56,800
it's an open question and getting an
 

4459
01:11:56,800 --> 01:11:57,669
it's an open question and getting an
answer to that

4460
01:11:57,669 --> 01:11:57,679
answer to that
 

4461
01:11:57,679 --> 01:11:59,590
answer to that
might require that you talk to other

4462
01:11:59,590 --> 01:11:59,600
might require that you talk to other
 

4463
01:11:59,600 --> 01:12:01,430
might require that you talk to other
really smart people that are outside of

4464
01:12:01,430 --> 01:12:01,440
really smart people that are outside of
 

4465
01:12:01,440 --> 01:12:02,070
really smart people that are outside of
uh

4466
01:12:02,070 --> 01:12:02,080
uh
 

4467
01:12:02,080 --> 01:12:05,110
uh
outside your particular group

4468
01:12:05,110 --> 01:12:05,120
outside your particular group
 

4469
01:12:05,120 --> 01:12:07,189
outside your particular group
have you please tell me there's some

4470
01:12:07,189 --> 01:12:07,199
have you please tell me there's some
 

4471
01:12:07,199 --> 01:12:08,550
have you please tell me there's some
optimistic pathway

4472
01:12:08,550 --> 01:12:08,560
optimistic pathway
 

4473
01:12:08,560 --> 01:12:10,550
optimistic pathway
for people across the world to

4474
01:12:10,550 --> 01:12:10,560
for people across the world to
 

4475
01:12:10,560 --> 01:12:14,550
for people across the world to
collaborate on these kinds of cases

4476
01:12:14,550 --> 01:12:14,560

 

4477
01:12:14,560 --> 01:12:16,870

or is it still really difficult from

4478
01:12:16,870 --> 01:12:16,880
or is it still really difficult from
 

4479
01:12:16,880 --> 01:12:18,550
or is it still really difficult from
from one company to talk to another

4480
01:12:18,550 --> 01:12:18,560
from one company to talk to another
 

4481
01:12:18,560 --> 01:12:19,430
from one company to talk to another
company

4482
01:12:19,430 --> 01:12:19,440
company
 

4483
01:12:19,440 --> 01:12:21,350
company
so it's definitely possible it's

4484
01:12:21,350 --> 01:12:21,360
so it's definitely possible it's
 

4485
01:12:21,360 --> 01:12:22,870
so it's definitely possible it's
definitely possible to

4486
01:12:22,870 --> 01:12:22,880
definitely possible to
 

4487
01:12:22,880 --> 01:12:26,070
definitely possible to
discuss these kind of models

4488
01:12:26,070 --> 01:12:26,080
discuss these kind of models
 

4489
01:12:26,080 --> 01:12:29,189
discuss these kind of models
with colleagues elsewhere and to

4490
01:12:29,189 --> 01:12:29,199
with colleagues elsewhere and to
 

4491
01:12:29,199 --> 01:12:31,110
with colleagues elsewhere and to
get get their take on what's on what to

4492
01:12:31,110 --> 01:12:31,120
get get their take on what's on what to
 

4493
01:12:31,120 --> 01:12:33,590
get get their take on what's on what to
do how hard is it though

4494
01:12:33,590 --> 01:12:33,600
do how hard is it though
 

4495
01:12:33,600 --> 01:12:37,910
do how hard is it though
i mean do you see that happening

4496
01:12:37,910 --> 01:12:37,920
i mean do you see that happening
 

4497
01:12:37,920 --> 01:12:40,070
i mean do you see that happening
i think that's that's a place where it's

4498
01:12:40,070 --> 01:12:40,080
i think that's that's a place where it's
 

4499
01:12:40,080 --> 01:12:41,910
i think that's that's a place where it's
important to gradually build trust

4500
01:12:41,910 --> 01:12:41,920
important to gradually build trust
 

4501
01:12:41,920 --> 01:12:43,110
important to gradually build trust
between companies

4502
01:12:43,110 --> 01:12:43,120
between companies
 

4503
01:12:43,120 --> 01:12:46,950
between companies
because ultimately all the ai developers

4504
01:12:46,950 --> 01:12:46,960
because ultimately all the ai developers
 

4505
01:12:46,960 --> 01:12:48,470
because ultimately all the ai developers
are building technology which is bitcoin

4506
01:12:48,470 --> 01:12:48,480
are building technology which is bitcoin
 

4507
01:12:48,480 --> 01:12:50,709
are building technology which is bitcoin
to be increasingly more powerful

4508
01:12:50,709 --> 01:12:50,719
to be increasingly more powerful
 

4509
01:12:50,719 --> 01:12:54,550
to be increasingly more powerful
and so it's

4510
01:12:54,550 --> 01:12:54,560

 

4511
01:12:54,560 --> 01:12:55,750

the way to think about it is that

4512
01:12:55,750 --> 01:12:55,760
the way to think about it is that
 

4513
01:12:55,760 --> 01:12:58,550
the way to think about it is that
ultimately we're only together

4514
01:12:58,550 --> 01:12:58,560
ultimately we're only together
 

4515
01:12:58,560 --> 01:13:02,950
ultimately we're only together
yeah it's uh i tend to believe in the

4516
01:13:02,950 --> 01:13:02,960
yeah it's uh i tend to believe in the
 

4517
01:13:02,960 --> 01:13:04,790
yeah it's uh i tend to believe in the
the better angels of our nature but i do

4518
01:13:04,790 --> 01:13:04,800
the better angels of our nature but i do
 

4519
01:13:04,800 --> 01:13:06,149
the better angels of our nature but i do
hope

4520
01:13:06,149 --> 01:13:06,159
hope
 

4521
01:13:06,159 --> 01:13:10,229
hope
that um that when you build a really

4522
01:13:10,229 --> 01:13:10,239
that um that when you build a really
 

4523
01:13:10,239 --> 01:13:11,910
that um that when you build a really
powerful ai system in a particular

4524
01:13:11,910 --> 01:13:11,920
powerful ai system in a particular
 

4525
01:13:11,920 --> 01:13:12,709
powerful ai system in a particular
domain

4526
01:13:12,709 --> 01:13:12,719
domain
 

4527
01:13:12,719 --> 01:13:15,510
domain
that you also think about the potential

4528
01:13:15,510 --> 01:13:15,520
that you also think about the potential
 

4529
01:13:15,520 --> 01:13:22,229
that you also think about the potential
negative consequences of um

4530
01:13:22,229 --> 01:13:22,239

 

4531
01:13:22,239 --> 01:13:23,430

it's an interesting and scary

4532
01:13:23,430 --> 01:13:23,440
it's an interesting and scary
 

4533
01:13:23,440 --> 01:13:25,510
it's an interesting and scary
possibility that it'll be a race

4534
01:13:25,510 --> 01:13:25,520
possibility that it'll be a race
 

4535
01:13:25,520 --> 01:13:27,830
possibility that it'll be a race
for a ai development that would push

4536
01:13:27,830 --> 01:13:27,840
for a ai development that would push
 

4537
01:13:27,840 --> 01:13:29,030
for a ai development that would push
people to close

4538
01:13:29,030 --> 01:13:29,040
people to close
 

4539
01:13:29,040 --> 01:13:31,350
people to close
that development and not share ideas

4540
01:13:31,350 --> 01:13:31,360
that development and not share ideas
 

4541
01:13:31,360 --> 01:13:33,430
that development and not share ideas
with others

4542

what do you think it takes to let's talk
 

4551

what do you think it takes to build a
 

4555
01:13:45,920 --> 01:13:47,990
what do you think it takes to build a
system of human level intelligence we

4556
01:13:47,990 --> 01:13:48,000
system of human level intelligence we
 

4557
01:13:48,000 --> 01:13:49,430
system of human level intelligence we
talked about reasoning

4558
01:13:49,430 --> 01:13:49,440
talked about reasoning
 

4559
01:13:49,440 --> 01:13:51,750
talked about reasoning
we talked about long-term memory but in

4560

we talked about long-term memory but in
 

4561
01:13:51,760 --> 01:13:53,669
we talked about long-term memory but in
general what does it take you think

4562
01:13:53,669 --> 01:13:53,679
general what does it take you think
 

4563
01:13:53,679 --> 01:13:57,350
general what does it take you think
well i can't be sure

4564
01:13:57,350 --> 01:13:57,360
well i can't be sure
 

4565
01:13:57,360 --> 01:14:00,070
well i can't be sure
but i think the deep learning plus maybe

4566
01:14:00,070 --> 01:14:00,080
but i think the deep learning plus maybe
 

4567
01:14:00,080 --> 01:14:01,830
but i think the deep learning plus maybe
another

4568
01:14:01,830 --> 01:14:01,840
another
 

4569
01:14:01,840 --> 01:14:04,790
another
small idea do you think self-play will

4570
01:14:04,790 --> 01:14:04,800
small idea do you think self-play will
 

4571
01:14:04,800 --> 01:14:05,510
small idea do you think self-play will
be involved

4572
01:14:05,510 --> 01:14:05,520
be involved
 

4573
01:14:05,520 --> 01:14:07,830
be involved
so like you've spoken about the powerful

4574
01:14:07,830 --> 01:14:07,840
so like you've spoken about the powerful
 

4575
01:14:07,840 --> 01:14:09,830
so like you've spoken about the powerful
mechanism of self-play where

4576
01:14:09,830 --> 01:14:09,840
mechanism of self-play where
 

4577
01:14:09,840 --> 01:14:13,510
mechanism of self-play where
systems learn by sort of uh

4578
01:14:13,510 --> 01:14:13,520
systems learn by sort of uh
 

4579
01:14:13,520 --> 01:14:16,149
systems learn by sort of uh
exploring the world in a competitive

4580
01:14:16,149 --> 01:14:16,159
exploring the world in a competitive
 

4581
01:14:16,159 --> 01:14:17,350
exploring the world in a competitive
setting against

4582
01:14:17,350 --> 01:14:17,360
setting against
 

4583
01:14:17,360 --> 01:14:19,350
setting against
other entities that are similarly

4584
01:14:19,350 --> 01:14:19,360
other entities that are similarly
 

4585
01:14:19,360 --> 01:14:20,470
other entities that are similarly
skilled as them

4586
01:14:20,470 --> 01:14:20,480
skilled as them
 

4587
01:14:20,480 --> 01:14:22,950
skilled as them
and so incrementally improve in this way

4588
01:14:22,950 --> 01:14:22,960
and so incrementally improve in this way
 

4589
01:14:22,960 --> 01:14:23,990
and so incrementally improve in this way
do you think self-play will be a

4590
01:14:23,990 --> 01:14:24,000
do you think self-play will be a
 

4591
01:14:24,000 --> 01:14:25,030
do you think self-play will be a
component of

4592
01:14:25,030 --> 01:14:25,040
component of
 

4593
01:14:25,040 --> 01:14:28,470
component of
building an agi system yeah so what i

4594
01:14:28,470 --> 01:14:28,480
building an agi system yeah so what i
 

4595
01:14:28,480 --> 01:14:29,110
building an agi system yeah so what i
would say

4596
01:14:29,110 --> 01:14:29,120
would say
 

4597
01:14:29,120 --> 01:14:32,470
would say
to build agi i think is going to be

4598
01:14:32,470 --> 01:14:32,480
to build agi i think is going to be
 

4599
01:14:32,480 --> 01:14:35,189
to build agi i think is going to be
deep learning plus some ideas and i

4600
01:14:35,189 --> 01:14:35,199
deep learning plus some ideas and i
 

4601
01:14:35,199 --> 01:14:36,709
deep learning plus some ideas and i
think self-play will be one of those

4602
01:14:36,709 --> 01:14:36,719
think self-play will be one of those
 

4603
01:14:36,719 --> 01:14:38,550
think self-play will be one of those
ideas

4604
01:14:38,550 --> 01:14:38,560
ideas
 

4605
01:14:38,560 --> 01:14:42,229
ideas
i think that that is a very

4606
01:14:42,229 --> 01:14:42,239
i think that that is a very
 

4607
01:14:42,239 --> 01:14:44,950
i think that that is a very
self play has this amazing property that

4608
01:14:44,950 --> 01:14:44,960
self play has this amazing property that
 

4609
01:14:44,960 --> 01:14:47,990
self play has this amazing property that
it can surprise us

4610
01:14:47,990 --> 01:14:48,000
it can surprise us
 

4611
01:14:48,000 --> 01:14:52,070
it can surprise us
in truly novel ways for example

4612
01:14:52,070 --> 01:14:52,080
in truly novel ways for example
 

4613
01:14:52,080 --> 01:14:54,630
in truly novel ways for example
like we i mean pretty much every

4614
01:14:54,630 --> 01:14:54,640
like we i mean pretty much every
 

4615
01:14:54,640 --> 01:14:56,550
like we i mean pretty much every
self-play system

4616
01:14:56,550 --> 01:14:56,560
self-play system
 

4617
01:14:56,560 --> 01:14:59,669
self-play system
both are dotabot i don't know if openai

4618
01:14:59,669 --> 01:14:59,679
both are dotabot i don't know if openai
 

4619
01:14:59,679 --> 01:15:01,750
both are dotabot i don't know if openai
had a release about

4620
01:15:01,750 --> 01:15:01,760
had a release about
 

4621
01:15:01,760 --> 01:15:03,910
had a release about
multi-agent where you had two little

4622
01:15:03,910 --> 01:15:03,920
multi-agent where you had two little
 

4623
01:15:03,920 --> 01:15:06,070
multi-agent where you had two little
agents who were playing hide and seek

4624
01:15:06,070 --> 01:15:06,080
agents who were playing hide and seek
 

4625
01:15:06,080 --> 01:15:08,550
agents who were playing hide and seek
and of course also alpha zero they were

4626
01:15:08,550 --> 01:15:08,560
and of course also alpha zero they were
 

4627
01:15:08,560 --> 01:15:09,189
and of course also alpha zero they were
all

4628
01:15:09,189 --> 01:15:09,199
all
 

4629
01:15:09,199 --> 01:15:11,590
all
surprising behaviors they all produce

4630
01:15:11,590 --> 01:15:11,600
surprising behaviors they all produce
 

4631
01:15:11,600 --> 01:15:13,510
surprising behaviors they all produce
behaviors that we didn't expect they are

4632
01:15:13,510 --> 01:15:13,520
behaviors that we didn't expect they are
 

4633
01:15:13,520 --> 01:15:15,830
behaviors that we didn't expect they are
creative solutions to problems

4634
01:15:15,830 --> 01:15:15,840
creative solutions to problems
 

4635
01:15:15,840 --> 01:15:18,149
creative solutions to problems
and that seems like an important part of

4636
01:15:18,149 --> 01:15:18,159
and that seems like an important part of
 

4637
01:15:18,159 --> 01:15:20,070
and that seems like an important part of
agi that our systems don't exhibit

4638
01:15:20,070 --> 01:15:20,080
agi that our systems don't exhibit
 

4639
01:15:20,080 --> 01:15:22,070
agi that our systems don't exhibit
routinely right now

4640
01:15:22,070 --> 01:15:22,080
routinely right now
 

4641
01:15:22,080 --> 01:15:24,870
routinely right now
and so that's why i like this area i

4642
01:15:24,870 --> 01:15:24,880
and so that's why i like this area i
 

4643
01:15:24,880 --> 01:15:26,149
and so that's why i like this area i
like this direction because of its

4644
01:15:26,149 --> 01:15:26,159
like this direction because of its
 

4645
01:15:26,159 --> 01:15:27,430
like this direction because of its
ability to surprise us

4646
01:15:27,430 --> 01:15:27,440
ability to surprise us
 

4647
01:15:27,440 --> 01:15:30,070
ability to surprise us
to surprise us and an agr system would

4648
01:15:30,070 --> 01:15:30,080
to surprise us and an agr system would
 

4649
01:15:30,080 --> 01:15:31,990
to surprise us and an agr system would
surprise us fundamentally yes but and to

not just a random surprise but to find a
 

4655
01:15:36,000 --> 01:15:37,990
not just a random surprise but to find a
surprising solution to a problem that's

01:15:37,990 --> 01:15:38,000
surprising solution to a problem that's
 

4657
01:15:38,000 --> 01:15:39,030
surprising solution to a problem that's
also useful

4658
01:15:39,030 --> 01:15:39,040
also useful
 

4659
01:15:39,040 --> 01:15:41,990
also useful
right now a lot of the self-play

4660
01:15:41,990 --> 01:15:42,000
right now a lot of the self-play
 

4661

simulation is a tool
 

4693
01:16:16,800 --> 01:16:18,550
simulation is a tool
and it helps it has certain strengths

and it helps it has certain strengths
 

4695
01:16:18,560 --> 01:16:20,630
and it helps it has certain strengths
and certain weaknesses and we should

and certain weaknesses and we should
 

4697
01:16:20,640 --> 01:16:24,390
and certain weaknesses and we should
use it yeah but okay i understand that

4698
01:16:24,390 --> 01:16:24,400
use it yeah but okay i understand that
 

4699
01:16:24,400 --> 01:16:27,830
use it yeah but okay i understand that
that's um

4727
01:16:53,199 --> 01:16:55,669
environments
or do you think it's possible to also

4728
01:16:55,669 --> 01:16:55,679
or do you think it's possible to also
 

4729
01:16:55,679 --> 01:16:56,390
or do you think it's possible to also
just

4730
01:16:56,390 --> 01:16:56,400
just
 

4731
01:16:56,400 --> 01:16:59,590
just
simulate in the photorealistic and

4732
01:16:59,590 --> 01:16:59,600
simulate in the photorealistic and
 

4733
01:16:59,600 --> 01:17:01,830
simulate in the photorealistic and
physics realistic way the real world in

4734
01:17:01,830 --> 01:17:01,840
physics realistic way the real world in
 

4735
01:17:01,840 --> 01:17:03,669
physics realistic way the real world in
a way that we can solve real problems

4736
01:17:03,669 --> 01:17:03,679
a way that we can solve real problems
 

4737
01:17:03,679 --> 01:17:05,270
a way that we can solve real problems
with self-play

4738
01:17:05,270 --> 01:17:05,280
with self-play
 

4739
01:17:05,280 --> 01:17:08,390
with self-play
in simulation so i think that

4740
01:17:08,390 --> 01:17:08,400
in simulation so i think that
 

4741
01:17:08,400 --> 01:17:09,990
in simulation so i think that
transfer from simulation to the real

4742
01:17:09,990 --> 01:17:10,000
transfer from simulation to the real
 

4743
01:17:10,000 --> 01:17:11,590
transfer from simulation to the real
world is definitely possible

4744
01:17:11,590 --> 01:17:11,600
world is definitely possible
 

4745
01:17:11,600 --> 01:17:14,229
world is definitely possible

and the policy that was learned in

4778
01:17:46,229 --> 01:17:46,239
and the policy that was learned in
 

4779
01:17:46,239 --> 01:17:47,830
and the policy that was learned in
simulation was trained to be very

4780
01:17:47,830 --> 01:17:47,840
simulation was trained to be very
 

4781
01:17:47,840 --> 01:17:48,950
simulation was trained to be very
adaptive

4782
01:17:48,950 --> 01:17:48,960
adaptive
 

4783
01:17:48,960 --> 01:17:50,950
adaptive
so adaptive that when you transfer it

4784
01:17:50,950 --> 01:17:50,960
so adaptive that when you transfer it
 

4785
01:17:50,960 --> 01:17:52,790
so adaptive that when you transfer it
could very quickly adapt to the physical

4786
01:17:52,790 --> 01:17:52,800
could very quickly adapt to the physical
 

4787
01:17:52,800 --> 01:17:54,470
could very quickly adapt to the physical
to the physical world so the kind of

4788
01:17:54,470 --> 01:17:54,480
to the physical world so the kind of
 

4789
01:17:54,480 --> 01:17:56,790
to the physical world so the kind of
perturbations with the

4790
01:17:56,790 --> 01:17:56,800
perturbations with the
 

4791
01:17:56,800 --> 01:17:58,790
perturbations with the
giraffe or whatever the heck it was

4792
01:17:58,790 --> 01:17:58,800
giraffe or whatever the heck it was
 

4793
01:17:58,800 --> 01:18:00,790
giraffe or whatever the heck it was
those weren't were those part of the

4794
01:18:00,790 --> 01:18:00,800
those weren't were those part of the
 

4795
01:18:00,800 --> 01:18:02,870
those weren't were those part of the
simulation well the simulation was

4796
01:18:02,870 --> 01:18:02,880
simulation well the simulation was
 

4797
01:18:02,880 --> 01:18:03,990
simulation well the simulation was
generally

4798
01:18:03,990 --> 01:18:04,000
generally
 

4799
01:18:04,000 --> 01:18:06,390
generally
so the simulation was trained to be

4800
01:18:06,390 --> 01:18:06,400
so the simulation was trained to be
 

4801
01:18:06,400 --> 01:18:08,390
so the simulation was trained to be
robust to many different things but not

4802
01:18:08,390 --> 01:18:08,400
robust to many different things but not
 

4803
01:18:08,400 --> 01:18:10,070
robust to many different things but not
the kind of perturbations we've had in

4804
01:18:10,070 --> 01:18:10,080
the kind of perturbations we've had in
 

4805
01:18:10,080 --> 01:18:11,189
the kind of perturbations we've had in
the video so

4806
01:18:11,189 --> 01:18:11,199
the video so
 

4807
01:18:11,199 --> 01:18:12,550
the video so
it's never been trained with a glove

4808
01:18:12,550 --> 01:18:12,560
it's never been trained with a glove
 

4809
01:18:12,560 --> 01:18:16,070
it's never been trained with a glove
it's never been trained with a

01:18:16,070 --> 01:18:16,080
it's never been trained with a
 

4811
01:18:16,080 --> 01:18:18,149
it's never been trained with a
stuffed giraffe so in theory these are

4812
01:18:18,149 --> 01:18:18,159
stuffed giraffe so in theory these are
 

4813
01:18:18,159 --> 01:18:19,669
stuffed giraffe so in theory these are
novel perturbations correct

4814
01:18:19,669 --> 01:18:19,679
novel perturbations correct
 

4815
01:18:19,679 --> 01:18:21,830
novel perturbations correct
it's not in theory in practice that

4816
01:18:21,830 --> 01:18:21,840
it's not in theory in practice that
 

4817
01:18:21,840 --> 01:18:23,110
it's not in theory in practice that
those are novel

4818
01:18:23,110 --> 01:18:23,120
those are novel
 

4819
01:18:23,120 --> 01:18:26,310
those are novel
probation well that's okay

4820
01:18:26,310 --> 01:18:26,320
probation well that's okay
 

4821
01:18:26,320 --> 01:18:28,870
probation well that's okay
that's a clean small scale but clean

4822
01:18:28,870 --> 01:18:28,880
that's a clean small scale but clean
 

4823
01:18:28,880 --> 01:18:30,470
that's a clean small scale but clean

yeah and i will also say that i expect

4828
01:18:34,149 --> 01:18:34,159
yeah and i will also say that i expect
 

4829
01:18:34,159 --> 01:18:35,830
yeah and i will also say that i expect
the transfer capabilities of deep

4830
01:18:35,830 --> 01:18:35,840
the transfer capabilities of deep
 

4831
01:18:35,840 --> 01:18:36,870
the transfer capabilities of deep
learning to increase

4832
01:18:36,870 --> 01:18:36,880
learning to increase
 

4833
01:18:36,880 --> 01:18:39,110
learning to increase
in general and the better the transfer

4834
01:18:39,110 --> 01:18:39,120
in general and the better the transfer
 

4835
01:18:39,120 --> 01:18:40,390
in general and the better the transfer
capabilities are

4836
01:18:40,390 --> 01:18:40,400
capabilities are
 

4837
01:18:40,400 --> 01:18:43,510
capabilities are
the more useful simulation will become

4838
01:18:43,510 --> 01:18:43,520
the more useful simulation will become
 

4839
01:18:43,520 --> 01:18:46,229
the more useful simulation will become
because then you could take you could

4840
01:18:46,229 --> 01:18:46,239
because then you could take you could
 

4841
01:18:46,239 --> 01:18:48,390
because then you could take you could
experience something in simulation

4842
01:18:48,390 --> 01:18:48,400
experience something in simulation
 

4843
01:18:48,400 --> 01:18:50,149
experience something in simulation
and then learn a moral of the story

4844
01:18:50,149 --> 01:18:50,159
and then learn a moral of the story
 

4845
01:18:50,159 --> 01:18:51,669
and then learn a moral of the story
which you could then carry with you to

4846
01:18:51,669 --> 01:18:51,679
which you could then carry with you to
 

4847
01:18:51,679 --> 01:18:52,470
which you could then carry with you to

do you think aj asks us that we need to
have a body we need to have some of

01:19:08,390 --> 01:19:08,400
have a body we need to have some of
 

4863
01:19:08,400 --> 01:19:10,790

in the physical space
 

4871
01:19:18,000 --> 01:19:20,630
in the physical space
which comes with having a body i think

4872
01:19:20,630 --> 01:19:20,640
which comes with having a body i think
 

4873
01:19:20,640 --> 01:19:22,310
which comes with having a body i think
having a body will be useful

4874
01:19:22,310 --> 01:19:22,320
having a body will be useful
 

4875
01:19:22,320 --> 01:19:24,550
having a body will be useful
i don't think it's necessary but i think

4876
01:19:24,550 --> 01:19:24,560
i don't think it's necessary but i think
 

4877
01:19:24,560 --> 01:19:26,149
i don't think it's necessary but i think
it's very useful to have a body for sure

4878
01:19:26,149 --> 01:19:26,159
it's very useful to have a body for sure
 

4879
01:19:26,159 --> 01:19:27,990
it's very useful to have a body for sure
because you can learn

4880
01:19:27,990 --> 01:19:28,000
because you can learn
 

4881
01:19:28,000 --> 01:19:29,990
because you can learn
a whole new you you can learn things

4882
01:19:29,990 --> 01:19:30,000
a whole new you you can learn things
 

4883
01:19:30,000 --> 01:19:32,390
a whole new you you can learn things
which cannot be learned without a body

4884
01:19:32,390 --> 01:19:32,400
which cannot be learned without a body
 

4885
01:19:32,400 --> 01:19:34,070
which cannot be learned without a body
but at the same time i think that you

4886
01:19:34,070 --> 01:19:34,080
but at the same time i think that you
 

4887
01:19:34,080 --> 01:19:35,990
but at the same time i think that you
can if you don't have a body you could

4888
01:19:35,990 --> 01:19:36,000
can if you don't have a body you could
 

4889
01:19:36,000 --> 01:19:38,550
can if you don't have a body you could
compensate for it and still succeed you

4890
01:19:38,550 --> 01:19:38,560
compensate for it and still succeed you
 

4891
01:19:38,560 --> 01:19:39,270
compensate for it and still succeed you
think so

4892
01:19:39,270 --> 01:19:39,280
think so
 

4893
01:19:39,280 --> 01:19:40,790
think so
yes well if there is evidence for this

4894
01:19:40,790 --> 01:19:40,800
yes well if there is evidence for this
 

4895
01:19:40,800 --> 01:19:42,390
yes well if there is evidence for this
for example there are many people who

4896
01:19:42,390 --> 01:19:42,400
for example there are many people who
 

4897
01:19:42,400 --> 01:19:43,750
for example there are many people who
were born deaf and

4898
01:19:43,750 --> 01:19:43,760
were born deaf and
 

4899
01:19:43,760 --> 01:19:46,470
were born deaf and
blind and they were able to compensate

4900
01:19:46,470 --> 01:19:46,480
blind and they were able to compensate
 

4901
01:19:46,480 --> 01:19:47,350
blind and they were able to compensate
for the lack of

4902
01:19:47,350 --> 01:19:47,360
for the lack of
 

4903
01:19:47,360 --> 01:19:49,110
for the lack of
modalities i'm thinking about helen

4904
01:19:49,110 --> 01:19:49,120
modalities i'm thinking about helen
 

4905
01:19:49,120 --> 01:19:51,430
modalities i'm thinking about helen
keller specifically

4906
01:19:51,430 --> 01:19:51,440
keller specifically
 

4907
01:19:51,440 --> 01:19:53,270
keller specifically
so even if you're not able to physically

4908
01:19:53,270 --> 01:19:53,280
so even if you're not able to physically
 

4909
01:19:53,280 --> 01:19:54,709
so even if you're not able to physically
interact with the world

4910
01:19:54,709 --> 01:19:54,719
interact with the world
 

4911
01:19:54,719 --> 01:19:57,189
interact with the world
and if you're not able to i mean i

4912
01:19:57,189 --> 01:19:57,199
and if you're not able to i mean i
 

4913
01:19:57,199 --> 01:19:57,830
and if you're not able to i mean i
actually was

4914
01:19:57,830 --> 01:19:57,840
actually was
 

4915
01:19:57,840 --> 01:20:01,350
actually was
getting it maybe let me ask

4916
01:20:01,350 --> 01:20:01,360
getting it maybe let me ask
 

4917
01:20:01,360 --> 01:20:03,189
getting it maybe let me ask
on the more particular i'm not sure if

4918
01:20:03,189 --> 01:20:03,199
on the more particular i'm not sure if
 

4919
01:20:03,199 --> 01:20:05,270
on the more particular i'm not sure if
it's connected to having a body or not

4920
01:20:05,270 --> 01:20:05,280
it's connected to having a body or not
 

4921
01:20:05,280 --> 01:20:05,750
it's connected to having a body or not
but

4922
01:20:05,750 --> 01:20:05,760
but
 

4923
01:20:05,760 --> 01:20:08,629
but
the idea of consciousness and a more

4924
01:20:08,629 --> 01:20:08,639
the idea of consciousness and a more
 

4925
01:20:08,639 --> 01:20:09,830
the idea of consciousness and a more
constrained version of that is

4926
01:20:09,830 --> 01:20:09,840
constrained version of that is
 

4927
01:20:09,840 --> 01:20:11,110
constrained version of that is
self-awareness

4928
01:20:11,110 --> 01:20:11,120
self-awareness
 

4929
01:20:11,120 --> 01:20:13,510
self-awareness
do you think an egi system should have

4930
01:20:13,510 --> 01:20:13,520
do you think an egi system should have
 

4931
01:20:13,520 --> 01:20:15,510
do you think an egi system should have
consciousness

4932
01:20:15,510 --> 01:20:15,520
consciousness
 

4933
01:20:15,520 --> 01:20:17,270
consciousness
it's what we can't define kind of

4934
01:20:17,270 --> 01:20:17,280
it's what we can't define kind of
 

4935
01:20:17,280 --> 01:20:18,310
it's what we can't define kind of
whatever the heck you think

4936
01:20:18,310 --> 01:20:18,320
whatever the heck you think
 

4937
01:20:18,320 --> 01:20:19,430
whatever the heck you think
consciousness is

4938
01:20:19,430 --> 01:20:19,440
consciousness is
 

4939
01:20:19,440 --> 01:20:21,910
consciousness is
yeah hard question to answer given how

4940
01:20:21,910 --> 01:20:21,920
yeah hard question to answer given how
 

4941
01:20:21,920 --> 01:20:24,629
yeah hard question to answer given how
hard it is to find it

4942
01:20:24,629 --> 01:20:24,639
hard it is to find it
 

4943
01:20:24,639 --> 01:20:26,310
hard it is to find it
do you think it's useful to think about

4944
01:20:26,310 --> 01:20:26,320
do you think it's useful to think about
 

4945
01:20:26,320 --> 01:20:28,229
do you think it's useful to think about
i mean it's it's definitely interesting

4946
01:20:28,229 --> 01:20:28,239
i mean it's it's definitely interesting
 

4947
01:20:28,239 --> 01:20:31,350
i mean it's it's definitely interesting
it's fascinating i think it's definitely

4948
01:20:31,350 --> 01:20:31,360
it's fascinating i think it's definitely
 

4949
01:20:31,360 --> 01:20:32,550
it's fascinating i think it's definitely
possible that our assistants will be

4950
01:20:32,550 --> 01:20:32,560
possible that our assistants will be
 

4951
01:20:32,560 --> 01:20:33,750
possible that our assistants will be
conscious

4952
01:20:33,750 --> 01:20:33,760
conscious
 

4953
01:20:33,760 --> 01:20:34,950
conscious
do you think that's an emergent thing

4954
01:20:34,950 --> 01:20:34,960
do you think that's an emergent thing
 

4955
01:20:34,960 --> 01:20:36,629
do you think that's an emergent thing
that just comes from do you think

4956
01:20:36,629 --> 01:20:36,639
that just comes from do you think
 

4957
01:20:36,639 --> 01:20:37,990
that just comes from do you think
consciousness could emerge from the

4958
01:20:37,990 --> 01:20:38,000
consciousness could emerge from the
 

4959
01:20:38,000 --> 01:20:39,189
consciousness could emerge from the
representation that's

4960
01:20:39,189 --> 01:20:39,199
representation that's
 

4961
01:20:39,199 --> 01:20:41,590
representation that's
stored within your networks so like that

4962
01:20:41,590 --> 01:20:41,600
stored within your networks so like that
 

4963
01:20:41,600 --> 01:20:43,110
stored within your networks so like that
it naturally just emerges when you

4964
01:20:43,110 --> 01:20:43,120
it naturally just emerges when you
 

4965
01:20:43,120 --> 01:20:43,830
it naturally just emerges when you
become

4966
01:20:43,830 --> 01:20:43,840
become
 

4967
01:20:43,840 --> 01:20:45,830
become
more and more you're able to represent

4968
01:20:45,830 --> 01:20:45,840
more and more you're able to represent
 

4969
01:20:45,840 --> 01:20:46,950
more and more you're able to represent
more and more of the world

4970
01:20:46,950 --> 01:20:46,960
more and more of the world
 

4971
01:20:46,960 --> 01:20:48,310
more and more of the world
well i'd say i'd make the following

4972
01:20:48,310 --> 01:20:48,320
well i'd say i'd make the following
 

4973
01:20:48,320 --> 01:20:51,030
well i'd say i'd make the following
argument which is

4974
01:20:51,030 --> 01:20:51,040
argument which is
 

4975
01:20:51,040 --> 01:20:54,550
argument which is
humans are conscious and if you believe

4976
01:20:54,550 --> 01:20:54,560
humans are conscious and if you believe
 

4977
01:20:54,560 --> 01:20:54,950
humans are conscious and if you believe
that

4978
01:20:54,950 --> 01:20:54,960
that
 

4979
01:20:54,960 --> 01:20:57,830
that
artificial neural nets are sufficiently

4980
01:20:57,830 --> 01:20:57,840
artificial neural nets are sufficiently
 

4981
01:20:57,840 --> 01:20:59,510
artificial neural nets are sufficiently
similar to the brain

4982
01:20:59,510 --> 01:20:59,520
similar to the brain
 

4983
01:20:59,520 --> 01:21:01,750
similar to the brain
then there should at least exist

4984
01:21:01,750 --> 01:21:01,760
then there should at least exist
 

4985
01:21:01,760 --> 01:21:02,870
then there should at least exist
artificial neurons you should be

4986
01:21:02,870 --> 01:21:02,880
artificial neurons you should be
 

4987
01:21:02,880 --> 01:21:04,229
artificial neurons you should be
conscious too

4988
01:21:04,229 --> 01:21:04,239
conscious too
 

4989
01:21:04,239 --> 01:21:05,830
conscious too
you're leaning on that existence proof

4990
01:21:05,830 --> 01:21:05,840
you're leaning on that existence proof
 

4991
01:21:05,840 --> 01:21:08,629
you're leaning on that existence proof
pretty heavily okay

4992
01:21:08,629 --> 01:21:08,639
pretty heavily okay
 

4993
01:21:08,639 --> 01:21:10,709
pretty heavily okay
but it's it's just that that's that's

4994
01:21:10,709 --> 01:21:10,719
but it's it's just that that's that's
 

4995
01:21:10,719 --> 01:21:12,070
but it's it's just that that's that's
the best answer i can give

4996
01:21:12,070 --> 01:21:12,080
the best answer i can give
 

4997
01:21:12,080 --> 01:21:15,350
the best answer i can give
no i i know i know i know

4998
01:21:15,350 --> 01:21:15,360
no i i know i know i know
 

4999
01:21:15,360 --> 01:21:17,110
no i i know i know i know
uh there's still an open question if

5000
01:21:17,110 --> 01:21:17,120
uh there's still an open question if
 

5001
01:21:17,120 --> 01:21:19,110
uh there's still an open question if
there's not some magic in the brain

5002
01:21:19,110 --> 01:21:19,120
there's not some magic in the brain
 

5003
01:21:19,120 --> 01:21:21,830
there's not some magic in the brain
that we're not i mean i don't mean a

5004
01:21:21,830 --> 01:21:21,840
that we're not i mean i don't mean a
 

5005
01:21:21,840 --> 01:21:23,110
that we're not i mean i don't mean a
non-materialistic

5006
01:21:23,110 --> 01:21:23,120
non-materialistic
 

5007
01:21:23,120 --> 01:21:26,629
non-materialistic
magic but that um that the brain might

5008
01:21:26,629 --> 01:21:26,639
magic but that um that the brain might
 

5009
01:21:26,639 --> 01:21:27,830
magic but that um that the brain might
be a lot more complicated and

5010
01:21:27,830 --> 01:21:27,840
be a lot more complicated and
 

5011
01:21:27,840 --> 01:21:29,830
be a lot more complicated and
interesting that we give it credit for

5012
01:21:29,830 --> 01:21:29,840
interesting that we give it credit for
 

5013
01:21:29,840 --> 01:21:31,430
interesting that we give it credit for
if that's the case then it should show

5014
01:21:31,430 --> 01:21:31,440
if that's the case then it should show
 

5015
01:21:31,440 --> 01:21:33,510
if that's the case then it should show
up and at some point

5016
01:21:33,510 --> 01:21:33,520
up and at some point
 

5017
01:21:33,520 --> 01:21:35,189
up and at some point
at some point we will find out that we

5018
01:21:35,189 --> 01:21:35,199
at some point we will find out that we
 

5019
01:21:35,199 --> 01:21:36,709
at some point we will find out that we
can't continue to make progress but i

5020
01:21:36,709 --> 01:21:36,719
can't continue to make progress but i
 

5021
01:21:36,719 --> 01:21:37,030
can't continue to make progress but i
think

5022
01:21:37,030 --> 01:21:37,040
think
 

5023
01:21:37,040 --> 01:21:39,430
think
i think it's unlikely so we talk about

5024
01:21:39,430 --> 01:21:39,440
i think it's unlikely so we talk about
 

5025
01:21:39,440 --> 01:21:40,790
i think it's unlikely so we talk about
consciousness but let me talk about

5026
01:21:40,790 --> 01:21:40,800
consciousness but let me talk about
 

5027
01:21:40,800 --> 01:21:42,470
consciousness but let me talk about
another poorly defined concept of

5028
01:21:42,470 --> 01:21:42,480
another poorly defined concept of
 

5029
01:21:42,480 --> 01:21:44,550
another poorly defined concept of

5030
01:21:44,550 --> 01:21:44,560
intelligence
 

5031
01:21:44,560 --> 01:21:46,870
intelligence
again we've talked about reasoning we've

5032
01:21:46,870 --> 01:21:46,880
again we've talked about reasoning we've
 

5033
01:21:46,880 --> 01:21:47,910
again we've talked about reasoning we've
talked about memory

5034
01:21:47,910 --> 01:21:47,920
talked about memory
 

5035
01:21:47,920 --> 01:21:49,830
talked about memory
what do you think is a good test of

5036
01:21:49,830 --> 01:21:49,840
what do you think is a good test of
 

5037
01:21:49,840 --> 01:21:51,510
what do you think is a good test of
intelligence for you

5038

in your mind that you will be deeply

5048
01:22:03,270 --> 01:22:03,280
in your mind that you will be deeply
 

5049
01:22:03,280 --> 01:22:04,149
in your mind that you will be deeply
impressed by

5050
01:22:04,149 --> 01:22:04,159
impressed by
 

5051
01:22:04,159 --> 01:22:06,870
impressed by
if a system was able to do i mean lots

5052
01:22:06,870 --> 01:22:06,880
if a system was able to do i mean lots
 

5053
01:22:06,880 --> 01:22:07,830
if a system was able to do i mean lots
of things

5054
01:22:07,830 --> 01:22:07,840
of things
 

5055
01:22:07,840 --> 01:22:09,110
of things
there's certain there's certain

5056
01:22:09,110 --> 01:22:09,120
there's certain there's certain
 

5057
01:22:09,120 --> 01:22:10,629
there's certain there's certain
frontiers there is a certain frontier of

5058
01:22:10,629 --> 01:22:10,639
frontiers there is a certain frontier of
 

5059
01:22:10,639 --> 01:22:12,390
frontiers there is a certain frontier of
capabilities today

5060
01:22:12,390 --> 01:22:12,400
capabilities today
 

5061
01:22:12,400 --> 01:22:15,830
capabilities today
yeah and there exists things outside of

5062
01:22:15,830 --> 01:22:15,840
yeah and there exists things outside of
 

5063
01:22:15,840 --> 01:22:16,790
yeah and there exists things outside of
that frontier

5064
01:22:16,790 --> 01:22:16,800
that frontier
 

5065
01:22:16,800 --> 01:22:18,229
that frontier
and i would be impressed by any such

5066
01:22:18,229 --> 01:22:18,239
and i would be impressed by any such
 

5067
01:22:18,239 --> 01:22:20,229
and i would be impressed by any such
thing for example

5068
01:22:20,229 --> 01:22:20,239
thing for example
 

5069
01:22:20,239 --> 01:22:23,189
thing for example
i would be impressed by a deep learning

5070
01:22:23,189 --> 01:22:23,199
i would be impressed by a deep learning
 

5071
01:22:23,199 --> 01:22:24,470
i would be impressed by a deep learning
system

5072
01:22:24,470 --> 01:22:24,480
system
 

5073
01:22:24,480 --> 01:22:26,229
system
which solves a very pedestrian you know

5074
01:22:26,229 --> 01:22:26,239
which solves a very pedestrian you know
 

5075
01:22:26,239 --> 01:22:28,149
which solves a very pedestrian you know
pedestrian task like machine translation

5076
01:22:28,149 --> 01:22:28,159
pedestrian task like machine translation
 

5077
01:22:28,159 --> 01:22:30,070
pedestrian task like machine translation
or computer vision task or

5078
01:22:30,070 --> 01:22:30,080
or computer vision task or
 

5079
01:22:30,080 --> 01:22:33,189
or computer vision task or
something which never makes mistake

5080
01:22:33,189 --> 01:22:33,199
something which never makes mistake
 

5081
01:22:33,199 --> 01:22:35,430
something which never makes mistake
a human wouldn't make under any

5082
01:22:35,430 --> 01:22:35,440
a human wouldn't make under any
 

5083
01:22:35,440 --> 01:22:37,110
a human wouldn't make under any
circumstances

5084
01:22:37,110 --> 01:22:37,120
circumstances
 

5085
01:22:37,120 --> 01:22:38,950
circumstances
i think that is something which have not

5086
01:22:38,950 --> 01:22:38,960
i think that is something which have not
 

5087
01:22:38,960 --> 01:22:40,470
i think that is something which have not
yet been demonstrated and i would find

5088
01:22:40,470 --> 01:22:40,480
yet been demonstrated and i would find
 

5089
01:22:40,480 --> 01:22:41,110
yet been demonstrated and i would find
it very

5090
01:22:41,110 --> 01:22:41,120
it very
 

5091
01:22:41,120 --> 01:22:43,830
it very
impressive yeah so right now they make

5092
01:22:43,830 --> 01:22:43,840
impressive yeah so right now they make
 

5093
01:22:43,840 --> 01:22:44,790
impressive yeah so right now they make
mistakes and differ

5094
01:22:44,790 --> 01:22:44,800
mistakes and differ
 

5095
01:22:44,800 --> 01:22:46,229
mistakes and differ
they might be more accurate than human

5096
01:22:46,229 --> 01:22:46,239
they might be more accurate than human
 

5097
01:22:46,239 --> 01:22:47,830
they might be more accurate than human
beings but they still they make a

5098
01:22:47,830 --> 01:22:47,840
beings but they still they make a
 

5099
01:22:47,840 --> 01:22:49,030
beings but they still they make a
different set of mistakes

5100
01:22:49,030 --> 01:22:49,040
different set of mistakes
 

5101
01:22:49,040 --> 01:22:52,550
different set of mistakes
so my my i would guess that a lot of the

5102
01:22:52,550 --> 01:22:52,560
so my my i would guess that a lot of the
 

5103
01:22:52,560 --> 01:22:54,629
so my my i would guess that a lot of the
skepticism that some people have about

5104
01:22:54,629 --> 01:22:54,639
skepticism that some people have about
 

5105
01:22:54,639 --> 01:22:55,669
skepticism that some people have about
deep learning

5106
01:22:55,669 --> 01:22:55,679
deep learning
 

5107
01:22:55,679 --> 01:22:57,030
deep learning
is when they look at their mistakes and

5108
01:22:57,030 --> 01:22:57,040
is when they look at their mistakes and
 

5109
01:22:57,040 --> 01:22:59,189
is when they look at their mistakes and
they say well those mistakes

5110
01:22:59,189 --> 01:22:59,199
they say well those mistakes
 

5111
01:22:59,199 --> 01:23:00,550
they say well those mistakes
they make no sense like if you

5112
01:23:00,550 --> 01:23:00,560
they make no sense like if you
 

5113
01:23:00,560 --> 01:23:01,990
they make no sense like if you
understood the concept you wouldn't make

5114
01:23:01,990 --> 01:23:02,000
understood the concept you wouldn't make
 

5115
01:23:02,000 --> 01:23:03,910
understood the concept you wouldn't make
that mistake

5116
01:23:03,910 --> 01:23:03,920
that mistake
 

5117
01:23:03,920 --> 01:23:07,350
that mistake
and i think that changing that would be

5118
01:23:07,350 --> 01:23:07,360
and i think that changing that would be
 

5119
01:23:07,360 --> 01:23:08,790
and i think that changing that would be
would would that would that would

5120
01:23:08,790 --> 01:23:08,800
would would that would that would
 

5121
01:23:08,800 --> 01:23:10,310
would would that would that would
inspire me that would be yes this is

5122
01:23:10,310 --> 01:23:10,320
inspire me that would be yes this is
 

5123
01:23:10,320 --> 01:23:12,470
inspire me that would be yes this is
this this is this is progress

5124
01:23:12,470 --> 01:23:12,480
this this is this is progress
 

5125
01:23:12,480 --> 01:23:14,629
this this is this is progress
yeah that's that's a really nice way to

5126
01:23:14,629 --> 01:23:14,639
yeah that's that's a really nice way to
 

5127
01:23:14,639 --> 01:23:16,629
yeah that's that's a really nice way to
put it but i also just

5128
01:23:16,629 --> 01:23:16,639
put it but i also just
 

5129
01:23:16,639 --> 01:23:19,590
put it but i also just
don't like that human instinct to

5130
01:23:19,590 --> 01:23:19,600
don't like that human instinct to
 

5131
01:23:19,600 --> 01:23:21,430
don't like that human instinct to
criticize a model is not intelligent

5132
01:23:21,430 --> 01:23:21,440
criticize a model is not intelligent
 

5133
01:23:21,440 --> 01:23:23,189
criticize a model is not intelligent
that's the same instinct as we do when

5134
01:23:23,189 --> 01:23:23,199
that's the same instinct as we do when
 

5135
01:23:23,199 --> 01:23:24,310
that's the same instinct as we do when
we criticize

5136
01:23:24,310 --> 01:23:24,320
we criticize
 

5137
01:23:24,320 --> 01:23:28,709
we criticize
any group of creatures as the other

5138
01:23:28,709 --> 01:23:28,719
any group of creatures as the other
 

5139
01:23:28,719 --> 01:23:32,709
any group of creatures as the other
because it's very possible that

5140
01:23:32,709 --> 01:23:32,719
because it's very possible that
 

5141
01:23:32,719 --> 01:23:35,189
because it's very possible that
gpt2 is much smarter than human beings

5142
01:23:35,189 --> 01:23:35,199
gpt2 is much smarter than human beings
 

5143
01:23:35,199 --> 01:23:36,310
gpt2 is much smarter than human beings
and many things

5144
01:23:36,310 --> 01:23:36,320
and many things
 

5145
01:23:36,320 --> 01:23:38,149
and many things
that's definitely true it has a lot more

5146
01:23:38,149 --> 01:23:38,159
that's definitely true it has a lot more
 

5147
01:23:38,159 --> 01:23:40,149
that's definitely true it has a lot more
breadth of knowledge yes

5148
01:23:40,149 --> 01:23:40,159
breadth of knowledge yes
 

5149
01:23:40,159 --> 01:23:42,629
breadth of knowledge yes
breadth knowledge and even and even

5150
01:23:42,629 --> 01:23:42,639
breadth knowledge and even and even
 

5151
01:23:42,639 --> 01:23:43,270
breadth knowledge and even and even
perhaps

5152
01:23:43,270 --> 01:23:43,280
perhaps
 

5153
01:23:43,280 --> 01:23:46,390
perhaps
depth on certain topics it's kind of

5154
01:23:46,390 --> 01:23:46,400
depth on certain topics it's kind of
 

5155
01:23:46,400 --> 01:23:47,510
depth on certain topics it's kind of
hard to judge what

5156
01:23:47,510 --> 01:23:47,520
hard to judge what
 

5157
01:23:47,520 --> 01:23:49,590
hard to judge what
depth means but there's definitely a

5158
01:23:49,590 --> 01:23:49,600
depth means but there's definitely a
 

5159
01:23:49,600 --> 01:23:51,110
depth means but there's definitely a
sense in which

5160
01:23:51,110 --> 01:23:51,120
sense in which
 

5161
01:23:51,120 --> 01:23:53,350
sense in which
humans don't make mistakes that these

5162
01:23:53,350 --> 01:23:53,360
humans don't make mistakes that these
 

5163
01:23:53,360 --> 01:23:54,390
humans don't make mistakes that these
models do

5164
01:23:54,390 --> 01:23:54,400
models do
 

5165
01:23:54,400 --> 01:23:56,790
models do
yes the same is applied to autonomous

5166
01:23:56,790 --> 01:23:56,800
yes the same is applied to autonomous
 

5167
01:23:56,800 --> 01:23:57,590
yes the same is applied to autonomous
vehicles

5168
01:23:57,590 --> 01:23:57,600
vehicles
 

5169
01:23:57,600 --> 01:23:59,030
vehicles
the same is probably going to continue

5170
01:23:59,030 --> 01:23:59,040
the same is probably going to continue
 

5171
01:23:59,040 --> 01:24:00,390
the same is probably going to continue
being applied to a lot of artificial

5172
01:24:00,390 --> 01:24:00,400
being applied to a lot of artificial
 

5173
01:24:00,400 --> 01:24:01,669
being applied to a lot of artificial
intelligence systems

5174
01:24:01,669 --> 01:24:01,679
intelligence systems
 

5175
01:24:01,679 --> 01:24:04,390
intelligence systems
we find this is the annoying this is the

5176
01:24:04,390 --> 01:24:04,400
we find this is the annoying this is the
 

5177
01:24:04,400 --> 01:24:05,590
we find this is the annoying this is the
process of

5178
01:24:05,590 --> 01:24:05,600
process of
 

5179
01:24:05,600 --> 01:24:07,350
process of
in the 21st century the process of

5180
01:24:07,350 --> 01:24:07,360
in the 21st century the process of
 

5181
01:24:07,360 --> 01:24:09,430
in the 21st century the process of
analyzing the progress of ai

5182
01:24:09,430 --> 01:24:09,440
analyzing the progress of ai
 

5183
01:24:09,440 --> 01:24:12,310
analyzing the progress of ai
is the search for one case where the

5184
01:24:12,310 --> 01:24:12,320
is the search for one case where the
 

5185
01:24:12,320 --> 01:24:13,350
is the search for one case where the
system fails

5186
01:24:13,350 --> 01:24:13,360
system fails
 

5187
01:24:13,360 --> 01:24:16,950
system fails
in a big way where humans would not

5188
01:24:16,950 --> 01:24:16,960
in a big way where humans would not
 

5189
01:24:16,960 --> 01:24:19,590
in a big way where humans would not
and then many people writing articles

5190
01:24:19,590 --> 01:24:19,600
and then many people writing articles
 

5191
01:24:19,600 --> 01:24:20,629
and then many people writing articles
about it

5192
01:24:20,629 --> 01:24:20,639
about it
 

5193
01:24:20,639 --> 01:24:22,950
about it
and then broadly as a com as a the

01:24:22,950 --> 01:24:22,960
and then broadly as a com as a the
 

5195

01:24:24,950 --> 01:24:24,960
public generally gets convinced that the
 

5197
01:24:24,960 --> 01:24:26,470
public generally gets convinced that the
system is not intelligent

5198
01:24:26,470 --> 01:24:26,480
system is not intelligent
 

5199
01:24:26,480 --> 01:24:29,110
system is not intelligent
and we like pacify ourselves by thinking

5200
01:24:29,110 --> 01:24:29,120
and we like pacify ourselves by thinking
 

5201
01:24:29,120 --> 01:24:30,950
and we like pacify ourselves by thinking
it's not intelligent because of this one

5202
01:24:30,950 --> 01:24:30,960
it's not intelligent because of this one
 

5203
01:24:30,960 --> 01:24:33,030
it's not intelligent because of this one
anecdotal case and this can seems to

5204
01:24:33,030 --> 01:24:33,040
anecdotal case and this can seems to
 

5205
01:24:33,040 --> 01:24:34,550
anecdotal case and this can seems to
continue happening

5206
01:24:34,550 --> 01:24:34,560
continue happening
 

5207
01:24:34,560 --> 01:24:36,070
continue happening
yeah i mean there is truth to that

5208
01:24:36,070 --> 01:24:36,080
yeah i mean there is truth to that
 

5209
01:24:36,080 --> 01:24:37,350
yeah i mean there is truth to that
though there is people also i'm sure

5210
01:24:37,350 --> 01:24:37,360

01:27:40,070 --> 01:27:40,080
essentially press the reset button and
 

5377
01:27:40,080 --> 01:27:42,790
essentially press the reset button and
say re-randomize the parameters here

5378
01:27:42,790 --> 01:27:42,800
say re-randomize the parameters here
 

5379
01:27:42,800 --> 01:27:43,669
say re-randomize the parameters here
well let me

5380
01:27:43,669 --> 01:27:43,679
well let me
 

5381
01:27:43,679 --> 01:27:46,709
well let me
sort of that's actually okay that's a

5382
01:27:46,709 --> 01:27:46,719
sort of that's actually okay that's a
 

5383
01:27:46,719 --> 01:27:47,830
sort of that's actually okay that's a
beautiful vision

5384
01:27:47,830 --> 01:27:47,840
beautiful vision
 

5385
01:27:47,840 --> 01:27:50,709
beautiful vision
i think as long as it's possible to con

5386
01:27:50,709 --> 01:27:50,719
i think as long as it's possible to con
 

5387
01:27:50,719 --> 01:27:51,110
i think as long as it's possible to con
to

5388
01:27:51,110 --> 01:27:51,120
to
 

5389
01:27:51,120 --> 01:27:53,990
to
press the reset button do you think it

5390
01:27:53,990 --> 01:27:54,000
press the reset button do you think it
 

5391
01:27:54,000 --> 01:27:55,270
press the reset button do you think it
will always be possible to press the

5392
01:27:55,270 --> 01:27:55,280
will always be possible to press the
 

5393
01:27:55,280 --> 01:27:56,229
will always be possible to press the
reset button

5394
01:27:56,229 --> 01:27:56,239
reset button
 

5395
01:27:56,239 --> 01:27:59,030
reset button
so i think that it's def it's definitely

5396
01:27:59,030 --> 01:27:59,040
so i think that it's def it's definitely
 

5397
01:27:59,040 --> 01:28:01,990
so i think that it's def it's definitely
be possible to build

5398
01:28:01,990 --> 01:28:02,000
be possible to build
 

5399
01:28:02,000 --> 01:28:04,470
be possible to build
so you're talking so the question that i

5400
01:28:04,470 --> 01:28:04,480
so you're talking so the question that i
 

5401
01:28:04,480 --> 01:28:05,750
so you're talking so the question that i
really understand from you

5402
01:28:05,750 --> 01:28:05,760
really understand from you
 

5403
01:28:05,760 --> 01:28:11,189
really understand from you
is will reveal humans or

5404
01:28:11,189 --> 01:28:11,199

 

5405
01:28:11,199 --> 01:28:12,950

humans people have control over the ai

5406
01:28:12,950 --> 01:28:12,960
humans people have control over the ai
 

5407
01:28:12,960 --> 01:28:14,229
humans people have control over the ai
systems that they built

5408
01:28:14,229 --> 01:28:14,239
systems that they built
 

5409
01:28:14,239 --> 01:28:16,709
systems that they built
yes and my answer is it's definitely

5410
01:28:16,709 --> 01:28:16,719
yes and my answer is it's definitely
 

5411
01:28:16,719 --> 01:28:18,870
yes and my answer is it's definitely
possible to build ai systems which

5412
01:28:18,870 --> 01:28:18,880
possible to build ai systems which
 

5413
01:28:18,880 --> 01:28:20,550
possible to build ai systems which
will want to be controlled by their

5414
01:28:20,550 --> 01:28:20,560
will want to be controlled by their
 

5415
01:28:20,560 --> 01:28:23,910
will want to be controlled by their
humans wow that's part of their

5416
01:28:23,910 --> 01:28:23,920
humans wow that's part of their
 

5417
01:28:23,920 --> 01:28:25,350
humans wow that's part of their
so it's not that just they can't help

5418
01:28:25,350 --> 01:28:25,360
so it's not that just they can't help
 

5419
01:28:25,360 --> 01:28:29,270
so it's not that just they can't help
but be controlled but that's that's um

5420
01:28:29,270 --> 01:28:29,280
but be controlled but that's that's um
 

5421
01:28:29,280 --> 01:28:32,550
but be controlled but that's that's um
the they exist the one of the objectives

5422
01:28:32,550 --> 01:28:32,560
the they exist the one of the objectives
 

5423
01:28:32,560 --> 01:28:34,470
the they exist the one of the objectives
of their existence is to be controlled

5424
01:28:34,470 --> 01:28:34,480
of their existence is to be controlled
 

5425
01:28:34,480 --> 01:28:39,750
of their existence is to be controlled
in the same way that human parents

5426
01:28:39,750 --> 01:28:39,760

 

5427
01:28:39,760 --> 01:28:42,310

generally want to help their children

they want their children to succeed
 

5431
01:28:44,320 --> 01:28:46,229
they want their children to succeed
it's not a burden for them they are

5432
01:28:46,229 --> 01:28:46,239
it's not a burden for them they are
 

5433
01:28:46,239 --> 01:28:47,830
it's not a burden for them they are
excited to

with highest conviction that the same
will be possible

5444
01:28:57,990 --> 01:28:58,000
will be possible
 

5445
01:28:58,000 --> 01:28:59,510
will be possible
for an agi it will be possible to

5446
01:28:59,510 --> 01:28:59,520
for an agi it will be possible to
 

5447
01:28:59,520 --> 01:29:01,430
for an agi it will be possible to
program an agi to design it in such a

5448
01:29:01,430 --> 01:29:01,440
program an agi to design it in such a
 

5449
01:29:01,440 --> 01:29:03,270
program an agi to design it in such a
way that it will have a similar

5450
01:29:03,270 --> 01:29:03,280
way that it will have a similar
 

5451
01:29:03,280 --> 01:29:05,990
way that it will have a similar
deep drive that it will be delighted to

5452
01:29:05,990 --> 01:29:06,000
deep drive that it will be delighted to
 

5453
01:29:06,000 --> 01:29:06,870
deep drive that it will be delighted to
fulfill

5454

fulfill
 

5455
01:29:06,880 --> 01:29:09,110
fulfill
and the drive will be to help humans

5456

flourish
but let me take a step back to that

5460
01:29:13,189 --> 01:29:13,199
but let me take a step back to that
 

5461
01:29:13,199 --> 01:29:15,430
but let me take a step back to that
moment where you create the agi system i

5462
01:29:15,430 --> 01:29:15,440
moment where you create the agi system i
 

5463
01:29:15,440 --> 01:29:18,870
moment where you create the agi system i
think this is a really crucial moment

5464

think this is a really crucial moment
 

5465
01:29:18,880 --> 01:29:22,870
think this is a really crucial moment
and between that moment and

5466
01:29:22,870 --> 01:29:22,880
and between that moment and
 

5467
01:29:22,880 --> 01:29:26,149
and between that moment and
the the democratic board members with

5468
01:29:26,149 --> 01:29:26,159
the the democratic board members with
 

5469

the the democratic board members with
the agi at the head

5470

the agi at the head
 

5471
01:29:28,800 --> 01:29:31,669

01:30:36,470 --> 01:30:36,480
people good is another way to ask it
 

5537
01:30:36,480 --> 01:30:39,350
people good is another way to ask it
so i don't know if most people are good

5538
01:30:39,350 --> 01:30:39,360
so i don't know if most people are good
 

5539
01:30:39,360 --> 01:30:42,149
so i don't know if most people are good
but

5540
01:30:42,149 --> 01:30:42,159

 

5541
01:30:42,159 --> 01:30:44,310

i think that when it really counts

5542
01:30:44,310 --> 01:30:44,320
i think that when it really counts
 

5543
01:30:44,320 --> 01:30:46,870
i think that when it really counts
people can be better than we think

5544
01:30:46,870 --> 01:30:46,880
people can be better than we think
 

5545
01:30:46,880 --> 01:30:49,590
people can be better than we think
that's beautifully put yeah are there

5546
01:30:49,590 --> 01:30:49,600
that's beautifully put yeah are there
 

5547
01:30:49,600 --> 01:30:51,430
that's beautifully put yeah are there
specific mechanisms you can think of

5548
01:30:51,430 --> 01:30:51,440
specific mechanisms you can think of
 

5549
01:30:51,440 --> 01:30:53,590
specific mechanisms you can think of
of aligning aig and values to human

5550
01:30:53,590 --> 01:30:53,600
of aligning aig and values to human
 

5551
01:30:53,600 --> 01:30:54,470
of aligning aig and values to human
values

5552
01:30:54,470 --> 01:30:54,480
values
 

5553
01:30:54,480 --> 01:30:56,149
values
is that do you think about these

5554
01:30:56,149 --> 01:30:56,159
is that do you think about these
 

5555
01:30:56,159 --> 01:30:58,310
is that do you think about these
problems of continued alignment

5556
01:30:58,310 --> 01:30:58,320
problems of continued alignment
 

5557
01:30:58,320 --> 01:31:00,830
problems of continued alignment
as we develop the eye systems yeah

5558
01:31:00,830 --> 01:31:00,840
as we develop the eye systems yeah
 

5559
01:31:00,840 --> 01:31:02,709
as we develop the eye systems yeah
definitely

5560
01:31:02,709 --> 01:31:02,719
definitely
 

5561
01:31:02,719 --> 01:31:05,910
definitely
in some sense the kind of question which

5562
01:31:05,910 --> 01:31:05,920
in some sense the kind of question which
 

5563
01:31:05,920 --> 01:31:06,790
in some sense the kind of question which
you are asking

5564
01:31:06,790 --> 01:31:06,800
you are asking
 

5565
01:31:06,800 --> 01:31:08,790
you are asking
is so if you have to translate that

5566
01:31:08,790 --> 01:31:08,800
is so if you have to translate that
 

5567
01:31:08,800 --> 01:31:10,229
is so if you have to translate that
question to today's terms

5568
01:31:10,229 --> 01:31:10,239
question to today's terms
 

5569
01:31:10,239 --> 01:31:13,350
question to today's terms
yes it would be a question about

5570
01:31:13,350 --> 01:31:13,360
yes it would be a question about
 

5571
01:31:13,360 --> 01:31:16,870
yes it would be a question about
how to get an rl agent

5572
01:31:16,870 --> 01:31:16,880
how to get an rl agent
 

5573
01:31:16,880 --> 01:31:19,350
how to get an rl agent
that's optimizing a value function which

5574
01:31:19,350 --> 01:31:19,360
that's optimizing a value function which
 

5575
01:31:19,360 --> 01:31:21,030
that's optimizing a value function which
itself is learned

5576
01:31:21,030 --> 01:31:21,040
itself is learned
 

5577
01:31:21,040 --> 01:31:22,629
itself is learned
and if you look at humans humans are

5578
01:31:22,629 --> 01:31:22,639
and if you look at humans humans are
 

5579
01:31:22,639 --> 01:31:24,070
and if you look at humans humans are
like that because the

5580
01:31:24,070 --> 01:31:24,080
like that because the
 

5581
01:31:24,080 --> 01:31:25,750
like that because the
reward function the value function of

5582
01:31:25,750 --> 01:31:25,760
reward function the value function of
 

5583
01:31:25,760 --> 01:31:27,430
reward function the value function of
humans is not external

5584
01:31:27,430 --> 01:31:27,440
humans is not external
 

5585
01:31:27,440 --> 01:31:32,310
humans is not external
it is internal that's right and

5586
01:31:32,310 --> 01:31:32,320
it is internal that's right and
 

5587
01:31:32,320 --> 01:31:35,350
it is internal that's right and
there are definite ideas of how to train

5588
01:31:35,350 --> 01:31:35,360
there are definite ideas of how to train
 

5589
01:31:35,360 --> 01:31:38,229
there are definite ideas of how to train
a value function basically an objective

5590
01:31:38,229 --> 01:31:38,239
a value function basically an objective
 

5591
01:31:38,239 --> 01:31:38,950
a value function basically an objective
you know

5592
01:31:38,950 --> 01:31:38,960
you know
 

5593
01:31:38,960 --> 01:31:40,950
you know
and as objective as possible perception

5594
01:31:40,950 --> 01:31:40,960
and as objective as possible perception
 

5595
01:31:40,960 --> 01:31:42,390
and as objective as possible perception
system

5596

system
 

5597
01:31:42,400 --> 01:31:45,750
system
that will be trained separately

5598
01:31:45,750 --> 01:31:45,760
that will be trained separately
 

5599
01:31:45,760 --> 01:31:49,030
that will be trained separately
to recognize to internalize human

5600
01:31:49,030 --> 01:31:49,040
to recognize to internalize human
 

5601
01:31:49,040 --> 01:31:49,750
to recognize to internalize human
judgments

5602
01:31:49,750 --> 01:31:49,760
judgments
 

5603
01:31:49,760 --> 01:31:52,709
judgments
on different situations and then that

5604
01:31:52,709 --> 01:31:52,719
on different situations and then that
 

5605
01:31:52,719 --> 01:31:54,470
on different situations and then that
component would then be integrated

5606
01:31:54,470 --> 01:31:54,480
component would then be integrated
 

5607
01:31:54,480 --> 01:31:56,470
component would then be integrated
as the value as the base value function

5608
01:31:56,470 --> 01:31:56,480
as the value as the base value function
 

5609
01:31:56,480 --> 01:31:57,990
as the value as the base value function
for some more capable

5610
01:31:57,990 --> 01:31:58,000
for some more capable
 

5611
01:31:58,000 --> 01:31:59,910
for some more capable
rail system you could imagine a process

5612
01:31:59,910 --> 01:31:59,920
rail system you could imagine a process
 

5613
01:31:59,920 --> 01:32:01,750
rail system you could imagine a process
like this i'm not saying this is

5614
01:32:01,750 --> 01:32:01,760
like this i'm not saying this is
 

5615
01:32:01,760 --> 01:32:03,110
like this i'm not saying this is
the process i'm saying this is an

5616
01:32:03,110 --> 01:32:03,120
the process i'm saying this is an
 

5617
01:32:03,120 --> 01:32:05,189
the process i'm saying this is an
example of the kind of thing you could

5618
01:32:05,189 --> 01:32:05,199
example of the kind of thing you could
 

5619
01:32:05,199 --> 01:32:07,430
example of the kind of thing you could
do

5620
01:32:07,430 --> 01:32:07,440

 

5621
01:32:07,440 --> 01:32:10,629

so on that topic of the objective

5622
01:32:10,629 --> 01:32:10,639
so on that topic of the objective
 

5623
01:32:10,639 --> 01:32:12,310
so on that topic of the objective
functions of human existence

5624
01:32:12,310 --> 01:32:12,320
functions of human existence
 

5625
01:32:12,320 --> 01:32:13,590
functions of human existence
what do you think is the objective

5626
01:32:13,590 --> 01:32:13,600
what do you think is the objective
 

5627
01:32:13,600 --> 01:32:15,510
what do you think is the objective
function that

5628
01:32:15,510 --> 01:32:15,520
function that
 

5629
01:32:15,520 --> 01:32:17,590
function that
is implicit in human existence what's

5630
01:32:17,590 --> 01:32:17,600
is implicit in human existence what's
 

5631
01:32:17,600 --> 01:32:24,830
is implicit in human existence what's
the meaning of life

5632
01:32:24,830 --> 01:32:24,840

 

5633
01:32:24,840 --> 01:32:28,709

oh

5634
01:32:28,709 --> 01:32:28,719

 

5635
01:32:28,719 --> 01:32:31,189

i think the question is is wrong in some

5636
01:32:31,189 --> 01:32:31,199
i think the question is is wrong in some
 

5637
01:32:31,199 --> 01:32:32,470
i think the question is is wrong in some
way i think that

5638
01:32:32,470 --> 01:32:32,480
way i think that
 

5639
01:32:32,480 --> 01:32:34,390
way i think that
the question implies that the reason

5640
01:32:34,390 --> 01:32:34,400
the question implies that the reason
 

5641
01:32:34,400 --> 01:32:35,830
the question implies that the reason
there is an objective answer which is an

5642
01:32:35,830 --> 01:32:35,840
there is an objective answer which is an
 

5643
01:32:35,840 --> 01:32:37,110
there is an objective answer which is an
external answer you know your meaning of

5644
01:32:37,110 --> 01:32:37,120
external answer you know your meaning of
 

5645
01:32:37,120 --> 01:32:38,070
external answer you know your meaning of
life is x

5646
01:32:38,070 --> 01:32:38,080
life is x
 

5647
01:32:38,080 --> 01:32:40,149
life is x
right i think what's going on is that we

5648
01:32:40,149 --> 01:32:40,159
right i think what's going on is that we
 

5649
01:32:40,159 --> 01:32:42,390
right i think what's going on is that we
exist and

5650
01:32:42,390 --> 01:32:42,400
exist and
 

5651
01:32:42,400 --> 01:32:44,950
exist and
that's amazing and we should try to make

5652
01:32:44,950 --> 01:32:44,960
that's amazing and we should try to make
 

5653
01:32:44,960 --> 01:32:46,310
that's amazing and we should try to make
the most of it and try to

5654
01:32:46,310 --> 01:32:46,320
the most of it and try to
 

5655
01:32:46,320 --> 01:32:49,750
the most of it and try to
maximize our own value and enjoyment of

5656
01:32:49,750 --> 01:32:49,760
maximize our own value and enjoyment of
 

5657
01:32:49,760 --> 01:32:53,189
maximize our own value and enjoyment of
a very short time while we do exist

5658
01:32:53,189 --> 01:32:53,199
a very short time while we do exist
 

5659
01:32:53,199 --> 01:32:55,189
a very short time while we do exist
it's funny because action does require

5660
01:32:55,189 --> 01:32:55,199
it's funny because action does require
 

5661
01:32:55,199 --> 01:32:56,870
it's funny because action does require
an objective function it's definitely

5662
01:32:56,870 --> 01:32:56,880
an objective function it's definitely
 

5663
01:32:56,880 --> 01:32:59,350
an objective function it's definitely
theirs in some form but it's difficult

5664
01:32:59,350 --> 01:32:59,360
theirs in some form but it's difficult
 

5665
01:32:59,360 --> 01:33:00,950
theirs in some form but it's difficult
to make it explicit

5666
01:33:00,950 --> 01:33:00,960
to make it explicit
 

5667
01:33:00,960 --> 01:33:02,709
to make it explicit
and maybe impossible to make it explicit

5668
01:33:02,709 --> 01:33:02,719
and maybe impossible to make it explicit
 

5669
01:33:02,719 --> 01:33:03,910
and maybe impossible to make it explicit
i guess is what you're getting at and

5670
01:33:03,910 --> 01:33:03,920
i guess is what you're getting at and
 

5671
01:33:03,920 --> 01:33:06,149
i guess is what you're getting at and
that's an interesting

5672
01:33:06,149 --> 01:33:06,159
that's an interesting
 

5673
01:33:06,159 --> 01:33:09,110
that's an interesting
fact of an rl environment well but i was

5674
01:33:09,110 --> 01:33:09,120
fact of an rl environment well but i was
 

5675
01:33:09,120 --> 01:33:10,629
fact of an rl environment well but i was
making a slightly different point is

5676
01:33:10,629 --> 01:33:10,639
making a slightly different point is
 

5677
01:33:10,639 --> 01:33:11,750
making a slightly different point is
that

5678
01:33:11,750 --> 01:33:11,760
that
 

5679
01:33:11,760 --> 01:33:15,030
that
humans want things and their ones create

5680
01:33:15,030 --> 01:33:15,040
humans want things and their ones create
 

5681
01:33:15,040 --> 01:33:17,510
humans want things and their ones create
the drives that cause them to you know

5682
01:33:17,510 --> 01:33:17,520
the drives that cause them to you know
 

5683
01:33:17,520 --> 01:33:19,750
the drives that cause them to you know
our wants are our objective functions

5684
01:33:19,750 --> 01:33:19,760
our wants are our objective functions
 

5685
01:33:19,760 --> 01:33:21,990
our wants are our objective functions
our individual objective functions we

5686
01:33:21,990 --> 01:33:22,000
our individual objective functions we
 

5687
01:33:22,000 --> 01:33:24,149
our individual objective functions we
can later decide that we want to change

5688
01:33:24,149 --> 01:33:24,159
can later decide that we want to change
 

5689
01:33:24,159 --> 01:33:25,750
can later decide that we want to change
that what we wanted before is no longer

5690
01:33:25,750 --> 01:33:25,760
that what we wanted before is no longer
 

5691
01:33:25,760 --> 01:33:27,510
that what we wanted before is no longer
good and we want something else yeah but

5692
01:33:27,510 --> 01:33:27,520
good and we want something else yeah but
 

5693
01:33:27,520 --> 01:33:28,950
good and we want something else yeah but
they're so dynamic there's

01:33:28,960 --> 01:33:31,110
they're so dynamic there's
there's got to be some underlying sort

fear of death and there's also the
 

5707
01:33:39,040 --> 01:33:40,709

evolutionary arguments

5714
01:33:45,990 --> 01:33:46,000
evolutionary arguments
 

5715
01:33:46,000 --> 01:33:47,910
evolutionary arguments
it seems to be there might be some kind

5716
01:33:47,910 --> 01:33:47,920
it seems to be there might be some kind
 

5717
01:33:47,920 --> 01:33:50,310
it seems to be there might be some kind
of fundamental objective function from

5718
01:33:50,310 --> 01:33:50,320
of fundamental objective function from
 

5719
01:33:50,320 --> 01:33:53,990
of fundamental objective function from
from which everything else uh emerges

5720
01:33:53,990 --> 01:33:54,000
from which everything else uh emerges
 

5721
01:33:54,000 --> 01:33:55,510
from which everything else uh emerges
but it seems because that's very

5722
01:33:55,510 --> 01:33:55,520
but it seems because that's very
 

5723
01:33:55,520 --> 01:33:57,510
but it seems because that's very
important i think i think that probably

5724
01:33:57,510 --> 01:33:57,520
important i think i think that probably
 

5725
01:33:57,520 --> 01:33:58,790
important i think i think that probably
is an evolutionary objective function

5726
01:33:58,790 --> 01:33:58,800
is an evolutionary objective function
 

5727
01:33:58,800 --> 01:34:00,310
is an evolutionary objective function
which is to survive and procreate and

5728
01:34:00,310 --> 01:34:00,320
which is to survive and procreate and
 

5729
01:34:00,320 --> 01:34:02,470
which is to survive and procreate and

5731
01:34:02,480 --> 01:34:05,590
make sure you make your children succeed
that would be my guess but it doesn't

5732
01:34:05,590 --> 01:34:05,600
that would be my guess but it doesn't
 

5733
01:34:05,600 --> 01:34:06,950
that would be my guess but it doesn't
give an answer to the question what's

5734
01:34:06,950 --> 01:34:06,960
give an answer to the question what's
 

5735
01:34:06,960 --> 01:34:08,070
give an answer to the question what's
the meaning of life

process we are
 

5743
01:34:15,440 --> 01:34:18,950
process we are
we are we exist on a small planet

5744
01:34:18,950 --> 01:34:18,960
we are we exist on a small planet
 

5745
01:34:18,960 --> 01:34:23,189
we are we exist on a small planet
and that's it so given that we exist try

all the breakthroughs i mentioned in

01:35:21,750 --> 01:35:21,760
all the breakthroughs i mentioned in
 

5811
01:35:21,760 --> 01:35:24,550
all the breakthroughs i mentioned in
computer vision and language and so on

5812
01:35:24,550 --> 01:35:24,560
computer vision and language and so on
 

5813
01:35:24,560 --> 01:35:28,229
computer vision and language and so on
is what is the source of happiness

5814
01:35:28,229 --> 01:35:28,239
is what is the source of happiness
 

5815
01:35:28,239 --> 01:35:29,910
is what is the source of happiness
and pride for you i mean all those

5816
01:35:29,910 --> 01:35:29,920
and pride for you i mean all those
 

5817
01:35:29,920 --> 01:35:31,350
and pride for you i mean all those
things are a source of pride for sure

5818
01:35:31,350 --> 01:35:31,360
things are a source of pride for sure
 

5819
01:35:31,360 --> 01:35:32,390
things are a source of pride for sure
i'm very

5820
01:35:32,390 --> 01:35:32,400
i'm very
 

5821
01:35:32,400 --> 01:35:34,149
i'm very
ungrateful for having done all those

5822
01:35:34,149 --> 01:35:34,159
ungrateful for having done all those
 

5823
01:35:34,159 --> 01:35:37,270
ungrateful for having done all those
things and it was very fun to do them

5824
01:35:37,270 --> 01:35:37,280
things and it was very fun to do them
 

5825
01:35:37,280 --> 01:35:38,709
things and it was very fun to do them
but happiness comes from but you know

5826
01:35:38,709 --> 01:35:38,719
but happiness comes from but you know
 

5827
01:35:38,719 --> 01:35:40,870
but happiness comes from but you know
you can happiness well

5828
01:35:40,870 --> 01:35:40,880
you can happiness well
 

5829
01:35:40,880 --> 01:35:42,550
you can happiness well
my current view is that happiness comes

5830
01:35:42,550 --> 01:35:42,560
my current view is that happiness comes
 

5831
01:35:42,560 --> 01:35:43,990
my current view is that happiness comes
from our

5832
01:35:43,990 --> 01:35:44,000
from our
 

5833
01:35:44,000 --> 01:35:45,750
from our
to allow to a very large degree from the

5834
01:35:45,750 --> 01:35:45,760
to allow to a very large degree from the
 

5835
01:35:45,760 --> 01:35:47,590
to allow to a very large degree from the
way we look at things

5836
01:35:47,590 --> 01:35:47,600
way we look at things
 

5837
01:35:47,600 --> 01:35:49,830
way we look at things
you know you can have a simple meal and

5838
01:35:49,830 --> 01:35:49,840
you know you can have a simple meal and
 

5839
01:35:49,840 --> 01:35:51,510
you know you can have a simple meal and
be quite happy as a result or you can

5840
01:35:51,510 --> 01:35:51,520
be quite happy as a result or you can
 

5841
01:35:51,520 --> 01:35:52,870
be quite happy as a result or you can
talk to someone and

5842
01:35:52,870 --> 01:35:52,880
talk to someone and
 

5843
01:35:52,880 --> 01:35:55,750
talk to someone and
be happy as a result as well or

5844
01:35:55,750 --> 01:35:55,760
be happy as a result as well or
 

5845
01:35:55,760 --> 01:35:57,350
be happy as a result as well or
conversely you can have a meal and be

5846
01:35:57,350 --> 01:35:57,360
conversely you can have a meal and be
 

5847
01:35:57,360 --> 01:35:58,870
conversely you can have a meal and be
disappointed that the meal wasn't a

5848
01:35:58,870 --> 01:35:58,880
disappointed that the meal wasn't a
 

5849
01:35:58,880 --> 01:36:00,310
disappointed that the meal wasn't a
better meal

5850
01:36:00,310 --> 01:36:00,320
better meal
 

5851
01:36:00,320 --> 01:36:02,070
better meal
so i think a lot of happiness comes from

5852
01:36:02,070 --> 01:36:02,080
so i think a lot of happiness comes from
 

5853
01:36:02,080 --> 01:36:03,270
so i think a lot of happiness comes from
that but i'm not sure i don't want to be

5854
01:36:03,270 --> 01:36:03,280
that but i'm not sure i don't want to be
 

5855
01:36:03,280 --> 01:36:05,510
that but i'm not sure i don't want to be
too confident i

5856
01:36:05,510 --> 01:36:05,520
too confident i
 

5857
01:36:05,520 --> 01:36:06,870
too confident i
being humble in the face of the

5858
01:36:06,870 --> 01:36:06,880
