to wander about the world maybe to
 

291
00:05:22,320 --> 00:05:23,930
to wander about the world maybe to
construct narratives about the world and

292
00:05:23,930 --> 00:05:23,940
construct narratives about the world and

effects to play with they still probably
felt the narratives the myths they

300
00:05:34,490 --> 00:05:34,500
felt the narratives the myths they
 

301
00:05:34,500 --> 00:05:36,650
felt the narratives the myths they
constructed as intensely as we do oh

00:05:54,600 --> 00:05:56,450
relative so how about how many people in
history have experienced a hot shower

320
00:05:56,450 --> 00:05:56,460
history have experienced a hot shower
 

321
00:05:56,460 --> 00:05:59,390
history have experienced a hot shower
like almost none that's like when we're

322
00:05:59,390 --> 00:05:59,400
like almost none that's like when we're
 

323
00:05:59,400 --> 00:06:01,490
like almost none that's like when we're
hot showers invented 100 years ago

324
00:06:01,490 --> 00:06:01,500
hot showers invented 100 years ago
 

325
00:06:01,500 --> 00:06:03,170
hot showers invented 100 years ago
like less

326
00:06:03,170 --> 00:06:03,180
like less
 

327
00:06:03,180 --> 00:06:05,870
like less
um so like like George Washington never

328
00:06:05,870 --> 00:06:05,880
um so like like George Washington never
 

329
00:06:05,880 --> 00:06:08,210
um so like like George Washington never
had a hot shower it's like it's just

330
00:06:08,210 --> 00:06:08,220
had a hot shower it's like it's just
 

331
00:06:08,220 --> 00:06:09,950
had a hot shower it's like it's just
kind of weird like he he took cold

332
00:06:09,950 --> 00:06:09,960
kind of weird like he he took cold
 

333
00:06:09,960 --> 00:06:12,230
kind of weird like he he took cold
showers all the time or like

334
00:06:12,230 --> 00:06:12,240
showers all the time or like
 

335
00:06:12,240 --> 00:06:13,969
showers all the time or like
um and again we just take this for

336
00:06:13,969 --> 00:06:13,979
um and again we just take this for
 

337
00:06:13,979 --> 00:06:15,890
um and again we just take this for
granted but that's like an unbelievable

338
00:06:15,890 --> 00:06:15,900
granted but that's like an unbelievable
 

339
00:06:15,900 --> 00:06:19,490
granted but that's like an unbelievable
life experience to have a rain a

340
00:06:19,490 --> 00:06:19,500
life experience to have a rain a
 

341
00:06:19,500 --> 00:06:21,529
life experience to have a rain a
controlled little booth where it rains

342
00:06:21,529 --> 00:06:21,539
controlled little booth where it rains
 

343
00:06:21,539 --> 00:06:23,870
controlled little booth where it rains
hot water on your head and then you get

344
00:06:23,870 --> 00:06:23,880
hot water on your head and then you get
 

345
00:06:23,880 --> 00:06:25,189
hot water on your head and then you get
out and it's not everywhere it's like

346
00:06:25,189 --> 00:06:25,199
out and it's not everywhere it's like
 

347
00:06:25,199 --> 00:06:26,570
out and it's not everywhere it's like
contained

348
00:06:26,570 --> 00:06:26,580
contained
 

349
00:06:26,580 --> 00:06:28,850
contained
um that was like you know they a lot of

350
00:06:28,850 --> 00:06:28,860
um that was like you know they a lot of
 

351
00:06:28,860 --> 00:06:29,990
um that was like you know they a lot of
people probably lived and died with

352
00:06:29,990 --> 00:06:30,000
people probably lived and died with
 

353
00:06:30,000 --> 00:06:31,850
people probably lived and died with
never experiencing hot water maybe they

354
00:06:31,850 --> 00:06:31,860
never experiencing hot water maybe they
 

355
00:06:31,860 --> 00:06:34,010
never experiencing hot water maybe they
had a way to heat water over a fire but

356
00:06:34,010 --> 00:06:34,020
had a way to heat water over a fire but
 

357
00:06:34,020 --> 00:06:35,390
had a way to heat water over a fire but
like then it's I don't know it's just

358
00:06:35,390 --> 00:06:35,400
like then it's I don't know it's just
 

359
00:06:35,400 --> 00:06:37,070
like then it's I don't know it's just
like there's a there's so many things

360
00:06:37,070 --> 00:06:37,080
like there's a there's so many things
 

361
00:06:37,080 --> 00:06:40,730
like there's a there's so many things
about our lives now that are completely

362
00:06:40,730 --> 00:06:40,740
about our lives now that are completely
 

363
00:06:40,740 --> 00:06:43,070
about our lives now that are completely
just total anomaly it makes me wonder

364
00:06:43,070 --> 00:06:43,080
just total anomaly it makes me wonder
 

365
00:06:43,080 --> 00:06:44,510
just total anomaly it makes me wonder
like what is the thing they've noticed

366
00:06:44,510 --> 00:06:44,520
like what is the thing they've noticed
 

367
00:06:44,520 --> 00:06:46,850
like what is the thing they've noticed
the most I mean the sewage system like

368
00:06:46,850 --> 00:06:46,860
the most I mean the sewage system like
 

369
00:06:46,860 --> 00:06:50,290
the most I mean the sewage system like
it doesn't smell in cities so

370
00:06:50,290 --> 00:06:50,300
it doesn't smell in cities so
 

371
00:06:50,300 --> 00:06:52,850
it doesn't smell in cities so
what does the sewer system do I mean it

372
00:06:52,850 --> 00:06:52,860
what does the sewer system do I mean it
 

373
00:06:52,860 --> 00:06:54,830
what does the sewer system do I mean it
gets rid of waste efficiently Etc we

374
00:06:54,830 --> 00:06:54,840
gets rid of waste efficiently Etc we
 

375
00:06:54,840 --> 00:06:56,629
gets rid of waste efficiently Etc we
don't have to confront it both with our

376
00:06:56,629 --> 00:06:56,639
don't have to confront it both with our
 

377
00:06:56,639 --> 00:06:58,550
don't have to confront it both with our
with any of our senses and that's

378
00:06:58,550 --> 00:06:58,560
with any of our senses and that's
 

379
00:06:58,560 --> 00:07:00,710
with any of our senses and that's
probably wasn't there I mean what else

380
00:07:00,710 --> 00:07:00,720
probably wasn't there I mean what else
 

381
00:07:00,720 --> 00:07:02,510
probably wasn't there I mean what else
plus all the medical stuff associated

382
00:07:02,510 --> 00:07:02,520
plus all the medical stuff associated
 

383
00:07:02,520 --> 00:07:03,770
plus all the medical stuff associated
with yeah I mean how about the disease

384
00:07:03,770 --> 00:07:03,780
with yeah I mean how about the disease
 

385
00:07:03,780 --> 00:07:05,990
with yeah I mean how about the disease
yeah how about the the Cockroaches and

386
00:07:05,990 --> 00:07:06,000
yeah how about the the Cockroaches and
 

387
00:07:06,000 --> 00:07:08,090
yeah how about the the Cockroaches and
the rats and the and the disease and the

388
00:07:08,090 --> 00:07:08,100
the rats and the and the disease and the
 

389
00:07:08,100 --> 00:07:10,550
the rats and the and the disease and the
the plagues and you know and and then

390
00:07:10,550 --> 00:07:10,560
the plagues and you know and and then
 

391
00:07:10,560 --> 00:07:11,870
the plagues and you know and and then
when they got so they they caught more

392
00:07:11,870 --> 00:07:11,880
when they got so they they caught more
 

393
00:07:11,880 --> 00:07:13,189
when they got so they they caught more
diseases but then when they caught the

394
00:07:13,189 --> 00:07:13,199
diseases but then when they caught the
 

395
00:07:13,199 --> 00:07:15,409
diseases but then when they caught the
disease they also didn't have treatment

396
00:07:15,409 --> 00:07:15,419
disease they also didn't have treatment
 

397
00:07:15,419 --> 00:07:17,749
disease they also didn't have treatment
for it so they often would die or they

398
00:07:17,749 --> 00:07:17,759
for it so they often would die or they
 

399
00:07:17,759 --> 00:07:20,150
for it so they often would die or they
would just be in a huge amount of pain

400
00:07:20,150 --> 00:07:20,160
would just be in a huge amount of pain
 

401
00:07:20,160 --> 00:07:22,430
would just be in a huge amount of pain
they also didn't know what the disease

402
00:07:22,430 --> 00:07:22,440
they also didn't know what the disease
 

403
00:07:22,440 --> 00:07:24,170
they also didn't know what the disease
was they didn't know about microbes that

404
00:07:24,170 --> 00:07:24,180
was they didn't know about microbes that
 

405
00:07:24,180 --> 00:07:25,670
was they didn't know about microbes that
was this new thing the idea that these

406
00:07:25,670 --> 00:07:25,680
was this new thing the idea that these
 

407
00:07:25,680 --> 00:07:27,290
was this new thing the idea that these
tiny little animals that are causing

408
00:07:27,290 --> 00:07:27,300
tiny little animals that are causing
 

409
00:07:27,300 --> 00:07:28,730
tiny little animals that are causing
these diseases so what did they think

410
00:07:28,730 --> 00:07:28,740
these diseases so what did they think
 

411
00:07:28,740 --> 00:07:31,249
these diseases so what did they think
you know in the the Bubonic plague you

412
00:07:31,249 --> 00:07:31,259
you know in the the Bubonic plague you
 

413
00:07:31,259 --> 00:07:32,749
you know in the the Bubonic plague you
know and the black death

414
00:07:32,749 --> 00:07:32,759
know and the black death
 

415
00:07:32,759 --> 00:07:35,330
know and the black death
um the 1300s people thought that it was

416
00:07:35,330 --> 00:07:35,340
um the 1300s people thought that it was
 

417
00:07:35,340 --> 00:07:37,550
um the 1300s people thought that it was
an act of God because you know God's

418
00:07:37,550 --> 00:07:37,560
an act of God because you know God's
 

419
00:07:37,560 --> 00:07:39,290
an act of God because you know God's
angry at us because why would you know

420
00:07:39,290 --> 00:07:39,300
angry at us because why would you know
 

421
00:07:39,300 --> 00:07:40,670
angry at us because why would you know
why would you not think that if you

422
00:07:40,670 --> 00:07:40,680
why would you not think that if you
 

423
00:07:40,680 --> 00:07:42,050
why would you not think that if you
didn't know what it was

424
00:07:42,050 --> 00:07:42,060
didn't know what it was
 

425
00:07:42,060 --> 00:07:44,150
didn't know what it was
um and so the crazy thing is that these

426
00:07:44,150 --> 00:07:44,160
um and so the crazy thing is that these
 

427
00:07:44,160 --> 00:07:45,890
um and so the crazy thing is that these
were the same primates so I do know

428
00:07:45,890 --> 00:07:45,900
were the same primates so I do know
 

429
00:07:45,900 --> 00:07:48,290
were the same primates so I do know
something about them I know in some

430
00:07:48,290 --> 00:07:48,300
something about them I know in some
 

431
00:07:48,300 --> 00:07:50,150
something about them I know in some
sense what it's like to be them because

432
00:07:50,150 --> 00:07:50,160
sense what it's like to be them because
 

433
00:07:50,160 --> 00:07:52,490
sense what it's like to be them because
I'm a human as well and to know that

434
00:07:52,490 --> 00:07:52,500
I'm a human as well and to know that
 

435
00:07:52,500 --> 00:07:54,830
I'm a human as well and to know that
this particular primate that I know what

436
00:07:54,830 --> 00:07:54,840
this particular primate that I know what
 

437
00:07:54,840 --> 00:07:57,529
this particular primate that I know what
it's like to be experienced such

438
00:07:57,529 --> 00:07:57,539
it's like to be experienced such
 

439
00:07:57,539 --> 00:07:59,629
it's like to be experienced such
different things it's and and like this

440
00:07:59,629 --> 00:07:59,639
different things it's and and like this
 

441
00:07:59,639 --> 00:08:02,210
different things it's and and like this
isn't our life is not the life that this

442
00:08:02,210 --> 00:08:02,220
isn't our life is not the life that this
 

443
00:08:02,220 --> 00:08:04,309
isn't our life is not the life that this
primate has experienced almost ever so

444
00:08:04,309 --> 00:08:04,319
primate has experienced almost ever so
 

445
00:08:04,319 --> 00:08:07,370
primate has experienced almost ever so
it's just uh it's a bit strange I don't

446
00:08:07,370 --> 00:08:07,380
it's just uh it's a bit strange I don't
 

447
00:08:07,380 --> 00:08:09,529
it's just uh it's a bit strange I don't
know I I have a sense that we would get

448
00:08:09,529 --> 00:08:09,539
know I I have a sense that we would get
 

449
00:08:09,539 --> 00:08:12,770
know I I have a sense that we would get
acclimated very quickly like if we threw

450
00:08:12,770 --> 00:08:12,780
acclimated very quickly like if we threw
 

451
00:08:12,780 --> 00:08:15,050
acclimated very quickly like if we threw
ourselves back a few thousand years ago

452
00:08:15,050 --> 00:08:15,060
ourselves back a few thousand years ago
 

453
00:08:15,060 --> 00:08:17,089
ourselves back a few thousand years ago
it would be very uncomfortable at first

454
00:08:17,089 --> 00:08:17,099
it would be very uncomfortable at first
 

455
00:08:17,099 --> 00:08:18,710
it would be very uncomfortable at first
but the whole hot shower thing you'll

456
00:08:18,710 --> 00:08:18,720
but the whole hot shower thing you'll
 

457
00:08:18,720 --> 00:08:21,110
but the whole hot shower thing you'll
get used to it after a year you would

458
00:08:21,110 --> 00:08:21,120
get used to it after a year you would
 

459
00:08:21,120 --> 00:08:23,990
get used to it after a year you would
not even like miss it because uh was

460
00:08:23,990 --> 00:08:24,000
not even like miss it because uh was
 

461
00:08:24,000 --> 00:08:25,550
not even like miss it because uh was
there's a few uh trying to remember

462
00:08:25,550 --> 00:08:25,560
there's a few uh trying to remember
 

463
00:08:25,560 --> 00:08:27,469
there's a few uh trying to remember
which book that talks about hiking that

464
00:08:27,469 --> 00:08:27,479
which book that talks about hiking that
 

465
00:08:27,479 --> 00:08:29,210
which book that talks about hiking that
Appalachian Trail

466
00:08:29,210 --> 00:08:29,220
Appalachian Trail
 

467
00:08:29,220 --> 00:08:31,129
Appalachian Trail
but you kind of miss those hot showers

468
00:08:31,129 --> 00:08:31,139
but you kind of miss those hot showers
 

469
00:08:31,139 --> 00:08:33,050
but you kind of miss those hot showers
but I have a sense like after a few

470
00:08:33,050 --> 00:08:33,060
but I have a sense like after a few
 

471
00:08:33,060 --> 00:08:35,029
but I have a sense like after a few
months after a few years well you use

472
00:08:35,029 --> 00:08:35,039
months after a few years well you use
 

473
00:08:35,039 --> 00:08:37,310
months after a few years well you use
your scale recalibrates yeah yeah I was

474
00:08:37,310 --> 00:08:37,320

that scale can go from one to ten and I
think it's hard to be a ten I think

I think trying to be above a five and
looking down at the things you have

more often than you are looking up at
the things you don't or being you know

00:24:23,330 --> 00:24:23,340
of nuclear war negative or positive
 

1411
00:24:23,340 --> 00:24:26,289
of nuclear war negative or positive
not in the case of a nuclear war but uh

1412
00:24:26,289 --> 00:24:26,299
not in the case of a nuclear war but uh
 

1413
00:24:26,299 --> 00:24:29,990
not in the case of a nuclear war but uh
the bioengineering

1414
00:24:29,990 --> 00:24:30,000
the bioengineering
 

1415
00:24:30,000 --> 00:24:32,870
the bioengineering
nanotech

1416
00:24:32,870 --> 00:24:32,880

1417
00:24:32,880 --> 00:24:35,029
nanotech
virology

1418
00:24:35,029 --> 00:24:35,039
virology
 

1419
00:24:35,039 --> 00:24:37,370
virology
what else is there maybe the structure

1420
00:24:37,370 --> 00:24:37,380
what else is there maybe the structure
 

1421
00:24:37,380 --> 00:24:39,950
what else is there maybe the structure
of governments and so on maybe the

1422
00:24:39,950 --> 00:24:39,960
of governments and so on maybe the
 

1423
00:24:39,960 --> 00:24:41,210
of governments and so on maybe the
structure of universities I don't know

1424
00:24:41,210 --> 00:24:41,220
structure of universities I don't know
 

1425
00:24:41,220 --> 00:24:42,770
structure of universities I don't know
there could be singular figures that

1426
00:24:42,770 --> 00:24:42,780
there could be singular figures that
 

1427
00:24:42,780 --> 00:24:45,770
there could be singular figures that
stand up and lead the way for human

1428
00:24:45,770 --> 00:24:45,780
stand up and lead the way for human
 

1429
00:24:45,780 --> 00:24:47,330
stand up and lead the way for human
there will be but I wonder if the

1430
00:24:47,330 --> 00:24:47,340
there will be but I wonder if the
 

1431
00:24:47,340 --> 00:24:49,490
there will be but I wonder if the
society is the thing that manifests that

1432
00:24:49,490 --> 00:24:49,500
society is the thing that manifests that
 

1433
00:24:49,500 --> 00:24:53,750
society is the thing that manifests that
that person or that person really does

1434
00:24:53,750 --> 00:24:53,760
that person or that person really does
 

1435
00:24:53,760 --> 00:24:56,330
that person or that person really does
have a huge impact I think it's probably

1436
00:24:56,330 --> 00:24:56,340
have a huge impact I think it's probably
 

1437
00:24:56,340 --> 00:24:58,190
have a huge impact I think it's probably
a spectrum where there are some cases

1438
00:24:58,190 --> 00:24:58,200
a spectrum where there are some cases
 

1439
00:24:58,200 --> 00:25:01,430
a spectrum where there are some cases
when a circumstance was such that

1440
00:25:01,430 --> 00:25:01,440
when a circumstance was such that
 

1441
00:25:01,440 --> 00:25:03,950
when a circumstance was such that
something like what happened was gonna

1442
00:25:03,950 --> 00:25:03,960
something like what happened was gonna
 

1443
00:25:03,960 --> 00:25:06,169
something like what happened was gonna
happen if you pluck that person from the

1444
00:25:06,169 --> 00:25:06,179
happen if you pluck that person from the
 

1445
00:25:06,179 --> 00:25:07,789
happen if you pluck that person from the
earth I don't know whether the Mongols

1446
00:25:07,789 --> 00:25:07,799
earth I don't know whether the Mongols
 

1447
00:25:07,799 --> 00:25:10,190
earth I don't know whether the Mongols
is a good example or not but maybe it

1448
00:25:10,190 --> 00:25:10,200
is a good example or not but maybe it
 

1449
00:25:10,200 --> 00:25:11,450
is a good example or not but maybe it
could be that if you plucked Genghis

1450
00:25:11,450 --> 00:25:11,460
could be that if you plucked Genghis
 

1451
00:25:11,460 --> 00:25:13,070
could be that if you plucked Genghis
Khan as a baby

1452
00:25:13,070 --> 00:25:13,080
Khan as a baby
 

1453
00:25:13,080 --> 00:25:16,010
Khan as a baby
there was because of the specific way

1454
00:25:16,010 --> 00:25:16,020
there was because of the specific way
 

1455
00:25:16,020 --> 00:25:17,930
there was because of the specific way
Chinese civilization was at that time

1456
00:25:17,930 --> 00:25:17,940
Chinese civilization was at that time
 

1457
00:25:17,940 --> 00:25:19,610
Chinese civilization was at that time
and the specific

1458
00:25:19,610 --> 00:25:19,620
and the specific
 

1459
00:25:19,620 --> 00:25:21,950
and the specific
you know climate you know that was that

1460
00:25:21,950 --> 00:25:21,960
you know climate you know that was that
 

1461
00:25:21,960 --> 00:25:23,270
you know climate you know that was that
was causing a certain kind of pressure

1462
00:25:23,270 --> 00:25:23,280
was causing a certain kind of pressure
 

1463
00:25:23,280 --> 00:25:25,070
was causing a certain kind of pressure
on the Mongols and the way they they

1464
00:25:25,070 --> 00:25:25,080
on the Mongols and the way they they
 

1465
00:25:25,080 --> 00:25:26,750
on the Mongols and the way they they
still had their great archers and they

1466
00:25:26,750 --> 00:25:26,760
still had their great archers and they
 

1467
00:25:26,760 --> 00:25:28,190
still had their great archers and they
had their horses and they had a lot of

1468
00:25:28,190 --> 00:25:28,200
had their horses and they had a lot of
 

1469
00:25:28,200 --> 00:25:29,810
had their horses and they had a lot of
the same advantages so maybe it was like

1470
00:25:29,810 --> 00:25:29,820
the same advantages so maybe it was like
 

1471
00:25:29,820 --> 00:25:31,610
the same advantages so maybe it was like
it was waiting to happen right it was

1472
00:25:31,610 --> 00:25:31,620
it was waiting to happen right it was
 

1473
00:25:31,620 --> 00:25:33,890
it was waiting to happen right it was
going to happen either way and uh may

1474
00:25:33,890 --> 00:25:33,900
going to happen either way and uh may
 

1475
00:25:33,900 --> 00:25:35,269
going to happen either way and uh may
not have happened to sit to the extent

1476
00:25:35,269 --> 00:25:35,279
not have happened to sit to the extent
 

1477
00:25:35,279 --> 00:25:37,070
not have happened to sit to the extent
or whatever so maybe or you could go the

1478
00:25:37,070 --> 00:25:37,080
or whatever so maybe or you could go the
 

1479
00:25:37,080 --> 00:25:38,210
or whatever so maybe or you could go the
full other direction and say actually

1480
00:25:38,210 --> 00:25:38,220
full other direction and say actually
 

1481
00:25:38,220 --> 00:25:41,090
full other direction and say actually
this was probably not gonna happen

1482
00:25:41,090 --> 00:25:41,100
this was probably not gonna happen
 

1483
00:25:41,100 --> 00:25:43,430
this was probably not gonna happen
um and you know I think World War II is

1484
00:25:43,430 --> 00:25:43,440
um and you know I think World War II is
 

1485
00:25:43,440 --> 00:25:45,409
um and you know I think World War II is
an example right I kind of think World

1486
00:25:45,409 --> 00:25:45,419
an example right I kind of think World
 

1487
00:25:45,419 --> 00:25:47,750
an example right I kind of think World
War II really was kind of the the work

1488
00:25:47,750 --> 00:25:47,760
War II really was kind of the the work
 

1489
00:25:47,760 --> 00:25:49,610
War II really was kind of the the work
of it of course it relied on all these

1490
00:25:49,610 --> 00:25:49,620
of it of course it relied on all these
 

1491
00:25:49,620 --> 00:25:50,870
of it of course it relied on all these
other circumstances you had to have the

1492
00:25:50,870 --> 00:25:50,880
other circumstances you had to have the
 

1493
00:25:50,880 --> 00:25:52,250
other circumstances you had to have the
resentment in German you have had the

1494
00:25:52,250 --> 00:25:52,260
resentment in German you have had the
 

1495
00:25:52,260 --> 00:25:54,769
resentment in German you have had the
Great Depression but like

1496
00:25:54,769 --> 00:25:54,779
Great Depression but like
 

1497
00:25:54,779 --> 00:25:56,269
Great Depression but like
um I think if you take Hitler out I'm

1498
00:25:56,269 --> 00:25:56,279
um I think if you take Hitler out I'm
 

1499
00:25:56,279 --> 00:25:57,710
um I think if you take Hitler out I'm
pretty sure World War One World War II

1500
00:25:57,710 --> 00:25:57,720
pretty sure World War One World War II
 

1501
00:25:57,720 --> 00:25:59,269
pretty sure World War One World War II
doesn't happen

1502
00:25:59,269 --> 00:25:59,279
doesn't happen
 

1503
00:25:59,279 --> 00:26:01,669
doesn't happen
well then it seems like easier to answer

1504
00:26:01,669 --> 00:26:01,679
well then it seems like easier to answer
 

1505
00:26:01,679 --> 00:26:03,169
well then it seems like easier to answer
these questions when you look at history

1506
00:26:03,169 --> 00:26:03,179
these questions when you look at history
 

1507
00:26:03,179 --> 00:26:04,909
these questions when you look at history
even recent history but let's look at

1508
00:26:04,909 --> 00:26:04,919
even recent history but let's look at
 

1509
00:26:04,919 --> 00:26:06,470
even recent history but let's look at
now let's look at I'm sure we'll talk

1510
00:26:06,470 --> 00:26:06,480
now let's look at I'm sure we'll talk

and then so there's like Larry Page so
 

1545
00:26:43,559 --> 00:26:45,769
and then so there's like Larry Page so
with Google that's kind of intermingled

1546
00:26:45,769 --> 00:26:45,779
with Google that's kind of intermingled
 

1547
00:26:45,779 --> 00:26:46,970
with Google that's kind of intermingled
into that whole thing into the

now Elon

1552
00:26:50,810 --> 00:26:50,820
now Elon
 

1553
00:26:50,820 --> 00:26:52,310
now Elon
um who else I mean there's people

1554
00:26:52,310 --> 00:26:52,320
um who else I mean there's people
 

1555
00:26:52,320 --> 00:26:54,470
um who else I mean there's people
playing with the evolution of social

1556
00:26:54,470 --> 00:26:54,480
playing with the evolution of social
 

1557
00:26:54,480 --> 00:26:58,610
playing with the evolution of social
media and to me that seems to be

1558
00:26:58,610 --> 00:26:58,620
media and to me that seems to be
 

1559
00:26:58,620 --> 00:27:01,789
media and to me that seems to be
connected to the development of AI and

1560
00:27:01,789 --> 00:27:01,799
connected to the development of AI and
 

1561
00:27:01,799 --> 00:27:03,470
connected to the development of AI and
it seems like those singular figures

1562
00:27:03,470 --> 00:27:03,480
it seems like those singular figures
 

1563
00:27:03,480 --> 00:27:05,570
it seems like those singular figures
will Define the direction of AI

1564
00:27:05,570 --> 00:27:05,580
will Define the direction of AI
 

1565
00:27:05,580 --> 00:27:07,430
will Define the direction of AI
development and social media development

1566
00:27:07,430 --> 00:27:07,440
development and social media development

um and you know there can be a little
 

1583
00:27:25,679 --> 00:27:27,409
um and you know there can be a little
meeting of three people at Facebook and

they come out and they come in they come
out of that meeting and make a decision

1588
00:27:29,870 --> 00:27:29,880

out of that meeting and make a decision
that totally changes the world right on

1590
00:27:32,630 --> 00:27:32,640
that totally changes the world right on
 

1591

same day right
 

1599

same day right
so that suggests that there's some

1600
00:27:43,430 --> 00:27:43,440
so that suggests that there's some
 

1601
00:27:43,440 --> 00:27:45,049
so that suggests that there's some
bigger force that is also kind of

1602
00:27:45,049 --> 00:27:45,059
bigger force that is also kind of
 

1603
00:27:45,059 --> 00:27:47,570
bigger force that is also kind of
driving them in which case it's less

right I mean to me leadership
is the ability to move things in a

is the ability to move things in a
direction that the cultural forces are

1614
00:27:58,669 --> 00:27:58,679
direction that the cultural forces are
 

1615
00:27:58,679 --> 00:28:01,010
direction that the cultural forces are
not already taking things right A lot of

00:28:01,010 --> 00:28:01,020
not already taking things right A lot of
 

1617
00:28:01,020 --> 00:28:03,110
not already taking things right A lot of
times people seem like a leader because

1618
00:28:03,110 --> 00:28:03,120
times people seem like a leader because
 

1619
00:28:03,120 --> 00:28:05,149
times people seem like a leader because
they're just kind of hopping on the

1620
00:28:05,149 --> 00:28:05,159
they're just kind of hopping on the
 

1621
00:28:05,159 --> 00:28:06,649
they're just kind of hopping on the
cultural wave and they happen to be the

1622
00:28:06,649 --> 00:28:06,659
cultural wave and they happen to be the
 

1623
00:28:06,659 --> 00:28:08,269
cultural wave and they happen to be the
person who gets to the top of it now it

1624
00:28:08,269 --> 00:28:08,279
person who gets to the top of it now it
 

1625
00:28:08,279 --> 00:28:09,830
person who gets to the top of it now it
seems like they're but actually the the

1626
00:28:09,830 --> 00:28:09,840
seems like they're but actually the the
 

1627
00:28:09,840 --> 00:28:12,649
seems like they're but actually the the
wave was already going like real

1628
00:28:12,649 --> 00:28:12,659
wave was already going like real
 

1629
00:28:12,659 --> 00:28:14,930
wave was already going like real
leadership is when

1630
00:28:14,930 --> 00:28:14,940
leadership is when
 

1631
00:28:14,940 --> 00:28:17,210
leadership is when
um is is when someone actually changes

1632
00:28:17,210 --> 00:28:17,220
um is is when someone actually changes
 

1633
00:28:17,220 --> 00:28:19,250
um is is when someone actually changes
the wave changes the shape of the wave

1634
00:28:19,250 --> 00:28:19,260
the wave changes the shape of the wave
 

1635
00:28:19,260 --> 00:28:22,070
the wave changes the shape of the wave
like I think Elon with you know SpaceX

1636
00:28:22,070 --> 00:28:22,080
like I think Elon with you know SpaceX
 

1637
00:28:22,080 --> 00:28:26,149
like I think Elon with you know SpaceX
and and with Tesla like genuinely like

1638
00:28:26,149 --> 00:28:26,159
and and with Tesla like genuinely like
 

1639
00:28:26,159 --> 00:28:28,190
and and with Tesla like genuinely like
shaped a wave you know maybe you could

1640
00:28:28,190 --> 00:28:28,200
shaped a wave you know maybe you could
 

1641
00:28:28,200 --> 00:28:29,810
shaped a wave you know maybe you could
say that EVS were actually like they

1642
00:28:29,810 --> 00:28:29,820
say that EVS were actually like they
 

1643
00:28:29,820 --> 00:28:31,130
say that EVS were actually like they
were gonna happen anyway but it's

1644
00:28:31,130 --> 00:28:31,140
were gonna happen anyway but it's
 

1645
00:28:31,140 --> 00:28:33,590
were gonna happen anyway but it's
there's no it's not much evidence about

1646
00:28:33,590 --> 00:28:33,600
there's no it's not much evidence about
 

1647
00:28:33,600 --> 00:28:35,810
there's no it's not much evidence about
at least happening when it did uh you

1648
00:28:35,810 --> 00:28:35,820
at least happening when it did uh you
 

1649
00:28:35,820 --> 00:28:37,070
at least happening when it did uh you
know if we end up on Mars you know you

1650
00:28:37,070 --> 00:28:37,080
know if we end up on Mars you know you
 

1651
00:28:37,080 --> 00:28:39,110
know if we end up on Mars you know you
can you can say that Elon was a genuine

1652
00:28:39,110 --> 00:28:39,120
can you can say that Elon was a genuine
 

1653
00:28:39,120 --> 00:28:40,970
can you can say that Elon was a genuine
like leader there and so there are

1654
00:28:40,970 --> 00:28:40,980
like leader there and so there are
 

1655
00:28:40,980 --> 00:28:42,830
like leader there and so there are
examples now like Zuckerberg definitely

1656
00:28:42,830 --> 00:28:42,840
examples now like Zuckerberg definitely
 

1657
00:28:42,840 --> 00:28:44,990
examples now like Zuckerberg definitely
has done a lot of leadership along the

1658
00:28:44,990 --> 00:28:45,000
has done a lot of leadership along the
 

1659
00:28:45,000 --> 00:28:45,950
has done a lot of leadership along the
way

1660
00:28:45,950 --> 00:28:45,960
way
 

1661
00:28:45,960 --> 00:28:47,810
way
he's also

1662
00:28:47,810 --> 00:28:47,820
he's also
 

1663
00:28:47,820 --> 00:28:50,930
he's also
um potentially kind of like caught in a

1664
00:28:50,930 --> 00:28:50,940
um potentially kind of like caught in a
 

1665
00:28:50,940 --> 00:28:52,909
um potentially kind of like caught in a
a storm that is happening and you know

1666
00:28:52,909 --> 00:28:52,919
a storm that is happening and you know
 

1667
00:28:52,919 --> 00:28:54,649
a storm that is happening and you know
he's one of the figures in it so I don't

1668
00:28:54,649 --> 00:28:54,659
he's one of the figures in it so I don't
 

1669
00:28:54,659 --> 00:28:57,649
he's one of the figures in it so I don't
know and it's possible that he is a big

1670
00:28:57,649 --> 00:28:57,659
know and it's possible that he is a big
 

1671
00:28:57,659 --> 00:28:59,390
know and it's possible that he is a big
shaper if the metaverse becomes a

1672
00:28:59,390 --> 00:28:59,400
shaper if the metaverse becomes a
 

1673
00:28:59,400 --> 00:29:01,909
shaper if the metaverse becomes a
reality if in 30 years we're all living

1674
00:29:01,909 --> 00:29:01,919
reality if in 30 years we're all living
 

1675
00:29:01,919 --> 00:29:03,950
reality if in 30 years we're all living
in a virtual world to many people it

1676
00:29:03,950 --> 00:29:03,960
in a virtual world to many people it
 

1677
00:29:03,960 --> 00:29:06,169
in a virtual world to many people it
seems ridiculous now that that was a

1678
00:29:06,169 --> 00:29:06,179
seems ridiculous now that that was a
 

1679
00:29:06,179 --> 00:29:08,149
seems ridiculous now that that was a
poor investment we talked about getting

1680
00:29:08,149 --> 00:29:08,159
poor investment we talked about getting
 

1681
00:29:08,159 --> 00:29:10,070
poor investment we talked about getting
you know 10 you know I think it was

1682
00:29:10,070 --> 00:29:10,080
you know 10 you know I think it was
 

1683
00:29:10,080 --> 00:29:11,630
you know 10 you know I think it was
something like a billion people with um

1684
00:29:11,630 --> 00:29:11,640
something like a billion people with um
 

1685
00:29:11,640 --> 00:29:13,850
something like a billion people with um
a VR headset in their pocket and by you

1686
00:29:13,850 --> 00:29:13,860
a VR headset in their pocket and by you
 

1687
00:29:13,860 --> 00:29:15,950
a VR headset in their pocket and by you
know I think 10 years from now back in

1688
00:29:15,950 --> 00:29:15,960
know I think 10 years from now back in
 

1689
00:29:15,960 --> 00:29:19,370
know I think 10 years from now back in
2015 so we're hyper behind that but when

1690
00:29:19,370 --> 00:29:19,380
2015 so we're hyper behind that but when
 

1691
00:29:19,380 --> 00:29:21,409
2015 so we're hyper behind that but when
I he was talking about that and honestly

1692
00:29:21,409 --> 00:29:21,419
I he was talking about that and honestly

00:29:23,930 --> 00:29:23,940
this is something I've been wrong about
 

1697
00:29:23,940 --> 00:29:26,690
this is something I've been wrong about
because I I went to like one of the

1698
00:29:26,690 --> 00:29:26,700
because I I went to like one of the
 

1699
00:29:26,700 --> 00:29:29,510
because I I went to like one of the
Facebook conferences and tried out all

1700
00:29:29,510 --> 00:29:29,520
Facebook conferences and tried out all

you know major players there because I
was going to write a big post about it

1708
00:29:35,450 --> 00:29:35,460
was going to write a big post about it
 

1709
00:29:35,460 --> 00:29:38,210
was going to write a big post about it
that then got swallowed by this book but

1710
00:29:38,210 --> 00:29:38,220
that then got swallowed by this book but
 

1711
00:29:38,220 --> 00:29:39,409
that then got swallowed by this book but
um but I would have been wrong in the

1712
00:29:39,409 --> 00:29:39,419
um but I would have been wrong in the
 

1713
00:29:39,419 --> 00:29:41,029
um but I would have been wrong in the
post because in what I would have said

1714
00:29:41,029 --> 00:29:41,039
post because in what I would have said
 

1715
00:29:41,039 --> 00:29:44,510
post because in what I would have said
was that this thing is when I tried it I

1716
00:29:44,510 --> 00:29:44,520
was that this thing is when I tried it I
 

1717
00:29:44,520 --> 00:29:46,970
was that this thing is when I tried it I
was like this is you know some of them

1809
00:31:07,380 --> 00:31:08,870
iPhone of honestly a little bit of a
Carmack type guy which is why it was

1810
00:31:08,870 --> 00:31:08,880
Carmack type guy which is why it was
 

1811
00:31:08,880 --> 00:31:10,010
Carmack type guy which is why it was
really interesting for him to be

1812

how do we create a simple dumb thing

1816
00:31:13,730 --> 00:31:13,740
how do we create a simple dumb thing
 

1817
00:31:13,740 --> 00:31:15,889
how do we create a simple dumb thing
that's a hundred bucks but actually

1818
00:31:15,889 --> 00:31:15,899
that's a hundred bucks but actually
 

1819
00:31:15,899 --> 00:31:17,810
that's a hundred bucks but actually
creates that experience and then there's

1820
00:31:17,810 --> 00:31:17,820
creates that experience and then there's
 

1821
00:31:17,820 --> 00:31:19,909
creates that experience and then there's
going to be some viral killer app on it

1822
00:31:19,909 --> 00:31:19,919
going to be some viral killer app on it
 

1823
00:31:19,919 --> 00:31:21,950
going to be some viral killer app on it
and that's going to be the Gateway into

1824
00:31:21,950 --> 00:31:21,960
and that's going to be the Gateway into
 

1825
00:31:21,960 --> 00:31:23,510
and that's going to be the Gateway into
a thing that's going to change

1826
00:31:23,510 --> 00:31:23,520
a thing that's going to change

everything with the personal computer
 

1833
00:31:29,000 --> 00:31:31,669
everything with the personal computer
does that understood why that maybe

1834
00:31:31,669 --> 00:31:31,679
does that understood why that maybe
 

1835
00:31:31,679 --> 00:31:35,510
does that understood why that maybe

MS-DOS when I was like kind of
 

1861
00:32:00,179 --> 00:32:02,029
MS-DOS when I was like kind of

their Peak didn't have and so I I wonder

2476
00:42:31,069 --> 00:42:31,079
their Peak didn't have and so I I wonder
 

2477

their Peak didn't have and so I I wonder
if those high stakes and Powers will

little like this feeling of political
and technological turmoil is is nothing

2488
00:42:47,150 --> 00:42:47,160
and technological turmoil is is nothing
 

2489
00:42:47,160 --> 00:42:49,550
and technological turmoil is is nothing
well that's the big question you could

2490
00:42:49,550 --> 00:42:49,560
well that's the big question you could

of it
 

2509
00:43:05,040 --> 00:43:06,650

um and it was over gold or silver being
 

2511
00:43:06,660 --> 00:43:08,030
um and it was over gold or silver being
this I don't know it was very it's

2512
00:43:08,030 --> 00:43:08,040
this I don't know it was very it's
 

2513
00:43:08,040 --> 00:43:09,349
this I don't know it was very it's
something that I don't understand but

2514
00:43:09,349 --> 00:43:09,359
something that I don't understand but
 

2515
00:43:09,359 --> 00:43:11,750
something that I don't understand but
the point is it was a little bit of a

2516
00:43:11,750 --> 00:43:11,760
the point is it was a little bit of a
 

2517
00:43:11,760 --> 00:43:13,309
the point is it was a little bit of a
blip right it happened it felt it must

2518
00:43:13,309 --> 00:43:13,319
blip right it happened it felt it must
 

2519
00:43:13,319 --> 00:43:14,569
blip right it happened it felt it must
have felt like the end of days at the

2520
00:43:14,569 --> 00:43:14,579
have felt like the end of days at the
 

2521
00:43:14,579 --> 00:43:16,849
have felt like the end of days at the
time and then now we most people don't

2522
00:43:16,849 --> 00:43:16,859
time and then now we most people don't
 

2523
00:43:16,859 --> 00:43:19,250
time and then now we most people don't
even know about that uh versus you know

2524
00:43:19,250 --> 00:43:19,260
even know about that uh versus you know
 

2525
00:43:19,260 --> 00:43:20,690
even know about that uh versus you know
again the Roman Empire actually

2526
00:43:20,690 --> 00:43:20,700
again the Roman Empire actually
 

2527
00:43:20,700 --> 00:43:22,730
again the Roman Empire actually
collapsed and so the the question is

2528
00:43:22,730 --> 00:43:22,740
collapsed and so the the question is
 

2529
00:43:22,740 --> 00:43:24,890
collapsed and so the the question is
just like is yeah you know will in 50

2530
00:43:24,890 --> 00:43:24,900
just like is yeah you know will in 50
 

2531
00:43:24,900 --> 00:43:27,109
just like is yeah you know will in 50
years will this be like or like

2532
00:43:27,109 --> 00:43:27,119
years will this be like or like
 

2533
00:43:27,119 --> 00:43:29,270
years will this be like or like
McCarthyism oh they had like uh oh that

2534
00:43:29,270 --> 00:43:29,280
McCarthyism oh they had like uh oh that
 

2535
00:43:29,280 --> 00:43:30,890
McCarthyism oh they had like uh oh that
was like a crazy few years in America

2536
00:43:30,890 --> 00:43:30,900
was like a crazy few years in America
 

2537
00:43:30,900 --> 00:43:32,510
was like a crazy few years in America
and then it was fine

2538
00:43:32,510 --> 00:43:32,520
and then it was fine
 

2539
00:43:32,520 --> 00:43:34,130
and then it was fine
um or is this the beginning of something

2540
00:43:34,130 --> 00:43:34,140
um or is this the beginning of something
 

2541
00:43:34,140 --> 00:43:36,950
um or is this the beginning of something
really big and then that's what

2542
00:43:36,950 --> 00:43:36,960
really big and then that's what
 

2543
00:43:36,960 --> 00:43:39,470
really big and then that's what
well I wonder if we can predict uh what

2544
00:43:39,470 --> 00:43:39,480
well I wonder if we can predict uh what
 

2545
00:43:39,480 --> 00:43:41,390
well I wonder if we can predict uh what
the big thing is at the beginning it

2546
00:43:41,390 --> 00:43:41,400
the big thing is at the beginning it
 

2547
00:43:41,400 --> 00:43:42,950
the big thing is at the beginning it
feels like we're not we're just here

2557
00:43:51,960 --> 00:43:54,109
the that's the one thing I know for sure
is that we need to have our wits about

2558
00:43:54,109 --> 00:43:54,119
is that we need to have our wits about

00:44:01,010 --> 00:44:01,020
why is this possible Right to proceed
 

2565
00:44:01,020 --> 00:44:03,109

do it I probably can't but there's some

00:44:16,550 --> 00:44:16,560
do it I probably can't but there's some
 

2579

I think wisdom and you talk about this

2580
00:44:19,190 --> 00:44:19,200
I think wisdom and you talk about this
 

2581
00:44:19,200 --> 00:44:21,490
I think wisdom and you talk about this
can come with a false confidence

2582
00:44:21,490 --> 00:44:21,500
can come with a false confidence
 

2583
00:44:21,500 --> 00:44:23,630
can come with a false confidence
arrogance I mean you talk about this in

2584
00:44:23,630 --> 00:44:23,640
arrogance I mean you talk about this in
 

2585
00:44:23,640 --> 00:44:25,250
arrogance I mean you talk about this in
the book that's too easy that's not

2586
00:44:25,250 --> 00:44:25,260
the book that's too easy that's not
 

2587
00:44:25,260 --> 00:44:26,990
the book that's too easy that's not
wisdom then if you're being arrogant

2588
00:44:26,990 --> 00:44:27,000
wisdom then if you're being arrogant
 

2589
00:44:27,000 --> 00:44:29,150
wisdom then if you're being arrogant
you're being unwise unwise yeah you know

2590
00:44:29,150 --> 00:44:29,160
you're being unwise unwise yeah you know
 

2591
00:44:29,160 --> 00:44:30,770
you're being unwise unwise yeah you know
I think I think wisdom is doing what

2592
00:44:30,770 --> 00:44:30,780
I think I think wisdom is doing what
 

2593
00:44:30,780 --> 00:44:32,450
I think I think wisdom is doing what
people a hundred years from now with the

2594
00:44:32,450 --> 00:44:32,460
people a hundred years from now with the
 

2595
00:44:32,460 --> 00:44:35,089
people a hundred years from now with the
hindsight that we don't have would do if

2596
00:44:35,089 --> 00:44:35,099
hindsight that we don't have would do if
 

2597
00:44:35,099 --> 00:44:35,990
hindsight that we don't have would do if
they could come back in time and they

2598
00:44:35,990 --> 00:44:36,000
they could come back in time and they
 

2599
00:44:36,000 --> 00:44:36,950
they could come back in time and they
knew everything it's like how do we

2600
00:44:36,950 --> 00:44:36,960
knew everything it's like how do we
 

2601
00:44:36,960 --> 00:44:38,990
knew everything it's like how do we
figure out how to have hindsight when we

2602
00:44:38,990 --> 00:44:39,000
figure out how to have hindsight when we
 

2603
00:44:39,000 --> 00:44:41,569
figure out how to have hindsight when we
actually are not what if stupidity is

2604
00:44:41,569 --> 00:44:41,579
actually are not what if stupidity is
 

2605
00:44:41,579 --> 00:44:43,609
actually are not what if stupidity is
the thing that people from 100 years

2606
00:44:43,609 --> 00:44:43,619
the thing that people from 100 years
 

2607
00:44:43,619 --> 00:44:47,109
the thing that people from 100 years
from now will see us wise

2608
00:44:47,109 --> 00:44:47,119

 

2609
00:44:47,119 --> 00:44:49,730

being naive and uh trusting everybody

2610
00:44:49,730 --> 00:44:49,740
being naive and uh trusting everybody
 

2611
00:44:49,740 --> 00:44:51,710
being naive and uh trusting everybody
maybe that well then you get lucky then

2612
00:44:51,710 --> 00:44:51,720
maybe that well then you get lucky then
 

2613
00:44:51,720 --> 00:44:53,510
maybe that well then you get lucky then
then you you know then maybe you get to

2614
00:44:53,510 --> 00:44:53,520
then you you know then maybe you get to
 

2615
00:44:53,520 --> 00:44:55,490
then you you know then maybe you get to
a good a good future by stumbling upon

2616
00:44:55,490 --> 00:44:55,500
a good a good future by stumbling upon
 

2617
00:44:55,500 --> 00:44:56,630
a good a good future by stumbling upon
it

2618
00:44:56,630 --> 00:44:56,640
it
 

2619
00:44:56,640 --> 00:44:58,910
it
um but ideally you you can get there

2620
00:44:58,910 --> 00:44:58,920
um but ideally you you can get there
 

2621
00:44:58,920 --> 00:45:02,329
um but ideally you you can get there
like I think a lot of we America the

like I think a lot of we America the
 

2623
00:45:02,339 --> 00:45:04,910
like I think a lot of we America the
great things about it are a product of

great things about it are a product of
 

2625
00:45:04,920 --> 00:45:07,190
great things about it are a product of
the wisdom of previous Americans you

2626

know pretty wise system to set up
 

2631
00:45:12,240 --> 00:45:14,569
know pretty wise system to set up
there's not much stupid stumbling around

2632
00:45:14,569 --> 00:45:14,579
there's not much stupid stumbling around
 

2633
00:45:14,579 --> 00:45:17,690
there's not much stupid stumbling around
well there is I mean with the Huskies uh

you err on the side
of love

2642
00:45:28,790 --> 00:45:28,800
of love
 

2643

and almost like a naive trust in other
human beings and that turns out to be at

2646
00:45:34,010 --> 00:45:34,020

instead of one foot and that to me is
 

2671
00:45:56,460 --> 00:45:59,890

that works out but I feel like there's
 

2693
00:46:21,079 --> 00:46:23,990
that works out but I feel like there's
intermixing of metaphors that works okay

there and that is
 

2761
00:47:42,119 --> 00:47:44,270
there and that is
that that's a different question you

2762

that that's a different question you
 

2763
00:47:44,280 --> 00:47:46,490
that that's a different question you
know so the the unimaginably good future

00:48:20,990 --> 00:48:21,000
and the big question is I actually don't
 

2803
00:48:21,000 --> 00:48:23,089
and the big question is I actually don't
I I don't try to say here's the way to

2804
00:48:23,089 --> 00:48:23,099
I I don't try to say here's the way to
 

2805
00:48:23,099 --> 00:48:25,430
I I don't try to say here's the way to
get there here's the actual specific way

2806
00:48:25,430 --> 00:48:25,440
get there here's the actual specific way
 

2807
00:48:25,440 --> 00:48:28,190
get there here's the actual specific way
to get there I try to say how do we have

2808
00:48:28,190 --> 00:48:28,200
to get there I try to say how do we have
 

2809
00:48:28,200 --> 00:48:29,630
to get there I try to say how do we have
a flashlight so that we can together

2810
00:48:29,630 --> 00:48:29,640
a flashlight so that we can together
 

2811
00:48:29,640 --> 00:48:31,370
a flashlight so that we can together
figure it out like how do we give

2812
00:48:31,370 --> 00:48:31,380
figure it out like how do we give
 

2813
00:48:31,380 --> 00:48:32,930
figure it out like how do we give
ourselves the best chance of figuring

2814
00:48:32,930 --> 00:48:32,940
ourselves the best chance of figuring
 

2815
00:48:32,940 --> 00:48:34,250
ourselves the best chance of figuring
out the way to get there and I think

2816
00:48:34,250 --> 00:48:34,260
out the way to get there and I think
 

2817
00:48:34,260 --> 00:48:37,069
out the way to get there and I think
part of the problem with with Communists

2818
00:48:37,069 --> 00:48:37,079
part of the problem with with Communists
 

2819
00:48:37,079 --> 00:48:39,410
part of the problem with with Communists
um and people is ideologues is that

2820
00:48:39,410 --> 00:48:39,420
um and people is ideologues is that
 

2821
00:48:39,420 --> 00:48:41,450
um and people is ideologues is that
they're they're way too overconfident

2822
00:48:41,450 --> 00:48:41,460
they're they're way too overconfident
 

2823
00:48:41,460 --> 00:48:43,849
they're they're way too overconfident
that they know the way to get there and

2824
00:48:43,849 --> 00:48:43,859
that they know the way to get there and
 

2825
00:48:43,859 --> 00:48:45,710
that they know the way to get there and
and it's it becomes a religion to them

2826
00:48:45,710 --> 00:48:45,720
and it's it becomes a religion to them
 

2827
00:48:45,720 --> 00:48:48,109
and it's it becomes a religion to them
this solution and then you're not you

2828
00:48:48,109 --> 00:48:48,119
this solution and then you're not you
 

2829
00:48:48,119 --> 00:48:49,790
this solution and then you're not you
can't update once you have a solution as

2830
00:48:49,790 --> 00:48:49,800
can't update once you have a solution as
 

2831
00:48:49,800 --> 00:48:52,069
can't update once you have a solution as
a religion and so I felt a little

2832
00:48:52,069 --> 00:48:52,079
a religion and so I felt a little
 

2833
00:48:52,079 --> 00:48:53,809
a religion and so I felt a little
violated when you said Communists and

2834
00:48:53,809 --> 00:48:53,819
violated when you said Communists and
 

2835
00:48:53,819 --> 00:48:56,510
violated when you said Communists and
stare deeply into myself

2836
00:48:56,510 --> 00:48:56,520
stare deeply into myself
 

2837
00:48:56,520 --> 00:48:57,650
stare deeply into myself
um

2838
00:48:57,650 --> 00:48:57,660
um
 

2839
00:48:57,660 --> 00:48:59,150
um
in this book you've developed a

2840
00:48:59,150 --> 00:48:59,160
in this book you've developed a
 

2841
00:48:59,160 --> 00:49:02,510
in this book you've developed a
framework for how to fix everything

2842
00:49:02,510 --> 00:49:02,520
framework for how to fix everything
 

2843
00:49:02,520 --> 00:49:04,250
framework for how to fix everything
um it's called the latter can you

2844
00:49:04,250 --> 00:49:04,260
um it's called the latter can you
 

2845
00:49:04,260 --> 00:49:05,690
um it's called the latter can you
explain it okay it's not a framework for

2846
00:49:05,690 --> 00:49:05,700
explain it okay it's not a framework for
 

2847
00:49:05,700 --> 00:49:07,849
explain it okay it's not a framework for
how to fix everything just I would never

2848
00:49:07,849 --> 00:49:07,859
how to fix everything just I would never
 

2849
00:49:07,859 --> 00:49:09,530
how to fix everything just I would never
say that I'll explain it to Tim Urban at

2850
00:49:09,530 --> 00:49:09,540
say that I'll explain it to Tim Urban at
 

2851
00:49:09,540 --> 00:49:11,089
say that I'll explain it to Tim Urban at
some point okay how this humor thing

2852
00:49:11,089 --> 00:49:11,099
some point okay how this humor thing
 

2853
00:49:11,099 --> 00:49:15,589
some point okay how this humor thing
works yeah framework of uh how to think

2854
00:49:15,589 --> 00:49:15,599
works yeah framework of uh how to think
 

2855
00:49:15,599 --> 00:49:18,170
works yeah framework of uh how to think
about collaboration between humans such

2856
00:49:18,170 --> 00:49:18,180
about collaboration between humans such
 

2857
00:49:18,180 --> 00:49:20,569
about collaboration between humans such
that we could fix things I think it's a

2858
00:49:20,569 --> 00:49:20,579
that we could fix things I think it's a
 

2859
00:49:20,579 --> 00:49:23,930
that we could fix things I think it's a
compass it's like uh it's like a

2860
00:49:23,930 --> 00:49:23,940
compass it's like uh it's like a
 

2861
00:49:23,940 --> 00:49:27,170
compass it's like uh it's like a
it's a ruler that we can once we look at

2862
00:49:27,170 --> 00:49:27,180
it's a ruler that we can once we look at
 

2863
00:49:27,180 --> 00:49:28,609
it's a ruler that we can once we look at
it together and see what it is we can

2864
00:49:28,609 --> 00:49:28,619
it together and see what it is we can
 

2865
00:49:28,619 --> 00:49:29,870
it together and see what it is we can
all say oh we want to go to that side of

2866
00:49:29,870 --> 00:49:29,880
all say oh we want to go to that side of
 

2867
00:49:29,880 --> 00:49:32,150
all say oh we want to go to that side of
the ruler sure not this side

2868
00:49:32,150 --> 00:49:32,160
the ruler sure not this side
 

2869
00:49:32,160 --> 00:49:34,490
the ruler sure not this side
um and so it gives us a direction to go

2870
00:49:34,490 --> 00:49:34,500
um and so it gives us a direction to go
 

2871
00:49:34,500 --> 00:49:36,710
um and so it gives us a direction to go
and so what are the parts of the ladder

2872
00:49:36,710 --> 00:49:36,720
and so what are the parts of the ladder
 

2873
00:49:36,720 --> 00:49:38,510
and so what are the parts of the ladder
so I have these two characters this

2874
00:49:38,510 --> 00:49:38,520
so I have these two characters this
 

2875
00:49:38,520 --> 00:49:41,390
so I have these two characters this
orange guy this primitive mind is this

00:49:41,390 --> 00:49:41,400
orange guy this primitive mind is this
 

2877
00:49:41,400 --> 00:49:43,250
orange guy this primitive mind is this
is our software that is the software

2878
00:49:43,250 --> 00:49:43,260
is our software that is the software

that was in a 50 000 BC person's head

2880
00:49:47,510 --> 00:49:47,520
that was in a 50 000 BC person's head
 

2881
00:49:47,520 --> 00:49:50,630
that was in a 50 000 BC person's head
that was specifically optimized for to

2882
00:49:50,630 --> 00:49:50,640
that was specifically optimized for to
 

2883
00:49:50,640 --> 00:49:52,309
that was specifically optimized for to
help that person survive in that world

2884
00:49:52,309 --> 00:49:52,319
help that person survive in that world
 

2885
00:49:52,319 --> 00:49:53,930
help that person survive in that world
and not even not just not really survive

2886
00:49:53,930 --> 00:49:53,940
and not even not just not really survive
 

2887
00:49:53,940 --> 00:49:55,490
and not even not just not really survive
but help them pass their genes on in

2888
00:49:55,490 --> 00:49:55,500
but help them pass their genes on in
 

2889
00:49:55,500 --> 00:49:57,349
but help them pass their genes on in

that world
 

2891
00:49:57,359 --> 00:49:58,010
that world
um

2892
00:49:58,010 --> 00:49:58,020
um
 

2893
00:49:58,020 --> 00:49:59,690
um
and

2894
00:49:59,690 --> 00:49:59,700
and
 

2895
00:49:59,700 --> 00:50:02,750
and
civilization happened quickly and brains

2896
00:50:02,750 --> 00:50:02,760
civilization happened quickly and brains
 

2897
00:50:02,760 --> 00:50:06,349
civilization happened quickly and brains
changed slowly and so that unchanged

2898
00:50:06,349 --> 00:50:06,359
changed slowly and so that unchanged

it's obviously bad for you and it's
 

2911
00:50:19,020 --> 00:50:19,910
it's obviously bad for you and it's
because

the Primitive mind
 

2915
00:50:21,720 --> 00:50:24,290
the Primitive mind
in the world that it was programmed for

2916
00:50:24,290 --> 00:50:24,300
in the world that it was programmed for
 

2917
00:50:24,300 --> 00:50:26,450
in the world that it was programmed for
there was no Skittles and it was just

2918
00:50:26,450 --> 00:50:26,460
there was no Skittles and it was just
 

2919
00:50:26,460 --> 00:50:28,190

you get a little fat that would be the
 

2931
00:50:39,720 --> 00:50:41,630
you get a little fat that would be the
dream and now we're so good with energy

2932
00:50:41,630 --> 00:50:41,640
dream and now we're so good with energy
 

2933
00:50:41,640 --> 00:50:43,069
dream and now we're so good with energy
for a while we don't have to stress

2934
00:50:43,069 --> 00:50:43,079
for a while we don't have to stress
 

2935
00:50:43,079 --> 00:50:47,630
for a while we don't have to stress
about it anymore so today Mars Inc is

2936
00:50:47,630 --> 00:50:47,640
about it anymore so today Mars Inc is
 

2937
00:50:47,640 --> 00:50:50,450
about it anymore so today Mars Inc is
clever and says let's not sell things to

2938
00:50:50,450 --> 00:50:50,460
clever and says let's not sell things to
 

2939

character let's sell the people's
primitive Minds primitive minds are dumb

2944
00:50:55,069 --> 00:50:55,079
primitive Minds primitive minds are dumb
 

2945
00:50:55,079 --> 00:50:56,750
primitive Minds primitive minds are dumb
and let's trick them into thinking this

2946
00:50:56,750 --> 00:50:56,760
and let's trick them into thinking this
 

2947
00:50:56,760 --> 00:50:58,490
and let's trick them into thinking this
is this new this this thing you should

2948
00:50:58,490 --> 00:50:58,500
is this new this this thing you should
 

2949
00:50:58,500 --> 00:51:00,829
is this new this this thing you should
eat and then they'll eat it now Mars Inc

2950
00:51:00,829 --> 00:51:00,839
eat and then they'll eat it now Mars Inc
 

2951
00:51:00,839 --> 00:51:02,390
eat and then they'll eat it now Mars Inc
is a huge company actually just a little

2952
00:51:02,390 --> 00:51:02,400
is a huge company actually just a little
 

2953
00:51:02,400 --> 00:51:04,250
is a huge company actually just a little
real quick see you said primitive mind

2954
00:51:04,250 --> 00:51:04,260
real quick see you said primitive mind
 

2955
00:51:04,260 --> 00:51:05,510
real quick see you said primitive mind
and higher mind so those are the two

2956
00:51:05,510 --> 00:51:05,520
and higher mind so those are the two
 

2957
00:51:05,520 --> 00:51:06,890
and higher mind so those are the two
things that make up

2958
00:51:06,890 --> 00:51:06,900
things that make up
 

2959
00:51:06,900 --> 00:51:09,230
things that make up
this bigger mind that it that is the

2960
00:51:09,230 --> 00:51:09,240
this bigger mind that it that is the
 

2961
00:51:09,240 --> 00:51:11,150
this bigger mind that it that is the
modern human being yeah it's like you

2962
00:51:11,150 --> 00:51:11,160
modern human being yeah it's like you
 

2963
00:51:11,160 --> 00:51:12,530
modern human being yeah it's like you
know it's not perfect obviously there's

2964
00:51:12,530 --> 00:51:12,540
know it's not perfect obviously there's
 

2965
00:51:12,540 --> 00:51:14,329
know it's not perfect obviously there's
a lot of crossover um there's people who

2966
00:51:14,329 --> 00:51:14,339
a lot of crossover um there's people who
 

2967
00:51:14,339 --> 00:51:15,530
a lot of crossover um there's people who
will yell at me for saying there's two

2968
00:51:15,530 --> 00:51:15,540
will yell at me for saying there's two
 

2969
00:51:15,540 --> 00:51:17,510
will yell at me for saying there's two
minds and you know that but to me it's

2970
00:51:17,510 --> 00:51:17,520
minds and you know that but to me it's
 

2971
00:51:17,520 --> 00:51:19,730
minds and you know that but to me it's
just still a useful framework where you

2972
00:51:19,730 --> 00:51:19,740
just still a useful framework where you
 

2973
00:51:19,740 --> 00:51:21,530
just still a useful framework where you
have this software that has making

2974
00:51:21,530 --> 00:51:21,540
have this software that has making
 

2975
00:51:21,540 --> 00:51:23,569
have this software that has making
decisions based on a world that you're

2976
00:51:23,569 --> 00:51:23,579
decisions based on a world that you're
 

2977
00:51:23,579 --> 00:51:26,270
decisions based on a world that you're
not in anymore and then you've got this

2978
00:51:26,270 --> 00:51:26,280
not in anymore and then you've got this
 

2979
00:51:26,280 --> 00:51:27,410
not in anymore and then you've got this
other character I call it the higher

2980
00:51:27,410 --> 00:51:27,420
other character I call it the higher
 

2981
00:51:27,420 --> 00:51:28,849
other character I call it the higher
mind and it's the part of you that knows

2982
00:51:28,849 --> 00:51:28,859
mind and it's the part of you that knows
 

2983
00:51:28,859 --> 00:51:30,170
mind and it's the part of you that knows
that skills are not good and can

2984
00:51:30,170 --> 00:51:30,180
that skills are not good and can
 

2985
00:51:30,180 --> 00:51:32,030
that skills are not good and can
override the Instinct and the reason you

2986
00:51:32,030 --> 00:51:32,040
override the Instinct and the reason you
 

2987
00:51:32,040 --> 00:51:33,230
override the Instinct and the reason you
don't always eat Skittles is because the

2988
00:51:33,230 --> 00:51:33,240
don't always eat Skittles is because the
 

2989
00:51:33,240 --> 00:51:34,849
don't always eat Skittles is because the
higher Minds says no no no we're not

2990
00:51:34,849 --> 00:51:34,859
higher Minds says no no no we're not
 

2991
00:51:34,859 --> 00:51:36,770
higher Minds says no no no we're not
doing that because that's bad and I know

2992
00:51:36,770 --> 00:51:36,780
doing that because that's bad and I know
 

2993
00:51:36,780 --> 00:51:39,170
doing that because that's bad and I know
that right now you can apply that to a

2994
00:51:39,170 --> 00:51:39,180
that right now you can apply that to a
 

2995
00:51:39,180 --> 00:51:40,370
that right now you can apply that to a
lot of things the higher Minds the one

2996
00:51:40,370 --> 00:51:40,380
lot of things the higher Minds the one
 

2997
00:51:40,380 --> 00:51:41,690
lot of things the higher Minds the one
that knows I shouldn't procrastinate the

2998

that knows I shouldn't procrastinate the
 

2999
00:51:41,700 --> 00:51:42,829
that knows I shouldn't procrastinate the
Primitive Minds the one that wants to

3000
00:51:42,829 --> 00:51:42,839
Primitive Minds the one that wants to
 

3001
00:51:42,839 --> 00:51:44,750

procrastinates that you know you can
 

3007
00:51:47,880 --> 00:51:51,230
procrastinates that you know you can
apply this no I in this book apply it to

3008
00:51:51,230 --> 00:51:51,240
apply this no I in this book apply it to
 

3009
00:51:51,240 --> 00:51:51,910
apply this no I in this book apply it to
um

3010
00:51:51,910 --> 00:51:51,920
um
 

3011
00:51:51,920 --> 00:51:54,710
um
to how we form our beliefs is one of the

3012
00:51:54,710 --> 00:51:54,720
to how we form our beliefs is one of the
 

3013
00:51:54,720 --> 00:51:56,089
to how we form our beliefs is one of the
ways and then eventually the politics

3014
00:51:56,089 --> 00:51:56,099
ways and then eventually the politics
 

3015
00:51:56,099 --> 00:51:57,829
ways and then eventually the politics
and political movements but like

3016
00:51:57,829 --> 00:51:57,839
and political movements but like
 

3017
00:51:57,839 --> 00:51:59,390
and political movements but like
if you think about what well what's the

3018
00:51:59,390 --> 00:51:59,400
if you think about what well what's the
 

3019
00:51:59,400 --> 00:52:02,329
if you think about what well what's the
equivalent of the Skittles tug of war in

3020
00:52:02,329 --> 00:52:02,339
equivalent of the Skittles tug of war in
 

3021
00:52:02,339 --> 00:52:04,190
equivalent of the Skittles tug of war in
your head for how do you form your

3022
00:52:04,190 --> 00:52:04,200
your head for how do you form your
 

3023
00:52:04,200 --> 00:52:05,569
your head for how do you form your
beliefs

3024
00:52:05,569 --> 00:52:05,579
beliefs

beliefs
um

3026
00:52:06,170 --> 00:52:06,180
um
 

3027
00:52:06,180 --> 00:52:10,370
um
and it's that the Primitive mind in the

3028
00:52:10,370 --> 00:52:10,380
and it's that the Primitive mind in the
 

3029
00:52:10,380 --> 00:52:13,849
and it's that the Primitive mind in the
world that it was optimized for

3030
00:52:13,849 --> 00:52:13,859
world that it was optimized for
 

3031
00:52:13,859 --> 00:52:17,109
world that it was optimized for
um it wanted to

3032
00:52:17,109 --> 00:52:17,119
um it wanted to
 

3033
00:52:17,119 --> 00:52:20,990
um it wanted to
feel conviction about its beliefs it

3034
00:52:20,990 --> 00:52:21,000
feel conviction about its beliefs it
 

3035
00:52:21,000 --> 00:52:25,670
feel conviction about its beliefs it
wanted to be sure that it was

3036
00:52:25,670 --> 00:52:25,680
wanted to be sure that it was
 

3037
00:52:25,680 --> 00:52:27,410
wanted to be sure that it was
um I wanted to feel conviction and it

3038
00:52:27,410 --> 00:52:27,420
um I wanted to feel conviction and it
 

3039
00:52:27,420 --> 00:52:28,549
um I wanted to feel conviction and it
wanted to agree with the people around

3040
00:52:28,549 --> 00:52:28,559
wanted to agree with the people around
 

3041
00:52:28,559 --> 00:52:30,049
wanted to agree with the people around
there didn't want to stand out it wanted

3042
00:52:30,049 --> 00:52:30,059
there didn't want to stand out it wanted
 

3043
00:52:30,059 --> 00:52:31,970
there didn't want to stand out it wanted
to to perfectly agree with the tribe

3044
00:52:31,970 --> 00:52:31,980
to to perfectly agree with the tribe
 

3045

about the tribe's sacred beliefs right
 

3047
00:52:33,599 --> 00:52:35,089
about the tribe's sacred beliefs right
and so there's a big part of us that

3048
00:52:35,089 --> 00:52:35,099
and so there's a big part of us that
 

3049
00:52:35,099 --> 00:52:36,650
and so there's a big part of us that
wants to do that that doesn't like

3050
00:52:36,650 --> 00:52:36,660
wants to do that that doesn't like
 

3051
00:52:36,660 --> 00:52:37,849
wants to do that that doesn't like
changing our mind it feels like it's

3052
00:52:37,849 --> 00:52:37,859
changing our mind it feels like it's
 

3053
00:52:37,859 --> 00:52:39,170
changing our mind it feels like it's
part of our the Primitive mind

3054
00:52:39,170 --> 00:52:39,180
part of our the Primitive mind
 

3055
00:52:39,180 --> 00:52:41,210
part of our the Primitive mind
identifies with beliefs feels like it's

3056
00:52:41,210 --> 00:52:41,220
identifies with beliefs feels like it's
 

3057
00:52:41,220 --> 00:52:43,910
identifies with beliefs feels like it's
a threat a physical threat to you to

3058
00:52:43,910 --> 00:52:43,920
a threat a physical threat to you to
 

3059
00:52:43,920 --> 00:52:45,410
a threat a physical threat to you to
your primitive mind when you change your

3060
00:52:45,410 --> 00:52:45,420
your primitive mind when you change your
 

3061
00:52:45,420 --> 00:52:47,569
your primitive mind when you change your
mind or when someone disagrees with you

3062
00:52:47,569 --> 00:52:47,579
mind or when someone disagrees with you
 

3063
00:52:47,579 --> 00:52:49,910
mind or when someone disagrees with you
in a smart way so there's that huge

3064
00:52:49,910 --> 00:52:49,920
in a smart way so there's that huge
 

3065
00:52:49,920 --> 00:52:51,530
in a smart way so there's that huge
force in us which is confirmation bias

3066
00:52:51,530 --> 00:52:51,540
force in us which is confirmation bias
 

3067
00:52:51,540 --> 00:52:53,030
force in us which is confirmation bias
that's where that comes from it's it's

3068
00:52:53,030 --> 00:52:53,040
that's where that comes from it's it's
 

3069
00:52:53,040 --> 00:52:55,670
that's where that comes from it's it's
this this desire to keep believing what

3070
00:52:55,670 --> 00:52:55,680
this this desire to keep believing what
 

3071
00:52:55,680 --> 00:52:58,730
this this desire to keep believing what
we believe and this desire to also fit

3072
00:52:58,730 --> 00:52:58,740
we believe and this desire to also fit
 

3073
00:52:58,740 --> 00:53:00,170
we believe and this desire to also fit
in with our beliefs to believe what the

3074
00:53:00,170 --> 00:53:00,180
in with our beliefs to believe what the
 

3075
00:53:00,180 --> 00:53:02,809
in with our beliefs to believe what the
people around us believe and that can be

3076
00:53:02,809 --> 00:53:02,819
people around us believe and that can be
 

3077
00:53:02,819 --> 00:53:04,849
people around us believe and that can be
fun in some ways we all like the same

3078
00:53:04,849 --> 00:53:04,859
fun in some ways we all like the same
 

3079
00:53:04,859 --> 00:53:06,530
fun in some ways we all like the same
sports team and we're all super into it

3080
00:53:06,530 --> 00:53:06,540
sports team and we're all super into it
 

3081
00:53:06,540 --> 00:53:08,030
sports team and we're all super into it
and we're all gonna be biased about that

3082
00:53:08,030 --> 00:53:08,040
and we're all gonna be biased about that
 

3083
00:53:08,040 --> 00:53:09,530
and we're all gonna be biased about that
call together I mean that it's not

3084
00:53:09,530 --> 00:53:09,540
call together I mean that it's not
 

3085
00:53:09,540 --> 00:53:12,290
call together I mean that it's not
always bad but um it's not a very smart

3086
00:53:12,290 --> 00:53:12,300
always bad but um it's not a very smart
 

3087
00:53:12,300 --> 00:53:14,390
always bad but um it's not a very smart
way to be and it you're actually you're

3088
00:53:14,390 --> 00:53:14,400
way to be and it you're actually you're
 

3089
00:53:14,400 --> 00:53:16,130
way to be and it you're actually you're
working kind of for those ideas those

3090
00:53:16,130 --> 00:53:16,140
working kind of for those ideas those
 

3091
00:53:16,140 --> 00:53:17,690
working kind of for those ideas those
ideas are like your boss and you're

00:53:19,849 --> 00:53:19,859
working so hard to keep believing those
 

3095
00:53:19,859 --> 00:53:21,950
working so hard to keep believing those
those ideas are you know a really paper

3096
00:53:21,950 --> 00:53:21,960
those ideas are you know a really paper
 

3097
00:53:21,960 --> 00:53:23,510
those ideas are you know a really paper
comes in that you read that that

3098
00:53:23,510 --> 00:53:23,520
comes in that you read that that
 

3099
00:53:23,520 --> 00:53:25,250
comes in that you read that that
conflicts with those ideas and you will

3100
00:53:25,250 --> 00:53:25,260
conflicts with those ideas and you will
 

3101
00:53:25,260 --> 00:53:27,170
conflicts with those ideas and you will
do all this work to say that paper is

3102
00:53:27,170 --> 00:53:27,180
do all this work to say that paper is
 

3103
00:53:27,180 --> 00:53:29,410
do all this work to say that paper is
[\h__\h] because

3104

you're a faithful employee of those
 

3107
00:53:31,859 --> 00:53:34,670
you're a faithful employee of those
ideas now the higher mind to me the same

party that can override the Skittles can
 

3111
00:53:36,059 --> 00:53:38,390
party that can override the Skittles can
override this and can and can search for

3112
00:53:38,390 --> 00:53:38,400
override this and can and can search for
 

3113
00:53:38,400 --> 00:53:39,410
override this and can and can search for
something that makes a lot more sense

3114
00:53:39,410 --> 00:53:39,420
something that makes a lot more sense
 

3115
00:53:39,420 --> 00:53:42,230
something that makes a lot more sense
which is Truth uh because what rational

3116
00:53:42,230 --> 00:53:42,240
which is Truth uh because what rational
 

3117
00:53:42,240 --> 00:53:43,790
which is Truth uh because what rational
being wouldn't want to know the truth

3118
00:53:43,790 --> 00:53:43,800
being wouldn't want to know the truth
 

3119
00:53:43,800 --> 00:53:46,130
being wouldn't want to know the truth
who wants to be delusional and so

3120
00:53:46,130 --> 00:53:46,140
who wants to be delusional and so
 

3121
00:53:46,140 --> 00:53:48,650
who wants to be delusional and so
there's this tug of war because the

3122
00:53:48,650 --> 00:53:48,660
there's this tug of war because the
 

3123
00:53:48,660 --> 00:53:50,569
there's this tug of war because the
higher mind doesn't identify with ideas

3124
00:53:50,569 --> 00:53:50,579
higher mind doesn't identify with ideas
 

3125
00:53:50,579 --> 00:53:52,790
higher mind doesn't identify with ideas
why would you it's an experiment you're

3126
00:53:52,790 --> 00:53:52,800
why would you it's an experiment you're
 

3127
00:53:52,800 --> 00:53:54,290
why would you it's an experiment you're
doing it's a mental model and if someone

3128
00:53:54,290 --> 00:53:54,300
doing it's a mental model and if someone
 

3129
00:53:54,300 --> 00:53:55,790
doing it's a mental model and if someone
can come over and say you're wrong you'd

3130
00:53:55,790 --> 00:53:55,800
can come over and say you're wrong you'd
 

3131
00:53:55,800 --> 00:53:58,430
can come over and say you're wrong you'd
say where show me show me and if they

3132
00:53:58,430 --> 00:53:58,440
say where show me show me and if they
 

3133
00:53:58,440 --> 00:53:59,569
say where show me show me and if they
point out something that is wrong and

3134
00:53:59,569 --> 00:53:59,579
point out something that is wrong and
 

3135
00:53:59,579 --> 00:54:01,490
point out something that is wrong and
say oh thanks oh good I just got a

3136
00:54:01,490 --> 00:54:01,500
say oh thanks oh good I just got a
 

3137
00:54:01,500 --> 00:54:02,690
say oh thanks oh good I just got a
little smarter right you're not going to

3138
00:54:02,690 --> 00:54:02,700
little smarter right you're not going to
 

3139
00:54:02,700 --> 00:54:04,309
little smarter right you're not going to
identify with the thing go yeah kick it

3140
00:54:04,309 --> 00:54:04,319
identify with the thing go yeah kick it
 

3141
00:54:04,319 --> 00:54:05,390
identify with the thing go yeah kick it
see if you can break it if you can break

3142
00:54:05,390 --> 00:54:05,400
see if you can break it if you can break
 

3143
00:54:05,400 --> 00:54:07,670
see if you can break it if you can break
it it's not that good right so there's

3144
00:54:07,670 --> 00:54:07,680
it it's not that good right so there's
 

3145
00:54:07,680 --> 00:54:09,049
it it's not that good right so there's
both of these in our heads and there's

3146
00:54:09,049 --> 00:54:09,059
both of these in our heads and there's
 

3147
00:54:09,059 --> 00:54:11,510
both of these in our heads and there's
this tug of war between them uh and

3148
00:54:11,510 --> 00:54:11,520
this tug of war between them uh and
 

3149
00:54:11,520 --> 00:54:12,950
this tug of war between them uh and
sometimes you know if you're telling me

3150
00:54:12,950 --> 00:54:12,960
sometimes you know if you're telling me
 

3151
00:54:12,960 --> 00:54:14,329
sometimes you know if you're telling me
about something with AI I'm probably

3152
00:54:14,329 --> 00:54:14,339
about something with AI I'm probably
 

3153
00:54:14,339 --> 00:54:15,650
about something with AI I'm probably
gonna think with my higher mind because

3154
00:54:15,650 --> 00:54:15,660
gonna think with my higher mind because
 

3155
00:54:15,660 --> 00:54:17,030
gonna think with my higher mind because
I'm not identified with it but if you go

3156
00:54:17,030 --> 00:54:17,040
I'm not identified with it but if you go
 

3157
00:54:17,040 --> 00:54:18,650
I'm not identified with it but if you go
when you criticize the ideas in this

3158
00:54:18,650 --> 00:54:18,660
when you criticize the ideas in this
 

3159
00:54:18,660 --> 00:54:20,210
when you criticize the ideas in this
book or you criticize my religious

3160
00:54:20,210 --> 00:54:20,220
book or you criticize my religious
 

3161
00:54:20,220 --> 00:54:21,829
book or you criticize my religious
beliefs or your criticize I might have a

3162
00:54:21,829 --> 00:54:21,839
beliefs or your criticize I might have a
 

3163
00:54:21,839 --> 00:54:22,849
beliefs or your criticize I might have a
harder time because the Primitive mind

3164
00:54:22,849 --> 00:54:22,859
harder time because the Primitive mind
 

3165
00:54:22,859 --> 00:54:25,190
harder time because the Primitive mind
says no no those are our special ideas

3166
00:54:25,190 --> 00:54:25,200
says no no those are our special ideas
 

3167
00:54:25,200 --> 00:54:27,770
says no no those are our special ideas
and so yeah so that's that's one way to

3168
00:54:27,770 --> 00:54:27,780
and so yeah so that's that's one way to
 

3169
00:54:27,780 --> 00:54:29,809
and so yeah so that's that's one way to
use this ladder is like it's a spectrum

3170
00:54:29,809 --> 00:54:29,819
use this ladder is like it's a spectrum
 

3171
00:54:29,819 --> 00:54:31,309
use this ladder is like it's a spectrum
you know at the top the higher mind is

3172
00:54:31,309 --> 00:54:31,319
you know at the top the higher mind is
 

3173
00:54:31,319 --> 00:54:32,990
you know at the top the higher mind is
doing all the thinking and then as you

3174
00:54:32,990 --> 00:54:33,000
doing all the thinking and then as you
 

3175
00:54:33,000 --> 00:54:34,370
doing all the thinking and then as you
go down it becomes more of a tug of war

3176
00:54:34,370 --> 00:54:34,380
go down it becomes more of a tug of war
 

3177
00:54:34,380 --> 00:54:35,870
go down it becomes more of a tug of war
and at the bottom the Primitive mind is

3178
00:54:35,870 --> 00:54:35,880
and at the bottom the Primitive mind is
 

3179
00:54:35,880 --> 00:54:38,510
and at the bottom the Primitive mind is
in total control and this is distinct as

3180
00:54:38,510 --> 00:54:38,520
in total control and this is distinct as
 

3181
00:54:38,520 --> 00:54:41,089
in total control and this is distinct as
you show from the spectrum of ideas so

3182
00:54:41,089 --> 00:54:41,099
you show from the spectrum of ideas so
 

3183
00:54:41,099 --> 00:54:42,829
you show from the spectrum of ideas so
this is how you think versus what you

3184
00:54:42,829 --> 00:54:42,839
this is how you think versus what you
 

3185
00:54:42,839 --> 00:54:44,569
this is how you think versus what you
think and those are distinct those are

3186
00:54:44,569 --> 00:54:44,579
think and those are distinct those are
 

3187
00:54:44,579 --> 00:54:47,630
think and those are distinct those are
different dimensions we need we need a

3188
00:54:47,630 --> 00:54:47,640
different dimensions we need we need a
 

3189
00:54:47,640 --> 00:54:49,430
different dimensions we need we need a
vertical axis we have all these

3190
00:54:49,430 --> 00:54:49,440
vertical axis we have all these
 

3191
00:54:49,440 --> 00:54:51,530
vertical axis we have all these
horizontal axes Left Right Center or you

3192
00:54:51,530 --> 00:54:51,540
horizontal axes Left Right Center or you
 

3193
00:54:51,540 --> 00:54:52,730
horizontal axes Left Right Center or you
know you know this opinion all the way

3194
00:54:52,730 --> 00:54:52,740
know you know this opinion all the way
 

3195
00:54:52,740 --> 00:54:54,349
know you know this opinion all the way
to this opinion but it's like

3196
00:54:54,349 --> 00:54:54,359
to this opinion but it's like
 

3197
00:54:54,359 --> 00:54:56,809
to this opinion but it's like
what's much more important than where

3198
00:54:56,809 --> 00:54:56,819
what's much more important than where
 

3199
00:54:56,819 --> 00:54:58,970
what's much more important than where
you stand is how you got there right and

3200
00:54:58,970 --> 00:54:58,980
you stand is how you got there right and
 

3201
00:54:58,980 --> 00:55:02,210
you stand is how you got there right and
how you think so this helps if if I can

3202
00:55:02,210 --> 00:55:02,220
how you think so this helps if if I can
 

3203
00:55:02,220 --> 00:55:04,010
how you think so this helps if if I can
say this person's kind of on the left or

3204
00:55:04,010 --> 00:55:04,020
say this person's kind of on the left or
 

3205
00:55:04,020 --> 00:55:06,290
say this person's kind of on the left or
on the right but they're up high I think

3206
00:55:06,290 --> 00:55:06,300
on the right but they're up high I think
 

3207
00:55:06,300 --> 00:55:07,490
on the right but they're up high I think
I think in other words I think they got

3208
00:55:07,490 --> 00:55:07,500
I think in other words I think they got
 

3209
00:55:07,500 --> 00:55:09,650
I think in other words I think they got
there using evidence and reason and they

3210
00:55:09,650 --> 00:55:09,660
there using evidence and reason and they
 

3211
00:55:09,660 --> 00:55:11,030
there using evidence and reason and they
were willing to change their mind now

3212
00:55:11,030 --> 00:55:11,040
were willing to change their mind now
 

3213
00:55:11,040 --> 00:55:12,470
were willing to change their mind now
that means a lot to me what they have to

3214
00:55:12,470 --> 00:55:12,480
that means a lot to me what they have to
 

3215
00:55:12,480 --> 00:55:14,450
that means a lot to me what they have to
say if I think they're just a tribal

3216
00:55:14,450 --> 00:55:14,460
say if I think they're just a tribal
 

3217
00:55:14,460 --> 00:55:15,650
say if I think they're just a tribal
person and I can predict all their

3218
00:55:15,650 --> 00:55:15,660
person and I can predict all their
 

3219
00:55:15,660 --> 00:55:17,150
person and I can predict all their
beliefs from hearing one because it's so

3220
00:55:17,150 --> 00:55:17,160
beliefs from hearing one because it's so
 

3221
00:55:17,160 --> 00:55:18,770
beliefs from hearing one because it's so
obvious what political beliefs that

3222
00:55:18,770 --> 00:55:18,780
obvious what political beliefs that
 

3223
00:55:18,780 --> 00:55:20,450
obvious what political beliefs that
person's views are irrelevant to me

3224
00:55:20,450 --> 00:55:20,460
person's views are irrelevant to me
 

3225
00:55:20,460 --> 00:55:22,010
person's views are irrelevant to me
because they're not real they didn't

3226
00:55:22,010 --> 00:55:22,020
because they're not real they didn't
 

3227
00:55:22,020 --> 00:55:25,730
because they're not real they didn't
come from information they came from a

3228
00:55:25,730 --> 00:55:25,740
come from information they came from a
 

3229
00:55:25,740 --> 00:55:28,430
come from information they came from a
tribe's kind of you know sacred Ten

the best boxer in the world I can just

3242
00:55:42,710 --> 00:55:42,720
the best boxer in the world I can just
 

3243
00:55:42,720 --> 00:55:44,750
the best boxer in the world I can just
tell now I mean this connects with me

3244
00:55:44,750 --> 00:55:44,760
tell now I mean this connects with me
 

3245

tell now I mean this connects with me
and I think with a lot of people just

3246
00:55:46,069 --> 00:55:46,079
and I think with a lot of people just
 

3247
00:55:46,079 --> 00:55:47,690
and I think with a lot of people just
because in martial arts it's especially

3248
00:55:47,690 --> 00:55:47,700
because in martial arts it's especially
 

3249
00:55:47,700 --> 00:55:49,730
because in martial arts it's especially
kind of true that this is this whole

3250
00:55:49,730 --> 00:55:49,740
kind of true that this is this whole
 

3251
00:55:49,740 --> 00:55:51,290
kind of true that this is this whole
legend about different martial artists

3252
00:55:51,290 --> 00:55:51,300
legend about different martial artists
 

3253
00:55:51,300 --> 00:55:54,770
legend about different martial artists
and that kind of would construct like

3254
00:55:54,770 --> 00:55:54,780
and that kind of would construct like
 

3255
00:55:54,780 --> 00:55:58,010
and that kind of would construct like
action figures like you know thinking

3256
00:55:58,010 --> 00:55:58,020
action figures like you know thinking
 

3257
00:55:58,020 --> 00:56:00,049
action figures like you know thinking
that uh Steven Seagal is the best

3258
00:56:00,049 --> 00:56:00,059
that uh Steven Seagal is the best
 

3259
00:56:00,059 --> 00:56:02,089
that uh Steven Seagal is the best
fighter in the world or Chuck Norris But

3260
00:56:02,089 --> 00:56:02,099
fighter in the world or Chuck Norris But
 

3261
00:56:02,099 --> 00:56:03,650
fighter in the world or Chuck Norris But

map this onto ideas that people take
personally it starts becoming a lot more

3308
00:56:51,890 --> 00:56:51,900
personally it starts becoming a lot more
 

3309
00:56:51,900 --> 00:56:54,049
personally it starts becoming a lot more
difficult to um

3310
00:56:54,049 --> 00:56:54,059
difficult to um
 

3311
00:56:54,059 --> 00:56:55,609
difficult to um
to basically highlight that we're

3312
00:56:55,609 --> 00:56:55,619
to basically highlight that we're
 

3313
00:56:55,619 --> 00:56:58,250
to basically highlight that we're
thinking with uh not with our higher

thinking with uh not with our higher
 

3315
00:56:58,260 --> 00:57:00,230
thinking with uh not with our higher
mind but without primitive mind

01:00:37,130 --> 01:00:37,140
theories under this framework of the
 

3535
01:00:37,140 --> 01:00:38,750
theories under this framework of the
latter so

3536
01:00:38,750 --> 01:00:38,760
latter so
 

3537
01:00:38,760 --> 01:00:40,130

01:00:40,140 --> 01:00:41,630
here's the thing about conspiracy
theories is that

3540
01:00:41,630 --> 01:00:41,640
theories is that
 

3541

theories is that
once in a while they're true right so

3542
01:00:43,789 --> 01:00:43,799
once in a while they're true right so
 

3543
01:00:43,799 --> 01:00:44,870
once in a while they're true right so
because sometimes there's a natural

01:00:44,870 --> 01:00:44,880
because sometimes there's a natural
 

3545
01:00:44,880 --> 01:00:46,430
because sometimes there's a natural
conspiracy actually humans are pretty

3546
01:00:46,430 --> 01:00:46,440

um and
um so the question is

3558
01:00:59,930 --> 01:00:59,940
um so the question is
 

3559
01:00:59,940 --> 01:01:03,849
um so the question is
how do you create a system that is good

3560
01:01:03,849 --> 01:01:03,859
how do you create a system that is good
 

3561
01:01:03,859 --> 01:01:08,150
how do you create a system that is good
at you put the conspiracy theory in and

3562
01:01:08,150 --> 01:01:08,160
at you put the conspiracy theory in and
 

3563
01:01:08,160 --> 01:01:10,730
at you put the conspiracy theory in and
it either goes e or it says this is

3564
01:01:10,730 --> 01:01:10,740
it either goes e or it says this is
 

3565
01:01:10,740 --> 01:01:12,109
it either goes e or it says this is
interesting let's keep exploring it like

3566
01:01:12,109 --> 01:01:12,119
interesting let's keep exploring it like
 

3567
01:01:12,119 --> 01:01:13,130
interesting let's keep exploring it like
how do you put how do you do something

3568
01:01:13,130 --> 01:01:13,140
how do you put how do you do something
 

3569
01:01:13,140 --> 01:01:14,329
how do you put how do you do something
that it can how do you assess and so

3570
01:01:14,329 --> 01:01:14,339
that it can how do you assess and so
 

3571
01:01:14,339 --> 01:01:17,450
that it can how do you assess and so
again I think the hiron culture

3572
01:01:17,450 --> 01:01:17,460
again I think the hiron culture
 

3573
01:01:17,460 --> 01:01:20,390
again I think the hiron culture
is really good at it because a real

3574
01:01:20,390 --> 01:01:20,400
is really good at it because a real
 

3575
01:01:20,400 --> 01:01:21,890
is really good at it because a real
conspiracy you're what's going to happen

3576
01:01:21,890 --> 01:01:21,900
conspiracy you're what's going to happen
 

3577
01:01:21,900 --> 01:01:24,049
conspiracy you're what's going to happen
is you put it it's like a little machine

3578
01:01:24,049 --> 01:01:24,059
is you put it it's like a little machine
 

3579
01:01:24,059 --> 01:01:25,190
is you put it it's like a little machine
you put in the middle of the table and

3580
01:01:25,190 --> 01:01:25,200
you put in the middle of the table and
 

3581
01:01:25,200 --> 01:01:26,870
you put in the middle of the table and
everyone starts firing darts at it or

3582
01:01:26,870 --> 01:01:26,880
everyone starts firing darts at it or
 

3583
01:01:26,880 --> 01:01:27,950
everyone starts firing darts at it or
bow and arrow or whatever and everyone

3584
01:01:27,950 --> 01:01:27,960
bow and arrow or whatever and everyone
 

3585
01:01:27,960 --> 01:01:30,170
bow and arrow or whatever and everyone
starts kicking it and trying to and

3586
01:01:30,170 --> 01:01:30,180
starts kicking it and trying to and
 

3587
01:01:30,180 --> 01:01:32,210
starts kicking it and trying to and
almost all conspiracy theories they

3588
01:01:32,210 --> 01:01:32,220
almost all conspiracy theories they
 

3589
01:01:32,220 --> 01:01:34,010
almost all conspiracy theories they
quickly crumble right because they

3590
01:01:34,010 --> 01:01:34,020
quickly crumble right because they
 

3591
01:01:34,020 --> 01:01:35,870
quickly crumble right because they
actually you know you know Trump's

3592
01:01:35,870 --> 01:01:35,880
actually you know you know Trump's
 

3593
01:01:35,880 --> 01:01:37,849
actually you know you know Trump's
election one is and I actually dug in

3594
01:01:37,849 --> 01:01:37,859
election one is and I actually dug in
 

3595
01:01:37,859 --> 01:01:39,770
election one is and I actually dug in
and I looked at like every claim that he

3596
01:01:39,770 --> 01:01:39,780
and I looked at like every claim that he
 

3597
01:01:39,780 --> 01:01:42,049
and I looked at like every claim that he
or his team made and I was like

3598
01:01:42,049 --> 01:01:42,059
or his team made and I was like
 

3599
01:01:42,059 --> 01:01:44,150
or his team made and I was like
all of these none of these hold up to

3600
01:01:44,150 --> 01:01:44,160
all of these none of these hold up to
 

3601
01:01:44,160 --> 01:01:45,589
all of these none of these hold up to
scrutiny none of them I was open-minded

3602
01:01:45,589 --> 01:01:45,599
scrutiny none of them I was open-minded
 

3603
01:01:45,599 --> 01:01:47,390
scrutiny none of them I was open-minded
but none of them did so that was one

3604
01:01:47,390 --> 01:01:47,400
but none of them did so that was one
 

3605
01:01:47,400 --> 01:01:49,789
but none of them did so that was one
that as soon as it's open to scrutiny it

3606
01:01:49,789 --> 01:01:49,799
that as soon as it's open to scrutiny it
 

3607
01:01:49,799 --> 01:01:51,109
that as soon as it's open to scrutiny it
crumbles

3608
01:01:51,109 --> 01:01:51,119
crumbles
 

3609
01:01:51,119 --> 01:01:53,870
crumbles
the only way that conspiracy can stick

3610
01:01:53,870 --> 01:01:53,880
the only way that conspiracy can stick
 

3611
01:01:53,880 --> 01:01:56,990
the only way that conspiracy can stick
around in a community is if

3612
01:01:56,990 --> 01:01:57,000
around in a community is if
 

3613
01:01:57,000 --> 01:01:58,670
around in a community is if
it is a culture where that's being

3614
01:01:58,670 --> 01:01:58,680
it is a culture where that's being
 

3615
01:01:58,680 --> 01:02:00,650
it is a culture where that's being
treated as a sacred idea that no one

3616
01:02:00,650 --> 01:02:00,660
treated as a sacred idea that no one
 

3617
01:02:00,660 --> 01:02:02,390
treated as a sacred idea that no one
should kick or throw a dart at because

3618
01:02:02,390 --> 01:02:02,400
should kick or throw a dart at because
 

3619
01:02:02,400 --> 01:02:03,410
should kick or throw a dart at because
if we throw a dart it's going to break

3620
01:02:03,410 --> 01:02:03,420
if we throw a dart it's going to break
 

3621
01:02:03,420 --> 01:02:06,829
if we throw a dart it's going to break
so it's being it's and so the what you

3622
01:02:06,829 --> 01:02:06,839
so it's being it's and so the what you
 

3623
01:02:06,839 --> 01:02:08,870
so it's being it's and so the what you
want is this is a culture where no idea

3624
01:02:08,870 --> 01:02:08,880
want is this is a culture where no idea
 

3625
01:02:08,880 --> 01:02:10,849
want is this is a culture where no idea
is sacred anything can get thrown out

3626
01:02:10,849 --> 01:02:10,859
is sacred anything can get thrown out
 

3627
01:02:10,859 --> 01:02:12,650
is sacred anything can get thrown out
and so I think that then what you'll

3628
01:02:12,650 --> 01:02:12,660
and so I think that then what you'll
 

3629
01:02:12,660 --> 01:02:15,770
and so I think that then what you'll
find is that 994 out of 100 conspiracy

3630
01:02:15,770 --> 01:02:15,780
find is that 994 out of 100 conspiracy
 

3631
01:02:15,780 --> 01:02:17,750
find is that 994 out of 100 conspiracy
theories come in and they fall down the

3632
01:02:17,750 --> 01:02:17,760
theories come in and they fall down the
 

3633
01:02:17,760 --> 01:02:19,789
theories come in and they fall down the
other maybe four of the others come in

3634
01:02:19,789 --> 01:02:19,799
other maybe four of the others come in
 

3635
01:02:19,799 --> 01:02:21,230
other maybe four of the others come in
and there's something there but it's not

3636
01:02:21,230 --> 01:02:21,240
and there's something there but it's not
 

3637
01:02:21,240 --> 01:02:22,549
and there's something there but it's not
as Extreme as people say and then maybe

3638
01:02:22,549 --> 01:02:22,559
as Extreme as people say and then maybe
 

3639
01:02:22,559 --> 01:02:24,710
as Extreme as people say and then maybe
one is a huge deal and it's actually a

3640
01:02:24,710 --> 01:02:24,720
one is a huge deal and it's actually a
 

3641
01:02:24,720 --> 01:02:26,750
one is a huge deal and it's actually a
real conspiracy well isn't there a lot

3642
01:02:26,750 --> 01:02:26,760
real conspiracy well isn't there a lot
 

3643
01:02:26,760 --> 01:02:28,309
real conspiracy well isn't there a lot
of gray area and there's a lot of

3644
01:02:28,309 --> 01:02:28,319
of gray area and there's a lot of
 

3645
01:02:28,319 --> 01:02:31,250
of gray area and there's a lot of
mystery isn't that where the conspiracy

3646
01:02:31,250 --> 01:02:31,260
mystery isn't that where the conspiracy
 

3647
01:02:31,260 --> 01:02:34,609
mystery isn't that where the conspiracy
theories seep in so uh it's great to

3648
01:02:34,609 --> 01:02:34,619
theories seep in so uh it's great to
 

3649
01:02:34,619 --> 01:02:36,470
theories seep in so uh it's great to
hear that you've really looked into the

3650
01:02:36,470 --> 01:02:36,480
hear that you've really looked into the
 

3651
01:02:36,480 --> 01:02:39,230
hear that you've really looked into the
the the Trump election fraud claims

3652
01:02:39,230 --> 01:02:39,240
the the Trump election fraud claims
 

3653
01:02:39,240 --> 01:02:42,230
the the Trump election fraud claims
but aren't they resting on a lot of kind

3654
01:02:42,230 --> 01:02:42,240
but aren't they resting on a lot of kind
 

3655
01:02:42,240 --> 01:02:45,950
but aren't they resting on a lot of kind
of gray area like fog basically saying

3656
01:02:45,950 --> 01:02:45,960
of gray area like fog basically saying
 

3657
01:02:45,960 --> 01:02:48,410
of gray area like fog basically saying
that there is dark Forces in the shadows

3658
01:02:48,410 --> 01:02:48,420
that there is dark Forces in the shadows
 

3659
01:02:48,420 --> 01:02:49,670
that there is dark Forces in the shadows
that are actually controlling everything

3660
01:02:49,670 --> 01:02:49,680
that are actually controlling everything
 

3661
01:02:49,680 --> 01:02:51,829
that are actually controlling everything
I mean the same thing with uh maybe we

3662
01:02:51,829 --> 01:02:51,839
I mean the same thing with uh maybe we
 

3663
01:02:51,839 --> 01:02:55,010
I mean the same thing with uh maybe we
can there's like safer conspiracy

3664
01:02:55,010 --> 01:02:55,020
can there's like safer conspiracy
 

3665
01:02:55,020 --> 01:02:56,750
can there's like safer conspiracy
theories more less controversial ones

3666
01:02:56,750 --> 01:02:56,760
theories more less controversial ones
 

3667
01:02:56,760 --> 01:02:59,230
theories more less controversial ones
like have we landed on the moon right

3668
01:02:59,230 --> 01:02:59,240
like have we landed on the moon right
 

3669
01:02:59,240 --> 01:03:02,390
like have we landed on the moon right
the United States ever land on the Moon

3670
01:03:02,390 --> 01:03:02,400
the United States ever land on the Moon
 

3671
01:03:02,400 --> 01:03:05,030
the United States ever land on the Moon
there's you know you like the reason

3672
01:03:05,030 --> 01:03:05,040
there's you know you like the reason
 

3673
01:03:05,040 --> 01:03:07,069
there's you know you like the reason
those conspiracy theories work is you

3674
01:03:07,069 --> 01:03:07,079
those conspiracy theories work is you
 

3675
01:03:07,079 --> 01:03:09,710
those conspiracy theories work is you
could construct there's incentives and

3676
01:03:09,710 --> 01:03:09,720
could construct there's incentives and
 

3677
01:03:09,720 --> 01:03:11,390
could construct there's incentives and
motivation for faking the moon landing

3678
01:03:11,390 --> 01:03:11,400
motivation for faking the moon landing
 

3679
01:03:11,400 --> 01:03:14,930
motivation for faking the moon landing
there's a lot of

3680
01:03:14,930 --> 01:03:14,940

 

3681
01:03:14,940 --> 01:03:17,349

um there's a there's very little data

3682
01:03:17,349 --> 01:03:17,359
um there's a there's very little data
 

3683
01:03:17,359 --> 01:03:20,630
um there's a there's very little data
supporting the moon landing like that's

3684
01:03:20,630 --> 01:03:20,640
supporting the moon landing like that's
 

3685
01:03:20,640 --> 01:03:22,609
supporting the moon landing like that's
very public and kind of looks fake space

3686
01:03:22,609 --> 01:03:22,619
very public and kind of looks fake space
 

3687
01:03:22,619 --> 01:03:24,349
very public and kind of looks fake space
and that would be a big story if it

3688
01:03:24,349 --> 01:03:24,359
and that would be a big story if it
 

3689
01:03:24,359 --> 01:03:26,630
and that would be a big story if it
turned out to be fake that's the art

3690
01:03:26,630 --> 01:03:26,640
turned out to be fake that's the art
 

3691
01:03:26,640 --> 01:03:27,589
turned out to be fake that's the art
that's that would be the argument

3692
01:03:27,589 --> 01:03:27,599
that's that would be the argument
 

3693
01:03:27,599 --> 01:03:30,349
that's that would be the argument
against it like our people really as a

3694
01:03:30,349 --> 01:03:30,359
against it like our people really as a
 

3695
01:03:30,359 --> 01:03:32,390
against it like our people really as a
collective going to hold on to a story

3696
01:03:32,390 --> 01:03:32,400
collective going to hold on to a story
 

3697
01:03:32,400 --> 01:03:34,670
collective going to hold on to a story
that big

3698
01:03:34,670 --> 01:03:34,680
that big
 

3699
01:03:34,680 --> 01:03:36,710
that big
um yeah so that but but there's a lot

3700
01:03:36,710 --> 01:03:36,720
um yeah so that but but there's a lot
 

3701
01:03:36,720 --> 01:03:38,329
um yeah so that but but there's a lot
that the reason they work is there's

3702
01:03:38,329 --> 01:03:38,339
that the reason they work is there's
 

3703
01:03:38,339 --> 01:03:40,069
that the reason they work is there's
mystery yeah it's a great documentary

3704
01:03:40,069 --> 01:03:40,079
mystery yeah it's a great documentary
 

3705
01:03:40,079 --> 01:03:42,170
mystery yeah it's a great documentary

conspiracy and they believe it and so
it's so interesting is that

3726
01:04:02,030 --> 01:04:02,040
it's so interesting is that
 

3727
01:04:02,040 --> 01:04:04,430
it's so interesting is that
I think of it as a um

3728
01:04:04,430 --> 01:04:04,440
I think of it as a um
 

3729
01:04:04,440 --> 01:04:08,089
I think of it as a um
as a skepticism Spectrum yeah so on one

3730
01:04:08,089 --> 01:04:08,099
as a skepticism Spectrum yeah so on one
 

3731
01:04:08,099 --> 01:04:10,609
as a skepticism Spectrum yeah so on one
side you it's like a filter in your head

3732
01:04:10,609 --> 01:04:10,619
side you it's like a filter in your head
 

3733
01:04:10,619 --> 01:04:13,190
side you it's like a filter in your head
a filter in your in the beliefs section

3734
01:04:13,190 --> 01:04:13,200
a filter in your in the beliefs section
 

3735
01:04:13,200 --> 01:04:15,230
a filter in your in the beliefs section
of your brain on one end of the spectrum

3736
01:04:15,230 --> 01:04:15,240
of your brain on one end of the spectrum
 

3737
01:04:15,240 --> 01:04:18,230
of your brain on one end of the spectrum
you are gullible perfectly gullible you

3738
01:04:18,230 --> 01:04:18,240
you are gullible perfectly gullible you
 

3739
01:04:18,240 --> 01:04:19,609
you are gullible perfectly gullible you
believe anything someone says right on

3740
01:04:19,609 --> 01:04:19,619
believe anything someone says right on
 

3741
01:04:19,619 --> 01:04:20,809
believe anything someone says right on
the other side you're paranoid you think

3742
01:04:20,809 --> 01:04:20,819
the other side you're paranoid you think
 

3743
01:04:20,819 --> 01:04:21,890
the other side you're paranoid you think
everyone's lying to you right

3744
01:04:21,890 --> 01:04:21,900
everyone's lying to you right
 

3745
01:04:21,900 --> 01:04:23,690
everyone's lying to you right
everything's everything is false nothing

3746
01:04:23,690 --> 01:04:23,700
everything's everything is false nothing
 

3747
01:04:23,700 --> 01:04:25,430
everything's everything is false nothing
that anyone says is true right so

3748
01:04:25,430 --> 01:04:25,440
that anyone says is true right so
 

3749
01:04:25,440 --> 01:04:27,530
that anyone says is true right so
obviously those aren't good places to be

3750
01:04:27,530 --> 01:04:27,540
obviously those aren't good places to be
 

3751
01:04:27,540 --> 01:04:29,390
obviously those aren't good places to be
um now the healthy place I think that

3752
01:04:29,390 --> 01:04:29,400
um now the healthy place I think that
 

3753
01:04:29,400 --> 01:04:31,910
um now the healthy place I think that
that the so so I think the healthy place

3754
01:04:31,910 --> 01:04:31,920
that the so so I think the healthy place
 

3755
01:04:31,920 --> 01:04:33,650
that the so so I think the healthy place
is to be somewhere in the middle and but

3756
01:04:33,650 --> 01:04:33,660
is to be somewhere in the middle and but
 

3757
01:04:33,660 --> 01:04:34,970
is to be somewhere in the middle and but
also you can learn to trust certain

3758
01:04:34,970 --> 01:04:34,980
also you can learn to trust certain
 

3759
01:04:34,980 --> 01:04:36,349
also you can learn to trust certain
sources and then you know you don't have

3760
01:04:36,349 --> 01:04:36,359
sources and then you know you don't have
 

3761
01:04:36,359 --> 01:04:38,030
sources and then you know you don't have
to do as much apply as much skepticism

3762
01:04:38,030 --> 01:04:38,040
to do as much apply as much skepticism
 

3763
01:04:38,040 --> 01:04:41,569
to do as much apply as much skepticism
to them and so here's what

3764
01:04:41,569 --> 01:04:41,579
to them and so here's what
 

3765
01:04:41,579 --> 01:04:44,270
to them and so here's what
like and when you start having a bias

3766
01:04:44,270 --> 01:04:44,280
like and when you start having a bias
 

3767
01:04:44,280 --> 01:04:46,250
like and when you start having a bias
just so you have a political bias

3768
01:04:46,250 --> 01:04:46,260
just so you have a political bias
 

3769
01:04:46,260 --> 01:04:48,349
just so you have a political bias
when your side says something you you

3770
01:04:48,349 --> 01:04:48,359
when your side says something you you
 

3771
01:04:48,359 --> 01:04:49,789
when your side says something you you
will find yourself moving towards the

3772
01:04:49,789 --> 01:04:49,799
will find yourself moving towards the
 

3773
01:04:49,799 --> 01:04:51,289
will find yourself moving towards the
gullible side of the spectrum you read

3774
01:04:51,289 --> 01:04:51,299
gullible side of the spectrum you read
 

3775
01:04:51,299 --> 01:04:53,210
gullible side of the spectrum you read
an article written that's that supports

3776
01:04:53,210 --> 01:04:53,220
an article written that's that supports
 

3777
01:04:53,220 --> 01:04:54,530
an article written that's that supports
your views you move to the gullible side

3778
01:04:54,530 --> 01:04:54,540
your views you move to the gullible side
 

3779
01:04:54,540 --> 01:04:55,730
your views you move to the gullible side
of the spectrum and you just believe it

3780
01:04:55,730 --> 01:04:55,740
of the spectrum and you just believe it
 

3781
01:04:55,740 --> 01:04:56,750
of the spectrum and you just believe it
and you don't have any where's that

3782
01:04:56,750 --> 01:04:56,760
and you don't have any where's that
 

3783
01:04:56,760 --> 01:04:58,250
and you don't have any where's that
skepticism that you normally have right

3784
01:04:58,250 --> 01:04:58,260
skepticism that you normally have right
 

3785
01:04:58,260 --> 01:04:59,930
skepticism that you normally have right
and then you move and then you soon as

3786
01:04:59,930 --> 01:04:59,940
and then you move and then you soon as
 

3787
01:04:59,940 --> 01:05:01,010
and then you move and then you soon as
soon as it's the other person talking

3788
01:05:01,010 --> 01:05:01,020
soon as it's the other person talking
 

3789
01:05:01,020 --> 01:05:02,569
soon as it's the other person talking
the other team talking you move to the

3790
01:05:02,569 --> 01:05:02,579
the other team talking you move to the
 

3791
01:05:02,579 --> 01:05:04,910
the other team talking you move to the
skeptical the the closer to the to the

3792
01:05:04,910 --> 01:05:04,920
skeptical the the closer to the to the
 

3793
01:05:04,920 --> 01:05:07,730
skeptical the the closer to the to the
you know denial paranoid side now

3794
01:05:07,730 --> 01:05:07,740
you know denial paranoid side now
 

3795
01:05:07,740 --> 01:05:10,250
you know denial paranoid side now
flat earthers are the extreme they are

3796
01:05:10,250 --> 01:05:10,260
flat earthers are the extreme they are
 

3797
01:05:10,260 --> 01:05:12,890
flat earthers are the extreme they are
either at 10 or 1.

3798
01:05:12,890 --> 01:05:12,900
either at 10 or 1.
 

3799
01:05:12,900 --> 01:05:14,329
either at 10 or 1.
so it's like it's so interesting because

3800
01:05:14,329 --> 01:05:14,339
so it's like it's so interesting because
 

3801
01:05:14,339 --> 01:05:16,010
so it's like it's so interesting because
they're the people who are saying ah nah

3802
01:05:16,010 --> 01:05:16,020
they're the people who are saying ah nah
 

3803
01:05:16,020 --> 01:05:17,569
they're the people who are saying ah nah
I won't believe you I'm not gullible no

3804
01:05:17,569 --> 01:05:17,579
I won't believe you I'm not gullible no
 

3805
01:05:17,579 --> 01:05:19,010
I won't believe you I'm not gullible no
everyone else is gullible about the moon

3806
01:05:19,010 --> 01:05:19,020
everyone else is gullible about the moon
 

3807
01:05:19,020 --> 01:05:20,809
everyone else is gullible about the moon
landing I won't and then yet when

3808
01:05:20,809 --> 01:05:20,819
landing I won't and then yet when
 

3809
01:05:20,819 --> 01:05:22,609
landing I won't and then yet when
there's this evidence like oh because

3810
01:05:22,609 --> 01:05:22,619
there's this evidence like oh because
 

3811
01:05:22,619 --> 01:05:24,710
there's this evidence like oh because
you can't see Seattle you can't see the

3812
01:05:24,710 --> 01:05:24,720
you can't see Seattle you can't see the
 

3813
01:05:24,720 --> 01:05:26,690
you can't see Seattle you can't see the
buildings over that Horizon and you

3814
01:05:26,690 --> 01:05:26,700
buildings over that Horizon and you
 

3815
01:05:26,700 --> 01:05:28,670
buildings over that Horizon and you
should which isn't true you should be if

3816
01:05:28,670 --> 01:05:28,680
should which isn't true you should be if
 

3817
01:05:28,680 --> 01:05:29,870
should which isn't true you should be if
it were or if the Earth around you

3818
01:05:29,870 --> 01:05:29,880
it were or if the Earth around you
 

3819
01:05:29,880 --> 01:05:32,150
it were or if the Earth around you
wouldn't be able to see them therefore

3820
01:05:32,150 --> 01:05:32,160
wouldn't be able to see them therefore
 

3821
01:05:32,160 --> 01:05:33,410
wouldn't be able to see them therefore
it's so suddenly they become the most

3822
01:05:33,410 --> 01:05:33,420
it's so suddenly they become the most
 

3823
01:05:33,420 --> 01:05:34,849
it's so suddenly they become the most
gullible person here any theory about

3824
01:05:34,849 --> 01:05:34,859
gullible person here any theory about
 

3825
01:05:34,859 --> 01:05:36,410
gullible person here any theory about
the earth flat they believe it it goes

3826
01:05:36,410 --> 01:05:36,420
the earth flat they believe it it goes
 

3827
01:05:36,420 --> 01:05:37,849
the earth flat they believe it it goes
right into their beliefs so they're

3828
01:05:37,849 --> 01:05:37,859
right into their beliefs so they're
 

3829
01:05:37,859 --> 01:05:39,410
right into their beliefs so they're
actually jumping back and forth between

3830
01:05:39,410 --> 01:05:39,420
actually jumping back and forth between
 

3831
01:05:39,420 --> 01:05:41,809
actually jumping back and forth between
refuses to believe anything and believe

3832
01:05:41,809 --> 01:05:41,819
refuses to believe anything and believe
 

3833
01:05:41,819 --> 01:05:43,430
refuses to believe anything and believe
anything and so they're the extreme

3834
01:05:43,430 --> 01:05:43,440
anything and so they're the extreme
 

3835
01:05:43,440 --> 01:05:45,109
anything and so they're the extreme
example but I think when it comes to

3836
01:05:45,109 --> 01:05:45,119
example but I think when it comes to
 

3837
01:05:45,119 --> 01:05:46,670
example but I think when it comes to
conspiracy theories the people that get

3838
01:05:46,670 --> 01:05:46,680
conspiracy theories the people that get
 

3839
01:05:46,680 --> 01:05:47,930
conspiracy theories the people that get
themselves into trouble

3840
01:05:47,930 --> 01:05:47,940
themselves into trouble
 

3841
01:05:47,940 --> 01:05:50,329
themselves into trouble
are the ones who they they become really

3842
01:05:50,329 --> 01:05:50,339
are the ones who they they become really
 

3843
01:05:50,339 --> 01:05:51,829
are the ones who they they become really
gullible when they hear a conspiracy

3844
01:05:51,829 --> 01:05:51,839
gullible when they hear a conspiracy
 

3845
01:05:51,839 --> 01:05:52,789
gullible when they hear a conspiracy
theory that kind of fits with their

3846
01:05:52,789 --> 01:05:52,799
theory that kind of fits with their
 

3847
01:05:52,799 --> 01:05:55,190
theory that kind of fits with their
world view and they likewise when

3848
01:05:55,190 --> 01:05:55,200
world view and they likewise when
 

3849
01:05:55,200 --> 01:05:56,089
world view and they likewise when
there's something that's kind of

3850
01:05:56,089 --> 01:05:56,099
there's something that's kind of
 

3851
01:05:56,099 --> 01:05:57,950
there's something that's kind of
obviously true and it's not a big lie

3852
01:05:57,950 --> 01:05:57,960
obviously true and it's not a big lie
 

3853
01:05:57,960 --> 01:06:01,010
obviously true and it's not a big lie
they will actually uh they'll they'll

3854
01:06:01,010 --> 01:06:01,020
they will actually uh they'll they'll
 

3855
01:06:01,020 --> 01:06:02,510
they will actually uh they'll they'll
think it is they they just tighten up

3856
01:06:02,510 --> 01:06:02,520
think it is they they just tighten up
 

3857
01:06:02,520 --> 01:06:04,730
think it is they they just tighten up
their kind of skepticism filter and and

3858
01:06:04,730 --> 01:06:04,740
their kind of skepticism filter and and
 

3859
01:06:04,740 --> 01:06:07,069
their kind of skepticism filter and and
so yeah so I I think the healthy places

3860
01:06:07,069 --> 01:06:07,079
so yeah so I I think the healthy places
 

3861
01:06:07,079 --> 01:06:09,170
so yeah so I I think the healthy places
to be is where you are not because you

3862
01:06:09,170 --> 01:06:09,180
to be is where you are not because you
 

3863
01:06:09,180 --> 01:06:10,130
to be is where you are not because you
also don't want to be the person who

3864
01:06:10,130 --> 01:06:10,140
also don't want to be the person who
 

3865
01:06:10,140 --> 01:06:11,450
also don't want to be the person who
says every conspiracy you hear the word

3866
01:06:11,450 --> 01:06:11,460
says every conspiracy you hear the word
 

3867
01:06:11,460 --> 01:06:13,130
says every conspiracy you hear the word
conspiracy theory and it sounds like a

3868
01:06:13,130 --> 01:06:13,140
conspiracy theory and it sounds like a
 

3869
01:06:13,140 --> 01:06:16,910
conspiracy theory and it sounds like a
like a synonym for like quack job crazy

3870
01:06:16,910 --> 01:06:16,920
like a synonym for like quack job crazy
 

3871
01:06:16,920 --> 01:06:20,210
like a synonym for like quack job crazy
Theory right so yeah so I I think yeah I

3872
01:06:20,210 --> 01:06:20,220
Theory right so yeah so I I think yeah I
 

3873
01:06:20,220 --> 01:06:21,589
Theory right so yeah so I I think yeah I
think it's be somewhere in the middle of

3874
01:06:21,589 --> 01:06:21,599
think it's be somewhere in the middle of
 

3875
01:06:21,599 --> 01:06:23,450
think it's be somewhere in the middle of
that spectrum and to learn to fine tune

3876
01:06:23,450 --> 01:06:23,460
that spectrum and to learn to fine tune
 

3877
01:06:23,460 --> 01:06:25,190
that spectrum and to learn to fine tune
it which is a tricky place to operate

3878
01:06:25,190 --> 01:06:25,200
it which is a tricky place to operate
 

3879
01:06:25,200 --> 01:06:26,809
it which is a tricky place to operate
because you kind of have to every time

3880
01:06:26,809 --> 01:06:26,819
because you kind of have to every time
 

3881
01:06:26,819 --> 01:06:29,210
because you kind of have to every time
you hear a new conspiracy theory you

3882
01:06:29,210 --> 01:06:29,220
you hear a new conspiracy theory you
 

3883
01:06:29,220 --> 01:06:31,309
you hear a new conspiracy theory you
should approach it with an open mind

3884
01:06:31,309 --> 01:06:31,319
should approach it with an open mind
 

3885
01:06:31,319 --> 01:06:34,250
should approach it with an open mind
and you know and also if you don't have

01:06:34,250 --> 01:06:34,260
and you know and also if you don't have
 

3887
01:06:34,260 --> 01:06:35,930
and you know and also if you don't have
enough time to investigate which most

3888
01:06:35,930 --> 01:06:35,940
enough time to investigate which most
 

3889
01:06:35,940 --> 01:06:37,730
enough time to investigate which most
people don't kind of still have a

people don't kind of still have a
 

3891
01:06:37,740 --> 01:06:39,829
people don't kind of still have a
humility not to make a conclusive

3892
01:06:39,829 --> 01:06:39,839
humility not to make a conclusive
 

3893
01:06:39,839 --> 01:06:41,930
humility not to make a conclusive
statement that that's nonsense there's a

3894

01:07:00,599 --> 01:07:05,150
it's like uh turned out that that was at

01:07:53,039 --> 01:07:54,890
right you can see the social pressure
and that's and of course when there is a

3966
01:07:54,890 --> 01:07:54,900
and that's and of course when there is a
 

3967
01:07:54,900 --> 01:07:56,870
and that's and of course when there is a
conspiracy that social pressure is its

3968
01:07:56,870 --> 01:07:56,880
conspiracy that social pressure is its
 

3969

best friend
 

3971
01:07:58,160 --> 01:08:02,089
best friend

because then they see the people from
 

3973
01:08:02,099 --> 01:08:04,730

so it was a sad moment because it was a
 

4151
01:11:05,580 --> 01:11:07,370
so it was a sad moment because it was a
couple months at the very even a week or

4152
01:11:07,370 --> 01:11:07,380
couple months at the very even a week or

4155
01:11:09,000 --> 01:11:10,490
so the I mean a month or so at the very
beginning when

4156
01:11:10,490 --> 01:11:10,500
beginning when
 

4157
01:11:10,500 --> 01:11:11,870
beginning when
it felt like a lot of our other

4158
01:11:11,870 --> 01:11:11,880
it felt like a lot of our other
 

4159
01:11:11,880 --> 01:11:13,729
it felt like a lot of our other
squabbles were kind of like oh I feel

4160
01:11:13,729 --> 01:11:13,739
squabbles were kind of like oh I feel
 

4161
01:11:13,739 --> 01:11:14,810
squabbles were kind of like oh I feel
like they're kind of irrelevant right

4162
01:11:14,810 --> 01:11:14,820
like they're kind of irrelevant right
 

4163
01:11:14,820 --> 01:11:16,729
like they're kind of irrelevant right
now yeah and then very quickly the

4164
01:11:16,729 --> 01:11:16,739
now yeah and then very quickly the
 

4165
01:11:16,739 --> 01:11:18,950
now yeah and then very quickly the
whirlpool sucked it in and and

4166
01:11:18,950 --> 01:11:18,960
whirlpool sucked it in and and
 

4167
01:11:18,960 --> 01:11:21,050
whirlpool sucked it in and and
in a way where I think it damaged the

4168
01:11:21,050 --> 01:11:21,060
in a way where I think it damaged the
 

4169
01:11:21,060 --> 01:11:22,550
in a way where I think it damaged the
reputation of these a lot of the the

4170
01:11:22,550 --> 01:11:22,560
reputation of these a lot of the the

01:11:25,970 --> 01:11:25,980
the long run but there's also an
 

4175
01:11:25,980 --> 01:11:28,010
the long run but there's also an
individual psychological impact it's

01:11:28,010 --> 01:11:28,020
individual psychological impact it's
 

4177

individual psychological impact it's
like a vicious negative feedback cycle

01:11:30,350 --> 01:11:30,360
like a vicious negative feedback cycle
 

4179
01:11:30,360 --> 01:11:32,450
like a vicious negative feedback cycle

4217
01:12:08,940 --> 01:12:11,209
team wins it's Universal because it's
part of our we're coding and so is

4218
01:12:11,209 --> 01:12:11,219
part of our we're coding and so is
 

4219
01:12:11,219 --> 01:12:12,590
part of our we're coding and so is
disgust to kind of make this like you

vomit whatever
 

4235
01:12:26,460 --> 01:12:27,890
vomit whatever
but they did this interesting study

4236
01:12:27,890 --> 01:12:27,900
but they did this interesting study
 

4237
01:12:27,900 --> 01:12:29,930
but they did this interesting study
where people

4238
01:12:29,930 --> 01:12:29,940
where people
 

4239
01:12:29,940 --> 01:12:32,930
where people
who in in two two groups the control

4240
01:12:32,930 --> 01:12:32,940
who in in two two groups the control
 

4241
01:12:32,940 --> 01:12:36,410
who in in two two groups the control
group you know was shown images of

group you know was shown images of
 

4243
01:12:36,420 --> 01:12:37,850
group you know was shown images of
um in my beginning two studies mixed up

4244
01:12:37,850 --> 01:12:37,860
um in my beginning two studies mixed up
 

4245
01:12:37,860 --> 01:12:38,689
um in my beginning two studies mixed up
but they were showing they were showing

4246
01:12:38,689 --> 01:12:38,699

dehumanizing emotion so
 

4303
01:13:32,699 --> 01:13:35,390
dehumanizing emotion so
anyway we were we were we were talking

4304
01:13:35,390 --> 01:13:35,400
anyway we were we were we were talking
 

4305
01:13:35,400 --> 01:13:36,410
anyway we were we were we were talking
about

4306
01:13:36,410 --> 01:13:36,420
about
 

4307
01:13:36,420 --> 01:13:38,510
about
um covid but I think it does it Taps

4308
01:13:38,510 --> 01:13:38,520
um covid but I think it does it Taps
 

4309
01:13:38,520 --> 01:13:40,130
um covid but I think it does it Taps
deep into like the human psyche in it

4310
01:13:40,130 --> 01:13:40,140
deep into like the human psyche in it
 

4311
01:13:40,140 --> 01:13:41,510
deep into like the human psyche in it
and it's I don't think it brings out our

4312
01:13:41,510 --> 01:13:41,520
and it's I don't think it brings out our
 

4313
01:13:41,520 --> 01:13:42,950
and it's I don't think it brings out our
I think like you said I think it brings

4314
01:13:42,950 --> 01:13:42,960
I think like you said I think it brings
 

4315
01:13:42,960 --> 01:13:44,810
I think like you said I think it brings
out an ugly side in US

4316
01:13:44,810 --> 01:13:44,820
out an ugly side in US
 

4317
01:13:44,820 --> 01:13:48,050
out an ugly side in US
you describe an idea lab as uh being

4318
01:13:48,050 --> 01:13:48,060
you describe an idea lab as uh being
 

4319
01:13:48,060 --> 01:13:50,090
you describe an idea lab as uh being
opposite of echo Chambers

4320
01:13:50,090 --> 01:13:50,100
opposite of echo Chambers
 

4321
01:13:50,100 --> 01:13:51,709
opposite of echo Chambers
so we know what Echo Chambers are and

4322
01:13:51,709 --> 01:13:51,719
so we know what Echo Chambers are and
 

4323
01:13:51,719 --> 01:13:53,630
so we know what Echo Chambers are and
you said like there's basically no good

4324
01:13:53,630 --> 01:13:53,640
you said like there's basically no good
 

4325
01:13:53,640 --> 01:13:56,149
you said like there's basically no good
term for the opposite of an echo chamber

4326
01:13:56,149 --> 01:13:56,159
term for the opposite of an echo chamber
 

4327
01:13:56,159 --> 01:13:58,970
term for the opposite of an echo chamber
so what's an ideal lab yeah well first

4328
01:13:58,970 --> 01:13:58,980
so what's an ideal lab yeah well first
 

4329
01:13:58,980 --> 01:14:00,770
so what's an ideal lab yeah well first
of all both of these we think of an echo

4330
01:14:00,770 --> 01:14:00,780
of all both of these we think of an echo
 

4331
01:14:00,780 --> 01:14:02,810
of all both of these we think of an echo
chamber as like a group maybe or even a

4332
01:14:02,810 --> 01:14:02,820
chamber as like a group maybe or even a
 

4333
01:14:02,820 --> 01:14:04,790
chamber as like a group maybe or even a
place but it's it's a culture it's an

4334
01:14:04,790 --> 01:14:04,800
place but it's it's a culture it's an
 

4335
01:14:04,800 --> 01:14:06,590
place but it's it's a culture it's an
intellectual culture

4336
01:14:06,590 --> 01:14:06,600
intellectual culture
 

4337
01:14:06,600 --> 01:14:08,630
intellectual culture
and this goes along with the high run

4338
01:14:08,630 --> 01:14:08,640
and this goes along with the high run
 

4339
01:14:08,640 --> 01:14:10,189
and this goes along with the high run
low so high rung and low wrong thinking

4340
01:14:10,189 --> 01:14:10,199
low so high rung and low wrong thinking
 

4341
01:14:10,199 --> 01:14:11,750
low so high rung and low wrong thinking
is individual so I was talking about

4342
01:14:11,750 --> 01:14:11,760
is individual so I was talking about
 

4343
01:14:11,760 --> 01:14:13,070
is individual so I was talking about
what's going on in your head but this is

4344
01:14:13,070 --> 01:14:13,080
what's going on in your head but this is
 

4345
01:14:13,080 --> 01:14:15,590
what's going on in your head but this is
very connected to the Social Scene

4346
01:14:15,590 --> 01:14:15,600
very connected to the Social Scene
 

4347
01:14:15,600 --> 01:14:19,550

like are they still friends right and
ideal lab is nice for the people in them

4500
01:17:01,070 --> 01:17:01,080
ideal lab is nice for the people in them
 

4501
01:17:01,080 --> 01:17:04,070
ideal lab is nice for the people in them
because you're it individuals Thrive you

4502
01:17:04,070 --> 01:17:04,080
because you're it individuals Thrive you
 

4503
01:17:04,080 --> 01:17:05,689
because you're it individuals Thrive you
don't want to just conform that does it

4504
01:17:05,689 --> 01:17:05,699
don't want to just conform that does it
 

4505
01:17:05,699 --> 01:17:07,189
don't want to just conform that does it
makes you seem boring in an idea but you

4506
01:17:07,189 --> 01:17:07,199
makes you seem boring in an idea but you
 

4507
01:17:07,199 --> 01:17:08,149
makes you seem boring in an idea but you
want to be yourself you want to

4508
01:17:08,149 --> 01:17:08,159
want to be yourself you want to
 

4509
01:17:08,159 --> 01:17:09,169
want to be yourself you want to
challenge things you want to have a

4510
01:17:09,169 --> 01:17:09,179
challenge things you want to have a
 

4511
01:17:09,179 --> 01:17:11,689
challenge things you want to have a
unique brain so that's great and and you

4512
01:17:11,689 --> 01:17:11,699
unique brain so that's great and and you
 

4513
01:17:11,699 --> 01:17:13,250
unique brain so that's great and and you
also have people criticizing your ideas

4514
01:17:13,250 --> 01:17:13,260
also have people criticizing your ideas
 

4515
01:17:13,260 --> 01:17:14,570
also have people criticizing your ideas
which makes you smarter it doesn't

4516
01:17:14,570 --> 01:17:14,580
which makes you smarter it doesn't
 

4517
01:17:14,580 --> 01:17:16,669
which makes you smarter it doesn't
always feel good but you you become more

4518
01:17:16,669 --> 01:17:16,679
always feel good but you you become more
 

4519
01:17:16,679 --> 01:17:19,669
always feel good but you you become more
correct and smarter an echo chamber is

4520
01:17:19,669 --> 01:17:19,679
correct and smarter an echo chamber is
 

4521
01:17:19,679 --> 01:17:20,990
correct and smarter an echo chamber is
the opposite where it's not good for the

4522
01:17:20,990 --> 01:17:21,000
the opposite where it's not good for the
 

4523
01:17:21,000 --> 01:17:23,090
the opposite where it's not good for the
people and it does your learning skills

4524
01:17:23,090 --> 01:17:23,100
people and it does your learning skills
 

4525
01:17:23,100 --> 01:17:24,530
people and it does your learning skills
atrophy

4526
01:17:24,530 --> 01:17:24,540
atrophy
 

4527
01:17:24,540 --> 01:17:27,050
atrophy
um and uh and I think it's boring but

4528
01:17:27,050 --> 01:17:27,060
um and uh and I think it's boring but
 

4529
01:17:27,060 --> 01:17:28,370
um and uh and I think it's boring but
the thing is they also have emergent

4530
01:17:28,370 --> 01:17:28,380
the thing is they also have emergent
 

4531
01:17:28,380 --> 01:17:30,229
the thing is they also have emergent
properties so

4532
01:17:30,229 --> 01:17:30,239
properties so
 

4533
01:17:30,239 --> 01:17:32,990
properties so
the emergent property of an ID lab is

4534
01:17:32,990 --> 01:17:33,000
the emergent property of an ID lab is
 

4535
01:17:33,000 --> 01:17:35,390
the emergent property of an ID lab is
like super intelligence just you and me

4536
01:17:35,390 --> 01:17:35,400
like super intelligence just you and me
 

4537
01:17:35,400 --> 01:17:38,270
like super intelligence just you and me
alone just the two of us if we're

4538
01:17:38,270 --> 01:17:38,280
alone just the two of us if we're
 

4539
01:17:38,280 --> 01:17:39,950
alone just the two of us if we're
working together on something but we're

4540
01:17:39,950 --> 01:17:39,960
working together on something but we're
 

4541
01:17:39,960 --> 01:17:41,270
working together on something but we're
being really

4542
01:17:41,270 --> 01:17:41,280
being really
 

4543
01:17:41,280 --> 01:17:42,950
being really
um grown up about it we're disagreeing

4544
01:17:42,950 --> 01:17:42,960
um grown up about it we're disagreeing
 

4545
01:17:42,960 --> 01:17:44,810
um grown up about it we're disagreeing
we're not you know no one's sensitive

4546
01:17:44,810 --> 01:17:44,820
we're not you know no one's sensitive
 

4547
01:17:44,820 --> 01:17:46,669
we're not you know no one's sensitive
about anything we're going to each find

4548
01:17:46,669 --> 01:17:46,679
about anything we're going to each find
 

4549
01:17:46,679 --> 01:17:48,229
about anything we're going to each find
flaws in the other ones arguments that

4550
01:17:48,229 --> 01:17:48,239
flaws in the other ones arguments that
 

4551
01:17:48,239 --> 01:17:50,510
flaws in the other ones arguments that
you wouldn't have found on your own and

4552
01:17:50,510 --> 01:17:50,520
you wouldn't have found on your own and
 

4553
01:17:50,520 --> 01:17:52,250
you wouldn't have found on your own and
we're going to have a piffy double the

4554
01:17:52,250 --> 01:17:52,260
we're going to have a piffy double the
 

4555
01:17:52,260 --> 01:17:53,689
we're going to have a piffy double the
epiphanies right so it's almost like the

4556
01:17:53,689 --> 01:17:53,699
epiphanies right so it's almost like the
 

4557
01:17:53,699 --> 01:17:55,310
epiphanies right so it's almost like the
two of us together is like as smart as

4558
01:17:55,310 --> 01:17:55,320
two of us together is like as smart as
 

4559
01:17:55,320 --> 01:17:58,010
two of us together is like as smart as
1.5 it's like 50 smarter than either of

4560
01:17:58,010 --> 01:17:58,020
1.5 it's like 50 smarter than either of
 

4561
01:17:58,020 --> 01:17:59,590
1.5 it's like 50 smarter than either of
us alone right so you have this 1.5

4562
01:17:59,590 --> 01:17:59,600
us alone right so you have this 1.5
 

4563
01:17:59,600 --> 01:18:02,630
us alone right so you have this 1.5
intelligent kind of joint being that

4564
01:18:02,630 --> 01:18:02,640
intelligent kind of joint being that
 

4565
01:18:02,640 --> 01:18:04,610
intelligent kind of joint being that
we've made now bring the third person in

4566
01:18:04,610 --> 01:18:04,620
we've made now bring the third person in
 

4567
01:18:04,620 --> 01:18:06,050
we've made now bring the third person in
fourth person in right you see it starts

4568
01:18:06,050 --> 01:18:06,060
fourth person in right you see it starts
 

4569
01:18:06,060 --> 01:18:07,689
fourth person in right you see it starts
to scale up this is why science

4570
01:18:07,689 --> 01:18:07,699
to scale up this is why science
 

4571
01:18:07,699 --> 01:18:12,050
to scale up this is why science
institutions can discover relativity in

4572
01:18:12,050 --> 01:18:12,060
institutions can discover relativity in
 

4573
01:18:12,060 --> 01:18:13,370
institutions can discover relativity in
quantum mechanics and these things that

4574
01:18:13,370 --> 01:18:13,380
quantum mechanics and these things that
 

4575
01:18:13,380 --> 01:18:15,169
quantum mechanics and these things that
no individual human you know was going

4576
01:18:15,169 --> 01:18:15,179
no individual human you know was going
 

4577
01:18:15,179 --> 01:18:16,729
no individual human you know was going
to come up with without a ton of

4578
01:18:16,729 --> 01:18:16,739
to come up with without a ton of
 

4579
01:18:16,739 --> 01:18:18,830
to come up with without a ton of
collaboration because it's this giant

4580
01:18:18,830 --> 01:18:18,840
collaboration because it's this giant
 

4581
01:18:18,840 --> 01:18:20,750
collaboration because it's this giant
idea lab so it has an emergent property

4582
01:18:20,750 --> 01:18:20,760
idea lab so it has an emergent property
 

4583
01:18:20,760 --> 01:18:23,750
idea lab so it has an emergent property
of super intelligence an echo chamber is

4584
01:18:23,750 --> 01:18:23,760
of super intelligence an echo chamber is
 

4585
01:18:23,760 --> 01:18:25,729
of super intelligence an echo chamber is
the opposite where it has the emergent

4586
01:18:25,729 --> 01:18:25,739
the opposite where it has the emergent
 

4587
01:18:25,739 --> 01:18:28,490
the opposite where it has the emergent
property of

4588
01:18:28,490 --> 01:18:28,500
property of
 

4589
01:18:28,500 --> 01:18:30,050
property of
stupidity I mean has the emergent

4590
01:18:30,050 --> 01:18:30,060
stupidity I mean has the emergent
 

4591
01:18:30,060 --> 01:18:32,270
stupidity I mean has the emergent
property of a bunch of people all you

4592
01:18:32,270 --> 01:18:32,280
property of a bunch of people all you
 

4593
01:18:32,280 --> 01:18:33,649
property of a bunch of people all you
know you know paying field you know

4594
01:18:33,649 --> 01:18:33,659
know you know paying field you know
 

4595
01:18:33,659 --> 01:18:36,830
know you know paying field you know
fealty to this set of sacred ideas and

4596
01:18:36,830 --> 01:18:36,840
fealty to this set of sacred ideas and
 

4597
01:18:36,840 --> 01:18:39,470
fealty to this set of sacred ideas and
and um so you lose this magical thing

4598
01:18:39,470 --> 01:18:39,480
and um so you lose this magical thing
 

4599
01:18:39,480 --> 01:18:41,570
and um so you lose this magical thing
about language and humans which is

4600
01:18:41,570 --> 01:18:41,580
about language and humans which is
 

4601
01:18:41,580 --> 01:18:43,550
about language and humans which is
collaborative intelligence you lose it

4602
01:18:43,550 --> 01:18:43,560
collaborative intelligence you lose it
 

4603
01:18:43,560 --> 01:18:47,149
collaborative intelligence you lose it
it disappears but there is that axis of

4604
01:18:47,149 --> 01:18:47,159
it disappears but there is that axis of
 

4605
01:18:47,159 --> 01:18:49,430
it disappears but there is that axis of
decency which is really interesting

4606
01:18:49,430 --> 01:18:49,440
decency which is really interesting
 

4607
01:18:49,440 --> 01:18:50,990
decency which is really interesting
because you kind of painted this picture

4608
01:18:50,990 --> 01:18:51,000
because you kind of painted this picture
 

4609
01:18:51,000 --> 01:18:52,729
because you kind of painted this picture
of you and your friends arguing really

4610
01:18:52,729 --> 01:18:52,739
of you and your friends arguing really
 

4611
01:18:52,739 --> 01:18:56,510
of you and your friends arguing really
harshly but underlying that

4612
01:18:56,510 --> 01:18:56,520
harshly but underlying that
 

4613
01:18:56,520 --> 01:19:00,950
harshly but underlying that
is a basic camaraderie respect there's

4614
01:19:00,950 --> 01:19:00,960
is a basic camaraderie respect there's
 

4615
01:19:00,960 --> 01:19:02,630
is a basic camaraderie respect there's
there's a

there's a
 

4617
01:19:02,640 --> 01:19:04,850
there's a
all kinds of mechanisms we humans have

4618
01:19:04,850 --> 01:19:04,860
all kinds of mechanisms we humans have
 

4619
01:19:04,860 --> 01:19:06,830
all kinds of mechanisms we humans have
constructed to communicate

people are respected in an idea lab and
 

4637
01:19:22,980 --> 01:19:24,950
people are respected in an idea lab and
ideas are disrespected and there's way

4638
01:19:24,950 --> 01:19:24,960
ideas are disrespected and there's way
 

4639
01:19:24,960 --> 01:19:27,830
ideas are disrespected and there's way
ways to signal that so like for with

and the algorithm helps those people

4802
01:22:23,090 --> 01:22:23,100
and the algorithm helps those people
 

4803
01:22:23,100 --> 01:22:24,890
and the algorithm helps those people
does those people do great on the

4804
01:22:24,890 --> 01:22:24,900
does those people do great on the
 

4805
01:22:24,900 --> 01:22:27,050
does those people do great on the
algorithm this is a fascinating Dynamic

4806
01:22:27,050 --> 01:22:27,060
algorithm this is a fascinating Dynamic
 

4807
01:22:27,060 --> 01:22:29,750
algorithm this is a fascinating Dynamic
that happens uh because I have I've

4808

4961
01:25:04,320 --> 01:25:06,770
looked down one of them and I realized
like almost all of this is the work of

4962
01:25:06,770 --> 01:25:06,780
like almost all of this is the work of
 

4963
01:25:06,780 --> 01:25:08,870
like almost all of this is the work of
like three people yeah that's who you

01:25:10,370 --> 01:25:10,380
need to block those people need to be
 

4967
01:25:10,380 --> 01:25:12,110
need to block those people need to be
blocked you're not being thin-skinned

blocked you're not being thin-skinned
you're not being petty doing it you're

4970
01:25:13,850 --> 01:25:13,860
you're not being petty doing it you're
 

4971
01:25:13,860 --> 01:25:17,149
you're not being petty doing it you're
actually protecting an idea lab because

4972
01:25:17,149 --> 01:25:17,159
actually protecting an idea lab because
 

4973
01:25:17,159 --> 01:25:18,709
actually protecting an idea lab because
what people would really aggressive

4974
01:25:18,709 --> 01:25:18,719
what people would really aggressive
 

4975
01:25:18,719 --> 01:25:20,030
what people would really aggressive
people like that do is they'll turn it

4976
01:25:20,030 --> 01:25:20,040
people like that do is they'll turn it
 

4977
01:25:20,040 --> 01:25:22,130
people like that do is they'll turn it
into their own Echo chamber because now

4978
01:25:22,130 --> 01:25:22,140
into their own Echo chamber because now
 

4979
01:25:22,140 --> 01:25:23,450
into their own Echo chamber because now
everyone is scared to kind of disagree

4980
01:25:23,450 --> 01:25:23,460
everyone is scared to kind of disagree
 

4981
01:25:23,460 --> 01:25:25,130
everyone is scared to kind of disagree
with them this is unpleasant and so

4982
01:25:25,130 --> 01:25:25,140
with them this is unpleasant and so
 

4983
01:25:25,140 --> 01:25:26,689
with them this is unpleasant and so
people who will chime in are the people

4984
01:25:26,689 --> 01:25:26,699
people who will chime in are the people
 

4985
01:25:26,699 --> 01:25:28,010
people who will chime in are the people
who agree with them and suddenly like

4986
01:25:28,010 --> 01:25:28,020
who agree with them and suddenly like
 

4987
01:25:28,020 --> 01:25:30,169
who agree with them and suddenly like
they've taken over the space and I kind

4988
01:25:30,169 --> 01:25:30,179
they've taken over the space and I kind
 

4989
01:25:30,179 --> 01:25:32,209
they've taken over the space and I kind
of believe that those people on a

4990
01:25:32,209 --> 01:25:32,219
of believe that those people on a
 

4991
01:25:32,219 --> 01:25:33,709
of believe that those people on a
different day could actually do high

4992
01:25:33,709 --> 01:25:33,719
different day could actually do high
 

4993
01:25:33,719 --> 01:25:35,510
different day could actually do high
effort disagreement it's just that

4994
01:25:35,510 --> 01:25:35,520
effort disagreement it's just that
 

4995
01:25:35,520 --> 01:25:37,370
effort disagreement it's just that
they're in a in a certain kind of mood

4996
01:25:37,370 --> 01:25:37,380
they're in a in a certain kind of mood
 

4997
01:25:37,380 --> 01:25:39,169
they're in a in a certain kind of mood
and a lot of us just like you said with

4998
01:25:39,169 --> 01:25:39,179
and a lot of us just like you said with
 

4999
01:25:39,179 --> 01:25:40,910
and a lot of us just like you said with
the Primitive mind could get into that

5000
01:25:40,910 --> 01:25:40,920
the Primitive mind could get into that
 

5001
01:25:40,920 --> 01:25:43,970
the Primitive mind could get into that
mood and it's I believe it's actually

5002
01:25:43,970 --> 01:25:43,980
mood and it's I believe it's actually
 

5003
01:25:43,980 --> 01:25:46,010
mood and it's I believe it's actually
the job of the technology of the

5004
01:25:46,010 --> 01:25:46,020
the job of the technology of the
 

5005
01:25:46,020 --> 01:25:48,050
the job of the technology of the
platform to incentivize those folks to

5006
01:25:48,050 --> 01:25:48,060
platform to incentivize those folks to
 

5007
01:25:48,060 --> 01:25:51,110
platform to incentivize those folks to
be like are you sure this is the best

5008
01:25:51,110 --> 01:25:51,120
be like are you sure this is the best
 

5009
01:25:51,120 --> 01:25:53,270
be like are you sure this is the best
you can do like if you really want to

5010
01:25:53,270 --> 01:25:53,280
you can do like if you really want to
 

5011
01:25:53,280 --> 01:25:55,790
you can do like if you really want to
talk [\h__\h] about this idea like do better

5012
01:25:55,790 --> 01:25:55,800
talk [\h__\h] about this idea like do better
 

5013
01:25:55,800 --> 01:25:58,430
talk [\h__\h] about this idea like do better
like yeah and then we need to create

5014
01:25:58,430 --> 01:25:58,440
like yeah and then we need to create
 

5015
01:25:58,440 --> 01:26:01,129
like yeah and then we need to create
incentives where you get likes for high

5016
01:26:01,129 --> 01:26:01,139
incentives where you get likes for high
 

5017
01:26:01,139 --> 01:26:03,229
incentives where you get likes for high
effort disagreement because currently

5018
01:26:03,229 --> 01:26:03,239
effort disagreement because currently
 

5019
01:26:03,239 --> 01:26:06,050
effort disagreement because currently
you get likes for like uh something

5020
01:26:06,050 --> 01:26:06,060
you get likes for like uh something
 

5021
01:26:06,060 --> 01:26:08,629
you get likes for like uh something
that's slightly funny and is a little

5022
01:26:08,629 --> 01:26:08,639
that's slightly funny and is a little
 

5023
01:26:08,639 --> 01:26:10,129
that's slightly funny and is a little
bit like mockery

5024
01:26:10,129 --> 01:26:10,139
bit like mockery
 

5025
01:26:10,139 --> 01:26:11,870
bit like mockery
like um

5026
01:26:11,870 --> 01:26:11,880
like um
 

5027
01:26:11,880 --> 01:26:14,209
like um
yeah basically signals to some kind of

5028
01:26:14,209 --> 01:26:14,219
yeah basically signals to some kind of
 

5029
01:26:14,219 --> 01:26:17,510
yeah basically signals to some kind of
echo chamber that this person is a

5030
01:26:17,510 --> 01:26:17,520
echo chamber that this person is a
 

5031
01:26:17,520 --> 01:26:19,310
echo chamber that this person is a
horrible person it's a hypocrite as evil

5032
01:26:19,310 --> 01:26:19,320
horrible person it's a hypocrite as evil
 

5033
01:26:19,320 --> 01:26:22,310
horrible person it's a hypocrite as evil
whatever that feels like it's solvable

5034
01:26:22,310 --> 01:26:22,320
whatever that feels like it's solvable
 

5035
01:26:22,320 --> 01:26:24,050
whatever that feels like it's solvable
with technology because I think in our

5036
01:26:24,050 --> 01:26:24,060
with technology because I think in our
 

5037
01:26:24,060 --> 01:26:26,450
with technology because I think in our
private lives none of us want that I

5038
01:26:26,450 --> 01:26:26,460
private lives none of us want that I
 

5039
01:26:26,460 --> 01:26:27,890
private lives none of us want that I
wonder if it's making me think that I

5040
01:26:27,890 --> 01:26:27,900
wonder if it's making me think that I
 

5041
01:26:27,900 --> 01:26:30,410
wonder if it's making me think that I
want to like because a much easier way

5042
01:26:30,410 --> 01:26:30,420
want to like because a much easier way
 

5043
01:26:30,420 --> 01:26:32,570
want to like because a much easier way
for me to do it just for my

5044
01:26:32,570 --> 01:26:32,580
for me to do it just for my
 

5045
01:26:32,580 --> 01:26:34,729
for me to do it just for my
my world would be to say something like

5046
01:26:34,729 --> 01:26:34,739
my world would be to say something like
 

5047
01:26:34,739 --> 01:26:37,370
my world would be to say something like
you know here's this axis this high this

5048
01:26:37,370 --> 01:26:37,380
you know here's this axis this high this
 

5049
01:26:37,380 --> 01:26:39,290
you know here's this axis this high this
is this is part of what I part of what I

5050
01:26:39,290 --> 01:26:39,300
is this is part of what I part of what I
 

5051
01:26:39,300 --> 01:26:40,850
is this is part of what I part of what I
like about the latter is is it's a

5052
01:26:40,850 --> 01:26:40,860
like about the latter is is it's a
 

5053
01:26:40,860 --> 01:26:41,990
like about the latter is is it's a
language that we can use it's like

5054
01:26:41,990 --> 01:26:42,000
language that we can use it's like
 

5055
01:26:42,000 --> 01:26:44,870
language that we can use it's like
specifically what we're talking about is

5056
01:26:44,870 --> 01:26:44,880
specifically what we're talking about is
 

5057
01:26:44,880 --> 01:26:47,570
specifically what we're talking about is
High rung disagreement good low rung

5058
01:26:47,570 --> 01:26:47,580
High rung disagreement good low rung
 

5059
01:26:47,580 --> 01:26:49,370
High rung disagreement good low rung
disagreement bad right and so so it

5060
01:26:49,370 --> 01:26:49,380
disagreement bad right and so so it
 

5061
01:26:49,380 --> 01:26:50,689
disagreement bad right and so so it
gives us like a language for that and so

5062
01:26:50,689 --> 01:26:50,699
gives us like a language for that and so
 

5063
01:26:50,699 --> 01:26:52,070
gives us like a language for that and so
what I would say is I would you know my

5064
01:26:52,070 --> 01:26:52,080
what I would say is I would you know my
 

5065
01:26:52,080 --> 01:26:53,689
what I would say is I would you know my
you know I would have my you know

01:26:53,689 --> 01:26:53,699
you know I would have my you know
 

5067
01:26:53,699 --> 01:26:55,729
you know I would have my you know
readers you know understand this axis

readers you know understand this axis
 

5069
01:26:55,739 --> 01:26:57,350
readers you know understand this axis
and then I would specifically say

5070
01:26:57,350 --> 01:26:57,360
and then I would specifically say
 

5071
01:26:57,360 --> 01:26:59,209
and then I would specifically say
something like please

5072
01:26:59,209 --> 01:26:59,219
something like please

love it's forgiveness it's all these
things they're the opposite of grievance

5422
01:32:50,209 --> 01:32:50,219
things they're the opposite of grievance

pessimism right and
there's I think a reason that a lot of

5428
01:32:57,890 --> 01:32:57,900
there's I think a reason that a lot of
 

5429
01:32:57,900 --> 01:32:59,990
there's I think a reason that a lot of
people follow you because it is

5430
01:32:59,990 --> 01:33:00,000
people follow you because it is
 

5431
01:33:00,000 --> 01:33:01,669
people follow you because it is
contagious it makes other people feel

5432
01:33:01,669 --> 01:33:01,679
contagious it makes other people feel
 

5433
01:33:01,679 --> 01:33:03,890
contagious it makes other people feel
those feelings I don't know there's been

5434
01:33:03,890 --> 01:33:03,900
those feelings I don't know there's been
 

5435
01:33:03,900 --> 01:33:07,010
those feelings I don't know there's been
I've been recently over the past few

5436
01:33:07,010 --> 01:33:07,020
I've been recently over the past few
 

5437
01:33:07,020 --> 01:33:09,350
I've been recently over the past few
months attacked quite a lot it is

5438
01:33:09,350 --> 01:33:09,360
months attacked quite a lot it is
 

5439
01:33:09,360 --> 01:33:10,970
months attacked quite a lot it is
fascinating to watch because there's is

5440
01:33:10,970 --> 01:33:10,980
fascinating to watch because there's is
 

5441
01:33:10,980 --> 01:33:13,610
fascinating to watch because there's is
over things that I think I probably have

5442
01:33:13,610 --> 01:33:13,620
over things that I think I probably have
 

5443
01:33:13,620 --> 01:33:15,229
over things that I think I probably have
done stupid things but I'm being

5444
01:33:15,229 --> 01:33:15,239
done stupid things but I'm being
 

5445
01:33:15,239 --> 01:33:17,689
done stupid things but I'm being
attacked for things that are totally not

5446
01:33:17,689 --> 01:33:17,699
attacked for things that are totally not
 

5447
01:33:17,699 --> 01:33:20,750
attacked for things that are totally not
worthy of attack I got attacked for a

5448
01:33:20,750 --> 01:33:20,760
worthy of attack I got attacked for a
 

5449
01:33:20,760 --> 01:33:22,010
worthy of attack I got attacked for a
book list

5450
01:33:22,010 --> 01:33:22,020
book list
 

5451
01:33:22,020 --> 01:33:23,689
book list
I saw that by the way I thought I

5452
01:33:23,689 --> 01:33:23,699
I saw that by the way I thought I
 

5453
01:33:23,699 --> 01:33:25,669
I saw that by the way I thought I
thought it was great but like you can

5454
01:33:25,669 --> 01:33:25,679
thought it was great but like you can
 

5455
01:33:25,679 --> 01:33:29,689
thought it was great but like you can
always kind of find ways to you know I

5456
01:33:29,689 --> 01:33:29,699
always kind of find ways to you know I
 

5457
01:33:29,699 --> 01:33:31,970
always kind of find ways to you know I
guess the assumption is this person

5458
01:33:31,970 --> 01:33:31,980
guess the assumption is this person
 

5459
01:33:31,980 --> 01:33:34,790
guess the assumption is this person
surely is a fraud or some other

5460
01:33:34,790 --> 01:33:34,800
surely is a fraud or some other
 

5461
01:33:34,800 --> 01:33:36,649
surely is a fraud or some other
explanation he's sure it has dead bodies

5462
01:33:36,649 --> 01:33:36,659
explanation he's sure it has dead bodies
 

5463
01:33:36,659 --> 01:33:38,030
explanation he's sure it has dead bodies
in the basement he's hiding or something

5464
01:33:38,030 --> 01:33:38,040
in the basement he's hiding or something
 

5465
01:33:38,040 --> 01:33:39,950
in the basement he's hiding or something
like this and then I'm going to

5466
01:33:39,950 --> 01:33:39,960
like this and then I'm going to
 

5467
01:33:39,960 --> 01:33:41,570
like this and then I'm going to
construct The Narrative around that and

5468
01:33:41,570 --> 01:33:41,580
construct The Narrative around that and
 

5469
01:33:41,580 --> 01:33:43,490
construct The Narrative around that and
ma can attack that I don't know how that

5470
01:33:43,490 --> 01:33:43,500
ma can attack that I don't know how that
 

5471
01:33:43,500 --> 01:33:45,890
ma can attack that I don't know how that
works but there there is um there does

5472
01:33:45,890 --> 01:33:45,900
works but there there is um there does
 

5473
01:33:45,900 --> 01:33:47,270
works but there there is um there does
and I think you write this in the book

5474
01:33:47,270 --> 01:33:47,280
and I think you write this in the book
 

5475
01:33:47,280 --> 01:33:49,669
and I think you write this in the book
there seems to be a gravity

5476
01:33:49,669 --> 01:33:49,679
there seems to be a gravity
 

5477
01:33:49,679 --> 01:33:51,950
there seems to be a gravity
pulling people towards the Primitive

5478
01:33:51,950 --> 01:33:51,960
pulling people towards the Primitive
 

5479
01:33:51,960 --> 01:33:55,209
pulling people towards the Primitive
mindedness to anything political right

5480
01:33:55,209 --> 01:33:55,219
mindedness to anything political right
 

5481
01:33:55,219 --> 01:33:58,370
mindedness to anything political right
religious certain things sure are bottom

5482
01:33:58,370 --> 01:33:58,380
religious certain things sure are bottom
 

5483
01:33:58,380 --> 01:34:00,590
religious certain things sure are bottom
heavy you know yeah for our psyche they

5484
01:34:00,590 --> 01:34:00,600
heavy you know yeah for our psyche they
 

5485
01:34:00,600 --> 01:34:02,270
heavy you know yeah for our psyche they
they they they they they they have a

5486
01:34:02,270 --> 01:34:02,280
they they they they they they have a
 

5487
01:34:02,280 --> 01:34:04,430
they they they they they they have a
magnet that pulls our psyches downwards

5488
01:34:04,430 --> 01:34:04,440
magnet that pulls our psyches downwards
 

5489
01:34:04,440 --> 01:34:06,050
magnet that pulls our psyches downwards
on the ladder and and why why does

5490
01:34:06,050 --> 01:34:06,060
on the ladder and and why why does
 

5491
01:34:06,060 --> 01:34:07,729
on the ladder and and why why does
politics pull our psyches

5492
01:34:07,729 --> 01:34:07,739
politics pull our psyches
 

5493
01:34:07,739 --> 01:34:11,090
politics pull our psyches
down on the ladder because it

5494
01:34:11,090 --> 01:34:11,100
down on the ladder because it
 

5495
01:34:11,100 --> 01:34:13,850
down on the ladder because it
for for the tens of thousand years that

5496
01:34:13,850 --> 01:34:13,860
for for the tens of thousand years that
 

5497
01:34:13,860 --> 01:34:16,490
for for the tens of thousand years that
we were evolving

5498
01:34:16,490 --> 01:34:16,500
we were evolving
 

5499
01:34:16,500 --> 01:34:19,250
we were evolving
um you know during human history it was

5500
01:34:19,250 --> 01:34:19,260
um you know during human history it was
 

5501
01:34:19,260 --> 01:34:20,390
um you know during human history it was
life or death

5502
01:34:20,390 --> 01:34:20,400
life or death
 

5503
01:34:20,400 --> 01:34:22,010
life or death
politics was life or death and and and

5504
01:34:22,010 --> 01:34:22,020
politics was life or death and and and
 

5505
01:34:22,020 --> 01:34:23,930
politics was life or death and and and
so

5506
01:34:23,930 --> 01:34:23,940
so
 

5507
01:34:23,940 --> 01:34:25,910
so
um it was actually an amazing study

5508
01:34:25,910 --> 01:34:25,920
um it was actually an amazing study
 

5509
01:34:25,920 --> 01:34:27,410
um it was actually an amazing study
where it's like

5510
01:34:27,410 --> 01:34:27,420
where it's like
 

5511
01:34:27,420 --> 01:34:28,970
where it's like
um they

5512
01:34:28,970 --> 01:34:28,980
um they
 

5513
01:34:28,980 --> 01:34:31,610
um they
challenged like 20 different beliefs of

5514
01:34:31,610 --> 01:34:31,620
challenged like 20 different beliefs of
 

5515
01:34:31,620 --> 01:34:34,250
challenged like 20 different beliefs of
a person and different parts of the

5516
01:34:34,250 --> 01:34:34,260
a person and different parts of the
 

5517
01:34:34,260 --> 01:34:36,470
a person and different parts of the
person's brain and they had an MRI going

5518
01:34:36,470 --> 01:34:36,480
person's brain and they had an MRI going
 

5519
01:34:36,480 --> 01:34:37,729
person's brain and they had an MRI going
different parts of the person's brain

5520
01:34:37,729 --> 01:34:37,739
different parts of the person's brain
 

5521
01:34:37,739 --> 01:34:39,770
different parts of the person's brain
lit up when non-political beliefs were

5522
01:34:39,770 --> 01:34:39,780
lit up when non-political beliefs were
 

5523
01:34:39,780 --> 01:34:41,330
lit up when non-political beliefs were
challenged versus political beasts were

5524
01:34:41,330 --> 01:34:41,340
challenged versus political beasts were
 

5525
01:34:41,340 --> 01:34:43,189
challenged versus political beasts were
challenged when political beliefs were

5526
01:34:43,189 --> 01:34:43,199
challenged when political beliefs were
 

5527
01:34:43,199 --> 01:34:45,169
challenged when political beliefs were
challenged when non-political beliefs

5528
01:34:45,169 --> 01:34:45,179
challenged when non-political beliefs
 

5529
01:34:45,179 --> 01:34:46,189
challenged when non-political beliefs
were challenged

5530
01:34:46,189 --> 01:34:46,199
were challenged
 

5531
01:34:46,199 --> 01:34:47,629
were challenged
the

5532
01:34:47,629 --> 01:34:47,639
the
 

5533
01:34:47,639 --> 01:34:49,310
the
like the the rational like the

5534
01:34:49,310 --> 01:34:49,320
like the the rational like the
 

5535
01:34:49,320 --> 01:34:51,709
like the the rational like the
prefrontal cortex type areas were lit up

5536
01:34:51,709 --> 01:34:51,719
prefrontal cortex type areas were lit up
 

5537
01:34:51,719 --> 01:34:53,330
prefrontal cortex type areas were lit up
when the political beliefs were

5538
01:34:53,330 --> 01:34:53,340
when the political beliefs were
 

5539
01:34:53,340 --> 01:34:55,070
when the political beliefs were
challenged and then I'm getting over my

5540
01:34:55,070 --> 01:34:55,080
challenged and then I'm getting over my
 

5541
01:34:55,080 --> 01:34:56,510
challenged and then I'm getting over my
head here but it's like the the parts of

5542
01:34:56,510 --> 01:34:56,520
head here but it's like the the parts of
 

5543
01:34:56,520 --> 01:34:57,890
head here but it's like the the parts of
your brain the default mode Network the

5544
01:34:57,890 --> 01:34:57,900
your brain the default mode Network the
 

5545
01:34:57,900 --> 01:34:59,390
your brain the default mode Network the
parts of your brain associated with like

5546
01:34:59,390 --> 01:34:59,400
parts of your brain associated with like
 

5547
01:34:59,400 --> 01:35:01,610
parts of your brain associated with like
inter introspection and like your own

5548
01:35:01,610 --> 01:35:01,620
inter introspection and like your own
 

5549
01:35:01,620 --> 01:35:05,510
inter introspection and like your own
identity were lit up and they were much

5550
01:35:05,510 --> 01:35:05,520
identity were lit up and they were much
 

5551
01:35:05,520 --> 01:35:07,610
identity were lit up and they were much
more likely to change their mind on all

5552
01:35:07,610 --> 01:35:07,620
more likely to change their mind on all
 

5553
01:35:07,620 --> 01:35:09,350
more likely to change their mind on all
the beliefs the non-political beliefs

5554
01:35:09,350 --> 01:35:09,360
the beliefs the non-political beliefs
 

5555
01:35:09,360 --> 01:35:11,450
the beliefs the non-political beliefs
when that default mode Network part of

5556
01:35:11,450 --> 01:35:11,460
when that default mode Network part of
 

5557
01:35:11,460 --> 01:35:14,090
when that default mode Network part of
your brain uh lit up you were you were

5558
01:35:14,090 --> 01:35:14,100
your brain uh lit up you were you were
 

5559
01:35:14,100 --> 01:35:16,010
your brain uh lit up you were you were
gonna if anything get more firm in those

5560
01:35:16,010 --> 01:35:16,020
gonna if anything get more firm in those
 

5561
01:35:16,020 --> 01:35:17,149
gonna if anything get more firm in those
beliefs when you when you had them

5562
01:35:17,149 --> 01:35:17,159
beliefs when you when you had them
 

5563
01:35:17,159 --> 01:35:19,189
beliefs when you when you had them
challenged so

5564
01:35:19,189 --> 01:35:19,199
challenged so
 

5565
01:35:19,199 --> 01:35:22,129
challenged so
politics is one of those topics that

5566
01:35:22,129 --> 01:35:22,139
politics is one of those topics that
 

5567
01:35:22,139 --> 01:35:24,110
politics is one of those topics that
just it literally literally lights up

5568
01:35:24,110 --> 01:35:24,120
just it literally literally lights up
 

5569
01:35:24,120 --> 01:35:26,330
just it literally literally lights up
different part of our brain it's again I

5570
01:35:26,330 --> 01:35:26,340
different part of our brain it's again I
 

5571
01:35:26,340 --> 01:35:27,410
different part of our brain it's again I
think we come back to primitive mind

5572
01:35:27,410 --> 01:35:27,420
think we come back to primitive mind
 

5573
01:35:27,420 --> 01:35:30,229
think we come back to primitive mind
higher mind here it's like it it gets

5574
01:35:30,229 --> 01:35:30,239
higher mind here it's like it it gets
 

5575
01:35:30,239 --> 01:35:31,550
higher mind here it's like it it gets
our higher this is one of the things our

5576
01:35:31,550 --> 01:35:31,560
our higher this is one of the things our
 

5577
01:35:31,560 --> 01:35:34,010
our higher this is one of the things our
primitive mind comes programmed to care

5578
01:35:34,010 --> 01:35:34,020
primitive mind comes programmed to care
 

5579
01:35:34,020 --> 01:35:35,750
primitive mind comes programmed to care

I I think that it's not about the tax
policy or anything like that and then

5634
01:36:31,070 --> 01:36:31,080
policy or anything like that and then
 

5635
01:36:31,080 --> 01:36:32,570
policy or anything like that and then
and then it gets tied to this like

5636
01:36:32,570 --> 01:36:32,580
and then it gets tied to this like
 

5637
01:36:32,580 --> 01:36:34,430
and then it gets tied to this like

culture and I've been using kind of a
 

5847
01:40:06,300 --> 01:40:09,649
culture and I've been using kind of a
shorthand uh of Centrist to describe

shorthand uh of Centrist to describe

this kind of
 

5851
01:40:10,980 --> 01:40:14,209
this kind of
a high wrong thinking but people tend to

5865
01:40:27,719 --> 01:40:29,390
um somehow as opposed to ask saying I
don't know is the first statement the

01:40:31,500 --> 01:40:34,129
problem with Centrist is that would mean
that in each of these tax cuts bag tax

5870

that doesn't mean oh I'm not a Centrist

5884
01:40:46,910 --> 01:40:46,920
that doesn't mean oh I'm not a Centrist

that's why we need the second axis so
 

5889
01:40:51,060 --> 01:40:52,310
that's why we need the second axis so
what you're trying to be when you say

5890
01:40:52,310 --> 01:40:52,320
what you're trying to be when you say
 

5891
01:40:52,320 --> 01:40:54,110
what you're trying to be when you say
Centrist is Hiram which means you might

5892
01:40:54,110 --> 01:40:54,120
Centrist is Hiram which means you might
 

5893
01:40:54,120 --> 01:40:55,790
Centrist is Hiram which means you might
be all over the place horizontally you

5894
01:40:55,790 --> 01:40:55,800
be all over the place horizontally you
 

5895
01:40:55,800 --> 01:40:56,990
be all over the place horizontally you
might agree with the far left on this

5896
01:40:56,990 --> 01:40:57,000
might agree with the far left on this
 

5897
01:40:57,000 --> 01:40:58,250
might agree with the far left on this
thing the far right on this thing that

5898
01:40:58,250 --> 01:40:58,260
thing the far right on this thing that
 

5899
01:40:58,260 --> 01:40:59,629
thing the far right on this thing that
you might agree with the centrists on

5900
01:40:59,629 --> 01:40:59,639
you might agree with the centrists on
 

5901
01:40:59,639 --> 01:41:01,910
you might agree with the centrists on
this thing but but calling yourself a

5902
01:41:01,910 --> 01:41:01,920
this thing but but calling yourself a
 

5903
01:41:01,920 --> 01:41:04,070
this thing but but calling yourself a
Centrist actually like is putting

5904
01:41:04,070 --> 01:41:04,080
Centrist actually like is putting
 

5905
01:41:04,080 --> 01:41:06,350
Centrist actually like is putting
yourself in a prison on the horizontal

5906
01:41:06,350 --> 01:41:06,360
yourself in a prison on the horizontal
 

5907
01:41:06,360 --> 01:41:08,510
yourself in a prison on the horizontal
axis and um and it's saying that you

5908
01:41:08,510 --> 01:41:08,520
axis and um and it's saying that you
 

5909
01:41:08,520 --> 01:41:10,129
axis and um and it's saying that you
know I I whatever the on the on the

5910
01:41:10,129 --> 01:41:10,139
know I I whatever the on the on the
 

5911
01:41:10,139 --> 01:41:11,629
know I I whatever the on the on the
different topics I'm right in between

5912
01:41:11,629 --> 01:41:11,639
different topics I'm right in between
 

5913
01:41:11,639 --> 01:41:13,610
different topics I'm right in between
the two policy wise that's not what you

5914
01:41:13,610 --> 01:41:13,620
the two policy wise that's not what you
 

5915
01:41:13,620 --> 01:41:15,890
the two policy wise that's not what you
are so yeah that's what we we're badly

5916
01:41:15,890 --> 01:41:15,900
are so yeah that's what we we're badly
 

5917
01:41:15,900 --> 01:41:18,649
are so yeah that's what we we're badly
missing this other axis yeah I mean I I

5918
01:41:18,649 --> 01:41:18,659
missing this other axis yeah I mean I I
 

5919
01:41:18,659 --> 01:41:20,890
missing this other axis yeah I mean I I
still do think it's this

5920
01:41:20,890 --> 01:41:20,900
still do think it's this
 

5921
01:41:20,900 --> 01:41:23,810
still do think it's this
like for me I am a Centrist when you

5922
01:41:23,810 --> 01:41:23,820
like for me I am a Centrist when you
 

5923
01:41:23,820 --> 01:41:26,270
like for me I am a Centrist when you
project it down to the horizontal but

5924
01:41:26,270 --> 01:41:26,280
project it down to the horizontal but
 

5925
01:41:26,280 --> 01:41:28,330
project it down to the horizontal but
the point is you're missing so much data

5926
01:41:28,330 --> 01:41:28,340
the point is you're missing so much data
 

5927
01:41:28,340 --> 01:41:31,070
the point is you're missing so much data
by not considering the vertical because

5928
01:41:31,070 --> 01:41:31,080
by not considering the vertical because
 

5929
01:41:31,080 --> 01:41:33,470
by not considering the vertical because
like on average maybe it falls somewhere

5930
01:41:33,470 --> 01:41:33,480
like on average maybe it falls somewhere
 

5931
01:41:33,480 --> 01:41:35,689
like on average maybe it falls somewhere
in the middle but in reality there's

5932
01:41:35,689 --> 01:41:35,699
in the middle but in reality there's
 

5933
01:41:35,699 --> 01:41:37,790
in the middle but in reality there's
just a lot of nuance issue to issue that

5934
01:41:37,790 --> 01:41:37,800
just a lot of nuance issue to issue that
 

5935
01:41:37,800 --> 01:41:39,649
just a lot of nuance issue to issue that
involves just thinking and uncertainty

5936
01:41:39,649 --> 01:41:39,659
involves just thinking and uncertainty
 

5937
01:41:39,659 --> 01:41:43,010
involves just thinking and uncertainty
and changing in the given the context of

5938
01:41:43,010 --> 01:41:43,020
and changing in the given the context of
 

5939
01:41:43,020 --> 01:41:46,310
and changing in the given the context of
the current geopolitics and economics

5940
01:41:46,310 --> 01:41:46,320
the current geopolitics and economics
 

5941
01:41:46,320 --> 01:41:47,930
the current geopolitics and economics
and just always considering always

5942
01:41:47,930 --> 01:41:47,940
and just always considering always
 

5943
01:41:47,940 --> 01:41:50,090
and just always considering always
questioning always evolving your views

5944
01:41:50,090 --> 01:41:50,100
questioning always evolving your views
 

5945
01:41:50,100 --> 01:41:51,890
questioning always evolving your views
all of that not just not just about like

5946
01:41:51,890 --> 01:41:51,900
all of that not just not just about like
 

5947
01:41:51,900 --> 01:41:53,750
all of that not just not just about like
oh I think we should be in the center on

5948
01:41:53,750 --> 01:41:53,760
oh I think we should be in the center on
 

5949
01:41:53,760 --> 01:41:55,010
oh I think we should be in the center on
this but another way to be in the center

5950
01:41:55,010 --> 01:41:55,020
this but another way to be in the center
 

5951
01:41:55,020 --> 01:41:57,890
this but another way to be in the center
is if there's some phenomenon happening

5952
01:41:57,890 --> 01:41:57,900
is if there's some phenomenon happening
 

5953
01:41:57,900 --> 01:41:59,510
is if there's some phenomenon happening
um you know there's a terrorist attack

5954
01:41:59,510 --> 01:41:59,520
um you know there's a terrorist attack
 

5955
01:41:59,520 --> 01:42:02,270
um you know there's a terrorist attack
you know and one side wants to say this

5956
01:42:02,270 --> 01:42:02,280
you know and one side wants to say this
 

5957
01:42:02,280 --> 01:42:03,950
you know and one side wants to say this
has nothing to do with Islam and the

5958
01:42:03,950 --> 01:42:03,960
has nothing to do with Islam and the
 

5959
01:42:03,960 --> 01:42:05,030
has nothing to do with Islam and the
other one the other side wants to say

5960
01:42:05,030 --> 01:42:05,040
other one the other side wants to say
 

5961
01:42:05,040 --> 01:42:07,669
other one the other side wants to say
this is radical Islam

5962
01:42:07,669 --> 01:42:07,679
this is radical Islam
 

5963
01:42:07,679 --> 01:42:09,709
this is radical Islam
right what's in between those is saying

5964
01:42:09,709 --> 01:42:09,719
right what's in between those is saying
 

5965
01:42:09,719 --> 01:42:11,810
right what's in between those is saying
This is complicated and nuanced and we

5966
01:42:11,810 --> 01:42:11,820
This is complicated and nuanced and we
 

5967
01:42:11,820 --> 01:42:13,729
This is complicated and nuanced and we
have to learn more and it probably has

5968
01:42:13,729 --> 01:42:13,739
have to learn more and it probably has
 

5969
01:42:13,739 --> 01:42:14,750
have to learn more and it probably has
something to do with Islam and something

5970
01:42:14,750 --> 01:42:14,760
something to do with Islam and something
 

5971
01:42:14,760 --> 01:42:15,950
something to do with Islam and something
to do with

5972
01:42:15,950 --> 01:42:15,960
to do with
 

5973
01:42:15,960 --> 01:42:17,270
to do with
um the economic circumstances and

5974
01:42:17,270 --> 01:42:17,280
um the economic circumstances and
 

5975
01:42:17,280 --> 01:42:18,050
um the economic circumstances and
something to do with you know

5976
01:42:18,050 --> 01:42:18,060
something to do with you know
 

5977
01:42:18,060 --> 01:42:21,709
something to do with you know
geopolitics so in in a case like that

5978
01:42:21,709 --> 01:42:21,719
geopolitics so in in a case like that
 

5979
01:42:21,719 --> 01:42:23,810
geopolitics so in in a case like that
you actually do get really unnuanced

5980
01:42:23,810 --> 01:42:23,820
you actually do get really unnuanced
 

5981
01:42:23,820 --> 01:42:25,430
you actually do get really unnuanced
when you go to the extremes and all of

5982
01:42:25,430 --> 01:42:25,440
when you go to the extremes and all of
 

5983
01:42:25,440 --> 01:42:26,689
when you go to the extremes and all of
the Nuance which is where all the truth

5984
01:42:26,689 --> 01:42:26,699
the Nuance which is where all the truth
 

5985
01:42:26,699 --> 01:42:28,250
the Nuance which is where all the truth
usually is is going to be in the middle

5986
01:42:28,250 --> 01:42:28,260
usually is is going to be in the middle
 

5987
01:42:28,260 --> 01:42:31,129
usually is is going to be in the middle
so yeah but there is a truth to the fact

5988
01:42:31,129 --> 01:42:31,139
so yeah but there is a truth to the fact
 

5989
01:42:31,139 --> 01:42:32,629
so yeah but there is a truth to the fact
that if you take that Nuance on those

5990
01:42:32,629 --> 01:42:32,639
that if you take that Nuance on those
 

5991
01:42:32,639 --> 01:42:35,990
that if you take that Nuance on those
issues like warn Ukraine covid

5992
01:42:35,990 --> 01:42:36,000
issues like warn Ukraine covid
 

5993
01:42:36,000 --> 01:42:37,550
issues like warn Ukraine covid

Pinker or Jonathan height gets accused

6014
01:42:57,590 --> 01:42:57,600
Pinker or Jonathan height gets accused
 

6015
01:42:57,600 --> 01:42:59,629
Pinker or Jonathan height gets accused

highfalutin you know intellectual world
 

6019
01:43:02,400 --> 01:43:04,669
highfalutin you know intellectual world
and they don't actually have any they

6020
01:43:04,669 --> 01:43:04,679
and they don't actually have any they
 

6021
01:43:04,679 --> 01:43:06,109
and they don't actually have any they
don't actually take a side they don't

actually get their hands dirty and they
 

6025
01:43:08,159 --> 01:43:10,550
actually get their hands dirty and they
can be superior to both sides without

6026
01:43:10,550 --> 01:43:10,560
can be superior to both sides without
 

6027
01:43:10,560 --> 01:43:12,410
can be superior to both sides without
actually taking a stand right so I I see

6028
01:43:12,410 --> 01:43:12,420
actually taking a stand right so I I see
 

6029
01:43:12,420 --> 01:43:13,970
actually taking a stand right so I I see
the argument and I disagree with it

6030
01:43:13,970 --> 01:43:13,980
the argument and I disagree with it
 

6031
01:43:13,980 --> 01:43:14,990
the argument and I disagree with it
because

6032
01:43:14,990 --> 01:43:15,000
because
 

6033
01:43:15,000 --> 01:43:17,930
because
I firmly believe that the hardcore

6034
01:43:17,930 --> 01:43:17,940
I firmly believe that the hardcore
 

6035
01:43:17,940 --> 01:43:20,629
I firmly believe that the hardcore
tribes they think they're taking a stand

6036
01:43:20,629 --> 01:43:20,639
tribes they think they're taking a stand
 

6037
01:43:20,639 --> 01:43:21,709
tribes they think they're taking a stand
and they're out in the streets and

6038
01:43:21,709 --> 01:43:21,719
and they're out in the streets and
 

6039
01:43:21,719 --> 01:43:22,790
and they're out in the streets and
they're pushing for something I think

6040
01:43:22,790 --> 01:43:22,800
they're pushing for something I think
 

6041
01:43:22,800 --> 01:43:23,810
they're pushing for something I think
what they're doing is they're just

6042
01:43:23,810 --> 01:43:23,820
what they're doing is they're just
 

6043
01:43:23,820 --> 01:43:25,370
what they're doing is they're just
driving the whole country downwards and

6044
01:43:25,370 --> 01:43:25,380
driving the whole country downwards and
 

6045
01:43:25,380 --> 01:43:26,870
driving the whole country downwards and
I think they're they're hurting all the

I think they're they're hurting all the
 

6047
01:43:26,880 --> 01:43:28,970
I think they're they're hurting all the
causes they care about and so it's not

6048
01:43:28,970 --> 01:43:28,980
causes they care about and so it's not
 

6049
01:43:28,980 --> 01:43:30,229
causes they care about and so it's not
that it's not that you know it's not

6050
01:43:30,229 --> 01:43:30,239
that it's not that you know it's not
 

6051
01:43:30,239 --> 01:43:31,490
that it's not that you know it's not
that we need everyone to be sitting

6052
01:43:31,490 --> 01:43:31,500
that we need everyone to be sitting
 

6053
01:43:31,500 --> 01:43:33,050
that we need everyone to be sitting
there you know refusing to take aside

6054
01:43:33,050 --> 01:43:33,060
there you know refusing to take aside
 

6055

political discourse mean uh since this
higher philosophical View and then you

6068
01:43:48,470 --> 01:43:48,480
higher philosophical View and then you
 

6069
01:43:48,480 --> 01:43:50,390
higher philosophical View and then you
use the words Progressive to mean the

6070
01:43:50,390 --> 01:43:50,400
use the words Progressive to mean the
 

6071

01:43:58,010 --> 01:43:58,020
liberal games and power games
 

6077
01:43:58,020 --> 01:44:02,390
liberal games and power games
so the power games is is what I call the

6078
01:44:02,390 --> 01:44:02,400
so the power games is is what I call the
 

6079
01:44:02,400 --> 01:44:05,209
so the power games is is what I call the
like basically just the laws of nature

6080
01:44:05,209 --> 01:44:05,219
like basically just the laws of nature
 

6081
01:44:05,219 --> 01:44:06,649
like basically just the laws of nature
as the

6082
01:44:06,649 --> 01:44:06,659
as the
 

6083
01:44:06,659 --> 01:44:08,570
as the
when laws of nature are the laws of the

6084
01:44:08,570 --> 01:44:08,580
when laws of nature are the laws of the
 

6085
01:44:08,580 --> 01:44:10,910
when laws of nature are the laws of the
land that's the power game so animals

6086
01:44:10,910 --> 01:44:10,920
land that's the power game so animals
 

6087
01:44:10,920 --> 01:44:13,850
land that's the power game so animals
watch any David Attenborough special and

6088
01:44:13,850 --> 01:44:13,860
watch any David Attenborough special and
 

6089
01:44:13,860 --> 01:44:15,470
watch any David Attenborough special and
when the little lizard is running away

6090
01:44:15,470 --> 01:44:15,480
when the little lizard is running away
 

6091
01:44:15,480 --> 01:44:18,169
when the little lizard is running away
from the the you know the bigger animal

6092
01:44:18,169 --> 01:44:18,179
from the the you know the bigger animal
 

6093
01:44:18,179 --> 01:44:19,850
from the the you know the bigger animal
or whatever

6094
01:44:19,850 --> 01:44:19,860
or whatever
 

6095
01:44:19,860 --> 01:44:21,470
or whatever
um and I use an example of a bunny and a

6096
01:44:21,470 --> 01:44:21,480
um and I use an example of a bunny and a
 

6097
01:44:21,480 --> 01:44:22,609
um and I use an example of a bunny and a
bear I don't even know if bears eat

6098
01:44:22,609 --> 01:44:22,619
bear I don't even know if bears eat
 

6099
01:44:22,619 --> 01:44:23,810
bear I don't even know if bears eat
bunnies they probably don't but pretend

6100
01:44:23,810 --> 01:44:23,820
bunnies they probably don't but pretend
 

6101
01:44:23,820 --> 01:44:25,490
bunnies they probably don't but pretend
bears eat bunnies right so it's like in

6102
01:44:25,490 --> 01:44:25,500
bears eat bunnies right so it's like in
 

6103
01:44:25,500 --> 01:44:27,530
bears eat bunnies right so it's like in
the power games the bear is chasing the

6104
01:44:27,530 --> 01:44:27,540
the power games the bear is chasing the
 

6105
01:44:27,540 --> 01:44:28,490
the power games the bear is chasing the
bunny

6106
01:44:28,490 --> 01:44:28,500
bunny
 

6107
01:44:28,500 --> 01:44:30,590
bunny
there's no fairness there's no okay well

6108
01:44:30,590 --> 01:44:30,600
there's no fairness there's no okay well
 

6109
01:44:30,600 --> 01:44:31,790
there's no fairness there's no okay well
what's right but you know what what what

6110
01:44:31,790 --> 01:44:31,800
what's right but you know what what what
 

6111
01:44:31,800 --> 01:44:34,189
what's right but you know what what what
what what's legal no no if the bear is

6112
01:44:34,189 --> 01:44:34,199
what what's legal no no if the bear is
 

6113
01:44:34,199 --> 01:44:35,209
what what's legal no no if the bear is
fast enough

6114
01:44:35,209 --> 01:44:35,219
fast enough
 

6115
01:44:35,219 --> 01:44:37,850
fast enough
it can eat the bunny if the bunny is can

6116
01:44:37,850 --> 01:44:37,860
it can eat the bunny if the bunny is can
 

6117
01:44:37,860 --> 01:44:40,129
it can eat the bunny if the bunny is can
get away it can say living in so that's

6118
01:44:40,129 --> 01:44:40,139
get away it can say living in so that's
 

6119
01:44:40,139 --> 01:44:42,830
get away it can say living in so that's
it that's the Only Rule now humans

6120
01:44:42,830 --> 01:44:42,840
it that's the Only Rule now humans
 

6121
01:44:42,840 --> 01:44:44,750
it that's the Only Rule now humans
have spent a lot of time in essentially

6122
01:44:44,750 --> 01:44:44,760
have spent a lot of time in essentially
 

6123
01:44:44,760 --> 01:44:46,129
have spent a lot of time in essentially
that environment so when you have a

6124
01:44:46,129 --> 01:44:46,139
that environment so when you have a
 

6125
01:44:46,139 --> 01:44:48,350
that environment so when you have a
totalitarian dictatorship

6126
01:44:48,350 --> 01:44:48,360
totalitarian dictatorship
 

6127
01:44:48,360 --> 01:44:50,090
totalitarian dictatorship
it's and so what's the rule of the power

6128
01:44:50,090 --> 01:44:50,100
it's and so what's the rule of the power
 

6129
01:44:50,100 --> 01:44:51,830
it's and so what's the rule of the power
games it's everyone can do whatever they

6130
01:44:51,830 --> 01:44:51,840
games it's everyone can do whatever they
 

6131
01:44:51,840 --> 01:44:53,209
games it's everyone can do whatever they
want if they have the power to do so

6132
01:44:53,209 --> 01:44:53,219
want if they have the power to do so
 

6133
01:44:53,219 --> 01:44:55,370
want if they have the power to do so
it's just a game of power so if the

6134
01:44:55,370 --> 01:44:55,380
it's just a game of power so if the
 

6135
01:44:55,380 --> 01:44:56,629
it's just a game of power so if the
bunny gets away the bunny actually has

6136
01:44:56,629 --> 01:44:56,639
bunny gets away the bunny actually has
 

6137
01:44:56,639 --> 01:44:57,770
bunny gets away the bunny actually has
more power than the Bear in that

6138
01:44:57,770 --> 01:44:57,780
more power than the Bear in that
 

6139
01:44:57,780 --> 01:44:59,930
more power than the Bear in that
situation right and likewise the

6140
01:44:59,930 --> 01:44:59,940
situation right and likewise the
 

6141
01:44:59,940 --> 01:45:02,090
situation right and likewise the
totalitarian dictatorship there's no

6142
01:45:02,090 --> 01:45:02,100
totalitarian dictatorship there's no
 

6143
01:45:02,100 --> 01:45:04,189
totalitarian dictatorship there's no
rules that dictator can do whatever they

6144
01:45:04,189 --> 01:45:04,199
rules that dictator can do whatever they
 

6145
01:45:04,199 --> 01:45:05,810
rules that dictator can do whatever they
want they can they can they can torture

6146
01:45:05,810 --> 01:45:05,820
want they can they can they can torture
 

6147
01:45:05,820 --> 01:45:08,209
want they can they can they can torture
they can you know flatten a rebellion

6148
01:45:08,209 --> 01:45:08,219
they can you know flatten a rebellion
 

6149
01:45:08,219 --> 01:45:10,070
they can you know flatten a rebellion
with a lot of murder because they have

6150
01:45:10,070 --> 01:45:10,080
with a lot of murder because they have
 

6151
01:45:10,080 --> 01:45:11,629
with a lot of murder because they have
the power to do so what are you gonna do

6152
01:45:11,629 --> 01:45:11,639
the power to do so what are you gonna do
 

6153
01:45:11,639 --> 01:45:13,609
the power to do so what are you gonna do
right and that's that's kind of the

6154
01:45:13,609 --> 01:45:13,619
right and that's that's kind of the
 

6155
01:45:13,619 --> 01:45:15,109
right and that's that's kind of the
state of nature that's our natural way

6156
01:45:15,109 --> 01:45:15,119
state of nature that's our natural way
 

6157
01:45:15,119 --> 01:45:16,550
state of nature that's our natural way
you know that you know when you look at

6158
01:45:16,550 --> 01:45:16,560
you know that you know when you look at
 

6159
01:45:16,560 --> 01:45:18,470
you know that you know when you look at
the Muff watch a mafia movie

6160
01:45:18,470 --> 01:45:18,480
the Muff watch a mafia movie
 

6161
01:45:18,480 --> 01:45:20,629
the Muff watch a mafia movie
you know there's we do a lot of we have

6162
01:45:20,629 --> 01:45:20,639
you know there's we do a lot of we have
 

6163
01:45:20,639 --> 01:45:23,689
you know there's we do a lot of we have
we have it in us we all have we all can

6164
01:45:23,689 --> 01:45:23,699
we have it in us we all have we all can
 

6165
01:45:23,699 --> 01:45:26,930
we have it in us we all have we all can
snap into power games mode when uh it

6166
01:45:26,930 --> 01:45:26,940
snap into power games mode when uh it
 

6167
01:45:26,940 --> 01:45:29,450
snap into power games mode when uh it
becomes all about you know just just

6168
01:45:29,450 --> 01:45:29,460
becomes all about you know just just
 

6169
01:45:29,460 --> 01:45:31,870
becomes all about you know just just
actual raw power now the liberal games

6170
01:45:31,870 --> 01:45:31,880
actual raw power now the liberal games
 

6171
01:45:31,880 --> 01:45:34,550
actual raw power now the liberal games
is is you know something that's

6172
01:45:34,550 --> 01:45:34,560
is is you know something that's
 

6173
01:45:34,560 --> 01:45:36,290
is is you know something that's
Civilizations for thousands of years

6174
01:45:36,290 --> 01:45:36,300
Civilizations for thousands of years
 

6175
01:45:36,300 --> 01:45:38,090
Civilizations for thousands of years
have been working on it's not invented

6176
01:45:38,090 --> 01:45:38,100
have been working on it's not invented
 

6177
01:45:38,100 --> 01:45:40,790
have been working on it's not invented
by America or modern times but America's

6178
01:45:40,790 --> 01:45:40,800
by America or modern times but America's
 

6179
01:45:40,800 --> 01:45:42,890
by America or modern times but America's
kind of was like the latest crack at it

6180
01:45:42,890 --> 01:45:42,900
kind of was like the latest crack at it
 

6181
01:45:42,900 --> 01:45:45,169
kind of was like the latest crack at it
yet which is this idea instead of

6182
01:45:45,169 --> 01:45:45,179
yet which is this idea instead of
 

6183
01:45:45,179 --> 01:45:46,910
yet which is this idea instead of
everyone can do what they want if they

6184
01:45:46,910 --> 01:45:46,920
everyone can do what they want if they
 

6185
01:45:46,920 --> 01:45:48,290
everyone can do what they want if they
have the power to do so it's everyone

6186
01:45:48,290 --> 01:45:48,300
have the power to do so it's everyone
 

6187
01:45:48,300 --> 01:45:49,729
have the power to do so it's everyone
can do what they want as long as it

6188
01:45:49,729 --> 01:45:49,739
can do what they want as long as it
 

6189
01:45:49,739 --> 01:45:51,410
can do what they want as long as it
doesn't harm anyone else now that's

6190
01:45:51,410 --> 01:45:51,420
doesn't harm anyone else now that's
 

6191
01:45:51,420 --> 01:45:52,609
doesn't harm anyone else now that's
really complicated how do you define

6192
01:45:52,609 --> 01:45:52,619
really complicated how do you define
 

6193
01:45:52,619 --> 01:45:54,530
really complicated how do you define
harm and and the idea is that everyone

6194
01:45:54,530 --> 01:45:54,540
harm and and the idea is that everyone
 

6195
01:45:54,540 --> 01:45:57,109
harm and and the idea is that everyone
has their a list of rights which are

6196
01:45:57,109 --> 01:45:57,119
has their a list of rights which are
 

6197
01:45:57,119 --> 01:45:58,729
has their a list of rights which are
protected by the government

6198
01:45:58,729 --> 01:45:58,739
protected by the government
 

6199
01:45:58,739 --> 01:46:01,070
protected by the government
and then they have they're inalienable

6200
01:46:01,070 --> 01:46:01,080
and then they have they're inalienable
 

6201
01:46:01,080 --> 01:46:02,990
and then they have they're inalienable
rights and they're they're protected you

6202
01:46:02,990 --> 01:46:03,000
rights and they're they're protected you
 

6203
01:46:03,000 --> 01:46:05,510
rights and they're they're protected you
know those are protected uh uh Again by

6204
01:46:05,510 --> 01:46:05,520
know those are protected uh uh Again by
 

6205
01:46:05,520 --> 01:46:07,970
know those are protected uh uh Again by
you know um from from an invasion by

6206
01:46:07,970 --> 01:46:07,980
you know um from from an invasion by
 

6207
01:46:07,980 --> 01:46:09,590
you know um from from an invasion by
other people and so you have this kind

6208
01:46:09,590 --> 01:46:09,600
other people and so you have this kind
 

6209
01:46:09,600 --> 01:46:12,290
other people and so you have this kind
of fragile balance and so the idea with

6210
01:46:12,290 --> 01:46:12,300
of fragile balance and so the idea with
 

6211
01:46:12,300 --> 01:46:14,570
of fragile balance and so the idea with
the liberal games is you that there are

6212
01:46:14,570 --> 01:46:14,580
the liberal games is you that there are
 

6213
01:46:14,580 --> 01:46:16,850
the liberal games is you that there are
laws but it's not totalitarian they will

6214
01:46:16,850 --> 01:46:16,860
laws but it's not totalitarian they will
 

6215
01:46:16,860 --> 01:46:19,970
laws but it's not totalitarian they will
build very clear strict laws kind of

6216
01:46:19,970 --> 01:46:19,980
build very clear strict laws kind of
 

6217
01:46:19,980 --> 01:46:21,530
build very clear strict laws kind of
around the edges of what you can and

6218
01:46:21,530 --> 01:46:21,540
around the edges of what you can and
 

6219
01:46:21,540 --> 01:46:22,729
around the edges of what you can and
can't do and then everything else

6220
01:46:22,729 --> 01:46:22,739
can't do and then everything else
 

6221
01:46:22,739 --> 01:46:25,669
can't do and then everything else
Freedom so unlike a totalitarian

6222
01:46:25,669 --> 01:46:25,679
Freedom so unlike a totalitarian
 

6223
01:46:25,679 --> 01:46:27,350
Freedom so unlike a totalitarian
dictatorship actually it's it's very

6224
01:46:27,350 --> 01:46:27,360
dictatorship actually it's it's very
 

6225
01:46:27,360 --> 01:46:29,510
dictatorship actually it's it's very
loose there's a lot of things can happen

6226
01:46:29,510 --> 01:46:29,520
loose there's a lot of things can happen
 

6227
01:46:29,520 --> 01:46:31,550
loose there's a lot of things can happen
and it's kind of up to the people but

6228
01:46:31,550 --> 01:46:31,560
and it's kind of up to the people but
 

6229
01:46:31,560 --> 01:46:32,990
and it's kind of up to the people but
there are still laws that protect the

6230
01:46:32,990 --> 01:46:33,000
there are still laws that protect the
 

6231
01:46:33,000 --> 01:46:34,430
there are still laws that protect the
very basic and alienable rights and

6232
01:46:34,430 --> 01:46:34,440
very basic and alienable rights and
 

6233
01:46:34,440 --> 01:46:35,810
very basic and alienable rights and
stuff like that so it's this much looser

6234
01:46:35,810 --> 01:46:35,820
stuff like that so it's this much looser
 

6235
01:46:35,820 --> 01:46:38,629
stuff like that so it's this much looser
thing now the vulnerability there is

6236
01:46:38,629 --> 01:46:38,639
thing now the vulnerability there is
 

6237
01:46:38,639 --> 01:46:39,350
thing now the vulnerability there is
that

6238
01:46:39,350 --> 01:46:39,360
that
 

6239
01:46:39,360 --> 01:46:42,050
that
it so so the

6240
01:46:42,050 --> 01:46:42,060
it so so the
 

6241
01:46:42,060 --> 01:46:44,450
it so so the
the benefits of it are obvious right

6242
01:46:44,450 --> 01:46:44,460
the benefits of it are obvious right
 

6243
01:46:44,460 --> 01:46:46,189
the benefits of it are obvious right
freedom is great it seems like it's the

6244
01:46:46,189 --> 01:46:46,199
freedom is great it seems like it's the
 

6245
01:46:46,199 --> 01:46:47,510
freedom is great it seems like it's the
most Fair they you know that that

6246
01:46:47,510 --> 01:46:47,520
most Fair they you know that that
 

6247
01:46:47,520 --> 01:46:49,910
most Fair they you know that that
equality of opportunity seemed like the

6248
01:46:49,910 --> 01:46:49,920
equality of opportunity seemed like the
 

6249
01:46:49,920 --> 01:46:52,970
equality of opportunity seemed like the
most fair thing and

6250
01:46:52,970 --> 01:46:52,980
most fair thing and
 

6251
01:46:52,980 --> 01:46:55,430
most fair thing and
um and you know equality before the law

6252
01:46:55,430 --> 01:46:55,440
um and you know equality before the law
 

6253
01:46:55,440 --> 01:46:57,229
um and you know equality before the law
you know due process and all of this

6254
01:46:57,229 --> 01:46:57,239
you know due process and all of this
 

6255
01:46:57,239 --> 01:46:59,810
you know due process and all of this
stuff so it seems fair to the founders

6256
01:46:59,810 --> 01:46:59,820
stuff so it seems fair to the founders
 

6257
01:46:59,820 --> 01:47:01,129
stuff so it seems fair to the founders
of the Us and other Enlightenment

6258
01:47:01,129 --> 01:47:01,139
of the Us and other Enlightenment
 

6259
01:47:01,139 --> 01:47:03,169
of the Us and other Enlightenment
thinkers and it also is a great way to

6260
01:47:03,169 --> 01:47:03,179
thinkers and it also is a great way to
 

6261
01:47:03,179 --> 01:47:05,510
thinkers and it also is a great way to
manifest productivity right you know you

6262
01:47:05,510 --> 01:47:05,520
manifest productivity right you know you
 

6263
01:47:05,520 --> 01:47:08,149
manifest productivity right you know you
have um you have Adam Smith saying it's

6264
01:47:08,149 --> 01:47:08,159
have um you have Adam Smith saying it's
 

6265
01:47:08,159 --> 01:47:09,709
have um you have Adam Smith saying it's
not from the benevolence of the butcher

6266
01:47:09,709 --> 01:47:09,719
not from the benevolence of the butcher
 

6267
01:47:09,719 --> 01:47:11,030
not from the benevolence of the butcher
or the baker that we get our dinner but

6268
01:47:11,030 --> 01:47:11,040
or the baker that we get our dinner but
 

6269
01:47:11,040 --> 01:47:12,470
or the baker that we get our dinner but
from their from their own self-interest

6270
01:47:12,470 --> 01:47:12,480
from their from their own self-interest
 

6271
01:47:12,480 --> 01:47:13,910
from their from their own self-interest
so you have you can harness kind of

6272
01:47:13,910 --> 01:47:13,920
so you have you can harness kind of
 

6273
01:47:13,920 --> 01:47:17,330
so you have you can harness kind of
selfishness for for progress but

6274
01:47:17,330 --> 01:47:17,340
selfishness for for progress but
 

6275
01:47:17,340 --> 01:47:18,950
selfishness for for progress but
um it has a vulnerability which is that

6276
01:47:18,950 --> 01:47:18,960
um it has a vulnerability which is that
 

6277
01:47:18,960 --> 01:47:20,570
um it has a vulnerability which is that
because the laws it's like the

6278
01:47:20,570 --> 01:47:20,580
because the laws it's like the
 

6279
01:47:20,580 --> 01:47:23,870
because the laws it's like the
totalitarian laws they don't have an

6280
01:47:23,870 --> 01:47:23,880
totalitarian laws they don't have an
 

6281
01:47:23,880 --> 01:47:25,790
totalitarian laws they don't have an
excessive loss for no reason they want

6282
01:47:25,790 --> 01:47:25,800
excessive loss for no reason they want
 

6283
01:47:25,800 --> 01:47:27,649
excessive loss for no reason they want
to control everything and the US you

6284
01:47:27,649 --> 01:47:27,659
to control everything and the US you
 

6285
01:47:27,659 --> 01:47:28,790
to control everything and the US you
know in the US we say they're not going

6286
01:47:28,790 --> 01:47:28,800
know in the US we say they're not going
 

6287
01:47:28,800 --> 01:47:31,129
know in the US we say they're not going
to do that and so the the second it's

6288
01:47:31,129 --> 01:47:31,139
to do that and so the the second it's
 

6289
01:47:31,139 --> 01:47:32,510
to do that and so the the second it's
almost two puzzle pieces you have the

6290
01:47:32,510 --> 01:47:32,520
almost two puzzle pieces you have the
 

6291
01:47:32,520 --> 01:47:35,090
almost two puzzle pieces you have the
laws and then you've got a liberal

6292
01:47:35,090 --> 01:47:35,100
laws and then you've got a liberal
 

6293
01:47:35,100 --> 01:47:36,770
laws and then you've got a liberal
culture liberal laws have to be married

6294
01:47:36,770 --> 01:47:36,780
culture liberal laws have to be married
 

6295
01:47:36,780 --> 01:47:39,530
culture liberal laws have to be married
to Liberal culture kind of a defense of

6296
01:47:39,530 --> 01:47:39,540
to Liberal culture kind of a defense of
 

6297
01:47:39,540 --> 01:47:42,290
to Liberal culture kind of a defense of
liberal Spirit in order to truly have

6298
01:47:42,290 --> 01:47:42,300
liberal Spirit in order to truly have
 

6299
01:47:42,300 --> 01:47:44,510
liberal Spirit in order to truly have
the liberal games going on and so that's

6300
01:47:44,510 --> 01:47:44,520
the liberal games going on and so that's
 

6301
01:47:44,520 --> 01:47:47,030
the liberal games going on and so that's
vulnerable because Free Speech you can

6302
01:47:47,030 --> 01:47:47,040
vulnerable because Free Speech you can
 

6303
01:47:47,040 --> 01:47:49,129
vulnerable because Free Speech you can
have the First Amendment that's the the

6304
01:47:49,129 --> 01:47:49,139
have the First Amendment that's the the
 

6305
01:47:49,139 --> 01:47:51,649
have the First Amendment that's the the
laws part but if if you're in a culture

6306
01:47:51,649 --> 01:47:51,659
laws part but if if you're in a culture
 

6307
01:47:51,659 --> 01:47:55,729
laws part but if if you're in a culture
where anyone who you know speaks out uh

6308
01:47:55,729 --> 01:47:55,739
where anyone who you know speaks out uh
 

6309
01:47:55,739 --> 01:47:57,890
where anyone who you know speaks out uh
against Orthodoxy is going to be shunned

6310
01:47:57,890 --> 01:47:57,900
against Orthodoxy is going to be shunned
 

6311
01:47:57,900 --> 01:47:59,870
against Orthodoxy is going to be shunned
from the community well you're lacking

6312
01:47:59,870 --> 01:47:59,880
from the community well you're lacking
 

6313
01:47:59,880 --> 01:48:01,010
from the community well you're lacking
the second piece of the puzzle there

6314
01:48:01,010 --> 01:48:01,020
the second piece of the puzzle there
 

6315
01:48:01,020 --> 01:48:02,930
the second piece of the puzzle there
you're lacking liberal culture and so

6316
01:48:02,930 --> 01:48:02,940
you're lacking liberal culture and so
 

6317
01:48:02,940 --> 01:48:05,450
you're lacking liberal culture and so
therefore you um you might as well be in

6318
01:48:05,450 --> 01:48:05,460
therefore you um you might as well be in
 

6319
01:48:05,460 --> 01:48:06,950
therefore you um you might as well be in
it you might as well not even have the

6320
01:48:06,950 --> 01:48:06,960
it you might as well not even have the
 

6321
01:48:06,960 --> 01:48:08,689
it you might as well not even have the
First Amendment and there's a lot of

6322
01:48:08,689 --> 01:48:08,699
First Amendment and there's a lot of
 

6323
01:48:08,699 --> 01:48:10,430
First Amendment and there's a lot of
examples like that where the culture has

6324
01:48:10,430 --> 01:48:10,440
examples like that where the culture has
 

6325
01:48:10,440 --> 01:48:12,410
examples like that where the culture has
to do its part for the true liberal

6326
01:48:12,410 --> 01:48:12,420
to do its part for the true liberal
 

6327
01:48:12,420 --> 01:48:14,270
to do its part for the true liberal
games to be enjoyed

6328
01:48:14,270 --> 01:48:14,280
games to be enjoyed
 

6329
01:48:14,280 --> 01:48:15,890
games to be enjoyed
so it's just much more complicated much

6330
01:48:15,890 --> 01:48:15,900
so it's just much more complicated much
 

6331
01:48:15,900 --> 01:48:18,050
so it's just much more complicated much
more nuanced than the power games it's

6332
01:48:18,050 --> 01:48:18,060
more nuanced than the power games it's
 

6333
01:48:18,060 --> 01:48:21,350
more nuanced than the power games it's
kind of it's kind of a set of basic laws

6334
01:48:21,350 --> 01:48:21,360
kind of it's kind of a set of basic laws
 

6335
01:48:21,360 --> 01:48:23,090
kind of it's kind of a set of basic laws
that then

6336
01:48:23,090 --> 01:48:23,100
that then
 

6337
01:48:23,100 --> 01:48:25,550
that then
are coupled with a basic Spirit to

6338
01:48:25,550 --> 01:48:25,560
are coupled with a basic Spirit to
 

6339
01:48:25,560 --> 01:48:27,590
are coupled with a basic Spirit to
create this

6340
01:48:27,590 --> 01:48:27,600
create this
 

6341
01:48:27,600 --> 01:48:30,590
create this
very awesome in human environment that's

6342
01:48:30,590 --> 01:48:30,600
very awesome in human environment that's
 

6343
01:48:30,600 --> 01:48:32,270
very awesome in human environment that's
also very vulnerable

6344
01:48:32,270 --> 01:48:32,280
also very vulnerable
 

6345
01:48:32,280 --> 01:48:33,890
also very vulnerable
so what do you mean the culture has to

6346
01:48:33,890 --> 01:48:33,900
so what do you mean the culture has to
 

6347
01:48:33,900 --> 01:48:35,750
so what do you mean the culture has to
play along so for something like a

6348
01:48:35,750 --> 01:48:35,760
play along so for something like a
 

6349
01:48:35,760 --> 01:48:38,390
play along so for something like a
freedom of speech to work

6350
01:48:38,390 --> 01:48:38,400
freedom of speech to work
 

6351
01:48:38,400 --> 01:48:40,790
freedom of speech to work
there has to be a basic what decency

6352

6567
01:52:43,080 --> 01:52:45,530
than Reagan I don't think so I think
he's a lot of actual policy yeah yeah so

01:52:45,530 --> 01:52:45,540
he's a lot of actual policy yeah yeah so
 

6569
01:52:45,540 --> 01:52:47,030
he's a lot of actual policy yeah yeah so
it's so we're using this again it's just

6570
01:52:47,030 --> 01:52:47,040
it's so we're using this again it's just
 

6571
01:52:47,040 --> 01:52:48,290
it's so we're using this again it's just
like you're calling yourself Centrist

01:56:50,629 --> 01:56:50,639
the last year of his presidency and the
 

6821
01:56:50,639 --> 01:56:51,709
the last year of his presidency and the
people should choose I don't think we

6822
01:56:51,709 --> 01:56:51,719
people should choose I don't think we
 

6823
01:56:51,719 --> 01:56:53,930
people should choose I don't think we
should set a new precedent where you the

6824
01:56:53,930 --> 01:56:53,940
should set a new precedent where you the
 

6825
01:56:53,940 --> 01:56:56,149
should set a new precedent where you the
president can't nominate people uh

6826
01:56:56,149 --> 01:56:56,159
president can't nominate people uh
 

6827
01:56:56,159 --> 01:56:57,830
president can't nominate people uh
nominate a Supreme Court Justice in the

6828
01:56:57,830 --> 01:56:57,840
nominate a Supreme Court Justice in the
 

6829
01:56:57,840 --> 01:56:59,629
nominate a Supreme Court Justice in the
last year so they they passed the throw

6830
01:56:59,629 --> 01:56:59,639
last year so they they passed the throw
 

6831
01:56:59,639 --> 01:57:01,729
last year so they they passed the throw
and it ends up being Gorsuch

6832
01:57:01,729 --> 01:57:01,739
and it ends up being Gorsuch
 

6833
01:57:01,739 --> 01:57:04,250
and it ends up being Gorsuch
um and so they they lose that seat now

6834
01:57:04,250 --> 01:57:04,260
um and so they they lose that seat now
 

6835
01:57:04,260 --> 01:57:05,930
um and so they they lose that seat now
three years later it's Trump's last year

6836
01:57:05,930 --> 01:57:05,940
three years later it's Trump's last year
 

6837
01:57:05,940 --> 01:57:08,149
three years later it's Trump's last year
and it's another election year

6838
01:57:08,149 --> 01:57:08,159
and it's another election year
 

6839
01:57:08,159 --> 01:57:11,810
and it's another election year
and Ginsburg dies and what did they say

6840
01:57:11,810 --> 01:57:11,820
and Ginsburg dies and what did they say
 

6841
01:57:11,820 --> 01:57:12,830
and Ginsburg dies and what did they say
they say oh let's keep our president

6842
01:57:12,830 --> 01:57:12,840
they say oh let's keep our president
 

6843
01:57:12,840 --> 01:57:14,570
they say oh let's keep our president
they said no oh actually we changed our

6844
01:57:14,570 --> 01:57:14,580
they said no oh actually we changed our
 

6845
01:57:14,580 --> 01:57:17,149
they said no oh actually we changed our
mind we're going to nominate Amy Barrett

6846
01:57:17,149 --> 01:57:17,159
mind we're going to nominate Amy Barrett
 

6847
01:57:17,159 --> 01:57:19,250
mind we're going to nominate Amy Barrett
so to me that is classic power games

6848
01:57:19,250 --> 01:57:19,260
so to me that is classic power games
 

6849
01:57:19,260 --> 01:57:20,689
so to me that is classic power games
right that there there's there's no

6850
01:57:20,689 --> 01:57:20,699
right that there there's there's no
 

6851
01:57:20,699 --> 01:57:22,010
right that there there's there's no
actual rule in what you're doing is they

6852
01:57:22,010 --> 01:57:22,020
actual rule in what you're doing is they
 

6853
01:57:22,020 --> 01:57:23,570
actual rule in what you're doing is they
had they did technically have the power

6854
01:57:23,570 --> 01:57:23,580
had they did technically have the power
 

6855
01:57:23,580 --> 01:57:25,070
had they did technically have the power
to block the nomination then and then

6856
01:57:25,070 --> 01:57:25,080
to block the nomination then and then
 

6857
01:57:25,080 --> 01:57:26,149
to block the nomination then and then
they technically had the power to put

6858
01:57:26,149 --> 01:57:26,159
they technically had the power to put
 

6859
01:57:26,159 --> 01:57:27,229
they technically had the power to put
someone and they and they're pretending

6860
01:57:27,229 --> 01:57:27,239
someone and they and they're pretending
 

6861
01:57:27,239 --> 01:57:28,790
someone and they and they're pretending
there's some principle to it but they're

6862
01:57:28,790 --> 01:57:28,800
there's some principle to it but they're
 

6863
01:57:28,800 --> 01:57:31,070
there's some principle to it but they're
just extra they're going for the a

6864
01:57:31,070 --> 01:57:31,080
just extra they're going for the a
 

6865
01:57:31,080 --> 01:57:33,290
just extra they're going for the a
short-term Edge at the expense of what

6866
01:57:33,290 --> 01:57:33,300
short-term Edge at the expense of what
 

6867
01:57:33,300 --> 01:57:35,810
short-term Edge at the expense of what
is like the workings of the system in

6868
01:57:35,810 --> 01:57:35,820
is like the workings of the system in
 

6869
01:57:35,820 --> 01:57:37,010
is like the workings of the system in
the long run and then what do the

6870
01:57:37,010 --> 01:57:37,020
the long run and then what do the
 

6871
01:57:37,020 --> 01:57:38,450
the long run and then what do the
Democrats have to do in that situation

6872
01:57:38,450 --> 01:57:38,460
Democrats have to do in that situation
 

6873
01:57:38,460 --> 01:57:40,189
Democrats have to do in that situation
because both parties have been doing

6874
01:57:40,189 --> 01:57:40,199
because both parties have been doing
 

6875
01:57:40,199 --> 01:57:42,290
because both parties have been doing
this is they either can lose now all the

6876
01:57:42,290 --> 01:57:42,300
this is they either can lose now all the
 

6877
01:57:42,300 --> 01:57:43,310
this is they either can lose now all the
time or they start playing the power

6878
01:57:43,310 --> 01:57:43,320
time or they start playing the power
 

6879
01:57:43,320 --> 01:57:45,410
time or they start playing the power
games too and now you have a prisoner's

6880
01:57:45,410 --> 01:57:45,420
games too and now you have a prisoner's
 

6881
01:57:45,420 --> 01:57:47,570
games too and now you have a prisoner's
dilemma where it's like both are end up

6882
01:57:47,570 --> 01:57:47,580
dilemma where it's like both are end up
 

6883
01:57:47,580 --> 01:57:48,770
dilemma where it's like both are end up
doing this thing because and then

6884
01:57:48,770 --> 01:57:48,780
doing this thing because and then
 

6885
01:57:48,780 --> 01:57:51,229
doing this thing because and then
everyone ends up worse off the debt

6886
01:57:51,229 --> 01:57:51,239
everyone ends up worse off the debt
 

6887
01:57:51,239 --> 01:57:53,149
everyone ends up worse off the debt
ceiling All these power plays that are

6888
01:57:53,149 --> 01:57:53,159
ceiling All these power plays that are
 

6889
01:57:53,159 --> 01:57:54,589
ceiling All these power plays that are
being made with these these holding the

6890
01:57:54,589 --> 01:57:54,599
being made with these these holding the
 

6891
01:57:54,599 --> 01:57:56,870
being made with these these holding the
country hostage this is power games and

6892
01:57:56,870 --> 01:57:56,880
country hostage this is power games and
 

6893
01:57:56,880 --> 01:57:58,189
country hostage this is power games and
to me that's what Goldwater was doing in

6894
01:57:58,189 --> 01:57:58,199
to me that's what Goldwater was doing in
 

6895
01:57:58,199 --> 01:57:59,810
to me that's what Goldwater was doing in
the 60s but it was a healthier time in a

6896
01:57:59,810 --> 01:57:59,820
the 60s but it was a healthier time in a
 

6897
01:57:59,820 --> 01:58:02,089
the 60s but it was a healthier time in a
way because there was this plurality

6898
01:58:02,089 --> 01:58:02,099
way because there was this plurality
 

6899
01:58:02,099 --> 01:58:04,370
way because there was this plurality
within the parties reduced some of the

6900
01:58:04,370 --> 01:58:04,380
within the parties reduced some of the
 

6901
01:58:04,380 --> 01:58:06,470
within the parties reduced some of the
national tribalism and that there wasn't

6902
01:58:06,470 --> 01:58:06,480
national tribalism and that there wasn't
 

6903
01:58:06,480 --> 01:58:08,149
national tribalism and that there wasn't
as much of an appeal to that but today

6904
01:58:08,149 --> 01:58:08,159
as much of an appeal to that but today
 

6905
01:58:08,159 --> 01:58:09,589
as much of an appeal to that but today
it's just like do whatever you have to

6906
01:58:09,589 --> 01:58:09,599
it's just like do whatever you have to
 

6907
01:58:09,599 --> 01:58:11,750
it's just like do whatever you have to
do to beat the enemies and so I'm seeing

6908
01:58:11,750 --> 01:58:11,760
do to beat the enemies and so I'm seeing
 

6909
01:58:11,760 --> 01:58:14,270
do to beat the enemies and so I'm seeing
a rise in power games and I talk about

6910
01:58:14,270 --> 01:58:14,280
a rise in power games and I talk about
 

6911
01:58:14,280 --> 01:58:15,649
a rise in power games and I talk about
the Republicans because they did a lot

6912
01:58:15,649 --> 01:58:15,659
the Republicans because they did a lot
 

6913
01:58:15,659 --> 01:58:16,729
the Republicans because they did a lot
of these things first they have been a

6914
01:58:16,729 --> 01:58:16,739
of these things first they have been a
 

6915
01:58:16,739 --> 01:58:18,229
of these things first they have been a
little bit more Regis but both parties

6916
01:58:18,229 --> 01:58:18,239
little bit more Regis but both parties
 

6917
01:58:18,239 --> 01:58:19,970
little bit more Regis but both parties
have been doing it over the last 20 30

6918
01:58:19,970 --> 01:58:19,980
have been doing it over the last 20 30
 

6919
01:58:19,980 --> 01:58:22,669
have been doing it over the last 20 30
years can you place uh blame or maybe

6920
01:58:22,669 --> 01:58:22,679
years can you place uh blame or maybe
 

6921
01:58:22,679 --> 01:58:26,330
years can you place uh blame or maybe
there's a different term for it at uh

6922
01:58:26,330 --> 01:58:26,340
there's a different term for it at uh
 

6923
01:58:26,340 --> 01:58:29,209
there's a different term for it at uh
the subsystems of this so is it the

6924
01:58:29,209 --> 01:58:29,219
the subsystems of this so is it the
 

6925
01:58:29,219 --> 01:58:31,609
the subsystems of this so is it the
media is it the politicians like in the

6926
01:58:31,609 --> 01:58:31,619
media is it the politicians like in the
 

6927
01:58:31,619 --> 01:58:34,970
media is it the politicians like in the
senate in Congress is it Trump so the

6928
01:58:34,970 --> 01:58:34,980
senate in Congress is it Trump so the
 

6929
01:58:34,980 --> 01:58:37,550
senate in Congress is it Trump so the
leadership is it

6930
01:58:37,550 --> 01:58:37,560
leadership is it
 

6931
01:58:37,560 --> 01:58:39,950
leadership is it
um or maybe it's us

6932
01:58:39,950 --> 01:58:39,960
um or maybe it's us
 

6933
01:58:39,960 --> 01:58:42,830
um or maybe it's us
human beings uh maybe social media

6934
01:58:42,830 --> 01:58:42,840
human beings uh maybe social media
 

6935
01:58:42,840 --> 01:58:45,350
human beings uh maybe social media
versus mainstream media is there a sense

6936
01:58:45,350 --> 01:58:45,360
versus mainstream media is there a sense
 

6937
01:58:45,360 --> 01:58:47,750
versus mainstream media is there a sense
of where what is the cause of what is

6938
01:58:47,750 --> 01:58:47,760
of where what is the cause of what is
 

6939
01:58:47,760 --> 01:58:49,310
of where what is the cause of what is
the symptom it's very complex so Ezra

6940
01:58:49,310 --> 01:58:49,320
the symptom it's very complex so Ezra
 

6941
01:58:49,320 --> 01:58:50,510
the symptom it's very complex so Ezra
client's a great book while we're

6942
01:58:50,510 --> 01:58:50,520
client's a great book while we're
 

6943
01:58:50,520 --> 01:58:52,070
client's a great book while we're
polarized where he talks about a lot of

6944
01:58:52,070 --> 01:58:52,080
polarized where he talks about a lot of
 

6945
01:58:52,080 --> 01:58:53,870
polarized where he talks about a lot of
this and there's there's some of these

6946
01:58:53,870 --> 01:58:53,880
this and there's there's some of these
 

6947
01:58:53,880 --> 01:58:55,790
this and there's there's some of these
are you know it's really no one's fault

6948
01:58:55,790 --> 01:58:55,800
are you know it's really no one's fault
 

6949
01:58:55,800 --> 01:58:58,070
are you know it's really no one's fault
first of all it's the environment has

6950
01:58:58,070 --> 01:58:58,080
first of all it's the environment has
 

6951
01:58:58,080 --> 01:58:59,390
first of all it's the environment has
changed in a bunch of ways you just

6952
01:58:59,390 --> 01:58:59,400
changed in a bunch of ways you just
 

6953
01:58:59,400 --> 01:59:01,070
changed in a bunch of ways you just
mentioned and what happens when you take

6954
01:59:01,070 --> 01:59:01,080
mentioned and what happens when you take
 

6955
01:59:01,080 --> 01:59:02,450
mentioned and what happens when you take
human nature which is a constant and you

6956
01:59:02,450 --> 01:59:02,460
human nature which is a constant and you
 

6957
01:59:02,460 --> 01:59:04,070
human nature which is a constant and you
put it into an environment

6958
01:59:04,070 --> 01:59:04,080
put it into an environment
 

6959
01:59:04,080 --> 01:59:06,470
put it into an environment
Behavior comes out the environment is

6960
01:59:06,470 --> 01:59:06,480
Behavior comes out the environment is
 

6961
01:59:06,480 --> 01:59:07,669
Behavior comes out the environment is
the independent variable when that

6962
01:59:07,669 --> 01:59:07,679
the independent variable when that
 

6963
01:59:07,679 --> 01:59:09,649
the independent variable when that
changes the dependent variable the

6964
01:59:09,649 --> 01:59:09,659
changes the dependent variable the
 

6965
01:59:09,659 --> 01:59:11,930
changes the dependent variable the
behavior changes with it right and so

6966
01:59:11,930 --> 01:59:11,940
behavior changes with it right and so
 

6967
01:59:11,940 --> 01:59:13,430
behavior changes with it right and so
the environment has changed in a lot of

6968
01:59:13,430 --> 01:59:13,440
the environment has changed in a lot of
 

6969
01:59:13,440 --> 01:59:16,729
the environment has changed in a lot of
ways so one major one is

6970
01:59:16,729 --> 01:59:16,739
ways so one major one is
 

6971
01:59:16,739 --> 01:59:20,390
ways so one major one is
it used to for a long time actually the

6972
01:59:20,390 --> 01:59:20,400
it used to for a long time actually the
 

6973
01:59:20,400 --> 01:59:21,950
it used to for a long time actually the
the the the first there was the

6974
01:59:21,950 --> 01:59:21,960
the the the first there was the
 

6975
01:59:21,960 --> 01:59:23,689
the the the first there was the
Republicans and then the Democrats just

6976
01:59:23,689 --> 01:59:23,699
Republicans and then the Democrats just
 

6977
01:59:23,699 --> 01:59:26,030
Republicans and then the Democrats just
had a Stranglehold on Senate on Congress

6978
01:59:26,030 --> 01:59:26,040
had a Stranglehold on Senate on Congress
 

6979
01:59:26,040 --> 01:59:27,950
had a Stranglehold on Senate on Congress
there was no it was not even competitive

6980
01:59:27,950 --> 01:59:27,960
there was no it was not even competitive
 

6981
01:59:27,960 --> 01:59:30,649
there was no it was not even competitive
the Democrats for 40 years had the

6982
01:59:30,649 --> 01:59:30,659
the Democrats for 40 years had the
 

6983
01:59:30,659 --> 01:59:31,729
the Democrats for 40 years had the
majority

6984
01:59:31,729 --> 01:59:31,739
majority
 

6985
01:59:31,739 --> 01:59:34,010
majority
and so therefore it actually isn't a

6986
01:59:34,010 --> 01:59:34,020
and so therefore it actually isn't a
 

6987
01:59:34,020 --> 01:59:36,950
and so therefore it actually isn't a
decent environment to compromise it

6988
01:59:36,950 --> 01:59:36,960
decent environment to compromise it
 

6989
01:59:36,960 --> 01:59:39,050
decent environment to compromise it
because now we can both you know what

6990
01:59:39,050 --> 01:59:39,060
because now we can both you know what
 

6991
01:59:39,060 --> 01:59:40,310
because now we can both you know what
you want is Congress people thinking

6992
01:59:40,310 --> 01:59:40,320
you want is Congress people thinking
 

6993
01:59:40,320 --> 01:59:42,229
you want is Congress people thinking
about their home district and and you

6994
01:59:42,229 --> 01:59:42,239
about their home district and and you
 

6995
01:59:42,239 --> 01:59:44,570
about their home district and and you
know voting yes on a national policy

6996
01:59:44,570 --> 01:59:44,580
know voting yes on a national policy
 

6997
01:59:44,580 --> 01:59:45,530
know voting yes on a national policy
because we're going to get a good deal

6998
01:59:45,530 --> 01:59:45,540
because we're going to get a good deal
 

6999
01:59:45,540 --> 01:59:46,669
because we're going to get a good deal
on it back at home that's actually

7000
01:59:46,669 --> 01:59:46,679
on it back at home that's actually
 

7001
01:59:46,679 --> 01:59:48,830
on it back at home that's actually
healthy as opposed to voting and

7002
01:59:48,830 --> 01:59:48,840
healthy as opposed to voting and
 

7003
01:59:48,840 --> 01:59:52,010
healthy as opposed to voting and
lockstep together because this is what

7004
01:59:52,010 --> 01:59:52,020
lockstep together because this is what
 

7005
01:59:52,020 --> 01:59:54,350
lockstep together because this is what
the red party is doing regardless of

7006
01:59:54,350 --> 01:59:54,360
the red party is doing regardless of
 

7007
01:59:54,360 --> 01:59:55,729
the red party is doing regardless of
what's good for my home District you

7008
01:59:55,729 --> 01:59:55,739
what's good for my home District you
 

7009
01:59:55,739 --> 01:59:57,649
what's good for my home District you
know an example is Obamacare you know

7010
01:59:57,649 --> 01:59:57,659
know an example is Obamacare you know
 

7011
01:59:57,659 --> 01:59:58,970
know an example is Obamacare you know
there are certain Republican districts

7012
01:59:58,970 --> 01:59:58,980
there are certain Republican districts
 

7013
01:59:58,980 --> 02:00:00,850
there are certain Republican districts
that would have actually officially been

7014
02:00:00,850 --> 02:00:00,860
that would have actually officially been
 

7015
02:00:00,860 --> 02:00:03,169
that would have actually officially been
benefited by Obamacare but every

7016
02:00:03,169 --> 02:00:03,179
benefited by Obamacare but every
 

7017
02:00:03,179 --> 02:00:05,810
benefited by Obamacare but every
Republican voted against it so and part

7018
02:00:05,810 --> 02:00:05,820
Republican voted against it so and part
 

7019
02:00:05,820 --> 02:00:06,890
Republican voted against it so and part
of the reason is because there's no

7020
02:00:06,890 --> 02:00:06,900
of the reason is because there's no
 

7021
02:00:06,900 --> 02:00:09,350
of the reason is because there's no
longer this obvious majority every few

7022
02:00:09,350 --> 02:00:09,360
longer this obvious majority every few
 

7023
02:00:09,360 --> 02:00:12,169
longer this obvious majority every few
years it switches it's a 50 50 thing and

7024
02:00:12,169 --> 02:00:12,179
years it switches it's a 50 50 thing and
 

7025
02:00:12,179 --> 02:00:14,810
years it switches it's a 50 50 thing and
that's you know partially because it's

7026
02:00:14,810 --> 02:00:14,820
that's you know partially because it's
 

7027
02:00:14,820 --> 02:00:16,490
that's you know partially because it's
become so we've been so subsumed with

7028
02:00:16,490 --> 02:00:16,500
become so we've been so subsumed with
 

7029
02:00:16,500 --> 02:00:18,169
become so we've been so subsumed with
this one National divide of left versus

7030
02:00:18,169 --> 02:00:18,179
this one National divide of left versus
 

7031
02:00:18,179 --> 02:00:20,270
this one National divide of left versus
right that

7032
02:00:20,270 --> 02:00:20,280
right that
 

7033
02:00:20,280 --> 02:00:22,669
right that
um that that that that people are not

7034
02:00:22,669 --> 02:00:22,679
um that that that that people are not
 

7035
02:00:22,679 --> 02:00:23,629
um that that that that people are not
people are whoever you know they're

7036
02:00:23,629 --> 02:00:23,639
people are whoever you know they're
 

7037
02:00:23,639 --> 02:00:25,030
people are whoever you know they're
voting for the same party for president

7038
02:00:25,030 --> 02:00:25,040
voting for the same party for president
 

7039
02:00:25,040 --> 02:00:27,410
voting for the same party for president
uh all the way down the ticket now and

7040
02:00:27,410 --> 02:00:27,420
uh all the way down the ticket now and
 

7041
02:00:27,420 --> 02:00:28,729
uh all the way down the ticket now and
so you have this just kind of 50 50

7042
02:00:28,729 --> 02:00:28,739
so you have this just kind of 50 50
 

7043
02:00:28,739 --> 02:00:30,589
so you have this just kind of 50 50
color war and that's awful for

7044
02:00:30,589 --> 02:00:30,599
color war and that's awful for
 

7045
02:00:30,599 --> 02:00:32,390
color war and that's awful for
compromise so there's like 10 of these

7046
02:00:32,390 --> 02:00:32,400
compromise so there's like 10 of these
 

7047
02:00:32,400 --> 02:00:34,550
compromise so there's like 10 of these
things you know that have redistricting

7048
02:00:34,550 --> 02:00:34,560
things you know that have redistricting
 

7049
02:00:34,560 --> 02:00:37,370
things you know that have redistricting
but also it is social media it is you

7050
02:00:37,370 --> 02:00:37,380
but also it is social media it is you
 

7051
02:00:37,380 --> 02:00:39,229
but also it is social media it is you
know I call it hypercharged tribalism

7052
02:00:39,229 --> 02:00:39,239
know I call it hypercharged tribalism
 

7053
02:00:39,239 --> 02:00:40,850
know I call it hypercharged tribalism
you know in the 60s you had kind of

7054
02:00:40,850 --> 02:00:40,860
you know in the 60s you had kind of
 

7055
02:00:40,860 --> 02:00:42,229
you know in the 60s you had kind of
distributed tribalism you had some

7056
02:00:42,229 --> 02:00:42,239
distributed tribalism you had some
 

7057
02:00:42,239 --> 02:00:44,689
distributed tribalism you had some
people that are worked up about the USSR

7058
02:00:44,689 --> 02:00:44,699
people that are worked up about the USSR
 

7059
02:00:44,699 --> 02:00:46,430
people that are worked up about the USSR
right they're National that's what they

7060
02:00:46,430 --> 02:00:46,440
right they're National that's what they
 

7061

care about U.S versus a foreign some
 

7063
02:00:49,320 --> 02:00:50,149
care about U.S versus a foreign some
people that were saying left versus

7064
02:00:50,149 --> 02:00:50,159
people that were saying left versus
 

7065
02:00:50,159 --> 02:00:51,709
people that were saying left versus
right like they today and then other

7066
02:00:51,709 --> 02:00:51,719
right like they today and then other
 

7067
02:00:51,719 --> 02:00:53,149
right like they today and then other
people that were saying that they were

7068
02:00:53,149 --> 02:00:53,159
people that were saying that they were
 

7069
02:00:53,159 --> 02:00:55,430
people that were saying that they were
fighting within the party but today you

7070
02:00:55,430 --> 02:00:55,440
fighting within the party but today you
 

7071
02:00:55,440 --> 02:00:57,709
fighting within the party but today you
don't have that it's it's the the you

7072
02:00:57,709 --> 02:00:57,719
don't have that it's it's the the you
 

7073
02:00:57,719 --> 02:00:59,450
don't have that it's it's the the you
have ideological realignment so you kind

7074
02:00:59,450 --> 02:00:59,460
have ideological realignment so you kind
 

7075
02:00:59,460 --> 02:01:00,770
have ideological realignment so you kind
of got rid of a lot of the in-party

7076
02:01:00,770 --> 02:01:00,780
of got rid of a lot of the in-party
 

7077
02:01:00,780 --> 02:01:02,030
of got rid of a lot of the in-party
fighting and then there's hasn't been

7078
02:01:02,030 --> 02:01:02,040
fighting and then there's hasn't been
 

7079
02:01:02,040 --> 02:01:03,890
fighting and then there's hasn't been
that big of a foreign threat not nothing

7080
02:01:03,890 --> 02:01:03,900
that big of a foreign threat not nothing
 

7081
02:01:03,900 --> 02:01:06,290
that big of a foreign threat not nothing
like the USSR for a long time so you

7082
02:01:06,290 --> 02:01:06,300
like the USSR for a long time so you
 

7083
02:01:06,300 --> 02:01:07,609
like the USSR for a long time so you
kind of lost that and what's left is

7084
02:01:07,609 --> 02:01:07,619
kind of lost that and what's left is
 

7085
02:01:07,619 --> 02:01:09,770
kind of lost that and what's left is
Justice left versus right thing and so

7086
02:01:09,770 --> 02:01:09,780
Justice left versus right thing and so
 

7087
02:01:09,780 --> 02:01:10,970
Justice left versus right thing and so
that's kind of this hypercharged

7088
02:01:10,970 --> 02:01:10,980
that's kind of this hypercharged
 

7089
02:01:10,980 --> 02:01:14,209
that's kind of this hypercharged
Whirlpool that subsumes everything and

7090
02:01:14,209 --> 02:01:14,219
Whirlpool that subsumes everything and
 

7091
02:01:14,219 --> 02:01:16,729
Whirlpool that subsumes everything and
um and so yeah yeah it's I mean you

7092
02:01:16,729 --> 02:01:16,739
um and so yeah yeah it's I mean you
 

7093
02:01:16,739 --> 02:01:18,649
um and so yeah yeah it's I mean you
people point to Newt Gingrich you know

7094
02:01:18,649 --> 02:01:18,659
people point to Newt Gingrich you know
 

7095
02:01:18,659 --> 02:01:19,970
people point to Newt Gingrich you know
people like there's certain characters

7096
02:01:19,970 --> 02:01:19,980
people like there's certain characters
 

7097
02:01:19,980 --> 02:01:22,669
people like there's certain characters
that enacted policies that stoked this

7098
02:01:22,669 --> 02:01:22,679
that enacted policies that stoked this
 

7099
02:01:22,679 --> 02:01:24,470
that enacted policies that stoked this
kind of thing but I I think this is a

7100
02:01:24,470 --> 02:01:24,480
kind of thing but I I think this is a
 

7101
02:01:24,480 --> 02:01:26,030
kind of thing but I I think this is a
much bigger kind of environmental shift

7102
02:01:26,030 --> 02:01:26,040
much bigger kind of environmental shift
 

7103
02:01:26,040 --> 02:01:27,530
much bigger kind of environmental shift
well that's going back to our questions

7104
02:01:27,530 --> 02:01:27,540
well that's going back to our questions
 

7105
02:01:27,540 --> 02:01:29,270
well that's going back to our questions
about the role of individuals in human

7106
02:01:29,270 --> 02:01:29,280
about the role of individuals in human
 

7107
02:01:29,280 --> 02:01:32,270
about the role of individuals in human
history so the the interesting one of

7108
02:01:32,270 --> 02:01:32,280
history so the the interesting one of
 

7109
02:01:32,280 --> 02:01:33,589
history so the the interesting one of
the many interesting questions here is

7110
02:01:33,589 --> 02:01:33,599
the many interesting questions here is
 

7111
02:01:33,599 --> 02:01:36,890
the many interesting questions here is
about Trump is he a symptom or a Cause

7112
02:01:36,890 --> 02:01:36,900
about Trump is he a symptom or a Cause
 

7113
02:01:36,900 --> 02:01:38,870
about Trump is he a symptom or a Cause
because it seems to be from the public

7114
02:01:38,870 --> 02:01:38,880
because it seems to be from the public
 

7115
02:01:38,880 --> 02:01:41,270
because it seems to be from the public
narrative such a significant

7116
02:01:41,270 --> 02:01:41,280
narrative such a significant
 

7117
02:01:41,280 --> 02:01:43,790
narrative such a significant
Catalyst for some of the things we're

7118
02:01:43,790 --> 02:01:43,800
Catalyst for some of the things we're
 

7119
02:01:43,800 --> 02:01:45,050
Catalyst for some of the things we're
seeing this goes back to what we were

7120
02:01:45,050 --> 02:01:45,060
seeing this goes back to what we were
 

7121
02:01:45,060 --> 02:01:46,609
seeing this goes back to what we were
talking about earlier right like is it

7122
02:01:46,609 --> 02:01:46,619
talking about earlier right like is it
 

7123
02:01:46,619 --> 02:01:48,649
talking about earlier right like is it
is it the person or is the times I think

7124
02:01:48,649 --> 02:01:48,659
is it the person or is the times I think
 

7125
02:01:48,659 --> 02:01:50,570
is it the person or is the times I think
he's a perfect example of it's a both

7126
02:01:50,570 --> 02:01:50,580
he's a perfect example of it's a both
 

7127
02:01:50,580 --> 02:01:52,609
he's a perfect example of it's a both
situation I don't think that I don't

7128
02:01:52,609 --> 02:01:52,619
situation I don't think that I don't
 

7129
02:01:52,619 --> 02:01:54,109
situation I don't think that I don't
think if you pluck Trump out of the

7130
02:01:54,109 --> 02:01:54,119
think if you pluck Trump out of the
 

7131
02:01:54,119 --> 02:01:55,310
think if you pluck Trump out of the
situation I don't think that Trump was

7132
02:01:55,310 --> 02:01:55,320
situation I don't think that Trump was
 

7133
02:01:55,320 --> 02:01:57,410
situation I don't think that Trump was
inevitable but I think we were very

7134
02:01:57,410 --> 02:01:57,420
inevitable but I think we were very
 

7135
02:01:57,420 --> 02:02:00,709
inevitable but I think we were very
vulnerable to a demagogue and if you

7136
02:02:00,709 --> 02:02:00,719
vulnerable to a demagogue and if you
 

7137
02:02:00,719 --> 02:02:01,910
vulnerable to a demagogue and if you
hadn't been Trump would have had no

7138
02:02:01,910 --> 02:02:01,920
hadn't been Trump would have had no
 

7139
02:02:01,920 --> 02:02:04,070
hadn't been Trump would have had no
chance and so what and why were we

7140
02:02:04,070 --> 02:02:04,080
chance and so what and why were we
 

7141
02:02:04,080 --> 02:02:07,790
chance and so what and why were we
vulnerable to a demagogue is because you

know one by one and it's still getting

7654
02:11:10,250 --> 02:11:10,260
know one by one and it's still getting
 

7655
02:11:10,260 --> 02:11:11,330

America and liberal social justice

7658
02:11:13,550 --> 02:11:13,560
America and liberal social justice
 

7659
02:11:13,560 --> 02:11:15,470
America and liberal social justice
basically is the practice of saying

7660
02:11:15,470 --> 02:11:15,480
basically is the practice of saying
 

7661
02:11:15,480 --> 02:11:17,990
basically is the practice of saying
where are we not being perfect liberals

7662
02:11:17,990 --> 02:11:18,000
where are we not being perfect liberals
 

7663
02:11:18,000 --> 02:11:20,750
where are we not being perfect liberals
and now let's fix that

7664
02:11:20,750 --> 02:11:20,760
and now let's fix that
 

7665
02:11:20,760 --> 02:11:22,910
and now let's fix that
so that that's the idea of liberalism

7666
02:11:22,910 --> 02:11:22,920
so that that's the idea of liberalism
 

7667
02:11:22,920 --> 02:11:24,770
so that that's the idea of liberalism
that permeates the history of the United

7668
02:11:24,770 --> 02:11:24,780
that permeates the history of the United
 

7669
02:11:24,780 --> 02:11:26,870
that permeates the history of the United
States but then there's interplay heaven

7670
02:11:26,870 --> 02:11:26,880
States but then there's interplay heaven
 

7671
02:11:26,880 --> 02:11:30,050
States but then there's interplay heaven
and so many good images in this book but

7672
02:11:30,050 --> 02:11:30,060
and so many good images in this book but
 

7673
02:11:30,060 --> 02:11:32,089
and so many good images in this book but
one of them is uh is highlighting the

7674
02:11:32,089 --> 02:11:32,099
one of them is uh is highlighting the
 

7675
02:11:32,099 --> 02:11:34,310
one of them is uh is highlighting the
interplay of different ideas over the

7676
02:11:34,310 --> 02:11:34,320
interplay of different ideas over the
 

7677
02:11:34,320 --> 02:11:37,070
interplay of different ideas over the
past uh let's say 100 years so

7678
02:11:37,070 --> 02:11:37,080
past uh let's say 100 years so
 

7679
02:11:37,080 --> 02:11:39,589
past uh let's say 100 years so
liberalism is on one side there's that

7680
02:11:39,589 --> 02:11:39,599
liberalism is on one side there's that
 

7681
02:11:39,599 --> 02:11:42,530
liberalism is on one side there's that
thread there's Marxism on the other and

7682
02:11:42,530 --> 02:11:42,540
thread there's Marxism on the other and
 

7683
02:11:42,540 --> 02:11:44,930
thread there's Marxism on the other and
then there's post-modernism

7684
02:11:44,930 --> 02:11:44,940
then there's post-modernism
 

7685
02:11:44,940 --> 02:11:47,689
then there's post-modernism
how do those interplay together so it's

7686
02:11:47,689 --> 02:11:47,699
how do those interplay together so it's
 

7687
02:11:47,699 --> 02:11:49,129
how do those interplay together so it's
interesting because

7688
02:11:49,129 --> 02:11:49,139
interesting because
 

7689
02:11:49,139 --> 02:11:50,930
interesting because
Marxism

7690
02:11:50,930 --> 02:11:50,940
Marxism
 

7691
02:11:50,940 --> 02:11:53,270
Marxism
is and all of its various you know

7692
02:11:53,270 --> 02:11:53,280
is and all of its various you know
 

7693
02:11:53,280 --> 02:11:54,589
is and all of its various you know
descendants obviously there's a lot of

7694
02:11:54,589 --> 02:11:54,599
descendants obviously there's a lot of
 

7695
02:11:54,599 --> 02:11:56,089
descendants obviously there's a lot of
things that are rooted in Marxism that

7696
02:11:56,089 --> 02:11:56,099
things that are rooted in Marxism that
 

7697
02:11:56,099 --> 02:11:58,370
things that are rooted in Marxism that
aren't you know the same thing as what

7698
02:11:58,370 --> 02:11:58,380
aren't you know the same thing as what
 

7699
02:11:58,380 --> 02:11:59,810
aren't you know the same thing as what
Karl Marx preached

7700
02:11:59,810 --> 02:11:59,820
Karl Marx preached
 

7701
02:11:59,820 --> 02:12:02,330
Karl Marx preached

the Marxist thread that has been going

7912
02:15:32,209 --> 02:15:32,219
the Marxist thread that has been going
 

7913
02:15:32,219 --> 02:15:36,050
the Marxist thread that has been going
on in lots of countries and has and and

7914
02:15:36,050 --> 02:15:36,060
on in lots of countries and has and and

what they all have in common but the
 

7919
02:15:39,179 --> 02:15:41,270
what they all have in common but the
upper and lower you know and for Marx

7920
02:15:41,270 --> 02:15:41,280
upper and lower you know and for Marx
 

7921
02:15:41,280 --> 02:15:43,430
upper and lower you know and for Marx
was the ruling class and the oppressed

7922
02:15:43,430 --> 02:15:43,440
was the ruling class and the oppressed
 

7923
02:15:43,440 --> 02:15:45,470
was the ruling class and the oppressed
class it was economic

7924
02:15:45,470 --> 02:15:45,480
class it was economic
 

7925
02:15:45,480 --> 02:15:48,669
class it was economic
um and then uh but you come here and and

7926
02:15:48,669 --> 02:15:48,679
um and then uh but you come here and and
 

7927
02:15:48,679 --> 02:15:51,050
um and then uh but you come here and and
the economic class doesn't you know

7928
02:15:51,050 --> 02:15:51,060
the economic class doesn't you know
 

7929
02:15:51,060 --> 02:15:52,910
the economic class doesn't you know
doesn't resonate as much here as it did

7930
02:15:52,910 --> 02:15:52,920
doesn't resonate as much here as it did
 

7931
02:15:52,920 --> 02:15:54,109
doesn't resonate as much here as it did
maybe in some of those other places but

7932
02:15:54,109 --> 02:15:54,119
maybe in some of those other places but
 

7933
02:15:54,119 --> 02:15:56,450
maybe in some of those other places but
what does resonate here in the 60s and

7934
02:15:56,450 --> 02:15:56,460
what does resonate here in the 60s and
 

7935
02:15:56,460 --> 02:15:59,510
what does resonate here in the 60s and
70s is race and gender and these kind of

7936
02:15:59,510 --> 02:15:59,520
70s is race and gender and these kind of
 

7937
02:15:59,520 --> 02:16:02,629
70s is race and gender and these kind of
social justice disagreements and so what

7938
02:16:02,629 --> 02:16:02,639
social justice disagreements and so what
 

7939
02:16:02,639 --> 02:16:04,129
social justice disagreements and so what
social justice fundamentalism is is

7940
02:16:04,129 --> 02:16:04,139
social justice fundamentalism is is
 

7941
02:16:04,139 --> 02:16:06,290
social justice fundamentalism is is
basically this this tried and true

7942
02:16:06,290 --> 02:16:06,300
basically this this tried and true
 

7943
02:16:06,300 --> 02:16:09,430
basically this this tried and true
framework of

7944
02:16:09,430 --> 02:16:09,440
framework of
 

7945
02:16:09,440 --> 02:16:12,350
framework of
you know this Marxist framework

7946
02:16:12,350 --> 02:16:12,360
you know this Marxist framework
 

7947
02:16:12,360 --> 02:16:14,569
you know this Marxist framework
kind of with a new skin on it which is

7948
02:16:14,569 --> 02:16:14,579
kind of with a new skin on it which is
 

7949
02:16:14,579 --> 02:16:17,209
kind of with a new skin on it which is
American social justice and then made

7950
02:16:17,209 --> 02:16:17,219
American social justice and then made
 

7951
02:16:17,219 --> 02:16:18,890
American social justice and then made
even more radical with the infusion of

7952
02:16:18,890 --> 02:16:18,900
even more radical with the infusion of
 

7953
02:16:18,900 --> 02:16:20,870
even more radical with the infusion of
post-modernism where you know not just

7954
02:16:20,870 --> 02:16:20,880
post-modernism where you know not just
 

7955
02:16:20,880 --> 02:16:22,790
post-modernism where you know not just
as liberalism bad but actually the sign

7956
02:16:22,790 --> 02:16:22,800
as liberalism bad but actually the sign
 

7957
02:16:22,800 --> 02:16:24,950
as liberalism bad but actually the sign
you know that like you said math can be

7958
02:16:24,950 --> 02:16:24,960
you know that like you said math can be
 

7959
02:16:24,960 --> 02:16:26,890
you know that like you said math can be
racist so it's this kind of like

7960
02:16:26,890 --> 02:16:26,900
racist so it's this kind of like
 

7961
02:16:26,900 --> 02:16:29,209
racist so it's this kind of like
philosophical Frankenstein this like

7962
02:16:29,209 --> 02:16:29,219
philosophical Frankenstein this like
 

7963
02:16:29,219 --> 02:16:31,910
philosophical Frankenstein this like
stitched together of these it and has

7964
02:16:31,910 --> 02:16:31,920
stitched together of these it and has
 

7965
02:16:31,920 --> 02:16:33,650
stitched together of these it and has
and and so again it's called you you

7966
02:16:33,650 --> 02:16:33,660
and and so again it's called you you
 

7967
02:16:33,660 --> 02:16:35,209
and and so again it's called you you
know they they wear the same uniform as

7968
02:16:35,209 --> 02:16:35,219
know they they wear the same uniform as
 

7969
02:16:35,219 --> 02:16:36,469
know they they wear the same uniform as
the liberal social justice they say

7970
02:16:36,469 --> 02:16:36,479
the liberal social justice they say
 

7971
02:16:36,479 --> 02:16:38,150
the liberal social justice they say
social justice right you know Racial

7972
02:16:38,150 --> 02:16:38,160
social justice right you know Racial
 

7973
02:16:38,160 --> 02:16:39,230
social justice right you know Racial
equality

7974
02:16:39,230 --> 02:16:39,240
equality
 

7975
02:16:39,240 --> 02:16:41,570
equality
but it has nothing to do with liberal

7976
02:16:41,570 --> 02:16:41,580
but it has nothing to do with liberal
 

7977
02:16:41,580 --> 02:16:43,790
but it has nothing to do with liberal
social justice it is directly opposed to

7978
02:16:43,790 --> 02:16:43,800
social justice it is directly opposed to
 

7979
02:16:43,800 --> 02:16:44,990
social justice it is directly opposed to
Liberal social justice this is

7980
02:16:44,990 --> 02:16:45,000
Liberal social justice this is
 

7981
02:16:45,000 --> 02:16:46,910
Liberal social justice this is
fascinating the evolution

7982
02:16:46,910 --> 02:16:46,920
fascinating the evolution
 

7983
02:16:46,920 --> 02:16:49,490
fascinating the evolution
of ideas if if we ignore the harm done

7984
02:16:49,490 --> 02:16:49,500
of ideas if if we ignore the harm done
 

7985
02:16:49,500 --> 02:16:51,950
of ideas if if we ignore the harm done
by it it's fascinating how humans get

7986
02:16:51,950 --> 02:16:51,960
by it it's fascinating how humans get
 

7987
02:16:51,960 --> 02:16:54,230
by it it's fascinating how humans get
together and evolve these ideas so as

7988
02:16:54,230 --> 02:16:54,240
together and evolve these ideas so as
 

7989
02:16:54,240 --> 02:16:56,929
together and evolve these ideas so as
you show Marxism is the idea that

7990
02:16:56,929 --> 02:16:56,939
you show Marxism is the idea that
 

7991
02:16:56,939 --> 02:16:58,849
you show Marxism is the idea that
Society is a zero-sum I mean I guess

7992
02:16:58,849 --> 02:16:58,859
Society is a zero-sum I mean I guess
 

7993
02:16:58,859 --> 02:17:00,349
Society is a zero-sum I mean I guess
zero sum is a really important thing

7994
02:17:00,349 --> 02:17:00,359
zero sum is a really important thing
 

7995
02:17:00,359 --> 02:17:02,990
zero sum is a really important thing
here uh zero-sum struggle between the

7996
02:17:02,990 --> 02:17:03,000
here uh zero-sum struggle between the
 

7997
02:17:03,000 --> 02:17:04,730
here uh zero-sum struggle between the
ruling class and the working class with

7998
02:17:04,730 --> 02:17:04,740
ruling class and the working class with
 

7999
02:17:04,740 --> 02:17:07,250
ruling class and the working class with
power being exerted through politics and

8000
02:17:07,250 --> 02:17:07,260
power being exerted through politics and
 

8001
02:17:07,260 --> 02:17:09,770
power being exerted through politics and
economics then you add

8002
02:17:09,770 --> 02:17:09,780
economics then you add
 

8003
02:17:09,780 --> 02:17:12,530
economics then you add
critical theory Marxism 2.0 on top of

8004
02:17:12,530 --> 02:17:12,540
critical theory Marxism 2.0 on top of
 

8005
02:17:12,540 --> 02:17:14,570
critical theory Marxism 2.0 on top of
that and you add to politics and

8006
02:17:14,570 --> 02:17:14,580
that and you add to politics and
 

8007
02:17:14,580 --> 02:17:15,889
that and you add to politics and
economics you add culture and

8008
02:17:15,889 --> 02:17:15,899
economics you add culture and
 

8009
02:17:15,899 --> 02:17:18,469
economics you add culture and
institutions and then on top of that for

8010
02:17:18,469 --> 02:17:18,479
institutions and then on top of that for
 

8011
02:17:18,479 --> 02:17:20,629
institutions and then on top of that for
postmodernism you add science you have

8012
02:17:20,629 --> 02:17:20,639
postmodernism you add science you have
 

8013
02:17:20,639 --> 02:17:22,490
postmodernism you add science you have
morality basically anything else you can

8014
02:17:22,490 --> 02:17:22,500
morality basically anything else you can
 

8015
02:17:22,500 --> 02:17:24,110
morality basically anything else you can
think to stitch together Frankenstein

8016
02:17:24,110 --> 02:17:24,120
think to stitch together Frankenstein
 

8017
02:17:24,120 --> 02:17:25,429
think to stitch together Frankenstein
and if you notice and which is not

8018
02:17:25,429 --> 02:17:25,439
and if you notice and which is not
 

8019
02:17:25,439 --> 02:17:27,230
and if you notice and which is not
necessarily bad but in this case I think

8020
02:17:27,230 --> 02:17:27,240
necessarily bad but in this case I think
 

8021
02:17:27,240 --> 02:17:28,790
necessarily bad but in this case I think
it's actually violating the Marxist

8022
02:17:28,790 --> 02:17:28,800
it's actually violating the Marxist
 

8023
02:17:28,800 --> 02:17:31,129
it's actually violating the Marxist

you know and it's violating the
 

8027
02:17:32,880 --> 02:17:34,370
you know and it's violating the
post-modernism because what

02:17:34,370 --> 02:17:34,380
post-modernism because what
 

8029
02:17:34,380 --> 02:17:35,990

hundreds of years
 

8373
02:23:47,520 --> 02:23:50,630
hundreds of years
and they all rely on trust public trust

8374
02:23:50,630 --> 02:23:50,640
and they all rely on trust public trust
 

8375
02:23:50,640 --> 02:23:52,790
and they all rely on trust public trust
and there's certain kind of feeling of

8376
02:23:52,790 --> 02:23:52,800
and there's certain kind of feeling of
 

8377
02:23:52,800 --> 02:23:55,250
and there's certain kind of feeling of
unity that actually is critical to a

02:23:55,250 --> 02:23:55,260
unity that actually is critical to a
 

8379
02:23:55,260 --> 02:23:57,530
unity that actually is critical to a
liberal democracy's functioning and with

8380

02:24:00,830 --> 02:24:00,840
I see this thing is as a parasite on
 

8383
02:24:00,840 --> 02:24:03,530
I see this thing is as a parasite on
that that whose goal is and I'm not

8384
02:24:03,530 --> 02:24:03,540
that that whose goal is and I'm not

saying by the way each individual in
 

8387
02:24:05,160 --> 02:24:06,650
saying by the way each individual in
this is I don't think they're bad people

8388
02:24:06,650 --> 02:24:06,660
this is I don't think they're bad people
 

8389
02:24:06,660 --> 02:24:08,510
this is I don't think they're bad people
I think that it's it's the ideology

8390
02:24:08,510 --> 02:24:08,520
I think that it's it's the ideology
 

8391
02:24:08,520 --> 02:24:11,389
I think that it's it's the ideology
itself has the property of its goal is

8392
02:24:11,389 --> 02:24:11,399
itself has the property of its goal is
 

8393
02:24:11,399 --> 02:24:14,150
itself has the property of its goal is
to tear apart the pretty delicate

8394
02:24:14,150 --> 02:24:14,160
to tear apart the pretty delicate
 

8395
02:24:14,160 --> 02:24:15,770
to tear apart the pretty delicate
workings of the liberal democracy and

8396
02:24:15,770 --> 02:24:15,780
workings of the liberal democracy and
 

8397
02:24:15,780 --> 02:24:18,290
workings of the liberal democracy and
Shred the critical lines of trust

8398
02:24:18,290 --> 02:24:18,300
Shred the critical lines of trust
 

8399
02:24:18,300 --> 02:24:21,170
Shred the critical lines of trust
and so you talk about Ai and you talk

8400
02:24:21,170 --> 02:24:21,180
and so you talk about Ai and you talk
 

8401
02:24:21,180 --> 02:24:22,250
and so you talk about Ai and you talk
about all these other big problems

8402
02:24:22,250 --> 02:24:22,260
about all these other big problems
 

8403
02:24:22,260 --> 02:24:24,710
about all these other big problems
nuclear right the reason I I like

8404
02:24:24,710 --> 02:24:24,720
nuclear right the reason I I like
 

8405
02:24:24,720 --> 02:24:26,030
nuclear right the reason I I like
writing about that stuff a lot more than

8406
02:24:26,030 --> 02:24:26,040
writing about that stuff a lot more than

I like writing about politics this was a
 

8409
02:24:27,600 --> 02:24:30,349
I like writing about politics this was a
fun topic for me is because I realized

8410
02:24:30,349 --> 02:24:30,359
fun topic for me is because I realized
 

8411
02:24:30,359 --> 02:24:32,690
fun topic for me is because I realized
that like all of those things if they're

8412
02:24:32,690 --> 02:24:32,700
that like all of those things if they're
 

8413

gonna have a good future with those

8414
02:24:33,950 --> 02:24:33,960
gonna have a good future with those
 

8415
02:24:33,960 --> 02:24:35,809
gonna have a good future with those
things and they're actually threats like

8416
02:24:35,809 --> 02:24:35,819
things and they're actually threats like
 

8417
02:24:35,819 --> 02:24:37,010
things and they're actually threats like
I said we need to have a wits about us

8418
02:24:37,010 --> 02:24:37,020
I said we need to have a wits about us
 

8419
02:24:37,020 --> 02:24:39,530
I said we need to have a wits about us
and we need the the liberal you know

8420
02:24:39,530 --> 02:24:39,540
and we need the the liberal you know
 

8421
02:24:39,540 --> 02:24:42,530
and we need the the liberal you know
gears and and levers working we need the

8422
02:24:42,530 --> 02:24:42,540
gears and and levers working we need the
 

8423
02:24:42,540 --> 02:24:44,210
gears and and levers working we need the
liberal machine working and so if

8424
02:24:44,210 --> 02:24:44,220
liberal machine working and so if
 

8425
02:24:44,220 --> 02:24:45,530
liberal machine working and so if
something's threatening to undermine

8426
02:24:45,530 --> 02:24:45,540
something's threatening to undermine
 

8427
02:24:45,540 --> 02:24:48,230
something's threatening to undermine
that it affects everything else

8428
02:24:48,230 --> 02:24:48,240
that it affects everything else
 

8429
02:24:48,240 --> 02:24:50,150
that it affects everything else
we need to have our scientific mind

8430
02:24:50,150 --> 02:24:50,160
we need to have our scientific mind
 

8431
02:24:50,160 --> 02:24:52,790
we need to have our scientific mind
about us about these foundational ideas

8432
02:24:52,790 --> 02:24:52,800
about us about these foundational ideas
 

8433
02:24:52,800 --> 02:24:56,150
about us about these foundational ideas
but I I guess my sense of hope comes

8434
02:24:56,150 --> 02:24:56,160
but I I guess my sense of hope comes
 

8435
02:24:56,160 --> 02:24:58,910
but I I guess my sense of hope comes
from observing the immune system respond

8436
02:24:58,910 --> 02:24:58,920
from observing the immune system respond
 

8437
02:24:58,920 --> 02:25:00,410
from observing the immune system respond

02:25:00,410 --> 02:25:00,420
to wokism
 

8439
02:25:00,420 --> 02:25:03,610
to wokism
there seems to be a pro-liberalism

8440
02:25:03,610 --> 02:25:03,620
there seems to be a pro-liberalism
 

8441

immune system
 

8443
02:25:05,520 --> 02:25:07,309
immune system
and not only that so like there's

8444
02:25:07,309 --> 02:25:07,319
and not only that so like there's
 

8445
02:25:07,319 --> 02:25:09,290
and not only that so like there's
intellectuals there's people that are

intellectuals there's people that are
 

8447
02:25:09,300 --> 02:25:11,389
intellectuals there's people that are
willing to do the fight you talk about

courage are being courageous and there
 

8451
02:25:14,939 --> 02:25:17,210
courage are being courageous and there
is a hunger for that such that those

8452
02:25:17,210 --> 02:25:17,220
is a hunger for that such that those
 

8453
02:25:17,220 --> 02:25:19,070
is a hunger for that such that those
ideas can become viral and they take

8454
02:25:19,070 --> 02:25:19,080
ideas can become viral and they take

02:25:19,080 --> 02:25:22,250
ideas can become viral and they take
over so I just don't see a mechanism by

8456
02:25:22,250 --> 02:25:22,260
over so I just don't see a mechanism by
 

8457
02:25:22,260 --> 02:25:24,429
over so I just don't see a mechanism by
which wokism

8458
02:25:24,429 --> 02:25:24,439
which wokism
 

8459
02:25:24,439 --> 02:25:27,650
which wokism
accelerates like exponentially and takes

8460
02:25:27,650 --> 02:25:27,660
accelerates like exponentially and takes
 

8461
02:25:27,660 --> 02:25:30,349
accelerates like exponentially and takes
over like is expand it feels like as it

8462
02:25:30,349 --> 02:25:30,359
over like is expand it feels like as it
 

8463
02:25:30,359 --> 02:25:33,710
over like is expand it feels like as it
expands the immune system responds uh of

8464
02:25:33,710 --> 02:25:33,720
expands the immune system responds uh of
 

8465
02:25:33,720 --> 02:25:35,870
expands the immune system responds uh of
the the the immune system of the of

8466
02:25:35,870 --> 02:25:35,880
the the the immune system of the of
 

8467
02:25:35,880 --> 02:25:39,290
the the the immune system of the of
liberalism of of basically a country in

8468
02:25:39,290 --> 02:25:39,300
liberalism of of basically a country in
 

8469
02:25:39,300 --> 02:25:41,090
liberalism of of basically a country in
at least the United States that's still

8470
02:25:41,090 --> 02:25:41,100
at least the United States that's still
 

8471
02:25:41,100 --> 02:25:42,889
at least the United States that's still
ultimately at the core of the individual

8472
02:25:42,889 --> 02:25:42,899
ultimately at the core of the individual

02:25:49,809 --> 02:25:49,819
individual but that's the battle
 

8479
02:25:49,819 --> 02:25:52,370
individual but that's the battle
so to me it is like a virus and an

8480
02:25:52,370 --> 02:25:52,380
so to me it is like a virus and an
 

8481
02:25:52,380 --> 02:25:54,830
so to me it is like a virus and an
immune system yeah and

8482
02:25:54,830 --> 02:25:54,840
immune system yeah and
 

8483
02:25:54,840 --> 02:25:56,870
immune system yeah and
I totally agree I see the same story

8484
02:25:56,870 --> 02:25:56,880
I totally agree I see the same story
 

8485
02:25:56,880 --> 02:25:58,550
I totally agree I see the same story
happening and I you know I'm sitting

8486
02:25:58,550 --> 02:25:58,560
happening and I you know I'm sitting
 

8487
02:25:58,560 --> 02:26:00,410
happening and I you know I'm sitting
here rooting for the immune system but

8488
02:26:00,410 --> 02:26:00,420
here rooting for the immune system but
 

8489
02:26:00,420 --> 02:26:02,389
here rooting for the immune system but
you're still worried well here's the

8490
02:26:02,389 --> 02:26:02,399
you're still worried well here's the
 

8491
02:26:02,399 --> 02:26:05,030
you're still worried well here's the
thing so a liberal democracy is in

8492
02:26:05,030 --> 02:26:05,040
thing so a liberal democracy is in
 

8493
02:26:05,040 --> 02:26:07,969
thing so a liberal democracy is in
always going to be vulnerable to a

8494
02:26:07,969 --> 02:26:07,979
always going to be vulnerable to a
 

8495
02:26:07,979 --> 02:26:09,770
always going to be vulnerable to a
movement like this right and there will

8496
02:26:09,770 --> 02:26:09,780
movement like this right and there will
 

8497
02:26:09,780 --> 02:26:12,590
movement like this right and there will
be more because it's not a totalitarian

8498
02:26:12,590 --> 02:26:12,600
be more because it's not a totalitarian
 

8499
02:26:12,600 --> 02:26:14,870
be more because it's not a totalitarian
dictatorship because if you can socially

8500
02:26:14,870 --> 02:26:14,880
dictatorship because if you can socially
 

8501
02:26:14,880 --> 02:26:16,490
dictatorship because if you can socially
pressure people to not say what they're

8502
02:26:16,490 --> 02:26:16,500
pressure people to not say what they're
 

8503
02:26:16,500 --> 02:26:18,349
pressure people to not say what they're
thinking you can suddenly start to just

8504
02:26:18,349 --> 02:26:18,359
thinking you can suddenly start to just
 

8505
02:26:18,359 --> 02:26:20,630
thinking you can suddenly start to just
take over right you can break the

8506
02:26:20,630 --> 02:26:20,640
take over right you can break the
 

8507
02:26:20,640 --> 02:26:22,309
take over right you can break the
liberalism of the liberal democracy

8508
02:26:22,309 --> 02:26:22,319
liberalism of the liberal democracy
 

8509
02:26:22,319 --> 02:26:23,630
liberalism of the liberal democracy
quite easily and suddenly a lot of

8510
02:26:23,630 --> 02:26:23,640
quite easily and suddenly a lot of
 

8511
02:26:23,640 --> 02:26:25,070
quite easily and suddenly a lot of
things are illiberal

8512
02:26:25,070 --> 02:26:25,080
things are illiberal
 

8513
02:26:25,080 --> 02:26:27,530
things are illiberal
on the other hand

8514
02:26:27,530 --> 02:26:27,540
on the other hand
 

8515
02:26:27,540 --> 02:26:30,050
on the other hand
the same vulnerability the same system

8516
02:26:30,050 --> 02:26:30,060
the same vulnerability the same system
 

8517
02:26:30,060 --> 02:26:32,030
the same vulnerability the same system
that's vulnerable to that also is hard

8518
02:26:32,030 --> 02:26:32,040
that's vulnerable to that also is hard
 

8519
02:26:32,040 --> 02:26:33,830
that's vulnerable to that also is hard
to truly conquer

8520
02:26:33,830 --> 02:26:33,840
to truly conquer
 

8521
02:26:33,840 --> 02:26:36,170
to truly conquer
because now the maoists

8522
02:26:36,170 --> 02:26:36,180
because now the maoists
 

8523
02:26:36,180 --> 02:26:37,969
because now the maoists
right similar kind of vibe they were

8524
02:26:37,969 --> 02:26:37,979
right similar kind of vibe they were
 

8525
02:26:37,979 --> 02:26:40,550
right similar kind of vibe they were
saying that science is evil and as a you

8526
02:26:40,550 --> 02:26:40,560
saying that science is evil and as a you
 

8527
02:26:40,560 --> 02:26:42,170
saying that science is evil and as a you
know and that they're the intellectuals

8528
02:26:42,170 --> 02:26:42,180
know and that they're the intellectuals
 

8529

02:27:11,040 --> 02:27:12,290
shutting up you can't maybe imprison
them and murder them but if you can

02:27:12,290 --> 02:27:12,300
them and murder them but if you can
 

8557
02:27:12,300 --> 02:27:13,670

the same effect so the soft cudgel can

8562
02:27:17,570 --> 02:27:17,580
the same effect so the soft cudgel can
 

8563
02:27:17,580 --> 02:27:19,550
the same effect so the soft cudgel can
have the same effect for a while but the

that's the first just just I think just

8714
02:29:50,030 --> 02:29:50,040
that's the first just just I think just
 

8715
02:29:50,040 --> 02:29:54,710
that's the first just just I think just
to kind of do a self-audit and and and

8716
02:29:54,710 --> 02:29:54,720
to kind of do a self-audit and and and
 

8717
02:29:54,720 --> 02:29:57,469
to kind of do a self-audit and and and
um and I think that like just just some

8718
02:29:57,469 --> 02:29:57,479
um and I think that like just just some
 

8719
02:29:57,479 --> 02:29:58,849
um and I think that like just just some
awareness like that it's just a

8720
02:29:58,849 --> 02:29:58,859
awareness like that it's just a
 

8721
02:29:58,859 --> 02:30:00,590
awareness like that it's just a
self-audit about these things can can go

8722
02:30:00,590 --> 02:30:00,600
self-audit about these things can can go
 

8723
02:30:00,600 --> 02:30:02,870
self-audit about these things can can go
a long way but if you don't if you keep

8724
02:30:02,870 --> 02:30:02,880
a long way but if you don't if you keep
 

8725
02:30:02,880 --> 02:30:05,510
a long way but if you don't if you keep
it to yourself it's almost useless

8726
02:30:05,510 --> 02:30:05,520
it to yourself it's almost useless
 

8727
02:30:05,520 --> 02:30:07,490
it to yourself it's almost useless
because if it doesn't if you don't have

8728
02:30:07,490 --> 02:30:07,500
because if it doesn't if you don't have
 

8729
02:30:07,500 --> 02:30:08,809
because if it doesn't if you don't have
without you know awareness without

8730
02:30:08,809 --> 02:30:08,819
without you know awareness without
 

8731
02:30:08,819 --> 02:30:12,170
without you know awareness without
courage does very little so courage is

8732

courage does very little so courage is
 

8733
02:30:12,180 --> 02:30:13,849
courage does very little so courage is
when you take that awareness and you

8734
02:30:13,849 --> 02:30:13,859
when you take that awareness and you
 

8735
02:30:13,859 --> 02:30:15,590
when you take that awareness and you
actually export it out into the world

8736
02:30:15,590 --> 02:30:15,600
actually export it out into the world
 

8737
02:30:15,600 --> 02:30:17,510
actually export it out into the world

and it starts affecting other people and
 

8739
02:30:17,520 --> 02:30:19,130
and it starts affecting other people and
so courage can happen on multiple levels

8740
02:30:19,130 --> 02:30:19,140
so courage can happen on multiple levels
 

8741
02:30:19,140 --> 02:30:21,710

02:32:01,800 --> 02:32:04,130
I think it's a useful tool is this thing
called a thought pile which is if you

8842
02:32:04,130 --> 02:32:04,140
called a thought pile which is if you
 

8843
02:32:04,140 --> 02:32:06,349
called a thought pile which is if you
have a On Any Given issue you have a

8844
02:32:06,349 --> 02:32:06,359
have a On Any Given issue you have a
 

8845
02:32:06,359 --> 02:32:08,510
have a On Any Given issue you have a
horizontal spectrum and just say I could

8846
02:32:08,510 --> 02:32:08,520
horizontal spectrum and just say I could
 

8847
02:32:08,520 --> 02:32:10,130
horizontal spectrum and just say I could
take your brain out of your head and I

8848
02:32:10,130 --> 02:32:10,140
take your brain out of your head and I
 

8849
02:32:10,140 --> 02:32:12,110
take your brain out of your head and I
put it on the thought pile right where

8850
02:32:12,110 --> 02:32:12,120
put it on the thought pile right where
 

8851
02:32:12,120 --> 02:32:14,510
put it on the thought pile right where
you happen to believe about that issue

8852
02:32:14,510 --> 02:32:14,520
you happen to believe about that issue
 

8853
02:32:14,520 --> 02:32:16,010
you happen to believe about that issue
now I did that for everyone in the in

8854
02:32:16,010 --> 02:32:16,020
now I did that for everyone in the in
 

8855
02:32:16,020 --> 02:32:17,929
now I did that for everyone in the in
the community or in a society and you're

8856
02:32:17,929 --> 02:32:17,939
the community or in a society and you're
 

8857
02:32:17,939 --> 02:32:19,250
the community or in a society and you're
going to end up with a big mushy pile

8858
02:32:19,250 --> 02:32:19,260
going to end up with a big mushy pile
 

8859
02:32:19,260 --> 02:32:20,990
going to end up with a big mushy pile
that I think will often form a bell

8860
02:32:20,990 --> 02:32:21,000
that I think will often form a bell
 

8861
02:32:21,000 --> 02:32:22,670
that I think will often form a bell
curve if it's really politicized it

8862
02:32:22,670 --> 02:32:22,680
curve if it's really politicized it
 

8863
02:32:22,680 --> 02:32:24,410
curve if it's really politicized it
might form like a camel with two humps

8864
02:32:24,410 --> 02:32:24,420
might form like a camel with two humps
 

8865
02:32:24,420 --> 02:32:25,969
might form like a camel with two humps
because it's like concentrated here but

8866
02:32:25,969 --> 02:32:25,979
because it's like concentrated here but
 

8867
02:32:25,979 --> 02:32:27,530
because it's like concentrated here but
for a typical issue it'll just form you

8868
02:32:27,530 --> 02:32:27,540
for a typical issue it'll just form you
 

8869
02:32:27,540 --> 02:32:29,450
for a typical issue it'll just form you
know a fear of AI you're going to have a

8870
02:32:29,450 --> 02:32:29,460
know a fear of AI you're going to have a
 

8871
02:32:29,460 --> 02:32:30,650
know a fear of AI you're going to have a
bell curve right you know things like

8872
02:32:30,650 --> 02:32:30,660
bell curve right you know things like
 

8873
02:32:30,660 --> 02:32:33,170
bell curve right you know things like
this that's the thought pile now the

8874
02:32:33,170 --> 02:32:33,180
this that's the thought pile now the
 

8875
02:32:33,180 --> 02:32:35,570
this that's the thought pile now the
second thing is a line that's I call the

8876
02:32:35,570 --> 02:32:35,580
second thing is a line that's I call the
 

8877
02:32:35,580 --> 02:32:37,130
second thing is a line that's I call the
speech curve which is what people are

8878
02:32:37,130 --> 02:32:37,140
speech curve which is what people are
 

8879
02:32:37,140 --> 02:32:38,870
speech curve which is what people are
saying so this feature curve is high

8880
02:32:38,870 --> 02:32:38,880
saying so this feature curve is high
 

8881
02:32:38,880 --> 02:32:40,610
saying so this feature curve is high
when not just a lot of people are saying

8882
02:32:40,610 --> 02:32:40,620
when not just a lot of people are saying
 

8883

fence over a part of this thought pile
 

8979
02:34:09,899 --> 02:34:11,389

8981
02:34:11,399 --> 02:34:13,670
and said no one's allowed to speak over
here the speech curve maybe people will

02:34:13,670 --> 02:34:13,680
here the speech curve maybe people will
 

8983
02:34:13,680 --> 02:34:14,929

9115
02:36:13,500 --> 02:36:15,650
chamber that they're now applying to
everyone and it's working and so the

9116
02:36:15,650 --> 02:36:15,660
everyone and it's working and so the
 

9117
02:36:15,660 --> 02:36:17,090
everyone and it's working and so the
speech curve distorts and so you end up

there wouldn't be all of these failings
 

9203
02:37:40,260 --> 02:37:41,690
there wouldn't be all of these failings
and by the way this is that's the immune

9204
02:37:41,690 --> 02:37:41,700
and by the way this is that's the immune
 

9205
02:37:41,700 --> 02:37:43,790
and by the way this is that's the immune
system failing that's the liberal immune

me down the humble tumble here and
 

9777
02:47:05,520 --> 02:47:07,429

9778
02:47:07,429 --> 02:47:07,439
number three it shoved me down where I
 

9779
02:47:07,439 --> 02:47:08,809
number three it shoved me down where I
started to and then I and then I went

9780
02:47:08,809 --> 02:47:08,819
started to and then I and then I went
 

9781
02:47:08,819 --> 02:47:10,130
started to and then I and then I went
the other way where I realized that I

9782
02:47:10,130 --> 02:47:10,140
the other way where I realized that I
 

9783
02:47:10,140 --> 02:47:12,050
the other way where I realized that I
had been a lot of my identity had been

9784
02:47:12,050 --> 02:47:12,060
had been a lot of my identity had been
 

9785
02:47:12,060 --> 02:47:14,630
had been a lot of my identity had been
based on this faux feeling of knowledge

9786
02:47:14,630 --> 02:47:14,640
based on this faux feeling of knowledge
 

9787
02:47:14,640 --> 02:47:16,429
based on this faux feeling of knowledge
this idea that I thought I knew

9788
02:47:16,429 --> 02:47:16,439
this idea that I thought I knew
 

9789
02:47:16,439 --> 02:47:18,170
this idea that I thought I knew
everything now that I don't have that I

9790
02:47:18,170 --> 02:47:18,180
everything now that I don't have that I
 

9791
02:47:18,180 --> 02:47:20,090
everything now that I don't have that I
was like I felt really like dumb and I

9792
02:47:20,090 --> 02:47:20,100
was like I felt really like dumb and I
 

9793
02:47:20,100 --> 02:47:21,770
was like I felt really like dumb and I
felt really almost like embarrassed of

02:47:21,770 --> 02:47:21,780
felt really almost like embarrassed of
 

9795
02:47:21,780 --> 02:47:23,450
felt really almost like embarrassed of
what I knew and so that's where I call

9796
02:47:23,450 --> 02:47:23,460
what I knew and so that's where I call
 

9797
02:47:23,460 --> 02:47:24,770
what I knew and so that's where I call
this insecure Canyon I think it's

sometimes when you're so used to
thinking you know everything and then

9802
02:47:27,110 --> 02:47:27,120
thinking you know everything and then

03:04:43,800 --> 03:04:45,410
for you right you're a hero you're
you're fighting fighting the good fight

10826
03:04:45,410 --> 03:04:45,420
you're fighting fighting the good fight
 

10827
03:04:45,420 --> 03:04:47,389
you're fighting fighting the good fight
so I think there's some disconnect here

10828
03:04:47,389 --> 03:04:47,399
so I think there's some disconnect here
 

10829
03:04:47,399 --> 03:04:49,130
so I think there's some disconnect here
and I think that if we can

10830
03:04:49,130 --> 03:04:49,140
and I think that if we can
 

10831
03:04:49,140 --> 03:04:50,870
and I think that if we can
get out of that Stockholm syndrome and

10832
03:04:50,870 --> 03:04:50,880
get out of that Stockholm syndrome and
 

10833
03:04:50,880 --> 03:04:52,969
get out of that Stockholm syndrome and
realize that death is just the machine

10834
03:04:52,969 --> 03:04:52,979
realize that death is just the machine
 

10835
03:04:52,979 --> 03:04:56,750
realize that death is just the machine
the human physical machine failing and

10836
03:04:56,750 --> 03:04:56,760
the human physical machine failing and
 

10837
03:04:56,760 --> 03:04:57,410
the human physical machine failing and
that

10838
03:04:57,410 --> 03:04:57,420
that
 

10839
03:04:57,420 --> 03:05:00,469
that
there's no law of nature that says you

10840
03:05:00,469 --> 03:05:00,479
there's no law of nature that says you
 

10841
03:05:00,479 --> 03:05:03,230
there's no law of nature that says you
can't with enough technology

10842
03:05:03,230 --> 03:05:03,240
can't with enough technology
 

10843
03:05:03,240 --> 03:05:05,510
can't with enough technology
um uh repair the machine and keep it

10844
03:05:05,510 --> 03:05:05,520
um uh repair the machine and keep it
 

10845
03:05:05,520 --> 03:05:07,429
um uh repair the machine and keep it
going until no one I don't think anyone

10846
03:05:07,429 --> 03:05:07,439
going until no one I don't think anyone
 

10847
03:05:07,439 --> 03:05:08,450
going until no one I don't think anyone
wants to live forever people think they

10848
03:05:08,450 --> 03:05:08,460
wants to live forever people think they
 

10849
03:05:08,460 --> 03:05:10,670
wants to live forever people think they
do no one does but until people are

10850
03:05:10,670 --> 03:05:10,680
do no one does but until people are
 

10851
03:05:10,680 --> 03:05:12,889
do no one does but until people are
ready and I think when we hit a world

10852
03:05:12,889 --> 03:05:12,899
ready and I think when we hit a world
 

10853
03:05:12,899 --> 03:05:15,650
ready and I think when we hit a world
where we can ex we have enough Tech that

10854
03:05:15,650 --> 03:05:15,660
where we can ex we have enough Tech that
 

10855
03:05:15,660 --> 03:05:17,870
where we can ex we have enough Tech that
we can continue to keep the human

10856
03:05:17,870 --> 03:05:17,880
we can continue to keep the human
 

10857
03:05:17,880 --> 03:05:19,610
we can continue to keep the human
machine alive until the person says I'm

10858
03:05:19,610 --> 03:05:19,620
machine alive until the person says I'm
 

10859
03:05:19,620 --> 03:05:21,830
machine alive until the person says I'm
done I'm ready I think we will look back

10860
03:05:21,830 --> 03:05:21,840
done I'm ready I think we will look back
 

10861
03:05:21,840 --> 03:05:23,389
done I'm ready I think we will look back
and we will think that anything before

10862
03:05:23,389 --> 03:05:23,399
and we will think that anything before
 

10863
03:05:23,399 --> 03:05:25,910
and we will think that anything before
that time that'll be the real A.D BC you

10864
03:05:25,910 --> 03:05:25,920
that time that'll be the real A.D BC you
 

10865
03:05:25,920 --> 03:05:28,190
that time that'll be the real A.D BC you
know we'll look back at BC before the

10866
03:05:28,190 --> 03:05:28,200
know we'll look back at BC before the
 

10867
03:05:28,200 --> 03:05:30,410
know we'll look back at BC before the
big advancement and it'll seem so sad

10868
03:05:30,410 --> 03:05:30,420
big advancement and it'll seem so sad
 

10869
03:05:30,420 --> 03:05:32,389
big advancement and it'll seem so sad
and so heartbreaking barbaric and people

10870
03:05:32,389 --> 03:05:32,399
and so heartbreaking barbaric and people
 

10871
03:05:32,399 --> 03:05:34,070
and so heartbreaking barbaric and people
will say I can't believe

10872
03:05:34,070 --> 03:05:34,080
will say I can't believe
 

10873
03:05:34,080 --> 03:05:36,050
will say I can't believe
that humans like us had to live with

10874
03:05:36,050 --> 03:05:36,060
that humans like us had to live with
 

10875
03:05:36,060 --> 03:05:37,370
that humans like us had to live with
that when they lost loved ones and they

10876
03:05:37,370 --> 03:05:37,380
that when they lost loved ones and they
 

10877
03:05:37,380 --> 03:05:39,710
that when they lost loved ones and they
they died before they were ready I think

10878
03:05:39,710 --> 03:05:39,720
they died before they were ready I think
 

10879
03:05:39,720 --> 03:05:41,929
they died before they were ready I think
that's the ultimate achievement but we

10880
03:05:41,929 --> 03:05:41,939
that's the ultimate achievement but we
 

10881
03:05:41,939 --> 03:05:43,809
that's the ultimate achievement but we
need to stop

10882
03:05:43,809 --> 03:05:43,819
need to stop
 

10883
03:05:43,819 --> 03:05:47,090
need to stop
criticizing and smearing people who you

10884
03:05:47,090 --> 03:05:47,100
criticizing and smearing people who you
 

10885
03:05:47,100 --> 03:05:48,889
criticizing and smearing people who you
talk about it so you think where that's

10886
03:05:48,889 --> 03:05:48,899
talk about it so you think where that's
 

10887
03:05:48,899 --> 03:05:50,570
talk about it so you think where that's
actually doable in the next two 250

10888
03:05:50,570 --> 03:05:50,580
actually doable in the next two 250

okay a lot happens in 250 years
