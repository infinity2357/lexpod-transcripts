he said if science is ever to fulfill

164
00:03:39,979 --> 00:03:39,989
he said if science is ever to fulfill
 

165
00:03:39,989 --> 00:03:44,390
he said if science is ever to fulfill
its mission the way art has done it must

166
00:03:44,390 --> 00:03:44,400
its mission the way art has done it must
 

167
00:03:44,400 --> 00:03:48,379
its mission the way art has done it must
penetrate its inner meaning must

00:03:48,389 --> 00:03:51,680
penetrate its inner meaning must
penetrate the consciousness of everyone

170
00:03:51,680 --> 00:03:51,690
penetrate the consciousness of everyone
 

171
00:03:51,690 --> 00:03:55,939
penetrate the consciousness of everyone
and so for me especially in a

172
00:03:55,939 --> 00:03:55,949
and so for me especially in a

civilization dependent on high
technology and science one that

176
00:04:01,250 --> 00:04:01,260
technology and science one that
 

177
00:04:01,260 --> 00:04:05,500
technology and science one that
spires to be democratic it's critical

178
00:04:05,500 --> 00:04:05,510
spires to be democratic it's critical
 

179
00:04:05,510 --> 00:04:10,309
spires to be democratic it's critical
that the public has informed decision

180
00:04:10,309 --> 00:04:10,319
that the public has informed decision

makers understand the values and the

182
00:04:13,610 --> 00:04:13,620
makers understand the values and the
 

183
00:04:13,620 --> 00:04:18,289
makers understand the values and the
methods and the rules of science so you

184
00:04:18,289 --> 00:04:18,299
methods and the rules of science so you
 

185
00:04:18,299 --> 00:04:21,140
methods and the rules of science so you
think about the what you just mentioned

186
00:04:21,140 --> 00:04:21,150
think about the what you just mentioned
 

187
00:04:21,150 --> 00:04:23,000
think about the what you just mentioned
the values and the methods and the rules

the values and the methods and the rules
 

189
00:04:23,010 --> 00:04:26,090
the values and the methods and the rules
and maybe the technology that science

190
00:04:26,090 --> 00:04:26,100
and maybe the technology that science
 

191
00:04:26,100 --> 00:04:29,180
and maybe the technology that science
produces but what about sort of the

192
00:04:29,180 --> 00:04:29,190
produces but what about sort of the
 

193
00:04:29,190 --> 00:04:32,150
produces but what about sort of the
beauty the mystery of science well that

194
00:04:32,150 --> 00:04:32,160
beauty the mystery of science well that
 

195
00:04:32,160 --> 00:04:34,400
beauty the mystery of science well that
you've touched on what I think is for me

196
00:04:34,400 --> 00:04:34,410
you've touched on what I think is for me
 

197
00:04:34,410 --> 00:04:37,310
you've touched on what I think is for me
that's how my way into science is that

198
00:04:37,310 --> 00:04:37,320
that's how my way into science is that
 

199
00:04:37,320 --> 00:04:40,490
that's how my way into science is that
for me it's much more spiritually

200
00:04:40,490 --> 00:04:40,500
for me it's much more spiritually
 

201
00:04:40,500 --> 00:04:43,400
for me it's much more spiritually
uplifting the revelations of science

202
00:04:43,400 --> 00:04:43,410
uplifting the revelations of science
 

203
00:04:43,410 --> 00:04:47,600
uplifting the revelations of science
collective revelations of you know

204
00:04:47,600 --> 00:04:47,610
collective revelations of you know
 

205
00:04:47,610 --> 00:04:50,570
collective revelations of you know
really countless generations of

206
00:04:50,570 --> 00:04:50,580
really countless generations of
 

207
00:04:50,580 --> 00:04:53,240
really countless generations of
searchers and a little tiny bit we know

208
00:04:53,240 --> 00:04:53,250
searchers and a little tiny bit we know
 

209
00:04:53,250 --> 00:04:56,090
searchers and a little tiny bit we know
about reality is the greatest joy from

210
00:04:56,090 --> 00:04:56,100
about reality is the greatest joy from
 

211
00:04:56,100 --> 00:05:00,950
about reality is the greatest joy from
me because I think it relates to the

212
00:05:00,950 --> 00:05:00,960
me because I think it relates to the
 

213
00:05:00,960 --> 00:05:04,040
me because I think it relates to the
idea of love like what is love that is

214
00:05:04,040 --> 00:05:04,050
idea of love like what is love that is
 

215
00:05:04,050 --> 00:05:07,520
idea of love like what is love that is
based on illusion about the other that's

216
00:05:07,520 --> 00:05:07,530
based on illusion about the other that's
 

217
00:05:07,530 --> 00:05:12,350
based on illusion about the other that's
not love love is seeing unflinching the

218
00:05:12,350 --> 00:05:12,360
not love love is seeing unflinching the
 

219
00:05:12,360 --> 00:05:15,529
not love love is seeing unflinching the
other and accepting with all your heart

220
00:05:15,529 --> 00:05:15,539
other and accepting with all your heart
 

221
00:05:15,539 --> 00:05:18,350
other and accepting with all your heart
and to me knowing the universe as it is

222
00:05:18,350 --> 00:05:18,360
and to me knowing the universe as it is
 

223
00:05:18,360 --> 00:05:20,659
and to me knowing the universe as it is
or the little bit that we're able to

224
00:05:20,659 --> 00:05:20,669
or the little bit that we're able to
 

225
00:05:20,669 --> 00:05:23,870
or the little bit that we're able to
understand at this point is like is the

226
00:05:23,870 --> 00:05:23,880
understand at this point is like is the
 

227
00:05:23,880 --> 00:05:26,719
understand at this point is like is the
purest kind of love and therefore you

228
00:05:26,719 --> 00:05:26,729
purest kind of love and therefore you
 

229
00:05:26,729 --> 00:05:29,629
purest kind of love and therefore you
know how can our philosophy our religion

230
00:05:29,629 --> 00:05:29,639
know how can our philosophy our religion
 

231
00:05:29,639 --> 00:05:33,230
know how can our philosophy our religion
if it's real isn't nature how can it

232
00:05:33,230 --> 00:05:33,240
if it's real isn't nature how can it
 

233
00:05:33,240 --> 00:05:36,589
if it's real isn't nature how can it
really be true I just don't understand

234
00:05:36,589 --> 00:05:36,599
really be true I just don't understand
 

235
00:05:36,599 --> 00:05:40,700
really be true I just don't understand
so I think you need science to get a

236
00:05:40,700 --> 00:05:40,710
so I think you need science to get a
 

237
00:05:40,710 --> 00:05:45,320
so I think you need science to get a
sense of the real romance of life and

238
00:05:45,320 --> 00:05:45,330
sense of the real romance of life and
 

239
00:05:45,330 --> 00:05:49,070
sense of the real romance of life and
the great experience of being awake in

240
00:05:49,070 --> 00:05:49,080
the great experience of being awake in
 

241
00:05:49,080 --> 00:05:52,279
the great experience of being awake in
the cosmos so that the fact that we know

242
00:05:52,279 --> 00:05:52,289
the cosmos so that the fact that we know
 

243
00:05:52,289 --> 00:05:55,219
the cosmos so that the fact that we know
so little the the humbling nature of

244
00:05:55,219 --> 00:05:55,229
so little the the humbling nature of
 

245
00:05:55,229 --> 00:05:58,939
so little the the humbling nature of
that so and you kind of connect the love

246
00:05:58,939 --> 00:05:58,949
that so and you kind of connect the love
 

247
00:05:58,949 --> 00:06:02,089
that so and you kind of connect the love
to that but isn't it also isn't it scary

248
00:06:02,089 --> 00:06:02,099
to that but isn't it also isn't it scary
 

249
00:06:02,099 --> 00:06:06,260
to that but isn't it also isn't it scary
isn't it why is it so inspiring do you

250
00:06:06,260 --> 00:06:06,270
isn't it why is it so inspiring do you
 

251
00:06:06,270 --> 00:06:08,540
isn't it why is it so inspiring do you
think why is it so beautiful that we

252
00:06:08,540 --> 00:06:08,550
think why is it so beautiful that we
 

253
00:06:08,550 --> 00:06:10,480
think why is it so beautiful that we
know so little

254
00:06:10,480 --> 00:06:10,490
know so little
 

255
00:06:10,490 --> 00:06:13,399
know so little
well first of all as Socrates thought

256
00:06:13,399 --> 00:06:13,409
well first of all as Socrates thought
 

257
00:06:13,409 --> 00:06:15,110
well first of all as Socrates thought
you know knowing that you know

258
00:06:15,110 --> 00:06:15,120
you know knowing that you know
 

259
00:06:15,120 --> 00:06:17,480
you know knowing that you know
is knowing really knowing something

260
00:06:17,480 --> 00:06:17,490
is knowing really knowing something
 

261
00:06:17,490 --> 00:06:20,560
is knowing really knowing something
knowing more than others and it's the

262
00:06:20,560 --> 00:06:20,570
knowing more than others and it's the
 

263
00:06:20,570 --> 00:06:23,450
knowing more than others and it's the
it's that voice whispering in our our

264
00:06:23,450 --> 00:06:23,460
it's that voice whispering in our our
 

265
00:06:23,460 --> 00:06:26,510
it's that voice whispering in our our
heads you know you might be wrong which

266
00:06:26,510 --> 00:06:26,520
heads you know you might be wrong which
 

267
00:06:26,520 --> 00:06:29,480
heads you know you might be wrong which
i think is not only it's really healthy

268
00:06:29,480 --> 00:06:29,490
i think is not only it's really healthy
 

269
00:06:29,490 --> 00:06:31,640
i think is not only it's really healthy
because we're so imperfect we're human

270
00:06:31,640 --> 00:06:31,650
because we're so imperfect we're human
 

271
00:06:31,650 --> 00:06:35,030
because we're so imperfect we're human
of course but also you know love to me

272
00:06:35,030 --> 00:06:35,040
of course but also you know love to me
 

273
00:06:35,040 --> 00:06:36,860
of course but also you know love to me
is the feeling that you always want to

274
00:06:36,860 --> 00:06:36,870
is the feeling that you always want to
 

275
00:06:36,870 --> 00:06:40,000
is the feeling that you always want to
go deeper get closer you can't get

276
00:06:40,000 --> 00:06:40,010
go deeper get closer you can't get
 

277
00:06:40,010 --> 00:06:43,070
go deeper get closer you can't get
enough of it you can't get close enough

278
00:06:43,070 --> 00:06:43,080
enough of it you can't get close enough
 

279
00:06:43,080 --> 00:06:46,340
enough of it you can't get close enough
deep enough so and that's what science

280
00:06:46,340 --> 00:06:46,350
deep enough so and that's what science
 

281
00:06:46,350 --> 00:06:47,840
deep enough so and that's what science
is always saying as science is never

282
00:06:47,840 --> 00:06:47,850
is always saying as science is never
 

283
00:06:47,850 --> 00:06:51,020
is always saying as science is never
simply content with its understanding of

284
00:06:51,020 --> 00:06:51,030
simply content with its understanding of
 

285
00:06:51,030 --> 00:06:54,350
simply content with its understanding of
any aspect of nature it's always saying

286
00:06:54,350 --> 00:06:54,360
any aspect of nature it's always saying
 

287
00:06:54,360 --> 00:06:57,310
any aspect of nature it's always saying
it's always finding that even smaller

288
00:06:57,310 --> 00:06:57,320
it's always finding that even smaller
 

289
00:06:57,320 --> 00:07:02,240
it's always finding that even smaller
cosmos beneath so I I think the two are

290
00:07:02,240 --> 00:07:02,250
cosmos beneath so I I think the two are
 

291
00:07:02,250 --> 00:07:06,740
cosmos beneath so I I think the two are
very much parallel so you said that love

292
00:07:06,740 --> 00:07:06,750
very much parallel so you said that love
 

293
00:07:06,750 --> 00:07:10,760
very much parallel so you said that love
is not an illusion no it's not well what

294
00:07:10,760 --> 00:07:10,770
is not an illusion no it's not well what
 

295
00:07:10,770 --> 00:07:15,050
is not an illusion no it's not well what
is love what is love is is knowing for

296
00:07:15,050 --> 00:07:15,060
is love what is love is is knowing for
 

297
00:07:15,060 --> 00:07:17,960
is love what is love is is knowing for
me love is is knowing something deeply

298
00:07:17,960 --> 00:07:17,970
me love is is knowing something deeply
 

299
00:07:17,970 --> 00:07:25,310
me love is is knowing something deeply
and still being completely gratified by

300
00:07:25,310 --> 00:07:25,320
and still being completely gratified by
 

301
00:07:25,320 --> 00:07:28,430
and still being completely gratified by
it you know and wanting to know more so

302
00:07:28,430 --> 00:07:28,440
it you know and wanting to know more so
 

303
00:07:28,440 --> 00:07:32,719
it you know and wanting to know more so
what is love what is loving someone a

304
00:07:32,719 --> 00:07:32,729
what is love what is loving someone a
 

305
00:07:32,729 --> 00:07:37,250
what is love what is loving someone a
person let's say deeply is not

306
00:07:37,250 --> 00:07:37,260
person let's say deeply is not
 

307
00:07:37,260 --> 00:07:41,980

idealizing them not putting some kind of

308
00:07:41,980 --> 00:07:41,990
idealizing them not putting some kind of
 

309
00:07:41,990 --> 00:07:47,210
idealizing them not putting some kind of
subjective projection on them but

310
00:07:47,210 --> 00:07:47,220
subjective projection on them but
 

311
00:07:47,220 --> 00:07:49,310
subjective projection on them but
knowing them as they are and so for me

312
00:07:49,310 --> 00:07:49,320
knowing them as they are and so for me
 

313
00:07:49,320 --> 00:07:52,640
knowing them as they are and so for me
for me the only aperture to that knowing

314
00:07:52,640 --> 00:07:52,650
for me the only aperture to that knowing
 

315
00:07:52,650 --> 00:07:54,230
for me the only aperture to that knowing
about nature the universe

316
00:07:54,230 --> 00:07:54,240
about nature the universe
 

317
00:07:54,240 --> 00:07:56,570
about nature the universe
it's science because it has that error

318
00:07:56,570 --> 00:07:56,580
it's science because it has that error
 

319
00:07:56,580 --> 00:07:59,870
it's science because it has that error
correcting mechanism that most of the

shuts it down sometimes a little bit
yeah I mean I think it's up to the

408
00:10:04,530 --> 00:10:04,540
yeah I mean I think it's up to the
 

409
00:10:04,540 --> 00:10:07,400
yeah I mean I think it's up to the
individual but for me no I was so

00:10:07,400 --> 00:10:07,410
individual but for me no I was so
 

411
00:10:07,410 --> 00:10:10,740
individual but for me no I was so
ridiculously fortunate and that I my

412
00:10:10,740 --> 00:10:10,750
ridiculously fortunate and that I my
 

413
00:10:10,750 --> 00:10:12,480
ridiculously fortunate and that I my
tutorial in science because I'm not a

414
00:10:12,480 --> 00:10:12,490
tutorial in science because I'm not a
 

415
00:10:12,490 --> 00:10:14,250
tutorial in science because I'm not a
scientist and I wasn't trained in

416
00:10:14,250 --> 00:10:14,260
scientist and I wasn't trained in
 

417
00:10:14,260 --> 00:10:18,120
scientist and I wasn't trained in
science was 20 years of days and nights

418
00:10:18,120 --> 00:10:18,130
science was 20 years of days and nights
 

419
00:10:18,130 --> 00:10:21,329
science was 20 years of days and nights
with Carl Sagan and the Wonder I think

420
00:10:21,329 --> 00:10:21,339
with Carl Sagan and the Wonder I think
 

421
00:10:21,339 --> 00:10:24,360
with Carl Sagan and the Wonder I think
the reason Carl remains so beloved well

422
00:10:24,360 --> 00:10:24,370
the reason Carl remains so beloved well
 

423
00:10:24,370 --> 00:10:26,700
the reason Carl remains so beloved well
I think there are many reasons but at

424
00:10:26,700 --> 00:10:26,710
I think there are many reasons but at
 

425
00:10:26,710 --> 00:10:30,060
I think there are many reasons but at
the root of it is the fact that his

426
00:10:30,060 --> 00:10:30,070
the root of it is the fact that his
 

427
00:10:30,070 --> 00:10:32,880
the root of it is the fact that his
skepticism was never at the cost of his

428
00:10:32,880 --> 00:10:32,890
skepticism was never at the cost of his
 

429
00:10:32,890 --> 00:10:35,820
skepticism was never at the cost of his
Wonder and his Wonder was never at the

430
00:10:35,820 --> 00:10:35,830
Wonder and his Wonder was never at the
 

431
00:10:35,830 --> 00:10:38,940
Wonder and his Wonder was never at the
cost of his skepticism so he couldn't

432
00:10:38,940 --> 00:10:38,950
cost of his skepticism so he couldn't
 

433
00:10:38,950 --> 00:10:41,280
cost of his skepticism so he couldn't
fool himself into believing something he

434
00:10:41,280 --> 00:10:41,290
fool himself into believing something he
 

435
00:10:41,290 --> 00:10:42,350
fool himself into believing something he
wanted to believe

436
00:10:42,350 --> 00:10:42,360
wanted to believe
 

437
00:10:42,360 --> 00:10:44,720
wanted to believe
because it made him feel good at the

438
00:10:44,720 --> 00:10:44,730
because it made him feel good at the
 

439
00:10:44,730 --> 00:10:46,670
because it made him feel good at the
other but on the other hand he

440
00:10:46,670 --> 00:10:46,680
other but on the other hand he
 

441
00:10:46,680 --> 00:10:50,060
other but on the other hand he
recognized that what science what nature

442
00:10:50,060 --> 00:10:50,070
recognized that what science what nature
 

443
00:10:50,070 --> 00:10:53,630
recognized that what science what nature
is it's really it's good enough you know

444
00:10:53,630 --> 00:10:53,640
is it's really it's good enough you know
 

445
00:10:53,640 --> 00:10:57,110
is it's really it's good enough you know
it's way better than our fantasies yeah

446
00:10:57,110 --> 00:10:57,120
it's way better than our fantasies yeah
 

447
00:10:57,120 --> 00:10:59,630
it's way better than our fantasies yeah
and so if you if you're that kind of

448
00:10:59,630 --> 00:10:59,640
and so if you if you're that kind of
 

449
00:10:59,640 --> 00:11:03,139
and so if you if you're that kind of
person who loves happiness loves life

450
00:11:03,139 --> 00:11:03,149
person who loves happiness loves life
 

451
00:11:03,149 --> 00:11:06,019
person who loves happiness loves life
and your eyes are wide open and you read

452
00:11:06,019 --> 00:11:06,029
and your eyes are wide open and you read
 

453
00:11:06,029 --> 00:11:07,940
and your eyes are wide open and you read
everything you can get your hands on and

454
00:11:07,940 --> 00:11:07,950
everything you can get your hands on and
 

455
00:11:07,950 --> 00:11:10,940
everything you can get your hands on and
you spend years studying what is known

456
00:11:10,940 --> 00:11:10,950
you spend years studying what is known
 

457
00:11:10,950 --> 00:11:15,470
you spend years studying what is known
so far about the universe then you have

458
00:11:15,470 --> 00:11:15,480
so far about the universe then you have
 

459
00:11:15,480 --> 00:11:19,030
so far about the universe then you have
that capacity a really infinite capacity

460
00:11:19,030 --> 00:11:19,040
that capacity a really infinite capacity
 

461
00:11:19,040 --> 00:11:23,600
that capacity a really infinite capacity
to be alive but all and also at the same

462
00:11:23,600 --> 00:11:23,610
to be alive but all and also at the same
 

463
00:11:23,610 --> 00:11:27,500
to be alive but all and also at the same
time to be very rigorous about what

464
00:11:27,500 --> 00:11:27,510
time to be very rigorous about what
 

465
00:11:27,510 --> 00:11:30,259
time to be very rigorous about what
you're willing to believe for Carl I

466
00:11:30,259 --> 00:11:30,269
you're willing to believe for Carl I
 

467
00:11:30,269 --> 00:11:33,470
you're willing to believe for Carl I
don't think he ever felt that his

468
00:11:33,470 --> 00:11:33,480
don't think he ever felt that his
 

469
00:11:33,480 --> 00:11:35,990
don't think he ever felt that his
skepticism cost him anything because

470
00:11:35,990 --> 00:11:36,000
skepticism cost him anything because
 

471
00:11:36,000 --> 00:11:38,269
skepticism cost him anything because
again it comes back to luck he wanted to

472
00:11:38,269 --> 00:11:38,279
again it comes back to luck he wanted to
 

473
00:11:38,279 --> 00:11:41,690
again it comes back to luck he wanted to
know when HM really was like not to

474
00:11:41,690 --> 00:11:41,700
know when HM really was like not to
 

475
00:11:41,700 --> 00:11:44,360
know when HM really was like not to
inflict his you know preconceived

00:11:44,360 --> 00:11:44,370
inflict his you know preconceived
 

477

notions on what he wanted it to be so

478
00:11:46,639 --> 00:11:46,649
notions on what he wanted it to be so
 

479
00:11:46,649 --> 00:11:49,639
notions on what he wanted it to be so
you can't go wrong because it doesn't

480
00:11:49,639 --> 00:11:49,649
you can't go wrong because it doesn't
 

481
00:11:49,649 --> 00:11:51,590
you can't go wrong because it doesn't
you know I mean you know I think the

00:11:54,380 --> 00:11:54,390
pale blue dot is that is a perfect
 

485
00:11:54,390 --> 00:11:58,400
pale blue dot is that is a perfect
example of this of his massive

00:11:58,400 --> 00:11:58,410
example of this of his massive
 

487
00:11:58,410 --> 00:12:02,030
example of this of his massive
achievement is to say ok or the Voyager

record is another example is here we

490
00:12:04,730 --> 00:12:04,740
record is another example is here we
 

491
00:12:04,740 --> 00:12:06,050
record is another example is here we
have this mission our first

492
00:12:06,050 --> 00:12:06,060
have this mission our first
 

493
00:12:06,060 --> 00:12:08,680
have this mission our first
reconnaissance of the outer solar system

494
00:12:08,680 --> 00:12:08,690
reconnaissance of the outer solar system
 

495
00:12:08,690 --> 00:12:12,680
reconnaissance of the outer solar system
well how can we make it a mission in

496
00:12:12,680 --> 00:12:12,690
well how can we make it a mission in
 

497
00:12:12,690 --> 00:12:16,220
well how can we make it a mission in
which we absolutely squeeze every drop

498
00:12:16,220 --> 00:12:16,230
which we absolutely squeeze every drop
 

499
00:12:16,230 --> 00:12:21,019
which we absolutely squeeze every drop
of consciousness and understanding from

500
00:12:21,019 --> 00:12:21,029
of consciousness and understanding from
 

501
00:12:21,029 --> 00:12:23,689
of consciousness and understanding from
it we don't have to be scientists and

502
00:12:23,689 --> 00:12:23,699
it we don't have to be scientists and
 

503
00:12:23,699 --> 00:12:26,780
it we don't have to be scientists and
then be human beings I think that's the

504
00:12:26,780 --> 00:12:26,790
then be human beings I think that's the
 

505
00:12:26,790 --> 00:12:30,370
then be human beings I think that's the
tragedy of Western civilization is that

506
00:12:30,370 --> 00:12:30,380
tragedy of Western civilization is that
 

507
00:12:30,380 --> 00:12:33,079
tragedy of Western civilization is that
it's you know when it's one of its

508
00:12:33,079 --> 00:12:33,089
it's you know when it's one of its
 

509
00:12:33,089 --> 00:12:37,040
it's you know when it's one of its
greatest gifts it has been science and

510
00:12:37,040 --> 00:12:37,050
greatest gifts it has been science and
 

511
00:12:37,050 --> 00:12:41,780
greatest gifts it has been science and
yet at the same time it believing that

512
00:12:41,780 --> 00:12:41,790
yet at the same time it believing that
 

513
00:12:41,790 --> 00:12:44,210
yet at the same time it believing that
we are the children of a disappointed

514
00:12:44,210 --> 00:12:44,220
we are the children of a disappointed
 

515
00:12:44,220 --> 00:12:48,050
we are the children of a disappointed
father a tyrant who puts us in a

00:12:48,050 --> 00:12:48,060
father a tyrant who puts us in a
 

517
00:12:48,060 --> 00:12:50,990
father a tyrant who puts us in a
maximum-security prison and calls it

518
00:12:50,990 --> 00:12:51,000
maximum-security prison and calls it
 

519
00:12:51,000 --> 00:12:53,689
maximum-security prison and calls it
paradise who looks at us who watches us

520
00:12:53,689 --> 00:12:53,699
paradise who looks at us who watches us
 

521
00:12:53,699 --> 00:12:56,390
paradise who looks at us who watches us
every moment and hates us for

522
00:12:56,390 --> 00:12:56,400
every moment and hates us for
 

523
00:12:56,400 --> 00:13:00,320
every moment and hates us for
being our human selves you know and then

524
00:13:00,320 --> 00:13:00,330
being our human selves you know and then
 

525
00:13:00,330 --> 00:13:03,019
being our human selves you know and then
most of all what is our great sin its

526
00:13:03,019 --> 00:13:03,029
most of all what is our great sin its
 

527
00:13:03,029 --> 00:13:06,200
most of all what is our great sin its
partaking of the tree of knowledge which

528
00:13:06,200 --> 00:13:06,210
partaking of the tree of knowledge which
 

529
00:13:06,210 --> 00:13:09,530
partaking of the tree of knowledge which
is our greatest gift as humans this

530
00:13:09,530 --> 00:13:09,540
is our greatest gift as humans this
 

531
00:13:09,540 --> 00:13:14,269
is our greatest gift as humans this
pattern recognition this ability to to

532
00:13:14,269 --> 00:13:14,279
pattern recognition this ability to to
 

533
00:13:14,279 --> 00:13:17,390
pattern recognition this ability to to
see things and then synthesize them and

534
00:13:17,390 --> 00:13:17,400
see things and then synthesize them and
 

535
00:13:17,400 --> 00:13:19,370
see things and then synthesize them and
jump to conclusions about them and test

536
00:13:19,370 --> 00:13:19,380
jump to conclusions about them and test
 

537
00:13:19,380 --> 00:13:23,000
jump to conclusions about them and test
those conclusions so I think the reason

538
00:13:23,000 --> 00:13:23,010
those conclusions so I think the reason
 

539
00:13:23,010 --> 00:13:26,510
those conclusions so I think the reason
that in literature in movies the

540
00:13:26,510 --> 00:13:26,520
that in literature in movies the
 

541
00:13:26,520 --> 00:13:31,090
that in literature in movies the
scientist is a figure of alienation a

542
00:13:31,090 --> 00:13:31,100
scientist is a figure of alienation a
 

543
00:13:31,100 --> 00:13:34,790
scientist is a figure of alienation a
figure you know oh you see these biopics

544
00:13:34,790 --> 00:13:34,800
figure you know oh you see these biopics
 

545
00:13:34,800 --> 00:13:37,579
figure you know oh you see these biopics
about scientists and yeah he might have

546
00:13:37,579 --> 00:13:37,589
about scientists and yeah he might have
 

547
00:13:37,589 --> 00:13:40,700
about scientists and yeah he might have
been great but you know he was missing

548
00:13:40,700 --> 00:13:40,710
been great but you know he was missing
 

549
00:13:40,710 --> 00:13:43,760
been great but you know he was missing
and ship you know he was a lousy husband

550
00:13:43,760 --> 00:13:43,770
and ship you know he was a lousy husband
 

551
00:13:43,770 --> 00:13:47,630
and ship you know he was a lousy husband
he lacked you know the kind of spiritual

552
00:13:47,630 --> 00:13:47,640
he lacked you know the kind of spiritual
 

553
00:13:47,640 --> 00:13:51,950
he lacked you know the kind of spiritual
understanding that maybe you know his

554
00:13:51,950 --> 00:13:51,960
understanding that maybe you know his
 

555
00:13:51,960 --> 00:13:55,130
understanding that maybe you know his
wife had and it's always in the end they

556
00:13:55,130 --> 00:13:55,140
wife had and it's always in the end they
 

557
00:13:55,140 --> 00:13:57,800
wife had and it's always in the end they
come around but to me that's that's a

558
00:13:57,800 --> 00:13:57,810
come around but to me that's that's a
 

559
00:13:57,810 --> 00:14:01,160
come around but to me that's that's a
false dichotomy that we are you know to

560
00:14:01,160 --> 00:14:01,170
false dichotomy that we are you know to
 

561
00:14:01,170 --> 00:14:03,560
false dichotomy that we are you know to
the extent that we are aware of our

562
00:14:03,560 --> 00:14:03,570
the extent that we are aware of our
 

563
00:14:03,570 --> 00:14:05,570
the extent that we are aware of our
surroundings and understand them which

564
00:14:05,570 --> 00:14:05,580
surroundings and understand them which
 

565
00:14:05,580 --> 00:14:07,519
surroundings and understand them which
is what science makes it possible for us

566
00:14:07,519 --> 00:14:07,529
is what science makes it possible for us
 

567
00:14:07,529 --> 00:14:11,300
is what science makes it possible for us
to do we're even more alive so you

568
00:14:11,300 --> 00:14:11,310
to do we're even more alive so you
 

569
00:14:11,310 --> 00:14:13,670
to do we're even more alive so you
mentioned a million awesome things there

570
00:14:13,670 --> 00:14:13,680
mentioned a million awesome things there
 

571
00:14:13,680 --> 00:14:16,040
mentioned a million awesome things there
let's even just can you tell me about

572
00:14:16,040 --> 00:14:16,050
let's even just can you tell me about
 

573
00:14:16,050 --> 00:14:18,350
let's even just can you tell me about
the Voyager 1 and 2 spacecraft and the

574
00:14:18,350 --> 00:14:18,360
the Voyager 1 and 2 spacecraft and the

and the interstellar message project and
 

577
00:14:22,080 --> 00:14:23,810
and the interstellar message project and
that whole just fascinating world

00:14:23,810 --> 00:14:23,820
that whole just fascinating world
 

579
00:14:23,820 --> 00:14:25,490
that whole just fascinating world
leading up to one of my favorite

580
00:14:25,490 --> 00:14:25,500
leading up to one of my favorite
 

581
00:14:25,500 --> 00:14:27,560
leading up to one of my favorite
subjects I love talking about it I'll

582
00:14:27,560 --> 00:14:27,570
subjects I love talking about it I'll
 

583
00:14:27,570 --> 00:14:28,550
subjects I love talking about it I'll
never get over it

584
00:14:28,550 --> 00:14:28,560
never get over it
 

585
00:14:28,560 --> 00:14:31,340
never get over it
yeah I'll never be able to really wrap

586
00:14:31,340 --> 00:14:31,350
yeah I'll never be able to really wrap
 

587
00:14:31,350 --> 00:14:34,340
yeah I'll never be able to really wrap
my head around the the reality of it the

588
00:14:34,340 --> 00:14:34,350
my head around the the reality of it the
 

589
00:14:34,350 --> 00:14:36,320
my head around the the reality of it the
truth of it what is it for so what's the

590
00:14:36,320 --> 00:14:36,330
truth of it what is it for so what's the
 

591
00:14:36,330 --> 00:14:37,430
truth of it what is it for so what's the
Voyager spacecraft

592
00:14:37,430 --> 00:14:37,440
Voyager spacecraft
 

593
00:14:37,440 --> 00:14:41,350
Voyager spacecraft
okay so voyagers 1 & 2 where our first

594
00:14:41,350 --> 00:14:41,360
okay so voyagers 1 & 2 where our first
 

595
00:14:41,360 --> 00:14:43,790
okay so voyagers 1 & 2 where our first
reconnaissance mission of what was then

596
00:14:43,790 --> 00:14:43,800
reconnaissance mission of what was then
 

597
00:14:43,800 --> 00:14:47,570
reconnaissance mission of what was then
considered the outer solar system and it

598
00:14:47,570 --> 00:14:47,580
considered the outer solar system and it
 

599
00:14:47,580 --> 00:14:50,900
considered the outer solar system and it
was a gift of gravity the idea that

600
00:14:50,900 --> 00:14:50,910
was a gift of gravity the idea that
 

601
00:14:50,910 --> 00:14:54,890
was a gift of gravity the idea that
swinging around these worlds gives you a

602
00:14:54,890 --> 00:14:54,900
swinging around these worlds gives you a
 

603
00:14:54,900 --> 00:14:57,050
swinging around these worlds gives you a
gravitational assist yes

604
00:14:57,050 --> 00:14:57,060
gravitational assist yes
 

605
00:14:57,060 --> 00:15:00,140
gravitational assist yes
which ultimately will send you out of

606
00:15:00,140 --> 00:15:00,150
which ultimately will send you out of
 

607
00:15:00,150 --> 00:15:02,810
which ultimately will send you out of
the solar system to wander the Milky Way

608
00:15:02,810 --> 00:15:02,820
the solar system to wander the Milky Way
 

609
00:15:02,820 --> 00:15:08,030
the solar system to wander the Milky Way
galaxy for one to five billion years so

610
00:15:08,030 --> 00:15:08,040
galaxy for one to five billion years so
 

611
00:15:08,040 --> 00:15:10,070
galaxy for one to five billion years so
Voyager gave us our

612
00:15:10,070 --> 00:15:10,080
Voyager gave us our
 

613
00:15:10,080 --> 00:15:14,840
Voyager gave us our
first close-up look of Jupiter Saturn

614
00:15:14,840 --> 00:15:14,850
first close-up look of Jupiter Saturn
 

615
00:15:14,850 --> 00:15:21,110
first close-up look of Jupiter Saturn
Uranus Neptune it's discovered new moons

616
00:15:21,110 --> 00:15:21,120
Uranus Neptune it's discovered new moons
 

617
00:15:21,120 --> 00:15:28,340
Uranus Neptune it's discovered new moons
it discovered volcanoes on Io it it its

618
00:15:28,340 --> 00:15:28,350
it discovered volcanoes on Io it it its
 

619
00:15:28,350 --> 00:15:31,370
it discovered volcanoes on Io it it its
achievements are astonishing and

620
00:15:31,370 --> 00:15:31,380
achievements are astonishing and
 

621
00:15:31,380 --> 00:15:34,070
achievements are astonishing and
remember this is technology from the

622
00:15:34,070 --> 00:15:34,080
remember this is technology from the
 

623
00:15:34,080 --> 00:15:38,300
remember this is technology from the
early to mid-1970s and it's still active

624
00:15:38,300 --> 00:15:38,310
early to mid-1970s and it's still active
 

625
00:15:38,310 --> 00:15:39,770
early to mid-1970s and it's still active
and it's still active we talked to

626
00:15:39,770 --> 00:15:39,780
and it's still active we talked to
 

627
00:15:39,780 --> 00:15:43,070
and it's still active we talked to
Voyager a few days ago we talked to it

628
00:15:43,070 --> 00:15:43,080
Voyager a few days ago we talked to it
 

629
00:15:43,080 --> 00:15:46,460
Voyager a few days ago we talked to it
in fact a year ago I think it was we

630
00:15:46,460 --> 00:15:46,470
in fact a year ago I think it was we
 

631
00:15:46,470 --> 00:15:49,310
in fact a year ago I think it was we
needed to slightly change the attitude

632
00:15:49,310 --> 00:15:49,320
needed to slightly change the attitude
 

633
00:15:49,320 --> 00:15:52,190
needed to slightly change the attitude
of the spacecraft and so we fired up its

634
00:15:52,190 --> 00:15:52,200
of the spacecraft and so we fired up its
 

635
00:15:52,200 --> 00:15:56,030
of the spacecraft and so we fired up its
thrusters for the first time since 1987

636
00:15:56,030 --> 00:15:56,040
thrusters for the first time since 1987
 

637
00:15:56,040 --> 00:15:59,300
thrusters for the first time since 1987
do they work instantly they it was as if

638
00:15:59,300 --> 00:15:59,310
do they work instantly they it was as if
 

639
00:15:59,310 --> 00:16:01,220
do they work instantly they it was as if
you had left your car in the garage

640
00:16:01,220 --> 00:16:01,230
you had left your car in the garage
 

641
00:16:01,230 --> 00:16:05,210
you had left your car in the garage
in 1987 yeah and you could key in the

642
00:16:05,210 --> 00:16:05,220
in 1987 yeah and you could key in the
 

643
00:16:05,220 --> 00:16:07,190
in 1987 yeah and you could key in the
ignition because you use keys then in

644
00:16:07,190 --> 00:16:07,200
ignition because you use keys then in
 

645
00:16:07,200 --> 00:16:10,010
ignition because you use keys then in
the ignition and it turned over the

646
00:16:10,010 --> 00:16:10,020
the ignition and it turned over the
 

647
00:16:10,020 --> 00:16:12,770
the ignition and it turned over the
first time you stepped on the gas and so

648
00:16:12,770 --> 00:16:12,780
first time you stepped on the gas and so
 

649
00:16:12,780 --> 00:16:14,690
first time you stepped on the gas and so
that's the genius of the engineering

650
00:16:14,690 --> 00:16:14,700
that's the genius of the engineering
 

651
00:16:14,700 --> 00:16:19,000
that's the genius of the engineering
yeah a Voyager and Carl was one of the

652
00:16:19,000 --> 00:16:19,010
yeah a Voyager and Carl was one of the
 

653
00:16:19,010 --> 00:16:24,770
yeah a Voyager and Carl was one of the
key participants in in in imagining what

654
00:16:24,770 --> 00:16:24,780
key participants in in in imagining what
 

655
00:16:24,780 --> 00:16:26,840
key participants in in in imagining what
its mission would be because it was a a

656
00:16:26,840 --> 00:16:26,850
its mission would be because it was a a
 

657
00:16:26,850 --> 00:16:30,950
its mission would be because it was a a
gift actually of the fact that every

658
00:16:30,950 --> 00:16:30,960
gift actually of the fact that every
 

659
00:16:30,960 --> 00:16:34,790
gift actually of the fact that every
hundred and 75 years plus or minus there

660
00:16:34,790 --> 00:16:34,800
hundred and 75 years plus or minus there
 

661
00:16:34,800 --> 00:16:37,250
hundred and 75 years plus or minus there
is an alignment of the worlds and so you

662
00:16:37,250 --> 00:16:37,260
is an alignment of the worlds and so you
 

663
00:16:37,260 --> 00:16:40,820
is an alignment of the worlds and so you
can't send two spacecraft to these are

664
00:16:40,820 --> 00:16:40,830
can't send two spacecraft to these are
 

665
00:16:40,830 --> 00:16:44,720
can't send two spacecraft to these are
the worlds and photograph them and use

666
00:16:44,720 --> 00:16:44,730
the worlds and photograph them and use
 

667
00:16:44,730 --> 00:16:46,960
the worlds and photograph them and use
your mass spectrometer and all the other

668
00:16:46,960 --> 00:16:46,970
your mass spectrometer and all the other
 

669
00:16:46,970 --> 00:16:52,100
your mass spectrometer and all the other
devices unvoyage ER to to really to

670
00:16:52,100 --> 00:16:52,110
devices unvoyage ER to to really to
 

671
00:16:52,110 --> 00:16:54,410
devices unvoyage ER to to really to
explore these worlds and it's the

672
00:16:54,410 --> 00:16:54,420
explore these worlds and it's the
 

673
00:16:54,420 --> 00:16:56,900
explore these worlds and it's the
farthest spacecraft is the farthest

674
00:16:56,900 --> 00:16:56,910
farthest spacecraft is the farthest
 

675
00:16:56,910 --> 00:17:00,890
farthest spacecraft is the farthest
human creation away from us today where

676
00:17:00,890 --> 00:17:00,900
human creation away from us today where
 

677
00:17:00,900 --> 00:17:03,230
human creation away from us today where
is your one where's your one these two

678
00:17:03,230 --> 00:17:03,240
is your one where's your one these two
 

679
00:17:03,240 --> 00:17:05,570
is your one where's your one these two
spacecraft not only gave us a our first

680
00:17:05,570 --> 00:17:05,580
spacecraft not only gave us a our first
 

681
00:17:05,580 --> 00:17:08,750
spacecraft not only gave us a our first
close-up look hundreds of moons and

682
00:17:08,750 --> 00:17:08,760
close-up look hundreds of moons and
 

683
00:17:08,760 --> 00:17:12,110
close-up look hundreds of moons and
planets these four giant these planets

684
00:17:12,110 --> 00:17:12,120
planets these four giant these planets
 

685
00:17:12,120 --> 00:17:16,220
planets these four giant these planets
but also it told us the shape of the

686
00:17:16,220 --> 00:17:16,230
but also it told us the shape of the
 

687
00:17:16,230 --> 00:17:18,920
but also it told us the shape of the
solar system as it moves through the

688
00:17:18,920 --> 00:17:18,930
solar system as it moves through the
 

689
00:17:18,930 --> 00:17:20,810
solar system as it moves through the
galaxy because there were two of them

690
00:17:20,810 --> 00:17:20,820
galaxy because there were two of them
 

691
00:17:20,820 --> 00:17:23,370
galaxy because there were two of them
going in different directions

692
00:17:23,370 --> 00:17:23,380
going in different directions
 

693
00:17:23,380 --> 00:17:25,800
going in different directions
and they finally and they arrived in a

694
00:17:25,800 --> 00:17:25,810
and they finally and they arrived in a
 

695
00:17:25,810 --> 00:17:27,870
and they finally and they arrived in a
place called the heliopause which is

696
00:17:27,870 --> 00:17:27,880
place called the heliopause which is
 

697
00:17:27,880 --> 00:17:30,240
place called the heliopause which is
where the wind from the Sun the solar

698
00:17:30,240 --> 00:17:30,250
where the wind from the Sun the solar
 

699
00:17:30,250 --> 00:17:32,970
where the wind from the Sun the solar
wind dies down and the interstellar

700
00:17:32,970 --> 00:17:32,980
wind dies down and the interstellar
 

701
00:17:32,980 --> 00:17:36,810
wind dies down and the interstellar
medium begins and both voyagers were the

702
00:17:36,810 --> 00:17:36,820
medium begins and both voyagers were the
 

703
00:17:36,820 --> 00:17:38,820
medium begins and both voyagers were the
first spacecraft that we had they could

704
00:17:38,820 --> 00:17:38,830
first spacecraft that we had they could
 

705
00:17:38,830 --> 00:17:42,690
first spacecraft that we had they could
tell us when that happened so it's a

706
00:17:42,690 --> 00:17:42,700
tell us when that happened so it's a
 

707
00:17:42,700 --> 00:17:45,860
tell us when that happened so it's a
consummate I think it's the greatest

708
00:17:45,860 --> 00:17:45,870
consummate I think it's the greatest
 

709
00:17:45,870 --> 00:17:49,320
consummate I think it's the greatest
scientific achievement of the 20th

710
00:17:49,320 --> 00:17:49,330
scientific achievement of the 20th
 

711
00:17:49,330 --> 00:17:51,440
scientific achievement of the 20th
century and engineering in some sense

00:17:51,440 --> 00:17:51,450
century and engineering in some sense
 

713
00:17:51,450 --> 00:17:53,820

engineering I mean really you know

714
00:17:53,820 --> 00:17:53,830
engineering I mean really you know

voyagers and Voyager is doing this on

716
00:17:57,350 --> 00:17:57,360
voyagers and Voyager is doing this on
 

717
00:17:57,360 --> 00:18:00,150
voyagers and Voyager is doing this on
less energy than you have in your

718
00:18:00,150 --> 00:18:00,160
less energy than you have in your
 

719
00:18:00,160 --> 00:18:04,740
less energy than you have in your
toaster something like 11 watts so ok

720
00:18:04,740 --> 00:18:04,750
toaster something like 11 watts so ok
 

721
00:18:04,750 --> 00:18:06,770
toaster something like 11 watts so ok
but because of this gravitational assist

722
00:18:06,770 --> 00:18:06,780
but because of this gravitational assist
 

723
00:18:06,780 --> 00:18:11,490
but because of this gravitational assist
both voyagers were destined as I say to

724
00:18:11,490 --> 00:18:11,500
both voyagers were destined as I say to
 

725
00:18:11,500 --> 00:18:12,810
both voyagers were destined as I say to
they were just they were personal they

726
00:18:12,810 --> 00:18:12,820
they were just they were personal they
 

727
00:18:12,820 --> 00:18:14,130
they were just they were personal they
were supposed to function for a dozen

728
00:18:14,130 --> 00:18:14,140
were supposed to function for a dozen
 

729
00:18:14,140 --> 00:18:17,670
were supposed to function for a dozen
years and now it's 42 years since launch

730
00:18:17,670 --> 00:18:17,680
years and now it's 42 years since launch
 

731
00:18:17,680 --> 00:18:20,150
years and now it's 42 years since launch
and we're still talking to them so

732
00:18:20,150 --> 00:18:20,160
and we're still talking to them so
 

733
00:18:20,160 --> 00:18:21,890
and we're still talking to them so
that's amazing

734
00:18:21,890 --> 00:18:21,900
that's amazing
 

735
00:18:21,900 --> 00:18:27,420
that's amazing
but prior to launch almost a year hmm

736
00:18:27,420 --> 00:18:27,430
but prior to launch almost a year hmm
 

737
00:18:27,430 --> 00:18:30,570
but prior to launch almost a year hmm
eight nine months prior to launch it was

00:18:30,580 --> 00:18:33,150
eight nine months prior to launch it was
decided that since Frank Drake and Carl

Sagan and Linda sauceman Sagan had
created something called the Pioneer 10

744
00:18:38,160 --> 00:18:38,170
created something called the Pioneer 10
 

745
00:18:38,170 --> 00:18:41,460
created something called the Pioneer 10
plaque for the Pioneer spacecraft that

a license plate for the planet Earth you

750
00:18:47,430 --> 00:18:47,440
a license plate for the planet Earth you
 

751
00:18:47,440 --> 00:18:50,760
a license plate for the planet Earth you
know a man and a woman hands up you know

752

know a man and a woman hands up you know
 

753
00:18:50,770 --> 00:18:55,550
know a man and a woman hands up you know
very very basic but very effective and

754
00:18:55,550 --> 00:18:55,560
very very basic but very effective and
 

755
00:18:55,560 --> 00:18:58,230
very very basic but very effective and
it captured the imagination of people

756
00:18:58,230 --> 00:18:58,240
it captured the imagination of people
 

757
00:18:58,240 --> 00:19:01,980
it captured the imagination of people
all over the world and so NASA

758
00:19:01,980 --> 00:19:01,990
all over the world and so NASA
 

759
00:19:01,990 --> 00:19:05,700
all over the world and so NASA
turn to Frank and to Carl and said we'd

760
00:19:05,700 --> 00:19:05,710
turn to Frank and to Carl and said we'd
 

761
00:19:05,710 --> 00:19:08,250
turn to Frank and to Carl and said we'd
like you to do a message for Voyager

762
00:19:08,250 --> 00:19:08,260
like you to do a message for Voyager
 

763
00:19:08,260 --> 00:19:12,200
like you to do a message for Voyager
because if it's going to be

764
00:19:12,200 --> 00:19:12,210
because if it's going to be
 

765
00:19:12,210 --> 00:19:14,510
because if it's going to be
circumnavigating the Milky Way galaxy

circumnavigating the Milky Way galaxy
 

767
00:19:14,520 --> 00:19:17,040
circumnavigating the Milky Way galaxy
for one to five billion years you know

768
00:19:17,040 --> 00:19:17,050
for one to five billion years you know
 

769
00:19:17,050 --> 00:19:20,600
for one to five billion years you know
it's like 20 trips around the galaxy and

770
00:19:20,600 --> 00:19:20,610
it's like 20 trips around the galaxy and
 

771
00:19:20,610 --> 00:19:24,360
it's like 20 trips around the galaxy and
there's a very small chance that a

00:19:24,360 --> 00:19:24,370
there's a very small chance that a
 

773
00:19:24,370 --> 00:19:27,000
there's a very small chance that a
spacefaring civilization would be able

spacefaring civilization would be able
 

775
00:19:27,010 --> 00:19:30,540
spacefaring civilization would be able
to flag one of them down and so on board

776
00:19:30,540 --> 00:19:30,550
to flag one of them down and so on board
 

777
00:19:30,550 --> 00:19:33,630
to flag one of them down and so on board
you see this exquisite golden disc with

00:20:04,290 --> 00:20:09,290
record and it contains something like
118 photographs images of life on Earth

794
00:20:09,290 --> 00:20:09,300
118 photographs images of life on Earth

around the world many people describe it
 

799
00:20:20,200 --> 00:20:22,530
around the world many people describe it
as the invention of world music world

00:20:22,530 --> 00:20:22,540
as the invention of world music world
 

801
00:20:22,540 --> 00:20:25,140
as the invention of world music world
music was not a concept that existed

802
00:20:25,140 --> 00:20:25,150
music was not a concept that existed
 

803
00:20:25,150 --> 00:20:27,540
music was not a concept that existed
before the Voyager record and we were

804
00:20:27,540 --> 00:20:27,550
before the Voyager record and we were
 

805
00:20:27,550 --> 00:20:30,090
before the Voyager record and we were
determined to take our music not just

806
00:20:30,090 --> 00:20:30,100
determined to take our music not just
 

807
00:20:30,100 --> 00:20:33,030
determined to take our music not just
from the dominant technical cultures but

808
00:20:33,030 --> 00:20:33,040
from the dominant technical cultures but
 

809
00:20:33,040 --> 00:20:37,260
from the dominant technical cultures but
from all of the rich cultural heritage

from all of the rich cultural heritage
 

811
00:20:37,270 --> 00:20:40,500
from all of the rich cultural heritage
of the earth and there's a sound essay

812
00:20:40,500 --> 00:20:40,510
of the earth and there's a sound essay
 

813
00:20:40,510 --> 00:20:44,700
of the earth and there's a sound essay
which is kind of using using a

814
00:20:44,700 --> 00:20:44,710
which is kind of using using a
 

815
00:20:44,710 --> 00:20:48,420
which is kind of using using a
microphone as a camera to tell the story

816
00:20:48,420 --> 00:20:48,430
microphone as a camera to tell the story
 

817
00:20:48,430 --> 00:20:51,830
microphone as a camera to tell the story
of the earth beginning with its

geological sounds and moving into

geological sounds and moving into
 

821
00:20:55,920 --> 00:21:00,230
geological sounds and moving into
biology and then into technology and

biology and then into technology and

00:21:02,340 --> 00:21:02,350
likes I think what you were getting at
 

825
00:21:02,350 --> 00:21:07,220
likes I think what you were getting at
is that at the end of this sound essay I

826
00:21:07,220 --> 00:21:07,230
is that at the end of this sound essay I
 

827
00:21:07,230 --> 00:21:12,120
is that at the end of this sound essay I
had asked Carl if it were in the making

828
00:21:12,120 --> 00:21:12,130
had asked Carl if it were in the making
 

829
00:21:12,130 --> 00:21:14,040
had asked Carl if it were in the making
of the record it was my honor to be the

830
00:21:14,040 --> 00:21:14,050
of the record it was my honor to be the
 

831
00:21:14,050 --> 00:21:15,480
of the record it was my honor to be the
creative director of the

832
00:21:15,480 --> 00:21:15,490
creative director of the
 

833
00:21:15,490 --> 00:21:19,260
creative director of the
project if it was possible to if I had

834
00:21:19,260 --> 00:21:19,270
project if it was possible to if I had
 

835
00:21:19,270 --> 00:21:23,100
project if it was possible to if I had
meditated for an hour while I was hooked

836
00:21:23,100 --> 00:21:23,110
meditated for an hour while I was hooked
 

837
00:21:23,110 --> 00:21:27,240
meditated for an hour while I was hooked
up so that you know every single signal

838
00:21:27,240 --> 00:21:27,250
up so that you know every single signal
 

839
00:21:27,250 --> 00:21:31,530
up so that you know every single signal
it was coming from my brain my body was

840
00:21:31,530 --> 00:21:31,540
it was coming from my brain my body was
 

841
00:21:31,540 --> 00:21:37,140
it was coming from my brain my body was
recorded and then converted into into

842
00:21:37,140 --> 00:21:37,150
recorded and then converted into into
 

843
00:21:37,150 --> 00:21:39,750
recorded and then converted into into
sound for the record was it possible

844
00:21:39,750 --> 00:21:39,760
sound for the record was it possible
 

845
00:21:39,760 --> 00:21:42,419
sound for the record was it possible
that these putative extraterrestrials of

846
00:21:42,419 --> 00:21:42,429
that these putative extraterrestrials of
 

847
00:21:42,429 --> 00:21:44,640
that these putative extraterrestrials of
the distant future of perhaps the

848
00:21:44,640 --> 00:21:44,650
the distant future of perhaps the
 

849
00:21:44,650 --> 00:21:47,520
the distant future of perhaps the
billion years from now would be able to

850
00:21:47,520 --> 00:21:47,530
billion years from now would be able to
 

851
00:21:47,530 --> 00:21:49,860
billion years from now would be able to
reconstitute this message and to

852
00:21:49,860 --> 00:21:49,870
reconstitute this message and to
 

853
00:21:49,870 --> 00:21:58,380
reconstitute this message and to
understand it and he just big smile and

854
00:21:58,380 --> 00:21:58,390
understand it and he just big smile and
 

855
00:21:58,390 --> 00:22:01,980
understand it and he just big smile and
so I did this and what were you thinking

856
00:22:01,980 --> 00:22:01,990
so I did this and what were you thinking
 

857
00:22:01,990 --> 00:22:04,350
so I did this and what were you thinking
about in the meditation like what I mean

858
00:22:04,350 --> 00:22:04,360
about in the meditation like what I mean
 

859
00:22:04,360 --> 00:22:06,049
about in the meditation like what I mean
it's such an interesting idea of

860
00:22:06,049 --> 00:22:06,059
it's such an interesting idea of
 

861
00:22:06,059 --> 00:22:09,150
it's such an interesting idea of
recording as you think about things what

862
00:22:09,150 --> 00:22:09,160
recording as you think about things what
 

863
00:22:09,160 --> 00:22:11,390
recording as you think about things what
were you thinking about so I was

864
00:22:11,390 --> 00:22:11,400
were you thinking about so I was
 

865
00:22:11,400 --> 00:22:16,169
were you thinking about so I was
blindfolded and couldn't hear anything

866
00:22:16,169 --> 00:22:16,179
blindfolded and couldn't hear anything
 

867
00:22:16,179 --> 00:22:21,030
blindfolded and couldn't hear anything
and I had made an a mental itinerary of

868
00:22:21,030 --> 00:22:21,040
and I had made an a mental itinerary of
 

869
00:22:21,040 --> 00:22:25,580
and I had made an a mental itinerary of
exactly where I wanted to go I was truly

870
00:22:25,580 --> 00:22:25,590
exactly where I wanted to go I was truly
 

871
00:22:25,590 --> 00:22:31,169
exactly where I wanted to go I was truly
humbled by the idea that these thoughts

872
00:22:31,169 --> 00:22:31,179
humbled by the idea that these thoughts
 

873
00:22:31,179 --> 00:22:33,900
humbled by the idea that these thoughts
could conceivably touch the distant

874
00:22:33,900 --> 00:22:33,910
could conceivably touch the distant
 

875
00:22:33,910 --> 00:22:34,320
could conceivably touch the distant
future

876
00:22:34,320 --> 00:22:34,330
future
 

877
00:22:34,330 --> 00:22:37,860
future
that's incredible so it's 1977 there are

878
00:22:37,860 --> 00:22:37,870
that's incredible so it's 1977 there are
 

879
00:22:37,870 --> 00:22:40,950
that's incredible so it's 1977 there are
some 60,000 nuclear weapons on the

880
00:22:40,950 --> 00:22:40,960
some 60,000 nuclear weapons on the
 

881
00:22:40,960 --> 00:22:43,620
some 60,000 nuclear weapons on the
planet the Soviet Union and the United

882
00:22:43,620 --> 00:22:43,630
planet the Soviet Union and the United
 

883
00:22:43,630 --> 00:22:46,320
planet the Soviet Union and the United
States are engaged in a you know to the

884
00:22:46,320 --> 00:22:46,330
States are engaged in a you know to the
 

885
00:22:46,330 --> 00:22:52,830
States are engaged in a you know to the
death competition and so I began by

886
00:22:52,830 --> 00:22:52,840
death competition and so I began by
 

887
00:22:52,840 --> 00:22:55,440
death competition and so I began by
trying to tell the history of the planet

888
00:22:55,440 --> 00:22:55,450
trying to tell the history of the planet
 

889
00:22:55,450 --> 00:23:00,330
trying to tell the history of the planet
in you know to my limited ability what I

890
00:23:00,330 --> 00:23:00,340
in you know to my limited ability what I
 

891
00:23:00,340 --> 00:23:04,010
in you know to my limited ability what I
understood about the story of the early

892
00:23:04,010 --> 00:23:04,020
understood about the story of the early
 

893
00:23:04,020 --> 00:23:06,690
understood about the story of the early
existence of the war of the planet about

894
00:23:06,690 --> 00:23:06,700
existence of the war of the planet about
 

895
00:23:06,700 --> 00:23:09,720
existence of the war of the planet about
the origin of life about the evolution

896
00:23:09,720 --> 00:23:09,730
the origin of life about the evolution
 

897
00:23:09,730 --> 00:23:14,510
the origin of life about the evolution
of life about our the history of humans

898
00:23:14,510 --> 00:23:14,520
of life about our the history of humans
 

899
00:23:14,520 --> 00:23:18,000
of life about our the history of humans
about our current at that time

900
00:23:18,000 --> 00:23:18,010
about our current at that time
 

901
00:23:18,010 --> 00:23:21,090
about our current at that time
predicament about the fact that one in

902
00:23:21,090 --> 00:23:21,100
predicament about the fact that one in
 

903
00:23:21,100 --> 00:23:26,040
predicament about the fact that one in
five of us was starving uh or unable to

904
00:23:26,040 --> 00:23:26,050
five of us was starving uh or unable to
 

905
00:23:26,050 --> 00:23:28,290
five of us was starving uh or unable to
get potable water

906
00:23:28,290 --> 00:23:28,300
get potable water
 

907
00:23:28,300 --> 00:23:33,500
get potable water
and so I sort of gave a kind of you know

908
00:23:33,500 --> 00:23:33,510
and so I sort of gave a kind of you know
 

909
00:23:33,510 --> 00:23:36,390
and so I sort of gave a kind of you know
it's general a picture as I possibly

910
00:23:36,390 --> 00:23:36,400
it's general a picture as I possibly
 

911
00:23:36,400 --> 00:23:38,270
it's general a picture as I possibly
could of our predicament

912
00:23:38,270 --> 00:23:38,280
could of our predicament
 

913
00:23:38,280 --> 00:23:46,350
could of our predicament
and I also I was Perry newly within days

914
00:23:46,350 --> 00:23:46,360
and I also I was Perry newly within days
 

915
00:23:46,360 --> 00:23:50,490
and I also I was Perry newly within days
of the moment when Carl and I fell in

916
00:23:50,490 --> 00:23:50,500
of the moment when Carl and I fell in
 

917
00:23:50,500 --> 00:23:51,990
of the moment when Carl and I fell in
love with each other maybe we fell in

918
00:23:51,990 --> 00:23:52,000
love with each other maybe we fell in
 

919
00:23:52,000 --> 00:23:53,520
love with each other maybe we fell in
love with each other long before because

920
00:23:53,520 --> 00:23:53,530
love with each other long before because
 

921
00:23:53,530 --> 00:23:55,710
love with each other long before because
we'd known each other for years but it

922
00:23:55,710 --> 00:23:55,720
we'd known each other for years but it
 

923
00:23:55,720 --> 00:23:58,410
we'd known each other for years but it
was the first time we had expressed our

924
00:23:58,410 --> 00:23:58,420
was the first time we had expressed our
 

925
00:23:58,420 --> 00:24:00,360
was the first time we had expressed our
feelings for each other acknowledged did

926
00:24:00,360 --> 00:24:00,370
feelings for each other acknowledged did
 

927
00:24:00,370 --> 00:24:02,280
feelings for each other acknowledged did
the existence of this yes because we're

928
00:24:02,280 --> 00:24:02,290
the existence of this yes because we're
 

929
00:24:02,290 --> 00:24:04,800
the existence of this yes because we're
both involved with other people and it

930
00:24:04,800 --> 00:24:04,810
both involved with other people and it
 

931
00:24:04,810 --> 00:24:10,230
both involved with other people and it
was a completely outside his morality in

00:24:10,230 --> 00:24:10,240
was a completely outside his morality in
 

933
00:24:10,240 --> 00:24:14,310
was a completely outside his morality in
mine to even broach the subject but it

934
00:24:14,310 --> 00:24:14,320
mine to even broach the subject but it
 

935
00:24:14,320 --> 00:24:17,340
mine to even broach the subject but it
was only days after that it happened and

936
00:24:17,340 --> 00:24:17,350
was only days after that it happened and
 

937
00:24:17,350 --> 00:24:21,180
was only days after that it happened and
for me it was a Eureka moment it was in

938
00:24:21,180 --> 00:24:21,190
for me it was a Eureka moment it was in
 

939
00:24:21,190 --> 00:24:24,240
for me it was a Eureka moment it was in
the context of finding that piece of

the context of finding that piece of
 

941
00:24:24,250 --> 00:24:27,960
the context of finding that piece of
Chinese music that was worthy to

942
00:24:27,960 --> 00:24:27,970
Chinese music that was worthy to
 

943
00:24:27,970 --> 00:24:30,390
Chinese music that was worthy to
represent one of the oldest musical

944

represent one of the oldest musical

represent one of the oldest musical
traditions on earth when those of us who

1089
00:28:24,790 --> 00:28:29,250
next image was kind of overlay schematic
to show the fetus inside this woman that

so in some sense that congressman also
represents our society perhaps his

if you think about it did our darker

1124
00:29:24,450 --> 00:29:24,460
if you think about it did our darker
 

1125
00:29:24,460 --> 00:29:26,940
if you think about it did our darker
moments are they essential for Humanity

00:29:26,940 --> 00:29:26,950
moments are they essential for Humanity
 

1127
00:29:26,950 --> 00:29:28,590

all the wars we've been through all the

1128
00:29:28,590 --> 00:29:28,600
all the wars we've been through all the
 

1129
00:29:28,600 --> 00:29:30,630
all the wars we've been through all the
tortures and the suffering and the

1130
00:29:30,630 --> 00:29:30,640
tortures and the suffering and the
 

1131
00:29:30,640 --> 00:29:34,260
tortures and the suffering and the
cruelty is that essential for happiness

1132
00:29:34,260 --> 00:29:34,270
cruelty is that essential for happiness
 

1133
00:29:34,270 --> 00:29:37,530
cruelty is that essential for happiness
for beauty for creation generally he's

1134
00:29:37,530 --> 00:29:37,540
for beauty for creation generally he's
 

1135
00:29:37,540 --> 00:29:39,300
for beauty for creation generally he's
really not essential for a happiness or

1136
00:29:39,300 --> 00:29:39,310
really not essential for a happiness or
 

1137
00:29:39,310 --> 00:29:41,550
really not essential for a happiness or
beauty as for sure I mean it's part of

1138
00:29:41,550 --> 00:29:41,560
beauty as for sure I mean it's part of
 

1139
00:29:41,560 --> 00:29:43,530
beauty as for sure I mean it's part of
who we are if we're gonna be real about

1140
00:29:43,530 --> 00:29:43,540
who we are if we're gonna be real about
 

1141
00:29:43,540 --> 00:29:43,800
who we are if we're gonna be real about
it

1142
00:29:43,800 --> 00:29:43,810
it
 

1143
00:29:43,810 --> 00:29:47,010
it
which is you know I I think we tell on

1144
00:29:47,010 --> 00:29:47,020
which is you know I I think we tell on
 

1145
00:29:47,020 --> 00:29:49,050
which is you know I I think we tell on
ourselves even if we don't want to be

1146
00:29:49,050 --> 00:29:49,060
ourselves even if we don't want to be
 

1147
00:29:49,060 --> 00:29:52,050
ourselves even if we don't want to be
real we you know I think that if you're

1148
00:29:52,050 --> 00:29:52,060
real we you know I think that if you're
 

1149
00:29:52,060 --> 00:29:55,010
real we you know I think that if you're
a spacefaring civilization and you've

1150
00:29:55,010 --> 00:29:55,020
a spacefaring civilization and you've
 

1151
00:29:55,020 --> 00:29:58,500
a spacefaring civilization and you've
gotten it together sufficiently you can

1152
00:29:58,500 --> 00:29:58,510
gotten it together sufficiently you can
 

1153
00:29:58,510 --> 00:30:02,370
gotten it together sufficiently you can
move from world to world then I think

1154
00:30:02,370 --> 00:30:02,380
move from world to world then I think
 

1155
00:30:02,380 --> 00:30:04,590
move from world to world then I think
they probably took one look at this

1156
00:30:04,590 --> 00:30:04,600
they probably took one look at this
 

1157
00:30:04,600 --> 00:30:07,800
they probably took one look at this
derelict spacecraft and they knew that

1158
00:30:07,800 --> 00:30:07,810
derelict spacecraft and they knew that
 

1159
00:30:07,810 --> 00:30:09,210
derelict spacecraft and they knew that
these were people in their techno

1160
00:30:09,210 --> 00:30:09,220
these were people in their techno
 

1161
00:30:09,220 --> 00:30:11,880
these were people in their techno
logical adolescence yeah and they were

1162
00:30:11,880 --> 00:30:11,890
logical adolescence yeah and they were
 

1163
00:30:11,890 --> 00:30:14,850
logical adolescence yeah and they were
just setting forth and they must have

1164
00:30:14,850 --> 00:30:14,860
just setting forth and they must have
 

1165
00:30:14,860 --> 00:30:17,539
just setting forth and they must have
had these issues but you know because

1166
00:30:17,539 --> 00:30:17,549
had these issues but you know because
 

1167
00:30:17,549 --> 00:30:21,149
had these issues but you know because
and so really you know that's the great

1168
00:30:21,149 --> 00:30:21,159
and so really you know that's the great
 

1169
00:30:21,159 --> 00:30:24,149
and so really you know that's the great
thing about lying is that a lie only has

1170
00:30:24,149 --> 00:30:24,159
thing about lying is that a lie only has
 

1171
00:30:24,159 --> 00:30:26,730
thing about lying is that a lie only has
a shelf life like if you make a great

1172
00:30:26,730 --> 00:30:26,740
a shelf life like if you make a great
 

1173
00:30:26,740 --> 00:30:31,110
a shelf life like if you make a great
work of art that's a forgery people can

1174
00:30:31,110 --> 00:30:31,120
work of art that's a forgery people can
 

1175
00:30:31,120 --> 00:30:33,539
work of art that's a forgery people can
be fooled immediately but 10 or 15 years

1176
00:30:33,539 --> 00:30:33,549
be fooled immediately but 10 or 15 years
 

1177
00:30:33,549 --> 00:30:35,549
be fooled immediately but 10 or 15 years
20 years later they start to look at it

1178
00:30:35,549 --> 00:30:35,559
20 years later they start to look at it
 

1179
00:30:35,559 --> 00:30:38,159
20 years later they start to look at it
yeah you know that begin to realize of

1180
00:30:38,159 --> 00:30:38,169
yeah you know that begin to realize of
 

1181
00:30:38,169 --> 00:30:42,560
yeah you know that begin to realize of
the lens our lens of our present is

1182
00:30:42,560 --> 00:30:42,570
the lens our lens of our present is
 

1183
00:30:42,570 --> 00:30:47,220
the lens our lens of our present is
coloring everything that we see so you

1184
00:30:47,220 --> 00:30:47,230
coloring everything that we see so you
 

1185
00:30:47,230 --> 00:30:49,080
coloring everything that we see so you
know I think it didn't matter that we

1186
00:30:49,080 --> 00:30:49,090
know I think it didn't matter that we
 

1187
00:30:49,090 --> 00:30:52,710
know I think it didn't matter that we
didn't show our atrocities they would

1188
00:30:52,710 --> 00:30:52,720
didn't show our atrocities they would
 

1189
00:30:52,720 --> 00:30:54,720
didn't show our atrocities they would
fill in the blanks they would fill in

1190
00:30:54,720 --> 00:30:54,730
fill in the blanks they would fill in
 

1191
00:30:54,730 --> 00:30:57,090
fill in the blanks they would fill in
the blanks so let me sort of ask you've

1192
00:30:57,090 --> 00:30:57,100
the blanks so let me sort of ask you've
 

1193
00:30:57,100 --> 00:31:00,450
the blanks so let me sort of ask you've
mentioned how likely it is that you and

1194
00:31:00,450 --> 00:31:00,460
mentioned how likely it is that you and
 

1195
00:31:00,460 --> 00:31:03,120
mentioned how likely it is that you and
Carla did two souls like yours would

1196
00:31:03,120 --> 00:31:03,130
Carla did two souls like yours would
 

1197
00:31:03,130 --> 00:31:05,390
Carla did two souls like yours would
meet in this vast world

1198
00:31:05,390 --> 00:31:05,400
meet in this vast world
 

1199
00:31:05,400 --> 00:31:08,039
meet in this vast world
what are you views on how and why

1200
00:31:08,039 --> 00:31:08,049
what are you views on how and why
 

1201
00:31:08,049 --> 00:31:10,289
what are you views on how and why
incredibly unlikely things like these

1202
00:31:10,289 --> 00:31:10,299
incredibly unlikely things like these
 

1203
00:31:10,299 --> 00:31:13,620
incredibly unlikely things like these
nevertheless do happen it's purely to me

1204
00:31:13,620 --> 00:31:13,630
nevertheless do happen it's purely to me
 

1205
00:31:13,630 --> 00:31:16,919
nevertheless do happen it's purely to me
a chance it's totally random

1206
00:31:16,919 --> 00:31:16,929
a chance it's totally random
 

1207
00:31:16,929 --> 00:31:20,669
a chance it's totally random
it's adjust I mean but and the fact is

1208
00:31:20,669 --> 00:31:20,679
it's adjust I mean but and the fact is
 

1209
00:31:20,679 --> 00:31:23,490
it's adjust I mean but and the fact is
is there some people or and it's

1210
00:31:23,490 --> 00:31:23,500
is there some people or and it's
 

1211
00:31:23,500 --> 00:31:26,159
is there some people or and it's
happening every day right now some

1212
00:31:26,159 --> 00:31:26,169
happening every day right now some
 

1213
00:31:26,169 --> 00:31:29,549
happening every day right now some
people are the random casualties of

1214
00:31:29,549 --> 00:31:29,559
people are the random casualties of
 

1215
00:31:29,559 --> 00:31:32,399
people are the random casualties of
chance and that and I don't just mean

1216
00:31:32,399 --> 00:31:32,409
chance and that and I don't just mean
 

1217
00:31:32,409 --> 00:31:35,180
chance and that and I don't just mean
the people who are being you know

1218
00:31:35,180 --> 00:31:35,190
the people who are being you know
 

1219
00:31:35,190 --> 00:31:39,779
the people who are being you know
destroyed in childhood in more time I'm

1220
00:31:39,779 --> 00:31:39,789
destroyed in childhood in more time I'm
 

1221
00:31:39,789 --> 00:31:41,399
destroyed in childhood in more time I'm
also or people who starve to death

1222
00:31:41,399 --> 00:31:41,409
also or people who starve to death
 

1223
00:31:41,409 --> 00:31:44,789
also or people who starve to death
because of famine but also the people

1224
00:31:44,789 --> 00:31:44,799
because of famine but also the people
 

1225
00:31:44,799 --> 00:31:50,850
because of famine but also the people
who um you know who who are not living

1226
00:31:50,850 --> 00:31:50,860
who um you know who who are not living
 

1227
00:31:50,860 --> 00:31:52,950
who um you know who who are not living
to the fullest all of these things I

1228
00:31:52,950 --> 00:31:52,960
to the fullest all of these things I
 

1229
00:31:52,960 --> 00:31:54,779
to the fullest all of these things I
think there's a rent my parents met on

1230
00:31:54,779 --> 00:31:54,789
think there's a rent my parents met on
 

1231
00:31:54,789 --> 00:31:58,020
think there's a rent my parents met on
the subway in rush hour and so I'm only

1232
00:31:58,020 --> 00:31:58,030
the subway in rush hour and so I'm only
 

1233
00:31:58,030 --> 00:32:00,830
the subway in rush hour and so I'm only
here were you because of the most random

1234
00:32:00,830 --> 00:32:00,840
here were you because of the most random
 

1235
00:32:00,840 --> 00:32:04,320
here were you because of the most random
possible situation and so I've had this

1236
00:32:04,320 --> 00:32:04,330
possible situation and so I've had this
 

1237
00:32:04,330 --> 00:32:06,570
possible situation and so I've had this
a sense of this even before I knew car I

1238
00:32:06,570 --> 00:32:06,580
a sense of this even before I knew car I
 

1239
00:32:06,580 --> 00:32:09,750
a sense of this even before I knew car I
always felt this way that I only existed

1240
00:32:09,750 --> 00:32:09,760
always felt this way that I only existed
 

1241
00:32:09,760 --> 00:32:12,510
always felt this way that I only existed
because of the generosity of the rush

1242
00:32:12,510 --> 00:32:12,520
because of the generosity of the rush
 

1243
00:32:12,520 --> 00:32:17,399
because of the generosity of the rush
hour I know just all of the things all

1244
00:32:17,399 --> 00:32:17,409
hour I know just all of the things all
 

1245
00:32:17,409 --> 00:32:20,390
hour I know just all of the things all
of the skeins of causality

1246
00:32:20,390 --> 00:32:20,400
of the skeins of causality
 

1247
00:32:20,400 --> 00:32:22,580
of the skeins of causality
yeah it's interesting because you know

1248
00:32:22,580 --> 00:32:22,590
yeah it's interesting because you know
 

1249
00:32:22,590 --> 00:32:24,710
yeah it's interesting because you know
that our shower is the source of stress

1250
00:32:24,710 --> 00:32:24,720
that our shower is the source of stress
 

1251
00:32:24,720 --> 00:32:27,880
that our shower is the source of stress
for a lot of people but clearly in its

1252
00:32:27,880 --> 00:32:27,890
for a lot of people but clearly in its
 

1253
00:32:27,890 --> 00:32:30,590
for a lot of people but clearly in its
moments it can also be a source of

1254
00:32:30,590 --> 00:32:30,600
moments it can also be a source of
 

1255
00:32:30,600 --> 00:32:32,960
moments it can also be a source of
something beautiful it's right of

1256
00:32:32,960 --> 00:32:32,970
something beautiful it's right of
 

1257
00:32:32,970 --> 00:32:35,360
something beautiful it's right of
strangers meeting and so on so

1258
00:32:35,360 --> 00:32:35,370
strangers meeting and so on so
 

1259
00:32:35,370 --> 00:32:38,360
strangers meeting and so on so
everything everything is has the

1260
00:32:38,360 --> 00:32:38,370
everything everything is has the
 

1261
00:32:38,370 --> 00:32:43,010
everything everything is has the
possibility of doing some fancy right so

1262
00:32:43,010 --> 00:32:43,020
possibility of doing some fancy right so
 

1263
00:32:43,020 --> 00:32:45,530
possibility of doing some fancy right so
let me ask sort of a quick tangent on

1264
00:32:45,530 --> 00:32:45,540
let me ask sort of a quick tangent on
 

1265
00:32:45,540 --> 00:32:49,040
let me ask sort of a quick tangent on
the Voyager so that this this beautiful

1266
00:32:49,040 --> 00:32:49,050
the Voyager so that this this beautiful
 

1267
00:32:49,050 --> 00:32:52,730
the Voyager so that this this beautiful
romantic notion that Voyager 1 is sort

1268
00:32:52,730 --> 00:32:52,740
romantic notion that Voyager 1 is sort
 

1269
00:32:52,740 --> 00:32:55,220
romantic notion that Voyager 1 is sort
of our farthest human reach into space

1270
00:32:55,220 --> 00:32:55,230
of our farthest human reach into space
 

1271
00:32:55,230 --> 00:32:57,800
of our farthest human reach into space
if you think of what I don't know if

1272
00:32:57,800 --> 00:32:57,810
if you think of what I don't know if
 

1273
00:32:57,810 --> 00:33:00,410
if you think of what I don't know if
you've seen but what Elon Musk did with

1274
00:33:00,410 --> 00:33:00,420
you've seen but what Elon Musk did with
 

1275
00:33:00,420 --> 00:33:03,650
you've seen but what Elon Musk did with
the putting the roadster letting it fly

1276
00:33:03,650 --> 00:33:03,660
the putting the roadster letting it fly
 

1277
00:33:03,660 --> 00:33:06,320
the putting the roadster letting it fly
out into space there's a sort of humor

1278
00:33:06,320 --> 00:33:06,330
out into space there's a sort of humor
 

1279
00:33:06,330 --> 00:33:08,810
out into space there's a sort of humor
to it I think that's also kind of

1280
00:33:08,810 --> 00:33:08,820
to it I think that's also kind of
 

1281
00:33:08,820 --> 00:33:11,600
to it I think that's also kind of
interesting but maybe you can comment on

1282
00:33:11,600 --> 00:33:11,610
interesting but maybe you can comment on
 

1283
00:33:11,610 --> 00:33:16,630
interesting but maybe you can comment on
that but in general if now that we are

1284
00:33:16,630 --> 00:33:16,640
that but in general if now that we are
 

1285
00:33:16,640 --> 00:33:18,950
that but in general if now that we are
developing what we were venturing out

1286
00:33:18,950 --> 00:33:18,960
developing what we were venturing out
 

1287
00:33:18,960 --> 00:33:21,050
developing what we were venturing out
into space again in a more serious way

1288
00:33:21,050 --> 00:33:21,060
into space again in a more serious way
 

1289
00:33:21,060 --> 00:33:24,440
into space again in a more serious way
what kind of stuff that represent since

1290
00:33:24,440 --> 00:33:24,450
what kind of stuff that represent since
 

1291
00:33:24,450 --> 00:33:27,350
what kind of stuff that represent since
Voyager was launched should we send out

1292
00:33:27,350 --> 00:33:27,360
Voyager was launched should we send out
 

1293
00:33:27,360 --> 00:33:30,770
Voyager was launched should we send out
as a follow-up is there things that you

1294
00:33:30,770 --> 00:33:30,780
as a follow-up is there things that you
 

1295
00:33:30,780 --> 00:33:32,990
as a follow-up is there things that you
think that's developed the next in in

1296
00:33:32,990 --> 00:33:33,000
think that's developed the next in in
 

1297
00:33:33,000 --> 00:33:35,600
think that's developed the next in in
the 40 years after that we should update

1298
00:33:35,600 --> 00:33:35,610
the 40 years after that we should update
 

1299
00:33:35,610 --> 00:33:39,440
the 40 years after that we should update
the the spacefaring aliens of course now

1300
00:33:39,440 --> 00:33:39,450
the the spacefaring aliens of course now
 

1301
00:33:39,450 --> 00:33:42,020
the the spacefaring aliens of course now
we could send the worldwide we could

1302
00:33:42,020 --> 00:33:42,030
we could send the worldwide we could
 

1303
00:33:42,030 --> 00:33:44,420
we could send the worldwide we could
send everything that's on the world wide

1304
00:33:44,420 --> 00:33:44,430
send everything that's on the world wide
 

1305
00:33:44,430 --> 00:33:47,870
send everything that's on the world wide
web we could send I mean you know that

1306
00:33:47,870 --> 00:33:47,880
web we could send I mean you know that
 

1307
00:33:47,880 --> 00:33:49,610
web we could send I mean you know that
was a time when we're talking about

1308
00:33:49,610 --> 00:33:49,620
was a time when we're talking about
 

1309
00:33:49,620 --> 00:33:52,220
was a time when we're talking about
phonograph records and transistor radios

1310
00:33:52,220 --> 00:33:52,230
phonograph records and transistor radios
 

1311
00:33:52,230 --> 00:33:57,920
phonograph records and transistor radios
and you know so we tried to be to take

1312
00:33:57,920 --> 00:33:57,930
and you know so we tried to be to take
 

1313
00:33:57,930 --> 00:34:00,260
and you know so we tried to be to take
advantage of the existing technology to

1314
00:34:00,260 --> 00:34:00,270
advantage of the existing technology to
 

1315
00:34:00,270 --> 00:34:02,930
advantage of the existing technology to
the fullest extent you know the computer

1316
00:34:02,930 --> 00:34:02,940
the fullest extent you know the computer
 

1317
00:34:02,940 --> 00:34:05,120
the fullest extent you know the computer
that was hooked up to me from my brain

1318
00:34:05,120 --> 00:34:05,130
that was hooked up to me from my brain
 

1319
00:34:05,130 --> 00:34:06,830
that was hooked up to me from my brain
waves in my heart sounds while I was

1320
00:34:06,830 --> 00:34:06,840
waves in my heart sounds while I was
 

1321
00:34:06,840 --> 00:34:10,250
waves in my heart sounds while I was
meditating was the size of a gigantic

1322
00:34:10,250 --> 00:34:10,260
meditating was the size of a gigantic
 

1323
00:34:10,260 --> 00:34:13,399
meditating was the size of a gigantic
room and I'm sure it's not that didn't

1324
00:34:13,399 --> 00:34:13,409
room and I'm sure it's not that didn't
 

1325
00:34:13,409 --> 00:34:16,430
room and I'm sure it's not that didn't
have the power of a phone as that phone

1326
00:34:16,430 --> 00:34:16,440
have the power of a phone as that phone
 

1327
00:34:16,440 --> 00:34:19,669
have the power of a phone as that phone
has now so you know we could just I

1328
00:34:19,669 --> 00:34:19,679
has now so you know we could just I
 

1329
00:34:19,679 --> 00:34:21,230
has now so you know we could just I
think we could let it all hang out you

1330
00:34:21,230 --> 00:34:21,240
think we could let it all hang out you
 

1331
00:34:21,240 --> 00:34:23,570
think we could let it all hang out you
just stood send you know ever we I mean

1332
00:34:23,570 --> 00:34:23,580
just stood send you know ever we I mean
 

1333
00:34:23,580 --> 00:34:26,810
just stood send you know ever we I mean
that's the wonder like I would send you

1334
00:34:26,810 --> 00:34:26,820
that's the wonder like I would send you
 

1335
00:34:26,820 --> 00:34:30,770
that's the wonder like I would send you
know Wikipedia or something and not

1336
00:34:30,770 --> 00:34:30,780
know Wikipedia or something and not
 

1337
00:34:30,780 --> 00:34:33,359
know Wikipedia or something and not
being a gatekeeper but

1338
00:34:33,359 --> 00:34:33,369
being a gatekeeper but
 

1339
00:34:33,369 --> 00:34:35,809
being a gatekeeper but
this thing because we are you were also

1340
00:34:35,809 --> 00:34:35,819
this thing because we are you were also
 

1341
00:34:35,819 --> 00:34:38,249
this thing because we are you were also
it's interesting because it one of the

1342
00:34:38,249 --> 00:34:38,259
it's interesting because it one of the
 

1343
00:34:38,259 --> 00:34:40,409
it's interesting because it one of the
problems of the Internet of having so

1344
00:34:40,409 --> 00:34:40,419
problems of the Internet of having so
 

1345
00:34:40,419 --> 00:34:43,460
problems of the Internet of having so
much information is it's actually the

1346
00:34:43,460 --> 00:34:43,470
much information is it's actually the
 

1347
00:34:43,470 --> 00:34:46,950
much information is it's actually the
curation the human curation is still the

1348
00:34:46,950 --> 00:34:46,960
curation the human curation is still the
 

1349
00:34:46,960 --> 00:34:49,139
curation the human curation is still the
powerful beautiful thing yeah so what

1350
00:34:49,139 --> 00:34:49,149
powerful beautiful thing yeah so what
 

1351
00:34:49,149 --> 00:34:51,960
powerful beautiful thing yeah so what
you did with the record is actually is

1352
00:34:51,960 --> 00:34:51,970
you did with the record is actually is
 

1353
00:34:51,970 --> 00:34:54,749
you did with the record is actually is
exactly the right process is kind of

1354
00:34:54,749 --> 00:34:54,759
exactly the right process is kind of
 

1355
00:34:54,759 --> 00:34:56,789
exactly the right process is kind of
boiling down a massive amount of

1356
00:34:56,789 --> 00:34:56,799
boiling down a massive amount of
 

1357
00:34:56,799 --> 00:34:58,170
boiling down a massive amount of
possibilities of what you could send

1358
00:34:58,170 --> 00:34:58,180
possibilities of what you could send
 

1359
00:34:58,180 --> 00:35:01,259
possibilities of what you could send
into something that represents you know

1360
00:35:01,259 --> 00:35:01,269
into something that represents you know
 

1361
00:35:01,269 --> 00:35:03,059
into something that represents you know
the better angels of our nature or

1362
00:35:03,059 --> 00:35:03,069
the better angels of our nature or
 

1363
00:35:03,069 --> 00:35:06,329
the better angels of our nature or
represents our humanity so if you think

1364
00:35:06,329 --> 00:35:06,339
represents our humanity so if you think
 

1365
00:35:06,339 --> 00:35:10,499
represents our humanity so if you think
about you know what would you send from

1366
00:35:10,499 --> 00:35:10,509
about you know what would you send from
 

1367
00:35:10,509 --> 00:35:11,730
about you know what would you send from
the Internet as opposed to sending all

1368
00:35:11,730 --> 00:35:11,740
the Internet as opposed to sending all
 

1369
00:35:11,740 --> 00:35:13,470
the Internet as opposed to sending all
of Wikipedia for example all human

1370
00:35:13,470 --> 00:35:13,480
of Wikipedia for example all human
 

1371
00:35:13,480 --> 00:35:16,680
of Wikipedia for example all human
knowledge is there something just new

1372
00:35:16,680 --> 00:35:16,690
knowledge is there something just new
 

1373
00:35:16,690 --> 00:35:18,690
knowledge is there something just new
that we've developed you think or

1374
00:35:18,690 --> 00:35:18,700
that we've developed you think or
 

1375
00:35:18,700 --> 00:35:21,690
that we've developed you think or
fundamentally we're still the same kind

1376
00:35:21,690 --> 00:35:21,700
fundamentally we're still the same kind
 

1377
00:35:21,700 --> 00:35:24,930
fundamentally we're still the same kind
of human species I think fundamentally

1378
00:35:24,930 --> 00:35:24,940
of human species I think fundamentally
 

1379
00:35:24,940 --> 00:35:27,599
of human species I think fundamentally
were the same but we have a kind of way

1380
00:35:27,599 --> 00:35:27,609
were the same but we have a kind of way
 

1381
00:35:27,609 --> 00:35:31,349
were the same but we have a kind of way
we are we have advanced a to an

1382
00:35:31,349 --> 00:35:31,359
we are we have advanced a to an
 

1383
00:35:31,359 --> 00:35:33,390
we are we have advanced a to an
astonishing degree in our capacity for

1384
00:35:33,390 --> 00:35:33,400
astonishing degree in our capacity for
 

1385
00:35:33,400 --> 00:35:37,079
astonishing degree in our capacity for
data retrieval and for transmission and

1386
00:35:37,079 --> 00:35:37,089
data retrieval and for transmission and
 

1387
00:35:37,089 --> 00:35:40,380
data retrieval and for transmission and
so you know I would send YouTube I would

1388
00:35:40,380 --> 00:35:40,390
so you know I would send YouTube I would
 

1389
00:35:40,390 --> 00:35:43,019
so you know I would send YouTube I would
send no it really like think of all that

1390
00:35:43,019 --> 00:35:43,029
send no it really like think of all that
 

1391
00:35:43,029 --> 00:35:48,440
send no it really like think of all that
you know I I still feel so lucky that

1392
00:35:48,440 --> 00:35:48,450
you know I I still feel so lucky that
 

1393
00:35:48,450 --> 00:35:52,620
you know I I still feel so lucky that
there's any great musical artists of the

1394
00:35:52,620 --> 00:35:52,630
there's any great musical artists of the
 

1395
00:35:52,630 --> 00:35:56,160
there's any great musical artists of the
last hundred years who I revere I can

1396
00:35:56,160 --> 00:35:56,170
last hundred years who I revere I can
 

1397
00:35:56,170 --> 00:35:58,769
last hundred years who I revere I can
just find them and watch them and listen

1398
00:35:58,769 --> 00:35:58,779
just find them and watch them and listen
 

1399
00:35:58,779 --> 00:36:02,130
just find them and watch them and listen
to them and you know that's fantastic I

1400
00:36:02,130 --> 00:36:02,140
to them and you know that's fantastic I
 

1401
00:36:02,140 --> 00:36:05,130
to them and you know that's fantastic I
also love how democratic it is that we

1402
00:36:05,130 --> 00:36:05,140
also love how democratic it is that we
 

1403
00:36:05,140 --> 00:36:09,509
also love how democratic it is that we
each become curators that we each decide

1404
00:36:09,509 --> 00:36:09,519
each become curators that we each decide
 

1405
00:36:09,519 --> 00:36:13,019
each become curators that we each decide
those things now I may not agree with

1406
00:36:13,019 --> 00:36:13,029
those things now I may not agree with
 

1407
00:36:13,029 --> 00:36:16,470
those things now I may not agree with
you know those the choices that everyone

1408
00:36:16,470 --> 00:36:16,480
you know those the choices that everyone
 

1409
00:36:16,480 --> 00:36:18,299
you know those the choices that everyone
makes but of course not because that's

1410
00:36:18,299 --> 00:36:18,309
makes but of course not because that's
 

1411
00:36:18,309 --> 00:36:20,849
makes but of course not because that's
not the point the point is is that we

1412
00:36:20,849 --> 00:36:20,859
not the point the point is is that we
 

1413
00:36:20,859 --> 00:36:23,999
not the point the point is is that we

1467
00:37:50,890 --> 00:37:54,000
that we live in has really grown by
leaps and bounds and probably we've

people that watched it it's just it's
crazy it's so crazy Pat for instance uh

1570
00:40:35,870 --> 00:40:35,880
crazy it's so crazy Pat for instance uh
 

1571
00:40:35,880 --> 00:40:39,990
crazy it's so crazy Pat for instance uh
my son had a cerebral hemorrhage here

1572
00:40:39,990 --> 00:40:40,000
my son had a cerebral hemorrhage here
 

1573
00:40:40,000 --> 00:40:45,090
my son had a cerebral hemorrhage here
ago and the doctor who saved his life in

1574
00:40:45,090 --> 00:40:45,100
ago and the doctor who saved his life in
 

1575
00:40:45,100 --> 00:40:51,000
ago and the doctor who saved his life in
a very dangerous situation when he

1576
00:40:51,000 --> 00:40:51,010
a very dangerous situation when he
 

1577
00:40:51,010 --> 00:40:54,900
a very dangerous situation when he
realized that you know that Sam and I

1578
00:40:54,900 --> 00:40:54,910
realized that you know that Sam and I
 

1579
00:40:54,910 --> 00:40:57,320
realized that you know that Sam and I
were who we were

1580
00:40:57,320 --> 00:40:57,330
were who we were
 

1581
00:40:57,330 --> 00:41:00,750
were who we were
he said that's why I'm here you know he

1582
00:41:00,750 --> 00:41:00,760
he said that's why I'm here you know he
 

1583
00:41:00,760 --> 00:41:02,820
he said that's why I'm here you know he
said if you come of age in a poor

calls you to science when you're a child
then then you know you go to medicine

1590
00:41:13,140 --> 00:41:13,150
then then you know you go to medicine
 

1591
00:41:13,150 --> 00:41:13,650
then then you know you go to medicine
because

1592
00:41:13,650 --> 00:41:13,660
because
 

1593
00:41:13,660 --> 00:41:15,900
because
the only Avenue open to you but that's

1594
00:41:15,900 --> 00:41:15,910
the only Avenue open to you but that's
 

1595
00:41:15,910 --> 00:41:17,250
the only Avenue open to you but that's
why I'm here

why I'm here
 

1597
00:41:17,260 --> 00:41:20,279
why I'm here
and I have heard that story and I hear

1598
00:41:20,279 --> 00:41:20,289
and I have heard that story and I hear
 

1599
00:41:20,289 --> 00:41:25,319
and I have heard that story and I hear
that story I think every week how does

1600
00:41:25,319 --> 00:41:25,329
that story I think every week how does
 

1601
00:41:25,329 --> 00:41:27,510
that story I think every week how does
that make you feel I mean I the the

1602
00:41:27,510 --> 00:41:27,520
that make you feel I mean I the the
 

1603
00:41:27,520 --> 00:41:30,299
that make you feel I mean I the the
number of scientists I mean a lot of it

1604
00:41:30,299 --> 00:41:30,309
number of scientists I mean a lot of it
 

1605
00:41:30,309 --> 00:41:32,130
number of scientists I mean a lot of it
is quiet right but the number of

1606
00:41:32,130 --> 00:41:32,140
is quiet right but the number of
 

1607
00:41:32,140 --> 00:41:35,609
is quiet right but the number of
scientists cosmos has created is just

1608
00:41:35,609 --> 00:41:35,619
scientists cosmos has created is just
 

1609
00:41:35,619 --> 00:41:37,559
scientists cosmos has created is just
countless I mean it probably touched a

1610
00:41:37,559 --> 00:41:37,569
countless I mean it probably touched a
 

1611
00:41:37,569 --> 00:41:39,660
countless I mean it probably touched a
lives I don't know probably it could be

1612
00:41:39,660 --> 00:41:39,670
lives I don't know probably it could be
 

1613
00:41:39,670 --> 00:41:42,299
lives I don't know probably it could be
a crazy number of the 90% of scientists

1614
00:41:42,299 --> 00:41:42,309
a crazy number of the 90% of scientists
 

1615
00:41:42,309 --> 00:41:44,309
a crazy number of the 90% of scientists
or something I'd have been I was going

1616
00:41:44,309 --> 00:41:44,319
or something I'd have been I was going
 

1617
00:41:44,319 --> 00:41:47,760
or something I'd have been I was going
to do that census because I because

1618
00:41:47,760 --> 00:41:47,770
to do that census because I because
 

1619
00:41:47,770 --> 00:41:48,950
to do that census because I because
that's the month the greatest

1620
00:41:48,950 --> 00:41:48,960
that's the month the greatest
 

1621
00:41:48,960 --> 00:41:50,970
that's the month the greatest
gratification because that's the dream

1622
00:41:50,970 --> 00:41:50,980
gratification because that's the dream
 

1623
00:41:50,980 --> 00:41:53,370
gratification because that's the dream
of science and that's the whole idea is

1624
00:41:53,370 --> 00:41:53,380
of science and that's the whole idea is
 

1625
00:41:53,380 --> 00:41:56,370
of science and that's the whole idea is
that if it belongs to all of us and not

1626
00:41:56,370 --> 00:41:56,380
that if it belongs to all of us and not
 

1627
00:41:56,380 --> 00:41:59,430
that if it belongs to all of us and not
just a tiny few then we have some chance

1628
00:41:59,430 --> 00:41:59,440
just a tiny few then we have some chance
 

1629
00:41:59,440 --> 00:42:03,750
just a tiny few then we have some chance
of determining how it's used and if it's

1630
00:42:03,750 --> 00:42:03,760
of determining how it's used and if it's
 

1631
00:42:03,760 --> 00:42:07,099
of determining how it's used and if it's
only in the hands of people whose only

1632
00:42:07,099 --> 00:42:07,109
only in the hands of people whose only
 

1633
00:42:07,109 --> 00:42:11,339
only in the hands of people whose only
whose only interests are the balance

1634
00:42:11,339 --> 00:42:11,349
whose only interests are the balance

sheet or hegemony over other nations or
 

1637
00:42:15,880 --> 00:42:19,289
sheet or hegemony over other nations or
things like that then it'll probably end

1638
00:42:19,289 --> 00:42:19,299
things like that then it'll probably end
 

1639
00:42:19,299 --> 00:42:23,370
things like that then it'll probably end
up being a gun aimed in our heads but if

1640
00:42:23,370 --> 00:42:23,380
up being a gun aimed in our heads but if
 

1641
00:42:23,380 --> 00:42:26,160
up being a gun aimed in our heads but if
it's distributed in the widest possible

it's distributed in the widest possible

it's distributed in the widest possible
way a capability that we now have

way a capability that we now have
 

1645
00:42:29,670 --> 00:42:32,849
way a capability that we now have
because of our technology then this

1646
00:42:32,849 --> 00:42:32,859
because of our technology then this
 

1647
00:42:32,859 --> 00:42:36,750
because of our technology then this
chance is that that it'll be used with

1648
00:42:36,750 --> 00:42:36,760
chance is that that it'll be used with
 

1649
00:42:36,760 --> 00:42:39,240
chance is that that it'll be used with
wisdom that's that's the dream of it so

1650
00:42:39,240 --> 00:42:39,250
wisdom that's that's the dream of it so
 

1651
00:42:39,250 --> 00:42:42,120
wisdom that's that's the dream of it so
that's that's why we did the first

1652
00:42:42,120 --> 00:42:42,130
that's that's why we did the first
 

1653
00:42:42,130 --> 00:42:45,809
that's that's why we did the first
cosmos we wanted to take not just as I

00:42:45,809 --> 00:42:45,819
cosmos we wanted to take not just as I

00:42:58,680 --> 00:42:58,690
this a series in the second and third
 

1663
00:42:58,690 --> 00:43:04,079
this a series in the second and third
seasons the the primary interest was

1664
00:43:04,079 --> 00:43:04,089
seasons the the primary interest was
 

1665
00:43:04,089 --> 00:43:07,380
seasons the the primary interest was
that we wouldn't tell a story unless it

1666
00:43:07,380 --> 00:43:07,390
that we wouldn't tell a story unless it
 

1667
00:43:07,390 --> 00:43:09,359
that we wouldn't tell a story unless it
was a kind of a three-fer you know it

00:43:09,359 --> 00:43:09,369
was a kind of a three-fer you know it
 

1669
00:43:09,369 --> 00:43:11,730

was not just a way to understand a new
 

1671
00:43:11,740 --> 00:43:16,339
was not just a way to understand a new
sign a scientific idea but it was also a

00:43:16,339 --> 00:43:16,349
sign a scientific idea but it was also a
 

1673
00:43:16,349 --> 00:43:19,920
sign a scientific idea but it was also a
way to understand what if it matters

way to understand what if it matters

what's true wow the world can change for

00:43:23,910 --> 00:43:23,920
what's true wow the world can change for
 

1677
00:43:23,920 --> 00:43:26,470
what's true wow the world can change for

and if it doesn't matter what's true
then we're in grave danger because we

00:43:32,650 --> 00:43:32,660
then we're in grave danger because we
 

1683
00:43:32,660 --> 00:43:36,520
then we're in grave danger because we
have the capability to not only destroy

have the capability to not only destroy

ourselves and our civilization but to
 

1687
00:43:39,349 --> 00:43:42,609
ourselves and our civilization but to
take so many species with us and I'd

take so many species with us and I'd
 

1689
00:43:42,619 --> 00:43:44,560
take so many species with us and I'd
like to talk to you about that

1690
00:43:44,560 --> 00:43:44,570
like to talk to you about that
 

1691
00:43:44,570 --> 00:43:46,780
like to talk to you about that

00:43:46,790 --> 00:43:49,480
particular the sort of the dangers of
ourselves in a little bit but sort of to

MacFarlane became our champion because I

1708
00:44:16,210 --> 00:44:16,220
MacFarlane became our champion because I
 

1709
00:44:16,220 --> 00:44:19,300
MacFarlane became our champion because I
had been with three colleagues I had

had been with three colleagues I had

00:44:19,310 --> 00:44:21,760
had been with three colleagues I had
been slapping around from network to

00:44:21,760 --> 00:44:21,770
been slapping around from network to
 

1713
00:44:21,770 --> 00:44:25,390
been slapping around from network to
network with a treatment for cosmos and

1714
00:44:25,390 --> 00:44:25,400
network with a treatment for cosmos and
 

1715
00:44:25,400 --> 00:44:28,170
network with a treatment for cosmos and
every network said they wanted to do it

1716
00:44:28,170 --> 00:44:28,180
every network said they wanted to do it
 

1717
00:44:28,180 --> 00:44:30,430
every network said they wanted to do it
but they wouldn't give me creative

1718
00:44:30,430 --> 00:44:30,440
but they wouldn't give me creative
 

1719
00:44:30,440 --> 00:44:32,920
but they wouldn't give me creative
control and they wouldn't give me enough

1720
00:44:32,920 --> 00:44:32,930
control and they wouldn't give me enough
 

1721
00:44:32,930 --> 00:44:37,569

there's Einstein years later looking up
 

1883
00:48:39,499 --> 00:48:42,789
there's Einstein years later looking up
at that picture of Faraday to inspire

1884
00:48:42,789 --> 00:48:42,799
at that picture of Faraday to inspire
 

1885

at that picture of Faraday to inspire
him there so it's you know if we had

1886
00:48:47,910 --> 00:48:47,920
him there so it's you know if we had
 

1887
00:48:47,920 --> 00:48:51,880
him there so it's you know if we had
people we've had kind of humility and

people we've had kind of humility and
 

1889
00:48:51,890 --> 00:48:54,969
people we've had kind of humility and

Faraday created the wealth of the 20th
century with his various inventions and

century with his various inventions and
 

1897
00:49:04,549 --> 00:49:07,299
century with his various inventions and
yet he never took out a single patent at

1898
00:49:07,299 --> 00:49:07,309
yet he never took out a single patent at
 

1899
00:49:07,309 --> 00:49:08,949
yet he never took out a single patent at
a time when people were patenting

1900
00:49:08,949 --> 00:49:08,959
a time when people were patenting
 

1901
00:49:08,959 --> 00:49:12,219
a time when people were patenting
everything because that was not what he

00:49:12,219 --> 00:49:12,229
everything because that was not what he
 

1903
00:49:12,229 --> 00:49:14,289
everything because that was not what he
was about and to me that's a kind of

1904
00:49:14,289 --> 00:49:14,299
was about and to me that's a kind of
 

1905
00:49:14,299 --> 00:49:19,329
was about and to me that's a kind of

life this tremendous gratification from
 

1911
00:49:26,119 --> 00:49:30,339
life this tremendous gratification from
searching and it's just so impressive to

1912
00:49:30,339 --> 00:49:30,349
searching and it's just so impressive to
 

1913
00:49:30,349 --> 00:49:32,259
searching and it's just so impressive to
me and there are so many other people in

not just you know the the worlds that we
might visit but also the world that this

you asked me what is common to all three

1936
00:50:05,109 --> 00:50:05,119
you asked me what is common to all three
 

1937
00:50:05,119 --> 00:50:06,370
you asked me what is common to all three
seasons of

1938

seasons of
 

1939
00:50:06,380 --> 00:50:08,920
seasons of
what is that voice it's the voice of

1940
00:50:08,920 --> 00:50:08,930
what is that voice it's the voice of
 

1941
00:50:08,930 --> 00:50:12,670
what is that voice it's the voice of
hope it's a voice that says there is the

1942
00:50:12,670 --> 00:50:12,680
hope it's a voice that says there is the
 

1943
00:50:12,680 --> 00:50:16,510
hope it's a voice that says there is the

think fairly dazzling fashion that we
 

1947
00:50:19,730 --> 00:50:22,540
think fairly dazzling fashion that we
can still have you know and in sitting

1948
00:50:22,540 --> 00:50:22,550
can still have you know and in sitting
 

1949
00:50:22,550 --> 00:50:24,640
can still have you know and in sitting
down to imagine what this season would

1950
00:50:24,640 --> 00:50:24,650
down to imagine what this season would
 

1951
00:50:24,650 --> 00:50:27,250
down to imagine what this season would
be the new season I'd be sitting where I

1952
00:50:27,250 --> 00:50:27,260
be the new season I'd be sitting where I
 

1953

be the new season I'd be sitting where I
live in Ithaca beautiful trees

live in Ithaca beautiful trees
 

1955
00:50:32,480 --> 00:50:35,350
live in Ithaca beautiful trees
everywhere waterfalls yeah you're

1956
00:50:35,350 --> 00:50:35,360
everywhere waterfalls yeah you're
 

1957
00:50:35,360 --> 00:50:37,600
everywhere waterfalls yeah you're
sitting there thinking well you can't

1958
00:50:37,600 --> 00:50:37,610
sitting there thinking well you can't
 

1959
00:50:37,610 --> 00:50:41,650
sitting there thinking well you can't
how do you how do you awaken people I

1960
00:50:41,650 --> 00:50:41,660
how do you how do you awaken people I
 

1961
00:50:41,660 --> 00:50:43,510
how do you how do you awaken people I
mean you can't yell at them and say

1962
00:50:43,510 --> 00:50:43,520
mean you can't yell at them and say
 

1963
00:50:43,520 --> 00:50:45,970
mean you can't yell at them and say
we're all gonna die no it's not it

1964
00:50:45,970 --> 00:50:45,980
we're all gonna die no it's not it
 

1965
00:50:45,980 --> 00:50:51,070
we're all gonna die no it's not it
doesn't help it doesn't help but I think

1966
00:50:51,070 --> 00:50:51,080
doesn't help it doesn't help but I think
 

1967
00:50:51,080 --> 00:50:55,960
doesn't help it doesn't help but I think
if you give them a vision of the future

1968
00:50:55,960 --> 00:50:55,970
if you give them a vision of the future
 

1969
00:50:55,970 --> 00:50:58,480
if you give them a vision of the future
that's not pie in the sky but something

1970
00:50:58,480 --> 00:50:58,490
that's not pie in the sky but something
 

1971
00:50:58,490 --> 00:51:01,210
that's not pie in the sky but something

the ways in which science can be
 

1973
00:51:01,220 --> 00:51:05,920
the ways in which science can be
redemptive can actually remediate our

1974

redemptive can actually remediate our
 

1975
00:51:05,930 --> 00:51:09,070
redemptive can actually remediate our
future we have those capabilities right

1976
00:51:09,070 --> 00:51:09,080
future we have those capabilities right
 

1977
00:51:09,080 --> 00:51:13,600
future we have those capabilities right
now as well as the capabilities to do

1978
00:51:13,600 --> 00:51:13,610
now as well as the capabilities to do
 

1979
00:51:13,610 --> 00:51:16,300
now as well as the capabilities to do
things in the cosmos that we could be

1980
00:51:16,300 --> 00:51:16,310
things in the cosmos that we could be
 

1981
00:51:16,310 --> 00:51:18,220
things in the cosmos that we could be
doing right now but we're not doing them

1982
00:51:18,220 --> 00:51:18,230
doing right now but we're not doing them
 

1983
00:51:18,230 --> 00:51:22,570
doing right now but we're not doing them
not because we don't know how to how you

1984
00:51:22,570 --> 00:51:22,580
not because we don't know how to how you
 

1985
00:51:22,580 --> 00:51:24,190
not because we don't know how to how you
know with the engineering or the

1986
00:51:24,190 --> 00:51:24,200
know with the engineering or the
 

1987
00:51:24,200 --> 00:51:26,590
know with the engineering or the
material sciences or the physics we know

1988
00:51:26,590 --> 00:51:26,600
material sciences or the physics we know
 

1989
00:51:26,600 --> 00:51:29,890
material sciences or the physics we know
all we need to know but we're a little

1990
00:51:29,890 --> 00:51:29,900
all we need to know but we're a little
 

1991
00:51:29,900 --> 00:51:34,360
all we need to know but we're a little
bit paralyzed in some sense and you know

1992
00:51:34,360 --> 00:51:34,370
bit paralyzed in some sense and you know
 

1993
00:51:34,370 --> 00:51:35,800
bit paralyzed in some sense and you know
we're like I always think we're like the

1994
00:51:35,800 --> 00:51:35,810
we're like I always think we're like the
 

1995
00:51:35,810 --> 00:51:39,280
we're like I always think we're like the
toddler you know like we we left our

1996
00:51:39,280 --> 00:51:39,290
toddler you know like we we left our
 

1997
00:51:39,290 --> 00:51:41,680
toddler you know like we we left our
mothers legs you know and scurried out

1998
00:51:41,680 --> 00:51:41,690
mothers legs you know and scurried out
 

1999
00:51:41,690 --> 00:51:44,500
mothers legs you know and scurried out
to the moon yeah and we had a moment of

2000
00:51:44,500 --> 00:51:44,510
to the moon yeah and we had a moment of
 

2001
00:51:44,510 --> 00:51:47,400
to the moon yeah and we had a moment of
wow we can do this and then we realized

2002
00:51:47,400 --> 00:51:47,410
wow we can do this and then we realized
 

2003
00:51:47,410 --> 00:51:50,380
wow we can do this and then we realized
and somehow we had a failure of nerve

2004
00:51:50,380 --> 00:51:50,390
and somehow we had a failure of nerve
 

2005
00:51:50,390 --> 00:51:52,600
and somehow we had a failure of nerve
and we went scurrying back to our mother

2006
00:51:52,600 --> 00:51:52,610
and we went scurrying back to our mother
 

2007
00:51:52,610 --> 00:51:55,120
and we went scurrying back to our mother
and you know did things that really

2008
00:51:55,120 --> 00:51:55,130
and you know did things that really
 

2009
00:51:55,130 --> 00:51:56,860
and you know did things that really
weren't gonna get us out there like a

2010
00:51:56,860 --> 00:51:56,870
weren't gonna get us out there like a
 

2011
00:51:56,870 --> 00:51:59,650
weren't gonna get us out there like a
Space Shuttle things like that because

2012
00:51:59,650 --> 00:51:59,660
Space Shuttle things like that because
 

2013
00:51:59,660 --> 00:52:02,500
Space Shuttle things like that because
it was a kind of failure of nerve so

2014
00:52:02,500 --> 00:52:02,510
it was a kind of failure of nerve so
 

2015
00:52:02,510 --> 00:52:06,340
it was a kind of failure of nerve so
cosmos is about overcoming those fears

2016
00:52:06,340 --> 00:52:06,350
cosmos is about overcoming those fears
 

2017
00:52:06,350 --> 00:52:09,070
cosmos is about overcoming those fears
we're now as a civilization ready to be

2018
00:52:09,070 --> 00:52:09,080
we're now as a civilization ready to be
 

2019
00:52:09,080 --> 00:52:11,530
we're now as a civilization ready to be

a teenager venturing out into college
 

2021
00:52:11,540 --> 00:52:14,490
a teenager venturing out into college
we're returning back exactly you're

2022
00:52:14,490 --> 00:52:14,500
we're returning back exactly you're
 

2023
00:52:14,500 --> 00:52:16,870
we're returning back exactly you're
exactly and that and that's one of my

2024
00:52:16,870 --> 00:52:16,880
exactly and that and that's one of my
 

2025
00:52:16,880 --> 00:52:19,990
exactly and that and that's one of my
theories about our current

2026
00:52:19,990 --> 00:52:20,000
theories about our current
 

2027
00:52:20,000 --> 00:52:23,890
theories about our current
situation is that this is our

but you know the vast majority of people

2044
00:52:52,420 --> 00:52:52,430
but you know the vast majority of people

my hope is for our civilization on a
 

2051
00:53:02,950 --> 00:53:05,980
my hope is for our civilization on a
sort of darker and more difficult

00:56:28,609 --> 00:56:31,039
population events skeptical about
climate change because I think that the

2186
00:56:31,039 --> 00:56:31,049
climate change because I think that the
 

2187
00:56:31,049 --> 00:56:35,269
climate change because I think that the
extreme weather fire events that we are

2188
00:56:35,269 --> 00:56:35,279
extreme weather fire events that we are
 

2189
00:56:35,279 --> 00:56:39,079
extreme weather fire events that we are
experiencing with such frequency it's

2190
00:56:39,079 --> 00:56:39,089
experiencing with such frequency it's
 

2191
00:56:39,089 --> 00:56:42,380
experiencing with such frequency it's
really gotten to people I think there I

2192
00:56:42,380 --> 00:56:42,390
really gotten to people I think there I
 

2193
00:56:42,390 --> 00:56:44,630
really gotten to people I think there I
think that there are people in

2194
00:56:44,630 --> 00:56:44,640
think that there are people in
 

2195
00:56:44,640 --> 00:56:46,370
think that there are people in
leadership position

2196
00:56:46,370 --> 00:56:46,380
leadership position
 

2197
00:56:46,380 --> 00:56:50,450
leadership position
who choose to ignore it and to pretend

2198
00:56:50,450 --> 00:56:50,460
who choose to ignore it and to pretend
 

2199
00:56:50,460 --> 00:56:53,150
who choose to ignore it and to pretend
it's not there but ultimately I think

2200
00:56:53,150 --> 00:56:53,160
it's not there but ultimately I think
 

2201
00:56:53,160 --> 00:56:56,180
it's not there but ultimately I think
they will be rejected the question is

2202
00:56:56,180 --> 00:56:56,190
they will be rejected the question is
 

2203
00:56:56,190 --> 00:56:59,809
they will be rejected the question is
will it be fast enough but you know this

2204
00:56:59,809 --> 00:56:59,819
will it be fast enough but you know this
 

2205
00:56:59,819 --> 00:57:03,079
will it be fast enough but you know this
I don't I think actually that most

2206
00:57:03,079 --> 00:57:03,089
I don't I think actually that most
 

2207
00:57:03,089 --> 00:57:07,190
I don't I think actually that most
people have really finally taken the

2208
00:57:07,190 --> 00:57:07,200
people have really finally taken the
 

2209
00:57:07,200 --> 00:57:09,979
people have really finally taken the
reality of global climate change to

2210
00:57:09,979 --> 00:57:09,989
reality of global climate change to
 

2211
00:57:09,989 --> 00:57:12,799
reality of global climate change to
heart and they look at their children

2212
00:57:12,799 --> 00:57:12,809
heart and they look at their children
 

2213
00:57:12,809 --> 00:57:13,789
heart and they look at their children
and grandchildren

2214
00:57:13,789 --> 00:57:13,799
and grandchildren
 

2215
00:57:13,799 --> 00:57:17,739
and grandchildren
and they don't feel good because they

2216
00:57:17,739 --> 00:57:17,749
and they don't feel good because they
 

2217
00:57:17,749 --> 00:57:21,200
and they don't feel good because they
come from a world which was in many ways

2218
00:57:21,200 --> 00:57:21,210
come from a world which was in many ways
 

2219
00:57:21,210 --> 00:57:24,979
come from a world which was in many ways
in terms of climate fairly familiar and

2220
00:57:24,979 --> 00:57:24,989
in terms of climate fairly familiar and
 

2221
00:57:24,989 --> 00:57:27,620
in terms of climate fairly familiar and
benign and they know that we're headed

2222
00:57:27,620 --> 00:57:27,630
benign and they know that we're headed
 

2223
00:57:27,630 --> 00:57:29,390
benign and they know that we're headed
in another direction and it's not just

2224
00:57:29,390 --> 00:57:29,400
in another direction and it's not just
 

2225
00:57:29,400 --> 00:57:32,299
in another direction and it's not just
that it's what we do to the oceans the

2226
00:57:32,299 --> 00:57:32,309
that it's what we do to the oceans the
 

2227
00:57:32,309 --> 00:57:35,690
that it's what we do to the oceans the
rivers the air you know I mean you asked

2228
00:57:35,690 --> 00:57:35,700
rivers the air you know I mean you asked
 

2229
00:57:35,700 --> 00:57:38,239
rivers the air you know I mean you asked
me like what is what is the message of

2230
00:57:38,239 --> 00:57:38,249
me like what is what is the message of
 

2231
00:57:38,249 --> 00:57:43,519
me like what is what is the message of
cosmos is it's that is that we have to

2232
00:57:43,519 --> 00:57:43,529
cosmos is it's that is that we have to
 

2233
00:57:43,529 --> 00:57:47,150
cosmos is it's that is that we have to
think in longer terms you know I think

2234
00:57:47,150 --> 00:57:47,160
think in longer terms you know I think
 

2235
00:57:47,160 --> 00:57:49,279
think in longer terms you know I think
of the Soviet Union United States in the

2236
00:57:49,279 --> 00:57:49,289
of the Soviet Union United States in the
 

2237
00:57:49,289 --> 00:57:51,380
of the Soviet Union United States in the
Cold War and they're ready to kill each

2238
00:57:51,380 --> 00:57:51,390
Cold War and they're ready to kill each
 

2239
00:57:51,390 --> 00:57:53,870
Cold War and they're ready to kill each
other over these two different views of

2240
00:57:53,870 --> 00:57:53,880
other over these two different views of
 

2241
00:57:53,880 --> 00:57:57,589
other over these two different views of
the distribution of resources but

2242
00:57:57,589 --> 00:57:57,599
the distribution of resources but
 

2243
00:57:57,599 --> 00:58:01,609
the distribution of resources but
neither of them has a form of human

2244
00:58:01,609 --> 00:58:01,619
neither of them has a form of human
 

2245
00:58:01,619 --> 00:58:03,979
neither of them has a form of human
social organization that thinks in terms

2246
00:58:03,979 --> 00:58:03,989
social organization that thinks in terms
 

2247
00:58:03,989 --> 00:58:06,769
social organization that thinks in terms
of a hundred years let alone a thousand

2248
00:58:06,769 --> 00:58:06,779
of a hundred years let alone a thousand
 

2249
00:58:06,779 --> 00:58:09,890
of a hundred years let alone a thousand
years which are the timescales that

2250
00:58:09,890 --> 00:58:09,900
years which are the timescales that
 

2251
00:58:09,900 --> 00:58:12,769
years which are the timescales that
science speaks in and that's part of the

2252
00:58:12,769 --> 00:58:12,779
science speaks in and that's part of the
 

2253
00:58:12,779 --> 00:58:16,640
science speaks in and that's part of the
problem is that we have to get a grip on

2254
00:58:16,640 --> 00:58:16,650
problem is that we have to get a grip on
 

2255
00:58:16,650 --> 00:58:21,200
problem is that we have to get a grip on
reality and where we're headed and it's

2256
00:58:21,200 --> 00:58:21,210
reality and where we're headed and it's
 

2257
00:58:21,210 --> 00:58:26,120
reality and where we're headed and it's
I I'm not fatalistic at all but I do

2258
00:58:26,120 --> 00:58:26,130
I I'm not fatalistic at all but I do
 

2259
00:58:26,130 --> 00:58:29,289
I I'm not fatalistic at all but I do
feel like it you and in setting out to

2260
00:58:29,289 --> 00:58:29,299
feel like it you and in setting out to
 

2261
00:58:29,299 --> 00:58:33,279
feel like it you and in setting out to
to do this series each season we were

2262
00:58:33,279 --> 00:58:33,289
to do this series each season we were
 

2263
00:58:33,289 --> 00:58:36,079
to do this series each season we were
talking about climate change in the

2264
00:58:36,079 --> 00:58:36,089
talking about climate change in the
 

2265
00:58:36,089 --> 00:58:39,729
talking about climate change in the
original cosmos in Episode four and

2266
00:58:39,729 --> 00:58:39,739
original cosmos in Episode four and
 

2267
00:58:39,739 --> 00:58:42,380
original cosmos in Episode four and
warning about inadvertent climate

2268
00:58:42,380 --> 00:58:42,390
warning about inadvertent climate
 

2269
00:58:42,390 --> 00:58:44,420
warning about inadvertent climate
modification in 1980

2270
00:58:44,420 --> 00:58:44,430
modification in 1980
 

2271
00:58:44,430 --> 00:58:48,109
modification in 1980
you know and of course Carl did his PhD

2272
00:58:48,109 --> 00:58:48,119
you know and of course Carl did his PhD
 

2273
00:58:48,119 --> 00:58:50,150
you know and of course Carl did his PhD
thesis on the greenhouse effect on Venus

2274
00:58:50,150 --> 00:58:50,160
thesis on the greenhouse effect on Venus
 

2275
00:58:50,160 --> 00:58:53,900
thesis on the greenhouse effect on Venus
and he was painfully cognizant of it

2276
00:58:53,900 --> 00:58:53,910
and he was painfully cognizant of it
 

2277
00:58:53,910 --> 00:58:56,089
and he was painfully cognizant of it
when a runaway greenhouse effect would

2278
00:58:56,089 --> 00:58:56,099
when a runaway greenhouse effect would
 

2279
00:58:56,099 --> 00:58:58,940
when a runaway greenhouse effect would
do to our planet and not only that but

2280
00:58:58,940 --> 00:58:58,950
do to our planet and not only that but
 

2281
00:58:58,950 --> 00:58:59,400
do to our planet and not only that but
the climb

2282
00:58:59,400 --> 00:58:59,410
the climb
 

2283
00:58:59,410 --> 00:59:01,500
the climb
history of the planet which we go into

2284
00:59:01,500 --> 00:59:01,510
history of the planet which we go into
 

2285
00:59:01,510 --> 00:59:05,849
history of the planet which we go into
in great detail in the series so yeah I

2286
00:59:05,849 --> 00:59:05,859
in great detail in the series so yeah I
 

2287
00:59:05,859 --> 00:59:08,039
in great detail in the series so yeah I
mean how are we gonna get a grip on this

2288
00:59:08,039 --> 00:59:08,049
mean how are we gonna get a grip on this
 

2289
00:59:08,049 --> 00:59:10,650
mean how are we gonna get a grip on this
if not through some kind of

2290
00:59:10,650 --> 00:59:10,660
if not through some kind of
 

2291
00:59:10,660 --> 00:59:14,700
if not through some kind of
understanding of science can I just say

2292
00:59:14,700 --> 00:59:14,710
understanding of science can I just say
 

2293
00:59:14,710 --> 00:59:17,490
understanding of science can I just say
one more thing about science is that its

2294
00:59:17,490 --> 00:59:17,500
one more thing about science is that its
 

2295
00:59:17,500 --> 00:59:22,789
one more thing about science is that its
powers of prophecy are astonishing you

2296
00:59:22,789 --> 00:59:22,799
powers of prophecy are astonishing you
 

2297
00:59:22,799 --> 00:59:28,849
powers of prophecy are astonishing you
launch a spacecraft in 1977 and you know

2298
00:59:28,849 --> 00:59:28,859
launch a spacecraft in 1977 and you know
 

2299
00:59:28,859 --> 00:59:31,890
launch a spacecraft in 1977 and you know
where each and every planet in the solar

2300
00:59:31,890 --> 00:59:31,900
where each and every planet in the solar
 

2301
00:59:31,900 --> 00:59:34,799
where each and every planet in the solar
system is going to be in every moon and

2302
00:59:34,799 --> 00:59:34,809
system is going to be in every moon and
 

2303
00:59:34,809 --> 00:59:38,160
system is going to be in every moon and
you rendezvous with that flawlessly and

2304
00:59:38,160 --> 00:59:38,170
you rendezvous with that flawlessly and
 

2305
00:59:38,170 --> 00:59:41,220
you rendezvous with that flawlessly and
you exceed the design specifications of

2306
00:59:41,220 --> 00:59:41,230
you exceed the design specifications of
 

2307
00:59:41,230 --> 00:59:44,160
you exceed the design specifications of
the greatest dreams that the engineers

2308
00:59:44,160 --> 00:59:44,170
the greatest dreams that the engineers
 

2309
00:59:44,170 --> 00:59:48,120
the greatest dreams that the engineers
and then you go on to explore the Milky

2310
00:59:48,120 --> 00:59:48,130
and then you go on to explore the Milky
 

2311
00:59:48,130 --> 00:59:51,120
and then you go on to explore the Milky
Way galaxy and you do it I mean you know

2312
00:59:51,120 --> 00:59:51,130
Way galaxy and you do it I mean you know
 

2313
00:59:51,130 --> 00:59:53,789
Way galaxy and you do it I mean you know
the climate scientists some of the

2314
00:59:53,789 --> 00:59:53,799
the climate scientists some of the
 

2315
00:59:53,799 --> 00:59:56,370
the climate scientists some of the
people that we use stories we tell in

2316
00:59:56,370 --> 00:59:56,380
people that we use stories we tell in
 

2317
00:59:56,380 --> 01:00:01,559
people that we use stories we tell in
cosmos they their predictions were and

2318
01:00:01,559 --> 01:00:01,569
cosmos they their predictions were and
 

2319
01:00:01,569 --> 01:00:04,740
cosmos they their predictions were and
they were working with very early

2320
01:00:04,740 --> 01:00:04,750
they were working with very early
 

2321
01:00:04,750 --> 01:00:08,160
they were working with very early
computer modeling capabilities they have

2322
01:00:08,160 --> 01:00:08,170
computer modeling capabilities they have
 

2323
01:00:08,170 --> 01:00:11,099
computer modeling capabilities they have
proven to be so robust nuclear winter

2324
01:00:11,099 --> 01:00:11,109
proven to be so robust nuclear winter
 

2325
01:00:11,109 --> 01:00:13,589
proven to be so robust nuclear winter
all of these things this is a prophetic

2326
01:00:13,589 --> 01:00:13,599
all of these things this is a prophetic
 

2327
01:00:13,599 --> 01:00:16,859
all of these things this is a prophetic
power and yet how crazy that you know

2328
01:00:16,859 --> 01:00:16,869
power and yet how crazy that you know
 

2329
01:00:16,869 --> 01:00:19,650
power and yet how crazy that you know
it's like it's like the Romans with

2330
01:00:19,650 --> 01:00:19,660
it's like it's like the Romans with
 

2331
01:00:19,660 --> 01:00:22,500
it's like it's like the Romans with
their lead cooking pots and their lead

2332
01:00:22,500 --> 01:00:22,510
their lead cooking pots and their lead
 

2333
01:00:22,510 --> 01:00:25,589
their lead cooking pots and their lead
pipes or the Aztecs ripping out their

2334
01:00:25,589 --> 01:00:25,599
pipes or the Aztecs ripping out their
 

2335
01:00:25,599 --> 01:00:29,519
pipes or the Aztecs ripping out their
own people's hearts this is us we know

2336
01:00:29,519 --> 01:00:29,529
own people's hearts this is us we know
 

2337
01:00:29,529 --> 01:00:32,970
own people's hearts this is us we know
better and yet we are acting as if it's

2338
01:00:32,970 --> 01:00:32,980
better and yet we are acting as if it's
 

2339
01:00:32,980 --> 01:00:37,710
better and yet we are acting as if it's

speaking of which let me ask a tough

2344
01:00:44,760 --> 01:00:44,770
speaking of which let me ask a tough
 

2345
01:00:44,770 --> 01:00:46,980
speaking of which let me ask a tough
question I guess because there's so many

2346
01:00:46,980 --> 01:00:46,990
question I guess because there's so many
 

2347
01:00:46,990 --> 01:00:49,049
question I guess because there's so many
possible answers but what aspect of life

2348
01:00:49,049 --> 01:00:49,059
possible answers but what aspect of life
 

2349
01:00:49,059 --> 01:00:50,490
possible answers but what aspect of life
here on earth do you find most

2350
01:00:50,490 --> 01:00:50,500
here on earth do you find most
 

2351
01:00:50,500 --> 01:00:53,370
here on earth do you find most
fascinating from the origin of life the

2352
01:00:53,370 --> 01:00:53,380
fascinating from the origin of life the
 

2353
01:00:53,380 --> 01:00:55,920
fascinating from the origin of life the
evolutionary process itself the origin

2354
01:00:55,920 --> 01:00:55,930
evolutionary process itself the origin
 

2355
01:00:55,930 --> 01:00:59,690
evolutionary process itself the origin
of the human mind so intelligence the

some of the technological developments

2358
01:01:02,069 --> 01:01:02,079
some of the technological developments
 

2359
01:01:02,079 --> 01:01:04,019
some of the technological developments
going on now or us venturing out into

2360
01:01:04,019 --> 01:01:04,029
going on now or us venturing out into
 

2361
01:01:04,029 --> 01:01:06,240
going on now or us venturing out into
space or space exploration what just

2362
01:01:06,240 --> 01:01:06,250
space or space exploration what just
 

2363
01:01:06,250 --> 01:01:11,190
space or space exploration what just
inspires you inspire me but I just say

2364
01:01:11,190 --> 01:01:11,200
inspires you inspire me but I just say
 

2365
01:01:11,200 --> 01:01:12,810
inspires you inspire me but I just say
that to me

2366
01:01:12,810 --> 01:01:12,820
that to me
 

2367
01:01:12,820 --> 01:01:15,210
that to me
at the archana as I've gotten older to

2368
01:01:15,210 --> 01:01:15,220
at the archana as I've gotten older to
 

2369
01:01:15,220 --> 01:01:19,280
at the archana as I've gotten older to
me the origin of life has become less

2370
01:01:19,280 --> 01:01:19,290
me the origin of life has become less
 

2371
01:01:19,290 --> 01:01:21,840
me the origin of life has become less
interesting interesting well because I

2372
01:01:21,840 --> 01:01:21,850
interesting interesting well because I
 

2373
01:01:21,850 --> 01:01:25,290
interesting interesting well because I
feel well not because it's more I think

2374
01:01:25,290 --> 01:01:25,300
feel well not because it's more I think
 

2375
01:01:25,300 --> 01:01:29,580
feel well not because it's more I think
I understand I have a better grasp of

01:01:29,580 --> 01:01:29,590
I understand I have a better grasp of
 

2377
01:01:29,590 --> 01:01:31,920
I understand I have a better grasp of
how it might have happened do you think

2378
01:01:31,920 --> 01:01:31,930
how it might have happened do you think
 

2379
01:01:31,930 --> 01:01:34,200
how it might have happened do you think
it was a huge leap so I may think it was

2380
01:01:34,200 --> 01:01:34,210
it was a huge leap so I may think it was
 

2381
01:01:34,210 --> 01:01:37,380
it was a huge leap so I may think it was
that we are a byproduct of geophysics

2382
01:01:37,380 --> 01:01:37,390
that we are a byproduct of geophysics
 

2383
01:01:37,390 --> 01:01:42,150
that we are a byproduct of geophysics
and I think it's not I my suspicion of

2384
01:01:42,150 --> 01:01:42,160
and I think it's not I my suspicion of
 

2385
01:01:42,160 --> 01:01:44,910
and I think it's not I my suspicion of
course which is taking it with a grain

2386
01:01:44,910 --> 01:01:44,920
course which is taking it with a grain
 

2387
01:01:44,920 --> 01:01:48,900
course which is taking it with a grain
of salt but my suspicion is that it

2388
01:01:48,900 --> 01:01:48,910
of salt but my suspicion is that it
 

2389
01:01:48,910 --> 01:01:51,870
of salt but my suspicion is that it
happens more often and more places than

2390
01:01:51,870 --> 01:01:51,880
happens more often and more places than
 

2391

happens more often and more places than
we like to think because you know after

01:01:54,570 --> 01:01:54,580
we like to think because you know after
 

2393
01:01:54,580 --> 01:01:56,820
we like to think because you know after
all the history of our thinking about

01:01:56,820 --> 01:01:56,830
all the history of our thinking about
 

2395
01:01:56,830 --> 01:01:59,880
all the history of our thinking about
ourselves there's been a constant series

2396
01:01:59,880 --> 01:01:59,890
ourselves there's been a constant series
 

2397
01:01:59,890 --> 01:02:01,800
ourselves there's been a constant series
of demotions in which we've had you

2398
01:02:01,800 --> 01:02:01,810
of demotions in which we've had you
 

2399
01:02:01,810 --> 01:02:05,430
of demotions in which we've had you
realize no no so to me that's not at the

01:02:05,430 --> 01:02:05,440
realize no no so to me that's not at the

2403
01:02:07,900 --> 01:02:11,190
center of the origin of consciousness is
to me also not so amazing if you think

2404
01:02:11,190 --> 01:02:11,200
to me also not so amazing if you think
 

2405
01:02:11,200 --> 01:02:13,460
to me also not so amazing if you think
of it as you know going back to these

2406
01:02:13,460 --> 01:02:13,470
of it as you know going back to these
 

2407
01:02:13,470 --> 01:02:16,950
of it as you know going back to these
one celled organisms of a billion years

2408
01:02:16,950 --> 01:02:16,960
one celled organisms of a billion years
 

2409
01:02:16,960 --> 01:02:21,900
one celled organisms of a billion years
ago who had had to know well if I go

2410
01:02:21,900 --> 01:02:21,910
ago who had had to know well if I go
 

2411
01:02:21,910 --> 01:02:22,500
ago who had had to know well if I go
higher up

2412
01:02:22,500 --> 01:02:22,510
higher up
 

2413
01:02:22,510 --> 01:02:25,590
higher up
I'll get too much Sun and if I go lower

2414
01:02:25,590 --> 01:02:25,600
I'll get too much Sun and if I go lower
 

2415
01:02:25,600 --> 01:02:28,980
I'll get too much Sun and if I go lower
down not I'll be protected from you know

2416
01:02:28,980 --> 01:02:28,990
down not I'll be protected from you know
 

2417
01:02:28,990 --> 01:02:31,920
down not I'll be protected from you know
UV rays things like that they have to

2418
01:02:31,920 --> 01:02:31,930
UV rays things like that they have to
 

2419
01:02:31,930 --> 01:02:34,620
UV rays things like that they have to
know that or you I eat me I don't I mean

2420
01:02:34,620 --> 01:02:34,630
know that or you I eat me I don't I mean
 

2421
01:02:34,630 --> 01:02:37,610
know that or you I eat me I don't I mean
even that I can see if you know that

2422
01:02:37,610 --> 01:02:37,620
even that I can see if you know that
 

2423
01:02:37,620 --> 01:02:41,130
even that I can see if you know that
then knowing what we know now it's just

2424
01:02:41,130 --> 01:02:41,140
then knowing what we know now it's just
 

2425
01:02:41,140 --> 01:02:44,310
then knowing what we know now it's just
it's not so hard to fathom it seems like

2426
01:02:44,310 --> 01:02:44,320
it's not so hard to fathom it seems like
 

2427
01:02:44,320 --> 01:02:47,580
it's not so hard to fathom it seems like
you know there's I never believed there

2428
01:02:47,580 --> 01:02:47,590
you know there's I never believed there
 

2429
01:02:47,590 --> 01:02:49,890
you know there's I never believed there
was a duality between our minds and our

2430
01:02:49,890 --> 01:02:49,900
was a duality between our minds and our
 

2431
01:02:49,900 --> 01:02:52,620
was a duality between our minds and our
bodies and I think that even

2432
01:02:52,620 --> 01:02:52,630
bodies and I think that even
 

2433
01:02:52,630 --> 01:02:55,740
bodies and I think that even
consciousness all those seem to me

2434
01:02:55,740 --> 01:02:55,750
consciousness all those seem to me
 

2435
01:02:55,750 --> 01:03:02,960
consciousness all those seem to me
except my Oh physics chemistry yes

geochemistry geophysics absolutely of

2438
01:03:05,750 --> 01:03:05,760
geochemistry geophysics absolutely of
 

2439
01:03:05,760 --> 01:03:08,370
geochemistry geophysics absolutely of
you know it makes perfect sense to me

2440
01:03:08,370 --> 01:03:08,380
you know it makes perfect sense to me
 

2441
01:03:08,380 --> 01:03:11,490
you know it makes perfect sense to me
and it doesn't make it any less wondrous

2442
01:03:11,490 --> 01:03:11,500
and it doesn't make it any less wondrous
 

2443
01:03:11,500 --> 01:03:17,610
and it doesn't make it any less wondrous
it it doesn't wrap it at all of the

2444
01:03:17,610 --> 01:03:17,620
it it doesn't wrap it at all of the
 

2445
01:03:17,620 --> 01:03:20,910
it it doesn't wrap it at all of the
wonder of it and so yeah I think that's

2446
01:03:20,910 --> 01:03:20,920
wonder of it and so yeah I think that's
 

2447
01:03:20,920 --> 01:03:23,610
wonder of it and so yeah I think that's
amazing I think you know we tell the

2448
01:03:23,610 --> 01:03:23,620
amazing I think you know we tell the
 

2449
01:03:23,620 --> 01:03:25,819
amazing I think you know we tell the
story of someone you have never heard of

2450
01:03:25,819 --> 01:03:25,829
story of someone you have never heard of
 

2451
01:03:25,829 --> 01:03:27,499
story of someone you have never heard of
I guarantee and I think you're very

2452
01:03:27,499 --> 01:03:27,509
I guarantee and I think you're very
 

2453
01:03:27,509 --> 01:03:31,719
I guarantee and I think you're very
knowledgeable of a subject who was more

2454
01:03:31,719 --> 01:03:31,729
knowledgeable of a subject who was more
 

2455
01:03:31,729 --> 01:03:34,519
knowledgeable of a subject who was more
responsible for our ability to venture

2456
01:03:34,519 --> 01:03:34,529
responsible for our ability to venture
 

2457
01:03:34,529 --> 01:03:37,429
responsible for our ability to venture
out to other worlds when anyone else and

2458
01:03:37,429 --> 01:03:37,439
out to other worlds when anyone else and
 

2459
01:03:37,439 --> 01:03:40,969
out to other worlds when anyone else and
who was completely forgotten and so

2460
01:03:40,969 --> 01:03:40,979
who was completely forgotten and so
 

2461
01:03:40,979 --> 01:03:43,099
who was completely forgotten and so
those are the kinds of stories I like

2462
01:03:43,099 --> 01:03:43,109
those are the kinds of stories I like
 

2463
01:03:43,109 --> 01:03:50,509
those are the kinds of stories I like
best for cosmos you tell me who buy my

2464
01:03:50,509 --> 01:03:50,519
best for cosmos you tell me who buy my
 

2465
01:03:50,519 --> 01:03:54,559
best for cosmos you tell me who buy my
book you know but I'm just saying like

2466
01:03:54,559 --> 01:03:54,569
book you know but I'm just saying like
 

2467
01:03:54,569 --> 01:03:58,039
book you know but I'm just saying like
this person would be forgotten but you

2468
01:03:58,039 --> 01:03:58,049
this person would be forgotten but you
 

2469
01:03:58,049 --> 01:04:00,769
this person would be forgotten but you
know I you just the way that we do

2470
01:04:00,769 --> 01:04:00,779
know I you just the way that we do
 

2471
01:04:00,779 --> 01:04:04,039
know I you just the way that we do
cosmos is that like I ask a question to

2472
01:04:04,039 --> 01:04:04,049
cosmos is that like I ask a question to
 

2473
01:04:04,049 --> 01:04:06,259
cosmos is that like I ask a question to
myself we really want to get to the

2474
01:04:06,259 --> 01:04:06,269
myself we really want to get to the
 

2475
01:04:06,269 --> 01:04:08,660
myself we really want to get to the
bottom to the answer and keep going

2476
01:04:08,660 --> 01:04:08,670
bottom to the answer and keep going
 

2477
01:04:08,670 --> 01:04:11,150
bottom to the answer and keep going
deeper deeper until we find what the

2478
01:04:11,150 --> 01:04:11,160
deeper deeper until we find what the
 

2479
01:04:11,160 --> 01:04:14,120
deeper deeper until we find what the
story is a story that I know because I'm

2480
01:04:14,120 --> 01:04:14,130
story is a story that I know because I'm
 

2481
01:04:14,130 --> 01:04:17,989
story is a story that I know because I'm
not a scientist if it moves me if it if

2482
01:04:17,989 --> 01:04:17,999
not a scientist if it moves me if it if
 

2483
01:04:17,999 --> 01:04:20,390
not a scientist if it moves me if it if
it moves me then I want to tell it and

2484
01:04:20,390 --> 01:04:20,400
it moves me then I want to tell it and
 

2485
01:04:20,400 --> 01:04:21,620
it moves me then I want to tell it and
other people be moved

2486
01:04:21,620 --> 01:04:21,630
other people be moved
 

2487
01:04:21,630 --> 01:04:25,969
other people be moved
do you ponder mortality yes human

2488
01:04:25,969 --> 01:04:25,979
do you ponder mortality yes human
 

2489
01:04:25,979 --> 01:04:28,099
do you ponder mortality yes human
mortality and maybe even your own

2490
01:04:28,099 --> 01:04:28,109
mortality and maybe even your own
 

2491
01:04:28,109 --> 01:04:29,959
mortality and maybe even your own
mortality oh all the time

2492
01:04:29,959 --> 01:04:29,969
mortality oh all the time
 

2493
01:04:29,969 --> 01:04:33,199
