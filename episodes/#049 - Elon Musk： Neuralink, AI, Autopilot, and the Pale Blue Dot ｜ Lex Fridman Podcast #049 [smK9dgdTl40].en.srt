it feels like consciousness is in a

it feels like consciousness is in a

00:04:25,230 --> 00:04:27,350
it feels like consciousness is in a
different dimension but this is this

different dimension but this is this
 

201

you know if you damnit damage your brain

204
00:04:33,520 --> 00:04:33,530
you know if you damnit damage your brain

in some way physically you get you you
 

207
00:04:36,440 --> 00:04:38,980
in some way physically you get you you
damage your consciousness which implies

00:04:38,980 --> 00:04:38,990
damage your consciousness which implies
 

209
00:04:38,990 --> 00:04:40,600
damage your consciousness which implies
that consciousness is a physical

210
00:04:40,600 --> 00:04:40,610
that consciousness is a physical
 

211
00:04:40,610 --> 00:04:44,740
that consciousness is a physical
phenomenon and in my view the thing is

212
00:04:44,740 --> 00:04:44,750
phenomenon and in my view the thing is
 

213
00:04:44,750 --> 00:04:46,900
phenomenon and in my view the thing is
that that I think are really quite quite

that that I think are really quite quite
 

215
00:04:46,910 --> 00:04:49,510
that that I think are really quite quite
likely is that digital intelligence will

likely is that digital intelligence will
 

217
00:04:49,520 --> 00:04:52,720
likely is that digital intelligence will
be able to out think us in every way and

218
00:04:52,720 --> 00:04:52,730
be able to out think us in every way and
 

219
00:04:52,730 --> 00:04:54,730
be able to out think us in every way and
it will soon be able to simulate what we

220
00:04:54,730 --> 00:04:54,740
it will soon be able to simulate what we

00:04:54,740 --> 00:04:57,760
it will soon be able to simulate what we
consider consciousness so to agree that

consider consciousness so to agree that
 

223
00:04:57,770 --> 00:04:58,870
consider consciousness so to agree that
you would not be able to tell the

00:04:58,870 --> 00:04:58,880
you would not be able to tell the
 

225
00:04:58,880 --> 00:05:00,850
you would not be able to tell the
difference and from the from the aspect

00:05:00,850 --> 00:05:00,860
difference and from the from the aspect
 

227
00:05:00,860 --> 00:05:02,800
difference and from the from the aspect
of the scientific method it's it might

228
00:05:02,800 --> 00:05:02,810
of the scientific method it's it might
 

229
00:05:02,810 --> 00:05:04,450
of the scientific method it's it might
as well be consciousness if we can

230
00:05:04,450 --> 00:05:04,460
as well be consciousness if we can
 

231
00:05:04,460 --> 00:05:06,880
as well be consciousness if we can
simulate it perfectly if you can't tell

232
00:05:06,880 --> 00:05:06,890
simulate it perfectly if you can't tell
 

233
00:05:06,890 --> 00:05:09,910
simulate it perfectly if you can't tell
the difference and this is sort of the

234
00:05:09,910 --> 00:05:09,920
the difference and this is sort of the
 

235
00:05:09,920 --> 00:05:11,770
the difference and this is sort of the
Turing test but think of a more sort of

236
00:05:11,770 --> 00:05:11,780
Turing test but think of a more sort of
 

237
00:05:11,780 --> 00:05:14,230
Turing test but think of a more sort of
advanced version of the Turing test if

00:05:14,230 --> 00:05:14,240
advanced version of the Turing test if
 

239

not represent a public safety risk just
as there is a regulatory authority for

there's a potential danger to the public
 

347
00:07:37,030 --> 00:07:42,030
there's a potential danger to the public
I would argue that AI is unequivocally

348
00:07:42,030 --> 00:07:42,040
I would argue that AI is unequivocally
 

349
00:07:42,040 --> 00:07:44,170
I would argue that AI is unequivocally
something that has potential to be

something that has potential to be
 

351
00:07:44,180 --> 00:07:45,640
something that has potential to be
dangerous to the public and therefore

352
00:07:45,640 --> 00:07:45,650
dangerous to the public and therefore
 

353
00:07:45,650 --> 00:07:47,860
dangerous to the public and therefore
should have a regulatory agency just as

354
00:07:47,860 --> 00:07:47,870
should have a regulatory agency just as
 

355
00:07:47,870 --> 00:07:49,420
should have a regulatory agency just as
other things that are dangerous to the

other things that are dangerous to the
 

357
00:07:49,430 --> 00:07:52,780
other things that are dangerous to the
public have a regulatory agency but let

358
00:07:52,780 --> 00:07:52,790
public have a regulatory agency but let
 

359
00:07:52,790 --> 00:07:53,980
public have a regulatory agency but let
me tell you problems with this is that

360
00:07:53,980 --> 00:07:53,990
me tell you problems with this is that
 

361
00:07:53,990 --> 00:07:57,610
me tell you problems with this is that
the government was very slowly and the

rate of the usually way a regulatory
 

365
00:08:00,650 --> 00:08:04,260
rate of the usually way a regulatory
agency comes into being is that

366
00:08:04,260 --> 00:08:04,270
agency comes into being is that
 

367
00:08:04,270 --> 00:08:06,300
agency comes into being is that
something terrible happens

368
00:08:06,300 --> 00:08:06,310
something terrible happens

there's a huge public outcry and years
 

371
00:08:09,830 --> 00:08:12,670
there's a huge public outcry and years
after that there's a regulatory agency

372
00:08:12,670 --> 00:08:12,680
after that there's a regulatory agency
 

373
00:08:12,680 --> 00:08:15,040
after that there's a regulatory agency
or rule put in place takes something

389
00:08:36,050 --> 00:08:39,070

yeah and and honor hundreds of thousands

yeah and and honor hundreds of thousands
 

391
00:08:39,080 --> 00:08:40,899
yeah and and honor hundreds of thousands
of people probably died because of that

of people probably died because of that
 

393
00:08:40,909 --> 00:08:43,450

and they said people wouldn't buy cars
 

395
00:08:43,460 --> 00:08:46,020

they want you to affect that probability
and have it be more good than bad well

on so we currently understand very
 

453
00:10:02,230 --> 00:10:04,170
on so we currently understand very
little about the human brain do you also

454
00:10:04,170 --> 00:10:04,180
little about the human brain do you also

little about the human brain do you also
hope that the work at neural link will

456

hope that the work at neural link will
 

457
00:10:07,480 --> 00:10:11,040
hope that the work at neural link will
help us understand more about our about

458
00:10:11,040 --> 00:10:11,050
help us understand more about our about
 

459
00:10:11,050 --> 00:10:13,680
help us understand more about our about
the human mind about the brain yeah the

460
00:10:13,680 --> 00:10:13,690
the human mind about the brain yeah the
 

461
00:10:13,690 --> 00:10:15,750
the human mind about the brain yeah the
work in your like will definitely shut a

462
00:10:15,750 --> 00:10:15,760
work in your like will definitely shut a
 

463
00:10:15,760 --> 00:10:18,510
work in your like will definitely shut a
lot of insight into how the brain the

464
00:10:18,510 --> 00:10:18,520
lot of insight into how the brain the
 

465
00:10:18,520 --> 00:10:21,630
lot of insight into how the brain the
mind works right now just the data we

466
00:10:21,630 --> 00:10:21,640
mind works right now just the data we
 

467
00:10:21,640 --> 00:10:23,430
mind works right now just the data we
have regarding the how the brain works

468
00:10:23,430 --> 00:10:23,440
have regarding the how the brain works
 

469
00:10:23,440 --> 00:10:29,070
have regarding the how the brain works
is very limited we've collect fMRI which

470
00:10:29,070 --> 00:10:29,080
is very limited we've collect fMRI which
 

471
00:10:29,080 --> 00:10:30,870
is very limited we've collect fMRI which
is that that's kind of like putting us

472
00:10:30,870 --> 00:10:30,880
is that that's kind of like putting us
 

473
00:10:30,880 --> 00:10:33,690
is that that's kind of like putting us
you know a stethoscope on the outside of

00:10:33,690 --> 00:10:33,700
you know a stethoscope on the outside of
 

475
00:10:33,700 --> 00:10:36,000
you know a stethoscope on the outside of
a factory wall and then putting it like

476
00:10:36,000 --> 00:10:36,010
a factory wall and then putting it like
 

477
00:10:36,010 --> 00:10:37,200
a factory wall and then putting it like
all over the factory wall and you can

478
00:10:37,200 --> 00:10:37,210
all over the factory wall and you can
 

479
00:10:37,210 --> 00:10:39,090
all over the factory wall and you can
sort of hear the sounds but you don't

480
00:10:39,090 --> 00:10:39,100
sort of hear the sounds but you don't
 

481
00:10:39,100 --> 00:10:41,270
sort of hear the sounds but you don't
know what machines are doing really yeah

482
00:10:41,270 --> 00:10:41,280
know what machines are doing really yeah
 

483
00:10:41,280 --> 00:10:44,100
know what machines are doing really yeah
it's hard you can infer a few things but

484
00:10:44,100 --> 00:10:44,110
it's hard you can infer a few things but
 

485
00:10:44,110 --> 00:10:46,830
it's hard you can infer a few things but
it's very poor brushstroke in order to

486
00:10:46,830 --> 00:10:46,840
it's very poor brushstroke in order to
 

487
00:10:46,840 --> 00:10:48,030
it's very poor brushstroke in order to
really know what's going on in the brain

488
00:10:48,030 --> 00:10:48,040
really know what's going on in the brain
 

489
00:10:48,040 --> 00:10:49,260
really know what's going on in the brain
you really need you have to have high

490
00:10:49,260 --> 00:10:49,270
you really need you have to have high
 

491
00:10:49,270 --> 00:10:51,510
you really need you have to have high
precision sensors and then you want to

492
00:10:51,510 --> 00:10:51,520
precision sensors and then you want to
 

493
00:10:51,520 --> 00:10:54,000
precision sensors and then you want to
have stimulus and response like if you

494
00:10:54,000 --> 00:10:54,010
have stimulus and response like if you
 

495
00:10:54,010 --> 00:10:56,190
have stimulus and response like if you
trigger a new one what how do you feel

496
00:10:56,190 --> 00:10:56,200
trigger a new one what how do you feel
 

497
00:10:56,200 --> 00:10:58,290
trigger a new one what how do you feel
what do you see how does it change your

498
00:10:58,290 --> 00:10:58,300
what do you see how does it change your
 

499
00:10:58,300 --> 00:11:00,180
what do you see how does it change your
perception of the world you're speaking

500
00:11:00,180 --> 00:11:00,190
perception of the world you're speaking
 

501
00:11:00,190 --> 00:11:01,920
perception of the world you're speaking
to physically just getting close to the

502
00:11:01,920 --> 00:11:01,930
to physically just getting close to the
 

503
00:11:01,930 --> 00:11:03,390
to physically just getting close to the
brain being able to measure signals on

504
00:11:03,390 --> 00:11:03,400
brain being able to measure signals on
 

505
00:11:03,400 --> 00:11:05,820
brain being able to measure signals on
the brain yeah will give us sort of open

506
00:11:05,820 --> 00:11:05,830
the brain yeah will give us sort of open
 

507
00:11:05,830 --> 00:11:09,550
the brain yeah will give us sort of open
the door and inside the factory yes

508
00:11:09,550 --> 00:11:09,560
the door and inside the factory yes
 

509
00:11:09,560 --> 00:11:10,989
the door and inside the factory yes
being able to have high precision

510
00:11:10,989 --> 00:11:10,999
being able to have high precision
 

511
00:11:10,999 --> 00:11:14,949
being able to have high precision
sensors that tell you what individual

512
00:11:14,949 --> 00:11:14,959
sensors that tell you what individual
 

513
00:11:14,959 --> 00:11:16,750
sensors that tell you what individual
neurons are doing

514
00:11:16,750 --> 00:11:16,760
neurons are doing
 

515
00:11:16,760 --> 00:11:19,360
neurons are doing
and then being able to trigger a neuron

516
00:11:19,360 --> 00:11:19,370
and then being able to trigger a neuron
 

517
00:11:19,370 --> 00:11:21,210
and then being able to trigger a neuron
and see what the responses in the brain

518
00:11:21,210 --> 00:11:21,220
and see what the responses in the brain
 

519
00:11:21,220 --> 00:11:25,840
and see what the responses in the brain
so you can see the consequences of if

520
00:11:25,840 --> 00:11:25,850
so you can see the consequences of if
 

521
00:11:25,850 --> 00:11:28,330
so you can see the consequences of if
you fire this neuron what happens how do

522
00:11:28,330 --> 00:11:28,340
you fire this neuron what happens how do
 

523
00:11:28,340 --> 00:11:29,850
you fire this neuron what happens how do
you feel what is change

524
00:11:29,850 --> 00:11:29,860
you feel what is change
 

525
00:11:29,860 --> 00:11:32,380
you feel what is change
it'll be really profound to have this in

526
00:11:32,380 --> 00:11:32,390
it'll be really profound to have this in
 

527
00:11:32,390 --> 00:11:34,740
it'll be really profound to have this in
people because people can articulate

528
00:11:34,740 --> 00:11:34,750
people because people can articulate
 

529
00:11:34,750 --> 00:11:38,650
people because people can articulate
their change like if there's a change in

530
00:11:38,650 --> 00:11:38,660
their change like if there's a change in
 

531
00:11:38,660 --> 00:11:41,440
their change like if there's a change in
mood or if they've you know if they can

532
00:11:41,440 --> 00:11:41,450
mood or if they've you know if they can
 

533
00:11:41,450 --> 00:11:43,630
mood or if they've you know if they can
tell you if they can see better or hear

534
00:11:43,630 --> 00:11:43,640
tell you if they can see better or hear
 

535
00:11:43,640 --> 00:11:46,990
tell you if they can see better or hear
better or be able to form sentences

536
00:11:46,990 --> 00:11:47,000
better or be able to form sentences
 

537
00:11:47,000 --> 00:11:49,390

00:11:49,390 --> 00:11:49,400
better or worse or you know their
 

539
00:11:49,400 --> 00:11:51,910
better or worse or you know their
memories are jogged or that kinda kind

540
00:11:51,910 --> 00:11:51,920
memories are jogged or that kinda kind
 

541
00:11:51,920 --> 00:11:52,300
memories are jogged or that kinda kind
of thing

542
00:11:52,300 --> 00:11:52,310
of thing
 

543
00:11:52,310 --> 00:11:54,760
of thing
so on the human side there's this

544
00:11:54,760 --> 00:11:54,770
so on the human side there's this
 

545
00:11:54,770 --> 00:11:56,650
so on the human side there's this
incredible general malleability

546
00:11:56,650 --> 00:11:56,660
incredible general malleability
 

547
00:11:56,660 --> 00:11:58,930
incredible general malleability
plasticity of the human brain the human

548
00:11:58,930 --> 00:11:58,940
plasticity of the human brain the human
 

549
00:11:58,940 --> 00:12:01,450
plasticity of the human brain the human
brain adapts adjusts and so on so it's

550
00:12:01,450 --> 00:12:01,460
brain adapts adjusts and so on so it's
 

551
00:12:01,460 --> 00:12:03,490
brain adapts adjusts and so on so it's
not that plastic to be totally Frank so

552
00:12:03,490 --> 00:12:03,500
not that plastic to be totally Frank so
 

553
00:12:03,500 --> 00:12:05,440
not that plastic to be totally Frank so
there's a firm structure but there

554
00:12:05,440 --> 00:12:05,450
there's a firm structure but there
 

555
00:12:05,450 --> 00:12:07,690
there's a firm structure but there
nevertheless there's some plasticity and

556
00:12:07,690 --> 00:12:07,700
nevertheless there's some plasticity and
 

557
00:12:07,700 --> 00:12:10,570
nevertheless there's some plasticity and
the open question is so if I could ask a

558
00:12:10,570 --> 00:12:10,580
the open question is so if I could ask a
 

559
00:12:10,580 --> 00:12:12,880
the open question is so if I could ask a
broad question is how much that

560
00:12:12,880 --> 00:12:12,890
broad question is how much that
 

561
00:12:12,890 --> 00:12:15,340
broad question is how much that
plasticity can be utilized sort of on

562
00:12:15,340 --> 00:12:15,350
plasticity can be utilized sort of on
 

563
00:12:15,350 --> 00:12:17,230
plasticity can be utilized sort of on
the human side there's some plasticity

564
00:12:17,230 --> 00:12:17,240
the human side there's some plasticity
 

565
00:12:17,240 --> 00:12:20,410
the human side there's some plasticity
in human brain and on the machine side

566
00:12:20,410 --> 00:12:20,420
in human brain and on the machine side
 

567
00:12:20,420 --> 00:12:24,430
in human brain and on the machine side
we have neural networks machine learning

568
00:12:24,430 --> 00:12:24,440
we have neural networks machine learning
 

569
00:12:24,440 --> 00:12:26,620
we have neural networks machine learning
artificial intelligence it's able to

570
00:12:26,620 --> 00:12:26,630
artificial intelligence it's able to
 

571
00:12:26,630 --> 00:12:28,780
artificial intelligence it's able to
adjust and figure out signals so there's

572
00:12:28,780 --> 00:12:28,790
adjust and figure out signals so there's
 

573
00:12:28,790 --> 00:12:31,300
adjust and figure out signals so there's
a mysterious language that we don't

574
00:12:31,300 --> 00:12:31,310
a mysterious language that we don't
 

575
00:12:31,310 --> 00:12:33,070
a mysterious language that we don't
perfectly understand that's within the

576
00:12:33,070 --> 00:12:33,080
perfectly understand that's within the
 

577
00:12:33,080 --> 00:12:35,410
perfectly understand that's within the
human brain and then we're trying to

578
00:12:35,410 --> 00:12:35,420
human brain and then we're trying to
 

579
00:12:35,420 --> 00:12:36,930
human brain and then we're trying to
understand that language to communicate

580
00:12:36,930 --> 00:12:36,940
understand that language to communicate
 

581
00:12:36,940 --> 00:12:40,000
understand that language to communicate
both directions so the brain is

582
00:12:40,000 --> 00:12:40,010
both directions so the brain is
 

583
00:12:40,010 --> 00:12:41,860
both directions so the brain is
adjusting a little bit we don't know how

584
00:12:41,860 --> 00:12:41,870
adjusting a little bit we don't know how
 

585
00:12:41,870 --> 00:12:44,890
adjusting a little bit we don't know how
much and the machine is adjusting where

586
00:12:44,890 --> 00:12:44,900
much and the machine is adjusting where
 

587
00:12:44,900 --> 00:12:47,470
much and the machine is adjusting where
do you see as they try to sort of reach

588
00:12:47,470 --> 00:12:47,480
do you see as they try to sort of reach
 

589
00:12:47,480 --> 00:12:49,180
do you see as they try to sort of reach
together almost like with an alien

590
00:12:49,180 --> 00:12:49,190
together almost like with an alien
 

591
00:12:49,190 --> 00:12:51,190
together almost like with an alien
species try to find a protocol

592
00:12:51,190 --> 00:12:51,200
species try to find a protocol
 

593
00:12:51,200 --> 00:12:54,220
species try to find a protocol
communication protocol that works where

594
00:12:54,220 --> 00:12:54,230
communication protocol that works where
 

595
00:12:54,230 --> 00:12:57,250
communication protocol that works where
do you see the biggest the the biggest

596
00:12:57,250 --> 00:12:57,260
do you see the biggest the the biggest
 

597
00:12:57,260 --> 00:12:58,690
do you see the biggest the the biggest
benefit arriving from on the machine

598
00:12:58,690 --> 00:12:58,700
benefit arriving from on the machine
 

599
00:12:58,700 --> 00:13:00,430
benefit arriving from on the machine
side or the human side do you see both

600
00:13:00,430 --> 00:13:00,440
side or the human side do you see both
 

601
00:13:00,440 --> 00:13:02,710
side or the human side do you see both
of them working together I think the

602
00:13:02,710 --> 00:13:02,720
of them working together I think the
 

603
00:13:02,720 --> 00:13:04,300
of them working together I think the
machine side is far more malleable and

604
00:13:04,300 --> 00:13:04,310
machine side is far more malleable and
 

605
00:13:04,310 --> 00:13:09,010
machine side is far more malleable and
the biological side well huge around so

606
00:13:09,010 --> 00:13:09,020
the biological side well huge around so
 

607
00:13:09,020 --> 00:13:11,770
the biological side well huge around so
it'll be the machine that adapts to the

608
00:13:11,770 --> 00:13:11,780
it'll be the machine that adapts to the
 

609
00:13:11,780 --> 00:13:13,570
it'll be the machine that adapts to the
brain that's the only thing that's

610
00:13:13,570 --> 00:13:13,580
brain that's the only thing that's
 

611
00:13:13,580 --> 00:13:15,340
brain that's the only thing that's
possible the brain can adapt that well

612
00:13:15,340 --> 00:13:15,350
possible the brain can adapt that well
 

613
00:13:15,350 --> 00:13:18,400
possible the brain can adapt that well
to to the machine you can't have neurons

614
00:13:18,400 --> 00:13:18,410
to to the machine you can't have neurons
 

615
00:13:18,410 --> 00:13:21,280
to to the machine you can't have neurons
start to regard an electrode as a nook

616
00:13:21,280 --> 00:13:21,290
start to regard an electrode as a nook
 

617
00:13:21,290 --> 00:13:23,200
start to regard an electrode as a nook
another neuron because you're not just

00:13:23,210 --> 00:13:25,450
another neuron because you're not just
dislike the pulse and so something else

620
00:13:25,450 --> 00:13:25,460
dislike the pulse and so something else
 

621
00:13:25,460 --> 00:13:27,750
dislike the pulse and so something else
is pulsing see so this there is that

622
00:13:27,750 --> 00:13:27,760
is pulsing see so this there is that
 

623
00:13:27,760 --> 00:13:30,220
is pulsing see so this there is that
there is that that elasticity in the

624
00:13:30,220 --> 00:13:30,230
there is that that elasticity in the
 

625
00:13:30,230 --> 00:13:30,610
there is that that elasticity in the
inner

626
00:13:30,610 --> 00:13:30,620
inner
 

627
00:13:30,620 --> 00:13:33,340
inner
which we believe is something that can

628
00:13:33,340 --> 00:13:33,350
which we believe is something that can
 

629
00:13:33,350 --> 00:13:35,800
which we believe is something that can
happen but the vast majority of

630
00:13:35,800 --> 00:13:35,810
happen but the vast majority of
 

631
00:13:35,810 --> 00:13:37,390
happen but the vast majority of
malleability will have to be on the

632
00:13:37,390 --> 00:13:37,400
malleability will have to be on the
 

633
00:13:37,400 --> 00:13:39,370
malleability will have to be on the
machine side but it's interesting when

634
00:13:39,370 --> 00:13:39,380
machine side but it's interesting when
 

635
00:13:39,380 --> 00:13:41,470
machine side but it's interesting when
you look at that synaptic plasticity at

636
00:13:41,470 --> 00:13:41,480
you look at that synaptic plasticity at
 

637
00:13:41,480 --> 00:13:44,470
you look at that synaptic plasticity at
the interface ID there might be like an

638
00:13:44,470 --> 00:13:44,480
the interface ID there might be like an
 

639
00:13:44,480 --> 00:13:47,500
the interface ID there might be like an
emergent plasticity because it's a whole

00:13:47,500 --> 00:13:47,510
emergent plasticity because it's a whole
 

641
00:13:47,510 --> 00:13:49,150
emergent plasticity because it's a whole
nother it's not like in the brain it's a

whole nother extension of the brain you
 

645
00:13:50,770 --> 00:13:53,590
whole nother extension of the brain you
know we might have to redefine what it

646
00:13:53,590 --> 00:13:53,600
know we might have to redefine what it
 

647
00:13:53,600 --> 00:13:56,380
know we might have to redefine what it
means to be malleable for the brain so

648
00:13:56,380 --> 00:13:56,390
means to be malleable for the brain so
 

649
00:13:56,390 --> 00:13:57,970
means to be malleable for the brain so
maybe the brain is able to adjust to

650
00:13:57,970 --> 00:13:57,980
maybe the brain is able to adjust to
 

651
00:13:57,980 --> 00:13:59,980
maybe the brain is able to adjust to
external interfaces there will be some

652
00:13:59,980 --> 00:13:59,990
external interfaces there will be some
 

653
00:13:59,990 --> 00:14:01,570
external interfaces there will be some
adjustment to the brain because there's

654
00:14:01,570 --> 00:14:01,580
adjustment to the brain because there's
 

655
00:14:01,580 --> 00:14:02,860
adjustment to the brain because there's
gonna be something reading and

656
00:14:02,860 --> 00:14:02,870
gonna be something reading and
 

657
00:14:02,870 --> 00:14:05,830
gonna be something reading and
simulating the the brain and so it will

658
00:14:05,830 --> 00:14:05,840
simulating the the brain and so it will
 

659
00:14:05,840 --> 00:14:11,290
simulating the the brain and so it will
adjust to to that thing but but well if

660
00:14:11,290 --> 00:14:11,300
adjust to to that thing but but well if
 

661
00:14:11,300 --> 00:14:12,730
adjust to to that thing but but well if
the vast majority the adjustment will be

662
00:14:12,730 --> 00:14:12,740
the vast majority the adjustment will be
 

663
00:14:12,740 --> 00:14:16,720
the vast majority the adjustment will be
on the machine side this is just if this

664
00:14:16,720 --> 00:14:16,730
on the machine side this is just if this
 

665
00:14:16,730 --> 00:14:18,610
on the machine side this is just if this
is just it has to be that otherwise it

666
00:14:18,610 --> 00:14:18,620
is just it has to be that otherwise it
 

667
00:14:18,620 --> 00:14:20,500
is just it has to be that otherwise it
will not work ultimately like we don't

668
00:14:20,500 --> 00:14:20,510
will not work ultimately like we don't
 

669
00:14:20,510 --> 00:14:21,910
will not work ultimately like we don't
currently operate on two layers we have

670
00:14:21,910 --> 00:14:21,920
currently operate on two layers we have
 

671
00:14:21,920 --> 00:14:24,010
currently operate on two layers we have
sort of lamech you like prime primitive

672
00:14:24,010 --> 00:14:24,020
sort of lamech you like prime primitive
 

673
00:14:24,020 --> 00:14:26,950
sort of lamech you like prime primitive
brain layer which is where all of our

brain layer which is where all of our
 

675
00:14:26,960 --> 00:14:29,650

00:14:29,650 --> 00:14:29,660
kind of impulses or coming from it's
 

677
00:14:29,660 --> 00:14:31,270
kind of impulses or coming from it's
sort of like we've got we've got like a

00:14:31,270 --> 00:14:31,280
sort of like we've got we've got like a
 

679
00:14:31,280 --> 00:14:33,420
sort of like we've got we've got like a
monkey brain with a computer stuck on it

680
00:14:33,420 --> 00:14:33,430
monkey brain with a computer stuck on it
 

681
00:14:33,430 --> 00:14:36,370
monkey brain with a computer stuck on it
that's that's the human brain and a lot

that's that's the human brain and a lot
 

683
00:14:36,380 --> 00:14:37,600
that's that's the human brain and a lot
of our impulses and everything are

00:14:37,600 --> 00:14:37,610
of our impulses and everything are
 

685
00:14:37,610 --> 00:14:40,000
of our impulses and everything are
driven by the monkey brain and the

00:14:40,000 --> 00:14:40,010
driven by the monkey brain and the
 

687
00:14:40,010 --> 00:14:42,880
driven by the monkey brain and the
computer of the cortex is constantly

688
00:14:42,880 --> 00:14:42,890
computer of the cortex is constantly
 

689
00:14:42,890 --> 00:14:43,960
computer of the cortex is constantly
trying to make the Montek monkey brain

690
00:14:43,960 --> 00:14:43,970
trying to make the Montek monkey brain
 

691
00:14:43,970 --> 00:14:46,260
trying to make the Montek monkey brain
happy it's not the cortex that's

692
00:14:46,260 --> 00:14:46,270
happy it's not the cortex that's
 

693
00:14:46,270 --> 00:14:47,920
happy it's not the cortex that's
steering the monkey right it's the

694
00:14:47,920 --> 00:14:47,930
steering the monkey right it's the
 

695
00:14:47,930 --> 00:14:50,430
steering the monkey right it's the
monkey brain steering the cortex you

696
00:14:50,430 --> 00:14:50,440
monkey brain steering the cortex you
 

697
00:14:50,440 --> 00:14:53,050
monkey brain steering the cortex you
know so the cortex is the part that

698
00:14:53,050 --> 00:14:53,060
know so the cortex is the part that
 

699
00:14:53,060 --> 00:14:55,120
know so the cortex is the part that
tells the story of the whole thing so we

700
00:14:55,120 --> 00:14:55,130
tells the story of the whole thing so we
 

701
00:14:55,130 --> 00:14:57,550
tells the story of the whole thing so we
convince ourselves it's more interesting

702
00:14:57,550 --> 00:14:57,560
convince ourselves it's more interesting
 

703
00:14:57,560 --> 00:14:59,740
convince ourselves it's more interesting
than just the monkey brain the cortex

704
00:14:59,740 --> 00:14:59,750
than just the monkey brain the cortex
 

705
00:14:59,750 --> 00:15:01,480
than just the monkey brain the cortex
just like what we'll call like human

706
00:15:01,480 --> 00:15:01,490
just like what we'll call like human
 

707
00:15:01,490 --> 00:15:03,070
just like what we'll call like human
intelligence you know it's like that's

00:15:03,070 --> 00:15:03,080
intelligence you know it's like that's
 

709
00:15:03,080 --> 00:15:05,050
intelligence you know it's like that's
like the advanced computer relative to

like the advanced computer relative to
 

711
00:15:05,060 --> 00:15:07,600
like the advanced computer relative to
other creatures like other creatures do

other creatures like other creatures do
 

713
00:15:07,610 --> 00:15:10,900
other creatures like other creatures do
not have either we're really they don't

00:15:10,900 --> 00:15:10,910
not have either we're really they don't
 

715
00:15:10,910 --> 00:15:13,060
not have either we're really they don't
they don't have the computer or they

716
00:15:13,060 --> 00:15:13,070
they don't have the computer or they
 

717
00:15:13,070 --> 00:15:15,760
they don't have the computer or they
have a very weak computer relative to

718
00:15:15,760 --> 00:15:15,770
have a very weak computer relative to
 

719
00:15:15,770 --> 00:15:17,340
have a very weak computer relative to
humans

720
00:15:17,340 --> 00:15:17,350
humans
 

721
00:15:17,350 --> 00:15:20,040
humans
but but it's just it's like it sort of

722
00:15:20,040 --> 00:15:20,050
but but it's just it's like it sort of
 

723
00:15:20,050 --> 00:15:22,440
but but it's just it's like it sort of
seems like surely the really smart thing

724
00:15:22,440 --> 00:15:22,450
seems like surely the really smart thing
 

725
00:15:22,450 --> 00:15:24,660
seems like surely the really smart thing
should control the dumb thing but

726
00:15:24,660 --> 00:15:24,670
should control the dumb thing but
 

727
00:15:24,670 --> 00:15:25,830
should control the dumb thing but
actually don't think it rolls this one

728
00:15:25,830 --> 00:15:25,840
actually don't think it rolls this one
 

729
00:15:25,840 --> 00:15:29,340
actually don't think it rolls this one
thing so do you think some of the same

730
00:15:29,340 --> 00:15:29,350
thing so do you think some of the same
 

731
00:15:29,350 --> 00:15:31,710
thing so do you think some of the same
kind of machine learning methods whether

732
00:15:31,710 --> 00:15:31,720
kind of machine learning methods whether
 

733
00:15:31,720 --> 00:15:33,260
kind of machine learning methods whether
that's natural language processing

734
00:15:33,260 --> 00:15:33,270
that's natural language processing
 

735
00:15:33,270 --> 00:15:35,880
that's natural language processing
applications are going to be applied for

736
00:15:35,880 --> 00:15:35,890
applications are going to be applied for
 

737
00:15:35,890 --> 00:15:37,470
applications are going to be applied for
the communication between the Machine

738
00:15:37,470 --> 00:15:37,480
the communication between the Machine
 

739
00:15:37,480 --> 00:15:41,700
the communication between the Machine
and the brain in to learn how to do

740
00:15:41,700 --> 00:15:41,710
and the brain in to learn how to do
 

741
00:15:41,710 --> 00:15:43,530
and the brain in to learn how to do
certain things like movement of the body

742
00:15:43,530 --> 00:15:43,540
certain things like movement of the body
 

743
00:15:43,540 --> 00:15:46,740
certain things like movement of the body
how to process visual stimuli and so on

744
00:15:46,740 --> 00:15:46,750
how to process visual stimuli and so on
 

745
00:15:46,750 --> 00:15:50,400
how to process visual stimuli and so on
do you see the value of using machine

746
00:15:50,400 --> 00:15:50,410
do you see the value of using machine
 

747
00:15:50,410 --> 00:15:52,190
do you see the value of using machine
learning to understand the language of

748
00:15:52,190 --> 00:15:52,200
learning to understand the language of
 

749
00:15:52,200 --> 00:15:54,930
learning to understand the language of
the two-way communication with the brain

750
00:15:54,930 --> 00:15:54,940
the two-way communication with the brain
 

751
00:15:54,940 --> 00:15:57,390
the two-way communication with the brain
yeah absolutely maybe we're a neural net

752
00:15:57,390 --> 00:15:57,400
yeah absolutely maybe we're a neural net
 

753
00:15:57,400 --> 00:16:01,980
yeah absolutely maybe we're a neural net
and that you know AI is basically known

754
00:16:01,980 --> 00:16:01,990
and that you know AI is basically known
 

755
00:16:01,990 --> 00:16:04,080
and that you know AI is basically known
that so it's like digital neural net

756
00:16:04,080 --> 00:16:04,090
that so it's like digital neural net
 

757
00:16:04,090 --> 00:16:05,820
that so it's like digital neural net
will interface with biological neural

758
00:16:05,820 --> 00:16:05,830
will interface with biological neural
 

759
00:16:05,830 --> 00:16:09,420
will interface with biological neural
net and hopefully bring us along for the

760
00:16:09,420 --> 00:16:09,430
net and hopefully bring us along for the
 

761
00:16:09,430 --> 00:16:11,460
net and hopefully bring us along for the
ride yeah but the vast majority of

762
00:16:11,460 --> 00:16:11,470
ride yeah but the vast majority of
 

763
00:16:11,470 --> 00:16:14,070
ride yeah but the vast majority of
aren't of our intelligence will be

764
00:16:14,070 --> 00:16:14,080
aren't of our intelligence will be
 

765
00:16:14,080 --> 00:16:18,660
aren't of our intelligence will be
digital there's no like so like things

766
00:16:18,660 --> 00:16:18,670
digital there's no like so like things
 

767
00:16:18,670 --> 00:16:21,480
digital there's no like so like things
like the the difference in intelligence

768
00:16:21,480 --> 00:16:21,490
like the the difference in intelligence
 

769
00:16:21,490 --> 00:16:23,460
like the the difference in intelligence
between your the cortex and limbic

770
00:16:23,460 --> 00:16:23,470
between your the cortex and limbic
 

771
00:16:23,470 --> 00:16:26,670
between your the cortex and limbic
system is gigantic your living system

00:16:33,570 --> 00:16:33,580
hell the cortex is doing it's just
 

777
00:16:33,580 --> 00:16:36,750
hell the cortex is doing it's just
literally hungry you know or tired or

00:16:36,750 --> 00:16:36,760
literally hungry you know or tired or
 

779
00:16:36,760 --> 00:16:41,100
literally hungry you know or tired or
angry or sexy or something you know it's

00:16:41,100 --> 00:16:41,110
angry or sexy or something you know it's
 

781
00:16:41,110 --> 00:16:44,700
angry or sexy or something you know it's
an ad just and then it that communicates

782
00:16:44,700 --> 00:16:44,710
an ad just and then it that communicates
 

783
00:16:44,710 --> 00:16:47,000
an ad just and then it that communicates
that's that impulse to the cortex and

784
00:16:47,000 --> 00:16:47,010
that's that impulse to the cortex and
 

785
00:16:47,010 --> 00:16:50,700
that's that impulse to the cortex and
Tails the cortex to go satisfy that then

786
00:16:50,700 --> 00:16:50,710
Tails the cortex to go satisfy that then
 

787
00:16:50,710 --> 00:16:53,850
Tails the cortex to go satisfy that then
a great deal of like a massive amount of

788
00:16:53,850 --> 00:16:53,860
a great deal of like a massive amount of
 

789
00:16:53,860 --> 00:16:56,040
a great deal of like a massive amount of
thinking like truly this stupendous

790
00:16:56,040 --> 00:16:56,050
thinking like truly this stupendous
 

791
00:16:56,050 --> 00:16:58,130
thinking like truly this stupendous
amount of thinking has gone into sex

792
00:16:58,130 --> 00:16:58,140
amount of thinking has gone into sex
 

793
00:16:58,140 --> 00:17:00,780

00:17:00,790 --> 00:17:05,880
without purpose without provocation
without procreation which which is

00:17:05,880 --> 00:17:05,890
without procreation which which is
 

797
00:17:05,890 --> 00:17:09,030
without procreation which which is
actually quite a silly action in the

798
00:17:09,030 --> 00:17:09,040
actually quite a silly action in the
 

799
00:17:09,040 --> 00:17:12,290
actually quite a silly action in the
absence of procreation it's a bit silly

800
00:17:12,290 --> 00:17:12,300
absence of procreation it's a bit silly
 

801
00:17:12,300 --> 00:17:14,640
absence of procreation it's a bit silly
the one why you doing it that's because

802
00:17:14,640 --> 00:17:14,650
the one why you doing it that's because
 

803
00:17:14,650 --> 00:17:16,079
the one why you doing it that's because
it makes the limbic system happy that's

804
00:17:16,079 --> 00:17:16,089
it makes the limbic system happy that's
 

805
00:17:16,089 --> 00:17:19,260
it makes the limbic system happy that's
why that's why but it's pretty absurd

806
00:17:19,260 --> 00:17:19,270
why that's why but it's pretty absurd
 

807
00:17:19,270 --> 00:17:23,040
why that's why but it's pretty absurd
really well the whole of existence is

808
00:17:23,040 --> 00:17:23,050
really well the whole of existence is
 

809
00:17:23,050 --> 00:17:25,110
really well the whole of existence is
pretty absurd in some kind of sense yeah

810
00:17:25,110 --> 00:17:25,120
pretty absurd in some kind of sense yeah
 

811
00:17:25,120 --> 00:17:26,910
pretty absurd in some kind of sense yeah
but I mean this does a lot of

812
00:17:26,910 --> 00:17:26,920
but I mean this does a lot of
 

813
00:17:26,920 --> 00:17:29,670
but I mean this does a lot of
computation has gone into how can I do

814
00:17:29,670 --> 00:17:29,680
computation has gone into how can I do
 

815
00:17:29,680 --> 00:17:31,190
computation has gone into how can I do
more of that

816
00:17:31,190 --> 00:17:31,200
more of that
 

817
00:17:31,200 --> 00:17:33,300
more of that
with the co-creation not even being a

818
00:17:33,300 --> 00:17:33,310
with the co-creation not even being a
 

819
00:17:33,310 --> 00:17:36,180
with the co-creation not even being a
factor this is I think a very important

820
00:17:36,180 --> 00:17:36,190
factor this is I think a very important
 

821
00:17:36,190 --> 00:17:40,980
factor this is I think a very important

area of research for NSFW an agency that
 

823
00:17:40,990 --> 00:17:42,420
area of research for NSFW an agency that
should receive a lot of funding

824
00:17:42,420 --> 00:17:42,430
should receive a lot of funding
 

825
00:17:42,430 --> 00:17:44,400
should receive a lot of funding
especially after this decision if I

especially after this decision if I
 

827
00:17:44,410 --> 00:17:47,450
especially after this decision if I

00:17:53,730 --> 00:17:53,740
what is the most exciting or some of the
 

833
00:17:53,740 --> 00:17:56,070
what is the most exciting or some of the
most exciting things that you see in the

most exciting things that you see in the
 

835
00:17:56,080 --> 00:17:59,190
most exciting things that you see in the
future impact of neural link both on the

839
00:18:02,040 --> 00:18:04,890
size engineering a societal broad impact
so in your link I think that first will

840
00:18:04,890 --> 00:18:04,900
so in your link I think that first will
 

841
00:18:04,900 --> 00:18:08,240
so in your link I think that first will
solve a lot of brain related diseases so

842
00:18:08,240 --> 00:18:08,250
solve a lot of brain related diseases so
 

843
00:18:08,250 --> 00:18:10,670
solve a lot of brain related diseases so
creating from like autism schizophrenia

844
00:18:10,670 --> 00:18:10,680
creating from like autism schizophrenia
 

845
00:18:10,680 --> 00:18:13,230

847
00:18:13,240 --> 00:18:15,510
memory loss like everyone experiences
memory loss that at certain point in in

848
00:18:15,510 --> 00:18:15,520

851
00:18:17,530 --> 00:18:20,010
age parents can't remember their kids
names and that kind of thing so there's

852
00:18:20,010 --> 00:18:20,020
names and that kind of thing so there's
 

853
00:18:20,020 --> 00:18:22,380
names and that kind of thing so there's
like mount of good that neural link can

00:18:22,380 --> 00:18:22,390
like mount of good that neural link can
 

855
00:18:22,390 --> 00:18:28,140
like mount of good that neural link can
do in solving a critical critical damage

856
00:18:28,140 --> 00:18:28,150
do in solving a critical critical damage
 

857
00:18:28,150 --> 00:18:30,900
do in solving a critical critical damage
to brain or the spinal cord there's a

858
00:18:30,900 --> 00:18:30,910
to brain or the spinal cord there's a
 

859
00:18:30,910 --> 00:18:33,150
to brain or the spinal cord there's a
lot that can be done to improve quality

860
00:18:33,150 --> 00:18:33,160
lot that can be done to improve quality
 

861
00:18:33,160 --> 00:18:35,910
lot that can be done to improve quality
of life of individuals and that will be

862
00:18:35,910 --> 00:18:35,920
of life of individuals and that will be
 

863
00:18:35,920 --> 00:18:37,830
of life of individuals and that will be
those three steps along the way and then

864
00:18:37,830 --> 00:18:37,840
those three steps along the way and then
 

865
00:18:37,840 --> 00:18:41,460
those three steps along the way and then
ultimately it's intended to address the

00:18:41,460 --> 00:18:41,470
ultimately it's intended to address the
 

867
00:18:41,470 --> 00:18:43,560
ultimately it's intended to address the

improving AI systems I think the chances

888
00:19:13,620 --> 00:19:13,630
improving AI systems I think the chances
 

889
00:19:13,630 --> 00:19:17,280
improving AI systems I think the chances
above zero percent it's nonzero yeah

890
00:19:17,280 --> 00:19:17,290
above zero percent it's nonzero yeah
 

891
00:19:17,290 --> 00:19:19,830
above zero percent it's nonzero yeah
there's a chance and that's so what I've

892
00:19:19,830 --> 00:19:19,840
there's a chance and that's so what I've
 

893
00:19:19,840 --> 00:19:23,160
there's a chance and that's so what I've
seen dumb and dumber yes so I'm saying

894
00:19:23,160 --> 00:19:23,170
seen dumb and dumber yes so I'm saying
 

895
00:19:23,170 --> 00:19:25,290
seen dumb and dumber yes so I'm saying
there's a chance he's saying one in a

896
00:19:25,290 --> 00:19:25,300
there's a chance he's saying one in a
 

897
00:19:25,300 --> 00:19:26,970
there's a chance he's saying one in a
billion or one in a million whatever it

898
00:19:26,970 --> 00:19:26,980
billion or one in a million whatever it
 

899
00:19:26,980 --> 00:19:28,920
billion or one in a million whatever it
was the dumb and dumber you know it went

900
00:19:28,920 --> 00:19:28,930
was the dumb and dumber you know it went
 

901
00:19:28,930 --> 00:19:30,480
was the dumb and dumber you know it went
from maybe one a million to improving

902
00:19:30,480 --> 00:19:30,490
from maybe one a million to improving
 

903
00:19:30,490 --> 00:19:32,580
from maybe one a million to improving
maybe it'll be one in a thousand and

904
00:19:32,580 --> 00:19:32,590
maybe it'll be one in a thousand and
 

905
00:19:32,590 --> 00:19:34,830
maybe it'll be one in a thousand and
then 100 then one in ten depends on the

906
00:19:34,830 --> 00:19:34,840
then 100 then one in ten depends on the
 

907
00:19:34,840 --> 00:19:37,290
then 100 then one in ten depends on the
rate of improvement of neural link and

908
00:19:37,290 --> 00:19:37,300
rate of improvement of neural link and
 

909
00:19:37,300 --> 00:19:40,260
rate of improvement of neural link and
how fast we're able to do make progress

910
00:19:40,260 --> 00:19:40,270
how fast we're able to do make progress
 

911
00:19:40,270 --> 00:19:42,300
how fast we're able to do make progress
you know well I've talked to a few folks

912
00:19:42,300 --> 00:19:42,310
you know well I've talked to a few folks
 

913
00:19:42,310 --> 00:19:44,580
you know well I've talked to a few folks
here quite brilliant engineers some I'm

914
00:19:44,580 --> 00:19:44,590
here quite brilliant engineers some I'm
 

915
00:19:44,590 --> 00:19:46,380
here quite brilliant engineers some I'm
excited yeah I think it's like

916
00:19:46,380 --> 00:19:46,390
excited yeah I think it's like
 

917
00:19:46,390 --> 00:19:48,480
excited yeah I think it's like
fundamentally good you know who you know

after they've had a spinal cord injury
 

923
00:19:53,100 --> 00:19:55,350
after they've had a spinal cord injury
you know restoring brain functionality

924
00:19:55,350 --> 00:19:55,360
you know restoring brain functionality

00:19:55,360 --> 00:19:59,040
you know restoring brain functionality
after a stroke solving debilitating

genetically orange brain diseases these

928
00:20:01,500 --> 00:20:01,510
genetically orange brain diseases these
 

929
00:20:01,510 --> 00:20:04,680
genetically orange brain diseases these
are all incredibly great I think and in

930
00:20:04,680 --> 00:20:04,690
are all incredibly great I think and in
 

931
00:20:04,690 --> 00:20:06,060
are all incredibly great I think and in
order to do these you have to be able to

932
00:20:06,060 --> 00:20:06,070
order to do these you have to be able to
 

933
00:20:06,070 --> 00:20:08,430
order to do these you have to be able to
interface with the neurons at detail

934
00:20:08,430 --> 00:20:08,440
interface with the neurons at detail
 

935
00:20:08,440 --> 00:20:10,770
interface with the neurons at detail
level and each build fire they're not

936
00:20:10,770 --> 00:20:10,780
level and each build fire they're not
 

937
00:20:10,780 --> 00:20:12,420
level and each build fire they're not
write neurons read the write neurons and

938
00:20:12,420 --> 00:20:12,430
write neurons read the write neurons and
 

939
00:20:12,430 --> 00:20:16,100
write neurons read the write neurons and
and then effectively you can create a

940
00:20:16,100 --> 00:20:16,110
and then effectively you can create a
 

941
00:20:16,110 --> 00:20:20,580
and then effectively you can create a
circuit replace what's broken with with

942
00:20:20,580 --> 00:20:20,590
circuit replace what's broken with with
 

943
00:20:20,590 --> 00:20:23,010
circuit replace what's broken with with
silicon and actually fill in them the

944
00:20:23,010 --> 00:20:23,020
silicon and actually fill in them the
 

945
00:20:23,020 --> 00:20:28,500
silicon and actually fill in them the
missing functionality and then over time

946
00:20:28,500 --> 00:20:28,510
missing functionality and then over time
 

947
00:20:28,510 --> 00:20:30,210

we can have with develop a tertiary

948
00:20:30,210 --> 00:20:30,220
we can have with develop a tertiary
 

949
00:20:30,220 --> 00:20:32,700
we can have with develop a tertiary
layer so if like limbic system is a

950
00:20:32,700 --> 00:20:32,710
layer so if like limbic system is a
 

951
00:20:32,710 --> 00:20:34,590
layer so if like limbic system is a
primary layer then the cortex is like a

952
00:20:34,590 --> 00:20:34,600
primary layer then the cortex is like a
 

953
00:20:34,600 --> 00:20:37,080
primary layer then the cortex is like a
sector the second layer now and I said

954
00:20:37,080 --> 00:20:37,090
sector the second layer now and I said
 

955
00:20:37,090 --> 00:20:38,730
sector the second layer now and I said
that you know the cortex is vastly more

956
00:20:38,730 --> 00:20:38,740
that you know the cortex is vastly more
 

957
00:20:38,740 --> 00:20:40,710
that you know the cortex is vastly more
intelligent than the limbic system but

958
00:20:40,710 --> 00:20:40,720
intelligent than the limbic system but
 

959
00:20:40,720 --> 00:20:42,120
intelligent than the limbic system but
people generally like the fact that they

960
00:20:42,120 --> 00:20:42,130
people generally like the fact that they
 

961
00:20:42,130 --> 00:20:44,010
people generally like the fact that they
have a living system and a cortex I've

962
00:20:44,010 --> 00:20:44,020
have a living system and a cortex I've
 

963
00:20:44,020 --> 00:20:45,540
have a living system and a cortex I've
met anyone who wants to lead either one

964
00:20:45,540 --> 00:20:45,550
met anyone who wants to lead either one
 

965
00:20:45,550 --> 00:20:47,970

of them there like a girl keeping both

966
00:20:47,970 --> 00:20:47,980
of them there like a girl keeping both
 

967
00:20:47,980 --> 00:20:49,860

that's cool the limbic system is kind of

968
00:20:49,860 --> 00:20:49,870
that's cool the limbic system is kind of
 

969
00:20:49,870 --> 00:20:50,220
that's cool the limbic system is kind of
fun

970
00:20:50,220 --> 00:20:50,230
fun
 

971
00:20:50,230 --> 00:20:53,220

tell us what the fun is absolutely and

972
00:20:53,220 --> 00:20:53,230
tell us what the fun is absolutely and

then you people generally don't lose the

974
00:20:56,040 --> 00:20:56,050
then you people generally don't lose the
 

975
00:20:56,050 --> 00:20:58,110
then you people generally don't lose the
cortex either all right they're like

976
00:20:58,110 --> 00:20:58,120

979
00:20:59,320 --> 00:21:02,010

yeah and and then there's a tertiary

980
00:21:02,010 --> 00:21:02,020
yeah and and then there's a tertiary
 

981
00:21:02,020 --> 00:21:03,450
yeah and and then there's a tertiary
layer which will be digital super

intelligence and I think there's room

984
00:21:07,110 --> 00:21:07,120

985
00:21:07,120 --> 00:21:10,610

for optimism given that the cortex the

986
00:21:10,610 --> 00:21:10,620
for optimism given that the cortex the
 

987
00:21:10,620 --> 00:21:12,750

well perhaps they can be a tertiary

992
00:21:16,620 --> 00:21:16,630
well perhaps they can be a tertiary
 

993
00:21:16,630 --> 00:21:19,860

lies and that that will be vastly more

996
00:21:21,750 --> 00:21:21,760
lies and that that will be vastly more
 

997
00:21:21,760 --> 00:21:23,880
lies and that that will be vastly more
intelligent than the cortex but still

998
00:21:23,880 --> 00:21:23,890
intelligent than the cortex but still
 

999
00:21:23,890 --> 00:21:26,820

00:23:51,080 --> 00:23:51,090
coating on the electrode that doesn't
 

1119
00:23:51,090 --> 00:23:55,310
coating on the electrode that doesn't
dissolve over time and and is safe in

1120
00:23:55,310 --> 00:23:55,320
dissolve over time and and is safe in
 

1121
00:23:55,320 --> 00:23:57,139
dissolve over time and and is safe in
the brain this is a very hard problem

1122
00:23:57,139 --> 00:23:57,149
the brain this is a very hard problem
 

1123
00:23:57,149 --> 00:24:02,060
the brain this is a very hard problem
and then and then how do you collect

1124
00:24:02,060 --> 00:24:02,070
and then and then how do you collect
 

1125
00:24:02,070 --> 00:24:05,509
and then and then how do you collect
those signals in a way that is most

1126
00:24:05,509 --> 00:24:05,519
those signals in a way that is most
 

1127
00:24:05,519 --> 00:24:07,190
those signals in a way that is most
efficient because you really just have

1128
00:24:07,190 --> 00:24:07,200
efficient because you really just have
 

1129
00:24:07,200 --> 00:24:09,139
efficient because you really just have
very tiny amounts of power to process

1130
00:24:09,139 --> 00:24:09,149
very tiny amounts of power to process
 

1131
00:24:09,149 --> 00:24:12,259
very tiny amounts of power to process
those signals you know and then we need

1132
00:24:12,259 --> 00:24:12,269
those signals you know and then we need
 

1133
00:24:12,269 --> 00:24:13,549
those signals you know and then we need
to automate the whole thing so it's like

1134
00:24:13,549 --> 00:24:13,559
to automate the whole thing so it's like
 

1135
00:24:13,559 --> 00:24:16,099
to automate the whole thing so it's like
LASIK you know so it's just it's it's

1136
00:24:16,099 --> 00:24:16,109
LASIK you know so it's just it's it's
 

1137
00:24:16,109 --> 00:24:19,399
LASIK you know so it's just it's it's
not if this is done by neurosurgeons

1138
00:24:19,399 --> 00:24:19,409
not if this is done by neurosurgeons
 

1139
00:24:19,409 --> 00:24:21,200
not if this is done by neurosurgeons
there's no way it can scale to large

1140
00:24:21,200 --> 00:24:21,210
there's no way it can scale to large
 

1141
00:24:21,210 --> 00:24:23,749
there's no way it can scale to large
numbers of people and it needs to scales

1142
00:24:23,749 --> 00:24:23,759
numbers of people and it needs to scales
 

1143
00:24:23,759 --> 00:24:24,889
numbers of people and it needs to scales
large numbers of people because I think

1144
00:24:24,889 --> 00:24:24,899
large numbers of people because I think
 

1145
00:24:24,899 --> 00:24:27,139
large numbers of people because I think
ultimately we want the future repeated

1146
00:24:27,139 --> 00:24:27,149
ultimately we want the future repeated
 

1147
00:24:27,149 --> 00:24:29,119
ultimately we want the future repeated
to be determined by a large number of

1148
00:24:29,119 --> 00:24:29,129
to be determined by a large number of
 

1149
00:24:29,129 --> 00:24:33,200
to be determined by a large number of
the of humans do you think that this has

1150
00:24:33,200 --> 00:24:33,210
the of humans do you think that this has
 

1151
00:24:33,210 --> 00:24:36,139
the of humans do you think that this has
a chance to revolutionize surgery period

1152
00:24:36,139 --> 00:24:36,149
a chance to revolutionize surgery period
 

1153
00:24:36,149 --> 00:24:39,710
a chance to revolutionize surgery period
so neurosurgery and Ellis yeah for sure

1154
00:24:39,710 --> 00:24:39,720
so neurosurgery and Ellis yeah for sure
 

1155
00:24:39,720 --> 00:24:41,869
so neurosurgery and Ellis yeah for sure
it's gotta be like lazy like you met if

1156
00:24:41,869 --> 00:24:41,879
it's gotta be like lazy like you met if
 

1157
00:24:41,879 --> 00:24:44,119
it's gotta be like lazy like you met if
LASIK had to be hand done not done by

1158
00:24:44,119 --> 00:24:44,129
LASIK had to be hand done not done by
 

1159
00:24:44,129 --> 00:24:46,539
LASIK had to be hand done not done by
hand by a person that wouldn't be great

1160
00:24:46,539 --> 00:24:46,549
hand by a person that wouldn't be great
 

1161
00:24:46,549 --> 00:24:52,669
hand by a person that wouldn't be great
you know it's done by a robot and

1162
00:24:52,669 --> 00:24:52,679
you know it's done by a robot and
 

1163
00:24:52,679 --> 00:24:53,810
you know it's done by a robot and
they'll off the mall it just kind of

1164
00:24:53,810 --> 00:24:53,820
they'll off the mall it just kind of
 

1165
00:24:53,820 --> 00:24:55,310
they'll off the mall it just kind of
just needs to make sure

1166
00:24:55,310 --> 00:24:55,320
just needs to make sure
 

1167
00:24:55,320 --> 00:24:57,590
just needs to make sure
yo-you heads in my position and then

1168
00:24:57,590 --> 00:24:57,600
yo-you heads in my position and then
 

1169
00:24:57,600 --> 00:25:00,140
yo-you heads in my position and then
they just press button and go it's a

1170
00:25:00,140 --> 00:25:00,150
they just press button and go it's a
 

1171
00:25:00,150 --> 00:25:03,020
they just press button and go it's a
smart summon and soon Auto Park takes on

1172
00:25:03,020 --> 00:25:03,030
smart summon and soon Auto Park takes on
 

1173
00:25:03,030 --> 00:25:05,390
smart summon and soon Auto Park takes on
the full beautiful mess of parking lots

1174
00:25:05,390 --> 00:25:05,400
the full beautiful mess of parking lots
 

1175
00:25:05,400 --> 00:25:06,980
the full beautiful mess of parking lots
and their human human nonverbal

1176
00:25:06,980 --> 00:25:06,990
and their human human nonverbal
 

1177
00:25:06,990 --> 00:25:10,430
and their human human nonverbal
communication I think it has actually

1178
00:25:10,430 --> 00:25:10,440
communication I think it has actually
 

1179
00:25:10,440 --> 00:25:13,640
communication I think it has actually
the potential to have a profound impact

1180
00:25:13,640 --> 00:25:13,650
the potential to have a profound impact
 

1181
00:25:13,650 --> 00:25:15,740
the potential to have a profound impact
in changing how our civilization looks

1182
00:25:15,740 --> 00:25:15,750
in changing how our civilization looks
 

1183
00:25:15,750 --> 00:25:18,710
in changing how our civilization looks
at AI in robotics because this is the

1184
00:25:18,710 --> 00:25:18,720
at AI in robotics because this is the
 

1185
00:25:18,720 --> 00:25:20,570
at AI in robotics because this is the
first time human beings people that

1186
00:25:20,570 --> 00:25:20,580
first time human beings people that
 

1187
00:25:20,580 --> 00:25:22,280
first time human beings people that
don't own and test them Eve never seen

1188
00:25:22,280 --> 00:25:22,290
don't own and test them Eve never seen
 

1189
00:25:22,290 --> 00:25:24,500
don't own and test them Eve never seen
it doesn't hurt about a Tesla get to

1190
00:25:24,500 --> 00:25:24,510
it doesn't hurt about a Tesla get to
 

1191
00:25:24,510 --> 00:25:26,150
it doesn't hurt about a Tesla get to
watch hundreds of thousands of cars

1192
00:25:26,150 --> 00:25:26,160
watch hundreds of thousands of cars
 

1193
00:25:26,160 --> 00:25:30,230
watch hundreds of thousands of cars
without a driver yeah do you see it this

1194
00:25:30,230 --> 00:25:30,240
without a driver yeah do you see it this
 

1195
00:25:30,240 --> 00:25:31,970
without a driver yeah do you see it this
way almost like an education tool for

00:25:31,970 --> 00:25:31,980
way almost like an education tool for
 

1197
00:25:31,980 --> 00:25:34,250
way almost like an education tool for
the world about AI do you feel the

1198
00:25:34,250 --> 00:25:34,260
the world about AI do you feel the
 

1199
00:25:34,260 --> 00:25:36,260
the world about AI do you feel the
burden of that the excitement of that or

burden of that the excitement of that or
 

1201
00:25:36,270 --> 00:25:38,540
burden of that the excitement of that or
do you just think it's a smart parking

important which is most people have
 

1209
00:25:43,590 --> 00:25:46,340
important which is most people have
never really seen a robot or at and what

never really seen a robot or at and what
 

1211
00:25:46,350 --> 00:25:48,410
never really seen a robot or at and what
what is the card that is autonomous it's

what is the card that is autonomous it's
 

1213
00:25:48,420 --> 00:25:50,750
what is the card that is autonomous it's
a four wheeled robot yeah the it

1214
00:25:50,750 --> 00:25:50,760
a four wheeled robot yeah the it
 

1215
00:25:50,760 --> 00:25:52,640
a four wheeled robot yeah the it
communicates a certain sort of message

fuels lives easier with autonomy but now
 

1233
00:26:12,120 --> 00:26:14,140
fuels lives easier with autonomy but now
you mention it I think it will be an

00:26:14,140 --> 00:26:14,150
you mention it I think it will be an
 

1235
00:26:14,150 --> 00:26:16,190
you mention it I think it will be an
eye-opener to people about robotics

1236
00:26:16,190 --> 00:26:16,200
eye-opener to people about robotics
 

1237
00:26:16,200 --> 00:26:18,860
eye-opener to people about robotics
because they have really never seen most

1238

because they have really never seen most
 

1239
00:26:18,870 --> 00:26:21,640
because they have really never seen most
people never seen a robot and are

hundreds of thousands of Tesla's won't
 

1243
00:26:23,910 --> 00:26:24,980
hundreds of thousands of Tesla's won't
be long before there's a million of them

1244
00:26:24,980 --> 00:26:24,990
be long before there's a million of them
 

1245
00:26:24,990 --> 00:26:28,040
be long before there's a million of them
that have autonomous capability and the

1246
00:26:28,040 --> 00:26:28,050
that have autonomous capability and the
 

1247
00:26:28,050 --> 00:26:30,200
that have autonomous capability and the
drive without a person in it and you use

1248
00:26:30,200 --> 00:26:30,210
drive without a person in it and you use
 

1249
00:26:30,210 --> 00:26:32,660
drive without a person in it and you use
you can see the kind of evolution of the

1250
00:26:32,660 --> 00:26:32,670
you can see the kind of evolution of the
 

1251
00:26:32,670 --> 00:26:36,020
you can see the kind of evolution of the
cars personality and and thinking with

1252
00:26:36,020 --> 00:26:36,030
cars personality and and thinking with
 

1253
00:26:36,030 --> 00:26:40,580
cars personality and and thinking with
each iteration of autopilot you can see

1254
00:26:40,580 --> 00:26:40,590
each iteration of autopilot you can see
 

1255
00:26:40,590 --> 00:26:43,400
each iteration of autopilot you can see
it's it's uncertain about this or it

1256
00:26:43,400 --> 00:26:43,410
it's it's uncertain about this or it
 

1257
00:26:43,410 --> 00:26:47,330
it's it's uncertain about this or it
gets it but now it's more certain now

1258
00:26:47,330 --> 00:26:47,340
gets it but now it's more certain now
 

1259
00:26:47,340 --> 00:26:48,590
gets it but now it's more certain now
now it's moving in a slightly different

1260
00:26:48,590 --> 00:26:48,600
now it's moving in a slightly different
 

1261
00:26:48,600 --> 00:26:51,440
now it's moving in a slightly different
way like I can tell immediately if a car

1262
00:26:51,440 --> 00:26:51,450
way like I can tell immediately if a car
 

1263
00:26:51,450 --> 00:26:53,810
way like I can tell immediately if a car
is on tells autopilot because got just

1264
00:26:53,810 --> 00:26:53,820
is on tells autopilot because got just
 

1265
00:26:53,820 --> 00:26:56,060
is on tells autopilot because got just
little nuances of movement it just moves

1266
00:26:56,060 --> 00:26:56,070
little nuances of movement it just moves
 

1267
00:26:56,070 --> 00:26:58,850
little nuances of movement it just moves
in a slightly different way it will

1268
00:26:58,850 --> 00:26:58,860
in a slightly different way it will
 

1269
00:26:58,860 --> 00:27:00,590
in a slightly different way it will
cause aunt Ella for example on the

1270
00:27:00,590 --> 00:27:00,600
cause aunt Ella for example on the
 

1271
00:27:00,600 --> 00:27:02,990
cause aunt Ella for example on the
highway are far more precise about being

and now civilization is all it's
 

1513
00:31:53,700 --> 00:31:58,100
and now civilization is all it's
globalized and so we're civilization I

globalized and so we're civilization I
 

1515
00:31:58,110 --> 00:32:00,019
globalized and so we're civilization I
think now rises and falls together
