and he saw their ways
 

299
00:05:08,000 --> 00:05:10,950
and he saw their ways
he used that russian science and then he

300

he used that russian science and then he
 

301
00:05:10,960 --> 00:05:12,550
he used that russian science and then he
was already an american

302
00:05:12,550 --> 00:05:12,560
was already an american
 

303
00:05:12,560 --> 00:05:15,830

what is a common thread between them

328
00:05:42,629 --> 00:05:42,639
what is a common thread between them
 

329
00:05:42,639 --> 00:05:45,029
what is a common thread between them
and what are maybe some of the

330
00:05:45,029 --> 00:05:45,039
and what are maybe some of the
 

331
00:05:45,039 --> 00:05:47,350
and what are maybe some of the
fundamental differences

332
00:05:47,350 --> 00:05:47,360
fundamental differences
 

333
00:05:47,360 --> 00:05:53,510
fundamental differences

i mean they weren't very coordinated

508
00:08:52,630 --> 00:08:52,640
i mean they weren't very coordinated
 

509
00:08:52,640 --> 00:08:55,190
i mean they weren't very coordinated
yeah but they work so hard to develop

510
00:08:55,190 --> 00:08:55,200
yeah but they work so hard to develop
 

511
00:08:55,200 --> 00:08:56,790
yeah but they work so hard to develop
themselves

512
00:08:56,790 --> 00:08:56,800
themselves
 

513
00:08:56,800 --> 00:08:58,310
themselves
what was your role in that process i

514
00:08:58,310 --> 00:08:58,320
what was your role in that process i
 

515
00:08:58,320 --> 00:09:00,710

517
00:09:00,720 --> 00:09:03,110
mean that means pushing kids to their
limit if if you're not going but you

518
00:09:03,110 --> 00:09:03,120
limit if if you're not going but you
 

519
00:09:03,120 --> 00:09:04,470
limit if if you're not going but you
can't push kids to their limit

520
00:09:04,470 --> 00:09:04,480
can't push kids to their limit
 

521

00:09:05,760 --> 00:09:07,590
and even when you push them to their
limit that's not their limit

524
00:09:07,590 --> 00:09:07,600
limit that's not their limit
 

525
00:09:07,600 --> 00:09:09,030
limit that's not their limit
because their limits above and beyond

526
00:09:09,030 --> 00:09:09,040
because their limits above and beyond
 

527
00:09:09,040 --> 00:09:11,269
because their limits above and beyond

that mistake before it gets too far
 

553
00:09:33,360 --> 00:09:35,590
that mistake before it gets too far
then it's going to be a casualty and i

554
00:09:35,590 --> 00:09:35,600
then it's going to be a casualty and i
 

555

that record performance is going to
 

925
00:16:01,920 --> 00:16:03,269
that record performance is going to
change yeah

through your mind your thoughts of that
day

1184
00:20:28,870 --> 00:20:28,880
day
 

1185
00:20:28,880 --> 00:20:32,470
day
yeah first of all uh it was quite a day

1186
00:20:32,470 --> 00:20:32,480
yeah first of all uh it was quite a day
 

1187
00:20:32,480 --> 00:20:35,750
yeah first of all uh it was quite a day
because uh we weighed in every day

1188
00:20:35,750 --> 00:20:35,760
because uh we weighed in every day
 

1189
00:20:35,760 --> 00:20:37,430
because uh we weighed in every day
at that time in the morning and that and

1190
00:20:37,430 --> 00:20:37,440
at that time in the morning and that and
 

1191
00:20:37,440 --> 00:20:39,190
at that time in the morning and that and
that yeah we weighed in two hours before

1192
00:20:39,190 --> 00:20:39,200
that yeah we weighed in two hours before
 

1193
00:20:39,200 --> 00:20:40,950
that yeah we weighed in two hours before
the start of the competition

1194
00:20:40,950 --> 00:20:40,960
the start of the competition
 

1195
00:20:40,960 --> 00:20:42,870
the start of the competition
and so that didn't mean that you weighed

1196
00:20:42,870 --> 00:20:42,880
and so that didn't mean that you weighed
 

1197
00:20:42,880 --> 00:20:43,990

scored on me in a certain way
 

1321

scored on me in a certain way
i would go over that situation over that

1322
00:22:54,789 --> 00:22:54,799
i would go over that situation over that
 

1323
00:22:54,799 --> 00:22:56,710
i would go over that situation over that
situation over it again

1324
00:22:56,710 --> 00:22:56,720
situation over it again
 

1325
00:22:56,720 --> 00:22:58,710
situation over it again
and i would come up with an answer and

1326
00:22:58,710 --> 00:22:58,720
and i would come up with an answer and
 

1327
00:22:58,720 --> 00:23:01,430
and i would come up with an answer and
then i would actually test it

1328
00:23:01,430 --> 00:23:01,440
then i would actually test it
 

1329
00:23:01,440 --> 00:23:02,630
then i would actually test it
maybe i wouldn't go right back the next

1330
00:23:02,630 --> 00:23:02,640
maybe i wouldn't go right back the next
 

1331
00:23:02,640 --> 00:23:04,950
maybe i wouldn't go right back the next
day because i didn't want the guy to

1332
00:23:04,950 --> 00:23:04,960
day because i didn't want the guy to

00:25:30,240 --> 00:25:31,190
really they picked the soviets picked to
beat you

1466
00:25:31,190 --> 00:25:31,200
beat you
 

1467
00:25:31,200 --> 00:25:33,110
beat you
right and i know why they picked him

1468
00:25:33,110 --> 00:25:33,120
right and i know why they picked him
 

1469
00:25:33,120 --> 00:25:34,630
right and i know why they picked him
because he had a great attitude

1470
00:25:34,630 --> 00:25:34,640
because he had a great attitude
 

1471
00:25:34,640 --> 00:25:38,470
because he had a great attitude
so he wasn't just the typical artist

1472
00:25:38,470 --> 00:25:38,480
so he wasn't just the typical artist
 

1473
00:25:38,480 --> 00:25:41,190
so he wasn't just the typical artist
he was a good artist he he hooked elbows

00:25:41,190 --> 00:25:41,200
he was a good artist he he hooked elbows
 

1475
00:25:41,200 --> 00:25:41,510
he was a good artist he he hooked elbows
like

1476
00:25:41,510 --> 00:25:41,520
like
 

1477
00:25:41,520 --> 00:25:44,310
like
sad gelav and he's from that area of the

1478
00:25:44,310 --> 00:25:44,320
sad gelav and he's from that area of the
 

1479
00:25:44,320 --> 00:25:44,870
sad gelav and he's from that area of the
world

1480
00:25:44,870 --> 00:25:44,880
world
 

1481
00:25:44,880 --> 00:25:46,789
world
where they have some of those types of

1482
00:25:46,789 --> 00:25:46,799
where they have some of those types of
 

1483
00:25:46,799 --> 00:25:49,909
where they have some of those types of
moves but he was and he was a goer

1484
00:25:49,909 --> 00:25:49,919
moves but he was and he was a goer
 

1485
00:25:49,919 --> 00:25:52,549
moves but he was and he was a goer
but by cutting him down a weight he lost

1486
00:25:52,549 --> 00:25:52,559
but by cutting him down a weight he lost
 

1487
00:25:52,559 --> 00:25:54,710
but by cutting him down a weight he lost
some of that go

1488
00:25:54,710 --> 00:25:54,720
some of that go
 

1489
00:25:54,720 --> 00:25:56,950
some of that go
and i don't know if you you got to

1490
00:25:56,950 --> 00:25:56,960
and i don't know if you you got to
 

1491
00:25:56,960 --> 00:25:58,470
and i don't know if you you got to
that's a process you got to

1492
00:25:58,470 --> 00:25:58,480
that's a process you got to
 

1493
00:25:58,480 --> 00:26:01,669
that's a process you got to
go about scientifically yeah you know

1494
00:26:01,669 --> 00:26:01,679
go about scientifically yeah you know
 

1495
00:26:01,679 --> 00:26:03,909
go about scientifically yeah you know
and so you know if you don't do it as an

1496
00:26:03,909 --> 00:26:03,919
and so you know if you don't do it as an
 

1497
00:26:03,919 --> 00:26:04,710
and so you know if you don't do it as an
american

1498
00:26:04,710 --> 00:26:04,720
american
 

1499
00:26:04,720 --> 00:26:06,230
american
it can really hurt your performance if

1500
00:26:06,230 --> 00:26:06,240
it can really hurt your performance if
 

1501
00:26:06,240 --> 00:26:07,909
it can really hurt your performance if
you don't do it as a a russian

1502
00:26:07,909 --> 00:26:07,919
you don't do it as a a russian
 

1503
00:26:07,919 --> 00:26:09,350
you don't do it as a a russian
it can hurt your performance and they

1504
00:26:09,350 --> 00:26:09,360
it can hurt your performance and they
 

1505
00:26:09,360 --> 00:26:11,750
it can hurt your performance and they
already didn't really

1506
00:26:11,750 --> 00:26:11,760
already didn't really
 

1507
00:26:11,760 --> 00:26:14,390
already didn't really
do that a lot where you usually wrestle

1508
00:26:14,390 --> 00:26:14,400
do that a lot where you usually wrestle
 

1509
00:26:14,400 --> 00:26:16,070
do that a lot where you usually wrestle
the weight where it was more like your

1510
00:26:16,070 --> 00:26:16,080
the weight where it was more like your
 

1511
00:26:16,080 --> 00:26:17,029
the weight where it was more like your
weight

1512
00:26:17,029 --> 00:26:17,039
weight
 

1513
00:26:17,039 --> 00:26:19,510
weight
and so by cutting him down you know

1514
00:26:19,510 --> 00:26:19,520
and so by cutting him down you know
 

1515
00:26:19,520 --> 00:26:21,510
and so by cutting him down you know
maybe slowed his

1516
00:26:21,510 --> 00:26:21,520
maybe slowed his
 

1517
00:26:21,520 --> 00:26:23,510
maybe slowed his
belief down a little bit you saw it in

1518
00:26:23,510 --> 00:26:23,520
belief down a little bit you saw it in
 

1519
00:26:23,520 --> 00:26:24,789
belief down a little bit you saw it in
him the spirit was

1520
00:26:24,789 --> 00:26:24,799
him the spirit was
 

1521
00:26:24,799 --> 00:26:26,149
him the spirit was
a little bit gone when you were facing

1522
00:26:26,149 --> 00:26:26,159
a little bit gone when you were facing
 

1523
00:26:26,159 --> 00:26:28,070
a little bit gone when you were facing
yeah but then he came back and he won

1524
00:26:28,070 --> 00:26:28,080
yeah but then he came back and he won
 

1525
00:26:28,080 --> 00:26:30,070
yeah but then he came back and he won
you know rest of the matches and he was

1526
00:26:30,070 --> 00:26:30,080
you know rest of the matches and he was
 

1527
00:26:30,080 --> 00:26:32,310
you know rest of the matches and he was
in the round robin and he was able to go

1528
00:26:32,310 --> 00:26:32,320
in the round robin and he was able to go
 

1529
00:26:32,320 --> 00:26:33,909
in the round robin and he was able to go
to the finals

1530
00:26:33,909 --> 00:26:33,919
to the finals
 

1531
00:26:33,919 --> 00:26:36,149
to the finals
uh but he had lost another match

1532
00:26:36,149 --> 00:26:36,159
uh but he had lost another match
 

1533
00:26:36,159 --> 00:26:38,070
uh but he had lost another match
actually against in the round-robin

1534
00:26:38,070 --> 00:26:38,080
actually against in the round-robin
 

1535
00:26:38,080 --> 00:26:40,070
actually against in the round-robin
against the japanese so

1536
00:26:40,070 --> 00:26:40,080
against the japanese so
 

1537
00:26:40,080 --> 00:26:43,750
against the japanese so
i i think i had already gained

1538
00:26:43,750 --> 00:26:43,760
i i think i had already gained
 

1539
00:26:43,760 --> 00:26:46,149
i i think i had already gained
enough of artistic being able to finish

1540
00:26:46,149 --> 00:26:46,159
enough of artistic being able to finish
 

1541
00:26:46,159 --> 00:26:48,789
enough of artistic being able to finish
a match once i lost my match in college

1542
00:26:48,789 --> 00:26:48,799
a match once i lost my match in college
 

1543
00:26:48,799 --> 00:26:50,470
a match once i lost my match in college
for the last two years i took on some of

1544
00:26:50,470 --> 00:26:50,480
for the last two years i took on some of
 

1545
00:26:50,480 --> 00:26:52,149
for the last two years i took on some of
that artistic uh

1546
00:26:52,149 --> 00:26:52,159
that artistic uh
 

1547
00:26:52,159 --> 00:26:56,070
that artistic uh
work and i think that he was already

1548
00:26:56,070 --> 00:26:56,080
work and i think that he was already
 

1549
00:26:56,080 --> 00:26:58,789
work and i think that he was already
hoping to win but he was hoping to win

1550
00:26:58,789 --> 00:26:58,799
hoping to win but he was hoping to win
 

1551
00:26:58,799 --> 00:26:59,110
hoping to win but he was hoping to win
by

1552
00:26:59,110 --> 00:26:59,120
by
 

1553
00:26:59,120 --> 00:27:02,070
by
a long ways because he had to pin me or

1554
00:27:02,070 --> 00:27:02,080
a long ways because he had to pin me or
 

1555
00:27:02,080 --> 00:27:03,190
a long ways because he had to pin me or
beat me by

1556
00:27:03,190 --> 00:27:03,200
beat me by
 

1557
00:27:03,200 --> 00:27:06,149
beat me by
eight points to be able to win the gold

1558
00:27:06,149 --> 00:27:06,159
eight points to be able to win the gold
 

1559
00:27:06,159 --> 00:27:06,950
eight points to be able to win the gold
and

1560
00:27:06,950 --> 00:27:06,960
and
 

1561
00:27:06,960 --> 00:27:08,870
and
uh you know that wasn't going to happen

1562
00:27:08,870 --> 00:27:08,880
uh you know that wasn't going to happen
 

1563
00:27:08,880 --> 00:27:10,870
uh you know that wasn't going to happen
i mean the chances of pin is pretty good

1564
00:27:10,870 --> 00:27:10,880
i mean the chances of pin is pretty good
 

1565
00:27:10,880 --> 00:27:13,029
i mean the chances of pin is pretty good
is it hard to pin down gable versus take

1566
00:27:13,029 --> 00:27:13,039
is it hard to pin down gable versus take
 

1567
00:27:13,039 --> 00:27:13,990
is it hard to pin down gable versus take
down

1568
00:27:13,990 --> 00:27:14,000
down
 

1569
00:27:14,000 --> 00:27:15,990
down
like have you taken risks where you

1570
00:27:15,990 --> 00:27:16,000
like have you taken risks where you
 

1571
00:27:16,000 --> 00:27:17,669
like have you taken risks where you
could pay for them

1572
00:27:17,669 --> 00:27:17,679
could pay for them
 

1573
00:27:17,679 --> 00:27:20,710
could pay for them
i can't remember too many that i took

1574
00:27:20,710 --> 00:27:20,720
i can't remember too many that i took
 

1575
00:27:20,720 --> 00:27:22,310
i can't remember too many that i took
uh that would actually put me in a

1576
00:27:22,310 --> 00:27:22,320
uh that would actually put me in a
 

1577
00:27:22,320 --> 00:27:23,750
uh that would actually put me in a
danger position

1578
00:27:23,750 --> 00:27:23,760
danger position
 

1579
00:27:23,760 --> 00:27:26,310
danger position
i've taken risk but the risks were so

1580
00:27:26,310 --> 00:27:26,320
i've taken risk but the risks were so
 

1581
00:27:26,320 --> 00:27:28,789
i've taken risk but the risks were so
scientifically technically correct

1582
00:27:28,789 --> 00:27:28,799
scientifically technically correct
 

1583
00:27:28,799 --> 00:27:31,990
scientifically technically correct
that i wouldn't land in that danger

1584
00:27:31,990 --> 00:27:32,000
that i wouldn't land in that danger
 

1585
00:27:32,000 --> 00:27:34,070
that i wouldn't land in that danger
zone it's like if i'm going to lock up

1586
00:27:34,070 --> 00:27:34,080
zone it's like if i'm going to lock up
 

1587
00:27:34,080 --> 00:27:35,750
zone it's like if i'm going to lock up
and throw you i'm not going to throw you

1588
00:27:35,750 --> 00:27:35,760
and throw you i'm not going to throw you
 

1589
00:27:35,760 --> 00:27:36,950
and throw you i'm not going to throw you
to my own back

1590
00:27:36,950 --> 00:27:36,960
to my own back
 

1591
00:27:36,960 --> 00:27:38,789
to my own back
and roll you through i'm going to turn

1592
00:27:38,789 --> 00:27:38,799
and roll you through i'm going to turn
 

1593
00:27:38,799 --> 00:27:40,070
and roll you through i'm going to turn
in the air

1594
00:27:40,070 --> 00:27:40,080
in the air
 

1595
00:27:40,080 --> 00:27:41,669
in the air
so you're scientific about it yeah

1596
00:27:41,669 --> 00:27:41,679
so you're scientific about it yeah
 

1597
00:27:41,679 --> 00:27:44,630
so you're scientific about it yeah
exactly i you know he just

1598
00:27:44,630 --> 00:27:44,640
exactly i you know he just
 

1599
00:27:44,640 --> 00:27:47,110
exactly i you know he just
i learned the hard way early on there

1600
00:27:47,110 --> 00:27:47,120
i learned the hard way early on there
 

1601
00:27:47,120 --> 00:27:49,510
i learned the hard way early on there
was moves from collegiate wrestling

1602
00:27:49,510 --> 00:27:49,520
was moves from collegiate wrestling
 

1603
00:27:49,520 --> 00:27:51,830
was moves from collegiate wrestling
that you did that exposed your shoulders

1604
00:27:51,830 --> 00:27:51,840
that you did that exposed your shoulders
 

1605
00:27:51,840 --> 00:27:53,110
that you did that exposed your shoulders
which

1606
00:27:53,110 --> 00:27:53,120
which
 

1607
00:27:53,120 --> 00:27:54,950
which
it cost me in some early freestyle

1608
00:27:54,950 --> 00:27:54,960
it cost me in some early freestyle
 

1609
00:27:54,960 --> 00:27:57,430
it cost me in some early freestyle
matches against great wrestlers

1610
00:27:57,430 --> 00:27:57,440
matches against great wrestlers
 

1611
00:27:57,440 --> 00:28:01,510
matches against great wrestlers
but i would go back to my collegiate

1612
00:28:01,510 --> 00:28:01,520
but i would go back to my collegiate
 

1613
00:28:01,520 --> 00:28:03,909
but i would go back to my collegiate
escaping type moves to where i hit a

1614
00:28:03,909 --> 00:28:03,919
escaping type moves to where i hit a
 

1615
00:28:03,919 --> 00:28:05,750
escaping type moves to where i hit a
granby roll where you expose your

1616
00:28:05,750 --> 00:28:05,760
granby roll where you expose your
 

1617
00:28:05,760 --> 00:28:07,190
granby roll where you expose your
shoulders and you lose two points every

1618
00:28:07,190 --> 00:28:07,200
shoulders and you lose two points every
 

1619
00:28:07,200 --> 00:28:07,830
shoulders and you lose two points every
time

1620
00:28:07,830 --> 00:28:07,840
time
 

1621
00:28:07,840 --> 00:28:10,310
time
but you learn that that's not the system

1622
00:28:10,310 --> 00:28:10,320
but you learn that that's not the system
 

1623
00:28:10,320 --> 00:28:12,789
but you learn that that's not the system
but if you hadn't wrestled much

1624
00:28:12,789 --> 00:28:12,799

but obviously there was points and times
where i

1798
00:31:12,549 --> 00:31:12,559
where i

probably the fear of uh not being an

got to me more than anything else
i i said early on that i want to

1826
00:31:45,669 --> 00:31:45,679
i i said early on that i want to
 

1827
00:31:45,679 --> 00:31:46,630
i i said early on that i want to
eliminate

1828
00:31:46,630 --> 00:31:46,640
eliminate
 

1829
00:31:46,640 --> 00:31:48,389
eliminate
ever having to worry about getting tired

1830
00:31:48,389 --> 00:31:48,399
ever having to worry about getting tired
 

1831
00:31:48,399 --> 00:31:49,669
ever having to worry about getting tired
in a match

1832
00:31:49,669 --> 00:31:49,679
in a match
 

1833
00:31:49,679 --> 00:31:51,990
in a match
so i kind of eliminated that so i got

1834
00:31:51,990 --> 00:31:52,000
so i kind of eliminated that so i got
 

1835
00:31:52,000 --> 00:31:53,269
so i kind of eliminated that so i got
rid of that point

1836
00:31:53,269 --> 00:31:53,279
rid of that point
 

1837
00:31:53,279 --> 00:31:56,310
rid of that point
and i do think that in wrestling that is

1838
00:31:56,310 --> 00:31:56,320
and i do think that in wrestling that is
 

1839
00:31:56,320 --> 00:31:57,909
and i do think that in wrestling that is
one of the fears

1840
00:31:57,909 --> 00:31:57,919
one of the fears
 

1841
00:31:57,919 --> 00:32:00,950
one of the fears
that a lot of wrestlers have actually

1842
00:32:00,950 --> 00:32:00,960
that a lot of wrestlers have actually
 

1843
00:32:00,960 --> 00:32:03,590
that a lot of wrestlers have actually
how they feel during the match and and

1844
00:32:03,590 --> 00:32:03,600
how they feel during the match and and
 

1845
00:32:03,600 --> 00:32:05,269
how they feel during the match and and
do they get are they going to get tired

1846
00:32:05,269 --> 00:32:05,279
do they get are they going to get tired
 

1847
00:32:05,279 --> 00:32:05,830
do they get are they going to get tired
and

1848
00:32:05,830 --> 00:32:05,840
and
 

1849
00:32:05,840 --> 00:32:08,310
and
and is it going to affect my performance

1850
00:32:08,310 --> 00:32:08,320
and is it going to affect my performance
 

1851
00:32:08,320 --> 00:32:08,870
and is it going to affect my performance
and

1852
00:32:08,870 --> 00:32:08,880
and
 

1853
00:32:08,880 --> 00:32:10,870
and
as a coach that really was one of the

1854
00:32:10,870 --> 00:32:10,880
as a coach that really was one of the
 

1855
00:32:10,880 --> 00:32:12,630
as a coach that really was one of the
things i tried to eliminate on all my

1856
00:32:12,630 --> 00:32:12,640
things i tried to eliminate on all my
 

1857
00:32:12,640 --> 00:32:13,350
things i tried to eliminate on all my
athletes

athletes
so there wasn't that fear factor but

00:32:15,350 --> 00:32:15,360
so there wasn't that fear factor but
 

1861
00:32:15,360 --> 00:32:17,750
so there wasn't that fear factor but
that fear factor would be

1862
00:32:17,750 --> 00:32:17,760
that fear factor would be
 

1863
00:32:17,760 --> 00:32:21,350
that fear factor would be
put upon my opponent which would give me

1864
00:32:21,350 --> 00:32:21,360
put upon my opponent which would give me
 

1865
00:32:21,360 --> 00:32:24,789
put upon my opponent which would give me
an edge uh but that's not what i needed

you've been pushed to the limits
of exhaustion you know the question is

1916
00:33:07,750 --> 00:33:07,760
of exhaustion you know the question is
 

1917
00:33:07,760 --> 00:33:09,990
of exhaustion you know the question is
really a good question about

1918
00:33:09,990 --> 00:33:10,000
really a good question about
 

1919
00:33:10,000 --> 00:33:12,870
really a good question about
that pushing to you collapse yeah

1920
00:33:12,870 --> 00:33:12,880
that pushing to you collapse yeah
 

1921
00:33:12,880 --> 00:33:13,350
that pushing to you collapse yeah
because

1922
00:33:13,350 --> 00:33:13,360
because
 

1923
00:33:13,360 --> 00:33:15,029
because
i don't as a coach today i don't think i

1924
00:33:15,029 --> 00:33:15,039
i don't as a coach today i don't think i
 

1925
00:33:15,039 --> 00:33:18,630
i don't as a coach today i don't think i
could if i said that to my athletes

1926
00:33:18,630 --> 00:33:18,640
could if i said that to my athletes
 

1927
00:33:18,640 --> 00:33:22,149
could if i said that to my athletes
i don't know i could get in trouble

1928
00:33:22,149 --> 00:33:22,159
i don't know i could get in trouble
 

1929
00:33:22,159 --> 00:33:24,230
i don't know i could get in trouble
because you know it's understood isn't

1930
00:33:24,230 --> 00:33:24,240
because you know it's understood isn't
 

1931
00:33:24,240 --> 00:33:26,630
because you know it's understood isn't
it by the athletes

1932
00:33:26,630 --> 00:33:26,640
it by the athletes
 

1933
00:33:26,640 --> 00:33:29,750
it by the athletes
yeah they understand it but the outside

1934
00:33:29,750 --> 00:33:29,760
yeah they understand it but the outside
 

1935
00:33:29,760 --> 00:33:31,430
yeah they understand it but the outside
might not understand it

1936
00:33:31,430 --> 00:33:31,440
might not understand it
 

1937
00:33:31,440 --> 00:33:33,190
might not understand it
because it's almost like what do you

1938
00:33:33,190 --> 00:33:33,200
because it's almost like what do you
 

1939
00:33:33,200 --> 00:33:34,950
because it's almost like what do you
mean they're you push them to the point

1940
00:33:34,950 --> 00:33:34,960
mean they're you push them to the point
 

1941
00:33:34,960 --> 00:33:36,149
mean they're you push them to the point
where they go

1942
00:33:36,149 --> 00:33:36,159
where they go
 

1943
00:33:36,159 --> 00:33:37,990
where they go
collapse that means they may die or that

1944
00:33:37,990 --> 00:33:38,000
collapse that means they may die or that
 

1945
00:33:38,000 --> 00:33:39,990
collapse that means they may die or that
something might happen to them

1946
00:33:39,990 --> 00:33:40,000
something might happen to them
 

1947
00:33:40,000 --> 00:33:41,990
something might happen to them
and you know that's dangerous that's

1948
00:33:41,990 --> 00:33:42,000
and you know that's dangerous that's
 

1949
00:33:42,000 --> 00:33:44,149
and you know that's dangerous that's
dangerous we can't have our kid in that

1950
00:33:44,149 --> 00:33:44,159
dangerous we can't have our kid in that
 

1951
00:33:44,159 --> 00:33:46,950
dangerous we can't have our kid in that
type of atmosphere but it's something

1952
00:33:46,950 --> 00:33:46,960
type of atmosphere but it's something
 

1953
00:33:46,960 --> 00:33:47,430
type of atmosphere but it's something
that's

1954
00:33:47,430 --> 00:33:47,440
that's
 

1955
00:33:47,440 --> 00:33:49,029
that's
highly unlikely that's going to happen

1956
00:33:49,029 --> 00:33:49,039
highly unlikely that's going to happen
 

1957
00:33:49,039 --> 00:33:50,310
highly unlikely that's going to happen
but i'm going to tell you there's many

1958
00:33:50,310 --> 00:33:50,320
but i'm going to tell you there's many
 

1959
00:33:50,320 --> 00:33:50,710
but i'm going to tell you there's many
times

1960
00:33:50,710 --> 00:33:50,720
times

i need to get out of here it didn't
happen often but i can cut recount four

2002
00:34:35,750 --> 00:34:35,760
happen often but i can cut recount four
 

2003
00:34:35,760 --> 00:34:37,430
happen often but i can cut recount four
or five times in my career

2004
00:34:37,430 --> 00:34:37,440
or five times in my career
 

2005
00:34:37,440 --> 00:34:39,430
or five times in my career
that i pushed myself to that level where

2006
00:34:39,430 --> 00:34:39,440
that i pushed myself to that level where
 

2007
00:34:39,440 --> 00:34:41,190
that i pushed myself to that level where
i thought i was gonna maybe

2008
00:34:41,190 --> 00:34:41,200
i thought i was gonna maybe
 

2009
00:34:41,200 --> 00:34:44,629
i thought i was gonna maybe
go out but every step i was dizzy

2010
00:34:44,629 --> 00:34:44,639
go out but every step i was dizzy
 

2011
00:34:44,639 --> 00:34:47,349
go out but every step i was dizzy
but once i got to that door i was able

2012
00:34:47,349 --> 00:34:47,359
but once i got to that door i was able
 

2013
00:34:47,359 --> 00:34:47,669
but once i got to that door i was able
to

2014
00:34:47,669 --> 00:34:47,679
to
 

2015
00:34:47,679 --> 00:34:49,589
to
open it and go out yeah and grab the

2016
00:34:49,589 --> 00:34:49,599
open it and go out yeah and grab the
 

2017
00:34:49,599 --> 00:34:52,230
open it and go out yeah and grab the
water and get cold water in my face and

2018
00:34:52,230 --> 00:34:52,240
water and get cold water in my face and
 

2019
00:34:52,240 --> 00:34:55,109
water and get cold water in my face and
so no i never really was able to do that

2020
00:34:55,109 --> 00:34:55,119
so no i never really was able to do that
 

2021
00:34:55,119 --> 00:34:55,430
so no i never really was able to do that
and

2022
00:34:55,430 --> 00:34:55,440
and
 

2023
00:34:55,440 --> 00:34:58,069
and
i think the story is in a book where my

2024
00:34:58,069 --> 00:34:58,079
i think the story is in a book where my
 

2025
00:34:58,079 --> 00:34:58,790
i think the story is in a book where my
my daughter

2026
00:34:58,790 --> 00:34:58,800
my daughter
 

2027
00:34:58,800 --> 00:35:00,950
my daughter
pushed a collapse molly he made you

2028
00:35:00,950 --> 00:35:00,960
pushed a collapse molly he made you
 

2029
00:35:00,960 --> 00:35:03,430
pushed a collapse molly he made you
proud oh my gosh you know she didn't win

2030
00:35:03,430 --> 00:35:03,440
proud oh my gosh you know she didn't win
 

2031
00:35:03,440 --> 00:35:06,470
proud oh my gosh you know she didn't win
yeah but she pushed her collapse yeah

2032
00:35:06,470 --> 00:35:06,480
yeah but she pushed her collapse yeah
 

2033
00:35:06,480 --> 00:35:10,550
yeah but she pushed her collapse yeah
now did she suffer because of that

2034
00:35:10,550 --> 00:35:10,560
now did she suffer because of that
 

2035
00:35:10,560 --> 00:35:12,310
now did she suffer because of that
well she didn't get to go to the next

2036
00:35:12,310 --> 00:35:12,320
well she didn't get to go to the next
 

2037
00:35:12,320 --> 00:35:13,990
well she didn't get to go to the next
event because she didn't

2038
00:35:13,990 --> 00:35:14,000
event because she didn't
 

2039
00:35:14,000 --> 00:35:17,589
event because she didn't
she had to qualify but i think it

2040
00:35:17,589 --> 00:35:17,599
she had to qualify but i think it
 

2041
00:35:17,599 --> 00:35:19,270
she had to qualify but i think it
probably helped her too realizing

2042
00:35:19,270 --> 00:35:19,280
probably helped her too realizing
 

2043
00:35:19,280 --> 00:35:20,870
probably helped her too realizing
because she was wood in the race and she

2044
00:35:20,870 --> 00:35:20,880
because she was wood in the race and she
 

2045
00:35:20,880 --> 00:35:22,230
because she was wood in the race and she
was beating people she normally never

2046
00:35:22,230 --> 00:35:22,240
was beating people she normally never
 

2047
00:35:22,240 --> 00:35:23,030
was beating people she normally never
pushed

2048
00:35:23,030 --> 00:35:23,040
pushed
 

2049
00:35:23,040 --> 00:35:24,870
pushed
but she was at a new level that she had

2050
00:35:24,870 --> 00:35:24,880
but she was at a new level that she had
 

2051
00:35:24,880 --> 00:35:26,470
but she was at a new level that she had
never been before and she only needed

2052
00:35:26,470 --> 00:35:26,480
never been before and she only needed
 

2053
00:35:26,480 --> 00:35:27,109
never been before and she only needed
about

2054
00:35:27,109 --> 00:35:27,119
about
 

2055
00:35:27,119 --> 00:35:29,270
about
five feet to finish and it was just one

2056
00:35:29,270 --> 00:35:29,280
five feet to finish and it was just one
 

2057
00:35:29,280 --> 00:35:30,790
five feet to finish and it was just one
of those things that

2058
00:35:30,790 --> 00:35:30,800
of those things that
 

2059
00:35:30,800 --> 00:35:32,390
of those things that
i bet there was a lot of learning that

2060
00:35:32,390 --> 00:35:32,400
i bet there was a lot of learning that
 

2061
00:35:32,400 --> 00:35:34,790
i bet there was a lot of learning that
she did there and uh it probably

2062
00:35:34,790 --> 00:35:34,800
she did there and uh it probably
 

2063
00:35:34,800 --> 00:35:36,950
she did there and uh it probably
made her realize that she could be

2064
00:35:36,950 --> 00:35:36,960
made her realize that she could be
 

2065
00:35:36,960 --> 00:35:40,230
made her realize that she could be
better but she had to hold up though

2066
00:35:40,230 --> 00:35:40,240
better but she had to hold up though
 

2067
00:35:40,240 --> 00:35:42,630
better but she had to hold up though
so you mentioned in wrestling life that

2068
00:35:42,630 --> 00:35:42,640
so you mentioned in wrestling life that
 

2069
00:35:42,640 --> 00:35:44,470
so you mentioned in wrestling life that
the brand's brothers

2070
00:35:44,470 --> 00:35:44,480
the brand's brothers
 

2071
00:35:44,480 --> 00:35:48,150
the brand's brothers
looked up to royce alger who was known

2072
00:35:48,150 --> 00:35:48,160
looked up to royce alger who was known
 

2073
00:35:48,160 --> 00:35:49,510
looked up to royce alger who was known
for pushing the limits of physical

2074
00:35:49,510 --> 00:35:49,520
for pushing the limits of physical
 

2075
00:35:49,520 --> 00:35:52,550
for pushing the limits of physical
wrestling but not getting too rough

2076
00:35:52,550 --> 00:35:52,560
wrestling but not getting too rough
 

2077
00:35:52,560 --> 00:35:54,470
wrestling but not getting too rough
so how do you find the line between

2078
00:35:54,470 --> 00:35:54,480
so how do you find the line between
 

2079
00:35:54,480 --> 00:35:56,470
so how do you find the line between
extreme physical wrestling

2080
00:35:56,470 --> 00:35:56,480
extreme physical wrestling
 

2081
00:35:56,480 --> 00:35:59,109
extreme physical wrestling
but at the same time not rough wrestling

2082
00:35:59,109 --> 00:35:59,119
but at the same time not rough wrestling
 

2083
00:35:59,119 --> 00:36:00,790
but at the same time not rough wrestling
or angry wrestling

2084
00:36:00,790 --> 00:36:00,800
or angry wrestling
 

2085
00:36:00,800 --> 00:36:03,270
or angry wrestling
so that line between aggression tough

2086
00:36:03,270 --> 00:36:03,280
so that line between aggression tough
 

2087
00:36:03,280 --> 00:36:04,390
so that line between aggression tough
wrestling and

2088
00:36:04,390 --> 00:36:04,400
wrestling and
 

2089
00:36:04,400 --> 00:36:09,750
wrestling and
anger well i think anger would cause

2090
00:36:09,750 --> 00:36:09,760

 

2091
00:36:09,760 --> 00:36:12,310

less successful wrestling i think anger

2092
00:36:12,310 --> 00:36:12,320
less successful wrestling i think anger
 

2093
00:36:12,320 --> 00:36:13,510
less successful wrestling i think anger
would cause you to

2094
00:36:13,510 --> 00:36:13,520
would cause you to
 

2095
00:36:13,520 --> 00:36:16,310
would cause you to
make mistakes and actually get out of

2096
00:36:16,310 --> 00:36:16,320
make mistakes and actually get out of
 

2097
00:36:16,320 --> 00:36:17,990
make mistakes and actually get out of
position

2098
00:36:17,990 --> 00:36:18,000
position
 

2099
00:36:18,000 --> 00:36:20,470
position
because i think anger is kind of a loss

2100
00:36:20,470 --> 00:36:20,480
because i think anger is kind of a loss
 

2101
00:36:20,480 --> 00:36:22,550
because i think anger is kind of a loss
of control

2102
00:36:22,550 --> 00:36:22,560
of control
 

2103
00:36:22,560 --> 00:36:26,069
of control
and there can be a

2104

00:38:43,990 --> 00:38:44,000
okay with it or not because he says
 

2233
00:38:44,000 --> 00:38:47,270

until i got out of the house two years

2678
00:46:47,829 --> 00:46:47,839
until i got out of the house two years
 

2679
00:46:47,839 --> 00:46:48,710
until i got out of the house two years
later

2680
00:46:48,710 --> 00:46:48,720

years until i moved on and went to

the three new guys that came through

2994
00:52:05,670 --> 00:52:05,680
the three new guys that came through
 

2995
00:52:05,680 --> 00:52:08,710
the three new guys that came through
were guys that hadn't won world gold in

2996
00:52:08,710 --> 00:52:08,720
were guys that hadn't won world gold in
 

2997
00:52:08,720 --> 00:52:10,150

fact two of them have never made a world
team before

00:52:11,190 --> 00:52:11,200
team before
 

3001
00:52:11,200 --> 00:52:12,790
team before
and so when we have three world

3002
00:52:12,790 --> 00:52:12,800
and so when we have three world
 

3003
00:52:12,800 --> 00:52:14,950
and so when we have three world
champions this year but we needed

3004
00:52:14,950 --> 00:52:14,960
champions this year but we needed
 

3005
00:52:14,960 --> 00:52:16,390

all five of them to come through to win

3006
00:52:16,390 --> 00:52:16,400
all five of them to come through to win
 

3007

feel that way unless you've actually

3382
00:59:18,630 --> 00:59:18,640
feel that way unless you've actually
 

3383
00:59:18,640 --> 00:59:21,670

00:59:28,230 --> 00:59:28,240
mean when you broke that
 

3393
00:59:28,240 --> 00:59:30,069
mean when you broke that
when they broke that roger banister

3394
00:59:30,069 --> 00:59:30,079
when they broke that roger banister
 

3395
00:59:30,079 --> 00:59:31,510
when they broke that roger banister
broke that four minute mile

3396
00:59:31,510 --> 00:59:31,520
broke that four minute mile
 

3397
00:59:31,520 --> 00:59:34,069
broke that four minute mile
i can't imagine him breaking it from his

3398
00:59:34,069 --> 00:59:34,079
i can't imagine him breaking it from his
 

3399
00:59:34,079 --> 00:59:35,349
i can't imagine him breaking it from his
best time being 4

3400
00:59:35,349 --> 00:59:35,359
best time being 4
 

3401
00:59:35,359 --> 00:59:38,309
best time being 4
30. you know it's one of these things

3402
00:59:38,309 --> 00:59:38,319
30. you know it's one of these things
 

3403
00:59:38,319 --> 00:59:39,349
30. you know it's one of these things
that

3404
00:59:39,349 --> 00:59:39,359
that
 

3405
00:59:39,359 --> 00:59:42,470
that
along the line there that he did

3406
00:59:42,470 --> 00:59:42,480
along the line there that he did
 

3407
00:59:42,480 --> 00:59:46,150
along the line there that he did
had some close calls or

3408
00:59:46,150 --> 00:59:46,160
had some close calls or
 

3409
00:59:46,160 --> 00:59:48,870
had some close calls or
he had some coaching that was given him

3410
00:59:48,870 --> 00:59:48,880
he had some coaching that was given him
 

3411
00:59:48,880 --> 00:59:50,069
he had some coaching that was given him
the opportunity to become a little

3412
00:59:50,069 --> 00:59:50,079
the opportunity to become a little
 

3413
00:59:50,079 --> 00:59:50,789
the opportunity to become a little
better

3414
00:59:50,789 --> 00:59:50,799
better
 

3415
00:59:50,799 --> 00:59:54,309
better
but i think because he was doing well

3416
00:59:54,309 --> 00:59:54,319
but i think because he was doing well
 

3417
00:59:54,319 --> 00:59:57,270
but i think because he was doing well
and being very successful that the

3418
00:59:57,270 --> 00:59:57,280
and being very successful that the
 

3419
00:59:57,280 --> 00:59:58,309
and being very successful that the
opportunity came

3420
00:59:58,309 --> 00:59:58,319
opportunity came
 

3421
00:59:58,319 --> 01:00:00,309
opportunity came
and so as for me it's like the same

3422
01:00:00,309 --> 01:00:00,319
and so as for me it's like the same
 

3423
01:00:00,319 --> 01:00:02,710
and so as for me it's like the same
thing i had so much

3424
01:00:02,710 --> 01:00:02,720
thing i had so much
 

3425
01:00:02,720 --> 01:00:05,829
thing i had so much
success and so many

3426
01:00:05,829 --> 01:00:05,839
success and so many
 

3427
01:00:05,839 --> 01:00:09,190
success and so many
practices that went well

3428
01:00:09,190 --> 01:00:09,200
practices that went well
 

3429
01:00:09,200 --> 01:00:13,990
practices that went well
and so much goodness out of this sport

3430
01:00:13,990 --> 01:00:14,000
and so much goodness out of this sport
 

3431
01:00:14,000 --> 01:00:17,510
and so much goodness out of this sport
that it gave me the opportunity

3432
01:00:17,510 --> 01:00:17,520
that it gave me the opportunity
 

3433
01:00:17,520 --> 01:00:21,349
that it gave me the opportunity
to really look more finite

3434
01:00:21,349 --> 01:00:21,359
to really look more finite
 

3435
01:00:21,359 --> 01:00:23,190
to really look more finite
and look more how i can even make it

3436
01:00:23,190 --> 01:00:23,200
and look more how i can even make it
 

3437
01:00:23,200 --> 01:00:25,109
and look more how i can even make it
better and so it's like

3438
01:00:25,109 --> 01:00:25,119
better and so it's like
 

3439
01:00:25,119 --> 01:00:27,829
better and so it's like
if you look at my library upstairs i got

3440
01:00:27,829 --> 01:00:27,839
if you look at my library upstairs i got
 

3441
01:00:27,839 --> 01:00:30,710
if you look at my library upstairs i got
a library upstairs

3442
01:00:30,710 --> 01:00:30,720
a library upstairs
 

3443
01:00:30,720 --> 01:00:34,150
a library upstairs
and there's a lot of books up there

3444
01:00:34,150 --> 01:00:34,160
and there's a lot of books up there
 

3445
01:00:34,160 --> 01:00:36,390
and there's a lot of books up there
from the family and but if you look at

3446
01:00:36,390 --> 01:00:36,400
from the family and but if you look at
 

3447
01:00:36,400 --> 01:00:39,109
from the family and but if you look at
the gable books up there

3448
01:00:39,109 --> 01:00:39,119
the gable books up there
 

3449
01:00:39,119 --> 01:00:44,150
the gable books up there
i got a lot of russian technique books

3450
01:00:44,150 --> 01:00:44,160

 

3451
01:00:44,160 --> 01:00:47,430

i can't read the book but i can see the

3452
01:00:47,430 --> 01:00:47,440
i can't read the book but i can see the
 

3453
01:00:47,440 --> 01:00:49,270
i can't read the book but i can see the
diagrams

3454
01:00:49,270 --> 01:00:49,280
diagrams
 

3455
01:00:49,280 --> 01:00:52,230
diagrams
and i can see this the figures they

3456
01:00:52,230 --> 01:00:52,240
and i can see this the figures they
 

3457
01:00:52,240 --> 01:00:54,069
and i can see this the figures they
don't really show it in pictures

3458
01:00:54,069 --> 01:00:54,079
don't really show it in pictures
 

3459
01:00:54,079 --> 01:00:57,829
don't really show it in pictures
they do it in drawings and

3460
01:00:57,829 --> 01:00:57,839
they do it in drawings and
 

3461
01:00:57,839 --> 01:00:59,910
they do it in drawings and
and so it's like when i was trying to

3462
01:00:59,910 --> 01:00:59,920
and so it's like when i was trying to
 

3463
01:00:59,920 --> 01:01:01,349
and so it's like when i was trying to
beat the best

3464
01:01:01,349 --> 01:01:01,359
beat the best
 

3465
01:01:01,359 --> 01:01:04,789
beat the best
that has labeled the best because

3466
01:01:04,789 --> 01:01:04,799
that has labeled the best because
 

3467
01:01:04,799 --> 01:01:06,390
that has labeled the best because
they win the world championships every

3468
01:01:06,390 --> 01:01:06,400
they win the world championships every
 

3469
01:01:06,400 --> 01:01:07,910
they win the world championships every
year since they've

3470
01:01:07,910 --> 01:01:07,920
year since they've
 

3471
01:01:07,920 --> 01:01:10,069
year since they've
been just about involved and i don't

3472
01:01:10,069 --> 01:01:10,079
been just about involved and i don't
 

3473
01:01:10,079 --> 01:01:11,430
been just about involved and i don't
think they got started involved until

3474
01:01:11,430 --> 01:01:11,440
think they got started involved until
 

3475
01:01:11,440 --> 01:01:13,190
think they got started involved until
like the 50s but

3476
01:01:13,190 --> 01:01:13,200
like the 50s but
 

3477
01:01:13,200 --> 01:01:16,549
like the 50s but
but you know it's something you know you

3478
01:01:16,549 --> 01:01:16,559
but you know it's something you know you
 

3479
01:01:16,559 --> 01:01:17,510
but you know it's something you know you
study

3480
01:01:17,510 --> 01:01:17,520
study
 

3481
01:01:17,520 --> 01:01:20,470
study
the best who's out there but then you

3482
01:01:20,470 --> 01:01:20,480
the best who's out there but then you
 

3483
01:01:20,480 --> 01:01:21,270
the best who's out there but then you
don't focus

3484
01:01:21,270 --> 01:01:21,280
don't focus
 

3485
01:01:21,280 --> 01:01:24,309
don't focus
so much on the best that you can't beat

3486
01:01:24,309 --> 01:01:24,319
so much on the best that you can't beat
 

3487
01:01:24,319 --> 01:01:25,589
so much on the best that you can't beat
the best

3488
01:01:25,589 --> 01:01:25,599
the best
 

3489
01:01:25,599 --> 01:01:27,910
the best
you learn from them but there's

3490
01:01:27,910 --> 01:01:27,920
you learn from them but there's
 

3491
01:01:27,920 --> 01:01:31,190
you learn from them but there's
something that they don't have

3492
01:01:31,190 --> 01:01:31,200
something that they don't have
 

3493
01:01:31,200 --> 01:01:34,230
something that they don't have
that you can have toughness to technique

3494
01:01:34,230 --> 01:01:34,240
that you can have toughness to technique
 

3495
01:01:34,240 --> 01:01:37,190
that you can have toughness to technique
to the art to the science yeah all that

3497
01:01:37,200 --> 01:01:38,309
to the art to the science yeah all that
stuff and that's why

3498
01:01:38,309 --> 01:01:38,319
stuff and that's why
 

3499
01:01:38,319 --> 01:01:39,829
stuff and that's why

sea
 

3591
01:03:09,200 --> 01:03:11,910
sea
and part of it and uh ernest hemingway

3592
01:03:11,910 --> 01:03:11,920
and part of it and uh ernest hemingway
 

3593
01:03:11,920 --> 01:03:13,589
and part of it and uh ernest hemingway
ernest hemingway yeah

3594
01:03:13,589 --> 01:03:13,599
ernest hemingway yeah
 

3595

it in doesn't have the strength so they

3602
01:03:20,789 --> 01:03:20,799
it in doesn't have the strength so they
 

3603
01:03:20,799 --> 01:03:22,230
it in doesn't have the strength so they
together spend

together spend
 

3605
01:03:22,240 --> 01:03:24,470
together spend
while the sharks eat away at it i mean

while the sharks eat away at it i mean
 

3607
01:03:24,480 --> 01:03:25,829
while the sharks eat away at it i mean
this is very powerful

3608
01:03:25,829 --> 01:03:25,839
this is very powerful
 

3609
01:03:25,839 --> 01:03:28,390
this is very powerful
story i think one in the nobel prize but

he says
 

3613
01:03:28,960 --> 01:03:31,589
he says
it's better to be lucky the old man says

3614
01:03:31,589 --> 01:03:31,599
it's better to be lucky the old man says
 

3615
01:03:31,599 --> 01:03:33,029
it's better to be lucky the old man says
it's better to be lucky

3616

it's better to be lucky
 

3617
01:03:33,039 --> 01:03:36,230
it's better to be lucky
but i would rather be exact that that

3618
01:03:36,230 --> 01:03:36,240
but i would rather be exact that that
 

3619
01:03:36,240 --> 01:03:38,710
but i would rather be exact that that
that way when luck comes you're ready so

3620
01:03:38,710 --> 01:03:38,720
that way when luck comes you're ready so
 

3621
01:03:38,720 --> 01:03:40,150
that way when luck comes you're ready so
let me ask

3622
01:03:40,150 --> 01:03:40,160
let me ask
 

3623
01:03:40,160 --> 01:03:43,190
let me ask
uh what do you think about luck

3624
01:03:43,190 --> 01:03:43,200
uh what do you think about luck
 

3625
01:03:43,200 --> 01:03:45,990
uh what do you think about luck
do you believe in free will that we have

3626
01:03:45,990 --> 01:03:46,000
do you believe in free will that we have
 

3627
01:03:46,000 --> 01:03:47,029
do you believe in free will that we have
actions

3628
01:03:47,029 --> 01:03:47,039
actions
 

3629
01:03:47,039 --> 01:03:48,870
actions
that control the direction destination

3630
01:03:48,870 --> 01:03:48,880
that control the direction destination
 

3631
01:03:48,880 --> 01:03:50,470
that control the direction destination
of our life or does

3632
01:03:50,470 --> 01:03:50,480
of our life or does
 

3633
01:03:50,480 --> 01:03:53,510
of our life or does
luck and some other outside forces

3634
01:03:53,510 --> 01:03:53,520
luck and some other outside forces
 

3635
01:03:53,520 --> 01:03:57,670
luck and some other outside forces
really land you where you end up

3636
01:03:57,670 --> 01:03:57,680
really land you where you end up
 

3637
01:03:57,680 --> 01:04:01,029
really land you where you end up
for me i'm not about luck but i do

3638
01:04:01,029 --> 01:04:01,039
for me i'm not about luck but i do
 

3639
01:04:01,039 --> 01:04:04,789
for me i'm not about luck but i do
think there is luck is involved

3640
01:04:04,789 --> 01:04:04,799
think there is luck is involved
 

3641
01:04:04,799 --> 01:04:07,829
think there is luck is involved
but i think it's mostly created uh

3642
01:04:07,829 --> 01:04:07,839
but i think it's mostly created uh
 

3643
01:04:07,839 --> 01:04:09,589
but i think it's mostly created uh
just how lucky you are through

3663
01:04:29,440 --> 01:04:30,710
i don't think it was involved with luck
you know i think it was more involved

3664
01:04:30,710 --> 01:04:30,720
you know i think it was more involved
 

3665
01:04:30,720 --> 01:04:31,990
you know i think it was more involved
with preparation

3666
01:04:31,990 --> 01:04:32,000
with preparation
 

3667
01:04:32,000 --> 01:04:34,870
with preparation
and you know and again science had you

3668
01:04:34,870 --> 01:04:34,880
and you know and again science had you
 

3669
01:04:34,880 --> 01:04:35,990
and you know and again science had you
been smarter

3670
01:04:35,990 --> 01:04:36,000
been smarter
 

3671
01:04:36,000 --> 01:04:38,549
been smarter
had you understood that you could do

3672
01:04:38,549 --> 01:04:38,559
had you understood that you could do
 

3673
01:04:38,559 --> 01:04:39,670
had you understood that you could do
some things

3677
01:04:42,640 --> 01:04:43,829
and be just as lucky that'd be great but
i'm only as smart

3678
01:04:43,829 --> 01:04:43,839
i'm only as smart
 

3679
01:04:43,839 --> 01:04:47,510
i'm only as smart
as today so when i was training

3680
01:04:47,510 --> 01:04:47,520
as today so when i was training
 

3681
01:04:47,520 --> 01:04:50,230
as today so when i was training
in my life and me even training people

to uh

3688
01:04:55,349 --> 01:04:55,359
to uh
 

3689
01:04:55,359 --> 01:04:58,789

3695
01:05:01,359 --> 01:05:03,510
and that's what you call that a lot of
science so for me i

3696
01:05:03,510 --> 01:05:03,520
science so for me i
 

3697
01:05:03,520 --> 01:05:05,750
science so for me i
i think that uh you know like right now

3698
01:05:05,750 --> 01:05:05,760
i think that uh you know like right now
 

3699
01:05:05,760 --> 01:05:06,950
i think that uh you know like right now
if i look back

3700
01:05:06,950 --> 01:05:06,960
if i look back
 

3701
01:05:06,960 --> 01:05:09,430
if i look back
i do a lot of things different just

3702
01:05:09,430 --> 01:05:09,440
i do a lot of things different just
 

3703
01:05:09,440 --> 01:05:10,549
i do a lot of things different just
because

3704
01:05:10,549 --> 01:05:10,559
because
 

3705
01:05:10,559 --> 01:05:13,829
because
things are proven differently like i'd

3706
01:05:13,829 --> 01:05:13,839
things are proven differently like i'd
 

3707
01:05:13,839 --> 01:05:16,150
things are proven differently like i'd
give people water during practice and i

3708
01:05:16,150 --> 01:05:16,160
give people water during practice and i
 

3709
01:05:16,160 --> 01:05:17,190
give people water during practice and i
did

3710
01:05:17,190 --> 01:05:17,200
did
 

3711
01:05:17,200 --> 01:05:18,789
did
and i would let them change their

3712
01:05:18,789 --> 01:05:18,799
and i would let them change their
 

3713
01:05:18,799 --> 01:05:20,470
and i would let them change their
running wrestling shoes into running

3714
01:05:20,470 --> 01:05:20,480
running wrestling shoes into running
 

3715
01:05:20,480 --> 01:05:23,270
running wrestling shoes into running
shoes to run sprints on the concrete

3716
01:05:23,270 --> 01:05:23,280
shoes to run sprints on the concrete
 

3717
01:05:23,280 --> 01:05:26,309
shoes to run sprints on the concrete
or i would actually maybe um maybe i had

3718
01:05:26,309 --> 01:05:26,319
or i would actually maybe um maybe i had
 

3719
01:05:26,319 --> 01:05:28,870
or i would actually maybe um maybe i had
a guy climb 12 ropes after practice

3720
01:05:28,870 --> 01:05:28,880
a guy climb 12 ropes after practice
 

3721
01:05:28,880 --> 01:05:30,789
a guy climb 12 ropes after practice
one after another and then maybe the

3722
01:05:30,789 --> 01:05:30,799
one after another and then maybe the
 

3723
01:05:30,799 --> 01:05:32,309
one after another and then maybe the
next day i'd do it again

3724
01:05:32,309 --> 01:05:32,319
next day i'd do it again
 

3725
01:05:32,319 --> 01:05:34,309
next day i'd do it again
ah you know i might not make him do it

3726
01:05:34,309 --> 01:05:34,319
ah you know i might not make him do it
 

3727
01:05:34,319 --> 01:05:35,750
ah you know i might not make him do it
the next day i might

3728
01:05:35,750 --> 01:05:35,760
the next day i might
 

3729
01:05:35,760 --> 01:05:39,109
the next day i might
let him recover a little bit more and

3730
01:05:39,109 --> 01:05:39,119
let him recover a little bit more and
 

3731
01:05:39,119 --> 01:05:42,150
let him recover a little bit more and
uh you got to learn keep adding to

3732
01:05:42,150 --> 01:05:42,160
uh you got to learn keep adding to
 

3733
01:05:42,160 --> 01:05:44,789
uh you got to learn keep adding to
your philosophy and your philosophy may

3734
01:05:44,789 --> 01:05:44,799
your philosophy and your philosophy may
 

3735
01:05:44,799 --> 01:05:46,309
your philosophy and your philosophy may
have been great at that time

3736
01:05:46,309 --> 01:05:46,319
have been great at that time
 

3737
01:05:46,319 --> 01:05:49,589
have been great at that time
but it's at that time and what is really

3738
01:05:49,589 --> 01:05:49,599
but it's at that time and what is really
 

3739
01:05:49,599 --> 01:05:49,990
but it's at that time and what is really
important

3740
01:05:49,990 --> 01:05:50,000
important
 

3741
01:05:50,000 --> 01:05:53,750
important
is where you at with this time today

3742
01:05:53,750 --> 01:05:53,760
is where you at with this time today
 

3743
01:05:53,760 --> 01:05:56,230
is where you at with this time today
and so there's better ways to do things

3744
01:05:56,230 --> 01:05:56,240
and so there's better ways to do things
 

3745
01:05:56,240 --> 01:05:58,870
and so there's better ways to do things
now if you ever take attitude out of it

3746
01:05:58,870 --> 01:05:58,880
now if you ever take attitude out of it
 

3747
01:05:58,880 --> 01:06:03,190
now if you ever take attitude out of it
and just depend on total science

3748
01:06:03,190 --> 01:06:03,200
and just depend on total science
 

3749
01:06:03,200 --> 01:06:04,870
and just depend on total science
then you know you're not going to be as

so you know i think some of these

3822
01:07:27,510 --> 01:07:27,520
so you know i think some of these
 

3823
01:07:27,520 --> 01:07:30,710
so you know i think some of these
mma stars and some of these guys

3824
01:07:30,710 --> 01:07:30,720
mma stars and some of these guys
 

3825
01:07:30,720 --> 01:07:33,270
mma stars and some of these guys
that maybe weren't wrestlers that had to

3826
01:07:33,270 --> 01:07:33,280
that maybe weren't wrestlers that had to
 

3827
01:07:33,280 --> 01:07:34,150
that maybe weren't wrestlers that had to
wrestle russell

3828
01:07:34,150 --> 01:07:34,160
wrestle russell
 

3829
01:07:34,160 --> 01:07:36,710
wrestle russell
had to fight wrestling guys and stuff

3830
01:07:36,710 --> 01:07:36,720
had to fight wrestling guys and stuff
 

3831
01:07:36,720 --> 01:07:38,069
had to fight wrestling guys and stuff
missed a little bit there

3832
01:07:38,069 --> 01:07:38,079
missed a little bit there
 

3833
01:07:38,079 --> 01:07:39,670
missed a little bit there
but i think the ones that did have

3834
01:07:39,670 --> 01:07:39,680
but i think the ones that did have
 

3835
01:07:39,680 --> 01:07:41,430
but i think the ones that did have
wrestling probably have a really good

3836
01:07:41,430 --> 01:07:41,440
wrestling probably have a really good
 

3837
01:07:41,440 --> 01:07:43,349
wrestling probably have a really good
chance and can adapt to the other ones

3838
01:07:43,349 --> 01:07:43,359
chance and can adapt to the other ones
 

3839
01:07:43,359 --> 01:07:46,630
chance and can adapt to the other ones
but you know i think every martial art

3840
01:07:46,630 --> 01:07:46,640
but you know i think every martial art
 

3841
01:07:46,640 --> 01:07:47,910
but you know i think every martial art
or every activity is

3842
01:07:47,910 --> 01:07:47,920
or every activity is
 

3843
01:07:47,920 --> 01:07:49,750
or every activity is
good and you probably can't skip any but

3844
01:07:49,750 --> 01:07:49,760
good and you probably can't skip any but
 

3845
01:07:49,760 --> 01:07:51,029
good and you probably can't skip any but
i don't think they're ever going to

3846
01:07:51,029 --> 01:07:51,039
i don't think they're ever going to
 

3847
01:07:51,039 --> 01:07:54,309
i don't think they're ever going to
overlook and say that wrestling's

3848
01:07:54,309 --> 01:07:54,319
overlook and say that wrestling's
 

3849
01:07:54,319 --> 01:07:57,670
overlook and say that wrestling's

01:07:57,680 --> 01:07:59,829
pretty not are not valuable because
it is however that doesn't mean you're

3852
01:07:59,829 --> 01:07:59,839
it is however that doesn't mean you're
 

3853
01:07:59,839 --> 01:08:01,349
it is however that doesn't mean you're
going to make it you still got to take

3854
01:08:01,349 --> 01:08:01,359
going to make it you still got to take
 

3855
01:08:01,359 --> 01:08:03,349
going to make it you still got to take
the values and apply it

3856
01:08:03,349 --> 01:08:03,359
the values and apply it
 

3857
01:08:03,359 --> 01:08:05,589
the values and apply it
whatever area you're going to be in and
