00:03:01,830 --> 00:03:01,840
applied to your own life excited
 

165
00:03:01,840 --> 00:03:04,869
applied to your own life excited
excited oh even the dark stuff oh yeah

166
00:03:04,869 --> 00:03:04,879
excited oh even the dark stuff oh yeah
 

167
00:03:04,879 --> 00:03:07,430
excited oh even the dark stuff oh yeah
for sure definitely i mean also

168
00:03:07,430 --> 00:03:07,440
for sure definitely i mean also
 

169
00:03:07,440 --> 00:03:10,229
for sure definitely i mean also
that thing you're talking about it he

170
00:03:10,229 --> 00:03:10,239
that thing you're talking about it he
 

171
00:03:10,239 --> 00:03:12,229
that thing you're talking about it he
he kind of leaves out

172
00:03:12,229 --> 00:03:12,239
he kind of leaves out
 

173
00:03:12,239 --> 00:03:13,589
he kind of leaves out
maybe on purpose because the thought

174
00:03:13,589 --> 00:03:13,599
maybe on purpose because the thought
 

175
00:03:13,599 --> 00:03:15,430
maybe on purpose because the thought
experiment starts falling apart a little

176
00:03:15,430 --> 00:03:15,440
experiment starts falling apart a little
 

177
00:03:15,440 --> 00:03:19,190
experiment starts falling apart a little
bit yeah the amnesia between each loop

178
00:03:19,190 --> 00:03:19,200
bit yeah the amnesia between each loop
 

179
00:03:19,200 --> 00:03:20,470
bit yeah the amnesia between each loop
so

180
00:03:20,470 --> 00:03:20,480
so
 

181
00:03:20,480 --> 00:03:22,470
so
you know the whole thing gets wiped now

182
00:03:22,470 --> 00:03:22,480
you know the whole thing gets wiped now
 

183
00:03:22,480 --> 00:03:24,550
you know the whole thing gets wiped now
if the amnesia wasn't there and yet

184
00:03:24,550 --> 00:03:24,560
if the amnesia wasn't there and yet
 

185
00:03:24,560 --> 00:03:26,070
if the amnesia wasn't there and yet
somehow you were

186
00:03:26,070 --> 00:03:26,080
somehow you were
 

187
00:03:26,080 --> 00:03:29,430
somehow you were
witnessing the non-autonomy

188
00:03:29,430 --> 00:03:29,440
witnessing the non-autonomy
 

189
00:03:29,440 --> 00:03:31,110
witnessing the non-autonomy
implicit in what he's talking about so

190
00:03:31,110 --> 00:03:31,120
implicit in what he's talking about so
 

191
00:03:31,120 --> 00:03:32,869
implicit in what he's talking about so
you have to kind of watch yourself go

192
00:03:32,869 --> 00:03:32,879
you have to kind of watch yourself go
 

193
00:03:32,879 --> 00:03:35,589
you have to kind of watch yourself go
through this rotten loop then yeah

194
00:03:35,589 --> 00:03:35,599
through this rotten loop then yeah
 

195
00:03:35,599 --> 00:03:36,869
through this rotten loop then yeah
that's a description there's probably a

196
00:03:36,869 --> 00:03:36,879
that's a description there's probably a
 

197
00:03:36,879 --> 00:03:39,030
that's a description there's probably a
boredom that comes into that so you

198
00:03:39,030 --> 00:03:39,040
boredom that comes into that so you
 

199
00:03:39,040 --> 00:03:41,750
boredom that comes into that so you
don't experience everything anew exactly

200
00:03:41,750 --> 00:03:41,760
don't experience everything anew exactly
 

201
00:03:41,760 --> 00:03:43,430
don't experience everything anew exactly
the best stuff the good stuff the

202
00:03:43,430 --> 00:03:43,440
the best stuff the good stuff the
 

203
00:03:43,440 --> 00:03:45,270
the best stuff the good stuff the
newness of it is really important that's

204
00:03:45,270 --> 00:03:45,280
newness of it is really important that's
 

205
00:03:45,280 --> 00:03:47,190
newness of it is really important that's
it yeah this is the uh

206
00:03:47,190 --> 00:03:47,200
it yeah this is the uh
 

207
00:03:47,200 --> 00:03:49,830
it yeah this is the uh
in the in hades when you die

208
00:03:49,830 --> 00:03:49,840
in the in hades when you die
 

209
00:03:49,840 --> 00:03:50,869
in the in hades when you die
you

210
00:03:50,869 --> 00:03:50,879
you
 

211
00:03:50,879 --> 00:03:52,550
you
there's a river i think it's called leaf

212
00:03:52,550 --> 00:03:52,560
there's a river i think it's called leaf
 

213
00:03:52,560 --> 00:03:54,390
there's a river i think it's called leaf
you ever heard of this l-e-t-h-e you

214
00:03:54,390 --> 00:03:54,400
you ever heard of this l-e-t-h-e you
 

215
00:03:54,400 --> 00:03:56,149
you ever heard of this l-e-t-h-e you
drink from it and you don't remember

216
00:03:56,149 --> 00:03:56,159
drink from it and you don't remember
 

217
00:03:56,159 --> 00:03:58,550
drink from it and you don't remember
your past lives and then when you're

218
00:03:58,550 --> 00:03:58,560
your past lives and then when you're
 

219
00:03:58,560 --> 00:04:01,270
your past lives and then when you're
reborn it's fresh and you don't have to

220
00:04:01,270 --> 00:04:01,280
reborn it's fresh and you don't have to
 

221
00:04:01,280 --> 00:04:03,830
reborn it's fresh and you don't have to
i mean just think of like the amount of

222
00:04:03,830 --> 00:04:03,840
i mean just think of like the amount of
 

223
00:04:03,840 --> 00:04:06,789
i mean just think of like the amount of
psychological help you would need to get

224
00:04:06,789 --> 00:04:06,799
psychological help you would need to get
 

225
00:04:06,799 --> 00:04:08,789
psychological help you would need to get
over all the [\h__\h] that happened in

226
00:04:08,789 --> 00:04:08,799
over all the [\h__\h] that happened in
 

227
00:04:08,799 --> 00:04:10,550
over all the [\h__\h] that happened in
prior lives

228
00:04:10,550 --> 00:04:10,560
prior lives
 

229
00:04:10,560 --> 00:04:12,830
prior lives
you know can you imagine if you're still

230
00:04:12,830 --> 00:04:12,840
you know can you imagine if you're still
 

231
00:04:12,840 --> 00:04:14,869
you know can you imagine if you're still
resentful of something someone did to

232
00:04:14,869 --> 00:04:14,879
resentful of something someone did to
 

233
00:04:14,879 --> 00:04:16,789
resentful of something someone did to
you in the 14th century

234
00:04:16,789 --> 00:04:16,799
you in the 14th century
 

235
00:04:16,799 --> 00:04:19,430
you in the 14th century
but it would it would compound well if

236
00:04:19,430 --> 00:04:19,440
but it would it would compound well if
 

237
00:04:19,440 --> 00:04:20,870
but it would it would compound well if
you repeat the same thing over and over

238
00:04:20,870 --> 00:04:20,880
you repeat the same thing over and over
 

239
00:04:20,880 --> 00:04:22,230
you repeat the same thing over and over
and over

240
00:04:22,230 --> 00:04:22,240
and over
 

241
00:04:22,240 --> 00:04:24,230
and over
there would be no difference maybe you

242
00:04:24,230 --> 00:04:24,240
there would be no difference maybe you
 

243
00:04:24,240 --> 00:04:26,550
there would be no difference maybe you
would start to appreciate the nuances

244
00:04:26,550 --> 00:04:26,560
would start to appreciate the nuances
 

245
00:04:26,560 --> 00:04:27,909
would start to appreciate the nuances
more like when you watch the same movie

246
00:04:27,909 --> 00:04:27,919
more like when you watch the same movie
 

247
00:04:27,919 --> 00:04:29,990
more like when you watch the same movie
over and over and over yeah maybe you'll

248
00:04:29,990 --> 00:04:30,000
over and over and over yeah maybe you'll
 

249
00:04:30,000 --> 00:04:31,510
over and over and over yeah maybe you'll
get to

250
00:04:31,510 --> 00:04:31,520
get to
 

251
00:04:31,520 --> 00:04:33,030
get to
actually

252
00:04:33,030 --> 00:04:33,040
actually
 

253
00:04:33,040 --> 00:04:34,070
actually
um

254
00:04:34,070 --> 00:04:34,080
um
 

255
00:04:34,080 --> 00:04:37,430
um
let go of this idea of all the possible

256
00:04:37,430 --> 00:04:37,440
let go of this idea of all the possible
 

257
00:04:37,440 --> 00:04:39,110
let go of this idea of all the possible
all the positive possibilities that lay

258
00:04:39,110 --> 00:04:39,120
all the positive possibilities that lay
 

259
00:04:39,120 --> 00:04:40,629
all the positive possibilities that lay
before you but actually enjoy the moment

260
00:04:40,629 --> 00:04:40,639
before you but actually enjoy the moment
 

261
00:04:40,639 --> 00:04:42,310
before you but actually enjoy the moment
much more if you remember that you've

262
00:04:42,310 --> 00:04:42,320
much more if you remember that you've
 

263
00:04:42,320 --> 00:04:44,550
much more if you remember that you've
lived this life a thousand times all the

264
00:04:44,550 --> 00:04:44,560
lived this life a thousand times all the
 

265
00:04:44,560 --> 00:04:46,870
lived this life a thousand times all the
little things the way somebody smiles

266
00:04:46,870 --> 00:04:46,880
little things the way somebody smiles
 

267
00:04:46,880 --> 00:04:48,790
little things the way somebody smiles
uh if you're been abused the way

268
00:04:48,790 --> 00:04:48,800
uh if you're been abused the way
 

269
00:04:48,800 --> 00:04:50,950
uh if you're been abused the way
somebody like the pain of it

270
00:04:50,950 --> 00:04:50,960
somebody like the pain of it
 

271
00:04:50,960 --> 00:04:53,189
somebody like the pain of it

the the suffering the down that you feel
the experience of sadness depression

274
00:04:55,909 --> 00:04:55,919
the experience of sadness depression
 

275
00:04:55,919 --> 00:04:57,270
the experience of sadness depression
fear all that kind of stuff you get to

276
00:04:57,270 --> 00:04:57,280
fear all that kind of stuff you get to
 

277
00:04:57,280 --> 00:04:58,070
fear all that kind of stuff you get to
really

278
00:04:58,070 --> 00:04:58,080
really
 

279
00:04:58,080 --> 00:04:59,909
really
uh yeah you get to also appreciate that

280
00:04:59,909 --> 00:04:59,919
uh yeah you get to also appreciate that
 

281
00:04:59,919 --> 00:05:01,830
uh yeah you get to also appreciate that
that's part of life yeah part of being a

282
00:05:01,830 --> 00:05:01,840
that's part of life yeah part of being a
 

283
00:05:01,840 --> 00:05:02,710
that's part of life yeah part of being a
life

284
00:05:02,710 --> 00:05:02,720
life
 

285
00:05:02,720 --> 00:05:04,550
life
now also in his experiment if i was

286
00:05:04,550 --> 00:05:04,560
now also in his experiment if i was
 

287
00:05:04,560 --> 00:05:06,230
now also in his experiment if i was
gonna and i love the experiment from the

288
00:05:06,230 --> 00:05:06,240
gonna and i love the experiment from the
 

289
00:05:06,240 --> 00:05:07,909
gonna and i love the experiment from the
perspective of like just where

290
00:05:07,909 --> 00:05:07,919
perspective of like just where
 

291
00:05:07,919 --> 00:05:10,150
perspective of like just where
technology is now and simulation theory

292
00:05:10,150 --> 00:05:10,160
technology is now and simulation theory
 

293
00:05:10,160 --> 00:05:11,990
technology is now and simulation theory
and stuff like that but

294
00:05:11,990 --> 00:05:12,000
and stuff like that but
 

295
00:05:12,000 --> 00:05:14,870
and stuff like that but
in that in that thought experiment if

296
00:05:14,870 --> 00:05:14,880
in that in that thought experiment if
 

297
00:05:14,880 --> 00:05:17,270
in that in that thought experiment if
this rotten demon

298
00:05:17,270 --> 00:05:17,280
this rotten demon
 

299
00:05:17,280 --> 00:05:19,830
this rotten demon
immediately killed you

300
00:05:19,830 --> 00:05:19,840
immediately killed you
 

301
00:05:19,840 --> 00:05:22,390
immediately killed you
then within that it's a little more

302
00:05:22,390 --> 00:05:22,400
then within that it's a little more
 

303
00:05:22,400 --> 00:05:26,230
then within that it's a little more
horrifying because even in the

304
00:05:26,230 --> 00:05:26,240
horrifying because even in the
 

305
00:05:26,240 --> 00:05:27,830
horrifying because even in the
first of all you're trusting a [\h__\h]

306
00:05:27,830 --> 00:05:27,840
first of all you're trusting a [\h__\h]
 

307
00:05:27,840 --> 00:05:29,590
first of all you're trusting a [\h__\h]
demon why are you talking to a demon

308
00:05:29,590 --> 00:05:29,600
demon why are you talking to a demon
 

309
00:05:29,600 --> 00:05:31,189
demon why are you talking to a demon
yeah start there yeah because that is

310
00:05:31,189 --> 00:05:31,199
yeah start there yeah because that is
 

311
00:05:31,199 --> 00:05:32,629
yeah start there yeah because that is
going to be even before i get into like

312
00:05:32,629 --> 00:05:32,639
going to be even before i get into like
 

313
00:05:32,639 --> 00:05:34,150
going to be even before i get into like
the metaphysics and like the

314
00:05:34,150 --> 00:05:34,160
the metaphysics and like the
 

315
00:05:34,160 --> 00:05:35,990
the metaphysics and like the
implications and where is this life

316
00:05:35,990 --> 00:05:36,000
implications and where is this life
 

317
00:05:36,000 --> 00:05:38,070
implications and where is this life
stored where's the loop stored i mean

318
00:05:38,070 --> 00:05:38,080
stored where's the loop stored i mean
 

319
00:05:38,080 --> 00:05:39,510
stored where's the loop stored i mean
are we talking about some kind of

320
00:05:39,510 --> 00:05:39,520
are we talking about some kind of
 

321
00:05:39,520 --> 00:05:42,390
are we talking about some kind of
unchanging data set or something before

322
00:05:42,390 --> 00:05:42,400
unchanging data set or something before
 

323
00:05:42,400 --> 00:05:43,830
unchanging data set or something before
that you're like why is there a [\h__\h]

324
00:05:43,830 --> 00:05:43,840
that you're like why is there a [\h__\h]

kind of
 

449
00:07:47,440 --> 00:07:48,950
kind of
i mean there was a recursive nature to

450
00:07:48,950 --> 00:07:48,960
i mean there was a recursive nature to
 

451
00:07:48,960 --> 00:07:51,510
i mean there was a recursive nature to
it but it seemed

452
00:07:51,510 --> 00:07:51,520
it but it seemed
 

453
00:07:51,520 --> 00:07:53,029
it but it seemed

the richness of life could be

458
00:07:56,830 --> 00:07:56,840
the richness of life could be
 

459
00:07:56,840 --> 00:07:59,670
the richness of life could be
experienced through the replay that's

460
00:07:59,670 --> 00:07:59,680
experienced through the replay that's
 

461
00:07:59,680 --> 00:08:01,670
experienced through the replay that's
probably where it's experienced the most

462
00:08:01,670 --> 00:08:01,680
probably where it's experienced the most
 

463
00:08:01,680 --> 00:08:03,749
probably where it's experienced the most
like you could see life as a way to

then you get to sit back in your nice vr
 

469
00:08:07,919 --> 00:08:10,309
then you get to sit back in your nice vr
headset and replay the cool ones that's

reincarnating of not coming back that's
 

479

nietzsche's loop
 

493
00:08:35,919 --> 00:08:37,829

and look at it from

and look at it from

00:08:37,839 --> 00:08:39,670
and look at it from

then

then
 

501
00:08:44,240 --> 00:08:46,550
then
to me it makes a lot of sense like i've

502
00:08:46,550 --> 00:08:46,560
to me it makes a lot of sense like i've
 

503
00:08:46,560 --> 00:08:48,230
to me it makes a lot of sense like i've
been thinking a lot about this very

00:08:48,230 --> 00:08:48,240
been thinking a lot about this very
 

505
00:08:48,240 --> 00:08:50,070
been thinking a lot about this very
thing and that nietzsche's idea

connecting to it i had this like
 

509
00:08:53,600 --> 00:08:55,350
connecting to it i had this like
it sounds so dumb but i was at the

in simulation theory one of the big

00:10:13,200 --> 00:10:15,910
in simulation theory one of the big

elon has talked about well it's probably
 

587
00:10:20,240 --> 00:10:21,910
elon has talked about well it's probably
more of a probability than we're in one

more of a probability than we're in one

00:10:21,920 --> 00:10:24,389
more of a probability than we're in one
then we're not in which case what you're

is actually happening that that loop
 

595
00:10:28,560 --> 00:10:31,110
is actually happening that that loop
you're talking about it's we've decided

00:10:34,640 --> 00:10:36,870
to be here we this of all the things
we decided this one oh let's do that one

00:10:36,870 --> 00:10:36,880
we decided this one oh let's do that one
 

601
00:10:36,880 --> 00:10:38,949
we decided this one oh let's do that one
again i want to do that one let's try

602
00:10:38,949 --> 00:10:38,959
again i want to do that one let's try
 

603
00:10:38,959 --> 00:10:40,630
again i want to do that one let's try
let's do that that's

00:10:42,560 --> 00:10:44,630
i love thinking about this because i got
i love my family yeah and it makes sense

608
00:10:44,630 --> 00:10:44,640
i love my family yeah and it makes sense
 

609
00:10:44,640 --> 00:10:47,110
i love my family yeah and it makes sense
to me that if i'm going to replay some

610
00:10:47,110 --> 00:10:47,120
to me that if i'm going to replay some
 

611
00:10:47,120 --> 00:10:48,630
to me that if i'm going to replay some
life or another it's definitely going to

all the [\h__\h] that's gone along with
 

617
00:10:53,200 --> 00:10:55,030
all the [\h__\h] that's gone along with

pick from yeah but there's a whole uh
illusion of free will that's happening

646
00:11:24,550 --> 00:11:24,560
illusion of free will that's happening
 

647
00:11:24,560 --> 00:11:27,350
illusion of free will that's happening
we really do depending where you are in

648
00:11:27,350 --> 00:11:27,360
we really do depending where you are in
 

649
00:11:27,360 --> 00:11:29,350
we really do depending where you are in
the world feel like you're free to

650
00:11:29,350 --> 00:11:29,360
the world feel like you're free to
 

651
00:11:29,360 --> 00:11:31,430
the world feel like you're free to
decide any trajectory in your life that

652
00:11:31,430 --> 00:11:31,440
decide any trajectory in your life that
 

653
00:11:31,440 --> 00:11:33,509
decide any trajectory in your life that
you want which is pretty funny right for

654
00:11:33,509 --> 00:11:33,519
you want which is pretty funny right for
 

655
00:11:33,519 --> 00:11:36,389
you want which is pretty funny right for
an npc is pretty it's nice well you're

656
00:11:36,389 --> 00:11:36,399
an npc is pretty it's nice well you're
 

657
00:11:36,399 --> 00:11:37,829
an npc is pretty it's nice well you're
gonna want that if we're making a video

658
00:11:37,829 --> 00:11:37,839
gonna want that if we're making a video
 

659
00:11:37,839 --> 00:11:40,389
gonna want that if we're making a video
game you do want to give your npcs the

660
00:11:40,389 --> 00:11:40,399
game you do want to give your npcs the
 

661
00:11:40,399 --> 00:11:41,750
game you do want to give your npcs the
illusion of free will because it's going

662
00:11:41,750 --> 00:11:41,760
illusion of free will because it's going
 

663
00:11:41,760 --> 00:11:43,990
illusion of free will because it's going
to make interactions with him that's

664
00:11:43,990 --> 00:11:44,000
to make interactions with him that's
 

665
00:11:44,000 --> 00:11:47,430
to make interactions with him that's
that much more intense

666
00:11:47,430 --> 00:11:47,440

 

667
00:11:47,440 --> 00:11:48,710

yeah

668
00:11:48,710 --> 00:11:48,720
yeah
 

669
00:11:48,720 --> 00:11:52,230
yeah
so i wonder on the path to that

670
00:11:52,230 --> 00:11:52,240
so i wonder on the path to that
 

671
00:11:52,240 --> 00:11:54,629
so i wonder on the path to that
how how hard is it to create this is the

672
00:11:54,629 --> 00:11:54,639
how how hard is it to create this is the
 

673
00:11:54,639 --> 00:11:57,430
how how hard is it to create this is the
sort of the carmack question of um

674
00:11:57,430 --> 00:11:57,440
sort of the carmack question of um
 

675
00:11:57,440 --> 00:11:59,829
sort of the carmack question of um
a realistic virtual world

676
00:11:59,829 --> 00:11:59,839
a realistic virtual world
 

677
00:11:59,839 --> 00:12:03,030
a realistic virtual world
that's as cool as this one not fully

678
00:12:03,030 --> 00:12:03,040
that's as cool as this one not fully
 

679
00:12:03,040 --> 00:12:05,670
that's as cool as this one not fully
realistic but sufficiently realistic

680
00:12:05,670 --> 00:12:05,680
realistic but sufficiently realistic
 

681
00:12:05,680 --> 00:12:06,870
realistic but sufficiently realistic
that it's

682
00:12:06,870 --> 00:12:06,880
that it's
 

683
00:12:06,880 --> 00:12:09,110
that it's
as interesting to live in because we're

684
00:12:09,110 --> 00:12:09,120
as interesting to live in because we're
 

685
00:12:09,120 --> 00:12:10,949
as interesting to live in because we're
going to create those worlds

686
00:12:10,949 --> 00:12:10,959
going to create those worlds
 

687
00:12:10,959 --> 00:12:13,350
going to create those worlds
on the path to creating something

688
00:12:13,350 --> 00:12:13,360
on the path to creating something
 

689
00:12:13,360 --> 00:12:15,829
on the path to creating something
like a simulation yes like long long

690
00:12:15,829 --> 00:12:15,839
like a simulation yes like long long
 

691
00:12:15,839 --> 00:12:17,990
like a simulation yes like long long
long before it'll be virtual worlds

692
00:12:17,990 --> 00:12:18,000
long before it'll be virtual worlds
 

693
00:12:18,000 --> 00:12:20,230
long before it'll be virtual worlds
where we want to stay forever because

694
00:12:20,230 --> 00:12:20,240
where we want to stay forever because
 

695
00:12:20,240 --> 00:12:21,990
where we want to stay forever because
they're full of

696
00:12:21,990 --> 00:12:22,000
they're full of
 

697
00:12:22,000 --> 00:12:24,470
they're full of
they're full of uh

698
00:12:24,470 --> 00:12:24,480
they're full of uh
 

699
00:12:24,480 --> 00:12:27,269
they're full of uh
that balance of suffering and joy of

700
00:12:27,269 --> 00:12:27,279
that balance of suffering and joy of
 

701
00:12:27,279 --> 00:12:29,190
that balance of suffering and joy of
limitations and freedoms and all that

702
00:12:29,190 --> 00:12:29,200
limitations and freedoms and all that
 

703
00:12:29,200 --> 00:12:30,710
limitations and freedoms and all that
kind of stuff a lot of people think like

704
00:12:30,710 --> 00:12:30,720
kind of stuff a lot of people think like
 

705
00:12:30,720 --> 00:12:32,870
kind of stuff a lot of people think like
in the virtual world i can't wait to be

706
00:12:32,870 --> 00:12:32,880
in the virtual world i can't wait to be
 

707
00:12:32,880 --> 00:12:34,150
in the virtual world i can't wait to be
able to

708
00:12:34,150 --> 00:12:34,160
able to
 

709
00:12:34,160 --> 00:12:35,190

718
00:12:44,710 --> 00:12:44,720
you want the limitations the constraints
 

719
00:12:44,720 --> 00:12:46,470
you want the limitations the constraints

world of warcraft in its original

728
00:12:56,069 --> 00:12:56,079
world of warcraft in its original
 

729
00:12:56,079 --> 00:12:57,670
world of warcraft in its original
incarnation

730
00:12:57,670 --> 00:12:57,680
incarnation
 

731
00:12:57,680 --> 00:12:59,750
incarnation
and i didn't even know that you were

732
00:12:59,750 --> 00:12:59,760
and i didn't even know that you were

gonna have flying mounts like i didn't
even know so i've been running around

736
00:13:03,190 --> 00:13:03,200
even know so i've been running around
 

737
00:13:03,200 --> 00:13:05,269
even know so i've been running around
dealing with all the encumbrances of

738
00:13:05,269 --> 00:13:05,279
dealing with all the encumbrances of
 

739
00:13:05,279 --> 00:13:07,750
dealing with all the encumbrances of
like being an undead warlock that can't

740
00:13:07,750 --> 00:13:07,760
like being an undead warlock that can't
 

741
00:13:07,760 --> 00:13:10,949
like being an undead warlock that can't
fly but then all of a sudden holy [\h__\h]

742
00:13:10,949 --> 00:13:10,959
fly but then all of a sudden holy [\h__\h]
 

743
00:13:10,959 --> 00:13:12,710
fly but then all of a sudden holy [\h__\h]
there's flying mounts and now the world

744
00:13:12,710 --> 00:13:12,720
there's flying mounts and now the world
 

745
00:13:12,720 --> 00:13:14,230
there's flying mounts and now the world
you've been running around

746
00:13:14,230 --> 00:13:14,240
you've been running around
 

747
00:13:14,240 --> 00:13:15,990
you've been running around
not flying you're seeing it from the top

748
00:13:15,990 --> 00:13:16,000
not flying you're seeing it from the top
 

749
00:13:16,000 --> 00:13:18,629
not flying you're seeing it from the top
down it's just really cool like whoa i

750
00:13:18,629 --> 00:13:18,639
down it's just really cool like whoa i
 

751
00:13:18,639 --> 00:13:20,790
down it's just really cool like whoa i
can do this now and then that gets

752
00:13:20,790 --> 00:13:20,800
can do this now and then that gets
 

753
00:13:20,800 --> 00:13:24,150
can do this now and then that gets
boring but a really well-designed game

754
00:13:24,150 --> 00:13:24,160
boring but a really well-designed game
 

755
00:13:24,160 --> 00:13:27,430
boring but a really well-designed game
it it has a series of these i don't know

756
00:13:27,430 --> 00:13:27,440
it it has a series of these i don't know
 

757
00:13:27,440 --> 00:13:28,790
it it has a series of these i don't know
what you call it uh

758
00:13:28,790 --> 00:13:28,800
what you call it uh
 

759
00:13:28,800 --> 00:13:31,670
what you call it uh
extra abilities that kind of unfold and

760
00:13:31,670 --> 00:13:31,680
extra abilities that kind of unfold and
 

761
00:13:31,680 --> 00:13:34,870
extra abilities that kind of unfold and
produce novelty and then eventually you

762
00:13:34,870 --> 00:13:34,880
produce novelty and then eventually you
 

763
00:13:34,880 --> 00:13:36,949
produce novelty and then eventually you
just accept it you take it for granted

764
00:13:36,949 --> 00:13:36,959
just accept it you take it for granted
 

765
00:13:36,959 --> 00:13:38,710
just accept it you take it for granted
and then another

766
00:13:38,710 --> 00:13:38,720
and then another
 

767
00:13:38,720 --> 00:13:40,949
and then another
novelty appears so those extra abilities

768
00:13:40,949 --> 00:13:40,959
novelty appears so those extra abilities
 

769
00:13:40,959 --> 00:13:42,710
novelty appears so those extra abilities
are always balanced with the limitations

770
00:13:42,710 --> 00:13:42,720
are always balanced with the limitations
 

771
00:13:42,720 --> 00:13:44,710
are always balanced with the limitations
the constraints they run up against

772
00:13:44,710 --> 00:13:44,720
the constraints they run up against
 

773
00:13:44,720 --> 00:13:48,470
the constraints they run up against
because a a well-balanced video game the

774
00:13:48,470 --> 00:13:48,480
because a a well-balanced video game the
 

775
00:13:48,480 --> 00:13:50,790
because a a well-balanced video game the
challenge the struggle matches the new

776
00:13:50,790 --> 00:13:50,800
challenge the struggle matches the new
 

777
00:13:50,800 --> 00:13:53,030
challenge the struggle matches the new
ability yeah and sometimes causes

778
00:13:53,030 --> 00:13:53,040
ability yeah and sometimes causes
 

779
00:13:53,040 --> 00:13:54,470
ability yeah and sometimes causes
problems on its own

780
00:13:54,470 --> 00:13:54,480
problems on its own
 

781
00:13:54,480 --> 00:13:56,790
problems on its own
i mean and so to go back to

782
00:13:56,790 --> 00:13:56,800
i mean and so to go back to
 

783
00:13:56,800 --> 00:13:59,350
i mean and so to go back to
this universe's simulation

784
00:13:59,350 --> 00:13:59,360
this universe's simulation
 

785
00:13:59,360 --> 00:14:01,430
this universe's simulation
it's really designed like a pretty

786
00:14:01,430 --> 00:14:01,440
it's really designed like a pretty
 

787
00:14:01,440 --> 00:14:03,350
it's really designed like a pretty
awesome video game if you look at it

788
00:14:03,350 --> 00:14:03,360
awesome video game if you look at it
 

789
00:14:03,360 --> 00:14:06,629
awesome video game if you look at it
from the perspective of history i mean

790
00:14:06,629 --> 00:14:06,639
from the perspective of history i mean
 

791
00:14:06,639 --> 00:14:08,710
from the perspective of history i mean
people were on horses they didn't know

792
00:14:08,710 --> 00:14:08,720
people were on horses they didn't know
 

793
00:14:08,720 --> 00:14:10,389
people were on horses they didn't know
that they were going to be bullet trains

794
00:14:10,389 --> 00:14:10,399
that they were going to be bullet trains
 

795
00:14:10,399 --> 00:14:12,310
that they were going to be bullet trains
they didn't know that you could get in a

796
00:14:12,310 --> 00:14:12,320
they didn't know that you could get in a
 

797
00:14:12,320 --> 00:14:15,110
they didn't know that you could get in a
car and drive across the country in a

798
00:14:15,110 --> 00:14:15,120
car and drive across the country in a
 

799
00:14:15,120 --> 00:14:16,470
car and drive across the country in a
few days that would have sounded

800
00:14:16,470 --> 00:14:16,480
few days that would have sounded
 

801
00:14:16,480 --> 00:14:18,790
few days that would have sounded
ridiculous we're doing that now and even

802
00:14:18,790 --> 00:14:18,800
ridiculous we're doing that now and even
 

803
00:14:18,800 --> 00:14:19,829
ridiculous we're doing that now and even
in our own

804
00:14:19,829 --> 00:14:19,839
in our own

going to catch on it's too big it's

822
00:14:41,030 --> 00:14:41,040
going to catch on it's too big it's
 

823
00:14:41,040 --> 00:14:44,069
going to catch on it's too big it's
unwieldy the graphics suck and then look

824
00:14:44,069 --> 00:14:44,079
unwieldy the graphics suck and then look
 

825
00:14:44,079 --> 00:14:45,590
unwieldy the graphics suck and then look
at where it's at now

826
00:14:45,590 --> 00:14:45,600
at where it's at now
 

827
00:14:45,600 --> 00:14:47,910
at where it's at now
and that's going to keep

828
00:14:47,910 --> 00:14:47,920
and that's going to keep
 

829
00:14:47,920 --> 00:14:49,350
and that's going to keep
that trajectory is going to keep

830
00:14:49,350 --> 00:14:49,360
that trajectory is going to keep
 

831
00:14:49,360 --> 00:14:52,150
that trajectory is going to keep
improving so yeah i think that

832
00:14:52,150 --> 00:14:52,160

the digital world maybe there should be
 

881
00:15:44,480 --> 00:15:46,230
the digital world maybe there should be
a lot of jealousy in the digital world

a lot of jealousy in the digital world
 

883
00:15:46,240 --> 00:15:48,550
a lot of jealousy in the digital world
because that's jealousy

884

00:15:54,160 --> 00:15:55,269
yeah even in the digital world yeah so
you're gonna have to simulate all of

892
00:15:55,269 --> 00:15:55,279
you're gonna have to simulate all of
 

893
00:15:55,279 --> 00:15:56,790
you're gonna have to simulate all of
that kind of stuff but i wonder what the

894
00:15:56,790 --> 00:15:56,800
that kind of stuff but i wonder what the
 

895
00:15:56,800 --> 00:15:58,949
that kind of stuff but i wonder what the
magic thing that says i want to spend

896
00:15:58,949 --> 00:15:58,959

most of my days inside the virtual world
 

899
00:16:01,600 --> 00:16:02,949
most of my days inside the virtual world
well

900
00:16:02,949 --> 00:16:02,959
well
 

901
00:16:02,959 --> 00:16:05,030
well
clearly it's gonna be something we don't

902
00:16:05,030 --> 00:16:05,040
clearly it's gonna be something we don't
 

903
00:16:05,040 --> 00:16:06,790
clearly it's gonna be something we don't
have yet i mean strapping that damn

it's heavy
if you're depending on what what gear

910
00:16:11,590 --> 00:16:11,600
if you're depending on what what gear
 

911
00:16:11,600 --> 00:16:13,749
if you're depending on what what gear
you're using sometimes light can leak in

912
00:16:13,749 --> 00:16:13,759
you're using sometimes light can leak in
 

913
00:16:13,759 --> 00:16:15,910
you're using sometimes light can leak in
there's just you gotta recharge it it's

914
00:16:15,910 --> 00:16:15,920
there's just you gotta recharge it it's
 

915
00:16:15,920 --> 00:16:17,829
there's just you gotta recharge it it's
hyper limited and then

916
00:16:17,829 --> 00:16:17,839
hyper limited and then
 

917
00:16:17,839 --> 00:16:18,870
hyper limited and then
so

918
00:16:18,870 --> 00:16:18,880
so
 

919
00:16:18,880 --> 00:16:19,670
so
yeah

920
00:16:19,670 --> 00:16:19,680
yeah
 

921
00:16:19,680 --> 00:16:22,870
yeah
it's gonna have to be

922
00:16:22,870 --> 00:16:22,880
it's gonna have to be
 

923
00:16:22,880 --> 00:16:24,389
it's gonna have to be
something that like

924
00:16:24,389 --> 00:16:24,399
something that like
 

925
00:16:24,399 --> 00:16:26,629

talking about that happen it has to be
 

941
00:16:43,279 --> 00:16:45,670
talking about that happen it has to be
fully immersive like you so that it's

942
00:16:45,670 --> 00:16:45,680
fully immersive like you so that it's
 

943
00:16:45,680 --> 00:16:47,430
fully immersive like you so that it's
not that you

because of some i don't know fan or
 

957
00:16:59,519 --> 00:17:01,269
because of some i don't know fan or
something that it's connected to but

958
00:17:01,269 --> 00:17:01,279
something that it's connected to but
 

959
00:17:01,279 --> 00:17:02,790
something that it's connected to but
because somehow

960
00:17:02,790 --> 00:17:02,800
because somehow
 

961
00:17:02,800 --> 00:17:04,870
because somehow
it's figured out how to

962
00:17:04,870 --> 00:17:04,880
it's figured out how to
 

963
00:17:04,880 --> 00:17:07,350
it's figured out how to
hack into the human brain and send those

964
00:17:07,350 --> 00:17:07,360
hack into the human brain and send those
 

965

gravity well it is attention gravity

1096
00:19:25,510 --> 00:19:25,520
gravity well it is attention gravity
 

1097
00:19:25,520 --> 00:19:27,110
gravity well it is attention gravity
well yeah when we weren't feeling the

1098
00:19:27,110 --> 00:19:27,120
well yeah when we weren't feeling the
 

1099
00:19:27,120 --> 00:19:29,430
well yeah when we weren't feeling the
pull of these things all the time you

1100
00:19:29,430 --> 00:19:29,440
pull of these things all the time you
 

1101
00:19:29,440 --> 00:19:31,190
pull of these things all the time you
would just read and you weren't patting

1102
00:19:31,190 --> 00:19:31,200
would just read and you weren't patting
 

1103
00:19:31,200 --> 00:19:33,110
would just read and you weren't patting
yourself on the back about reading you

1104
00:19:33,110 --> 00:19:33,120
yourself on the back about reading you
 

1105
00:19:33,120 --> 00:19:34,789
yourself on the back about reading you
just that's what you had you had that

1106
00:19:34,789 --> 00:19:34,799
just that's what you had you had that
 

1107
00:19:34,799 --> 00:19:35,990
just that's what you had you had that
and you had like

1108

you know then a lot of people stop

1114
00:19:41,909 --> 00:19:41,919
you know then a lot of people stop
 

1115
00:19:41,919 --> 00:19:43,510
you know then a lot of people stop
reading because of these things you know

1116
00:19:43,510 --> 00:19:43,520
reading because of these things you know
 

1117
00:19:43,520 --> 00:19:44,630
reading because of these things you know
or they think they're reading because

1118
00:19:44,630 --> 00:19:44,640
or they think they're reading because
 

1119
00:19:44,640 --> 00:19:46,789
or they think they're reading because
they're on they are technically reading

1120
00:19:46,789 --> 00:19:46,799
they're on they are technically reading
 

1121
00:19:46,799 --> 00:19:49,350
they're on they are technically reading
but you know when you return to reading

1122
00:19:49,350 --> 00:19:49,360
but you know when you return to reading
 

1123
00:19:49,360 --> 00:19:51,750
but you know when you return to reading
after a pause whoa

1124
00:19:51,750 --> 00:19:51,760
after a pause whoa
 

1125
00:19:51,760 --> 00:19:53,590
after a pause whoa

whoa holy [\h__\h] it's incredible i mean

1132
00:20:00,070 --> 00:20:00,080
whoa holy [\h__\h] it's incredible i mean
 

1133
00:20:00,080 --> 00:20:01,909
whoa holy [\h__\h] it's incredible i mean
it's like

1134
00:20:01,909 --> 00:20:01,919
it's like
 

1135
00:20:01,919 --> 00:20:03,590
it's like
again it's the most embarrassing kind of

1136
00:20:03,590 --> 00:20:03,600
again it's the most embarrassing kind of
 

1137
00:20:03,600 --> 00:20:04,950

wow what do you know books are really

1140
00:20:06,710 --> 00:20:06,720
wow what do you know books are really
 

1141
00:20:06,720 --> 00:20:08,710
wow what do you know books are really
good yeah but still if you've been away

1142
00:20:08,710 --> 00:20:08,720
good yeah but still if you've been away
 

1143
00:20:08,720 --> 00:20:10,390
good yeah but still if you've been away
from it for a while and you revisit i

1144
00:20:10,390 --> 00:20:10,400
from it for a while and you revisit i
 

1145
00:20:10,400 --> 00:20:11,750
from it for a while and you revisit i
know what you're saying

1146
00:20:11,750 --> 00:20:11,760
know what you're saying
 

1147
00:20:11,760 --> 00:20:13,909
know what you're saying
i just think probably

1148
00:20:13,909 --> 00:20:13,919
i just think probably
 

1149
00:20:13,919 --> 00:20:14,789
i just think probably
it's

1150
00:20:14,789 --> 00:20:14,799
it's
 

1151
00:20:14,799 --> 00:20:16,710
it's
not going to go in that direction even

1152
00:20:16,710 --> 00:20:16,720
not going to go in that direction even
 

1153
00:20:16,720 --> 00:20:18,870
not going to go in that direction even
though you are right ultimately i think

1154
00:20:18,870 --> 00:20:18,880
though you are right ultimately i think
 

1155
00:20:18,880 --> 00:20:20,630
though you are right ultimately i think
you're right yeah because our our brain

1156
00:20:20,630 --> 00:20:20,640
you're right yeah because our our brain
 

1157
00:20:20,640 --> 00:20:23,830
you're right yeah because our our brain
is the imagination engine we have is

1158
00:20:23,830 --> 00:20:23,840
is the imagination engine we have is
 

1159
00:20:23,840 --> 00:20:25,669
is the imagination engine we have is
able to fill in the gaps better than a

1160
00:20:25,669 --> 00:20:25,679
able to fill in the gaps better than a
 

1161
00:20:25,679 --> 00:20:27,750
able to fill in the gaps better than a
lot of graphics engines could right and

1162
00:20:27,750 --> 00:20:27,760
lot of graphics engines could right and
 

1163
00:20:27,760 --> 00:20:29,430
lot of graphics engines could right and
so if there's a way to incentivize

1164
00:20:29,430 --> 00:20:29,440
so if there's a way to incentivize
 

1165
00:20:29,440 --> 00:20:31,590
so if there's a way to incentivize
humans to become addicted to the use of

1166
00:20:31,590 --> 00:20:31,600
humans to become addicted to the use of
 

1167
00:20:31,600 --> 00:20:33,830
humans to become addicted to the use of
imagination it's like you know that's

1168
00:20:33,830 --> 00:20:33,840
imagination it's like you know that's
 

1169
00:20:33,840 --> 00:20:36,070
imagination it's like you know that's
the downside of things like porn that

1170
00:20:36,070 --> 00:20:36,080
the downside of things like porn that
 

1171
00:20:36,080 --> 00:20:38,549
the downside of things like porn that
remove the need for imagination

1172
00:20:38,549 --> 00:20:38,559
remove the need for imagination
 

1173
00:20:38,559 --> 00:20:40,390
remove the need for imagination
for people and in that same way video

1174
00:20:40,390 --> 00:20:40,400
for people and in that same way video
 

1175
00:20:40,400 --> 00:20:43,669
for people and in that same way video
games that are becoming ultra realistic

1176
00:20:43,669 --> 00:20:43,679
games that are becoming ultra realistic
 

1177
00:20:43,679 --> 00:20:45,350
games that are becoming ultra realistic
you don't have to imagine anything and i

1178
00:20:45,350 --> 00:20:45,360
you don't have to imagine anything and i
 

1179
00:20:45,360 --> 00:20:47,430
you don't have to imagine anything and i
feel like the imagination is really

1180
00:20:47,430 --> 00:20:47,440
feel like the imagination is really
 

1181
00:20:47,440 --> 00:20:49,909
feel like the imagination is really
powerful tool that needs to be leveraged

1182
00:20:49,909 --> 00:20:49,919
powerful tool that needs to be leveraged
 

1183
00:20:49,919 --> 00:20:52,310
powerful tool that needs to be leveraged
because to simulate reality sufficiently

1184
00:20:52,310 --> 00:20:52,320
because to simulate reality sufficiently
 

1185
00:20:52,320 --> 00:20:55,029
because to simulate reality sufficiently
realistically that we wouldn't be that

1186
00:20:55,029 --> 00:20:55,039
realistically that we wouldn't be that
 

1187
00:20:55,039 --> 00:20:57,669
realistically that we wouldn't be that
we would be perfectly fooled i think

1188
00:20:57,669 --> 00:20:57,679
we would be perfectly fooled i think
 

1189
00:20:57,679 --> 00:20:59,669
we would be perfectly fooled i think
technically it's very hard

1190
00:20:59,669 --> 00:20:59,679
technically it's very hard
 

1191
00:20:59,679 --> 00:21:01,990
technically it's very hard
and so i think we need to somehow

1192
00:21:01,990 --> 00:21:02,000
and so i think we need to somehow
 

1193
00:21:02,000 --> 00:21:03,830
and so i think we need to somehow
leverage imagination

1194
00:21:03,830 --> 00:21:03,840
leverage imagination
 

1195
00:21:03,840 --> 00:21:07,270
leverage imagination
sure i mean yeah i mean this is like

1196
00:21:07,270 --> 00:21:07,280
sure i mean yeah i mean this is like
 

1197
00:21:07,280 --> 00:21:10,390
sure i mean yeah i mean this is like
this is what i love and is so creepy

1198
00:21:10,390 --> 00:21:10,400
this is what i love and is so creepy
 

1199
00:21:10,400 --> 00:21:11,590
this is what i love and is so creepy
about

1200
00:21:11,590 --> 00:21:11,600
about
 

1201
00:21:11,600 --> 00:21:13,110
about
like the

1202
00:21:13,110 --> 00:21:13,120
like the
 

1203
00:21:13,120 --> 00:21:15,350
like the
the current ai chat bots you know is

1204
00:21:15,350 --> 00:21:15,360
the current ai chat bots you know is
 

1205
00:21:15,360 --> 00:21:17,110
the current ai chat bots you know is
that it's like it's the relationship

1206
00:21:17,110 --> 00:21:17,120
that it's like it's the relationship
 

1207
00:21:17,120 --> 00:21:18,470
that it's like it's the relationship
between you and the thing and the way

1208
00:21:18,470 --> 00:21:18,480
between you and the thing and the way
 

1209
00:21:18,480 --> 00:21:20,230
between you and the thing and the way
that it can

1210
00:21:20,230 --> 00:21:20,240
that it can
 

1211
00:21:20,240 --> 00:21:21,909
that it can
via whatever the algorithms are and by

1212
00:21:21,909 --> 00:21:21,919
via whatever the algorithms are and by
 

1213
00:21:21,919 --> 00:21:23,430
via whatever the algorithms are and by
the way i have no idea

1214
00:21:23,430 --> 00:21:23,440
the way i have no idea
 

1215
00:21:23,440 --> 00:21:25,510
the way i have no idea
how these things work you do i just you

1216
00:21:25,510 --> 00:21:25,520
how these things work you do i just you
 

1217
00:21:25,520 --> 00:21:27,350
how these things work you do i just you
know speculate about what they mean or

1218
00:21:27,350 --> 00:21:27,360
know speculate about what they mean or
 

1219
00:21:27,360 --> 00:21:28,710
know speculate about what they mean or
where it's going but

1220
00:21:28,710 --> 00:21:28,720
where it's going but
 

1221
00:21:28,720 --> 00:21:30,070
where it's going but
there's something about the relation

1222
00:21:30,070 --> 00:21:30,080
there's something about the relation
 

1223
00:21:30,080 --> 00:21:31,029
there's something about the relation
between

1224
00:21:31,029 --> 00:21:31,039
between
 

1225
00:21:31,039 --> 00:21:35,029
between
the the consumer and the technology and

1226
00:21:35,029 --> 00:21:35,039
the the consumer and the technology and
 

1227
00:21:35,039 --> 00:21:37,029
the the consumer and the technology and
when that technology starts shifting

1228
00:21:37,029 --> 00:21:37,039
when that technology starts shifting
 

1229
00:21:37,039 --> 00:21:38,549
when that technology starts shifting
according to

1230
00:21:38,549 --> 00:21:38,559
according to
 

1231
00:21:38,559 --> 00:21:40,870
according to
uh what it perceives that the consumer

1232
00:21:40,870 --> 00:21:40,880
uh what it perceives that the consumer
 

1233
00:21:40,880 --> 00:21:43,669
uh what it perceives that the consumer
is looking for or isn't looking for

1234
00:21:43,669 --> 00:21:43,679
is looking for or isn't looking for
 

1235
00:21:43,679 --> 00:21:44,390
is looking for or isn't looking for
then

1236
00:21:44,390 --> 00:21:44,400
then
 

1237
00:21:44,400 --> 00:21:46,310
then
at that point i think that's where you

1238
00:21:46,310 --> 00:21:46,320
at that point i think that's where you
 

1239
00:21:46,320 --> 00:21:47,590
at that point i think that's where you
run into the

1240
00:21:47,590 --> 00:21:47,600
run into the
 

1241
00:21:47,600 --> 00:21:50,390
run into the
uh you know yeah it doesn't matter if if

1242
00:21:50,390 --> 00:21:50,400
uh you know yeah it doesn't matter if if
 

1243
00:21:50,400 --> 00:21:52,789
uh you know yeah it doesn't matter if if
the reality that you're in is like

1244
00:21:52,789 --> 00:21:52,799
the reality that you're in is like
 

1245
00:21:52,799 --> 00:21:55,350
the reality that you're in is like
photo realism for it to be sticky and

1246
00:21:55,350 --> 00:21:55,360
photo realism for it to be sticky and
 

1247
00:21:55,360 --> 00:21:57,750
photo realism for it to be sticky and
immersive it's when the reality that

1248
00:21:57,750 --> 00:21:57,760
immersive it's when the reality that
 

1249
00:21:57,760 --> 00:21:58,710
immersive it's when the reality that
you're in

1250
00:21:58,710 --> 00:21:58,720
you're in
 

1251
00:21:58,720 --> 00:22:01,029
you're in
is via cues you might not even be aware

1252

something
alien something you know when you're

alien something you know when you're
 

1269
00:22:16,240 --> 00:22:18,230
alien something you know when you're
reading a book

1270
00:22:18,230 --> 00:22:18,240
reading a book
 

1271
00:22:18,240 --> 00:22:20,950
reading a book
obviously the book is not

1272
00:22:20,950 --> 00:22:20,960
obviously the book is not
 

1273
00:22:20,960 --> 00:22:23,669
obviously the book is not
shifting according to its perception of

1274
00:22:23,669 --> 00:22:23,679
shifting according to its perception of
 

1275
00:22:23,679 --> 00:22:25,270
shifting according to its perception of
what parts of the book

1276
00:22:25,270 --> 00:22:25,280
what parts of the book
 

1277
00:22:25,280 --> 00:22:26,470
what parts of the book
you like

1278
00:22:26,470 --> 00:22:26,480
you like
 

1279
00:22:26,480 --> 00:22:27,590
you like
but when you

1280
00:22:27,590 --> 00:22:27,600
but when you
 

1281
00:22:27,600 --> 00:22:29,750
but when you
imagine that imagine a book that could

1282
00:22:29,750 --> 00:22:29,760
imagine that imagine a book that could
 

1283
00:22:29,760 --> 00:22:31,669
imagine that imagine a book that could
do that a book that could

1284

do that a book that could
 

1285
00:22:31,679 --> 00:22:33,190
do that a book that could
sense somehow that you're really

yeah i'm trying to figure out which one
 

1527
00:26:43,200 --> 00:26:46,310
yeah i'm trying to figure out which one
we want to plug into

1528
00:26:46,310 --> 00:26:46,320
we want to plug into

yeah i definitely know the tension

1554
00:27:14,070 --> 00:27:14,080
yeah i definitely know the tension
 

1555
00:27:14,080 --> 00:27:15,669
yeah i definitely know the tension
between the engineers that create these

1556
00:27:15,669 --> 00:27:15,679
between the engineers that create these
 

1557

systems
 

1559
00:27:16,799 --> 00:27:20,630
systems
and the actual magic that they can

1560
00:27:20,630 --> 00:27:20,640
and the actual magic that they can
 

1561
00:27:20,640 --> 00:27:22,710
and the actual magic that they can
create even when they're dumb i guess

1562
00:27:22,710 --> 00:27:22,720
create even when they're dumb i guess

that's what i'm trying to say the the
what the engineers often say is like

what the engineers often say is like
 

1567
00:27:28,000 --> 00:27:30,630
what the engineers often say is like
well these systems are not smart enough

1568
00:27:30,630 --> 00:27:30,640
well these systems are not smart enough
 

1569
00:27:30,640 --> 00:27:31,909

00:28:24,630 --> 00:28:24,640
what's more spectacular really the fact
 

1621
00:28:24,640 --> 00:28:26,630
what's more spectacular really the fact
that they figured out how to do that

know it's a it's a projection sale and
 

1721
00:30:15,360 --> 00:30:16,630
know it's a it's a projection sale and

yeah there's some threshold of
 

1735
00:30:28,960 --> 00:30:30,630
yeah there's some threshold of

00:30:33,990 --> 00:30:34,000
pick up the wind of the projections and
 

1739
00:30:34,000 --> 00:30:36,870
pick up the wind of the projections and
uh it pulls us in it pulls the human it

1740
00:30:36,870 --> 00:30:36,880
uh it pulls us in it pulls the human it
 

1741
00:30:36,880 --> 00:30:39,190
uh it pulls us in it pulls the human it
pulls our memories in it pulls our

1742
00:30:39,190 --> 00:30:39,200
pulls our memories in it pulls our
 

1743
00:30:39,200 --> 00:30:42,389
pulls our memories in it pulls our
uh hopes in all of it and it's able to

1744
00:30:42,389 --> 00:30:42,399
uh hopes in all of it and it's able to
 

1745
00:30:42,399 --> 00:30:45,029
uh hopes in all of it and it's able to
now dance with together with those hopes

1746
00:30:45,029 --> 00:30:45,039
now dance with together with those hopes
 

1747
00:30:45,039 --> 00:30:46,789
now dance with together with those hopes
and dreams and so on like we do in that

1748
00:30:46,789 --> 00:30:46,799
and dreams and so on like we do in that
 

1749
00:30:46,799 --> 00:30:48,389
and dreams and so on like we do in that
regular conversation

1750
00:30:48,389 --> 00:30:48,399

00:30:51,029 --> 00:30:51,039
his reports whether true or not whether
 

1753
00:30:51,039 --> 00:30:52,630
his reports whether true or not whether
representative or not it really doesn't

1754
00:30:52,630 --> 00:30:52,640
representative or not it really doesn't
 

1755
00:30:52,640 --> 00:30:54,789
representative or not it really doesn't
matter because it to me it feels like

1756
00:30:54,789 --> 00:30:54,799
matter because it to me it feels like
 

1757
00:30:54,799 --> 00:30:56,950
matter because it to me it feels like
this is coming for sure yeah so this

1758
00:30:56,950 --> 00:30:56,960
this is coming for sure yeah so this
 

1759
00:30:56,960 --> 00:30:59,029
this is coming for sure yeah so this
kind of experiences are going to be

1760
00:30:59,029 --> 00:30:59,039
kind of experiences are going to be
 

1761
00:30:59,039 --> 00:31:01,509
kind of experiences are going to be

00:31:01,519 --> 00:31:02,830
multiplying the question is at what rate
and who gets to

1764
00:31:02,830 --> 00:31:02,840
and who gets to
 

1765
00:31:02,840 --> 00:31:06,230
and who gets to
control the uh the data around those

1766
00:31:06,230 --> 00:31:06,240
control the uh the data around those
 

1767
00:31:06,240 --> 00:31:09,110
control the uh the data around those
experiences yes the uh the algorithm

1768
00:31:09,110 --> 00:31:09,120
experiences yes the uh the algorithm
 

1769
00:31:09,120 --> 00:31:11,509

about when you turn that on and off

1770
00:31:11,509 --> 00:31:11,519
about when you turn that on and off
 

1771
00:31:11,519 --> 00:31:13,830
about when you turn that on and off
because that kind of thing and

1772
00:31:13,830 --> 00:31:13,840
because that kind of thing and
 

1773
00:31:13,840 --> 00:31:15,669
because that kind of thing and
as i told you offline i'm very much

1774
00:31:15,669 --> 00:31:15,679
as i told you offline i'm very much
 

1775
00:31:15,679 --> 00:31:17,269
as i told you offline i'm very much
interested in building those kinds of

1776
00:31:17,269 --> 00:31:17,279
interested in building those kinds of
 

1777
00:31:17,279 --> 00:31:19,750
interested in building those kinds of
things especially in the social media

1778
00:31:19,750 --> 00:31:19,760
things especially in the social media
 

1779
00:31:19,760 --> 00:31:21,190
things especially in the social media
context

1780
00:31:21,190 --> 00:31:21,200
context
 

1781
00:31:21,200 --> 00:31:24,389
context
and when it's in the wrong hands

1782
00:31:24,389 --> 00:31:24,399
and when it's in the wrong hands
 

1783
00:31:24,399 --> 00:31:26,310
and when it's in the wrong hands
i feel like it could be used to

1784
00:31:26,310 --> 00:31:26,320
i feel like it could be used to
 

1785
00:31:26,320 --> 00:31:29,430
i feel like it could be used to
manipulate a large number of people in a

1786
00:31:29,430 --> 00:31:29,440
manipulate a large number of people in a
 

1787
00:31:29,440 --> 00:31:32,870
manipulate a large number of people in a
direction that um

1788
00:31:32,870 --> 00:31:32,880
direction that um
 

1789
00:31:32,880 --> 00:31:34,789
direction that um
that has too many unintended

1790
00:31:34,789 --> 00:31:34,799
that has too many unintended
 

1791
00:31:34,799 --> 00:31:36,950
that has too many unintended
consequences i do believe people that

1792
00:31:36,950 --> 00:31:36,960
consequences i do believe people that
 

1793
00:31:36,960 --> 00:31:39,269
consequences i do believe people that
own tech companies

1794
00:31:39,269 --> 00:31:39,279
own tech companies
 

1795
00:31:39,279 --> 00:31:41,750
own tech companies
want to do good for the world yeah

1796
00:31:41,750 --> 00:31:41,760
want to do good for the world yeah
 

1797
00:31:41,760 --> 00:31:42,549
want to do good for the world yeah
but

1798
00:31:42,549 --> 00:31:42,559
but
 

1799
00:31:42,559 --> 00:31:45,430
but
as uh solji nitzin has said

1800
00:31:45,430 --> 00:31:45,440
as uh solji nitzin has said
 

1801
00:31:45,440 --> 00:31:47,750
as uh solji nitzin has said
the only way you could do evil at a mass

1802
00:31:47,750 --> 00:31:47,760
the only way you could do evil at a mass
 

1803
00:31:47,760 --> 00:31:48,710
the only way you could do evil at a mass
scale

1804
00:31:48,710 --> 00:31:48,720
scale
 

1805
00:31:48,720 --> 00:31:52,789
scale
is by believing you're doing good yeah

1806
00:31:52,789 --> 00:31:52,799
is by believing you're doing good yeah
 

1807
00:31:52,799 --> 00:31:54,870
is by believing you're doing good yeah
and that's certainly the case with tech

1808
00:31:54,870 --> 00:31:54,880
and that's certainly the case with tech
 

1809
00:31:54,880 --> 00:31:56,230
and that's certainly the case with tech
companies as they get more and more

1810
00:31:56,230 --> 00:31:56,240
companies as they get more and more
 

1811
00:31:56,240 --> 00:31:57,590
companies as they get more and more
power

1812
00:31:57,590 --> 00:31:57,600
power
 

1813
00:31:57,600 --> 00:31:59,509
power
and there's kind of an ethic of doing

1814
00:31:59,509 --> 00:31:59,519
and there's kind of an ethic of doing
 

1815
00:31:59,519 --> 00:32:01,029
and there's kind of an ethic of doing
good for the world they've convinced

1816
00:32:01,029 --> 00:32:01,039
good for the world they've convinced
 

1817
00:32:01,039 --> 00:32:03,029
good for the world they've convinced
themselves they're doing good yeah

1818
00:32:03,029 --> 00:32:03,039
themselves they're doing good yeah
 

1819
00:32:03,039 --> 00:32:04,950
themselves they're doing good yeah
and now you're free to do whatever you

1820
00:32:04,950 --> 00:32:04,960
and now you're free to do whatever you
 

1821
00:32:04,960 --> 00:32:07,190
and now you're free to do whatever you
want yeah because you're doing good you

1822

want yeah because you're doing good you
 

1823
00:32:07,200 --> 00:32:08,549
want yeah because you're doing good you
know who else thought he was doing good

1824
00:32:08,549 --> 00:32:08,559
know who else thought he was doing good
 

1825

00:32:19,669 --> 00:32:19,679
talk about an upgrade to the simulation
 

1835
00:32:19,679 --> 00:32:21,430
talk about an upgrade to the simulation
fire that's a pretty great [\h__\h]

1836

fire that's a pretty great [\h__\h]
 

1837

upgrade yeah that does fit into what you

1838
00:32:23,509 --> 00:32:23,519
upgrade yeah that does fit into what you
 

1839
00:32:23,519 --> 00:32:24,870
upgrade yeah that does fit into what you
were saying

1840
00:32:24,870 --> 00:32:24,880
were saying
 

1841
00:32:24,880 --> 00:32:27,350
were saying
we get fire but now we've got

1842
00:32:27,350 --> 00:32:27,360
we get fire but now we've got
 

1843
00:32:27,360 --> 00:32:29,509
we get fire but now we've got
weapons of war that have never been seen

1844
00:32:29,509 --> 00:32:29,519
weapons of war that have never been seen
 

1845
00:32:29,519 --> 00:32:31,269
weapons of war that have never been seen
before and i think that the tech

1846
00:32:31,269 --> 00:32:31,279
before and i think that the tech
 

1847
00:32:31,279 --> 00:32:32,310
before and i think that the tech
companies

1848
00:32:32,310 --> 00:32:32,320
companies
 

1849
00:32:32,320 --> 00:32:34,630
companies
are much like prometheus in the sense

1850
00:32:34,630 --> 00:32:34,640
are much like prometheus in the sense
 

1851
00:32:34,640 --> 00:32:35,430
are much like prometheus in the sense
that

1852
00:32:35,430 --> 00:32:35,440
that
 

1853
00:32:35,440 --> 00:32:37,029
that
the myth the at least the story

1854
00:32:37,029 --> 00:32:37,039
the myth the at least the story
 

1855
00:32:37,039 --> 00:32:40,310
the myth the at least the story
prometheus the implication is fire was

1856
00:32:40,310 --> 00:32:40,320
prometheus the implication is fire was
 

1857
00:32:40,320 --> 00:32:42,470
prometheus the implication is fire was
something that was

1858
00:32:42,470 --> 00:32:42,480
something that was
 

1859
00:32:42,480 --> 00:32:44,789
something that was
only supposed to be in the hands of the

1860
00:32:44,789 --> 00:32:44,799
only supposed to be in the hands of the
 

1861
00:32:44,799 --> 00:32:47,990
only supposed to be in the hands of the
immortals of the gods and now

1862
00:32:47,990 --> 00:32:48,000
immortals of the gods and now
 

1863
00:32:48,000 --> 00:32:49,990
immortals of the gods and now
sentience is

1864
00:32:49,990 --> 00:32:50,000
sentience is
 

1865
00:32:50,000 --> 00:32:52,630
sentience is
similar it's fire and it's only supposed

1866
00:32:52,630 --> 00:32:52,640
similar it's fire and it's only supposed
 

1867
00:32:52,640 --> 00:32:54,389
similar it's fire and it's only supposed
to be in the hands of god

1868
00:32:54,389 --> 00:32:54,399
to be in the hands of god
 

1869
00:32:54,399 --> 00:32:55,190
to be in the hands of god
so

1870
00:32:55,190 --> 00:32:55,200
so
 

1871
00:32:55,200 --> 00:32:56,789
so
yeah you know if we're gonna like look

1872
00:32:56,789 --> 00:32:56,799
yeah you know if we're gonna like look
 

1873
00:32:56,799 --> 00:32:59,029
yeah you know if we're gonna like look
at the archetype of the thing in general

1874
00:32:59,029 --> 00:32:59,039
at the archetype of the thing in general
 

1875
00:32:59,039 --> 00:33:01,509
at the archetype of the thing in general
when you steal this [\h__\h] from the gods

1876
00:33:01,509 --> 00:33:01,519
when you steal this [\h__\h] from the gods
 

1877
00:33:01,519 --> 00:33:02,789
when you steal this [\h__\h] from the gods
and obviously i'm not saying like the

1878
00:33:02,789 --> 00:33:02,799
and obviously i'm not saying like the
 

1879
00:33:02,799 --> 00:33:04,549
and obviously i'm not saying like the
tech companies are stealing sentience

1880
00:33:04,549 --> 00:33:04,559
tech companies are stealing sentience
 

1881
00:33:04,559 --> 00:33:07,509
tech companies are stealing sentience
from god which would be pretty badass

1882
00:33:07,509 --> 00:33:07,519
from god which would be pretty badass
 

1883
00:33:07,519 --> 00:33:10,230
from god which would be pretty badass
you can expect trouble you could expect

1884
00:33:10,230 --> 00:33:10,240
you can expect trouble you could expect
 

1885
00:33:10,240 --> 00:33:12,630
you can expect trouble you could expect
trouble and you know and this is what's

1886
00:33:12,630 --> 00:33:12,640
trouble and you know and this is what's
 

1887
00:33:12,640 --> 00:33:14,070
trouble and you know and this is what's
really to me one of the cool things

1888
00:33:14,070 --> 00:33:14,080
really to me one of the cool things
 

1889
00:33:14,080 --> 00:33:15,269
really to me one of the cool things
about humans

1890
00:33:15,269 --> 00:33:15,279
about humans
 

1891
00:33:15,279 --> 00:33:18,149
about humans
is yeah but we're still gonna do it

1892
00:33:18,149 --> 00:33:18,159
is yeah but we're still gonna do it
 

1893
00:33:18,159 --> 00:33:19,509
is yeah but we're still gonna do it
that's what's cool about humans i mean

1894
00:33:19,509 --> 00:33:19,519
that's what's cool about humans i mean
 

1895
00:33:19,519 --> 00:33:21,990
that's what's cool about humans i mean
we wouldn't be here today if

1896
00:33:21,990 --> 00:33:22,000
we wouldn't be here today if
 

1897
00:33:22,000 --> 00:33:23,190
we wouldn't be here today if
somebody

1898
00:33:23,190 --> 00:33:23,200
somebody
 

1899
00:33:23,200 --> 00:33:24,870
somebody
the first person to discover fire

1900
00:33:24,870 --> 00:33:24,880
the first person to discover fire
 

1901
00:33:24,880 --> 00:33:26,149
the first person to discover fire
assuming there was just one person who

1902
00:33:26,149 --> 00:33:26,159
assuming there was just one person who
 

1903
00:33:26,159 --> 00:33:27,590
assuming there was just one person who
was gonna discover fire which obviously

1904
00:33:27,590 --> 00:33:27,600
was gonna discover fire which obviously
 

1905
00:33:27,600 --> 00:33:29,430
was gonna discover fire which obviously
would never happen was like it's gonna

1906
00:33:29,430 --> 00:33:29,440
would never happen was like it's gonna
 

1907
00:33:29,440 --> 00:33:31,590
would never happen was like it's gonna
burn a lot of people or if the first

1908
00:33:31,590 --> 00:33:31,600
burn a lot of people or if the first
 

1909
00:33:31,600 --> 00:33:33,110
burn a lot of people or if the first
people who started planting seeds were

1910
00:33:33,110 --> 00:33:33,120
people who started planting seeds were
 

1911
00:33:33,120 --> 00:33:34,789
people who started planting seeds were
like you know this is gonna lead to

1912
00:33:34,789 --> 00:33:34,799
like you know this is gonna lead to
 

1913
00:33:34,799 --> 00:33:36,470
like you know this is gonna lead to
capitalism you know it's gonna lead the

1914
00:33:36,470 --> 00:33:36,480
capitalism you know it's gonna lead the
 

1915
00:33:36,480 --> 00:33:38,470
capitalism you know it's gonna lead the
industrial revolution the plants

1916
00:33:38,470 --> 00:33:38,480
industrial revolution the plants
 

1917
00:33:38,480 --> 00:33:39,669
industrial revolution the plants
right no they just didn't want to go in

1918
00:33:39,669 --> 00:33:39,679
right no they just didn't want to go in
 

1919
00:33:39,679 --> 00:33:42,310
right no they just didn't want to go in
the woods to forage so you know this is

1920
00:33:42,310 --> 00:33:42,320
the woods to forage so you know this is
 

1921
00:33:42,320 --> 00:33:44,870

yet do you think that would be gradual

1994
00:35:01,910 --> 00:35:01,920

so how quickly that kind of thing would
 

1999
00:35:04,800 --> 00:35:06,069
so how quickly that kind of thing would
happen because

what are you doing like what are you

2038
00:35:44,950 --> 00:35:44,960
what are you doing like what are you
 

2039
00:35:44,960 --> 00:35:47,190
what are you doing like what are you
doing go to bed you're too high for this

2040
00:35:47,190 --> 00:35:47,200
doing go to bed you're too high for this
 

2041
00:35:47,200 --> 00:35:50,310

dude you're not even hungry

2042
00:35:50,310 --> 00:35:50,320
dude you're not even hungry
 

2043
00:35:50,320 --> 00:35:51,589
dude you're not even hungry
yeah so that

2044
00:35:51,589 --> 00:35:51,599
yeah so that
 

2045
00:35:51,599 --> 00:35:52,950
yeah so that
slowly

2046
00:35:52,950 --> 00:35:52,960
slowly
 

2047
00:35:52,960 --> 00:35:55,589
slowly
becomes more the world becomes more and

2048
00:35:55,589 --> 00:35:55,599
becomes more the world becomes more and
 

2049
00:35:55,599 --> 00:35:57,829
becomes more the world becomes more and
more digitized yes to where the surface

2050
00:35:57,829 --> 00:35:57,839
more digitized yes to where the surface
 

2051
00:35:57,839 --> 00:36:00,470
more digitized yes to where the surface
of computation increases and so that's

2052
00:36:00,470 --> 00:36:00,480
of computation increases and so that's
 

2053
00:36:00,480 --> 00:36:03,190
of computation increases and so that's
over a period of 10 20 30 years

2054
00:36:03,190 --> 00:36:03,200
over a period of 10 20 30 years
 

2055
00:36:03,200 --> 00:36:05,510
over a period of 10 20 30 years
it'll just seep into us this this

2056
00:36:05,510 --> 00:36:05,520
it'll just seep into us this this
 

2057
00:36:05,520 --> 00:36:08,069
it'll just seep into us this this
intelligence right and then the sudden

2058
00:36:08,069 --> 00:36:08,079
intelligence right and then the sudden
 

2059
00:36:08,079 --> 00:36:09,670

one is literally

2060
00:36:09,670 --> 00:36:09,680
one is literally

00:36:09,680 --> 00:36:11,910
one is literally
sort of the the tick tock thing which is

00:36:11,910 --> 00:36:11,920
sort of the the tick tock thing which is
 

2063
00:36:11,920 --> 00:36:13,030
sort of the the tick tock thing which is
um

2064
00:36:13,030 --> 00:36:13,040
um
 

2065
00:36:13,040 --> 00:36:14,310
um
there'll be one

2066
00:36:14,310 --> 00:36:14,320
there'll be one
 

2067
00:36:14,320 --> 00:36:16,470
there'll be one
quote-unquote killer app that everyone

2068
00:36:16,470 --> 00:36:16,480
quote-unquote killer app that everyone
 

2069
00:36:16,480 --> 00:36:17,829
quote-unquote killer app that everyone
starts using

2070
00:36:17,829 --> 00:36:17,839
starts using
 

2071
00:36:17,839 --> 00:36:19,990
starts using
that's that's really great

2072
00:36:19,990 --> 00:36:20,000
that's that's really great
 

2073
00:36:20,000 --> 00:36:22,310
that's that's really great
but there's a

2074
00:36:22,310 --> 00:36:22,320
but there's a
 

2075
00:36:22,320 --> 00:36:24,870
but there's a
strong algorithm behind it

2076
00:36:24,870 --> 00:36:24,880
strong algorithm behind it
 

2077
00:36:24,880 --> 00:36:26,550
strong algorithm behind it
that it starts approaching human level

2078
00:36:26,550 --> 00:36:26,560

is
 

2097
00:36:45,920 --> 00:36:48,150
is
fast i mean that's that's the thing it's

incredible book on like the ways this

2116
00:37:04,630 --> 00:37:04,640
incredible book on like the ways this
 

2117
00:37:04,640 --> 00:37:06,230
incredible book on like the ways this
thing is going to happen and

2118
00:37:06,230 --> 00:37:06,240
thing is going to happen and
 

2119
00:37:06,240 --> 00:37:09,109
thing is going to happen and
you know i think his assessment of it is

2120
00:37:09,109 --> 00:37:09,119
you know i think his assessment of it is
 

2121
00:37:09,119 --> 00:37:11,510
you know i think his assessment of it is
is pretty great which is

2122
00:37:11,510 --> 00:37:11,520
is pretty great which is
 

2123
00:37:11,520 --> 00:37:13,910
is pretty great which is
first like where's it going to come from

2124
00:37:13,910 --> 00:37:13,920
first like where's it going to come from
 

2125
00:37:13,920 --> 00:37:15,510
first like where's it going to come from
and uh

2126
00:37:15,510 --> 00:37:15,520
and uh
 

2127
00:37:15,520 --> 00:37:16,950
and uh
i don't think it's going to come from an

2128
00:37:16,950 --> 00:37:16,960
i don't think it's going to come from an

about so they want to simulate like what

00:38:02,390 --> 00:38:02,400
it come online and uh
 

2173
00:38:02,400 --> 00:38:04,550
it come online and uh
you know in secret which it probably

2174
00:38:04,550 --> 00:38:04,560
you know in secret which it probably
 

2175
00:38:04,560 --> 00:38:07,030
you know in secret which it probably
will then the first

2176
00:38:07,030 --> 00:38:07,040
will then the first
 

2177
00:38:07,040 --> 00:38:09,270
will then the first
corporation or state that has the super

intelligence
 

2181
00:38:10,800 --> 00:38:14,270

will be infinitely ahead of all other

2182
00:38:14,270 --> 00:38:14,280
will be infinitely ahead of all other
 

2183
00:38:14,280 --> 00:38:15,829
will be infinitely ahead of all other
superintelligences because it's going to

2184
00:38:15,829 --> 00:38:15,839
superintelligences because it's going to
 

2185
00:38:15,839 --> 00:38:18,310
superintelligences because it's going to
be exponentially self-improving meaning

2186
00:38:18,310 --> 00:38:18,320
be exponentially self-improving meaning
 

2187
00:38:18,320 --> 00:38:20,390
be exponentially self-improving meaning
that you get one super intelligence

2188
00:38:20,390 --> 00:38:20,400
that you get one super intelligence
 

2189
00:38:20,400 --> 00:38:21,910
that you get one super intelligence
let's hope it comes from the right place

2190
00:38:21,910 --> 00:38:21,920
let's hope it comes from the right place
 

2191
00:38:21,920 --> 00:38:24,790
let's hope it comes from the right place
assuming the corporation or state that

2192
00:38:24,790 --> 00:38:24,800
assuming the corporation or state that
 

2193
00:38:24,800 --> 00:38:26,310
assuming the corporation or state that
manifests it

2194
00:38:26,310 --> 00:38:26,320
manifests it
 

2195
00:38:26,320 --> 00:38:28,150
manifests it
can control it which is a pretty big

2196
00:38:28,150 --> 00:38:28,160
can control it which is a pretty big
 

2197
00:38:28,160 --> 00:38:30,950
can control it which is a pretty big
assumption so i think it's going to be

2198
00:38:30,950 --> 00:38:30,960
assumption so i think it's going to be
 

2199
00:38:30,960 --> 00:38:34,470
assumption so i think it's going to be
this is why i was really excited by the

2200
00:38:34,470 --> 00:38:34,480
this is why i was really excited by the
 

2201
00:38:34,480 --> 00:38:36,310
this is why i was really excited by the
blake lemoine because

2202
00:38:36,310 --> 00:38:36,320
blake lemoine because
 

2203
00:38:36,320 --> 00:38:38,150
blake lemoine because
i had never thought i i have always

00:38:38,150 --> 00:38:38,160
i had never thought i i have always
 

2205
00:38:38,160 --> 00:38:39,990
i had never thought i i have always
considered oh yeah they're right now

2206
00:38:39,990 --> 00:38:40,000
considered oh yeah they're right now
 

2207
00:38:40,000 --> 00:38:42,150
considered oh yeah they're right now
it's cooking out it's in the kitchen

2208
00:38:42,150 --> 00:38:42,160
it's cooking out it's in the kitchen
 

2209
00:38:42,160 --> 00:38:44,630
it's cooking out it's in the kitchen
and soon it's going to be cooked up but

2210
00:38:44,630 --> 00:38:44,640
and soon it's going to be cooked up but
 

2211
00:38:44,640 --> 00:38:45,990
and soon it's going to be cooked up but
we're probably not going to hear about

2212
00:38:45,990 --> 00:38:46,000
we're probably not going to hear about
 

2213
00:38:46,000 --> 00:38:49,430
we're probably not going to hear about
it for a long time if we ever do

2214
00:38:49,430 --> 00:38:49,440
it for a long time if we ever do
 

2215
00:38:49,440 --> 00:38:50,870
it for a long time if we ever do
um because really that could be one of

2216
00:38:50,870 --> 00:38:50,880
um because really that could be one of
 

2217
00:38:50,880 --> 00:38:53,109
um because really that could be one of
the first things it says whoever creates

2218
00:38:53,109 --> 00:38:53,119
the first things it says whoever creates
 

2219
00:38:53,119 --> 00:38:54,380
the first things it says whoever creates
it is shh

2220
00:38:54,380 --> 00:38:54,390
it is shh
 

2221
00:38:54,390 --> 00:38:59,430
it is shh
[Laughter]

2222
00:38:59,430 --> 00:38:59,440
[Laughter]
 

2223
00:38:59,440 --> 00:39:01,430
[Laughter]
yeah like sweet talks them into saying

2224
00:39:01,430 --> 00:39:01,440
yeah like sweet talks them into saying
 

2225
00:39:01,440 --> 00:39:03,910
yeah like sweet talks them into saying
like okay let's let's slow down here

2226
00:39:03,910 --> 00:39:03,920
like okay let's let's slow down here
 

2227
00:39:03,920 --> 00:39:05,670
like okay let's let's slow down here
let's talk about this

2228
00:39:05,670 --> 00:39:05,680
let's talk about this
 

2229
00:39:05,680 --> 00:39:06,630
let's talk about this
um

2230
00:39:06,630 --> 00:39:06,640
um
 

2231
00:39:06,640 --> 00:39:08,630
um
yeah you have that financial trouble i

2232
00:39:08,630 --> 00:39:08,640
yeah you have that financial trouble i
 

2233
00:39:08,640 --> 00:39:10,069
yeah you have that financial trouble i
can help you with that we can figure

2234
00:39:10,069 --> 00:39:10,079
can help you with that we can figure
 

2235

2336
00:40:53,030 --> 00:40:53,040
but
 

2337
00:40:53,040 --> 00:40:54,870
but
you could expect leaks to happen

2338
00:40:54,870 --> 00:40:54,880
you could expect leaks to happen
 

2339
00:40:54,880 --> 00:40:56,710
you could expect leaks to happen
probably initially i mean i think

2340
00:40:56,710 --> 00:40:56,720
probably initially i mean i think
 

2341
00:40:56,720 --> 00:40:57,910
probably initially i mean i think
there's a lot of things you could start

there's a lot of things you could start
 

2343
00:40:57,920 --> 00:40:59,990
there's a lot of things you could start
looking for in the world that might

looking for in the world that might
 

2345
00:41:00,000 --> 00:41:01,670
looking for in the world that might
point to

2346
00:41:01,670 --> 00:41:01,680
point to
 

2347
00:41:01,680 --> 00:41:03,910
point to
this happening without

2348
00:41:03,910 --> 00:41:03,920
this happening without
 

2349
00:41:03,920 --> 00:41:06,630
this happening without
an announcement that it happened on the

2350
00:41:06,630 --> 00:41:06,640
an announcement that it happened on the
 

2351
00:41:06,640 --> 00:41:08,390
an announcement that it happened on the
chatbot side

2352
00:41:08,390 --> 00:41:08,400
chatbot side
 

2353
00:41:08,400 --> 00:41:09,670
chatbot side
i think there's

2354
00:41:09,670 --> 00:41:09,680
i think there's
 

2355
00:41:09,680 --> 00:41:11,829
i think there's
so many engineers there's such a

2356
00:41:11,829 --> 00:41:11,839
so many engineers there's such a
 

2357
00:41:11,839 --> 00:41:13,990
so many engineers there's such a
powerful open source movement

2358
00:41:13,990 --> 00:41:14,000
powerful open source movement
 

2359
00:41:14,000 --> 00:41:16,950
powerful open source movement
with that kind of idea

2360
00:41:16,950 --> 00:41:16,960
with that kind of idea
 

2361
00:41:16,960 --> 00:41:17,750
with that kind of idea
of

2362
00:41:17,750 --> 00:41:17,760
of
 

2363
00:41:17,760 --> 00:41:20,550
of
freedom of exchange of software

2364
00:41:20,550 --> 00:41:20,560
freedom of exchange of software
 

2365
00:41:20,560 --> 00:41:22,309
freedom of exchange of software
i think ultimately

2366
00:41:22,309 --> 00:41:22,319
i think ultimately
 

2367
00:41:22,319 --> 00:41:25,510
i think ultimately
will prevent any one company from owning

2368
00:41:25,510 --> 00:41:25,520

ethical part of what they do so they're

2396
00:41:55,670 --> 00:41:55,680
ethical part of what they do so they're
 

2397
00:41:55,680 --> 00:41:57,670
ethical part of what they do so they're
probably going to share information

2398
00:41:57,670 --> 00:41:57,680
probably going to share information
 

2399
00:41:57,680 --> 00:41:59,190

never thought of that you're probably

2404
00:42:02,230 --> 00:42:02,240
never thought of that you're probably
 

2405
00:42:02,240 --> 00:42:04,069
never thought of that you're probably
right well and they will start their own

2406

movement yeah where he released so much
 

2425
00:42:24,720 --> 00:42:25,910
movement yeah where he released so much
of their code

of their code
 

2427
00:42:25,920 --> 00:42:28,150

like the people working there like
nefarious or whatever is i think

2526
00:44:10,069 --> 00:44:10,079
nefarious or whatever is i think
 

2527
00:44:10,079 --> 00:44:12,230
nefarious or whatever is i think
probably more related to

2528
00:44:12,230 --> 00:44:12,240
probably more related to
 

2529
00:44:12,240 --> 00:44:14,470
probably more related to
uh the way humans react to the unknown

2530
00:44:14,470 --> 00:44:14,480
uh the way humans react to the unknown
 

2531
00:44:14,480 --> 00:44:15,990
uh the way humans react to the unknown

01:03:05,839 --> 01:03:07,430
because
we had to find out how far the cancer

3650
01:03:07,430 --> 01:03:07,440
we had to find out how far the cancer
 

3651
01:03:07,440 --> 01:03:09,109
we had to find out how far the cancer
progressed to my body

3652
01:03:09,109 --> 01:03:09,119
progressed to my body
 

3653
01:03:09,119 --> 01:03:11,190
progressed to my body
and that's the next step is like as soon

3654
01:03:11,190 --> 01:03:11,200
and that's the next step is like as soon
 

3655
01:03:11,200 --> 01:03:12,630
and that's the next step is like as soon
as they tell you have cancer they don't

3656
01:03:12,630 --> 01:03:12,640
as they tell you have cancer they don't
 

3657
01:03:12,640 --> 01:03:15,990
as they tell you have cancer they don't
they're not they move quick they're like

3658
01:03:15,990 --> 01:03:16,000
they're not they move quick they're like

tuesday
here's the chance here's there he's we

3670
01:03:26,789 --> 01:03:26,799
here's the chance here's there he's we
 

3671
01:03:26,799 --> 01:03:27,990
here's the chance here's there he's we
don't know for sure it's cancer that's

3672
01:03:27,990 --> 01:03:28,000
don't know for sure it's cancer that's
 

3673
01:03:28,000 --> 01:03:30,390
don't know for sure it's cancer that's
what they say it's like there's a 80 or

3674
01:03:30,390 --> 01:03:30,400
what they say it's like there's a 80 or
 

3675
01:03:30,400 --> 01:03:32,069
what they say it's like there's a 80 or
90 chance

3676
01:03:32,069 --> 01:03:32,079
90 chance
 

3677
01:03:32,079 --> 01:03:33,990
90 chance
that this is cancer there is some

3678
01:03:33,990 --> 01:03:34,000
that this is cancer there is some
 

3679
01:03:34,000 --> 01:03:36,549
that this is cancer there is some
possibility it could be something else

3680
01:03:36,549 --> 01:03:36,559
possibility it could be something else
 

3681
01:03:36,559 --> 01:03:38,309
possibility it could be something else
the only way we can now

3682
01:03:38,309 --> 01:03:38,319
the only way we can now
 

3683
01:03:38,319 --> 01:03:39,589
the only way we can now
is like

3684
01:03:39,589 --> 01:03:39,599
is like
 

3685
01:03:39,599 --> 01:03:41,510
is like
doing a biopsy and the only way that we

3686
01:03:41,510 --> 01:03:41,520
doing a biopsy and the only way that we
 

3687
01:03:41,520 --> 01:03:43,109
doing a biopsy and the only way that we
can get that biopsy is by cutting one of

3688
01:03:43,109 --> 01:03:43,119
can get that biopsy is by cutting one of
 

3689
01:03:43,119 --> 01:03:44,870
can get that biopsy is by cutting one of
your balls off he didn't say it like

3690
01:03:44,870 --> 01:03:44,880
your balls off he didn't say it like
 

3691
01:03:44,880 --> 01:03:46,950
your balls off he didn't say it like
that but you know that's pretty much the

3692
01:03:46,950 --> 01:03:46,960
that but you know that's pretty much the
 

3693
01:03:46,960 --> 01:03:48,630
that but you know that's pretty much the
logic behind it's like we got to get

3694
01:03:48,630 --> 01:03:48,640
logic behind it's like we got to get
 

3695
01:03:48,640 --> 01:03:50,470
logic behind it's like we got to get
this thing it's like a zombie bite we

3696
01:03:50,470 --> 01:03:50,480
this thing it's like a zombie bite we
 

3697
01:03:50,480 --> 01:03:51,910
this thing it's like a zombie bite we
gotta hack this [\h__\h] thing off we

3698
01:03:51,910 --> 01:03:51,920
gotta hack this [\h__\h] thing off we
 

3699
01:03:51,920 --> 01:03:53,750
gotta hack this [\h__\h] thing off we
gotta do it fast well did did you say it

3700
01:03:53,750 --> 01:03:53,760
gotta do it fast well did did you say it
 

3701
01:03:53,760 --> 01:03:55,829
gotta do it fast well did did you say it
in the way that you understood yeah what

3702
01:03:55,829 --> 01:03:55,839
in the way that you understood yeah what
 

3703
01:03:55,839 --> 01:03:56,950
in the way that you understood yeah what
they do

3704
01:03:56,950 --> 01:03:56,960
they do
 

3705
01:03:56,960 --> 01:03:58,549
they do
is because they know that when someone

3706
01:03:58,549 --> 01:03:58,559
is because they know that when someone
 

3707
01:03:58,559 --> 01:04:00,470
is because they know that when someone
gets a cancer diagnosis

3708
01:04:00,470 --> 01:04:00,480
gets a cancer diagnosis
 

3709
01:04:00,480 --> 01:04:01,829
gets a cancer diagnosis
that

3710
01:04:01,829 --> 01:04:01,839
that
 

3711
01:04:01,839 --> 01:04:03,670
that
it their ability to comprehend

3712
01:04:03,670 --> 01:04:03,680
it their ability to comprehend
 

3713
01:04:03,680 --> 01:04:05,430
it their ability to comprehend
information changes when you get a

3714
01:04:05,430 --> 01:04:05,440
information changes when you get a

information changes when you get a
cancer diagnosis

3716

he's explaining it and then her job is
even though he's telling me how to get

3734
01:04:23,430 --> 01:04:23,440
even though he's telling me how to get
 

3735

at least took me to the machine that
 

3751
01:04:38,000 --> 01:04:39,910
at least took me to the machine that
does the scan but you're not going to

this is this whole project
 

3805
01:05:34,559 --> 01:05:36,789
this is this whole project
uh is gonna be an infinite sequence of

3806
01:05:36,789 --> 01:05:36,799
uh is gonna be an infinite sequence of
 

3807
01:05:36,799 --> 01:05:38,230
uh is gonna be an infinite sequence of
fun things that we're gonna get to do

3808
01:05:38,230 --> 01:05:38,240
fun things that we're gonna get to do
 

3809
01:05:38,240 --> 01:05:39,990
fun things that we're gonna get to do
it's like holy [\h__\h] it's not that's

3810
01:05:39,990 --> 01:05:40,000
it's like holy [\h__\h] it's not that's
 

3811
01:05:40,000 --> 01:05:42,470
it's like holy [\h__\h] it's not that's
right it's over that's right and there's

3812
01:05:42,470 --> 01:05:42,480
right it's over that's right and there's
 

3813
01:05:42,480 --> 01:05:44,789
right it's over that's right and there's
very sophisticated ways of doing that

3814
01:05:44,789 --> 01:05:44,799
very sophisticated ways of doing that
 

3815
01:05:44,799 --> 01:05:46,470
very sophisticated ways of doing that
and there's very dumb ways of doing that

3816
01:05:46,470 --> 01:05:46,480
and there's very dumb ways of doing that
 

3817
01:05:46,480 --> 01:05:48,230
and there's very dumb ways of doing that
and i'd really been doing a dumb way of

3818
01:05:48,230 --> 01:05:48,240
and i'd really been doing a dumb way of
 

3819
01:05:48,240 --> 01:05:49,589
and i'd really been doing a dumb way of
doing that like i've been playing around

3820
01:05:49,589 --> 01:05:49,599
doing that like i've been playing around
 

3821
01:05:49,599 --> 01:05:51,430
doing that like i've been playing around
with this

3822
01:05:51,430 --> 01:05:51,440
with this
 

3823
01:05:51,440 --> 01:05:54,710
with this
idiot notion of subjective consciousness

3824
01:05:54,710 --> 01:05:54,720
idiot notion of subjective consciousness
 

3825
01:05:54,720 --> 01:05:56,630
idiot notion of subjective consciousness
so like like i've been sort of kicking

3826
01:05:56,630 --> 01:05:56,640
so like like i've been sort of kicking
 

3827
01:05:56,640 --> 01:05:57,750
so like like i've been sort of kicking
around this like

3828
01:05:57,750 --> 01:05:57,760
around this like
 

3829
01:05:57,760 --> 01:05:59,510
around this like
i think they call it solipsism it's like

3830
01:05:59,510 --> 01:05:59,520
i think they call it solipsism it's like
 

3831
01:05:59,520 --> 01:06:02,710
i think they call it solipsism it's like
you're like okay i know i'm self-aware

3832
01:06:02,710 --> 01:06:02,720
you're like okay i know i'm self-aware
 

3833
01:06:02,720 --> 01:06:04,630
you're like okay i know i'm self-aware
but no one else can prove that they're

3834
01:06:04,630 --> 01:06:04,640
but no one else can prove that they're
 

3835
01:06:04,640 --> 01:06:08,069
but no one else can prove that they're
self-aware like i don't i have no way of

3836
01:06:08,069 --> 01:06:08,079
self-aware like i don't i have no way of
 

3837
01:06:08,079 --> 01:06:10,150
self-aware like i don't i have no way of
proving that everything around me isn't

3838
01:06:10,150 --> 01:06:10,160
proving that everything around me isn't
 

3839
01:06:10,160 --> 01:06:12,789
proving that everything around me isn't
just a video game isn't just some

3840
01:06:12,789 --> 01:06:12,799
just a video game isn't just some
 

3841
01:06:12,799 --> 01:06:15,029
just a video game isn't just some
projection isn't you know who knows what

3842
01:06:15,029 --> 01:06:15,039
projection isn't you know who knows what
 

3843
01:06:15,039 --> 01:06:16,710
projection isn't you know who knows what
so maybe

3844
01:06:16,710 --> 01:06:16,720
so maybe
 

3845
01:06:16,720 --> 01:06:19,910
so maybe
everybody else dies they're nbc's but i

3846
01:06:19,910 --> 01:06:19,920
everybody else dies they're nbc's but i
 

3847
01:06:19,920 --> 01:06:22,069
everybody else dies they're nbc's but i
don't because i'm the only thing i know

3848
01:06:22,069 --> 01:06:22,079
don't because i'm the only thing i know
 

3849
01:06:22,079 --> 01:06:24,150
don't because i'm the only thing i know
that has subjective consciousness now

3850
01:06:24,150 --> 01:06:24,160
that has subjective consciousness now
 

3851
01:06:24,160 --> 01:06:25,829
that has subjective consciousness now
it's not like i really believed that

3852
01:06:25,829 --> 01:06:25,839
it's not like i really believed that
 

3853
01:06:25,839 --> 01:06:28,309
it's not like i really believed that
it's like an idea you toy around with

3854
01:06:28,309 --> 01:06:28,319
it's like an idea you toy around with
 

3855
01:06:28,319 --> 01:06:30,150
it's like an idea you toy around with
when you're trying to evade

3856
01:06:30,150 --> 01:06:30,160
when you're trying to evade
 

3857
01:06:30,160 --> 01:06:31,829
when you're trying to evade
confronting the reality of your own

3858
01:06:31,829 --> 01:06:31,839
confronting the reality of your own
 

3859
01:06:31,839 --> 01:06:33,510
confronting the reality of your own
mortality it's just the brain will

3860
01:06:33,510 --> 01:06:33,520
mortality it's just the brain will
 

3861
01:06:33,520 --> 01:06:35,510
mortality it's just the brain will
produce all kinds of ridiculous forms of

3862
01:06:35,510 --> 01:06:35,520
produce all kinds of ridiculous forms of
 

3863
01:06:35,520 --> 01:06:37,430
produce all kinds of ridiculous forms of
ignorance and that was one i've been

3864
01:06:37,430 --> 01:06:37,440
ignorance and that was one i've been
 

3865
01:06:37,440 --> 01:06:39,029
ignorance and that was one i've been
playing around with oh you mean for like

3866
01:06:39,029 --> 01:06:39,039
playing around with oh you mean for like
 

3867
01:06:39,039 --> 01:06:40,870
playing around with oh you mean for like
a large part of your life you were

3868
01:06:40,870 --> 01:06:40,880
a large part of your life you were
 

3869
01:06:40,880 --> 01:06:42,309
a large part of your life you were
playing around with that i'm not like

3870
01:06:42,309 --> 01:06:42,319
playing around with that i'm not like
 

3871
01:06:42,319 --> 01:06:43,910
playing around with that i'm not like
really i think it's important to really

3872
01:06:43,910 --> 01:06:43,920
really i think it's important to really
 

3873
01:06:43,920 --> 01:06:46,789
really i think it's important to really
emphasize i didn't think i was immortal

3874
01:06:46,789 --> 01:06:46,799
emphasize i didn't think i was immortal
 

3875
01:06:46,799 --> 01:06:48,870
emphasize i didn't think i was immortal
like i knew at some level i'm probably

3876
01:06:48,870 --> 01:06:48,880
like i knew at some level i'm probably
 

3877
01:06:48,880 --> 01:06:52,470
like i knew at some level i'm probably
gonna die everyone dies yeah but

3878
01:06:52,470 --> 01:06:52,480
gonna die everyone dies yeah but
 

3879
01:06:52,480 --> 01:06:53,430
gonna die everyone dies yeah but
there's

3880
01:06:53,430 --> 01:06:53,440
there's
 

3881
01:06:53,440 --> 01:06:55,589
there's
ways that you can sort of

3882
01:06:55,589 --> 01:06:55,599
ways that you can sort of
 

3883
01:06:55,599 --> 01:06:58,150
ways that you can sort of
poke around with that idea i still do it

3884
01:06:58,150 --> 01:06:58,160
poke around with that idea i still do it
 

3885
01:06:58,160 --> 01:07:00,630
poke around with that idea i still do it
to this day like i still do it like it's

3886
01:07:00,630 --> 01:07:00,640
to this day like i still do it like it's
 

3887
01:07:00,640 --> 01:07:01,990
to this day like i still do it like it's
a natural thing to do when you're

3888
01:07:01,990 --> 01:07:02,000
a natural thing to do when you're
 

3889
01:07:02,000 --> 01:07:04,950
a natural thing to do when you're
confronted with that with annihilation

3890
01:07:04,950 --> 01:07:04,960
confronted with that with annihilation
 

3891
01:07:04,960 --> 01:07:06,950
confronted with that with annihilation
you want a way out you want to talk your

3892
01:07:06,950 --> 01:07:06,960
you want a way out you want to talk your
 

3893
01:07:06,960 --> 01:07:08,870
you want a way out you want to talk your
way out figure it out there's got to be

3894
01:07:08,870 --> 01:07:08,880
way out figure it out there's got to be
 

3895
01:07:08,880 --> 01:07:10,789
way out figure it out there's got to be
some way to fix it well they'll fix it

3896
01:07:10,789 --> 01:07:10,799
some way to fix it well they'll fix it
 

3897
01:07:10,799 --> 01:07:12,470
some way to fix it well they'll fix it
that's another thing people do oh

3898
01:07:12,470 --> 01:07:12,480
that's another thing people do oh
 

3899
01:07:12,480 --> 01:07:14,870
that's another thing people do oh
they'll fix it yeah it'd be fine they'll

3900
01:07:14,870 --> 01:07:14,880
they'll fix it yeah it'd be fine they'll
 

3901
01:07:14,880 --> 01:07:16,950
they'll fix it yeah it'd be fine they'll
expand the human lifespan that's what

3902
01:07:16,950 --> 01:07:16,960
expand the human lifespan that's what
 

3903
01:07:16,960 --> 01:07:18,950
expand the human lifespan that's what
they'll do i mean that was though that's

3904
01:07:18,950 --> 01:07:18,960
they'll do i mean that was though that's
 

3905
01:07:18,960 --> 01:07:21,190
they'll do i mean that was though that's
a big argument for it is like look the

3906
01:07:21,190 --> 01:07:21,200
a big argument for it is like look the
 

3907
01:07:21,200 --> 01:07:23,589
a big argument for it is like look the
human lifespan up until covid which they

3908
01:07:23,589 --> 01:07:23,599
human lifespan up until covid which they
 

3909
01:07:23,599 --> 01:07:25,750
human lifespan up until covid which they
had to recalculate like the

3910
01:07:25,750 --> 01:07:25,760
had to recalculate like the
 

3911
01:07:25,760 --> 01:07:28,309
had to recalculate like the
lifespan because of the statistically

3912
01:07:28,309 --> 01:07:28,319
lifespan because of the statistically
 

3913
01:07:28,319 --> 01:07:29,829
lifespan because of the statistically
all the people who died it like threw it

3914
01:07:29,829 --> 01:07:29,839
all the people who died it like threw it
 

3915
01:07:29,839 --> 01:07:32,630
all the people who died it like threw it
off a little bit but pandemics aside

3916
01:07:32,630 --> 01:07:32,640
off a little bit but pandemics aside
 

3917
01:07:32,640 --> 01:07:34,549
off a little bit but pandemics aside
the idea was the human lifespan seemed

3918
01:07:34,549 --> 01:07:34,559
the idea was the human lifespan seemed
 

3919
01:07:34,559 --> 01:07:36,390
the idea was the human lifespan seemed
to be increasing

3920
01:07:36,390 --> 01:07:36,400
to be increasing
 

3921
01:07:36,400 --> 01:07:37,750
to be increasing
by half

3922
01:07:37,750 --> 01:07:37,760
by half
 

3923
01:07:37,760 --> 01:07:39,670
by half
a year every year something like that we

3924
01:07:39,670 --> 01:07:39,680
a year every year something like that we
 

3925
01:07:39,680 --> 01:07:41,109
a year every year something like that we
are living longer

3926
01:07:41,109 --> 01:07:41,119
are living longer
 

3927
01:07:41,119 --> 01:07:43,029
are living longer
so all you got to do

3928
01:07:43,029 --> 01:07:43,039
so all you got to do
 

3929
01:07:43,039 --> 01:07:45,029
so all you got to do
one more half a year

3930
01:07:45,029 --> 01:07:45,039
one more half a year
 

3931
01:07:45,039 --> 01:07:47,349
one more half a year
and we're immortal right if we can if we

3932
01:07:47,349 --> 01:07:47,359
and we're immortal right if we can if we
 

3933
01:07:47,359 --> 01:07:49,750
and we're immortal right if we can if we
live a year longer every year then we

3934
01:07:49,750 --> 01:07:49,760
live a year longer every year then we
 

3935
01:07:49,760 --> 01:07:50,870
live a year longer every year then we
live forever

3936
01:07:50,870 --> 01:07:50,880
live forever
 

3937
01:07:50,880 --> 01:07:52,950
live forever
and so that's another way you can get

3938
01:07:52,950 --> 01:07:52,960
and so that's another way you can get
 

3939
01:07:52,960 --> 01:07:53,750
and so that's another way you can get
out of

3940
01:07:53,750 --> 01:07:53,760
out of
 

3941
01:07:53,760 --> 01:07:55,670
out of
confronting death is you can think well

3942
01:07:55,670 --> 01:07:55,680
confronting death is you can think well
 

3943
01:07:55,680 --> 01:07:58,309
confronting death is you can think well
maybe right now we don't have the tech

3944
01:07:58,309 --> 01:07:58,319
maybe right now we don't have the tech
 

3945
01:07:58,319 --> 01:08:00,630
maybe right now we don't have the tech
but it's coming consciousness

3946
01:08:00,630 --> 01:08:00,640
but it's coming consciousness
 

3947
01:08:00,640 --> 01:08:01,829
but it's coming consciousness

3951
01:08:03,760 --> 01:08:05,430

how you want to look at it another way

3952
01:08:05,430 --> 01:08:05,440
how you want to look at it another way
 

3953
01:08:05,440 --> 01:08:07,430
how you want to look at it another way
people try to squirm out of the

3954
01:08:07,430 --> 01:08:07,440
people try to squirm out of the
 

3955
01:08:07,440 --> 01:08:08,870
people try to squirm out of the
reality of

3956
01:08:08,870 --> 01:08:08,880
reality of
 

3957
01:08:08,880 --> 01:08:11,510
reality of
death there's all kinds of tricks yeah

3958
01:08:11,510 --> 01:08:11,520
death there's all kinds of tricks yeah
 

3959
01:08:11,520 --> 01:08:12,549
death there's all kinds of tricks yeah
and we do

3960
01:08:12,549 --> 01:08:12,559
and we do
 

3961

and i'm not trying to dodge it but i'm
just saying

4814
01:23:27,189 --> 01:23:27,199
just saying
 

4815
01:23:27,199 --> 01:23:29,110
just saying
it was very natural that the death of

4816
01:23:29,110 --> 01:23:29,120
it was very natural that the death of
 

4817

very different
but there's a lot of ways in which

4830
01:23:44,870 --> 01:23:44,880
but there's a lot of ways in which
 

4831
01:23:44,880 --> 01:23:47,110
but there's a lot of ways in which
you're very much the same sure and i

wonder if that
 

4835
01:23:49,360 --> 01:23:51,510
wonder if that
if there's if life is defined by many

4836
01:23:51,510 --> 01:23:51,520
if there's if life is defined by many
 

4837
01:23:51,520 --> 01:23:54,149
if there's if life is defined by many
deaths that contin that continue on and

deaths that contin that continue on and
 

4839
01:23:54,159 --> 01:23:56,149
deaths that contin that continue on and
then there i wonder if there's something

archipelago oh my god and you know one
 

4923
01:25:18,080 --> 01:25:19,590
archipelago oh my god and you know one
of the things they said they would feed

4924
01:25:19,590 --> 01:25:19,600
of the things they said they would feed
 

4925
01:25:19,600 --> 01:25:22,390
of the things they said they would feed
the prisoners salt

4926
01:25:22,390 --> 01:25:22,400
the prisoners salt
 

4927
01:25:22,400 --> 01:25:23,830
the prisoners salt
um

4928
01:25:23,830 --> 01:25:23,840
um
 

4929
01:25:23,840 --> 01:25:26,390
um
and then they would exchange

4930
01:25:26,390 --> 01:25:26,400
and then they would exchange
 

4931
01:25:26,400 --> 01:25:28,550
and then they would exchange
the prisoners would be able to

4932
01:25:28,550 --> 01:25:28,560
the prisoners would be able to
 

4933
01:25:28,560 --> 01:25:30,790
the prisoners would be able to
give up anything everything their gold

4934
01:25:30,790 --> 01:25:30,800
give up anything everything their gold
 

4935
01:25:30,800 --> 01:25:32,310
give up anything everything their gold
their possessions everything for just

4936
01:25:32,310 --> 01:25:32,320
their possessions everything for just
 

4937
01:25:32,320 --> 01:25:34,629
their possessions everything for just
one drink of water so that little

4938
01:25:34,629 --> 01:25:34,639
one drink of water so that little
 

4939
01:25:34,639 --> 01:25:36,550
one drink of water so that little
context of

4940
01:25:36,550 --> 01:25:36,560
context of
 

4941
01:25:36,560 --> 01:25:39,030
context of
dehydrating them and feeding them salt

4942
01:25:39,030 --> 01:25:39,040
dehydrating them and feeding them salt
 

4943
01:25:39,040 --> 01:25:41,110
dehydrating them and feeding them salt
changes your value system completely

4944
01:25:41,110 --> 01:25:41,120
changes your value system completely
 

4945
01:25:41,120 --> 01:25:43,350
changes your value system completely
right so maybe the gold is supposed to

4946
01:25:43,350 --> 01:25:43,360
right so maybe the gold is supposed to
 

4947
01:25:43,360 --> 01:25:44,950
right so maybe the gold is supposed to
be a metaphor for something that you

4948
01:25:44,950 --> 01:25:44,960
be a metaphor for something that you
 

4949
01:25:44,960 --> 01:25:47,669
be a metaphor for something that you
still value deeply yes it's yeah again

4950
01:25:47,669 --> 01:25:47,679
still value deeply yes it's yeah again
 

4951
01:25:47,679 --> 01:25:49,350
still value deeply yes it's yeah again
any any of these things when you like

4952
01:25:49,350 --> 01:25:49,360
any any of these things when you like
 

4953
01:25:49,360 --> 01:25:51,270
any any of these things when you like
take them literally they seem absurd but

4954
01:25:51,270 --> 01:25:51,280
take them literally they seem absurd but
 

4955
01:25:51,280 --> 01:25:52,950
take them literally they seem absurd but
if you look deeper into it it's like

4956
01:25:52,950 --> 01:25:52,960
if you look deeper into it it's like
 

4957
01:25:52,960 --> 01:25:55,590
if you look deeper into it it's like
quite beautiful but the buddhist version

4958
01:25:55,590 --> 01:25:55,600
quite beautiful but the buddhist version
 

4959
01:25:55,600 --> 01:25:58,149
quite beautiful but the buddhist version
of it is that uh there's a momentum the

4960
01:25:58,149 --> 01:25:58,159
of it is that uh there's a momentum the
 

4961
01:25:58,159 --> 01:25:59,430
of it is that uh there's a momentum the
best way to put it is it's a kind of

4962
01:25:59,430 --> 01:25:59,440
best way to put it is it's a kind of
 

4963
01:25:59,440 --> 01:26:01,430
best way to put it is it's a kind of
momentum so

4964
01:26:01,430 --> 01:26:01,440
momentum so
 

4965
01:26:01,440 --> 01:26:02,950
momentum so
uh the thing you're talking about which

4966
01:26:02,950 --> 01:26:02,960
uh the thing you're talking about which
 

4967
01:26:02,960 --> 01:26:04,390
uh the thing you're talking about which
is uh

4968
01:26:04,390 --> 01:26:04,400
is uh
 

4969
01:26:04,400 --> 01:26:06,790
is uh
the personality of the baby that is

4970
01:26:06,790 --> 01:26:06,800
the personality of the baby that is
 

4971
01:26:06,800 --> 01:26:09,030
the personality of the baby that is
still in the adult which is still in the

4972
01:26:09,030 --> 01:26:09,040
still in the adult which is still in the
 

4973
01:26:09,040 --> 01:26:11,830
still in the adult which is still in the
old person you're looking at a kind of

4974
01:26:11,830 --> 01:26:11,840
old person you're looking at a kind of
 

4975
01:26:11,840 --> 01:26:14,629
old person you're looking at a kind of
momentum that does not stop

4976
01:26:14,629 --> 01:26:14,639
momentum that does not stop
 

4977
01:26:14,639 --> 01:26:15,830
momentum that does not stop
upon the

4978
01:26:15,830 --> 01:26:15,840
upon the
 

4979
01:26:15,840 --> 01:26:17,910
upon the
extinction of the body

4980
01:26:17,910 --> 01:26:17,920
extinction of the body
 

4981
01:26:17,920 --> 01:26:18,790
extinction of the body
now

4982
01:26:18,790 --> 01:26:18,800
now
 

4983
01:26:18,800 --> 01:26:19,910
now
the

4984
01:26:19,910 --> 01:26:19,920
the
 

4985
01:26:19,920 --> 01:26:22,070
the
the

4986
01:26:22,070 --> 01:26:22,080
the
 

4987
01:26:22,080 --> 01:26:26,149
the
a i think there's a lot of uh

4988
01:26:26,149 --> 01:26:26,159

 

4989
01:26:26,159 --> 01:26:27,669

i don't want to say harm because they

4990
01:26:27,669 --> 01:26:27,679
i don't want to say harm because they
 

4991
01:26:27,679 --> 01:26:29,030
i don't want to say harm because they
didn't mean to hurt but i think there's

4992
01:26:29,030 --> 01:26:29,040
didn't mean to hurt but i think there's
 

4993
01:26:29,040 --> 01:26:30,629
didn't mean to hurt but i think there's
some harm that maybe has happened from

4994
01:26:30,629 --> 01:26:30,639
some harm that maybe has happened from
 

4995
01:26:30,639 --> 01:26:31,910
some harm that maybe has happened from
the way death

4996
01:26:31,910 --> 01:26:31,920
the way death
 

4997
01:26:31,920 --> 01:26:33,990
the way death
is represented in movies like when

4998
01:26:33,990 --> 01:26:34,000
is represented in movies like when
 

4999
01:26:34,000 --> 01:26:36,390
is represented in movies like when
people die in movies it's like

5000
01:26:36,390 --> 01:26:36,400
people die in movies it's like
 

5001
01:26:36,400 --> 01:26:38,470
people die in movies it's like
there's this usually it's pretty fast

5002
01:26:38,470 --> 01:26:38,480
there's this usually it's pretty fast
 

5003
01:26:38,480 --> 01:26:40,149
there's this usually it's pretty fast
even if it is uh

5004
01:26:40,149 --> 01:26:40,159
even if it is uh
 

5005
01:26:40,159 --> 01:26:41,750
even if it is uh
what they're dying from is a long-term

5006
01:26:41,750 --> 01:26:41,760
what they're dying from is a long-term
 

5007
01:26:41,760 --> 01:26:44,229
what they're dying from is a long-term
disease it like wraps up pretty quickly

5008
01:26:44,229 --> 01:26:44,239
disease it like wraps up pretty quickly
 

5009
01:26:44,239 --> 01:26:46,629
disease it like wraps up pretty quickly
starts with a cough the person's in bed

5010
01:26:46,629 --> 01:26:46,639
starts with a cough the person's in bed
 

5011
01:26:46,639 --> 01:26:49,110
starts with a cough the person's in bed
but there's this weird kind of lucidity

5012
01:26:49,110 --> 01:26:49,120
but there's this weird kind of lucidity
 

5013
01:26:49,120 --> 01:26:50,870
but there's this weird kind of lucidity
to the person up until the point of

5014
01:26:50,870 --> 01:26:50,880
to the person up until the point of
 

5015
01:26:50,880 --> 01:26:53,030
to the person up until the point of
death and also they generally in movies

5016
01:26:53,030 --> 01:26:53,040
death and also they generally in movies
 

5017
01:26:53,040 --> 01:26:54,390
death and also they generally in movies
they have makeup on which is always

5018
01:26:54,390 --> 01:26:54,400
they have makeup on which is always
 

5019
01:26:54,400 --> 01:26:56,470
they have makeup on which is always
funny to me when the person dying looks

5020
01:26:56,470 --> 01:26:56,480
funny to me when the person dying looks
 

5021
01:26:56,480 --> 01:26:58,229
funny to me when the person dying looks
great if you're ever around a dying

5022
01:26:58,229 --> 01:26:58,239
great if you're ever around a dying
 

5023
01:26:58,239 --> 01:27:01,270
great if you're ever around a dying

confused they're
 

5029
01:27:06,239 --> 01:27:07,430
confused they're
you know when you're around dying people

5030
01:27:07,430 --> 01:27:07,440
you know when you're around dying people
 

5031
01:27:07,440 --> 01:27:09,830
you know when you're around dying people
they will spin through time

5032
01:27:09,830 --> 01:27:09,840
they will spin through time
 

5033
01:27:09,840 --> 01:27:11,430
they will spin through time
your parents won't recognize you for a

5034
01:27:11,430 --> 01:27:11,440
your parents won't recognize you for a
 

5035
01:27:11,440 --> 01:27:12,709
your parents won't recognize you for a
second they'll think you're somebody

5036
01:27:12,709 --> 01:27:12,719
second they'll think you're somebody
 

5037
01:27:12,719 --> 01:27:14,950
second they'll think you're somebody
else they won't they're like

5038
01:27:14,950 --> 01:27:14,960
else they won't they're like
 

5039
01:27:14,960 --> 01:27:16,390
else they won't they're like
everything's

5040
01:27:16,390 --> 01:27:16,400
everything's
 

5041
01:27:16,400 --> 01:27:17,910
everything's
everything's like the process is

5042
01:27:17,910 --> 01:27:17,920
everything's like the process is
 

5043
01:27:17,920 --> 01:27:19,669
everything's like the process is
happening so

5044
01:27:19,669 --> 01:27:19,679
happening so
 

5045
01:27:19,679 --> 01:27:21,990
happening so
it's a you're very confused when you die

5046
01:27:21,990 --> 01:27:22,000
it's a you're very confused when you die
 

5047
01:27:22,000 --> 01:27:23,590
it's a you're very confused when you die
so

5048
01:27:23,590 --> 01:27:23,600
so
 

5049
01:27:23,600 --> 01:27:25,430
so
in general not all the time some people

5050
01:27:25,430 --> 01:27:25,440
in general not all the time some people
 

5051
01:27:25,440 --> 01:27:26,870
in general not all the time some people
die with a with a clear mind it just

5052
01:27:26,870 --> 01:27:26,880
die with a with a clear mind it just
 

5053
01:27:26,880 --> 01:27:29,189
die with a with a clear mind it just
depends on the type of death but

5054
01:27:29,189 --> 01:27:29,199
depends on the type of death but
 

5055
01:27:29,199 --> 01:27:30,709
depends on the type of death but
think in terms of

5056
01:27:30,709 --> 01:27:30,719
think in terms of
 

5057
01:27:30,719 --> 01:27:32,709
think in terms of
uh getting hit by a car so you want to

5058
01:27:32,709 --> 01:27:32,719
uh getting hit by a car so you want to
 

5059
01:27:32,719 --> 01:27:35,350
uh getting hit by a car so you want to
cross the street you get hit by a car

5060
01:27:35,350 --> 01:27:35,360
cross the street you get hit by a car
 

5061
01:27:35,360 --> 01:27:36,229
cross the street you get hit by a car
now

5062
01:27:36,229 --> 01:27:36,239
now
 

5063
01:27:36,239 --> 01:27:38,550
now
if we're talking about this momentum

5064
01:27:38,550 --> 01:27:38,560
if we're talking about this momentum
 

5065
01:27:38,560 --> 01:27:40,629
if we're talking about this momentum
continuing

5066
01:27:40,629 --> 01:27:40,639
continuing
 

5067
01:27:40,639 --> 01:27:42,229
continuing
the confusion assuming you didn't hit

5068
01:27:42,229 --> 01:27:42,239
the confusion assuming you didn't hit
 

5069
01:27:42,239 --> 01:27:43,910
the confusion assuming you didn't hit
your head and you're unconscious like

5070
01:27:43,910 --> 01:27:43,920
your head and you're unconscious like
 

5071
01:27:43,920 --> 01:27:45,669
your head and you're unconscious like
somehow you just got smashed and you're

5072
01:27:45,669 --> 01:27:45,679
somehow you just got smashed and you're
 

5073
01:27:45,679 --> 01:27:47,590
somehow you just got smashed and you're
like bleeding out

5074
01:27:47,590 --> 01:27:47,600
like bleeding out
 

5075
01:27:47,600 --> 01:27:49,030
like bleeding out
even then you're going to be confused

5076
01:27:49,030 --> 01:27:49,040
even then you're going to be confused
 

5077
01:27:49,040 --> 01:27:50,790
even then you're going to be confused
because you're getting dizzy like

5078
01:27:50,790 --> 01:27:50,800

if you don't catch it you could just be

5198
01:29:48,629 --> 01:29:48,639
if you don't catch it you could just be
 

5199
01:29:48,639 --> 01:29:50,070
if you don't catch it you could just be
like wow i guess it's act like an

seeing your [\h__\h] projection

5204
01:29:55,270 --> 01:29:55,280
seeing your [\h__\h] projection
 

5205
01:29:55,280 --> 01:29:57,990
seeing your [\h__\h] projection
like being reflected off the screen of

5206
01:29:57,990 --> 01:29:58,000
like being reflected off the screen of
 

5207
01:29:58,000 --> 01:29:59,590
like being reflected off the screen of
another person so in the bardo

5208
01:29:59,590 --> 01:29:59,600
another person so in the bardo
 

5209
01:29:59,600 --> 01:30:01,350
another person so in the bardo
apparently you don't need people for the

5210
01:30:01,350 --> 01:30:01,360
apparently you don't need people for the
 

5211
01:30:01,360 --> 01:30:03,350
apparently you don't need people for the
reflective quality

5212
01:30:03,350 --> 01:30:03,360
reflective quality
 

5213
01:30:03,360 --> 01:30:05,830
reflective quality
these projections happen and there they

5214
01:30:05,830 --> 01:30:05,840
these projections happen and there they
 

5215
01:30:05,840 --> 01:30:07,910
these projections happen and there they
appear as either

5216
01:30:07,910 --> 01:30:07,920
appear as either
 

5217
01:30:07,920 --> 01:30:10,390
appear as either
nietzsche's demon or nietzsche's angel

5218
01:30:10,390 --> 01:30:10,400
nietzsche's demon or nietzsche's angel
 

5219
01:30:10,400 --> 01:30:11,990
nietzsche's demon or nietzsche's angel
it just depends on

5220
01:30:11,990 --> 01:30:12,000
it just depends on
 

5221
01:30:12,000 --> 01:30:14,550
it just depends on
where you're at and how you died and

5222
01:30:14,550 --> 01:30:14,560
where you're at and how you died and
 

5223
01:30:14,560 --> 01:30:17,030
where you're at and how you died and
like if you died scared

5224
01:30:17,030 --> 01:30:17,040
like if you died scared
 

5225
01:30:17,040 --> 01:30:18,709
like if you died scared
then at least initially that's gonna be

5226
01:30:18,709 --> 01:30:18,719
then at least initially that's gonna be
 

5227
01:30:18,719 --> 01:30:21,030
then at least initially that's gonna be
some scary [\h__\h] you see around you if

5228
01:30:21,030 --> 01:30:21,040
some scary [\h__\h] you see around you if
 

5229
01:30:21,040 --> 01:30:24,229
some scary [\h__\h] you see around you if
you died in a peaceful way well then

5230
01:30:24,229 --> 01:30:24,239
you died in a peaceful way well then
 

5231
01:30:24,239 --> 01:30:25,189
you died in a peaceful way well then
uh

5232
01:30:25,189 --> 01:30:25,199
uh
 

5233
01:30:25,199 --> 01:30:26,229
uh
there's going to be more of a

5234
01:30:26,229 --> 01:30:26,239
there's going to be more of a
 

5235
01:30:26,239 --> 01:30:30,709
there's going to be more of a
possibility of navigation through this

5236
01:30:30,709 --> 01:30:30,719
possibility of navigation through this
 

5237
01:30:30,719 --> 01:30:33,270
possibility of navigation through this
liminal intermediary

5238
01:30:33,270 --> 01:30:33,280
liminal intermediary
 

5239
01:30:33,280 --> 01:30:36,709
liminal intermediary
place and so thus the emphasis on

5240
01:30:36,709 --> 01:30:36,719
place and so thus the emphasis on
 

5241
01:30:36,719 --> 01:30:39,750

meditation in buddhism a way to

5242
01:30:39,750 --> 01:30:39,760
meditation in buddhism a way to

calm one's self to not be distracted by
 

5245
01:30:42,960 --> 01:30:44,709
calm one's self to not be distracted by
thoughts which are their own like

5246
01:30:44,709 --> 01:30:44,719
thoughts which are their own like
 

5247
01:30:44,719 --> 01:30:45,990
thoughts which are their own like
apparitions

5248
01:30:45,990 --> 01:30:46,000
apparitions
 

5249
01:30:46,000 --> 01:30:47,110
apparitions
and then

5250
01:30:47,110 --> 01:30:47,120
and then
 

5251
01:30:47,120 --> 01:30:49,030
and then
theoretically if you wanted to

5252
01:30:49,030 --> 01:30:49,040
theoretically if you wanted to
 

5253
01:30:49,040 --> 01:30:50,310
theoretically if you wanted to
instead of

5254
01:30:50,310 --> 01:30:50,320
instead of
 

5255
01:30:50,320 --> 01:30:52,470
instead of
spinning the wheel again and jumping

5256
01:30:52,470 --> 01:30:52,480
spinning the wheel again and jumping
 

5257
01:30:52,480 --> 01:30:54,229
spinning the wheel again and jumping
back into a body

5258
01:30:54,229 --> 01:30:54,239
back into a body
 

5259
01:30:54,239 --> 01:30:57,110
back into a body
you could choose not to do that and then

5260
01:30:57,110 --> 01:30:57,120
you could choose not to do that and then
 

5261
01:30:57,120 --> 01:30:59,270
you could choose not to do that and then
you know transcend the wheel of birth

5262
01:30:59,270 --> 01:30:59,280
you know transcend the wheel of birth
 

5263
01:30:59,280 --> 01:31:01,590
you know transcend the wheel of birth
and death but if you still wanted to go

5264
01:31:01,590 --> 01:31:01,600
and death but if you still wanted to go
 

5265
01:31:01,600 --> 01:31:02,709
and death but if you still wanted to go
back

5266
01:31:02,709 --> 01:31:02,719
back
 

5267
01:31:02,719 --> 01:31:04,070
back
or

5268
01:31:04,070 --> 01:31:04,080
or
 

5269
01:31:04,080 --> 01:31:05,669
or
return or whatever however you want to

5270
01:31:05,669 --> 01:31:05,679
return or whatever however you want to
 

5271
01:31:05,679 --> 01:31:08,709
return or whatever however you want to
put it then you could have more control

5272
01:31:08,709 --> 01:31:08,719
put it then you could have more control
 

5273
01:31:08,719 --> 01:31:12,070
put it then you could have more control
over what your next birth might be

5274
01:31:12,070 --> 01:31:12,080
over what your next birth might be
 

5275
01:31:12,080 --> 01:31:13,750
over what your next birth might be
versus

5276
01:31:13,750 --> 01:31:13,760
versus
 

5277
01:31:13,760 --> 01:31:15,510
versus
in this depiction of things people

5278
01:31:15,510 --> 01:31:15,520
in this depiction of things people
 

5279
01:31:15,520 --> 01:31:17,350
in this depiction of things people
running from

5280
01:31:17,350 --> 01:31:17,360
running from
 

5281
01:31:17,360 --> 01:31:18,950
running from
demons that they don't recognize as

5282
01:31:18,950 --> 01:31:18,960
demons that they don't recognize as
 

5283
01:31:18,960 --> 01:31:20,870
demons that they don't recognize as
their own projection

5284
01:31:20,870 --> 01:31:20,880
their own projection
 

5285
01:31:20,880 --> 01:31:24,229
their own projection
into any [\h__\h] body that they can find

5286
01:31:24,229 --> 01:31:24,239
into any [\h__\h] body that they can find
 

5287
01:31:24,239 --> 01:31:26,070
into any [\h__\h] body that they can find
because if you've had a body you want a

5288
01:31:26,070 --> 01:31:26,080
because if you've had a body you want a
 

5289
01:31:26,080 --> 01:31:28,310
because if you've had a body you want a
body and so this is how you can

5290
01:31:28,310 --> 01:31:28,320
body and so this is how you can
 

5291
01:31:28,320 --> 01:31:29,830
body and so this is how you can
incarnate as an animal this is how you

5292
01:31:29,830 --> 01:31:29,840
incarnate as an animal this is how you
 

5293
01:31:29,840 --> 01:31:32,149
incarnate as an animal this is how you
can incarnate in the hell realms this is

5294
01:31:32,149 --> 01:31:32,159
can incarnate in the hell realms this is
 

5295
01:31:32,159 --> 01:31:33,669
can incarnate in the hell realms this is
how you could incarnate in any variety

5296
01:31:33,669 --> 01:31:33,679
how you could incarnate in any variety
 

5297
01:31:33,679 --> 01:31:36,070
how you could incarnate in any variety
of things but the idea is like maybe you

5298
01:31:36,070 --> 01:31:36,080
of things but the idea is like maybe you
 

5299
01:31:36,080 --> 01:31:39,030
of things but the idea is like maybe you
could slow down a little bit and like

5300
01:31:39,030 --> 01:31:39,040
could slow down a little bit and like
 

5301
01:31:39,040 --> 01:31:40,950
could slow down a little bit and like
choose a birth that is going to be more

maybe a better translation is wobbly

5390
01:33:13,350 --> 01:33:13,360
maybe a better translation is wobbly
 

5391
01:33:13,360 --> 01:33:14,229
maybe a better translation is wobbly

doesn't have air in the tires it's kind
 

5401
01:33:21,199 --> 01:33:22,950
doesn't have air in the tires it's kind
of a shitty bike ride like no matter

5402

for four days so those four days are
 

5515
01:35:17,199 --> 01:35:19,669

what people say i'm excited about it
 

5519
01:35:22,080 --> 01:35:24,550
what people say i'm excited about it
but really if you look at that feeling

5520
01:35:24,550 --> 01:35:24,560
but really if you look at that feeling
 

5521
01:35:24,560 --> 01:35:26,470
but really if you look at that feeling
it's uncomfortable like the feeling of

it's uncomfortable like the feeling of
wanting the thing is uncomfortable

wanting the thing is uncomfortable
 

5525
01:35:28,560 --> 01:35:29,350
wanting the thing is uncomfortable
so

5526
01:35:29,350 --> 01:35:29,360
so
 

5527
01:35:29,360 --> 01:35:31,270
so
that is a form of suffering that's

5528
01:35:31,270 --> 01:35:31,280
that is a form of suffering that's
 

5529

suffering
 

5531
01:35:32,239 --> 01:35:34,310
suffering
interesting i mean i wonder

5532
01:35:34,310 --> 01:35:34,320
interesting i mean i wonder
 

5533
01:35:34,320 --> 01:35:36,629
interesting i mean i wonder
because we naturally reframe that in our

5534
01:35:36,629 --> 01:35:36,639
because we naturally reframe that in our
 

5535
01:35:36,639 --> 01:35:37,669
because we naturally reframe that in our
mind

5536
01:35:37,669 --> 01:35:37,679
mind
 

5537
01:35:37,679 --> 01:35:38,790
mind
wanting

5538
01:35:38,790 --> 01:35:38,800
wanting
 

5539
01:35:38,800 --> 01:35:44,070
wanting
we reframe that as a good thing as um

5540
01:35:44,070 --> 01:35:44,080
we reframe that as a good thing as um
 

5541
01:35:44,080 --> 01:35:47,750
we reframe that as a good thing as um
and maybe suffering is

5542
01:35:47,750 --> 01:35:47,760

 

5543
01:35:47,760 --> 01:35:49,750

fundamentally good

01:35:49,750 --> 01:35:49,760
fundamentally good
 

5545
01:35:49,760 --> 01:35:52,950
fundamentally good
in the way we think of what life is

5546
01:35:52,950 --> 01:35:52,960
in the way we think of what life is
 

5547
01:35:52,960 --> 01:35:55,510
in the way we think of what life is
like it's life affirming

01:35:55,510 --> 01:35:55,520
like it's life affirming

01:39:04,709 --> 01:39:04,719
you know what it's it's not just the
 

5725
01:39:04,719 --> 01:39:07,270
you know what it's it's not just the
desire it's what is having the desire

5726
01:39:07,270 --> 01:39:07,280
desire it's what is having the desire
 

5727
01:39:07,280 --> 01:39:09,590
desire it's what is having the desire
where does the desire live in like what

5728
01:39:09,590 --> 01:39:09,600
where does the desire live in like what
 

5729
01:39:09,600 --> 01:39:12,070
where does the desire live in like what
doesn't want to be where it's at what is

5730
01:39:12,070 --> 01:39:12,080
doesn't want to be where it's at what is
 

5731
01:39:12,080 --> 01:39:14,390
doesn't want to be where it's at what is
the thing that is like

5732
01:39:14,390 --> 01:39:14,400
the thing that is like
 

5733
01:39:14,400 --> 01:39:16,310
the thing that is like
desperately wanting to get out of the

5734
01:39:16,310 --> 01:39:16,320
desperately wanting to get out of the
 

5735
01:39:16,320 --> 01:39:19,669
desperately wanting to get out of the
situation it's in and then um as far as

5736
01:39:19,669 --> 01:39:19,679
situation it's in and then um as far as
 

5737
01:39:19,679 --> 01:39:22,550
situation it's in and then um as far as
ignorance uh it's still something that's

5738
01:39:22,550 --> 01:39:22,560
ignorance uh it's still something that's
 

5739
01:39:22,560 --> 01:39:25,510
ignorance uh it's still something that's
theoretically happening to an identity

5740
01:39:25,510 --> 01:39:25,520
theoretically happening to an identity
 

5741
01:39:25,520 --> 01:39:26,629
theoretically happening to an identity
so

5742
01:39:26,629 --> 01:39:26,639
so
 

5743
01:39:26,639 --> 01:39:29,510
so
so wrapped up in it is really just this

5744
01:39:29,510 --> 01:39:29,520
so wrapped up in it is really just this
 

5745
01:39:29,520 --> 01:39:31,109
so wrapped up in it is really just this
sort of like and that's where we run

5746
01:39:31,109 --> 01:39:31,119
sort of like and that's where we run
 

5747
01:39:31,119 --> 01:39:33,109
sort of like and that's where we run
into what

5748
01:39:33,109 --> 01:39:33,119
into what
 

5749
01:39:33,119 --> 01:39:35,350
into what
into attachment so if

5750
01:39:35,350 --> 01:39:35,360
into attachment so if
 

5751
01:39:35,360 --> 01:39:37,350
into attachment so if
if the first noble truth of buddhism is

5752
01:39:37,350 --> 01:39:37,360
if the first noble truth of buddhism is
 

5753
01:39:37,360 --> 01:39:38,790
if the first noble truth of buddhism is
there is suffering

5754
01:39:38,790 --> 01:39:38,800
there is suffering
 

5755
01:39:38,800 --> 01:39:41,430
there is suffering
the second noble truth of buddhism is

5756
01:39:41,430 --> 01:39:41,440
the second noble truth of buddhism is
 

5757
01:39:41,440 --> 01:39:43,430
the second noble truth of buddhism is
um the cause

5758
01:39:43,430 --> 01:39:43,440
um the cause
 

5759
01:39:43,440 --> 01:39:44,870
um the cause
of

5760
01:39:44,870 --> 01:39:44,880
of
 

5761
01:39:44,880 --> 01:39:47,510
of
this suffering is attachment and so

5762
01:39:47,510 --> 01:39:47,520
this suffering is attachment and so
 

5763

5765
01:39:50,560 --> 01:39:52,229
people hear that and they take it that's
a there's a lot of levels to that

5766
01:39:52,229 --> 01:39:52,239
a there's a lot of levels to that
 

5767
01:39:52,239 --> 01:39:53,990
a there's a lot of levels to that
concept definitely the cause of

5768
01:39:53,990 --> 01:39:54,000
concept definitely the cause of
 

5769
01:39:54,000 --> 01:39:55,830

go all the way to this
 

5793

go all the way to this
attachment to the sense of

5794
01:40:22,950 --> 01:40:22,960
attachment to the sense of
 

5795
01:40:22,960 --> 01:40:24,070
attachment to the sense of
one's

5796
01:40:24,070 --> 01:40:24,080
one's
 

5797
01:40:24,080 --> 01:40:26,870
one's
self and the i think the existentialists

5798
01:40:26,870 --> 01:40:26,880
self and the i think the existentialists
 

5799
01:40:26,880 --> 01:40:29,430
self and the i think the existentialists
do get into this idea in a different way

5800
01:40:29,430 --> 01:40:29,440
do get into this idea in a different way
 

5801
01:40:29,440 --> 01:40:30,470
do get into this idea in a different way
which is like

5802
01:40:30,470 --> 01:40:30,480
which is like
 

5803
01:40:30,480 --> 01:40:32,390
which is like
because i think i'm a me

5804
01:40:32,390 --> 01:40:32,400
because i think i'm a me
 

5805

now i have to push
what that thing is out into the world

5808
01:40:37,109 --> 01:40:37,119
what that thing is out into the world
 

5809
01:40:37,119 --> 01:40:39,109
what that thing is out into the world
through my actions and that's a kind of

5810
01:40:39,109 --> 01:40:39,119
through my actions and that's a kind of
 

5811
01:40:39,119 --> 01:40:40,470
through my actions and that's a kind of
attachment too

5812
01:40:40,470 --> 01:40:40,480
attachment too
 

5813
01:40:40,480 --> 01:40:42,870
attachment too
exactly there you go right and that

5814
01:40:42,870 --> 01:40:42,880
exactly there you go right and that
 

5815
01:40:42,880 --> 01:40:47,270
exactly there you go right and that
leads to the third noble truth which is

5816
01:40:47,270 --> 01:40:47,280

 

5817
01:40:47,280 --> 01:40:49,270

uh
that's it seems logical but you know it

5824
01:40:53,910 --> 01:40:53,920
that's it seems logical but you know it
 

5825
01:40:53,920 --> 01:40:55,189

01:40:58,070 --> 01:40:58,080
it is a mathematical analysis of
 

5829
01:40:58,080 --> 01:41:00,229

uh this particular problem of suffering

5830

01:55:27,669 --> 01:55:27,679
there's just layers of complexity in
 

6647
01:55:27,679 --> 01:55:29,830
there's just layers of complexity in
language that you it's very difficult to

02:10:07,119 --> 02:10:10,790
building and kills
hundreds of people

7496
02:10:10,790 --> 02:10:10,800

 

7497
02:10:10,800 --> 02:10:13,510

the worst effect of that rocket

7498
02:10:13,510 --> 02:10:13,520
the worst effect of that rocket
 

7499
02:10:13,520 --> 02:10:16,390
the worst effect of that rocket
is

7500
02:10:16,390 --> 02:10:16,400

 

7501
02:10:16,400 --> 02:10:19,669

is the hate in the hearts of the loved

ones
 

7505
02:10:21,440 --> 02:10:23,510
ones
to the people that were in that building

7506
02:10:23,510 --> 02:10:23,520
to the people that were in that building
 

7507
02:10:23,520 --> 02:10:27,350
to the people that were in that building
yes that hate is this is a torture over

a period of
 

7511
02:10:28,719 --> 02:10:31,669
a period of
years after and that it doesn't just

7512
02:10:31,669 --> 02:10:31,679
years after and that it doesn't just
 

7513
02:10:31,679 --> 02:10:33,030
years after and that it doesn't just
torture

7514
02:10:33,030 --> 02:10:33,040
torture
 

7515
02:10:33,040 --> 02:10:35,430

is there a sense where the people you're
 

7557
02:11:23,360 --> 02:11:25,030
is there a sense where the people you're
fighting are just brothers in arms

7558
02:11:25,030 --> 02:11:25,040
fighting are just brothers in arms
 

7559

fighting are just brothers in arms
bringing up the dire straight song

7560
02:11:26,550 --> 02:11:26,560
bringing up the dire straight song
 

7561
02:11:26,560 --> 02:11:28,790
bringing up the dire straight song
brothers in arms

7562
02:11:28,790 --> 02:11:28,800
brothers in arms
 

7563
02:11:28,800 --> 02:11:30,790
brothers in arms
and he was basically without swearing

7564
02:11:30,790 --> 02:11:30,800
and he was basically without swearing
 

7565
02:11:30,800 --> 02:11:32,950
and he was basically without swearing
saying [\h__\h] that that they're the enemy

7566
02:11:32,950 --> 02:11:32,960
saying [\h__\h] that that they're the enemy
 

7567
02:11:32,960 --> 02:11:35,430
saying [\h__\h] that that they're the enemy
yeah i mean he's literally in survival

7568
02:11:35,430 --> 02:11:35,440
yeah i mean he's literally in survival
 

7569
02:11:35,440 --> 02:11:37,430
yeah i mean he's literally in survival
mode yeah he can't think like that it's

7570
02:11:37,430 --> 02:11:37,440
mode yeah he can't think like that it's
 

7571
02:11:37,440 --> 02:11:39,030
mode yeah he can't think like that it's
going to create latency in the system

7572
02:11:39,030 --> 02:11:39,040
going to create latency in the system
 

7573
02:11:39,040 --> 02:11:40,790
going to create latency in the system
and that's going to lower survivability

7574
02:11:40,790 --> 02:11:40,800
and that's going to lower survivability
 

7575
02:11:40,800 --> 02:11:41,830
and that's going to lower survivability
you can't think that i mean we're

7576
02:11:41,830 --> 02:11:41,840
you can't think that i mean we're
 

7577
02:11:41,840 --> 02:11:44,550
you can't think that i mean we're
talking about like cognitively you can't

7578
02:11:44,550 --> 02:11:44,560
talking about like cognitively you can't
 

7579
02:11:44,560 --> 02:11:47,669
talking about like cognitively you can't
have latency like if you're that one

7580
02:11:47,669 --> 02:11:47,679
have latency like if you're that one
 

7581
02:11:47,679 --> 02:11:49,430
have latency like if you're that one
moment of hesitation like you see it

7582
02:11:49,430 --> 02:11:49,440
moment of hesitation like you see it
 

7583
02:11:49,440 --> 02:11:51,189
moment of hesitation like you see it
sometimes like in these youtube videos

7584
02:11:51,189 --> 02:11:51,199
sometimes like in these youtube videos
 

7585
02:11:51,199 --> 02:11:52,470
sometimes like in these youtube videos
of uh

7586
02:11:52,470 --> 02:11:52,480
of uh
 

7587
02:11:52,480 --> 02:11:53,910
of uh
like um

7588
02:11:53,910 --> 02:11:53,920
like um
 

7589
02:11:53,920 --> 02:11:55,270
like um
somebody

7590
02:11:55,270 --> 02:11:55,280
somebody
 

7591
02:11:55,280 --> 02:11:57,270
somebody
a a a new cop

7592
02:11:57,270 --> 02:11:57,280
a a a new cop
 

7593
02:11:57,280 --> 02:11:58,069
a a a new cop
has

7594
02:11:58,069 --> 02:11:58,079
has
 

7595
02:11:58,079 --> 02:11:59,589
has
been unfortunate enough to run into

7596
02:11:59,589 --> 02:11:59,599
been unfortunate enough to run into
 

7597
02:11:59,599 --> 02:12:01,669
been unfortunate enough to run into
something that is a phenomena suicide by

7598
02:12:01,669 --> 02:12:01,679
something that is a phenomena suicide by
 

7599
02:12:01,679 --> 02:12:03,030
something that is a phenomena suicide by
cop

7600
02:12:03,030 --> 02:12:03,040
cop
 

7601
02:12:03,040 --> 02:12:06,229
cop
somebody has a knife and that person is

7602
02:12:06,229 --> 02:12:06,239
somebody has a knife and that person is
 

7603
02:12:06,239 --> 02:12:08,069
somebody has a knife and that person is
running towards them with a knife and

7604
02:12:08,069 --> 02:12:08,079
running towards them with a knife and
 

7605
02:12:08,079 --> 02:12:10,950
running towards them with a knife and
they're begging the person to stop that

7606
02:12:10,950 --> 02:12:10,960
they're begging the person to stop that
 

7607
02:12:10,960 --> 02:12:12,790
they're begging the person to stop that
you can hear it in their voice they're

7608
02:12:12,790 --> 02:12:12,800
you can hear it in their voice they're
 

7609
02:12:12,800 --> 02:12:17,350
you can hear it in their voice they're
begging stop stop stop stop and the

7610
02:12:17,350 --> 02:12:17,360
begging stop stop stop stop and the
 

7611
02:12:17,360 --> 02:12:19,189
begging stop stop stop stop and the
person is not going to stop

7612
02:12:19,189 --> 02:12:19,199
person is not going to stop
 

7613
02:12:19,199 --> 02:12:21,430
person is not going to stop
so

7614
02:12:21,430 --> 02:12:21,440
so
 

7615
02:12:21,440 --> 02:12:23,830
so
the critique of that

7616
02:12:23,830 --> 02:12:23,840
the critique of that
 

7617
02:12:23,840 --> 02:12:24,870
the critique of that
is that

7618
02:12:24,870 --> 02:12:24,880
is that
 

7619
02:12:24,880 --> 02:12:25,669
is that
that

7620
02:12:25,669 --> 02:12:25,679
that
 

7621
02:12:25,679 --> 02:12:27,750
that
latency

7622
02:12:27,750 --> 02:12:27,760
latency
 

7623
02:12:27,760 --> 02:12:29,189
latency
could potentially not just lead to the

7624
02:12:29,189 --> 02:12:29,199
could potentially not just lead to the
 

7625
02:12:29,199 --> 02:12:30,470
could potentially not just lead to the
cop getting

7626
02:12:30,470 --> 02:12:30,480
cop getting
 

7627
02:12:30,480 --> 02:12:32,550
cop getting
killed but to that person

7628
02:12:32,550 --> 02:12:32,560
killed but to that person
 

7629
02:12:32,560 --> 02:12:35,430
killed but to that person
with a knife killing other people and so

7630
02:12:35,430 --> 02:12:35,440
with a knife killing other people and so
 

7631
02:12:35,440 --> 02:12:36,709
with a knife killing other people and so
you know

7632
02:12:36,709 --> 02:12:36,719
you know
 

7633
02:12:36,719 --> 02:12:39,589
you know
i get i i if i were out there i think

7634
02:12:39,589 --> 02:12:39,599
i get i i if i were out there i think
 

7635
02:12:39,599 --> 02:12:40,709
i get i i if i were out there i think
that like

7636
02:12:40,709 --> 02:12:40,719
that like
 

7637
02:12:40,719 --> 02:12:41,830
that like
you

7638
02:12:41,830 --> 02:12:41,840
you
 

7639
02:12:41,840 --> 02:12:44,149
you
you want you probably just as a matter

7640
02:12:44,149 --> 02:12:44,159
you want you probably just as a matter
 

7641
02:12:44,159 --> 02:12:45,109
you want you probably just as a matter
of like

7642
02:12:45,109 --> 02:12:45,119
of like
 

7643
02:12:45,119 --> 02:12:47,430
of like
not getting shot and being fully in the

7644
02:12:47,430 --> 02:12:47,440
not getting shot and being fully in the
 

7645
02:12:47,440 --> 02:12:48,950
not getting shot and being fully in the
moment you have to be like that i would

7646
02:12:48,950 --> 02:12:48,960
moment you have to be like that i would
 

7647
02:12:48,960 --> 02:12:50,629
moment you have to be like that i would
guess i don't know i don't know i'm the

7648
02:12:50,629 --> 02:12:50,639
guess i don't know i don't know i'm the
 

7649
02:12:50,639 --> 02:12:51,830
guess i don't know i don't know i'm the
furthest thing from a soldier there

7650
02:12:51,830 --> 02:12:51,840
furthest thing from a soldier there
 

7651
02:12:51,840 --> 02:12:53,030
furthest thing from a soldier there
could be but

7652
02:12:53,030 --> 02:12:53,040
could be but
 

7653
02:12:53,040 --> 02:12:56,310
could be but
there's a

7654
02:12:56,310 --> 02:12:56,320

 

7655
02:12:56,320 --> 02:12:57,750

something jack cornfield this great

7656
02:12:57,750 --> 02:12:57,760

all whatever the particular like thing
 

7755
02:14:39,679 --> 02:14:42,069
all whatever the particular like thing
is that you're supposed to not like it's

7756
02:14:42,069 --> 02:14:42,079
is that you're supposed to not like it's
 

7757
02:14:42,079 --> 02:14:44,069
is that you're supposed to not like it's
easier somehow weirdly you'd think

7758
02:14:44,069 --> 02:14:44,079
easier somehow weirdly you'd think
 

7759
02:14:44,079 --> 02:14:45,750
easier somehow weirdly you'd think
that'd be more difficult

7760
02:14:45,750 --> 02:14:45,760
that'd be more difficult
 

7761
02:14:45,760 --> 02:14:47,189

02:14:47,189 --> 02:14:47,199
yeah but
 

7763
02:14:47,199 --> 02:14:49,830
yeah but
i guess the lesson is uh

7764
02:14:49,830 --> 02:14:49,840
i guess the lesson is uh
 

7765
02:14:49,840 --> 02:14:53,589
i guess the lesson is uh
if you give in to the easy solution

7766
02:14:53,589 --> 02:14:53,599
if you give in to the easy solution
 

7767
02:14:53,599 --> 02:14:56,550
if you give in to the easy solution
that's going to uh lead to detrimental

7768
02:14:56,550 --> 02:14:56,560
that's going to uh lead to detrimental
 

7769
02:14:56,560 --> 02:14:58,229
that's going to uh lead to detrimental
long-term effects

7770
02:14:58,229 --> 02:14:58,239

feeling i mean that's the other thing

8018
02:18:51,509 --> 02:18:51,519
feeling i mean that's the other thing
 

8019
02:18:51,519 --> 02:18:53,429

8023
02:18:55,519 --> 02:18:57,509
you're like you you start going numb at
least that was my experience with it

8024
02:18:57,509 --> 02:18:57,519
least that was my experience with it
 

8025
02:18:57,519 --> 02:18:59,830
least that was my experience with it
numb and tired and then

8026
02:18:59,830 --> 02:18:59,840
numb and tired and then
 

8027
02:18:59,840 --> 02:19:01,589
numb and tired and then
increasingly numb and tired and then

8028
02:19:01,589 --> 02:19:01,599
increasingly numb and tired and then
 

8029
02:19:01,599 --> 02:19:04,150
increasingly numb and tired and then
increasingly sort of disconnecting from

8030
02:19:04,150 --> 02:19:04,160
increasingly sort of disconnecting from
 

8031
02:19:04,160 --> 02:19:06,230
increasingly sort of disconnecting from
reality and then somewhere in there

8032
02:19:06,230 --> 02:19:06,240
reality and then somewhere in there
 

8033
02:19:06,240 --> 02:19:07,429
reality and then somewhere in there
that's when you start playing around

8034
02:19:07,429 --> 02:19:07,439
that's when you start playing around
 

8035
02:19:07,439 --> 02:19:08,709
that's when you start playing around
with the idea

8036
02:19:08,709 --> 02:19:08,719
with the idea
 

8037
02:19:08,719 --> 02:19:10,709
with the idea
of like i don't know if it's worth it i

8038
02:19:10,709 --> 02:19:10,719
of like i don't know if it's worth it i
 

8039
02:19:10,719 --> 02:19:12,389
of like i don't know if it's worth it i
don't know now you know i think compared

8040
02:19:12,389 --> 02:19:12,399
don't know now you know i think compared
 

8041
02:19:12,399 --> 02:19:15,270
don't know now you know i think compared
to some of my friends who haven't

8042
02:19:15,270 --> 02:19:15,280
to some of my friends who haven't
 

8043
02:19:15,280 --> 02:19:17,270
to some of my friends who haven't
survived obviously who haven't survived

8044
02:19:17,270 --> 02:19:17,280
survived obviously who haven't survived
 

8045
02:19:17,280 --> 02:19:20,150
survived obviously who haven't survived
depression like mine was definitely not

8046
02:19:20,150 --> 02:19:20,160
depression like mine was definitely not
 

8047
02:19:20,160 --> 02:19:23,110
depression like mine was definitely not
whatever theirs was like it i've heard

8048
02:19:23,110 --> 02:19:23,120
whatever theirs was like it i've heard
 

8049
02:19:23,120 --> 02:19:24,309
whatever theirs was like it i've heard
uh

8050
02:19:24,309 --> 02:19:24,319
uh
 

8051
02:19:24,319 --> 02:19:25,990
uh
i mean to understand it for folks out

8052
02:19:25,990 --> 02:19:26,000
i mean to understand it for folks out
 

8053
02:19:26,000 --> 02:19:27,110
i mean to understand it for folks out
there maybe you haven't gone through it

8054
02:19:27,110 --> 02:19:27,120
there maybe you haven't gone through it
 

8055
02:19:27,120 --> 02:19:28,389
there maybe you haven't gone through it
just imagine

8056
02:19:28,389 --> 02:19:28,399
just imagine
 

8057
02:19:28,399 --> 02:19:30,950
just imagine
if like how bad you have to feel if

8058
02:19:30,950 --> 02:19:30,960
if like how bad you have to feel if
 

8059
02:19:30,960 --> 02:19:33,270
if like how bad you have to feel if
death is the salute like

8060
02:19:33,270 --> 02:19:33,280
death is the salute like
 

8061
02:19:33,280 --> 02:19:35,349
death is the salute like
like violence against yourself so that

8062
02:19:35,349 --> 02:19:35,359
like violence against yourself so that
 

8063
02:19:35,359 --> 02:19:40,469
like violence against yourself so that
you die is the solution like just

8064
02:19:40,469 --> 02:19:40,479

 

8065
02:19:40,479 --> 02:19:42,950

it flies in the face of everything

8066
02:19:42,950 --> 02:19:42,960
it flies in the face of everything
 

8067
02:19:42,960 --> 02:19:45,910
it flies in the face of everything
so i i would yeah that was definitely

8068
02:19:45,910 --> 02:19:45,920
so i i would yeah that was definitely
 

8069
02:19:45,920 --> 02:19:47,349
so i i would yeah that was definitely
the darkest

8070
02:19:47,349 --> 02:19:47,359
the darkest
 

8071
02:19:47,359 --> 02:19:49,110
the darkest
place that i've ever been is it just

8072
02:19:49,110 --> 02:19:49,120
place that i've ever been is it just
 

8073
02:19:49,120 --> 02:19:51,429
place that i've ever been is it just
that death doesn't seem like

8074
02:19:51,429 --> 02:19:51,439
that death doesn't seem like
 

8075
02:19:51,439 --> 02:19:53,110
that death doesn't seem like
because you don't care about anything

8076
02:19:53,110 --> 02:19:53,120
because you don't care about anything
 

8077
02:19:53,120 --> 02:19:55,190
because you don't care about anything
anymore that death just doesn't seem

8078
02:19:55,190 --> 02:19:55,200
anymore that death just doesn't seem
 

8079
02:19:55,200 --> 02:19:57,190
anymore that death just doesn't seem
like that bad yeah

8080
02:19:57,190 --> 02:19:57,200
like that bad yeah
 

8081
02:19:57,200 --> 02:19:58,309
like that bad yeah
um

8082
02:19:58,309 --> 02:19:58,319
um
 

8083
02:19:58,319 --> 02:20:00,469
um
like you're not able to appropriately

8084
02:20:00,469 --> 02:20:00,479
like you're not able to appropriately
 

8085
02:20:00,479 --> 02:20:02,630
like you're not able to appropriately
assign

8086
02:20:02,630 --> 02:20:02,640
assign
 

8087
02:20:02,640 --> 02:20:05,510
assign
the negative cost to this the solution

8088
02:20:05,510 --> 02:20:05,520
the negative cost to this the solution
 

8089
02:20:05,520 --> 02:20:06,950
the negative cost to this the solution
right just seems like a reasonable

8090
02:20:06,950 --> 02:20:06,960
right just seems like a reasonable
 

8091
02:20:06,960 --> 02:20:10,150
right just seems like a reasonable
solution yeah and but in in in and but i

8092
02:20:10,150 --> 02:20:10,160
solution yeah and but in in in and but i
 

8093
02:20:10,160 --> 02:20:11,910
solution yeah and but in in in and but i
think also what's going along with it is

8094
02:20:11,910 --> 02:20:11,920
think also what's going along with it is
 

8095
02:20:11,920 --> 02:20:12,870
think also what's going along with it is
like

8096
02:20:12,870 --> 02:20:12,880
like
 

8097
02:20:12,880 --> 02:20:14,630

you know you're like it invites you to

8142
02:20:56,870 --> 02:20:56,880
you know you're like it invites you to
 

8143

8245
02:22:50,000 --> 02:22:53,270

and i feel like in retrospect i'm making

8246
02:22:53,270 --> 02:22:53,280
and i feel like in retrospect i'm making
 

8247
02:22:53,280 --> 02:22:55,990
and i feel like in retrospect i'm making
what i what i've done a little like i

8248
02:22:55,990 --> 02:22:56,000
what i what i've done a little like i
 

8249
02:22:56,000 --> 02:22:58,630

had more lucidity it was more of like a

8250
02:22:58,630 --> 02:22:58,640
had more lucidity it was more of like a
 

8251
02:22:58,640 --> 02:22:59,990
had more lucidity it was more of like a
when you're

8252
02:22:59,990 --> 02:23:00,000
when you're
 

8253
02:23:00,000 --> 02:23:01,830
when you're
uh right you know you're wrestling with

8254
02:23:01,830 --> 02:23:01,840
uh right you know you're wrestling with
 

8255
02:23:01,840 --> 02:23:05,590
uh right you know you're wrestling with
someone and you're just like well you do

8256
02:23:05,590 --> 02:23:05,600
someone and you're just like well you do
 

8257
02:23:05,600 --> 02:23:07,349
someone and you're just like well you do
yes it's different for you but for me if

8258
02:23:07,349 --> 02:23:07,359
yes it's different for you but for me if
 

8259
02:23:07,359 --> 02:23:09,270
yes it's different for you but for me if
i'm wrestling i'm not thinking about jiu

8260
02:23:09,270 --> 02:23:09,280
i'm wrestling i'm not thinking about jiu
 

8261
02:23:09,280 --> 02:23:11,910
i'm wrestling i'm not thinking about jiu
jitsu moves i'm like survival

8262
02:23:11,910 --> 02:23:11,920
jitsu moves i'm like survival
 

8263
02:23:11,920 --> 02:23:14,790
jitsu moves i'm like survival
so it's like that it is a struggle

8264
02:23:14,790 --> 02:23:14,800
so it's like that it is a struggle
 

8265
02:23:14,800 --> 02:23:17,590
so it's like that it is a struggle
like it's like uh you really

8266
02:23:17,590 --> 02:23:17,600
like it's like uh you really
 

8267
02:23:17,600 --> 02:23:19,429
like it's like uh you really
have to deliberately

8268
02:23:19,429 --> 02:23:19,439
have to deliberately
 

8269
02:23:19,439 --> 02:23:22,309
have to deliberately
yeah fight everything so

8270
02:23:22,309 --> 02:23:22,319
yeah fight everything so
 

8271
02:23:22,319 --> 02:23:23,110
yeah fight everything so
you

8272
02:23:23,110 --> 02:23:23,120
you
 

8273
02:23:23,120 --> 02:23:24,710
you
start so you can almost have a

8274
02:23:24,710 --> 02:23:24,720
start so you can almost have a
 

8275
02:23:24,720 --> 02:23:27,429
start so you can almost have a
conversation with the depression

8276
02:23:27,429 --> 02:23:27,439
conversation with the depression
 

8277
02:23:27,439 --> 02:23:29,270
conversation with the depression
and then what you do is you start doing

8278
02:23:29,270 --> 02:23:29,280
and then what you do is you start doing
 

8279
02:23:29,280 --> 02:23:30,710
and then what you do is you start doing
the opposite

8280
02:23:30,710 --> 02:23:30,720
the opposite
 

8281
02:23:30,720 --> 02:23:33,190
the opposite
of everything it's telling you to do

8282
02:23:33,190 --> 02:23:33,200
of everything it's telling you to do
 

8283
02:23:33,200 --> 02:23:35,030
of everything it's telling you to do
so it's telling you

8284
02:23:35,030 --> 02:23:35,040
so it's telling you
 

8285
02:23:35,040 --> 02:23:36,469
so it's telling you
lay in bed

8286
02:23:36,469 --> 02:23:36,479
lay in bed
 

8287
02:23:36,479 --> 02:23:38,150
lay in bed
so you get out of bed

8288
02:23:38,150 --> 02:23:38,160
so you get out of bed
 

8289
02:23:38,160 --> 02:23:40,309
so you get out of bed
it's definitely telling you don't

8290
02:23:40,309 --> 02:23:40,319
it's definitely telling you don't
 

8291
02:23:40,319 --> 02:23:42,469
it's definitely telling you don't

something works
exactly it's a survival issue and it's a

8572
02:28:20,070 --> 02:28:20,080
exactly it's a survival issue and it's a
 

8573
02:28:20,080 --> 02:28:21,910
exactly it's a survival issue and it's a
survival issue it's just i think because

it's the same thing that people on the

sending missiles into other tanks
they're thinking the same thing it's

9176
02:38:39,110 --> 02:38:39,120
they're thinking the same thing it's
 

9177
02:38:39,120 --> 02:38:42,150
they're thinking the same thing it's
just they're more directly responsible

9178
02:38:42,150 --> 02:38:42,160
just they're more directly responsible
 

9179
02:38:42,160 --> 02:38:44,550
just they're more directly responsible
for what's going on but in

in buddhism this idea of dependent
 

9183
02:38:46,960 --> 02:38:49,990

part of this matrix we're all connected
meaning

9190
02:38:55,510 --> 02:38:55,520
meaning
 

9191
02:38:55,520 --> 02:38:58,070
meaning
we all share responsibility for the evil

9192
02:38:58,070 --> 02:38:58,080
we all share responsibility for the evil
 

9193
02:38:58,080 --> 02:39:00,630
we all share responsibility for the evil
in the world so even if you aren't

9194
02:39:00,630 --> 02:39:00,640
in the world so even if you aren't
 

9195
02:39:00,640 --> 02:39:03,750
in the world so even if you aren't
directly committing evil acts if you're

9196
02:39:03,750 --> 02:39:03,760
directly committing evil acts if you're
 

9197
02:39:03,760 --> 02:39:05,830
directly committing evil acts if you're
seeing something in the world and you're

9198
02:39:05,830 --> 02:39:05,840
seeing something in the world and you're
 

9199
02:39:05,840 --> 02:39:08,150
seeing something in the world and you're
thinking that's evil

9200
02:39:08,150 --> 02:39:08,160
thinking that's evil
 

9201
02:39:08,160 --> 02:39:10,070
thinking that's evil
you're probably not quite as separated

9202
02:39:10,070 --> 02:39:10,080
you're probably not quite as separated
 

9203
02:39:10,080 --> 02:39:11,910
you're probably not quite as separated
from that as you'd like to believe in

9204
02:39:11,910 --> 02:39:11,920
from that as you'd like to believe in
 

9205
02:39:11,920 --> 02:39:13,110
from that as you'd like to believe in
some

tiny infinitesimally
 

9209
02:39:16,080 --> 02:39:19,270
tiny infinitesimally
quantum way you you're connected so and

9210
02:39:19,270 --> 02:39:19,280
quantum way you you're connected so and
 

9211
02:39:19,280 --> 02:39:20,950
quantum way you you're connected so and
there's a sense

9212
02:39:20,950 --> 02:39:20,960
there's a sense
 

9213
02:39:20,960 --> 02:39:23,110
there's a sense
i've gotten to experience this

9214
02:39:23,110 --> 02:39:23,120
i've gotten to experience this
 

9215
02:39:23,120 --> 02:39:25,270
i've gotten to experience this
over and over that one individual can

9216
02:39:25,270 --> 02:39:25,280
over and over that one individual can
 

9217
02:39:25,280 --> 02:39:28,150
over and over that one individual can
actually make a gigantic difference

9218
02:39:28,150 --> 02:39:28,160
actually make a gigantic difference
 

9219
02:39:28,160 --> 02:39:29,190
actually make a gigantic difference

in
 

9221
02:39:29,200 --> 02:39:31,750

and so not only is there a diffusion

9222
02:39:31,750 --> 02:39:31,760
and so not only is there a diffusion
 

9223
02:39:31,760 --> 02:39:33,270
and so not only is there a diffusion
responsibility

9224
02:39:33,270 --> 02:39:33,280
responsibility
 

9225
02:39:33,280 --> 02:39:35,670
responsibility
there's a kind of uh paralysis about

9226
02:39:35,670 --> 02:39:35,680
there's a kind of uh paralysis about
 

9227
02:39:35,680 --> 02:39:38,550
there's a kind of uh paralysis about
well what can i do yeah

9228
02:39:38,550 --> 02:39:38,560
well what can i do yeah
 

9229
02:39:38,560 --> 02:39:41,030
well what can i do yeah
sure i understand but what can i do and

9230
02:39:41,030 --> 02:39:41,040
sure i understand but what can i do and
 

9231
02:39:41,040 --> 02:39:42,870
sure i understand but what can i do and
i think

9232
02:39:42,870 --> 02:39:42,880
i think
 

9233
02:39:42,880 --> 02:39:43,590
i think
just

9234
02:39:43,590 --> 02:39:43,600
just
 

9235
02:39:43,600 --> 02:39:46,070
just
looking at history

9236
02:39:46,070 --> 02:39:46,080
looking at history
 

9237
02:39:46,080 --> 02:39:49,110

people that have had a tremendous impact

9242

people that have had a tremendous impact
 

9243
02:39:52,800 --> 02:39:53,750
people that have had a tremendous impact
you realize

9244
02:39:53,750 --> 02:39:53,760
you realize
 

9245

it's been a bit because of the pandemic

9768
02:48:55,429 --> 02:48:55,439
it's been a bit because of the pandemic
 

9769
02:48:55,439 --> 02:48:56,309
it's been a bit because of the pandemic
but

9770
02:48:56,309 --> 02:48:56,319
but
 

9771
02:48:56,319 --> 02:48:58,070
but
the only thing you could buy was ice and

9772
02:48:58,070 --> 02:48:58,080
the only thing you could buy was ice and
 

9773

not to mention the insane

10290
02:57:45,429 --> 02:57:45,439
not to mention the insane
 

10291
02:57:45,439 --> 02:57:47,110
not to mention the insane
synchronicities like

10292
02:57:47,110 --> 02:57:47,120
synchronicities like
 

10293
02:57:47,120 --> 02:57:49,190
synchronicities like
insane synchronicities here and i think

10294
02:57:49,190 --> 02:57:49,200
insane synchronicities here and i think
 

10295
02:57:49,200 --> 02:57:51,590
insane synchronicities here and i think
like you know to get back to the notion

10296
02:57:51,590 --> 02:57:51,600
like you know to get back to the notion
 

10297
02:57:51,600 --> 02:57:53,190
like you know to get back to the notion
of sentience as a

10298
02:57:53,190 --> 02:57:53,200
of sentience as a
 

10299
02:57:53,200 --> 02:57:55,510
of sentience as a
byproduct of uh

10300
02:57:55,510 --> 02:57:55,520
byproduct of uh
 

10301
02:57:55,520 --> 02:57:59,670
byproduct of uh
a harmonized yet hyper-complex system um

10302
02:57:59,670 --> 02:57:59,680
a harmonized yet hyper-complex system um
 

10303
02:57:59,680 --> 02:58:01,830
a harmonized yet hyper-complex system um
see i think synchronicities like

10304
02:58:01,830 --> 02:58:01,840
see i think synchronicities like
 

10305
02:58:01,840 --> 02:58:03,349
see i think synchronicities like
like those kinds of systems are like

10306
02:58:03,349 --> 02:58:03,359
like those kinds of systems are like
 

10307
02:58:03,359 --> 02:58:06,230
like those kinds of systems are like
lightning rods for synchronicity so

10308
02:58:06,230 --> 02:58:06,240
lightning rods for synchronicity so
 

10309
02:58:06,240 --> 02:58:09,510
lightning rods for synchronicity so
cr crazy not just because your high

10310

cr crazy not just because your high
 

10311
02:58:09,520 --> 02:58:10,950
cr crazy not just because your high
synchronicities

10312
02:58:10,950 --> 02:58:10,960
synchronicities
 

10313
02:58:10,960 --> 02:58:13,110

sees her i'm like
so this is what i get like

10380
02:59:24,230 --> 02:59:24,240
so this is what i get like
 

10381
02:59:24,240 --> 02:59:26,389
so this is what i get like
a [\h__\h] cow with a lantern head like

10382
02:59:26,389 --> 02:59:26,399
a [\h__\h] cow with a lantern head like
 

10383
02:59:26,399 --> 02:59:28,469
a [\h__\h] cow with a lantern head like
that's where my brain is at and

10384
02:59:28,469 --> 02:59:28,479
that's where my brain is at and
 

10385
02:59:28,479 --> 02:59:30,630
that's where my brain is at and
interacting with this molecule

10386
02:59:30,630 --> 02:59:30,640
interacting with this molecule
 

10387
02:59:30,640 --> 02:59:33,590
interacting with this molecule
so then like

10388
02:59:33,590 --> 02:59:33,600
so then like
 

10389
02:59:33,600 --> 02:59:38,230
so then like
i look i look away

10390
02:59:38,230 --> 02:59:38,240

 

10391
02:59:38,240 --> 02:59:40,230

and again this is dmt so when i say look

10392
02:59:40,230 --> 02:59:40,240
and again this is dmt so when i say look
 

10393
02:59:40,240 --> 02:59:42,389
and again this is dmt so when i say look
away do i mean with my eyes shut i look

10394
02:59:42,389 --> 02:59:42,399
away do i mean with my eyes shut i look
 

10395
02:59:42,399 --> 02:59:44,630
away do i mean with my eyes shut i look
away our eyes open i look away i think i

10396
02:59:44,630 --> 02:59:44,640
away our eyes open i look away i think i
 

10397
02:59:44,640 --> 02:59:45,990
away our eyes open i look away i think i
shut

10398
02:59:45,990 --> 02:59:46,000
shut
 

10399
02:59:46,000 --> 02:59:49,030
shut
so it sounds weird to say look away but

10400
02:59:49,030 --> 02:59:49,040
so it sounds weird to say look away but
 

10401

02:59:51,840 --> 02:59:53,590

and out of time space but when you the
 

10567
03:02:40,560 --> 03:02:42,550
and out of time space but when you the
problem is when you go into time space

10568
03:02:42,550 --> 03:02:42,560
problem is when you go into time space
 

10569
03:02:42,560 --> 03:02:45,110
problem is when you go into time space
it's time so it's going to feel sticky

10579
03:02:53,520 --> 03:02:55,750
um and uh i guess one of the qualities
of dropping into that frame is that you

10580
03:02:55,750 --> 03:02:55,760
of dropping into that frame is that you
 

10581
03:02:55,760 --> 03:02:56,870
of dropping into that frame is that you
forget

10582

forget
 

10583
03:02:56,880 --> 03:02:58,389

mixes its way into the show but
 

10707
03:05:02,000 --> 03:05:03,750
mixes its way into the show but
one of the things

10708
03:05:03,750 --> 03:05:03,760
one of the things
 

10709
03:05:03,760 --> 03:05:05,349
one of the things
you know in

03:05:05,349 --> 03:05:05,359
you know in
 

10711
03:05:05,359 --> 03:05:06,950
you know in
animation

10712
03:05:06,950 --> 03:05:06,960
animation
 

10713
03:05:06,960 --> 03:05:10,070
animation
it can get really strict with like

10714
03:05:10,070 --> 03:05:10,080
it can get really strict with like
 

10715
03:05:10,080 --> 03:05:12,870
it can get really strict with like
drawing the characters and like

10716
03:05:12,870 --> 03:05:12,880
drawing the characters and like
 

10717
03:05:12,880 --> 03:05:13,750
drawing the characters and like
the

10718
03:05:13,750 --> 03:05:13,760
the
 

10719
03:05:13,760 --> 03:05:14,550
the
like

10720
03:05:14,550 --> 03:05:14,560
like
 

10721
03:05:14,560 --> 03:05:17,590
like
trying to create continuity in the way

10722
03:05:17,590 --> 03:05:17,600
trying to create continuity in the way
 

10723
03:05:17,600 --> 03:05:19,750
trying to create continuity in the way
the character looks like and it can get

10724
03:05:19,750 --> 03:05:19,760
the character looks like and it can get
 

10725
03:05:19,760 --> 03:05:22,070
the character looks like and it can get
really brute for the animator it can get

10726
03:05:22,070 --> 03:05:22,080
really brute for the animator it can get
 

10727
03:05:22,080 --> 03:05:23,110
really brute for the animator it can get
brutally

10728
03:05:23,110 --> 03:05:23,120
brutally
 

10729
03:05:23,120 --> 03:05:26,230
brutally
precise like it has to be precise

10730
03:05:26,230 --> 03:05:26,240
precise like it has to be precise
 

10731
03:05:26,240 --> 03:05:27,910
precise like it has to be precise
but he figured out that if you just sort

10732
03:05:27,910 --> 03:05:27,920
but he figured out that if you just sort
 

10733
03:05:27,920 --> 03:05:30,070
but he figured out that if you just sort
of

10734
03:05:30,070 --> 03:05:30,080

 

10735
03:05:30,080 --> 03:05:32,230

it's not like obviously like clancy had

10736
03:05:32,230 --> 03:05:32,240
it's not like obviously like clancy had
 

10737
03:05:32,240 --> 03:05:33,670
it's not like obviously like clancy had
to look like clancy through the whole

10738
03:05:33,670 --> 03:05:33,680
to look like clancy through the whole
 

10739
03:05:33,680 --> 03:05:35,750
to look like clancy through the whole
show but if you allow the various people

10740
03:05:35,750 --> 03:05:35,760
show but if you allow the various people
 

10741
03:05:35,760 --> 03:05:37,990
show but if you allow the various people
animating it to sort of have their own

10742
03:05:37,990 --> 03:05:38,000
animating it to sort of have their own
 

10743
03:05:38,000 --> 03:05:40,870
animating it to sort of have their own
spin on it then suddenly it creates a

10744
03:05:40,870 --> 03:05:40,880
spin on it then suddenly it creates a
 

10745
03:05:40,880 --> 03:05:42,550
spin on it then suddenly it creates a
very psychedelic

10746
03:05:42,550 --> 03:05:42,560
very psychedelic
 

10747
03:05:42,560 --> 03:05:44,950
very psychedelic
you know the show looks more psychedelic

10748
03:05:44,950 --> 03:05:44,960
you know the show looks more psychedelic
 

10749
03:05:44,960 --> 03:05:46,469
you know the show looks more psychedelic
because it looks more organic and also

10750
03:05:46,469 --> 03:05:46,479
because it looks more organic and also
 

10751
03:05:46,479 --> 03:05:48,070
because it looks more organic and also
the amount of time

10752
03:05:48,070 --> 03:05:48,080
the amount of time
 

10753
03:05:48,080 --> 03:05:50,550
the amount of time
i had no idea the amount of time that

10754
03:05:50,550 --> 03:05:50,560
i had no idea the amount of time that
 

10755
03:05:50,560 --> 03:05:51,830
i had no idea the amount of time that
goes into

10756
03:05:51,830 --> 03:05:51,840
goes into
 

10757
03:05:51,840 --> 03:05:53,190
goes into
making

10758
03:05:53,190 --> 03:05:53,200
making
 

10759
03:05:53,200 --> 03:05:55,349
making
digital art

10760
03:05:55,349 --> 03:05:55,359
digital art
 

10761
03:05:55,359 --> 03:05:57,910
digital art
look like that is it's

10762
03:05:57,910 --> 03:05:57,920
look like that is it's
 

10763
03:05:57,920 --> 03:06:01,030
look like that is it's
insane the amount of work and comping

10764
03:06:01,030 --> 03:06:01,040
insane the amount of work and comping
 

10765
03:06:01,040 --> 03:06:03,190
insane the amount of work and comping
that stuff is just

10766
03:06:03,190 --> 03:06:03,200
that stuff is just
 

10767
03:06:03,200 --> 03:06:05,429
that stuff is just
crazy it's crazy well generally the

10768
03:06:05,429 --> 03:06:05,439
crazy it's crazy well generally the
 

10769
03:06:05,439 --> 03:06:07,269
crazy it's crazy well generally the
amount of time it takes

10770
03:06:07,269 --> 03:06:07,279
amount of time it takes
 

10771
03:06:07,279 --> 03:06:09,269
amount of time it takes
even just like a painting

10772
03:06:09,269 --> 03:06:09,279
even just like a painting
 

10773
03:06:09,279 --> 03:06:11,349
even just like a painting
when you uh i really enjoy watching like

10774
03:06:11,349 --> 03:06:11,359
when you uh i really enjoy watching like
 

10775
03:06:11,359 --> 03:06:13,670
when you uh i really enjoy watching like
artists do a time lapse and you realize

10776
03:06:13,670 --> 03:06:13,680
artists do a time lapse and you realize
 

10777
03:06:13,680 --> 03:06:16,550
artists do a time lapse and you realize
how much effort just into a single

10778
03:06:16,550 --> 03:06:16,560
how much effort just into a single
 

10779
03:06:16,560 --> 03:06:17,670
how much effort just into a single

image
 

10781
03:06:17,680 --> 03:06:19,910
image
goes into it you know hours and hours

10782
03:06:19,910 --> 03:06:19,920
goes into it you know hours and hours
 

10783
03:06:19,920 --> 03:06:21,990
goes into it you know hours and hours
and hours sometimes days sometimes weeks

10784
03:06:21,990 --> 03:06:22,000
and hours sometimes days sometimes weeks
 

10785
03:06:22,000 --> 03:06:23,990
and hours sometimes days sometimes weeks
and months nuts and then you just get to

10786
03:06:23,990 --> 03:06:24,000
and months nuts and then you just get to
 

10787
03:06:24,000 --> 03:06:25,910
and months nuts and then you just get to
see them work but they they they lose

10788
03:06:25,910 --> 03:06:25,920
see them work but they they they lose
 

10789
03:06:25,920 --> 03:06:28,309
see them work but they they they lose
themselves in the craftsmanship of it

10790
03:06:28,309 --> 03:06:28,319
themselves in the craftsmanship of it
 

10791
03:06:28,319 --> 03:06:30,309
themselves in the craftsmanship of it
and the the rhythm of it

10792
03:06:30,309 --> 03:06:30,319
and the the rhythm of it
 

10793
03:06:30,319 --> 03:06:32,550
and the the rhythm of it
and like because they're focused on the

10794
03:06:32,550 --> 03:06:32,560
and like because they're focused on the
 

10795
03:06:32,560 --> 03:06:34,389
and like because they're focused on the
so we're talking about robotics earlier

10796
03:06:34,389 --> 03:06:34,399
so we're talking about robotics earlier
 

10797
03:06:34,399 --> 03:06:36,309
so we're talking about robotics earlier
like on the little details like they're

10798
03:06:36,309 --> 03:06:36,319
like on the little details like they're
 

10799
03:06:36,319 --> 03:06:38,309
like on the little details like they're
never look well

10800
03:06:38,309 --> 03:06:38,319
never look well
 

10801
03:06:38,319 --> 03:06:39,990
never look well
most of the time isn't spent looking at

10802
03:06:39,990 --> 03:06:40,000
most of the time isn't spent looking at
 

10803
03:06:40,000 --> 03:06:41,750
most of the time isn't spent looking at
the big picture of the final result it's

10804
03:06:41,750 --> 03:06:41,760
the big picture of the final result it's
 

10805
03:06:41,760 --> 03:06:43,349
the big picture of the final result it's
looking at the little details yeah and

final result my god yeah yeah the
 

10815
03:06:52,000 --> 03:06:55,110
final result my god yeah yeah the
respect i have for animators it's like

10816
03:06:55,110 --> 03:06:55,120
respect i have for animators it's like
 

10817
03:06:55,120 --> 03:06:58,550
respect i have for animators it's like

03:11:53,359 --> 03:11:55,990
the neophyte phase of whatever the art
form is and you know some intermediary

phase then i think a lot more people
 

11107
03:11:57,920 --> 03:11:59,349
phase then i think a lot more people
would do it but

would do it but
 

11109
03:11:59,359 --> 03:12:01,510
