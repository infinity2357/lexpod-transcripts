if I couldn't remember that far back
 

213
00:04:37,530 --> 00:04:41,090
if I couldn't remember that far back
well it was some while ago um so I think

214
00:04:41,090 --> 00:04:41,100
well it was some while ago um so I think
 

215
00:04:41,100 --> 00:04:44,030
well it was some while ago um so I think
the gist of it is that at Bell Labs and

the gist of it is that at Bell Labs and
 

217
00:04:44,040 --> 00:04:46,880
the gist of it is that at Bell Labs and
in 1969 there were a group of people who

in 1969 there were a group of people who
 

219
00:04:46,890 --> 00:04:49,400
in 1969 there were a group of people who
had just finished working on the multics

CTS s so we can go back sort of an

00:04:55,820 --> 00:04:55,830
CTS s so we can go back sort of an
 

225
00:04:55,830 --> 00:04:58,760
CTS s so we can go back sort of an
infinite regress in time but the CTS s

227
00:04:58,770 --> 00:05:00,620
infinite regress in time but the CTS s
was a very very very nice time sharing

228
00:05:00,620 --> 00:05:00,630
was a very very very nice time sharing
 

229
00:05:00,630 --> 00:05:02,330
was a very very very nice time sharing
system was very nice to use I actually

230
00:05:02,330 --> 00:05:02,340
system was very nice to use I actually
 

231
00:05:02,340 --> 00:05:04,700
system was very nice to use I actually
used it as that summer I spent in

00:05:04,700 --> 00:05:04,710
used it as that summer I spent in

Cambridge in 1966 for was the hardware

235
00:05:07,740 --> 00:05:09,290
Cambridge in 1966 for was the hardware
there right so what's the operating

the CTS look like so cts s looked like

240
00:05:13,480 --> 00:05:13,490
the CTS look like so cts s looked like
 

241
00:05:13,490 --> 00:05:16,400
the CTS look like so cts s looked like
kind of like a standard time sharing

242
00:05:16,400 --> 00:05:16,410
kind of like a standard time sharing
 

243
00:05:16,410 --> 00:05:18,110
kind of like a standard time sharing
system certainly at the time it was the

system certainly at the time it was the
 

245
00:05:18,120 --> 00:05:20,300

only time sharing if no let's go back to

only time sharing if no let's go back to
 

247
00:05:20,310 --> 00:05:23,360
only time sharing if no let's go back to
the basic ok in the beginning was the

248
00:05:23,360 --> 00:05:23,370
the basic ok in the beginning was the
 

249
00:05:23,370 --> 00:05:25,580
the basic ok in the beginning was the
word and the word sign there was time

250
00:05:25,580 --> 00:05:25,590
word and the word sign there was time
 

251
00:05:25,590 --> 00:05:28,100
word and the word sign there was time
sharing systems yeah if we go back into

252
00:05:28,100 --> 00:05:28,110
sharing systems yeah if we go back into
 

253
00:05:28,110 --> 00:05:31,240
sharing systems yeah if we go back into
let's call it the 1950s and early 1960s

254
00:05:31,240 --> 00:05:31,250
let's call it the 1950s and early 1960s

let's call it the 1950s and early 1960s
most computing was done on very big

00:05:33,890 --> 00:05:33,900
most computing was done on very big
 

257
00:05:33,900 --> 00:05:36,080
most computing was done on very big

that were maintained in very large rooms

262
00:05:41,900 --> 00:05:41,910
that were maintained in very large rooms
 

263
00:05:41,910 --> 00:05:45,860
that were maintained in very large rooms
and you used things like punch cards to

264
00:05:45,860 --> 00:05:45,870
and you used things like punch cards to
 

265
00:05:45,870 --> 00:05:47,600
and you used things like punch cards to
write programs on talk to him so you

266
00:05:47,600 --> 00:05:47,610
write programs on talk to him so you
 

267
00:05:47,610 --> 00:05:49,580
write programs on talk to him so you
would take a deck of cards write your

268
00:05:49,580 --> 00:05:49,590
would take a deck of cards write your
 

269
00:05:49,590 --> 00:05:51,680
would take a deck of cards write your
program on it send it over a counter

270
00:05:51,680 --> 00:05:51,690
program on it send it over a counter
 

271
00:05:51,690 --> 00:05:53,870
program on it send it over a counter
hand it to an operator and some while

272
00:05:53,870 --> 00:05:53,880
hand it to an operator and some while

00:05:53,880 --> 00:05:55,550
hand it to an operator and some while
later back would come something that

274
00:05:55,550 --> 00:05:55,560
later back would come something that
 

275
00:05:55,560 --> 00:05:57,230
later back would come something that
said oh you made a mistake and then

276
00:05:57,230 --> 00:05:57,240
said oh you made a mistake and then
 

277
00:05:57,240 --> 00:05:58,850
said oh you made a mistake and then
you'd recycle and so it's very very slow

278
00:05:58,850 --> 00:05:58,860
you'd recycle and so it's very very slow
 

279
00:05:58,860 --> 00:06:01,220
you'd recycle and so it's very very slow
so the idea of time sharing was that you

280
00:06:01,220 --> 00:06:01,230
so the idea of time sharing was that you
 

281
00:06:01,230 --> 00:06:04,480
so the idea of time sharing was that you
take basically that same computer but

282
00:06:04,480 --> 00:06:04,490
take basically that same computer but
 

283
00:06:04,490 --> 00:06:07,310
take basically that same computer but
connect to it with something that looked

284
00:06:07,310 --> 00:06:07,320
connect to it with something that looked
 

285
00:06:07,320 --> 00:06:09,770
connect to it with something that looked
like an electric typewriter they could

286
00:06:09,770 --> 00:06:09,780
like an electric typewriter they could
 

287
00:06:09,780 --> 00:06:11,210
like an electric typewriter they could
be a long distance away it could be

288
00:06:11,210 --> 00:06:11,220
be a long distance away it could be
 

289
00:06:11,220 --> 00:06:13,010
be a long distance away it could be
closed but fundamentally what the

290
00:06:13,010 --> 00:06:13,020
closed but fundamentally what the
 

291
00:06:13,020 --> 00:06:16,340
closed but fundamentally what the
operating system did was to give each

292
00:06:16,340 --> 00:06:16,350
operating system did was to give each
 

293
00:06:16,350 --> 00:06:18,200
operating system did was to give each
person who was connected to it and

294
00:06:18,200 --> 00:06:18,210
person who was connected to it and
 

295
00:06:18,210 --> 00:06:20,600
person who was connected to it and
wanting to do something a small slice of

296
00:06:20,600 --> 00:06:20,610
wanting to do something a small slice of
 

297
00:06:20,610 --> 00:06:24,980
wanting to do something a small slice of
time on to do a particular job so I

298
00:06:24,980 --> 00:06:24,990
time on to do a particular job so I
 

299
00:06:24,990 --> 00:06:27,140
time on to do a particular job so I
might be editing a file so I would be

300
00:06:27,140 --> 00:06:27,150
might be editing a file so I would be
 

301
00:06:27,150 --> 00:06:29,300
might be editing a file so I would be
typing and every time I hit a keystroke

302
00:06:29,300 --> 00:06:29,310
typing and every time I hit a keystroke
 

303
00:06:29,310 --> 00:06:30,770
typing and every time I hit a keystroke
the operating system would wake up and

304
00:06:30,770 --> 00:06:30,780
the operating system would wake up and
 

305
00:06:30,780 --> 00:06:32,390
the operating system would wake up and
said oh he typed character let me

306
00:06:32,390 --> 00:06:32,400
said oh he typed character let me
 

307
00:06:32,400 --> 00:06:34,010
said oh he typed character let me
remember that and then it go back to

308
00:06:34,010 --> 00:06:34,020
remember that and then it go back to
 

309
00:06:34,020 --> 00:06:35,390
remember that and then it go back to
doing something else would be going

310
00:06:35,390 --> 00:06:35,400
doing something else would be going
 

311
00:06:35,400 --> 00:06:37,870
doing something else would be going
around and around a group of

00:06:37,870 --> 00:06:37,880
around and around a group of
 

313
00:06:37,880 --> 00:06:39,130
around and around a group of
who were trying to get something done

314
00:06:39,130 --> 00:06:39,140
who were trying to get something done
 

315
00:06:39,140 --> 00:06:42,780
who were trying to get something done
giving each a small slice of time and

316
00:06:42,780 --> 00:06:42,790
giving each a small slice of time and
 

317
00:06:42,790 --> 00:06:45,370
giving each a small slice of time and
giving them each the illusion that they

00:06:45,370 --> 00:06:45,380
giving them each the illusion that they
 

319
00:06:45,380 --> 00:06:46,960
giving them each the illusion that they
pretty much hit the whole machine to

320
00:06:46,960 --> 00:06:46,970
pretty much hit the whole machine to
 

321
00:06:46,970 --> 00:06:49,330
pretty much hit the whole machine to
themselves and hence time sharing that

322
00:06:49,330 --> 00:06:49,340
themselves and hence time sharing that
 

323
00:06:49,340 --> 00:06:51,700
themselves and hence time sharing that
is sharing the computing time resource

324
00:06:51,700 --> 00:06:51,710
is sharing the computing time resource
 

325
00:06:51,710 --> 00:06:53,950
is sharing the computing time resource
of the computer among a number of people

326
00:06:53,950 --> 00:06:53,960
of the computer among a number of people
 

327
00:06:53,960 --> 00:06:55,840
of the computer among a number of people
who are doing it without the individual

328
00:06:55,840 --> 00:06:55,850
who are doing it without the individual
 

329
00:06:55,850 --> 00:06:57,580
who are doing it without the individual
people being aware that there's others

330
00:06:57,580 --> 00:06:57,590
people being aware that there's others
 

331
00:06:57,590 --> 00:06:59,860
people being aware that there's others
in a sense the illusion the feeling is

332
00:06:59,860 --> 00:06:59,870
in a sense the illusion the feeling is
 

333
00:06:59,870 --> 00:07:02,710
in a sense the illusion the feeling is
that you the machine is your own pretty

334
00:07:02,710 --> 00:07:02,720
that you the machine is your own pretty
 

335
00:07:02,720 --> 00:07:05,260
that you the machine is your own pretty
much that was the idea yes you had if it

336
00:07:05,260 --> 00:07:05,270
much that was the idea yes you had if it
 

337
00:07:05,270 --> 00:07:07,630
much that was the idea yes you had if it
were well done and if it were fast

338
00:07:07,630 --> 00:07:07,640
were well done and if it were fast
 

339
00:07:07,640 --> 00:07:09,220
were well done and if it were fast
enough and other people were doing too

340
00:07:09,220 --> 00:07:09,230
enough and other people were doing too
 

341
00:07:09,230 --> 00:07:11,380
enough and other people were doing too
much you did have the illusion that you

342
00:07:11,380 --> 00:07:11,390
much you did have the illusion that you
 

343
00:07:11,390 --> 00:07:13,210
much you did have the illusion that you
had the whole machine to yourself and it

344
00:07:13,210 --> 00:07:13,220
had the whole machine to yourself and it
 

345
00:07:13,220 --> 00:07:15,730
had the whole machine to yourself and it
was very much better than the punch card

346
00:07:15,730 --> 00:07:15,740
was very much better than the punch card
 

347
00:07:15,740 --> 00:07:18,610
was very much better than the punch card
model and so cts s the compatible time

348
00:07:18,610 --> 00:07:18,620
model and so cts s the compatible time
 

349
00:07:18,620 --> 00:07:21,430
model and so cts s the compatible time
sharing system was I think arguably the

350
00:07:21,430 --> 00:07:21,440
sharing system was I think arguably the
 

351
00:07:21,440 --> 00:07:23,620
sharing system was I think arguably the
first of these it was done I guess

352
00:07:23,620 --> 00:07:23,630
first of these it was done I guess
 

353
00:07:23,630 --> 00:07:26,530
first of these it was done I guess
technically 64 or something like that it

354
00:07:26,530 --> 00:07:26,540
technically 64 or something like that it
 

355
00:07:26,540 --> 00:07:29,980
technically 64 or something like that it

358
00:07:32,200 --> 00:07:32,210
to have twice as much memory as the norm
 

359
00:07:32,210 --> 00:07:36,400
to have twice as much memory as the norm
it had two banks of 32 k words instead

360
00:07:36,400 --> 00:07:36,410
it had two banks of 32 k words instead
 

361
00:07:36,410 --> 00:07:41,890
it had two banks of 32 k words instead
of one so 32 K words yes where's this 36

362
00:07:41,890 --> 00:07:41,900
of one so 32 K words yes where's this 36
 

363
00:07:41,900 --> 00:07:43,480
of one so 32 K words yes where's this 36
bit so call it you know about a hundred

364
00:07:43,480 --> 00:07:43,490
bit so call it you know about a hundred
 

365
00:07:43,490 --> 00:07:47,080
bit so call it you know about a hundred
and fifty kilobytes times two so by

366
00:07:47,080 --> 00:07:47,090
and fifty kilobytes times two so by
 

367
00:07:47,090 --> 00:07:48,640
and fifty kilobytes times two so by
today's standards that's down in the

00:07:48,640 --> 00:07:48,650
today's standards that's down in the
 

369
00:07:48,650 --> 00:07:51,040
today's standards that's down in the
noise yeah at the time that was a lot of

370
00:07:51,040 --> 00:07:51,050
noise yeah at the time that was a lot of
 

371
00:07:51,050 --> 00:07:54,430
noise yeah at the time that was a lot of
memory and memory was expensive so C TSS

00:07:54,430 --> 00:07:54,440
memory and memory was expensive so C TSS
 

373
00:07:54,440 --> 00:07:56,620
memory and memory was expensive so C TSS
was just a wonderful environment to work

374
00:07:56,620 --> 00:07:56,630
was just a wonderful environment to work

00:08:07,300 --> 00:08:07,310
bunch of other folks and then so I spent
 

383
00:08:07,310 --> 00:08:09,670

00:08:09,670 --> 00:08:09,680
the summer of 66 working on that had a
 

385
00:08:09,680 --> 00:08:12,040
the summer of 66 working on that had a
great time met a lot of really nice

00:08:12,040 --> 00:08:12,050
great time met a lot of really nice
 

387
00:08:12,050 --> 00:08:16,150
great time met a lot of really nice
people and indirectly knew of people at

00:08:19,510 --> 00:08:19,520
Bell Labs who were also working on a
 

391
00:08:19,520 --> 00:08:22,930
Bell Labs who were also working on a
follow-on to C TSS that was called

392
00:08:22,930 --> 00:08:22,940
follow-on to C TSS that was called
 

393
00:08:22,940 --> 00:08:25,630
follow-on to C TSS that was called
multics so multics was meant to be the

394
00:08:25,630 --> 00:08:25,640
multics so multics was meant to be the
 

395
00:08:25,640 --> 00:08:26,980
multics so multics was meant to be the
system that would do everything that C

00:08:26,980 --> 00:08:26,990
system that would do everything that C
 

397
00:08:26,990 --> 00:08:29,140
system that would do everything that C
TSS did but do it better for a larger

398
00:08:29,140 --> 00:08:29,150
TSS did but do it better for a larger
 

399
00:08:29,150 --> 00:08:31,570
TSS did but do it better for a larger
population that's all the usual stuff

00:08:31,570 --> 00:08:31,580
population that's all the usual stuff
 

401
00:08:31,580 --> 00:08:33,219

00:08:33,219 --> 00:08:33,229
now the actual time sharing the

00:08:33,229 --> 00:08:37,330
now the actual time sharing the
scheduling how much what's the algorithm

404
00:08:37,330 --> 00:08:37,340
scheduling how much what's the algorithm
 

405
00:08:37,340 --> 00:08:39,370
scheduling how much what's the algorithm
that performs the scheduling what's that

406
00:08:39,370 --> 00:08:39,380
that performs the scheduling what's that
 

407
00:08:39,380 --> 00:08:41,110
that performs the scheduling what's that
look like how much magic is there what

408
00:08:41,110 --> 00:08:41,120
look like how much magic is there what
 

409
00:08:41,120 --> 00:08:43,690
look like how much magic is there what
are the metrics how does it all work in

410
00:08:43,690 --> 00:08:43,700
are the metrics how does it all work in
 

411
00:08:43,700 --> 00:08:45,430
are the metrics how does it all work in
the beginning so the answers I don't

412
00:08:45,430 --> 00:08:45,440
the beginning so the answers I don't
 

413
00:08:45,440 --> 00:08:47,620
the beginning so the answers I don't
have a clue I think the basic idea was

414
00:08:47,620 --> 00:08:47,630
have a clue I think the basic idea was
 

415
00:08:47,630 --> 00:08:49,900
have a clue I think the basic idea was
nothing more than who all wants to get

416
00:08:49,900 --> 00:08:49,910
nothing more than who all wants to get
 

417
00:08:49,910 --> 00:08:51,730
nothing more than who all wants to get
something done suppose things are very

418
00:08:51,730 --> 00:08:51,740
something done suppose things are very
 

419
00:08:51,740 --> 00:08:54,430
something done suppose things are very
in the middle of the night then I get

420
00:08:54,430 --> 00:08:54,440
in the middle of the night then I get
 

421
00:08:54,440 --> 00:08:56,290
in the middle of the night then I get
all the time that I want suppose that

422
00:08:56,290 --> 00:08:56,300
all the time that I want suppose that
 

423
00:08:56,300 --> 00:08:57,970
all the time that I want suppose that
you and I are contending at high noon

424
00:08:57,970 --> 00:08:57,980
you and I are contending at high noon
 

425
00:08:57,980 --> 00:09:00,400
you and I are contending at high noon
for something like that then probably

426
00:09:00,400 --> 00:09:00,410
for something like that then probably
 

427
00:09:00,410 --> 00:09:02,199
for something like that then probably
the simplest algorithm is a round robin

428
00:09:02,199 --> 00:09:02,209
the simplest algorithm is a round robin
 

429
00:09:02,209 --> 00:09:03,850
the simplest algorithm is a round robin
one that gives you a bit of time gives

430
00:09:03,850 --> 00:09:03,860
one that gives you a bit of time gives
 

431
00:09:03,860 --> 00:09:05,949
one that gives you a bit of time gives
me a bit of time and then we could adapt

432
00:09:05,949 --> 00:09:05,959
me a bit of time and then we could adapt
 

433
00:09:05,959 --> 00:09:08,530
me a bit of time and then we could adapt
to that like what are you trying to do

434
00:09:08,530 --> 00:09:08,540
to that like what are you trying to do
 

435
00:09:08,540 --> 00:09:10,720
to that like what are you trying to do
are you text editing or are you

436
00:09:10,720 --> 00:09:10,730
are you text editing or are you
 

437
00:09:10,730 --> 00:09:12,460
are you text editing or are you
compiling or something and we might

438
00:09:12,460 --> 00:09:12,470
compiling or something and we might
 

439
00:09:12,470 --> 00:09:14,530
compiling or something and we might
adjust the scheduler according to things

440
00:09:14,530 --> 00:09:14,540
adjust the scheduler according to things
 

441
00:09:14,540 --> 00:09:16,120
adjust the scheduler according to things
like that so okay so multics

442
00:09:16,120 --> 00:09:16,130
like that so okay so multics
 

443
00:09:16,130 --> 00:09:19,150
like that so okay so multics
was trying to just do some of the clean

444
00:09:19,150 --> 00:09:19,160
was trying to just do some of the clean
 

445
00:09:19,160 --> 00:09:21,040
was trying to just do some of the clean
it up a little bit well it was it was

446
00:09:21,040 --> 00:09:21,050
it up a little bit well it was it was
 

447
00:09:21,050 --> 00:09:22,240
it up a little bit well it was it was
meant to be much more than that so

448
00:09:22,240 --> 00:09:22,250
meant to be much more than that so
 

449
00:09:22,250 --> 00:09:24,280
meant to be much more than that so
multix was the multiplexed information

450
00:09:24,280 --> 00:09:24,290
multix was the multiplexed information
 

451
00:09:24,290 --> 00:09:26,050
multix was the multiplexed information
and computing service and it was meant

452
00:09:26,050 --> 00:09:26,060
and computing service and it was meant
 

453
00:09:26,060 --> 00:09:28,000
and computing service and it was meant
to be a very large thing we would

454
00:09:28,000 --> 00:09:28,010
to be a very large thing we would
 

455
00:09:28,010 --> 00:09:30,550
to be a very large thing we would
provide computing utility something that

456
00:09:30,550 --> 00:09:30,560
provide computing utility something that
 

457
00:09:30,560 --> 00:09:33,010
provide computing utility something that
where you could actually think of it as

458
00:09:33,010 --> 00:09:33,020
where you could actually think of it as
 

459
00:09:33,020 --> 00:09:35,440
where you could actually think of it as
just a plug in the wall service sort of

460
00:09:35,440 --> 00:09:35,450
just a plug in the wall service sort of
 

461
00:09:35,450 --> 00:09:37,329
just a plug in the wall service sort of
like cloud computing today yeah same

462
00:09:37,329 --> 00:09:37,339
like cloud computing today yeah same
 

463
00:09:37,339 --> 00:09:40,480
like cloud computing today yeah same
idea but 50 odd years earlier

464
00:09:40,480 --> 00:09:40,490
idea but 50 odd years earlier
 

465
00:09:40,490 --> 00:09:44,680
idea but 50 odd years earlier
and so what multix offered was a richer

466
00:09:44,680 --> 00:09:44,690
and so what multix offered was a richer
 

467
00:09:44,690 --> 00:09:47,290
and so what multix offered was a richer
operating system environment piece of

468
00:09:47,290 --> 00:09:47,300
operating system environment piece of
 

469
00:09:47,300 --> 00:09:49,240
operating system environment piece of
hardware that was better designed for

470
00:09:49,240 --> 00:09:49,250
hardware that was better designed for
 

471
00:09:49,250 --> 00:09:51,910
hardware that was better designed for
doing the kind of sharing of resources

472
00:09:51,910 --> 00:09:51,920
doing the kind of sharing of resources
 

473
00:09:51,920 --> 00:09:56,079
doing the kind of sharing of resources
and presumably lots of other things do

474
00:09:56,079 --> 00:09:56,089
and presumably lots of other things do
 

475
00:09:56,089 --> 00:09:57,370
and presumably lots of other things do
you think people at that time had the

476
00:09:57,370 --> 00:09:57,380
you think people at that time had the
 

477
00:09:57,380 --> 00:10:00,040
you think people at that time had the
dream of what cloud computing is

478
00:10:00,040 --> 00:10:00,050
dream of what cloud computing is
 

479
00:10:00,050 --> 00:10:01,530
dream of what cloud computing is
starting to become now which is

480
00:10:01,530 --> 00:10:01,540
starting to become now which is
 

481
00:10:01,540 --> 00:10:03,460
starting to become now which is
computing is everywhere that you can

482
00:10:03,460 --> 00:10:03,470
computing is everywhere that you can
 

483
00:10:03,470 --> 00:10:06,940
computing is everywhere that you can
just plug in almost no you know and you

484
00:10:06,940 --> 00:10:06,950
just plug in almost no you know and you
 

485
00:10:06,950 --> 00:10:09,160
just plug in almost no you know and you
never know how the magic works you just

486
00:10:09,160 --> 00:10:09,170
never know how the magic works you just
 

487
00:10:09,170 --> 00:10:11,050
never know how the magic works you just
kind of plug in add in your little

488
00:10:11,050 --> 00:10:11,060
kind of plug in add in your little
 

489
00:10:11,060 --> 00:10:12,880
kind of plug in add in your little
computation they need to perform and it

490
00:10:12,880 --> 00:10:12,890
computation they need to perform and it
 

491
00:10:12,890 --> 00:10:15,040
computation they need to perform and it
does it it was that the dream I don't

492
00:10:15,040 --> 00:10:15,050
does it it was that the dream I don't
 

493
00:10:15,050 --> 00:10:16,329
does it it was that the dream I don't
know where that was the dream I wasn't

494
00:10:16,329 --> 00:10:16,339
know where that was the dream I wasn't
 

495
00:10:16,339 --> 00:10:17,889
know where that was the dream I wasn't
part of it at that point remember I was

496
00:10:17,889 --> 00:10:17,899
part of it at that point remember I was
 

497
00:10:17,899 --> 00:10:20,880
part of it at that point remember I was
an intern first summer but my sense is

498
00:10:20,880 --> 00:10:20,890
an intern first summer but my sense is
 

499
00:10:20,890 --> 00:10:23,410
an intern first summer but my sense is
given that it was over 50 years ago yeah

500
00:10:23,410 --> 00:10:23,420
given that it was over 50 years ago yeah
 

501
00:10:23,420 --> 00:10:25,060
given that it was over 50 years ago yeah
they had that idea that it was an

502
00:10:25,060 --> 00:10:25,070
they had that idea that it was an
 

503
00:10:25,070 --> 00:10:26,800
they had that idea that it was an
information utility that it was

504
00:10:26,800 --> 00:10:26,810
information utility that it was
 

505
00:10:26,810 --> 00:10:28,480
information utility that it was
something where if you had a computing

506
00:10:28,480 --> 00:10:28,490
something where if you had a computing
 

507
00:10:28,490 --> 00:10:31,300
something where if you had a computing
task to do you could just go and do it

508
00:10:31,300 --> 00:10:31,310
task to do you could just go and do it
 

509
00:10:31,310 --> 00:10:34,120
task to do you could just go and do it
now I'm betting that they didn't have

510
00:10:34,120 --> 00:10:34,130
now I'm betting that they didn't have
 

511
00:10:34,130 --> 00:10:37,510
now I'm betting that they didn't have
the same view of computing for the

512
00:10:37,510 --> 00:10:37,520
the same view of computing for the
 

513
00:10:37,520 --> 00:10:39,819
the same view of computing for the
masses let's call it the idea that you

514
00:10:39,819 --> 00:10:39,829
masses let's call it the idea that you
 

515
00:10:39,829 --> 00:10:42,340
masses let's call it the idea that you
know your grandmother would be shopping

516
00:10:42,340 --> 00:10:42,350
know your grandmother would be shopping
 

517
00:10:42,350 --> 00:10:44,319
know your grandmother would be shopping
on Amazon I don't think that was part of

518
00:10:44,319 --> 00:10:44,329
on Amazon I don't think that was part of
 

519
00:10:44,329 --> 00:10:46,510
on Amazon I don't think that was part of
it but if your grandmother were a

520
00:10:46,510 --> 00:10:46,520
it but if your grandmother were a
 

521
00:10:46,520 --> 00:10:48,610
it but if your grandmother were a
programmer it might be very easy for her

522
00:10:48,610 --> 00:10:48,620
programmer it might be very easy for her
 

523
00:10:48,620 --> 00:10:51,670
programmer it might be very easy for her
to go and use this kind of utility what

524
00:10:51,670 --> 00:10:51,680
to go and use this kind of utility what
 

525
00:10:51,680 --> 00:10:53,560
to go and use this kind of utility what
was your dream of computers at that time

526
00:10:53,560 --> 00:10:53,570
was your dream of computers at that time
 

527
00:10:53,570 --> 00:10:54,880
was your dream of computers at that time
what did you see as the future of

528
00:10:54,880 --> 00:10:54,890
what did you see as the future of
 

529
00:10:54,890 --> 00:10:57,069
what did you see as the future of
computers could you have predicted what

530
00:10:57,069 --> 00:10:57,079
computers could you have predicted what
 

531
00:10:57,079 --> 00:10:59,620
computers could you have predicted what
computers are today that you sense Oh

532
00:10:59,620 --> 00:10:59,630
computers are today that you sense Oh
 

533
00:10:59,630 --> 00:11:02,050
computers are today that you sense Oh
short answer absolutely not I have no

534
00:11:02,050 --> 00:11:02,060
short answer absolutely not I have no
 

535
00:11:02,060 --> 00:11:04,180
short answer absolutely not I have no
clue I'm not sure I had a dream it was a

536
00:11:04,180 --> 00:11:04,190
clue I'm not sure I had a dream it was a
 

537
00:11:04,190 --> 00:11:05,470
clue I'm not sure I had a dream it was a
dream job in the sense

538
00:11:05,470 --> 00:11:05,480
dream job in the sense
 

539
00:11:05,480 --> 00:11:07,600
dream job in the sense
that I really enjoyed what I was doing I

540
00:11:07,600 --> 00:11:07,610
that I really enjoyed what I was doing I
 

541
00:11:07,610 --> 00:11:09,009
that I really enjoyed what I was doing I
was surrounded by really really nice

542
00:11:09,009 --> 00:11:09,019
was surrounded by really really nice
 

543
00:11:09,019 --> 00:11:11,680
was surrounded by really really nice
people Cambridge is a very fine city to

544
00:11:11,680 --> 00:11:11,690
people Cambridge is a very fine city to
 

545
00:11:11,690 --> 00:11:13,420
people Cambridge is a very fine city to
live in in the summer less so in the

546
00:11:13,420 --> 00:11:13,430
live in in the summer less so in the
 

547
00:11:13,430 --> 00:11:14,829
live in in the summer less so in the
winter when it snows but in the summer

548
00:11:14,829 --> 00:11:14,839
winter when it snows but in the summer
 

549
00:11:14,839 --> 00:11:17,829
winter when it snows but in the summer
it was a delightful time and so I really

550
00:11:17,829 --> 00:11:17,839
it was a delightful time and so I really
 

551
00:11:17,839 --> 00:11:19,810
it was a delightful time and so I really
enjoyed all of that stuff and I learned

552
00:11:19,810 --> 00:11:19,820
enjoyed all of that stuff and I learned
 

553
00:11:19,820 --> 00:11:23,199
enjoyed all of that stuff and I learned
things and I think the good fortune of

554
00:11:23,199 --> 00:11:23,209
things and I think the good fortune of
 

555
00:11:23,209 --> 00:11:25,900
things and I think the good fortune of
being there for summer led me then to

556
00:11:25,900 --> 00:11:25,910
being there for summer led me then to
 

557
00:11:25,910 --> 00:11:27,280
being there for summer led me then to
get a summer job at Bell Labs the

558
00:11:27,280 --> 00:11:27,290
get a summer job at Bell Labs the
 

559
00:11:27,290 --> 00:11:29,500
get a summer job at Bell Labs the
following summer and that was going to

560
00:11:29,500 --> 00:11:29,510
following summer and that was going to
 

561
00:11:29,510 --> 00:11:32,800
following summer and that was going to
useful for the future so this Bell Labs

562
00:11:32,800 --> 00:11:32,810
useful for the future so this Bell Labs
 

563
00:11:32,810 --> 00:11:36,699
useful for the future so this Bell Labs
is this magical legendary place so first

564
00:11:36,699 --> 00:11:36,709
is this magical legendary place so first
 

565
00:11:36,709 --> 00:11:41,079
is this magical legendary place so first
of all where is Bell Labs and can you

566
00:11:41,079 --> 00:11:41,089
of all where is Bell Labs and can you
 

567
00:11:41,089 --> 00:11:44,530
of all where is Bell Labs and can you
start talking about that journey towards

568
00:11:44,530 --> 00:11:44,540
start talking about that journey towards
 

569
00:11:44,540 --> 00:11:46,210
start talking about that journey towards
Unix at Bell Labs

570
00:11:46,210 --> 00:11:46,220
Unix at Bell Labs
 

571
00:11:46,220 --> 00:11:48,180
Unix at Bell Labs
yeah so Bell Labs is physically

572
00:11:48,180 --> 00:11:48,190
yeah so Bell Labs is physically
 

573
00:11:48,190 --> 00:11:51,519
yeah so Bell Labs is physically
scattered around at the time scattered

574
00:11:51,519 --> 00:11:51,529
scattered around at the time scattered
 

575
00:11:51,529 --> 00:11:53,019
scattered around at the time scattered
around New Jersey the primary location

576
00:11:53,019 --> 00:11:53,029
around New Jersey the primary location
 

577
00:11:53,029 --> 00:11:55,060
around New Jersey the primary location
was in a town called Murray Hill where a

00:11:55,060 --> 00:11:55,070
was in a town called Murray Hill where a
 

579
00:11:55,070 --> 00:11:56,829
was in a town called Murray Hill where a

00:11:59,170 --> 00:11:59,180
then across the boundary between two
 

583
00:11:59,180 --> 00:12:01,240
then across the boundary between two
small towns in New Jersey called New

Providence and Berkeley Heights think of

586
00:12:03,670 --> 00:12:03,680
Providence and Berkeley Heights think of
 

587
00:12:03,680 --> 00:12:05,500
Providence and Berkeley Heights think of
it as about 15-20 miles straight west of

it as about 15-20 miles straight west of
New York City and therefore but an hour

613
00:12:38,899 --> 00:12:42,400

00:12:42,400 --> 00:12:42,410
models of what was going on so that was
 

615
00:12:42,410 --> 00:12:44,530
models of what was going on so that was
the essence of Bell Labs and again I

that was another internship I got lucky

620
00:12:48,400 --> 00:12:48,410
that was another internship I got lucky
 

621
00:12:48,410 --> 00:12:51,009
that was another internship I got lucky
in internships I mean if you could just

00:12:51,009 --> 00:12:51,019
in internships I mean if you could just

00:12:51,019 --> 00:12:54,579

legendary computer scientists that come
 

633
00:13:01,399 --> 00:13:03,689
legendary computer scientists that come
from their inventions including

634
00:13:03,689 --> 00:13:03,699
from their inventions including
 

635
00:13:03,699 --> 00:13:07,059
from their inventions including
developments including UNIX it's just is

636
00:13:07,059 --> 00:13:07,069
developments including UNIX it's just is
 

637
00:13:07,069 --> 00:13:09,400
developments including UNIX it's just is
unbelievable so is it was there

638
00:13:09,400 --> 00:13:09,410
unbelievable so is it was there
 

639
00:13:09,410 --> 00:13:11,650
unbelievable so is it was there
something special about that place oh I

640
00:13:11,650 --> 00:13:11,660
something special about that place oh I
 

641
00:13:11,660 --> 00:13:12,939
something special about that place oh I
think there was very definitely

642
00:13:12,939 --> 00:13:12,949
think there was very definitely
 

643
00:13:12,949 --> 00:13:15,370
think there was very definitely
something special I mentioned the number

644
00:13:15,370 --> 00:13:15,380
something special I mentioned the number
 

645
00:13:15,380 --> 00:13:16,600
something special I mentioned the number
of people's a very large number of

646
00:13:16,600 --> 00:13:16,610
of people's a very large number of
 

647
00:13:16,610 --> 00:13:19,280
of people's a very large number of
people very highly skilled

648
00:13:19,280 --> 00:13:19,290
people very highly skilled
 

649
00:13:19,290 --> 00:13:20,900
people very highly skilled
working in an environment where there

650
00:13:20,900 --> 00:13:20,910
working in an environment where there
 

651
00:13:20,910 --> 00:13:22,519
working in an environment where there
was always something interesting to work

652
00:13:22,519 --> 00:13:22,529
was always something interesting to work
 

653
00:13:22,529 --> 00:13:25,189
was always something interesting to work
on because the goal of Bell Labs which

654
00:13:25,189 --> 00:13:25,199
on because the goal of Bell Labs which
 

655
00:13:25,199 --> 00:13:27,800
on because the goal of Bell Labs which
was a small part of a TMT which provided

656
00:13:27,800 --> 00:13:27,810
was a small part of a TMT which provided
 

657
00:13:27,810 --> 00:13:29,449
was a small part of a TMT which provided
basically the country's phone service

658
00:13:29,449 --> 00:13:29,459
basically the country's phone service
 

659
00:13:29,459 --> 00:13:32,360
basically the country's phone service
the goal of a TMT was to provide service

660
00:13:32,360 --> 00:13:32,370
the goal of a TMT was to provide service
 

661
00:13:32,370 --> 00:13:34,999
the goal of a TMT was to provide service
for everybody and the goal of Bell Labs

662
00:13:34,999 --> 00:13:35,009
for everybody and the goal of Bell Labs
 

663
00:13:35,009 --> 00:13:37,069
for everybody and the goal of Bell Labs
was to try and make that service keep

664
00:13:37,069 --> 00:13:37,079
was to try and make that service keep
 

665
00:13:37,079 --> 00:13:39,110
was to try and make that service keep
getting better so improving service and

666
00:13:39,110 --> 00:13:39,120
getting better so improving service and
 

667
00:13:39,120 --> 00:13:42,350
getting better so improving service and
that meant doing research on a lot of

668
00:13:42,350 --> 00:13:42,360
that meant doing research on a lot of
 

669
00:13:42,360 --> 00:13:45,199
that meant doing research on a lot of
different things physical devices like

670
00:13:45,199 --> 00:13:45,209
different things physical devices like
 

671
00:13:45,209 --> 00:13:48,559
different things physical devices like
the transistor or fiber optical cables

672
00:13:48,559 --> 00:13:48,569
the transistor or fiber optical cables
 

673
00:13:48,569 --> 00:13:51,590
the transistor or fiber optical cables
or microwave systems all of these things

674
00:13:51,590 --> 00:13:51,600
or microwave systems all of these things
 

675
00:13:51,600 --> 00:13:54,319
or microwave systems all of these things
the labs worked on and it was kind of

676
00:13:54,319 --> 00:13:54,329
the labs worked on and it was kind of
 

677
00:13:54,329 --> 00:13:56,629
the labs worked on and it was kind of
just the beginning of real boom times in

678
00:13:56,629 --> 00:13:56,639
just the beginning of real boom times in
 

679
00:13:56,639 --> 00:13:59,059
just the beginning of real boom times in
computing as well is when I was there I

680
00:13:59,059 --> 00:13:59,069
computing as well is when I was there I
 

681
00:13:59,069 --> 00:14:02,120
computing as well is when I was there I
went there first in 66 so computing was

682
00:14:02,120 --> 00:14:02,130
went there first in 66 so computing was
 

683
00:14:02,130 --> 00:14:05,300
went there first in 66 so computing was
at that point fairly young and so people

684
00:14:05,300 --> 00:14:05,310
at that point fairly young and so people
 

685
00:14:05,310 --> 00:14:06,650
at that point fairly young and so people
were discovering that you could do lots

686
00:14:06,650 --> 00:14:06,660
were discovering that you could do lots
 

687
00:14:06,660 --> 00:14:07,840
were discovering that you could do lots
of things with computers

688
00:14:07,840 --> 00:14:07,850
of things with computers
 

689
00:14:07,850 --> 00:14:13,370
of things with computers
so how's Unix born so multix in spite of

690
00:14:13,370 --> 00:14:13,380
so how's Unix born so multix in spite of
 

691
00:14:13,380 --> 00:14:15,050
so how's Unix born so multix in spite of
having an enormous number of really good

692
00:14:15,050 --> 00:14:15,060
having an enormous number of really good
 

693
00:14:15,060 --> 00:14:16,819
having an enormous number of really good
ideas lots of good people working on it

694
00:14:16,819 --> 00:14:16,829
ideas lots of good people working on it
 

695
00:14:16,829 --> 00:14:19,550
ideas lots of good people working on it
fundamentally didn't live up at least in

696
00:14:19,550 --> 00:14:19,560
fundamentally didn't live up at least in
 

697
00:14:19,560 --> 00:14:21,170
fundamentally didn't live up at least in
the short run and I think ultimately

698
00:14:21,170 --> 00:14:21,180
the short run and I think ultimately
 

699
00:14:21,180 --> 00:14:24,050
the short run and I think ultimately
really ever to its goal of being this

700
00:14:24,050 --> 00:14:24,060
really ever to its goal of being this
 

701
00:14:24,060 --> 00:14:27,079
really ever to its goal of being this
information utility it was too expensive

702
00:14:27,079 --> 00:14:27,089
information utility it was too expensive
 

703
00:14:27,089 --> 00:14:29,300
information utility it was too expensive
and certainly what was promised was

704
00:14:29,300 --> 00:14:29,310
and certainly what was promised was
 

705
00:14:29,310 --> 00:14:32,210
and certainly what was promised was
delivered much too late and so in

706
00:14:32,210 --> 00:14:32,220
delivered much too late and so in
 

707
00:14:32,220 --> 00:14:35,000
delivered much too late and so in
roughly the beginning of 1969 Bell Labs

708
00:14:35,000 --> 00:14:35,010
roughly the beginning of 1969 Bell Labs
 

709
00:14:35,010 --> 00:14:38,240
roughly the beginning of 1969 Bell Labs
pulled out of the project the project at

710
00:14:38,240 --> 00:14:38,250
pulled out of the project the project at
 

711
00:14:38,250 --> 00:14:42,050
pulled out of the project the project at
that point had included MIT Bell Labs

712
00:14:42,050 --> 00:14:42,060
that point had included MIT Bell Labs
 

713
00:14:42,060 --> 00:14:44,660
that point had included MIT Bell Labs
and General Electric General Electric

714
00:14:44,660 --> 00:14:44,670
and General Electric General Electric
 

715
00:14:44,670 --> 00:14:46,250
and General Electric General Electric
made computers so General Electric was

716
00:14:46,250 --> 00:14:46,260
made computers so General Electric was
 

717
00:14:46,260 --> 00:14:48,829
made computers so General Electric was
the hardware operation so Bell Labs

718
00:14:48,829 --> 00:14:48,839
the hardware operation so Bell Labs
 

719
00:14:48,839 --> 00:14:50,960
the hardware operation so Bell Labs
realizing this wasn't going anywhere on

720
00:14:50,960 --> 00:14:50,970
realizing this wasn't going anywhere on
 

721
00:14:50,970 --> 00:14:52,610
realizing this wasn't going anywhere on
a time scale they cared about

722
00:14:52,610 --> 00:14:52,620
a time scale they cared about
 

723
00:14:52,620 --> 00:14:54,800
a time scale they cared about
pulled out his project and this left

724
00:14:54,800 --> 00:14:54,810
pulled out his project and this left
 

725
00:14:54,810 --> 00:14:58,730
pulled out his project and this left
several people with an acquired taste

726
00:14:58,730 --> 00:14:58,740
several people with an acquired taste
 

727
00:14:58,740 --> 00:15:00,620
several people with an acquired taste
for really really nice computing

728
00:15:00,620 --> 00:15:00,630
for really really nice computing
 

729
00:15:00,630 --> 00:15:02,329
for really really nice computing
environments but no computing

730
00:15:02,329 --> 00:15:02,339
environments but no computing
 

731
00:15:02,339 --> 00:15:04,759
environments but no computing
environment and so they started thinking

732
00:15:04,759 --> 00:15:04,769
environment and so they started thinking
 

733
00:15:04,769 --> 00:15:07,129
environment and so they started thinking
about what could you do if you're going

734
00:15:07,129 --> 00:15:07,139
about what could you do if you're going
 

735
00:15:07,139 --> 00:15:09,559
about what could you do if you're going
to design a new operating system that

736
00:15:09,559 --> 00:15:09,569
to design a new operating system that
 

737
00:15:09,569 --> 00:15:11,150
to design a new operating system that
would provide the same kind of

738
00:15:11,150 --> 00:15:11,160
would provide the same kind of
 

739
00:15:11,160 --> 00:15:14,329
would provide the same kind of
comfortable computing as cts s head but

740
00:15:14,329 --> 00:15:14,339
comfortable computing as cts s head but
 

741
00:15:14,339 --> 00:15:16,129
comfortable computing as cts s head but
also the facilities of something like

742
00:15:16,129 --> 00:15:16,139
also the facilities of something like
 

743
00:15:16,139 --> 00:15:19,639
also the facilities of something like
multics sort of brought forward and so

744
00:15:19,639 --> 00:15:19,649
multics sort of brought forward and so
 

745
00:15:19,649 --> 00:15:21,439
multics sort of brought forward and so
they did a lot of paper design stuff and

746
00:15:21,439 --> 00:15:21,449
they did a lot of paper design stuff and
 

747
00:15:21,449 --> 00:15:24,019
they did a lot of paper design stuff and
at the same time Ken Thompson found what

748
00:15:24,019 --> 00:15:24,029
at the same time Ken Thompson found what
 

749
00:15:24,029 --> 00:15:26,559
at the same time Ken Thompson found what
is characterized as a little-used pdp-7

750
00:15:26,559 --> 00:15:26,569
is characterized as a little-used pdp-7

00:15:29,990 --> 00:15:30,000
where he started to do experiments with
 

753
00:15:30,000 --> 00:15:31,759
where he started to do experiments with
file systems just how do you

754
00:15:31,759 --> 00:15:31,769
file systems just how do you
 

755
00:15:31,769 --> 00:15:33,799
file systems just how do you
store information on a computer in an

00:15:33,799 --> 00:15:33,809
store information on a computer in an
 

757
00:15:33,809 --> 00:15:36,259
store information on a computer in an
efficient way and then this famous story

758
00:15:36,259 --> 00:15:36,269
efficient way and then this famous story
 

759
00:15:36,269 --> 00:15:37,999
efficient way and then this famous story
that his wife went away to California

760
00:15:37,999 --> 00:15:38,009
that his wife went away to California
 

761

for three weeks taking their
 

763
00:15:39,689 --> 00:15:42,979
for three weeks taking their
one-year-old son and three weeks and he

764
00:15:42,979 --> 00:15:42,989
one-year-old son and three weeks and he
 

765
00:15:42,989 --> 00:15:44,989
one-year-old son and three weeks and he
sat down and wrote an operating system

766
00:15:44,989 --> 00:15:44,999
sat down and wrote an operating system
 

767
00:15:44,999 --> 00:15:48,199
sat down and wrote an operating system
which ultimately became Unix so software

768
00:15:48,199 --> 00:15:48,209
which ultimately became Unix so software

which ultimately became Unix so software
productivity was good in those days

770
00:15:49,850 --> 00:15:49,860
productivity was good in those days
 

771
00:15:49,860 --> 00:15:52,340
productivity was good in those days
the PDP what's the PDP seven so it's a

772
00:15:52,340 --> 00:15:52,350
the PDP what's the PDP seven so it's a
 

773
00:15:52,350 --> 00:15:53,960
the PDP what's the PDP seven so it's a
piece of hardware yeah it's a piece of

00:15:53,960 --> 00:15:53,970
piece of hardware yeah it's a piece of
 

775
00:15:53,970 --> 00:15:56,150
piece of hardware yeah it's a piece of
part where it was one of our leading

00:16:01,970 --> 00:16:01,980
Corporation Dec and it was a mini
 

781
00:16:01,980 --> 00:16:03,410
Corporation Dec and it was a mini
computer so called

782
00:16:03,410 --> 00:16:03,420
computer so called
 

783
00:16:03,420 --> 00:16:06,739
computer so called
it had yeah I would have to look up the

784
00:16:06,739 --> 00:16:06,749
it had yeah I would have to look up the
 

785
00:16:06,749 --> 00:16:08,449
it had yeah I would have to look up the
numbers exactly but it had a very small

786
00:16:08,449 --> 00:16:08,459
numbers exactly but it had a very small
 

787
00:16:08,459 --> 00:16:12,259
numbers exactly but it had a very small
amount of memory maybe 16 K 16-bit words

788
00:16:12,259 --> 00:16:12,269
amount of memory maybe 16 K 16-bit words
 

789
00:16:12,269 --> 00:16:14,769
amount of memory maybe 16 K 16-bit words
or something like that relatively slow

790
00:16:14,769 --> 00:16:14,779
or something like that relatively slow
 

791
00:16:14,779 --> 00:16:18,049
or something like that relatively slow

that there's a system I was created in

you could think of most of the computers

sudden these computers took over the

00:20:20,120 --> 00:20:20,130
sudden these computers took over the
 

995
00:20:20,130 --> 00:20:22,159
sudden these computers took over the
world and they started from this little

996
00:20:22,159 --> 00:20:22,169
world and they started from this little
 

997

how does that make you feel it's quite

1000
00:20:26,960 --> 00:20:26,970
how does that make you feel it's quite
 

1001
00:20:26,970 --> 00:20:29,360
how does that make you feel it's quite
surprising and and and you asked earlier

1002
00:20:29,360 --> 00:20:29,370
surprising and and and you asked earlier
 

1003
00:20:29,370 --> 00:20:31,190
surprising and and and you asked earlier
but predictions the answer is no there's

1004
00:20:31,190 --> 00:20:31,200
but predictions the answer is no there's
 

1005
00:20:31,200 --> 00:20:33,320
but predictions the answer is no there's
no way you could predict that kind of

1006
00:20:33,320 --> 00:20:33,330
no way you could predict that kind of
 

1007
00:20:33,330 --> 00:20:36,409
no way you could predict that kind of
evolution and I don't know whether it

1008
00:20:36,409 --> 00:20:36,419
evolution and I don't know whether it
 

1009
00:20:36,419 --> 00:20:38,240
evolution and I don't know whether it
was inevitable or just a whole sequence

1010
00:20:38,240 --> 00:20:38,250
was inevitable or just a whole sequence
 

1011
00:20:38,250 --> 00:20:40,340
was inevitable or just a whole sequence
of blind luck I suspect more the latter

1012
00:20:40,340 --> 00:20:40,350
of blind luck I suspect more the latter
 

1013
00:20:40,350 --> 00:20:44,000
of blind luck I suspect more the latter
and so I look at it and think gee that's

1014
00:20:44,000 --> 00:20:44,010
and so I look at it and think gee that's
 

1015
00:20:44,010 --> 00:20:48,649
and so I look at it and think gee that's
kind of neat I think the real question

1016
00:20:48,649 --> 00:20:48,659
kind of neat I think the real question
 

1017
00:20:48,659 --> 00:20:50,200
kind of neat I think the real question
is what this can think about that

1018
00:20:50,200 --> 00:20:50,210
is what this can think about that
 

1019
00:20:50,210 --> 00:20:53,690
is what this can think about that
because he's the guy arguably from whom

it really came tremendous contributions

1022
00:20:56,210 --> 00:20:56,220
it really came tremendous contributions
 

1023
00:20:56,220 --> 00:20:57,799
it really came tremendous contributions
from Dennis Ritchie and then others

1024
00:20:57,799 --> 00:20:57,809
from Dennis Ritchie and then others
 

1025

around in that Bell Labs environment but

00:21:00,350 --> 00:21:00,360
around in that Bell Labs environment but
 

1027
00:21:00,360 --> 00:21:01,610
around in that Bell Labs environment but
you know if you had to pick a single

1028
00:21:01,610 --> 00:21:01,620
you know if you had to pick a single
 

1029
00:21:01,620 --> 00:21:05,480
you know if you had to pick a single
person that would be can see if written

1030
00:21:05,480 --> 00:21:05,490
person that would be can see if written

UNIX a history and a memoir are there

1034
00:21:08,629 --> 00:21:08,639
UNIX a history and a memoir are there
 

1035
00:21:08,639 --> 00:21:11,509
UNIX a history and a memoir are there
some memorable human stories funny or

1036
00:21:11,509 --> 00:21:11,519
some memorable human stories funny or
 

1037
00:21:11,519 --> 00:21:13,190
some memorable human stories funny or
profound from that time they just kind

1038
00:21:13,190 --> 00:21:13,200
profound from that time they just kind
 

1039
00:21:13,200 --> 00:21:15,259
profound from that time they just kind
of stand out oh there's a lot of them in

1040
00:21:15,259 --> 00:21:15,269
of stand out oh there's a lot of them in
 

1041
00:21:15,269 --> 00:21:16,970
of stand out oh there's a lot of them in
a sense and again it's a question if can

1042
00:21:16,970 --> 00:21:16,980
a sense and again it's a question if can
 

1043

a sense and again it's a question if can
you resurrect them this memory fails but

1044
00:21:21,950 --> 00:21:21,960
you resurrect them this memory fails but
 

1045
00:21:21,960 --> 00:21:24,500
you resurrect them this memory fails but
I think part of it was that Bell Labs at

1046
00:21:24,500 --> 00:21:24,510
I think part of it was that Bell Labs at
 

1047
00:21:24,510 --> 00:21:26,419
I think part of it was that Bell Labs at
the time was was a very special kind of

1048
00:21:26,419 --> 00:21:26,429
the time was was a very special kind of
 

1049
00:21:26,429 --> 00:21:27,769
the time was was a very special kind of
place to work because there were a lot

1050
00:21:27,769 --> 00:21:27,779
place to work because there were a lot
 

1051
00:21:27,779 --> 00:21:29,360
place to work because there were a lot
of interesting people and the

1052
00:21:29,360 --> 00:21:29,370
of interesting people and the
 

1053
00:21:29,370 --> 00:21:31,669
of interesting people and the
environment was very very open and free

1054
00:21:31,669 --> 00:21:31,679
environment was very very open and free
 

1055
00:21:31,679 --> 00:21:33,320
environment was very very open and free
it was a very cooperative environment

1056
00:21:33,320 --> 00:21:33,330
it was a very cooperative environment
 

1057
00:21:33,330 --> 00:21:34,909
it was a very cooperative environment
very from the environment and so if you

1058
00:21:34,909 --> 00:21:34,919
very from the environment and so if you
 

1059
00:21:34,919 --> 00:21:36,350
very from the environment and so if you
had an interesting problem you go and

1060
00:21:36,350 --> 00:21:36,360
had an interesting problem you go and
 

1061
00:21:36,360 --> 00:21:37,970
had an interesting problem you go and
talk to somebody and they might help you

1062
00:21:37,970 --> 00:21:37,980
talk to somebody and they might help you
 

1063
00:21:37,980 --> 00:21:42,379
talk to somebody and they might help you
with the solution and and it was a kind

1064
00:21:42,379 --> 00:21:42,389
with the solution and and it was a kind
 

1065
00:21:42,389 --> 00:21:44,389
with the solution and and it was a kind
of a fun environment to in which people

1066
00:21:44,389 --> 00:21:44,399
of a fun environment to in which people
 

1067
00:21:44,399 --> 00:21:49,100
of a fun environment to in which people
did strange things and often tweaking

1068
00:21:49,100 --> 00:21:49,110
did strange things and often tweaking
 

1069
00:21:49,110 --> 00:21:51,529
did strange things and often tweaking
the bureaucracy in one way or another

1070
00:21:51,529 --> 00:21:51,539
the bureaucracy in one way or another
 

1071
00:21:51,539 --> 00:21:54,860
the bureaucracy in one way or another
the rebellious and in some kinds of ways

1072
00:21:54,860 --> 00:21:54,870
the rebellious and in some kinds of ways
 

1073
00:21:54,870 --> 00:21:56,840
the rebellious and in some kinds of ways
in some ways yeah absolutely I think

1074
00:21:56,840 --> 00:21:56,850
in some ways yeah absolutely I think
 

1075
00:21:56,850 --> 00:21:58,820
in some ways yeah absolutely I think
most people didn't take too kindly to

1076
00:21:58,820 --> 00:21:58,830
most people didn't take too kindly to
 

1077
00:21:58,830 --> 00:22:00,230
most people didn't take too kindly to
the bureaucracy and I'm sure the

1078
00:22:00,230 --> 00:22:00,240
the bureaucracy and I'm sure the
 

1079
00:22:00,240 --> 00:22:03,950
the bureaucracy and I'm sure the
bureaucracy put up with an enormous that

1080
00:22:03,950 --> 00:22:03,960
bureaucracy put up with an enormous that
 

1081
00:22:03,960 --> 00:22:07,820
bureaucracy put up with an enormous that
they didn't really want to so maybe to

00:22:07,820 --> 00:22:07,830
they didn't really want to so maybe to
 

1083
00:22:07,830 --> 00:22:09,740
they didn't really want to so maybe to
linger on it a little bit you have a

1084
00:22:09,740 --> 00:22:09,750
linger on it a little bit you have a
 

1085
00:22:09,750 --> 00:22:11,560
linger on it a little bit you have a
sense of what the philosophy that

1086
00:22:11,560 --> 00:22:11,570
sense of what the philosophy that
 

1087
00:22:11,570 --> 00:22:12,680

being there being around what's the
 

1095
00:22:21,060 --> 00:22:22,910
being there being around what's the
fundamental philosophy behind the system

1096
00:22:22,910 --> 00:22:22,920
fundamental philosophy behind the system
 

1097
00:22:22,920 --> 00:22:25,070
fundamental philosophy behind the system
I think one aspect the fundamental

1098
00:22:25,070 --> 00:22:25,080
I think one aspect the fundamental
 

1099
00:22:25,080 --> 00:22:27,470
I think one aspect the fundamental
philosophy was to provide an environment

1100
00:22:27,470 --> 00:22:27,480
philosophy was to provide an environment

a programmer environment it wasn't meant

1106
00:22:34,280 --> 00:22:34,290
a programmer environment it wasn't meant
 

1107
00:22:34,290 --> 00:22:36,560
a programmer environment it wasn't meant
specifically as something to do some

1108
00:22:36,560 --> 00:22:36,570
specifically as something to do some
 

1109
00:22:36,570 --> 00:22:39,050
specifically as something to do some
other kind of job for example it was

1110
00:22:39,050 --> 00:22:39,060
other kind of job for example it was
 

1111
00:22:39,060 --> 00:22:41,480
other kind of job for example it was
used extensively for word processing but

1112
00:22:41,480 --> 00:22:41,490
used extensively for word processing but
 

1113
00:22:41,490 --> 00:22:43,070
used extensively for word processing but
it wasn't designed as a word processing

1114
00:22:43,070 --> 00:22:43,080
it wasn't designed as a word processing
 

1115
00:22:43,080 --> 00:22:45,290
it wasn't designed as a word processing
system it was used extensively for lab

1116
00:22:45,290 --> 00:22:45,300
system it was used extensively for lab
 

1117
00:22:45,300 --> 00:22:47,090
system it was used extensively for lab
control but it wasn't designed for that

1118
00:22:47,090 --> 00:22:47,100
control but it wasn't designed for that
 

1119
00:22:47,100 --> 00:22:49,070
control but it wasn't designed for that
it was used extensively as a front end

1120
00:22:49,070 --> 00:22:49,080
it was used extensively as a front end
 

1121
00:22:49,080 --> 00:22:52,190
it was used extensively as a front end
for big other systems big dumb systems

1122
00:22:52,190 --> 00:22:52,200
for big other systems big dumb systems
 

1123
00:22:52,200 --> 00:22:54,020
for big other systems big dumb systems
but it wasn't designed for that it was

1124
00:22:54,020 --> 00:22:54,030
but it wasn't designed for that it was
 

1125
00:22:54,030 --> 00:22:56,090
but it wasn't designed for that it was
meant to be an environment where it was

1126
00:22:56,090 --> 00:22:56,100
meant to be an environment where it was
 

1127
00:22:56,100 --> 00:22:58,220
meant to be an environment where it was
really easy to write programs that so

1128
00:22:58,220 --> 00:22:58,230
really easy to write programs that so
 

1129
00:22:58,230 --> 00:22:59,420
really easy to write programs that so
the programmers could be highly

1130
00:22:59,420 --> 00:22:59,430
the programmers could be highly
 

1131
00:22:59,430 --> 00:23:02,180
the programmers could be highly
productive and part of that was to be a

1132
00:23:02,180 --> 00:23:02,190
productive and part of that was to be a
 

1133
00:23:02,190 --> 00:23:04,430
productive and part of that was to be a
community and there's some observation

1134
00:23:04,430 --> 00:23:04,440
community and there's some observation
 

1135
00:23:04,440 --> 00:23:06,260
community and there's some observation
from Dennis Ritchie I think at the end

1136
00:23:06,260 --> 00:23:06,270
from Dennis Ritchie I think at the end
 

1137
00:23:06,270 --> 00:23:08,390
from Dennis Ritchie I think at the end
of the book that says that and that from

1138
00:23:08,390 --> 00:23:08,400
of the book that says that and that from
 

1139
00:23:08,400 --> 00:23:10,700
of the book that says that and that from
his standpoint the real goal was to

1140
00:23:10,700 --> 00:23:10,710
his standpoint the real goal was to
 

1141
00:23:10,710 --> 00:23:12,560
his standpoint the real goal was to
create a community where people could

1142
00:23:12,560 --> 00:23:12,570
create a community where people could
 

1143
00:23:12,570 --> 00:23:17,420
create a community where people could
work as programmers on a system I think

1144
00:23:17,420 --> 00:23:17,430
work as programmers on a system I think
 

1145
00:23:17,430 --> 00:23:19,100
work as programmers on a system I think
in that sense certainly for many many

1146
00:23:19,100 --> 00:23:19,110
in that sense certainly for many many
 

1147
00:23:19,110 --> 00:23:22,070
in that sense certainly for many many
years it succeeded quite well at that

1148
00:23:22,070 --> 00:23:22,080
years it succeeded quite well at that
 

1149
00:23:22,080 --> 00:23:24,440
years it succeeded quite well at that
and part of that is the technical

1150
00:23:24,440 --> 00:23:24,450
and part of that is the technical
 

1151
00:23:24,450 --> 00:23:26,390
and part of that is the technical
aspects of because it made it really

1152
00:23:26,390 --> 00:23:26,400
aspects of because it made it really
 

1153
00:23:26,400 --> 00:23:28,370
aspects of because it made it really
easy to write programs people did write

1154
00:23:28,370 --> 00:23:28,380
easy to write programs people did write
 

1155
00:23:28,380 --> 00:23:29,630
easy to write programs people did write
interesting programs those programs

1156
00:23:29,630 --> 00:23:29,640
interesting programs those programs
 

1157
00:23:29,640 --> 00:23:31,730
interesting programs those programs
tended to be used by other programmers

1158
00:23:31,730 --> 00:23:31,740
tended to be used by other programmers
 

1159
00:23:31,740 --> 00:23:33,560
tended to be used by other programmers
and so it was kind of a virtuous circle

1160
00:23:33,560 --> 00:23:33,570
and so it was kind of a virtuous circle
 

1161
00:23:33,570 --> 00:23:36,380
and so it was kind of a virtuous circle
are of more and more stuff coming out

1162
00:23:36,380 --> 00:23:36,390
are of more and more stuff coming out
 

1163
00:23:36,390 --> 00:23:39,170
are of more and more stuff coming out
that was really good for programmers and

1164
00:23:39,170 --> 00:23:39,180
that was really good for programmers and
 

1165
00:23:39,180 --> 00:23:40,520
that was really good for programmers and
you're part of that community of

1166
00:23:40,520 --> 00:23:40,530
you're part of that community of
 

1167
00:23:40,530 --> 00:23:42,830
you're part of that community of
programmers so what was the like writing

1168
00:23:42,830 --> 00:23:42,840
programmers so what was the like writing
 

1169
00:23:42,840 --> 00:23:46,010
programmers so what was the like writing
programs on that early unix it was a

1170
00:23:46,010 --> 00:23:46,020
programs on that early unix it was a
 

1171
00:23:46,020 --> 00:23:50,450
programs on that early unix it was a
blast it really was you know I like to

1172
00:23:50,450 --> 00:23:50,460
blast it really was you know I like to
 

1173
00:23:50,460 --> 00:23:52,160
blast it really was you know I like to
program I'm not a terribly good

1174
00:23:52,160 --> 00:23:52,170
program I'm not a terribly good
 

1175
00:23:52,170 --> 00:23:54,530
program I'm not a terribly good
programmer but it was a lot of fun to

1176
00:23:54,530 --> 00:23:54,540
programmer but it was a lot of fun to
 

1177
00:23:54,540 --> 00:23:56,690
programmer but it was a lot of fun to
write code and in the early days there

1178
00:23:56,690 --> 00:23:56,700
write code and in the early days there
 

1179
00:23:56,700 --> 00:23:57,890
write code and in the early days there
was an enormous amount of what you would

1180
00:23:57,890 --> 00:23:57,900
was an enormous amount of what you would
 

1181
00:23:57,900 --> 00:24:00,020
was an enormous amount of what you would
today I suppose called low-hanging fruit

1182
00:24:00,020 --> 00:24:00,030
today I suppose called low-hanging fruit
 

1183
00:24:00,030 --> 00:24:02,600
today I suppose called low-hanging fruit
people hadn't done things before and

1184
00:24:02,600 --> 00:24:02,610
people hadn't done things before and
 

1185
00:24:02,610 --> 00:24:04,940
people hadn't done things before and
this was this new environment and the

1186
00:24:04,940 --> 00:24:04,950
this was this new environment and the
 

1187
00:24:04,950 --> 00:24:07,730
this was this new environment and the
the whole combination of nice tools and

1188
00:24:07,730 --> 00:24:07,740
the whole combination of nice tools and
 

1189
00:24:07,740 --> 00:24:10,400
the whole combination of nice tools and
very responsive system and tremendous

1190
00:24:10,400 --> 00:24:10,410
very responsive system and tremendous
 

1191
00:24:10,410 --> 00:24:12,950
very responsive system and tremendous
colleagues made it possible to write

1192
00:24:12,950 --> 00:24:12,960
colleagues made it possible to write
 

1193
00:24:12,960 --> 00:24:15,950
colleagues made it possible to write
code you could have an idea in the

1194
00:24:15,950 --> 00:24:15,960
code you could have an idea in the
 

1195
00:24:15,960 --> 00:24:18,110
code you could have an idea in the
morning you could do it and you know an

1196
00:24:18,110 --> 00:24:18,120
morning you could do it and you know an
 

1197
00:24:18,120 --> 00:24:19,310
morning you could do it and you know an
experiment with it you could have

1198
00:24:19,310 --> 00:24:19,320
experiment with it you could have
 

1199
00:24:19,320 --> 00:24:21,380
experiment with it you could have
something limping along that night or

1200
00:24:21,380 --> 00:24:21,390
something limping along that night or
 

1201
00:24:21,390 --> 00:24:23,360
something limping along that night or
the next day and people would react to

1202
00:24:23,360 --> 00:24:23,370
the next day and people would react to
 

1203
00:24:23,370 --> 00:24:24,920
the next day and people would react to
it and they would say oh that's

1204
00:24:24,920 --> 00:24:24,930
it and they would say oh that's
 

1205
00:24:24,930 --> 00:24:25,830
it and they would say oh that's
wonderful

1206
00:24:25,830 --> 00:24:25,840
wonderful
 

1207
00:24:25,840 --> 00:24:27,900
wonderful
but you're really screwed up here and

1208
00:24:27,900 --> 00:24:27,910
but you're really screwed up here and
 

1209
00:24:27,910 --> 00:24:30,480
but you're really screwed up here and
and the feedback Luke was then very very

1210
00:24:30,480 --> 00:24:30,490
and the feedback Luke was then very very
 

1211
00:24:30,490 --> 00:24:32,730
and the feedback Luke was then very very
short and tight and so a lot of things

1212
00:24:32,730 --> 00:24:32,740
short and tight and so a lot of things
 

1213
00:24:32,740 --> 00:24:37,650
short and tight and so a lot of things
got developed fairly quickly that in

1214
00:24:37,650 --> 00:24:37,660
got developed fairly quickly that in
 

1215
00:24:37,660 --> 00:24:40,290
got developed fairly quickly that in
many cases still exists today and I

1216
00:24:40,290 --> 00:24:40,300
many cases still exists today and I
 

1217
00:24:40,300 --> 00:24:42,780
many cases still exists today and I
think that was part of what made it fun

1218
00:24:42,780 --> 00:24:42,790
think that was part of what made it fun
 

1219
00:24:42,790 --> 00:24:44,790
think that was part of what made it fun
because programming itself is fun it's

1220
00:24:44,790 --> 00:24:44,800
because programming itself is fun it's
 

1221
00:24:44,800 --> 00:24:47,010
because programming itself is fun it's
puzzle solving in a variety of ways but

1222
00:24:47,010 --> 00:24:47,020
puzzle solving in a variety of ways but
 

1223
00:24:47,020 --> 00:24:48,900
puzzle solving in a variety of ways but
I think it's even more fun when you do

1224
00:24:48,900 --> 00:24:48,910
I think it's even more fun when you do
 

1225
00:24:48,910 --> 00:24:51,720
I think it's even more fun when you do
something that somebody else then uses

1226
00:24:51,720 --> 00:24:51,730
something that somebody else then uses
 

1227
00:24:51,730 --> 00:24:54,300
something that somebody else then uses
even if they whine about it not working

1228
00:24:54,300 --> 00:24:54,310
even if they whine about it not working
 

1229
00:24:54,310 --> 00:24:57,270
even if they whine about it not working
the fact that they used it is as part of

1230
00:24:57,270 --> 00:24:57,280
the fact that they used it is as part of
 

1231
00:24:57,280 --> 00:24:59,100
the fact that they used it is as part of
the reward mechanism and what was the

1232
00:24:59,100 --> 00:24:59,110
the reward mechanism and what was the
 

1233
00:24:59,110 --> 00:25:00,540
the reward mechanism and what was the
method of an interaction the

1234
00:25:00,540 --> 00:25:00,550
method of an interaction the
 

1235
00:25:00,550 --> 00:25:02,700
method of an interaction the
communication we need that feedback loop

1236
00:25:02,700 --> 00:25:02,710
communication we need that feedback loop
 

1237
00:25:02,710 --> 00:25:04,860
communication we need that feedback loop
I mean this is before the internet

1238
00:25:04,860 --> 00:25:04,870
I mean this is before the internet
 

1239
00:25:04,870 --> 00:25:08,300
I mean this is before the internet
certainly before the internet um it was

1240
00:25:08,300 --> 00:25:08,310
certainly before the internet um it was
 

1241
00:25:08,310 --> 00:25:11,580
certainly before the internet um it was
mostly physical right there you know

1242
00:25:11,580 --> 00:25:11,590
mostly physical right there you know
 

1243
00:25:11,590 --> 00:25:12,840
mostly physical right there you know
somebody would come into your office and

1244
00:25:12,840 --> 00:25:12,850
somebody would come into your office and
 

1245
00:25:12,850 --> 00:25:14,640
somebody would come into your office and
say something so these places are all

1246
00:25:14,640 --> 00:25:14,650
say something so these places are all
 

1247
00:25:14,650 --> 00:25:16,950
say something so these places are all
closed but like offices are nearby we're

1248
00:25:16,950 --> 00:25:16,960
closed but like offices are nearby we're
 

1249
00:25:16,960 --> 00:25:19,380
closed but like offices are nearby we're
really lively into interaction yeah yeah

1250
00:25:19,380 --> 00:25:19,390
really lively into interaction yeah yeah
 

1251
00:25:19,390 --> 00:25:21,480
really lively into interaction yeah yeah
no Bell Labs was fundamentally one giant

1252
00:25:21,480 --> 00:25:21,490
no Bell Labs was fundamentally one giant
 

1253
00:25:21,490 --> 00:25:23,130
no Bell Labs was fundamentally one giant
building and most of the people were

1254
00:25:23,130 --> 00:25:23,140
building and most of the people were
 

1255
00:25:23,140 --> 00:25:24,750
building and most of the people were
involved in this unique stuff we're in

1256
00:25:24,750 --> 00:25:24,760
involved in this unique stuff we're in
 

1257
00:25:24,760 --> 00:25:26,280
involved in this unique stuff we're in
two or three quarters and there was a

1258
00:25:26,280 --> 00:25:26,290
two or three quarters and there was a
 

1259
00:25:26,290 --> 00:25:27,000
two or three quarters and there was a
room

1260
00:25:27,000 --> 00:25:27,010
room
 

1261
00:25:27,010 --> 00:25:31,590
room

long time all on one machine so there
 

1279
00:25:54,820 --> 00:25:56,580

yeah well how does that make you feel

1300
00:26:19,290 --> 00:26:19,300
yeah well how does that make you feel
 

1301
00:26:19,300 --> 00:26:22,770
yeah well how does that make you feel
that that's a little element of history

well I think that's very nice but in a
sense it's survivor bias and if it

MIT was obviously no slouch in this kind

00:28:51,500 --> 00:28:52,540
so on were there and so he was able to
build

1418
00:28:52,540 --> 00:28:52,550
build
 

1419
00:28:52,550 --> 00:28:54,730
build
an operating system that at this point

1420
00:28:54,730 --> 00:28:54,740
an operating system that at this point
 

1421
00:28:54,740 --> 00:28:57,100
an operating system that at this point
when you say UNIX in many cases what

1422
00:28:57,100 --> 00:28:57,110
when you say UNIX in many cases what
 

1423
00:28:57,110 --> 00:28:58,510
when you say UNIX in many cases what
you're really thinking is Linux Linux

1424
00:28:58,510 --> 00:28:58,520
you're really thinking is Linux Linux
 

1425
00:28:58,520 --> 00:29:01,450
you're really thinking is Linux Linux
yeah but it's it's funny that from my

1426
00:29:01,450 --> 00:29:01,460
yeah but it's it's funny that from my
 

1427
00:29:01,460 --> 00:29:03,790
yeah but it's it's funny that from my
distant perception I felt that UNIX was

1428
00:29:03,790 --> 00:29:03,800
distant perception I felt that UNIX was
 

1429
00:29:03,800 --> 00:29:06,820
distant perception I felt that UNIX was
open-source without actually knowing it

1430
00:29:06,820 --> 00:29:06,830
open-source without actually knowing it
 

1431
00:29:06,830 --> 00:29:09,100
open-source without actually knowing it
but what you're really saying it was

1432
00:29:09,100 --> 00:29:09,110
but what you're really saying it was
 

1433
00:29:09,110 --> 00:29:12,250
but what you're really saying it was
just freely licensed so it was freely

1434
00:29:12,250 --> 00:29:12,260
just freely licensed so it was freely
 

1435
00:29:12,260 --> 00:29:14,710
just freely licensed so it was freely
licensed it felt open-source in a sense

1436
00:29:14,710 --> 00:29:14,720
licensed it felt open-source in a sense
 

1437
00:29:14,720 --> 00:29:16,480
licensed it felt open-source in a sense
because universities are not trying to

1438
00:29:16,480 --> 00:29:16,490
because universities are not trying to
 

1439
00:29:16,490 --> 00:29:18,490
because universities are not trying to
make money so there it felt open-source

1440
00:29:18,490 --> 00:29:18,500
make money so there it felt open-source
 

1441
00:29:18,500 --> 00:29:19,990
make money so there it felt open-source
in a sense that you can get access if

1442
00:29:19,990 --> 00:29:20,000
in a sense that you can get access if
 

1443
00:29:20,000 --> 00:29:22,450
in a sense that you can get access if
you wanted right and a very very very

1444
00:29:22,450 --> 00:29:22,460
you wanted right and a very very very
 

1445
00:29:22,460 --> 00:29:23,920
you wanted right and a very very very
large number of universities had the

1446
00:29:23,920 --> 00:29:23,930
large number of universities had the
 

1447
00:29:23,930 --> 00:29:25,210
large number of universities had the
license and they were able to talk to

1448
00:29:25,210 --> 00:29:25,220
license and they were able to talk to
 

1449
00:29:25,220 --> 00:29:26,710
license and they were able to talk to
all the other universities who had the

1450
00:29:26,710 --> 00:29:26,720
all the other universities who had the
 

1451
00:29:26,720 --> 00:29:30,070
all the other universities who had the
license and so technically not open

1452
00:29:30,070 --> 00:29:30,080
license and so technically not open
 

1453
00:29:30,080 --> 00:29:31,830
license and so technically not open
technically belonging day T&T

1454
00:29:31,830 --> 00:29:31,840
technically belonging day T&T
 

1455
00:29:31,840 --> 00:29:35,290
technically belonging day T&T
pragmatically pretty open and so there's

1456
00:29:35,290 --> 00:29:35,300
pragmatically pretty open and so there's
 

1457
00:29:35,300 --> 00:29:37,420
pragmatically pretty open and so there's
a ripple effect that all the faculty and

1458
00:29:37,420 --> 00:29:37,430
a ripple effect that all the faculty and
 

1459
00:29:37,430 --> 00:29:39,270
a ripple effect that all the faculty and
the students then I'll grew up and then

1460
00:29:39,270 --> 00:29:39,280
the students then I'll grew up and then
 

1461
00:29:39,280 --> 00:29:43,080
the students then I'll grew up and then
they went throughout the world and

1462
00:29:43,080 --> 00:29:43,090
they went throughout the world and
 

1463
00:29:43,090 --> 00:29:46,590
they went throughout the world and
permeated in that kind of way so what

1464
00:29:46,590 --> 00:29:46,600
permeated in that kind of way so what
 

1465
00:29:46,600 --> 00:29:49,990
permeated in that kind of way so what
kind of features do you think made for a

1466
00:29:49,990 --> 00:29:50,000
kind of features do you think made for a
 

1467
00:29:50,000 --> 00:29:53,170
kind of features do you think made for a
good operating system if you take the

1468
00:29:53,170 --> 00:29:53,180
good operating system if you take the
 

1469
00:29:53,180 --> 00:29:56,560
good operating system if you take the
lessons of Unix you said like you know

1470
00:29:56,560 --> 00:29:56,570
lessons of Unix you said like you know
 

1471
00:29:56,570 --> 00:30:00,130
lessons of Unix you said like you know
make it easy for programmers like that

1472
00:30:00,130 --> 00:30:00,140
make it easy for programmers like that
 

1473
00:30:00,140 --> 00:30:04,300
make it easy for programmers like that
seems to be an important one but also

1474
00:30:04,300 --> 00:30:04,310
seems to be an important one but also
 

1475
00:30:04,310 --> 00:30:06,340
seems to be an important one but also
UNIX turned out to be exceptionally

1476
00:30:06,340 --> 00:30:06,350
UNIX turned out to be exceptionally
 

1477
00:30:06,350 --> 00:30:09,880
UNIX turned out to be exceptionally
robust and efficient right so is that an

1478
00:30:09,880 --> 00:30:09,890
robust and efficient right so is that an
 

1479
00:30:09,890 --> 00:30:11,410
robust and efficient right so is that an
accident when you focus on the

1480
00:30:11,410 --> 00:30:11,420
accident when you focus on the
 

1481
00:30:11,420 --> 00:30:14,080
accident when you focus on the
programmer or is that a natural outcome

1482
00:30:14,080 --> 00:30:14,090
programmer or is that a natural outcome
 

1483
00:30:14,090 --> 00:30:16,450
programmer or is that a natural outcome
I think part of the reason for

1484
00:30:16,450 --> 00:30:16,460
I think part of the reason for
 

1485
00:30:16,460 --> 00:30:18,910
I think part of the reason for
efficiency was that it began on

1486
00:30:18,910 --> 00:30:18,920
efficiency was that it began on
 

1487
00:30:18,920 --> 00:30:22,090
efficiency was that it began on
extremely modest hardware very very very

1488
00:30:22,090 --> 00:30:22,100
extremely modest hardware very very very
 

1489
00:30:22,100 --> 00:30:23,710
extremely modest hardware very very very
tiny and so you couldn't get carried

1490
00:30:23,710 --> 00:30:23,720
tiny and so you couldn't get carried
 

1491
00:30:23,720 --> 00:30:25,300
tiny and so you couldn't get carried
away you couldn't do a lot of

1492
00:30:25,300 --> 00:30:25,310
away you couldn't do a lot of
 

1493
00:30:25,310 --> 00:30:28,900
away you couldn't do a lot of
complicated things because you just

1494
00:30:28,900 --> 00:30:28,910
complicated things because you just
 

1495
00:30:28,910 --> 00:30:30,130
complicated things because you just
didn't have the resources either

1496
00:30:30,130 --> 00:30:30,140
didn't have the resources either
 

1497
00:30:30,140 --> 00:30:32,980
didn't have the resources either
processor speed or memory and so that

1498
00:30:32,980 --> 00:30:32,990
processor speed or memory and so that
 

1499
00:30:32,990 --> 00:30:36,090

enforced a certain minimal 'ti of
 

1501
00:30:36,100 --> 00:30:38,920
enforced a certain minimal 'ti of

1502
00:30:38,920 --> 00:30:38,930
mechanisms and maybe a search for
 

1503
00:30:38,930 --> 00:30:40,990
mechanisms and maybe a search for
generalizations so that you would find

1504
00:30:40,990 --> 00:30:41,000
generalizations so that you would find
 

1505
00:30:41,000 --> 00:30:42,940
generalizations so that you would find
one mechanism that's served for a lot of

one mechanism that's served for a lot of

one mechanism that's served for a lot of
different things rather than having lots

00:30:44,290 --> 00:30:44,300
different things rather than having lots
 

1509
00:30:44,300 --> 00:30:46,180
different things rather than having lots
of different special cases I think the

1510
00:30:46,180 --> 00:30:46,190
of different special cases I think the
 

1511
00:30:46,190 --> 00:30:48,580
of different special cases I think the
file system and UNIX is a good example

1512
00:30:48,580 --> 00:30:48,590
file system and UNIX is a good example
 

1513
00:30:48,590 --> 00:30:50,650
file system and UNIX is a good example
of that file system interface in its

1514
00:30:50,650 --> 00:30:50,660
of that file system interface in its
 

1515
00:30:50,660 --> 00:30:52,330
of that file system interface in its
fundamental form is extremely

1516
00:30:52,330 --> 00:30:52,340
fundamental form is extremely
 

1517
00:30:52,340 --> 00:30:54,670
fundamental form is extremely
straightforward and that means that you

1518
00:30:54,670 --> 00:30:54,680
straightforward and that means that you
 

1519
00:30:54,680 --> 00:30:57,460
straightforward and that means that you
can write code very very effectively

1520
00:30:57,460 --> 00:30:57,470
can write code very very effectively
 

1521
00:30:57,470 --> 00:30:59,770
can write code very very effectively
from for the file system and then one of

1522
00:30:59,770 --> 00:30:59,780
from for the file system and then one of
 

1523
00:30:59,780 --> 00:31:01,110
from for the file system and then one of
those ideas and one of those

1524
00:31:01,110 --> 00:31:01,120
those ideas and one of those
 

1525
00:31:01,120 --> 00:31:03,760
those ideas and one of those
generalizations is that gee that file

1526
00:31:03,760 --> 00:31:03,770
generalizations is that gee that file
 

1527
00:31:03,770 --> 00:31:05,530
generalizations is that gee that file
system interface works for all kinds of

1528
00:31:05,530 --> 00:31:05,540
system interface works for all kinds of
 

1529
00:31:05,540 --> 00:31:06,430
system interface works for all kinds of
other things as

1530
00:31:06,430 --> 00:31:06,440
other things as
 

1531
00:31:06,440 --> 00:31:08,830
other things as
well and so in particular the idea of

1532
00:31:08,830 --> 00:31:08,840
well and so in particular the idea of
 

1533
00:31:08,840 --> 00:31:10,749
well and so in particular the idea of
reading and writing to devices is the

1534
00:31:10,749 --> 00:31:10,759
reading and writing to devices is the
 

1535
00:31:10,759 --> 00:31:12,549
reading and writing to devices is the
same as reading and writing to a disk

1536
00:31:12,549 --> 00:31:12,559
same as reading and writing to a disk
 

1537
00:31:12,559 --> 00:31:15,190
same as reading and writing to a disk
that has a file system and then that

1538
00:31:15,190 --> 00:31:15,200
that has a file system and then that
 

1539
00:31:15,200 --> 00:31:17,830
that has a file system and then that
gets carried further in other parts of

1540
00:31:17,830 --> 00:31:17,840
gets carried further in other parts of

00:31:17,840 --> 00:31:21,399
gets carried further in other parts of
the world processes become in effect

1542
00:31:21,399 --> 00:31:21,409
the world processes become in effect
 

1543
00:31:21,409 --> 00:31:24,850
the world processes become in effect
files in a file system and the plan 9

1544
00:31:24,850 --> 00:31:24,860
files in a file system and the plan 9
 

1545
00:31:24,860 --> 00:31:26,499
files in a file system and the plan 9
operating system which came along I

1546
00:31:26,499 --> 00:31:26,509
operating system which came along I
 

1547
00:31:26,509 --> 00:31:27,999
operating system which came along I
guess in the late 80s or something like

1548
00:31:27,999 --> 00:31:28,009
guess in the late 80s or something like
 

1549
00:31:28,009 --> 00:31:28,570
guess in the late 80s or something like
that

1550
00:31:28,570 --> 00:31:28,580
that
 

1551
00:31:28,580 --> 00:31:30,789
that
took a lot of those ideas from the

1552
00:31:30,789 --> 00:31:30,799
took a lot of those ideas from the
 

1553
00:31:30,799 --> 00:31:33,070
took a lot of those ideas from the
original unix and tried to push the

1554
00:31:33,070 --> 00:31:33,080
original unix and tried to push the
 

1555
00:31:33,080 --> 00:31:35,259
original unix and tried to push the
generalization even further so that in

1556
00:31:35,259 --> 00:31:35,269
generalization even further so that in
 

1557
00:31:35,269 --> 00:31:37,330
generalization even further so that in
plan 9 a lot of different resources our

1558
00:31:37,330 --> 00:31:37,340
plan 9 a lot of different resources our
 

1559
00:31:37,340 --> 00:31:38,769
plan 9 a lot of different resources our
file systems they all share that

1560
00:31:38,769 --> 00:31:38,779
file systems they all share that
 

1561
00:31:38,779 --> 00:31:41,430
file systems they all share that
interface so that would be one example

1562
00:31:41,430 --> 00:31:41,440
interface so that would be one example
 

1563
00:31:41,440 --> 00:31:44,590
interface so that would be one example
we're finding the right model of how to

1564
00:31:44,590 --> 00:31:44,600
we're finding the right model of how to
 

1565
00:31:44,600 --> 00:31:46,450
we're finding the right model of how to
do something means that an awful lot of

1566
00:31:46,450 --> 00:31:46,460
do something means that an awful lot of
 

1567
00:31:46,460 --> 00:31:48,399
do something means that an awful lot of
things become simpler and it means

1568
00:31:48,399 --> 00:31:48,409
things become simpler and it means
 

1569
00:31:48,409 --> 00:31:50,200
things become simpler and it means
therefore that more people can do useful

1570
00:31:50,200 --> 00:31:50,210
therefore that more people can do useful
 

1571
00:31:50,210 --> 00:31:52,119
therefore that more people can do useful
interesting things with them without him

00:31:52,119 --> 00:31:52,129
interesting things with them without him
 

1573
00:31:52,129 --> 00:31:54,909
interesting things with them without him
to think as hard about it so you said

1574
00:31:54,909 --> 00:31:54,919
to think as hard about it so you said
 

1575
00:31:54,919 --> 00:31:58,930
to think as hard about it so you said
you're not a very good programmer you're

1576
00:31:58,930 --> 00:31:58,940
you're not a very good programmer you're
 

1577
00:31:58,940 --> 00:32:01,570
you're not a very good programmer you're
the most modest human being ok but

1578
00:32:01,570 --> 00:32:01,580
the most modest human being ok but
 

1579
00:32:01,580 --> 00:32:03,789
the most modest human being ok but
you'll continue saying that I understand

1580
00:32:03,789 --> 00:32:03,799
you'll continue saying that I understand
 

1581
00:32:03,799 --> 00:32:06,129
you'll continue saying that I understand
how this works but you do radiate a sort

1582
00:32:06,129 --> 00:32:06,139
how this works but you do radiate a sort
 

1583
00:32:06,139 --> 00:32:09,940
how this works but you do radiate a sort
of love for programming so let me ask do

1584
00:32:09,940 --> 00:32:09,950
of love for programming so let me ask do
 

1585
00:32:09,950 --> 00:32:12,490
of love for programming so let me ask do
you think programming is more an art or

1586
00:32:12,490 --> 00:32:12,500
you think programming is more an art or
 

1587
00:32:12,500 --> 00:32:15,430
you think programming is more an art or
science there's a creativity or kind of

1588
00:32:15,430 --> 00:32:15,440
science there's a creativity or kind of
 

1589
00:32:15,440 --> 00:32:18,190
science there's a creativity or kind of
rigor I think it's some of each it's

1590
00:32:18,190 --> 00:32:18,200
rigor I think it's some of each it's
 

1591
00:32:18,200 --> 00:32:21,519
rigor I think it's some of each it's
some combination some of the art is

1592
00:32:21,519 --> 00:32:21,529
some combination some of the art is
 

1593
00:32:21,529 --> 00:32:22,960
some combination some of the art is
figuring out what it is that did you

1594
00:32:22,960 --> 00:32:22,970
figuring out what it is that did you
 

1595
00:32:22,970 --> 00:32:24,279
figuring out what it is that did you
really want to do what should that

1596
00:32:24,279 --> 00:32:24,289
really want to do what should that
 

1597
00:32:24,289 --> 00:32:26,950
really want to do what should that
program be what would make a good

1598
00:32:26,950 --> 00:32:26,960
program be what would make a good
 

1599
00:32:26,960 --> 00:32:29,259
program be what would make a good
program and that's some understanding of

1600
00:32:29,259 --> 00:32:29,269
program and that's some understanding of
 

1601
00:32:29,269 --> 00:32:31,389
program and that's some understanding of
what the task is what the people who

1602
00:32:31,389 --> 00:32:31,399
what the task is what the people who
 

1603
00:32:31,399 --> 00:32:33,970
what the task is what the people who
might use this program want and I think

1604
00:32:33,970 --> 00:32:33,980
might use this program want and I think
 

1605
00:32:33,980 --> 00:32:37,869
might use this program want and I think
that's that's art in many respects the

1606
00:32:37,869 --> 00:32:37,879
that's that's art in many respects the
 

1607
00:32:37,879 --> 00:32:39,279
that's that's art in many respects the
science part is trying to figure out how

1608
00:32:39,279 --> 00:32:39,289
science part is trying to figure out how
 

1609
00:32:39,289 --> 00:32:43,840
science part is trying to figure out how
to do it well and some of that is a real

1610
00:32:43,840 --> 00:32:43,850
to do it well and some of that is a real
 

1611
00:32:43,850 --> 00:32:45,970
to do it well and some of that is a real
computer science II stuff like what

computer science II stuff like what
 

1613
00:32:45,980 --> 00:32:47,639
computer science II stuff like what
algorithm should we use at some point

same thing for data structures but also

and just kind of evolve iteratively with
 

1675
00:34:00,619 --> 00:34:04,570

1695
00:34:21,980 --> 00:34:24,730

more and then I call it a few hundred or
 

1697
00:34:24,740 --> 00:34:27,399
more and then I call it a few hundred or
more lines something like that many of

you're writing awk scripts because two
 

1729
00:35:01,190 --> 00:35:02,770
you're writing awk scripts because two
or three lines will tell you something

1730
00:35:02,770 --> 00:35:02,780
or three lines will tell you something
 

1731
00:35:02,780 --> 00:35:04,630
or three lines will tell you something
about a piece of data and then when it

1732
00:35:04,630 --> 00:35:04,640
about a piece of data and then when it
 

1733
00:35:04,640 --> 00:35:06,039
about a piece of data and then when it
gets bigger well and I will probably

1734
00:35:06,039 --> 00:35:06,049
gets bigger well and I will probably
 

1735
00:35:06,049 --> 00:35:09,309
gets bigger well and I will probably
write something in Python because that

1736
00:35:09,309 --> 00:35:09,319
write something in Python because that
 

1737
00:35:09,319 --> 00:35:12,250
write something in Python because that
scales better up to call it a few

1738
00:35:12,250 --> 00:35:12,260
scales better up to call it a few
 

1739
00:35:12,260 --> 00:35:14,289
scales better up to call it a few
hundred lines or something like that and

1740
00:35:14,289 --> 00:35:14,299
hundred lines or something like that and
 

1741
00:35:14,299 --> 00:35:15,910
hundred lines or something like that and
it's been a long time since I wrote

1742
00:35:15,910 --> 00:35:15,920
it's been a long time since I wrote
 

1743
00:35:15,920 --> 00:35:18,000
it's been a long time since I wrote
programs that were much more than that

1744
00:35:18,000 --> 00:35:18,010
programs that were much more than that
 

1745
00:35:18,010 --> 00:35:20,280
programs that were much more than that

speaking of data exploration in awk
 

1747
00:35:20,290 --> 00:35:24,760
speaking of data exploration in awk
first what is awk so awk is a scripting

1748
00:35:24,760 --> 00:35:24,770
first what is awk so awk is a scripting

00:35:30,730 --> 00:35:30,740
on Peter Weinberger we did that
 

1753
00:35:30,740 --> 00:35:32,950

00:35:37,630 --> 00:35:37,640
really easy to do quick and dirty tasks
 

1759
00:35:37,640 --> 00:35:40,900
really easy to do quick and dirty tasks
like counting things or selecting

on each line of a file I mean there's uh
it's still exceptionally widely used

it's still exceptionally widely used
 

1771
00:35:54,890 --> 00:35:57,700
it's still exceptionally widely used
today oh absolutely yeah it's so simple

1772
00:35:57,700 --> 00:35:57,710
today oh absolutely yeah it's so simple
 

1773
00:35:57,710 --> 00:36:00,760

an elegant sort of the way to explore

1774
00:36:00,760 --> 00:36:00,770
an elegant sort of the way to explore

an elegant sort of the way to explore
data turns out you can just write a

00:36:02,740 --> 00:36:02,750
data turns out you can just write a
 

1777
00:36:02,750 --> 00:36:05,349
data turns out you can just write a
script that does something seemingly

1778
00:36:05,349 --> 00:36:05,359
script that does something seemingly
 

1779
00:36:05,359 --> 00:36:08,650
script that does something seemingly
trivial on a single line and that giving

1780
00:36:08,650 --> 00:36:08,660
trivial on a single line and that giving
 

1781
00:36:08,660 --> 00:36:10,150
trivial on a single line and that giving
you that slice of the data somehow

1782
00:36:10,150 --> 00:36:10,160
you that slice of the data somehow
 

1783
00:36:10,160 --> 00:36:12,250
you that slice of the data somehow
reveals something fundamental about the

reveals something fundamental about the
 

1785
00:36:12,260 --> 00:36:15,579
reveals something fundamental about the
data you know that keeps that seems to

00:36:15,579 --> 00:36:15,589
data you know that keeps that seems to
 

1787
00:36:15,589 --> 00:36:16,059

work
 

1789
00:36:16,069 --> 00:36:18,609
work
still yeah it's very good for that kind

1790
00:36:18,609 --> 00:36:18,619
still yeah it's very good for that kind
 

1791
00:36:18,619 --> 00:36:20,589
still yeah it's very good for that kind
of thing that's sort of what it was

1792
00:36:20,589 --> 00:36:20,599
of thing that's sort of what it was
 

1793
00:36:20,599 --> 00:36:22,120
of thing that's sort of what it was
meant for I think what we didn't

1794
00:36:22,120 --> 00:36:22,130
meant for I think what we didn't
 

1795
00:36:22,130 --> 00:36:24,040
meant for I think what we didn't
appreciate was that the model is

1796
00:36:24,040 --> 00:36:24,050
appreciate was that the model is
 

1797
00:36:24,050 --> 00:36:26,200
appreciate was that the model is
actually quite good for a lot of data

1798
00:36:26,200 --> 00:36:26,210
actually quite good for a lot of data
 

1799
00:36:26,210 --> 00:36:28,300
actually quite good for a lot of data
processing kinds of tasks and that it's

1800
00:36:28,300 --> 00:36:28,310
processing kinds of tasks and that it's
 

1801
00:36:28,310 --> 00:36:30,700
processing kinds of tasks and that it's
it's kept going as long as it has

1802
00:36:30,700 --> 00:36:30,710
it's kept going as long as it has
 

1803
00:36:30,710 --> 00:36:32,440
it's kept going as long as it has
because at this point it's over 40 years

1804
00:36:32,440 --> 00:36:32,450
because at this point it's over 40 years
 

1805
00:36:32,450 --> 00:36:35,800
because at this point it's over 40 years
old but it's still I think a useful tool

1806
00:36:35,800 --> 00:36:35,810
old but it's still I think a useful tool
 

1807
00:36:35,810 --> 00:36:38,200
old but it's still I think a useful tool
and well this is paternal interest I

1808
00:36:38,200 --> 00:36:38,210
and well this is paternal interest I
 

1809
00:36:38,210 --> 00:36:39,609
and well this is paternal interest I
guess but I think in terms of

1810
00:36:39,609 --> 00:36:39,619
guess but I think in terms of
 

1811
00:36:39,619 --> 00:36:41,530
guess but I think in terms of
programming languages you get the most

1812
00:36:41,530 --> 00:36:41,540
programming languages you get the most
 

1813
00:36:41,540 --> 00:36:44,620
programming languages you get the most
bang for the buck by learning awk and it

1814
00:36:44,620 --> 00:36:44,630
bang for the buck by learning awk and it
 

1815
00:36:44,630 --> 00:36:46,960
bang for the buck by learning awk and it
doesn't scale the big programs but it

1816
00:36:46,960 --> 00:36:46,970
doesn't scale the big programs but it
 

1817
00:36:46,970 --> 00:36:49,120
doesn't scale the big programs but it
does pretty pretty darn well on these

1818
00:36:49,120 --> 00:36:49,130
does pretty pretty darn well on these
 

1819
00:36:49,130 --> 00:36:51,040
does pretty pretty darn well on these
little things where you just want to see

1820
00:36:51,040 --> 00:36:51,050
little things where you just want to see
 

1821
00:36:51,050 --> 00:36:54,309
little things where you just want to see
all the something's in something so yeah

1822
00:36:54,309 --> 00:36:54,319
all the something's in something so yeah
 

1823
00:36:54,319 --> 00:36:56,109
all the something's in something so yeah
I find I probably write more awk than

1824
00:36:56,109 --> 00:36:56,119
I find I probably write more awk than
 

1825
00:36:56,119 --> 00:37:00,069
I find I probably write more awk than
anything so what what kind of stuff do

1826
00:37:00,069 --> 00:37:00,079
anything so what what kind of stuff do
 

1827
00:37:00,079 --> 00:37:02,170
anything so what what kind of stuff do
you love about arc like is there if you

1828
00:37:02,170 --> 00:37:02,180
you love about arc like is there if you
 

1829
00:37:02,180 --> 00:37:07,120
you love about arc like is there if you
can comment on sort of things that give

1830
00:37:07,120 --> 00:37:07,130
can comment on sort of things that give
 

1831
00:37:07,130 --> 00:37:09,849
can comment on sort of things that give
you joy when you can in a simple program

1832
00:37:09,849 --> 00:37:09,859
you joy when you can in a simple program
 

1833
00:37:09,859 --> 00:37:11,859
you joy when you can in a simple program
reveal something about it is there

1834
00:37:11,859 --> 00:37:11,869
reveal something about it is there
 

1835
00:37:11,869 --> 00:37:13,329
reveal something about it is there
something that stands out from

1836
00:37:13,329 --> 00:37:13,339
something that stands out from
 

1837
00:37:13,339 --> 00:37:16,120
something that stands out from
particular features I think it's mostly

1838
00:37:16,120 --> 00:37:16,130
particular features I think it's mostly
 

1839
00:37:16,130 --> 00:37:19,329
particular features I think it's mostly
the selection of default behaviors that

1840
00:37:19,329 --> 00:37:19,339
the selection of default behaviors that
 

1841
00:37:19,339 --> 00:37:21,069
the selection of default behaviors that
you sort of hinted at at a moment ago

1842
00:37:21,069 --> 00:37:21,079
you sort of hinted at at a moment ago
 

1843
00:37:21,079 --> 00:37:23,710
you sort of hinted at at a moment ago
what Octus is to read through a set of

1844
00:37:23,710 --> 00:37:23,720
what Octus is to read through a set of
 

1845
00:37:23,720 --> 00:37:26,530
what Octus is to read through a set of
files and then within each file it rich

1846
00:37:26,530 --> 00:37:26,540
files and then within each file it rich
 

1847
00:37:26,540 --> 00:37:28,930
files and then within each file it rich
through a each of the lines and then on

1848
00:37:28,930 --> 00:37:28,940
through a each of the lines and then on
 

1849
00:37:28,940 --> 00:37:30,970
through a each of the lines and then on
each of the lines it has a set of

1850
00:37:30,970 --> 00:37:30,980
each of the lines it has a set of
 

1851
00:37:30,980 --> 00:37:33,370
each of the lines it has a set of
patterns that it looks for that's your

1852
00:37:33,370 --> 00:37:33,380
patterns that it looks for that's your
 

1853
00:37:33,380 --> 00:37:36,339
patterns that it looks for that's your
arc program and if one of the patterns

1854
00:37:36,339 --> 00:37:36,349
arc program and if one of the patterns
 

1855
00:37:36,349 --> 00:37:38,620
arc program and if one of the patterns
matches there is a corresponding action

1856
00:37:38,620 --> 00:37:38,630
matches there is a corresponding action
 

1857
00:37:38,630 --> 00:37:40,900
matches there is a corresponding action
that you might perform and so it's kind

1858
00:37:40,900 --> 00:37:40,910
that you might perform and so it's kind
 

1859
00:37:40,910 --> 00:37:43,690
that you might perform and so it's kind
of a quadruply nested loop or something

1860
00:37:43,690 --> 00:37:43,700
of a quadruply nested loop or something
 

1861
00:37:43,700 --> 00:37:46,089
of a quadruply nested loop or something
like that um and that's all completely

1862
00:37:46,089 --> 00:37:46,099
like that um and that's all completely
 

1863
00:37:46,099 --> 00:37:47,650
like that um and that's all completely
automatic you don't have to say any

1864
00:37:47,650 --> 00:37:47,660
automatic you don't have to say any
 

1865
00:37:47,660 --> 00:37:48,760
automatic you don't have to say any
think about it you just write the

1866
00:37:48,760 --> 00:37:48,770
think about it you just write the
 

1867
00:37:48,770 --> 00:37:51,309
think about it you just write the
pattern in the action and then run the

1868
00:37:51,309 --> 00:37:51,319
pattern in the action and then run the
 

1869
00:37:51,319 --> 00:37:53,710
pattern in the action and then run the
data by it and and so that paradigm for

1870
00:37:53,710 --> 00:37:53,720
data by it and and so that paradigm for
 

1871
00:37:53,720 --> 00:37:55,720
data by it and and so that paradigm for
programming is very natural and

1872
00:37:55,720 --> 00:37:55,730
programming is very natural and
 

1873
00:37:55,730 --> 00:37:57,910
programming is very natural and
effective one and I think we captured

1874
00:37:57,910 --> 00:37:57,920
effective one and I think we captured
 

1875
00:37:57,920 --> 00:38:00,430
effective one and I think we captured
that reasonably well and lock and it

1876
00:38:00,430 --> 00:38:00,440
that reasonably well and lock and it
 

1877
00:38:00,440 --> 00:38:02,020
that reasonably well and lock and it
does other things for free as well it

1878
00:38:02,020 --> 00:38:02,030
does other things for free as well it
 

1879
00:38:02,030 --> 00:38:04,720
does other things for free as well it
splits the data into fields so that on

1880
00:38:04,720 --> 00:38:04,730
splits the data into fields so that on
 

1881
00:38:04,730 --> 00:38:06,640
splits the data into fields so that on
each line there feels separated by white

1882
00:38:06,640 --> 00:38:06,650
each line there feels separated by white
 

1883
00:38:06,650 --> 00:38:08,319
each line there feels separated by white
space or something and so it does that

1884
00:38:08,319 --> 00:38:08,329
space or something and so it does that
 

1885
00:38:08,329 --> 00:38:09,640
space or something and so it does that
for free you don't have to say anything

1886
00:38:09,640 --> 00:38:09,650
for free you don't have to say anything
 

1887
00:38:09,650 --> 00:38:13,059
for free you don't have to say anything
about it and it collects information it

1888
00:38:13,059 --> 00:38:13,069
about it and it collects information it
 

1889
00:38:13,069 --> 00:38:15,400
about it and it collects information it
goes along like what line are we on how

1890
00:38:15,400 --> 00:38:15,410
goes along like what line are we on how
 

1891
00:38:15,410 --> 00:38:18,160
goes along like what line are we on how
many fields are there on this line so

1892
00:38:18,160 --> 00:38:18,170
many fields are there on this line so
 

1893
00:38:18,170 --> 00:38:20,049
many fields are there on this line so
lots of things that just make it so that

00:38:20,049 --> 00:38:20,059
lots of things that just make it so that

let's say Python would be 5 10 20 lines
 

1899

let's say Python would be 5 10 20 lines
in Arcis one or two lines and so because

1900
00:38:28,630 --> 00:38:28,640
in Arcis one or two lines and so because
 

1901
00:38:28,640 --> 00:38:30,309
in Arcis one or two lines and so because
it's one or two lines you can do it on

1902
00:38:30,309 --> 00:38:30,319
it's one or two lines you can do it on
 

1903
00:38:30,319 --> 00:38:32,680
it's one or two lines you can do it on
the shell you don't have to open up

1904
00:38:32,680 --> 00:38:32,690
the shell you don't have to open up
 

1905
00:38:32,690 --> 00:38:34,299
the shell you don't have to open up
another whole thing you can just do it

00:38:34,299 --> 00:38:34,309
another whole thing you can just do it
 

1907
00:38:34,309 --> 00:38:36,460
another whole thing you can just do it
right there and the interaction with

00:38:36,460 --> 00:38:36,470
right there and the interaction with
 

1909
00:38:36,470 --> 00:38:40,480
right there and the interaction with
Allah perfectly is there other shell

commands that you love over the years

1912
00:38:44,799 --> 00:38:44,809
commands that you love over the years
 

1913
00:38:44,809 --> 00:38:49,319
commands that you love over the years
like you really enjoy using don't major

1914

1915
00:38:49,329 --> 00:38:52,420

does everything so grep is a kind of

1916
00:38:52,420 --> 00:38:52,430
does everything so grep is a kind of

00:38:52,430 --> 00:38:54,849
does everything so grep is a kind of
what is it a simpler version of awk I

1918
00:38:54,849 --> 00:38:54,859
what is it a simpler version of awk I
 

1919
00:38:54,859 --> 00:38:57,460
what is it a simpler version of awk I
would say in some some sense yeah right

1920
00:38:57,460 --> 00:38:57,470
would say in some some sense yeah right
 

1921
00:38:57,470 --> 00:38:59,980
would say in some some sense yeah right
because what is grep so grep is it

1922
00:38:59,980 --> 00:38:59,990
because what is grep so grep is it
 

1923
00:38:59,990 --> 00:39:02,079
because what is grep so grep is it
basically searches the input for

1924
00:39:02,079 --> 00:39:02,089
basically searches the input for
 

1925
00:39:02,089 --> 00:39:03,910
basically searches the input for
particular patterns regular expressions

1926
00:39:03,910 --> 00:39:03,920
particular patterns regular expressions
 

1927
00:39:03,920 --> 00:39:06,430
particular patterns regular expressions
technically of a certain class and it

1928
00:39:06,430 --> 00:39:06,440
technically of a certain class and it
 

1929
00:39:06,440 --> 00:39:08,500
technically of a certain class and it
has that same paradigm that awk does

1930
00:39:08,500 --> 00:39:08,510
has that same paradigm that awk does
 

1931
00:39:08,510 --> 00:39:10,359
has that same paradigm that awk does
it's a pattern action thing it reads

1932
00:39:10,359 --> 00:39:10,369
it's a pattern action thing it reads
 

1933
00:39:10,369 --> 00:39:12,309
it's a pattern action thing it reads
through all the files and then all the

1934
00:39:12,309 --> 00:39:12,319
through all the files and then all the
 

1935
00:39:12,319 --> 00:39:14,380
through all the files and then all the
lines in each file but it has a single

1936
00:39:14,380 --> 00:39:14,390
lines in each file but it has a single
 

1937
00:39:14,390 --> 00:39:15,940
lines in each file but it has a single
pattern which is the regular expression

1938
00:39:15,940 --> 00:39:15,950
pattern which is the regular expression
 

1939
00:39:15,950 --> 00:39:17,740
pattern which is the regular expression
you're looking for and a single action

1940
00:39:17,740 --> 00:39:17,750
you're looking for and a single action
 

1941
00:39:17,750 --> 00:39:21,130
you're looking for and a single action
printed if it matches so it's a in that

1942
00:39:21,130 --> 00:39:21,140
printed if it matches so it's a in that
 

1943
00:39:21,140 --> 00:39:22,720
printed if it matches so it's a in that
sense it's a much simpler version and

1944
00:39:22,720 --> 00:39:22,730
sense it's a much simpler version and
 

1945
00:39:22,730 --> 00:39:24,730
sense it's a much simpler version and
you could write crap in Arcis as a

00:39:24,730 --> 00:39:24,740
you could write crap in Arcis as a
 

1947
00:39:24,740 --> 00:39:29,349
you could write crap in Arcis as a
one-liner and I use grep probably more

1948
00:39:29,349 --> 00:39:29,359
one-liner and I use grep probably more
 

1949
00:39:29,359 --> 00:39:32,170
one-liner and I use grep probably more
than anything else at this point just

1950
00:39:32,170 --> 00:39:32,180
than anything else at this point just
 

1951
00:39:32,180 --> 00:39:34,120
than anything else at this point just

because it it's so convenient and

00:39:34,130 --> 00:39:36,549
because it it's so convenient and
natural why do you think it's such a

natural why do you think it's such a
powerful tool grab not why do you think

and I think Microsoft spent a lot of
 

2003

right and what they did now you

could load a file and then you could
 

2189
00:44:36,910 --> 00:44:38,430

00:44:38,440 --> 00:44:40,859
talk about the lines one through the
last line and you could you know print

2192
00:44:40,859 --> 00:44:40,869
last line and you could you know print
 

2193
00:44:40,869 --> 00:44:43,109
last line and you could you know print
ranges of lines you could add text you

2194
00:44:43,109 --> 00:44:43,119
ranges of lines you could add text you
 

2195
00:44:43,119 --> 00:44:44,849
ranges of lines you could add text you
could delete text you could change text

2196
00:44:44,849 --> 00:44:44,859
could delete text you could change text
 

2197
00:44:44,859 --> 00:44:46,410
could delete text you could change text
or you could do a substitute command

2198
00:44:46,410 --> 00:44:46,420
or you could do a substitute command
 

2199
00:44:46,420 --> 00:44:47,849
or you could do a substitute command
that would change things within a line

2200
00:44:47,849 --> 00:44:47,859
that would change things within a line
 

2201
00:44:47,859 --> 00:44:49,680
that would change things within a line
or within groups of lines they can work

2202
00:44:49,680 --> 00:44:49,690
or within groups of lines they can work
 

2203
00:44:49,690 --> 00:44:51,420
or within groups of lines they can work
on a parts of a file essentially yeah

2204
00:44:51,420 --> 00:44:51,430
on a parts of a file essentially yeah
 

2205
00:44:51,430 --> 00:44:53,099
on a parts of a file essentially yeah
you could work on any part of it the

2206
00:44:53,099 --> 00:44:53,109
you could work on any part of it the
 

2207
00:44:53,109 --> 00:44:55,609
you could work on any part of it the
whole thing whatever but it was entirely

2208
00:44:55,609 --> 00:44:55,619
whole thing whatever but it was entirely
 

2209
00:44:55,619 --> 00:44:58,140
whole thing whatever but it was entirely
command line based and it was entirely

2210
00:44:58,140 --> 00:44:58,150
command line based and it was entirely
 

2211
00:44:58,150 --> 00:45:02,099
command line based and it was entirely
on paper okay paper and that meant that

2212
00:45:02,099 --> 00:45:02,109
on paper okay paper and that meant that
 

2213
00:45:02,109 --> 00:45:04,200
on paper okay paper and that meant that
you've changed yeah right real paper and

2214
00:45:04,200 --> 00:45:04,210
you've changed yeah right real paper and
 

2215
00:45:04,210 --> 00:45:06,420
you've changed yeah right real paper and
so if you changed the line you had to

2216
00:45:06,420 --> 00:45:06,430
so if you changed the line you had to
 

2217
00:45:06,430 --> 00:45:08,670
so if you changed the line you had to
print that line using up another line of

2218
00:45:08,670 --> 00:45:08,680
print that line using up another line of
 

2219
00:45:08,680 --> 00:45:11,279
print that line using up another line of
paper to see what changed cause okay

2220
00:45:11,279 --> 00:45:11,289
paper to see what changed cause okay
 

2221
00:45:11,289 --> 00:45:12,329
paper to see what changed cause okay
yeah

2222
00:45:12,329 --> 00:45:12,339
yeah
 

2223
00:45:12,339 --> 00:45:15,660
yeah
so when thing when CRT displays came

2224
00:45:15,660 --> 00:45:15,670
so when thing when CRT displays came
 

2225
00:45:15,670 --> 00:45:18,930
so when thing when CRT displays came
along yeah then you could start to use

2226
00:45:18,930 --> 00:45:18,940
along yeah then you could start to use
 

2227
00:45:18,940 --> 00:45:20,400
along yeah then you could start to use
cursor control and you could sort of

2228
00:45:20,400 --> 00:45:20,410
cursor control and you could sort of
 

2229
00:45:20,410 --> 00:45:23,509
cursor control and you could sort of
move where you where on the screen in

2230
00:45:23,509 --> 00:45:23,519
move where you where on the screen in
 

2231
00:45:23,519 --> 00:45:28,079
move where you where on the screen in

there were a number of editors there the

2234
00:45:29,940 --> 00:45:29,950
there were a number of editors there the
 

2235
00:45:29,950 --> 00:45:31,620
there were a number of editors there the
one that I was most familiar with and

2236
00:45:31,620 --> 00:45:31,630
one that I was most familiar with and
 

2237
00:45:31,630 --> 00:45:34,170
one that I was most familiar with and
still use is VI which was done by bill

2238
00:45:34,170 --> 00:45:34,180
still use is VI which was done by bill
 

2239
00:45:34,180 --> 00:45:38,519

joy and so that dates from probably the

2240
00:45:38,519 --> 00:45:38,529
joy and so that dates from probably the
 

2241
00:45:38,529 --> 00:45:43,319
joy and so that dates from probably the
late 70s as a guess and it took at full

00:45:43,319 --> 00:45:43,329
late 70s as a guess and it took at full
 

2243
00:45:43,329 --> 00:45:45,209
late 70s as a guess and it took at full
advantage of the cursor controls I

2244
00:45:45,209 --> 00:45:45,219
advantage of the cursor controls I

advantage of the cursor controls I
suspected Emacs was roughly at the same

2246
00:45:48,029 --> 00:45:48,039
suspected Emacs was roughly at the same
 

2247
00:45:48,039 --> 00:45:49,249
suspected Emacs was roughly at the same
time but I don't know I've never

2248
00:45:49,249 --> 00:45:49,259
time but I don't know I've never
 

2249
00:45:49,259 --> 00:45:53,309
time but I don't know I've never
internalized Emacs so so I use at this

2250
00:45:53,309 --> 00:45:53,319
internalized Emacs so so I use at this
 

2251
00:45:53,319 --> 00:45:55,769
internalized Emacs so so I use at this
point I stopped using IDI always can I

2252
00:45:55,769 --> 00:45:55,779
point I stopped using IDI always can I
 

2253
00:45:55,779 --> 00:45:59,249
point I stopped using IDI always can I
use VI sometimes and I use Sam when I

2254
00:45:59,249 --> 00:45:59,259
use VI sometimes and I use Sam when I
 

2255
00:45:59,259 --> 00:46:02,009
use VI sometimes and I use Sam when I
can and Sam is available on most systems

2256
00:46:02,009 --> 00:46:02,019
can and Sam is available on most systems
 

2257
00:46:02,019 --> 00:46:04,680

it was it is available you have to

it was it is available you have to
 

2259
00:46:04,690 --> 00:46:06,509
it was it is available you have to

most of the actual programming I do is C

a brief history of programming languages

2288
00:46:44,490 --> 00:46:44,500
a brief history of programming languages
 

2289
00:46:44,500 --> 00:46:47,070
a brief history of programming languages
from your perspective so I guess you

2290
00:46:47,070 --> 00:46:47,080
from your perspective so I guess you
 

2291
00:46:47,080 --> 00:46:48,750
from your perspective so I guess you
could say programming languages started

2292
00:46:48,750 --> 00:46:48,760
could say programming languages started
 

2293
00:46:48,760 --> 00:46:51,210
could say programming languages started
probably in what the late 40s or

2294
00:46:51,210 --> 00:46:51,220
probably in what the late 40s or
 

2295
00:46:51,220 --> 00:46:52,590
probably in what the late 40s or
something like that people used to

2296
00:46:52,590 --> 00:46:52,600
something like that people used to
 

2297
00:46:52,600 --> 00:46:55,020
something like that people used to
program computers by basically putting

2298
00:46:55,020 --> 00:46:55,030
program computers by basically putting
 

2299
00:46:55,030 --> 00:46:56,970
program computers by basically putting
in zeros and ones using something like

2300
00:46:56,970 --> 00:46:56,980
in zeros and ones using something like
 

2301
00:46:56,980 --> 00:47:01,980
in zeros and ones using something like
switches on a console and then or maybe

2302
00:47:01,980 --> 00:47:01,990
switches on a console and then or maybe
 

2303
00:47:01,990 --> 00:47:04,230
switches on a console and then or maybe
holes and paper tapes something like

2304
00:47:04,230 --> 00:47:04,240
holes and paper tapes something like
 

2305
00:47:04,240 --> 00:47:07,290
holes and paper tapes something like
that so extremely tedious awful whatever

2306
00:47:07,290 --> 00:47:07,300
that so extremely tedious awful whatever
 

2307
00:47:07,300 --> 00:47:09,720
that so extremely tedious awful whatever
and so I think the first programming

2308
00:47:09,720 --> 00:47:09,730
and so I think the first programming
 

2309
00:47:09,730 --> 00:47:13,770
and so I think the first programming
languages were relatively crude assembly

2310
00:47:13,770 --> 00:47:13,780
languages were relatively crude assembly
 

2311
00:47:13,780 --> 00:47:17,670
languages were relatively crude assembly
languages where people would basically

2312
00:47:17,670 --> 00:47:17,680
languages where people would basically
 

2313
00:47:17,680 --> 00:47:19,640
languages where people would basically
write a program that would convert

2314
00:47:19,640 --> 00:47:19,650
write a program that would convert
 

2315
00:47:19,650 --> 00:47:23,880
write a program that would convert
mnemonics like add a DD into whatever

2316
00:47:23,880 --> 00:47:23,890
mnemonics like add a DD into whatever
 

2317
00:47:23,890 --> 00:47:25,620
mnemonics like add a DD into whatever
the bit pattern was it corresponding to

00:47:25,620 --> 00:47:25,630
the bit pattern was it corresponding to
 

2319
00:47:25,630 --> 00:47:27,450
the bit pattern was it corresponding to
an add instruction and they'd do the

2320
00:47:27,450 --> 00:47:27,460
an add instruction and they'd do the
 

2321
00:47:27,460 --> 00:47:29,220
an add instruction and they'd do the
clerical work of figuring out where

2322
00:47:29,220 --> 00:47:29,230
clerical work of figuring out where
 

2323
00:47:29,230 --> 00:47:31,500
clerical work of figuring out where
things were so you could put a name on a

2324
00:47:31,500 --> 00:47:31,510
things were so you could put a name on a
 

2325
00:47:31,510 --> 00:47:33,480
things were so you could put a name on a
location in a program and the assembler

2326
00:47:33,480 --> 00:47:33,490
location in a program and the assembler
 

2327
00:47:33,490 --> 00:47:35,760
location in a program and the assembler
would figure out where that corresponded

2328
00:47:35,760 --> 00:47:35,770
would figure out where that corresponded
 

2329
00:47:35,770 --> 00:47:37,590
would figure out where that corresponded
to when the thing was all put together

2330
00:47:37,590 --> 00:47:37,600
to when the thing was all put together
 

2331
00:47:37,600 --> 00:47:41,780
to when the thing was all put together
and dropped into memory and they were

2332
00:47:41,780 --> 00:47:41,790
and dropped into memory and they were
 

2333
00:47:41,790 --> 00:47:44,490
and dropped into memory and they were
early on and this would be the late 40s

2334
00:47:44,490 --> 00:47:44,500
early on and this would be the late 40s
 

2335
00:47:44,500 --> 00:47:47,370
early on and this would be the late 40s
and very early 50s there were assemblers

2336
00:47:47,370 --> 00:47:47,380
and very early 50s there were assemblers
 

2337
00:47:47,380 --> 00:47:50,190
and very early 50s there were assemblers

2349
00:48:01,180 --> 00:48:02,790
language for China knew only by name but
it sounds like it was a flavor of

00:48:02,790 --> 00:48:02,800
it sounds like it was a flavor of
 

2351
00:48:02,800 --> 00:48:05,250
it sounds like it was a flavor of
assembly language sort of a little

2352
00:48:05,250 --> 00:48:05,260
assembly language sort of a little
 

2353
00:48:05,260 --> 00:48:07,440
assembly language sort of a little
higher in some ways um and a replaced on

you put in zeros and ones but you put in
 

2359
00:48:11,650 --> 00:48:12,990
you put in zeros and ones but you put in

Hardware worked very tense right yeah

2362
00:48:15,630 --> 00:48:15,640
Hardware worked very tense right yeah
 

2363
00:48:15,640 --> 00:48:18,870
Hardware worked very tense right yeah
yeah that's right backwards so assembly

2364
00:48:18,870 --> 00:48:18,880
yeah that's right backwards so assembly
 

2365
00:48:18,880 --> 00:48:21,240
yeah that's right backwards so assembly
languages learn let's call at the early

2366
00:48:21,240 --> 00:48:21,250

2367
00:48:21,250 --> 00:48:23,640
languages learn let's call at the early
1950s and so every different flavor of

00:48:23,640 --> 00:48:23,650
1950s and so every different flavor of
 

2369
00:48:23,650 --> 00:48:25,740
1950s and so every different flavor of

so the EDSAC head hits in a manchester

2372
00:48:27,780 --> 00:48:27,790
so the EDSAC head hits in a manchester
 

2373
00:48:27,790 --> 00:48:31,470
so the EDSAC head hits in a manchester
head it and the IBM whatever 70 90 or

00:48:31,470 --> 00:48:31,480
head it and the IBM whatever 70 90 or
 

2375
00:48:31,480 --> 00:48:34,290
head it and the IBM whatever 70 90 or
704 or whatever had hits and so on so

2376
00:48:34,290 --> 00:48:34,300
704 or whatever had hits and so on so
 

2377
00:48:34,300 --> 00:48:35,609
704 or whatever had hits and so on so
everybody had their own assembly like

everybody had their own assembly like
 

2379
00:48:35,619 --> 00:48:37,420
everybody had their own assembly like
when assembly languages have a

00:48:53,500 --> 00:48:53,510
machine's repertoire and so you have to
 

2395
00:48:53,510 --> 00:48:55,270
machine's repertoire and so you have to
know the Machine intimately to be able

know the Machine intimately to be able
 

2397
00:48:55,280 --> 00:48:57,309
know the Machine intimately to be able
to write programs in it and if you write

00:48:57,309 --> 00:48:57,319
to write programs in it and if you write
 

2399
00:48:57,319 --> 00:48:59,140
to write programs in it and if you write
an assembly language program for one

2400
00:48:59,140 --> 00:48:59,150
an assembly language program for one
 

2401
00:48:59,150 --> 00:49:00,579
an assembly language program for one
kind of machine and then you say jeez

and you could move up a level in writing

2412
00:49:14,079 --> 00:49:14,089
and you could move up a level in writing
 

2413
00:49:14,089 --> 00:49:16,120
and you could move up a level in writing

2449
00:49:55,579 --> 00:49:58,329
later and so all of those moved the
level up and so they were closer to what

00:49:58,329 --> 00:49:58,339
level up and so they were closer to what

2479
00:50:28,130 --> 00:50:29,620

00:50:29,620 --> 00:50:29,630
meant two things
 

2481
00:50:29,630 --> 00:50:31,030
meant two things
it meant you only had to write the

00:50:31,030 --> 00:50:31,040
it meant you only had to write the
 

2483
00:50:31,040 --> 00:50:33,579
it meant you only had to write the

2498
00:50:46,150 --> 00:50:46,160

2499
00:50:46,160 --> 00:50:48,069

it democratized and made much more

00:50:48,069 --> 00:50:48,079
it democratized and made much more
 

2501
00:50:48,079 --> 00:50:50,349
it democratized and made much more

00:50:53,170 --> 00:50:53,180
so it puts the power of programming to
 

2507
00:50:53,180 --> 00:50:54,820
so it puts the power of programming to
the hands of people like you yeah

2508
00:50:54,820 --> 00:50:54,830
the hands of people like you yeah

some time in learning a programming

2512
00:50:58,750 --> 00:50:58,760
some time in learning a programming
 

2513
00:50:58,760 --> 00:51:00,880
some time in learning a programming
language and is not then tied to a

language and is not then tied to a
 

2515
00:51:00,890 --> 00:51:04,000

00:51:04,000 --> 00:51:04,010
particular kind of computer and then in
 

2517
00:51:04,010 --> 00:51:05,560
particular kind of computer and then in
the 70s you get system programming

2518
00:51:05,560 --> 00:51:05,570
the 70s you get system programming
 

2519
00:51:05,570 --> 00:51:08,430
the 70s you get system programming
languages of which C is the survivor and

00:51:08,430 --> 00:51:08,440
languages of which C is the survivor and
 

2521
00:51:08,440 --> 00:51:11,320
languages of which C is the survivor and
what what a system programming language

2522
00:51:11,320 --> 00:51:11,330
what what a system programming language
 

2523
00:51:11,330 --> 00:51:14,260
what what a system programming language
learning programs that programming

2524
00:51:14,260 --> 00:51:14,270
learning programs that programming
 

2525
00:51:14,270 --> 00:51:16,180
learning programs that programming
languages that would take on the kinds

of things that would necessary to write
 

2529
00:51:17,630 --> 00:51:19,630
of things that would necessary to write
so-called system programs things like

2530
00:51:19,630 --> 00:51:19,640
so-called system programs things like
 

2531
00:51:19,640 --> 00:51:22,630
so-called system programs things like
text editors or assemblers or compilers

2532

text editors or assemblers or compilers
 

2533
00:51:22,640 --> 00:51:25,090

00:51:36,800 --> 00:51:39,010
processing it's a different flavor what
they're doing they're much more in touch

they're doing they're much more in touch
 

2549
00:51:39,020 --> 00:51:41,560
they're doing they're much more in touch
with the actual machine in a but in a

2551
00:51:41,570 --> 00:51:43,270
with the actual machine in a but in a
positive way that is you can talk about

00:51:43,270 --> 00:51:43,280
positive way that is you can talk about
 

2553
00:51:43,280 --> 00:51:46,210
positive way that is you can talk about
memory in a more controlled way you can

2554
00:51:46,210 --> 00:51:46,220
memory in a more controlled way you can
 

2555
00:51:46,220 --> 00:51:47,740
memory in a more controlled way you can
talk about the different data types that

2556
00:51:47,740 --> 00:51:47,750
talk about the different data types that
 

2557
00:51:47,750 --> 00:51:50,530
talk about the different data types that
the Machine supports and underway there

the Machine supports and underway there
 

2559
00:51:50,540 --> 00:51:53,890
the Machine supports and underway there
and more ways to structure and organize

2560
00:51:53,890 --> 00:51:53,900
and more ways to structure and organize
 

2561
00:51:53,900 --> 00:51:56,710
and more ways to structure and organize
data and so the system programming

2562
00:51:56,710 --> 00:51:56,720
data and so the system programming
 

2563
00:51:56,720 --> 00:51:58,480
data and so the system programming
languages there was a lot of effort in

2564
00:51:58,480 --> 00:51:58,490
languages there was a lot of effort in
 

2565
00:51:58,490 --> 00:52:01,510
languages there was a lot of effort in
that and call it the late 60s early 70s

2566
00:52:01,510 --> 00:52:01,520
that and call it the late 60s early 70s
 

2567
00:52:01,520 --> 00:52:04,480
that and call it the late 60s early 70s
C is I think the only real survivor of

00:52:04,480 --> 00:52:04,490
C is I think the only real survivor of
 

2569
00:52:04,490 --> 00:52:08,160
C is I think the only real survivor of
that and then what happens after that

2570
00:52:08,160 --> 00:52:08,170
that and then what happens after that
 

2571
00:52:08,170 --> 00:52:10,540
that and then what happens after that
you get things like object-oriented

2572
00:52:10,540 --> 00:52:10,550
you get things like object-oriented
 

2573
00:52:10,550 --> 00:52:12,940
you get things like object-oriented
programming languages because as you

2574
00:52:12,940 --> 00:52:12,950
programming languages because as you
 

2575
00:52:12,950 --> 00:52:14,950
programming languages because as you
write programs in a language like C at

2576
00:52:14,950 --> 00:52:14,960
write programs in a language like C at
 

2577
00:52:14,960 --> 00:52:16,810
write programs in a language like C at
some point scale gets to you and it's

2578
00:52:16,810 --> 00:52:16,820
some point scale gets to you and it's
 

2579
00:52:16,820 --> 00:52:18,580
some point scale gets to you and it's
too hard to keep track of the pieces and

2580
00:52:18,580 --> 00:52:18,590
too hard to keep track of the pieces and
 

2581
00:52:18,590 --> 00:52:20,950
too hard to keep track of the pieces and
there's no guardrails or training wheels

2582
00:52:20,950 --> 00:52:20,960
there's no guardrails or training wheels
 

2583
00:52:20,960 --> 00:52:22,480
there's no guardrails or training wheels
or something like that to prevent you

2584
00:52:22,480 --> 00:52:22,490
or something like that to prevent you
 

2585
00:52:22,490 --> 00:52:23,680
or something like that to prevent you
from doing bad things

2586
00:52:23,680 --> 00:52:23,690
from doing bad things
 

2587
00:52:23,690 --> 00:52:28,150
from doing bad things
so C++ comes out of that tradition it's

2588
00:52:28,150 --> 00:52:28,160
so C++ comes out of that tradition it's
 

2589
00:52:28,160 --> 00:52:29,770
so C++ comes out of that tradition it's
and then it took off from there I mean

2590
00:52:29,770 --> 00:52:29,780
and then it took off from there I mean
 

2591
00:52:29,780 --> 00:52:31,540
and then it took off from there I mean
there's also a parallel slightly

2592
00:52:31,540 --> 00:52:31,550
there's also a parallel slightly
 

2593
00:52:31,550 --> 00:52:32,860
there's also a parallel slightly
parallel track with a little bit of

2594
00:52:32,860 --> 00:52:32,870
parallel track with a little bit of
 

2595
00:52:32,870 --> 00:52:35,350
parallel track with a little bit of
functional stuff with Lisp and so on but

2596
00:52:35,350 --> 00:52:35,360
functional stuff with Lisp and so on but
 

2597
00:52:35,360 --> 00:52:37,390
functional stuff with Lisp and so on but
I guess from that point is just an

2598
00:52:37,390 --> 00:52:37,400
I guess from that point is just an
 

2599
00:52:37,400 --> 00:52:39,370
I guess from that point is just an
explosion of languages it was a Java

2600
00:52:39,370 --> 00:52:39,380
explosion of languages it was a Java
 

2601
00:52:39,380 --> 00:52:42,760

the stuff that the cool kids these days
 

2605
00:52:44,870 --> 00:52:46,930
the stuff that the cool kids these days
are doing with rust and all that they

00:52:46,930 --> 00:52:46,940
are doing with rust and all that they

00:53:16,729 --> 00:53:18,700
that in of expressiveness so you can
rewrite things in a pretty natural way

in terms of what computers could do
 

2639
00:53:31,099 --> 00:53:33,670
in terms of what computers could do
that's you know roughly four or five

don't know perhaps the environment that
it came with as well which was Unix so

2648
00:53:46,509 --> 00:53:46,519
it came with as well which was Unix so
 

2649
00:53:46,519 --> 00:53:48,130
it came with as well which was Unix so
it meant if you wrote a program it could

2650
00:53:48,130 --> 00:53:48,140
it meant if you wrote a program it could
 

2651
00:53:48,140 --> 00:53:49,989
it meant if you wrote a program it could
be used on all those computers that ran

that way it was UNIX the operating

2658
00:53:55,779 --> 00:53:55,789
that way it was UNIX the operating
 

2659
00:53:55,789 --> 00:53:57,549
that way it was UNIX the operating
system itself was portable as where all

2660
00:53:57,549 --> 00:53:57,559
system itself was portable as where all
 

2661
00:53:57,559 --> 00:53:59,650
system itself was portable as where all
the tools so it all worked together

2662
00:53:59,650 --> 00:53:59,660
the tools so it all worked together
 

2663
00:53:59,660 --> 00:54:01,630
the tools so it all worked together
again and one of these things work

2664
00:54:01,630 --> 00:54:01,640
again and one of these things work
 

2665
00:54:01,640 --> 00:54:04,269
again and one of these things work
things fit on each other in a positive

2666
00:54:04,269 --> 00:54:04,279
things fit on each other in a positive
 

2667
00:54:04,279 --> 00:54:08,410
things fit on each other in a positive
cycle what did it take to write sort of

2668
00:54:08,410 --> 00:54:08,420
cycle what did it take to write sort of
 

2669
00:54:08,420 --> 00:54:10,359
cycle what did it take to write sort of
a definitive book probably the

2670
00:54:10,359 --> 00:54:10,369
a definitive book probably the
 

2671
00:54:10,369 --> 00:54:12,009
a definitive book probably the
definitive book on all of programs like

2672
00:54:12,009 --> 00:54:12,019
definitive book on all of programs like
 

2673
00:54:12,019 --> 00:54:14,200
definitive book on all of programs like
it's more definitive to a particular

2674
00:54:14,200 --> 00:54:14,210
it's more definitive to a particular
 

2675
00:54:14,210 --> 00:54:15,489
it's more definitive to a particular
language than any other book on any

2676
00:54:15,489 --> 00:54:15,499
language than any other book on any
 

2677
00:54:15,499 --> 00:54:18,069
language than any other book on any
other language and did two really

2678
00:54:18,069 --> 00:54:18,079
other language and did two really
 

2679
00:54:18,079 --> 00:54:21,400
other language and did two really
powerful things which is popularized the

2680
00:54:21,400 --> 00:54:21,410
powerful things which is popularized the
 

2681
00:54:21,410 --> 00:54:23,319
powerful things which is popularized the
language and at least from my

2682
00:54:23,319 --> 00:54:23,329
language and at least from my
 

2683
00:54:23,329 --> 00:54:25,029
language and at least from my
perspective maybe you can correct me and

2684
00:54:25,029 --> 00:54:25,039
perspective maybe you can correct me and
 

2685
00:54:25,039 --> 00:54:29,589
perspective maybe you can correct me and
second is created a standard of how you

2686
00:54:29,589 --> 00:54:29,599
second is created a standard of how you
 

2687
00:54:29,599 --> 00:54:31,749
second is created a standard of how you
know the how this language is supposed

2688
00:54:31,749 --> 00:54:31,759
know the how this language is supposed
 

2689
00:54:31,759 --> 00:54:34,509
know the how this language is supposed
to be used and applied so what did it

2690
00:54:34,509 --> 00:54:34,519
to be used and applied so what did it
 

2691
00:54:34,519 --> 00:54:36,190
to be used and applied so what did it
take did you have those kinds of

2692
00:54:36,190 --> 00:54:36,200
take did you have those kinds of
 

2693
00:54:36,200 --> 00:54:38,079
take did you have those kinds of
ambitions in mind when we're working on

2694
00:54:38,079 --> 00:54:38,089
ambitions in mind when we're working on
 

2695
00:54:38,089 --> 00:54:41,920
ambitions in mind when we're working on
that some kind of joke no of course not

2696
00:54:41,920 --> 00:54:41,930
that some kind of joke no of course not
 

2697
00:54:41,930 --> 00:54:45,959
that some kind of joke no of course not
of the knacks it's an accident of timing

2698
00:54:45,959 --> 00:54:45,969
of the knacks it's an accident of timing
 

2699
00:54:45,969 --> 00:54:48,910
of the knacks it's an accident of timing
skill and just luck a lot of it is

2700
00:54:48,910 --> 00:54:48,920
skill and just luck a lot of it is
 

2701
00:54:48,920 --> 00:54:51,400
skill and just luck a lot of it is
clearly I timing was good

2702
00:54:51,400 --> 00:54:51,410
clearly I timing was good
 

2703
00:54:51,410 --> 00:54:53,859
clearly I timing was good
now Denison I wrote the book in 1977 I

2704
00:54:53,859 --> 00:54:53,869
now Denison I wrote the book in 1977 I
 

2705
00:54:53,869 --> 00:54:57,039
now Denison I wrote the book in 1977 I
miss ritchi yeah right and at that point

2706
00:54:57,039 --> 00:54:57,049
miss ritchi yeah right and at that point
 

2707
00:54:57,049 --> 00:54:59,259
miss ritchi yeah right and at that point
UNIX was starting to spread I don't know

2708
00:54:59,259 --> 00:54:59,269
UNIX was starting to spread I don't know
 

2709
00:54:59,269 --> 00:55:00,579
UNIX was starting to spread I don't know
how many there were but it would be

2710
00:55:00,579 --> 00:55:00,589
how many there were but it would be
 

2711
00:55:00,589 --> 00:55:02,709
how many there were but it would be
dozens to hundreds of UNIX systems um

2712
00:55:02,709 --> 00:55:02,719
dozens to hundreds of UNIX systems um
 

2713
00:55:02,719 --> 00:55:06,190
dozens to hundreds of UNIX systems um
and C was also available on other kinds

2714
00:55:06,190 --> 00:55:06,200
and C was also available on other kinds
 

2715
00:55:06,200 --> 00:55:07,479
and C was also available on other kinds
of computers that had nothing to do with

2716
00:55:07,479 --> 00:55:07,489
of computers that had nothing to do with
 

2717
00:55:07,489 --> 00:55:10,509
of computers that had nothing to do with
UNIX and so the language had some

2718
00:55:10,509 --> 00:55:10,519
UNIX and so the language had some
 

2719
00:55:10,519 --> 00:55:15,700
UNIX and so the language had some
potential and there were no other books

2720
00:55:15,700 --> 00:55:15,710
potential and there were no other books
 

2721
00:55:15,710 --> 00:55:18,190
potential and there were no other books
on C and

2722
00:55:18,190 --> 00:55:18,200
on C and
 

2723
00:55:18,200 --> 00:55:19,839
on C and
Bell Labs was really the only source

2724
00:55:19,839 --> 00:55:19,849
Bell Labs was really the only source
 

2725
00:55:19,849 --> 00:55:21,310
Bell Labs was really the only source
Ford and Dennis of course was

2726
00:55:21,310 --> 00:55:21,320
Ford and Dennis of course was
 

2727
00:55:21,320 --> 00:55:23,410
Ford and Dennis of course was
authoritative because it was his

2728
00:55:23,410 --> 00:55:23,420
authoritative because it was his
 

2729
00:55:23,420 --> 00:55:25,120
authoritative because it was his
language and he had written the

2730
00:55:25,120 --> 00:55:25,130
language and he had written the
 

2731
00:55:25,130 --> 00:55:27,550
language and he had written the
reference manual which is a marvelous

2732
00:55:27,550 --> 00:55:27,560
reference manual which is a marvelous
 

2733
00:55:27,560 --> 00:55:28,690
reference manual which is a marvelous
example of how to write a reference

2734
00:55:28,690 --> 00:55:28,700
example of how to write a reference
 

2735
00:55:28,700 --> 00:55:31,300
example of how to write a reference
manual really really very very well done

2736
00:55:31,300 --> 00:55:31,310
manual really really very very well done
 

2737
00:55:31,310 --> 00:55:33,550
manual really really very very well done
so I twisted his arm until he agreed to

2738
00:55:33,550 --> 00:55:33,560
so I twisted his arm until he agreed to
 

2739
00:55:33,560 --> 00:55:34,900
so I twisted his arm until he agreed to
write a book and then we wrote a book

2740
00:55:34,900 --> 00:55:34,910
write a book and then we wrote a book
 

2741
00:55:34,910 --> 00:55:38,620
write a book and then we wrote a book
and the virtue our advantage at least I

2742
00:55:38,620 --> 00:55:38,630
and the virtue our advantage at least I
 

2743
00:55:38,630 --> 00:55:40,569
and the virtue our advantage at least I
guess if going first is that then other

2744
00:55:40,569 --> 00:55:40,579
guess if going first is that then other
 

2745
00:55:40,579 --> 00:55:42,069
guess if going first is that then other
people have to follow you if they're

2746
00:55:42,069 --> 00:55:42,079
people have to follow you if they're
 

2747
00:55:42,079 --> 00:55:46,240
people have to follow you if they're
gonna do anything and I think it worked

2748
00:55:46,240 --> 00:55:46,250
gonna do anything and I think it worked
 

2749
00:55:46,250 --> 00:55:50,349
gonna do anything and I think it worked
well because Dennis's superb writer I

2750
00:55:50,349 --> 00:55:50,359
well because Dennis's superb writer I
 

2751
00:55:50,359 --> 00:55:52,180
well because Dennis's superb writer I
mean he really really did and that the

2752
00:55:52,180 --> 00:55:52,190
mean he really really did and that the
 

2753
00:55:52,190 --> 00:55:54,130
mean he really really did and that the
reference manual in that book is his

2754
00:55:54,130 --> 00:55:54,140
reference manual in that book is his
 

2755
00:55:54,140 --> 00:55:56,560
reference manual in that book is his
period I had nothing to do with that at

2756
00:55:56,560 --> 00:55:56,570
period I had nothing to do with that at
 

2757
00:55:56,570 --> 00:56:00,880
period I had nothing to do with that at
all so just crystal-clear prose and very

2758
00:56:00,880 --> 00:56:00,890
all so just crystal-clear prose and very
 

2759
00:56:00,890 --> 00:56:01,839
all so just crystal-clear prose and very
very well expressed

2760
00:56:01,839 --> 00:56:01,849
very well expressed
 

2761
00:56:01,849 --> 00:56:05,680
very well expressed
um and then he and I I wrote most of the

2762
00:56:05,680 --> 00:56:05,690
um and then he and I I wrote most of the
 

2763
00:56:05,690 --> 00:56:08,650
um and then he and I I wrote most of the
expository material and then he and I

2764
00:56:08,650 --> 00:56:08,660
expository material and then he and I
 

2765
00:56:08,660 --> 00:56:10,270
expository material and then he and I
sort of did the usual ping-pong game

2766
00:56:10,270 --> 00:56:10,280
sort of did the usual ping-pong game
 

2767
00:56:10,280 --> 00:56:13,599
sort of did the usual ping-pong game
back and forth hum refining it but I

2768
00:56:13,599 --> 00:56:13,609
back and forth hum refining it but I
 

2769
00:56:13,609 --> 00:56:14,920
back and forth hum refining it but I
spend a lot of time trying to find

2770
00:56:14,920 --> 00:56:14,930
spend a lot of time trying to find
 

2771
00:56:14,930 --> 00:56:16,300
spend a lot of time trying to find
examples that would sort of hang

2772
00:56:16,300 --> 00:56:16,310
examples that would sort of hang
 

2773
00:56:16,310 --> 00:56:18,099
examples that would sort of hang
together and they would tell people what

2774
00:56:18,099 --> 00:56:18,109
together and they would tell people what
 

2775
00:56:18,109 --> 00:56:19,569
together and they would tell people what
they might need to know at about the

2776
00:56:19,569 --> 00:56:19,579
they might need to know at about the
 

2777
00:56:19,579 --> 00:56:21,069
they might need to know at about the
right time that they should be thinking

2778
00:56:21,069 --> 00:56:21,079
right time that they should be thinking
 

2779
00:56:21,079 --> 00:56:24,490
right time that they should be thinking
about needing it and I'm not sure it

2780
00:56:24,490 --> 00:56:24,500
about needing it and I'm not sure it
 

2781
00:56:24,500 --> 00:56:26,470
about needing it and I'm not sure it
completely succeeded but it mostly

2782
00:56:26,470 --> 00:56:26,480
completely succeeded but it mostly
 

2783
00:56:26,480 --> 00:56:28,930
completely succeeded but it mostly
worked out fairly well what do you think

2784
00:56:28,930 --> 00:56:28,940
worked out fairly well what do you think
 

2785
00:56:28,940 --> 00:56:31,260
worked out fairly well what do you think
is the power of example I mean you're

2786
00:56:31,260 --> 00:56:31,270
is the power of example I mean you're
 

2787
00:56:31,270 --> 00:56:35,319
is the power of example I mean you're
you're the creator at least one of the

2788
00:56:35,319 --> 00:56:35,329
you're the creator at least one of the
 

2789
00:56:35,329 --> 00:56:36,940
you're the creator at least one of the
first people to do the hello world

2790
00:56:36,940 --> 00:56:36,950
first people to do the hello world
 

2791
00:56:36,950 --> 00:56:41,319
first people to do the hello world
program just like the example if aliens

2792
00:56:41,319 --> 00:56:41,329
program just like the example if aliens
 

2793
00:56:41,329 --> 00:56:43,510
program just like the example if aliens
discover our civilization hundreds of

2794
00:56:43,510 --> 00:56:43,520
discover our civilization hundreds of
 

2795
00:56:43,520 --> 00:56:45,190
discover our civilization hundreds of
years from now they'll probably hello

2796
00:56:45,190 --> 00:56:45,200
years from now they'll probably hello
 

2797
00:56:45,200 --> 00:56:47,650
years from now they'll probably hello
what other programs just like a half

2798
00:56:47,650 --> 00:56:47,660
what other programs just like a half
 

2799
00:56:47,660 --> 00:56:49,480
what other programs just like a half
broken robot communicating with them

2800
00:56:49,480 --> 00:56:49,490
broken robot communicating with them
 

2801
00:56:49,490 --> 00:56:52,150
broken robot communicating with them
with the hello world so what and that's

2802
00:56:52,150 --> 00:56:52,160
with the hello world so what and that's
 

2803
00:56:52,160 --> 00:56:54,609
with the hello world so what and that's
a representative example so what what do

2804
00:56:54,609 --> 00:56:54,619
a representative example so what what do
 

2805
00:56:54,619 --> 00:56:57,069
a representative example so what what do
you find powerful about examples but I

2806
00:56:57,069 --> 00:56:57,079
you find powerful about examples but I
 

2807
00:56:57,079 --> 00:57:00,250
you find powerful about examples but I
think a good example will tell you how

2808
00:57:00,250 --> 00:57:00,260
think a good example will tell you how
 

2809
00:57:00,260 --> 00:57:02,140
think a good example will tell you how
to do something and it will be

2810
00:57:02,140 --> 00:57:02,150
to do something and it will be
 

2811
00:57:02,150 --> 00:57:04,599
to do something and it will be
representative of you might not want to

2812
00:57:04,599 --> 00:57:04,609
representative of you might not want to
 

2813
00:57:04,609 --> 00:57:06,520
representative of you might not want to
do exactly that but you will want to do

2814
00:57:06,520 --> 00:57:06,530
do exactly that but you will want to do
 

2815
00:57:06,530 --> 00:57:08,170
do exactly that but you will want to do
something that's at least in that same

2816
00:57:08,170 --> 00:57:08,180
something that's at least in that same
 

2817
00:57:08,180 --> 00:57:11,530
something that's at least in that same
general vein and so a lot of the

2818
00:57:11,530 --> 00:57:11,540
general vein and so a lot of the
 

2819
00:57:11,540 --> 00:57:14,319
general vein and so a lot of the
examples in the C book were picked for

2820
00:57:14,319 --> 00:57:14,329
examples in the C book were picked for
 

2821
00:57:14,329 --> 00:57:15,940
examples in the C book were picked for
these very very simple straightforward

2822
00:57:15,940 --> 00:57:15,950
these very very simple straightforward
 

2823
00:57:15,950 --> 00:57:17,950
these very very simple straightforward
text processing problems that were

2824
00:57:17,950 --> 00:57:17,960
text processing problems that were
 

2825
00:57:17,960 --> 00:57:22,059
text processing problems that were
typical of UNIX I want to read input and

2826
00:57:22,059 --> 00:57:22,069
typical of UNIX I want to read input and
 

2827
00:57:22,069 --> 00:57:24,640
typical of UNIX I want to read input and
write it again there's a copy command I

2828
00:57:24,640 --> 00:57:24,650
write it again there's a copy command I
 

2829
00:57:24,650 --> 00:57:26,650
write it again there's a copy command I
want to read input and do something to

2830
00:57:26,650 --> 00:57:26,660
want to read input and do something to
 

2831
00:57:26,660 --> 00:57:28,480
want to read input and do something to
it and write it out again there's a grep

2832
00:57:28,480 --> 00:57:28,490
it and write it out again there's a grep
 

2833
00:57:28,490 --> 00:57:32,070
it and write it out again there's a grep
and so that kind of fine things that are

2834
00:57:32,070 --> 00:57:32,080
and so that kind of fine things that are
 

2835
00:57:32,080 --> 00:57:34,420
and so that kind of fine things that are
representative of what people want to do

2836
00:57:34,420 --> 00:57:34,430
representative of what people want to do
 

2837
00:57:34,430 --> 00:57:38,109
representative of what people want to do
and spell those out so that they can

2838
00:57:38,109 --> 00:57:38,119
and spell those out so that they can
 

2839
00:57:38,119 --> 00:57:41,320
and spell those out so that they can
then take those and see the the core

2840
00:57:41,320 --> 00:57:41,330
then take those and see the the core
 

2841
00:57:41,330 --> 00:57:45,520
then take those and see the the core
parts and modify them to their taste and

2842
00:57:45,520 --> 00:57:45,530
parts and modify them to their taste and
 

2843
00:57:45,530 --> 00:57:48,490
parts and modify them to their taste and
I think that a lot of programming books

2844
00:57:48,490 --> 00:57:48,500
I think that a lot of programming books
 

2845
00:57:48,500 --> 00:57:51,190
I think that a lot of programming books
that I don't look at programming books a

2846
00:57:51,190 --> 00:57:51,200
that I don't look at programming books a
 

2847
00:57:51,200 --> 00:57:52,570
that I don't look at programming books a
tremendous amount these days but when I

2848
00:57:52,570 --> 00:57:52,580
tremendous amount these days but when I
 

2849
00:57:52,580 --> 00:57:54,760
tremendous amount these days but when I
do a lot of don't do that they don't

2850
00:57:54,760 --> 00:57:54,770
do a lot of don't do that they don't
 

2851
00:57:54,770 --> 00:57:57,520
do a lot of don't do that they don't
give you examples that are both

2852
00:57:57,520 --> 00:57:57,530
give you examples that are both
 

2853
00:57:57,530 --> 00:58:00,609
give you examples that are both
realistic and something you might want

2854
00:58:00,609 --> 00:58:00,619
realistic and something you might want
 

2855
00:58:00,619 --> 00:58:03,430
realistic and something you might want
to do some of them are pure syntax

2856
00:58:03,430 --> 00:58:03,440
to do some of them are pure syntax
 

2857
00:58:03,440 --> 00:58:05,470
to do some of them are pure syntax
here's how you add three numbers well

2858
00:58:05,470 --> 00:58:05,480
here's how you add three numbers well
 

2859
00:58:05,480 --> 00:58:07,450
here's how you add three numbers well
come on I could figure that I would tell

2860
00:58:07,450 --> 00:58:07,460
come on I could figure that I would tell
 

2861
00:58:07,460 --> 00:58:09,130
come on I could figure that I would tell
me how I would get those three numbers

2862
00:58:09,130 --> 00:58:09,140
me how I would get those three numbers
 

2863
00:58:09,140 --> 00:58:11,200
me how I would get those three numbers
into the computer and how he would do

2864
00:58:11,200 --> 00:58:11,210
into the computer and how he would do
 

2865
00:58:11,210 --> 00:58:13,030
into the computer and how he would do
something useful with them and then how

2866
00:58:13,030 --> 00:58:13,040
something useful with them and then how
 

2867
00:58:13,040 --> 00:58:14,470
something useful with them and then how
I put them back out again neatly

2868
00:58:14,470 --> 00:58:14,480
I put them back out again neatly
 

2869
00:58:14,480 --> 00:58:16,540
I put them back out again neatly
formatted and especially if you follow

2870
00:58:16,540 --> 00:58:16,550
formatted and especially if you follow
 

2871
00:58:16,550 --> 00:58:17,890
formatted and especially if you follow
that example there is something magical

2872
00:58:17,890 --> 00:58:17,900
that example there is something magical
 

2873
00:58:17,900 --> 00:58:20,470
that example there is something magical
of doing something that feels useful

2874
00:58:20,470 --> 00:58:20,480
of doing something that feels useful
 

2875
00:58:20,480 --> 00:58:23,410
of doing something that feels useful
yeah right and I think it's the attempt

2876
00:58:23,410 --> 00:58:23,420
yeah right and I think it's the attempt
 

2877
00:58:23,420 --> 00:58:26,680
yeah right and I think it's the attempt
and it's absolutely not perfect but the

2878
00:58:26,680 --> 00:58:26,690
and it's absolutely not perfect but the
 

2879
00:58:26,690 --> 00:58:28,330
and it's absolutely not perfect but the
attempt in all cases was to get

2880
00:58:28,330 --> 00:58:28,340
attempt in all cases was to get
 

2881
00:58:28,340 --> 00:58:30,430
attempt in all cases was to get
something that was going to be either

2882
00:58:30,430 --> 00:58:30,440
something that was going to be either
 

2883
00:58:30,440 --> 00:58:33,280
something that was going to be either
directly useful or would be very

2884
00:58:33,280 --> 00:58:33,290
directly useful or would be very
 

2885
00:58:33,290 --> 00:58:35,710
directly useful or would be very
representative of useful things that a

2886
00:58:35,710 --> 00:58:35,720
representative of useful things that a
 

2887
00:58:35,720 --> 00:58:38,290
representative of useful things that a
programmer might want to do but within

2888
00:58:38,290 --> 00:58:38,300
programmer might want to do but within
 

2889
00:58:38,300 --> 00:58:40,540
programmer might want to do but within
that vein of fundamentally text

2890
00:58:40,540 --> 00:58:40,550
that vein of fundamentally text
 

2891
00:58:40,550 --> 00:58:42,490
that vein of fundamentally text
processing reading text doing something

2892
00:58:42,490 --> 00:58:42,500
processing reading text doing something
 

2893
00:58:42,500 --> 00:58:45,370
processing reading text doing something
writing text so you've also written a

2894
00:58:45,370 --> 00:58:45,380
writing text so you've also written a
 

2895
00:58:45,380 --> 00:58:49,270
writing text so you've also written a
book on go language I'd have to admit so

2896
00:58:49,270 --> 00:58:49,280
book on go language I'd have to admit so
 

2897
00:58:49,280 --> 00:58:51,880
book on go language I'd have to admit so
I worked at Google for a while and I've

2898
00:58:51,880 --> 00:58:51,890
I worked at Google for a while and I've
 

2899
00:58:51,890 --> 00:58:54,430
I worked at Google for a while and I've
never used go not you miss something

2900
00:58:54,430 --> 00:58:54,440
never used go not you miss something
 

2901
00:58:54,440 --> 00:58:56,079
never used go not you miss something
well I know I missed something for sure

2902
00:58:56,079 --> 00:58:56,089
well I know I missed something for sure
 

2903
00:58:56,089 --> 00:58:58,270
well I know I missed something for sure
I mean yeah so go and rust the two

2904
00:58:58,270 --> 00:58:58,280
I mean yeah so go and rust the two
 

2905
00:58:58,280 --> 00:59:02,130
I mean yeah so go and rust the two
languages that I hear very

2906
00:59:02,130 --> 00:59:02,140
languages that I hear very
 

2907
00:59:02,140 --> 00:59:05,170
languages that I hear very
spoken very highly of night which I

2908
00:59:05,170 --> 00:59:05,180
spoken very highly of night which I
 

2909
00:59:05,180 --> 00:59:06,609
spoken very highly of night which I
would like to try well there's a lot of

2910
00:59:06,609 --> 00:59:06,619
would like to try well there's a lot of
 

2911
00:59:06,619 --> 00:59:08,680
would like to try well there's a lot of
them there's Julia there's there's all

2912
00:59:08,680 --> 00:59:08,690
them there's Julia there's there's all
 

2913
00:59:08,690 --> 00:59:11,230
them there's Julia there's there's all
these incredible modern languages but if

2914
00:59:11,230 --> 00:59:11,240
these incredible modern languages but if
 

2915
00:59:11,240 --> 00:59:14,170
these incredible modern languages but if
you can comment before or maybe comments

2916
00:59:14,170 --> 00:59:14,180
you can comment before or maybe comments
 

2917
00:59:14,180 --> 00:59:17,170
you can comment before or maybe comments
on what do you find where does go stood

2918
00:59:17,170 --> 00:59:17,180
on what do you find where does go stood
 

2919
00:59:17,180 --> 00:59:19,510
on what do you find where does go stood
in this broad spectrum of languages and

2920
00:59:19,510 --> 00:59:19,520
in this broad spectrum of languages and
 

2921
00:59:19,520 --> 00:59:22,780
in this broad spectrum of languages and
also how do you yourself feel about this

2922
00:59:22,780 --> 00:59:22,790
also how do you yourself feel about this
 

2923
00:59:22,790 --> 00:59:25,900
also how do you yourself feel about this
wide range of powerful interesting

2924
00:59:25,900 --> 00:59:25,910
wide range of powerful interesting
 

2925
00:59:25,910 --> 00:59:28,810
wide range of powerful interesting
languages that you may never even get to

2926
00:59:28,810 --> 00:59:28,820
languages that you may never even get to
 

2927
00:59:28,820 --> 00:59:33,040
languages that you may never even get to
try to explore of time so I think so go

2928
00:59:33,040 --> 00:59:33,050
try to explore of time so I think so go
 

2929
00:59:33,050 --> 00:59:36,700
try to explore of time so I think so go
um go first comes from that same Bell

2930
00:59:36,700 --> 00:59:36,710
um go first comes from that same Bell
 

2931
00:59:36,710 --> 00:59:39,099
um go first comes from that same Bell
Labs tradition in part not exclusively

2932
00:59:39,099 --> 00:59:39,109
Labs tradition in part not exclusively
 

2933
00:59:39,109 --> 00:59:41,079
Labs tradition in part not exclusively
but two of the three creators Ken

2934
00:59:41,079 --> 00:59:41,089
but two of the three creators Ken
 

2935
00:59:41,089 --> 00:59:43,240
but two of the three creators Ken
Thompson and Rob Michael literally the

2936
00:59:43,240 --> 00:59:43,250
Thompson and Rob Michael literally the
 

2937
00:59:43,250 --> 00:59:45,460
Thompson and Rob Michael literally the
people yeah the people

2938
00:59:45,460 --> 00:59:45,470
people yeah the people
 

2939
00:59:45,470 --> 00:59:47,880
people yeah the people
and then with this very very useful

2940
00:59:47,880 --> 00:59:47,890
and then with this very very useful
 

2941
00:59:47,890 --> 00:59:50,890
and then with this very very useful
influence from the European School in

2942
00:59:50,890 --> 00:59:50,900
influence from the European School in
 

2943
00:59:50,900 --> 00:59:53,500
influence from the European School in
particular the club spirit influence of

2944
00:59:53,500 --> 00:59:53,510
particular the club spirit influence of
 

2945
00:59:53,510 --> 00:59:56,320
particular the club spirit influence of
through Robert Griesemer it was I guess

2946
00:59:56,320 --> 00:59:56,330
through Robert Griesemer it was I guess
 

2947
00:59:56,330 --> 01:00:00,150
through Robert Griesemer it was I guess
a second generation down student at ETH

2948
01:00:00,150 --> 01:00:00,160
a second generation down student at ETH
 

2949
01:00:00,160 --> 01:00:02,380
a second generation down student at ETH
and so that's an interesting combination

2950
01:00:02,380 --> 01:00:02,390
and so that's an interesting combination
 

2951
01:00:02,390 --> 01:00:05,800
and so that's an interesting combination
of things and so some ways go captures

2952
01:00:05,800 --> 01:00:05,810
of things and so some ways go captures
 

2953
01:00:05,810 --> 01:00:09,250
of things and so some ways go captures
the good parts of see it looks sort of

2954
01:00:09,250 --> 01:00:09,260
the good parts of see it looks sort of
 

2955
01:00:09,260 --> 01:00:11,080
the good parts of see it looks sort of
like see it's sometimes characterized to

2956
01:00:11,080 --> 01:00:11,090
like see it's sometimes characterized to
 

2957
01:00:11,090 --> 01:00:14,830
like see it's sometimes characterized to
see for the 21st century on the surface

2958
01:00:14,830 --> 01:00:14,840
see for the 21st century on the surface
 

2959
01:00:14,840 --> 01:00:17,770
see for the 21st century on the surface
it looks very very much like see but at

2960
01:00:17,770 --> 01:00:17,780
it looks very very much like see but at
 

2961
01:00:17,780 --> 01:00:19,240
it looks very very much like see but at
the same time it has some interesting

2962
01:00:19,240 --> 01:00:19,250
the same time it has some interesting
 

2963
01:00:19,250 --> 01:00:22,420
the same time it has some interesting
data structuring capabilities and then I

2964
01:00:22,420 --> 01:00:22,430
data structuring capabilities and then I
 

2965
01:00:22,430 --> 01:00:25,440
data structuring capabilities and then I
think the part that I would say is

2966
01:00:25,440 --> 01:00:25,450
think the part that I would say is
 

2967
01:00:25,450 --> 01:00:28,240
think the part that I would say is

routines are to my mind a very natural

2986
01:00:55,720 --> 01:00:55,730
routines are to my mind a very natural
 

2987
01:00:55,730 --> 01:00:59,200
routines are to my mind a very natural
way to talk about parallel computation

2988
01:00:59,200 --> 01:00:59,210
way to talk about parallel computation
 

2989
01:00:59,210 --> 01:01:01,240
way to talk about parallel computation
and in the few experiments I've done

2990
01:01:01,240 --> 01:01:01,250
and in the few experiments I've done
 

2991
01:01:01,250 --> 01:01:02,950
and in the few experiments I've done
with them they're easy to write and

2992
01:01:02,950 --> 01:01:02,960
with them they're easy to write and
 

2993
01:01:02,960 --> 01:01:05,530
with them they're easy to write and
typically it's going to work and very

2994
01:01:05,530 --> 01:01:05,540
typically it's going to work and very
 

2995
01:01:05,540 --> 01:01:08,140
typically it's going to work and very
efficient as well so I think that's one

2996
01:01:08,140 --> 01:01:08,150
efficient as well so I think that's one
 

2997
01:01:08,150 --> 01:01:10,300
efficient as well so I think that's one
place where it go stands out at that

2998
01:01:10,300 --> 01:01:10,310
place where it go stands out at that
 

2999
01:01:10,310 --> 01:01:13,540
place where it go stands out at that
model of parallel computation it's very

3000
01:01:13,540 --> 01:01:13,550
model of parallel computation it's very
 

3001
01:01:13,550 --> 01:01:16,900
model of parallel computation it's very
very easy and nice just to comment on

3002
01:01:16,900 --> 01:01:16,910
very easy and nice just to comment on
 

3003
01:01:16,910 --> 01:01:20,050
very easy and nice just to comment on
that do you think c4 saw or the early

01:01:20,050 --> 01:01:20,060
that do you think c4 saw or the early

massively parallel computation I would

3008
01:01:26,290 --> 01:01:26,300
massively parallel computation I would
 

3009
01:01:26,300 --> 01:01:28,480
massively parallel computation I would
guess not really I mean maybe it was

3010
01:01:28,480 --> 01:01:28,490
guess not really I mean maybe it was
 

3011
01:01:28,490 --> 01:01:31,030
guess not really I mean maybe it was
seen but not at the level where it was

3012
01:01:31,030 --> 01:01:31,040
seen but not at the level where it was
 

3013
01:01:31,040 --> 01:01:33,630
seen but not at the level where it was
something you had to do anything about

3014
01:01:33,630 --> 01:01:33,640
something you had to do anything about
 

3015
01:01:33,640 --> 01:01:37,210
something you had to do anything about
for a long time processors got faster

3016
01:01:37,210 --> 01:01:37,220
for a long time processors got faster
 

3017
01:01:37,220 --> 01:01:40,089
for a long time processors got faster
and then processors stopped getting

3018
01:01:40,089 --> 01:01:40,099
and then processors stopped getting
 

3019
01:01:40,099 --> 01:01:42,970
and then processors stopped getting
faster because of things like power

3020
01:01:42,970 --> 01:01:42,980
faster because of things like power
 

3021
01:01:42,980 --> 01:01:46,630
faster because of things like power
consumption and heat generation and so

3022
01:01:46,630 --> 01:01:46,640
consumption and heat generation and so
 

3023
01:01:46,640 --> 01:01:49,030
consumption and heat generation and so
what happened instead was that instead

3024
01:01:49,030 --> 01:01:49,040
what happened instead was that instead
 

3025
01:01:49,040 --> 01:01:50,680
what happened instead was that instead
of processors getting faster there

3026
01:01:50,680 --> 01:01:50,690
of processors getting faster there
 

3027
01:01:50,690 --> 01:01:52,810
of processors getting faster there
started to be more of them and that's

3028
01:01:52,810 --> 01:01:52,820
started to be more of them and that's
 

3029
01:01:52,820 --> 01:01:55,120
started to be more of them and that's
where that parallel thread stuff comes

3030
01:01:55,120 --> 01:01:55,130
where that parallel thread stuff comes
 

3031
01:01:55,130 --> 01:01:59,140
where that parallel thread stuff comes
in so if you can comment on the

3032
01:01:59,140 --> 01:01:59,150
in so if you can comment on the
 

3033
01:01:59,150 --> 01:02:02,020
in so if you can comment on the
the other languages is it break your

3034
01:02:02,020 --> 01:02:02,030
the other languages is it break your
 

3035
01:02:02,030 --> 01:02:03,550
the other languages is it break your
heart that you'll never get to explore

3036
01:02:03,550 --> 01:02:03,560
heart that you'll never get to explore
 

3037
01:02:03,560 --> 01:02:05,410
heart that you'll never get to explore
them of course how do you feel a lot of

3038
01:02:05,410 --> 01:02:05,420
them of course how do you feel a lot of
 

3039
01:02:05,420 --> 01:02:08,410
them of course how do you feel a lot of
the full variety it's not break my heart

3040
01:02:08,410 --> 01:02:08,420
the full variety it's not break my heart
 

3041
01:02:08,420 --> 01:02:11,500
the full variety it's not break my heart
but but I would love to be able to try

3042
01:02:11,500 --> 01:02:11,510
but but I would love to be able to try
 

3043
01:02:11,510 --> 01:02:13,660
but but I would love to be able to try
more of these languages the closest I've

3044
01:02:13,660 --> 01:02:13,670
more of these languages the closest I've
 

3045
01:02:13,670 --> 01:02:15,700
more of these languages the closest I've
come is in class that I often teach in

3046
01:02:15,700 --> 01:02:15,710
come is in class that I often teach in
 

3047
01:02:15,710 --> 01:02:17,830
come is in class that I often teach in
the spring here it's a programming class

3048
01:02:17,830 --> 01:02:17,840
the spring here it's a programming class
 

3049
01:02:17,840 --> 01:02:22,720
the spring here it's a programming class
and I often give I have one sort of

3050
01:02:22,720 --> 01:02:22,730
and I often give I have one sort of
 

3051
01:02:22,730 --> 01:02:25,120
and I often give I have one sort of
small example that I will write in as

3052
01:02:25,120 --> 01:02:25,130
small example that I will write in as
 

3053
01:02:25,130 --> 01:02:27,430
small example that I will write in as
many languages as I possibly can I've

3054
01:02:27,430 --> 01:02:27,440
many languages as I possibly can I've
 

3055
01:02:27,440 --> 01:02:29,710
many languages as I possibly can I've
got it in 20 on languages at this point

3056
01:02:29,710 --> 01:02:29,720
got it in 20 on languages at this point
 

3057
01:02:29,720 --> 01:02:33,370
got it in 20 on languages at this point
and and that's so I do a minimal

3058
01:02:33,370 --> 01:02:33,380
and and that's so I do a minimal
 

3059
01:02:33,380 --> 01:02:35,710
and and that's so I do a minimal
experiment with on language just to say

3060
01:02:35,710 --> 01:02:35,720
experiment with on language just to say
 

3061
01:02:35,720 --> 01:02:37,570
experiment with on language just to say
okay I have this trivial task which I

3062
01:02:37,570 --> 01:02:37,580
okay I have this trivial task which I
 

3063
01:02:37,580 --> 01:02:39,430
okay I have this trivial task which I
understand the task and it should it

3064
01:02:39,430 --> 01:02:39,440
understand the task and it should it
 

3065
01:02:39,440 --> 01:02:42,370
understand the task and it should it
takes 15 lines in awk and not much more

3066
01:02:42,370 --> 01:02:42,380
takes 15 lines in awk and not much more
 

3067
01:02:42,380 --> 01:02:44,860
takes 15 lines in awk and not much more
in a variety of other languages so how

3068
01:02:44,860 --> 01:02:44,870
in a variety of other languages so how
 

3069
01:02:44,870 --> 01:02:46,780
in a variety of other languages so how
big is it how fast does it run and what

3070
01:02:46,780 --> 01:02:46,790
big is it how fast does it run and what
 

3071
01:02:46,790 --> 01:02:49,480
big is it how fast does it run and what
pain did I go through to learn how to do

3072
01:02:49,480 --> 01:02:49,490
pain did I go through to learn how to do
 

3073
01:02:49,490 --> 01:02:55,390
pain did I go through to learn how to do
it and that's a it's like an Akita right

3074
01:02:55,390 --> 01:02:55,400
it and that's a it's like an Akita right
 

3075
01:02:55,400 --> 01:02:58,870
it and that's a it's like an Akita right
it's a very very very narrowly like that

3076
01:02:58,870 --> 01:02:58,880
it's a very very very narrowly like that
 

3077
01:02:58,880 --> 01:03:01,810
it's a very very very narrowly like that
so yeah but still it's a little sample

3078
01:03:01,810 --> 01:03:01,820
so yeah but still it's a little sample
 

3079
01:03:01,820 --> 01:03:03,400
so yeah but still it's a little sample
because you get to I think the hardest

3080
01:03:03,400 --> 01:03:03,410
because you get to I think the hardest
 

3081
01:03:03,410 --> 01:03:05,110
because you get to I think the hardest
step of the programming language is

3082
01:03:05,110 --> 01:03:05,120
step of the programming language is
 

3083
01:03:05,120 --> 01:03:07,450
step of the programming language is
probably the first step right so there

3084
01:03:07,450 --> 01:03:07,460
probably the first step right so there
 

3085
01:03:07,460 --> 01:03:09,220
probably the first step right so there
you're taking the first step yeah and

3086
01:03:09,220 --> 01:03:09,230
you're taking the first step yeah and
 

3087
01:03:09,230 --> 01:03:12,820
you're taking the first step yeah and
from my experience um with some

3088
01:03:12,820 --> 01:03:12,830
from my experience um with some
 

3089
01:03:12,830 --> 01:03:14,140
from my experience um with some
languages is very positive

3090
01:03:14,140 --> 01:03:14,150
languages is very positive
 

3091
01:03:14,150 --> 01:03:16,420
languages is very positive
like Lua a scripting language I'd never

3092
01:03:16,420 --> 01:03:16,430
like Lua a scripting language I'd never
 

3093
01:03:16,430 --> 01:03:19,450
like Lua a scripting language I'd never
used and I took my Britain little

3094
01:03:19,450 --> 01:03:19,460
used and I took my Britain little
 

3095
01:03:19,460 --> 01:03:20,950
used and I took my Britain little
program the program is a trivial

3096
01:03:20,950 --> 01:03:20,960

formatter it just takes in lines of text

3098
01:03:23,200 --> 01:03:23,210
formatter it just takes in lines of text
 

3099
01:03:23,210 --> 01:03:25,360
formatter it just takes in lines of text
of varying lengths and it puts them out

3100
01:03:25,360 --> 01:03:25,370
of varying lengths and it puts them out
 

3101
01:03:25,370 --> 01:03:27,820

3103
01:03:27,830 --> 01:03:29,410
in lines that have no more than 60
characters on each line so think it was

3104
01:03:29,410 --> 01:03:29,420
characters on each line so think it was
 

3105
01:03:29,420 --> 01:03:32,110
characters on each line so think it was
just kind of the flow of process in a

01:03:32,110 --> 01:03:32,120
just kind of the flow of process in a
 

3107
01:03:32,120 --> 01:03:35,440
just kind of the flow of process in a

program and um in Lua I downloaded Lua

3110
01:03:39,190 --> 01:03:39,200
program and um in Lua I downloaded Lua
 

3111
01:03:39,200 --> 01:03:40,660

01:03:45,160 --> 01:03:45,170
going with online documentation I did

the same thing in Scala which you can

01:03:46,630 --> 01:03:46,640
the same thing in Scala which you can
 

3119
01:03:46,640 --> 01:03:49,360
the same thing in Scala which you can
think of as a flavor of Java equally

trivial I did it in Haskell it took me
several weeks but it did run like a

several weeks but it did run like a

it was just a little unfamiliar to me

01:04:13,700 --> 01:04:13,710
it was just a little unfamiliar to me
 

3137
01:04:13,710 --> 01:04:16,100
it was just a little unfamiliar to me
and the problem I had with rust and it's

documentation on rust now this was

3144
01:04:21,920 --> 01:04:21,930
documentation on rust now this was
 

3145
01:04:21,930 --> 01:04:23,360
documentation on rust now this was
several years ago and I'm sure things

3146
01:04:23,360 --> 01:04:23,370
several years ago and I'm sure things
 

3147
01:04:23,370 --> 01:04:24,830
several years ago and I'm sure things
have stabilized but at the time

01:04:24,830 --> 01:04:24,840
have stabilized but at the time

everything in the rust world seemed to

01:04:26,750 --> 01:04:26,760
everything in the rust world seemed to
 

3151
01:04:26,760 --> 01:04:28,400
everything in the rust world seemed to
be changing rapidly and so you would

3152
01:04:28,400 --> 01:04:28,410
be changing rapidly and so you would
 

3153
01:04:28,410 --> 01:04:29,990
be changing rapidly and so you would
find what looked like a working example

3154
01:04:29,990 --> 01:04:30,000
find what looked like a working example
 

3155
01:04:30,000 --> 01:04:31,400
find what looked like a working example
and it wouldn't work

3156
01:04:31,400 --> 01:04:31,410
and it wouldn't work
 

3157
01:04:31,410 --> 01:04:33,110
and it wouldn't work
with the version of the language that I

3158
01:04:33,110 --> 01:04:33,120
with the version of the language that I

01:04:33,120 --> 01:04:35,840

have rust is a language I would like to

01:04:38,900 --> 01:04:38,910
have rust is a language I would like to
 

3163
01:04:38,910 --> 01:04:41,480
have rust is a language I would like to
get back to but probably won't I think

3164
01:04:41,480 --> 01:04:41,490
get back to but probably won't I think
 

3165
01:04:41,490 --> 01:04:42,620
get back to but probably won't I think
one of the issues you have to have

one of the issues you have to have

one of the issues you have to have
something you want to do if you don't

01:04:58,730 --> 01:04:58,740
going to happen so what do you think

01:04:58,740 --> 01:05:01,820
going to happen so what do you think
about another language of JavaScript

3182
01:05:01,820 --> 01:05:01,830
about another language of JavaScript
 

3183
01:05:01,830 --> 01:05:05,810
about another language of JavaScript
that's this well let me just sort of

3184
01:05:05,810 --> 01:05:05,820
that's this well let me just sort of
 

3185
01:05:05,820 --> 01:05:07,280
that's this well let me just sort of
comment on what I said when I was

3186
01:05:07,280 --> 01:05:07,290
comment on what I said when I was
 

3187
01:05:07,290 --> 01:05:10,180
comment on what I said when I was
brought up sort of JavaScript pasina's

3188
01:05:10,180 --> 01:05:10,190
brought up sort of JavaScript pasina's
 

3189
01:05:10,190 --> 01:05:13,990
brought up sort of JavaScript pasina's
the probably like the ugliest language

3190
01:05:13,990 --> 01:05:14,000
the probably like the ugliest language
 

3191
01:05:14,000 --> 01:05:17,180
the probably like the ugliest language
possible and yet it's quite arguably

3192
01:05:17,180 --> 01:05:17,190
possible and yet it's quite arguably
 

3193
01:05:17,190 --> 01:05:19,550
possible and yet it's quite arguably
quite possibly taking over not just the

3194
01:05:19,550 --> 01:05:19,560
quite possibly taking over not just the
 

3195
01:05:19,560 --> 01:05:21,770
quite possibly taking over not just the
fun in the back end of the internet but

3196
01:05:21,770 --> 01:05:21,780
fun in the back end of the internet but
 

3197
01:05:21,780 --> 01:05:23,300
fun in the back end of the internet but
possibly in the future taking over

3198
01:05:23,300 --> 01:05:23,310
possibly in the future taking over
 

3199
01:05:23,310 --> 01:05:25,400
possibly in the future taking over
everything because they've now learned

3200
01:05:25,400 --> 01:05:25,410
everything because they've now learned
 

3201
01:05:25,410 --> 01:05:28,250
everything because they've now learned
to make it very efficient yeah so what

3202
01:05:28,250 --> 01:05:28,260
to make it very efficient yeah so what
 

3203
01:05:28,260 --> 01:05:30,140
to make it very efficient yeah so what
do you think about this yeah well I

3204
01:05:30,140 --> 01:05:30,150
do you think about this yeah well I
 

3205
01:05:30,150 --> 01:05:31,850
do you think about this yeah well I
think you've captured it in a lot of

3206
01:05:31,850 --> 01:05:31,860
think you've captured it in a lot of
 

3207
01:05:31,860 --> 01:05:33,470
think you've captured it in a lot of
ways when it first came out javascript

3208
01:05:33,470 --> 01:05:33,480
ways when it first came out javascript
 

3209
01:05:33,480 --> 01:05:35,780
ways when it first came out javascript
was deemed to be fairly irregular in an

3210
01:05:35,780 --> 01:05:35,790
was deemed to be fairly irregular in an
 

3211
01:05:35,790 --> 01:05:37,160
was deemed to be fairly irregular in an
ugly language and certainly in the

3212
01:05:37,160 --> 01:05:37,170
ugly language and certainly in the
 

3213
01:05:37,170 --> 01:05:38,660
ugly language and certainly in the
academy if you said you were working on

3214
01:05:38,660 --> 01:05:38,670
academy if you said you were working on
 

3215
01:05:38,670 --> 01:05:40,550
academy if you said you were working on
javascript people would ridicule you it

3216
01:05:40,550 --> 01:05:40,560
javascript people would ridicule you it
 

3217
01:05:40,560 --> 01:05:42,620
javascript people would ridicule you it
was just not fit for academics to work

3218
01:05:42,620 --> 01:05:42,630
was just not fit for academics to work
 

3219
01:05:42,630 --> 01:05:45,500
was just not fit for academics to work
on I think a lot of that has evolved the

3220
01:05:45,500 --> 01:05:45,510
on I think a lot of that has evolved the
 

3221
01:05:45,510 --> 01:05:47,890
on I think a lot of that has evolved the
language itself has evolved and

3222
01:05:47,890 --> 01:05:47,900
language itself has evolved and
 

3223
01:05:47,900 --> 01:05:50,570
language itself has evolved and
certainly the technology of compiling it

3224
01:05:50,570 --> 01:05:50,580
certainly the technology of compiling it
 

3225
01:05:50,580 --> 01:05:53,600
certainly the technology of compiling it
is fantastically better than it was and

3226
01:05:53,600 --> 01:05:53,610
is fantastically better than it was and
 

3227
01:05:53,610 --> 01:05:56,360
is fantastically better than it was and
so in that sense it's a absolutely a

3228
01:05:56,360 --> 01:05:56,370
so in that sense it's a absolutely a
 

3229
01:05:56,370 --> 01:05:59,150
so in that sense it's a absolutely a
viable solution upon backends as well

3230
01:05:59,150 --> 01:05:59,160
viable solution upon backends as well
 

3231
01:05:59,160 --> 01:06:02,300
viable solution upon backends as well
it's the front-end used well I think

3232
01:06:02,300 --> 01:06:02,310
it's the front-end used well I think
 

3233
01:06:02,310 --> 01:06:03,830
it's the front-end used well I think
it's a pretty good language I've written

3234
01:06:03,830 --> 01:06:03,840
it's a pretty good language I've written
 

3235
01:06:03,840 --> 01:06:07,160
it's a pretty good language I've written
a modest amount of it and I've played

3236
01:06:07,160 --> 01:06:07,170
a modest amount of it and I've played
 

3237
01:06:07,170 --> 01:06:09,410
a modest amount of it and I've played
with JavaScript translators and things

3238
01:06:09,410 --> 01:06:09,420
with JavaScript translators and things
 

3239
01:06:09,420 --> 01:06:12,410
with JavaScript translators and things
like that I'm not a real expert and it's

3240
01:06:12,410 --> 01:06:12,420
like that I'm not a real expert and it's
 

3241
01:06:12,420 --> 01:06:14,210
like that I'm not a real expert and it's
hard to keep up even there with the new

3242
01:06:14,210 --> 01:06:14,220
hard to keep up even there with the new
 

3243
01:06:14,220 --> 01:06:18,470
hard to keep up even there with the new
things that come along with it um so I

3244
01:06:18,470 --> 01:06:18,480
things that come along with it um so I
 

3245
01:06:18,480 --> 01:06:20,390
things that come along with it um so I
don't know whether it will ever take

3246
01:06:20,390 --> 01:06:20,400
don't know whether it will ever take
 

3247
01:06:20,400 --> 01:06:23,950
don't know whether it will ever take
over the world I think not but it it's

3248
01:06:23,950 --> 01:06:23,960
over the world I think not but it it's
 

3249
01:06:23,960 --> 01:06:25,960
over the world I think not but it it's
certainly an important

3250
01:06:25,960 --> 01:06:25,970
certainly an important
 

3251
01:06:25,970 --> 01:06:28,450
certainly an important
language and worth knowing more about

3252
01:06:28,450 --> 01:06:28,460
language and worth knowing more about

don't know closures and just on and on

3432
01:10:03,310 --> 01:10:03,320
don't know closures and just on and on
 

3433
01:10:03,320 --> 01:10:05,830
don't know closures and just on and on
and on lambdas interesting ideas that

3434
01:10:05,830 --> 01:10:05,840
and on lambdas interesting ideas that
 

3435
01:10:05,840 --> 01:10:08,680
and on lambdas interesting ideas that
showed up first in let's call it broadly

3436
01:10:08,680 --> 01:10:08,690
showed up first in let's call it broadly
 

3437
01:10:08,690 --> 01:10:10,570
showed up first in let's call it broadly
the functional programming community and

3438
01:10:10,570 --> 01:10:10,580
the functional programming community and
 

3439
01:10:10,580 --> 01:10:12,250
the functional programming community and
then find their way into mainstream

3440
01:10:12,250 --> 01:10:12,260
then find their way into mainstream
 

3441
01:10:12,260 --> 01:10:14,680
then find their way into mainstream
languages yes it's a playground for

3442
01:10:14,680 --> 01:10:14,690
languages yes it's a playground for
 

3443
01:10:14,690 --> 01:10:18,550
languages yes it's a playground for
rebels yeah exactly and and so I think

3444
01:10:18,550 --> 01:10:18,560
rebels yeah exactly and and so I think
 

3445
01:10:18,560 --> 01:10:20,470
rebels yeah exactly and and so I think
the language is in the playground

3446
01:10:20,470 --> 01:10:20,480
the language is in the playground
 

3447
01:10:20,480 --> 01:10:23,110
the language is in the playground
themselves are probably not going to be

3448
01:10:23,110 --> 01:10:23,120
themselves are probably not going to be
 

3449
01:10:23,120 --> 01:10:25,780
themselves are probably not going to be
the mainstream at least for some welp

3450
01:10:25,780 --> 01:10:25,790
the mainstream at least for some welp
 

3451
01:10:25,790 --> 01:10:27,670
the mainstream at least for some welp
but the ideas that come from there are

3452
01:10:27,670 --> 01:10:27,680
but the ideas that come from there are
 

3453
01:10:27,680 --> 01:10:31,450
but the ideas that come from there are
invaluable so let's go to something that

3454
01:10:31,450 --> 01:10:31,460
invaluable so let's go to something that
 

3455
01:10:31,460 --> 01:10:34,720
invaluable so let's go to something that
when I found out recently so I known

3456
01:10:34,720 --> 01:10:34,730
when I found out recently so I known
 

3457
01:10:34,730 --> 01:10:36,400
when I found out recently so I known
that you've done a million things but

3458
01:10:36,400 --> 01:10:36,410
that you've done a million things but
 

3459
01:10:36,410 --> 01:10:37,840
that you've done a million things but
one of the things I wasn't aware of the

3460
01:10:37,840 --> 01:10:37,850
one of the things I wasn't aware of the
 

3461
01:10:37,850 --> 01:10:41,110
one of the things I wasn't aware of the
you had a role in ample and I before you

3462
01:10:41,110 --> 01:10:41,120
you had a role in ample and I before you
 

3463
01:10:41,120 --> 01:10:43,210
you had a role in ample and I before you
interrupt me by minimizing your role in

3464
01:10:43,210 --> 01:10:43,220
interrupt me by minimizing your role in
 

3465
01:10:43,220 --> 01:10:46,000
interrupt me by minimizing your role in
it but your hapless for minimizing

3466
01:10:46,000 --> 01:10:46,010
it but your hapless for minimizing
 

3467
01:10:46,010 --> 01:10:46,480
it but your hapless for minimizing
functions

3468
01:10:46,480 --> 01:10:46,490
functions
 

3469
01:10:46,490 --> 01:10:48,100
functions
yeah minimizing functions right exactly

3470
01:10:48,100 --> 01:10:48,110
yeah minimizing functions right exactly
 

3471
01:10:48,110 --> 01:10:52,390
yeah minimizing functions right exactly
I can't just say that the elegance and

3472
01:10:52,390 --> 01:10:52,400
I can't just say that the elegance and
 

3473
01:10:52,400 --> 01:10:55,500
I can't just say that the elegance and
abstraction power of an ample is

3474
01:10:55,500 --> 01:10:55,510
abstraction power of an ample is
 

3475
01:10:55,510 --> 01:10:58,270
abstraction power of an ample is
incredible all right when I first came

3476
01:10:58,270 --> 01:10:58,280
incredible all right when I first came
 

3477
01:10:58,280 --> 01:11:01,600
incredible all right when I first came
to it about ten years ago or so can you

3478
01:11:01,600 --> 01:11:01,610
to it about ten years ago or so can you
 

3479
01:11:01,610 --> 01:11:04,480
to it about ten years ago or so can you
describe what is the ample language sure

3480
01:11:04,480 --> 01:11:04,490
describe what is the ample language sure
 

3481
01:11:04,490 --> 01:11:07,030
describe what is the ample language sure
so ample is a language for mathematical

3482
01:11:07,030 --> 01:11:07,040
so ample is a language for mathematical
 

3483
01:11:07,040 --> 01:11:09,850
so ample is a language for mathematical
programming technical term think of it

3484
01:11:09,850 --> 01:11:09,860
programming technical term think of it
 

3485
01:11:09,860 --> 01:11:11,530
programming technical term think of it
as linear programming that is setting up

3486
01:11:11,530 --> 01:11:11,540
as linear programming that is setting up
 

3487
01:11:11,540 --> 01:11:16,200
as linear programming that is setting up
systems of linear equations that are

3488
01:11:16,200 --> 01:11:16,210
systems of linear equations that are
 

3489
01:11:16,210 --> 01:11:18,940
systems of linear equations that are
some sort of system of constraints so

3490
01:11:18,940 --> 01:11:18,950
some sort of system of constraints so
 

3491
01:11:18,950 --> 01:11:20,740
some sort of system of constraints so
that you have a bunch of things that

3492
01:11:20,740 --> 01:11:20,750
that you have a bunch of things that
 

3493
01:11:20,750 --> 01:11:22,300
that you have a bunch of things that
have to be less than this greater than

3494
01:11:22,300 --> 01:11:22,310
have to be less than this greater than
 

3495
01:11:22,310 --> 01:11:23,830
have to be less than this greater than
that or whatever and you're trying to

3496
01:11:23,830 --> 01:11:23,840
that or whatever and you're trying to
 

3497
01:11:23,840 --> 01:11:26,650
that or whatever and you're trying to
find a set of values for some decision

3498
01:11:26,650 --> 01:11:26,660
find a set of values for some decision
 

3499
01:11:26,660 --> 01:11:29,910
find a set of values for some decision
variables that will maximize or minimize

3500
01:11:29,910 --> 01:11:29,920
variables that will maximize or minimize
 

3501
01:11:29,920 --> 01:11:33,100
variables that will maximize or minimize
some objective function so it's it's a

3502
01:11:33,100 --> 01:11:33,110
some objective function so it's it's a
 

3503
01:11:33,110 --> 01:11:36,060
some objective function so it's it's a
way of solving a particular kind of

3504
01:11:36,060 --> 01:11:36,070
way of solving a particular kind of
 

3505
01:11:36,070 --> 01:11:38,890
way of solving a particular kind of
optimization problem a very formal sort

3506
01:11:38,890 --> 01:11:38,900
optimization problem a very formal sort
 

3507
01:11:38,900 --> 01:11:40,480
optimization problem a very formal sort
of optimization problem but one that's

3508
01:11:40,480 --> 01:11:40,490
of optimization problem but one that's
 

3509
01:11:40,490 --> 01:11:43,660
of optimization problem but one that's
exceptionally useful and it specifies so

3510
01:11:43,660 --> 01:11:43,670
exceptionally useful and it specifies so
 

3511
01:11:43,670 --> 01:11:45,250
exceptionally useful and it specifies so
there's objective function of

3512
01:11:45,250 --> 01:11:45,260
there's objective function of
 

3513
01:11:45,260 --> 01:11:47,440
there's objective function of
constraints and variables that become

3514
01:11:47,440 --> 01:11:47,450
constraints and variables that become
 

3515
01:11:47,450 --> 01:11:49,510
constraints and variables that become
separate from the data it operates on

3516
01:11:49,510 --> 01:11:49,520
separate from the data it operates on
 

3517
01:11:49,520 --> 01:11:53,410
separate from the data it operates on
right so the that kind of separation

3518
01:11:53,410 --> 01:11:53,420
right so the that kind of separation
 

3519
01:11:53,420 --> 01:11:57,340
right so the that kind of separation
allows you to you know put on different

01:13:25,030 --> 01:13:25,040
up the various constraints so a as a
 

3589
01:13:25,040 --> 01:13:28,780
up the various constraints so a as a
matrix and X and B your vectors and then

3590
01:13:28,780 --> 01:13:28,790
matrix and X and B your vectors and then
 

3591
01:13:28,790 --> 01:13:30,280
matrix and X and B your vectors and then
there's an objective function which is

3592
01:13:30,280 --> 01:13:30,290
there's an objective function which is
 

3593
01:13:30,290 --> 01:13:32,350
there's an objective function which is
just the sum of a bunch of X's and some

3594
01:13:32,350 --> 01:13:32,360
just the sum of a bunch of X's and some
 

3595
01:13:32,360 --> 01:13:34,209
just the sum of a bunch of X's and some
coefficients on them and yet that's the

3596
01:13:34,209 --> 01:13:34,219
coefficients on them and yet that's the
 

3597
01:13:34,219 --> 01:13:37,600
coefficients on them and yet that's the
thing you want to optimize the problem

3598
01:13:37,600 --> 01:13:37,610
thing you want to optimize the problem
 

3599
01:13:37,610 --> 01:13:40,810
thing you want to optimize the problem
is that in the real world that matrix a

3600
01:13:40,810 --> 01:13:40,820
is that in the real world that matrix a
 

3601
01:13:40,820 --> 01:13:43,990
is that in the real world that matrix a
is a very very very intricate very large

3602
01:13:43,990 --> 01:13:44,000
is a very very very intricate very large
 

3603
01:13:44,000 --> 01:13:46,120
is a very very very intricate very large
and very sparse matrix where the various

3604
01:13:46,120 --> 01:13:46,130
and very sparse matrix where the various
 

3605
01:13:46,130 --> 01:13:49,180
and very sparse matrix where the various
components of the model are distributed

3606
01:13:49,180 --> 01:13:49,190
components of the model are distributed
 

3607
01:13:49,190 --> 01:13:51,189
components of the model are distributed
among the coefficients in a way that is

3608
01:13:51,189 --> 01:13:51,199
among the coefficients in a way that is
 

3609
01:13:51,199 --> 01:13:55,959
among the coefficients in a way that is
totally on obvious to anybody and so

3610
01:13:55,959 --> 01:13:55,969
totally on obvious to anybody and so
 

3611
01:13:55,969 --> 01:13:58,990
totally on obvious to anybody and so
what you need is some way to express the

3612
01:13:58,990 --> 01:13:59,000
what you need is some way to express the
 

3613
01:13:59,000 --> 01:14:00,669
what you need is some way to express the
original model which you and I would

3614
01:14:00,669 --> 01:14:00,679
original model which you and I would
 

3615
01:14:00,679 --> 01:14:02,620
original model which you and I would
write you know we'd write mathematics on

3616
01:14:02,620 --> 01:14:02,630
write you know we'd write mathematics on
 

3617
01:14:02,630 --> 01:14:04,450
write you know we'd write mathematics on
the board and the sum of this is greater

3618
01:14:04,450 --> 01:14:04,460
the board and the sum of this is greater
 

3619
01:14:04,460 --> 01:14:06,240
the board and the sum of this is greater
than the sum of that kind of thing so

3620
01:14:06,240 --> 01:14:06,250
than the sum of that kind of thing so
 

3621
01:14:06,250 --> 01:14:09,100
than the sum of that kind of thing so
you need a language to write those kinds

3622
01:14:09,100 --> 01:14:09,110
you need a language to write those kinds
 

3623
01:14:09,110 --> 01:14:12,189
you need a language to write those kinds
of constraints and Bob for a long time

3624
01:14:12,189 --> 01:14:12,199
of constraints and Bob for a long time
 

3625
01:14:12,199 --> 01:14:13,689
of constraints and Bob for a long time
had been interested in modeling

3626
01:14:13,689 --> 01:14:13,699
had been interested in modeling
 

3627
01:14:13,699 --> 01:14:15,370
had been interested in modeling
languages languages that made it

3628
01:14:15,370 --> 01:14:15,380
languages languages that made it
 

3629
01:14:15,380 --> 01:14:17,649
languages languages that made it
possible to do this there was a modeling

3630
01:14:17,649 --> 01:14:17,659
possible to do this there was a modeling
 

3631
01:14:17,659 --> 01:14:19,450
possible to do this there was a modeling
language around called gams the general

3632
01:14:19,450 --> 01:14:19,460
language around called gams the general
 

3633
01:14:19,460 --> 01:14:21,640
language around called gams the general
algebraic modeling system but it looked

3634
01:14:21,640 --> 01:14:21,650
algebraic modeling system but it looked
 

3635
01:14:21,650 --> 01:14:23,350
algebraic modeling system but it looked
very much like Fortran was kind of

3636
01:14:23,350 --> 01:14:23,360
very much like Fortran was kind of
 

3637
01:14:23,360 --> 01:14:23,770
very much like Fortran was kind of
clunky

3638
01:14:23,770 --> 01:14:23,780
clunky
 

3639
01:14:23,780 --> 01:14:26,830
clunky
um and so Bob spent a sabbatical year at

3640
01:14:26,830 --> 01:14:26,840
um and so Bob spent a sabbatical year at
 

3641
01:14:26,840 --> 01:14:31,629
um and so Bob spent a sabbatical year at
Bell Labs in 1984 and he and wasn't in

3642
01:14:31,629 --> 01:14:31,639
Bell Labs in 1984 and he and wasn't in
 

3643
01:14:31,639 --> 01:14:34,000
Bell Labs in 1984 and he and wasn't in
the office across from me and it's

3644
01:14:34,000 --> 01:14:34,010
the office across from me and it's
 

3645
01:14:34,010 --> 01:14:37,120
the office across from me and it's
always geography and he and Dave Gay and

3646
01:14:37,120 --> 01:14:37,130
always geography and he and Dave Gay and
 

3647
01:14:37,130 --> 01:14:38,950
always geography and he and Dave Gay and
I started talking about this kind of

3648
01:14:38,950 --> 01:14:38,960
I started talking about this kind of
 

3649
01:14:38,960 --> 01:14:42,550
I started talking about this kind of
thing and he wanted to design a language

3650
01:14:42,550 --> 01:14:42,560
thing and he wanted to design a language
 

3651
01:14:42,560 --> 01:14:44,410
thing and he wanted to design a language
that would make it so that you could

3652
01:14:44,410 --> 01:14:44,420
that would make it so that you could
 

3653
01:14:44,420 --> 01:14:46,540
that would make it so that you could
take these algebraic specifications you

3654
01:14:46,540 --> 01:14:46,550
take these algebraic specifications you
 

3655
01:14:46,550 --> 01:14:49,840
take these algebraic specifications you
know summation signs over sets and that

3656
01:14:49,840 --> 01:14:49,850
know summation signs over sets and that
 

3657
01:14:49,850 --> 01:14:51,729
know summation signs over sets and that
you would write on the board and convert

3658
01:14:51,729 --> 01:14:51,739
you would write on the board and convert
 

3659
01:14:51,739 --> 01:14:55,299
you would write on the board and convert
them into basically this a matrix

3660
01:14:55,299 --> 01:14:55,309
them into basically this a matrix
 

3661
01:14:55,309 --> 01:14:59,020
them into basically this a matrix
and then pass that off to a solver which

3662
01:14:59,020 --> 01:14:59,030
and then pass that off to a solver which
 

3663
01:14:59,030 --> 01:15:02,829
and then pass that off to a solver which
is an entirely separate thing and so we

3664
01:15:02,829 --> 01:15:02,839
is an entirely separate thing and so we
 

3665
01:15:02,839 --> 01:15:05,079
is an entirely separate thing and so we
talked about the design if the language

3666
01:15:05,079 --> 01:15:05,089
talked about the design if the language
 

3667
01:15:05,089 --> 01:15:06,609
talked about the design if the language
I don't remember any of the details of

3668
01:15:06,609 --> 01:15:06,619
I don't remember any of the details of
 

3669
01:15:06,619 --> 01:15:08,079
I don't remember any of the details of
this now but it's kind of an obvious

3670
01:15:08,079 --> 01:15:08,089
this now but it's kind of an obvious
 

3671
01:15:08,089 --> 01:15:10,569
this now but it's kind of an obvious
thing you're just writing mathematical

3672
01:15:10,569 --> 01:15:10,579
thing you're just writing mathematical
 

3673
01:15:10,579 --> 01:15:13,209
thing you're just writing mathematical
expressions in a Fortran like sorry in

3674
01:15:13,209 --> 01:15:13,219
expressions in a Fortran like sorry in
 

3675
01:15:13,219 --> 01:15:17,709
expressions in a Fortran like sorry in
algebra but textual like language and I

3676
01:15:17,709 --> 01:15:17,719
algebra but textual like language and I
 

3677
01:15:17,719 --> 01:15:20,849
algebra but textual like language and I
wrote the first version of this ample

3678
01:15:20,849 --> 01:15:20,859
wrote the first version of this ample
 

3679
01:15:20,859 --> 01:15:26,229
wrote the first version of this ample
program my first C++ program and that's

3680
01:15:26,229 --> 01:15:26,239
program my first C++ program and that's
 

3681
01:15:26,239 --> 01:15:30,069
program my first C++ program and that's
written in C++ yep and so I did that

3682
01:15:30,069 --> 01:15:30,079
written in C++ yep and so I did that
 

3683
01:15:30,079 --> 01:15:32,319
written in C++ yep and so I did that
fairly quickly we wrote it was you know

3684
01:15:32,319 --> 01:15:32,329
fairly quickly we wrote it was you know
 

3685
01:15:32,329 --> 01:15:33,909
fairly quickly we wrote it was you know
3,000 lines or something so it wasn't

3686
01:15:33,909 --> 01:15:33,919
3,000 lines or something so it wasn't
 

3687
01:15:33,919 --> 01:15:35,469
3,000 lines or something so it wasn't
very big but it just sort of showed the

3688
01:15:35,469 --> 01:15:35,479
very big but it just sort of showed the
 

3689
01:15:35,479 --> 01:15:36,909
very big but it just sort of showed the
feasibility of it that you could

3690
01:15:36,909 --> 01:15:36,919
feasibility of it that you could
 

3691
01:15:36,919 --> 01:15:38,529
feasibility of it that you could
actually do something that was easy for

3692
01:15:38,529 --> 01:15:38,539
actually do something that was easy for
 

3693
01:15:38,539 --> 01:15:42,790
actually do something that was easy for
people to specify models and convert it

3694
01:15:42,790 --> 01:15:42,800
people to specify models and convert it
 

3695
01:15:42,800 --> 01:15:44,229
people to specify models and convert it
into something that a solver could work

3696
01:15:44,229 --> 01:15:44,239
into something that a solver could work
 

3697
01:15:44,239 --> 01:15:46,000
into something that a solver could work
with at the same time as you say that

3698
01:15:46,000 --> 01:15:46,010
with at the same time as you say that
 

3699
01:15:46,010 --> 01:15:47,979
with at the same time as you say that
model and the data are separate thing so

3700
01:15:47,979 --> 01:15:47,989
model and the data are separate thing so
 

3701
01:15:47,989 --> 01:15:50,439
model and the data are separate thing so
one model would then work with all kinds

3702
01:15:50,439 --> 01:15:50,449
one model would then work with all kinds
 

3703
01:15:50,449 --> 01:15:52,029
one model would then work with all kinds
of different data in the same way lots

3704
01:15:52,029 --> 01:15:52,039
of different data in the same way lots
 

3705
01:15:52,039 --> 01:15:53,739
of different data in the same way lots
of programs do the same thing but with

3706
01:15:53,739 --> 01:15:53,749
of programs do the same thing but with
 

3707
01:15:53,749 --> 01:15:55,209
of programs do the same thing but with
different data so one of the really nice

3708
01:15:55,209 --> 01:15:55,219
different data so one of the really nice
 

3709
01:15:55,219 --> 01:15:57,339
different data so one of the really nice
things is the the specification of the

3710
01:15:57,339 --> 01:15:57,349
things is the the specification of the
 

3711
01:15:57,349 --> 01:16:00,399
things is the the specification of the
models human just kind of like as you

3712
01:16:00,399 --> 01:16:00,409
models human just kind of like as you
 

3713
01:16:00,409 --> 01:16:02,829
models human just kind of like as you
say is human readable like I literally

3714
01:16:02,829 --> 01:16:02,839
say is human readable like I literally
 

3715
01:16:02,839 --> 01:16:06,069
say is human readable like I literally
I'm ever on stuff I work I I would send

3716
01:16:06,069 --> 01:16:06,079
I'm ever on stuff I work I I would send
 

3717
01:16:06,079 --> 01:16:08,829
I'm ever on stuff I work I I would send
it to colleagues that I'm pretty sure

3718
01:16:08,829 --> 01:16:08,839
it to colleagues that I'm pretty sure
 

3719
01:16:08,839 --> 01:16:13,299
it to colleagues that I'm pretty sure
never programmed just just to understand

3720
01:16:13,299 --> 01:16:13,309
never programmed just just to understand
 

3721
01:16:13,309 --> 01:16:15,849
never programmed just just to understand
what the optimization problem is I think

3722
01:16:15,849 --> 01:16:15,859
what the optimization problem is I think
 

3723
01:16:15,859 --> 01:16:18,309
what the optimization problem is I think
how hard is it to convert that you said

3724
01:16:18,309 --> 01:16:18,319
how hard is it to convert that you said
 

3725
01:16:18,319 --> 01:16:20,349
how hard is it to convert that you said
you there's a first prototype in C++ to

3726
01:16:20,349 --> 01:16:20,359
you there's a first prototype in C++ to
 

3727
01:16:20,359 --> 01:16:22,299
you there's a first prototype in C++ to
convert that into something that could

3728
01:16:22,299 --> 01:16:22,309
convert that into something that could
 

3729
01:16:22,309 --> 01:16:24,579
convert that into something that could
actually be used by the solver it's not

3730
01:16:24,579 --> 01:16:24,589
actually be used by the solver it's not
 

3731
01:16:24,589 --> 01:16:26,469
actually be used by the solver it's not
too bad because most of the solvers have

3732
01:16:26,469 --> 01:16:26,479
too bad because most of the solvers have
 

3733
01:16:26,479 --> 01:16:28,779
too bad because most of the solvers have
some mechanism that lets them import a

01:16:28,779 --> 01:16:28,789
some mechanism that lets them import a
 

3735
01:16:28,789 --> 01:16:31,000
some mechanism that lets them import a
model in AI form it might be as simple

3736
01:16:31,000 --> 01:16:31,010
model in AI form it might be as simple
 

3737
01:16:31,010 --> 01:16:33,579
model in AI form it might be as simple
as the matrix itself in just some

01:16:33,579 --> 01:16:33,589
as the matrix itself in just some
 

3739
01:16:33,589 --> 01:16:36,639
as the matrix itself in just some
representation or if you're doing things

3740
01:16:36,639 --> 01:16:36,649
representation or if you're doing things
 

3741
01:16:36,649 --> 01:16:38,529
representation or if you're doing things
that are not linear programming and

01:16:38,529 --> 01:16:38,539
that are not linear programming and
 

3743
01:16:38,539 --> 01:16:40,119
that are not linear programming and
there may be some mechanism that you

3744
01:16:40,119 --> 01:16:40,129
there may be some mechanism that you
 

3745
01:16:40,129 --> 01:16:42,489
there may be some mechanism that you
provide things like functions to be

3746
01:16:42,489 --> 01:16:42,499
provide things like functions to be
 

3747
01:16:42,499 --> 01:16:42,909
provide things like functions to be
called

3748
01:16:42,909 --> 01:16:42,919
called
 

3749
01:16:42,919 --> 01:16:48,639
called
or other constraints on the model so so

3750
01:16:48,639 --> 01:16:48,649
or other constraints on the model so so
 

3751
01:16:48,649 --> 01:16:50,319
or other constraints on the model so so
all ample does is to generate that kind

3752
01:16:50,319 --> 01:16:50,329
all ample does is to generate that kind
 

3753
01:16:50,329 --> 01:16:53,619
all ample does is to generate that kind
of thing and then solver deals with all

3754
01:16:53,619 --> 01:16:53,629
of thing and then solver deals with all
 

3755
01:16:53,629 --> 01:16:54,969
of thing and then solver deals with all
the hard work and then when the solver

3756
01:16:54,969 --> 01:16:54,979
the hard work and then when the solver
 

3757
01:16:54,979 --> 01:16:58,119
the hard work and then when the solver
comes back with numbers and Vil converts

3758
01:16:58,119 --> 01:16:58,129
comes back with numbers and Vil converts
 

3759
01:16:58,129 --> 01:17:00,309
comes back with numbers and Vil converts
those back into your original form so

3760
01:17:00,309 --> 01:17:00,319
those back into your original form so
 

3761
01:17:00,319 --> 01:17:01,839
those back into your original form so
you know how much of each thing you

3762
01:17:01,839 --> 01:17:01,849
you know how much of each thing you
 

3763
01:17:01,849 --> 01:17:04,179
you know how much of each thing you
should be buying or making or shipping

3764
01:17:04,179 --> 01:17:04,189
should be buying or making or shipping
 

3765
01:17:04,189 --> 01:17:05,810
should be buying or making or shipping
or what

3766
01:17:05,810 --> 01:17:05,820
or what
 

3767
01:17:05,820 --> 01:17:10,400
or what
so we did that in 84 and I haven't had a

3768
01:17:10,400 --> 01:17:10,410
so we did that in 84 and I haven't had a
 

3769
01:17:10,410 --> 01:17:12,470
so we did that in 84 and I haven't had a
lot to do with it since except that we

3770
01:17:12,470 --> 01:17:12,480
lot to do with it since except that we
 

3771
01:17:12,480 --> 01:17:14,060
lot to do with it since except that we
wrote a couple of versions of a book on

3772
01:17:14,060 --> 01:17:14,070
wrote a couple of versions of a book on
 

3773
01:17:14,070 --> 01:17:16,010
wrote a couple of versions of a book on
which is one of the greatest books ever

3774
01:17:16,010 --> 01:17:16,020
which is one of the greatest books ever
 

3775
01:17:16,020 --> 01:17:18,890
which is one of the greatest books ever
written I love that book I don't know

3776
01:17:18,890 --> 01:17:18,900
written I love that book I don't know
 

3777
01:17:18,900 --> 01:17:21,680
written I love that book I don't know
why it's an excellent book but for wrote

3778
01:17:21,680 --> 01:17:21,690
why it's an excellent book but for wrote
 

3779
01:17:21,690 --> 01:17:23,540
why it's an excellent book but for wrote
most of it and so it's really really

3780
01:17:23,540 --> 01:17:23,550
most of it and so it's really really
 

3781
01:17:23,550 --> 01:17:25,190
most of it and so it's really really
well done he must be a dynamite teacher

3782
01:17:25,190 --> 01:17:25,200
well done he must be a dynamite teacher
 

3783
01:17:25,200 --> 01:17:28,310
well done he must be a dynamite teacher
and typeset in late Dec no no no are you

3784
01:17:28,310 --> 01:17:28,320
and typeset in late Dec no no no are you
 

3785
01:17:28,320 --> 01:17:31,820
and typeset in late Dec no no no are you
kidding I really like in the typography

3786
01:17:31,820 --> 01:17:31,830
kidding I really like in the typography
 

3787
01:17:31,830 --> 01:17:33,830
kidding I really like in the typography
so I don't know we did it with tear off

3788
01:17:33,830 --> 01:17:33,840
so I don't know we did it with tear off
 

3789
01:17:33,840 --> 01:17:35,570
so I don't know we did it with tear off
I don't even know what that is yeah

3790
01:17:35,570 --> 01:17:35,580
I don't even know what that is yeah
 

3791
01:17:35,580 --> 01:17:36,170
I don't even know what that is yeah
exactly

3792
01:17:36,170 --> 01:17:36,180
exactly
 

3793
01:17:36,180 --> 01:17:40,840
exactly
you could go I think of tear off is as a

3794
01:17:40,840 --> 01:17:40,850
you could go I think of tear off is as a
 

3795
01:17:40,850 --> 01:17:44,090
you could go I think of tear off is as a

so what is computational complexity

3848
01:18:54,290 --> 01:18:54,300
so what is computational complexity
 

3849
01:18:54,300 --> 01:18:57,110
so what is computational complexity
theory and do you think these kinds of

3850
01:18:57,110 --> 01:18:57,120
theory and do you think these kinds of
 

3851
01:18:57,120 --> 01:18:59,810
theory and do you think these kinds of
complexity classes especially as you've

3852
01:18:59,810 --> 01:18:59,820
complexity classes especially as you've
 

3853
01:18:59,820 --> 01:19:01,670
complexity classes especially as you've
taught in this modern world there are

partitioning which is this question
 

3875
01:19:26,770 --> 01:19:28,649
partitioning which is this question
you've got a graph that is a nodes and

3876
01:19:28,649 --> 01:19:28,659
you've got a graph that is a nodes and
 

3877
01:19:28,659 --> 01:19:31,080
you've got a graph that is a nodes and
edges kind of graph and the edges have

3878
01:19:31,080 --> 01:19:31,090
edges kind of graph and the edges have
 

3879
01:19:31,090 --> 01:19:32,729
edges kind of graph and the edges have
weights and you just want to divide the

3880
01:19:32,729 --> 01:19:32,739
weights and you just want to divide the
 

3881
01:19:32,739 --> 01:19:35,609
weights and you just want to divide the
nodes into two piles of equal size so

3882
01:19:35,609 --> 01:19:35,619
nodes into two piles of equal size so
 

3883
01:19:35,619 --> 01:19:37,169
nodes into two piles of equal size so
that the number of edges that goes from

3884
01:19:37,169 --> 01:19:37,179
that the number of edges that goes from
 

3885
01:19:37,179 --> 01:19:38,700
that the number of edges that goes from

and about that era and people were very
 

4061
01:23:21,619 --> 01:23:23,319

lesson do you draw from that the

4103
01:24:15,590 --> 01:24:18,920

guess the lesson is that in the short

guess the lesson is that in the short
 

4105
01:24:18,930 --> 01:24:22,250
guess the lesson is that in the short

pessimistic or maybe too optimistic and

01:24:24,800 --> 01:24:24,810
pessimistic or maybe too optimistic and
 

4109
01:24:24,810 --> 01:24:26,330
pessimistic or maybe too optimistic and
in the long run you probably shouldn't

4110
01:24:26,330 --> 01:24:26,340
in the long run you probably shouldn't
 

4111
01:24:26,340 --> 01:24:27,740
in the long run you probably shouldn't
be too pessimist I'm not saying that

4112
01:24:27,740 --> 01:24:27,750
be too pessimist I'm not saying that

01:26:20,240 --> 01:26:20,250
worry the the positive part of that is

01:26:20,250 --> 01:26:23,660
worry the the positive part of that is
what machine learning does is reveal the

4208
01:26:23,660 --> 01:26:23,670
what machine learning does is reveal the
 

4209
01:26:23,670 --> 01:26:25,610
what machine learning does is reveal the
bias in the data and puts a mirror to

4210
01:26:25,610 --> 01:26:25,620
bias in the data and puts a mirror to
 

4211
01:26:25,620 --> 01:26:28,870
bias in the data and puts a mirror to
our own society and in so doing helps us

4212
01:26:28,870 --> 01:26:28,880
our own society and in so doing helps us
 

4213
01:26:28,880 --> 01:26:32,420
our own society and in so doing helps us
remove the bite you know helps us work

4214
01:26:32,420 --> 01:26:32,430
remove the bite you know helps us work
 

4215
01:26:32,430 --> 01:26:35,060
remove the bite you know helps us work
on ourselves it's a mirror to ourselves

4216
01:26:35,060 --> 01:26:35,070
on ourselves it's a mirror to ourselves

yeah that's an optimistic point of view

4218
01:26:37,280 --> 01:26:37,290
yeah that's an optimistic point of view
 

4219
01:26:37,290 --> 01:26:38,960
yeah that's an optimistic point of view
and if it works that way that would be

4220
01:26:38,960 --> 01:26:38,970
and if it works that way that would be
 

4221
01:26:38,970 --> 01:26:40,760
and if it works that way that would be
absolutely great and and what I don't

4222
01:26:40,760 --> 01:26:40,770
absolutely great and and what I don't
 

4223
01:26:40,770 --> 01:26:42,680
absolutely great and and what I don't
know is whether it does work that way or

4224
01:26:42,680 --> 01:26:42,690
know is whether it does work that way or
 

4225
01:26:42,690 --> 01:26:45,500
know is whether it does work that way or
whether the the you know the AI

4226
01:26:45,500 --> 01:26:45,510
whether the the you know the AI
 

4227
01:26:45,510 --> 01:26:46,880

mechanisms or machine learning
 

4229
01:26:46,890 --> 01:26:50,690

that have been wrong in the past and I

4232
01:26:52,820 --> 01:26:52,830
that have been wrong in the past and I
 

4233
01:26:52,830 --> 01:26:55,070
that have been wrong in the past and I
don't know I but I think that's a

don't know I but I think that's a
 

4235
01:26:55,080 --> 01:26:57,140
don't know I but I think that's a
serious thing that we have to be

serious thing that we have to be
 

4237
01:26:57,150 --> 01:26:59,330
serious thing that we have to be

4301
01:28:15,180 --> 01:28:18,860
or are you worried it's some combination
of those I I think almost all

01:28:18,860 --> 01:28:18,870
of those I I think almost all

01:28:22,290 --> 01:28:24,200
technologies over the long run are for

01:28:24,200 --> 01:28:24,210
good but there's plenty of examples

concerns of our privacy might be flipped

4362
01:29:39,830 --> 01:29:39,840
concerns of our privacy might be flipped
 

4363
01:29:39,840 --> 01:29:42,110
concerns of our privacy might be flipped
on their head based purely on human

4364
01:29:42,110 --> 01:29:42,120
on their head based purely on human
 

4365
01:29:42,120 --> 01:29:45,290
on their head based purely on human
psychology versus actual concerns or not

4366
01:29:45,290 --> 01:29:45,300
psychology versus actual concerns or not
 

4367
01:29:45,300 --> 01:29:49,520
psychology versus actual concerns or not
yeah what do you think about Moore's law

4368
01:29:49,520 --> 01:29:49,530
yeah what do you think about Moore's law
 

4369
01:29:49,530 --> 01:29:51,440
yeah what do you think about Moore's law
well you said a lot of stuff we've

4370
01:29:51,440 --> 01:29:51,450
well you said a lot of stuff we've
 

4371
01:29:51,450 --> 01:29:53,480
well you said a lot of stuff we've
talked you talked about what programming

4372
01:29:53,480 --> 01:29:53,490
talked you talked about what programming
 

4373
01:29:53,490 --> 01:29:55,910
talked you talked about what programming
languages in their design and their

4374
01:29:55,910 --> 01:29:55,920
languages in their design and their
 

4375
01:29:55,920 --> 01:29:58,790
languages in their design and their
ideas are come from the constraints and

4376
01:29:58,790 --> 01:29:58,800
ideas are come from the constraints and
 

4377
01:29:58,800 --> 01:30:00,620
ideas are come from the constraints and
the systems they operate and do you

4378
01:30:00,620 --> 01:30:00,630
the systems they operate and do you
 

4379
01:30:00,630 --> 01:30:05,450
the systems they operate and do you
think Moore's Law the the exponential

4380
01:30:05,450 --> 01:30:05,460
think Moore's Law the the exponential
 

4381
01:30:05,460 --> 01:30:07,490
think Moore's Law the the exponential
improvement of systems will continue

4382
01:30:07,490 --> 01:30:07,500
improvement of systems will continue
 

4383
01:30:07,500 --> 01:30:10,280
improvement of systems will continue
indefinitely there's there's mix of

4384
01:30:10,280 --> 01:30:10,290
indefinitely there's there's mix of
 

4385
01:30:10,290 --> 01:30:12,860
indefinitely there's there's mix of
opinions on that currently or do you

4386
01:30:12,860 --> 01:30:12,870
opinions on that currently or do you
 

4387
01:30:12,870 --> 01:30:17,420
opinions on that currently or do you
think do you think there will be do you

4388
01:30:17,420 --> 01:30:17,430
think do you think there will be do you
 

4389
01:30:17,430 --> 01:30:18,470
think do you think there will be do you
think there'll be a plateau

4390
01:30:18,470 --> 01:30:18,480
think there'll be a plateau
 

4391
01:30:18,480 --> 01:30:20,930
think there'll be a plateau
well the furball is answer there's no

4392
01:30:20,930 --> 01:30:20,940
well the furball is answer there's no
 

4393
01:30:20,940 --> 01:30:24,320
well the furball is answer there's no
exponential can go on forever you run

4394
01:30:24,320 --> 01:30:24,330
exponential can go on forever you run
 

4395
01:30:24,330 --> 01:30:25,280
exponential can go on forever you run
out of something

4396
01:30:25,280 --> 01:30:25,290
out of something
 

4397
01:30:25,290 --> 01:30:27,890
out of something
um just as we said timescale matters so

4398
01:30:27,890 --> 01:30:27,900
um just as we said timescale matters so
 

4399
01:30:27,900 --> 01:30:29,510
um just as we said timescale matters so
if it goes on long enough

4400
01:30:29,510 --> 01:30:29,520
if it goes on long enough
 

4401
01:30:29,520 --> 01:30:31,310
if it goes on long enough
that might be all I need yeah right

4402
01:30:31,310 --> 01:30:31,320
that might be all I need yeah right
 

4403
01:30:31,320 --> 01:30:33,860
that might be all I need yeah right
won't matter does uh so I don't know

4404
01:30:33,860 --> 01:30:33,870
won't matter does uh so I don't know
 

4405
01:30:33,870 --> 01:30:35,210
won't matter does uh so I don't know
we've seen places where Moore's law has

4406
01:30:35,210 --> 01:30:35,220
we've seen places where Moore's law has
 

4407
01:30:35,220 --> 01:30:37,340
we've seen places where Moore's law has
changed for example mentioned earlier

4408
01:30:37,340 --> 01:30:37,350
changed for example mentioned earlier
 

4409
01:30:37,350 --> 01:30:40,010

process processors don't get faster

4410
01:30:40,010 --> 01:30:40,020
process processors don't get faster
 

4411
01:30:40,020 --> 01:30:44,570
process processors don't get faster
anymore but you used that same growth of

01:30:44,570 --> 01:30:44,580
anymore but you used that same growth of
 

4413
01:30:44,580 --> 01:30:46,970

01:30:46,970 --> 01:30:46,980
you know building put more things in a

4416
01:30:49,370 --> 01:30:49,380
given area to grow them horizontally
 

4417
01:30:49,380 --> 01:30:51,350
given area to grow them horizontally
instead of vertically as it were so you

4418
01:30:51,350 --> 01:30:51,360
instead of vertically as it were so you
 

4419
01:30:51,360 --> 01:30:52,940
instead of vertically as it were so you
can get more and more processors or

4420
01:30:52,940 --> 01:30:52,950
can get more and more processors or
 

4421
01:30:52,950 --> 01:30:55,340
can get more and more processors or
memory or whatever on the same chip is

4422
01:30:55,340 --> 01:30:55,350
memory or whatever on the same chip is
 

4423
01:30:55,350 --> 01:30:57,290
memory or whatever on the same chip is
that gonna run into a limitation

4424
01:30:57,290 --> 01:30:57,300
that gonna run into a limitation
 

4425
01:30:57,300 --> 01:31:00,410
that gonna run into a limitation
presumably because you know at some

4426
01:31:00,410 --> 01:31:00,420
presumably because you know at some
 

4427
01:31:00,420 --> 01:31:02,180
presumably because you know at some
point you get down to the individual

4428
01:31:02,180 --> 01:31:02,190
point you get down to the individual
 

4429
01:31:02,190 --> 01:31:04,700
point you get down to the individual
atoms and so you got to find some way

4430
01:31:04,700 --> 01:31:04,710
atoms and so you got to find some way
 

4431
01:31:04,710 --> 01:31:06,830
atoms and so you got to find some way
around that will we find some way around

4432
01:31:06,830 --> 01:31:06,840
around that will we find some way around
 

4433
01:31:06,840 --> 01:31:09,290
around that will we find some way around
that I don't know I just said that if I

4434
01:31:09,290 --> 01:31:09,300
that I don't know I just said that if I
 

4435
01:31:09,300 --> 01:31:12,950
that I don't know I just said that if I
say it I'll be wrong we will say I just

4436
01:31:12,950 --> 01:31:12,960
say it I'll be wrong we will say I just
 

4437
01:31:12,960 --> 01:31:15,260
say it I'll be wrong we will say I just
talked to Jim Keller and he says so he

4438
01:31:15,260 --> 01:31:15,270
talked to Jim Keller and he says so he
 

4439
01:31:15,270 --> 01:31:17,060
talked to Jim Keller and he says so he
actually describes he argues that the

4440
01:31:17,060 --> 01:31:17,070
actually describes he argues that the
 

4441
01:31:17,070 --> 01:31:18,980
actually describes he argues that the
Moore's law will continue for a long

4442
01:31:18,980 --> 01:31:18,990
Moore's law will continue for a long
 

4443
01:31:18,990 --> 01:31:21,020
Moore's law will continue for a long
long time because you mentioned the atom

4444
01:31:21,020 --> 01:31:21,030
long time because you mentioned the atom
 

4445
01:31:21,030 --> 01:31:24,200
long time because you mentioned the atom
we actually have I think a thousandfold

4446
01:31:24,200 --> 01:31:24,210
we actually have I think a thousandfold
 

4447
01:31:24,210 --> 01:31:27,620
we actually have I think a thousandfold

transistor size still possible before we

4450
01:31:30,410 --> 01:31:30,420
transistor size still possible before we
 

4451
01:31:30,420 --> 01:31:32,570
transistor size still possible before we
get to the quantum level so it's there's

4452
01:31:32,570 --> 01:31:32,580
get to the quantum level so it's there's
 

4453
01:31:32,580 --> 01:31:35,060
get to the quantum level so it's there's
still a lot of possibilities he thinks

01:31:35,060 --> 01:31:35,070
still a lot of possibilities he thinks

01:31:35,070 --> 01:31:36,800
still a lot of possibilities he thinks
he'll continue indefinitely which is an

01:31:44,130 --> 01:31:46,700
programming languages will change for
this increase whether we hit a wall or

this increase whether we hit a wall or
 

4465
01:31:46,710 --> 01:31:50,030
this increase whether we hit a wall or
not what do you think do you think

4466
01:31:50,030 --> 01:31:50,040
not what do you think do you think
 

4467
01:31:50,040 --> 01:31:51,560
not what do you think do you think
there'll be a fundamental change in the

4468
01:31:51,560 --> 01:31:51,570
there'll be a fundamental change in the
 

4469
01:31:51,570 --> 01:31:53,800
there'll be a fundamental change in the
way programming languages are designed I

4470
01:31:53,800 --> 01:31:53,810
way programming languages are designed I
 

4471
01:31:53,810 --> 01:31:56,330
way programming languages are designed I
don't worry about that I think what will

4472
01:31:56,330 --> 01:31:56,340
don't worry about that I think what will
 

4473
01:31:56,340 --> 01:32:01,010
don't worry about that I think what will
happen is continuation of what we see in

4474
01:32:01,010 --> 01:32:01,020
happen is continuation of what we see in
 

4475
01:32:01,020 --> 01:32:03,950
happen is continuation of what we see in
some areas at least which is that more

4476
01:32:03,950 --> 01:32:03,960
some areas at least which is that more
 

4477
01:32:03,960 --> 01:32:06,260
some areas at least which is that more
programming will be done by programs

4478
01:32:06,260 --> 01:32:06,270
programming will be done by programs
 

4479
01:32:06,270 --> 01:32:10,550
programming will be done by programs
than by people and that more will be

4480
01:32:10,550 --> 01:32:10,560
than by people and that more will be
 

4481
01:32:10,560 --> 01:32:13,250
than by people and that more will be
done by sort of declarative rather than

4482
01:32:13,250 --> 01:32:13,260
done by sort of declarative rather than
 

4483
01:32:13,260 --> 01:32:16,070
done by sort of declarative rather than
procedural mechanisms where I say I want

4484
01:32:16,070 --> 01:32:16,080
procedural mechanisms where I say I want
 

4485
01:32:16,080 --> 01:32:20,590

this to happen you figure out how and

4486
01:32:20,590 --> 01:32:20,600
this to happen you figure out how and
 

4487
01:32:20,600 --> 01:32:23,780
this to happen you figure out how and
that is in many cases at this point

4488
01:32:23,780 --> 01:32:23,790
that is in many cases at this point
 

4489
01:32:23,790 --> 01:32:26,840
that is in many cases at this point

domain of specialized languages for
 

4491
01:32:26,850 --> 01:32:30,560
domain of specialized languages for
narrow domains but you can imagine that

4492
01:32:30,560 --> 01:32:30,570
narrow domains but you can imagine that
 

4493
01:32:30,570 --> 01:32:32,870
narrow domains but you can imagine that
broadening out and so I don't have to

01:32:32,870 --> 01:32:32,880
broadening out and so I don't have to
 

4495

that experience what advice do you have

4518
01:33:07,560 --> 01:33:07,570
that experience what advice do you have
 

4519
01:33:07,570 --> 01:33:09,479
that experience what advice do you have
for people who don't know anything about

4520
01:33:09,479 --> 01:33:09,489
for people who don't know anything about
 

4521
01:33:09,489 --> 01:33:11,250
for people who don't know anything about
programming but I'm kind of curious

4522
01:33:11,250 --> 01:33:11,260
programming but I'm kind of curious
 

4523
01:33:11,260 --> 01:33:13,950
programming but I'm kind of curious
about this world or programming seems to

4524
01:33:13,950 --> 01:33:13,960
about this world or programming seems to
 

4525
01:33:13,960 --> 01:33:15,570
about this world or programming seems to
become more and more of a fundamental

4526
01:33:15,570 --> 01:33:15,580
become more and more of a fundamental
 

4527
01:33:15,580 --> 01:33:17,400
become more and more of a fundamental
skill that people need to be at least

4528
01:33:17,400 --> 01:33:17,410
skill that people need to be at least
 

4529
01:33:17,410 --> 01:33:19,530
skill that people need to be at least
the world yeah well I could recommend a

4530
01:33:19,530 --> 01:33:19,540
the world yeah well I could recommend a
 

4531
01:33:19,540 --> 01:33:23,760
the world yeah well I could recommend a
good book what's that for the course I

4532
01:33:23,760 --> 01:33:23,770
good book what's that for the course I
 

4533
01:33:23,770 --> 01:33:26,760
good book what's that for the course I
think this is one of these questions of

4534
01:33:26,760 --> 01:33:26,770
think this is one of these questions of
 

4535
01:33:26,770 --> 01:33:28,560
think this is one of these questions of
should everybody know how to program and

4536
01:33:28,560 --> 01:33:28,570
should everybody know how to program and
 

4537
01:33:28,570 --> 01:33:31,410
should everybody know how to program and
I think the answer is probably not but I

4538
01:33:31,410 --> 01:33:31,420
I think the answer is probably not but I
 

4539
01:33:31,420 --> 01:33:32,370
I think the answer is probably not but I
think everybody should at least

4540
01:33:32,370 --> 01:33:32,380
think everybody should at least
 

4541
01:33:32,380 --> 01:33:34,650
think everybody should at least
understand sort of what it is so that if

4542
01:33:34,650 --> 01:33:34,660
understand sort of what it is so that if
 

4543
01:33:34,660 --> 01:33:36,300
understand sort of what it is so that if
you say to somebody I'm a programmer

4544
01:33:36,300 --> 01:33:36,310
you say to somebody I'm a programmer
 

4545
01:33:36,310 --> 01:33:37,950
you say to somebody I'm a programmer
they have a notion of what that might be

4546
01:33:37,950 --> 01:33:37,960
they have a notion of what that might be
 

4547
01:33:37,960 --> 01:33:40,709
they have a notion of what that might be
or if you say this is a program or this

4548
01:33:40,709 --> 01:33:40,719
or if you say this is a program or this
 

4549
01:33:40,719 --> 01:33:42,750
or if you say this is a program or this
was decided by a computer running a

4550
01:33:42,750 --> 01:33:42,760
was decided by a computer running a
 

4551
01:33:42,760 --> 01:33:45,440
was decided by a computer running a
program that they have some vague

4552
01:33:45,440 --> 01:33:45,450
program that they have some vague
 

4553
01:33:45,450 --> 01:33:48,420
program that they have some vague
intuitive understanding and an accurate

4554
01:33:48,420 --> 01:33:48,430
intuitive understanding and an accurate
 

4555
01:33:48,430 --> 01:33:51,800
intuitive understanding and an accurate
understanding of what that might imply

4556
01:33:51,800 --> 01:33:51,810
understanding of what that might imply
 

4557
01:33:51,810 --> 01:33:54,959
understanding of what that might imply
so part of what I'm doing in this course

4558
01:33:54,959 --> 01:33:54,969
so part of what I'm doing in this course
 

4559
01:33:54,969 --> 01:33:56,310
so part of what I'm doing in this course
which is very definitely for

4560
01:33:56,310 --> 01:33:56,320
which is very definitely for
 

4561
01:33:56,320 --> 01:33:58,050
which is very definitely for
non-technical people I mean typical

4562
01:33:58,050 --> 01:33:58,060
non-technical people I mean typical
 

4563
01:33:58,060 --> 01:33:59,760
non-technical people I mean typical
person in it is a history or English

4564
01:33:59,760 --> 01:33:59,770
person in it is a history or English
 

4565
01:33:59,770 --> 01:34:03,270
person in it is a history or English
major try and explain how computers work

4566
01:34:03,270 --> 01:34:03,280
major try and explain how computers work
 

4567
01:34:03,280 --> 01:34:05,760
major try and explain how computers work
how they do their thing what programming

4568
01:34:05,760 --> 01:34:05,770
how they do their thing what programming
 

4569
01:34:05,770 --> 01:34:09,270
how they do their thing what programming
is how you write a program and how

4570
01:34:09,270 --> 01:34:09,280
is how you write a program and how
 

4571
01:34:09,280 --> 01:34:12,120
is how you write a program and how
computers talk to each other and what do

4572
01:34:12,120 --> 01:34:12,130
computers talk to each other and what do
 

4573
01:34:12,130 --> 01:34:13,410
computers talk to each other and what do
they do when they're talking to each

4574
01:34:13,410 --> 01:34:13,420
they do when they're talking to each
 

4575
01:34:13,420 --> 01:34:18,870
they do when they're talking to each
other and then I would say nobody very

4576
01:34:18,870 --> 01:34:18,880
other and then I would say nobody very
 

4577
01:34:18,880 --> 01:34:21,420
other and then I would say nobody very
rarely and does anybody in that course

4578
01:34:21,420 --> 01:34:21,430
rarely and does anybody in that course
 

4579
01:34:21,430 --> 01:34:22,979
rarely and does anybody in that course
go on to become a real serious

4580
01:34:22,979 --> 01:34:22,989
go on to become a real serious
 

4581
01:34:22,989 --> 01:34:25,080
go on to become a real serious
programmer but at least they've got a

4582
01:34:25,080 --> 01:34:25,090
programmer but at least they've got a
 

4583
01:34:25,090 --> 01:34:27,840
programmer but at least they've got a
somewhat better idea of what all this

4584
01:34:27,840 --> 01:34:27,850
somewhat better idea of what all this
 

4585
01:34:27,850 --> 01:34:29,580
somewhat better idea of what all this
stuff is about not just the programming

4586
01:34:29,580 --> 01:34:29,590
stuff is about not just the programming
 

4587
01:34:29,590 --> 01:34:31,650
stuff is about not just the programming
but the technology behind computers and

4588
01:34:31,650 --> 01:34:31,660
but the technology behind computers and
 

4589
01:34:31,660 --> 01:34:33,959
but the technology behind computers and
communications do they write up do they

4590
01:34:33,959 --> 01:34:33,969
communications do they write up do they
 

4591
01:34:33,969 --> 01:34:35,670
communications do they write up do they
try and write a program themselves oh

4592
01:34:35,670 --> 01:34:35,680
try and write a program themselves oh
 

4593
01:34:35,680 --> 01:34:38,090
try and write a program themselves oh
yeah yeah a very small amount I

4594
01:34:38,090 --> 01:34:38,100
yeah yeah a very small amount I
 

4595
01:34:38,100 --> 01:34:40,740
yeah yeah a very small amount I
introduced them to how machines work at

4596
01:34:40,740 --> 01:34:40,750
introduced them to how machines work at
 

4597
01:34:40,750 --> 01:34:43,140
introduced them to how machines work at
a level below high-level languages so we

4598
01:34:43,140 --> 01:34:43,150
a level below high-level languages so we
 

4599
01:34:43,150 --> 01:34:45,540
a level below high-level languages so we
have a kind of a toy machine and has a

4600
01:34:45,540 --> 01:34:45,550
have a kind of a toy machine and has a
 

4601
01:34:45,550 --> 01:34:47,700
have a kind of a toy machine and has a
very small repertoire dozen instructions

4602
01:34:47,700 --> 01:34:47,710
very small repertoire dozen instructions
 

4603
01:34:47,710 --> 01:34:50,100
very small repertoire dozen instructions
and they write trivial assembly language

4604
01:34:50,100 --> 01:34:50,110
and they write trivial assembly language
 

4605
01:34:50,110 --> 01:34:53,340
and they write trivial assembly language
program Wow that's okay

4606
01:34:53,340 --> 01:34:53,350
program Wow that's okay
 

4607
01:34:53,350 --> 01:34:55,080
program Wow that's okay
just if you were to give a flavor to

4608
01:34:55,080 --> 01:34:55,090
just if you were to give a flavor to
 

4609
01:34:55,090 --> 01:34:57,900
just if you were to give a flavor to
people of the programming world for the

4610
01:34:57,900 --> 01:34:57,910
people of the programming world for the
 

4611
01:34:57,910 --> 01:35:00,450
people of the programming world for the
competing world what what are the

4612
01:35:00,450 --> 01:35:00,460
competing world what what are the
 

4613
01:35:00,460 --> 01:35:02,250
competing world what what are the
examples it should go with so a little

4614
01:35:02,250 --> 01:35:02,260
examples it should go with so a little
 

4615
01:35:02,260 --> 01:35:04,500
examples it should go with so a little
bit of assembly to get a sense at the

4616
01:35:04,500 --> 01:35:04,510
bit of assembly to get a sense at the
 

4617
01:35:04,510 --> 01:35:06,680
bit of assembly to get a sense at the
lowest level of what the program is

4618
01:35:06,680 --> 01:35:06,690
lowest level of what the program is
 

4619
01:35:06,690 --> 01:35:10,380
lowest level of what the program is
really doing yeah there's I mean in some

4620
01:35:10,380 --> 01:35:10,390
really doing yeah there's I mean in some
 

4621
01:35:10,390 --> 01:35:11,760
really doing yeah there's I mean in some
sense there's no such thing as the

4622
01:35:11,760 --> 01:35:11,770
sense there's no such thing as the
 

4623
01:35:11,770 --> 01:35:13,260
sense there's no such thing as the
lowest level because you can keep going

4624
01:35:13,260 --> 01:35:13,270
lowest level because you can keep going
 

4625
01:35:13,270 --> 01:35:14,700
lowest level because you can keep going
down but that's the place where I drew

4626
01:35:14,700 --> 01:35:14,710
down but that's the place where I drew
 

4627
01:35:14,710 --> 01:35:17,190
down but that's the place where I drew
the line so the idea that computers have

4628
01:35:17,190 --> 01:35:17,200
the line so the idea that computers have
 

4629
01:35:17,200 --> 01:35:20,190
the line so the idea that computers have
a fairly small repertoire of very simple

4630
01:35:20,190 --> 01:35:20,200
a fairly small repertoire of very simple
 

4631
01:35:20,200 --> 01:35:22,110
a fairly small repertoire of very simple
instructions that they can do like add

4632
01:35:22,110 --> 01:35:22,120
instructions that they can do like add
 

4633
01:35:22,120 --> 01:35:25,080
instructions that they can do like add
and subtract and and branch and so on as

4634
01:35:25,080 --> 01:35:25,090
and subtract and and branch and so on as
 

4635
01:35:25,090 --> 01:35:29,280
and subtract and and branch and so on as
you mentioned earlier and that you can

4636
01:35:29,280 --> 01:35:29,290
you mentioned earlier and that you can
 

4637
01:35:29,290 --> 01:35:32,010
you mentioned earlier and that you can
write code at that level and it will get

4638
01:35:32,010 --> 01:35:32,020
write code at that level and it will get
 

4639
01:35:32,020 --> 01:35:34,650
write code at that level and it will get
things done and then you have the levels

4640
01:35:34,650 --> 01:35:34,660
things done and then you have the levels
 

4641
01:35:34,660 --> 01:35:36,210
things done and then you have the levels
of abstraction that we get with

4642
01:35:36,210 --> 01:35:36,220
of abstraction that we get with
 

4643
01:35:36,220 --> 01:35:38,820
of abstraction that we get with
higher-level languages like Fortran or C

4644
01:35:38,820 --> 01:35:38,830
higher-level languages like Fortran or C
 

4645
01:35:38,830 --> 01:35:41,250
higher-level languages like Fortran or C
or whatever and that makes it easier to

4646
01:35:41,250 --> 01:35:41,260
or whatever and that makes it easier to
 

4647
01:35:41,260 --> 01:35:43,260
or whatever and that makes it easier to
write the code and less dependent on

4648
01:35:43,260 --> 01:35:43,270
write the code and less dependent on
 

4649
01:35:43,270 --> 01:35:46,350
write the code and less dependent on
particular architectures and then we

4650
01:35:46,350 --> 01:35:46,360
particular architectures and then we
 

4651
01:35:46,360 --> 01:35:48,030
particular architectures and then we
talk about a lot of the different kinds

4652
01:35:48,030 --> 01:35:48,040
talk about a lot of the different kinds
 

4653
01:35:48,040 --> 01:35:50,520
talk about a lot of the different kinds
of programs that they use all the time

4654
01:35:50,520 --> 01:35:50,530
of programs that they use all the time
 

4655
01:35:50,530 --> 01:35:51,960
of programs that they use all the time
that they don't probably realize our

4656
01:35:51,960 --> 01:35:51,970
that they don't probably realize our
 

4657
01:35:51,970 --> 01:35:55,680
that they don't probably realize our
programs like they're running Mac OS on

4658
01:35:55,680 --> 01:35:55,690
programs like they're running Mac OS on
 

4659
01:35:55,690 --> 01:35:59,220
programs like they're running Mac OS on
their computers or maybe Windows and

4660
01:35:59,220 --> 01:35:59,230
their computers or maybe Windows and
 

4661
01:35:59,230 --> 01:36:00,750
their computers or maybe Windows and
they're downloading apps on their phones

4662
01:36:00,750 --> 01:36:00,760
they're downloading apps on their phones
 

4663
01:36:00,760 --> 01:36:02,400
they're downloading apps on their phones
and all of those things are programs

4664
01:36:02,400 --> 01:36:02,410
and all of those things are programs
 

4665
01:36:02,410 --> 01:36:05,430
and all of those things are programs
that are just what we just talked about

4666
01:36:05,430 --> 01:36:05,440
that are just what we just talked about
 

4667
01:36:05,440 --> 01:36:08,850
that are just what we just talked about
except at a grand scale it's easy to

4668
01:36:08,850 --> 01:36:08,860
except at a grand scale it's easy to
 

4669
01:36:08,860 --> 01:36:10,620
except at a grand scale it's easy to
forget that they're actual programs that

4670
01:36:10,620 --> 01:36:10,630
forget that they're actual programs that
 

4671
01:36:10,630 --> 01:36:12,630
forget that they're actual programs that
people program there's engineers they

4672
01:36:12,630 --> 01:36:12,640
people program there's engineers they
 

4673
01:36:12,640 --> 01:36:14,850
people program there's engineers they
wrote wrote those things yeah right and

4674
01:36:14,850 --> 01:36:14,860
wrote wrote those things yeah right and
 

4675
01:36:14,860 --> 01:36:19,140
wrote wrote those things yeah right and
so in a way I'm expecting them to make

4676
01:36:19,140 --> 01:36:19,150
so in a way I'm expecting them to make
 

4677
01:36:19,150 --> 01:36:21,750
so in a way I'm expecting them to make
an enormous conceptual leap from their 5

4678
01:36:21,750 --> 01:36:21,760
an enormous conceptual leap from their 5
 

4679
01:36:21,760 --> 01:36:24,510
an enormous conceptual leap from their 5
or 10 line toy assembly language thing

4680
01:36:24,510 --> 01:36:24,520
or 10 line toy assembly language thing
 

4681
01:36:24,520 --> 01:36:27,480
or 10 line toy assembly language thing
that adds two or three numbers to you

4682
01:36:27,480 --> 01:36:27,490
that adds two or three numbers to you
 

4683
01:36:27,490 --> 01:36:29,730
that adds two or three numbers to you
know something that is a browser on

4684
01:36:29,730 --> 01:36:29,740
know something that is a browser on
 

4685
01:36:29,740 --> 01:36:32,310
know something that is a browser on
their phone or whatever but but it's

4686
01:36:32,310 --> 01:36:32,320
their phone or whatever but but it's
 

4687
01:36:32,320 --> 01:36:35,190
their phone or whatever but but it's
really the same thing if you look at the

4688
01:36:35,190 --> 01:36:35,200
really the same thing if you look at the
 

4689
01:36:35,200 --> 01:36:38,520
really the same thing if you look at the
broad and broad strokes at history what

4690
01:36:38,520 --> 01:36:38,530
broad and broad strokes at history what
 

4691
01:36:38,530 --> 01:36:39,990
broad and broad strokes at history what
do you think the world like how do you

4692
01:36:39,990 --> 01:36:40,000
do you think the world like how do you
 

4693
01:36:40,000 --> 01:36:41,190
do you think the world like how do you
think the world change because of

4694
01:36:41,190 --> 01:36:41,200
think the world change because of
 

4695
01:36:41,200 --> 01:36:44,460
think the world change because of
computers it's hard to sometimes see the

4696
01:36:44,460 --> 01:36:44,470
computers it's hard to sometimes see the
 

4697
01:36:44,470 --> 01:36:46,560
computers it's hard to sometimes see the
big picture when you're in it you know

4698
01:36:46,560 --> 01:36:46,570
big picture when you're in it you know
 

4699
01:36:46,570 --> 01:36:48,390
big picture when you're in it you know
but I guess I'm asking if there's

4700
01:36:48,390 --> 01:36:48,400
but I guess I'm asking if there's
 

4701
01:36:48,400 --> 01:36:50,460
but I guess I'm asking if there's
something you've noticed over the years

4702
01:36:50,460 --> 01:36:50,470
something you've noticed over the years
 

4703
01:36:50,470 --> 01:36:54,600
something you've noticed over the years
that like you were mentioned the

4704
01:36:54,600 --> 01:36:54,610
that like you were mentioned the
 

4705
01:36:54,610 --> 01:36:56,310
that like you were mentioned the
students are more distracted looking at

4706
01:36:56,310 --> 01:36:56,320
students are more distracted looking at
 

4707
01:36:56,320 --> 01:36:58,110
students are more distracted looking at
their now there's a device to look at

4708
01:36:58,110 --> 01:36:58,120
their now there's a device to look at
 

4709
01:36:58,120 --> 01:37:00,540
their now there's a device to look at
right well I think computing has changed

4710
01:37:00,540 --> 01:37:00,550
right well I think computing has changed
 

4711
01:37:00,550 --> 01:37:02,490
right well I think computing has changed
its rendus amount and obviously but I

4712
01:37:02,490 --> 01:37:02,500
its rendus amount and obviously but I
 

4713
01:37:02,500 --> 01:37:04,470
its rendus amount and obviously but I
think one aspect of that is the way that

4714
01:37:04,470 --> 01:37:04,480
think one aspect of that is the way that
 

4715
01:37:04,480 --> 01:37:06,459
think one aspect of that is the way that
people interact with each other

4716
01:37:06,459 --> 01:37:06,469
people interact with each other
 

4717
01:37:06,469 --> 01:37:10,180
people interact with each other
both locally and faraway and when I was

4718
01:37:10,180 --> 01:37:10,190
both locally and faraway and when I was
 

4719
01:37:10,190 --> 01:37:12,700
both locally and faraway and when I was
you know the age of those kids making a

4720
01:37:12,700 --> 01:37:12,710
you know the age of those kids making a
 

4721
01:37:12,710 --> 01:37:14,800
you know the age of those kids making a
phone call to somewhere was a big deal

4722
01:37:14,800 --> 01:37:14,810
phone call to somewhere was a big deal
 

4723
01:37:14,810 --> 01:37:17,500
phone call to somewhere was a big deal
because it cost serious money and this

4724
01:37:17,500 --> 01:37:17,510
because it cost serious money and this
 

4725
01:37:17,510 --> 01:37:21,790
because it cost serious money and this
was in the 60s right and today people

4726
01:37:21,790 --> 01:37:21,800
was in the 60s right and today people
 

4727
01:37:21,800 --> 01:37:23,709
was in the 60s right and today people
don't make phone calls they send texts

4728
01:37:23,709 --> 01:37:23,719
don't make phone calls they send texts
 

4729
01:37:23,719 --> 01:37:26,620
don't make phone calls they send texts
or something like that so it there's a

4730
01:37:26,620 --> 01:37:26,630
or something like that so it there's a
 

4731
01:37:26,630 --> 01:37:29,770
or something like that so it there's a
up and down and what people do people

4732
01:37:29,770 --> 01:37:29,780
up and down and what people do people
 

4733
01:37:29,780 --> 01:37:33,630
up and down and what people do people
think nothing of having correspondence

4734
01:37:33,630 --> 01:37:33,640
think nothing of having correspondence
 

4735
01:37:33,640 --> 01:37:36,700
think nothing of having correspondence
regular meetings video whatever with

4736
01:37:36,700 --> 01:37:36,710
regular meetings video whatever with
 

4737
01:37:36,710 --> 01:37:38,950
regular meetings video whatever with
friends or family or whatever in any

4738
01:37:38,950 --> 01:37:38,960
friends or family or whatever in any
 

4739
01:37:38,960 --> 01:37:40,840
friends or family or whatever in any
other part of the world and they don't

4740
01:37:40,840 --> 01:37:40,850
other part of the world and they don't
 

4741
01:37:40,850 --> 01:37:43,570
other part of the world and they don't
think about that at all they and so

4742
01:37:43,570 --> 01:37:43,580
think about that at all they and so
 

4743
01:37:43,580 --> 01:37:46,570
think about that at all they and so
that's just the communication aspect of

4744
01:37:46,570 --> 01:37:46,580
that's just the communication aspect of
 

4745
01:37:46,580 --> 01:37:49,870
that's just the communication aspect of
it and do you think that brings us

4746
01:37:49,870 --> 01:37:49,880
it and do you think that brings us
 

4747
01:37:49,880 --> 01:37:54,670
it and do you think that brings us
closer together or does it make us do

4748
01:37:54,670 --> 01:37:54,680
closer together or does it make us do
 

4749
01:37:54,680 --> 01:37:57,370
closer together or does it make us do
this does it take us away from the

4750
01:37:57,370 --> 01:37:57,380
this does it take us away from the
 

4751
01:37:57,380 --> 01:37:59,590
this does it take us away from the
closeness of human human contact I think

4752
01:37:59,590 --> 01:37:59,600
closeness of human human contact I think
 

4753
01:37:59,600 --> 01:38:02,650
closeness of human human contact I think
it depends a lot on all kinds of things

4754
01:38:02,650 --> 01:38:02,660
it depends a lot on all kinds of things
 

4755
01:38:02,660 --> 01:38:04,600
it depends a lot on all kinds of things
so I trade mail with my brother and

4756
01:38:04,600 --> 01:38:04,610
so I trade mail with my brother and
 

4757
01:38:04,610 --> 01:38:07,000
so I trade mail with my brother and
sister in Canada much more often than I

4758
01:38:07,000 --> 01:38:07,010
sister in Canada much more often than I
 

4759
01:38:07,010 --> 01:38:08,740
sister in Canada much more often than I
used to talk to them on the phone

4760
01:38:08,740 --> 01:38:08,750
used to talk to them on the phone
 

4761
01:38:08,750 --> 01:38:10,959
used to talk to them on the phone
so probably every 2 or 3 days I get

4762
01:38:10,959 --> 01:38:10,969
so probably every 2 or 3 days I get
 

4763
01:38:10,969 --> 01:38:13,800
so probably every 2 or 3 days I get
something or send something to them

4764
01:38:13,800 --> 01:38:13,810
something or send something to them
 

4765
01:38:13,810 --> 01:38:18,010
something or send something to them
whereas 20 years ago I probably wouldn't

4766
01:38:18,010 --> 01:38:18,020
whereas 20 years ago I probably wouldn't
 

4767
01:38:18,020 --> 01:38:20,229
whereas 20 years ago I probably wouldn't
have talked to them on the phone nearly

4768
01:38:20,229 --> 01:38:20,239
have talked to them on the phone nearly
 

4769
01:38:20,239 --> 01:38:21,790
have talked to them on the phone nearly
as much so in that sense I that's

4770
01:38:21,790 --> 01:38:21,800
as much so in that sense I that's
 

4771
01:38:21,800 --> 01:38:23,200
as much so in that sense I that's
brought my brother and sister and I

4772
01:38:23,200 --> 01:38:23,210
brought my brother and sister and I
 

4773
01:38:23,210 --> 01:38:25,689
brought my brother and sister and I
closer together that's a good thing um I

4774
01:38:25,689 --> 01:38:25,699
closer together that's a good thing um I
 

4775
01:38:25,699 --> 01:38:29,050
closer together that's a good thing um I
watch the kids on campus and they're

4776
01:38:29,050 --> 01:38:29,060
watch the kids on campus and they're
 

4777
01:38:29,060 --> 01:38:30,520
watch the kids on campus and they're
mostly walking around with their heads

4778
01:38:30,520 --> 01:38:30,530
mostly walking around with their heads
 

4779
01:38:30,530 --> 01:38:32,380
mostly walking around with their heads
down fooling with their phones to the

4780
01:38:32,380 --> 01:38:32,390
down fooling with their phones to the
 

4781
01:38:32,390 --> 01:38:34,709
down fooling with their phones to the
point where I have to duck them yeah I

4782
01:38:34,709 --> 01:38:34,719
point where I have to duck them yeah I
 

4783
01:38:34,719 --> 01:38:37,660
point where I have to duck them yeah I
don't know that that has brought them

4784
01:38:37,660 --> 01:38:37,670
don't know that that has brought them
 

4785
01:38:37,670 --> 01:38:41,310
don't know that that has brought them
closer together in some ways there's

4786
01:38:41,310 --> 01:38:41,320
closer together in some ways there's
 

4787
01:38:41,320 --> 01:38:43,300
closer together in some ways there's
sociological research that says people

4788
01:38:43,300 --> 01:38:43,310
sociological research that says people
 

4789
01:38:43,310 --> 01:38:45,160
sociological research that says people
are in fact not as close together as

4790
01:38:45,160 --> 01:38:45,170
are in fact not as close together as
 

4791
01:38:45,170 --> 01:38:46,840
are in fact not as close together as
they used to be I don't know whether

4792
01:38:46,840 --> 01:38:46,850
they used to be I don't know whether
 

4793
01:38:46,850 --> 01:38:49,090
they used to be I don't know whether
that's really true but but I can see

4794
01:38:49,090 --> 01:38:49,100
that's really true but but I can see
 

4795
01:38:49,100 --> 01:38:52,689
that's really true but but I can see
potential downsides and kids where you

4796
01:38:52,689 --> 01:38:52,699
potential downsides and kids where you
 

4797
01:38:52,699 --> 01:38:55,000
potential downsides and kids where you
think come on wake up and smell the

4798
01:38:55,000 --> 01:38:55,010
think come on wake up and smell the
 

4799
01:38:55,010 --> 01:38:57,640
think come on wake up and smell the
coffee or whatever that's right but if

4800
01:38:57,640 --> 01:38:57,650
coffee or whatever that's right but if
 

4801
01:38:57,650 --> 01:38:59,920
coffee or whatever that's right but if
you look at again nobody can predict the

4802
01:38:59,920 --> 01:38:59,930
you look at again nobody can predict the
 

4803
01:38:59,930 --> 01:39:03,160
you look at again nobody can predict the
future but are you excited kind of touch

4804
01:39:03,160 --> 01:39:03,170
future but are you excited kind of touch
 

4805
01:39:03,170 --> 01:39:06,100
future but are you excited kind of touch
this a little bit with with AI but are

4806
01:39:06,100 --> 01:39:06,110
this a little bit with with AI but are
 

4807
01:39:06,110 --> 01:39:08,050
this a little bit with with AI but are
you excited by the future in the next 10

4808
01:39:08,050 --> 01:39:08,060
you excited by the future in the next 10
 

4809
01:39:08,060 --> 01:39:11,590
you excited by the future in the next 10
20 years the computing will bring you

4810
01:39:11,590 --> 01:39:11,600
20 years the computing will bring you
 

4811
01:39:11,600 --> 01:39:14,709
20 years the computing will bring you
viewer there when there was no computers

4812
01:39:14,709 --> 01:39:14,719
viewer there when there was no computers
 

4813
01:39:14,719 --> 01:39:17,430
viewer there when there was no computers
really and now computers are everywhere

4814
01:39:17,430 --> 01:39:17,440
really and now computers are everywhere
 

4815
01:39:17,440 --> 01:39:20,109
really and now computers are everywhere
all over the world and

4816
01:39:20,109 --> 01:39:20,119
all over the world and
 

4817
01:39:20,119 --> 01:39:22,509
all over the world and
Africa and Asia and just every every

4818
01:39:22,509 --> 01:39:22,519
Africa and Asia and just every every
 

4819
01:39:22,519 --> 01:39:24,250
Africa and Asia and just every every
person almost every person the wall has

4820
01:39:24,250 --> 01:39:24,260
person almost every person the wall has
 

4821
01:39:24,260 --> 01:39:27,399
person almost every person the wall has
a device so are you hopeful optimistic

4822
01:39:27,399 --> 01:39:27,409
a device so are you hopeful optimistic
 

4823
01:39:27,409 --> 01:39:31,629
a device so are you hopeful optimistic
about that future I it's mixed if the

4824
01:39:31,629 --> 01:39:31,639
about that future I it's mixed if the
 

4825
01:39:31,639 --> 01:39:33,159
about that future I it's mixed if the
truth be told I mean I think there are

4826
01:39:33,159 --> 01:39:33,169
