00:05:52,870 --> 00:05:52,880
i would want to make the the receipt add
 

337
00:05:52,880 --> 00:05:55,590
i would want to make the the receipt add
up to an interesting number

338
00:05:55,590 --> 00:05:55,600
up to an interesting number
 

339
00:05:55,600 --> 00:05:57,110
up to an interesting number
is there some numbers that stuck with

340
00:05:57,110 --> 00:05:57,120
is there some numbers that stuck with
 

341
00:05:57,120 --> 00:05:59,830
is there some numbers that stuck with
you that just kind of make you feel good

342
00:05:59,830 --> 00:05:59,840
you that just kind of make you feel good
 

343
00:05:59,840 --> 00:06:02,390
you that just kind of make you feel good
they all have a story and fortunately

344
00:06:02,390 --> 00:06:02,400
they all have a story and fortunately
 

345
00:06:02,400 --> 00:06:03,749
they all have a story and fortunately
i've actually

346
00:06:03,749 --> 00:06:03,759
i've actually
 

347
00:06:03,759 --> 00:06:07,430
i've actually
mostly forgotten all of them

348
00:06:07,430 --> 00:06:07,440
mostly forgotten all of them
 

349
00:06:07,440 --> 00:06:10,790
mostly forgotten all of them
um are they uh so like 42

350
00:06:10,790 --> 00:06:10,800
um are they uh so like 42
 

351
00:06:10,800 --> 00:06:13,430
um are they uh so like 42
uh well yeah i mean that one 42 is

352
00:06:13,430 --> 00:06:13,440
uh well yeah i mean that one 42 is
 

353
00:06:13,440 --> 00:06:14,550
uh well yeah i mean that one 42 is
pretty magical

354
00:06:14,550 --> 00:06:14,560
pretty magical
 

355
00:06:14,560 --> 00:06:16,469
pretty magical
and then the irrationals i mean but is

356
00:06:16,469 --> 00:06:16,479
and then the irrationals i mean but is
 

357
00:06:16,479 --> 00:06:17,909
and then the irrationals i mean but is
there a square root or two

358
00:06:17,909 --> 00:06:17,919
there a square root or two
 

359
00:06:17,919 --> 00:06:21,350
there a square root or two
story in there somewhere well it's

360
00:06:21,350 --> 00:06:21,360
story in there somewhere well it's
 

361
00:06:21,360 --> 00:06:24,150
story in there somewhere well it's
it's like the only number that has

362
00:06:24,150 --> 00:06:24,160
it's like the only number that has
 

363
00:06:24,160 --> 00:06:26,550
it's like the only number that has
destroyed a religion

364
00:06:26,550 --> 00:06:26,560
destroyed a religion
 

365
00:06:26,560 --> 00:06:29,629
destroyed a religion
in which way well the the

366
00:06:29,629 --> 00:06:29,639
in which way well the the
 

367
00:06:29,639 --> 00:06:32,629
in which way well the the
pathagorians they they believed that all

368
00:06:32,629 --> 00:06:32,639
pathagorians they they believed that all
 

369
00:06:32,639 --> 00:06:34,950
pathagorians they they believed that all
numbers were perfect and you could

370
00:06:34,950 --> 00:06:34,960
numbers were perfect and you could
 

371
00:06:34,960 --> 00:06:38,550
numbers were perfect and you could
represent anything as as a as a rational

372
00:06:38,550 --> 00:06:38,560
represent anything as as a as a rational
 

373
00:06:38,560 --> 00:06:40,309
represent anything as as a as a rational
number

374
00:06:40,309 --> 00:06:40,319
number
 

375
00:06:40,319 --> 00:06:42,620
number
and

376
00:06:42,620 --> 00:06:42,630
and
 

377
00:06:42,630 --> 00:06:44,469
and
[Music]

378
00:06:44,469 --> 00:06:44,479
[Music]
 

379
00:06:44,479 --> 00:06:48,230
[Music]
in that in that time period

380
00:06:48,230 --> 00:06:48,240
in that in that time period
 

381
00:06:48,240 --> 00:06:51,430
in that in that time period
um the this proof came out

382
00:06:51,430 --> 00:06:51,440
um the this proof came out
 

383
00:06:51,440 --> 00:06:54,790
um the this proof came out
that there was no

384
00:06:54,790 --> 00:06:54,800
that there was no
 

385
00:06:54,800 --> 00:06:57,749
that there was no
you know rational fraction whose value

386
00:06:57,749 --> 00:06:57,759
you know rational fraction whose value
 

387
00:06:57,759 --> 00:07:00,790
you know rational fraction whose value
was equal to the square root of two

388
00:07:00,790 --> 00:07:00,800
was equal to the square root of two
 

389
00:07:00,800 --> 00:07:03,029
was equal to the square root of two
and that that means nothing in this

390
00:07:03,029 --> 00:07:03,039
and that that means nothing in this
 

391
00:07:03,039 --> 00:07:05,589
and that that means nothing in this
world is perfect not even mathematics

392
00:07:05,589 --> 00:07:05,599
world is perfect not even mathematics
 

393
00:07:05,599 --> 00:07:08,790
world is perfect not even mathematics
well it it means that your definition of

394
00:07:08,790 --> 00:07:08,800
well it it means that your definition of
 

395
00:07:08,800 --> 00:07:11,270
well it it means that your definition of
perfect was imperfect

396
00:07:11,270 --> 00:07:11,280
perfect was imperfect
 

397
00:07:11,280 --> 00:07:13,029
perfect was imperfect
well then then there's the ghetto and

398
00:07:13,029 --> 00:07:13,039
well then then there's the ghetto and
 

399
00:07:13,039 --> 00:07:14,629
well then then there's the ghetto and
completeness theorems in the 20th

400
00:07:14,629 --> 00:07:14,639
completeness theorems in the 20th
 

401
00:07:14,639 --> 00:07:16,390
completeness theorems in the 20th
century that ruined it once again

402
00:07:16,390 --> 00:07:16,400
century that ruined it once again
 

403
00:07:16,400 --> 00:07:19,189
century that ruined it once again

girdle's theorem um

408
00:07:24,309 --> 00:07:24,319

 

409
00:07:24,319 --> 00:07:25,990

you know the lesson i take from girdle's

410
00:07:25,990 --> 00:07:26,000
you know the lesson i take from girdle's
 

411
00:07:26,000 --> 00:07:28,390
you know the lesson i take from girdle's
theorem is not that

412
00:07:28,390 --> 00:07:28,400
theorem is not that
 

413
00:07:28,400 --> 00:07:30,469
theorem is not that
you know there are things you can't know

414
00:07:30,469 --> 00:07:30,479
you know there are things you can't know
 

415
00:07:30,479 --> 00:07:31,510
you know there are things you can't know
which

416
00:07:31,510 --> 00:07:31,520
which
 

417
00:07:31,520 --> 00:07:35,830
which
is fundamentally what it says um

418
00:07:35,830 --> 00:07:35,840
is fundamentally what it says um
 

419
00:07:35,840 --> 00:07:38,469
is fundamentally what it says um
but you know people want black and white

420
00:07:38,469 --> 00:07:38,479
but you know people want black and white
 

421
00:07:38,479 --> 00:07:39,189
but you know people want black and white
answers

422
00:07:39,189 --> 00:07:39,199
answers
 

423
00:07:39,199 --> 00:07:42,230
answers
they want true or false

424
00:07:42,230 --> 00:07:42,240
they want true or false
 

425
00:07:42,240 --> 00:07:46,550
they want true or false
um but if you if you allow a three-state

426
00:07:46,550 --> 00:07:46,560
um but if you if you allow a three-state
 

427
00:07:46,560 --> 00:07:47,990
um but if you if you allow a three-state
logic

428
00:07:47,990 --> 00:07:48,000
logic
 

429
00:07:48,000 --> 00:07:51,909
logic
that is true false or maybe

430
00:07:51,909 --> 00:07:51,919

 

431
00:07:51,919 --> 00:07:55,189

then then life's good

432
00:07:55,189 --> 00:07:55,199
then then life's good
 

433
00:07:55,199 --> 00:07:57,270
then then life's good
i feel like there's a parallel to uh

434
00:07:57,270 --> 00:07:57,280
i feel like there's a parallel to uh
 

435
00:07:57,280 --> 00:07:58,869
i feel like there's a parallel to uh
modern political discourse in there

436
00:07:58,869 --> 00:07:58,879
modern political discourse in there
 

437
00:07:58,879 --> 00:07:59,430
modern political discourse in there
somewhere

438
00:07:59,430 --> 00:07:59,440
somewhere
 

439
00:07:59,440 --> 00:08:02,550
somewhere
but yeah let me let me ask

440
00:08:02,550 --> 00:08:02,560
but yeah let me let me ask
 

441
00:08:02,560 --> 00:08:06,230
but yeah let me let me ask
um so with your kind of

442
00:08:06,230 --> 00:08:06,240
um so with your kind of
 

443
00:08:06,240 --> 00:08:10,469
um so with your kind of
early love or appreciation of the beauty

444
00:08:10,469 --> 00:08:10,479
early love or appreciation of the beauty
 

445
00:08:10,479 --> 00:08:11,510
early love or appreciation of the beauty
of mathematics

446
00:08:11,510 --> 00:08:11,520
of mathematics
 

447
00:08:11,520 --> 00:08:14,950
of mathematics
do you see a parallel between that world

448
00:08:14,950 --> 00:08:14,960
do you see a parallel between that world
 

449
00:08:14,960 --> 00:08:17,909
do you see a parallel between that world
and the world of programming you know

450
00:08:17,909 --> 00:08:17,919
and the world of programming you know
 

451
00:08:17,919 --> 00:08:19,990
and the world of programming you know
programming is

452
00:08:19,990 --> 00:08:20,000
programming is
 

453
00:08:20,000 --> 00:08:23,029
programming is
all about logical structure

454
00:08:23,029 --> 00:08:23,039
all about logical structure
 

455
00:08:23,039 --> 00:08:27,589
all about logical structure
understanding the the patterns

456
00:08:27,589 --> 00:08:27,599
understanding the the patterns
 

457
00:08:27,599 --> 00:08:30,710
understanding the the patterns
that um come out of

458
00:08:30,710 --> 00:08:30,720
that um come out of
 

459
00:08:30,720 --> 00:08:33,750
that um come out of
computation understanding

460
00:08:33,750 --> 00:08:33,760
computation understanding
 

461
00:08:33,760 --> 00:08:37,269
computation understanding
sort of i mean it's often

462
00:08:37,269 --> 00:08:37,279
sort of i mean it's often
 

463
00:08:37,279 --> 00:08:39,509
sort of i mean it's often
like you know the path through the graph

464
00:08:39,509 --> 00:08:39,519
like you know the path through the graph
 

465
00:08:39,519 --> 00:08:41,589
like you know the path through the graph
of possibilities

466
00:08:41,589 --> 00:08:41,599
of possibilities
 

467
00:08:41,599 --> 00:08:45,670
of possibilities
to find a short a short route

468
00:08:45,670 --> 00:08:45,680
to find a short a short route
 

469
00:08:45,680 --> 00:08:48,150
to find a short a short route
meaning like uh find a short program

470
00:08:48,150 --> 00:08:48,160
meaning like uh find a short program
 

471
00:08:48,160 --> 00:08:49,430
meaning like uh find a short program
that gets the job done

472
00:08:49,430 --> 00:08:49,440
that gets the job done
 

473
00:08:49,440 --> 00:08:52,310
that gets the job done
yeah kind of thing but uh so then on the

474
00:08:52,310 --> 00:08:52,320
yeah kind of thing but uh so then on the
 

475
00:08:52,320 --> 00:08:54,470
yeah kind of thing but uh so then on the
topic of irrational numbers

476
00:08:54,470 --> 00:08:54,480
topic of irrational numbers
 

477
00:08:54,480 --> 00:08:58,550
topic of irrational numbers
do you see dc programming

478
00:08:58,550 --> 00:08:58,560
do you see dc programming
 

479
00:08:58,560 --> 00:09:01,350
do you see dc programming
you just painted it so cleanly uh it's a

480
00:09:01,350 --> 00:09:01,360
you just painted it so cleanly uh it's a
 

481
00:09:01,360 --> 00:09:02,790
you just painted it so cleanly uh it's a
little this trajectory

482
00:09:02,790 --> 00:09:02,800
little this trajectory
 

483
00:09:02,800 --> 00:09:05,430
little this trajectory
to find like a nice little program but

484
00:09:05,430 --> 00:09:05,440
to find like a nice little program but
 

485
00:09:05,440 --> 00:09:08,790
to find like a nice little program but
do you see it as fundamentally messy

486
00:09:08,790 --> 00:09:08,800
do you see it as fundamentally messy
 

487
00:09:08,800 --> 00:09:11,590
do you see it as fundamentally messy
maybe unlike mathematics i don't think

488
00:09:11,590 --> 00:09:11,600
maybe unlike mathematics i don't think
 

489
00:09:11,600 --> 00:09:12,150
maybe unlike mathematics i don't think
of it as

490
00:09:12,150 --> 00:09:12,160
of it as
 

491
00:09:12,160 --> 00:09:14,150
of it as
i mean i mean you know you watch

492
00:09:14,150 --> 00:09:14,160
i mean i mean you know you watch
 

493
00:09:14,160 --> 00:09:16,070
i mean i mean you know you watch
somebody who's good at math do

494
00:09:16,070 --> 00:09:16,080
somebody who's good at math do
 

495
00:09:16,080 --> 00:09:19,670
somebody who's good at math do
math and you know often

496
00:09:19,670 --> 00:09:19,680
math and you know often
 

497
00:09:19,680 --> 00:09:23,350
math and you know often
it's it's fairly messy sometimes it's

498
00:09:23,350 --> 00:09:23,360
it's it's fairly messy sometimes it's
 

499
00:09:23,360 --> 00:09:24,150
it's it's fairly messy sometimes it's
kind of

500
00:09:24,150 --> 00:09:24,160
kind of
 

501
00:09:24,160 --> 00:09:27,590
kind of
magical um

502
00:09:27,590 --> 00:09:27,600
magical um
 

503

and if you were having a hard problem

518
00:09:50,949 --> 00:09:50,959
and if you were having a hard problem
 

519
00:09:50,959 --> 00:09:52,230
and if you were having a hard problem
with something you could just like

520
00:09:52,230 --> 00:09:52,240
with something you could just like
 

521
00:09:52,240 --> 00:09:54,150
with something you could just like
accost him in the hall

522
00:09:54,150 --> 00:09:54,160
accost him in the hall
 

523
00:09:54,160 --> 00:09:57,590
accost him in the hall
and say jim and

524
00:09:57,590 --> 00:09:57,600
and say jim and
 

525
00:09:57,600 --> 00:09:59,350
and say jim and
and he would do this this this funny

526
00:09:59,350 --> 00:09:59,360
and he would do this this this funny
 

527
00:09:59,360 --> 00:10:00,870
and he would do this this this funny
thing where he would

528
00:10:00,870 --> 00:10:00,880
thing where he would
 

529
00:10:00,880 --> 00:10:02,630
thing where he would
stand up straight his eyes would kind of

530
00:10:02,630 --> 00:10:02,640
stand up straight his eyes would kind of
 

531
00:10:02,640 --> 00:10:04,310
stand up straight his eyes would kind of
defocus he'd

532
00:10:04,310 --> 00:10:04,320
defocus he'd
 

533
00:10:04,320 --> 00:10:06,550
defocus he'd
go uh you know just just like get you

534
00:10:06,550 --> 00:10:06,560
go uh you know just just like get you
 

535
00:10:06,560 --> 00:10:07,509
go uh you know just just like get you
know like like

536
00:10:07,509 --> 00:10:07,519
know like like
 

537
00:10:07,519 --> 00:10:10,710
know like like
something in today's movies

538
00:10:10,710 --> 00:10:10,720

 

539
00:10:10,720 --> 00:10:12,150

and then you straighten up and say and

540
00:10:12,150 --> 00:10:12,160
and then you straighten up and say and
 

541
00:10:12,160 --> 00:10:15,750
and then you straighten up and say and
log in and walk away

542
00:10:15,750 --> 00:10:15,760

 

543
00:10:15,760 --> 00:10:19,590

and and and you go well okay so n log n

544
00:10:19,590 --> 00:10:19,600
and and and you go well okay so n log n
 

545
00:10:19,600 --> 00:10:21,030
and and and you go well okay so n log n
is the answer how did he

546
00:10:21,030 --> 00:10:21,040
is the answer how did he
 

547
00:10:21,040 --> 00:10:24,069
is the answer how did he
get there

548
00:10:24,069 --> 00:10:24,079

 

549
00:10:24,079 --> 00:10:25,829

by which time he's you know down the

550
00:10:25,829 --> 00:10:25,839
by which time he's you know down the
 

551
00:10:25,839 --> 00:10:27,590
by which time he's you know down the
hallway somewhere yeah

552
00:10:27,590 --> 00:10:27,600
hallway somewhere yeah
 

553
00:10:27,600 --> 00:10:30,069
hallway somewhere yeah
it is just the the oracle the black box

554
00:10:30,069 --> 00:10:30,079
it is just the the oracle the black box
 

555
00:10:30,079 --> 00:10:31,269
it is just the the oracle the black box
just gives you the answer

556
00:10:31,269 --> 00:10:31,279
just gives you the answer
 

557
00:10:31,279 --> 00:10:32,870
just gives you the answer
yeah and then you have to figure out the

558
00:10:32,870 --> 00:10:32,880
yeah and then you have to figure out the
 

559
00:10:32,880 --> 00:10:36,230
yeah and then you have to figure out the
path from the question to the answer

560
00:10:36,230 --> 00:10:36,240
path from the question to the answer
 

561
00:10:36,240 --> 00:10:37,990
path from the question to the answer
i think in one of the videos i watched

562
00:10:37,990 --> 00:10:38,000
i think in one of the videos i watched
 

563
00:10:38,000 --> 00:10:39,350
i think in one of the videos i watched
you mentioned

564
00:10:39,350 --> 00:10:39,360
you mentioned
 

565
00:10:39,360 --> 00:10:42,550
you mentioned
uh don knuth uh well

566
00:10:42,550 --> 00:10:42,560
uh don knuth uh well
 

567
00:10:42,560 --> 00:10:45,030
uh don knuth uh well
at least recommending his uh you know

568
00:10:45,030 --> 00:10:45,040
at least recommending his uh you know
 

569
00:10:45,040 --> 00:10:45,990
at least recommending his uh you know
his his book

570
00:10:45,990 --> 00:10:46,000
his his book
 

571
00:10:46,000 --> 00:10:48,230
his his book
is something people should read oh yeah

572
00:10:48,230 --> 00:10:48,240
is something people should read oh yeah
 

573
00:10:48,240 --> 00:10:50,069
is something people should read oh yeah
but in terms of

574
00:10:50,069 --> 00:10:50,079
but in terms of
 

575
00:10:50,079 --> 00:10:53,829
but in terms of
you know theoretical computer science

576
00:10:53,829 --> 00:10:53,839
you know theoretical computer science
 

577
00:10:53,839 --> 00:10:56,790
you know theoretical computer science
do you do you see something beautiful in

578
00:10:56,790 --> 00:10:56,800
do you do you see something beautiful in
 

579
00:10:56,800 --> 00:10:57,110
do you do you see something beautiful in
in

580
00:10:57,110 --> 00:10:57,120
in
 

581
00:10:57,120 --> 00:10:59,190
in
that has been inspiring to you speaking

582
00:10:59,190 --> 00:10:59,200
that has been inspiring to you speaking
 

583
00:10:59,200 --> 00:11:00,710
that has been inspiring to you speaking
of n log n

584
00:11:00,710 --> 00:11:00,720
of n log n
 

585
00:11:00,720 --> 00:11:03,829
of n log n
in your work on programming languages

586
00:11:03,829 --> 00:11:03,839
in your work on programming languages
 

587
00:11:03,839 --> 00:11:06,710
in your work on programming languages
that's in the in that whole world of

588
00:11:06,710 --> 00:11:06,720
that's in the in that whole world of
 

589
00:11:06,720 --> 00:11:08,630
that's in the in that whole world of
algorithms and complexity

590

algorithms and complexity
 

591
00:11:08,640 --> 00:11:11,509
algorithms and complexity
and you know these kinds of more formal

592
00:11:11,509 --> 00:11:11,519
and you know these kinds of more formal
 

593
00:11:11,519 --> 00:11:12,630
and you know these kinds of more formal
mathematical things

594
00:11:12,630 --> 00:11:12,640
mathematical things
 

595
00:11:12,640 --> 00:11:15,670
mathematical things
um or did that not really

596
00:11:15,670 --> 00:11:15,680
um or did that not really
 

597
00:11:15,680 --> 00:11:20,150
um or did that not really
stick with you in your programming life

598
00:11:20,150 --> 00:11:20,160
stick with you in your programming life
 

599
00:11:20,160 --> 00:11:23,990
stick with you in your programming life
it did stick pretty clearly for me

600
00:11:23,990 --> 00:11:24,000
it did stick pretty clearly for me
 

601
00:11:24,000 --> 00:11:25,590
it did stick pretty clearly for me
because

602
00:11:25,590 --> 00:11:25,600
because
 

603
00:11:25,600 --> 00:11:27,110
because
one of the things that i care about is

604
00:11:27,110 --> 00:11:27,120
one of the things that i care about is
 

605
00:11:27,120 --> 00:11:32,150
one of the things that i care about is
being able to

606
00:11:32,150 --> 00:11:32,160

 

607
00:11:32,160 --> 00:11:35,829

sort of look at a piece of code and and

608
00:11:35,829 --> 00:11:35,839
sort of look at a piece of code and and
 

609
00:11:35,839 --> 00:11:40,150
sort of look at a piece of code and and
be able to prove to myself that it works

610
00:11:40,150 --> 00:11:40,160
be able to prove to myself that it works
 

611
00:11:40,160 --> 00:11:43,670
be able to prove to myself that it works
um you know and

612
00:11:43,670 --> 00:11:43,680
um you know and
 

613
00:11:43,680 --> 00:11:46,310
um you know and
you know so so for example i find that

614
00:11:46,310 --> 00:11:46,320
you know so so for example i find that
 

615
00:11:46,320 --> 00:11:48,069
you know so so for example i find that
um

616
00:11:48,069 --> 00:11:48,079
um
 

617
00:11:48,079 --> 00:11:52,550
um
i'm i'm at odds with many of the people

618
00:11:52,550 --> 00:11:52,560
i'm i'm at odds with many of the people
 

619
00:11:52,560 --> 00:11:54,069
i'm i'm at odds with many of the people
around me

620
00:11:54,069 --> 00:11:54,079
around me
 

621
00:11:54,079 --> 00:11:58,310
around me
over um issues about like

622
00:11:58,310 --> 00:11:58,320
over um issues about like
 

623
00:11:58,320 --> 00:12:02,870
over um issues about like
how you lay out a piece of software

624
00:12:02,870 --> 00:12:02,880
how you lay out a piece of software
 

625
00:12:02,880 --> 00:12:06,389
how you lay out a piece of software
right you know so so software engineers

626
00:12:06,389 --> 00:12:06,399
right you know so so software engineers
 

627
00:12:06,399 --> 00:12:07,590
right you know so so software engineers
get really cranky

628
00:12:07,590 --> 00:12:07,600
get really cranky
 

629
00:12:07,600 --> 00:12:09,590
get really cranky
about how they format their the

630
00:12:09,590 --> 00:12:09,600
about how they format their the
 

631
00:12:09,600 --> 00:12:11,910
about how they format their the
documents that are the programs you know

632
00:12:11,910 --> 00:12:11,920
documents that are the programs you know
 

633
00:12:11,920 --> 00:12:13,670
documents that are the programs you know
where they put new lines and where they

634
00:12:13,670 --> 00:12:13,680
where they put new lines and where they
 

635
00:12:13,680 --> 00:12:15,590
where they put new lines and where they
put you know the braces

636
00:12:15,590 --> 00:12:15,600
put you know the braces
 

637
00:12:15,600 --> 00:12:17,430
put you know the braces
the braces and all the rest of that

638
00:12:17,430 --> 00:12:17,440
the braces and all the rest of that
 

639
00:12:17,440 --> 00:12:18,629
the braces and all the rest of that
right

640
00:12:18,629 --> 00:12:18,639
right
 

641
00:12:18,639 --> 00:12:21,670
right
and i tend to go

642
00:12:21,670 --> 00:12:21,680
and i tend to go
 

643
00:12:21,680 --> 00:12:27,350
and i tend to go
for a style that's very dense

644
00:12:27,350 --> 00:12:27,360

 

645
00:12:27,360 --> 00:12:31,430

to minimize the white space um yeah well

646
00:12:31,430 --> 00:12:31,440
to minimize the white space um yeah well
 

647
00:12:31,440 --> 00:12:35,590
to minimize the white space um yeah well
to maximize the amount that i can see

648
00:12:35,590 --> 00:12:35,600
to maximize the amount that i can see
 

649
00:12:35,600 --> 00:12:38,629
to maximize the amount that i can see
at once right so i like to be able to

650
00:12:38,629 --> 00:12:38,639
at once right so i like to be able to
 

651
00:12:38,639 --> 00:12:39,030
at once right so i like to be able to
see

652
00:12:39,030 --> 00:12:39,040
see
 

653
00:12:39,040 --> 00:12:41,750
see
a whole function and to understand what

654
00:12:41,750 --> 00:12:41,760
a whole function and to understand what
 

655
00:12:41,760 --> 00:12:42,870
a whole function and to understand what
it does

656
00:12:42,870 --> 00:12:42,880
it does
 

657
00:12:42,880 --> 00:12:44,310
it does
rather than have to go scroll scroll

658
00:12:44,310 --> 00:12:44,320
rather than have to go scroll scroll
 

659
00:12:44,320 --> 00:12:46,470
rather than have to go scroll scroll
scroll and remember right yeah

660
00:12:46,470 --> 00:12:46,480
scroll and remember right yeah
 

661
00:12:46,480 --> 00:12:48,870
scroll and remember right yeah
i'm with you on that yeah that's and

662
00:12:48,870 --> 00:12:48,880
i'm with you on that yeah that's and
 

663
00:12:48,880 --> 00:12:52,790
i'm with you on that yeah that's and
people don't like that

664
00:12:52,790 --> 00:12:52,800
people don't like that
 

665
00:12:52,800 --> 00:12:55,670
people don't like that
yeah i've i've had i've had you know

00:13:00,949 --> 00:13:00,959
engineering teams have uh staged
 

671
00:13:00,959 --> 00:13:06,629
engineering teams have uh staged
what was effectively an intervention

672
00:13:06,629 --> 00:13:06,639
what was effectively an intervention
 

673
00:13:06,639 --> 00:13:09,509
what was effectively an intervention
um you know where they they invite me to

674
00:13:09,509 --> 00:13:09,519
um you know where they they invite me to
 

675
00:13:09,519 --> 00:13:11,670
um you know where they they invite me to
a meeting and everybody's arrived before

676
00:13:11,670 --> 00:13:11,680
a meeting and everybody's arrived before
 

677
00:13:11,680 --> 00:13:14,550
a meeting and everybody's arrived before
me and they so all look at me and say

678
00:13:14,550 --> 00:13:14,560
me and they so all look at me and say
 

679
00:13:14,560 --> 00:13:20,870
me and they so all look at me and say
james about your coding style

680
00:13:20,870 --> 00:13:20,880
james about your coding style
 

681
00:13:20,880 --> 00:13:23,910
james about your coding style
i'm sort of an odd person to be

682
00:13:23,910 --> 00:13:23,920
i'm sort of an odd person to be
 

683
00:13:23,920 --> 00:13:27,750
i'm sort of an odd person to be
programming because i don't think

684
00:13:27,750 --> 00:13:27,760
programming because i don't think
 

685
00:13:27,760 --> 00:13:31,509
programming because i don't think
very well verbally um

686
00:13:31,509 --> 00:13:31,519
very well verbally um
 

687
00:13:31,519 --> 00:13:36,790
very well verbally um
i am just naturally a slow reader

688
00:13:36,790 --> 00:13:36,800
i am just naturally a slow reader
 

689
00:13:36,800 --> 00:13:39,829
i am just naturally a slow reader
um i'm what most people would call

690
00:13:39,829 --> 00:13:39,839
um i'm what most people would call
 

691
00:13:39,839 --> 00:13:42,790
um i'm what most people would call
a visual thinker so when you think about

692
00:13:42,790 --> 00:13:42,800
a visual thinker so when you think about
 

693
00:13:42,800 --> 00:13:43,990
a visual thinker so when you think about
a program what do you

694
00:13:43,990 --> 00:13:44,000
a program what do you
 

695
00:13:44,000 --> 00:13:48,310
a program what do you
what do you see i see pictures right so

696
00:13:48,310 --> 00:13:48,320
what do you see i see pictures right so
 

697
00:13:48,320 --> 00:13:50,550
what do you see i see pictures right so
when i look at a piece of code on a

698
00:13:50,550 --> 00:13:50,560
when i look at a piece of code on a
 

699
00:13:50,560 --> 00:13:52,069
when i look at a piece of code on a
piece of paper

700
00:13:52,069 --> 00:13:52,079
piece of paper
 

701
00:13:52,079 --> 00:13:55,030
piece of paper
it very quickly gets transformed into a

702
00:13:55,030 --> 00:13:55,040
it very quickly gets transformed into a
 

703
00:13:55,040 --> 00:13:57,350
it very quickly gets transformed into a
picture

704
00:13:57,350 --> 00:13:57,360
picture
 

705
00:13:57,360 --> 00:14:00,870
picture
um and you know it's almost like a piece

706
00:14:00,870 --> 00:14:00,880
um and you know it's almost like a piece
 

707
00:14:00,880 --> 00:14:03,110
um and you know it's almost like a piece
of machinery with

708
00:14:03,110 --> 00:14:03,120
of machinery with
 

709
00:14:03,120 --> 00:14:05,590
of machinery with
you know this connected to that and like

710
00:14:05,590 --> 00:14:05,600
you know this connected to that and like
 

711
00:14:05,600 --> 00:14:06,310
you know this connected to that and like
these gear

712
00:14:06,310 --> 00:14:06,320
these gear
 

713
00:14:06,320 --> 00:14:10,310
these gear
knobs yeah yeah i i see them more

714
00:14:10,310 --> 00:14:10,320
knobs yeah yeah i i see them more
 

715
00:14:10,320 --> 00:14:13,750
knobs yeah yeah i i see them more
more like that than i see the the

716
00:14:13,750 --> 00:14:13,760
more like that than i see the the
 

717
00:14:13,760 --> 00:14:16,150
more like that than i see the the
the sort of verbal structure or the

718
00:14:16,150 --> 00:14:16,160
the sort of verbal structure or the
 

719
00:14:16,160 --> 00:14:17,590
the sort of verbal structure or the
lexical structure of

720
00:14:17,590 --> 00:14:17,600
lexical structure of
 

721
00:14:17,600 --> 00:14:19,430
lexical structure of
of letters so then when you look at the

722
00:14:19,430 --> 00:14:19,440
of letters so then when you look at the
 

723
00:14:19,440 --> 00:14:20,790
of letters so then when you look at the
program that's why you want to see it

724
00:14:20,790 --> 00:14:20,800
program that's why you want to see it
 

725
00:14:20,800 --> 00:14:22,230
program that's why you want to see it
all in the same place then you could

726
00:14:22,230 --> 00:14:22,240
all in the same place then you could
 

727
00:14:22,240 --> 00:14:22,790
all in the same place then you could
just map

728
00:14:22,790 --> 00:14:22,800
just map
 

729
00:14:22,800 --> 00:14:24,790
just map
it to something visual yeah and just

730
00:14:24,790 --> 00:14:24,800
it to something visual yeah and just
 

731
00:14:24,800 --> 00:14:27,110
it to something visual yeah and just
kind of like like it leaps off the page

732
00:14:27,110 --> 00:14:27,120
kind of like like it leaps off the page
 

733
00:14:27,120 --> 00:14:28,150
kind of like like it leaps off the page
at me and

734
00:14:28,150 --> 00:14:28,160
at me and
 

735
00:14:28,160 --> 00:14:30,069
at me and
yeah what are the inputs where the

736
00:14:30,069 --> 00:14:30,079
yeah what are the inputs where the
 

737
00:14:30,079 --> 00:14:31,670
yeah what are the inputs where the
outputs what the heck is this thing

738
00:14:31,670 --> 00:14:31,680
outputs what the heck is this thing
 

739
00:14:31,680 --> 00:14:32,870
outputs what the heck is this thing
doing yeah

740
00:14:32,870 --> 00:14:32,880
doing yeah
 

741
00:14:32,880 --> 00:14:35,590
doing yeah
and yeah getting a whole vision of it

742
00:14:35,590 --> 00:14:35,600
and yeah getting a whole vision of it
 

743
00:14:35,600 --> 00:14:37,110
and yeah getting a whole vision of it
can we uh

744
00:14:37,110 --> 00:14:37,120
can we uh
 

745
00:14:37,120 --> 00:14:40,230
can we uh
go back into your memory memory

746
00:14:40,230 --> 00:14:40,240
go back into your memory memory
 

747
00:14:40,240 --> 00:14:43,189
go back into your memory memory
long-term memory access what's the first

748
00:14:43,189 --> 00:14:43,199
long-term memory access what's the first
 

749
00:14:43,199 --> 00:14:43,829
long-term memory access what's the first
program

750
00:14:43,829 --> 00:14:43,839
program
 

751
00:14:43,839 --> 00:14:47,350
program
you've ever written

752
00:14:47,350 --> 00:14:47,360

 

753
00:14:47,360 --> 00:14:51,990

oh i have no idea what the first one was

754
00:14:51,990 --> 00:14:52,000
oh i have no idea what the first one was
 

755
00:14:52,000 --> 00:14:55,350
oh i have no idea what the first one was
i mean i i know the first machine that i

756
00:14:55,350 --> 00:14:55,360
i mean i i know the first machine that i
 

757
00:14:55,360 --> 00:14:58,310
i mean i i know the first machine that i
learned that i learned to program on

758
00:14:58,310 --> 00:14:58,320
learned that i learned to program on
 

759
00:14:58,320 --> 00:14:59,750
learned that i learned to program on
what is it was a

760
00:14:59,750 --> 00:14:59,760
what is it was a
 

761
00:14:59,760 --> 00:15:02,870
what is it was a
pdp-8

762
00:15:02,870 --> 00:15:02,880

 

763
00:15:02,880 --> 00:15:06,310

um at the university of calgary

764
00:15:06,310 --> 00:15:06,320
um at the university of calgary
 

765
00:15:06,320 --> 00:15:09,590
um at the university of calgary
do you remember the specs oh yeah so

766
00:15:09,590 --> 00:15:09,600
do you remember the specs oh yeah so
 

767
00:15:09,600 --> 00:15:12,629
do you remember the specs oh yeah so
so the thing had 4k of ram

768
00:15:12,629 --> 00:15:12,639
so the thing had 4k of ram
 

769
00:15:12,639 --> 00:15:16,389
so the thing had 4k of ram
nice 12-bit words

770
00:15:16,389 --> 00:15:16,399
nice 12-bit words
 

771
00:15:16,399 --> 00:15:21,430
nice 12-bit words
the clock rate was um

772
00:15:21,430 --> 00:15:21,440
the clock rate was um
 

773
00:15:21,440 --> 00:15:26,389
the clock rate was um
it was about a third of a megahertz

774
00:15:26,389 --> 00:15:26,399
it was about a third of a megahertz
 

775
00:15:26,399 --> 00:15:28,710
it was about a third of a megahertz
oh so i didn't even get to the to the m

776
00:15:28,710 --> 00:15:28,720
oh so i didn't even get to the to the m
 

777
00:15:28,720 --> 00:15:30,230
oh so i didn't even get to the to the m
okay yeah

778
00:15:30,230 --> 00:15:30,240
okay yeah
 

779
00:15:30,240 --> 00:15:33,590
okay yeah
yeah so you know we're we're like

780
00:15:33,590 --> 00:15:33,600
yeah so you know we're we're like
 

781
00:15:33,600 --> 00:15:37,430
yeah so you know we're we're like
10 000 times faster these days

782
00:15:37,430 --> 00:15:37,440
10 000 times faster these days
 

783
00:15:37,440 --> 00:15:40,069
10 000 times faster these days
um and was this kind of like a super

784
00:15:40,069 --> 00:15:40,079
um and was this kind of like a super
 

785
00:15:40,079 --> 00:15:41,829
um and was this kind of like a super
computer like a serious computer

786
00:15:41,829 --> 00:15:41,839
computer like a serious computer
 

787
00:15:41,839 --> 00:15:45,269
computer like a serious computer
for no the pdp 8i was the

788
00:15:45,269 --> 00:15:45,279
for no the pdp 8i was the
 

789
00:15:45,279 --> 00:15:47,749
for no the pdp 8i was the
the first thing that people were calling

790
00:15:47,749 --> 00:15:47,759
the first thing that people were calling
 

791
00:15:47,759 --> 00:15:49,590
the first thing that people were calling
like mini computer

792
00:15:49,590 --> 00:15:49,600
like mini computer
 

793
00:15:49,600 --> 00:15:52,710
like mini computer
got it they were sort of inexpensive

794
00:15:52,710 --> 00:15:52,720
got it they were sort of inexpensive
 

795
00:15:52,720 --> 00:15:53,509
got it they were sort of inexpensive
enough

796
00:15:53,509 --> 00:15:53,519
enough
 

797
00:15:53,519 --> 00:15:56,710
enough
that a university lab could maybe afford

798
00:15:56,710 --> 00:15:56,720
that a university lab could maybe afford
 

799
00:15:56,720 --> 00:15:59,189
that a university lab could maybe afford
to buy one

800
00:15:59,189 --> 00:15:59,199
to buy one
 

801
00:15:59,199 --> 00:16:01,030
to buy one
and was there time sharing all that kind

802
00:16:01,030 --> 00:16:01,040
and was there time sharing all that kind
 

803
00:16:01,040 --> 00:16:03,430
and was there time sharing all that kind
of stuff um there there actually was a

804
00:16:03,430 --> 00:16:03,440
of stuff um there there actually was a
 

805
00:16:03,440 --> 00:16:04,629
of stuff um there there actually was a
time sharing os

806
00:16:04,629 --> 00:16:04,639
time sharing os
 

807
00:16:04,639 --> 00:16:08,069
time sharing os
for that but it wasn't

808
00:16:08,069 --> 00:16:08,079
for that but it wasn't
 

809
00:16:08,079 --> 00:16:11,430
for that but it wasn't
used really widely the machine that i

810
00:16:11,430 --> 00:16:11,440
used really widely the machine that i
 

811
00:16:11,440 --> 00:16:12,230
used really widely the machine that i
learned on

812
00:16:12,230 --> 00:16:12,240
learned on
 

813
00:16:12,240 --> 00:16:15,430
learned on
was one that was kind of hidden in the

814
00:16:15,430 --> 00:16:15,440
was one that was kind of hidden in the
 

815
00:16:15,440 --> 00:16:17,430
was one that was kind of hidden in the
back corner

816
00:16:17,430 --> 00:16:17,440
back corner
 

817
00:16:17,440 --> 00:16:21,189
back corner
of the of the computer center

818
00:16:21,189 --> 00:16:21,199
of the of the computer center
 

819
00:16:21,199 --> 00:16:24,629
of the of the computer center
um and it was

820
00:16:24,629 --> 00:16:24,639
um and it was
 

821
00:16:24,639 --> 00:16:28,629
um and it was
it was bought as a as part of a

822
00:16:28,629 --> 00:16:28,639
it was bought as a as part of a
 

823
00:16:28,639 --> 00:16:33,269
it was bought as a as part of a
um project to do computer networking

824
00:16:33,269 --> 00:16:33,279
um project to do computer networking
 

825
00:16:33,279 --> 00:16:36,710
um project to do computer networking
um but

826
00:16:36,710 --> 00:16:36,720
um but
 

827
00:16:36,720 --> 00:16:38,150
um but
you know they didn't actually use it

828
00:16:38,150 --> 00:16:38,160
you know they didn't actually use it
 

829
00:16:38,160 --> 00:16:39,749
you know they didn't actually use it
very much it was mostly just kind of

830
00:16:39,749 --> 00:16:39,759
very much it was mostly just kind of
 

831
00:16:39,759 --> 00:16:42,150
very much it was mostly just kind of
sitting there

832
00:16:42,150 --> 00:16:42,160
sitting there
 

833
00:16:42,160 --> 00:16:45,030
sitting there
and it was kind of sitting there and i

834
00:16:45,030 --> 00:16:45,040
and it was kind of sitting there and i
 

835
00:16:45,040 --> 00:16:46,550
and it was kind of sitting there and i
noticed it was just kind of sitting

836
00:16:46,550 --> 00:16:46,560
noticed it was just kind of sitting
 

837
00:16:46,560 --> 00:16:47,670
noticed it was just kind of sitting
there and

838
00:16:47,670 --> 00:16:47,680
there and
 

839
00:16:47,680 --> 00:16:51,509
there and
so i started fooling around with it and

840
00:16:51,509 --> 00:16:51,519
so i started fooling around with it and
 

841
00:16:51,519 --> 00:16:54,069
so i started fooling around with it and
nobody seemed to mind so i just kept

842
00:16:54,069 --> 00:16:54,079
nobody seemed to mind so i just kept
 

843
00:16:54,079 --> 00:16:55,829
nobody seemed to mind so i just kept
doing that and

844
00:16:55,829 --> 00:16:55,839
doing that and
 

845
00:16:55,839 --> 00:16:58,870
doing that and
i had a keyboard and like a monitor

846
00:16:58,870 --> 00:16:58,880
i had a keyboard and like a monitor
 

847
00:16:58,880 --> 00:17:01,269
i had a keyboard and like a monitor
oh this is way before monitors were

848
00:17:01,269 --> 00:17:01,279
oh this is way before monitors were
 

849
00:17:01,279 --> 00:17:02,470
oh this is way before monitors were
common

850
00:17:02,470 --> 00:17:02,480
common
 

851
00:17:02,480 --> 00:17:05,750
common
so it was it was literally a a model 33

852
00:17:05,750 --> 00:17:05,760
so it was it was literally a a model 33
 

853
00:17:05,760 --> 00:17:07,270
so it was it was literally a a model 33
teletype

854
00:17:07,270 --> 00:17:07,280
teletype
 

855
00:17:07,280 --> 00:17:11,909
teletype
okay with a paper tape reader

856
00:17:11,909 --> 00:17:11,919

 

857
00:17:11,919 --> 00:17:13,750

okay so the user interface wasn't very

858
00:17:13,750 --> 00:17:13,760
okay so the user interface wasn't very
 

859
00:17:13,760 --> 00:17:15,189
okay so the user interface wasn't very
good yeah

860
00:17:15,189 --> 00:17:15,199
good yeah
 

861
00:17:15,199 --> 00:17:18,470
good yeah
yeah it was it was the first computer

862
00:17:18,470 --> 00:17:18,480
yeah it was it was the first computer
 

863
00:17:18,480 --> 00:17:19,029
yeah it was it was the first computer
ever

864
00:17:19,029 --> 00:17:19,039
ever
 

865
00:17:19,039 --> 00:17:23,110
ever
built with integrated circuits

866
00:17:23,110 --> 00:17:23,120
built with integrated circuits
 

867
00:17:23,120 --> 00:17:25,429
built with integrated circuits
but by integrated circuits i mean that

868
00:17:25,429 --> 00:17:25,439
but by integrated circuits i mean that
 

869
00:17:25,439 --> 00:17:26,309
but by integrated circuits i mean that
they would have

870
00:17:26,309 --> 00:17:26,319
they would have
 

871
00:17:26,319 --> 00:17:29,510
they would have
like 10 or 12 transistors

872
00:17:29,510 --> 00:17:29,520
like 10 or 12 transistors
 

873
00:17:29,520 --> 00:17:32,710
like 10 or 12 transistors
on one piece of silicon right not the 10

874
00:17:32,710 --> 00:17:32,720
on one piece of silicon right not the 10

or 12

876
00:17:33,909 --> 00:17:33,919
or 12

00:17:38,630 --> 00:17:38,640
billion that machines have today
 

879
00:17:38,640 --> 00:17:41,750
billion that machines have today
so what did that i mean feel like if you

880
00:17:41,750 --> 00:17:41,760
so what did that i mean feel like if you
 

881
00:17:41,760 --> 00:17:43,590
so what did that i mean feel like if you
remember those

882
00:17:43,590 --> 00:17:43,600
remember those
 

883
00:17:43,600 --> 00:17:46,950
remember those
i mean did you have kind of inklings of

884
00:17:46,950 --> 00:17:46,960
i mean did you have kind of inklings of
 

885
00:17:46,960 --> 00:17:47,909
i mean did you have kind of inklings of
the

886
00:17:47,909 --> 00:17:47,919
the
 

887
00:17:47,919 --> 00:17:50,789
the
the magic of exponential kind of

888
00:17:50,789 --> 00:17:50,799
the magic of exponential kind of

892
00:17:55,350 --> 00:17:55,360
of the potential of the future that was
 

893
00:17:55,360 --> 00:17:57,190
of the potential of the future that was
at your fingertips kind of thing oh it

894
00:17:57,190 --> 00:17:57,200
at your fingertips kind of thing oh it
 

895
00:17:57,200 --> 00:17:57,430
at your fingertips kind of thing oh it
was

896
00:17:57,430 --> 00:17:57,440
was
 

897
00:17:57,440 --> 00:18:00,710
was
just a cool yeah it was just a toy

898
00:18:00,710 --> 00:18:00,720
just a cool yeah it was just a toy
 

899
00:18:00,720 --> 00:18:02,390
just a cool yeah it was just a toy
you know i had always liked building

900
00:18:02,390 --> 00:18:02,400
you know i had always liked building
 

901
00:18:02,400 --> 00:18:03,990
you know i had always liked building
stuff

902
00:18:03,990 --> 00:18:04,000
stuff
 

903
00:18:04,000 --> 00:18:06,230
stuff
but one of the problems with building

904
00:18:06,230 --> 00:18:06,240
but one of the problems with building
 

905
00:18:06,240 --> 00:18:08,150
but one of the problems with building
stuff is that you need to have

906
00:18:08,150 --> 00:18:08,160
stuff is that you need to have
 

907
00:18:08,160 --> 00:18:10,789
stuff is that you need to have
parts you know you need to have pieces

908
00:18:10,789 --> 00:18:10,799
parts you know you need to have pieces
 

909
00:18:10,799 --> 00:18:12,070
parts you know you need to have pieces
of wood or wire

910
00:18:12,070 --> 00:18:12,080
of wood or wire
 

911
00:18:12,080 --> 00:18:15,190
of wood or wire
or switches or stuff like that and those

912
00:18:15,190 --> 00:18:15,200
or switches or stuff like that and those
 

913
00:18:15,200 --> 00:18:16,710
or switches or stuff like that and those
all cost money

914
00:18:16,710 --> 00:18:16,720
all cost money
 

915
00:18:16,720 --> 00:18:18,630
all cost money
and here you could build you could build

916
00:18:18,630 --> 00:18:18,640
and here you could build you could build
 

917
00:18:18,640 --> 00:18:20,549
and here you could build you could build
arbitrarily complicated things

918
00:18:20,549 --> 00:18:20,559
arbitrarily complicated things
 

919
00:18:20,559 --> 00:18:24,230
arbitrarily complicated things
and i didn't need any physical materials

920
00:18:24,230 --> 00:18:24,240
and i didn't need any physical materials
 

921
00:18:24,240 --> 00:18:27,430
and i didn't need any physical materials
um it required no money that's right

922
00:18:27,430 --> 00:18:27,440
um it required no money that's right
 

923
00:18:27,440 --> 00:18:28,310
um it required no money that's right
it's a good way to put

924
00:18:28,310 --> 00:18:28,320
it's a good way to put
 

925
00:18:28,320 --> 00:18:31,190
it's a good way to put
programming you're right it's uh if you

926
00:18:31,190 --> 00:18:31,200
programming you're right it's uh if you
 

927
00:18:31,200 --> 00:18:32,789
programming you're right it's uh if you
love building things

928
00:18:32,789 --> 00:18:32,799
love building things
 

929
00:18:32,799 --> 00:18:36,230
love building things
it uh okay so it you know completely

930
00:18:36,230 --> 00:18:36,240
it uh okay so it you know completely
 

931
00:18:36,240 --> 00:18:37,110
it uh okay so it you know completely
accessible

932
00:18:37,110 --> 00:18:37,120
accessible
 

933
00:18:37,120 --> 00:18:39,510
accessible
you don't need anything and anybody from

934
00:18:39,510 --> 00:18:39,520
you don't need anything and anybody from
 

935
00:18:39,520 --> 00:18:40,870
you don't need anything and anybody from
anywhere could just build something

936
00:18:40,870 --> 00:18:40,880
anywhere could just build something
 

937
00:18:40,880 --> 00:18:41,510
anywhere could just build something
really cool

938
00:18:41,510 --> 00:18:41,520
really cool
 

939
00:18:41,520 --> 00:18:44,150
really cool
yeah yeah if you've got access to a

940
00:18:44,150 --> 00:18:44,160
yeah yeah if you've got access to a
 

941
00:18:44,160 --> 00:18:45,350
yeah yeah if you've got access to a
computer you can

942
00:18:45,350 --> 00:18:45,360
computer you can
 

943
00:18:45,360 --> 00:18:49,990
computer you can
you can build all kinds of crazy stuff

944
00:18:49,990 --> 00:18:50,000
you can build all kinds of crazy stuff
 

945
00:18:50,000 --> 00:18:53,830
you can build all kinds of crazy stuff
um and

946
00:18:53,830 --> 00:18:53,840

 

947
00:18:53,840 --> 00:18:57,830

you know and when you were somebody like

948
00:18:57,830 --> 00:18:57,840
you know and when you were somebody like
 

949
00:18:57,840 --> 00:19:02,150
you know and when you were somebody like
me who had like really no money

950
00:19:02,150 --> 00:19:02,160
me who had like really no money
 

951
00:19:02,160 --> 00:19:05,510
me who had like really no money
um and i mean i

952
00:19:05,510 --> 00:19:05,520
um and i mean i
 

953
00:19:05,520 --> 00:19:08,150
um and i mean i
i remember just lusting after being able

954
00:19:08,150 --> 00:19:08,160
i remember just lusting after being able
 

955
00:19:08,160 --> 00:19:09,270
i remember just lusting after being able
to buy like

956
00:19:09,270 --> 00:19:09,280
to buy like
 

957
00:19:09,280 --> 00:19:14,390
to buy like
a transistor

958
00:19:14,390 --> 00:19:14,400

 

959
00:19:14,400 --> 00:19:17,990

um you know and when i would do

960
00:19:17,990 --> 00:19:18,000
um you know and when i would do
 

961
00:19:18,000 --> 00:19:20,150
um you know and when i would do
sort of electronics kind of projects

962
00:19:20,150 --> 00:19:20,160
sort of electronics kind of projects
 

963
00:19:20,160 --> 00:19:22,230
sort of electronics kind of projects
they were mostly made

964
00:19:22,230 --> 00:19:22,240
they were mostly made
 

965
00:19:22,240 --> 00:19:26,950
they were mostly made
done by like dumpster diving for trash

966
00:19:26,950 --> 00:19:26,960
done by like dumpster diving for trash
 

967
00:19:26,960 --> 00:19:29,270
done by like dumpster diving for trash
you know and you know one of my big

968
00:19:29,270 --> 00:19:29,280
you know and you know one of my big
 

969
00:19:29,280 --> 00:19:31,029
you know and you know one of my big
hauls was

970
00:19:31,029 --> 00:19:31,039
hauls was
 

971
00:19:31,039 --> 00:19:34,310
hauls was
uh discarded relay racks from the back

972
00:19:34,310 --> 00:19:34,320
uh discarded relay racks from the back
 

973
00:19:34,320 --> 00:19:35,270
uh discarded relay racks from the back
of a

974
00:19:35,270 --> 00:19:35,280
of a
 

975
00:19:35,280 --> 00:19:37,590
of a
the phone company switching center oh

976
00:19:37,590 --> 00:19:37,600
the phone company switching center oh
 

977
00:19:37,600 --> 00:19:39,110
the phone company switching center oh
nice

978
00:19:39,110 --> 00:19:39,120
nice
 

979
00:19:39,120 --> 00:19:41,510
nice
that was the big memorable treasure oh

980
00:19:41,510 --> 00:19:41,520
that was the big memorable treasure oh
 

981
00:19:41,520 --> 00:19:42,630
that was the big memorable treasure oh
yeah yeah

982
00:19:42,630 --> 00:19:42,640
yeah yeah
 

983
00:19:42,640 --> 00:19:45,270
yeah yeah
that was what do you use that for i i

984
00:19:45,270 --> 00:19:45,280
that was what do you use that for i i
 

985
00:19:45,280 --> 00:19:50,390
that was what do you use that for i i
built a machine that played tic-tac-toe

986
00:19:50,390 --> 00:19:50,400

 

987
00:19:50,400 --> 00:19:52,549

nice out of relays of course the thing

988
00:19:52,549 --> 00:19:52,559
nice out of relays of course the thing
 

989
00:19:52,559 --> 00:19:54,710
nice out of relays of course the thing
that was really hard

990
00:19:54,710 --> 00:19:54,720
that was really hard
 

991
00:19:54,720 --> 00:19:58,150
that was really hard
um was that all the relays required a

992
00:19:58,150 --> 00:19:58,160
um was that all the relays required a
 

993
00:19:58,160 --> 00:20:00,070
um was that all the relays required a
specific voltage

994
00:20:00,070 --> 00:20:00,080
specific voltage
 

995
00:20:00,080 --> 00:20:02,710
specific voltage
but getting a power supply that will

996
00:20:02,710 --> 00:20:02,720
but getting a power supply that will
 

997
00:20:02,720 --> 00:20:03,350
but getting a power supply that will
would

998
00:20:03,350 --> 00:20:03,360
would
 

999
00:20:03,360 --> 00:20:06,310
would
do that voltage was pretty hard and

1000
00:20:06,310 --> 00:20:06,320
do that voltage was pretty hard and
 

1001
00:20:06,320 --> 00:20:07,990
do that voltage was pretty hard and
since i had a bunch of trashed

1002
00:20:07,990 --> 00:20:08,000
since i had a bunch of trashed
 

1003
00:20:08,000 --> 00:20:12,070
since i had a bunch of trashed
television sets i had to

1004
00:20:12,070 --> 00:20:12,080
television sets i had to
 

1005
00:20:12,080 --> 00:20:16,070
television sets i had to
um sort of cobble together something

1006
00:20:16,070 --> 00:20:16,080
um sort of cobble together something
 

1007
00:20:16,080 --> 00:20:17,909
um sort of cobble together something
that was

1008
00:20:17,909 --> 00:20:17,919
that was
 

1009
00:20:17,919 --> 00:20:21,270
that was
wrong but worked um

1010
00:20:21,270 --> 00:20:21,280
wrong but worked um
 

1011
00:20:21,280 --> 00:20:23,350
wrong but worked um
so i was actually running these relays

1012
00:20:23,350 --> 00:20:23,360
so i was actually running these relays
 

1013
00:20:23,360 --> 00:20:26,710
so i was actually running these relays
at 300 volts

1014
00:20:26,710 --> 00:20:26,720

 

1015
00:20:26,720 --> 00:20:29,750

and and none of the electrical

1016
00:20:29,750 --> 00:20:29,760
and and none of the electrical
 

1017
00:20:29,760 --> 00:20:30,710
and and none of the electrical
connections were

1018
00:20:30,710 --> 00:20:30,720
connections were
 

1019
00:20:30,720 --> 00:20:33,830
connections were
like properly sealed off

1020
00:20:33,830 --> 00:20:33,840
like properly sealed off
 

1021
00:20:33,840 --> 00:20:36,630
like properly sealed off

00:20:38,870 --> 00:20:38,880
for so many reasons
 

1025
00:20:38,880 --> 00:20:41,350
for so many reasons
for so many reasons i mean you know

1026
00:20:41,350 --> 00:20:41,360
for so many reasons i mean you know
 

1027

you're
 

1029
00:20:42,480 --> 00:20:44,950
you're
you know it's pretty common for teenage

1030
00:20:44,950 --> 00:20:44,960
you know it's pretty common for teenage
 

1031
00:20:44,960 --> 00:20:45,669
you know it's pretty common for teenage
geeks to

1032
00:20:45,669 --> 00:20:45,679
geeks to
 

1033
00:20:45,679 --> 00:20:48,310
geeks to
discover oh thermite that's real easy to

1034
00:20:48,310 --> 00:20:48,320
discover oh thermite that's real easy to
 

1035
00:20:48,320 --> 00:20:50,390
discover oh thermite that's real easy to
make

1036
00:20:50,390 --> 00:20:50,400
make
 

1037
00:20:50,400 --> 00:20:52,950
make
yeah well i'm glad you did but do you

1038
00:20:52,950 --> 00:20:52,960
yeah well i'm glad you did but do you
 

1039
00:20:52,960 --> 00:20:54,549
yeah well i'm glad you did but do you
remember the

1040
00:20:54,549 --> 00:20:54,559
remember the
 

1041
00:20:54,559 --> 00:20:58,710
remember the
do you remember what program in calgary

1042
00:20:58,710 --> 00:20:58,720
do you remember what program in calgary
 

1043
00:20:58,720 --> 00:21:01,669
do you remember what program in calgary
that you wrote anything that stands out

1044
00:21:01,669 --> 00:21:01,679
that you wrote anything that stands out
 

1045
00:21:01,679 --> 00:21:03,669
that you wrote anything that stands out
and what language

1046
00:21:03,669 --> 00:21:03,679
and what language
 

1047
00:21:03,679 --> 00:21:06,789
and what language
well so mostly the

1048
00:21:06,789 --> 00:21:06,799
well so mostly the
 

1049
00:21:06,799 --> 00:21:09,990
well so mostly the
anything of any size was

1050
00:21:09,990 --> 00:21:10,000
anything of any size was
 

1051
00:21:10,000 --> 00:21:14,870
anything of any size was
assembly code um

1052
00:21:14,870 --> 00:21:14,880

 

1053
00:21:14,880 --> 00:21:17,029

and actually before i learned assembly

1054
00:21:17,029 --> 00:21:17,039
and actually before i learned assembly
 

1055
00:21:17,039 --> 00:21:18,149
and actually before i learned assembly
code there was this

1056
00:21:18,149 --> 00:21:18,159
code there was this
 

1057
00:21:18,159 --> 00:21:20,230
code there was this
programming language on the pdp called

1058
00:21:20,230 --> 00:21:20,240
programming language on the pdp called
 

1059
00:21:20,240 --> 00:21:22,710
programming language on the pdp called
focal five

1060
00:21:22,710 --> 00:21:22,720
focal five
 

1061
00:21:22,720 --> 00:21:25,029
focal five
and focal five was kind of like a really

1062
00:21:25,029 --> 00:21:25,039
and focal five was kind of like a really
 

1063
00:21:25,039 --> 00:21:25,990
and focal five was kind of like a really
stripped down

1064
00:21:25,990 --> 00:21:26,000
stripped down
 

1065
00:21:26,000 --> 00:21:29,430
stripped down
fortran and

1066
00:21:29,430 --> 00:21:29,440
fortran and
 

1067
00:21:29,440 --> 00:21:32,310
fortran and
i remember playing but you know building

1068
00:21:32,310 --> 00:21:32,320
i remember playing but you know building
 

1069
00:21:32,320 --> 00:21:34,470
i remember playing but you know building
programs that did things like

1070
00:21:34,470 --> 00:21:34,480
programs that did things like
 

1071
00:21:34,480 --> 00:21:37,930
programs that did things like
um play blackjack um

1072
00:21:37,930 --> 00:21:37,940
um play blackjack um
 

1073
00:21:37,940 --> 00:21:39,029
um play blackjack um

or solitaire or for some reason or the
things that

1078
00:21:44,310 --> 00:21:44,320
things that
 

1079
00:21:44,320 --> 00:21:46,710
things that
i really liked were ones where they were

1080
00:21:46,710 --> 00:21:46,720
i really liked were ones where they were
 

1081
00:21:46,720 --> 00:21:47,350
i really liked were ones where they were
just like

1082
00:21:47,350 --> 00:21:47,360
just like
 

1083
00:21:47,360 --> 00:21:51,430
just like
plotting graphs so something with

1084
00:21:51,430 --> 00:21:51,440
plotting graphs so something with
 

1085
00:21:51,440 --> 00:21:54,310
plotting graphs so something with
uh like a function or a data and then

1086
00:21:54,310 --> 00:21:54,320
uh like a function or a data and then
 

1087
00:21:54,320 --> 00:21:55,430
uh like a function or a data and then
you'd plot it

1088
00:21:55,430 --> 00:21:55,440
you'd plot it
 

1089
00:21:55,440 --> 00:21:58,789
you'd plot it
yeah yeah i did a bunches of those

1090
00:21:58,789 --> 00:21:58,799
yeah yeah i did a bunches of those
 

1091
00:21:58,799 --> 00:21:59,590
yeah yeah i did a bunches of those
things and

1092
00:21:59,590 --> 00:21:59,600
things and
 

1093
00:21:59,600 --> 00:22:03,029
things and
went ooh pretty pictures um

1094
00:22:03,029 --> 00:22:03,039
went ooh pretty pictures um
 

1095
00:22:03,039 --> 00:22:05,830
went ooh pretty pictures um
and so this would like print out again

1096
00:22:05,830 --> 00:22:05,840
and so this would like print out again
 

1097
00:22:05,840 --> 00:22:06,310
and so this would like print out again
no

1098
00:22:06,310 --> 00:22:06,320
no
 

1099
00:22:06,320 --> 00:22:09,430
no
no monitors right so it was like

1100
00:22:09,430 --> 00:22:09,440
no monitors right so it was like
 

1101
00:22:09,440 --> 00:22:13,270
no monitors right so it was like
on a teletype yeah

1102
00:22:13,270 --> 00:22:13,280
on a teletype yeah
 

1103
00:22:13,280 --> 00:22:16,470
on a teletype yeah
so using something that's kind of like a

1104
00:22:16,470 --> 00:22:16,480
so using something that's kind of like a
 

1105
00:22:16,480 --> 00:22:20,230
so using something that's kind of like a
a typewriter and then using those

1106
00:22:20,230 --> 00:22:20,240
a typewriter and then using those
 

1107
00:22:20,240 --> 00:22:24,950
a typewriter and then using those
to plot functions so when i apologize to

1108
00:22:24,950 --> 00:22:24,960
to plot functions so when i apologize to
 

1109
00:22:24,960 --> 00:22:26,070
to plot functions so when i apologize to
romanticize things

1110
00:22:26,070 --> 00:22:26,080
romanticize things
 

1111
00:22:26,080 --> 00:22:30,149
romanticize things
but when did you first fall in love with

1112
00:22:30,149 --> 00:22:30,159
but when did you first fall in love with
 

1113
00:22:30,159 --> 00:22:33,029
but when did you first fall in love with
programming you know what was the first

1114
00:22:33,029 --> 00:22:33,039
programming you know what was the first
 

1115
00:22:33,039 --> 00:22:34,950
programming you know what was the first
programming language like it's a serious

1116
00:22:34,950 --> 00:22:34,960
programming language like it's a serious
 

1117
00:22:34,960 --> 00:22:36,710
programming language like it's a serious
maybe software engineer where you

1118
00:22:36,710 --> 00:22:36,720
maybe software engineer where you
 

1119
00:22:36,720 --> 00:22:38,830
maybe software engineer where you
thought this is a beautiful

1120
00:22:38,830 --> 00:22:38,840
thought this is a beautiful
 

1121
00:22:38,840 --> 00:22:41,750
thought this is a beautiful
thing i guess i never really thought of

1122
00:22:41,750 --> 00:22:41,760
thing i guess i never really thought of
 

1123
00:22:41,760 --> 00:22:44,310
thing i guess i never really thought of
any particular language as being like

1124
00:22:44,310 --> 00:22:44,320
any particular language as being like
 

1125
00:22:44,320 --> 00:22:46,549
any particular language as being like
beautiful because it was never really

1126
00:22:46,549 --> 00:22:46,559
beautiful because it was never really
 

1127
00:22:46,559 --> 00:22:48,390
beautiful because it was never really
about the language for me it was about

1128
00:22:48,390 --> 00:22:48,400
about the language for me it was about
 

1129
00:22:48,400 --> 00:22:51,029
about the language for me it was about
what you could do with it

1130
00:22:51,029 --> 00:22:51,039
what you could do with it
 

1131
00:22:51,039 --> 00:22:54,390
what you could do with it
um and you know even today

1132
00:22:54,390 --> 00:22:54,400
um and you know even today
 

1133
00:22:54,400 --> 00:22:55,830
um and you know even today
you know people try to get me into

1134
00:22:55,830 --> 00:22:55,840
you know people try to get me into
 

1135
00:22:55,840 --> 00:22:57,510
you know people try to get me into
arguments about

1136
00:22:57,510 --> 00:22:57,520
arguments about
 

1137
00:22:57,520 --> 00:23:00,149
arguments about
particular forms of syntax for this or

1138
00:23:00,149 --> 00:23:00,159
particular forms of syntax for this or
 

1139
00:23:00,159 --> 00:23:01,430
particular forms of syntax for this or
that and i'm like

1140
00:23:01,430 --> 00:23:01,440
that and i'm like
 

1141
00:23:01,440 --> 00:23:04,149
that and i'm like
who cares you know it's it's about what

1142
00:23:04,149 --> 00:23:04,159
who cares you know it's it's about what
 

1143
00:23:04,159 --> 00:23:04,789
who cares you know it's it's about what
you can do

1144
00:23:04,789 --> 00:23:04,799
you can do
 

1145
00:23:04,799 --> 00:23:08,710
you can do
not not not how you spell the word

1146
00:23:08,710 --> 00:23:08,720
not not not how you spell the word
 

1147
00:23:08,720 --> 00:23:12,950
not not not how you spell the word
um and you know so back in those days i

1148

um and you know so back in those days i
 

1149
00:23:12,960 --> 00:23:16,630
um and you know so back in those days i
i learned like pl one and fortran

1150
00:23:16,630 --> 00:23:16,640
i learned like pl one and fortran
 

1151
00:23:16,640 --> 00:23:20,470
i learned like pl one and fortran
and cobalt and and you know by the time

1152
00:23:20,470 --> 00:23:20,480
and cobalt and and you know by the time
 

1153
00:23:20,480 --> 00:23:20,870
and cobalt and and you know by the time
that

1154

that
 

1155
00:23:20,880 --> 00:23:23,590
that
people were willing to hire me to do

stuff
 

1159
00:23:24,400 --> 00:23:28,230
stuff
you know it was mostly assembly code and

1160
00:23:28,230 --> 00:23:28,240
you know it was mostly assembly code and
 

1161
00:23:28,240 --> 00:23:31,350
you know it was mostly assembly code and
you know pvp assembly code and and

cdc 6400 which was an

1168
00:23:38,950 --> 00:23:38,960
cdc 6400 which was an
 

1169
00:23:38,960 --> 00:23:43,110
cdc 6400 which was an
early i guess super computer

1170
00:23:43,110 --> 00:23:43,120
early i guess super computer
 

1171
00:23:43,120 --> 00:23:45,510
early i guess super computer
even though that super computer has less

1172
00:23:45,510 --> 00:23:45,520
even though that super computer has less
 

1173
00:23:45,520 --> 00:23:47,830
even though that super computer has less
compute power than my phone

1174
00:23:47,830 --> 00:23:47,840
compute power than my phone
 

1175
00:23:47,840 --> 00:23:51,750
compute power than my phone
by a lot and that was mostly

1176
00:23:51,750 --> 00:23:51,760
by a lot and that was mostly
 

1177
00:23:51,760 --> 00:23:54,789
by a lot and that was mostly
like said fortran yeah world

1178
00:23:54,789 --> 00:23:54,799
like said fortran yeah world
 

1179
00:23:54,799 --> 00:23:56,630
like said fortran yeah world
that said you've also showed

1180
00:23:56,630 --> 00:23:56,640
that said you've also showed
 

1181
00:23:56,640 --> 00:23:59,350
that said you've also showed
appreciation for the greatest language

1182
00:23:59,350 --> 00:23:59,360
appreciation for the greatest language
 

1183
00:23:59,360 --> 00:24:02,870
appreciation for the greatest language
um ever that i think everyone agrees is

1184
00:24:02,870 --> 00:24:02,880
um ever that i think everyone agrees is
 

1185
00:24:02,880 --> 00:24:04,230
um ever that i think everyone agrees is
lisp

1186
00:24:04,230 --> 00:24:04,240
lisp
 

1187
00:24:04,240 --> 00:24:07,909
lisp
um well lisp was definitely on my list

1188
00:24:07,909 --> 00:24:07,919
um well lisp was definitely on my list
 

1189
00:24:07,919 --> 00:24:10,950
um well lisp was definitely on my list
of the greatest ones that have have um

1190
00:24:10,950 --> 00:24:10,960
of the greatest ones that have have um
 

1191
00:24:10,960 --> 00:24:14,070
of the greatest ones that have have um
existed is that number one or i mean

1192
00:24:14,070 --> 00:24:14,080
existed is that number one or i mean
 

1193
00:24:14,080 --> 00:24:16,870
existed is that number one or i mean
um are you i mean you know that you know

1194
00:24:16,870 --> 00:24:16,880
um are you i mean you know that you know
 

1195
00:24:16,880 --> 00:24:18,789
um are you i mean you know that you know
the thing is that it's it that you you

1196
00:24:18,789 --> 00:24:18,799
the thing is that it's it that you you
 

1197
00:24:18,799 --> 00:24:21,029
the thing is that it's it that you you
know

1198
00:24:21,029 --> 00:24:21,039

 

1199
00:24:21,039 --> 00:24:23,590

i wouldn't put it number one now is it

1200
00:24:23,590 --> 00:24:23,600
i wouldn't put it number one now is it
 

1201
00:24:23,600 --> 00:24:25,510
i wouldn't put it number one now is it
the parentheses what uh

1202
00:24:25,510 --> 00:24:25,520
the parentheses what uh
 

1203
00:24:25,520 --> 00:24:29,350
the parentheses what uh
um what do you love what do you not love

1204
00:24:29,350 --> 00:24:29,360
um what do you love what do you not love
 

1205
00:24:29,360 --> 00:24:31,350
um what do you love what do you not love
about lisp

1206
00:24:31,350 --> 00:24:31,360
about lisp
 

1207
00:24:31,360 --> 00:24:35,830
about lisp
um well i guess the number one thing to

1208
00:24:35,830 --> 00:24:35,840
um well i guess the number one thing to
 

1209
00:24:35,840 --> 00:24:38,070
um well i guess the number one thing to
not love about it is so freaking many

1210
00:24:38,070 --> 00:24:38,080
not love about it is so freaking many
 

1211
00:24:38,080 --> 00:24:41,669
not love about it is so freaking many
parentheses yeah um on the

1212
00:24:41,669 --> 00:24:41,679
parentheses yeah um on the
 

1213
00:24:41,679 --> 00:24:44,830
parentheses yeah um on the
on the love thing is you know out of

1214
00:24:44,830 --> 00:24:44,840
on the love thing is you know out of
 

1215
00:24:44,840 --> 00:24:46,070
on the love thing is you know out of
those

1216
00:24:46,070 --> 00:24:46,080
those
 

1217
00:24:46,080 --> 00:24:48,950
those
tons of parentheses you actually get an

1218
00:24:48,950 --> 00:24:48,960
tons of parentheses you actually get an
 

1219
00:24:48,960 --> 00:24:51,750
tons of parentheses you actually get an
interesting language structure

1220
00:24:51,750 --> 00:24:51,760
interesting language structure
 

1221
00:24:51,760 --> 00:24:53,350
interesting language structure
and i've always thought that there was a

1222
00:24:53,350 --> 00:24:53,360
and i've always thought that there was a
 

1223
00:24:53,360 --> 00:24:54,950
and i've always thought that there was a
friendlier version of lisp

1224
00:24:54,950 --> 00:24:54,960
friendlier version of lisp
 

1225
00:24:54,960 --> 00:24:58,390
friendlier version of lisp
hiding out there somewhere but i've

1226
00:24:58,390 --> 00:24:58,400
hiding out there somewhere but i've
 

1227
00:24:58,400 --> 00:24:59,430
hiding out there somewhere but i've
never really

1228
00:24:59,430 --> 00:24:59,440
never really
 

1229
00:24:59,440 --> 00:25:02,549
never really
spent much time thinking about thinking

1230
00:25:02,549 --> 00:25:02,559
spent much time thinking about thinking
 

1231
00:25:02,559 --> 00:25:03,510
spent much time thinking about thinking
about it but

1232
00:25:03,510 --> 00:25:03,520
about it but
 

1233
00:25:03,520 --> 00:25:07,029
about it but
you know so like like up the food chain

1234
00:25:07,029 --> 00:25:07,039
you know so like like up the food chain
 

1235
00:25:07,039 --> 00:25:10,710
you know so like like up the food chain
for me um then from lisp is

1236
00:25:10,710 --> 00:25:10,720
for me um then from lisp is
 

1237
00:25:10,720 --> 00:25:14,070
for me um then from lisp is
simula which a very small number of

1238
00:25:14,070 --> 00:25:14,080
simula which a very small number of
 

1239
00:25:14,080 --> 00:25:16,070
simula which a very small number of
people have ever used

1240
00:25:16,070 --> 00:25:16,080
people have ever used
 

1241
00:25:16,080 --> 00:25:18,230
people have ever used
but a lot of people i think he had a

1242
00:25:18,230 --> 00:25:18,240
but a lot of people i think he had a
 

1243
00:25:18,240 --> 00:25:19,510
but a lot of people i think he had a
huge influence right

1244
00:25:19,510 --> 00:25:19,520
huge influence right
 

1245
00:25:19,520 --> 00:25:22,950
huge influence right
yeah the programming but in the simula

1246
00:25:22,950 --> 00:25:22,960
yeah the programming but in the simula
 

1247
00:25:22,960 --> 00:25:25,190
yeah the programming but in the simula
i apologize if i'm wrong on this but is

1248
00:25:25,190 --> 00:25:25,200
i apologize if i'm wrong on this but is
 

1249
00:25:25,200 --> 00:25:26,470
i apologize if i'm wrong on this but is
that one of the first functional

1250
00:25:26,470 --> 00:25:26,480
that one of the first functional
 

1251
00:25:26,480 --> 00:25:27,190
that one of the first functional
languages

1252
00:25:27,190 --> 00:25:27,200
languages
 

1253
00:25:27,200 --> 00:25:29,830
languages
um or no no it was it was it was the

1254
00:25:29,830 --> 00:25:29,840
um or no no it was it was it was the
 

1255
00:25:29,840 --> 00:25:31,510
um or no no it was it was it was the
first object-oriented programming

1256
00:25:31,510 --> 00:25:31,520
first object-oriented programming
 

1257
00:25:31,520 --> 00:25:32,149
first object-oriented programming
language

1258
00:25:32,149 --> 00:25:32,159
language
 

1259
00:25:32,159 --> 00:25:35,430
language
got it it's really where object-oriented

1260
00:25:35,430 --> 00:25:35,440
got it it's really where object-oriented
 

1261
00:25:35,440 --> 00:25:38,390
got it it's really where object-oriented
and languages sort of came together

1262
00:25:38,390 --> 00:25:38,400
and languages sort of came together
 

1263
00:25:38,400 --> 00:25:42,470
and languages sort of came together
um and it was also the

1264
00:25:42,470 --> 00:25:42,480
um and it was also the
 

1265
00:25:42,480 --> 00:25:45,669
um and it was also the
the language where co routines first

1266
00:25:45,669 --> 00:25:45,679
the language where co routines first
 

1267
00:25:45,679 --> 00:25:48,549
the language where co routines first
showed up as a part of the language

1268
00:25:48,549 --> 00:25:48,559
showed up as a part of the language
 

1269
00:25:48,559 --> 00:25:51,590
showed up as a part of the language
so you could have a programming style

1270
00:25:51,590 --> 00:25:51,600
so you could have a programming style
 

1271
00:25:51,600 --> 00:25:53,750
so you could have a programming style
that was

1272
00:25:53,750 --> 00:25:53,760
that was
 

1273
00:25:53,760 --> 00:25:55,990
that was
you could think of it as multiple uh

1274
00:25:55,990 --> 00:25:56,000
you could think of it as multiple uh
 

1275
00:25:56,000 --> 00:25:57,510
you could think of it as multiple uh
sort of multi-threaded

1276
00:25:57,510 --> 00:25:57,520
sort of multi-threaded
 

1277
00:25:57,520 --> 00:26:00,789
sort of multi-threaded
with a lot of parallel parallelism

1278
00:26:00,789 --> 00:26:00,799
with a lot of parallel parallelism
 

1279
00:26:00,799 --> 00:26:03,110
with a lot of parallel parallelism
really there's ideas of parallelism in

1280
00:26:03,110 --> 00:26:03,120
really there's ideas of parallelism in
 

1281
00:26:03,120 --> 00:26:05,269
really there's ideas of parallelism in
there yeah

1282
00:26:05,269 --> 00:26:05,279
there yeah
 

1283
00:26:05,279 --> 00:26:08,149
there yeah
yeah so that was that was back you know

1284
00:26:08,149 --> 00:26:08,159
yeah so that was that was back you know
 

1285
00:26:08,159 --> 00:26:12,789
yeah so that was that was back you know
so the first stimulus spec was simula 67

1286
00:26:12,789 --> 00:26:12,799
so the first stimulus spec was simula 67
 

1287
00:26:12,799 --> 00:26:15,830
so the first stimulus spec was simula 67
like 1967. yeah

1288
00:26:15,830 --> 00:26:15,840
like 1967. yeah
 

1289
00:26:15,840 --> 00:26:19,350
like 1967. yeah
wow so it had it it had co-routines

1290
00:26:19,350 --> 00:26:19,360
wow so it had it it had co-routines
 

1291
00:26:19,360 --> 00:26:20,230
wow so it had it it had co-routines
which are

1292
00:26:20,230 --> 00:26:20,240
which are
 

1293
00:26:20,240 --> 00:26:23,269
which are
almost threads the the thing about co

1294
00:26:23,269 --> 00:26:23,279
almost threads the the thing about co
 

1295
00:26:23,279 --> 00:26:24,950
almost threads the the thing about co
routines is that they don't have

1296
00:26:24,950 --> 00:26:24,960
routines is that they don't have
 

1297
00:26:24,960 --> 00:26:28,310
routines is that they don't have
true concurrency so you can get away

1298
00:26:28,310 --> 00:26:28,320
true concurrency so you can get away
 

1299
00:26:28,320 --> 00:26:30,149
true concurrency so you can get away
without

1300
00:26:30,149 --> 00:26:30,159
without
 

1301
00:26:30,159 --> 00:26:33,510
without
um really complex locking you can't

1302
00:26:33,510 --> 00:26:33,520
um really complex locking you can't
 

1303
00:26:33,520 --> 00:26:37,029
um really complex locking you can't
usably do co-routines on a

1304
00:26:37,029 --> 00:26:37,039
usably do co-routines on a
 

1305
00:26:37,039 --> 00:26:40,310
usably do co-routines on a
on the multi-core machine or if you try

1306
00:26:40,310 --> 00:26:40,320
on the multi-core machine or if you try
 

1307
00:26:40,320 --> 00:26:41,029
on the multi-core machine or if you try
to do core

1308
00:26:41,029 --> 00:26:41,039
to do core
 

1309
00:26:41,039 --> 00:26:43,590
to do core
code routines on the multi-core mute

1310
00:26:43,590 --> 00:26:43,600
code routines on the multi-core mute
 

1311
00:26:43,600 --> 00:26:44,870
code routines on the multi-core mute
machine you

1312
00:26:44,870 --> 00:26:44,880
machine you
 

1313
00:26:44,880 --> 00:26:46,630
machine you
don't actually get to use the multiple

1314
00:26:46,630 --> 00:26:46,640
don't actually get to use the multiple
 

1315
00:26:46,640 --> 00:26:47,909
don't actually get to use the multiple
cores

1316
00:26:47,909 --> 00:26:47,919
cores
 

1317
00:26:47,919 --> 00:26:50,390
cores
um either that or you you know because

1318
00:26:50,390 --> 00:26:50,400
um either that or you you know because
 

1319
00:26:50,400 --> 00:26:51,190
um either that or you you know because
you start

1320
00:26:51,190 --> 00:26:51,200
you start
 

1321
00:26:51,200 --> 00:26:55,029
you start
then having to get into the universe of

1322
00:26:55,029 --> 00:26:55,039
then having to get into the universe of
 

1323
00:26:55,039 --> 00:26:57,430
then having to get into the universe of
you know semaphores and locks and things

1324
00:26:57,430 --> 00:26:57,440
you know semaphores and locks and things
 

1325
00:26:57,440 --> 00:26:58,549
you know semaphores and locks and things
like that

1326
00:26:58,549 --> 00:26:58,559
like that
 

1327
00:26:58,559 --> 00:27:02,710
like that
um but you know in terms of the

1328
00:27:02,710 --> 00:27:02,720
um but you know in terms of the
 

1329
00:27:02,720 --> 00:27:06,310
um but you know in terms of the
the style of programming you could

1330
00:27:06,310 --> 00:27:06,320
the style of programming you could
 

1331
00:27:06,320 --> 00:27:09,110
the style of programming you could
write code and think think of it as

1332
00:27:09,110 --> 00:27:09,120
write code and think think of it as
 

1333
00:27:09,120 --> 00:27:09,830
write code and think think of it as
being

1334
00:27:09,830 --> 00:27:09,840
being
 

1335
00:27:09,840 --> 00:27:13,590
being
multi-threaded the mental model

1336
00:27:13,590 --> 00:27:13,600
multi-threaded the mental model
 

1337
00:27:13,600 --> 00:27:17,269
multi-threaded the mental model
was very much a multi-threaded one and

1338
00:27:17,269 --> 00:27:17,279
was very much a multi-threaded one and
 

1339
00:27:17,279 --> 00:27:19,269
was very much a multi-threaded one and
all kinds of problems you could approach

1340
00:27:19,269 --> 00:27:19,279
all kinds of problems you could approach
 

1341
00:27:19,279 --> 00:27:22,389
all kinds of problems you could approach
very differently

1342
00:27:22,389 --> 00:27:22,399

 

1343
00:27:22,399 --> 00:27:26,070

to to return to uh the world of lisp for

1344
00:27:26,070 --> 00:27:26,080
to to return to uh the world of lisp for
 

1345
00:27:26,080 --> 00:27:29,590
to to return to uh the world of lisp for
a brief moment you uh at cmu you've

1346
00:27:29,590 --> 00:27:29,600
a brief moment you uh at cmu you've
 

1347
00:27:29,600 --> 00:27:32,870
a brief moment you uh at cmu you've
you uh wrote a version of emacs

1348
00:27:32,870 --> 00:27:32,880
you uh wrote a version of emacs
 

1349
00:27:32,880 --> 00:27:34,710
you uh wrote a version of emacs
that i think was very impactful on the

1350
00:27:34,710 --> 00:27:34,720
that i think was very impactful on the
 

1351
00:27:34,720 --> 00:27:35,990
that i think was very impactful on the
history of emacs

1352
00:27:35,990 --> 00:27:36,000
history of emacs
 

1353
00:27:36,000 --> 00:27:40,230
history of emacs
um what was your motivation

1354
00:27:40,230 --> 00:27:40,240
um what was your motivation
 

1355
00:27:40,240 --> 00:27:44,549
um what was your motivation
for for doing so at that time

1356
00:27:44,549 --> 00:27:44,559
for for doing so at that time
 

1357
00:27:44,559 --> 00:27:51,110
for for doing so at that time
so that was in like 85 or 86.

1358
00:27:51,110 --> 00:27:51,120
so that was in like 85 or 86.
 

1359
00:27:51,120 --> 00:27:54,310
so that was in like 85 or 86.
um i had been using

1360
00:27:54,310 --> 00:27:54,320
um i had been using
 

1361
00:27:54,320 --> 00:27:57,590
um i had been using
unix for a few years

1362
00:27:57,590 --> 00:27:57,600
unix for a few years
 

1363
00:27:57,600 --> 00:28:01,510
unix for a few years
and um most of the editing was

1364
00:28:01,510 --> 00:28:01,520
and um most of the editing was
 

1365
00:28:01,520 --> 00:28:05,430
and um most of the editing was
this this tool called edie um

1366
00:28:05,430 --> 00:28:05,440
this this tool called edie um
 

1367
00:28:05,440 --> 00:28:09,669
this this tool called edie um
which was sort of an ancestor of vi

1368
00:28:09,669 --> 00:28:09,679
which was sort of an ancestor of vi
 

1369
00:28:09,679 --> 00:28:13,190
which was sort of an ancestor of vi
and is it a pretty good editor

1370
00:28:13,190 --> 00:28:13,200
and is it a pretty good editor
 

1371
00:28:13,200 --> 00:28:15,669
and is it a pretty good editor
not a good editor well if if what you're

1372
00:28:15,669 --> 00:28:15,679
not a good editor well if if what you're
 

1373
00:28:15,679 --> 00:28:16,789
not a good editor well if if what you're
using

1374
00:28:16,789 --> 00:28:16,799
using
 

1375
00:28:16,799 --> 00:28:20,630
using
um if your input device is a teletype

1376
00:28:20,630 --> 00:28:20,640
um if your input device is a teletype
 

1377
00:28:20,640 --> 00:28:23,269
um if your input device is a teletype
it's pretty good yeah it's certainly

1378
00:28:23,269 --> 00:28:23,279
it's pretty good yeah it's certainly
 

1379
00:28:23,279 --> 00:28:25,669
it's pretty good yeah it's certainly
more humane than tico

1380
00:28:25,669 --> 00:28:25,679
more humane than tico
 

1381
00:28:25,679 --> 00:28:28,070
more humane than tico
which was kind of the the common thing

1382
00:28:28,070 --> 00:28:28,080
which was kind of the the common thing
 

1383
00:28:28,080 --> 00:28:28,789
which was kind of the the common thing
in

1384
00:28:28,789 --> 00:28:28,799
in
 

1385
00:28:28,799 --> 00:28:32,470
in
a lot of um the dec universe at the time

1386
00:28:32,470 --> 00:28:32,480
a lot of um the dec universe at the time
 

1387
00:28:32,480 --> 00:28:36,870
a lot of um the dec universe at the time
tico is both tk is that the tico t-e-c-o

1388
00:28:36,870 --> 00:28:36,880
tico is both tk is that the tico t-e-c-o
 

1389
00:28:36,880 --> 00:28:39,990
tico is both tk is that the tico t-e-c-o
the text editor and corrector corrector

1390
00:28:39,990 --> 00:28:40,000
the text editor and corrector corrector
 

1391
00:28:40,000 --> 00:28:40,470
the text editor and corrector corrector
huh

1392
00:28:40,470 --> 00:28:40,480
huh
 

1393
00:28:40,480 --> 00:28:44,070
huh
so many features um

1394
00:28:44,070 --> 00:28:44,080
so many features um
 

1395
00:28:44,080 --> 00:28:47,110
so many features um
and the original emacs

1396
00:28:47,110 --> 00:28:47,120
and the original emacs
 

1397
00:28:47,120 --> 00:28:50,230
and the original emacs
came out as so emac stands for editor

1398
00:28:50,230 --> 00:28:50,240
came out as so emac stands for editor
 

1399
00:28:50,240 --> 00:28:52,149
came out as so emac stands for editor
macros

1400
00:28:52,149 --> 00:28:52,159
macros
 

1401
00:28:52,159 --> 00:28:56,549
macros
and tico had a way of writing macros

1402
00:28:56,549 --> 00:28:56,559
and tico had a way of writing macros
 

1403
00:28:56,559 --> 00:28:59,669
and tico had a way of writing macros
and so the original um

1404
00:28:59,669 --> 00:28:59,679
and so the original um
 

1405
00:28:59,679 --> 00:29:03,510
and so the original um
emacs from mit sort of started out as

1406
00:29:03,510 --> 00:29:03,520
emacs from mit sort of started out as
 

1407
00:29:03,520 --> 00:29:07,029
emacs from mit sort of started out as
a collection of macros for tico

1408
00:29:07,029 --> 00:29:07,039
a collection of macros for tico
 

1409
00:29:07,039 --> 00:29:09,590
a collection of macros for tico
but then you know you know the the sort

1410
00:29:09,590 --> 00:29:09,600
but then you know you know the the sort
 

1411
00:29:09,600 --> 00:29:10,389
but then you know you know the the sort
of emac

1412
00:29:10,389 --> 00:29:10,399
of emac
 

1413
00:29:10,399 --> 00:29:14,070
of emac
style got got popular originally at

1414
00:29:14,070 --> 00:29:14,080
style got got popular originally at
 

1415
00:29:14,080 --> 00:29:18,389
style got got popular originally at
at mit and then people

1416
00:29:18,389 --> 00:29:18,399
at mit and then people
 

1417
00:29:18,399 --> 00:29:21,510
at mit and then people
did a few other implementations of emacs

1418
00:29:21,510 --> 00:29:21,520
did a few other implementations of emacs
 

1419
00:29:21,520 --> 00:29:24,789
did a few other implementations of emacs
that were you know the the the code base

1420
00:29:24,789 --> 00:29:24,799
that were you know the the the code base
 

1421
00:29:24,799 --> 00:29:26,630
that were you know the the the code base
was entirely different but it was sort

1422
00:29:26,630 --> 00:29:26,640
was entirely different but it was sort
 

1423
00:29:26,640 --> 00:29:28,789
was entirely different but it was sort
of the philosophical style

1424
00:29:28,789 --> 00:29:28,799
of the philosophical style
 

1425
00:29:28,799 --> 00:29:31,750
of the philosophical style
of the original emacs what was the

1426
00:29:31,750 --> 00:29:31,760
of the original emacs what was the
 

1427
00:29:31,760 --> 00:29:33,990
of the original emacs what was the
philosophy of emacs and by the way were

1428
00:29:33,990 --> 00:29:34,000
philosophy of emacs and by the way were
 

1429
00:29:34,000 --> 00:29:36,549
philosophy of emacs and by the way were
all the implementations always in c

1430
00:29:36,549 --> 00:29:36,559
all the implementations always in c
 

1431
00:29:36,559 --> 00:29:38,870
all the implementations always in c
and then no and how does lisp fit into

1432
00:29:38,870 --> 00:29:38,880
and then no and how does lisp fit into
 

1433
00:29:38,880 --> 00:29:39,590
and then no and how does lisp fit into
the picture

1434
00:29:39,590 --> 00:29:39,600
the picture
 

1435
00:29:39,600 --> 00:29:42,870
the picture
no so so the very first emacs was

1436
00:29:42,870 --> 00:29:42,880
no so so the very first emacs was
 

1437
00:29:42,880 --> 00:29:45,029
no so so the very first emacs was
written as a bunch of macros for the

1438
00:29:45,029 --> 00:29:45,039
written as a bunch of macros for the
 

1439
00:29:45,039 --> 00:29:46,389
written as a bunch of macros for the
tico text editor

1440
00:29:46,389 --> 00:29:46,399
tico text editor
 

1441
00:29:46,399 --> 00:29:49,750
tico text editor
wow this is so interesting and the

1442
00:29:49,750 --> 00:29:49,760
wow this is so interesting and the
 

1443
00:29:49,760 --> 00:29:53,190
wow this is so interesting and the
the the macro language for tico

1444
00:29:53,190 --> 00:29:53,200
the the macro language for tico
 

1445
00:29:53,200 --> 00:29:56,149
the the macro language for tico
was probably the most ridiculously

1446
00:29:56,149 --> 00:29:56,159
was probably the most ridiculously
 

1447
00:29:56,159 --> 00:29:57,830
was probably the most ridiculously
obscure

1448
00:29:57,830 --> 00:29:57,840
obscure
 

1449
00:29:57,840 --> 00:30:00,230
obscure
format you know if you just look at a

1450
00:30:00,230 --> 00:30:00,240
format you know if you just look at a
 

1451
00:30:00,240 --> 00:30:01,669
format you know if you just look at a
tico program on a

1452
00:30:01,669 --> 00:30:01,679
tico program on a
 

1453
00:30:01,679 --> 00:30:04,630
tico program on a
on a page you think it was just random

1454
00:30:04,630 --> 00:30:04,640
on a page you think it was just random
 

1455
00:30:04,640 --> 00:30:05,909
on a page you think it was just random
characters

1456
00:30:05,909 --> 00:30:05,919
characters
 

1457
00:30:05,919 --> 00:30:09,510
characters
it really looks like just line noise

1458
00:30:09,510 --> 00:30:09,520
it really looks like just line noise
 

1459
00:30:09,520 --> 00:30:12,389
it really looks like just line noise
just kind of like latex or something oh

1460
00:30:12,389 --> 00:30:12,399
just kind of like latex or something oh
 

1461
00:30:12,399 --> 00:30:13,110
just kind of like latex or something oh
worse

1462
00:30:13,110 --> 00:30:13,120
worse
 

1463
00:30:13,120 --> 00:30:15,909
worse
way worse than the tick way way worse

1464
00:30:15,909 --> 00:30:15,919
way worse than the tick way way worse
 

1465
00:30:15,919 --> 00:30:17,350
way worse than the tick way way worse
than latex

1466
00:30:17,350 --> 00:30:17,360
than latex
 

1467
00:30:17,360 --> 00:30:20,789
than latex
um but you know if you use tico a lot

1468
00:30:20,789 --> 00:30:20,799
um but you know if you use tico a lot
 

1469
00:30:20,799 --> 00:30:24,789
um but you know if you use tico a lot
which i did the the tico was completely

1470
00:30:24,789 --> 00:30:24,799
which i did the the tico was completely
 

1471
00:30:24,799 --> 00:30:27,909
which i did the the tico was completely
optimized for touch typing

1472
00:30:27,909 --> 00:30:27,919
optimized for touch typing
 

1473
00:30:27,919 --> 00:30:31,190
optimized for touch typing
at high speed um

1474
00:30:31,190 --> 00:30:31,200
at high speed um
 

1475
00:30:31,200 --> 00:30:35,269
at high speed um
so there were no two character commands

1476
00:30:35,269 --> 00:30:35,279
so there were no two character commands
 

1477
00:30:35,279 --> 00:30:37,909
so there were no two character commands
well there were a few but mostly they

1478
00:30:37,909 --> 00:30:37,919
well there were a few but mostly they
 

1479
00:30:37,919 --> 00:30:39,590
well there were a few but mostly they
were just one character so every

1480
00:30:39,590 --> 00:30:39,600
were just one character so every
 

1481
00:30:39,600 --> 00:30:41,269
were just one character so every
character on the keyboard was a separate

1482
00:30:41,269 --> 00:30:41,279
character on the keyboard was a separate
 

1483
00:30:41,279 --> 00:30:42,630
character on the keyboard was a separate
command

1484
00:30:42,630 --> 00:30:42,640
command
 

1485
00:30:42,640 --> 00:30:45,350
command
um and actually every character on the

1486
00:30:45,350 --> 00:30:45,360
um and actually every character on the
 

1487
00:30:45,360 --> 00:30:47,590
um and actually every character on the
keyboard was usually two or three

1488
00:30:47,590 --> 00:30:47,600
keyboard was usually two or three
 

1489
00:30:47,600 --> 00:30:50,710
keyboard was usually two or three
commands because you know you hit shift

1490
00:30:50,710 --> 00:30:50,720
commands because you know you hit shift
 

1491
00:30:50,720 --> 00:30:52,470
commands because you know you hit shift
and control and all of those things you

1492
00:30:52,470 --> 00:30:52,480
and control and all of those things you
 

1493
00:30:52,480 --> 00:30:53,669
and control and all of those things you
know it's just a way of

1494
00:30:53,669 --> 00:30:53,679
know it's just a way of
 

1495
00:30:53,679 --> 00:30:57,590
know it's just a way of
very tightly encoding it and

1496
00:30:57,590 --> 00:30:57,600
very tightly encoding it and
 

1497
00:30:57,600 --> 00:31:01,110
very tightly encoding it and
mostly what emacs did was it made that

1498
00:31:01,110 --> 00:31:01,120
mostly what emacs did was it made that
 

1499
00:31:01,120 --> 00:31:04,950
mostly what emacs did was it made that
that visual right so

1500
00:31:04,950 --> 00:31:04,960
that visual right so
 

1501
00:31:04,960 --> 00:31:09,269
that visual right so
one way to think of tico is use emax

1502
00:31:09,269 --> 00:31:09,279
one way to think of tico is use emax
 

1503
00:31:09,279 --> 00:31:13,990
one way to think of tico is use emax
with your eyes closed

1504
00:31:13,990 --> 00:31:14,000

 

1505
00:31:14,000 --> 00:31:15,990

where you have to maintain a mental

1506
00:31:15,990 --> 00:31:16,000
where you have to maintain a mental
 

1507
00:31:16,000 --> 00:31:18,070
where you have to maintain a mental
model of

1508
00:31:18,070 --> 00:31:18,080
model of
 

1509
00:31:18,080 --> 00:31:19,830
model of
you know sort of a mental image of your

1510
00:31:19,830 --> 00:31:19,840
you know sort of a mental image of your
 

1511
00:31:19,840 --> 00:31:21,509
you know sort of a mental image of your
document you have to go

1512
00:31:21,509 --> 00:31:21,519
document you have to go
 

1513
00:31:21,519 --> 00:31:24,549
document you have to go
okay so the the cursor is

1514
00:31:24,549 --> 00:31:24,559
okay so the the cursor is
 

1515
00:31:24,559 --> 00:31:27,830
okay so the the cursor is
between the a and the e

1516
00:31:27,830 --> 00:31:27,840
between the a and the e
 

1517
00:31:27,840 --> 00:31:30,310
between the a and the e
and i want to exchange those so i do

1518
00:31:30,310 --> 00:31:30,320
and i want to exchange those so i do
 

1519
00:31:30,320 --> 00:31:31,029
and i want to exchange those so i do
these

1520
00:31:31,029 --> 00:31:31,039
these
 

1521
00:31:31,039 --> 00:31:34,549
these
these things right so it almost it is

1522
00:31:34,549 --> 00:31:34,559
these things right so it almost it is
 

1523
00:31:34,559 --> 00:31:38,710
these things right so it almost it is
almost exactly the emax command set

1524
00:31:38,710 --> 00:31:38,720
almost exactly the emax command set
 

1525
00:31:38,720 --> 00:31:40,630
almost exactly the emax command set
well it's roughly approximate roughly

1526
00:31:40,630 --> 00:31:40,640
well it's roughly approximate roughly
 

1527
00:31:40,640 --> 00:31:42,710
well it's roughly approximate roughly
the same as emacs command set

1528
00:31:42,710 --> 00:31:42,720
the same as emacs command set
 

1529
00:31:42,720 --> 00:31:46,230
the same as emacs command set
but using emacs with your eyes closed

1530
00:31:46,230 --> 00:31:46,240
but using emacs with your eyes closed
 

1531
00:31:46,240 --> 00:31:49,509
but using emacs with your eyes closed
um so what

1532
00:31:49,509 --> 00:31:49,519
um so what
 

1533
00:31:49,519 --> 00:31:51,990
um so what
emacs you know part of what emacs added

1534
00:31:51,990 --> 00:31:52,000
emacs you know part of what emacs added
 

1535
00:31:52,000 --> 00:31:53,909
emacs you know part of what emacs added
to the whole thing was

1536
00:31:53,909 --> 00:31:53,919
to the whole thing was
 

1537
00:31:53,919 --> 00:31:56,710
to the whole thing was
was being able to visually see what you

1538
00:31:56,710 --> 00:31:56,720
was being able to visually see what you
 

1539
00:31:56,720 --> 00:31:58,470
was being able to visually see what you
were editing

1540
00:31:58,470 --> 00:31:58,480
were editing
 

1541
00:31:58,480 --> 00:32:04,070
were editing
um in a form that matched your document

1542
00:32:04,070 --> 00:32:04,080
um in a form that matched your document
 

1543
00:32:04,080 --> 00:32:07,669
um in a form that matched your document
um and you know a lot of things

1544
00:32:07,669 --> 00:32:07,679
um and you know a lot of things
 

1545
00:32:07,679 --> 00:32:10,950
um and you know a lot of things
changed in the in the command set it

1546
00:32:10,950 --> 00:32:10,960
changed in the in the command set it
 

1547
00:32:10,960 --> 00:32:13,669
changed in the in the command set it
um you know because it was programmable

1548
00:32:13,669 --> 00:32:13,679
um you know because it was programmable
 

1549
00:32:13,679 --> 00:32:14,870
um you know because it was programmable
it was

1550
00:32:14,870 --> 00:32:14,880
it was
 

1551
00:32:14,880 --> 00:32:16,549
it was
really flexible you could add new

1552
00:32:16,549 --> 00:32:16,559
really flexible you could add new
 

1553
00:32:16,559 --> 00:32:18,470
really flexible you could add new
commands for all kinds of things

1554
00:32:18,470 --> 00:32:18,480
commands for all kinds of things
 

1555
00:32:18,480 --> 00:32:22,230
commands for all kinds of things
and then people rewrote emacs

1556
00:32:22,230 --> 00:32:22,240
and then people rewrote emacs
 

1557
00:32:22,240 --> 00:32:25,110
and then people rewrote emacs
like multiple times in lisp there was

1558
00:32:25,110 --> 00:32:25,120
like multiple times in lisp there was
 

1559
00:32:25,120 --> 00:32:25,830
like multiple times in lisp there was
one done at

1560
00:32:25,830 --> 00:32:25,840
one done at
 

1561
00:32:25,840 --> 00:32:28,870
one done at
mit for the lisp machine there was one

1562
00:32:28,870 --> 00:32:28,880
mit for the lisp machine there was one
 

1563
00:32:28,880 --> 00:32:29,909
mit for the lisp machine there was one
done

1564
00:32:29,909 --> 00:32:29,919
done
 

1565
00:32:29,919 --> 00:32:33,830
done
for multix and one summer i got a

1566
00:32:33,830 --> 00:32:33,840
for multix and one summer i got a
 

1567
00:32:33,840 --> 00:32:37,029
for multix and one summer i got a
got a summer job to work on the

1568
00:32:37,029 --> 00:32:37,039
got a summer job to work on the
 

1569
00:32:37,039 --> 00:32:40,310
got a summer job to work on the
pascal compiler for multix

1570
00:32:40,310 --> 00:32:40,320
pascal compiler for multix
 

1571
00:32:40,320 --> 00:32:42,470
pascal compiler for multix
and that was actually the first time i

1572
00:32:42,470 --> 00:32:42,480
and that was actually the first time i
 

1573
00:32:42,480 --> 00:32:44,950
and that was actually the first time i
used emacs

1574
00:32:44,950 --> 00:32:44,960
used emacs
 

1575
00:32:44,960 --> 00:32:48,789
used emacs
and and and so to write the compilers

1576
00:32:48,789 --> 00:32:48,799
and and and so to write the compilers
 

1577
00:32:48,799 --> 00:32:50,950
and and and so to write the compilers
you've worked in compilers too it's yeah

1578
00:32:50,950 --> 00:32:50,960
you've worked in compilers too it's yeah
 

1579
00:32:50,960 --> 00:32:52,149
you've worked in compilers too it's yeah
that's fascinating

1580
00:32:52,149 --> 00:32:52,159
that's fascinating
 

1581
00:32:52,159 --> 00:32:55,509
that's fascinating
yeah so i did a lot of work you know

1582
00:32:55,509 --> 00:32:55,519
yeah so i did a lot of work you know
 

1583
00:32:55,519 --> 00:32:57,430
yeah so i did a lot of work you know
i mean i spent like like a really

1584
00:32:57,430 --> 00:32:57,440
i mean i spent like like a really
 

1585
00:32:57,440 --> 00:32:59,590
i mean i spent like like a really
intense three months

1586
00:32:59,590 --> 00:32:59,600
intense three months
 

1587
00:32:59,600 --> 00:33:03,350
intense three months
working on this pascal compiler um

1588
00:33:03,350 --> 00:33:03,360
working on this pascal compiler um
 

1589
00:33:03,360 --> 00:33:06,630
working on this pascal compiler um
basically living in emacs and it was

1590
00:33:06,630 --> 00:33:06,640
basically living in emacs and it was
 

1591
00:33:06,640 --> 00:33:09,190
basically living in emacs and it was
it was the one written in mac list by

1592
00:33:09,190 --> 00:33:09,200
it was the one written in mac list by
 

1593
00:33:09,200 --> 00:33:11,350
it was the one written in mac list by
bernie greenberg

1594
00:33:11,350 --> 00:33:11,360
bernie greenberg
 

1595
00:33:11,360 --> 00:33:14,789
bernie greenberg
and i thought wow this is a just a way

1596
00:33:14,789 --> 00:33:14,799
and i thought wow this is a just a way
 

1597
00:33:14,799 --> 00:33:17,350
and i thought wow this is a just a way
better way to do editing

1598
00:33:17,350 --> 00:33:17,360
better way to do editing
 

1599
00:33:17,360 --> 00:33:21,430
better way to do editing
um and then i got back to cmu

1600
00:33:21,430 --> 00:33:21,440
um and then i got back to cmu
 

1601
00:33:21,440 --> 00:33:26,549
um and then i got back to cmu
where we had kind of one of everything

1602
00:33:26,549 --> 00:33:26,559
where we had kind of one of everything
 

1603
00:33:26,559 --> 00:33:29,590
where we had kind of one of everything
and two of a bunch of things and four of

1604
00:33:29,590 --> 00:33:29,600
and two of a bunch of things and four of
 

1605
00:33:29,600 --> 00:33:31,509
and two of a bunch of things and four of
a few things and

1606
00:33:31,509 --> 00:33:31,519
a few things and
 

1607
00:33:31,519 --> 00:33:34,630
a few things and
um since i mostly worked in the unix

1608
00:33:34,630 --> 00:33:34,640
um since i mostly worked in the unix
 

1609
00:33:34,640 --> 00:33:36,149
um since i mostly worked in the unix
universe

1610
00:33:36,149 --> 00:33:36,159
universe
 

1611
00:33:36,159 --> 00:33:39,190
universe
and unix didn't have an e-max i decided

1612
00:33:39,190 --> 00:33:39,200
and unix didn't have an e-max i decided
 

1613
00:33:39,200 --> 00:33:42,630
and unix didn't have an e-max i decided
that i needed to fix that problem

1614
00:33:42,630 --> 00:33:42,640
that i needed to fix that problem
 

1615
00:33:42,640 --> 00:33:45,509
that i needed to fix that problem
so i so i wrote this this implementation

1616
00:33:45,509 --> 00:33:45,519
so i so i wrote this this implementation
 

1617
00:33:45,519 --> 00:33:47,590
so i so i wrote this this implementation
of emacs in c

1618
00:33:47,590 --> 00:33:47,600
of emacs in c
 

1619
00:33:47,600 --> 00:33:49,909
of emacs in c
because at the time c was really the

1620
00:33:49,909 --> 00:33:49,919
because at the time c was really the
 

1621
00:33:49,919 --> 00:33:52,230
because at the time c was really the
only language that worked on

1622
00:33:52,230 --> 00:33:52,240
only language that worked on
 

1623
00:33:52,240 --> 00:33:55,350
only language that worked on
on uh on unix

1624
00:33:55,350 --> 00:33:55,360
on uh on unix
 

1625
00:33:55,360 --> 00:33:57,190
on uh on unix
um and you were comfortable with c as

1626
00:33:57,190 --> 00:33:57,200
um and you were comfortable with c as
 

1627
00:33:57,200 --> 00:33:59,269
um and you were comfortable with c as
well oh yeah at that point

1628
00:33:59,269 --> 00:33:59,279
well oh yeah at that point
 

1629
00:33:59,279 --> 00:34:01,430
well oh yeah at that point
yeah at that time i had done a lot of c

1630
00:34:01,430 --> 00:34:01,440
yeah at that time i had done a lot of c
 

1631
00:34:01,440 --> 00:34:04,870
yeah at that time i had done a lot of c
coding that this was in like 86.

1632
00:34:04,870 --> 00:34:04,880
coding that this was in like 86.
 

1633
00:34:04,880 --> 00:34:09,510
coding that this was in like 86.
um and

1634
00:34:09,510 --> 00:34:09,520

 

1635
00:34:09,520 --> 00:34:13,109

you know it was running well enough to

1636
00:34:13,109 --> 00:34:13,119
you know it was running well enough to
 

1637
00:34:13,119 --> 00:34:15,829
you know it was running well enough to
be used for me to use it to edit itself

1638
00:34:15,829 --> 00:34:15,839
be used for me to use it to edit itself
 

1639
00:34:15,839 --> 00:34:16,470
be used for me to use it to edit itself
within a

1640
00:34:16,470 --> 00:34:16,480
within a
 

1641
00:34:16,480 --> 00:34:20,790
within a
month or two and um then it kind of

1642
00:34:20,790 --> 00:34:20,800
month or two and um then it kind of
 

1643
00:34:20,800 --> 00:34:23,909
month or two and um then it kind of
took over the university and and it

1644
00:34:23,909 --> 00:34:23,919
took over the university and and it
 

1645
00:34:23,919 --> 00:34:24,550
took over the university and and it
spread

1646
00:34:24,550 --> 00:34:24,560
spread
 

1647
00:34:24,560 --> 00:34:26,389
spread
and then it died yeah and then it went

1648
00:34:26,389 --> 00:34:26,399
and then it died yeah and then it went
 

1649
00:34:26,399 --> 00:34:28,069
and then it died yeah and then it went
outside the

1650
00:34:28,069 --> 00:34:28,079

like
 

1777
00:37:19,760 --> 00:37:22,950
like
what's the big deal it's just a scale

1778
00:37:22,950 --> 00:37:22,960
what's the big deal it's just a scale
 

1779
00:37:22,960 --> 00:37:23,349
what's the big deal it's just a scale
thing

1780
00:37:23,349 --> 00:37:23,359
thing
 

1781
00:37:23,359 --> 00:37:26,550
thing
it's it's right the the scale thing is

1782
00:37:26,550 --> 00:37:26,560
it's it's right the the scale thing is
 

1783
00:37:26,560 --> 00:37:26,870
it's it's right the the scale thing is
just

1784
00:37:26,870 --> 00:37:26,880
just
 

1785
00:37:26,880 --> 00:37:30,390
just
astonishing yeah um but the fundamentals

1786
00:37:30,390 --> 00:37:30,400
astonishing yeah um but the fundamentals
 

1787
00:37:30,400 --> 00:37:33,510
astonishing yeah um but the fundamentals
um in some ways the fundamentals have

1788
00:37:33,510 --> 00:37:33,520
um in some ways the fundamentals have
 

1789
00:37:33,520 --> 00:37:36,870
um in some ways the fundamentals have
have hardly changed and

1790
00:37:36,870 --> 00:37:36,880
have hardly changed and
 

1791
00:37:36,880 --> 00:37:39,910
have hardly changed and
you know the the technologies behind the

1792
00:37:39,910 --> 00:37:39,920
you know the the technologies behind the
 

1793
00:37:39,920 --> 00:37:41,430
you know the the technologies behind the
the networking have changed

1794
00:37:41,430 --> 00:37:41,440
the networking have changed
 

1795
00:37:41,440 --> 00:37:43,829
the networking have changed
significantly the

1796
00:37:43,829 --> 00:37:43,839
significantly the
 

1797
00:37:43,839 --> 00:37:47,349
significantly the
you know the the the watershed moment of

1798
00:37:47,349 --> 00:37:47,359
you know the the the watershed moment of
 

1799
00:37:47,359 --> 00:37:49,670
you know the the the watershed moment of
you know going from the arpanet to the

1800
00:37:49,670 --> 00:37:49,680
you know going from the arpanet to the
 

1801
00:37:49,680 --> 00:37:51,190
you know going from the arpanet to the
internet

1802
00:37:51,190 --> 00:37:51,200
internet
 

1803
00:37:51,200 --> 00:37:55,589
internet
um and then people starting to just

1804
00:37:55,589 --> 00:37:55,599
um and then people starting to just
 

1805
00:37:55,599 --> 00:37:59,030
um and then people starting to just
scale and scale and scale i mean the

1806
00:37:59,030 --> 00:37:59,040
scale and scale and scale i mean the
 

1807
00:37:59,040 --> 00:38:02,470
scale and scale and scale i mean the
the the the scaling that happened in the

1808
00:38:02,470 --> 00:38:02,480
the the the scaling that happened in the
 

1809
00:38:02,480 --> 00:38:03,589
the the the scaling that happened in the
early 90s

1810
00:38:03,589 --> 00:38:03,599
early 90s
 

1811
00:38:03,599 --> 00:38:07,750
early 90s
and the way that

1812
00:38:07,750 --> 00:38:07,760
and the way that
 

1813
00:38:07,760 --> 00:38:10,550
and the way that

and they could see that
right they absolutely knew that the

2134
00:45:07,910 --> 00:45:07,920
right they absolutely knew that the
 

2135
00:45:07,920 --> 00:45:09,430
right they absolutely knew that the
problem is that you know

2136

2144
00:45:21,990 --> 00:45:22,000

 

2145
00:45:22,000 --> 00:45:25,670

um it never started to make sense for

2146
00:45:25,670 --> 00:45:25,680
um it never started to make sense for
 

2147
00:45:25,680 --> 00:45:26,870
um it never started to make sense for
them to

2148
00:45:26,870 --> 00:45:26,880
them to
 

2149
00:45:26,880 --> 00:45:30,069
them to
kind of lead the charge and

2150
00:45:30,069 --> 00:45:30,079
kind of lead the charge and
 

2151
00:45:30,079 --> 00:45:31,670
kind of lead the charge and
part of the issues for a lot of

2152
00:45:31,670 --> 00:45:31,680
part of the issues for a lot of
 

2153
00:45:31,680 --> 00:45:34,950
part of the issues for a lot of
companies for this kind of stuff

2154
00:45:34,950 --> 00:45:34,960
companies for this kind of stuff
 

2155
00:45:34,960 --> 00:45:37,349
companies for this kind of stuff
is that um you know if you're going to

2156
00:45:37,349 --> 00:45:37,359
is that um you know if you're going to
 

2157
00:45:37,359 --> 00:45:39,750
is that um you know if you're going to
leap over a chasm like that like like

2158
00:45:39,750 --> 00:45:39,760
leap over a chasm like that like like
 

2159
00:45:39,760 --> 00:45:40,550
leap over a chasm like that like like
with

2160
00:45:40,550 --> 00:45:40,560
with
 

2161
00:45:40,560 --> 00:45:45,750
with
kodak going from from film to digital

2162
00:45:45,750 --> 00:45:45,760
kodak going from from film to digital
 

2163
00:45:45,760 --> 00:45:47,270
kodak going from from film to digital
that's a transition that's going to take

2164
00:45:47,270 --> 00:45:47,280
that's a transition that's going to take
 

2165
00:45:47,280 --> 00:45:49,589
that's a transition that's going to take
a while

2166
00:45:49,589 --> 00:45:49,599
a while
 

2167
00:45:49,599 --> 00:45:51,270
a while
right we have we had fights like this

2168
00:45:51,270 --> 00:45:51,280
right we have we had fights like this
 

2169
00:45:51,280 --> 00:45:53,430
right we have we had fights like this
with people over like smart carts

2170
00:45:53,430 --> 00:45:53,440
with people over like smart carts
 

2171
00:45:53,440 --> 00:45:55,990
with people over like smart carts
the smart cards fights were just

2172
00:45:55,990 --> 00:45:56,000
the smart cards fights were just
 

2173
00:45:56,000 --> 00:45:57,670
the smart cards fights were just
ludicrous

2174
00:45:57,670 --> 00:45:57,680
ludicrous
 

2175
00:45:57,680 --> 00:45:59,270
ludicrous
but that's where visionary leadership

2176
00:45:59,270 --> 00:45:59,280
but that's where visionary leadership
 

2177
00:45:59,280 --> 00:46:00,710
but that's where visionary leadership
comes in right yeah somebody needs to

2178
00:46:00,710 --> 00:46:00,720
comes in right yeah somebody needs to
 

2179
00:46:00,720 --> 00:46:02,550
comes in right yeah somebody needs to
roll in and say

2180
00:46:02,550 --> 00:46:02,560
roll in and say
 

2181
00:46:02,560 --> 00:46:05,589
roll in and say
then take to take the leap well it's

2182
00:46:05,589 --> 00:46:05,599
then take to take the leap well it's
 

2183
00:46:05,599 --> 00:46:07,910
then take to take the leap well it's
it's partly take the leap but it's also

2184
00:46:07,910 --> 00:46:07,920
it's partly take the leap but it's also
 

2185
00:46:07,920 --> 00:46:09,430
it's partly take the leap but it's also
partly take the hit

2186
00:46:09,430 --> 00:46:09,440
partly take the hit
 

2187
00:46:09,440 --> 00:46:13,349
partly take the hit
take the hit right so so so so you can

2188
00:46:13,349 --> 00:46:13,359
take the hit right so so so so you can
 

2189
00:46:13,359 --> 00:46:16,150
take the hit right so so so so you can
draw all the graphs you want that show

2190
00:46:16,150 --> 00:46:16,160
draw all the graphs you want that show
 

2191
00:46:16,160 --> 00:46:18,470
draw all the graphs you want that show
that you know if we leap from here

2192
00:46:18,470 --> 00:46:18,480
that you know if we leap from here
 

2193
00:46:18,480 --> 00:46:19,910
that you know if we leap from here
you know you know the you know on our

2194
00:46:19,910 --> 00:46:19,920
you know you know the you know on our
 

2195
00:46:19,920 --> 00:46:21,510
you know you know the you know on our
present trajectory we're doing this and

2196
00:46:21,510 --> 00:46:21,520
present trajectory we're doing this and
 

2197
00:46:21,520 --> 00:46:22,950
present trajectory we're doing this and
there's a cliff

2198
00:46:22,950 --> 00:46:22,960
there's a cliff
 

2199
00:46:22,960 --> 00:46:26,950
there's a cliff
if we um force ourselves into it into a

2200
00:46:26,950 --> 00:46:26,960
if we um force ourselves into it into a
 

2201
00:46:26,960 --> 00:46:29,829
if we um force ourselves into it into a
transition and we proactively do that

2202
00:46:29,829 --> 00:46:29,839
transition and we proactively do that
 

2203
00:46:29,839 --> 00:46:33,670
transition and we proactively do that
we can be on the next wave

2204
00:46:33,670 --> 00:46:33,680
we can be on the next wave
 

2205
00:46:33,680 --> 00:46:36,309
we can be on the next wave
but there will be a period when we're in

2206
00:46:36,309 --> 00:46:36,319
but there will be a period when we're in
 

2207
00:46:36,319 --> 00:46:39,109
but there will be a period when we're in
a trough

2208
00:46:39,109 --> 00:46:39,119

 

2209
00:46:39,119 --> 00:46:42,550

and pretty much always there ends up

2210
00:46:42,550 --> 00:46:42,560
and pretty much always there ends up
 

2211
00:46:42,560 --> 00:46:46,069
and pretty much always there ends up
being a trough as you leave the chasm

2212
00:46:46,069 --> 00:46:46,079
being a trough as you leave the chasm
 

2213
00:46:46,079 --> 00:46:50,470
being a trough as you leave the chasm
but the way that public companies work

2214
00:46:50,470 --> 00:46:50,480
but the way that public companies work
 

2215
00:46:50,480 --> 00:46:54,390
but the way that public companies work
on this planet they're reporting

2216
00:46:54,390 --> 00:46:54,400
on this planet they're reporting
 

2217
00:46:54,400 --> 00:46:57,270
on this planet they're reporting
every quarter and the one thing that a

2218
00:46:57,270 --> 00:46:57,280
every quarter and the one thing that a

00:46:58,079 --> 00:47:01,270
ceo
must never do

00:47:01,270 --> 00:47:01,280
must never do
 

2223
00:47:01,280 --> 00:47:04,309
must never do
is take a big hit take a big hit

2224
00:47:04,309 --> 00:47:04,319
is take a big hit take a big hit
 

2225
00:47:04,319 --> 00:47:06,630
is take a big hit take a big hit
you know over some some quarter and and

2226
00:47:06,630 --> 00:47:06,640
you know over some some quarter and and
 

2227
00:47:06,640 --> 00:47:09,510
you know over some some quarter and and
many of these transitions

2228
00:47:09,510 --> 00:47:09,520
many of these transitions
 

2229
00:47:09,520 --> 00:47:12,870
many of these transitions
involve a big hit for a

2230
00:47:12,870 --> 00:47:12,880
involve a big hit for a
 

2231
00:47:12,880 --> 00:47:16,069
involve a big hit for a
a period of time you know one two three

2232
00:47:16,069 --> 00:47:16,079
a period of time you know one two three
 

2233
00:47:16,079 --> 00:47:17,349
a period of time you know one two three
quarters

2234
00:47:17,349 --> 00:47:17,359
quarters
 

2235
00:47:17,359 --> 00:47:20,390
quarters
and so you get

2236
00:47:20,390 --> 00:47:20,400
and so you get
 

2237
00:47:20,400 --> 00:47:24,390
and so you get
some companies and you know like

2238
00:47:24,390 --> 00:47:24,400
some companies and you know like
 

2239
00:47:24,400 --> 00:47:27,190
some companies and you know like
tesla and amazon are are really good

2240
00:47:27,190 --> 00:47:27,200
tesla and amazon are are really good
 

2241
00:47:27,200 --> 00:47:28,150
tesla and amazon are are really good
examples

2242
00:47:28,150 --> 00:47:28,160
examples
 

2243
00:47:28,160 --> 00:47:32,309
examples
of companies that take huge hits

2244
00:47:32,309 --> 00:47:32,319
of companies that take huge hits
 

2245
00:47:32,319 --> 00:47:34,470
of companies that take huge hits
but they have the luxury of being able

2246
00:47:34,470 --> 00:47:34,480
but they have the luxury of being able
 

2247
00:47:34,480 --> 00:47:36,870
but they have the luxury of being able
to ignore the stock market for a little

2248
00:47:36,870 --> 00:47:36,880
to ignore the stock market for a little
 

2249
00:47:36,880 --> 00:47:38,069
to ignore the stock market for a little
while

2250
00:47:38,069 --> 00:47:38,079
while
 

2251
00:47:38,079 --> 00:47:41,430
while
and that's not so true today

2252
00:47:41,430 --> 00:47:41,440
and that's not so true today
 

2253
00:47:41,440 --> 00:47:45,109
and that's not so true today
really but you know in the early days of

2254
00:47:45,109 --> 00:47:45,119
really but you know in the early days of
 

2255
00:47:45,119 --> 00:47:48,470
really but you know in the early days of
of both of those companies um

2256

amazon operated in the negative for a
 

2281
00:48:14,800 --> 00:48:16,549
amazon operated in the negative for a
long time it's like investing into the

future
 

2285
00:48:17,280 --> 00:48:20,390
future
right but you know you know so

2286
00:48:20,390 --> 00:48:20,400
right but you know you know so
 

2287
00:48:20,400 --> 00:48:23,510
right but you know you know so
amazon and google and tesla and facebook

2288
00:48:23,510 --> 00:48:23,520
amazon and google and tesla and facebook
 

2289
00:48:23,520 --> 00:48:25,589
amazon and google and tesla and facebook
a lot of those had

2290
00:48:25,589 --> 00:48:25,599
a lot of those had
 

2291
00:48:25,599 --> 00:48:29,829
a lot of those had
what it what amounted to patient money

2292
00:48:29,829 --> 00:48:29,839
what it what amounted to patient money
 

2293
00:48:29,839 --> 00:48:32,950
what it what amounted to patient money
um often because the there's there's

2294
00:48:32,950 --> 00:48:32,960
um often because the there's there's
 

2295
00:48:32,960 --> 00:48:34,309
um often because the there's there's
like a charismatic

2296
00:48:34,309 --> 00:48:34,319
like a charismatic
 

2297
00:48:34,319 --> 00:48:38,630
like a charismatic
central figure who has a really large

2298
00:48:38,630 --> 00:48:38,640
central figure who has a really large
 

2299
00:48:38,640 --> 00:48:41,030
central figure who has a really large
block of stock

2300
00:48:41,030 --> 00:48:41,040
block of stock
 

2301
00:48:41,040 --> 00:48:45,510
block of stock
and they can just make it so

2302
00:48:45,510 --> 00:48:45,520
and they can just make it so
 

2303
00:48:45,520 --> 00:48:48,309
and they can just make it so
so what uh on that topic just maybe it's

2304
00:48:48,309 --> 00:48:48,319
so what uh on that topic just maybe it's
 

2305
00:48:48,319 --> 00:48:50,150
so what uh on that topic just maybe it's
a little small tangent but uh

2306
00:48:50,150 --> 00:48:50,160
a little small tangent but uh
 

2307

00:56:04,789 --> 00:56:04,799
technologies but he also talked about
 

2631
00:56:04,799 --> 00:56:07,670
technologies but he also talked about
the jerkiness of some of the folks yeah

2632
00:56:07,670 --> 00:56:07,680
the jerkiness of some of the folks yeah
 

2633
00:56:07,680 --> 00:56:08,069
the jerkiness of some of the folks yeah
yeah

2634
00:56:08,069 --> 00:56:08,079
yeah
 

2635
00:56:08,079 --> 00:56:10,710
yeah
and the fact that being a jerk has

2636
00:56:10,710 --> 00:56:10,720
and the fact that being a jerk has
 

2637
00:56:10,720 --> 00:56:13,109
and the fact that being a jerk has
become your required style

2638
00:56:13,109 --> 00:56:13,119
become your required style
 

2639
00:56:13,119 --> 00:56:15,430
become your required style
but one thing i'd maybe want to ask on

2640
00:56:15,430 --> 00:56:15,440
but one thing i'd maybe want to ask on
 

2641
00:56:15,440 --> 00:56:17,349
but one thing i'd maybe want to ask on
that is and maybe to push back a little

2642
00:56:17,349 --> 00:56:17,359
that is and maybe to push back a little
 

2643
00:56:17,359 --> 00:56:17,670
that is and maybe to push back a little
bit

2644
00:56:17,670 --> 00:56:17,680
bit
 

2645
00:56:17,680 --> 00:56:19,829
bit
so there's the jerk side but there's

2646
00:56:19,829 --> 00:56:19,839
so there's the jerk side but there's
 

2647
00:56:19,839 --> 00:56:21,270
so there's the jerk side but there's
also

2648
00:56:21,270 --> 00:56:21,280
also
 

2649
00:56:21,280 --> 00:56:22,870
also
if i were to criticize what i've seen in

2650
00:56:22,870 --> 00:56:22,880
if i were to criticize what i've seen in
 

2651
00:56:22,880 --> 00:56:24,309
if i were to criticize what i've seen in
silicon valley

2652
00:56:24,309 --> 00:56:24,319
silicon valley
 

2653
00:56:24,319 --> 00:56:25,990
silicon valley
which is almost the resistance to

2654
00:56:25,990 --> 00:56:26,000
which is almost the resistance to
 

2655
00:56:26,000 --> 00:56:28,309
which is almost the resistance to
working hard

2656
00:56:28,309 --> 00:56:28,319
working hard
 

2657
00:56:28,319 --> 00:56:34,069
working hard
so on the jerkiness side is um

2658
00:56:34,069 --> 00:56:34,079

 

2659
00:56:34,079 --> 00:56:37,589

it's it's so posted jobs and elon kind

2660
00:56:37,589 --> 00:56:37,599
it's it's so posted jobs and elon kind
 

2661
00:56:37,599 --> 00:56:38,710
it's it's so posted jobs and elon kind
of push people

2662
00:56:38,710 --> 00:56:38,720
of push people
 

2663
00:56:38,720 --> 00:56:41,829
of push people
to work really hard to do

2664
00:56:41,829 --> 00:56:41,839
to work really hard to do
 

2665
00:56:41,839 --> 00:56:43,829
to work really hard to do
and there's a question whether it's

2666
00:56:43,829 --> 00:56:43,839
and there's a question whether it's
 

2667
00:56:43,839 --> 00:56:45,829
and there's a question whether it's
possible to do that nicely

2668
00:56:45,829 --> 00:56:45,839
possible to do that nicely
 

2669
00:56:45,839 --> 00:56:47,510
possible to do that nicely
but one of the things that bothers me

2670
00:56:47,510 --> 00:56:47,520
but one of the things that bothers me
 

2671
00:56:47,520 --> 00:56:48,870
but one of the things that bothers me
maybe i'm just

2672
00:56:48,870 --> 00:56:48,880
maybe i'm just
 

2673
00:56:48,880 --> 00:56:51,030
maybe i'm just
rushing and just kind of you know

2674
00:56:51,030 --> 00:56:51,040
rushing and just kind of you know
 

2675
00:56:51,040 --> 00:56:53,270
rushing and just kind of you know
romanticize the whole suffering thing

2676
00:56:53,270 --> 00:56:53,280
romanticize the whole suffering thing
 

2677
00:56:53,280 --> 00:56:56,470
romanticize the whole suffering thing
but i think working hard is essential

2678
00:56:56,470 --> 00:56:56,480
but i think working hard is essential
 

2679
00:56:56,480 --> 00:56:58,789
but i think working hard is essential
for accomplishing anything interesting

2680
00:56:58,789 --> 00:56:58,799
for accomplishing anything interesting
 

2681
00:56:58,799 --> 00:57:01,910
for accomplishing anything interesting
like really hard and in the parlance of

2682
00:57:01,910 --> 00:57:01,920
like really hard and in the parlance of
 

2683
00:57:01,920 --> 00:57:04,710
like really hard and in the parlance of
silicon valley it's probably too hard

2684
00:57:04,710 --> 00:57:04,720
silicon valley it's probably too hard
 

2685
00:57:04,720 --> 00:57:06,549
silicon valley it's probably too hard
this idea that you should work smart not

2686
00:57:06,549 --> 00:57:06,559
this idea that you should work smart not
 

2687
00:57:06,559 --> 00:57:07,430
this idea that you should work smart not
hard

2688
00:57:07,430 --> 00:57:07,440
hard
 

2689
00:57:07,440 --> 00:57:11,670
hard
often to me it sounds like you should be

2690
00:57:11,670 --> 00:57:11,680
often to me it sounds like you should be
 

2691
00:57:11,680 --> 00:57:12,710
often to me it sounds like you should be
lazy

2692
00:57:12,710 --> 00:57:12,720
lazy
 

2693
00:57:12,720 --> 00:57:14,789
lazy
because of course you want to be to work

2694
00:57:14,789 --> 00:57:14,799
because of course you want to be to work
 

2695
00:57:14,799 --> 00:57:16,630
because of course you want to be to work
smart of course you want to be

2696
00:57:16,630 --> 00:57:16,640
smart of course you want to be
 

2697
00:57:16,640 --> 00:57:18,710
smart of course you want to be
maximally efficient but in order to

2698
00:57:18,710 --> 00:57:18,720
maximally efficient but in order to
 

2699
00:57:18,720 --> 00:57:20,390
maximally efficient but in order to
discover the efficient path like we're

2700
00:57:20,390 --> 00:57:20,400
discover the efficient path like we're
 

2701
00:57:20,400 --> 00:57:21,990
discover the efficient path like we're
talking about with the short programs

2702
00:57:21,990 --> 00:57:22,000
talking about with the short programs
 

2703
00:57:22,000 --> 00:57:26,069
talking about with the short programs
yeah well you know the the the smart

that's that's just just a recipe for
 

2723
00:57:49,119 --> 00:57:50,150
that's that's just just a recipe for
disaster i mean there

disaster i mean there
 

2725
00:57:50,160 --> 00:57:53,430
disaster i mean there
are there are counter examples

are there are counter examples
 

2727
00:57:53,440 --> 00:57:56,549
are there are counter examples
but they're more people who benefited

2728

like issues um

2796
00:59:13,910 --> 00:59:13,920

 

2797
00:59:13,920 --> 00:59:17,510

the entire mess like what's about open
source now in retrospect looking back

2802
00:59:23,270 --> 00:59:23,280
source now in retrospect looking back
 

2803
00:59:23,280 --> 00:59:26,950
source now in retrospect looking back
uh about licensing about open sourcing

2804
00:59:26,950 --> 00:59:26,960
uh about licensing about open sourcing
 

2805
00:59:26,960 --> 00:59:30,789
uh about licensing about open sourcing
do you think uh open source is a good

2806
00:59:30,789 --> 00:59:30,799
do you think uh open source is a good
 

2807
00:59:30,799 --> 00:59:31,270
do you think uh open source is a good
thing

2808

a bad thing do you have regrets
 

2811
00:59:35,520 --> 00:59:37,910
a bad thing do you have regrets
do you have wisdom that you've learned

2812
00:59:37,910 --> 00:59:37,920
do you have wisdom that you've learned
 

2813
00:59:37,920 --> 00:59:39,829
do you have wisdom that you've learned
from that whole experience

2814
00:59:39,829 --> 00:59:39,839
from that whole experience
 

2815
00:59:39,839 --> 00:59:43,510
from that whole experience
so in general i'm a big fan of of open

2816
00:59:43,510 --> 00:59:43,520
so in general i'm a big fan of of open
 

2817
00:59:43,520 --> 00:59:45,270
so in general i'm a big fan of of open
source

2818
00:59:45,270 --> 00:59:45,280
source
 

2819
00:59:45,280 --> 00:59:48,309
source
the way that it it can be used to build

2820
00:59:48,309 --> 00:59:48,319
the way that it it can be used to build
 

2821
00:59:48,319 --> 00:59:49,109
the way that it it can be used to build
communities

2822
00:59:49,109 --> 00:59:49,119
communities
 

2823
00:59:49,119 --> 00:59:51,910
communities

00:59:57,200 --> 01:00:01,030
and all of that is really pretty grand
um when

2830
01:00:01,030 --> 01:00:01,040
um when
 

2831
01:00:01,040 --> 01:00:03,430
um when
open source turns into a religion that

2832
01:00:03,430 --> 01:00:03,440
open source turns into a religion that
 

2833
01:00:03,440 --> 01:00:05,510
open source turns into a religion that
says all things must be open source

2834
01:00:05,510 --> 01:00:05,520
says all things must be open source
 

2835
01:00:05,520 --> 01:00:06,630
says all things must be open source
right

2836
01:00:06,630 --> 01:00:06,640
right
 

2837
01:00:06,640 --> 01:00:09,750
right
um i get kind of

2838

um i get kind of
 

2839
01:00:09,760 --> 01:00:11,670
um i get kind of
weird about that because it's it's sort

2840
01:00:11,670 --> 01:00:11,680
weird about that because it's it's sort
 

2841
01:00:11,680 --> 01:00:13,109
weird about that because it's it's sort
of like saying

2842
01:00:13,109 --> 01:00:13,119
of like saying
 

2843
01:00:13,119 --> 01:00:17,510
of like saying
you know some some versions of that um

2844
01:00:17,510 --> 01:00:17,520
you know some some versions of that um
 

2845
01:00:17,520 --> 01:00:21,030
you know some some versions of that um
end up saying that that that all

2846
01:00:21,030 --> 01:00:21,040
end up saying that that that all
 

2847
01:00:21,040 --> 01:00:22,950
end up saying that that that all
all software engineers must take a vow

2848
01:00:22,950 --> 01:00:22,960
all software engineers must take a vow
 

2849
01:00:22,960 --> 01:00:24,390
all software engineers must take a vow
of poverty

2850
01:00:24,390 --> 01:00:24,400
of poverty
 

2851
01:00:24,400 --> 01:00:27,990
of poverty
right right as though um

2852
01:00:27,990 --> 01:00:28,000
right right as though um
 

2853
01:00:28,000 --> 01:00:31,430
right right as though um
it's unethical to have money yeah

2854
01:00:31,430 --> 01:00:31,440
it's unethical to have money yeah
 

2855
01:00:31,440 --> 01:00:34,470
it's unethical to have money yeah
to build a company to uh right

2856
01:00:34,470 --> 01:00:34,480
to build a company to uh right
 

2857
01:00:34,480 --> 01:00:37,349
to build a company to uh right
and you know there's a there's a there's

2858
01:00:37,349 --> 01:00:37,359
and you know there's a there's a there's
 

2859
01:00:37,359 --> 01:00:37,829
and you know there's a there's a there's
a

2860
01:00:37,829 --> 01:00:37,839
a
 

2861
01:00:37,839 --> 01:00:39,829
a
slice of me that actually kind of buys

2862
01:00:39,829 --> 01:00:39,839
slice of me that actually kind of buys
 

2863
01:00:39,839 --> 01:00:41,190
slice of me that actually kind of buys
into that right

2864
01:00:41,190 --> 01:00:41,200
into that right
 

2865
01:00:41,200 --> 01:00:45,109
into that right
because you know people who make

2866
01:00:45,109 --> 01:00:45,119
because you know people who make
 

2867
01:00:45,119 --> 01:00:50,069
because you know people who make
billions of dollars off of like a patent

2868
01:00:50,069 --> 01:00:50,079
billions of dollars off of like a patent
 

2869
01:00:50,079 --> 01:00:53,109
billions of dollars off of like a patent
and the the patent came from like you

2870
01:00:53,109 --> 01:00:53,119
and the the patent came from like you
 

2871
01:00:53,119 --> 01:00:54,710
and the the patent came from like you
know literally a

2872
01:00:54,710 --> 01:00:54,720
know literally a
 

2873
01:00:54,720 --> 01:00:58,069
know literally a
a stroke of lightning that that

2874
01:00:58,069 --> 01:00:58,079
a stroke of lightning that that
 

2875
01:00:58,079 --> 01:01:02,390
a stroke of lightning that that
hits you as you lie half a week in bed

2876
01:01:02,390 --> 01:01:02,400
hits you as you lie half a week in bed
 

2877
01:01:02,400 --> 01:01:05,990
hits you as you lie half a week in bed
yeah that's lucky good for you

2878
01:01:05,990 --> 01:01:06,000
yeah that's lucky good for you
 

2879
01:01:06,000 --> 01:01:08,870
yeah that's lucky good for you
the way that that sometimes sort of

2880
01:01:08,870 --> 01:01:08,880
the way that that sometimes sort of
 

2881
01:01:08,880 --> 01:01:10,549
the way that that sometimes sort of
explodes into

2882
01:01:10,549 --> 01:01:10,559
explodes into
 

2883
01:01:10,559 --> 01:01:12,150
explodes into
something that looks to me a lot like

2884
01:01:12,150 --> 01:01:12,160
something that looks to me a lot like
 

2885
01:01:12,160 --> 01:01:13,990
something that looks to me a lot like
exploitation

2886
01:01:13,990 --> 01:01:14,000
exploitation
 

2887
01:01:14,000 --> 01:01:16,309
exploitation
you know you see a lot of that in in in

2888
01:01:16,309 --> 01:01:16,319
you know you see a lot of that in in in
 

2889
01:01:16,319 --> 01:01:17,589
you know you see a lot of that in in in
like the

2890
01:01:17,589 --> 01:01:17,599
like the
 

2891
01:01:17,599 --> 01:01:21,910
like the
the drug industry um

2892
01:01:21,910 --> 01:01:21,920
the drug industry um
 

2893
01:01:21,920 --> 01:01:25,510
the drug industry um
you know when you know when you've got a

2894
01:01:25,510 --> 01:01:25,520
you know when you know when you've got a
 

2895
01:01:25,520 --> 01:01:28,710
you know when you know when you've got a
got got medications that cost

2896
01:01:28,710 --> 01:01:28,720
got got medications that cost
 

2897
01:01:28,720 --> 01:01:30,470
got got medications that cost
you know cost you like a hundred dollars

2898
01:01:30,470 --> 01:01:30,480
you know cost you like a hundred dollars
 

2899
01:01:30,480 --> 01:01:31,910
you know cost you like a hundred dollars
a day

2900
01:01:31,910 --> 01:01:31,920
a day
 

2901
01:01:31,920 --> 01:01:36,789
a day
and it's like no

2902
01:01:36,789 --> 01:01:36,799
and it's like no
 

2903
01:01:36,799 --> 01:01:39,190
and it's like no
yeah so the the interesting thing about

2904
01:01:39,190 --> 01:01:39,200
yeah so the the interesting thing about
 

2905
01:01:39,200 --> 01:01:39,910
yeah so the the interesting thing about
the sort of

2906
01:01:39,910 --> 01:01:39,920
the sort of
 

2907
01:01:39,920 --> 01:01:44,789
the sort of
open source uh what bothers me is when

2908
01:01:44,789 --> 01:01:44,799
open source uh what bothers me is when
 

2909
01:01:44,799 --> 01:01:47,829
open source uh what bothers me is when
something is not open source and because

2910
01:01:47,829 --> 01:01:47,839
something is not open source and because
 

2911
01:01:47,839 --> 01:01:48,549
something is not open source and because
of that

2912
01:01:48,549 --> 01:01:48,559
of that
 

2913
01:01:48,559 --> 01:01:51,670
of that
it's a worse product yeah

2914
01:01:51,670 --> 01:01:51,680
it's a worse product yeah
 

2915
01:01:51,680 --> 01:01:54,630
it's a worse product yeah
so like i mean if i look at your just

2916
01:01:54,630 --> 01:01:54,640
so like i mean if i look at your just
 

2917
01:01:54,640 --> 01:01:56,549
so like i mean if i look at your just
implementation of emacs

2918
01:01:56,549 --> 01:01:56,559
implementation of emacs
 

2919
01:01:56,559 --> 01:01:58,470
implementation of emacs
like that could have been the dominant

2920
01:01:58,470 --> 01:01:58,480
like that could have been the dominant
 

2921
01:01:58,480 --> 01:02:00,069
like that could have been the dominant
implementation like i use emacs that's

2922
01:02:00,069 --> 01:02:00,079
implementation like i use emacs that's
 

2923
01:02:00,079 --> 01:02:01,109
implementation like i use emacs that's
my main id

2924
01:02:01,109 --> 01:02:01,119
my main id
 

2925
01:02:01,119 --> 01:02:02,789
my main id
i apologize to the world but i still

2926
01:02:02,789 --> 01:02:02,799
i apologize to the world but i still
 

2927
01:02:02,799 --> 01:02:04,950
i apologize to the world but i still
love it uh

2928
01:02:04,950 --> 01:02:04,960
love it uh
 

2929
01:02:04,960 --> 01:02:09,270
love it uh
and you know i could have been using um

2930
01:02:09,270 --> 01:02:09,280
and you know i could have been using um
 

2931
01:02:09,280 --> 01:02:12,230
and you know i could have been using um
your implementation of emacs and why

2932
01:02:12,230 --> 01:02:12,240
your implementation of emacs and why
 

2933
01:02:12,240 --> 01:02:13,750
your implementation of emacs and why
aren't i

2934
01:02:13,750 --> 01:02:13,760
aren't i
 

2935
01:02:13,760 --> 01:02:16,950
aren't i
so are you using the gnu max i guess the

2936
01:02:16,950 --> 01:02:16,960
so are you using the gnu max i guess the
 

2937
01:02:16,960 --> 01:02:18,870
so are you using the gnu max i guess the
default on linux is that new yeah

2938
01:02:18,870 --> 01:02:18,880
default on linux is that new yeah
 

2939
01:02:18,880 --> 01:02:22,630
default on linux is that new yeah
and and that through a strange passage

2940
01:02:22,630 --> 01:02:22,640
and and that through a strange passage
 

2941
01:02:22,640 --> 01:02:24,470
and and that through a strange passage
started out as the one that i wrote

2942
01:02:24,470 --> 01:02:24,480
started out as the one that i wrote
 

2943
01:02:24,480 --> 01:02:27,430
started out as the one that i wrote
exactly so it's it still has uh

2944
01:02:27,430 --> 01:02:27,440
exactly so it's it still has uh
 

2945
01:02:27,440 --> 01:02:29,910
exactly so it's it still has uh
right yeah right well and and part of

2946
01:02:29,910 --> 01:02:29,920
right yeah right well and and part of
 

2947
01:02:29,920 --> 01:02:30,710
right yeah right well and and part of
that was

2948
01:02:30,710 --> 01:02:30,720
that was
 

2949
01:02:30,720 --> 01:02:34,710
that was
because you know in you know the last

2950
01:02:34,710 --> 01:02:34,720
because you know in you know the last
 

2951
01:02:34,720 --> 01:02:39,029
because you know in you know the last
couple of years of grad school

2952
01:02:39,029 --> 01:02:39,039
couple of years of grad school
 

2953
01:02:39,039 --> 01:02:42,630
couple of years of grad school
it it became really clear to me

2954
01:02:42,630 --> 01:02:42,640
it it became really clear to me
 

2955

that just doesn't work for me either

3288
01:10:26,310 --> 01:10:26,320
that just doesn't work for me either
 

3289

so long time ago at sun in about 1990

3322
01:11:07,270 --> 01:11:07,280
so long time ago at sun in about 1990
 

3323
01:11:07,280 --> 01:11:07,990
so long time ago at sun in about 1990
there was a

3324
01:11:07,990 --> 01:11:08,000
there was a
 

3325
01:11:08,000 --> 01:11:11,510
there was a
group of us who

3326
01:11:11,510 --> 01:11:11,520
group of us who
 

3327
01:11:11,520 --> 01:11:14,550
group of us who
were kind of worried that there was

3328
01:11:14,550 --> 01:11:14,560
were kind of worried that there was
 

3329
01:11:14,560 --> 01:11:15,990
were kind of worried that there was
stuff going on

3330
01:11:15,990 --> 01:11:16,000
stuff going on
 

3331
01:11:16,000 --> 01:11:18,870
stuff going on
in the universe of computing that the

3332
01:11:18,870 --> 01:11:18,880
in the universe of computing that the
 

3333
01:11:18,880 --> 01:11:25,110
in the universe of computing that the
computing industry was missing out on

3334
01:11:25,110 --> 01:11:25,120

 

3335
01:11:25,120 --> 01:11:28,550

and so a a few of us

3336
01:11:28,550 --> 01:11:28,560
and so a a few of us
 

3337
01:11:28,560 --> 01:11:31,669
and so a a few of us
started this project at sun that really

3338
01:11:31,669 --> 01:11:31,679
started this project at sun that really
 

3339
01:11:31,679 --> 01:11:33,430
started this project at sun that really
got going i mean we started talking

3340
01:11:33,430 --> 01:11:33,440
got going i mean we started talking
 

3341
01:11:33,440 --> 01:11:35,750
got going i mean we started talking
about it in 1990 and it really got going

3342
01:11:35,750 --> 01:11:35,760
about it in 1990 and it really got going
 

3343
01:11:35,760 --> 01:11:38,950
about it in 1990 and it really got going
in 91

3344
01:11:38,950 --> 01:11:38,960

 

3345
01:11:38,960 --> 01:11:42,470

and it was all about

3346
01:11:42,470 --> 01:11:42,480

 

3347
01:11:42,480 --> 01:11:46,149

you know what was happening in terms of

3348
01:11:46,149 --> 01:11:46,159
you know what was happening in terms of
 

3349
01:11:46,159 --> 01:11:47,990
you know what was happening in terms of
you know computing hardware you know

3350
01:11:47,990 --> 01:11:48,000
you know computing hardware you know
 

3351
01:11:48,000 --> 01:11:49,669
you know computing hardware you know
processors and

3352
01:11:49,669 --> 01:11:49,679
processors and
 

3353
01:11:49,679 --> 01:11:52,310
processors and
networking and all of that that was

3354
01:11:52,310 --> 01:11:52,320
networking and all of that that was
 

3355
01:11:52,320 --> 01:11:54,310
networking and all of that that was
outside of the computer industry and

3356
01:11:54,310 --> 01:11:54,320
outside of the computer industry and
 

3357
01:11:54,320 --> 01:11:54,950
outside of the computer industry and
that was

3358
01:11:54,950 --> 01:11:54,960
that was
 

3359
01:11:54,960 --> 01:11:58,229
that was
everything from the the

3360
01:11:58,229 --> 01:11:58,239
everything from the the
 

3361
01:11:58,239 --> 01:12:00,709
everything from the the
the the sort of early glimmers of cell

3362
01:12:00,709 --> 01:12:00,719
the the sort of early glimmers of cell
 

3363
01:12:00,719 --> 01:12:02,070
the the sort of early glimmers of cell
phones that were happening

3364
01:12:02,070 --> 01:12:02,080
phones that were happening
 

3365
01:12:02,080 --> 01:12:05,990
phones that were happening
then to you know you look at elevators

3366
01:12:05,990 --> 01:12:06,000
then to you know you look at elevators
 

3367
01:12:06,000 --> 01:12:06,830
then to you know you look at elevators
and

3368
01:12:06,830 --> 01:12:06,840
and
 

3369
01:12:06,840 --> 01:12:09,830
and
locomotives and

3370
01:12:09,830 --> 01:12:09,840
locomotives and
 

3371
01:12:09,840 --> 01:12:14,310
locomotives and
process control systems in factories and

3372
01:12:14,310 --> 01:12:14,320
process control systems in factories and
 

3373
01:12:14,320 --> 01:12:17,510
process control systems in factories and
all kinds of audio audio

3374
01:12:17,510 --> 01:12:17,520
all kinds of audio audio
 

3375
01:12:17,520 --> 01:12:20,709
all kinds of audio audio
equipment and video equipment

3376
01:12:20,709 --> 01:12:20,719
equipment and video equipment
 

3377
01:12:20,719 --> 01:12:22,390
equipment and video equipment
they all had processors in them and they

3378
01:12:22,390 --> 01:12:22,400
they all had processors in them and they
 

3379
01:12:22,400 --> 01:12:24,870
they all had processors in them and they
were all doing stuff with them

3380
01:12:24,870 --> 01:12:24,880
were all doing stuff with them
 

3381
01:12:24,880 --> 01:12:28,550
were all doing stuff with them
and and it and it sort of felt like

3382
01:12:28,550 --> 01:12:28,560
and and it and it sort of felt like
 

3383
01:12:28,560 --> 01:12:30,870
and and it and it sort of felt like
there was something going on there that

3384
01:12:30,870 --> 01:12:30,880
there was something going on there that
 

3385
01:12:30,880 --> 01:12:34,830
there was something going on there that
we needed to understand

3386
01:12:34,830 --> 01:12:34,840

 

3387
01:12:34,840 --> 01:12:37,910

and so c c and c plus plus was in the

3388
01:12:37,910 --> 01:12:37,920
and so c c and c plus plus was in the
 

3389
01:12:37,920 --> 01:12:38,310
and so c c and c plus plus was in the
air

3390
01:12:38,310 --> 01:12:38,320
air
 

3391
01:12:38,320 --> 01:12:40,550
air
already oh no c and c plus plus

3392
01:12:40,550 --> 01:12:40,560
already oh no c and c plus plus
 

3393
01:12:40,560 --> 01:12:42,550
already oh no c and c plus plus
absolutely owned the universe at that

3394
01:12:42,550 --> 01:12:42,560
absolutely owned the universe at that
 

3395
01:12:42,560 --> 01:12:43,030
absolutely owned the universe at that
time

3396
01:12:43,030 --> 01:12:43,040
time
 

3397
01:12:43,040 --> 01:12:44,709
time
everything was written in c and z plus

3398
01:12:44,709 --> 01:12:44,719
everything was written in c and z plus
 

3399
01:12:44,719 --> 01:12:46,790
everything was written in c and z plus
plus so where was the hunch that there

3400
01:12:46,790 --> 01:12:46,800
plus so where was the hunch that there
 

3401
01:12:46,800 --> 01:12:48,790
plus so where was the hunch that there
was a need for a revolution

3402
01:12:48,790 --> 01:12:48,800
was a need for a revolution
 

3403
01:12:48,800 --> 01:12:50,630
was a need for a revolution
well so the the need for a revolution

3404
01:12:50,630 --> 01:12:50,640
well so the the need for a revolution
 

3405
01:12:50,640 --> 01:12:51,830
well so the the need for a revolution
was not about

3406
01:12:51,830 --> 01:12:51,840
was not about
 

3407
01:12:51,840 --> 01:12:56,229
was not about
the a language it was about

3408
01:12:56,229 --> 01:12:56,239
the a language it was about
 

3409
01:12:56,239 --> 01:12:59,590
the a language it was about
it was just as simple and vague as

3410
01:12:59,590 --> 01:12:59,600
it was just as simple and vague as
 

3411
01:12:59,600 --> 01:13:03,590
it was just as simple and vague as
there are things happening out there

3412
01:13:03,590 --> 01:13:03,600
there are things happening out there
 

3413
01:13:03,600 --> 01:13:05,430
there are things happening out there
and we understand them we need to

3414
01:13:05,430 --> 01:13:05,440
and we understand them we need to
 

3415
01:13:05,440 --> 01:13:07,669
and we understand them we need to
understand them

3416
01:13:07,669 --> 01:13:07,679
understand them
 

3417
01:13:07,679 --> 01:13:10,709
understand them
and and so um

3418
01:13:10,709 --> 01:13:10,719
and and so um
 

3419
01:13:10,719 --> 01:13:14,709
and and so um
a few of us went on several

3420
01:13:14,709 --> 01:13:14,719
a few of us went on several
 

3421
01:13:14,719 --> 01:13:18,790
a few of us went on several
um somewhat epic road trips

3422
01:13:18,790 --> 01:13:18,800
um somewhat epic road trips
 

3423
01:13:18,800 --> 01:13:21,750
um somewhat epic road trips
um literal road trips literal road trips

3424
01:13:21,750 --> 01:13:21,760
um literal road trips literal road trips
 

3425
01:13:21,760 --> 01:13:23,270
um literal road trips literal road trips
it's like get on an airplane

3426
01:13:23,270 --> 01:13:23,280
it's like get on an airplane

01:13:50,080 --> 01:13:51,910
you know a bunch of korean companies and
we went all over europe we went to you

3448
01:13:51,910 --> 01:13:51,920
we went all over europe we went to you
 

3449
01:13:51,920 --> 01:13:53,030
we went all over europe we went to you
know

3450
01:13:53,030 --> 01:13:53,040
know
 

3451
01:13:53,040 --> 01:13:55,590
know
places like like phillips and siemens

3452
01:13:55,590 --> 01:13:55,600
places like like phillips and siemens
 

3453
01:13:55,600 --> 01:13:56,550
places like like phillips and siemens
and thompson

3454
01:13:56,550 --> 01:13:56,560
and thompson
 

3455
01:13:56,560 --> 01:13:59,669
and thompson
and what did you see there

3456
01:13:59,669 --> 01:13:59,679
and what did you see there
 

3457
01:13:59,679 --> 01:14:01,669
and what did you see there
you know for me the one of the things

3458
01:14:01,669 --> 01:14:01,679
you know for me the one of the things
 

3459
01:14:01,679 --> 01:14:03,030
you know for me the one of the things
that sort of left out

3460
01:14:03,030 --> 01:14:03,040
that sort of left out
 

3461
01:14:03,040 --> 01:14:05,830
that sort of left out
was that they were doing all the usual

3462
01:14:05,830 --> 01:14:05,840
was that they were doing all the usual
 

3463
01:14:05,840 --> 01:14:06,390
was that they were doing all the usual
computer

3464
01:14:06,390 --> 01:14:06,400
computer
 

3465
01:14:06,400 --> 01:14:08,070
computer
computer things that people had been

3466
01:14:08,070 --> 01:14:08,080
computer things that people had been
 

3467
01:14:08,080 --> 01:14:10,470
computer things that people had been
doing like 20 years before

3468
01:14:10,470 --> 01:14:10,480
doing like 20 years before
 

3469
01:14:10,480 --> 01:14:13,350
doing like 20 years before
the thing that really left out to me was

3470
01:14:13,350 --> 01:14:13,360
the thing that really left out to me was
 

3471
01:14:13,360 --> 01:14:15,189
the thing that really left out to me was
that they were

3472
01:14:15,189 --> 01:14:15,199
that they were
 

3473
01:14:15,199 --> 01:14:18,870
that they were
sort of reinventing computer networking

3474
01:14:18,870 --> 01:14:18,880
sort of reinventing computer networking
 

3475
01:14:18,880 --> 01:14:21,910
sort of reinventing computer networking
and they were making

3476
01:14:21,910 --> 01:14:21,920
and they were making
 

3477
01:14:21,920 --> 01:14:25,270
and they were making
all the mistakes that people in the

3478
01:14:25,270 --> 01:14:25,280
all the mistakes that people in the
 

3479
01:14:25,280 --> 01:14:26,790
all the mistakes that people in the
computer industry

3480
01:14:26,790 --> 01:14:26,800
computer industry
 

3481
01:14:26,800 --> 01:14:29,990
computer industry
had had made and since i had been doing

3482
01:14:29,990 --> 01:14:30,000
had had made and since i had been doing
 

3483
01:14:30,000 --> 01:14:31,110
had had made and since i had been doing
a lot of work in

3484
01:14:31,110 --> 01:14:31,120
a lot of work in
 

3485
01:14:31,120 --> 01:14:34,070
a lot of work in
in the networking area you know you know

3486
01:14:34,070 --> 01:14:34,080
in the networking area you know you know
 

3487
01:14:34,080 --> 01:14:34,790
in the networking area you know you know
we'd go and

3488
01:14:34,790 --> 01:14:34,800
we'd go and
 

3489
01:14:34,800 --> 01:14:37,350
we'd go and
you know visit you know company x they'd

3490
01:14:37,350 --> 01:14:37,360
you know visit you know company x they'd
 

3491
01:14:37,360 --> 01:14:39,350
you know visit you know company x they'd
describe this networking thing that they

3492
01:14:39,350 --> 01:14:39,360
describe this networking thing that they
 

3493
01:14:39,360 --> 01:14:40,550
describe this networking thing that they
were doing

3494
01:14:40,550 --> 01:14:40,560
were doing
 

3495
01:14:40,560 --> 01:14:42,630
were doing
and just without any thought i could i

3496
01:14:42,630 --> 01:14:42,640
and just without any thought i could i
 

3497
01:14:42,640 --> 01:14:45,270
and just without any thought i could i
could tell them like the 25 things

3498
01:14:45,270 --> 01:14:45,280
could tell them like the 25 things
 

3499
01:14:45,280 --> 01:14:46,709
could tell them like the 25 things
there were going to be complete

3500
01:14:46,709 --> 01:14:46,719
there were going to be complete
 

3501
01:14:46,719 --> 01:14:49,430
there were going to be complete
disasters with that thing that they were

3502
01:14:49,430 --> 01:14:49,440
disasters with that thing that they were
 

3503
01:14:49,440 --> 01:14:50,790
disasters with that thing that they were
doing

3504
01:14:50,790 --> 01:14:50,800
doing
 

3505
01:14:50,800 --> 01:14:54,630
doing
um and i don't know whether that had any

3506
01:14:54,630 --> 01:14:54,640
um and i don't know whether that had any
 

3507
01:14:54,640 --> 01:14:56,149
um and i don't know whether that had any
impact on any of them but but

3508
01:14:56,149 --> 01:14:56,159
impact on any of them but but
 

3509
01:14:56,159 --> 01:14:59,510
impact on any of them but but
but that particular story of you know

3510
01:14:59,510 --> 01:14:59,520
but that particular story of you know
 

3511
01:14:59,520 --> 01:15:03,189
but that particular story of you know
sort of repeating the disasters

3512
01:15:03,189 --> 01:15:03,199
sort of repeating the disasters
 

3513
01:15:03,199 --> 01:15:06,950
sort of repeating the disasters
of the computer science industry um

3514
01:15:06,950 --> 01:15:06,960
of the computer science industry um
 

3515
01:15:06,960 --> 01:15:08,790
of the computer science industry um
was there and we and one of the things

3516
01:15:08,790 --> 01:15:08,800
was there and we and one of the things
 

3517
01:15:08,800 --> 01:15:11,030
was there and we and one of the things
we thought was

3518
01:15:11,030 --> 01:15:11,040
we thought was
 

3519
01:15:11,040 --> 01:15:12,630
we thought was
well maybe we could do something useful

3520
01:15:12,630 --> 01:15:12,640
well maybe we could do something useful
 

3521
01:15:12,640 --> 01:15:14,870
well maybe we could do something useful
here with like

3522
01:15:14,870 --> 01:15:14,880
here with like
 

3523
01:15:14,880 --> 01:15:17,270
here with like
bringing them forward somewhat but but

3524
01:15:17,270 --> 01:15:17,280
bringing them forward somewhat but but
 

3525
01:15:17,280 --> 01:15:18,709
bringing them forward somewhat but but
also

3526
01:15:18,709 --> 01:15:18,719
also
 

3527
01:15:18,719 --> 01:15:22,830
also
at the same time we learned a bunch of

3528
01:15:22,830 --> 01:15:22,840
at the same time we learned a bunch of
 

3529
01:15:22,840 --> 01:15:24,229
at the same time we learned a bunch of
things

3530
01:15:24,229 --> 01:15:24,239
things
 

3531
01:15:24,239 --> 01:15:27,830
things
from from these you know mostly consumer

3532
01:15:27,830 --> 01:15:27,840
from from these you know mostly consumer
 

3533
01:15:27,840 --> 01:15:31,990
from from these you know mostly consumer
electronics companies

3534
01:15:31,990 --> 01:15:32,000

 

3535
01:15:32,000 --> 01:15:36,830

and you know high on the list was

3536
01:15:36,830 --> 01:15:36,840
and you know high on the list was
 

3537
01:15:36,840 --> 01:15:40,870
and you know high on the list was
that they viewed their

3538
01:15:40,870 --> 01:15:40,880
that they viewed their
 

3539
01:15:40,880 --> 01:15:42,709
that they viewed their
like relationship with the customer as

3540
01:15:42,709 --> 01:15:42,719
like relationship with the customer as
 

3541
01:15:42,719 --> 01:15:44,550
like relationship with the customer as
sacred

3542
01:15:44,550 --> 01:15:44,560
sacred
 

3543
01:15:44,560 --> 01:15:47,910
sacred
um they they were never

3544
01:15:47,910 --> 01:15:47,920
um they they were never
 

3545
01:15:47,920 --> 01:15:50,950
um they they were never
ever willing to make

3546
01:15:50,950 --> 01:15:50,960
ever willing to make
 

3547
01:15:50,960 --> 01:15:54,390
ever willing to make
trade-offs between

3548
01:15:54,390 --> 01:15:54,400

 

3549
01:15:54,400 --> 01:15:58,310

for safety right so one of the things

3550
01:15:58,310 --> 01:15:58,320
for safety right so one of the things
 

3551
01:15:58,320 --> 01:15:59,669
for safety right so one of the things
that

3552
01:15:59,669 --> 01:15:59,679
that
 

3553
01:15:59,679 --> 01:16:02,310
that
had always made me nervous in the

3554
01:16:02,310 --> 01:16:02,320
had always made me nervous in the
 

3555
01:16:02,320 --> 01:16:04,950
had always made me nervous in the
computer industry

3556
01:16:04,950 --> 01:16:04,960
computer industry
 

3557
01:16:04,960 --> 01:16:07,990
computer industry
was that um

3558
01:16:07,990 --> 01:16:08,000
was that um
 

3559
01:16:08,000 --> 01:16:10,310
was that um
people were willing to make trade-offs

3560
01:16:10,310 --> 01:16:10,320
people were willing to make trade-offs
 

3561
01:16:10,320 --> 01:16:12,149
people were willing to make trade-offs
in reliability

3562
01:16:12,149 --> 01:16:12,159
in reliability
 

3563
01:16:12,159 --> 01:16:15,669
in reliability
to get performance um

3564
01:16:15,669 --> 01:16:15,679
to get performance um
 

3565
01:16:15,679 --> 01:16:17,830
to get performance um
you know the the you know they want

3566
01:16:17,830 --> 01:16:17,840
you know the the you know they want
 

3567
01:16:17,840 --> 01:16:19,590
you know the the you know they want
faster faster it breaks a little more

3568
01:16:19,590 --> 01:16:19,600
faster faster it breaks a little more
 

3569
01:16:19,600 --> 01:16:19,990
faster faster it breaks a little more
often

3570
01:16:19,990 --> 01:16:20,000
often
 

3571
01:16:20,000 --> 01:16:21,830
often
because it's fast you know you maybe you

3572
01:16:21,830 --> 01:16:21,840
because it's fast you know you maybe you
 

3573
01:16:21,840 --> 01:16:23,910
because it's fast you know you maybe you
run it a little hotter than you should

3574
01:16:23,910 --> 01:16:23,920
run it a little hotter than you should
 

3575
01:16:23,920 --> 01:16:27,189
run it a little hotter than you should
or like like the one that always blew my

3576
01:16:27,189 --> 01:16:27,199
or like like the one that always blew my
 

3577
01:16:27,199 --> 01:16:29,189
or like like the one that always blew my
mind was the way that

3578
01:16:29,189 --> 01:16:29,199
mind was the way that
 

3579
01:16:29,199 --> 01:16:34,149
mind was the way that
um the folks at at cray super computers

3580
01:16:34,149 --> 01:16:34,159
um the folks at at cray super computers
 

3581
01:16:34,159 --> 01:16:38,870
um the folks at at cray super computers
got their division to be really fast

3582
01:16:38,870 --> 01:16:38,880
got their division to be really fast
 

3583
01:16:38,880 --> 01:16:41,669
got their division to be really fast
was that they did newton-raphson

3584
01:16:41,669 --> 01:16:41,679
was that they did newton-raphson
 

3585
01:16:41,679 --> 01:16:44,229
was that they did newton-raphson
approximations

3586
01:16:44,229 --> 01:16:44,239
approximations
 

3587
01:16:44,239 --> 01:16:48,870
approximations
and so you know the bottom several bits

3588
01:16:48,870 --> 01:16:48,880
and so you know the bottom several bits
 

3589
01:16:48,880 --> 01:16:52,390
and so you know the bottom several bits
of you know a over b we're essentially

3590
01:16:52,390 --> 01:16:52,400
of you know a over b we're essentially
 

3591
01:16:52,400 --> 01:16:54,870
of you know a over b we're essentially
random numbers

3592
01:16:54,870 --> 01:16:54,880
random numbers
 

3593
01:16:54,880 --> 01:16:57,110
random numbers
um what could possibly go wrong what

3594
01:16:57,110 --> 01:16:57,120
um what could possibly go wrong what
 

3595
01:16:57,120 --> 01:16:58,630
um what could possibly go wrong what
could go wrong

3596
01:16:58,630 --> 01:16:58,640
could go wrong
 

3597
01:16:58,640 --> 01:17:03,510
could go wrong
right and you know

3598
01:17:03,510 --> 01:17:03,520
right and you know
 

3599
01:17:03,520 --> 01:17:06,950
right and you know
just figuring out how to nail the bottom

3600
01:17:06,950 --> 01:17:06,960
just figuring out how to nail the bottom
 

3601
01:17:06,960 --> 01:17:08,149
just figuring out how to nail the bottom
bit

3602
01:17:08,149 --> 01:17:08,159
bit
 

3603
01:17:08,159 --> 01:17:11,350
bit
um how to make sure that you know

3604
01:17:11,350 --> 01:17:11,360
um how to make sure that you know
 

3605
01:17:11,360 --> 01:17:14,630
um how to make sure that you know
if you put a piece of toast in a toaster

3606
01:17:14,630 --> 01:17:14,640
if you put a piece of toast in a toaster
 

3607
01:17:14,640 --> 01:17:18,229
if you put a piece of toast in a toaster
it's not going to kill the customer

3608
01:17:18,229 --> 01:17:18,239
it's not going to kill the customer
 

3609
01:17:18,239 --> 01:17:20,390
it's not going to kill the customer
it's not going to burst into flames and

3610
01:17:20,390 --> 01:17:20,400
it's not going to burst into flames and
 

3611
01:17:20,400 --> 01:17:22,470
it's not going to burst into flames and
burn the house down

3612
01:17:22,470 --> 01:17:22,480
burn the house down
 

3613
01:17:22,480 --> 01:17:24,550
burn the house down
so those are i guess those are the the

3614
01:17:24,550 --> 01:17:24,560
so those are i guess those are the the
 

3615
01:17:24,560 --> 01:17:26,790
so those are i guess those are the the
principles that were inspiring

3616
01:17:26,790 --> 01:17:26,800
principles that were inspiring
 

3617
01:17:26,800 --> 01:17:30,550
principles that were inspiring
but how did from the days of

3618
01:17:30,550 --> 01:17:30,560
but how did from the days of
 

3619
01:17:30,560 --> 01:17:33,750
but how did from the days of
uh java is called oak because of a tree

3620
01:17:33,750 --> 01:17:33,760
uh java is called oak because of a tree
 

3621
01:17:33,760 --> 01:17:35,510
uh java is called oak because of a tree
outside the window story that

3622
01:17:35,510 --> 01:17:35,520
outside the window story that
 

3623
01:17:35,520 --> 01:17:38,310
outside the window story that
people know how did it become this

3624
01:17:38,310 --> 01:17:38,320
people know how did it become this
 

3625
01:17:38,320 --> 01:17:39,910
people know how did it become this
incredible

3626
01:17:39,910 --> 01:17:39,920
incredible
 

3627
01:17:39,920 --> 01:17:44,470
incredible
like powerful language well

3628
01:17:44,470 --> 01:17:44,480
like powerful language well
 

3629
01:17:44,480 --> 01:17:47,510
like powerful language well
so it was a bunch of things so we you

3630
01:17:47,510 --> 01:17:47,520
so it was a bunch of things so we you
 

3631
01:17:47,520 --> 01:17:47,990
so it was a bunch of things so we you
know

3632
01:17:47,990 --> 01:17:48,000
know
 

3633
01:17:48,000 --> 01:17:50,149
know
after all that we started you know the

3634
01:17:50,149 --> 01:17:50,159
after all that we started you know the
 

3635
01:17:50,159 --> 01:17:52,229
after all that we started you know the
way that we decided that we could

3636
01:17:52,229 --> 01:17:52,239
way that we decided that we could
 

3637
01:17:52,239 --> 01:17:55,350
way that we decided that we could
understand things better was by

3638
01:17:55,350 --> 01:17:55,360
understand things better was by
 

3639
01:17:55,360 --> 01:17:58,149
understand things better was by
building a demo building a prototype of

3640
01:17:58,149 --> 01:17:58,159
building a demo building a prototype of
 

3641
01:17:58,159 --> 01:17:58,870
building a demo building a prototype of
something

3642
01:17:58,870 --> 01:17:58,880
something
 

3643
01:17:58,880 --> 01:18:02,070
something
okay so um kind of because it was easy

3644
01:18:02,070 --> 01:18:02,080
okay so um kind of because it was easy
 

3645
01:18:02,080 --> 01:18:04,310
okay so um kind of because it was easy
and fun we decided to build

3646
01:18:04,310 --> 01:18:04,320
and fun we decided to build
 

3647
01:18:04,320 --> 01:18:07,189
and fun we decided to build
a control system for some home

3648
01:18:07,189 --> 01:18:07,199
a control system for some home
 

3649
01:18:07,199 --> 01:18:08,630
a control system for some home
electronics you know tv

3650
01:18:08,630 --> 01:18:08,640
electronics you know tv
 

3651
01:18:08,640 --> 01:18:12,390
electronics you know tv
vcr that kind of stuff and

3652
01:18:12,390 --> 01:18:12,400
vcr that kind of stuff and
 

3653
01:18:12,400 --> 01:18:15,110
vcr that kind of stuff and
as we were building it we you know we we

3654
01:18:15,110 --> 01:18:15,120
as we were building it we you know we we
 

3655
01:18:15,120 --> 01:18:15,830
as we were building it we you know we we
sort of

3656
01:18:15,830 --> 01:18:15,840
sort of
 

3657
01:18:15,840 --> 01:18:18,070
sort of
discovered that there were some things

3658
01:18:18,070 --> 01:18:18,080
discovered that there were some things
 

3659
01:18:18,080 --> 01:18:19,990
discovered that there were some things
about standard practice in c

3660
01:18:19,990 --> 01:18:20,000
about standard practice in c
 

3661
01:18:20,000 --> 01:18:24,390
about standard practice in c
programming that um

3662
01:18:24,390 --> 01:18:24,400
programming that um
 

3663
01:18:24,400 --> 01:18:27,350
programming that um
were really getting in the way and it

3664
01:18:27,350 --> 01:18:27,360
were really getting in the way and it
 

3665
01:18:27,360 --> 01:18:28,070
were really getting in the way and it
wasn't

3666
01:18:28,070 --> 01:18:28,080
wasn't
 

3667
01:18:28,080 --> 01:18:30,229
wasn't
it wasn't exactly you know because we

3668
01:18:30,229 --> 01:18:30,239
it wasn't exactly you know because we
 

3669
01:18:30,239 --> 01:18:31,350
it wasn't exactly you know because we
were writing this

3670
01:18:31,350 --> 01:18:31,360
were writing this
 

3671
01:18:31,360 --> 01:18:35,750
were writing this
all the c code and c plus plus code that

3672
01:18:35,750 --> 01:18:35,760
all the c code and c plus plus code that
 

3673
01:18:35,760 --> 01:18:37,189
all the c code and c plus plus code that
that we couldn't write it to do the

3674
01:18:37,189 --> 01:18:37,199
that we couldn't write it to do the
 

3675
01:18:37,199 --> 01:18:39,110
that we couldn't write it to do the
right thing but that

3676
01:18:39,110 --> 01:18:39,120
right thing but that
 

3677
01:18:39,120 --> 01:18:41,750
right thing but that
um one of the things that was weird in

3678
01:18:41,750 --> 01:18:41,760
um one of the things that was weird in
 

3679
01:18:41,760 --> 01:18:44,149
um one of the things that was weird in
the group was that we had

3680
01:18:44,149 --> 01:18:44,159
the group was that we had
 

3681
01:18:44,159 --> 01:18:47,430
the group was that we had
um a guy who's who's

3682
01:18:47,430 --> 01:18:47,440
um a guy who's who's
 

3683
01:18:47,440 --> 01:18:50,550
um a guy who's who's
who's you know his sort of top level job

3684
01:18:50,550 --> 01:18:50,560
who's you know his sort of top level job
 

3685
01:18:50,560 --> 01:18:52,550
who's you know his sort of top level job
was he was a business guy

3686
01:18:52,550 --> 01:18:52,560
was he was a business guy
 

3687
01:18:52,560 --> 01:18:55,590
was he was a business guy
you know he was sort of an mba kind of

3688
01:18:55,590 --> 01:18:55,600
you know he was sort of an mba kind of
 

3689
01:18:55,600 --> 01:18:57,350
you know he was sort of an mba kind of
person you know think about business

plans and all of that
and

3694
01:19:01,750 --> 01:19:01,760

 

3695
01:19:01,760 --> 01:19:03,110

you know there were a bunch of things

3696
01:19:03,110 --> 01:19:03,120
you know there were a bunch of things
 

3697
01:19:03,120 --> 01:19:04,870
you know there were a bunch of things
that were kind of

3698
01:19:04,870 --> 01:19:04,880
that were kind of
 

3699
01:19:04,880 --> 01:19:06,470
that were kind of
you know and we would talk about things

3700
01:19:06,470 --> 01:19:06,480
you know and we would talk about things
 

3701
01:19:06,480 --> 01:19:08,310
you know and we would talk about things
that were going wrong and

3702
01:19:08,310 --> 01:19:08,320
that were going wrong and
 

3703
01:19:08,320 --> 01:19:10,310
that were going wrong and
um or things were going wrong things

3704
01:19:10,310 --> 01:19:10,320
um or things were going wrong things
 

3705
01:19:10,320 --> 01:19:12,470
um or things were going wrong things
were going right and

3706
01:19:12,470 --> 01:19:12,480
were going right and
 

3707
01:19:12,480 --> 01:19:14,229
were going right and
you know as we thought about you know

3708
01:19:14,229 --> 01:19:14,239
you know as we thought about you know
 

3709
01:19:14,239 --> 01:19:16,470
you know as we thought about you know
things like like the requirements for

3710
01:19:16,470 --> 01:19:16,480
things like like the requirements for
 

3711
01:19:16,480 --> 01:19:20,149
things like like the requirements for
security and safety um

3712
01:19:20,149 --> 01:19:20,159
security and safety um
 

3713
01:19:20,159 --> 01:19:22,709
security and safety um
some low-level details and see like

3714
01:19:22,709 --> 01:19:22,719
some low-level details and see like
 

3715
01:19:22,719 --> 01:19:24,149
some low-level details and see like
naked pointers

3716
01:19:24,149 --> 01:19:24,159
naked pointers
 

3717
01:19:24,159 --> 01:19:27,430
naked pointers
yeah and you know

3718
01:19:27,430 --> 01:19:27,440
yeah and you know
 

3719
01:19:27,440 --> 01:19:30,709
yeah and you know
so so back in the early 90s

3720
01:19:30,709 --> 01:19:30,719
so so back in the early 90s
 

3721
01:19:30,719 --> 01:19:35,350
so so back in the early 90s
um it was well understood

3722
01:19:35,350 --> 01:19:35,360
um it was well understood
 

3723
01:19:35,360 --> 01:19:39,350
um it was well understood
that you know the number one source of

3724
01:19:39,350 --> 01:19:39,360
that you know the number one source of
 

3725
01:19:39,360 --> 01:19:41,750
that you know the number one source of
like security vulnerabilities is

3726
01:19:41,750 --> 01:19:41,760
like security vulnerabilities is
 

3727
01:19:41,760 --> 01:19:44,790
like security vulnerabilities is
pointers was just pointers was just bugs

3728
01:19:44,790 --> 01:19:44,800
pointers was just pointers was just bugs
 

3729
01:19:44,800 --> 01:19:47,990
pointers was just pointers was just bugs
yeah right and it was like you know

3730
01:19:47,990 --> 01:19:48,000
yeah right and it was like you know
 

3731
01:19:48,000 --> 01:19:51,430
yeah right and it was like you know
50 60 70 of all security

3732
01:19:51,430 --> 01:19:51,440
50 60 70 of all security
 

3733
01:19:51,440 --> 01:19:53,910
50 60 70 of all security
vulnerabilities were bugs and the vast

3734
01:19:53,910 --> 01:19:53,920
vulnerabilities were bugs and the vast
 

3735
01:19:53,920 --> 01:19:55,669
vulnerabilities were bugs and the vast
majority of them were like

3736
01:19:55,669 --> 01:19:55,679
majority of them were like
 

3737
01:19:55,679 --> 01:19:58,790
majority of them were like
buffer overflows yeah so you're like

3738
01:19:58,790 --> 01:19:58,800
buffer overflows yeah so you're like
 

3739
01:19:58,800 --> 01:20:00,870
buffer overflows yeah so you're like
we have to fix this we we have to make

3740
01:20:00,870 --> 01:20:00,880
we have to fix this we we have to make
 

3741
01:20:00,880 --> 01:20:01,990
we have to fix this we we have to make
sure that this

3742
01:20:01,990 --> 01:20:02,000
sure that this
 

3743
01:20:02,000 --> 01:20:05,270
sure that this
cannot happen and that was kind of the

3744
01:20:05,270 --> 01:20:05,280
cannot happen and that was kind of the
 

3745
01:20:05,280 --> 01:20:06,550
cannot happen and that was kind of the
original

3746
01:20:06,550 --> 01:20:06,560
original
 

3747
01:20:06,560 --> 01:20:09,910
original
thing for me was this cannot this cannot

3748
01:20:09,910 --> 01:20:09,920
thing for me was this cannot this cannot
 

3749
01:20:09,920 --> 01:20:11,510
thing for me was this cannot this cannot

01:20:24,790 --> 01:20:24,800
there was this article that came out
 

3759
01:20:24,800 --> 01:20:28,070
there was this article that came out
that was um an examination

3760

it was sort of the result of of an
 

3763
01:20:30,480 --> 01:20:32,350
it was sort of the result of of an
examination of all the security

3764
01:20:32,350 --> 01:20:32,360
examination of all the security
 

3765
01:20:32,360 --> 01:20:35,910
examination of all the security
vulnerabilities in chrome and chrome is

3766
01:20:35,910 --> 01:20:35,920
vulnerabilities in chrome and chrome is
 

3767
01:20:35,920 --> 01:20:39,110
vulnerabilities in chrome and chrome is
like a giant piece of c-plus plus code

3768
01:20:39,110 --> 01:20:39,120
like a giant piece of c-plus plus code
 

3769
01:20:39,120 --> 01:20:42,470
like a giant piece of c-plus plus code
and 60 or 70 percent of all the security

3770
01:20:42,470 --> 01:20:42,480
and 60 or 70 percent of all the security
 

3771
01:20:42,480 --> 01:20:46,070
and 60 or 70 percent of all the security
vulnerabilities were stupid pointer

3772
01:20:46,070 --> 01:20:46,080

tricks

3774
01:20:48,070 --> 01:20:48,080
tricks
 

3775
01:20:48,080 --> 01:20:52,790
tricks
and i thought it's 30 years later

3776

we're still there
 

3781
01:20:56,320 --> 01:20:58,470
we're still there
and you know i you know that's one of

3782
01:20:58,470 --> 01:20:58,480
and you know i you know that's one of
 

3783
01:20:58,480 --> 01:21:02,229
and you know i you know that's one of
those you know slap your forehead and

01:21:02,229 --> 01:21:02,239
those you know slap your forehead and
 

3785
01:21:02,239 --> 01:21:05,350
those you know slap your forehead and
and and just just just want to cry would

3786

and and just just just want to cry would
 

3787
01:21:05,360 --> 01:21:06,870
and and just just just want to cry would
you attribute

3788
01:21:06,870 --> 01:21:06,880
you attribute
 

3789
01:21:06,880 --> 01:21:08,149
you attribute
uh or is that too much of a

3790
01:21:08,149 --> 01:21:08,159
uh or is that too much of a
 

3791
01:21:08,159 --> 01:21:10,070
uh or is that too much of a
simplification but would you attribute

3792
01:21:10,070 --> 01:21:10,080
simplification but would you attribute
 

3793
01:21:10,080 --> 01:21:11,850
simplification but would you attribute
the creation of java to uh

3794
01:21:11,850 --> 01:21:11,860
the creation of java to uh
 

3795
01:21:11,860 --> 01:21:13,030
the creation of java to uh

that i mean that was

3800
01:21:17,750 --> 01:21:17,760
that i mean that was
 

3801
01:21:17,760 --> 01:21:21,750
that i mean that was
that was one of the the trigger points

3802
01:21:21,750 --> 01:21:21,760
that was one of the the trigger points
 

3803
01:21:21,760 --> 01:21:23,350
that was one of the the trigger points
and currency you've mentioned

3804
01:21:23,350 --> 01:21:23,360
and currency you've mentioned
 

3805
01:21:23,360 --> 01:21:25,750
and currency you've mentioned
concurrency was a big deal

3806
01:21:25,750 --> 01:21:25,760
concurrency was a big deal
 

3807
01:21:25,760 --> 01:21:28,790
concurrency was a big deal
um and you know because when you're

3808
01:21:28,790 --> 01:21:28,800
um and you know because when you're
 

3809
01:21:28,800 --> 01:21:31,110
um and you know because when you're
interacting with people you know the

3810
01:21:31,110 --> 01:21:31,120
interacting with people you know the
 

3811
01:21:31,120 --> 01:21:32,950
interacting with people you know the
last thing you ever want to see is

3812
01:21:32,950 --> 01:21:32,960
last thing you ever want to see is
 

3813
01:21:32,960 --> 01:21:36,950
last thing you ever want to see is
is the thing like waiting and

3814
01:21:36,950 --> 01:21:36,960
is the thing like waiting and
 

3815
01:21:36,960 --> 01:21:39,510
is the thing like waiting and
you know issues about the software

3816
01:21:39,510 --> 01:21:39,520
you know issues about the software
 

3817
01:21:39,520 --> 01:21:41,669
you know issues about the software
development process

3818
01:21:41,669 --> 01:21:41,679
development process
 

3819
01:21:41,679 --> 01:21:43,590
development process
you know when faults happen can you

3820
01:21:43,590 --> 01:21:43,600
you know when faults happen can you
 

3821
01:21:43,600 --> 01:21:45,830
you know when faults happen can you
recover from them

3822
01:21:45,830 --> 01:21:45,840
recover from them
 

3823
01:21:45,840 --> 01:21:49,510
recover from them
what can you do to make it easier to

3824
01:21:49,510 --> 01:21:49,520
what can you do to make it easier to
 

3825
01:21:49,520 --> 01:21:50,709
what can you do to make it easier to
create and

3826
01:21:50,709 --> 01:21:50,719
create and
 

3827
01:21:50,719 --> 01:21:54,629
create and
eliminate complex data structures

3828
01:21:54,629 --> 01:21:54,639
eliminate complex data structures
 

3829
01:21:54,639 --> 01:21:57,270
eliminate complex data structures
what can you do to fix you know the one

3830
01:21:57,270 --> 01:21:57,280
what can you do to fix you know the one
 

3831
01:21:57,280 --> 01:21:58,950
what can you do to fix you know the one
of the most common

3832
01:21:58,950 --> 01:21:58,960
of the most common
 

3833
01:21:58,960 --> 01:22:02,470
of the most common
sea problems which is storage leaks

3834
01:22:02,470 --> 01:22:02,480
sea problems which is storage leaks
 

3835
01:22:02,480 --> 01:22:06,950
sea problems which is storage leaks
um and it's it's evil twin the

3836
01:22:06,950 --> 01:22:06,960
um and it's it's evil twin the
 

3837
01:22:06,960 --> 01:22:09,990
um and it's it's evil twin the
um the the freed

3838
01:22:09,990 --> 01:22:10,000
um the the freed
 

3839
01:22:10,000 --> 01:22:13,110
um the the freed
but still being used piece of

3840
01:22:13,110 --> 01:22:13,120
but still being used piece of
 

3841
01:22:13,120 --> 01:22:15,030
but still being used piece of
piece of memory you know you you free

3842
01:22:15,030 --> 01:22:15,040
piece of memory you know you you free
 

3843
01:22:15,040 --> 01:22:17,750
piece of memory you know you you free
something and then you keep using it

3844
01:22:17,750 --> 01:22:17,760
something and then you keep using it
 

3845
01:22:17,760 --> 01:22:20,390
something and then you keep using it
oh yeah you know so so when i was

3846
01:22:20,390 --> 01:22:20,400
oh yeah you know so so when i was
 

3847
01:22:20,400 --> 01:22:21,750
oh yeah you know so so when i was
originally thinking about that i was

3848
01:22:21,750 --> 01:22:21,760
originally thinking about that i was
 

3849
01:22:21,760 --> 01:22:24,470
originally thinking about that i was
thinking about it in terms of

3850
01:22:24,470 --> 01:22:24,480
thinking about it in terms of
 

3851
01:22:24,480 --> 01:22:26,629
thinking about it in terms of
of sort of safety and security issues

3852
01:22:26,629 --> 01:22:26,639
of sort of safety and security issues
 

3853
01:22:26,639 --> 01:22:27,990
of sort of safety and security issues
and one of the things i sort of came to

3854
01:22:27,990 --> 01:22:28,000
and one of the things i sort of came to
 

3855
01:22:28,000 --> 01:22:28,790
and one of the things i sort of came to
believe

3856
01:22:28,790 --> 01:22:28,800
believe
 

3857
01:22:28,800 --> 01:22:31,750
believe
came to understand was that it wasn't

3858
01:22:31,750 --> 01:22:31,760
came to understand was that it wasn't
 

3859
01:22:31,760 --> 01:22:33,510
came to understand was that it wasn't
just about safety and security but it

3860
01:22:33,510 --> 01:22:33,520
just about safety and security but it
 

3861
01:22:33,520 --> 01:22:36,229
just about safety and security but it
was about

3862
01:22:36,229 --> 01:22:36,239

 

3863
01:22:36,239 --> 01:22:40,950

developer velocity right so

3864
01:22:40,950 --> 01:22:40,960
developer velocity right so
 

3865
01:22:40,960 --> 01:22:43,350
developer velocity right so
and i got really religious about this

3866
01:22:43,350 --> 01:22:43,360
and i got really religious about this
 

3867
01:22:43,360 --> 01:22:45,510
and i got really religious about this
because at that point i had spent

3868
01:22:45,510 --> 01:22:45,520
because at that point i had spent
 

3869
01:22:45,520 --> 01:22:49,590
because at that point i had spent
an ungodly amount of my life

3870
01:22:49,590 --> 01:22:49,600

 

3871
01:22:49,600 --> 01:22:54,950

hunting down mystery pointer bugs

3872
01:22:54,950 --> 01:22:54,960
hunting down mystery pointer bugs
 

3873
01:22:54,960 --> 01:22:58,790
hunting down mystery pointer bugs
and you know like like two-thirds of my

3874
01:22:58,790 --> 01:22:58,800
and you know like like two-thirds of my
 

3875
01:22:58,800 --> 01:22:59,350
and you know like like two-thirds of my
time

3876
01:22:59,350 --> 01:22:59,360
time
 

3877
01:22:59,360 --> 01:23:01,910
time
as a software developer was you know

3878
01:23:01,910 --> 01:23:01,920
as a software developer was you know
 

3879
01:23:01,920 --> 01:23:03,990
as a software developer was you know
because the mystery pointer bugs tend to

3880
01:23:03,990 --> 01:23:04,000
because the mystery pointer bugs tend to
 

3881
01:23:04,000 --> 01:23:04,310
because the mystery pointer bugs tend to
be

3882
01:23:04,310 --> 01:23:04,320
be
 

3883
01:23:04,320 --> 01:23:07,990
be
the hardest to find because they tend to

3884
01:23:07,990 --> 01:23:08,000
the hardest to find because they tend to
 

3885
01:23:08,000 --> 01:23:09,110
the hardest to find because they tend to
be

3886
01:23:09,110 --> 01:23:09,120
be
 

3887
01:23:09,120 --> 01:23:12,870
be
very very statistical the ones that hurt

3888
01:23:12,870 --> 01:23:12,880
very very statistical the ones that hurt
 

3889
01:23:12,880 --> 01:23:14,550
very very statistical the ones that hurt
you know they're you know they're like a

3890
01:23:14,550 --> 01:23:14,560
you know they're you know they're like a
 

3891
01:23:14,560 --> 01:23:17,350
you know they're you know they're like a
one in a million chance

3892
01:23:17,350 --> 01:23:17,360
one in a million chance
 

3893
01:23:17,360 --> 01:23:20,709
one in a million chance
um and

3894
01:23:20,709 --> 01:23:20,719
um and
 

3895
01:23:20,719 --> 01:23:22,310
um and
but nevertheless create an infinite

3896
01:23:22,310 --> 01:23:22,320
but nevertheless create an infinite
 

3897
01:23:22,320 --> 01:23:24,390
but nevertheless create an infinite
amount of suffering right

3898
01:23:24,390 --> 01:23:24,400
amount of suffering right
 

3899
01:23:24,400 --> 01:23:26,070
amount of suffering right
because when you're doing a billion

3900
01:23:26,070 --> 01:23:26,080
because when you're doing a billion
 

3901
01:23:26,080 --> 01:23:27,590
because when you're doing a billion
operations a second

3902
01:23:27,590 --> 01:23:27,600
operations a second
 

3903
01:23:27,600 --> 01:23:30,070
operations a second
yeah you know one in a million chance

3904
01:23:30,070 --> 01:23:30,080
yeah you know one in a million chance
 

3905
01:23:30,080 --> 01:23:31,590
yeah you know one in a million chance
means

3906
01:23:31,590 --> 01:23:31,600
means
 

3907
01:23:31,600 --> 01:23:35,270
means
it's going to happen um

3908
01:23:35,270 --> 01:23:35,280
it's going to happen um
 

3909
01:23:35,280 --> 01:23:37,750
it's going to happen um
and and so i got really religious about

3910
01:23:37,750 --> 01:23:37,760
and and so i got really religious about
 

3911
01:23:37,760 --> 01:23:38,790
and and so i got really religious about
this thing about

3912
01:23:38,790 --> 01:23:38,800
this thing about
 

3913
01:23:38,800 --> 01:23:40,550
this thing about
you know making it so that if something

3914
01:23:40,550 --> 01:23:40,560
you know making it so that if something
 

3915
01:23:40,560 --> 01:23:43,110
you know making it so that if something
fails it fails immediately and

3916
01:23:43,110 --> 01:23:43,120
fails it fails immediately and
 

3917
01:23:43,120 --> 01:23:46,390
fails it fails immediately and
visibly and

3918
01:23:46,390 --> 01:23:46,400
visibly and
 

3919
01:23:46,400 --> 01:23:49,189
visibly and
you know one of the the the things that

3920
01:23:49,189 --> 01:23:49,199
you know one of the the the things that
 

3921
01:23:49,199 --> 01:23:50,070
you know one of the the the things that
was a

3922
01:23:50,070 --> 01:23:50,080
was a
 

3923
01:23:50,080 --> 01:23:53,110
was a
a real attraction of java to

3924
01:23:53,110 --> 01:23:53,120
a real attraction of java to
 

3925
01:23:53,120 --> 01:23:55,510
a real attraction of java to
lots of development shops was that you

3926
01:23:55,510 --> 01:23:55,520
lots of development shops was that you
 

3927
01:23:55,520 --> 01:23:56,950
lots of development shops was that you
know we get our code

3928
01:23:56,950 --> 01:23:56,960
know we get our code
 

3929
01:23:56,960 --> 01:24:00,870
know we get our code
up and running twice as fast

3930
01:24:00,870 --> 01:24:00,880
up and running twice as fast
 

3931
01:24:00,880 --> 01:24:02,310
up and running twice as fast
you mean like the entirety of the

3932
01:24:02,310 --> 01:24:02,320
you mean like the entirety of the
 

3933
01:24:02,320 --> 01:24:04,229
you mean like the entirety of the
development process the blocking all

3934
01:24:04,229 --> 01:24:04,239
development process the blocking all
 

3935
01:24:04,239 --> 01:24:05,110
development process the blocking all
that kind of stuff yeah

3936
01:24:05,110 --> 01:24:05,120
that kind of stuff yeah
 

3937
01:24:05,120 --> 01:24:07,669
that kind of stuff yeah
if you you know so so if you measure

3938
01:24:07,669 --> 01:24:07,679
if you you know so so if you measure
 

3939
01:24:07,679 --> 01:24:08,229
if you you know so so if you measure
time

3940
01:24:08,229 --> 01:24:08,239
time
 

3941
01:24:08,239 --> 01:24:11,669
time
from you know you you first

3942
01:24:11,669 --> 01:24:11,679
from you know you you first
 

3943
01:24:11,679 --> 01:24:14,229
from you know you you first
touch fingers to keyboard until you get

3944
01:24:14,229 --> 01:24:14,239
touch fingers to keyboard until you get
 

3945
01:24:14,239 --> 01:24:15,189
touch fingers to keyboard until you get
your first demo

3946
01:24:15,189 --> 01:24:15,199
your first demo
 

3947
01:24:15,199 --> 01:24:19,510
your first demo
out uh

3948
01:24:19,510 --> 01:24:19,520

 

3949
01:24:19,520 --> 01:24:22,070

not much different but if you look from

3950
01:24:22,070 --> 01:24:22,080
not much different but if you look from
 

3951
01:24:22,080 --> 01:24:24,629
not much different but if you look from
fingers touching keyboard to

3952
01:24:24,629 --> 01:24:24,639
fingers touching keyboard to
 

3953
01:24:24,639 --> 01:24:27,270
fingers touching keyboard to
solid piece of software that you could

3954
01:24:27,270 --> 01:24:27,280
solid piece of software that you could
 

3955
01:24:27,280 --> 01:24:29,590
solid piece of software that you could
release in production

3956
01:24:29,590 --> 01:24:29,600
release in production
 

3957
01:24:29,600 --> 01:24:32,629
release in production
it would be way faster and i think what

3958
01:24:32,629 --> 01:24:32,639
it would be way faster and i think what
 

3959
01:24:32,639 --> 01:24:34,470
it would be way faster and i think what
people don't often realize there's

3960
01:24:34,470 --> 01:24:34,480
people don't often realize there's
 

3961
01:24:34,480 --> 01:24:36,390
people don't often realize there's
yeah there's things that really slow you

3962
01:24:36,390 --> 01:24:36,400
yeah there's things that really slow you
 

3963
01:24:36,400 --> 01:24:37,590
yeah there's things that really slow you
down like

3964
01:24:37,590 --> 01:24:37,600
down like
 

3965
01:24:37,600 --> 01:24:41,110
down like
hard to catch bugs probably is

3966
01:24:41,110 --> 01:24:41,120
hard to catch bugs probably is
 

3967
01:24:41,120 --> 01:24:43,110
hard to catch bugs probably is
is the thing that really slows down that

3968
01:24:43,110 --> 01:24:43,120
is the thing that really slows down that
 

3969
01:24:43,120 --> 01:24:45,669
is the thing that really slows down that
is it really slows things down but

3970
01:24:45,669 --> 01:24:45,679
is it really slows things down but
 

3971
01:24:45,679 --> 01:24:47,350
is it really slows things down but
but also there were you know one of the

3972
01:24:47,350 --> 01:24:47,360
but also there were you know one of the
 

3973
01:24:47,360 --> 01:24:49,750
but also there were you know one of the
things that you get out of

3974
01:24:49,750 --> 01:24:49,760
things that you get out of
 

3975
01:24:49,760 --> 01:24:52,149
things that you get out of
object-oriented programming is a strict

3976
01:24:52,149 --> 01:24:52,159
object-oriented programming is a strict
 

3977
01:24:52,159 --> 01:24:53,750
object-oriented programming is a strict
methodology about you know what are the

3978
01:24:53,750 --> 01:24:53,760
methodology about you know what are the
 

3979
01:24:53,760 --> 01:24:55,910
methodology about you know what are the
interfaces between things

3980
01:24:55,910 --> 01:24:55,920
interfaces between things
 

3981
01:24:55,920 --> 01:24:59,350
interfaces between things
and being really clear about how parts

3982
01:24:59,350 --> 01:24:59,360
and being really clear about how parts
 

3983
01:24:59,360 --> 01:25:01,350
and being really clear about how parts
relate to each other

3984
01:25:01,350 --> 01:25:01,360
relate to each other
 

3985
01:25:01,360 --> 01:25:04,629
relate to each other
um and what that helps with

3986
01:25:04,629 --> 01:25:04,639
um and what that helps with
 

3987
01:25:04,639 --> 01:25:08,950
um and what that helps with
is so many times what people do

3988
01:25:08,950 --> 01:25:08,960
is so many times what people do
 

3989
01:25:08,960 --> 01:25:11,110
is so many times what people do
um is they kind of like sneak around the

3990
01:25:11,110 --> 01:25:11,120
um is they kind of like sneak around the
 

3991
01:25:11,120 --> 01:25:12,310
um is they kind of like sneak around the
side

3992
01:25:12,310 --> 01:25:12,320
side
 

3993
01:25:12,320 --> 01:25:14,709
side
so if you've built something and people

3994
01:25:14,709 --> 01:25:14,719
so if you've built something and people
 

3995
01:25:14,719 --> 01:25:16,870
so if you've built something and people
are using it

3996
01:25:16,870 --> 01:25:16,880
are using it
 

3997
01:25:16,880 --> 01:25:19,030
are using it
and then and you say and you say well

3998
01:25:19,030 --> 01:25:19,040
and then and you say and you say well
 

3999
01:25:19,040 --> 01:25:21,350
and then and you say and you say well
okay you know i built this thing

4000
01:25:21,350 --> 01:25:21,360
okay you know i built this thing
 

4001
01:25:21,360 --> 01:25:24,790
okay you know i built this thing
you use it this way and then you change

4002
01:25:24,790 --> 01:25:24,800
you use it this way and then you change
 

4003
01:25:24,800 --> 01:25:25,430
you use it this way and then you change
it

4004
01:25:25,430 --> 01:25:25,440
it
 

4005
01:25:25,440 --> 01:25:27,590
it
in such a way that that it still does

4006
01:25:27,590 --> 01:25:27,600
in such a way that that it still does
 

4007
01:25:27,600 --> 01:25:29,030
in such a way that that it still does
what you said it does it just does it a

4008
01:25:29,030 --> 01:25:29,040
what you said it does it just does it a
 

4009
01:25:29,040 --> 01:25:30,070
what you said it does it just does it a
little bit different

4010
01:25:30,070 --> 01:25:30,080
little bit different
 

4011
01:25:30,080 --> 01:25:32,390
little bit different
but then you find out that somebody out

4012
01:25:32,390 --> 01:25:32,400
but then you find out that somebody out
 

4013
01:25:32,400 --> 01:25:33,189
but then you find out that somebody out
there

4014
01:25:33,189 --> 01:25:33,199
there
 

4015
01:25:33,199 --> 01:25:35,990
there
was sneaking around the side they sort

4016
01:25:35,990 --> 01:25:36,000
was sneaking around the side they sort
 

4017
01:25:36,000 --> 01:25:38,149
was sneaking around the side they sort
of tunneled in a back door

4018
01:25:38,149 --> 01:25:38,159
of tunneled in a back door
 

4019
01:25:38,159 --> 01:25:41,910
of tunneled in a back door
and this person their code broke

4020
01:25:41,910 --> 01:25:41,920
and this person their code broke
 

4021
01:25:41,920 --> 01:25:45,590
and this person their code broke
and because they were sneaking through a

4022
01:25:45,590 --> 01:25:45,600
and because they were sneaking through a
 

4023
01:25:45,600 --> 01:25:47,030
and because they were sneaking through a
side door

4024
01:25:47,030 --> 01:25:47,040
side door
 

4025
01:25:47,040 --> 01:25:50,310
side door
and and

4026
01:25:50,310 --> 01:25:50,320
and and
 

4027
01:25:50,320 --> 01:25:54,070
and and
normally the attitude is

4028
01:25:54,070 --> 01:25:54,080
normally the attitude is
 

4029
01:25:54,080 --> 01:25:58,229
normally the attitude is
dummy um but a lot of times

4030
01:25:58,229 --> 01:25:58,239
dummy um but a lot of times
 

4031
01:25:58,239 --> 01:26:02,470
dummy um but a lot of times
um you know you can't get away you can't

4032
01:26:02,470 --> 01:26:02,480
um you know you can't get away you can't
 

4033
01:26:02,480 --> 01:26:04,870
um you know you can't get away you can't
you can't just slap their hand and tell

4034
01:26:04,870 --> 01:26:04,880
you can't just slap their hand and tell
 

4035
01:26:04,880 --> 01:26:06,229
you can't just slap their hand and tell
them to not do that

4036
01:26:06,229 --> 01:26:06,239
them to not do that
 

4037
01:26:06,239 --> 01:26:09,350
them to not do that
right because you know it's

4038
01:26:09,350 --> 01:26:09,360
right because you know it's
 

4039
01:26:09,360 --> 01:26:12,629
right because you know it's
you know somebody's

4040
01:26:12,629 --> 01:26:12,639

 

4041
01:26:12,639 --> 01:26:15,510

you know some banks you know account

4042
01:26:15,510 --> 01:26:15,520
you know some banks you know account
 

4043
01:26:15,520 --> 01:26:17,910
you know some banks you know account
reconciliation system

4044
01:26:17,910 --> 01:26:17,920
reconciliation system
 

4045
01:26:17,920 --> 01:26:20,149
reconciliation system
that that you know some developer

4046
01:26:20,149 --> 01:26:20,159
that that you know some developer
 

4047
01:26:20,159 --> 01:26:22,390
that that you know some developer
decided oh i'm lazy

4048
01:26:22,390 --> 01:26:22,400
decided oh i'm lazy
 

4049
01:26:22,400 --> 01:26:24,070
decided oh i'm lazy
you know i'll just sneak through the

4050
01:26:24,070 --> 01:26:24,080
you know i'll just sneak through the
 

4051
01:26:24,080 --> 01:26:26,229
you know i'll just sneak through the
back door because the language allows it

4052
01:26:26,229 --> 01:26:26,239
back door because the language allows it
 

4053
01:26:26,239 --> 01:26:28,070
back door because the language allows it
i mean you can't even right mad at them

4054
01:26:28,070 --> 01:26:28,080
i mean you can't even right mad at them
 

4055
01:26:28,080 --> 01:26:30,709
i mean you can't even right mad at them
and and so one of the things i did that

4056
01:26:30,709 --> 01:26:30,719
and and so one of the things i did that
 

4057
01:26:30,719 --> 01:26:31,189
and and so one of the things i did that
that

4058
01:26:31,189 --> 01:26:31,199
that
 

4059
01:26:31,199 --> 01:26:33,510
that
on the one hand upset a bunch of people

4060
01:26:33,510 --> 01:26:33,520
on the one hand upset a bunch of people
 

4061
01:26:33,520 --> 01:26:36,470
on the one hand upset a bunch of people
is that i made it so that you really

4062
01:26:36,470 --> 01:26:36,480
is that i made it so that you really
 

4063
01:26:36,480 --> 01:26:37,110
is that i made it so that you really
couldn't

4064
01:26:37,110 --> 01:26:37,120
couldn't
 

4065
01:26:37,120 --> 01:26:38,950
couldn't
go through back doors right so so the

4066
01:26:38,950 --> 01:26:38,960
go through back doors right so so the
 

4067
01:26:38,960 --> 01:26:40,149
go through back doors right so so the
whole point of that

4068
01:26:40,149 --> 01:26:40,159
whole point of that
 

4069
01:26:40,159 --> 01:26:43,430
whole point of that
was to say if

4070
01:26:43,430 --> 01:26:43,440
was to say if
 

4071
01:26:43,440 --> 01:26:45,110
was to say if
you need you know if the interface here

4072
01:26:45,110 --> 01:26:45,120
you need you know if the interface here
 

4073
01:26:45,120 --> 01:26:47,030
you need you know if the interface here
isn't right

4074
01:26:47,030 --> 01:26:47,040
isn't right
 

4075
01:26:47,040 --> 01:26:49,750
isn't right
the wrong way to deal with that is is to

4076
01:26:49,750 --> 01:26:49,760
the wrong way to deal with that is is to
 

4077
01:26:49,760 --> 01:26:51,270
the wrong way to deal with that is is to
go through a back door yeah

4078
01:26:51,270 --> 01:26:51,280
go through a back door yeah
 

4079
01:26:51,280 --> 01:26:53,110
go through a back door yeah
the right way to deal with it is to walk

4080
01:26:53,110 --> 01:26:53,120
the right way to deal with it is to walk
 

4081
01:26:53,120 --> 01:26:54,550
the right way to deal with it is to walk
up to the developer of this thing and

4082
01:26:54,550 --> 01:26:54,560
up to the developer of this thing and
 

4083
01:26:54,560 --> 01:26:55,030
up to the developer of this thing and
say

4084
01:26:55,030 --> 01:26:55,040
say
 

4085
01:26:55,040 --> 01:26:58,390
say
uh change the interface fix it yep

4086
01:26:58,390 --> 01:26:58,400
uh change the interface fix it yep
 

4087
01:26:58,400 --> 01:27:00,149
uh change the interface fix it yep
right and so it was kind of like a

4088
01:27:00,149 --> 01:27:00,159
right and so it was kind of like a
 

4089
01:27:00,159 --> 01:27:01,590
right and so it was kind of like a
social engineering thing

4090
01:27:01,590 --> 01:27:01,600
social engineering thing
 

4091
01:27:01,600 --> 01:27:05,110
social engineering thing
yeah and um it's brilliant

4092
01:27:05,110 --> 01:27:05,120
yeah and um it's brilliant
 

4093
01:27:05,120 --> 01:27:07,350
yeah and um it's brilliant
and people ended up discovering that

4094
01:27:07,350 --> 01:27:07,360
and people ended up discovering that
 

4095
01:27:07,360 --> 01:27:08,149
and people ended up discovering that
that

4096
01:27:08,149 --> 01:27:08,159
that
 

4097
01:27:08,159 --> 01:27:11,750
that
really made a difference um in terms

4098
01:27:11,750 --> 01:27:11,760
really made a difference um in terms
 

4099
01:27:11,760 --> 01:27:13,830
really made a difference um in terms
of you know and and and a bunch of this

4100
01:27:13,830 --> 01:27:13,840
of you know and and and a bunch of this
 

4101
01:27:13,840 --> 01:27:15,270
of you know and and and a bunch of this
stuff you know if you're just like

4102
01:27:15,270 --> 01:27:15,280
stuff you know if you're just like
 

4103
01:27:15,280 --> 01:27:16,790
stuff you know if you're just like
screwing around writing your own

4104
01:27:16,790 --> 01:27:16,800
screwing around writing your own
 

4105
01:27:16,800 --> 01:27:20,709
screwing around writing your own
like you know class project scale stuff

4106
01:27:20,709 --> 01:27:20,719
like you know class project scale stuff
 

4107
01:27:20,719 --> 01:27:23,750
like you know class project scale stuff
a lot of stuff doesn't isn't quite so

4108
01:27:23,750 --> 01:27:23,760
a lot of stuff doesn't isn't quite so
 

4109
01:27:23,760 --> 01:27:27,590
a lot of stuff doesn't isn't quite so
so important because you know you're

4110
01:27:27,590 --> 01:27:27,600
so important because you know you're
 

4111
01:27:27,600 --> 01:27:31,350
so important because you know you're
you know both sides of the interface um

4112
01:27:31,350 --> 01:27:31,360
you know both sides of the interface um
 

4113
01:27:31,360 --> 01:27:33,750
you know both sides of the interface um
but you know when you're building you

4114
01:27:33,750 --> 01:27:33,760
but you know when you're building you
 

4115
01:27:33,760 --> 01:27:35,510
but you know when you're building you
know sort of

4116
01:27:35,510 --> 01:27:35,520
know sort of
 

4117
01:27:35,520 --> 01:27:37,590
know sort of
larger more complex pieces of software

4118
01:27:37,590 --> 01:27:37,600
larger more complex pieces of software
 

4119
01:27:37,600 --> 01:27:39,189
larger more complex pieces of software
that have a lot of people working on

4120
01:27:39,189 --> 01:27:39,199
that have a lot of people working on
 

4121
01:27:39,199 --> 01:27:39,830
that have a lot of people working on
them

4122
01:27:39,830 --> 01:27:39,840
them
 

4123
01:27:39,840 --> 01:27:41,430
them
and especially when they like span

4124
01:27:41,430 --> 01:27:41,440
and especially when they like span
 

4125
01:27:41,440 --> 01:27:44,830
and especially when they like span
organizations

4126
01:27:44,830 --> 01:27:44,840

 

4127
01:27:44,840 --> 01:27:46,790

um you know having

4128
01:27:46,790 --> 01:27:46,800
um you know having
 

4129
01:27:46,800 --> 01:27:50,310
um you know having
having really clear having clarity about

4130
01:27:50,310 --> 01:27:50,320
having really clear having clarity about
 

4131
01:27:50,320 --> 01:27:51,189
having really clear having clarity about
how that stuff

4132
01:27:51,189 --> 01:27:51,199
how that stuff
 

4133
01:27:51,199 --> 01:27:55,270
how that stuff
gets structured um saves your life yeah

4134
01:27:55,270 --> 01:27:55,280
gets structured um saves your life yeah
 

4135
01:27:55,280 --> 01:27:58,550
gets structured um saves your life yeah
um and you know especially

4136
01:27:58,550 --> 01:27:58,560
um and you know especially
 

4137
01:27:58,560 --> 01:28:00,310
um and you know especially
you know there's so much software that

4138
01:28:00,310 --> 01:28:00,320
you know there's so much software that
 

4139
01:28:00,320 --> 01:28:02,950
you know there's so much software that
is fundamentally untestable

4140
01:28:02,950 --> 01:28:02,960
is fundamentally untestable
 

4141
01:28:02,960 --> 01:28:06,470
is fundamentally untestable
you know and you know until you do the

4142
01:28:06,470 --> 01:28:06,480
you know and you know until you do the
 

4143
01:28:06,480 --> 01:28:08,070
you know and you know until you do the
real thing

4144
01:28:08,070 --> 01:28:08,080
real thing
 

4145
01:28:08,080 --> 01:28:10,709
real thing
it's better to write good code in the

4146
01:28:10,709 --> 01:28:10,719
it's better to write good code in the
 

4147
01:28:10,719 --> 01:28:11,830
it's better to write good code in the
beginning

4148
01:28:11,830 --> 01:28:11,840
beginning
 

4149
01:28:11,840 --> 01:28:13,590
beginning
as opposed to writing crappy code and

4150
01:28:13,590 --> 01:28:13,600
as opposed to writing crappy code and
 

4151
01:28:13,600 --> 01:28:15,270
as opposed to writing crappy code and
then trying to fix it and

4152
01:28:15,270 --> 01:28:15,280
then trying to fix it and
 

4153
01:28:15,280 --> 01:28:17,510
then trying to fix it and
yeah trying to scramble and figure out

4154
01:28:17,510 --> 01:28:17,520
yeah trying to scramble and figure out
 

4155
01:28:17,520 --> 01:28:19,590
yeah trying to scramble and figure out
and through testing figure out where the

4156
01:28:19,590 --> 01:28:19,600
and through testing figure out where the
 

4157
01:28:19,600 --> 01:28:20,310
and through testing figure out where the
bugs are

4158
01:28:20,310 --> 01:28:20,320
bugs are
 

4159
01:28:20,320 --> 01:28:23,350
bugs are
yeah it's just like it's like it's like

4160
01:28:23,350 --> 01:28:23,360
yeah it's just like it's like it's like
 

4161
01:28:23,360 --> 01:28:27,270
yeah it's just like it's like it's like
which shortcut caused that

4162
01:28:27,270 --> 01:28:27,280
which shortcut caused that
 

4163
01:28:27,280 --> 01:28:30,070
which shortcut caused that
rocket to not get where it was needed to

4164
01:28:30,070 --> 01:28:30,080
rocket to not get where it was needed to
 

4165
01:28:30,080 --> 01:28:31,590
rocket to not get where it was needed to
go

4166
01:28:31,590 --> 01:28:31,600
go
 

4167
01:28:31,600 --> 01:28:35,750

so i think one of the most beautiful

4168
01:28:35,750 --> 01:28:35,760
so i think one of the most beautiful
 

4169
01:28:35,760 --> 01:28:36,870
so i think one of the most beautiful
ideas

4170
01:28:36,870 --> 01:28:36,880
ideas
 

4171
01:28:36,880 --> 01:28:40,390
ideas
uh philosophically and technically is uh

4172
01:28:40,390 --> 01:28:40,400
uh philosophically and technically is uh
 

4173
01:28:40,400 --> 01:28:42,470

well again apologize to romanticize

4178
01:28:47,030 --> 01:28:47,040
well again apologize to romanticize
 

4179
01:28:47,040 --> 01:28:49,910
well again apologize to romanticize
things but uh

4180
01:28:49,910 --> 01:28:49,920

 

4181
01:28:49,920 --> 01:28:53,270

how did the idea of the jvm come to be

4182
01:28:53,270 --> 01:28:53,280
how did the idea of the jvm come to be
 

4183
01:28:53,280 --> 01:28:56,310
how did the idea of the jvm come to be
how to you radical of an idea it is

4184
01:28:56,310 --> 01:28:56,320
how to you radical of an idea it is
 

4185
01:28:56,320 --> 01:28:59,669
how to you radical of an idea it is
because it seems to me to be just

4186
01:28:59,669 --> 01:28:59,679
because it seems to me to be just
 

4187
01:28:59,679 --> 01:29:01,990
because it seems to me to be just
a really interesting idea in the history

4188
01:29:01,990 --> 01:29:02,000
a really interesting idea in the history
 

4189
01:29:02,000 --> 01:29:03,430
a really interesting idea in the history
of programming

4190
01:29:03,430 --> 01:29:03,440
of programming
 

4191
01:29:03,440 --> 01:29:06,629
of programming
so and what is it so the java virtual

4192
01:29:06,629 --> 01:29:06,639
so and what is it so the java virtual
 

4193
01:29:06,639 --> 01:29:08,550
so and what is it so the java virtual
machine

4194
01:29:08,550 --> 01:29:08,560
machine
 

4195
01:29:08,560 --> 01:29:12,790
machine
you can think of it in different ways

4196
01:29:12,790 --> 01:29:12,800
you can think of it in different ways
 

4197
01:29:12,800 --> 01:29:16,070
you can think of it in different ways
um because it was

4198
01:29:16,070 --> 01:29:16,080
um because it was
 

4199
01:29:16,080 --> 01:29:17,990
um because it was
carefully designed to have different

4200
01:29:17,990 --> 01:29:18,000
carefully designed to have different
 

4201
01:29:18,000 --> 01:29:19,750
carefully designed to have different
ways of viewing it

4202
01:29:19,750 --> 01:29:19,760
ways of viewing it
 

4203
01:29:19,760 --> 01:29:22,950
ways of viewing it
so one view of it that most people don't

4204
01:29:22,950 --> 01:29:22,960
so one view of it that most people don't
 

4205
01:29:22,960 --> 01:29:25,030
so one view of it that most people don't
really realize is there

4206
01:29:25,030 --> 01:29:25,040
really realize is there
 

4207
01:29:25,040 --> 01:29:29,030
really realize is there
is that you can

4208
01:29:29,030 --> 01:29:29,040

 

4209
01:29:29,040 --> 01:29:33,189

view it as sort of an encoding of

4210
01:29:33,189 --> 01:29:33,199
view it as sort of an encoding of
 

4211
01:29:33,199 --> 01:29:35,270
view it as sort of an encoding of
the abstract syntax tree in reverse

4212
01:29:35,270 --> 01:29:35,280
the abstract syntax tree in reverse
 

4213
01:29:35,280 --> 01:29:39,110
the abstract syntax tree in reverse
polish notation

4214
01:29:39,110 --> 01:29:39,120
polish notation
 

4215
01:29:39,120 --> 01:29:40,709
polish notation
i don't know if that makes any sense at

4216
01:29:40,709 --> 01:29:40,719
i don't know if that makes any sense at
 

4217
01:29:40,719 --> 01:29:42,790
i don't know if that makes any sense at
all i could explain it and that would

4218
01:29:42,790 --> 01:29:42,800
all i could explain it and that would
 

4219
01:29:42,800 --> 01:29:44,070
all i could explain it and that would
blow all of our time

4220
01:29:44,070 --> 01:29:44,080
blow all of our time
 

4221
01:29:44,080 --> 01:29:46,709
blow all of our time
yeah um but the other way to think of it

4222
01:29:46,709 --> 01:29:46,719
yeah um but the other way to think of it
 

4223
01:29:46,719 --> 01:29:47,110
yeah um but the other way to think of it
um

4224
01:29:47,110 --> 01:29:47,120
um
 

4225
01:29:47,120 --> 01:29:48,870
um
and the way that it ends up being

4226
01:29:48,870 --> 01:29:48,880
and the way that it ends up being
 

4227
01:29:48,880 --> 01:29:51,590
and the way that it ends up being
explained is that

4228
01:29:51,590 --> 01:29:51,600
explained is that
 

4229
01:29:51,600 --> 01:29:54,390
explained is that
it's it's like the the instruction set

4230
01:29:54,390 --> 01:29:54,400
it's it's like the the instruction set
 

4231
01:29:54,400 --> 01:29:55,030
it's it's like the the instruction set
of an

4232
01:29:55,030 --> 01:29:55,040
of an
 

4233
01:29:55,040 --> 01:29:58,390
of an
abstract machine that's designed such

4234
01:29:58,390 --> 01:29:58,400
abstract machine that's designed such
 

4235
01:29:58,400 --> 01:29:59,669
abstract machine that's designed such
that you can

4236
01:29:59,669 --> 01:29:59,679
that you can
 

4237
01:29:59,679 --> 01:30:01,830
that you can
translate that abstract machine to a

4238
01:30:01,830 --> 01:30:01,840
translate that abstract machine to a
 

4239
01:30:01,840 --> 01:30:03,830
translate that abstract machine to a
physical machine

4240
01:30:03,830 --> 01:30:03,840
physical machine
 

4241
01:30:03,840 --> 01:30:07,750
physical machine
and the reason that that's important

4242
01:30:07,750 --> 01:30:07,760
and the reason that that's important
 

4243
01:30:07,760 --> 01:30:10,310
and the reason that that's important
so if you wind back to the early 90s

4244
01:30:10,310 --> 01:30:10,320
so if you wind back to the early 90s
 

4245
01:30:10,320 --> 01:30:12,390
so if you wind back to the early 90s
when we were talking to all of these

4246
01:30:12,390 --> 01:30:12,400
when we were talking to all of these
 

4247
01:30:12,400 --> 01:30:15,669
when we were talking to all of these
these companies doing consumer

4248
01:30:15,669 --> 01:30:15,679
these companies doing consumer
 

4249
01:30:15,679 --> 01:30:18,070
these companies doing consumer
electronics

4250
01:30:18,070 --> 01:30:18,080
electronics
 

4251
01:30:18,080 --> 01:30:22,390
electronics
and you talked to the purchasing people

4252
01:30:22,390 --> 01:30:22,400

 

4253
01:30:22,400 --> 01:30:24,229

there were interesting conversations

4254
01:30:24,229 --> 01:30:24,239
there were interesting conversations
 

4255
01:30:24,239 --> 01:30:26,149
there were interesting conversations
with purchasing

4256
01:30:26,149 --> 01:30:26,159
with purchasing
 

4257
01:30:26,159 --> 01:30:29,430
with purchasing
um so if you look at how you know these

4258
01:30:29,430 --> 01:30:29,440
um so if you look at how you know these
 

4259
01:30:29,440 --> 01:30:31,830
um so if you look at how you know these
you know these devices come together

4260
01:30:31,830 --> 01:30:31,840
you know these devices come together
 

4261
01:30:31,840 --> 01:30:35,030
you know these devices come together
they're sheet metal and gears and

4262
01:30:35,030 --> 01:30:35,040
they're sheet metal and gears and
 

4263
01:30:35,040 --> 01:30:37,030
they're sheet metal and gears and
circuit boards and capacitors and

4264
01:30:37,030 --> 01:30:37,040
circuit boards and capacitors and
 

4265
01:30:37,040 --> 01:30:38,310
circuit boards and capacitors and
resistors and

4266
01:30:38,310 --> 01:30:38,320
resistors and
 

4267
01:30:38,320 --> 01:30:42,550
resistors and
stuff and

4268
01:30:42,550 --> 01:30:42,560
stuff and
 

4269
01:30:42,560 --> 01:30:45,830
stuff and
everything you buy has multiple sources

4270
01:30:45,830 --> 01:30:45,840
everything you buy has multiple sources
 

4271
01:30:45,840 --> 01:30:49,110
everything you buy has multiple sources
right so you can buy a capacitor

4272
01:30:49,110 --> 01:30:49,120
right so you can buy a capacitor
 

4273
01:30:49,120 --> 01:30:51,750
right so you can buy a capacitor
from here you can buy a capacitor from

4274
01:30:51,750 --> 01:30:51,760
from here you can buy a capacitor from
 

4275
01:30:51,760 --> 01:30:52,790
from here you can buy a capacitor from
there

4276
01:30:52,790 --> 01:30:52,800
there
 

4277
01:30:52,800 --> 01:30:55,669
there
and you've got kind of a market so you

4278
01:30:55,669 --> 01:30:55,679
and you've got kind of a market so you
 

4279
01:30:55,679 --> 01:30:56,950
and you've got kind of a market so you
know so that the

4280
01:30:56,950 --> 01:30:56,960
know so that the
 

4281
01:30:56,960 --> 01:30:58,950
know so that the
you can actually get a decent price for

4282
01:30:58,950 --> 01:30:58,960
you can actually get a decent price for
 

4283
01:30:58,960 --> 01:31:01,189
you can actually get a decent price for
a capacitor

4284
01:31:01,189 --> 01:31:01,199
a capacitor
 

4285
01:31:01,199 --> 01:31:05,030
a capacitor
um but

4286
01:31:05,030 --> 01:31:05,040
um but
 

4287
01:31:05,040 --> 01:31:13,030
um but
cpus and particularly in the early 90s

4288
01:31:13,030 --> 01:31:13,040

 

4289
01:31:13,040 --> 01:31:15,510

cpus were all different and all

4290
01:31:15,510 --> 01:31:15,520
cpus were all different and all
 

4291
01:31:15,520 --> 01:31:17,590
cpus were all different and all
proprietary

4292
01:31:17,590 --> 01:31:17,600
proprietary
 

4293
01:31:17,600 --> 01:31:22,629
proprietary
so if you use the chip from intel

4294
01:31:22,629 --> 01:31:22,639

 

4295
01:31:22,639 --> 01:31:25,590

you had to be an intel customer for the

4296
01:31:25,590 --> 01:31:25,600
you had to be an intel customer for the
 

4297
01:31:25,600 --> 01:31:27,990
you had to be an intel customer for the
end of till the end of time

4298
01:31:27,990 --> 01:31:28,000
end of till the end of time
 

4299
01:31:28,000 --> 01:31:31,110
end of till the end of time
because if you wrote a bunch of software

4300
01:31:31,110 --> 01:31:31,120
because if you wrote a bunch of software
 

4301
01:31:31,120 --> 01:31:34,550
because if you wrote a bunch of software
you know when you wrote software using

4302
01:31:34,550 --> 01:31:34,560
you know when you wrote software using
 

4303
01:31:34,560 --> 01:31:37,350
you know when you wrote software using
whatever technique you wanted and c was

4304
01:31:37,350 --> 01:31:37,360
whatever technique you wanted and c was
 

4305
01:31:37,360 --> 01:31:38,550
whatever technique you wanted and c was
particularly bad

4306
01:31:38,550 --> 01:31:38,560
particularly bad
 

4307
01:31:38,560 --> 01:31:43,030
particularly bad
about this because there was a lot of

4308
01:31:43,030 --> 01:31:43,040
about this because there was a lot of
 

4309
01:31:43,040 --> 01:31:46,070
about this because there was a lot of
properties of the underlying machine

4310
01:31:46,070 --> 01:31:46,080
properties of the underlying machine
 

4311
01:31:46,080 --> 01:31:49,270
properties of the underlying machine
that came through so if you're stuck so

4312
01:31:49,270 --> 01:31:49,280
that came through so if you're stuck so
 

4313
01:31:49,280 --> 01:31:50,629
that came through so if you're stuck so
the code you wrote you were stuck to

4314
01:31:50,629 --> 01:31:50,639
the code you wrote you were stuck to
 

4315
01:31:50,639 --> 01:31:52,229
the code you wrote you were stuck to
that particular machine you were stuck

4316
01:31:52,229 --> 01:31:52,239
that particular machine you were stuck
 

4317
01:31:52,239 --> 01:31:54,149
that particular machine you were stuck
to that particular machine

4318
01:31:54,149 --> 01:31:54,159
to that particular machine
 

4319
01:31:54,159 --> 01:31:56,870
to that particular machine
which meant that they couldn't decide

4320
01:31:56,870 --> 01:31:56,880
which meant that they couldn't decide
 

4321
01:31:56,880 --> 01:31:57,750
which meant that they couldn't decide
you know

4322
01:31:57,750 --> 01:31:57,760
you know
 

4323
01:31:57,760 --> 01:32:01,430
you know
intel is screwing us um

4324
01:32:01,430 --> 01:32:01,440
intel is screwing us um
 

4325
01:32:01,440 --> 01:32:04,629
intel is screwing us um
i'll start buying chips from

4326
01:32:04,629 --> 01:32:04,639
i'll start buying chips from
 

4327
01:32:04,639 --> 01:32:08,149
i'll start buying chips from
you know bob's better chips

4328
01:32:08,149 --> 01:32:08,159
you know bob's better chips
 

4329
01:32:08,159 --> 01:32:11,350
you know bob's better chips
this drove the like the purchasing

4330
01:32:11,350 --> 01:32:11,360
this drove the like the purchasing
 

4331
01:32:11,360 --> 01:32:11,990
this drove the like the purchasing
people

4332
01:32:11,990 --> 01:32:12,000
people
 

4333
01:32:12,000 --> 01:32:15,750
people
absolutely insane

4334
01:32:15,750 --> 01:32:15,760

 

4335
01:32:15,760 --> 01:32:17,910

that that they would they were welded

4336
01:32:17,910 --> 01:32:17,920
that that they would they were welded
 

4337
01:32:17,920 --> 01:32:20,310
that that they would they were welded
into this decision

4338
01:32:20,310 --> 01:32:20,320
into this decision
 

4339
01:32:20,320 --> 01:32:21,510
into this decision
and it would have they would have to

4340
01:32:21,510 --> 01:32:21,520
and it would have they would have to
 

4341
01:32:21,520 --> 01:32:24,229
and it would have they would have to
make this decision before the first line

4342
01:32:24,229 --> 01:32:24,239
make this decision before the first line
 

4343
01:32:24,239 --> 01:32:25,750
make this decision before the first line
of software was written

4344
01:32:25,750 --> 01:32:25,760
of software was written
 

4345
01:32:25,760 --> 01:32:27,270
of software was written
it's funny that you're talking about the

4346
01:32:27,270 --> 01:32:27,280
it's funny that you're talking about the
 

4347
01:32:27,280 --> 01:32:28,629
it's funny that you're talking about the
purchasing people so that's one

4348
01:32:28,629 --> 01:32:28,639
purchasing people so that's one
 

4349
01:32:28,639 --> 01:32:29,830
purchasing people so that's one
perspective right

4350
01:32:29,830 --> 01:32:29,840
perspective right
 

4351
01:32:29,840 --> 01:32:31,990
perspective right
it's a you could there's a lot of other

4352
01:32:31,990 --> 01:32:32,000
it's a you could there's a lot of other
 

4353
01:32:32,000 --> 01:32:33,830
it's a you could there's a lot of other
perspectives that all probably hated

4354
01:32:33,830 --> 01:32:33,840
perspectives that all probably hated
 

4355
01:32:33,840 --> 01:32:35,110
perspectives that all probably hated
this idea

4356
01:32:35,110 --> 01:32:35,120
this idea
 

4357
01:32:35,120 --> 01:32:37,590
this idea
right but from a technical aspect just

4358
01:32:37,590 --> 01:32:37,600
right but from a technical aspect just
 

4359
01:32:37,600 --> 01:32:38,390
right but from a technical aspect just
like

4360
01:32:38,390 --> 01:32:38,400
like
 

4361
01:32:38,400 --> 01:32:41,590
like
the creation of an abstraction layer

4362
01:32:41,590 --> 01:32:41,600
the creation of an abstraction layer
 

4363
01:32:41,600 --> 01:32:44,550
the creation of an abstraction layer
that's uh agnostic to the underlying

4364
01:32:44,550 --> 01:32:44,560
that's uh agnostic to the underlying
 

4365
01:32:44,560 --> 01:32:46,149
that's uh agnostic to the underlying
machine

4366
01:32:46,149 --> 01:32:46,159
machine
 

4367
01:32:46,159 --> 01:32:48,229
machine
from the perspective of the developer i

4368
01:32:48,229 --> 01:32:48,239
from the perspective of the developer i
 

4369
01:32:48,239 --> 01:32:49,910
from the perspective of the developer i
mean it's brilliant

4370
01:32:49,910 --> 01:32:49,920
mean it's brilliant
 

4371
01:32:49,920 --> 01:32:53,430
mean it's brilliant
right well and and and and

4372
01:32:53,430 --> 01:32:53,440
right well and and and and
 

4373
01:32:53,440 --> 01:32:55,430
right well and and and and
you know you know so that's like across

4374
01:32:55,430 --> 01:32:55,440
you know you know so that's like across
 

4375
01:32:55,440 --> 01:32:56,870
you know you know so that's like across
the spectrum of of

4376
01:32:56,870 --> 01:32:56,880
the spectrum of of
 

4377
01:32:56,880 --> 01:32:59,110
the spectrum of of
providers of chips but then there's also

4378
01:32:59,110 --> 01:32:59,120
providers of chips but then there's also
 

4379
01:32:59,120 --> 01:33:00,229
providers of chips but then there's also
the the time

4380
01:33:00,229 --> 01:33:00,239
the the time
 

4381
01:33:00,239 --> 01:33:03,750
the the time
thing because um you know as you went

4382
01:33:03,750 --> 01:33:03,760
thing because um you know as you went
 

4383
01:33:03,760 --> 01:33:05,189
thing because um you know as you went
from one generation to the next

4384
01:33:05,189 --> 01:33:05,199
from one generation to the next
 

4385
01:33:05,199 --> 01:33:06,790
from one generation to the next
generation to the next generation they

4386
01:33:06,790 --> 01:33:06,800
generation to the next generation they
 

4387
01:33:06,800 --> 01:33:07,750
generation to the next generation they
were all different

4388
01:33:07,750 --> 01:33:07,760
were all different
 

4389
01:33:07,760 --> 01:33:09,350
were all different
and you would often have to rewrite your

4390
01:33:09,350 --> 01:33:09,360
and you would often have to rewrite your
 

4391
01:33:09,360 --> 01:33:10,790
and you would often have to rewrite your
software i mean

4392
01:33:10,790 --> 01:33:10,800
software i mean
 

4393
01:33:10,800 --> 01:33:13,750
software i mean
generations of uh cp of machines of

4394
01:33:13,750 --> 01:33:13,760
generations of uh cp of machines of
 

4395
01:33:13,760 --> 01:33:14,629
generations of uh cp of machines of
different kinds

4396
01:33:14,629 --> 01:33:14,639
different kinds
 

4397
01:33:14,639 --> 01:33:17,990
different kinds
yeah so so like like like one of the

4398
01:33:17,990 --> 01:33:18,000
yeah so so like like like one of the
 

4399
01:33:18,000 --> 01:33:19,830
yeah so so like like like one of the
things that sucked about a year out of

4400
01:33:19,830 --> 01:33:19,840
things that sucked about a year out of
 

4401
01:33:19,840 --> 01:33:21,750
things that sucked about a year out of
my life was when

4402
01:33:21,750 --> 01:33:21,760
my life was when
 

4403
01:33:21,760 --> 01:33:25,470
my life was when
sun went from the the motorola

4404
01:33:25,470 --> 01:33:25,480
sun went from the the motorola
 

4405
01:33:25,480 --> 01:33:28,990
sun went from the the motorola
68010 processor to the

4406
01:33:28,990 --> 01:33:29,000
68010 processor to the
 

4407
01:33:29,000 --> 01:33:32,470
68010 processor to the
68020 processor then they had a number

4408
01:33:32,470 --> 01:33:32,480
68020 processor then they had a number
 

4409
01:33:32,480 --> 01:33:33,750
68020 processor then they had a number
of differences

4410
01:33:33,750 --> 01:33:33,760
of differences
 

4411
01:33:33,760 --> 01:33:37,030
of differences
and one of them hit us really hard and i

4412
01:33:37,030 --> 01:33:37,040
and one of them hit us really hard and i
 

4413
01:33:37,040 --> 01:33:38,870
and one of them hit us really hard and i
ended up being

4414
01:33:38,870 --> 01:33:38,880
ended up being
 

4415
01:33:38,880 --> 01:33:43,270
ended up being
the the point guy on the worst case of

4416
01:33:43,270 --> 01:33:43,280
the the point guy on the worst case of
 

4417
01:33:43,280 --> 01:33:44,870
the the point guy on the worst case of
where

4418
01:33:44,870 --> 01:33:44,880
where
 

4419
01:33:44,880 --> 01:33:47,669
where
the new instruction cache architecture

4420
01:33:47,669 --> 01:33:47,679
the new instruction cache architecture
 

4421
01:33:47,679 --> 01:33:49,030
the new instruction cache architecture
heard us

4422
01:33:49,030 --> 01:33:49,040
heard us
 

4423
01:33:49,040 --> 01:33:52,070
heard us
well okay so i mean so when did this

4424
01:33:52,070 --> 01:33:52,080
well okay so i mean so when did this
 

4425
01:33:52,080 --> 01:33:54,149
well okay so i mean so when did this
idea i mean okay so yeah you you

4426
01:33:54,149 --> 01:33:54,159
idea i mean okay so yeah you you
 

4427
01:33:54,159 --> 01:33:56,310
idea i mean okay so yeah you you
articulate a really clear

4428
01:33:56,310 --> 01:33:56,320
articulate a really clear
 

4429
01:33:56,320 --> 01:33:59,110
articulate a really clear
fundamental problem in all of computing

4430
01:33:59,110 --> 01:33:59,120
fundamental problem in all of computing
 

4431
01:33:59,120 --> 01:33:59,830
fundamental problem in all of computing
but

4432
01:33:59,830 --> 01:33:59,840
but
 

4433
01:33:59,840 --> 01:34:03,030
but
how where do you get the guts to think

4434
01:34:03,030 --> 01:34:03,040
how where do you get the guts to think
 

4435
01:34:03,040 --> 01:34:05,750
how where do you get the guts to think
we can actually solve this you know in

4436
01:34:05,750 --> 01:34:05,760
we can actually solve this you know in
 

4437
01:34:05,760 --> 01:34:07,910
we can actually solve this you know in
our conversations with

4438
01:34:07,910 --> 01:34:07,920
our conversations with
 

4439
01:34:07,920 --> 01:34:09,510
our conversations with
you know all these vendors you know

4440
01:34:09,510 --> 01:34:09,520
you know all these vendors you know
 

4441
01:34:09,520 --> 01:34:11,750
you know all these vendors you know
these these problems started to

4442
01:34:11,750 --> 01:34:11,760
these these problems started to
 

4443
01:34:11,760 --> 01:34:17,270
these these problems started to
to show up and

4444
01:34:17,270 --> 01:34:17,280

 

4445
01:34:17,280 --> 01:34:21,270

i kind of had this epiphany

4446
01:34:21,270 --> 01:34:21,280

 

4447
01:34:21,280 --> 01:34:25,189

because it reminded me of

4448
01:34:25,189 --> 01:34:25,199
because it reminded me of
 

4449
01:34:25,199 --> 01:34:28,790
because it reminded me of
a summer job that i had had in grad

4450
01:34:28,790 --> 01:34:28,800
a summer job that i had had in grad
 

4451
01:34:28,800 --> 01:34:31,350
a summer job that i had had in grad
school

4452
01:34:31,350 --> 01:34:31,360

 

4453
01:34:31,360 --> 01:34:34,629

so

4454
01:34:34,629 --> 01:34:34,639

 

4455
01:34:34,639 --> 01:34:37,590

back in grad school my my thesis advisor

4456
01:34:37,590 --> 01:34:37,600
back in grad school my my thesis advisor
 

4457
01:34:37,600 --> 01:34:40,149
back in grad school my my thesis advisor
well i had two thesis advisors

4458
01:34:40,149 --> 01:34:40,159
well i had two thesis advisors
 

4459
01:34:40,159 --> 01:34:43,750
well i had two thesis advisors
for bizarre reasons um one of them was a

4460
01:34:43,750 --> 01:34:43,760
for bizarre reasons um one of them was a
 

4461
01:34:43,760 --> 01:34:45,830
for bizarre reasons um one of them was a
guy named raj reddy the other one was

4462
01:34:45,830 --> 01:34:45,840
guy named raj reddy the other one was
 

4463
01:34:45,840 --> 01:34:47,590
guy named raj reddy the other one was
bob sproul

4464
01:34:47,590 --> 01:34:47,600
bob sproul
 

4465
01:34:47,600 --> 01:34:50,870
bob sproul
um and

4466
01:34:50,870 --> 01:34:50,880

 

4467
01:34:50,880 --> 01:34:53,990

raj i love ra i really love both of them

4468
01:34:53,990 --> 01:34:54,000
raj i love ra i really love both of them
 

4469
01:34:54,000 --> 01:34:58,830
raj i love ra i really love both of them
but right amazing so

4470
01:34:58,830 --> 01:34:58,840

 

4471
01:34:58,840 --> 01:35:01,430

the the department had bought

4472
01:35:01,430 --> 01:35:01,440
the the department had bought
 

4473
01:35:01,440 --> 01:35:06,310
the the department had bought
a bunch of like early workstations

4474
01:35:06,310 --> 01:35:06,320
a bunch of like early workstations
 

4475
01:35:06,320 --> 01:35:08,390
a bunch of like early workstations
from a company called three rivers

4476
01:35:08,390 --> 01:35:08,400
from a company called three rivers
 

4477
01:35:08,400 --> 01:35:11,270
from a company called three rivers
computer company

4478
01:35:11,270 --> 01:35:11,280
computer company
 

4479
01:35:11,280 --> 01:35:13,430
computer company
and three rivers computer company was a

4480
01:35:13,430 --> 01:35:13,440
and three rivers computer company was a
 

4481
01:35:13,440 --> 01:35:15,510
and three rivers computer company was a
bunch of electrical engineers who wanted

4482
01:35:15,510 --> 01:35:15,520
bunch of electrical engineers who wanted
 

4483
01:35:15,520 --> 01:35:19,030
bunch of electrical engineers who wanted
to do as little software as possible

4484
01:35:19,030 --> 01:35:19,040
to do as little software as possible
 

4485
01:35:19,040 --> 01:35:21,990
to do as little software as possible
so um they knew that they'd need to have

4486
01:35:21,990 --> 01:35:22,000
so um they knew that they'd need to have
 

4487
01:35:22,000 --> 01:35:24,070
so um they knew that they'd need to have
like compilers and os and stuff like

4488
01:35:24,070 --> 01:35:24,080
like compilers and os and stuff like
 

4489
01:35:24,080 --> 01:35:25,430
like compilers and os and stuff like
that and they didn't want to do any of

4490
01:35:25,430 --> 01:35:25,440
that and they didn't want to do any of
 

4491
01:35:25,440 --> 01:35:26,629
that and they didn't want to do any of
that

4492
01:35:26,629 --> 01:35:26,639
that
 

4493
01:35:26,639 --> 01:35:28,709
that
and they wanted to do that for as close

4494
01:35:28,709 --> 01:35:28,719
and they wanted to do that for as close
 

4495
01:35:28,719 --> 01:35:31,189
and they wanted to do that for as close
to zero money as possible

4496
01:35:31,189 --> 01:35:31,199
to zero money as possible
 

4497
01:35:31,199 --> 01:35:35,510
to zero money as possible
so um

4498
01:35:35,510 --> 01:35:35,520

 

4499
01:35:35,520 --> 01:35:37,430

what they did was they they built a

4500
01:35:37,430 --> 01:35:37,440
what they did was they they built a
 

4501
01:35:37,440 --> 01:35:39,430
what they did was they they built a
machine whose instruction set

4502
01:35:39,430 --> 01:35:39,440
machine whose instruction set
 

4503
01:35:39,440 --> 01:35:43,109
machine whose instruction set
was um the

4504
01:35:43,109 --> 01:35:43,119
was um the
 

4505
01:35:43,119 --> 01:35:46,229
was um the
was literally the byte code for ucsd

4506
01:35:46,229 --> 01:35:46,239
was literally the byte code for ucsd
 

4507
01:35:46,239 --> 01:35:47,350
was literally the byte code for ucsd
pascal

4508
01:35:47,350 --> 01:35:47,360
pascal
 

4509
01:35:47,360 --> 01:35:50,470
pascal
the p code

4510
01:35:50,470 --> 01:35:50,480
the p code
 

4511
01:35:50,480 --> 01:35:56,790
the p code
and so we had a bunch of software

4512
01:35:56,790 --> 01:35:56,800

 

4513
01:35:56,800 --> 01:35:59,430

that was that was written for this

4514
01:35:59,430 --> 01:35:59,440
that was that was written for this
 

4515
01:35:59,440 --> 01:36:02,950
that was that was written for this
machine

4516
01:36:02,950 --> 01:36:02,960

 

4517
01:36:02,960 --> 01:36:06,229

and for various reasons you know the

4518
01:36:06,229 --> 01:36:06,239
and for various reasons you know the
 

4519
01:36:06,239 --> 01:36:08,229
and for various reasons you know the
company wasn't doing terrifically well

4520
01:36:08,229 --> 01:36:08,239
company wasn't doing terrifically well
 

4521
01:36:08,239 --> 01:36:09,590
company wasn't doing terrifically well
we had all the software on these

4522
01:36:09,590 --> 01:36:09,600
we had all the software on these
 

4523
01:36:09,600 --> 01:36:11,270
we had all the software on these
machines and we wanted it to run on

4524
01:36:11,270 --> 01:36:11,280
machines and we wanted it to run on
 

4525
01:36:11,280 --> 01:36:12,629
machines and we wanted it to run on
other machines

4526
01:36:12,629 --> 01:36:12,639
other machines
 

4527
01:36:12,639 --> 01:36:16,470
other machines
principally the backs and

4528
01:36:16,470 --> 01:36:16,480
principally the backs and
 

4529
01:36:16,480 --> 01:36:19,590
principally the backs and
um

4530
01:36:19,590 --> 01:36:19,600

 

4531
01:36:19,600 --> 01:36:23,030

and so raj asked me if i could come up

4532
01:36:23,030 --> 01:36:23,040
and so raj asked me if i could come up
 

4533
01:36:23,040 --> 01:36:24,950
and so raj asked me if i could come up
with a way

4534
01:36:24,950 --> 01:36:24,960
with a way
 

4535
01:36:24,960 --> 01:36:27,350
with a way
to port all of this software and

4536
01:36:27,350 --> 01:36:27,360
to port all of this software and
 

4537
01:36:27,360 --> 01:36:28,470
to port all of this software and
translate from the

4538
01:36:28,470 --> 01:36:28,480
translate from the
 

4539
01:36:28,480 --> 01:36:31,830
translate from the
from from from the the the the perk

4540
01:36:31,830 --> 01:36:31,840
from from from the the the the perk
 

4541
01:36:31,840 --> 01:36:32,550
from from from the the the the perk
machines

4542
01:36:32,550 --> 01:36:32,560
machines
 

4543
01:36:32,560 --> 01:36:35,910
machines
to vax's and

4544
01:36:35,910 --> 01:36:35,920
to vax's and
 

4545
01:36:35,920 --> 01:36:39,669
to vax's and
and i think he you know what he had in

4546
01:36:39,669 --> 01:36:39,679
and i think he you know what he had in
 

4547
01:36:39,679 --> 01:36:41,430
and i think he you know what he had in
mind was something

4548
01:36:41,430 --> 01:36:41,440
mind was something
 

4549
01:36:41,440 --> 01:36:45,750
mind was something
that would translate from like pascal

4550
01:36:45,750 --> 01:36:45,760
that would translate from like pascal
 

4551
01:36:45,760 --> 01:36:50,149
that would translate from like pascal
to c or pascal to

4552
01:36:50,149 --> 01:36:50,159
to c or pascal to
 

4553
01:36:50,159 --> 01:36:51,830
to c or pascal to
actually at those times pretty much it

4554
01:36:51,830 --> 01:36:51,840
actually at those times pretty much it
 

4555
01:36:51,840 --> 01:36:54,149
actually at those times pretty much it
was you could translate to c

4556
01:36:54,149 --> 01:36:54,159
was you could translate to c
 

4557
01:36:54,159 --> 01:36:56,629
was you could translate to c
or c and if you didn't like translating

4558
01:36:56,629 --> 01:36:56,639
or c and if you didn't like translating
 

4559
01:36:56,639 --> 01:36:57,430
or c and if you didn't like translating
to c you could

4560
01:36:57,430 --> 01:36:57,440
to c you could
 

4561
01:36:57,440 --> 01:37:00,790
to c you could
translate to c um

4562
01:37:00,790 --> 01:37:00,800
translate to c um
 

4563
01:37:00,800 --> 01:37:02,629
translate to c um
there was you know it's you know it's

4564
01:37:02,629 --> 01:37:02,639
there was you know it's you know it's
 

4565
01:37:02,639 --> 01:37:04,229
there was you know it's you know it's
like the the henry ford

4566
01:37:04,229 --> 01:37:04,239
like the the henry ford
 

4567
01:37:04,239 --> 01:37:06,070
like the the henry ford
you know any color you wanted just as

4568
01:37:06,070 --> 01:37:06,080
you know any color you wanted just as
 

4569
01:37:06,080 --> 01:37:07,750
you know any color you wanted just as
long as it's black

4570
01:37:07,750 --> 01:37:07,760
long as it's black
 

4571
01:37:07,760 --> 01:37:12,470
long as it's black
um and and i went

4572
01:37:12,470 --> 01:37:12,480
um and and i went
 

4573
01:37:12,480 --> 01:37:16,550
um and and i went
that's really hard um

4574
01:37:16,550 --> 01:37:16,560
that's really hard um
 

4575
01:37:16,560 --> 01:37:18,950
that's really hard um
and and i and i noticed that you know

4576
01:37:18,950 --> 01:37:18,960
and and i and i noticed that you know
 

4577
01:37:18,960 --> 01:37:19,750
and and i and i noticed that you know
and i was like

4578
01:37:19,750 --> 01:37:19,760
and i was like
 

4579
01:37:19,760 --> 01:37:23,189
and i was like
looking at stuff and i went oh i bet i

4580
01:37:23,189 --> 01:37:23,199
looking at stuff and i went oh i bet i
 

4581
01:37:23,199 --> 01:37:24,709
looking at stuff and i went oh i bet i
could rewrite

4582
01:37:24,709 --> 01:37:24,719
could rewrite
 

4583
01:37:24,719 --> 01:37:29,669
could rewrite
the p code into vax assembly code

4584
01:37:29,669 --> 01:37:29,679

 

4585
01:37:29,679 --> 01:37:33,430

and and then i started to realize that

4586
01:37:33,430 --> 01:37:33,440
and and then i started to realize that
 

4587
01:37:33,440 --> 01:37:35,510
and and then i started to realize that
you know there were some properties of p

4588
01:37:35,510 --> 01:37:35,520
you know there were some properties of p
 

4589
01:37:35,520 --> 01:37:38,790
you know there were some properties of p
code that made that really easy some

4590
01:37:38,790 --> 01:37:38,800
code that made that really easy some
 

4591
01:37:38,800 --> 01:37:40,709
code that made that really easy some
properties that made it really hard

4592
01:37:40,709 --> 01:37:40,719
properties that made it really hard
 

4593
01:37:40,719 --> 01:37:42,950
properties that made it really hard
so i ended up writing this thing that

4594
01:37:42,950 --> 01:37:42,960
so i ended up writing this thing that
 

4595
01:37:42,960 --> 01:37:44,629
so i ended up writing this thing that
translated

4596
01:37:44,629 --> 01:37:44,639
translated
 

4597
01:37:44,639 --> 01:37:47,990
translated
from from p code on the three

4598
01:37:47,990 --> 01:37:48,000
from from p code on the three
 

4599
01:37:48,000 --> 01:37:51,590
from from p code on the three
rivers perks into assembly code on the

4600
01:37:51,590 --> 01:37:51,600
rivers perks into assembly code on the
 

4601
01:37:51,600 --> 01:37:53,830
rivers perks into assembly code on the
backs

4602
01:37:53,830 --> 01:37:53,840
backs
 

4603
01:37:53,840 --> 01:37:57,030
backs
and i actually got higher quality

4604
01:37:57,030 --> 01:37:57,040
and i actually got higher quality
 

4605
01:37:57,040 --> 01:38:00,149
and i actually got higher quality
code than the c compiler

4606
01:38:00,149 --> 01:38:00,159
code than the c compiler
 

4607
01:38:00,159 --> 01:38:02,470
code than the c compiler
and so so everything just went got

4608
01:38:02,470 --> 01:38:02,480
and so so everything just went got
 

4609
01:38:02,480 --> 01:38:04,390
and so so everything just went got
really fast it was really easy it was

4610
01:38:04,390 --> 01:38:04,400
really fast it was really easy it was
 

4611
01:38:04,400 --> 01:38:05,590
really fast it was really easy it was
like

4612
01:38:05,590 --> 01:38:05,600
like
 

4613
01:38:05,600 --> 01:38:08,629
like
wow i thought that was a sleazy hack

4614
01:38:08,629 --> 01:38:08,639
wow i thought that was a sleazy hack
 

4615
01:38:08,639 --> 01:38:12,070
wow i thought that was a sleazy hack
because i was lazy and in actual fact it

4616
01:38:12,070 --> 01:38:12,080
because i was lazy and in actual fact it
 

4617
01:38:12,080 --> 01:38:14,070
because i was lazy and in actual fact it
worked really well

4618
01:38:14,070 --> 01:38:14,080
worked really well
 

4619
01:38:14,080 --> 01:38:16,709
worked really well
and and i and i tried to convince people

4620
01:38:16,709 --> 01:38:16,719
and and i and i tried to convince people
 

4621
01:38:16,719 --> 01:38:19,750
and and i and i tried to convince people
that that was maybe a good thesis topic

4622
01:38:19,750 --> 01:38:19,760
that that was maybe a good thesis topic
 

4623
01:38:19,760 --> 01:38:23,830
that that was maybe a good thesis topic
yeah um and nobody was

4624
01:38:23,830 --> 01:38:23,840
yeah um and nobody was
 

4625
01:38:23,840 --> 01:38:26,709
yeah um and nobody was
it was you know it was like nah really

4626
01:38:26,709 --> 01:38:26,719
it was you know it was like nah really
 

4627
01:38:26,719 --> 01:38:27,030
it was you know it was like nah really
that's

4628
01:38:27,030 --> 01:38:27,040
that's
 

4629
01:38:27,040 --> 01:38:29,510
that's
i mean yeah it's really it's kind of a

4630
01:38:29,510 --> 01:38:29,520
i mean yeah it's really it's kind of a
 

4631
01:38:29,520 --> 01:38:30,709
i mean yeah it's really it's kind of a
brilliant idea

4632
01:38:30,709 --> 01:38:30,719
brilliant idea
 

4633
01:38:30,719 --> 01:38:34,149
brilliant idea
right maybe you didn't have the

4634
01:38:34,149 --> 01:38:34,159
right maybe you didn't have the
 

4635
01:38:34,159 --> 01:38:36,149
right maybe you didn't have the
you weren't able to articulate the big

4636
01:38:36,149 --> 01:38:36,159
you weren't able to articulate the big
 

4637
01:38:36,159 --> 01:38:37,189
you weren't able to articulate the big
picture of it

4638
01:38:37,189 --> 01:38:37,199
picture of it
 

4639
01:38:37,199 --> 01:38:40,709
picture of it
yeah and and i think you know that was a

4640
01:38:40,709 --> 01:38:40,719
yeah and and i think you know that was a
 

4641
01:38:40,719 --> 01:38:44,229
yeah and and i think you know that was a
um a key part but so then you know

4642
01:38:44,229 --> 01:38:44,239
um a key part but so then you know
 

4643
01:38:44,239 --> 01:38:47,510
um a key part but so then you know
clock comes forward a few years and it's

4644
01:38:47,510 --> 01:38:47,520
clock comes forward a few years and it's
 

4645
01:38:47,520 --> 01:38:48,709
clock comes forward a few years and it's
like

4646
01:38:48,709 --> 01:38:48,719
like
 

4647
01:38:48,719 --> 01:38:50,390
like
we've got to be able to you know that

4648
01:38:50,390 --> 01:38:50,400
we've got to be able to you know that
 

4649
01:38:50,400 --> 01:38:51,910
we've got to be able to you know that
you know the you know if they want to be

4650
01:38:51,910 --> 01:38:51,920
you know the you know if they want to be
 

4651
01:38:51,920 --> 01:38:52,790
you know the you know if they want to be
able to switch

4652
01:38:52,790 --> 01:38:52,800
able to switch
 

4653
01:38:52,800 --> 01:38:55,750
able to switch
from you know this weird microprocessor

4654
01:38:55,750 --> 01:38:55,760
from you know this weird microprocessor
 

4655
01:38:55,760 --> 01:38:56,629
from you know this weird microprocessor
to that

4656
01:38:56,629 --> 01:38:56,639
to that
 

4657
01:38:56,639 --> 01:38:58,070
to that
weird and totally different

4658
01:38:58,070 --> 01:38:58,080
weird and totally different
 

4659
01:38:58,080 --> 01:39:00,709
weird and totally different
microprocessor how do you do that

4660
01:39:00,709 --> 01:39:00,719
microprocessor how do you do that
 

4661
01:39:00,719 --> 01:39:04,870
microprocessor how do you do that
and i kind of went oh

4662
01:39:04,870 --> 01:39:04,880
and i kind of went oh
 

4663
01:39:04,880 --> 01:39:07,109
and i kind of went oh
maybe by doing something kind of in the

4664
01:39:07,109 --> 01:39:07,119
maybe by doing something kind of in the
 

4665
01:39:07,119 --> 01:39:09,669
maybe by doing something kind of in the
space of

4666
01:39:09,669 --> 01:39:09,679
space of
 

4667
01:39:09,679 --> 01:39:12,149
space of
you know pascal p code you know i could

4668
01:39:12,149 --> 01:39:12,159
you know pascal p code you know i could
 

4669
01:39:12,159 --> 01:39:12,709
you know pascal p code you know i could
do

4670
01:39:12,709 --> 01:39:12,719
do
 

4671
01:39:12,719 --> 01:39:15,910
do
like multiple translators and i spent

4672
01:39:15,910 --> 01:39:15,920
like multiple translators and i spent
 

4673
01:39:15,920 --> 01:39:17,270
like multiple translators and i spent
some time thinking about that and

4674
01:39:17,270 --> 01:39:17,280
some time thinking about that and
 

4675
01:39:17,280 --> 01:39:18,870
some time thinking about that and
thinking about you know what worked and

4676
01:39:18,870 --> 01:39:18,880
thinking about you know what worked and
 

4677
01:39:18,880 --> 01:39:20,070
thinking about you know what worked and
what didn't work when i

4678
01:39:20,070 --> 01:39:20,080
what didn't work when i
 

4679
01:39:20,080 --> 01:39:25,590
what didn't work when i
did the the the p code to vax translator

4680
01:39:25,590 --> 01:39:25,600
did the the the p code to vax translator
 

4681
01:39:25,600 --> 01:39:29,430
did the the the p code to vax translator
and um i talked to some of the folks who

4682
01:39:29,430 --> 01:39:29,440
and um i talked to some of the folks who
 

4683
01:39:29,440 --> 01:39:30,950
and um i talked to some of the folks who
were involved in small talk because

4684
01:39:30,950 --> 01:39:30,960
were involved in small talk because
 

4685
01:39:30,960 --> 01:39:34,790
were involved in small talk because
small talk also did about code

4686
01:39:34,790 --> 01:39:34,800

 

4687
01:39:34,800 --> 01:39:38,470

and and and then i kind of went

4688
01:39:38,470 --> 01:39:38,480
and and and then i kind of went
 

4689
01:39:38,480 --> 01:39:41,189
and and and then i kind of went
yeah let's that i want to do that yeah

4690
01:39:41,189 --> 01:39:41,199
yeah let's that i want to do that yeah
 

4691
01:39:41,199 --> 01:39:41,910
yeah let's that i want to do that yeah
because that act

4692
01:39:41,910 --> 01:39:41,920
because that act
 

4693
01:39:41,920 --> 01:39:44,149
because that act
you know and and it had the the other

4694
01:39:44,149 --> 01:39:44,159
you know and and it had the the other
 

4695
01:39:44,159 --> 01:39:45,910
you know and and it had the the other
advantage that

4696
01:39:45,910 --> 01:39:45,920
advantage that
 

4697
01:39:45,920 --> 01:39:48,070
advantage that
you could either interpret it or compile

4698
01:39:48,070 --> 01:39:48,080
you could either interpret it or compile
 

4699
01:39:48,080 --> 01:39:49,990
you could either interpret it or compile
it

4700
01:39:49,990 --> 01:39:50,000
it
 

4701
01:39:50,000 --> 01:39:54,149
it
and um interpreters are usually

4702
01:39:54,149 --> 01:39:54,159
and um interpreters are usually
 

4703
01:39:54,159 --> 01:39:57,510
and um interpreters are usually
easier to do but not as fast

4704
01:39:57,510 --> 01:39:57,520
easier to do but not as fast
 

4705
01:39:57,520 --> 01:40:01,669
easier to do but not as fast
as a compiler so i figured

4706
01:40:01,669 --> 01:40:01,679
as a compiler so i figured
 

4707
01:40:01,679 --> 01:40:05,990
as a compiler so i figured
good i can be lazy again um

4708
01:40:05,990 --> 01:40:06,000
good i can be lazy again um
 

4709
01:40:06,000 --> 01:40:07,510
good i can be lazy again um
you know you know sometimes i think that

4710
01:40:07,510 --> 01:40:07,520
you know you know sometimes i think that
 

4711
01:40:07,520 --> 01:40:09,669
you know you know sometimes i think that
most of my good ideas are

4712
01:40:09,669 --> 01:40:09,679
most of my good ideas are
 

4713
01:40:09,679 --> 01:40:13,669
most of my good ideas are
um driven by laziness and often i find

4714
01:40:13,669 --> 01:40:13,679
um driven by laziness and often i find
 

4715
01:40:13,679 --> 01:40:14,870
um driven by laziness and often i find
that people some of the people's

4716
01:40:14,870 --> 01:40:14,880
that people some of the people's
 

4717
01:40:14,880 --> 01:40:16,470
that people some of the people's
stupidest ideas are because they're

4718
01:40:16,470 --> 01:40:16,480
stupidest ideas are because they're
 

4719
01:40:16,480 --> 01:40:21,030
stupidest ideas are because they're
insufficiently lazy

4720
01:40:21,030 --> 01:40:21,040

 

4721
01:40:21,040 --> 01:40:22,790

yeah they just want to build something

4722
01:40:22,790 --> 01:40:22,800
yeah they just want to build something
 

4723
01:40:22,800 --> 01:40:24,550
yeah they just want to build something
really complicated it's like it doesn't

4724
01:40:24,550 --> 01:40:24,560
really complicated it's like it doesn't
 

4725
01:40:24,560 --> 01:40:26,709
really complicated it's like it doesn't
need to be that complicated

4726
01:40:26,709 --> 01:40:26,719
need to be that complicated
 

4727
01:40:26,719 --> 01:40:29,830
need to be that complicated
yeah and so and so that's how that came

4728
01:40:29,830 --> 01:40:29,840
yeah and so and so that's how that came
 

4729
01:40:29,840 --> 01:40:31,669
yeah and so and so that's how that came
out

4730
01:40:31,669 --> 01:40:31,679
out
 

4731
01:40:31,679 --> 01:40:34,790
out
and um you know but that also

4732
01:40:34,790 --> 01:40:34,800
and um you know but that also
 

4733
01:40:34,800 --> 01:40:38,149
and um you know but that also
turned into kind of a you know almost a

4734
01:40:38,149 --> 01:40:38,159
turned into kind of a you know almost a
 

4735
01:40:38,159 --> 01:40:40,709
turned into kind of a you know almost a
religious position on my part which was

4736
01:40:40,709 --> 01:40:40,719
religious position on my part which was
 

4737
01:40:40,719 --> 01:40:44,390
religious position on my part which was
which got me in in several other fights

4738
01:40:44,390 --> 01:40:44,400
which got me in in several other fights
 

4739
01:40:44,400 --> 01:40:46,629
which got me in in several other fights
so like like one of the things that was

4740
01:40:46,629 --> 01:40:46,639
so like like one of the things that was
 

4741
01:40:46,639 --> 01:40:48,310
so like like one of the things that was
a real

4742
01:40:48,310 --> 01:40:48,320
a real
 

4743
01:40:48,320 --> 01:40:50,629
a real
difference was the way that arithmetic

4744
01:40:50,629 --> 01:40:50,639
difference was the way that arithmetic
 

4745
01:40:50,639 --> 01:40:52,550
difference was the way that arithmetic
worked

4746
01:40:52,550 --> 01:40:52,560
worked
 

4747
01:40:52,560 --> 01:40:55,590
worked
um you know

4748
01:40:55,590 --> 01:40:55,600
um you know
 

4749
01:40:55,600 --> 01:40:58,629
um you know
once upon a time there were you know it

4750
01:40:58,629 --> 01:40:58,639
once upon a time there were you know it
 

4751
01:40:58,639 --> 01:41:00,310
once upon a time there were you know it
wasn't always just two's complement

4752
01:41:00,310 --> 01:41:00,320
wasn't always just two's complement
 

4753
01:41:00,320 --> 01:41:01,430
wasn't always just two's complement
arithmetic

4754
01:41:01,430 --> 01:41:01,440
arithmetic
 

4755
01:41:01,440 --> 01:41:02,950
arithmetic
there were some machines that had one's

4756
01:41:02,950 --> 01:41:02,960
there were some machines that had one's
 

4757
01:41:02,960 --> 01:41:04,870
there were some machines that had one's
complement arithmetic which was like

4758
01:41:04,870 --> 01:41:04,880
complement arithmetic which was like
 

4759
01:41:04,880 --> 01:41:08,870
complement arithmetic which was like
almost anything built by cdc um

4760
01:41:08,870 --> 01:41:08,880
almost anything built by cdc um
 

4761
01:41:08,880 --> 01:41:10,470
almost anything built by cdc um
and occasionally there were machines

4762
01:41:10,470 --> 01:41:10,480
and occasionally there were machines
 

4763
01:41:10,480 --> 01:41:13,109
and occasionally there were machines
that were decimal arithmetic

4764
01:41:13,109 --> 01:41:13,119
that were decimal arithmetic
 

4765
01:41:13,119 --> 01:41:17,270
that were decimal arithmetic
and and i was like this is crazy

4766
01:41:17,270 --> 01:41:17,280
and and i was like this is crazy
 

4767
01:41:17,280 --> 01:41:20,229
and and i was like this is crazy
you know pretty much two's complement

4768
01:41:20,229 --> 01:41:20,239
you know pretty much two's complement
 

4769
01:41:20,239 --> 01:41:22,629
you know pretty much two's complement
integer arithmetic has one

4770
01:41:22,629 --> 01:41:22,639
integer arithmetic has one
 

4771
01:41:22,639 --> 01:41:25,990
integer arithmetic has one
so just let's just do that

4772
01:41:25,990 --> 01:41:26,000
so just let's just do that
 

4773
01:41:26,000 --> 01:41:29,430
so just let's just do that
just to do that one of the other places

4774
01:41:29,430 --> 01:41:29,440
just to do that one of the other places
 

4775
01:41:29,440 --> 01:41:31,350
just to do that one of the other places
where there was a lot of variability was

4776
01:41:31,350 --> 01:41:31,360
where there was a lot of variability was
 

4777
01:41:31,360 --> 01:41:36,149
where there was a lot of variability was
in the way that floating point behaved

4778
01:41:36,149 --> 01:41:36,159

 

4779
01:41:36,159 --> 01:41:39,189

and that was causing people throughout

4780
01:41:39,189 --> 01:41:39,199
and that was causing people throughout
 

4781
01:41:39,199 --> 01:41:40,229
and that was causing people throughout
the

4782
01:41:40,229 --> 01:41:40,239
the
 

4783
01:41:40,239 --> 01:41:43,750
the
software industry much pain because you

4784
01:41:43,750 --> 01:41:43,760
software industry much pain because you
 

4785
01:41:43,760 --> 01:41:44,470
software industry much pain because you
couldn't

4786
01:41:44,470 --> 01:41:44,480
couldn't
 

4787
01:41:44,480 --> 01:41:47,270
couldn't
do a numerical computing library that

4788
01:41:47,270 --> 01:41:47,280
do a numerical computing library that
 

4789
01:41:47,280 --> 01:41:47,669
do a numerical computing library that
would

4790
01:41:47,669 --> 01:41:47,679
would
 

4791
01:41:47,679 --> 01:41:49,910
would
work on cdc and then have it work on an

4792
01:41:49,910 --> 01:41:49,920
work on cdc and then have it work on an
 

4793
01:41:49,920 --> 01:41:51,030
work on cdc and then have it work on an
ibm machine and

4794
01:41:51,030 --> 01:41:51,040
ibm machine and
 

4795
01:41:51,040 --> 01:41:54,709
ibm machine and
work on it on a deck machine um

4796
01:41:54,709 --> 01:41:54,719
work on it on a deck machine um
 

4797
01:41:54,719 --> 01:41:57,109
work on it on a deck machine um
and as a as a part of that whole

4798
01:41:57,109 --> 01:41:57,119
and as a as a part of that whole
 

4799
01:41:57,119 --> 01:41:59,109
and as a as a part of that whole
struggle there had been this

4800
01:41:59,109 --> 01:41:59,119
struggle there had been this
 

4801
01:41:59,119 --> 01:42:02,229
struggle there had been this
this big body of work on

4802
01:42:02,229 --> 01:42:02,239
this big body of work on
 

4803
01:42:02,239 --> 01:42:05,350
this big body of work on
on floating point standards

4804
01:42:05,350 --> 01:42:05,360
on floating point standards
 

4805
01:42:05,360 --> 01:42:07,990
on floating point standards
and this thing emerged that came to be

4806
01:42:07,990 --> 01:42:08,000
and this thing emerged that came to be
 

4807
01:42:08,000 --> 01:42:11,590
and this thing emerged that came to be
called ieee 754

4808
01:42:11,590 --> 01:42:11,600
called ieee 754
 

4809
01:42:11,600 --> 01:42:13,510
called ieee 754
which is the floating point standard

4810
01:42:13,510 --> 01:42:13,520
which is the floating point standard
 

4811
01:42:13,520 --> 01:42:15,350
which is the floating point standard
that pretty much has take

4812
01:42:15,350 --> 01:42:15,360
that pretty much has take
 

4813
01:42:15,360 --> 01:42:20,070
that pretty much has take
taken over the entire universe um

4814
01:42:20,070 --> 01:42:20,080
taken over the entire universe um
 

4815
01:42:20,080 --> 01:42:21,990
taken over the entire universe um
and and at the time i was doing java it

4816
01:42:21,990 --> 01:42:22,000
and and at the time i was doing java it
 

4817
01:42:22,000 --> 01:42:23,830
and and at the time i was doing java it
had pretty much completed taking over

4818
01:42:23,830 --> 01:42:23,840
had pretty much completed taking over
 

4819
01:42:23,840 --> 01:42:25,590
had pretty much completed taking over
the universe

4820
01:42:25,590 --> 01:42:25,600
the universe
 

4821
01:42:25,600 --> 01:42:27,430
the universe
there were still a few pockets of

4822
01:42:27,430 --> 01:42:27,440
there were still a few pockets of
 

4823
01:42:27,440 --> 01:42:29,590
there were still a few pockets of
holdouts but

4824
01:42:29,590 --> 01:42:29,600
holdouts but
 

4825
01:42:29,600 --> 01:42:31,990
holdouts but
i was like you know it's important to be

4826
01:42:31,990 --> 01:42:32,000
i was like you know it's important to be
 

4827
01:42:32,000 --> 01:42:35,590
i was like you know it's important to be
able to say what two plus two means

4828
01:42:35,590 --> 01:42:35,600
able to say what two plus two means
 

4829
01:42:35,600 --> 01:42:40,070
able to say what two plus two means
um yeah and and so i went

4830
01:42:40,070 --> 01:42:40,080
um yeah and and so i went
 

4831
01:42:40,080 --> 01:42:43,350
um yeah and and so i went
that um and

4832
01:42:43,350 --> 01:42:43,360
that um and
 

4833
01:42:43,360 --> 01:42:45,510
that um and
one of the ways that i got into fights

4834
01:42:45,510 --> 01:42:45,520
one of the ways that i got into fights
 

4835
01:42:45,520 --> 01:42:47,750
one of the ways that i got into fights
with people was that

4836
01:42:47,750 --> 01:42:47,760
with people was that
 

4837
01:42:47,760 --> 01:42:50,470
with people was that
there were a few machines that did not

4838
01:42:50,470 --> 01:42:50,480
there were a few machines that did not
 

4839
01:42:50,480 --> 01:42:51,030
there were a few machines that did not
implement

4840
01:42:51,030 --> 01:42:51,040
implement
 

4841
01:42:51,040 --> 01:42:55,270
implement
ieee 754 correctly

well of course that's that's all

4844
01:42:56,870 --> 01:42:56,880
well of course that's that's all
 

4845
01:42:56,880 --> 01:42:58,390
well of course that's that's all
short-term kind of fights

4846
01:42:58,390 --> 01:42:58,400
short-term kind of fights
 

4847
01:42:58,400 --> 01:43:00,790
short-term kind of fights
i think in the in the long term i think

4848
01:43:00,790 --> 01:43:00,800
i think in the in the long term i think
 

4849
01:43:00,800 --> 01:43:01,990
i think in the in the long term i think
this vision is

4850
01:43:01,990 --> 01:43:02,000
this vision is
 

4851
01:43:02,000 --> 01:43:04,709
this vision is
won out yeah and and i think it's you

4852
01:43:04,709 --> 01:43:04,719
won out yeah and and i think it's you
 

4853
01:43:04,719 --> 01:43:06,310
won out yeah and and i think it's you
know and it worked out over time i mean

4854
01:43:06,310 --> 01:43:06,320
know and it worked out over time i mean
 

4855
01:43:06,320 --> 01:43:07,270
know and it worked out over time i mean
the

4856
01:43:07,270 --> 01:43:07,280
the
 

4857
01:43:07,280 --> 01:43:10,629
the
the biggest fights were with intel

4858
01:43:10,629 --> 01:43:10,639
the biggest fights were with intel
 

4859
01:43:10,639 --> 01:43:13,910
the biggest fights were with intel
because they had done some strange

4860
01:43:13,910 --> 01:43:13,920
because they had done some strange
 

4861
01:43:13,920 --> 01:43:15,270
because they had done some strange
things with rounding

4862
01:43:15,270 --> 01:43:15,280
things with rounding
 

4863
01:43:15,280 --> 01:43:16,790
things with rounding
they'd done some strange things with

4864
01:43:16,790 --> 01:43:16,800
they'd done some strange things with
 

4865
01:43:16,800 --> 01:43:19,350
they'd done some strange things with
their transcendental functions

4866
01:43:19,350 --> 01:43:19,360
their transcendental functions
 

4867
01:43:19,360 --> 01:43:22,070
their transcendental functions
which might turned into a mushroom cloud

4868
01:43:22,070 --> 01:43:22,080
which might turned into a mushroom cloud
 

4869
01:43:22,080 --> 01:43:23,270
which might turned into a mushroom cloud
of

4870
01:43:23,270 --> 01:43:23,280
of
 

4871
01:43:23,280 --> 01:43:26,070
of
you know weirdness and the name in the

4872
01:43:26,070 --> 01:43:26,080
you know weirdness and the name in the
 

4873
01:43:26,080 --> 01:43:27,350
you know weirdness and the name in the
name of optimization

4874
01:43:27,350 --> 01:43:27,360
name of optimization
 

4875
01:43:27,360 --> 01:43:29,189
name of optimization
but from the perspective of the

4876
01:43:29,189 --> 01:43:29,199
but from the perspective of the
 

4877
01:43:29,199 --> 01:43:30,390
but from the perspective of the
developer

4878
01:43:30,390 --> 01:43:30,400
developer
 

4879
01:43:30,400 --> 01:43:32,870
developer
that's not that's not good well their

4880
01:43:32,870 --> 01:43:32,880
that's not that's not good well their
 

4881
01:43:32,880 --> 01:43:34,390
that's not that's not good well their
issues with transcendental functions

4882
01:43:34,390 --> 01:43:34,400
issues with transcendental functions
 

4883
01:43:34,400 --> 01:43:35,669
issues with transcendental functions
were just stupid

4884
01:43:35,669 --> 01:43:35,679
were just stupid
 

4885
01:43:35,679 --> 01:43:38,790
were just stupid
okay so that that's that's not even a

4886
01:43:38,790 --> 01:43:38,800
okay so that that's that's not even a
 

4887
01:43:38,800 --> 01:43:40,629
okay so that that's that's not even a
trade-off that's just absolutely

4888
01:43:40,629 --> 01:43:40,639
trade-off that's just absolutely
 

4889
01:43:40,639 --> 01:43:42,229
trade-off that's just absolutely
yeah they were they were doing range

4890
01:43:42,229 --> 01:43:42,239
yeah they were they were doing range
 

4891
01:43:42,239 --> 01:43:45,510
yeah they were they were doing range

4895
01:43:48,480 --> 01:43:49,590
using a slightly wrong value for pi i
got it

4896
01:43:49,590 --> 01:43:49,600
got it
 

4897
01:43:49,600 --> 01:43:51,350
got it
go ahead ten minutes so in the interest

4898
01:43:51,350 --> 01:43:51,360
go ahead ten minutes so in the interest
 

4899
01:43:51,360 --> 01:43:52,709
go ahead ten minutes so in the interest
of time

4900
01:43:52,709 --> 01:43:52,719

two questions so one about android and

4902
01:43:54,550 --> 01:43:54,560
two questions so one about android and
 

4903
01:43:54,560 --> 01:43:56,709
two questions so one about android and
one about life

4904
01:43:56,709 --> 01:43:56,719
one about life
 

4905
01:43:56,719 --> 01:44:00,709
one about life
uh so one i mean we could talk for

4906
01:44:00,709 --> 01:44:00,719
uh so one i mean we could talk for
 

4907
01:44:00,719 --> 01:44:03,750
uh so one i mean we could talk for
many more hours i hope uh eventually we

4908
01:44:03,750 --> 01:44:03,760
many more hours i hope uh eventually we
 

4909
01:44:03,760 --> 01:44:04,950
many more hours i hope uh eventually we
might talk again

4910
01:44:04,950 --> 01:44:04,960
might talk again
 

4911
01:44:04,960 --> 01:44:07,590
might talk again
but i gotta ask you about android and

4912
01:44:07,590 --> 01:44:07,600
but i gotta ask you about android and
 

4913
01:44:07,600 --> 01:44:08,390
but i gotta ask you about android and
the use

4914
01:44:08,390 --> 01:44:08,400
the use
 

4915
01:44:08,400 --> 01:44:11,350
the use
of java there because it's one of the

4916
01:44:11,350 --> 01:44:11,360
of java there because it's one of the
 

4917
01:44:11,360 --> 01:44:13,830
of java there because it's one of the
many places where java

4918
01:44:13,830 --> 01:44:13,840
many places where java
 

4919
01:44:13,840 --> 01:44:16,310
many places where java

mushroomed into giant court cases
 

4971
01:45:14,880 --> 01:45:19,109
mushroomed into giant court cases
um and you know they didn't need to do

and in fact it would have been so much
cheaper for them to not cross lines

cheaper for them to not cross lines
 

4979
01:45:25,199 --> 01:45:28,229
cheaper for them to not cross lines
i mean i suppose they didn't anticipate

i mean i suppose they didn't anticipate
the the success uh

4982

or do you think at that time it was
already clear that this is uh it's gonna

4988
01:45:37,750 --> 01:45:37,760
already clear that this is uh it's gonna
 

4989
01:45:37,760 --> 01:45:38,870
already clear that this is uh it's gonna
blow up

4990
01:45:38,870 --> 01:45:38,880
blow up
 

4991

outside of that world for a decade so i
 

5059
01:46:57,920 --> 01:46:59,990
outside of that world for a decade so i
don't know how that has it has evolved
