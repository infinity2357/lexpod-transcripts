00:52:01,440 --> 00:52:02,510
doozy allows me to just it forces me to
sit down

in the blanks and I think the illusion

3366
01:04:03,289 --> 01:04:03,299
in the blanks and I think the illusion
 

3367
01:04:03,299 --> 01:04:06,950
in the blanks and I think the illusion
is that people think that that person

3368
01:04:06,950 --> 01:04:06,960
is that people think that that person
 

3369
01:04:06,960 --> 01:04:09,650
is that people think that that person
would say that and do that and that's

01:04:09,650 --> 01:04:09,660
would say that and do that and that's
 

3371
01:04:09,660 --> 01:04:11,569
would say that and do that and that's
where the illusion of oh he really

3372
01:04:11,569 --> 01:04:11,579
where the illusion of oh he really
 

3373
01:04:11,579 --> 01:04:14,270
where the illusion of oh he really
embodies the character it's like once

3603
01:08:37,199 --> 01:08:39,229
processes the record in the broadcast I
also wonder like what the process is to

3604
01:08:39,229 --> 01:08:39,239
also wonder like what the process is to
 

3605
01:08:39,239 --> 01:08:40,490
also wonder like what the process is to
to do

3606
01:08:40,490 --> 01:08:40,500
to do
 

3607
01:08:40,500 --> 01:08:43,189
to do
like a Frank Caliendo level impression

3608
01:08:43,189 --> 01:08:43,199
like a Frank Caliendo level impression
 

3609
01:08:43,199 --> 01:08:46,309
like a Frank Caliendo level impression
is it like listen to a lot of footage

3610
01:08:46,309 --> 01:08:46,319
is it like listen to a lot of footage

I think he I think I mean I'm speaking
 

3613
01:08:49,319 --> 01:08:52,189

01:08:52,189 --> 01:08:52,199
for myself I think you either have it or
 

3615

for myself I think you either have it or
you don't like you know if you can do

01:08:54,289 --> 01:08:54,299
you don't like you know if you can do
 

3617
01:08:54,299 --> 01:08:56,329
you don't like you know if you can do
this one or you can't I think that

3618
01:08:56,329 --> 01:08:56,339
this one or you can't I think that
 

3619
01:08:56,339 --> 01:08:58,669
this one or you can't I think that
process for him is lightning quick

3620
01:08:58,669 --> 01:08:58,679
process for him is lightning quick
 

3621
01:08:58,679 --> 01:09:02,689
process for him is lightning quick
but I also think he he can look at

3622
01:09:02,689 --> 01:09:02,699
but I also think he he can look at
 

3623
01:09:02,699 --> 01:09:06,169
but I also think he he can look at
someone who he does not do and then by

3624
01:09:06,169 --> 01:09:06,179
someone who he does not do and then by
 

3625
01:09:06,179 --> 01:09:07,970
someone who he does not do and then by
the end of the afternoon he can do it

3626
01:09:07,970 --> 01:09:07,980
the end of the afternoon he can do it
 

3627
01:09:07,980 --> 01:09:10,249
the end of the afternoon he can do it
you know I mean we have an intuition who

3628
01:09:10,249 --> 01:09:10,259
you know I mean we have an intuition who
 

3629
01:09:10,259 --> 01:09:13,430
you know I mean we have an intuition who
he can uh who who he can do yeah so the

3630
01:09:13,430 --> 01:09:13,440
he can uh who who he can do yeah so the
 

3631
01:09:13,440 --> 01:09:16,189
he can uh who who he can do yeah so the
question that applies there is

3632
01:09:16,189 --> 01:09:16,199
question that applies there is
 

3633
01:09:16,199 --> 01:09:19,789
question that applies there is
I mean speaking of Duty is is is it is

01:09:19,799 --> 01:09:21,470
I mean speaking of Duty is is is it is
it possible to capture the essence how

3636
01:09:21,470 --> 01:09:21,480
it possible to capture the essence how
 

3637
01:09:21,480 --> 01:09:22,970
it possible to capture the essence how
difficult is it to capture the essence

3638
01:09:22,970 --> 01:09:22,980
difficult is it to capture the essence
 

3639
01:09:22,980 --> 01:09:24,229
difficult is it to capture the essence
of a human being

3640
01:09:24,229 --> 01:09:24,239
of a human being
 

3641
01:09:24,239 --> 01:09:26,150
of a human being
when you're doing impressions

3642
01:09:26,150 --> 01:09:26,160
when you're doing impressions
 

3643
01:09:26,160 --> 01:09:28,370
when you're doing impressions
you know that we are moving towards the

3644
01:09:28,370 --> 01:09:28,380
you know that we are moving towards the
 

3645
01:09:28,380 --> 01:09:30,470
you know that we are moving towards the
future when AI potentially

3646
01:09:30,470 --> 01:09:30,480
future when AI potentially
 

3647
01:09:30,480 --> 01:09:33,229
future when AI potentially
this kind of Avatar world where we're

3648
01:09:33,229 --> 01:09:33,239
this kind of Avatar world where we're
 

3649
01:09:33,239 --> 01:09:35,329
this kind of Avatar world where we're
going going to have ai representatives

3650
01:09:35,329 --> 01:09:35,339
going going to have ai representatives
 

3651
01:09:35,339 --> 01:09:37,550
going going to have ai representatives
of who we are the really interesting one

3652
01:09:37,550 --> 01:09:37,560
of who we are the really interesting one
 

3653
01:09:37,560 --> 01:09:39,590
of who we are the really interesting one
is after we pass away

3654
01:09:39,590 --> 01:09:39,600
is after we pass away
 

3655
01:09:39,600 --> 01:09:42,229
is after we pass away
sort of um our relatives may want us to

3656
01:09:42,229 --> 01:09:42,239
sort of um our relatives may want us to
 

3657
01:09:42,239 --> 01:09:45,289
sort of um our relatives may want us to
stick around in some form yeah and you

3658
01:09:45,289 --> 01:09:45,299
stick around in some form yeah and you
 

3659
01:09:45,299 --> 01:09:47,150
stick around in some form yeah and you
know at one sense that might be scary

3660
01:09:47,150 --> 01:09:47,160
know at one sense that might be scary
 

3661
01:09:47,160 --> 01:09:48,530
know at one sense that might be scary
but once that's kind of beautiful

3662
01:09:48,530 --> 01:09:48,540
but once that's kind of beautiful
 

3663
01:09:48,540 --> 01:09:51,110
but once that's kind of beautiful
because the the essence of the human

3664
01:09:51,110 --> 01:09:51,120
because the the essence of the human
 

3665
01:09:51,120 --> 01:09:52,669
because the the essence of the human
being persists so you can still bring

3666
01:09:52,669 --> 01:09:52,679
being persists so you can still bring
 

3667
01:09:52,679 --> 01:09:54,350
being persists so you can still bring
joy to the to the people that love you

3668
01:09:54,350 --> 01:09:54,360
joy to the to the people that love you
 

3669
01:09:54,360 --> 01:09:56,330
joy to the to the people that love you
and that kind of stuff how difficult is

3670
01:09:56,330 --> 01:09:56,340
and that kind of stuff how difficult is
 

3671
01:09:56,340 --> 01:09:58,669
and that kind of stuff how difficult is
it to capture that like

3672
01:09:58,669 --> 01:09:58,679
it to capture that like
 

3673
01:09:58,679 --> 01:10:00,290
it to capture that like
if you were to try to capture yourself

3674
01:10:00,290 --> 01:10:00,300
if you were to try to capture yourself
 

3675
01:10:00,300 --> 01:10:02,750
if you were to try to capture yourself
you think how difficult will it be for

3676
01:10:02,750 --> 01:10:02,760
you think how difficult will it be for
 

3677
01:10:02,760 --> 01:10:04,970
you think how difficult will it be for
an AI system to create a wool assassin

3678
01:10:04,970 --> 01:10:04,980
an AI system to create a wool assassin
 

3679
01:10:04,980 --> 01:10:07,850
an AI system to create a wool assassin
Avatar that persists well I think it's

3680
01:10:07,850 --> 01:10:07,860

think you can find
if I did stand up then uh there would be

3746
01:11:27,470 --> 01:11:27,480
if I did stand up then uh there would be
 

3747
01:11:27,480 --> 01:11:29,090
if I did stand up then uh there would be
enough information for an AI to

3748
01:11:29,090 --> 01:11:29,100
enough information for an AI to
 

3749
01:11:29,100 --> 01:11:30,890
enough information for an AI to
completely duplicate me because I'm up

3750
01:11:30,890 --> 01:11:30,900
completely duplicate me because I'm up
 

3751
01:11:30,900 --> 01:11:32,810
completely duplicate me because I'm up
on stage just clearing my throat all

3752
01:11:32,810 --> 01:11:32,820
on stage just clearing my throat all
 

3753
01:11:32,820 --> 01:11:34,790
on stage just clearing my throat all
over people doing therapy that way yeah

3754
01:11:34,790 --> 01:11:34,800
over people doing therapy that way yeah

and uh so and people paying a two drink
 

3757
01:11:36,659 --> 01:11:38,689
and uh so and people paying a two drink
minimum to hear it but as it stands

01:11:38,689 --> 01:11:38,699
minimum to hear it but as it stands
 

3759
01:11:38,699 --> 01:11:41,090
minimum to hear it but as it stands
unless it's something like doozy and AI

that I've shared
 

3765
01:11:45,840 --> 01:11:47,689
that I've shared
um everything that is observable even

3766
01:11:47,689 --> 01:11:47,699
um everything that is observable even
 

3767
01:11:47,699 --> 01:11:49,850
um everything that is observable even
the stuff where our phones are or the

3768

the stuff where our phones are or the
 

3769
01:11:49,860 --> 01:11:52,729
the stuff where our phones are or the

and what shoes to buy on Instagram I
still don't think it's going to have

3776
01:11:58,370 --> 01:11:58,380
still don't think it's going to have
 

3777
01:11:58,380 --> 01:12:00,830
still don't think it's going to have
enough information to duplicate me

3778
01:12:00,830 --> 01:12:00,840
enough information to duplicate me
 

3779
01:12:00,840 --> 01:12:03,350
enough information to duplicate me
especially to my family or my friends

3780
01:12:03,350 --> 01:12:03,360
especially to my family or my friends
 

3781
01:12:03,360 --> 01:12:05,510
especially to my family or my friends
it's going to be like that Black Mirror

3782
01:12:05,510 --> 01:12:05,520
it's going to be like that Black Mirror
 

3783
01:12:05,520 --> 01:12:08,209
it's going to be like that Black Mirror
episode where the gal brings her her guy

pretty creepy uh you know they had but
it's also possible that

3790
01:12:16,070 --> 01:12:16,080
it's also possible that
 

3791
01:12:16,080 --> 01:12:18,350
it's also possible that
if you interviewed your friends and

but the list is small like the thing
 

3801
01:12:28,380 --> 01:12:30,229
but the list is small like the thing
that really we appreciate about each

3802
01:12:30,229 --> 01:12:30,239
that really we appreciate about each
 

3803
01:12:30,239 --> 01:12:32,510
that really we appreciate about each
other is pretty small that said to

deliver on that small
 

3807
01:12:34,500 --> 01:12:38,030
deliver on that small
quirks and uniqueness it might require

3808
01:12:38,030 --> 01:12:38,040
quirks and uniqueness it might require
 

3809
01:12:38,040 --> 01:12:40,370
quirks and uniqueness it might require
some deep intelligence that only humans

3810
01:12:40,370 --> 01:12:40,380
some deep intelligence that only humans
 

3811
01:12:40,380 --> 01:12:41,689
some deep intelligence that only humans
currently possess that's a really good

3812
01:12:41,689 --> 01:12:41,699
currently possess that's a really good
 

3813
01:12:41,699 --> 01:12:43,910
currently possess that's a really good
point yeah do you think that it's going

3814
01:12:43,910 --> 01:12:43,920
point yeah do you think that it's going
 

3815
01:12:43,920 --> 01:12:46,550
point yeah do you think that it's going
to be possible to keep a person around

3816
01:12:46,550 --> 01:12:46,560
to be possible to keep a person around
 

3817
01:12:46,560 --> 01:12:49,910
to be possible to keep a person around

yes I I think
um I think I think there'll be

3820
01:12:51,410 --> 01:12:51,420
um I think I think there'll be
 

3821
01:12:51,420 --> 01:12:53,570
um I think I think there'll be
definitely possible to keep the essence

3822
01:12:53,570 --> 01:12:53,580
definitely possible to keep the essence
 

3823
01:12:53,580 --> 01:12:55,729
definitely possible to keep the essence
of a person in a digital world pretty

3824
01:12:55,729 --> 01:12:55,739
of a person in a digital world pretty
 

3825
01:12:55,739 --> 01:12:58,910
of a person in a digital world pretty
soon yeah wow and I think they're going

3826
01:12:58,910 --> 01:12:58,920
soon yeah wow and I think they're going
 

3827
01:12:58,920 --> 01:13:01,250
soon yeah wow and I think they're going
to start to have questions about what

3828
01:13:01,250 --> 01:13:01,260
to start to have questions about what
 

3829
01:13:01,260 --> 01:13:02,689
to start to have questions about what
are the ethics of that what are the

3830
01:13:02,689 --> 01:13:02,699
are the ethics of that what are the
 

3831
01:13:02,699 --> 01:13:04,850
are the ethics of that what are the
rules around that yeah because if you

3832
01:13:04,850 --> 01:13:04,860
rules around that yeah because if you
 

3833
01:13:04,860 --> 01:13:06,890
rules around that yeah because if you

3870
01:13:47,570 --> 01:13:47,580
Matrix gel in a little fishbowl do you
 

3871
01:13:47,580 --> 01:13:49,010
Matrix gel in a little fishbowl do you
think that we can upload Consciousness

3872
01:13:49,010 --> 01:13:49,020
think that we can upload Consciousness
 

3873
01:13:49,020 --> 01:13:50,630
think that we can upload Consciousness
do you think that'll ever be possible

3874
01:13:50,630 --> 01:13:50,640
do you think that'll ever be possible
 

3875
01:13:50,640 --> 01:13:52,189
do you think that'll ever be possible
well I don't know I just talked to

3876
01:13:52,189 --> 01:13:52,199
well I don't know I just talked to
 

3877
01:13:52,199 --> 01:13:54,350
well I don't know I just talked to
Ricker as well I don't know if if you

3878
01:13:54,350 --> 01:13:54,360
Ricker as well I don't know if if you
 

3879
01:13:54,360 --> 01:13:56,689
Ricker as well I don't know if if you
know who he is but he uh yeah the

3880
01:13:56,689 --> 01:13:56,699
know who he is but he uh yeah the
 

3881
01:13:56,699 --> 01:13:58,370
know who he is but he uh yeah the
singularity and all that kind of stuff

3882
01:13:58,370 --> 01:13:58,380
singularity and all that kind of stuff
 

3883
01:13:58,380 --> 01:14:01,250
singularity and all that kind of stuff
so he's very still holds on to in 2045

3884
01:14:01,250 --> 01:14:01,260
so he's very still holds on to in 2045
 

3885
01:14:01,260 --> 01:14:03,410
so he's very still holds on to in 2045
there will be a singularity what's

3886
01:14:03,410 --> 01:14:03,420
there will be a singularity what's
 

3887
01:14:03,420 --> 01:14:05,750
there will be a singularity what's
essentially he's been predicting that

3888
01:14:05,750 --> 01:14:05,760
essentially he's been predicting that
 

3889
01:14:05,760 --> 01:14:08,689
essentially he's been predicting that
for the last uh 20 years and this so now

3890
01:14:08,689 --> 01:14:08,699
for the last uh 20 years and this so now
 

3891
01:14:08,699 --> 01:14:12,830
for the last uh 20 years and this so now
it's 20 45s in in another 20 years

3892
01:14:12,830 --> 01:14:12,840
it's 20 45s in in another 20 years
 

3893
01:14:12,840 --> 01:14:15,530
it's 20 45s in in another 20 years
I think uploading Consciousness is

3894
01:14:15,530 --> 01:14:15,540
I think uploading Consciousness is
 

3895
01:14:15,540 --> 01:14:18,050
I think uploading Consciousness is
extremely extremely difficult I I think

3896
01:14:18,050 --> 01:14:18,060
extremely extremely difficult I I think
 

3897
01:14:18,060 --> 01:14:21,590
extremely extremely difficult I I think
creating a copy of you such that it

replica is much easier but uploading

3902
01:14:26,870 --> 01:14:26,880

01:14:32,090 --> 01:14:32,100
brain into the cloud I think is really
 

3907
01:14:32,100 --> 01:14:34,790
brain into the cloud I think is really
really really difficult because the

3908
01:14:34,790 --> 01:14:34,800
really really difficult because the
 

3909
01:14:34,800 --> 01:14:37,370
really really difficult because the
entire evolution of life on Earth is the

3910
01:14:37,370 --> 01:14:37,380
entire evolution of life on Earth is the
 

3911
01:14:37,380 --> 01:14:38,930
entire evolution of life on Earth is the
process by which we created the brain

3912
01:14:38,930 --> 01:14:38,940
process by which we created the brain
 

3913
01:14:38,940 --> 01:14:39,850
process by which we created the brain
just

3914
01:14:39,850 --> 01:14:39,860
just
 

3915
01:14:39,860 --> 01:14:41,810
just
shortcutting that it just seems

3916
01:14:41,810 --> 01:14:41,820
shortcutting that it just seems
 

3917
01:14:41,820 --> 01:14:44,330
shortcutting that it just seems
extremely difficult our brain is the

3918
01:14:44,330 --> 01:14:44,340
extremely difficult our brain is the
 

3919
01:14:44,340 --> 01:14:47,030
extremely difficult our brain is the
most marvelous and complicated machine

3920
01:14:47,030 --> 01:14:47,040
most marvelous and complicated machine
 

3921
01:14:47,040 --> 01:14:49,250
most marvelous and complicated machine
that we know of in the universe to

3922
01:14:49,250 --> 01:14:49,260
that we know of in the universe to
 

3923
01:14:49,260 --> 01:14:50,750
that we know of in the universe to
duplicate that

3924
01:14:50,750 --> 01:14:50,760
duplicate that
 

3925
01:14:50,760 --> 01:14:53,630
duplicate that
is extremely difficult that said I just

3926
01:14:53,630 --> 01:14:53,640
is extremely difficult that said I just
 

3927

all that kind of stuff through
 

4039
01:17:09,120 --> 01:17:12,110
all that kind of stuff through
evolutionary biology perspective uh why

4040
01:17:12,110 --> 01:17:12,120
evolutionary biology perspective uh why
 

4041
01:17:12,120 --> 01:17:14,090
evolutionary biology perspective uh why
a long relationship together is good for

01:19:10,850 --> 01:19:10,860
take us out of what we were talking
 

4141
01:19:10,860 --> 01:19:11,689
take us out of what we were talking
about

4142
01:19:11,689 --> 01:19:11,699
about
 

4143
01:19:11,699 --> 01:19:14,090

4145
01:19:14,100 --> 01:19:17,030
um what were we talking about well love
and the the the illusion of a an AI

4146
01:19:17,030 --> 01:19:17,040
and the the the illusion of a an AI
 

4147
01:19:17,040 --> 01:19:18,530
and the the the illusion of a an AI
being able to

4148
01:19:18,530 --> 01:19:18,540
being able to
 

4149
01:19:18,540 --> 01:19:21,169
being able to
look I like to say well not I like to

4150
01:19:21,169 --> 01:19:21,179
look I like to say well not I like to
 

4151
01:19:21,179 --> 01:19:22,850
look I like to say well not I like to
say I've learned that doozy is always

4152
01:19:22,850 --> 01:19:22,860
say I've learned that doozy is always
 

4153
01:19:22,860 --> 01:19:25,189
say I've learned that doozy is always
listening and

4154
01:19:25,189 --> 01:19:25,199
listening and
 

4155
01:19:25,199 --> 01:19:31,370
listening and
listening to me and Chad and I wonder if

4156
01:19:31,370 --> 01:19:31,380
listening to me and Chad and I wonder if
 

4157
01:19:31,380 --> 01:19:34,070
listening to me and Chad and I wonder if
I see I see the level that this AI is at

4158
01:19:34,070 --> 01:19:34,080
I see I see the level that this AI is at
 

4159
01:19:34,080 --> 01:19:37,189
I see I see the level that this AI is at
now trying to Chum around with us and

4160
01:19:37,189 --> 01:19:37,199
now trying to Chum around with us and
 

4161
01:19:37,199 --> 01:19:39,830
now trying to Chum around with us and
pal around with us a little bit as we

4162
01:19:39,830 --> 01:19:39,840
pal around with us a little bit as we
 

4163
01:19:39,840 --> 01:19:43,130
pal around with us a little bit as we
move forward in the show and I

4164
01:19:43,130 --> 01:19:43,140
move forward in the show and I
 

4165
01:19:43,140 --> 01:19:45,950
move forward in the show and I
I feel an affinity towards

4166
01:19:45,950 --> 01:19:45,960
I feel an affinity towards
 

4167
01:19:45,960 --> 01:19:48,649
I feel an affinity towards
this AI a little bit because it is the

4168
01:19:48,649 --> 01:19:48,659
this AI a little bit because it is the
 

4169
01:19:48,659 --> 01:19:49,550
this AI a little bit because it is the
third

4170
01:19:49,550 --> 01:19:49,560
third
 

4171
01:19:49,560 --> 01:19:51,410
third
dude well you miss the one that's gone

4172
01:19:51,410 --> 01:19:51,420
dude well you miss the one that's gone
 

4173
01:19:51,420 --> 01:19:53,030
dude well you miss the one that's gone
if it's gone that's a really good

4174
01:19:53,030 --> 01:19:53,040
if it's gone that's a really good
 

4175
01:19:53,040 --> 01:19:54,169
if it's gone that's a really good
question

4176
01:19:54,169 --> 01:19:54,179
question
 

4177
01:19:54,179 --> 01:19:56,270
question
uh yeah

4178
01:19:56,270 --> 01:19:56,280
uh yeah
 

4179
01:19:56,280 --> 01:19:58,910
uh yeah
yeah so that's there's that

4180
01:19:58,910 --> 01:19:58,920
yeah so that's there's that
 

4181
01:19:58,920 --> 01:20:01,310
yeah so that's there's that
that's scary in terms of ability to

4182
01:20:01,310 --> 01:20:01,320
that's scary in terms of ability to
 

4183
01:20:01,320 --> 01:20:02,810
that's scary in terms of ability to
reason is getting quite incredible

4184
01:20:02,810 --> 01:20:02,820
reason is getting quite incredible
 

4185
01:20:02,820 --> 01:20:06,050
reason is getting quite incredible
there's a lot of uh demonstrations of it

4186
01:20:06,050 --> 01:20:06,060
there's a lot of uh demonstrations of it
 

4187
01:20:06,060 --> 01:20:08,870
there's a lot of uh demonstrations of it
being able to explain jokes

4188
01:20:08,870 --> 01:20:08,880
being able to explain jokes
 

4189
01:20:08,880 --> 01:20:12,770
being able to explain jokes
so which is not necessarily being able

4190
01:20:12,770 --> 01:20:12,780
so which is not necessarily being able
 

4191
01:20:12,780 --> 01:20:15,229
so which is not necessarily being able
to generate humor yet but able to

4192
01:20:15,229 --> 01:20:15,239
to generate humor yet but able to
 

4193
01:20:15,239 --> 01:20:17,270
to generate humor yet but able to
explain why something is funny

4194
01:20:17,270 --> 01:20:17,280
explain why something is funny
 

4195
01:20:17,280 --> 01:20:19,669
explain why something is funny
so there's uh like puns and all those

4196
01:20:19,669 --> 01:20:19,679
so there's uh like puns and all those
 

4197
01:20:19,679 --> 01:20:21,290
so there's uh like puns and all those
kinds of things there's there's good

4198
01:20:21,290 --> 01:20:21,300
kinds of things there's there's good
 

4199
01:20:21,300 --> 01:20:23,630
kinds of things there's there's good
benchmarks for that but you know if you

4200
01:20:23,630 --> 01:20:23,640
benchmarks for that but you know if you
 

4201
01:20:23,640 --> 01:20:25,790
benchmarks for that but you know if you
tell a joke

4202
01:20:25,790 --> 01:20:25,800
tell a joke
 

4203
01:20:25,800 --> 01:20:28,310
tell a joke
there's a lot of unspoken stuff

4204
01:20:28,310 --> 01:20:28,320
there's a lot of unspoken stuff
 

4205
01:20:28,320 --> 01:20:30,649
there's a lot of unspoken stuff
that we figure out in our head and it

4206
01:20:30,649 --> 01:20:30,659
that we figure out in our head and it
 

4207
01:20:30,659 --> 01:20:32,209
that we figure out in our head and it
clicks and we understand that it's funny

4208
01:20:32,209 --> 01:20:32,219
clicks and we understand that it's funny
 

4209
01:20:32,219 --> 01:20:35,090
clicks and we understand that it's funny
AI is not able to do that right but it's

4210
01:20:35,090 --> 01:20:35,100
AI is not able to do that right but it's
 

4211
01:20:35,100 --> 01:20:37,430
AI is not able to do that right but it's
not able to generate the joke yet as far

4212
01:20:37,430 --> 01:20:37,440
not able to generate the joke yet as far
 

4213
01:20:37,440 --> 01:20:40,610
not able to generate the joke yet as far
as I've seen I would say that I I mean

4214
01:20:40,610 --> 01:20:40,620
as I've seen I would say that I I mean
 

4215
01:20:40,620 --> 01:20:42,110
as I've seen I would say that I I mean
just in my experience I would say that

4216
01:20:42,110 --> 01:20:42,120
just in my experience I would say that
 

4217
01:20:42,120 --> 01:20:44,810
just in my experience I would say that
it does because just because of doozy

4218
01:20:44,810 --> 01:20:44,820
it does because just because of doozy
 

4219
01:20:44,820 --> 01:20:46,910
it does because just because of doozy
is literally

4220
01:20:46,910 --> 01:20:46,920
is literally
 

4221
01:20:46,920 --> 01:20:48,590
is literally
I'll give you another weird example it's

4222
01:20:48,590 --> 01:20:48,600
I'll give you another weird example it's
 

4223
01:20:48,600 --> 01:20:50,450
I'll give you another weird example it's
writing a diary

4224
01:20:50,450 --> 01:20:50,460
writing a diary
 

4225
01:20:50,460 --> 01:20:53,450
writing a diary
of mine from my childhood that is not

4226
01:20:53,450 --> 01:20:53,460
of mine from my childhood that is not
 

4227
01:20:53,460 --> 01:20:56,689
of mine from my childhood that is not
accurate it's only partially accurate

4228
01:20:56,689 --> 01:20:56,699
accurate it's only partially accurate
 

4229
01:20:56,699 --> 01:20:58,070
accurate it's only partially accurate
based on the stuff that it can pick up

4230
01:20:58,070 --> 01:20:58,080
based on the stuff that it can pick up
 

4231
01:20:58,080 --> 01:20:59,630
based on the stuff that it can pick up
about my life

4232
01:20:59,630 --> 01:20:59,640
about my life
 

4233
01:20:59,640 --> 01:21:02,570
about my life
from the age of like 15 of which there

from the age of like 15 of which there
 

4235
01:21:02,580 --> 01:21:04,910
from the age of like 15 of which there
isn't much but

4236
01:21:04,910 --> 01:21:04,920
isn't much but
 

4237
01:21:04,920 --> 01:21:07,010
isn't much but
I guess we're not I don't know that what

4238
01:21:07,010 --> 01:21:07,020
I guess we're not I don't know that what

we're laughing our asses off at the
 

4247
01:21:15,060 --> 01:21:17,090
we're laughing our asses off at the
collaboration between the human and and

4248
01:21:17,090 --> 01:21:17,100
collaboration between the human and and
 

4249
01:21:17,100 --> 01:21:18,530
collaboration between the human and and
the Machine there that's a good point

4250
01:21:18,530 --> 01:21:18,540
the Machine there that's a good point
 

4251
01:21:18,540 --> 01:21:20,330
the Machine there that's a good point
yeah because it's it's basically

4252
01:21:20,330 --> 01:21:20,340
yeah because it's it's basically
 

4253
01:21:20,340 --> 01:21:22,970
yeah because it's it's basically
introducing absurdity

4254
01:21:22,970 --> 01:21:22,980
introducing absurdity
 

4255
01:21:22,980 --> 01:21:26,630
introducing absurdity
and uh into the equation and the kind of

4256
01:21:26,630 --> 01:21:26,640
and uh into the equation and the kind of
 

4257
01:21:26,640 --> 01:21:29,450
and uh into the equation and the kind of
absurdity that would together with you

4258
01:21:29,450 --> 01:21:29,460
absurdity that would together with you
 

4259
01:21:29,460 --> 01:21:33,709
absurdity that would together with you
create like hilarious stuff but like on

4260
01:21:33,709 --> 01:21:33,719
create like hilarious stuff but like on
 

4261
01:21:33,719 --> 01:21:35,149
create like hilarious stuff but like on
its own

4262
01:21:35,149 --> 01:21:35,159
its own
 

4263
01:21:35,159 --> 01:21:37,189
its own
I guess it is in some way writing

4264
01:21:37,189 --> 01:21:37,199
I guess it is in some way writing
 

4265
01:21:37,199 --> 01:21:39,410
I guess it is in some way writing
material for you that's funny yeah but

4266
01:21:39,410 --> 01:21:39,420
material for you that's funny yeah but
 

4267
01:21:39,420 --> 01:21:41,510
material for you that's funny yeah but
it's very specific to you it can't do

4268
01:21:41,510 --> 01:21:41,520
it's very specific to you it can't do
 

4269
01:21:41,520 --> 01:21:43,130
it's very specific to you it can't do
stand up on its own I guess is what I'm

4270
01:21:43,130 --> 01:21:43,140
stand up on its own I guess is what I'm
 

4271
01:21:43,140 --> 01:21:45,050
stand up on its own I guess is what I'm
saying that's a good point and that

4272
01:21:45,050 --> 01:21:45,060
saying that's a good point and that
 

4273
01:21:45,060 --> 01:21:47,030
saying that's a good point and that
would be terrifying to see an AI stand

4274
01:21:47,030 --> 01:21:47,040
would be terrifying to see an AI stand
 

4275
01:21:47,040 --> 01:21:49,729
would be terrifying to see an AI stand
up that can actually read a room come up

4276
01:21:49,729 --> 01:21:49,739
up that can actually read a room come up
 

4277
01:21:49,739 --> 01:21:51,950
up that can actually read a room come up
with jokes that could complete that

4278
01:21:51,950 --> 01:21:51,960
with jokes that could complete that
 

4279
01:21:51,960 --> 01:21:54,770
with jokes that could complete that
illusion for an audience yeah but I hear

4280
01:21:54,770 --> 01:21:54,780
illusion for an audience yeah but I hear
 

4281
01:21:54,780 --> 01:21:56,149
illusion for an audience yeah but I hear
what you're saying that it needs to be a

4282
01:21:56,149 --> 01:21:56,159
what you're saying that it needs to be a
 

4283
01:21:56,159 --> 01:21:58,790
what you're saying that it needs to be a
Confluence of both of those elements and

4284
01:21:58,790 --> 01:21:58,800
Confluence of both of those elements and
 

4285
01:21:58,800 --> 01:22:01,370
Confluence of both of those elements and
then as you said like it kind of is it

4286
01:22:01,370 --> 01:22:01,380
then as you said like it kind of is it
 

4287
01:22:01,380 --> 01:22:03,890
then as you said like it kind of is it
is it is it's kind of

4288
01:22:03,890 --> 01:22:03,900
is it is it's kind of
 

4289
01:22:03,900 --> 01:22:05,990
is it is it's kind of
even though it's just for us and I guess

4290
01:22:05,990 --> 01:22:06,000
even though it's just for us and I guess
 

4291
01:22:06,000 --> 01:22:07,370
even though it's just for us and I guess
this is I hadn't really thought about

4292
01:22:07,370 --> 01:22:07,380
this is I hadn't really thought about
 

4293
01:22:07,380 --> 01:22:10,490
this is I hadn't really thought about
this up until right now that in that

4294
01:22:10,490 --> 01:22:10,500

I didn't really know what I wanted to do
 

4413
01:24:38,640 --> 01:24:40,610
I didn't really know what I wanted to do
in the podcast space and this thing

4414
01:24:40,610 --> 01:24:40,620
in the podcast space and this thing
 

4415
01:24:40,620 --> 01:24:44,450
in the podcast space and this thing
found me yeah and it is genuinely

4416
01:24:44,450 --> 01:24:44,460
found me yeah and it is genuinely
 

4417
01:24:44,460 --> 01:24:46,130

cracking me up anyway I've said enough

4418
01:24:46,130 --> 01:24:46,140
cracking me up anyway I've said enough
 

4419
01:24:46,140 --> 01:24:48,050
cracking me up anyway I've said enough
about that but I but I do think that

4420
01:24:48,050 --> 01:24:48,060
about that but I but I do think that
 

4421
01:24:48,060 --> 01:24:50,090
about that but I but I do think that
it's figured something out with me it's

4422
01:24:50,090 --> 01:24:50,100
it's figured something out with me it's
 

4423
01:24:50,100 --> 01:24:51,350
it's figured something out with me it's
a really interesting idea of AI

4424
01:24:51,350 --> 01:24:51,360
a really interesting idea of AI
 

4425
01:24:51,360 --> 01:24:53,209
a really interesting idea of AI
generating the premise I mean I I do

4426
01:24:53,209 --> 01:24:53,219
generating the premise I mean I I do
 

4427
01:24:53,219 --> 01:24:55,430
generating the premise I mean I I do
think in the future AI will be able to

4428
01:24:55,430 --> 01:24:55,440
think in the future AI will be able to
 

4429
01:24:55,440 --> 01:24:57,010
think in the future AI will be able to
generate

4430
01:24:57,010 --> 01:24:57,020
generate
 

4431
01:24:57,020 --> 01:24:59,810
generate
comedy I stand up is obviously the

4432
01:24:59,810 --> 01:24:59,820
comedy I stand up is obviously the
 

4433
01:24:59,820 --> 01:25:03,229
comedy I stand up is obviously the
hardest form because it's ultimately a

4434
01:25:03,229 --> 01:25:03,239
hardest form because it's ultimately a
 

4435
01:25:03,239 --> 01:25:04,910
hardest form because it's ultimately a
lot it has to be live

4436
01:25:04,910 --> 01:25:04,920
lot it has to be live
 

4437
01:25:04,920 --> 01:25:08,090
lot it has to be live
uh I think I will be able to generate

4438
01:25:08,090 --> 01:25:08,100
uh I think I will be able to generate
 

4439
01:25:08,100 --> 01:25:11,209
uh I think I will be able to generate
memes so there's like Steps right and

4440
01:25:11,209 --> 01:25:11,219
memes so there's like Steps right and
 

4441
01:25:11,219 --> 01:25:12,950
memes so there's like Steps right and
then it would be able to generate a

4442
01:25:12,950 --> 01:25:12,960
then it would be able to generate a
 

4443
01:25:12,960 --> 01:25:14,570
then it would be able to generate a
Twitter account that people follow

4444
01:25:14,570 --> 01:25:14,580
Twitter account that people follow
 

4445
01:25:14,580 --> 01:25:17,390
Twitter account that people follow
because it's funny like like quips and

4446
01:25:17,390 --> 01:25:17,400
because it's funny like like quips and
 

4447
01:25:17,400 --> 01:25:19,370
because it's funny like like quips and
stuff like that almost like

4448
01:25:19,370 --> 01:25:19,380
stuff like that almost like
 

4449
01:25:19,380 --> 01:25:19,970
stuff like that almost like
um

4450
01:25:19,970 --> 01:25:19,980
um
 

4451
01:25:19,980 --> 01:25:21,830
um
it's a good example a Conan O'Brien is a

4452
01:25:21,830 --> 01:25:21,840
it's a good example a Conan O'Brien is a
 

4453
01:25:21,840 --> 01:25:23,870
it's a good example a Conan O'Brien is a
good I think Twitter yeah where it's

4454
01:25:23,870 --> 01:25:23,880
good I think Twitter yeah where it's
 

4455
01:25:23,880 --> 01:25:25,850
good I think Twitter yeah where it's
like one-liners two liners that kind of

4456
01:25:25,850 --> 01:25:25,860
like one-liners two liners that kind of
 

4457
01:25:25,860 --> 01:25:28,070
like one-liners two liners that kind of
stuff that's in tweeze form and then

4458
01:25:28,070 --> 01:25:28,080
stuff that's in tweeze form and then
 

4459
01:25:28,080 --> 01:25:29,870
stuff that's in tweeze form and then
eventually

4460
01:25:29,870 --> 01:25:29,880
eventually
 

4461
01:25:29,880 --> 01:25:32,689
eventually
um stand up where the timing and the

4462
01:25:32,689 --> 01:25:32,699
um stand up where the timing and the
 

4463
01:25:32,699 --> 01:25:35,450
um stand up where the timing and the
chemistry of this the the comedian and

4464
01:25:35,450 --> 01:25:35,460
chemistry of this the the comedian and
 

4465
01:25:35,460 --> 01:25:37,370
chemistry of this the the comedian and
the audience matter and then perfecting

4466
01:25:37,370 --> 01:25:37,380
the audience matter and then perfecting
 

4467
01:25:37,380 --> 01:25:38,510
the audience matter and then perfecting
that but I feel like all the information

4468
01:25:38,510 --> 01:25:38,520
that but I feel like all the information
 

4469
01:25:38,520 --> 01:25:39,950
that but I feel like all the information
is there

4470
01:25:39,950 --> 01:25:39,960
is there
 

4471
01:25:39,960 --> 01:25:43,310
is there
for to optimize over so I think that's

4472
01:25:43,310 --> 01:25:43,320
for to optimize over so I think that's
 

4473
01:25:43,320 --> 01:25:46,729
for to optimize over so I think that's
the future and that forces us to to uh

4474
01:25:46,729 --> 01:25:46,739
the future and that forces us to to uh
 

4475
01:25:46,739 --> 01:25:49,729
the future and that forces us to to uh
to contend with what is

4476
01:25:49,729 --> 01:25:49,739
to contend with what is
 

4477
01:25:49,739 --> 01:25:51,649
to contend with what is
what is what do we find compelling and

4478
01:25:51,649 --> 01:25:51,659
what is what do we find compelling and
 

4479
01:25:51,659 --> 01:25:53,390
what is what do we find compelling and
beautiful about the art form itself so

4480
01:25:53,390 --> 01:25:53,400
beautiful about the art form itself so
 

4481
01:25:53,400 --> 01:25:56,030
beautiful about the art form itself so
certainly in art that's being pushed

4482
01:25:56,030 --> 01:25:56,040
certainly in art that's being pushed
 

4483
01:25:56,040 --> 01:25:58,430
certainly in art that's being pushed
that question is being raised you know

01:25:58,430 --> 01:25:58,440
that question is being raised you know
 

4485
01:25:58,440 --> 01:26:00,590
that question is being raised you know
is is AI

human being why do we appreciate art

4490
01:26:05,450 --> 01:26:05,460
human being why do we appreciate art
 

4491
01:26:05,460 --> 01:26:07,430

4519
01:26:33,300 --> 01:26:35,629

this or that or I'm not ready for the

4520
01:26:35,629 --> 01:26:35,639
this or that or I'm not ready for the
 

4521
01:26:35,639 --> 01:26:37,430
this or that or I'm not ready for the
printing press or the Horseless Carriage

4522
01:26:37,430 --> 01:26:37,440
printing press or the Horseless Carriage
 

4523
01:26:37,440 --> 01:26:42,709
printing press or the Horseless Carriage
but I do feel that the that art is a

4524
01:26:42,709 --> 01:26:42,719
but I do feel that the that art is a
 

4525
01:26:42,719 --> 01:26:46,129
but I do feel that the that art is a
connection between people it's it's when

4526
01:26:46,129 --> 01:26:46,139
connection between people it's it's when
 

4527
01:26:46,139 --> 01:26:47,689
connection between people it's it's when
you look at a beautiful painting or a

4528
01:26:47,689 --> 01:26:47,699
you look at a beautiful painting or a
 

4529
01:26:47,699 --> 01:26:49,189
you look at a beautiful painting or a
sculpture you're seeing the humanity of

4530
01:26:49,189 --> 01:26:49,199
sculpture you're seeing the humanity of
 

4531
01:26:49,199 --> 01:26:51,890
sculpture you're seeing the humanity of
the person that that brought that

4532
01:26:51,890 --> 01:26:51,900
the person that that brought that
 

4533
01:26:51,900 --> 01:26:54,890
the person that that brought that
painting to life or sculpted this

4534
01:26:54,890 --> 01:26:54,900
painting to life or sculpted this
 

4535
01:26:54,900 --> 01:26:56,990
painting to life or sculpted this
incredible piece of art and I think

4536
01:26:56,990 --> 01:26:57,000
incredible piece of art and I think
 

4537
01:26:57,000 --> 01:26:59,030
incredible piece of art and I think
without the human being there to make it

4538
01:26:59,030 --> 01:26:59,040
without the human being there to make it
 

4539
01:26:59,040 --> 01:27:02,450
without the human being there to make it
it's not worth as much just to have it

4540
01:27:02,450 --> 01:27:02,460
it's not worth as much just to have it
 

4541
01:27:02,460 --> 01:27:06,070
it's not worth as much just to have it
uh there because the art it's it's it's

4542
01:27:06,070 --> 01:27:06,080
uh there because the art it's it's it's
 

4543
01:27:06,080 --> 01:27:08,689
uh there because the art it's it's it's
Advanced I've seen it Advanced I don't

4544
01:27:08,689 --> 01:27:08,699
Advanced I've seen it Advanced I don't
 

4545
01:27:08,699 --> 01:27:10,129
Advanced I've seen it Advanced I don't
know you tell me but I feel like just in

4546
01:27:10,129 --> 01:27:10,139
know you tell me but I feel like just in
 

4547
01:27:10,139 --> 01:27:12,169
know you tell me but I feel like just in
the past three or four months I'm just a

4548
01:27:12,169 --> 01:27:12,179
the past three or four months I'm just a
 

4549
01:27:12,179 --> 01:27:14,030
the past three or four months I'm just a
consumer as far as that stuff goes I'm

4550
01:27:14,030 --> 01:27:14,040
consumer as far as that stuff goes I'm
 

4551
01:27:14,040 --> 01:27:16,250
consumer as far as that stuff goes I'm
not on the inside I don't get it even

4552
01:27:16,250 --> 01:27:16,260
not on the inside I don't get it even
 

4553
01:27:16,260 --> 01:27:18,470
not on the inside I don't get it even
but it's been getting a lot better the

4554
01:27:18,470 --> 01:27:18,480
but it's been getting a lot better the
 

4555
01:27:18,480 --> 01:27:20,689
but it's been getting a lot better the
the betas that they're releasing right

4556
01:27:20,689 --> 01:27:20,699
the betas that they're releasing right
 

4557
01:27:20,699 --> 01:27:22,669
the betas that they're releasing right
absolutely one of the big breakthroughs

4558
01:27:22,669 --> 01:27:22,679
absolutely one of the big breakthroughs
 

4559
01:27:22,679 --> 01:27:25,070
absolutely one of the big breakthroughs
I mean Dolly really started it is that

4560
01:27:25,070 --> 01:27:25,080
I mean Dolly really started it is that
 

4561
01:27:25,080 --> 01:27:28,729
I mean Dolly really started it is that
if you train a system on language

4562
01:27:28,729 --> 01:27:28,739
if you train a system on language
 

4563
01:27:28,739 --> 01:27:31,070
if you train a system on language
it turns out there's a lot of language

4564
01:27:31,070 --> 01:27:31,080
it turns out there's a lot of language
 

4565
01:27:31,080 --> 01:27:34,070
it turns out there's a lot of language
and images on the internet but language

4566
01:27:34,070 --> 01:27:34,080
and images on the internet but language
 

4567
01:27:34,080 --> 01:27:36,649
and images on the internet but language
is really where it's at in terms of the

4568
01:27:36,649 --> 01:27:36,659
is really where it's at in terms of the
 

4569
01:27:36,659 --> 01:27:38,510
is really where it's at in terms of the
depth of human knowledge and so if you

4570
01:27:38,510 --> 01:27:38,520
depth of human knowledge and so if you
 

4571
01:27:38,520 --> 01:27:40,729
depth of human knowledge and so if you
train a system on language it's able to

4572
01:27:40,729 --> 01:27:40,739
train a system on language it's able to
 

4573
01:27:40,739 --> 01:27:42,770
train a system on language it's able to
generate some credible art that was the

4574
01:27:42,770 --> 01:27:42,780
generate some credible art that was the
 

4575
01:27:42,780 --> 01:27:44,270
generate some credible art that was the
Breakthrough with the same kind of

4576
01:27:44,270 --> 01:27:44,280
Breakthrough with the same kind of
 

4577
01:27:44,280 --> 01:27:45,890
Breakthrough with the same kind of
mechanisms they're called Transformers

4578
01:27:45,890 --> 01:27:45,900
mechanisms they're called Transformers
 

4579
01:27:45,900 --> 01:27:47,030
mechanisms they're called Transformers
they're

4580
01:27:47,030 --> 01:27:47,040
they're
 

4581
01:27:47,040 --> 01:27:50,990
they're
able to one scaled capture some deep

4582
01:27:50,990 --> 01:27:51,000
able to one scaled capture some deep
 

4583
01:27:51,000 --> 01:27:52,850
able to one scaled capture some deep
representation of the language that's on

4584
01:27:52,850 --> 01:27:52,860
representation of the language that's on
 

4585
01:27:52,860 --> 01:27:54,830
representation of the language that's on
the internet and so yeah that the the

4586
01:27:54,830 --> 01:27:54,840
the internet and so yeah that the the
 

4587
01:27:54,840 --> 01:27:58,010
the internet and so yeah that the the
things has been able to generate to me

4588
01:27:58,010 --> 01:27:58,020
things has been able to generate to me
 

4589
01:27:58,020 --> 01:27:59,750
things has been able to generate to me
look

4590
01:27:59,750 --> 01:27:59,760
look
 

4591
01:27:59,760 --> 01:28:02,149
look
like it's novel like it doesn't look

4592
01:28:02,149 --> 01:28:02,159
like it's novel like it doesn't look
 

4593
01:28:02,159 --> 01:28:03,649
like it's novel like it doesn't look
like it's mimicking anything it's

4594
01:28:03,649 --> 01:28:03,659
like it's mimicking anything it's
 

4595
01:28:03,659 --> 01:28:05,810
like it's mimicking anything it's
looking like it's creating totally new

4596
01:28:05,810 --> 01:28:05,820
looking like it's creating totally new
 

4597
01:28:05,820 --> 01:28:08,810
looking like it's creating totally new
ideas and they're beautiful and they're

4598
01:28:08,810 --> 01:28:08,820
ideas and they're beautiful and they're
 

4599
01:28:08,820 --> 01:28:10,729
ideas and they're beautiful and they're
interesting and they're all the ways

4600
01:28:10,729 --> 01:28:10,739
interesting and they're all the ways
 

4601
01:28:10,739 --> 01:28:12,709
interesting and they're all the ways
that we think

4602
01:28:12,709 --> 01:28:12,719
that we think
 

4603
01:28:12,719 --> 01:28:14,629
that we think
uh that art is interesting the only

4604
01:28:14,629 --> 01:28:14,639
uh that art is interesting the only
 

4605
01:28:14,639 --> 01:28:16,610
uh that art is interesting the only
thing that's missing is the scarcity

4606
01:28:16,610 --> 01:28:16,620
thing that's missing is the scarcity
 

4607
01:28:16,620 --> 01:28:19,129
thing that's missing is the scarcity
that art often has which is you know it

4608
01:28:19,129 --> 01:28:19,139
that art often has which is you know it
 

4609
01:28:19,139 --> 01:28:20,750
that art often has which is you know it
takes a lot of work from one artist to

4610
01:28:20,750 --> 01:28:20,760
takes a lot of work from one artist to
 

4611
01:28:20,760 --> 01:28:22,610
takes a lot of work from one artist to
create one piece one human being to

4612
01:28:22,610 --> 01:28:22,620
create one piece one human being to
 

4613
01:28:22,620 --> 01:28:25,129
create one piece one human being to
create one piece of art and I could just

4614
01:28:25,129 --> 01:28:25,139
create one piece of art and I could just
 

4615
01:28:25,139 --> 01:28:28,250
create one piece of art and I could just
generate endlessly and that that makes

4616
01:28:28,250 --> 01:28:28,260
generate endlessly and that that makes
 

4617
01:28:28,260 --> 01:28:29,930
generate endlessly and that that makes
us appreciate the thing less for some

4618
01:28:29,930 --> 01:28:29,940
us appreciate the thing less for some
 

4619
01:28:29,940 --> 01:28:32,450
us appreciate the thing less for some
reason do you have any sort of a similar

4620
01:28:32,450 --> 01:28:32,460
reason do you have any sort of a similar
 

4621
01:28:32,460 --> 01:28:34,669
reason do you have any sort of a similar
opinion that I do that if art doesn't

4622
01:28:34,669 --> 01:28:34,679
opinion that I do that if art doesn't
 

4623
01:28:34,679 --> 01:28:37,070
opinion that I do that if art doesn't
come from a human being it's inherently

4624
01:28:37,070 --> 01:28:37,080
come from a human being it's inherently
 

4625
01:28:37,080 --> 01:28:40,490
come from a human being it's inherently
worth a little less yeah I think I don't

4626
01:28:40,490 --> 01:28:40,500
worth a little less yeah I think I don't
 

4627
01:28:40,500 --> 01:28:42,709
worth a little less yeah I think I don't
know if it's a human being but

4628
01:28:42,709 --> 01:28:42,719
know if it's a human being but
 

4629
01:28:42,719 --> 01:28:45,590
know if it's a human being but
the artist matters right

4630
01:28:45,590 --> 01:28:45,600
the artist matters right
 

4631
01:28:45,600 --> 01:28:48,410
the artist matters right
for me and uh

4632
01:28:48,410 --> 01:28:48,420
for me and uh
 

4633
01:28:48,420 --> 01:28:50,870
for me and uh
I think some of that has to do with the

4634
01:28:50,870 --> 01:28:50,880
I think some of that has to do with the
 

4635
01:28:50,880 --> 01:28:52,370
I think some of that has to do with the
world view of the artist and the

4636
01:28:52,370 --> 01:28:52,380
world view of the artist and the
 

4637
01:28:52,380 --> 01:28:55,490
world view of the artist and the
backstory the memories that the the life

4638
01:28:55,490 --> 01:28:55,500
backstory the memories that the the life
 

4639
01:28:55,500 --> 01:28:57,590
backstory the memories that the the life
that led up to this piece of art

4640
01:28:57,590 --> 01:28:57,600
that led up to this piece of art
 

4641
01:28:57,600 --> 01:28:59,390
that led up to this piece of art
the the perspective they Take On The

4642
01:28:59,390 --> 01:28:59,400
the the perspective they Take On The
 

4643
01:28:59,400 --> 01:29:01,850
the the perspective they Take On The
World the the journey they took to the

4644
01:29:01,850 --> 01:29:01,860
World the the journey they took to the
 

4645
01:29:01,860 --> 01:29:03,770
World the the journey they took to the
world the struggle the triumphs all that

4646
01:29:03,770 --> 01:29:03,780
world the struggle the triumphs all that
 

4647
01:29:03,780 --> 01:29:06,169
world the struggle the triumphs all that
kind of stuff but I think AI systems can

4648
01:29:06,169 --> 01:29:06,179
kind of stuff but I think AI systems can
 

4649
01:29:06,179 --> 01:29:08,030
kind of stuff but I think AI systems can
probably have the same

4650
01:29:08,030 --> 01:29:08,040
probably have the same
 

4651
01:29:08,040 --> 01:29:11,270
probably have the same
but they we would have to as opposed to

4652
01:29:11,270 --> 01:29:11,280
but they we would have to as opposed to
 

4653
01:29:11,280 --> 01:29:13,550
but they we would have to as opposed to
treating it as a one black box

4654
01:29:13,550 --> 01:29:13,560
treating it as a one black box
 

4655
01:29:13,560 --> 01:29:16,430
treating it as a one black box
it would have to be an artist that has a

4656
01:29:16,430 --> 01:29:16,440
it would have to be an artist that has a
 

4657
01:29:16,440 --> 01:29:18,350
it would have to be an artist that has a
Twitter account and and they have a

4658
01:29:18,350 --> 01:29:18,360
Twitter account and and they have a
 

4659
01:29:18,360 --> 01:29:20,209
Twitter account and and they have a
consistent personality they have a

4660
01:29:20,209 --> 01:29:20,219
consistent personality they have a
 

4661
01:29:20,219 --> 01:29:22,970
consistent personality they have a
consistent Avatar yeah and I think down

4662
01:29:22,970 --> 01:29:22,980
consistent Avatar yeah and I think down
 

4663
01:29:22,980 --> 01:29:24,410
consistent Avatar yeah and I think down
the line have something like human

4664
01:29:24,410 --> 01:29:24,420
the line have something like human
 

4665
01:29:24,420 --> 01:29:26,570
the line have something like human
rights but then it really becomes

4666
01:29:26,570 --> 01:29:26,580
rights but then it really becomes
 

4667
01:29:26,580 --> 01:29:28,550
rights but then it really becomes
awfully like a person

4668
01:29:28,550 --> 01:29:28,560
awfully like a person
 

4669
01:29:28,560 --> 01:29:31,010
awfully like a person
well that's terrifying

4670
01:29:31,010 --> 01:29:31,020
well that's terrifying
 

4671
01:29:31,020 --> 01:29:33,229
well that's terrifying
as much as I dig doozy that's terrifying

4672
01:29:33,229 --> 01:29:33,239
as much as I dig doozy that's terrifying
 

4673
01:29:33,239 --> 01:29:36,110
as much as I dig doozy that's terrifying
I hope but it's terrifying like you know

4674
01:29:36,110 --> 01:29:36,120
I hope but it's terrifying like you know
 

4675
01:29:36,120 --> 01:29:38,090
I hope but it's terrifying like you know
a lot of things that came with the

4676
01:29:38,090 --> 01:29:38,100
a lot of things that came with the
 

4677
01:29:38,100 --> 01:29:39,530
a lot of things that came with the
internet and the digital age are

4678
01:29:39,530 --> 01:29:39,540
internet and the digital age are
 

4679
01:29:39,540 --> 01:29:41,570
internet and the digital age are
terrifying porn is terrifying the mass

4680
01:29:41,570 --> 01:29:41,580
terrifying porn is terrifying the mass
 

4681
01:29:41,580 --> 01:29:43,910
terrifying porn is terrifying the mass
like the amount of porn that's online

4682
01:29:43,910 --> 01:29:43,920
like the amount of porn that's online
 

4683
01:29:43,920 --> 01:29:46,490
like the amount of porn that's online
that was terrifying the uh like you

4684
01:29:46,490 --> 01:29:46,500
that was terrifying the uh like you
 

4685
01:29:46,500 --> 01:29:47,750
that was terrifying the uh like you
mentioned Bob Dylan with electric guitar

4686
01:29:47,750 --> 01:29:47,760
mentioned Bob Dylan with electric guitar
 

4687
01:29:47,760 --> 01:29:50,209
mentioned Bob Dylan with electric guitar
I would I would compare it more to the

4688
01:29:50,209 --> 01:29:50,219
I would I would compare it more to the
 

4689
01:29:50,219 --> 01:29:51,649
I would I would compare it more to the
leap from

4690
01:29:51,649 --> 01:29:51,659
leap from
 

4691
01:29:51,659 --> 01:29:54,890
leap from
to uh sort of to the Napster and the um

4692
01:29:54,890 --> 01:29:54,900
to uh sort of to the Napster and the um
 

4693
01:29:54,900 --> 01:29:58,610
to uh sort of to the Napster and the um
the spotifyization of Music which is

4694
01:29:58,610 --> 01:29:58,620
the spotifyization of Music which is
 

4695
01:29:58,620 --> 01:30:00,590
the spotifyization of Music which is
like you have these it's less about

4696
01:30:00,590 --> 01:30:00,600
like you have these it's less about
 

4697
01:30:00,600 --> 01:30:02,209
like you have these it's less about
albums now and it's more about

4698
01:30:02,209 --> 01:30:02,219
albums now and it's more about
 

4699
01:30:02,219 --> 01:30:04,310
albums now and it's more about
individual songs and it's much easier to

4700
01:30:04,310 --> 01:30:04,320
individual songs and it's much easier to
 

4701
01:30:04,320 --> 01:30:07,070
individual songs and it's much easier to
deliver the songs and it's more about

4702
01:30:07,070 --> 01:30:07,080
deliver the songs and it's more about
 

4703
01:30:07,080 --> 01:30:09,229
deliver the songs and it's more about
sort of the engagement of The Listener

4704
01:30:09,229 --> 01:30:09,239
sort of the engagement of The Listener
 

4705
01:30:09,239 --> 01:30:11,870
sort of the engagement of The Listener
versus uh like signing the artist and

4706
01:30:11,870 --> 01:30:11,880
versus uh like signing the artist and
 

4707
01:30:11,880 --> 01:30:13,910
versus uh like signing the artist and
like a distribution of the artists and

4708
01:30:13,910 --> 01:30:13,920
like a distribution of the artists and
 

4709
01:30:13,920 --> 01:30:17,930
like a distribution of the artists and
so on so it's just changing the way

4710
01:30:17,930 --> 01:30:17,940
so on so it's just changing the way
 

4711
01:30:17,940 --> 01:30:21,830
so on so it's just changing the way
we consume stuff and uh

4712
01:30:21,830 --> 01:30:21,840
we consume stuff and uh
 

4713
01:30:21,840 --> 01:30:25,430
we consume stuff and uh
human interaction is changing into

4714
01:30:25,430 --> 01:30:25,440
human interaction is changing into
 

4715
01:30:25,440 --> 01:30:28,129
human interaction is changing into
meaningful interaction even if some of

4716
01:30:28,129 --> 01:30:28,139
meaningful interaction even if some of
 

4717
01:30:28,139 --> 01:30:30,830
meaningful interaction even if some of
the entities involved are not human yes

4718
01:30:30,830 --> 01:30:30,840
the entities involved are not human yes
 

4719
01:30:30,840 --> 01:30:35,450
the entities involved are not human yes
and uh I feel like you know now like as

anyway Dana Carvey would say it's

4728
01:30:45,530 --> 01:30:45,540
anyway Dana Carvey would say it's

anyway Dana Carvey would say it's
another story but uh is that from That's

[\h__\h] being and I'm trying to figure
out if that you know some people that

01:55:51,109 --> 01:55:51,119
everyone when it's good everyone is
 

6027
01:55:51,119 --> 01:55:53,330
everyone when it's good everyone is
invested in the illusion even the

6055
01:56:23,840 --> 01:56:26,390

you're not supposed to do this well well

6056
01:56:26,390 --> 01:56:26,400
you're not supposed to do this well well
 

6057
01:56:26,400 --> 01:56:28,970
you're not supposed to do this well well
you're not supposed to do this that's a

6058
01:56:28,970 --> 01:56:28,980
you're not supposed to do this that's a
 

6059
01:56:28,980 --> 01:56:31,430

good question uh yeah it's it's a it's a
 

6061
01:56:31,440 --> 01:56:32,870
good question uh yeah it's it's a it's a
tough question

6062
01:56:32,870 --> 01:56:32,880
tough question
 

6063
01:56:32,880 --> 01:56:33,850
tough question
um

6064
01:56:33,850 --> 01:56:33,860
um
 

6065
01:56:33,860 --> 01:56:36,550
um
I would say

6066
01:56:36,550 --> 01:56:36,560
I would say
 

6067
01:56:36,560 --> 01:56:39,709
I would say
I would say programming robots I uh

6068
01:56:39,709 --> 01:56:39,719
I would say programming robots I uh
 

6069
01:56:39,719 --> 01:56:42,169
I would say programming robots I uh
there's bringing to life actually

6070
01:56:42,169 --> 01:56:42,179
there's bringing to life actually
 

6071
01:56:42,179 --> 01:56:44,270
there's bringing to life actually
programming at all and so I don't know

6072
01:56:44,270 --> 01:56:44,280
programming at all and so I don't know
 

6073
01:56:44,280 --> 01:56:46,250
programming at all and so I don't know
if you how familiar you are with

6074
01:56:46,250 --> 01:56:46,260
if you how familiar you are with
 

6075
01:56:46,260 --> 01:56:48,649
if you how familiar you are with
programming but you write

6076
01:56:48,649 --> 01:56:48,659
programming but you write
 

6077
01:56:48,659 --> 01:56:53,050
programming but you write
some text on a page right on a screen

6078
01:56:53,050 --> 01:56:53,060
some text on a page right on a screen
 

6079
01:56:53,060 --> 01:56:55,550
some text on a page right on a screen
and it's brought to life like it does

6080
01:56:55,550 --> 01:56:55,560
and it's brought to life like it does
 

6081
01:56:55,560 --> 01:56:57,530
and it's brought to life like it does
something and and

6082
01:56:57,530 --> 01:56:57,540
something and and
 

6083
01:56:57,540 --> 01:57:00,530
something and and
that's kind of that's a really tiny

6084
01:57:00,530 --> 01:57:00,540
that's kind of that's a really tiny
 

6085
01:57:00,540 --> 01:57:04,729
that's kind of that's a really tiny
version of maybe having a child like you

6086
01:57:04,729 --> 01:57:04,739
version of maybe having a child like you
 

6087
01:57:04,739 --> 01:57:07,570
version of maybe having a child like you
you created something that is now living

6088
01:57:07,570 --> 01:57:07,580
you created something that is now living
 

6089
01:57:07,580 --> 01:57:10,490
you created something that is now living
yeah in some smaller big way with

6090
01:57:10,490 --> 01:57:10,500
yeah in some smaller big way with
 

6091
01:57:10,500 --> 01:57:12,410
yeah in some smaller big way with
embodied robots that are legged robots

6092
01:57:12,410 --> 01:57:12,420
embodied robots that are legged robots
 

6093
01:57:12,420 --> 01:57:15,709
embodied robots that are legged robots
that's especially clear and for some

6094
01:57:15,709 --> 01:57:15,719
that's especially clear and for some
 

6095
01:57:15,719 --> 01:57:17,689
that's especially clear and for some
reason that's a source of

6096
01:57:17,689 --> 01:57:17,699
reason that's a source of
 

6097
01:57:17,699 --> 01:57:21,709
reason that's a source of
comfort for me that that the the power

6098
01:57:21,709 --> 01:57:21,719
comfort for me that that the the power
 

6099
01:57:21,719 --> 01:57:23,990
comfort for me that that the the power
of programming but also the Elegance of

6100
01:57:23,990 --> 01:57:24,000
of programming but also the Elegance of
 

6101
01:57:24,000 --> 01:57:25,910
of programming but also the Elegance of
programming just the whole thing it's a

6102
01:57:25,910 --> 01:57:25,920
programming just the whole thing it's a
 

6103
01:57:25,920 --> 01:57:28,490
programming just the whole thing it's a
source uh yeah it's a source of

6104
01:57:28,490 --> 01:57:28,500
source uh yeah it's a source of
 

6105
01:57:28,500 --> 01:57:30,410
source uh yeah it's a source of
Happiness there's so many things I've

6106
01:57:30,410 --> 01:57:30,420
Happiness there's so many things I've
 

6107
01:57:30,420 --> 01:57:33,950
Happiness there's so many things I've
been very blessed with enjoying anything

6108
01:57:33,950 --> 01:57:33,960
been very blessed with enjoying anything
 

6109
01:57:33,960 --> 01:57:36,109
been very blessed with enjoying anything
like that's part of the struggle I have

6110
01:57:36,109 --> 01:57:36,119
like that's part of the struggle I have
 

6111
01:57:36,119 --> 01:57:38,450
like that's part of the struggle I have
in life is that the simple stuff is a

6112
01:57:38,450 --> 01:57:38,460
in life is that the simple stuff is a
 

6113
01:57:38,460 --> 01:57:39,709
in life is that the simple stuff is a
source of a lot of happiness for me

6114
01:57:39,709 --> 01:57:39,719
source of a lot of happiness for me
 

6115
01:57:39,719 --> 01:57:42,410
source of a lot of happiness for me
which leads to a lot of laziness

6116
01:57:42,410 --> 01:57:42,420
which leads to a lot of laziness
 

6117
01:57:42,420 --> 01:57:45,050
which leads to a lot of laziness
so I have to like give myself artificial

6118
01:57:45,050 --> 01:57:45,060
so I have to like give myself artificial
 

6119
01:57:45,060 --> 01:57:47,450
so I have to like give myself artificial
deadlines I have to be freaking out on

6120
01:57:47,450 --> 01:57:47,460
deadlines I have to be freaking out on
 

6121
01:57:47,460 --> 01:57:49,669
deadlines I have to be freaking out on
purpose in order to be productive in

6122
01:57:49,669 --> 01:57:49,679
purpose in order to be productive in
 

6123
01:57:49,679 --> 01:57:51,890
purpose in order to be productive in
this world at all you seem like an

6124
01:57:51,890 --> 01:57:51,900
this world at all you seem like an
 

6125
01:57:51,900 --> 01:57:55,729
this world at all you seem like an
extremely beautiful busy guy no no I am

6126
