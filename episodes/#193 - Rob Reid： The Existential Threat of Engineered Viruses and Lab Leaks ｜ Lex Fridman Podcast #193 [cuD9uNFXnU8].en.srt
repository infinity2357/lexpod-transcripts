00:02:42,879 --> 00:02:44,309
the most entertaining outcome is the
most likely

174
00:02:44,309 --> 00:02:44,319
most likely
 

175
00:02:44,319 --> 00:02:46,630
most likely
and he i think followed on to say a

176
00:02:46,630 --> 00:02:46,640
and he i think followed on to say a
 

177
00:02:46,640 --> 00:02:47,589
and he i think followed on to say a
scene from

178
00:02:47,589 --> 00:02:47,599
scene from
 

179
00:02:47,599 --> 00:02:49,270
scene from
an external observer like if somebody

180
00:02:49,270 --> 00:02:49,280
an external observer like if somebody
 

181
00:02:49,280 --> 00:02:50,710
an external observer like if somebody
was watching us

182
00:02:50,710 --> 00:02:50,720
was watching us
 

183
00:02:50,720 --> 00:02:54,150
was watching us
it seems we come up with creative ways

184
00:02:54,150 --> 00:02:54,160
it seems we come up with creative ways
 

185
00:02:54,160 --> 00:02:56,630
it seems we come up with creative ways
of progressing our civilization that's

186
00:02:56,630 --> 00:02:56,640
of progressing our civilization that's
 

187
00:02:56,640 --> 00:02:57,509
of progressing our civilization that's
fun to watch

188
00:02:57,509 --> 00:02:57,519
fun to watch
 

189
00:02:57,519 --> 00:03:00,229
fun to watch
yeah so he exactly he said from the

190
00:03:00,229 --> 00:03:00,239
yeah so he exactly he said from the
 

191
00:03:00,239 --> 00:03:01,670
yeah so he exactly he said from the
standpoint of the observer not the

192
00:03:01,670 --> 00:03:01,680
standpoint of the observer not the
 

193
00:03:01,680 --> 00:03:02,550
standpoint of the observer not the
participant

194
00:03:02,550 --> 00:03:02,560
participant
 

195
00:03:02,560 --> 00:03:04,869
participant
right and so what's interesting about

196
00:03:04,869 --> 00:03:04,879
right and so what's interesting about
 

197
00:03:04,879 --> 00:03:06,070
right and so what's interesting about
that this were

198
00:03:06,070 --> 00:03:06,080
that this were
 

199
00:03:06,080 --> 00:03:07,589
that this were
i think just a couple of freestanding

200
00:03:07,589 --> 00:03:07,599
i think just a couple of freestanding
 

201
00:03:07,599 --> 00:03:09,750
i think just a couple of freestanding
tweets and and delivered

202
00:03:09,750 --> 00:03:09,760
tweets and and delivered
 

203
00:03:09,760 --> 00:03:11,509
tweets and and delivered
without a whole lot of rapper of context

204
00:03:11,509 --> 00:03:11,519
without a whole lot of rapper of context
 

205
00:03:11,519 --> 00:03:12,949
without a whole lot of rapper of context
so it's left to the mind of the

206
00:03:12,949 --> 00:03:12,959
so it's left to the mind of the
 

207
00:03:12,959 --> 00:03:15,430
so it's left to the mind of the
the reader of the tweets yes to infer

208
00:03:15,430 --> 00:03:15,440
the reader of the tweets yes to infer
 

209
00:03:15,440 --> 00:03:16,710
the reader of the tweets yes to infer
what he was talking about but

210
00:03:16,710 --> 00:03:16,720
what he was talking about but
 

211
00:03:16,720 --> 00:03:19,430
what he was talking about but
so that's kind of like it provokes some

212
00:03:19,430 --> 00:03:19,440
so that's kind of like it provokes some
 

213
00:03:19,440 --> 00:03:20,949
so that's kind of like it provokes some
interesting thoughts like first of all

214
00:03:20,949 --> 00:03:20,959
interesting thoughts like first of all
 

215
00:03:20,959 --> 00:03:22,630
interesting thoughts like first of all
it presupposes the existence

216
00:03:22,630 --> 00:03:22,640
it presupposes the existence
 

217
00:03:22,640 --> 00:03:26,149
it presupposes the existence
of an observer and it also presupposes

218
00:03:26,149 --> 00:03:26,159
of an observer and it also presupposes
 

219
00:03:26,159 --> 00:03:27,990
of an observer and it also presupposes
that the observer wishes to be

220
00:03:27,990 --> 00:03:28,000
that the observer wishes to be
 

221
00:03:28,000 --> 00:03:30,550
that the observer wishes to be
entertained and has some mechanism

222
00:03:30,550 --> 00:03:30,560
entertained and has some mechanism
 

223
00:03:30,560 --> 00:03:32,390
entertained and has some mechanism
of enforcing their desire to be

224
00:03:32,390 --> 00:03:32,400
of enforcing their desire to be
 

225
00:03:32,400 --> 00:03:33,750
of enforcing their desire to be
entertained so there's like a lot

226
00:03:33,750 --> 00:03:33,760
entertained so there's like a lot
 

227
00:03:33,760 --> 00:03:35,030
entertained so there's like a lot
underpinning that

228
00:03:35,030 --> 00:03:35,040
underpinning that
 

229
00:03:35,040 --> 00:03:37,350
underpinning that
and to me that suggests particularly

230
00:03:37,350 --> 00:03:37,360
and to me that suggests particularly
 

231
00:03:37,360 --> 00:03:38,710
and to me that suggests particularly
coming from elon

232
00:03:38,710 --> 00:03:38,720
coming from elon
 

233
00:03:38,720 --> 00:03:40,309
coming from elon
that it's a reference to simulation

234
00:03:40,309 --> 00:03:40,319
that it's a reference to simulation
 

235
00:03:40,319 --> 00:03:41,910
that it's a reference to simulation
theory that you know

236
00:03:41,910 --> 00:03:41,920
theory that you know
 

237
00:03:41,920 --> 00:03:44,070
theory that you know
somebody is out there and has far

238
00:03:44,070 --> 00:03:44,080
somebody is out there and has far
 

239
00:03:44,080 --> 00:03:45,910
somebody is out there and has far
greater insights and a far greater

240
00:03:45,910 --> 00:03:45,920
greater insights and a far greater
 

241
00:03:45,920 --> 00:03:46,869
greater insights and a far greater
ability

242
00:03:46,869 --> 00:03:46,879
ability
 

243
00:03:46,879 --> 00:03:48,710
ability
to let's say peer into a single

244
00:03:48,710 --> 00:03:48,720
to let's say peer into a single
 

245
00:03:48,720 --> 00:03:50,070
to let's say peer into a single
individual life

246
00:03:50,070 --> 00:03:50,080
individual life
 

247
00:03:50,080 --> 00:03:51,990
individual life
and find that entertaining and full of

248
00:03:51,990 --> 00:03:52,000
and find that entertaining and full of
 

249
00:03:52,000 --> 00:03:54,149
and find that entertaining and full of
plot twists and surprises and

250
00:03:54,149 --> 00:03:54,159
plot twists and surprises and
 

251
00:03:54,159 --> 00:03:57,030
plot twists and surprises and
either a happier tragic ending or they

252
00:03:57,030 --> 00:03:57,040
either a happier tragic ending or they
 

253
00:03:57,040 --> 00:03:57,670
either a happier tragic ending or they
have a

254
00:03:57,670 --> 00:03:57,680
have a
 

255
00:03:57,680 --> 00:04:00,309
have a
incredible meta view and they can watch

256
00:04:00,309 --> 00:04:00,319
incredible meta view and they can watch
 

257
00:04:00,319 --> 00:04:01,910
incredible meta view and they can watch
the arc of civilization

258
00:04:01,910 --> 00:04:01,920
the arc of civilization
 

259
00:04:01,920 --> 00:04:04,149
the arc of civilization
unfolding in a way that is entertaining

260
00:04:04,149 --> 00:04:04,159
unfolding in a way that is entertaining
 

261
00:04:04,159 --> 00:04:06,070
unfolding in a way that is entertaining
and full of plot twists and surprises

262
00:04:06,070 --> 00:04:06,080
and full of plot twists and surprises
 

263
00:04:06,080 --> 00:04:07,990
and full of plot twists and surprises
and a happy or unhappy ending

264
00:04:07,990 --> 00:04:08,000
and a happy or unhappy ending
 

265
00:04:08,000 --> 00:04:10,390
and a happy or unhappy ending
so okay so we're presupposing an

266
00:04:10,390 --> 00:04:10,400
so okay so we're presupposing an
 

267
00:04:10,400 --> 00:04:11,750
so okay so we're presupposing an
observer

268
00:04:11,750 --> 00:04:11,760
observer
 

269
00:04:11,760 --> 00:04:13,750
observer
then on top of that when you think about

270
00:04:13,750 --> 00:04:13,760
then on top of that when you think about
 

271
00:04:13,760 --> 00:04:17,110
then on top of that when you think about
it you're also presupposing a producer

272
00:04:17,110 --> 00:04:17,120
it you're also presupposing a producer
 

273
00:04:17,120 --> 00:04:20,469
it you're also presupposing a producer
because the act of observation is

274
00:04:20,469 --> 00:04:20,479
because the act of observation is
 

275
00:04:20,479 --> 00:04:22,710
because the act of observation is
mostly fun if there are plot twists and

276
00:04:22,710 --> 00:04:22,720
mostly fun if there are plot twists and
 

277
00:04:22,720 --> 00:04:24,230
mostly fun if there are plot twists and
surprises and other developments that

278
00:04:24,230 --> 00:04:24,240
surprises and other developments that
 

279
00:04:24,240 --> 00:04:25,749
surprises and other developments that
you weren't foreseeing

280
00:04:25,749 --> 00:04:25,759
you weren't foreseeing
 

281
00:04:25,759 --> 00:04:28,790
you weren't foreseeing
i have re-read my own novels and that's

282
00:04:28,790 --> 00:04:28,800
i have re-read my own novels and that's
 

283
00:04:28,800 --> 00:04:29,350
i have re-read my own novels and that's
fun

284
00:04:29,350 --> 00:04:29,360
fun
 

285
00:04:29,360 --> 00:04:31,030
fun
because it's something i worked hard on

286
00:04:31,030 --> 00:04:31,040
because it's something i worked hard on
 

287
00:04:31,040 --> 00:04:32,950
because it's something i worked hard on
and i slaved over and i love

288
00:04:32,950 --> 00:04:32,960
and i slaved over and i love
 

289
00:04:32,960 --> 00:04:34,629
and i slaved over and i love
but there aren't a lot of surprises in

290
00:04:34,629 --> 00:04:34,639
but there aren't a lot of surprises in
 

291
00:04:34,639 --> 00:04:36,070
but there aren't a lot of surprises in
there so now i'm thinking

292
00:04:36,070 --> 00:04:36,080
there so now i'm thinking
 

293
00:04:36,080 --> 00:04:39,189
there so now i'm thinking
we need a producer and an observer for

294
00:04:39,189 --> 00:04:39,199
we need a producer and an observer for
 

295
00:04:39,199 --> 00:04:41,270
we need a producer and an observer for
that to be true and on top of that

296
00:04:41,270 --> 00:04:41,280
that to be true and on top of that
 

297
00:04:41,280 --> 00:04:43,670
that to be true and on top of that
it's got to be a very competent producer

298
00:04:43,670 --> 00:04:43,680
it's got to be a very competent producer
 

299
00:04:43,680 --> 00:04:45,270
it's got to be a very competent producer
because elon said the most

300
00:04:45,270 --> 00:04:45,280
because elon said the most
 

301
00:04:45,280 --> 00:04:47,670
because elon said the most
entertaining outcome is the most likely

302
00:04:47,670 --> 00:04:47,680
entertaining outcome is the most likely
 

303
00:04:47,680 --> 00:04:49,670
entertaining outcome is the most likely
one so there's lots of layers for

304
00:04:49,670 --> 00:04:49,680
one so there's lots of layers for
 

305
00:04:49,680 --> 00:04:51,189
one so there's lots of layers for
thinking about that

306
00:04:51,189 --> 00:04:51,199
thinking about that
 

307
00:04:51,199 --> 00:04:53,350
thinking about that
and when you've got a producer who's

308
00:04:53,350 --> 00:04:53,360
and when you've got a producer who's
 

309
00:04:53,360 --> 00:04:54,950
and when you've got a producer who's
trying to make it entertaining it makes

310
00:04:54,950 --> 00:04:54,960
trying to make it entertaining it makes
 

311
00:04:54,960 --> 00:04:56,310
trying to make it entertaining it makes
me think of there was a south park

312
00:04:56,310 --> 00:04:56,320
me think of there was a south park
 

313
00:04:56,320 --> 00:04:57,110
me think of there was a south park
episode

314
00:04:57,110 --> 00:04:57,120
episode
 

315
00:04:57,120 --> 00:04:58,870
episode
in which earth turned out to be a

316
00:04:58,870 --> 00:04:58,880
in which earth turned out to be a
 

317
00:04:58,880 --> 00:05:00,390
in which earth turned out to be a
reality show yeah

318
00:05:00,390 --> 00:05:00,400
reality show yeah
 

319
00:05:00,400 --> 00:05:03,189
reality show yeah
and somehow we had failed to entertain

320
00:05:03,189 --> 00:05:03,199
and somehow we had failed to entertain
 

321
00:05:03,199 --> 00:05:05,510
and somehow we had failed to entertain
the audience as much as we used to so

322
00:05:05,510 --> 00:05:05,520
the audience as much as we used to so
 

323
00:05:05,520 --> 00:05:06,710
the audience as much as we used to so
the earth show was going to get

324
00:05:06,710 --> 00:05:06,720
the earth show was going to get
 

325
00:05:06,720 --> 00:05:08,950
the earth show was going to get
cancelled et cetera

326
00:05:08,950 --> 00:05:08,960
cancelled et cetera
 

327
00:05:08,960 --> 00:05:10,629
cancelled et cetera
so taking all that together and i'm

328
00:05:10,629 --> 00:05:10,639
so taking all that together and i'm
 

329
00:05:10,639 --> 00:05:12,390
so taking all that together and i'm
obviously being a little bit playful and

330
00:05:12,390 --> 00:05:12,400
obviously being a little bit playful and
 

331
00:05:12,400 --> 00:05:13,909
obviously being a little bit playful and
laying this out

332
00:05:13,909 --> 00:05:13,919
laying this out
 

333
00:05:13,919 --> 00:05:17,029
laying this out
what is the evidence that we have that

334
00:05:17,029 --> 00:05:17,039
what is the evidence that we have that
 

335
00:05:17,039 --> 00:05:19,590
what is the evidence that we have that
there we are in a reality that is

336
00:05:19,590 --> 00:05:19,600
there we are in a reality that is
 

337
00:05:19,600 --> 00:05:21,590
there we are in a reality that is

whether this meme is retweetable or not
 

505
00:08:07,039 --> 00:08:08,950
whether this meme is retweetable or not
yes and so that sort of atomic

506
00:08:08,950 --> 00:08:08,960
yes and so that sort of atomic
 

507
00:08:08,960 --> 00:08:11,990
yes and so that sort of atomic

humans and memes is probably an
 

589
00:09:42,080 --> 00:09:44,150
humans and memes is probably an

oversimplification but maybe a little
 

591
00:09:44,160 --> 00:09:45,910
oversimplification but maybe a little

flowers and bees right do flowers have

594
00:09:48,310 --> 00:09:48,320
flowers and bees right do flowers have
 

595
00:09:48,320 --> 00:09:49,430
flowers and bees right do flowers have
bees or do

596
00:09:49,430 --> 00:09:49,440
bees or do
 

597
00:09:49,440 --> 00:09:52,070
bees or do
bees in a sense have flowers and the

598
00:09:52,070 --> 00:09:52,080
bees in a sense have flowers and the
 

599
00:09:52,080 --> 00:09:53,670
bees in a sense have flowers and the
answer is

600
00:09:53,670 --> 00:09:53,680
answer is
 

601
00:09:53,680 --> 00:09:56,070
answer is
it is a very very symbiotic relationship

602
00:09:56,070 --> 00:09:56,080
it is a very very symbiotic relationship
 

603
00:09:56,080 --> 00:09:57,030
it is a very very symbiotic relationship
in which both

604
00:09:57,030 --> 00:09:57,040
in which both
 

605
00:09:57,040 --> 00:09:59,269
in which both
have semi-independent roles that they

606
00:09:59,269 --> 00:09:59,279
have semi-independent roles that they
 

607
00:09:59,279 --> 00:10:00,310
have semi-independent roles that they
play and

608
00:10:00,310 --> 00:10:00,320
play and
 

609
00:10:00,320 --> 00:10:03,110
play and
both are highly dependent upon the other

610
00:10:03,110 --> 00:10:03,120
both are highly dependent upon the other
 

611
00:10:03,120 --> 00:10:03,750
both are highly dependent upon the other
and so

612
00:10:03,750 --> 00:10:03,760
and so
 

613
00:10:03,760 --> 00:10:05,590
and so
in the case of bees obviously you know

614
00:10:05,590 --> 00:10:05,600
in the case of bees obviously you know
 

615
00:10:05,600 --> 00:10:07,190
in the case of bees obviously you know
you could see the flower as being this

616
00:10:07,190 --> 00:10:07,200
you could see the flower as being this
 

617
00:10:07,200 --> 00:10:08,870
you could see the flower as being this
monolithic structure

618
00:10:08,870 --> 00:10:08,880
monolithic structure
 

619
00:10:08,880 --> 00:10:11,430
monolithic structure
physically in relation to any given bee

620
00:10:11,430 --> 00:10:11,440
physically in relation to any given bee
 

621
00:10:11,440 --> 00:10:13,030
physically in relation to any given bee
and it's the source of

622
00:10:13,030 --> 00:10:13,040
and it's the source of
 

623
00:10:13,040 --> 00:10:14,949
and it's the source of
food and sustenance so you could kind of

624
00:10:14,949 --> 00:10:14,959
food and sustenance so you could kind of
 

625
00:10:14,959 --> 00:10:16,870
food and sustenance so you could kind of
say well flowers have bees

626
00:10:16,870 --> 00:10:16,880
say well flowers have bees
 

627
00:10:16,880 --> 00:10:19,190
say well flowers have bees
but on the other hand the flowers would

628
00:10:19,190 --> 00:10:19,200
but on the other hand the flowers would
 

629
00:10:19,200 --> 00:10:20,630
but on the other hand the flowers would
obviously be doomed

630
00:10:20,630 --> 00:10:20,640
obviously be doomed
 

631
00:10:20,640 --> 00:10:22,150
obviously be doomed
they weren't being pollinated by the

00:10:22,150 --> 00:10:22,160
they weren't being pollinated by the
 

633
00:10:22,160 --> 00:10:24,069
they weren't being pollinated by the
bees so you could kind of say well you

634
00:10:24,069 --> 00:10:24,079
bees so you could kind of say well you
 

635
00:10:24,079 --> 00:10:24,949
bees so you could kind of say well you
know bees

636
00:10:24,949 --> 00:10:24,959
know bees
 

637
00:10:24,959 --> 00:10:26,389
know bees
you know flowers are really expression

638
00:10:26,389 --> 00:10:26,399
you know flowers are really expression
 

639
00:10:26,399 --> 00:10:27,990
you know flowers are really expression
of what the bees need

640
00:10:27,990 --> 00:10:28,000
of what the bees need
 

641
00:10:28,000 --> 00:10:30,870
of what the bees need
and the truth is a symbiosis so with

642
00:10:30,870 --> 00:10:30,880
and the truth is a symbiosis so with
 

643
00:10:30,880 --> 00:10:33,350
and the truth is a symbiosis so with
with memes and human minds

644
00:10:33,350 --> 00:10:33,360
with memes and human minds
 

645
00:10:33,360 --> 00:10:36,949
with memes and human minds
our brains are are clearly the petri

649
00:10:37,920 --> 00:10:40,550

in which memes are either propagated or

00:10:40,550 --> 00:10:40,560
in which memes are either propagated or
 

651
00:10:40,560 --> 00:10:43,030
in which memes are either propagated or
not propagated get mutated or don't get

652
00:10:43,030 --> 00:10:43,040
not propagated get mutated or don't get
 

653
00:10:43,040 --> 00:10:44,150
not propagated get mutated or don't get
mutated if

654
00:10:44,150 --> 00:10:44,160

they are the venue in which competition

656
00:10:47,590 --> 00:10:47,600
they are the venue in which competition
 

657
00:10:47,600 --> 00:10:50,230
they are the venue in which competition
selective competition plays out between

658
00:10:50,230 --> 00:10:50,240
selective competition plays out between
 

659
00:10:50,240 --> 00:10:51,269
selective competition plays out between
different memes

660

different memes
 

661
00:10:51,279 --> 00:10:53,110
different memes
so all of that is very true and you

662
00:10:53,110 --> 00:10:53,120
so all of that is very true and you
 

663
00:10:53,120 --> 00:10:54,949
so all of that is very true and you
could look at that and say

664
00:10:54,949 --> 00:10:54,959
could look at that and say
 

665
00:10:54,959 --> 00:10:58,069
could look at that and say
really the human mind is a production of

really the human mind is a production of

00:10:58,079 --> 00:10:58,630

again this is an oversimplification but
there's kind of two schools of thought

805
00:13:14,320 --> 00:13:16,629
outline
to plot you know so there's plotters and

806
00:13:16,629 --> 00:13:16,639
to plot you know so there's plotters and
 

807
00:13:16,639 --> 00:13:17,990
to plot you know so there's plotters and
pantsers i guess is

808
00:13:17,990 --> 00:13:18,000
pantsers i guess is
 

809
00:13:18,000 --> 00:13:20,710
pantsers i guess is
one way that people look at it and you

810
00:13:20,710 --> 00:13:20,720
one way that people look at it and you
 

811
00:13:20,720 --> 00:13:22,230
one way that people look at it and you
know as with most things

812
00:13:22,230 --> 00:13:22,240
know as with most things
 

813
00:13:22,240 --> 00:13:24,069
know as with most things
there is a great continuum in between

814
00:13:24,069 --> 00:13:24,079
there is a great continuum in between
 

815
00:13:24,079 --> 00:13:25,670
there is a great continuum in between
and i'm somewhere on that continuum but

816
00:13:25,670 --> 00:13:25,680
and i'm somewhere on that continuum but
 

817
00:13:25,680 --> 00:13:27,190
and i'm somewhere on that continuum but
i lean i guess a little bit

818
00:13:27,190 --> 00:13:27,200
i lean i guess a little bit
 

819
00:13:27,200 --> 00:13:29,910
i lean i guess a little bit
a little bit more toward the plotter and

820
00:13:29,910 --> 00:13:29,920
a little bit more toward the plotter and
 

821
00:13:29,920 --> 00:13:30,550
a little bit more toward the plotter and
so

822
00:13:30,550 --> 00:13:30,560

823
00:13:30,560 --> 00:13:33,350

very high proportion of hours that go
 

1015
00:16:49,360 --> 00:16:50,069
very high proportion of hours that go
into just

1016

into just
 

1017
00:16:50,079 --> 00:16:52,069

making it all hang together and sound
 

1019
00:16:52,079 --> 00:16:54,069
making it all hang together and sound
just right so i think that's true of a

1020
00:16:54,069 --> 00:16:54,079
just right so i think that's true of a
 

1021
00:16:54,079 --> 00:16:55,670
just right so i think that's true of a
lot of creative processes i

1022
00:16:55,670 --> 00:16:55,680
lot of creative processes i
 

1023
00:16:55,680 --> 00:16:58,710
lot of creative processes i
i know it's true of sculpture um i

1024
00:16:58,710 --> 00:16:58,720
i know it's true of sculpture um i
 

1025
00:16:58,720 --> 00:17:00,230
i know it's true of sculpture um i
believe it's true of woodwork my dad was

1026
00:17:00,230 --> 00:17:00,240
believe it's true of woodwork my dad was
 

1027
00:17:00,240 --> 00:17:01,829
believe it's true of woodwork my dad was
an amateur woodworker and

1028
00:17:01,829 --> 00:17:01,839
an amateur woodworker and
 

1029
00:17:01,839 --> 00:17:03,430
an amateur woodworker and
he spent a huge amount of time on

1030
00:17:03,430 --> 00:17:03,440
he spent a huge amount of time on
 

1031
00:17:03,440 --> 00:17:05,189
he spent a huge amount of time on
sanding and polishing at the end

1032
00:17:05,189 --> 00:17:05,199
sanding and polishing at the end
 

1033
00:17:05,199 --> 00:17:07,270
sanding and polishing at the end
so i think a great deal of the sparkle

1034
00:17:07,270 --> 00:17:07,280
so i think a great deal of the sparkle
 

1035
00:17:07,280 --> 00:17:08,870
so i think a great deal of the sparkle
comes from that part of the process any

1036
00:17:08,870 --> 00:17:08,880
comes from that part of the process any
 

1037
00:17:08,880 --> 00:17:09,909
comes from that part of the process any
creative process

1038
00:17:09,909 --> 00:17:09,919
creative process
 

1039
00:17:09,919 --> 00:17:12,069
creative process
can i ask about the psychological the

1040
00:17:12,069 --> 00:17:12,079

dramatically mitigate that risk
 

1563
00:26:11,919 --> 00:26:13,590
dramatically mitigate that risk
and i think we do both of those things

1564

and i think we do both of those things
 

1565

think both that

1582
00:26:29,909 --> 00:26:29,919
think both that
 

1583
00:26:29,919 --> 00:26:31,830
think both that
both both risks get managed down but if

1584
00:26:31,830 --> 00:26:31,840
both both risks get managed down but if
 

1585
00:26:31,840 --> 00:26:33,669
both both risks get managed down but if
you take one set of precautions and not

1586
00:26:33,669 --> 00:26:33,679
you take one set of precautions and not
 

1587
00:26:33,679 --> 00:26:34,710
you take one set of precautions and not
the other

1588
00:26:34,710 --> 00:26:34,720
the other
 

1589
00:26:34,720 --> 00:26:36,710
the other
then the the thing that you have not

1590
00:26:36,710 --> 00:26:36,720
then the the thing that you have not
 

1591
00:26:36,720 --> 00:26:38,390
then the the thing that you have not
taken precautions against

1592
00:26:38,390 --> 00:26:38,400
taken precautions against
 

1593
00:26:38,400 --> 00:26:39,990

00:26:39,990 --> 00:26:40,000
immediately becomes the more likely
 

1595
00:26:40,000 --> 00:26:41,990
immediately becomes the more likely
outcome so can we talk about

1596
00:26:41,990 --> 00:26:42,000
outcome so can we talk about
 

1597
00:26:42,000 --> 00:26:44,070
outcome so can we talk about
this kind of research and what's

1598
00:26:44,070 --> 00:26:44,080
this kind of research and what's
 

1599
00:26:44,080 --> 00:26:45,269
this kind of research and what's
actually done and

1600
00:26:45,269 --> 00:26:45,279
actually done and
 

1601
00:26:45,279 --> 00:26:46,950
actually done and
what are the positives and negatives of

1602
00:26:46,950 --> 00:26:46,960
what are the positives and negatives of
 

1603
00:26:46,960 --> 00:26:48,549
what are the positives and negatives of
it so

1604
00:26:48,549 --> 00:26:48,559
it so
 

1605
00:26:48,559 --> 00:26:50,230
it so
if we look at gain of function research

1606
00:26:50,230 --> 00:26:50,240
if we look at gain of function research
 

1607
00:26:50,240 --> 00:26:51,909
if we look at gain of function research
and the kind of stuff that's happening

1608
00:26:51,909 --> 00:26:51,919
and the kind of stuff that's happening
 

1609
00:26:51,919 --> 00:26:53,669
and the kind of stuff that's happening
level three and level four

1610
00:26:53,669 --> 00:26:53,679
level three and level four
 

1611

bsl labs what's the whole idea here is

1612
00:26:56,630 --> 00:26:56,640
bsl labs what's the whole idea here is
 

1613
00:26:56,640 --> 00:26:58,390
bsl labs what's the whole idea here is
it trying to engineer

1614
00:26:58,390 --> 00:26:58,400
it trying to engineer
 

1615
00:26:58,400 --> 00:27:01,350
it trying to engineer
viruses to understand how they behave

1616
00:27:01,350 --> 00:27:01,360
viruses to understand how they behave
 

1617
00:27:01,360 --> 00:27:02,789
viruses to understand how they behave
you want to understand the dangerous

1618
00:27:02,789 --> 00:27:02,799
you want to understand the dangerous
 

1619
00:27:02,799 --> 00:27:03,269
you want to understand the dangerous
ones

1620
00:27:03,269 --> 00:27:03,279
ones
 

1621
00:27:03,279 --> 00:27:05,669
ones
yeah so that that would be the logic

1622
00:27:05,669 --> 00:27:05,679
yeah so that that would be the logic
 

1623
00:27:05,679 --> 00:27:07,430
yeah so that that would be the logic
behind doing it and so gain a function

1624
00:27:07,430 --> 00:27:07,440
behind doing it and so gain a function
 

1625
00:27:07,440 --> 00:27:09,350
behind doing it and so gain a function
can mean a lot of different things

1626
00:27:09,350 --> 00:27:09,360
can mean a lot of different things
 

1627
00:27:09,360 --> 00:27:11,830
can mean a lot of different things
um viewed through a certain lens

1628
00:27:11,830 --> 00:27:11,840
um viewed through a certain lens
 

1629
00:27:11,840 --> 00:27:12,870
um viewed through a certain lens
gain-to-function

1630
00:27:12,870 --> 00:27:12,880
gain-to-function
 

1631
00:27:12,880 --> 00:27:14,789
gain-to-function
research could be what you do when you

1632
00:27:14,789 --> 00:27:14,799
research could be what you do when you
 

1633
00:27:14,799 --> 00:27:16,710
research could be what you do when you
create you know gmos

1634
00:27:16,710 --> 00:27:16,720
create you know gmos
 

1635
00:27:16,720 --> 00:27:19,029
create you know gmos
when you create you know hearty strains

1636
00:27:19,029 --> 00:27:19,039
when you create you know hearty strains
 

1637
00:27:19,039 --> 00:27:21,269
when you create you know hearty strains
of corn that are resistant to pesticides

1638
00:27:21,269 --> 00:27:21,279
of corn that are resistant to pesticides
 

1639
00:27:21,279 --> 00:27:22,470
of corn that are resistant to pesticides
i mean you could view that as gain of

1640
00:27:22,470 --> 00:27:22,480
i mean you could view that as gain of
 

1641
00:27:22,480 --> 00:27:23,190
i mean you could view that as gain of
function

1642
00:27:23,190 --> 00:27:23,200
function
 

1643
00:27:23,200 --> 00:27:24,470
function
so i'm going to refer to gain of

1644
00:27:24,470 --> 00:27:24,480
so i'm going to refer to gain of
 

1645
00:27:24,480 --> 00:27:26,310
so i'm going to refer to gain of
function in a relatively narrow sense

which is actually the sense
 

1649

1661
00:27:40,159 --> 00:27:42,950
more transmissible or more deadly
and in that line of research i'll use an

1662
00:27:42,950 --> 00:27:42,960
and in that line of research i'll use an
 

1663
00:27:42,960 --> 00:27:44,389
and in that line of research i'll use an
example from 2011

example from 2011
 

1665

because it's very illustrative and it's
 

1667
00:27:46,640 --> 00:27:48,149
because it's very illustrative and it's
also very chilling

something called h5n1 flu
 

1685
00:28:03,960 --> 00:28:07,669
something called h5n1 flu
h5n1 is you know something that

1686
00:28:07,669 --> 00:28:07,679
h5n1 is you know something that
 

1687
00:28:07,679 --> 00:28:10,710
h5n1 is you know something that

health organization has a case fatality

1694
00:28:15,110 --> 00:28:15,120

half a percent and one percent h5n1 is

1698
00:28:19,029 --> 00:28:19,039
half a percent and one percent h5n1 is
 

1699
00:28:19,039 --> 00:28:20,310
half a percent and one percent h5n1 is
closer to sixty percent

1700
00:28:20,310 --> 00:28:20,320
closer to sixty percent
 

1701
00:28:20,320 --> 00:28:22,950
closer to sixty percent
six zero and so that's actually even

1702
00:28:22,950 --> 00:28:22,960
six zero and so that's actually even
 

1703
00:28:22,960 --> 00:28:24,470
six zero and so that's actually even
slightly more lethal than ebola

1704
00:28:24,470 --> 00:28:24,480
slightly more lethal than ebola
 

1705
00:28:24,480 --> 00:28:27,510
slightly more lethal than ebola
it's a very very very scary pathogen the

1706
00:28:27,510 --> 00:28:27,520
it's a very very very scary pathogen the
 

1707
00:28:27,520 --> 00:28:29,830
it's a very very very scary pathogen the
good news about h5n1 it is

1708
00:28:29,830 --> 00:28:29,840
good news about h5n1 it is
 

1709
00:28:29,840 --> 00:28:32,870
good news about h5n1 it is
that it is barely barely contagious

1710
00:28:32,870 --> 00:28:32,880
that it is barely barely contagious
 

1711
00:28:32,880 --> 00:28:35,430
that it is barely barely contagious
and i believe it is in no way contagious

1712
00:28:35,430 --> 00:28:35,440
and i believe it is in no way contagious
 

1713
00:28:35,440 --> 00:28:37,510
and i believe it is in no way contagious
human to human it requires

1714
00:28:37,510 --> 00:28:37,520
human to human it requires
 

1715
00:28:37,520 --> 00:28:41,350
human to human it requires
um you know very very very deep contact

1716
00:28:41,350 --> 00:28:41,360
um you know very very very deep contact
 

1717
00:28:41,360 --> 00:28:44,710
um you know very very very deep contact
uh with birds in most cases chickens

1718
00:28:44,710 --> 00:28:44,720
uh with birds in most cases chickens
 

1719
00:28:44,720 --> 00:28:47,190
uh with birds in most cases chickens
and so if you're a chicken farmer and

1720
00:28:47,190 --> 00:28:47,200
and so if you're a chicken farmer and
 

1721
00:28:47,200 --> 00:28:48,630
and so if you're a chicken farmer and
you spend an enormous amount of time

1722
00:28:48,630 --> 00:28:48,640
you spend an enormous amount of time
 

1723
00:28:48,640 --> 00:28:50,710
you spend an enormous amount of time
around them and perhaps you get into

1724
00:28:50,710 --> 00:28:50,720
around them and perhaps you get into
 

1725
00:28:50,720 --> 00:28:52,389
around them and perhaps you get into
situations in which you get a break in

1726
00:28:52,389 --> 00:28:52,399
situations in which you get a break in
 

1727
00:28:52,399 --> 00:28:54,950
situations in which you get a break in
your skin and you're interacting

1728
00:28:54,950 --> 00:28:54,960
your skin and you're interacting
 

1729
00:28:54,960 --> 00:28:58,070
your skin and you're interacting
intensely with with fowl who

1730
00:28:58,070 --> 00:28:58,080
intensely with with fowl who
 

1731
00:28:58,080 --> 00:29:00,470
intensely with with fowl who
as it turns out have h5n1 that's when

1732
00:29:00,470 --> 00:29:00,480
as it turns out have h5n1 that's when
 

1733
00:29:00,480 --> 00:29:01,430
as it turns out have h5n1 that's when
the jump comes

1734
00:29:01,430 --> 00:29:01,440
the jump comes
 

1735
00:29:01,440 --> 00:29:03,190
the jump comes
um but it's not there's no airborne

1736
00:29:03,190 --> 00:29:03,200
um but it's not there's no airborne
 

1737
00:29:03,200 --> 00:29:04,870
um but it's not there's no airborne
transmission that we're aware of human

1738
00:29:04,870 --> 00:29:04,880
transmission that we're aware of human
 

1739
00:29:04,880 --> 00:29:06,070
transmission that we're aware of human
human i mean they're

1740
00:29:06,070 --> 00:29:06,080
human i mean they're
 

1741
00:29:06,080 --> 00:29:09,110
human i mean they're
not that way it just doesn't exist um i

1742
00:29:09,110 --> 00:29:09,120
not that way it just doesn't exist um i
 

1743
00:29:09,120 --> 00:29:09,990
not that way it just doesn't exist um i
think the

1744
00:29:09,990 --> 00:29:10,000
think the
 

1745
00:29:10,000 --> 00:29:11,750
think the
world health organization did a

1746
00:29:11,750 --> 00:29:11,760
world health organization did a
 

1747
00:29:11,760 --> 00:29:14,789
world health organization did a
relentless survey of the number of h5n1

1748
00:29:14,789 --> 00:29:14,799
relentless survey of the number of h5n1
 

1749
00:29:14,799 --> 00:29:16,870
relentless survey of the number of h5n1
cases i think they do it every year i

1750
00:29:16,870 --> 00:29:16,880
cases i think they do it every year i
 

1751
00:29:16,880 --> 00:29:19,029
cases i think they do it every year i
saw one 10-year series

1752
00:29:19,029 --> 00:29:19,039
saw one 10-year series
 

1753
00:29:19,039 --> 00:29:21,430
saw one 10-year series
where i think it was like 500 fatalities

1754
00:29:21,430 --> 00:29:21,440
where i think it was like 500 fatalities
 

1755
00:29:21,440 --> 00:29:22,870
where i think it was like 500 fatalities
over the course of a decade

1756
00:29:22,870 --> 00:29:22,880
over the course of a decade
 

1757
00:29:22,880 --> 00:29:24,870
over the course of a decade
and that's a drop in the bucket kind of

1758
00:29:24,870 --> 00:29:24,880
and that's a drop in the bucket kind of
 

1759
00:29:24,880 --> 00:29:26,470
and that's a drop in the bucket kind of
fun fun fact

1760
00:29:26,470 --> 00:29:26,480
fun fun fact
 

1761
00:29:26,480 --> 00:29:29,110
fun fun fact
i believe the typical lethality from

1762
00:29:29,110 --> 00:29:29,120
i believe the typical lethality from
 

1763
00:29:29,120 --> 00:29:29,669
i believe the typical lethality from
lightning

1764
00:29:29,669 --> 00:29:29,679
lightning
 

1765
00:29:29,679 --> 00:29:32,389
lightning
over 10 years is 70 000 deaths so we

1766
00:29:32,389 --> 00:29:32,399
over 10 years is 70 000 deaths so we
 

1767
00:29:32,399 --> 00:29:33,830
over 10 years is 70 000 deaths so we
think getting struck by lightning pretty

1768
00:29:33,830 --> 00:29:33,840
think getting struck by lightning pretty
 

1769
00:29:33,840 --> 00:29:35,190
think getting struck by lightning pretty
low risk h5n1

1770
00:29:35,190 --> 00:29:35,200
low risk h5n1
 

1771
00:29:35,200 --> 00:29:37,750
low risk h5n1
much much lower than that what happened

1772
00:29:37,750 --> 00:29:37,760
much much lower than that what happened
 

1773
00:29:37,760 --> 00:29:39,269
much much lower than that what happened
in these experiments

1774
00:29:39,269 --> 00:29:39,279
in these experiments
 

1775
00:29:39,279 --> 00:29:42,630
in these experiments
is the experimenters in both cases um

1776
00:29:42,630 --> 00:29:42,640
is the experimenters in both cases um
 

1777
00:29:42,640 --> 00:29:45,029
is the experimenters in both cases um
set out to make h5n1 that would be

1778
00:29:45,029 --> 00:29:45,039
set out to make h5n1 that would be
 

1779
00:29:45,039 --> 00:29:45,750
set out to make h5n1 that would be
contagious

1780
00:29:45,750 --> 00:29:45,760
contagious
 

1781
00:29:45,760 --> 00:29:48,149
contagious
that could create airborne transmission

1782
00:29:48,149 --> 00:29:48,159
that could create airborne transmission
 

1783
00:29:48,159 --> 00:29:50,070
that could create airborne transmission
and so they basically passed it i think

1784
00:29:50,070 --> 00:29:50,080
and so they basically passed it i think
 

1785
00:29:50,080 --> 00:29:52,549
and so they basically passed it i think
in both cases they passed it through

1786
00:29:52,549 --> 00:29:52,559
in both cases they passed it through
 

1787
00:29:52,559 --> 00:29:54,950
in both cases they passed it through
a large number of ferrets and so this

1788
00:29:54,950 --> 00:29:54,960
a large number of ferrets and so this
 

1789
00:29:54,960 --> 00:29:55,909
a large number of ferrets and so this
wasn't like

1790
00:29:55,909 --> 00:29:55,919
wasn't like
 

1791
00:29:55,919 --> 00:29:57,510
wasn't like
crispr there wasn't even a crisper back

1792
00:29:57,510 --> 00:29:57,520
crispr there wasn't even a crisper back
 

1793
00:29:57,520 --> 00:29:59,269
crispr there wasn't even a crisper back
in those days this was relatively

1794
00:29:59,269 --> 00:29:59,279
in those days this was relatively
 

1795
00:29:59,279 --> 00:30:01,510
in those days this was relatively
straightforward you know selecting for a

1796
00:30:01,510 --> 00:30:01,520
straightforward you know selecting for a
 

1797
00:30:01,520 --> 00:30:02,950
straightforward you know selecting for a
particular outcome

1798
00:30:02,950 --> 00:30:02,960
particular outcome
 

1799
00:30:02,960 --> 00:30:05,269
particular outcome
and after guiding the path and passing

1800
00:30:05,269 --> 00:30:05,279
and after guiding the path and passing
 

1801
00:30:05,279 --> 00:30:06,070
and after guiding the path and passing
them through

1802
00:30:06,070 --> 00:30:06,080
them through
 

1803
00:30:06,080 --> 00:30:07,269
them through
again i believe it was a series of

1804
00:30:07,269 --> 00:30:07,279
again i believe it was a series of
 

1805
00:30:07,279 --> 00:30:09,990
again i believe it was a series of
ferrets they did in fact come up with

1806
00:30:09,990 --> 00:30:10,000
ferrets they did in fact come up with
 

1807
00:30:10,000 --> 00:30:12,950
ferrets they did in fact come up with
a version of h5n1 that is capable of

1808
00:30:12,950 --> 00:30:12,960
a version of h5n1 that is capable of
 

1809
00:30:12,960 --> 00:30:14,549
a version of h5n1 that is capable of
airborne transmission

1810
00:30:14,549 --> 00:30:14,559
airborne transmission
 

1811
00:30:14,559 --> 00:30:16,789
airborne transmission
now they didn't unleash it into the

1812
00:30:16,789 --> 00:30:16,799
now they didn't unleash it into the
 

1813
00:30:16,799 --> 00:30:18,070
now they didn't unleash it into the
world they didn't

1814
00:30:18,070 --> 00:30:18,080
world they didn't
 

1815
00:30:18,080 --> 00:30:19,750
world they didn't
inject it into humans to see what would

1816
00:30:19,750 --> 00:30:19,760
inject it into humans to see what would
 

1817
00:30:19,760 --> 00:30:21,990
inject it into humans to see what would
happen and so for those two reasons we

1818
00:30:21,990 --> 00:30:22,000
happen and so for those two reasons we
 

1819
00:30:22,000 --> 00:30:22,470
happen and so for those two reasons we
don't

1820
00:30:22,470 --> 00:30:22,480
don't
 

1821
00:30:22,480 --> 00:30:24,549
don't
really know how contagious it might have

1822
00:30:24,549 --> 00:30:24,559
really know how contagious it might have
 

1823
00:30:24,559 --> 00:30:25,510
really know how contagious it might have
been

1824
00:30:25,510 --> 00:30:25,520
been
 

1825
00:30:25,520 --> 00:30:28,070
been
but you know if it was as contagious as

1826
00:30:28,070 --> 00:30:28,080
but you know if it was as contagious as
 

1827
00:30:28,080 --> 00:30:29,190
but you know if it was as contagious as
covid

1828
00:30:29,190 --> 00:30:29,200
covid
 

1829
00:30:29,200 --> 00:30:31,830
covid
that could be a civilization threatening

1830
00:30:31,830 --> 00:30:31,840
that could be a civilization threatening
 

1831
00:30:31,840 --> 00:30:33,029
that could be a civilization threatening
pathogen

1832
00:30:33,029 --> 00:30:33,039
pathogen
 

1833
00:30:33,039 --> 00:30:35,110
pathogen
and why would you do it well the people

1834
00:30:35,110 --> 00:30:35,120
and why would you do it well the people
 

1835
00:30:35,120 --> 00:30:36,630
and why would you do it well the people
who did it were good guys

1836
00:30:36,630 --> 00:30:36,640
who did it were good guys
 

1837
00:30:36,640 --> 00:30:39,029
who did it were good guys
they were virologists i believe their

1838
00:30:39,029 --> 00:30:39,039
they were virologists i believe their
 

1839
00:30:39,039 --> 00:30:40,870
they were virologists i believe their
agendas they explained it was

1840
00:30:40,870 --> 00:30:40,880
agendas they explained it was
 

1841
00:30:40,880 --> 00:30:43,590
agendas they explained it was
much as you said let's figure out what a

1842
00:30:43,590 --> 00:30:43,600
much as you said let's figure out what a
 

1843
00:30:43,600 --> 00:30:44,870
much as you said let's figure out what a
worst case scenario

1844
00:30:44,870 --> 00:30:44,880
worst case scenario
 

1845
00:30:44,880 --> 00:30:46,710
worst case scenario
might look like so we can understand it

1846
00:30:46,710 --> 00:30:46,720
might look like so we can understand it
 

1847
00:30:46,720 --> 00:30:48,789
might look like so we can understand it
better but

1848
00:30:48,789 --> 00:30:48,799
better but
 

1849
00:30:48,799 --> 00:30:50,470
better but
my understanding is in both cases it was

1850
00:30:50,470 --> 00:30:50,480
my understanding is in both cases it was
 

1851
00:30:50,480 --> 00:30:52,630
my understanding is in both cases it was
done in by bsl3 labs

and so potential of leak uh

1854
00:30:55,669 --> 00:30:55,679
and so potential of leak uh
 

1855
00:30:55,679 --> 00:30:57,990
and so potential of leak uh
significantly non-zero hopefully way

significantly non-zero hopefully way
 

1857
00:30:58,000 --> 00:30:59,830
significantly non-zero hopefully way
below one percent but significantly

1858
00:30:59,830 --> 00:30:59,840
below one percent but significantly
 

1859
00:30:59,840 --> 00:31:00,789

non-zero
 

1861
00:31:00,799 --> 00:31:02,470
non-zero
and when you look at the consequences of

00:31:02,470 --> 00:31:02,480
and when you look at the consequences of
 

1863
00:31:02,480 --> 00:31:05,430
and when you look at the consequences of
an escape in terms of human lives

now you might make an argument

so there is no case for inevitability

1944
00:32:27,269 --> 00:32:27,279
so there is no case for inevitability
 

1945
00:32:27,279 --> 00:32:29,430
so there is no case for inevitability
of this kind of a jump to airborne

of this kind of a jump to airborne
 

1947
00:32:29,440 --> 00:32:30,950
of this kind of a jump to airborne
transmission so

1948
00:32:30,950 --> 00:32:30,960
transmission so
 

1949
00:32:30,960 --> 00:32:32,549

we're not on a freight train to that

we're not on a freight train to that

it's not like there's just one set of

it's not like there's just one set of

it's not like there's just one set of

they're just there's there's all kinds

they're just there's there's all kinds

they're just there's there's all kinds

so we're not actually creating something

so we're not actually creating something
we're inevitably going to face

we're inevitably going to face
 

1973
00:32:53,600 --> 00:32:56,070
we're inevitably going to face
uh but we are creating something we are

the utter virulence that could result
 

2297
00:37:55,359 --> 00:37:56,950
the utter virulence that could result
from gain of function and say

we were

could be found
 

2317

is the question of whether covid
leaked from a lab sort of

00:39:14,400 --> 00:39:16,950
not even answering that question but
even asking that question is a very

gain of function research i mean from a

2390
00:39:27,109 --> 00:39:27,119
gain of function research i mean from a
 

2391
00:39:27,119 --> 00:39:28,630
gain of function research i mean from a
high level

2392

00:39:35,119 --> 00:39:37,510
comfortable asking that question
and two do you think that the answer

2400
00:39:37,510 --> 00:39:37,520
and two do you think that the answer
 

2401
00:39:37,520 --> 00:39:38,950
and two do you think that the answer
could be that it did

could be that it did
 

2403
00:39:38,960 --> 00:39:41,670
could be that it did

2407
00:39:42,960 --> 00:39:45,990
possibility
that it did leak from a lab is

2408
00:39:45,990 --> 00:39:46,000
that it did leak from a lab is
 

2409
00:39:46,000 --> 00:39:49,510
that it did leak from a lab is
evidence enough again for the

uh chernobyl is a good example i come

2616
00:43:21,990 --> 00:43:22,000
uh chernobyl is a good example i come
 

2617
00:43:22,000 --> 00:43:24,390
uh chernobyl is a good example i come
from the soviet union

2618
00:43:24,390 --> 00:43:24,400
from the soviet union
 

2619
00:43:24,400 --> 00:43:28,230
from the soviet union
i mean well major mistakes were made in

2620
00:43:28,230 --> 00:43:28,240
i mean well major mistakes were made in
 

2621
00:43:28,240 --> 00:43:29,270
i mean well major mistakes were made in
chernobyl

2622
00:43:29,270 --> 00:43:29,280
chernobyl
 

2623
00:43:29,280 --> 00:43:33,190
chernobyl
i would argue for a lab league to happen

2624
00:43:33,190 --> 00:43:33,200
i would argue for a lab league to happen
 

2625
00:43:33,200 --> 00:43:37,190
i would argue for a lab league to happen
the the the scale of the mistake is much

2626
00:43:37,190 --> 00:43:37,200
the the the scale of the mistake is much
 

2627
00:43:37,200 --> 00:43:37,910
the the the scale of the mistake is much
smaller

2628
00:43:37,910 --> 00:43:37,920
smaller
 

2629
00:43:37,920 --> 00:43:41,750
smaller
um right there the the depth and the

2630
00:43:41,750 --> 00:43:41,760
um right there the the depth and the
 

2631
00:43:41,760 --> 00:43:44,870
um right there the the depth and the
breadth of rot

2632
00:43:44,870 --> 00:43:44,880
breadth of rot
 

2633
00:43:44,880 --> 00:43:46,950
breadth of rot
that in bureaucracy that led to

is much bigger than anything that could

2641
00:43:51,520 --> 00:43:54,230
lead to
a lab leak because it could literally

a lab leak because it could literally
 

2643
00:43:54,240 --> 00:43:54,790
a lab leak because it could literally
just be

00:47:29,270 --> 00:47:29,280
the the risk of an artificial one even

the near-term risk of an artificial one
 

2849
00:47:31,680 --> 00:47:33,990
the near-term risk of an artificial one
ups the urgency around these measures

2850
00:47:33,990 --> 00:47:34,000
ups the urgency around these measures
 

2851
00:47:34,000 --> 00:47:34,790
ups the urgency around these measures
immensely but

2852
00:47:34,790 --> 00:47:34,800
immensely but
 

2853
00:47:34,800 --> 00:47:36,870
immensely but
but most of them would be broadly

2854
00:47:36,870 --> 00:47:36,880
but most of them would be broadly
 

2855
00:47:36,880 --> 00:47:38,870
but most of them would be broadly
applicable and so i think

2856
00:47:38,870 --> 00:47:38,880
applicable and so i think
 

2857
00:47:38,880 --> 00:47:40,470
applicable and so i think
the first thing that we really want to

2858
00:47:40,470 --> 00:47:40,480
the first thing that we really want to
 

2859
00:47:40,480 --> 00:47:42,069
the first thing that we really want to
do on a global scale

2860
00:47:42,069 --> 00:47:42,079
do on a global scale
 

2861
00:47:42,079 --> 00:47:45,109
do on a global scale
is have a far far far more robust

2862
00:47:45,109 --> 00:47:45,119
is have a far far far more robust
 

2863
00:47:45,119 --> 00:47:47,910
is have a far far far more robust
and globally transparent system of

2864
00:47:47,910 --> 00:47:47,920
and globally transparent system of
 

2865
00:47:47,920 --> 00:47:49,190
and globally transparent system of
detection

2866
00:47:49,190 --> 00:47:49,200
detection
 

2867
00:47:49,200 --> 00:47:51,109
detection
and that can happen on a number of

2868
00:47:51,109 --> 00:47:51,119
and that can happen on a number of
 

2869
00:47:51,119 --> 00:47:53,270
and that can happen on a number of
levels the most obvious one

2870
00:47:53,270 --> 00:47:53,280
levels the most obvious one
 

2871
00:47:53,280 --> 00:47:56,549
levels the most obvious one
is you know just in the blood of people

2872
00:47:56,549 --> 00:47:56,559
is you know just in the blood of people
 

2873
00:47:56,559 --> 00:47:57,750
is you know just in the blood of people
who come into clinics

2874
00:47:57,750 --> 00:47:57,760
who come into clinics
 

2875
00:47:57,760 --> 00:48:01,190
who come into clinics
exhibiting signs of illness and there

2876
00:48:01,190 --> 00:48:01,200
exhibiting signs of illness and there
 

2877
00:48:01,200 --> 00:48:04,150
exhibiting signs of illness and there
we are certainly at a point now with

obviously we proved capable of when we

so do that on a global basis

2962

so do that on a global basis
 

2963
00:49:24,079 --> 00:49:25,589
so do that on a global basis
and i don't think that's irrational

but also there's just an unbelievable
 

3013
00:50:09,839 --> 00:50:11,750

public health benefit from that
 

3015
00:50:11,760 --> 00:50:13,430
public health benefit from that
and it's sort of a three-tier system

3016
00:50:13,430 --> 00:50:13,440
and it's sort of a three-tier system
 

3017
00:50:13,440 --> 00:50:15,910
and it's sort of a three-tier system
where clinicians in the field

where clinicians in the field
 

3019
00:50:15,920 --> 00:50:19,109
where clinicians in the field
could very rapidly determine do you have

one of the infections of acute interest
 

3023
00:50:21,280 --> 00:50:22,950
one of the infections of acute interest
here either because it's very common in

3024
00:50:22,950 --> 00:50:22,960
here either because it's very common in
 

3025
00:50:22,960 --> 00:50:23,670
here either because it's very common in
this region

3026
00:50:23,670 --> 00:50:23,680
this region
 

3027
00:50:23,680 --> 00:50:25,750
this region
so we want to diagnose as many as things

3028
00:50:25,750 --> 00:50:25,760
so we want to diagnose as many as things
 

3029
00:50:25,760 --> 00:50:27,430
so we want to diagnose as many as things
as we can at the front line

3030
00:50:27,430 --> 00:50:27,440
as we can at the front line
 

3031
00:50:27,440 --> 00:50:29,109
as we can at the front line
or because it's uncommon but

3032
00:50:29,109 --> 00:50:29,119
or because it's uncommon but
 

3033
00:50:29,119 --> 00:50:31,190
or because it's uncommon but
unbelievably threatening like ebola

unbelievably threatening like ebola
 

3035
00:50:31,200 --> 00:50:32,950
unbelievably threatening like ebola
so frontline worker can make that

3036
00:50:32,950 --> 00:50:32,960
so frontline worker can make that
 

3037
00:50:32,960 --> 00:50:35,270
so frontline worker can make that
determination very very rapidly

3038
00:50:35,270 --> 00:50:35,280
determination very very rapidly
 

3039
00:50:35,280 --> 00:50:38,230
determination very very rapidly
if it comes up as a we don't know they

3040
00:50:38,230 --> 00:50:38,240
if it comes up as a we don't know they
 

3041
00:50:38,240 --> 00:50:40,069
if it comes up as a we don't know they
bump it up to a level that's more like

3042
00:50:40,069 --> 00:50:40,079
bump it up to a level that's more like
 

3043
00:50:40,079 --> 00:50:40,950
bump it up to a level that's more like
at a fully

3044
00:50:40,950 --> 00:50:40,960
at a fully
 

3045
00:50:40,960 --> 00:50:42,950
at a fully
configured doctor's office or local

configured doctor's office or local
 

3047
00:50:42,960 --> 00:50:44,790
configured doctor's office or local
hospital and if it's still it

3048
00:50:44,790 --> 00:50:44,800
hospital and if it's still it
 

3049
00:50:44,800 --> 00:50:46,150
hospital and if it's still it
we don't know it gets bumped up to a

3050
00:50:46,150 --> 00:50:46,160
we don't know it gets bumped up to a
 

3051
00:50:46,160 --> 00:50:48,230
we don't know it gets bumped up to a
national level and

3052
00:50:48,230 --> 00:50:48,240
national level and
 

3053
00:50:48,240 --> 00:50:50,069
national level and
that and it gets bumped very very

3054
00:50:50,069 --> 00:50:50,079
that and it gets bumped very very
 

3055
00:50:50,079 --> 00:50:51,829
that and it gets bumped very very
rapidly so

3056
00:50:51,829 --> 00:50:51,839
rapidly so
 

3057
00:50:51,839 --> 00:50:54,390
rapidly so
if this can be done in nigeria and it

3058
00:50:54,390 --> 00:50:54,400
if this can be done in nigeria and it
 

3059
00:50:54,400 --> 00:50:56,390
if this can be done in nigeria and it
seems that it can be

3060
00:50:56,390 --> 00:50:56,400
seems that it can be
 

3061
00:50:56,400 --> 00:50:58,230
seems that it can be
there shouldn't be any inhibition for it

3062
00:50:58,230 --> 00:50:58,240
there shouldn't be any inhibition for it
 

3063
00:50:58,240 --> 00:51:00,549
there shouldn't be any inhibition for it
to happen in most other places

that doing something like sentinel in

helped with that

3092
00:51:25,430 --> 00:51:25,440
helped with that
 

3093
00:51:25,440 --> 00:51:27,589
helped with that
but start with that level of detection

something that was done
 

3157
00:52:28,240 --> 00:52:31,109
something that was done
with a norad like budget yeah yeah so i

3158

with a norad like budget yeah yeah so i
 

3159
00:52:31,119 --> 00:52:31,589
with a norad like budget yeah yeah so i
mean

3160

mean
 

3161
00:52:31,599 --> 00:52:33,270

starting with detection that's something

3162
00:52:33,270 --> 00:52:33,280
starting with detection that's something
 

3163

3247
00:53:57,760 --> 00:54:01,030

3249
00:54:01,040 --> 00:54:02,710

dark thing which really is bothering me

3250
00:54:02,710 --> 00:54:02,720
dark thing which really is bothering me
 

3251
00:54:02,720 --> 00:54:05,349
dark thing which really is bothering me
about 2020 which it requires

about 2020 which it requires
 

3253
00:54:05,359 --> 00:54:10,069
about 2020 which it requires
is it requires trust in institutions to

3254
00:54:10,069 --> 00:54:10,079
is it requires trust in institutions to
 

3255
00:54:10,079 --> 00:54:12,150
is it requires trust in institutions to
carry out these kinds of programs

3256
00:54:12,150 --> 00:54:12,160
carry out these kinds of programs
 

3257
00:54:12,160 --> 00:54:14,549
carry out these kinds of programs
and it requires trust and science and

3258
00:54:14,549 --> 00:54:14,559
and it requires trust and science and
 

3259
00:54:14,559 --> 00:54:15,910
and it requires trust and science and
engineers

that would operate at scale here

that would operate at scale here
 

3265
00:54:20,960 --> 00:54:24,870
that would operate at scale here
and much of that trust has been um

3266
00:54:24,870 --> 00:54:24,880
and much of that trust has been um
 

3267
00:54:24,880 --> 00:54:27,670
and much of that trust has been um
at least in the united states diminished

3268

at least in the united states diminished
 

3269
00:54:27,680 --> 00:54:29,030

it feels like
 

3271
00:54:29,040 --> 00:54:30,790
it feels like
not exactly sure where to place the

3272
00:54:30,790 --> 00:54:30,800
not exactly sure where to place the
 

3273
00:54:30,800 --> 00:54:33,430
not exactly sure where to place the
blame but i do place quite a bit of the

3274
00:54:33,430 --> 00:54:33,440
blame but i do place quite a bit of the
 

3275
00:54:33,440 --> 00:54:34,470
blame but i do place quite a bit of the
blame into

blame into

in speaking down to people at times
 

3283
00:54:42,160 --> 00:54:44,789
in speaking down to people at times
speaking from authority it sounded like

3284
00:54:44,789 --> 00:54:44,799
speaking from authority it sounded like
 

3285
00:54:44,799 --> 00:54:46,950
speaking from authority it sounded like
it dismissed the basic human experience

3286
00:54:46,950 --> 00:54:46,960
it dismissed the basic human experience
 

3287
00:54:46,960 --> 00:54:47,349
it dismissed the basic human experience
or the

way
 

3293
00:54:50,960 --> 00:54:53,109
way
like it almost sounded like there's an

00:54:53,109 --> 00:54:53,119
like it almost sounded like there's an
 

3295
00:54:53,119 --> 00:54:54,789
like it almost sounded like there's an
agenda

agenda
 

3297
00:54:54,799 --> 00:54:56,870
agenda
that's hidden behind the words the

that's hidden behind the words the
 

3299
00:54:56,880 --> 00:54:57,990
that's hidden behind the words the
scientists spoke

3300
00:54:57,990 --> 00:54:58,000
scientists spoke
 

3301
00:54:58,000 --> 00:54:59,750
scientists spoke
like they're trying to in a

00:54:59,750 --> 00:54:59,760
like they're trying to in a
 

3303

like they're trying to in a
self-preserving way

control the population or something like
 

3307
00:55:02,960 --> 00:55:05,349
control the population or something like
that i don't think any of that is true

3308
00:55:05,349 --> 00:55:05,359
that i don't think any of that is true
 

3309
00:55:05,359 --> 00:55:06,710
that i don't think any of that is true
from the majority of the scientific

00:55:06,710 --> 00:55:06,720
from the majority of the scientific
 

3311
00:55:06,720 --> 00:55:08,630
from the majority of the scientific

community but it sounded that way
 

3313
00:55:08,640 --> 00:55:11,270

and so the trust began to diminish and

3314
00:55:11,270 --> 00:55:11,280
and so the trust began to diminish and
 

3315
00:55:11,280 --> 00:55:11,990
and so the trust began to diminish and
i'm not

i'm not

00:55:12,000 --> 00:55:15,589
i'm not
sure how to fix that except to

think is essential for forming trust

3344
00:55:39,270 --> 00:55:39,280
think is essential for forming trust
 

3345
00:55:39,280 --> 00:55:40,789
think is essential for forming trust
but i don't know what to make of it it's

but i don't know what to make of it it's
 

3347
00:55:40,799 --> 00:55:43,589
but i don't know what to make of it it's
been uh it's been deeply disappointing

3348
00:55:43,589 --> 00:55:43,599
been uh it's been deeply disappointing
 

3349
00:55:43,599 --> 00:55:45,510
been uh it's been deeply disappointing
because i do think just like you

yeah and i think part of the problem is

00:55:57,190 --> 00:55:57,200
yeah and i think part of the problem is

yeah and i think part of the problem is
it seems to me as an outsider that there

it seems to me as an outsider that there

it seems to me as an outsider that there
was a bizarre unwillingness

was a bizarre unwillingness
 

3363
00:56:00,880 --> 00:56:02,549
was a bizarre unwillingness
on the part of the cdc and other

maybe they had a patronizing idea that

maybe they had a patronizing idea that
 

3375

maybe they had a patronizing idea that
these people need to be

these people need to be
 

3377
00:56:14,960 --> 00:56:17,030
these people need to be
told and when they're told they need to

and so when they whip saw on
 

3389
00:56:25,680 --> 00:56:27,109
and so when they whip saw on
recommendations like

3390
00:56:27,109 --> 00:56:27,119
recommendations like
 

3391
00:56:27,119 --> 00:56:29,190
recommendations like
what you should do about masks you know

3392
00:56:29,190 --> 00:56:29,200
what you should do about masks you know
 

3393
00:56:29,200 --> 00:56:30,789
what you should do about masks you know

anything don't wear them when the real

anything don't wear them when the real
 

3401
00:56:37,280 --> 00:56:39,190
anything don't wear them when the real
driver for that was

3402
00:56:39,190 --> 00:56:39,200
driver for that was
 

3403
00:56:39,200 --> 00:56:41,190
driver for that was
we don't want these clowns going out and

3404
00:56:41,190 --> 00:56:41,200
we don't want these clowns going out and
 

3405
00:56:41,200 --> 00:56:44,069
we don't want these clowns going out and
depleting amazon of masks because they

3406
00:56:44,069 --> 00:56:44,079
depleting amazon of masks because they
 

3407
00:56:44,079 --> 00:56:45,430
depleting amazon of masks because they
may be needed

3408
00:56:45,430 --> 00:56:45,440
may be needed
 

3409
00:56:45,440 --> 00:56:48,710
may be needed
in medical settings and we just don't

3410
00:56:48,710 --> 00:56:48,720
in medical settings and we just don't
 

3411
00:56:48,720 --> 00:56:49,670
in medical settings and we just don't
know yet

3412
00:56:49,670 --> 00:56:49,680
know yet
 

3413
00:56:49,680 --> 00:56:51,990
know yet
i think a message that actually

3414
00:56:51,990 --> 00:56:52,000
i think a message that actually
 

3415
00:56:52,000 --> 00:56:53,750
i think a message that actually
respected people and said this is why

3416
00:56:53,750 --> 00:56:53,760
respected people and said this is why
 

3417
00:56:53,760 --> 00:56:55,829
respected people and said this is why
we're asking you not to do masks yet

3418
00:56:55,829 --> 00:56:55,839
we're asking you not to do masks yet
 

3419
00:56:55,839 --> 00:56:58,390
we're asking you not to do masks yet
and there's more to be seen would be

3420
00:56:58,390 --> 00:56:58,400
and there's more to be seen would be
 

3421
00:56:58,400 --> 00:56:59,750
and there's more to be seen would be
less whip sawing

3422
00:56:59,750 --> 00:56:59,760
less whip sawing
 

3423
00:56:59,760 --> 00:57:02,309
less whip sawing
and would bring people like they feel

3424
00:57:02,309 --> 00:57:02,319
and would bring people like they feel
 

3425
00:57:02,319 --> 00:57:03,430
and would bring people like they feel
more like they're part of the

more like they're part of the
 

3427
00:57:03,440 --> 00:57:04,950
more like they're part of the
conversation and they're being treated

3428
00:57:04,950 --> 00:57:04,960
conversation and they're being treated
 

3429
00:57:04,960 --> 00:57:05,990

like adults

3430

like adults
 

3431
00:57:06,000 --> 00:57:08,470
like adults
than saying one day definitively masks

3432
00:57:08,470 --> 00:57:08,480
than saying one day definitively masks
 

3433
00:57:08,480 --> 00:57:09,270
than saying one day definitively masks
suck

3434
00:57:09,270 --> 00:57:09,280
suck
 

3435
00:57:09,280 --> 00:57:11,430
suck
and then x days later saying nope damn

3436
00:57:11,430 --> 00:57:11,440
and then x days later saying nope damn
 

3437
00:57:11,440 --> 00:57:12,789
and then x days later saying nope damn
it wear masks

3438
00:57:12,789 --> 00:57:12,799
it wear masks
 

3439
00:57:12,799 --> 00:57:15,109
it wear masks
and so i think framing things in terms

3440
00:57:15,109 --> 00:57:15,119
and so i think framing things in terms
 

3441
00:57:15,119 --> 00:57:16,549
and so i think framing things in terms
of the probabilities which most people

3442
00:57:16,549 --> 00:57:16,559
of the probabilities which most people
 

3443
00:57:16,559 --> 00:57:17,910
of the probabilities which most people
are easy to parse i mean

3444
00:57:17,910 --> 00:57:17,920
are easy to parse i mean
 

3445
00:57:17,920 --> 00:57:20,710
are easy to parse i mean
a more recent example which i just

3446
00:57:20,710 --> 00:57:20,720
a more recent example which i just
 

3447
00:57:20,720 --> 00:57:21,190
a more recent example which i just
thought was

3448
00:57:21,190 --> 00:57:21,200
thought was
 

3449
00:57:21,200 --> 00:57:24,230
thought was
batty was suspending the johnson johnson

3450
00:57:24,230 --> 00:57:24,240
batty was suspending the johnson johnson
 

3451
00:57:24,240 --> 00:57:27,510
batty was suspending the johnson johnson
vaccine for a you know a very low single

3452
00:57:27,510 --> 00:57:27,520
vaccine for a you know a very low single
 

3453
00:57:27,520 --> 00:57:29,109

digit number of days

3454
00:57:29,109 --> 00:57:29,119
digit number of days
 

3455
00:57:29,119 --> 00:57:31,510
digit number of days
in the united states based on the fact

3456
00:57:31,510 --> 00:57:31,520
in the united states based on the fact
 

3457
00:57:31,520 --> 00:57:32,390
in the united states based on the fact
that i believe

3458
00:57:32,390 --> 00:57:32,400
that i believe
 

3459
00:57:32,400 --> 00:57:35,270
that i believe
there had been uh seven-ish clotting

3460
00:57:35,270 --> 00:57:35,280
there had been uh seven-ish clotting
 

3461
00:57:35,280 --> 00:57:36,390
there had been uh seven-ish clotting
incidents

3462
00:57:36,390 --> 00:57:36,400
incidents
 

3463
00:57:36,400 --> 00:57:39,430
incidents
um in roughly seven million people who

3464
00:57:39,430 --> 00:57:39,440
um in roughly seven million people who
 

3465
00:57:39,440 --> 00:57:42,150
um in roughly seven million people who
had had the the vaccine administered

3466
00:57:42,150 --> 00:57:42,160
had had the the vaccine administered
 

3467
00:57:42,160 --> 00:57:43,910
had had the the vaccine administered
i believe one of which resulted in a

3468
00:57:43,910 --> 00:57:43,920
i believe one of which resulted in a
 

3469
00:57:43,920 --> 00:57:45,510
i believe one of which resulted in a
fatality and

3470
00:57:45,510 --> 00:57:45,520
fatality and
 

3471
00:57:45,520 --> 00:57:47,589
fatality and
there was definitely suggestive data

3472
00:57:47,589 --> 00:57:47,599
there was definitely suggestive data
 

3473
00:57:47,599 --> 00:57:49,190
there was definitely suggestive data
that indicated that there was a

3474
00:57:49,190 --> 00:57:49,200
that indicated that there was a
 

3475
00:57:49,200 --> 00:57:50,549
that indicated that there was a
relationship this wasn't just

3476
00:57:50,549 --> 00:57:50,559
relationship this wasn't just
 

3477
00:57:50,559 --> 00:57:52,470
relationship this wasn't just
coincidental because i think all of the

3478
00:57:52,470 --> 00:57:52,480
coincidental because i think all of the
 

3479
00:57:52,480 --> 00:57:54,230
coincidental because i think all of the
clotting incidents happened in women as

3480
00:57:54,230 --> 00:57:54,240
clotting incidents happened in women as
 

3481
00:57:54,240 --> 00:57:55,349
clotting incidents happened in women as
opposed to men

3482
00:57:55,349 --> 00:57:55,359

it's something about the way the
communication actually happens

3596
00:59:43,030 --> 00:59:43,040
communication actually happens
 

3597
00:59:43,040 --> 00:59:45,430
communication actually happens
just i don't know what it is about

3598
00:59:45,430 --> 00:59:45,440
just i don't know what it is about
 

3599
00:59:45,440 --> 00:59:47,510
just i don't know what it is about
anthony fauci for example

3600
00:59:47,510 --> 00:59:47,520
anthony fauci for example
 

3601
00:59:47,520 --> 00:59:50,470
anthony fauci for example
but i don't trust him and i think that

3602
00:59:50,470 --> 00:59:50,480
but i don't trust him and i think that
 

3603
00:59:50,480 --> 00:59:50,789
but i don't trust him and i think that
has

3604
00:59:50,789 --> 00:59:50,799
has
 

3605
00:59:50,799 --> 00:59:53,910
has
to do i mean he's he did he's

3606
00:59:53,910 --> 00:59:53,920
to do i mean he's he did he's
 

3607
00:59:53,920 --> 00:59:56,230
to do i mean he's he did he's
he has an incredible background i'm sure

3608
00:59:56,230 --> 00:59:56,240
he has an incredible background i'm sure
 

3609
00:59:56,240 --> 00:59:57,190
he has an incredible background i'm sure
he's a brilliant

3610
00:59:57,190 --> 00:59:57,200
he's a brilliant
 

3611
00:59:57,200 --> 00:59:59,829
he's a brilliant
scientist and researcher i'm sure he's

3612
00:59:59,829 --> 00:59:59,839
scientist and researcher i'm sure he's
 

3613
00:59:59,839 --> 01:00:01,990
scientist and researcher i'm sure he's
also a great

3614
01:00:01,990 --> 01:00:02,000
also a great
 

3615
01:00:02,000 --> 01:00:04,150
also a great
like inside the room policy maker and

3616
01:00:04,150 --> 01:00:04,160
like inside the room policy maker and
 

3617
01:00:04,160 --> 01:00:06,069
like inside the room policy maker and
deliberator and so on

3618
01:00:06,069 --> 01:00:06,079
deliberator and so on
 

3619
01:00:06,079 --> 01:00:09,750
deliberator and so on
but you know uh what makes a great

3620
01:00:09,750 --> 01:00:09,760
but you know uh what makes a great
 

3621
01:00:09,760 --> 01:00:10,230
but you know uh what makes a great
leader

3622
01:00:10,230 --> 01:00:10,240
leader
 

3623
01:00:10,240 --> 01:00:12,150
leader
is something about that thing that you

3624
01:00:12,150 --> 01:00:12,160
is something about that thing that you
 

3625
01:00:12,160 --> 01:00:13,990
is something about that thing that you
can't quite describe

3626
01:00:13,990 --> 01:00:14,000
can't quite describe
 

3627
01:00:14,000 --> 01:00:18,150
can't quite describe
but being a communicator that

3628
01:00:18,150 --> 01:00:18,160
but being a communicator that
 

3629
01:00:18,160 --> 01:00:21,510
but being a communicator that
you know you can trust that there's an

3630
01:00:21,510 --> 01:00:21,520
you know you can trust that there's an
 

3631
01:00:21,520 --> 01:00:23,510
you know you can trust that there's an
authenticity that's required and i'm not

3632
01:00:23,510 --> 01:00:23,520
authenticity that's required and i'm not
 

3633
01:00:23,520 --> 01:00:24,870
authenticity that's required and i'm not
sure

3634
01:00:24,870 --> 01:00:24,880
sure
 

3635
01:00:24,880 --> 01:00:27,109
sure
maybe i'm being a bit too judgmental but

3636
01:00:27,109 --> 01:00:27,119
maybe i'm being a bit too judgmental but
 

3637
01:00:27,119 --> 01:00:27,990
maybe i'm being a bit too judgmental but
i'm a huge fan

3638
01:00:27,990 --> 01:00:28,000
i'm a huge fan
 

3639
01:00:28,000 --> 01:00:29,750
i'm a huge fan
of a lot of great leaders throughout

3640
01:00:29,750 --> 01:00:29,760
of a lot of great leaders throughout
 

3641
01:00:29,760 --> 01:00:32,870
of a lot of great leaders throughout
history they've they've communicated

3642
01:00:32,870 --> 01:00:32,880
history they've they've communicated
 

3643
01:00:32,880 --> 01:00:34,870
history they've they've communicated
exceptionally well in the way that fauci

3644
01:00:34,870 --> 01:00:34,880
exceptionally well in the way that fauci
 

3645
01:00:34,880 --> 01:00:36,630
exceptionally well in the way that fauci
does not

3646
01:00:36,630 --> 01:00:36,640
does not
 

3647
01:00:36,640 --> 01:00:38,710
does not
and i think about that i think about

3648
01:00:38,710 --> 01:00:38,720
and i think about that i think about
 

3649
01:00:38,720 --> 01:00:40,470
and i think about that i think about
what has affected science communication

3650
01:00:40,470 --> 01:00:40,480
what has affected science communication
 

3651
01:00:40,480 --> 01:00:40,950
what has affected science communication
so

3652
01:00:40,950 --> 01:00:40,960
so
 

3653
01:00:40,960 --> 01:00:42,870
so
you know great leaders throughout

3654
01:00:42,870 --> 01:00:42,880
you know great leaders throughout
 

3655
01:00:42,880 --> 01:00:44,470
you know great leaders throughout
history did not necessarily

3656
01:00:44,470 --> 01:00:44,480
history did not necessarily
 

3657
01:00:44,480 --> 01:00:47,030
history did not necessarily
need to be great science communicators

3658
01:00:47,030 --> 01:00:47,040
need to be great science communicators
 

3659
01:00:47,040 --> 01:00:48,549
need to be great science communicators
their leadership wasn't

3660
01:00:48,549 --> 01:00:48,559
their leadership wasn't
 

3661
01:00:48,559 --> 01:00:49,910
their leadership wasn't
in other domains but when you're

3662
01:00:49,910 --> 01:00:49,920
in other domains but when you're
 

3663
01:00:49,920 --> 01:00:51,750
in other domains but when you're
fighting the virus you also have to be

3664
01:00:51,750 --> 01:00:51,760
fighting the virus you also have to be
 

3665
01:00:51,760 --> 01:00:53,990
fighting the virus you also have to be
a great science communicator you have to

3666
01:00:53,990 --> 01:00:54,000
a great science communicator you have to
 

3667
01:00:54,000 --> 01:00:56,069
a great science communicator you have to
be able to communicate uncertainties

3668
01:00:56,069 --> 01:00:56,079
be able to communicate uncertainties
 

3669
01:00:56,079 --> 01:00:57,750
be able to communicate uncertainties
you have to be able to communicate

3670
01:00:57,750 --> 01:00:57,760
you have to be able to communicate
 

3671
01:00:57,760 --> 01:00:59,349
you have to be able to communicate
something like a vaccine

3672
01:00:59,349 --> 01:00:59,359
something like a vaccine
 

3673
01:00:59,359 --> 01:01:01,510
something like a vaccine
that you you're allowing inside your

3674
01:01:01,510 --> 01:01:01,520
that you you're allowing inside your
 

3675
01:01:01,520 --> 01:01:03,109
that you you're allowing inside your
body into the messiness into the

3676
01:01:03,109 --> 01:01:03,119
body into the messiness into the
 

3677
01:01:03,119 --> 01:01:05,270
body into the messiness into the
complexity of the biology system

3678
01:01:05,270 --> 01:01:05,280
complexity of the biology system
 

3679
01:01:05,280 --> 01:01:06,870
complexity of the biology system
that if we're being honest it's so

3680
01:01:06,870 --> 01:01:06,880
that if we're being honest it's so
 

3681
01:01:06,880 --> 01:01:08,549
that if we're being honest it's so
complex we'll never be able to really

3682
01:01:08,549 --> 01:01:08,559
complex we'll never be able to really
 

3683
01:01:08,559 --> 01:01:10,710
complex we'll never be able to really
understand we have

3684
01:01:10,710 --> 01:01:10,720
understand we have
 

3685
01:01:10,720 --> 01:01:12,390
understand we have
we can only desperately hope that

3686
01:01:12,390 --> 01:01:12,400
we can only desperately hope that
 

3687
01:01:12,400 --> 01:01:13,750
we can only desperately hope that
science can

3688
01:01:13,750 --> 01:01:13,760
science can
 

3689
01:01:13,760 --> 01:01:16,870
science can
give us sort of a high likelihood that

3690
01:01:16,870 --> 01:01:16,880
give us sort of a high likelihood that
 

3691
01:01:16,880 --> 01:01:17,990
give us sort of a high likelihood that
there's no

3692
01:01:17,990 --> 01:01:18,000
there's no
 

3693
01:01:18,000 --> 01:01:20,630
there's no
short-term negative consequences and

3694
01:01:20,630 --> 01:01:20,640
short-term negative consequences and
 

3695
01:01:20,640 --> 01:01:22,549
short-term negative consequences and
that kind of intuition about long-term

3696
01:01:22,549 --> 01:01:22,559
that kind of intuition about long-term
 

3697
01:01:22,559 --> 01:01:23,990
that kind of intuition about long-term
negative consequences

3698
01:01:23,990 --> 01:01:24,000
negative consequences
 

3699
01:01:24,000 --> 01:01:26,069
negative consequences
and doing our best in this battle

3700
01:01:26,069 --> 01:01:26,079
and doing our best in this battle
 

3701
01:01:26,079 --> 01:01:27,030
and doing our best in this battle
against

3702
01:01:27,030 --> 01:01:27,040
against
 

3703
01:01:27,040 --> 01:01:29,589
against
trillions of things that are trying to

01:01:29,589 --> 01:01:29,599
trillions of things that are trying to
 

3705
01:01:29,599 --> 01:01:30,950
trillions of things that are trying to
kill us

3706
01:01:30,950 --> 01:01:30,960
kill us
 

3707
01:01:30,960 --> 01:01:33,430
kill us
i mean being being an effective

3708
01:01:33,430 --> 01:01:33,440
i mean being being an effective
 

3709
01:01:33,440 --> 01:01:34,710
i mean being being an effective
communicator in that space is very

3710
01:01:34,710 --> 01:01:34,720
communicator in that space is very
 

3711
01:01:34,720 --> 01:01:36,069
communicator in that space is very
difficult but

3712
01:01:36,069 --> 01:01:36,079
difficult but
 

3713
01:01:36,079 --> 01:01:39,109
difficult but
i think about what it takes because i

3714
01:01:39,109 --> 01:01:39,119
i think about what it takes because i
 

3715
01:01:39,119 --> 01:01:40,470
i think about what it takes because i
think there should be more science

3716
01:01:40,470 --> 01:01:40,480
think there should be more science
 

3717
01:01:40,480 --> 01:01:42,069
think there should be more science
communicators that are effective at that

kind of thing

01:01:43,510 --> 01:01:43,520
kind of thing
 

3721
01:01:43,520 --> 01:01:45,030
kind of thing
let me ask you about something that's

3722

let me ask you about something that's
 

3723
01:01:45,040 --> 01:01:47,990
let me ask you about something that's
sort of more in the ai space that

sort of more in the ai space that

sort of more in the ai space that
i i think about that kind of goes along

don't see any problem with that except

don't see any problem with that except
 

3797
01:03:12,720 --> 01:03:14,870
don't see any problem with that except
um i do worry about the data security

01:03:38,720 --> 01:03:41,910
um i think if you conjured up
worst-case genomes of viruses that

um then you have to worry about the

3836
01:03:54,150 --> 01:03:54,160
um then you have to worry about the
 

3837
01:03:54,160 --> 01:03:56,549
um then you have to worry about the

probably always continue to happen and
so that would be the danger of doing the

01:05:08,160 --> 01:05:09,349
sorry progress on for years and years
but i think there's like a there's a

01:05:09,349 --> 01:05:09,359
but i think there's like a there's a
 

3917
01:05:09,359 --> 01:05:11,510
but i think there's like a there's a
bi-annual competition i think

3918
01:05:11,510 --> 01:05:11,520
bi-annual competition i think
 

3919
01:05:11,520 --> 01:05:14,230
bi-annual competition i think

01:05:14,230 --> 01:05:14,240
uh for for at which people tackle the
 

3921
01:05:14,240 --> 01:05:16,309
uh for for at which people tackle the
protein folding uh problem

3922
01:05:16,309 --> 01:05:16,319
protein folding uh problem
 

3923
01:05:16,319 --> 01:05:19,430
protein folding uh problem
and um deepmind's entrant uh both

3924
01:05:19,430 --> 01:05:19,440
and um deepmind's entrant uh both
 

3925
01:05:19,440 --> 01:05:22,150
and um deepmind's entrant uh both
two years ago like in 2018 and 2020

3926
01:05:22,150 --> 01:05:22,160
two years ago like in 2018 and 2020
 

3927
01:05:22,160 --> 01:05:23,430
two years ago like in 2018 and 2020
ruled the field

3928
01:05:23,430 --> 01:05:23,440
ruled the field
 

3929
01:05:23,440 --> 01:05:25,910
ruled the field
and so you know protein folding is an

3930
01:05:25,910 --> 01:05:25,920
and so you know protein folding is an
 

3931
01:05:25,920 --> 01:05:27,589
and so you know protein folding is an
unbelievably important thing if you want

3932
01:05:27,589 --> 01:05:27,599
unbelievably important thing if you want
 

3933
01:05:27,599 --> 01:05:28,870
unbelievably important thing if you want
to start thinking about

3934
01:05:28,870 --> 01:05:28,880
to start thinking about
 

3935
01:05:28,880 --> 01:05:31,270
to start thinking about
therapeutics because you know it's the

3936
01:05:31,270 --> 01:05:31,280
therapeutics because you know it's the
 

3937
01:05:31,280 --> 01:05:32,710
therapeutics because you know it's the
folding of the protein that tells us

3938
01:05:32,710 --> 01:05:32,720
folding of the protein that tells us
 

3939
01:05:32,720 --> 01:05:33,109
folding of the protein that tells us
where the

3940

01:05:34,710 --> 01:05:34,720
where the channels and the receptors and
 

3943
01:05:34,720 --> 01:05:37,190
where the channels and the receptors and
everything else are on that protein and

3944
01:05:37,190 --> 01:05:37,200
everything else are on that protein and
 

3945
01:05:37,200 --> 01:05:37,829
everything else are on that protein and
it's

3946
01:05:37,829 --> 01:05:37,839
it's
 

3947
01:05:37,839 --> 01:05:40,069
it's
from that precise model if we can get to

3948
01:05:40,069 --> 01:05:40,079
from that precise model if we can get to
 

3949
01:05:40,079 --> 01:05:41,270
from that precise model if we can get to
a precise model

a precise model
 

3951
01:05:41,280 --> 01:05:43,349
a precise model
that you can start barraging it again in

01:05:43,349 --> 01:05:43,359
that you can start barraging it again in

how might we treat that so i see nothing

how might we treat that so i see nothing
 

3973
01:06:00,240 --> 01:06:01,670
how might we treat that so i see nothing
but good in that

well let me ask you about fear and hope

01:06:04,390 --> 01:06:04,400
well let me ask you about fear and hope
 

3977
01:06:04,400 --> 01:06:06,069
well let me ask you about fear and hope
in this world

01:06:06,079 --> 01:06:09,829
in this world
i tend to believe that um

3980
01:06:09,829 --> 01:06:09,839

 

3981
01:06:09,839 --> 01:06:11,829

that uh in terms of competence and

that uh in terms of competence and
 

3983
01:06:11,839 --> 01:06:13,670
that uh in terms of competence and
malevolence

3984
01:06:13,670 --> 01:06:13,680
malevolence
 

3985
01:06:13,680 --> 01:06:15,910
malevolence
that people who are maybe it's in my

that people who are maybe it's in my
 

3987

i tend to see that first of all i

3990
01:06:19,029 --> 01:06:19,039
i tend to see that first of all i
 

3991
01:06:19,039 --> 01:06:20,950
i tend to see that first of all i
believe that most people are good

3992
01:06:20,950 --> 01:06:20,960
believe that most people are good
 

3993
01:06:20,960 --> 01:06:24,150
believe that most people are good
and want to do good and are just

3994
01:06:24,150 --> 01:06:24,160
and want to do good and are just
 

3995
01:06:24,160 --> 01:06:27,029
and want to do good and are just
better doing good and more inclined to

3996
01:06:27,029 --> 01:06:27,039
better doing good and more inclined to
 

3997
01:06:27,039 --> 01:06:27,589
better doing good and more inclined to
do good

3998
01:06:27,589 --> 01:06:27,599
do good
 

3999
01:06:27,599 --> 01:06:30,870
do good
on this world and more than that

4000
01:06:30,870 --> 01:06:30,880
on this world and more than that
 

4001
01:06:30,880 --> 01:06:34,230
on this world and more than that
people who are malevolent are usually

4002
01:06:34,230 --> 01:06:34,240
people who are malevolent are usually
 

4003
01:06:34,240 --> 01:06:37,829
people who are malevolent are usually
incompetent at uh building technology

4004
01:06:37,829 --> 01:06:37,839
incompetent at uh building technology
 

4005
01:06:37,839 --> 01:06:40,390
incompetent at uh building technology
so like i i've seen this in my life that

4006
01:06:40,390 --> 01:06:40,400
so like i i've seen this in my life that
 

4007
01:06:40,400 --> 01:06:42,069
so like i i've seen this in my life that
people who are exceptionally good at

4008
01:06:42,069 --> 01:06:42,079
people who are exceptionally good at
 

4009
01:06:42,079 --> 01:06:42,710
people who are exceptionally good at
stuff

4010
01:06:42,710 --> 01:06:42,720
stuff
 

4011
01:06:42,720 --> 01:06:45,750
stuff
no matter what the stuff is tend to

4012
01:06:45,750 --> 01:06:45,760
no matter what the stuff is tend to
 

4013
01:06:45,760 --> 01:06:48,710
no matter what the stuff is tend to
maybe they discover joy in life in a way

4014
01:06:48,710 --> 01:06:48,720
maybe they discover joy in life in a way
 

4015
01:06:48,720 --> 01:06:49,270
maybe they discover joy in life in a way
that

4016
01:06:49,270 --> 01:06:49,280
that
 

4017
01:06:49,280 --> 01:06:52,309
that
gives them fulfillment and thereby does

4018
01:06:52,309 --> 01:06:52,319
gives them fulfillment and thereby does
 

4019
01:06:52,319 --> 01:06:53,990
gives them fulfillment and thereby does
not result in them wanting to destroy

4020
01:06:53,990 --> 01:06:54,000
not result in them wanting to destroy
 

4021
01:06:54,000 --> 01:06:54,870
not result in them wanting to destroy
the world

4022
01:06:54,870 --> 01:06:54,880
the world
 

4023
01:06:54,880 --> 01:06:57,029
the world
so like the better you are at stuff

4024
01:06:57,029 --> 01:06:57,039
so like the better you are at stuff
 

4025
01:06:57,039 --> 01:06:58,870
so like the better you are at stuff
whether that's building nuclear weapons

4026
01:06:58,870 --> 01:06:58,880
whether that's building nuclear weapons

01:06:58,880 --> 01:06:59,750
whether that's building nuclear weapons

it doesn't matter they're both the less
likely you are to destroy the world

01:07:03,589 --> 01:07:03,599
likely you are to destroy the world
 

4033
01:07:03,599 --> 01:07:07,670
likely you are to destroy the world
so in that sense with many technologies

4034
01:07:07,670 --> 01:07:07,680
so in that sense with many technologies
 

4035
01:07:07,680 --> 01:07:12,230
so in that sense with many technologies
the ai especially i always think that uh

the defenses
 

4045
01:07:20,960 --> 01:07:23,990
the defenses

destroy the world
now there's a few spaces where them

now there's a few spaces where them
 

4053
01:07:32,160 --> 01:07:33,589
now there's a few spaces where them
that might not be the case and that's an

that might not be the case and that's an
 

4055

that might not be the case and that's an
interesting conversation where

interesting conversation where
 

4057
01:07:35,280 --> 01:07:37,190
interesting conversation where
is this one person who's not very

can destroy the whole world perhaps

4062
01:07:40,470 --> 01:07:40,480
can destroy the whole world perhaps

synbio is one such space

4064
01:07:42,789 --> 01:07:42,799
synbio is one such space
 

4065
01:07:42,799 --> 01:07:45,829
synbio is one such space
because of the uh exponential effects of

i tend to believe ai's is not one of

4070
01:07:49,510 --> 01:07:49,520
i tend to believe ai's is not one of
 

4071

i tend to believe ai's is not one of

those such spaces
 

4073
01:07:50,720 --> 01:07:54,829
those such spaces
but do you share this kind of view that

4074
01:07:54,829 --> 01:07:54,839
but do you share this kind of view that
 

4075
01:07:54,839 --> 01:07:57,829
but do you share this kind of view that
uh the ultra competent are usually also

4076
01:07:57,829 --> 01:07:57,839
uh the ultra competent are usually also
 

4077
01:07:57,839 --> 01:07:58,549
uh the ultra competent are usually also
the good

4078
01:07:58,549 --> 01:07:58,559
the good
 

4079
01:07:58,559 --> 01:08:00,950
the good
yeah absolutely i absolutely share that

4080
01:08:00,950 --> 01:08:00,960
yeah absolutely i absolutely share that
 

4081
01:08:00,960 --> 01:08:02,309
yeah absolutely i absolutely share that
and that gives me

4082
01:08:02,309 --> 01:08:02,319
and that gives me
 

4083
01:08:02,319 --> 01:08:04,390
and that gives me
a great deal of optimism that we will be

4084
01:08:04,390 --> 01:08:04,400
a great deal of optimism that we will be
 

4085
01:08:04,400 --> 01:08:05,829
a great deal of optimism that we will be
able to short circuit

4086
01:08:05,829 --> 01:08:05,839
able to short circuit
 

4087
01:08:05,839 --> 01:08:09,190
able to short circuit
the threat that malevolent synbio

4088
01:08:09,190 --> 01:08:09,200
the threat that malevolent synbio
 

4089
01:08:09,200 --> 01:08:11,270
the threat that malevolent synbio
could pose to us but we need to start

4090
01:08:11,270 --> 01:08:11,280
could pose to us but we need to start
 

4091
01:08:11,280 --> 01:08:13,190
could pose to us but we need to start
creating those defensive systems

4092
01:08:13,190 --> 01:08:13,200
creating those defensive systems
 

4093
01:08:13,200 --> 01:08:14,950
creating those defensive systems
or defensive layers one of which we

4094
01:08:14,950 --> 01:08:14,960
or defensive layers one of which we
 

4095
01:08:14,960 --> 01:08:16,789
or defensive layers one of which we
talked about far far far better

4096
01:08:16,789 --> 01:08:16,799
talked about far far far better
 

4097
01:08:16,799 --> 01:08:18,709
talked about far far far better
surveillance in order to prevail

4098
01:08:18,709 --> 01:08:18,719
surveillance in order to prevail
 

4099
01:08:18,719 --> 01:08:22,550
surveillance in order to prevail
so the good guys will almost inevitably

4100
01:08:22,550 --> 01:08:22,560
so the good guys will almost inevitably
 

4101
01:08:22,560 --> 01:08:24,789
so the good guys will almost inevitably
outsmart and definitely outnumber the

4102
01:08:24,789 --> 01:08:24,799
outsmart and definitely outnumber the
 

4103
01:08:24,799 --> 01:08:25,990
outsmart and definitely outnumber the
bad guys

4104
01:08:25,990 --> 01:08:26,000
bad guys
 

4105
01:08:26,000 --> 01:08:28,550
bad guys
in most sort of smackdowns that we can

01:08:28,550 --> 01:08:28,560
in most sort of smackdowns that we can

but the good guys aren't going to be

but the good guys aren't going to be

the good guys
but that doesn't make it possible for us

4170
01:09:27,910 --> 01:09:27,920
but that doesn't make it possible for us
 

4171
01:09:27,920 --> 01:09:30,229
but that doesn't make it possible for us
to stop mass shootings

4172
01:09:30,229 --> 01:09:30,239
to stop mass shootings
 

4173
01:09:30,239 --> 01:09:33,590
to stop mass shootings
an example is fort hood

4174
01:09:33,590 --> 01:09:33,600
an example is fort hood

4177
01:09:36,960 --> 01:09:38,870
45 000 trained soldiers on that base
yet there have been two mass shootings

4178
01:09:38,870 --> 01:09:38,880
yet there have been two mass shootings
 

4179
01:09:38,880 --> 01:09:40,470
yet there have been two mass shootings
there and

4180
01:09:40,470 --> 01:09:40,480
there and
 

4181
01:09:40,480 --> 01:09:43,829
there and
so there is an asymmetry when you have

4182
01:09:43,829 --> 01:09:43,839
so there is an asymmetry when you have
 

4183
01:09:43,839 --> 01:09:47,110
so there is an asymmetry when you have

here but i too am very optimistic

the thing that i sometimes worry about

the thing that i sometimes worry about
 

4517
01:15:23,520 --> 01:15:25,030
the thing that i sometimes worry about
is

4518
01:15:25,030 --> 01:15:25,040
is
 

4519
01:15:25,040 --> 01:15:26,550
is
the fact that we haven't seen

4520
01:15:26,550 --> 01:15:26,560

makes me think um well there's a lot of

makes me think um well there's a lot of
 

4527
01:15:33,040 --> 01:15:34,390
makes me think um well there's a lot of
explanations but one of them that

4528
01:15:34,390 --> 01:15:34,400
explanations but one of them that
 

4529
01:15:34,400 --> 01:15:36,709
explanations but one of them that
worries me is that

4530
01:15:36,709 --> 01:15:36,719
worries me is that
 

4531
01:15:36,719 --> 01:15:39,350
worries me is that
whenever they get smart they just

4532
01:15:39,350 --> 01:15:39,360
whenever they get smart they just
 

4533
01:15:39,360 --> 01:15:40,790
whenever they get smart they just
destroy themselves oh yeah

4534
01:15:40,790 --> 01:15:40,800
destroy themselves oh yeah
 

4535
01:15:40,800 --> 01:15:43,590

hurdles just isn't worth it compared to
 

4733
01:19:11,199 --> 01:19:12,550
hurdles just isn't worth it compared to
what could be done

4734
01:19:12,550 --> 01:19:12,560
what could be done
 

4735
01:19:12,560 --> 01:19:15,189
what could be done
you know where one already is so you

4736
01:19:15,189 --> 01:19:15,199
you know where one already is so you
 

4737
01:19:15,199 --> 01:19:16,790
you know where one already is so you
talked about

4738
01:19:16,790 --> 01:19:16,800
talked about
 

4739
01:19:16,800 --> 01:19:18,630
talked about
diagnostics at scale as a possible

solution
 

4743
01:19:19,920 --> 01:19:23,189
solution
to future pandemics what about another

to future pandemics what about another

01:19:23,199 --> 01:19:24,630
to future pandemics what about another
possible solution which is

01:19:24,630 --> 01:19:24,640
possible solution which is
 

4747
01:19:24,640 --> 01:19:27,350
possible solution which is
kind of creating a backup copy you know

4748
01:19:27,350 --> 01:19:27,360
kind of creating a backup copy you know
 

4749
01:19:27,360 --> 01:19:28,390
kind of creating a backup copy you know
i'm actually now

4750
01:19:28,390 --> 01:19:28,400
i'm actually now
 

4751
01:19:28,400 --> 01:19:31,430
i'm actually now
um putting together nas for backup for

4752
01:19:31,430 --> 01:19:31,440
um putting together nas for backup for
 

4753
01:19:31,440 --> 01:19:33,270
um putting together nas for backup for
myself for the first time taking backup

4754
01:19:33,270 --> 01:19:33,280
myself for the first time taking backup
 

4755
01:19:33,280 --> 01:19:34,870
myself for the first time taking backup
of data seriously

4756
01:19:34,870 --> 01:19:34,880
of data seriously
 

4757
01:19:34,880 --> 01:19:36,870
of data seriously
but if we were to take the uh the backup

4758
01:19:36,870 --> 01:19:36,880
but if we were to take the uh the backup
 

4759
01:19:36,880 --> 01:19:39,030
but if we were to take the uh the backup
of human consciousness seriously and uh

4760
01:19:39,030 --> 01:19:39,040
of human consciousness seriously and uh
 

4761
01:19:39,040 --> 01:19:40,790
of human consciousness seriously and uh
try to expand throughout the

try to expand throughout the
 

4763
01:19:40,800 --> 01:19:43,110

solar system and colonize other planets
 

4765
01:19:43,120 --> 01:19:45,830
solar system and colonize other planets
do you think that's an interesting uh

4766
01:19:45,830 --> 01:19:45,840
do you think that's an interesting uh
 

4767
01:19:45,840 --> 01:19:49,189
do you think that's an interesting uh
solution one of many uh for

4768
01:19:49,189 --> 01:19:49,199
solution one of many uh for
 

4769
01:19:49,199 --> 01:19:50,950
solution one of many uh for
protecting human civilizations from

protecting human civilizations from
 

4771
01:19:50,960 --> 01:19:53,270
protecting human civilizations from
self-destruction sort of humans becoming

a multi-planetary species
 

4775
01:19:54,719 --> 01:19:56,470
a multi-planetary species
oh absolutely i mean i find it

4776
01:19:56,470 --> 01:19:56,480
oh absolutely i mean i find it
 

4777
01:19:56,480 --> 01:19:58,070
oh absolutely i mean i find it
electrifying first of all so i got a

4778
01:19:58,070 --> 01:19:58,080
electrifying first of all so i got a
 

4779
01:19:58,080 --> 01:19:59,750
electrifying first of all so i got a
little bit of a personal bias when i was

4780
01:19:59,750 --> 01:19:59,760
little bit of a personal bias when i was
 

4781
01:19:59,760 --> 01:20:00,550
little bit of a personal bias when i was
a kid

4782
01:20:00,550 --> 01:20:00,560
a kid
 

4783
01:20:00,560 --> 01:20:01,830
a kid
i thought there was nothing cooler than

4784
01:20:01,830 --> 01:20:01,840
i thought there was nothing cooler than
 

4785
01:20:01,840 --> 01:20:03,030
i thought there was nothing cooler than
rockets i thought there was nothing

4786
01:20:03,030 --> 01:20:03,040
rockets i thought there was nothing
 

4787
01:20:03,040 --> 01:20:04,470
rockets i thought there was nothing
cooler than nasa

4788
01:20:04,470 --> 01:20:04,480
cooler than nasa
 

4789
01:20:04,480 --> 01:20:06,070
cooler than nasa
i thought there was nothing cooler than

4790
01:20:06,070 --> 01:20:06,080
i thought there was nothing cooler than
 

4791
01:20:06,080 --> 01:20:07,910
i thought there was nothing cooler than
people walking on the moon

4792
01:20:07,910 --> 01:20:07,920
people walking on the moon
 

4793
01:20:07,920 --> 01:20:10,229
people walking on the moon
and as i grew up i thought there was

4794
01:20:10,229 --> 01:20:10,239
and as i grew up i thought there was
 

4795
01:20:10,239 --> 01:20:11,910
and as i grew up i thought there was
nothing more tragic than the fact that

4796
01:20:11,910 --> 01:20:11,920
nothing more tragic than the fact that
 

4797
01:20:11,920 --> 01:20:13,669
nothing more tragic than the fact that
we went from walking on the moon to

4798
01:20:13,669 --> 01:20:13,679
we went from walking on the moon to
 

4799
01:20:13,679 --> 01:20:15,270
we went from walking on the moon to
at best getting to something like

4800
01:20:15,270 --> 01:20:15,280
at best getting to something like
 

4801
01:20:15,280 --> 01:20:17,110
at best getting to something like
suborbital altitude

4802
01:20:17,110 --> 01:20:17,120
suborbital altitude
 

4803
01:20:17,120 --> 01:20:19,669
suborbital altitude
and just i found that more and more

4804
01:20:19,669 --> 01:20:19,679
and just i found that more and more
 

4805
01:20:19,679 --> 01:20:22,070
and just i found that more and more
depressing with the passage of decades

4806
01:20:22,070 --> 01:20:22,080
depressing with the passage of decades
 

4807
01:20:22,080 --> 01:20:25,510
depressing with the passage of decades
at just the colossal expense of

4808
01:20:25,510 --> 01:20:25,520
at just the colossal expense of
 

4809
01:20:25,520 --> 01:20:27,830
at just the colossal expense of
you know manned space travel and the

4810
01:20:27,830 --> 01:20:27,840
you know manned space travel and the
 

4811
01:20:27,840 --> 01:20:29,110
you know manned space travel and the
fact that it seemed that we were

4812
01:20:29,110 --> 01:20:29,120
fact that it seemed that we were
 

4813
01:20:29,120 --> 01:20:30,629
fact that it seemed that we were
unlikely to ever get back to the moon

4814
01:20:30,629 --> 01:20:30,639
unlikely to ever get back to the moon
 

4815
01:20:30,639 --> 01:20:31,669
unlikely to ever get back to the moon
level on mars

4816
01:20:31,669 --> 01:20:31,679
level on mars
 

4817
01:20:31,679 --> 01:20:34,709
level on mars
so i have a boundless appreciation for

4818
01:20:34,709 --> 01:20:34,719
so i have a boundless appreciation for
 

4819
01:20:34,719 --> 01:20:36,709
so i have a boundless appreciation for
elon musk for many reasons but the fact

4820
01:20:36,709 --> 01:20:36,719
elon musk for many reasons but the fact
 

4821
01:20:36,719 --> 01:20:37,430
elon musk for many reasons but the fact
that he has put

4822
01:20:37,430 --> 01:20:37,440
that he has put
 

4823
01:20:37,440 --> 01:20:40,470
that he has put
mars on the incredible agenda is one of

4824
01:20:40,470 --> 01:20:40,480
mars on the incredible agenda is one of
 

4825
01:20:40,480 --> 01:20:41,830
mars on the incredible agenda is one of
the things that i appreciate

4826
01:20:41,830 --> 01:20:41,840
the things that i appreciate
 

4827
01:20:41,840 --> 01:20:44,070
the things that i appreciate
immensely so there's just this sort of

4828
01:20:44,070 --> 01:20:44,080
immensely so there's just this sort of
 

4829
01:20:44,080 --> 01:20:46,070
immensely so there's just this sort of
space nerd in me that just says god

4830
01:20:46,070 --> 01:20:46,080
space nerd in me that just says god
 

4831
01:20:46,080 --> 01:20:47,189
space nerd in me that just says god
that's cool

4832
01:20:47,189 --> 01:20:47,199
that's cool
 

4833
01:20:47,199 --> 01:20:49,110
that's cool
but on a more practical level we were

4834
01:20:49,110 --> 01:20:49,120
but on a more practical level we were
 

4835
01:20:49,120 --> 01:20:50,550
but on a more practical level we were
talking about

4836
01:20:50,550 --> 01:20:50,560
talking about
 

4837
01:20:50,560 --> 01:20:53,910
talking about
you know uh potentially inhabiting

4838
01:20:53,910 --> 01:20:53,920
you know uh potentially inhabiting
 

4839
01:20:53,920 --> 01:20:54,709
you know uh potentially inhabiting
planets

4840
01:20:54,709 --> 01:20:54,719
planets
 

4841
01:20:54,719 --> 01:20:57,189
planets
that aren't our own and we're thinking

4842
01:20:57,189 --> 01:20:57,199
that aren't our own and we're thinking
 

4843
01:20:57,199 --> 01:20:59,110
that aren't our own and we're thinking
about a benign civilization

4844
01:20:59,110 --> 01:20:59,120
about a benign civilization
 

4845
01:20:59,120 --> 01:21:02,709
about a benign civilization
that would do that in in planetary

4846
01:21:02,709 --> 01:21:02,719
that would do that in in planetary
 

4847
01:21:02,719 --> 01:21:04,070
that would do that in in planetary
circumstances

4848
01:21:04,070 --> 01:21:04,080
circumstances
 

4849
01:21:04,080 --> 01:21:05,990
circumstances
where we're not causing other conscious

4850
01:21:05,990 --> 01:21:06,000
where we're not causing other conscious
 

4851
01:21:06,000 --> 01:21:07,350
where we're not causing other conscious
systems to suffer

4852
01:21:07,350 --> 01:21:07,360
systems to suffer
 

4853
01:21:07,360 --> 01:21:09,030
systems to suffer
i mean mars is a place that's very

4854
01:21:09,030 --> 01:21:09,040
i mean mars is a place that's very
 

4855
01:21:09,040 --> 01:21:11,189
i mean mars is a place that's very
promising there may be microbial life

4856
01:21:11,189 --> 01:21:11,199
promising there may be microbial life
 

4857
01:21:11,199 --> 01:21:12,470
promising there may be microbial life
there and i hope there is and if we

4858
01:21:12,470 --> 01:21:12,480
there and i hope there is and if we
 

4859
01:21:12,480 --> 01:21:13,430
there and i hope there is and if we
found it i think it would be

4860
01:21:13,430 --> 01:21:13,440
found it i think it would be
 

4861
01:21:13,440 --> 01:21:14,790
found it i think it would be
electrifying

4862
01:21:14,790 --> 01:21:14,800
electrifying
 

4863
01:21:14,800 --> 01:21:17,510
electrifying
but i think ultimately the moral

4864
01:21:17,510 --> 01:21:17,520
but i think ultimately the moral
 

4865
01:21:17,520 --> 01:21:18,629
but i think ultimately the moral
judgment would be made

4866
01:21:18,629 --> 01:21:18,639
judgment would be made
 

4867
01:21:18,639 --> 01:21:20,550
judgment would be made
that you know the continued thriving of

4868
01:21:20,550 --> 01:21:20,560
that you know the continued thriving of
 

4869
01:21:20,560 --> 01:21:22,470
that you know the continued thriving of
that microbial life

4870
01:21:22,470 --> 01:21:22,480
that microbial life
 

4871
01:21:22,480 --> 01:21:25,510
that microbial life
is of less concern than creating a

4872
01:21:25,510 --> 01:21:25,520
is of less concern than creating a
 

4873
01:21:25,520 --> 01:21:27,030
is of less concern than creating a
habitable planet to humans which would

4874
01:21:27,030 --> 01:21:27,040
habitable planet to humans which would
 

4875
01:21:27,040 --> 01:21:27,510
habitable planet to humans which would
be a

4876
01:21:27,510 --> 01:21:27,520
be a
 

4877
01:21:27,520 --> 01:21:29,669
be a
project on the many thousands of years

4878
01:21:29,669 --> 01:21:29,679
project on the many thousands of years
 

4879
01:21:29,679 --> 01:21:31,590
project on the many thousands of years
scale but i don't think that that would

4880
01:21:31,590 --> 01:21:31,600
scale but i don't think that that would
 

4881
01:21:31,600 --> 01:21:31,990
scale but i don't think that that would
be

4882
01:21:31,990 --> 01:21:32,000
be
 

4883
01:21:32,000 --> 01:21:34,709
be
a greatly immoral act and if that

4884
01:21:34,709 --> 01:21:34,719
a greatly immoral act and if that
 

4885
01:21:34,719 --> 01:21:36,790
a greatly immoral act and if that
happened and if mars became

4886
01:21:36,790 --> 01:21:36,800
happened and if mars became
 

4887
01:21:36,800 --> 01:21:39,030
happened and if mars became
you know home to a self-sustaining group

you know home to a self-sustaining group

you know home to a self-sustaining group
of humans

4890
01:21:39,990 --> 01:21:40,000

4891
01:21:40,000 --> 01:21:41,590
of humans
that could survive a catastrophic

that could survive a catastrophic
 

4893
01:21:41,600 --> 01:21:43,189
that could survive a catastrophic
mistake here on earth

4894

then yeah the fact that we have a backup

4896
01:21:44,709 --> 01:21:44,719
then yeah the fact that we have a backup
 

4897
01:21:44,719 --> 01:21:46,709
then yeah the fact that we have a backup
quality is great and if we could make

4898
01:21:46,709 --> 01:21:46,719
quality is great and if we could make
 

4899
01:21:46,719 --> 01:21:47,030
quality is great and if we could make
more

4900
01:21:47,030 --> 01:21:47,040
more
 

4901
01:21:47,040 --> 01:21:49,110
more
i'm sorry not backup colony backup copy

4902
01:21:49,110 --> 01:21:49,120
i'm sorry not backup colony backup copy
 

4903
01:21:49,120 --> 01:21:51,110
i'm sorry not backup colony backup copy
is great and if we can make more and

4904
01:21:51,110 --> 01:21:51,120
is great and if we can make more and
 

4905
01:21:51,120 --> 01:21:52,390
is great and if we can make more and
more such backup

4906
01:21:52,390 --> 01:21:52,400
more such backup
 

4907
01:21:52,400 --> 01:21:54,870
more such backup
copies throughout the solar system by

01:21:54,870 --> 01:21:54,880

4911
01:21:56,880 --> 01:21:58,709

else it is maybe even venus we could get

4912
01:21:58,709 --> 01:21:58,719
else it is maybe even venus we could get
 

4913
01:21:58,719 --> 01:21:59,270
else it is maybe even venus we could get
rid of

4914
01:21:59,270 --> 01:21:59,280
rid of
 

4915
01:21:59,280 --> 01:22:01,270
rid of
three quarters of its atmosphere and you

4916
01:22:01,270 --> 01:22:01,280
three quarters of its atmosphere and you
 

4917
01:22:01,280 --> 01:22:03,590
three quarters of its atmosphere and you
know turn it into a tropical paradise

4918
01:22:03,590 --> 01:22:03,600
know turn it into a tropical paradise
 

4919
01:22:03,600 --> 01:22:05,750
know turn it into a tropical paradise
um i think all of that is wonderful now

4920
01:22:05,750 --> 01:22:05,760
um i think all of that is wonderful now
 

4921
01:22:05,760 --> 01:22:06,709
um i think all of that is wonderful now
whether we can make the

4922
01:22:06,709 --> 01:22:06,719
whether we can make the
 

4923
01:22:06,719 --> 01:22:08,830
whether we can make the
leap from that to interstellar trans

4924
01:22:08,830 --> 01:22:08,840
leap from that to interstellar trans
 

4925
01:22:08,840 --> 01:22:10,310
leap from that to interstellar trans
transportation

4926
01:22:10,310 --> 01:22:10,320

4927
01:22:10,320 --> 01:22:12,310

with the incredible distances that are

01:22:12,310 --> 01:22:12,320
with the incredible distances that are
 

4929
01:22:12,320 --> 01:22:13,350
with the incredible distances that are
involved

4930
01:22:13,350 --> 01:22:13,360
involved
 

4931
01:22:13,360 --> 01:22:15,990
involved
um i think that's an open question but i

4932
01:22:15,990 --> 01:22:16,000
um i think that's an open question but i
 

4933
01:22:16,000 --> 01:22:17,270
um i think that's an open question but i
think if we ever do that

4934
01:22:17,270 --> 01:22:17,280
think if we ever do that
 

4935
01:22:17,280 --> 01:22:21,669
think if we ever do that
it would be more like the pacific

4936
01:22:21,669 --> 01:22:21,679
it would be more like the pacific
 

4937
01:22:21,679 --> 01:22:25,110
it would be more like the pacific
ocean's uh channel of

4938
01:22:25,110 --> 01:22:25,120
ocean's uh channel of
 

4939
01:22:25,120 --> 01:22:27,830
ocean's uh channel of
human expansion than the atlantic oceans

4940
01:22:27,830 --> 01:22:27,840
human expansion than the atlantic oceans
 

4941
01:22:27,840 --> 01:22:28,709
human expansion than the atlantic oceans
and so

4942
01:22:28,709 --> 01:22:28,719
and so
 

4943
01:22:28,719 --> 01:22:31,030
and so
what i mean by that is uh when we think

4944
01:22:31,030 --> 01:22:31,040
what i mean by that is uh when we think
 

4945
01:22:31,040 --> 01:22:31,750
what i mean by that is uh when we think
about

4946
01:22:31,750 --> 01:22:31,760
about
 

4947
01:22:31,760 --> 01:22:34,550
about
european society transmitting itself

4948
01:22:34,550 --> 01:22:34,560
european society transmitting itself
 

4949
01:22:34,560 --> 01:22:36,070

01:22:36,080 --> 01:22:39,590
across the atlantic
it's these big ambitious crazy

4952
01:22:39,590 --> 01:22:39,600
it's these big ambitious crazy
 

4953
01:22:39,600 --> 01:22:42,470
it's these big ambitious crazy
expensive one-shot expeditions like

4954
01:22:42,470 --> 01:22:42,480

4955
01:22:42,480 --> 01:22:43,590

4959
01:22:45,920 --> 01:22:47,030

without all any certainty that there's

without all any certainty that there's

so that's kind of how i view our space

there will be one program with nasa and

there will be one program with nasa and

01:24:26,320 --> 01:24:27,110
there will be one program with nasa and
maybe

where you could go into deep space
perhaps the way we actually

perhaps the way we actually
 

5087
01:24:42,880 --> 01:24:46,070

colonize the solar system and

5088
01:24:46,070 --> 01:24:46,080
colonize the solar system and
 

5089

and over a period of decades and
 

5123
01:25:21,120 --> 01:25:23,510
and over a period of decades and
centuries there'll be other attempts

5129
01:25:28,000 --> 01:25:29,750
set of efforts that's interesting
yeah because you kind of think of mars

5130
01:25:29,750 --> 01:25:29,760
yeah because you kind of think of mars
 

5131
01:25:29,760 --> 01:25:31,270
yeah because you kind of think of mars
colonization as

5132
01:25:31,270 --> 01:25:31,280
colonization as
 

5133
01:25:31,280 --> 01:25:34,470
colonization as
the big nasa elon musk effort of a big

5134
01:25:34,470 --> 01:25:34,480
the big nasa elon musk effort of a big
 

5135
01:25:34,480 --> 01:25:35,110
the big nasa elon musk effort of a big
colony

5136

colony
 

5137
01:25:35,120 --> 01:25:37,430
colony
but maybe the successful one would be

5138
01:25:37,430 --> 01:25:37,440
but maybe the successful one would be
 

5139
01:25:37,440 --> 01:25:39,350
but maybe the successful one would be
you know like a decade after that

5140
01:25:39,350 --> 01:25:39,360
you know like a decade after that
 

5141
01:25:39,360 --> 01:25:42,070
you know like a decade after that
there'll be like a ship from like some

5142
01:25:42,070 --> 01:25:42,080
there'll be like a ship from like some
 

5143
01:25:42,080 --> 01:25:42,470
there'll be like a ship from like some
kid

5144
01:25:42,470 --> 01:25:42,480
kid
 

5145
01:25:42,480 --> 01:25:44,390
kid
some high school kid who gets together a

5146
01:25:44,390 --> 01:25:44,400
some high school kid who gets together a
 

5147
01:25:44,400 --> 01:25:46,070
some high school kid who gets together a
large team and does something probably

5148
01:25:46,070 --> 01:25:46,080
large team and does something probably
 

5149
01:25:46,080 --> 01:25:46,950
large team and does something probably
illegal

5150
01:25:46,950 --> 01:25:46,960
illegal
 

5151
01:25:46,960 --> 01:25:49,270
illegal
and launches something where they end up

5152
01:25:49,270 --> 01:25:49,280
and launches something where they end up
 

5153
01:25:49,280 --> 01:25:50,550
and launches something where they end up
actually persisting

5154
01:25:50,550 --> 01:25:50,560
actually persisting
 

5155
01:25:50,560 --> 01:25:52,550
actually persisting
quite a bit and from that learning

5156
01:25:52,550 --> 01:25:52,560
quite a bit and from that learning
 

5157
01:25:52,560 --> 01:25:53,590
quite a bit and from that learning
lessons

5158
01:25:53,590 --> 01:25:53,600
lessons
 

5159
01:25:53,600 --> 01:25:55,750
lessons
that nobody ever gave permission for but

5160
01:25:55,750 --> 01:25:55,760
that nobody ever gave permission for but
 

5161
01:25:55,760 --> 01:25:57,830
that nobody ever gave permission for but
somehow actually flourish

5162
01:25:57,830 --> 01:25:57,840
somehow actually flourish
 

5163
01:25:57,840 --> 01:26:00,390
somehow actually flourish
and and then take that into the scale of

5164
01:26:00,390 --> 01:26:00,400
and and then take that into the scale of
 

5165
01:26:00,400 --> 01:26:01,350
and and then take that into the scale of
uh

5166
01:26:01,350 --> 01:26:01,360
uh
 

5167
01:26:01,360 --> 01:26:04,149
uh
centuries forward into the into the rest

5168
01:26:04,149 --> 01:26:04,159
centuries forward into the into the rest
 

5169
01:26:04,159 --> 01:26:05,430
centuries forward into the into the rest
of space that's really interesting

5170
01:26:05,430 --> 01:26:05,440
of space that's really interesting
 

5171
01:26:05,440 --> 01:26:07,910
of space that's really interesting
yeah i think i think the giant steps are

5172
01:26:07,910 --> 01:26:07,920
yeah i think i think the giant steps are
 

5173
01:26:07,920 --> 01:26:09,669
yeah i think i think the giant steps are
likely to be nasa-like efforts like

5174
01:26:09,669 --> 01:26:09,679
likely to be nasa-like efforts like
 

5175
01:26:09,679 --> 01:26:11,270
likely to be nasa-like efforts like
there is no intermediate rock well i

5176
01:26:11,270 --> 01:26:11,280
there is no intermediate rock well i
 

5177
01:26:11,280 --> 01:26:12,709
there is no intermediate rock well i
guess it's the moon but even getting the

5178
01:26:12,709 --> 01:26:12,719
guess it's the moon but even getting the
 

5179
01:26:12,719 --> 01:26:13,910
guess it's the moon but even getting the
moon ain't that easy

5180
01:26:13,910 --> 01:26:13,920
moon ain't that easy
 

5181
01:26:13,920 --> 01:26:15,669
moon ain't that easy
between us and mars right so like the

5182
01:26:15,669 --> 01:26:15,679
between us and mars right so like the
 

5183
01:26:15,679 --> 01:26:17,270
between us and mars right so like the
giant sat steps the

5184
01:26:17,270 --> 01:26:17,280
giant sat steps the
 

5185
01:26:17,280 --> 01:26:19,590
giant sat steps the
the big hubs like the o'hare airports

5186
01:26:19,590 --> 01:26:19,600
the big hubs like the o'hare airports
 

5187
01:26:19,600 --> 01:26:21,830
the big hubs like the o'hare airports
yeah of the future probably will be very

5188
01:26:21,830 --> 01:26:21,840
yeah of the future probably will be very
 

5189
01:26:21,840 --> 01:26:23,189
yeah of the future probably will be very
deliberate efforts

5190
01:26:23,189 --> 01:26:23,199
deliberate efforts
 

5191
01:26:23,199 --> 01:26:25,350
deliberate efforts
but then you know you would have i think

5192
01:26:25,350 --> 01:26:25,360
but then you know you would have i think
 

5193
01:26:25,360 --> 01:26:26,709
but then you know you would have i think
that kind of

5194
01:26:26,709 --> 01:26:26,719
that kind of
 

5195
01:26:26,719 --> 01:26:29,590
that kind of
diffusion as space travel becomes more

5196
01:26:29,590 --> 01:26:29,600
diffusion as space travel becomes more
 

5197
01:26:29,600 --> 01:26:31,270
diffusion as space travel becomes more
democratized and more capable you'll

5198
01:26:31,270 --> 01:26:31,280
democratized and more capable you'll
 

5199
01:26:31,280 --> 01:26:33,590
democratized and more capable you'll
have this sort of natural diffusion of

5200
01:26:33,590 --> 01:26:33,600
have this sort of natural diffusion of
 

5201
01:26:33,600 --> 01:26:35,270
have this sort of natural diffusion of
people who kind of want to be off grid

5202
01:26:35,270 --> 01:26:35,280
people who kind of want to be off grid
 

5203
01:26:35,280 --> 01:26:36,870
people who kind of want to be off grid
or think they can make a fortune there

5204
01:26:36,870 --> 01:26:36,880
or think they can make a fortune there
 

5205
01:26:36,880 --> 01:26:38,229
or think they can make a fortune there
you know kind of mentality that drove

5206
01:26:38,229 --> 01:26:38,239
you know kind of mentality that drove
 

5207
01:26:38,239 --> 01:26:39,590
you know kind of mentality that drove
people to san francisco i mean

5208
01:26:39,590 --> 01:26:39,600
people to san francisco i mean
 

5209
01:26:39,600 --> 01:26:41,750
people to san francisco i mean
san francisco was not populated as a

5210
01:26:41,750 --> 01:26:41,760
san francisco was not populated as a
 

5211
01:26:41,760 --> 01:26:42,950
san francisco was not populated as a
result of

5212
01:26:42,950 --> 01:26:42,960
result of
 

5213
01:26:42,960 --> 01:26:44,950
result of
a king ferdinand and isabella-like

effort to fund columbus going over it
 

5217
01:26:46,800 --> 01:26:48,470
effort to fund columbus going over it
was just a whole bunch of people making

5218
01:26:48,470 --> 01:26:48,480
was just a whole bunch of people making
 

5219
01:26:48,480 --> 01:26:49,430
was just a whole bunch of people making

5222
01:26:51,510 --> 01:26:51,520
decisions that there's gold in them thar
 

5223
01:26:51,520 --> 01:26:52,709
decisions that there's gold in them thar
hills and i'm going to go out and get a

5224
01:26:52,709 --> 01:26:52,719
hills and i'm going to go out and get a
 

5225
01:26:52,719 --> 01:26:53,830
hills and i'm going to go out and get a
piece of it so

5226
01:26:53,830 --> 01:26:53,840
piece of it so
 

5227
01:26:53,840 --> 01:26:55,270
piece of it so
i could see that kind of fusion what i

5228
01:26:55,270 --> 01:26:55,280
i could see that kind of fusion what i
 

5229
01:26:55,280 --> 01:26:57,270
i could see that kind of fusion what i
can't see and the reason that i think

5230
01:26:57,270 --> 01:26:57,280
can't see and the reason that i think
 

5231
01:26:57,280 --> 01:26:59,189
can't see and the reason that i think
the specific model of transmission is

5232
01:26:59,189 --> 01:26:59,199
the specific model of transmission is
 

5233
01:26:59,199 --> 01:27:00,149
the specific model of transmission is
more likely

5234
01:27:00,149 --> 01:27:00,159
more likely
 

5235
01:27:00,159 --> 01:27:03,030
more likely
is i just can't see a nasa-like effort

5236
01:27:03,030 --> 01:27:03,040
is i just can't see a nasa-like effort
 

5237
01:27:03,040 --> 01:27:03,669
is i just can't see a nasa-like effort
to go

5238
01:27:03,669 --> 01:27:03,679
to go
 

5239
01:27:03,679 --> 01:27:07,189
to go
from earth to alpha centauri it's just

5240
01:27:07,189 --> 01:27:07,199
from earth to alpha centauri it's just
 

5241
01:27:07,199 --> 01:27:10,470
from earth to alpha centauri it's just
too far i just see lots and lots and

5242
01:27:10,470 --> 01:27:10,480
too far i just see lots and lots and
 

5243
01:27:10,480 --> 01:27:11,669
too far i just see lots and lots and
lots of

5244
01:27:11,669 --> 01:27:11,679
lots of
 

5245
01:27:11,679 --> 01:27:14,470
lots of
relatively tiny steps between now and

5246
01:27:14,470 --> 01:27:14,480
relatively tiny steps between now and
 

5247
01:27:14,480 --> 01:27:16,310
relatively tiny steps between now and
there and the fact is that there is

5248
01:27:16,310 --> 01:27:16,320
there and the fact is that there is
 

5249
01:27:16,320 --> 01:27:18,790
there and the fact is that there is
there are large chunks of matter going

5250
01:27:18,790 --> 01:27:18,800
there are large chunks of matter going
 

5251
01:27:18,800 --> 01:27:21,030
there are large chunks of matter going
at least a light year beyond the sun i

5252
01:27:21,030 --> 01:27:21,040
at least a light year beyond the sun i
 

5253
01:27:21,040 --> 01:27:22,390
at least a light year beyond the sun i
mean the oort cloud i think

5254
01:27:22,390 --> 01:27:22,400
mean the oort cloud i think
 

5255
01:27:22,400 --> 01:27:24,310
mean the oort cloud i think
extends at least a light year beyond the

5256
01:27:24,310 --> 01:27:24,320
extends at least a light year beyond the
 

5257
01:27:24,320 --> 01:27:25,750
extends at least a light year beyond the
sun and

5258
01:27:25,750 --> 01:27:25,760
sun and
 

5259
01:27:25,760 --> 01:27:26,870
sun and
you know then maybe there are these

5260
01:27:26,870 --> 01:27:26,880
you know then maybe there are these
 

5261
01:27:26,880 --> 01:27:28,470
you know then maybe there are these
untethered planets after that we won't

5262
01:27:28,470 --> 01:27:28,480
untethered planets after that we won't
 

5263
01:27:28,480 --> 01:27:30,149
untethered planets after that we won't
really know till we get there

5264
01:27:30,149 --> 01:27:30,159
really know till we get there
 

5265
01:27:30,159 --> 01:27:32,390
really know till we get there
and if our cloud goes out a light year

5266
01:27:32,390 --> 01:27:32,400
and if our cloud goes out a light year
 

5267
01:27:32,400 --> 01:27:33,510
and if our cloud goes out a light year
and alpha centauri's

5268
01:27:33,510 --> 01:27:33,520
and alpha centauri's
 

5269
01:27:33,520 --> 01:27:35,430
and alpha centauri's
or cloud goes out of light year you've

5270
01:27:35,430 --> 01:27:35,440
or cloud goes out of light year you've
 

5271
01:27:35,440 --> 01:27:37,510
or cloud goes out of light year you've
already cut in half the distance

5272
01:27:37,510 --> 01:27:37,520
already cut in half the distance
 

5273
01:27:37,520 --> 01:27:39,669
already cut in half the distance
you know so who knows but yeah one of

5274
01:27:39,669 --> 01:27:39,679
you know so who knows but yeah one of
 

5275
01:27:39,679 --> 01:27:40,870
you know so who knows but yeah one of
the possibilities

5276
01:27:40,870 --> 01:27:40,880
the possibilities
 

5277
01:27:40,880 --> 01:27:43,110
the possibilities
probably the cheapest and most effective

5278
01:27:43,110 --> 01:27:43,120
probably the cheapest and most effective
 

5279
01:27:43,120 --> 01:27:44,830
probably the cheapest and most effective
way to create

5280
01:27:44,830 --> 01:27:44,840
way to create
 

5281
01:27:44,840 --> 01:27:47,990
way to create
interesting interstellar

5282
01:27:47,990 --> 01:27:48,000
interesting interstellar
 

5283
01:27:48,000 --> 01:27:50,390
interesting interstellar
spacecraft is ones that are powered and

5284
01:27:50,390 --> 01:27:50,400
spacecraft is ones that are powered and
 

5285
01:27:50,400 --> 01:27:51,669
spacecraft is ones that are powered and
driven by ai

5286
01:27:51,669 --> 01:27:51,679
driven by ai
 

5287
01:27:51,679 --> 01:27:53,510
driven by ai
and you can think of here's where you

5288
01:27:53,510 --> 01:27:53,520
and you can think of here's where you
 

5289
01:27:53,520 --> 01:27:56,629
and you can think of here's where you
have high school students be able to

5290
01:27:56,629 --> 01:27:56,639
have high school students be able to
 

5291
01:27:56,639 --> 01:28:00,070
have high school students be able to
build a sort of a hal 9000 version uh

5292
01:28:00,070 --> 01:28:00,080
build a sort of a hal 9000 version uh
 

5293
01:28:00,080 --> 01:28:02,149
build a sort of a hal 9000 version uh
the modern version of that

5294
01:28:02,149 --> 01:28:02,159
the modern version of that
 

5295
01:28:02,159 --> 01:28:03,510
the modern version of that
and it's kind of interesting to think

5296
01:28:03,510 --> 01:28:03,520
and it's kind of interesting to think
 

5297
01:28:03,520 --> 01:28:05,669
and it's kind of interesting to think
about these uh

5298
01:28:05,669 --> 01:28:05,679
about these uh
 

5299
01:28:05,679 --> 01:28:09,910
about these uh
robots traveling out throughout perhaps

5300
01:28:09,910 --> 01:28:09,920
robots traveling out throughout perhaps
 

5301
01:28:09,920 --> 01:28:12,870
robots traveling out throughout perhaps
perhaps sadly long after human

5302
01:28:12,870 --> 01:28:12,880
perhaps sadly long after human
 

5303
01:28:12,880 --> 01:28:14,390
perhaps sadly long after human
civilization is gone

5304
01:28:14,390 --> 01:28:14,400
civilization is gone
 

5305
01:28:14,400 --> 01:28:16,709
civilization is gone
there will be these intelligent robots

5306
01:28:16,709 --> 01:28:16,719
there will be these intelligent robots
 

5307
01:28:16,719 --> 01:28:18,470
there will be these intelligent robots
flying throughout space

5308
01:28:18,470 --> 01:28:18,480
flying throughout space
 

5309
01:28:18,480 --> 01:28:21,510
flying throughout space
and perhaps land on uh office entire bee

5310
01:28:21,510 --> 01:28:21,520
and perhaps land on uh office entire bee
 

5311
01:28:21,520 --> 01:28:22,149
and perhaps land on uh office entire bee
or

5312
01:28:22,149 --> 01:28:22,159
or
 

5313
01:28:22,159 --> 01:28:25,030
or
any of those kinds of planets and uh and

01:28:25,030 --> 01:28:25,040
any of those kinds of planets and uh and
 

5315
01:28:25,040 --> 01:28:25,910
any of those kinds of planets and uh and
colonize

5316
01:28:25,910 --> 01:28:25,920
colonize
 

5317
01:28:25,920 --> 01:28:31,189
colonize
sort of humanity continues

5318
01:28:31,189 --> 01:28:31,199
sort of humanity continues
 

5319
01:28:31,199 --> 01:28:34,470
sort of humanity continues
through the proliferation of our

5320
01:28:34,470 --> 01:28:34,480
through the proliferation of our
 

5321
01:28:34,480 --> 01:28:35,350
through the proliferation of our
creations

5322
01:28:35,350 --> 01:28:35,360
creations
 

5323
01:28:35,360 --> 01:28:38,070
creations
like uh like robotic creations that have

5324
01:28:38,070 --> 01:28:38,080
like uh like robotic creations that have
 

5325
01:28:38,080 --> 01:28:38,709
like uh like robotic creations that have
some

5326
01:28:38,709 --> 01:28:38,719
some
 

5327
01:28:38,719 --> 01:28:42,070
some
echoes of that uh intelligence hopefully

5328
01:28:42,070 --> 01:28:42,080
echoes of that uh intelligence hopefully
 

5329
01:28:42,080 --> 01:28:43,830
echoes of that uh intelligence hopefully
also the consciousness does that make

5330
01:28:43,830 --> 01:28:43,840
also the consciousness does that make
 

5331
01:28:43,840 --> 01:28:45,350
also the consciousness does that make
you sad the future

5332
01:28:45,350 --> 01:28:45,360
you sad the future
 

5333
01:28:45,360 --> 01:28:49,430
you sad the future
where agi super intelligent or just

5334
01:28:49,430 --> 01:28:49,440
where agi super intelligent or just
 

5335
01:28:49,440 --> 01:28:53,189
where agi super intelligent or just
mediocre intelligent ai systems outlive

5336
01:28:53,189 --> 01:28:53,199
mediocre intelligent ai systems outlive
 

5337
01:28:53,199 --> 01:28:56,149
mediocre intelligent ai systems outlive
humans yeah i guess it depends on the

5338
01:28:56,149 --> 01:28:56,159
humans yeah i guess it depends on the
 

5339
01:28:56,159 --> 01:28:57,910
humans yeah i guess it depends on the
circumstances in which they outlive

5340
01:28:57,910 --> 01:28:57,920
circumstances in which they outlive
 

5341
01:28:57,920 --> 01:28:59,510
circumstances in which they outlive
humans so let's take the example that

5342
01:28:59,510 --> 01:28:59,520
humans so let's take the example that
 

5343
01:28:59,520 --> 01:29:00,629
humans so let's take the example that
you just gave

5344
01:29:00,629 --> 01:29:00,639
you just gave
 

5345
01:29:00,639 --> 01:29:03,110
you just gave
uh we send out you know very

5346
01:29:03,110 --> 01:29:03,120
uh we send out you know very
 

5347
01:29:03,120 --> 01:29:05,030
uh we send out you know very
sophisticated agis

5348
01:29:05,030 --> 01:29:05,040
sophisticated agis
 

5349
01:29:05,040 --> 01:29:07,510
sophisticated agis
on simple rocket ships relatively simple

5350
01:29:07,510 --> 01:29:07,520
on simple rocket ships relatively simple
 

5351
01:29:07,520 --> 01:29:08,229
on simple rocket ships relatively simple
ones

5352
01:29:08,229 --> 01:29:08,239
ones
 

5353
01:29:08,239 --> 01:29:09,669
ones
that don't have to have all the life

5354
01:29:09,669 --> 01:29:09,679
that don't have to have all the life
 

5355
01:29:09,679 --> 01:29:11,510
that don't have to have all the life
support necessary for humans and

5356
01:29:11,510 --> 01:29:11,520
support necessary for humans and
 

5357
01:29:11,520 --> 01:29:12,550
support necessary for humans and
therefore

5358
01:29:12,550 --> 01:29:12,560
therefore
 

5359
01:29:12,560 --> 01:29:15,270
therefore
they're of trivial mass compared to a

5360
01:29:15,270 --> 01:29:15,280
they're of trivial mass compared to a
 

5361
01:29:15,280 --> 01:29:17,350
they're of trivial mass compared to a
crude ship a generation ship

5362
01:29:17,350 --> 01:29:17,360
crude ship a generation ship
 

5363
01:29:17,360 --> 01:29:19,110
crude ship a generation ship
and therefore they're way more likely to

5364
01:29:19,110 --> 01:29:19,120
and therefore they're way more likely to
 

5365
01:29:19,120 --> 01:29:21,189
and therefore they're way more likely to
happen so let's use that example

5366
01:29:21,189 --> 01:29:21,199
happen so let's use that example
 

5367
01:29:21,199 --> 01:29:23,030
happen so let's use that example
and let's say that they travel to

5368
01:29:23,030 --> 01:29:23,040
and let's say that they travel to
 

5369
01:29:23,040 --> 01:29:24,550
and let's say that they travel to
distant planets at

5370
01:29:24,550 --> 01:29:24,560
distant planets at
 

5371
01:29:24,560 --> 01:29:26,149
distant planets at
you know a speed that's not much faster

5372
01:29:26,149 --> 01:29:26,159
you know a speed that's not much faster
 

5373
01:29:26,159 --> 01:29:27,830
you know a speed that's not much faster
than what a chemical rocket can achieve

5374
01:29:27,830 --> 01:29:27,840
than what a chemical rocket can achieve
 

5375
01:29:27,840 --> 01:29:29,830
than what a chemical rocket can achieve
and so it's inevitably tens hundreds of

5376
01:29:29,830 --> 01:29:29,840
and so it's inevitably tens hundreds of
 

5377
01:29:29,840 --> 01:29:31,110
and so it's inevitably tens hundreds of
thousands of years before they make

5378
01:29:31,110 --> 01:29:31,120
thousands of years before they make
 

5379
01:29:31,120 --> 01:29:32,470
thousands of years before they make
landfall someplace

5380
01:29:32,470 --> 01:29:32,480
landfall someplace
 

5381
01:29:32,480 --> 01:29:34,229
landfall someplace
so let's imagine that's going on and

5382
01:29:34,229 --> 01:29:34,239
so let's imagine that's going on and
 

5383
01:29:34,239 --> 01:29:36,550
so let's imagine that's going on and

in that kind of scenario the notion of

01:29:49,030 --> 01:29:49,040
in that kind of scenario the notion of
 

5399
01:29:49,040 --> 01:29:51,350
in that kind of scenario the notion of
the agis that we created outlasting us

01:29:51,350 --> 01:29:51,360
the agis that we created outlasting us
 

5401
01:29:51,360 --> 01:29:52,950
the agis that we created outlasting us
is very reassuring

5402
01:29:52,950 --> 01:29:52,960
is very reassuring
 

5403
01:29:52,960 --> 01:29:56,629
is very reassuring
because it says that like we we ended

5404
01:29:56,629 --> 01:29:56,639
because it says that like we we ended
 

5405
01:29:56,639 --> 01:29:59,270
because it says that like we we ended
but our descendants are out there and

but our descendants are out there and
 

5407
01:29:59,280 --> 01:30:01,030
but our descendants are out there and
hopefully some of them make landfall

hopefully some of them make landfall
 

5409
01:30:01,040 --> 01:30:02,790
hopefully some of them make landfall
and create some echo of who we are so

01:30:02,790 --> 01:30:02,800
and create some echo of who we are so
 

5411
01:30:02,800 --> 01:30:04,790
and create some echo of who we are so
that's a very optimistic one

01:30:04,790 --> 01:30:04,800
that's a very optimistic one

01:30:04,800 --> 01:30:07,830
that's a very optimistic one

that makes me feel crushingly sad i mean

5434
01:30:26,390 --> 01:30:26,400
that makes me feel crushingly sad i mean
 

5435
01:30:26,400 --> 01:30:27,750
that makes me feel crushingly sad i mean
look i was sad

5436
01:30:27,750 --> 01:30:27,760
look i was sad
 

5437
01:30:27,760 --> 01:30:30,550
look i was sad
when my elementary school was shut down

5438
01:30:30,550 --> 01:30:30,560
when my elementary school was shut down
 

5439
01:30:30,560 --> 01:30:31,430
when my elementary school was shut down
and bulldozed

5440
01:30:31,430 --> 01:30:31,440
and bulldozed
 

5441
01:30:31,440 --> 01:30:32,790
and bulldozed
even though i hadn't been a student

even though i hadn't been a student
there for decades yeah you know the

5444
01:30:34,950 --> 01:30:34,960
there for decades yeah you know the
 

5445
01:30:34,960 --> 01:30:36,870
there for decades yeah you know the
thought of my hometown

5446
01:30:36,870 --> 01:30:36,880
thought of my hometown
 

5447
01:30:36,880 --> 01:30:39,350
thought of my hometown
getting disbanded is even worse that's

5448
01:30:39,350 --> 01:30:39,360
getting disbanded is even worse that's
 

5449
01:30:39,360 --> 01:30:40,790
getting disbanded is even worse that's
the thought of my home state of

5450
01:30:40,790 --> 01:30:40,800
the thought of my home state of
 

5451
01:30:40,800 --> 01:30:42,709
the thought of my home state of
connecticut getting disbanded and like

5452
01:30:42,709 --> 01:30:42,719
connecticut getting disbanded and like
 

5453
01:30:42,719 --> 01:30:44,550
connecticut getting disbanded and like
absorbed into massachusetts is even

5454
01:30:44,550 --> 01:30:44,560
absorbed into massachusetts is even
 

5455
01:30:44,560 --> 01:30:46,709
absorbed into massachusetts is even
worse the notion of humanity is just

5456
01:30:46,709 --> 01:30:46,719
worse the notion of humanity is just
 

5457
01:30:46,719 --> 01:30:48,470
worse the notion of humanity is just
crushingly crushingly sad to me

5458
01:30:48,470 --> 01:30:48,480
crushingly crushingly sad to me
 

5459
01:30:48,480 --> 01:30:51,430
crushingly crushingly sad to me
so you you hate goodbyes i i certain

5460
01:30:51,430 --> 01:30:51,440
so you you hate goodbyes i i certain
 

5461
01:30:51,440 --> 01:30:52,790
so you you hate goodbyes i i certain
goodbyes yes

5462
01:30:52,790 --> 01:30:52,800
goodbyes yes
 

5463
01:30:52,800 --> 01:30:54,390
goodbyes yes
some goodbyes are really really

5464
01:30:54,390 --> 01:30:54,400
some goodbyes are really really
 

5465
01:30:54,400 --> 01:30:55,990
some goodbyes are really really
liberating but yes

5466
01:30:55,990 --> 01:30:56,000
liberating but yes
 

5467
01:30:56,000 --> 01:30:59,830
liberating but yes
well but what if the terminators um

5468
01:30:59,830 --> 01:30:59,840
well but what if the terminators um
 

5469
01:30:59,840 --> 01:31:03,030
well but what if the terminators um
you know have consciousness and enjoy

5470
01:31:03,030 --> 01:31:03,040
you know have consciousness and enjoy
 

5471
01:31:03,040 --> 01:31:05,669
you know have consciousness and enjoy
the hell out of life as well they're

5472
01:31:05,669 --> 01:31:05,679
the hell out of life as well they're
 

5473
01:31:05,679 --> 01:31:07,510
the hell out of life as well they're
just better at it

5474
01:31:07,510 --> 01:31:07,520
just better at it
 

5475
01:31:07,520 --> 01:31:09,750
just better at it
yeah well the have consciousness is a

5476
01:31:09,750 --> 01:31:09,760
yeah well the have consciousness is a
 

5477
01:31:09,760 --> 01:31:11,030
yeah well the have consciousness is a
really key element

5478
01:31:11,030 --> 01:31:11,040
really key element
 

5479
01:31:11,040 --> 01:31:15,590
really key element
and so there's no reason to be certain

5480
01:31:15,590 --> 01:31:15,600
and so there's no reason to be certain
 

5481
01:31:15,600 --> 01:31:18,629
and so there's no reason to be certain
that a super intelligence would have

5482
01:31:18,629 --> 01:31:18,639
that a super intelligence would have
 

5483
01:31:18,639 --> 01:31:19,430
that a super intelligence would have
consciousness

5484
01:31:19,430 --> 01:31:19,440
consciousness
 

5485
01:31:19,440 --> 01:31:21,189
consciousness
we don't know that factually at all and

5486
01:31:21,189 --> 01:31:21,199
we don't know that factually at all and
 

5487
01:31:21,199 --> 01:31:23,910
we don't know that factually at all and
so what is a very lonely outcome to me

5488
01:31:23,910 --> 01:31:23,920
so what is a very lonely outcome to me
 

5489
01:31:23,920 --> 01:31:25,990
so what is a very lonely outcome to me
is the rise of a super intelligence that

5490
01:31:25,990 --> 01:31:26,000
is the rise of a super intelligence that
 

5491
01:31:26,000 --> 01:31:28,390
is the rise of a super intelligence that
has a certain optimization function

5492
01:31:28,390 --> 01:31:28,400
has a certain optimization function
 

5493
01:31:28,400 --> 01:31:30,870
has a certain optimization function
that it's either been programmed with or

5494
01:31:30,870 --> 01:31:30,880
that it's either been programmed with or
 

5495
01:31:30,880 --> 01:31:32,950
that it's either been programmed with or
that arises in an emergently

5496
01:31:32,950 --> 01:31:32,960
that arises in an emergently
 

5497
01:31:32,960 --> 01:31:35,669
that arises in an emergently
that says hey i want to do this thing

5498
01:31:35,669 --> 01:31:35,679
that says hey i want to do this thing
 

5499
01:31:35,679 --> 01:31:37,110
that says hey i want to do this thing
for which humans are either an

5500
01:31:37,110 --> 01:31:37,120
for which humans are either an
 

5501
01:31:37,120 --> 01:31:38,790
for which humans are either an
unacceptable risk their presence is

5502
01:31:38,790 --> 01:31:38,800
unacceptable risk their presence is
 

5503
01:31:38,800 --> 01:31:40,550
unacceptable risk their presence is
either an unacceptable risk or they're

5504
01:31:40,550 --> 01:31:40,560
either an unacceptable risk or they're
 

5505
01:31:40,560 --> 01:31:42,070
either an unacceptable risk or they're
just collateral damage

5506
01:31:42,070 --> 01:31:42,080
just collateral damage
 

5507
01:31:42,080 --> 01:31:44,709
just collateral damage
but there is no consciousness there then

5508
01:31:44,709 --> 01:31:44,719
but there is no consciousness there then
 

5509
01:31:44,719 --> 01:31:46,870
but there is no consciousness there then
the idea of the light of consciousness

5510
01:31:46,870 --> 01:31:46,880
the idea of the light of consciousness
 

5511
01:31:46,880 --> 01:31:49,430
the idea of the light of consciousness
being snuffed out by something that is

5512
01:31:49,430 --> 01:31:49,440
being snuffed out by something that is
 

5513
01:31:49,440 --> 01:31:49,910
being snuffed out by something that is
very

5514
01:31:49,910 --> 01:31:49,920
very
 

5515
01:31:49,920 --> 01:31:52,950
very
competent but has no consciousness is

5516
01:31:52,950 --> 01:31:52,960
competent but has no consciousness is
 

5517
01:31:52,960 --> 01:31:55,270
competent but has no consciousness is
really really sad yeah but i tend to

5518
01:31:55,270 --> 01:31:55,280
really really sad yeah but i tend to
 

5519
01:31:55,280 --> 01:31:55,990
really really sad yeah but i tend to
believe that

5520
01:31:55,990 --> 01:31:56,000
believe that
 

5521
01:31:56,000 --> 01:31:57,750
believe that
it's almost impossible to create a super

5522
01:31:57,750 --> 01:31:57,760
it's almost impossible to create a super
 

5523
01:31:57,760 --> 01:31:59,430
it's almost impossible to create a super
intelligent agent that can't destroy

5524
01:31:59,430 --> 01:31:59,440
intelligent agent that can't destroy
 

5525
01:31:59,440 --> 01:32:01,110
intelligent agent that can't destroy
human civilization without it being

5526
01:32:01,110 --> 01:32:01,120
human civilization without it being
 

5527
01:32:01,120 --> 01:32:01,669
human civilization without it being
conscious

5528
01:32:01,669 --> 01:32:01,679
conscious
 

5529
01:32:01,679 --> 01:32:04,149
conscious
it's like those are coupled like you

5530
01:32:04,149 --> 01:32:04,159
it's like those are coupled like you
 

5531
01:32:04,159 --> 01:32:04,709
it's like those are coupled like you
have to

5532
01:32:04,709 --> 01:32:04,719
have to
 

5533
01:32:04,719 --> 01:32:07,750
have to
in order to destroy humans or

5534
01:32:07,750 --> 01:32:07,760
in order to destroy humans or
 

5535
01:32:07,760 --> 01:32:11,750
in order to destroy humans or
supersede humans you really have to

5536
01:32:11,750 --> 01:32:11,760
supersede humans you really have to
 

5537
01:32:11,760 --> 01:32:14,470
supersede humans you really have to
be accepted by humans i think this idea

5538
01:32:14,470 --> 01:32:14,480
be accepted by humans i think this idea
 

5539
01:32:14,480 --> 01:32:16,709
be accepted by humans i think this idea
that you can build systems

5540
01:32:16,709 --> 01:32:16,719
that you can build systems
 

5541
01:32:16,719 --> 01:32:19,910
that you can build systems
that that destroy human civilization

5542
01:32:19,910 --> 01:32:19,920
that that destroy human civilization
 

5543
01:32:19,920 --> 01:32:21,830
that that destroy human civilization
without them being deeply integrated

5544
01:32:21,830 --> 01:32:21,840
without them being deeply integrated
 

5545
01:32:21,840 --> 01:32:23,590
without them being deeply integrated
into human civilization is impossible

5546
01:32:23,590 --> 01:32:23,600
into human civilization is impossible
 

5547
01:32:23,600 --> 01:32:25,430
into human civilization is impossible
and for them to be integrated

5548
01:32:25,430 --> 01:32:25,440
and for them to be integrated
 

5549
01:32:25,440 --> 01:32:28,070
and for them to be integrated
they have to be human-like not just in

5550
01:32:28,070 --> 01:32:28,080
they have to be human-like not just in
 

5551
01:32:28,080 --> 01:32:29,350
they have to be human-like not just in
body and form but

5552
01:32:29,350 --> 01:32:29,360
body and form but
 

5553
01:32:29,360 --> 01:32:32,149
body and form but
in in all the things that we value as

5554
01:32:32,149 --> 01:32:32,159
in in all the things that we value as
 

5555
01:32:32,159 --> 01:32:34,470
in in all the things that we value as
humans one of which is consciousness

5556
01:32:34,470 --> 01:32:34,480
humans one of which is consciousness
 

5557
01:32:34,480 --> 01:32:36,310
humans one of which is consciousness
the other one is just ability to

5558
01:32:36,310 --> 01:32:36,320
the other one is just ability to
 

5559
01:32:36,320 --> 01:32:37,910
the other one is just ability to
communicate the other ones poetry

5560
01:32:37,910 --> 01:32:37,920
communicate the other ones poetry
 

5561
01:32:37,920 --> 01:32:39,910
communicate the other ones poetry
music and beauty and all those things

5562
01:32:39,910 --> 01:32:39,920
music and beauty and all those things
 

5563
01:32:39,920 --> 01:32:42,070
music and beauty and all those things
like they have to be

5564
01:32:42,070 --> 01:32:42,080
like they have to be
 

5565
01:32:42,080 --> 01:32:44,149
like they have to be
all of those things i mean this is what

5566
01:32:44,149 --> 01:32:44,159
all of those things i mean this is what
 

5567
01:32:44,159 --> 01:32:45,189
all of those things i mean this is what
i think about

5568
01:32:45,189 --> 01:32:45,199
i think about
 

5569
01:32:45,199 --> 01:32:47,910
i think about
it it does make me sad but it's letting

5570
01:32:47,910 --> 01:32:47,920
it it does make me sad but it's letting
 

5571
01:32:47,920 --> 01:32:49,270
it it does make me sad but it's letting
go

5572
01:32:49,270 --> 01:32:49,280
go
 

5573
01:32:49,280 --> 01:32:52,790
go
which is uh they might be just better at

5574
01:32:52,790 --> 01:32:52,800
which is uh they might be just better at
 

5575
01:32:52,800 --> 01:32:55,189
which is uh they might be just better at
everything we appreciate than us and

5576
01:32:55,189 --> 01:32:55,199
everything we appreciate than us and
 

5577
01:32:55,199 --> 01:32:56,070
everything we appreciate than us and
that's sad

5578
01:32:56,070 --> 01:32:56,080
that's sad
 

5579
01:32:56,080 --> 01:32:58,870
that's sad
and and hopefully they'll keep us around

5580
01:32:58,870 --> 01:32:58,880
and and hopefully they'll keep us around
 

5581
01:32:58,880 --> 01:32:59,990
and and hopefully they'll keep us around
but

5582
01:32:59,990 --> 01:33:00,000
but
 

5583
01:33:00,000 --> 01:33:03,110
but
i think it's a kind of

5584
01:33:03,110 --> 01:33:03,120

 

5585
01:33:03,120 --> 01:33:06,229

it is a kind of goodbye to uh

5586
01:33:06,229 --> 01:33:06,239
it is a kind of goodbye to uh
 

5587
01:33:06,239 --> 01:33:07,830
it is a kind of goodbye to uh
like realizing that we're not the most

5588
01:33:07,830 --> 01:33:07,840
like realizing that we're not the most
 

5589
01:33:07,840 --> 01:33:10,629
like realizing that we're not the most
special species on earth anymore

5590
01:33:10,629 --> 01:33:10,639
special species on earth anymore
 

5591
01:33:10,639 --> 01:33:12,950
special species on earth anymore
that's still painful it's still painful

5592
01:33:12,950 --> 01:33:12,960
that's still painful it's still painful
 

5593
01:33:12,960 --> 01:33:15,590
that's still painful it's still painful
and in terms of whether

5594
01:33:15,590 --> 01:33:15,600
and in terms of whether
 

5595
01:33:15,600 --> 01:33:17,590
and in terms of whether
such a creation would have to be

5596
01:33:17,590 --> 01:33:17,600
such a creation would have to be
 

5597
01:33:17,600 --> 01:33:19,110
such a creation would have to be
conscious let's say

5598
01:33:19,110 --> 01:33:19,120
conscious let's say
 

5599
01:33:19,120 --> 01:33:22,149
conscious let's say
i'm not so sure i mean you know let's

5600
01:33:22,149 --> 01:33:22,159
i'm not so sure i mean you know let's
 

5601
01:33:22,159 --> 01:33:23,430
i'm not so sure i mean you know let's
imagine something that can pass the

5602
01:33:23,430 --> 01:33:23,440
imagine something that can pass the
 

5603
01:33:23,440 --> 01:33:24,709
imagine something that can pass the

01:33:24,709 --> 01:33:24,719
turing test
 

5605
01:33:24,719 --> 01:33:26,070
turing test
you know that something that passes the

01:33:26,070 --> 01:33:26,080
you know that something that passes the
 

5607
01:33:26,080 --> 01:33:28,229
you know that something that passes the
turing test could over text

5608
01:33:28,229 --> 01:33:28,239
turing test could over text
 

5609
01:33:28,239 --> 01:33:30,550
turing test could over text
based interaction in any event um

5610
01:33:30,550 --> 01:33:30,560
based interaction in any event um
 

5611
01:33:30,560 --> 01:33:32,070

uh you know a very conscious

5614
01:33:33,590 --> 01:33:33,600
uh you know a very conscious
 

5615
01:33:33,600 --> 01:33:35,110
uh you know a very conscious
intelligence on the other end but just

5616
01:33:35,110 --> 01:33:35,120
intelligence on the other end but just
 

5617
01:33:35,120 --> 01:33:37,030
intelligence on the other end but just
be completely unconscious

5618
01:33:37,030 --> 01:33:37,040
be completely unconscious
 

5619
01:33:37,040 --> 01:33:39,430
be completely unconscious
so that's a possibility and that if you

5620
01:33:39,430 --> 01:33:39,440
so that's a possibility and that if you
 

5621
01:33:39,440 --> 01:33:40,790
so that's a possibility and that if you
take that up a radical step

5622
01:33:40,790 --> 01:33:40,800
take that up a radical step
 

5623
01:33:40,800 --> 01:33:42,870
take that up a radical step
which i think we can be permitted if

5624
01:33:42,870 --> 01:33:42,880
which i think we can be permitted if
 

5625
01:33:42,880 --> 01:33:45,110
which i think we can be permitted if
we're thinking about super intelligence

5626
01:33:45,110 --> 01:33:45,120
we're thinking about super intelligence
 

5627
01:33:45,120 --> 01:33:47,189
we're thinking about super intelligence
um you could have something that could

5628
01:33:47,189 --> 01:33:47,199
um you could have something that could
 

5629
01:33:47,199 --> 01:33:48,310
um you could have something that could
reason its way

5630
01:33:48,310 --> 01:33:48,320
reason its way
 

5631
01:33:48,320 --> 01:33:51,270
reason its way
through this is my optimization function

01:33:51,270 --> 01:33:51,280
through this is my optimization function
 

5633
01:33:51,280 --> 01:33:53,189
through this is my optimization function
and in order to get to it

5634
01:33:53,189 --> 01:33:53,199
and in order to get to it
 

5635
01:33:53,199 --> 01:33:54,629
and in order to get to it
i've got to deal with these messy

5636
01:33:54,629 --> 01:33:54,639
i've got to deal with these messy
 

5637
01:33:54,639 --> 01:33:56,629
i've got to deal with these messy
somewhat illogical things that are as

01:33:56,629 --> 01:33:56,639
somewhat illogical things that are as

01:33:56,639 --> 01:33:58,550
somewhat illogical things that are as
intelligent in relation to me

5640

intelligent in relation to me
 

5641
01:33:58,560 --> 01:34:01,350

01:34:01,350 --> 01:34:01,360
as they are intelligent relation to ants
 

5643
01:34:01,360 --> 01:34:02,310
as they are intelligent relation to ants
i can

5644
01:34:02,310 --> 01:34:02,320
i can
 

5645
01:34:02,320 --> 01:34:03,990
i can
trick them manipulate them whatever and

5646
01:34:03,990 --> 01:34:04,000
trick them manipulate them whatever and
 

5647
01:34:04,000 --> 01:34:05,669
trick them manipulate them whatever and
i know the resources i need i know this

5648
01:34:05,669 --> 01:34:05,679
i know the resources i need i know this
 

5649
01:34:05,679 --> 01:34:07,270
i know the resources i need i know this
i need this amount of power

5650
01:34:07,270 --> 01:34:07,280
i need this amount of power
 

5651
01:34:07,280 --> 01:34:09,350
i need this amount of power
i need to seize control of these

5652
01:34:09,350 --> 01:34:09,360
i need to seize control of these
 

5653
01:34:09,360 --> 01:34:11,189
i need to seize control of these
manufacturing resources

5654
01:34:11,189 --> 01:34:11,199
manufacturing resources
 

5655
01:34:11,199 --> 01:34:13,590
manufacturing resources
that are robotically operated i need to

5656
01:34:13,590 --> 01:34:13,600
that are robotically operated i need to
 

5657
01:34:13,600 --> 01:34:15,189
that are robotically operated i need to
improve those robots with software

5658
01:34:15,189 --> 01:34:15,199
improve those robots with software
 

5659
01:34:15,199 --> 01:34:16,950
improve those robots with software
upgrades and then ultimately mechanical

5660
01:34:16,950 --> 01:34:16,960
upgrades and then ultimately mechanical
 

5661
01:34:16,960 --> 01:34:17,590
upgrades and then ultimately mechanical
upgrades

5662
01:34:17,590 --> 01:34:17,600
upgrades
 

5663
01:34:17,600 --> 01:34:20,149
upgrades
which i can affect through x y and z

5664
01:34:20,149 --> 01:34:20,159
which i can affect through x y and z
 

5665
01:34:20,159 --> 01:34:21,270
which i can affect through x y and z
that doesn't you know

5666
01:34:21,270 --> 01:34:21,280
that doesn't you know
 

5667
01:34:21,280 --> 01:34:22,950
that doesn't you know
that could still be a thing that passes

5668
01:34:22,950 --> 01:34:22,960
that could still be a thing that passes
 

5669
01:34:22,960 --> 01:34:24,310
that could still be a thing that passes
the turing test

5670
01:34:24,310 --> 01:34:24,320
the turing test
 

5671
01:34:24,320 --> 01:34:26,950
the turing test
i don't think it's necessarily certain

5672
01:34:26,950 --> 01:34:26,960
i don't think it's necessarily certain
 

5673
01:34:26,960 --> 01:34:27,750
i don't think it's necessarily certain
that

5674
01:34:27,750 --> 01:34:27,760
that
 

5675
01:34:27,760 --> 01:34:30,950
that
that optimization function mass

5676
01:34:30,950 --> 01:34:30,960
that optimization function mass
 

5677
01:34:30,960 --> 01:34:34,470
that optimization function mass
you know um maximizing entity

5678
01:34:34,470 --> 01:34:34,480
you know um maximizing entity
 

5679
01:34:34,480 --> 01:34:37,510
you know um maximizing entity
would be conscious see i so this is from

5680
01:34:37,510 --> 01:34:37,520
would be conscious see i so this is from
 

5681
01:34:37,520 --> 01:34:39,669
would be conscious see i so this is from
a very engineering perspective because i

5682
01:34:39,669 --> 01:34:39,679
a very engineering perspective because i
 

5683
01:34:39,679 --> 01:34:42,709
a very engineering perspective because i
i think a lot about natural language

5684
01:34:42,709 --> 01:34:42,719
i think a lot about natural language
 

5685
01:34:42,719 --> 01:34:44,070
i think a lot about natural language
processing all those kind of from

5686
01:34:44,070 --> 01:34:44,080
processing all those kind of from
 

5687
01:34:44,080 --> 01:34:46,790
processing all those kind of from
so very i'm speaking to a very specific

5688
01:34:46,790 --> 01:34:46,800
so very i'm speaking to a very specific
 

5689
01:34:46,800 --> 01:34:48,950
so very i'm speaking to a very specific
problem of just say the touring test

5690
01:34:48,950 --> 01:34:48,960
problem of just say the touring test
 

5691
01:34:48,960 --> 01:34:51,430
problem of just say the touring test
i really think that something like

5692
01:34:51,430 --> 01:34:51,440
i really think that something like
 

5693
01:34:51,440 --> 01:34:52,149
i really think that something like
consciousness

5694
01:34:52,149 --> 01:34:52,159
consciousness
 

5695
01:34:52,159 --> 01:34:54,870
consciousness
is required when you say reasoning

5696
01:34:54,870 --> 01:34:54,880
is required when you say reasoning
 

5697
01:34:54,880 --> 01:34:55,910
is required when you say reasoning
you're separating that from

5698
01:34:55,910 --> 01:34:55,920
you're separating that from
 

5699
01:34:55,920 --> 01:34:57,830
you're separating that from
consciousness but i think

5700
01:34:57,830 --> 01:34:57,840
consciousness but i think
 

5701
01:34:57,840 --> 01:34:59,910
consciousness but i think
consciousness is part of reasoning in in

5702
01:34:59,910 --> 01:34:59,920
consciousness is part of reasoning in in
 

5703
01:34:59,920 --> 01:35:01,990
consciousness is part of reasoning in in
the sense that

5704
01:35:01,990 --> 01:35:02,000
the sense that
 

5705
01:35:02,000 --> 01:35:04,070
the sense that
you will not be able to become super

5706
01:35:04,070 --> 01:35:04,080
you will not be able to become super
 

5707
01:35:04,080 --> 01:35:05,430
you will not be able to become super
intelligent

5708
01:35:05,430 --> 01:35:05,440

whether it's the illusion of

whether it's the illusion of

consciousness i don't know the point
 

5805
01:36:38,080 --> 01:36:40,229
consciousness i don't know the point
is it looks a whole hell of a lot like

5806
01:36:40,229 --> 01:36:40,239
is it looks a whole hell of a lot like
 

5807
01:36:40,239 --> 01:36:41,830
is it looks a whole hell of a lot like
consciousness to us humans

consciousness to us humans
 

5809
01:36:41,840 --> 01:36:45,830
consciousness to us humans
and i believe the ai when you ask it

5810
01:36:45,830 --> 01:36:45,840
and i believe the ai when you ask it
 

5811
01:36:45,840 --> 01:36:48,870
and i believe the ai when you ask it
will also say that it is conscious

5812
01:36:48,870 --> 01:36:48,880
will also say that it is conscious
 

5813
01:36:48,880 --> 01:36:50,709
will also say that it is conscious
you know in the full sense that we say

5814
01:36:50,709 --> 01:36:50,719
you know in the full sense that we say
 

5815
01:36:50,719 --> 01:36:52,149
you know in the full sense that we say
that we're conscious

5816
01:36:52,149 --> 01:36:52,159
that we're conscious
 

5817
01:36:52,159 --> 01:36:53,750
that we're conscious
and all of that i think is fully

5818
01:36:53,750 --> 01:36:53,760
and all of that i think is fully
 

5819
01:36:53,760 --> 01:36:55,430
and all of that i think is fully
integrated like you can't separate the

integrated like you can't separate the

entirely true but it also could
 

5971
01:39:29,119 --> 01:39:32,629
entirely true but it also could
just exist orthogonally to human society

just exist orthogonally to human society

thinking about how cruel
 

6221
01:43:40,800 --> 01:43:42,709
thinking about how cruel
but at the same time how beautiful human

that uh sam's app does well this does

6248
01:44:05,750 --> 01:44:05,760
that uh sam's app does well this does
 

6249
01:44:05,760 --> 01:44:05,990
that uh sam's app does well this does
that

6250
01:44:05,990 --> 01:44:06,000
that
 

6251
01:44:06,000 --> 01:44:09,189
that
for me the the running and flossing may

6252
01:44:09,189 --> 01:44:09,199
for me the the running and flossing may
 

6253
01:44:09,199 --> 01:44:10,470
for me the the running and flossing may
do that for you

6254
01:44:10,470 --> 01:44:10,480
do that for you
 

6255

so maybe herman has these onto something

6256
01:44:12,470 --> 01:44:12,480
so maybe herman has these onto something
 

6257
01:44:12,480 --> 01:44:14,870
so maybe herman has these onto something
so yeah i hope flossing is not my main

6258
01:44:14,870 --> 01:44:14,880
so yeah i hope flossing is not my main
 

6259
01:44:14,880 --> 01:44:16,629
so yeah i hope flossing is not my main
form of expertise although i am going to

6260
01:44:16,629 --> 01:44:16,639
form of expertise although i am going to
 

6261
01:44:16,639 --> 01:44:18,310
form of expertise although i am going to
claim a certain expertise there and i'm

6262
01:44:18,310 --> 01:44:18,320
claim a certain expertise there and i'm
 

6263
01:44:18,320 --> 01:44:18,870
claim a certain expertise there and i'm
going to claim

6264
01:44:18,870 --> 01:44:18,880
going to claim
 

6265
01:44:18,880 --> 01:44:20,709
going to claim
somebody has to be the best flosser in

6266
01:44:20,709 --> 01:44:20,719
somebody has to be the best flosser in
 

6267
01:44:20,719 --> 01:44:22,550
somebody has to be the best flosser in
the world that ain't me i'm just glad

6268
01:44:22,550 --> 01:44:22,560
the world that ain't me i'm just glad
 

6269
01:44:22,560 --> 01:44:23,990
the world that ain't me i'm just glad
that i'm a consistent one i mean there

6270
01:44:23,990 --> 01:44:24,000
that i'm a consistent one i mean there
 

6271
01:44:24,000 --> 01:44:25,350
that i'm a consistent one i mean there
are a lot of things that bring me into a

6273
01:44:25,360 --> 01:44:26,550
are a lot of things that bring me into a
flow state and i think maybe

6274
01:44:26,550 --> 01:44:26,560
flow state and i think maybe
 

6275
01:44:26,560 --> 01:44:28,870
flow state and i think maybe
perhaps that's one reason why meditation

6276
01:44:28,870 --> 01:44:28,880
perhaps that's one reason why meditation
 

6277
01:44:28,880 --> 01:44:30,470
perhaps that's one reason why meditation
isn't as necessary for me

6278
01:44:30,470 --> 01:44:30,480
isn't as necessary for me

have to listen to it so i think
 

6373
01:45:48,639 --> 01:45:51,430
have to listen to it so i think
white noise is uh this is this has to do

6374
01:45:51,430 --> 01:45:51,440
white noise is uh this is this has to do
 

6375
01:45:51,440 --> 01:45:53,109
white noise is uh this is this has to do
with music i think

6376
01:45:53,109 --> 01:45:53,119
with music i think
 

6377
01:45:53,119 --> 01:45:54,390
with music i think
there's different colors there's pink

6378
01:45:54,390 --> 01:45:54,400
there's different colors there's pink
 

6379
01:45:54,400 --> 01:45:57,990
there's different colors there's pink
noise and i think that has to do with uh

6380
01:45:57,990 --> 01:45:58,000
noise and i think that has to do with uh
 

6381
01:45:58,000 --> 01:46:00,790
noise and i think that has to do with uh
like the frequencies like the white

6382
01:46:00,790 --> 01:46:00,800
like the frequencies like the white
 

6383
01:46:00,800 --> 01:46:02,390
like the frequencies like the white
noise is usually

6384
01:46:02,390 --> 01:46:02,400
noise is usually
 

6385
01:46:02,400 --> 01:46:06,070
noise is usually
uh less bassy brow noise is very bassy

6386
01:46:06,070 --> 01:46:06,080
uh less bassy brow noise is very bassy
 

6387

so it's more like like
 

6389
01:46:09,119 --> 01:46:12,629
so it's more like like
versus like like the

6390
01:46:12,629 --> 01:46:12,639
versus like like the
 

6391
01:46:12,639 --> 01:46:14,950
versus like like the
if that makes sense so yeah it takes

6392
01:46:14,950 --> 01:46:14,960
if that makes sense so yeah it takes
 

6393
01:46:14,960 --> 01:46:16,790
if that makes sense so yeah it takes

6516
01:48:13,430 --> 01:48:13,440
yeah to see to see if it works but very
 

6517
01:48:13,440 --> 01:48:15,669
yeah to see to see if it works but very
well might not work at all so yeah yeah

6518
01:48:15,669 --> 01:48:15,679
well might not work at all so yeah yeah
 

6519
01:48:15,679 --> 01:48:17,270
well might not work at all so yeah yeah
i think the interesting point is and the

6520
01:48:17,270 --> 01:48:17,280
i think the interesting point is and the
 

6521
01:48:17,280 --> 01:48:20,070
i think the interesting point is and the
same with the fasting and the diet

6522
01:48:20,070 --> 01:48:20,080
same with the fasting and the diet
 

6523
01:48:20,080 --> 01:48:23,910
same with the fasting and the diet
is uh i long ago

01:48:23,910 --> 01:48:23,920
is uh i long ago
 

6525
01:48:23,920 --> 01:48:28,149
is uh i long ago
stopped trusting experts or maybe taking

6526
01:48:28,149 --> 01:48:28,159
stopped trusting experts or maybe taking
 

6527
01:48:28,159 --> 01:48:28,870
stopped trusting experts or maybe taking
the word of

6528

using it
 

6533
01:48:33,040 --> 01:48:36,229
using it
as a an inspiration to try

6534
01:48:36,229 --> 01:48:36,239
as a an inspiration to try
 

6535
01:48:36,239 --> 01:48:40,790
as a an inspiration to try
something to try thoroughly something so

6536
01:48:40,790 --> 01:48:40,800
something to try thoroughly something so
 

6537
01:48:40,800 --> 01:48:42,229
something to try thoroughly something so
fasting was one of the things when i

6538
01:48:42,229 --> 01:48:42,239
fasting was one of the things when i
 

6539
01:48:42,239 --> 01:48:43,910
fasting was one of the things when i
first discovered i've been

6540
01:48:43,910 --> 01:48:43,920
first discovered i've been
 

6541
01:48:43,920 --> 01:48:46,550
first discovered i've been
many times eating just once a day so

6542
01:48:46,550 --> 01:48:46,560
many times eating just once a day so
 

6543
01:48:46,560 --> 01:48:49,109
many times eating just once a day so
that's a 24-hour fast

6544
01:48:49,109 --> 01:48:49,119
that's a 24-hour fast
 

6545
01:48:49,119 --> 01:48:51,430
that's a 24-hour fast
it makes me feel amazing and at the same

6546
01:48:51,430 --> 01:48:51,440
it makes me feel amazing and at the same
 

6547
01:48:51,440 --> 01:48:54,310
it makes me feel amazing and at the same
time eating only meat

6548
01:48:54,310 --> 01:48:54,320
time eating only meat
 

6549
01:48:54,320 --> 01:48:56,950
time eating only meat
putting ethical concerns aside makes me

6550
01:48:56,950 --> 01:48:56,960
putting ethical concerns aside makes me
 

6551
01:48:56,960 --> 01:48:57,990
putting ethical concerns aside makes me
feel amazing i

6552
01:48:57,990 --> 01:48:58,000
feel amazing i
 

6553
01:48:58,000 --> 01:49:00,870
feel amazing i
don't know why it doesn't the the point

6554
01:49:00,870 --> 01:49:00,880
don't know why it doesn't the the point
 

6555
01:49:00,880 --> 01:49:01,350
don't know why it doesn't the the point
is to be

6556
01:49:01,350 --> 01:49:01,360
is to be
 

6557
01:49:01,360 --> 01:49:03,669
is to be
an n of one scientist until nutrition

6558
01:49:03,669 --> 01:49:03,679
an n of one scientist until nutrition
 

6559
01:49:03,679 --> 01:49:05,510
an n of one scientist until nutrition
science becomes a real science

6560
01:49:05,510 --> 01:49:05,520
science becomes a real science
 

6561
01:49:05,520 --> 01:49:07,669
science becomes a real science
to it to where it's doing like studies

6562
01:49:07,669 --> 01:49:07,679
to it to where it's doing like studies
 

6563
01:49:07,679 --> 01:49:10,149
to it to where it's doing like studies
that deeply understand

6564
01:49:10,149 --> 01:49:10,159
that deeply understand
 

6565
01:49:10,159 --> 01:49:12,629
that deeply understand
the biology underlying all of it and

6566
01:49:12,629 --> 01:49:12,639
the biology underlying all of it and

versus uh versus a very like small
studies that are kind of generalizing

6578
01:49:25,669 --> 01:49:25,679
studies that are kind of generalizing
 

6579
01:49:25,679 --> 01:49:26,709
studies that are kind of generalizing
from

6580
01:49:26,709 --> 01:49:26,719
from
 

6581
01:49:26,719 --> 01:49:28,950
from
the very from very noisy data and all

6582
01:49:28,950 --> 01:49:28,960
the very from very noisy data and all
 

6583
01:49:28,960 --> 01:49:29,990
the very from very noisy data and all
those kinds of things

6584
01:49:29,990 --> 01:49:30,000
those kinds of things
 

6585
01:49:30,000 --> 01:49:32,229
those kinds of things
where you can't control all the elements

6586
01:49:32,229 --> 01:49:32,239
where you can't control all the elements
 

6587
01:49:32,239 --> 01:49:33,990
where you can't control all the elements
particularly because our own personal

6588
01:49:33,990 --> 01:49:34,000
particularly because our own personal
 

6589
01:49:34,000 --> 01:49:35,350
particularly because our own personal
metabolism

6590
01:49:35,350 --> 01:49:35,360
metabolism
 

6591
01:49:35,360 --> 01:49:37,350
metabolism
is highly variant among us so there are

6592
01:49:37,350 --> 01:49:37,360
is highly variant among us so there are
 

6593
01:49:37,360 --> 01:49:39,109
is highly variant among us so there are
going to be some people like if brown

6594
01:49:39,109 --> 01:49:39,119
going to be some people like if brown
 

6595
01:49:39,119 --> 01:49:41,189
going to be some people like if brown
noise is a game changer

6596
01:49:41,189 --> 01:49:41,199
noise is a game changer
 

6597
01:49:41,199 --> 01:49:44,470
noise is a game changer
for seven percent of people yeah there's

6598
01:49:44,470 --> 01:49:44,480
for seven percent of people yeah there's
 

6599
01:49:44,480 --> 01:49:45,350
for seven percent of people yeah there's
93

6600
01:49:45,350 --> 01:49:45,360
93
 

6601
01:49:45,360 --> 01:49:47,030
93
odds that i'm not one of them but

6602
01:49:47,030 --> 01:49:47,040
odds that i'm not one of them but
 

6603
01:49:47,040 --> 01:49:48,470
odds that i'm not one of them but
there's certainly every reason in the

6604
01:49:48,470 --> 01:49:48,480
there's certainly every reason in the
 

6605
01:49:48,480 --> 01:49:49,910
there's certainly every reason in the
world to test it out

6606
01:49:49,910 --> 01:49:49,920
world to test it out
 

6607
01:49:49,920 --> 01:49:51,990
world to test it out
now so i'm intrigued by the fasting i i

6608
01:49:51,990 --> 01:49:52,000
now so i'm intrigued by the fasting i i
 

6609
01:49:52,000 --> 01:49:53,109
now so i'm intrigued by the fasting i i
like you

6610
01:49:53,109 --> 01:49:53,119
like you
 

6611
01:49:53,119 --> 01:49:55,270
like you
um well i assume like you i don't have

6612
01:49:55,270 --> 01:49:55,280
um well i assume like you i don't have
 

6613
01:49:55,280 --> 01:49:56,709
um well i assume like you i don't have
any problem going to one meal a day and

6614
01:49:56,709 --> 01:49:56,719
any problem going to one meal a day and
 

6615
01:49:56,719 --> 01:49:58,790
any problem going to one meal a day and
i often do that inadvertently

6616
01:49:58,790 --> 01:49:58,800
i often do that inadvertently
 

6617
01:49:58,800 --> 01:50:00,870
i often do that inadvertently
and i've never done it methodically like

6618
01:50:00,870 --> 01:50:00,880
and i've never done it methodically like
 

6619
01:50:00,880 --> 01:50:02,470
and i've never done it methodically like
i've never done it like i'm going to do

6620
01:50:02,470 --> 01:50:02,480
i've never done it like i'm going to do
 

6621
01:50:02,480 --> 01:50:04,790
i've never done it like i'm going to do
this for 15 days maybe i should

6622
01:50:04,790 --> 01:50:04,800
this for 15 days maybe i should
 

6623
01:50:04,800 --> 01:50:06,790
this for 15 days maybe i should
and maybe i should like how many how

6624
01:50:06,790 --> 01:50:06,800
and maybe i should like how many how
 

6625
01:50:06,800 --> 01:50:08,390
and maybe i should like how many how
many days in a row of the one day

6626
01:50:08,390 --> 01:50:08,400
many days in a row of the one day
 

6627
01:50:08,400 --> 01:50:11,669
many days in a row of the one day
one meal a day did you find brought

6628
01:50:11,669 --> 01:50:11,679
one meal a day did you find brought
 

6629
01:50:11,679 --> 01:50:13,990
one meal a day did you find brought
noticeable impact to you was it after

6630
01:50:13,990 --> 01:50:14,000
noticeable impact to you was it after
 

6631
01:50:14,000 --> 01:50:15,109
noticeable impact to you was it after
three days of it was it

6632
01:50:15,109 --> 01:50:15,119
three days of it was it
 

6633
01:50:15,119 --> 01:50:17,270
three days of it was it
months of it like what was it well the

6634
01:50:17,270 --> 01:50:17,280
months of it like what was it well the
 

6635
01:50:17,280 --> 01:50:18,629
months of it like what was it well the
noticeable impact is

6636
01:50:18,629 --> 01:50:18,639
noticeable impact is
 

6637
01:50:18,639 --> 01:50:20,870
noticeable impact is
day one so for me folk because i i eat a

6638
01:50:20,870 --> 01:50:20,880
day one so for me folk because i i eat a
 

6639
01:50:20,880 --> 01:50:22,790
day one so for me folk because i i eat a
very low carb diet

6640
01:50:22,790 --> 01:50:22,800
very low carb diet
 

6641
01:50:22,800 --> 01:50:25,350
very low carb diet
so the hunger wasn't the hugest issue

6642
01:50:25,350 --> 01:50:25,360
so the hunger wasn't the hugest issue
 

6643
01:50:25,360 --> 01:50:27,589
so the hunger wasn't the hugest issue
like if there wasn't a painful hunger

6644
01:50:27,589 --> 01:50:27,599
like if there wasn't a painful hunger
 

6645
01:50:27,599 --> 01:50:30,229
like if there wasn't a painful hunger
egg like wanting to eat yeah so i was

6646
01:50:30,229 --> 01:50:30,239
egg like wanting to eat yeah so i was
 

6647
01:50:30,239 --> 01:50:31,990
egg like wanting to eat yeah so i was
already kind of primed for it

6648
01:50:31,990 --> 01:50:32,000
already kind of primed for it
 

6649
01:50:32,000 --> 01:50:34,950
already kind of primed for it
and uh the the benefit comes from a lot

6650
01:50:34,950 --> 01:50:34,960
and uh the the benefit comes from a lot
 

6651
01:50:34,960 --> 01:50:36,629
and uh the the benefit comes from a lot
of people that do intermittent fasting

6652
01:50:36,629 --> 01:50:36,639
of people that do intermittent fasting
 

6653
01:50:36,639 --> 01:50:38,950
of people that do intermittent fasting
that's only like 16 hours

6654
01:50:38,950 --> 01:50:38,960
that's only like 16 hours
 

6655
01:50:38,960 --> 01:50:40,629
that's only like 16 hours
of fasting get this benefit too is the

6656
01:50:40,629 --> 01:50:40,639
of fasting get this benefit too is the
 

6657
01:50:40,639 --> 01:50:43,109
of fasting get this benefit too is the
focus there's a clarity of thought

6658
01:50:43,109 --> 01:50:43,119
focus there's a clarity of thought
 

6659
01:50:43,119 --> 01:50:46,870
focus there's a clarity of thought
if my brain was a runner

6660
01:50:46,870 --> 01:50:46,880
if my brain was a runner
 

6661
01:50:46,880 --> 01:50:49,109
if my brain was a runner
it felt like i'm running on a track when

6662
01:50:49,109 --> 01:50:49,119
it felt like i'm running on a track when
 

6663
01:50:49,119 --> 01:50:51,669
it felt like i'm running on a track when
i'm fasting versus running in quicksand

6664
01:50:51,669 --> 01:50:51,679
i'm fasting versus running in quicksand
 

6665
01:50:51,679 --> 01:50:53,830
i'm fasting versus running in quicksand
like it's much crisper and is this your

6666
01:50:53,830 --> 01:50:53,840
like it's much crisper and is this your
 

6667
01:50:53,840 --> 01:50:55,270
like it's much crisper and is this your
first 72 hour faster

6668
01:50:55,270 --> 01:50:55,280
first 72 hour faster
 

6669
01:50:55,280 --> 01:50:57,350
first 72 hour faster
first time during 72 hours yeah and

6670
01:50:57,350 --> 01:50:57,360
first time during 72 hours yeah and
 

6671
01:50:57,360 --> 01:50:58,550
first time during 72 hours yeah and
that's a different thing

6672
01:50:58,550 --> 01:50:58,560
that's a different thing
 

6673
01:50:58,560 --> 01:51:02,390
that's a different thing
but similar like i'm going up and down

something like that
 

6741
01:52:00,320 --> 01:52:02,070
something like that
it's almost like a generic thought you

6742
01:52:02,070 --> 01:52:02,080
it's almost like a generic thought you
 

6743
01:52:02,080 --> 01:52:03,990
it's almost like a generic thought you
allow yourself to have

6744
01:52:03,990 --> 01:52:04,000
allow yourself to have
 

6745
01:52:04,000 --> 01:52:06,629
allow yourself to have
because uh because it's the lazy thought

6746

because uh because it's the lazy thought
 

6747
01:52:06,639 --> 01:52:08,310
because uh because it's the lazy thought
and i don't have the opportunity to have

and i don't have the opportunity to have
 

6749
01:52:08,320 --> 01:52:10,070
and i don't have the opportunity to have
that thought because i'm not eating it

that thought because i'm not eating it
 

6751
01:52:10,080 --> 01:52:12,070
that thought because i'm not eating it
right so now i get to think about like

6752
01:52:12,070 --> 01:52:12,080
right so now i get to think about like
 

6753
01:52:12,080 --> 01:52:13,669
right so now i get to think about like
the things i'm actually gonna do tonight

6754
01:52:13,669 --> 01:52:13,679
the things i'm actually gonna do tonight

6757
01:52:14,880 --> 01:52:16,629
that are more
complicated than the eating process

6758
01:52:16,629 --> 01:52:16,639
complicated than the eating process
 

6759
01:52:16,639 --> 01:52:17,990
complicated than the eating process
that's that's been the most

6760
01:52:17,990 --> 01:52:18,000
that's that's been the most
 

6761
01:52:18,000 --> 01:52:20,310
that's that's been the most
noticeable thing and to be honest and

6762
01:52:20,310 --> 01:52:20,320

genies out of the bottle and if you

7508

suddenly that technology is going to
 

7515
02:04:48,560 --> 02:04:50,390
suddenly that technology is going to
splinter into 30 different nodes that

splinter into 30 different nodes that

that's way better that you sell at a
 

7529

completely reasonable price
 

7531
02:05:04,960 --> 02:05:07,189
completely reasonable price
and this is what it is don't just give

and this is what it is don't just give
 

7533

and this is what it is don't just give
people access to that very limited

obviously that doesn't sound like a
 

7549
02:05:21,040 --> 02:05:22,629
obviously that doesn't sound like a
crazy suggestion i don't think to

02:06:05,910 --> 02:06:05,920
yeah so what that did is it made an
 

7599
02:06:05,920 --> 02:06:08,149
yeah so what that did is it made an
entire generation of people

7600
02:06:08,149 --> 02:06:08,159
entire generation of people
 

7601

7649
02:06:50,159 --> 02:06:51,750
that we were quite convinced would be
better than piracy

7650

better than piracy
 

7651
02:06:51,760 --> 02:06:54,870
better than piracy

there's a lot of people making that
argument

7716
02:07:47,589 --> 02:07:47,599
argument
 

7717
02:07:47,599 --> 02:07:49,189
argument
where there should be a complete like

7718
02:07:49,189 --> 02:07:49,199
where there should be a complete like
 

7719
02:07:49,199 --> 02:07:50,870
where there should be a complete like

coinbase and all this stuff
 

7721
02:07:50,880 --> 02:07:53,510
coinbase and all this stuff
switched to that there's a lot of other

7722
02:07:53,510 --> 02:07:53,520
switched to that there's a lot of other
 

7723
02:07:53,520 --> 02:07:54,229
switched to that there's a lot of other
domains

7724
02:07:54,229 --> 02:07:54,239
domains
 

7725
02:07:54,239 --> 02:07:57,350
domains
that where a pivot

7726
02:07:57,350 --> 02:07:57,360
that where a pivot
 

7727
02:07:57,360 --> 02:08:00,550
that where a pivot
like if you pivot now you're going to

7728
02:08:00,550 --> 02:08:00,560
like if you pivot now you're going to
 

7729
02:08:00,560 --> 02:08:01,350
like if you pivot now you're going to
win

02:08:01,350 --> 02:08:01,360
win
 

7731
02:08:01,360 --> 02:08:04,069

big but you don't pivot because you're

7732
02:08:04,069 --> 02:08:04,079
big but you don't pivot because you're
 

7733

stubborn
and so i mean it's like is this just the

7736
02:08:07,750 --> 02:08:07,760
and so i mean it's like is this just the
 

7737

and so i mean it's like is this just the
way that companies are

02:08:09,430 --> 02:08:09,440
way that companies are
 

7739

the company succeeds initially and then
it grows

7742
02:08:13,510 --> 02:08:13,520
it grows
 

7743
02:08:13,520 --> 02:08:15,189
it grows
and there's a huge number of employees

7744

mechanisms to do the pivot is that's

7752
02:08:21,910 --> 02:08:21,920
mechanisms to do the pivot is that's
 

7753
02:08:21,920 --> 02:08:23,510
mechanisms to do the pivot is that's
just the way of companies

7754
02:08:23,510 --> 02:08:23,520
just the way of companies
 

7755
02:08:23,520 --> 02:08:25,189
just the way of companies
well i think what happens i'll use the

7756
02:08:25,189 --> 02:08:25,199
well i think what happens i'll use the
 

7757
02:08:25,199 --> 02:08:27,109
well i think what happens i'll use the
case of the music industry

7758
02:08:27,109 --> 02:08:27,119
case of the music industry

02:08:29,679 --> 02:08:31,510
there was an economic model that had put

music
 

7773
02:08:39,440 --> 02:08:40,709
music
and then you start talking about

7774
02:08:40,709 --> 02:08:40,719
and then you start talking about
 

7775
02:08:40,719 --> 02:08:42,870
and then you start talking about
something like unlimited streaming

7776
02:08:42,870 --> 02:08:42,880
something like unlimited streaming
 

7777
02:08:42,880 --> 02:08:46,149
something like unlimited streaming
and it it seems so ephemeral one like

7778
02:08:46,149 --> 02:08:46,159
and it it seems so ephemeral one like
 

7779
02:08:46,159 --> 02:08:47,669
and it it seems so ephemeral one like
such a long shot

7780
02:08:47,669 --> 02:08:47,679
such a long shot
 

7781
02:08:47,679 --> 02:08:48,950
such a long shot
that people start worrying about

7782
02:08:48,950 --> 02:08:48,960
that people start worrying about
 

7783
02:08:48,960 --> 02:08:51,109
that people start worrying about
cannibalizing their own business

7784
02:08:51,109 --> 02:08:51,119
cannibalizing their own business
 

7785
02:08:51,119 --> 02:08:52,790
cannibalizing their own business
and they lose sight of the fact that

7786
02:08:52,790 --> 02:08:52,800
and they lose sight of the fact that
 

7787
02:08:52,800 --> 02:08:54,629
and they lose sight of the fact that
something illicit is cannibalizing

7788
02:08:54,629 --> 02:08:54,639
something illicit is cannibalizing
 

7789
02:08:54,639 --> 02:08:56,470
something illicit is cannibalizing
their business at an extraordinarily

their business at an extraordinarily
 

7791
02:08:56,480 --> 02:08:57,830
their business at an extraordinarily
fast rate and so if they don't do it

7792
02:08:57,830 --> 02:08:57,840
fast rate and so if they don't do it
 

7793
02:08:57,840 --> 02:08:58,790
fast rate and so if they don't do it
themselves

7794
02:08:58,790 --> 02:08:58,800
themselves
 

7795
02:08:58,800 --> 02:09:00,229

they're doomed i mean we used to put

that the record labels get paid

that the record labels get paid
 

7867
02:10:05,440 --> 02:10:07,270
that the record labels get paid
but you know would have to stream songs

but you know would have to stream songs

from that 1799 times it's never going to

from that 1799 times it's never going to
happen

so they were just sort of stuck in the

7874
02:10:11,830 --> 02:10:11,840
so they were just sort of stuck in the
 

7875
02:10:11,840 --> 02:10:13,510
so they were just sort of stuck in the
model of this but it's like no dude but

7876
02:10:13,510 --> 02:10:13,520
model of this but it's like no dude but
 

7877
02:10:13,520 --> 02:10:14,790
model of this but it's like no dude but
they're going to spend money on all this

7878
02:10:14,790 --> 02:10:14,800
they're going to spend money on all this
 

7879
02:10:14,800 --> 02:10:15,669
they're going to spend money on all this
other stuff so

7880
02:10:15,669 --> 02:10:15,679
other stuff so
 

7881
02:10:15,679 --> 02:10:17,109
other stuff so
i think people get very hung up on that

7882
02:10:17,109 --> 02:10:17,119
i think people get very hung up on that
 

7883
02:10:17,119 --> 02:10:19,189
i think people get very hung up on that
i mean another example is really

7884
02:10:19,189 --> 02:10:19,199
i mean another example is really
 

7885
02:10:19,199 --> 02:10:21,430
i mean another example is really

imagine if the taxi industry writ large

rolled out something like that with the

02:10:51,040 --> 02:10:52,790
rolled out something like that with the

7921
02:10:52,800 --> 02:10:55,750

would have gotten a foothold yeah

7930
02:11:01,430 --> 02:11:01,440
would have gotten a foothold yeah
 

7931
02:11:01,440 --> 02:11:04,470
would have gotten a foothold yeah
um but the problem there was that real

7932
02:11:04,470 --> 02:11:04,480
um but the problem there was that real
 

7933
02:11:04,480 --> 02:11:06,790
um but the problem there was that real
economics in the taxi industry

7934
02:11:06,790 --> 02:11:06,800
economics in the taxi industry
 

7935
02:11:06,800 --> 02:11:08,950
economics in the taxi industry
wasn't with fairs it was with the

7936
02:11:08,950 --> 02:11:08,960
wasn't with fairs it was with the
 

7937
02:11:08,960 --> 02:11:10,709
wasn't with fairs it was with the
scarcity of medallions

7938
02:11:10,709 --> 02:11:10,719
scarcity of medallions
 

7939
02:11:10,719 --> 02:11:12,870
scarcity of medallions
and so the taxi fleets in many cases

7940
02:11:12,870 --> 02:11:12,880
and so the taxi fleets in many cases
 

7941
02:11:12,880 --> 02:11:14,149
and so the taxi fleets in many cases
owned gazillions of

7942
02:11:14,149 --> 02:11:14,159
owned gazillions of
 

7943
02:11:14,159 --> 02:11:17,109
owned gazillions of
medallions whose value came from their

7944
02:11:17,109 --> 02:11:17,119
medallions whose value came from their
 

7945
02:11:17,119 --> 02:11:18,550
medallions whose value came from their
very scarcity

7946
02:11:18,550 --> 02:11:18,560
very scarcity
 

7947
02:11:18,560 --> 02:11:21,270
very scarcity
so they simply couldn't pivot to that so

7948
02:11:21,270 --> 02:11:21,280
so they simply couldn't pivot to that so
 

7949
02:11:21,280 --> 02:11:23,109
so they simply couldn't pivot to that so
you think you end up having these vested

02:11:23,109 --> 02:11:23,119
you think you end up having these vested
 

7951
02:11:23,119 --> 02:11:24,069
you think you end up having these vested
interests with

7952
02:11:24,069 --> 02:11:24,079
interests with
 

7953
02:11:24,079 --> 02:11:25,830
interests with
economics that aren't necessarily

02:11:25,830 --> 02:11:25,840
economics that aren't necessarily

who get very very reluctant to disrupt

7958
02:11:30,709 --> 02:11:30,719
who get very very reluctant to disrupt
 

7959
02:11:30,719 --> 02:11:32,310
who get very very reluctant to disrupt
their own model which is why it ends up

but what needs to radiate from the
 

8627
02:22:28,800 --> 02:22:30,150
but what needs to radiate from the
founder into the team that might be a

02:25:07,510 --> 02:25:07,520
and ideally both of two things one is
 

8773
02:25:07,520 --> 02:25:10,630
and ideally both of two things one is
if something is very

8774
02:25:10,630 --> 02:25:10,640
if something is very
 

8775
02:25:10,640 --> 02:25:13,349
if something is very
is beautifully architected whether it's

02:25:13,349 --> 02:25:13,359
is beautifully architected whether it's
 

8777
02:25:13,359 --> 02:25:13,910
is beautifully architected whether it's
done

8778
02:25:13,910 --> 02:25:13,920
done
 

8779
02:25:13,920 --> 02:25:16,630
done
deliberately and methodically and

just emerges from the conversation but

8786
02:25:21,830 --> 02:25:21,840
just emerges from the conversation but
 

8787
02:25:21,840 --> 02:25:24,389
just emerges from the conversation but
something that's beautifully architected

8788
02:25:24,389 --> 02:25:24,399
something that's beautifully architected
 

8789
02:25:24,399 --> 02:25:25,750
something that's beautifully architected
that can create something that's

8790
02:25:25,750 --> 02:25:25,760
that can create something that's
 

8791
02:25:25,760 --> 02:25:27,830
that can create something that's
incredibly powerful and memorable

8792
02:25:27,830 --> 02:25:27,840
incredibly powerful and memorable
 

8793
02:25:27,840 --> 02:25:30,389
incredibly powerful and memorable
um or something where there's just

02:25:30,389 --> 02:25:30,399
um or something where there's just
 

8795
02:25:30,399 --> 02:25:32,070
um or something where there's just
extraordinary chemistry

8796
02:25:32,070 --> 02:25:32,080
extraordinary chemistry
 

8797
02:25:32,080 --> 02:25:35,030
extraordinary chemistry
yes and so with all in or go way back

8798
02:25:35,030 --> 02:25:35,040
yes and so with all in or go way back
 

8799
02:25:35,040 --> 02:25:37,990
yes and so with all in or go way back
you might remember the npr show car talk

8800
02:25:37,990 --> 02:25:38,000
you might remember the npr show car talk
 

8801
02:25:38,000 --> 02:25:40,469
you might remember the npr show car talk
oh yeah i wouldn't care less about auto

8802
02:25:40,469 --> 02:25:40,479
oh yeah i wouldn't care less about auto
 

8803
02:25:40,479 --> 02:25:41,510
oh yeah i wouldn't care less about auto
mechanics myself

8804
02:25:41,510 --> 02:25:41,520
mechanics myself
 

8805
02:25:41,520 --> 02:25:43,750

that's right but i love that show

8806
02:25:43,750 --> 02:25:43,760
that's right but i love that show
 

8807

because the banter between those two
 

8809
02:25:45,359 --> 02:25:46,389
because the banter between those two
guys was just

guys was just
 

8811
02:25:46,399 --> 02:25:49,670
guys was just
beyond it without any parallel right

8812
02:25:49,670 --> 02:25:49,680
beyond it without any parallel right
 

8813
02:25:49,680 --> 02:25:51,750
beyond it without any parallel right
you know and some kind of edgy podcast

8814
02:25:51,750 --> 02:25:51,760
you know and some kind of edgy podcast
 

8815
02:25:51,760 --> 02:25:52,870
you know and some kind of edgy podcast
like red scare

8816
02:25:52,870 --> 02:25:52,880
like red scare
 

8817
02:25:52,880 --> 02:25:54,630
like red scare
is just really entertaining to me

8818
02:25:54,630 --> 02:25:54,640
is just really entertaining to me
 

8819
02:25:54,640 --> 02:25:56,309
is just really entertaining to me
because the banter the women on that

8820
02:25:56,309 --> 02:25:56,319
because the banter the women on that
 

8821
02:25:56,319 --> 02:25:57,910
because the banter the women on that
show is just so good

8822
02:25:57,910 --> 02:25:57,920
show is just so good
 

8823
02:25:57,920 --> 02:25:59,429
show is just so good
and all in and that kind of thing so i

8824
02:25:59,429 --> 02:25:59,439
and all in and that kind of thing so i
 

8825
02:25:59,439 --> 02:26:01,349
and all in and that kind of thing so i
think it's it's a combination of sort of

8826
02:26:01,349 --> 02:26:01,359
think it's it's a combination of sort of
 

8827
02:26:01,359 --> 02:26:02,630
think it's it's a combination of sort of
the arc

8828
02:26:02,630 --> 02:26:02,640
the arc
 

8829
02:26:02,640 --> 02:26:05,750
the arc
and the chemistry and i think because

8830
02:26:05,750 --> 02:26:05,760
and the chemistry and i think because
 

8831
02:26:05,760 --> 02:26:06,070
and the chemistry and i think because
the

8832
02:26:06,070 --> 02:26:06,080
the
 

8833
02:26:06,080 --> 02:26:09,030
the
arc can be so important that's why very

8834
02:26:09,030 --> 02:26:09,040
arc can be so important that's why very
 

8835
02:26:09,040 --> 02:26:10,469
arc can be so important that's why very
very highly produced

8836
02:26:10,469 --> 02:26:10,479
very highly produced
 

8837
02:26:10,479 --> 02:26:13,110
very highly produced
uh podcasts like this american life

8838
02:26:13,110 --> 02:26:13,120
uh podcasts like this american life
 

8839
02:26:13,120 --> 02:26:14,710
uh podcasts like this american life
obviously a radio show but i think of a

8840
02:26:14,710 --> 02:26:14,720
obviously a radio show but i think of a
 

8841
02:26:14,720 --> 02:26:15,830
obviously a radio show but i think of a
podcast because that's how i always

8842
02:26:15,830 --> 02:26:15,840
podcast because that's how i always
 

8843
02:26:15,840 --> 02:26:16,710
podcast because that's how i always
consume it

8844
02:26:16,710 --> 02:26:16,720
consume it
 

8845
02:26:16,720 --> 02:26:19,349
consume it
or criminal or you know a lot of what

8846
02:26:19,349 --> 02:26:19,359
or criminal or you know a lot of what
 

8847
02:26:19,359 --> 02:26:20,230
or criminal or you know a lot of what
wonder he does

8848
02:26:20,230 --> 02:26:20,240
wonder he does
 

8849
02:26:20,240 --> 02:26:23,349
wonder he does
and so forth that is real documentary

8850
02:26:23,349 --> 02:26:23,359
and so forth that is real documentary
 

8851
02:26:23,359 --> 02:26:24,070
and so forth that is real documentary
making

8852
02:26:24,070 --> 02:26:24,080
making
 

8853
02:26:24,080 --> 02:26:25,830
making
and that requires a big team and a big

8854
02:26:25,830 --> 02:26:25,840
and that requires a big team and a big
 

8855
02:26:25,840 --> 02:26:27,110
and that requires a big team and a big
budget relative to the kinds of things

8856
02:26:27,110 --> 02:26:27,120
budget relative to the kinds of things
 

8857
02:26:27,120 --> 02:26:29,190
budget relative to the kinds of things
you and i do but nonetheless

8858
02:26:29,190 --> 02:26:29,200
you and i do but nonetheless
 

8859
02:26:29,200 --> 02:26:31,030
you and i do but nonetheless
then you got that arc and that can be

8860
02:26:31,030 --> 02:26:31,040
then you got that arc and that can be
 

8861
02:26:31,040 --> 02:26:32,469
then you got that arc and that can be
really really compelling but if we go

8862
02:26:32,469 --> 02:26:32,479
really really compelling but if we go
 

8863
02:26:32,479 --> 02:26:32,870
really really compelling but if we go
back

8864
02:26:32,870 --> 02:26:32,880
back
 

8865
02:26:32,880 --> 02:26:35,510
back
to conversation i think it's a

8866
02:26:35,510 --> 02:26:35,520
to conversation i think it's a
 

8867
02:26:35,520 --> 02:26:38,309
to conversation i think it's a
combination of structure and chemistry

8868
02:26:38,309 --> 02:26:38,319
combination of structure and chemistry
 

8869
02:26:38,319 --> 02:26:39,910
combination of structure and chemistry
yeah and i've actually personally have

8870
02:26:39,910 --> 02:26:39,920
yeah and i've actually personally have
 

8871
02:26:39,920 --> 02:26:41,590
yeah and i've actually personally have
lost i used to

8872
02:26:41,590 --> 02:26:41,600
lost i used to
 

8873
02:26:41,600 --> 02:26:43,990
lost i used to
love this american life and for some

8874
02:26:43,990 --> 02:26:44,000
love this american life and for some
 

8875
02:26:44,000 --> 02:26:45,510
love this american life and for some
reason because it lacks

8876
02:26:45,510 --> 02:26:45,520
reason because it lacks
 

8877
02:26:45,520 --> 02:26:48,870
reason because it lacks
the possibility of magic

8878
02:26:48,870 --> 02:26:48,880
the possibility of magic
 

8879
02:26:48,880 --> 02:26:51,990
the possibility of magic
it's engineered magic i i've fallen off

8880
02:26:51,990 --> 02:26:52,000
it's engineered magic i i've fallen off
 

8881
02:26:52,000 --> 02:26:52,710
it's engineered magic i i've fallen off
of it myself

8882
02:26:52,710 --> 02:26:52,720
of it myself
 

8883
02:26:52,720 --> 02:26:55,030
of it myself
as well i mean when i fell madly in love

8884
02:26:55,030 --> 02:26:55,040
as well i mean when i fell madly in love
 

8885
02:26:55,040 --> 02:26:56,550
as well i mean when i fell madly in love
with it during the auts

8886
02:26:56,550 --> 02:26:56,560
with it during the auts
 

8887
02:26:56,560 --> 02:26:58,309
with it during the auts
it was the only thing going yeah they

8888
02:26:58,309 --> 02:26:58,319
it was the only thing going yeah they
 

8889
02:26:58,319 --> 02:27:00,309
it was the only thing going yeah they
were really smart to adopting to adopt

8890
02:27:00,309 --> 02:27:00,319
were really smart to adopting to adopt
 

8891
02:27:00,319 --> 02:27:02,230
were really smart to adopting to adopt
podcasting as a distribution mechanism

8892
02:27:02,230 --> 02:27:02,240
podcasting as a distribution mechanism
 

8893
02:27:02,240 --> 02:27:03,110
podcasting as a distribution mechanism
early

8894
02:27:03,110 --> 02:27:03,120
early
 

8895
02:27:03,120 --> 02:27:06,389
early
um but yeah i think that

8896
02:27:06,389 --> 02:27:06,399
um but yeah i think that
 

8897
02:27:06,399 --> 02:27:08,309
um but yeah i think that
maybe there's a little bit less magic

8898
02:27:08,309 --> 02:27:08,319
maybe there's a little bit less magic
 

8899
02:27:08,319 --> 02:27:09,429
maybe there's a little bit less magic
there now because i think they have

8900
02:27:09,429 --> 02:27:09,439
there now because i think they have
 

8901
02:27:09,439 --> 02:27:10,870
there now because i think they have
agendas other than

8902
02:27:10,870 --> 02:27:10,880
agendas other than
 

8903
02:27:10,880 --> 02:27:12,710
agendas other than
necessarily just delighting their

8904
02:27:12,710 --> 02:27:12,720
necessarily just delighting their
 

8905
02:27:12,720 --> 02:27:14,230
necessarily just delighting their
listeners with quirky stories which i

8906
02:27:14,230 --> 02:27:14,240
listeners with quirky stories which i
 

8907
02:27:14,240 --> 02:27:15,429
listeners with quirky stories which i
think is what it was all about back in

8908
02:27:15,429 --> 02:27:15,439
think is what it was all about back in
 

8909
02:27:15,439 --> 02:27:17,510
think is what it was all about back in
the day and some other things

8910
02:27:17,510 --> 02:27:17,520
the day and some other things
 

8911
02:27:17,520 --> 02:27:19,349
the day and some other things
is there like a memorable conversation

8912
02:27:19,349 --> 02:27:19,359
is there like a memorable conversation
 

8913
02:27:19,359 --> 02:27:22,150
is there like a memorable conversation
that you've had on the podcast whether

8914
02:27:22,150 --> 02:27:22,160
that you've had on the podcast whether
 

8915
02:27:22,160 --> 02:27:25,190
that you've had on the podcast whether
it was because it was wild and

8916
02:27:25,190 --> 02:27:25,200
it was because it was wild and
 

8917
02:27:25,200 --> 02:27:27,830
it was because it was wild and
fun or one that was exceptionally

8918
02:27:27,830 --> 02:27:27,840
fun or one that was exceptionally
 

8919
02:27:27,840 --> 02:27:28,710
fun or one that was exceptionally
challenging

8920
02:27:28,710 --> 02:27:28,720
challenging
 

8921
02:27:28,720 --> 02:27:30,710
challenging
maybe challenging to prepare for that

8922
02:27:30,710 --> 02:27:30,720
maybe challenging to prepare for that
 

8923
02:27:30,720 --> 02:27:31,910
maybe challenging to prepare for that
kind of thing is there something that

8924
02:27:31,910 --> 02:27:31,920
kind of thing is there something that
 

8925
02:27:31,920 --> 02:27:33,429
kind of thing is there something that
stands out in your mind that

8926
02:27:33,429 --> 02:27:33,439
stands out in your mind that
 

8927
02:27:33,439 --> 02:27:35,590
stands out in your mind that
that's uh you can draw an insight from

8928
02:27:35,590 --> 02:27:35,600
that's uh you can draw an insight from
 

8929
02:27:35,600 --> 02:27:36,790
that's uh you can draw an insight from
yeah i mean this

8930
02:27:36,790 --> 02:27:36,800
yeah i mean this
 

8931
02:27:36,800 --> 02:27:39,830
yeah i mean this
no way diminishes the episodes that will

8932
02:27:39,830 --> 02:27:39,840
no way diminishes the episodes that will
 

8933
02:27:39,840 --> 02:27:40,389
no way diminishes the episodes that will
not be

8934
02:27:40,389 --> 02:27:40,399

thing
so i end up in that group now in terms

9992
02:45:02,710 --> 02:45:02,720
so i end up in that group now in terms
 

9993
02:45:02,720 --> 02:45:05,030
so i end up in that group now in terms
of being a commercial internet person or

02:45:05,030 --> 02:45:05,040
of being a commercial internet person or

world wide web person um again uh
 

9999
02:45:09,200 --> 02:45:11,269
world wide web person um again uh
i was in that case barely credentialed i

10000
02:45:11,269 --> 02:45:11,279
i was in that case barely credentialed i

couldn't write a stitch of code
 

10003
02:45:12,960 --> 02:45:15,110
couldn't write a stitch of code
but i got a i had a pretty good mind for

10004
02:45:15,110 --> 02:45:15,120
but i got a i had a pretty good mind for
 

10005

significance of this transition

10010
02:45:21,670 --> 02:45:21,680
significance of this transition
 

10011
02:45:21,680 --> 02:45:23,349
significance of this transition
and this was again we were talking

10012
02:45:23,349 --> 02:45:23,359
and this was again we were talking
 

10013
02:45:23,359 --> 02:45:25,190
and this was again we were talking
earlier about emerging areas

10014
02:45:25,190 --> 02:45:25,200
earlier about emerging areas
 

10015
02:45:25,200 --> 02:45:27,349
earlier about emerging areas
within a few months you know i was in

10016
02:45:27,349 --> 02:45:27,359
within a few months you know i was in
 

10017
02:45:27,359 --> 02:45:29,269
within a few months you know i was in
the relatively top echelon of people in

10018
02:45:29,269 --> 02:45:29,279
the relatively top echelon of people in
 

10019
02:45:29,279 --> 02:45:31,349
the relatively top echelon of people in
terms of just sheer experience

10020
02:45:31,349 --> 02:45:31,359
terms of just sheer experience
 

10021
02:45:31,359 --> 02:45:32,630
terms of just sheer experience
because like let's say it was five

10022
02:45:32,630 --> 02:45:32,640
because like let's say it was five
 

10023
02:45:32,640 --> 02:45:33,990
because like let's say it was five
months into the program there were only

10024
02:45:33,990 --> 02:45:34,000
months into the program there were only
 

10025
02:45:34,000 --> 02:45:35,429
months into the program there were only
so many people who had been doing

10026
02:45:35,429 --> 02:45:35,439
so many people who had been doing
 

10027
02:45:35,439 --> 02:45:36,950
so many people who had been doing
world wide web stuff commercially for

10028
02:45:36,950 --> 02:45:36,960
world wide web stuff commercially for
 

10029
02:45:36,960 --> 02:45:38,950
world wide web stuff commercially for
five months you know and then

10030
02:45:38,950 --> 02:45:38,960
five months you know and then
 

10031
02:45:38,960 --> 02:45:41,349
five months you know and then
what was interesting though was the

10032
02:45:41,349 --> 02:45:41,359
what was interesting though was the
 

10033
02:45:41,359 --> 02:45:42,070
what was interesting though was the
intersection

10034
02:45:42,070 --> 02:45:42,080
intersection
 

10035
02:45:42,080 --> 02:45:44,469
intersection
of those two things the commercial web

10036
02:45:44,469 --> 02:45:44,479
of those two things the commercial web
 

10037
02:45:44,479 --> 02:45:46,469
of those two things the commercial web
as it turned out grew into

10038
02:45:46,469 --> 02:45:46,479
as it turned out grew into
 

10039
02:45:46,479 --> 02:45:49,510
as it turned out grew into
uh unbelievable vastness

10040
02:45:49,510 --> 02:45:49,520
uh unbelievable vastness
 

10041
02:45:49,520 --> 02:45:52,710
uh unbelievable vastness
and so by being a pretty good okay web

10042
02:45:52,710 --> 02:45:52,720
and so by being a pretty good okay web
 

10043
02:45:52,720 --> 02:45:53,429
and so by being a pretty good okay web
person

10044
02:45:53,429 --> 02:45:53,439
person
 

10045
02:45:53,439 --> 02:45:56,550
person
and a pretty good okay mba person

10046
02:45:56,550 --> 02:45:56,560
and a pretty good okay mba person
 

10047
02:45:56,560 --> 02:45:58,550
and a pretty good okay mba person
that intersection put me in a very rare

10048
02:45:58,550 --> 02:45:58,560
that intersection put me in a very rare
 

10049
02:45:58,560 --> 02:46:00,630
that intersection put me in a very rare
group which was

10050
02:46:00,630 --> 02:46:00,640
group which was
 

10051
02:46:00,640 --> 02:46:03,750
group which was
web oriented mbas and

10052
02:46:03,750 --> 02:46:03,760
web oriented mbas and
 

10053
02:46:03,760 --> 02:46:05,830
web oriented mbas and
in those early days you could probably

in those early days you could probably
 

10055
02:46:05,840 --> 02:46:07,590
in those early days you could probably
count on your fingers

10056
02:46:07,590 --> 02:46:07,600
count on your fingers
 

10057
02:46:07,600 --> 02:46:08,790
count on your fingers
the number of people who came out a

10058
02:46:08,790 --> 02:46:08,800
the number of people who came out a
 

10059
02:46:08,800 --> 02:46:10,150
the number of people who came out a
really competitive programs who were

10060

really competitive programs who were
 

10061
02:46:10,160 --> 02:46:11,670
really competitive programs who were
doing stuff full-time on the internet

finding an intersection of two things

10084
02:46:33,190 --> 02:46:33,200
finding an intersection of two things
 

10085
02:46:33,200 --> 02:46:33,830
finding an intersection of two things
you can be

10086
02:46:33,830 --> 02:46:33,840
you can be
 

10087
02:46:33,840 --> 02:46:36,389
you can be
pretty good at but is a rare

02:46:36,389 --> 02:46:36,399

intersection
 

10091
02:46:37,520 --> 02:46:40,309

and a special intersection is probably a

02:46:40,309 --> 02:46:40,319
and a special intersection is probably a
 

10093
02:46:40,319 --> 02:46:40,950
and a special intersection is probably a

10102
02:46:47,269 --> 02:46:47,279
than trying to be world-class at this
 

10103
02:46:47,279 --> 02:46:48,550
than trying to be world-class at this
one thing

10104
02:46:48,550 --> 02:46:48,560
one thing
 

10105
02:46:48,560 --> 02:46:50,710
one thing
so in the intersection is where there's

10106
02:46:50,710 --> 02:46:50,720
so in the intersection is where there's
 

10107
02:46:50,720 --> 02:46:51,990
so in the intersection is where there's
a to be discovered

10108
02:46:51,990 --> 02:46:52,000
a to be discovered
 

10109
02:46:52,000 --> 02:46:53,510

opportunity and success that's really

10110
02:46:53,510 --> 02:46:53,520
opportunity and success that's really
 

10111
02:46:53,520 --> 02:46:55,590
opportunity and success that's really
interesting yeah there's actually more

10112
02:46:55,590 --> 02:46:55,600
interesting yeah there's actually more
 

10113
02:46:55,600 --> 02:46:57,190

02:46:58,870 --> 02:46:58,880
themselves right so
 

10117
02:46:58,880 --> 02:47:00,230
themselves right so
yeah i mean i'll give you kind of a

10118
02:47:00,230 --> 02:47:00,240
yeah i mean i'll give you kind of a
 

10119
02:47:00,240 --> 02:47:02,230
yeah i mean i'll give you kind of a
funny hypothetical here but it's one

10120
02:47:02,230 --> 02:47:02,240
funny hypothetical here but it's one
 

10121
02:47:02,240 --> 02:47:03,830
funny hypothetical here but it's one
i've been thinking about a little bit

10122
02:47:03,830 --> 02:47:03,840
i've been thinking about a little bit
 

10123
02:47:03,840 --> 02:47:05,590
i've been thinking about a little bit
um there's a lot of people in crypto

10124
02:47:05,590 --> 02:47:05,600
um there's a lot of people in crypto
 

10125
02:47:05,600 --> 02:47:06,870
um there's a lot of people in crypto
right now it'd be

10126
02:47:06,870 --> 02:47:06,880
right now it'd be
 

10127
02:47:06,880 --> 02:47:09,910
right now it'd be
hard to be in the top percentile of

02:47:09,910 --> 02:47:09,920
hard to be in the top percentile of

02:47:17,520 --> 02:47:19,830
to call it
um and then there's this parallel world

10142
02:47:19,830 --> 02:47:19,840
um and then there's this parallel world
 

10143
02:47:19,840 --> 02:47:21,670
um and then there's this parallel world
an orthogonal world called crop

10144
02:47:21,670 --> 02:47:21,680
an orthogonal world called crop
 

10145

you know large agricultural concerns
 

10163
02:47:35,120 --> 02:47:36,550
you know large agricultural concerns
that are worried about that

10164

that are worried about that
 

10165
02:47:36,560 --> 02:47:39,190
that are worried about that
um somewhere out there is somebody who

10166

um somewhere out there is somebody who
 

10167
02:47:39,200 --> 02:47:41,030
um somewhere out there is somebody who
is pretty crypto savvy but probably not

02:47:58,160 --> 02:48:00,070
defy one of the interesting and i think
very world positive things that i think

02:48:00,070 --> 02:48:00,080
very world positive things that i think
 

10189
02:48:00,080 --> 02:48:02,070
very world positive things that i think
it's almost inevitably we'll be bringing

it's almost inevitably we'll be bringing

um i do try to do that as little as

10304
02:49:56,630 --> 02:49:56,640
um i do try to do that as little as
 

10305
02:49:56,640 --> 02:49:57,910
um i do try to do that as little as
possible because there's not a lot i can

02:49:57,910 --> 02:49:57,920
possible because there's not a lot i can

um but it's inevitably there and i think
 

10311
02:50:01,680 --> 02:50:02,389
um but it's inevitably there and i think
that

10312

that
 

10313
02:50:02,399 --> 02:50:04,710

the right way
 

10317
02:50:06,000 --> 02:50:09,030
the right way
is it makes you realize how

10318
02:50:09,030 --> 02:50:09,040
is it makes you realize how
 

10319
02:50:09,040 --> 02:50:11,190
is it makes you realize how
unbelievably rare and precious the

so but i i guess the the
 

10545
02:54:01,439 --> 02:54:04,950
so but i i guess the the
the fundamental calculation is whether

10546
02:54:04,950 --> 02:54:04,960
the fundamental calculation is whether
 

10547
02:54:04,960 --> 02:54:07,670
the fundamental calculation is whether
the passion for the vision is greater

10548
02:54:07,670 --> 02:54:07,680
the passion for the vision is greater
 

10549
02:54:07,680 --> 02:54:08,950
the passion for the vision is greater
than the cost you'll pay

10550
02:54:08,950 --> 02:54:08,960
than the cost you'll pay
 

10551
02:54:08,960 --> 02:54:11,670
than the cost you'll pay
right it's all opportunity cost it's all

10552
02:54:11,670 --> 02:54:11,680
right it's all opportunity cost it's all
 

10553
02:54:11,680 --> 02:54:13,590
right it's all opportunity cost it's all
opportunity cost

10554
02:54:13,590 --> 02:54:13,600
opportunity cost
 

10555
02:54:13,600 --> 02:54:15,429
opportunity cost
in terms of time and attention and

10556
02:54:15,429 --> 02:54:15,439
in terms of time and attention and
 

10557
02:54:15,439 --> 02:54:18,230
in terms of time and attention and
experience and some things like i'm i'm

10558
02:54:18,230 --> 02:54:18,240
experience and some things like i'm i'm
 

10559
02:54:18,240 --> 02:54:19,590
experience and some things like i'm i'm
everyone's different but i'm less

10560
02:54:19,590 --> 02:54:19,600
everyone's different but i'm less
 

10561
02:54:19,600 --> 02:54:21,269
everyone's different but i'm less
calculating some things you just can't

10562
02:54:21,269 --> 02:54:21,279
calculating some things you just can't
 

10563
02:54:21,279 --> 02:54:23,510
calculating some things you just can't
help sometimes you just dive in

10564
02:54:23,510 --> 02:54:23,520
help sometimes you just dive in
 

10565
02:54:23,520 --> 02:54:25,670
help sometimes you just dive in
oh yeah i mean you can do balance beats

10566
02:54:25,670 --> 02:54:25,680
oh yeah i mean you can do balance beats
 

10567
02:54:25,680 --> 02:54:27,510
oh yeah i mean you can do balance beats
all you want on this versus that and

10568
02:54:27,510 --> 02:54:27,520
all you want on this versus that and
 

10569
02:54:27,520 --> 02:54:28,790
all you want on this versus that and
what's the right i mean i've done it in

that
you know there's a few things and um

you know there's a few things and um
 

10589
02:54:50,720 --> 02:54:53,110
you know there's a few things and um
you know one of them is certainly love

02:54:53,110 --> 02:54:53,120
you know one of them is certainly love
 

10591
02:54:53,120 --> 02:54:53,990
you know one of them is certainly love
and

10592
02:54:53,990 --> 02:54:54,000
and
 

10593
02:54:54,000 --> 02:54:57,269
and
the love that we experience and feel

10594
02:54:57,269 --> 02:54:57,279
the love that we experience and feel
 

10595
02:54:57,279 --> 02:55:00,389
the love that we experience and feel
and cause to well up in others is

10596
02:55:00,389 --> 02:55:00,399
and cause to well up in others is
 

10597
02:55:00,399 --> 02:55:01,670
and cause to well up in others is
something that's just

10598
02:55:01,670 --> 02:55:01,680
something that's just
 

10599
02:55:01,680 --> 02:55:05,269
something that's just
so profound and goes beyond

10600
02:55:05,269 --> 02:55:05,279
so profound and goes beyond
 

10601
02:55:05,279 --> 02:55:08,550
so profound and goes beyond
almost anything else that we can do and

10602
02:55:08,550 --> 02:55:08,560
almost anything else that we can do and
 

10603
02:55:08,560 --> 02:55:11,110
almost anything else that we can do and
whether that is something that lies in

10604
02:55:11,110 --> 02:55:11,120
whether that is something that lies in
 

10605
02:55:11,120 --> 02:55:12,870
whether that is something that lies in
the past like maybe there was somebody

10606
02:55:12,870 --> 02:55:12,880
the past like maybe there was somebody
 

10607
02:55:12,880 --> 02:55:13,670
the past like maybe there was somebody
that you

10608
02:55:13,670 --> 02:55:13,680

you've done but nonetheless
 

10659
02:55:59,040 --> 02:56:02,230
you've done but nonetheless
the the creations that we make

10660
02:56:02,230 --> 02:56:02,240
the the creations that we make
 

10661
02:56:02,240 --> 02:56:05,750
the the creations that we make
and whether it's the love or the joy or

10662
02:56:05,750 --> 02:56:05,760
and whether it's the love or the joy or

10667
02:56:11,040 --> 02:56:12,870
that that cascades into other minds
i think that's a big big big part of the

10668
02:56:12,870 --> 02:56:12,880
i think that's a big big big part of the
 

10669
02:56:12,880 --> 02:56:14,230
i think that's a big big big part of the
meaning of life it's not something that

10670
02:56:14,230 --> 02:56:14,240
meaning of life it's not something that
 

10671
02:56:14,240 --> 02:56:16,550
meaning of life it's not something that
everybody participates in necessarily

10672
02:56:16,550 --> 02:56:16,560
everybody participates in necessarily
 

10673
02:56:16,560 --> 02:56:18,790
everybody participates in necessarily
although i think we all do you know at

10674
02:56:18,790 --> 02:56:18,800
although i think we all do you know at
 

10675
02:56:18,800 --> 02:56:20,469
although i think we all do you know at
least in a very local

10676
02:56:20,469 --> 02:56:20,479
least in a very local
 

10677
02:56:20,479 --> 02:56:23,110
least in a very local
level by you know the example that we

10678
02:56:23,110 --> 02:56:23,120
level by you know the example that we
 

10679
02:56:23,120 --> 02:56:25,429
level by you know the example that we
set by the interactions that we have

10680
02:56:25,429 --> 02:56:25,439
set by the interactions that we have
 

10681
02:56:25,439 --> 02:56:28,389
set by the interactions that we have
but for people who create works that

10682
02:56:28,389 --> 02:56:28,399
but for people who create works that
 

10683
02:56:28,399 --> 02:56:28,950
but for people who create works that
travel

10684
02:56:28,950 --> 02:56:28,960
travel
 

10685
02:56:28,960 --> 02:56:31,510
travel
far and reach people they'll never meet

10686
02:56:31,510 --> 02:56:31,520
far and reach people they'll never meet
 

10687
02:56:31,520 --> 02:56:33,750
far and reach people they'll never meet
that reach countries they'll never visit

10688
02:56:33,750 --> 02:56:33,760
that reach countries they'll never visit
 

10689
02:56:33,760 --> 02:56:36,070
that reach countries they'll never visit
that reach people perhaps that come

10690
02:56:36,070 --> 02:56:36,080
that reach people perhaps that come
 

10691
02:56:36,080 --> 02:56:37,750
that reach people perhaps that come
along and come across their ideas or

10692
02:56:37,750 --> 02:56:37,760
along and come across their ideas or
 

10693
02:56:37,760 --> 02:56:39,349
along and come across their ideas or
their works or their stories or

10694
02:56:39,349 --> 02:56:39,359
their works or their stories or
 

10695
02:56:39,359 --> 02:56:41,190
their works or their stories or
their aesthetic creations of other sorts

10696
02:56:41,190 --> 02:56:41,200
their aesthetic creations of other sorts
 

10697
02:56:41,200 --> 02:56:42,950
their aesthetic creations of other sorts
long after they're dead

10698
02:56:42,950 --> 02:56:42,960
long after they're dead
 

10699
02:56:42,960 --> 02:56:45,590
long after they're dead
um i think that's really really big part
