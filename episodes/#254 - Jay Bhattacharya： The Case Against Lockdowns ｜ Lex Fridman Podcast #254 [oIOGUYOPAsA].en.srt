in cerro prevalence it does sound like
you say zero prevalence it's not it's

00:04:23,510 --> 00:04:23,520
you say zero prevalence it's not it's

cerro and serology's antibodies so it's

234
00:04:26,469 --> 00:04:26,479
cerro and serology's antibodies so it's
 

235
00:04:26,479 --> 00:04:28,469
cerro and serology's antibodies so it's
it's a a survey that counts the number

236
00:04:28,469 --> 00:04:28,479
it's a a survey that counts the number
 

237
00:04:28,479 --> 00:04:31,030
it's a a survey that counts the number
of antibodies specifically

238
00:04:31,030 --> 00:04:31,040
of antibodies specifically
 

239
00:04:31,040 --> 00:04:33,430
of antibodies specifically
people that have antibodies

240
00:04:33,430 --> 00:04:33,440
people that have antibodies
 

241
00:04:33,440 --> 00:04:36,230
people that have antibodies
specific to kovaid which perhaps shows

242
00:04:36,230 --> 00:04:36,240
specific to kovaid which perhaps shows
 

243
00:04:36,240 --> 00:04:38,629
specific to kovaid which perhaps shows
an indication that they likely have had

244
00:04:38,629 --> 00:04:38,639
an indication that they likely have had
 

245
00:04:38,639 --> 00:04:40,790
an indication that they likely have had
cobit and therefore this is a way to

246
00:04:40,790 --> 00:04:40,800
cobit and therefore this is a way to
 

247
00:04:40,800 --> 00:04:43,030
cobit and therefore this is a way to
study how many people in the population

248
00:04:43,030 --> 00:04:43,040
study how many people in the population
 

249
00:04:43,040 --> 00:04:45,430
study how many people in the population
have been exposed to have had

250
00:04:45,430 --> 00:04:45,440
have been exposed to have had
 

251
00:04:45,440 --> 00:04:48,150
have been exposed to have had
exactly yeah exactly so the idea is that

252
00:04:48,150 --> 00:04:48,160
exactly yeah exactly so the idea is that
 

253
00:04:48,160 --> 00:04:50,310
exactly yeah exactly so the idea is that
uh

254
00:04:50,310 --> 00:04:50,320
uh
 

255
00:04:50,320 --> 00:04:51,749
uh
we don't know

256
00:04:51,749 --> 00:04:51,759
we don't know
 

257
00:04:51,759 --> 00:04:53,430
we don't know
exactly the number of people with cove

258
00:04:53,430 --> 00:04:53,440
exactly the number of people with cove
 

259
00:04:53,440 --> 00:04:55,110
exactly the number of people with cove
just by counting the people that are

260
00:04:55,110 --> 00:04:55,120
just by counting the people that are
 

261
00:04:55,120 --> 00:04:56,469
just by counting the people that are
there to present themselves with

262
00:04:56,469 --> 00:04:56,479
there to present themselves with
 

263
00:04:56,479 --> 00:04:58,710
there to present themselves with
symptoms of covid um covet has it turns

264
00:04:58,710 --> 00:04:58,720
symptoms of covid um covet has it turns
 

265
00:04:58,720 --> 00:05:00,629
symptoms of covid um covet has it turns
out a very wide range of symptoms

266
00:05:00,629 --> 00:05:00,639
out a very wide range of symptoms
 

267
00:05:00,639 --> 00:05:04,070
out a very wide range of symptoms
possible ranging from no symptoms at all

268
00:05:04,070 --> 00:05:04,080
possible ranging from no symptoms at all
 

269
00:05:04,080 --> 00:05:05,990
possible ranging from no symptoms at all
to this deadly viral pneumonia that's

270
00:05:05,990 --> 00:05:06,000
to this deadly viral pneumonia that's
 

271
00:05:06,000 --> 00:05:08,230
to this deadly viral pneumonia that's
killed so many people and the problem is

272
00:05:08,230 --> 00:05:08,240
killed so many people and the problem is
 

273
00:05:08,240 --> 00:05:09,909
killed so many people and the problem is
like in if you just count the number of

274
00:05:09,909 --> 00:05:09,919
like in if you just count the number of
 

275
00:05:09,919 --> 00:05:11,110
like in if you just count the number of
cases the people who have very few

276
00:05:11,110 --> 00:05:11,120
cases the people who have very few
 

277
00:05:11,120 --> 00:05:13,830
cases the people who have very few
symptoms so often don't show up for

278
00:05:13,830 --> 00:05:13,840
symptoms so often don't show up for
 

279
00:05:13,840 --> 00:05:15,510
symptoms so often don't show up for
testing we just don't they're outside of

280
00:05:15,510 --> 00:05:15,520
testing we just don't they're outside of
 

281
00:05:15,520 --> 00:05:17,990
testing we just don't they're outside of
the can of of public health

282
00:05:17,990 --> 00:05:18,000
the can of of public health
 

283
00:05:18,000 --> 00:05:20,790
the can of of public health
and so it's really hard to know that the

284
00:05:20,790 --> 00:05:20,800
and so it's really hard to know that the
 

285
00:05:20,800 --> 00:05:22,230
and so it's really hard to know that the
answer to your question without

286
00:05:22,230 --> 00:05:22,240
answer to your question without
 

287
00:05:22,240 --> 00:05:23,510
answer to your question without
understanding how many people are

288
00:05:23,510 --> 00:05:23,520
understanding how many people are
 

289
00:05:23,520 --> 00:05:25,270
understanding how many people are
infected because you you can probably

290
00:05:25,270 --> 00:05:25,280
infected because you you can probably
 

291
00:05:25,280 --> 00:05:26,469
infected because you you can probably
tell the number of deaths that's even

292
00:05:26,469 --> 00:05:26,479
tell the number of deaths that's even
 

293
00:05:26,479 --> 00:05:27,670
tell the number of deaths that's even
though there's some controversy over

294
00:05:27,670 --> 00:05:27,680
though there's some controversy over
 

295
00:05:27,680 --> 00:05:30,390
though there's some controversy over
that but uh that so that the numerators

296
00:05:30,390 --> 00:05:30,400
that but uh that so that the numerators
 

297
00:05:30,400 --> 00:05:32,230
that but uh that so that the numerators
is possible but the denominator is much

298
00:05:32,230 --> 00:05:32,240
is possible but the denominator is much
 

299
00:05:32,240 --> 00:05:34,310
is possible but the denominator is much
harder how much controversy is there

300
00:05:34,310 --> 00:05:34,320
harder how much controversy is there
 

301
00:05:34,320 --> 00:05:35,830
harder how much controversy is there
about the death we're gonna go on

302
00:05:35,830 --> 00:05:35,840
about the death we're gonna go on
 

303
00:05:35,840 --> 00:05:38,550
about the death we're gonna go on
million tangents is that okay we're

304
00:05:38,550 --> 00:05:38,560
million tangents is that okay we're
 

305
00:05:38,560 --> 00:05:41,430
million tangents is that okay we're
gonna i have a million questions so one

306
00:05:41,430 --> 00:05:41,440
gonna i have a million questions so one
 

307
00:05:41,440 --> 00:05:43,430

i love data so much

308
00:05:43,430 --> 00:05:43,440
i love data so much
 

309
00:05:43,440 --> 00:05:45,670
i love data so much
but i've like almost tuned out paying

310
00:05:45,670 --> 00:05:45,680
but i've like almost tuned out paying
 

311
00:05:45,680 --> 00:05:47,749
but i've like almost tuned out paying
attention to cover data because i feel

312
00:05:47,749 --> 00:05:47,759
attention to cover data because i feel
 

313
00:05:47,759 --> 00:05:50,230
attention to cover data because i feel
like i'm walking on shaky ground i don't

314
00:05:50,230 --> 00:05:50,240
like i'm walking on shaky ground i don't
 

315
00:05:50,240 --> 00:05:51,590
like i'm walking on shaky ground i don't
know who to trust

316
00:05:51,590 --> 00:05:51,600
know who to trust
 

317
00:05:51,600 --> 00:05:53,430
know who to trust
um maybe you can comment on different

318
00:05:53,430 --> 00:05:53,440
um maybe you can comment on different
 

319
00:05:53,440 --> 00:05:55,990
um maybe you can comment on different
sources of data different kinds of data

the death one that seems like a really

00:05:57,909 --> 00:05:57,919
the death one that seems like a really
 

323
00:05:57,919 --> 00:05:59,110
the death one that seems like a really
important one

324
00:05:59,110 --> 00:05:59,120
important one
 

325
00:05:59,120 --> 00:06:01,990
important one
can we trust the reported deaths

326
00:06:01,990 --> 00:06:02,000
can we trust the reported deaths
 

327
00:06:02,000 --> 00:06:03,909
can we trust the reported deaths
associated with covid or is it just a

328
00:06:03,909 --> 00:06:03,919
associated with covid or is it just a
 

329
00:06:03,919 --> 00:06:06,230
associated with covid or is it just a
giant messy thing that mixed up and then

330
00:06:06,230 --> 00:06:06,240
giant messy thing that mixed up and then
 

331
00:06:06,240 --> 00:06:08,390
giant messy thing that mixed up and then
there's this kind of stories about

a patient that well that diabetes could
 

407
00:07:17,280 --> 00:07:19,110
a patient that well that diabetes could
lead to

408

it's really difficult to like

426
00:07:35,589 --> 00:07:35,599
it's really difficult to like

now what's the evidence of this there's
been a couple of

psychological question because it seems
like

494
00:08:38,550 --> 00:08:38,560
like
 

495
00:08:38,560 --> 00:08:41,350
like
every single person who's passed away

496
00:08:41,350 --> 00:08:41,360
every single person who's passed away
 

497
00:08:41,360 --> 00:08:43,269
every single person who's passed away
over the past couple of years kind of

498
00:08:43,269 --> 00:08:43,279
over the past couple of years kind of
 

499
00:08:43,279 --> 00:08:44,949
over the past couple of years kind of
the first question that comes to mind is

500
00:08:44,949 --> 00:08:44,959
the first question that comes to mind is
 

501
00:08:44,959 --> 00:08:47,350
the first question that comes to mind is
just was it not not just because you're

502
00:08:47,350 --> 00:08:47,360
just was it not not just because you're
 

503
00:08:47,360 --> 00:08:48,870
just was it not not just because you're
trying to be political but just in your

504
00:08:48,870 --> 00:08:48,880
trying to be political but just in your
 

505
00:08:48,880 --> 00:08:51,030
trying to be political but just in your
mind no i think there's a psychological

506
00:08:51,030 --> 00:08:51,040
mind no i think there's a psychological
 

507
00:08:51,040 --> 00:08:53,190
mind no i think there's a psychological
reason for this right so um

508
00:08:53,190 --> 00:08:53,200
reason for this right so um
 

509
00:08:53,200 --> 00:08:55,110
reason for this right so um
you know we have we spent uh the better

510
00:08:55,110 --> 00:08:55,120
you know we have we spent uh the better
 

511
00:08:55,120 --> 00:08:57,030
you know we have we spent uh the better
part of a at least a half century in the

512
00:08:57,030 --> 00:08:57,040
part of a at least a half century in the
 

513
00:08:57,040 --> 00:08:59,350
part of a at least a half century in the
united states not worried too much

514
00:08:59,350 --> 00:08:59,360
united states not worried too much
 

515
00:08:59,360 --> 00:09:01,670
united states not worried too much
about infectious diseases and we the

516
00:09:01,670 --> 00:09:01,680
about infectious diseases and we the
 

517
00:09:01,680 --> 00:09:03,190
about infectious diseases and we the
notion was we'd essentially conquered

518
00:09:03,190 --> 00:09:03,200
notion was we'd essentially conquered
 

519
00:09:03,200 --> 00:09:04,790
notion was we'd essentially conquered
them it was something that happens in

520
00:09:04,790 --> 00:09:04,800
them it was something that happens in
 

521
00:09:04,800 --> 00:09:07,670
them it was something that happens in
faraway places to other people

522
00:09:07,670 --> 00:09:07,680
faraway places to other people
 

523
00:09:07,680 --> 00:09:08,790
faraway places to other people
and that's true for much of the

524
00:09:08,790 --> 00:09:08,800
and that's true for much of the
 

525
00:09:08,800 --> 00:09:10,710
and that's true for much of the
developed world life expectancies were

526
00:09:10,710 --> 00:09:10,720
developed world life expectancies were
 

527
00:09:10,720 --> 00:09:11,670
developed world life expectancies were
going up

528
00:09:11,670 --> 00:09:11,680
going up
 

529
00:09:11,680 --> 00:09:13,829
going up
for you know decades and decades

530
00:09:13,829 --> 00:09:13,839
for you know decades and decades
 

531
00:09:13,839 --> 00:09:15,990
for you know decades and decades
and for the first time in living memory

532
00:09:15,990 --> 00:09:16,000
and for the first time in living memory
 

533
00:09:16,000 --> 00:09:18,150
and for the first time in living memory
we have a disease that can kill us

534
00:09:18,150 --> 00:09:18,160
we have a disease that can kill us
 

535
00:09:18,160 --> 00:09:20,230
we have a disease that can kill us
i mean i think we're effectively evolved

536
00:09:20,230 --> 00:09:20,240
i mean i think we're effectively evolved
 

537
00:09:20,240 --> 00:09:22,710
i mean i think we're effectively evolved
to fear that like the the panic centers

538
00:09:22,710 --> 00:09:22,720
to fear that like the the panic centers
 

539
00:09:22,720 --> 00:09:24,070
to fear that like the the panic centers
of our brain the lizard part of our

540
00:09:24,070 --> 00:09:24,080
of our brain the lizard part of our
 

541
00:09:24,080 --> 00:09:25,829
of our brain the lizard part of our
brain takes over

542
00:09:25,829 --> 00:09:25,839
brain takes over
 

543
00:09:25,839 --> 00:09:28,150
brain takes over
and our central focus has been avoiding

544
00:09:28,150 --> 00:09:28,160
and our central focus has been avoiding
 

545
00:09:28,160 --> 00:09:29,750
and our central focus has been avoiding
this one risk

546
00:09:29,750 --> 00:09:29,760
this one risk
 

547
00:09:29,760 --> 00:09:31,990
this one risk
um and so it's not surprising that but

548
00:09:31,990 --> 00:09:32,000
um and so it's not surprising that but
 

549
00:09:32,000 --> 00:09:33,269
um and so it's not surprising that but
people when they're filling out death

550
00:09:33,269 --> 00:09:33,279
people when they're filling out death
 

551
00:09:33,279 --> 00:09:35,350
people when they're filling out death
certificates or thinking about what what

552
00:09:35,350 --> 00:09:35,360
certificates or thinking about what what
 

553
00:09:35,360 --> 00:09:36,470
certificates or thinking about what what
led to the death

554
00:09:36,470 --> 00:09:36,480
led to the death
 

555
00:09:36,480 --> 00:09:38,630
led to the death
this most salient thing that's in the

556
00:09:38,630 --> 00:09:38,640
this most salient thing that's in the
 

557
00:09:38,640 --> 00:09:40,470
this most salient thing that's in the
front of everyone's brain would jump to

558
00:09:40,470 --> 00:09:40,480
front of everyone's brain would jump to
 

559
00:09:40,480 --> 00:09:42,230
front of everyone's brain would jump to
the top

560
00:09:42,230 --> 00:09:42,240
the top
 

561
00:09:42,240 --> 00:09:44,230
the top
and we can't ignore

562
00:09:44,230 --> 00:09:44,240
and we can't ignore
 

563
00:09:44,240 --> 00:09:46,949
and we can't ignore
this very deep psychological thing when

564
00:09:46,949 --> 00:09:46,959
this very deep psychological thing when
 

565
00:09:46,959 --> 00:09:49,110
this very deep psychological thing when
we consider

566
00:09:49,110 --> 00:09:49,120
we consider
 

567
00:09:49,120 --> 00:09:51,030
we consider
what people say on the internet what

568
00:09:51,030 --> 00:09:51,040
what people say on the internet what
 

569

people say to each other what people

00:09:52,640 --> 00:09:54,550
people say to each other what people
write in scientific papers what

572
00:09:54,550 --> 00:09:54,560
write in scientific papers what
 

573
00:09:54,560 --> 00:09:57,350
write in scientific papers what
everything it feels like

574
00:09:57,350 --> 00:09:57,360
everything it feels like
 

575
00:09:57,360 --> 00:09:59,110
everything it feels like
when covid

00:09:59,110 --> 00:09:59,120
when covid
 

577
00:09:59,120 --> 00:10:00,550
when covid
has been

578
00:10:00,550 --> 00:10:00,560
has been
 

579
00:10:00,560 --> 00:10:02,310
has been
um

580
00:10:02,310 --> 00:10:02,320

the the level of emotion involved
 

591
00:10:15,680 --> 00:10:18,069
the the level of emotion involved
i think it in many people it brought out

592
00:10:18,069 --> 00:10:18,079
i think it in many people it brought out
 

593
00:10:18,079 --> 00:10:20,470
i think it in many people it brought out
the worst in them

the worst in them
 

595
00:10:20,480 --> 00:10:22,150
the worst in them
for sometimes short periods of time and

596
00:10:22,150 --> 00:10:22,160
for sometimes short periods of time and
 

597
00:10:22,160 --> 00:10:24,150
for sometimes short periods of time and
sometimes it was always therapeutic like

598
00:10:24,150 --> 00:10:24,160
sometimes it was always therapeutic like
 

599
00:10:24,160 --> 00:10:25,750
sometimes it was always therapeutic like
you were waiting to get out like the

600
00:10:25,750 --> 00:10:25,760
you were waiting to get out like the
 

601
00:10:25,760 --> 00:10:27,590
you were waiting to get out like the
darkest parts of you

602
00:10:27,590 --> 00:10:27,600
darkest parts of you
 

603
00:10:27,600 --> 00:10:29,509
darkest parts of you
just to say if you're angry at something

604
00:10:29,509 --> 00:10:29,519
just to say if you're angry at something
 

605
00:10:29,519 --> 00:10:31,590
just to say if you're angry at something
in this world i'm going to say it now

606
00:10:31,590 --> 00:10:31,600
in this world i'm going to say it now
 

607
00:10:31,600 --> 00:10:33,910
in this world i'm going to say it now
and um i think that's probably talking

608
00:10:33,910 --> 00:10:33,920
and um i think that's probably talking
 

609
00:10:33,920 --> 00:10:36,550
and um i think that's probably talking
to some deep primal thing that

610
00:10:36,550 --> 00:10:36,560
to some deep primal thing that
 

611
00:10:36,560 --> 00:10:37,509
to some deep primal thing that
um

612
00:10:37,509 --> 00:10:37,519
um
 

613
00:10:37,519 --> 00:10:40,069
um
fear we have for um

614
00:10:40,069 --> 00:10:40,079
fear we have for um
 

615
00:10:40,079 --> 00:10:41,829
fear we have for um
formalities of all different kinds and

formalities of all different kinds and
 

617
00:10:41,839 --> 00:10:44,230
formalities of all different kinds and
then when that fear is aroused and all

618
00:10:44,230 --> 00:10:44,240
then when that fear is aroused and all
 

619
00:10:44,240 --> 00:10:46,870
then when that fear is aroused and all
the deepest emotions it's like a

00:10:46,870 --> 00:10:46,880
the deepest emotions it's like a
 

621
00:10:46,880 --> 00:10:48,069
the deepest emotions it's like a

on top of that is also this sort of

636
00:11:03,829 --> 00:11:03,839
on top of that is also this sort of
 

637
00:11:03,839 --> 00:11:06,630
on top of that is also this sort of
uh this impetus to empathy to empathize

638
00:11:06,630 --> 00:11:06,640
uh this impetus to empathy to empathize

actions
and

648
00:11:17,430 --> 00:11:17,440
and
 

649
00:11:17,440 --> 00:11:20,150
and
uh those actions if i if i don't do them

650
00:11:20,150 --> 00:11:20,160

diseases to each other right
but we're not actually designed as a

00:14:11,750 --> 00:14:11,760
but we're not actually designed as a
 

821
00:14:11,760 --> 00:14:13,990
but we're not actually designed as a

822
00:14:13,990 --> 00:14:14,000
species to live that way
 

823
00:14:14,000 --> 00:14:15,670
species to live that way
and that uh what you're describing i

824
00:14:15,670 --> 00:14:15,680
and that uh what you're describing i
 

825
00:14:15,680 --> 00:14:16,470
and that uh what you're describing i
think

826
00:14:16,470 --> 00:14:16,480
think
 

827
00:14:16,480 --> 00:14:17,990
think
if everyone's honest with themselves

828
00:14:17,990 --> 00:14:18,000
if everyone's honest with themselves
 

829
00:14:18,000 --> 00:14:20,230
if everyone's honest with themselves
have felt uh especially in places where

830
00:14:20,230 --> 00:14:20,240
have felt uh especially in places where
 

831
00:14:20,240 --> 00:14:22,150
have felt uh especially in places where
that where lockdowns have been sort of

832
00:14:22,150 --> 00:14:22,160
that where lockdowns have been sort of
 

833
00:14:22,160 --> 00:14:24,790
that where lockdowns have been sort of
very militantly enforced has felt deep

834
00:14:24,790 --> 00:14:24,800
very militantly enforced has felt deep
 

835
00:14:24,800 --> 00:14:26,230
very militantly enforced has felt deep
into their core

836
00:14:26,230 --> 00:14:26,240
into their core
 

837
00:14:26,240 --> 00:14:27,910
into their core
well i if i could just return to the

838
00:14:27,910 --> 00:14:27,920
well i if i could just return to the
 

839
00:14:27,920 --> 00:14:30,790
well i if i could just return to the
question of deaths he said that the data

840
00:14:30,790 --> 00:14:30,800
question of deaths he said that the data
 

841
00:14:30,800 --> 00:14:33,110
question of deaths he said that the data
isn't perfect because we need these kind

842
00:14:33,110 --> 00:14:33,120
isn't perfect because we need these kind
 

843
00:14:33,120 --> 00:14:35,509
isn't perfect because we need these kind
of serial prevalence surveys to

844
00:14:35,509 --> 00:14:35,519
of serial prevalence surveys to
 

845
00:14:35,519 --> 00:14:37,910
of serial prevalence surveys to
understand how many cases there were to

846
00:14:37,910 --> 00:14:37,920
understand how many cases there were to
 

847
00:14:37,920 --> 00:14:39,829
understand how many cases there were to
determine the rate of deaths

848
00:14:39,829 --> 00:14:39,839
determine the rate of deaths
 

849
00:14:39,839 --> 00:14:42,069
determine the rate of deaths
and we need to have a strong footing in

850
00:14:42,069 --> 00:14:42,079
and we need to have a strong footing in
 

851
00:14:42,079 --> 00:14:43,590
and we need to have a strong footing in
the number of deaths but if we assume

852
00:14:43,590 --> 00:14:43,600
the number of deaths but if we assume
 

853
00:14:43,600 --> 00:14:44,870
the number of deaths but if we assume
that the the

854
00:14:44,870 --> 00:14:44,880
that the the
 

855
00:14:44,880 --> 00:14:46,470
that the the
the number of deaths is approximately

856
00:14:46,470 --> 00:14:46,480
the number of deaths is approximately
 

857
00:14:46,480 --> 00:14:47,430
the number of deaths is approximately
correct

858
00:14:47,430 --> 00:14:47,440
correct
 

859
00:14:47,440 --> 00:14:49,590

statements
 

863
00:14:50,959 --> 00:14:53,110
statements
can we say about the deadliness of covet

864
00:14:53,110 --> 00:14:53,120
can we say about the deadliness of covet
 

865
00:14:53,120 --> 00:14:53,990
can we say about the deadliness of covet
against

866
00:14:53,990 --> 00:14:54,000
against
 

867
00:14:54,000 --> 00:14:56,870
against
across different demographics maybe not

868
00:14:56,870 --> 00:14:56,880
across different demographics maybe not
 

869
00:14:56,880 --> 00:14:58,710
across different demographics maybe not
in a political way or in the current way

870
00:14:58,710 --> 00:14:58,720
in a political way or in the current way
 

871
00:14:58,720 --> 00:15:01,110
in a political way or in the current way
but when history looks back

872
00:15:01,110 --> 00:15:01,120
but when history looks back
 

873
00:15:01,120 --> 00:15:03,269
but when history looks back
at this moment of time

874
00:15:03,269 --> 00:15:03,279
at this moment of time
 

875
00:15:03,279 --> 00:15:05,189
at this moment of time
50 years from now 100 years from now the

876
00:15:05,189 --> 00:15:05,199
50 years from now 100 years from now the
 

877
00:15:05,199 --> 00:15:07,030
50 years from now 100 years from now the
way we look at the

878
00:15:07,030 --> 00:15:07,040
way we look at the
 

879
00:15:07,040 --> 00:15:09,590
way we look at the
pandemic 100 years ago

880
00:15:09,590 --> 00:15:09,600
pandemic 100 years ago
 

881
00:15:09,600 --> 00:15:11,350
pandemic 100 years ago
what will they say about the deadliness

882
00:15:11,350 --> 00:15:11,360
what will they say about the deadliness
 

883
00:15:11,360 --> 00:15:13,750
what will they say about the deadliness
of code i mean i think the deadlines of

884
00:15:13,750 --> 00:15:13,760
of code i mean i think the deadlines of
 

885
00:15:13,760 --> 00:15:15,910
of code i mean i think the deadlines of
kova depends on not just the virus

886
00:15:15,910 --> 00:15:15,920
kova depends on not just the virus
 

887
00:15:15,920 --> 00:15:18,150
kova depends on not just the virus
itself but who who it infects

888
00:15:18,150 --> 00:15:18,160
itself but who who it infects
 

889
00:15:18,160 --> 00:15:19,590
itself but who who it infects
um so the probably the most important

890
00:15:19,590 --> 00:15:19,600
um so the probably the most important
 

891
00:15:19,600 --> 00:15:21,030
um so the probably the most important
thing about it about the deadlines of

892
00:15:21,030 --> 00:15:21,040
thing about it about the deadlines of
 

893
00:15:21,040 --> 00:15:24,389
thing about it about the deadlines of
covet is is this steep age gradient in

894
00:15:24,389 --> 00:15:24,399
covet is is this steep age gradient in
 

895
00:15:24,399 --> 00:15:27,189
covet is is this steep age gradient in
the mortality rate um so according to

896
00:15:27,189 --> 00:15:27,199
the mortality rate um so according to
 

897
00:15:27,199 --> 00:15:29,509
the mortality rate um so according to
these zero prevalence studies that that

898
00:15:29,509 --> 00:15:29,519
these zero prevalence studies that that
 

899
00:15:29,519 --> 00:15:31,910
these zero prevalence studies that that
that have been done now hundreds of them

900
00:15:31,910 --> 00:15:31,920
that have been done now hundreds of them
 

901
00:15:31,920 --> 00:15:32,790
that have been done now hundreds of them
um

902
00:15:32,790 --> 00:15:32,800
um
 

903
00:15:32,800 --> 00:15:34,389
um
mostly from before vaccination because

904
00:15:34,389 --> 00:15:34,399
mostly from before vaccination because
 

905
00:15:34,399 --> 00:15:36,069
mostly from before vaccination because
vaccination also reduces the mortality

906
00:15:36,069 --> 00:15:36,079
vaccination also reduces the mortality
 

907
00:15:36,079 --> 00:15:38,230
vaccination also reduces the mortality
risk of covid um the the sierra

908
00:15:38,230 --> 00:15:38,240
risk of covid um the the sierra
 

909
00:15:38,240 --> 00:15:40,949
risk of covid um the the sierra
prevalent studies suggest that

910
00:15:40,949 --> 00:15:40,959
prevalent studies suggest that
 

911
00:15:40,959 --> 00:15:43,110
prevalent studies suggest that
the risk of of death if you're say over

912
00:15:43,110 --> 00:15:43,120
the risk of of death if you're say over
 

913
00:15:43,120 --> 00:15:44,710
the risk of of death if you're say over
the age of 70

914
00:15:44,710 --> 00:15:44,720
the age of 70
 

915
00:15:44,720 --> 00:15:45,910
the age of 70
is

916
00:15:45,910 --> 00:15:45,920
is
 

917
00:15:45,920 --> 00:15:48,710
is
very high if you have five percent

918
00:15:48,710 --> 00:15:48,720
very high if you have five percent
 

919
00:15:48,720 --> 00:15:50,470
very high if you have five percent
if you get covered

920
00:15:50,470 --> 00:15:50,480
if you get covered
 

921
00:15:50,480 --> 00:15:52,150
if you get covered
if you're if you're under the age of 70

922
00:15:52,150 --> 00:15:52,160
if you're if you're under the age of 70
 

923
00:15:52,160 --> 00:15:53,269
if you're if you're under the age of 70
it's lower

924
00:15:53,269 --> 00:15:53,279
it's lower
 

925
00:15:53,279 --> 00:15:55,990
it's lower
0.05 but there's not a single sharp cut

926
00:15:55,990 --> 00:15:56,000
0.05 but there's not a single sharp cut
 

927
00:15:56,000 --> 00:15:57,829
0.05 but there's not a single sharp cut
off it's more like i have a rule of

928
00:15:57,829 --> 00:15:57,839
off it's more like i have a rule of
 

929
00:15:57,839 --> 00:16:01,269
off it's more like i have a rule of
thumb that i use um so if you're 50

930
00:16:01,269 --> 00:16:01,279
thumb that i use um so if you're 50
 

931
00:16:01,279 --> 00:16:03,430
thumb that i use um so if you're 50
say the infection fatality rate from

932
00:16:03,430 --> 00:16:03,440
say the infection fatality rate from
 

933
00:16:03,440 --> 00:16:04,949
say the infection fatality rate from
covalent is 0.2

934
00:16:04,949 --> 00:16:04,959
covalent is 0.2
 

935
00:16:04,959 --> 00:16:07,350
covalent is 0.2
according to the zero prevalence data

936
00:16:07,350 --> 00:16:07,360
according to the zero prevalence data
 

937
00:16:07,360 --> 00:16:10,150
according to the zero prevalence data
that means 99.8 survival

938
00:16:10,150 --> 00:16:10,160
that means 99.8 survival
 

939
00:16:10,160 --> 00:16:12,470
that means 99.8 survival
if you're 50 and for every seven years

940
00:16:12,470 --> 00:16:12,480
if you're 50 and for every seven years
 

941
00:16:12,480 --> 00:16:15,030
if you're 50 and for every seven years
of age above that double it every seven

942
00:16:15,030 --> 00:16:15,040
of age above that double it every seven
 

943
00:16:15,040 --> 00:16:17,910
of age above that double it every seven
years of age below that have it

944
00:16:17,910 --> 00:16:17,920
years of age below that have it
 

945
00:16:17,920 --> 00:16:20,790
years of age below that have it
so 57 year old have a 0.4

946
00:16:20,790 --> 00:16:20,800
so 57 year old have a 0.4
 

947
00:16:20,800 --> 00:16:22,790
so 57 year old have a 0.4
mortality a 64 year old would have a

948
00:16:22,790 --> 00:16:22,800
mortality a 64 year old would have a
 

949
00:16:22,800 --> 00:16:25,110
mortality a 64 year old would have a
point eight percent and so on and uh if

950
00:16:25,110 --> 00:16:25,120
point eight percent and so on and uh if
 

951
00:16:25,120 --> 00:16:26,870
point eight percent and so on and uh if
you have a severe chronic disease like

952
00:16:26,870 --> 00:16:26,880
you have a severe chronic disease like
 

953
00:16:26,880 --> 00:16:28,710
you have a severe chronic disease like
diabetes or if you're more morbidly

954
00:16:28,710 --> 00:16:28,720
diabetes or if you're more morbidly
 

955
00:16:28,720 --> 00:16:30,949
diabetes or if you're more morbidly
obese it's like adding seven seven years

956
00:16:30,949 --> 00:16:30,959
obese it's like adding seven seven years
 

957
00:16:30,959 --> 00:16:32,310
obese it's like adding seven seven years

delta also
 

965
00:16:38,959 --> 00:16:40,389
delta also
are there a lot of people that will be

966
00:16:40,389 --> 00:16:40,399
are there a lot of people that will be
 

967
00:16:40,399 --> 00:16:42,870
are there a lot of people that will be
listening to this with phds at the end

968
00:16:42,870 --> 00:16:42,880
listening to this with phds at the end
 

969
00:16:42,880 --> 00:16:45,030
listening to this with phds at the end
of their name that would disagree with

970
00:16:45,030 --> 00:16:45,040
of their name that would disagree with
 

971
00:16:45,040 --> 00:16:47,749
of their name that would disagree with
the 99.8 would you say so i think

972
00:16:47,749 --> 00:16:47,759
the 99.8 would you say so i think
 

973
00:16:47,759 --> 00:16:49,829
the 99.8 would you say so i think
there's some disagreement over this uh

974
00:16:49,829 --> 00:16:49,839
there's some disagreement over this uh
 

975
00:16:49,839 --> 00:16:51,430
there's some disagreement over this uh
and the disagreement

976
00:16:51,430 --> 00:16:51,440
and the disagreement
 

977
00:16:51,440 --> 00:16:53,269
and the disagreement
is about the quality of the zero

978
00:16:53,269 --> 00:16:53,279
is about the quality of the zero
 

979
00:16:53,279 --> 00:16:56,069
is about the quality of the zero
prevalence studies that were conducted

980
00:16:56,069 --> 00:16:56,079

sort of shortly after we did this
 

1017
00:17:37,679 --> 00:17:39,830
sort of shortly after we did this
and uh it had a very low false positive

1018
00:17:39,830 --> 00:17:39,840
and uh it had a very low false positive
 

1019
00:17:39,840 --> 00:17:42,070
and uh it had a very low false positive

percent of the time

1030
00:17:51,750 --> 00:17:51,760
percent of the time
 

1031
00:17:51,760 --> 00:17:55,270
percent of the time
um and uh based on studies a very large

1032
00:17:55,270 --> 00:17:55,280
um and uh based on studies a very large
 

1033
00:17:55,280 --> 00:17:56,950
um and uh based on studies a very large
number of studies looking at

1034
00:17:56,950 --> 00:17:56,960
number of studies looking at
 

1035
00:17:56,960 --> 00:17:59,270
number of studies looking at
blood from 2018 you try it against this

1036
00:17:59,270 --> 00:17:59,280
blood from 2018 you try it against this
 

1037
00:17:59,280 --> 00:18:00,470

kit

1038
00:18:00,470 --> 00:18:00,480
kit
 

1039
00:18:00,480 --> 00:18:02,230
kit
and uh you know point five percent of

1040
00:18:02,230 --> 00:18:02,240
and uh you know point five percent of
 

1041
00:18:02,240 --> 00:18:03,830
and uh you know point five percent of
the time 2018 there shouldn't be any

1042
00:18:03,830 --> 00:18:03,840
the time 2018 there shouldn't be any
 

1043
00:18:03,840 --> 00:18:06,230
the time 2018 there shouldn't be any
bodies there so for to cover if it turns

1044
00:18:06,230 --> 00:18:06,240
bodies there so for to cover if it turns
 

1045
00:18:06,240 --> 00:18:08,230
bodies there so for to cover if it turns
positive as a false positive 0.5 of the

1046
00:18:08,230 --> 00:18:08,240
positive as a false positive 0.5 of the
 

1047
00:18:08,240 --> 00:18:09,590
positive as a false positive 0.5 of the
time

1048
00:18:09,590 --> 00:18:09,600
time
 

1049
00:18:09,600 --> 00:18:11,270
time
um and then you know like a false

1050
00:18:11,270 --> 00:18:11,280
um and then you know like a false
 

1051
00:18:11,280 --> 00:18:13,750
um and then you know like a false
negative rate about 10

1052
00:18:13,750 --> 00:18:13,760
negative rate about 10
 

1053
00:18:13,760 --> 00:18:15,590
negative rate about 10
12 something like that i don't remember

1054
00:18:15,590 --> 00:18:15,600
12 something like that i don't remember
 

1055
00:18:15,600 --> 00:18:17,669
12 something like that i don't remember
the exact number but the false positive

1056
00:18:17,669 --> 00:18:17,679
the exact number but the false positive
 

1057
00:18:17,679 --> 00:18:18,789
the exact number but the false positive
rate is the important thing there right

1058
00:18:18,789 --> 00:18:18,799
rate is the important thing there right
 

1059
00:18:18,799 --> 00:18:21,430
rate is the important thing there right
so you have a population in march 2020

1060
00:18:21,430 --> 00:18:21,440
so you have a population in march 2020
 

1061
00:18:21,440 --> 00:18:23,750
so you have a population in march 2020
or april 2020 with very low

1062
00:18:23,750 --> 00:18:23,760
or april 2020 with very low
 

1063
00:18:23,760 --> 00:18:26,070
or april 2020 with very low
fraction of patients having been exposed

1064
00:18:26,070 --> 00:18:26,080
fraction of patients having been exposed
 

1065
00:18:26,080 --> 00:18:28,710
fraction of patients having been exposed
to code you don't know how much but low

1066
00:18:28,710 --> 00:18:28,720
to code you don't know how much but low
 

1067
00:18:28,720 --> 00:18:30,549
to code you don't know how much but low
even a small false positive rate could

1068
00:18:30,549 --> 00:18:30,559
even a small false positive rate could
 

1069
00:18:30,559 --> 00:18:31,909
even a small false positive rate could
end up

1070
00:18:31,909 --> 00:18:31,919
end up
 

1071
00:18:31,919 --> 00:18:34,230
end up
biasing your study quite a bit

1072
00:18:34,230 --> 00:18:34,240
biasing your study quite a bit
 

1073
00:18:34,240 --> 00:18:35,909
biasing your study quite a bit
but there's a formula to adjust for that

1074
00:18:35,909 --> 00:18:35,919
but there's a formula to adjust for that
 

1075
00:18:35,919 --> 00:18:37,350
but there's a formula to adjust for that
you can adjust for the fourth spot rate

1076
00:18:37,350 --> 00:18:37,360
you can adjust for the fourth spot rate
 

1077
00:18:37,360 --> 00:18:38,950
you can adjust for the fourth spot rate
falls negative rate we did we did that

1078
00:18:38,950 --> 00:18:38,960
falls negative rate we did we did that
 

1079
00:18:38,960 --> 00:18:42,230
falls negative rate we did we did that
adjustment and those studies found in a

1080
00:18:42,230 --> 00:18:42,240
adjustment and those studies found in a
 

1081
00:18:42,240 --> 00:18:44,070
adjustment and those studies found in a
community population so leaving aside

1082
00:18:44,070 --> 00:18:44,080
community population so leaving aside
 

1083
00:18:44,080 --> 00:18:45,350
community population so leaving aside
people in nursing homes who have a

1084
00:18:45,350 --> 00:18:45,360
people in nursing homes who have a
 

1085
00:18:45,360 --> 00:18:48,470
people in nursing homes who have a
higher death rate from covid um the that

1086
00:18:48,470 --> 00:18:48,480
higher death rate from covid um the that
 

1087
00:18:48,480 --> 00:18:50,470
higher death rate from covid um the that
the death rate was point two percent in

1088
00:18:50,470 --> 00:18:50,480
the death rate was point two percent in
 

1089
00:18:50,480 --> 00:18:51,990
the death rate was point two percent in
santa clara county

1090
00:18:51,990 --> 00:18:52,000
santa clara county
 

1091
00:18:52,000 --> 00:18:54,470
santa clara county
and in l.a county across all these

1092
00:18:54,470 --> 00:18:54,480
and in l.a county across all these
 

1093
00:18:54,480 --> 00:18:56,470
and in l.a county across all these
groups in the community community

1094
00:18:56,470 --> 00:18:56,480
groups in the community community
 

1095
00:18:56,480 --> 00:18:58,549
groups in the community community
meaning just like regular yeah so like

1096
00:18:58,549 --> 00:18:58,559
meaning just like regular yeah so like
 

1097
00:18:58,559 --> 00:18:59,590
meaning just like regular yeah so like
that that's actually a real important

1098
00:18:59,590 --> 00:18:59,600
that that's actually a real important
 

1099
00:18:59,600 --> 00:19:02,070
that that's actually a real important
question too so uh the santa clara study

1100
00:19:02,070 --> 00:19:02,080
question too so uh the santa clara study
 

1101
00:19:02,080 --> 00:19:05,190
question too so uh the santa clara study
we did this facebook sampling scheme

1102
00:19:05,190 --> 00:19:05,200
we did this facebook sampling scheme
 

1103
00:19:05,200 --> 00:19:07,669
we did this facebook sampling scheme
um which is i mean not not the ideal

1104
00:19:07,669 --> 00:19:07,679
um which is i mean not not the ideal
 

1105
00:19:07,679 --> 00:19:08,870
um which is i mean not not the ideal
thing but just like it was very

1106
00:19:08,870 --> 00:19:08,880
thing but just like it was very
 

1107
00:19:08,880 --> 00:19:11,190
thing but just like it was very
difficult to get a random sample on and

1108
00:19:11,190 --> 00:19:11,200
difficult to get a random sample on and
 

1109
00:19:11,200 --> 00:19:13,669
difficult to get a random sample on and
during the you know during lockdown

1110
00:19:13,669 --> 00:19:13,679
during the you know during lockdown
 

1111
00:19:13,679 --> 00:19:16,950
during the you know during lockdown
um where we put out uh an ad on facebook

1112
00:19:16,950 --> 00:19:16,960
um where we put out uh an ad on facebook
 

1113
00:19:16,960 --> 00:19:18,470
um where we put out uh an ad on facebook
soliciting people to

santa clara county but it tended to the

1122
00:19:26,310 --> 00:19:26,320
santa clara county but it tended to the
 

1123
00:19:26,320 --> 00:19:27,750
santa clara county but it tended to the
people who tend to volunteer were from

1124
00:19:27,750 --> 00:19:27,760
people who tend to volunteer were from
 

1125
00:19:27,760 --> 00:19:29,270
people who tend to volunteer were from
the richer parts of the county like i

1126
00:19:29,270 --> 00:19:29,280
the richer parts of the county like i
 

1127
00:19:29,280 --> 00:19:29,990
the richer parts of the county like i
had

1128
00:19:29,990 --> 00:19:30,000
had

stanford professors writing begging to
 

1131
00:19:31,520 --> 00:19:32,870
stanford professors writing begging to
be in the study because they wanted

1132
00:19:32,870 --> 00:19:32,880
be in the study because they wanted
 

1133
00:19:32,880 --> 00:19:35,190
be in the study because they wanted
antibody levels so we did some

1134
00:19:35,190 --> 00:19:35,200
antibody levels so we did some
 

1135
00:19:35,200 --> 00:19:37,270
antibody levels so we did some
adjustment for that in la county we

1136
00:19:37,270 --> 00:19:37,280
adjustment for that in la county we
 

1137
00:19:37,280 --> 00:19:40,630
adjustment for that in la county we
hired a firm that had a pre-existing

1138
00:19:40,630 --> 00:19:40,640

hired a firm that had a pre-existing
representative sample of la county

1140
00:19:42,950 --> 00:19:42,960
representative sample of la county
 

1141
00:19:42,960 --> 00:19:43,830
representative sample of la county
um

1142
00:19:43,830 --> 00:19:43,840
um
 

1143
00:19:43,840 --> 00:19:45,830
um
so but it didn't include nursing homes

1144
00:19:45,830 --> 00:19:45,840
so but it didn't include nursing homes
 

1145
00:19:45,840 --> 00:19:47,669
so but it didn't include nursing homes
it didn't include people in jail things

1146
00:19:47,669 --> 00:19:47,679
it didn't include people in jail things
 

1147
00:19:47,679 --> 00:19:48,789
it didn't include people in jail things
like that didn't include the homeless

1148
00:19:48,789 --> 00:19:48,799
like that didn't include the homeless
 

1149
00:19:48,799 --> 00:19:51,029
like that didn't include the homeless
populations so it's it's representative

1150
00:19:51,029 --> 00:19:51,039
populations so it's it's representative
 

1151
00:19:51,039 --> 00:19:53,750
populations so it's it's representative
of a community dwelling population

1152
00:19:53,750 --> 00:19:53,760
of a community dwelling population
 

1153
00:19:53,760 --> 00:19:56,870
of a community dwelling population
both of those and there we found that

1154
00:19:56,870 --> 00:19:56,880
both of those and there we found that
 

1155
00:19:56,880 --> 00:19:58,470
both of those and there we found that
both in l.a county and santa clara

1156
00:19:58,470 --> 00:19:58,480
both in l.a county and santa clara
 

1157
00:19:58,480 --> 00:20:01,510
both in l.a county and santa clara
county in april 2020 something like 40

1158
00:20:01,510 --> 00:20:01,520
county in april 2020 something like 40
 

1159
00:20:01,520 --> 00:20:05,110
county in april 2020 something like 40
to 50 times more infections than cases

1160
00:20:05,110 --> 00:20:05,120
to 50 times more infections than cases
 

1161
00:20:05,120 --> 00:20:06,630
to 50 times more infections than cases
in both places

1162
00:20:06,630 --> 00:20:06,640
in both places
 

1163
00:20:06,640 --> 00:20:09,029
in both places
so for every case that had been reported

1164
00:20:09,029 --> 00:20:09,039
so for every case that had been reported
 

1165
00:20:09,039 --> 00:20:10,950
so for every case that had been reported
to the public health authorities we

1166
00:20:10,950 --> 00:20:10,960
to the public health authorities we
 

1167
00:20:10,960 --> 00:20:14,230
to the public health authorities we
found that you know you know 40 or 50

1168
00:20:14,230 --> 00:20:14,240
found that you know you know 40 or 50
 

1169
00:20:14,240 --> 00:20:16,630
found that you know you know 40 or 50

that suggested that they'd had coveted
 

1175
00:20:19,520 --> 00:20:21,430
that suggested that they'd had coveted
recovered so people were not reporting

1176
00:20:21,430 --> 00:20:21,440
recovered so people were not reporting
 

1177
00:20:21,440 --> 00:20:24,070
recovered so people were not reporting
or severe at least in those days under

00:20:24,070 --> 00:20:24,080
or severe at least in those days under
 

1179
00:20:24,080 --> 00:20:25,909
or severe at least in those days under
reporting yeah i mean there was you know

1180
00:20:25,909 --> 00:20:25,919
reporting yeah i mean there was you know
 

1181
00:20:25,919 --> 00:20:27,350

there's testing problems there weren't

1182
00:20:27,350 --> 00:20:27,360
there's testing problems there weren't
 

1183
00:20:27,360 --> 00:20:29,750
there's testing problems there weren't
so many tests available people didn't

1184
00:20:29,750 --> 00:20:29,760
so many tests available people didn't
 

1185
00:20:29,760 --> 00:20:31,909
so many tests available people didn't
know a lot of a lot of them we asked a

1186
00:20:31,909 --> 00:20:31,919
know a lot of a lot of them we asked a
 

1187
00:20:31,919 --> 00:20:33,270
know a lot of a lot of them we asked a
set of questions about the symptoms

1188
00:20:33,270 --> 00:20:33,280
set of questions about the symptoms
 

1189
00:20:33,280 --> 00:20:34,630
set of questions about the symptoms
they've faced

1190
00:20:34,630 --> 00:20:34,640
they've faced
 

1191
00:20:34,640 --> 00:20:35,830
they've faced
and most of them said they faced no

1192
00:20:35,830 --> 00:20:35,840
and most of them said they faced no
 

1193
00:20:35,840 --> 00:20:37,990
and most of them said they faced no
symptoms or the most uh 30 40 of them

00:20:37,990 --> 00:20:38,000
symptoms or the most uh 30 40 of them
 

1195

said face their no symptoms
 

1197
00:20:40,640 --> 00:20:42,390
said face their no symptoms
and i mean even these days how many

1198
00:20:42,390 --> 00:20:42,400
and i mean even these days how many
 

1199
00:20:42,400 --> 00:20:44,230
and i mean even these days how many
people report that they get covered when

1200
00:20:44,230 --> 00:20:44,240
people report that they get covered when
 

1201
00:20:44,240 --> 00:20:46,310
people report that they get covered when
they get covered okay i'll have those

1202
00:20:46,310 --> 00:20:46,320
they get covered okay i'll have those
 

1203
00:20:46,320 --> 00:20:47,430

um and uh uh what he found was that that

00:21:10,549 --> 00:21:10,559
um and uh uh what he found was that that
 

1227
00:21:10,559 --> 00:21:12,470
um and uh uh what he found was that that
point two percent is roughly the

00:21:12,470 --> 00:21:12,480
point two percent is roughly the
 

1229
00:21:12,480 --> 00:21:14,470
point two percent is roughly the
worldwide number in fact i think he

1230
00:21:14,470 --> 00:21:14,480
worldwide number in fact i think he
 

1231
00:21:14,480 --> 00:21:17,270
worldwide number in fact i think he
cites this lower number 0.15 percent

1232
00:21:17,270 --> 00:21:17,280
cites this lower number 0.15 percent
 

1233
00:21:17,280 --> 00:21:19,350
cites this lower number 0.15 percent
as the median infection fatality rate

1234
00:21:19,350 --> 00:21:19,360
as the median infection fatality rate

1237
00:21:20,559 --> 00:21:22,789
worldwide
so we did these studies and it generated

1238
00:21:22,789 --> 00:21:22,799
so we did these studies and it generated
 

1239
00:21:22,799 --> 00:21:25,110
so we did these studies and it generated
an enormous amount of blowback

1240
00:21:25,110 --> 00:21:25,120
an enormous amount of blowback
 

1241
00:21:25,120 --> 00:21:26,870
an enormous amount of blowback
by people who thought that the infection

1242
00:21:26,870 --> 00:21:26,880
by people who thought that the infection
 

1243
00:21:26,880 --> 00:21:28,310
by people who thought that the infection
rate is much higher

1244
00:21:28,310 --> 00:21:28,320
rate is much higher
 

1245
00:21:28,320 --> 00:21:29,909
rate is much higher
and there's some controversy over the

1246
00:21:29,909 --> 00:21:29,919
and there's some controversy over the
 

1247
00:21:29,919 --> 00:21:31,430
and there's some controversy over the
quality of some of the other studies

1248
00:21:31,430 --> 00:21:31,440
quality of some of the other studies
 

1249
00:21:31,440 --> 00:21:33,270
quality of some of the other studies
that that are done and so there are some

1250
00:21:33,270 --> 00:21:33,280
that that are done and so there are some
 

1251
00:21:33,280 --> 00:21:35,430
that that are done and so there are some
people who look at this same literature

1252
00:21:35,430 --> 00:21:35,440
people who look at this same literature
 

1253
00:21:35,440 --> 00:21:37,430
people who look at this same literature
and say well the the lower quality

1254
00:21:37,430 --> 00:21:37,440
and say well the the lower quality
 

1255
00:21:37,440 --> 00:21:39,590
and say well the the lower quality
studies tend to have lower ifrs

1256
00:21:39,590 --> 00:21:39,600
studies tend to have lower ifrs
 

1257
00:21:39,600 --> 00:21:41,350
studies tend to have lower ifrs
the higher quality studies how far oh

1258
00:21:41,350 --> 00:21:41,360

00:22:23,760 --> 00:22:26,630
like new york city the infection
fatality rate is is much higher

1298
00:22:26,630 --> 00:22:26,640
fatality rate is is much higher
 

1299
00:22:26,640 --> 00:22:29,029
fatality rate is is much higher
it's there's a range of ifrs not a

1300
00:22:29,029 --> 00:22:29,039
it's there's a range of ifrs not a
 

1301
00:22:29,039 --> 00:22:30,710
it's there's a range of ifrs not a
single number

1302
00:22:30,710 --> 00:22:30,720
single number
 

1303
00:22:30,720 --> 00:22:32,710
single number
this sometimes surprises people because

1304
00:22:32,710 --> 00:22:32,720
this sometimes surprises people because
 

1305
00:22:32,720 --> 00:22:34,149
this sometimes surprises people because
they think well it's a it's a virus it

1306
00:22:34,149 --> 00:22:34,159
they think well it's a it's a virus it
 

1307
00:22:34,159 --> 00:22:35,270
they think well it's a it's a virus it
should have the same properties no

1308
00:22:35,270 --> 00:22:35,280
should have the same properties no
 

1309
00:22:35,280 --> 00:22:36,630
should have the same properties no
matter where it goes

1310
00:22:36,630 --> 00:22:36,640
matter where it goes
 

1311
00:22:36,640 --> 00:22:39,350
matter where it goes
but the virus

1312
00:22:39,350 --> 00:22:39,360
but the virus
 

1313
00:22:39,360 --> 00:22:42,950
but the virus
kills or infects or hurts in interaction

1314
00:22:42,950 --> 00:22:42,960
kills or infects or hurts in interaction
 

1315
00:22:42,960 --> 00:22:44,630
kills or infects or hurts in interaction
with the host

1316
00:22:44,630 --> 00:22:44,640
with the host
 

1317
00:22:44,640 --> 00:22:46,630
with the host
and the properties of both the host and

1318
00:22:46,630 --> 00:22:46,640
and the properties of both the host and
 

1319
00:22:46,640 --> 00:22:47,750
and the properties of both the host and
the virus

1320
00:22:47,750 --> 00:22:47,760
the virus
 

1321
00:22:47,760 --> 00:22:50,310
the virus
combine to produce the the outcome but

1322
00:22:50,310 --> 00:22:50,320
combine to produce the the outcome but
 

1323
00:22:50,320 --> 00:22:52,870
combine to produce the the outcome but
you also mentioned the environment too

1324
00:22:52,870 --> 00:22:52,880
you also mentioned the environment too
 

1325
00:22:52,880 --> 00:22:54,710
you also mentioned the environment too
well it's i'm thinking mainly just about

1326
00:22:54,710 --> 00:22:54,720
well it's i'm thinking mainly just about
 

1327
00:22:54,720 --> 00:22:56,310
well it's i'm thinking mainly just about
the the person like if i'm gonna think

1328
00:22:56,310 --> 00:22:56,320
the the person like if i'm gonna think
 

1329
00:22:56,320 --> 00:22:57,669
the the person like if i'm gonna think
about it like the most simplest way to

1330
00:22:57,669 --> 00:22:57,679
about it like the most simplest way to
 

1331
00:22:57,679 --> 00:22:59,430
about it like the most simplest way to
think about it is age age is the single

1332
00:22:59,430 --> 00:22:59,440
think about it is age age is the single
 

1333
00:22:59,440 --> 00:23:01,190
think about it is age age is the single
most important risk factor

1334
00:23:01,190 --> 00:23:01,200
most important risk factor
 

1335
00:23:01,200 --> 00:23:03,510
most important risk factor
so older places are going to have a

1336
00:23:03,510 --> 00:23:03,520
so older places are going to have a
 

1337
00:23:03,520 --> 00:23:05,909
so older places are going to have a
higher ifr

1338
00:23:05,909 --> 00:23:05,919
higher ifr
 

1339
00:23:05,919 --> 00:23:08,070
higher ifr
than younger places africa three percent

1340
00:23:08,070 --> 00:23:08,080
than younger places africa three percent
 

1341
00:23:08,080 --> 00:23:10,950
than younger places africa three percent
of africa is over 65. so in some sense

1342
00:23:10,950 --> 00:23:10,960
of africa is over 65. so in some sense
 

1343
00:23:10,960 --> 00:23:14,149
of africa is over 65. so in some sense
it's not surprising that they have a low

1344
00:23:14,149 --> 00:23:14,159
it's not surprising that they have a low
 

1345
00:23:14,159 --> 00:23:15,990
it's not surprising that they have a low
infection fatality rate so that's one

1346
00:23:15,990 --> 00:23:16,000
infection fatality rate so that's one
 

1347
00:23:16,000 --> 00:23:17,190
infection fatality rate so that's one
way you would explain the difference

1348
00:23:17,190 --> 00:23:17,200
way you would explain the difference
 

1349
00:23:17,200 --> 00:23:18,950
way you would explain the difference
between africa and new york city in

1350
00:23:18,950 --> 00:23:18,960
between africa and new york city in
 

1351
00:23:18,960 --> 00:23:21,110
between africa and new york city in
terms of the fatality rate is the age

1352
00:23:21,110 --> 00:23:21,120
terms of the fatality rate is the age
 

1353
00:23:21,120 --> 00:23:23,110
terms of the fatality rate is the age
the average age yeah and especially in

1354
00:23:23,110 --> 00:23:23,120
the average age yeah and especially in
 

1355
00:23:23,120 --> 00:23:25,510
the average age yeah and especially in
the early days of the epidemic in new

1356
00:23:25,510 --> 00:23:25,520
the early days of the epidemic in new
 

1357
00:23:25,520 --> 00:23:26,789
the early days of the epidemic in new
york city

1358
00:23:26,789 --> 00:23:26,799
york city
 

1359
00:23:26,799 --> 00:23:27,669
york city
the

1360
00:23:27,669 --> 00:23:27,679
the
 

1361
00:23:27,679 --> 00:23:28,470
the
uh

1362
00:23:28,470 --> 00:23:28,480
uh
 

1363
00:23:28,480 --> 00:23:30,710
uh
older populations living in nursing

1364
00:23:30,710 --> 00:23:30,720
older populations living in nursing
 

1365
00:23:30,720 --> 00:23:33,270
older populations living in nursing
homes were differentially infected

1366
00:23:33,270 --> 00:23:33,280
homes were differentially infected
 

1367
00:23:33,280 --> 00:23:34,950
homes were differentially infected
based on because of policies that were

1368
00:23:34,950 --> 00:23:34,960
based on because of policies that were
 

1369
00:23:34,960 --> 00:23:36,950
based on because of policies that were
adopted right to send

1370
00:23:36,950 --> 00:23:36,960
adopted right to send
 

1371
00:23:36,960 --> 00:23:38,310
adopted right to send
coveted infected patients back to

1372
00:23:38,310 --> 00:23:38,320
coveted infected patients back to
 

1373
00:23:38,320 --> 00:23:40,149
coveted infected patients back to
nursing homes to keep hospitals empty

1374
00:23:40,149 --> 00:23:40,159
nursing homes to keep hospitals empty
 

1375
00:23:40,159 --> 00:23:41,669
nursing homes to keep hospitals empty
what do you mean by differentially

1376
00:23:41,669 --> 00:23:41,679
what do you mean by differentially
 

1377
00:23:41,679 --> 00:23:42,789
what do you mean by differentially
infected

1378
00:23:42,789 --> 00:23:42,799
infected
 

1379
00:23:42,799 --> 00:23:45,990
infected
the policy that you adopt determines who

1380
00:23:45,990 --> 00:23:46,000
the policy that you adopt determines who
 

1381
00:23:46,000 --> 00:23:48,470
the policy that you adopt determines who
is most exposed right that okay so

1382
00:23:48,470 --> 00:23:48,480
is most exposed right that okay so
 

1383
00:23:48,480 --> 00:23:51,350
is most exposed right that okay so
that's what the policy it's the person

1384
00:23:51,350 --> 00:23:51,360
that's what the policy it's the person
 

1385
00:23:51,360 --> 00:23:52,630
that's what the policy it's the person
that matters

1386
00:23:52,630 --> 00:23:52,640
that matters
 

1387
00:23:52,640 --> 00:23:54,710
that matters
i mean it's not like the virus just kind

1388
00:23:54,710 --> 00:23:54,720
i mean it's not like the virus just kind
 

1389
00:23:54,720 --> 00:23:57,190
i mean it's not like the virus just kind
of it doesn't care i mean the policy

1390
00:23:57,190 --> 00:23:57,200
of it doesn't care i mean the policy
 

1391
00:23:57,200 --> 00:23:59,190
of it doesn't care i mean the policy
determines the nature of the interaction

1392
00:23:59,190 --> 00:23:59,200
determines the nature of the interaction
 

1393
00:23:59,200 --> 00:24:00,870
determines the nature of the interaction
and there's also i mean there is some

1394
00:24:00,870 --> 00:24:00,880
and there's also i mean there is some
 

1395
00:24:00,880 --> 00:24:02,830
and there's also i mean there is some
contribution from the

1396
00:24:02,830 --> 00:24:02,840
contribution from the
 

1397
00:24:02,840 --> 00:24:04,950
contribution from the
environment different regions have

1398
00:24:04,950 --> 00:24:04,960
environment different regions have
 

1399
00:24:04,960 --> 00:24:07,510
environment different regions have
different proximity maybe of people

1400
00:24:07,510 --> 00:24:07,520
different proximity maybe of people
 

1401
00:24:07,520 --> 00:24:09,269
different proximity maybe of people
interacting or the dynamics of the way

1402
00:24:09,269 --> 00:24:09,279
interacting or the dynamics of the way
 

1403
00:24:09,279 --> 00:24:10,710
interacting or the dynamics of the way
they interact

1404
00:24:10,710 --> 00:24:10,720
they interact
 

1405
00:24:10,720 --> 00:24:12,070
they interact
like if you have a if you have

1406
00:24:12,070 --> 00:24:12,080
like if you have a if you have
 

1407
00:24:12,080 --> 00:24:13,350
like if you have a if you have
situations where there's lots of

1408
00:24:13,350 --> 00:24:13,360
situations where there's lots of
 

1409
00:24:13,360 --> 00:24:15,110
situations where there's lots of
intergenerational

1410
00:24:15,110 --> 00:24:15,120
intergenerational
 

1411
00:24:15,120 --> 00:24:17,750
intergenerational
uh interactions yeah then you have a

1412
00:24:17,750 --> 00:24:17,760
uh interactions yeah then you have a
 

1413
00:24:17,760 --> 00:24:19,990
uh interactions yeah then you have a
very different risk profile than if than

1414
00:24:19,990 --> 00:24:20,000
very different risk profile than if than
 

1415
00:24:20,000 --> 00:24:22,230
very different risk profile than if than
if you have societies that are where

1416
00:24:22,230 --> 00:24:22,240
if you have societies that are where
 

1417
00:24:22,240 --> 00:24:23,669
if you have societies that are where
generations are more separate from one

1418
00:24:23,669 --> 00:24:23,679
generations are more separate from one
 

1419
00:24:23,679 --> 00:24:24,630
generations are more separate from one
another

1420
00:24:24,630 --> 00:24:24,640
another
 

1421
00:24:24,640 --> 00:24:25,669
another
um

1422
00:24:25,669 --> 00:24:25,679
um
 

1423
00:24:25,679 --> 00:24:27,190
um
okay so let me just finish real fast

1424
00:24:27,190 --> 00:24:27,200
okay so let me just finish real fast
 

1425
00:24:27,200 --> 00:24:30,230
okay so let me just finish real fast
about this so you you have in new york

1426
00:24:30,230 --> 00:24:30,240
about this so you you have in new york
 

1427
00:24:30,240 --> 00:24:33,350
about this so you you have in new york
you have a population that was infected

1428
00:24:33,350 --> 00:24:33,360
you have a population that was infected
 

1429
00:24:33,360 --> 00:24:34,950
you have a population that was infected
in the early days that was

1430
00:24:34,950 --> 00:24:34,960
in the early days that was
 

1431
00:24:34,960 --> 00:24:37,510
in the early days that was
very likely going to die but had a much

1432
00:24:37,510 --> 00:24:37,520
very likely going to die but had a much
 

1433
00:24:37,520 --> 00:24:39,990
very likely going to die but had a much
higher likelihood of dying if infected

1434
00:24:39,990 --> 00:24:40,000
higher likelihood of dying if infected
 

1435
00:24:40,000 --> 00:24:43,029
higher likelihood of dying if infected
and so new york city had a higher ifr

1436
00:24:43,029 --> 00:24:43,039
and so new york city had a higher ifr
 

1437
00:24:43,039 --> 00:24:45,350
and so new york city had a higher ifr
especially in the early days than um

1438
00:24:45,350 --> 00:24:45,360
especially in the early days than um
 

1439
00:24:45,360 --> 00:24:48,789
especially in the early days than um
than um then like africa has had

1440
00:24:48,789 --> 00:24:48,799
than um then like africa has had
 

1441
00:24:48,799 --> 00:24:51,430
than um then like africa has had
um the other thing is treatment right so

1442
00:24:51,430 --> 00:24:51,440
um the other thing is treatment right so
 

1443
00:24:51,440 --> 00:24:52,950
um the other thing is treatment right so
the treatments that we adopted in the

1444
00:24:52,950 --> 00:24:52,960
the treatments that we adopted in the
 

1445
00:24:52,960 --> 00:24:54,549
the treatments that we adopted in the
early days the epidemic i think actually

1446
00:24:54,549 --> 00:24:54,559
early days the epidemic i think actually
 

1447
00:24:54,559 --> 00:24:58,390
early days the epidemic i think actually
may have exacerbated the risk of death

1448
00:24:58,390 --> 00:24:58,400
may have exacerbated the risk of death
 

1449
00:24:58,400 --> 00:24:59,990
may have exacerbated the risk of death
which do so like

1450
00:24:59,990 --> 00:25:00,000
which do so like
 

1451
00:25:00,000 --> 00:25:01,990
which do so like
using ventilators like the the over

1452
00:25:01,990 --> 00:25:02,000
using ventilators like the the over
 

1453
00:25:02,000 --> 00:25:03,669
using ventilators like the the over
reliance on ventilators is what i'm

1454
00:25:03,669 --> 00:25:03,679
reliance on ventilators is what i'm
 

1455
00:25:03,679 --> 00:25:04,950
reliance on ventilators is what i'm
primarily thinking of but i can think of

1456
00:25:04,950 --> 00:25:04,960
primarily thinking of but i can think of
 

1457
00:25:04,960 --> 00:25:05,990
primarily thinking of but i can think of
other things

1458
00:25:05,990 --> 00:25:06,000
other things
 

1459
00:25:06,000 --> 00:25:08,950
other things
um but that that uh also we've learned

1460
00:25:08,950 --> 00:25:08,960
um but that that uh also we've learned
 

1461
00:25:08,960 --> 00:25:11,190
um but that that uh also we've learned
over time how better to manage patients

1462
00:25:11,190 --> 00:25:11,200
over time how better to manage patients
 

1463
00:25:11,200 --> 00:25:12,630
over time how better to manage patients
with the disease

1464
00:25:12,630 --> 00:25:12,640
with the disease
 

1465
00:25:12,640 --> 00:25:13,909
with the disease
so you have those you have all those

1466
00:25:13,909 --> 00:25:13,919
so you have those you have all those
 

1467
00:25:13,919 --> 00:25:15,830
so you have those you have all those
things combined so that's that's where

1468
00:25:15,830 --> 00:25:15,840
things combined so that's that's where
 

1469
00:25:15,840 --> 00:25:17,350
things combined so that's that's where
the controversy over this over this

1470
00:25:17,350 --> 00:25:17,360
the controversy over this over this
 

1471
00:25:17,360 --> 00:25:19,110
the controversy over this over this
number is i mean

1472
00:25:19,110 --> 00:25:19,120
number is i mean
 

1473
00:25:19,120 --> 00:25:20,870
number is i mean
new york city

1474
00:25:20,870 --> 00:25:20,880
new york city
 

1475
00:25:20,880 --> 00:25:24,149
new york city
also it has a is a central hub for those

1476
00:25:24,149 --> 00:25:24,159
also it has a is a central hub for those
 

1477
00:25:24,159 --> 00:25:25,669
also it has a is a central hub for those
who tweet

1478
00:25:25,669 --> 00:25:25,679
who tweet
 

1479
00:25:25,679 --> 00:25:29,029
who tweet
and uh those who write powerful stories

1480
00:25:29,029 --> 00:25:29,039
and uh those who write powerful stories
 

1481
00:25:29,039 --> 00:25:31,669
and uh those who write powerful stories
and narratives in article form

1482
00:25:31,669 --> 00:25:31,679
and narratives in article form
 

1483
00:25:31,679 --> 00:25:34,070
and narratives in article form
and i remember those quite dramatic

1484
00:25:34,070 --> 00:25:34,080
and i remember those quite dramatic
 

1485
00:25:34,080 --> 00:25:35,830
and i remember those quite dramatic
stories about sort of doctors in the

1486
00:25:35,830 --> 00:25:35,840
stories about sort of doctors in the
 

1487
00:25:35,840 --> 00:25:37,350
stories about sort of doctors in the
hospitals and these kinds of things i

1488
00:25:37,350 --> 00:25:37,360
hospitals and these kinds of things i
 

1489
00:25:37,360 --> 00:25:40,470
hospitals and these kinds of things i
mean there's very serious very dramatic

1490
00:25:40,470 --> 00:25:40,480
mean there's very serious very dramatic
 

1491
00:25:40,480 --> 00:25:43,750
mean there's very serious very dramatic
very tragic deaths going on always in

1492
00:25:43,750 --> 00:25:43,760
very tragic deaths going on always in
 

1493
00:25:43,760 --> 00:25:46,710
very tragic deaths going on always in
hospitals those stories

1494
00:25:46,710 --> 00:25:46,720
hospitals those stories
 

1495
00:25:46,720 --> 00:25:47,750
hospitals those stories
um

1496
00:25:47,750 --> 00:25:47,760
um
 

1497
00:25:47,760 --> 00:25:50,149
um
a lot of loved ones losing each other on

1498
00:25:50,149 --> 00:25:50,159
a lot of loved ones losing each other on
 

1499
00:25:50,159 --> 00:25:52,390
a lot of loved ones losing each other on
a deathbed that's always tragic and you

1500
00:25:52,390 --> 00:25:52,400
a deathbed that's always tragic and you
 

1501
00:25:52,400 --> 00:25:54,549
a deathbed that's always tragic and you
can always write a hell of a good story

1502
00:25:54,549 --> 00:25:54,559
can always write a hell of a good story
 

1503
00:25:54,559 --> 00:25:57,029
can always write a hell of a good story
about that and you should about the loss

1504
00:25:57,029 --> 00:25:57,039
about that and you should about the loss
 

1505
00:25:57,039 --> 00:25:59,350
about that and you should about the loss
of loved ones but they were doing it

1506
00:25:59,350 --> 00:25:59,360
of loved ones but they were doing it
 

1507
00:25:59,360 --> 00:26:01,990
of loved ones but they were doing it
pretty pretty well i would say um over

1508
00:26:01,990 --> 00:26:02,000
pretty pretty well i would say um over
 

1509
00:26:02,000 --> 00:26:04,710
pretty pretty well i would say um over
this kind of dramatic deaths and so in

1510
00:26:04,710 --> 00:26:04,720
this kind of dramatic deaths and so in
 

1511
00:26:04,720 --> 00:26:07,510
this kind of dramatic deaths and so in
response to that it's very

1512
00:26:07,510 --> 00:26:07,520
response to that it's very
 

1513
00:26:07,520 --> 00:26:10,149
response to that it's very
unpleasant to hear even to consider the

1514
00:26:10,149 --> 00:26:10,159
unpleasant to hear even to consider the
 

1515
00:26:10,159 --> 00:26:11,909
unpleasant to hear even to consider the
possibility that

1516
00:26:11,909 --> 00:26:11,919
possibility that
 

1517
00:26:11,919 --> 00:26:14,950
possibility that
the death rate is not as high as you

1518
00:26:14,950 --> 00:26:14,960
the death rate is not as high as you
 

1519
00:26:14,960 --> 00:26:18,149
the death rate is not as high as you
might otherwise as you might feel yeah i

1520
00:26:18,149 --> 00:26:18,159
might otherwise as you might feel yeah i
 

1521
00:26:18,159 --> 00:26:20,470
might otherwise as you might feel yeah i
was surprised by the reaction

1522
00:26:20,470 --> 00:26:20,480
was surprised by the reaction
 

1523
00:26:20,480 --> 00:26:22,710
was surprised by the reaction
both by regular people and also the

1524
00:26:22,710 --> 00:26:22,720
both by regular people and also the
 

1525
00:26:22,720 --> 00:26:24,710
both by regular people and also the
scientific community in response to

1526
00:26:24,710 --> 00:26:24,720
scientific community in response to
 

1527
00:26:24,720 --> 00:26:26,470
scientific community in response to
those studies those early studies in

1528
00:26:26,470 --> 00:26:26,480
those studies those early studies in
 

1529
00:26:26,480 --> 00:26:30,070
those studies those early studies in
april of 2020 um uh to me they uh they

1530
00:26:30,070 --> 00:26:30,080
april of 2020 um uh to me they uh they
 

1531
00:26:30,080 --> 00:26:32,070
april of 2020 um uh to me they uh they
were there were studies i mean they're

1532
00:26:32,070 --> 00:26:32,080
were there were studies i mean they're
 

1533
00:26:32,080 --> 00:26:34,149
were there were studies i mean they're
they're the kinds of not exactly the

1534
00:26:34,149 --> 00:26:34,159
they're the kinds of not exactly the
 

1535
00:26:34,159 --> 00:26:35,430
they're the kinds of not exactly the
kinds of work i've worked on all my life

1536
00:26:35,430 --> 00:26:35,440
kinds of work i've worked on all my life
 

1537
00:26:35,440 --> 00:26:37,190
kinds of work i've worked on all my life
but it's kind of kind of like the kind

1538
00:26:37,190 --> 00:26:37,200
but it's kind of kind of like the kind
 

1539
00:26:37,200 --> 00:26:39,590
but it's kind of kind of like the kind
of you know like you you write a paper

1540
00:26:39,590 --> 00:26:39,600
of you know like you you write a paper
 

1541
00:26:39,600 --> 00:26:41,909
of you know like you you write a paper
and you get response responses from your

1542
00:26:41,909 --> 00:26:41,919
and you get response responses from your
 

1543
00:26:41,919 --> 00:26:43,590
and you get response responses from your
fellow scientists and you you know

1544
00:26:43,590 --> 00:26:43,600
fellow scientists and you you know
 

1545
00:26:43,600 --> 00:26:45,029
fellow scientists and you you know
change the paper to improve it uh you

1546
00:26:45,029 --> 00:26:45,039
change the paper to improve it uh you
 

1547
00:26:45,039 --> 00:26:47,110
change the paper to improve it uh you
have hopefully learned something from it

1548
00:26:47,110 --> 00:26:47,120
have hopefully learned something from it
 

1549
00:26:47,120 --> 00:26:50,310
have hopefully learned something from it
well but to push back it's just a study

1550
00:26:50,310 --> 00:26:50,320
well but to push back it's just a study
 

1551
00:26:50,320 --> 00:26:52,070
well but to push back it's just a study
but there's some studies and this is

1552
00:26:52,070 --> 00:26:52,080
but there's some studies and this is
 

1553
00:26:52,080 --> 00:26:54,149
but there's some studies and this is
kind of interesting because i've

1554
00:26:54,149 --> 00:26:54,159
kind of interesting because i've
 

1555
00:26:54,159 --> 00:26:56,390
kind of interesting because i've
received similar pushback on other

1556
00:26:56,390 --> 00:26:56,400
received similar pushback on other
 

1557
00:26:56,400 --> 00:26:59,350
received similar pushback on other
topics

1558
00:26:59,350 --> 00:26:59,360

 

1559
00:26:59,360 --> 00:27:00,390

there's

1560
00:27:00,390 --> 00:27:00,400
there's
 

1561
00:27:00,400 --> 00:27:02,470
there's
some studies that

1562
00:27:02,470 --> 00:27:02,480
some studies that
 

1563
00:27:02,480 --> 00:27:03,510
some studies that
if

1564
00:27:03,510 --> 00:27:03,520
if
 

1565
00:27:03,520 --> 00:27:07,750
if
wrong might have a wide ranging uh

1566
00:27:07,750 --> 00:27:07,760
wrong might have a wide ranging uh
 

1567
00:27:07,760 --> 00:27:09,990
wrong might have a wide ranging uh
detrimental effects on society so that's

1568
00:27:09,990 --> 00:27:10,000
detrimental effects on society so that's
 

1569
00:27:10,000 --> 00:27:11,350
detrimental effects on society so that's
that that's the way they would perceive

1570
00:27:11,350 --> 00:27:11,360
that that's the way they would perceive
 

1571
00:27:11,360 --> 00:27:13,110
that that's the way they would perceive
the studies if you say the death rate is

1572
00:27:13,110 --> 00:27:13,120
the studies if you say the death rate is
 

1573
00:27:13,120 --> 00:27:15,990
the studies if you say the death rate is
lower and you end up as you often do in

1574
00:27:15,990 --> 00:27:16,000
lower and you end up as you often do in
 

1575
00:27:16,000 --> 00:27:18,070
lower and you end up as you often do in
science realizing that nope that that

1576
00:27:18,070 --> 00:27:18,080
science realizing that nope that that
 

1577
00:27:18,080 --> 00:27:20,070
science realizing that nope that that
was there was a flaw in the way the

1578
00:27:20,070 --> 00:27:20,080
was there was a flaw in the way the
 

1579
00:27:20,080 --> 00:27:21,990
was there was a flaw in the way the
study was conducted or were just not

1580
00:27:21,990 --> 00:27:22,000
study was conducted or were just not
 

1581
00:27:22,000 --> 00:27:23,909
study was conducted or were just not
representative of a broader population

1582
00:27:23,909 --> 00:27:23,919
representative of a broader population
 

1583
00:27:23,919 --> 00:27:25,350
representative of a broader population
and then you realize the death rate is

1584
00:27:25,350 --> 00:27:25,360
and then you realize the death rate is
 

1585
00:27:25,360 --> 00:27:27,590
and then you realize the death rate is
much higher that might be very damaging

1586
00:27:27,590 --> 00:27:27,600
much higher that might be very damaging
 

1587
00:27:27,600 --> 00:27:30,470
much higher that might be very damaging
in in people's view uh so so that's

1588
00:27:30,470 --> 00:27:30,480
in in people's view uh so so that's
 

1589
00:27:30,480 --> 00:27:31,669
in in people's view uh so so that's
probably

1590
00:27:31,669 --> 00:27:31,679
probably
 

1591
00:27:31,679 --> 00:27:33,830
probably
where the scientific community sort of

1592
00:27:33,830 --> 00:27:33,840
where the scientific community sort of
 

1593
00:27:33,840 --> 00:27:37,269
where the scientific community sort of
just steal man the kind of response is

1594
00:27:37,269 --> 00:27:37,279
just steal man the kind of response is
 

1595
00:27:37,279 --> 00:27:39,909
just steal man the kind of response is
that's where they felt like you know

1596
00:27:39,909 --> 00:27:39,919
that's where they felt like you know
 

1597
00:27:39,919 --> 00:27:41,909
that's where they felt like you know
there's some findings where you better

1598
00:27:41,909 --> 00:27:41,919
there's some findings where you better
 

1599
00:27:41,919 --> 00:27:44,870
there's some findings where you better
be damn sure before you kind of report

1600
00:27:44,870 --> 00:27:44,880
be damn sure before you kind of report
 

1601
00:27:44,880 --> 00:27:45,669
be damn sure before you kind of report
them

1602
00:27:45,669 --> 00:27:45,679
them
 

1603
00:27:45,679 --> 00:27:47,029
them
yeah i mean we were pretty sure we were

1604
00:27:47,029 --> 00:27:47,039
yeah i mean we were pretty sure we were
 

1605
00:27:47,039 --> 00:27:48,470
yeah i mean we were pretty sure we were
right and it turns out we were right so

1606
00:27:48,470 --> 00:27:48,480
right and it turns out we were right so
 

1607
00:27:48,480 --> 00:27:50,789
right and it turns out we were right so
like when we so um

1608
00:27:50,789 --> 00:27:50,799
like when we so um
 

1609
00:27:50,799 --> 00:27:54,149
like when we so um
we released the the santa clara study

1610
00:27:54,149 --> 00:27:54,159
we released the the santa clara study
 

1611
00:27:54,159 --> 00:27:56,789
we released the the santa clara study
via this open open science process and

1612
00:27:56,789 --> 00:27:56,799
via this open open science process and

1614
00:27:59,110 --> 00:27:59,120
this uh server called med med archive
 

1615
00:27:59,120 --> 00:28:02,070
this uh server called med med archive
it's it's designed for releasing studies

1616
00:28:02,070 --> 00:28:02,080

the the reason was that we felt we had

the the reason was that we felt we had
 

1643
00:28:26,960 --> 00:28:29,909
the the reason was that we felt we had
an obligation we had a result that was

an obligation we had a result that was
 

1645
00:28:29,919 --> 00:28:31,750
an obligation we had a result that was
we thought was quite important

1646
00:28:31,750 --> 00:28:31,760
we thought was quite important
 

1647
00:28:31,760 --> 00:28:34,070
we thought was quite important
and we wanted to tell the scientific

1648
00:28:34,070 --> 00:28:34,080
and we wanted to tell the scientific
 

1649
00:28:34,080 --> 00:28:35,510
and we wanted to tell the scientific
community about it and also tell the

1650
00:28:35,510 --> 00:28:35,520
community about it and also tell the
 

1651
00:28:35,520 --> 00:28:36,630
community about it and also tell the
world about it

1652
00:28:36,630 --> 00:28:36,640
world about it
 

1653
00:28:36,640 --> 00:28:37,990
world about it
and it wasn't we wanted to get feedback

1654
00:28:37,990 --> 00:28:38,000
and it wasn't we wanted to get feedback
 

1655
00:28:38,000 --> 00:28:39,830
and it wasn't we wanted to get feedback
i mean that's part of the purpose of

1656
00:28:39,830 --> 00:28:39,840
i mean that's part of the purpose of
 

1657
00:28:39,840 --> 00:28:42,149
i mean that's part of the purpose of
sending it to these kinds of places

1658
00:28:42,149 --> 00:28:42,159
sending it to these kinds of places
 

1659
00:28:42,159 --> 00:28:45,029
sending it to these kinds of places
i think a lot of the problem is that

1660
00:28:45,029 --> 00:28:45,039
i think a lot of the problem is that
 

1661
00:28:45,039 --> 00:28:46,950
i think a lot of the problem is that
uh when people think about published

1662
00:28:46,950 --> 00:28:46,960
uh when people think about published
 

1663
00:28:46,960 --> 00:28:48,630
uh when people think about published
science they think of it as

1664
00:28:48,630 --> 00:28:48,640
science they think of it as
 

1665
00:28:48,640 --> 00:28:50,789
science they think of it as
automatically true and if it goes

1666
00:28:50,789 --> 00:28:50,799
automatically true and if it goes
 

1667
00:28:50,799 --> 00:28:51,990
automatically true and if it goes
through peer review it's automatically

1668
00:28:51,990 --> 00:28:52,000
through peer review it's automatically
 

1669
00:28:52,000 --> 00:28:52,950
through peer review it's automatically
true if it hasn't gone through peer

1670
00:28:52,950 --> 00:28:52,960
true if it hasn't gone through peer
 

1671
00:28:52,960 --> 00:28:55,029
true if it hasn't gone through peer
review it's not automatically true and

1672
00:28:55,029 --> 00:28:55,039
review it's not automatically true and
 

1673
00:28:55,039 --> 00:28:57,430
review it's not automatically true and
especially in medicine when we're not

1674
00:28:57,430 --> 00:28:57,440
especially in medicine when we're not
 

1675
00:28:57,440 --> 00:29:00,470
especially in medicine when we're not
used to having this at this access to

00:29:00,470 --> 00:29:00,480
used to having this at this access to
 

1677
00:29:00,480 --> 00:29:02,789
used to having this at this access to

work i mean in economics actually that's

1680
00:29:04,630 --> 00:29:04,640
work i mean in economics actually that's
 

1681
00:29:04,640 --> 00:29:07,190
work i mean in economics actually that's
quite normal you it takes years to get

1682
00:29:07,190 --> 00:29:07,200
quite normal you it takes years to get
 

1683
00:29:07,200 --> 00:29:08,950
quite normal you it takes years to get
something published so there's a very

1684
00:29:08,950 --> 00:29:08,960
something published so there's a very
 

1685
00:29:08,960 --> 00:29:11,909
something published so there's a very
active debate over or discussion about

1686
00:29:11,909 --> 00:29:11,919
active debate over or discussion about
 

1687
00:29:11,919 --> 00:29:13,510
active debate over or discussion about
papers before they're peer-reviewed in

1688
00:29:13,510 --> 00:29:13,520
papers before they're peer-reviewed in
 

1689
00:29:13,520 --> 00:29:15,830
papers before they're peer-reviewed in
this in this sort of working paper way

1690
00:29:15,830 --> 00:29:15,840
this in this sort of working paper way
 

1691
00:29:15,840 --> 00:29:18,549
this in this sort of working paper way
um much less normal or much much newer

1692
00:29:18,549 --> 00:29:18,559
um much less normal or much much newer
 

1693
00:29:18,559 --> 00:29:20,230
um much less normal or much much newer
in in medicine

1694
00:29:20,230 --> 00:29:20,240
in in medicine
 

1695
00:29:20,240 --> 00:29:21,590
in in medicine
and so i think part of that the

1696
00:29:21,590 --> 00:29:21,600
and so i think part of that the
 

1697
00:29:21,600 --> 00:29:23,990
and so i think part of that the
perception about what those that what

1698
00:29:23,990 --> 00:29:24,000
perception about what those that what
 

1699
00:29:24,000 --> 00:29:26,470
perception about what those that what
process happens in open science when you

1700
00:29:26,470 --> 00:29:26,480
process happens in open science when you
 

1701
00:29:26,480 --> 00:29:27,830
process happens in open science when you
release a study

1702
00:29:27,830 --> 00:29:27,840
release a study
 

1703
00:29:27,840 --> 00:29:29,510
release a study
that that got people confused and you're

1704
00:29:29,510 --> 00:29:29,520
that that got people confused and you're
 

1705
00:29:29,520 --> 00:29:31,350
that that got people confused and you're
right it was a very important result

1706
00:29:31,350 --> 00:29:31,360
right it was a very important result
 

1707
00:29:31,360 --> 00:29:33,190
right it was a very important result
because we had just locked the world

1708
00:29:33,190 --> 00:29:33,200
because we had just locked the world
 

1709
00:29:33,200 --> 00:29:35,990
because we had just locked the world
down in middle of march

1710
00:29:35,990 --> 00:29:36,000
down in middle of march
 

1711
00:29:36,000 --> 00:29:38,549
down in middle of march
with i think catastrophic results

1712
00:29:38,549 --> 00:29:38,559
with i think catastrophic results
 

1713
00:29:38,559 --> 00:29:40,470
with i think catastrophic results
and if the if that study was right if

1714
00:29:40,470 --> 00:29:40,480
and if the if that study was right if
 

1715
00:29:40,480 --> 00:29:42,470
and if the if that study was right if
our study was right that meant we'd made

1716
00:29:42,470 --> 00:29:42,480
our study was right that meant we'd made
 

1717
00:29:42,480 --> 00:29:43,830
our study was right that meant we'd made
a mistake

1718
00:29:43,830 --> 00:29:43,840
a mistake
 

1719
00:29:43,840 --> 00:29:45,669
a mistake
and not because the death rate was low

1720
00:29:45,669 --> 00:29:45,679
and not because the death rate was low
 

1721
00:29:45,679 --> 00:29:47,669
and not because the death rate was low
that's actually not the key thing there

1722
00:29:47,669 --> 00:29:47,679
that's actually not the key thing there
 

1723
00:29:47,679 --> 00:29:50,149
that's actually not the key thing there
the key thing is that we had adopted

1724
00:29:50,149 --> 00:29:50,159
the key thing is that we had adopted
 

1725
00:29:50,159 --> 00:29:52,549
the key thing is that we had adopted
these policies these test and trace

1726
00:29:52,549 --> 00:29:52,559
these policies these test and trace
 

1727
00:29:52,559 --> 00:29:54,789
these policies these test and trace
policies these policies these lockdown

1728
00:29:54,789 --> 00:29:54,799
policies these policies these lockdown
 

1729
00:29:54,799 --> 00:29:58,070
policies these policies these lockdown
policies aimed at suppressing the virus

1730
00:29:58,070 --> 00:29:58,080
policies aimed at suppressing the virus
 

1731
00:29:58,080 --> 00:30:00,230
policies aimed at suppressing the virus
level to close to zero that was

1732
00:30:00,230 --> 00:30:00,240
level to close to zero that was
 

1733
00:30:00,240 --> 00:30:01,750
level to close to zero that was
essentially the idea

1734
00:30:01,750 --> 00:30:01,760
essentially the idea
 

1735
00:30:01,760 --> 00:30:04,549
essentially the idea
if we can just get the virus to go away

1736
00:30:04,549 --> 00:30:04,559
if we can just get the virus to go away
 

1737
00:30:04,559 --> 00:30:05,750
if we can just get the virus to go away
we won't have to ever worry about it

1738
00:30:05,750 --> 00:30:05,760
we won't have to ever worry about it
 

1739
00:30:05,760 --> 00:30:07,269
we won't have to ever worry about it
again

1740
00:30:07,269 --> 00:30:07,279
again
 

1741
00:30:07,279 --> 00:30:09,510
again
the main problem with our result as far

1742
00:30:09,510 --> 00:30:09,520
the main problem with our result as far
 

1743
00:30:09,520 --> 00:30:10,870
the main problem with our result as far
as that strategy was concerned wasn't

1744
00:30:10,870 --> 00:30:10,880
as that strategy was concerned wasn't
 

1745
00:30:10,880 --> 00:30:13,190
as that strategy was concerned wasn't
the death rate it was the 40 to 50 times

1746
00:30:13,190 --> 00:30:13,200
the death rate it was the 40 to 50 times
 

1747
00:30:13,200 --> 00:30:15,029
the death rate it was the 40 to 50 times
more infections than cases it was the

1748
00:30:15,029 --> 00:30:15,039
more infections than cases it was the
 

1749
00:30:15,039 --> 00:30:17,029
more infections than cases it was the
two and a half percent or uh three

1750
00:30:17,029 --> 00:30:17,039
two and a half percent or uh three
 

1751
00:30:17,039 --> 00:30:19,350
two and a half percent or uh three
percent or four percent prevalence rate

1752
00:30:19,350 --> 00:30:19,360
percent or four percent prevalence rate
 

1753
00:30:19,360 --> 00:30:21,110
percent or four percent prevalence rate
that we identified

1754
00:30:21,110 --> 00:30:21,120
that we identified
 

1755
00:30:21,120 --> 00:30:23,029
that we identified
of the antibodies in the population if

1756
00:30:23,029 --> 00:30:23,039
of the antibodies in the population if
 

1757
00:30:23,039 --> 00:30:25,750
of the antibodies in the population if
that number is right it's too late the

1758
00:30:25,750 --> 00:30:25,760
that number is right it's too late the
 

1759
00:30:25,760 --> 00:30:27,909
that number is right it's too late the
virus is not going to go to zero

1760
00:30:27,909 --> 00:30:27,919
virus is not going to go to zero
 

1761
00:30:27,919 --> 00:30:29,669
virus is not going to go to zero
and no matter how much we test and trace

1762
00:30:29,669 --> 00:30:29,679
and no matter how much we test and trace
 

1763
00:30:29,679 --> 00:30:31,190
and no matter how much we test and trace
and isolate we're not going to get the

1764
00:30:31,190 --> 00:30:31,200
and isolate we're not going to get the
 

1765
00:30:31,200 --> 00:30:33,830
and isolate we're not going to get the
viral level down to zero

1766
00:30:33,830 --> 00:30:33,840
viral level down to zero
 

1767
00:30:33,840 --> 00:30:35,510
viral level down to zero
so we're going to have to

1768
00:30:35,510 --> 00:30:35,520
so we're going to have to
 

1769
00:30:35,520 --> 00:30:37,190
so we're going to have to
let the virus go through the entire

1770
00:30:37,190 --> 00:30:37,200
let the virus go through the entire
 

1771
00:30:37,200 --> 00:30:39,029
let the virus go through the entire
population in some way or something

1772
00:30:39,029 --> 00:30:39,039
population in some way or something
 

1773
00:30:39,039 --> 00:30:40,470
population in some way or something
normal well that we can talk about that

1774
00:30:40,470 --> 00:30:40,480
normal well that we can talk about that
 

1775
00:30:40,480 --> 00:30:41,830
normal well that we can talk about that
in a bit that's the great barrington

1776
00:30:41,830 --> 00:30:41,840
in a bit that's the great barrington
 

1777
00:30:41,840 --> 00:30:43,029
in a bit that's the great barrington
declaration you don't have to let the

1778
00:30:43,029 --> 00:30:43,039
declaration you don't have to let the
 

1779
00:30:43,039 --> 00:30:44,470
declaration you don't have to let the
virus go through the population you can

1780
00:30:44,470 --> 00:30:44,480
virus go through the population you can
 

1781
00:30:44,480 --> 00:30:46,950
virus go through the population you can
shield preferentially

1782
00:30:46,950 --> 00:30:46,960
shield preferentially
 

1783
00:30:46,960 --> 00:30:49,029
shield preferentially
the policy we chose was to shield

1784
00:30:49,029 --> 00:30:49,039
the policy we chose was to shield
 

1785
00:30:49,039 --> 00:30:51,990
the policy we chose was to shield
preferentially the the laptop class

1786
00:30:51,990 --> 00:30:52,000
preferentially the the laptop class
 

1787
00:30:52,000 --> 00:30:53,510
preferentially the the laptop class
the set of people who could work from

1788
00:30:53,510 --> 00:30:53,520
the set of people who could work from
 

1789
00:30:53,520 --> 00:30:54,389
the set of people who could work from
home

1790
00:30:54,389 --> 00:30:54,399
home
 

1791
00:30:54,399 --> 00:30:56,310
home
without losing their job

1792
00:30:56,310 --> 00:30:56,320
without losing their job
 

1793
00:30:56,320 --> 00:30:58,230
without losing their job
yeah and we did a very good job at

1794
00:30:58,230 --> 00:30:58,240
yeah and we did a very good job at
 

1795
00:30:58,240 --> 00:31:02,070
yeah and we did a very good job at
protecting them well let me um

1796
00:31:02,070 --> 00:31:02,080
protecting them well let me um
 

1797
00:31:02,080 --> 00:31:04,549
protecting them well let me um
take a small tangent we're gonna jump

1798
00:31:04,549 --> 00:31:04,559
take a small tangent we're gonna jump
 

1799
00:31:04,559 --> 00:31:06,470
take a small tangent we're gonna jump
around in time

1800
00:31:06,470 --> 00:31:06,480
around in time
 

1801
00:31:06,480 --> 00:31:07,990
around in time
which i think will be the best way to

1802
00:31:07,990 --> 00:31:08,000
which i think will be the best way to
 

1803
00:31:08,000 --> 00:31:10,470
which i think will be the best way to
tell the story so that was the beginning

1804
00:31:10,470 --> 00:31:10,480
tell the story so that was the beginning
 

1805
00:31:10,480 --> 00:31:12,789
tell the story so that was the beginning
yeah okay actually can i kind of go back

1806
00:31:12,789 --> 00:31:12,799
yeah okay actually can i kind of go back
 

1807
00:31:12,799 --> 00:31:14,070
yeah okay actually can i kind of go back
one more thing for that because that's

1808
00:31:14,070 --> 00:31:14,080
one more thing for that because that's
 

1809
00:31:14,080 --> 00:31:15,190
one more thing for that because that's
really important and i should have i

1810
00:31:15,190 --> 00:31:15,200
really important and i should have i
 

1811
00:31:15,200 --> 00:31:16,710
really important and i should have i
should have started with this

1812
00:31:16,710 --> 00:31:16,720
should have started with this
 

1813
00:31:16,720 --> 00:31:20,310
should have started with this
um what led me to do those studies

1814
00:31:20,310 --> 00:31:20,320
um what led me to do those studies
 

1815
00:31:20,320 --> 00:31:22,710
um what led me to do those studies
was a a paper that i had remembered

1816
00:31:22,710 --> 00:31:22,720
was a a paper that i had remembered
 

1817
00:31:22,720 --> 00:31:25,590
was a a paper that i had remembered
seeing from the h1n1 flu epidemic in

1818
00:31:25,590 --> 00:31:25,600
seeing from the h1n1 flu epidemic in
 

1819
00:31:25,600 --> 00:31:27,430
seeing from the h1n1 flu epidemic in
2009 this is this is where i've been

1820
00:31:27,430 --> 00:31:27,440
2009 this is this is where i've been
 

1821
00:31:27,440 --> 00:31:29,110
2009 this is this is where i've been
much less active in writing about that i

1822
00:31:29,110 --> 00:31:29,120
much less active in writing about that i
 

1823
00:31:29,120 --> 00:31:30,870
much less active in writing about that i
had written up like a paper or two about

1824
00:31:30,870 --> 00:31:30,880
had written up like a paper or two about
 

1825
00:31:30,880 --> 00:31:34,230
had written up like a paper or two about
that when in 2009

1826
00:31:34,230 --> 00:31:34,240
that when in 2009
 

1827
00:31:34,240 --> 00:31:36,389
that when in 2009
there there was actually this same

1828
00:31:36,389 --> 00:31:36,399
there there was actually this same
 

1829
00:31:36,399 --> 00:31:38,710
there there was actually this same
debate over the mortality rate

1830
00:31:38,710 --> 00:31:38,720
debate over the mortality rate
 

1831
00:31:38,720 --> 00:31:40,549
debate over the mortality rate
except it unfolded over the course of

1832
00:31:40,549 --> 00:31:40,559
except it unfolded over the course of

you know tested to have it um and the
 

1851
00:32:01,279 --> 00:32:03,909
you know tested to have it um and the
early estimates of the h1n1 mortality

early estimates of the h1n1 mortality
 

1853
00:32:03,919 --> 00:32:06,789
early estimates of the h1n1 mortality
were like four percent three percent

1854
00:32:06,789 --> 00:32:06,799
were like four percent three percent
 

1855
00:32:06,799 --> 00:32:08,789
were like four percent three percent
really really high

00:32:10,480 --> 00:32:12,470
over the course of a couple of more
years a whole bunch of zero prevalence

studies zero prevalence studies of h1n1

1862
00:32:14,310 --> 00:32:14,320
studies zero prevalence studies of h1n1
 

1863
00:32:14,320 --> 00:32:15,669
studies zero prevalence studies of h1n1
flu came out

1864
00:32:15,669 --> 00:32:15,679
flu came out
 

1865
00:32:15,679 --> 00:32:18,230
flu came out
and it turned out that there were

1866
00:32:18,230 --> 00:32:18,240
and it turned out that there were
 

1867
00:32:18,240 --> 00:32:20,870
and it turned out that there were
a hundred or more times of people

1868
00:32:20,870 --> 00:32:20,880
a hundred or more times of people
 

1869
00:32:20,880 --> 00:32:23,110
a hundred or more times of people
infected per case

1870
00:32:23,110 --> 00:32:23,120
infected per case
 

1871
00:32:23,120 --> 00:32:24,710
infected per case
and so the mortality rate was actually

1872
00:32:24,710 --> 00:32:24,720
and so the mortality rate was actually
 

1873
00:32:24,720 --> 00:32:27,350
and so the mortality rate was actually
something like 0.02

1874
00:32:27,350 --> 00:32:27,360
something like 0.02
 

1875
00:32:27,360 --> 00:32:30,310
something like 0.02
for h1n1 not the three three

1876
00:32:30,310 --> 00:32:30,320
for h1n1 not the three three
 

1877
00:32:30,320 --> 00:32:32,310
for h1n1 not the three three
like a hundredfold difference so this

1878
00:32:32,310 --> 00:32:32,320
like a hundredfold difference so this
 

1879
00:32:32,320 --> 00:32:33,669
like a hundredfold difference so this
made you think

1880
00:32:33,669 --> 00:32:33,679
made you think
 

1881
00:32:33,679 --> 00:32:35,750
made you think
okay it took us a couple of two to three

1882
00:32:35,750 --> 00:32:35,760
okay it took us a couple of two to three
 

1883
00:32:35,760 --> 00:32:37,750
okay it took us a couple of two to three
years to discover the truth behind the

1884
00:32:37,750 --> 00:32:37,760
years to discover the truth behind the
 

1885
00:32:37,760 --> 00:32:39,909
years to discover the truth behind the
actual infections

1886
00:32:39,909 --> 00:32:39,919
actual infections
 

1887
00:32:39,919 --> 00:32:42,789
actual infections
uh for a h1n1 and then

1888
00:32:42,789 --> 00:32:42,799
uh for a h1n1 and then
 

1889
00:32:42,799 --> 00:32:44,310
uh for a h1n1 and then
what's the truth here and can we get

1890
00:32:44,310 --> 00:32:44,320
what's the truth here and can we get
 

1891
00:32:44,320 --> 00:32:46,310
what's the truth here and can we get
there faster yeah and and there was it

1892
00:32:46,310 --> 00:32:46,320
there faster yeah and and there was it
 

1893
00:32:46,320 --> 00:32:48,070
there faster yeah and and there was it
spreads in a similar way as the as the

1894
00:32:48,070 --> 00:32:48,080
spreads in a similar way as the as the
 

1895
00:32:48,080 --> 00:32:49,830
spreads in a similar way as the as the
h1n1 fluid did i mean it's it's spreads

1896
00:32:49,830 --> 00:32:49,840
h1n1 fluid did i mean it's it's spreads
 

1897
00:32:49,840 --> 00:32:52,389
h1n1 fluid did i mean it's it's spreads
very solidization via you know so

by foam eyes but it seems like that's
 

1905
00:32:57,919 --> 00:33:00,549

less likely now in any case it seemed

00:33:00,549 --> 00:33:00,559
less likely now in any case it seemed
 

1907
00:33:00,559 --> 00:33:02,950
less likely now in any case it seemed
really important to me to speed up the

really important to me to speed up the
 

1909
00:33:02,960 --> 00:33:04,710
really important to me to speed up the

how deadly is coved so you mentioned
 

1929
00:33:25,039 --> 00:33:26,870
how deadly is coved so you mentioned
covet is a very particular kind of

steepness
where the x-axis is age

1934
00:33:32,070 --> 00:33:32,080
where the x-axis is age
 

1935
00:33:32,080 --> 00:33:33,430
where the x-axis is age
so

1936
00:33:33,430 --> 00:33:33,440
so
 

1937
00:33:33,440 --> 00:33:35,350
so
in that context could you maybe compare

1938
00:33:35,350 --> 00:33:35,360
in that context could you maybe compare
 

1939
00:33:35,360 --> 00:33:37,750
in that context could you maybe compare
influenza and kovid because a lot of

1940
00:33:37,750 --> 00:33:37,760
influenza and kovid because a lot of
 

1941
00:33:37,760 --> 00:33:40,389
influenza and kovid because a lot of
people

1942
00:33:40,389 --> 00:33:40,399

 

1943
00:33:40,399 --> 00:33:42,950

1946
00:33:45,269 --> 00:33:45,279
the lizards who run the world have
 

1947
00:33:45,279 --> 00:33:48,310
the lizards who run the world have
completely fabricated invented kovid

1948
00:33:48,310 --> 00:33:48,320
completely fabricated invented kovid
 

1949
00:33:48,320 --> 00:33:50,310
completely fabricated invented kovid
outside of those folks kind of the

1950
00:33:50,310 --> 00:33:50,320
outside of those folks kind of the
 

1951
00:33:50,320 --> 00:33:51,350
outside of those folks kind of the

00:33:53,190 --> 00:33:53,200
process by which you dismiss the threat
 

1955
00:33:53,200 --> 00:33:55,430
process by which you dismiss the threat
of covait to say well it's just like the

1956
00:33:55,430 --> 00:33:55,440
of covait to say well it's just like the
 

1957
00:33:55,440 --> 00:33:57,110

flu the flu is a very serious thing

1958
00:33:57,110 --> 00:33:57,120
flu the flu is a very serious thing
 

1959
00:33:57,120 --> 00:33:59,430
flu the flu is a very serious thing
actually um so

1960
00:33:59,430 --> 00:33:59,440
actually um so
 

1961
00:33:59,440 --> 00:34:01,669
actually um so
in that comparison

1962
00:34:01,669 --> 00:34:01,679
in that comparison
 

1963
00:34:01,679 --> 00:34:03,590
in that comparison
where does kovitz stand

1964
00:34:03,590 --> 00:34:03,600
where does kovitz stand
 

1965
00:34:03,600 --> 00:34:04,950
where does kovitz stand
yeah the flu is a very serious thing it

1966
00:34:04,950 --> 00:34:04,960
yeah the flu is a very serious thing it
 

1967
00:34:04,960 --> 00:34:07,750
yeah the flu is a very serious thing it
kills you know 50 60 000 people a year

1968
00:34:07,750 --> 00:34:07,760
kills you know 50 60 000 people a year
 

1969
00:34:07,760 --> 00:34:09,030
kills you know 50 60 000 people a year
something i found that order depending

1970
00:34:09,030 --> 00:34:09,040
something i found that order depending
 

1971
00:34:09,040 --> 00:34:10,710
something i found that order depending
on the the particular strain that goes

1972
00:34:10,710 --> 00:34:10,720
on the the particular strain that goes
 

1973
00:34:10,720 --> 00:34:12,629
on the the particular strain that goes
around uh that's in the united states

1974
00:34:12,629 --> 00:34:12,639
around uh that's in the united states
 

1975
00:34:12,639 --> 00:34:14,869
around uh that's in the united states
the primary difference to me are the

1976
00:34:14,869 --> 00:34:14,879
the primary difference to me are the
 

1977
00:34:14,879 --> 00:34:16,069
the primary difference to me are the
there's lots of differences but one of

1978
00:34:16,069 --> 00:34:16,079
there's lots of differences but one of
 

1979
00:34:16,079 --> 00:34:18,149
there's lots of differences but one of
the most salient differences is the age

1980
00:34:18,149 --> 00:34:18,159
the most salient differences is the age
 

1981
00:34:18,159 --> 00:34:21,349
the most salient differences is the age
gradient and mortality risk for the flu

1982
00:34:21,349 --> 00:34:21,359
gradient and mortality risk for the flu
 

1983
00:34:21,359 --> 00:34:24,069
gradient and mortality risk for the flu
so the flu is more deadly for two

1984
00:34:24,069 --> 00:34:24,079
so the flu is more deadly for two
 

1985
00:34:24,079 --> 00:34:26,550
so the flu is more deadly for two
children than covet is

1986
00:34:26,550 --> 00:34:26,560
children than covet is
 

1987
00:34:26,560 --> 00:34:29,349
children than covet is
there's no controversy about that

1988
00:34:29,349 --> 00:34:29,359
there's no controversy about that
 

1989
00:34:29,359 --> 00:34:31,669
there's no controversy about that
children thank god

1990
00:34:31,669 --> 00:34:31,679
children thank god
 

1991
00:34:31,679 --> 00:34:33,510
children thank god
have much less

1992
00:34:33,510 --> 00:34:33,520
have much less
 

1993
00:34:33,520 --> 00:34:34,950
have much less

1994
00:34:34,950 --> 00:34:34,960
uh severe
 

1995
00:34:34,960 --> 00:34:37,990
uh severe
reactions to covet infection to than

1996
00:34:37,990 --> 00:34:38,000
reactions to covet infection to than
 

1997
00:34:38,000 --> 00:34:40,950
reactions to covet infection to than
that due to flu infections and rate of

1998
00:34:40,950 --> 00:34:40,960
that due to flu infections and rate of
 

1999
00:34:40,960 --> 00:34:42,950
that due to flu infections and rate of
fatalities fatality all of that i think

2000
00:34:42,950 --> 00:34:42,960
fatalities fatality all of that i think
 

2001
00:34:42,960 --> 00:34:44,629
fatalities fatality all of that i think
you mentioned um

2002
00:34:44,629 --> 00:34:44,639
you mentioned um
 

2003
00:34:44,639 --> 00:34:45,990
you mentioned um
i mean it's interesting to maybe also

2004
00:34:45,990 --> 00:34:46,000
i mean it's interesting to maybe also
 

2005
00:34:46,000 --> 00:34:47,829
i mean it's interesting to maybe also
comment on i think in another

2006
00:34:47,829 --> 00:34:47,839
comment on i think in another
 

2007
00:34:47,839 --> 00:34:49,909
comment on i think in another
conversation mentioned there's a u

2008
00:34:49,909 --> 00:34:49,919
conversation mentioned there's a u
 

2009
00:34:49,919 --> 00:34:51,030
conversation mentioned there's a u
shape

2010
00:34:51,030 --> 00:34:51,040
shape
 

2011
00:34:51,040 --> 00:34:52,869
shape
to the

2012
00:34:52,869 --> 00:34:52,879
to the
 

2013
00:34:52,879 --> 00:34:54,310
to the
to the flu curve

2014
00:34:54,310 --> 00:34:54,320
to the flu curve
 

2015
00:34:54,320 --> 00:34:56,310
to the flu curve
so meaning like there's actually quite a

2016
00:34:56,310 --> 00:34:56,320
so meaning like there's actually quite a
 

2017
00:34:56,320 --> 00:34:59,109
so meaning like there's actually quite a
large number of kids that die from flu

2018
00:34:59,109 --> 00:34:59,119
large number of kids that die from flu
 

2019
00:34:59,119 --> 00:35:02,310
large number of kids that die from flu
yeah i mean the 1918 flu the h1n1 flew

2020
00:35:02,310 --> 00:35:02,320
yeah i mean the 1918 flu the h1n1 flew
 

2021
00:35:02,320 --> 00:35:04,950
yeah i mean the 1918 flu the h1n1 flew
that the spanish flu in the us killed

2022
00:35:04,950 --> 00:35:04,960
that the spanish flu in the us killed
 

2023
00:35:04,960 --> 00:35:09,349
that the spanish flu in the us killed
millions of of of uh of younger people

2024
00:35:09,349 --> 00:35:09,359
millions of of of uh of younger people
 

2025
00:35:09,359 --> 00:35:13,430
millions of of of uh of younger people
and um that is not the case with covid

2026
00:35:13,430 --> 00:35:13,440
and um that is not the case with covid
 

2027
00:35:13,440 --> 00:35:15,030
and um that is not the case with covid
more than um

2028
00:35:15,030 --> 00:35:15,040
more than um
 

2029
00:35:15,040 --> 00:35:16,790
more than um
i'm going to get the number wrong but

2030
00:35:16,790 --> 00:35:16,800
i'm going to get the number wrong but
 

2031
00:35:16,800 --> 00:35:18,790
i'm going to get the number wrong but
something like 70 80 percent of the

2032
00:35:18,790 --> 00:35:18,800
something like 70 80 percent of the
 

2033
00:35:18,800 --> 00:35:21,589
something like 70 80 percent of the
deaths are people over the age of 60.

2034
00:35:21,589 --> 00:35:21,599
deaths are people over the age of 60.
 

2035
00:35:21,599 --> 00:35:23,030
deaths are people over the age of 60.
well we've talked about the fear the

2036
00:35:23,030 --> 00:35:23,040
well we've talked about the fear the
 

2037
00:35:23,040 --> 00:35:24,870
well we've talked about the fear the
whole time really

2038
00:35:24,870 --> 00:35:24,880
whole time really
 

2039
00:35:24,880 --> 00:35:27,750
whole time really
but my interaction with folks

2040
00:35:27,750 --> 00:35:27,760
but my interaction with folks
 

2041
00:35:27,760 --> 00:35:29,190
but my interaction with folks
now i want to have a family i want to

2045
00:35:31,839 --> 00:35:33,349
have kids but i don't have that real
firsthand experience but my interaction

2046
00:35:33,349 --> 00:35:33,359
firsthand experience but my interaction
 

2047
00:35:33,359 --> 00:35:35,670
firsthand experience but my interaction
with folks is at the core of fear

2048
00:35:35,670 --> 00:35:35,680
with folks is at the core of fear
 

2049
00:35:35,680 --> 00:35:37,829
with folks is at the core of fear
that folks had

2050
00:35:37,829 --> 00:35:37,839
that folks had
 

2051
00:35:37,839 --> 00:35:39,829
that folks had
is for their children

2052
00:35:39,829 --> 00:35:39,839
is for their children
 

2053
00:35:39,839 --> 00:35:41,510
is for their children
like

2054
00:35:41,510 --> 00:35:41,520
like
 

2055
00:35:41,520 --> 00:35:42,870
like
that

2056
00:35:42,870 --> 00:35:42,880
that
 

2057
00:35:42,880 --> 00:35:45,030
that
somehow you know i don't want to get

2058
00:35:45,030 --> 00:35:45,040
somehow you know i don't want to get
 

2059
00:35:45,040 --> 00:35:47,750
somehow you know i don't want to get
infected because of the kids like

2060
00:35:47,750 --> 00:35:47,760
infected because of the kids like
 

2061
00:35:47,760 --> 00:35:49,750
infected because of the kids like
because god forbid something happens to

2062
00:35:49,750 --> 00:35:49,760
because god forbid something happens to
 

2063
00:35:49,760 --> 00:35:51,750
because god forbid something happens to
the kids and i think

2064
00:35:51,750 --> 00:35:51,760
the kids and i think
 

2065
00:35:51,760 --> 00:35:54,390
the kids and i think
that obviously that makes a lot of sense

2066
00:35:54,390 --> 00:35:54,400
that obviously that makes a lot of sense
 

2067
00:35:54,400 --> 00:35:55,430
that obviously that makes a lot of sense
this kind of

2068
00:35:55,430 --> 00:35:55,440
this kind of
 

2069
00:35:55,440 --> 00:35:57,270
this kind of
the kids come first no matter what

2070
00:35:57,270 --> 00:35:57,280
the kids come first no matter what
 

2071
00:35:57,280 --> 00:35:59,750
the kids come first no matter what
that's number one priority but in for

2072
00:35:59,750 --> 00:35:59,760
that's number one priority but in for
 

2073
00:35:59,760 --> 00:36:01,990
that's number one priority but in for
this particular virus

2074
00:36:01,990 --> 00:36:02,000
this particular virus
 

2075
00:36:02,000 --> 00:36:04,150
this particular virus
that reasoning was um

2076
00:36:04,150 --> 00:36:04,160
that reasoning was um
 

2077
00:36:04,160 --> 00:36:05,910
that reasoning was um
not grounded in data it seems like or

2078
00:36:05,910 --> 00:36:05,920
not grounded in data it seems like or
 

2079
00:36:05,920 --> 00:36:08,069
not grounded in data it seems like or
that emotion and feeling yeah it was not

2080
00:36:08,069 --> 00:36:08,079
that emotion and feeling yeah it was not
 

2081
00:36:08,079 --> 00:36:10,550
that emotion and feeling yeah it was not
grounded it wasn't at the same time this

2082
00:36:10,550 --> 00:36:10,560
grounded it wasn't at the same time this
 

2083
00:36:10,560 --> 00:36:12,390
grounded it wasn't at the same time this
is way more deadly than the flu just

2084
00:36:12,390 --> 00:36:12,400
is way more deadly than the flu just
 

2085
00:36:12,400 --> 00:36:15,349
is way more deadly than the flu just
overall and especially to older people

2086
00:36:15,349 --> 00:36:15,359
overall and especially to older people
 

2087
00:36:15,359 --> 00:36:16,390
overall and especially to older people
yes

2088
00:36:16,390 --> 00:36:16,400
yes
 

2089
00:36:16,400 --> 00:36:18,710
yes
right so the numbers when when the story

2090
00:36:18,710 --> 00:36:18,720
right so the numbers when when the story
 

2091
00:36:18,720 --> 00:36:19,430
right so the numbers when when the story
is

2092
00:36:19,430 --> 00:36:19,440
is
 

2093
00:36:19,440 --> 00:36:20,950
is
all said and done

2094
00:36:20,950 --> 00:36:20,960
all said and done
 

2095
00:36:20,960 --> 00:36:22,870
all said and done
the covet would take

2096
00:36:22,870 --> 00:36:22,880
the covet would take
 

2097
00:36:22,880 --> 00:36:24,950
the covet would take
many more lives yeah

2098
00:36:24,950 --> 00:36:24,960
many more lives yeah
 

2099
00:36:24,960 --> 00:36:26,950
many more lives yeah
so i mean 0.2 is sounds like a small

2100
00:36:26,950 --> 00:36:26,960
so i mean 0.2 is sounds like a small
 

2101
00:36:26,960 --> 00:36:28,470
so i mean 0.2 is sounds like a small
number but it's not a small number

2102
00:36:28,470 --> 00:36:28,480
number but it's not a small number
 

2103
00:36:28,480 --> 00:36:30,390
number but it's not a small number
worldwide what do you think that number

2104
00:36:30,390 --> 00:36:30,400
worldwide what do you think that number
 

2105
00:36:30,400 --> 00:36:31,349
worldwide what do you think that number
will be

2106
00:36:31,349 --> 00:36:31,359
will be
 

2107
00:36:31,359 --> 00:36:33,270
will be
by the you know that's not that's not

2108
00:36:33,270 --> 00:36:33,280
by the you know that's not that's not
 

2109
00:36:33,280 --> 00:36:36,150
by the you know that's not that's not
like but would we cross i think it's in

2110
00:36:36,150 --> 00:36:36,160
like but would we cross i think it's in
 

2111
00:36:36,160 --> 00:36:39,109
like but would we cross i think it's in
the united states it's uh

2112
00:36:39,109 --> 00:36:39,119
the united states it's uh
 

2113
00:36:39,119 --> 00:36:40,790
the united states it's uh
the way the desk currently reports like

2114
00:36:40,790 --> 00:36:40,800
the way the desk currently reports like
 

2115
00:36:40,800 --> 00:36:42,950
the way the desk currently reports like
800 000 something like that do you think

2116
00:36:42,950 --> 00:36:42,960
800 000 something like that do you think
 

2117
00:36:42,960 --> 00:36:46,150
800 000 something like that do you think
we'll cross a million seems likely

2118
00:36:46,150 --> 00:36:46,160
we'll cross a million seems likely
 

2119
00:36:46,160 --> 00:36:48,230
we'll cross a million seems likely
yeah do you think it's something that

2120
00:36:48,230 --> 00:36:48,240
yeah do you think it's something that
 

2121
00:36:48,240 --> 00:36:50,230
yeah do you think it's something that
might continue with different variants

2122
00:36:50,230 --> 00:36:50,240
might continue with different variants
 

2123
00:36:50,240 --> 00:36:52,230
might continue with different variants
what well i i think um so we can talk

2124
00:36:52,230 --> 00:36:52,240
what well i i think um so we can talk
 

2125
00:36:52,240 --> 00:36:53,510
what well i i think um so we can talk
about the end state of cover the end

2126
00:36:53,510 --> 00:36:53,520
about the end state of cover the end
 

2127
00:36:53,520 --> 00:36:56,150
about the end state of cover the end
state of covet is it's here forever

2128
00:36:56,150 --> 00:36:56,160
state of covet is it's here forever
 

2129
00:36:56,160 --> 00:37:00,230
state of covet is it's here forever
i think that there is good evidence of

2130
00:37:00,230 --> 00:37:00,240
i think that there is good evidence of
 

2131
00:37:00,240 --> 00:37:04,310
i think that there is good evidence of
immunity after infection

2132
00:37:04,310 --> 00:37:04,320
immunity after infection
 

2133
00:37:04,320 --> 00:37:06,230
immunity after infection
such that you're protected both against

2134
00:37:06,230 --> 00:37:06,240
such that you're protected both against
 

2135
00:37:06,240 --> 00:37:08,790
such that you're protected both against
reinfection and also against severe

2136
00:37:08,790 --> 00:37:08,800
reinfection and also against severe
 

2137
00:37:08,800 --> 00:37:11,190
reinfection and also against severe
disease upon reinfection

2138
00:37:11,190 --> 00:37:11,200
disease upon reinfection
 

2139
00:37:11,200 --> 00:37:12,950
disease upon reinfection
so the second time you get it it's not

2140
00:37:12,950 --> 00:37:12,960
so the second time you get it it's not
 

2141
00:37:12,960 --> 00:37:14,550
so the second time you get it it's not
true for everyone but for many people

2142
00:37:14,550 --> 00:37:14,560
true for everyone but for many people
 

2143
00:37:14,560 --> 00:37:15,829
true for everyone but for many people
the second time you get it will be

2144
00:37:15,829 --> 00:37:15,839
the second time you get it will be
 

2145
00:37:15,839 --> 00:37:17,910
the second time you get it will be
milder much milder than the first time

2146
00:37:17,910 --> 00:37:17,920
milder much milder than the first time
 

2147
00:37:17,920 --> 00:37:21,190
milder much milder than the first time
you get it with the long tail like uh

2148
00:37:21,190 --> 00:37:21,200
you get it with the long tail like uh
 

2149
00:37:21,200 --> 00:37:23,510
you get it with the long tail like uh
that lasts for a long time yeah so just

2150
00:37:23,510 --> 00:37:23,520
that lasts for a long time yeah so just
 

2151
00:37:23,520 --> 00:37:25,589
that lasts for a long time yeah so just
there's studies that uh that follow of

2152
00:37:25,589 --> 00:37:25,599
there's studies that uh that follow of
 

2153
00:37:25,599 --> 00:37:27,190
there's studies that uh that follow of
course people who are infected for a

2154
00:37:27,190 --> 00:37:27,200
course people who are infected for a
 

2155
00:37:27,200 --> 00:37:28,150
course people who are infected for a
year

2156
00:37:28,150 --> 00:37:28,160
year
 

2157
00:37:28,160 --> 00:37:29,670
year
and the reinfection rate is something

2158
00:37:29,670 --> 00:37:29,680
and the reinfection rate is something
 

2159
00:37:29,680 --> 00:37:31,589
and the reinfection rate is something
like somewhere between point three and

2160
00:37:31,589 --> 00:37:31,599
like somewhere between point three and
 

2161
00:37:31,599 --> 00:37:35,030
like somewhere between point three and
one percent yeah um and like a pretty

2162
00:37:35,030 --> 00:37:35,040
one percent yeah um and like a pretty
 

2163
00:37:35,040 --> 00:37:36,710
one percent yeah um and like a pretty
fantastic study italy's found that

2164
00:37:36,710 --> 00:37:36,720
fantastic study italy's found that
 

2165
00:37:36,720 --> 00:37:38,630
fantastic study italy's found that
there's there was one in sweden i think

2166
00:37:38,630 --> 00:37:38,640
there's there was one in sweden i think
 

2167
00:37:38,640 --> 00:37:39,990
there's there was one in sweden i think
there's a few studies that found there's

2168
00:37:39,990 --> 00:37:40,000
there's a few studies that found there's
 

2169
00:37:40,000 --> 00:37:43,030
there's a few studies that found there's
some similar things um and the

2170
00:37:43,030 --> 00:37:43,040
some similar things um and the
 

2171
00:37:43,040 --> 00:37:44,870
some similar things um and the
reinfections

2172
00:37:44,870 --> 00:37:44,880
reinfections
 

2173
00:37:44,880 --> 00:37:47,030
reinfections
tend to produce much mild disease much

2174
00:37:47,030 --> 00:37:47,040
tend to produce much mild disease much
 

2175
00:37:47,040 --> 00:37:48,470
tend to produce much mild disease much
less likely end up in the hospital much

2176
00:37:48,470 --> 00:37:48,480
less likely end up in the hospital much
 

2177
00:37:48,480 --> 00:37:51,510
less likely end up in the hospital much
less likely to die um so what the end

2178
00:37:51,510 --> 00:37:51,520
less likely to die um so what the end
 

2179
00:37:51,520 --> 00:37:53,589
less likely to die um so what the end
state of covid is it's circulating the

2180
00:37:53,589 --> 00:37:53,599
state of covid is it's circulating the
 

2181
00:37:53,599 --> 00:37:54,950
state of covid is it's circulating the
population forever and you get it

2182
00:37:54,950 --> 00:37:54,960
population forever and you get it
 

2183
00:37:54,960 --> 00:37:56,390
population forever and you get it
multiple times

2184
00:37:56,390 --> 00:37:56,400
multiple times
 

2185
00:37:56,400 --> 00:37:57,589
multiple times
yeah

2186
00:37:57,589 --> 00:37:57,599
yeah
 

2187
00:37:57,599 --> 00:37:59,030
yeah
and and then there's

2188
00:37:59,030 --> 00:37:59,040
and and then there's
 

2189
00:37:59,040 --> 00:38:01,750
and and then there's
i think studies and discussions like the

2190
00:38:01,750 --> 00:38:01,760
i think studies and discussions like the
 

2191
00:38:01,760 --> 00:38:04,150
i think studies and discussions like the
the best protection would be to get it

2192
00:38:04,150 --> 00:38:04,160
the best protection would be to get it
 

2193
00:38:04,160 --> 00:38:06,470
the best protection would be to get it
and then also to get vaccinated and then

2194
00:38:06,470 --> 00:38:06,480
and then also to get vaccinated and then
 

2195
00:38:06,480 --> 00:38:08,630
and then also to get vaccinated and then
a lot of people push back against that

2196
00:38:08,630 --> 00:38:08,640
a lot of people push back against that
 

2197
00:38:08,640 --> 00:38:10,630
a lot of people push back against that
for the obvious reasons from both sides

2198
00:38:10,630 --> 00:38:10,640
for the obvious reasons from both sides
 

2199
00:38:10,640 --> 00:38:12,630
for the obvious reasons from both sides
because somehow this the discourse has

2200
00:38:12,630 --> 00:38:12,640
because somehow this the discourse has
 

2201
00:38:12,640 --> 00:38:13,910
because somehow this the discourse has
become less scientific and more

2202
00:38:13,910 --> 00:38:13,920
become less scientific and more
 

2203
00:38:13,920 --> 00:38:16,470
become less scientific and more
political well i think you wanna like

2204
00:38:16,470 --> 00:38:16,480
political well i think you wanna like
 

2205
00:38:16,480 --> 00:38:18,470
political well i think you wanna like
the first time you meet it is going to

2206
00:38:18,470 --> 00:38:18,480
the first time you meet it is going to
 

2207
00:38:18,480 --> 00:38:20,150
the first time you meet it is going to
be the most deadly for you

2208
00:38:20,150 --> 00:38:20,160
be the most deadly for you
 

2209
00:38:20,160 --> 00:38:21,670
be the most deadly for you
and so the first time you meet it is

2210
00:38:21,670 --> 00:38:21,680
and so the first time you meet it is
 

2211
00:38:21,680 --> 00:38:23,190
and so the first time you meet it is
wise to be vaccinated the vaccine

2212
00:38:23,190 --> 00:38:23,200
wise to be vaccinated the vaccine
 

2213
00:38:23,200 --> 00:38:25,270
wise to be vaccinated the vaccine
reduces severe disease

2214
00:38:25,270 --> 00:38:25,280
reduces severe disease
 

2215
00:38:25,280 --> 00:38:27,510
reduces severe disease
yeah well we'll talk about the vaccine

2216
00:38:27,510 --> 00:38:27,520
yeah well we'll talk about the vaccine
 

2217
00:38:27,520 --> 00:38:29,030
yeah well we'll talk about the vaccine
because i want to make sure i address it

2218
00:38:29,030 --> 00:38:29,040
because i want to make sure i address it
 

2219
00:38:29,040 --> 00:38:30,069
because i want to make sure i address it
carefully

2220
00:38:30,069 --> 00:38:30,079
carefully
 

2221
00:38:30,079 --> 00:38:33,589
carefully
and properly in full context

2222
00:38:33,589 --> 00:38:33,599
and properly in full context

um
 

2225
00:38:34,880 --> 00:38:37,910
um
but yes sort of uh to add to the context

2226
00:38:37,910 --> 00:38:37,920
but yes sort of uh to add to the context
 

2227
00:38:37,920 --> 00:38:39,670
but yes sort of uh to add to the context
a lot of the fascinating discussions

2228
00:38:39,670 --> 00:38:39,680
a lot of the fascinating discussions
 

2229
00:38:39,680 --> 00:38:42,150
a lot of the fascinating discussions
we're having is um in the early days of

2230
00:38:42,150 --> 00:38:42,160
we're having is um in the early days of
 

2231
00:38:42,160 --> 00:38:45,030
we're having is um in the early days of
covid and now for people who are

2232
00:38:45,030 --> 00:38:45,040
covid and now for people who are
 

2233
00:38:45,040 --> 00:38:46,790
covid and now for people who are
unvaccinated that's where the

2234
00:38:46,790 --> 00:38:46,800
unvaccinated that's where the
 

2235
00:38:46,800 --> 00:38:48,950
unvaccinated that's where the
interesting story is

2236
00:38:48,950 --> 00:38:48,960
interesting story is
 

2237
00:38:48,960 --> 00:38:51,030
interesting story is
the policy story the sociology

2238
00:38:51,030 --> 00:38:51,040
the policy story the sociology
 

2239
00:38:51,040 --> 00:38:53,829
the policy story the sociology
sociological story and so on but

2240
00:38:53,829 --> 00:38:53,839
sociological story and so on but
 

2241
00:38:53,839 --> 00:38:55,030
sociological story and so on but
let me go to something really

2242
00:38:55,030 --> 00:38:55,040
let me go to something really
 

2243
00:38:55,040 --> 00:38:57,030
let me go to something really
fascinating just because of the people

2244
00:38:57,030 --> 00:38:57,040
fascinating just because of the people
 

2245
00:38:57,040 --> 00:38:59,430
fascinating just because of the people
involved the human beings evolved and

followers and stuff like that like did
 

3087

followers and stuff like that like did
you just do that and then they said

3088
00:54:18,950 --> 00:54:18,960
you just do that and then they said
 

3089
00:54:18,960 --> 00:54:21,030
you just do that and then they said
enough of that nonsense

3090
00:54:21,030 --> 00:54:21,040
enough of that nonsense
 

3091
00:54:21,040 --> 00:54:25,270
enough of that nonsense

so just yeah exactly but this broke my

heart the arrogance and this is echoes
 

3107
00:54:42,240 --> 00:54:43,670
heart the arrogance and this is echoes
of that arrogance is something you see

3108
00:54:43,670 --> 00:54:43,680
of that arrogance is something you see
 

3109
00:54:43,680 --> 00:54:46,150
of that arrogance is something you see
in this email and i really would love to

3110
00:54:46,150 --> 00:54:46,160
in this email and i really would love to
 

3111

try to figure out how can we find a path

3114
00:54:49,750 --> 00:54:49,760
try to figure out how can we find a path
 

3115
00:54:49,760 --> 00:54:51,670
try to figure out how can we find a path
forward i think a lot of

3116
00:54:51,670 --> 00:54:51,680
forward i think a lot of
 

3117
00:54:51,680 --> 00:54:53,510
forward i think a lot of
a lot of the problems

3118
00:54:53,510 --> 00:54:53,520
a lot of the problems
 

3119
00:54:53,520 --> 00:54:55,589
a lot of the problems
we've seen in the

the scientific community
 

3125
00:54:58,960 --> 00:55:00,390
the scientific community
you know there's there's two ways to

3126
00:55:00,390 --> 00:55:00,400
you know there's there's two ways to
 

3127
00:55:00,400 --> 00:55:02,630
you know there's there's two ways to
look at science i think uh that that

3128
00:55:02,630 --> 00:55:02,640
look at science i think uh that that
 

3129
00:55:02,640 --> 00:55:04,230
look at science i think uh that that
have been competing with each other for

3130
00:55:04,230 --> 00:55:04,240
have been competing with each other for
 

3131
00:55:04,240 --> 00:55:06,230
have been competing with each other for
a while now

3132
00:55:06,230 --> 00:55:06,240
a while now
 

3133
00:55:06,240 --> 00:55:08,309
a while now
one way and this is the way that i view

3134
00:55:08,309 --> 00:55:08,319
one way and this is the way that i view
 

3135
00:55:08,319 --> 00:55:09,829
one way and this is the way that i view
science and why i've always found it so

3136
00:55:09,829 --> 00:55:09,839
science and why i've always found it so
 

3137
00:55:09,839 --> 00:55:10,870
science and why i've always found it so
attractive

3138
00:55:10,870 --> 00:55:10,880
attractive
 

3139

3142
00:55:14,150 --> 00:55:14,160
discussion
 

3143
00:55:14,160 --> 00:55:15,349
discussion
where

3144
00:55:15,349 --> 00:55:15,359
where
 

3145
00:55:15,359 --> 00:55:17,510
where
the the discussion is tempered by by

00:55:17,510 --> 00:55:17,520
the the discussion is tempered by by
 

3147
00:55:17,520 --> 00:55:20,630
the the discussion is tempered by by
evidence by data by by reasoning and

00:55:20,630 --> 00:55:20,640
evidence by data by by reasoning and
 

3149
00:55:20,640 --> 00:55:21,670
evidence by data by by reasoning and

3150
00:55:21,670 --> 00:55:21,680
logic
 

3151
00:55:21,680 --> 00:55:23,829
logic
right so it's a dialectical process

3152
00:55:23,829 --> 00:55:23,839
right so it's a dialectical process
 

3153
00:55:23,839 --> 00:55:26,870
right so it's a dialectical process
where if i believe a and you believe b

3154
00:55:26,870 --> 00:55:26,880
where if i believe a and you believe b
 

3155
00:55:26,880 --> 00:55:29,990
where if i believe a and you believe b
well uh we talk about it we come up with

3156
00:55:29,990 --> 00:55:30,000
well uh we talk about it we come up with
 

3157
00:55:30,000 --> 00:55:31,670
well uh we talk about it we come up with
an experiment that distinguishes between

3158
00:55:31,670 --> 00:55:31,680
an experiment that distinguishes between
 

3159
00:55:31,680 --> 00:55:34,150
an experiment that distinguishes between
the two and while you know b turns out

3160
00:55:34,150 --> 00:55:34,160
the two and while you know b turns out
 

3161
00:55:34,160 --> 00:55:36,150
the two and while you know b turns out
to be right i'm i'm all frustrated but i

3162
00:55:36,150 --> 00:55:36,160
to be right i'm i'm all frustrated but i
 

3163
00:55:36,160 --> 00:55:38,470
to be right i'm i'm all frustrated but i
buy you dinner and i say no no no c and

3164
00:55:38,470 --> 00:55:38,480
buy you dinner and i say no no no c and
 

3165
00:55:38,480 --> 00:55:40,789
buy you dinner and i say no no no c and
then we go on from there right that's

3166
00:55:40,789 --> 00:55:40,799
then we go on from there right that's
 

3167
00:55:40,799 --> 00:55:43,430
then we go on from there right that's
that's what science is at its best it's

3168
00:55:43,430 --> 00:55:43,440
that's what science is at its best it's
 

3169
00:55:43,440 --> 00:55:46,309
that's what science is at its best it's
this process of using data in discussion

3170
00:55:46,309 --> 00:55:46,319
this process of using data in discussion
 

3171
00:55:46,319 --> 00:55:49,430
this process of using data in discussion
it's a human activity right uh to to to

3172
00:55:49,430 --> 00:55:49,440
it's a human activity right uh to to to
 

3173
00:55:49,440 --> 00:55:50,549
it's a human activity right uh to to to
learn

3174
00:55:50,549 --> 00:55:50,559
learn
 

3175
00:55:50,559 --> 00:55:52,710
learn
to let have the truth unfold itself

3176
00:55:52,710 --> 00:55:52,720
to let have the truth unfold itself
 

3177
00:55:52,720 --> 00:55:54,069
to let have the truth unfold itself
before us

3178
00:55:54,069 --> 00:55:54,079
before us
 

3179
00:55:54,079 --> 00:55:56,470
before us
on the other hand there are

3180
00:55:56,470 --> 00:55:56,480
on the other hand there are
 

3181
00:55:56,480 --> 00:55:57,829
on the other hand there are
there's another way that people have

3182
00:55:57,829 --> 00:55:57,839
there's another way that people have
 

3183
00:55:57,839 --> 00:55:59,990
there's another way that people have
used science or thought about science as

3184
00:55:59,990 --> 00:56:00,000
used science or thought about science as
 

3185
00:56:00,000 --> 00:56:03,030
used science or thought about science as
a as truth in and of itself

3186
00:56:03,030 --> 00:56:03,040
a as truth in and of itself
 

3187
00:56:03,040 --> 00:56:04,789
a as truth in and of itself
right this like if it's if it's science

3188
00:56:04,789 --> 00:56:04,799
right this like if it's if it's science
 

3189
00:56:04,799 --> 00:56:07,030
right this like if it's if it's science
therefore it's true automatically and

3190
00:56:07,030 --> 00:56:07,040
therefore it's true automatically and
 

3191
00:56:07,040 --> 00:56:08,069
therefore it's true automatically and
they're

3192
00:56:08,069 --> 00:56:08,079
they're
 

3193
00:56:08,079 --> 00:56:10,069
they're
you know what does the science say to do

3194
00:56:10,069 --> 00:56:10,079
you know what does the science say to do
 

3195
00:56:10,079 --> 00:56:11,670
you know what does the science say to do
well the science never says to do

3196
00:56:11,670 --> 00:56:11,680
well the science never says to do
 

3197
00:56:11,680 --> 00:56:13,349
well the science never says to do
anything the science says here's what's

3198
00:56:13,349 --> 00:56:13,359
anything the science says here's what's
 

3199
00:56:13,359 --> 00:56:14,950
anything the science says here's what's
true and then we have to

3200
00:56:14,950 --> 00:56:14,960
true and then we have to
 

3201
00:56:14,960 --> 00:56:17,190
true and then we have to
apply our human values

3202
00:56:17,190 --> 00:56:17,200
apply our human values
 

3203
00:56:17,200 --> 00:56:20,630
apply our human values
to say okay well if we do this well then

3204
00:56:20,630 --> 00:56:20,640
to say okay well if we do this well then
 

3205
00:56:20,640 --> 00:56:22,069
to say okay well if we do this well then
this is likely to happen that's what the

3206
00:56:22,069 --> 00:56:22,079
this is likely to happen that's what the
 

3207
00:56:22,079 --> 00:56:24,230
this is likely to happen that's what the
science says if we do that then that is

3208
00:56:24,230 --> 00:56:24,240
science says if we do that then that is
 

3209
00:56:24,240 --> 00:56:25,829
science says if we do that then that is
likely to happen well we'd rather have

3210
00:56:25,829 --> 00:56:25,839
likely to happen well we'd rather have
 

3211
00:56:25,839 --> 00:56:28,390
likely to happen well we'd rather have
this than that right and but it doesn't

3212
00:56:28,390 --> 00:56:28,400
this than that right and but it doesn't
 

3213
00:56:28,400 --> 00:56:29,750
this than that right and but it doesn't
science doesn't tell us that we'd rather

3214
00:56:29,750 --> 00:56:29,760
science doesn't tell us that we'd rather
 

3215
00:56:29,760 --> 00:56:30,789
science doesn't tell us that we'd rather
have this than that is there human

3216
00:56:30,789 --> 00:56:30,799
have this than that is there human
 

3217
00:56:30,799 --> 00:56:32,069
have this than that is there human
values that tell us that we'd rather

3218
00:56:32,069 --> 00:56:32,079
values that tell us that we'd rather
 

3219
00:56:32,079 --> 00:56:33,910
values that tell us that we'd rather
this and that science plays a role but

3220
00:56:33,910 --> 00:56:33,920
this and that science plays a role but
 

3221
00:56:33,920 --> 00:56:35,589
this and that science plays a role but
it's not the only thing

3222
00:56:35,589 --> 00:56:35,599
it's not the only thing
 

3223
00:56:35,599 --> 00:56:37,750
it's not the only thing
uh it's not the only role it's like it

3224
00:56:37,750 --> 00:56:37,760
uh it's not the only role it's like it
 

3225
00:56:37,760 --> 00:56:39,430
uh it's not the only role it's like it
helps us understand the constraints we

3226
00:56:39,430 --> 00:56:39,440
helps us understand the constraints we
 

3227
00:56:39,440 --> 00:56:41,510
helps us understand the constraints we
face but it doesn't tell us what to do

3228
00:56:41,510 --> 00:56:41,520
face but it doesn't tell us what to do
 

3229
00:56:41,520 --> 00:56:43,109
face but it doesn't tell us what to do
in face of those constraints

3230
00:56:43,109 --> 00:56:43,119
in face of those constraints
 

3231
00:56:43,119 --> 00:56:45,190
in face of those constraints
but underneath it at the individual

3232
00:56:45,190 --> 00:56:45,200
but underneath it at the individual
 

3233
00:56:45,200 --> 00:56:46,950
but underneath it at the individual
level at the institutional level it

3234
00:56:46,950 --> 00:56:46,960
level at the institutional level it
 

3235
00:56:46,960 --> 00:56:48,710
level at the institutional level it
seems like

3236
00:56:48,710 --> 00:56:48,720
seems like
 

3237
00:56:48,720 --> 00:56:49,589
seems like
um

3238
00:56:49,589 --> 00:56:49,599
um
 

3239
00:56:49,599 --> 00:56:51,190
um
arrogance

3240
00:56:51,190 --> 00:56:51,200
arrogance
 

3241
00:56:51,200 --> 00:56:53,430
arrogance
is really destructive so the flip side

3242
00:56:53,430 --> 00:56:53,440
is really destructive so the flip side
 

3243
00:56:53,440 --> 00:56:55,670
is really destructive so the flip side
of that the productive thing is humility

3244
00:56:55,670 --> 00:56:55,680
of that the productive thing is humility
 

3245
00:56:55,680 --> 00:56:58,789
of that the productive thing is humility
so sort of um

3246
00:56:58,789 --> 00:56:58,799
so sort of um
 

3247
00:56:58,799 --> 00:57:01,109
so sort of um

you know 50 million dollars on uh the
 

3325
00:58:22,240 --> 00:58:24,150
you know 50 million dollars on uh the
research in alzheimer's disease this

3331
00:58:28,240 --> 00:58:30,710
whatever it is right some and uh that
pot of money then uh scientists compete

3332
00:58:30,710 --> 00:58:30,720
pot of money then uh scientists compete
 

3333
00:58:30,720 --> 00:58:32,870
pot of money then uh scientists compete
with each other for the best ideas to to

00:58:32,880 --> 00:58:36,230
with each other for the best ideas to to
use it to address that that problem so

3336
00:58:36,230 --> 00:58:36,240
use it to address that that problem so
 

3337
00:58:36,240 --> 00:58:38,789

it's essentially an endeavor to support
 

3339
00:58:38,799 --> 00:58:41,589
it's essentially an endeavor to support
the work of scientists it is not in and

00:59:15,109 --> 00:59:15,119
in effect saying to all scientists you
 

3371
00:59:15,119 --> 00:59:16,950
in effect saying to all scientists you
must agree with me

3372

um is is an understanding of that of
 

3733
01:05:21,440 --> 01:05:23,270
um is is an understanding of that of
that of that person

that of that person
 

3735

i mean i guess the hope is
 

3741
01:05:28,319 --> 01:05:31,190
i mean i guess the hope is
to discover in a sympathetic way a flaw

3742
01:05:31,190 --> 01:05:31,200
to discover in a sympathetic way a flaw
 

3743
01:05:31,200 --> 01:05:33,750
to discover in a sympathetic way a flaw
in a person's thinking together

moment when uh he learned that that
there was quite possible to get a

3790
01:06:14,950 --> 01:06:14,960
there was quite possible to get a
 

3791
01:06:14,960 --> 01:06:17,109
there was quite possible to get a
vaccine going yeah he must have learned

3792
01:06:17,109 --> 01:06:17,119
vaccine going yeah he must have learned
 

3793
01:06:17,119 --> 01:06:18,950
vaccine going yeah he must have learned
that quite early

3794
01:06:18,950 --> 01:06:18,960
that quite early
 

3795
01:06:18,960 --> 01:06:21,349
that quite early

in my experience with vaccine
development it would have take i thought

3804
01:06:29,270 --> 01:06:29,280
development it would have take i thought
 

3805
01:06:29,280 --> 01:06:30,950
development it would have take i thought
it would take a decade or more to get a

3806
01:06:30,950 --> 01:06:30,960
it would take a decade or more to get a
 

3807
01:06:30,960 --> 01:06:32,950
it would take a decade or more to get a
vaccine

yeah well let's talk about the vaccine
what are your thoughts on the safety and

3852
01:07:18,230 --> 01:07:18,240
what are your thoughts on the safety and
 

3853
01:07:18,240 --> 01:07:20,549
what are your thoughts on the safety and
efficacy of covered vaccines at the

3854
01:07:20,549 --> 01:07:20,559
efficacy of covered vaccines at the
 

3855
01:07:20,559 --> 01:07:23,430
efficacy of covered vaccines at the
individual and the societal level so for

3856
01:07:23,430 --> 01:07:23,440
individual and the societal level so for
 

3857
01:07:23,440 --> 01:07:26,150
individual and the societal level so for
the the vaccine safety data

3858
01:07:26,150 --> 01:07:26,160
the the vaccine safety data
 

3859
01:07:26,160 --> 01:07:28,630
the the vaccine safety data
it's it's actually challenging

3860
01:07:28,630 --> 01:07:28,640
it's it's actually challenging
 

3861
01:07:28,640 --> 01:07:30,630
it's it's actually challenging
to convey to the public how this is

to convey to the public how this is
 

3863
01:07:30,640 --> 01:07:32,390
to convey to the public how this is
normally done like normally you would do

3864
01:07:32,390 --> 01:07:32,400
normally done like normally you would do
 

3865
01:07:32,400 --> 01:07:34,470
normally done like normally you would do
this in the context of the trial you'd

3866
01:07:34,470 --> 01:07:34,480
this in the context of the trial you'd
 

3867
01:07:34,480 --> 01:07:36,309
this in the context of the trial you'd
have a law a long trial with large

3868
01:07:36,309 --> 01:07:36,319
have a law a long trial with large
 

3869
01:07:36,319 --> 01:07:37,829
have a law a long trial with large
numbers relatively large numbers of

3870
01:07:37,829 --> 01:07:37,839
numbers relatively large numbers of
 

3871
01:07:37,839 --> 01:07:39,670
numbers relatively large numbers of
people you'd follow them over a long

3872
01:07:39,670 --> 01:07:39,680
people you'd follow them over a long
 

3873
01:07:39,680 --> 01:07:41,029
people you'd follow them over a long
time and the trial will give you some

3874
01:07:41,029 --> 01:07:41,039
time and the trial will give you some
 

3875
01:07:41,039 --> 01:07:43,670
time and the trial will give you some
indication of the safety of the vaccine

3876
01:07:43,670 --> 01:07:43,680
indication of the safety of the vaccine
 

3877
01:07:43,680 --> 01:07:46,230
indication of the safety of the vaccine
and it did um i mean but

3878
01:07:46,230 --> 01:07:46,240
and it did um i mean but
 

3879
01:07:46,240 --> 01:07:48,390
and it did um i mean but
you the the the trial the way it was

3880
01:07:48,390 --> 01:07:48,400
you the the the trial the way it was
 

3881
01:07:48,400 --> 01:07:49,589
you the the the trial the way it was
constructed

3882
01:07:49,589 --> 01:07:49,599
constructed
 

3883
01:07:49,599 --> 01:07:51,510
constructed
when it was came out that it was

3884
01:07:51,510 --> 01:07:51,520
when it was came out that it was
 

3885
01:07:51,520 --> 01:07:53,029
when it was came out that it was
protective against covet it was no

3886
01:07:53,029 --> 01:07:53,039
protective against covet it was no
 

3887
01:07:53,039 --> 01:07:56,230
protective against covet it was no
longer ethical to have a placebo arm

3888
01:07:56,230 --> 01:07:56,240
longer ethical to have a placebo arm
 

3889
01:07:56,240 --> 01:07:57,910
longer ethical to have a placebo arm
and so that placebo arm is vaccinated

3890
01:07:57,910 --> 01:07:57,920
and so that placebo arm is vaccinated
 

3891
01:07:57,920 --> 01:08:00,069
and so that placebo arm is vaccinated
what large part of it

3892
01:08:00,069 --> 01:08:00,079
what large part of it
 

3893
01:08:00,079 --> 01:08:02,150
what large part of it
and so that meant that from the trial

3894
01:08:02,150 --> 01:08:02,160
and so that meant that from the trial
 

3895
01:08:02,160 --> 01:08:04,630
and so that meant that from the trial
you are not going to be able to get

3896
01:08:04,630 --> 01:08:04,640
you are not going to be able to get
 

3897
01:08:04,640 --> 01:08:06,950
you are not going to be able to get
data on the long-term safety profiles of

3898
01:08:06,950 --> 01:08:06,960
data on the long-term safety profiles of
 

3899
01:08:06,960 --> 01:08:08,950
data on the long-term safety profiles of
the vaccine

3900
01:08:08,950 --> 01:08:08,960
the vaccine
 

3901
01:08:08,960 --> 01:08:10,630
the vaccine
uh and also the other thing about trials

3902
01:08:10,630 --> 01:08:10,640
uh and also the other thing about trials
 

3903
01:08:10,640 --> 01:08:12,230
uh and also the other thing about trials
although there's tens of thousands of

3904
01:08:12,230 --> 01:08:12,240
although there's tens of thousands of
 

3905
01:08:12,240 --> 01:08:13,910
although there's tens of thousands of
people enrolled that's still not enough

3906
01:08:13,910 --> 01:08:13,920
people enrolled that's still not enough
 

3907
01:08:13,920 --> 01:08:16,229
people enrolled that's still not enough
to get when you when it when you deploy

3908
01:08:16,229 --> 01:08:16,239
to get when you when it when you deploy
 

3909
01:08:16,239 --> 01:08:18,950
to get when you when it when you deploy
a vaccine to the population scale you're

3910
01:08:18,950 --> 01:08:18,960
a vaccine to the population scale you're
 

3911
01:08:18,960 --> 01:08:20,149
a vaccine to the population scale you're
going to see things that weren't in the

3912
01:08:20,149 --> 01:08:20,159
going to see things that weren't in the
 

3913
01:08:20,159 --> 01:08:21,110
going to see things that weren't in the
trial

3914
01:08:21,110 --> 01:08:21,120
trial
 

3915
01:08:21,120 --> 01:08:22,870
trial
guaranteed

3916
01:08:22,870 --> 01:08:22,880
guaranteed
 

3917
01:08:22,880 --> 01:08:23,990
guaranteed
populations of people that weren't

3918
01:08:23,990 --> 01:08:24,000
populations of people that weren't
 

3919
01:08:24,000 --> 01:08:25,829
populations of people that weren't
represented well in the trial are going

3920
01:08:25,829 --> 01:08:25,839
represented well in the trial are going
 

3921
01:08:25,839 --> 01:08:27,910
represented well in the trial are going
to are going to be given the vaccine and

3922
01:08:27,910 --> 01:08:27,920
to are going to be given the vaccine and
 

3923
01:08:27,920 --> 01:08:29,269
to are going to be given the vaccine and
then that they're going to have things

3924
01:08:29,269 --> 01:08:29,279
then that they're going to have things
 

3925
01:08:29,279 --> 01:08:30,550
then that they're going to have things
that happen to them that you didn't

3926
01:08:30,550 --> 01:08:30,560
that happen to them that you didn't
 

3927
01:08:30,560 --> 01:08:32,229
that happen to them that you didn't
didn't anticipate

3928
01:08:32,229 --> 01:08:32,239
didn't anticipate
 

3929
01:08:32,239 --> 01:08:33,349
didn't anticipate
so

3930
01:08:33,349 --> 01:08:33,359
so
 

3931
01:08:33,359 --> 01:08:35,189
so
i wasn't surprised when people were a

3932
01:08:35,189 --> 01:08:35,199
i wasn't surprised when people were a
 

3933
01:08:35,199 --> 01:08:37,030
i wasn't surprised when people were a
little bit skeptical when the trial was

3934
01:08:37,030 --> 01:08:37,040
little bit skeptical when the trial was
 

3935
01:08:37,040 --> 01:08:38,870
little bit skeptical when the trial was
done about the safety profile just the

3936
01:08:38,870 --> 01:08:38,880
done about the safety profile just the
 

3937
01:08:38,880 --> 01:08:40,229
done about the safety profile just the
way the nature of the thing was going to

3938
01:08:40,229 --> 01:08:40,239
way the nature of the thing was going to
 

3939
01:08:40,239 --> 01:08:42,070
way the nature of the thing was going to
make it so that it was going to be hard

3940
01:08:42,070 --> 01:08:42,080
make it so that it was going to be hard
 

3941
01:08:42,080 --> 01:08:43,829
make it so that it was going to be hard
to get a complete picture from the

3942
01:08:43,829 --> 01:08:43,839
to get a complete picture from the
 

3943
01:08:43,839 --> 01:08:46,070
to get a complete picture from the
trials itself and the trials showed they

3944
01:08:46,070 --> 01:08:46,080
trials itself and the trials showed they
 

3945
01:08:46,080 --> 01:08:47,510
trials itself and the trials showed they
were pretty safe

3946
01:08:47,510 --> 01:08:47,520
were pretty safe
 

3947
01:08:47,520 --> 01:08:50,709
were pretty safe
and quite effective at preventing

3948
01:08:50,709 --> 01:08:50,719
and quite effective at preventing
 

3949
01:08:50,719 --> 01:08:52,950
and quite effective at preventing
both you from getting covid actually i

3950
01:08:52,950 --> 01:08:52,960
both you from getting covid actually i
 

3951
01:08:52,960 --> 01:08:54,470
both you from getting covid actually i
think the main endpoint of the trial

3952
01:08:54,470 --> 01:08:54,480
think the main endpoint of the trial
 

3953
01:08:54,480 --> 01:08:57,510
think the main endpoint of the trial
itself was a symptomatic covet

3954
01:08:57,510 --> 01:08:57,520
itself was a symptomatic covet
 

3955
01:08:57,520 --> 01:09:00,950
itself was a symptomatic covet
right so um uh so that was like that was

3956
01:09:00,950 --> 01:09:00,960
right so um uh so that was like that was
 

3957
01:09:00,960 --> 01:09:03,189
right so um uh so that was like that was
you know i mean it was really um

3958
01:09:03,189 --> 01:09:03,199
you know i mean it was really um
 

3959
01:09:03,199 --> 01:09:05,590
you know i mean it was really um
to me like is about as amazing

3960
01:09:05,590 --> 01:09:05,600
to me like is about as amazing
 

3961
01:09:05,600 --> 01:09:07,110
to me like is about as amazing
achievement as anything organizing a

3962
01:09:07,110 --> 01:09:07,120
achievement as anything organizing a
 

3963
01:09:07,120 --> 01:09:09,510
achievement as anything organizing a
trial of that scale and running it so

3964
01:09:09,510 --> 01:09:09,520
trial of that scale and running it so
 

3965
01:09:09,520 --> 01:09:10,630
trial of that scale and running it so
quickly

3966
01:09:10,630 --> 01:09:10,640
quickly
 

3967
01:09:10,640 --> 01:09:12,950
quickly
and the final results being so

3968
01:09:12,950 --> 01:09:12,960
and the final results being so
 

3969
01:09:12,960 --> 01:09:15,910
and the final results being so
surprisingly high so good right

3970
01:09:15,910 --> 01:09:15,920
surprisingly high so good right
 

3971
01:09:15,920 --> 01:09:17,430
surprisingly high so good right
and um so

3972
01:09:17,430 --> 01:09:17,440
and um so
 

3973
01:09:17,440 --> 01:09:20,709
and um so
the but the problem then was normally it

3974
01:09:20,709 --> 01:09:20,719
the but the problem then was normally it
 

3975
01:09:20,719 --> 01:09:24,070
the but the problem then was normally it
would take a long time the fda would

3976
01:09:24,070 --> 01:09:24,080
would take a long time the fda would
 

3977
01:09:24,080 --> 01:09:25,910
would take a long time the fda would
tell pfizer to go back and try it in

3978
01:09:25,910 --> 01:09:25,920
tell pfizer to go back and try it in
 

3979
01:09:25,920 --> 01:09:28,470
tell pfizer to go back and try it in
this subgroup they'd work more on dosing

3980
01:09:28,470 --> 01:09:28,480
this subgroup they'd work more on dosing
 

3981
01:09:28,480 --> 01:09:30,950
this subgroup they'd work more on dosing
they'd do all these kinds of things

3982
01:09:30,950 --> 01:09:30,960
they'd do all these kinds of things
 

3983
01:09:30,960 --> 01:09:32,550
they'd do all these kinds of things
that kind of didn't we really didn't

3984
01:09:32,550 --> 01:09:32,560
that kind of didn't we really didn't
 

3985
01:09:32,560 --> 01:09:33,669
that kind of didn't we really didn't
have time for in the middle of a

3986
01:09:33,669 --> 01:09:33,679
have time for in the middle of a
 

3987
01:09:33,679 --> 01:09:36,470
have time for in the middle of a
pandemic right so you have a you have

3988
01:09:36,470 --> 01:09:36,480
pandemic right so you have a you have
 

3989
01:09:36,480 --> 01:09:40,390
pandemic right so you have a you have
a basis for approval that it's less

3990
01:09:40,390 --> 01:09:40,400
a basis for approval that it's less
 

3991
01:09:40,400 --> 01:09:42,550
a basis for approval that it's less
full than normally you would have for a

3992
01:09:42,550 --> 01:09:42,560
full than normally you would have for a
 

3993
01:09:42,560 --> 01:09:45,110
full than normally you would have for a
population scale vaccine

3994
01:09:45,110 --> 01:09:45,120
population scale vaccine
 

3995
01:09:45,120 --> 01:09:46,950
population scale vaccine
but the results were good results looked

3996
01:09:46,950 --> 01:09:46,960
but the results were good results looked
 

3997
01:09:46,960 --> 01:09:48,630
but the results were good results looked
really good and actually i should say

3998
01:09:48,630 --> 01:09:48,640
really good and actually i should say
 

3999
01:09:48,640 --> 01:09:51,110
really good and actually i should say
for the most part that's been borne out

4000
01:09:51,110 --> 01:09:51,120
for the most part that's been borne out
 

4001
01:09:51,120 --> 01:09:53,030
for the most part that's been borne out
when we've given the vaccine at scale in

4002
01:09:53,030 --> 01:09:53,040
when we've given the vaccine at scale in
 

4003
01:09:53,040 --> 01:09:54,709
when we've given the vaccine at scale in
terms of protection against severe

4004
01:09:54,709 --> 01:09:54,719
terms of protection against severe
 

4005
01:09:54,719 --> 01:09:55,830
terms of protection against severe
disease

4006
01:09:55,830 --> 01:09:55,840
disease
 

4007
01:09:55,840 --> 01:09:57,590
disease
yeah all right so people who have got

4008
01:09:57,590 --> 01:09:57,600
yeah all right so people who have got
 

4009
01:09:57,600 --> 01:09:58,870
yeah all right so people who have got
the vaccine

4010
01:09:58,870 --> 01:09:58,880
the vaccine
 

4011
01:09:58,880 --> 01:10:00,709
the vaccine
um for a very long time after they've

4012
01:10:00,709 --> 01:10:00,719
um for a very long time after they've
 

4013
01:10:00,719 --> 01:10:02,790
um for a very long time after they've
had that for the full vaccination have

4014
01:10:02,790 --> 01:10:02,800
had that for the full vaccination have
 

4015
01:10:02,800 --> 01:10:05,830
had that for the full vaccination have
had great protection against going being

4016
01:10:05,830 --> 01:10:05,840
had great protection against going being
 

4017
01:10:05,840 --> 01:10:07,590
had great protection against going being
hospitalized and dying if they get

4018
01:10:07,590 --> 01:10:07,600
hospitalized and dying if they get
 

4019
01:10:07,600 --> 01:10:10,310
hospitalized and dying if they get
covered let's separate because this

4020
01:10:10,310 --> 01:10:10,320
covered let's separate because this
 

4021
01:10:10,320 --> 01:10:11,910
covered let's separate because this
seems to be

4022
01:10:11,910 --> 01:10:11,920
seems to be
 

4023
01:10:11,920 --> 01:10:12,790
seems to be
um

4024
01:10:12,790 --> 01:10:12,800
um
 

4025
01:10:12,800 --> 01:10:14,870
um
there's critics of both categories but

4026
01:10:14,870 --> 01:10:14,880
there's critics of both categories but
 

4027
01:10:14,880 --> 01:10:17,110
there's critics of both categories but
different kids

4028
01:10:17,110 --> 01:10:17,120
different kids
 

4029
01:10:17,120 --> 01:10:17,910
different kids
and

4030
01:10:17,910 --> 01:10:17,920
and
 

4031
01:10:17,920 --> 01:10:19,510
and
kids and

4032
01:10:19,510 --> 01:10:19,520
kids and
 

4033
01:10:19,520 --> 01:10:21,830
kids and
old not older people like uh

4034
01:10:21,830 --> 01:10:21,840
old not older people like uh
 

4035
01:10:21,840 --> 01:10:23,830
old not older people like uh
let's say five years old and above or

4036
01:10:23,830 --> 01:10:23,840
let's say five years old and above or
 

4037
01:10:23,840 --> 01:10:25,270
let's say five years old and above or
something like they're 13 years old and

4038
01:10:25,270 --> 01:10:25,280
something like they're 13 years old and
 

4039
01:10:25,280 --> 01:10:27,669
something like they're 13 years old and
above so

4040
01:10:27,669 --> 01:10:27,679
above so
 

4041
01:10:27,679 --> 01:10:31,430
above so
for those it seems like the reduction

4042
01:10:31,430 --> 01:10:31,440
for those it seems like the reduction
 

4043
01:10:31,440 --> 01:10:34,470
for those it seems like the reduction
of uh the rate of fatalities and and

4044
01:10:34,470 --> 01:10:34,480
of uh the rate of fatalities and and
 

4045
01:10:34,480 --> 01:10:36,709
of uh the rate of fatalities and and
serious illness seems to be something

4046
01:10:36,709 --> 01:10:36,719
serious illness seems to be something
 

4047
01:10:36,719 --> 01:10:38,070
serious illness seems to be something
like 10x

4048
01:10:38,070 --> 01:10:38,080
like 10x
 

4049
01:10:38,080 --> 01:10:41,110
like 10x
i mean for older people it is a godsend

4050
01:10:41,110 --> 01:10:41,120
i mean for older people it is a godsend
 

4051
01:10:41,120 --> 01:10:44,709
i mean for older people it is a godsend
this vaccine it it transforms the the

4052
01:10:44,709 --> 01:10:44,719
this vaccine it it transforms the the
 

4053
01:10:44,719 --> 01:10:47,110
this vaccine it it transforms the the
problem of focus protection from

4054
01:10:47,110 --> 01:10:47,120
problem of focus protection from
 

4055
01:10:47,120 --> 01:10:49,110
problem of focus protection from
something that's quite challenging

4056
01:10:49,110 --> 01:10:49,120
something that's quite challenging
 

4057
01:10:49,120 --> 01:10:50,709
something that's quite challenging
possible i believe but quite challenging

4058
01:10:50,709 --> 01:10:50,719
possible i believe but quite challenging
 

4059
01:10:50,719 --> 01:10:51,990
possible i believe but quite challenging
to something that's much much more

4060
01:10:51,990 --> 01:10:52,000
to something that's much much more
 

4061
01:10:52,000 --> 01:10:54,390
to something that's much much more
manageable because the vaccine in and of

4062
01:10:54,390 --> 01:10:54,400
manageable because the vaccine in and of
 

4063
01:10:54,400 --> 01:10:56,470
manageable because the vaccine in and of

populations is a form of focus

4066
01:10:58,070 --> 01:10:58,080
populations is a form of focus

protection
 

4069
01:11:00,000 --> 01:11:02,229
protection
yes well by the way we'll talk about the

4070
01:11:02,229 --> 01:11:02,239
yes well by the way we'll talk about the
 

4071
01:11:02,239 --> 01:11:04,310
yes well by the way we'll talk about the
focus protection in one segment because

4072
01:11:04,310 --> 01:11:04,320
focus protection in one segment because
 

4073
01:11:04,320 --> 01:11:05,990
focus protection in one segment because
it's such a brilliant idea for this

4074
01:11:05,990 --> 01:11:06,000
it's such a brilliant idea for this
 

4075
01:11:06,000 --> 01:11:08,709
it's such a brilliant idea for this
pandemic of future pandemics i thought

collins is um

4082
01:11:15,110 --> 01:11:15,120
collins is um

because it was so recent it was been so

4084
01:11:16,630 --> 01:11:16,640
because it was so recent it was been so
 

4085
01:11:16,640 --> 01:11:18,310
because it was so recent it was been so
troubling to me so i'm glad we talked

4086
01:11:18,310 --> 01:11:18,320
troubling to me so i'm glad we talked
 

4087
01:11:18,320 --> 01:11:20,070
troubling to me so i'm glad we talked
about that first

4088
01:11:20,070 --> 01:11:20,080
about that first
 

4089
01:11:20,080 --> 01:11:23,270
about that first
but so the there seems to be

4090
01:11:23,270 --> 01:11:23,280
but so the there seems to be
 

4091
01:11:23,280 --> 01:11:27,189
but so the there seems to be
the vaccines work to reduce deaths

4092
01:11:27,189 --> 01:11:27,199
the vaccines work to reduce deaths
 

4093
01:11:27,199 --> 01:11:29,669
the vaccines work to reduce deaths
and that has especially the most

4094
01:11:29,669 --> 01:11:29,679
and that has especially the most
 

4095
01:11:29,679 --> 01:11:32,310
and that has especially the most
transformative effects for the older so

4096
01:11:32,310 --> 01:11:32,320
transformative effects for the older so
 

4097
01:11:32,320 --> 01:11:33,750
transformative effects for the older so
can i let you give i've told you one

4098
01:11:33,750 --> 01:11:33,760
can i let you give i've told you one
 

4099
01:11:33,760 --> 01:11:35,030
can i let you give i've told you one
thing that i got wrong in the panic let

4100
01:11:35,030 --> 01:11:35,040
thing that i got wrong in the panic let
 

4101
01:11:35,040 --> 01:11:36,390
thing that i got wrong in the panic let
me tell you the second thing i got wrong

4102
01:11:36,390 --> 01:11:36,400
me tell you the second thing i got wrong
 

4103
01:11:36,400 --> 01:11:38,149
me tell you the second thing i got wrong
for sure in the pandemic

4104
01:11:38,149 --> 01:11:38,159
for sure in the pandemic
 

4105
01:11:38,159 --> 01:11:41,750
for sure in the pandemic
in january of la of this year

4106
01:11:41,750 --> 01:11:41,760
in january of la of this year
 

4107
01:11:41,760 --> 01:11:45,270
in january of la of this year
2021 i thought that the vaccines would

4108
01:11:45,270 --> 01:11:45,280
2021 i thought that the vaccines would
 

4109
01:11:45,280 --> 01:11:47,910
2021 i thought that the vaccines would
stop infection

4110
01:11:47,910 --> 01:11:47,920
stop infection
 

4111
01:11:47,920 --> 01:11:50,229
stop infection
yes right it would would make it so that

4112
01:11:50,229 --> 01:11:50,239
yes right it would would make it so that
 

4113
01:11:50,239 --> 01:11:52,470
yes right it would would make it so that
you were much less likely to be infected

4114
01:11:52,470 --> 01:11:52,480
you were much less likely to be infected
 

4115
01:11:52,480 --> 01:11:53,430
you were much less likely to be infected
at all

4116
01:11:53,430 --> 01:11:53,440
at all
 

4117
01:11:53,440 --> 01:11:55,350
at all
because the the antibodies that were

4118
01:11:55,350 --> 01:11:55,360
because the the antibodies that were
 

4119
01:11:55,360 --> 01:11:56,630
because the the antibodies that were
produced by the vaccines looked like

4120
01:11:56,630 --> 01:11:56,640
produced by the vaccines looked like
 

4121
01:11:56,640 --> 01:11:58,229
produced by the vaccines looked like
they were neutralizing antibodies that

4122
01:11:58,229 --> 01:11:58,239
they were neutralizing antibodies that
 

4123
01:11:58,239 --> 01:11:59,830
they were neutralizing antibodies that
would would essentially block you from

4124
01:11:59,830 --> 01:11:59,840
would would essentially block you from
 

4125
01:11:59,840 --> 01:12:02,790
would would essentially block you from
being infected at all

4126
01:12:02,790 --> 01:12:02,800
being infected at all
 

4127
01:12:02,800 --> 01:12:03,830
being infected at all
um

4128
01:12:03,830 --> 01:12:03,840
um
 

4129
01:12:03,840 --> 01:12:05,830
um
that turned out to be wrong

4130
01:12:05,830 --> 01:12:05,840
that turned out to be wrong
 

4131
01:12:05,840 --> 01:12:09,110
that turned out to be wrong
right so i think it became clear

4132
01:12:09,110 --> 01:12:09,120
right so i think it became clear
 

4133
01:12:09,120 --> 01:12:11,270
right so i think it became clear
as data came out from israel which

4134
01:12:11,270 --> 01:12:11,280
as data came out from israel which
 

4135
01:12:11,280 --> 01:12:12,870
as data came out from israel which
vaccinated very early that they were

4136
01:12:12,870 --> 01:12:12,880
vaccinated very early that they were
 

4137
01:12:12,880 --> 01:12:15,270
vaccinated very early that they were
seeing surges of infection even in a

4138
01:12:15,270 --> 01:12:15,280
seeing surges of infection even in a
 

4139
01:12:15,280 --> 01:12:17,830
seeing surges of infection even in a
very highly vaccinated population

4140
01:12:17,830 --> 01:12:17,840
very highly vaccinated population
 

4141
01:12:17,840 --> 01:12:18,790
very highly vaccinated population
that

4142
01:12:18,790 --> 01:12:18,800
that
 

4143
01:12:18,800 --> 01:12:21,669
that
that the vaccine does not stop infection

4144
01:12:21,669 --> 01:12:21,679
that the vaccine does not stop infection
 

4145
01:12:21,679 --> 01:12:24,390
that the vaccine does not stop infection
so you're a used car salesman and you're

4146
01:12:24,390 --> 01:12:24,400
so you're a used car salesman and you're
 

4147
01:12:24,400 --> 01:12:26,070
so you're a used car salesman and you're
selling the vaccine

4148
01:12:26,070 --> 01:12:26,080
selling the vaccine
 

4149
01:12:26,080 --> 01:12:27,990
selling the vaccine
and the features you thought of vaccine

4150
01:12:27,990 --> 01:12:28,000
and the features you thought of vaccine
 

4151
01:12:28,000 --> 01:12:29,430
and the features you thought of vaccine
would have i mean i have a similar kind

4152
01:12:29,430 --> 01:12:29,440
would have i mean i have a similar kind
 

4153
01:12:29,440 --> 01:12:31,590
would have i mean i have a similar kind
of sense when the vaccine came out

4154
01:12:31,590 --> 01:12:31,600
of sense when the vaccine came out
 

4155
01:12:31,600 --> 01:12:33,510
of sense when the vaccine came out
vaccine would

4156
01:12:33,510 --> 01:12:33,520
vaccine would
 

4157
01:12:33,520 --> 01:12:35,270
vaccine would
reduce

4158
01:12:35,270 --> 01:12:35,280
reduce
 

4159
01:12:35,280 --> 01:12:37,510
reduce
if you somehow were able to get it you

4160
01:12:37,510 --> 01:12:37,520
if you somehow were able to get it you
 

4161
01:12:37,520 --> 01:12:39,189
if you somehow were able to get it you
would reduce rate of death and all those

4162
01:12:39,189 --> 01:12:39,199
would reduce rate of death and all those
 

4163
01:12:39,199 --> 01:12:41,830
would reduce rate of death and all those
kinds of things but it would also reduce

4164
01:12:41,830 --> 01:12:41,840
kinds of things but it would also reduce
 

4165
01:12:41,840 --> 01:12:43,189
kinds of things but it would also reduce
the chance of you

4166
01:12:43,189 --> 01:12:43,199
the chance of you
 

4167
01:12:43,199 --> 01:12:45,750
the chance of you
getting it and if you do get it the

4168
01:12:45,750 --> 01:12:45,760
getting it and if you do get it the
 

4169
01:12:45,760 --> 01:12:47,350
getting it and if you do get it the
chance that you transmitting it to

4170
01:12:47,350 --> 01:12:47,360
chance that you transmitting it to
 

4171
01:12:47,360 --> 01:12:48,790
chance that you transmitting it to
somebody else

4172
01:12:48,790 --> 01:12:48,800
somebody else
 

4173
01:12:48,800 --> 01:12:51,750
somebody else
and it turns out that those latter two

4174
01:12:51,750 --> 01:12:51,760
and it turns out that those latter two
 

4175
01:12:51,760 --> 01:12:54,790
and it turns out that those latter two
things are not as uh definitive or in

4176
01:12:54,790 --> 01:12:54,800
things are not as uh definitive or in
 

4177
01:12:54,800 --> 01:12:56,390
things are not as uh definitive or in
fact they're i mean i don't know to

4178
01:12:56,390 --> 01:12:56,400
fact they're i mean i don't know to
 

4179
01:12:56,400 --> 01:12:57,990
fact they're i mean i don't know to
which agree they're not i mean i think

4180
01:12:57,990 --> 01:12:58,000
which agree they're not i mean i think
 

4181
01:12:58,000 --> 01:12:59,350
which agree they're not i mean i think
it's it's a little complicated because i

4182
01:12:59,350 --> 01:12:59,360
it's it's a little complicated because i
 

4183
01:12:59,360 --> 01:13:01,430
it's it's a little complicated because i
think the first two or three months

4184
01:13:01,430 --> 01:13:01,440
think the first two or three months
 

4185
01:13:01,440 --> 01:13:02,709
think the first two or three months
after you're fully vaccinated after the

4186
01:13:02,709 --> 01:13:02,719
after you're fully vaccinated after the
 

4187
01:13:02,719 --> 01:13:06,310
after you're fully vaccinated after the
second dose you have

4188
01:13:06,310 --> 01:13:06,320
second dose you have
 

4189
01:13:06,320 --> 01:13:08,870
second dose you have
60 70 percent efficacy peak against

4190
01:13:08,870 --> 01:13:08,880
60 70 percent efficacy peak against
 

4191
01:13:08,880 --> 01:13:11,350
60 70 percent efficacy peak against
infection yeah so uh that which is

4192
01:13:11,350 --> 01:13:11,360
infection yeah so uh that which is
 

4193
01:13:11,360 --> 01:13:13,590
infection yeah so uh that which is
pretty good i mean right but by

4194
01:13:13,590 --> 01:13:13,600
pretty good i mean right but by
 

4195
01:13:13,600 --> 01:13:15,990
pretty good i mean right but by
six seven eight months that drops to 20

4196
01:13:15,990 --> 01:13:16,000
six seven eight months that drops to 20
 

4197
01:13:16,000 --> 01:13:18,470
six seven eight months that drops to 20
percent some places some studies like

4198
01:13:18,470 --> 01:13:18,480
percent some places some studies like
 

4199
01:13:18,480 --> 01:13:19,910
percent some places some studies like
there's a study out of sweden suggested

4200
01:13:19,910 --> 01:13:19,920
there's a study out of sweden suggested
 

4201
01:13:19,920 --> 01:13:21,990
there's a study out of sweden suggested
it might even drop to zero but and then

4202
01:13:21,990 --> 01:13:22,000
it might even drop to zero but and then
 

4203
01:13:22,000 --> 01:13:23,830
it might even drop to zero but and then
you're also infectious for some period

4204
01:13:23,830 --> 01:13:23,840
you're also infectious for some period
 

4205
01:13:23,840 --> 01:13:25,910
you're also infectious for some period
of time if you do get it even though

4206
01:13:25,910 --> 01:13:25,920
of time if you do get it even though
 

4207
01:13:25,920 --> 01:13:27,750
of time if you do get it even though
you're vaccinated correct although there

4208
01:13:27,750 --> 01:13:27,760
you're vaccinated correct although there
 

4209
01:13:27,760 --> 01:13:28,950
you're vaccinated correct although there
seems to be

4210
01:13:28,950 --> 01:13:28,960
seems to be
 

4211
01:13:28,960 --> 01:13:30,790
seems to be
lucy data that the period of time your

4212
01:13:30,790 --> 01:13:30,800
lucy data that the period of time your
 

4213
01:13:30,800 --> 01:13:32,950
lucy data that the period of time your
infectious is short it's shorter but the

4214
01:13:32,950 --> 01:13:32,960
infectious is short it's shorter but the
 

4215
01:13:32,960 --> 01:13:36,390
infectious is short it's shorter but the
the infectivity per day is about as high

4216
01:13:36,390 --> 01:13:36,400
the infectivity per day is about as high
 

4217
01:13:36,400 --> 01:13:38,709
the infectivity per day is about as high
so you still it's the point is that that

4218
01:13:38,709 --> 01:13:38,719
so you still it's the point is that that
 

4219
01:13:38,719 --> 01:13:40,950
so you still it's the point is that that
the vaccine might reduce some risk of

4220
01:13:40,950 --> 01:13:40,960
the vaccine might reduce some risk of
 

4221
01:13:40,960 --> 01:13:42,390
the vaccine might reduce some risk of
infecting others but it's not a

4222
01:13:42,390 --> 01:13:42,400
infecting others but it's not a
 

4223
01:13:42,400 --> 01:13:44,709
infecting others but it's not a
categorical difference

4224
01:13:44,709 --> 01:13:44,719
categorical difference
 

4225
01:13:44,719 --> 01:13:48,950
categorical difference
so uh a unvaccine it's not safe to be in

4226
01:13:48,950 --> 01:13:48,960
so uh a unvaccine it's not safe to be in
 

4227
01:13:48,960 --> 01:13:51,110
so uh a unvaccine it's not safe to be in
the presence of just vaccinated people

4228
01:13:51,110 --> 01:13:51,120
the presence of just vaccinated people
 

4229
01:13:51,120 --> 01:13:53,750
the presence of just vaccinated people
you can still get infected

4230
01:13:53,750 --> 01:13:53,760
you can still get infected
 

4231
01:13:53,760 --> 01:13:56,070
you can still get infected
right so i mean there's a million things

4232
01:13:56,070 --> 01:13:56,080
right so i mean there's a million things
 

4233
01:13:56,080 --> 01:13:58,390
right so i mean there's a million things
i want to ask here but

4234
01:13:58,390 --> 01:13:58,400
i want to ask here but
 

4235
01:13:58,400 --> 01:14:00,229
i want to ask here but
is there in some sense because the

4236
01:14:00,229 --> 01:14:00,239
is there in some sense because the
 

4237
01:14:00,239 --> 01:14:01,590
is there in some sense because the
vaccine

4238
01:14:01,590 --> 01:14:01,600
vaccine
 

4239
01:14:01,600 --> 01:14:02,870
vaccine
um

4240
01:14:02,870 --> 01:14:02,880
um
 

4241
01:14:02,880 --> 01:14:05,430
um
really helps on the worst

4242
01:14:05,430 --> 01:14:05,440
really helps on the worst
 

4243
01:14:05,440 --> 01:14:07,590
really helps on the worst
part of this pandemic which is killing

4244
01:14:07,590 --> 01:14:07,600
part of this pandemic which is killing
 

4245
01:14:07,600 --> 01:14:09,510
part of this pandemic which is killing
people yes

4246
01:14:09,510 --> 01:14:09,520
people yes
 

4247
01:14:09,520 --> 01:14:11,350
people yes
uh doesn't that mean

4248
01:14:11,350 --> 01:14:11,360
uh doesn't that mean
 

4249
01:14:11,360 --> 01:14:14,470
uh doesn't that mean
uh where does the vaccine hesitancy come

4250
01:14:14,470 --> 01:14:14,480
uh where does the vaccine hesitancy come
 

4251
01:14:14,480 --> 01:14:15,510
uh where does the vaccine hesitancy come
from

4252
01:14:15,510 --> 01:14:15,520
from
 

4253
01:14:15,520 --> 01:14:18,229
from
in terms of it seems like obviously a

4254
01:14:18,229 --> 01:14:18,239
in terms of it seems like obviously a
 

4255
01:14:18,239 --> 01:14:21,189
in terms of it seems like obviously a
vaccine is a powerful solution to let us

4256
01:14:21,189 --> 01:14:21,199
vaccine is a powerful solution to let us
 

4257
01:14:21,199 --> 01:14:23,350
vaccine is a powerful solution to let us
open this thing up yeah so i wrote a

4258
01:14:23,350 --> 01:14:23,360
open this thing up yeah so i wrote a
 

4259
01:14:23,360 --> 01:14:24,950
open this thing up yeah so i wrote a
wall street journal op-ed with sinatra

4260
01:14:24,950 --> 01:14:24,960
wall street journal op-ed with sinatra
 

4261
01:14:24,960 --> 01:14:27,669
wall street journal op-ed with sinatra
gupta in december of last year yes a

4262
01:14:27,669 --> 01:14:27,679
gupta in december of last year yes a
 

4263
01:14:27,679 --> 01:14:29,830
gupta in december of last year yes a
very night with a very naive title which

4264
01:14:29,830 --> 01:14:29,840
very night with a very naive title which
 

4265
01:14:29,840 --> 01:14:32,229
very night with a very naive title which
says we can end the lockdowns in a month

4266
01:14:32,229 --> 01:14:32,239
says we can end the lockdowns in a month
 

4267
01:14:32,239 --> 01:14:33,830
says we can end the lockdowns in a month
and the idea is very simple

4268
01:14:33,830 --> 01:14:33,840
and the idea is very simple
 

4269
01:14:33,840 --> 01:14:35,110
and the idea is very simple
vaccinate

4270
01:14:35,110 --> 01:14:35,120
vaccinate
 

4271
01:14:35,120 --> 01:14:36,550
vaccinate
all

4272
01:14:36,550 --> 01:14:36,560
all
 

4273
01:14:36,560 --> 01:14:39,110
all
vulnerable people

4274
01:14:39,110 --> 01:14:39,120
vulnerable people
 

4275
01:14:39,120 --> 01:14:40,070
vulnerable people
and then

4276
01:14:40,070 --> 01:14:40,080
and then
 

4277
01:14:40,080 --> 01:14:42,390
and then
open up open up right uh and the idea

4278
01:14:42,390 --> 01:14:42,400
open up open up right uh and the idea
 

4279
01:14:42,400 --> 01:14:44,630
open up open up right uh and the idea
was that uh the the lockdown harms this

4280
01:14:44,630 --> 01:14:44,640
was that uh the the lockdown harms this
 

4281
01:14:44,640 --> 01:14:45,910
was that uh the the lockdown harms this
is related this is directly related to

4282
01:14:45,910 --> 01:14:45,920
is related this is directly related to
 

4283
01:14:45,920 --> 01:14:46,950
is related this is directly related to
the great barrington declaration the

4284
01:14:46,950 --> 01:14:46,960
the great barrington declaration the
 

4285
01:14:46,960 --> 01:14:49,030
the great barrington declaration the
great antarctic clergy said the lockdown

4286
01:14:49,030 --> 01:14:49,040
great antarctic clergy said the lockdown
 

4287
01:14:49,040 --> 01:14:51,030
great antarctic clergy said the lockdown
harms are devastating

4288
01:14:51,030 --> 01:14:51,040
harms are devastating
 

4289
01:14:51,040 --> 01:14:53,189
harms are devastating
to the population at large

4290
01:14:53,189 --> 01:14:53,199
to the population at large
 

4291
01:14:53,199 --> 01:14:54,550
to the population at large
there's this

4292
01:14:54,550 --> 01:14:54,560
there's this
 

4293
01:14:54,560 --> 01:14:56,070
there's this
considerable segment of people that are

4294
01:14:56,070 --> 01:14:56,080
considerable segment of people that are
 

4295
01:14:56,080 --> 01:14:57,189
considerable segment of people that are
vulnerable

4296
01:14:57,189 --> 01:14:57,199
vulnerable
 

4297
01:14:57,199 --> 01:14:59,030
vulnerable
protect them well with the vaccine we

4298
01:14:59,030 --> 01:14:59,040
protect them well with the vaccine we
 

4299
01:14:59,040 --> 01:15:00,630
protect them well with the vaccine we
have a perfect tool to protect the

4300
01:15:00,630 --> 01:15:00,640
have a perfect tool to protect the
 

4301
01:15:00,640 --> 01:15:02,630
have a perfect tool to protect the
vulnerable which is i still believe i

4302
01:15:02,630 --> 01:15:02,640
vulnerable which is i still believe i
 

4303
01:15:02,640 --> 01:15:05,510
vulnerable which is i still believe i
mean is true right you vaccinate the

4304
01:15:05,510 --> 01:15:05,520
mean is true right you vaccinate the
 

4305
01:15:05,520 --> 01:15:07,590
mean is true right you vaccinate the
vulnerable the older population and as

4306
01:15:07,590 --> 01:15:07,600
vulnerable the older population and as
 

4307
01:15:07,600 --> 01:15:09,270
vulnerable the older population and as
you said there's a tenfold decrease in

4308
01:15:09,270 --> 01:15:09,280
you said there's a tenfold decrease in
 

4309
01:15:09,280 --> 01:15:10,870
you said there's a tenfold decrease in
the mortality risk

4310
01:15:10,870 --> 01:15:10,880
the mortality risk
 

4311
01:15:10,880 --> 01:15:13,030
the mortality risk
um from getting infected

4312
01:15:13,030 --> 01:15:13,040
um from getting infected
 

4313
01:15:13,040 --> 01:15:15,350
um from getting infected
which is i mean amazing so that was the

4314
01:15:15,350 --> 01:15:15,360
which is i mean amazing so that was the
 

4315
01:15:15,360 --> 01:15:17,350
which is i mean amazing so that was the
strategy we got we outlined what

4316
01:15:17,350 --> 01:15:17,360
strategy we got we outlined what
 

4317
01:15:17,360 --> 01:15:19,669
strategy we got we outlined what
happened is that the vaccine debate got

4318
01:15:19,669 --> 01:15:19,679
happened is that the vaccine debate got
 

4319
01:15:19,679 --> 01:15:21,750
happened is that the vaccine debate got
transformed so first there's so you're

4320
01:15:21,750 --> 01:15:21,760
transformed so first there's so you're
 

4321
01:15:21,760 --> 01:15:22,950
transformed so first there's so you're
asking about vaccine hesitance i think

4322
01:15:22,950 --> 01:15:22,960
asking about vaccine hesitance i think
 

4323
01:15:22,960 --> 01:15:24,070
asking about vaccine hesitance i think
there's there's first there's like

4324
01:15:24,070 --> 01:15:24,080
there's there's first there's like
 

4325
01:15:24,080 --> 01:15:26,149
there's there's first there's like
there's there's the inherent

4326
01:15:26,149 --> 01:15:26,159
there's there's the inherent
 

4327
01:15:26,159 --> 01:15:28,550
there's there's the inherent
limitations of how to measure vaccine

4328
01:15:28,550 --> 01:15:28,560
limitations of how to measure vaccine
 

4329
01:15:28,560 --> 01:15:30,310
limitations of how to measure vaccine
safety right so we talked about a little

4330
01:15:30,310 --> 01:15:30,320
safety right so we talked about a little
 

4331
01:15:30,320 --> 01:15:32,470
safety right so we talked about a little
bit about the trial but also after the

4332
01:15:32,470 --> 01:15:32,480
bit about the trial but also after the
 

4333
01:15:32,480 --> 01:15:34,149
bit about the trial but also after the
trial there's a there's a there's a

4334
01:15:34,149 --> 01:15:34,159
trial there's a there's a there's a
 

4335
01:15:34,159 --> 01:15:36,229
trial there's a there's a there's a
mechanism and this is the work i've been

4336
01:15:36,229 --> 01:15:36,239
mechanism and this is the work i've been
 

4337
01:15:36,239 --> 01:15:38,870
mechanism and this is the work i've been
involved with before covet on

4338
01:15:38,870 --> 01:15:38,880
involved with before covet on
 

4339
01:15:38,880 --> 01:15:41,669
involved with before covet on
on tracking and and identifying and

4340
01:15:41,669 --> 01:15:41,679
on tracking and and identifying and
 

4341
01:15:41,679 --> 01:15:43,430
on tracking and and identifying and
checking whether the vaccines actually

4342
01:15:43,430 --> 01:15:43,440
checking whether the vaccines actually
 

4343
01:15:43,440 --> 01:15:45,189
checking whether the vaccines actually
are safe and the central challenge is

4344
01:15:45,189 --> 01:15:45,199
are safe and the central challenge is
 

4345
01:15:45,199 --> 01:15:47,030
are safe and the central challenge is
one of causality

4346
01:15:47,030 --> 01:15:47,040
one of causality
 

4347
01:15:47,040 --> 01:15:48,470
one of causality
so you no longer have the randomized

4348
01:15:48,470 --> 01:15:48,480
so you no longer have the randomized
 

4349
01:15:48,480 --> 01:15:50,390
so you no longer have the randomized
trial

4350
01:15:50,390 --> 01:15:50,400
trial
 

4351
01:15:50,400 --> 01:15:52,630
trial
but but you want to know is the vaccine

4352
01:15:52,630 --> 01:15:52,640
but but you want to know is the vaccine
 

4353
01:15:52,640 --> 01:15:54,630
but but you want to know is the vaccine
when is deployed at scale

4354
01:15:54,630 --> 01:15:54,640
when is deployed at scale

01:15:57,750 --> 01:15:57,760
adverse events
 

4359
01:15:57,760 --> 01:15:59,270
adverse events
well you can't just look at people who

4360
01:15:59,270 --> 01:15:59,280
well you can't just look at people who
 

4361
01:15:59,280 --> 01:16:00,709
well you can't just look at people who
are vaccinated and see what adverse

4362
01:16:00,709 --> 01:16:00,719
are vaccinated and see what adverse
 

4363
01:16:00,719 --> 01:16:01,910
are vaccinated and see what adverse
events happen

4364
01:16:01,910 --> 01:16:01,920
events happen
 

4365
01:16:01,920 --> 01:16:03,030
events happen
because you don't know what would have

4366
01:16:03,030 --> 01:16:03,040
because you don't know what would have
 

4367
01:16:03,040 --> 01:16:05,110
because you don't know what would have
happened if the person had not been

4368
01:16:05,110 --> 01:16:05,120
happened if the person had not been
 

4369
01:16:05,120 --> 01:16:06,870
happened if the person had not been
vaccinated

4370
01:16:06,870 --> 01:16:06,880
vaccinated
 

4371
01:16:06,880 --> 01:16:09,750
vaccinated
so you have to have some control group

4372
01:16:09,750 --> 01:16:09,760
so you have to have some control group
 

4373
01:16:09,760 --> 01:16:11,430
so you have to have some control group
now what happened is there's several

4374
01:16:11,430 --> 01:16:11,440
now what happened is there's several
 

4375
01:16:11,440 --> 01:16:13,669
now what happened is there's several
systems to do to check this in that the

4376
01:16:13,669 --> 01:16:13,679
systems to do to check this in that the
 

4377
01:16:13,679 --> 01:16:16,550
systems to do to check this in that the
cdc uses one one very very very commonly

4378
01:16:16,550 --> 01:16:16,560
cdc uses one one very very very commonly
 

4379
01:16:16,560 --> 01:16:18,149
cdc uses one one very very very commonly
known one now is called vares the

4380
01:16:18,149 --> 01:16:18,159
known one now is called vares the
 

4381
01:16:18,159 --> 01:16:20,470
known one now is called vares the
vaccine adverse event reporting system

4382
01:16:20,470 --> 01:16:20,480
vaccine adverse event reporting system
 

4383
01:16:20,480 --> 01:16:22,630
vaccine adverse event reporting system
there anyone who has an adverse event

4384
01:16:22,630 --> 01:16:22,640
there anyone who has an adverse event
 

4385
01:16:22,640 --> 01:16:24,470
there anyone who has an adverse event
that either either a regular person or a

4386
01:16:24,470 --> 01:16:24,480
that either either a regular person or a
 

4387
01:16:24,480 --> 01:16:27,030
that either either a regular person or a
doctor can just go report look i have

4388
01:16:27,030 --> 01:16:27,040
doctor can just go report look i have
 

4389
01:16:27,040 --> 01:16:28,470
doctor can just go report look i have
the vaccine and two days later i had a

4390
01:16:28,470 --> 01:16:28,480
the vaccine and two days later i had a
 

4391
01:16:28,480 --> 01:16:30,630
the vaccine and two days later i had a
headache or whatever it is

4392
01:16:30,630 --> 01:16:30,640
headache or whatever it is
 

4393
01:16:30,640 --> 01:16:31,910
headache or whatever it is
the person died

4394
01:16:31,910 --> 01:16:31,920
the person died
 

4395
01:16:31,920 --> 01:16:34,630
the person died
a day after the vaccine right um now you

4396
01:16:34,630 --> 01:16:34,640
a day after the vaccine right um now you
 

4397
01:16:34,640 --> 01:16:36,149
a day after the vaccine right um now you
vaccinate that the vaccine was rolled

4398
01:16:36,149 --> 01:16:36,159
vaccinate that the vaccine was rolled
 

4399
01:16:36,159 --> 01:16:38,630
vaccinate that the vaccine was rolled
out to older people first

4400
01:16:38,630 --> 01:16:38,640
out to older people first
 

4401
01:16:38,640 --> 01:16:41,189
out to older people first
and older people die sometimes with or

4402
01:16:41,189 --> 01:16:41,199
and older people die sometimes with or
 

4403
01:16:41,199 --> 01:16:43,030
and older people die sometimes with or
without the vaccine so

4404
01:16:43,030 --> 01:16:43,040
without the vaccine so
 

4405
01:16:43,040 --> 01:16:44,070
without the vaccine so
sometimes you'll see someone's

4406
01:16:44,070 --> 01:16:44,080
sometimes you'll see someone's
 

4407
01:16:44,080 --> 01:16:46,550
sometimes you'll see someone's
vaccinated and a few days later they die

4408
01:16:46,550 --> 01:16:46,560
vaccinated and a few days later they die
 

4409
01:16:46,560 --> 01:16:48,070
vaccinated and a few days later they die
did the vaccine cause it or something

4410
01:16:48,070 --> 01:16:48,080
did the vaccine cause it or something
 

4411
01:16:48,080 --> 01:16:50,149
did the vaccine cause it or something
else cause it's really difficult to tell

4412
01:16:50,149 --> 01:16:50,159
else cause it's really difficult to tell
 

4413
01:16:50,159 --> 01:16:51,590
else cause it's really difficult to tell
in order to tell you need a control

4414
01:16:51,590 --> 01:16:51,600
in order to tell you need a control
 

4415
01:16:51,600 --> 01:16:53,430
in order to tell you need a control
group

4417
01:16:53,440 --> 01:16:55,189

for that um

4418
01:16:55,189 --> 01:16:55,199
for that um
 

4419
01:16:55,199 --> 01:16:57,350
for that um
there are other systems the fda and cdc

4420
01:16:57,350 --> 01:16:57,360
there are other systems the fda and cdc
 

4421
01:16:57,360 --> 01:16:58,149
there are other systems the fda and cdc
have

4422
01:16:58,149 --> 01:16:58,159
have
 

4423
01:16:58,159 --> 01:17:00,550
have
uh like there's one called vsd vaccine

4424
01:17:00,550 --> 01:17:00,560
uh like there's one called vsd vaccine
 

4425
01:17:00,560 --> 01:17:02,870
uh like there's one called vsd vaccine
safety data link there's another system

4426
01:17:02,870 --> 01:17:02,880
safety data link there's another system
 

4427
01:17:02,880 --> 01:17:04,070
safety data link there's another system
called best

4428
01:17:04,070 --> 01:17:04,080

01:17:07,430 --> 01:17:07,440
i forget the app with the acronym is to
 

4433
01:17:07,440 --> 01:17:10,149
i forget the app with the acronym is to
essentially to track uh cohorts of

careful of matching as you can do it's

4440
01:17:15,669 --> 01:17:15,679
careful of matching as you can do it's
 

4441
01:17:15,679 --> 01:17:18,310
careful of matching as you can do it's
not randomized but and then c

4442
01:17:18,310 --> 01:17:18,320
not randomized but and then c
 

4443
01:17:18,320 --> 01:17:20,070
not randomized but and then c
if you have

4444
01:17:20,070 --> 01:17:20,080
if you have
 

4445
01:17:20,080 --> 01:17:22,709
if you have
safety signals that pop up in the

4446
01:17:22,709 --> 01:17:22,719
safety signals that pop up in the
 

4447
01:17:22,719 --> 01:17:24,630
safety signals that pop up in the
vaccinated relative to the control group

4448
01:17:24,630 --> 01:17:24,640

unvaccinated
 

4451
01:17:26,320 --> 01:17:29,110
unvaccinated
um and so that's for instance how the

4452
01:17:29,110 --> 01:17:29,120
um and so that's for instance how the
 

4453
01:17:29,120 --> 01:17:31,830
um and so that's for instance how the
the the myocarditis risk was picked up

4454
01:17:31,830 --> 01:17:31,840
the the myocarditis risk was picked up
 

4455
01:17:31,840 --> 01:17:34,070
the the myocarditis risk was picked up
in young young especially young men

4456
01:17:34,070 --> 01:17:34,080
in young young especially young men
 

4457
01:17:34,080 --> 01:17:35,990
in young young especially young men
it's also how the

4458
01:17:35,990 --> 01:17:36,000
it's also how the
 

4459
01:17:36,000 --> 01:17:38,950
it's also how the
higher risk of blood clots in middle age

4460
01:17:38,950 --> 01:17:38,960
higher risk of blood clots in middle age
 

4461
01:17:38,960 --> 01:17:41,910
higher risk of blood clots in middle age
and older women in with the jnj vaccine

4462
01:17:41,910 --> 01:17:41,920
and older women in with the jnj vaccine
 

4463
01:17:41,920 --> 01:17:42,830
and older women in with the jnj vaccine
is picked

4464
01:17:42,830 --> 01:17:42,840
is picked
 

4465
01:17:42,840 --> 01:17:46,310
is picked
up there what you have is are situations

4466
01:17:46,310 --> 01:17:46,320
up there what you have is are situations
 

4467
01:17:46,320 --> 01:17:48,550
up there what you have is are situations
where the baseline risk of these

4468
01:17:48,550 --> 01:17:48,560
where the baseline risk of these
 

4469
01:17:48,560 --> 01:17:51,430
where the baseline risk of these
outcomes are so low that if you see them

4470
01:17:51,430 --> 01:17:51,440
outcomes are so low that if you see them
 

4471
01:17:51,440 --> 01:17:53,990
outcomes are so low that if you see them
in the con in the vaccinated arm at all

4472
01:17:53,990 --> 01:17:54,000
in the con in the vaccinated arm at all
 

4473
01:17:54,000 --> 01:17:55,430
in the con in the vaccinated arm at all
then it's not hard to understand that

4474
01:17:55,430 --> 01:17:55,440
then it's not hard to understand that
 

4475
01:17:55,440 --> 01:17:57,350
then it's not hard to understand that
the vaccine did this right

4476
01:17:57,350 --> 01:17:57,360
the vaccine did this right
 

4477
01:17:57,360 --> 01:17:58,870
the vaccine did this right
young men should not be having

4478
01:17:58,870 --> 01:17:58,880
young men should not be having
 

4479
01:17:58,880 --> 01:18:00,470
young men should not be having
myocarditis

4480
01:18:00,470 --> 01:18:00,480
myocarditis
 

4481
01:18:00,480 --> 01:18:02,149
myocarditis
middle-aged women should not be having

4482
01:18:02,149 --> 01:18:02,159
middle-aged women should not be having
 

4483
01:18:02,159 --> 01:18:04,229
middle-aged women should not be having
huge blood clots in the brain right um

4484
01:18:04,229 --> 01:18:04,239
huge blood clots in the brain right um
 

4485
01:18:04,239 --> 01:18:05,510
huge blood clots in the brain right um
so when you see that you can say it's

4486
01:18:05,510 --> 01:18:05,520
so when you see that you can say it's
 

4487
01:18:05,520 --> 01:18:07,750
so when you see that you can say it's
linked now the rates are low so young

4488
01:18:07,750 --> 01:18:07,760
linked now the rates are low so young
 

4489
01:18:07,760 --> 01:18:09,750
linked now the rates are low so young
men maybe one in five thousand one in

4490
01:18:09,750 --> 01:18:09,760
men maybe one in five thousand one in
 

4491
01:18:09,760 --> 01:18:11,750
men maybe one in five thousand one in
ten thousand of the vaccine of my

um young women of middle-aged women i
 

4497
01:18:17,199 --> 01:18:18,870
um young women of middle-aged women i
don't know i don't i'm not sure what the

4498
01:18:18,870 --> 01:18:18,880
don't know i don't i'm not sure what the
 

4499
01:18:18,880 --> 01:18:20,229
don't know i don't i'm not sure what the
right number might be but like i'd say

4500
01:18:20,229 --> 01:18:20,239
right number might be but like i'd say
 

4501
01:18:20,239 --> 01:18:22,229
right number might be but like i'd say
it's like in the you know one in

it's like in the you know one in
 

4503
01:18:22,239 --> 01:18:23,990
it's like in the you know one in
hundreds of thousands something like

4504
01:18:23,990 --> 01:18:24,000
hundreds of thousands something like
 

4505
01:18:24,000 --> 01:18:26,310
hundreds of thousands something like
that

4506
01:18:26,310 --> 01:18:26,320
that
 

4507
01:18:26,320 --> 01:18:28,149

they're they are vaccinating linked
 

4511
01:18:29,679 --> 01:18:30,870
they're they are vaccinating linked
outcomes

01:18:30,870 --> 01:18:30,880
outcomes
 

4513
01:18:30,880 --> 01:18:33,430

uh those groups and so

4630
01:20:39,510 --> 01:20:39,520

 

4631
01:20:39,520 --> 01:20:41,110

the question i want to ask is like what

4632
01:20:41,110 --> 01:20:41,120
the question i want to ask is like what
 

4633
01:20:41,120 --> 01:20:43,430
the question i want to ask is like what
do you think about these

4634

do you think about these
 

4635

uh two

4636
01:20:44,830 --> 01:20:44,840
uh two
 

4637
01:20:44,840 --> 01:20:47,830
uh two
groups and this kind of tension over the

4638
01:20:47,830 --> 01:20:47,840
groups and this kind of tension over the
 

4639
01:20:47,840 --> 01:20:49,750
groups and this kind of tension over the
vaccine

4640
01:20:49,750 --> 01:20:49,760
vaccine
 

4641
01:20:49,760 --> 01:20:51,669
vaccine
that sometimes it just keeps finding

4642
01:20:51,669 --> 01:20:51,679
that sometimes it just keeps finding
 

4643
01:20:51,679 --> 01:20:53,990
that sometimes it just keeps finding
different topics

4644
01:20:53,990 --> 01:20:54,000
different topics
 

4645
01:20:54,000 --> 01:20:56,070
different topics
on which to focus on like whether kids

4646
01:20:56,070 --> 01:20:56,080
on which to focus on like whether kids
 

4647
01:20:56,080 --> 01:20:57,990
on which to focus on like whether kids
should get vaccinated or not whether

4648
01:20:57,990 --> 01:20:58,000
should get vaccinated or not whether
 

4649
01:20:58,000 --> 01:21:00,229
should get vaccinated or not whether
there should be vaccine mandates or not

4650
01:21:00,229 --> 01:21:00,239
there should be vaccine mandates or not
 

4651
01:21:00,239 --> 01:21:02,229
there should be vaccine mandates or not
which seem to be often very kind of

4652
01:21:02,229 --> 01:21:02,239
which seem to be often very kind of
 

4653
01:21:02,239 --> 01:21:04,870
which seem to be often very kind of
specific policy kinds of questions right

4654
01:21:04,870 --> 01:21:04,880
specific policy kinds of questions right
 

4655
01:21:04,880 --> 01:21:06,950
specific policy kinds of questions right
it's the bigger picture i think it's a

4656
01:21:06,950 --> 01:21:06,960
it's the bigger picture i think it's a
 

4657
01:21:06,960 --> 01:21:08,870
it's the bigger picture i think it's a
symptom of the distrust that people have

4658
01:21:08,870 --> 01:21:08,880
symptom of the distrust that people have
 

4659
01:21:08,880 --> 01:21:10,310
symptom of the distrust that people have
in public health

4660
01:21:10,310 --> 01:21:10,320
in public health
 

4661
01:21:10,320 --> 01:21:13,189
in public health
i think this kind of schism over the the

4662
01:21:13,189 --> 01:21:13,199
i think this kind of schism over the the
 

4663
01:21:13,199 --> 01:21:15,270
i think this kind of schism over the the
vaccine does not happen in places where

4664
01:21:15,270 --> 01:21:15,280

manufacture the discovery of the vaccine
 

5013
01:27:06,560 --> 01:27:08,790
manufacture the discovery of the vaccine
and then the manufacturing at scale

5014
01:27:08,790 --> 01:27:08,800
and then the manufacturing at scale
 

5015
01:27:08,800 --> 01:27:10,149
and then the manufacturing at scale
so that

5016
01:27:10,149 --> 01:27:10,159
so that
 

5017
01:27:10,159 --> 01:27:11,910
so that
you know billions of people can take the

you know billions of people can take the
 

5019
01:27:11,920 --> 01:27:14,070
you know billions of people can take the
vaccine in a relatively short time that

5020
01:27:14,070 --> 01:27:14,080
vaccine in a relatively short time that
 

5021
01:27:14,080 --> 01:27:15,910
vaccine in a relatively short time that
is a remarkable achievement that could

other things like that you have to
acknowledge that there's a very large

period yeah well i mean i think here
 

5107
01:28:47,040 --> 01:28:48,470
period yeah well i mean i think here
here take ivermectin right there's

5108
01:28:48,470 --> 01:28:48,480
here take ivermectin right there's
 

5109
01:28:48,480 --> 01:28:50,470
here take ivermectin right there's
actually a study

5110
01:28:50,470 --> 01:28:50,480
actually a study
 

5111
01:28:50,480 --> 01:28:54,229
actually a study
funded by the nih by tony fauci's nia id

5112

and the nih
 

5115
01:28:55,520 --> 01:28:58,149
and the nih
um called active six

01:28:58,149 --> 01:28:58,159
um called active six
 

5117
01:28:58,159 --> 01:28:58,950
um called active six
that's

5118
01:28:58,950 --> 01:28:58,960
that's
 

5119
01:28:58,960 --> 01:29:02,629
that's
a randomized trial of ivermectin

5120
01:29:02,629 --> 01:29:02,639
a randomized trial of ivermectin
 

5121
01:29:02,639 --> 01:29:07,110
a randomized trial of ivermectin
it's due to be completed in march 2023

benefit
 

5135
01:29:18,560 --> 01:29:20,310
benefit
it's the job of the of the the

5136
01:29:20,310 --> 01:29:20,320
it's the job of the of the the
 

5137
01:29:20,320 --> 01:29:22,149
it's the job of the of the the
government and in this case the nih to

5138
01:29:22,149 --> 01:29:22,159
government and in this case the nih to
 

5139
01:29:22,159 --> 01:29:25,870
government and in this case the nih to
fund that kind of work the nih has been

5140
01:29:25,870 --> 01:29:25,880
fund that kind of work the nih has been
 

5141
01:29:25,880 --> 01:29:29,110
fund that kind of work the nih has been
incredibly slow

5142

incredibly slow
 

5143
01:29:29,120 --> 01:29:31,590
incredibly slow

of uneven quality
 

5153
01:29:39,440 --> 01:29:40,870
of uneven quality
and hence that's why you have these

5154
01:29:40,870 --> 01:29:40,880
and hence that's why you have these
 

5155
01:29:40,880 --> 01:29:42,229
and hence that's why you have these
these big fights

5156
01:29:42,229 --> 01:29:42,239
these big fights
 

5157
01:29:42,239 --> 01:29:44,229
these big fights
because the data are not solid you're

5158
01:29:44,229 --> 01:29:44,239
because the data are not solid you're
 

5159
01:29:44,239 --> 01:29:46,470
because the data are not solid you're
gonna have these big fights yeah but

5160
01:29:46,470 --> 01:29:46,480
gonna have these big fights yeah but
 

5161
01:29:46,480 --> 01:29:49,110
gonna have these big fights yeah but
also okay forget the the process of

5162
01:29:49,110 --> 01:29:49,120
also okay forget the the process of
 

5163
01:29:49,120 --> 01:29:51,910
also okay forget the the process of
science here the studies not enough

5164
01:29:51,910 --> 01:29:51,920
science here the studies not enough
 

5165
01:29:51,920 --> 01:29:53,590
science here the studies not enough
effort being put into the studies just

5166
01:29:53,590 --> 01:29:53,600
effort being put into the studies just
 

5167
01:29:53,600 --> 01:29:55,510
effort being put into the studies just
the way it's being communicated yeah no

5168
01:29:55,510 --> 01:29:55,520
the way it's being communicated yeah no
 

5169
01:29:55,520 --> 01:29:58,149
the way it's being communicated yeah no

like
they're taking iron mechanism because

5176
01:30:02,950 --> 01:30:02,960
they're taking iron mechanism because
 

5177
01:30:02,960 --> 01:30:04,149
they're taking iron mechanism because
they've heard good things about it and

5178

the the
less than stellar way that our

5198
01:30:26,310 --> 01:30:26,320
less than stellar way that our
 

5199
01:30:26,320 --> 01:30:28,229
less than stellar way that our
scientific leaders and our political

5200

scientific leaders and our political
 

5201
01:30:28,239 --> 01:30:29,910
scientific leaders and our political
leaders are behaving and then the new

5202

leaders are behaving and then the new
 

5203
01:30:29,920 --> 01:30:32,149
leaders are behaving and then the new
generation will not repeat the mistakes

5204

5217
01:30:45,440 --> 01:30:46,629
um that's my hope um in the space of
science

5218

lockdowns just paint the picture of this
 

5239
01:31:06,239 --> 01:31:08,390
lockdowns just paint the picture of this
early proposal sure so uh the great

5240
01:31:08,390 --> 01:31:08,400
early proposal sure so uh the great
 

5241
01:31:08,400 --> 01:31:09,750
early proposal sure so uh the great
painting declaration first why is it

5242
01:31:09,750 --> 01:31:09,760
painting declaration first why is it
 

5243
01:31:09,760 --> 01:31:11,430
painting declaration first why is it
called great barrington declaration it

5244
01:31:11,430 --> 01:31:11,440
called great barrington declaration it
 

5245
01:31:11,440 --> 01:31:13,590
called great barrington declaration it
sounds it's such a great name

5246
01:31:13,590 --> 01:31:13,600
sounds it's such a great name
 

5247
01:31:13,600 --> 01:31:14,470
sounds it's such a great name
you

5248
01:31:14,470 --> 01:31:14,480
you
 

5249
01:31:14,480 --> 01:31:16,709
you
i mean it just it's such an epic name

01:31:16,709 --> 01:31:16,719
i mean it just it's such an epic name
 

5251
01:31:16,719 --> 01:31:18,550
i mean it just it's such an epic name
but the the reason why it's called that

5252
01:31:18,550 --> 01:31:18,560
but the the reason why it's called that
 

5253
01:31:18,560 --> 01:31:20,950
but the the reason why it's called that
is way less than epic it's it was it was

5254
01:31:20,950 --> 01:31:20,960
is way less than epic it's it was it was
 

5255
01:31:20,960 --> 01:31:23,990
is way less than epic it's it was it was
because it the the conference um which

at oxford university
 

5291
01:31:56,159 --> 01:31:58,470
at oxford university
and i mean i jumped at the chance

5292
01:31:58,470 --> 01:31:58,480
and i mean i jumped at the chance
 

5293
01:31:58,480 --> 01:32:00,390
and i mean i jumped at the chance
uh because i knew that martin and

5294
01:32:00,390 --> 01:32:00,400
uh because i knew that martin and
 

5295

uh because i knew that martin and
sinatra were both smarter than me and uh

5296

it would be fun to like talk about what
 

5299
01:32:04,560 --> 01:32:07,110
it would be fun to like talk about what
uh what the right strategy would be

5300
01:32:07,110 --> 01:32:07,120
uh what the right strategy would be
 

5301
01:32:07,120 --> 01:32:09,270
uh what the right strategy would be
on the drive in i didn't know what the

5302
01:32:09,270 --> 01:32:09,280
on the drive in i didn't know what the
 

5303
01:32:09,280 --> 01:32:12,229
on the drive in i didn't know what the
name of the town was and i asked as they

5304
01:32:12,229 --> 01:32:12,239
name of the town was and i asked as they
 

5305
01:32:12,239 --> 01:32:13,910
name of the town was and i asked as they

01:32:19,669 --> 01:32:19,679
and we were writing an op-ed about some
 

5313
01:32:19,679 --> 01:32:20,950
and we were writing an op-ed about some
of the ideas i hope we get to talk about

5314
01:32:20,950 --> 01:32:20,960
of the ideas i hope we get to talk about
 

5315
01:32:20,960 --> 01:32:23,990
of the ideas i hope we get to talk about
very soon um about focus protection and

5316
01:32:23,990 --> 01:32:24,000
very soon um about focus protection and
 

5317
01:32:24,000 --> 01:32:26,709
very soon um about focus protection and
the right strategy and uh when sinetra

5318
01:32:26,709 --> 01:32:26,719
the right strategy and uh when sinetra
 

5319
01:32:26,719 --> 01:32:28,870
the right strategy and uh when sinetra
arrived we realized we actually come

5320
01:32:28,870 --> 01:32:28,880
arrived we realized we actually come
 

5321
01:32:28,880 --> 01:32:30,390
arrived we realized we actually come
basically to the same place about the

5322
01:32:30,390 --> 01:32:30,400
basically to the same place about the
 

5323
01:32:30,400 --> 01:32:31,270
basically to the same place about the
right

5324
01:32:31,270 --> 01:32:31,280
right
 

5325
01:32:31,280 --> 01:32:33,750
right
way to deal with the epidemic

5326
01:32:33,750 --> 01:32:33,760
way to deal with the epidemic
 

5327
01:32:33,760 --> 01:32:36,229
way to deal with the epidemic
um and i i thought well why don't we put

5328
01:32:36,229 --> 01:32:36,239
um and i i thought well why don't we put
 

5329
01:32:36,239 --> 01:32:37,990
um and i i thought well why don't we put
issue why don't we write something like

5330
01:32:37,990 --> 01:32:38,000
issue why don't we write something like
 

5331
01:32:38,000 --> 01:32:39,669
issue why don't we write something like
the port hearing statement that was what

5332
01:32:39,669 --> 01:32:39,679
the port hearing statement that was what
 

5333
01:32:39,679 --> 01:32:41,350
the port hearing statement that was what
i had that in the back of my head yes

5334
01:32:41,350 --> 01:32:41,360
i had that in the back of my head yes
 

5335
01:32:41,360 --> 01:32:42,870
i had that in the back of my head yes
and i'm like well what's the name of

5336
01:32:42,870 --> 01:32:42,880
and i'm like well what's the name of
 

5337
01:32:42,880 --> 01:32:44,629
and i'm like well what's the name of
this town again it was great barrington

5338
01:32:44,629 --> 01:32:44,639
this town again it was great barrington
 

5339
01:32:44,639 --> 01:32:46,709
this town again it was great barrington
yeah so it's not barrington

5340
01:32:46,709 --> 01:32:46,719
yeah so it's not barrington
 

5341
01:32:46,719 --> 01:32:48,950
yeah so it's not barrington
it's great bear it's which is fantastic

5342
01:32:48,950 --> 01:32:48,960
it's great bear it's which is fantastic
 

5343
01:32:48,960 --> 01:32:49,990
it's great bear it's which is fantastic
right

5344
01:32:49,990 --> 01:32:50,000
right
 

5345
01:32:50,000 --> 01:32:52,709
right
it's so over the top that it's perfect

5346
01:32:52,709 --> 01:32:52,719
it's so over the top that it's perfect
 

5347
01:32:52,719 --> 01:32:53,750
it's so over the top that it's perfect
it's it's

5348
01:32:53,750 --> 01:32:53,760
it's it's
 

5349
01:32:53,760 --> 01:32:55,669
it's it's
literally like the big bang

5350
01:32:55,669 --> 01:32:55,679
literally like the big bang
 

5351
01:32:55,679 --> 01:32:56,709
literally like the big bang
there's something about these

5352
01:32:56,709 --> 01:32:56,719
there's something about these
 

5353
01:32:56,719 --> 01:32:59,030
there's something about these
over-the-top fun titles that just really

5354
01:32:59,030 --> 01:32:59,040
over-the-top fun titles that just really
 

5355
01:32:59,040 --> 01:33:00,470
over-the-top fun titles that just really
deliver them

5356
01:33:00,470 --> 01:33:00,480
deliver them
 

5357
01:33:00,480 --> 01:33:01,750
deliver them
so that's why that's my my main

5358
01:33:01,750 --> 01:33:01,760
so that's why that's my my main
 

5359
01:33:01,760 --> 01:33:03,590
so that's why that's my my main
contribution was the word is the title

5360
01:33:03,590 --> 01:33:03,600
contribution was the word is the title
 

5361
01:33:03,600 --> 01:33:05,910
contribution was the word is the title
the name great barrington decor um but

5362
01:33:05,910 --> 01:33:05,920
the name great barrington decor um but
 

5363
01:33:05,920 --> 01:33:07,750
the name great barrington decor um but
yeah so it was it was kind of uh so the

5364
01:33:07,750 --> 01:33:07,760
yeah so it was it was kind of uh so the
 

5365
01:33:07,760 --> 01:33:10,070
yeah so it was it was kind of uh so the
and the the idea is actually

5366
01:33:10,070 --> 01:33:10,080
and the the idea is actually
 

5367
01:33:10,080 --> 01:33:12,229
and the the idea is actually
while the title is great um and i think

5368
01:33:12,229 --> 01:33:12,239
while the title is great um and i think
 

5369
01:33:12,239 --> 01:33:13,590
while the title is great um and i think
that it was written in a very stylish

5370
01:33:13,590 --> 01:33:13,600
that it was written in a very stylish
 

5371
01:33:13,600 --> 01:33:14,390
that it was written in a very stylish
way

5372
01:33:14,390 --> 01:33:14,400
way
 

5373
01:33:14,400 --> 01:33:16,229
way
um it's you know like it's a go it's

5374
01:33:16,229 --> 01:33:16,239
um it's you know like it's a go it's
 

5375
01:33:16,239 --> 01:33:18,149
um it's you know like it's a go it's
less than a page you can go look online

5376
01:33:18,149 --> 01:33:18,159
less than a page you can go look online
 

5377
01:33:18,159 --> 01:33:20,790
less than a page you can go look online
and read it it's written written for

5378
01:33:20,790 --> 01:33:20,800
and read it it's written written for
 

5379
01:33:20,800 --> 01:33:22,629
and read it it's written written for
not for scientists but for the general

5380
01:33:22,629 --> 01:33:22,639
not for scientists but for the general
 

5381
01:33:22,639 --> 01:33:24,149
not for scientists but for the general
public so people can understand the

5382
01:33:24,149 --> 01:33:24,159
public so people can understand the
 

5383
01:33:24,159 --> 01:33:26,790
public so people can understand the
ideas really simply

5384
01:33:26,790 --> 01:33:26,800
ideas really simply
 

5385
01:33:26,800 --> 01:33:29,030
ideas really simply
but it is not actually a radical set of

5386
01:33:29,030 --> 01:33:29,040
but it is not actually a radical set of
 

5387
01:33:29,040 --> 01:33:30,950
but it is not actually a radical set of
ideas it actually represents the old

5388
01:33:30,950 --> 01:33:30,960
ideas it actually represents the old
 

5389
01:33:30,960 --> 01:33:32,709
ideas it actually represents the old
pandemic plans

5390
01:33:32,709 --> 01:33:32,719
pandemic plans
 

5391
01:33:32,719 --> 01:33:35,110
pandemic plans
that we've used for century

5392
01:33:35,110 --> 01:33:35,120
that we've used for century
 

5393
01:33:35,120 --> 01:33:38,229
that we've used for century
dealing with other similar pandemics

5394
01:33:38,229 --> 01:33:38,239
dealing with other similar pandemics
 

5395
01:33:38,239 --> 01:33:41,430
dealing with other similar pandemics
um and and there's it's twofold uh first

5396
01:33:41,430 --> 01:33:41,440
um and and there's it's twofold uh first
 

5397
01:33:41,440 --> 01:33:43,110
um and and there's it's twofold uh first
let me talk about the science it rests

5398
01:33:43,110 --> 01:33:43,120
let me talk about the science it rests
 

5399
01:33:43,120 --> 01:33:44,870
let me talk about the science it rests
on and then i'll talk about the plan

5400
01:33:44,870 --> 01:33:44,880
on and then i'll talk about the plan
 

5401
01:33:44,880 --> 01:33:46,149
on and then i'll talk about the plan
the science actually some of what we

5402
01:33:46,149 --> 01:33:46,159
the science actually some of what we
 

5403
01:33:46,159 --> 01:33:48,149
the science actually some of what we
already talked about uh there's this

5404
01:33:48,149 --> 01:33:48,159
already talked about uh there's this
 

5405
01:33:48,159 --> 01:33:50,870
already talked about uh there's this
massive age gradient in the risk of

5406
01:33:50,870 --> 01:33:50,880
massive age gradient in the risk of
 

5407
01:33:50,880 --> 01:33:52,870
massive age gradient in the risk of
coven infection older people face much

5408
01:33:52,870 --> 01:33:52,880
coven infection older people face much
 

5409
01:33:52,880 --> 01:33:55,590
coven infection older people face much
higher risk than younger people

5410
01:33:55,590 --> 01:33:55,600
higher risk than younger people
 

5411
01:33:55,600 --> 01:33:57,510
higher risk than younger people
the second bit of science is all that's

5412
01:33:57,510 --> 01:33:57,520
the second bit of science is all that's
 

5413
01:33:57,520 --> 01:33:59,110
the second bit of science is all that's
not controversial right that even if you

5414
01:33:59,110 --> 01:33:59,120
not controversial right that even if you
 

5415
01:33:59,120 --> 01:34:01,990
not controversial right that even if you
think the ifr is 0.7 or or or 0.2 no

5416
01:34:01,990 --> 01:34:02,000
think the ifr is 0.7 or or or 0.2 no
 

5417
01:34:02,000 --> 01:34:03,669
think the ifr is 0.7 or or or 0.2 no
matter what everyone thinks everyone

5418
01:34:03,669 --> 01:34:03,679
matter what everyone thinks everyone
 

5419
01:34:03,679 --> 01:34:06,550
matter what everyone thinks everyone
agrees on this age gradient

5420
01:34:06,550 --> 01:34:06,560
agrees on this age gradient
 

5421
01:34:06,560 --> 01:34:08,070
agrees on this age gradient
the second bit of science is also not

5422
01:34:08,070 --> 01:34:08,080
the second bit of science is also not
 

5423
01:34:08,080 --> 01:34:10,229
the second bit of science is also not
controversial

5424
01:34:10,229 --> 01:34:10,239
controversial
 

5425
01:34:10,239 --> 01:34:12,310
controversial
the lockdown focused policies that we

let me just give you some examples uh

5434
01:34:21,990 --> 01:34:22,000
let me just give you some examples uh
 

5435
01:34:22,000 --> 01:34:23,510
let me just give you some examples uh
and this is this was known in october of

5436
01:34:23,510 --> 01:34:23,520
and this is this was known in october of
 

5437
01:34:23,520 --> 01:34:26,550
and this is this was known in october of
2020 we wrote it right so um the un was

5438
01:34:26,550 --> 01:34:26,560
2020 we wrote it right so um the un was
 

5439
01:34:26,560 --> 01:34:29,590
2020 we wrote it right so um the un was
sounding alarms that there would be

5440
01:34:29,590 --> 01:34:29,600
sounding alarms that there would be
 

5441
01:34:29,600 --> 01:34:32,229
sounding alarms that there would be
tens of millions of people who would

tens of millions of people who would
 

5443

dpt diphtheria so on pertussis tetanus
 

5479
01:35:09,280 --> 01:35:11,990
dpt diphtheria so on pertussis tetanus
all those standard vaccination campaigns

5480
01:35:11,990 --> 01:35:12,000
all those standard vaccination campaigns
 

5481
01:35:12,000 --> 01:35:13,189
all those standard vaccination campaigns
stopped

5482
01:35:13,189 --> 01:35:13,199
stopped
 

5483
01:35:13,199 --> 01:35:15,350
stopped
tens of millions of children skipping

5484
01:35:15,350 --> 01:35:15,360
tens of millions of children skipping
 

5485
01:35:15,360 --> 01:35:16,790
tens of millions of children skipping
these doses

5486
01:35:16,790 --> 01:35:16,800
these doses
 

5487
01:35:16,800 --> 01:35:18,790
these doses
for diseases that are actually deadly

5488
01:35:18,790 --> 01:35:18,800
for diseases that are actually deadly
 

5489
01:35:18,800 --> 01:35:20,390
for diseases that are actually deadly
for them

5490
01:35:20,390 --> 01:35:20,400
for them
 

5491
01:35:20,400 --> 01:35:23,430
for them
is there just a on a small tangent

5492
01:35:23,430 --> 01:35:23,440
is there just a on a small tangent
 

5493
01:35:23,440 --> 01:35:25,910
is there just a on a small tangent
is it well understood to you what are

5494
01:35:25,910 --> 01:35:25,920
is it well understood to you what are
 

5495
01:35:25,920 --> 01:35:27,669
is it well understood to you what are
the mechanisms that stop all those

5496
01:35:27,669 --> 01:35:27,679
the mechanisms that stop all those
 

5497
01:35:27,679 --> 01:35:29,669
the mechanisms that stop all those
things because of lockdowns is it some

5498
01:35:29,669 --> 01:35:29,679
things because of lockdowns is it some
 

5499
01:35:29,679 --> 01:35:31,750
things because of lockdowns is it some
aspect of supply chain is it just

5500
01:35:31,750 --> 01:35:31,760
aspect of supply chain is it just
 

5501
01:35:31,760 --> 01:35:33,109
aspect of supply chain is it just
literally because

5502
01:35:33,109 --> 01:35:33,119
literally because
 

5503
01:35:33,119 --> 01:35:35,030
literally because
hospital doors are closed

5504
01:35:35,030 --> 01:35:35,040
hospital doors are closed
 

5505
01:35:35,040 --> 01:35:37,510
hospital doors are closed
is it because there's a disincentive to

5506
01:35:37,510 --> 01:35:37,520
is it because there's a disincentive to
 

5507
01:35:37,520 --> 01:35:39,590
is it because there's a disincentive to
go outside by people even when they

5508
01:35:39,590 --> 01:35:39,600
go outside by people even when they
 

5509
01:35:39,600 --> 01:35:42,229
go outside by people even when they
deeply need help it's all of the above

5510
01:35:42,229 --> 01:35:42,239
deeply need help it's all of the above
 

5511
01:35:42,239 --> 01:35:44,310
deeply need help it's all of the above
uh but a lot of those efforts especially

5512
01:35:44,310 --> 01:35:44,320
uh but a lot of those efforts especially
 

5513
01:35:44,320 --> 01:35:45,430
uh but a lot of those efforts especially
especially those like vaccination

5514
01:35:45,430 --> 01:35:45,440
especially those like vaccination
 

5515
01:35:45,440 --> 01:35:48,709
especially those like vaccination
efforts are funded and run by what

5516
01:35:48,709 --> 01:35:48,719
efforts are funded and run by what
 

5517
01:35:48,719 --> 01:35:51,270
efforts are funded and run by what
western efforts like gavi is a

5518
01:35:51,270 --> 01:35:51,280
western efforts like gavi is a
 

5519
01:35:51,280 --> 01:35:52,550
western efforts like gavi is a
i think it's a gates funded thing

5520
01:35:52,550 --> 01:35:52,560
i think it's a gates funded thing
 

5521
01:35:52,560 --> 01:35:55,109
i think it's a gates funded thing
actually that produce provides vaccines

5522
01:35:55,109 --> 01:35:55,119
actually that produce provides vaccines
 

5523
01:35:55,119 --> 01:35:58,070
actually that produce provides vaccines
for you know millions of kids worldwide

5524
01:35:58,070 --> 01:35:58,080
for you know millions of kids worldwide
 

5525
01:35:58,080 --> 01:36:01,109
for you know millions of kids worldwide
and those efforts were scaled back

5526
01:36:01,109 --> 01:36:01,119
and those efforts were scaled back
 

5527
01:36:01,119 --> 01:36:03,430
and those efforts were scaled back
malaria prevention efforts so in the

5528
01:36:03,430 --> 01:36:03,440
malaria prevention efforts so in the
 

5529
01:36:03,440 --> 01:36:05,990
malaria prevention efforts so in the
developing world it was a devastating

5530
01:36:05,990 --> 01:36:06,000
developing world it was a devastating

5571
01:36:51,600 --> 01:36:52,790
what what it's it's actually it's kind
of like what's happened to the west as

5572
01:36:52,790 --> 01:36:52,800
of like what's happened to the west as
 

5573
01:36:52,800 --> 01:36:55,750
of like what's happened to the west as
well but it was so severe uh there was a

5574
01:36:55,750 --> 01:36:55,760
well but it was so severe uh there was a
 

5575
01:36:55,760 --> 01:36:58,550
well but it was so severe uh there was a
zero prevalence study done in mumbai by

5576
01:36:58,550 --> 01:36:58,560
zero prevalence study done in mumbai by
 

5577
01:36:58,560 --> 01:36:59,590
zero prevalence study done in mumbai by
a friend of mine at the university of

5578
01:36:59,590 --> 01:36:59,600
a friend of mine at the university of
 

5579
01:36:59,600 --> 01:37:01,590
a friend of mine at the university of
chicago what he found was that in the

5580
01:37:01,590 --> 01:37:01,600
chicago what he found was that in the
 

5581
01:37:01,600 --> 01:37:03,430
chicago what he found was that in the
slums of mumbai

5582
01:37:03,430 --> 01:37:03,440
slums of mumbai
 

5583
01:37:03,440 --> 01:37:05,750
slums of mumbai
there were 70 surah prevalence in july

5584
01:37:05,750 --> 01:37:05,760
there were 70 surah prevalence in july
 

5585
01:37:05,760 --> 01:37:08,550
there were 70 surah prevalence in july
or august of seven of sept of 2020

5586
01:37:08,550 --> 01:37:08,560
or august of seven of sept of 2020
 

5587
01:37:08,560 --> 01:37:11,270
or august of seven of sept of 2020
whereas in the rest of mumbai is 20

5588
01:37:11,270 --> 01:37:11,280
whereas in the rest of mumbai is 20
 

5589
01:37:11,280 --> 01:37:13,510
whereas in the rest of mumbai is 20
yeah right so it was incredibly unequal

5590
01:37:13,510 --> 01:37:13,520
yeah right so it was incredibly unequal
 

5591
01:37:13,520 --> 01:37:16,229
yeah right so it was incredibly unequal
the the lockdowns protected the the

5592
01:37:16,229 --> 01:37:16,239
the the lockdowns protected the the
 

5593
01:37:16,239 --> 01:37:18,470
the the lockdowns protected the the
relatively well off and spread the

5594
01:37:18,470 --> 01:37:18,480
relatively well off and spread the
 

5595
01:37:18,480 --> 01:37:19,510
relatively well off and spread the
disease

5596
01:37:19,510 --> 01:37:19,520
disease
 

5597
01:37:19,520 --> 01:37:21,750
disease
among the poor

5598
01:37:21,750 --> 01:37:21,760
among the poor
 

5599
01:37:21,760 --> 01:37:25,350
among the poor
um so uh that's in the developing world

5600
01:37:25,350 --> 01:37:25,360
um so uh that's in the developing world
 

5601
01:37:25,360 --> 01:37:26,470
um so uh that's in the developing world
in the developed world the health

5602
01:37:26,470 --> 01:37:26,480
in the developed world the health
 

5603
01:37:26,480 --> 01:37:28,870
in the developed world the health
effects of lockdowns were

5604
01:37:28,870 --> 01:37:28,880
effects of lockdowns were
 

5605
01:37:28,880 --> 01:37:30,709
effects of lockdowns were
also quite bad

5606
01:37:30,709 --> 01:37:30,719
also quite bad
 

5607
01:37:30,719 --> 01:37:32,070
also quite bad
right so we talked already about

5608
01:37:32,070 --> 01:37:32,080
right so we talked already about
 

5609
01:37:32,080 --> 01:37:34,390
right so we talked already about
isolation and depression there was a

5610
01:37:34,390 --> 01:37:34,400
isolation and depression there was a
 

5611
01:37:34,400 --> 01:37:37,510
isolation and depression there was a
study done in july of 2020

5612
01:37:37,510 --> 01:37:37,520
study done in july of 2020
 

5613
01:37:37,520 --> 01:37:41,189
study done in july of 2020
that found that one in four young adults

5614
01:37:41,189 --> 01:37:41,199
that found that one in four young adults
 

5615
01:37:41,199 --> 01:37:43,189
that found that one in four young adults
seriously considered suicide

seriously considered suicide
 

5617
01:37:43,199 --> 01:37:46,870
seriously considered suicide
now suicide rates haven't like spiked up

5618
01:37:46,870 --> 01:37:46,880
now suicide rates haven't like spiked up
 

5619
01:37:46,880 --> 01:37:49,830
now suicide rates haven't like spiked up
so much but the depths of despair that

5620
01:37:49,830 --> 01:37:49,840
so much but the depths of despair that
 

5621
01:37:49,840 --> 01:37:51,910
so much but the depths of despair that
would lead somebody to seriously

5622
01:37:51,910 --> 01:37:51,920
would lead somebody to seriously
 

5623
01:37:51,920 --> 01:37:54,149
would lead somebody to seriously
consider suicide itself should be should

5624
01:37:54,149 --> 01:37:54,159
consider suicide itself should be should
 

5625
01:37:54,159 --> 01:37:56,390
consider suicide itself should be should
be a source of great concern for in

5626
01:37:56,390 --> 01:37:56,400
be a source of great concern for in
 

5627
01:37:56,400 --> 01:37:57,669
be a source of great concern for in
public health

5628
01:37:57,669 --> 01:37:57,679
public health
 

5629
01:37:57,679 --> 01:37:59,990
public health
yeah this is one of the troubling things

5630
01:37:59,990 --> 01:38:00,000
yeah this is one of the troubling things
 

5631
01:38:00,000 --> 01:38:03,030
yeah this is one of the troubling things
about measuring well-being is

5632
01:38:03,030 --> 01:38:03,040
about measuring well-being is
 

5633
01:38:03,040 --> 01:38:04,870
about measuring well-being is
we're okay at measuring death and

5634
01:38:04,870 --> 01:38:04,880
we're okay at measuring death and
 

5635
01:38:04,880 --> 01:38:06,070
we're okay at measuring death and
suicide

5636
01:38:06,070 --> 01:38:06,080
suicide
 

5637
01:38:06,080 --> 01:38:08,790
suicide
we're not so good at measuring suffering

5638
01:38:08,790 --> 01:38:08,800
we're not so good at measuring suffering
 

5639
01:38:08,800 --> 01:38:11,430
we're not so good at measuring suffering
it's like people talk about

5640
01:38:11,430 --> 01:38:11,440
it's like people talk about
 

5641
01:38:11,440 --> 01:38:13,270
it's like people talk about
um maybe even

5642
01:38:13,270 --> 01:38:13,280
um maybe even
 

5643
01:38:13,280 --> 01:38:16,950
um maybe even
harder more in the under stalin or the

5644
01:38:16,950 --> 01:38:16,960
harder more in the under stalin or the
 

5645
01:38:16,960 --> 01:38:19,750
harder more in the under stalin or the
concentration camps with hitler we talk

5646
01:38:19,750 --> 01:38:19,760
concentration camps with hitler we talk
 

5647
01:38:19,760 --> 01:38:21,189
concentration camps with hitler we talk
about deaths

5648
01:38:21,189 --> 01:38:21,199
about deaths
 

5649
01:38:21,199 --> 01:38:22,870
about deaths
but we don't talk about

5650
01:38:22,870 --> 01:38:22,880
but we don't talk about
 

5651
01:38:22,880 --> 01:38:26,070
but we don't talk about
the suffering over periods of years

5652
01:38:26,070 --> 01:38:26,080
the suffering over periods of years
 

5653
01:38:26,080 --> 01:38:28,149
the suffering over periods of years
by people living in fear by people

5654
01:38:28,149 --> 01:38:28,159
by people living in fear by people
 

5655
01:38:28,159 --> 01:38:29,350
by people living in fear by people
starving

5656
01:38:29,350 --> 01:38:29,360
starving
 

5657
01:38:29,360 --> 01:38:31,669
starving
psychological trauma that lasts a

5658
01:38:31,669 --> 01:38:31,679
psychological trauma that lasts a
 

5659
01:38:31,679 --> 01:38:33,830
psychological trauma that lasts a
lifetime all of those things

5660
01:38:33,830 --> 01:38:33,840
lifetime all of those things
 

5661
01:38:33,840 --> 01:38:35,590
lifetime all of those things
i mean and just to get back to that that

5662
01:38:35,590 --> 01:38:35,600
i mean and just to get back to that that
 

5663
01:38:35,600 --> 01:38:37,910
i mean and just to get back to that that
point we close schools especially in

5664
01:38:37,910 --> 01:38:37,920
point we close schools especially in
 

5665
01:38:37,920 --> 01:38:39,990
point we close schools especially in
blue states we close schools

5666
01:38:39,990 --> 01:38:40,000
blue states we close schools
 

5667
01:38:40,000 --> 01:38:42,149
blue states we close schools
now richer parents could send their kids

5668
01:38:42,149 --> 01:38:42,159
now richer parents could send their kids
 

5669
01:38:42,159 --> 01:38:43,669
now richer parents could send their kids
to private schools many of which stayed

5670
01:38:43,669 --> 01:38:43,679
to private schools many of which stayed
 

5671
01:38:43,679 --> 01:38:45,189
to private schools many of which stayed
open even in the blue states they could

5672
01:38:45,189 --> 01:38:45,199
open even in the blue states they could
 

5673
01:38:45,199 --> 01:38:47,270
open even in the blue states they could
get pods they could get tutors but

5674
01:38:47,270 --> 01:38:47,280
get pods they could get tutors but
 

5675
01:38:47,280 --> 01:38:49,350
get pods they could get tutors but
that's not true for for poorer and

5676
01:38:49,350 --> 01:38:49,360
that's not true for for poorer and
 

5677
01:38:49,360 --> 01:38:51,669
that's not true for for poorer and
middle class parents

5678
01:38:51,669 --> 01:38:51,679
middle class parents
 

5679
01:38:51,679 --> 01:38:54,149
middle class parents
and as a result what we did is we took

5680
01:38:54,149 --> 01:38:54,159
and as a result what we did is we took
 

5681
01:38:54,159 --> 01:38:56,070
and as a result what we did is we took
away life opportunities for kids we we

5682
01:38:56,070 --> 01:38:56,080
away life opportunities for kids we we
 

5683
01:38:56,080 --> 01:38:57,590
away life opportunities for kids we we
tried to teach

5684
01:38:57,590 --> 01:38:57,600
tried to teach
 

5685
01:38:57,600 --> 01:38:59,430
tried to teach
five-year-olds to read via zoom in

5686
01:38:59,430 --> 01:38:59,440
five-year-olds to read via zoom in
 

5687
01:38:59,440 --> 01:39:01,189
five-year-olds to read via zoom in
kindergarten

5688
01:39:01,189 --> 01:39:01,199
kindergarten
 

5689
01:39:01,199 --> 01:39:02,709
kindergarten
right uh

5690
01:39:02,709 --> 01:39:02,719
right uh
 

5691
01:39:02,719 --> 01:39:04,709
right uh
and uh the consequence actually you

5692
01:39:04,709 --> 01:39:04,719
and uh the consequence actually you
 

5693
01:39:04,719 --> 01:39:06,229
and uh the consequence actually you
think okay we can just make it up but

5694
01:39:06,229 --> 01:39:06,239
think okay we can just make it up but
 

5695
01:39:06,239 --> 01:39:08,950
think okay we can just make it up but
it's really difficult to make that up

5696
01:39:08,950 --> 01:39:08,960
it's really difficult to make that up
 

5697
01:39:08,960 --> 01:39:11,669
it's really difficult to make that up
there's a literature in health economics

5698
01:39:11,669 --> 01:39:11,679
there's a literature in health economics
 

5699
01:39:11,679 --> 01:39:13,910
there's a literature in health economics
that shows that even uh

5700
01:39:13,910 --> 01:39:13,920
that shows that even uh
 

5701
01:39:13,920 --> 01:39:14,790
that shows that even uh
you know

5702
01:39:14,790 --> 01:39:14,800
you know
 

5703
01:39:14,800 --> 01:39:17,430
you know
relatively small disruptions in

5704
01:39:17,430 --> 01:39:17,440
relatively small disruptions in
 

5705
01:39:17,440 --> 01:39:20,149
relatively small disruptions in
schooling can have lifelong consequences

5706
01:39:20,149 --> 01:39:20,159
schooling can have lifelong consequences
 

5707
01:39:20,159 --> 01:39:22,149
schooling can have lifelong consequences
negative consequences for kids

5708
01:39:22,149 --> 01:39:22,159
negative consequences for kids
 

5709
01:39:22,159 --> 01:39:25,350
negative consequences for kids
right so they end up growing up poorer

5710
01:39:25,350 --> 01:39:25,360
right so they end up growing up poorer
 

5711
01:39:25,360 --> 01:39:27,430
right so they end up growing up poorer
they they lead shorter lives and less

5712
01:39:27,430 --> 01:39:27,440
they they lead shorter lives and less
 

5713
01:39:27,440 --> 01:39:28,709
they they lead shorter lives and less
healthy lives

5714
01:39:28,709 --> 01:39:28,719
healthy lives
 

5715
01:39:28,719 --> 01:39:30,390
healthy lives
as a consequence that's and that's what

5716
01:39:30,390 --> 01:39:30,400
as a consequence that's and that's what
 

5717
01:39:30,400 --> 01:39:32,229
as a consequence that's and that's what
the literature now shows is likely to

5718
01:39:32,229 --> 01:39:32,239
the literature now shows is likely to
 

5719
01:39:32,239 --> 01:39:34,470
the literature now shows is likely to
happen with the interruptions of

happen with the interruptions of
 

5721
01:39:34,480 --> 01:39:36,070

um and if we can talk about the

um and if we can talk about the
 

5747
01:39:58,320 --> 01:39:59,830
um and if we can talk about the
scientific basis of that if you'd like

scientific basis of that if you'd like
 

5749
01:39:59,840 --> 01:40:02,070
scientific basis of that if you'd like
but that was pretty well known even in

men and women skipped colon cancer
 

5773
01:40:21,199 --> 01:40:23,510
men and women skipped colon cancer
screening again with later stage disease

with diabetes
 

5781
01:40:28,880 --> 01:40:30,390
with diabetes
it's very important to have regular

5782
01:40:30,390 --> 01:40:30,400
it's very important to have regular
 

5783
01:40:30,400 --> 01:40:33,109
it's very important to have regular
screening for blood sugar levels

5784
01:40:33,109 --> 01:40:33,119
screening for blood sugar levels
 

5785
01:40:33,119 --> 01:40:35,750
screening for blood sugar levels
and and sort of counseling for lifestyle

5786
01:40:35,750 --> 01:40:35,760
and and sort of counseling for lifestyle
 

5787
01:40:35,760 --> 01:40:38,070
and and sort of counseling for lifestyle
improvement and we skipped that

5788
01:40:38,070 --> 01:40:38,080
improvement and we skipped that
 

5789
01:40:38,080 --> 01:40:39,590
improvement and we skipped that
people stayed home with heart attacks

5790
01:40:39,590 --> 01:40:39,600
people stayed home with heart attacks
 

5791
01:40:39,600 --> 01:40:43,270
people stayed home with heart attacks
and died at home with heart attacks

5792
01:40:43,270 --> 01:40:43,280
and died at home with heart attacks
 

5793
01:40:43,280 --> 01:40:45,590
and died at home with heart attacks
so you had this like sort of wide range

5794
01:40:45,590 --> 01:40:45,600
so you had this like sort of wide range
 

5795
01:40:45,600 --> 01:40:47,270
so you had this like sort of wide range
of medical

5796
01:40:47,270 --> 01:40:47,280
of medical
 

5797
01:40:47,280 --> 01:40:49,590
of medical
and psychological harms

5798
01:40:49,590 --> 01:40:49,600
and psychological harms
 

5799
01:40:49,600 --> 01:40:51,750
and psychological harms
that were being utterly ignored

5800
01:40:51,750 --> 01:40:51,760
that were being utterly ignored
 

5801
01:40:51,760 --> 01:40:53,830
that were being utterly ignored
as a result of the lockdowns

5802
01:40:53,830 --> 01:40:53,840
as a result of the lockdowns
 

5803
01:40:53,840 --> 01:40:57,189
as a result of the lockdowns
plus there's the economic pain

plus there's the economic pain
 

5805
01:40:57,199 --> 01:40:59,350
plus there's the economic pain
so like you said the

5806
01:40:59,350 --> 01:40:59,360
so like you said the
 

5807
01:40:59,360 --> 01:41:00,669
so like you said the
whatever is a good term for the

5808
01:41:00,669 --> 01:41:00,679
whatever is a good term for the
 

5809

whatever is a good term for the
non-laptop class

5810
01:41:03,189 --> 01:41:03,199

01:41:03,199 --> 01:41:05,430
non-laptop class
people would lose their jobs yes there

people would lose their jobs yes there
 

5813
01:41:05,440 --> 01:41:07,109
people would lose their jobs yes there
might be in the in the western world

5814
01:41:07,109 --> 01:41:07,119

gigantic detrimental effect it has on
society because

6118
01:46:30,629 --> 01:46:30,639
society because
 

6119
01:46:30,639 --> 01:46:32,310
society because
you're mostly

6120
01:46:32,310 --> 01:46:32,320
you're mostly
 

6121
01:46:32,320 --> 01:46:33,910
you're mostly
fine

6122
01:46:33,910 --> 01:46:33,920
fine
 

6123
01:46:33,920 --> 01:46:36,629
fine
that i'm so terrified of that

6124
01:46:36,629 --> 01:46:36,639
that i'm so terrified of that
 

6125
01:46:36,639 --> 01:46:38,629
that i'm so terrified of that
well i think the answer to that is just

6126
01:46:38,629 --> 01:46:38,639
well i think the answer to that is just
 

6127
01:46:38,639 --> 01:46:39,590
well i think the answer to that is just
to

6128
01:46:39,590 --> 01:46:39,600
to
 

6129
01:46:39,600 --> 01:46:40,470
to
you remember

6130
01:46:40,470 --> 01:46:40,480
you remember
 

6131
01:46:40,480 --> 01:46:41,750
you remember
yeah yeah

6132
01:46:41,750 --> 01:46:41,760
yeah yeah
 

6133
01:46:41,760 --> 01:46:43,270
yeah yeah
i don't think um you know remember where

6134
01:46:43,270 --> 01:46:43,280
i don't think um you know remember where
 

6135
01:46:43,280 --> 01:46:45,109
i don't think um you know remember where
you came from remember who who who

6136
01:46:45,109 --> 01:46:45,119
you came from remember who who who
 

6137
01:46:45,119 --> 01:46:47,030
you came from remember who who who
you're doing is for at the back of your

6138
01:46:47,030 --> 01:46:47,040
you're doing is for at the back of your
 

6139
01:46:47,040 --> 01:46:48,709
you're doing is for at the back of your
head should always be what's what's the

6140
01:46:48,709 --> 01:46:48,719
head should always be what's what's the
 

6141
01:46:48,719 --> 01:46:50,950
head should always be what's what's the
purpose like why am i here what's the

6142
01:46:50,950 --> 01:46:50,960
purpose like why am i here what's the
 

6143
01:46:50,960 --> 01:46:53,030
purpose like why am i here what's the
purpose of this and if i'm if if the

6144
01:46:53,030 --> 01:46:53,040
purpose of this and if i'm if if the
 

6145
01:46:53,040 --> 01:46:55,390
purpose of this and if i'm if if the
purpose is simply

6146
01:46:55,390 --> 01:46:55,400
purpose is simply
 

6147
01:46:55,400 --> 01:46:57,109
purpose is simply
self-aggrandizement then you should

6148
01:46:57,109 --> 01:46:57,119
self-aggrandizement then you should
 

6149
01:46:57,119 --> 01:46:58,870
self-aggrandizement then you should
rethink because it'll just end up being

6150
01:46:58,870 --> 01:46:58,880
rethink because it'll just end up being
 

6151
01:46:58,880 --> 01:47:01,030
rethink because it'll just end up being
a hall of life

6152
01:47:01,030 --> 01:47:01,040
a hall of life
 

6153
01:47:01,040 --> 01:47:04,790
a hall of life
all of us will be forgotten in the end

6154
01:47:04,790 --> 01:47:04,800
all of us will be forgotten in the end
 

6155
01:47:04,800 --> 01:47:06,550
all of us will be forgotten in the end
focus protection

6156
01:47:06,550 --> 01:47:06,560
focus protection
 

6157
01:47:06,560 --> 01:47:09,030
focus protection
the idea the policy what is focus

6158
01:47:09,030 --> 01:47:09,040
the idea the policy what is focus
 

6159
01:47:09,040 --> 01:47:10,950
the idea the policy what is focus
protection right so those i was saying

6160
01:47:10,950 --> 01:47:10,960
protection right so those i was saying
 

6161
01:47:10,960 --> 01:47:13,030
protection right so those i was saying
that there's two scientific bases right

6162
01:47:13,030 --> 01:47:13,040
that there's two scientific bases right
 

6163
01:47:13,040 --> 01:47:15,030
that there's two scientific bases right
so one is this the steep age gradient

6164
01:47:15,030 --> 01:47:15,040
so one is this the steep age gradient
 

6165
01:47:15,040 --> 01:47:16,709
so one is this the steep age gradient
the second is the existence of locked

6166
01:47:16,709 --> 01:47:16,719
the second is the existence of locked
 

6167
01:47:16,719 --> 01:47:18,149
the second is the existence of locked
arms again i think there's not very

6168
01:47:18,149 --> 01:47:18,159
arms again i think there's not very
 

6169
01:47:18,159 --> 01:47:19,590
arms again i think there's not very
little disagreement in the scientific

6170
01:47:19,590 --> 01:47:19,600
little disagreement in the scientific
 

6171
01:47:19,600 --> 01:47:22,229
little disagreement in the scientific
community of both of those facts

6172
01:47:22,229 --> 01:47:22,239
community of both of those facts
 

6173
01:47:22,239 --> 01:47:24,550
community of both of those facts
if you put those facts together

6174
01:47:24,550 --> 01:47:24,560
if you put those facts together
 

6175
01:47:24,560 --> 01:47:27,350
if you put those facts together
the obvious policy is to protect the

6176
01:47:27,350 --> 01:47:27,360
the obvious policy is to protect the
 

6177
01:47:27,360 --> 01:47:29,430
the obvious policy is to protect the
people who are at the most severe risk

6178
01:47:29,430 --> 01:47:29,440
people who are at the most severe risk
 

6179
01:47:29,440 --> 01:47:31,510
people who are at the most severe risk
from the disease itself

6180
01:47:31,510 --> 01:47:31,520
from the disease itself
 

6181
01:47:31,520 --> 01:47:32,950
from the disease itself
and that's the idea of focus protection

6182
01:47:32,950 --> 01:47:32,960
and that's the idea of focus protection
 

6183
01:47:32,960 --> 01:47:35,109
and that's the idea of focus protection
that's the general principle of it

6184
01:47:35,109 --> 01:47:35,119
that's the general principle of it
 

6185
01:47:35,119 --> 01:47:37,830
that's the general principle of it
the actual implementation of it depends

6186
01:47:37,830 --> 01:47:37,840
the actual implementation of it depends
 

6187
01:47:37,840 --> 01:47:39,830
the actual implementation of it depends
on the living circumstances of the

6188
01:47:39,830 --> 01:47:39,840
on the living circumstances of the
 

6189
01:47:39,840 --> 01:47:41,510
on the living circumstances of the
people that are at risk

6190
01:47:41,510 --> 01:47:41,520
people that are at risk
 

6191
01:47:41,520 --> 01:47:42,950
people that are at risk
the resources are available in the

6192
01:47:42,950 --> 01:47:42,960
the resources are available in the
 

6193
01:47:42,960 --> 01:47:46,470
the resources are available in the
community uh the the uh the technology

6194
01:47:46,470 --> 01:47:46,480
community uh the the uh the technology
 

6195
01:47:46,480 --> 01:47:49,270
community uh the the uh the technology
is available to do this

6196
01:47:49,270 --> 01:47:49,280
is available to do this
 

6197
01:47:49,280 --> 01:47:51,830
is available to do this
and so it's almost always going to be in

6198
01:47:51,830 --> 01:47:51,840
and so it's almost always going to be in
 

6199
01:47:51,840 --> 01:47:54,709
and so it's almost always going to be in
fact it'll always be a local thing

6200
01:47:54,709 --> 01:47:54,719
fact it'll always be a local thing
 

6201
01:47:54,719 --> 01:47:57,189
fact it'll always be a local thing
because it'll depend on the the the all

6202
01:47:57,189 --> 01:47:57,199
because it'll depend on the the the all
 

6203
01:47:57,199 --> 01:47:58,629
because it'll depend on the the the all
of those those things which are all

6204
01:47:58,629 --> 01:47:58,639
of those those things which are all
 

6205
01:47:58,639 --> 01:48:00,149
of those those things which are all
local in nature

6206
01:48:00,149 --> 01:48:00,159
local in nature
 

6207
01:48:00,159 --> 01:48:03,350
local in nature
right so one very very obvious thing in

6208
01:48:03,350 --> 01:48:03,360
right so one very very obvious thing in
 

6209
01:48:03,360 --> 01:48:05,910
right so one very very obvious thing in
a country like ours where so many older

6210
01:48:05,910 --> 01:48:05,920
a country like ours where so many older
 

6211
01:48:05,920 --> 01:48:07,669
a country like ours where so many older
people live in institutionalized

6212
01:48:07,669 --> 01:48:07,679
people live in institutionalized
 

6213
01:48:07,679 --> 01:48:10,390
people live in institutionalized
settings in nursing home settings

6214
01:48:10,390 --> 01:48:10,400
settings in nursing home settings
 

6215
01:48:10,400 --> 01:48:12,950
settings in nursing home settings
and that's where older really vulnerable

6216
01:48:12,950 --> 01:48:12,960
and that's where older really vulnerable
 

6217
01:48:12,960 --> 01:48:15,669
and that's where older really vulnerable
chronically ill patients often live

6218
01:48:15,669 --> 01:48:15,679
chronically ill patients often live
 

6219
01:48:15,679 --> 01:48:17,669
chronically ill patients often live
it is and you know this disease affects

6220
01:48:17,669 --> 01:48:17,679
it is and you know this disease affects
 

6221
01:48:17,679 --> 01:48:19,750
it is and you know this disease affects
that group most like most most commonly

6222
01:48:19,750 --> 01:48:19,760
that group most like most most commonly
 

6223
01:48:19,760 --> 01:48:21,910
that group most like most most commonly
it is absolutely vital to protect that

6224
01:48:21,910 --> 01:48:21,920
it is absolutely vital to protect that
 

6225
01:48:21,920 --> 01:48:23,109
it is absolutely vital to protect that
group

6226
01:48:23,109 --> 01:48:23,119
group
 

6227
01:48:23,119 --> 01:48:25,669
group
um we should have known that in february

6228
01:48:25,669 --> 01:48:25,679
um we should have known that in february
 

6229
01:48:25,679 --> 01:48:30,149
um we should have known that in february
2020 from just from the chinese data

6230
01:48:30,149 --> 01:48:30,159

 

6231
01:48:30,159 --> 01:48:30,870

and

6232
01:48:30,870 --> 01:48:30,880
and
 

6233
01:48:30,880 --> 01:48:33,109
and
we should have thought about that group

6234
01:48:33,109 --> 01:48:33,119
we should have thought about that group
 

6235
01:48:33,119 --> 01:48:36,229
we should have thought about that group
as the as this as the key constraint

6236
01:48:36,229 --> 01:48:36,239
as the as this as the key constraint
 

6237
01:48:36,239 --> 01:48:38,229
as the as this as the key constraint
in our policy making

6238
01:48:38,229 --> 01:48:38,239
in our policy making
 

6239
01:48:38,239 --> 01:48:40,709
in our policy making
um instead we thought about in february

6240
01:48:40,709 --> 01:48:40,719
um instead we thought about in february
 

6241
01:48:40,719 --> 01:48:43,590
um instead we thought about in february
march 2020 as hospital beds as the key

6242
01:48:43,590 --> 01:48:43,600
march 2020 as hospital beds as the key
 

6243
01:48:43,600 --> 01:48:44,790
march 2020 as hospital beds as the key
constraint

6244
01:48:44,790 --> 01:48:44,800
constraint
 

6245
01:48:44,800 --> 01:48:46,790
constraint
hospital beds and ventilator shortages

6246
01:48:46,790 --> 01:48:46,800
hospital beds and ventilator shortages
 

6247
01:48:46,800 --> 01:48:49,030
hospital beds and ventilator shortages
and that we so we we ran around trying

6248
01:48:49,030 --> 01:48:49,040
and that we so we we ran around trying
 

6249
01:48:49,040 --> 01:48:51,109
and that we so we we ran around trying
to like address that

6250
01:48:51,109 --> 01:48:51,119
to like address that
 

6251
01:48:51,119 --> 01:48:52,790
to like address that
constraint you know like a linear

6252
01:48:52,790 --> 01:48:52,800
constraint you know like a linear
 

6253
01:48:52,800 --> 01:48:53,910
constraint you know like a linear
programming problem you figure out what

6254
01:48:53,910 --> 01:48:53,920
programming problem you figure out what
 

6255
01:48:53,920 --> 01:48:55,430
programming problem you figure out what
the which constraints binding and you

6256
01:48:55,430 --> 01:48:55,440
the which constraints binding and you
 

6257
01:48:55,440 --> 01:48:56,790
the which constraints binding and you
address that one thing and then you go

6258
01:48:56,790 --> 01:48:56,800
address that one thing and then you go
 

6259
01:48:56,800 --> 01:48:59,510
address that one thing and then you go
to the next one right um if that's it's

6260
01:48:59,510 --> 01:48:59,520
to the next one right um if that's it's
 

6261
01:48:59,520 --> 01:49:01,189
to the next one right um if that's it's
that one constraint we said okay the

6262
01:49:01,189 --> 01:49:01,199
that one constraint we said okay the
 

6263
01:49:01,199 --> 01:49:04,229
that one constraint we said okay the
constraint is hospital beds

6264
01:49:04,229 --> 01:49:04,239
constraint is hospital beds
 

6265
01:49:04,239 --> 01:49:07,109
constraint is hospital beds
that led to the decision in many of the

6266
01:49:07,109 --> 01:49:07,119
that led to the decision in many of the
 

6267
01:49:07,119 --> 01:49:09,590
that led to the decision in many of the
northeast states to send

6268
01:49:09,590 --> 01:49:09,600
northeast states to send
 

6269
01:49:09,600 --> 01:49:11,590
northeast states to send
covet infected patients who were on on

6270
01:49:11,590 --> 01:49:11,600
covet infected patients who were on on
 

6271
01:49:11,600 --> 01:49:13,109
covet infected patients who were on on
the verge of like it looked like they

6272
01:49:13,109 --> 01:49:13,119
the verge of like it looked like they
 

6273
01:49:13,119 --> 01:49:15,270
the verge of like it looked like they
were about to recover back to nursing

6274
01:49:15,270 --> 01:49:15,280
were about to recover back to nursing
 

6275
01:49:15,280 --> 01:49:17,189
were about to recover back to nursing
homes

6276
01:49:17,189 --> 01:49:17,199
homes
 

6277
01:49:17,199 --> 01:49:18,950
homes
who then spread the disease all through

6278
01:49:18,950 --> 01:49:18,960
who then spread the disease all through
 

6279
01:49:18,960 --> 01:49:20,070
who then spread the disease all through
there because they wanted to preserve

6280
01:49:20,070 --> 01:49:20,080
there because they wanted to preserve
 

6281
01:49:20,080 --> 01:49:21,750
there because they wanted to preserve
the hospital beds

6282
01:49:21,750 --> 01:49:21,760
the hospital beds
 

6283
01:49:21,760 --> 01:49:24,310
the hospital beds
well for somebody who loves the miracle

6284
01:49:24,310 --> 01:49:24,320
well for somebody who loves the miracle
 

6285
01:49:24,320 --> 01:49:26,070
well for somebody who loves the miracle
optimization i love the way you frame

6286
01:49:26,070 --> 01:49:26,080
optimization i love the way you frame
 

6287
01:49:26,080 --> 01:49:27,830
optimization i love the way you frame
this

6288
01:49:27,830 --> 01:49:27,840
this
 

6289
01:49:27,840 --> 01:49:30,390
this
but those are kind of connected right if

6290
01:49:30,390 --> 01:49:30,400
but those are kind of connected right if
 

6291
01:49:30,400 --> 01:49:32,550
but those are kind of connected right if
you actually focus on protecting the

6292
01:49:32,550 --> 01:49:32,560
you actually focus on protecting the
 

6293
01:49:32,560 --> 01:49:35,350
you actually focus on protecting the
vulnerable you will also

6294
01:49:35,350 --> 01:49:35,360
vulnerable you will also
 

6295
01:49:35,360 --> 01:49:37,430
vulnerable you will also
have the effect of

6296
01:49:37,430 --> 01:49:37,440
have the effect of
 

6297
01:49:37,440 --> 01:49:38,229
have the effect of
not

6298
01:49:38,229 --> 01:49:38,239
not
 

6299
01:49:38,239 --> 01:49:40,390
not
hitting the ceiling of the available

6300
01:49:40,390 --> 01:49:40,400
hitting the ceiling of the available
 

6301
01:49:40,400 --> 01:49:42,629
hitting the ceiling of the available
that is that's the irony if we protected

6302
01:49:42,629 --> 01:49:42,639
that is that's the irony if we protected
 

6303
01:49:42,639 --> 01:49:45,189
that is that's the irony if we protected
the vulnerable the vulnerable the most

6304
01:49:45,189 --> 01:49:45,199
the vulnerable the vulnerable the most
 

6305
01:49:45,199 --> 01:49:47,510
the vulnerable the vulnerable the most
likely to be hospitalized and so by

6306
01:49:47,510 --> 01:49:47,520
likely to be hospitalized and so by
 

6307
01:49:47,520 --> 01:49:49,270
likely to be hospitalized and so by
protecting the hospital about protecting

6308
01:49:49,270 --> 01:49:49,280
protecting the hospital about protecting
 

6309
01:49:49,280 --> 01:49:51,510
protecting the hospital about protecting
the vulnerable we would also have

6310
01:49:51,510 --> 01:49:51,520
the vulnerable we would also have
 

6311
01:49:51,520 --> 01:49:52,709
the vulnerable we would also have
addressed the shortage of hospital

6312
01:49:52,709 --> 01:49:52,719
addressed the shortage of hospital
 

6313
01:49:52,719 --> 01:49:54,550
addressed the shortage of hospital
that's more effectively so that little

6314
01:49:54,550 --> 01:49:54,560
that's more effectively so that little
 

6315
01:49:54,560 --> 01:49:56,550
that's more effectively so that little
shift in priority would have had a big

6316
01:49:56,550 --> 01:49:56,560
shift in priority would have had a big
 

6317
01:49:56,560 --> 01:49:57,589
shift in priority would have had a big
impact

6318
01:49:57,589 --> 01:49:57,599
impact
 

6319
01:49:57,599 --> 01:50:01,589
impact
okay but specifically the idea is to

6320
01:50:01,589 --> 01:50:01,599
okay but specifically the idea is to
 

6321
01:50:01,599 --> 01:50:03,510
okay but specifically the idea is to
and we could talk about different ideas

6322
01:50:03,510 --> 01:50:03,520
and we could talk about different ideas
 

6323
01:50:03,520 --> 01:50:05,669
and we could talk about different ideas
of how to actually do this but uh you

6324
01:50:05,669 --> 01:50:05,679
of how to actually do this but uh you
 

6325
01:50:05,679 --> 01:50:07,350
of how to actually do this but uh you
know you

6326
01:50:07,350 --> 01:50:07,360
know you
 

6327
01:50:07,360 --> 01:50:09,430
know you
basically do a lockdown or something

6328
01:50:09,430 --> 01:50:09,440
basically do a lockdown or something
 

6329
01:50:09,440 --> 01:50:12,390
basically do a lockdown or something
like that on a very small set i mean you

6330
01:50:12,390 --> 01:50:12,400
like that on a very small set i mean you
 

6331
01:50:12,400 --> 01:50:13,990
like that on a very small set i mean you
may have to do that if it's community

6332
01:50:13,990 --> 01:50:14,000
may have to do that if it's community
 

6333
01:50:14,000 --> 01:50:15,510
may have to do that if it's community
spread is very high but generally i

6334
01:50:15,510 --> 01:50:15,520
spread is very high but generally i
 

6335
01:50:15,520 --> 01:50:17,189
spread is very high but generally i
think

6336
01:50:17,189 --> 01:50:17,199
think
 

6337
01:50:17,199 --> 01:50:18,709
think
it would depend on again the living

6338
01:50:18,709 --> 01:50:18,719
it would depend on again the living
 

6339
01:50:18,719 --> 01:50:20,550
it would depend on again the living
circumstances and the uh so so for

6340
01:50:20,550 --> 01:50:20,560
circumstances and the uh so so for
 

6341
01:50:20,560 --> 01:50:22,229
circumstances and the uh so so for
instance um

6342
01:50:22,229 --> 01:50:22,239
instance um
 

6343
01:50:22,239 --> 01:50:24,629
instance um
if you are in a if you have a here's a

6344
01:50:24,629 --> 01:50:24,639
if you are in a if you have a here's a
 

6345
01:50:24,639 --> 01:50:25,990
if you are in a if you have a here's a
very simple idea that doesn't require a

6346
01:50:25,990 --> 01:50:26,000
very simple idea that doesn't require a
 

6347
01:50:26,000 --> 01:50:27,430
very simple idea that doesn't require a
lockdown

6348
01:50:27,430 --> 01:50:27,440
lockdown
 

6349
01:50:27,440 --> 01:50:28,870
lockdown
forced on them i i don't actually

6350
01:50:28,870 --> 01:50:28,880
forced on them i i don't actually
 

6351
01:50:28,880 --> 01:50:30,229
forced on them i i don't actually
generally are not in favor of that kind

6352
01:50:30,229 --> 01:50:30,239
generally are not in favor of that kind
 

6353
01:50:30,239 --> 01:50:31,510
generally are not in favor of that kind
of force lockdown because you just won't

6354
01:50:31,510 --> 01:50:31,520
of force lockdown because you just won't
 

6355
01:50:31,520 --> 01:50:33,350
of force lockdown because you just won't
get cooperation

6356
01:50:33,350 --> 01:50:33,360
get cooperation
 

6357
01:50:33,360 --> 01:50:35,030
get cooperation
um but what you could do is provide

6358
01:50:35,030 --> 01:50:35,040
um but what you could do is provide
 

6359
01:50:35,040 --> 01:50:36,950
um but what you could do is provide
resources to

6360
01:50:36,950 --> 01:50:36,960
resources to
 

6361
01:50:36,960 --> 01:50:39,109
resources to
that group of people so like ima imagine

6362
01:50:39,109 --> 01:50:39,119
that group of people so like ima imagine
 

6363
01:50:39,119 --> 01:50:41,510
that group of people so like ima imagine
you live next door to somebody uh an

01:50:41,510 --> 01:50:41,520
you live next door to somebody uh an
 

6365
01:50:41,520 --> 01:50:43,189
you live next door to somebody uh an
older couple

6366
01:50:43,189 --> 01:50:43,199
older couple
 

6367
01:50:43,199 --> 01:50:44,950
older couple
um and it's there's high community

6368
01:50:44,950 --> 01:50:44,960
um and it's there's high community
 

6369
01:50:44,960 --> 01:50:46,229
um and it's there's high community
spread

6370
01:50:46,229 --> 01:50:46,239
spread
 

6371
01:50:46,239 --> 01:50:48,470
spread
well they have to go grocery shopping

6372
01:50:48,470 --> 01:50:48,480

01:50:50,080 --> 01:50:51,830
um we did like some of these some
communities did these like senior only

6376
01:50:51,830 --> 01:50:51,840
communities did these like senior only
 

6377
01:50:51,840 --> 01:50:54,149
communities did these like senior only
grocery hour right but but they have to

still have to go out and they might get
 

6381
01:50:55,679 --> 01:50:57,750
still have to go out and they might get
exposed in when they're shopping amongst

6382
01:50:57,750 --> 01:50:57,760
exposed in when they're shopping amongst
 

6383

exposed in when they're shopping amongst
other seniors yeah

laptop class

6390
01:51:05,669 --> 01:51:05,679
laptop class
 

6391
01:51:05,679 --> 01:51:07,669
laptop class
right uh or or you can even just there's

6392
01:51:07,669 --> 01:51:07,679
right uh or or you can even just there's
 

6393
01:51:07,679 --> 01:51:09,270
right uh or or you can even just there's
a volunteer effort you know the older

6394
01:51:09,270 --> 01:51:09,280
a volunteer effort you know the older
 

6395
01:51:09,280 --> 01:51:10,629
a volunteer effort you know the older
people living next door just call them

6396
01:51:10,629 --> 01:51:10,639
people living next door just call them
 

6397
01:51:10,639 --> 01:51:12,550
people living next door just call them
up and say can i help you get uh go out

6398
01:51:12,550 --> 01:51:12,560
up and say can i help you get uh go out
 

6399
01:51:12,560 --> 01:51:14,149
up and say can i help you get uh go out
and go shopping for it and so you would

6400
01:51:14,149 --> 01:51:14,159
and go shopping for it and so you would
 

6401
01:51:14,159 --> 01:51:15,589
and go shopping for it and so you would
have potentially

6402
01:51:15,589 --> 01:51:15,599
have potentially
 

6403
01:51:15,599 --> 01:51:17,510
have potentially
federal support of that kind of thing so

6404
01:51:17,510 --> 01:51:17,520
federal support of that kind of thing so
 

6405
01:51:17,520 --> 01:51:20,070
federal support of that kind of thing so
these kinds of efforts and identify

6406
01:51:20,070 --> 01:51:20,080
these kinds of efforts and identify
 

6407
01:51:20,080 --> 01:51:22,229
these kinds of efforts and identify
where the vulnerable people live uh it's

6408
01:51:22,229 --> 01:51:22,239
where the vulnerable people live uh it's
 

6409
01:51:22,239 --> 01:51:24,149
where the vulnerable people live uh it's
really challenging in multi-generational

6410
01:51:24,149 --> 01:51:24,159
really challenging in multi-generational
 

6411
01:51:24,159 --> 01:51:25,589
really challenging in multi-generational
homes in l.a county for instance there's

6412
01:51:25,589 --> 01:51:25,599
homes in l.a county for instance there's
 

6413
01:51:25,599 --> 01:51:27,510
homes in l.a county for instance there's
a lot of

6414
01:51:27,510 --> 01:51:27,520
a lot of
 

6415
01:51:27,520 --> 01:51:28,790
a lot of
older people living together with

6416
01:51:28,790 --> 01:51:28,800
older people living together with
 

6417
01:51:28,800 --> 01:51:31,510
older people living together with
younger people in relatively crowded

6418
01:51:31,510 --> 01:51:31,520
younger people in relatively crowded
 

6419
01:51:31,520 --> 01:51:33,350
younger people in relatively crowded
they're they're it's really quite a

6420
01:51:33,350 --> 01:51:33,360
they're they're it's really quite a
 

6421
01:51:33,360 --> 01:51:35,030
they're they're it's really quite a
challenge but there again you can use

6422
01:51:35,030 --> 01:51:35,040
challenge but there again you can use
 

6423
01:51:35,040 --> 01:51:38,390
challenge but there again you can use
resources so if grandma uh

6424
01:51:38,390 --> 01:51:38,400
resources so if grandma uh
 

6425
01:51:38,400 --> 01:51:40,629
resources so if grandma uh
is worried that grandson has come home

6426
01:51:40,629 --> 01:51:40,639
is worried that grandson has come home
 

6427
01:51:40,639 --> 01:51:42,229
is worried that grandson has come home
but is potentially been exposed grandson

6428
01:51:42,229 --> 01:51:42,239
but is potentially been exposed grandson
 

6429
01:51:42,239 --> 01:51:43,750
but is potentially been exposed grandson
calls grandma says i've been i might

6430
01:51:43,750 --> 01:51:43,760
calls grandma says i've been i might
 

6431

01:51:45,199 --> 01:51:47,669
have been at a party where i might do
that where covid was grandma calls

6434
01:51:47,669 --> 01:51:47,679
that where covid was grandma calls
 

6435
01:51:47,679 --> 01:51:49,030
that where covid was grandma calls
public health public health and then

6436
01:51:49,030 --> 01:51:49,040
public health public health and then

6600
01:54:34,390 --> 01:54:34,400
think into the summer i think there was
 

6601
01:54:34,400 --> 01:54:37,030
think into the summer i think there was
some some of that sense uh i don't know

6602
01:54:37,030 --> 01:54:37,040
some some of that sense uh i don't know
 

6603
01:54:37,040 --> 01:54:38,390
some some of that sense uh i don't know
they're obviously varied among different

6604
01:54:38,390 --> 01:54:38,400
they're obviously varied among different
 

6605
01:54:38,400 --> 01:54:39,669
they're obviously varied among different
people but um

6606
01:54:39,669 --> 01:54:39,679
people but um
 

6607
01:54:39,679 --> 01:54:41,589
people but um
but i think that it's true it would have

6608
01:54:41,589 --> 01:54:41,599
but i think that it's true it would have
 

6609
01:54:41,599 --> 01:54:43,350
but i think that it's true it would have
been challenging it's also true that

6610
01:54:43,350 --> 01:54:43,360
been challenging it's also true that
 

6611
01:54:43,360 --> 01:54:45,589
been challenging it's also true that
it's heterogeneous exactly the way you

6612
01:54:45,589 --> 01:54:45,599
it's heterogeneous exactly the way you
 

6613
01:54:45,599 --> 01:54:47,910
it's heterogeneous exactly the way you
said um but what that means is you need

6614
01:54:47,910 --> 01:54:47,920
said um but what that means is you need
 

6615
01:54:47,920 --> 01:54:49,750
said um but what that means is you need
a local response

6616
01:54:49,750 --> 01:54:49,760
a local response
 

6617
01:54:49,760 --> 01:54:52,390
a local response
a response so like like my vision of a

6618
01:54:52,390 --> 01:54:52,400
a response so like like my vision of a
 

6619
01:54:52,400 --> 01:54:53,990
a response so like like my vision of a
public health officer is someone that

6620
01:54:53,990 --> 01:54:54,000
public health officer is someone that
 

6621
01:54:54,000 --> 01:54:56,470
public health officer is someone that
understands their community

6622
01:54:56,470 --> 01:54:56,480
understands their community
 

6623
01:54:56,480 --> 01:54:58,149
understands their community
not not necessarily the nation at large

6624
01:54:58,149 --> 01:54:58,159
not not necessarily the nation at large
 

6625
01:54:58,159 --> 01:55:00,229
not not necessarily the nation at large
but their community and then works

6626
01:55:00,229 --> 01:55:00,239
but their community and then works
 

6627
01:55:00,239 --> 01:55:01,990
but their community and then works
within their community to figure out how

6628
01:55:01,990 --> 01:55:02,000
within their community to figure out how
 

6629
01:55:02,000 --> 01:55:03,589
within their community to figure out how
to deploy the resources that have

6630
01:55:03,589 --> 01:55:03,599
to deploy the resources that have
 

6631
01:55:03,599 --> 01:55:05,030
to deploy the resources that have
available

6632
01:55:05,030 --> 01:55:05,040
available
 

6633
01:55:05,040 --> 01:55:07,350
available
um to do the kind of protection policies

6634
01:55:07,350 --> 01:55:07,360
um to do the kind of protection policies
 

6635
01:55:07,360 --> 01:55:08,790
um to do the kind of protection policies
we're talking about that's that's what

6636
01:55:08,790 --> 01:55:08,800
we're talking about that's that's what
 

6637
01:55:08,800 --> 01:55:10,950
we're talking about that's that's what
should have happened instead they spent

6638
01:55:10,950 --> 01:55:10,960
should have happened instead they spent
 

6639
01:55:10,960 --> 01:55:13,350
should have happened instead they spent
a huge amount of efforts closing making

6640
01:55:13,350 --> 01:55:13,360
a huge amount of efforts closing making
 

6641
01:55:13,360 --> 01:55:15,430
a huge amount of efforts closing making
sure businesses stayed closed

6642
01:55:15,430 --> 01:55:15,440
sure businesses stayed closed
 

6643
01:55:15,440 --> 01:55:16,790
sure businesses stayed closed
businesses that

6644
01:55:16,790 --> 01:55:16,800
businesses that
 

6645
01:55:16,800 --> 01:55:18,870
businesses that
i mean there were you know like hardware

6646
01:55:18,870 --> 01:55:18,880
i mean there were you know like hardware
 

6647
01:55:18,880 --> 01:55:20,709
i mean there were you know like hardware
stores that closed

6648
01:55:20,709 --> 01:55:20,719
stores that closed
 

6649
01:55:20,719 --> 01:55:22,470
stores that closed
what good did closing a hardware store

6650
01:55:22,470 --> 01:55:22,480
what good did closing a hardware store
 

6651
01:55:22,480 --> 01:55:23,830
what good did closing a hardware store
do

6652
01:55:23,830 --> 01:55:23,840
do
 

6653
01:55:23,840 --> 01:55:25,430
do
for the spreader club if it had an

6654
01:55:25,430 --> 01:55:25,440
for the spreader club if it had an
 

6655
01:55:25,440 --> 01:55:27,270
for the spreader club if it had an
effect on spread covert spread i mean

6656
01:55:27,270 --> 01:55:27,280
effect on spread covert spread i mean
 

6657
01:55:27,280 --> 01:55:28,790
effect on spread covert spread i mean
it's going to be checking to make sure

6658
01:55:28,790 --> 01:55:28,800
it's going to be checking to make sure
 

6659
01:55:28,800 --> 01:55:30,950
it's going to be checking to make sure
that plexiglas was put up everywhere

6660
01:55:30,950 --> 01:55:30,960
that plexiglas was put up everywhere
 

6661
01:55:30,960 --> 01:55:32,470
that plexiglas was put up everywhere
which now in retrospect turns out to

6662
01:55:32,470 --> 01:55:32,480
which now in retrospect turns out to
 

6663
01:55:32,480 --> 01:55:35,430
which now in retrospect turns out to
have probably made the disease worse

6664
01:55:35,430 --> 01:55:35,440
have probably made the disease worse
 

6665
01:55:35,440 --> 01:55:36,870
have probably made the disease worse
um

6666
01:55:36,870 --> 01:55:36,880
um
 

6667
01:55:36,880 --> 01:55:38,950
um
you know masking enforcement

6668
01:55:38,950 --> 01:55:38,960
you know masking enforcement
 

6669
01:55:38,960 --> 01:55:41,030
you know masking enforcement
so shaming around mask i mean a huge

6670
01:55:41,030 --> 01:55:41,040
so shaming around mask i mean a huge
 

6671
01:55:41,040 --> 01:55:43,830
so shaming around mask i mean a huge
amount of effort on things that were

6672
01:55:43,830 --> 01:55:43,840
amount of effort on things that were
 

6673
01:55:43,840 --> 01:55:46,070
amount of effort on things that were
only tangentially related to focus

6674
01:55:46,070 --> 01:55:46,080
only tangentially related to focus
 

6675
01:55:46,080 --> 01:55:49,109
only tangentially related to focus
protection what if we turned our energy

6676
01:55:49,109 --> 01:55:49,119
protection what if we turned our energy
 

6677
01:55:49,119 --> 01:55:52,149
protection what if we turned our energy
that enormous energy put into that

6678
01:55:52,149 --> 01:55:52,159
that enormous energy put into that
 

6679
01:55:52,159 --> 01:55:53,830
that enormous energy put into that
instead into focused protection of the

6680
01:55:53,830 --> 01:55:53,840
instead into focused protection of the
 

6681
01:55:53,840 --> 01:55:55,109
instead into focused protection of the
vulnerable that's essentially the

6682
01:55:55,109 --> 01:55:55,119
vulnerable that's essentially the
 

6683
01:55:55,119 --> 01:55:56,950
vulnerable that's essentially the
conversation i was calling for

6684
01:55:56,950 --> 01:55:56,960
conversation i was calling for
 

6685
01:55:56,960 --> 01:55:59,109
conversation i was calling for
and it wasn't i mean i didn't think of

6686
01:55:59,109 --> 01:55:59,119
and it wasn't i mean i didn't think of
 

6687
01:55:59,119 --> 01:56:01,030
and it wasn't i mean i didn't think of
it as we had every single idea i mean we

6688
01:56:01,030 --> 01:56:01,040
it as we had every single idea i mean we
 

6689
01:56:01,040 --> 01:56:03,030
it as we had every single idea i mean we
gave some concrete proposals

6690
01:56:03,030 --> 01:56:03,040
gave some concrete proposals
 

6691
01:56:03,040 --> 01:56:04,550
gave some concrete proposals
and we got but the criticism we got was

6692
01:56:04,550 --> 01:56:04,560
and we got but the criticism we got was
 

6693
01:56:04,560 --> 01:56:06,070
and we got but the criticism we got was
that those those concrete proposals

6694
01:56:06,070 --> 01:56:06,080
that those those concrete proposals
 

6695
01:56:06,080 --> 01:56:07,990
that those those concrete proposals
weren't enough

6696
01:56:07,990 --> 01:56:08,000
weren't enough
 

6697
01:56:08,000 --> 01:56:09,830
weren't enough
and the answer to that i have is that's

6698
01:56:09,830 --> 01:56:09,840
and the answer to that i have is that's
 

6699
01:56:09,840 --> 01:56:11,430
and the answer to that i have is that's
true they weren't enough i wasn't

6700
01:56:11,430 --> 01:56:11,440
true they weren't enough i wasn't
 

6701
01:56:11,440 --> 01:56:12,709
true they weren't enough i wasn't
thinking of them as enough i was

6702
01:56:12,709 --> 01:56:12,719
thinking of them as enough i was
 

6703
01:56:12,719 --> 01:56:14,470
thinking of them as enough i was
thinking that they would i wanted to

6704
01:56:14,470 --> 01:56:14,480
thinking that they would i wanted to
 

6705
01:56:14,480 --> 01:56:16,550
thinking that they would i wanted to
involve an enormous number of people in

6706
01:56:16,550 --> 01:56:16,560
involve an enormous number of people in
 

6707
01:56:16,560 --> 01:56:19,430
involve an enormous number of people in
local public health to help think about

6708
01:56:19,430 --> 01:56:19,440
local public health to help think about
 

6709
01:56:19,440 --> 01:56:21,189
local public health to help think about
how to do focus protection in their

6710
01:56:21,189 --> 01:56:21,199
how to do focus protection in their
 

6711
01:56:21,199 --> 01:56:23,189
how to do focus protection in their
communities

6712
01:56:23,189 --> 01:56:23,199
communities
 

6713
01:56:23,199 --> 01:56:25,910
communities
the question that's interesting here is

6714
01:56:25,910 --> 01:56:25,920
the question that's interesting here is
 

6715
01:56:25,920 --> 01:56:28,870
the question that's interesting here is
about the future too

6716
01:56:28,870 --> 01:56:28,880
about the future too
 

6717
01:56:28,880 --> 01:56:31,750
about the future too
uh so uh covet has very specific

6718
01:56:31,750 --> 01:56:31,760
uh so uh covet has very specific
 

6719
01:56:31,760 --> 01:56:33,350
uh so uh covet has very specific
characteristics like you mentioned about

6720
01:56:33,350 --> 01:56:33,360
characteristics like you mentioned about
 

6721
01:56:33,360 --> 01:56:36,149
characteristics like you mentioned about
the curve of the the the death rate

6722
01:56:36,149 --> 01:56:36,159
the curve of the the the death rate
 

6723
01:56:36,159 --> 01:56:38,629
the curve of the the the death rate
based on the like it's it's uh it seems

6724
01:56:38,629 --> 01:56:38,639
based on the like it's it's uh it seems
 

6725
01:56:38,639 --> 01:56:40,390
based on the like it's it's uh it seems
like with covid it's a little bit easier

6726
01:56:40,390 --> 01:56:40,400
like with covid it's a little bit easier
 

6727
01:56:40,400 --> 01:56:43,189
like with covid it's a little bit easier
to actually identify a group of people

6728
01:56:43,189 --> 01:56:43,199
to actually identify a group of people
 

6729
01:56:43,199 --> 01:56:45,510
to actually identify a group of people
that you need to protect

6730
01:56:45,510 --> 01:56:45,520
that you need to protect
 

6731
01:56:45,520 --> 01:56:49,109
that you need to protect
so other viruses may not be this way so

6732
01:56:49,109 --> 01:56:49,119
so other viruses may not be this way so
 

6733
01:56:49,119 --> 01:56:52,310
so other viruses may not be this way so
might lock down be a good idea like hard

6734
01:56:52,310 --> 01:56:52,320
might lock down be a good idea like hard
 

6735
01:56:52,320 --> 01:56:55,350
might lock down be a good idea like hard
core lockdown for future virus

6736
01:56:55,350 --> 01:56:55,360
core lockdown for future virus
 

6737
01:56:55,360 --> 01:56:58,149
core lockdown for future virus
that's 10 times deadlier but spreads at

6738
01:56:58,149 --> 01:56:58,159
that's 10 times deadlier but spreads at
 

6739
01:56:58,159 --> 01:57:00,470
that's 10 times deadlier but spreads at
the same rate as covid or maybe another

6740
01:57:00,470 --> 01:57:00,480
the same rate as covid or maybe another
 

6741
01:57:00,480 --> 01:57:02,709
the same rate as covid or maybe another
way to ask that is imagine a virus

6742
01:57:02,709 --> 01:57:02,719
way to ask that is imagine a virus
 

6743
01:57:02,719 --> 01:57:04,470
way to ask that is imagine a virus
that's 10 times deadlier what's the

6744
01:57:04,470 --> 01:57:04,480
that's 10 times deadlier what's the
 

6745
01:57:04,480 --> 01:57:06,070
that's 10 times deadlier what's the
right response

6746
01:57:06,070 --> 01:57:06,080
right response
 

6747
01:57:06,080 --> 01:57:07,510
right response
i mean i think it's always going to be

6748
01:57:07,510 --> 01:57:07,520
i mean i think it's always going to be
 

6749
01:57:07,520 --> 01:57:10,070
i mean i think it's always going to be
focus protection but the group that

6750
01:57:10,070 --> 01:57:10,080
focus protection but the group that
 

6751
01:57:10,080 --> 01:57:11,990
focus protection but the group that
needs the focus protection may change

6752
01:57:11,990 --> 01:57:12,000
needs the focus protection may change
 

6753
01:57:12,000 --> 01:57:14,070
needs the focus protection may change
depending on the biology of the virus

6754
01:57:14,070 --> 01:57:14,080
depending on the biology of the virus
 

6755
01:57:14,080 --> 01:57:15,589
depending on the biology of the virus
right so the polio

6756
01:57:15,589 --> 01:57:15,599
right so the polio
 

6757
01:57:15,599 --> 01:57:18,470
right so the polio
epidemic in the 40s and 50s in the u.s

6758
01:57:18,470 --> 01:57:18,480
epidemic in the 40s and 50s in the u.s
 

6759
01:57:18,480 --> 01:57:21,109
epidemic in the 40s and 50s in the u.s
the the great the people at most risk

6760
01:57:21,109 --> 01:57:21,119
the the great the people at most risk
 

6761
01:57:21,119 --> 01:57:23,030
the the great the people at most risk
were children

6762
01:57:23,030 --> 01:57:23,040
were children
 

6763
01:57:23,040 --> 01:57:24,790
were children
we didn't know really at the beginning

6764
01:57:24,790 --> 01:57:24,800
we didn't know really at the beginning
 

6765
01:57:24,800 --> 01:57:26,870
we didn't know really at the beginning
there was this vehicle oral spread

6766
01:57:26,870 --> 01:57:26,880
there was this vehicle oral spread
 

6767
01:57:26,880 --> 01:57:29,510
there was this vehicle oral spread
and so we did all kinds of crazy things

6768
01:57:29,510 --> 01:57:29,520
and so we did all kinds of crazy things
 

6769
01:57:29,520 --> 01:57:30,310
and so we did all kinds of crazy things
um

6770
01:57:30,310 --> 01:57:30,320
um
 

6771
01:57:30,320 --> 01:57:32,629
um
including like spreading spraying ddt in

6772
01:57:32,629 --> 01:57:32,639
including like spreading spraying ddt in
 

6773
01:57:32,639 --> 01:57:34,149
including like spreading spraying ddt in
communities

6774
01:57:34,149 --> 01:57:34,159
communities
 

6775
01:57:34,159 --> 01:57:35,669
communities
which was somehow supposed to get rid of

6776
01:57:35,669 --> 01:57:35,679
which was somehow supposed to get rid of
 

6777
01:57:35,679 --> 01:57:39,189
which was somehow supposed to get rid of
polio um but the focus was on whenever

6778
01:57:39,189 --> 01:57:39,199
polio um but the focus was on whenever
 

6779
01:57:39,199 --> 01:57:40,470
polio um but the focus was on whenever
there was an outbreak they would close a

6780
01:57:40,470 --> 01:57:40,480
there was an outbreak they would close a
 

6781
01:57:40,480 --> 01:57:41,910
there was an outbreak they would close a
school down

6782
01:57:41,910 --> 01:57:41,920
school down
 

6783
01:57:41,920 --> 01:57:43,589
school down
and that was the right thing to do

6784
01:57:43,589 --> 01:57:43,599
and that was the right thing to do
 

6785
01:57:43,599 --> 01:57:45,510
and that was the right thing to do
because that group that needed

6786
01:57:45,510 --> 01:57:45,520
because that group that needed
 

6787
01:57:45,520 --> 01:57:46,790
because that group that needed
protection

6788
01:57:46,790 --> 01:57:46,800
protection
 

6789
01:57:46,800 --> 01:57:48,149
protection
where it was

6790
01:57:48,149 --> 01:57:48,159
where it was
 

6791
01:57:48,159 --> 01:57:49,830
where it was
children and those the disease was

6792
01:57:49,830 --> 01:57:49,840
children and those the disease was
 

6793
01:57:49,840 --> 01:57:53,430
children and those the disease was
spread we thought in schools

6794
01:57:53,430 --> 01:57:53,440
spread we thought in schools
 

6795
01:57:53,440 --> 01:57:55,350
spread we thought in schools
i don't think there's a single formula

6796
01:57:55,350 --> 01:57:55,360
i don't think there's a single formula
 

6797
01:57:55,360 --> 01:57:57,270
i don't think there's a single formula
that works but there's a single

6798
01:57:57,270 --> 01:57:57,280
that works but there's a single
 

6799
01:57:57,280 --> 01:58:00,070
that works but there's a single
principle that works right no matter i

6800
01:58:00,070 --> 01:58:00,080
principle that works right no matter i
 

6801
01:58:00,080 --> 01:58:02,070
principle that works right no matter i
can't it's hard to imagine a disease

6802
01:58:02,070 --> 01:58:02,080
can't it's hard to imagine a disease
 

6803
01:58:02,080 --> 01:58:04,950
can't it's hard to imagine a disease
that's uniformly deadly across every

6804
01:58:04,950 --> 01:58:04,960
that's uniformly deadly across every
 

6805
01:58:04,960 --> 01:58:07,030
that's uniformly deadly across every
group and every single person

6806
01:58:07,030 --> 01:58:07,040
group and every single person
 

6807
01:58:07,040 --> 01:58:09,589
group and every single person
there's always going to be some group

6808
01:58:09,589 --> 01:58:09,599
there's always going to be some group
 

6809
01:58:09,599 --> 01:58:12,229
there's always going to be some group
that's differentially

6810
01:58:12,229 --> 01:58:12,239
that's differentially
 

6811
01:58:12,239 --> 01:58:13,350
that's differentially
harmed

6812
01:58:13,350 --> 01:58:13,360
harmed
 

6813
01:58:13,360 --> 01:58:14,629
harmed
uh there's always going to be some group

6814
01:58:14,629 --> 01:58:14,639
uh there's always going to be some group
 

6815
01:58:14,639 --> 01:58:16,470
uh there's always going to be some group
that's differentially protected and that

6816
01:58:16,470 --> 01:58:16,480
that's differentially protected and that
 

6817
01:58:16,480 --> 01:58:18,229
that's differentially protected and that
that may change over time right so like

6818
01:58:18,229 --> 01:58:18,239
that may change over time right so like
 

6819
01:58:18,239 --> 01:58:20,550
that may change over time right so like
the in the uh

6820
01:58:20,550 --> 01:58:20,560
the in the uh
 

6821
01:58:20,560 --> 01:58:23,270
the in the uh
in this disease in this epidemic

6822
01:58:23,270 --> 01:58:23,280
in this disease in this epidemic
 

6823
01:58:23,280 --> 01:58:25,910
in this disease in this epidemic
as people got infected and recovered we

6824
01:58:25,910 --> 01:58:25,920
as people got infected and recovered we
 

6825
01:58:25,920 --> 01:58:27,270
as people got infected and recovered we
now had a class of people that were

6826
01:58:27,270 --> 01:58:27,280
now had a class of people that were
 

6827
01:58:27,280 --> 01:58:28,470
now had a class of people that were
pretty well protected against the

6828
01:58:28,470 --> 01:58:28,480
pretty well protected against the
 

6829
01:58:28,480 --> 01:58:30,870
pretty well protected against the
disease

6830
01:58:30,870 --> 01:58:30,880
disease
 

6831
01:58:30,880 --> 01:58:32,790
disease
they should be they would like instead

6832
01:58:32,790 --> 01:58:32,800
they should be they would like instead
 

6833
01:58:32,800 --> 01:58:34,629
they should be they would like instead
of ostracizing them because they don't

6834
01:58:34,629 --> 01:58:34,639
of ostracizing them because they don't
 

6835
01:58:34,639 --> 01:58:36,709
of ostracizing them because they don't
want a vaccine we should we should be

6836
01:58:36,709 --> 01:58:36,719
want a vaccine we should we should be
 

6837
01:58:36,719 --> 01:58:38,229
want a vaccine we should we should be
allowing them to work i mean we're

6838
01:58:38,229 --> 01:58:38,239
allowing them to work i mean we're
 

6839
01:58:38,239 --> 01:58:39,109
allowing them to work i mean we're
having

6840
01:58:39,109 --> 01:58:39,119
having
 

6841
01:58:39,119 --> 01:58:41,109
having
staffing shortages in hospitals now

6842
01:58:41,109 --> 01:58:41,119
staffing shortages in hospitals now
 

6843
01:58:41,119 --> 01:58:43,270
staffing shortages in hospitals now
because we forgot that principle

6844
01:58:43,270 --> 01:58:43,280
because we forgot that principle
 

6845
01:58:43,280 --> 01:58:44,390
because we forgot that principle
is uh

6846
01:58:44,390 --> 01:58:44,400
is uh
 

6847
01:58:44,400 --> 01:58:46,470
is uh
quite a bit of this a technology problem

6848
01:58:46,470 --> 01:58:46,480
quite a bit of this a technology problem
 

6849
01:58:46,480 --> 01:58:49,830
quite a bit of this a technology problem
so being able to so some of it how much

6850
01:58:49,830 --> 01:58:49,840
so being able to so some of it how much
 

6851
01:58:49,840 --> 01:58:53,510
so being able to so some of it how much
of it is this uh sociological problem

6852
01:58:53,510 --> 01:58:53,520
of it is this uh sociological problem
 

6853
01:58:53,520 --> 01:58:55,030
of it is this uh sociological problem
uh how much of it is a technology

6854
01:58:55,030 --> 01:58:55,040
uh how much of it is a technology
 

6855
01:58:55,040 --> 01:58:56,229
uh how much of it is a technology
problem

6856
01:58:56,229 --> 01:58:56,239
problem
 

6857
01:58:56,239 --> 01:58:58,950
problem
like where do you uh put the blame

6858
01:58:58,950 --> 01:58:58,960
like where do you uh put the blame
 

6859
01:58:58,960 --> 01:59:01,510
like where do you uh put the blame
sort of on why this didn't go so great

6860
01:59:01,510 --> 01:59:01,520
sort of on why this didn't go so great
 

6861
01:59:01,520 --> 01:59:03,990
sort of on why this didn't go so great
and how it can go great in the beginning

6862
01:59:03,990 --> 01:59:04,000
and how it can go great in the beginning
 

6863
01:59:04,000 --> 01:59:05,990
and how it can go great in the beginning
i mean think about lockdowns like if we

6864
01:59:05,990 --> 01:59:06,000
i mean think about lockdowns like if we
 

6865
01:59:06,000 --> 01:59:07,430
i mean think about lockdowns like if we
didn't have zoom we wouldn't have

6866
01:59:07,430 --> 01:59:07,440
didn't have zoom we wouldn't have
 

6867
01:59:07,440 --> 01:59:09,270
didn't have zoom we wouldn't have
lockdowns right there's

6868
01:59:09,270 --> 01:59:09,280
lockdowns right there's
 

6869
01:59:09,280 --> 01:59:11,189
lockdowns right there's
there's a reason in 2009 we didn't lock

6870
01:59:11,189 --> 01:59:11,199
there's a reason in 2009 we didn't lock
 

6871
01:59:11,199 --> 01:59:12,310
there's a reason in 2009 we didn't lock
down i mean we didn't have the

6872
01:59:12,310 --> 01:59:12,320
down i mean we didn't have the
 

6873
01:59:12,320 --> 01:59:13,910
down i mean we didn't have the
technology to replace work with this

6874
01:59:13,910 --> 01:59:13,920
technology to replace work with this
 

6875
01:59:13,920 --> 01:59:14,870
technology to replace work with this
remote

6876
01:59:14,870 --> 01:59:14,880
remote
 

6877
01:59:14,880 --> 01:59:17,830
remote
um with this remote technology

6878
01:59:17,830 --> 01:59:17,840
um with this remote technology
 

6879
01:59:17,840 --> 01:59:20,470
um with this remote technology
so we had good lockdown technology yeah

6880
01:59:20,470 --> 01:59:20,480
so we had good lockdown technology yeah
 

6881
01:59:20,480 --> 01:59:22,950
so we had good lockdown technology yeah
and zoom we didn't have

6882
01:59:22,950 --> 01:59:22,960
and zoom we didn't have
 

6883
01:59:22,960 --> 01:59:25,430
and zoom we didn't have
good focus protection technology yeah i

6884
01:59:25,430 --> 01:59:25,440
good focus protection technology yeah i
 

6885
01:59:25,440 --> 01:59:26,550
good focus protection technology yeah i
mean focus protection is always going to

6886
01:59:26,550 --> 01:59:26,560
mean focus protection is always going to
 

6887
01:59:26,560 --> 01:59:27,990
mean focus protection is always going to
be complicated especially for something

6888
01:59:27,990 --> 01:59:28,000
be complicated especially for something
 

6889
01:59:28,000 --> 01:59:29,510
be complicated especially for something
like this that's spread so easily it's

6890
01:59:29,510 --> 01:59:29,520
like this that's spread so easily it's
 

6891
01:59:29,520 --> 01:59:32,390
like this that's spread so easily it's
going to be complicated and i'm i'm very

6892
01:59:32,390 --> 01:59:32,400
going to be complicated and i'm i'm very
 

6893
01:59:32,400 --> 01:59:33,750
going to be complicated and i'm i'm very
i'm the last person to say would have

6894
01:59:33,750 --> 01:59:33,760
i'm the last person to say would have
 

6895
01:59:33,760 --> 01:59:35,750
i'm the last person to say would have
been perfect there's there would have

6896
01:59:35,750 --> 01:59:35,760
been perfect there's there would have
 

6897
01:59:35,760 --> 01:59:37,589
been perfect there's there would have
been people that would have gotten sick

6898
01:59:37,589 --> 01:59:37,599
been people that would have gotten sick
 

6899
01:59:37,599 --> 01:59:39,589
been people that would have gotten sick
but they got sick anyways the hope was

6900
01:59:39,589 --> 01:59:39,599
but they got sick anyways the hope was
 

6901
01:59:39,599 --> 01:59:41,669
but they got sick anyways the hope was
that if we suppress community spread low

6902
01:59:41,669 --> 01:59:41,679
that if we suppress community spread low
 

6903
01:59:41,679 --> 01:59:42,709
that if we suppress community spread low
enough

6904
01:59:42,709 --> 01:59:42,719
enough
 

6905
01:59:42,719 --> 01:59:44,390
enough
we can protect the vulnerable

6906
01:59:44,390 --> 01:59:44,400
we can protect the vulnerable
 

6907
01:59:44,400 --> 01:59:47,030
we can protect the vulnerable
that was the hope by lockdown

6908
01:59:47,030 --> 01:59:47,040
that was the hope by lockdown
 

6909
01:59:47,040 --> 01:59:48,950
that was the hope by lockdown
the reality was that

6910
01:59:48,950 --> 01:59:48,960
the reality was that
 

6911
01:59:48,960 --> 01:59:50,629
the reality was that
only a certain class of people were able

6912
01:59:50,629 --> 01:59:50,639
only a certain class of people were able
 

6913
01:59:50,639 --> 01:59:52,070
only a certain class of people were able
to benefit from a lockdown the rest of

6914
01:59:52,070 --> 01:59:52,080
to benefit from a lockdown the rest of
 

6915
01:59:52,080 --> 01:59:53,669
to benefit from a lockdown the rest of
society we call them essential workers

6916
01:59:53,669 --> 01:59:53,679
society we call them essential workers
 

6917
01:59:53,679 --> 01:59:55,669
society we call them essential workers
had to keep working and they got sick

had to keep working and they got sick
yeah

6920
01:59:56,470 --> 01:59:56,480
yeah
 

6921
01:59:56,480 --> 01:59:58,550
yeah
and the disease kept spreading it didn't

6922
01:59:58,550 --> 01:59:58,560
and the disease kept spreading it didn't
 

6923
01:59:58,560 --> 02:00:00,310
and the disease kept spreading it didn't
actually have a substantial effect on

and also we should probably expand the

02:00:07,430 --> 02:00:07,440
and also we should probably expand the
 

6931
02:00:07,440 --> 02:00:09,910
and also we should probably expand the
class of people who call vulnerable to

6932
02:00:09,910 --> 02:00:09,920
class of people who call vulnerable to
 

6933
02:00:09,920 --> 02:00:12,950
class of people who call vulnerable to
those who would suffer who have the

6934
02:00:12,950 --> 02:00:12,960
those who would suffer who have the
 

6935
02:00:12,960 --> 02:00:15,830
those who would suffer who have the
capacity to suffer

capacity to suffer
 

6937
02:00:15,840 --> 02:00:17,910
capacity to suffer
given the policies they're you're

given the policies they're you're
 

6939

weighing
 

6941
02:00:18,960 --> 02:00:20,310
weighing
it's very

6942
02:00:20,310 --> 02:00:20,320
it's very
 

6943
02:00:20,320 --> 02:00:22,870
it's very
disingenuous to call the vulnerable just

6944
02:00:22,870 --> 02:00:22,880
disingenuous to call the vulnerable just
 

6945
02:00:22,880 --> 02:00:24,070
disingenuous to call the vulnerable just

this is that principle you just said as
 

6959
02:00:38,080 --> 02:00:39,750
this is that principle you just said as
i completely agree with is is uh

i completely agree with is is uh

02:00:39,760 --> 02:00:41,830
i completely agree with is is uh
something i think has been lost

if at all from the vaccines of just a
very little bit because they face such a

7080
02:02:39,350 --> 02:02:39,360
very little bit because they face such a
 

7081
02:02:39,360 --> 02:02:42,870
very little bit because they face such a
low risk of harm from covid

7082

low risk of harm from covid
 

7083

also looking at the data
 

7125
02:03:28,480 --> 02:03:30,070
also looking at the data
seems

seems
 

7127
02:03:30,080 --> 02:03:30,750

in university policies around this given

02:03:37,589 --> 02:03:37,599
in university policies around this given

in university policies around this given
how healthy the student population is

7136
02:03:40,870 --> 02:03:40,880
how healthy the student population is
 

7137
02:03:40,880 --> 02:03:44,310
how healthy the student population is
seems not well calibrated let's put it

7138
02:03:44,310 --> 02:03:44,320
seems not well calibrated let's put it
 

7139
02:03:44,320 --> 02:03:47,030
seems not well calibrated let's put it
this way also pathological pathological

7140
02:03:47,030 --> 02:03:47,040
this way also pathological pathological
 

7141
02:03:47,040 --> 02:03:49,109
this way also pathological pathological
is one way to put it given that i

7142
02:03:49,109 --> 02:03:49,119
is one way to put it given that i
 

7143
02:03:49,119 --> 02:03:50,709
is one way to put it given that i
believe depending on the university but

7144
02:03:50,709 --> 02:03:50,719
believe depending on the university but
 

7145
02:03:50,719 --> 02:03:51,589
believe depending on the university but
i think

7146
02:03:51,589 --> 02:03:51,599
i think
 

7147
02:03:51,599 --> 02:03:53,350
i think
many universities require that the

7148
02:03:53,350 --> 02:03:53,360
many universities require that the
 

7149
02:03:53,360 --> 02:03:55,350
many universities require that the
student body is vaccinated

7150
02:03:55,350 --> 02:03:55,360
student body is vaccinated
 

7151
02:03:55,360 --> 02:03:57,030
student body is vaccinated
at this point

7152
02:03:57,030 --> 02:03:57,040
at this point
 

7153
02:03:57,040 --> 02:03:57,910
at this point
so

7154
02:03:57,910 --> 02:03:57,920
so
 

7155
02:03:57,920 --> 02:03:59,910
so
i think it's a big mistake by stanford

7156
02:03:59,910 --> 02:03:59,920
i think it's a big mistake by stanford
 

7157
02:03:59,920 --> 02:04:01,030
i think it's a big mistake by stanford
to do this

7158
02:04:01,030 --> 02:04:01,040
to do this
 

7159
02:04:01,040 --> 02:04:02,790
to do this
and um

7160
02:04:02,790 --> 02:04:02,800
and um
 

7161
02:04:02,800 --> 02:04:04,390
and um
i i'd like to say that because i just

7162
02:04:04,390 --> 02:04:04,400
i i'd like to say that because i just
 

7163
02:04:04,400 --> 02:04:07,270
i i'd like to say that because i just
hope mit doesn't

7164
02:04:07,270 --> 02:04:07,280
hope mit doesn't
 

7165
02:04:07,280 --> 02:04:08,709
hope mit doesn't
but what are your thoughts about

7166
02:04:08,709 --> 02:04:08,719
but what are your thoughts about
 

7167
02:04:08,719 --> 02:04:10,069
but what are your thoughts about
everything things

7168
02:04:10,069 --> 02:04:10,079
everything things
 

7169
02:04:10,079 --> 02:04:12,149
everything things
i completely agree with you i think um

7170
02:04:12,149 --> 02:04:12,159
i completely agree with you i think um
 

7171
02:04:12,159 --> 02:04:13,189
i completely agree with you i think um
we have

7172
02:04:13,189 --> 02:04:13,199
we have
 

7173
02:04:13,199 --> 02:04:14,870
we have
failed in our mission

7174
02:04:14,870 --> 02:04:14,880
failed in our mission
 

7175
02:04:14,880 --> 02:04:16,870
failed in our mission
to educate our students

7176
02:04:16,870 --> 02:04:16,880
to educate our students
 

7177
02:04:16,880 --> 02:04:19,750
to educate our students
by these this decision uh and i think i

7178
02:04:19,750 --> 02:04:19,760
by these this decision uh and i think i
 

7179
02:04:19,760 --> 02:04:21,189
by these this decision uh and i think i
frankly just more broadly i think we

7180
02:04:21,189 --> 02:04:21,199
frankly just more broadly i think we
 

7181
02:04:21,199 --> 02:04:23,030
frankly just more broadly i think we
failed generally over the course of the

7182
02:04:23,030 --> 02:04:23,040
failed generally over the course of the
 

7183
02:04:23,040 --> 02:04:25,030
failed generally over the course of the
last year and a half in living up to our

7184
02:04:25,030 --> 02:04:25,040
last year and a half in living up to our
 

7185
02:04:25,040 --> 02:04:27,669
last year and a half in living up to our
educational mission

7186
02:04:27,669 --> 02:04:27,679
educational mission
 

7187
02:04:27,679 --> 02:04:29,030
educational mission
the in-person

7188
02:04:29,030 --> 02:04:29,040
the in-person
 

7189
02:04:29,040 --> 02:04:31,430
the in-person
teaching is vital

7190
02:04:31,430 --> 02:04:31,440
teaching is vital
 

7191
02:04:31,440 --> 02:04:33,750
teaching is vital
for and now i can understand you have

7192
02:04:33,750 --> 02:04:33,760
for and now i can understand you have
 

7193
02:04:33,760 --> 02:04:35,510
for and now i can understand you have
you have older faculty

7194
02:04:35,510 --> 02:04:35,520
you have older faculty
 

7195
02:04:35,520 --> 02:04:37,109
you have older faculty
the principle of focus protection says

7196
02:04:37,109 --> 02:04:37,119
the principle of focus protection says
 

7197
02:04:37,119 --> 02:04:38,550
the principle of focus protection says
provide some alternative teaching

7198
02:04:38,550 --> 02:04:38,560
provide some alternative teaching
 

7199
02:04:38,560 --> 02:04:40,149
provide some alternative teaching
arrangements for them

7200
02:04:40,149 --> 02:04:40,159
arrangements for them
 

7201
02:04:40,159 --> 02:04:42,470
arrangements for them
that makes sense to me

7202
02:04:42,470 --> 02:04:42,480
that makes sense to me
 

7203
02:04:42,480 --> 02:04:44,310
that makes sense to me
from the kids point of view

7204
02:04:44,310 --> 02:04:44,320
from the kids point of view
 

7205
02:04:44,320 --> 02:04:46,310
from the kids point of view
they're more harmed by not getting the

7206
02:04:46,310 --> 02:04:46,320
they're more harmed by not getting the
 

7207
02:04:46,320 --> 02:04:48,310
they're more harmed by not getting the
education we promised them

7208
02:04:48,310 --> 02:04:48,320
education we promised them
 

7209
02:04:48,320 --> 02:04:51,350
education we promised them
than by than by covid

7210
02:04:51,350 --> 02:04:51,360
than by than by covid
 

7211
02:04:51,360 --> 02:04:53,589
than by than by covid
so applying this principle of this focus

7212
02:04:53,589 --> 02:04:53,599
so applying this principle of this focus
 

7213
02:04:53,599 --> 02:04:54,950
so applying this principle of this focus
protection

7214
02:04:54,950 --> 02:04:54,960
protection
 

7215
02:04:54,960 --> 02:04:57,990
protection
let young professors teach in person

7216
02:04:57,990 --> 02:04:58,000
let young professors teach in person
 

7217
02:04:58,000 --> 02:04:59,350
let young professors teach in person
this is before the vaccine after the

7218
02:04:59,350 --> 02:04:59,360
this is before the vaccine after the
 

7219
02:04:59,360 --> 02:05:01,109
this is before the vaccine after the
vaccine let everyone teach in person

7220
02:05:01,109 --> 02:05:01,119
vaccine let everyone teach in person
 

7221
02:05:01,119 --> 02:05:02,390
vaccine let everyone teach in person
yeah this this the part i don't

7222
02:05:02,390 --> 02:05:02,400
yeah this this the part i don't
 

7223
02:05:02,400 --> 02:05:03,750
yeah this this the part i don't
understand the discussion we're even

7224
02:05:03,750 --> 02:05:03,760
understand the discussion we're even
 

7225
02:05:03,760 --> 02:05:05,830
understand the discussion we're even
having

7226
02:05:05,830 --> 02:05:05,840
having
 

7227
02:05:05,840 --> 02:05:07,270
having
um

7228
02:05:07,270 --> 02:05:07,280
um
 

7229
02:05:07,280 --> 02:05:09,830
um
okay let's leave focus protection aside

7230
02:05:09,830 --> 02:05:09,840
okay let's leave focus protection aside
 

7231
02:05:09,840 --> 02:05:12,149
okay let's leave focus protection aside
here because that's a brilliant policy

7232
02:05:12,149 --> 02:05:12,159
here because that's a brilliant policy
 

7233
02:05:12,159 --> 02:05:14,149
here because that's a brilliant policy
for perhaps for the future when there's

7234
02:05:14,149 --> 02:05:14,159
for perhaps for the future when there's
 

7235
02:05:14,159 --> 02:05:15,669
for perhaps for the future when there's
no vaccine

7236
02:05:15,669 --> 02:05:15,679
no vaccine
 

7237
02:05:15,679 --> 02:05:17,790
no vaccine
now with the vaccine i'm i'm

7238
02:05:17,790 --> 02:05:17,800
now with the vaccine i'm i'm
 

7239
02:05:17,800 --> 02:05:20,390
now with the vaccine i'm i'm
misunderstanding something here because

7240
02:05:20,390 --> 02:05:20,400
misunderstanding something here because
 

7241
02:05:20,400 --> 02:05:22,629
misunderstanding something here because
we're now in a space

7242
02:05:22,629 --> 02:05:22,639
we're now in a space
 

7243
02:05:22,639 --> 02:05:23,589
we're now in a space
that's

7244
02:05:23,589 --> 02:05:23,599

02:06:06,480 --> 02:06:08,149
in the university setting i think the
universities the great university has

by modeling this kind of behavior yes
 

7291
02:06:12,480 --> 02:06:15,109
by modeling this kind of behavior yes
that to me decided to keep interrupting

02:06:15,109 --> 02:06:15,119
that to me decided to keep interrupting
 

7293
02:06:15,119 --> 02:06:17,189
that to me decided to keep interrupting
but to me the university should be the

but to me the university should be the
 

7295
02:06:17,199 --> 02:06:20,629
but to me the university should be the

let's not mess up

7302
02:06:26,390 --> 02:06:26,400
let's not mess up
 

7303
02:06:26,400 --> 02:06:28,149
let's not mess up
let's not make it pathological it's not

7304
02:06:28,149 --> 02:06:28,159
let's not make it pathological it's not
 

7305

let's not make it pathological it's not
make anybody angry let's it should be a

place to play in the space of ideas yes

7308
02:06:34,550 --> 02:06:34,560
place to play in the space of ideas yes
 

7309
02:06:34,560 --> 02:06:37,589
place to play in the space of ideas yes
so i think um the central problem is

7310
02:06:37,589 --> 02:06:37,599
so i think um the central problem is
 

7311
02:06:37,599 --> 02:06:38,950
so i think um the central problem is
actually related to the central problem

7312
02:06:38,950 --> 02:06:38,960
actually related to the central problem
 

7313
02:06:38,960 --> 02:06:41,270
actually related to the central problem
of covet policy more generally

7314
02:06:41,270 --> 02:06:41,280
of covet policy more generally
 

7315
02:06:41,280 --> 02:06:43,030
of covet policy more generally
the goal seems to be

7316
02:06:43,030 --> 02:06:43,040
the goal seems to be
 

7317
02:06:43,040 --> 02:06:46,229
the goal seems to be
to stop the disease from spreading

7318
02:06:46,229 --> 02:06:46,239
to stop the disease from spreading
 

7319
02:06:46,239 --> 02:06:48,950
to stop the disease from spreading
rather than to reduce the harm from the

7320
02:06:48,950 --> 02:06:48,960
rather than to reduce the harm from the
 

7321
02:06:48,960 --> 02:06:51,510
rather than to reduce the harm from the
disease

7322
02:06:51,510 --> 02:06:51,520

 

7323
02:06:51,520 --> 02:06:53,350

if the if the goal is to stop disease

7324
02:06:53,350 --> 02:06:53,360
if the if the goal is to stop disease
 

7325
02:06:53,360 --> 02:06:56,149
if the if the goal is to stop disease
and spreading the sad fact is we have no

7326
02:06:56,149 --> 02:06:56,159
and spreading the sad fact is we have no
 

7327
02:06:56,159 --> 02:06:59,109
and spreading the sad fact is we have no
technology to stop to accomplish that

7328
02:06:59,109 --> 02:06:59,119
technology to stop to accomplish that
 

7329
02:06:59,119 --> 02:07:01,589
technology to stop to accomplish that
at this point yes because like uh it's

7330
02:07:01,589 --> 02:07:01,599
at this point yes because like uh it's
 

7331
02:07:01,599 --> 02:07:04,069
at this point yes because like uh it's
already deeply integrated into the human

7332
02:07:04,069 --> 02:07:04,079
already deeply integrated into the human
 

7333
02:07:04,079 --> 02:07:06,069
already deeply integrated into the human
civilization well i mean it's here

7334
02:07:06,069 --> 02:07:06,079
civilization well i mean it's here
 

7335
02:07:06,079 --> 02:07:08,950
civilization well i mean it's here
forever right there's a zero survey of

7336
02:07:08,950 --> 02:07:08,960
forever right there's a zero survey of
 

7337
02:07:08,960 --> 02:07:11,270
forever right there's a zero survey of
white-tailed deer in the u.s it turns

7338
02:07:11,270 --> 02:07:11,280
white-tailed deer in the u.s it turns
 

7339
02:07:11,280 --> 02:07:12,870
white-tailed deer in the u.s it turns
out 80 percent of white-tailed deer in

7340
02:07:12,870 --> 02:07:12,880
out 80 percent of white-tailed deer in
 

7341
02:07:12,880 --> 02:07:15,669
out 80 percent of white-tailed deer in
the u.s have coveted antibodies

7342
02:07:15,669 --> 02:07:15,679
the u.s have coveted antibodies
 

7343
02:07:15,679 --> 02:07:17,830
the u.s have coveted antibodies
dogs get it cats get it

7344
02:07:17,830 --> 02:07:17,840
dogs get it cats get it
 

7345
02:07:17,840 --> 02:07:19,510
dogs get it cats get it
there's almost certainly human human

7346
02:07:19,510 --> 02:07:19,520
there's almost certainly human human
 

7347
02:07:19,520 --> 02:07:22,310
there's almost certainly human human
animal transmission of it um

7348
02:07:22,310 --> 02:07:22,320
animal transmission of it um
 

7349
02:07:22,320 --> 02:07:23,910
animal transmission of it um
i mean presumably i mean i've heard bats

7350
02:07:23,910 --> 02:07:23,920
i mean presumably i mean i've heard bats
 

7351
02:07:23,920 --> 02:07:25,430
i mean presumably i mean i've heard bats
get it apparently

7352
02:07:25,430 --> 02:07:25,440
get it apparently
 

7353
02:07:25,440 --> 02:07:27,589
get it apparently
so so you you have uh you have a

7354
02:07:27,589 --> 02:07:27,599
so so you you have uh you have a
 

7355
02:07:27,599 --> 02:07:29,430
so so you you have uh you have a
situation where you have this disease

7356
02:07:29,430 --> 02:07:29,440
situation where you have this disease
 

7357
02:07:29,440 --> 02:07:31,669
situation where you have this disease
that's here to stay yeah and it and the

7358
02:07:31,669 --> 02:07:31,679
that's here to stay yeah and it and the
 

7359
02:07:31,679 --> 02:07:33,350
that's here to stay yeah and it and the
vaccines don't stop the spread of it the

7360
02:07:33,350 --> 02:07:33,360
vaccines don't stop the spread of it the
 

7361
02:07:33,360 --> 02:07:35,030
vaccines don't stop the spread of it the
lockdowns don't stop spread it we have

7362
02:07:35,030 --> 02:07:35,040
lockdowns don't stop spread it we have
 

7363
02:07:35,040 --> 02:07:38,229
lockdowns don't stop spread it we have
no technology to stop the spread of it

7364
02:07:38,229 --> 02:07:38,239
no technology to stop the spread of it
 

7365
02:07:38,239 --> 02:07:40,149
no technology to stop the spread of it
um and so we're burning the earth trying

7366
02:07:40,149 --> 02:07:40,159
um and so we're burning the earth trying
 

7367
02:07:40,159 --> 02:07:42,950
um and so we're burning the earth trying
to stop do something that's impossible

7368
02:07:42,950 --> 02:07:42,960
to stop do something that's impossible
 

7369
02:07:42,960 --> 02:07:45,189
to stop do something that's impossible
rather than

7370
02:07:45,189 --> 02:07:45,199
rather than
 

7371
02:07:45,199 --> 02:07:47,189
rather than
working on what's possible

7372
02:07:47,189 --> 02:07:47,199
working on what's possible
 

7373
02:07:47,199 --> 02:07:50,470
working on what's possible
uh and so like you know like letting

7374
02:07:50,470 --> 02:07:50,480
uh and so like you know like letting
 

7375
02:07:50,480 --> 02:07:52,390
uh and so like you know like letting
regular college happen that's a great

7376
02:07:52,390 --> 02:07:52,400
regular college happen that's a great
 

7377
02:07:52,400 --> 02:07:55,109
regular college happen that's a great
good universities are a wonderful

7378
02:07:55,109 --> 02:07:55,119
good universities are a wonderful
 

7379
02:07:55,119 --> 02:07:56,310
good universities are a wonderful
invention

7380
02:07:56,310 --> 02:07:56,320
invention
 

7381
02:07:56,320 --> 02:07:58,629
invention
and it's contributed so much to society

7382
02:07:58,629 --> 02:07:58,639
and it's contributed so much to society
 

7383
02:07:58,639 --> 02:08:00,709
and it's contributed so much to society
to decide to shut it down

7384
02:08:00,709 --> 02:08:00,719
to decide to shut it down
 

7385
02:08:00,719 --> 02:08:02,629
to decide to shut it down
the universities should be fighting

7386
02:08:02,629 --> 02:08:02,639
the universities should be fighting
 

7387
02:08:02,639 --> 02:08:04,629
the universities should be fighting
tooth and nail to not be shut down not

7388
02:08:04,629 --> 02:08:04,639
tooth and nail to not be shut down not
 

7389
02:08:04,639 --> 02:08:07,030
tooth and nail to not be shut down not
the other way around yeah

7390
02:08:07,030 --> 02:08:07,040
the other way around yeah
 

7391
02:08:07,040 --> 02:08:09,189
the other way around yeah
whatever the mechanisms that uh results

7392
02:08:09,189 --> 02:08:09,199
whatever the mechanisms that uh results
 

7393
02:08:09,199 --> 02:08:10,629
whatever the mechanisms that uh results
in the universities doing that that's

7394
02:08:10,629 --> 02:08:10,639
in the universities doing that that's
 

7395
02:08:10,639 --> 02:08:12,870
in the universities doing that that's
probably this is me talking it probably

7396
02:08:12,870 --> 02:08:12,880
probably this is me talking it probably
 

7397
02:08:12,880 --> 02:08:14,470
probably this is me talking it probably

7400
02:08:16,069 --> 02:08:16,079
the administration probably has to do
 

7401
02:08:16,079 --> 02:08:17,830
the administration probably has to do
with lawyers and legal kinds of things

7402
02:08:17,830 --> 02:08:17,840
with lawyers and legal kinds of things
 

7403
02:08:17,840 --> 02:08:18,709
with lawyers and legal kinds of things
to

7404
02:08:18,709 --> 02:08:18,719
to
 

7405
02:08:18,719 --> 02:08:23,030
to
to avoid uh legal trouble but once again

we've been dancing around it is it
 

7445
02:09:00,960 --> 02:09:03,750
we've been dancing around it is it
useful is it destructive or is there

useful is it destructive or is there
 

7447
02:09:03,760 --> 02:09:06,069
useful is it destructive or is there
sort of a complicated story here because

02:09:06,069 --> 02:09:06,079
sort of a complicated story here because
 

7449
02:09:06,079 --> 02:09:07,910
sort of a complicated story here because
uh instead of taking us back into

7450
02:09:07,910 --> 02:09:07,920
uh instead of taking us back into

january 2020
 

7453
02:09:09,840 --> 02:09:11,750
january 2020
there's so much uncertainty this could

7454
02:09:11,750 --> 02:09:11,760
there's so much uncertainty this could
 

7455
02:09:11,760 --> 02:09:14,229
there's so much uncertainty this could
have been a pandemic that

7456
02:09:14,229 --> 02:09:14,239
have been a pandemic that
 

7457
02:09:14,239 --> 02:09:15,109
have been a pandemic that
um

7458
02:09:15,109 --> 02:09:15,119
um
 

7459
02:09:15,119 --> 02:09:17,830
um
is black death the bubonic plague it

7460
02:09:17,830 --> 02:09:17,840
is black death the bubonic plague it
 

7461
02:09:17,840 --> 02:09:19,510
is black death the bubonic plague it
could have killed

7462
02:09:19,510 --> 02:09:19,520
could have killed
 

7463
02:09:19,520 --> 02:09:21,270
could have killed
hundreds of millions of people we don't

7464
02:09:21,270 --> 02:09:21,280
hundreds of millions of people we don't
 

7465
02:09:21,280 --> 02:09:22,470
hundreds of millions of people we don't
know that

7466
02:09:22,470 --> 02:09:22,480
know that
 

7467
02:09:22,480 --> 02:09:24,390
know that
we're we're very new to this it's been a

7468
02:09:24,390 --> 02:09:24,400
we're we're very new to this it's been a
 

7469
02:09:24,400 --> 02:09:26,390
we're we're very new to this it's been a
while we're rusty

7470
02:09:26,390 --> 02:09:26,400
while we're rusty
 

7471
02:09:26,400 --> 02:09:28,790
while we're rusty
so like there is there is some value to

7472
02:09:28,790 --> 02:09:28,800
so like there is there is some value to
 

7473
02:09:28,800 --> 02:09:30,950
so like there is there is some value to
fear so that you don't do the stupid

7474
02:09:30,950 --> 02:09:30,960
fear so that you don't do the stupid
 

7475
02:09:30,960 --> 02:09:33,030
fear so that you don't do the stupid
thing you don't just go on living i

7476
02:09:33,030 --> 02:09:33,040
thing you don't just go on living i
 

7477
02:09:33,040 --> 02:09:34,390
thing you don't just go on living i
guess where i come from i think it's

7478
02:09:34,390 --> 02:09:34,400
guess where i come from i think it's
 

7479
02:09:34,400 --> 02:09:36,550
guess where i come from i think it's
almost entirely counterproductive

7480
02:09:36,550 --> 02:09:36,560
almost entirely counterproductive
 

7481
02:09:36,560 --> 02:09:39,189
almost entirely counterproductive
i think fear should never be used as a

7482
02:09:39,189 --> 02:09:39,199
i think fear should never be used as a
 

7483
02:09:39,199 --> 02:09:42,790
i think fear should never be used as a
tactic to manipulate human behavior

7484
02:09:42,790 --> 02:09:42,800
tactic to manipulate human behavior
 

7485
02:09:42,800 --> 02:09:44,870
tactic to manipulate human behavior
by public health so the fear on the

7486
02:09:44,870 --> 02:09:44,880
by public health so the fear on the
 

7487
02:09:44,880 --> 02:09:47,030
by public health so the fear on the
individual level

7488
02:09:47,030 --> 02:09:47,040
individual level
 

7489
02:09:47,040 --> 02:09:49,270
individual level
that feeling of fear you should be very

7490
02:09:49,270 --> 02:09:49,280
that feeling of fear you should be very
 

7491
02:09:49,280 --> 02:09:51,350
that feeling of fear you should be very
hesitant about that feeling because it

7492
02:09:51,350 --> 02:09:51,360
hesitant about that feeling because it
 

7493
02:09:51,360 --> 02:09:53,189
hesitant about that feeling because it
could be easily manipulated by the

7494
02:09:53,189 --> 02:09:53,199
could be easily manipulated by the
 

7495
02:09:53,199 --> 02:09:56,229
could be easily manipulated by the
powerful exactly so i think um that fear

7496
02:09:56,229 --> 02:09:56,239
powerful exactly so i think um that fear
 

7497
02:09:56,239 --> 02:09:57,830
powerful exactly so i think um that fear
is natural

7498
02:09:57,830 --> 02:09:57,840
is natural
 

7499
02:09:57,840 --> 02:10:00,550
is natural
and it it uh it's not something that you

7500
02:10:00,550 --> 02:10:00,560
and it it uh it's not something that you
 

7501
02:10:00,560 --> 02:10:02,310
and it it uh it's not something that you
have to you have to nest you have to

7502
02:10:02,310 --> 02:10:02,320
have to you have to nest you have to
 

7503
02:10:02,320 --> 02:10:04,550
have to you have to nest you have to
stoke to get when the facts on the

7504
02:10:04,550 --> 02:10:04,560
stoke to get when the facts on the
 

7505
02:10:04,560 --> 02:10:06,390
stoke to get when the facts on the
ground suggest it

7506
02:10:06,390 --> 02:10:06,400
ground suggest it
 

7507
02:10:06,400 --> 02:10:09,109
ground suggest it
right uh in fact the tendency for humans

7508
02:10:09,109 --> 02:10:09,119
right uh in fact the tendency for humans
 

7509
02:10:09,119 --> 02:10:11,270
right uh in fact the tendency for humans
in the in the face of

7510
02:10:11,270 --> 02:10:11,280
in the in the face of
 

7511
02:10:11,280 --> 02:10:13,669
in the in the face of
threats from infects disease is to is to

7512
02:10:13,669 --> 02:10:13,679
threats from infects disease is to is to
 

7513
02:10:13,679 --> 02:10:16,229
threats from infects disease is to is to
exaggerate the fear in their own minds

7514
02:10:16,229 --> 02:10:16,239
exaggerate the fear in their own minds
 

7515
02:10:16,239 --> 02:10:18,470
exaggerate the fear in their own minds
of the being contaminated by the

7516
02:10:18,470 --> 02:10:18,480
of the being contaminated by the
 

7517
02:10:18,480 --> 02:10:20,470
of the being contaminated by the
environment and by others that's just

7518
02:10:20,470 --> 02:10:20,480
environment and by others that's just
 

7519
02:10:20,480 --> 02:10:22,550
environment and by others that's just
natural to humans

7520
02:10:22,550 --> 02:10:22,560
natural to humans
 

7521
02:10:22,560 --> 02:10:23,510
natural to humans
and

7522
02:10:23,510 --> 02:10:23,520
and
 

7523
02:10:23,520 --> 02:10:25,669
and
the role of public health is not

7524
02:10:25,669 --> 02:10:25,679
the role of public health is not
 

7525
02:10:25,679 --> 02:10:27,830
the role of public health is not
necessarily to eradicate the fear but

7526
02:10:27,830 --> 02:10:27,840
necessarily to eradicate the fear but
 

7527
02:10:27,840 --> 02:10:29,270
necessarily to eradicate the fear but
like obviously technological advances

7528
02:10:29,270 --> 02:10:29,280
like obviously technological advances
 

7529
02:10:29,280 --> 02:10:31,030
like obviously technological advances
can help eradicate the fear but like but

7530
02:10:31,030 --> 02:10:31,040
can help eradicate the fear but like but
 

7531
02:10:31,040 --> 02:10:33,510
can help eradicate the fear but like but
it's really to help manage that fear

7532
02:10:33,510 --> 02:10:33,520
it's really to help manage that fear
 

7533
02:10:33,520 --> 02:10:34,550
it's really to help manage that fear
and

7534
02:10:34,550 --> 02:10:34,560
and
 

7535
02:10:34,560 --> 02:10:38,629
and
and uh help people put the the sort of

7536
02:10:38,629 --> 02:10:38,639
and uh help people put the the sort of
 

7537
02:10:38,639 --> 02:10:40,229
and uh help people put the the sort of
incentives that come out of that to

7538
02:10:40,229 --> 02:10:40,239
incentives that come out of that to
 

7539
02:10:40,239 --> 02:10:41,910
incentives that come out of that to
useful things as opposed to harmful

7540

7543
02:10:44,320 --> 02:10:46,470

what's happened in this pandemic is that

7544
02:10:46,470 --> 02:10:46,480
what's happened in this pandemic is that
 

7545
02:10:46,480 --> 02:10:48,310
what's happened in this pandemic is that
there's been a deliberate policy to

7546
02:10:48,310 --> 02:10:48,320
there's been a deliberate policy to
 

7547
02:10:48,320 --> 02:10:49,750
there's been a deliberate policy to
stoke the fear

7548
02:10:49,750 --> 02:10:49,760
stoke the fear
 

7549
02:10:49,760 --> 02:10:51,589
stoke the fear
to help make people think that the

7550
02:10:51,589 --> 02:10:51,599
to help make people think that the
 

7551
02:10:51,599 --> 02:10:54,069
to help make people think that the
disease is worse than it actually is

7552
02:10:54,069 --> 02:10:54,079
disease is worse than it actually is
 

7553
02:10:54,079 --> 02:10:56,470
disease is worse than it actually is
in survey after survey you see this

in survey after survey you see this
 

7555
02:10:56,480 --> 02:10:59,030
in survey after survey you see this
and that's been incredibly damaging so

7556
02:10:59,030 --> 02:10:59,040
and that's been incredibly damaging so
 

7557
02:10:59,040 --> 02:11:00,470
and that's been incredibly damaging so
young people

policies because i would like to mention

policies because i would like to mention
 

7589
02:11:27,360 --> 02:11:29,030
policies because i would like to mention
the flip side of that

7590
02:11:29,030 --> 02:11:29,040
the flip side of that
 

7591
02:11:29,040 --> 02:11:32,629
the flip side of that
i've been saddened to see how much money

7592
02:11:32,629 --> 02:11:32,639
i've been saddened to see how much money
 

7593
02:11:32,639 --> 02:11:34,709
i've been saddened to see how much money
there is to be made

7594
02:11:34,709 --> 02:11:34,719
there is to be made
 

7595
02:11:34,719 --> 02:11:37,350
there is to be made
by the martyrs

7596
02:11:37,350 --> 02:11:37,360
by the martyrs
 

7597
02:11:37,360 --> 02:11:38,550
by the martyrs
the people

7598
02:11:38,550 --> 02:11:38,560
the people
 

7599
02:11:38,560 --> 02:11:40,550
the people
the conspiracy theorists

7600
02:11:40,550 --> 02:11:40,560
the conspiracy theorists
 

7601
02:11:40,560 --> 02:11:42,790
the conspiracy theorists
that tell you

that tell you
you should be afraid of the government

7604
02:11:46,390 --> 02:11:46,400
you should be afraid of the government
 

7605
02:11:46,400 --> 02:11:49,109
you should be afraid of the government
you should be afraid of the man

7606
02:11:49,109 --> 02:11:49,119
you should be afraid of the man
 

7607
02:11:49,119 --> 02:11:51,669
you should be afraid of the man
it feels like fear is the problem i

7608
02:11:51,669 --> 02:11:51,679
it feels like fear is the problem i
 

7609
02:11:51,679 --> 02:11:53,270
it feels like fear is the problem i
think there's some guy that once said

7610
02:11:53,270 --> 02:11:53,280
think there's some guy that once said
 

7611
02:11:53,280 --> 02:11:54,870
think there's some guy that once said
something about we should be we should

7612
02:11:54,870 --> 02:11:54,880
something about we should be we should
 

7613
02:11:54,880 --> 02:11:57,510
something about we should be we should
fear fear itself

7614
02:11:57,510 --> 02:11:57,520
fear fear itself
 

7615
02:11:57,520 --> 02:11:58,709
fear fear itself
uh

7616
02:11:58,709 --> 02:11:58,719
uh
 

7617
02:11:58,719 --> 02:11:59,990
uh
he was a president or something i

7618
02:11:59,990 --> 02:12:00,000
he was a president or something i
 

7619
02:12:00,000 --> 02:12:01,669
he was a president or something i
vaguely remember that

7620
02:12:01,669 --> 02:12:01,679
vaguely remember that
 

7621
02:12:01,679 --> 02:12:04,550
vaguely remember that
so i i so i'm worried about both sides

7622
02:12:04,550 --> 02:12:04,560
so i i so i'm worried about both sides
 

7623
02:12:04,560 --> 02:12:06,870
so i i so i'm worried about both sides
here that well i just i think the

7624
02:12:06,870 --> 02:12:06,880
here that well i just i think the
 

7625
02:12:06,880 --> 02:12:08,790
here that well i just i think the
general principle is that should not be

7626
02:12:08,790 --> 02:12:08,800
general principle is that should not be
 

7627
02:12:08,800 --> 02:12:11,030
general principle is that should not be
a tool of public policy right

7628
02:12:11,030 --> 02:12:11,040
a tool of public policy right
 

7629
02:12:11,040 --> 02:12:12,950
a tool of public policy right
right the true the public policy should

7630
02:12:12,950 --> 02:12:12,960
right the true the public policy should
 

7631
02:12:12,960 --> 02:12:14,629
right the true the public policy should
attempt and public health policy in

7632
02:12:14,629 --> 02:12:14,639
attempt and public health policy in
 

7633
02:12:14,639 --> 02:12:15,830
attempt and public health policy in
particular should attempt to address

7634
02:12:15,830 --> 02:12:15,840
particular should attempt to address
 

7635
02:12:15,840 --> 02:12:16,950
particular should attempt to address
that fear

7636
02:12:16,950 --> 02:12:16,960
that fear
 

7637
02:12:16,960 --> 02:12:18,229
that fear
uh

7638
02:12:18,229 --> 02:12:18,239
uh
 

7639
02:12:18,239 --> 02:12:20,390
uh
it's not that you should

7640
02:12:20,390 --> 02:12:20,400
it's not that you should
 

7641
02:12:20,400 --> 02:12:22,950
it's not that you should
tell people lies of course not tell

7642
02:12:22,950 --> 02:12:22,960
tell people lies of course not tell
 

7643
02:12:22,960 --> 02:12:26,390
tell people lies of course not tell
people accurately what the risk is

7644
02:12:26,390 --> 02:12:26,400
people accurately what the risk is
 

7645
02:12:26,400 --> 02:12:28,870
people accurately what the risk is
give people tools that have evidence

7646
02:12:28,870 --> 02:12:28,880
give people tools that have evidence
 

7647
02:12:28,880 --> 02:12:31,750
give people tools that have evidence
that they can address their risk with

7648
02:12:31,750 --> 02:12:31,760
that they can address their risk with
 

7649
02:12:31,760 --> 02:12:32,830
that they can address their risk with
um

7650
02:12:32,830 --> 02:12:32,840
um
 

7651
02:12:32,840 --> 02:12:36,069
um
and level with people when we don't know

7652
02:12:36,069 --> 02:12:36,079
and level with people when we don't know
 

7653
02:12:36,079 --> 02:12:38,629
and level with people when we don't know
i think that is the right adult way for

7654
02:12:38,629 --> 02:12:38,639
i think that is the right adult way for
 

7655
02:12:38,639 --> 02:12:40,310
i think that is the right adult way for
to deal with this pandemic from public

7656
02:12:40,310 --> 02:12:40,320
to deal with this pandemic from public
 

7657
02:12:40,320 --> 02:12:42,550
to deal with this pandemic from public
health point of view and that's that is

7658
02:12:42,550 --> 02:12:42,560
health point of view and that's that is
 

7659
02:12:42,560 --> 02:12:45,270
health point of view and that's that is
not the policy we have followed instead

7660
02:12:45,270 --> 02:12:45,280
not the policy we have followed instead
 

7661
02:12:45,280 --> 02:12:46,950
not the policy we have followed instead
public health has intentionally stoked

7662
02:12:46,950 --> 02:12:46,960
public health has intentionally stoked
 

7663
02:12:46,960 --> 02:12:48,870
public health has intentionally stoked
the fear in order to gain compliance

7664
02:12:48,870 --> 02:12:48,880
the fear in order to gain compliance
 

7665
02:12:48,880 --> 02:12:50,390
the fear in order to gain compliance
with his edicts

7666
02:12:50,390 --> 02:12:50,400
with his edicts
 

7667
02:12:50,400 --> 02:12:53,910
with his edicts
and i think the consequence of that is

7668
02:12:53,910 --> 02:12:53,920
and i think the consequence of that is
 

7669
02:12:53,920 --> 02:12:56,470
and i think the consequence of that is
people distrust public health

7670
02:12:56,470 --> 02:12:56,480
people distrust public health
 

7671
02:12:56,480 --> 02:12:57,830
people distrust public health
what you're talking about the distrust

7672
02:12:57,830 --> 02:12:57,840
what you're talking about the distrust
 

7673
02:12:57,840 --> 02:12:59,430
what you're talking about the distrust
of government i think is a partly a

7674
02:12:59,430 --> 02:12:59,440
of government i think is a partly a
 

7675
02:12:59,440 --> 02:13:01,270
of government i think is a partly a
consequence of that that that movement

7676
02:13:01,270 --> 02:13:01,280
consequence of that that that movement
 

7677
02:13:01,280 --> 02:13:03,270
consequence of that that that movement
which is much smaller once upon a time

7678
02:13:03,270 --> 02:13:03,280
which is much smaller once upon a time
 

7679
02:13:03,280 --> 02:13:04,950
which is much smaller once upon a time
is much larger now

7680
02:13:04,950 --> 02:13:04,960
is much larger now
 

7681
02:13:04,960 --> 02:13:07,430
is much larger now
because of essentially people look at

7682
02:13:07,430 --> 02:13:07,440
because of essentially people look at
 

7683
02:13:07,440 --> 02:13:09,109
because of essentially people look at
what the what public health has done and

7684
02:13:09,109 --> 02:13:09,119
what the what public health has done and
 

7685
02:13:09,119 --> 02:13:11,510
what the what public health has done and
said i mean they've lied to me a whole

7686
02:13:11,510 --> 02:13:11,520
said i mean they've lied to me a whole
 

7687
02:13:11,520 --> 02:13:13,430
said i mean they've lied to me a whole
bunch of times a whole bunch of things

7688
02:13:13,430 --> 02:13:13,440
bunch of times a whole bunch of things
 

7689
02:13:13,440 --> 02:13:15,510
bunch of times a whole bunch of things
is the general sense and there are

is the general sense and there are
consequences of that

7692
02:13:17,109 --> 02:13:17,119
consequences of that
 

7693
02:13:17,119 --> 02:13:18,470
consequences of that
we're going to have to work in public

7694
02:13:18,470 --> 02:13:18,480
we're going to have to work in public
 

7695
02:13:18,480 --> 02:13:20,709
we're going to have to work in public
health for a long time to try to regain
