so when you when you build a computer

234
00:05:05,480 --> 00:05:05,490
so when you when you build a computer
 

235
00:05:05,490 --> 00:05:07,800
so when you when you build a computer
you know first there's a target like

236
00:05:07,800 --> 00:05:07,810
you know first there's a target like
 

237
00:05:07,810 --> 00:05:09,570
you know first there's a target like
what's it for look how fast does it have

238
00:05:09,570 --> 00:05:09,580
what's it for look how fast does it have
 

239
00:05:09,580 --> 00:05:11,309
what's it for look how fast does it have
to be which you know today there's a

240
00:05:11,309 --> 00:05:11,319
to be which you know today there's a
 

241
00:05:11,319 --> 00:05:12,779
to be which you know today there's a
whole bunch of metrics about what that

242
00:05:12,779 --> 00:05:12,789
whole bunch of metrics about what that
 

243
00:05:12,789 --> 00:05:16,140
whole bunch of metrics about what that
is and then in an organization of you

244
00:05:16,140 --> 00:05:16,150
is and then in an organization of you
 

245
00:05:16,150 --> 00:05:17,490
is and then in an organization of you
know a thousand people who build a

246
00:05:17,490 --> 00:05:17,500
know a thousand people who build a
 

247
00:05:17,500 --> 00:05:20,520
know a thousand people who build a
computer there's lots of different

248
00:05:20,520 --> 00:05:20,530
computer there's lots of different
 

249
00:05:20,530 --> 00:05:23,550
computer there's lots of different
disciplines that you have to operate on

250
00:05:23,550 --> 00:05:23,560
disciplines that you have to operate on
 

251
00:05:23,560 --> 00:05:27,540
disciplines that you have to operate on
does that make sense and so so there's a

252
00:05:27,540 --> 00:05:27,550
does that make sense and so so there's a
 

253
00:05:27,550 --> 00:05:31,469
does that make sense and so so there's a
bunch of levels abstraction of in in

254
00:05:31,469 --> 00:05:31,479
bunch of levels abstraction of in in
 

255
00:05:31,479 --> 00:05:33,990
bunch of levels abstraction of in in
organizational I can tell and in your

00:07:00,640 --> 00:07:04,890
is you fetch large numbers of
instructions say 500 and then you find

322
00:07:04,890 --> 00:07:04,900
instructions say 500 and then you find
 

323
00:07:04,900 --> 00:07:06,630
instructions say 500 and then you find
the dependency graph between the

324
00:07:06,630 --> 00:07:06,640
the dependency graph between the
 

325
00:07:06,640 --> 00:07:10,290
the dependency graph between the
instructions and then you you execute in

326
00:07:10,290 --> 00:07:10,300
instructions and then you you execute in
 

327
00:07:10,300 --> 00:07:13,260
instructions and then you you execute in
independent units those little micro

328
00:07:13,260 --> 00:07:13,270
independent units those little micro
 

329
00:07:13,270 --> 00:07:17,190
independent units those little micro
graphs so a modern computer like people

330
00:07:17,190 --> 00:07:17,200
graphs so a modern computer like people
 

331
00:07:17,200 --> 00:07:18,960
graphs so a modern computer like people
like to say computers should be simple

332
00:07:18,960 --> 00:07:18,970
like to say computers should be simple
 

333
00:07:18,970 --> 00:07:21,750
like to say computers should be simple
and clean but it turns out the market

334
00:07:21,750 --> 00:07:21,760
and clean but it turns out the market
 

335
00:07:21,760 --> 00:07:23,550
and clean but it turns out the market
for a simple complete clean slow

336
00:07:23,550 --> 00:07:23,560
for a simple complete clean slow
 

337
00:07:23,560 --> 00:07:26,820
for a simple complete clean slow
computers is zero right we don't sell

338
00:07:26,820 --> 00:07:26,830
computers is zero right we don't sell
 

339
00:07:26,830 --> 00:07:30,030
computers is zero right we don't sell
any simple clean computers now you can

340
00:07:30,030 --> 00:07:30,040
any simple clean computers now you can
 

341
00:07:30,040 --> 00:07:33,090
any simple clean computers now you can
there's how you build it can be clean

342
00:07:33,090 --> 00:07:33,100
there's how you build it can be clean
 

343
00:07:33,100 --> 00:07:35,840
there's how you build it can be clean
but the computer people want to buy

344
00:07:35,840 --> 00:07:35,850
but the computer people want to buy
 

345
00:07:35,850 --> 00:07:39,590
but the computer people want to buy
that's say you know phone or data center

346
00:07:39,590 --> 00:07:39,600
that's say you know phone or data center
 

347
00:07:39,600 --> 00:07:42,270
that's say you know phone or data center
such as a large number of instructions

348
00:07:42,270 --> 00:07:42,280
such as a large number of instructions
 

349
00:07:42,280 --> 00:07:45,900
such as a large number of instructions
computes the dependency graph and then

350
00:07:45,900 --> 00:07:45,910
computes the dependency graph and then
 

351
00:07:45,910 --> 00:07:48,000
computes the dependency graph and then
executes it in a way that gets the right

352
00:07:48,000 --> 00:07:48,010
executes it in a way that gets the right
 

353
00:07:48,010 --> 00:07:50,670
executes it in a way that gets the right
answers and optimizes that graph somehow

354
00:07:50,670 --> 00:07:50,680
answers and optimizes that graph somehow
 

355
00:07:50,680 --> 00:07:53,490
answers and optimizes that graph somehow
yeah they run deeply out of order and

356
00:07:53,490 --> 00:07:53,500
yeah they run deeply out of order and
 

357
00:07:53,500 --> 00:07:56,310
yeah they run deeply out of order and
then there's semantics around how memory

358
00:07:56,310 --> 00:07:56,320
then there's semantics around how memory
 

359
00:07:56,320 --> 00:07:58,470
then there's semantics around how memory
ordering works and other things work so

360
00:07:58,470 --> 00:07:58,480
ordering works and other things work so
 

361
00:07:58,480 --> 00:08:00,810
ordering works and other things work so
the the computer sort of has a bunch of

362
00:08:00,810 --> 00:08:00,820
the the computer sort of has a bunch of
 

363
00:08:00,820 --> 00:08:02,940
the the computer sort of has a bunch of
bookkeeping tables it says what order

364
00:08:02,940 --> 00:08:02,950
bookkeeping tables it says what order
 

365
00:08:02,950 --> 00:08:06,120
bookkeeping tables it says what order
CDs operations finishing or appear to

366
00:08:06,120 --> 00:08:06,130
CDs operations finishing or appear to
 

367
00:08:06,130 --> 00:08:09,240
CDs operations finishing or appear to
finish him but to go fast you have to

368
00:08:09,240 --> 00:08:09,250
finish him but to go fast you have to
 

369
00:08:09,250 --> 00:08:11,190
finish him but to go fast you have to
fetch a lot of instructions and find all

370
00:08:11,190 --> 00:08:11,200
fetch a lot of instructions and find all
 

371
00:08:11,200 --> 00:08:13,440
fetch a lot of instructions and find all
the parallelism now there's a second

372
00:08:13,440 --> 00:08:13,450
the parallelism now there's a second
 

373
00:08:13,450 --> 00:08:16,380
the parallelism now there's a second
kind of computer which we call GPUs

374
00:08:16,380 --> 00:08:16,390
kind of computer which we call GPUs
 

375
00:08:16,390 --> 00:08:19,020
kind of computer which we call GPUs
today and I called the difference

376
00:08:19,020 --> 00:08:19,030
today and I called the difference
 

377
00:08:19,030 --> 00:08:21,300
today and I called the difference
there's found parallelism like you have

378
00:08:21,300 --> 00:08:21,310
there's found parallelism like you have
 

379
00:08:21,310 --> 00:08:22,830
there's found parallelism like you have
a program with a lot of dependent

380
00:08:22,830 --> 00:08:22,840
a program with a lot of dependent
 

381
00:08:22,840 --> 00:08:25,200
a program with a lot of dependent
instructions you fetch a bunch and then

382
00:08:25,200 --> 00:08:25,210
instructions you fetch a bunch and then
 

383
00:08:25,210 --> 00:08:26,880
instructions you fetch a bunch and then
you go figure out the dependency graph

384
00:08:26,880 --> 00:08:26,890
you go figure out the dependency graph
 

385
00:08:26,890 --> 00:08:28,680
you go figure out the dependency graph
and you issues instructions out order

386
00:08:28,680 --> 00:08:28,690
and you issues instructions out order
 

387
00:08:28,690 --> 00:08:31,140
and you issues instructions out order
that's because you have one serial

388
00:08:31,140 --> 00:08:31,150
that's because you have one serial
 

389
00:08:31,150 --> 00:08:33,750
that's because you have one serial
narrative to execute which in fact is

390
00:08:33,750 --> 00:08:33,760
narrative to execute which in fact is
 

391
00:08:33,760 --> 00:08:36,240
narrative to execute which in fact is
and can be done out of order you call a

392
00:08:36,240 --> 00:08:36,250
and can be done out of order you call a
 

393
00:08:36,250 --> 00:08:39,540
and can be done out of order you call a
narrative yeah well so yeah so humans

394
00:08:39,540 --> 00:08:39,550
narrative yeah well so yeah so humans
 

395
00:08:39,550 --> 00:08:41,339
narrative yeah well so yeah so humans
think of serial narrative so read read a

396
00:08:41,339 --> 00:08:41,349
think of serial narrative so read read a
 

397
00:08:41,349 --> 00:08:43,680
think of serial narrative so read read a
book right there's a you know there's

398
00:08:43,680 --> 00:08:43,690
book right there's a you know there's
 

399
00:08:43,690 --> 00:08:45,270
book right there's a you know there's
the sends after sentence after sentence

400
00:08:45,270 --> 00:08:45,280
the sends after sentence after sentence
 

401
00:08:45,280 --> 00:08:46,680
the sends after sentence after sentence
and there's paragraphs

402
00:08:46,680 --> 00:08:46,690
and there's paragraphs
 

403
00:08:46,690 --> 00:08:48,720
and there's paragraphs
now you could diagram that

404
00:08:48,720 --> 00:08:48,730
now you could diagram that
 

405
00:08:48,730 --> 00:08:51,100
now you could diagram that
imagine you diagrammed it properly and

406
00:08:51,100 --> 00:08:51,110
imagine you diagrammed it properly and
 

407
00:08:51,110 --> 00:08:54,280
imagine you diagrammed it properly and
you said which sentences could be read

408
00:08:54,280 --> 00:08:54,290
you said which sentences could be read
 

409
00:08:54,290 --> 00:08:56,920
you said which sentences could be read
in anti order any order without changing

410
00:08:56,920 --> 00:08:56,930
in anti order any order without changing
 

411
00:08:56,930 --> 00:09:00,220
in anti order any order without changing
the meaning right but that's a

412
00:09:00,220 --> 00:09:00,230
the meaning right but that's a
 

413
00:09:00,230 --> 00:09:01,930
the meaning right but that's a
fascinating question to ask of a book

414
00:09:01,930 --> 00:09:01,940
fascinating question to ask of a book
 

415
00:09:01,940 --> 00:09:04,540
fascinating question to ask of a book
yeah yeah you could do that right so

416
00:09:04,540 --> 00:09:04,550
yeah yeah you could do that right so
 

417
00:09:04,550 --> 00:09:06,430
yeah yeah you could do that right so
some paragraphs could be reordered some

418
00:09:06,430 --> 00:09:06,440
some paragraphs could be reordered some
 

419
00:09:06,440 --> 00:09:09,180
some paragraphs could be reordered some
sentences can be reordered you could say

420
00:09:09,180 --> 00:09:09,190
sentences can be reordered you could say
 

421
00:09:09,190 --> 00:09:16,000
sentences can be reordered you could say
he is tall and smart and X right and it

422
00:09:16,000 --> 00:09:16,010
he is tall and smart and X right and it
 

423
00:09:16,010 --> 00:09:17,650
he is tall and smart and X right and it
doesn't matter the order of tall and

424
00:09:17,650 --> 00:09:17,660
doesn't matter the order of tall and
 

425
00:09:17,660 --> 00:09:20,980
doesn't matter the order of tall and
smart but if you say is that tall man

426
00:09:20,980 --> 00:09:20,990
smart but if you say is that tall man
 

427
00:09:20,990 --> 00:09:23,470
smart but if you say is that tall man
who's wearing a red shirt what colors

428
00:09:23,470 --> 00:09:23,480
who's wearing a red shirt what colors
 

429
00:09:23,480 --> 00:09:25,920
who's wearing a red shirt what colors
you know like you can create

430
00:09:25,920 --> 00:09:25,930
you know like you can create
 

431
00:09:25,930 --> 00:09:30,940
you know like you can create
dependencies right right and so GPUs on

432
00:09:30,940 --> 00:09:30,950
dependencies right right and so GPUs on
 

433
00:09:30,950 --> 00:09:33,610
dependencies right right and so GPUs on
the other hand run simple programs on

434
00:09:33,610 --> 00:09:33,620
the other hand run simple programs on
 

435
00:09:33,620 --> 00:09:36,490
the other hand run simple programs on
pixels but you're given a million of

436
00:09:36,490 --> 00:09:36,500
pixels but you're given a million of
 

437
00:09:36,500 --> 00:09:39,550
pixels but you're given a million of
them and the first order the screen

438
00:09:39,550 --> 00:09:39,560
them and the first order the screen
 

439
00:09:39,560 --> 00:09:40,780
them and the first order the screen
you're looking at it doesn't care which

440
00:09:40,780 --> 00:09:40,790
you're looking at it doesn't care which
 

441
00:09:40,790 --> 00:09:43,329
you're looking at it doesn't care which
order you do it in so I call that given

442
00:09:43,329 --> 00:09:43,339
order you do it in so I call that given
 

443
00:09:43,339 --> 00:09:46,000
order you do it in so I call that given
parallelism simple narratives around the

444
00:09:46,000 --> 00:09:46,010
parallelism simple narratives around the
 

445
00:09:46,010 --> 00:09:48,880
parallelism simple narratives around the
large numbers of things where you can

446
00:09:48,880 --> 00:09:48,890
large numbers of things where you can
 

447
00:09:48,890 --> 00:09:51,340
large numbers of things where you can
just say it's parallel because you told

448
00:09:51,340 --> 00:09:51,350
just say it's parallel because you told
 

449
00:09:51,350 --> 00:09:55,360
just say it's parallel because you told
me it was so found parallelism where the

450
00:09:55,360 --> 00:09:55,370
me it was so found parallelism where the
 

451
00:09:55,370 --> 00:09:57,970
me it was so found parallelism where the
narrative is it's sequential but you

452
00:09:57,970 --> 00:09:57,980
narrative is it's sequential but you
 

453
00:09:57,980 --> 00:10:00,310
narrative is it's sequential but you
discover like little pockets of

454
00:10:00,310 --> 00:10:00,320
discover like little pockets of
 

455
00:10:00,320 --> 00:10:02,350
discover like little pockets of
parallelism of versus turns out large

456
00:10:02,350 --> 00:10:02,360
parallelism of versus turns out large
 

457
00:10:02,360 --> 00:10:04,960
parallelism of versus turns out large
pockets of parallelism large so how hard

458
00:10:04,960 --> 00:10:04,970
pockets of parallelism large so how hard
 

459
00:10:04,970 --> 00:10:06,880
pockets of parallelism large so how hard
is it to discuss well how hard is it

460
00:10:06,880 --> 00:10:06,890
is it to discuss well how hard is it
 

461
00:10:06,890 --> 00:10:08,949
is it to discuss well how hard is it
that's just transistor count right so

462
00:10:08,949 --> 00:10:08,959
that's just transistor count right so
 

463
00:10:08,959 --> 00:10:10,540
that's just transistor count right so
once you crack the problem you say

464
00:10:10,540 --> 00:10:10,550
once you crack the problem you say
 

465
00:10:10,550 --> 00:10:12,940
once you crack the problem you say
here's how you fetch ten instructions at

466
00:10:12,940 --> 00:10:12,950
here's how you fetch ten instructions at
 

467
00:10:12,950 --> 00:10:14,800
here's how you fetch ten instructions at
a time here's how you calculated the

468
00:10:14,800 --> 00:10:14,810
a time here's how you calculated the
 

469
00:10:14,810 --> 00:10:16,780
a time here's how you calculated the
dependencies between them here's how you

470
00:10:16,780 --> 00:10:16,790
dependencies between them here's how you
 

471
00:10:16,790 --> 00:10:18,880
dependencies between them here's how you
describe the dependencies here's you

472
00:10:18,880 --> 00:10:18,890
describe the dependencies here's you
 

473
00:10:18,890 --> 00:10:23,290
describe the dependencies here's you
know these are pieces right so once you

474
00:10:23,290 --> 00:10:23,300
know these are pieces right so once you
 

475
00:10:23,300 --> 00:10:26,079
know these are pieces right so once you
describe the dependencies then it's just

476
00:10:26,079 --> 00:10:26,089
describe the dependencies then it's just
 

477
00:10:26,089 --> 00:10:29,050
describe the dependencies then it's just
a graph sort of it's an algorithm that

478
00:10:29,050 --> 00:10:29,060
a graph sort of it's an algorithm that
 

479
00:10:29,060 --> 00:10:32,440

every time you look at the branch you
 

567
00:12:22,650 --> 00:12:24,940
every time you look at the branch you
say it's probably still greater than one

00:12:27,110 --> 00:12:29,540
he's saying you could do that accurately
very accurately monitoring comes my mind

yes you simply recorded which way the

582
00:12:39,230 --> 00:12:39,240
yes you simply recorded which way the
 

583
00:12:39,240 --> 00:12:41,450
yes you simply recorded which way the
branch went last time and predicted the

584
00:12:41,450 --> 00:12:41,460
branch went last time and predicted the
 

585
00:12:41,460 --> 00:12:44,690
branch went last time and predicted the
same thing right okay what's the

586
00:12:44,690 --> 00:12:44,700
same thing right okay what's the
 

587
00:12:44,700 --> 00:12:48,740
same thing right okay what's the
accuracy of that 85% so then somebody

588
00:12:48,740 --> 00:12:48,750
accuracy of that 85% so then somebody
 

589
00:12:48,750 --> 00:12:51,280
accuracy of that 85% so then somebody
said hey let's keep a couple of bits and

590
00:12:51,280 --> 00:12:51,290
said hey let's keep a couple of bits and
 

591
00:12:51,290 --> 00:12:53,840
said hey let's keep a couple of bits and
have a little counter so and it predicts

592
00:12:53,840 --> 00:12:53,850
have a little counter so and it predicts
 

593
00:12:53,850 --> 00:12:57,170
have a little counter so and it predicts
one way we count up and then pins so say

594
00:12:57,170 --> 00:12:57,180
one way we count up and then pins so say
 

595
00:12:57,180 --> 00:12:58,220
one way we count up and then pins so say
you have a three bit counter so you

596
00:12:58,220 --> 00:12:58,230
you have a three bit counter so you
 

597
00:12:58,230 --> 00:13:01,160
you have a three bit counter so you
count up and then count down and if it's

598
00:13:01,160 --> 00:13:01,170
count up and then count down and if it's
 

599
00:13:01,170 --> 00:13:02,780
count up and then count down and if it's
you know you can use the top bit as the

600
00:13:02,780 --> 00:13:02,790
you know you can use the top bit as the
 

601
00:13:02,790 --> 00:13:04,610
you know you can use the top bit as the
sign bit so you have a sign to bit

602
00:13:04,610 --> 00:13:04,620
sign bit so you have a sign to bit
 

603
00:13:04,620 --> 00:13:06,470
sign bit so you have a sign to bit
number so if it's greater than one you

604
00:13:06,470 --> 00:13:06,480
number so if it's greater than one you
 

605
00:13:06,480 --> 00:13:09,530
number so if it's greater than one you
predict taken and lesson one you predict

606
00:13:09,530 --> 00:13:09,540
predict taken and lesson one you predict
 

607
00:13:09,540 --> 00:13:10,160
predict taken and lesson one you predict
not-taken

608
00:13:10,160 --> 00:13:10,170
not-taken
 

609
00:13:10,170 --> 00:13:12,530
not-taken
right or less than zero or whatever the

610
00:13:12,530 --> 00:13:12,540
right or less than zero or whatever the
 

611
00:13:12,540 --> 00:13:13,580
right or less than zero or whatever the
thing is

612
00:13:13,580 --> 00:13:13,590
thing is
 

613
00:13:13,590 --> 00:13:17,990
thing is
and that got us to 92% oh okay I know is

614
00:13:17,990 --> 00:13:18,000
and that got us to 92% oh okay I know is
 

615
00:13:18,000 --> 00:13:18,700
and that got us to 92% oh okay I know is
this better

616
00:13:18,700 --> 00:13:18,710
this better
 

617
00:13:18,710 --> 00:13:22,430
this better
this branch depends on how you got there

618
00:13:22,430 --> 00:13:22,440
this branch depends on how you got there
 

619
00:13:22,440 --> 00:13:24,640
this branch depends on how you got there
so if you came down the code one way

620
00:13:24,640 --> 00:13:24,650
so if you came down the code one way
 

621
00:13:24,650 --> 00:13:28,250
so if you came down the code one way
you're talking about Bob and Jane right

622
00:13:28,250 --> 00:13:28,260
you're talking about Bob and Jane right
 

623
00:13:28,260 --> 00:13:30,320
you're talking about Bob and Jane right
and then said is just Bob like Jane

624
00:13:30,320 --> 00:13:30,330
and then said is just Bob like Jane
 

625
00:13:30,330 --> 00:13:31,579
and then said is just Bob like Jane
Enoch went one way but if you're talking

626
00:13:31,579 --> 00:13:31,589
Enoch went one way but if you're talking
 

627
00:13:31,589 --> 00:13:33,920
Enoch went one way but if you're talking
about Bob and Jill this Bob like changes

628
00:13:33,920 --> 00:13:33,930
about Bob and Jill this Bob like changes
 

629
00:13:33,930 --> 00:13:34,730
about Bob and Jill this Bob like changes
you go a different way

630
00:13:34,730 --> 00:13:34,740
you go a different way
 

631
00:13:34,740 --> 00:13:37,130
you go a different way
right so that's called history so you

632
00:13:37,130 --> 00:13:37,140
right so that's called history so you
 

633
00:13:37,140 --> 00:13:40,130
right so that's called history so you
take the history and a counter that's

634
00:13:40,130 --> 00:13:40,140
take the history and a counter that's
 

635
00:13:40,140 --> 00:13:42,290
take the history and a counter that's
cool but that's not how anything works

636
00:13:42,290 --> 00:13:42,300
cool but that's not how anything works
 

637
00:13:42,300 --> 00:13:44,720
cool but that's not how anything works
today they use something that looks a

638
00:13:44,720 --> 00:13:44,730
today they use something that looks a
 

639
00:13:44,730 --> 00:13:48,500
today they use something that looks a
little like a neural network so modern

640
00:13:48,500 --> 00:13:48,510
little like a neural network so modern
 

641
00:13:48,510 --> 00:13:51,610
little like a neural network so modern
you take all the execution flows and

642
00:13:51,610 --> 00:13:51,620
you take all the execution flows and
 

643
00:13:51,620 --> 00:13:55,160
you take all the execution flows and
then you do basically deep pattern

644
00:13:55,160 --> 00:13:55,170
then you do basically deep pattern
 

645
00:13:55,170 --> 00:13:57,650
then you do basically deep pattern
recognition of how the program is

646
00:13:57,650 --> 00:13:57,660
recognition of how the program is
 

647
00:13:57,660 --> 00:14:02,060
recognition of how the program is
executing and you do that multiple

648
00:14:02,060 --> 00:14:02,070
executing and you do that multiple
 

649
00:14:02,070 --> 00:14:04,490
executing and you do that multiple
different ways and you have something

650
00:14:04,490 --> 00:14:04,500
different ways and you have something
 

651
00:14:04,500 --> 00:14:06,730
different ways and you have something
that chooses what the best result is

652
00:14:06,730 --> 00:14:06,740
that chooses what the best result is
 

653
00:14:06,740 --> 00:14:09,560
that chooses what the best result is
there's a little supercomputer inside

654
00:14:09,560 --> 00:14:09,570
there's a little supercomputer inside
 

655
00:14:09,570 --> 00:14:11,360
there's a little supercomputer inside
the computer that's trying to project

656
00:14:11,360 --> 00:14:11,370
the computer that's trying to project
 

657
00:14:11,370 --> 00:14:14,450
the computer that's trying to project
that calculates which way branches go so

658
00:14:14,450 --> 00:14:14,460
that calculates which way branches go so
 

659
00:14:14,460 --> 00:14:16,280
that calculates which way branches go so
the effective window that it's worth

660
00:14:16,280 --> 00:14:16,290
the effective window that it's worth
 

661
00:14:16,290 --> 00:14:19,730
the effective window that it's worth
finding grassing gets bigger why was

662
00:14:19,730 --> 00:14:19,740
finding grassing gets bigger why was
 

663
00:14:19,740 --> 00:14:22,760
finding grassing gets bigger why was
that gonna make me sad that's amazing

664
00:14:22,760 --> 00:14:22,770
that gonna make me sad that's amazing
 

665
00:14:22,770 --> 00:14:25,340
that gonna make me sad that's amazing
it's amazingly complicated oh well

666
00:14:25,340 --> 00:14:25,350
it's amazingly complicated oh well
 

667
00:14:25,350 --> 00:14:28,990
it's amazingly complicated oh well
here's the funny thing so to get to 85%

668
00:14:28,990 --> 00:14:29,000
here's the funny thing so to get to 85%
 

669
00:14:29,000 --> 00:14:35,470
here's the funny thing so to get to 85%
took a thousand bits to get to 99% takes

670
00:14:35,470 --> 00:14:35,480
took a thousand bits to get to 99% takes
 

671
00:14:35,480 --> 00:14:37,990
took a thousand bits to get to 99% takes
tens of megabits

672
00:14:37,990 --> 00:14:38,000
tens of megabits
 

673
00:14:38,000 --> 00:14:41,540
tens of megabits
so this is one of those to get the

674
00:14:41,540 --> 00:14:41,550
so this is one of those to get the
 

675
00:14:41,550 --> 00:14:43,460
so this is one of those to get the
result you want you know to get from a

676
00:14:43,460 --> 00:14:43,470
result you want you know to get from a
 

677
00:14:43,470 --> 00:14:47,840
result you want you know to get from a
window of say 50 instructions to 500 it

678
00:14:47,840 --> 00:14:47,850
window of say 50 instructions to 500 it
 

679
00:14:47,850 --> 00:14:49,790
window of say 50 instructions to 500 it
took three orders of magnitudes or four

680
00:14:49,790 --> 00:14:49,800
took three orders of magnitudes or four
 

681
00:14:49,800 --> 00:14:53,000
took three orders of magnitudes or four
orders of magnitude toward bits now if

682
00:14:53,000 --> 00:14:53,010
orders of magnitude toward bits now if
 

683
00:14:53,010 --> 00:14:54,590
orders of magnitude toward bits now if
you get the prediction of a branch wrong

684
00:14:54,590 --> 00:14:54,600
you get the prediction of a branch wrong
 

685
00:14:54,600 --> 00:14:57,410
you get the prediction of a branch wrong
what happens then what is the pipe you

686
00:14:57,410 --> 00:14:57,420
what happens then what is the pipe you
 

687
00:14:57,420 --> 00:14:58,910
what happens then what is the pipe you
flush the pipes is just the performance

688
00:14:58,910 --> 00:14:58,920
flush the pipes is just the performance
 

689
00:14:58,920 --> 00:15:01,579
flush the pipes is just the performance
cost but it gets even better yeah so

690
00:15:01,579 --> 00:15:01,589
cost but it gets even better yeah so
 

691
00:15:01,589 --> 00:15:02,930
cost but it gets even better yeah so
we're starting to look at stuff that

692
00:15:02,930 --> 00:15:02,940
we're starting to look at stuff that
 

693
00:15:02,940 --> 00:15:07,010
we're starting to look at stuff that
says so executed down this path and then

694
00:15:07,010 --> 00:15:07,020
says so executed down this path and then
 

695
00:15:07,020 --> 00:15:11,030
says so executed down this path and then
you had two ways to go but far far away

696
00:15:11,030 --> 00:15:11,040
you had two ways to go but far far away
 

697
00:15:11,040 --> 00:15:12,380
you had two ways to go but far far away
there's something that doesn't matter

698
00:15:12,380 --> 00:15:12,390
there's something that doesn't matter
 

699
00:15:12,390 --> 00:15:16,670
there's something that doesn't matter
which path you went so you miss you took

700
00:15:16,670 --> 00:15:16,680
which path you went so you miss you took
 

701
00:15:16,680 --> 00:15:18,650
which path you went so you miss you took
the wrong path you executed a bunch of

702
00:15:18,650 --> 00:15:18,660
the wrong path you executed a bunch of
 

703
00:15:18,660 --> 00:15:21,680
the wrong path you executed a bunch of
stuff then you had to miss predicting

704
00:15:21,680 --> 00:15:21,690
stuff then you had to miss predicting
 

705
00:15:21,690 --> 00:15:23,240
stuff then you had to miss predicting
too backed it up but you remembered all

706
00:15:23,240 --> 00:15:23,250
too backed it up but you remembered all
 

707
00:15:23,250 --> 00:15:25,760
too backed it up but you remembered all
the results you already calculated some

708
00:15:25,760 --> 00:15:25,770
the results you already calculated some
 

709
00:15:25,770 --> 00:15:27,380
the results you already calculated some
of those are just fine

710
00:15:27,380 --> 00:15:27,390
of those are just fine
 

711
00:15:27,390 --> 00:15:28,880
of those are just fine
look if you read a book and you

712
00:15:28,880 --> 00:15:28,890
look if you read a book and you
 

713
00:15:28,890 --> 00:15:30,380
look if you read a book and you
misunderstand the paragraph your

714
00:15:30,380 --> 00:15:30,390
misunderstand the paragraph your
 

715
00:15:30,390 --> 00:15:31,990
misunderstand the paragraph your
understanding is the next paragraph

716
00:15:31,990 --> 00:15:32,000
understanding is the next paragraph
 

717
00:15:32,000 --> 00:15:34,190
understanding is the next paragraph
sometimes is invariance I don't

718
00:15:34,190 --> 00:15:34,200
sometimes is invariance I don't
 

719
00:15:34,200 --> 00:15:37,160
sometimes is invariance I don't
understand you sometimes it depends on

720
00:15:37,160 --> 00:15:37,170
understand you sometimes it depends on
 

721
00:15:37,170 --> 00:15:41,350
understand you sometimes it depends on
it and you can kind of anticipate that

722
00:15:41,350 --> 00:15:41,360
it and you can kind of anticipate that
 

723
00:15:41,360 --> 00:15:45,440
it and you can kind of anticipate that
invariance yeah well you can keep track

724
00:15:45,440 --> 00:15:45,450
invariance yeah well you can keep track
 

725
00:15:45,450 --> 00:15:47,810
invariance yeah well you can keep track
of whether that data changed and so when

726
00:15:47,810 --> 00:15:47,820
of whether that data changed and so when
 

727
00:15:47,820 --> 00:15:49,370
of whether that data changed and so when
you come back to a piece of code should

728
00:15:49,370 --> 00:15:49,380
you come back to a piece of code should
 

729
00:15:49,380 --> 00:15:50,720
you come back to a piece of code should
you calculate it again or do the same

730
00:15:50,720 --> 00:15:50,730
you calculate it again or do the same
 

731
00:15:50,730 --> 00:15:53,389
you calculate it again or do the same
thing okay how much does this is art and

732
00:15:53,389 --> 00:15:53,399
thing okay how much does this is art and
 

733
00:15:53,399 --> 00:15:55,880
thing okay how much does this is art and
how much of it is science because it

734
00:15:55,880 --> 00:15:55,890
how much of it is science because it
 

735
00:15:55,890 --> 00:15:59,389
how much of it is science because it
sounds pretty complicated so well how do

736
00:15:59,389 --> 00:15:59,399
sounds pretty complicated so well how do
 

737
00:15:59,399 --> 00:16:01,220
sounds pretty complicated so well how do
you describe a situation so imagine you

738
00:16:01,220 --> 00:16:01,230
you describe a situation so imagine you
 

739
00:16:01,230 --> 00:16:02,930
you describe a situation so imagine you
come to a point in the road we have to

740
00:16:02,930 --> 00:16:02,940
come to a point in the road we have to
 

741
00:16:02,940 --> 00:16:05,480
come to a point in the road we have to
make a decision right and you have a

742
00:16:05,480 --> 00:16:05,490
make a decision right and you have a
 

743
00:16:05,490 --> 00:16:07,069
make a decision right and you have a
bunch of knowledge about which way to go

744
00:16:07,069 --> 00:16:07,079
bunch of knowledge about which way to go
 

745
00:16:07,079 --> 00:16:09,500
bunch of knowledge about which way to go
maybe you have a map so you want to go

746
00:16:09,500 --> 00:16:09,510
maybe you have a map so you want to go
 

747
00:16:09,510 --> 00:16:12,019
maybe you have a map so you want to go
is the shortest way or do you want to go

748
00:16:12,019 --> 00:16:12,029
is the shortest way or do you want to go
 

749
00:16:12,029 --> 00:16:13,850
is the shortest way or do you want to go
the fastest way or you want to take the

750
00:16:13,850 --> 00:16:13,860
the fastest way or you want to take the
 

751
00:16:13,860 --> 00:16:16,340
the fastest way or you want to take the
nicest Road so it's just some set of

752
00:16:16,340 --> 00:16:16,350
nicest Road so it's just some set of
 

753
00:16:16,350 --> 00:16:19,100
nicest Road so it's just some set of
data so imagine you're doing something

754
00:16:19,100 --> 00:16:19,110
data so imagine you're doing something
 

755
00:16:19,110 --> 00:16:20,920
data so imagine you're doing something
complicated like a building a computer

756
00:16:20,920 --> 00:16:20,930
complicated like a building a computer
 

757
00:16:20,930 --> 00:16:23,810
complicated like a building a computer
and there's hundreds of decision points

758
00:16:23,810 --> 00:16:23,820
and there's hundreds of decision points
 

759
00:16:23,820 --> 00:16:26,780
and there's hundreds of decision points
all with hundreds of possible ways to go

760
00:16:26,780 --> 00:16:26,790
all with hundreds of possible ways to go
 

761
00:16:26,790 --> 00:16:29,720
all with hundreds of possible ways to go
and the ways you pick interacts in a

762
00:16:29,720 --> 00:16:29,730
and the ways you pick interacts in a
 

763
00:16:29,730 --> 00:16:33,920
and the ways you pick interacts in a
complicated way right and then you have

764
00:16:33,920 --> 00:16:33,930
complicated way right and then you have
 

765
00:16:33,930 --> 00:16:36,139
complicated way right and then you have
to pick the right spot right so those

766
00:16:36,139 --> 00:16:36,149
to pick the right spot right so those
 

767
00:16:36,149 --> 00:16:38,240
to pick the right spot right so those
are there so I don't know yeah avoided

768
00:16:38,240 --> 00:16:38,250
are there so I don't know yeah avoided
 

769
00:16:38,250 --> 00:16:40,250
are there so I don't know yeah avoided
the question you just described do the

770
00:16:40,250 --> 00:16:40,260
the question you just described do the
 

771
00:16:40,260 --> 00:16:43,060
the question you just described do the
Robert Frost poem road less taken I

772
00:16:43,060 --> 00:16:43,070
Robert Frost poem road less taken I
 

773
00:16:43,070 --> 00:16:47,870
Robert Frost poem road less taken I
describe the Robin truss problem which

774
00:16:47,870 --> 00:16:47,880
describe the Robin truss problem which
 

775
00:16:47,880 --> 00:16:49,670
describe the Robin truss problem which
we do as computer designers it's all

776
00:16:49,670 --> 00:16:49,680
we do as computer designers it's all
 

777
00:16:49,680 --> 00:16:52,030
we do as computer designers it's all
poetry ok great

778
00:16:52,030 --> 00:16:52,040
poetry ok great
 

779
00:16:52,040 --> 00:16:53,930
poetry ok great
yeah I don't know how to describe that

780
00:16:53,930 --> 00:16:53,940
yeah I don't know how to describe that
 

781
00:16:53,940 --> 00:16:56,360
yeah I don't know how to describe that
because some people are very good at

782
00:16:56,360 --> 00:16:56,370
because some people are very good at
 

783
00:16:56,370 --> 00:16:58,280
because some people are very good at
making those intuitive leaps it seems

784
00:16:58,280 --> 00:16:58,290
making those intuitive leaps it seems
 

785
00:16:58,290 --> 00:17:00,829
making those intuitive leaps it seems
like the combinations of things some

786
00:17:00,829 --> 00:17:00,839
like the combinations of things some
 

787
00:17:00,839 --> 00:17:02,449
like the combinations of things some
people are less good at it but they're

788
00:17:02,449 --> 00:17:02,459
people are less good at it but they're
 

789
00:17:02,459 --> 00:17:04,280
people are less good at it but they're
really good at evaluating your

790
00:17:04,280 --> 00:17:04,290
really good at evaluating your
 

791
00:17:04,290 --> 00:17:06,829
really good at evaluating your
alternatives right and everybody has a

792
00:17:06,829 --> 00:17:06,839
alternatives right and everybody has a
 

793
00:17:06,839 --> 00:17:09,980
alternatives right and everybody has a
different way to do it and some people

794
00:17:09,980 --> 00:17:09,990
different way to do it and some people
 

795
00:17:09,990 --> 00:17:12,169
different way to do it and some people
can't make those sleeps but they're

796
00:17:12,169 --> 00:17:12,179
can't make those sleeps but they're
 

797
00:17:12,179 --> 00:17:14,659
can't make those sleeps but they're
really good at analyzing it so when you

798
00:17:14,659 --> 00:17:14,669
really good at analyzing it so when you
 

799
00:17:14,669 --> 00:17:16,520
really good at analyzing it so when you
see computers are designed by teams of

800
00:17:16,520 --> 00:17:16,530
see computers are designed by teams of
 

801
00:17:16,530 --> 00:17:17,809
see computers are designed by teams of
people who have very different skill

802
00:17:17,809 --> 00:17:17,819
people who have very different skill
 

803
00:17:17,819 --> 00:17:22,490
people who have very different skill
sets and a good team has lots of

804
00:17:22,490 --> 00:17:22,500
sets and a good team has lots of
 

805
00:17:22,500 --> 00:17:25,010
sets and a good team has lots of
different kinds of people and I suspect

806
00:17:25,010 --> 00:17:25,020
different kinds of people and I suspect
 

807
00:17:25,020 --> 00:17:26,329
different kinds of people and I suspect
you would describe some of them as

808
00:17:26,329 --> 00:17:26,339
you would describe some of them as
 

809
00:17:26,339 --> 00:17:30,010
you would describe some of them as
artistic right but not very many

810
00:17:30,010 --> 00:17:30,020
artistic right but not very many
 

811
00:17:30,020 --> 00:17:32,830
artistic right but not very many
unfortunately or fortunately fortunately

812
00:17:32,830 --> 00:17:32,840
unfortunately or fortunately fortunately
 

813
00:17:32,840 --> 00:17:36,560
unfortunately or fortunately fortunately
well you know computer science hard it's

814
00:17:36,560 --> 00:17:36,570
well you know computer science hard it's
 

815
00:17:36,570 --> 00:17:39,890
well you know computer science hard it's
99% perspiration

816
00:17:39,890 --> 00:17:39,900
99% perspiration
 

817
00:17:39,900 --> 00:17:42,560
99% perspiration
and the 1% inspiration is really

818
00:17:42,560 --> 00:17:42,570
and the 1% inspiration is really
 

819
00:17:42,570 --> 00:17:46,340
and the 1% inspiration is really
important but I need the 99 yeah you got

820
00:17:46,340 --> 00:17:46,350
important but I need the 99 yeah you got
 

821
00:17:46,350 --> 00:17:48,130
important but I need the 99 yeah you got
to do a lot of work and then there's

822
00:17:48,130 --> 00:17:48,140
to do a lot of work and then there's
 

823
00:17:48,140 --> 00:17:50,870
to do a lot of work and then there's
there are interesting things to do at

824
00:17:50,870 --> 00:17:50,880
there are interesting things to do at
 

825
00:17:50,880 --> 00:17:54,620
there are interesting things to do at
every level that stack so at the end of

826
00:17:54,620 --> 00:17:54,630
every level that stack so at the end of
 

827
00:17:54,630 --> 00:17:56,650
every level that stack so at the end of
the day if you're on the same program

828
00:17:56,650 --> 00:17:56,660
the day if you're on the same program
 

829
00:17:56,660 --> 00:17:59,780
the day if you're on the same program
multiple times does it always produce

830
00:17:59,780 --> 00:17:59,790
multiple times does it always produce
 

831
00:17:59,790 --> 00:18:03,049
multiple times does it always produce
the same result is is there some room

832
00:18:03,049 --> 00:18:03,059
the same result is is there some room
 

833
00:18:03,059 --> 00:18:05,180
the same result is is there some room
for fuzziness there that's a math

834
00:18:05,180 --> 00:18:05,190
for fuzziness there that's a math
 

835
00:18:05,190 --> 00:18:08,120
for fuzziness there that's a math
problem so if you run a correct C

836
00:18:08,120 --> 00:18:08,130
problem so if you run a correct C
 

837
00:18:08,130 --> 00:18:11,120
problem so if you run a correct C
program the definition is every time you

838
00:18:11,120 --> 00:18:11,130
program the definition is every time you
 

839
00:18:11,130 --> 00:18:12,860
program the definition is every time you
run it you get the same answer yeah that

840
00:18:12,860 --> 00:18:12,870
run it you get the same answer yeah that
 

841
00:18:12,870 --> 00:18:14,870
run it you get the same answer yeah that
well that's a math statement but that's

842
00:18:14,870 --> 00:18:14,880
well that's a math statement but that's
 

843
00:18:14,880 --> 00:18:16,520
well that's a math statement but that's
a that's a language definitional

844
00:18:16,520 --> 00:18:16,530
a that's a language definitional
 

845
00:18:16,530 --> 00:18:19,460
a that's a language definitional
statement so yes for years when people

846
00:18:19,460 --> 00:18:19,470
statement so yes for years when people
 

847
00:18:19,470 --> 00:18:22,040
statement so yes for years when people
did when we first did 3d acceleration of

848
00:18:22,040 --> 00:18:22,050
did when we first did 3d acceleration of
 

849
00:18:22,050 --> 00:18:26,240
did when we first did 3d acceleration of
graphics you could run the same scene

850
00:18:26,240 --> 00:18:26,250
graphics you could run the same scene
 

851
00:18:26,250 --> 00:18:28,220
graphics you could run the same scene
multiple times and get different answers

852
00:18:28,220 --> 00:18:28,230
multiple times and get different answers
 

853
00:18:28,230 --> 00:18:31,580
multiple times and get different answers
right right and then some people thought

854
00:18:31,580 --> 00:18:31,590
right right and then some people thought
 

855
00:18:31,590 --> 00:18:33,110
right right and then some people thought
that was okay and some people thought it

856
00:18:33,110 --> 00:18:33,120
that was okay and some people thought it
 

857
00:18:33,120 --> 00:18:36,290
that was okay and some people thought it
was a bad idea and then when the HPC

858
00:18:36,290 --> 00:18:36,300
was a bad idea and then when the HPC
 

859
00:18:36,300 --> 00:18:39,350
was a bad idea and then when the HPC
world used GPUs for calculations they

860
00:18:39,350 --> 00:18:39,360
world used GPUs for calculations they
 

861
00:18:39,360 --> 00:18:42,230
world used GPUs for calculations they
thought it's a really bad idea okay now

862
00:18:42,230 --> 00:18:42,240
thought it's a really bad idea okay now
 

863
00:18:42,240 --> 00:18:46,990
thought it's a really bad idea okay now
in modern AI stuff people are looking at

864
00:18:46,990 --> 00:18:47,000
in modern AI stuff people are looking at
 

865
00:18:47,000 --> 00:18:49,520
in modern AI stuff people are looking at
networks where the precision of the data

866
00:18:49,520 --> 00:18:49,530
networks where the precision of the data
 

867
00:18:49,530 --> 00:18:52,160
networks where the precision of the data
is low enough that the date has somewhat

868
00:18:52,160 --> 00:18:52,170
is low enough that the date has somewhat
 

869
00:18:52,170 --> 00:18:55,250
is low enough that the date has somewhat
noisy and the observation as the input

870
00:18:55,250 --> 00:18:55,260
noisy and the observation as the input
 

871
00:18:55,260 --> 00:18:57,919
noisy and the observation as the input
data is unbelievably noisy so why should

872
00:18:57,919 --> 00:18:57,929
data is unbelievably noisy so why should
 

873
00:18:57,929 --> 00:19:00,650
data is unbelievably noisy so why should
the calculation be not noisy and people

874
00:19:00,650 --> 00:19:00,660
the calculation be not noisy and people
 

875
00:19:00,660 --> 00:19:02,299
the calculation be not noisy and people
have experimented with algorithms that

876
00:19:02,299 --> 00:19:02,309
have experimented with algorithms that
 

877
00:19:02,309 --> 00:19:04,820
have experimented with algorithms that
say can get faster answers by being

878
00:19:04,820 --> 00:19:04,830
say can get faster answers by being
 

879
00:19:04,830 --> 00:19:07,160
say can get faster answers by being
noisy like as the network starts to

880
00:19:07,160 --> 00:19:07,170
noisy like as the network starts to
 

881
00:19:07,170 --> 00:19:09,260
noisy like as the network starts to
converge if you look at the computation

882
00:19:09,260 --> 00:19:09,270
converge if you look at the computation
 

883
00:19:09,270 --> 00:19:11,060
converge if you look at the computation
graph it starts out really wide and it

884
00:19:11,060 --> 00:19:11,070
graph it starts out really wide and it
 

885
00:19:11,070 --> 00:19:12,919
graph it starts out really wide and it
gets narrower and you can say is that

886
00:19:12,919 --> 00:19:12,929
gets narrower and you can say is that
 

887
00:19:12,929 --> 00:19:14,720
gets narrower and you can say is that
last little bit that important or should

888
00:19:14,720 --> 00:19:14,730
last little bit that important or should
 

889
00:19:14,730 --> 00:19:17,120

I start to graph on the next rap rev

890
00:19:17,120 --> 00:19:17,130
I start to graph on the next rap rev
 

891
00:19:17,130 --> 00:19:19,610
I start to graph on the next rap rev
before we would live all the way down to

892
00:19:19,610 --> 00:19:19,620
before we would live all the way down to
 

893
00:19:19,620 --> 00:19:21,950
before we would live all the way down to
the answer right so you can create

894
00:19:21,950 --> 00:19:21,960
the answer right so you can create
 

895
00:19:21,960 --> 00:19:24,380
the answer right so you can create
algorithms that are noisy now if you're

896
00:19:24,380 --> 00:19:24,390
algorithms that are noisy now if you're
 

897
00:19:24,390 --> 00:19:26,150
algorithms that are noisy now if you're
developing something and every time you

898
00:19:26,150 --> 00:19:26,160
developing something and every time you
 

899
00:19:26,160 --> 00:19:27,500
developing something and every time you
run it you get a different answer it's

900
00:19:27,500 --> 00:19:27,510
run it you get a different answer it's
 

901
00:19:27,510 --> 00:19:32,140
run it you get a different answer it's
really annoying and so most people think

902
00:19:32,140 --> 00:19:32,150
really annoying and so most people think
 

903
00:19:32,150 --> 00:19:34,669
really annoying and so most people think
even today every time you run the

904
00:19:34,669 --> 00:19:34,679
even today every time you run the
 

905
00:19:34,679 --> 00:19:36,890
even today every time you run the
program you get the same answer now I

906
00:19:36,890 --> 00:19:36,900
program you get the same answer now I
 

907
00:19:36,900 --> 00:19:38,840
program you get the same answer now I
know but the question is that's the

908
00:19:38,840 --> 00:19:38,850
know but the question is that's the
 

909
00:19:38,850 --> 00:19:41,390
know but the question is that's the
formal definition of a programming

910
00:19:41,390 --> 00:19:41,400
formal definition of a programming
 

911
00:19:41,400 --> 00:19:43,790
formal definition of a programming
language there is a definition of

912
00:19:43,790 --> 00:19:43,800
language there is a definition of
 

913
00:19:43,800 --> 00:19:45,680
language there is a definition of
languages that don't get the same answer

914
00:19:45,680 --> 00:19:45,690
languages that don't get the same answer
 

915
00:19:45,690 --> 00:19:49,130
languages that don't get the same answer
but people who use those you always want

916
00:19:49,130 --> 00:19:49,140
but people who use those you always want
 

917
00:19:49,140 --> 00:19:50,720
but people who use those you always want
something because you get a bad answer

918
00:19:50,720 --> 00:19:50,730
something because you get a bad answer
 

919
00:19:50,730 --> 00:19:52,190
something because you get a bad answer
and then you're wondering is it because

920
00:19:52,190 --> 00:19:52,200
and then you're wondering is it because
 

921
00:19:52,200 --> 00:19:53,420
and then you're wondering is it because
right

922
00:19:53,420 --> 00:19:53,430
right
 

923
00:19:53,430 --> 00:19:55,010
right
something in your brother because of

924
00:19:55,010 --> 00:19:55,020
something in your brother because of
 

925
00:19:55,020 --> 00:19:56,300
something in your brother because of
this and so everybody wants a little

926
00:19:56,300 --> 00:19:56,310
this and so everybody wants a little
 

927
00:19:56,310 --> 00:19:59,000
this and so everybody wants a little
swish that says no matter what ya do it

928
00:19:59,000 --> 00:19:59,010
swish that says no matter what ya do it
 

929
00:19:59,010 --> 00:20:01,040
swish that says no matter what ya do it
deterministically and it's really weird

930
00:20:01,040 --> 00:20:01,050
deterministically and it's really weird
 

931
00:20:01,050 --> 00:20:02,960
deterministically and it's really weird
because almost everything going into

932
00:20:02,960 --> 00:20:02,970
because almost everything going into
 

933
00:20:02,970 --> 00:20:04,700
because almost everything going into
monetary calculations is noisy

934
00:20:04,700 --> 00:20:04,710
monetary calculations is noisy
 

935
00:20:04,710 --> 00:20:07,400
monetary calculations is noisy
so why the answers have to be so clear

936
00:20:07,400 --> 00:20:07,410
so why the answers have to be so clear
 

937
00:20:07,410 --> 00:20:09,530
so why the answers have to be so clear
it's right so where do you stand by

938
00:20:09,530 --> 00:20:09,540
it's right so where do you stand by
 

939
00:20:09,540 --> 00:20:11,240
it's right so where do you stand by
design computers for people who run

940
00:20:11,240 --> 00:20:11,250
design computers for people who run
 

941
00:20:11,250 --> 00:20:14,720
design computers for people who run
programs so somebody says I want in

942
00:20:14,720 --> 00:20:14,730
programs so somebody says I want in
 

943
00:20:14,730 --> 00:20:17,630
programs so somebody says I want in
deterministic answer like most people

944
00:20:17,630 --> 00:20:17,640
deterministic answer like most people
 

945
00:20:17,640 --> 00:20:19,130
deterministic answer like most people
want that can you deliver a

946
00:20:19,130 --> 00:20:19,140
want that can you deliver a
 

947
00:20:19,140 --> 00:20:20,630
want that can you deliver a
deterministic answer I guess is the

948
00:20:20,630 --> 00:20:20,640
deterministic answer I guess is the
 

949
00:20:20,640 --> 00:20:23,200
deterministic answer I guess is the
question like when you hopefully sure

950
00:20:23,200 --> 00:20:23,210
question like when you hopefully sure
 

951
00:20:23,210 --> 00:20:25,730
question like when you hopefully sure
that's what people don't realize is you

952
00:20:25,730 --> 00:20:25,740
that's what people don't realize is you
 

953
00:20:25,740 --> 00:20:27,590
that's what people don't realize is you
get a deterministic answer even though

954

00:20:29,340 --> 00:20:31,970
the execution flow is very own
deterministic so if you run this program

958
00:20:31,970 --> 00:20:31,980
deterministic so if you run this program
 

959
00:20:31,980 --> 00:20:34,370
deterministic so if you run this program
a hundred times it never runs the same

00:20:34,380 --> 00:20:37,520
a hundred times it never runs the same
way twice ever and the answer it arises

00:21:19,780 --> 00:21:19,790
this question yeah so I dude so I I'm
 

989
00:21:19,790 --> 00:21:21,650
this question yeah so I dude so I I'm
I'm really interested in building

990
00:21:21,650 --> 00:21:21,660
I'm really interested in building
 

991
00:21:21,660 --> 00:21:25,760
I'm really interested in building
computers and I've worked with really

992
00:21:25,760 --> 00:21:25,770
computers and I've worked with really
 

993
00:21:25,770 --> 00:21:26,780
computers and I've worked with really
really smart people

994
00:21:26,780 --> 00:21:26,790
really smart people
 

995
00:21:26,790 --> 00:21:30,140
really smart people
I'm not unbelievably smart I'm

996
00:21:30,140 --> 00:21:30,150
I'm not unbelievably smart I'm
 

997
00:21:30,150 --> 00:21:32,270
I'm not unbelievably smart I'm
fascinated by how they go together both

998
00:21:32,270 --> 00:21:32,280
fascinated by how they go together both
 

999
00:21:32,280 --> 00:21:35,810
fascinated by how they go together both
as a as a thing to do and is endeavor

1000
00:21:35,810 --> 00:21:35,820
as a as a thing to do and is endeavor
 

1001
00:21:35,820 --> 00:21:39,230
as a as a thing to do and is endeavor
that people do how people in computers

1002
00:21:39,230 --> 00:21:39,240
that people do how people in computers
 

1003
00:21:39,240 --> 00:21:41,600
that people do how people in computers
go together yeah like how people think

1004
00:21:41,600 --> 00:21:41,610
go together yeah like how people think
 

1005
00:21:41,610 --> 00:21:44,780
go together yeah like how people think
and build a computer and I find

1006
00:21:44,780 --> 00:21:44,790
and build a computer and I find
 

1007
00:21:44,790 --> 00:21:47,180
and build a computer and I find
sometimes that the best computer

1008
00:21:47,180 --> 00:21:47,190
sometimes that the best computer
 

1009
00:21:47,190 --> 00:21:48,740
sometimes that the best computer
architects aren't that interested in

1010
00:21:48,740 --> 00:21:48,750
architects aren't that interested in
 

1011
00:21:48,750 --> 00:21:50,600
architects aren't that interested in
people or the best people managers

1012
00:21:50,600 --> 00:21:50,610
people or the best people managers
 

1013
00:21:50,610 --> 00:21:53,500
people or the best people managers
aren't that good at designing computers

1014
00:21:53,500 --> 00:21:53,510
aren't that good at designing computers
 

1015
00:21:53,510 --> 00:21:56,420
aren't that good at designing computers
so the whole stack of human beings is

1016
00:21:56,420 --> 00:21:56,430
so the whole stack of human beings is
 

1017
00:21:56,430 --> 00:21:58,250
so the whole stack of human beings is
fascinating so the managers individual

1018
00:21:58,250 --> 00:21:58,260
fascinating so the managers individual
 

1019
00:21:58,260 --> 00:22:01,340
fascinating so the managers individual
engineers yeah I just I said I realized

1020
00:22:01,340 --> 00:22:01,350
engineers yeah I just I said I realized
 

1021
00:22:01,350 --> 00:22:02,660
engineers yeah I just I said I realized
after a lot of years of building

1022
00:22:02,660 --> 00:22:02,670
after a lot of years of building
 

1023
00:22:02,670 --> 00:22:04,400
after a lot of years of building
computers where you sort of build them

1024
00:22:04,400 --> 00:22:04,410
computers where you sort of build them
 

1025
00:22:04,410 --> 00:22:05,660
computers where you sort of build them
out of the transistors logic gates

1026
00:22:05,660 --> 00:22:05,670
out of the transistors logic gates
 

1027
00:22:05,670 --> 00:22:06,890
out of the transistors logic gates
functional units come

1028
00:22:06,890 --> 00:22:06,900
functional units come
 

1029
00:22:06,900 --> 00:22:08,990
functional units come
computational elements that you could

1030
00:22:08,990 --> 00:22:09,000
computational elements that you could
 

1031
00:22:09,000 --> 00:22:11,270
computational elements that you could
think of people the same way so people

1032
00:22:11,270 --> 00:22:11,280
think of people the same way so people
 

1033
00:22:11,280 --> 00:22:12,980
think of people the same way so people
are functional units yes and then you

1034
00:22:12,980 --> 00:22:12,990
are functional units yes and then you
 

1035
00:22:12,990 --> 00:22:14,630
are functional units yes and then you
can think of organizational design it's

1036
00:22:14,630 --> 00:22:14,640
can think of organizational design it's
 

1037
00:22:14,640 --> 00:22:16,210
can think of organizational design it's
a computer architectural problem and

1038
00:22:16,210 --> 00:22:16,220
a computer architectural problem and
 

1039
00:22:16,220 --> 00:22:19,010
a computer architectural problem and
then it's like oh that's super cool

1040
00:22:19,010 --> 00:22:19,020
then it's like oh that's super cool
 

1041
00:22:19,020 --> 00:22:20,660
then it's like oh that's super cool
because the people are all different

1042
00:22:20,660 --> 00:22:20,670
because the people are all different
 

1043
00:22:20,670 --> 00:22:22,430
because the people are all different
just like the computation elephants are

1044
00:22:22,430 --> 00:22:22,440
just like the computation elephants are
 

1045
00:22:22,440 --> 00:22:24,710
just like the computation elephants are
all different and they like to do

1046
00:22:24,710 --> 00:22:24,720
all different and they like to do
 

1047
00:22:24,720 --> 00:22:27,950
all different and they like to do
different things and and so I had a lot

1048
00:22:27,950 --> 00:22:27,960
different things and and so I had a lot
 

1049
00:22:27,960 --> 00:22:29,780
different things and and so I had a lot
of fun like reframing how I think about

1050
00:22:29,780 --> 00:22:29,790
of fun like reframing how I think about
 

1051
00:22:29,790 --> 00:22:33,320
of fun like reframing how I think about
organizations just like with with

1052
00:22:33,320 --> 00:22:33,330
organizations just like with with
 

1053
00:22:33,330 --> 00:22:35,570
organizations just like with with
computers we were saying execution paths

1054
00:22:35,570 --> 00:22:35,580
computers we were saying execution paths
 

1055
00:22:35,580 --> 00:22:37,220
computers we were saying execution paths
you can have a lot of different paths

1056
00:22:37,220 --> 00:22:37,230
you can have a lot of different paths
 

1057
00:22:37,230 --> 00:22:40,670
you can have a lot of different paths
that end up at a at at the same good

1058
00:22:40,670 --> 00:22:40,680
that end up at a at at the same good
 

1059
00:22:40,680 --> 00:22:42,350
that end up at a at at the same good
destination so what have you learned

1060
00:22:42,350 --> 00:22:42,360
destination so what have you learned
 

1061
00:22:42,360 --> 00:22:45,950
destination so what have you learned
about the human abstractions from

1062
00:22:45,950 --> 00:22:45,960
about the human abstractions from
 

1063
00:22:45,960 --> 00:22:49,370
about the human abstractions from
individual functional human units to the

1064
00:22:49,370 --> 00:22:49,380
individual functional human units to the
 

1065
00:22:49,380 --> 00:22:52,760
individual functional human units to the
broader organization what does it take

1066
00:22:52,760 --> 00:22:52,770
broader organization what does it take
 

1067
00:22:52,770 --> 00:22:56,840
broader organization what does it take
to create something special well most

1068
00:22:56,840 --> 00:22:56,850
to create something special well most
 

1069
00:22:56,850 --> 00:23:00,380
to create something special well most
people don't think simple enough all

1070
00:23:00,380 --> 00:23:00,390
people don't think simple enough all
 

1071
00:23:00,390 --> 00:23:01,580
people don't think simple enough all
right so do you know the difference

1072
00:23:01,580 --> 00:23:01,590
right so do you know the difference
 

1073
00:23:01,590 --> 00:23:05,440
right so do you know the difference
between a recipe and understanding

1074
00:23:05,440 --> 00:23:05,450
between a recipe and understanding
 

1075
00:23:05,450 --> 00:23:07,490
between a recipe and understanding
there's probably a philosophical

1076
00:23:07,490 --> 00:23:07,500
there's probably a philosophical
 

1077
00:23:07,500 --> 00:23:09,800
there's probably a philosophical
description of this so imagine you can

1078
00:23:09,800 --> 00:23:09,810
description of this so imagine you can
 

1079
00:23:09,810 --> 00:23:11,900
description of this so imagine you can
make a loaf of bread yeah the recipe

1080
00:23:11,900 --> 00:23:11,910
make a loaf of bread yeah the recipe
 

1081
00:23:11,910 --> 00:23:14,090
make a loaf of bread yeah the recipe
says get some flour add some water add

1082
00:23:14,090 --> 00:23:14,100
says get some flour add some water add
 

1083
00:23:14,100 --> 00:23:17,060
says get some flour add some water add
some yeast mix it up let it rise put it

1084
00:23:17,060 --> 00:23:17,070
some yeast mix it up let it rise put it
 

1085
00:23:17,070 --> 00:23:19,520
some yeast mix it up let it rise put it
in a pan put it in the oven it's a

1086
00:23:19,520 --> 00:23:19,530
in a pan put it in the oven it's a
 

1087
00:23:19,530 --> 00:23:23,450
in a pan put it in the oven it's a
recipe right understanding bread you can

1088
00:23:23,450 --> 00:23:23,460
recipe right understanding bread you can
 

1089
00:23:23,460 --> 00:23:26,050
recipe right understanding bread you can
understand biology supply chains

1090
00:23:26,050 --> 00:23:26,060
understand biology supply chains
 

1091
00:23:26,060 --> 00:23:31,120
understand biology supply chains
you know grain grinders yeast physics

1092
00:23:31,120 --> 00:23:31,130
you know grain grinders yeast physics
 

1093
00:23:31,130 --> 00:23:34,880
you know grain grinders yeast physics
you know thermodynamics like there's so

1094
00:23:34,880 --> 00:23:34,890
you know thermodynamics like there's so
 

1095
00:23:34,890 --> 00:23:36,770
you know thermodynamics like there's so
many levels of understanding there and

1096
00:23:36,770 --> 00:23:36,780
many levels of understanding there and
 

1097
00:23:36,780 --> 00:23:39,500
many levels of understanding there and
then when people build and design things

1098
00:23:39,500 --> 00:23:39,510
then when people build and design things
 

1099
00:23:39,510 --> 00:23:42,440
then when people build and design things
they frequently are executing some stack

1100
00:23:42,440 --> 00:23:42,450
they frequently are executing some stack
 

1101
00:23:42,450 --> 00:23:45,830
they frequently are executing some stack
of recipes right and the problem with

1102
00:23:45,830 --> 00:23:45,840
of recipes right and the problem with
 

1103
00:23:45,840 --> 00:23:47,450
of recipes right and the problem with
that is the recipes all have a limited

1104
00:23:47,450 --> 00:23:47,460
that is the recipes all have a limited
 

1105
00:23:47,460 --> 00:23:49,880
that is the recipes all have a limited
scope look if you have a really good

1106
00:23:49,880 --> 00:23:49,890
scope look if you have a really good
 

1107
00:23:49,890 --> 00:23:51,650
scope look if you have a really good
recipe book for making bread it won't

1108
00:23:51,650 --> 00:23:51,660
recipe book for making bread it won't
 

1109
00:23:51,660 --> 00:23:53,030
recipe book for making bread it won't
tell you anything about how to make an

1110
00:23:53,030 --> 00:23:53,040
tell you anything about how to make an
 

1111
00:23:53,040 --> 00:23:55,430
tell you anything about how to make an
omelet right right but if you have a

1112

00:26:14,590 --> 00:26:15,990
practice is you build a computer and
then when somebody says I want to make

1216
00:26:15,990 --> 00:26:16,000
then when somebody says I want to make
 

1217
00:26:16,000 --> 00:26:18,690
then when somebody says I want to make
it 10% faster you'll go in and say

1218
00:26:18,690 --> 00:26:18,700
it 10% faster you'll go in and say
 

1219
00:26:18,700 --> 00:26:20,220
it 10% faster you'll go in and say
alright I need to make this buffer

1220
00:26:20,220 --> 00:26:20,230
alright I need to make this buffer
 

1221
00:26:20,230 --> 00:26:22,560
alright I need to make this buffer
bigger and maybe I'll add an ad unit or

1222
00:26:22,560 --> 00:26:22,570
bigger and maybe I'll add an ad unit or
 

1223
00:26:22,570 --> 00:26:24,509
bigger and maybe I'll add an ad unit or
you know I have this thing that's three

1224
00:26:24,509 --> 00:26:24,519
you know I have this thing that's three
 

1225
00:26:24,519 --> 00:26:25,950
you know I have this thing that's three
instructions wide I'm going to make it

1226
00:26:25,950 --> 00:26:25,960
instructions wide I'm going to make it
 

1227
00:26:25,960 --> 00:26:29,159
instructions wide I'm going to make it
four instructions wide and what you see

1228
00:26:29,159 --> 00:26:29,169
four instructions wide and what you see
 

1229
00:26:29,169 --> 00:26:31,620
four instructions wide and what you see
is each piece gets incrementally more

1230
00:26:31,620 --> 00:26:31,630
is each piece gets incrementally more
 

1231
00:26:31,630 --> 00:26:33,659
is each piece gets incrementally more
complicated right

1232
00:26:33,659 --> 00:26:33,669
complicated right
 

1233
00:26:33,669 --> 00:26:35,609
complicated right
and then at some point you hit this

1234
00:26:35,609 --> 00:26:35,619
and then at some point you hit this
 

1235
00:26:35,619 --> 00:26:38,639
and then at some point you hit this
limit like adding another feature or a

1236
00:26:38,639 --> 00:26:38,649
limit like adding another feature or a
 

1237
00:26:38,649 --> 00:26:40,199
limit like adding another feature or a
buffer doesn't seem to make it any

1238
00:26:40,199 --> 00:26:40,209
buffer doesn't seem to make it any
 

1239
00:26:40,209 --> 00:26:42,239
buffer doesn't seem to make it any
faster and then people say well that's

1240
00:26:42,239 --> 00:26:42,249
faster and then people say well that's
 

1241
00:26:42,249 --> 00:26:44,999
faster and then people say well that's
because it's a fundamental limit and

1242
00:26:44,999 --> 00:26:45,009
because it's a fundamental limit and
 

1243
00:26:45,009 --> 00:26:46,889
because it's a fundamental limit and
then somebody else to look at it and say

1244
00:26:46,889 --> 00:26:46,899
then somebody else to look at it and say
 

1245
00:26:46,899 --> 00:26:48,449
then somebody else to look at it and say
well actually the way you divided the

1246
00:26:48,449 --> 00:26:48,459
well actually the way you divided the
 

1247
00:26:48,459 --> 00:26:50,430
well actually the way you divided the
problem up and the way that different

1248
00:26:50,430 --> 00:26:50,440
problem up and the way that different
 

1249
00:26:50,440 --> 00:26:52,889
problem up and the way that different
features are interacting is limiting you

1250
00:26:52,889 --> 00:26:52,899
features are interacting is limiting you
 

1251
00:26:52,899 --> 00:26:54,829
features are interacting is limiting you
and it has to be rethought rewritten

1252
00:26:54,829 --> 00:26:54,839
and it has to be rethought rewritten
 

1253
00:26:54,839 --> 00:26:57,569
and it has to be rethought rewritten
right so then you refactor it and

1254
00:26:57,569 --> 00:26:57,579
right so then you refactor it and
 

1255
00:26:57,579 --> 00:26:59,339
right so then you refactor it and
rewrite it and what people commonly find

1256
00:26:59,339 --> 00:26:59,349
rewrite it and what people commonly find
 

1257
00:26:59,349 --> 00:27:01,979
rewrite it and what people commonly find
is the rewrite is not only faster but

1258
00:27:01,979 --> 00:27:01,989
is the rewrite is not only faster but
 

1259
00:27:01,989 --> 00:27:05,219
is the rewrite is not only faster but
half is complicated from scratch yes so

1260
00:27:05,219 --> 00:27:05,229
half is complicated from scratch yes so
 

1261
00:27:05,229 --> 00:27:07,859
half is complicated from scratch yes so
how often in your career but just have

00:27:17,279 --> 00:27:17,289
this is where I'm on one end of it every
 

1269
00:27:17,289 --> 00:27:20,069
this is where I'm on one end of it every
three to five years which end are you on

1270
00:27:20,069 --> 00:27:20,079
three to five years which end are you on
 

1271
00:27:20,079 --> 00:27:23,669
three to five years which end are you on
like rewrite more often right and three

1272
00:27:23,669 --> 00:27:23,679
like rewrite more often right and three
 

1273
00:27:23,679 --> 00:27:25,889
like rewrite more often right and three
or five years is if you want to really

1274
00:27:25,889 --> 00:27:25,899
or five years is if you want to really
 

1275
00:27:25,899 --> 00:27:27,419
or five years is if you want to really
make a lot of progress on computer

1276
00:27:27,419 --> 00:27:27,429
make a lot of progress on computer
 

1277
00:27:27,429 --> 00:27:29,069
make a lot of progress on computer
architecture every five years you should

1278
00:27:29,069 --> 00:27:29,079
architecture every five years you should
 

1279
00:27:29,079 --> 00:27:33,469
architecture every five years you should
do one from scratch so where does the

1280
00:27:33,469 --> 00:27:33,479
do one from scratch so where does the
 

1281
00:27:33,479 --> 00:27:37,079
do one from scratch so where does the
x86 64 standard come in or what how

1282
00:27:37,079 --> 00:27:37,089
x86 64 standard come in or what how
 

1283
00:27:37,089 --> 00:27:39,839
x86 64 standard come in or what how
often do you I wrote the I was the

1284
00:27:39,839 --> 00:27:39,849
often do you I wrote the I was the
 

1285
00:27:39,849 --> 00:27:42,779
often do you I wrote the I was the
co-author that's back in 98 that's 20

1286
00:27:42,779 --> 00:27:42,789
co-author that's back in 98 that's 20
 

1287
00:27:42,789 --> 00:27:44,999
co-author that's back in 98 that's 20
years ago yeah so that's still around

1288
00:27:44,999 --> 00:27:45,009
years ago yeah so that's still around
 

1289
00:27:45,009 --> 00:27:47,639
years ago yeah so that's still around
the instruction set it stuff has been

1290
00:27:47,639 --> 00:27:47,649
the instruction set it stuff has been
 

1291
00:27:47,649 --> 00:27:50,329
the instruction set it stuff has been
extended quite a few times yes and

1292
00:27:50,329 --> 00:27:50,339
extended quite a few times yes and
 

1293
00:27:50,339 --> 00:27:52,409
extended quite a few times yes and
instruction sets are less interesting

1294
00:27:52,409 --> 00:27:52,419
instruction sets are less interesting
 

1295
00:27:52,419 --> 00:27:54,930
instruction sets are less interesting
and implementation underneath there's

1296
00:27:54,930 --> 00:27:54,940
and implementation underneath there's
 

1297
00:27:54,940 --> 00:27:57,869
and implementation underneath there's
been on x86 architecture Intel's

1301
00:27:59,859 --> 00:28:05,009

very different architectures and I don't

1302
00:28:05,009 --> 00:28:05,019
very different architectures and I don't
 

1303
00:28:05,019 --> 00:28:06,449
very different architectures and I don't
want to go into too much of the detail

1304
00:28:06,449 --> 00:28:06,459
want to go into too much of the detail
 

1305
00:28:06,459 --> 00:28:10,079
want to go into too much of the detail
about how often but it's there's a

1306
00:28:10,079 --> 00:28:10,089
about how often but it's there's a
 

1307
00:28:10,089 --> 00:28:12,119
about how often but it's there's a
tendency to rewrite it every you know 10

1308
00:28:12,119 --> 00:28:12,129
tendency to rewrite it every you know 10
 

1309
00:28:12,129 --> 00:28:14,299
tendency to rewrite it every you know 10
years and it really should be every five

1310
00:28:14,299 --> 00:28:14,309
years and it really should be every five
 

1311
00:28:14,309 --> 00:28:16,949
years and it really should be every five
so you're saying you're an outlier in

1312
00:28:16,949 --> 00:28:16,959
so you're saying you're an outlier in
 

1313
00:28:16,959 --> 00:28:19,229
so you're saying you're an outlier in
that sense in really more often we write

1314
00:28:19,229 --> 00:28:19,239
that sense in really more often we write
 

1315
00:28:19,239 --> 00:28:21,229
that sense in really more often we write
more often well in here isn't that scary

1316
00:28:21,229 --> 00:28:21,239
more often well in here isn't that scary
 

1317
00:28:21,239 --> 00:28:22,799
more often well in here isn't that scary
yeah of course

1318
00:28:22,799 --> 00:28:22,809
yeah of course
 

1319
00:28:22,809 --> 00:28:26,459
yeah of course
well scary - who - everybody involved

1320
00:28:26,459 --> 00:28:26,469
well scary - who - everybody involved
 

1321

you have a project and you start here

1340
00:28:49,770 --> 00:28:49,780
you have a project and you start here
 

1341
00:28:49,780 --> 00:28:51,330
you have a project and you start here
and it goes up and they have Domitian

1342
00:28:51,330 --> 00:28:51,340
and it goes up and they have Domitian
 

1343
00:28:51,340 --> 00:28:53,640
and it goes up and they have Domitian
return and to get to the next level you

1344
00:28:53,640 --> 00:28:53,650
return and to get to the next level you
 

1345
00:28:53,650 --> 00:28:55,560
return and to get to the next level you
have to do a new one in the initial

1346
00:28:55,560 --> 00:28:55,570
have to do a new one in the initial
 

1347

have to do a new one in the initial
starting point will be lower than the

00:28:58,230 --> 00:28:58,240
starting point will be lower than the
 

1349
00:28:58,240 --> 00:29:00,660
starting point will be lower than the
old optimization point but it'll get

1350
00:29:00,660 --> 00:29:00,670
old optimization point but it'll get
 

1351
00:29:00,670 --> 00:29:03,240
old optimization point but it'll get
higher so now you have two kinds of fear

1352
00:29:03,240 --> 00:29:03,250
higher so now you have two kinds of fear
 

1353
00:29:03,250 --> 00:29:05,970
higher so now you have two kinds of fear
short-term disaster and long-term

short-term disaster and long-term
 

1355
00:29:05,980 --> 00:29:10,650
short-term disaster and long-term
disaster and you're you're wrong right

1356
00:29:10,650 --> 00:29:10,660
disaster and you're you're wrong right
 

1357

disaster and you're you're wrong right
like you know people with a quarter by

1358
00:29:13,350 --> 00:29:13,360
like you know people with a quarter by
 

1359
00:29:13,360 --> 00:29:15,960
like you know people with a quarter by
quarter business objective are terrified

1360
00:29:15,960 --> 00:29:15,970
quarter business objective are terrified
 

1361
00:29:15,970 --> 00:29:17,910
quarter business objective are terrified
about changing everything yeah and

1362
00:29:17,910 --> 00:29:17,920
about changing everything yeah and
 

1363
00:29:17,920 --> 00:29:20,580
about changing everything yeah and
people who are trying to run a business

1364
00:29:20,580 --> 00:29:20,590
people who are trying to run a business
 

1365
00:29:20,590 --> 00:29:22,800
people who are trying to run a business
or build a computer for a long term

1366
00:29:22,800 --> 00:29:22,810
or build a computer for a long term
 

1367
00:29:22,810 --> 00:29:24,890
or build a computer for a long term
objective know that the short-term

1368
00:29:24,890 --> 00:29:24,900
objective know that the short-term
 

1369
00:29:24,900 --> 00:29:27,690
objective know that the short-term
limitations block them from the long

1370
00:29:27,690 --> 00:29:27,700
limitations block them from the long
 

1371
00:29:27,700 --> 00:29:30,840
limitations block them from the long
term success so if you look at leaders

1372
00:29:30,840 --> 00:29:30,850
term success so if you look at leaders
 

1373
00:29:30,850 --> 00:29:33,570
term success so if you look at leaders
of companies that had really good

1374
00:29:33,570 --> 00:29:33,580
of companies that had really good
 

1375
00:29:33,580 --> 00:29:36,030
of companies that had really good
long-term success every time they saw

1376
00:29:36,030 --> 00:29:36,040
long-term success every time they saw
 

1377
00:29:36,040 --> 00:29:38,060
long-term success every time they saw
that they had to redo something they did

1378
00:29:38,060 --> 00:29:38,070
that they had to redo something they did
 

1379
00:29:38,070 --> 00:29:41,370
that they had to redo something they did
and so somebody has to speak up or you

1380
00:29:41,370 --> 00:29:41,380
and so somebody has to speak up or you
 

1381
00:29:41,380 --> 00:29:43,230
and so somebody has to speak up or you
do multiple projects in parallel like

1382
00:29:43,230 --> 00:29:43,240
do multiple projects in parallel like
 

1383
00:29:43,240 --> 00:29:45,030
do multiple projects in parallel like
you optimize the old one while you build

1384
00:29:45,030 --> 00:29:45,040
you optimize the old one while you build
 

1385
00:29:45,040 --> 00:29:47,460
you optimize the old one while you build
a new one and but the marketing guys

1386
00:29:47,460 --> 00:29:47,470
a new one and but the marketing guys
 

1387
00:29:47,470 --> 00:29:49,230
a new one and but the marketing guys
they're always like make promise me that

1388
00:29:49,230 --> 00:29:49,240
they're always like make promise me that
 

1389
00:29:49,240 --> 00:29:51,030
they're always like make promise me that
the new computer is faster on every

1390
00:29:51,030 --> 00:29:51,040
the new computer is faster on every
 

1391
00:29:51,040 --> 00:29:53,640
the new computer is faster on every
single thing and the computer architect

1392
00:29:53,640 --> 00:29:53,650
single thing and the computer architect
 

1393
00:29:53,650 --> 00:29:54,900
single thing and the computer architect
says well the new computer will be

1394
00:29:54,900 --> 00:29:54,910
says well the new computer will be
 

1395
00:29:54,910 --> 00:29:57,270
says well the new computer will be
faster on the average but there's a

1396
00:29:57,270 --> 00:29:57,280
faster on the average but there's a
 

1397
00:29:57,280 --> 00:29:59,340
faster on the average but there's a
distribution or results in performance

1398
00:29:59,340 --> 00:29:59,350
distribution or results in performance
 

1399
00:29:59,350 --> 00:30:00,780
distribution or results in performance
and you'll have some outliers that are

1400
00:30:00,780 --> 00:30:00,790
and you'll have some outliers that are
 

1401
00:30:00,790 --> 00:30:02,970
and you'll have some outliers that are
slower and that's very hard because they

1402
00:30:02,970 --> 00:30:02,980
slower and that's very hard because they
 

1403
00:30:02,980 --> 00:30:04,410
slower and that's very hard because they
have one customer cares about that one

1404
00:30:04,410 --> 00:30:04,420
have one customer cares about that one
 

1405
00:30:04,420 --> 00:30:07,950
have one customer cares about that one
so speaking of the long-term for over 50

double the number of transistors every
 

1429
00:30:36,250 --> 00:30:39,600
double the number of transistors every
two years something like that and then

1430
00:30:39,600 --> 00:30:39,610
two years something like that and then
 

1431
00:30:39,610 --> 00:30:43,980

my operational model is we increased the
 

1433
00:30:43,990 --> 00:30:47,220
my operational model is we increased the
performance of computers by 2x every 2

00:30:49,320 --> 00:30:49,330
or 3 years and it's wiggled around
 

1437
00:30:49,330 --> 00:30:53,160
or 3 years and it's wiggled around
substantially over time and also in how

substantially over time and also in how
 

1439
00:30:53,170 --> 00:30:57,030

Moore's law well first of all so I I've

00:31:44,950 --> 00:31:44,960
Moore's law well first of all so I I've
 

1477
00:31:44,960 --> 00:31:47,190
Moore's law well first of all so I I've
been aware of Moore's law for 30 years

00:31:47,190 --> 00:31:47,200
been aware of Moore's law for 30 years

your eyes kind of slow and somewhere

1484
00:31:57,040 --> 00:31:57,050
your eyes kind of slow and somewhere
 

1485
00:31:57,050 --> 00:31:58,540
your eyes kind of slow and somewhere
where I became aware of it I was also

1486
00:31:58,540 --> 00:31:58,550
where I became aware of it I was also
 

1487
00:31:58,550 --> 00:32:00,280
where I became aware of it I was also
informed that Moore's law was gonna die

1488
00:32:00,280 --> 00:32:00,290
informed that Moore's law was gonna die
 

1489
00:32:00,290 --> 00:32:02,980
informed that Moore's law was gonna die
in 10 to 15 years and I thought that was

1490
00:32:02,980 --> 00:32:02,990
in 10 to 15 years and I thought that was
 

1491
00:32:02,990 --> 00:32:05,320
in 10 to 15 years and I thought that was
true at first but then after 10 years it

1492
00:32:05,320 --> 00:32:05,330
true at first but then after 10 years it
 

1493
00:32:05,330 --> 00:32:07,780
true at first but then after 10 years it
was gonna die in 10 to 15 years and then

1494
00:32:07,780 --> 00:32:07,790
was gonna die in 10 to 15 years and then
 

1495
00:32:07,790 --> 00:32:09,580
was gonna die in 10 to 15 years and then
at one point it was gonna die in 5 years

1496
00:32:09,580 --> 00:32:09,590
at one point it was gonna die in 5 years
 

1497
00:32:09,590 --> 00:32:11,170
at one point it was gonna die in 5 years
and then it went back up to ten years

1498
00:32:11,170 --> 00:32:11,180
and then it went back up to ten years
 

1499
00:32:11,180 --> 00:32:13,330
and then it went back up to ten years
and at some point I decided not to worry

1500
00:32:13,330 --> 00:32:13,340
and at some point I decided not to worry
 

1501
00:32:13,340 --> 00:32:15,280
and at some point I decided not to worry
about that particular product

1502
00:32:15,280 --> 00:32:15,290
about that particular product
 

1503
00:32:15,290 --> 00:32:17,730
about that particular product
mastication for the rest of my life

dead and I thought that's sad because
 

1511
00:32:23,780 --> 00:32:26,020

it's the Moore's law company and it's

not dead well for Hartley let's just
 

1541
00:33:04,280 --> 00:33:06,790
not dead well for Hartley let's just
think people think Moore's law is one

diminishing return curves so if you

1552
00:33:17,710 --> 00:33:17,720
diminishing return curves so if you
 

1553
00:33:17,720 --> 00:33:19,480
diminishing return curves so if you
graph it it looks like a cascade of

1554
00:33:19,480 --> 00:33:19,490
graph it it looks like a cascade of
 

1555
00:33:19,490 --> 00:33:21,700
graph it it looks like a cascade of
diminishing return curves I don't know

1556
00:33:21,700 --> 00:33:21,710
diminishing return curves I don't know
 

1557
00:33:21,710 --> 00:33:24,100
diminishing return curves I don't know
what to call that but the result is an

1558
00:33:24,100 --> 00:33:24,110
what to call that but the result is an
 

1559
00:33:24,110 --> 00:33:27,460
what to call that but the result is an
exponential curve at least it has been

1560
00:33:27,460 --> 00:33:27,470
exponential curve at least it has been
 

1561
00:33:27,470 --> 00:33:31,000

so and we keep inventing new things so

1562
00:33:31,000 --> 00:33:31,010
so and we keep inventing new things so
 

1563
00:33:31,010 --> 00:33:32,800
so and we keep inventing new things so
if you're an expert in one of the things

1564
00:33:32,800 --> 00:33:32,810
if you're an expert in one of the things
 

1565
00:33:32,810 --> 00:33:35,950
if you're an expert in one of the things
on a diminishing return curve right and

1566
00:33:35,950 --> 00:33:35,960
on a diminishing return curve right and
 

1567
00:33:35,960 --> 00:33:38,680
on a diminishing return curve right and
you can see it's plateau you will

1568
00:33:38,680 --> 00:33:38,690
you can see it's plateau you will
 

1569
00:33:38,690 --> 00:33:40,900
you can see it's plateau you will
probably tell people well this is this

1570
00:33:40,900 --> 00:33:40,910
probably tell people well this is this

probably tell people well this is this
is done meanwhile some other pile of

00:33:43,360 --> 00:33:43,370
is done meanwhile some other pile of
 

1573
00:33:43,370 --> 00:33:46,540
is done meanwhile some other pile of
people are doing something different so

1574
00:33:46,540 --> 00:33:46,550
people are doing something different so
 

1575
00:33:46,550 --> 00:33:48,640
people are doing something different so
that's that's just normal so then

1576
00:33:48,640 --> 00:33:48,650
that's that's just normal so then
 

1577
00:33:48,650 --> 00:33:51,130
that's that's just normal so then
there's the observation of how small

1578
00:33:51,130 --> 00:33:51,140
there's the observation of how small
 

1579
00:33:51,140 --> 00:33:54,520
there's the observation of how small
could a switching device be so a modern

1580
00:33:54,520 --> 00:33:54,530
could a switching device be so a modern
 

1581
00:33:54,530 --> 00:33:56,230
could a switching device be so a modern
transistor is something like a thousand

1582
00:33:56,230 --> 00:33:56,240
transistor is something like a thousand
 

1583
00:33:56,240 --> 00:33:59,080
transistor is something like a thousand
by a thousand by thousand atoms right

1584
00:33:59,080 --> 00:33:59,090
by a thousand by thousand atoms right
 

1585
00:33:59,090 --> 00:34:01,690
by a thousand by thousand atoms right
and you get quantum effects down around

1586
00:34:01,690 --> 00:34:01,700
and you get quantum effects down around
 

1587
00:34:01,700 --> 00:34:05,110
and you get quantum effects down around
two to two to ten atoms so you can

1588
00:34:05,110 --> 00:34:05,120
two to two to ten atoms so you can
 

1589
00:34:05,120 --> 00:34:07,090
two to two to ten atoms so you can
imagine the transistor as small as 10 by

1590
00:34:07,090 --> 00:34:07,100
imagine the transistor as small as 10 by
 

1591
00:34:07,100 --> 00:34:09,840
imagine the transistor as small as 10 by
10 by 10 so that's a million times

1592
00:34:09,840 --> 00:34:09,850
10 by 10 so that's a million times
 

1593
00:34:09,850 --> 00:34:13,020
10 by 10 so that's a million times
smaller and then the quantum

1594
00:34:13,020 --> 00:34:13,030
smaller and then the quantum
 

1595
00:34:13,030 --> 00:34:15,280
smaller and then the quantum
computational people are working away at

1596
00:34:15,280 --> 00:34:15,290
computational people are working away at
 

1597
00:34:15,290 --> 00:34:20,500
computational people are working away at
how to use quantum effects so a thousand

1598
00:34:20,500 --> 00:34:20,510
how to use quantum effects so a thousand
 

1599
00:34:20,510 --> 00:34:24,010
how to use quantum effects so a thousand
by thousand five thousand atoms it's a

1600
00:34:24,010 --> 00:34:24,020
by thousand five thousand atoms it's a
 

1601
00:34:24,020 --> 00:34:27,190
by thousand five thousand atoms it's a
really clean way of putting it well fin

1602
00:34:27,190 --> 00:34:27,200
really clean way of putting it well fin
 

1603
00:34:27,200 --> 00:34:29,230
really clean way of putting it well fin
like a modern transistor if you look at

1604
00:34:29,230 --> 00:34:29,240
like a modern transistor if you look at
 

1605
00:34:29,240 --> 00:34:30,909
like a modern transistor if you look at
the fan it's like a hundred and twenty

1606
00:34:30,909 --> 00:34:30,919
the fan it's like a hundred and twenty
 

1607
00:34:30,919 --> 00:34:33,010
the fan it's like a hundred and twenty
atoms wide but we can make that thinner

1608
00:34:33,010 --> 00:34:33,020
atoms wide but we can make that thinner
 

1609
00:34:33,020 --> 00:34:35,110
atoms wide but we can make that thinner
and then there's there's a gate wrapped

1610
00:34:35,110 --> 00:34:35,120
and then there's there's a gate wrapped
 

1611
00:34:35,120 --> 00:34:36,820
and then there's there's a gate wrapped
around it and under spacing there's a

1612
00:34:36,820 --> 00:34:36,830
around it and under spacing there's a
 

1613
00:34:36,830 --> 00:34:40,419
around it and under spacing there's a
whole bunch of geometry and you know a

1614
00:34:40,419 --> 00:34:40,429
whole bunch of geometry and you know a
 

1615
00:34:40,429 --> 00:34:42,190

competent transistor designer could

1616
00:34:42,190 --> 00:34:42,200
competent transistor designer could
 

1617
00:34:42,200 --> 00:34:45,580
competent transistor designer could
count both atoms in every single

count both atoms in every single
 

1619
00:34:45,590 --> 00:34:48,940
count both atoms in every single

1621
00:34:48,950 --> 00:34:50,980

00:34:50,980 --> 00:34:50,990
already put down atoms in a single
 

1623
00:34:50,990 --> 00:34:54,310

1628
00:35:00,430 --> 00:35:00,440
manufacturing process if placing an atom
 

1629
00:35:00,440 --> 00:35:02,590
manufacturing process if placing an atom
takes ten minutes and you need to put

1630
00:35:02,590 --> 00:35:02,600
takes ten minutes and you need to put
 

1631
00:35:02,600 --> 00:35:05,380

you know 10 to the 23rd atoms together

1632
00:35:05,380 --> 00:35:05,390
you know 10 to the 23rd atoms together
 

1633
00:35:05,390 --> 00:35:07,360

to make a computer it would take a long

1634
00:35:07,360 --> 00:35:07,370
to make a computer it would take a long
 

1635
00:35:07,370 --> 00:35:11,350
to make a computer it would take a long

fundamental limit in physics I did a

1670
00:35:51,220 --> 00:35:51,230
fundamental limit in physics I did a
 

1671
00:35:51,230 --> 00:35:52,930
fundamental limit in physics I did a
talk on Moore's Law and I asked for a

00:35:52,930 --> 00:35:52,940
talk on Moore's Law and I asked for a
 

1673
00:35:52,940 --> 00:35:55,570
talk on Moore's Law and I asked for a
road map to a path of 100 and after two

00:35:55,570 --> 00:35:55,580
road map to a path of 100 and after two
 

1675
00:35:55,580 --> 00:35:58,090
road map to a path of 100 and after two
weeks they said we only got to fifty a

weeks they said we only got to fifty a
 

1677
00:35:58,100 --> 00:36:00,880

hundred what's a 100 extra hundred

1678
00:36:00,880 --> 00:36:00,890

00:36:03,790 --> 00:36:03,800
shrink we only got 15 I said once you go
 

1681
00:36:03,800 --> 00:36:08,410

to another two weeks well here's the
 

1683
00:36:08,420 --> 00:36:10,060
to another two weeks well here's the
thing about Moore's law right so I

1684
00:36:10,060 --> 00:36:10,070
thing about Moore's law right so I
 

1685
00:36:10,070 --> 00:36:14,260
thing about Moore's law right so I
believe that the next 10 or 20 years of

go up exponentially right right but if
 

1737
00:37:17,180 --> 00:37:19,810
go up exponentially right right but if
you said I know that's coming so now I'm

00:37:24,610 --> 00:37:24,620
maybe you're getting something out of
 

1745
00:37:24,620 --> 00:37:26,230
maybe you're getting something out of
the smaller bricks more strengths inner

1746
00:37:26,230 --> 00:37:26,240
the smaller bricks more strengths inner
 

1747
00:37:26,240 --> 00:37:28,990
the smaller bricks more strengths inner
walls you know less material efficiency

1748
00:37:28,990 --> 00:37:29,000
walls you know less material efficiency
 

1749
00:37:29,000 --> 00:37:31,450

out of that so once you have a roadmap

1750
00:37:31,450 --> 00:37:31,460
out of that so once you have a roadmap
 

1751
00:37:31,460 --> 00:37:33,760
out of that so once you have a roadmap

00:38:47,650 --> 00:38:47,660
teams of a hundred they can know each
 

1817
00:38:47,660 --> 00:38:49,060
teams of a hundred they can know each
other beyond that you have to have

1818
00:38:49,060 --> 00:38:49,070
other beyond that you have to have
 

1819
00:38:49,070 --> 00:38:51,310
other beyond that you have to have
organizational boundaries so you're kind

1820
00:38:51,310 --> 00:38:51,320
organizational boundaries so you're kind
 

1821
00:38:51,320 --> 00:38:52,780
organizational boundaries so you're kind
of you have those are pretty hard

1822
00:38:52,780 --> 00:38:52,790
of you have those are pretty hard
 

1823
00:38:52,790 --> 00:38:55,270
of you have those are pretty hard
constraints all right so then you have

1824
00:38:55,270 --> 00:38:55,280
constraints all right so then you have
 

1825
00:38:55,280 --> 00:38:57,040
constraints all right so then you have
to divide and conquer like as the

1826
00:38:57,040 --> 00:38:57,050
to divide and conquer like as the
 

1827
00:38:57,050 --> 00:38:58,570
to divide and conquer like as the
designs get bigger you have to divide it

1828
00:38:58,570 --> 00:38:58,580
designs get bigger you have to divide it
 

1829
00:38:58,580 --> 00:39:01,210
designs get bigger you have to divide it
into pieces you know that the power of

1830
00:39:01,210 --> 00:39:01,220
into pieces you know that the power of
 

1831
00:39:01,220 --> 00:39:03,280
into pieces you know that the power of
abstraction layers is really high we

1832
00:39:03,280 --> 00:39:03,290
abstraction layers is really high we
 

1833
00:39:03,290 --> 00:39:04,570
abstraction layers is really high we
used to build computers out of

1834
00:39:04,570 --> 00:39:04,580
used to build computers out of
 

1835
00:39:04,580 --> 00:39:06,940
used to build computers out of
transistors now we have a team that

1836
00:39:06,940 --> 00:39:06,950
transistors now we have a team that
 

1837
00:39:06,950 --> 00:39:08,950
transistors now we have a team that
turns transistors and logic cells and

1838
00:39:08,950 --> 00:39:08,960
turns transistors and logic cells and
 

1839
00:39:08,960 --> 00:39:10,300
turns transistors and logic cells and
our team that turns them into functional

1840
00:39:10,300 --> 00:39:10,310
our team that turns them into functional
 

1841
00:39:10,310 --> 00:39:11,530
our team that turns them into functional
you know it's another one it turns in

1842
00:39:11,530 --> 00:39:11,540
you know it's another one it turns in
 

1843
00:39:11,540 --> 00:39:14,230
you know it's another one it turns in
computers right so we have abstraction

1844
00:39:14,230 --> 00:39:14,240
computers right so we have abstraction
 

1845
00:39:14,240 --> 00:39:18,430
computers right so we have abstraction
layers in there and you have to think

1846
00:39:18,430 --> 00:39:18,440
layers in there and you have to think
 

1847
00:39:18,440 --> 00:39:21,400
layers in there and you have to think
about when do you shift gears on that we

1848
00:39:21,400 --> 00:39:21,410
about when do you shift gears on that we
 

1849
00:39:21,410 --> 00:39:22,990
about when do you shift gears on that we
also use faster computers to build

1850
00:39:22,990 --> 00:39:23,000
also use faster computers to build
 

1851
00:39:23,000 --> 00:39:25,570
also use faster computers to build
faster computers so some algorithms run

1852
00:39:25,570 --> 00:39:25,580
faster computers so some algorithms run
 

1853
00:39:25,580 --> 00:39:28,060
faster computers so some algorithms run
twice as fast on new computers but a lot

1854
00:39:28,060 --> 00:39:28,070
twice as fast on new computers but a lot
 

1855
00:39:28,070 --> 00:39:31,450
twice as fast on new computers but a lot
about rhythms are N squared so you know

1856
00:39:31,450 --> 00:39:31,460
about rhythms are N squared so you know
 

1857
00:39:31,460 --> 00:39:32,770
about rhythms are N squared so you know
a computer with twice as many

1858
00:39:32,770 --> 00:39:32,780
a computer with twice as many
 

1859
00:39:32,780 --> 00:39:34,450
a computer with twice as many
transistors and it might take four Tom's

1860
00:39:34,450 --> 00:39:34,460
transistors and it might take four Tom's
 

1861
00:39:34,460 --> 00:39:37,060
transistors and it might take four Tom's
times as long to run so you have to

1862
00:39:37,060 --> 00:39:37,070
times as long to run so you have to
 

1863
00:39:37,070 --> 00:39:39,790
times as long to run so you have to
refactor at the software like simply

1864
00:39:39,790 --> 00:39:39,800
refactor at the software like simply
 

1865
00:39:39,800 --> 00:39:41,470
refactor at the software like simply
using faster computers to build bigger

1866
00:39:41,470 --> 00:39:41,480
using faster computers to build bigger
 

1867
00:39:41,480 --> 00:39:45,250
using faster computers to build bigger
computers doesn't work so so you have to

1868
00:39:45,250 --> 00:39:45,260
computers doesn't work so so you have to
 

1869
00:39:45,260 --> 00:39:46,660
computers doesn't work so so you have to
think about all these things so in terms

1870
00:39:46,660 --> 00:39:46,670
think about all these things so in terms
 

1871
00:39:46,670 --> 00:39:48,250
think about all these things so in terms
of computing performance and the

1872
00:39:48,250 --> 00:39:48,260
of computing performance and the
 

1873
00:39:48,260 --> 00:39:50,230
of computing performance and the
exciting possibility that more powerful

1884
00:40:01,780 --> 00:40:01,790
advancement in performance or is there
 

1885
00:40:01,790 --> 00:40:03,220
advancement in performance or is there
are other directions that you're

1886
00:40:03,220 --> 00:40:03,230
are other directions that you're
 

1887
00:40:03,230 --> 00:40:06,040
are other directions that you're
interested in like like in the direction

1888
00:40:06,040 --> 00:40:06,050
interested in like like in the direction
 

1889
00:40:06,050 --> 00:40:08,560
interested in like like in the direction
of sort of enforcing given parallelism

1890
00:40:08,560 --> 00:40:08,570
of sort of enforcing given parallelism
 

1891
00:40:08,570 --> 00:40:12,220
of sort of enforcing given parallelism
or like doing massive parallelism in

1892
00:40:12,220 --> 00:40:12,230
or like doing massive parallelism in
 

1893
00:40:12,230 --> 00:40:15,160
or like doing massive parallelism in
terms of many many CPUs you know

1894
00:40:15,160 --> 00:40:15,170
terms of many many CPUs you know
 

1895
00:40:15,170 --> 00:40:17,770
terms of many many CPUs you know
stacking CPUs on top of each other that

1896
00:40:17,770 --> 00:40:17,780
stacking CPUs on top of each other that
 

1897
00:40:17,780 --> 00:40:20,020
stacking CPUs on top of each other that
kind of that kind of parallelism or you

1898
00:40:20,020 --> 00:40:20,030
kind of that kind of parallelism or you
 

1899
00:40:20,030 --> 00:40:21,610
kind of that kind of parallelism or you
kind of well think about it a different

1900
00:40:21,610 --> 00:40:21,620
kind of well think about it a different
 

1901
00:40:21,620 --> 00:40:24,580
kind of well think about it a different
way so old computers you know slow

1902
00:40:24,580 --> 00:40:24,590
way so old computers you know slow
 

1903
00:40:24,590 --> 00:40:27,070
way so old computers you know slow
computers you said a equal B plus C

1904
00:40:27,070 --> 00:40:27,080
computers you said a equal B plus C
 

1905
00:40:27,080 --> 00:40:31,510
computers you said a equal B plus C
times D pretty simple right and then we

1906
00:40:31,510 --> 00:40:31,520
times D pretty simple right and then we
 

1907
00:40:31,520 --> 00:40:33,400
times D pretty simple right and then we
made faster computers with vector units

1908
00:40:33,400 --> 00:40:33,410
made faster computers with vector units
 

1909
00:40:33,410 --> 00:40:36,640
made faster computers with vector units
and you can do proper equations and

1910
00:40:36,640 --> 00:40:36,650
and you can do proper equations and
 

1911
00:40:36,650 --> 00:40:40,000
and you can do proper equations and
matrices right and then modern like AI

1912
00:40:40,000 --> 00:40:40,010
matrices right and then modern like AI
 

1913
00:40:40,010 --> 00:40:42,040
matrices right and then modern like AI
computations or like convolutional

1914
00:40:42,040 --> 00:40:42,050
computations or like convolutional
 

1915
00:40:42,050 --> 00:40:44,560
computations or like convolutional
neural networks we you convolve one

1916
00:40:44,560 --> 00:40:44,570
neural networks we you convolve one
 

1917
00:40:44,570 --> 00:40:47,850
neural networks we you convolve one
large data set against another and so

1918
00:40:47,850 --> 00:40:47,860
large data set against another and so
 

1919
00:40:47,860 --> 00:40:49,960
large data set against another and so
there's sort of this hierarchy of

1920
00:40:49,960 --> 00:40:49,970
there's sort of this hierarchy of
 

1921
00:40:49,970 --> 00:40:50,920
there's sort of this hierarchy of
mathematics

1922
00:40:50,920 --> 00:40:50,930
mathematics
 

1923
00:40:50,930 --> 00:40:53,440
mathematics
you know from simple equation to linear

1924
00:40:53,440 --> 00:40:53,450
you know from simple equation to linear
 

1925
00:40:53,450 --> 00:40:56,170
you know from simple equation to linear
equations to matrix equations to it's a

1926
00:40:56,170 --> 00:40:56,180
equations to matrix equations to it's a
 

1927
00:40:56,180 --> 00:40:59,230
equations to matrix equations to it's a
deeper kind of computation and the data

1928
00:40:59,230 --> 00:40:59,240
deeper kind of computation and the data
 

1929
00:40:59,240 --> 00:41:01,090
deeper kind of computation and the data
sets are getting so big that people are

1930
00:41:01,090 --> 00:41:01,100
sets are getting so big that people are
 

1931
00:41:01,100 --> 00:41:03,910
sets are getting so big that people are
thinking of data as a topology problem

1932
00:41:03,910 --> 00:41:03,920
thinking of data as a topology problem
 

1933
00:41:03,920 --> 00:41:06,100
thinking of data as a topology problem
you know data is organized in some

1934
00:41:06,100 --> 00:41:06,110
you know data is organized in some
 

1935
00:41:06,110 --> 00:41:08,860
you know data is organized in some
immense shape and then the computation

1936
00:41:08,860 --> 00:41:08,870
immense shape and then the computation
 

1937
00:41:08,870 --> 00:41:12,040
immense shape and then the computation
which sort of wants to be get data from

1938
00:41:12,040 --> 00:41:12,050
which sort of wants to be get data from
 

1939
00:41:12,050 --> 00:41:14,380
which sort of wants to be get data from
immense shape and do some computation on

1940
00:41:14,380 --> 00:41:14,390
immense shape and do some computation on
 

1941
00:41:14,390 --> 00:41:17,560
immense shape and do some computation on
it so the with computers of a lot of

1942
00:41:17,560 --> 00:41:17,570
it so the with computers of a lot of
 

1943
00:41:17,570 --> 00:41:19,320
it so the with computers of a lot of
people to do is how about rhythms go

1944
00:41:19,320 --> 00:41:19,330
people to do is how about rhythms go
 

1945
00:41:19,330 --> 00:41:23,710
people to do is how about rhythms go
much much further so that that paper you

1946
00:41:23,710 --> 00:41:23,720
much much further so that that paper you
 

1947
00:41:23,720 --> 00:41:26,710
much much further so that that paper you
you reference the Sutton paper they

1948
00:41:26,710 --> 00:41:26,720
you reference the Sutton paper they
 

1949
00:41:26,720 --> 00:41:28,390
you reference the Sutton paper they
talked about you know like in a I

1950
00:41:28,390 --> 00:41:28,400
talked about you know like in a I
 

1951
00:41:28,400 --> 00:41:30,490
talked about you know like in a I
started it was a ploy rule sets to

1952
00:41:30,490 --> 00:41:30,500
started it was a ploy rule sets to
 

1953
00:41:30,500 --> 00:41:32,980
started it was a ploy rule sets to
something that's a very simple

1954
00:41:32,980 --> 00:41:32,990
something that's a very simple
 

1955
00:41:32,990 --> 00:41:36,310
something that's a very simple
computational situation and then when

1956
00:41:36,310 --> 00:41:36,320
computational situation and then when
 

1957
00:41:36,320 --> 00:41:38,650
computational situation and then when
they did first chess thing they solved

1958
00:41:38,650 --> 00:41:38,660
they did first chess thing they solved
 

1959
00:41:38,660 --> 00:41:41,920
they did first chess thing they solved
deep searches so have a huge database of

1960
00:41:41,920 --> 00:41:41,930
deep searches so have a huge database of
 

1961
00:41:41,930 --> 00:41:44,950
deep searches so have a huge database of
moves and results deep search but it's

1962
00:41:44,950 --> 00:41:44,960
moves and results deep search but it's
 

1963
00:41:44,960 --> 00:41:48,940
moves and results deep search but it's
still just a search right now we we take

1964
00:41:48,940 --> 00:41:48,950
still just a search right now we we take
 

1965
00:41:48,950 --> 00:41:52,030
still just a search right now we we take
large numbers of images and we use it to

1966
00:41:52,030 --> 00:41:52,040
large numbers of images and we use it to
 

1967
00:41:52,040 --> 00:41:55,090
large numbers of images and we use it to
Train these weight sets that we convolve

1968
00:41:55,090 --> 00:41:55,100
Train these weight sets that we convolve
 

1969
00:41:55,100 --> 00:41:57,520
Train these weight sets that we convolve
across it's a completely different kind

1970
00:41:57,520 --> 00:41:57,530
across it's a completely different kind
 

1971
00:41:57,530 --> 00:42:00,370
across it's a completely different kind
of phenomena we call that AI now they're

1972
00:42:00,370 --> 00:42:00,380
of phenomena we call that AI now they're
 

1973
00:42:00,380 --> 00:42:02,740
of phenomena we call that AI now they're
doing the next generation and if you

1974
00:42:02,740 --> 00:42:02,750
doing the next generation and if you
 

1975
00:42:02,750 --> 00:42:05,120
doing the next generation and if you
look at it they're going up this mathema

1976
00:42:05,120 --> 00:42:05,130
look at it they're going up this mathema
 

1977
00:42:05,130 --> 00:42:08,870
look at it they're going up this mathema
graph right and then computations the

1978
00:42:08,870 --> 00:42:08,880
graph right and then computations the
 

1979
00:42:08,880 --> 00:42:11,690
graph right and then computations the
both computation and data sets support

1980
00:42:11,690 --> 00:42:11,700
both computation and data sets support
 

1981
00:42:11,700 --> 00:42:14,450
both computation and data sets support
going up that graph yeah the kind of

1982
00:42:14,450 --> 00:42:14,460
going up that graph yeah the kind of
 

1983
00:42:14,460 --> 00:42:16,220
going up that graph yeah the kind of
computation of my I mean I would argue

1984
00:42:16,220 --> 00:42:16,230
computation of my I mean I would argue
 

1985
00:42:16,230 --> 00:42:19,150
computation of my I mean I would argue
that all of it is still a search right

1986
00:42:19,150 --> 00:42:19,160
that all of it is still a search right
 

1987
00:42:19,160 --> 00:42:22,190
that all of it is still a search right
just like you said a topology problems

1988
00:42:22,190 --> 00:42:22,200
just like you said a topology problems
 

1989
00:42:22,200 --> 00:42:24,079
just like you said a topology problems
data says he's searching the data sets

1990
00:42:24,079 --> 00:42:24,089
data says he's searching the data sets
 

1991
00:42:24,089 --> 00:42:28,249
data says he's searching the data sets
for valuable data and also the actual

1992
00:42:28,249 --> 00:42:28,259
for valuable data and also the actual
 

1993
00:42:28,259 --> 00:42:30,440
for valuable data and also the actual
optimization of your networks is a kind

1994
00:42:30,440 --> 00:42:30,450
optimization of your networks is a kind
 

1995
00:42:30,450 --> 00:42:33,559
optimization of your networks is a kind
of search for the I don't know if you

1996
00:42:33,559 --> 00:42:33,569
of search for the I don't know if you
 

1997
00:42:33,569 --> 00:42:35,299
of search for the I don't know if you
looked at the inner layers of finding a

1998
00:42:35,299 --> 00:42:35,309
looked at the inner layers of finding a
 

1999
00:42:35,309 --> 00:42:40,069
looked at the inner layers of finding a
cat it's not a search it's it's a set of

2000
00:42:40,069 --> 00:42:40,079
cat it's not a search it's it's a set of
 

2001
00:42:40,079 --> 00:42:41,960
cat it's not a search it's it's a set of
endless projection so you know

2002
00:42:41,960 --> 00:42:41,970
endless projection so you know
 

2003
00:42:41,970 --> 00:42:43,730
endless projection so you know
projection and here's a shadow of this

2004
00:42:43,730 --> 00:42:43,740
projection and here's a shadow of this
 

2005
00:42:43,740 --> 00:42:46,339
projection and here's a shadow of this
phone yeah right then you can have a

2006
00:42:46,339 --> 00:42:46,349
phone yeah right then you can have a
 

2007
00:42:46,349 --> 00:42:47,990
phone yeah right then you can have a
shadow of that onto something a shadow

2008
00:42:47,990 --> 00:42:48,000
shadow of that onto something a shadow
 

2009
00:42:48,000 --> 00:42:49,940
shadow of that onto something a shadow
on that or something if you look in the

2010
00:42:49,940 --> 00:42:49,950
on that or something if you look in the
 

2011
00:42:49,950 --> 00:42:52,069
on that or something if you look in the
layers you'll see this layer actually

2012
00:42:52,069 --> 00:42:52,079
layers you'll see this layer actually
 

2013
00:42:52,079 --> 00:42:54,499
layers you'll see this layer actually
describes pointy ears and round eyeness

2014
00:42:54,499 --> 00:42:54,509
describes pointy ears and round eyeness
 

2015
00:42:54,509 --> 00:42:58,400
describes pointy ears and round eyeness
and fuzziness and but the computation to

2016
00:42:58,400 --> 00:42:58,410
and fuzziness and but the computation to
 

2017
00:42:58,410 --> 00:43:02,870
and fuzziness and but the computation to
tease out the attributes is not search

2018
00:43:02,870 --> 00:43:02,880
tease out the attributes is not search
 

2019
00:43:02,880 --> 00:43:05,299
tease out the attributes is not search
right ain't like the inference part

2020
00:43:05,299 --> 00:43:05,309
right ain't like the inference part
 

2021
00:43:05,309 --> 00:43:06,799
right ain't like the inference part
might be searched but the trainings not

2022
00:43:06,799 --> 00:43:06,809
might be searched but the trainings not
 

2023
00:43:06,809 --> 00:43:08,720
might be searched but the trainings not
search okay well 10 then in deep

2024
00:43:08,720 --> 00:43:08,730
search okay well 10 then in deep
 

2025
00:43:08,730 --> 00:43:11,029
search okay well 10 then in deep
networks they look at layers and they

2026
00:43:11,029 --> 00:43:11,039
networks they look at layers and they
 

2027
00:43:11,039 --> 00:43:14,720
networks they look at layers and they
don't even know it's represented and yet

2028
00:43:14,720 --> 00:43:14,730
don't even know it's represented and yet
 

2029
00:43:14,730 --> 00:43:16,009
don't even know it's represented and yet
if you take the layers out it doesn't

2030
00:43:16,009 --> 00:43:16,019
if you take the layers out it doesn't
 

2031
00:43:16,019 --> 00:43:18,170
if you take the layers out it doesn't
work ok so if I don't think it's search

2032
00:43:18,170 --> 00:43:18,180
work ok so if I don't think it's search
 

2033
00:43:18,180 --> 00:43:20,269
work ok so if I don't think it's search
all right well but you have to talk to

2034
00:43:20,269 --> 00:43:20,279
all right well but you have to talk to
 

2035
00:43:20,279 --> 00:43:21,440
all right well but you have to talk to
my mathematician about what that

2036
00:43:21,440 --> 00:43:21,450
my mathematician about what that
 

2037
00:43:21,450 --> 00:43:24,970
my mathematician about what that
actually is oh you disagree but the the

2038
00:43:24,970 --> 00:43:24,980
actually is oh you disagree but the the
 

2039
00:43:24,980 --> 00:43:28,309
actually is oh you disagree but the the
it's just semantics I think it's not but

2040
00:43:28,309 --> 00:43:28,319
it's just semantics I think it's not but
 

2041
00:43:28,319 --> 00:43:29,630
it's just semantics I think it's not but
it's certainly not I would say it's

2042
00:43:29,630 --> 00:43:29,640
it's certainly not I would say it's
 

2043
00:43:29,640 --> 00:43:33,710
it's certainly not I would say it's
absolutely not semantics but okay all

2044
00:43:33,710 --> 00:43:33,720
absolutely not semantics but okay all
 

2045
00:43:33,720 --> 00:43:37,160
absolutely not semantics but okay all
right well if you want to go there so

2046
00:43:37,160 --> 00:43:37,170
right well if you want to go there so
 

2047
00:43:37,170 --> 00:43:39,259
right well if you want to go there so
optimization to me is search and we're

2048
00:43:39,259 --> 00:43:39,269
optimization to me is search and we're
 

2049
00:43:39,269 --> 00:43:43,130
optimization to me is search and we're
trying to optimize the ability of a

2050
00:43:43,130 --> 00:43:43,140
trying to optimize the ability of a
 

2051
00:43:43,140 --> 00:43:45,819
trying to optimize the ability of a
neural network to detect cat ears and

2052
00:43:45,819 --> 00:43:45,829
neural network to detect cat ears and
 

2053
00:43:45,829 --> 00:43:49,759
neural network to detect cat ears and
this difference between chess and the

2054
00:43:49,759 --> 00:43:49,769
this difference between chess and the
 

2055
00:43:49,769 --> 00:43:53,900
this difference between chess and the
space the incredibly multi-dimensional

2056
00:43:53,900 --> 00:43:53,910
space the incredibly multi-dimensional
 

2057
00:43:53,910 --> 00:43:56,720
space the incredibly multi-dimensional
hundred thousand dimensional space that

2058
00:43:56,720 --> 00:43:56,730
hundred thousand dimensional space that
 

2059
00:43:56,730 --> 00:43:57,799
hundred thousand dimensional space that
you know networks are trying to optimize

2060
00:43:57,799 --> 00:43:57,809
you know networks are trying to optimize
 

2061
00:43:57,809 --> 00:44:00,680
you know networks are trying to optimize
over is nothing like the chessboard

2062
00:44:00,680 --> 00:44:00,690
over is nothing like the chessboard
 

2063
00:44:00,690 --> 00:44:03,470
over is nothing like the chessboard
database so it's a totally different

2064
00:44:03,470 --> 00:44:03,480
database so it's a totally different
 

2065
00:44:03,480 --> 00:44:05,809
database so it's a totally different
kind of thing and okay in that sense you

2066
00:44:05,809 --> 00:44:05,819
kind of thing and okay in that sense you
 

2067
00:44:05,819 --> 00:44:08,240
kind of thing and okay in that sense you
can say yeah yeah you know I could see

2068
00:44:08,240 --> 00:44:08,250
can say yeah yeah you know I could see
 

2069
00:44:08,250 --> 00:44:11,359
can say yeah yeah you know I could see
how you you might say if if you the

2070
00:44:11,359 --> 00:44:11,369
how you you might say if if you the
 

2071
00:44:11,369 --> 00:44:12,740
how you you might say if if you the
funny thing is it's the difference

2072
00:44:12,740 --> 00:44:12,750
funny thing is it's the difference
 

2073
00:44:12,750 --> 00:44:15,740
funny thing is it's the difference
between given search space and found

2074
00:44:15,740 --> 00:44:15,750
between given search space and found
 

2075
00:44:15,750 --> 00:44:17,930
between given search space and found
search space exactly yeah maybe that's a

2076
00:44:17,930 --> 00:44:17,940
search space exactly yeah maybe that's a
 

2077
00:44:17,940 --> 00:44:18,769
search space exactly yeah maybe that's a
different way

2078
00:44:18,769 --> 00:44:18,779
different way
 

2079
00:44:18,779 --> 00:44:20,630
different way
beautiful but okay but you're saying

2080
00:44:20,630 --> 00:44:20,640
beautiful but okay but you're saying
 

2081
00:44:20,640 --> 00:44:22,640
beautiful but okay but you're saying
what's your sense in terms of the basic

2082
00:44:22,640 --> 00:44:22,650
what's your sense in terms of the basic
 

2083
00:44:22,650 --> 00:44:25,899
what's your sense in terms of the basic
mathematical operations and the

2084
00:44:25,899 --> 00:44:25,909
mathematical operations and the
 

2085
00:44:25,909 --> 00:44:27,739
mathematical operations and the
architectures can be hardwired that

2086
00:44:27,739 --> 00:44:27,749
architectures can be hardwired that
 

2087
00:44:27,749 --> 00:44:31,039
architectures can be hardwired that
enables those operations do you see the

2088
00:44:31,039 --> 00:44:31,049
enables those operations do you see the
 

2089
00:44:31,049 --> 00:44:33,979
enables those operations do you see the
CPUs of today still being a really core

well the operations you know continue to

2096
00:44:40,909 --> 00:44:40,919
well the operations you know continue to
 

2097
00:44:40,919 --> 00:44:43,609
well the operations you know continue to
be add subtract loads or compare and

2098
00:44:43,609 --> 00:44:43,619
be add subtract loads or compare and

00:45:48,529 --> 00:45:48,539
now the quantum researchers think
 

2147
00:45:48,539 --> 00:45:49,849
now the quantum researchers think
they're going to change that radically

they're going to change that radically
and then there's people who think about

00:45:51,380 --> 00:45:51,390
and then there's people who think about
 

2151
00:45:51,390 --> 00:45:52,729
and then there's people who think about
analog computing because you look in the

analog computing because you look in the
 

2153
00:45:52,739 --> 00:45:54,939

you know that maybe there's a way to do
 

2157
00:45:57,359 --> 00:46:00,079
you know that maybe there's a way to do
that more efficiently but we have a

you've answered it but it just asked the
 

2307
00:49:05,579 --> 00:49:07,729
you've answered it but it just asked the
same dumb question over and over so what

2308
00:49:07,729 --> 00:49:07,739
same dumb question over and over so what
 

2309
00:49:07,739 --> 00:49:10,609
same dumb question over and over so what
why do you think Moore's law is not

2310
00:49:10,609 --> 00:49:10,619
why do you think Moore's law is not

00:49:10,619 --> 00:49:14,179
why do you think Moore's law is not
going to die which is the most promising

2312
00:49:14,179 --> 00:49:14,189
going to die which is the most promising

done that's five 10 years so is it that

2316
00:49:19,009 --> 00:49:19,019
done that's five 10 years so is it that
 

2317
00:49:19,019 --> 00:49:20,959
done that's five 10 years so is it that
continues shrinking the transistor or is

2318
00:49:20,959 --> 00:49:20,969
continues shrinking the transistor or is
 

2319
00:49:20,969 --> 00:49:24,199
continues shrinking the transistor or is
it another s-curve that steps in and it

announced what's called nano wires so

2338
00:49:47,569 --> 00:49:47,579
announced what's called nano wires so
 

2339
00:49:47,579 --> 00:49:50,539
announced what's called nano wires so
they they took a fan which had a gate

2340
00:49:50,539 --> 00:49:50,549
they they took a fan which had a gate
 

2341
00:49:50,549 --> 00:49:52,099
they they took a fan which had a gate
around it and turned that into a little

2342
00:49:52,099 --> 00:49:52,109
around it and turned that into a little
 

2343
00:49:52,109 --> 00:49:54,049
around it and turned that into a little
wire so you have better control that and

2344
00:49:54,049 --> 00:49:54,059
wire so you have better control that and
 

2345
00:49:54,059 --> 00:49:55,999
wire so you have better control that and
they're smaller and then from there

2346
00:49:55,999 --> 00:49:56,009
they're smaller and then from there
 

2347
00:49:56,009 --> 00:49:57,679
they're smaller and then from there
there's some obvious steps about how to

00:49:57,679 --> 00:49:57,689
there's some obvious steps about how to
 

2349
00:49:57,689 --> 00:50:01,279
there's some obvious steps about how to
shrink that so the metallurgy around

2350

like somebody's you know people have
 

2675
00:57:12,270 --> 00:57:14,150
like somebody's you know people have
calculated like how many operations does

2676
00:57:14,150 --> 00:57:14,160
calculated like how many operations does
 

2677
00:57:14,160 --> 00:57:16,220
calculated like how many operations does
the brain do and something you know I've

2678
00:57:16,220 --> 00:57:16,230
the brain do and something you know I've
 

2679
00:57:16,230 --> 00:57:17,900
the brain do and something you know I've
seen the number 10 to the 18th about

could you make a computer that did 10 to
 

2685
00:57:22,740 --> 00:57:25,460
could you make a computer that did 10 to
the 20th operations yes sure do you

2686
00:57:25,460 --> 00:57:25,470
the 20th operations yes sure do you
 

2687
00:57:25,470 --> 00:57:28,190
the 20th operations yes sure do you
think we're gonna do that now is there

2688
00:57:28,190 --> 00:57:28,200
think we're gonna do that now is there
 

2689
00:57:28,200 --> 00:57:30,230
think we're gonna do that now is there
something magical about how brains

2690
00:57:30,230 --> 00:57:30,240
something magical about how brains
 

2691
00:57:30,240 --> 00:57:33,260
something magical about how brains
compute things I don't know you know my

2692
00:57:33,260 --> 00:57:33,270
compute things I don't know you know my
 

2693
00:57:33,270 --> 00:57:34,850

personal experiences
 

2695
00:57:34,860 --> 00:57:37,070
personal experiences
interesting cuz you know you think you

2696
00:57:37,070 --> 00:57:37,080
interesting cuz you know you think you
 

2697
00:57:37,080 --> 00:57:38,300
interesting cuz you know you think you
know how you think and then you have all

2698
00:57:38,300 --> 00:57:38,310
know how you think and then you have all
 

2699
00:57:38,310 --> 00:57:39,860
know how you think and then you have all
these ideas and you can't figure out how

2700
00:57:39,860 --> 00:57:39,870
these ideas and you can't figure out how
 

2701
00:57:39,870 --> 00:57:43,670
these ideas and you can't figure out how
they happened and if you meditate you

2702
00:57:43,670 --> 00:57:43,680
they happened and if you meditate you
 

2703
00:57:43,680 --> 00:57:46,730
they happened and if you meditate you
know the like what what you can be aware

2704
00:57:46,730 --> 00:57:46,740
know the like what what you can be aware
 

2705
00:57:46,740 --> 00:57:49,340
know the like what what you can be aware
of is interesting so I don't know if

2706
00:57:49,340 --> 00:57:49,350
of is interesting so I don't know if
 

2707
00:57:49,350 --> 00:57:52,430
of is interesting so I don't know if
brains are magical or not you know the

2708
00:57:52,430 --> 00:57:52,440
brains are magical or not you know the
 

2709
00:57:52,440 --> 00:57:55,100
brains are magical or not you know the
physical evidence says no lots of

2710
00:57:55,100 --> 00:57:55,110
physical evidence says no lots of
 

2711
00:57:55,110 --> 00:57:57,980
physical evidence says no lots of
people's personal experiences yes so

2712
00:57:57,980 --> 00:57:57,990
people's personal experiences yes so
 

2713
00:57:57,990 --> 00:58:00,620
people's personal experiences yes so
what would be funny as if brains are

2714
00:58:00,620 --> 00:58:00,630
what would be funny as if brains are
 

2715
00:58:00,630 --> 00:58:02,690
what would be funny as if brains are
magical and yet we can make brains with

2716
00:58:02,690 --> 00:58:02,700
magical and yet we can make brains with
 

2717
00:58:02,700 --> 00:58:05,180
magical and yet we can make brains with
more computation you know I don't know

2718
00:58:05,180 --> 00:58:05,190
more computation you know I don't know
 

2719
00:58:05,190 --> 00:58:07,340
more computation you know I don't know
what to say about that but what do you

2720
00:58:07,340 --> 00:58:07,350
what to say about that but what do you
 

2721
00:58:07,350 --> 00:58:09,920
what to say about that but what do you
think magic is an emergent phenomena

2722
00:58:09,920 --> 00:58:09,930
think magic is an emergent phenomena
 

2723
00:58:09,930 --> 00:58:13,780
think magic is an emergent phenomena
what would be our than me I don't know

00:58:45,570 --> 00:58:48,770
in a couple of couple of words many
people have observed that organisms run

at lots of different levels right if you

2750
00:58:51,590 --> 00:58:51,600
at lots of different levels right if you
 

2751
00:58:51,600 --> 00:58:53,120
at lots of different levels right if you
got two neurons somebody said you'd have

2752
00:58:53,120 --> 00:58:53,130
got two neurons somebody said you'd have
 

2753
00:58:53,130 --> 00:58:55,300
got two neurons somebody said you'd have
one sensory neuron and one motor neuron

one sensory neuron and one motor neuron
 

2755
00:58:55,310 --> 00:58:58,100
one sensory neuron and one motor neuron
right so we move towards things and away

2756
00:58:58,100 --> 00:58:58,110
right so we move towards things and away
 

2757
00:58:58,110 --> 00:59:00,020
right so we move towards things and away
from things and we have physical

2758
00:59:00,020 --> 00:59:00,030
from things and we have physical
 

2759
00:59:00,030 --> 00:59:02,810
from things and we have physical
integrity and safety or not right and

2760

integrity and safety or not right and
 

2761
00:59:02,820 --> 00:59:05,240
integrity and safety or not right and
then if you look at the animal kingdom

2762
00:59:05,240 --> 00:59:05,250
then if you look at the animal kingdom
 

2763
00:59:05,250 --> 00:59:06,920
then if you look at the animal kingdom
you can see brains that are a little

2764
00:59:06,920 --> 00:59:06,930
you can see brains that are a little
 

2765
00:59:06,930 --> 00:59:08,930
you can see brains that are a little
more complicated and at some point

2766
00:59:08,930 --> 00:59:08,940
more complicated and at some point
 

2767
00:59:08,940 --> 00:59:10,610
more complicated and at some point
there's a planning system and then

2768
00:59:10,610 --> 00:59:10,620
there's a planning system and then
 

2769
00:59:10,620 --> 00:59:12,830
there's a planning system and then
there's an emotional system that's you

2770
00:59:12,830 --> 00:59:12,840
there's an emotional system that's you
 

2771
00:59:12,840 --> 00:59:15,020
there's an emotional system that's you
know happy about being safe or unhappy

2772
00:59:15,020 --> 00:59:15,030
know happy about being safe or unhappy
 

2773
00:59:15,030 --> 00:59:17,570

drives and emotions and we seem to have
 

2783
00:59:28,530 --> 00:59:31,250

00:59:44,160 --> 00:59:46,640
think in a way that those systems are
more independent and you can observe you

I don't know which one's magical I don't
know which ones not computational so is

2802
00:59:56,779 --> 00:59:56,789
know which ones not computational so is
 

2803
00:59:56,789 --> 00:59:58,609
know which ones not computational so is
it possible that it's all computation

2804
00:59:58,609 --> 00:59:58,619
it possible that it's all computation
 

2805
00:59:58,619 --> 01:00:01,429
it possible that it's all computation
probably is there a limit to computation

2806
01:00:01,429 --> 01:00:01,439
probably is there a limit to computation

01:00:01,439 --> 01:00:02,359
probably is there a limit to computation
I don't think so

2808
01:00:02,359 --> 01:00:02,369
I don't think so
 

2809
01:00:02,369 --> 01:00:04,699
I don't think so
do you think the universe is a computer

2810
01:00:04,699 --> 01:00:04,709
do you think the universe is a computer
 

2811
01:00:04,709 --> 01:00:08,029
do you think the universe is a computer
I think he seems to be it's a weird kind

2812
01:00:08,029 --> 01:00:08,039
I think he seems to be it's a weird kind
 

2813
01:00:08,039 --> 01:00:11,319
I think he seems to be it's a weird kind
of computer because if it was a computer

2814
01:00:11,319 --> 01:00:11,329
of computer because if it was a computer
 

2815
01:00:11,329 --> 01:00:14,539
of computer because if it was a computer

right like when they do calculations on
 

2817
01:00:14,549 --> 01:00:17,029
right like when they do calculations on
what it how much calculation it takes to

01:00:17,029 --> 01:00:17,039
what it how much calculation it takes to
 

2819
01:00:17,039 --> 01:00:19,519
what it how much calculation it takes to
describe quantum effects is unbelievably

describe quantum effects is unbelievably
 

2821
01:00:19,529 --> 01:00:22,459
describe quantum effects is unbelievably
high so if it was a computer when you

2822
01:00:22,459 --> 01:00:22,469
high so if it was a computer when you
 

2823
01:00:22,469 --> 01:00:23,659
high so if it was a computer when you
built it out of something that was

2824
01:00:23,659 --> 01:00:23,669
built it out of something that was
 

2825
01:00:23,669 --> 01:00:26,870
built it out of something that was
easier to compute right that's that's a

01:00:26,870 --> 01:00:26,880
easier to compute right that's that's a
 

2827

it's a funny system but then the

it's a funny system but then the
 

2831
01:00:29,969 --> 01:00:31,279

simulation guys have pointed out that
the rules are kind of interesting like

01:00:32,809 --> 01:00:32,819
the rules are kind of interesting like
 

2835
01:00:32,819 --> 01:00:33,949
the rules are kind of interesting like
when you look really close it's

they're both complete failures so that's
 

2939
01:02:30,749 --> 01:02:32,239
they're both complete failures so that's

two thousand years is nothing in the

2947
01:02:39,779 --> 01:02:41,689
two thousand years is nothing in the

2948
01:02:41,689 --> 01:02:41,699
span of the history of the universe so
 

2949
01:02:41,699 --> 01:02:44,179
span of the history of the universe so
we have some time but the next thousand

we have some time but the next thousand
 

2951
01:02:44,189 --> 01:02:47,329
we have some time but the next thousand

years doesn't look good either so that's
 

2953
01:02:47,339 --> 01:02:49,069

01:09:39,330 --> 01:09:39,340
actually essential to driving driving is
 

3281
01:09:39,340 --> 01:09:40,590
actually essential to driving driving is
a lot more complicated than people

3282
01:09:40,590 --> 01:09:40,600
a lot more complicated than people
 

3283
01:09:40,600 --> 01:09:43,380
a lot more complicated than people
realize I think so sort of to push back

3284
01:09:43,380 --> 01:09:43,390
realize I think so sort of to push back
 

3285
01:09:43,390 --> 01:09:46,590
realize I think so sort of to push back
slightly but cut into traffic right yeah

3286
01:09:46,590 --> 01:09:46,600
slightly but cut into traffic right yeah
 

3287
01:09:46,600 --> 01:09:48,540
slightly but cut into traffic right yeah
you can't just wait for a gap you have

3288
01:09:48,540 --> 01:09:48,550
you can't just wait for a gap you have
 

3289
01:09:48,550 --> 01:09:50,520
you can't just wait for a gap you have
to be somewhat aggressive you'd be

3290
01:09:50,520 --> 01:09:50,530
to be somewhat aggressive you'd be
 

3291
01:09:50,530 --> 01:09:52,350
to be somewhat aggressive you'd be
surprised how simple a calculation for

3292
01:09:52,350 --> 01:09:52,360
surprised how simple a calculation for
 

3293
01:09:52,360 --> 01:09:55,020
surprised how simple a calculation for
that is I may be on that particular

3294
01:09:55,020 --> 01:09:55,030
that is I may be on that particular
 

3295
01:09:55,030 --> 01:09:59,430
that is I may be on that particular
point but there's a that it may be asked

3296
01:09:59,430 --> 01:09:59,440
point but there's a that it may be asked
 

3297
01:09:59,440 --> 01:10:01,200
point but there's a that it may be asked
you to push back I would be surprised

3298
01:10:01,200 --> 01:10:01,210
you to push back I would be surprised
 

3299
01:10:01,210 --> 01:10:02,700
you to push back I would be surprised
you know what yeah I'll just say where I

3300
01:10:02,700 --> 01:10:02,710
you know what yeah I'll just say where I
 

3301
01:10:02,710 --> 01:10:04,590
you know what yeah I'll just say where I
stand I would be very surprised but I

3302
01:10:04,590 --> 01:10:04,600
stand I would be very surprised but I
 

3303
01:10:04,600 --> 01:10:07,440
stand I would be very surprised but I
think it's you might be surprised how

3304
01:10:07,440 --> 01:10:07,450
think it's you might be surprised how
 

3305
01:10:07,450 --> 01:10:10,170
think it's you might be surprised how
complicated it is that I'd say that I

3306
01:10:10,170 --> 01:10:10,180
complicated it is that I'd say that I
 

3307
01:10:10,180 --> 01:10:11,940
complicated it is that I'd say that I
tell people's like progress disappoints

3308
01:10:11,940 --> 01:10:11,950
tell people's like progress disappoints
 

3309
01:10:11,950 --> 01:10:13,440
tell people's like progress disappoints
in the short run the surprises in the

3310
01:10:13,440 --> 01:10:13,450
in the short run the surprises in the
 

3311
01:10:13,450 --> 01:10:15,480
in the short run the surprises in the
long run it's very possible yeah I

3312
01:10:15,480 --> 01:10:15,490
long run it's very possible yeah I
 

3313
01:10:15,490 --> 01:10:17,400
long run it's very possible yeah I
suspect in 10 years it'll be just like

3314
01:10:17,400 --> 01:10:17,410
suspect in 10 years it'll be just like
 

3315
01:10:17,410 --> 01:10:20,880
suspect in 10 years it'll be just like
taken for granted yeah but you're

3316
01:10:20,880 --> 01:10:20,890
taken for granted yeah but you're
 

3317
01:10:20,890 --> 01:10:22,260
taken for granted yeah but you're
probably right now look like it's gonna

3318
01:10:22,260 --> 01:10:22,270
probably right now look like it's gonna
 

3319
01:10:22,270 --> 01:10:24,150
probably right now look like it's gonna
be a $50 solution that nobody cares

3320
01:10:24,150 --> 01:10:24,160
be a $50 solution that nobody cares
 

3321
01:10:24,160 --> 01:10:27,330
be a $50 solution that nobody cares
about like GPS is like wow GPS is we

3322
01:10:27,330 --> 01:10:27,340
about like GPS is like wow GPS is we
 

3323
01:10:27,340 --> 01:10:30,000
about like GPS is like wow GPS is we
have satellites in space that tell you

3324
01:10:30,000 --> 01:10:30,010
have satellites in space that tell you
 

3325
01:10:30,010 --> 01:10:31,530
have satellites in space that tell you
where your location is it was a really

3326
01:10:31,530 --> 01:10:31,540
where your location is it was a really
 

3327
01:10:31,540 --> 01:10:33,210
where your location is it was a really
big deal now everything is the GPS I

3328
01:10:33,210 --> 01:10:33,220
big deal now everything is the GPS I
 

3329
01:10:33,220 --> 01:10:35,040
big deal now everything is the GPS I
mean yeah it's true but I do think that

3330
01:10:35,040 --> 01:10:35,050
mean yeah it's true but I do think that
 

3331
01:10:35,050 --> 01:10:38,550
mean yeah it's true but I do think that
systems that involve human behavior are

3332
01:10:38,550 --> 01:10:38,560
systems that involve human behavior are
 

3333
01:10:38,560 --> 01:10:40,200
systems that involve human behavior are
more complicated than we give them

3334
01:10:40,200 --> 01:10:40,210
more complicated than we give them
 

3335
01:10:40,210 --> 01:10:42,150
more complicated than we give them
credit for so we can do incredible

3336
01:10:42,150 --> 01:10:42,160
credit for so we can do incredible
 

3337
01:10:42,160 --> 01:10:43,890
credit for so we can do incredible
things with technology that don't

3338
01:10:43,890 --> 01:10:43,900
things with technology that don't
 

3339
01:10:43,900 --> 01:10:45,990
things with technology that don't
involve humans but when you look humans

3340
01:10:45,990 --> 01:10:46,000
involve humans but when you look humans
 

3341
01:10:46,000 --> 01:10:48,510
involve humans but when you look humans
are less complicated than people you

3342
01:10:48,510 --> 01:10:48,520
are less complicated than people you
 

3343
01:10:48,520 --> 01:10:50,850
are less complicated than people you
know frequently obscure I've maybe I

3344
01:10:50,850 --> 01:10:50,860
know frequently obscure I've maybe I
 

3345
01:10:50,860 --> 01:10:53,100
know frequently obscure I've maybe I
stand off right out of large numbers of

3346
01:10:53,100 --> 01:10:53,110
stand off right out of large numbers of
 

3347
01:10:53,110 --> 01:10:55,270
stand off right out of large numbers of
patterns and just keep doing it over

3348
01:10:55,270 --> 01:10:55,280
patterns and just keep doing it over
 

3349
01:10:55,280 --> 01:10:57,160
patterns and just keep doing it over
but I can't trust you because you're a

3350
01:10:57,160 --> 01:10:57,170
but I can't trust you because you're a
 

3351
01:10:57,170 --> 01:10:59,709
but I can't trust you because you're a
human that's something something a human

3352
01:10:59,709 --> 01:10:59,719
human that's something something a human
 

3353
01:10:59,719 --> 01:11:03,219
human that's something something a human
would say but I might my hope was on the

3354
01:11:03,219 --> 01:11:03,229
would say but I might my hope was on the
 

3355
01:11:03,229 --> 01:11:06,459
would say but I might my hope was on the
point you've made is even if no matter

3356
01:11:06,459 --> 01:11:06,469
point you've made is even if no matter
 

3357
01:11:06,469 --> 01:11:09,790
point you've made is even if no matter
who is right Eve there I'm hoping that

3358
01:11:09,790 --> 01:11:09,800
who is right Eve there I'm hoping that
 

3359
01:11:09,800 --> 01:11:11,020
who is right Eve there I'm hoping that
there's a lot of things that humans

3360
01:11:11,020 --> 01:11:11,030
there's a lot of things that humans
 

3361
01:11:11,030 --> 01:11:12,699
there's a lot of things that humans
aren't good at that machines are

3362
01:11:12,699 --> 01:11:12,709
aren't good at that machines are
 

3363
01:11:12,709 --> 01:11:13,779
aren't good at that machines are
definitely good I like you said

3364
01:11:13,779 --> 01:11:13,789
definitely good I like you said
 

3365
01:11:13,789 --> 01:11:15,759
definitely good I like you said
attention and things like that well

3366
01:11:15,759 --> 01:11:15,769
attention and things like that well
 

3367
01:11:15,769 --> 01:11:17,919
attention and things like that well
they'll be so much better that the

3368
01:11:17,919 --> 01:11:17,929
they'll be so much better that the
 

3369
01:11:17,929 --> 01:11:20,379
they'll be so much better that the
overall picture of safety in autonomy

3370
01:11:20,379 --> 01:11:20,389
overall picture of safety in autonomy
 

3371
01:11:20,389 --> 01:11:22,719
overall picture of safety in autonomy
will be obviously cars will be safer

3372
01:11:22,719 --> 01:11:22,729
will be obviously cars will be safer
 

3373
01:11:22,729 --> 01:11:25,060
will be obviously cars will be safer
even if they're not as good I'm a big

3374
01:11:25,060 --> 01:11:25,070
even if they're not as good I'm a big
 

3375
01:11:25,070 --> 01:11:26,770
even if they're not as good I'm a big
believer in safety I mean there are

3376
01:11:26,770 --> 01:11:26,780
believer in safety I mean there are
 

3377
01:11:26,780 --> 01:11:29,709
believer in safety I mean there are
already the current safety systems like

3378
01:11:29,709 --> 01:11:29,719
already the current safety systems like
 

3379
01:11:29,719 --> 01:11:31,330
already the current safety systems like
cruise control that doesn't let you run

3380
01:11:31,330 --> 01:11:31,340
cruise control that doesn't let you run
 

3381
01:11:31,340 --> 01:11:33,549
cruise control that doesn't let you run
into people and lane-keeping there are

3382
01:11:33,549 --> 01:11:33,559
into people and lane-keeping there are
 

3383
01:11:33,559 --> 01:11:35,620
into people and lane-keeping there are
so many features that you just look at

3384
01:11:35,620 --> 01:11:35,630
so many features that you just look at
 

3385
01:11:35,630 --> 01:11:38,290
so many features that you just look at
the pareto of accidents and knocking off

3386
01:11:38,290 --> 01:11:38,300
the pareto of accidents and knocking off
 

3387
01:11:38,300 --> 01:11:41,680
the pareto of accidents and knocking off
like 80% of them you know super doable

3388
01:11:41,680 --> 01:11:41,690
like 80% of them you know super doable
 

3389
01:11:41,690 --> 01:11:44,529
like 80% of them you know super doable
just a wing guard on the autopilot team

3390
01:11:44,529 --> 01:11:44,539
just a wing guard on the autopilot team
 

3391
01:11:44,539 --> 01:11:48,729
just a wing guard on the autopilot team
and the efforts there the it seems to be

3392
01:11:48,729 --> 01:11:48,739
and the efforts there the it seems to be
 

3393
01:11:48,739 --> 01:11:51,819
and the efforts there the it seems to be
that there's a very intense scrutiny by

3394
01:11:51,819 --> 01:11:51,829
that there's a very intense scrutiny by
 

3395
01:11:51,829 --> 01:11:53,709
that there's a very intense scrutiny by
the media and the public in terms of

3396
01:11:53,709 --> 01:11:53,719
the media and the public in terms of
 

3397
01:11:53,719 --> 01:11:56,140
the media and the public in terms of
safety the pressure the bar but before

3398
01:11:56,140 --> 01:11:56,150
safety the pressure the bar but before
 

3399
01:11:56,150 --> 01:11:59,290
safety the pressure the bar but before
autonomous vehicles what are your sort

3400
01:11:59,290 --> 01:11:59,300
autonomous vehicles what are your sort
 

3401
01:11:59,300 --> 01:12:02,259
autonomous vehicles what are your sort
of as a person they're working on the

3402
01:12:02,259 --> 01:12:02,269
of as a person they're working on the
 

3403
01:12:02,269 --> 01:12:03,580
of as a person they're working on the
hardware and trying to build a system

3404
01:12:03,580 --> 01:12:03,590
hardware and trying to build a system
 

3405
01:12:03,590 --> 01:12:06,339
hardware and trying to build a system
that builds a safe vehicle and so on

3406
01:12:06,339 --> 01:12:06,349
that builds a safe vehicle and so on
 

3407
01:12:06,349 --> 01:12:08,589
that builds a safe vehicle and so on
what was your sense about that pressure

3408
01:12:08,589 --> 01:12:08,599
what was your sense about that pressure
 

3409
01:12:08,599 --> 01:12:10,930
what was your sense about that pressure
is it unfair is it expected of new

3410
01:12:10,930 --> 01:12:10,940
is it unfair is it expected of new
 

3411
01:12:10,940 --> 01:12:13,779
is it unfair is it expected of new
technology it seems reasonable I was

3412
01:12:13,779 --> 01:12:13,789
technology it seems reasonable I was
 

3413
01:12:13,789 --> 01:12:15,520
technology it seems reasonable I was
interested I talked to both American and

3414
01:12:15,520 --> 01:12:15,530
interested I talked to both American and
 

3415
01:12:15,530 --> 01:12:18,160
interested I talked to both American and
European regulators and I was worried

3416
01:12:18,160 --> 01:12:18,170
European regulators and I was worried
 

3417
01:12:18,170 --> 01:12:22,089
European regulators and I was worried
that the regulations would write into

3418
01:12:22,089 --> 01:12:22,099
that the regulations would write into
 

3419
01:12:22,099 --> 01:12:25,270
that the regulations would write into
the rules technology solutions like

3420
01:12:25,270 --> 01:12:25,280
the rules technology solutions like
 

3421
01:12:25,280 --> 01:12:28,600
the rules technology solutions like
modern brake systems imply hydraulic

3422
01:12:28,600 --> 01:12:28,610
modern brake systems imply hydraulic
 

3423
01:12:28,610 --> 01:12:31,479
modern brake systems imply hydraulic
brakes so if you'll read the regulations

3424
01:12:31,479 --> 01:12:31,489
brakes so if you'll read the regulations
 

3425
01:12:31,489 --> 01:12:34,120
brakes so if you'll read the regulations
to meet the letter of the law for brakes

3426
01:12:34,120 --> 01:12:34,130
to meet the letter of the law for brakes
 

3427
01:12:34,130 --> 01:12:37,350
to meet the letter of the law for brakes
it sort of has to be hydraulic right and

3428
01:12:37,350 --> 01:12:37,360
it sort of has to be hydraulic right and
 

3429
01:12:37,360 --> 01:12:40,000
it sort of has to be hydraulic right and
the regulator said there they're

3430
01:12:40,000 --> 01:12:40,010
the regulator said there they're
 

3431
01:12:40,010 --> 01:12:42,189
the regulator said there they're
interested in the use cases like a

3432
01:12:42,189 --> 01:12:42,199
interested in the use cases like a
 

3433
01:12:42,199 --> 01:12:44,709

that's craftsmen's work right you may be
a genius craftsman because you have the

3622
01:16:36,040 --> 01:16:36,050
a genius craftsman because you have the
 

3623
01:16:36,050 --> 01:16:37,660
a genius craftsman because you have the
best techniques and you discover a new

and humans really like to do that you

3628
01:16:43,600 --> 01:16:43,610
and humans really like to do that you
 

3629
01:16:43,610 --> 01:16:47,350
and humans really like to do that you
know smart humans oh no everybody oh I

know I used to I dug ditches when I was

3632
01:16:49,420 --> 01:16:49,430
know I used to I dug ditches when I was
 

3633
01:16:49,430 --> 01:16:51,189
know I used to I dug ditches when I was
in college I got really good at it

3634
01:16:51,189 --> 01:16:51,199
in college I got really good at it
 

3635
01:16:51,199 --> 01:16:54,400
in college I got really good at it
satisfying yeah so digging ditches is

01:16:54,400 --> 01:16:54,410
satisfying yeah so digging ditches is
 

3637
01:16:54,410 --> 01:16:56,560

also craft malware yeah of course

3638
01:16:56,560 --> 01:16:56,570
also craft malware yeah of course
 

3639
01:16:56,570 --> 01:16:58,750
also craft malware yeah of course
so so there's an expression called

3640
01:16:58,750 --> 01:16:58,760
so so there's an expression called
 

3641
01:16:58,760 --> 01:17:01,209
so so there's an expression called
complex mastery behavior so when you're

learning something that's fun because
 

3645
01:17:02,510 --> 01:17:04,450
learning something that's fun because
you're learning something when you do

you're learning something when you do
 

3647
01:17:04,460 --> 01:17:05,800
you're learning something when you do
something that's wrote and simple it's

01:17:05,810 --> 01:17:07,600
something that's wrote and simple it's
not that satisfying but if the steps

01:17:07,600 --> 01:17:07,610
not that satisfying but if the steps
 

3651
01:17:07,610 --> 01:17:09,970
not that satisfying but if the steps
that you have to do or complicate it and

01:17:09,970 --> 01:17:09,980
that you have to do or complicate it and
 

3653
01:17:09,980 --> 01:17:12,820
that you have to do or complicate it and
you're good at them it's satisfying to

01:17:12,820 --> 01:17:12,830
you're good at them it's satisfying to
 

3655
01:17:12,830 --> 01:17:16,150
you're good at them it's satisfying to
do them and then if you're intrigued by

it all as you're doing them you
 

3659
01:17:17,780 --> 01:17:19,900
it all as you're doing them you
sometimes learn new things that you can

3745
01:18:49,579 --> 01:18:52,419
complicated putting cars together is
hard right and in the cars moving and

3746
01:18:52,419 --> 01:18:52,429
hard right and in the cars moving and
 

3747
01:18:52,429 --> 01:18:53,979
hard right and in the cars moving and
the parts are moving and sometimes the

3748
01:18:53,979 --> 01:18:53,989
the parts are moving and sometimes the
 

3749
01:18:53,989 --> 01:18:55,779
the parts are moving and sometimes the
parts are damaged and you have to

3750
01:18:55,779 --> 01:18:55,789
parts are damaged and you have to
 

3751
01:18:55,789 --> 01:18:56,979
parts are damaged and you have to
coordinate putting all the stuff

3752
01:18:56,979 --> 01:18:56,989
coordinate putting all the stuff
 

3753
01:18:56,989 --> 01:18:58,509
coordinate putting all the stuff
together and people are good at it

3754
01:18:58,509 --> 01:18:58,519
together and people are good at it
 

3755
01:18:58,519 --> 01:19:01,060
together and people are good at it
they're good at it and I remember one

3756
01:19:01,060 --> 01:19:01,070
they're good at it and I remember one
 

3757
01:19:01,070 --> 01:19:02,979
they're good at it and I remember one
day I went to work and the line was shut

3758
01:19:02,979 --> 01:19:02,989
day I went to work and the line was shut
 

3759
01:19:02,989 --> 01:19:04,899
day I went to work and the line was shut
down for some reason and then some of

3760
01:19:04,899 --> 01:19:04,909
down for some reason and then some of
 

3761
01:19:04,909 --> 01:19:06,339
down for some reason and then some of
the guys sitting around were really

3762
01:19:06,339 --> 01:19:06,349
the guys sitting around were really
 

3763
01:19:06,349 --> 01:19:08,379
the guys sitting around were really
bummed because they they had reorganized

3764
01:19:08,379 --> 01:19:08,389
bummed because they they had reorganized
 

3765
01:19:08,389 --> 01:19:09,819
bummed because they they had reorganized
a bunch of stuff and they were gonna hit

3766
01:19:09,819 --> 01:19:09,829
a bunch of stuff and they were gonna hit
 

3767
01:19:09,829 --> 01:19:11,319
a bunch of stuff and they were gonna hit
a new record for the number of cars

3768
01:19:11,319 --> 01:19:11,329
a new record for the number of cars
 

3769
01:19:11,329 --> 01:19:13,629
a new record for the number of cars
built that day and they were all gung ho

3770
01:19:13,629 --> 01:19:13,639
built that day and they were all gung ho
 

3771
01:19:13,639 --> 01:19:15,069
built that day and they were all gung ho
to do it and these were big tough

3772
01:19:15,069 --> 01:19:15,079
to do it and these were big tough
 

3773
01:19:15,079 --> 01:19:18,339
to do it and these were big tough
buggers yeah you know but what they did

3774
01:19:18,339 --> 01:19:18,349
buggers yeah you know but what they did
 

3775
01:19:18,349 --> 01:19:20,020
buggers yeah you know but what they did
was complicated and you couldn't do it

3776
01:19:20,020 --> 01:19:20,030
was complicated and you couldn't do it
 

3777
01:19:20,030 --> 01:19:22,419
was complicated and you couldn't do it
yeah and I mean well after a while you

3778
01:19:22,419 --> 01:19:22,429
yeah and I mean well after a while you
 

3779
01:19:22,429 --> 01:19:23,890
yeah and I mean well after a while you
could but you'd have to work your way up

3780
01:19:23,890 --> 01:19:23,900
could but you'd have to work your way up
 

3781
01:19:23,900 --> 01:19:26,680
could but you'd have to work your way up
cuz you know like putting a bright

3782
01:19:26,680 --> 01:19:26,690
cuz you know like putting a bright
 

3783
01:19:26,690 --> 01:19:29,049
cuz you know like putting a bright
what's called the bright stuff at the

3784
01:19:29,049 --> 01:19:29,059
what's called the bright stuff at the
 

3785
01:19:29,059 --> 01:19:30,279
what's called the bright stuff at the
trim on a car

3786
01:19:30,279 --> 01:19:30,289
trim on a car
 

3787
01:19:30,289 --> 01:19:33,009
trim on a car
on a moving assembly line where it has

3788
01:19:33,009 --> 01:19:33,019
on a moving assembly line where it has
 

3789
01:19:33,019 --> 01:19:35,140
on a moving assembly line where it has
to be attached 25 places in a minute and

3790
01:19:35,140 --> 01:19:35,150
to be attached 25 places in a minute and
 

3791
01:19:35,150 --> 01:19:38,729
to be attached 25 places in a minute and
a half is unbelievably complicated and

3792
01:19:38,729 --> 01:19:38,739
a half is unbelievably complicated and
 

3793
01:19:38,739 --> 01:19:41,799
a half is unbelievably complicated and
and and human beings can do it's really

3794
01:19:41,799 --> 01:19:41,809
and and human beings can do it's really
 

3795
01:19:41,809 --> 01:19:42,160
and and human beings can do it's really
good

3796
01:19:42,160 --> 01:19:42,170
good
 

3797
01:19:42,170 --> 01:19:43,629
good
I think that's harder than driving a car

3798
01:19:43,629 --> 01:19:43,639
I think that's harder than driving a car
 

3799
01:19:43,639 --> 01:19:46,450
I think that's harder than driving a car
by the way putting together working

3800
01:19:46,450 --> 01:19:46,460
by the way putting together working
 

3801
01:19:46,460 --> 01:19:49,840
by the way putting together working
working on the factory to smart

3802
01:19:49,840 --> 01:19:49,850
working on the factory to smart
 

3803
01:19:49,850 --> 01:19:52,660
working on the factory to smart
people can disagree yeah I think drive

3804
01:19:52,660 --> 01:19:52,670
people can disagree yeah I think drive
 

3805
01:19:52,670 --> 01:19:55,270
people can disagree yeah I think drive
driving a car will get you in the

3806
01:19:55,270 --> 01:19:55,280
driving a car will get you in the
 

3807
01:19:55,280 --> 01:19:57,490
driving a car will get you in the
factory something will see you're not

factory something will see you're not
 

3809
01:19:57,500 --> 01:19:59,590
factory something will see you're not
for us humans driving a car is easy I'm

3810
01:19:59,590 --> 01:19:59,600
for us humans driving a car is easy I'm
 

3811
01:19:59,600 --> 01:20:02,560
for us humans driving a car is easy I'm
saying building a machine that drives a

car is not easy
 

3815
01:20:04,130 --> 01:20:07,360
car is not easy
ok ok driving a car is easy for humans

3816
01:20:07,360 --> 01:20:07,370
ok ok driving a car is easy for humans
 

3817
01:20:07,370 --> 01:20:10,120
ok ok driving a car is easy for humans

yeah yeah intrigued by your you know
your anthropology yeah it says we have

3830
01:20:27,970 --> 01:20:27,980
your anthropology yeah it says we have
 

3831
01:20:27,980 --> 01:20:29,290
your anthropology yeah it says we have
to go dig into that there's some

3832
01:20:29,290 --> 01:20:29,300
to go dig into that there's some
 

3833

I had a friend he invented a better

3866
01:21:22,390 --> 01:21:22,400
I had a friend he invented a better
 

3867
01:21:22,400 --> 01:21:25,360
I had a friend he invented a better
electric motor and it was like a lot

3868
01:21:25,360 --> 01:21:25,370
electric motor and it was like a lot
 

3869
01:21:25,370 --> 01:21:27,250
electric motor and it was like a lot
better than what we were using and one

3870
01:21:27,250 --> 01:21:27,260
better than what we were using and one
 

3871
01:21:27,260 --> 01:21:29,110
better than what we were using and one
day he came by he said you know I'm a

he the guy you built the motor yeah
 

3885
01:21:42,140 --> 01:21:46,630
he the guy you built the motor yeah
probably not you know like like the but

3886
01:21:46,630 --> 01:21:46,640
probably not you know like like the but
 

3887
01:21:46,640 --> 01:21:48,700
probably not you know like like the but
doing interesting work that's both

3888
01:21:48,700 --> 01:21:48,710
doing interesting work that's both
 

3889
01:21:48,710 --> 01:21:50,380
doing interesting work that's both
innovative and let's say craftsmen's

3890
01:21:50,380 --> 01:21:50,390
innovative and let's say craftsmen's
 

3891
01:21:50,390 --> 01:21:52,300
innovative and let's say craftsmen's
work on the current thing it's really

3892
01:21:52,300 --> 01:21:52,310
work on the current thing it's really
 

3893
01:21:52,310 --> 01:21:54,940
work on the current thing it's really
satisfying it's good and and that's cool

3894
01:21:54,940 --> 01:21:54,950
satisfying it's good and and that's cool
 

3895
01:21:54,950 --> 01:21:58,450
satisfying it's good and and that's cool
and then Elon was good taking everything

3896
01:21:58,450 --> 01:21:58,460
and then Elon was good taking everything
 

3897
01:21:58,460 --> 01:22:00,310
and then Elon was good taking everything
apart and like what's the deep first

3898
01:22:00,310 --> 01:22:00,320
apart and like what's the deep first
 

3899
01:22:00,320 --> 01:22:03,189
apart and like what's the deep first
principle oh no what's really

3900
01:22:03,189 --> 01:22:03,199
principle oh no what's really
 

3901
01:22:03,199 --> 01:22:05,410
principle oh no what's really
what's really you know you know you know

3902
01:22:05,410 --> 01:22:05,420
what's really you know you know you know
 

3903
01:22:05,420 --> 01:22:08,080
what's really you know you know you know
that that you know ability to look at it

3904
01:22:08,080 --> 01:22:08,090
that that you know ability to look at it
 

3905
01:22:08,090 --> 01:22:10,750
that that you know ability to look at it
without assumptions and and how

3906
01:22:10,750 --> 01:22:10,760
without assumptions and and how
 

3907
01:22:10,760 --> 01:22:14,560
without assumptions and and how
constraints is super wild you know we

3908
01:22:14,560 --> 01:22:14,570
constraints is super wild you know we
 

3909
01:22:14,570 --> 01:22:17,470
constraints is super wild you know we
build rocket ship and using the same car

3910
01:22:17,470 --> 01:22:17,480
build rocket ship and using the same car
 

3911
01:22:17,480 --> 01:22:20,770
build rocket ship and using the same car
you know everything and that's super fun

3912
01:22:20,770 --> 01:22:20,780
you know everything and that's super fun
 

3913
01:22:20,780 --> 01:22:22,870
you know everything and that's super fun
and he's into it too like when they

3914
01:22:22,870 --> 01:22:22,880
and he's into it too like when they
 

3915
01:22:22,880 --> 01:22:25,229
and he's into it too like when they
first landed to SpaceX Rockets at Tesla

3916
01:22:25,229 --> 01:22:25,239
first landed to SpaceX Rockets at Tesla
 

3917
01:22:25,239 --> 01:22:27,820
first landed to SpaceX Rockets at Tesla
we had a video projector in the big room

3918
01:22:27,820 --> 01:22:27,830
we had a video projector in the big room
 

3919
01:22:27,830 --> 01:22:29,680
we had a video projector in the big room
and like five hundred people came down

3920
01:22:29,680 --> 01:22:29,690
and like five hundred people came down
 

3921
01:22:29,690 --> 01:22:31,180
and like five hundred people came down
and when they landed everybody cheered

3922
01:22:31,180 --> 01:22:31,190
and when they landed everybody cheered
 

3923
01:22:31,190 --> 01:22:33,930
and when they landed everybody cheered
and some people cried it was so cool

3924
01:22:33,930 --> 01:22:33,940
and some people cried it was so cool
 

3925
01:22:33,940 --> 01:22:38,410
and some people cried it was so cool
alright but how did you do that well it

3926
01:22:38,410 --> 01:22:38,420
alright but how did you do that well it
 

3927
01:22:38,420 --> 01:22:41,229
alright but how did you do that well it
was super hard and then people say well

3928
01:22:41,229 --> 01:22:41,239
was super hard and then people say well
 

3929
01:22:41,239 --> 01:22:43,810
was super hard and then people say well
it's chaotic really to get out of all

3930
01:22:43,810 --> 01:22:43,820
it's chaotic really to get out of all
 

3931
01:22:43,820 --> 01:22:45,340
it's chaotic really to get out of all
your assumptions you think that's not

3932
01:22:45,340 --> 01:22:45,350
your assumptions you think that's not
 

3933
01:22:45,350 --> 01:22:48,310
your assumptions you think that's not
going to be unbelievably painful and

3934
01:22:48,310 --> 01:22:48,320
going to be unbelievably painful and
 

3935
01:22:48,320 --> 01:22:50,950
going to be unbelievably painful and
there's Elon tough yeah probably the

3936
01:22:50,950 --> 01:22:50,960
there's Elon tough yeah probably the
 

3937
01:22:50,960 --> 01:22:54,910
there's Elon tough yeah probably the
people look back on it and say boy I'm

3938
01:22:54,910 --> 01:22:54,920
people look back on it and say boy I'm
 

3939
01:22:54,920 --> 01:22:58,169
people look back on it and say boy I'm
really happy I had that experience to go

3940
01:22:58,169 --> 01:22:58,179
really happy I had that experience to go
 

3941
01:22:58,179 --> 01:23:00,669
really happy I had that experience to go
take apart that many layers of

3942
01:23:00,669 --> 01:23:00,679
take apart that many layers of
 

3943
01:23:00,679 --> 01:23:02,280
take apart that many layers of
assumptions

3944
01:23:02,280 --> 01:23:02,290
assumptions
 

3945
01:23:02,290 --> 01:23:05,470
assumptions
sometimes super fun sometimes painful so

3946
01:23:05,470 --> 01:23:05,480
sometimes super fun sometimes painful so
 

3947
01:23:05,480 --> 01:23:06,550
sometimes super fun sometimes painful so
it could be emotionally and

3948
01:23:06,550 --> 01:23:06,560
it could be emotionally and
 

3949
01:23:06,560 --> 01:23:08,260
it could be emotionally and
intellectually painful that whole

3950
01:23:08,260 --> 01:23:08,270
intellectually painful that whole
 

3951
01:23:08,270 --> 01:23:10,120
intellectually painful that whole
process just stripping away assumptions

3952
01:23:10,120 --> 01:23:10,130
process just stripping away assumptions
 

3953
01:23:10,130 --> 01:23:12,760
process just stripping away assumptions
yeah I imagine 99% of your thought

3954
01:23:12,760 --> 01:23:12,770
yeah I imagine 99% of your thought
 

3955
01:23:12,770 --> 01:23:14,530
yeah I imagine 99% of your thought
process is protecting your self

3956
01:23:14,530 --> 01:23:14,540
process is protecting your self
 

3957
01:23:14,540 --> 01:23:19,900
process is protecting your self
conception and 98% of that's wrong yeah

3958
01:23:19,900 --> 01:23:19,910
conception and 98% of that's wrong yeah
 

3959
01:23:19,910 --> 01:23:22,750
conception and 98% of that's wrong yeah
now you got there math right no you

3960
01:23:22,750 --> 01:23:22,760
now you got there math right no you
 

3961
01:23:22,760 --> 01:23:24,189
now you got there math right no you
think your feeling when you get back

3962
01:23:24,189 --> 01:23:24,199
think your feeling when you get back
 

3963
01:23:24,199 --> 01:23:27,100
think your feeling when you get back
into that one bit that's useful and now

3964
01:23:27,100 --> 01:23:27,110
into that one bit that's useful and now
 

3965
01:23:27,110 --> 01:23:28,570
into that one bit that's useful and now
you're open and you have the ability to

3966
01:23:28,570 --> 01:23:28,580
you're open and you have the ability to
 

3967
01:23:28,580 --> 01:23:32,979
you're open and you have the ability to
do something different I don't know if I

3968
01:23:32,979 --> 01:23:32,989
do something different I don't know if I
 

3969
01:23:32,989 --> 01:23:34,209
do something different I don't know if I
got the math right it might be ninety

3970
01:23:34,209 --> 01:23:34,219
got the math right it might be ninety
 

3971
01:23:34,219 --> 01:23:39,430
got the math right it might be ninety
nine point nine but in 850 imagining it

3972
01:23:39,430 --> 01:23:39,440
nine point nine but in 850 imagining it
 

3973
01:23:39,440 --> 01:23:44,620
nine point nine but in 850 imagining it
the 50% is hard enough yeah now for a

3974
01:23:44,620 --> 01:23:44,630
the 50% is hard enough yeah now for a
 

3975
01:23:44,630 --> 01:23:46,270
the 50% is hard enough yeah now for a
long time I've suspected you could get

3976
01:23:46,270 --> 01:23:46,280
long time I've suspected you could get
 

3977
01:23:46,280 --> 01:23:49,840
long time I've suspected you could get
better look you can think better you can

3978
01:23:49,840 --> 01:23:49,850
better look you can think better you can
 

3979
01:23:49,850 --> 01:23:51,370
better look you can think better you can
think more clearly you can take things

3980
01:23:51,370 --> 01:23:51,380
think more clearly you can take things
 

3981
01:23:51,380 --> 01:23:54,010
think more clearly you can take things
apart and there's lots of examples of

3982
01:23:54,010 --> 01:23:54,020
apart and there's lots of examples of
 

3983
01:23:54,020 --> 01:23:59,650
apart and there's lots of examples of
that people who do that so any line is

3984
01:23:59,650 --> 01:23:59,660
that people who do that so any line is
 

3985
01:23:59,660 --> 01:24:02,110
that people who do that so any line is
an example of that parent or an example

3986
01:24:02,110 --> 01:24:02,120
an example of that parent or an example
 

3987
01:24:02,120 --> 01:24:05,970
an example of that parent or an example
says you know if I am I'm fun to talk to

3988
01:24:05,970 --> 01:24:05,980
says you know if I am I'm fun to talk to
 

3989
01:24:05,980 --> 01:24:07,990
says you know if I am I'm fun to talk to
certainly I've learned a lot of stuff

3990
01:24:07,990 --> 01:24:08,000
certainly I've learned a lot of stuff
 

3991
01:24:08,000 --> 01:24:10,000
certainly I've learned a lot of stuff
right well here's the other thing it's

3992
01:24:10,000 --> 01:24:10,010
right well here's the other thing it's
 

3993
01:24:10,010 --> 01:24:13,060
right well here's the other thing it's
like I talk like like I read books and

3994
01:24:13,060 --> 01:24:13,070
like I talk like like I read books and
 

3995
01:24:13,070 --> 01:24:15,070
like I talk like like I read books and
people think oh you read books well no I

3996
01:24:15,070 --> 01:24:15,080
people think oh you read books well no I
 

3997
01:24:15,080 --> 01:24:16,600
people think oh you read books well no I
brought a couple books

3998
01:24:16,600 --> 01:24:16,610
brought a couple books
 

3999
01:24:16,610 --> 01:24:19,800
brought a couple books
awake for 55 years

4000
01:24:19,800 --> 01:24:19,810
awake for 55 years
 

4001
01:24:19,810 --> 01:24:22,330
awake for 55 years
well maybe 50 cuz I didn't read learned

4002
01:24:22,330 --> 01:24:22,340
well maybe 50 cuz I didn't read learned
 

4003
01:24:22,340 --> 01:24:27,220
well maybe 50 cuz I didn't read learned
read tall as H or something and and it

4004
01:24:27,220 --> 01:24:27,230
read tall as H or something and and it
 

4005
01:24:27,230 --> 01:24:28,570
read tall as H or something and and it
turns out when people write books they

4006
01:24:28,570 --> 01:24:28,580
turns out when people write books they
 

4007
01:24:28,580 --> 01:24:31,390
turns out when people write books they
often take 20 years of their life where

4008
01:24:31,390 --> 01:24:31,400
often take 20 years of their life where
 

4009
01:24:31,400 --> 01:24:33,610
often take 20 years of their life where
they passionately did something reduce

4010
01:24:33,610 --> 01:24:33,620
they passionately did something reduce
 

4011
01:24:33,620 --> 01:24:36,730
they passionately did something reduce
it to to 200 pages that's kind of fun

4012
01:24:36,730 --> 01:24:36,740
it to to 200 pages that's kind of fun
 

4013
01:24:36,740 --> 01:24:39,130
it to to 200 pages that's kind of fun
and then the goat you go online and you

4014
01:24:39,130 --> 01:24:39,140
and then the goat you go online and you
 

4015
01:24:39,140 --> 01:24:40,870
and then the goat you go online and you
can find out who wrote the best books

4016
01:24:40,870 --> 01:24:40,880
can find out who wrote the best books
 

4017
01:24:40,880 --> 01:24:42,910
can find out who wrote the best books
and who like you know that's kind of

4018
01:24:42,910 --> 01:24:42,920
and who like you know that's kind of
 

4019
01:24:42,920 --> 01:24:44,710
and who like you know that's kind of
Alda so there's this wild selection

4020
01:24:44,710 --> 01:24:44,720
Alda so there's this wild selection
 

4021
01:24:44,720 --> 01:24:47,170
Alda so there's this wild selection
process and then you can read it and for

4022
01:24:47,170 --> 01:24:47,180
process and then you can read it and for
 

4023
01:24:47,180 --> 01:24:50,080
process and then you can read it and for
the most part to understand it and then

4024
01:24:50,080 --> 01:24:50,090
the most part to understand it and then
 

4025
01:24:50,090 --> 01:24:52,510
the most part to understand it and then
you can go apply it like I went to one

4026
01:24:52,510 --> 01:24:52,520
you can go apply it like I went to one
 

4027
01:24:52,520 --> 01:24:54,010
you can go apply it like I went to one
company and I thought I haven't managed

4028
01:24:54,010 --> 01:24:54,020
company and I thought I haven't managed
 

4029
01:24:54,020 --> 01:24:56,230
company and I thought I haven't managed
much before so I read 20 management

4030
01:24:56,230 --> 01:24:56,240
much before so I read 20 management
 

4031
01:24:56,240 --> 01:24:58,600
much before so I read 20 management
books and I started talking to him

4032
01:24:58,600 --> 01:24:58,610
books and I started talking to him
 

4033
01:24:58,610 --> 01:25:00,490
books and I started talking to him
basically compared to all the VP's

4034
01:25:00,490 --> 01:25:00,500
basically compared to all the VP's
 

4035
01:25:00,500 --> 01:25:03,220
basically compared to all the VP's
running around I'd run night read 19

4036
01:25:03,220 --> 01:25:03,230
running around I'd run night read 19
 

4037
01:25:03,230 --> 01:25:06,210
running around I'd run night read 19
more management books than anybody else

4038
01:25:06,210 --> 01:25:06,220
more management books than anybody else
 

4039
01:25:06,220 --> 01:25:08,110
more management books than anybody else
was it even that hard

4040
01:25:08,110 --> 01:25:08,120
was it even that hard
 

4041
01:25:08,120 --> 01:25:10,420
was it even that hard
yeah and a half the stuff worked like

4042
01:25:10,420 --> 01:25:10,430
yeah and a half the stuff worked like
 

4043
01:25:10,430 --> 01:25:12,340
yeah and a half the stuff worked like
first time it wasn't even rocket science

4044
01:25:12,340 --> 01:25:12,350
first time it wasn't even rocket science
 

4045
01:25:12,350 --> 01:25:15,460
first time it wasn't even rocket science
but at the core of that is questioning

4046
01:25:15,460 --> 01:25:15,470
but at the core of that is questioning
 

4047
01:25:15,470 --> 01:25:18,570
but at the core of that is questioning
the assumptions okay sort of entering

4048
01:25:18,570 --> 01:25:18,580
the assumptions okay sort of entering
 

4049
01:25:18,580 --> 01:25:21,670
the assumptions okay sort of entering
the thinking first principles thinking

4050
01:25:21,670 --> 01:25:21,680
the thinking first principles thinking
 

4051
01:25:21,680 --> 01:25:24,190
the thinking first principles thinking
sort of looking at the reality of the

4093
01:26:10,970 --> 01:26:14,860
what you do for a while that's kind of
cool so just as the last question your

sense from the big picture from the
 

4097
01:26:17,570 --> 01:26:20,650
sense from the big picture from the
first principles do you think you kind

4098
01:26:20,650 --> 01:26:20,660
first principles do you think you kind
 

4099
01:26:20,660 --> 01:26:23,260
first principles do you think you kind
of answered already but do you think

4100
01:26:23,260 --> 01:26:23,270
of answered already but do you think

getting solved like that the data side
 

4153
01:27:32,580 --> 01:27:34,550
getting solved like that the data side
is really powerful but I disagree with

4154
01:27:34,550 --> 01:27:34,560
is really powerful but I disagree with
 

4155
01:27:34,560 --> 01:27:36,530
is really powerful but I disagree with
both you and you and I'll tell you and

4156
01:27:36,530 --> 01:27:36,540
both you and you and I'll tell you and
 

4157
01:27:36,540 --> 01:27:39,410
both you and you and I'll tell you and
once again as I did before that that

01:27:39,410 --> 01:27:39,420
once again as I did before that that
 

4159
01:27:39,420 --> 01:27:41,570

problem it's something more complicated
 

4165
01:27:47,160 --> 01:27:50,780

for whatever reasons human beings are
 

4311
01:30:48,990 --> 01:30:51,530
for whatever reasons human beings are
and that's a creative tension in

4312
01:30:51,530 --> 01:30:51,540
and that's a creative tension in
 

4313
01:30:51,540 --> 01:30:53,429
and that's a creative tension in
opposition with both are good and

bad forces like there's lots of
 

4317
01:30:56,139 --> 01:30:58,790
bad forces like there's lots of
philosophical understandings of that

4318

philosophical understandings of that
 

4319
01:30:58,800 --> 01:31:01,709
philosophical understandings of that
right I don't know why that would be

4320
01:31:01,709 --> 01:31:01,719
right I don't know why that would be
 

4321
01:31:01,719 --> 01:31:04,529
right I don't know why that would be
different so you think the evils is

4322
01:31:04,529 --> 01:31:04,539
different so you think the evils is
 

4323
01:31:04,539 --> 01:31:07,080
different so you think the evils is
necessary for the good I mean the

4324
01:31:07,080 --> 01:31:07,090
necessary for the good I mean the
 

4325
01:31:07,090 --> 01:31:09,959
necessary for the good I mean the
tension I don't know about evil but like

4326
01:31:09,959 --> 01:31:09,969
tension I don't know about evil but like
 

4327
01:31:09,969 --> 01:31:11,759
tension I don't know about evil but like
we live in a competitive world where

4328
01:31:11,759 --> 01:31:11,769
we live in a competitive world where
 

4329
01:31:11,769 --> 01:31:15,209
we live in a competitive world where
your good is somebody else's you know

4330

your good is somebody else's you know
 

4331
01:31:15,219 --> 01:31:18,149
your good is somebody else's you know
evil you know there's there's the

4332
01:31:18,149 --> 01:31:18,159
evil you know there's there's the
 

4333
01:31:18,159 --> 01:31:20,429
evil you know there's there's the
malignant part of it but that seems to

4334
01:31:20,429 --> 01:31:20,439
malignant part of it but that seems to
 

4335
01:31:20,439 --> 01:31:23,580
malignant part of it but that seems to
be self-limiting although occasionally

4336
01:31:23,580 --> 01:31:23,590
be self-limiting although occasionally
 

4337
01:31:23,590 --> 01:31:27,870
be self-limiting although occasionally
it's it's super horrible but yeah look

4338
01:31:27,870 --> 01:31:27,880
it's it's super horrible but yeah look
 

4339
01:31:27,880 --> 01:31:30,239
it's it's super horrible but yeah look
there's a debate over ideas and some

4340
01:31:30,239 --> 01:31:30,249
there's a debate over ideas and some
 

4341
01:31:30,249 --> 01:31:32,609
there's a debate over ideas and some
people have different beliefs and that

4342
01:31:32,609 --> 01:31:32,619
people have different beliefs and that
 

4343
01:31:32,619 --> 01:31:34,859
people have different beliefs and that
that debate itself is a process so the

4344
01:31:34,859 --> 01:31:34,869
that debate itself is a process so the
 

4345
01:31:34,869 --> 01:31:37,799
that debate itself is a process so the
at arriving at something you know I

4346
01:31:37,799 --> 01:31:37,809
at arriving at something you know I
 

4347
01:31:37,809 --> 01:31:41,819
at arriving at something you know I
wouldn't continue yeah just you but you

4348
01:31:41,819 --> 01:31:41,829
wouldn't continue yeah just you but you
 

4349
01:31:41,829 --> 01:31:43,259
wouldn't continue yeah just you but you
don't think that whole process will

4350
01:31:43,259 --> 01:31:43,269
don't think that whole process will
 

4351
01:31:43,269 --> 01:31:45,299
don't think that whole process will
leave humans behind in a way that's

4352
01:31:45,299 --> 01:31:45,309
leave humans behind in a way that's
 

4353
01:31:45,309 --> 01:31:46,100
leave humans behind in a way that's
painful

4354
01:31:46,100 --> 01:31:46,110
painful
 

4355
01:31:46,110 --> 01:31:48,959
painful
an emotionally painful yes for the one

4356
01:31:48,959 --> 01:31:48,969
an emotionally painful yes for the one
 

4357
01:31:48,969 --> 01:31:50,729
an emotionally painful yes for the one
for the point one percent they'll be

4358
01:31:50,729 --> 01:31:50,739
for the point one percent they'll be
 

4359
01:31:50,739 --> 01:31:52,500
for the point one percent they'll be
there why isn't it already painful for a

4360
01:31:52,500 --> 01:31:52,510
there why isn't it already painful for a
 

4361
01:31:52,510 --> 01:31:54,209
there why isn't it already painful for a
large percentage of the population and

4362
01:31:54,209 --> 01:31:54,219
large percentage of the population and
 

4363
01:31:54,219 --> 01:31:56,250
large percentage of the population and
it is I mean Society does have a lot of

4364
01:31:56,250 --> 01:31:56,260
it is I mean Society does have a lot of
 

4365
01:31:56,260 --> 01:31:59,459
it is I mean Society does have a lot of
