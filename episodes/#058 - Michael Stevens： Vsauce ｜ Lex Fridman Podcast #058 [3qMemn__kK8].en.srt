00:03:22,950 --> 00:03:25,640
the position and velocity of every
single you know quantum state in a brain

166
00:03:25,640 --> 00:03:25,650
single you know quantum state in a brain
 

167
00:03:25,650 --> 00:03:31,009
single you know quantum state in a brain
probably but I think that if we you know

168
00:03:31,009 --> 00:03:31,019
probably but I think that if we you know
 

169
00:03:31,019 --> 00:03:33,050
probably but I think that if we you know
can get to that point with psychology

170
00:03:33,050 --> 00:03:33,060
can get to that point with psychology
 

171
00:03:33,060 --> 00:03:36,100
can get to that point with psychology
then we can start to think about

172
00:03:36,100 --> 00:03:36,110
then we can start to think about
 

173
00:03:36,110 --> 00:03:39,039
then we can start to think about
consciousness in a physical and and

174
00:03:39,039 --> 00:03:39,049
consciousness in a physical and and
 

175
00:03:39,049 --> 00:03:41,570
consciousness in a physical and and
mathematical way when we ask questions

176
00:03:41,570 --> 00:03:41,580
mathematical way when we ask questions
 

177
00:03:41,580 --> 00:03:45,140
mathematical way when we ask questions
like well what is self reference how can

178
00:03:45,140 --> 00:03:45,150
like well what is self reference how can
 

179
00:03:45,150 --> 00:03:47,479
like well what is self reference how can
you think about yourself thinking what

180
00:03:47,479 --> 00:03:47,489
you think about yourself thinking what
 

181
00:03:47,489 --> 00:03:49,660
you think about yourself thinking what
are some mathematical structures that

182
00:03:49,660 --> 00:03:49,670
are some mathematical structures that
 

183
00:03:49,670 --> 00:03:53,300
are some mathematical structures that
could bring that about there's ideas of

184
00:03:53,300 --> 00:03:53,310
could bring that about there's ideas of
 

185
00:03:53,310 --> 00:03:56,539
could bring that about there's ideas of
in terms of consciousness and breaking

186
00:03:56,539 --> 00:03:56,549
in terms of consciousness and breaking
 

187
00:03:56,549 --> 00:04:00,050
in terms of consciousness and breaking
it down into a physics there's ideas of

188
00:04:00,050 --> 00:04:00,060
it down into a physics there's ideas of
 

189
00:04:00,060 --> 00:04:02,680
it down into a physics there's ideas of
pants like ism where people believe that

190
00:04:02,680 --> 00:04:02,690
pants like ism where people believe that
 

191
00:04:02,690 --> 00:04:04,970
pants like ism where people believe that
whatever consciousness is is a

192
00:04:04,970 --> 00:04:04,980
whatever consciousness is is a
 

193
00:04:04,980 --> 00:04:07,819
whatever consciousness is is a
fundamental part of reality it's almost

194
00:04:07,819 --> 00:04:07,829
fundamental part of reality it's almost
 

195
00:04:07,829 --> 00:04:10,039
fundamental part of reality it's almost
like a physics law do you think what's

196
00:04:10,039 --> 00:04:10,049
like a physics law do you think what's
 

197
00:04:10,049 --> 00:04:11,990
like a physics law do you think what's
your views on consciousness do you think

198
00:04:11,990 --> 00:04:12,000
your views on consciousness do you think
 

199
00:04:12,000 --> 00:04:15,710
your views on consciousness do you think
it has this this deep part of reality or

200
00:04:15,710 --> 00:04:15,720
it has this this deep part of reality or
 

201
00:04:15,720 --> 00:04:17,930
it has this this deep part of reality or
is it something that's deeply human and

202
00:04:17,930 --> 00:04:17,940
is it something that's deeply human and
 

203
00:04:17,940 --> 00:04:22,520
is it something that's deeply human and
constructed by us humans start nice and

204
00:04:22,520 --> 00:04:22,530
constructed by us humans start nice and
 

205
00:04:22,530 --> 00:04:25,640
constructed by us humans start nice and
light yeah an easy easy I think I asked

206
00:04:25,640 --> 00:04:25,650
light yeah an easy easy I think I asked
 

207
00:04:25,650 --> 00:04:26,830
light yeah an easy easy I think I asked
you today has

208
00:04:26,830 --> 00:04:26,840
you today has
 

209
00:04:26,840 --> 00:04:28,620
you today has
actually proven answer so yeah

210
00:04:28,620 --> 00:04:28,630
actually proven answer so yeah
 

211
00:04:28,630 --> 00:04:30,520
actually proven answer so yeah
hypothesis so yeah I mean I should

212
00:04:30,520 --> 00:04:30,530
hypothesis so yeah I mean I should
 

213
00:04:30,530 --> 00:04:33,040
hypothesis so yeah I mean I should
clarify this is all speculation yeah and

214
00:04:33,040 --> 00:04:33,050
clarify this is all speculation yeah and
 

215
00:04:33,050 --> 00:04:34,390
clarify this is all speculation yeah and
I'm not an expert in any of these talk

216
00:04:34,390 --> 00:04:34,400
I'm not an expert in any of these talk
 

217
00:04:34,400 --> 00:04:37,570
I'm not an expert in any of these talk
to topics and I'm not God but I think

218
00:04:37,570 --> 00:04:37,580
to topics and I'm not God but I think
 

219
00:04:37,580 --> 00:04:42,750
to topics and I'm not God but I think
that consciousness is probably um

220
00:04:42,750 --> 00:04:42,760
that consciousness is probably um
 

221
00:04:42,760 --> 00:04:45,490
that consciousness is probably um
something that can be fully explained

222
00:04:45,490 --> 00:04:45,500
something that can be fully explained
 

223
00:04:45,500 --> 00:04:49,330
something that can be fully explained
within the laws of physics I think that

224
00:04:49,330 --> 00:04:49,340
within the laws of physics I think that
 

225
00:04:49,340 --> 00:04:51,969
within the laws of physics I think that
our you know bodies and brains and and

226
00:04:51,969 --> 00:04:51,979
our you know bodies and brains and and
 

227
00:04:51,979 --> 00:04:54,040
our you know bodies and brains and and
the universe and and at the quantum

228
00:04:54,040 --> 00:04:54,050
the universe and and at the quantum
 

229
00:04:54,050 --> 00:04:56,129
the universe and and at the quantum
level is so rich and complex

230
00:04:56,129 --> 00:04:56,139
level is so rich and complex
 

231
00:04:56,139 --> 00:04:58,510
level is so rich and complex
I'd be surprised if we couldn't find a

232
00:04:58,510 --> 00:04:58,520
I'd be surprised if we couldn't find a
 

233
00:04:58,520 --> 00:05:02,440
I'd be surprised if we couldn't find a
room for consciousness there and why

234
00:05:02,440 --> 00:05:02,450
room for consciousness there and why
 

235
00:05:02,450 --> 00:05:05,770
room for consciousness there and why
should we be conscious why are we aware

236
00:05:05,770 --> 00:05:05,780
should we be conscious why are we aware
 

237
00:05:05,780 --> 00:05:10,510
should we be conscious why are we aware
of ourselves that is a very strange and

238
00:05:10,510 --> 00:05:10,520
of ourselves that is a very strange and
 

239
00:05:10,520 --> 00:05:12,879
of ourselves that is a very strange and
interesting and important question and I

240
00:05:12,879 --> 00:05:12,889
interesting and important question and I
 

241
00:05:12,889 --> 00:05:15,370
interesting and important question and I
think for the next few thousand years

242
00:05:15,370 --> 00:05:15,380
think for the next few thousand years
 

243
00:05:15,380 --> 00:05:17,710
think for the next few thousand years
we're going to have to believe in

244
00:05:17,710 --> 00:05:17,720
we're going to have to believe in
 

245
00:05:17,720 --> 00:05:22,390
we're going to have to believe in
answers purely on faith but my guess is

246
00:05:22,390 --> 00:05:22,400
answers purely on faith but my guess is
 

247
00:05:22,400 --> 00:05:25,300
answers purely on faith but my guess is
that we will find that you know within

248
00:05:25,300 --> 00:05:25,310
that we will find that you know within
 

249
00:05:25,310 --> 00:05:27,820
that we will find that you know within
the configuration space of possible

250
00:05:27,820 --> 00:05:27,830
the configuration space of possible
 

251
00:05:27,830 --> 00:05:30,189
the configuration space of possible
arrangements of the universe there are

252
00:05:30,189 --> 00:05:30,199
arrangements of the universe there are
 

253
00:05:30,199 --> 00:05:33,659
arrangements of the universe there are
some that contain memories of others

254
00:05:33,659 --> 00:05:33,669
some that contain memories of others
 

255
00:05:33,669 --> 00:05:36,820
some that contain memories of others
literally uh Julian Barbour calls them

256
00:05:36,820 --> 00:05:36,830
literally uh Julian Barbour calls them
 

257
00:05:36,830 --> 00:05:38,620
literally uh Julian Barbour calls them
time capsule states where you're like

258
00:05:38,620 --> 00:05:38,630
time capsule states where you're like
 

259
00:05:38,630 --> 00:05:40,629
time capsule states where you're like
yeah not only do I have a scratch on my

260
00:05:40,629 --> 00:05:40,639
yeah not only do I have a scratch on my
 

261
00:05:40,639 --> 00:05:43,029
yeah not only do I have a scratch on my
arm but also this state of the universe

262
00:05:43,029 --> 00:05:43,039
arm but also this state of the universe
 

263
00:05:43,039 --> 00:05:45,640
arm but also this state of the universe
also contains a memory in my head of

264
00:05:45,640 --> 00:05:45,650
also contains a memory in my head of
 

265
00:05:45,650 --> 00:05:47,770
also contains a memory in my head of
being scratched by my cat three days ago

266
00:05:47,770 --> 00:05:47,780
being scratched by my cat three days ago
 

267
00:05:47,780 --> 00:05:51,070
being scratched by my cat three days ago
and for some reason those kinds of

268
00:05:51,070 --> 00:05:51,080
and for some reason those kinds of
 

269
00:05:51,080 --> 00:05:53,440
and for some reason those kinds of
states of the universe are more

270
00:05:53,440 --> 00:05:53,450
states of the universe are more
 

271
00:05:53,450 --> 00:05:56,230
states of the universe are more
plentiful or more likely when you say

272
00:05:56,230 --> 00:05:56,240
plentiful or more likely when you say
 

273
00:05:56,240 --> 00:05:58,180
plentiful or more likely when you say
those states the ones would that contain

274
00:05:58,180 --> 00:05:58,190
those states the ones would that contain
 

275
00:05:58,190 --> 00:06:01,240
those states the ones would that contain
memories of its past or ones that

276
00:06:01,240 --> 00:06:01,250
memories of its past or ones that
 

277
00:06:01,250 --> 00:06:03,250
memories of its past or ones that
contain memories of its past and have

278
00:06:03,250 --> 00:06:03,260
contain memories of its past and have
 

279
00:06:03,260 --> 00:06:06,100
contain memories of its past and have
degrees of consciousness just the first

280
00:06:06,100 --> 00:06:06,110
degrees of consciousness just the first
 

281
00:06:06,110 --> 00:06:07,839
degrees of consciousness just the first
part because the I think the

282
00:06:07,839 --> 00:06:07,849
part because the I think the
 

283
00:06:07,849 --> 00:06:11,290
part because the I think the
consciousness then emerges from the fact

284
00:06:11,290 --> 00:06:11,300
consciousness then emerges from the fact
 

285
00:06:11,300 --> 00:06:13,270
consciousness then emerges from the fact
that a state of the universe that

286
00:06:13,270 --> 00:06:13,280
that a state of the universe that
 

287
00:06:13,280 --> 00:06:17,620
that a state of the universe that
contains fragments or memories of other

288
00:06:17,620 --> 00:06:17,630
contains fragments or memories of other
 

289
00:06:17,630 --> 00:06:20,920
contains fragments or memories of other
states is one where you're going to feel

290
00:06:20,920 --> 00:06:20,930
states is one where you're going to feel
 

291
00:06:20,930 --> 00:06:23,170
states is one where you're going to feel
like there's time you're going to feel

292
00:06:23,170 --> 00:06:23,180
like there's time you're going to feel
 

293
00:06:23,180 --> 00:06:25,390
like there's time you're going to feel
like yeah things in the happened in the

294
00:06:25,390 --> 00:06:25,400
like yeah things in the happened in the
 

295
00:06:25,400 --> 00:06:27,520
like yeah things in the happened in the
past and I don't know what'll happen in

296
00:06:27,520 --> 00:06:27,530
past and I don't know what'll happen in
 

297
00:06:27,530 --> 00:06:28,810
past and I don't know what'll happen in
the future because these states don't

298
00:06:28,810 --> 00:06:28,820
the future because these states don't
 

299
00:06:28,820 --> 00:06:30,400
the future because these states don't
contain information about the future for

300
00:06:30,400 --> 00:06:30,410
contain information about the future for
 

301
00:06:30,410 --> 00:06:33,760
contain information about the future for
some reason those kind of states are

302
00:06:33,760 --> 00:06:33,770
some reason those kind of states are
 

303
00:06:33,770 --> 00:06:38,860
some reason those kind of states are
either more common more plentiful or you

304
00:06:38,860 --> 00:06:38,870
either more common more plentiful or you
 

305
00:06:38,870 --> 00:06:40,200
either more common more plentiful or you
could use the anthropic principle

306
00:06:40,200 --> 00:06:40,210
could use the anthropic principle
 

307
00:06:40,210 --> 00:06:42,600
could use the anthropic principle
just say well they're extremely rare but

308
00:06:42,600 --> 00:06:42,610
just say well they're extremely rare but
 

309
00:06:42,610 --> 00:06:45,120
just say well they're extremely rare but
until you are in one or if you are in

310
00:06:45,120 --> 00:06:45,130
until you are in one or if you are in
 

311
00:06:45,130 --> 00:06:47,129
until you are in one or if you are in
one then you can ask questions like you

312
00:06:47,129 --> 00:06:47,139
one then you can ask questions like you
 

313
00:06:47,139 --> 00:06:49,980
one then you can ask questions like you
you're asking me on this podcast slide

314
00:06:49,980 --> 00:06:49,990
you're asking me on this podcast slide
 

315
00:06:49,990 --> 00:06:51,809
you're asking me on this podcast slide
questions but yeah it's like what why

316
00:06:51,809 --> 00:06:51,819
questions but yeah it's like what why
 

317
00:06:51,819 --> 00:06:53,070
questions but yeah it's like what why
are we conscious well because if we

318
00:06:53,070 --> 00:06:53,080
are we conscious well because if we
 

319
00:06:53,080 --> 00:06:54,719
are we conscious well because if we
weren't we wouldn't be asking why we

320
00:06:54,719 --> 00:06:54,729
weren't we wouldn't be asking why we
 

321
00:06:54,729 --> 00:06:58,170
weren't we wouldn't be asking why we
were you've kind of implied that you

322
00:06:58,170 --> 00:06:58,180
were you've kind of implied that you
 

323
00:06:58,180 --> 00:07:02,189
were you've kind of implied that you

at the end of the day what would the
 

437
00:09:29,470 --> 00:09:32,370
at the end of the day what would the

it'll be a dead cat right but if it's
 

443
00:09:36,280 --> 00:09:39,150
it'll be a dead cat right but if it's
not even a real cat then it's just like

00:09:39,150 --> 00:09:39,160
not even a real cat then it's just like
 

445
00:09:39,160 --> 00:09:42,030
not even a real cat then it's just like
a video game cat and right so what's the

a video game cat and right so what's the
 

447
00:09:42,040 --> 00:09:44,190
a video game cat and right so what's the

00:10:20,620 --> 00:10:24,300
extremely useful as a thought experiment
because it makes sense to everyone

480
00:10:24,300 --> 00:10:24,310
because it makes sense to everyone
 

481
00:10:24,310 --> 00:10:27,420
because it makes sense to everyone
especially as we see virtual reality and

482
00:10:27,420 --> 00:10:27,430
especially as we see virtual reality and
 

483
00:10:27,430 --> 00:10:29,580
especially as we see virtual reality and

00:10:31,320 --> 00:10:31,330
complex you're not talking to an

00:10:34,020 --> 00:10:34,030
audience in like Newton's time where
 

489
00:10:34,030 --> 00:10:36,990
audience in like Newton's time where
you're like imagine a clock that it has

490
00:10:36,990 --> 00:10:37,000
you're like imagine a clock that it has
 

491
00:10:37,000 --> 00:10:38,820
you're like imagine a clock that it has
mechanics in it that are so complex that

great the thought experiment of do we

506
00:10:59,280 --> 00:10:59,290
great the thought experiment of do we
 

507
00:10:59,290 --> 00:11:01,170
great the thought experiment of do we
live in a simulation am i a brain and a

live on earth and that I have a body and
 

517
00:11:12,019 --> 00:11:13,900
live on earth and that I have a body and
all of this and the fact that you can't

518
00:11:13,900 --> 00:11:13,910
all of this and the fact that you can't
 

519
00:11:13,910 --> 00:11:16,689
all of this and the fact that you can't
prove it either way is a fantastic way

520
00:11:16,689 --> 00:11:16,699
prove it either way is a fantastic way
 

521
00:11:16,699 --> 00:11:17,949
prove it either way is a fantastic way
to introduce people to some of the

522
00:11:17,949 --> 00:11:17,959
to introduce people to some of the
 

523
00:11:17,959 --> 00:11:22,420
to introduce people to some of the
deepest questions so you mentioned a

524
00:11:22,420 --> 00:11:22,430
deepest questions so you mentioned a
 

525
00:11:22,430 --> 00:11:23,769
deepest questions so you mentioned a
little buddy that you would want to

526
00:11:23,769 --> 00:11:23,779
little buddy that you would want to
 

527
00:11:23,779 --> 00:11:26,530
little buddy that you would want to
cancel an appointment with so that's a

00:11:26,530 --> 00:11:26,540
cancel an appointment with so that's a
 

529
00:11:26,540 --> 00:11:28,210
cancel an appointment with so that's a
lot of our conversations that's where my

00:11:28,210 --> 00:11:28,220
lot of our conversations that's where my
 

531
00:11:28,220 --> 00:11:32,290
lot of our conversations that's where my
research is artificial intelligence and

532
00:11:32,290 --> 00:11:32,300
research is artificial intelligence and
 

533
00:11:32,300 --> 00:11:34,329
research is artificial intelligence and
I apologize but you're such a fun person

I apologize but you're such a fun person
to ask these big questions with well I

536
00:11:37,179 --> 00:11:37,189
to ask these big questions with well I
 

537
00:11:37,189 --> 00:11:38,800
to ask these big questions with well I
hope I could give some answers that are

538
00:11:38,800 --> 00:11:38,810
hope I could give some answers that are
 

539
00:11:38,810 --> 00:11:42,220
hope I could give some answers that are
interesting well because because of

540
00:11:42,220 --> 00:11:42,230
interesting well because because of
 

541
00:11:42,230 --> 00:11:45,220
interesting well because because of
you've sharpened your brain's ability to

542
00:11:45,220 --> 00:11:45,230
you've sharpened your brain's ability to
 

543
00:11:45,230 --> 00:11:47,499
you've sharpened your brain's ability to
explore some of the most some of the

544
00:11:47,499 --> 00:11:47,509
explore some of the most some of the
 

545
00:11:47,509 --> 00:11:49,420
explore some of the most some of the
questions then many signs is actually

546
00:11:49,420 --> 00:11:49,430
questions then many signs is actually
 

547
00:11:49,430 --> 00:11:51,429
questions then many signs is actually
afraid of even touching which is

548
00:11:51,429 --> 00:11:51,439
afraid of even touching which is
 

549
00:11:51,439 --> 00:11:53,410
afraid of even touching which is
fascinating and I think you're in that

550
00:11:53,410 --> 00:11:53,420
fascinating and I think you're in that
 

551
00:11:53,420 --> 00:11:55,800
fascinating and I think you're in that
sense ultimately a great scientist

552
00:11:55,800 --> 00:11:55,810
sense ultimately a great scientist
 

553
00:11:55,810 --> 00:11:58,360
sense ultimately a great scientist
through this process of sharpening your

554
00:11:58,360 --> 00:11:58,370
through this process of sharpening your
 

555
00:11:58,370 --> 00:12:00,400
through this process of sharpening your
brain well I don't know if I am a

556
00:12:00,400 --> 00:12:00,410
brain well I don't know if I am a
 

557
00:12:00,410 --> 00:12:03,579
brain well I don't know if I am a
scientist I think you know science is a

558
00:12:03,579 --> 00:12:03,589
scientist I think you know science is a
 

559
00:12:03,589 --> 00:12:07,629
scientist I think you know science is a
way of knowing and there are a lot of

560
00:12:07,629 --> 00:12:07,639
way of knowing and there are a lot of
 

561
00:12:07,639 --> 00:12:09,970
way of knowing and there are a lot of
questions I investigate that are not

562
00:12:09,970 --> 00:12:09,980
questions I investigate that are not
 

563
00:12:09,980 --> 00:12:13,090
questions I investigate that are not
scientific questions on like minefield

564
00:12:13,090 --> 00:12:13,100
scientific questions on like minefield
 

565
00:12:13,100 --> 00:12:14,800
scientific questions on like minefield
we have definitely done scientific

566
00:12:14,800 --> 00:12:14,810
we have definitely done scientific
 

567
00:12:14,810 --> 00:12:16,929
we have definitely done scientific
experiments and studies that had

568
00:12:16,929 --> 00:12:16,939
experiments and studies that had
 

569
00:12:16,939 --> 00:12:20,439
experiments and studies that had
hypotheses and all that but you know not

570
00:12:20,439 --> 00:12:20,449
hypotheses and all that but you know not
 

571
00:12:20,449 --> 00:12:22,780
hypotheses and all that but you know not
to be too like Precious about what does

572
00:12:22,780 --> 00:12:22,790
to be too like Precious about what does
 

573
00:12:22,790 --> 00:12:25,629
to be too like Precious about what does
the word science mean but I think I

574
00:12:25,629 --> 00:12:25,639
the word science mean but I think I
 

575
00:12:25,639 --> 00:12:27,249
the word science mean but I think I
would just describe myself as curious

576
00:12:27,249 --> 00:12:27,259
would just describe myself as curious
 

577
00:12:27,259 --> 00:12:28,870
would just describe myself as curious
and I hope that that curiosity is

578
00:12:28,870 --> 00:12:28,880
and I hope that that curiosity is
 

579
00:12:28,880 --> 00:12:31,120
and I hope that that curiosity is
contagious so to you the scientific

580
00:12:31,120 --> 00:12:31,130
contagious so to you the scientific
 

581
00:12:31,130 --> 00:12:33,309
contagious so to you the scientific
method is deeply connected to science

582
00:12:33,309 --> 00:12:33,319
method is deeply connected to science
 

583
00:12:33,319 --> 00:12:35,970
method is deeply connected to science
because your curiosity took you to

584
00:12:35,970 --> 00:12:35,980
because your curiosity took you to
 

585
00:12:35,980 --> 00:12:39,759
because your curiosity took you to
asking questions to me asking a good

586
00:12:39,759 --> 00:12:39,769
asking questions to me asking a good
 

587
00:12:39,769 --> 00:12:41,220
asking questions to me asking a good
question

588
00:12:41,220 --> 00:12:41,230
question
 

589
00:12:41,230 --> 00:12:44,740
question
even if you feel society feels that it's

590
00:12:44,740 --> 00:12:44,750
even if you feel society feels that it's
 

591
00:12:44,750 --> 00:12:45,970
even if you feel society feels that it's
not a question within the reach of

592
00:12:45,970 --> 00:12:45,980
not a question within the reach of
 

593
00:12:45,980 --> 00:12:48,309
not a question within the reach of
science currently to me that asking the

594
00:12:48,309 --> 00:12:48,319
science currently to me that asking the
 

595
00:12:48,319 --> 00:12:51,939
science currently to me that asking the
question is the biggest step of the

596
00:12:51,939 --> 00:12:51,949
question is the biggest step of the
 

597
00:12:51,949 --> 00:12:54,309
question is the biggest step of the
scientific process the scientific method

598
00:12:54,309 --> 00:12:54,319
scientific process the scientific method
 

599
00:12:54,319 --> 00:12:58,210
scientific process the scientific method
is the second part and that may be what

600
00:12:58,210 --> 00:12:58,220
is the second part and that may be what
 

601
00:12:58,220 --> 00:12:59,650
is the second part and that may be what
traditionally is called science but to

602
00:12:59,650 --> 00:12:59,660
traditionally is called science but to
 

603
00:12:59,660 --> 00:13:01,360
traditionally is called science but to
me asking the questions being brave

604
00:13:01,360 --> 00:13:01,370
me asking the questions being brave
 

605
00:13:01,370 --> 00:13:03,280
me asking the questions being brave
enough to ask the questions being

606
00:13:03,280 --> 00:13:03,290
enough to ask the questions being
 

607
00:13:03,290 --> 00:13:05,350
enough to ask the questions being
curious and not constrained by what

608
00:13:05,350 --> 00:13:05,360
curious and not constrained by what
 

609
00:13:05,360 --> 00:13:09,699
curious and not constrained by what
you're supposed to think is is just true

610
00:13:09,699 --> 00:13:09,709
you're supposed to think is is just true
 

611
00:13:09,709 --> 00:13:11,379
you're supposed to think is is just true
or what it means to be a scientist to me

612
00:13:11,379 --> 00:13:11,389
or what it means to be a scientist to me
 

613
00:13:11,389 --> 00:13:14,259
or what it means to be a scientist to me
it's certainly a huge part of what it

614
00:13:14,259 --> 00:13:14,269
it's certainly a huge part of what it
 

615
00:13:14,269 --> 00:13:17,079
it's certainly a huge part of what it
means to be a human if I were to say you

616
00:13:17,079 --> 00:13:17,089
means to be a human if I were to say you
 

617
00:13:17,089 --> 00:13:19,030
means to be a human if I were to say you
know what I don't believe in forces I

618
00:13:19,030 --> 00:13:19,040
know what I don't believe in forces I
 

619
00:13:19,040 --> 00:13:20,890
know what I don't believe in forces I
think that when I push on

620
00:13:20,890 --> 00:13:20,900
think that when I push on
 

621
00:13:20,900 --> 00:13:23,350
think that when I push on
a massive object a ghost leaves my body

622
00:13:23,350 --> 00:13:23,360
a massive object a ghost leaves my body
 

623
00:13:23,360 --> 00:13:25,540
a massive object a ghost leaves my body
and enters the object I'm pushing and

624
00:13:25,540 --> 00:13:25,550
and enters the object I'm pushing and
 

625
00:13:25,550 --> 00:13:27,460
and enters the object I'm pushing and
these ghosts happen to just get really

626
00:13:27,460 --> 00:13:27,470
these ghosts happen to just get really
 

627
00:13:27,470 --> 00:13:29,380
these ghosts happen to just get really
lazy when they're around massive things

628
00:13:29,380 --> 00:13:29,390
lazy when they're around massive things
 

629
00:13:29,390 --> 00:13:32,920
lazy when they're around massive things
and that's why F equals MA oh and by the

630
00:13:32,920 --> 00:13:32,930
and that's why F equals MA oh and by the
 

631
00:13:32,930 --> 00:13:34,480
and that's why F equals MA oh and by the
way the laziness of the ghost is in

632
00:13:34,480 --> 00:13:34,490
way the laziness of the ghost is in
 

633
00:13:34,490 --> 00:13:36,460
way the laziness of the ghost is in
proportion to the mass of the object so

634
00:13:36,460 --> 00:13:36,470
proportion to the mass of the object so
 

635
00:13:36,470 --> 00:13:38,290
proportion to the mass of the object so
boom prove me wrong every experiment

636
00:13:38,290 --> 00:13:38,300
boom prove me wrong every experiment
 

637
00:13:38,300 --> 00:13:41,760
boom prove me wrong every experiment
well you can never find the ghost and so

638
00:13:41,760 --> 00:13:41,770
well you can never find the ghost and so
 

639
00:13:41,770 --> 00:13:46,000
well you can never find the ghost and so
none of that theory is scientific but

640
00:13:46,000 --> 00:13:46,010
none of that theory is scientific but
 

641
00:13:46,010 --> 00:13:48,570
none of that theory is scientific but
once I start saying can I see the ghost

642
00:13:48,570 --> 00:13:48,580
once I start saying can I see the ghost
 

643
00:13:48,580 --> 00:13:51,280
once I start saying can I see the ghost
Why should there be a ghost and if there

644
00:13:51,280 --> 00:13:51,290
Why should there be a ghost and if there
 

645
00:13:51,290 --> 00:13:53,230
Why should there be a ghost and if there
aren't ghosts what might I expect and I

646
00:13:53,230 --> 00:13:53,240
aren't ghosts what might I expect and I
 

647
00:13:53,240 --> 00:13:56,560
aren't ghosts what might I expect and I
start to do different tests to see is

fundamentally the question of well what
is a force isn't incredibly important we

726
00:15:38,700 --> 00:15:38,710
is a force isn't incredibly important we
 

727
00:15:38,710 --> 00:15:40,230
is a force isn't incredibly important we
need to have that conversation but it

00:15:40,230 --> 00:15:40,240
need to have that conversation but it
 

729
00:15:40,240 --> 00:15:42,270
need to have that conversation but it
needs to be done in this very political

730
00:15:42,270 --> 00:15:42,280
needs to be done in this very political
 

731
00:15:42,280 --> 00:15:44,160
needs to be done in this very political
way of like let's be respectful of

732
00:15:44,160 --> 00:15:44,170
way of like let's be respectful of
 

733
00:15:44,170 --> 00:15:45,600
way of like let's be respectful of
everyone and let's realize that we're

734
00:15:45,600 --> 00:15:45,610
everyone and let's realize that we're

all learning together and not shutting
 

737

all learning together and not shutting
out other people and so when you look at

738
00:15:51,480 --> 00:15:51,490
out other people and so when you look at
 

739
00:15:51,490 --> 00:15:55,560
out other people and so when you look at
a lot of revolutionary ideas they were

740
00:15:55,560 --> 00:15:55,570
a lot of revolutionary ideas they were
 

741
00:15:55,570 --> 00:15:58,620
a lot of revolutionary ideas they were
not accepted right away and you know

742
00:15:58,620 --> 00:15:58,630
not accepted right away and you know
 

743
00:15:58,630 --> 00:16:00,510
not accepted right away and you know

of agree with Galileo but I'm gonna have
 

751
00:16:07,630 --> 00:16:12,510

to not say that I'll have to create and

00:17:16,000 --> 00:17:16,010
their ideas and how they responded to

typical criticisms of well the earth

804

typical criticisms of well the earth
 

805
00:17:18,350 --> 00:17:21,180
typical criticisms of well the earth
isn't flat because what about this and I

806
00:17:21,180 --> 00:17:21,190
isn't flat because what about this and I
 

807
00:17:21,190 --> 00:17:23,319
isn't flat because what about this and I
could not tell and I mentioned this in

808
00:17:23,319 --> 00:17:23,329
could not tell and I mentioned this in
 

809
00:17:23,329 --> 00:17:25,449
could not tell and I mentioned this in
my video I couldn't tell how many of

810
00:17:25,449 --> 00:17:25,459
my video I couldn't tell how many of
 

811
00:17:25,459 --> 00:17:28,660
my video I couldn't tell how many of
these community members actually

812
00:17:28,660 --> 00:17:28,670
these community members actually
 

813
00:17:28,670 --> 00:17:30,700
these community members actually
believed the earth was flat or were just

814
00:17:30,700 --> 00:17:30,710
believed the earth was flat or were just
 

815
00:17:30,710 --> 00:17:34,090
believed the earth was flat or were just
trolling and I realized that the

816
00:17:34,090 --> 00:17:34,100
trolling and I realized that the
 

817
00:17:34,100 --> 00:17:37,180
trolling and I realized that the
fascinating thing is how do we know

818
00:17:37,180 --> 00:17:37,190
fascinating thing is how do we know
 

819
00:17:37,190 --> 00:17:39,570
fascinating thing is how do we know
anything and what makes for a good

820
00:17:39,570 --> 00:17:39,580
anything and what makes for a good
 

821
00:17:39,580 --> 00:17:43,990
anything and what makes for a good
belief versus a maybe not so tenable or

822
00:17:43,990 --> 00:17:44,000
belief versus a maybe not so tenable or
 

823
00:17:44,000 --> 00:17:47,170
belief versus a maybe not so tenable or
good belief and so that's really what my

824
00:17:47,170 --> 00:17:47,180
good belief and so that's really what my
 

825
00:17:47,180 --> 00:17:49,270
good belief and so that's really what my
video about earth being flat is about

826
00:17:49,270 --> 00:17:49,280
video about earth being flat is about
 

827
00:17:49,280 --> 00:17:51,400
video about earth being flat is about
it's about look there are a lot of

828
00:17:51,400 --> 00:17:51,410
it's about look there are a lot of
 

829
00:17:51,410 --> 00:17:55,320
it's about look there are a lot of
reasons the earth is probably not flat

830
00:17:55,320 --> 00:17:55,330
reasons the earth is probably not flat
 

831
00:17:55,330 --> 00:18:00,730
reasons the earth is probably not flat
but a Flat Earth believer can respond to

832
00:18:00,730 --> 00:18:00,740
but a Flat Earth believer can respond to
 

833
00:18:00,740 --> 00:18:02,890
but a Flat Earth believer can respond to
every single one of them but it's all in

834
00:18:02,890 --> 00:18:02,900
every single one of them but it's all in
 

835
00:18:02,900 --> 00:18:05,230
every single one of them but it's all in
an ad hoc way and all of these all their

836
00:18:05,230 --> 00:18:05,240
an ad hoc way and all of these all their
 

837
00:18:05,240 --> 00:18:06,940
an ad hoc way and all of these all their
rebuttals aren't necessarily gonna form

838
00:18:06,940 --> 00:18:06,950
rebuttals aren't necessarily gonna form
 

839
00:18:06,950 --> 00:18:11,290
rebuttals aren't necessarily gonna form
a cohesive noncontradictory whole and I

840
00:18:11,290 --> 00:18:11,300
a cohesive noncontradictory whole and I
 

841
00:18:11,300 --> 00:18:12,970
a cohesive noncontradictory whole and I
believe that's the episode where I talk

842
00:18:12,970 --> 00:18:12,980
believe that's the episode where I talk
 

843
00:18:12,980 --> 00:18:15,970
believe that's the episode where I talk
about Occam's razor and Newton's flaming

844
00:18:15,970 --> 00:18:15,980
about Occam's razor and Newton's flaming
 

845
00:18:15,980 --> 00:18:18,640
about Occam's razor and Newton's flaming
laser sword and then I say well you know

846
00:18:18,640 --> 00:18:18,650
laser sword and then I say well you know
 

847
00:18:18,650 --> 00:18:22,720
laser sword and then I say well you know
what wait a second we know that space

848
00:18:22,720 --> 00:18:22,730
what wait a second we know that space
 

849
00:18:22,730 --> 00:18:25,510
what wait a second we know that space
contracts as you move and so to a

850
00:18:25,510 --> 00:18:25,520
contracts as you move and so to a
 

851
00:18:25,520 --> 00:18:26,920
contracts as you move and so to a
particle moving near the speed of light

852
00:18:26,920 --> 00:18:26,930
particle moving near the speed of light
 

853
00:18:26,930 --> 00:18:29,320
particle moving near the speed of light
towards Earth earth would be flattened

854
00:18:29,320 --> 00:18:29,330
towards Earth earth would be flattened
 

855
00:18:29,330 --> 00:18:31,270
towards Earth earth would be flattened
in the direction of that particles

856
00:18:31,270 --> 00:18:31,280
in the direction of that particles
 

857
00:18:31,280 --> 00:18:36,340
in the direction of that particles
travel so to them earth is flat like we

858
00:18:36,340 --> 00:18:36,350
travel so to them earth is flat like we
 

859
00:18:36,350 --> 00:18:38,950
travel so to them earth is flat like we
need to be you know really generous to

860
00:18:38,950 --> 00:18:38,960
need to be you know really generous to
 

861
00:18:38,960 --> 00:18:42,300
need to be you know really generous to
even wild ideas because they're all

862
00:18:42,300 --> 00:18:42,310
even wild ideas because they're all
 

863
00:18:42,310 --> 00:18:45,220
even wild ideas because they're all
thinking they're all the communication

864
00:18:45,220 --> 00:18:45,230
thinking they're all the communication
 

865
00:18:45,230 --> 00:18:47,110
thinking they're all the communication
of ideas and what else can it mean to be

866
00:18:47,110 --> 00:18:47,120
of ideas and what else can it mean to be
 

867
00:18:47,120 --> 00:18:50,290
of ideas and what else can it mean to be
a human yeah and I think I'm a huge fan

868
00:18:50,290 --> 00:18:50,300
a human yeah and I think I'm a huge fan
 

869
00:18:50,300 --> 00:18:54,700
a human yeah and I think I'm a huge fan
of the Flat Earth theory quote-unquote

870
00:18:54,700 --> 00:18:54,710
of the Flat Earth theory quote-unquote
 

871
00:18:54,710 --> 00:18:57,010
of the Flat Earth theory quote-unquote
in the sense that to me feels harmless

872
00:18:57,010 --> 00:18:57,020
in the sense that to me feels harmless
 

873
00:18:57,020 --> 00:18:59,140
in the sense that to me feels harmless
to explore some of the questions of what

874
00:18:59,140 --> 00:18:59,150
to explore some of the questions of what
 

875
00:18:59,150 --> 00:19:00,700
to explore some of the questions of what
it means to believe something what it

876
00:19:00,700 --> 00:19:00,710
it means to believe something what it
 

877
00:19:00,710 --> 00:19:04,210
it means to believe something what it
means to explore the edge of science and

878
00:19:04,210 --> 00:19:04,220
means to explore the edge of science and
 

879
00:19:04,220 --> 00:19:06,340
means to explore the edge of science and
so on it's because it's a harm it's to

880
00:19:06,340 --> 00:19:06,350
so on it's because it's a harm it's to
 

881
00:19:06,350 --> 00:19:08,680
so on it's because it's a harm it's to
me nobody gets hurt whether the earth is

882
00:19:08,680 --> 00:19:08,690
me nobody gets hurt whether the earth is
 

883
00:19:08,690 --> 00:19:10,870
me nobody gets hurt whether the earth is
flat or round not literally but I mean

884
00:19:10,870 --> 00:19:10,880
flat or round not literally but I mean
 

885
00:19:10,880 --> 00:19:12,580
flat or round not literally but I mean
intellectually when we're just having a

886
00:19:12,580 --> 00:19:12,590
intellectually when we're just having a
 

887
00:19:12,590 --> 00:19:15,250
intellectually when we're just having a
conversation that said again to elitism

888
00:19:15,250 --> 00:19:15,260
conversation that said again to elitism
 

889
00:19:15,260 --> 00:19:18,310
conversation that said again to elitism
I find that scientists roll their eyes

890
00:19:18,310 --> 00:19:18,320
I find that scientists roll their eyes
 

891
00:19:18,320 --> 00:19:22,150
I find that scientists roll their eyes
way too fast on the Flat Earth the kind

892
00:19:22,150 --> 00:19:22,160
way too fast on the Flat Earth the kind
 

893
00:19:22,160 --> 00:19:24,549
way too fast on the Flat Earth the kind
of dismissal that I see to this you

894
00:19:24,549 --> 00:19:24,559
of dismissal that I see to this you
 

895
00:19:24,559 --> 00:19:27,310
of dismissal that I see to this you
of an ocean they haven't like sat down

896
00:19:27,310 --> 00:19:27,320
of an ocean they haven't like sat down
 

897
00:19:27,320 --> 00:19:29,019
of an ocean they haven't like sat down
and say what are the arguments they're

898
00:19:29,019 --> 00:19:29,029
and say what are the arguments they're
 

899
00:19:29,029 --> 00:19:31,090
and say what are the arguments they're
being proposed and this is why these

900
00:19:31,090 --> 00:19:31,100
being proposed and this is why these
 

901
00:19:31,100 --> 00:19:33,340
being proposed and this is why these
arguments incorrect so this is you know

902
00:19:33,340 --> 00:19:33,350
arguments incorrect so this is you know
 

903
00:19:33,350 --> 00:19:35,919
arguments incorrect so this is you know
that should be something that scientists

904
00:19:35,919 --> 00:19:35,929
that should be something that scientists
 

905
00:19:35,929 --> 00:19:39,700
that should be something that scientists
should always do even to the most sort

906
00:19:39,700 --> 00:19:39,710
should always do even to the most sort
 

907
00:19:39,710 --> 00:19:42,639
should always do even to the most sort
of ideas that seem ridiculous so I like

908
00:19:42,639 --> 00:19:42,649
of ideas that seem ridiculous so I like
 

909
00:19:42,649 --> 00:19:46,029
of ideas that seem ridiculous so I like
this is almost it's almost my test when

910
00:19:46,029 --> 00:19:46,039
this is almost it's almost my test when
 

911
00:19:46,039 --> 00:19:47,919
this is almost it's almost my test when
I ask people what they think about Flat

912
00:19:47,919 --> 00:19:47,929
I ask people what they think about Flat
 

913
00:19:47,929 --> 00:19:49,570
I ask people what they think about Flat
Earth theory to see how quickly they

914
00:19:49,570 --> 00:19:49,580
Earth theory to see how quickly they
 

915
00:19:49,580 --> 00:19:50,860
Earth theory to see how quickly they
roll their eyes

916
00:19:50,860 --> 00:19:50,870
roll their eyes
 

917
00:19:50,870 --> 00:19:52,360
roll their eyes
well yeah I mean let me go on record

918
00:19:52,360 --> 00:19:52,370
well yeah I mean let me go on record
 

919
00:19:52,370 --> 00:19:57,669
well yeah I mean let me go on record
yeah and say that the earth is not flat

920
00:19:57,669 --> 00:19:57,679
yeah and say that the earth is not flat
 

921
00:19:57,679 --> 00:20:01,379
yeah and say that the earth is not flat
it is a three-dimensional spheroid

922
00:20:01,379 --> 00:20:01,389
it is a three-dimensional spheroid
 

923
00:20:01,389 --> 00:20:06,070
it is a three-dimensional spheroid
however I don't know that and it has not

924
00:20:06,070 --> 00:20:06,080
however I don't know that and it has not
 

925
00:20:06,080 --> 00:20:08,139
however I don't know that and it has not
been proven signs doesn't prove anything

926
00:20:08,139 --> 00:20:08,149
been proven signs doesn't prove anything
 

927
00:20:08,149 --> 00:20:11,019
been proven signs doesn't prove anything
it just reduces uncertainty could the

928
00:20:11,019 --> 00:20:11,029
it just reduces uncertainty could the
 

929
00:20:11,029 --> 00:20:15,460
it just reduces uncertainty could the
earth actually be flat extremely

930
00:20:15,460 --> 00:20:15,470
earth actually be flat extremely
 

931
00:20:15,470 --> 00:20:19,509
earth actually be flat extremely
unlikely yes extremely unlikely and so

932
00:20:19,509 --> 00:20:19,519
unlikely yes extremely unlikely and so
 

933
00:20:19,519 --> 00:20:22,299
unlikely yes extremely unlikely and so
it is a ridiculous notion if we care

934
00:20:22,299 --> 00:20:22,309
it is a ridiculous notion if we care
 

935
00:20:22,309 --> 00:20:25,419
it is a ridiculous notion if we care
about how probable and certain our ideas

936
00:20:25,419 --> 00:20:25,429
about how probable and certain our ideas
 

937
00:20:25,429 --> 00:20:27,759
about how probable and certain our ideas
might be but I think it's incredibly

938
00:20:27,759 --> 00:20:27,769
might be but I think it's incredibly
 

939
00:20:27,769 --> 00:20:31,149
might be but I think it's incredibly
important to talk about science in that

940
00:20:31,149 --> 00:20:31,159
important to talk about science in that
 

941
00:20:31,159 --> 00:20:35,609
important to talk about science in that
way and to not resort to well it's true

942
00:20:35,609 --> 00:20:35,619
way and to not resort to well it's true
 

943
00:20:35,619 --> 00:20:38,680
way and to not resort to well it's true
it's true in the same way that a

944
00:20:38,680 --> 00:20:38,690
it's true in the same way that a
 

945
00:20:38,690 --> 00:20:42,669
it's true in the same way that a
mathematical theorem is true and I think

946
00:20:42,669 --> 00:20:42,679
mathematical theorem is true and I think
 

947
00:20:42,679 --> 00:20:46,450
mathematical theorem is true and I think
we're kind of like being pretty pedantic

948
00:20:46,450 --> 00:20:46,460
we're kind of like being pretty pedantic
 

949
00:20:46,460 --> 00:20:50,200
we're kind of like being pretty pedantic
about defining this stuff but like sure

950
00:20:50,200 --> 00:20:50,210
about defining this stuff but like sure
 

951
00:20:50,210 --> 00:20:51,820
about defining this stuff but like sure
I could take a rocket ship out and I

952
00:20:51,820 --> 00:20:51,830
I could take a rocket ship out and I
 

953
00:20:51,830 --> 00:20:53,769
I could take a rocket ship out and I
could sorbets earth and look at it and

954
00:20:53,769 --> 00:20:53,779
could sorbets earth and look at it and
 

955
00:20:53,779 --> 00:20:57,039
could sorbets earth and look at it and
it would look like a ball right but I

956
00:20:57,039 --> 00:20:57,049
it would look like a ball right but I
 

957
00:20:57,049 --> 00:20:58,659
it would look like a ball right but I
still can't prove that I'm not living in

958
00:20:58,659 --> 00:20:58,669
still can't prove that I'm not living in
 

959
00:20:58,669 --> 00:20:59,680
still can't prove that I'm not living in
a simulation that i'm not a

960
00:20:59,680 --> 00:20:59,690
a simulation that i'm not a
 

961
00:20:59,690 --> 00:21:01,720
a simulation that i'm not a
brain-in-a-vat that this isn't all an

962
00:21:01,720 --> 00:21:01,730
brain-in-a-vat that this isn't all an
 

963
00:21:01,730 --> 00:21:03,399
brain-in-a-vat that this isn't all an
elaborate ruse created by some

964
00:21:03,399 --> 00:21:03,409
elaborate ruse created by some
 

965
00:21:03,409 --> 00:21:04,539
elaborate ruse created by some
technologically advanced

966
00:21:04,539 --> 00:21:04,549
technologically advanced
 

967
00:21:04,549 --> 00:21:06,759
technologically advanced
extraterrestrial civilization right so

968
00:21:06,759 --> 00:21:06,769
extraterrestrial civilization right so
 

969
00:21:06,769 --> 00:21:10,210
extraterrestrial civilization right so
there's always some doubt and that's

970
00:21:10,210 --> 00:21:10,220
there's always some doubt and that's
 

971
00:21:10,220 --> 00:21:12,850
there's always some doubt and that's
fine that's exciting and I think that

972
00:21:12,850 --> 00:21:12,860
fine that's exciting and I think that
 

973
00:21:12,860 --> 00:21:14,950
fine that's exciting and I think that
kind of doubt practically speaking is

974
00:21:14,950 --> 00:21:14,960
kind of doubt practically speaking is
 

975
00:21:14,960 --> 00:21:16,690
kind of doubt practically speaking is
useful when you start talking about

976
00:21:16,690 --> 00:21:16,700
useful when you start talking about
 

977
00:21:16,700 --> 00:21:19,119
useful when you start talking about
quantum mechanics or string theory sort

978
00:21:19,119 --> 00:21:19,129
quantum mechanics or string theory sort
 

979
00:21:19,129 --> 00:21:21,609
quantum mechanics or string theory sort
of it helps to me that kind of little

980
00:21:21,609 --> 00:21:21,619
of it helps to me that kind of little
 

981
00:21:21,619 --> 00:21:24,789
of it helps to me that kind of little
adds a little spice into the thinking

982
00:21:24,789 --> 00:21:24,799
adds a little spice into the thinking
 

983
00:21:24,799 --> 00:21:28,299
adds a little spice into the thinking
process of scientists so I mean just I

984
00:21:28,299 --> 00:21:28,309
process of scientists so I mean just I
 

985
00:21:28,309 --> 00:21:30,549
process of scientists so I mean just I
just as a thought experiment your video

986
00:21:30,549 --> 00:21:30,559
just as a thought experiment your video
 

987
00:21:30,559 --> 00:21:32,769
just as a thought experiment your video
kind of okay say the earth is flat

988
00:21:32,769 --> 00:21:32,779
kind of okay say the earth is flat
 

989
00:21:32,779 --> 00:21:35,529
kind of okay say the earth is flat
what would the forces when you walk

990
00:21:35,529 --> 00:21:35,539
what would the forces when you walk
 

991
00:21:35,539 --> 00:21:37,840
what would the forces when you walk
about this flat or earth feel like

992
00:21:37,840 --> 00:21:37,850
about this flat or earth feel like
 

993
00:21:37,850 --> 00:21:39,250
about this flat or earth feel like
- the human that's a really nice thought

994
00:21:39,250 --> 00:21:39,260
- the human that's a really nice thought
 

995
00:21:39,260 --> 00:21:40,930
- the human that's a really nice thought
experiment to think about right cuz

996
00:21:40,930 --> 00:21:40,940
experiment to think about right cuz
 

997
00:21:40,940 --> 00:21:43,120
experiment to think about right cuz
what's really nice about it is that it's

998
00:21:43,120 --> 00:21:43,130
what's really nice about it is that it's
 

999
00:21:43,130 --> 00:21:45,700
what's really nice about it is that it's
it's a funny thought experiment but you

1000
00:21:45,700 --> 00:21:45,710
it's a funny thought experiment but you
 

1001
00:21:45,710 --> 00:21:48,100
it's a funny thought experiment but you
actually wind up accidentally learning a

1002
00:21:48,100 --> 00:21:48,110
actually wind up accidentally learning a
 

1003
00:21:48,110 --> 00:21:50,409
actually wind up accidentally learning a
whole lot about gravity and about

1004
00:21:50,409 --> 00:21:50,419
whole lot about gravity and about
 

1005
00:21:50,419 --> 00:21:54,520
whole lot about gravity and about
relativity and geometry and I think

1006
00:21:54,520 --> 00:21:54,530
relativity and geometry and I think
 

1007
00:21:54,530 --> 00:21:56,260
relativity and geometry and I think
that's really the goal of what I'm doing

1008
00:21:56,260 --> 00:21:56,270
that's really the goal of what I'm doing
 

1009
00:21:56,270 --> 00:21:57,549
that's really the goal of what I'm doing
I'm not trying to like convince people

1010
00:21:57,549 --> 00:21:57,559
I'm not trying to like convince people
 

1011
00:21:57,559 --> 00:21:59,740
I'm not trying to like convince people
that the earth is round I feel like you

1012
00:21:59,740 --> 00:21:59,750
that the earth is round I feel like you
 

1013
00:21:59,750 --> 00:22:01,090
that the earth is round I feel like you
either believe that it is or you don't

1014
00:22:01,090 --> 00:22:01,100
either believe that it is or you don't
 

1015
00:22:01,100 --> 00:22:03,730
either believe that it is or you don't
and like that's you know how can I

1016
00:22:03,730 --> 00:22:03,740
and like that's you know how can I
 

1017
00:22:03,740 --> 00:22:05,500
and like that's you know how can I
change that yeah what I can do is change

1018
00:22:05,500 --> 00:22:05,510
change that yeah what I can do is change
 

1019
00:22:05,510 --> 00:22:09,340
change that yeah what I can do is change
how you think and how you are introduced

1020
00:22:09,340 --> 00:22:09,350
how you think and how you are introduced
 

1021
00:22:09,350 --> 00:22:12,310
how you think and how you are introduced
to important concepts like well how does

1022
00:22:12,310 --> 00:22:12,320
to important concepts like well how does
 

1023
00:22:12,320 --> 00:22:15,010
to important concepts like well how does
gravity operate oh it's all about the

1024
00:22:15,010 --> 00:22:15,020
gravity operate oh it's all about the
 

1025
00:22:15,020 --> 00:22:16,960
gravity operate oh it's all about the
center of mass of an object so right on

1026
00:22:16,960 --> 00:22:16,970
center of mass of an object so right on
 

1027
00:22:16,970 --> 00:22:18,669
center of mass of an object so right on
a sphere we're all pulled towards the

1028
00:22:18,669 --> 00:22:18,679
a sphere we're all pulled towards the
 

1029
00:22:18,679 --> 00:22:20,399
a sphere we're all pulled towards the
middle essentially the centroid

1030
00:22:20,399 --> 00:22:20,409
middle essentially the centroid
 

1031
00:22:20,409 --> 00:22:23,200
middle essentially the centroid
geometrically but on a disk ooh you're

1032
00:22:23,200 --> 00:22:23,210
geometrically but on a disk ooh you're
 

1033
00:22:23,210 --> 00:22:24,610
geometrically but on a disk ooh you're
gonna be pulled at a weird angle if

1034
00:22:24,610 --> 00:22:24,620
gonna be pulled at a weird angle if
 

1035
00:22:24,620 --> 00:22:27,250
gonna be pulled at a weird angle if
you're out near the edge and that

1036
00:22:27,250 --> 00:22:27,260
you're out near the edge and that
 

1037
00:22:27,260 --> 00:22:29,620
you're out near the edge and that
stuff's fascinating yeah and to me

1038
00:22:29,620 --> 00:22:29,630
stuff's fascinating yeah and to me
 

1039
00:22:29,630 --> 00:22:31,870
stuff's fascinating yeah and to me
that's that that was that that

1040
00:22:31,870 --> 00:22:31,880
that's that that was that that
 

1041
00:22:31,880 --> 00:22:35,680
that's that that was that that
particular video opened my eyes even

1042
00:22:35,680 --> 00:22:35,690
particular video opened my eyes even
 

1043
00:22:35,690 --> 00:22:37,899
particular video opened my eyes even
more to what gravity is it's just a

1044
00:22:37,899 --> 00:22:37,909
more to what gravity is it's just a
 

1045
00:22:37,909 --> 00:22:39,430
more to what gravity is it's just a
really nice visualization to love

1046
00:22:39,430 --> 00:22:39,440
really nice visualization to love
 

1047
00:22:39,440 --> 00:22:42,130
really nice visualization to love
because you always imagine gravity was

1048
00:22:42,130 --> 00:22:42,140
because you always imagine gravity was
 

1049
00:22:42,140 --> 00:22:44,470
because you always imagine gravity was
spheres with masses that are spheres

1050
00:22:44,470 --> 00:22:44,480
spheres with masses that are spheres
 

1051
00:22:44,480 --> 00:22:47,020
spheres with masses that are spheres
yeah and imagining gravity on masses

1052
00:22:47,020 --> 00:22:47,030
yeah and imagining gravity on masses
 

1053
00:22:47,030 --> 00:22:48,880
yeah and imagining gravity on masses
that are not spherical some some other

1054
00:22:48,880 --> 00:22:48,890
that are not spherical some some other
 

1055
00:22:48,890 --> 00:22:53,049
that are not spherical some some other
shape but in here a plate a flat object

1056
00:22:53,049 --> 00:22:53,059
shape but in here a plate a flat object
 

1057
00:22:53,059 --> 00:22:54,610
shape but in here a plate a flat object
is really interesting it makes you

1058
00:22:54,610 --> 00:22:54,620
is really interesting it makes you
 

1059
00:22:54,620 --> 00:22:56,560
is really interesting it makes you
really kind of visualizing it they're

1060
00:22:56,560 --> 00:22:56,570
really kind of visualizing it they're
 

1061
00:22:56,570 --> 00:23:00,940
really kind of visualizing it they're
much a way the force yeah even if a disc

1062
00:23:00,940 --> 00:23:00,950
much a way the force yeah even if a disc
 

1063
00:23:00,950 --> 00:23:05,230
much a way the force yeah even if a disc
the size of Earth would be impossible

1064
00:23:05,230 --> 00:23:05,240
the size of Earth would be impossible
 

1065
00:23:05,240 --> 00:23:07,690
the size of Earth would be impossible
I think anything larger than like the

1066
00:23:07,690 --> 00:23:07,700
I think anything larger than like the
 

1067
00:23:07,700 --> 00:23:09,840
I think anything larger than like the
moon basically needs to be a sphere

1068
00:23:09,840 --> 00:23:09,850
moon basically needs to be a sphere
 

1069
00:23:09,850 --> 00:23:15,430
moon basically needs to be a sphere
because gravity will round it out so you

1070
00:23:15,430 --> 00:23:15,440
because gravity will round it out so you
 

1071
00:23:15,440 --> 00:23:16,990
because gravity will round it out so you
can't have a teacup the size of Jupiter

1072
00:23:16,990 --> 00:23:17,000
can't have a teacup the size of Jupiter
 

1073
00:23:17,000 --> 00:23:19,210
can't have a teacup the size of Jupiter
right there's a great book about a

1074
00:23:19,210 --> 00:23:19,220
right there's a great book about a
 

1075
00:23:19,220 --> 00:23:22,159
right there's a great book about a
teacup in the universe that

1076
00:23:22,159 --> 00:23:22,169
teacup in the universe that
 

1077
00:23:22,169 --> 00:23:23,509
teacup in the universe that
highly recommend I don't remember the

1078
00:23:23,509 --> 00:23:23,519
highly recommend I don't remember the
 

1079
00:23:23,519 --> 00:23:25,940
highly recommend I don't remember the
author I forget her name but it's a

1080
00:23:25,940 --> 00:23:25,950
author I forget her name but it's a
 

1081
00:23:25,950 --> 00:23:27,799

I think it's called teacup in the

1084
00:23:29,029 --> 00:23:29,039
I think it's called teacup in the
 

1085
00:23:29,039 --> 00:23:31,159
I think it's called teacup in the

00:23:45,470 --> 00:23:45,480
right is incredible and as do I but this
 

1097
00:23:45,480 --> 00:23:48,739
right is incredible and as do I but this
particular Flat Earth video has more

who believes in Flat Earth but sort of
 

1107
00:24:02,039 --> 00:24:03,919
who believes in Flat Earth but sort of
the anti scientific community that

1108
00:24:03,919 --> 00:24:03,929
the anti scientific community that
 

1109
00:24:03,929 --> 00:24:07,450
the anti scientific community that
naturally distrust scientists in a way

1110
00:24:07,450 --> 00:24:07,460
naturally distrust scientists in a way
 

1111
00:24:07,460 --> 00:24:12,109
naturally distrust scientists in a way
that's that's not an open-minded way

1112
00:24:12,109 --> 00:24:12,119
that's that's not an open-minded way
 

1113
00:24:12,119 --> 00:24:13,700
that's that's not an open-minded way
like really just distrust scientists

1114
00:24:13,700 --> 00:24:13,710
like really just distrust scientists
 

1115
00:24:13,710 --> 00:24:14,989
like really just distrust scientists
like they're bought by some place

1116
00:24:14,989 --> 00:24:14,999
like they're bought by some place
 

1117
00:24:14,999 --> 00:24:17,840
like they're bought by some place
they're kind of mechanism of the some

1118
00:24:17,840 --> 00:24:17,850
they're kind of mechanism of the some
 

1119
00:24:17,850 --> 00:24:19,279
they're kind of mechanism of the some
kind of bigger system that's trying to

1120
00:24:19,279 --> 00:24:19,289
kind of bigger system that's trying to
 

1121
00:24:19,289 --> 00:24:21,830
kind of bigger system that's trying to
manipulate him ins what's your sense of

1122
00:24:21,830 --> 00:24:21,840
manipulate him ins what's your sense of
 

1123
00:24:21,840 --> 00:24:24,680
manipulate him ins what's your sense of
the size of that community you're one of

1124
00:24:24,680 --> 00:24:24,690
the size of that community you're one of
 

1125
00:24:24,690 --> 00:24:28,340
the size of that community you're one of
the sort of great educators in the world

1126
00:24:28,340 --> 00:24:28,350
the sort of great educators in the world
 

1127
00:24:28,350 --> 00:24:32,090
the sort of great educators in the world
that educates people on the exciting

1128
00:24:32,090 --> 00:24:32,100
that educates people on the exciting
 

1129
00:24:32,100 --> 00:24:36,680
that educates people on the exciting
power of science so you're kind of up

1130
00:24:36,680 --> 00:24:36,690
power of science so you're kind of up
 

1131
00:24:36,690 --> 00:24:38,599
power of science so you're kind of up
against this community what's your sense

1132
00:24:38,599 --> 00:24:38,609
against this community what's your sense
 

1133
00:24:38,609 --> 00:24:42,529
against this community what's your sense
of it i I really have no idea I haven't

1134
00:24:42,529 --> 00:24:42,539
of it i I really have no idea I haven't
 

1135
00:24:42,539 --> 00:24:44,389
of it i I really have no idea I haven't
looked at the likes and dislikes on the

1136
00:24:44,389 --> 00:24:44,399
looked at the likes and dislikes on the
 

1137
00:24:44,399 --> 00:24:46,269
looked at the likes and dislikes on the
Flat Earth video and so I would wonder

1138
00:24:46,269 --> 00:24:46,279
Flat Earth video and so I would wonder
 

1139
00:24:46,279 --> 00:24:49,159
Flat Earth video and so I would wonder
if it has a greater percentage of

1140
00:24:49,159 --> 00:24:49,169
if it has a greater percentage of
 

1141
00:24:49,169 --> 00:24:52,099
if it has a greater percentage of
dislikes than usual is that because of

1142
00:24:52,099 --> 00:24:52,109
dislikes than usual is that because of
 

1143
00:24:52,109 --> 00:24:55,369
dislikes than usual is that because of
people disliking it because they you

1144
00:24:55,369 --> 00:24:55,379
people disliking it because they you
 

1145
00:24:55,379 --> 00:24:59,149
people disliking it because they you
know think that it's a video about earth

1146
00:24:59,149 --> 00:24:59,159
know think that it's a video about earth
 

1147
00:24:59,159 --> 00:25:01,190
know think that it's a video about earth
being flat and they find that ridiculous

1148
00:25:01,190 --> 00:25:01,200
being flat and they find that ridiculous
 

1149
00:25:01,200 --> 00:25:02,299
being flat and they find that ridiculous
and they just like it without even

1150
00:25:02,299 --> 00:25:02,309
and they just like it without even
 

1151
00:25:02,309 --> 00:25:04,820
and they just like it without even
really watching much do they wish that I

1152
00:25:04,820 --> 00:25:04,830
really watching much do they wish that I
 

1153
00:25:04,830 --> 00:25:07,700
really watching much do they wish that I
was more like dismissive of this latter

1154
00:25:07,700 --> 00:25:07,710
was more like dismissive of this latter
 

1155
00:25:07,710 --> 00:25:10,340
was more like dismissive of this latter
theories yeah that's awesome I know

1156
00:25:10,340 --> 00:25:10,350
theories yeah that's awesome I know
 

1157
00:25:10,350 --> 00:25:12,229
theories yeah that's awesome I know
there are a lot of response videos that

1158
00:25:12,229 --> 00:25:12,239
there are a lot of response videos that
 

1159
00:25:12,239 --> 00:25:16,519
there are a lot of response videos that
kind of go through the episode and are

1160
00:25:16,519 --> 00:25:16,529
kind of go through the episode and are
 

1161
00:25:16,529 --> 00:25:19,580
kind of go through the episode and are
pro Flat Earth mm-hmm but I don't know

1162
00:25:19,580 --> 00:25:19,590
pro Flat Earth mm-hmm but I don't know
 

1163
00:25:19,590 --> 00:25:22,690
pro Flat Earth mm-hmm but I don't know
if there's a larger community of

1164
00:25:22,690 --> 00:25:22,700
if there's a larger community of
 

1165
00:25:22,700 --> 00:25:25,399
if there's a larger community of
unorthodox thinkers today than there

1166
00:25:25,399 --> 00:25:25,409
unorthodox thinkers today than there
 

1167
00:25:25,409 --> 00:25:28,909
unorthodox thinkers today than there
have been in the past okay and I just

1168
00:25:28,909 --> 00:25:28,919
have been in the past okay and I just
 

1169
00:25:28,919 --> 00:25:30,440
have been in the past okay and I just
want to not lose them I want them to

1170
00:25:30,440 --> 00:25:30,450
want to not lose them I want them to
 

1171
00:25:30,450 --> 00:25:33,080
want to not lose them I want them to
keep listening and thinking and by

1172
00:25:33,080 --> 00:25:33,090
keep listening and thinking and by
 

1173
00:25:33,090 --> 00:25:34,970
keep listening and thinking and by
calling them all you know

1174
00:25:34,970 --> 00:25:34,980
calling them all you know
 

1175
00:25:34,980 --> 00:25:35,600
calling them all you know
idiots

1176
00:25:35,600 --> 00:25:35,610
idiots
 

1177
00:25:35,610 --> 00:25:37,340
idiots
or something like that is no good

1178
00:25:37,340 --> 00:25:37,350
or something like that is no good
 

1179
00:25:37,350 --> 00:25:40,669
or something like that is no good
because how idiotic are they really I

1180
00:25:40,669 --> 00:25:40,679
because how idiotic are they really I
 

1181
00:25:40,679 --> 00:25:44,750
because how idiotic are they really I
mean the earth isn't a sphere at all

1182
00:25:44,750 --> 00:25:44,760
mean the earth isn't a sphere at all
 

1183
00:25:44,760 --> 00:25:46,370
mean the earth isn't a sphere at all
like we know that it's an oblate

1184
00:25:46,370 --> 00:25:46,380
like we know that it's an oblate
 

1185
00:25:46,380 --> 00:25:49,700
like we know that it's an oblate
spheroid and that in and of itself is

1186
00:25:49,700 --> 00:25:49,710
spheroid and that in and of itself is
 

1187
00:25:49,710 --> 00:25:50,990
spheroid and that in and of itself is
really interesting and I investigated

1188
00:25:50,990 --> 00:25:51,000
really interesting and I investigated
 

1189
00:25:51,000 --> 00:25:52,610
really interesting and I investigated
that in which way is down where I'm like

1190
00:25:52,610 --> 00:25:52,620
that in which way is down where I'm like
 

1191
00:25:52,620 --> 00:25:54,590
that in which way is down where I'm like
really down does not point towards the

1192
00:25:54,590 --> 00:25:54,600
really down does not point towards the
 

1193
00:25:54,600 --> 00:25:56,060
really down does not point towards the
center of the earth

1194
00:25:56,060 --> 00:25:56,070
center of the earth
 

1195
00:25:56,070 --> 00:25:58,030
center of the earth
it's it points in a different direction

1196
00:25:58,030 --> 00:25:58,040
it's it points in a different direction
 

1197
00:25:58,040 --> 00:26:00,620
it's it points in a different direction
depending on what's underneath you and

1198
00:26:00,620 --> 00:26:00,630
depending on what's underneath you and
 

1199
00:26:00,630 --> 00:26:02,360
depending on what's underneath you and
what's above you and what's around you

1200
00:26:02,360 --> 00:26:02,370
what's above you and what's around you
 

1201
00:26:02,370 --> 00:26:05,360
what's above you and what's around you
the whole universe is is tugging on me

1202
00:26:05,360 --> 00:26:05,370
the whole universe is is tugging on me
 

1203
00:26:05,370 --> 00:26:08,270
the whole universe is is tugging on me
and then you also show that gravity is

1204
00:26:08,270 --> 00:26:08,280
and then you also show that gravity is
 

1205
00:26:08,280 --> 00:26:11,810
and then you also show that gravity is
non-uniform work across the globe like

1206
00:26:11,810 --> 00:26:11,820
non-uniform work across the globe like
 

1207
00:26:11,820 --> 00:26:14,450
non-uniform work across the globe like
if you just gues thought experiment if

1208
00:26:14,450 --> 00:26:14,460
if you just gues thought experiment if
 

1209
00:26:14,460 --> 00:26:17,930
if you just gues thought experiment if
you build a bridge all the way and all

1210
00:26:17,930 --> 00:26:17,940
you build a bridge all the way and all
 

1211
00:26:17,940 --> 00:26:20,240
you build a bridge all the way and all
the way across the earth and then just

1212
00:26:20,240 --> 00:26:20,250
the way across the earth and then just
 

1213
00:26:20,250 --> 00:26:23,270
the way across the earth and then just
knock out its pillars what would happen

1214
00:26:23,270 --> 00:26:23,280
knock out its pillars what would happen
 

1215
00:26:23,280 --> 00:26:25,730
knock out its pillars what would happen
yeah and you described how it would be

1216
00:26:25,730 --> 00:26:25,740
yeah and you described how it would be
 

1217
00:26:25,740 --> 00:26:28,340
yeah and you described how it would be
like a very chaotic unstable thing

1218
00:26:28,340 --> 00:26:28,350
like a very chaotic unstable thing
 

1219
00:26:28,350 --> 00:26:29,690
like a very chaotic unstable thing
that's happening because gravity is

1220
00:26:29,690 --> 00:26:29,700
that's happening because gravity is
 

1221
00:26:29,700 --> 00:26:31,370
that's happening because gravity is
non-uniform all throughout the earth

1222
00:26:31,370 --> 00:26:31,380
non-uniform all throughout the earth
 

1223
00:26:31,380 --> 00:26:35,840
non-uniform all throughout the earth
yeah in small spaces like the ones we

1224
00:26:35,840 --> 00:26:35,850
yeah in small spaces like the ones we
 

1225
00:26:35,850 --> 00:26:37,760
yeah in small spaces like the ones we
work in we can essentially assume that

1226
00:26:37,760 --> 00:26:37,770
work in we can essentially assume that
 

1227
00:26:37,770 --> 00:26:41,120
work in we can essentially assume that
gravity is uniform but it's not it is

1228
00:26:41,120 --> 00:26:41,130
gravity is uniform but it's not it is
 

1229
00:26:41,130 --> 00:26:42,500
gravity is uniform but it's not it is
weaker the further you are from the

1230
00:26:42,500 --> 00:26:42,510
weaker the further you are from the
 

1231
00:26:42,510 --> 00:26:47,510
weaker the further you are from the
earth and it also is going to be it's

1232
00:26:47,510 --> 00:26:47,520
earth and it also is going to be it's
 

1233
00:26:47,520 --> 00:26:49,310
earth and it also is going to be it's
it's radially pointed towards the middle

1234
00:26:49,310 --> 00:26:49,320
it's radially pointed towards the middle
 

1235
00:26:49,320 --> 00:26:51,650
it's radially pointed towards the middle
of the earth so a really large object

1236
00:26:51,650 --> 00:26:51,660
of the earth so a really large object
 

1237
00:26:51,660 --> 00:26:54,710
of the earth so a really large object
will feel tidal forces because of that

1238
00:26:54,710 --> 00:26:54,720
will feel tidal forces because of that
 

1239
00:26:54,720 --> 00:26:56,090
will feel tidal forces because of that
non-uniform this and we can take

1240
00:26:56,090 --> 00:26:56,100
non-uniform this and we can take
 

1241
00:26:56,100 --> 00:26:58,210
non-uniform this and we can take
advantage of that with satellites right

1242
00:26:58,210 --> 00:26:58,220
advantage of that with satellites right
 

1243
00:26:58,220 --> 00:27:00,440
advantage of that with satellites right
gravitational induced torque it's a

1244
00:27:00,440 --> 00:27:00,450
gravitational induced torque it's a
 

1245
00:27:00,450 --> 00:27:01,669
gravitational induced torque it's a
great way to align your satellite

1246
00:27:01,669 --> 00:27:01,679
great way to align your satellite
 

1247
00:27:01,679 --> 00:27:03,530
great way to align your satellite
without having to use fuel or any kind

1248
00:27:03,530 --> 00:27:03,540
without having to use fuel or any kind
 

1249
00:27:03,540 --> 00:27:06,530
without having to use fuel or any kind
of you know engine so let's jump back to

1250
00:27:06,530 --> 00:27:06,540
of you know engine so let's jump back to
 

1251
00:27:06,540 --> 00:27:08,750
of you know engine so let's jump back to
it artificial intelligence what's your

1252
00:27:08,750 --> 00:27:08,760
it artificial intelligence what's your
 

1253
00:27:08,760 --> 00:27:10,970
it artificial intelligence what's your
thought of the state of where we are at

1254
00:27:10,970 --> 00:27:10,980
thought of the state of where we are at
 

1255
00:27:10,980 --> 00:27:12,289
thought of the state of where we are at
currently with artificial intelligence

1256
00:27:12,289 --> 00:27:12,299
currently with artificial intelligence
 

1257
00:27:12,299 --> 00:27:14,440
currently with artificial intelligence
and what do you think it takes to build

1258
00:27:14,440 --> 00:27:14,450
and what do you think it takes to build
 

1259
00:27:14,450 --> 00:27:16,970
and what do you think it takes to build
human level or superhuman level

1260
00:27:16,970 --> 00:27:16,980
human level or superhuman level
 

1261
00:27:16,980 --> 00:27:18,409
human level or superhuman level
intelligence I don't know what

1262
00:27:18,409 --> 00:27:18,419
intelligence I don't know what
 

1263
00:27:18,419 --> 00:27:21,020
intelligence I don't know what
intelligence means that's my biggest

1264
00:27:21,020 --> 00:27:21,030
intelligence means that's my biggest
 

1265
00:27:21,030 --> 00:27:23,539
intelligence means that's my biggest
question at the moment and it's I think

1266
00:27:23,539 --> 00:27:23,549
question at the moment and it's I think
 

1267
00:27:23,549 --> 00:27:24,980
question at the moment and it's I think
it's cuz my instinct is always to go

1268
00:27:24,980 --> 00:27:24,990
it's cuz my instinct is always to go
 

1269
00:27:24,990 --> 00:27:27,049
it's cuz my instinct is always to go
well what are the foundations here of

1270
00:27:27,049 --> 00:27:27,059
well what are the foundations here of
 

1271
00:27:27,059 --> 00:27:30,289
well what are the foundations here of
our discussion what does it mean to be

1272
00:27:30,289 --> 00:27:30,299
our discussion what does it mean to be
 

1273
00:27:30,299 --> 00:27:31,850
our discussion what does it mean to be
intelligent how do we measure the

1274
00:27:31,850 --> 00:27:31,860
intelligent how do we measure the
 

1275
00:27:31,860 --> 00:27:35,360
intelligent how do we measure the
intelligence of an artificial machine or

1276
00:27:35,360 --> 00:27:35,370
intelligence of an artificial machine or
 

1277
00:27:35,370 --> 00:27:38,270
intelligence of an artificial machine or
a program or something can we say that

1278
00:27:38,270 --> 00:27:38,280
a program or something can we say that
 

1279
00:27:38,280 --> 00:27:40,700
a program or something can we say that
humans are intelligent because there's

1280
00:27:40,700 --> 00:27:40,710
humans are intelligent because there's
 

1281
00:27:40,710 --> 00:27:42,980
humans are intelligent because there's
also a fascinating field of how do you

1282
00:27:42,980 --> 00:27:42,990
also a fascinating field of how do you
 

1283
00:27:42,990 --> 00:27:45,530
also a fascinating field of how do you
measure human intelligence of course but

1284
00:27:45,530 --> 00:27:45,540
measure human intelligence of course but
 

1285
00:27:45,540 --> 00:27:47,299
measure human intelligence of course but
if we just take that for granted saying

1286
00:27:47,299 --> 00:27:47,309
if we just take that for granted saying
 

1287
00:27:47,309 --> 00:27:49,250
if we just take that for granted saying
that the whatever this fuzzy

1288
00:27:49,250 --> 00:27:49,260
that the whatever this fuzzy
 

1289
00:27:49,260 --> 00:27:50,660
that the whatever this fuzzy
intelligence thing we're talking about

1290
00:27:50,660 --> 00:27:50,670
intelligence thing we're talking about
 

1291
00:27:50,670 --> 00:27:54,530
intelligence thing we're talking about
humans kind of have it what would be a

1292
00:27:54,530 --> 00:27:54,540
humans kind of have it what would be a
 

1293
00:27:54,540 --> 00:27:57,950
humans kind of have it what would be a
good test for you for touring develop a

1294
00:27:57,950 --> 00:27:57,960
good test for you for touring develop a
 

1295
00:27:57,960 --> 00:27:59,120
good test for you for touring develop a
test that's natural language

1296
00:27:59,120 --> 00:27:59,130
test that's natural language
 

1297
00:27:59,130 --> 00:28:01,550
test that's natural language
conversation would that impress you

1298
00:28:01,550 --> 00:28:01,560
conversation would that impress you
 

1299
00:28:01,560 --> 00:28:03,230
conversation would that impress you
a chatbot that you'd want to hang out

1300
00:28:03,230 --> 00:28:03,240
a chatbot that you'd want to hang out
 

1301
00:28:03,240 --> 00:28:05,930
a chatbot that you'd want to hang out
and have a beer with of you know for a

1302
00:28:05,930 --> 00:28:05,940
and have a beer with of you know for a
 

1303
00:28:05,940 --> 00:28:07,430
and have a beer with of you know for a
bunch of hours or have dinner plans with

1304
00:28:07,430 --> 00:28:07,440
bunch of hours or have dinner plans with
 

1305
00:28:07,440 --> 00:28:09,680
bunch of hours or have dinner plans with
with is that a good test natural energy

1306
00:28:09,680 --> 00:28:09,690
with is that a good test natural energy
 

1307
00:28:09,690 --> 00:28:10,880
with is that a good test natural energy
conversation is there something else

1308
00:28:10,880 --> 00:28:10,890
conversation is there something else
 

1309
00:28:10,890 --> 00:28:12,800
conversation is there something else
that would impress you or is that also

1310
00:28:12,800 --> 00:28:12,810
that would impress you or is that also
 

1311
00:28:12,810 --> 00:28:15,140
that would impress you or is that also
to differ yeah I'm pretty much impressed

1312
00:28:15,140 --> 00:28:15,150
to differ yeah I'm pretty much impressed
 

1313
00:28:15,150 --> 00:28:18,770
to differ yeah I'm pretty much impressed
by everything well I think if Roomba if

1314
00:28:18,770 --> 00:28:18,780
by everything well I think if Roomba if
 

1315
00:28:18,780 --> 00:28:20,720
by everything well I think if Roomba if
there was a chat bot that was like

1316
00:28:20,720 --> 00:28:20,730
there was a chat bot that was like
 

1317
00:28:20,730 --> 00:28:23,720
there was a chat bot that was like
incredibly and I don't know really had a

1318
00:28:23,720 --> 00:28:23,730
incredibly and I don't know really had a
 

1319
00:28:23,730 --> 00:28:27,080
incredibly and I don't know really had a
personality and I if I didn't be the the

1320
00:28:27,080 --> 00:28:27,090
personality and I if I didn't be the the
 

1321
00:28:27,090 --> 00:28:29,870
personality and I if I didn't be the the
Turing test right like if I'm unable to

1322
00:28:29,870 --> 00:28:29,880
Turing test right like if I'm unable to
 

1323
00:28:29,880 --> 00:28:33,440
Turing test right like if I'm unable to
tell that it's not another person but

1324
00:28:33,440 --> 00:28:33,450
tell that it's not another person but
 

1325
00:28:33,450 --> 00:28:37,480
tell that it's not another person but
then I was shown a bunch of wires and

1326
00:28:37,480 --> 00:28:37,490
then I was shown a bunch of wires and
 

1327
00:28:37,490 --> 00:28:39,530
then I was shown a bunch of wires and
mechanical components and then it was

1328
00:28:39,530 --> 00:28:39,540
mechanical components and then it was
 

1329
00:28:39,540 --> 00:28:40,940
mechanical components and then it was
like that's actually what's you're

1330
00:28:40,940 --> 00:28:40,950
like that's actually what's you're
 

1331
00:28:40,950 --> 00:28:43,970
like that's actually what's you're
talking to I don't know if I would feel

1332
00:28:43,970 --> 00:28:43,980
talking to I don't know if I would feel
 

1333
00:28:43,980 --> 00:28:46,820
talking to I don't know if I would feel
that guilty destroying it I would feel

1334
00:28:46,820 --> 00:28:46,830
that guilty destroying it I would feel
 

1335
00:28:46,830 --> 00:28:49,010
that guilty destroying it I would feel
guilty because clearly it's well-made

1336
00:28:49,010 --> 00:28:49,020
guilty because clearly it's well-made
 

1337
00:28:49,020 --> 00:28:50,420
guilty because clearly it's well-made
and it's a really cool thing

1338
00:28:50,420 --> 00:28:50,430
and it's a really cool thing
 

1339
00:28:50,430 --> 00:28:52,550
and it's a really cool thing
it's like destroying a really cool car

1340
00:28:52,550 --> 00:28:52,560
it's like destroying a really cool car
 

1341
00:28:52,560 --> 00:28:54,800
it's like destroying a really cool car
or something but I would not feel like I

1342
00:28:54,800 --> 00:28:54,810
or something but I would not feel like I
 

1343
00:28:54,810 --> 00:28:57,140
or something but I would not feel like I
was a murderer so yeah at what point

1344
00:28:57,140 --> 00:28:57,150
was a murderer so yeah at what point
 

1345
00:28:57,150 --> 00:28:59,150
was a murderer so yeah at what point
would I start to feel that way and and

1346
00:28:59,150 --> 00:28:59,160
would I start to feel that way and and
 

1347
00:28:59,160 --> 00:29:01,910
would I start to feel that way and and
this is such a subjective psychological

1348
00:29:01,910 --> 00:29:01,920
this is such a subjective psychological
 

1349
00:29:01,920 --> 00:29:05,270
this is such a subjective psychological
question if you give it movement or if

1350
00:29:05,270 --> 00:29:05,280
question if you give it movement or if
 

1351
00:29:05,280 --> 00:29:09,230
question if you give it movement or if
you have it mmm act as though or perhaps

1352
00:29:09,230 --> 00:29:09,240
you have it mmm act as though or perhaps
 

1353
00:29:09,240 --> 00:29:11,900
you have it mmm act as though or perhaps
really feel pain as I destroy it and

1354
00:29:11,900 --> 00:29:11,910
really feel pain as I destroy it and
 

1355
00:29:11,910 --> 00:29:15,500
really feel pain as I destroy it and
scream and resist then I'd feel that

1356
00:29:15,500 --> 00:29:15,510
scream and resist then I'd feel that
 

1357
00:29:15,510 --> 00:29:18,470
scream and resist then I'd feel that
yeah that's beautifully put and let's

1358
00:29:18,470 --> 00:29:18,480
yeah that's beautifully put and let's
 

1359
00:29:18,480 --> 00:29:21,260
yeah that's beautifully put and let's
just say act like it's in pain so if you

1360
00:29:21,260 --> 00:29:21,270
just say act like it's in pain so if you
 

1361
00:29:21,270 --> 00:29:25,520
just say act like it's in pain so if you
just have a robot that it's not screams

1362
00:29:25,520 --> 00:29:25,530
just have a robot that it's not screams
 

1363
00:29:25,530 --> 00:29:27,680
just have a robot that it's not screams
just like moans in pain if you kick it

1364
00:29:27,680 --> 00:29:27,690
just like moans in pain if you kick it
 

1365
00:29:27,690 --> 00:29:30,230
just like moans in pain if you kick it
yeah that immediately just puts it in a

1366
00:29:30,230 --> 00:29:30,240
yeah that immediately just puts it in a
 

1367
00:29:30,240 --> 00:29:34,190
yeah that immediately just puts it in a
class that we humans it becomes it we

1368
00:29:34,190 --> 00:29:34,200
class that we humans it becomes it we
 

1369
00:29:34,200 --> 00:29:36,110
class that we humans it becomes it we
anthropomorphize it almost immediately

1370
00:29:36,110 --> 00:29:36,120
anthropomorphize it almost immediately
 

1371
00:29:36,120 --> 00:29:38,930
anthropomorphize it almost immediately
it becomes human yeah that psychology

1372
00:29:38,930 --> 00:29:38,940
it becomes human yeah that psychology
 

1373
00:29:38,940 --> 00:29:40,490
it becomes human yeah that psychology
question as opposed to sort of a physics

1374
00:29:40,490 --> 00:29:40,500
question as opposed to sort of a physics
 

1375
00:29:40,500 --> 00:29:41,870
question as opposed to sort of a physics
question right I think that's a really

1376
00:29:41,870 --> 00:29:41,880
question right I think that's a really
 

1377
00:29:41,880 --> 00:29:43,370
question right I think that's a really
good instinct to have you know if the

1378
00:29:43,370 --> 00:29:43,380
good instinct to have you know if the
 

1379
00:29:43,380 --> 00:29:48,110
good instinct to have you know if the
robot screams screams and and and moans

1380
00:29:48,110 --> 00:29:48,120
robot screams screams and and and moans
 

1381
00:29:48,120 --> 00:29:50,720
robot screams screams and and and moans
even if you don't believe that it has

1382
00:29:50,720 --> 00:29:50,730
even if you don't believe that it has
 

1383
00:29:50,730 --> 00:29:53,960
even if you don't believe that it has
the mental experience the qualia of pain

1384
00:29:53,960 --> 00:29:53,970
the mental experience the qualia of pain
 

1385
00:29:53,970 --> 00:29:56,090
the mental experience the qualia of pain
and suffering I think it's still a good

1386
00:29:56,090 --> 00:29:56,100
and suffering I think it's still a good
 

1387
00:29:56,100 --> 00:29:57,380
and suffering I think it's still a good
instinct to say you know what I'd rather

1388
00:29:57,380 --> 00:29:57,390
instinct to say you know what I'd rather
 

1389
00:29:57,390 --> 00:30:01,700
instinct to say you know what I'd rather
not hurt it the problem is that instant

1390
00:30:01,700 --> 00:30:01,710
not hurt it the problem is that instant
 

1391
00:30:01,710 --> 00:30:03,110
not hurt it the problem is that instant
can get us in trouble because then

1392
00:30:03,110 --> 00:30:03,120
can get us in trouble because then
 

1393
00:30:03,120 --> 00:30:07,040
can get us in trouble because then
robots can manipulate that and you know

1394
00:30:07,040 --> 00:30:07,050
robots can manipulate that and you know
 

1395
00:30:07,050 --> 00:30:08,360
robots can manipulate that and you know
there's different kinds of robots as

1396
00:30:08,360 --> 00:30:08,370
there's different kinds of robots as
 

1397
00:30:08,370 --> 00:30:10,130
there's different kinds of robots as
robots like the Facebook and the YouTube

1398
00:30:10,130 --> 00:30:10,140
robots like the Facebook and the YouTube
 

1399
00:30:10,140 --> 00:30:11,840
robots like the Facebook and the YouTube
algorithm that recommends the video and

1400
00:30:11,840 --> 00:30:11,850
algorithm that recommends the video and
 

1401
00:30:11,850 --> 00:30:13,400
algorithm that recommends the video and
they can manipulate in the same kind of

1402
00:30:13,400 --> 00:30:13,410
they can manipulate in the same kind of
 

1403
00:30:13,410 --> 00:30:16,340
they can manipulate in the same kind of
way well let me ask you just to stick on

1404
00:30:16,340 --> 00:30:16,350
way well let me ask you just to stick on
 

1405
00:30:16,350 --> 00:30:17,990
way well let me ask you just to stick on
artificial intelligence for a second do

1406
00:30:17,990 --> 00:30:18,000
artificial intelligence for a second do
 

1407
00:30:18,000 --> 00:30:19,790
artificial intelligence for a second do
you have worries about existential

00:30:19,790 --> 00:30:19,800
you have worries about existential
 

1409
00:30:19,800 --> 00:30:22,790
you have worries about existential

other technologies like nuclear weapons
 

1413
00:30:24,570 --> 00:30:27,830

Earth or damage it to a very significant

1416
00:30:29,750 --> 00:30:29,760
Earth or damage it to a very significant
 

1417
00:30:29,760 --> 00:30:32,270
Earth or damage it to a very significant
degree yeah of course I do

1418
00:30:32,270 --> 00:30:32,280
degree yeah of course I do
 

1419
00:30:32,280 --> 00:30:34,520
degree yeah of course I do
especially the weapons that we create

1420
00:30:34,520 --> 00:30:34,530
especially the weapons that we create
 

1421
00:30:34,530 --> 00:30:37,280
especially the weapons that we create
there's all kinds of famous ways to

1422
00:30:37,280 --> 00:30:37,290
there's all kinds of famous ways to
 

1423
00:30:37,290 --> 00:30:39,290
there's all kinds of famous ways to
think about this and one is that Wow

1424
00:30:39,290 --> 00:30:39,300
think about this and one is that Wow
 

1425
00:30:39,300 --> 00:30:42,950
think about this and one is that Wow
what if we don't see advanced alien

1426
00:30:42,950 --> 00:30:42,960
what if we don't see advanced alien
 

1427
00:30:42,960 --> 00:30:48,820
what if we don't see advanced alien
civilizations because of the danger of

1428
00:30:48,820 --> 00:30:48,830

 

1429
00:30:48,830 --> 00:30:51,950

Technology what if we reach a point and

1430
00:30:51,950 --> 00:30:51,960
Technology what if we reach a point and
 

1431
00:30:51,960 --> 00:30:55,250
Technology what if we reach a point and
I think there's a channel-body to cheese

1432
00:30:55,250 --> 00:30:55,260
I think there's a channel-body to cheese
 

1433
00:30:55,260 --> 00:30:56,240
I think there's a channel-body to cheese
I wish I remember the name of the

1434
00:30:56,240 --> 00:30:56,250
I wish I remember the name of the
 

1435
00:30:56,250 --> 00:30:59,330
I wish I remember the name of the
channel but he delves into this this

1436
00:30:59,330 --> 00:30:59,340
channel but he delves into this this
 

1437
00:30:59,340 --> 00:31:00,890
channel but he delves into this this
kind of limit of maybe once you discover

1438
00:31:00,890 --> 00:31:00,900
kind of limit of maybe once you discover
 

1439
00:31:00,900 --> 00:31:05,120
kind of limit of maybe once you discover
radioactivity and its power you've

1440
00:31:05,120 --> 00:31:05,130
radioactivity and its power you've
 

1441
00:31:05,130 --> 00:31:07,430
radioactivity and its power you've
reached this important hurdle and the

1442
00:31:07,430 --> 00:31:07,440
reached this important hurdle and the
 

1443
00:31:07,440 --> 00:31:09,470
reached this important hurdle and the
reason that the skies are so empty is

1444
00:31:09,470 --> 00:31:09,480
reason that the skies are so empty is
 

1445
00:31:09,480 --> 00:31:12,200
reason that the skies are so empty is
that no one's ever like managed to

1446
00:31:12,200 --> 00:31:12,210
that no one's ever like managed to
 

1447
00:31:12,210 --> 00:31:14,540
that no one's ever like managed to
survive as a civilization once they have

1448
00:31:14,540 --> 00:31:14,550
survive as a civilization once they have
 

1449
00:31:14,550 --> 00:31:18,380
survive as a civilization once they have
that destructive power and when it comes

1450
00:31:18,380 --> 00:31:18,390
that destructive power and when it comes
 

1451
00:31:18,390 --> 00:31:22,010
that destructive power and when it comes
to AI I'm not really very worried

1452
00:31:22,010 --> 00:31:22,020
to AI I'm not really very worried
 

1453
00:31:22,020 --> 00:31:24,260
to AI I'm not really very worried
because I think that there are plenty of

1454
00:31:24,260 --> 00:31:24,270
because I think that there are plenty of
 

1455
00:31:24,270 --> 00:31:25,490
because I think that there are plenty of
other people that are already worried

1456
00:31:25,490 --> 00:31:25,500
other people that are already worried
 

1457
00:31:25,500 --> 00:31:28,720
other people that are already worried
enough and oftentimes these worries are

1458
00:31:28,720 --> 00:31:28,730
enough and oftentimes these worries are
 

1459
00:31:28,730 --> 00:31:31,370
enough and oftentimes these worries are
just they just get in the way of

1460
00:31:31,370 --> 00:31:31,380
just they just get in the way of
 

1461
00:31:31,380 --> 00:31:33,799
just they just get in the way of
progress and they're there questions

1462
00:31:33,799 --> 00:31:33,809
progress and they're there questions
 

1463
00:31:33,809 --> 00:31:38,750
progress and they're there questions
that we should address later and you

1464
00:31:38,750 --> 00:31:38,760
that we should address later and you
 

1465
00:31:38,760 --> 00:31:41,419
that we should address later and you
know I think I talked about this in my

1466
00:31:41,419 --> 00:31:41,429
know I think I talked about this in my
 

1467
00:31:41,429 --> 00:31:45,020
know I think I talked about this in my
interview with the self-driving

1468
00:31:45,020 --> 00:31:45,030
interview with the self-driving
 

1469
00:31:45,030 --> 00:31:48,020
interview with the self-driving
autonomous vehicle guy as I think it was

1470
00:31:48,020 --> 00:31:48,030
autonomous vehicle guy as I think it was
 

1471
00:31:48,030 --> 00:31:50,810
autonomous vehicle guy as I think it was
a bonus scene from the trolley problem

1472
00:31:50,810 --> 00:31:50,820
a bonus scene from the trolley problem
 

1473
00:31:50,820 --> 00:31:53,419
a bonus scene from the trolley problem
episode and I'm like wow what should a

1474
00:31:53,419 --> 00:31:53,429
episode and I'm like wow what should a
 

1475
00:31:53,429 --> 00:31:55,460
episode and I'm like wow what should a
car do if like this really weird

1476
00:31:55,460 --> 00:31:55,470
car do if like this really weird
 

1477
00:31:55,470 --> 00:31:57,290
car do if like this really weird
contrived scenario happens where it has

1478
00:31:57,290 --> 00:31:57,300
contrived scenario happens where it has
 

1479
00:31:57,300 --> 00:31:59,150
contrived scenario happens where it has
to like swerve and like save the driver

1480
00:31:59,150 --> 00:31:59,160
to like swerve and like save the driver
 

1481
00:31:59,160 --> 00:32:01,010

but kill a kid and he's like well you

1482
00:32:01,010 --> 00:32:01,020
but kill a kid and he's like well you
 

1483
00:32:01,020 --> 00:32:04,430
but kill a kid and he's like well you
know what would a human do and if we

1484
00:32:04,430 --> 00:32:04,440
know what would a human do and if we
 

1485
00:32:04,440 --> 00:32:07,490
know what would a human do and if we
resist technological progress because

1486
00:32:07,490 --> 00:32:07,500
resist technological progress because
 

1487
00:32:07,500 --> 00:32:09,020
resist technological progress because
we're worried about all of these little

1488
00:32:09,020 --> 00:32:09,030
we're worried about all of these little
 

1489
00:32:09,030 --> 00:32:12,440
we're worried about all of these little
issues then it gets in the way and we

issues then it gets in the way and we
 

1491
00:32:12,450 --> 00:32:14,570
issues then it gets in the way and we
shouldn't avoid those problems but we

1492
00:32:14,570 --> 00:32:14,580
shouldn't avoid those problems but we
 

1493
00:32:14,580 --> 00:32:16,040
shouldn't avoid those problems but we
shouldn't allow them to be stumbling

1494
00:32:16,040 --> 00:32:16,050
shouldn't allow them to be stumbling
 

1495
00:32:16,050 --> 00:32:16,880
shouldn't allow them to be stumbling
blocks

1496
00:32:16,880 --> 00:32:16,890
blocks
 

1497
00:32:16,890 --> 00:32:20,600
blocks
- advancement so the you know folks like

1498
00:32:20,600 --> 00:32:20,610
- advancement so the you know folks like
 

1499
00:32:20,610 --> 00:32:23,000
- advancement so the you know folks like
Sam Harris or Elon Musk are saying that

1500
00:32:23,000 --> 00:32:23,010
Sam Harris or Elon Musk are saying that
 

1501
00:32:23,010 --> 00:32:25,550
Sam Harris or Elon Musk are saying that
we're not worried enough so worried

1502
00:32:25,550 --> 00:32:25,560
we're not worried enough so worried
 

1503
00:32:25,560 --> 00:32:27,470
we're not worried enough so worried
should not paralyze technological

1504
00:32:27,470 --> 00:32:27,480
should not paralyze technological
 

1505
00:32:27,480 --> 00:32:30,400
should not paralyze technological
progress but we're sort of marching

1506
00:32:30,400 --> 00:32:30,410
progress but we're sort of marching
 

1507
00:32:30,410 --> 00:32:33,370
progress but we're sort of marching
technologies marching forward without

1508
00:32:33,370 --> 00:32:33,380
technologies marching forward without
 

1509
00:32:33,380 --> 00:32:36,650
technologies marching forward without
the key scientists the developing and

1510
00:32:36,650 --> 00:32:36,660
the key scientists the developing and
 

1511
00:32:36,660 --> 00:32:40,390
the key scientists the developing and
technology worrying about the overnight

1512
00:32:40,390 --> 00:32:40,400
technology worrying about the overnight
 

1513
00:32:40,400 --> 00:32:43,430
technology worrying about the overnight
having some effects that would be very

1514
00:32:43,430 --> 00:32:43,440
having some effects that would be very
 

1515
00:32:43,440 --> 00:32:47,030
having some effects that would be very
detrimental to society so the push back

1516
00:32:47,030 --> 00:32:47,040
detrimental to society so the push back
 

1517
00:32:47,040 --> 00:32:49,820
detrimental to society so the push back
on your thought of the idea that there's

1518
00:32:49,820 --> 00:32:49,830
on your thought of the idea that there's
 

1519
00:32:49,830 --> 00:32:51,530
on your thought of the idea that there's
enough people worrying about it Elon

1520
00:32:51,530 --> 00:32:51,540
enough people worrying about it Elon
 

1521
00:32:51,540 --> 00:32:52,850
enough people worrying about it Elon
Musk says there's not enough people

1522
00:32:52,850 --> 00:32:52,860
Musk says there's not enough people
 

1523
00:32:52,860 --> 00:32:55,010
Musk says there's not enough people
worrying about it I think that's the

1524
00:32:55,010 --> 00:32:55,020
worrying about it I think that's the
 

1525
00:32:55,020 --> 00:32:59,150
worrying about it I think that's the
kind of balances you know it's like

1526
00:32:59,150 --> 00:32:59,160
kind of balances you know it's like
 

1527
00:32:59,160 --> 00:33:01,910
kind of balances you know it's like
folks to who really focused on nuclear

1528
00:33:01,910 --> 00:33:01,920
folks to who really focused on nuclear
 

1529
00:33:01,920 --> 00:33:04,220
folks to who really focused on nuclear
deterrence are saying there's not enough

1530
00:33:04,220 --> 00:33:04,230
deterrence are saying there's not enough
 

1531
00:33:04,230 --> 00:33:05,780
deterrence are saying there's not enough
people worried about nuclear deterrence

1532
00:33:05,780 --> 00:33:05,790
people worried about nuclear deterrence
 

1533
00:33:05,790 --> 00:33:07,820
people worried about nuclear deterrence
right so it's an interesting question of

1534
00:33:07,820 --> 00:33:07,830
right so it's an interesting question of
 

1535
00:33:07,830 --> 00:33:10,880
right so it's an interesting question of
what is a good threshold of people to

1536
00:33:10,880 --> 00:33:10,890
what is a good threshold of people to
 

1537
00:33:10,890 --> 00:33:13,490
what is a good threshold of people to
worry about these and if it's too many

1538
00:33:13,490 --> 00:33:13,500
worry about these and if it's too many
 

1539
00:33:13,500 --> 00:33:14,930
worry about these and if it's too many
people that are worried you're right

1540
00:33:14,930 --> 00:33:14,940
people that are worried you're right
 

1541
00:33:14,940 --> 00:33:18,050
people that are worried you're right
it'll be like the the press would over

1542
00:33:18,050 --> 00:33:18,060
it'll be like the the press would over
 

1543
00:33:18,060 --> 00:33:19,120
it'll be like the the press would over
report on it and there'll be

1544
00:33:19,120 --> 00:33:19,130
report on it and there'll be
 

1545
00:33:19,130 --> 00:33:21,620
report on it and there'll be
technological halt technology progress

1546
00:33:21,620 --> 00:33:21,630
technological halt technology progress
 

1547
00:33:21,630 --> 00:33:24,080
technological halt technology progress
if not enough then we can march straight

1548
00:33:24,080 --> 00:33:24,090
if not enough then we can march straight
 

1549
00:33:24,090 --> 00:33:27,770
if not enough then we can march straight
ahead into that abyss that human beings

1550
00:33:27,770 --> 00:33:27,780
ahead into that abyss that human beings
 

1551
00:33:27,780 --> 00:33:30,470
ahead into that abyss that human beings
might be destined for with the progress

1552
00:33:30,470 --> 00:33:30,480
might be destined for with the progress
 

1553
00:33:30,480 --> 00:33:32,360
might be destined for with the progress
of technology yeah I don't know what the

1554
00:33:32,360 --> 00:33:32,370
of technology yeah I don't know what the
 

1555
00:33:32,370 --> 00:33:34,640
of technology yeah I don't know what the
right balance is of how many people

1556
00:33:34,640 --> 00:33:34,650
right balance is of how many people
 

1557
00:33:34,650 --> 00:33:36,530
right balance is of how many people
should be worried and how worried should

1558
00:33:36,530 --> 00:33:36,540
should be worried and how worried should
 

1559
00:33:36,540 --> 00:33:38,540
should be worried and how worried should
they be but we're always worried about

1560
00:33:38,540 --> 00:33:38,550
they be but we're always worried about
 

1561
00:33:38,550 --> 00:33:40,730
they be but we're always worried about
new technology you know we know that

1562
00:33:40,730 --> 00:33:40,740
new technology you know we know that
 

1563
00:33:40,740 --> 00:33:42,350
new technology you know we know that
Plato was worried about the written word

1564
00:33:42,350 --> 00:33:42,360
Plato was worried about the written word
 

1565
00:33:42,360 --> 00:33:44,510
Plato was worried about the written word
he's like we shouldn't teach people to

1566
00:33:44,510 --> 00:33:44,520
he's like we shouldn't teach people to
 

1567
00:33:44,520 --> 00:33:46,190
he's like we shouldn't teach people to
write because then they won't use their

1568
00:33:46,190 --> 00:33:46,200
write because then they won't use their
 

1569
00:33:46,200 --> 00:33:48,470
write because then they won't use their
minds to remember things there there

1570
00:33:48,470 --> 00:33:48,480
minds to remember things there there

have been concerns over technology and

1572
00:33:50,780 --> 00:33:50,790
have been concerns over technology and
 

1573
00:33:50,790 --> 00:33:53,840
have been concerns over technology and
its advancement since the beginning of

1574

its advancement since the beginning of
 

1575
00:33:53,850 --> 00:33:57,160
its advancement since the beginning of
recorded history and so you know I think

recorded history and so you know I think
 

1577
00:33:57,170 --> 00:34:00,230
recorded history and so you know I think
however these conversations are really

however these conversations are really
 

1579
00:34:00,240 --> 00:34:01,700
however these conversations are really
important to have because again we learn

1580
00:34:01,700 --> 00:34:01,710
important to have because again we learn
 

1581
00:34:01,710 --> 00:34:03,830
important to have because again we learn
a lot about ourselves if we're really

1582
00:34:03,830 --> 00:34:03,840
a lot about ourselves if we're really
 

1583
00:34:03,840 --> 00:34:06,800
a lot about ourselves if we're really
scared of some kind of AI like coming

1584
00:34:06,800 --> 00:34:06,810
scared of some kind of AI like coming
 

1585
00:34:06,810 --> 00:34:09,169
scared of some kind of AI like coming
into being that is conscious or whatever

interesting also notion the stories we
 

1681
00:36:12,690 --> 00:36:14,300
interesting also notion the stories we
tell ourselves I like the one where

1682
00:36:14,300 --> 00:36:14,310
tell ourselves I like the one where
 

1683
00:36:14,310 --> 00:36:16,820
tell ourselves I like the one where
individuals matter but it's unclear that

1684
00:36:16,820 --> 00:36:16,830
individuals matter but it's unclear that
 

1685
00:36:16,830 --> 00:36:19,880
individuals matter but it's unclear that
that was what the future holds well yeah

1686
00:36:19,880 --> 00:36:19,890
that was what the future holds well yeah
 

1687
00:36:19,890 --> 00:36:21,350
that was what the future holds well yeah
and I mean let me even throw this out

1688
00:36:21,350 --> 00:36:21,360
and I mean let me even throw this out
 

1689
00:36:21,360 --> 00:36:23,990
and I mean let me even throw this out
like what is artificial intelligence how

1690
00:36:23,990 --> 00:36:24,000
like what is artificial intelligence how
 

1691
00:36:24,000 --> 00:36:25,910
like what is artificial intelligence how
can it be artificial I really think that

1692
00:36:25,910 --> 00:36:25,920
can it be artificial I really think that
 

1693
00:36:25,920 --> 00:36:28,580
can it be artificial I really think that
we get pretty obsessed and stuck on the

1694
00:36:28,580 --> 00:36:28,590
we get pretty obsessed and stuck on the
 

1695
00:36:28,590 --> 00:36:30,980
we get pretty obsessed and stuck on the
idea that there is some thing that is a

1696
00:36:30,980 --> 00:36:30,990
idea that there is some thing that is a
 

1697
00:36:30,990 --> 00:36:34,640
idea that there is some thing that is a
wild human a pure human organism without

wild human a pure human organism without
 

1699
00:36:34,650 --> 00:36:37,520
wild human a pure human organism without
technology but I don't think that's a

1700
00:36:37,520 --> 00:36:37,530
technology but I don't think that's a
 

1701
00:36:37,530 --> 00:36:38,060
technology but I don't think that's a
real thing

1702
00:36:38,060 --> 00:36:38,070
real thing
 

1703
00:36:38,070 --> 00:36:41,090
real thing
I think that humans and human technology

1704
00:36:41,090 --> 00:36:41,100
I think that humans and human technology
 

1705
00:36:41,100 --> 00:36:42,550
I think that humans and human technology
are one or

1706
00:36:42,550 --> 00:36:42,560
are one or
 

1707
00:36:42,560 --> 00:36:45,460
are one or
Gizem look at my glasses okay if an

1708
00:36:45,460 --> 00:36:45,470
Gizem look at my glasses okay if an
 

1709
00:36:45,470 --> 00:36:48,910
Gizem look at my glasses okay if an
alien came down and saw me would they

1710
00:36:48,910 --> 00:36:48,920
alien came down and saw me would they
 

1711
00:36:48,920 --> 00:36:50,470
alien came down and saw me would they
necessarily know that this is an

1712
00:36:50,470 --> 00:36:50,480
necessarily know that this is an
 

1713
00:36:50,480 --> 00:36:52,600
necessarily know that this is an
invention that I don't grow these

1714
00:36:52,600 --> 00:36:52,610
invention that I don't grow these
 

1715
00:36:52,610 --> 00:36:54,280
invention that I don't grow these
organically from my body they wouldn't

1716
00:36:54,280 --> 00:36:54,290
organically from my body they wouldn't
 

1717
00:36:54,290 --> 00:36:57,700
organically from my body they wouldn't
know that right away and the written

1718
00:36:57,700 --> 00:36:57,710
know that right away and the written
 

1719
00:36:57,710 --> 00:37:01,510
know that right away and the written
word and spoons and cups these are all

1720
00:37:01,510 --> 00:37:01,520
word and spoons and cups these are all
 

1721
00:37:01,520 --> 00:37:06,850
word and spoons and cups these are all
pieces of technology we are not alone as

1722
00:37:06,850 --> 00:37:06,860
pieces of technology we are not alone as
 

1723
00:37:06,860 --> 00:37:09,910
pieces of technology we are not alone as
an organism and so the technology we

1724
00:37:09,910 --> 00:37:09,920
an organism and so the technology we
 

1725
00:37:09,920 --> 00:37:12,250
an organism and so the technology we
create whether it be video games or

1726
00:37:12,250 --> 00:37:12,260
create whether it be video games or
 

1727
00:37:12,260 --> 00:37:14,110
create whether it be video games or
artificial intelligence that can

1728
00:37:14,110 --> 00:37:14,120
artificial intelligence that can
 

1729
00:37:14,120 --> 00:37:16,240
artificial intelligence that can
self-replicate and hate us it's actually

1730
00:37:16,240 --> 00:37:16,250
self-replicate and hate us it's actually
 

1731
00:37:16,250 --> 00:37:19,120
self-replicate and hate us it's actually
all the same organism I when you're in a

all the same organism I when you're in a
car where do you end in the car begin it

1734
00:37:21,130 --> 00:37:21,140
car where do you end in the car begin it
 

1735

seems like a really easy question to
 

1737
00:37:22,340 --> 00:37:24,310
seems like a really easy question to
answer but the more you think about it

1738
00:37:24,310 --> 00:37:24,320

symbiotic relationship with our
 

1743
00:37:28,730 --> 00:37:30,820
symbiotic relationship with our
inventions and there are plenty of

1744
00:37:30,820 --> 00:37:30,830
inventions and there are plenty of
 

1745
00:37:30,830 --> 00:37:32,020
inventions and there are plenty of
people who are worried about it and

1746
00:37:32,020 --> 00:37:32,030
people who are worried about it and
 

1747

00:37:37,780 --> 00:37:37,790
and I think the even just us think of
 

1751
00:37:37,790 --> 00:37:41,290
and I think the even just us think of
ourselves as individual intelligences

1752

I try to approach it with a lot of
 

1903

I try to approach it with a lot of
humility and sharing like I'm not out

experiments I am sharing the work of
 

1909
00:41:21,840 --> 00:41:24,140
experiments I am sharing the work of
real scientists and I'm celebrating

1910
00:41:24,140 --> 00:41:24,150
real scientists and I'm celebrating
 

1911
00:41:24,150 --> 00:41:25,670
real scientists and I'm celebrating
their work and the way that they think

1912
00:41:25,670 --> 00:41:25,680
their work and the way that they think
 

1913
00:41:25,680 --> 00:41:30,200
their work and the way that they think
and the power of curiosity but I want to

1914
00:41:30,200 --> 00:41:30,210
and the power of curiosity but I want to
 

1915
00:41:30,210 --> 00:41:32,090
and the power of curiosity but I want to
make it clear at all times that like

1916
00:41:32,090 --> 00:41:32,100
make it clear at all times that like
 

1917
00:41:32,100 --> 00:41:34,640
make it clear at all times that like
look you know we don't know all the

1918
00:41:34,640 --> 00:41:34,650
look you know we don't know all the
 

1919
00:41:34,650 --> 00:41:35,900
look you know we don't know all the
answers and I don't think we're ever

1920
00:41:35,900 --> 00:41:35,910
answers and I don't think we're ever
 

1921
00:41:35,910 --> 00:41:38,060
answers and I don't think we're ever
going to reach a point where we're like

1922
00:41:38,060 --> 00:41:38,070
going to reach a point where we're like
 

1923
00:41:38,070 --> 00:41:40,340
going to reach a point where we're like
wow and there you go that's the universe

1924
00:41:40,340 --> 00:41:40,350
wow and there you go that's the universe
 

1925
00:41:40,350 --> 00:41:42,110
wow and there you go that's the universe
it's this equation you plug in some

1926
00:41:42,110 --> 00:41:42,120
it's this equation you plug in some
 

1927
00:41:42,120 --> 00:41:44,270
it's this equation you plug in some
conditions or whatever and you do the

1928
00:41:44,270 --> 00:41:44,280
conditions or whatever and you do the
 

1929
00:41:44,280 --> 00:41:45,200
conditions or whatever and you do the
math and you know what's gonna happen

1930
00:41:45,200 --> 00:41:45,210
math and you know what's gonna happen
 

1931
00:41:45,210 --> 00:41:46,790
math and you know what's gonna happen
tomorrow I don't think we're gonna reach

1932
00:41:46,790 --> 00:41:46,800
tomorrow I don't think we're gonna reach
 

1933
00:41:46,800 --> 00:41:51,020
tomorrow I don't think we're gonna reach
that point but I I think that there is a

1934
00:41:51,020 --> 00:41:51,030
that point but I I think that there is a
 

1935
00:41:51,030 --> 00:41:54,500
that point but I I think that there is a
tendency to sometimes believe in science

1936
00:41:54,500 --> 00:41:54,510
tendency to sometimes believe in science
 

1937
00:41:54,510 --> 00:41:57,260
tendency to sometimes believe in science
and become elitist and become I don't

1938
00:41:57,260 --> 00:41:57,270
and become elitist and become I don't
 

1939
00:41:57,270 --> 00:41:59,150
and become elitist and become I don't
know hard when in reality it should

1940
00:41:59,150 --> 00:41:59,160
know hard when in reality it should
 

1941
00:41:59,160 --> 00:42:01,490
know hard when in reality it should
humble you and make you feel smaller I

1942
00:42:01,490 --> 00:42:01,500
humble you and make you feel smaller I
 

1943
00:42:01,500 --> 00:42:02,690
humble you and make you feel smaller I
think there's something very beautiful

1944
00:42:02,690 --> 00:42:02,700
think there's something very beautiful
 

1945
00:42:02,700 --> 00:42:05,510
think there's something very beautiful
about feeling very very small and very

1946
00:42:05,510 --> 00:42:05,520
about feeling very very small and very
 

1947
00:42:05,520 --> 00:42:09,410
about feeling very very small and very
weak and to feel that you need other

1948
00:42:09,410 --> 00:42:09,420
weak and to feel that you need other
 

1949
00:42:09,420 --> 00:42:12,800
weak and to feel that you need other
people hmm so I try to keep that in mind

1950
00:42:12,800 --> 00:42:12,810
people hmm so I try to keep that in mind
 

1951
00:42:12,810 --> 00:42:14,660
people hmm so I try to keep that in mind
and say look thanks for watching Vsauce

1952
00:42:14,660 --> 00:42:14,670
and say look thanks for watching Vsauce
 

1953
00:42:14,670 --> 00:42:15,950
and say look thanks for watching Vsauce
is not I'm not Vsauce

1954
00:42:15,950 --> 00:42:15,960
is not I'm not Vsauce
 

1955
00:42:15,960 --> 00:42:17,990
is not I'm not Vsauce
you are when I start the episodes I say

1956
00:42:17,990 --> 00:42:18,000
you are when I start the episodes I say
 

1957
00:42:18,000 --> 00:42:19,940
you are when I start the episodes I say
hey Vsauce Michael here

1958
00:42:19,940 --> 00:42:19,950
hey Vsauce Michael here
 

1959
00:42:19,950 --> 00:42:21,650
hey Vsauce Michael here
Vsauce and Michaels are actually a

1960
00:42:21,650 --> 00:42:21,660
Vsauce and Michaels are actually a
 

1961
00:42:21,660 --> 00:42:22,940
Vsauce and Michaels are actually a
different thing in my mind I don't know

1962
00:42:22,940 --> 00:42:22,950
different thing in my mind I don't know
 

1963
00:42:22,950 --> 00:42:25,580
different thing in my mind I don't know
if that's always clear but yeah I have

1964
00:42:25,580 --> 00:42:25,590
if that's always clear but yeah I have
 

1965
00:42:25,590 --> 00:42:28,370
if that's always clear but yeah I have
to approach it that way because it's not

1966
00:42:28,370 --> 00:42:28,380
to approach it that way because it's not
 

1967
00:42:28,380 --> 00:42:32,240
to approach it that way because it's not
about me yeah so it's not even you're

1968
00:42:32,240 --> 00:42:32,250
about me yeah so it's not even you're
 

1969
00:42:32,250 --> 00:42:33,740
about me yeah so it's not even you're
not feeling the responsibility you're

1970
00:42:33,740 --> 00:42:33,750
not feeling the responsibility you're
 

1971
00:42:33,750 --> 00:42:35,480
not feeling the responsibility you're
just sort of plugging into this big

1972
00:42:35,480 --> 00:42:35,490
just sort of plugging into this big
 

1973
00:42:35,490 --> 00:42:38,720
just sort of plugging into this big
thing that is scientific exploration of

1974
00:42:38,720 --> 00:42:38,730
thing that is scientific exploration of
 

1975
00:42:38,730 --> 00:42:41,360
thing that is scientific exploration of
our reality and you're a voice that

1976
00:42:41,360 --> 00:42:41,370
our reality and you're a voice that
 

1977
00:42:41,370 --> 00:42:43,550
our reality and you're a voice that
represents a bunch but you're just

1978
00:42:43,550 --> 00:42:43,560
represents a bunch but you're just
 

1979
00:42:43,560 --> 00:42:47,780
represents a bunch but you're just
plugging into this big Vsauce ball that

1980
00:42:47,780 --> 00:42:47,790
plugging into this big Vsauce ball that
 

1981
00:42:47,790 --> 00:42:49,400
plugging into this big Vsauce ball that
others millions of others have plugged

1982
00:42:49,400 --> 00:42:49,410
others millions of others have plugged
 

1983
00:42:49,410 --> 00:42:51,760
others millions of others have plugged
into yeah I'm just hoping to encourage

1984
00:42:51,760 --> 00:42:51,770
into yeah I'm just hoping to encourage
 

1985
00:42:51,770 --> 00:42:55,180
into yeah I'm just hoping to encourage
curiosity and you know we're responsible

1986
00:42:55,180 --> 00:42:55,190
curiosity and you know we're responsible

let me ask first high level do you have

2002
00:43:20,420 --> 00:43:20,430
let me ask first high level do you have
 

2003
00:43:20,430 --> 00:43:23,320
let me ask first high level do you have
do you have a question

2004
00:43:23,320 --> 00:43:23,330
do you have a question
 

2005
00:43:23,330 --> 00:43:26,210
do you have a question
for him that if you can get an ounce

2006
00:43:26,210 --> 00:43:26,220
for him that if you can get an ounce
 

2007
00:43:26,220 --> 00:43:29,000
for him that if you can get an ounce
honest answer that you would ask but

2008
00:43:29,000 --> 00:43:29,010
honest answer that you would ask but
 

2009
00:43:29,010 --> 00:43:30,980
honest answer that you would ask but
more generally how do you think about

2010
00:43:30,980 --> 00:43:30,990
more generally how do you think about
 

2011
00:43:30,990 --> 00:43:33,800
more generally how do you think about
the YouTube algorithm that drives some

2012
00:43:33,800 --> 00:43:33,810
the YouTube algorithm that drives some
 

2013
00:43:33,810 --> 00:43:36,590
the YouTube algorithm that drives some
of the motivation behind not know some

2014
00:43:36,590 --> 00:43:36,600
of the motivation behind not know some
 

2015
00:43:36,600 --> 00:43:39,380
of the motivation behind not know some
of the design decisions you make as you

2016
00:43:39,380 --> 00:43:39,390
of the design decisions you make as you
 

2017
00:43:39,390 --> 00:43:41,390
of the design decisions you make as you
ask and answer some of the questions you

2018
00:43:41,390 --> 00:43:41,400
ask and answer some of the questions you
 

2019
00:43:41,400 --> 00:43:43,760
ask and answer some of the questions you
do how would you improve this algorithm

2020
00:43:43,760 --> 00:43:43,770
do how would you improve this algorithm
 

2021
00:43:43,770 --> 00:43:46,190
do how would you improve this algorithm
in your mind in general so just the what

2022
00:43:46,190 --> 00:43:46,200
in your mind in general so just the what
 

2023
00:43:46,200 --> 00:43:48,770
in your mind in general so just the what
would you ask him and outside of that

2024
00:43:48,770 --> 00:43:48,780
would you ask him and outside of that
 

2025
00:43:48,780 --> 00:43:50,840
would you ask him and outside of that
how would you like to see the algorithm

2026
00:43:50,840 --> 00:43:50,850
how would you like to see the algorithm
 

2027
00:43:50,850 --> 00:43:54,050
how would you like to see the algorithm
improve well I think of the algorithm as

2028
00:43:54,050 --> 00:43:54,060
improve well I think of the algorithm as
 

2029
00:43:54,060 --> 00:43:58,460
improve well I think of the algorithm as
a mirror it reflects what people put in

2030
00:43:58,460 --> 00:43:58,470
a mirror it reflects what people put in
 

2031
00:43:58,470 --> 00:44:00,470
a mirror it reflects what people put in
and we don't always like what we see in

2032
00:44:00,470 --> 00:44:00,480

in the aggregate it's reflecting back

2040
00:44:07,910 --> 00:44:07,920
in the aggregate it's reflecting back
 

2041
00:44:07,920 --> 00:44:10,790
in the aggregate it's reflecting back
what people on average want to watch and

2042

when you see things being recommended to
 

2045
00:44:14,370 --> 00:44:17,150
when you see things being recommended to
you it's reflecting back what it thinks

2046
00:44:17,150 --> 00:44:17,160
you it's reflecting back what it thinks
 

2047
00:44:17,160 --> 00:44:20,750
you it's reflecting back what it thinks
you want to see and specifically I would

2048
00:44:20,750 --> 00:44:20,760
you want to see and specifically I would
 

2049
00:44:20,760 --> 00:44:23,150
you want to see and specifically I would
guess that it's not just what you want

2050
00:44:23,150 --> 00:44:23,160
guess that it's not just what you want
 

2051
00:44:23,160 --> 00:44:25,220
guess that it's not just what you want
to see but what you will click on and

2052
00:44:25,220 --> 00:44:25,230
to see but what you will click on and
 

2053
00:44:25,230 --> 00:44:29,390
to see but what you will click on and
what you will watch some of and stay on

2054
00:44:29,390 --> 00:44:29,400
what you will watch some of and stay on
 

2055
00:44:29,400 --> 00:44:33,230
what you will watch some of and stay on
YouTube because of I don't think that is

2056
00:44:33,230 --> 00:44:33,240
YouTube because of I don't think that is
 

2057
00:44:33,240 --> 00:44:35,830
YouTube because of I don't think that is
all me guessing but I don't think that

2058
00:44:35,830 --> 00:44:35,840
all me guessing but I don't think that
 

2059
00:44:35,840 --> 00:44:39,950
all me guessing but I don't think that
YouTube cares if you only watch like a

2060
00:44:39,950 --> 00:44:39,960
YouTube cares if you only watch like a
 

2061
00:44:39,960 --> 00:44:42,770
YouTube cares if you only watch like a
second of a video as long as the next

2062
00:44:42,770 --> 00:44:42,780
second of a video as long as the next
 

2063
00:44:42,780 --> 00:44:44,620
second of a video as long as the next
thing you do is open another video if

2064
00:44:44,620 --> 00:44:44,630
thing you do is open another video if
 

2065
00:44:44,630 --> 00:44:49,160
thing you do is open another video if
you close the app or close the site

2066
00:44:49,160 --> 00:44:49,170
you close the app or close the site
 

2067
00:44:49,170 --> 00:44:50,870
you close the app or close the site
that's a problem for them because

2068
00:44:50,870 --> 00:44:50,880
that's a problem for them because
 

2069
00:44:50,880 --> 00:44:52,070
that's a problem for them because
they're not a subscription platform

2070
00:44:52,070 --> 00:44:52,080
they're not a subscription platform
 

2071
00:44:52,080 --> 00:44:54,260
they're not a subscription platform
they're not like look you're giving us

they're not like look you're giving us
20 bucks a month no matter what so who

20 bucks a month no matter what so who
 

2075
00:44:56,670 --> 00:45:00,350

time there and see ads so what one of

2078
00:45:02,630 --> 00:45:02,640
time there and see ads so what one of
 

2079
00:45:02,640 --> 00:45:03,800
time there and see ads so what one of
the things I'm curious about whether

2080
00:45:03,800 --> 00:45:03,810
the things I'm curious about whether
 

2081
00:45:03,810 --> 00:45:09,110
the things I'm curious about whether
they do consider longer term sort of

2082
00:45:09,110 --> 00:45:09,120
they do consider longer term sort of
 

2083
00:45:09,120 --> 00:45:11,360
they do consider longer term sort of
develop you your longer-term development

2084
00:45:11,360 --> 00:45:11,370
develop you your longer-term development
 

2085
00:45:11,370 --> 00:45:13,280
develop you your longer-term development
as a human being which I think

2086
00:45:13,280 --> 00:45:13,290
as a human being which I think
 

2087
00:45:13,290 --> 00:45:14,930
as a human being which I think
ultimately will make you feel better

2088
00:45:14,930 --> 00:45:14,940
ultimately will make you feel better
 

2089
00:45:14,940 --> 00:45:17,420
ultimately will make you feel better
about using YouTube in the long term and

2090
00:45:17,420 --> 00:45:17,430
about using YouTube in the long term and
 

2091
00:45:17,430 --> 00:45:19,400
about using YouTube in the long term and
allowing you to stick with it for longer

2092
00:45:19,400 --> 00:45:19,410
allowing you to stick with it for longer
 

2093
00:45:19,410 --> 00:45:21,890
allowing you to stick with it for longer
because even if you feed the dopamine

2094
00:45:21,890 --> 00:45:21,900
because even if you feed the dopamine
 

2095
00:45:21,900 --> 00:45:23,660
because even if you feed the dopamine
rush in the short-term and you keep

2096
00:45:23,660 --> 00:45:23,670
rush in the short-term and you keep
 

2097
00:45:23,670 --> 00:45:27,200
rush in the short-term and you keep
clicking on cat videos the eventually

2098
00:45:27,200 --> 00:45:27,210
clicking on cat videos the eventually

you sort of wake up like from a drug and

2100
00:45:29,090 --> 00:45:29,100
you sort of wake up like from a drug and
 

2101
00:45:29,100 --> 00:45:31,640
you sort of wake up like from a drug and
say I need to quit this so I wonder how

2102
00:45:31,640 --> 00:45:31,650
say I need to quit this so I wonder how
 

2103
00:45:31,650 --> 00:45:32,840
say I need to quit this so I wonder how
much they're trying to optimize for the

2104
00:45:32,840 --> 00:45:32,850
much they're trying to optimize for the
 

2105
00:45:32,850 --> 00:45:35,600
much they're trying to optimize for the
long term because when I look at the you

2106
00:45:35,600 --> 00:45:35,610
long term because when I look at the you
 

2107
00:45:35,610 --> 00:45:37,130
long term because when I look at the you
know your videos aren't

2108
00:45:37,130 --> 00:45:37,140
know your videos aren't
 

2109
00:45:37,140 --> 00:45:39,800
know your videos aren't
and sort of no offense but they're not

2110
00:45:39,800 --> 00:45:39,810
and sort of no offense but they're not
 

2111
00:45:39,810 --> 00:45:43,100
and sort of no offense but they're not
the most clickable they're both the most

2112
00:45:43,100 --> 00:45:43,110
the most clickable they're both the most
 

2113
00:45:43,110 --> 00:45:46,910
the most clickable they're both the most
clickable and I feel I watch the entire

2114
00:45:46,910 --> 00:45:46,920
clickable and I feel I watch the entire
 

2115
00:45:46,920 --> 00:45:48,740
clickable and I feel I watch the entire
thing and I feel a better human after I

2116
00:45:48,740 --> 00:45:48,750
thing and I feel a better human after I
 

2117
00:45:48,750 --> 00:45:50,690
thing and I feel a better human after I
watch it right so like they're not for

2118
00:45:50,690 --> 00:45:50,700
watch it right so like they're not for
 

2119
00:45:50,700 --> 00:45:55,660
watch it right so like they're not for
just optimizing for the click ability is

2120
00:45:55,660 --> 00:45:55,670
just optimizing for the click ability is
 

2121
00:45:55,670 --> 00:45:59,420
just optimizing for the click ability is
I hope so my thought is how do you think

2122
00:45:59,420 --> 00:45:59,430
I hope so my thought is how do you think
 

2123
00:45:59,430 --> 00:46:01,160
I hope so my thought is how do you think
of it and this would affect your own

2124
00:46:01,160 --> 00:46:01,170
of it and this would affect your own
 

2125
00:46:01,170 --> 00:46:03,410
of it and this would affect your own
content like how deep you go how

2126
00:46:03,410 --> 00:46:03,420
content like how deep you go how
 

2127
00:46:03,420 --> 00:46:05,750
content like how deep you go how
profound you explore the directions and

2128
00:46:05,750 --> 00:46:05,760
profound you explore the directions and
 

2129
00:46:05,760 --> 00:46:09,050
profound you explore the directions and
so on I I've been really lucky in that I

2130
00:46:09,050 --> 00:46:09,060
so on I I've been really lucky in that I
 

2131
00:46:09,060 --> 00:46:12,470
so on I I've been really lucky in that I
don't worry too much about the algorithm

2132
00:46:12,470 --> 00:46:12,480
don't worry too much about the algorithm
 

2133
00:46:12,480 --> 00:46:14,120
don't worry too much about the algorithm
