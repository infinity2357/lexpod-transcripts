of any organism to see any aspect of
 

121
00:02:07,680 --> 00:02:10,150
of any organism to see any aspect of
objective reality so in that sense

122
00:02:10,150 --> 00:02:10,160
objective reality so in that sense
 

123
00:02:10,160 --> 00:02:13,510
objective reality so in that sense
uh what we're seeing is

124
00:02:13,510 --> 00:02:13,520
uh what we're seeing is
 

125
00:02:13,520 --> 00:02:14,710
uh what we're seeing is
what we need

126
00:02:14,710 --> 00:02:14,720
what we need
 

127
00:02:14,720 --> 00:02:16,390
what we need
to see

128
00:02:16,390 --> 00:02:16,400
to see
 

129
00:02:16,400 --> 00:02:18,710
to see
to stay alive long enough to reproduce

130
00:02:18,710 --> 00:02:18,720
to stay alive long enough to reproduce
 

131
00:02:18,720 --> 00:02:20,150
to stay alive long enough to reproduce
so in other words we're seeing what we

132
00:02:20,150 --> 00:02:20,160
so in other words we're seeing what we
 

133
00:02:20,160 --> 00:02:22,550
so in other words we're seeing what we
need to guide adaptive behavior full

134
00:02:22,550 --> 00:02:22,560
need to guide adaptive behavior full
 

135
00:02:22,560 --> 00:02:23,430

stop

stop
 

137
00:02:23,440 --> 00:02:24,229
stop
so

138
00:02:24,229 --> 00:02:24,239
so
 

139
00:02:24,239 --> 00:02:26,710
so
the evolutionary process the process

140
00:02:26,710 --> 00:02:26,720
the evolutionary process the process
 

141
00:02:26,720 --> 00:02:29,350
the evolutionary process the process
that took us from the origin of life on

142
00:02:29,350 --> 00:02:29,360
that took us from the origin of life on
 

143
00:02:29,360 --> 00:02:33,190
that took us from the origin of life on
earth to the humans that we are today

00:02:33,200 --> 00:02:36,630
earth to the humans that we are today
that process does not maximize

146
00:02:36,630 --> 00:02:36,640
that process does not maximize
 

147
00:02:36,640 --> 00:02:38,710
that process does not maximize
for truth to maximizes for fitness as

00:02:38,710 --> 00:02:38,720
for truth to maximizes for fitness as
 

149
00:02:38,720 --> 00:02:41,190
for truth to maximizes for fitness as
you say fitness beats truth

150
00:02:41,190 --> 00:02:41,200
you say fitness beats truth
 

151
00:02:41,200 --> 00:02:43,670
you say fitness beats truth
and fitness does not have to be

152
00:02:43,670 --> 00:02:43,680
and fitness does not have to be
 

153
00:02:43,680 --> 00:02:46,550
and fitness does not have to be
connected to truth is the claim

154
00:02:46,550 --> 00:02:46,560
connected to truth is the claim
 

155
00:02:46,560 --> 00:02:48,869
connected to truth is the claim
and that's where you have an approach

156
00:02:48,869 --> 00:02:48,879
and that's where you have an approach
 

157
00:02:48,879 --> 00:02:52,710
and that's where you have an approach
towards zero of probability that we

158
00:02:52,710 --> 00:02:52,720
towards zero of probability that we
 

159
00:02:52,720 --> 00:02:54,229

00:05:41,199 --> 00:05:42,790
order on it
so it's got end states and they're

342
00:05:42,790 --> 00:05:42,800
so it's got end states and they're
 

343
00:05:42,800 --> 00:05:45,909
so it's got end states and they're
totally ordered and then you can have

344
00:05:45,909 --> 00:05:45,919
totally ordered and then you can have
 

345
00:05:45,919 --> 00:05:48,550
totally ordered and then you can have
a set of maps from that world into a set

346
00:05:48,550 --> 00:05:48,560
a set of maps from that world into a set
 

347
00:05:48,560 --> 00:05:50,390
a set of maps from that world into a set
of payoffs say from zero to a thousand

348
00:05:50,390 --> 00:05:50,400
of payoffs say from zero to a thousand
 

349
00:05:50,400 --> 00:05:52,550
of payoffs say from zero to a thousand
or whatever you want your payoffs to be

350
00:05:52,550 --> 00:05:52,560
or whatever you want your payoffs to be
 

351
00:05:52,560 --> 00:05:54,629
or whatever you want your payoffs to be
and you can just literally count all the

352
00:05:54,629 --> 00:05:54,639
and you can just literally count all the
 

353
00:05:54,639 --> 00:05:56,070
and you can just literally count all the
payoff functions

354
00:05:56,070 --> 00:05:56,080
payoff functions
 

355
00:05:56,080 --> 00:05:57,510
payoff functions
and just do the combinatorics and count

356
00:05:57,510 --> 00:05:57,520
and just do the combinatorics and count
 

357
00:05:57,520 --> 00:05:59,749
and just do the combinatorics and count
them then you can ask a precise question

358
00:05:59,749 --> 00:05:59,759
them then you can ask a precise question
 

359
00:05:59,759 --> 00:06:02,150
them then you can ask a precise question
how many of those payoff functions

360
00:06:02,150 --> 00:06:02,160
how many of those payoff functions
 

361
00:06:02,160 --> 00:06:04,309
how many of those payoff functions
preserve the total order if that's what

362
00:06:04,309 --> 00:06:04,319
preserve the total order if that's what
 

363
00:06:04,319 --> 00:06:05,670
preserve the total order if that's what
you live or how many preserve the

364
00:06:05,670 --> 00:06:05,680
you live or how many preserve the
 

365
00:06:05,680 --> 00:06:07,189
you live or how many preserve the
topology

366
00:06:07,189 --> 00:06:07,199
topology
 

367
00:06:07,199 --> 00:06:09,270
topology
and you just count them and divide so so

368
00:06:09,270 --> 00:06:09,280
and you just count them and divide so so
 

369
00:06:09,280 --> 00:06:11,749
and you just count them and divide so so
the number that are homomorphisms

370
00:06:11,749 --> 00:06:11,759
the number that are homomorphisms
 

371
00:06:11,759 --> 00:06:13,510
the number that are homomorphisms
versus the total number and then take

372
00:06:13,510 --> 00:06:13,520
versus the total number and then take
 

373
00:06:13,520 --> 00:06:15,270
versus the total number and then take
the limit as the number

374
00:06:15,270 --> 00:06:15,280
the limit as the number
 

375
00:06:15,280 --> 00:06:17,350
the limit as the number
of states in the world and the number of

376
00:06:17,350 --> 00:06:17,360
of states in the world and the number of
 

377
00:06:17,360 --> 00:06:20,070
of states in the world and the number of
payoff values goes very large and when

378
00:06:20,070 --> 00:06:20,080
payoff values goes very large and when
 

379
00:06:20,080 --> 00:06:21,909

so none of this is real

then there's also ideas of chemistry

446
00:07:33,510 --> 00:07:33,520
then there's also ideas of chemistry

00:07:44,950 --> 00:07:44,960
so all of that
 

457
00:07:44,960 --> 00:07:46,550
so all of that
is not real

458
00:07:46,550 --> 00:07:46,560
is not real

00:07:46,560 --> 00:07:49,510

it's a real experience and it's a real

it's a real experience and it's a real

00:07:53,680 --> 00:07:56,230

467
00:07:56,240 --> 00:07:58,469

we want to think perceptions are real so

we want to think perceptions are real so
 

469
00:07:58,479 --> 00:07:59,990
we want to think perceptions are real so
so their perceptions are real as

so their perceptions are real as

00:08:00,000 --> 00:08:02,230
so their perceptions are real as

but we've assumed that there's uh a
 

477
00:08:05,840 --> 00:08:07,670
but we've assumed that there's uh a

and see
 

483
00:08:10,720 --> 00:08:13,189
and see
the moon then there is something that

484
00:08:13,189 --> 00:08:13,199
the moon then there is something that
 

485
00:08:13,199 --> 00:08:17,110
the moon then there is something that

487
00:08:17,120 --> 00:08:20,710
exists in space and time that uh matches
um what i perceive and

488
00:08:20,710 --> 00:08:20,720
um what i perceive and
 

489
00:08:20,720 --> 00:08:23,749
um what i perceive and
all i'm saying is that if you

490
00:08:23,749 --> 00:08:23,759
all i'm saying is that if you
 

491
00:08:23,759 --> 00:08:25,589
all i'm saying is that if you
take evolution by natural selection

492
00:08:25,589 --> 00:08:25,599
take evolution by natural selection
 

493
00:08:25,599 --> 00:08:27,110
take evolution by natural selection

then

496
00:08:27,909 --> 00:08:27,919
then
 

497
00:08:27,919 --> 00:08:30,950
then
that is precluded that our perceptions

00:08:30,950 --> 00:08:30,960
that is precluded that our perceptions

00:08:38,399 --> 00:08:40,550
the truth in fact the way i think about
it is they're there to hide the truth

508
00:08:40,550 --> 00:08:40,560
it is they're there to hide the truth
 

509
00:08:40,560 --> 00:08:42,389
it is they're there to hide the truth
because the truth is too complicated

510
00:08:42,389 --> 00:08:42,399
because the truth is too complicated
 

511
00:08:42,399 --> 00:08:44,070
because the truth is too complicated
it's just like if you're trying to you

512
00:08:44,070 --> 00:08:44,080
it's just like if you're trying to you
 

513
00:08:44,080 --> 00:08:44,710
it's just like if you're trying to you
know

514
00:08:44,710 --> 00:08:44,720
know
 

515
00:08:44,720 --> 00:08:46,949
know
use your laptop to write an email

516
00:08:46,949 --> 00:08:46,959
use your laptop to write an email
 

517
00:08:46,959 --> 00:08:48,710
use your laptop to write an email
right what you're doing is toggling

518
00:08:48,710 --> 00:08:48,720
right what you're doing is toggling
 

519
00:08:48,720 --> 00:08:50,710
right what you're doing is toggling
voltages in the computer but good luck

520
00:08:50,710 --> 00:08:50,720
voltages in the computer but good luck
 

521
00:08:50,720 --> 00:08:52,630
voltages in the computer but good luck
trying to do it that way that's

522
00:08:52,630 --> 00:08:52,640
trying to do it that way that's
 

523
00:08:52,640 --> 00:08:54,230
trying to do it that way that's
the reason why we have a user interface

524
00:08:54,230 --> 00:08:54,240
the reason why we have a user interface
 

525
00:08:54,240 --> 00:08:55,350
the reason why we have a user interface
is because we don't want to know that

526
00:08:55,350 --> 00:08:55,360
is because we don't want to know that
 

527
00:08:55,360 --> 00:08:57,190
is because we don't want to know that
quote unquote truth the diodes and

00:08:58,790 --> 00:08:58,800
resistors all that that terrible
 

531
00:08:58,800 --> 00:09:00,550
resistors all that that terrible
hardware if you had to know all that

532
00:09:00,550 --> 00:09:00,560
hardware if you had to know all that
 

533
00:09:00,560 --> 00:09:01,509
hardware if you had to know all that
truth

534
00:09:01,509 --> 00:09:01,519

535
00:09:01,519 --> 00:09:02,790

it would your friends wouldn't hear from

536
00:09:02,790 --> 00:09:02,800
it would your friends wouldn't hear from
 

537
00:09:02,800 --> 00:09:03,910
it would your friends wouldn't hear from
you

538
00:09:03,910 --> 00:09:03,920
you
 

539
00:09:03,920 --> 00:09:04,870
you
so you

540
00:09:04,870 --> 00:09:04,880
so you
 

541
00:09:04,880 --> 00:09:07,590
so you
so what evolution gave us was

542
00:09:07,590 --> 00:09:07,600
so what evolution gave us was
 

543
00:09:07,600 --> 00:09:10,070
so what evolution gave us was
perceptions that guide adaptive behavior

544
00:09:10,070 --> 00:09:10,080
perceptions that guide adaptive behavior
 

545
00:09:10,080 --> 00:09:11,910
perceptions that guide adaptive behavior
and part of that process it turns out

546
00:09:11,910 --> 00:09:11,920
and part of that process it turns out
 

547
00:09:11,920 --> 00:09:15,190
and part of that process it turns out
means hiding the truth and giving you

548
00:09:15,190 --> 00:09:15,200
means hiding the truth and giving you
 

549
00:09:15,200 --> 00:09:16,550
means hiding the truth and giving you
eye candy

550
00:09:16,550 --> 00:09:16,560
eye candy
 

551
00:09:16,560 --> 00:09:17,430
eye candy
so

552
00:09:17,430 --> 00:09:17,440
so
 

553
00:09:17,440 --> 00:09:19,670
so
what's the difference between hiding the

554
00:09:19,670 --> 00:09:19,680
what's the difference between hiding the
 

555
00:09:19,680 --> 00:09:20,630
what's the difference between hiding the
truth

556
00:09:20,630 --> 00:09:20,640

evolution doesn't tell us the backstory

evolution doesn't tell us the backstory
right so the theory of evolution is not

right so the theory of evolution is not

00:10:19,040 --> 00:10:21,829
right so the theory of evolution is not
going to be adequate to tell you

right now we can we can try to look at
 

635
00:10:41,680 --> 00:10:43,910
right now we can we can try to look at
certain aspects of the interface but

636

certain aspects of the interface but
 

637
00:10:43,920 --> 00:10:45,269
certain aspects of the interface but
already we're going to look at that and

638

already we're going to look at that and
 

639
00:10:45,279 --> 00:10:47,350
already we're going to look at that and
go real okay before i would look at

and now i'm realizing it could be like
 

649

there's just no way so what's

00:11:07,279 --> 00:11:08,630
there's just no way so what's
interesting about this is that our

interesting about this is that our

are
precise enough and rigorous enough to

precise enough and rigorous enough to
tell us certain limits

tell us certain limits
 

671
00:11:16,959 --> 00:11:18,710
tell us certain limits
but and even the limits of the theories

00:11:19,829 --> 00:11:19,839
themselves
 

675
00:11:19,839 --> 00:11:21,030
themselves
but they're not

676
00:11:21,030 --> 00:11:21,040
but they're not
 

677
00:11:21,040 --> 00:11:23,030
but they're not
going to tell us what the next move is

678
00:11:23,030 --> 00:11:23,040
going to tell us what the next move is
 

679
00:11:23,040 --> 00:11:24,630
going to tell us what the next move is
and that's where scientific creativity

680
00:11:24,630 --> 00:11:24,640
and that's where scientific creativity
 

681
00:11:24,640 --> 00:11:25,750
and that's where scientific creativity
comes in

682
00:11:25,750 --> 00:11:25,760
comes in
 

683
00:11:25,760 --> 00:11:27,750
comes in
so the stuff that i'm saying here for

684
00:11:27,750 --> 00:11:27,760
so the stuff that i'm saying here for
 

685
00:11:27,760 --> 00:11:30,790
so the stuff that i'm saying here for
example um is not alien to physicists

686
00:11:30,790 --> 00:11:30,800
example um is not alien to physicists
 

687
00:11:30,800 --> 00:11:32,550
example um is not alien to physicists
the physicists are saying

688
00:11:32,550 --> 00:11:32,560
the physicists are saying
 

689
00:11:32,560 --> 00:11:34,150
the physicists are saying
precisely the same thing that space time

690
00:11:34,150 --> 00:11:34,160
precisely the same thing that space time
 

691
00:11:34,160 --> 00:11:36,150
precisely the same thing that space time
is doomed we've assumed that space time

692
00:11:36,150 --> 00:11:36,160
is doomed we've assumed that space time
 

693
00:11:36,160 --> 00:11:38,150
is doomed we've assumed that space time
is fundamental we've assumed that for

694
00:11:38,150 --> 00:11:38,160
is fundamental we've assumed that for
 

695
00:11:38,160 --> 00:11:39,829
is fundamental we've assumed that for
for several centuries and it's been very

696
00:11:39,829 --> 00:11:39,839
for several centuries and it's been very
 

697
00:11:39,839 --> 00:11:41,430
for several centuries and it's been very
useful so all the things that you were

698
00:11:41,430 --> 00:11:41,440
useful so all the things that you were
 

699
00:11:41,440 --> 00:11:42,870
useful so all the things that you were
mentioning the particles and all the

700
00:11:42,870 --> 00:11:42,880
mentioning the particles and all the
 

701
00:11:42,880 --> 00:11:44,150
mentioning the particles and all the
work that's been done that's all been

702
00:11:44,150 --> 00:11:44,160
work that's been done that's all been
 

703
00:11:44,160 --> 00:11:46,150
work that's been done that's all been
done in space time but now physicists

704
00:11:46,150 --> 00:11:46,160
done in space time but now physicists
 

705
00:11:46,160 --> 00:11:47,590
done in space time but now physicists
are saying space time is doomed there's

706
00:11:47,590 --> 00:11:47,600
are saying space time is doomed there's
 

707
00:11:47,600 --> 00:11:48,870
are saying space time is doomed there's
no such thing

708
00:11:48,870 --> 00:11:48,880
no such thing
 

709
00:11:48,880 --> 00:11:51,590
no such thing
as space time fundamentally

710
00:11:51,590 --> 00:11:51,600
as space time fundamentally
 

711
00:11:51,600 --> 00:11:53,910
as space time fundamentally
in the laws of physics

712
00:11:53,910 --> 00:11:53,920
in the laws of physics
 

713
00:11:53,920 --> 00:11:54,790
in the laws of physics
and

714
00:11:54,790 --> 00:11:54,800
and
 

715
00:11:54,800 --> 00:11:57,590
and
that comes actually out of

716
00:11:57,590 --> 00:11:57,600
that comes actually out of
 

717
00:11:57,600 --> 00:11:59,509
that comes actually out of
gravity together with quantum field

718
00:11:59,509 --> 00:11:59,519
gravity together with quantum field
 

719
00:11:59,519 --> 00:12:00,949
gravity together with quantum field
theory it just comes right out of it

720
00:12:00,949 --> 00:12:00,959
theory it just comes right out of it
 

721
00:12:00,959 --> 00:12:03,990
theory it just comes right out of it
it's it's it's a theorem of of those two

722
00:12:03,990 --> 00:12:04,000
it's it's it's a theorem of of those two
 

723
00:12:04,000 --> 00:12:05,670
it's it's it's a theorem of of those two
theories put together

724
00:12:05,670 --> 00:12:05,680
theories put together
 

725
00:12:05,680 --> 00:12:07,910
theories put together
but it doesn't tell you what's behind it

726
00:12:07,910 --> 00:12:07,920
but it doesn't tell you what's behind it
 

727
00:12:07,920 --> 00:12:10,230
but it doesn't tell you what's behind it
so the physicists are know that their

728
00:12:10,230 --> 00:12:10,240
so the physicists are know that their
 

729
00:12:10,240 --> 00:12:11,670
so the physicists are know that their
their best theories

730
00:12:11,670 --> 00:12:11,680
their best theories

00:12:22,399 --> 00:12:23,750
they're just irreducible representations
of the symmetries of space time that's

of the symmetries of space time that's
 

745
00:12:23,760 --> 00:12:26,310
of the symmetries of space time that's
what they are so we have so space time

00:12:26,310 --> 00:12:26,320
what they are so we have so space time
 

747
00:12:26,320 --> 00:12:27,750
what they are so we have so space time
so we put the two together we put

748
00:12:27,750 --> 00:12:27,760
so we put the two together we put
 

749
00:12:27,760 --> 00:12:29,030
so we put the two together we put
together what the physicists are

750
00:12:29,030 --> 00:12:29,040
together what the physicists are
 

751
00:12:29,040 --> 00:12:30,790
together what the physicists are
discovering and we can talk about how

752
00:12:30,790 --> 00:12:30,800
discovering and we can talk about how
 

753
00:12:30,800 --> 00:12:33,190
discovering and we can talk about how
they do that and then we the new

754
00:12:33,190 --> 00:12:33,200
they do that and then we the new
 

755
00:12:33,200 --> 00:12:34,629
they do that and then we the new
discoveries from evolution of natural

756
00:12:34,629 --> 00:12:34,639
discoveries from evolution of natural
 

757
00:12:34,639 --> 00:12:36,230

really in the last 20 years
 

761
00:12:38,639 --> 00:12:41,350
really in the last 20 years
and what both are saying is um spacetime

762
00:12:41,350 --> 00:12:41,360
and what both are saying is um spacetime
 

763
00:12:41,360 --> 00:12:43,269
and what both are saying is um spacetime

we are they're saying that and i can say

00:13:47,199 --> 00:13:48,550
we are they're saying that and i can say
exactly why

exactly why
 

829
00:13:48,560 --> 00:13:50,069
exactly why
they think it's doomed but what they're

830
00:13:50,069 --> 00:13:50,079
they think it's doomed but what they're
 

831
00:13:50,079 --> 00:13:51,670
they think it's doomed but what they're
saying is that you know because your

both space and time they're union into

both space and time they're union into

00:14:01,199 --> 00:14:02,470
that's doomed
and

and
 

845
00:14:02,480 --> 00:14:05,110
and
they're they're basically saying that

00:14:05,110 --> 00:14:05,120
they're they're basically saying that
 

847
00:14:05,120 --> 00:14:07,670
they're they're basically saying that
even quantum theory this is with neymar

it's missing deep symmetry something

940
00:15:37,110 --> 00:15:37,120
it's missing deep symmetry something
 

941
00:15:37,120 --> 00:15:39,030
it's missing deep symmetry something
called a dual conformal symmetry which

called a dual conformal symmetry which

called a dual conformal symmetry which
turns out to be true of the scattering

944
00:15:40,310 --> 00:15:40,320
turns out to be true of the scattering

00:15:40,320 --> 00:15:42,550
turns out to be true of the scattering

data but you can't see it in space-time
 

947
00:15:42,560 --> 00:15:44,310
data but you can't see it in space-time
and it's making the comp the

948
00:15:44,310 --> 00:15:44,320
and it's making the comp the
 

949
00:15:44,320 --> 00:15:46,230
and it's making the comp the
computations way too complicated because

950
00:15:46,230 --> 00:15:46,240
computations way too complicated because
 

951
00:15:46,240 --> 00:15:47,749
computations way too complicated because
you're trying to compute all the loops

952
00:15:47,749 --> 00:15:47,759
you're trying to compute all the loops
 

953
00:15:47,759 --> 00:15:49,430
you're trying to compute all the loops
and feynman diagrams and all the

954
00:15:49,430 --> 00:15:49,440
and feynman diagrams and all the
 

955
00:15:49,440 --> 00:15:51,430
and feynman diagrams and all the
finement integrals so see the feynman

956
00:15:51,430 --> 00:15:51,440
finement integrals so see the feynman
 

957
00:15:51,440 --> 00:15:53,030
finement integrals so see the feynman
approach to the scattering amplitudes is

958
00:15:53,030 --> 00:15:53,040
approach to the scattering amplitudes is
 

959
00:15:53,040 --> 00:15:54,870
approach to the scattering amplitudes is
trying to enforce two critical

960
00:15:54,870 --> 00:15:54,880
trying to enforce two critical
 

961
00:15:54,880 --> 00:15:57,030
trying to enforce two critical
properties of space time locality and

962
00:15:57,030 --> 00:15:57,040
properties of space time locality and
 

963
00:15:57,040 --> 00:15:58,470
properties of space time locality and
unitarity

964
00:15:58,470 --> 00:15:58,480
unitarity
 

965
00:15:58,480 --> 00:16:00,870
unitarity
and so by when you enforce those you get

966
00:16:00,870 --> 00:16:00,880
and so by when you enforce those you get
 

967
00:16:00,880 --> 00:16:03,430
and so by when you enforce those you get
all these loops and multiple you know

968
00:16:03,430 --> 00:16:03,440
all these loops and multiple you know
 

969
00:16:03,440 --> 00:16:04,790
all these loops and multiple you know
different levels of loops and for each

970
00:16:04,790 --> 00:16:04,800
different levels of loops and for each
 

971
00:16:04,800 --> 00:16:06,310
different levels of loops and for each
of those you have to add new terms to

972
00:16:06,310 --> 00:16:06,320
of those you have to add new terms to
 

973
00:16:06,320 --> 00:16:08,389
of those you have to add new terms to
your computation but when you

974
00:16:08,389 --> 00:16:08,399
your computation but when you
 

975
00:16:08,399 --> 00:16:11,030
your computation but when you
do it outside of space time

976
00:16:11,030 --> 00:16:11,040
do it outside of space time
 

977
00:16:11,040 --> 00:16:13,509
do it outside of space time
you don't have the notion of unitarity

978
00:16:13,509 --> 00:16:13,519
you don't have the notion of unitarity
 

979
00:16:13,519 --> 00:16:15,509
you don't have the notion of unitarity
you don't have the notion of locality

980
00:16:15,509 --> 00:16:15,519
you don't have the notion of locality
 

981
00:16:15,519 --> 00:16:17,430
you don't have the notion of locality
you have something deeper and is

982
00:16:17,430 --> 00:16:17,440
you have something deeper and is
 

983
00:16:17,440 --> 00:16:18,870
you have something deeper and is
capturing some symmetries that are

984
00:16:18,870 --> 00:16:18,880
capturing some symmetries that are
 

985
00:16:18,880 --> 00:16:20,710
capturing some symmetries that are
actually true of the data

986
00:16:20,710 --> 00:16:20,720
actually true of the data
 

987
00:16:20,720 --> 00:16:22,310
actually true of the data
and but then when you look at the

988
00:16:22,310 --> 00:16:22,320
and but then when you look at the
 

989
00:16:22,320 --> 00:16:23,910
and but then when you look at the
geometry of the facets of these

990
00:16:23,910 --> 00:16:23,920
geometry of the facets of these
 

991
00:16:23,920 --> 00:16:25,269
geometry of the facets of these
polytopes

992
00:16:25,269 --> 00:16:25,279
polytopes
 

993
00:16:25,279 --> 00:16:28,629
polytopes
then certain of them will code for

994
00:16:28,629 --> 00:16:28,639
then certain of them will code for
 

995
00:16:28,639 --> 00:16:31,189
then certain of them will code for
unitarity and locality so it actually

996
00:16:31,189 --> 00:16:31,199
unitarity and locality so it actually
 

997
00:16:31,199 --> 00:16:32,629
unitarity and locality so it actually
comes out of the structure of these deep

998
00:16:32,629 --> 00:16:32,639
comes out of the structure of these deep
 

999
00:16:32,639 --> 00:16:34,790
comes out of the structure of these deep
polytubes so what we're finding is

1000
00:16:34,790 --> 00:16:34,800
polytubes so what we're finding is
 

1001
00:16:34,800 --> 00:16:37,430
polytubes so what we're finding is
there's this whole new world now

1002
00:16:37,430 --> 00:16:37,440
there's this whole new world now
 

1003
00:16:37,440 --> 00:16:39,509
there's this whole new world now
beyond space-time

1004
00:16:39,509 --> 00:16:39,519
beyond space-time
 

1005
00:16:39,519 --> 00:16:42,069
beyond space-time
that is making explicit symmetries that

1006
00:16:42,069 --> 00:16:42,079
that is making explicit symmetries that
 

1007
00:16:42,079 --> 00:16:43,749
that is making explicit symmetries that
are true of the data that cannot be seen

1008
00:16:43,749 --> 00:16:43,759
are true of the data that cannot be seen
 

1009
00:16:43,759 --> 00:16:44,949
are true of the data that cannot be seen
in space-time

1010
00:16:44,949 --> 00:16:44,959
in space-time
 

1011
00:16:44,959 --> 00:16:46,550
in space-time
and that is turning the computations

1012
00:16:46,550 --> 00:16:46,560
and that is turning the computations
 

1013
00:16:46,560 --> 00:16:49,030
and that is turning the computations
from billions of terms to one or two or

1014
00:16:49,030 --> 00:16:49,040
from billions of terms to one or two or
 

1015
00:16:49,040 --> 00:16:51,590
from billions of terms to one or two or
a handful of terms so we're getting

1016
00:16:51,590 --> 00:16:51,600
a handful of terms so we're getting
 

1017
00:16:51,600 --> 00:16:53,670
a handful of terms so we're getting
insights into symmetries and we're and

1018
00:16:53,670 --> 00:16:53,680
insights into symmetries and we're and
 

1019
00:16:53,680 --> 00:16:54,949
insights into symmetries and we're and
all of a sudden the math is becoming

1020
00:16:54,949 --> 00:16:54,959
all of a sudden the math is becoming
 

1021
00:16:54,959 --> 00:16:56,389
all of a sudden the math is becoming
simple because we're not doing something

1022
00:16:56,389 --> 00:16:56,399
simple because we're not doing something
 

1023
00:16:56,399 --> 00:16:57,670
simple because we're not doing something
silly we're not adding up all these

1024
00:16:57,670 --> 00:16:57,680
silly we're not adding up all these
 

1025
00:16:57,680 --> 00:16:59,269
silly we're not adding up all these
loops in space time we're doing

00:16:59,269 --> 00:16:59,279
loops in space time we're doing
 

1027
00:16:59,279 --> 00:17:01,269

what what flashlight are we going to use
 

1047
00:17:17,199 --> 00:17:19,590
what what flashlight are we going to use
to look into the dark beyond space time

to look into the dark beyond space time

to look into the dark beyond space time
because einstein's theory and quantum

all they can do is tell us that when you

all they can do is tell us that when you

space time doesn't even make sense it

space time doesn't even make sense it

space time doesn't even make sense it
just has no operational definition

just has no operational definition
 

1067

just has no operational definition
so but it doesn't tell you what's beyond

1068
00:17:38,789 --> 00:17:38,799
so but it doesn't tell you what's beyond
 

1069
00:17:38,799 --> 00:17:40,630
so but it doesn't tell you what's beyond
and so they're they're just looking for

and so they're they're just looking for
 

1071
00:17:40,640 --> 00:17:42,789
and so they're they're just looking for
deep structures like guessing

it's really fun so these really

what deeper structure could give us the

00:17:56,559 --> 00:17:58,150
what deeper structure could give us the

but without certain commitments that we
 

1093
00:18:00,080 --> 00:18:02,150
but without certain commitments that we
have to make in space time like locality

00:18:02,150 --> 00:18:02,160
have to make in space time like locality
 

1095
00:18:02,160 --> 00:18:04,549
have to make in space time like locality
and so they make these brilliant guesses

1096
00:18:04,549 --> 00:18:04,559
and so they make these brilliant guesses
 

1097
00:18:04,559 --> 00:18:05,510
and so they make these brilliant guesses
and of course most of the time you're

1098
00:18:05,510 --> 00:18:05,520
and of course most of the time you're
 

1099
00:18:05,520 --> 00:18:07,430
and of course most of the time you're
going to be wrong but once you get one

1100
00:18:07,430 --> 00:18:07,440
going to be wrong but once you get one
 

1101
00:18:07,440 --> 00:18:09,750
going to be wrong but once you get one
or two that start to pay off and then

1102
00:18:09,750 --> 00:18:09,760
or two that start to pay off and then
 

1103
00:18:09,760 --> 00:18:11,990
or two that start to pay off and then
you get some lucky breaks so they got a

00:18:11,990 --> 00:18:12,000
you get some lucky breaks so they got a
 

1105
00:18:12,000 --> 00:18:14,950
you get some lucky breaks so they got a

and taylor
 

1111
00:18:18,640 --> 00:18:21,190
and taylor
took the scattering amplitude for two

1112
00:18:21,190 --> 00:18:21,200
took the scattering amplitude for two
 

1113
00:18:21,200 --> 00:18:23,590
took the scattering amplitude for two

that's sort of something that happens so

1122
00:18:31,669 --> 00:18:31,679
that's sort of something that happens so
 

1123
00:18:31,679 --> 00:18:33,590
that's sort of something that happens so
often you need to be able to find it and

often you need to be able to find it and
 

1125
00:18:33,600 --> 00:18:34,710
often you need to be able to find it and
get rid of those because you already

get rid of those because you already
know about that and you need to so you

know about that and you need to so you
 

1129
00:18:36,320 --> 00:18:37,750
know about that and you need to so you
needed to compute them it was billions

1130
00:18:37,750 --> 00:18:37,760
needed to compute them it was billions
 

1131
00:18:37,760 --> 00:18:38,789
needed to compute them it was billions

of terms
 

1133
00:18:38,799 --> 00:18:40,549

begged the experimentalists begged the

so park and taylor took the billions of

1146
00:18:52,710 --> 00:18:52,720
so park and taylor took the billions of
 

1147
00:18:52,720 --> 00:18:55,190
so park and taylor took the billions of
terms hundreds of pages and

1148
00:18:55,190 --> 00:18:55,200
terms hundreds of pages and
 

1149
00:18:55,200 --> 00:18:57,110
terms hundreds of pages and
miraculous miraculously turned it into

00:18:57,110 --> 00:18:57,120
miraculous miraculously turned it into
 

1151
00:18:57,120 --> 00:18:57,990
miraculous miraculously turned it into
nine

1152
00:18:57,990 --> 00:18:58,000
nine
 

1153
00:18:58,000 --> 00:18:59,990
nine
and then a little bit later they guessed

1154
00:18:59,990 --> 00:19:00,000
and then a little bit later they guessed
 

1155
00:19:00,000 --> 00:19:01,590
and then a little bit later they guessed
one term expression that turned out to

1156
00:19:01,590 --> 00:19:01,600
one term expression that turned out to
 

1157
00:19:01,600 --> 00:19:03,350
one term expression that turned out to

going to do beyond space-time it needs
 

1251
00:20:35,760 --> 00:20:38,149
going to do beyond space-time it needs

to project into space-time and whatever
 

1253
00:20:38,159 --> 00:20:40,710
to project into space-time and whatever
this deeper theory is it may not itself

this deeper theory is it may not itself
 

1255
00:20:40,720 --> 00:20:42,870
this deeper theory is it may not itself
have evolution by natural selection this

1256
00:20:42,870 --> 00:20:42,880
have evolution by natural selection this
 

1257
00:20:42,880 --> 00:20:44,470
have evolution by natural selection this
may not be part of this deeper realm but

1258
00:20:44,470 --> 00:20:44,480
may not be part of this deeper realm but
 

1259
00:20:44,480 --> 00:20:46,470
may not be part of this deeper realm but
when we take the whatever that thing is

1260
00:20:46,470 --> 00:20:46,480
when we take the whatever that thing is
 

1261
00:20:46,480 --> 00:20:48,310
when we take the whatever that thing is
beyond space-time and projected into

00:20:48,310 --> 00:20:48,320
beyond space-time and projected into
 

1263
00:20:48,320 --> 00:20:50,310
beyond space-time and projected into
space-time it has to look like evolution

1264
00:20:50,310 --> 00:20:50,320
space-time it has to look like evolution
 

1265
00:20:50,320 --> 00:20:52,950
space-time it has to look like evolution
by natural selection or it's wrong

1266
00:20:52,950 --> 00:20:52,960
by natural selection or it's wrong
 

1267
00:20:52,960 --> 00:20:55,029
by natural selection or it's wrong
so so that's

1268
00:20:55,029 --> 00:20:55,039
so so that's
 

1269
00:20:55,039 --> 00:20:56,950
so so that's
so that's a strong constraint on this

1270
00:20:56,950 --> 00:20:56,960
so that's a strong constraint on this
 

1271
00:20:56,960 --> 00:20:59,350
so that's a strong constraint on this
work so even the evolution

1272
00:20:59,350 --> 00:20:59,360
work so even the evolution
 

1273
00:20:59,360 --> 00:21:03,029
work so even the evolution
by natural selection and uh

1274
00:21:03,029 --> 00:21:03,039
by natural selection and uh

that doesn't look anything like
like you mentioned i mean it's

like you mentioned i mean it's

00:21:12,799 --> 00:21:14,390
like you mentioned i mean it's
interesting to think that evolution

00:21:52,320 --> 00:21:55,029
as a mathematical extension of our

1324
00:21:55,029 --> 00:21:55,039
perceptions and then einstein then took
 

1325
00:21:55,039 --> 00:21:56,789
perceptions and then einstein then took
that and extended it even further so the

1326
00:21:56,789 --> 00:21:56,799
that and extended it even further so the
 

1327
00:21:56,799 --> 00:21:58,549
that and extended it even further so the
relationship between what evolution is

relationship between what evolution is
 

1329
00:21:58,559 --> 00:21:59,750

00:21:59,750 --> 00:21:59,760
telling us what the physicists are
 

1331
00:21:59,760 --> 00:22:02,070
telling us what the physicists are
telling us is that in some sense the

00:22:02,080 --> 00:22:04,870
telling us is that in some sense the

1337
00:22:07,039 --> 00:22:08,390

are formulated

1338
00:22:08,390 --> 00:22:08,400
are formulated
 

1339
00:22:08,400 --> 00:22:10,070
are formulated
as sort of

1340
00:22:10,070 --> 00:22:10,080
as sort of
 

1341
00:22:10,080 --> 00:22:11,990
as sort of
rigorous extensions of our perceptual

1342
00:22:11,990 --> 00:22:12,000
rigorous extensions of our perceptual
 

1343
00:22:12,000 --> 00:22:13,430

space
 

1345
00:22:13,440 --> 00:22:16,149
space
um making it mathematically rigorous and

1346
00:22:16,149 --> 00:22:16,159
um making it mathematically rigorous and
 

1347
00:22:16,159 --> 00:22:17,990
um making it mathematically rigorous and
laying out the symmetries that that they

1348
00:22:17,990 --> 00:22:18,000
laying out the symmetries that that they
 

1349
00:22:18,000 --> 00:22:19,830
laying out the symmetries that that they
find there so that's sort of the

1350
00:22:19,830 --> 00:22:19,840
find there so that's sort of the
 

1351
00:22:19,840 --> 00:22:21,190
find there so that's sort of the
relationship between them so it's the

1352
00:22:21,190 --> 00:22:21,200
relationship between them so it's the
 

1353
00:22:21,200 --> 00:22:23,029
relationship between them so it's the
perceptual space time that evolution is

1354
00:22:23,029 --> 00:22:23,039
perceptual space time that evolution is
 

1355
00:22:23,039 --> 00:22:23,990
perceptual space time that evolution is
telling us

1356
00:22:23,990 --> 00:22:24,000
telling us
 

1357
00:22:24,000 --> 00:22:27,590
telling us
is just a user interface effectively

1358
00:22:27,590 --> 00:22:27,600
is just a user interface effectively
 

1359
00:22:27,600 --> 00:22:28,950
is just a user interface effectively
and then the physicists are finding that

1360
00:22:28,950 --> 00:22:28,960
and then the physicists are finding that
 

1361
00:22:28,960 --> 00:22:31,350
and then the physicists are finding that
even the mathematical extension of that

1362
00:22:31,350 --> 00:22:31,360
even the mathematical extension of that
 

1363
00:22:31,360 --> 00:22:34,230
even the mathematical extension of that
into the einsteinian formulation

1364
00:22:34,230 --> 00:22:34,240
into the einsteinian formulation

1367
00:22:36,880 --> 00:22:39,110
has to be as well um not the final story
there's something deeper so let me ask

1368
00:22:39,110 --> 00:22:39,120
there's something deeper so let me ask
 

1369
00:22:39,120 --> 00:22:43,110
there's something deeper so let me ask
you about reductionism and interfaces

1370
00:22:43,110 --> 00:22:43,120
you about reductionism and interfaces
 

1371
00:22:43,120 --> 00:22:45,110
you about reductionism and interfaces

1383
00:22:56,080 --> 00:22:57,990

the reason we like those interfaces is

1394
00:23:06,950 --> 00:23:06,960
the reason we like those interfaces is
 

1395
00:23:06,960 --> 00:23:08,950
the reason we like those interfaces is
because they're predictive of some

1396
00:23:08,950 --> 00:23:08,960
because they're predictive of some
 

1397
00:23:08,960 --> 00:23:11,510
because they're predictive of some
aspects strongly predictive about some

well of course one critical constraint

00:23:24,390 --> 00:23:24,400
well of course one critical constraint
 

1411
00:23:24,400 --> 00:23:25,909
well of course one critical constraint
on all of our theories is that they are

1412
00:23:25,909 --> 00:23:25,919
on all of our theories is that they are
 

1413
00:23:25,919 --> 00:23:28,549
on all of our theories is that they are
empirically tested and past

empirically tested and past
 

1415
00:23:28,559 --> 00:23:30,149

the experiments that we
 

1417
00:23:30,159 --> 00:23:32,390
the experiments that we
have for them so so no one's arguing

1418
00:23:32,390 --> 00:23:32,400
have for them so so no one's arguing
 

1419
00:23:32,400 --> 00:23:35,029
have for them so so no one's arguing
against experiments being important and

but
 

1433
00:23:46,159 --> 00:23:48,789
but
we have good reason to believe

1434
00:23:48,789 --> 00:23:48,799
we have good reason to believe

00:23:48,799 --> 00:23:50,390
we have good reason to believe

the best scientific theories
indian physics for example and also now

1484
00:24:33,190 --> 00:24:33,200
indian physics for example and also now
 

1485
00:24:33,200 --> 00:24:35,190
indian physics for example and also now
evolution are mathematical so our

1486
00:24:35,190 --> 00:24:35,200
evolution are mathematical so our
 

1487
00:24:35,200 --> 00:24:36,390
evolution are mathematical so our
theories are going to be they're going

1488
00:24:36,390 --> 00:24:36,400
theories are going to be they're going
 

1489
00:24:36,400 --> 00:24:38,310
theories are going to be they're going
to have their own assumptions

1490
00:24:38,310 --> 00:24:38,320
to have their own assumptions
 

1491
00:24:38,320 --> 00:24:39,909
to have their own assumptions
and um

1492
00:24:39,909 --> 00:24:39,919
and um
 

1493
00:24:39,919 --> 00:24:41,750
and um
they'll be mathematically precise and

1494
00:24:41,750 --> 00:24:41,760
they'll be mathematically precise and
 

1495
00:24:41,760 --> 00:24:42,870
they'll be mathematically precise and
they'll be theories perhaps of

1496
00:24:42,870 --> 00:24:42,880
they'll be theories perhaps of
 

1497
00:24:42,880 --> 00:24:44,230
they'll be theories perhaps of
everything except those assumptions

1498
00:24:44,230 --> 00:24:44,240
everything except those assumptions
 

1499
00:24:44,240 --> 00:24:46,549
everything except those assumptions
because the assumptions are

1500
00:24:46,549 --> 00:24:46,559
because the assumptions are
 

1501
00:24:46,559 --> 00:24:48,149
because the assumptions are
we say please grant me these assumptions

1502
00:24:48,149 --> 00:24:48,159
we say please grant me these assumptions
 

1503
00:24:48,159 --> 00:24:49,510
we say please grant me these assumptions
if you grant me these assumptions then i

1504
00:24:49,510 --> 00:24:49,520
if you grant me these assumptions then i
 

1505
00:24:49,520 --> 00:24:51,350
if you grant me these assumptions then i
can explain this other stuff

1506
00:24:51,350 --> 00:24:51,360
can explain this other stuff
 

1507
00:24:51,360 --> 00:24:54,290
can explain this other stuff
but so you have the assumptions that um

1508
00:24:54,290 --> 00:24:54,300
but so you have the assumptions that um
 

1509
00:24:54,300 --> 00:24:55,750
but so you have the assumptions that um

are

1512
00:24:56,549 --> 00:24:56,559
are
 

1513
00:24:56,559 --> 00:24:58,230
are
like miracles as far as the theory is

1514
00:24:58,230 --> 00:24:58,240
like miracles as far as the theory is
 

1515
00:24:58,240 --> 00:24:59,510
like miracles as far as the theory is
concerned they're not explained they're

1516
00:24:59,510 --> 00:24:59,520
concerned they're not explained they're
 

1517
00:24:59,520 --> 00:25:01,669
concerned they're not explained they're
the starting points for explanation and

1518
00:25:01,669 --> 00:25:01,679
the starting points for explanation and
 

1519
00:25:01,679 --> 00:25:03,029
the starting points for explanation and
then you have the mathematical structure

1520
00:25:03,029 --> 00:25:03,039
then you have the mathematical structure
 

1521
00:25:03,039 --> 00:25:05,990
then you have the mathematical structure
of the theory itself which will have the

1522
00:25:05,990 --> 00:25:06,000
of the theory itself which will have the
 

1523
00:25:06,000 --> 00:25:07,430
of the theory itself which will have the
girdle limits

1524
00:25:07,430 --> 00:25:07,440
girdle limits
 

1525
00:25:07,440 --> 00:25:10,310
girdle limits
and so

1526
00:25:10,310 --> 00:25:10,320

 

1527
00:25:10,320 --> 00:25:13,110

my my take is that um reality whatever

1528
00:25:13,110 --> 00:25:13,120
my my take is that um reality whatever
 

1529
00:25:13,120 --> 00:25:15,110
my my take is that um reality whatever
it is is

1530
00:25:15,110 --> 00:25:15,120
it is is
 

1531
00:25:15,120 --> 00:25:18,070
it is is
always going to transcend

1532
00:25:18,070 --> 00:25:18,080
always going to transcend
 

1533
00:25:18,080 --> 00:25:20,310
always going to transcend
any

1534
00:25:20,310 --> 00:25:20,320
any
 

1535
00:25:20,320 --> 00:25:21,909
any
conceptual theory that we can come up

1536
00:25:21,909 --> 00:25:21,919
conceptual theory that we can come up
 

1537
00:25:21,919 --> 00:25:23,350
conceptual theory that we can come up
with there's always going to be mystery

1538
00:25:23,350 --> 00:25:23,360
with there's always going to be mystery
 

1539
00:25:23,360 --> 00:25:26,789
with there's always going to be mystery
at the edges

1540
00:25:26,789 --> 00:25:26,799

 

1541
00:25:26,799 --> 00:25:28,630

right uh contradictions and all that

1542
00:25:28,630 --> 00:25:28,640
right uh contradictions and all that
 

1543
00:25:28,640 --> 00:25:31,350
right uh contradictions and all that
kind of stuff okay

1544
00:25:31,350 --> 00:25:31,360
kind of stuff okay
 

1545
00:25:31,360 --> 00:25:32,710
kind of stuff okay
and truths

1546
00:25:32,710 --> 00:25:32,720
and truths
 

1547
00:25:32,720 --> 00:25:34,549
and truths
so there's an this idea that is brought

1548
00:25:34,549 --> 00:25:34,559
so there's an this idea that is brought
 

1549
00:25:34,559 --> 00:25:36,789
so there's an this idea that is brought
up in the financial space of uh

1550
00:25:36,789 --> 00:25:36,799
up in the financial space of uh
 

1551
00:25:36,799 --> 00:25:39,269
up in the financial space of uh
settlement of transactions

1552
00:25:39,269 --> 00:25:39,279
settlement of transactions
 

1553
00:25:39,279 --> 00:25:40,710
settlement of transactions
it's often talked about in

1554
00:25:40,710 --> 00:25:40,720
it's often talked about in
 

1555
00:25:40,720 --> 00:25:42,390
it's often talked about in
cryptocurrency especially

1556
00:25:42,390 --> 00:25:42,400
cryptocurrency especially
 

1557
00:25:42,400 --> 00:25:44,710
cryptocurrency especially
so you could do you know money cash is

1558
00:25:44,710 --> 00:25:44,720
so you could do you know money cash is
 

1559
00:25:44,720 --> 00:25:47,029
so you could do you know money cash is
not connected to

00:25:47,029 --> 00:25:47,039
not connected to
 

1561
00:25:47,039 --> 00:25:48,149
not connected to
anything

1562
00:25:48,149 --> 00:25:48,159
anything
 

1563
00:25:48,159 --> 00:25:50,870
anything
uh it used to be connected to gold

1564
00:25:50,870 --> 00:25:50,880
uh it used to be connected to gold
 

1565
00:25:50,880 --> 00:25:52,789
uh it used to be connected to gold
to physical reality but then you can use

1566
00:25:52,789 --> 00:25:52,799
to physical reality but then you can use
 

1567
00:25:52,799 --> 00:25:55,269
to physical reality but then you can use
money to exchange uh to exchange value

1568
00:25:55,269 --> 00:25:55,279
money to exchange uh to exchange value
 

1569
00:25:55,279 --> 00:25:56,789
money to exchange uh to exchange value
to transact

1570
00:25:56,789 --> 00:25:56,799
to transact
 

1571
00:25:56,799 --> 00:25:59,669
to transact
uh so when it was on the gold standard

1572
00:25:59,669 --> 00:25:59,679
uh so when it was on the gold standard
 

1573
00:25:59,679 --> 00:26:01,990
uh so when it was on the gold standard
the money would represent some

1574
00:26:01,990 --> 00:26:02,000
the money would represent some
 

1575
00:26:02,000 --> 00:26:03,190
the money would represent some
stable

1576
00:26:03,190 --> 00:26:03,200
stable
 

1577
00:26:03,200 --> 00:26:06,789
stable
uh component of reality isn't it

1578
00:26:06,789 --> 00:26:06,799
uh component of reality isn't it
 

1579
00:26:06,799 --> 00:26:09,350
uh component of reality isn't it
more effective

1580
00:26:09,350 --> 00:26:09,360
more effective
 

1581
00:26:09,360 --> 00:26:12,149
more effective
to avoid things like hyperinflation

1582
00:26:12,149 --> 00:26:12,159
to avoid things like hyperinflation
 

1583
00:26:12,159 --> 00:26:15,590
to avoid things like hyperinflation
if we generalize that idea isn't it

1584
00:26:15,590 --> 00:26:15,600
if we generalize that idea isn't it
 

1585
00:26:15,600 --> 00:26:16,630
if we generalize that idea isn't it
better

1586
00:26:16,630 --> 00:26:16,640
better
 

1587
00:26:16,640 --> 00:26:18,950
better
to connect your

1588
00:26:18,950 --> 00:26:18,960
to connect your
 

1589
00:26:18,960 --> 00:26:20,549
to connect your
uh whatever we humans are doing in the

uh whatever we humans are doing in the
 

1591
00:26:20,559 --> 00:26:22,950

from an evolutionary perspective to

from an evolutionary perspective to
 

1597
00:26:26,000 --> 00:26:28,070
from an evolutionary perspective to
connect it to some degree to reality so

1598
00:26:28,070 --> 00:26:28,080
connect it to some degree to reality so
 

1599
00:26:28,080 --> 00:26:31,510
connect it to some degree to reality so
that the the transactions are settled

1600
00:26:31,510 --> 00:26:31,520
that the the transactions are settled
 

1601
00:26:31,520 --> 00:26:33,750
that the the transactions are settled
with something that's universal as

with something that's universal as

something that's a complete illusion
 

1607
00:26:38,159 --> 00:26:41,269
something that's a complete illusion
isn't it easy to hyperinflate that

1608
00:26:41,269 --> 00:26:41,279
isn't it easy to hyperinflate that
 

1609
00:26:41,279 --> 00:26:43,909
isn't it easy to hyperinflate that
like when where you really deviate very

1610
00:26:43,909 --> 00:26:43,919
like when where you really deviate very
 

1611
00:26:43,919 --> 00:26:46,070
like when where you really deviate very
very far away

um
 

1617
00:26:49,520 --> 00:26:51,190
um
from the underlying reality or do you

00:26:51,190 --> 00:26:51,200
from the underlying reality or do you
 

1619
00:26:51,200 --> 00:26:53,590
from the underlying reality or do you
not never get in trouble for this

1620
00:26:53,590 --> 00:26:53,600
not never get in trouble for this
 

1621
00:26:53,600 --> 00:26:57,110
not never get in trouble for this
can you just completely drift far far

1622
00:26:57,110 --> 00:26:57,120
can you just completely drift far far
 

1623
00:26:57,120 --> 00:26:58,070
can you just completely drift far far
away

1624
00:26:58,070 --> 00:26:58,080
away
 

1625
00:26:58,080 --> 00:27:00,149

get in trouble
 

1629
00:27:01,440 --> 00:27:02,710
get in trouble
that's a great question

1630
00:27:02,710 --> 00:27:02,720
that's a great question
 

1631
00:27:02,720 --> 00:27:04,310
that's a great question
on the financial side

1632
00:27:04,310 --> 00:27:04,320
on the financial side
 

1633
00:27:04,320 --> 00:27:05,830
on the financial side
there's two levels at least that we

1634
00:27:05,830 --> 00:27:05,840
there's two levels at least that we
 

1635
00:27:05,840 --> 00:27:07,430
there's two levels at least that we
could take your question one one is

1636
00:27:07,430 --> 00:27:07,440
could take your question one one is
 

1637
00:27:07,440 --> 00:27:09,830
could take your question one one is
strictly like evolutionary psychology of

1638
00:27:09,830 --> 00:27:09,840
strictly like evolutionary psychology of
 

1639
00:27:09,840 --> 00:27:12,070
strictly like evolutionary psychology of
financial systems um and that's that's

1640
00:27:12,070 --> 00:27:12,080
financial systems um and that's that's
 

1641
00:27:12,080 --> 00:27:13,909
financial systems um and that's that's
pretty interesting um and there the

1642
00:27:13,909 --> 00:27:13,919
pretty interesting um and there the
 

1643
00:27:13,919 --> 00:27:16,390
pretty interesting um and there the
decentralized idea that the d5 kind of

1644
00:27:16,390 --> 00:27:16,400
decentralized idea that the d5 kind of
 

1645
00:27:16,400 --> 00:27:18,789
decentralized idea that the d5 kind of
idea in cryptocurrencies

1646
00:27:18,789 --> 00:27:18,799
idea in cryptocurrencies
 

1647
00:27:18,799 --> 00:27:20,310
idea in cryptocurrencies
may make good sense from just an

1648
00:27:20,310 --> 00:27:20,320
may make good sense from just an
 

1649
00:27:20,320 --> 00:27:22,389
may make good sense from just an
evolutionary psychology point of view

1650
00:27:22,389 --> 00:27:22,399
evolutionary psychology point of view
 

1651
00:27:22,399 --> 00:27:24,310
evolutionary psychology point of view
having you know human nature being what

1652
00:27:24,310 --> 00:27:24,320
having you know human nature being what
 

1653
00:27:24,320 --> 00:27:25,590
having you know human nature being what
it is

1654
00:27:25,590 --> 00:27:25,600
it is
 

1655
00:27:25,600 --> 00:27:26,870
it is
putting a lot of

1656
00:27:26,870 --> 00:27:26,880
putting a lot of
 

1657
00:27:26,880 --> 00:27:30,470
putting a lot of
faith in a few central controllers

1658
00:27:30,470 --> 00:27:30,480
faith in a few central controllers
 

1659
00:27:30,480 --> 00:27:33,029
faith in a few central controllers
depends a lot on the

1660
00:27:33,029 --> 00:27:33,039
depends a lot on the
 

1661
00:27:33,039 --> 00:27:35,510
depends a lot on the
veracity of those and trustworthiness of

1662
00:27:35,510 --> 00:27:35,520
veracity of those and trustworthiness of
 

1663
00:27:35,520 --> 00:27:37,590
veracity of those and trustworthiness of
those few central controllers and we

1664
00:27:37,590 --> 00:27:37,600
those few central controllers and we
 

1665
00:27:37,600 --> 00:27:39,590
those few central controllers and we
have ample evidence time and again that

1666
00:27:39,590 --> 00:27:39,600
have ample evidence time and again that
 

1667
00:27:39,600 --> 00:27:41,830
have ample evidence time and again that
um that's often betrayed

1668
00:27:41,830 --> 00:27:41,840
um that's often betrayed
 

1669
00:27:41,840 --> 00:27:44,310
um that's often betrayed
so it makes good evolutionary sense i

1670
00:27:44,310 --> 00:27:44,320
so it makes good evolutionary sense i
 

1671
00:27:44,320 --> 00:27:46,950
so it makes good evolutionary sense i
would say to have a decentralized i mean

1672
00:27:46,950 --> 00:27:46,960
would say to have a decentralized i mean
 

1673
00:27:46,960 --> 00:27:48,549
would say to have a decentralized i mean
democracy is a step in that direction

1674
00:27:48,549 --> 00:27:48,559
democracy is a step in that direction
 

1675
00:27:48,559 --> 00:27:50,630
democracy is a step in that direction
right we're we don't we don't have a

1676
00:27:50,630 --> 00:27:50,640
right we're we don't we don't have a
 

1677
00:27:50,640 --> 00:27:53,110
right we're we don't we don't have a
monarch now telling us what to do we

1678
00:27:53,110 --> 00:27:53,120
monarch now telling us what to do we
 

1679
00:27:53,120 --> 00:27:55,190
monarch now telling us what to do we
decentralize things right because if the

1680
00:27:55,190 --> 00:27:55,200
decentralize things right because if the
 

1681
00:27:55,200 --> 00:27:57,190
decentralize things right because if the
monarch if you have marcus aurelius as

1682
00:27:57,190 --> 00:27:57,200
monarch if you have marcus aurelius as
 

1683
00:27:57,200 --> 00:27:58,789
monarch if you have marcus aurelius as
your emperor you're great if you have

1684
00:27:58,789 --> 00:27:58,799
your emperor you're great if you have
 

1685
00:27:58,799 --> 00:27:59,830
your emperor you're great if you have
nero

1686
00:27:59,830 --> 00:27:59,840
nero
 

1687
00:27:59,840 --> 00:28:01,990
nero
it's not so great and so we don't want

1688
00:28:01,990 --> 00:28:02,000
it's not so great and so we don't want
 

1689
00:28:02,000 --> 00:28:03,750
it's not so great and so we don't want
that so democracy is a step in that

1690
00:28:03,750 --> 00:28:03,760
that so democracy is a step in that
 

1691
00:28:03,760 --> 00:28:06,470
that so democracy is a step in that
direction but but i think the defy

1692
00:28:06,470 --> 00:28:06,480
direction but but i think the defy
 

1693
00:28:06,480 --> 00:28:09,590
direction but but i think the defy
thing is is an even bigger step and is

1694
00:28:09,590 --> 00:28:09,600
thing is is an even bigger step and is
 

1695
00:28:09,600 --> 00:28:11,269
thing is is an even bigger step and is
is going to even make the

1696
00:28:11,269 --> 00:28:11,279
is going to even make the
 

1697
00:28:11,279 --> 00:28:13,669
is going to even make the
democratization even even greater so so

1698
00:28:13,669 --> 00:28:13,679
democratization even even greater so so
 

1699
00:28:13,679 --> 00:28:15,669
democratization even even greater so so
that's one level also the fact that

1700
00:28:15,669 --> 00:28:15,679
that's one level also the fact that
 

1701
00:28:15,679 --> 00:28:17,029
that's one level also the fact that
power corrupts and absolute power

1702
00:28:17,029 --> 00:28:17,039
power corrupts and absolute power
 

1703
00:28:17,039 --> 00:28:19,430
power corrupts and absolute power
corrupts absolutely is also

1704
00:28:19,430 --> 00:28:19,440
corrupts absolutely is also
 

1705
00:28:19,440 --> 00:28:21,669
corrupts absolutely is also
an evolut a consequence of

1706
00:28:21,669 --> 00:28:21,679
an evolut a consequence of
 

1707
00:28:21,679 --> 00:28:23,830
an evolut a consequence of
evolution

1708
00:28:23,830 --> 00:28:23,840
evolution
 

1709
00:28:23,840 --> 00:28:26,470
evolution
right that's also a feature i think

1710
00:28:26,470 --> 00:28:26,480
right that's also a feature i think
 

1711
00:28:26,480 --> 00:28:28,630
right that's also a feature i think
right you can argue from the long span

1712
00:28:28,630 --> 00:28:28,640
right you can argue from the long span
 

1713
00:28:28,640 --> 00:28:31,750
right you can argue from the long span
of living organisms it's nice for power

1714
00:28:31,750 --> 00:28:31,760
of living organisms it's nice for power
 

1715
00:28:31,760 --> 00:28:34,549
of living organisms it's nice for power
to corrupt for you to it so

1716
00:28:34,549 --> 00:28:34,559
to corrupt for you to it so
 

1717
00:28:34,559 --> 00:28:35,830
to corrupt for you to it so
uh

1718
00:28:35,830 --> 00:28:35,840
uh
 

1719
00:28:35,840 --> 00:28:38,710
uh
mad men and women throughout history

1720
00:28:38,710 --> 00:28:38,720
mad men and women throughout history
 

1721
00:28:38,720 --> 00:28:41,110
mad men and women throughout history
might be useful to teach

1722
00:28:41,110 --> 00:28:41,120
might be useful to teach
 

1723
00:28:41,120 --> 00:28:42,789
might be useful to teach
us a lesson

1724
00:28:42,789 --> 00:28:42,799
us a lesson
 

1725
00:28:42,799 --> 00:28:44,389
us a lesson
we can learn from our negative example

1726
00:28:44,389 --> 00:28:44,399
we can learn from our negative example
 

1727
00:28:44,399 --> 00:28:47,269
we can learn from our negative example
right exactly right right

1728
00:28:47,269 --> 00:28:47,279
right exactly right right
 

1729
00:28:47,279 --> 00:28:49,269
right exactly right right
right so power does corrupt and i think

1730
00:28:49,269 --> 00:28:49,279
right so power does corrupt and i think
 

1731
00:28:49,279 --> 00:28:50,149
right so power does corrupt and i think
that

1732
00:28:50,149 --> 00:28:50,159
that
 

1733
00:28:50,159 --> 00:28:51,350
that
you can think about that again from an

1734
00:28:51,350 --> 00:28:51,360
you can think about that again from an
 

1735
00:28:51,360 --> 00:28:53,430
you can think about that again from an
evolutionary point of view

1736
00:28:53,430 --> 00:28:53,440
evolutionary point of view
 

1737
00:28:53,440 --> 00:28:54,870
evolutionary point of view
but i think that your question was a

1738
00:28:54,870 --> 00:28:54,880
but i think that your question was a
 

1739
00:28:54,880 --> 00:28:57,029
but i think that your question was a
little deeper when that was

1740
00:28:57,029 --> 00:28:57,039
little deeper when that was
 

1741
00:28:57,039 --> 00:28:59,750
little deeper when that was
is does the evolutionary

1742
00:28:59,750 --> 00:28:59,760
is does the evolutionary
 

1743
00:28:59,760 --> 00:29:01,430
is does the evolutionary
interface idea

1744
00:29:01,430 --> 00:29:01,440
interface idea
 

1745
00:29:01,440 --> 00:29:04,870
interface idea
sort of unhinge science from

1746
00:29:04,870 --> 00:29:04,880
sort of unhinge science from
 

1747
00:29:04,880 --> 00:29:06,710
sort of unhinge science from
from some kind of

00:29:06,710 --> 00:29:06,720
from some kind of
 

1749
00:29:06,720 --> 00:29:08,789
from some kind of
important test for the theories right we

1750
00:29:08,789 --> 00:29:08,799
important test for the theories right we
 

1751
00:29:08,799 --> 00:29:10,310
important test for the theories right we
don't want it

1752
00:29:10,310 --> 00:29:10,320
don't want it
 

1753
00:29:10,320 --> 00:29:12,389
don't want it
doesn't mean that anything goes in

1754
00:29:12,389 --> 00:29:12,399
doesn't mean that anything goes in
 

1755
00:29:12,399 --> 00:29:14,389
doesn't mean that anything goes in
scientific theory but there's no

1756
00:29:14,389 --> 00:29:14,399
scientific theory but there's no
 

1757
00:29:14,399 --> 00:29:15,830
scientific theory but there's no
if there if we don't see the truth is

1758
00:29:15,830 --> 00:29:15,840
if there if we don't see the truth is
 

1759
00:29:15,840 --> 00:29:17,590
if there if we don't see the truth is
there no way to tether our theories and

1760
00:29:17,590 --> 00:29:17,600
there no way to tether our theories and
 

1761
00:29:17,600 --> 00:29:22,710
there no way to tether our theories and
test them and and i think

1762
00:29:22,710 --> 00:29:22,720

 

1763
00:29:22,720 --> 00:29:25,029

there there's no problem there we we can

1764
00:29:25,029 --> 00:29:25,039
there there's no problem there we we can
 

1765
00:29:25,039 --> 00:29:26,950
there there's no problem there we we can
only test things in terms of what we can

1766
00:29:26,950 --> 00:29:26,960
only test things in terms of what we can
 

1767
00:29:26,960 --> 00:29:29,110
only test things in terms of what we can
measure with our senses in space and

1768
00:29:29,110 --> 00:29:29,120
measure with our senses in space and
 

1769
00:29:29,120 --> 00:29:30,870
measure with our senses in space and
time so

1770
00:29:30,870 --> 00:29:30,880
time so
 

1771
00:29:30,880 --> 00:29:32,389
time so
we're going to have to continue to do

1772
00:29:32,389 --> 00:29:32,399
we're going to have to continue to do
 

1773
00:29:32,399 --> 00:29:34,870
we're going to have to continue to do
experiments and but we're going to re

1774
00:29:34,870 --> 00:29:34,880
experiments and but we're going to re
 

1775
00:29:34,880 --> 00:29:36,389
experiments and but we're going to re
we're going to understand a little bit

1776
00:29:36,389 --> 00:29:36,399
we're going to understand a little bit
 

1777
00:29:36,399 --> 00:29:38,789
we're going to understand a little bit
differently what those experiments are

1778
00:29:38,789 --> 00:29:38,799
differently what those experiments are
 

1779
00:29:38,799 --> 00:29:41,190
differently what those experiments are
we had thought that when we see

1780
00:29:41,190 --> 00:29:41,200
we had thought that when we see
 

1781
00:29:41,200 --> 00:29:42,870
we had thought that when we see
a pointer on a

1782
00:29:42,870 --> 00:29:42,880
a pointer on a
 

1783
00:29:42,880 --> 00:29:44,630
a pointer on a
some machine in a you know

1784
00:29:44,630 --> 00:29:44,640
some machine in a you know
 

1785
00:29:44,640 --> 00:29:47,190
some machine in a you know
an experiment that the machine exists

1786
00:29:47,190 --> 00:29:47,200
an experiment that the machine exists
 

1787
00:29:47,200 --> 00:29:48,870
an experiment that the machine exists
the pointer exists and the values exist

1788
00:29:48,870 --> 00:29:48,880
the pointer exists and the values exist
 

1789
00:29:48,880 --> 00:29:51,350
the pointer exists and the values exist
even when no one is looking at them and

1790
00:29:51,350 --> 00:29:51,360
even when no one is looking at them and
 

1791
00:29:51,360 --> 00:29:53,510
even when no one is looking at them and
that they're an objective truth and and

1792
00:29:53,510 --> 00:29:53,520
that they're an objective truth and and
 

1793
00:29:53,520 --> 00:29:55,430
that they're an objective truth and and
our best theories are telling us no the

1794
00:29:55,430 --> 00:29:55,440
our best theories are telling us no the
 

1795
00:29:55,440 --> 00:29:56,389
our best theories are telling us no the
pointers

1796
00:29:56,389 --> 00:29:56,399
pointers
 

1797
00:29:56,399 --> 00:29:58,310
pointers
pointers are just pointers

1798
00:29:58,310 --> 00:29:58,320
pointers are just pointers
 

1799
00:29:58,320 --> 00:30:00,870
pointers are just pointers
and that's what you have to rely on for

1800
00:30:00,870 --> 00:30:00,880
and that's what you have to rely on for
 

1801
00:30:00,880 --> 00:30:02,310
and that's what you have to rely on for
making your judgments

1802
00:30:02,310 --> 00:30:02,320
making your judgments
 

1803
00:30:02,320 --> 00:30:04,070
making your judgments
um but

1804
00:30:04,070 --> 00:30:04,080
um but
 

1805
00:30:04,080 --> 00:30:05,669
um but
um

1806
00:30:05,669 --> 00:30:05,679
um
 

1807
00:30:05,679 --> 00:30:07,669
um
that even the pointers themselves are

1808
00:30:07,669 --> 00:30:07,679
that even the pointers themselves are
 

1809
00:30:07,679 --> 00:30:08,710
that even the pointers themselves are
not

00:30:08,720 --> 00:30:10,389
not
the objective reality

1812
00:30:10,389 --> 00:30:10,399
the objective reality
 

1813
00:30:10,399 --> 00:30:12,389
the objective reality
so and and i think girdle is telling us

1814
00:30:12,389 --> 00:30:12,399
so and and i think girdle is telling us
 

1815
00:30:12,399 --> 00:30:13,430
so and and i think girdle is telling us
that

1816
00:30:13,430 --> 00:30:13,440
that
 

1817
00:30:13,440 --> 00:30:16,470
that
not that um anything goes but

1818
00:30:16,470 --> 00:30:16,480
not that um anything goes but
 

1819
00:30:16,480 --> 00:30:18,230
not that um anything goes but
you know as you develop new axiom

1820
00:30:18,230 --> 00:30:18,240
you know as you develop new axiom
 

1821
00:30:18,240 --> 00:30:19,510
you know as you develop new axiom
systems you will find out what goes

1822
00:30:19,510 --> 00:30:19,520
systems you will find out what goes
 

1823
00:30:19,520 --> 00:30:21,430
systems you will find out what goes
within that axiom system

1824
00:30:21,430 --> 00:30:21,440
within that axiom system
 

1825
00:30:21,440 --> 00:30:23,110
within that axiom system
and what what testable predictions you

1826
00:30:23,110 --> 00:30:23,120
and what what testable predictions you
 

1827
00:30:23,120 --> 00:30:25,029
and what what testable predictions you
can make so i don't think we're we're

1828
00:30:25,029 --> 00:30:25,039
can make so i don't think we're we're
 

1829
00:30:25,039 --> 00:30:26,789
can make so i don't think we're we're
untethered we we continue to do

1830
00:30:26,789 --> 00:30:26,799
untethered we we continue to do
 

1831
00:30:26,799 --> 00:30:29,269
untethered we we continue to do
experiments what i think we

1832
00:30:29,269 --> 00:30:29,279
experiments what i think we
 

1833
00:30:29,279 --> 00:30:31,029
experiments what i think we
won't have that we want

1834
00:30:31,029 --> 00:30:31,039
won't have that we want
 

1835
00:30:31,039 --> 00:30:33,830
won't have that we want
is a conceptual understanding

1836
00:30:33,830 --> 00:30:33,840
is a conceptual understanding
 

1837
00:30:33,840 --> 00:30:35,350
is a conceptual understanding
that gives us a theory of everything

1838
00:30:35,350 --> 00:30:35,360
that gives us a theory of everything
 

1839
00:30:35,360 --> 00:30:38,070
that gives us a theory of everything
that's final and complete i i think that

1840
00:30:38,070 --> 00:30:38,080
that's final and complete i i think that
 

1841
00:30:38,080 --> 00:30:39,029
that's final and complete i i think that
this is

1842
00:30:39,029 --> 00:30:39,039
this is
 

1843
00:30:39,039 --> 00:30:40,950
this is
to put it another way this is job

because
 

1853
00:30:48,559 --> 00:30:49,990
because
before we thought that when we looked in

00:30:49,990 --> 00:30:50,000
before we thought that when we looked in
 

1855
00:30:50,000 --> 00:30:51,830
before we thought that when we looked in
the brain we saw neurons and neural

1856
00:30:51,830 --> 00:30:51,840
the brain we saw neurons and neural
 

1857
00:30:51,840 --> 00:30:53,510
the brain we saw neurons and neural
networks and

1858
00:30:53,510 --> 00:30:53,520
networks and
 

1859
00:30:53,520 --> 00:30:56,149
networks and
and uh you know action potentials and

1860
00:30:56,149 --> 00:30:56,159
and uh you know action potentials and
 

1861
00:30:56,159 --> 00:30:58,070
and uh you know action potentials and
and synapses and so forth and that's

1862
00:30:58,070 --> 00:30:58,080
and synapses and so forth and that's
 

1863
00:30:58,080 --> 00:31:00,230
and synapses and so forth and that's
that was it that that was the reality

1864
00:31:00,230 --> 00:31:00,240
that was it that that was the reality
 

1865
00:31:00,240 --> 00:31:01,750
that was it that that was the reality
now we have to reverse engineer that we

1866
00:31:01,750 --> 00:31:01,760
now we have to reverse engineer that we
 

1867
00:31:01,760 --> 00:31:04,630
now we have to reverse engineer that we
have to say what is beyond space time

1868
00:31:04,630 --> 00:31:04,640
have to say what is beyond space time
 

1869
00:31:04,640 --> 00:31:06,549
have to say what is beyond space time
what is going on what is a dynamical

1870
00:31:06,549 --> 00:31:06,559
what is going on what is a dynamical
 

1871
00:31:06,559 --> 00:31:08,630
what is going on what is a dynamical
system beyond space time that when we

1872
00:31:08,630 --> 00:31:08,640
system beyond space time that when we
 

1873
00:31:08,640 --> 00:31:10,389
system beyond space time that when we
project it into einstein space time

1874
00:31:10,389 --> 00:31:10,399
project it into einstein space time
 

1875
00:31:10,399 --> 00:31:12,149
project it into einstein space time
gives us things that look like neurons

1876
00:31:12,149 --> 00:31:12,159
gives us things that look like neurons
 

1877
00:31:12,159 --> 00:31:14,549
gives us things that look like neurons
and neural networks and synapses

1878
00:31:14,549 --> 00:31:14,559
and neural networks and synapses
 

1879
00:31:14,559 --> 00:31:16,549
and neural networks and synapses
that's so we have to reverse engineer so

1880
00:31:16,549 --> 00:31:16,559
that's so we have to reverse engineer so
 

1881
00:31:16,559 --> 00:31:17,830
that's so we have to reverse engineer so
there's going to be lots more work for

1882
00:31:17,830 --> 00:31:17,840
there's going to be lots more work for
 

1883
00:31:17,840 --> 00:31:20,070
there's going to be lots more work for
neuroscience it's going to be far more

1884
00:31:20,070 --> 00:31:20,080
neuroscience it's going to be far more
 

1885
00:31:20,080 --> 00:31:22,789
neuroscience it's going to be far more
complicated and difficult and

1886
00:31:22,789 --> 00:31:22,799
complicated and difficult and
 

1887
00:31:22,799 --> 00:31:24,950
complicated and difficult and
challenging but but that's wonderful

1888
00:31:24,950 --> 00:31:24,960
challenging but but that's wonderful
 

1889
00:31:24,960 --> 00:31:26,230
challenging but but that's wonderful
that's what we need to do we thought

1890
00:31:26,230 --> 00:31:26,240
that's what we need to do we thought
 

1891
00:31:26,240 --> 00:31:28,310
that's what we need to do we thought
neurons exist when they aren't perceived

1892
00:31:28,310 --> 00:31:28,320
neurons exist when they aren't perceived
 

1893
00:31:28,320 --> 00:31:30,149
neurons exist when they aren't perceived
and they don't in the same way that if i

1894
00:31:30,149 --> 00:31:30,159
and they don't in the same way that if i
 

1895
00:31:30,159 --> 00:31:32,070
and they don't in the same way that if i
show you when i say they don't exist i

1896
00:31:32,070 --> 00:31:32,080
show you when i say they don't exist i
 

1897
00:31:32,080 --> 00:31:34,230
show you when i say they don't exist i
should be very very concrete

1898
00:31:34,230 --> 00:31:34,240
should be very very concrete
 

1899
00:31:34,240 --> 00:31:36,630
should be very very concrete
if i draw on a piece of paper a little

1900
00:31:36,630 --> 00:31:36,640
if i draw on a piece of paper a little
 

1901
00:31:36,640 --> 00:31:38,070
if i draw on a piece of paper a little
sketch

1902
00:31:38,070 --> 00:31:38,080
sketch
 

1903
00:31:38,080 --> 00:31:40,070

of something that is called the necker

1904
00:31:40,070 --> 00:31:40,080
of something that is called the necker
 

1905
00:31:40,080 --> 00:31:42,149
of something that is called the necker
cube it's just a little line drawing of

1906
00:31:42,149 --> 00:31:42,159
cube it's just a little line drawing of
 

1907
00:31:42,159 --> 00:31:44,070
cube it's just a little line drawing of
a cube right on a flat piece of paper if

1908
00:31:44,070 --> 00:31:44,080
a cube right on a flat piece of paper if
 

1909
00:31:44,080 --> 00:31:46,070
a cube right on a flat piece of paper if
i execute it well and i show it to you

1910
00:31:46,070 --> 00:31:46,080
i execute it well and i show it to you
 

1911
00:31:46,080 --> 00:31:47,990
i execute it well and i show it to you
you'll see a 3d cube and you'll see it

1912
00:31:47,990 --> 00:31:48,000
you'll see a 3d cube and you'll see it
 

1913
00:31:48,000 --> 00:31:49,430
you'll see a 3d cube and you'll see it
flip sometimes you'll see one face in

1914
00:31:49,430 --> 00:31:49,440
flip sometimes you'll see one face in
 

1915
00:31:49,440 --> 00:31:50,470
flip sometimes you'll see one face in
front sometimes you'll see the other

1916
00:31:50,470 --> 00:31:50,480
front sometimes you'll see the other
 

1917
00:31:50,480 --> 00:31:51,669
front sometimes you'll see the other
face in front

1918
00:31:51,669 --> 00:31:51,679
face in front
 

1919
00:31:51,679 --> 00:31:53,110
face in front
but if i ask you know

1920
00:31:53,110 --> 00:31:53,120
but if i ask you know
 

1921
00:31:53,120 --> 00:31:54,630
but if i ask you know
which face is in front when you don't

1922
00:31:54,630 --> 00:31:54,640
which face is in front when you don't
 

1923
00:31:54,640 --> 00:31:55,909
which face is in front when you don't
look

1924
00:31:55,909 --> 00:31:55,919
look
 

1925
00:31:55,919 --> 00:31:57,190
look
you know

1926
00:31:57,190 --> 00:31:57,200
you know
 

1927
00:31:57,200 --> 00:31:59,269
you know
the answer is well neither face is in

1928
00:31:59,269 --> 00:31:59,279
the answer is well neither face is in
 

1929
00:31:59,279 --> 00:32:01,110
the answer is well neither face is in
front because there's no cube

1930
00:32:01,110 --> 00:32:01,120
front because there's no cube
 

1931
00:32:01,120 --> 00:32:03,509
front because there's no cube
this is a flat piece of paper yeah so

1932
00:32:03,509 --> 00:32:03,519
this is a flat piece of paper yeah so
 

1933
00:32:03,519 --> 00:32:05,750
this is a flat piece of paper yeah so
when you look at the piece of paper you

1934
00:32:05,750 --> 00:32:05,760
when you look at the piece of paper you
 

1935
00:32:05,760 --> 00:32:08,310
when you look at the piece of paper you
perceptually create the cube

1936
00:32:08,310 --> 00:32:08,320
perceptually create the cube
 

1937
00:32:08,320 --> 00:32:11,110
perceptually create the cube
and when you look at it then you fix one

1938
00:32:11,110 --> 00:32:11,120
and when you look at it then you fix one
 

1939
00:32:11,120 --> 00:32:12,710
and when you look at it then you fix one
face to be in front and one face to the

1940
00:32:12,710 --> 00:32:12,720
face to be in front and one face to the
 

1941
00:32:12,720 --> 00:32:14,870
face to be in front and one face to the
other so that's what i mean when i say

1942
00:32:14,870 --> 00:32:14,880
other so that's what i mean when i say
 

1943
00:32:14,880 --> 00:32:16,870
other so that's what i mean when i say
it doesn't exist space time itself is

1944
00:32:16,870 --> 00:32:16,880
it doesn't exist space time itself is
 

1945
00:32:16,880 --> 00:32:20,070
it doesn't exist space time itself is
like the cube it's a data structure that

1946
00:32:20,070 --> 00:32:20,080
like the cube it's a data structure that
 

1947
00:32:20,080 --> 00:32:22,230
like the cube it's a data structure that
your sensory systems construct whatever

1948
00:32:22,230 --> 00:32:22,240
your sensory systems construct whatever
 

1949
00:32:22,240 --> 00:32:24,149
your sensory systems construct whatever
your sensory systems mean now because we

1950
00:32:24,149 --> 00:32:24,159
your sensory systems mean now because we
 

1951
00:32:24,159 --> 00:32:25,430
your sensory systems mean now because we
now have to

1952
00:32:25,430 --> 00:32:25,440
now have to
 

1953
00:32:25,440 --> 00:32:27,590
now have to
even not even take that for granted but

1954
00:32:27,590 --> 00:32:27,600
even not even take that for granted but
 

1955
00:32:27,600 --> 00:32:30,149
even not even take that for granted but
there are perceptions that you construct

1956
00:32:30,149 --> 00:32:30,159
there are perceptions that you construct
 

1957
00:32:30,159 --> 00:32:31,269
there are perceptions that you construct
on the fly

1958
00:32:31,269 --> 00:32:31,279
on the fly
 

1959
00:32:31,279 --> 00:32:33,190

and uh their data structures and the

1960
00:32:33,190 --> 00:32:33,200
and uh their data structures and the
 

1961
00:32:33,200 --> 00:32:34,389
and uh their data structures and the
computer sciences and you garbage

1962
00:32:34,389 --> 00:32:34,399
computer sciences and you garbage
 

1963
00:32:34,399 --> 00:32:35,750
computer sciences and you garbage
collect them when you don't need them so

1964
00:32:35,750 --> 00:32:35,760
collect them when you don't need them so
 

1965
00:32:35,760 --> 00:32:37,350
collect them when you don't need them so
you create them and garbage collect them

1966
00:32:37,350 --> 00:32:37,360
you create them and garbage collect them
 

1967
00:32:37,360 --> 00:32:40,789
you create them and garbage collect them
but is it possible that it's mapped well

1968
00:32:40,789 --> 00:32:40,799

way that we maybe don't yet understand
 

1983
00:32:55,679 --> 00:32:57,029
way that we maybe don't yet understand
but will

1984
00:32:57,029 --> 00:32:57,039
but will

00:32:58,559 --> 00:33:00,149
one day understand
what that mapping is but it maps

1988
00:33:00,149 --> 00:33:00,159
what that mapping is but it maps
 

1989
00:33:00,159 --> 00:33:03,110
what that mapping is but it maps
reliably it is tethered in that way well

1990
00:33:03,110 --> 00:33:03,120
reliably it is tethered in that way well
 

1991
00:33:03,120 --> 00:33:04,950
reliably it is tethered in that way well
yes and and so the new theories that the

1992
00:33:04,950 --> 00:33:04,960
yes and and so the new theories that the
 

1993
00:33:04,960 --> 00:33:06,950
yes and and so the new theories that the
physicists are finding beyond spacetime

1994
00:33:06,950 --> 00:33:06,960
physicists are finding beyond spacetime
 

1995
00:33:06,960 --> 00:33:08,549
physicists are finding beyond spacetime
have that kind of tethering so they're

1996
00:33:08,549 --> 00:33:08,559
have that kind of tethering so they're
 

1997
00:33:08,559 --> 00:33:10,549
have that kind of tethering so they're
they show precisely how you start with

1998
00:33:10,549 --> 00:33:10,559
they show precisely how you start with
 

1999
00:33:10,559 --> 00:33:13,509
they show precisely how you start with
an amplitude and how you project this

2000
00:33:13,509 --> 00:33:13,519
an amplitude and how you project this
 

2001
00:33:13,519 --> 00:33:16,149
an amplitude and how you project this
high dimensional structure into

2002
00:33:16,149 --> 00:33:16,159
high dimensional structure into
 

2003
00:33:16,159 --> 00:33:18,230
high dimensional structure into
the four dimensions of space time

2004
00:33:18,230 --> 00:33:18,240
the four dimensions of space time
 

2005
00:33:18,240 --> 00:33:21,190
the four dimensions of space time
so there's a precise procedure that that

2006
00:33:21,190 --> 00:33:21,200
so there's a precise procedure that that
 

2007
00:33:21,200 --> 00:33:22,870
so there's a precise procedure that that
relates the two and

2008
00:33:22,870 --> 00:33:22,880
relates the two and
 

2009
00:33:22,880 --> 00:33:23,830
relates the two and
they're doing the same thing with the

2010
00:33:23,830 --> 00:33:23,840
they're doing the same thing with the
 

2011
00:33:23,840 --> 00:33:27,110
they're doing the same thing with the
cosmological polytopes so so they're the

2012
00:33:27,110 --> 00:33:27,120
cosmological polytopes so so they're the
 

2013
00:33:27,120 --> 00:33:28,070
cosmological polytopes so so they're the
they're the ones that are making the

00:33:28,070 --> 00:33:28,080
they're the ones that are making the

00:33:33,029 --> 00:33:33,039
advances going beyond space time and
 

2019
00:33:33,039 --> 00:33:35,029
advances going beyond space time and
there they're they're tethering it right

2020

there they're they're tethering it right
 

2021

they say this is precisely the

one thing i'll say about

2028
00:33:43,590 --> 00:33:43,600
one thing i'll say about
 

2029
00:33:43,600 --> 00:33:45,509
one thing i'll say about
as a non-physicist what that i find

00:33:45,509 --> 00:33:45,519
as a non-physicist what that i find
 

2031
00:33:45,519 --> 00:33:47,590
as a non-physicist what that i find
interesting is that they're finding just

2032
00:33:47,590 --> 00:33:47,600
interesting is that they're finding just
 

2033
00:33:47,600 --> 00:33:49,669
interesting is that they're finding just
geometry but there's no notion of

right now they're just finding these

right now they're just finding these
 

2039

2045
00:33:59,039 --> 00:34:01,430
putting them down this is what they're

2131
00:35:28,320 --> 00:35:30,390
property as well and then you have you
combine these physical and conscious

2132
00:35:30,390 --> 00:35:30,400
combine these physical and conscious
 

2133
00:35:30,400 --> 00:35:32,069
combine these physical and conscious
properties to get more complicated ones

that particular assumption bother you

00:35:49,349 --> 00:35:49,359
that particular assumption bother you
 

2151
00:35:49,359 --> 00:35:53,510
that particular assumption bother you
the most so you bring up space time

2152
00:35:53,510 --> 00:35:53,520
the most so you bring up space time
 

2153
00:35:53,520 --> 00:35:55,910
the most so you bring up space time
i mean that's just one

2154
00:35:55,910 --> 00:35:55,920
i mean that's just one
 

2155
00:35:55,920 --> 00:35:58,069
i mean that's just one
useful interface we've used for a long

00:35:58,069 --> 00:35:58,079
useful interface we've used for a long

2159
00:35:59,119 --> 00:36:01,829

uh surely there's other interfaces is

2160
00:36:01,829 --> 00:36:01,839
uh surely there's other interfaces is
 

2161
00:36:01,839 --> 00:36:03,750
uh surely there's other interfaces is
space time just the

space time just the
 

2163
00:36:03,760 --> 00:36:05,349
space time just the
one of the big ones that you

2164
00:36:05,349 --> 00:36:05,359
one of the big ones that you
 

2165
00:36:05,359 --> 00:36:06,950
one of the big ones that you
to build up people's intuition about the

2166
00:36:06,950 --> 00:36:06,960
to build up people's intuition about the
 

2167
00:36:06,960 --> 00:36:08,710
to build up people's intuition about the
fact that they just do assume a lot of

2168
00:36:08,710 --> 00:36:08,720
fact that they just do assume a lot of
 

2169
00:36:08,720 --> 00:36:10,230
fact that they just do assume a lot of
things strongly

2170
00:36:10,230 --> 00:36:10,240
things strongly
 

2171
00:36:10,240 --> 00:36:12,790
things strongly
or or it is is it in fact the

2172
00:36:12,790 --> 00:36:12,800
or or it is is it in fact the
 

2173
00:36:12,800 --> 00:36:15,910
or or it is is it in fact the
fundamental flaw in the way we see the

2174
00:36:15,910 --> 00:36:15,920
fundamental flaw in the way we see the
 

2175
00:36:15,920 --> 00:36:17,349
fundamental flaw in the way we see the

2177
00:36:17,359 --> 00:36:19,109

well everything else that we think we

2178
00:36:19,109 --> 00:36:19,119
well everything else that we think we
 

2179
00:36:19,119 --> 00:36:20,470
well everything else that we think we
know

2180
00:36:20,470 --> 00:36:20,480
know
 

2181
00:36:20,480 --> 00:36:23,349
know
are things in space time

2182
00:36:23,349 --> 00:36:23,359
are things in space time
 

2183
00:36:23,359 --> 00:36:24,950
are things in space time
sure and so

2184
00:36:24,950 --> 00:36:24,960
sure and so
 

2185
00:36:24,960 --> 00:36:27,589
sure and so
if you when you say space time is doomed

2186
00:36:27,589 --> 00:36:27,599
if you when you say space time is doomed
 

2187
00:36:27,599 --> 00:36:30,470
if you when you say space time is doomed
this is a shot to the heart yeah

2209
00:36:51,839 --> 00:36:53,910
scales in space-time
we will find more and more fundamental

2210
00:36:53,910 --> 00:36:53,920
we will find more and more fundamental
 

2211
00:36:53,920 --> 00:36:54,950
we will find more and more fundamental
laws

2212

laws
 

2213
00:36:54,960 --> 00:36:57,270

and it's been very useful for

2214
00:36:57,270 --> 00:36:57,280
and it's been very useful for
 

2215
00:36:57,280 --> 00:36:59,270
and it's been very useful for
for the space and time for centuries

2216
00:36:59,270 --> 00:36:59,280
for the space and time for centuries

that's over

that's over
reductionism is in fact dead

some of the physicists that you

2236
00:37:17,750 --> 00:37:17,760
some of the physicists that you
 

2237
00:37:17,760 --> 00:37:19,349
some of the physicists that you
mentioned that are trying to think

00:37:19,349 --> 00:37:19,359
mentioned that are trying to think
 

2239
00:37:19,359 --> 00:37:20,829
mentioned that are trying to think
trying to let go of the assumption of

trying to let go of the assumption of
 

2241
00:37:20,839 --> 00:37:23,109
trying to let go of the assumption of
space-time looking beyond isn't that

2242
00:37:23,109 --> 00:37:23,119
space-time looking beyond isn't that
 

2243
00:37:23,119 --> 00:37:25,270
space-time looking beyond isn't that
still trying to come up with a simple

2244
00:37:25,270 --> 00:37:25,280
still trying to come up with a simple
 

2245
00:37:25,280 --> 00:37:27,190
still trying to come up with a simple
model that explains this whole thing

2246
00:37:27,190 --> 00:37:27,200
model that explains this whole thing
 

2247
00:37:27,200 --> 00:37:29,190
model that explains this whole thing
isn't it still reducing

2248
00:37:29,190 --> 00:37:29,200
isn't it still reducing
 

2249
00:37:29,200 --> 00:37:30,470
isn't it still reducing
it's a wonderful question because it

2250
00:37:30,470 --> 00:37:30,480
it's a wonderful question because it
 

2251
00:37:30,480 --> 00:37:32,470
it's a wonderful question because it
really helps to clarify two different

00:37:32,470 --> 00:37:32,480
really helps to clarify two different
 

2253
00:37:32,480 --> 00:37:34,630
really helps to clarify two different
notions which is scientific explanation

2254
00:37:34,630 --> 00:37:34,640
notions which is scientific explanation
 

2255
00:37:34,640 --> 00:37:36,390
notions which is scientific explanation
on the one hand

2256
00:37:36,390 --> 00:37:36,400
on the one hand
 

2257
00:37:36,400 --> 00:37:38,230
on the one hand
and a particular kind of scientific

2258
00:37:38,230 --> 00:37:38,240
and a particular kind of scientific
 

2259
00:37:38,240 --> 00:37:40,069
and a particular kind of scientific
explanation on the other which is the

2260
00:37:40,069 --> 00:37:40,079
explanation on the other which is the
 

2261
00:37:40,079 --> 00:37:41,589
explanation on the other which is the
reductionist so the reductionist

2262
00:37:41,589 --> 00:37:41,599
reductionist so the reductionist
 

2263
00:37:41,599 --> 00:37:44,150
reductionist so the reductionist
explanation is saying i will start with

2264
00:37:44,150 --> 00:37:44,160
explanation is saying i will start with
 

2265
00:37:44,160 --> 00:37:45,349
explanation is saying i will start with
with

2266
00:37:45,349 --> 00:37:45,359
with
 

2267
00:37:45,359 --> 00:37:47,589
with
things that are smaller in space-time

2268
00:37:47,589 --> 00:37:47,599
things that are smaller in space-time
 

2269
00:37:47,599 --> 00:37:49,430
things that are smaller in space-time
and therefore more fundamental where the

2270
00:37:49,430 --> 00:37:49,440
and therefore more fundamental where the
 

2271
00:37:49,440 --> 00:37:50,950
and therefore more fundamental where the
laws are more fundamental

2272
00:37:50,950 --> 00:37:50,960
laws are more fundamental
 

2273
00:37:50,960 --> 00:37:52,310
laws are more fundamental
so we go

2274
00:37:52,310 --> 00:37:52,320
so we go
 

2275
00:37:52,320 --> 00:37:54,790
so we go
uh to just smaller and smaller scales

2276
00:37:54,790 --> 00:37:54,800
uh to just smaller and smaller scales
 

2277
00:37:54,800 --> 00:37:56,069
uh to just smaller and smaller scales
whereas with

2278
00:37:56,069 --> 00:37:56,079
whereas with
 

2279
00:37:56,079 --> 00:37:58,470
whereas with
in science more generally we just say

2280
00:37:58,470 --> 00:37:58,480
in science more generally we just say
 

2281
00:37:58,480 --> 00:37:59,910
in science more generally we just say
like when einstein did the special

in uniform motion um and that the laws

2296
00:38:12,550 --> 00:38:12,560
in uniform motion um and that the laws
 

2297
00:38:12,560 --> 00:38:15,190
in uniform motion um and that the laws
of physics so i feel for for uniform

2298
00:38:15,190 --> 00:38:15,200
of physics so i feel for for uniform
 

2299
00:38:15,200 --> 00:38:16,630
of physics so i feel for for uniform
motion are are those

2300
00:38:16,630 --> 00:38:16,640
motion are are those
 

2301
00:38:16,640 --> 00:38:18,470
motion are are those
that's not a reductionist that those are

2302
00:38:18,470 --> 00:38:18,480
that's not a reductionist that those are
 

2303
00:38:18,480 --> 00:38:20,150
that's not a reductionist that those are
saying grant me these assumptions i can

2304
00:38:20,150 --> 00:38:20,160
saying grant me these assumptions i can
 

2305
00:38:20,160 --> 00:38:21,910
saying grant me these assumptions i can
build this entire

2306
00:38:21,910 --> 00:38:21,920
build this entire
 

2307
00:38:21,920 --> 00:38:23,430
build this entire
concept of space time out of it it's not

2308
00:38:23,430 --> 00:38:23,440
concept of space time out of it it's not
 

2309
00:38:23,440 --> 00:38:25,030
concept of space time out of it it's not
a reductionist thing you're not going to

2310
00:38:25,030 --> 00:38:25,040
a reductionist thing you're not going to
 

2311
00:38:25,040 --> 00:38:27,670
a reductionist thing you're not going to
smaller and smaller scales of space

2312
00:38:27,670 --> 00:38:27,680
smaller and smaller scales of space
 

2313
00:38:27,680 --> 00:38:29,349
smaller and smaller scales of space
you're you're coming up with these deep

2314
00:38:29,349 --> 00:38:29,359
you're you're coming up with these deep
 

2315
00:38:29,359 --> 00:38:31,270
you're you're coming up with these deep
deep principles same thing with this

2316
00:38:31,270 --> 00:38:31,280
deep principles same thing with this
 

2317
00:38:31,280 --> 00:38:32,710
deep principles same thing with this
theory of gravity

2318
00:38:32,710 --> 00:38:32,720
theory of gravity
 

2319
00:38:32,720 --> 00:38:35,109
theory of gravity
right it's the falling elevator idea

2320
00:38:35,109 --> 00:38:35,119
right it's the falling elevator idea
 

2321
00:38:35,119 --> 00:38:37,030
right it's the falling elevator idea
right so this is not a reductionist kind

2322
00:38:37,030 --> 00:38:37,040
right so this is not a reductionist kind
 

2323
00:38:37,040 --> 00:38:39,030
right so this is not a reductionist kind
of thing it's it's it's it's it's

2324
00:38:39,030 --> 00:38:39,040
of thing it's it's it's it's it's
 

2325
00:38:39,040 --> 00:38:41,589
of thing it's it's it's it's it's
something different so simplification

2326
00:38:41,589 --> 00:38:41,599
something different so simplification
 

2327
00:38:41,599 --> 00:38:45,430
something different so simplification
is a bigger thing than just reductionism

2328
00:38:45,430 --> 00:38:45,440
is a bigger thing than just reductionism
 

2329
00:38:45,440 --> 00:38:47,109
is a bigger thing than just reductionism
reductionism has been a particularly

2330
00:38:47,109 --> 00:38:47,119
reductionism has been a particularly
 

2331
00:38:47,119 --> 00:38:49,430
reductionism has been a particularly
useful kind of scientific explanation

2332
00:38:49,430 --> 00:38:49,440
useful kind of scientific explanation
 

2333
00:38:49,440 --> 00:38:51,349
useful kind of scientific explanation
for example in thermodynamics

2334
00:38:51,349 --> 00:38:51,359
for example in thermodynamics
 

2335
00:38:51,359 --> 00:38:52,950
for example in thermodynamics
right where the notion that we have of

2336
00:38:52,950 --> 00:38:52,960
right where the notion that we have of
 

2337
00:38:52,960 --> 00:38:54,870
right where the notion that we have of
heat some macroscopic thing like

2338
00:38:54,870 --> 00:38:54,880
heat some macroscopic thing like
 

2339
00:38:54,880 --> 00:38:56,550
heat some macroscopic thing like
temperature and heat

2340
00:38:56,550 --> 00:38:56,560
temperature and heat
 

2341
00:38:56,560 --> 00:38:58,150
temperature and heat
it turns out that neil boltzmann and

2342
00:38:58,150 --> 00:38:58,160
it turns out that neil boltzmann and
 

2343
00:38:58,160 --> 00:38:58,950
it turns out that neil boltzmann and
others

discover well hey you know if we go to
 

2347
00:39:00,640 --> 00:39:02,310
discover well hey you know if we go to
smaller and smaller scales we find these

2348
00:39:02,310 --> 00:39:02,320
smaller and smaller scales we find these
 

2349
00:39:02,320 --> 00:39:04,630
smaller and smaller scales we find these
things called molecules or atoms and if

2350
00:39:04,630 --> 00:39:04,640
things called molecules or atoms and if
 

2351
00:39:04,640 --> 00:39:06,310
things called molecules or atoms and if
we think of them as bouncing around

2352
00:39:06,310 --> 00:39:06,320
we think of them as bouncing around
 

2353
00:39:06,320 --> 00:39:09,910
we think of them as bouncing around
having some kind of energy then um what

2354
00:39:09,910 --> 00:39:09,920
having some kind of energy then um what
 

2355
00:39:09,920 --> 00:39:12,310
having some kind of energy then um what
we call heat is is a is really can be

2356
00:39:12,310 --> 00:39:12,320
we call heat is is a is really can be
 

2357
00:39:12,320 --> 00:39:14,550
we call heat is is a is really can be
reduced to to that

2358
00:39:14,550 --> 00:39:14,560
reduced to to that
 

2359
00:39:14,560 --> 00:39:17,349
reduced to to that
and and so that's a particularly useful

2360
00:39:17,349 --> 00:39:17,359
and and so that's a particularly useful
 

2361
00:39:17,359 --> 00:39:18,310
and and so that's a particularly useful
kind of

2362
00:39:18,310 --> 00:39:18,320
kind of
 

2363
00:39:18,320 --> 00:39:20,470
kind of
reduction is a useful kind of scientific

2364
00:39:20,470 --> 00:39:20,480
reduction is a useful kind of scientific
 

2365
00:39:20,480 --> 00:39:22,870
reduction is a useful kind of scientific
explanation that works within a range of

00:40:02,230 --> 00:40:02,240
excitedly exploring um
 

2403
00:40:02,240 --> 00:40:04,390
excitedly exploring um
a proposal for a data structure that

2404
00:40:04,390 --> 00:40:04,400
a proposal for a data structure that
 

2405
00:40:04,400 --> 00:40:05,750
a proposal for a data structure that
could be

2406
00:40:05,750 --> 00:40:05,760
could be
 

2407
00:40:05,760 --> 00:40:07,510
could be
um the numbers that would make you a

2408
00:40:07,510 --> 00:40:07,520
um the numbers that would make you a
 

2409
00:40:07,520 --> 00:40:09,109
um the numbers that would make you a
little bit happier in terms of scale

2410
00:40:09,109 --> 00:40:09,119
little bit happier in terms of scale
 

2411
00:40:09,119 --> 00:40:12,790
little bit happier in terms of scale
because they're very very very very tiny

2412
00:40:12,790 --> 00:40:12,800
because they're very very very very tiny
 

2413
00:40:12,800 --> 00:40:15,270
because they're very very very very tiny
do you like this space of exploration

2414
00:40:15,270 --> 00:40:15,280
do you like this space of exploration
 

2415
00:40:15,280 --> 00:40:17,589
do you like this space of exploration
i'm really thinking letting go of space

2416
00:40:17,589 --> 00:40:17,599
i'm really thinking letting go of space
 

2417
00:40:17,599 --> 00:40:19,750
i'm really thinking letting go of space
time letting go of everything and trying

2418
00:40:19,750 --> 00:40:19,760
time letting go of everything and trying
 

2419
00:40:19,760 --> 00:40:21,510
time letting go of everything and trying
to think what kind of data structures

2420
00:40:21,510 --> 00:40:21,520
to think what kind of data structures
 

2421
00:40:21,520 --> 00:40:23,589
to think what kind of data structures
could be underneath this whole mess

2422
00:40:23,589 --> 00:40:23,599
could be underneath this whole mess
 

2423
00:40:23,599 --> 00:40:25,349
could be underneath this whole mess
that's right so if they're thinking

2424
00:40:25,349 --> 00:40:25,359
that's right so if they're thinking
 

2425
00:40:25,359 --> 00:40:27,589
that's right so if they're thinking
about these as outside of space-time

2426
00:40:27,589 --> 00:40:27,599
about these as outside of space-time
 

2427
00:40:27,599 --> 00:40:28,950
about these as outside of space-time
then that's that's what we have to do

2428
00:40:28,950 --> 00:40:28,960
then that's that's what we have to do
 

2429
00:40:28,960 --> 00:40:30,069
then that's that's what we have to do
that's what our best theories are

2430
00:40:30,069 --> 00:40:30,079
that's what our best theories are
 

2431
00:40:30,079 --> 00:40:31,670
that's what our best theories are
telling us you now have to think outside

2432
00:40:31,670 --> 00:40:31,680
telling us you now have to think outside
 

2433
00:40:31,680 --> 00:40:33,829
telling us you now have to think outside
of space-time now of course

2434
00:40:33,829 --> 00:40:33,839
of space-time now of course
 

2435
00:40:33,839 --> 00:40:35,270
of space-time now of course
i should

2436
00:40:35,270 --> 00:40:35,280
i should
 

2437
00:40:35,280 --> 00:40:36,550
i should
back up and say

2438
00:40:36,550 --> 00:40:36,560
back up and say
 

2439
00:40:36,560 --> 00:40:38,630
back up and say
we know that einstein

2440
00:40:38,630 --> 00:40:38,640
we know that einstein
 

2441
00:40:38,640 --> 00:40:40,630
we know that einstein
surpassed newton right but that doesn't

2442
00:40:40,630 --> 00:40:40,640
surpassed newton right but that doesn't
 

2443
00:40:40,640 --> 00:40:42,470
surpassed newton right but that doesn't
mean that there's not good work to do a

2444
00:40:42,470 --> 00:40:42,480
mean that there's not good work to do a
 

2445
00:40:42,480 --> 00:40:43,829
mean that there's not good work to do a
newton there's all sorts of newtonian

2446
00:40:43,829 --> 00:40:43,839
newton there's all sorts of newtonian
 

2447
00:40:43,839 --> 00:40:45,829
newton there's all sorts of newtonian
physics that takes us to the moon and so

2448
00:40:45,829 --> 00:40:45,839
physics that takes us to the moon and so
 

2449
00:40:45,839 --> 00:40:47,109
physics that takes us to the moon and so
forth and there's lots of good problems

2450
00:40:47,109 --> 00:40:47,119
forth and there's lots of good problems
 

2451
00:40:47,119 --> 00:40:49,190
forth and there's lots of good problems

space-time we'll we'll still it's not
 

2457
00:40:52,319 --> 00:40:53,670
space-time we'll we'll still it's not
like we're going to stop using space

2458
00:40:53,670 --> 00:40:53,680
like we're going to stop using space
 

2459
00:40:53,680 --> 00:40:55,510
like we're going to stop using space
time we'll continue to do all sorts of

00:40:57,589 --> 00:40:57,599
good work there but for for those

scientists who are really looking to
 

2465
00:41:01,520 --> 00:41:03,990
scientists who are really looking to
go deeper to actually find the next you

2466
00:41:03,990 --> 00:41:04,000
go deeper to actually find the next you
 

2467
00:41:04,000 --> 00:41:05,430
go deeper to actually find the next you
know just like what einstein did to

2468
00:41:05,430 --> 00:41:05,440
know just like what einstein did to
 

2469
00:41:05,440 --> 00:41:06,950
know just like what einstein did to
newton what what are we going to do to

2470
00:41:06,950 --> 00:41:06,960
newton what what are we going to do to
 

2471
00:41:06,960 --> 00:41:08,870
newton what what are we going to do to
einstein how do we get beyond einstein

2472
00:41:08,870 --> 00:41:08,880
einstein how do we get beyond einstein
 

2473
00:41:08,880 --> 00:41:10,790
einstein how do we get beyond einstein
and quantum theory to something deeper

2474
00:41:10,790 --> 00:41:10,800
and quantum theory to something deeper
 

2475
00:41:10,800 --> 00:41:13,510
and quantum theory to something deeper
then we have to actually let go and and

2476
00:41:13,510 --> 00:41:13,520
then we have to actually let go and and
 

2477
00:41:13,520 --> 00:41:15,349
then we have to actually let go and and
if we're going to do like this

2478
00:41:15,349 --> 00:41:15,359
if we're going to do like this
 

2479
00:41:15,359 --> 00:41:18,630
if we're going to do like this
a automata kind of approach

2480
00:41:18,630 --> 00:41:18,640
a automata kind of approach
 

2481
00:41:18,640 --> 00:41:20,470
a automata kind of approach
it's critical that it's not automata in

2482
00:41:20,470 --> 00:41:20,480
it's critical that it's not automata in
 

2483
00:41:20,480 --> 00:41:22,470
it's critical that it's not automata in
space-time it's automata prior to

2484
00:41:22,470 --> 00:41:22,480
space-time it's automata prior to
 

2485
00:41:22,480 --> 00:41:24,309
space-time it's automata prior to
space-time from which we're going to

2486
00:41:24,309 --> 00:41:24,319
space-time from which we're going to
 

2487
00:41:24,319 --> 00:41:25,910
space-time from which we're going to
show how space-time emerges if you're

2488
00:41:25,910 --> 00:41:25,920
show how space-time emerges if you're
 

2489
00:41:25,920 --> 00:41:28,470
show how space-time emerges if you're
doing automotive within space-time well

2490
00:41:28,470 --> 00:41:28,480
doing automotive within space-time well
 

2491
00:41:28,480 --> 00:41:29,990
doing automotive within space-time well
that might be a fun model but it's not

2492
00:41:29,990 --> 00:41:30,000
that might be a fun model but it's not
 

2493
00:41:30,000 --> 00:41:33,349
that might be a fun model but it's not
the radical new step that we need

2494
00:41:33,349 --> 00:41:33,359
the radical new step that we need
 

2495
00:41:33,359 --> 00:41:35,349
the radical new step that we need
yeah so the space time emerges from that

2496
00:41:35,349 --> 00:41:35,359
yeah so the space time emerges from that
 

2497
00:41:35,359 --> 00:41:37,349
yeah so the space time emerges from that
whatever system yeah like you're saying

2498
00:41:37,349 --> 00:41:37,359
whatever system yeah like you're saying

00:41:37,359 --> 00:41:38,069

it's

00:41:38,069 --> 00:41:38,079
it's
 

2501
00:41:38,079 --> 00:41:40,069
it's
it's a dynamical system do we even have

2502
00:41:40,069 --> 00:41:40,079
it's a dynamical system do we even have
 

2503
00:41:40,079 --> 00:41:42,309
it's a dynamical system do we even have
an understanding what dynamical means

2504
00:41:42,309 --> 00:41:42,319
an understanding what dynamical means
 

2505
00:41:42,319 --> 00:41:45,349
an understanding what dynamical means
when we go beyond

2506
00:41:45,349 --> 00:41:45,359
when we go beyond
 

2507
00:41:45,359 --> 00:41:47,829
when we go beyond
when we start to think about dynamics

2508
00:41:47,829 --> 00:41:47,839
when we start to think about dynamics
 

2509
00:41:47,839 --> 00:41:50,230
when we start to think about dynamics
that could mean a lot of things

2510
00:41:50,230 --> 00:41:50,240
that could mean a lot of things
 

2511
00:41:50,240 --> 00:41:52,150
that could mean a lot of things
even causality could mean a lot of

00:41:52,150 --> 00:41:52,160
even causality could mean a lot of
 

2513
00:41:52,160 --> 00:41:54,150
even causality could mean a lot of
things if if we

like what how much do we really know is

2520
00:42:00,550 --> 00:42:00,560
like what how much do we really know is
 

2521
00:42:00,560 --> 00:42:01,750
like what how much do we really know is
an interesting question because you

2522
00:42:01,750 --> 00:42:01,760
an interesting question because you
 

2523
00:42:01,760 --> 00:42:03,270
an interesting question because you
brought up neurons i got to ask you and

2524
00:42:03,270 --> 00:42:03,280
brought up neurons i got to ask you and

understand
 

2613
00:43:30,400 --> 00:43:31,190
understand
the

2614
00:43:31,190 --> 00:43:31,200
the
 

2615
00:43:31,200 --> 00:43:32,950
the
transistors enough to be able to build a

2616
00:43:32,950 --> 00:43:32,960
transistors enough to be able to build a
 

2617
00:43:32,960 --> 00:43:36,630
transistors enough to be able to build a
computer so one one um

2618
00:43:36,630 --> 00:43:36,640
computer so one one um
 

2619
00:43:36,640 --> 00:43:38,230
computer so one one um
one thing about understanding is you can

2620
00:43:38,230 --> 00:43:38,240
one thing about understanding is you can
 

2621
00:43:38,240 --> 00:43:40,550
one thing about understanding is you can
understand for fun

2622
00:43:40,550 --> 00:43:40,560
understand for fun
 

2623
00:43:40,560 --> 00:43:41,990
understand for fun
the other one is

2624
00:43:41,990 --> 00:43:42,000
the other one is
 

2625
00:43:42,000 --> 00:43:44,550
the other one is
to understand so you could build

2626
00:43:44,550 --> 00:43:44,560
to understand so you could build
 

2627
00:43:44,560 --> 00:43:45,750
to understand so you could build
things

2628
00:43:45,750 --> 00:43:45,760
things
 

2629
00:43:45,760 --> 00:43:47,190
things
and and that's when you really have to

2630
00:43:47,190 --> 00:43:47,200
and and that's when you really have to
 

2631
00:43:47,200 --> 00:43:48,710
and and that's when you really have to
understand

2632
00:43:48,710 --> 00:43:48,720
understand
 

2633
00:43:48,720 --> 00:43:51,910
understand
uh exactly in fact what got me into the

2634
00:43:51,910 --> 00:43:51,920
uh exactly in fact what got me into the
 

2635
00:43:51,920 --> 00:43:53,109
uh exactly in fact what got me into the
field that i

2636
00:43:53,109 --> 00:43:53,119
field that i
 

2637
00:43:53,119 --> 00:43:56,630
field that i
at mit was um worked by david marr

2638
00:43:56,630 --> 00:43:56,640
at mit was um worked by david marr
 

2639
00:43:56,640 --> 00:43:58,710
at mit was um worked by david marr
on this very topic so david maher

2640
00:43:58,710 --> 00:43:58,720
on this very topic so david maher
 

2641
00:43:58,720 --> 00:44:00,309
on this very topic so david maher
was a professor at mit but he'd done his

2642
00:44:00,309 --> 00:44:00,319
was a professor at mit but he'd done his
 

2643
00:44:00,319 --> 00:44:03,190
was a professor at mit but he'd done his
phd in neuroscience studying just the

2644
00:44:03,190 --> 00:44:03,200
phd in neuroscience studying just the
 

2645
00:44:03,200 --> 00:44:05,510
phd in neuroscience studying just the
architectures of the brain but he

2646
00:44:05,510 --> 00:44:05,520
architectures of the brain but he
 

2647
00:44:05,520 --> 00:44:07,829
architectures of the brain but he
realized that his his work it was on the

2648
00:44:07,829 --> 00:44:07,839
realized that his his work it was on the
 

2649
00:44:07,839 --> 00:44:09,910
realized that his his work it was on the
cerebellum um

2650
00:44:09,910 --> 00:44:09,920
cerebellum um
 

2651
00:44:09,920 --> 00:44:12,309
cerebellum um
he he realized that his work

2652
00:44:12,309 --> 00:44:12,319
he he realized that his work
 

2653
00:44:12,319 --> 00:44:15,190
he he realized that his work
as as rigorous as it was

2654
00:44:15,190 --> 00:44:15,200
as as rigorous as it was
 

2655
00:44:15,200 --> 00:44:16,950
as as rigorous as it was
left him unsatisfied because he didn't

2656
00:44:16,950 --> 00:44:16,960
left him unsatisfied because he didn't
 

2657
00:44:16,960 --> 00:44:18,950
left him unsatisfied because he didn't
know what the cerebellum was for

2658
00:44:18,950 --> 00:44:18,960
know what the cerebellum was for
 

2659
00:44:18,960 --> 00:44:21,030
know what the cerebellum was for
yeah and and and why it had that

2660
00:44:21,030 --> 00:44:21,040
yeah and and and why it had that
 

2661
00:44:21,040 --> 00:44:22,630
yeah and and and why it had that
architecture and so he

2662
00:44:22,630 --> 00:44:22,640
architecture and so he
 

2663
00:44:22,640 --> 00:44:24,950
architecture and so he
he went to mit and he was in the ai lab

2664
00:44:24,950 --> 00:44:24,960
he went to mit and he was in the ai lab
 

2665
00:44:24,960 --> 00:44:27,190
he went to mit and he was in the ai lab
there and and uh

2666
00:44:27,190 --> 00:44:27,200
there and and uh
 

2667
00:44:27,200 --> 00:44:29,510
there and and uh
he said he had this three-level approach

2668
00:44:29,510 --> 00:44:29,520
he said he had this three-level approach
 

2669
00:44:29,520 --> 00:44:31,270
he said he had this three-level approach
that really grabbed my attention so i

2670
00:44:31,270 --> 00:44:31,280
that really grabbed my attention so i
 

2671
00:44:31,280 --> 00:44:32,790
that really grabbed my attention so i
when i was an undergrad at ucla i read

2672
00:44:32,790 --> 00:44:32,800
when i was an undergrad at ucla i read
 

2673
00:44:32,800 --> 00:44:34,630
when i was an undergrad at ucla i read
one of his papers in a class and said

2674
00:44:34,630 --> 00:44:34,640
one of his papers in a class and said
 

2675
00:44:34,640 --> 00:44:35,829
one of his papers in a class and said
who is this guy because he said you have

2676
00:44:35,829 --> 00:44:35,839
who is this guy because he said you have
 

2677
00:44:35,839 --> 00:44:37,670
who is this guy because he said you have
to have a computational theory what is

2678
00:44:37,670 --> 00:44:37,680
to have a computational theory what is
 

2679
00:44:37,680 --> 00:44:40,230
to have a computational theory what is
being computed and why

2680
00:44:40,230 --> 00:44:40,240
being computed and why
 

2681
00:44:40,240 --> 00:44:42,230
being computed and why
an algorithm how is it being computed

2682
00:44:42,230 --> 00:44:42,240
an algorithm how is it being computed
 

2683
00:44:42,240 --> 00:44:43,910
an algorithm how is it being computed
what what are the percep

2684
00:44:43,910 --> 00:44:43,920
what what are the percep
 

2685
00:44:43,920 --> 00:44:45,990
what what are the percep
algorithms and then the hardware how

2686
00:44:45,990 --> 00:44:46,000
algorithms and then the hardware how
 

2687
00:44:46,000 --> 00:44:47,670
algorithms and then the hardware how
does it get instantiated in the hardware

2688
00:44:47,670 --> 00:44:47,680
does it get instantiated in the hardware
 

2689
00:44:47,680 --> 00:44:49,349
does it get instantiated in the hardware
and so to really do

2690
00:44:49,349 --> 00:44:49,359
and so to really do
 

2691
00:44:49,359 --> 00:44:51,430
and so to really do
he argued we needed to have

2692
00:44:51,430 --> 00:44:51,440
he argued we needed to have
 

2693
00:44:51,440 --> 00:44:53,349
he argued we needed to have
understanding of all those levels and i

2694
00:44:53,349 --> 00:44:53,359
understanding of all those levels and i
 

2695
00:44:53,359 --> 00:44:54,790
understanding of all those levels and i
that really got me i loved the

2696
00:44:54,790 --> 00:44:54,800
that really got me i loved the
 

2697
00:44:54,800 --> 00:44:56,710
that really got me i loved the
neuroscience but i realized this guy was

2698
00:44:56,710 --> 00:44:56,720
neuroscience but i realized this guy was
 

2699
00:44:56,720 --> 00:44:58,630
neuroscience but i realized this guy was
saying if you can't build it you don't

2700
00:44:58,630 --> 00:44:58,640
saying if you can't build it you don't
 

2701
00:44:58,640 --> 00:45:00,390
saying if you can't build it you don't
understand it effectively and so that's

2702
00:45:00,390 --> 00:45:00,400
understand it effectively and so that's
 

2703
00:45:00,400 --> 00:45:03,589
understand it effectively and so that's
why i went to mit and i had the pleasure

2704
00:45:03,589 --> 00:45:03,599
why i went to mit and i had the pleasure
 

2705
00:45:03,599 --> 00:45:05,990
why i went to mit and i had the pleasure
of working with david until he died as

2706
00:45:05,990 --> 00:45:06,000
of working with david until he died as
 

2707
00:45:06,000 --> 00:45:09,109
of working with david until he died as
just a year and a half later

2708
00:45:09,109 --> 00:45:09,119
just a year and a half later
 

2709
00:45:09,119 --> 00:45:11,109
just a year and a half later
so there was there's been that idea that

2710
00:45:11,109 --> 00:45:11,119
so there was there's been that idea that
 

2711
00:45:11,119 --> 00:45:13,270
so there was there's been that idea that
you know with neuroscience we we have to

2712
00:45:13,270 --> 00:45:13,280
you know with neuroscience we we have to
 

2713
00:45:13,280 --> 00:45:15,829
you know with neuroscience we we have to
have in some sense a top-down model of

2714
00:45:15,829 --> 00:45:15,839
have in some sense a top-down model of
 

2715
00:45:15,839 --> 00:45:16,950
have in some sense a top-down model of
what what

2716
00:45:16,950 --> 00:45:16,960
what what
 

2717
00:45:16,960 --> 00:45:19,109
what what
what's being computed and why that we

2718
00:45:19,109 --> 00:45:19,119
what's being computed and why that we
 

2719
00:45:19,119 --> 00:45:20,470
what's being computed and why that we
would then go after and same thing with

2720
00:45:20,470 --> 00:45:20,480
would then go after and same thing with
 

2721
00:45:20,480 --> 00:45:22,550
would then go after and same thing with
the you know trying to reverse engineer

2722
00:45:22,550 --> 00:45:22,560
the you know trying to reverse engineer
 

2723
00:45:22,560 --> 00:45:24,470
the you know trying to reverse engineer
you know a computing system like your

2724
00:45:24,470 --> 00:45:24,480
you know a computing system like your
 

2725
00:45:24,480 --> 00:45:25,349
you know a computing system like your
laptop

2726
00:45:25,349 --> 00:45:25,359
laptop
 

2727
00:45:25,359 --> 00:45:26,870
laptop
we really would we really need to

2728
00:45:26,870 --> 00:45:26,880
we really would we really need to
 

2729
00:45:26,880 --> 00:45:28,550
we really would we really need to
understand what the user interface is

2730
00:45:28,550 --> 00:45:28,560
understand what the user interface is
 

2731
00:45:28,560 --> 00:45:31,190
understand what the user interface is
about and why we have what are

2732
00:45:31,190 --> 00:45:31,200
about and why we have what are
 

2733
00:45:31,200 --> 00:45:32,550
about and why we have what are
keys on the

2734
00:45:32,550 --> 00:45:32,560
keys on the
 

2735
00:45:32,560 --> 00:45:34,470
keys on the
keyboard for and so forth you need to

2736
00:45:34,470 --> 00:45:34,480
keyboard for and so forth you need to
 

2737
00:45:34,480 --> 00:45:35,990
keyboard for and so forth you need to
know why

2738
00:45:35,990 --> 00:45:36,000
know why
 

2739
00:45:36,000 --> 00:45:37,990
know why
to really understand all the circuitry

2740
00:45:37,990 --> 00:45:38,000
to really understand all the circuitry
 

2741
00:45:38,000 --> 00:45:40,230
to really understand all the circuitry
and what it's what it's for

2742
00:45:40,230 --> 00:45:40,240
and what it's what it's for
 

2743
00:45:40,240 --> 00:45:42,870
and what it's what it's for
now

2744
00:45:42,870 --> 00:45:42,880

 

2745
00:45:42,880 --> 00:45:44,950

we don't the evolution of natural

2746
00:45:44,950 --> 00:45:44,960
we don't the evolution of natural
 

2747
00:45:44,960 --> 00:45:46,470
we don't the evolution of natural
selection

2748
00:45:46,470 --> 00:45:46,480
selection
 

2749
00:45:46,480 --> 00:45:50,470
selection
does not tell us the deeper question

2750
00:45:50,470 --> 00:45:50,480
does not tell us the deeper question

is is just
an adaptive fiction

an adaptive fiction
 

2771
00:46:12,000 --> 00:46:13,910
an adaptive fiction
so just to linger on this fascinating

2772
00:46:13,910 --> 00:46:13,920
so just to linger on this fascinating
 

2773
00:46:13,920 --> 00:46:15,270
so just to linger on this fascinating
bold question

2774
00:46:15,270 --> 00:46:15,280
bold question
 

2775
00:46:15,280 --> 00:46:17,030
bold question
that shakes you out of

2776
00:46:17,030 --> 00:46:17,040
that shakes you out of
 

2777
00:46:17,040 --> 00:46:18,870
that shakes you out of
your dream state

2778
00:46:18,870 --> 00:46:18,880
your dream state
 

2779
00:46:18,880 --> 00:46:21,750
your dream state
does this fiction still help you in

2780
00:46:21,750 --> 00:46:21,760
does this fiction still help you in
 

2781
00:46:21,760 --> 00:46:24,790
does this fiction still help you in
building intuitions as literary fiction

2782
00:46:24,790 --> 00:46:24,800
building intuitions as literary fiction
 

2783
00:46:24,800 --> 00:46:25,750
building intuitions as literary fiction
does

2784
00:46:25,750 --> 00:46:25,760
does
 

2785
00:46:25,760 --> 00:46:27,670
does
about reality

2786
00:46:27,670 --> 00:46:27,680
about reality
 

2787
00:46:27,680 --> 00:46:30,790
about reality
the reason we read literary fiction

2788
00:46:30,790 --> 00:46:30,800
the reason we read literary fiction
 

2789
00:46:30,800 --> 00:46:33,270
the reason we read literary fiction
uh is it helps us

2790
00:46:33,270 --> 00:46:33,280
uh is it helps us
 

2791
00:46:33,280 --> 00:46:36,390
uh is it helps us
build intuitions and understanding in

2792
00:46:36,390 --> 00:46:36,400
build intuitions and understanding in
 

2793
00:46:36,400 --> 00:46:38,550
build intuitions and understanding in
indirect ways sneak up to the difficult

2794
00:46:38,550 --> 00:46:38,560
indirect ways sneak up to the difficult
 

2795
00:46:38,560 --> 00:46:41,829
indirect ways sneak up to the difficult
questions of human nature great fiction

2796
00:46:41,829 --> 00:46:41,839
questions of human nature great fiction
 

2797
00:46:41,839 --> 00:46:44,630
questions of human nature great fiction
same with this observed reality

2798
00:46:44,630 --> 00:46:44,640
same with this observed reality
 

2799
00:46:44,640 --> 00:46:45,910
same with this observed reality
um

2800
00:46:45,910 --> 00:46:45,920
um
 

2801
00:46:45,920 --> 00:46:48,069
um
does this interface that we get this

2802
00:46:48,069 --> 00:46:48,079
does this interface that we get this
 

2803
00:46:48,079 --> 00:46:49,670
does this interface that we get this
fictional interface help us build

2804
00:46:49,670 --> 00:46:49,680
fictional interface help us build
 

2805
00:46:49,680 --> 00:46:52,630
fictional interface help us build
intuition about deeper truths

2806
00:46:52,630 --> 00:46:52,640
intuition about deeper truths
 

2807
00:46:52,640 --> 00:46:54,870
intuition about deeper truths
of how this whole mess works

2808
00:46:54,870 --> 00:46:54,880
of how this whole mess works
 

2809
00:46:54,880 --> 00:46:55,670
of how this whole mess works
well

2810
00:46:55,670 --> 00:46:55,680
well
 

2811
00:46:55,680 --> 00:46:56,950
well
i think that

2812
00:46:56,950 --> 00:46:56,960
i think that
 

2813
00:46:56,960 --> 00:46:59,109
i think that
each theory that we propose will give

2814
00:46:59,109 --> 00:46:59,119
each theory that we propose will give
 

2815
00:46:59,119 --> 00:47:01,750
each theory that we propose will give
its own answer to that question right so

2816
00:47:01,750 --> 00:47:01,760
its own answer to that question right so
 

2817
00:47:01,760 --> 00:47:03,990
its own answer to that question right so
when the physicists are proposing um

2818
00:47:03,990 --> 00:47:04,000
when the physicists are proposing um
 

2819
00:47:04,000 --> 00:47:07,030
when the physicists are proposing um
these structures like the amplitude and

2820
00:47:07,030 --> 00:47:07,040
these structures like the amplitude and
 

2821
00:47:07,040 --> 00:47:09,109
these structures like the amplitude and
cosmological polytope sociohedron and so

2822
00:47:09,109 --> 00:47:09,119
cosmological polytope sociohedron and so
 

2823
00:47:09,119 --> 00:47:11,910
cosmological polytope sociohedron and so
forth beyond space time we can then ask

2824
00:47:11,910 --> 00:47:11,920
forth beyond space time we can then ask
 

2825
00:47:11,920 --> 00:47:13,670
forth beyond space time we can then ask
your question for those specific

2826
00:47:13,670 --> 00:47:13,680
your question for those specific
 

2827
00:47:13,680 --> 00:47:16,390
your question for those specific
structures and say how much information

2828
00:47:16,390 --> 00:47:16,400
structures and say how much information
 

2829
00:47:16,400 --> 00:47:17,670
structures and say how much information
for example

2830
00:47:17,670 --> 00:47:17,680
for example
 

2831
00:47:17,680 --> 00:47:19,190
for example
does evolution financial selection and

2832
00:47:19,190 --> 00:47:19,200
does evolution financial selection and
 

2833
00:47:19,200 --> 00:47:20,630
does evolution financial selection and
the the

2834
00:47:20,630 --> 00:47:20,640
the the
 

2835
00:47:20,640 --> 00:47:22,950
the the
kinds of sensory

2836
00:47:22,950 --> 00:47:22,960
kinds of sensory
 

2837
00:47:22,960 --> 00:47:24,870
kinds of sensory
systems that we have right now give us

2838
00:47:24,870 --> 00:47:24,880
systems that we have right now give us
 

2839
00:47:24,880 --> 00:47:26,390
systems that we have right now give us
about this deeper

2840
00:47:26,390 --> 00:47:26,400
about this deeper
 

2841
00:47:26,400 --> 00:47:28,230
about this deeper
reality and and

2842
00:47:28,230 --> 00:47:28,240
reality and and
 

2843
00:47:28,240 --> 00:47:30,470
reality and and
why did we evolve this way we can try to

2844
00:47:30,470 --> 00:47:30,480
why did we evolve this way we can try to
 

2845
00:47:30,480 --> 00:47:32,150
why did we evolve this way we can try to
answer that that question from within

2846
00:47:32,150 --> 00:47:32,160
answer that that question from within
 

2847
00:47:32,160 --> 00:47:33,829
answer that that question from within
the deeper so there's not going to be a

2848
00:47:33,829 --> 00:47:33,839
the deeper so there's not going to be a
 

2849
00:47:33,839 --> 00:47:35,910
the deeper so there's not going to be a
general answer i think we're going to

2850
00:47:35,910 --> 00:47:35,920
general answer i think we're going to
 

2851
00:47:35,920 --> 00:47:38,309
general answer i think we're going to
what we'll have to do is posit these new

2852
00:47:38,309 --> 00:47:38,319
what we'll have to do is posit these new
 

2853
00:47:38,319 --> 00:47:40,069
what we'll have to do is posit these new
deeper theories and then try to answer

2854
00:47:40,069 --> 00:47:40,079
deeper theories and then try to answer
 

2855
00:47:40,079 --> 00:47:41,349
deeper theories and then try to answer
your question

2856
00:47:41,349 --> 00:47:41,359
your question
 

2857
00:47:41,359 --> 00:47:42,549
your question
within the framework of those deeper

2858
00:47:42,549 --> 00:47:42,559
within the framework of those deeper
 

2859
00:47:42,559 --> 00:47:43,510
within the framework of those deeper
theories

2860
00:47:43,510 --> 00:47:43,520
theories
 

2861
00:47:43,520 --> 00:47:45,510
theories
knowing full well that there will be an

2862
00:47:45,510 --> 00:47:45,520
knowing full well that there will be an
 

2863
00:47:45,520 --> 00:47:47,030
knowing full well that there will be an
even deeper theory

2864
00:47:47,030 --> 00:47:47,040
even deeper theory
 

2865
00:47:47,040 --> 00:47:49,670
even deeper theory
so is it is this paralyzing though

2866
00:47:49,670 --> 00:47:49,680
so is it is this paralyzing though
 

2867
00:47:49,680 --> 00:47:51,349
so is it is this paralyzing though
because how do we know we're not

2868
00:47:51,349 --> 00:47:51,359
because how do we know we're not
 

2869
00:47:51,359 --> 00:47:52,390
because how do we know we're not
completely

2870
00:47:52,390 --> 00:47:52,400
completely
 

2871
00:47:52,400 --> 00:47:54,230
completely
adrift

2872
00:47:54,230 --> 00:47:54,240
adrift
 

2873
00:47:54,240 --> 00:47:55,829
adrift
uh out to sea

2874
00:47:55,829 --> 00:47:55,839
uh out to sea
 

2875
00:47:55,839 --> 00:47:57,589
uh out to sea
lost forever from

2876
00:47:57,589 --> 00:47:57,599
lost forever from
 

2877
00:47:57,599 --> 00:47:59,670
lost forever from
so like that our theories are completely

2878
00:47:59,670 --> 00:47:59,680
so like that our theories are completely
 

2879
00:47:59,680 --> 00:48:03,190
so like that our theories are completely
lost so if if if it's all

2880
00:48:03,190 --> 00:48:03,200
lost so if if if it's all
 

2881
00:48:03,200 --> 00:48:06,069
lost so if if if it's all
uh if we can never truly deeply

2882
00:48:06,069 --> 00:48:06,079
uh if we can never truly deeply
 

2883
00:48:06,079 --> 00:48:09,030
uh if we can never truly deeply
introspect to the bottom

2884
00:48:09,030 --> 00:48:09,040
introspect to the bottom
 

2885
00:48:09,040 --> 00:48:10,630
introspect to the bottom
if it's always just turtles on top of

2886
00:48:10,630 --> 00:48:10,640
if it's always just turtles on top of
 

2887
00:48:10,640 --> 00:48:13,430
if it's always just turtles on top of
turtles infinitely

2888
00:48:13,430 --> 00:48:13,440
turtles infinitely
 

2889
00:48:13,440 --> 00:48:16,470
turtles infinitely
um isn't that paralyzing for a

2890
00:48:16,470 --> 00:48:16,480
um isn't that paralyzing for a
 

2891
00:48:16,480 --> 00:48:18,230
um isn't that paralyzing for a
scientific mind

2892
00:48:18,230 --> 00:48:18,240
scientific mind
 

2893
00:48:18,240 --> 00:48:19,270
scientific mind
well

2894
00:48:19,270 --> 00:48:19,280
well
 

2895
00:48:19,280 --> 00:48:20,630
well
it's interesting that you say introspect

2896
00:48:20,630 --> 00:48:20,640
it's interesting that you say introspect
 

2897
00:48:20,640 --> 00:48:23,030
it's interesting that you say introspect
to the bottom

2898
00:48:23,030 --> 00:48:23,040
to the bottom
 

2899
00:48:23,040 --> 00:48:26,309
to the bottom
because there there is that there is one

2900
00:48:26,309 --> 00:48:26,319
because there there is that there is one
 

2901
00:48:26,319 --> 00:48:28,069
because there there is that there is one
i mean again this isn't the same spirit

2902
00:48:28,069 --> 00:48:28,079
i mean again this isn't the same spirit
 

2903
00:48:28,079 --> 00:48:29,430
i mean again this isn't the same spirit
of what i said before which is it

2904
00:48:29,430 --> 00:48:29,440
of what i said before which is it
 

2905
00:48:29,440 --> 00:48:30,950
of what i said before which is it
depends on what answer you give to

2906
00:48:30,950 --> 00:48:30,960
depends on what answer you give to
 

2907
00:48:30,960 --> 00:48:33,349
depends on what answer you give to
what's beyond space time what answer we

2908
00:48:33,349 --> 00:48:33,359
what's beyond space time what answer we
 

2909
00:48:33,359 --> 00:48:35,589
what's beyond space time what answer we
would give to your question right so but

2910
00:48:35,589 --> 00:48:35,599
would give to your question right so but
 

2911
00:48:35,599 --> 00:48:38,710
would give to your question right so but
one answer that um is interesting to

2912
00:48:38,710 --> 00:48:38,720
one answer that um is interesting to
 

2913
00:48:38,720 --> 00:48:40,390
one answer that um is interesting to
explore is something that spiritual

2914
00:48:40,390 --> 00:48:40,400
explore is something that spiritual
 

2915
00:48:40,400 --> 00:48:41,670
explore is something that spiritual
traditions have said for thousands of

2916
00:48:41,670 --> 00:48:41,680
traditions have said for thousands of
 

2917
00:48:41,680 --> 00:48:44,309
traditions have said for thousands of
years but haven't said precisely so

2918
00:48:44,309 --> 00:48:44,319
years but haven't said precisely so
 

2919
00:48:44,319 --> 00:48:45,750
years but haven't said precisely so
we can't take it seriously in science

2920
00:48:45,750 --> 00:48:45,760
we can't take it seriously in science
 

2921
00:48:45,760 --> 00:48:47,349
we can't take it seriously in science
until it's made precise but we might be

2922
00:48:47,349 --> 00:48:47,359
until it's made precise but we might be
 

2923
00:48:47,359 --> 00:48:49,030
until it's made precise but we might be
able to make it precise

2924
00:48:49,030 --> 00:48:49,040
able to make it precise
 

2925
00:48:49,040 --> 00:48:51,030
able to make it precise
and and that is that um

2926
00:48:51,030 --> 00:48:51,040
and and that is that um
 

2927
00:48:51,040 --> 00:48:52,790
and and that is that um
they've they've also said something like

2928
00:48:52,790 --> 00:48:52,800
they've they've also said something like
 

2929
00:48:52,800 --> 00:48:54,630
they've they've also said something like
um space and time aren't fundamental

2930
00:48:54,630 --> 00:48:54,640
um space and time aren't fundamental
 

2931
00:48:54,640 --> 00:48:56,710
um space and time aren't fundamental
they're maya they're their illusion

2932
00:48:56,710 --> 00:48:56,720
they're maya they're their illusion
 

2933
00:48:56,720 --> 00:48:59,670
they're maya they're their illusion
and but but that um

2934
00:48:59,670 --> 00:48:59,680
and but but that um
 

2935
00:48:59,680 --> 00:49:03,109
and but but that um
if you look inside if you introspect

2936
00:49:03,109 --> 00:49:03,119
if you look inside if you introspect
 

2937
00:49:03,119 --> 00:49:04,950
if you look inside if you introspect
and let go of all of your particular

2938
00:49:04,950 --> 00:49:04,960
and let go of all of your particular
 

2939
00:49:04,960 --> 00:49:06,950
and let go of all of your particular
perceptions

2940
00:49:06,950 --> 00:49:06,960
perceptions
 

2941
00:49:06,960 --> 00:49:08,230
perceptions
uh you will come to something that's

2942
00:49:08,230 --> 00:49:08,240
uh you will come to something that's
 

2943
00:49:08,240 --> 00:49:11,109
uh you will come to something that's
beyond conceptual thought

2944
00:49:11,109 --> 00:49:11,119
beyond conceptual thought
 

2945
00:49:11,119 --> 00:49:13,109
beyond conceptual thought
and that

2946
00:49:13,109 --> 00:49:13,119
and that
 

2947
00:49:13,119 --> 00:49:13,990
and that
is

2948
00:49:13,990 --> 00:49:14,000
is
 

2949
00:49:14,000 --> 00:49:16,390
is
they claim uh being in contact with the

2950
00:49:16,390 --> 00:49:16,400
they claim uh being in contact with the
 

2951
00:49:16,400 --> 00:49:18,069
they claim uh being in contact with the
deep ground of being that that

2952
00:49:18,069 --> 00:49:18,079
deep ground of being that that
 

2953
00:49:18,079 --> 00:49:19,910
deep ground of being that that
transcends any particular conceptual

2954
00:49:19,910 --> 00:49:19,920
transcends any particular conceptual
 

2955
00:49:19,920 --> 00:49:21,109
transcends any particular conceptual
understanding

2956
00:49:21,109 --> 00:49:21,119
understanding
 

2957
00:49:21,119 --> 00:49:22,870
understanding
if that is correct now i'm not saying is

2958
00:49:22,870 --> 00:49:22,880
if that is correct now i'm not saying is
 

2959
00:49:22,880 --> 00:49:24,150
if that is correct now i'm not saying is
correct

2960
00:49:24,150 --> 00:49:24,160
correct
 

2961
00:49:24,160 --> 00:49:25,829
correct
but and i'm not saying it's not correct

2962
00:49:25,829 --> 00:49:25,839
but and i'm not saying it's not correct
 

2963
00:49:25,839 --> 00:49:28,230
but and i'm not saying it's not correct
i'm just saying if that's correct

2964
00:49:28,230 --> 00:49:28,240
i'm just saying if that's correct
 

2965
00:49:28,240 --> 00:49:29,910
i'm just saying if that's correct
then it would be the case that as

2966
00:49:29,910 --> 00:49:29,920
then it would be the case that as
 

2967
00:49:29,920 --> 00:49:31,750
then it would be the case that as
scientists because

2968
00:49:31,750 --> 00:49:31,760
scientists because
 

2969
00:49:31,760 --> 00:49:33,190
scientists because
we also are in touch with this ground of

2970
00:49:33,190 --> 00:49:33,200
we also are in touch with this ground of
 

2971
00:49:33,200 --> 00:49:33,990
we also are in touch with this ground of
being

2972
00:49:33,990 --> 00:49:34,000
being
 

2973
00:49:34,000 --> 00:49:35,910
being
we would then

2974
00:49:35,910 --> 00:49:35,920
we would then
 

2975
00:49:35,920 --> 00:49:38,230
we would then
not be able to conceptually understand

2976
00:49:38,230 --> 00:49:38,240
not be able to conceptually understand
 

2977
00:49:38,240 --> 00:49:39,910
not be able to conceptually understand
ourselves all the way

2978
00:49:39,910 --> 00:49:39,920
ourselves all the way
 

2979
00:49:39,920 --> 00:49:41,349
ourselves all the way
but we could know ourselves just by

2980
00:49:41,349 --> 00:49:41,359
but we could know ourselves just by
 

2981
00:49:41,359 --> 00:49:43,430
but we could know ourselves just by
being ourselves

2982
00:49:43,430 --> 00:49:43,440
being ourselves
 

2983
00:49:43,440 --> 00:49:45,990
being ourselves
and so we would there would be a sense

2984
00:49:45,990 --> 00:49:46,000
and so we would there would be a sense
 

2985
00:49:46,000 --> 00:49:47,270
and so we would there would be a sense
in which

2986
00:49:47,270 --> 00:49:47,280
in which
 

2987
00:49:47,280 --> 00:49:49,030
in which
there is a fundamental grounding to the

2988
00:49:49,030 --> 00:49:49,040
there is a fundamental grounding to the
 

2989
00:49:49,040 --> 00:49:49,829
there is a fundamental grounding to the
whole

2990
00:49:49,829 --> 00:49:49,839
whole

00:49:49,839 --> 00:49:51,670
whole

00:49:51,670 --> 00:49:51,680
enterprise because we're not separate
 

2993
00:49:51,680 --> 00:49:53,109
enterprise because we're not separate
from the enterprise

2994
00:49:53,109 --> 00:49:53,119
from the enterprise
 

2995
00:49:53,119 --> 00:49:55,430
from the enterprise
this is the opposite of third the

2996
00:49:55,430 --> 00:49:55,440
this is the opposite of third the
 

2997
00:49:55,440 --> 00:49:57,270
this is the opposite of third the
impersonal third person science this

2998
00:49:57,270 --> 00:49:57,280
impersonal third person science this
 

2999
00:49:57,280 --> 00:49:59,109
impersonal third person science this
this would make science be personal

3000
00:49:59,109 --> 00:49:59,119
this would make science be personal
 

3001
00:49:59,119 --> 00:50:01,510
this would make science be personal
personal all the way down

3002
00:50:01,510 --> 00:50:01,520
personal all the way down
 

3003
00:50:01,520 --> 00:50:03,910
personal all the way down
and and but but nevertheless scientific

3004
00:50:03,910 --> 00:50:03,920
and and but but nevertheless scientific
 

3005
00:50:03,920 --> 00:50:05,190
and and but but nevertheless scientific
because the scientific method would

3006
00:50:05,190 --> 00:50:05,200
because the scientific method would
 

3007
00:50:05,200 --> 00:50:06,950
because the scientific method would
still be

3008
00:50:06,950 --> 00:50:06,960
still be
 

3009
00:50:06,960 --> 00:50:08,950
still be
what we would use all the way

3010
00:50:08,950 --> 00:50:08,960
what we would use all the way
 

3011
00:50:08,960 --> 00:50:10,309
what we would use all the way
down for the conceptual understanding

3012
00:50:10,309 --> 00:50:10,319
down for the conceptual understanding
 

3013
00:50:10,319 --> 00:50:11,589
down for the conceptual understanding
unfortunately still don't know if you

3014
00:50:11,589 --> 00:50:11,599
unfortunately still don't know if you
 

3015
00:50:11,599 --> 00:50:13,829
unfortunately still don't know if you
went all the way down it's possible that

3016
00:50:13,829 --> 00:50:13,839
went all the way down it's possible that
 

3017
00:50:13,839 --> 00:50:15,750
went all the way down it's possible that
this kind of whatever consciousness is

3018
00:50:15,750 --> 00:50:15,760
this kind of whatever consciousness is
 

3019
00:50:15,760 --> 00:50:20,309
this kind of whatever consciousness is
and we'll talk about it is getting um

3020
00:50:20,309 --> 00:50:20,319

 

3021
00:50:20,319 --> 00:50:23,270

the cliche statement of be yourself

3022
00:50:23,270 --> 00:50:23,280
the cliche statement of be yourself
 

3023
00:50:23,280 --> 00:50:26,549
the cliche statement of be yourself
uh is is it is somehow digging at a

3024
00:50:26,549 --> 00:50:26,559
uh is is it is somehow digging at a
 

3025
00:50:26,559 --> 00:50:29,270
uh is is it is somehow digging at a
deeper truth of reality but you still

3026
00:50:29,270 --> 00:50:29,280
deeper truth of reality but you still
 

3027
00:50:29,280 --> 00:50:31,589
deeper truth of reality but you still
don't know when you get to the bottom

3028
00:50:31,589 --> 00:50:31,599
don't know when you get to the bottom
 

3029
00:50:31,599 --> 00:50:32,790
don't know when you get to the bottom
you know a lot of people they'll take

3030
00:50:32,790 --> 00:50:32,800
you know a lot of people they'll take
 

3031
00:50:32,800 --> 00:50:35,109
you know a lot of people they'll take
psychedelic drugs and they'll say well

3032
00:50:35,109 --> 00:50:35,119
psychedelic drugs and they'll say well
 

3033
00:50:35,119 --> 00:50:37,910
psychedelic drugs and they'll say well
that takes my mind to certain places

3034
00:50:37,910 --> 00:50:37,920
that takes my mind to certain places
 

3035
00:50:37,920 --> 00:50:41,030
that takes my mind to certain places
where it feels like that is revealing

3036
00:50:41,030 --> 00:50:41,040
where it feels like that is revealing
 

3037
00:50:41,040 --> 00:50:43,349
where it feels like that is revealing
some deeper truth of reality but it's

3038
00:50:43,349 --> 00:50:43,359
some deeper truth of reality but it's
 

3039
00:50:43,359 --> 00:50:44,150
some deeper truth of reality but it's
still

3040
00:50:44,150 --> 00:50:44,160
still
 

3041
00:50:44,160 --> 00:50:45,670
still
it could be interfaces on top of

it could be interfaces on top of
 

3043
00:50:45,680 --> 00:50:48,950
it could be interfaces on top of
interfaces that's that's um in your view

3044
00:50:48,950 --> 00:50:48,960
interfaces that's that's um in your view
 

3045
00:50:48,960 --> 00:50:50,870
interfaces that's that's um in your view
of this

3046
00:50:50,870 --> 00:50:50,880
of this
 

3047
00:50:50,880 --> 00:50:52,390
of this
you really don't know

3048
00:50:52,390 --> 00:50:52,400
you really don't know

00:50:52,400 --> 00:50:54,309
you really don't know
it means gato's and completeness is that

00:50:54,309 --> 00:50:54,319
it means gato's and completeness is that
 

3051
00:50:54,319 --> 00:50:57,349
it means gato's and completeness is that
you really don't know my own view on it

3052
00:50:57,349 --> 00:50:57,359
you really don't know my own view on it
 

3053
00:50:57,359 --> 00:50:59,589
you really don't know my own view on it
for what it's worth

3054
00:50:59,589 --> 00:50:59,599
for what it's worth
 

3055
00:50:59,599 --> 00:51:00,549
for what it's worth
because i don't know the right answer

3056
00:51:00,549 --> 00:51:00,559
because i don't know the right answer
 

3057
00:51:00,559 --> 00:51:02,549
because i don't know the right answer
but my own view on it right now is that

3058
00:51:02,549 --> 00:51:02,559
but my own view on it right now is that
 

3059
00:51:02,559 --> 00:51:04,150
but my own view on it right now is that
it um

3060
00:51:04,150 --> 00:51:04,160
it um
 

3061
00:51:04,160 --> 00:51:05,589
it um
it's never ending

3062
00:51:05,589 --> 00:51:05,599
it's never ending
 

3063
00:51:05,599 --> 00:51:07,589
it's never ending
i think that there will never that this

3064
00:51:07,589 --> 00:51:07,599
i think that there will never that this
 

3065
00:51:07,599 --> 00:51:10,069
i think that there will never that this
is great as i said before great um job

3066
00:51:10,069 --> 00:51:10,079
is great as i said before great um job
 

3067
00:51:10,079 --> 00:51:11,910
is great as i said before great um job
security for science

3068
00:51:11,910 --> 00:51:11,920
security for science
 

3069
00:51:11,920 --> 00:51:13,829
security for science
and that we

3070
00:51:13,829 --> 00:51:13,839
and that we
 

3071
00:51:13,839 --> 00:51:16,309
and that we
if this is true and if if consciousness

3072
00:51:16,309 --> 00:51:16,319
if this is true and if if consciousness
 

3073
00:51:16,319 --> 00:51:18,150
if this is true and if if consciousness
is somehow important or fundamental in

is somehow important or fundamental in

00:51:18,160 --> 00:51:19,750
is somehow important or fundamental in

the universe this may be an important
 

3077
00:51:19,760 --> 00:51:21,349
the universe this may be an important
fundamental fact about consciousness

3078
00:51:21,349 --> 00:51:21,359
fundamental fact about consciousness
 

3079
00:51:21,359 --> 00:51:24,230
fundamental fact about consciousness
itself that that it's the never-ending

3080
00:51:24,230 --> 00:51:24,240
itself that that it's the never-ending

sense
 

3085
00:51:27,440 --> 00:51:30,230
sense
well well that's interesting you push

3086
00:51:30,230 --> 00:51:30,240
well well that's interesting you push
 

3087
00:51:30,240 --> 00:51:34,309
well well that's interesting you push
back on the job security okay

3088
00:51:34,309 --> 00:51:34,319

 

3089
00:51:34,319 --> 00:51:36,790

so maybe as we understand this kind of

3090
00:51:36,790 --> 00:51:36,800
so maybe as we understand this kind of
 

3091
00:51:36,800 --> 00:51:38,950
so maybe as we understand this kind of
idea deeper and deeper

3092
00:51:38,950 --> 00:51:38,960
idea deeper and deeper
 

3093
00:51:38,960 --> 00:51:41,349
idea deeper and deeper
we understand that the pursuit is not a

3094
00:51:41,349 --> 00:51:41,359
we understand that the pursuit is not a
 

3095
00:51:41,359 --> 00:51:42,790
we understand that the pursuit is not a
fruitful one

3096
00:51:42,790 --> 00:51:42,800
fruitful one
 

3097
00:51:42,800 --> 00:51:45,030
fruitful one
then maybe we need to

3098
00:51:45,030 --> 00:51:45,040
then maybe we need to
 

3099
00:51:45,040 --> 00:51:47,510
then maybe we need to
maybe that's why we don't see aliens

3100
00:51:47,510 --> 00:51:47,520
maybe that's why we don't see aliens
 

3101
00:51:47,520 --> 00:51:49,589
maybe that's why we don't see aliens
everywhere as you get smarter and

3102
00:51:49,589 --> 00:51:49,599
everywhere as you get smarter and
 

3103
00:51:49,599 --> 00:51:52,150
everywhere as you get smarter and
smarter and smarter you realize that

3104
00:51:52,150 --> 00:51:52,160
smarter and smarter you realize that
 

3105
00:51:52,160 --> 00:51:54,710
smarter and smarter you realize that
like exploration

3106
00:51:54,710 --> 00:51:54,720
like exploration
 

3107
00:51:54,720 --> 00:51:56,950
like exploration
is uh there's other fun ways to spend

3108

uh that's that allows us to study our
 

3201
00:53:28,880 --> 00:53:30,630
uh that's that allows us to study our
own history but

wrote down a few equations which we can
 

3227
00:53:56,559 --> 00:53:58,069
wrote down a few equations which we can
now write down in the single equation

00:54:36,319 --> 00:54:37,990
us at
the speed of light or beyond so we can't

3266
00:54:37,990 --> 00:54:38,000
the speed of light or beyond so we can't
 

3267
00:54:38,000 --> 00:54:39,589
the speed of light or beyond so we can't
we can't ever get to them so there's all

3268
00:54:39,589 --> 00:54:39,599
we can't ever get to them so there's all
 

3269
00:54:39,599 --> 00:54:41,430
we can't ever get to them so there's all
this beautiful real estate that's just

3270
00:54:41,430 --> 00:54:41,440
this beautiful real estate that's just
 

3271
00:54:41,440 --> 00:54:42,950
this beautiful real estate that's just
smiling and waving at us and we can

3272
00:54:42,950 --> 00:54:42,960
smiling and waving at us and we can
 

3273
00:54:42,960 --> 00:54:44,150
smiling and waving at us and we can
never get to it

3274
00:54:44,150 --> 00:54:44,160
never get to it
 

3275
00:54:44,160 --> 00:54:45,589
never get to it
yeah but that's if we go through

3276
00:54:45,589 --> 00:54:45,599
yeah but that's if we go through
 

3277
00:54:45,599 --> 00:54:47,190
yeah but that's if we go through
spacetime

3278
00:54:47,190 --> 00:54:47,200
spacetime
 

3279
00:54:47,200 --> 00:54:48,870
spacetime
but if we recognize that spacetime is

3280
00:54:48,870 --> 00:54:48,880
but if we recognize that spacetime is
 

3281
00:54:48,880 --> 00:54:50,630
but if we recognize that spacetime is
just a data structure

3282
00:54:50,630 --> 00:54:50,640
just a data structure
 

3283
00:54:50,640 --> 00:54:52,549
just a data structure
it's not fundamental

3284
00:54:52,549 --> 00:54:52,559
it's not fundamental
 

3285
00:54:52,559 --> 00:54:53,670
it's not fundamental
we're not

3286
00:54:53,670 --> 00:54:53,680
we're not
 

3287
00:54:53,680 --> 00:54:56,069
we're not
little things inside space time

3288
00:54:56,069 --> 00:54:56,079
little things inside space time
 

3289
00:54:56,079 --> 00:54:58,390
little things inside space time
space-time is a little data structure

3290
00:54:58,390 --> 00:54:58,400
space-time is a little data structure
 

3291
00:54:58,400 --> 00:55:00,069
space-time is a little data structure
in our perceptions

3292
00:55:00,069 --> 00:55:00,079
in our perceptions
 

3293
00:55:00,079 --> 00:55:01,910
in our perceptions
it's just the other way around

3294
00:55:01,910 --> 00:55:01,920
it's just the other way around
 

3295
00:55:01,920 --> 00:55:04,150
it's just the other way around
once we understand that

3296
00:55:04,150 --> 00:55:04,160
once we understand that
 

3297
00:55:04,160 --> 00:55:05,750
once we understand that
and when we get equations for the stuff

3298
00:55:05,750 --> 00:55:05,760
and when we get equations for the stuff
 

3299
00:55:05,760 --> 00:55:09,109
and when we get equations for the stuff
that's beyond space time

3300
00:55:09,109 --> 00:55:09,119

 

3301
00:55:09,119 --> 00:55:10,309

maybe we won't have to go through space

3302
00:55:10,309 --> 00:55:10,319
maybe we won't have to go through space
 

3303
00:55:10,319 --> 00:55:11,990
maybe we won't have to go through space
time maybe we can go around it maybe i

3304
00:55:11,990 --> 00:55:12,000
time maybe we can go around it maybe i
 

3305
00:55:12,000 --> 00:55:13,670
time maybe we can go around it maybe i
can go to proxima centauri and not go

3306
00:55:13,670 --> 00:55:13,680
can go to proxima centauri and not go
 

3307
00:55:13,680 --> 00:55:15,190
can go to proxima centauri and not go
through space i can just

3308
00:55:15,190 --> 00:55:15,200
through space i can just
 

3309
00:55:15,200 --> 00:55:17,190
through space i can just
go right there directly it's a data

3310
00:55:17,190 --> 00:55:17,200
go right there directly it's a data
 

3311
00:55:17,200 --> 00:55:19,270
go right there directly it's a data
structure we can start to play with it

3312
00:55:19,270 --> 00:55:19,280
structure we can start to play with it
 

3313
00:55:19,280 --> 00:55:22,150
structure we can start to play with it
so so i think that

3314
00:55:22,150 --> 00:55:22,160
so so i think that
 

3315
00:55:22,160 --> 00:55:24,710
so so i think that
my for what it's worth my take would be

3316
00:55:24,710 --> 00:55:24,720
my for what it's worth my take would be
 

3317
00:55:24,720 --> 00:55:25,510
my for what it's worth my take would be
that

3318
00:55:25,510 --> 00:55:25,520
that
 

3319
00:55:25,520 --> 00:55:28,470
that
that the endless

3320
00:55:28,470 --> 00:55:28,480
that the endless
 

3321
00:55:28,480 --> 00:55:31,589
that the endless
sequence of theories that we could

3322
00:55:31,589 --> 00:55:31,599
sequence of theories that we could
 

3323
00:55:31,599 --> 00:55:33,510
sequence of theories that we could
contemplate building will lead to an

3324
00:55:33,510 --> 00:55:33,520
contemplate building will lead to an
 

3325
00:55:33,520 --> 00:55:35,030
contemplate building will lead to an
endless

3326
00:55:35,030 --> 00:55:35,040
endless
 

3327
00:55:35,040 --> 00:55:38,870
endless
sequence of new remarkable insights into

3328
00:55:38,870 --> 00:55:38,880
sequence of new remarkable insights into
 

3329
00:55:38,880 --> 00:55:41,349
sequence of new remarkable insights into
the potentialities the possibilities

3330
00:55:41,349 --> 00:55:41,359
the potentialities the possibilities
 

3331
00:55:41,359 --> 00:55:42,870
the potentialities the possibilities
that would that would that would seem

3332
00:55:42,870 --> 00:55:42,880
that would that would that would seem
 

3333
00:55:42,880 --> 00:55:44,950
that would that would that would seem
miraculous to us and that we will be

3334
00:55:44,950 --> 00:55:44,960
miraculous to us and that we will be
 

3335
00:55:44,960 --> 00:55:47,510
miraculous to us and that we will be
motivated to continue the exploration

3336
00:55:47,510 --> 00:55:47,520
motivated to continue the exploration
 

3337
00:55:47,520 --> 00:55:48,390

partly
 

3339
00:55:48,400 --> 00:55:50,470
partly
um just for the technological

3340
00:55:50,470 --> 00:55:50,480
um just for the technological
 

3341
00:55:50,480 --> 00:55:52,789
um just for the technological
innovations that that come out

3342
00:55:52,789 --> 00:55:52,799
innovations that that come out
 

3343
00:55:52,799 --> 00:55:54,710
innovations that that come out
but

3344
00:55:54,710 --> 00:55:54,720
but
 

3345
00:55:54,720 --> 00:55:55,589
but
you're the other thing that you

00:55:55,589 --> 00:55:55,599
you're the other thing that you

you're the other thing that you
mentioned though what about just being

3348
00:55:57,670 --> 00:55:57,680
mentioned though what about just being
 

3349
00:55:57,680 --> 00:55:59,750
mentioned though what about just being
what if we when we decide instead of all

3350
00:55:59,750 --> 00:55:59,760
what if we when we decide instead of all
 

3351
00:55:59,760 --> 00:56:01,510
what if we when we decide instead of all
this doing and exploring what about

3352
00:56:01,510 --> 00:56:01,520
this doing and exploring what about
 

3353
00:56:01,520 --> 00:56:03,750
this doing and exploring what about
being my guess is that the best

3354
00:56:03,750 --> 00:56:03,760
being my guess is that the best
 

3355
00:56:03,760 --> 00:56:05,030
being my guess is that the best
scientists

3356
00:56:05,030 --> 00:56:05,040
scientists
 

3357
00:56:05,040 --> 00:56:07,510
scientists
will do both and that

3358
00:56:07,510 --> 00:56:07,520
will do both and that
 

3359
00:56:07,520 --> 00:56:08,870
will do both and that
the

3360
00:56:08,870 --> 00:56:08,880
the
 

3361
00:56:08,880 --> 00:56:11,430
the
act of being

3362
00:56:11,430 --> 00:56:11,440
act of being
 

3363
00:56:11,440 --> 00:56:13,190
act of being
will be a place where they get many of

3364
00:56:13,190 --> 00:56:13,200
will be a place where they get many of
 

3365
00:56:13,200 --> 00:56:14,710
will be a place where they get many of
their ideas

3366
00:56:14,710 --> 00:56:14,720
their ideas
 

3367
00:56:14,720 --> 00:56:16,789
their ideas
and that they then pull into the

3368
00:56:16,789 --> 00:56:16,799
and that they then pull into the
 

3369
00:56:16,799 --> 00:56:19,589
and that they then pull into the
conceptual realm and i think many of the

3370
00:56:19,589 --> 00:56:19,599
conceptual realm and i think many of the
 

3371
00:56:19,599 --> 00:56:21,670
conceptual realm and i think many of the
best scientists like einstein comes to

3372
00:56:21,670 --> 00:56:21,680
best scientists like einstein comes to
 

3373
00:56:21,680 --> 00:56:23,349
best scientists like einstein comes to
mind right where these guys say look i

3374
00:56:23,349 --> 00:56:23,359
mind right where these guys say look i
 

3375
00:56:23,359 --> 00:56:25,670
mind right where these guys say look i
didn't come up with these ideas by a

3376
00:56:25,670 --> 00:56:25,680
didn't come up with these ideas by a
 

3377
00:56:25,680 --> 00:56:27,510
didn't come up with these ideas by a
conceptual analysis

3378
00:56:27,510 --> 00:56:27,520
conceptual analysis
 

3379
00:56:27,520 --> 00:56:30,630
conceptual analysis
i was thinking in vague images and i was

3380
00:56:30,630 --> 00:56:30,640
i was thinking in vague images and i was
 

3381
00:56:30,640 --> 00:56:32,630
i was thinking in vague images and i was
it was just something

3382
00:56:32,630 --> 00:56:32,640
it was just something
 

3383
00:56:32,640 --> 00:56:34,789
it was just something
non-conceptual and then it took me a

3384
00:56:34,789 --> 00:56:34,799
non-conceptual and then it took me a
 

3385
00:56:34,799 --> 00:56:37,430
non-conceptual and then it took me a
long long time to pull it out into

3386
00:56:37,430 --> 00:56:37,440
long long time to pull it out into
 

3387
00:56:37,440 --> 00:56:39,829
long long time to pull it out into
concepts and then longer to put it into

3388
00:56:39,829 --> 00:56:39,839
concepts and then longer to put it into
 

3389
00:56:39,839 --> 00:56:42,309
concepts and then longer to put it into
math but the real insights didn't come

3390
00:56:42,309 --> 00:56:42,319
math but the real insights didn't come
 

3391
00:56:42,319 --> 00:56:44,309
math but the real insights didn't come
from just slavishly right you know

3392
00:56:44,309 --> 00:56:44,319
from just slavishly right you know
 

3393
00:56:44,319 --> 00:56:46,870
from just slavishly right you know
playing with equations they came from a

3394
00:56:46,870 --> 00:56:46,880
playing with equations they came from a
 

3395
00:56:46,880 --> 00:56:48,150
playing with equations they came from a
deeper place

3396
00:56:48,150 --> 00:56:48,160
deeper place
 

3397
00:56:48,160 --> 00:56:50,710
deeper place
and so there there may be this going

3398
00:56:50,710 --> 00:56:50,720
and so there there may be this going
 

3399
00:56:50,720 --> 00:56:52,710
and so there there may be this going
back and forth between the complete

3400
00:56:52,710 --> 00:56:52,720
back and forth between the complete
 

3401
00:56:52,720 --> 00:56:54,549
back and forth between the complete
non-conceptual

3402
00:56:54,549 --> 00:56:54,559
non-conceptual
 

3403
00:56:54,559 --> 00:56:56,789
non-conceptual
where there's essentially no end to the

3404
00:56:56,789 --> 00:56:56,799
where there's essentially no end to the
 

3405
00:56:56,799 --> 00:56:58,789
where there's essentially no end to the
wisdom and then conceptual systems where

3406
00:56:58,789 --> 00:56:58,799
wisdom and then conceptual systems where
 

3407
00:56:58,799 --> 00:57:00,789
wisdom and then conceptual systems where
there's the girdle limits um that we

3408
00:57:00,789 --> 00:57:00,799
there's the girdle limits um that we
 

3409
00:57:00,799 --> 00:57:02,069
there's the girdle limits um that we
have to that

3410
00:57:02,069 --> 00:57:02,079
have to that
 

3411
00:57:02,079 --> 00:57:04,630
have to that
and that may be if consciousness is

3412
00:57:04,630 --> 00:57:04,640
and that may be if consciousness is
 

3413
00:57:04,640 --> 00:57:06,470
and that may be if consciousness is
is important than fundamental that may

3414
00:57:06,470 --> 00:57:06,480
is important than fundamental that may
 

3415
00:57:06,480 --> 00:57:08,150
is important than fundamental that may
be what consciousness at least part of

3416
00:57:08,150 --> 00:57:08,160
be what consciousness at least part of
 

3417
00:57:08,160 --> 00:57:10,230
be what consciousness at least part of
what consciousness is about is this

3418
00:57:10,230 --> 00:57:10,240
what consciousness is about is this
 

3419
00:57:10,240 --> 00:57:11,750
what consciousness is about is this
discovering itself

3420
00:57:11,750 --> 00:57:11,760
discovering itself
 

3421
00:57:11,760 --> 00:57:13,589
discovering itself
discovering its possibilities so to

3422
00:57:13,589 --> 00:57:13,599
discovering its possibilities so to
 

3423
00:57:13,599 --> 00:57:15,430
discovering its possibilities so to
speak we can talk about what that might

3424
00:57:15,430 --> 00:57:15,440
speak we can talk about what that might
 

3425
00:57:15,440 --> 00:57:16,230
speak we can talk about what that might
mean

3426
00:57:16,230 --> 00:57:16,240
mean
 

3427
00:57:16,240 --> 00:57:17,109
mean
um

um but as you get you know to 86 billion

00:59:14,079 --> 00:59:15,910

00:59:47,119 --> 00:59:48,470
anything important and and
but

3586
00:59:48,470 --> 00:59:48,480
but
 

3587
00:59:48,480 --> 00:59:50,470
but
we could then just look at how the genes

3588
00:59:50,470 --> 00:59:50,480
we could then just look at how the genes
 

3589
00:59:50,480 --> 00:59:53,589
we could then just look at how the genes
evolved and and what we found was

3590
00:59:53,589 --> 00:59:53,599
evolved and and what we found was
 

3591
00:59:53,599 --> 00:59:57,750
evolved and and what we found was

00:59:57,750 --> 00:59:57,760
what what what what he found was that uh
 

3593
00:59:57,760 --> 00:59:59,670
what what what what he found was that uh
basically you never even saw

organisms even come on the stage they

3600
01:00:05,430 --> 01:00:05,440
organisms even come on the stage they
 

3601
01:00:05,440 --> 01:00:07,030
organisms even come on the stage they
they if they came but they were gone in

3602
01:00:07,030 --> 01:00:07,040
they if they came but they were gone in
 

3603
01:00:07,040 --> 01:00:08,390
they if they came but they were gone in
one generation they just they just

3604
01:00:08,390 --> 01:00:08,400
one generation they just they just
 

3605
01:00:08,400 --> 01:00:09,349
one generation they just they just
weren't

3606
01:00:09,349 --> 01:00:09,359
weren't
 

3607
01:00:09,359 --> 01:00:11,670
weren't
so they they they came and got they came

3608
01:00:11,670 --> 01:00:11,680
so they they they came and got they came
 

3609
01:00:11,680 --> 01:00:12,870
so they they they came and got they came
and went uh

3610
01:00:12,870 --> 01:00:12,880
and went uh
 

3611
01:00:12,880 --> 01:00:15,190
and went uh
even just in one generation they just

3612
01:00:15,190 --> 01:00:15,200
even just in one generation they just
 

3613
01:00:15,200 --> 01:00:16,950
even just in one generation they just
are not good enough the ones that were

3614
01:00:16,950 --> 01:00:16,960
are not good enough the ones that were
 

3615
01:00:16,960 --> 01:00:18,789
are not good enough the ones that were
just tracking their senses just were

just tracking their senses just were
 

3617
01:00:18,799 --> 01:00:20,870

so from so an answer at one level i want

3626
01:00:30,549 --> 01:00:30,559
so from so an answer at one level i want
 

3627
01:00:30,559 --> 01:00:32,069
so from so an answer at one level i want
to give an answer at a deeper level but

3628
01:00:32,069 --> 01:00:32,079
to give an answer at a deeper level but
 

3629
01:00:32,079 --> 01:00:33,990
to give an answer at a deeper level but
just with evolutionary game theory

3630
01:00:33,990 --> 01:00:34,000
just with evolutionary game theory
 

3631
01:00:34,000 --> 01:00:37,109
just with evolutionary game theory
because my attitude as a scientist is um

3632
01:00:37,109 --> 01:00:37,119
because my attitude as a scientist is um
 

3633
01:00:37,119 --> 01:00:39,990
because my attitude as a scientist is um
i don't believe any of our theories

3634
01:00:39,990 --> 01:00:40,000
i don't believe any of our theories
 

3635
01:00:40,000 --> 01:00:41,750
i don't believe any of our theories
i take them very very seriously i study

3636
01:00:41,750 --> 01:00:41,760
i take them very very seriously i study
 

3637
01:00:41,760 --> 01:00:43,670
i take them very very seriously i study
them i look at their implications but

3638
01:00:43,670 --> 01:00:43,680
them i look at their implications but
 

3639
01:00:43,680 --> 01:00:45,109
them i look at their implications but
none of them are the gospel they're just

3640
01:00:45,109 --> 01:00:45,119
none of them are the gospel they're just
 

3641
01:00:45,119 --> 01:00:47,430
none of them are the gospel they're just
the latest ideas that we have and you

3642
01:00:47,430 --> 01:00:47,440
the latest ideas that we have and you
 

3643
01:00:47,440 --> 01:00:48,870
the latest ideas that we have and you
know so

3644
01:00:48,870 --> 01:00:48,880
know so
 

3645
01:00:48,880 --> 01:00:50,230
know so
the reason i study evolutionary game

3646
01:00:50,230 --> 01:00:50,240
the reason i study evolutionary game
 

3647
01:00:50,240 --> 01:00:51,990
the reason i study evolutionary game
theory is because that's the best tool

3648
01:00:51,990 --> 01:00:52,000
theory is because that's the best tool
 

3649
01:00:52,000 --> 01:00:52,870
theory is because that's the best tool
we have

3650
01:00:52,870 --> 01:00:52,880
we have
 

3651
01:00:52,880 --> 01:00:54,870
we have
right now in this area

3652
01:00:54,870 --> 01:00:54,880
right now in this area
 

3653
01:00:54,880 --> 01:00:56,710
right now in this area
there's there isn't nothing else that

3654
01:00:56,710 --> 01:00:56,720
there's there isn't nothing else that
 

3655
01:00:56,720 --> 01:00:58,710
there's there isn't nothing else that
competes and so as a scientist it's my

3656
01:00:58,710 --> 01:00:58,720
competes and so as a scientist it's my
 

3657
01:00:58,720 --> 01:01:00,470
competes and so as a scientist it's my
responsibility to take the best tools

3658
01:01:00,470 --> 01:01:00,480
responsibility to take the best tools
 

3659
01:01:00,480 --> 01:01:02,390
responsibility to take the best tools
and see what they mean and the same

3660
01:01:02,390 --> 01:01:02,400
and see what they mean and the same
 

3661
01:01:02,400 --> 01:01:03,829
and see what they mean and the same
thing the physicists are doing they're

3662
01:01:03,829 --> 01:01:03,839
thing the physicists are doing they're
 

3663
01:01:03,839 --> 01:01:05,349
thing the physicists are doing they're
taking the best tools and looking at

3664
01:01:05,349 --> 01:01:05,359
taking the best tools and looking at
 

3665
01:01:05,359 --> 01:01:07,030
taking the best tools and looking at
what what they entail

3666
01:01:07,030 --> 01:01:07,040
what what they entail
 

3667
01:01:07,040 --> 01:01:09,670
what what they entail
but i don't i i think that

3668
01:01:09,670 --> 01:01:09,680
but i don't i i think that
 

3669
01:01:09,680 --> 01:01:11,670
but i don't i i think that
science now has enough experience to

3670
01:01:11,670 --> 01:01:11,680
science now has enough experience to
 

3671
01:01:11,680 --> 01:01:13,589
science now has enough experience to
realize that we should not

3672
01:01:13,589 --> 01:01:13,599
realize that we should not
 

3673
01:01:13,599 --> 01:01:15,270
realize that we should not
believe our theories

3674
01:01:15,270 --> 01:01:15,280
believe our theories
 

3675
01:01:15,280 --> 01:01:17,750
believe our theories
in the sense that we've now arrived

3676
01:01:17,750 --> 01:01:17,760
in the sense that we've now arrived
 

3677
01:01:17,760 --> 01:01:20,950
in the sense that we've now arrived
in 1890 it was a lot of physicists

3678
01:01:20,950 --> 01:01:20,960
in 1890 it was a lot of physicists
 

3679
01:01:20,960 --> 01:01:22,829
in 1890 it was a lot of physicists
thought we'd arrived they were

3680
01:01:22,829 --> 01:01:22,839
thought we'd arrived they were
 

3681
01:01:22,839 --> 01:01:25,910
thought we'd arrived they were
discouraging um bright young

3682
01:01:25,910 --> 01:01:25,920
discouraging um bright young
 

3683
01:01:25,920 --> 01:01:27,589
discouraging um bright young
students from going into physics because

3684
01:01:27,589 --> 01:01:27,599
students from going into physics because
 

3685
01:01:27,599 --> 01:01:29,990
students from going into physics because
it was all done and that's precisely the

3686
01:01:29,990 --> 01:01:30,000
it was all done and that's precisely the
 

3687
01:01:30,000 --> 01:01:32,549
it was all done and that's precisely the
wrong attitude yeah forever this is the

3688
01:01:32,549 --> 01:01:32,559
wrong attitude yeah forever this is the
 

3689
01:01:32,559 --> 01:01:34,309
wrong attitude yeah forever this is the
wrong attitude forever

3690
01:01:34,309 --> 01:01:34,319
wrong attitude forever
 

3691
01:01:34,319 --> 01:01:36,950
wrong attitude forever
the attitude we should have is i uh a

3692
01:01:36,950 --> 01:01:36,960
the attitude we should have is i uh a
 

3693
01:01:36,960 --> 01:01:38,470
the attitude we should have is i uh a
century from now

3694
01:01:38,470 --> 01:01:38,480
century from now
 

3695
01:01:38,480 --> 01:01:40,549
century from now
they'll be looking at us and laughing at

3696
01:01:40,549 --> 01:01:40,559
they'll be looking at us and laughing at
 

3697
01:01:40,559 --> 01:01:42,230
they'll be looking at us and laughing at
what we didn't know and we just have to

3698
01:01:42,230 --> 01:01:42,240
what we didn't know and we just have to
 

3699
01:01:42,240 --> 01:01:43,670
what we didn't know and we just have to
assume that that's going to be the case

3700
01:01:43,670 --> 01:01:43,680
assume that that's going to be the case
 

3701
01:01:43,680 --> 01:01:45,589
assume that that's going to be the case
uh just just know that everything that

3702
01:01:45,589 --> 01:01:45,599
uh just just know that everything that
 

3703
01:01:45,599 --> 01:01:47,910
uh just just know that everything that
we think is so brilliant right now

3704
01:01:47,910 --> 01:01:47,920
we think is so brilliant right now
 

3705
01:01:47,920 --> 01:01:49,990
we think is so brilliant right now
our final theory a century from now

3706
01:01:49,990 --> 01:01:50,000
our final theory a century from now
 

3707
01:01:50,000 --> 01:01:51,750
our final theory a century from now
they'll look at us like we look at the

3708
01:01:51,750 --> 01:01:51,760
they'll look at us like we look at the
 

3709
01:01:51,760 --> 01:01:54,069
they'll look at us like we look at the
physicists of 1890 and go how could they

3710
01:01:54,069 --> 01:01:54,079
physicists of 1890 and go how could they
 

3711
01:01:54,079 --> 01:01:56,630
physicists of 1890 and go how could they
have been so dumb yeah so so i don't

3712
01:01:56,630 --> 01:01:56,640
have been so dumb yeah so so i don't
 

3713
01:01:56,640 --> 01:01:58,549
have been so dumb yeah so so i don't
want to make that mistake so so i'm not

3714
01:01:58,549 --> 01:01:58,559
want to make that mistake so so i'm not
 

3715
01:01:58,559 --> 01:02:00,789
want to make that mistake so so i'm not
doctrinaire about

3716
01:02:00,789 --> 01:02:00,799
doctrinaire about
 

3717
01:02:00,799 --> 01:02:02,870
doctrinaire about
any of our current scientific theories i

3718
01:02:02,870 --> 01:02:02,880
any of our current scientific theories i
 

3719
01:02:02,880 --> 01:02:04,870
any of our current scientific theories i
am dr nir about

3720
01:02:04,870 --> 01:02:04,880
am dr nir about
 

3721
01:02:04,880 --> 01:02:07,430
am dr nir about
this we should use the best tools we

3722
01:02:07,430 --> 01:02:07,440
this we should use the best tools we
 

3723
01:02:07,440 --> 01:02:09,589
this we should use the best tools we
have right now

3724
01:02:09,589 --> 01:02:09,599
have right now
 

3725
01:02:09,599 --> 01:02:11,829
have right now
with with humility well

3726
01:02:11,829 --> 01:02:11,839
with with humility well
 

3727
01:02:11,839 --> 01:02:13,349
with with humility well
so let me ask you about game theory

3728
01:02:13,349 --> 01:02:13,359
so let me ask you about game theory
 

3729
01:02:13,359 --> 01:02:16,630
so let me ask you about game theory
there's um i love game theory uh

3730
01:02:16,630 --> 01:02:16,640
there's um i love game theory uh
 

3731
01:02:16,640 --> 01:02:18,230
there's um i love game theory uh
evolution game theory

3732
01:02:18,230 --> 01:02:18,240
evolution game theory
 

3733
01:02:18,240 --> 01:02:21,029
evolution game theory
um but i'm always suspicious of it um

3734
01:02:21,029 --> 01:02:21,039
um but i'm always suspicious of it um
 

3735
01:02:21,039 --> 01:02:22,950
um but i'm always suspicious of it um
like economics

3736
01:02:22,950 --> 01:02:22,960
like economics
 

3737
01:02:22,960 --> 01:02:25,750
like economics
um when you construct models

3738
01:02:25,750 --> 01:02:25,760
um when you construct models
 

3739
01:02:25,760 --> 01:02:28,630
um when you construct models
it's too easy to construct things uh

3740
01:02:28,630 --> 01:02:28,640
it's too easy to construct things uh
 

3741
01:02:28,640 --> 01:02:31,349
it's too easy to construct things uh
that oversimplify

3742
01:02:31,349 --> 01:02:31,359
that oversimplify
 

3743
01:02:31,359 --> 01:02:32,630
that oversimplify
just

3744
01:02:32,630 --> 01:02:32,640
just
 

3745
01:02:32,640 --> 01:02:35,349
just
because we our human brains enjoy the

3746
01:02:35,349 --> 01:02:35,359
because we our human brains enjoy the
 

3747
01:02:35,359 --> 01:02:36,870
because we our human brains enjoy the
simplification

3748
01:02:36,870 --> 01:02:36,880
simplification
 

3749
01:02:36,880 --> 01:02:39,029
simplification
of constructing a few variables that

3750
01:02:39,029 --> 01:02:39,039
of constructing a few variables that
 

3751
01:02:39,039 --> 01:02:41,990
of constructing a few variables that
somehow represent organisms or represent

3752
01:02:41,990 --> 01:02:42,000
somehow represent organisms or represent
 

3753
01:02:42,000 --> 01:02:42,950
somehow represent organisms or represent
people

3754
01:02:42,950 --> 01:02:42,960
people
 

3755
01:02:42,960 --> 01:02:45,029
people
and running a simulation that then

3756
01:02:45,029 --> 01:02:45,039
and running a simulation that then
 

3757
01:02:45,039 --> 01:02:47,510
and running a simulation that then
allows you to build up intuition and it

3758
01:02:47,510 --> 01:02:47,520
allows you to build up intuition and it
 

3759
01:02:47,520 --> 01:02:49,190
allows you to build up intuition and it
feels really good because you guys can

3760
01:02:49,190 --> 01:02:49,200
feels really good because you guys can
 

3761
01:02:49,200 --> 01:02:50,950
feels really good because you guys can
get some really deep and surprising

3762
01:02:50,950 --> 01:02:50,960
get some really deep and surprising
 

3763
01:02:50,960 --> 01:02:53,990
get some really deep and surprising
intuitions but how do you know

3764
01:02:53,990 --> 01:02:54,000
intuitions but how do you know
 

3765
01:02:54,000 --> 01:02:56,069
intuitions but how do you know
your models aren't the assumptions

3766
01:02:56,069 --> 01:02:56,079
your models aren't the assumptions
 

3767
01:02:56,079 --> 01:02:57,829
your models aren't the assumptions
underlying your models on some

3768
01:02:57,829 --> 01:02:57,839
underlying your models on some
 

3769
01:02:57,839 --> 01:03:00,630
underlying your models on some
fundamentally flawed and because of that

3770
01:03:00,630 --> 01:03:00,640
fundamentally flawed and because of that
 

3771
01:03:00,640 --> 01:03:02,309
fundamentally flawed and because of that
your conclusions are fundamentally

3772
01:03:02,309 --> 01:03:02,319
your conclusions are fundamentally
 

3773
01:03:02,319 --> 01:03:04,150
your conclusions are fundamentally
flawed so i guess

3774
01:03:04,150 --> 01:03:04,160
flawed so i guess
 

3775
01:03:04,160 --> 01:03:06,309
flawed so i guess
my question is what are the limits in

3776
01:03:06,309 --> 01:03:06,319
my question is what are the limits in
 

3777
01:03:06,319 --> 01:03:08,549
my question is what are the limits in
your use of game theory evolution game

3778
01:03:08,549 --> 01:03:08,559
your use of game theory evolution game
 

3779
01:03:08,559 --> 01:03:10,549
your use of game theory evolution game
theory your experience with it what are

3780
01:03:10,549 --> 01:03:10,559
theory your experience with it what are
 

3781
01:03:10,559 --> 01:03:12,309
theory your experience with it what are
the limits of game theory

3782
01:03:12,309 --> 01:03:12,319
the limits of game theory
 

3783
01:03:12,319 --> 01:03:14,630
the limits of game theory
so i've gotten some pushback from

3784
01:03:14,630 --> 01:03:14,640
so i've gotten some pushback from
 

3785
01:03:14,640 --> 01:03:16,710
so i've gotten some pushback from
professional colleagues and friends

3786
01:03:16,710 --> 01:03:16,720
professional colleagues and friends
 

3787
01:03:16,720 --> 01:03:19,349
professional colleagues and friends
who have tried to rerun simulations and

3788
01:03:19,349 --> 01:03:19,359
who have tried to rerun simulations and
 

3789
01:03:19,359 --> 01:03:21,349
who have tried to rerun simulations and
try to i mean the idea that we don't see

3790
01:03:21,349 --> 01:03:21,359
try to i mean the idea that we don't see
 

3791
01:03:21,359 --> 01:03:23,029
try to i mean the idea that we don't see
the truth is not comfortable and so many

3792
01:03:23,029 --> 01:03:23,039
the truth is not comfortable and so many
 

3793
01:03:23,039 --> 01:03:24,789
the truth is not comfortable and so many
of my colleagues are very interested in

3794
01:03:24,789 --> 01:03:24,799
of my colleagues are very interested in
 

3795
01:03:24,799 --> 01:03:26,789
of my colleagues are very interested in
trying to show that we're wrong and so

3796
01:03:26,789 --> 01:03:26,799
trying to show that we're wrong and so
 

3797
01:03:26,799 --> 01:03:28,710
trying to show that we're wrong and so
the idea would be to say that somehow we

3798
01:03:28,710 --> 01:03:28,720
the idea would be to say that somehow we
 

3799
01:03:28,720 --> 01:03:30,630
the idea would be to say that somehow we
did something as you're suggesting maybe

3800
01:03:30,630 --> 01:03:30,640
did something as you're suggesting maybe
 

3801
01:03:30,640 --> 01:03:32,470
did something as you're suggesting maybe
something special that wasn't completely

3802
01:03:32,470 --> 01:03:32,480
something special that wasn't completely
 

3803
01:03:32,480 --> 01:03:35,670
something special that wasn't completely
general um we've got some little special

3804
01:03:35,670 --> 01:03:35,680
general um we've got some little special
 

3805
01:03:35,680 --> 01:03:36,950
general um we've got some little special
part of the whole search space and

3806
01:03:36,950 --> 01:03:36,960
part of the whole search space and
 

3807
01:03:36,960 --> 01:03:38,710
part of the whole search space and
evolutionary game theory in which this

3808
01:03:38,710 --> 01:03:38,720
evolutionary game theory in which this
 

3809
01:03:38,720 --> 01:03:40,950
evolutionary game theory in which this
happens to be true but more generally

3810
01:03:40,950 --> 01:03:40,960
happens to be true but more generally
 

3811
01:03:40,960 --> 01:03:42,549
happens to be true but more generally
organisms would evolve to see the truth

3812
01:03:42,549 --> 01:03:42,559
organisms would evolve to see the truth
 

3813
01:03:42,559 --> 01:03:45,430
organisms would evolve to see the truth
so the the best

3814
01:03:45,430 --> 01:03:45,440
so the the best
 

3815
01:03:45,440 --> 01:03:47,029
so the the best
pushback we've gotten is from a team at

3816
01:03:47,029 --> 01:03:47,039
pushback we've gotten is from a team at
 

3817
01:03:47,039 --> 01:03:47,990
pushback we've gotten is from a team at
yale

3818
01:03:47,990 --> 01:03:48,000
yale
 

3819
01:03:48,000 --> 01:03:52,069
yale
and uh they suggested that um if you use

3820
01:03:52,069 --> 01:03:52,079
and uh they suggested that um if you use
 

3821
01:03:52,079 --> 01:03:54,630
and uh they suggested that um if you use
thousands of payoff functions so we in

3822
01:03:54,630 --> 01:03:54,640
thousands of payoff functions so we in
 

3823
01:03:54,640 --> 01:03:57,029
thousands of payoff functions so we in
our simulations we just use a couple

3824
01:03:57,029 --> 01:03:57,039
our simulations we just use a couple
 

3825
01:03:57,039 --> 01:03:58,630
our simulations we just use a couple
one or two

3826
01:03:58,630 --> 01:03:58,640
one or two
 

3827
01:03:58,640 --> 01:03:59,990
one or two
because it was the first simulations

3828
01:03:59,990 --> 01:04:00,000
because it was the first simulations
 

3829
01:04:00,000 --> 01:04:01,270
because it was the first simulations
right so that would be a limit we had

3830
01:04:01,270 --> 01:04:01,280
right so that would be a limit we had
 

3831
01:04:01,280 --> 01:04:02,789
right so that would be a limit we had
one or two payoff functions we showed

3832
01:04:02,789 --> 01:04:02,799
one or two payoff functions we showed
 

3833
01:04:02,799 --> 01:04:04,950
one or two payoff functions we showed
the result in those

3834
01:04:04,950 --> 01:04:04,960
the result in those
 

3835
01:04:04,960 --> 01:04:07,109
the result in those
at least for the genetic algorithms and

3836
01:04:07,109 --> 01:04:07,119
at least for the genetic algorithms and
 

3837
01:04:07,119 --> 01:04:10,390
at least for the genetic algorithms and
they said if you have 20 000 of them

3838
01:04:10,390 --> 01:04:10,400
they said if you have 20 000 of them
 

3839
01:04:10,400 --> 01:04:12,150
they said if you have 20 000 of them
then we can find these conditions in

3840
01:04:12,150 --> 01:04:12,160
then we can find these conditions in
 

3841
01:04:12,160 --> 01:04:14,150
then we can find these conditions in
which um

3842
01:04:14,150 --> 01:04:14,160
which um
 

3843
01:04:14,160 --> 01:04:16,630
which um
truth seek seeing organisms would be the

3844
01:04:16,630 --> 01:04:16,640
truth seek seeing organisms would be the
 

3845
01:04:16,640 --> 01:04:19,190
truth seek seeing organisms would be the
ones that that evolved and survived

3846
01:04:19,190 --> 01:04:19,200
ones that that evolved and survived
 

3847
01:04:19,200 --> 01:04:21,029
ones that that evolved and survived
and so we looked at their simulations

3848
01:04:21,029 --> 01:04:21,039
and so we looked at their simulations
 

3849
01:04:21,039 --> 01:04:21,829
and so we looked at their simulations
and

3850
01:04:21,829 --> 01:04:21,839
and
 

3851
01:04:21,839 --> 01:04:22,710
and
and

3852
01:04:22,710 --> 01:04:22,720
and
 

3853
01:04:22,720 --> 01:04:24,549
and
it certainly is the case that you can

3854
01:04:24,549 --> 01:04:24,559
it certainly is the case that you can
 

3855
01:04:24,559 --> 01:04:26,789
it certainly is the case that you can
find special cases in which truth can

3856
01:04:26,789 --> 01:04:26,799
find special cases in which truth can
 

3857
01:04:26,799 --> 01:04:28,630
find special cases in which truth can
evolve so when i say it's probability

3858
01:04:28,630 --> 01:04:28,640
evolve so when i say it's probability
 

3859
01:04:28,640 --> 01:04:30,470
evolve so when i say it's probability
zero it doesn't mean it can't happen it

3860
01:04:30,470 --> 01:04:30,480
zero it doesn't mean it can't happen it
 

3861
01:04:30,480 --> 01:04:31,910
zero it doesn't mean it can't happen it
can happen in fact it could happen

3862
01:04:31,910 --> 01:04:31,920
can happen in fact it could happen
 

3863
01:04:31,920 --> 01:04:33,589
can happen in fact it could happen
infinitely often it's just probability

3864
01:04:33,589 --> 01:04:33,599
infinitely often it's just probability
 

3865
01:04:33,599 --> 01:04:35,990
infinitely often it's just probability
of zero so if probability of zero things

3866
01:04:35,990 --> 01:04:36,000
of zero so if probability of zero things
 

3867
01:04:36,000 --> 01:04:38,069
of zero so if probability of zero things
can happen infinitely often

3868
01:04:38,069 --> 01:04:38,079
can happen infinitely often
 

3869
01:04:38,079 --> 01:04:39,510
can happen infinitely often
when you say probability of zero you

3870
01:04:39,510 --> 01:04:39,520
when you say probability of zero you
 

3871
01:04:39,520 --> 01:04:41,829
when you say probability of zero you
mean probability close to zero

3872
01:04:41,829 --> 01:04:41,839
mean probability close to zero
 

3873
01:04:41,839 --> 01:04:43,750
mean probability close to zero
to be very precise so for example if i

3874
01:04:43,750 --> 01:04:43,760
to be very precise so for example if i
 

3875
01:04:43,760 --> 01:04:45,990
to be very precise so for example if i
have a unit square

3876
01:04:45,990 --> 01:04:46,000
have a unit square
 

3877
01:04:46,000 --> 01:04:48,309
have a unit square
on the plane

3878
01:04:48,309 --> 01:04:48,319
on the plane
 

3879
01:04:48,319 --> 01:04:51,430
on the plane
um and i use a measure in which the um

3880
01:04:51,430 --> 01:04:51,440
um and i use a measure in which the um
 

3881
01:04:51,440 --> 01:04:54,069
um and i use a measure in which the um
on a probability measure in which the

3882
01:04:54,069 --> 01:04:54,079
on a probability measure in which the
 

3883
01:04:54,079 --> 01:04:58,230
on a probability measure in which the
area of the region is this probability

3884
01:04:58,230 --> 01:04:58,240

 

3885
01:04:58,240 --> 01:05:00,549

then if i draw a curve

3886
01:05:00,549 --> 01:05:00,559
then if i draw a curve
 

3887
01:05:00,559 --> 01:05:02,230
then if i draw a curve
in that unit square

3888
01:05:02,230 --> 01:05:02,240
in that unit square
 

3889
01:05:02,240 --> 01:05:03,430
in that unit square
it has

3890
01:05:03,430 --> 01:05:03,440
it has
 

3891
01:05:03,440 --> 01:05:05,270
it has
measure precisely zero

3892
01:05:05,270 --> 01:05:05,280
measure precisely zero
 

3893
01:05:05,280 --> 01:05:07,109
measure precisely zero
precisely not approximately precisely

3894
01:05:07,109 --> 01:05:07,119
precisely not approximately precisely
 

3895
01:05:07,119 --> 01:05:08,870
precisely not approximately precisely
zero and yet it has infinitely many

3896
01:05:08,870 --> 01:05:08,880
zero and yet it has infinitely many
 

3897
01:05:08,880 --> 01:05:09,990

points

3898
01:05:09,990 --> 01:05:10,000
points
 

3899
01:05:10,000 --> 01:05:11,349
points
so there's an object that for that

3900
01:05:11,349 --> 01:05:11,359
so there's an object that for that
 

3901
01:05:11,359 --> 01:05:12,870
so there's an object that for that
probability measure has probability of

3902
01:05:12,870 --> 01:05:12,880
probability measure has probability of
 

3903
01:05:12,880 --> 01:05:14,549
probability measure has probability of
zero and yet there's infinitely

3904
01:05:14,549 --> 01:05:14,559
zero and yet there's infinitely
 

3905
01:05:14,559 --> 01:05:16,630
zero and yet there's infinitely
infinitely many points in it so that's

3906
01:05:16,630 --> 01:05:16,640
infinitely many points in it so that's
 

3907
01:05:16,640 --> 01:05:18,630
infinitely many points in it so that's
what i what i mean when i say that the

what i what i mean when i say that the

things that are probability of zero can
happen infinitely often in principle

yeah but

and so the tools and mathematics you

3934
01:05:43,349 --> 01:05:43,359
and so the tools and mathematics you
 

3935
01:05:43,359 --> 01:05:44,950
and so the tools and mathematics you
could sort of apply the same kind of

01:06:19,349 --> 01:06:19,359
interesting so so the the issue you

raise is a very very deep one and one

raise is a very very deep one and one
 

3975
01:06:21,280 --> 01:06:22,549
raise is a very very deep one and one
that i think we should take quite

3976
01:06:22,549 --> 01:06:22,559
that i think we should take quite
 

3977
01:06:22,559 --> 01:06:23,670
that i think we should take quite

how should we think about the reality of

01:06:33,190 --> 01:06:33,200
all these
 

3987
01:06:33,200 --> 01:06:34,549
all these
all these different

01:06:34,549 --> 01:06:34,559
all these different

01:06:34,559 --> 01:06:35,829
all these different
infinities

3990
01:06:35,829 --> 01:06:35,839

versus um
 

3993
01:06:37,359 --> 01:06:38,390
versus um
just

3994
01:06:38,390 --> 01:06:38,400
just
 

3995
01:06:38,400 --> 01:06:39,910
just
um

3996
01:06:39,910 --> 01:06:39,920
um
 

3997
01:06:39,920 --> 01:06:42,150
um
a more algorithmic approach right so

3998
01:06:42,150 --> 01:06:42,160
a more algorithmic approach right so
 

3999
01:06:42,160 --> 01:06:44,630
a more algorithmic approach right so
where it's everything's computable in

4000
01:06:44,630 --> 01:06:44,640
where it's everything's computable in
 

4001
01:06:44,640 --> 01:06:46,710
where it's everything's computable in
some sense everything's finite as big as

4002
01:06:46,710 --> 01:06:46,720
some sense everything's finite as big as
 

4003
01:06:46,720 --> 01:06:48,950
some sense everything's finite as big as
you want but but but nevertheless

4004
01:06:48,950 --> 01:06:48,960
you want but but but nevertheless

01:06:48,960 --> 01:06:50,390
you want but but but nevertheless

4007
01:06:50,400 --> 01:06:52,470
finite
so yeah that ultimately boils down to

4008
01:06:52,470 --> 01:06:52,480
so yeah that ultimately boils down to
 

4009
01:06:52,480 --> 01:06:53,349
so yeah that ultimately boils down to
whether

4010
01:06:53,349 --> 01:06:53,359
whether
 

4011
01:06:53,359 --> 01:06:54,870

01:06:54,870 --> 01:06:54,880

01:06:54,880 --> 01:06:57,510
the world
is discrete or continuous in some

4017
01:06:59,200 --> 01:07:01,349
general sense
and again we can't really know but

4018
01:07:01,349 --> 01:07:01,359
and again we can't really know but
 

4019
01:07:01,359 --> 01:07:03,029
and again we can't really know but
there's just a

01:07:03,029 --> 01:07:03,039
there's just a

01:07:03,039 --> 01:07:04,549
there's just a

4023
01:07:04,559 --> 01:07:07,270

someone says here's a better
 

4083
01:08:16,319 --> 01:08:18,550
someone says here's a better
mathematical tool and here's why this is

4084
01:08:18,550 --> 01:08:18,560
mathematical tool and here's why this is
 

4085
01:08:18,560 --> 01:08:20,870
mathematical tool and here's why this is
this mathematical tool better captures

4086
01:08:20,870 --> 01:08:20,880
this mathematical tool better captures
 

4087
01:08:20,880 --> 01:08:23,110
this mathematical tool better captures
the essence of darwin's idea

4088
01:08:23,110 --> 01:08:23,120
the essence of darwin's idea
 

4089
01:08:23,120 --> 01:08:24,789

4091
01:08:24,799 --> 01:08:26,390

with evolutionary game theory there's

4092
01:08:26,390 --> 01:08:26,400
with evolutionary game theory there's
 

4093
01:08:26,400 --> 01:08:28,070
with evolutionary game theory there's
this better this thing now there are

4094
01:08:28,070 --> 01:08:28,080
this better this thing now there are
 

4095
01:08:28,080 --> 01:08:30,550
this better this thing now there are
tools like evolutionary graph theory

4096
01:08:30,550 --> 01:08:30,560
tools like evolutionary graph theory
 

4097
01:08:30,560 --> 01:08:32,229
tools like evolutionary graph theory
which generalize evolutionary game

4098
01:08:32,229 --> 01:08:32,239
which generalize evolutionary game
 

4099
01:08:32,239 --> 01:08:34,709
which generalize evolutionary game
theory and then there's quantum

4100
01:08:34,709 --> 01:08:34,719
theory and then there's quantum
 

4101
01:08:34,719 --> 01:08:39,430
theory and then there's quantum
game theory so so you can you can use uh

4102
01:08:39,430 --> 01:08:39,440
game theory so so you can you can use uh
 

4103
01:08:39,440 --> 01:08:41,829
game theory so so you can you can use uh
quantum tools like entanglement for

01:08:55,040 --> 01:08:57,349
yale is really interesting it's a really
interesting challenge of that kind of

4118
01:08:57,349 --> 01:08:57,359
interesting challenge of that kind of
 

4119
01:08:57,359 --> 01:09:00,070
interesting challenge of that kind of
of these ideas where okay if you have a

4120
01:09:00,070 --> 01:09:00,080
of these ideas where okay if you have a
 

4121
01:09:00,080 --> 01:09:01,669
of these ideas where okay if you have a
very large number of fitness functions

4122
01:09:01,669 --> 01:09:01,679
very large number of fitness functions
 

4123
01:09:01,679 --> 01:09:04,229
very large number of fitness functions
or let's say you have

4124
01:09:04,229 --> 01:09:04,239
or let's say you have
 

4125
01:09:04,239 --> 01:09:06,630
or let's say you have
a nearly infinite number of fitness

4126
01:09:06,630 --> 01:09:06,640
a nearly infinite number of fitness
 

4127
01:09:06,640 --> 01:09:08,709
a nearly infinite number of fitness
functions or a growing number of fitness

4128
01:09:08,709 --> 01:09:08,719
functions or a growing number of fitness
 

4129
01:09:08,719 --> 01:09:11,030
functions or a growing number of fitness
functions what what kind of interesting

4130
01:09:11,030 --> 01:09:11,040

4131
01:09:11,040 --> 01:09:13,110

things uh start to emerging

4132
01:09:13,110 --> 01:09:13,120
things uh start to emerging
 

4133
01:09:13,120 --> 01:09:15,590
things uh start to emerging
emerging if you are to be an organism if

4134
01:09:15,590 --> 01:09:15,600
emerging if you are to be an organism if
 

4135
01:09:15,600 --> 01:09:18,789
emerging if you are to be an organism if
to be an organism that adapts means

4136
01:09:18,789 --> 01:09:18,799
to be an organism that adapts means
 

4137
01:09:18,799 --> 01:09:21,189
to be an organism that adapts means
having to deal with an ensemble of

4138
01:09:21,189 --> 01:09:21,199
having to deal with an ensemble of
 

4139
01:09:21,199 --> 01:09:23,510
having to deal with an ensemble of
fitness functions

4140
01:09:23,510 --> 01:09:23,520
fitness functions
 

4141
01:09:23,520 --> 01:09:26,550
fitness functions
right and so we've actually redone some

4142
01:09:26,550 --> 01:09:26,560
right and so we've actually redone some
 

4143
01:09:26,560 --> 01:09:27,910
right and so we've actually redone some
of our own

4144
01:09:27,910 --> 01:09:27,920
of our own
 

4145
01:09:27,920 --> 01:09:29,590
of our own
work based on those and this is the the

4146
01:09:29,590 --> 01:09:29,600
work based on those and this is the the
 

4147
01:09:29,600 --> 01:09:31,590
work based on those and this is the the
back and forth that we expect in science

4148
01:09:31,590 --> 01:09:31,600
back and forth that we expect in science
 

4149
01:09:31,600 --> 01:09:34,470
back and forth that we expect in science
right and what we found was that they

4150
01:09:34,470 --> 01:09:34,480
right and what we found was that they
 

4151
01:09:34,480 --> 01:09:35,590
right and what we found was that they
in their

4152
01:09:35,590 --> 01:09:35,600
in their
 

4153
01:09:35,600 --> 01:09:38,149
in their
simulations they were assuming that you

4154
01:09:38,149 --> 01:09:38,159
simulations they were assuming that you
 

4155
01:09:38,159 --> 01:09:40,070
simulations they were assuming that you
couldn't carve the world up into objects

4156
01:09:40,070 --> 01:09:40,080
couldn't carve the world up into objects
 

4157
01:09:40,080 --> 01:09:42,870
couldn't carve the world up into objects
that uh and so we said well let's relax

4158
01:09:42,870 --> 01:09:42,880
that uh and so we said well let's relax
 

4159
01:09:42,880 --> 01:09:45,030
that uh and so we said well let's relax
that assumption allow organisms to

4160
01:09:45,030 --> 01:09:45,040
that assumption allow organisms to
 

4161
01:09:45,040 --> 01:09:46,229
that assumption allow organisms to
create data structures that we might

4162
01:09:46,229 --> 01:09:46,239
create data structures that we might
 

4163
01:09:46,239 --> 01:09:47,590
create data structures that we might
call objects

4164
01:09:47,590 --> 01:09:47,600
call objects
 

4165
01:09:47,600 --> 01:09:49,669
call objects
and an object would be you take you you

4166
01:09:49,669 --> 01:09:49,679
and an object would be you take you you
 

4167
01:09:49,679 --> 01:09:51,910
and an object would be you take you you
would do hierarchical clustering of your

4168
01:09:51,910 --> 01:09:51,920
would do hierarchical clustering of your
 

4169
01:09:51,920 --> 01:09:53,430
would do hierarchical clustering of your
fitness payoff functions the ones that

4170
01:09:53,430 --> 01:09:53,440
fitness payoff functions the ones that
 

4171
01:09:53,440 --> 01:09:55,990
fitness payoff functions the ones that
have similar shapes if you have 20 000

4172
01:09:55,990 --> 01:09:56,000
have similar shapes if you have 20 000
 

4173
01:09:56,000 --> 01:09:59,110
have similar shapes if you have 20 000
of them maybe these 50 are all very very

4174
01:09:59,110 --> 01:09:59,120
of them maybe these 50 are all very very
 

4175
01:09:59,120 --> 01:10:01,270
of them maybe these 50 are all very very
similar so i can take all the perception

4176
01:10:01,270 --> 01:10:01,280
similar so i can take all the perception
 

4177
01:10:01,280 --> 01:10:04,709
similar so i can take all the perception
action fitness stuff and make that into

4178
01:10:04,709 --> 01:10:04,719
action fitness stuff and make that into
 

4179
01:10:04,719 --> 01:10:06,390
action fitness stuff and make that into
a data structure and we'll call that a

4180
01:10:06,390 --> 01:10:06,400
a data structure and we'll call that a
 

4181
01:10:06,400 --> 01:10:08,149
a data structure and we'll call that a
unit or an object

4182
01:10:08,149 --> 01:10:08,159
unit or an object
 

4183
01:10:08,159 --> 01:10:09,990
unit or an object
and as soon as we did that then all of

4184
01:10:09,990 --> 01:10:10,000
and as soon as we did that then all of
 

4185
01:10:10,000 --> 01:10:11,830
and as soon as we did that then all of
their results went away it turned out

4186
01:10:11,830 --> 01:10:11,840
their results went away it turned out
 

4187
01:10:11,840 --> 01:10:14,790
their results went away it turned out
they were the special case and that the

4188
01:10:14,790 --> 01:10:14,800
they were the special case and that the
 

4189
01:10:14,800 --> 01:10:17,350
they were the special case and that the
the organisms that were allowed to only

4190
01:10:17,350 --> 01:10:17,360
the organisms that were allowed to only
 

4191
01:10:17,360 --> 01:10:19,430
the organisms that were allowed to only
see that that were

4192
01:10:19,430 --> 01:10:19,440
see that that were
 

4193
01:10:19,440 --> 01:10:21,510
see that that were
shaped to see only fitness payoffs were

4194
01:10:21,510 --> 01:10:21,520
shaped to see only fitness payoffs were
 

4195
01:10:21,520 --> 01:10:22,790
shaped to see only fitness payoffs were
the ones that were

4196
01:10:22,790 --> 01:10:22,800
the ones that were
 

4197
01:10:22,800 --> 01:10:25,350
the ones that were
so so the idea is that objects then

4198
01:10:25,350 --> 01:10:25,360
so so the idea is that objects then
 

4199
01:10:25,360 --> 01:10:26,630
so so the idea is that objects then
what are objects from an evolutionary

a different set of actions and pay and

4242
01:11:07,750 --> 01:11:07,760
a different set of actions and pay and
 

4243
01:11:07,760 --> 01:11:09,830
a different set of actions and pay and
payoffs for when i pick up a rock i'm

4244
01:11:09,830 --> 01:11:09,840
payoffs for when i pick up a rock i'm
 

4245
01:11:09,840 --> 01:11:11,830
payoffs for when i pick up a rock i'm
getting so for every object what i'm

4246
01:11:11,830 --> 01:11:11,840
getting so for every object what i'm
 

4247
01:11:11,840 --> 01:11:14,229
getting so for every object what i'm
getting is a different set of payoff

4248
01:11:14,229 --> 01:11:14,239
getting is a different set of payoff
 

4249
01:11:14,239 --> 01:11:15,590
getting is a different set of payoff
functions

4250
01:11:15,590 --> 01:11:15,600
functions
 

4251
01:11:15,600 --> 01:11:17,189
functions
um and act

4252
01:11:17,189 --> 01:11:17,199
um and act
 

4253
01:11:17,199 --> 01:11:19,350
um and act
with various actions and so once you

4254
01:11:19,350 --> 01:11:19,360
with various actions and so once you
 

4255
01:11:19,360 --> 01:11:20,630
with various actions and so once you
allow that

4256
01:11:20,630 --> 01:11:20,640
allow that
 

4257
01:11:20,640 --> 01:11:23,830
allow that
then what you find is once once again

4258
01:11:23,830 --> 01:11:23,840
then what you find is once once again
 

4259
01:11:23,840 --> 01:11:24,550
then what you find is once once again
that

4260
01:11:24,550 --> 01:11:24,560
that
 

4261
01:11:24,560 --> 01:11:26,550
that
truth goes extinct and the organisms

4262
01:11:26,550 --> 01:11:26,560
truth goes extinct and the organisms
 

4263
01:11:26,560 --> 01:11:28,390
truth goes extinct and the organisms
that just get an interface are the ones

4264
01:11:28,390 --> 01:11:28,400
that just get an interface are the ones
 

4265
01:11:28,400 --> 01:11:29,430
that just get an interface are the ones
that that win

4266
01:11:29,430 --> 01:11:29,440
that that win
 

4267
01:11:29,440 --> 01:11:31,990
that that win
but the question uh just sneaking up on

4268
01:11:31,990 --> 01:11:32,000
but the question uh just sneaking up on
 

4269
01:11:32,000 --> 01:11:34,950
but the question uh just sneaking up on
this is fascinating

4270
01:11:34,950 --> 01:11:34,960
this is fascinating
 

4271
01:11:34,960 --> 01:11:36,790
this is fascinating
from where do fitness functions

4272
01:11:36,790 --> 01:11:36,800
from where do fitness functions
 

4273
01:11:36,800 --> 01:11:38,070
from where do fitness functions
originate

4274
01:11:38,070 --> 01:11:38,080
originate
 

4275
01:11:38,080 --> 01:11:39,430
originate
what gives birth to the fitness

4276
01:11:39,430 --> 01:11:39,440
what gives birth to the fitness
 

4277
01:11:39,440 --> 01:11:41,350
what gives birth to the fitness
functions so

4278
01:11:41,350 --> 01:11:41,360
functions so
 

4279
01:11:41,360 --> 01:11:43,590
functions so
if there's a giant black box that just

4280
01:11:43,590 --> 01:11:43,600
if there's a giant black box that just
 

4281
01:11:43,600 --> 01:11:45,189
if there's a giant black box that just
keeps giving you fitness functions what

4282
01:11:45,189 --> 01:11:45,199
keeps giving you fitness functions what
 

4283
01:11:45,199 --> 01:11:46,550
keeps giving you fitness functions what
are we trying to optimize you said that

4284
01:11:46,550 --> 01:11:46,560
are we trying to optimize you said that
 

4285
01:11:46,560 --> 01:11:47,590
are we trying to optimize you said that

what are we trying to optimize and why

4298
01:11:59,510 --> 01:11:59,520
what are we trying to optimize and why
 

4299
01:11:59,520 --> 01:12:00,790
what are we trying to optimize and why
is not

4300
01:12:00,790 --> 01:12:00,800
is not
 

4301
01:12:00,800 --> 01:12:02,630

fitness functions
 

4305
01:12:05,280 --> 01:12:07,270

so each theory makes its own assumptions

4306
01:12:07,270 --> 01:12:07,280
so each theory makes its own assumptions
 

4307
01:12:07,280 --> 01:12:09,350
so each theory makes its own assumptions
and says grant me this then i'll explain

4308
01:12:09,350 --> 01:12:09,360
and says grant me this then i'll explain
 

4309
01:12:09,360 --> 01:12:10,870
and says grant me this then i'll explain
that so evolutionary game theory says

4310
01:12:10,870 --> 01:12:10,880
that so evolutionary game theory says
 

4311
01:12:10,880 --> 01:12:12,870
that so evolutionary game theory says
grant me fitness payoffs

4312
01:12:12,870 --> 01:12:12,880
grant me fitness payoffs
 

4313
01:12:12,880 --> 01:12:15,270
grant me fitness payoffs
right and grant me strategies with

4314
01:12:15,270 --> 01:12:15,280
right and grant me strategies with
 

4315
01:12:15,280 --> 01:12:17,189
right and grant me strategies with
payoffs and

4316
01:12:17,189 --> 01:12:17,199
payoffs and
 

4317
01:12:17,199 --> 01:12:18,870
payoffs and
i can write down the matrix for this

4318
01:12:18,870 --> 01:12:18,880
i can write down the matrix for this
 

4319
01:12:18,880 --> 01:12:20,229
i can write down the matrix for this
strategy interacts with that strategy

4320
01:12:20,229 --> 01:12:20,239
strategy interacts with that strategy
 

4321
01:12:20,239 --> 01:12:21,590
strategy interacts with that strategy
these are the payoffs that come up if

4322
01:12:21,590 --> 01:12:21,600
these are the payoffs that come up if
 

4323
01:12:21,600 --> 01:12:23,430
these are the payoffs that come up if
you grant me that then i can start to to

4324
01:12:23,430 --> 01:12:23,440
you grant me that then i can start to to
 

4325
01:12:23,440 --> 01:12:24,950
you grant me that then i can start to to
explain a lot of things now you can ask

4326
01:12:24,950 --> 01:12:24,960
explain a lot of things now you can ask
 

4327
01:12:24,960 --> 01:12:27,669
explain a lot of things now you can ask
for a deeper question like okay

4328
01:12:27,669 --> 01:12:27,679
for a deeper question like okay
 

4329
01:12:27,679 --> 01:12:29,910
for a deeper question like okay
how does physics

4330
01:12:29,910 --> 01:12:29,920
how does physics
 

4331
01:12:29,920 --> 01:12:31,189
how does physics
evolve

4332
01:12:31,189 --> 01:12:31,199
evolve
 

4333
01:12:31,199 --> 01:12:32,870
evolve
biology and where do these fitness

4334
01:12:32,870 --> 01:12:32,880
biology and where do these fitness
 

4335
01:12:32,880 --> 01:12:34,070
biology and where do these fitness
payoffs

4336
01:12:34,070 --> 01:12:34,080
payoffs
 

4337
01:12:34,080 --> 01:12:38,790
payoffs
come from right now

4338
01:12:38,790 --> 01:12:38,800

 

4339
01:12:38,800 --> 01:12:40,550

that would be that's a completely

4340
01:12:40,550 --> 01:12:40,560
that would be that's a completely
 

4341
01:12:40,560 --> 01:12:41,510
that would be that's a completely
different enterprise and of course

4342
01:12:41,510 --> 01:12:41,520
different enterprise and of course
 

4343
01:12:41,520 --> 01:12:43,830
different enterprise and of course
evolutionary game theory then would be

4344
01:12:43,830 --> 01:12:43,840
evolutionary game theory then would be
 

4345
01:12:43,840 --> 01:12:45,510
evolutionary game theory then would be
not the right tool for that it would

4346
01:12:45,510 --> 01:12:45,520
not the right tool for that it would
 

4347
01:12:45,520 --> 01:12:46,709
not the right tool for that it would
have to be a deeper tool that shows

4348
01:12:46,709 --> 01:12:46,719
have to be a deeper tool that shows
 

4349
01:12:46,719 --> 01:12:48,830
have to be a deeper tool that shows
where evolutionary game theory comes

4350
01:12:48,830 --> 01:12:48,840
where evolutionary game theory comes
 

4351
01:12:48,840 --> 01:12:50,550
where evolutionary game theory comes
from

4352
01:12:50,550 --> 01:12:50,560
from
 

4353
01:12:50,560 --> 01:12:52,709
from
my own take is

4354
01:12:52,709 --> 01:12:52,719
my own take is
 

4355
01:12:52,719 --> 01:12:54,149
my own take is
that

4356
01:12:54,149 --> 01:12:54,159
that
 

4357
01:12:54,159 --> 01:12:55,510
that
there's going to be a problem in doing

4358
01:12:55,510 --> 01:12:55,520
there's going to be a problem in doing
 

4359
01:12:55,520 --> 01:12:57,510
there's going to be a problem in doing
that

4360
01:12:57,510 --> 01:12:57,520
that
 

4361
01:12:57,520 --> 01:12:58,550
that
because

4362
01:12:58,550 --> 01:12:58,560
because
 

4363
01:12:58,560 --> 01:13:01,669
because
space time isn't fundamental

4364
01:13:01,669 --> 01:13:01,679
space time isn't fundamental
 

4365
01:13:01,679 --> 01:13:04,390
space time isn't fundamental
it's just a user interface

4366
01:13:04,390 --> 01:13:04,400
it's just a user interface
 

4367
01:13:04,400 --> 01:13:06,070
it's just a user interface
and that the distinction that we make

4368
01:13:06,070 --> 01:13:06,080
and that the distinction that we make
 

4369
01:13:06,080 --> 01:13:08,310
and that the distinction that we make
between living and non-living

4370
01:13:08,310 --> 01:13:08,320
between living and non-living
 

4371
01:13:08,320 --> 01:13:10,470
between living and non-living
is not a fundamental distinction

4372
01:13:10,470 --> 01:13:10,480
is not a fundamental distinction
 

4373
01:13:10,480 --> 01:13:12,390
is not a fundamental distinction
it's an artifact of the limits of our

4374
01:13:12,390 --> 01:13:12,400
it's an artifact of the limits of our
 

4375
01:13:12,400 --> 01:13:14,790
it's an artifact of the limits of our
interface

4376
01:13:14,790 --> 01:13:14,800
interface
 

4377
01:13:14,800 --> 01:13:16,470
interface
right so this is a new wrinkle and this

4378
01:13:16,470 --> 01:13:16,480
right so this is a new wrinkle and this
 

4379
01:13:16,480 --> 01:13:19,270
right so this is a new wrinkle and this
is an important wrinkle what

4380
01:13:19,270 --> 01:13:19,280
is an important wrinkle what
 

4381
01:13:19,280 --> 01:13:21,590
is an important wrinkle what
it's so nice to take space and time is

4382
01:13:21,590 --> 01:13:21,600
it's so nice to take space and time is
 

4383
01:13:21,600 --> 01:13:23,189
it's so nice to take space and time is
fundamental because if something looks

4384
01:13:23,189 --> 01:13:23,199
fundamental because if something looks
 

4385
01:13:23,199 --> 01:13:24,870
fundamental because if something looks
like it's inanimate it's inanimate and

4386
01:13:24,870 --> 01:13:24,880
like it's inanimate it's inanimate and
 

4387
01:13:24,880 --> 01:13:27,110
like it's inanimate it's inanimate and
we can just say it's it's not living

4388
01:13:27,110 --> 01:13:27,120
we can just say it's it's not living
 

4389
01:13:27,120 --> 01:13:28,870
we can just say it's it's not living
now

4390
01:13:28,870 --> 01:13:28,880
now
 

4391
01:13:28,880 --> 01:13:30,630
now
it's much more complicated

4392
01:13:30,630 --> 01:13:30,640
it's much more complicated
 

4393
01:13:30,640 --> 01:13:32,229
it's much more complicated
certain things are obviously living i'm

4394
01:13:32,229 --> 01:13:32,239
certain things are obviously living i'm
 

4395
01:13:32,239 --> 01:13:33,750
certain things are obviously living i'm
talking with you

4396
01:13:33,750 --> 01:13:33,760
talking with you
 

4397
01:13:33,760 --> 01:13:35,590
talking with you
there's i'm obviously interacting with

4398
01:13:35,590 --> 01:13:35,600
there's i'm obviously interacting with
 

4399
01:13:35,600 --> 01:13:37,270
there's i'm obviously interacting with
some something that's alive and

4400
01:13:37,270 --> 01:13:37,280
some something that's alive and
 

4401
01:13:37,280 --> 01:13:38,470
some something that's alive and
conscious

4402
01:13:38,470 --> 01:13:38,480
conscious
 

4403
01:13:38,480 --> 01:13:39,910
conscious
i think we've let go of the word

4404
01:13:39,910 --> 01:13:39,920
i think we've let go of the word
 

4405
01:13:39,920 --> 01:13:42,229
i think we've let go of the word
obviously in this conversation i think

01:13:42,229 --> 01:13:42,239
obviously in this conversation i think
 

4407
01:13:42,239 --> 01:13:43,669
obviously in this conversation i think
nothing is obvious this is obvious

4408
01:13:43,669 --> 01:13:43,679
nothing is obvious this is obvious
 

4409
01:13:43,679 --> 01:13:45,110
nothing is obvious this is obvious
that's right

4410
01:13:45,110 --> 01:13:45,120
that's right
 

4411
01:13:45,120 --> 01:13:46,950
that's right
but when we get down to you to like you

4412
01:13:46,950 --> 01:13:46,960
but when we get down to you to like you
 

4413
01:13:46,960 --> 01:13:47,669
but when we get down to you to like you
know

4414
01:13:47,669 --> 01:13:47,679
know
 

4415
01:13:47,679 --> 01:13:50,630
know
an ant it's obviously living but i'll

4416
01:13:50,630 --> 01:13:50,640
an ant it's obviously living but i'll
 

4417
01:13:50,640 --> 01:13:52,630
an ant it's obviously living but i'll
say it it appears to be living it won't

4418
01:13:52,630 --> 01:13:52,640
say it it appears to be living it won't
 

4419
01:13:52,640 --> 01:13:55,430
say it it appears to be living it won't
get down to a virus now people wonder

4420
01:13:55,430 --> 01:13:55,440
get down to a virus now people wonder
 

4421
01:13:55,440 --> 01:13:57,110
get down to a virus now people wonder
and when we get down to you know protons

4422
01:13:57,110 --> 01:13:57,120
and when we get down to you know protons
 

4423
01:13:57,120 --> 01:13:59,590
and when we get down to you know protons
people say it's not living and and my

4424
01:13:59,590 --> 01:13:59,600
people say it's not living and and my
 

4425
01:13:59,600 --> 01:14:02,550
people say it's not living and and my
attitude is look i have a user interface

4426
01:14:02,550 --> 01:14:02,560
attitude is look i have a user interface
 

4427
01:14:02,560 --> 01:14:04,390
attitude is look i have a user interface
the interface is there to hide certain

4428
01:14:04,390 --> 01:14:04,400
the interface is there to hide certain
 

4429
01:14:04,400 --> 01:14:07,510
the interface is there to hide certain
aspects of reality and others to to

4430
01:14:07,510 --> 01:14:07,520
aspects of reality and others to to
 

4431
01:14:07,520 --> 01:14:09,110
aspects of reality and others to to
to

4432
01:14:09,110 --> 01:14:09,120
to
 

4433
01:14:09,120 --> 01:14:11,189
to
it's an uneven representation put it

4434
01:14:11,189 --> 01:14:11,199
it's an uneven representation put it
 

4435
01:14:11,199 --> 01:14:13,030
it's an uneven representation put it
that way certain things just get

4436
01:14:13,030 --> 01:14:13,040
that way certain things just get
 

4437
01:14:13,040 --> 01:14:14,790
that way certain things just get
completely hidden

4438
01:14:14,790 --> 01:14:14,800
completely hidden
 

4439
01:14:14,800 --> 01:14:17,910
completely hidden
dark matter and dark energy are most of

4440
01:14:17,910 --> 01:14:17,920
dark matter and dark energy are most of
 

4441
01:14:17,920 --> 01:14:19,750
dark matter and dark energy are most of
the energy and matter that's out there

4442
01:14:19,750 --> 01:14:19,760
the energy and matter that's out there
 

4443
01:14:19,760 --> 01:14:21,750
the energy and matter that's out there
our interface just plain flat out hides

4444
01:14:21,750 --> 01:14:21,760
our interface just plain flat out hides
 

4445
01:14:21,760 --> 01:14:23,189
our interface just plain flat out hides
them

4446
01:14:23,189 --> 01:14:23,199
them
 

4447
01:14:23,199 --> 01:14:25,430
them
the only way we get some hint is because

4448
01:14:25,430 --> 01:14:25,440
the only way we get some hint is because
 

4449
01:14:25,440 --> 01:14:27,510
the only way we get some hint is because
gravitational things are going wrong

4450
01:14:27,510 --> 01:14:27,520
gravitational things are going wrong
 

4451
01:14:27,520 --> 01:14:28,630
gravitational things are going wrong
within our

4452
01:14:28,630 --> 01:14:28,640
within our
 

4453
01:14:28,640 --> 01:14:31,030
within our
so so most things are outside of our of

4454
01:14:31,030 --> 01:14:31,040
so so most things are outside of our of
 

4455
01:14:31,040 --> 01:14:32,790
so so most things are outside of our of
our interface the distinction between

4456
01:14:32,790 --> 01:14:32,800
our interface the distinction between
 

4457
01:14:32,800 --> 01:14:35,030
our interface the distinction between
living and non-living

4458
01:14:35,030 --> 01:14:35,040
living and non-living
 

4459
01:14:35,040 --> 01:14:36,470
living and non-living
is not fundamental it's an artifact of

4460
01:14:36,470 --> 01:14:36,480
is not fundamental it's an artifact of
 

4461
01:14:36,480 --> 01:14:39,350
is not fundamental it's an artifact of
our interface so if so this is the if we

4462
01:14:39,350 --> 01:14:39,360
our interface so if so this is the if we
 

4463
01:14:39,360 --> 01:14:40,870
our interface so if so this is the if we
really

4464
01:14:40,870 --> 01:14:40,880
really
 

4465
01:14:40,880 --> 01:14:41,830
really
really want to understand where

4466
01:14:41,830 --> 01:14:41,840
really want to understand where
 

4467
01:14:41,840 --> 01:14:44,550
really want to understand where
evolution comes from

4468
01:14:44,550 --> 01:14:44,560
evolution comes from
 

4469
01:14:44,560 --> 01:14:45,910
evolution comes from
to answer the question the deep question

4470
01:14:45,910 --> 01:14:45,920
to answer the question the deep question
 

4471
01:14:45,920 --> 01:14:47,590
to answer the question the deep question
you asked i think the the right way

4472
01:14:47,590 --> 01:14:47,600
you asked i think the the right way
 

4473
01:14:47,600 --> 01:14:48,950
you asked i think the the right way
we're going to do that is to come up

4474
01:14:48,950 --> 01:14:48,960
we're going to do that is to come up
 

4475
01:14:48,960 --> 01:14:51,990
we're going to do that is to come up
with a deeper theory than space time

4476
01:14:51,990 --> 01:14:52,000
with a deeper theory than space time
 

4477
01:14:52,000 --> 01:14:53,430
with a deeper theory than space time
in which there may not be the notion of

4478
01:14:53,430 --> 01:14:53,440
in which there may not be the notion of
 

4479
01:14:53,440 --> 01:14:55,750
in which there may not be the notion of
time

4480
01:14:55,750 --> 01:14:55,760

 

4481
01:14:55,760 --> 01:14:56,709

and

4482
01:14:56,709 --> 01:14:56,719
and
 

4483
01:14:56,719 --> 01:14:57,669
and
show that

4484
01:14:57,669 --> 01:14:57,679
show that
 

4485
01:14:57,679 --> 01:14:59,990
show that
whatever this dynamics of that deeper

4486
01:14:59,990 --> 01:15:00,000
whatever this dynamics of that deeper
 

4487
01:15:00,000 --> 01:15:01,830
whatever this dynamics of that deeper
theory is

4488
01:15:01,830 --> 01:15:01,840
theory is
 

4489
01:15:01,840 --> 01:15:03,110
theory is
and by the way i'll talk about how you

4490
01:15:03,110 --> 01:15:03,120
and by the way i'll talk about how you
 

4491
01:15:03,120 --> 01:15:04,950
and by the way i'll talk about how you
could have dynamics without time but the

4492
01:15:04,950 --> 01:15:04,960
could have dynamics without time but the
 

4493
01:15:04,960 --> 01:15:07,189
could have dynamics without time but the
the dynamics of this deeper theory when

4494
01:15:07,189 --> 01:15:07,199
the dynamics of this deeper theory when
 

4495
01:15:07,199 --> 01:15:09,910
the dynamics of this deeper theory when
we project it into

4496
01:15:09,910 --> 01:15:09,920
we project it into
 

4497
01:15:09,920 --> 01:15:11,830
we project it into
in certain ways then we do get space

4498
01:15:11,830 --> 01:15:11,840
in certain ways then we do get space
 

4499
01:15:11,840 --> 01:15:13,189
in certain ways then we do get space
time and we get what appears to be

4500
01:15:13,189 --> 01:15:13,199
time and we get what appears to be
 

4501
01:15:13,199 --> 01:15:15,110
time and we get what appears to be
evolution by natural selection so i

4502
01:15:15,110 --> 01:15:15,120
evolution by natural selection so i
 

4503
01:15:15,120 --> 01:15:16,790
evolution by natural selection so i
would love to see evolution by natural

4504
01:15:16,790 --> 01:15:16,800
would love to see evolution by natural
 

4505
01:15:16,800 --> 01:15:19,189
would love to see evolution by natural
selection nature red and tooth and claw

4506
01:15:19,189 --> 01:15:19,199
selection nature red and tooth and claw
 

4507
01:15:19,199 --> 01:15:20,870

people fighting and animals fighting for

4508
01:15:20,870 --> 01:15:20,880
people fighting and animals fighting for
 

4509
01:15:20,880 --> 01:15:22,550
people fighting and animals fighting for
resources and a whole bit come out of a

4510
01:15:22,550 --> 01:15:22,560
resources and a whole bit come out of a
 

4511
01:15:22,560 --> 01:15:24,470
resources and a whole bit come out of a
deeper theory which perhaps it's all

4512
01:15:24,470 --> 01:15:24,480
deeper theory which perhaps it's all
 

4513
01:15:24,480 --> 01:15:26,630
deeper theory which perhaps it's all
cooperation there's no no limited

4514
01:15:26,630 --> 01:15:26,640
cooperation there's no no limited
 

4515
01:15:26,640 --> 01:15:29,030
cooperation there's no no limited
resources and so forth but as a result

4516
01:15:29,030 --> 01:15:29,040
resources and so forth but as a result
 

4517
01:15:29,040 --> 01:15:30,550
resources and so forth but as a result
of projection

4518
01:15:30,550 --> 01:15:30,560
of projection
 

4519
01:15:30,560 --> 01:15:32,790
of projection
you get space and time and as a result

4520
01:15:32,790 --> 01:15:32,800
you get space and time and as a result
 

4521
01:15:32,800 --> 01:15:34,390
you get space and time and as a result
of projection you get nature red and

4522
01:15:34,390 --> 01:15:34,400
of projection you get nature red and
 

4523
01:15:34,400 --> 01:15:36,470
of projection you get nature red and
tooth and claw the appearance of it but

4524
01:15:36,470 --> 01:15:36,480
tooth and claw the appearance of it but
 

4525
01:15:36,480 --> 01:15:39,189
tooth and claw the appearance of it but
it's all an artifact of the interface i

4526
01:15:39,189 --> 01:15:39,199
it's all an artifact of the interface i
 

4527
01:15:39,199 --> 01:15:41,110
it's all an artifact of the interface i
like this idea

4528
01:15:41,110 --> 01:15:41,120
like this idea
 

4529
01:15:41,120 --> 01:15:43,270
like this idea
that uh the line between living and

4530
01:15:43,270 --> 01:15:43,280
that uh the line between living and
 

4531
01:15:43,280 --> 01:15:46,390
that uh the line between living and
non-living is very important

4532
01:15:46,390 --> 01:15:46,400
non-living is very important
 

4533
01:15:46,400 --> 01:15:47,830
non-living is very important
because that's that's the thing that

4534
01:15:47,830 --> 01:15:47,840
because that's that's the thing that
 

4535
01:15:47,840 --> 01:15:50,870
because that's that's the thing that
would emerge before you have evolution

4536
01:15:50,870 --> 01:15:50,880
would emerge before you have evolution
 

4537
01:15:50,880 --> 01:15:55,189
would emerge before you have evolution
the idea of death

4538
01:15:55,189 --> 01:15:55,199

 

4539
01:15:55,199 --> 01:15:56,709

so

4540
01:15:56,709 --> 01:15:56,719
so
 

4541
01:15:56,719 --> 01:15:58,709
so
that seems to be an important component

4542
01:15:58,709 --> 01:15:58,719
that seems to be an important component
 

4543
01:15:58,719 --> 01:16:00,390
that seems to be an important component
of natural selection if and if that

4544
01:16:00,390 --> 01:16:00,400
of natural selection if and if that
 

4545
01:16:00,400 --> 01:16:02,790
of natural selection if and if that
emerged because that's also

4546
01:16:02,790 --> 01:16:02,800
emerged because that's also
 

4547
01:16:02,800 --> 01:16:04,070
emerged because that's also
um

4548
01:16:04,070 --> 01:16:04,080
um
 

4549
01:16:04,080 --> 01:16:05,669
um
you know asking the question i guess

4550
01:16:05,669 --> 01:16:05,679
you know asking the question i guess
 

4551
01:16:05,679 --> 01:16:07,830
you know asking the question i guess
that i asked where do fitness come

4552
01:16:07,830 --> 01:16:07,840
that i asked where do fitness come
 

4553
01:16:07,840 --> 01:16:09,430
that i asked where do fitness come
fitness functions come from that's like

4554
01:16:09,430 --> 01:16:09,440
fitness functions come from that's like
 

4555
01:16:09,440 --> 01:16:10,709
fitness functions come from that's like
asking

4556
01:16:10,709 --> 01:16:10,719
asking
 

4557
01:16:10,719 --> 01:16:12,550
asking
the the old meaning of life question

4558
01:16:12,550 --> 01:16:12,560
the the old meaning of life question
 

4559
01:16:12,560 --> 01:16:16,070
the the old meaning of life question
right it's a what's the why why

4560
01:16:16,070 --> 01:16:16,080
right it's a what's the why why
 

4561
01:16:16,080 --> 01:16:17,430
right it's a what's the why why
why

4562
01:16:17,430 --> 01:16:17,440
why
 

4563
01:16:17,440 --> 01:16:18,390
why
and

4564
01:16:18,390 --> 01:16:18,400
and
 

4565
01:16:18,400 --> 01:16:20,550
and
one of the big underlying lies okay you

4566
01:16:20,550 --> 01:16:20,560
one of the big underlying lies okay you
 

4567
01:16:20,560 --> 01:16:23,030
one of the big underlying lies okay you
can start with evolution on earth but

4568
01:16:23,030 --> 01:16:23,040
can start with evolution on earth but
 

4569
01:16:23,040 --> 01:16:24,790
can start with evolution on earth but
without living

4570
01:16:24,790 --> 01:16:24,800
without living
 

4571
01:16:24,800 --> 01:16:26,709
without living
without life and death without the line

4572
01:16:26,709 --> 01:16:26,719
without life and death without the line
 

4573
01:16:26,719 --> 01:16:28,550
without life and death without the line
between the living and the dead

4574
01:16:28,550 --> 01:16:28,560
between the living and the dead
 

4575
01:16:28,560 --> 01:16:30,310
between the living and the dead
you don't have evolution

4576
01:16:30,310 --> 01:16:30,320
you don't have evolution
 

4577
01:16:30,320 --> 01:16:32,229
you don't have evolution
so what if underneath it there's no such

4578
01:16:32,229 --> 01:16:32,239
so what if underneath it there's no such
 

4579
01:16:32,239 --> 01:16:34,870
so what if underneath it there's no such
thing as the living and the dead

4580
01:16:34,870 --> 01:16:34,880
thing as the living and the dead
 

4581
01:16:34,880 --> 01:16:36,390
thing as the living and the dead
there's no

4582
01:16:36,390 --> 01:16:36,400
there's no
 

4583
01:16:36,400 --> 01:16:39,350
there's no
like this concept of an organism period

4584
01:16:39,350 --> 01:16:39,360
like this concept of an organism period
 

4585
01:16:39,360 --> 01:16:42,630
like this concept of an organism period
there's a living organism that's defined

4586
01:16:42,630 --> 01:16:42,640
there's a living organism that's defined
 

4587
01:16:42,640 --> 01:16:45,830
there's a living organism that's defined
by a volume in space-time

4588
01:16:45,830 --> 01:16:45,840
by a volume in space-time
 

4589
01:16:45,840 --> 01:16:48,390
by a volume in space-time
that somehow interacts

4590
01:16:48,390 --> 01:16:48,400
that somehow interacts
 

4591
01:16:48,400 --> 01:16:51,350
that somehow interacts
that over time maintains its integrity

4592
01:16:51,350 --> 01:16:51,360
that over time maintains its integrity
 

4593
01:16:51,360 --> 01:16:52,870
that over time maintains its integrity
somehow

4594
01:16:52,870 --> 01:16:52,880
somehow
 

4595
01:16:52,880 --> 01:16:54,870
somehow
it has some kind of history it has a

4596
01:16:54,870 --> 01:16:54,880
it has some kind of history it has a
 

4597
01:16:54,880 --> 01:16:57,669
it has some kind of history it has a
wall of some kind the outside world the

4598
01:16:57,669 --> 01:16:57,679
wall of some kind the outside world the
 

4599
01:16:57,679 --> 01:16:59,430
wall of some kind the outside world the
environment and then inside there's an

4600
01:16:59,430 --> 01:16:59,440
environment and then inside there's an
 

4601
01:16:59,440 --> 01:17:00,630
environment and then inside there's an
organism

4602
01:17:00,630 --> 01:17:00,640
organism
 

4603
01:17:00,640 --> 01:17:03,590
organism
so you're defining an organism and also

4604
01:17:03,590 --> 01:17:03,600
so you're defining an organism and also
 

4605
01:17:03,600 --> 01:17:05,030
so you're defining an organism and also
you're defining that organism by the

4606
01:17:05,030 --> 01:17:05,040
you're defining that organism by the
 

4607
01:17:05,040 --> 01:17:07,270
you're defining that organism by the
fact that it can move

4608
01:17:07,270 --> 01:17:07,280
fact that it can move
 

4609
01:17:07,280 --> 01:17:10,550
fact that it can move
and it can be come alive which you kind

4610
01:17:10,550 --> 01:17:10,560
and it can be come alive which you kind
 

4611
01:17:10,560 --> 01:17:12,950
and it can be come alive which you kind
of think of as moving

4612
01:17:12,950 --> 01:17:12,960
of think of as moving
 

4613
01:17:12,960 --> 01:17:14,310
of think of as moving
combined with the fact that it's keeping

4614
01:17:14,310 --> 01:17:14,320
combined with the fact that it's keeping
 

4615
01:17:14,320 --> 01:17:15,910
combined with the fact that it's keeping
itself separate from the environment so

4616
01:17:15,910 --> 01:17:15,920
itself separate from the environment so
 

4617
01:17:15,920 --> 01:17:17,910
itself separate from the environment so
you can point out that thing is living

4618
01:17:17,910 --> 01:17:17,920
you can point out that thing is living
 

4619
01:17:17,920 --> 01:17:20,950
you can point out that thing is living
and then it can also die

4620
01:17:20,950 --> 01:17:20,960
and then it can also die
 

4621
01:17:20,960 --> 01:17:23,669
and then it can also die
that seems to be of all very

4622
01:17:23,669 --> 01:17:23,679
that seems to be of all very
 

4623
01:17:23,679 --> 01:17:26,550
that seems to be of all very
powerful components of space time that

4624
01:17:26,550 --> 01:17:26,560
powerful components of space time that
 

4625
01:17:26,560 --> 01:17:28,550
powerful components of space time that
enable you to have something like

4626
01:17:28,550 --> 01:17:28,560
enable you to have something like
 

4627
01:17:28,560 --> 01:17:31,510
enable you to have something like
natural selection and evolution

4628
01:17:31,510 --> 01:17:31,520
natural selection and evolution
 

4629
01:17:31,520 --> 01:17:32,870
natural selection and evolution
well and there's a lot of interesting

4630
01:17:32,870 --> 01:17:32,880
well and there's a lot of interesting
 

4631
01:17:32,880 --> 01:17:34,790
well and there's a lot of interesting
work some of it um by collaborators of

4632
01:17:34,790 --> 01:17:34,800
work some of it um by collaborators of
 

4633
01:17:34,800 --> 01:17:37,030
work some of it um by collaborators of
carl fristen and others where they

4634
01:17:37,030 --> 01:17:37,040
carl fristen and others where they
 

4635
01:17:37,040 --> 01:17:39,270
carl fristen and others where they
they have um

4636
01:17:39,270 --> 01:17:39,280
they have um
 

4637
01:17:39,280 --> 01:17:41,430
they have um
bayes net kind of stuff that they built

4638
01:17:41,430 --> 01:17:41,440
bayes net kind of stuff that they built
 

4639
01:17:41,440 --> 01:17:43,830
bayes net kind of stuff that they built
on in the notion of a markov blanket so

4640
01:17:43,830 --> 01:17:43,840
on in the notion of a markov blanket so
 

4641
01:17:43,840 --> 01:17:45,910
on in the notion of a markov blanket so
you have some states

4642
01:17:45,910 --> 01:17:45,920
you have some states
 

4643
01:17:45,920 --> 01:17:47,830
you have some states
within this network that are inside the

4644
01:17:47,830 --> 01:17:47,840
within this network that are inside the
 

4645
01:17:47,840 --> 01:17:49,030
within this network that are inside the
blanket then you have the blanket and

4646
01:17:49,030 --> 01:17:49,040
blanket then you have the blanket and
 

4647
01:17:49,040 --> 01:17:50,950
blanket then you have the blanket and
then the state's outside the blanket and

4648
01:17:50,950 --> 01:17:50,960
then the state's outside the blanket and
 

4649
01:17:50,960 --> 01:17:52,870
then the state's outside the blanket and
the states inside this markov blanket

4650
01:17:52,870 --> 01:17:52,880
the states inside this markov blanket
 

4651
01:17:52,880 --> 01:17:53,910
the states inside this markov blanket
are conditionally independent of the

4652
01:17:53,910 --> 01:17:53,920
are conditionally independent of the
 

4653
01:17:53,920 --> 01:17:55,830
are conditionally independent of the
states outside the blank blanket

4654
01:17:55,830 --> 01:17:55,840
states outside the blank blanket
 

4655
01:17:55,840 --> 01:17:58,229
states outside the blank blanket
conditioned on the blanket and what

4656
01:17:58,229 --> 01:17:58,239
conditioned on the blanket and what
 

4657
01:17:58,239 --> 01:18:00,149
conditioned on the blanket and what
they're what they're looking at is that

4658
01:18:00,149 --> 01:18:00,159
they're what they're looking at is that
 

4659
01:18:00,159 --> 01:18:02,870
they're what they're looking at is that
the dynamics inside of the states inside

4660
01:18:02,870 --> 01:18:02,880
the dynamics inside of the states inside
 

4661
01:18:02,880 --> 01:18:05,270
the dynamics inside of the states inside
the markel blanket seem to be trying to

4662
01:18:05,270 --> 01:18:05,280
the markel blanket seem to be trying to
 

4663
01:18:05,280 --> 01:18:07,430
the markel blanket seem to be trying to
estimate properties of the outside and

4664
01:18:07,430 --> 01:18:07,440
estimate properties of the outside and
 

4665
01:18:07,440 --> 01:18:09,350
estimate properties of the outside and
and react to them in a way so it seems

4666
01:18:09,350 --> 01:18:09,360
and react to them in a way so it seems
 

4667
01:18:09,360 --> 01:18:10,709
and react to them in a way so it seems
like you're doing probabilistic

4668
01:18:10,709 --> 01:18:10,719
like you're doing probabilistic
 

4669
01:18:10,719 --> 01:18:13,510
like you're doing probabilistic
inferences in ways that might be able to

4670
01:18:13,510 --> 01:18:13,520
inferences in ways that might be able to
 

4671
01:18:13,520 --> 01:18:15,270
inferences in ways that might be able to
to keep your life so there's interesting

4672
01:18:15,270 --> 01:18:15,280
to keep your life so there's interesting
 

4673
01:18:15,280 --> 01:18:17,750
to keep your life so there's interesting
work going on in in that direction but

4674
01:18:17,750 --> 01:18:17,760
work going on in in that direction but
 

4675
01:18:17,760 --> 01:18:18,630
work going on in in that direction but
but but

4676
01:18:18,630 --> 01:18:18,640
but but
 

4677
01:18:18,640 --> 01:18:21,110
but but
what i'm saying is is something slightly

4678
01:18:21,110 --> 01:18:21,120
what i'm saying is is something slightly
 

4679
01:18:21,120 --> 01:18:22,709
what i'm saying is is something slightly
different and that is

4680
01:18:22,709 --> 01:18:22,719
different and that is
 

4681
01:18:22,719 --> 01:18:24,630
different and that is
like when i when i look at you

4682
01:18:24,630 --> 01:18:24,640
like when i when i look at you
 

4683
01:18:24,640 --> 01:18:26,229
like when i when i look at you
all i see is skin hair and eyes right

4684
01:18:26,229 --> 01:18:26,239
all i see is skin hair and eyes right
 

4685
01:18:26,239 --> 01:18:27,350
all i see is skin hair and eyes right
that's all i see

4686
01:18:27,350 --> 01:18:27,360
that's all i see
 

4687
01:18:27,360 --> 01:18:29,750
that's all i see
but

4688
01:18:29,750 --> 01:18:29,760

 

4689
01:18:29,760 --> 01:18:31,110

i know that there's a deeper reality i

4690
01:18:31,110 --> 01:18:31,120
i know that there's a deeper reality i
 

4691
01:18:31,120 --> 01:18:32,149
i know that there's a deeper reality i
believe that there's a much deeper

4692
01:18:32,149 --> 01:18:32,159
believe that there's a much deeper
 

4693
01:18:32,159 --> 01:18:33,590
believe that there's a much deeper
reality there's the whole world of your

4694
01:18:33,590 --> 01:18:33,600
reality there's the whole world of your
 

4695
01:18:33,600 --> 01:18:34,870
reality there's the whole world of your
experiences your thoughts your hopes

4696
01:18:34,870 --> 01:18:34,880
experiences your thoughts your hopes
 

4697
01:18:34,880 --> 01:18:35,910
experiences your thoughts your hopes
your dreams

4698
01:18:35,910 --> 01:18:35,920
your dreams
 

4699
01:18:35,920 --> 01:18:38,830
your dreams
in some sense the face that i see

4700
01:18:38,830 --> 01:18:38,840
in some sense the face that i see
 

4701
01:18:38,840 --> 01:18:41,990
in some sense the face that i see
is is just a symbol that i create right

4702
01:18:41,990 --> 01:18:42,000
is is just a symbol that i create right
 

4703
01:18:42,000 --> 01:18:44,070
is is just a symbol that i create right
and as soon as i look away that i delete

4704
01:18:44,070 --> 01:18:44,080
and as soon as i look away that i delete
 

4705
01:18:44,080 --> 01:18:46,310
and as soon as i look away that i delete
that symbol but i don't delete you i

4706
01:18:46,310 --> 01:18:46,320
that symbol but i don't delete you i
 

4707
01:18:46,320 --> 01:18:48,390
that symbol but i don't delete you i
don't delete the conscious experience

4708
01:18:48,390 --> 01:18:48,400
don't delete the conscious experience
 

4709
01:18:48,400 --> 01:18:51,030
don't delete the conscious experience
the the whole world of your so i i'm

4710
01:18:51,030 --> 01:18:51,040
the the whole world of your so i i'm
 

4711
01:18:51,040 --> 01:18:53,430
the the whole world of your so i i'm
only deleting an interface symbol but

4712
01:18:53,430 --> 01:18:53,440
only deleting an interface symbol but
 

4713
01:18:53,440 --> 01:18:55,990
only deleting an interface symbol but
that interface symbol

4714
01:18:55,990 --> 01:18:56,000
that interface symbol
 

4715
01:18:56,000 --> 01:18:57,669
that interface symbol
is a

4716
01:18:57,669 --> 01:18:57,679
is a
 

4717
01:18:57,679 --> 01:19:00,790
is a
portal so to speak

4718
01:19:00,790 --> 01:19:00,800
portal so to speak
 

4719
01:19:00,800 --> 01:19:01,830
portal so to speak
not a

not a

01:19:01,840 --> 01:19:03,430
not a
perfect portal but

4722
01:19:03,430 --> 01:19:03,440
perfect portal but
 

4723
01:19:03,440 --> 01:19:05,350
perfect portal but
a genuine portal into your beliefs into

a genuine portal into your beliefs into
 

4725
01:19:05,360 --> 01:19:07,270
a genuine portal into your beliefs into

4730
01:19:10,790 --> 01:19:10,800
genuinely but your consciousness is
 

4731
01:19:10,800 --> 01:19:12,470

genuinely affecting mine and mine is
 

4733
01:19:12,480 --> 01:19:15,030

genuinely affecting yours through these

icons which which i create on the fly i

4736
01:19:17,750 --> 01:19:17,760
icons which which i create on the fly i
 

4737
01:19:17,760 --> 01:19:19,350
icons which which i create on the fly i
mean i create your face when i look i

4738
01:19:19,350 --> 01:19:19,360
mean i create your face when i look i
 

4739
01:19:19,360 --> 01:19:21,270
mean i create your face when i look i
delete it i don't create you your

4740
01:19:21,270 --> 01:19:21,280
delete it i don't create you your
 

4741
01:19:21,280 --> 01:19:23,510
delete it i don't create you your
consciousness that's there all the time

4742
01:19:23,510 --> 01:19:23,520
consciousness that's there all the time
 

4743
01:19:23,520 --> 01:19:25,910
consciousness that's there all the time
um but but i do so

4744
01:19:25,910 --> 01:19:25,920
um but but i do so
 

4745
01:19:25,920 --> 01:19:27,910
um but but i do so
now when i look at a cat i'm creating

4746
01:19:27,910 --> 01:19:27,920
now when i look at a cat i'm creating
 

4747
01:19:27,920 --> 01:19:30,229
now when i look at a cat i'm creating
something that i still call living and i

4748
01:19:30,229 --> 01:19:30,239
something that i still call living and i
 

4749
01:19:30,239 --> 01:19:32,229
something that i still call living and i
still think it's conscious when i look

4750
01:19:32,229 --> 01:19:32,239
still think it's conscious when i look
 

4751
01:19:32,239 --> 01:19:33,750
still think it's conscious when i look
at an ant

4752
01:19:33,750 --> 01:19:33,760
at an ant
 

4753
01:19:33,760 --> 01:19:35,590
at an ant
i create something that i still would

4754
01:19:35,590 --> 01:19:35,600
i create something that i still would
 

4755
01:19:35,600 --> 01:19:38,149
i create something that i still would
call living but maybe not conscious when

4756
01:19:38,149 --> 01:19:38,159
call living but maybe not conscious when
 

4757
01:19:38,159 --> 01:19:40,790
call living but maybe not conscious when
i look at something i call a virus now

4758
01:19:40,790 --> 01:19:40,800
i look at something i call a virus now
 

4759
01:19:40,800 --> 01:19:42,950
i look at something i call a virus now
i'm not even sure i would call it living

4760
01:19:42,950 --> 01:19:42,960
i'm not even sure i would call it living
 

4761
01:19:42,960 --> 01:19:45,350
i'm not even sure i would call it living
and when i look at a proton i would say

4762
01:19:45,350 --> 01:19:45,360
and when i look at a proton i would say
 

4763
01:19:45,360 --> 01:19:48,870
and when i look at a proton i would say
i don't even think it's not alive at all

4764
01:19:48,870 --> 01:19:48,880
i don't even think it's not alive at all
 

4765
01:19:48,880 --> 01:19:50,790
i don't even think it's not alive at all
it could be

i'm not saying a proton is conscious
 

4827
01:20:49,120 --> 01:20:50,390
i'm not saying a proton is conscious
just like i'm not saying your face is

4828
01:20:50,390 --> 01:20:50,400
just like i'm not saying your face is
 

4829
01:20:50,400 --> 01:20:53,189
just like i'm not saying your face is
conscious your face is a symbol i create

4830
01:20:53,189 --> 01:20:53,199
conscious your face is a symbol i create
 

4831
01:20:53,199 --> 01:20:55,030
conscious your face is a symbol i create
and then delete

4832

and then delete
 

4833
01:20:55,040 --> 01:20:56,790

as i look and so your face is not
 

4835
01:20:56,800 --> 01:20:58,709

conscious but i know that that face in

my interface the lex friedman face that

my interface the lex friedman face that
 

4839
01:21:01,199 --> 01:21:03,270
my interface the lex friedman face that
i create is an interface symbol that's a

4840
01:21:03,270 --> 01:21:03,280
i create is an interface symbol that's a
 

4841
01:21:03,280 --> 01:21:05,910
i create is an interface symbol that's a
genuine portal into your consciousness

4842

genuine portal into your consciousness
 

4843
01:21:05,920 --> 01:21:07,510
genuine portal into your consciousness
the portal is

4844
01:21:07,510 --> 01:21:07,520
the portal is
 

4845
01:21:07,520 --> 01:21:11,030
the portal is
less clear for a cat even less clear for

less clear for a cat even less clear for
 

4847
01:21:11,040 --> 01:21:12,870
less clear for a cat even less clear for
an ant and by the time we get down to a

proton the portal is not clear at all

proton the portal is not clear at all
 

4851
01:21:15,679 --> 01:21:16,629
proton the portal is not clear at all
but that doesn't mean i'm not

4852
01:21:16,629 --> 01:21:16,639
but that doesn't mean i'm not
 

4853
01:21:16,639 --> 01:21:17,910
but that doesn't mean i'm not
interacting with consciousness it just

4854
01:21:17,910 --> 01:21:17,920
interacting with consciousness it just
 

4855
01:21:17,920 --> 01:21:19,990
interacting with consciousness it just
means my interface gave up

4856
01:21:19,990 --> 01:21:20,000
means my interface gave up
 

4857
01:21:20,000 --> 01:21:21,910
means my interface gave up
and there's some some deeper reality

4858
01:21:21,910 --> 01:21:21,920
and there's some some deeper reality
 

4859
01:21:21,920 --> 01:21:24,229
and there's some some deeper reality
that we have to go after so so that so

so it's this portal unconscious i wonder

01:21:30,960 --> 01:21:31,750
so it's this portal unconscious i wonder
why

why

01:21:51,990 --> 01:21:52,000
create portals
 

4889
01:21:52,000 --> 01:21:54,229
create portals
better to each other or is it just as

4890
01:21:54,229 --> 01:21:54,239
better to each other or is it just as
 

4891
01:21:54,239 --> 01:21:55,669
better to each other or is it just as
you get more and more complex you get

4892
01:21:55,669 --> 01:21:55,679
you get more and more complex you get
 

4893
01:21:55,679 --> 01:21:57,669
you get more and more complex you get
better and better portals

4894
01:21:57,669 --> 01:21:57,679
better and better portals
 

4895
01:21:57,679 --> 01:22:00,149
better and better portals
well let me answer one one aspect that

4896
01:22:00,149 --> 01:22:00,159
well let me answer one one aspect that
 

4897
01:22:00,159 --> 01:22:01,910
well let me answer one one aspect that
i'm more confident about then i'll

4898
01:22:01,910 --> 01:22:01,920
i'm more confident about then i'll
 

4899
01:22:01,920 --> 01:22:03,590
i'm more confident about then i'll
speculate on that

4900
01:22:03,590 --> 01:22:03,600
speculate on that
 

4901
01:22:03,600 --> 01:22:05,430
speculate on that
why is why is it that the portal is so

4902
01:22:05,430 --> 01:22:05,440
why is why is it that the portal is so
 

4903
01:22:05,440 --> 01:22:07,030
why is why is it that the portal is so
bad with protons

4904
01:22:07,030 --> 01:22:07,040
bad with protons
 

4905
01:22:07,040 --> 01:22:08,950
bad with protons
well and and and elementary particles

4906
01:22:08,950 --> 01:22:08,960
well and and and elementary particles
 

4907
01:22:08,960 --> 01:22:10,629
well and and and elementary particles
more generally so quarks leptons and

4908
01:22:10,629 --> 01:22:10,639
more generally so quarks leptons and
 

4909
01:22:10,639 --> 01:22:12,149
more generally so quarks leptons and
gluons and so forth

4910
01:22:12,149 --> 01:22:12,159
gluons and so forth
 

4911
01:22:12,159 --> 01:22:14,709
gluons and so forth
well the reason for that is because

4912
01:22:14,709 --> 01:22:14,719
well the reason for that is because
 

4913
01:22:14,719 --> 01:22:16,149
well the reason for that is because
those are just

4914
01:22:16,149 --> 01:22:16,159
those are just
 

4915
01:22:16,159 --> 01:22:19,030
those are just
symmetries of space-time

4916
01:22:19,030 --> 01:22:19,040
symmetries of space-time
 

4917
01:22:19,040 --> 01:22:20,310
symmetries of space-time
more technically they're irreducible

4918
01:22:20,310 --> 01:22:20,320
more technically they're irreducible
 

4919
01:22:20,320 --> 01:22:22,229
more technically they're irreducible
representations of the poincare group of

4920
01:22:22,229 --> 01:22:22,239
representations of the poincare group of
 

4921
01:22:22,239 --> 01:22:25,350
representations of the poincare group of
space-time

4922
01:22:25,350 --> 01:22:25,360

 

4923
01:22:25,360 --> 01:22:27,350

so they're just

4924
01:22:27,350 --> 01:22:27,360
so they're just
 

4925
01:22:27,360 --> 01:22:29,669
so they're just
literally representations

4926
01:22:29,669 --> 01:22:29,679
literally representations
 

4927
01:22:29,679 --> 01:22:32,390
literally representations
of the data structure of space-time that

4928
01:22:32,390 --> 01:22:32,400
of the data structure of space-time that
 

4929
01:22:32,400 --> 01:22:33,510
of the data structure of space-time that
we're using

4930
01:22:33,510 --> 01:22:33,520
we're using
 

4931
01:22:33,520 --> 01:22:35,030
we're using
so that's why they're not very much

4932
01:22:35,030 --> 01:22:35,040
so that's why they're not very much
 

4933
01:22:35,040 --> 01:22:37,189
so that's why they're not very much
insightful they're they're just almost

4934
01:22:37,189 --> 01:22:37,199
insightful they're they're just almost
 

4935
01:22:37,199 --> 01:22:39,030
insightful they're they're just almost
entirely tied to the data structure

4936
01:22:39,030 --> 01:22:39,040
entirely tied to the data structure
 

4937
01:22:39,040 --> 01:22:41,270
entirely tied to the data structure
itself there's there's not much

4938
01:22:41,270 --> 01:22:41,280
itself there's there's not much
 

4939
01:22:41,280 --> 01:22:42,629
itself there's there's not much
that they're telling you only something

4940
01:22:42,629 --> 01:22:42,639
that they're telling you only something
 

4941
01:22:42,639 --> 01:22:44,229
that they're telling you only something
about the data structure not behind the

4942
01:22:44,229 --> 01:22:44,239
about the data structure not behind the
 

4943
01:22:44,239 --> 01:22:45,590
about the data structure not behind the
data structure it's only when we get to

4944
01:22:45,590 --> 01:22:45,600
data structure it's only when we get to
 

4945
01:22:45,600 --> 01:22:47,910
data structure it's only when we get to
higher levels that we're starting to in

4946
01:22:47,910 --> 01:22:47,920
higher levels that we're starting to in
 

4947
01:22:47,920 --> 01:22:49,669
higher levels that we're starting to in
some sense build portals to what's

4948
01:22:49,669 --> 01:22:49,679
some sense build portals to what's
 

4949
01:22:49,679 --> 01:22:50,870
some sense build portals to what's
behind

4950
01:22:50,870 --> 01:22:50,880
behind
 

4951
01:22:50,880 --> 01:22:54,070
behind
space time sure yeah so there's more and

4952
01:22:54,070 --> 01:22:54,080
space time sure yeah so there's more and
 

4953
01:22:54,080 --> 01:22:55,110
space time sure yeah so there's more and
more

4954
01:22:55,110 --> 01:22:55,120
more
 

4955
01:22:55,120 --> 01:22:56,790
more
um

4956
01:22:56,790 --> 01:22:56,800
um
 

4957
01:22:56,800 --> 01:22:59,590
um
complexity built on top of the

4958
01:22:59,590 --> 01:22:59,600
complexity built on top of the
 

4959
01:22:59,600 --> 01:23:01,990
complexity built on top of the
interface of space time with the cat so

4960
01:23:01,990 --> 01:23:02,000
interface of space time with the cat so
 

4961
01:23:02,000 --> 01:23:03,350
interface of space time with the cat so
you can actually build a portal right

4962
01:23:03,350 --> 01:23:03,360
you can actually build a portal right
 

4963
01:23:03,360 --> 01:23:05,110
you can actually build a portal right
yeah

4964
01:23:05,110 --> 01:23:05,120
yeah
 

4965
01:23:05,120 --> 01:23:08,709
yeah
yeah right

4966
01:23:08,709 --> 01:23:08,719

 

4967
01:23:08,719 --> 01:23:11,270

yeah i this interface of face and hair

4968
01:23:11,270 --> 01:23:11,280
yeah i this interface of face and hair
 

4969
01:23:11,280 --> 01:23:13,590
yeah i this interface of face and hair
and so on

4970
01:23:13,590 --> 01:23:13,600
and so on
 

4971
01:23:13,600 --> 01:23:16,709
and so on
my skin

4972
01:23:16,709 --> 01:23:16,719

 

4973
01:23:16,719 --> 01:23:18,629

there is some sinking going on between

4974
01:23:18,629 --> 01:23:18,639
there is some sinking going on between
 

4975
01:23:18,639 --> 01:23:21,910
there is some sinking going on between
humans though where we think like

4981
01:23:26,080 --> 01:23:27,750

01:23:27,750 --> 01:23:27,760
and starting to get a
 

4983
01:23:27,760 --> 01:23:29,910
and starting to get a
foggy view

4984
01:23:29,910 --> 01:23:29,920
foggy view
 

4985
01:23:29,920 --> 01:23:33,990
foggy view
of uh my memories in my head even though

4986
01:23:33,990 --> 01:23:34,000
of uh my memories in my head even though
 

4987
01:23:34,000 --> 01:23:35,669
of uh my memories in my head even though
you know this is the first time we're

4988
01:23:35,669 --> 01:23:35,679
you know this is the first time we're
 

4989
01:23:35,679 --> 01:23:37,830
you know this is the first time we're
talking you start to project your own

4990
01:23:37,830 --> 01:23:37,840
talking you start to project your own
 

4991
01:23:37,840 --> 01:23:40,470
talking you start to project your own
memories you start to solve like

4992
01:23:40,470 --> 01:23:40,480
memories you start to solve like
 

4993
01:23:40,480 --> 01:23:42,950
memories you start to solve like
a giant hierarchy of puzzles about a

4994
01:23:42,950 --> 01:23:42,960
a giant hierarchy of puzzles about a
 

4995
01:23:42,960 --> 01:23:44,310
a giant hierarchy of puzzles about a
human

4996
01:23:44,310 --> 01:23:44,320
human
 

4997
01:23:44,320 --> 01:23:46,149
human
because we're all uh there's a lot of

4998
01:23:46,149 --> 01:23:46,159
because we're all uh there's a lot of
 

4999
01:23:46,159 --> 01:23:48,390
because we're all uh there's a lot of
similarities a lot of it rhymes so you

5000
01:23:48,390 --> 01:23:48,400
similarities a lot of it rhymes so you
 

5001
01:23:48,400 --> 01:23:49,830
similarities a lot of it rhymes so you
start to make a lot of inferences you

5002
01:23:49,830 --> 01:23:49,840
start to make a lot of inferences you
 

5003
01:23:49,840 --> 01:23:51,669
start to make a lot of inferences you
build up this model

5004
01:23:51,669 --> 01:23:51,679
build up this model
 

5005
01:23:51,679 --> 01:23:53,110
build up this model
of a person you have a pretty

5006
01:23:53,110 --> 01:23:53,120
of a person you have a pretty
 

5007
01:23:53,120 --> 01:23:55,510
of a person you have a pretty
sophisticated model what's going on

5008
01:23:55,510 --> 01:23:55,520

again i just

5012
01:23:58,470 --> 01:23:58,480
again i just
 

5013
01:23:58,480 --> 01:24:00,950
again i just
i wonder if it's possible to construct

5014
01:24:00,950 --> 01:24:00,960
i wonder if it's possible to construct
 

5015
01:24:00,960 --> 01:24:02,950
i wonder if it's possible to construct
these models about each other and

5016
01:24:02,950 --> 01:24:02,960
these models about each other and
 

5017
01:24:02,960 --> 01:24:05,590
these models about each other and
nevertheless be very distant from an

there's a lot of work on this so there's

5022
01:24:10,070 --> 01:24:10,080
there's a lot of work on this so there's
 

5023
01:24:10,080 --> 01:24:11,590
there's a lot of work on this so there's
some interesting work called signaling

wanted to see if they could get people

5052
01:24:40,870 --> 01:24:40,880
wanted to see if they could get people
 

5053
01:24:40,880 --> 01:24:42,310
wanted to see if they could get people
to cooperate and how they carved the

5054
01:24:42,310 --> 01:24:42,320
to cooperate and how they carved the
 

5055
01:24:42,320 --> 01:24:45,830
to cooperate and how they carved the
color circle up into two units of words

5056
01:24:45,830 --> 01:24:45,840
color circle up into two units of words
 

5057
01:24:45,840 --> 01:24:46,709
color circle up into two units of words
and

5058
01:24:46,709 --> 01:24:46,719
and
 

5059
01:24:46,719 --> 01:24:48,629
and
so they had a game

5060
01:24:48,629 --> 01:24:48,639
so they had a game
 

5061
01:24:48,639 --> 01:24:49,910
so they had a game
theoretic kind of thing that they'd had

5062
01:24:49,910 --> 01:24:49,920
theoretic kind of thing that they'd had
 

5063
01:24:49,920 --> 01:24:51,590
theoretic kind of thing that they'd had
people do and what they found was that

5064
01:24:51,590 --> 01:24:51,600
people do and what they found was that
 

5065
01:24:51,600 --> 01:24:53,510
people do and what they found was that
when they included so

5066
01:24:53,510 --> 01:24:53,520
when they included so
 

5067
01:24:53,520 --> 01:24:55,430
when they included so
most people are trichromats you have

5068
01:24:55,430 --> 01:24:55,440
most people are trichromats you have
 

5069
01:24:55,440 --> 01:24:57,910
most people are trichromats you have
three kinds of cone photoreceptors but

5070
01:24:57,910 --> 01:24:57,920
three kinds of cone photoreceptors but
 

5071
01:24:57,920 --> 01:24:59,750
three kinds of cone photoreceptors but
there are some a lot of men seven

5072
01:24:59,750 --> 01:24:59,760
there are some a lot of men seven
 

5073
01:24:59,760 --> 01:25:01,430
there are some a lot of men seven
percent of men have are dichromates they

5074
01:25:01,430 --> 01:25:01,440
percent of men have are dichromates they
 

5075
01:25:01,440 --> 01:25:02,790
percent of men have are dichromates they
might be missing the red cone

5076
01:25:02,790 --> 01:25:02,800
might be missing the red cone
 

5077
01:25:02,800 --> 01:25:04,229
might be missing the red cone
photoreceptor

5078
01:25:04,229 --> 01:25:04,239
photoreceptor
 

5079
01:25:04,239 --> 01:25:06,470
photoreceptor
they found that the dichromats

5080
01:25:06,470 --> 01:25:06,480
they found that the dichromats
 

5081
01:25:06,480 --> 01:25:08,870
they found that the dichromats
had an outsized influence

5082
01:25:08,870 --> 01:25:08,880
had an outsized influence
 

5083
01:25:08,880 --> 01:25:11,910
had an outsized influence
on the final ways that the whole space

5084
01:25:11,910 --> 01:25:11,920
on the final ways that the whole space
 

5085
01:25:11,920 --> 01:25:13,910
on the final ways that the whole space
of colors was carved up and and labels

5086
01:25:13,910 --> 01:25:13,920
of colors was carved up and and labels
 

5087
01:25:13,920 --> 01:25:16,229
of colors was carved up and and labels
attached you needed to be able to

5088
01:25:16,229 --> 01:25:16,239
attached you needed to be able to
 

5089
01:25:16,239 --> 01:25:17,990
attached you needed to be able to
include the dichromats in the

5090
01:25:17,990 --> 01:25:18,000
include the dichromats in the
 

5091
01:25:18,000 --> 01:25:19,590
include the dichromats in the
conversation and so they had a bigger

5092
01:25:19,590 --> 01:25:19,600
conversation and so they had a bigger
 

5093
01:25:19,600 --> 01:25:21,669
conversation and so they had a bigger
influence on how you made the boundaries

5094
01:25:21,669 --> 01:25:21,679
influence on how you made the boundaries
 

5095
01:25:21,679 --> 01:25:23,510
influence on how you made the boundaries
of the language i thought that was a

5096
01:25:23,510 --> 01:25:23,520
of the language i thought that was a
 

5097
01:25:23,520 --> 01:25:25,910
of the language i thought that was a
really interesting kind of insight that

5098
01:25:25,910 --> 01:25:25,920
really interesting kind of insight that
 

5099
01:25:25,920 --> 01:25:28,070
really interesting kind of insight that
there's going to be again a game perhaps

5100
01:25:28,070 --> 01:25:28,080
there's going to be again a game perhaps
 

5101
01:25:28,080 --> 01:25:30,870
there's going to be again a game perhaps
a game where evolutionary or genetic

5102
01:25:30,870 --> 01:25:30,880
a game where evolutionary or genetic
 

5103
01:25:30,880 --> 01:25:32,629
a game where evolutionary or genetic
algorithm kind of thing that goes on in

5104
01:25:32,629 --> 01:25:32,639
algorithm kind of thing that goes on in
 

5105
01:25:32,639 --> 01:25:33,910
algorithm kind of thing that goes on in
terms of

5106
01:25:33,910 --> 01:25:33,920
terms of
 

5107
01:25:33,920 --> 01:25:36,390
terms of
learning to communicate in ways that

5108
01:25:36,390 --> 01:25:36,400
learning to communicate in ways that
 

5109
01:25:36,400 --> 01:25:37,750
learning to communicate in ways that
that are useful

5110
01:25:37,750 --> 01:25:37,760
that are useful
 

5111
01:25:37,760 --> 01:25:38,550
that are useful
and

5112
01:25:38,550 --> 01:25:38,560
and
 

5113
01:25:38,560 --> 01:25:40,229
and
so yeah you can use game theory to to

5114
01:25:40,229 --> 01:25:40,239
so yeah you can use game theory to to
 

5115
01:25:40,239 --> 01:25:41,990
so yeah you can use game theory to to
actually explore that or signaling games

5116
01:25:41,990 --> 01:25:42,000
actually explore that or signaling games
 

5117
01:25:42,000 --> 01:25:44,310
actually explore that or signaling games
um there's a lot of brilliant work on

5118
01:25:44,310 --> 01:25:44,320
um there's a lot of brilliant work on
 

5119
01:25:44,320 --> 01:25:46,470
um there's a lot of brilliant work on
that i'm not doing it but there's work

5120
01:25:46,470 --> 01:25:46,480
that i'm not doing it but there's work
 

5121
01:25:46,480 --> 01:25:47,510
that i'm not doing it but there's work
out there

5122
01:25:47,510 --> 01:25:47,520
out there
 

5123
01:25:47,520 --> 01:25:50,629
out there
so if it's okay let us tackle once more

5124
01:25:50,629 --> 01:25:50,639
so if it's okay let us tackle once more
 

5125
01:25:50,639 --> 01:25:53,430
so if it's okay let us tackle once more
and perhaps several more times after

5126
01:25:53,430 --> 01:25:53,440
and perhaps several more times after
 

5127
01:25:53,440 --> 01:25:56,950
and perhaps several more times after
the big topic of consciousness okay

5128
01:25:56,950 --> 01:25:56,960
the big topic of consciousness okay
 

5129
01:25:56,960 --> 01:25:59,430
the big topic of consciousness okay
this this very beautiful powerful things

5130
01:25:59,430 --> 01:25:59,440
this this very beautiful powerful things
 

5131
01:25:59,440 --> 01:26:01,110
this this very beautiful powerful things
that perhaps is the thing that makes us

5132
01:26:01,110 --> 01:26:01,120
that perhaps is the thing that makes us
 

5133
01:26:01,120 --> 01:26:03,750
that perhaps is the thing that makes us
human what is it what's the role of

5134
01:26:03,750 --> 01:26:03,760
human what is it what's the role of
 

5135
01:26:03,760 --> 01:26:05,990
human what is it what's the role of
consciousness in um

5136
01:26:05,990 --> 01:26:06,000
consciousness in um
 

5137
01:26:06,000 --> 01:26:07,510
consciousness in um
let's say even just the thing we've been

5138
01:26:07,510 --> 01:26:07,520
let's say even just the thing we've been
 

5139
01:26:07,520 --> 01:26:09,110
let's say even just the thing we've been
talking about which is the formation of

5140
01:26:09,110 --> 01:26:09,120
talking about which is the formation of
 

5141
01:26:09,120 --> 01:26:10,709
talking about which is the formation of
this interface

5142
01:26:10,709 --> 01:26:10,719
this interface
 

5143
01:26:10,719 --> 01:26:11,830
this interface
um

5144
01:26:11,830 --> 01:26:11,840
um
 

5145
01:26:11,840 --> 01:26:14,950
um
but any kind of ways you want to kind of

5146
01:26:14,950 --> 01:26:14,960
but any kind of ways you want to kind of
 

5147
01:26:14,960 --> 01:26:17,590
but any kind of ways you want to kind of
start sure uh tracking and talking about

5148
01:26:17,590 --> 01:26:17,600
start sure uh tracking and talking about
 

5149
01:26:17,600 --> 01:26:18,229
start sure uh tracking and talking about
it

5150
01:26:18,229 --> 01:26:18,239
it
 

5151
01:26:18,239 --> 01:26:20,229
it
well let me say first what most of my

5152
01:26:20,229 --> 01:26:20,239
well let me say first what most of my
 

5153
01:26:20,239 --> 01:26:22,870
well let me say first what most of my
colleagues say

5154
01:26:22,870 --> 01:26:22,880
colleagues say
 

5155
01:26:22,880 --> 01:26:24,149
colleagues say
99

5156
01:26:24,149 --> 01:26:24,159
99
 

5157
01:26:24,159 --> 01:26:26,149
99
are again assuming that space time is

5158
01:26:26,149 --> 01:26:26,159
are again assuming that space time is
 

5159
01:26:26,159 --> 01:26:27,430
are again assuming that space time is
fundamental

5160
01:26:27,430 --> 01:26:27,440
fundamental
 

5161
01:26:27,440 --> 01:26:29,189
fundamental
particles in space-time matter is

5162
01:26:29,189 --> 01:26:29,199
particles in space-time matter is
 

5163
01:26:29,199 --> 01:26:30,709
particles in space-time matter is
fundamental

5164
01:26:30,709 --> 01:26:30,719
fundamental
 

5165
01:26:30,719 --> 01:26:33,669
fundamental
and most are reductionist

5166
01:26:33,669 --> 01:26:33,679
and most are reductionist
 

5167
01:26:33,679 --> 01:26:36,310
and most are reductionist
and so the standard approach to

5168
01:26:36,310 --> 01:26:36,320
and so the standard approach to
 

5169
01:26:36,320 --> 01:26:39,510
and so the standard approach to
consciousness is to figure out

5170
01:26:39,510 --> 01:26:39,520
consciousness is to figure out
 

5171
01:26:39,520 --> 01:26:41,350
consciousness is to figure out
what

5172
01:26:41,350 --> 01:26:41,360
what
 

5173
01:26:41,360 --> 01:26:43,750
what
complicated systems of matter

5174
01:26:43,750 --> 01:26:43,760
complicated systems of matter
 

5175
01:26:43,760 --> 01:26:45,830
complicated systems of matter
with the right functional properties

5176
01:26:45,830 --> 01:26:45,840
with the right functional properties
 

5177
01:26:45,840 --> 01:26:47,830
with the right functional properties
could possibly lead to the emergence of

5178
01:26:47,830 --> 01:26:47,840
could possibly lead to the emergence of
 

5179
01:26:47,840 --> 01:26:50,070
could possibly lead to the emergence of
consciousness that's the general idea

5180
01:26:50,070 --> 01:26:50,080
consciousness that's the general idea
 

5181
01:26:50,080 --> 01:26:51,350
consciousness that's the general idea
right

5182
01:26:51,350 --> 01:26:51,360
right
 

5183
01:26:51,360 --> 01:26:52,390
right
so

5184
01:26:52,390 --> 01:26:52,400
so
 

5185
01:26:52,400 --> 01:26:55,510
so
maybe you have to have neurons maybe

5186
01:26:55,510 --> 01:26:55,520
maybe you have to have neurons maybe
 

5187
01:26:55,520 --> 01:26:57,510
maybe you have to have neurons maybe
only if you have neurons but

5188
01:26:57,510 --> 01:26:57,520
only if you have neurons but
 

5189
01:26:57,520 --> 01:26:59,110
only if you have neurons but
that might not be enough they have to

5190
01:26:59,110 --> 01:26:59,120
that might not be enough they have to
 

5191
01:26:59,120 --> 01:27:00,790
that might not be enough they have to
certain kinds of complexity in their

5192
01:27:00,790 --> 01:27:00,800
certain kinds of complexity in their
 

5193
01:27:00,800 --> 01:27:02,709
certain kinds of complexity in their
their organization and their dynamics

5194
01:27:02,709 --> 01:27:02,719
their organization and their dynamics
 

5195
01:27:02,719 --> 01:27:04,149
their organization and their dynamics
certain kind of network abilities for

5196
01:27:04,149 --> 01:27:04,159
certain kind of network abilities for
 

5197
01:27:04,159 --> 01:27:06,550
certain kind of network abilities for
example

5198
01:27:06,550 --> 01:27:06,560
example
 

5199
01:27:06,560 --> 01:27:08,709
example
so there's

5200
01:27:08,709 --> 01:27:08,719
so there's
 

5201
01:27:08,719 --> 01:27:11,750
so there's
there are those who say for example that

5202
01:27:11,750 --> 01:27:11,760
there are those who say for example that
 

5203
01:27:11,760 --> 01:27:14,070
there are those who say for example that
consciousness arises from orchestrated

5204
01:27:14,070 --> 01:27:14,080
consciousness arises from orchestrated
 

5205
01:27:14,080 --> 01:27:15,750
consciousness arises from orchestrated
collapse of quantum states of

5206
01:27:15,750 --> 01:27:15,760
collapse of quantum states of
 

5207
01:27:15,760 --> 01:27:18,149
collapse of quantum states of
microtubules in neurons certain

5208
01:27:18,149 --> 01:27:18,159
microtubules in neurons certain
 

5209
01:27:18,159 --> 01:27:19,830
microtubules in neurons certain
so this is

5210
01:27:19,830 --> 01:27:19,840
so this is
 

5211
01:27:19,840 --> 01:27:22,390
so this is
hamroff and penrose have that's kind of

5212
01:27:22,390 --> 01:27:22,400
hamroff and penrose have that's kind of
 

5213
01:27:22,400 --> 01:27:24,149
hamroff and penrose have that's kind of
so it's it's a you start with something

5214
01:27:24,149 --> 01:27:24,159
so it's it's a you start with something
 

5215
01:27:24,159 --> 01:27:25,189
so it's it's a you start with something
physical

5216
01:27:25,189 --> 01:27:25,199
physical
 

5217
01:27:25,199 --> 01:27:25,990
physical
a

5218
01:27:25,990 --> 01:27:26,000
a
 

5219
01:27:26,000 --> 01:27:30,390
a
property of quantum states of neurons

5220
01:27:30,390 --> 01:27:30,400

 

5221
01:27:30,400 --> 01:27:33,189

of microtubules and neurons and you say

5222
01:27:33,189 --> 01:27:33,199
of microtubules and neurons and you say
 

5223
01:27:33,199 --> 01:27:34,790
of microtubules and neurons and you say
that somehow an orchestrated collapse of

5224
01:27:34,790 --> 01:27:34,800
that somehow an orchestrated collapse of
 

5225
01:27:34,800 --> 01:27:35,590
that somehow an orchestrated collapse of
those

5226
01:27:35,590 --> 01:27:35,600
those
 

5227
01:27:35,600 --> 01:27:37,510
those
is consciousness or conscious

5228
01:27:37,510 --> 01:27:37,520
is consciousness or conscious
 

5229
01:27:37,520 --> 01:27:38,629
is consciousness or conscious
experiences

5230
01:27:38,629 --> 01:27:38,639
experiences
 

5231
01:27:38,639 --> 01:27:40,550
experiences
or integrated information theory again

5232
01:27:40,550 --> 01:27:40,560
or integrated information theory again
 

5233
01:27:40,560 --> 01:27:42,310
or integrated information theory again
you start with something physical

5234
01:27:42,310 --> 01:27:42,320
you start with something physical
 

5235
01:27:42,320 --> 01:27:43,430
you start with something physical
and if it has the right kind of

5236
01:27:43,430 --> 01:27:43,440
and if it has the right kind of
 

5237
01:27:43,440 --> 01:27:45,189
and if it has the right kind of
functional properties that's something

5238
01:27:45,189 --> 01:27:45,199
functional properties that's something
 

5239
01:27:45,199 --> 01:27:46,709
functional properties that's something
they call fee with the right kind of

5240
01:27:46,709 --> 01:27:46,719
they call fee with the right kind of
 

5241
01:27:46,719 --> 01:27:48,870
they call fee with the right kind of
integrated information then you have

5242
01:27:48,870 --> 01:27:48,880
integrated information then you have
 

5243
01:27:48,880 --> 01:27:50,470
integrated information then you have
consciousness

5244
01:27:50,470 --> 01:27:50,480
consciousness
 

5245
01:27:50,480 --> 01:27:53,590
consciousness
or you can be a pan psychist

5246
01:27:53,590 --> 01:27:53,600
or you can be a pan psychist
 

5247
01:27:53,600 --> 01:27:55,910
or you can be a pan psychist
philip gough for example where you you

5248
01:27:55,910 --> 01:27:55,920
philip gough for example where you you
 

5249
01:27:55,920 --> 01:27:59,270
philip gough for example where you you
might say well in addition to the

5250
01:27:59,270 --> 01:27:59,280
might say well in addition to the
 

5251
01:27:59,280 --> 01:28:01,189
might say well in addition to the
particles in space and time

5252
01:28:01,189 --> 01:28:01,199
particles in space and time
 

5253
01:28:01,199 --> 01:28:03,510
particles in space and time
those particles are not just matter they

5254
01:28:03,510 --> 01:28:03,520
those particles are not just matter they
 

5255
01:28:03,520 --> 01:28:04,709
those particles are not just matter they
also could have say a unit of

5256
01:28:04,709 --> 01:28:04,719
also could have say a unit of
 

5257
01:28:04,719 --> 01:28:06,709
also could have say a unit of
consciousness

5258
01:28:06,709 --> 01:28:06,719
consciousness
 

5259
01:28:06,719 --> 01:28:08,470
consciousness
and so but once again you're taking

5260
01:28:08,470 --> 01:28:08,480
and so but once again you're taking
 

5261
01:28:08,480 --> 01:28:09,830
and so but once again you're taking
space and time and particles as

5262
01:28:09,830 --> 01:28:09,840
space and time and particles as
 

5263
01:28:09,840 --> 01:28:11,030
space and time and particles as
fundamental

5264
01:28:11,030 --> 01:28:11,040
fundamental
 

5265
01:28:11,040 --> 01:28:12,629
fundamental
and you're adding

5266
01:28:12,629 --> 01:28:12,639
and you're adding
 

5267
01:28:12,639 --> 01:28:14,470
and you're adding
a new property to them see their

5268
01:28:14,470 --> 01:28:14,480
a new property to them see their
 

5269
01:28:14,480 --> 01:28:15,910
a new property to them see their
consciousness and then you have to talk

5270
01:28:15,910 --> 01:28:15,920
consciousness and then you have to talk
 

5271
01:28:15,920 --> 01:28:19,510
consciousness and then you have to talk
about how when a proton and neutron

5272
01:28:19,510 --> 01:28:19,520
about how when a proton and neutron
 

5273
01:28:19,520 --> 01:28:20,870
about how when a proton and neutron
where proton and electron get together

5274
01:28:20,870 --> 01:28:20,880
where proton and electron get together
 

5275
01:28:20,880 --> 01:28:22,550
where proton and electron get together
to form hydrogen then how those

5276
01:28:22,550 --> 01:28:22,560
to form hydrogen then how those
 

5277
01:28:22,560 --> 01:28:24,229
to form hydrogen then how those
consciousnesses

5278
01:28:24,229 --> 01:28:24,239
consciousnesses
 

5279
01:28:24,239 --> 01:28:26,629
consciousnesses
merge to or interact to create the

5280
01:28:26,629 --> 01:28:26,639
merge to or interact to create the
 

5281
01:28:26,639 --> 01:28:29,750
merge to or interact to create the
clutchness of hydrogen and so forth

5282
01:28:29,750 --> 01:28:29,760
clutchness of hydrogen and so forth
 

5283
01:28:29,760 --> 01:28:31,590
clutchness of hydrogen and so forth
um there's a tension schema theory which

5284
01:28:31,590 --> 01:28:31,600
um there's a tension schema theory which
 

5285
01:28:31,600 --> 01:28:34,870
um there's a tension schema theory which
again this is how neural network

5286
01:28:34,870 --> 01:28:34,880
again this is how neural network
 

5287
01:28:34,880 --> 01:28:37,510
again this is how neural network
processes representing to the network

5288
01:28:37,510 --> 01:28:37,520
processes representing to the network
 

5289
01:28:37,520 --> 01:28:40,149
processes representing to the network
itself its attentional processes that

5290
01:28:40,149 --> 01:28:40,159
itself its attentional processes that
 

5291
01:28:40,159 --> 01:28:43,189
itself its attentional processes that
could be consciousness um there's global

5292
01:28:43,189 --> 01:28:43,199
could be consciousness um there's global
 

5293
01:28:43,199 --> 01:28:45,270
could be consciousness um there's global
workspace theory

5294
01:28:45,270 --> 01:28:45,280
workspace theory
 

5295
01:28:45,280 --> 01:28:47,430
workspace theory
and neuronal global work experience

5296
01:28:47,430 --> 01:28:47,440
and neuronal global work experience
 

5297
01:28:47,440 --> 01:28:49,270
and neuronal global work experience
workspace theory so there's many many

5298
01:28:49,270 --> 01:28:49,280
workspace theory so there's many many
 

5299
01:28:49,280 --> 01:28:50,790
workspace theory so there's many many
theories of this type what's what's

5300
01:28:50,790 --> 01:28:50,800
theories of this type what's what's
 

5301
01:28:50,800 --> 01:28:52,709
theories of this type what's what's
common to all of them

5302
01:28:52,709 --> 01:28:52,719
common to all of them
 

5303
01:28:52,719 --> 01:28:54,390
common to all of them
is they assume that spacetime is

5304
01:28:54,390 --> 01:28:54,400
is they assume that spacetime is
 

5305
01:28:54,400 --> 01:28:55,990
is they assume that spacetime is
fundamental

5306
01:28:55,990 --> 01:28:56,000
fundamental
 

5307
01:28:56,000 --> 01:28:57,830
fundamental
they assume that physical processes and

5308
01:28:57,830 --> 01:28:57,840
they assume that physical processes and
 

5309
01:28:57,840 --> 01:28:59,430
they assume that physical processes and
space time is fundamental

5310
01:28:59,430 --> 01:28:59,440
space time is fundamental
 

5311
01:28:59,440 --> 01:29:01,750
space time is fundamental
pan psychism adds consciousness says an

5312
01:29:01,750 --> 01:29:01,760
pan psychism adds consciousness says an
 

5313
01:29:01,760 --> 01:29:03,510
pan psychism adds consciousness says an
additional thing is almost duelist in

5314
01:29:03,510 --> 01:29:03,520
additional thing is almost duelist in
 

5315
01:29:03,520 --> 01:29:05,750
additional thing is almost duelist in
that regard

5316
01:29:05,750 --> 01:29:05,760
that regard
 

5317
01:29:05,760 --> 01:29:06,790
that regard
and

5318
01:29:06,790 --> 01:29:06,800
and
 

5319
01:29:06,800 --> 01:29:08,470
and
my attitude is

5320
01:29:08,470 --> 01:29:08,480
my attitude is
 

5321
01:29:08,480 --> 01:29:10,950
my attitude is
our best science is telling us

5322
01:29:10,950 --> 01:29:10,960
our best science is telling us
 

5323
01:29:10,960 --> 01:29:13,189
our best science is telling us
that space-time is not fundamental

5324
01:29:13,189 --> 01:29:13,199
that space-time is not fundamental
 

5325
01:29:13,199 --> 01:29:15,189
that space-time is not fundamental
so

5326
01:29:15,189 --> 01:29:15,199
so
 

5327
01:29:15,199 --> 01:29:16,950
so
why is that important here

5328
01:29:16,950 --> 01:29:16,960
why is that important here
 

5329
01:29:16,960 --> 01:29:19,830
why is that important here
well for centuries

5330
01:29:19,830 --> 01:29:19,840
well for centuries
 

5331
01:29:19,840 --> 01:29:21,189
well for centuries
deep thinkers

5332
01:29:21,189 --> 01:29:21,199
deep thinkers
 

5333
01:29:21,199 --> 01:29:22,229
deep thinkers
thought of

5334
01:29:22,229 --> 01:29:22,239
thought of
 

5335
01:29:22,239 --> 01:29:24,470
thought of
earth air fire and water as the

5336
01:29:24,470 --> 01:29:24,480
earth air fire and water as the
 

5337
01:29:24,480 --> 01:29:26,310
earth air fire and water as the
fundamental elements it was a

5338
01:29:26,310 --> 01:29:26,320
fundamental elements it was a
 

5339
01:29:26,320 --> 01:29:28,390
fundamental elements it was a
reductionist kind of idea

5340
01:29:28,390 --> 01:29:28,400
reductionist kind of idea
 

5341
01:29:28,400 --> 01:29:29,910
reductionist kind of idea
nothing was more elemental than those

5342
01:29:29,910 --> 01:29:29,920
nothing was more elemental than those
 

5343
01:29:29,920 --> 01:29:31,669
nothing was more elemental than those
and you could you could sort of build

5344
01:29:31,669 --> 01:29:31,679
and you could you could sort of build
 

5345
01:29:31,679 --> 01:29:33,270
and you could you could sort of build
everything up from those

5346
01:29:33,270 --> 01:29:33,280
everything up from those
 

5347
01:29:33,280 --> 01:29:35,270
everything up from those
when we got the periodic table of

5348
01:29:35,270 --> 01:29:35,280
when we got the periodic table of
 

5349
01:29:35,280 --> 01:29:37,110
when we got the periodic table of
elements

5350
01:29:37,110 --> 01:29:37,120
elements
 

5351
01:29:37,120 --> 01:29:39,430
elements
we realized that um

5352
01:29:39,430 --> 01:29:39,440
we realized that um
 

5353
01:29:39,440 --> 01:29:41,350
we realized that um
of course we want to study earth air

5354
01:29:41,350 --> 01:29:41,360
of course we want to study earth air
 

5355
01:29:41,360 --> 01:29:43,030
of course we want to study earth air
fire and water there's combustion

5356
01:29:43,030 --> 01:29:43,040
fire and water there's combustion
 

5357
01:29:43,040 --> 01:29:45,430
fire and water there's combustion
science for fire there's you know

5358
01:29:45,430 --> 01:29:45,440
science for fire there's you know
 

5359
01:29:45,440 --> 01:29:48,149
science for fire there's you know
um there's sciences for for

5360
01:29:48,149 --> 01:29:48,159
um there's sciences for for
 

5361
01:29:48,159 --> 01:29:49,590
um there's sciences for for
all these other things water and so

5362
01:29:49,590 --> 01:29:49,600
all these other things water and so
 

5363
01:29:49,600 --> 01:29:51,430
all these other things water and so
forth so we're going to do science with

5364
01:29:51,430 --> 01:29:51,440
forth so we're going to do science with
 

5365
01:29:51,440 --> 01:29:54,229
forth so we're going to do science with
these things but but fundamental no no

5366
01:29:54,229 --> 01:29:54,239
these things but but fundamental no no
 

5367
01:29:54,239 --> 01:29:55,270
these things but but fundamental no no
if you're looking for something

5368
01:29:55,270 --> 01:29:55,280
if you're looking for something
 

5369
01:29:55,280 --> 01:29:57,430
if you're looking for something
fundamental those are the wrong building

5370
01:29:57,430 --> 01:29:57,440
fundamental those are the wrong building

there's silicon that there's iron that

5382
01:30:07,590 --> 01:30:07,600
there's silicon that there's iron that
 

5383
01:30:07,600 --> 01:30:08,629
there's silicon that there's iron that
there's all these different kinds of

01:30:08,629 --> 01:30:08,639
there's all these different kinds of
 

5385
01:30:08,639 --> 01:30:10,149
there's all these different kinds of
things that project into what we call

5386
01:30:10,149 --> 01:30:10,159
things that project into what we call
 

5387
01:30:10,159 --> 01:30:11,830
things that project into what we call
earth

5388
01:30:11,830 --> 01:30:11,840
earth
 

5389
01:30:11,840 --> 01:30:13,110
earth
you're

5390
01:30:13,110 --> 01:30:13,120
you're
 

5391
01:30:13,120 --> 01:30:15,110
you're
you're you're hopelessly lost you're not

5392
01:30:15,110 --> 01:30:15,120
you're you're hopelessly lost you're not
 

5393
01:30:15,120 --> 01:30:16,149
you're you're hopelessly lost you're not
fundamental you're not going to get

5394
01:30:16,149 --> 01:30:16,159
fundamental you're not going to get
 

5395
01:30:16,159 --> 01:30:18,149
fundamental you're not going to get
there and then

5396
01:30:18,149 --> 01:30:18,159
there and then
 

5397
01:30:18,159 --> 01:30:20,470
there and then
after the periodic table then we came up

5398
01:30:20,470 --> 01:30:20,480
after the periodic table then we came up
 

5399
01:30:20,480 --> 01:30:22,629
after the periodic table then we came up
with quarks leptons and gluons the the

5400
01:30:22,629 --> 01:30:22,639
with quarks leptons and gluons the the
 

5401
01:30:22,639 --> 01:30:24,390
with quarks leptons and gluons the the
particles of the standard you know the

5402
01:30:24,390 --> 01:30:24,400
particles of the standard you know the
 

5403
01:30:24,400 --> 01:30:26,390
particles of the standard you know the
standard model of physics

5404
01:30:26,390 --> 01:30:26,400
standard model of physics
 

5405
01:30:26,400 --> 01:30:29,110
standard model of physics
and and and so we actually now know that

5406
01:30:29,110 --> 01:30:29,120
and and and so we actually now know that
 

5407
01:30:29,120 --> 01:30:33,110
and and and so we actually now know that
if you really want to get fundamental

5408
01:30:33,110 --> 01:30:33,120

 

5409
01:30:33,120 --> 01:30:34,790

the periodic table isn't it it's good

5410
01:30:34,790 --> 01:30:34,800
the periodic table isn't it it's good
 

5411
01:30:34,800 --> 01:30:36,390
the periodic table isn't it it's good
for chemistry it's just wonderful for

01:30:36,390 --> 01:30:36,400
for chemistry it's just wonderful for
 

5413
01:30:36,400 --> 01:30:38,470
for chemistry it's just wonderful for
chemistry but if you're trying to go

well now

5424
01:30:47,750 --> 01:30:47,760
well now
 

5425
01:30:47,760 --> 01:30:50,550
well now
we've discovered space-time itself is

so

5544
01:32:51,669 --> 01:32:51,679
so
 

5545
01:32:51,679 --> 01:32:53,750
so
it's also possible that

5546
01:32:53,750 --> 01:32:53,760
it's also possible that
 

5547
01:32:53,760 --> 01:32:56,390
it's also possible that
our assumption of space-time is not just

5548
01:32:56,390 --> 01:32:56,400
our assumption of space-time is not just
 

5549
01:32:56,400 --> 01:32:58,790
our assumption of space-time is not just
doomed but it's wrong

5550
01:32:58,790 --> 01:32:58,800
doomed but it's wrong
 

5551
01:32:58,800 --> 01:33:00,790
doomed but it's wrong
well if we believe that it's fundamental

5552
01:33:00,790 --> 01:33:00,800
well if we believe that it's fundamental
 

5553
01:33:00,800 --> 01:33:01,990
well if we believe that it's fundamental
that's wrong

5554
01:33:01,990 --> 01:33:02,000
that's wrong
 

5555
01:33:02,000 --> 01:33:04,229
that's wrong
but if we believe it's a useful tool

5556
01:33:04,229 --> 01:33:04,239
but if we believe it's a useful tool
 

5557
01:33:04,239 --> 01:33:06,390
but if we believe it's a useful tool
that's right but he could see but

5558
01:33:06,390 --> 01:33:06,400
that's right but he could see but
 

5559
01:33:06,400 --> 01:33:08,629
that's right but he could see but
bleeding somebody to death was believed

5560
01:33:08,629 --> 01:33:08,639
bleeding somebody to death was believed
 

5561
01:33:08,639 --> 01:33:11,030
bleeding somebody to death was believed
to be a useful tool and that was true

5562
01:33:11,030 --> 01:33:11,040
to be a useful tool and that was true
 

5563
01:33:11,040 --> 01:33:14,149
to be a useful tool and that was true
it wasn't just not fundamental right it

5564
01:33:14,149 --> 01:33:14,159
it wasn't just not fundamental right it
 

5565
01:33:14,159 --> 01:33:14,950
it wasn't just not fundamental right it
was

5566
01:33:14,950 --> 01:33:14,960
was
 

5567
01:33:14,960 --> 01:33:15,990
was
very

5568
01:33:15,990 --> 01:33:16,000
very
 

5569
01:33:16,000 --> 01:33:17,750
very
i'm sure there's cases in which bleeding

5570
01:33:17,750 --> 01:33:17,760
i'm sure there's cases in which bleeding
 

5571
01:33:17,760 --> 01:33:19,430
i'm sure there's cases in which bleeding
somebody would work but it would be a

5572
01:33:19,430 --> 01:33:19,440
somebody would work but it would be a
 

5573
01:33:19,440 --> 01:33:23,430
somebody would work but it would be a
very tiny tiny tiny percentage of cases

5574
01:33:23,430 --> 01:33:23,440
very tiny tiny tiny percentage of cases
 

5575
01:33:23,440 --> 01:33:26,149
very tiny tiny tiny percentage of cases
so it could be that it's wrong like it's

5576
01:33:26,149 --> 01:33:26,159
so it could be that it's wrong like it's
 

5577
01:33:26,159 --> 01:33:29,110
so it could be that it's wrong like it's
a side road that's ultimately leading to

5578
01:33:29,110 --> 01:33:29,120
a side road that's ultimately leading to
 

5579
01:33:29,120 --> 01:33:30,390
a side road that's ultimately leading to
a dead end

5580
01:33:30,390 --> 01:33:30,400
a dead end
 

5581
01:33:30,400 --> 01:33:32,390
a dead end
as opposed to a truck stop or something

5582
01:33:32,390 --> 01:33:32,400
as opposed to a truck stop or something
 

5583
01:33:32,400 --> 01:33:34,550
as opposed to a truck stop or something
that you can get off of

5584
01:33:34,550 --> 01:33:34,560
that you can get off of
 

5585
01:33:34,560 --> 01:33:36,950
that you can get off of
my feeling is not the dead end kind of

5586
01:33:36,950 --> 01:33:36,960
my feeling is not the dead end kind of
 

5587
01:33:36,960 --> 01:33:38,310
my feeling is not the dead end kind of
thing i i think that the what the

01:33:38,310 --> 01:33:38,320
thing i i think that the what the
 

5589
01:33:38,320 --> 01:33:39,750
thing i i think that the what the
physicists are finding is that there are

5590
01:33:39,750 --> 01:33:39,760
physicists are finding is that there are
 

5591
01:33:39,760 --> 01:33:42,390
physicists are finding is that there are
these structures beyond space time but

5592
01:33:42,390 --> 01:33:42,400
these structures beyond space time but
 

5593
01:33:42,400 --> 01:33:44,390
these structures beyond space time but
they project back into space time and so

5594
01:33:44,390 --> 01:33:44,400
they project back into space time and so
 

5595
01:33:44,400 --> 01:33:45,750
they project back into space time and so

01:34:20,800 --> 01:34:23,750
being smaller in space and time or space
time is a fundamental nature of reality

time is a fundamental nature of reality
that's is a that's that's just wrong it

yeah so you're saying size doesn't

irreducible representation so that's
 

5717
01:35:38,320 --> 01:35:40,790
irreducible representation so that's
what you're getting closer to not to a

we'll return again to this question of

we'll return again to this question of
 

5725
01:35:46,880 --> 01:35:47,990
we'll return again to this question of
dynamics

5726

dynamics
 

5727
01:35:48,000 --> 01:35:49,910

01:35:49,910 --> 01:35:49,920
because you keep
 

5729
01:35:49,920 --> 01:35:51,990
because you keep
saying that space-time is doomed but

01:35:51,990 --> 01:35:52,000
saying that space-time is doomed but
 

5731

that it's very interesting to see why
why time gets the bad cred too because

why time gets the bad cred too because

why time gets the bad cred too because
how do you have dynamics without time is

what is consciousness if

outside of space-time
if we think that we want to have a model

5758
01:36:20,070 --> 01:36:20,080
if we think that we want to have a model
 

5759
01:36:20,080 --> 01:36:22,229
if we think that we want to have a model
of consciousness we as scientists then

01:36:22,229 --> 01:36:22,239
of consciousness we as scientists then
 

5761
01:36:22,239 --> 01:36:23,189
of consciousness we as scientists then
have to

5762
01:36:23,189 --> 01:36:23,199
have to
 

5763
01:36:23,199 --> 01:36:25,189
have to
say what do we want to write down what

5764
01:36:25,189 --> 01:36:25,199
say what do we want to write down what
 

5765
01:36:25,199 --> 01:36:26,790
say what do we want to write down what
what what kind of mathematical model are

5766
01:36:26,790 --> 01:36:26,800
what what kind of mathematical model are
 

5767
01:36:26,800 --> 01:36:28,870
what what kind of mathematical model are
we going to write down right and if you

5768
01:36:28,870 --> 01:36:28,880
we going to write down right and if you
 

5769
01:36:28,880 --> 01:36:29,990
we going to write down right and if you
think about it there's lots of things

5770
01:36:29,990 --> 01:36:30,000
think about it there's lots of things
 

5771
01:36:30,000 --> 01:36:31,270
think about it there's lots of things
that you might want to write down about

5772
01:36:31,270 --> 01:36:31,280
that you might want to write down about
 

5773
01:36:31,280 --> 01:36:32,390
that you might want to write down about
consciousness

5774
01:36:32,390 --> 01:36:32,400

5775
01:36:32,400 --> 01:36:35,430

really complicated subject

5776
01:36:35,430 --> 01:36:35,440
really complicated subject
 

5777
01:36:35,440 --> 01:36:36,709
really complicated subject
so most of my colleagues are saying

5778
01:36:36,709 --> 01:36:36,719
so most of my colleagues are saying
 

5779
01:36:36,719 --> 01:36:38,550
so most of my colleagues are saying
let's start with matter or neurons and

5780
01:36:38,550 --> 01:36:38,560
let's start with matter or neurons and
 

5781
01:36:38,560 --> 01:36:39,830
let's start with matter or neurons and
and

5782
01:36:39,830 --> 01:36:39,840
and
 

5783
01:36:39,840 --> 01:36:41,030
and
say what properties of matter could

5784
01:36:41,030 --> 01:36:41,040
say what properties of matter could
 

5785
01:36:41,040 --> 01:36:43,030
say what properties of matter could
create consciousness but i'm saying that

5786
01:36:43,030 --> 01:36:43,040
create consciousness but i'm saying that
 

5787
01:36:43,040 --> 01:36:45,030
create consciousness but i'm saying that
that whole thing is out

5788
01:36:45,030 --> 01:36:45,040
that whole thing is out
 

5789
01:36:45,040 --> 01:36:46,629
that whole thing is out
space time is doomed that whole thing is

5790
01:36:46,629 --> 01:36:46,639
space time is doomed that whole thing is
 

5791
01:36:46,639 --> 01:36:47,590
space time is doomed that whole thing is
out

5792
01:36:47,590 --> 01:36:47,600
out
 

5793
01:36:47,600 --> 01:36:49,669
out
we need to look at consciousness qua

5794
01:36:49,669 --> 01:36:49,679
we need to look at consciousness qua
 

5795
01:36:49,679 --> 01:36:51,189
we need to look at consciousness qua
consciousness

5796
01:36:51,189 --> 01:36:51,199
consciousness
 

5797
01:36:51,199 --> 01:36:52,629
consciousness
in other words not as something that

5798
01:36:52,629 --> 01:36:52,639
in other words not as something that
 

5799
01:36:52,639 --> 01:36:54,790
in other words not as something that
arises in space and time but perhaps

5800
01:36:54,790 --> 01:36:54,800
arises in space and time but perhaps
 

5801
01:36:54,800 --> 01:36:55,830
arises in space and time but perhaps
it's something that creates space and

5802
01:36:55,830 --> 01:36:55,840
it's something that creates space and
 

5803
01:36:55,840 --> 01:36:58,149
it's something that creates space and
time as a data structure

5804
01:36:58,149 --> 01:36:58,159
time as a data structure
 

5805
01:36:58,159 --> 01:37:00,550
time as a data structure
so what do we want and here again

5806
01:37:00,550 --> 01:37:00,560
so what do we want and here again
 

5807
01:37:00,560 --> 01:37:02,310
so what do we want and here again
there's no hard and fast rule but what

5808
01:37:02,310 --> 01:37:02,320
there's no hard and fast rule but what
 

5809
01:37:02,320 --> 01:37:05,669
there's no hard and fast rule but what
you as a scientist have to do is to pick

5810
01:37:05,669 --> 01:37:05,679
you as a scientist have to do is to pick
 

5811
01:37:05,679 --> 01:37:08,229
you as a scientist have to do is to pick
what you think are the minimal

5812
01:37:08,229 --> 01:37:08,239
what you think are the minimal
 

5813
01:37:08,239 --> 01:37:09,590
what you think are the minimal
assumptions

5814
01:37:09,590 --> 01:37:09,600
assumptions
 

5815
01:37:09,600 --> 01:37:11,990
assumptions
that are going to allow you to boot up

5816
01:37:11,990 --> 01:37:12,000
that are going to allow you to boot up
 

5817
01:37:12,000 --> 01:37:13,669
that are going to allow you to boot up
a comprehensive theory

5818
01:37:13,669 --> 01:37:13,679
a comprehensive theory
 

5819
01:37:13,679 --> 01:37:16,310
a comprehensive theory
that is the trick

5820
01:37:16,310 --> 01:37:16,320
that is the trick
 

5821
01:37:16,320 --> 01:37:18,709
that is the trick
so what do i want so what what i chose

5822
01:37:18,709 --> 01:37:18,719
so what do i want so what what i chose
 

5823
01:37:18,719 --> 01:37:22,870
so what do i want so what what i chose
to do was to have three things

5824
01:37:22,870 --> 01:37:22,880

 

5825
01:37:22,880 --> 01:37:24,229

i said that there are conscious

5826
01:37:24,229 --> 01:37:24,239
i said that there are conscious
 

5827
01:37:24,239 --> 01:37:26,149
i said that there are conscious
experiences

5828
01:37:26,149 --> 01:37:26,159
experiences
 

5829
01:37:26,159 --> 01:37:29,430
experiences
feeling of headache the smell of garlic

5830
01:37:29,430 --> 01:37:29,440
feeling of headache the smell of garlic
 

5831
01:37:29,440 --> 01:37:30,709
feeling of headache the smell of garlic
um

5832
01:37:30,709 --> 01:37:30,719
um
 

5833
01:37:30,719 --> 01:37:32,709
um
experiencing the color red there are

5834
01:37:32,709 --> 01:37:32,719
experiencing the color red there are
 

5835
01:37:32,719 --> 01:37:33,830
experiencing the color red there are
those are conscious so that's a

5836
01:37:33,830 --> 01:37:33,840
those are conscious so that's a
 

5837
01:37:33,840 --> 01:37:35,430
those are conscious so that's a
primitive theory and the reason i want

5838
01:37:35,430 --> 01:37:35,440
primitive theory and the reason i want
 

5839
01:37:35,440 --> 01:37:37,510
primitive theory and the reason i want
few primitives why because those are the

5840
01:37:37,510 --> 01:37:37,520
few primitives why because those are the
 

5841
01:37:37,520 --> 01:37:38,709
few primitives why because those are the
miracles of the theory right the

5842
01:37:38,709 --> 01:37:38,719
miracles of the theory right the
 

5843
01:37:38,719 --> 01:37:40,310
miracles of the theory right the
primitives the assumptions of your

5844
01:37:40,310 --> 01:37:40,320
primitives the assumptions of your
 

5845
01:37:40,320 --> 01:37:41,350
primitives the assumptions of your
theory are the things you're not going

5846
01:37:41,350 --> 01:37:41,360
theory are the things you're not going
 

5847
01:37:41,360 --> 01:37:43,109
theory are the things you're not going
to explain those are the things you

5848
01:37:43,109 --> 01:37:43,119
to explain those are the things you
 

5849
01:37:43,119 --> 01:37:45,030
to explain those are the things you
assume and those experiences you

5850
01:37:45,030 --> 01:37:45,040
assume and those experiences you
 

5851
01:37:45,040 --> 01:37:47,189
assume and those experiences you
particularly mean

5852
01:37:47,189 --> 01:37:47,199
particularly mean
 

5853
01:37:47,199 --> 01:37:49,669
particularly mean
there's a subjectiveness to them that's

5854
01:37:49,669 --> 01:37:49,679
there's a subjectiveness to them that's
 

5855
01:37:49,679 --> 01:37:51,669
there's a subjectiveness to them that's
what's the thing when people refer to

5856
01:37:51,669 --> 01:37:51,679
what's the thing when people refer to
 

5857
01:37:51,679 --> 01:37:53,910
what's the thing when people refer to
the heart problem of consciousness

5858
01:37:53,910 --> 01:37:53,920
the heart problem of consciousness
 

5859
01:37:53,920 --> 01:37:56,390
the heart problem of consciousness
is it feels like something

5860
01:37:56,390 --> 01:37:56,400
is it feels like something
 

5861
01:37:56,400 --> 01:37:58,390
is it feels like something
to look at the color red okay exactly

5862
01:37:58,390 --> 01:37:58,400
to look at the color red okay exactly
 

5863
01:37:58,400 --> 01:37:59,910
to look at the color red okay exactly
right it feels like something to have a

5864
01:37:59,910 --> 01:37:59,920
right it feels like something to have a
 

5865
01:37:59,920 --> 01:38:01,750
right it feels like something to have a
headache or to feel

5866
01:38:01,750 --> 01:38:01,760
headache or to feel
 

5867
01:38:01,760 --> 01:38:03,270

there are experiences and they're

it's going to be just consciousness and

it's going to be just consciousness and
 

5979
01:39:51,920 --> 01:39:56,310
it's going to be just consciousness and
i presume human consciousness is a tiny

01:40:16,719 --> 01:40:17,830

i i don't have any good evidence

that's just a shout out

6004
01:40:23,270 --> 01:40:23,280
that's just a shout out
 

6005
01:40:23,280 --> 01:40:25,030
that's just a shout out
sorry to distract so that's the first

6006
01:40:25,030 --> 01:40:25,040
sorry to distract so that's the first
 

6007
01:40:25,040 --> 01:40:27,270
sorry to distract so that's the first
assumption first assumption that's right

6008
01:40:27,270 --> 01:40:27,280
assumption first assumption that's right
 

6009
01:40:27,280 --> 01:40:29,270
assumption first assumption that's right
the second assumption is that these

6010
01:40:29,270 --> 01:40:29,280
the second assumption is that these
 

6011
01:40:29,280 --> 01:40:31,590
the second assumption is that these
experiences have consequences

6012
01:40:31,590 --> 01:40:31,600
experiences have consequences
 

6013
01:40:31,600 --> 01:40:32,310
experiences have consequences
so

6014
01:40:32,310 --> 01:40:32,320
so
 

6015
01:40:32,320 --> 01:40:34,229
so
i'm going to say that conscious

6016
01:40:34,229 --> 01:40:34,239
i'm going to say that conscious
 

6017
01:40:34,239 --> 01:40:35,910
i'm going to say that conscious
experiences can trigger other conscious

6018
01:40:35,910 --> 01:40:35,920
experiences can trigger other conscious
 

6019
01:40:35,920 --> 01:40:38,310
experiences can trigger other conscious
experiences somehow

6020
01:40:38,310 --> 01:40:38,320
experiences somehow
 

6021
01:40:38,320 --> 01:40:39,270
experiences somehow
so

6022
01:40:39,270 --> 01:40:39,280
so
 

6023
01:40:39,280 --> 01:40:42,229
so
so really in some sense there there's

6024
01:40:42,229 --> 01:40:42,239
so really in some sense there there's
 

6025
01:40:42,239 --> 01:40:44,470
so really in some sense there there's
two basic assumptions there's some kind

6026
01:40:44,470 --> 01:40:44,480
two basic assumptions there's some kind
 

6027
01:40:44,480 --> 01:40:46,950
two basic assumptions there's some kind
of causality is there's a chain of

6028
01:40:46,950 --> 01:40:46,960
of causality is there's a chain of
 

6029
01:40:46,960 --> 01:40:50,070
of causality is there's a chain of
causality does this relate to dynamics

6030
01:40:50,070 --> 01:40:50,080
causality does this relate to dynamics
 

6031
01:40:50,080 --> 01:40:51,350
causality does this relate to dynamics
i'll say there's a probabilistic

6032
01:40:51,350 --> 01:40:51,360
i'll say there's a probabilistic
 

6033
01:40:51,360 --> 01:40:53,109
i'll say there's a probabilistic
relationship okay

6034
01:40:53,109 --> 01:40:53,119
relationship okay
 

6035
01:40:53,119 --> 01:40:54,870
relationship okay
um and then

6036
01:40:54,870 --> 01:40:54,880
um and then
 

6037
01:40:54,880 --> 01:40:56,550
um and then
so i'm trying to be

6038
01:40:56,550 --> 01:40:56,560
so i'm trying to be
 

6039
01:40:56,560 --> 01:40:59,109
so i'm trying to be
as non-specific to begin with and see

6040
01:40:59,109 --> 01:40:59,119
as non-specific to begin with and see
 

6041
01:40:59,119 --> 01:41:01,669
as non-specific to begin with and see
where it leads me so what i can write

6042
01:41:01,669 --> 01:41:01,679
where it leads me so what i can write
 

6043
01:41:01,679 --> 01:41:04,070
where it leads me so what i can write
down are probability spaces so

6044
01:41:04,070 --> 01:41:04,080
down are probability spaces so
 

6045
01:41:04,080 --> 01:41:06,629
down are probability spaces so
probability space which contains the

6046
01:41:06,629 --> 01:41:06,639
probability space which contains the
 

6047
01:41:06,639 --> 01:41:08,470
probability space which contains the
conscious experiences that this

6048
01:41:08,470 --> 01:41:08,480
conscious experiences that this
 

6049
01:41:08,480 --> 01:41:11,669
conscious experiences that this
consciousness can have so i i'll

6050
01:41:11,669 --> 01:41:11,679
consciousness can have so i i'll
 

6051
01:41:11,679 --> 01:41:14,470
consciousness can have so i i'll
i call this a conscious agent

6052
01:41:14,470 --> 01:41:14,480
i call this a conscious agent
 

6053
01:41:14,480 --> 01:41:16,709
i call this a conscious agent
this technical thing now i

6054
01:41:16,709 --> 01:41:16,719
this technical thing now i
 

6055
01:41:16,719 --> 01:41:19,109
this technical thing now i
annika harris and i've talked about this

6056
01:41:19,109 --> 01:41:19,119
annika harris and i've talked about this
 

6057
01:41:19,119 --> 01:41:21,350
annika harris and i've talked about this
and and she rightly

6058
01:41:21,350 --> 01:41:21,360
and and she rightly
 

6059
01:41:21,360 --> 01:41:22,870
and and she rightly
cautions me that people will think that

6060
01:41:22,870 --> 01:41:22,880
cautions me that people will think that
 

6061
01:41:22,880 --> 01:41:24,550
cautions me that people will think that
i'm bringing in a notion of a cell for

6062
01:41:24,550 --> 01:41:24,560
i'm bringing in a notion of a cell for
 

6063
01:41:24,560 --> 01:41:26,870
i'm bringing in a notion of a cell for
agency and so forth when i say conscious

6064
01:41:26,870 --> 01:41:26,880
agency and so forth when i say conscious
 

6065
01:41:26,880 --> 01:41:28,470
agency and so forth when i say conscious
agent so i just want to say that i use

6066
01:41:28,470 --> 01:41:28,480
agent so i just want to say that i use
 

6067
01:41:28,480 --> 01:41:30,550
agent so i just want to say that i use
the term conscious agent merely as a

6068
01:41:30,550 --> 01:41:30,560
the term conscious agent merely as a
 

6069
01:41:30,560 --> 01:41:33,350
the term conscious agent merely as a
technical term there is no notion of

6070
01:41:33,350 --> 01:41:33,360
technical term there is no notion of
 

6071
01:41:33,360 --> 01:41:35,669
technical term there is no notion of

conscious age there are only experiences

6074
01:41:38,709 --> 01:41:38,719
conscious age there are only experiences
 

6075
01:41:38,719 --> 01:41:41,350
conscious age there are only experiences
and probabilistic relationships that of

6076
01:41:41,350 --> 01:41:41,360
and probabilistic relationships that of
 

6077
01:41:41,360 --> 01:41:43,030
and probabilistic relationships that of
how they trigger other experiences so

6078
01:41:43,030 --> 01:41:43,040
how they trigger other experiences so
 

6079
01:41:43,040 --> 01:41:44,709
how they trigger other experiences so
the agent is the generator of the

conscious agents
 

6101
01:42:05,760 --> 01:42:07,990
conscious agents
okay including itself but you don't

6102
01:42:07,990 --> 01:42:08,000
okay including itself but you don't
 

6103
01:42:08,000 --> 01:42:10,629
okay including itself but you don't
think of that as a self no there there

6104
01:42:10,629 --> 01:42:10,639
think of that as a self no there there
 

6105
01:42:10,639 --> 01:42:13,750
think of that as a self no there there
is no notion of of a self here there's

6106
01:42:13,750 --> 01:42:13,760
is no notion of of a self here there's
 

6107
01:42:13,760 --> 01:42:17,350
is no notion of of a self here there's
no notion of of really of an agent

6108
01:42:17,350 --> 01:42:17,360
no notion of of really of an agent
 

6109
01:42:17,360 --> 01:42:20,229
no notion of of really of an agent
but is there a locality

6110
01:42:20,229 --> 01:42:20,239
but is there a locality
 

6111
01:42:20,239 --> 01:42:22,790
but is there a locality
is there an organization

6112
01:42:22,790 --> 01:42:22,800
is there an organization
 

6113
01:42:22,800 --> 01:42:25,510
is there an organization
so this is this is um these are

6114
01:42:25,510 --> 01:42:25,520
so this is this is um these are
 

6115
01:42:25,520 --> 01:42:26,790
so this is this is um these are
conscious

6116
01:42:26,790 --> 01:42:26,800
conscious
 

6117
01:42:26,800 --> 01:42:28,470
conscious
units conscious entities but they're

6118
01:42:28,470 --> 01:42:28,480
units conscious entities but they're
 

6119
01:42:28,480 --> 01:42:29,750
units conscious entities but they're
distinct

6120
01:42:29,750 --> 01:42:29,760
distinct
 

6121
01:42:29,760 --> 01:42:30,870
distinct
in some way because they have to

6122
01:42:30,870 --> 01:42:30,880
in some way because they have to
 

6123
01:42:30,880 --> 01:42:32,070
in some way because they have to
interact

6124
01:42:32,070 --> 01:42:32,080
interact
 

6125
01:42:32,080 --> 01:42:33,430
interact
well so here's the interesting thing

6126
01:42:33,430 --> 01:42:33,440
well so here's the interesting thing
 

6127
01:42:33,440 --> 01:42:35,990
well so here's the interesting thing
when we write down the mathematics um

6128
01:42:35,990 --> 01:42:36,000
when we write down the mathematics um
 

6129
01:42:36,000 --> 01:42:37,830
when we write down the mathematics um
when you have two of these conscious

6130
01:42:37,830 --> 01:42:37,840
when you have two of these conscious
 

6131
01:42:37,840 --> 01:42:41,590
when you have two of these conscious
agents interacting they s the the pair

6132
01:42:41,590 --> 01:42:41,600
agents interacting they s the the pair
 

6133
01:42:41,600 --> 01:42:43,189
agents interacting they s the the pair
satisfy the definition of a conscious

6134
01:42:43,189 --> 01:42:43,199
satisfy the definition of a conscious
 

6135
01:42:43,199 --> 01:42:44,950
satisfy the definition of a conscious
agent so they are a single conscious

6136
01:42:44,950 --> 01:42:44,960
agent so they are a single conscious
 

6137
01:42:44,960 --> 01:42:45,990
agent so they are a single conscious
agent

6138
01:42:45,990 --> 01:42:46,000
agent
 

6139
01:42:46,000 --> 01:42:48,550
agent
so there is one conscious agent yeah but

6140
01:42:48,550 --> 01:42:48,560
so there is one conscious agent yeah but
 

6141
01:42:48,560 --> 01:42:52,229
so there is one conscious agent yeah but
it it has a nice analytic decomposition

6142
01:42:52,229 --> 01:42:52,239
it it has a nice analytic decomposition
 

6143
01:42:52,239 --> 01:42:53,910
it it has a nice analytic decomposition
into as many conscious agents that's a

6144
01:42:53,910 --> 01:42:53,920
into as many conscious agents that's a
 

6145
01:42:53,920 --> 01:42:55,350
into as many conscious agents that's a
nice interface

6146
01:42:55,350 --> 01:42:55,360
nice interface
 

6147
01:42:55,360 --> 01:42:57,990
nice interface
it's a very useful scientific interface

6148
01:42:57,990 --> 01:42:58,000
it's a very useful scientific interface
 

6149
01:42:58,000 --> 01:43:01,030
it's a very useful scientific interface
yeah it's it's a scale-free or if you

6150
01:43:01,030 --> 01:43:01,040
yeah it's it's a scale-free or if you
 

6151
01:43:01,040 --> 01:43:02,629
yeah it's it's a scale-free or if you
like a fractal-like

6152
01:43:02,629 --> 01:43:02,639
like a fractal-like
 

6153
01:43:02,639 --> 01:43:04,870
like a fractal-like
approach to it in which we can use the

6154
01:43:04,870 --> 01:43:04,880
approach to it in which we can use the
 

6155
01:43:04,880 --> 01:43:08,070
approach to it in which we can use the
same unit of analysis at all scales in

6156
01:43:08,070 --> 01:43:08,080
same unit of analysis at all scales in
 

6157
01:43:08,080 --> 01:43:10,709
same unit of analysis at all scales in
in studying consciousness but if i want

6158
01:43:10,709 --> 01:43:10,719
in studying consciousness but if i want
 

6159
01:43:10,719 --> 01:43:12,149
in studying consciousness but if i want
to talk about

6160
01:43:12,149 --> 01:43:12,159
to talk about
 

6161
01:43:12,159 --> 01:43:14,790
to talk about
so there's no notion of learning

6162
01:43:14,790 --> 01:43:14,800
so there's no notion of learning
 

6163
01:43:14,800 --> 01:43:15,990
so there's no notion of learning
memory

6164
01:43:15,990 --> 01:43:16,000

6165
01:43:16,000 --> 01:43:19,270

6168
01:43:20,629 --> 01:43:20,639
agency
 

6169
01:43:20,639 --> 01:43:23,990
agency
so none of that is fundamental

6170
01:43:23,990 --> 01:43:24,000
so none of that is fundamental
 

6171
01:43:24,000 --> 01:43:26,229
so none of that is fundamental
so and the reason i did that was

6172
01:43:26,229 --> 01:43:26,239
so and the reason i did that was
 

6173
01:43:26,239 --> 01:43:27,189
so and the reason i did that was
because

6174
01:43:27,189 --> 01:43:27,199
because
 

6175
01:43:27,199 --> 01:43:29,750
because
i want to assume as little as possible

6176
01:43:29,750 --> 01:43:29,760
i want to assume as little as possible
 

6177
01:43:29,760 --> 01:43:31,430
i want to assume as little as possible
everything i assume is a miracle in the

6178
01:43:31,430 --> 01:43:31,440
everything i assume is a miracle in the

01:43:31,440 --> 01:43:33,350
everything i assume is a miracle in the

6181
01:43:33,360 --> 01:43:35,669
theory it's not something you explain is
something you assume so i have to build

6182
01:43:35,669 --> 01:43:35,679
something you assume so i have to build
 

6183
01:43:35,679 --> 01:43:38,629
something you assume so i have to build
networks of conscious agents

6184

6185
01:43:38,639 --> 01:43:39,910

if i want to have a notion of a self i

6186
01:43:39,910 --> 01:43:39,920
if i want to have a notion of a self i
 

6187
01:43:39,920 --> 01:43:41,350
if i want to have a notion of a self i
have to build a self

have to build a self
 

6189
01:43:41,360 --> 01:43:43,430
have to build a self
i have to build learning memory problem

my heart problem would go in the other

you would see neurons that's a data

you would see neurons that's a data
 

6397
01:47:03,600 --> 01:47:04,709
you would see neurons that's a data

as you look away you garbage collect

6402
01:47:09,109 --> 01:47:09,119
as you look away you garbage collect
 

6403
01:47:09,119 --> 01:47:10,629
as you look away you garbage collect
that data structure just like that necro

3d cube
 

6411
01:47:15,840 --> 01:47:17,669
3d cube
you create it on the fly as soon as you

01:47:17,669 --> 01:47:17,679
you create it on the fly as soon as you
 

6413
01:47:17,679 --> 01:47:18,709
you create it on the fly as soon as you
look away

that's gone when you say you you mean a

that's gone when you say you you mean a
 

6417
01:47:21,119 --> 01:47:22,870
that's gone when you say you you mean a
human being scientist

6418
01:47:22,870 --> 01:47:22,880
human being scientist
 

6419
01:47:22,880 --> 01:47:24,470
human being scientist
right now that's right

6420
01:47:24,470 --> 01:47:24,480
right now that's right
 

6421
01:47:24,480 --> 01:47:26,790
right now that's right
more generally it'll be conscious agents

6422
01:47:26,790 --> 01:47:26,800
more generally it'll be conscious agents
 

6423
01:47:26,800 --> 01:47:28,790
more generally it'll be conscious agents
because as you as you pointed out in my

6424
01:47:28,790 --> 01:47:28,800
because as you as you pointed out in my
 

6425
01:47:28,800 --> 01:47:29,910
because as you as you pointed out in my
asking

6426
01:47:29,910 --> 01:47:29,920
asking
 

6427
01:47:29,920 --> 01:47:31,189
asking
for a theory of conscience only about

6428
01:47:31,189 --> 01:47:31,199
for a theory of conscience only about
 

6429
01:47:31,199 --> 01:47:32,790
for a theory of conscience only about
humans no it's it's

6430
01:47:32,790 --> 01:47:32,800
humans no it's it's
 

6431
01:47:32,800 --> 01:47:34,790
humans no it's it's
consciousness which human consciousness

6432
01:47:34,790 --> 01:47:34,800
consciousness which human consciousness
 

6433
01:47:34,800 --> 01:47:36,870
consciousness which human consciousness
is just a tiny

6434
01:47:36,870 --> 01:47:36,880
is just a tiny
 

6435
01:47:36,880 --> 01:47:37,910
is just a tiny
sliver

6436
01:47:37,910 --> 01:47:37,920
sliver
 

6437
01:47:37,920 --> 01:47:39,990
sliver
so but you are saying that there is

6438
01:47:39,990 --> 01:47:40,000
so but you are saying that there is
 

6439
01:47:40,000 --> 01:47:42,229
so but you are saying that there is
that's a useful data structure how many

6440
01:47:42,229 --> 01:47:42,239
that's a useful data structure how many
 

6441
01:47:42,239 --> 01:47:43,830
that's a useful data structure how many
other data structures are there that's

6442
01:47:43,830 --> 01:47:43,840
other data structures are there that's
 

6443
01:47:43,840 --> 01:47:46,149
other data structures are there that's
why i said you human if there's another

6444
01:47:46,149 --> 01:47:46,159
why i said you human if there's another
 

6445
01:47:46,159 --> 01:47:47,350
why i said you human if there's another
earth

6446
01:47:47,350 --> 01:47:47,360
earth
 

6447
01:47:47,360 --> 01:47:49,590
earth
if there's another alien civilization

6448
01:47:49,590 --> 01:47:49,600
if there's another alien civilization
 

6449
01:47:49,600 --> 01:47:51,510
if there's another alien civilization
and doing these kinds of investigations

6450
01:47:51,510 --> 01:47:51,520
and doing these kinds of investigations
 

6451
01:47:51,520 --> 01:47:52,790
and doing these kinds of investigations
would they come up with similar data

6452
01:47:52,790 --> 01:47:52,800
would they come up with similar data
 

6453
01:47:52,800 --> 01:47:54,149
would they come up with similar data
structures

6454
01:47:54,149 --> 01:47:54,159
structures
 

6455
01:47:54,159 --> 01:47:56,070
structures
probably not what is the space of data

6456
01:47:56,070 --> 01:47:56,080
probably not what is the space of data
 

6457
01:47:56,080 --> 01:47:59,830
probably not what is the space of data
structures i guess is what i'm asking um

6458
01:47:59,830 --> 01:47:59,840
structures i guess is what i'm asking um
 

6459
01:47:59,840 --> 01:48:01,510
structures i guess is what i'm asking um
my my guess is that

6460
01:48:01,510 --> 01:48:01,520
my my guess is that
 

6461
01:48:01,520 --> 01:48:02,830
my my guess is that
if consciousness is

6462
01:48:02,830 --> 01:48:02,840
if consciousness is
 

6463
01:48:02,840 --> 01:48:04,790
if consciousness is
fundamental consciousness is all there

6464
01:48:04,790 --> 01:48:04,800
fundamental consciousness is all there
 

6465
01:48:04,800 --> 01:48:07,109
fundamental consciousness is all there
is

6466
01:48:07,109 --> 01:48:07,119

 

6467
01:48:07,119 --> 01:48:07,910

then

6468
01:48:07,910 --> 01:48:07,920
then
 

6469
01:48:07,920 --> 01:48:09,189
then
the only thing

6470
01:48:09,189 --> 01:48:09,199
the only thing
 

6471
01:48:09,199 --> 01:48:10,870
the only thing
that mathematical structure can be about

6472
01:48:10,870 --> 01:48:10,880
that mathematical structure can be about
 

6473
01:48:10,880 --> 01:48:15,510
that mathematical structure can be about
is possibilities of consciousness

6474
01:48:15,510 --> 01:48:15,520

 

6475
01:48:15,520 --> 01:48:16,390

and

6476
01:48:16,390 --> 01:48:16,400
and
 

6477
01:48:16,400 --> 01:48:18,310
and
that suggests to me that there could be

6478
01:48:18,310 --> 01:48:18,320
that suggests to me that there could be
 

6479
01:48:18,320 --> 01:48:21,109
that suggests to me that there could be
an infinite variety of consciousnesses

6480
01:48:21,109 --> 01:48:21,119
an infinite variety of consciousnesses
 

6481
01:48:21,119 --> 01:48:22,310
an infinite variety of consciousnesses
and

6482
01:48:22,310 --> 01:48:22,320
and
 

6483
01:48:22,320 --> 01:48:23,590
and
a

data structures and the kinds of
 

6491
01:48:28,080 --> 01:48:29,510

6492
01:48:29,510 --> 01:48:29,520

6493
01:48:29,520 --> 01:48:31,189

there's an infinite variety of data

6494
01:48:31,189 --> 01:48:31,199
there's an infinite variety of data

there's an infinite variety of data
structures now this is very similar to

multiverse idea he thinks that
 

6505
01:48:40,880 --> 01:48:42,950
multiverse idea he thinks that
mathematics is fundamental

6506
01:48:42,950 --> 01:48:42,960
mathematics is fundamental
 

6507
01:48:42,960 --> 01:48:44,470
mathematics is fundamental
and and so that's the fundamental

6508
01:48:44,470 --> 01:48:44,480
and and so that's the fundamental
 

6509
01:48:44,480 --> 01:48:45,990
and and so that's the fundamental
reality and since there's an infinite

i'm saying something

01:48:54,310 --> 01:48:54,320
i'm saying something
 

6521
01:48:54,320 --> 01:48:55,910
i'm saying something

different there's an infinite variety of

mathematical structures absolutely

6526
01:49:00,550 --> 01:49:00,560
mathematical structures absolutely
 

6527
01:49:00,560 --> 01:49:02,149
mathematical structures absolutely
but mathematics isn't the fundamental

6528
01:49:02,149 --> 01:49:02,159
but mathematics isn't the fundamental
 

6529
01:49:02,159 --> 01:49:04,790
but mathematics isn't the fundamental
reality in this in this framework

6530
01:49:04,790 --> 01:49:04,800
reality in this in this framework
 

6531
01:49:04,800 --> 01:49:06,470
reality in this in this framework
consciousness is

6532
01:49:06,470 --> 01:49:06,480
consciousness is
 

6533
01:49:06,480 --> 01:49:09,189
consciousness is
and mathematics is to consciousness

6534
01:49:09,189 --> 01:49:09,199
and mathematics is to consciousness
 

6535
01:49:09,199 --> 01:49:11,750
and mathematics is to consciousness
like bones are to an organism

6536
01:49:11,750 --> 01:49:11,760
like bones are to an organism
 

6537
01:49:11,760 --> 01:49:14,310
like bones are to an organism
you need the bones so mathematics is is

6538
01:49:14,310 --> 01:49:14,320
you need the bones so mathematics is is
 

6539
01:49:14,320 --> 01:49:16,629
you need the bones so mathematics is is
not divorced from consciousness but it's

6540
01:49:16,629 --> 01:49:16,639
not divorced from consciousness but it's
 

6541
01:49:16,639 --> 01:49:17,510
not divorced from consciousness but it's
not

6542
01:49:17,510 --> 01:49:17,520
not
 

6543
01:49:17,520 --> 01:49:19,030
not
the entirety of consciousness by any

6544
01:49:19,030 --> 01:49:19,040
the entirety of consciousness by any
 

6545
01:49:19,040 --> 01:49:20,229
the entirety of consciousness by any
means

6546
01:49:20,229 --> 01:49:20,239
means
 

6547
01:49:20,239 --> 01:49:22,390
means
and so there's an infinite variety of of

6548
01:49:22,390 --> 01:49:22,400
and so there's an infinite variety of of
 

6549
01:49:22,400 --> 01:49:25,350
and so there's an infinite variety of of
conscious consciousnesses and and

6550
01:49:25,350 --> 01:49:25,360
conscious consciousnesses and and
 

6551
01:49:25,360 --> 01:49:27,109
conscious consciousnesses and and
signaling games that consciousnesses

6552
01:49:27,109 --> 01:49:27,119
signaling games that consciousnesses
 

6553
01:49:27,119 --> 01:49:28,870
signaling games that consciousnesses
could interact

6554
01:49:28,870 --> 01:49:28,880
could interact
 

6555
01:49:28,880 --> 01:49:29,990
could interact
via

6556
01:49:29,990 --> 01:49:30,000
via
 

6557
01:49:30,000 --> 01:49:31,990
via
and therefore worlds you know common

6558
01:49:31,990 --> 01:49:32,000
and therefore worlds you know common
 

6559
01:49:32,000 --> 01:49:34,229
and therefore worlds you know common
worlds data structures

6560
01:49:34,229 --> 01:49:34,239
worlds data structures
 

6561
01:49:34,239 --> 01:49:37,109
worlds data structures
that they can use to to communicate

6562
01:49:37,109 --> 01:49:37,119
that they can use to to communicate
 

6563
01:49:37,119 --> 01:49:38,870
that they can use to to communicate
so space and time is just one of an

6564
01:49:38,870 --> 01:49:38,880
so space and time is just one of an
 

6565
01:49:38,880 --> 01:49:41,510
so space and time is just one of an
infinite variety and so i i think that

6566
01:49:41,510 --> 01:49:41,520
infinite variety and so i i think that
 

6567
01:49:41,520 --> 01:49:43,669
infinite variety and so i i think that
what we'll what we'll find is that as we

6568
01:49:43,669 --> 01:49:43,679
what we'll what we'll find is that as we
 

6569
01:49:43,679 --> 01:49:45,510
what we'll what we'll find is that as we
go outside of our little space-time

6570
01:49:45,510 --> 01:49:45,520
go outside of our little space-time
 

6571
01:49:45,520 --> 01:49:46,790
go outside of our little space-time

we will encounter

01:49:50,400 --> 01:49:52,070
we will encounter

that's just one color i'm asking for
just a color we we actually know by the

just a color we we actually know by the

um called tetraphams
 

6605
01:50:21,440 --> 01:50:24,470
um called tetraphams
um who have four color receptors

6606
01:50:24,470 --> 01:50:24,480
um who have four color receptors
 

6607
01:50:24,480 --> 01:50:25,750
um who have four color receptors
not just three

01:50:25,750 --> 01:50:25,760
not just three
 

6609
01:50:25,760 --> 01:50:28,149
not just three
and kimberly jamison and others who

6610
01:50:28,149 --> 01:50:28,159
and kimberly jamison and others who
 

6611
01:50:28,159 --> 01:50:29,910
and kimberly jamison and others who
studied these women have good evidence

6612
01:50:29,910 --> 01:50:29,920
studied these women have good evidence
 

6613
01:50:29,920 --> 01:50:31,589
studied these women have good evidence
that they apparently have a new

6614

that they apparently have a new
 

6615
01:50:31,599 --> 01:50:34,470
that they apparently have a new
dimension of color experience

6616
01:50:34,470 --> 01:50:34,480
dimension of color experience
 

6617
01:50:34,480 --> 01:50:37,030
dimension of color experience
that the rest of us don't have so so

6618
01:50:37,030 --> 01:50:37,040
that the rest of us don't have so so
 

6619
01:50:37,040 --> 01:50:39,430
that the rest of us don't have so so
these women are apparently living in a

6620
01:50:39,430 --> 01:50:39,440
these women are apparently living in a
 

6621
01:50:39,440 --> 01:50:41,830
these women are apparently living in a
world of color that you and i can't even

6622
01:50:41,830 --> 01:50:41,840
world of color that you and i can't even
 

6623
01:50:41,840 --> 01:50:43,270
world of color that you and i can't even
concretely imagine no man can imagine

6624
01:50:43,270 --> 01:50:43,280
concretely imagine no man can imagine
 

6625
01:50:43,280 --> 01:50:46,470
concretely imagine no man can imagine
them yeah and and yet they're real color

6626
01:50:46,470 --> 01:50:46,480
them yeah and and yet they're real color
 

6627
01:50:46,480 --> 01:50:48,390
them yeah and and yet they're real color
experiences and so in that sense i'm

6628
01:50:48,390 --> 01:50:48,400
experiences and so in that sense i'm
 

6629
01:50:48,400 --> 01:50:51,350
experiences and so in that sense i'm
saying now take that little baby step oh

6630
01:50:51,350 --> 01:50:51,360
saying now take that little baby step oh
 

6631
01:50:51,360 --> 01:50:52,709
saying now take that little baby step oh
there are women who have color

6632
01:50:52,709 --> 01:50:52,719
there are women who have color
 

6633
01:50:52,719 --> 01:50:54,070
there are women who have color
experiences that i could never have well

6634
01:50:54,070 --> 01:50:54,080
experiences that i could never have well
 

6635
01:50:54,080 --> 01:50:55,189
experiences that i could never have well
that's shocking

6636
01:50:55,189 --> 01:50:55,199
that's shocking
 

6637
01:50:55,199 --> 01:50:56,709
that's shocking
now take that

6638
01:50:56,709 --> 01:50:56,719
now take that
 

6639
01:50:56,719 --> 01:50:57,669
now take that

there are consciousnesses

01:51:05,360 --> 01:51:07,750

yet these are all possible varieties of

conscious experience when you say
 

6655
01:51:11,679 --> 01:51:13,430
conscious experience when you say
there's a lot of consciousnesses it's a

there's a lot of consciousnesses it's a
 

6657
01:51:13,440 --> 01:51:16,390
there's a lot of consciousnesses it's a
singular consciousness

ability to have new experiences that's

01:51:34,070 --> 01:51:34,080
ability to have new experiences that's
 

6677
01:51:34,080 --> 01:51:36,629
ability to have new experiences that's
somehow a different consciousness is

6678
01:51:36,629 --> 01:51:36,639
somehow a different consciousness is
 

6679
01:51:36,639 --> 01:51:38,870
somehow a different consciousness is
there a way to see that as all the same

6680
01:51:38,870 --> 01:51:38,880
there a way to see that as all the same
 

6681
01:51:38,880 --> 01:51:41,430
there a way to see that as all the same
consciousness the subjectivity itself

6682
01:51:41,430 --> 01:51:41,440
consciousness the subjectivity itself
 

6683
01:51:41,440 --> 01:51:43,430
consciousness the subjectivity itself
right because when we have

6684
01:51:43,430 --> 01:51:43,440
right because when we have
 

6685
01:51:43,440 --> 01:51:45,109
right because when we have
two of these conscious agents

6686
01:51:45,109 --> 01:51:45,119
two of these conscious agents
 

6687
01:51:45,119 --> 01:51:46,790
two of these conscious agents
interacting in the mathematics they

6688
01:51:46,790 --> 01:51:46,800
interacting in the mathematics they
 

6689
01:51:46,800 --> 01:51:48,629
interacting in the mathematics they
actually satisfy the definition of a

6690
01:51:48,629 --> 01:51:48,639
actually satisfy the definition of a
 

6691
01:51:48,639 --> 01:51:50,229
actually satisfy the definition of a
conscious agent so in fact they are a

6692
01:51:50,229 --> 01:51:50,239
conscious agent so in fact they are a
 

6693
01:51:50,239 --> 01:51:52,149
conscious agent so in fact they are a
single conscious agent

6694
01:51:52,149 --> 01:51:52,159
single conscious agent
 

6695
01:51:52,159 --> 01:51:53,830
single conscious agent
so so in fact

6696
01:51:53,830 --> 01:51:53,840
so so in fact
 

6697
01:51:53,840 --> 01:51:55,030
so so in fact
one way to think about what i'm saying

6698
01:51:55,030 --> 01:51:55,040
one way to think about what i'm saying
 

6699
01:51:55,040 --> 01:51:57,189
one way to think about what i'm saying
i'm postulating with my colleagues

6700
01:51:57,189 --> 01:51:57,199
i'm postulating with my colleagues

there is one big conscious agent

6706
01:52:03,510 --> 01:52:03,520
there is one big conscious agent
 

6707
01:52:03,520 --> 01:52:05,189
there is one big conscious agent
infinitely complicated

6708
01:52:05,189 --> 01:52:05,199
infinitely complicated
 

6709
01:52:05,199 --> 01:52:06,629
infinitely complicated
but fortunately

6710
01:52:06,629 --> 01:52:06,639
but fortunately
 

6711
01:52:06,639 --> 01:52:08,550
but fortunately
we can for analytic purposes break it

6712
01:52:08,550 --> 01:52:08,560
we can for analytic purposes break it
 

6713
01:52:08,560 --> 01:52:10,709
we can for analytic purposes break it
down all the way to in some sense the

6714
01:52:10,709 --> 01:52:10,719
down all the way to in some sense the
 

6715
01:52:10,719 --> 01:52:12,390
down all the way to in some sense the
simplest conscious agent which has one

6716
01:52:12,390 --> 01:52:12,400
simplest conscious agent which has one
 

6717
01:52:12,400 --> 01:52:14,709
simplest conscious agent which has one
conscious experience one

6718
01:52:14,709 --> 01:52:14,719
conscious experience one
 

6719
01:52:14,719 --> 01:52:16,550
conscious experience one
i like this this one agent can

6720
01:52:16,550 --> 01:52:16,560
i like this this one agent can
 

6721
01:52:16,560 --> 01:52:18,709
i like this this one agent can
experience red 35 that's it that's what

6722
01:52:18,709 --> 01:52:18,719
experience red 35 that's it that's what
 

6723
01:52:18,719 --> 01:52:20,470
experience red 35 that's it that's what
that's what it experiences you can get

6724
01:52:20,470 --> 01:52:20,480
that's what it experiences you can get
 

6725
01:52:20,480 --> 01:52:22,709
that's what it experiences you can get
all the way down to that

6726
01:52:22,709 --> 01:52:22,719
all the way down to that
 

6727
01:52:22,719 --> 01:52:25,189
all the way down to that
so you think it's possible

6728
01:52:25,189 --> 01:52:25,199
so you think it's possible
 

6729
01:52:25,199 --> 01:52:27,589
so you think it's possible
that consciousness

6730
01:52:27,589 --> 01:52:27,599
that consciousness
 

6731
01:52:27,599 --> 01:52:28,830
that consciousness
whatever that

6732
01:52:28,830 --> 01:52:28,840
whatever that
 

6733
01:52:28,840 --> 01:52:31,990
whatever that
is is uh

6734
01:52:31,990 --> 01:52:32,000
is is uh
 

6735
01:52:32,000 --> 01:52:34,470
is is uh
much more is fundamental or at least

6736
01:52:34,470 --> 01:52:34,480
much more is fundamental or at least
 

6737
01:52:34,480 --> 01:52:36,149
much more is fundamental or at least
much more in the direction of the

01:52:36,159 --> 01:52:37,430
much more in the direction of the

01:52:40,310 --> 01:52:40,320
than his space time as we perceive it
 

6743
01:52:40,320 --> 01:52:42,390
than his space time as we perceive it
that's the proposal

6744
01:52:42,390 --> 01:52:42,400
that's the proposal
 

6745
01:52:42,400 --> 01:52:45,270
that's the proposal
and therefore what i have to do in terms

6746
01:52:45,270 --> 01:52:45,280
and therefore what i have to do in terms
 

6747
01:52:45,280 --> 01:52:47,430
and therefore what i have to do in terms
of the heart problem of consciousness

6748
01:52:47,430 --> 01:52:47,440
of the heart problem of consciousness
 

6749
01:52:47,440 --> 01:52:48,709
of the heart problem of consciousness
is to show

is to show
 

6751
01:52:48,719 --> 01:52:51,030
is to show
how dynamical systems of conscious

6752
01:52:51,030 --> 01:52:51,040
how dynamical systems of conscious
 

6753
01:52:51,040 --> 01:52:53,510
how dynamical systems of conscious
agents could lead to what we call space

6754
01:52:53,510 --> 01:52:53,520
agents could lead to what we call space
 

6755
01:52:53,520 --> 01:52:55,030
agents could lead to what we call space
and time and neurons

6756
01:52:55,030 --> 01:52:55,040
and time and neurons
 

6757
01:52:55,040 --> 01:52:56,470
and time and neurons
and brain activity

6758
01:52:56,470 --> 01:52:56,480
and brain activity
 

6759
01:52:56,480 --> 01:52:58,550
and brain activity
in other words we have to show

6760
01:52:58,550 --> 01:52:58,560
in other words we have to show
 

6761
01:52:58,560 --> 01:53:01,109
in other words we have to show
how you get space-time and

6762
01:53:01,109 --> 01:53:01,119
how you get space-time and
 

6763
01:53:01,119 --> 01:53:03,430
how you get space-time and
physical objects

6764
01:53:03,430 --> 01:53:03,440
physical objects
 

6765
01:53:03,440 --> 01:53:05,830
physical objects
in entirely from a theory of conscious

6766
01:53:05,830 --> 01:53:05,840
in entirely from a theory of conscious
 

6767
01:53:05,840 --> 01:53:07,750
in entirely from a theory of conscious
agents outside of space time with the

6768
01:53:07,750 --> 01:53:07,760
agents outside of space time with the
 

6769
01:53:07,760 --> 01:53:10,390
agents outside of space time with the
dynamics outside of space-time

6770
01:53:10,390 --> 01:53:10,400
dynamics outside of space-time
 

6771
01:53:10,400 --> 01:53:12,390
dynamics outside of space-time
so that's that's and i can tell you how

6772
01:53:12,390 --> 01:53:12,400
so that's that's and i can tell you how
 

6773
01:53:12,400 --> 01:53:14,470
so that's that's and i can tell you how
we plan to to do that but but that's

6774
01:53:14,470 --> 01:53:14,480
we plan to to do that but but that's
 

6775
01:53:14,480 --> 01:53:15,669
we plan to to do that but but that's
that's the idea

6776
01:53:15,669 --> 01:53:15,679
that's the idea
 

6777
01:53:15,679 --> 01:53:17,910
that's the idea
okay the magic of it that chocolate is

6778
01:53:17,910 --> 01:53:17,920
okay the magic of it that chocolate is
 

6779
01:53:17,920 --> 01:53:19,750
okay the magic of it that chocolate is
delicious

6780
01:53:19,750 --> 01:53:19,760
delicious
 

6781
01:53:19,760 --> 01:53:22,390
delicious
so so there's a mathematical kind of

6782
01:53:22,390 --> 01:53:22,400
so so there's a mathematical kind of
 

6783
01:53:22,400 --> 01:53:23,910
so so there's a mathematical kind of
thing that we could say here how it can

6784
01:53:23,910 --> 01:53:23,920
thing that we could say here how it can
 

6785
01:53:23,920 --> 01:53:26,790
thing that we could say here how it can
emerge within the system of networks of

6786
01:53:26,790 --> 01:53:26,800
emerge within the system of networks of
 

6787
01:53:26,800 --> 01:53:28,629
emerge within the system of networks of
conscience agents but

6788
01:53:28,629 --> 01:53:28,639
conscience agents but
 

6789
01:53:28,639 --> 01:53:31,109
conscience agents but
um

6790
01:53:31,109 --> 01:53:31,119

 

6791
01:53:31,119 --> 01:53:33,030

is there going to be at the end of of

6792
01:53:33,030 --> 01:53:33,040
is there going to be at the end of of
 

6793
01:53:33,040 --> 01:53:36,629
is there going to be at the end of of
the proof why chocolate is so delicious

6794
01:53:36,629 --> 01:53:36,639
the proof why chocolate is so delicious
 

6795
01:53:36,639 --> 01:53:40,229
the proof why chocolate is so delicious
or or no i guess i'm going to ask

6796
01:53:40,229 --> 01:53:40,239
or or no i guess i'm going to ask
 

6797
01:53:40,239 --> 01:53:42,149
or or no i guess i'm going to ask
different kinds of dumb questions to try

6798
01:53:42,149 --> 01:53:42,159
different kinds of dumb questions to try
 

6799
01:53:42,159 --> 01:53:44,229
different kinds of dumb questions to try
to sneak up oh well that's the right

6800
01:53:44,229 --> 01:53:44,239
to sneak up oh well that's the right
 

6801
01:53:44,239 --> 01:53:45,990
to sneak up oh well that's the right
question and when i say that i took

6802
01:53:45,990 --> 01:53:46,000
question and when i say that i took
 

6803
01:53:46,000 --> 01:53:47,910
question and when i say that i took
conscious experiences as fundamental

6804
01:53:47,910 --> 01:53:47,920
conscious experiences as fundamental
 

6805
01:53:47,920 --> 01:53:50,070
conscious experiences as fundamental
what that means is in the current

6806
01:53:50,070 --> 01:53:50,080
what that means is in the current
 

6807
01:53:50,080 --> 01:53:52,709
what that means is in the current
version of my theory i'm not explaining

6808
01:53:52,709 --> 01:53:52,719
version of my theory i'm not explaining
 

6809
01:53:52,719 --> 01:53:54,470
version of my theory i'm not explaining
conscious experiences where they came

6810
01:53:54,470 --> 01:53:54,480
conscious experiences where they came
 

6811
01:53:54,480 --> 01:53:55,510
conscious experiences where they came
from

6812
01:53:55,510 --> 01:53:55,520
from
 

6813
01:53:55,520 --> 01:53:57,030
from
that's the miracle that's one of the

6814
01:53:57,030 --> 01:53:57,040
that's the miracle that's one of the
 

6815
01:53:57,040 --> 01:53:59,109
that's the miracle that's one of the
miracles so i have two miracles in my

6816
01:53:59,109 --> 01:53:59,119
miracles so i have two miracles in my
 

6817
01:53:59,119 --> 01:54:00,550
miracles so i have two miracles in my
theory there are conscious experiences

6818
01:54:00,550 --> 01:54:00,560
theory there are conscious experiences
 

6819
01:54:00,560 --> 01:54:02,229
theory there are conscious experiences
like the taste of chocolate

6820
01:54:02,229 --> 01:54:02,239
like the taste of chocolate
 

6821
01:54:02,239 --> 01:54:03,030
like the taste of chocolate
and

6822
01:54:03,030 --> 01:54:03,040
and
 

6823
01:54:03,040 --> 01:54:04,709
and
that the

6824
01:54:04,709 --> 01:54:04,719
that the
 

6825
01:54:04,719 --> 01:54:06,070
that the
there's a probabilistic relationship

6826
01:54:06,070 --> 01:54:06,080
there's a probabilistic relationship
 

6827
01:54:06,080 --> 01:54:08,470
there's a probabilistic relationship
when certain conscious experiences occur

6828
01:54:08,470 --> 01:54:08,480
when certain conscious experiences occur
 

6829
01:54:08,480 --> 01:54:10,470
when certain conscious experiences occur
others are more likely to occur

6830
01:54:10,470 --> 01:54:10,480
others are more likely to occur
 

6831
01:54:10,480 --> 01:54:12,470
others are more likely to occur
those are the two miracles that

6832
01:54:12,470 --> 01:54:12,480
those are the two miracles that
 

6833
01:54:12,480 --> 01:54:14,310
those are the two miracles that
are possible to

6834
01:54:14,310 --> 01:54:14,320
are possible to
 

6835
01:54:14,320 --> 01:54:16,550
are possible to
get beyond

6836
01:54:16,550 --> 01:54:16,560
get beyond
 

6837
01:54:16,560 --> 01:54:17,430
get beyond
that

6838
01:54:17,430 --> 01:54:17,440
that
 

6839
01:54:17,440 --> 01:54:19,750
that
and somehow start to chip away at the

6840
01:54:19,750 --> 01:54:19,760
and somehow start to chip away at the
 

6841
01:54:19,760 --> 01:54:22,470
and somehow start to chip away at the
miracleness of that miracle that

6842
01:54:22,470 --> 01:54:22,480
miracleness of that miracle that
 

6843
01:54:22,480 --> 01:54:25,430
miracleness of that miracle that
chocolate is still delicious i hope so

6844
01:54:25,430 --> 01:54:25,440
chocolate is still delicious i hope so
 

6845
01:54:25,440 --> 01:54:26,790
chocolate is still delicious i hope so
i've got my hands full with what i'm

6846
01:54:26,790 --> 01:54:26,800
i've got my hands full with what i'm
 

6847
01:54:26,800 --> 01:54:29,030
i've got my hands full with what i'm
doing right now but but the

6848
01:54:29,030 --> 01:54:29,040
doing right now but but the
 

6849
01:54:29,040 --> 01:54:31,510
doing right now but but the
i can just say at top level how i would

6850
01:54:31,510 --> 01:54:31,520
i can just say at top level how i would
 

6851
01:54:31,520 --> 01:54:37,910
i can just say at top level how i would
think about that that would get at this

6852
01:54:37,910 --> 01:54:37,920

 

6853
01:54:37,920 --> 01:54:41,990

consciousness without form

6854
01:54:41,990 --> 01:54:42,000

 

6855
01:54:42,000 --> 01:54:43,430

this is going to be really this is

6856
01:54:43,430 --> 01:54:43,440
this is going to be really this is
 

6857
01:54:43,440 --> 01:54:45,430
this is going to be really this is
really tough because it's

6858
01:54:45,430 --> 01:54:45,440
really tough because it's
 

6859
01:54:45,440 --> 01:54:47,109
really tough because it's
consciousness without form versus the

6860
01:54:47,109 --> 01:54:47,119
consciousness without form versus the
 

6861
01:54:47,119 --> 01:54:49,430
consciousness without form versus the
various forms that consciousness

6862
01:54:49,430 --> 01:54:49,440
various forms that consciousness
 

6863
01:54:49,440 --> 01:54:53,350
various forms that consciousness
takes for the experiences that it has

6864
01:54:53,350 --> 01:54:53,360
takes for the experiences that it has
 

6865
01:54:53,360 --> 01:54:54,950
takes for the experiences that it has
right right

6866
01:54:54,950 --> 01:54:54,960
right right
 

6867
01:54:54,960 --> 01:54:56,149
right right
so there's

6868
01:54:56,149 --> 01:54:56,159
so there's
 

6869
01:54:56,159 --> 01:54:59,109
so there's
so when i write down

6870
01:54:59,109 --> 01:54:59,119

 

6871
01:54:59,119 --> 01:55:01,189

a probability space

6872
01:55:01,189 --> 01:55:01,199
a probability space
 

6873
01:55:01,199 --> 01:55:03,189
a probability space
for these conscious experience i say

6874
01:55:03,189 --> 01:55:03,199
for these conscious experience i say
 

6875
01:55:03,199 --> 01:55:04,310
for these conscious experience i say
here's a probability space for the

6876
01:55:04,310 --> 01:55:04,320
here's a probability space for the
 

6877
01:55:04,320 --> 01:55:06,070
here's a probability space for the
possible conscious experiences

6878
01:55:06,070 --> 01:55:06,080
possible conscious experiences
 

6879
01:55:06,080 --> 01:55:06,870
possible conscious experiences
right

6880
01:55:06,870 --> 01:55:06,880
right
 

6881
01:55:06,880 --> 01:55:07,910
right
it's just like when i write down a

6882
01:55:07,910 --> 01:55:07,920
it's just like when i write down a
 

6883
01:55:07,920 --> 01:55:09,750
it's just like when i write down a
probability space for an experiment like

6884
01:55:09,750 --> 01:55:09,760
probability space for an experiment like
 

6885
01:55:09,760 --> 01:55:10,790
probability space for an experiment like
i'm going to flip

6886
01:55:10,790 --> 01:55:10,800
i'm going to flip
 

6887
01:55:10,800 --> 01:55:12,070
i'm going to flip
a coin twice

6888
01:55:12,070 --> 01:55:12,080
a coin twice
 

6889
01:55:12,080 --> 01:55:13,910
a coin twice
right and i want to look at the

6890
01:55:13,910 --> 01:55:13,920
right and i want to look at the
 

6891
01:55:13,920 --> 01:55:15,109
right and i want to look at the
probabilities of various outcomes so i

6892
01:55:15,109 --> 01:55:15,119
probabilities of various outcomes so i
 

6893
01:55:15,119 --> 01:55:16,229
probabilities of various outcomes so i
have to write down the probability space

6894
01:55:16,229 --> 01:55:16,239
have to write down the probability space
 

6895
01:55:16,239 --> 01:55:18,470
have to write down the probability space
there could be heads heads heads tails

6896
01:55:18,470 --> 01:55:18,480
there could be heads heads heads tails
 

6897
01:55:18,480 --> 01:55:20,310
there could be heads heads heads tails
tails heads tails tails

6898
01:55:20,310 --> 01:55:20,320
tails heads tails tails
 

6899
01:55:20,320 --> 01:55:22,390
tails heads tails tails
so you before as

6900
01:55:22,390 --> 01:55:22,400
so you before as
 

6901
01:55:22,400 --> 01:55:23,910
so you before as
any class and probability you're told

6902
01:55:23,910 --> 01:55:23,920
any class and probability you're told
 

6903
01:55:23,920 --> 01:55:25,350
any class and probability you're told
write down your probability space if you

6904
01:55:25,350 --> 01:55:25,360
write down your probability space if you
 

6905
01:55:25,360 --> 01:55:26,629
write down your probability space if you
don't write down your probability space

6906
01:55:26,629 --> 01:55:26,639
don't write down your probability space
 

6907
01:55:26,639 --> 01:55:27,990
don't write down your probability space
you can't get started

6908
01:55:27,990 --> 01:55:28,000
you can't get started
 

6909
01:55:28,000 --> 01:55:29,430
you can't get started
so here's my probability space for

6910
01:55:29,430 --> 01:55:29,440
so here's my probability space for
 

6911
01:55:29,440 --> 01:55:31,589
so here's my probability space for
consciousness how do i want to interpret

6912
01:55:31,589 --> 01:55:31,599
consciousness how do i want to interpret
 

6913
01:55:31,599 --> 01:55:33,109
consciousness how do i want to interpret
that structure

6914
01:55:33,109 --> 01:55:33,119
that structure
 

6915
01:55:33,119 --> 01:55:34,390
that structure
the structure is just sitting there

6916
01:55:34,390 --> 01:55:34,400
the structure is just sitting there
 

6917
01:55:34,400 --> 01:55:36,070
the structure is just sitting there
there's going to be a dynamics that

6918
01:55:36,070 --> 01:55:36,080
there's going to be a dynamics that
 

6919
01:55:36,080 --> 01:55:38,550
there's going to be a dynamics that
happens on it right experiences appear

6920
01:55:38,550 --> 01:55:38,560
happens on it right experiences appear
 

6921
01:55:38,560 --> 01:55:39,990
happens on it right experiences appear
and then it disappear just like heads

6922
01:55:39,990 --> 01:55:40,000
and then it disappear just like heads
 

6923
01:55:40,000 --> 01:55:41,910
and then it disappear just like heads
appears and disappears

6924
01:55:41,910 --> 01:55:41,920
appears and disappears
 

6925
01:55:41,920 --> 01:55:42,950
appears and disappears
so

6926
01:55:42,950 --> 01:55:42,960
so
 

6927
01:55:42,960 --> 01:55:43,910
so
so

6928
01:55:43,910 --> 01:55:43,920
so
 

6929
01:55:43,920 --> 01:55:46,229
so
one way to think about that fundamental

6930
01:55:46,229 --> 01:55:46,239
one way to think about that fundamental
 

6931
01:55:46,239 --> 01:55:48,550
one way to think about that fundamental
probability space is that

6932
01:55:48,550 --> 01:55:48,560
probability space is that
 

6933
01:55:48,560 --> 01:55:50,550
probability space is that
corresponds to consciousness without any

6934
01:55:50,550 --> 01:55:50,560
corresponds to consciousness without any
 

6935
01:55:50,560 --> 01:55:52,870
corresponds to consciousness without any
content

6936
01:55:52,870 --> 01:55:52,880
content
 

6937
01:55:52,880 --> 01:55:55,350
content
the infinite consciousness

6938
01:55:55,350 --> 01:55:55,360
the infinite consciousness
 

6939
01:55:55,360 --> 01:55:56,950
the infinite consciousness
that transcends

6940
01:55:56,950 --> 01:55:56,960
that transcends
 

6941
01:55:56,960 --> 01:55:58,629
that transcends
any particular content

6942
01:55:58,629 --> 01:55:58,639
any particular content
 

6943
01:55:58,639 --> 01:56:00,470
any particular content
well do you think of that as a mechanism

6944
01:56:00,470 --> 01:56:00,480
well do you think of that as a mechanism
 

6945
01:56:00,480 --> 01:56:02,390
well do you think of that as a mechanism
as a thing

6946
01:56:02,390 --> 01:56:02,400
as a thing
 

6947
01:56:02,400 --> 01:56:04,790
as a thing
like the the rules that govern the

6948
01:56:04,790 --> 01:56:04,800
like the the rules that govern the
 

6949
01:56:04,800 --> 01:56:06,790
like the the rules that govern the
dynamics of the thing

6950
01:56:06,790 --> 01:56:06,800
dynamics of the thing
 

6951
01:56:06,800 --> 01:56:09,350
dynamics of the thing
outside of space time isn't that if you

6952
01:56:09,350 --> 01:56:09,360
outside of space time isn't that if you
 

6953
01:56:09,360 --> 01:56:10,790
outside of space time isn't that if you
think consciousness is fundamental isn't

6954
01:56:10,790 --> 01:56:10,800
think consciousness is fundamental isn't
 

6955
01:56:10,800 --> 01:56:12,790
think consciousness is fundamental isn't
it essentially getting like

6956
01:56:12,790 --> 01:56:12,800
it essentially getting like
 

6957
01:56:12,800 --> 01:56:14,870
it essentially getting like
it is solving the hard problem

6958
01:56:14,870 --> 01:56:14,880
it is solving the hard problem
 

6959
01:56:14,880 --> 01:56:16,709
it is solving the hard problem
which is like

6960
01:56:16,709 --> 01:56:16,719
which is like
 

6961
01:56:16,719 --> 01:56:18,310
which is like
from uh

6962
01:56:18,310 --> 01:56:18,320
from uh
 

6963
01:56:18,320 --> 01:56:20,790
from uh
where does this thing pop up

6964
01:56:20,790 --> 01:56:20,800
where does this thing pop up
 

6965
01:56:20,800 --> 01:56:22,629
where does this thing pop up
which is the mechanism of the thing

6966
01:56:22,629 --> 01:56:22,639
which is the mechanism of the thing
 

6967
01:56:22,639 --> 01:56:24,149
which is the mechanism of the thing
popping up

6968
01:56:24,149 --> 01:56:24,159
popping up
 

6969
01:56:24,159 --> 01:56:25,750
popping up
whatever the consciousness is the

6970
01:56:25,750 --> 01:56:25,760
whatever the consciousness is the
 

6971
01:56:25,760 --> 01:56:27,990
whatever the consciousness is the
different kinds it was so on that

6972
01:56:27,990 --> 01:56:28,000
different kinds it was so on that
 

6973
01:56:28,000 --> 01:56:29,510
different kinds it was so on that
mechanism

6974
01:56:29,510 --> 01:56:29,520
mechanism
 

6975
01:56:29,520 --> 01:56:31,430
mechanism
and also the the question i want to ask

6976
01:56:31,430 --> 01:56:31,440
and also the the question i want to ask
 

6977
01:56:31,440 --> 01:56:32,390
and also the the question i want to ask
is uh

6978
01:56:32,390 --> 01:56:32,400
is uh
 

6979
01:56:32,400 --> 01:56:33,350
is uh
how

6980
01:56:33,350 --> 01:56:33,360
how
 

6981
01:56:33,360 --> 01:56:35,990
how
how tricky do you think it is

6982
01:56:35,990 --> 01:56:36,000
how tricky do you think it is
 

6983
01:56:36,000 --> 01:56:38,070
how tricky do you think it is
to solve that problem

6984
01:56:38,070 --> 01:56:38,080
to solve that problem
 

6985
01:56:38,080 --> 01:56:40,070
to solve that problem
you solved a lot of difficult problems

6986
01:56:40,070 --> 01:56:40,080
you solved a lot of difficult problems
 

6987
01:56:40,080 --> 01:56:42,790
you solved a lot of difficult problems
throughout the history of humanity

6988
01:56:42,790 --> 01:56:42,800
throughout the history of humanity
 

6989
01:56:42,800 --> 01:56:44,870
throughout the history of humanity
there's probably

6990
01:56:44,870 --> 01:56:44,880
there's probably
 

6991
01:56:44,880 --> 01:56:47,030
there's probably
more problems to solve

6992
01:56:47,030 --> 01:56:47,040
more problems to solve
 

6993
01:56:47,040 --> 01:56:49,109
more problems to solve
left than we've solved

6994
01:56:49,109 --> 01:56:49,119
left than we've solved
 

6995
01:56:49,119 --> 01:56:50,310
left than we've solved
by like

6996
01:56:50,310 --> 01:56:50,320
by like
 

6997
01:56:50,320 --> 01:56:52,229
by like
an infinity

6998
01:56:52,229 --> 01:56:52,239
an infinity
 

6999
01:56:52,239 --> 01:56:55,350
an infinity
uh but along that long journey

7000
01:56:55,350 --> 01:56:55,360
uh but along that long journey
 

7001
01:56:55,360 --> 01:56:58,149
uh but along that long journey
of intelligent species

7002
01:56:58,149 --> 01:56:58,159
of intelligent species
 

7003
01:56:58,159 --> 01:56:59,830
of intelligent species
how when when we solve this

7004
01:56:59,830 --> 01:56:59,840
how when when we solve this
 

7005
01:56:59,840 --> 01:57:01,589
how when when we solve this
consciousness one which is one way to

7006
01:57:01,589 --> 01:57:01,599
consciousness one which is one way to
 

7007
01:57:01,599 --> 01:57:03,910
consciousness one which is one way to
measure the difficulty of the problem

7008
01:57:03,910 --> 01:57:03,920
measure the difficulty of the problem
 

7009
01:57:03,920 --> 01:57:05,990
measure the difficulty of the problem
so i'll give two answers there's one

7010
01:57:05,990 --> 01:57:06,000
so i'll give two answers there's one
 

7011
01:57:06,000 --> 01:57:08,470
so i'll give two answers there's one
problem i think we can solve

7012
01:57:08,470 --> 01:57:08,480
problem i think we can solve
 

7013
01:57:08,480 --> 01:57:10,390
problem i think we can solve
but we haven't solved yet and that is

7014
01:57:10,390 --> 01:57:10,400
but we haven't solved yet and that is
 

7015
01:57:10,400 --> 01:57:12,149
but we haven't solved yet and that is
the reverse of what

7016
01:57:12,149 --> 01:57:12,159

how how much we were able to do with so

7180
01:59:53,589 --> 01:59:53,599
how how much we were able to do with so
 

7181
01:59:53,599 --> 01:59:55,990
how how much we were able to do with so
little but uh outside of that

7182
01:59:55,990 --> 01:59:56,000
little but uh outside of that
 

7183
01:59:56,000 --> 01:59:58,950
little but uh outside of that
it will all be just uh the silliness

7184
01:59:58,950 --> 01:59:58,960
it will all be just uh the silliness
 

7185
01:59:58,960 --> 02:00:01,589
it will all be just uh the silliness
will be entertainment for a teenager

7186
02:00:01,589 --> 02:00:01,599
will be entertainment for a teenager
 

7187
02:00:01,599 --> 02:00:02,950
will be entertainment for a teenager
especially the silliness when we thought

7188
02:00:02,950 --> 02:00:02,960
especially the silliness when we thought
 

7189
02:00:02,960 --> 02:00:05,830
especially the silliness when we thought
that we were so smart and we knew it all

7190
02:00:05,830 --> 02:00:05,840
that we were so smart and we knew it all
 

7191
02:00:05,840 --> 02:00:07,189
that we were so smart and we knew it all
so it would be interesting to explore

7192
02:00:07,189 --> 02:00:07,199
so it would be interesting to explore
 

7193
02:00:07,199 --> 02:00:10,310
so it would be interesting to explore
your ideas by contrasting

7194
02:00:10,310 --> 02:00:10,320
your ideas by contrasting
 

7195
02:00:10,320 --> 02:00:12,550
your ideas by contrasting
you mentioned annika monica harris you

7196
02:00:12,550 --> 02:00:12,560
you mentioned annika monica harris you
 

7197
02:00:12,560 --> 02:00:15,510
you mentioned annika monica harris you
mentioned um phil goff

7198
02:00:15,510 --> 02:00:15,520
mentioned um phil goff
 

7199
02:00:15,520 --> 02:00:17,669
mentioned um phil goff
so outside of if you're not allowed to

7200
02:00:17,669 --> 02:00:17,679
so outside of if you're not allowed to
 

7201
02:00:17,679 --> 02:00:19,430
so outside of if you're not allowed to
say

7202
02:00:19,430 --> 02:00:19,440
say
 

7203
02:00:19,440 --> 02:00:21,510
say
the fundamental disagreement is the fact

7204
02:00:21,510 --> 02:00:21,520
the fundamental disagreement is the fact
 

7205
02:00:21,520 --> 02:00:23,589
the fundamental disagreement is the fact
that space time is fundamental

7206
02:00:23,589 --> 02:00:23,599
that space time is fundamental
 

7207
02:00:23,599 --> 02:00:25,830
that space time is fundamental
um what are interesting

7208
02:00:25,830 --> 02:00:25,840
um what are interesting
 

7209
02:00:25,840 --> 02:00:27,589
um what are interesting
distinctions between ideas of

7210
02:00:27,589 --> 02:00:27,599
distinctions between ideas of
 

7211
02:00:27,599 --> 02:00:29,430
distinctions between ideas of
consciousness between you and hanukkah

7212
02:00:29,430 --> 02:00:29,440
consciousness between you and hanukkah
 

7213
02:00:29,440 --> 02:00:31,990
consciousness between you and hanukkah
for example you guys have uh you've been

7214
02:00:31,990 --> 02:00:32,000
for example you guys have uh you've been
 

7215
02:00:32,000 --> 02:00:34,470
for example you guys have uh you've been
on a podcast together i'm sure

7216
02:00:34,470 --> 02:00:34,480
on a podcast together i'm sure
 

7217
02:00:34,480 --> 02:00:36,870
on a podcast together i'm sure
in in in in private you guys have some

7218
02:00:36,870 --> 02:00:36,880
in in in in private you guys have some
 

7219
02:00:36,880 --> 02:00:39,430
in in in in private you guys have some
incredible conversations so what where

7220
02:00:39,430 --> 02:00:39,440
incredible conversations so what where
 

7221
02:00:39,440 --> 02:00:41,109
incredible conversations so what where
are some sticky interesting sticking

7222
02:00:41,109 --> 02:00:41,119
are some sticky interesting sticking
 

7223
02:00:41,119 --> 02:00:42,310
are some sticky interesting sticking
points some

7224
02:00:42,310 --> 02:00:42,320
points some
 

7225
02:00:42,320 --> 02:00:44,790
points some
interesting disagreements let's say with

7226
02:00:44,790 --> 02:00:44,800
interesting disagreements let's say with
 

7227
02:00:44,800 --> 02:00:46,470
interesting disagreements let's say with
annika first maybe there'll be a few

7228
02:00:46,470 --> 02:00:46,480
annika first maybe there'll be a few
 

7229
02:00:46,480 --> 02:00:48,390
annika first maybe there'll be a few
other people well annika and i just had

7230
02:00:48,390 --> 02:00:48,400
other people well annika and i just had
 

7231
02:00:48,400 --> 02:00:49,830
other people well annika and i just had
a conversation this morning where we

7232
02:00:49,830 --> 02:00:49,840
a conversation this morning where we
 

7233
02:00:49,840 --> 02:00:52,070
a conversation this morning where we
were talking about our ideas and what we

7234
02:00:52,070 --> 02:00:52,080
were talking about our ideas and what we
 

7235
02:00:52,080 --> 02:00:53,669
were talking about our ideas and what we
discovered really in our conversation

7236
02:00:53,669 --> 02:00:53,679
discovered really in our conversation
 

7237
02:00:53,679 --> 02:00:55,109
discovered really in our conversation
was that um

7238
02:00:55,109 --> 02:00:55,119
was that um
 

7239
02:00:55,119 --> 02:00:57,109
was that um
we're pretty much on the same page it

7240
02:00:57,109 --> 02:00:57,119
we're pretty much on the same page it
 

7241
02:00:57,119 --> 02:00:58,870
we're pretty much on the same page it
was really just

7242
02:00:58,870 --> 02:00:58,880
was really just
 

7243
02:00:58,880 --> 02:01:00,790
was really just
consciousness unconsciousness yeah we're

7244
02:01:00,790 --> 02:01:00,800
consciousness unconsciousness yeah we're
 

7245
02:01:00,800 --> 02:01:02,310
consciousness unconsciousness yeah we're
our ideas about consciousness are pretty

7246
02:01:02,310 --> 02:01:02,320
our ideas about consciousness are pretty
 

7247
02:01:02,320 --> 02:01:04,070
our ideas about consciousness are pretty
much on the same page

7248
02:01:04,070 --> 02:01:04,080
much on the same page
 

7249
02:01:04,080 --> 02:01:05,030
much on the same page
she

7250
02:01:05,030 --> 02:01:05,040
she
 

7251
02:01:05,040 --> 02:01:08,149
she
rightly has cautioned me to when i talk

7252
02:01:08,149 --> 02:01:08,159
rightly has cautioned me to when i talk
 

7253
02:01:08,159 --> 02:01:09,990
rightly has cautioned me to when i talk
about conscious agents

7254
02:01:09,990 --> 02:01:10,000
about conscious agents
 

7255
02:01:10,000 --> 02:01:11,910
about conscious agents
to point out that the notion of agency

7256
02:01:11,910 --> 02:01:11,920
to point out that the notion of agency
 

7257
02:01:11,920 --> 02:01:14,390
to point out that the notion of agency
is not for is not fundamental in my my

7258
02:01:14,390 --> 02:01:14,400
is not for is not fundamental in my my
 

7259
02:01:14,400 --> 02:01:15,589
is not for is not fundamental in my my
theory

7260
02:01:15,589 --> 02:01:15,599
theory
 

7261
02:01:15,599 --> 02:01:17,189
theory
the notion of self is not fundamental

7262
02:01:17,189 --> 02:01:17,199
the notion of self is not fundamental
 

7263
02:01:17,199 --> 02:01:19,669
the notion of self is not fundamental
that's that's absolutely true i can use

7264
02:01:19,669 --> 02:01:19,679
that's that's absolutely true i can use
 

7265
02:01:19,679 --> 02:01:22,149
that's that's absolutely true i can use
this network of conscious agents this

7266
02:01:22,149 --> 02:01:22,159
this network of conscious agents this
 

7267
02:01:22,159 --> 02:01:23,910
this network of conscious agents this
and i now use tech

7268
02:01:23,910 --> 02:01:23,920
and i now use tech
 

7269
02:01:23,920 --> 02:01:25,750
and i now use tech
as a technical term conscious agent is a

7270
02:01:25,750 --> 02:01:25,760
as a technical term conscious agent is a
 

7271
02:01:25,760 --> 02:01:27,030
as a technical term conscious agent is a
technical term for that probability

7272
02:01:27,030 --> 02:01:27,040
technical term for that probability
 

7273
02:01:27,040 --> 02:01:29,189
technical term for that probability
space with the markovian dynamics

7274
02:01:29,189 --> 02:01:29,199
space with the markovian dynamics
 

7275
02:01:29,199 --> 02:01:31,669
space with the markovian dynamics
i can use that to build models of a self

7276
02:01:31,669 --> 02:01:31,679
i can use that to build models of a self
 

7277
02:01:31,679 --> 02:01:33,350
i can use that to build models of a self
and to build models of agency but

7278
02:01:33,350 --> 02:01:33,360
and to build models of agency but
 

7279
02:01:33,360 --> 02:01:35,350
and to build models of agency but
they're not they're not fundamental so

7280
02:01:35,350 --> 02:01:35,360
they're not they're not fundamental so
 

7281
02:01:35,360 --> 02:01:37,270
they're not they're not fundamental so
she she has

helping me to be a little bit clear
 

7287
02:01:42,639 --> 02:01:44,390
helping me to be a little bit clear
about these ideas and not say things

7288
02:01:44,390 --> 02:01:44,400
about these ideas and not say things
 

7289
02:01:44,400 --> 02:01:45,830
about these ideas and not say things
that are misleading

7290
02:01:45,830 --> 02:01:45,840
that are misleading
 

7291
02:01:45,840 --> 02:01:47,750
that are misleading
sure the word i mean this is the

7292
02:01:47,750 --> 02:01:47,760
sure the word i mean this is the
 

7293
02:01:47,760 --> 02:01:48,950
sure the word i mean this is the
interesting thing about language

7294
02:01:48,950 --> 02:01:48,960
interesting thing about language
 

7295
02:01:48,960 --> 02:01:51,750
interesting thing about language
actually is that language quite

7296
02:01:51,750 --> 02:01:51,760
actually is that language quite
 

7297
02:01:51,760 --> 02:01:53,910
actually is that language quite
obviously is an interface

7298
02:01:53,910 --> 02:01:53,920
obviously is an interface
 

7299
02:01:53,920 --> 02:01:56,550
obviously is an interface
yes um to truth

individual words
 

7305
02:02:01,280 --> 02:02:02,830
individual words
can have so

7306
02:02:02,830 --> 02:02:02,840
can have so
 

7307
02:02:02,840 --> 02:02:05,589
can have so
much ambiguity

7308
02:02:05,589 --> 02:02:05,599
much ambiguity
 

7309
02:02:05,599 --> 02:02:08,870
much ambiguity
and the the and the slight the

particular sentence within the context
 

7315
02:02:12,800 --> 02:02:15,910
particular sentence within the context
of a sentence can have so much uh such a

of a sentence can have so much uh such a
 

7317
02:02:15,920 --> 02:02:17,510
of a sentence can have so much uh such a
difference in meaning it's quite

7318
02:02:17,510 --> 02:02:17,520
difference in meaning it's quite
 

7319
02:02:17,520 --> 02:02:18,470
difference in meaning it's quite
fascinating

7320
02:02:18,470 --> 02:02:18,480
fascinating
 

7321
02:02:18,480 --> 02:02:19,750
fascinating
especially when you're talking about

7322
02:02:19,750 --> 02:02:19,760
especially when you're talking about
 

7323
02:02:19,760 --> 02:02:22,149
especially when you're talking about
topics like consciousness

7324
02:02:22,149 --> 02:02:22,159
topics like consciousness
 

7325
02:02:22,159 --> 02:02:24,149
topics like consciousness
because it's a very loaded term it means

7326
02:02:24,149 --> 02:02:24,159
because it's a very loaded term it means
 

7327
02:02:24,159 --> 02:02:26,070
because it's a very loaded term it means
a lot of things to a lot of people

7328
02:02:26,070 --> 02:02:26,080
a lot of things to a lot of people
 

7329
02:02:26,080 --> 02:02:28,229
a lot of things to a lot of people
and the entire concept is shrouded or

7330
02:02:28,229 --> 02:02:28,239
and the entire concept is shrouded or
 

7331
02:02:28,239 --> 02:02:30,550
and the entire concept is shrouded or
mystery so combination of the fact that

7332
02:02:30,550 --> 02:02:30,560
mystery so combination of the fact that
 

7333
02:02:30,560 --> 02:02:32,950
mystery so combination of the fact that
it's a loaded term and that there's a

7334
02:02:32,950 --> 02:02:32,960
it's a loaded term and that there's a
 

7335
02:02:32,960 --> 02:02:34,229
it's a loaded term and that there's a
lot of mystery

7336
02:02:34,229 --> 02:02:34,239
lot of mystery
 

7337
02:02:34,239 --> 02:02:35,750
lot of mystery
people can just interpret it in all

7338
02:02:35,750 --> 02:02:35,760
people can just interpret it in all
 

7339
02:02:35,760 --> 02:02:38,390
people can just interpret it in all
kinds of ways and so you have to be both

7340
02:02:38,390 --> 02:02:38,400

um given x2 xn minus 1 given x2

7506
02:05:41,750 --> 02:05:41,760
um given x2 xn minus 1 given x2
 

7507
02:05:41,760 --> 02:05:43,910
um given x2 xn minus 1 given x2
by the markov property

7508
02:05:43,910 --> 02:05:43,920
by the markov property
 

7509
02:05:43,920 --> 02:05:45,510
by the markov property
and then because it's

7510
02:05:45,510 --> 02:05:45,520
and then because it's
 

7511
02:05:45,520 --> 02:05:47,669
and then because it's
stationary it's equal to

7512
02:05:47,669 --> 02:05:47,679
stationary it's equal to
 

7513
02:05:47,679 --> 02:05:49,910
stationary it's equal to
uh h of x um

7514
02:05:49,910 --> 02:05:49,920
uh h of x um
 

7515
02:05:49,920 --> 02:05:51,589
uh h of x um
um

7516
02:05:51,589 --> 02:05:51,599
um
 

7517
02:05:51,599 --> 02:05:54,310
um
i have to write it down next time sure

7518
02:05:54,310 --> 02:05:54,320
i have to write it down next time sure
 

7519
02:05:54,320 --> 02:05:56,709
i have to write it down next time sure
right anyway there's a three-line proof

7520
02:05:56,709 --> 02:05:56,719
right anyway there's a three-line proof
 

7521
02:05:56,719 --> 02:05:57,830
right anyway there's a three-line proof
sure

7522
02:05:57,830 --> 02:05:57,840
sure
 

7523
02:05:57,840 --> 02:05:58,950
sure
so

7524
02:05:58,950 --> 02:05:58,960
so
 

7525
02:05:58,960 --> 02:06:02,149
so
but the assumption of stationarity

7526
02:06:02,149 --> 02:06:02,159
but the assumption of stationarity
 

7527
02:06:02,159 --> 02:06:03,270
but the assumption of stationarity
we're using a lot of times that people

7528
02:06:03,270 --> 02:06:03,280
we're using a lot of times that people
 

7529
02:06:03,280 --> 02:06:05,910
we're using a lot of times that people
will understand right doesn't matter the

7530
02:06:05,910 --> 02:06:05,920
will understand right doesn't matter the
 

7531
02:06:05,920 --> 02:06:06,870
will understand right doesn't matter the
uh

7532
02:06:06,870 --> 02:06:06,880
uh
 

7533
02:06:06,880 --> 02:06:09,589
uh
so there's some kind of some markovian

7534
02:06:09,589 --> 02:06:09,599
so there's some kind of some markovian
 

7535
02:06:09,599 --> 02:06:11,189
so there's some kind of some markovian
dynamics is uh

7536
02:06:11,189 --> 02:06:11,199
dynamics is uh
 

7537
02:06:11,199 --> 02:06:13,030
dynamics is uh
basically trying to model some kind of

7538
02:06:13,030 --> 02:06:13,040
basically trying to model some kind of
 

7539
02:06:13,040 --> 02:06:14,709
basically trying to model some kind of
system with some probabilities and

7540
02:06:14,709 --> 02:06:14,719
system with some probabilities and
 

7541
02:06:14,719 --> 02:06:16,550
system with some probabilities and
there's agents and they interact in some

7542
02:06:16,550 --> 02:06:16,560
there's agents and they interact in some
 

7543
02:06:16,560 --> 02:06:18,550
there's agents and they interact in some
kind of way and you can say something

7544
02:06:18,550 --> 02:06:18,560
kind of way and you can say something
 

7545
02:06:18,560 --> 02:06:21,510
kind of way and you can say something
about that system as it involves uh

7546
02:06:21,510 --> 02:06:21,520
about that system as it involves uh
 

7547
02:06:21,520 --> 02:06:24,709
about that system as it involves uh
stationarity so a stationary

7548
02:06:24,709 --> 02:06:24,719
stationarity so a stationary
 

7549
02:06:24,719 --> 02:06:26,069
stationarity so a stationary
uh

7550
02:06:26,069 --> 02:06:26,079
uh
 

7551
02:06:26,079 --> 02:06:27,510
uh
system is one that has certain

7552
02:06:27,510 --> 02:06:27,520
system is one that has certain
 

7553
02:06:27,520 --> 02:06:30,709
system is one that has certain
properties in terms of entropy very well

7554
02:06:30,709 --> 02:06:30,719
properties in terms of entropy very well
 

7555
02:06:30,719 --> 02:06:32,870
properties in terms of entropy very well
but we don't know if it's stationary now

7556
02:06:32,870 --> 02:06:32,880
but we don't know if it's stationary now
 

7557
02:06:32,880 --> 02:06:34,870
but we don't know if it's stationary now
we don't know what properties

7558
02:06:34,870 --> 02:06:34,880
we don't know what properties
 

7559
02:06:34,880 --> 02:06:37,510
we don't know what properties
uh right uh you have to kind of take

7560
02:06:37,510 --> 02:06:37,520
uh right uh you have to kind of take
 

7561
02:06:37,520 --> 02:06:39,589
uh right uh you have to kind of take
assumptions and see okay well what is

7562
02:06:39,589 --> 02:06:39,599
assumptions and see okay well what is
 

7563
02:06:39,599 --> 02:06:41,910
assumptions and see okay well what is
what does the systems behave like

7564
02:06:41,910 --> 02:06:41,920
what does the systems behave like
 

7565
02:06:41,920 --> 02:06:44,229
what does the systems behave like
under these different properties the the

7566
02:06:44,229 --> 02:06:44,239
under these different properties the the
 

7567
02:06:44,239 --> 02:06:45,830
under these different properties the the
more constraints the more assumptions

7568
02:06:45,830 --> 02:06:45,840
more constraints the more assumptions
 

7569
02:06:45,840 --> 02:06:48,149
more constraints the more assumptions
you take the more predictive the more

7570
02:06:48,149 --> 02:06:48,159
you take the more predictive the more
 

7571
02:06:48,159 --> 02:06:49,750
you take the more predictive the more
interesting powerful things you can say

7572
02:06:49,750 --> 02:06:49,760
interesting powerful things you can say
 

7573
02:06:49,760 --> 02:06:52,069
interesting powerful things you can say
but sometimes the limiting

7574
02:06:52,069 --> 02:06:52,079

the whole technical technical thing was
 

7625

the whole technical technical thing was
to say this

to say this
 

7627
02:07:52,400 --> 02:07:54,950
to say this

certainly time is a limited resource and

7652
02:08:21,350 --> 02:08:21,360
certainly time is a limited resource and
 

7653
02:08:21,360 --> 02:08:22,950
certainly time is a limited resource and

something that this theory must do
at some point is to show how networks of

7668
02:08:41,910 --> 02:08:41,920
at some point is to show how networks of
 

7669
02:08:41,920 --> 02:08:44,149
at some point is to show how networks of
conscious agents even if they're not

7670
02:08:44,149 --> 02:08:44,159
conscious agents even if they're not
 

7671
02:08:44,159 --> 02:08:46,390
conscious agents even if they're not
resource limited give rise to evolution

7672
02:08:46,390 --> 02:08:46,400
resource limited give rise to evolution
 

7673
02:08:46,400 --> 02:08:49,189
resource limited give rise to evolution
by natural selection via a projection

7674
02:08:49,189 --> 02:08:49,199
by natural selection via a projection
 

7675
02:08:49,199 --> 02:08:51,030
by natural selection via a projection
yeah but you're saying

7676
02:08:51,030 --> 02:08:51,040
yeah but you're saying
 

7677
02:08:51,040 --> 02:08:52,629
yeah but you're saying
i'm trying to understand how the limited

7678
02:08:52,629 --> 02:08:52,639
i'm trying to understand how the limited
 

7679
02:08:52,639 --> 02:08:54,629
i'm trying to understand how the limited
resources that give rise to

7680
02:08:54,629 --> 02:08:54,639
resources that give rise to
 

7681
02:08:54,639 --> 02:08:55,669
resources that give rise to
um

7682
02:08:55,669 --> 02:08:55,679
um
 

7683
02:08:55,679 --> 02:08:57,750
um
so first the thing gives rise to time

7684
02:08:57,750 --> 02:08:57,760
so first the thing gives rise to time
 

7685
02:08:57,760 --> 02:08:59,830
so first the thing gives rise to time
that gives rise to limited resource that

7686
02:08:59,830 --> 02:08:59,840
that gives rise to limited resource that
 

7687
02:08:59,840 --> 02:09:01,350
that gives rise to limited resource that
gives rise to

7688
02:09:01,350 --> 02:09:01,360
gives rise to
 

7689
02:09:01,360 --> 02:09:03,350
gives rise to
evolution by natural selection how that

7690
02:09:03,350 --> 02:09:03,360
evolution by natural selection how that
 

7691
02:09:03,360 --> 02:09:04,709
evolution by natural selection how that
has to do with the fact that chocolate

7692
02:09:04,709 --> 02:09:04,719
has to do with the fact that chocolate
 

7693
02:09:04,719 --> 02:09:05,830
has to do with the fact that chocolate
is delicious

7694
02:09:05,830 --> 02:09:05,840
is delicious
 

7695
02:09:05,840 --> 02:09:07,589
is delicious
well well it's it's not going to do that

7696
02:09:07,589 --> 02:09:07,599
well well it's it's not going to do that
 

7697
02:09:07,599 --> 02:09:09,109
well well it's it's not going to do that
directly it's going to get to this

7698
02:09:09,109 --> 02:09:09,119
directly it's going to get to this
 

7699
02:09:09,119 --> 02:09:11,350
directly it's going to get to this
notion of self so oh oh it's going to

7700
02:09:11,350 --> 02:09:11,360
notion of self so oh oh it's going to
 

7701
02:09:11,360 --> 02:09:13,350
notion of self so oh oh it's going to
give you the notion of so evolution

7702
02:09:13,350 --> 02:09:13,360
give you the notion of so evolution
 

7703
02:09:13,360 --> 02:09:14,950
give you the notion of so evolution
gives you the notion of self

7704
02:09:14,950 --> 02:09:14,960
gives you the notion of self
 

7705
02:09:14,960 --> 02:09:17,270
gives you the notion of self
and also of of of a self separate from

7706
02:09:17,270 --> 02:09:17,280
and also of of of a self separate from
 

7707
02:09:17,280 --> 02:09:19,910
and also of of of a self separate from
other selves so so the idea would be

7708
02:09:19,910 --> 02:09:19,920
other selves so so the idea would be
 

7709
02:09:19,920 --> 02:09:22,229
other selves so so the idea would be
that competition has life and death all

7710
02:09:22,229 --> 02:09:22,239
that competition has life and death all
 

7711
02:09:22,239 --> 02:09:24,310
that competition has life and death all
those kinds of things that's right so it

7712
02:09:24,310 --> 02:09:24,320
those kinds of things that's right so it
 

7713
02:09:24,320 --> 02:09:26,550
those kinds of things that's right so it
it won't i i don't think

7714
02:09:26,550 --> 02:09:26,560
it won't i i don't think
 

7715
02:09:26,560 --> 02:09:28,229
it won't i i don't think
as i said i don't think that i can tell

7716
02:09:28,229 --> 02:09:28,239
as i said i don't think that i can tell
 

7717
02:09:28,239 --> 02:09:30,229
as i said i don't think that i can tell
you how the formless gives rise to the

7718
02:09:30,229 --> 02:09:30,239
you how the formless gives rise to the
 

7719
02:09:30,239 --> 02:09:32,229
you how the formless gives rise to the
experience of chocolate

7720
02:09:32,229 --> 02:09:32,239
experience of chocolate
 

7721
02:09:32,239 --> 02:09:33,910
experience of chocolate
right now my current theory says that's

7722
02:09:33,910 --> 02:09:33,920
right now my current theory says that's
 

7723
02:09:33,920 --> 02:09:35,589
right now my current theory says that's
that's one of the miracles i'm assuming

7724
02:09:35,589 --> 02:09:35,599
that's one of the miracles i'm assuming
 

7725
02:09:35,599 --> 02:09:38,149
that's one of the miracles i'm assuming
yeah that's so my theory can't do it and

7726
02:09:38,149 --> 02:09:38,159
yeah that's so my theory can't do it and
 

7727
02:09:38,159 --> 02:09:39,270
yeah that's so my theory can't do it and
the reason my theory can't do it is

7728
02:09:39,270 --> 02:09:39,280
the reason my theory can't do it is
 

7729
02:09:39,280 --> 02:09:40,550
the reason my theory can't do it is
because hoffman's brain can't do it

7730
02:09:40,550 --> 02:09:40,560
because hoffman's brain can't do it
 

7731
02:09:40,560 --> 02:09:40,970
because hoffman's brain can't do it
right now

7732
02:09:40,970 --> 02:09:40,980
right now
 

7733
02:09:40,980 --> 02:09:42,790
right now
[Laughter]

7734
02:09:42,790 --> 02:09:42,800
[Laughter]
 

7735
02:09:42,800 --> 02:09:44,830
[Laughter]
but but the notion of self

7736
02:09:44,830 --> 02:09:44,840
but but the notion of self
 

7737
02:09:44,840 --> 02:09:47,589
but but the notion of self
yes the notion of self can be an

7738
02:09:47,589 --> 02:09:47,599
yes the notion of self can be an
 

7739
02:09:47,599 --> 02:09:48,950
yes the notion of self can be an
artifact

7740
02:09:48,950 --> 02:09:48,960
artifact
 

7741
02:09:48,960 --> 02:09:50,790
artifact
of the projection

7742
02:09:50,790 --> 02:09:50,800
of the projection
 

7743
02:09:50,800 --> 02:09:51,669
of the projection
of a

7744
02:09:51,669 --> 02:09:51,679
of a
 

7745
02:09:51,679 --> 02:09:55,109
of a
so there's one conscious agent

7746
02:09:55,109 --> 02:09:55,119
so there's one conscious agent
 

7747
02:09:55,119 --> 02:09:56,390
so there's one conscious agent
because any time conscious agents

7748
02:09:56,390 --> 02:09:56,400
because any time conscious agents
 

7749
02:09:56,400 --> 02:09:57,750
because any time conscious agents
interact they form a new conscious agent

7750
02:09:57,750 --> 02:09:57,760
interact they form a new conscious agent
 

7751
02:09:57,760 --> 02:10:00,470
interact they form a new conscious agent
so there's one conscious agent any

7752
02:10:00,470 --> 02:10:00,480
so there's one conscious agent any
 

7753
02:10:00,480 --> 02:10:02,550
so there's one conscious agent any
projection of that one conscious agent

7754
02:10:02,550 --> 02:10:02,560
projection of that one conscious agent
 

7755
02:10:02,560 --> 02:10:04,310
projection of that one conscious agent
gives rise

7756
02:10:04,310 --> 02:10:04,320
gives rise
 

7757
02:10:04,320 --> 02:10:06,069
gives rise
to time even if there wasn't any time in

7758
02:10:06,069 --> 02:10:06,079
to time even if there wasn't any time in
 

7759
02:10:06,079 --> 02:10:07,669
to time even if there wasn't any time in
that one conscious agent

7760
02:10:07,669 --> 02:10:07,679
that one conscious agent
 

7761
02:10:07,679 --> 02:10:10,149
that one conscious agent
and it gives rise i i want to now i

7762
02:10:10,149 --> 02:10:10,159
and it gives rise i i want to now i
 

7763
02:10:10,159 --> 02:10:11,830
and it gives rise i i want to now i
haven't proven this so this is so now

7764
02:10:11,830 --> 02:10:11,840
haven't proven this so this is so now
 

7765
02:10:11,840 --> 02:10:13,669
haven't proven this so this is so now
this is me guessing where the theory is

7766
02:10:13,669 --> 02:10:13,679
this is me guessing where the theory is
 

7767
02:10:13,679 --> 02:10:14,390
this is me guessing where the theory is
going to go

7768
02:10:14,390 --> 02:10:14,400
going to go
 

7769
02:10:14,400 --> 02:10:16,069
going to go
not i haven't done this there's no paper

7770
02:10:16,069 --> 02:10:16,079
not i haven't done this there's no paper
 

7771
02:10:16,079 --> 02:10:18,470
not i haven't done this there's no paper
on this yet so now i'm speculating my

7772
02:10:18,470 --> 02:10:18,480
on this yet so now i'm speculating my
 

7773
02:10:18,480 --> 02:10:20,629
on this yet so now i'm speculating my
guess is i'll be able to show or the or

7774
02:10:20,629 --> 02:10:20,639
guess is i'll be able to show or the or
 

7775
02:10:20,639 --> 02:10:22,149
guess is i'll be able to show or the or
the my brighter colleagues working with

7776
02:10:22,149 --> 02:10:22,159
the my brighter colleagues working with
 

7777
02:10:22,159 --> 02:10:23,589
the my brighter colleagues working with
me will be able to show

7778
02:10:23,589 --> 02:10:23,599
me will be able to show
 

7779
02:10:23,599 --> 02:10:25,669
me will be able to show
that that we will get evolution of

7780
02:10:25,669 --> 02:10:25,679
that that we will get evolution of
 

7781
02:10:25,679 --> 02:10:27,030
that that we will get evolution of
natural selection the notion of

objects and so forth coming out as a
 

7787
02:10:30,320 --> 02:10:32,310
objects and so forth coming out as a
projection of this thing and and that

7788
02:10:32,310 --> 02:10:32,320
projection of this thing and and that
 

7789
02:10:32,320 --> 02:10:33,510
projection of this thing and and that
the self

the self
 

7791
02:10:33,520 --> 02:10:35,750
the self
this then will be be really interesting

7792
02:10:35,750 --> 02:10:35,760
this then will be be really interesting
 

7793
02:10:35,760 --> 02:10:37,350
this then will be be really interesting
in terms of how it starts to interact

02:10:37,350 --> 02:10:37,360
in terms of how it starts to interact

02:10:38,960 --> 02:10:41,669
with certain
um spiritual traditions right where they

7798
02:10:41,669 --> 02:10:41,679
um spiritual traditions right where they
 

7799
02:10:41,679 --> 02:10:43,990
um spiritual traditions right where they
will say that there is a notion of self

7800
02:10:43,990 --> 02:10:44,000
will say that there is a notion of self
 

7801
02:10:44,000 --> 02:10:46,069
will say that there is a notion of self
that needs to be let go which is this

7802
02:10:46,069 --> 02:10:46,079
that needs to be let go which is this
 

7803
02:10:46,079 --> 02:10:47,750
that needs to be let go which is this

deep capital self but our little
 

7827
02:11:16,079 --> 02:11:18,709
deep capital self but our little
capital lowercase s selves could be

7828
02:11:18,709 --> 02:11:18,719
capital lowercase s selves could be
 

7829
02:11:18,719 --> 02:11:20,709
capital lowercase s selves could be
artifacts of projection

7830
02:11:20,709 --> 02:11:20,719
artifacts of projection
 

7831
02:11:20,719 --> 02:11:22,149
artifacts of projection
and

7832
02:11:22,149 --> 02:11:22,159
and
 

7833
02:11:22,159 --> 02:11:24,470
and
it may be that

7834
02:11:24,470 --> 02:11:24,480
it may be that
 

7835
02:11:24,480 --> 02:11:25,750
it may be that
what consciousness is doing in this

7836
02:11:25,750 --> 02:11:25,760
what consciousness is doing in this
 

7837
02:11:25,760 --> 02:11:27,510
what consciousness is doing in this
framework is right it's it's projected

7838
02:11:27,510 --> 02:11:27,520
framework is right it's it's projected
 

7839
02:11:27,520 --> 02:11:28,950
framework is right it's it's projected
itself down

7840
02:11:28,950 --> 02:11:28,960
itself down
 

7841
02:11:28,960 --> 02:11:31,990
itself down
into a self that calls itself dawn and a

7842
02:11:31,990 --> 02:11:32,000
into a self that calls itself dawn and a
 

7843
02:11:32,000 --> 02:11:33,830
into a self that calls itself dawn and a
self that calls itself lacks

7844
02:11:33,830 --> 02:11:33,840
self that calls itself lacks
 

7845
02:11:33,840 --> 02:11:34,629
self that calls itself lacks
and

7846
02:11:34,629 --> 02:11:34,639
and
 

7847
02:11:34,639 --> 02:11:36,069
and
through conversations like this it's

7848
02:11:36,069 --> 02:11:36,079
through conversations like this it's
 

7849
02:11:36,079 --> 02:11:37,750
through conversations like this it's
trying to find out about itself

7850
02:11:37,750 --> 02:11:37,760
trying to find out about itself
 

7851
02:11:37,760 --> 02:11:40,390
trying to find out about itself
and eventually transcend

7852
02:11:40,390 --> 02:11:40,400
and eventually transcend
 

7853
02:11:40,400 --> 02:11:43,510
and eventually transcend
the limits of the don and lex

7854
02:11:43,510 --> 02:11:43,520
the limits of the don and lex
 

7855
02:11:43,520 --> 02:11:45,750
the limits of the don and lex
little icons that it's using

7856
02:11:45,750 --> 02:11:45,760
little icons that it's using
 

7857
02:11:45,760 --> 02:11:48,870
little icons that it's using
and and that little projection of itself

7858
02:11:48,870 --> 02:11:48,880
and and that little projection of itself
 

7859
02:11:48,880 --> 02:11:50,470
and and that little projection of itself
through this kind of conversation

7860
02:11:50,470 --> 02:11:50,480
through this kind of conversation
 

7861
02:11:50,480 --> 02:11:53,589
through this kind of conversation
somehow it it's learning about itself

7862
02:11:53,589 --> 02:11:53,599
somehow it it's learning about itself
 

7863
02:11:53,599 --> 02:11:57,589
somehow it it's learning about itself
so that that thing dressed me up today

7864
02:11:57,589 --> 02:11:57,599
so that that thing dressed me up today
 

7865
02:11:57,599 --> 02:11:59,910
so that that thing dressed me up today
in order to understand itself

7866
02:11:59,910 --> 02:11:59,920
in order to understand itself
 

7867
02:11:59,920 --> 02:12:01,750
in order to understand itself
and in some sense you and i are not

7868
02:12:01,750 --> 02:12:01,760
and in some sense you and i are not
 

7869
02:12:01,760 --> 02:12:02,870
and in some sense you and i are not
separate from that thing and we're not

7870
02:12:02,870 --> 02:12:02,880
separate from that thing and we're not
 

7871
02:12:02,880 --> 02:12:04,709
separate from that thing and we're not
separate from each other yeah

7872
02:12:04,709 --> 02:12:04,719
separate from each other yeah
 

7873
02:12:04,719 --> 02:12:06,390
separate from each other yeah
well i have to question the fashion

7874
02:12:06,390 --> 02:12:06,400
well i have to question the fashion
 

7875
02:12:06,400 --> 02:12:08,390
well i have to question the fashion
choices on my end then

7876
02:12:08,390 --> 02:12:08,400
choices on my end then
 

7877
02:12:08,400 --> 02:12:10,790
choices on my end then
all right so uh you mentioned you agree

7878
02:12:10,790 --> 02:12:10,800
all right so uh you mentioned you agree
 

7879
02:12:10,800 --> 02:12:13,750
all right so uh you mentioned you agree
on in terms of consciousness on

7880
02:12:13,750 --> 02:12:13,760
on in terms of consciousness on

major way
 

7893
02:12:27,280 --> 02:12:29,589
major way
about consciousness about these topics

7894
02:12:29,589 --> 02:12:29,599
about consciousness about these topics
 

7895
02:12:29,599 --> 02:12:33,109
about consciousness about these topics
of of reality that you return to

7896
02:12:33,109 --> 02:12:33,119
of of reality that you return to
 

7897
02:12:33,119 --> 02:12:37,589
of of reality that you return to
um often it's like uh uh

7898
02:12:37,589 --> 02:12:37,599
um often it's like uh uh

have had interesting conversations

7904
02:12:43,350 --> 02:12:43,360
have had interesting conversations
 

7905
02:12:43,360 --> 02:12:45,510
have had interesting conversations
through years that that added to the

7906
02:12:45,510 --> 02:12:45,520
through years that that added to the
 

7907
02:12:45,520 --> 02:12:47,030
through years that that added to the
complexity and the beauty of their

complexity and the beauty of their

02:12:48,950 --> 02:12:48,960
friendship is there is there somebody
 

7911
02:12:48,960 --> 02:12:50,149
friendship is there is there somebody
like that

7912
02:12:50,149 --> 02:12:50,159
like that
 

7913
02:12:50,159 --> 02:12:52,790
like that
um that over the years has been a source

7914
02:12:52,790 --> 02:12:52,800
um that over the years has been a source
 

7915
02:12:52,800 --> 02:12:54,550
um that over the years has been a source
of disagreement with you that

7916
02:12:54,550 --> 02:12:54,560
of disagreement with you that
 

7917
02:12:54,560 --> 02:12:57,189
of disagreement with you that
strengthened your ideas

7918
02:12:57,189 --> 02:12:57,199
strengthened your ideas
 

7919
02:12:57,199 --> 02:12:59,510
strengthened your ideas
my ideas have been really

7920
02:12:59,510 --> 02:12:59,520
my ideas have been really
 

7921
02:12:59,520 --> 02:13:01,189
my ideas have been really
shaped by

7922
02:13:01,189 --> 02:13:01,199
shaped by
 

7923
02:13:01,199 --> 02:13:02,550
shaped by
several things

7924
02:13:02,550 --> 02:13:02,560
several things
 

7925
02:13:02,560 --> 02:13:03,570
several things
one is um

7926
02:13:03,570 --> 02:13:03,580
one is um

the physicalist framework that

7930
02:13:07,669 --> 02:13:07,679
the physicalist framework that
 

7931
02:13:07,679 --> 02:13:09,270
the physicalist framework that
my scientific colleagues almost to a

7932
02:13:09,270 --> 02:13:09,280
my scientific colleagues almost to a
 

7933
02:13:09,280 --> 02:13:10,229
my scientific colleagues almost to a
person

7934
02:13:10,229 --> 02:13:10,239
person
 

7935
02:13:10,239 --> 02:13:12,709
person
have adopted and that i adopted to

7936
02:13:12,709 --> 02:13:12,719
have adopted and that i adopted to
 

7937
02:13:12,719 --> 02:13:14,790
have adopted and that i adopted to
until i the reason i walked away from it

7938
02:13:14,790 --> 02:13:14,800
until i the reason i walked away from it
 

7939
02:13:14,800 --> 02:13:18,229
until i the reason i walked away from it
was because i uh it became

7940
02:13:18,229 --> 02:13:18,239
was because i uh it became
 

7941
02:13:18,239 --> 02:13:19,589
was because i uh it became
clear that

7942
02:13:19,589 --> 02:13:19,599
clear that
 

7943
02:13:19,599 --> 02:13:20,950
clear that
we couldn't start with unconscious

7944
02:13:20,950 --> 02:13:20,960
we couldn't start with unconscious
 

7945
02:13:20,960 --> 02:13:22,709
we couldn't start with unconscious
ingredients and boot up consciousness

7946
02:13:22,709 --> 02:13:22,719
ingredients and boot up consciousness
 

7947
02:13:22,719 --> 02:13:25,910
ingredients and boot up consciousness
can you define physicalists

7948
02:13:25,910 --> 02:13:25,920
can you define physicalists
 

7949
02:13:25,920 --> 02:13:28,870
can you define physicalists
in contrast to reductionist

7950
02:13:28,870 --> 02:13:28,880
in contrast to reductionist
 

7951
02:13:28,880 --> 02:13:32,310
in contrast to reductionist
so a physicalist i i would

7952
02:13:32,310 --> 02:13:32,320
so a physicalist i i would
 

7953
02:13:32,320 --> 02:13:34,470
so a physicalist i i would
say is someone who takes space time and

7954
02:13:34,470 --> 02:13:34,480
say is someone who takes space time and
 

7955
02:13:34,480 --> 02:13:36,950
say is someone who takes space time and
the objects within space time as

7956
02:13:36,950 --> 02:13:36,960
the objects within space time as
 

7957
02:13:36,960 --> 02:13:38,790
the objects within space time as
ontologically fundamental

7958
02:13:38,790 --> 02:13:38,800
ontologically fundamental
 

7959
02:13:38,800 --> 02:13:41,430
ontologically fundamental
right and then reductionist is

7960
02:13:41,430 --> 02:13:41,440
right and then reductionist is
 

7961
02:13:41,440 --> 02:13:43,510
right and then reductionist is
saying the smaller the more fundamental

7962
02:13:43,510 --> 02:13:43,520
saying the smaller the more fundamental
 

7963
02:13:43,520 --> 02:13:45,430
saying the smaller the more fundamental
that's a methodological

7964
02:13:45,430 --> 02:13:45,440
that's a methodological
 

7965
02:13:45,440 --> 02:13:47,189
that's a methodological
thing that's that's saying within

7966
02:13:47,189 --> 02:13:47,199
thing that's that's saying within
 

7967
02:13:47,199 --> 02:13:48,790
thing that's that's saying within
space-time as you go to smaller and

7968
02:13:48,790 --> 02:13:48,800
space-time as you go to smaller and
 

7969
02:13:48,800 --> 02:13:51,109
space-time as you go to smaller and
smaller scales in space you get deeper

7970
02:13:51,109 --> 02:13:51,119
smaller scales in space you get deeper
 

7971
02:13:51,119 --> 02:13:52,470
smaller scales in space you get deeper
and deeper laws more and more

7972
02:13:52,470 --> 02:13:52,480
and deeper laws more and more
 

7973
02:13:52,480 --> 02:13:54,229
and deeper laws more and more
fundamental laws

7974
02:13:54,229 --> 02:13:54,239
fundamental laws
 

7975
02:13:54,239 --> 02:13:56,629
fundamental laws
and you know the reduction of

7976
02:13:56,629 --> 02:13:56,639
and you know the reduction of
 

7977
02:13:56,639 --> 02:13:59,109
and you know the reduction of
temperature to

7978
02:13:59,109 --> 02:13:59,119
temperature to
 

7979
02:13:59,119 --> 02:14:01,109
temperature to
particle movement was an example of that

7980
02:14:01,109 --> 02:14:01,119
particle movement was an example of that
 

7981
02:14:01,119 --> 02:14:03,030
particle movement was an example of that
but i think that that that

7982
02:14:03,030 --> 02:14:03,040
but i think that that that
 

7983
02:14:03,040 --> 02:14:04,950
but i think that that that
the reason that worked was

the reason that worked was
 

7985
02:14:04,960 --> 02:14:06,629
the reason that worked was
almost an artifact of the nature of our

7993
02:14:11,280 --> 02:14:13,589
colleagues including yourself or
physicalist and now you broke away broke

7994
02:14:13,589 --> 02:14:13,599
physicalist and now you broke away broke
 

7995
02:14:13,599 --> 02:14:15,510
physicalist and now you broke away broke
away because i think you can't start

7996
02:14:15,510 --> 02:14:15,520
away because i think you can't start
 

7997
02:14:15,520 --> 02:14:17,189
away because i think you can't start
with unconscious ingredients and boot up

7998
02:14:17,189 --> 02:14:17,199
with unconscious ingredients and boot up
 

7999
02:14:17,199 --> 02:14:18,310
with unconscious ingredients and boot up
consciousness

8000
02:14:18,310 --> 02:14:18,320
consciousness
 

8001
02:14:18,320 --> 02:14:19,430
consciousness
and

8002
02:14:19,430 --> 02:14:19,440
and
 

8003
02:14:19,440 --> 02:14:21,669
and
so even with roger penrose where there's

8004
02:14:21,669 --> 02:14:21,679
so even with roger penrose where there's
 

8005
02:14:21,679 --> 02:14:23,830
so even with roger penrose where there's
like a gray area

8006
02:14:23,830 --> 02:14:23,840
like a gray area
 

8007
02:14:23,840 --> 02:14:26,149
like a gray area
right and here's the the challenge i

8008
02:14:26,149 --> 02:14:26,159
right and here's the the challenge i
 

8009
02:14:26,159 --> 02:14:28,149
right and here's the the challenge i
would put to to all of

8010
02:14:28,149 --> 02:14:28,159
would put to to all of
 

8011
02:14:28,159 --> 02:14:31,669
would put to to all of
my friends um and colleagues who are

8012
02:14:31,669 --> 02:14:31,679
my friends um and colleagues who are
 

8013
02:14:31,679 --> 02:14:35,830
my friends um and colleagues who are
give one specific conscious experience

8014
02:14:35,830 --> 02:14:35,840

 

8015
02:14:35,840 --> 02:14:37,270

that you can boot up

8016
02:14:37,270 --> 02:14:37,280
that you can boot up
 

8017
02:14:37,280 --> 02:14:38,950
that you can boot up
right so if you think that it's

8018
02:14:38,950 --> 02:14:38,960
right so if you think that it's
 

8019
02:14:38,960 --> 02:14:40,470
right so if you think that it's
integrated information

8020
02:14:40,470 --> 02:14:40,480
integrated information
 

8021
02:14:40,480 --> 02:14:41,990
integrated information
and this i've asked this

8022
02:14:41,990 --> 02:14:42,000
and this i've asked this
 

8023
02:14:42,000 --> 02:14:44,149
and this i've asked this
of julia to know me a couple times back

8024
02:14:44,149 --> 02:14:44,159
of julia to know me a couple times back
 

8025
02:14:44,159 --> 02:14:45,669
of julia to know me a couple times back
in the 90s and then just a couple years

8026
02:14:45,669 --> 02:14:45,679
in the 90s and then just a couple years
 

8027
02:14:45,679 --> 02:14:48,229
in the 90s and then just a couple years
ago i asked julio okay so great and

8028
02:14:48,229 --> 02:14:48,239
ago i asked julio okay so great and
 

8029
02:14:48,239 --> 02:14:49,750
ago i asked julio okay so great and
great information so

8030
02:14:49,750 --> 02:14:49,760
great information so
 

8031
02:14:49,760 --> 02:14:51,669
great information so
we're all interested in explaining some

8032
02:14:51,669 --> 02:14:51,679
we're all interested in explaining some

doesn't mean they're wrong just because

8072
02:15:28,550 --> 02:15:28,560
doesn't mean they're wrong just because
 

8073
02:15:28,560 --> 02:15:31,109
doesn't mean they're wrong just because
they can't find a way to boot it up yet

they can't find a way to boot it up yet
 

8075
02:15:31,119 --> 02:15:32,229
they can't find a way to boot it up yet
that's right no that doesn't mean that

8076
02:15:32,229 --> 02:15:32,239
that's right no that doesn't mean that
 

8077
02:15:32,239 --> 02:15:35,109
that's right no that doesn't mean that
they're wrong it just just means that um

8078
02:15:35,109 --> 02:15:35,119
they're wrong it just just means that um
 

8079
02:15:35,119 --> 02:15:36,629
they're wrong it just just means that um
they haven't

02:16:51,990 --> 02:16:52,000
opposite of your book title so
 

8157
02:16:52,000 --> 02:16:53,669
opposite of your book title so
um or maybe just sticking to

8158
02:16:53,669 --> 02:16:53,679
um or maybe just sticking to
 

8159
02:16:53,679 --> 02:16:54,870
um or maybe just sticking to
consciousness can you take the

8160
02:16:54,870 --> 02:16:54,880
consciousness can you take the
 

8161
02:16:54,880 --> 02:16:56,950
consciousness can you take the
physicalist view

8162
02:16:56,950 --> 02:16:56,960
physicalist view
 

8163
02:16:56,960 --> 02:16:58,709
physicalist view
can you steal man the physicalist view

8164
02:16:58,709 --> 02:16:58,719
can you steal man the physicalist view
 

8165
02:16:58,719 --> 02:17:00,549
can you steal man the physicalist view
for a brief moment playing devil's

8166
02:17:00,549 --> 02:17:00,559
for a brief moment playing devil's
 

8167
02:17:00,559 --> 02:17:04,070
for a brief moment playing devil's
advocate to or um steel man the person

8168
02:17:04,070 --> 02:17:04,080
advocate to or um steel man the person
 

8169
02:17:04,080 --> 02:17:05,509
advocate to or um steel man the person
you used to be

8170
02:17:05,509 --> 02:17:05,519
you used to be
 

8171
02:17:05,519 --> 02:17:07,270
you used to be
right the physicalist

8172
02:17:07,270 --> 02:17:07,280
right the physicalist
 

8173
02:17:07,280 --> 02:17:08,629
right the physicalist
what's the good

8174
02:17:08,629 --> 02:17:08,639
what's the good
 

8175
02:17:08,639 --> 02:17:10,469
what's the good
like saying that you might be wrong

8176
02:17:10,469 --> 02:17:10,479
like saying that you might be wrong
 

8177
02:17:10,479 --> 02:17:12,469
like saying that you might be wrong
right now

8178
02:17:12,469 --> 02:17:12,479
right now
 

8179
02:17:12,479 --> 02:17:15,270
right now
what would be a convincing

8180
02:17:15,270 --> 02:17:15,280
what would be a convincing
 

8181
02:17:15,280 --> 02:17:17,190
what would be a convincing
argument for that

8182
02:17:17,190 --> 02:17:17,200
argument for that
 

8183
02:17:17,200 --> 02:17:19,589
argument for that
well i think the

8184
02:17:19,589 --> 02:17:19,599
well i think the
 

8185
02:17:19,599 --> 02:17:20,309
well i think the
the

8186
02:17:20,309 --> 02:17:20,319
the
 

8187
02:17:20,319 --> 02:17:21,910
the
argument i would give and that i

8188
02:17:21,910 --> 02:17:21,920
argument i would give and that i
 

8189
02:17:21,920 --> 02:17:24,230
argument i would give and that i
believed was look when you have very

8190
02:17:24,230 --> 02:17:24,240
believed was look when you have very
 

8191
02:17:24,240 --> 02:17:26,629
believed was look when you have very
simple physical systems like

8192
02:17:26,629 --> 02:17:26,639
simple physical systems like
 

8193
02:17:26,639 --> 02:17:28,709
simple physical systems like
a piece of dirt there's not much

a piece of dirt there's not much
evidence of life for consciousness it's

8196
02:17:30,549 --> 02:17:30,559
evidence of life for consciousness it's
 

8197
02:17:30,559 --> 02:17:31,910
evidence of life for consciousness it's
only when you get really complicated

8198
02:17:31,910 --> 02:17:31,920
only when you get really complicated
 

8199
02:17:31,920 --> 02:17:34,389
only when you get really complicated
physical systems like that have brains

8200
02:17:34,389 --> 02:17:34,399
physical systems like that have brains
 

8201
02:17:34,399 --> 02:17:35,910
physical systems like that have brains
and really the more complicated the

8202
02:17:35,910 --> 02:17:35,920
and really the more complicated the
 

8203
02:17:35,920 --> 02:17:38,150
and really the more complicated the
brains the more it looks like

8204
02:17:38,150 --> 02:17:38,160
brains the more it looks like
 

8205
02:17:38,160 --> 02:17:39,429
brains the more it looks like
there's consciousness and the more

8206
02:17:39,429 --> 02:17:39,439
there's consciousness and the more
 

8207
02:17:39,439 --> 02:17:41,270
there's consciousness and the more
complicated that consciousness is

8208
02:17:41,270 --> 02:17:41,280
complicated that consciousness is
 

8209
02:17:41,280 --> 02:17:43,190
complicated that consciousness is
surely that means

8210
02:17:43,190 --> 02:17:43,200
surely that means
 

8211
02:17:43,200 --> 02:17:45,349
surely that means
that simple physical systems don't

8212
02:17:45,349 --> 02:17:45,359
that simple physical systems don't
 

8213
02:17:45,359 --> 02:17:46,469
that simple physical systems don't
create

elementary kinds of simple conscious
experiences but you need

02:17:55,190 --> 02:17:55,200
experiences but you need
 

8225
02:17:55,200 --> 02:17:57,589
experiences but you need
more complicated physical systems

8226
02:17:57,589 --> 02:17:57,599
more complicated physical systems
 

8227
02:17:57,599 --> 02:17:59,270
more complicated physical systems
to boot up

02:17:59,270 --> 02:17:59,280
to boot up
 

8229
02:17:59,280 --> 02:18:01,190
to boot up
to create more complicated

to create more complicated
consciousnesses i think that's the

8232
02:18:02,469 --> 02:18:02,479
consciousnesses i think that's the
 

8233
02:18:02,479 --> 02:18:03,910
consciousnesses i think that's the
intuition that drives most of my

8234
02:18:03,910 --> 02:18:03,920
intuition that drives most of my
 

8235
02:18:03,920 --> 02:18:06,629
intuition that drives most of my
colleagues and you're saying that this

8236
02:18:06,629 --> 02:18:06,639
colleagues and you're saying that this
 

8237
02:18:06,639 --> 02:18:08,950
colleagues and you're saying that this
concept of complexity

8238
02:18:08,950 --> 02:18:08,960
concept of complexity
 

8239
02:18:08,960 --> 02:18:11,030
concept of complexity
is ill-defined

8240
02:18:11,030 --> 02:18:11,040
is ill-defined
 

8241
02:18:11,040 --> 02:18:13,509
is ill-defined
when you ground it to space-time

8242
02:18:13,509 --> 02:18:13,519
when you ground it to space-time
 

8243
02:18:13,519 --> 02:18:15,589
when you ground it to space-time
well well i think it's well-defined

8244
02:18:15,589 --> 02:18:15,599
well well i think it's well-defined
 

8245
02:18:15,599 --> 02:18:17,349
well well i think it's well-defined
within the framework of space-time right

8246
02:18:17,349 --> 02:18:17,359
within the framework of space-time right
 

8247
02:18:17,359 --> 02:18:18,709
within the framework of space-time right
no it's

8248
02:18:18,709 --> 02:18:18,719
no it's
 

8249
02:18:18,719 --> 02:18:21,270
no it's
ill-defined relative to what you need to

8250
02:18:21,270 --> 02:18:21,280
ill-defined relative to what you need to
 

8251
02:18:21,280 --> 02:18:23,110
ill-defined relative to what you need to
actually understand consciousness

8252
02:18:23,110 --> 02:18:23,120
actually understand consciousness
 

8253
02:18:23,120 --> 02:18:25,110
actually understand consciousness
because you're grounding complexity in

8254
02:18:25,110 --> 02:18:25,120
because you're grounding complexity in
 

8255
02:18:25,120 --> 02:18:26,950
because you're grounding complexity in
just in space-time well got you right

8256
02:18:26,950 --> 02:18:26,960
just in space-time well got you right
 

8257
02:18:26,960 --> 02:18:31,429
just in space-time well got you right
right yeah yeah what i'm saying is

8258
02:18:31,429 --> 02:18:31,439
right yeah yeah what i'm saying is
 

8259
02:18:31,439 --> 02:18:33,429
right yeah yeah what i'm saying is
if it were true

8260
02:18:33,429 --> 02:18:33,439
if it were true
 

8261
02:18:33,439 --> 02:18:36,790
if it were true
that space-time was fundamental

8262
02:18:36,790 --> 02:18:36,800
that space-time was fundamental
 

8263
02:18:36,800 --> 02:18:38,389
that space-time was fundamental
then i would have to agree that if there

8264
02:18:38,389 --> 02:18:38,399
then i would have to agree that if there
 

8265
02:18:38,399 --> 02:18:40,070
then i would have to agree that if there
is such a thing as consciousness

8266
02:18:40,070 --> 02:18:40,080
is such a thing as consciousness
 

8267
02:18:40,080 --> 02:18:41,589
is such a thing as consciousness
given the data that we've got that you

8268
02:18:41,589 --> 02:18:41,599
given the data that we've got that you
 

8269
02:18:41,599 --> 02:18:42,389
given the data that we've got that you
know

8270
02:18:42,389 --> 02:18:42,399
know
 

8271
02:18:42,399 --> 02:18:44,070
know
complex brains have consciousness and

8272
02:18:44,070 --> 02:18:44,080
complex brains have consciousness and
 

8273
02:18:44,080 --> 02:18:45,750
complex brains have consciousness and
you know dirt doesn't

8274
02:18:45,750 --> 02:18:45,760
you know dirt doesn't
 

8275
02:18:45,760 --> 02:18:47,830
you know dirt doesn't
that somehow is the complexity of the

8276
02:18:47,830 --> 02:18:47,840
that somehow is the complexity of the
 

8277
02:18:47,840 --> 02:18:50,389
that somehow is the complexity of the
dynamics or organization

8278
02:18:50,389 --> 02:18:50,399
dynamics or organization
 

8279
02:18:50,399 --> 02:18:52,070
dynamics or organization
the function of the physical system that

8280
02:18:52,070 --> 02:18:52,080
the function of the physical system that
 

8281
02:18:52,080 --> 02:18:54,150
the function of the physical system that
somehow is creating the consciousness

8282
02:18:54,150 --> 02:18:54,160
somehow is creating the consciousness
 

8283
02:18:54,160 --> 02:18:55,030
somehow is creating the consciousness
um

8284
02:18:55,030 --> 02:18:55,040
um
 

8285
02:18:55,040 --> 02:18:55,830
um
so

8286
02:18:55,830 --> 02:18:55,840
so
 

8287
02:18:55,840 --> 02:18:57,349
so
under those assumptions

8288
02:18:57,349 --> 02:18:57,359
under those assumptions
 

8289
02:18:57,359 --> 02:18:59,429
under those assumptions
yes but when the physicists themselves

8290
02:18:59,429 --> 02:18:59,439
yes but when the physicists themselves
 

8291
02:18:59,439 --> 02:19:00,709
yes but when the physicists themselves
are telling us that space time is not

8292
02:19:00,709 --> 02:19:00,719
are telling us that space time is not
 

8293
02:19:00,719 --> 02:19:02,469
are telling us that space time is not
fundamental

8294
02:19:02,469 --> 02:19:02,479
fundamental
 

8295
02:19:02,479 --> 02:19:04,230
fundamental
then i can understand see then the whole

8296
02:19:04,230 --> 02:19:04,240
then i can understand see then the whole
 

8297
02:19:04,240 --> 02:19:06,950
then i can understand see then the whole
picture starts to come into focus

8298
02:19:06,950 --> 02:19:06,960
picture starts to come into focus
 

8299
02:19:06,960 --> 02:19:09,429
picture starts to come into focus
why my colleagues are brilliant

why my colleagues are brilliant
 

8301
02:19:09,439 --> 02:19:10,790
why my colleagues are brilliant

we've not been able to do that and so

8379
02:20:24,080 --> 02:20:26,389
bit he calls it the last dollop um and
just say stipulate it as a bare fact of

02:20:26,389 --> 02:20:26,399
just say stipulate it as a bare fact of
 

8381

just say stipulate it as a bare fact of

well
from my point of view as the physical

8386
02:20:30,389 --> 02:20:30,399
from my point of view as the physical

02:20:32,160 --> 02:20:33,750
the whole point the whole promise of the

stipulate i was going to start with the

8392
02:20:35,510 --> 02:20:35,520
stipulate i was going to start with the
 

8393
02:20:35,520 --> 02:20:37,349
stipulate i was going to start with the
physical stuff and explain where the

8394
02:20:37,349 --> 02:20:37,359
physical stuff and explain where the
 

8395
02:20:37,359 --> 02:20:39,429
physical stuff and explain where the
consciousness came from if i'm going to

8396
02:20:39,429 --> 02:20:39,439
consciousness came from if i'm going to
 

8397
02:20:39,439 --> 02:20:41,190
consciousness came from if i'm going to
stipulate consciousness why don't i just

8398
02:20:41,190 --> 02:20:41,200
stipulate consciousness why don't i just
 

8399
02:20:41,200 --> 02:20:42,870
stipulate consciousness why don't i just
stipulate consciousness and not

8400
02:20:42,870 --> 02:20:42,880
stipulate consciousness and not
 

8401
02:20:42,880 --> 02:20:45,030
stipulate consciousness and not
stipulate all the physical stuff too so

8402
02:20:45,030 --> 02:20:45,040
stipulate all the physical stuff too so
 

8403
02:20:45,040 --> 02:20:47,830
stipulate all the physical stuff too so
i'm stipulating less i'm saying okay i

8404
02:20:47,830 --> 02:20:47,840
i'm stipulating less i'm saying okay i
 

8405
02:20:47,840 --> 02:20:48,870
i'm stipulating less i'm saying okay i
agree

8406
02:20:48,870 --> 02:20:48,880
agree
 

8407
02:20:48,880 --> 02:20:50,710
agree
perspective well it's it's actually what

8408
02:20:50,710 --> 02:20:50,720
perspective well it's it's actually what
 

8409
02:20:50,720 --> 02:20:52,469
perspective well it's it's actually what
i call the conscious realist perspective

8410
02:20:52,469 --> 02:20:52,479
i call the conscious realist perspective
 

8411
02:20:52,479 --> 02:20:53,670
i call the conscious realist perspective

pan cyclists are effectively duelists
 

8415
02:20:55,520 --> 02:20:56,790
pan cyclists are effectively duelists
right they're saying there's physical

8416
02:20:56,790 --> 02:20:56,800
right they're saying there's physical
 

8417
02:20:56,800 --> 02:20:58,389
right they're saying there's physical
stuff that really is fundamental

8418
02:20:58,389 --> 02:20:58,399
stuff that really is fundamental
 

8419
02:20:58,399 --> 02:21:00,309
stuff that really is fundamental
and then consciousness stuff so i would

8420
02:21:00,309 --> 02:21:00,319
and then consciousness stuff so i would
 

8421
02:21:00,319 --> 02:21:02,070
and then consciousness stuff so i would
go with pinker and say look let's just

8422
02:21:02,070 --> 02:21:02,080
go with pinker and say look let's just
 

8423
02:21:02,080 --> 02:21:04,070
go with pinker and say look let's just
stipulate the consciousness stuff but

8424
02:21:04,070 --> 02:21:04,080
stipulate the consciousness stuff but
 

8425
02:21:04,080 --> 02:21:05,429
stipulate the consciousness stuff but
i'm not going to stipulate the physical

8426
02:21:05,429 --> 02:21:05,439
i'm not going to stipulate the physical
 

8427
02:21:05,439 --> 02:21:07,270
i'm not going to stipulate the physical
stuff i'm going to actually now show how

8428
02:21:07,270 --> 02:21:07,280
stuff i'm going to actually now show how
 

8429
02:21:07,280 --> 02:21:09,429
stuff i'm going to actually now show how
to boot up the physical stuff from just

8430
02:21:09,429 --> 02:21:09,439
to boot up the physical stuff from just
 

8431
02:21:09,439 --> 02:21:10,950
to boot up the physical stuff from just
the consciousness stuff

8432
02:21:10,950 --> 02:21:10,960
the consciousness stuff
 

8433
02:21:10,960 --> 02:21:13,590
the consciousness stuff
so i'll stipulate less is it possible so

8434
02:21:13,590 --> 02:21:13,600
so i'll stipulate less is it possible so
 

8435
02:21:13,600 --> 02:21:16,630
so i'll stipulate less is it possible so
if you stipulate less is it possible for

8436
02:21:16,630 --> 02:21:16,640
if you stipulate less is it possible for
 

8437
02:21:16,640 --> 02:21:21,990
if you stipulate less is it possible for
our limited brains to visualize reality

8438
02:21:21,990 --> 02:21:22,000

02:21:23,280 --> 02:21:25,510
as we
delve deeper and deeper and deeper

8442
02:21:25,510 --> 02:21:25,520
delve deeper and deeper and deeper
 

8443
02:21:25,520 --> 02:21:28,070

sorry well two we really are looking
through a two-dimensional screen until

02:22:08,950 --> 02:22:08,960
through a two-dimensional screen until
 

8481
02:22:08,960 --> 02:22:11,590
through a two-dimensional screen until

making it 4d anyway is it possible to

8488
02:22:18,870 --> 02:22:18,880
making it 4d anyway is it possible to
 

8489
02:22:18,880 --> 02:22:20,870
making it 4d anyway is it possible to
visualize some pretty pictures that give

02:22:20,870 --> 02:22:20,880
visualize some pretty pictures that give
 

8491
02:22:20,880 --> 02:22:24,150
visualize some pretty pictures that give
us a deeper sense of the truth of

02:22:24,150 --> 02:22:24,160
us a deeper sense of the truth of
 

8493
02:22:24,160 --> 02:22:25,670
us a deeper sense of the truth of

8495
02:22:25,680 --> 02:22:27,270

i think that we will

8496
02:22:27,270 --> 02:22:27,280
i think that we will
 

8497
02:22:27,280 --> 02:22:29,510
i think that we will
incrementally be able to do that

8498
02:22:29,510 --> 02:22:29,520
incrementally be able to do that
 

8499
02:22:29,520 --> 02:22:32,630
incrementally be able to do that
i think that for example

8500
02:22:32,630 --> 02:22:32,640
i think that for example
 

8501
02:22:32,640 --> 02:22:34,630
i think that for example
the picture that we have of

8502
02:22:34,630 --> 02:22:34,640
the picture that we have of
 

8503
02:22:34,640 --> 02:22:37,349
the picture that we have of
electrons and photons interacting

8504
02:22:37,349 --> 02:22:37,359
electrons and photons interacting
 

8505
02:22:37,359 --> 02:22:40,150

02:22:41,600 --> 02:22:43,670
wasn't
it may have not been possible until

8510
02:22:43,670 --> 02:22:43,680
it may have not been possible until
 

8511
02:22:43,680 --> 02:22:45,190
it may have not been possible until
faraday did all of his experiments and

8512
02:22:45,190 --> 02:22:45,200
faraday did all of his experiments and
 

8513
02:22:45,200 --> 02:22:47,110
faraday did all of his experiments and
then maxwell wrote down his equations

8514
02:22:47,110 --> 02:22:47,120
then maxwell wrote down his equations
 

8515
02:22:47,120 --> 02:22:49,270
then maxwell wrote down his equations
and and we were then sort of forced by

8516
02:22:49,270 --> 02:22:49,280
and and we were then sort of forced by
 

8517
02:22:49,280 --> 02:22:52,790
and and we were then sort of forced by
his equations to think in a new way

8518
02:22:52,790 --> 02:22:52,800
his equations to think in a new way
 

8519
02:22:52,800 --> 02:22:56,070
his equations to think in a new way
and then then when planck in 1900

8520
02:22:56,070 --> 02:22:56,080
and then then when planck in 1900
 

8521
02:22:56,080 --> 02:22:56,870
and then then when planck in 1900

and he in desperation
 

8539
02:23:13,359 --> 02:23:15,270
and he in desperation
proposed

02:23:15,270 --> 02:23:15,280
proposed

8542
02:23:20,550 --> 02:23:20,560

 

8543
02:23:20,560 --> 02:23:22,950

then once once you've done that

8544
02:23:22,950 --> 02:23:22,960
then once once you've done that
 

8545
02:23:22,960 --> 02:23:24,389
then once once you've done that
and then you have an einstein come along

8546
02:23:24,389 --> 02:23:24,399
and then you have an einstein come along
 

8547
02:23:24,399 --> 02:23:25,990
and then you have an einstein come along
five years later and show how that

8548
02:23:25,990 --> 02:23:26,000
five years later and show how that
 

8549
02:23:26,000 --> 02:23:27,750
five years later and show how that
explains the photoelectro

8550
02:23:27,750 --> 02:23:27,760
explains the photoelectro
 

8551
02:23:27,760 --> 02:23:30,630
explains the photoelectro
photoelectric effect and then

8552
02:23:30,630 --> 02:23:30,640
photoelectric effect and then
 

8553
02:23:30,640 --> 02:23:33,190
photoelectric effect and then
then eventually in 1926 you get quantum

8554
02:23:33,190 --> 02:23:33,200
then eventually in 1926 you get quantum
 

8555
02:23:33,200 --> 02:23:34,630
then eventually in 1926 you get quantum
theory and then you get this whole new

8556
02:23:34,630 --> 02:23:34,640
theory and then you get this whole new
 

8557
02:23:34,640 --> 02:23:36,469
theory and then you get this whole new
way of thinking that was

8558
02:23:36,469 --> 02:23:36,479
way of thinking that was
 

8559
02:23:36,479 --> 02:23:37,830
way of thinking that was
you know from the newtonian point of

8560
02:23:37,830 --> 02:23:37,840
you know from the newtonian point of
 

8561
02:23:37,840 --> 02:23:40,230
you know from the newtonian point of
view completely

8562
02:23:40,230 --> 02:23:40,240
view completely
 

8563
02:23:40,240 --> 02:23:42,150
view completely
contradictory and and were

8564
02:23:42,150 --> 02:23:42,160
contradictory and and were
 

8565
02:23:42,160 --> 02:23:44,389
contradictory and and were
counter-intuitive certainly

8566
02:23:44,389 --> 02:23:44,399
counter-intuitive certainly
 

8567
02:23:44,399 --> 02:23:45,270
counter-intuitive certainly
yeah

8568
02:23:45,270 --> 02:23:45,280
yeah
 

8569
02:23:45,280 --> 02:23:47,030
yeah
and maybe if jesus is right not

8570
02:23:47,030 --> 02:23:47,040
and maybe if jesus is right not
 

8571
02:23:47,040 --> 02:23:49,030
and maybe if jesus is right not
contradictory maybe if you use

8572
02:23:49,030 --> 02:23:49,040
contradictory maybe if you use
 

8573
02:23:49,040 --> 02:23:49,990
contradictory maybe if you use
intuitionist math they're not

8574
02:23:49,990 --> 02:23:50,000
intuitionist math they're not
 

8575
02:23:50,000 --> 02:23:52,309
intuitionist math they're not
contradictory but still

8576
02:23:52,309 --> 02:23:52,319
contradictory but still
 

8577
02:23:52,319 --> 02:23:54,230
contradictory but still
certainly you wouldn't have gone there

8578
02:23:54,230 --> 02:23:54,240
certainly you wouldn't have gone there
 

8579
02:23:54,240 --> 02:23:56,070
certainly you wouldn't have gone there
and so here's a case where the

8580
02:23:56,070 --> 02:23:56,080
and so here's a case where the
 

8581
02:23:56,080 --> 02:23:57,590
and so here's a case where the
experiments

8582
02:23:57,590 --> 02:23:57,600
experiments
 

8583
02:23:57,600 --> 02:24:01,830
experiments
and then a desperate mathematical move

8584
02:24:01,830 --> 02:24:01,840
and then a desperate mathematical move
 

8585
02:24:01,840 --> 02:24:03,349
and then a desperate mathematical move
sort of we

8586
02:24:03,349 --> 02:24:03,359
sort of we
 

8587
02:24:03,359 --> 02:24:05,270
sort of we
use those as a flashlight into the deep

8588
02:24:05,270 --> 02:24:05,280
use those as a flashlight into the deep
 

8589
02:24:05,280 --> 02:24:06,309
use those as a flashlight into the deep
fog

8590
02:24:06,309 --> 02:24:06,319
fog
 

8591
02:24:06,319 --> 02:24:08,630
fog
right where and and so that science may

8592
02:24:08,630 --> 02:24:08,640
right where and and so that science may
 

8593
02:24:08,640 --> 02:24:09,910
right where and and so that science may
be

8594
02:24:09,910 --> 02:24:09,920
be
 

8595
02:24:09,920 --> 02:24:11,110
be
um

8596
02:24:11,110 --> 02:24:11,120
um
 

8597
02:24:11,120 --> 02:24:13,590
um
the flashlight into the deep fog

8598
02:24:13,590 --> 02:24:13,600
the flashlight into the deep fog
 

8599
02:24:13,600 --> 02:24:15,270
the flashlight into the deep fog
yeah i wonder if it's still possible to

8600
02:24:15,270 --> 02:24:15,280
yeah i wonder if it's still possible to
 

8601
02:24:15,280 --> 02:24:18,070
yeah i wonder if it's still possible to
visualize in the in the deli like uh we

8602
02:24:18,070 --> 02:24:18,080
visualize in the in the deli like uh we
 

8603
02:24:18,080 --> 02:24:19,990
visualize in the in the deli like uh we
talk about consciousness in

8604
02:24:19,990 --> 02:24:20,000
talk about consciousness in
 

8605
02:24:20,000 --> 02:24:23,590
talk about consciousness in
from a self perspective experience that

8606
02:24:23,590 --> 02:24:23,600
from a self perspective experience that
 

8607
02:24:23,600 --> 02:24:25,910
from a self perspective experience that
hold that idea in our mind the way you

8608
02:24:25,910 --> 02:24:25,920
hold that idea in our mind the way you
 

8609
02:24:25,920 --> 02:24:27,990
hold that idea in our mind the way you
can experience things directly we've

8610
02:24:27,990 --> 02:24:28,000
can experience things directly we've
 

8611
02:24:28,000 --> 02:24:30,230
can experience things directly we've
evolved to experience things

8612
02:24:30,230 --> 02:24:30,240
evolved to experience things
 

8613
02:24:30,240 --> 02:24:31,110
evolved to experience things
in this

8614
02:24:31,110 --> 02:24:31,120
in this
 

8615
02:24:31,120 --> 02:24:33,030
in this
3d world

8616
02:24:33,030 --> 02:24:33,040
3d world
 

8617
02:24:33,040 --> 02:24:35,830
3d world
and it's that's a very rich experience

8618
02:24:35,830 --> 02:24:35,840
and it's that's a very rich experience
 

8619
02:24:35,840 --> 02:24:39,320
and it's that's a very rich experience
when you're thinking mathematically

8620
02:24:39,320 --> 02:24:39,330
when you're thinking mathematically

8625
02:24:42,560 --> 02:24:44,870
you still in the end of the day have to
project it down

8626
02:24:44,870 --> 02:24:44,880
project it down
 

8627
02:24:44,880 --> 02:24:45,990
project it down
to a

to make conclusions their conclusions
 

8633
02:24:50,240 --> 02:24:51,750
to make conclusions their conclusions
will be a number

8634
02:24:51,750 --> 02:24:51,760
will be a number
 

8635
02:24:51,760 --> 02:24:53,030
will be a number
or a line

02:24:58,950 --> 02:24:58,960
so i wonder like how we can really touch
 

8643
02:24:58,960 --> 02:25:00,710
so i wonder like how we can really touch
some deep truth

8644
02:25:00,710 --> 02:25:00,720
some deep truth
 

8645
02:25:00,720 --> 02:25:02,710
some deep truth
in this in a subjective way like

8646
02:25:02,710 --> 02:25:02,720
in this in a subjective way like
 

8647
02:25:02,720 --> 02:25:04,870
in this in a subjective way like
experience it really feel the beauty of

8648
02:25:04,870 --> 02:25:04,880
experience it really feel the beauty of
 

8649
02:25:04,880 --> 02:25:07,270
experience it really feel the beauty of
it you know in the way that humans feel

8650
02:25:07,270 --> 02:25:07,280
it you know in the way that humans feel
 

8651
02:25:07,280 --> 02:25:08,469
it you know in the way that humans feel
beauty

8652
02:25:08,469 --> 02:25:08,479
beauty
 

8653
02:25:08,479 --> 02:25:10,710
beauty
right are we screwed

8654
02:25:10,710 --> 02:25:10,720
right are we screwed
 

8655
02:25:10,720 --> 02:25:13,270
right are we screwed
i don't think we're screwed i think that

8656
02:25:13,270 --> 02:25:13,280
i don't think we're screwed i think that
 

8657
02:25:13,280 --> 02:25:15,190
i don't think we're screwed i think that
we get little hints of it from

8658
02:25:15,190 --> 02:25:15,200
we get little hints of it from
 

8659
02:25:15,200 --> 02:25:15,990
we get little hints of it from
from

8660
02:25:15,990 --> 02:25:16,000
from
 

8661
02:25:16,000 --> 02:25:17,910
from
psychedelic drugs and so forth we get

8662
02:25:17,910 --> 02:25:17,920
psychedelic drugs and so forth we get
 

8663
02:25:17,920 --> 02:25:19,030
psychedelic drugs and so forth we get
hints that there are certain

8664
02:25:19,030 --> 02:25:19,040
hints that there are certain
 

8665
02:25:19,040 --> 02:25:20,309
hints that there are certain
interventions that we can take on our

8666
02:25:20,309 --> 02:25:20,319
interventions that we can take on our
 

8667
02:25:20,319 --> 02:25:21,270
interventions that we can take on our
interface

8668
02:25:21,270 --> 02:25:21,280
interface
 

8669
02:25:21,280 --> 02:25:23,670
interface
i apply this chemical which is

8670
02:25:23,670 --> 02:25:23,680
i apply this chemical which is
 

8671
02:25:23,680 --> 02:25:25,990
i apply this chemical which is
just some element of my interface to

8672
02:25:25,990 --> 02:25:26,000
just some element of my interface to
 

8673
02:25:26,000 --> 02:25:27,349
just some element of my interface to
this other

8674
02:25:27,349 --> 02:25:27,359
this other
 

8675
02:25:27,359 --> 02:25:30,309
this other
to a brain i ingest it and all of a

8676
02:25:30,309 --> 02:25:30,319
to a brain i ingest it and all of a
 

8677
02:25:30,319 --> 02:25:31,349
to a brain i ingest it and all of a
sudden

8678
02:25:31,349 --> 02:25:31,359
sudden
 

8679
02:25:31,359 --> 02:25:34,150
sudden
i seem like i've opened new portals into

8680
02:25:34,150 --> 02:25:34,160
i seem like i've opened new portals into
 

8681
02:25:34,160 --> 02:25:36,230
i seem like i've opened new portals into
conscious experiences

8682
02:25:36,230 --> 02:25:36,240
conscious experiences
 

8683
02:25:36,240 --> 02:25:38,389
conscious experiences
well that's very very suggestive that's

8684
02:25:38,389 --> 02:25:38,399
well that's very very suggestive that's
 

8685
02:25:38,399 --> 02:25:41,110
well that's very very suggestive that's
like um the black body radiation doing

8686
02:25:41,110 --> 02:25:41,120
like um the black body radiation doing
 

8687
02:25:41,120 --> 02:25:42,950
like um the black body radiation doing
something that we didn't expect right it

8688
02:25:42,950 --> 02:25:42,960
something that we didn't expect right it
 

8689
02:25:42,960 --> 02:25:44,309
something that we didn't expect right it
doesn't go to infinity when we thought

8690
02:25:44,309 --> 02:25:44,319
doesn't go to infinity when we thought
 

8691
02:25:44,319 --> 02:25:45,910
doesn't go to infinity when we thought
it was going to go to infinity and we're

8692
02:25:45,910 --> 02:25:45,920
it was going to go to infinity and we're
 

8693
02:25:45,920 --> 02:25:47,270
it was going to go to infinity and we're
forced to

8694
02:25:47,270 --> 02:25:47,280
forced to
 

8695
02:25:47,280 --> 02:25:49,190
forced to
propose these quanta

8696
02:25:49,190 --> 02:25:49,200
propose these quanta
 

8697
02:25:49,200 --> 02:25:50,070
propose these quanta
so

8698
02:25:50,070 --> 02:25:50,080
so
 

8699
02:25:50,080 --> 02:25:51,510
so
once we have a theory of conscious

8700
02:25:51,510 --> 02:25:51,520
once we have a theory of conscious
 

8701
02:25:51,520 --> 02:25:53,429
once we have a theory of conscious
agents

8702
02:25:53,429 --> 02:25:53,439
agents
 

8703
02:25:53,439 --> 02:25:55,429
agents
and this projection is based on i should

8704
02:25:55,429 --> 02:25:55,439
and this projection is based on i should
 

8705
02:25:55,439 --> 02:25:57,110
and this projection is based on i should
say i should sketch what i think that

8706
02:25:57,110 --> 02:25:57,120
say i should sketch what i think that
 

8707
02:25:57,120 --> 02:25:59,190
say i should sketch what i think that
projection is um

8708
02:25:59,190 --> 02:25:59,200
projection is um
 

8709
02:25:59,200 --> 02:26:00,950
projection is um
but then i think

8710
02:26:00,950 --> 02:26:00,960
but then i think
 

8711
02:26:00,960 --> 02:26:02,469
but then i think
we can then start to ask specific

8712
02:26:02,469 --> 02:26:02,479
we can then start to ask specific
 

8713
02:26:02,479 --> 02:26:05,110
we can then start to ask specific
questions when when you're taking

8714
02:26:05,110 --> 02:26:05,120
questions when when you're taking
 

8715
02:26:05,120 --> 02:26:06,710
questions when when you're taking
dmt

8716
02:26:06,710 --> 02:26:06,720
dmt
 

8717
02:26:06,720 --> 02:26:08,070
dmt
or you're taking

8718
02:26:08,070 --> 02:26:08,080
or you're taking
 

8719
02:26:08,080 --> 02:26:10,710
or you're taking
lsd or something like that

8720
02:26:10,710 --> 02:26:10,720
lsd or something like that
 

8721
02:26:10,720 --> 02:26:12,870
lsd or something like that
now that we have this deep model that

8722
02:26:12,870 --> 02:26:12,880
now that we have this deep model that
 

8723
02:26:12,880 --> 02:26:14,469
now that we have this deep model that
we've reverse engineered space and time

8724
02:26:14,469 --> 02:26:14,479
we've reverse engineered space and time
 

8725
02:26:14,479 --> 02:26:16,550
we've reverse engineered space and time
and physical particles we've pulled them

8726
02:26:16,550 --> 02:26:16,560
and physical particles we've pulled them
 

8727
02:26:16,560 --> 02:26:18,389
and physical particles we've pulled them
back to this theory of conscious agents

8728
02:26:18,389 --> 02:26:18,399
back to this theory of conscious agents
 

8729
02:26:18,399 --> 02:26:20,309
back to this theory of conscious agents
now we can ask ourselves in this

8730
02:26:20,309 --> 02:26:20,319
now we can ask ourselves in this
 

8731
02:26:20,319 --> 02:26:22,389
now we can ask ourselves in this
idealized future

8732
02:26:22,389 --> 02:26:22,399
idealized future
 

8733
02:26:22,399 --> 02:26:23,270
idealized future
um

8734
02:26:23,270 --> 02:26:23,280
um
 

8735
02:26:23,280 --> 02:26:25,030
um
what are we doing to conscious agents

8736
02:26:25,030 --> 02:26:25,040
what are we doing to conscious agents
 

8737
02:26:25,040 --> 02:26:26,550
what are we doing to conscious agents
when we

8738
02:26:26,550 --> 02:26:26,560
when we
 

8739
02:26:26,560 --> 02:26:29,750
when we
apply 5mo dmt what are we doing

8740
02:26:29,750 --> 02:26:29,760
apply 5mo dmt what are we doing
 

8741
02:26:29,760 --> 02:26:31,750
apply 5mo dmt what are we doing
are we opening a new portal

8742
02:26:31,750 --> 02:26:31,760
are we opening a new portal
 

8743
02:26:31,760 --> 02:26:33,990
are we opening a new portal
right so when i say that i mean i have a

8744
02:26:33,990 --> 02:26:34,000
right so when i say that i mean i have a
 

8745
02:26:34,000 --> 02:26:36,950
right so when i say that i mean i have a
portal into consciousness that i call my

8746
02:26:36,950 --> 02:26:36,960
portal into consciousness that i call my
 

8747
02:26:36,960 --> 02:26:39,030
portal into consciousness that i call my
body of lex friedman that i'm creating

8748
02:26:39,030 --> 02:26:39,040
body of lex friedman that i'm creating
 

8749
02:26:39,040 --> 02:26:41,670
body of lex friedman that i'm creating
and it's a genuine portal not perfect

8750
02:26:41,670 --> 02:26:41,680
and it's a genuine portal not perfect
 

8751
02:26:41,680 --> 02:26:43,750
and it's a genuine portal not perfect
but it's a genuine portal i'm definitely

8752
02:26:43,750 --> 02:26:43,760
but it's a genuine portal i'm definitely
 

8753
02:26:43,760 --> 02:26:45,910
but it's a genuine portal i'm definitely
communicating with your consciousness

8754
02:26:45,910 --> 02:26:45,920
communicating with your consciousness
 

8755
02:26:45,920 --> 02:26:47,670
communicating with your consciousness
and we know that we have

8756
02:26:47,670 --> 02:26:47,680
and we know that we have
 

8757
02:26:47,680 --> 02:26:49,270
and we know that we have
one technology

8758
02:26:49,270 --> 02:26:49,280
one technology
 

8759
02:26:49,280 --> 02:26:51,270
one technology
for building new portals

8760
02:26:51,270 --> 02:26:51,280
for building new portals
 

8761
02:26:51,280 --> 02:26:52,630
for building new portals
we know one technology and that is

8762
02:26:52,630 --> 02:26:52,640
we know one technology and that is
 

8763
02:26:52,640 --> 02:26:54,550
we know one technology and that is
having kids

8764
02:26:54,550 --> 02:26:54,560
having kids
 

8765
02:26:54,560 --> 02:26:56,710
having kids
having kids is how we

8766
02:26:56,710 --> 02:26:56,720
having kids is how we
 

8767
02:26:56,720 --> 02:26:58,950
having kids is how we
build new portals into consciousness

8768
02:26:58,950 --> 02:26:58,960
build new portals into consciousness
 

8769
02:26:58,960 --> 02:27:00,790
build new portals into consciousness
it takes a long time can you elaborate

8770
02:27:00,790 --> 02:27:00,800
it takes a long time can you elaborate
 

8771
02:27:00,800 --> 02:27:04,790
it takes a long time can you elaborate
that oh oh oh you mean like

8772
02:27:04,790 --> 02:27:04,800
that oh oh oh you mean like
 

8773
02:27:04,800 --> 02:27:06,950
that oh oh oh you mean like
your son and your daughter didn't exist

8774
02:27:06,950 --> 02:27:06,960
your son and your daughter didn't exist
 

8775
02:27:06,960 --> 02:27:08,710
your son and your daughter didn't exist
that was a portal though you're having

8776
02:27:08,710 --> 02:27:08,720
that was a portal though you're having
 

8777
02:27:08,720 --> 02:27:10,550
that was a portal though you're having
contact with consciousness that you

8778
02:27:10,550 --> 02:27:10,560
contact with consciousness that you
 

8779
02:27:10,560 --> 02:27:12,469
contact with consciousness that you
never would have had before but now

8780
02:27:12,469 --> 02:27:12,479
never would have had before but now
 

8781
02:27:12,479 --> 02:27:14,550
never would have had before but now
you've got a son or a daughter you had

8782
02:27:14,550 --> 02:27:14,560
you've got a son or a daughter you had
 

8783
02:27:14,560 --> 02:27:16,870
you've got a son or a daughter you had
you went through this physical process

8784
02:27:16,870 --> 02:27:16,880
you went through this physical process
 

8785
02:27:16,880 --> 02:27:18,870
you went through this physical process
they were born then you

8786
02:27:18,870 --> 02:27:18,880
they were born then you
 

8787
02:27:18,880 --> 02:27:21,190
they were born then you
there was all the but is that portal

8788
02:27:21,190 --> 02:27:21,200
there was all the but is that portal
 

8789
02:27:21,200 --> 02:27:22,630
there was all the but is that portal
yours

8790
02:27:22,630 --> 02:27:22,640
yours
 

8791
02:27:22,640 --> 02:27:24,469
yours
so when you have kids are you creating

8792
02:27:24,469 --> 02:27:24,479
so when you have kids are you creating
 

8793
02:27:24,479 --> 02:27:26,230
so when you have kids are you creating
new portals that are completely distinct

8794
02:27:26,230 --> 02:27:26,240
new portals that are completely distinct
 

8795
02:27:26,240 --> 02:27:27,990
new portals that are completely distinct
from the portals that you've created

8796
02:27:27,990 --> 02:27:28,000
from the portals that you've created
 

8797
02:27:28,000 --> 02:27:29,830
from the portals that you've created
with other consciousness like can you

8798
02:27:29,830 --> 02:27:29,840
with other consciousness like can you
 

8799
02:27:29,840 --> 02:27:31,510
with other consciousness like can you
can you elaborate on that to which

8800
02:27:31,510 --> 02:27:31,520
can you elaborate on that to which
 

8801
02:27:31,520 --> 02:27:33,750
can you elaborate on that to which
degree is are the consciousness of your

8802
02:27:33,750 --> 02:27:33,760
degree is are the consciousness of your
 

8803
02:27:33,760 --> 02:27:35,270
degree is are the consciousness of your
kids

8804
02:27:35,270 --> 02:27:35,280
kids
 

8805
02:27:35,280 --> 02:27:37,190
kids
a part of you

8806
02:27:37,190 --> 02:27:37,200
a part of you
 

8807
02:27:37,200 --> 02:27:40,550
a part of you
well so every person that i see

8808
02:27:40,550 --> 02:27:40,560
well so every person that i see
 

8809
02:27:40,560 --> 02:27:42,309
well so every person that i see
that symbol that i see the body that i

8810
02:27:42,309 --> 02:27:42,319
that symbol that i see the body that i
 

8811
02:27:42,319 --> 02:27:43,030
that symbol that i see the body that i
see

8812
02:27:43,030 --> 02:27:43,040
see
 

8813
02:27:43,040 --> 02:27:45,270
see
is is a portal

8814
02:27:45,270 --> 02:27:45,280
is is a portal
 

8815
02:27:45,280 --> 02:27:47,030
is is a portal
potentially for me to interact with with

8816
02:27:47,030 --> 02:27:47,040
potentially for me to interact with with
 

8817
02:27:47,040 --> 02:27:49,670
potentially for me to interact with with
a consciousness yeah

8818
02:27:49,670 --> 02:27:49,680
a consciousness yeah
 

8819
02:27:49,680 --> 02:27:51,590
a consciousness yeah
um and

8820
02:27:51,590 --> 02:27:51,600
um and
 

8821
02:27:51,600 --> 02:27:53,030
um and
and each consciousness has a unique

8822
02:27:53,030 --> 02:27:53,040
and each consciousness has a unique
 

8823
02:27:53,040 --> 02:27:55,030
and each consciousness has a unique
character and we call it a personality

8824
02:27:55,030 --> 02:27:55,040
character and we call it a personality
 

8825
02:27:55,040 --> 02:27:57,030
character and we call it a personality
right and so forth so

8826
02:27:57,030 --> 02:27:57,040
right and so forth so
 

8827
02:27:57,040 --> 02:28:00,150
right and so forth so
with each new kid that's born we come in

8828
02:28:00,150 --> 02:28:00,160
with each new kid that's born we come in
 

8829
02:28:00,160 --> 02:28:02,550
with each new kid that's born we come in
contact with a personality that

8830
02:28:02,550 --> 02:28:02,560
contact with a personality that
 

8831
02:28:02,560 --> 02:28:04,630
contact with a personality that
we've never seen before and a

8832
02:28:04,630 --> 02:28:04,640
we've never seen before and a
 

8833
02:28:04,640 --> 02:28:05,830
we've never seen before and a
version of consciousness that we've

8834
02:28:05,830 --> 02:28:05,840
version of consciousness that we've
 

8835
02:28:05,840 --> 02:28:08,230
version of consciousness that we've
never seen before at a deeper level as i

8836
02:28:08,230 --> 02:28:08,240
never seen before at a deeper level as i
 

8837
02:28:08,240 --> 02:28:10,309
never seen before at a deeper level as i
said the theory says there's one agent

8838
02:28:10,309 --> 02:28:10,319
said the theory says there's one agent
 

8839
02:28:10,319 --> 02:28:12,630
said the theory says there's one agent
so this is a different projection

8840
02:28:12,630 --> 02:28:12,640
so this is a different projection
 

8841
02:28:12,640 --> 02:28:15,110
so this is a different projection
of that one agent

8842
02:28:15,110 --> 02:28:15,120
of that one agent
 

8843
02:28:15,120 --> 02:28:16,150
of that one agent
but but

8844
02:28:16,150 --> 02:28:16,160
but but
 

8845
02:28:16,160 --> 02:28:18,790
but but
so that's what i mean by a portal is

8846
02:28:18,790 --> 02:28:18,800
so that's what i mean by a portal is
 

8847
02:28:18,800 --> 02:28:21,190
so that's what i mean by a portal is
within my own interface my own

8848
02:28:21,190 --> 02:28:21,200
within my own interface my own
 

8849
02:28:21,200 --> 02:28:22,870
within my own interface my own
projection

8850
02:28:22,870 --> 02:28:22,880
projection
 

8851
02:28:22,880 --> 02:28:24,469
projection
can i

8852
02:28:24,469 --> 02:28:24,479
can i
 

8853
02:28:24,479 --> 02:28:27,830
can i
see other projections

8854
02:28:27,830 --> 02:28:27,840
see other projections
 

8855
02:28:27,840 --> 02:28:30,230
see other projections
of of that one consciousness so can i

8856
02:28:30,230 --> 02:28:30,240
of of that one consciousness so can i
 

8857
02:28:30,240 --> 02:28:34,150
of of that one consciousness so can i
get portals in in that sense and i

8858
02:28:34,150 --> 02:28:34,160
get portals in in that sense and i
 

8859
02:28:34,160 --> 02:28:35,750
get portals in in that sense and i
so and i think i think we will get a

8860
02:28:35,750 --> 02:28:35,760
so and i think i think we will get a
 

8861
02:28:35,760 --> 02:28:37,349
so and i think i think we will get a
theory of that that we will get a theory

8862
02:28:37,349 --> 02:28:37,359
theory of that that we will get a theory
 

8863
02:28:37,359 --> 02:28:39,110
theory of that that we will get a theory
of portals and then we can ask how the

8864
02:28:39,110 --> 02:28:39,120
of portals and then we can ask how the
 

8865
02:28:39,120 --> 02:28:40,790
of portals and then we can ask how the
psychedelics

8866
02:28:40,790 --> 02:28:40,800
psychedelics
 

8867
02:28:40,800 --> 02:28:42,309
psychedelics
are acting are they actually creating

8868
02:28:42,309 --> 02:28:42,319
are acting are they actually creating
 

8869
02:28:42,319 --> 02:28:44,070
are acting are they actually creating
new portals or not

8870
02:28:44,070 --> 02:28:44,080
new portals or not
 

8871
02:28:44,080 --> 02:28:45,510
new portals or not
if they're not

8872
02:28:45,510 --> 02:28:45,520
if they're not
 

8873
02:28:45,520 --> 02:28:47,830
if they're not
we should nevertheless then understand

8874
02:28:47,830 --> 02:28:47,840
we should nevertheless then understand
 

8875
02:28:47,840 --> 02:28:50,070
we should nevertheless then understand
how we could create a new portal right

8876
02:28:50,070 --> 02:28:50,080
how we could create a new portal right
 

8877
02:28:50,080 --> 02:28:51,670
how we could create a new portal right
maybe we have to just study what happens

8878
02:28:51,670 --> 02:28:51,680
maybe we have to just study what happens
 

8879
02:28:51,680 --> 02:28:53,750
maybe we have to just study what happens
when we make when we have kids

8880
02:28:53,750 --> 02:28:53,760
when we make when we have kids
 

8881
02:28:53,760 --> 02:28:55,910
when we make when we have kids
we know that that technology creates new

8882
02:28:55,910 --> 02:28:55,920
we know that that technology creates new
 

8883
02:28:55,920 --> 02:28:57,270
we know that that technology creates new
portals

8884
02:28:57,270 --> 02:28:57,280
portals
 

8885
02:28:57,280 --> 02:28:58,870
portals
so we have to reverse engineer that and

8886
02:28:58,870 --> 02:28:58,880
so we have to reverse engineer that and
 

8887
02:28:58,880 --> 02:29:03,670
so we have to reverse engineer that and
then say okay could we somehow

8888
02:29:03,670 --> 02:29:03,680

 

8889
02:29:03,680 --> 02:29:04,550

create

8890
02:29:04,550 --> 02:29:04,560
create
 

8891
02:29:04,560 --> 02:29:08,150
create
new portals de novo with that

8892
02:29:08,150 --> 02:29:08,160
new portals de novo with that
 

8893
02:29:08,160 --> 02:29:09,190
new portals de novo with that
uh

8894
02:29:09,190 --> 02:29:09,200
uh
 

8895
02:29:09,200 --> 02:29:10,790
uh
like uh brain computer interfaces for

8896
02:29:10,790 --> 02:29:10,800
like uh brain computer interfaces for
 

8897
02:29:10,800 --> 02:29:12,230
like uh brain computer interfaces for
example yeah so maybe just a chemical or

8898
02:29:12,230 --> 02:29:12,240
example yeah so maybe just a chemical or
 

8899
02:29:12,240 --> 02:29:13,990
example yeah so maybe just a chemical or
something else probably more complicated

8900
02:29:13,990 --> 02:29:14,000
something else probably more complicated
 

8901
02:29:14,000 --> 02:29:15,030
something else probably more complicated
than a chemical that's why i think that

8902
02:29:15,030 --> 02:29:15,040
than a chemical that's why i think that
 

8903
02:29:15,040 --> 02:29:17,510
than a chemical that's why i think that
the psychedelics the psychedelics may

8904
02:29:17,510 --> 02:29:17,520
the psychedelics the psychedelics may
 

8905
02:29:17,520 --> 02:29:19,030
the psychedelics the psychedelics may
because they might be affecting this

8906
02:29:19,030 --> 02:29:19,040
because they might be affecting this
 

8907
02:29:19,040 --> 02:29:21,110
because they might be affecting this
portal in certain ways that it turns it

8908
02:29:21,110 --> 02:29:21,120
portal in certain ways that it turns it
 

8909
02:29:21,120 --> 02:29:22,630
portal in certain ways that it turns it
around and opens up

8910
02:29:22,630 --> 02:29:22,640
around and opens up
 

8911
02:29:22,640 --> 02:29:23,830
around and opens up
in other words it may be once we

8912
02:29:23,830 --> 02:29:23,840
in other words it may be once we
 

8913
02:29:23,840 --> 02:29:25,830
in other words it may be once we
understand what this thing is important

8914
02:29:25,830 --> 02:29:25,840
understand what this thing is important
 

8915
02:29:25,840 --> 02:29:27,750
understand what this thing is important
your body as a portal and understand all

8916
02:29:27,750 --> 02:29:27,760
your body as a portal and understand all
 

8917
02:29:27,760 --> 02:29:29,429
your body as a portal and understand all
those complexities maybe we'll realize

8918
02:29:29,429 --> 02:29:29,439
those complexities maybe we'll realize
 

8919
02:29:29,439 --> 02:29:31,510
those complexities maybe we'll realize
that that portal can be shifted and into

8920
02:29:31,510 --> 02:29:31,520
that that portal can be shifted and into
 

8921
02:29:31,520 --> 02:29:33,270
that that portal can be shifted and into
different parts of the the deeper

8922
02:29:33,270 --> 02:29:33,280
different parts of the the deeper
 

8923
02:29:33,280 --> 02:29:36,230
different parts of the the deeper
consciousness and give new windows on it

8924
02:29:36,230 --> 02:29:36,240
consciousness and give new windows on it
 

8925
02:29:36,240 --> 02:29:38,710
consciousness and give new windows on it
and so in that way maybe yes

8926
02:29:38,710 --> 02:29:38,720
and so in that way maybe yes
 

8927
02:29:38,720 --> 02:29:41,030
and so in that way maybe yes
psychedelics could open up new portals

8928
02:29:41,030 --> 02:29:41,040
psychedelics could open up new portals
 

8929
02:29:41,040 --> 02:29:41,830
psychedelics could open up new portals
in the sense that they're taking

8930
02:29:41,830 --> 02:29:41,840
in the sense that they're taking
 

8931
02:29:41,840 --> 02:29:43,270
in the sense that they're taking
something that's already a complex

8932
02:29:43,270 --> 02:29:43,280
something that's already a complex
 

8933
02:29:43,280 --> 02:29:45,750
something that's already a complex
portal and just tweaking it a bit

8934
02:29:45,750 --> 02:29:45,760
portal and just tweaking it a bit
 

8935
02:29:45,760 --> 02:29:47,990
portal and just tweaking it a bit
well but creating is a very powerful

8936
02:29:47,990 --> 02:29:48,000
well but creating is a very powerful
 

8937
02:29:48,000 --> 02:29:50,389
well but creating is a very powerful
difference between morphing

8938
02:29:50,389 --> 02:29:50,399
difference between morphing
 

8939
02:29:50,399 --> 02:29:52,389
difference between morphing
right right tweaking versus creating i

8940
02:29:52,389 --> 02:29:52,399
right right tweaking versus creating i
 

8941
02:29:52,399 --> 02:29:53,750
right right tweaking versus creating i
agree

8942
02:29:53,750 --> 02:29:53,760
agree
 

8943
02:29:53,760 --> 02:29:56,070
agree
but maybe it gives you intuition to at

8944
02:29:56,070 --> 02:29:56,080
but maybe it gives you intuition to at
 

8945
02:29:56,080 --> 02:29:58,469
but maybe it gives you intuition to at
least the full space of the kinds of

8946
02:29:58,469 --> 02:29:58,479
least the full space of the kinds of
 

8947
02:29:58,479 --> 02:30:00,150
least the full space of the kinds of
things that this particular system is

8948
02:30:00,150 --> 02:30:00,160
things that this particular system is
 

8949
02:30:00,160 --> 02:30:02,950
things that this particular system is
capable of i mean i mean the idea your

8950
02:30:02,950 --> 02:30:02,960
capable of i mean i mean the idea your
 

8951
02:30:02,960 --> 02:30:05,110
capable of i mean i mean the idea your
idea the consciousness creates brains i

8952
02:30:05,110 --> 02:30:05,120
idea the consciousness creates brains i
 

8953
02:30:05,120 --> 02:30:06,070
idea the consciousness creates brains i
mean

8954
02:30:06,070 --> 02:30:06,080
mean
 

8955
02:30:06,080 --> 02:30:08,309
mean
that breaks my brain because

8956
02:30:08,309 --> 02:30:08,319
that breaks my brain because
 

8957
02:30:08,319 --> 02:30:10,790
that breaks my brain because
because i you know i'm i'm i guess i'm

8958
02:30:10,790 --> 02:30:10,800
because i you know i'm i'm i guess i'm
 

8959
02:30:10,800 --> 02:30:12,710
because i you know i'm i'm i guess i'm
still a physicalist in that sense

8960
02:30:12,710 --> 02:30:12,720
still a physicalist in that sense
 

8961
02:30:12,720 --> 02:30:13,990
still a physicalist in that sense
because that you could

8962
02:30:13,990 --> 02:30:14,000
because that you could
 

8963
02:30:14,000 --> 02:30:16,550
because that you could
it's just much easier

8964
02:30:16,550 --> 02:30:16,560
it's just much easier
 

8965
02:30:16,560 --> 02:30:18,389
it's just much easier
to intuit the world

8966
02:30:18,389 --> 02:30:18,399
to intuit the world
 

8967
02:30:18,399 --> 02:30:21,429
to intuit the world
um it's very it's practical to think all

8968
02:30:21,429 --> 02:30:21,439
um it's very it's practical to think all
 

8969
02:30:21,439 --> 02:30:23,910
um it's very it's practical to think all
right there's a neural network and

8970
02:30:23,910 --> 02:30:23,920
right there's a neural network and
 

8971
02:30:23,920 --> 02:30:28,389
right there's a neural network and
what are the different ways fascinating

8972
02:30:28,389 --> 02:30:28,399
what are the different ways fascinating
 

8973
02:30:28,399 --> 02:30:31,110
what are the different ways fascinating
uh capabilities can emerge from this

8974
02:30:31,110 --> 02:30:31,120
uh capabilities can emerge from this
 

8975
02:30:31,120 --> 02:30:33,190
uh capabilities can emerge from this
neural network uh

8976
02:30:33,190 --> 02:30:33,200
neural network uh
 

8977
02:30:33,200 --> 02:30:35,110
neural network uh
it's free it's easier and so you start

8978
02:30:35,110 --> 02:30:35,120
it's free it's easier and so you start
 

8979
02:30:35,120 --> 02:30:36,309
it's free it's easier and so you start
to

8980
02:30:36,309 --> 02:30:36,319
to
 

8981
02:30:36,319 --> 02:30:38,230
to
and then present to yourself the problem

8982
02:30:38,230 --> 02:30:38,240
and then present to yourself the problem
 

8983
02:30:38,240 --> 02:30:39,830
and then present to yourself the problem
of okay well how does consciousness

we're we're doing something that really
 

9049
02:31:46,560 --> 02:31:48,469
we're we're doing something that really
is fun and new

9050
02:31:48,469 --> 02:31:48,479
is fun and new
 

9051
02:31:48,479 --> 02:31:50,630
is fun and new
and and

9052
02:31:50,630 --> 02:31:50,640
and and
 

9053
02:31:50,640 --> 02:31:52,070
and and
they're having a blast and they're

02:31:52,070 --> 02:31:52,080
they're having a blast and they're
 

9055
02:31:52,080 --> 02:31:54,150
they're having a blast and they're
finding all all these new structures so

9056
02:31:54,150 --> 02:31:54,160
finding all all these new structures so
 

9057
02:31:54,160 --> 02:31:59,030
finding all all these new structures so
so i i think that we're going to um

9058
02:31:59,030 --> 02:31:59,040

in
 

9063
02:32:01,760 --> 02:32:03,670
in
getting a new deeper theory i can just

9064
02:32:03,670 --> 02:32:03,680
getting a new deeper theory i can just
 

9065
02:32:03,680 --> 02:32:05,270
getting a new deeper theory i can just
say what i'm hoping with the theory that

9066
02:32:05,270 --> 02:32:05,280
say what i'm hoping with the theory that
 

9067
02:32:05,280 --> 02:32:08,550
say what i'm hoping with the theory that
i'm working on i'm hoping to show that i

9068
02:32:08,550 --> 02:32:08,560
i'm working on i'm hoping to show that i
 

9069
02:32:08,560 --> 02:32:10,150
i'm working on i'm hoping to show that i
could have this timeless dynamics of

02:32:10,160 --> 02:32:12,550
could have this timeless dynamics of
consciousness no entropic time

9072
02:32:12,550 --> 02:32:12,560
consciousness no entropic time
 

9073
02:32:12,560 --> 02:32:15,030
consciousness no entropic time
i take a projection and i show how this

9074
02:32:15,030 --> 02:32:15,040
i take a projection and i show how this
 

9075
02:32:15,040 --> 02:32:17,110
i take a projection and i show how this
timeless dynamics looks like the big

9076
02:32:17,110 --> 02:32:17,120
timeless dynamics looks like the big
 

9077
02:32:17,120 --> 02:32:18,870
timeless dynamics looks like the big
bang

9078
02:32:18,870 --> 02:32:18,880
bang
 

9079
02:32:18,880 --> 02:32:21,670
bang
and the entire evolution of space-time

9080
02:32:21,670 --> 02:32:21,680
and the entire evolution of space-time
 

9081
02:32:21,680 --> 02:32:23,270
and the entire evolution of space-time
in other words i see how my whole space

9082
02:32:23,270 --> 02:32:23,280
in other words i see how my whole space
 

9083
02:32:23,280 --> 02:32:25,030
in other words i see how my whole space
time interface

9084
02:32:25,030 --> 02:32:25,040
time interface
 

9085
02:32:25,040 --> 02:32:27,830
time interface
so not just the uh the projections just

9086
02:32:27,830 --> 02:32:27,840
so not just the uh the projections just
 

9087
02:32:27,840 --> 02:32:29,750
so not just the uh the projections just
doesn't just look like space-time you

9088
02:32:29,750 --> 02:32:29,760
doesn't just look like space-time you
 

9089
02:32:29,760 --> 02:32:31,349
doesn't just look like space-time you
can explain

9090
02:32:31,349 --> 02:32:31,359
can explain
 

9091
02:32:31,359 --> 02:32:32,870
can explain
the whole with it the whole from the

9092
02:32:32,870 --> 02:32:32,880
the whole with it the whole from the
 

9093
02:32:32,880 --> 02:32:34,710
the whole with it the whole from the
origin of the universe that's that's

9094
02:32:34,710 --> 02:32:34,720
origin of the universe that's that's
 

9095
02:32:34,720 --> 02:32:36,070
origin of the universe that's that's
what we have to do and that's what the

9096
02:32:36,070 --> 02:32:36,080
what we have to do and that's what the
 

9097
02:32:36,080 --> 02:32:37,429
what we have to do and that's what the
physicists understand when they go

9098
02:32:37,429 --> 02:32:37,439
physicists understand when they go
 

9099
02:32:37,439 --> 02:32:39,190
physicists understand when they go
beyond space time to the amplitude and

9100
02:32:39,190 --> 02:32:39,200
beyond space time to the amplitude and
 

9101
02:32:39,200 --> 02:32:41,110
beyond space time to the amplitude and
the cosmological polytube they

9102
02:32:41,110 --> 02:32:41,120
the cosmological polytube they
 

9103
02:32:41,120 --> 02:32:42,710
the cosmological polytube they
ultimately know that they have to get

9104
02:32:42,710 --> 02:32:42,720
ultimately know that they have to get
 

9105
02:32:42,720 --> 02:32:45,670
ultimately know that they have to get
back the big bang story and the whole

9106
02:32:45,670 --> 02:32:45,680
back the big bang story and the whole
 

9107
02:32:45,680 --> 02:32:48,070
back the big bang story and the whole
evolution that whole story where there

9108
02:32:48,070 --> 02:32:48,080
evolution that whole story where there
 

9109
02:32:48,080 --> 02:32:50,710
evolution that whole story where there
were no living things there was just

9110
02:32:50,710 --> 02:32:50,720
were no living things there was just
 

9111
02:32:50,720 --> 02:32:53,830
were no living things there was just
a point and then the explosion and then

02:32:53,830 --> 02:32:53,840
a point and then the explosion and then
 

9113
02:32:53,840 --> 02:32:55,750
a point and then the explosion and then
just particles at high energy and then

02:32:55,750 --> 02:32:55,760
just particles at high energy and then
 

9115
02:32:55,760 --> 02:32:57,670
just particles at high energy and then
eventually the cooling down and the

02:33:02,710 --> 02:33:02,720
condenses and then life and then
 

9123
02:33:02,720 --> 02:33:04,790
condenses and then life and then
consciousness that whole story has to

9124
02:33:04,790 --> 02:33:04,800
consciousness that whole story has to
 

9125
02:33:04,800 --> 02:33:06,469
consciousness that whole story has to
come out of something that's deeper and

9126
02:33:06,469 --> 02:33:06,479
come out of something that's deeper and
 

9127
02:33:06,479 --> 02:33:09,030
come out of something that's deeper and
without time and that's what what we're

9128
02:33:09,030 --> 02:33:09,040
without time and that's what what we're
 

9129
02:33:09,040 --> 02:33:11,910
without time and that's what what we're
up to that's we we want to to get this

brains evolved in unconsciousness will
 

9137
02:33:17,120 --> 02:33:19,110
brains evolved in unconsciousness will
come out of a much deeper theory and and

9138
02:33:19,110 --> 02:33:19,120
come out of a much deeper theory and and
 

9139

uh kids these days with their non-space
 

9161
02:33:46,479 --> 02:33:48,469
uh kids these days with their non-space
time assumptions

9162
02:33:48,469 --> 02:33:48,479
time assumptions
 

9163
02:33:48,479 --> 02:33:50,230
time assumptions
uh it's just interesting looking at the

9164
02:33:50,230 --> 02:33:50,240
uh it's just interesting looking at the
 

9165
02:33:50,240 --> 02:33:52,070
uh it's just interesting looking at the
philosophical tradition of this

9166
02:33:52,070 --> 02:33:52,080
philosophical tradition of this
 

9167
02:33:52,080 --> 02:33:53,990
philosophical tradition of this
difficult ideas you struggle with if you

9168
02:33:53,990 --> 02:33:54,000
difficult ideas you struggle with if you
 

9169
02:33:54,000 --> 02:33:55,190
difficult ideas you struggle with if you
look like somebody

9170
02:33:55,190 --> 02:33:55,200
look like somebody
 

9171
02:33:55,200 --> 02:33:56,309
look like somebody
like

9172
02:33:56,309 --> 02:33:56,319
like
 

9173
02:33:56,319 --> 02:33:58,630

emmanuel kant what are some interesting

9174
02:33:58,630 --> 02:33:58,640
emmanuel kant what are some interesting
 

9175
02:33:58,640 --> 02:34:00,830
emmanuel kant what are some interesting
agreements and disagreements you

9176
02:34:00,830 --> 02:34:00,840
agreements and disagreements you
 

9177
02:34:00,840 --> 02:34:03,429
agreements and disagreements you
have uh with a guy about the nature of

9178
02:34:03,429 --> 02:34:03,439
have uh with a guy about the nature of
 

9179
02:34:03,439 --> 02:34:04,790
have uh with a guy about the nature of
reality

9180
02:34:04,790 --> 02:34:04,800
reality
 

9181
02:34:04,800 --> 02:34:07,429
reality
so there's a lot in agreement right so

9182
02:34:07,429 --> 02:34:07,439
so there's a lot in agreement right so
 

9183
02:34:07,439 --> 02:34:09,910
so there's a lot in agreement right so
kant was an idealist

9184
02:34:09,910 --> 02:34:09,920
kant was an idealist
 

9185
02:34:09,920 --> 02:34:13,190
kant was an idealist
transcendental ideas and

9186
02:34:13,190 --> 02:34:13,200

 

9187
02:34:13,200 --> 02:34:17,990

he he basically had the idea that um

9188
02:34:17,990 --> 02:34:18,000

 

9189
02:34:18,000 --> 02:34:19,830

we don't see nature as it is we impose

9190
02:34:19,830 --> 02:34:19,840
we don't see nature as it is we impose
 

9191
02:34:19,840 --> 02:34:23,349
we don't see nature as it is we impose
the structure on nature

9192
02:34:23,349 --> 02:34:23,359

 

9193
02:34:23,359 --> 02:34:25,830

he

9194
02:34:25,830 --> 02:34:25,840

 

9195
02:34:25,840 --> 02:34:28,230

and and so in some sense i'm saying

9196
02:34:28,230 --> 02:34:28,240
and and so in some sense i'm saying
 

9197
02:34:28,240 --> 02:34:30,230
and and so in some sense i'm saying
something similar i'm saying that by the

9198
02:34:30,230 --> 02:34:30,240
something similar i'm saying that by the
 

9199
02:34:30,240 --> 02:34:31,590
something similar i'm saying that by the
way i don't call myself an idealist i

9200
02:34:31,590 --> 02:34:31,600
way i don't call myself an idealist i
 

9201
02:34:31,600 --> 02:34:33,590
way i don't call myself an idealist i
call myself a conscious realist because

9202
02:34:33,590 --> 02:34:33,600
call myself a conscious realist because
 

9203
02:34:33,600 --> 02:34:35,750
call myself a conscious realist because
idealism has a long history a lot of

different
ideas come under idealism and there's a

9208
02:34:38,630 --> 02:34:38,640
ideas come under idealism and there's a
 

9209
02:34:38,640 --> 02:34:41,990
ideas come under idealism and there's a
lot of debates and so forth it this

9210
02:34:41,990 --> 02:34:42,000
lot of debates and so forth it this
 

9211
02:34:42,000 --> 02:34:44,070
lot of debates and so forth it this
tends to be identified with in many

9212
02:34:44,070 --> 02:34:44,080
tends to be identified with in many
 

9213
02:34:44,080 --> 02:34:46,469
tends to be identified with in many
cases anti-science and anti-realism

9214
02:34:46,469 --> 02:34:46,479
cases anti-science and anti-realism
 

9215
02:34:46,479 --> 02:34:48,710
cases anti-science and anti-realism
and i don't want either connection with

9216
02:34:48,710 --> 02:34:48,720
and i don't want either connection with
 

9217
02:34:48,720 --> 02:34:50,630
and i don't want either connection with
my ideas and so i just called mine

9218
02:34:50,630 --> 02:34:50,640
my ideas and so i just called mine
 

9219
02:34:50,640 --> 02:34:52,150
my ideas and so i just called mine
conscious realism with an emphasis on

02:34:52,150 --> 02:34:52,160
conscious realism with an emphasis on

and not and not anti-realism
 

9225
02:34:56,319 --> 02:34:58,550
and not and not anti-realism
but but the one place where i would of

9226
02:34:58,550 --> 02:34:58,560
but but the one place where i would of
 

9227
02:34:58,560 --> 02:34:59,910
but but the one place where i would of
course disagree with kant was that he

9228
02:34:59,910 --> 02:34:59,920
course disagree with kant was that he
 

9229
02:34:59,920 --> 02:35:01,510
course disagree with kant was that he
thought that um

9230
02:35:01,510 --> 02:35:01,520
thought that um
 

9231
02:35:01,520 --> 02:35:02,870
thought that um
euclidean

9232
02:35:02,870 --> 02:35:02,880
euclidean
 

9233
02:35:02,880 --> 02:35:05,190
euclidean
space time was a priori

9234
02:35:05,190 --> 02:35:05,200
space time was a priori
 

9235
02:35:05,200 --> 02:35:08,070
space time was a priori
right we just know that that's false

9236
02:35:08,070 --> 02:35:08,080
right we just know that that's false
 

9237
02:35:08,080 --> 02:35:11,190
right we just know that that's false
so so he he went went to too far

9238
02:35:11,190 --> 02:35:11,200
so so he he went went to too far
 

9239
02:35:11,200 --> 02:35:13,190
so so he he went went to too far
on that but

9240
02:35:13,190 --> 02:35:13,200
on that but
 

9241
02:35:13,200 --> 02:35:15,270
on that but
but in in general the idea that we don't

9242
02:35:15,270 --> 02:35:15,280
but in in general the idea that we don't
 

9243
02:35:15,280 --> 02:35:16,550
but in in general the idea that we don't
start with space time that space and

9244
02:35:16,550 --> 02:35:16,560
start with space time that space and
 

9245
02:35:16,560 --> 02:35:18,150
start with space time that space and
time is in some sense forms of our

9246
02:35:18,150 --> 02:35:18,160
time is in some sense forms of our
 

9247
02:35:18,160 --> 02:35:21,429
time is in some sense forms of our
perceptions yes absolutely

9248
02:35:21,429 --> 02:35:21,439
perceptions yes absolutely
 

9249
02:35:21,439 --> 02:35:22,309
perceptions yes absolutely
and

9250
02:35:22,309 --> 02:35:22,319
and
 

9251
02:35:22,319 --> 02:35:23,750
and
i would say that

9252
02:35:23,750 --> 02:35:23,760
i would say that
 

9253
02:35:23,760 --> 02:35:25,590
i would say that
you know there's a lot in common with

9254
02:35:25,590 --> 02:35:25,600
you know there's a lot in common with
 

9255
02:35:25,600 --> 02:35:28,950
you know there's a lot in common with
barclay in that regard

9256
02:35:28,950 --> 02:35:28,960
barclay in that regard
 

9257
02:35:28,960 --> 02:35:30,630
barclay in that regard
there's a lot of ingenious arguments in

9258
02:35:30,630 --> 02:35:30,640
there's a lot of ingenious arguments in
 

9259
02:35:30,640 --> 02:35:31,670
there's a lot of ingenious arguments in
barclay

9260

leibniz

9262
02:35:33,429 --> 02:35:33,439
leibniz
 

9263
02:35:33,439 --> 02:35:35,910
leibniz
leibniz in his monodology

9264
02:35:35,910 --> 02:35:35,920
leibniz in his monodology
 

9265
02:35:35,920 --> 02:35:37,349
leibniz in his monodology
understood very clearly that the hard

9266
02:35:37,349 --> 02:35:37,359
understood very clearly that the hard
 

9267
02:35:37,359 --> 02:35:39,190
understood very clearly that the hard
problem was not solvable

9268
02:35:39,190 --> 02:35:39,200
problem was not solvable
 

9269
02:35:39,200 --> 02:35:41,270
problem was not solvable
he posed a hard problem and basically

9270
02:35:41,270 --> 02:35:41,280
he posed a hard problem and basically
 

9271
02:35:41,280 --> 02:35:43,830
he posed a hard problem and basically
dismissed it and just you can't do this

9272
02:35:43,830 --> 02:35:43,840
dismissed it and just you can't do this
 

9273
02:35:43,840 --> 02:35:46,150
dismissed it and just you can't do this
and so if he came here he

9274
02:35:46,150 --> 02:35:46,160
and so if he came here he
 

9275
02:35:46,160 --> 02:35:48,230
and so if he came here he
and saw where we are he said look guys i

9276
02:35:48,230 --> 02:35:48,240
and saw where we are he said look guys i
 

9277
02:35:48,240 --> 02:35:50,710
and saw where we are he said look guys i
told you this 300 years ago and he had

9278
02:35:50,710 --> 02:35:50,720
told you this 300 years ago and he had
 

9279
02:35:50,720 --> 02:35:52,870
told you this 300 years ago and he had
his momentology he was trying

9280
02:35:52,870 --> 02:35:52,880
his momentology he was trying
 

9281
02:35:52,880 --> 02:35:55,190
his momentology he was trying
to do something like this it's

9282
02:35:55,190 --> 02:35:55,200
to do something like this it's
 

9283
02:35:55,200 --> 02:35:56,150
to do something like this it's
um

9284
02:35:56,150 --> 02:35:56,160
um
 

9285
02:35:56,160 --> 02:35:57,349
um
it's different from what i'm doing but

9286
02:35:57,349 --> 02:35:57,359
it's different from what i'm doing but
 

9287
02:35:57,359 --> 02:35:58,630
it's different from what i'm doing but
he had these things that were not in

9288
02:35:58,630 --> 02:35:58,640
he had these things that were not in
 

9289
02:35:58,640 --> 02:36:00,790
he had these things that were not in
space and time the these moan ads he was

9290
02:36:00,790 --> 02:36:00,800
space and time the these moan ads he was
 

9291
02:36:00,800 --> 02:36:02,150
space and time the these moan ads he was
trying to build something

9292
02:36:02,150 --> 02:36:02,160
trying to build something
 

9293
02:36:02,160 --> 02:36:03,429
trying to build something
um

9294
02:36:03,429 --> 02:36:03,439
um
 

9295
02:36:03,439 --> 02:36:04,389
um
i'm trying to build a theory of

9296
02:36:04,389 --> 02:36:04,399
i'm trying to build a theory of
 

9297
02:36:04,399 --> 02:36:07,510
i'm trying to build a theory of
conscious agents my guess is that if

9298
02:36:07,510 --> 02:36:07,520
conscious agents my guess is that if
 

9299
02:36:07,520 --> 02:36:09,270
conscious agents my guess is that if
he came here i could just

9300
02:36:09,270 --> 02:36:09,280
he came here i could just
 

9301
02:36:09,280 --> 02:36:11,910
he came here i could just
if he saw what i was doing he would say

9302
02:36:11,910 --> 02:36:11,920
if he saw what i was doing he would say
 

9303
02:36:11,920 --> 02:36:14,309
if he saw what i was doing he would say
he would understand it and immediately

9304
02:36:14,309 --> 02:36:14,319
he would understand it and immediately
 

9305
02:36:14,319 --> 02:36:16,630
he would understand it and immediately
take off with it and go places that i

9306
02:36:16,630 --> 02:36:16,640
take off with it and go places that i
 

9307
02:36:16,640 --> 02:36:18,550
take off with it and go places that i
couldn't he he would he would so there

9308
02:36:18,550 --> 02:36:18,560
couldn't he he would he would so there
 

9309
02:36:18,560 --> 02:36:19,670
couldn't he he would he would so there
would be

9310
02:36:19,670 --> 02:36:19,680
would be
 

9311
02:36:19,680 --> 02:36:22,230
would be
right there would be overlap of uh the

9312
02:36:22,230 --> 02:36:22,240
right there would be overlap of uh the
 

9313
02:36:22,240 --> 02:36:24,389
right there would be overlap of uh the
spirit of the ideas absolutely totally

9314
02:36:24,389 --> 02:36:24,399
spirit of the ideas absolutely totally
 

9315
02:36:24,399 --> 02:36:26,230
spirit of the ideas absolutely totally
overlapping but his genius would then

9316
02:36:26,230 --> 02:36:26,240
overlapping but his genius would then
 

9317
02:36:26,240 --> 02:36:27,910
overlapping but his genius would then
just run with it far faster than i could

9318
02:36:27,910 --> 02:36:27,920
just run with it far faster than i could
 

9319
02:36:27,920 --> 02:36:29,750
just run with it far faster than i could
i love the humility here

9320
02:36:29,750 --> 02:36:29,760
i love the humility here
 

9321
02:36:29,760 --> 02:36:31,270
i love the humility here
so let me ask you about sort of

9322
02:36:31,270 --> 02:36:31,280
so let me ask you about sort of
 

9323
02:36:31,280 --> 02:36:33,670
so let me ask you about sort of
practical implications of your ideas to

9324
02:36:33,670 --> 02:36:33,680
practical implications of your ideas to
 

9325
02:36:33,680 --> 02:36:36,550
practical implications of your ideas to
our world our complicated world when you

9326
02:36:36,550 --> 02:36:36,560
our world our complicated world when you
 

9327
02:36:36,560 --> 02:36:40,389
our world our complicated world when you
look at the big questions of humanity of

9328
02:36:40,389 --> 02:36:40,399
look at the big questions of humanity of
 

9329
02:36:40,399 --> 02:36:42,790
look at the big questions of humanity of
hate

9330
02:36:42,790 --> 02:36:42,800
hate
 

9331
02:36:42,800 --> 02:36:45,510
hate
war

9332
02:36:45,510 --> 02:36:45,520

 

9333
02:36:45,520 --> 02:36:48,389

what else is there evil

9334
02:36:48,389 --> 02:36:48,399
what else is there evil
 

9335
02:36:48,399 --> 02:36:50,389
what else is there evil
maybe there's the positive aspects of

9336
02:36:50,389 --> 02:36:50,399
maybe there's the positive aspects of
 

9337
02:36:50,399 --> 02:36:51,349
maybe there's the positive aspects of
that

9338
02:36:51,349 --> 02:36:51,359
that
 

9339
02:36:51,359 --> 02:36:54,070
that
of meaning of love

9340
02:36:54,070 --> 02:36:54,080
of meaning of love
 

9341
02:36:54,080 --> 02:36:57,349
of meaning of love
um what is the fact that

9342
02:36:57,349 --> 02:36:57,359
um what is the fact that
 

9343
02:36:57,359 --> 02:37:00,230
um what is the fact that
reality is an illusion

9344
02:37:00,230 --> 02:37:00,240
reality is an illusion
 

9345
02:37:00,240 --> 02:37:01,750
reality is an illusion
perceived

9346
02:37:01,750 --> 02:37:01,760
perceived
 

9347
02:37:01,760 --> 02:37:05,429
perceived
what what is the conscious realism

9348
02:37:05,429 --> 02:37:05,439
what what is the conscious realism
 

9349
02:37:05,439 --> 02:37:07,830
what what is the conscious realism
when applied to daily life what kind of

9350
02:37:07,830 --> 02:37:07,840
when applied to daily life what kind of
 

9351
02:37:07,840 --> 02:37:11,349
when applied to daily life what kind of
impact does it have a lot and it's it's

9352
02:37:11,349 --> 02:37:11,359
impact does it have a lot and it's it's
 

9353
02:37:11,359 --> 02:37:13,030
impact does it have a lot and it's it's
sort of scary

9354
02:37:13,030 --> 02:37:13,040
sort of scary
 

9355
02:37:13,040 --> 02:37:15,270
sort of scary
um

9356
02:37:15,270 --> 02:37:15,280
um
 

9357
02:37:15,280 --> 02:37:16,830
um
we all know that life is

9358
02:37:16,830 --> 02:37:16,840
we all know that life is
 

9359
02:37:16,840 --> 02:37:19,910
we all know that life is
ephemeral and spiritual traditions have

9360
02:37:19,910 --> 02:37:19,920
ephemeral and spiritual traditions have
 

9361
02:37:19,920 --> 02:37:21,670
ephemeral and spiritual traditions have
said wake up to the fact that you know

9362
02:37:21,670 --> 02:37:21,680
said wake up to the fact that you know
 

9363
02:37:21,680 --> 02:37:22,790
said wake up to the fact that you know
anything that you do here is going to

9364
02:37:22,790 --> 02:37:22,800
anything that you do here is going to
 

9365
02:37:22,800 --> 02:37:24,309
anything that you do here is going to
disappear

9366
02:37:24,309 --> 02:37:24,319
disappear
 

9367
02:37:24,319 --> 02:37:25,910
disappear
but it's even more ephemeral than

9368
02:37:25,910 --> 02:37:25,920
but it's even more ephemeral than
 

9369
02:37:25,920 --> 02:37:29,670
but it's even more ephemeral than
perhaps we've thought i see this bottle

9370
02:37:29,670 --> 02:37:29,680
perhaps we've thought i see this bottle
 

9371
02:37:29,680 --> 02:37:31,110
perhaps we've thought i see this bottle
because i create it right now as soon as

9372
02:37:31,110 --> 02:37:31,120
because i create it right now as soon as
 

9373
02:37:31,120 --> 02:37:33,510
because i create it right now as soon as
i look away

9374
02:37:33,510 --> 02:37:33,520
i look away
 

9375
02:37:33,520 --> 02:37:35,030
i look away
that data structure has been garbage

9376
02:37:35,030 --> 02:37:35,040
that data structure has been garbage
 

9377
02:37:35,040 --> 02:37:37,270
that data structure has been garbage
collected that bottle

9378
02:37:37,270 --> 02:37:37,280
collected that bottle
 

9379
02:37:37,280 --> 02:37:38,710
collected that bottle
i have to recreate it every time i look

9380
02:37:38,710 --> 02:37:38,720
i have to recreate it every time i look
 

9381
02:37:38,720 --> 02:37:40,710
i have to recreate it every time i look
so i spend all my money i buy this fancy

9382
02:37:40,710 --> 02:37:40,720
so i spend all my money i buy this fancy
 

9383
02:37:40,720 --> 02:37:42,230
so i spend all my money i buy this fancy
car

9384
02:37:42,230 --> 02:37:42,240
car
 

9385
02:37:42,240 --> 02:37:44,230
car
that car i have to keep recreating it

9386
02:37:44,230 --> 02:37:44,240
that car i have to keep recreating it
 

9387
02:37:44,240 --> 02:37:45,429
that car i have to keep recreating it
every time i look at it it's that

9388
02:37:45,429 --> 02:37:45,439
every time i look at it it's that
 

9389
02:37:45,439 --> 02:37:46,389
every time i look at it it's that
ephemeral

9390
02:37:46,389 --> 02:37:46,399
ephemeral
 

9391
02:37:46,399 --> 02:37:48,870
ephemeral
so all the things that we

9392
02:37:48,870 --> 02:37:48,880
so all the things that we
 

9393
02:37:48,880 --> 02:37:51,110
so all the things that we
invest ourselves in we fight over we

9394
02:37:51,110 --> 02:37:51,120
invest ourselves in we fight over we
 

9395
02:37:51,120 --> 02:37:52,870
invest ourselves in we fight over we
kill each other over and we have wars

9396
02:37:52,870 --> 02:37:52,880
kill each other over and we have wars
 

9397
02:37:52,880 --> 02:37:54,710
kill each other over and we have wars
over

9398
02:37:54,710 --> 02:37:54,720
over
 

9399
02:37:54,720 --> 02:37:56,550
over
these are all it's just like people in a

9400
02:37:56,550 --> 02:37:56,560
these are all it's just like people in a
 

9401
02:37:56,560 --> 02:37:58,950
these are all it's just like people in a
virtual reality simulation

9402
02:37:58,950 --> 02:37:58,960
virtual reality simulation
 

9403
02:37:58,960 --> 02:38:02,230
virtual reality simulation
right and and there's this this porsche

9404
02:38:02,230 --> 02:38:02,240
right and and there's this this porsche
 

9405
02:38:02,240 --> 02:38:04,389
right and and there's this this porsche
and we all see the porsche well

9406
02:38:04,389 --> 02:38:04,399
and we all see the porsche well
 

9407
02:38:04,399 --> 02:38:06,630
and we all see the porsche well
where that porsche exists when i look at

9408
02:38:06,630 --> 02:38:06,640
where that porsche exists when i look at
 

9409
02:38:06,640 --> 02:38:08,950
where that porsche exists when i look at
it i turn my headset and i look at it

9410
02:38:08,950 --> 02:38:08,960
it i turn my headset and i look at it
 

9411
02:38:08,960 --> 02:38:09,750
it i turn my headset and i look at it
and

9412
02:38:09,750 --> 02:38:09,760
and
 

9413
02:38:09,760 --> 02:38:11,750
and
and then if joe turns his headset in the

9414
02:38:11,750 --> 02:38:11,760
and then if joe turns his headset in the
 

9415
02:38:11,760 --> 02:38:13,670
and then if joe turns his headset in the
right way he'll see his porsche it's not

9416
02:38:13,670 --> 02:38:13,680
right way he'll see his porsche it's not
 

9417
02:38:13,680 --> 02:38:14,870
right way he'll see his porsche it's not
it's not even the same portion that i

9418
02:38:14,870 --> 02:38:14,880
it's not even the same portion that i
 

9419
02:38:14,880 --> 02:38:17,750
it's not even the same portion that i
see he's creating his own porsche

9420
02:38:17,750 --> 02:38:17,760
see he's creating his own porsche
 

9421
02:38:17,760 --> 02:38:19,590
see he's creating his own porsche
so these things are exceedingly

9422
02:38:19,590 --> 02:38:19,600
so these things are exceedingly
 

9423
02:38:19,600 --> 02:38:22,150
so these things are exceedingly
ephemeral and and now

9424
02:38:22,150 --> 02:38:22,160
ephemeral and and now
 

9425
02:38:22,160 --> 02:38:23,270
ephemeral and and now
just imagine

9426
02:38:23,270 --> 02:38:23,280
just imagine
 

9427
02:38:23,280 --> 02:38:27,429
just imagine
saying that that's my porsche well

9428
02:38:27,429 --> 02:38:27,439
saying that that's my porsche well
 

9429
02:38:27,439 --> 02:38:28,870
saying that that's my porsche well
you can agree to say that it's your

9430
02:38:28,870 --> 02:38:28,880
you can agree to say that it's your
 

9431
02:38:28,880 --> 02:38:30,550
you can agree to say that it's your
portion but but really the porsche only

9432
02:38:30,550 --> 02:38:30,560
portion but but really the porsche only
 

9433
02:38:30,560 --> 02:38:31,830
portion but but really the porsche only
exists as long as you

9434
02:38:31,830 --> 02:38:31,840
exists as long as you
 

9435
02:38:31,840 --> 02:38:32,710
exists as long as you
look

9436
02:38:32,710 --> 02:38:32,720
look
 

9437
02:38:32,720 --> 02:38:34,710
look
so so this all of a sudden what the

9438
02:38:34,710 --> 02:38:34,720
so so this all of a sudden what the
 

9439
02:38:34,720 --> 02:38:36,469
so so this all of a sudden what the
spiritual traditions have been saying

9440
02:38:36,469 --> 02:38:36,479
spiritual traditions have been saying
 

9441
02:38:36,479 --> 02:38:38,790
spiritual traditions have been saying
for a long long time this gets cashed

9442
02:38:38,790 --> 02:38:38,800
for a long long time this gets cashed
 

9443
02:38:38,800 --> 02:38:41,190
for a long long time this gets cashed
out in in mathematically precise science

9444
02:38:41,190 --> 02:38:41,200
out in in mathematically precise science
 

9445
02:38:41,200 --> 02:38:44,150
out in in mathematically precise science
it's saying in femoral yes in fact it

9446
02:38:44,150 --> 02:38:44,160
it's saying in femoral yes in fact it
 

9447
02:38:44,160 --> 02:38:45,910
it's saying in femoral yes in fact it
lasts for a few milliseconds a few

9448
02:38:45,910 --> 02:38:45,920
lasts for a few milliseconds a few
 

9449
02:38:45,920 --> 02:38:47,190
lasts for a few milliseconds a few
hundred milliseconds while you look at

9450
02:38:47,190 --> 02:38:47,200
hundred milliseconds while you look at
 

9451
02:38:47,200 --> 02:38:50,630
hundred milliseconds while you look at
it and then it's gone so so the whole

9452

02:38:53,280 --> 02:38:58,150

why are we fighting why do we hate it's

9456
02:38:58,150 --> 02:38:58,160
why are we fighting why do we hate it's
 

9457

why are we fighting why do we hate it's
we fight over possessions

9458
02:39:01,510 --> 02:39:01,520
we fight over possessions
 

9459
02:39:01,520 --> 02:39:03,510
we fight over possessions
because we we think that we're small

9460
02:39:03,510 --> 02:39:03,520
because we we think that we're small
 

9461

because we we think that we're small
little objects

9462

little objects
 

9463
02:39:05,040 --> 02:39:06,550
little objects
inside this

9464
02:39:06,550 --> 02:39:06,560
inside this
 

9465
02:39:06,560 --> 02:39:08,150
inside this
pre-existing space time we assume that

9466
02:39:08,150 --> 02:39:08,160
pre-existing space time we assume that
 

9467
02:39:08,160 --> 02:39:11,110
pre-existing space time we assume that
that that mansion and that car

9468

02:39:17,990 --> 02:39:18,000
sense of
 

9477
02:39:18,000 --> 02:39:20,150
sense of
self and importance enhanced by having

02:39:20,150 --> 02:39:20,160
self and importance enhanced by having
 

9479

02:39:24,960 --> 02:39:26,870
when in fact
is just the opposite

02:39:26,870 --> 02:39:26,880
is just the opposite
 

9487
02:39:26,880 --> 02:39:28,389
is just the opposite
you create that mansion every time you

9488
02:39:28,389 --> 02:39:28,399
you create that mansion every time you
 

9489
02:39:28,399 --> 02:39:29,349
you create that mansion every time you
look

9490
02:39:29,349 --> 02:39:29,359
look
 

9491
02:39:29,359 --> 02:39:30,389
look
that's that's

9492
02:39:30,389 --> 02:39:30,399
that's that's
 

9493
02:39:30,399 --> 02:39:32,150
that's that's
you're the you're something far deeper

9494
02:39:32,150 --> 02:39:32,160
you're the you're something far deeper
 

9495
02:39:32,160 --> 02:39:33,910
you're the you're something far deeper
than that mansion you're the

9496
02:39:33,910 --> 02:39:33,920
than that mansion you're the
 

9497
02:39:33,920 --> 02:39:35,990
than that mansion you're the
entity which can create that mansion on

9498
02:39:35,990 --> 02:39:36,000
entity which can create that mansion on
 

9499
02:39:36,000 --> 02:39:38,469
entity which can create that mansion on
the fly and there's nothing there

9500
02:39:38,469 --> 02:39:38,479
the fly and there's nothing there
 

9501
02:39:38,479 --> 02:39:39,910
the fly and there's nothing there
there's nothing to the mansion except

9502
02:39:39,910 --> 02:39:39,920
there's nothing to the mansion except
 

9503
02:39:39,920 --> 02:39:42,230
there's nothing to the mansion except
what you create in this moment so all so

9504
02:39:42,230 --> 02:39:42,240
what you create in this moment so all so
 

9505
02:39:42,240 --> 02:39:43,670
what you create in this moment so all so
all of a sudden

9506
02:39:43,670 --> 02:39:43,680
all of a sudden
 

9507
02:39:43,680 --> 02:39:46,630
all of a sudden
when you take this point of view

9508
02:39:46,630 --> 02:39:46,640
when you take this point of view
 

9509
02:39:46,640 --> 02:39:49,429
when you take this point of view
it has all sorts of implications

9510
02:39:49,429 --> 02:39:49,439
it has all sorts of implications
 

9511
02:39:49,439 --> 02:39:51,910
it has all sorts of implications
for how we interact with each other how

9512
02:39:51,910 --> 02:39:51,920
for how we interact with each other how
 

9513
02:39:51,920 --> 02:39:53,990
for how we interact with each other how
how we treat each other

9514
02:39:53,990 --> 02:39:54,000
how we treat each other
 

9515
02:39:54,000 --> 02:39:57,110
how we treat each other
um

9516
02:39:57,110 --> 02:39:57,120

 

9517
02:39:57,120 --> 02:39:59,429

and again a lot of things that spiritual

9518
02:39:59,429 --> 02:39:59,439
and again a lot of things that spiritual
 

9519
02:39:59,439 --> 02:40:01,590
and again a lot of things that spiritual
traditions have said

9520
02:40:01,590 --> 02:40:01,600
traditions have said
 

9521
02:40:01,600 --> 02:40:03,030
traditions have said
it's a mixed bag spiritual traditions

9522
02:40:03,030 --> 02:40:03,040
it's a mixed bag spiritual traditions
 

9523
02:40:03,040 --> 02:40:04,309
it's a mixed bag spiritual traditions
are a mixed bag so let me just be right

9524
02:40:04,309 --> 02:40:04,319
are a mixed bag so let me just be right
 

9525
02:40:04,319 --> 02:40:05,910
are a mixed bag so let me just be right
up front about that i'm not promoting

9526
02:40:05,910 --> 02:40:05,920
up front about that i'm not promoting
 

9527
02:40:05,920 --> 02:40:07,429
up front about that i'm not promoting
any particular but they do have some

9528
02:40:07,429 --> 02:40:07,439
any particular but they do have some
 

9529
02:40:07,439 --> 02:40:09,670
any particular but they do have some
insights yeah they have wisdom they have

9530
02:40:09,670 --> 02:40:09,680
insights yeah they have wisdom they have
 

9531
02:40:09,680 --> 02:40:11,590
insights yeah they have wisdom they have
certain wisdom they have i can point to

9532
02:40:11,590 --> 02:40:11,600
certain wisdom they have i can point to
 

9533
02:40:11,600 --> 02:40:12,950
certain wisdom they have i can point to
nonsense i won't go into it but i can

9534
02:40:12,950 --> 02:40:12,960
nonsense i won't go into it but i can
 

9535
02:40:12,960 --> 02:40:15,269
nonsense i won't go into it but i can
also point to lots of nonsense so so the

9536
02:40:15,269 --> 02:40:15,279
also point to lots of nonsense so so the
 

9537
02:40:15,279 --> 02:40:18,389
also point to lots of nonsense so so the
the issue is to then to look for the key

9538
02:40:18,389 --> 02:40:18,399
the issue is to then to look for the key
 

9539
02:40:18,399 --> 02:40:19,750
the issue is to then to look for the key
the key insights and they i think they

9540
02:40:19,750 --> 02:40:19,760
the key insights and they i think they
 

9541
02:40:19,760 --> 02:40:20,550
the key insights and they i think they
have

9542
02:40:20,550 --> 02:40:20,560
have
 

9543
02:40:20,560 --> 02:40:22,469
have
a lot of insights about

9544
02:40:22,469 --> 02:40:22,479
a lot of insights about
 

9545
02:40:22,479 --> 02:40:24,630
a lot of insights about
the ephemeral nature of of objects in

9546
02:40:24,630 --> 02:40:24,640
the ephemeral nature of of objects in
 

9547
02:40:24,640 --> 02:40:26,389
the ephemeral nature of of objects in
space and time and not being attached to

9548
02:40:26,389 --> 02:40:26,399
space and time and not being attached to
 

9549
02:40:26,399 --> 02:40:28,630
space and time and not being attached to
them including our own bodies

9550
02:40:28,630 --> 02:40:28,640
them including our own bodies
 

9551
02:40:28,640 --> 02:40:30,790
them including our own bodies
and reversing that i'm not this little

9552
02:40:30,790 --> 02:40:30,800
and reversing that i'm not this little
 

9553
02:40:30,800 --> 02:40:31,510
and reversing that i'm not this little
thing

9554
02:40:31,510 --> 02:40:31,520
thing
 

9555
02:40:31,520 --> 02:40:32,710
thing
a little consciousness trapped in the

9556
02:40:32,710 --> 02:40:32,720
a little consciousness trapped in the
 

9557
02:40:32,720 --> 02:40:34,870
a little consciousness trapped in the
body and the consciousness itself is

9558
02:40:34,870 --> 02:40:34,880
body and the consciousness itself is
 

9559
02:40:34,880 --> 02:40:36,230
body and the consciousness itself is
only a product of the body so when the

9560
02:40:36,230 --> 02:40:36,240
only a product of the body so when the
 

9561
02:40:36,240 --> 02:40:39,030
only a product of the body so when the
body dies the consciousness disappears

9562
02:40:39,030 --> 02:40:39,040
body dies the consciousness disappears
 

9563
02:40:39,040 --> 02:40:40,630
body dies the consciousness disappears
it turns completely around the

9564
02:40:40,630 --> 02:40:40,640
it turns completely around the
 

9565
02:40:40,640 --> 02:40:44,630
it turns completely around the
consciousness is fundamental the body

9566
02:40:44,630 --> 02:40:44,640
consciousness is fundamental the body

02:41:27,670 --> 02:41:27,680
unlike the spiritual traditions which
 

9617
02:41:27,680 --> 02:41:28,630
unlike the spiritual traditions which
have said

9618
02:41:28,630 --> 02:41:28,640
have said
 

9619
02:41:28,640 --> 02:41:30,469
have said
in some cases similar things

9620
02:41:30,469 --> 02:41:30,479
in some cases similar things
 

9621
02:41:30,479 --> 02:41:33,030
in some cases similar things
they set it in precisely

9622
02:41:33,030 --> 02:41:33,040
they set it in precisely
 

9623
02:41:33,040 --> 02:41:34,710
they set it in precisely
this is mathematics

9624
02:41:34,710 --> 02:41:34,720
this is mathematics
 

9625
02:41:34,720 --> 02:41:37,110
this is mathematics
we can actually now begin to stay

9626
02:41:37,110 --> 02:41:37,120
we can actually now begin to stay

02:41:37,120 --> 02:41:39,269
we can actually now begin to stay
precisely here's the mathematical model

9628
02:41:39,269 --> 02:41:39,279
precisely here's the mathematical model
 

9629
02:41:39,279 --> 02:41:41,269
precisely here's the mathematical model
of consciousness conscious agents here's

how it maps onto spacetime which i
 

9633
02:41:42,560 --> 02:41:43,269
how it maps onto spacetime which i
should

9634
02:41:43,269 --> 02:41:43,279
should
 

9635
02:41:43,279 --> 02:41:45,590
should
sketch really briefly

9636
02:41:45,590 --> 02:41:45,600
sketch really briefly
 

9637
02:41:45,600 --> 02:41:48,790
sketch really briefly
and here's why

9638
02:41:48,790 --> 02:41:48,800

 

9639
02:41:48,800 --> 02:41:50,230

things are ephemeral

9640
02:41:50,230 --> 02:41:50,240
things are ephemeral
 

9641
02:41:50,240 --> 02:41:52,550
things are ephemeral
and here's why you shouldn't be worried

9642
02:41:52,550 --> 02:41:52,560
and here's why you shouldn't be worried
 

9643
02:41:52,560 --> 02:41:53,990
and here's why you shouldn't be worried
about the ephemeral nature of things

9644
02:41:53,990 --> 02:41:54,000
about the ephemeral nature of things
 

9645
02:41:54,000 --> 02:41:54,870
about the ephemeral nature of things
because

9646
02:41:54,870 --> 02:41:54,880
because
 

9647
02:41:54,880 --> 02:41:57,590
because
you're not a little tiny entity inside

9648
02:41:57,590 --> 02:41:57,600
you're not a little tiny entity inside
 

9649
02:41:57,600 --> 02:41:59,030
you're not a little tiny entity inside
space and time

9650
02:41:59,030 --> 02:41:59,040

9651
02:41:59,040 --> 02:42:00,389

quite the opposite you're the author of

9652
02:42:00,389 --> 02:42:00,399
quite the opposite you're the author of
 

9653
02:42:00,399 --> 02:42:02,150
quite the opposite you're the author of

space and time
 

9655
02:42:02,160 --> 02:42:05,190
space and time
the i and the am and the i am is all

9656
02:42:05,190 --> 02:42:05,200
the i and the am and the i am is all
 

9657
02:42:05,200 --> 02:42:06,630
the i and the am and the i am is all
kind of emerging through this whole

9658
02:42:06,630 --> 02:42:06,640
kind of emerging through this whole
 

9659
02:42:06,640 --> 02:42:08,950
kind of emerging through this whole
process of evolution and so on

02:42:08,950 --> 02:42:08,960
process of evolution and so on
 

9661
02:42:08,960 --> 02:42:10,710
process of evolution and so on
that's

9662
02:42:10,710 --> 02:42:10,720
that's
 

9663
02:42:10,720 --> 02:42:12,550
that's
that's just surface waves and there's a

9664
02:42:12,550 --> 02:42:12,560
that's just surface waves and there's a
 

9665
02:42:12,560 --> 02:42:14,550
that's just surface waves and there's a
much deeper ocean that we're trying to

9666
02:42:14,550 --> 02:42:14,560
much deeper ocean that we're trying to
 

9667
02:42:14,560 --> 02:42:16,790
much deeper ocean that we're trying to
figure out here so how does you said

9668
02:42:16,790 --> 02:42:16,800
figure out here so how does you said
 

9669
02:42:16,800 --> 02:42:18,230
figure out here so how does you said
this said this some of the stuff you're

9670
02:42:18,230 --> 02:42:18,240
this said this some of the stuff you're
 

9671
02:42:18,240 --> 02:42:19,830
this said this some of the stuff you're
thinking about maps the space time how

9672
02:42:19,830 --> 02:42:19,840
thinking about maps the space time how
 

9673
02:42:19,840 --> 02:42:22,309
thinking about maps the space time how
does it map the space right so so just a

9674
02:42:22,309 --> 02:42:22,319
does it map the space right so so just a
 

9675
02:42:22,319 --> 02:42:23,910
does it map the space right so so just a
very very high level and i'll keep it

9676
02:42:23,910 --> 02:42:23,920
very very high level and i'll keep it
 

9677
02:42:23,920 --> 02:42:25,110
very very high level and i'll keep it
brief

9678
02:42:25,110 --> 02:42:25,120
brief
 

9679
02:42:25,120 --> 02:42:26,790
brief
the structures that the physicists are

9680
02:42:26,790 --> 02:42:26,800
the structures that the physicists are
 

9681
02:42:26,800 --> 02:42:27,910
the structures that the physicists are
finding

9682
02:42:27,910 --> 02:42:27,920
finding
 

9683
02:42:27,920 --> 02:42:29,830
finding
like the amplitude

9684
02:42:29,830 --> 02:42:29,840
like the amplitude
 

9685
02:42:29,840 --> 02:42:31,590
like the amplitude
it turns out they're just static

9686
02:42:31,590 --> 02:42:31,600
it turns out they're just static
 

9687
02:42:31,600 --> 02:42:34,309
it turns out they're just static
structure they're polytopes

9688
02:42:34,309 --> 02:42:34,319
structure they're polytopes
 

9689
02:42:34,319 --> 02:42:35,510
structure they're polytopes
but they

9690
02:42:35,510 --> 02:42:35,520
but they
 

9691
02:42:35,520 --> 02:42:37,510
but they
remarkably most of the information in

9692
02:42:37,510 --> 02:42:37,520
remarkably most of the information in
 

9693
02:42:37,520 --> 02:42:39,590
remarkably most of the information in
them is contained in permutation

9694
02:42:39,590 --> 02:42:39,600
them is contained in permutation
 

9695
02:42:39,600 --> 02:42:42,870
them is contained in permutation
matrices

9696
02:42:42,870 --> 02:42:42,880

 

9697
02:42:42,880 --> 02:42:45,510

so it's a matrix like an n by n matrix

9698
02:42:45,510 --> 02:42:45,520
so it's a matrix like an n by n matrix
 

9699
02:42:45,520 --> 02:42:49,429
so it's a matrix like an n by n matrix
that just has zeros and ones

9700
02:42:49,429 --> 02:42:49,439

 

9701
02:42:49,439 --> 02:42:50,950

that contains almost all of the

9702
02:42:50,950 --> 02:42:50,960
that contains almost all of the
 

9703
02:42:50,960 --> 02:42:53,269
that contains almost all of the
information and you can they have these

9704
02:42:53,269 --> 02:42:53,279
information and you can they have these
 

9705
02:42:53,279 --> 02:42:54,950
information and you can they have these
plabic graphs and so forth that they use

9706
02:42:54,950 --> 02:42:54,960
plabic graphs and so forth that they use
 

9707
02:42:54,960 --> 02:42:56,070
plabic graphs and so forth that they use
to boot up

9708
02:42:56,070 --> 02:42:56,080
to boot up
 

9709
02:42:56,080 --> 02:42:57,429
to boot up
the scattering you can compute those

9710
02:42:57,429 --> 02:42:57,439
the scattering you can compute those
 

9711
02:42:57,439 --> 02:42:58,950
the scattering you can compute those
scattering amplitudes

9712
02:42:58,950 --> 02:42:58,960
scattering amplitudes
 

9713
02:42:58,960 --> 02:43:00,870
scattering amplitudes
almost entirely from these

9714
02:43:00,870 --> 02:43:00,880
almost entirely from these
 

9715
02:43:00,880 --> 02:43:03,429
almost entirely from these
permutation matrices

9716
02:43:03,429 --> 02:43:03,439
permutation matrices
 

9717
02:43:03,439 --> 02:43:05,510
permutation matrices
so that's just

9718
02:43:05,510 --> 02:43:05,520
so that's just
 

9719
02:43:05,520 --> 02:43:07,349
so that's just
now from my point of view i have this

9720
02:43:07,349 --> 02:43:07,359
now from my point of view i have this
 

9721
02:43:07,359 --> 02:43:09,269
now from my point of view i have this
conscious agent dynamics

9722
02:43:09,269 --> 02:43:09,279
conscious agent dynamics
 

9723
02:43:09,279 --> 02:43:10,710
conscious agent dynamics
it turns out that the stationary

02:43:10,710 --> 02:43:10,720
it turns out that the stationary
 

9725
02:43:10,720 --> 02:43:11,830
it turns out that the stationary

9727
02:43:11,840 --> 02:43:13,670
dynamics
that i was talking about the the where

9728
02:43:13,670 --> 02:43:13,680
that i was talking about the the where
 

9729
02:43:13,680 --> 02:43:15,830
that i was talking about the the where
the entropy is increasing

9730
02:43:15,830 --> 02:43:15,840
the entropy is increasing
 

9731
02:43:15,840 --> 02:43:18,870
the entropy is increasing
all the stationary dynamics are

9732
02:43:18,870 --> 02:43:18,880
all the stationary dynamics are
 

9733
02:43:18,880 --> 02:43:21,030
all the stationary dynamics are
sketched out by

9734
02:43:21,030 --> 02:43:21,040
sketched out by
 

9735
02:43:21,040 --> 02:43:24,150

permutation matrices
 

9737
02:43:24,160 --> 02:43:26,469
permutation matrices
so if you there's so-called burkhoff

9738
02:43:26,469 --> 02:43:26,479
so if you there's so-called burkhoff
 

9739
02:43:26,479 --> 02:43:27,670
so if you there's so-called burkhoff

um

9752
02:43:39,030 --> 02:43:39,040
um
 

9753
02:43:39,040 --> 02:43:41,349

that have the uniform measure as a

little better with what the heck you're

9758
02:43:45,269 --> 02:43:45,279
little better with what the heck you're
 

9759
02:43:45,279 --> 02:43:47,269
little better with what the heck you're
talking about but

talking about but
 

9761
02:43:47,279 --> 02:43:50,309
talking about but
so basically there's some complicated

9762
02:43:50,309 --> 02:43:50,319
so basically there's some complicated
 

9763
02:43:50,319 --> 02:43:52,309
so basically there's some complicated
thing going on with the network of

this

02:43:56,479 --> 02:43:58,469
this
you're saying a two-dimensional matrix

9772

you're saying a two-dimensional matrix
 

9773
02:43:58,479 --> 02:43:59,750
you're saying a two-dimensional matrix
that uh

that uh
 

9775
02:43:59,760 --> 02:44:02,070
that uh
uh scattering has to do with what with

uh scattering has to do with what with
 

9777
02:44:02,080 --> 02:44:04,550
uh scattering has to do with what with
our perception like that's like photon

our perception like that's like photon
 

9779
02:44:04,560 --> 02:44:05,990
our perception like that's like photon
stuff or i mean i don't know if it's

9780
02:44:05,990 --> 02:44:06,000
stuff or i mean i don't know if it's
 

9781
02:44:06,000 --> 02:44:07,590
stuff or i mean i don't know if it's
useful to sort of

9782
02:44:07,590 --> 02:44:07,600
useful to sort of
 

9783
02:44:07,600 --> 02:44:10,389
useful to sort of
uh dig into detail i'll do just a high

9784
02:44:10,389 --> 02:44:10,399
uh dig into detail i'll do just a high
 

9785
02:44:10,399 --> 02:44:11,830
uh dig into detail i'll do just a high
level thing yes

9786
02:44:11,830 --> 02:44:11,840
level thing yes
 

9787
02:44:11,840 --> 02:44:14,389
level thing yes
so the the the high level is the

9788
02:44:14,389 --> 02:44:14,399
so the the the high level is the
 

9789
02:44:14,399 --> 02:44:15,910
so the the the high level is the
long-term behavior of the conscious

9790
02:44:15,910 --> 02:44:15,920
long-term behavior of the conscious
 

9791
02:44:15,920 --> 02:44:17,190
long-term behavior of the conscious
agent that makes so that's the

9792
02:44:17,190 --> 02:44:17,200
agent that makes so that's the
 

9793
02:44:17,200 --> 02:44:18,550
agent that makes so that's the
projection of just looking at the

9794
02:44:18,550 --> 02:44:18,560
projection of just looking at the
 

9795
02:44:18,560 --> 02:44:20,550
projection of just looking at the
long-term behavior

9796
02:44:20,550 --> 02:44:20,560
long-term behavior
 

9797
02:44:20,560 --> 02:44:21,990
long-term behavior
i'm hoping will give rise to the

9798
02:44:21,990 --> 02:44:22,000
i'm hoping will give rise to the
 

9799
02:44:22,000 --> 02:44:23,590
i'm hoping will give rise to the
amplitude

9800
02:44:23,590 --> 02:44:23,600
amplitude
 

9801
02:44:23,600 --> 02:44:25,429
amplitude
the amplitude

9802
02:44:25,429 --> 02:44:25,439
the amplitude
 

9803
02:44:25,439 --> 02:44:27,590
the amplitude
then gives rise to space-time

9804
02:44:27,590 --> 02:44:27,600
then gives rise to space-time
 

9805
02:44:27,600 --> 02:44:29,990
then gives rise to space-time
so then i can just use their link to go

9806
02:44:29,990 --> 02:44:30,000
so then i can just use their link to go
 

9807
02:44:30,000 --> 02:44:31,190
so then i can just use their link to go
all the way from consciousness through

9808
02:44:31,190 --> 02:44:31,200
all the way from consciousness through
 

9809
02:44:31,200 --> 02:44:32,630
all the way from consciousness through
its asymptotics

9810
02:44:32,630 --> 02:44:32,640
its asymptotics
 

9811
02:44:32,640 --> 02:44:35,110
its asymptotics
to through the amplitude into space time

9812
02:44:35,110 --> 02:44:35,120
to through the amplitude into space time
 

9813
02:44:35,120 --> 02:44:36,950
to through the amplitude into space time
and get the map all the way

9814
02:44:36,950 --> 02:44:36,960
and get the map all the way
 

9815
02:44:36,960 --> 02:44:38,230
and get the map all the way
into our interface and that's why you

9816
02:44:38,230 --> 02:44:38,240
into our interface and that's why you
 

9817
02:44:38,240 --> 02:44:39,670
into our interface and that's why you
mentioned the permutation majors because

9818
02:44:39,670 --> 02:44:39,680
mentioned the permutation majors because
 

9819
02:44:39,680 --> 02:44:41,590
mentioned the permutation majors because
it gives you a nice thing to to try to

9820
02:44:41,590 --> 02:44:41,600
it gives you a nice thing to to try to
 

9821
02:44:41,600 --> 02:44:42,870
it gives you a nice thing to to try to
generate that's right it's the

9822
02:44:42,870 --> 02:44:42,880
generate that's right it's the
 

9823
02:44:42,880 --> 02:44:44,469
generate that's right it's the
connection with the amplitude the

9824
02:44:44,469 --> 02:44:44,479
connection with the amplitude the
 

9825
02:44:44,479 --> 02:44:46,150
connection with the amplitude the
permutation matrices are the core of the

9826
02:44:46,150 --> 02:44:46,160
permutation matrices are the core of the
 

9827
02:44:46,160 --> 02:44:48,230
permutation matrices are the core of the
amplitude and it turns out they're the

9828
02:44:48,230 --> 02:44:48,240
amplitude and it turns out they're the
 

9829
02:44:48,240 --> 02:44:50,710
amplitude and it turns out they're the
core of the asymptotic description of

9830
02:44:50,710 --> 02:44:50,720
core of the asymptotic description of
 

9831
02:44:50,720 --> 02:44:52,150
core of the asymptotic description of
the conscious agents

9832
02:44:52,150 --> 02:44:52,160
the conscious agents
 

9833
02:44:52,160 --> 02:44:54,070
the conscious agents
so not to sort of bring up the idea of a

9834
02:44:54,070 --> 02:44:54,080
so not to sort of bring up the idea of a
 

9835
02:44:54,080 --> 02:44:56,150
so not to sort of bring up the idea of a
creator but i i like

9836
02:44:56,150 --> 02:44:56,160
creator but i i like
 

9837
02:44:56,160 --> 02:44:57,990
creator but i i like
first of all i like video games and you

9838
02:44:57,990 --> 02:44:58,000
first of all i like video games and you
 

9839
02:44:58,000 --> 02:44:58,950
first of all i like video games and you
mentioned

9840
02:44:58,950 --> 02:44:58,960
mentioned
 

9841
02:44:58,960 --> 02:45:01,190
mentioned
this kind of simulation idea first of

9842
02:45:01,190 --> 02:45:01,200
this kind of simulation idea first of
 

9843
02:45:01,200 --> 02:45:02,630
this kind of simulation idea first of
all do you think of as an interesting

9844
02:45:02,630 --> 02:45:02,640
all do you think of as an interesting
 

9845
02:45:02,640 --> 02:45:04,230
all do you think of as an interesting
idea this thought experiment that will

9846
02:45:04,230 --> 02:45:04,240
idea this thought experiment that will
 

9847
02:45:04,240 --> 02:45:06,550
idea this thought experiment that will
live in a simulation

9848
02:45:06,550 --> 02:45:06,560
live in a simulation
 

9849
02:45:06,560 --> 02:45:08,389
live in a simulation
and in general do you think we live in a

9850
02:45:08,389 --> 02:45:08,399
and in general do you think we live in a
 

9851
02:45:08,399 --> 02:45:10,230
and in general do you think we live in a
simulation

9852
02:45:10,230 --> 02:45:10,240
simulation
 

9853
02:45:10,240 --> 02:45:12,950
simulation
so the nick bostrom's idea about the

9854
02:45:12,950 --> 02:45:12,960
so the nick bostrom's idea about the
 

9855
02:45:12,960 --> 02:45:16,150
so the nick bostrom's idea about the
simulation is typically

9856
02:45:16,150 --> 02:45:16,160
simulation is typically
 

9857
02:45:16,160 --> 02:45:18,710
simulation is typically
couched in a physicalist framework yes

9858
02:45:18,710 --> 02:45:18,720
couched in a physicalist framework yes
 

9859
02:45:18,720 --> 02:45:20,790
couched in a physicalist framework yes
so there's the bottom level

9860
02:45:20,790 --> 02:45:20,800
so there's the bottom level
 

9861
02:45:20,800 --> 02:45:22,950
so there's the bottom level
there's some programmer in this physical

9862
02:45:22,950 --> 02:45:22,960
there's some programmer in this physical
 

9863
02:45:22,960 --> 02:45:25,030
there's some programmer in this physical
spacetime and they have a computer that

9864
02:45:25,030 --> 02:45:25,040
spacetime and they have a computer that
 

9865
02:45:25,040 --> 02:45:27,190
spacetime and they have a computer that
they've programmed really cleverly where

9866
02:45:27,190 --> 02:45:27,200
they've programmed really cleverly where
 

9867
02:45:27,200 --> 02:45:28,550
they've programmed really cleverly where
they've created

9868
02:45:28,550 --> 02:45:28,560
they've created
 

9869
02:45:28,560 --> 02:45:30,469
they've created
conscious entities

9870
02:45:30,469 --> 02:45:30,479
conscious entities
 

9871
02:45:30,479 --> 02:45:31,590
conscious entities
so you have the hard problem of

9872
02:45:31,590 --> 02:45:31,600
so you have the hard problem of
 

9873
02:45:31,600 --> 02:45:33,190
so you have the hard problem of
consciousness right the standard hard

9874
02:45:33,190 --> 02:45:33,200
consciousness right the standard hard
 

9875
02:45:33,200 --> 02:45:35,269
consciousness right the standard hard
problem how could a computer simulation

9876
02:45:35,269 --> 02:45:35,279
problem how could a computer simulation
 

9877
02:45:35,279 --> 02:45:36,469
problem how could a computer simulation
create a constant

9878
02:45:36,469 --> 02:45:36,479
create a constant
 

9879
02:45:36,479 --> 02:45:38,230
create a constant
which isn't explained by that simulation

9880
02:45:38,230 --> 02:45:38,240
which isn't explained by that simulation
 

9881
02:45:38,240 --> 02:45:40,150
which isn't explained by that simulation
theory but then the idea is that the

9882
02:45:40,150 --> 02:45:40,160
theory but then the idea is that the
 

9883
02:45:40,160 --> 02:45:43,110
theory but then the idea is that the
next level the the entities that are

9884
02:45:43,110 --> 02:45:43,120
next level the the entities that are
 

9885
02:45:43,120 --> 02:45:43,990
next level the the entities that are
from the

9886
02:45:43,990 --> 02:45:44,000
from the
 

9887
02:45:44,000 --> 02:45:45,110
from the
that are

9888
02:45:45,110 --> 02:45:45,120
that are
 

9889
02:45:45,120 --> 02:45:46,469
that are
created in the first level simulation

9890
02:45:46,469 --> 02:45:46,479
created in the first level simulation
 

9891
02:45:46,479 --> 02:45:47,990
created in the first level simulation
then can write their own simulations and

9892
02:45:47,990 --> 02:45:48,000
then can write their own simulations and
 

9893
02:45:48,000 --> 02:45:50,309
then can write their own simulations and
you get this this nesting

9894
02:45:50,309 --> 02:45:50,319
you get this this nesting
 

9895
02:45:50,319 --> 02:45:51,190
you get this this nesting
so

9896
02:45:51,190 --> 02:45:51,200
so
 

9897
02:45:51,200 --> 02:45:54,150
so
so the idea that um this is a simulation

9898
02:45:54,150 --> 02:45:54,160
so the idea that um this is a simulation
 

9899
02:45:54,160 --> 02:45:55,510
so the idea that um this is a simulation
is fine

9900
02:45:55,510 --> 02:45:55,520
is fine
 

9901
02:45:55,520 --> 02:45:57,429
is fine
but the idea that this starts with a

9902
02:45:57,429 --> 02:45:57,439
but the idea that this starts with a
 

9903
02:45:57,439 --> 02:45:59,510
but the idea that this starts with a
physical space i think

9904
02:45:59,510 --> 02:45:59,520
physical space i think
 

9905
02:45:59,520 --> 02:46:01,030
physical space i think
isn't but there's there's different

9906
02:46:01,030 --> 02:46:01,040
isn't but there's there's different
 

9907
02:46:01,040 --> 02:46:02,550
isn't but there's there's different
properties here the the partial

9908
02:46:02,550 --> 02:46:02,560
properties here the the partial
 

9909
02:46:02,560 --> 02:46:05,030
properties here the the partial
rendering and to me that's

9910
02:46:05,030 --> 02:46:05,040
rendering and to me that's
 

9911
02:46:05,040 --> 02:46:07,030
rendering and to me that's
the interesting idea

9912
02:46:07,030 --> 02:46:07,040
the interesting idea
 

9913
02:46:07,040 --> 02:46:08,630
the interesting idea
is not whether the entirety of the

9914
02:46:08,630 --> 02:46:08,640
is not whether the entirety of the
 

9915
02:46:08,640 --> 02:46:12,150
is not whether the entirety of the
universe is simulated but how

9916
02:46:12,150 --> 02:46:12,160
universe is simulated but how
 

9917
02:46:12,160 --> 02:46:16,389
universe is simulated but how
efficiently can you

9918
02:46:16,389 --> 02:46:16,399

 

9919
02:46:16,399 --> 02:46:19,190

create interfaces that are convincing to

9920
02:46:19,190 --> 02:46:19,200
create interfaces that are convincing to
 

9921
02:46:19,200 --> 02:46:20,950
create interfaces that are convincing to
all

9922
02:46:20,950 --> 02:46:20,960
all
 

9923
02:46:20,960 --> 02:46:22,830
all
other entities that can appreciate such

9924
02:46:22,830 --> 02:46:22,840
other entities that can appreciate such
 

9925
02:46:22,840 --> 02:46:25,750
other entities that can appreciate such
interfaces how little does it take

9926
02:46:25,750 --> 02:46:25,760
interfaces how little does it take
 

9927
02:46:25,760 --> 02:46:27,750
interfaces how little does it take
because you said like partial rendering

9928
02:46:27,750 --> 02:46:27,760
because you said like partial rendering
 

9929
02:46:27,760 --> 02:46:29,510
because you said like partial rendering
or like temporal

9930
02:46:29,510 --> 02:46:29,520
or like temporal
 

9931
02:46:29,520 --> 02:46:31,670
or like temporal
affirmative rendering of stuff

9932
02:46:31,670 --> 02:46:31,680
affirmative rendering of stuff
 

9933
02:46:31,680 --> 02:46:33,349
affirmative rendering of stuff
only render the tree falling in the

9934
02:46:33,349 --> 02:46:33,359
only render the tree falling in the
 

9935
02:46:33,359 --> 02:46:35,110
only render the tree falling in the
forest when there's somebody there to

9936
02:46:35,110 --> 02:46:35,120
forest when there's somebody there to
 

9937
02:46:35,120 --> 02:46:36,150
forest when there's somebody there to
see it

9938
02:46:36,150 --> 02:46:36,160
see it
 

9939
02:46:36,160 --> 02:46:37,429
see it
it's interesting

9940
02:46:37,429 --> 02:46:37,439
it's interesting
 

9941
02:46:37,439 --> 02:46:39,110
it's interesting
to think how can you do that super

9942
02:46:39,110 --> 02:46:39,120
to think how can you do that super
 

9943
02:46:39,120 --> 02:46:40,710
to think how can you do that super
efficiently without having to render

9944
02:46:40,710 --> 02:46:40,720
efficiently without having to render
 

9945
02:46:40,720 --> 02:46:42,710
efficiently without having to render
everything and that to me is one

9946
02:46:42,710 --> 02:46:42,720
everything and that to me is one
 

9947
02:46:42,720 --> 02:46:44,630
everything and that to me is one
perspective on the simulation just like

9948
02:46:44,630 --> 02:46:44,640
perspective on the simulation just like
 

9949
02:46:44,640 --> 02:46:46,790
perspective on the simulation just like
it is with video games right where a

9950
02:46:46,790 --> 02:46:46,800
it is with video games right where a
 

9951
02:46:46,800 --> 02:46:48,710
it is with video games right where a
video game doesn't have to render every

9952
02:46:48,710 --> 02:46:48,720
video game doesn't have to render every
 

9953
02:46:48,720 --> 02:46:50,230
video game doesn't have to render every
single thing it's just the thing that

9954
02:46:50,230 --> 02:46:50,240
single thing it's just the thing that
 

9955
02:46:50,240 --> 02:46:52,950
single thing it's just the thing that
the observer is looking at right there

9956
02:46:52,950 --> 02:46:52,960
the observer is looking at right there
 

9957
02:46:52,960 --> 02:46:54,550
the observer is looking at right there
is actually that's a

9958
02:46:54,550 --> 02:46:54,560
is actually that's a
 

9959
02:46:54,560 --> 02:46:56,710
is actually that's a
very nice question and there's

9960
02:46:56,710 --> 02:46:56,720
very nice question and there's
 

9961
02:46:56,720 --> 02:46:58,230
very nice question and there's
whole groups of researchers that are

9962
02:46:58,230 --> 02:46:58,240
whole groups of researchers that are
 

9963
02:46:58,240 --> 02:47:00,710
whole groups of researchers that are
actually studying in virtual reality

9964
02:47:00,710 --> 02:47:00,720
actually studying in virtual reality
 

9965
02:47:00,720 --> 02:47:01,830
actually studying in virtual reality
what

9966
02:47:01,830 --> 02:47:01,840
what
 

9967
02:47:01,840 --> 02:47:04,469
what
what is the sort of minimal

9968
02:47:04,469 --> 02:47:04,479
what is the sort of minimal
 

9969
02:47:04,479 --> 02:47:06,389
what is the sort of minimal
requirements on this system what how

9970
02:47:06,389 --> 02:47:06,399
requirements on this system what how
 

9971
02:47:06,399 --> 02:47:08,309
requirements on this system what how
does it have to operate to give you an

9972
02:47:08,309 --> 02:47:08,319
does it have to operate to give you an
 

9973
02:47:08,319 --> 02:47:10,870
does it have to operate to give you an
immersion experience to give you the

9974
02:47:10,870 --> 02:47:10,880
immersion experience to give you the
 

9975
02:47:10,880 --> 02:47:13,269
immersion experience to give you the
feeling that you have a body to to get

9976
02:47:13,269 --> 02:47:13,279
feeling that you have a body to to get
 

9977
02:47:13,279 --> 02:47:14,950
feeling that you have a body to to get
you to take it real and there's actually

9978
02:47:14,950 --> 02:47:14,960
you to take it real and there's actually
 

9979
02:47:14,960 --> 02:47:16,230
you to take it real and there's actually
a lot of really good work on that right

9980
02:47:16,230 --> 02:47:16,240
a lot of really good work on that right
 

9981
02:47:16,240 --> 02:47:17,670
a lot of really good work on that right
now and it turns out it doesn't take

9982
02:47:17,670 --> 02:47:17,680
now and it turns out it doesn't take
 

9983
02:47:17,680 --> 02:47:19,349
now and it turns out it doesn't take
that much you do need to get the

9984
02:47:19,349 --> 02:47:19,359
that much you do need to get the
 

9985
02:47:19,359 --> 02:47:21,110
that much you do need to get the
perception action loop

9986
02:47:21,110 --> 02:47:21,120
perception action loop
 

9987
02:47:21,120 --> 02:47:22,309
perception action loop
tight and and

9988
02:47:22,309 --> 02:47:22,319
tight and and
 

9989
02:47:22,319 --> 02:47:23,750
tight and and
you have to

9990
02:47:23,750 --> 02:47:23,760
you have to
 

9991
02:47:23,760 --> 02:47:25,269
you have to
give them the perceptions that they're

9992
02:47:25,269 --> 02:47:25,279
give them the perceptions that they're
 

9993
02:47:25,279 --> 02:47:27,510
give them the perceptions that they're
expecting if you want them to but if you

9994
02:47:27,510 --> 02:47:27,520
expecting if you want them to but if you
 

9995
02:47:27,520 --> 02:47:29,110
expecting if you want them to but if you
you you can

9996
02:47:29,110 --> 02:47:29,120
you you can
 

9997
02:47:29,120 --> 02:47:30,550
you you can
lead them along if you give them

9998
02:47:30,550 --> 02:47:30,560
lead them along if you give them
 

9999
02:47:30,560 --> 02:47:31,590
lead them along if you give them
perceptions that are close to what

10000
02:47:31,590 --> 02:47:31,600
perceptions that are close to what
 

10001
02:47:31,600 --> 02:47:33,510
perceptions that are close to what
they're expecting you can then maybe

10002
02:47:33,510 --> 02:47:33,520
they're expecting you can then maybe
 

10003
02:47:33,520 --> 02:47:35,590
they're expecting you can then maybe
move their reality around a bit yeah

10004
02:47:35,590 --> 02:47:35,600
move their reality around a bit yeah
 

10005
02:47:35,600 --> 02:47:36,790
move their reality around a bit yeah
it's a tricky engineering problem

10006
02:47:36,790 --> 02:47:36,800
it's a tricky engineering problem
 

10007
02:47:36,800 --> 02:47:37,910
it's a tricky engineering problem
especially when you're trying to create

10008
02:47:37,910 --> 02:47:37,920
especially when you're trying to create
 

10009
02:47:37,920 --> 02:47:39,190
especially when you're trying to create
a product

10010
02:47:39,190 --> 02:47:39,200
a product
 

10011
02:47:39,200 --> 02:47:41,750
a product
that costs little but that's i it feels

10012
02:47:41,750 --> 02:47:41,760
that costs little but that's i it feels
 

10013
02:47:41,760 --> 02:47:43,429
that costs little but that's i it feels
like an engineering problem not a deeply

10014
02:47:43,429 --> 02:47:43,439
like an engineering problem not a deeply
 

10015
02:47:43,439 --> 02:47:45,830
like an engineering problem not a deeply
scientific problem

10016
02:47:45,830 --> 02:47:45,840
scientific problem
 

10017
02:47:45,840 --> 02:47:47,269
scientific problem
or meaning obviously it's a scientific

10018
02:47:47,269 --> 02:47:47,279
or meaning obviously it's a scientific
 

10019
02:47:47,279 --> 02:47:49,110
or meaning obviously it's a scientific
problem but as a scientific problem it's

10020
02:47:49,110 --> 02:47:49,120
problem but as a scientific problem it's
 

10021
02:47:49,120 --> 02:47:51,349
problem but as a scientific problem it's
not that difficult to trick us

10022
02:47:51,349 --> 02:47:51,359
not that difficult to trick us
 

10023
02:47:51,359 --> 02:47:53,750
not that difficult to trick us
uh descendants of apes but here's here's

10024
02:47:53,750 --> 02:47:53,760
uh descendants of apes but here's here's
 

10025
02:47:53,760 --> 02:47:54,550
uh descendants of apes but here's here's
a

10026
02:47:54,550 --> 02:47:54,560
a
 

10027
02:47:54,560 --> 02:47:56,630
a
case for just us you know our own this

10028
02:47:56,630 --> 02:47:56,640
case for just us you know our own this
 

10029
02:47:56,640 --> 02:47:57,590
case for just us you know our own this
is a virtual reality that we're

10030
02:47:57,590 --> 02:47:57,600
is a virtual reality that we're
 

10031
02:47:57,600 --> 02:47:59,190
is a virtual reality that we're
experiencing right now so

10032
02:47:59,190 --> 02:47:59,200
experiencing right now so
 

10033
02:47:59,200 --> 02:48:00,230
experiencing right now so
here's something you can try for

10034
02:48:00,230 --> 02:48:00,240
here's something you can try for
 

10035
02:48:00,240 --> 02:48:01,510
here's something you can try for
yourself

10036
02:48:01,510 --> 02:48:01,520
yourself
 

10037
02:48:01,520 --> 02:48:04,469
yourself
if you just close your eyes

10038
02:48:04,469 --> 02:48:04,479
if you just close your eyes
 

10039
02:48:04,479 --> 02:48:06,710
if you just close your eyes
and look at

10040
02:48:06,710 --> 02:48:06,720
and look at
 

10041
02:48:06,720 --> 02:48:08,710
and look at
your experience in front of you to be

10042
02:48:08,710 --> 02:48:08,720
your experience in front of you to be
 

10043
02:48:08,720 --> 02:48:09,750
your experience in front of you to be
aware of your experience in front of you

10044
02:48:09,750 --> 02:48:09,760
aware of your experience in front of you
 

10045
02:48:09,760 --> 02:48:11,429
aware of your experience in front of you
what you experience is just like a

10046
02:48:11,429 --> 02:48:11,439
what you experience is just like a
 

10047
02:48:11,439 --> 02:48:12,630
what you experience is just like a
modeled

10048
02:48:12,630 --> 02:48:12,640
modeled
 

10049
02:48:12,640 --> 02:48:14,870
modeled
dark gray but there's all sort of

10050
02:48:14,870 --> 02:48:14,880
dark gray but there's all sort of
 

10051
02:48:14,880 --> 02:48:15,990
dark gray but there's all sort of
there's some dynamics to it but it's

10052
02:48:15,990 --> 02:48:16,000
there's some dynamics to it but it's
 

10053
02:48:16,000 --> 02:48:17,429
there's some dynamics to it but it's
just dark gray

10054
02:48:17,429 --> 02:48:17,439
just dark gray
 

10055
02:48:17,439 --> 02:48:19,110
just dark gray
but now i ask you

10056
02:48:19,110 --> 02:48:19,120
but now i ask you
 

10057
02:48:19,120 --> 02:48:20,950
but now i ask you
instead of having your attention

10058
02:48:20,950 --> 02:48:20,960
instead of having your attention
 

10059
02:48:20,960 --> 02:48:22,469
instead of having your attention
forward

10060
02:48:22,469 --> 02:48:22,479
forward
 

10061
02:48:22,479 --> 02:48:24,550
forward
put your attention backward what is it

10062
02:48:24,550 --> 02:48:24,560
put your attention backward what is it
 

10063
02:48:24,560 --> 02:48:29,590
put your attention backward what is it
like behind you with your eyes closed

10064
02:48:29,590 --> 02:48:29,600

 

10065
02:48:29,600 --> 02:48:30,870

and there

10066
02:48:30,870 --> 02:48:30,880
and there
 

10067
02:48:30,880 --> 02:48:31,910
and there
it's like

10068
02:48:31,910 --> 02:48:31,920
it's like
 

10069
02:48:31,920 --> 02:48:33,750
it's like
nothing

10070
02:48:33,750 --> 02:48:33,760
nothing
 

10071
02:48:33,760 --> 02:48:35,269
nothing
it's real

10072
02:48:35,269 --> 02:48:35,279
it's real
 

10073
02:48:35,279 --> 02:48:36,150
it's real
so

10074
02:48:36,150 --> 02:48:36,160
so
 

10075
02:48:36,160 --> 02:48:38,950
so
what is going on here what

10076
02:48:38,950 --> 02:48:38,960
what is going on here what
 

10077
02:48:38,960 --> 02:48:43,990
what is going on here what
what am i experiencing back there

10078
02:48:43,990 --> 02:48:44,000

 

10079
02:48:44,000 --> 02:48:46,469

right well it's it's i i don't know if

10080
02:48:46,469 --> 02:48:46,479
right well it's it's i i don't know if
 

10081
02:48:46,479 --> 02:48:48,469
right well it's it's i i don't know if
it's nothing it's it's like i guess it's

10082
02:48:48,469 --> 02:48:48,479
it's nothing it's it's like i guess it's
 

10083
02:48:48,479 --> 02:48:50,630
it's nothing it's it's like i guess it's
the absence of it's not even like

10084
02:48:50,630 --> 02:48:50,640
the absence of it's not even like
 

10085
02:48:50,640 --> 02:48:52,630
the absence of it's not even like
darkness or something it's it even it's

10086
02:48:52,630 --> 02:48:52,640
darkness or something it's it even it's
 

10087
02:48:52,640 --> 02:48:54,070
darkness or something it's it even it's
not even darkness

10088
02:48:54,070 --> 02:48:54,080
not even darkness
 

10089
02:48:54,080 --> 02:48:56,389
not even darkness
there's no there's no

10090
02:48:56,389 --> 02:48:56,399
there's no there's no
 

10091
02:48:56,399 --> 02:48:58,550
there's no there's no
qualia

10092
02:48:58,550 --> 02:48:58,560
qualia
 

10093
02:48:58,560 --> 02:49:00,950
qualia
and yet there is a sense of being

10094
02:49:00,950 --> 02:49:00,960
and yet there is a sense of being
 

10095
02:49:00,960 --> 02:49:02,230
and yet there is a sense of being
and that's the interesting thing there's

10096
02:49:02,230 --> 02:49:02,240
and that's the interesting thing there's
 

10097
02:49:02,240 --> 02:49:05,030
and that's the interesting thing there's
a sense of being back so i close my

10098
02:49:05,030 --> 02:49:05,040
a sense of being back so i close my
 

10099
02:49:05,040 --> 02:49:06,710
a sense of being back so i close my
if i put my attention forward i just i

10100
02:49:06,710 --> 02:49:06,720
if i put my attention forward i just i
 

10101
02:49:06,720 --> 02:49:08,710
if i put my attention forward i just i
have the quality of a gray model thing

10102
02:49:08,710 --> 02:49:08,720
have the quality of a gray model thing
 

10103
02:49:08,720 --> 02:49:10,230
have the quality of a gray model thing
but when i put my attention backward

10104
02:49:10,230 --> 02:49:10,240

um i start
playing the engine of memory replay

10120
02:49:28,790 --> 02:49:28,800
playing the engine of memory replay
 

10121
02:49:28,800 --> 02:49:30,790
playing the engine of memory replay
which is like i i take myself back in

10122
02:49:30,790 --> 02:49:30,800
which is like i i take myself back in
 

10123

10129
02:49:36,399 --> 02:49:38,550
i see when i'm behind so which that's an
interesting quirk of hum humans too

10130
02:49:38,550 --> 02:49:38,560
interesting quirk of hum humans too
 

10131
02:49:38,560 --> 02:49:40,469
interesting quirk of hum humans too
we're able to we're collecting these

10132
02:49:40,469 --> 02:49:40,479
we're able to we're collecting these
 

10133
02:49:40,479 --> 02:49:42,230
we're able to we're collecting these
experiences and we can replay them in

10134
02:49:42,230 --> 02:49:42,240
experiences and we can replay them in
 

10135
02:49:42,240 --> 02:49:43,910
experiences and we can replay them in
interesting ways whenever we feel like

10136
02:49:43,910 --> 02:49:43,920
interesting ways whenever we feel like
 

10137
02:49:43,920 --> 02:49:46,469
interesting ways whenever we feel like
it and it's almost like being there

10138
02:49:46,469 --> 02:49:46,479
it and it's almost like being there
 

10139
02:49:46,479 --> 02:49:49,349
it and it's almost like being there
but not really but almost

10140
02:49:49,349 --> 02:49:49,359
but not really but almost
 

10141
02:49:49,359 --> 02:49:50,469
but not really but almost
that's right

10142
02:49:50,469 --> 02:49:50,479
that's right
 

10143
02:49:50,479 --> 02:49:52,469
that's right
and yet we can go our entire lives on

10144
02:49:52,469 --> 02:49:52,479
and yet we can go our entire lives on
 

10145
02:49:52,479 --> 02:49:53,830
and yet we can go our entire lives on
this you're talking about the minimal

10146
02:49:53,830 --> 02:49:53,840
this you're talking about the minimal
 

10147
02:49:53,840 --> 02:49:55,830
this you're talking about the minimal
thing for vr we can go our entire lives

could see this with with children right
 

10177
02:50:25,120 --> 02:50:26,870
could see this with with children right
with persistence you know you could do

10178
02:50:26,870 --> 02:50:26,880
with persistence you know you could do
 

10179
02:50:26,880 --> 02:50:29,269

the peekaboo game you can hide from them

10180
02:50:29,269 --> 02:50:29,279
the peekaboo game you can hide from them
 

10181
02:50:29,279 --> 02:50:30,630
the peekaboo game you can hide from them
and appear

10182

and appear
 

10183
02:50:30,640 --> 02:50:32,469
and appear
and they're fully tricked and in the

10184

and they're fully tricked and in the
 

10185
02:50:32,479 --> 02:50:34,550
and they're fully tricked and in the
same way we're fully tricked

10186
02:50:34,550 --> 02:50:34,560
same way we're fully tricked
 

10187

there is
 

10191
02:50:37,840 --> 02:50:39,990
there is
that's really interesting these theories

10192
02:50:39,990 --> 02:50:40,000
that's really interesting these theories
 

10193
02:50:40,000 --> 02:50:42,309
that's really interesting these theories
are pretty heavy

10194
02:50:42,309 --> 02:50:42,319
are pretty heavy
 

10195
02:50:42,319 --> 02:50:44,230
are pretty heavy

how has
 

10201
02:50:48,160 --> 02:50:49,750
how has
these theories been to you personally

10202
02:50:49,750 --> 02:50:49,760
these theories been to you personally
 

10203
02:50:49,760 --> 02:50:51,590
these theories been to you personally
like are there good days and bad days

10204
02:50:51,590 --> 02:50:51,600
like are there good days and bad days
 

10205

like are there good days and bad days
when you wake up and look in the mirror

10206
02:50:53,990 --> 02:50:54,000
when you wake up and look in the mirror
 

10207
02:50:54,000 --> 02:50:56,070
when you wake up and look in the mirror
and the fact that you can't see anything

and the fact that you can't see anything
 

10209

behind you
the fact that it's rendered like is

10212
02:50:58,950 --> 02:50:58,960
the fact that it's rendered like is
 

10213
02:50:58,960 --> 02:51:01,349
the fact that it's rendered like is
there interesting quirks

10214
02:51:01,349 --> 02:51:01,359
there interesting quirks
 

10215
02:51:01,359 --> 02:51:03,590
there interesting quirks
you know you know nietzsche with his if

10216

it's been very very difficult

10226
02:51:16,389 --> 02:51:16,399
it's been very very difficult
 

10227
02:51:16,399 --> 02:51:18,870
it's been very very difficult
this stuff is not just abstract

10228
02:51:18,870 --> 02:51:18,880
this stuff is not just abstract
 

10229
02:51:18,880 --> 02:51:21,590
this stuff is not just abstract
theory building because it's about us

10230
02:51:21,590 --> 02:51:21,600
theory building because it's about us
 

10231
02:51:21,600 --> 02:51:22,950
theory building because it's about us
sometimes i realize that there's this

10232
02:51:22,950 --> 02:51:22,960
sometimes i realize that there's this
 

10233
02:51:22,960 --> 02:51:25,830
sometimes i realize that there's this
big division of me my my mind is doing

10234
02:51:25,830 --> 02:51:25,840
big division of me my my mind is doing
 

10235
02:51:25,840 --> 02:51:27,429
big division of me my my mind is doing
all this science and and coming up with

10236
02:51:27,429 --> 02:51:27,439
all this science and and coming up with
 

10237
02:51:27,439 --> 02:51:29,269
all this science and and coming up with
these conclusions and the rest of me is

10238
02:51:29,269 --> 02:51:29,279
these conclusions and the rest of me is
 

10239
02:51:29,279 --> 02:51:30,550
these conclusions and the rest of me is
not integrating i was just like i don't

10240
02:51:30,550 --> 02:51:30,560
not integrating i was just like i don't
 

10241
02:51:30,560 --> 02:51:32,230
not integrating i was just like i don't
believe it i just don't believe this i

10242
02:51:32,230 --> 02:51:32,240
believe it i just don't believe this i
 

10243
02:51:32,240 --> 02:51:34,950
believe it i just don't believe this i
mean it seems so as i start to take it

10244
02:51:34,950 --> 02:51:34,960
mean it seems so as i start to take it
 

10245
02:51:34,960 --> 02:51:36,870
mean it seems so as i start to take it
seriously it's get i get scared myself

10246
02:51:36,870 --> 02:51:36,880
seriously it's get i get scared myself
 

10247
02:51:36,880 --> 02:51:39,590
seriously it's get i get scared myself
it's like

10248
02:51:39,590 --> 02:51:39,600

 

10249
02:51:39,600 --> 02:51:41,990

but it's very much then i read these

10250
02:51:41,990 --> 02:51:42,000
but it's very much then i read these
 

10251
02:51:42,000 --> 02:51:43,349
but it's very much then i read these
spiritual traditions and realize they're

10252
02:51:43,349 --> 02:51:43,359
spiritual traditions and realize they're
 

10253
02:51:43,359 --> 02:51:45,110
spiritual traditions and realize they're
saying very very similar things it's

10254
02:51:45,110 --> 02:51:45,120
saying very very similar things it's
 

10255
02:51:45,120 --> 02:51:48,389
saying very very similar things it's
like there's a lot of conversions so for

10256
02:51:48,389 --> 02:51:48,399
like there's a lot of conversions so for
 

10257
02:51:48,399 --> 02:51:49,349
like there's a lot of conversions so for

i

10260
02:51:50,550 --> 02:51:50,560
i
 

10261
02:51:50,560 --> 02:51:52,710
i
have

10262

have
 

10263
02:51:52,720 --> 02:51:54,630
have
the first time i thought

10264
02:51:54,630 --> 02:51:54,640
the first time i thought
 

10265
02:51:54,640 --> 02:51:55,910
the first time i thought
it might be possible that we're not

10266
02:51:55,910 --> 02:51:55,920
it might be possible that we're not
 

10267
02:51:55,920 --> 02:51:57,830
it might be possible that we're not
seeing the truth

10268
02:51:57,830 --> 02:51:57,840
seeing the truth
 

10269
02:51:57,840 --> 02:51:59,830
seeing the truth
was in

10270
02:51:59,830 --> 02:51:59,840
was in
 

10271
02:51:59,840 --> 02:52:01,190
was in
it was from some mathematics we were

10272
02:52:01,190 --> 02:52:01,200
it was from some mathematics we were
 

10273
02:52:01,200 --> 02:52:02,469
it was from some mathematics we were
doing

10274
02:52:02,469 --> 02:52:02,479
doing
 

10275
02:52:02,479 --> 02:52:03,190
doing
and

10276
02:52:03,190 --> 02:52:03,200
and
 

10277
02:52:03,200 --> 02:52:05,590
and
when that hit me it hit me like a ton of

10278
02:52:05,590 --> 02:52:05,600
when that hit me it hit me like a ton of
 

10279
02:52:05,600 --> 02:52:07,349
when that hit me it hit me like a ton of
bricks i had to sit down it was

10280
02:52:07,349 --> 02:52:07,359
bricks i had to sit down it was
 

10281
02:52:07,359 --> 02:52:09,990
bricks i had to sit down it was
it it really

10282
02:52:09,990 --> 02:52:10,000
it it really
 

10283
02:52:10,000 --> 02:52:12,790
it it really
it was scary it was really a shock to

10284
02:52:12,790 --> 02:52:12,800
it was scary it was really a shock to
 

10285
02:52:12,800 --> 02:52:15,910
it was scary it was really a shock to
the system and then to realize that

10286
02:52:15,910 --> 02:52:15,920
the system and then to realize that
 

10287
02:52:15,920 --> 02:52:17,990
the system and then to realize that
everything that has been important to me

10288
02:52:17,990 --> 02:52:18,000
everything that has been important to me
 

10289
02:52:18,000 --> 02:52:19,269
everything that has been important to me
like

10290
02:52:19,269 --> 02:52:19,279
like
 

10291
02:52:19,279 --> 02:52:20,230
like
you know

10292
02:52:20,230 --> 02:52:20,240
you know
 

10293
02:52:20,240 --> 02:52:22,309
you know
getting a house

10294
02:52:22,309 --> 02:52:22,319
getting a house
 

10295
02:52:22,319 --> 02:52:23,510
getting a house
getting a car

10296
02:52:23,510 --> 02:52:23,520
getting a car
 

10297
02:52:23,520 --> 02:52:26,389
getting a car

10299
02:52:26,399 --> 02:52:28,630
getting a reputation and so forth
well that car is just like the car i see

10300
02:52:28,630 --> 02:52:28,640
well that car is just like the car i see
 

10301
02:52:28,640 --> 02:52:30,070
well that car is just like the car i see
in the virtual reality it's there when

10302
02:52:30,070 --> 02:52:30,080
in the virtual reality it's there when
 

10303
02:52:30,080 --> 02:52:32,630
in the virtual reality it's there when
you perceive it it's not there

10304
02:52:32,630 --> 02:52:32,640
you perceive it it's not there
 

10305
02:52:32,640 --> 02:52:33,429
you perceive it it's not there
so

10306
02:52:33,429 --> 02:52:33,439
so
 

10307
02:52:33,439 --> 02:52:35,590
so
the whole question of you know what am i

10308
02:52:35,590 --> 02:52:35,600
the whole question of you know what am i
 

10309
02:52:35,600 --> 02:52:37,590
the whole question of you know what am i
doing and why what what's what's

10310
02:52:37,590 --> 02:52:37,600
doing and why what what's what's
 

10311
02:52:37,600 --> 02:52:40,469
doing and why what what's what's
worthwhile doing in life

10312
02:52:40,469 --> 02:52:40,479
worthwhile doing in life
 

10313
02:52:40,479 --> 02:52:43,030
worthwhile doing in life
clearly

10314
02:52:43,030 --> 02:52:43,040
clearly
 

10315
02:52:43,040 --> 02:52:44,550
clearly
getting a big house and getting a big

10316
02:52:44,550 --> 02:52:44,560
getting a big house and getting a big
 

10317
02:52:44,560 --> 02:52:45,830
getting a big house and getting a big
car

10318
02:52:45,830 --> 02:52:45,840
car
 

10319
02:52:45,840 --> 02:52:46,950
car
i mean we all knew that we were going to

10320
02:52:46,950 --> 02:52:46,960
i mean we all knew that we were going to
 

10321
02:52:46,960 --> 02:52:48,070
i mean we all knew that we were going to
die

10322
02:52:48,070 --> 02:52:48,080
die
 

10323
02:52:48,080 --> 02:52:49,110
die
so we we

10324
02:52:49,110 --> 02:52:49,120
so we we
 

10325
02:52:49,120 --> 02:52:50,950
so we we
we we tend not to know that we tend to

10326
02:52:50,950 --> 02:52:50,960
we we tend not to know that we tend to
 

10327
02:52:50,960 --> 02:52:52,469
we we tend not to know that we tend to
hide it especially when we were young

10328
02:52:52,469 --> 02:52:52,479
hide it especially when we were young
 

10329
02:52:52,479 --> 02:52:53,830
hide it especially when we were young
before age 30 we don't believe we're

10330
02:52:53,830 --> 02:52:53,840
before age 30 we don't believe we're
 

10331
02:52:53,840 --> 02:52:56,469
before age 30 we don't believe we're
going to die yeah we factually maybe

10332
02:52:56,469 --> 02:52:56,479
going to die yeah we factually maybe
 

10333
02:52:56,479 --> 02:52:58,150
going to die yeah we factually maybe
know that you're you kind of are

10334
02:52:58,150 --> 02:52:58,160
know that you're you kind of are
 

10335
02:52:58,160 --> 02:53:00,070
know that you're you kind of are
supposed to yeah but but they'll figure

10336
02:53:00,070 --> 02:53:00,080
supposed to yeah but but they'll figure
 

10337
02:53:00,080 --> 02:53:01,670
supposed to yeah but but they'll figure
something out and yeah we'll be the

10338
02:53:01,670 --> 02:53:01,680
something out and yeah we'll be the
 

10339
02:53:01,680 --> 02:53:02,870
something out and yeah we'll be the
generation that is the first one that

10340
02:53:02,870 --> 02:53:02,880
generation that is the first one that
 

10341
02:53:02,880 --> 02:53:04,150
generation that is the first one that
doesn't have to die

10342
02:53:04,150 --> 02:53:04,160
doesn't have to die
 

10343
02:53:04,160 --> 02:53:05,590
doesn't have to die
that's the kind of thing but but when

10344
02:53:05,590 --> 02:53:05,600
that's the kind of thing but but when
 

10345
02:53:05,600 --> 02:53:08,230
that's the kind of thing but but when
you really face the fact that

10346
02:53:08,230 --> 02:53:08,240
you really face the fact that
 

10347
02:53:08,240 --> 02:53:11,269
you really face the fact that
you're going to die

10348
02:53:11,269 --> 02:53:11,279
you're going to die
 

10349
02:53:11,279 --> 02:53:12,469
you're going to die
and then when you when i start to look

10350
02:53:12,469 --> 02:53:12,479
and then when you when i start to look
 

10351
02:53:12,479 --> 02:53:13,670
and then when you when i start to look
at it from this point of view that well

10352
02:53:13,670 --> 02:53:13,680
at it from this point of view that well
 

10353
02:53:13,680 --> 02:53:15,670
at it from this point of view that well
this thing was an interface to begin

10354
02:53:15,670 --> 02:53:15,680
this thing was an interface to begin
 

10355
02:53:15,680 --> 02:53:18,230
this thing was an interface to begin
with so what i'm really is what i'm

10356
02:53:18,230 --> 02:53:18,240
with so what i'm really is what i'm
 

10357
02:53:18,240 --> 02:53:20,070
with so what i'm really is what i'm
really going to be doing

10358
02:53:20,070 --> 02:53:20,080
really going to be doing
 

10359
02:53:20,080 --> 02:53:22,150
really going to be doing
just taking off a headset so i've been

10360
02:53:22,150 --> 02:53:22,160
just taking off a headset so i've been
 

10361
02:53:22,160 --> 02:53:23,429
just taking off a headset so i've been
playing in a virtual reality game all

10362
02:53:23,429 --> 02:53:23,439
playing in a virtual reality game all
 

10363
02:53:23,439 --> 02:53:25,910
playing in a virtual reality game all
day and i i got lost in the game when i

10364
02:53:25,910 --> 02:53:25,920
day and i i got lost in the game when i
 

10365
02:53:25,920 --> 02:53:28,870
day and i i got lost in the game when i
was fighting over a porsche and i i shot

10366
02:53:28,870 --> 02:53:28,880
was fighting over a porsche and i i shot
 

10367
02:53:28,880 --> 02:53:31,269
was fighting over a porsche and i i shot
some guys up and i punctured their tires

10368
02:53:31,269 --> 02:53:31,279
some guys up and i punctured their tires
 

10369
02:53:31,279 --> 02:53:33,349
some guys up and i punctured their tires
and i got the porsche now i take the

10370
02:53:33,349 --> 02:53:33,359
and i got the porsche now i take the
 

10371
02:53:33,359 --> 02:53:35,110
and i got the porsche now i take the
headset off and what was that for

10372
02:53:35,110 --> 02:53:35,120
headset off and what was that for
 

10373
02:53:35,120 --> 02:53:37,190
headset off and what was that for
nothing there was just it was a data

10374
02:53:37,190 --> 02:53:37,200
nothing there was just it was a data
 

10375
02:53:37,200 --> 02:53:39,030
nothing there was just it was a data
structure and the data structure is gone

10376
02:53:39,030 --> 02:53:39,040
structure and the data structure is gone
 

10377
02:53:39,040 --> 02:53:41,510
structure and the data structure is gone
so so all of the wars the fighting and

10378
02:53:41,510 --> 02:53:41,520
so so all of the wars the fighting and
 

10379
02:53:41,520 --> 02:53:43,910
so so all of the wars the fighting and
the reputations and all this stuff you

10380
02:53:43,910 --> 02:53:43,920
the reputations and all this stuff you
 

10381
02:53:43,920 --> 02:53:45,590
the reputations and all this stuff you
know

10382
02:53:45,590 --> 02:53:45,600
know
 

10383
02:53:45,600 --> 02:53:47,990
know
where it's just a headset

10384
02:53:47,990 --> 02:53:48,000
where it's just a headset
 

10385
02:53:48,000 --> 02:53:50,950
where it's just a headset
so now and you know so my theory says

10386
02:53:50,950 --> 02:53:50,960
so now and you know so my theory says
 

10387
02:53:50,960 --> 02:53:52,469
so now and you know so my theory says
that intellectually

10388
02:53:52,469 --> 02:53:52,479
that intellectually
 

10389
02:53:52,479 --> 02:53:54,469
that intellectually
my my

10390
02:53:54,469 --> 02:53:54,479

you're not being intellectual you're but

10438
02:54:47,429 --> 02:54:47,439
you're not being intellectual you're but
 

10439
02:54:47,439 --> 02:54:49,429
you're not being intellectual you're but
you're still experiencing it right so

10440
02:54:49,429 --> 02:54:49,439
you're still experiencing it right so
 

10441
02:54:49,439 --> 02:54:51,670
you're still experiencing it right so
it's when you turn on the like the

10442
02:54:51,670 --> 02:54:51,680
it's when you turn on the like the
 

10443
02:54:51,680 --> 02:54:54,070
it's when you turn on the like the
introspective machine that's when you

10444
02:54:54,070 --> 02:54:54,080
introspective machine that's when you
 

10445
02:54:54,080 --> 02:54:56,950
introspective machine that's when you
can start and turn off the thinker when

10446
02:54:56,950 --> 02:54:56,960
can start and turn off the thinker when
 

10447
02:54:56,960 --> 02:54:59,190
can start and turn off the thinker when
i actually just start looking without

10448
02:54:59,190 --> 02:54:59,200
i actually just start looking without
 

10449
02:54:59,200 --> 02:55:00,790
i actually just start looking without
thinking

10450
02:55:00,790 --> 02:55:00,800
thinking
 

10451
02:55:00,800 --> 02:55:03,670
thinking
so that's that's when i feel like i

10452
02:55:03,670 --> 02:55:03,680
so that's that's when i feel like i
 

10453
02:55:03,680 --> 02:55:05,190
so that's that's when i feel like i
all of a sudden i'm starting to see

10454
02:55:05,190 --> 02:55:05,200
all of a sudden i'm starting to see
 

10455
02:55:05,200 --> 02:55:06,710
all of a sudden i'm starting to see
through

10456
02:55:06,710 --> 02:55:06,720
through
 

10457
02:55:06,720 --> 02:55:08,790
through
sort of like okay

10458
02:55:08,790 --> 02:55:08,800
sort of like okay

sort of like okay
part of

10460
02:55:10,070 --> 02:55:10,080
part of
 

10461
02:55:10,080 --> 02:55:13,110
part of
part of the addiction to the interface

10462
02:55:13,110 --> 02:55:13,120
part of the addiction to the interface
 

10463
02:55:13,120 --> 02:55:14,630
part of the addiction to the interface
is all the stories i'm telling about

10464
02:55:14,630 --> 02:55:14,640
is all the stories i'm telling about
 

10465
02:55:14,640 --> 02:55:15,910
is all the stories i'm telling about
it's really important for me to get that

10466
02:55:15,910 --> 02:55:15,920
it's really important for me to get that
 

10467
02:55:15,920 --> 02:55:17,030
it's really important for me to get that
really important

10468
02:55:17,030 --> 02:55:17,040
really important
 

10469
02:55:17,040 --> 02:55:18,710
really important
to do that all so i'm telling all these

10470
02:55:18,710 --> 02:55:18,720
to do that all so i'm telling all these
 

10471
02:55:18,720 --> 02:55:21,670
to do that all so i'm telling all these
stories and so i'm all wrapped up

10472
02:55:21,670 --> 02:55:21,680
stories and so i'm all wrapped up
 

10473
02:55:21,680 --> 02:55:23,190
stories and so i'm all wrapped up
almost all the mind stuff that's going

10474
02:55:23,190 --> 02:55:23,200
almost all the mind stuff that's going
 

10475
02:55:23,200 --> 02:55:26,070
almost all the mind stuff that's going
on in my head is about

10476
02:55:26,070 --> 02:55:26,080
on in my head is about
 

10477
02:55:26,080 --> 02:55:28,630
on in my head is about
attachment to the interface

10478
02:55:28,630 --> 02:55:28,640
attachment to the interface
 

10479
02:55:28,640 --> 02:55:31,590
attachment to the interface
and so what i found

10480
02:55:31,590 --> 02:55:31,600
and so what i found
 

10481
02:55:31,600 --> 02:55:33,590
and so what i found
is that

10482
02:55:33,590 --> 02:55:33,600
is that
 

10483
02:55:33,600 --> 02:55:34,389
is that
the

10484
02:55:34,389 --> 02:55:34,399
the
 

10485
02:55:34,399 --> 02:55:36,790
the
essentially the only way to really

10486
02:55:36,790 --> 02:55:36,800
essentially the only way to really
 

10487
02:55:36,800 --> 02:55:38,710
essentially the only way to really
detach from the interface

10488
02:55:38,710 --> 02:55:38,720
detach from the interface
 

10489
02:55:38,720 --> 02:55:39,610
detach from the interface
is to

10490
02:55:39,610 --> 02:55:39,620
is to
 

10491
02:55:39,620 --> 02:55:41,349
is to

literally let go of thoughts altogether
 

10495
02:55:44,240 --> 02:55:46,630
literally let go of thoughts altogether
and then all of a sudden

10496
02:55:46,630 --> 02:55:46,640
and then all of a sudden
 

10497
02:55:46,640 --> 02:55:47,349
and then all of a sudden
um

10498

interface story
 

10517
02:56:07,040 --> 02:56:09,429
interface story

meaning like

10580
02:57:11,590 --> 02:57:11,600
meaning like
 

10581
02:57:11,600 --> 02:57:14,309
meaning like
it's uh

10582
02:57:14,309 --> 02:57:14,319

 

10583
02:57:14,319 --> 02:57:16,230

i mean some of these ideas when you

10584
02:57:16,230 --> 02:57:16,240
i mean some of these ideas when you
 

10585
02:57:16,240 --> 02:57:17,910
i mean some of these ideas when you
think about reality even with like

10586
02:57:17,910 --> 02:57:17,920
think about reality even with like
 

10587
02:57:17,920 --> 02:57:19,990
think about reality even with like
einstein

10588
02:57:19,990 --> 02:57:20,000
einstein
 

10589
02:57:20,000 --> 02:57:22,550
einstein
just realizing you said interface just

10590
02:57:22,550 --> 02:57:22,560
just realizing you said interface just
 

10591
02:57:22,560 --> 02:57:24,230
just realizing you said interface just
realizing that

10592
02:57:24,230 --> 02:57:24,240
realizing that
 

10593
02:57:24,240 --> 02:57:26,469
realizing that
light

10594
02:57:26,469 --> 02:57:26,479
light
 

10595
02:57:26,479 --> 02:57:27,990
light
you know that there's a speed of light

10596
02:57:27,990 --> 02:57:28,000
you know that there's a speed of light
 

10597
02:57:28,000 --> 02:57:29,510
you know that there's a speed of light
and you can't go fast in the speed of

10598
02:57:29,510 --> 02:57:29,520
and you can't go fast in the speed of
 

10599
02:57:29,520 --> 02:57:31,510
and you can't go fast in the speed of
light and like what kind of things black

10600
02:57:31,510 --> 02:57:31,520
light and like what kind of things black
 

10601
02:57:31,520 --> 02:57:32,870
light and like what kind of things black
holes and

10602
02:57:32,870 --> 02:57:32,880
holes and
 

10603
02:57:32,880 --> 02:57:35,429
holes and
can do with light even that can mess

10604
02:57:35,429 --> 02:57:35,439
can do with light even that can mess
 

10605
02:57:35,439 --> 02:57:36,950
can do with light even that can mess
with your head

10606
02:57:36,950 --> 02:57:36,960
with your head
 

10607
02:57:36,960 --> 02:57:38,070
with your head
yes

10608
02:57:38,070 --> 02:57:38,080
yes
 

10609
02:57:38,080 --> 02:57:40,790
yes
but that's still space time

10610
02:57:40,790 --> 02:57:40,800
but that's still space time
 

10611
02:57:40,800 --> 02:57:42,150
but that's still space time
that's a big mess but it's still just

10612
02:57:42,150 --> 02:57:42,160
that's a big mess but it's still just
 

10613
02:57:42,160 --> 02:57:43,830
that's a big mess but it's still just
space-time it's still a property over

10614
02:57:43,830 --> 02:57:43,840
space-time it's still a property over
 

10615
02:57:43,840 --> 02:57:45,830
space-time it's still a property over
interface that's right but it's still

10616
02:57:45,830 --> 02:57:45,840
interface that's right but it's still
 

10617
02:57:45,840 --> 02:57:48,550
interface that's right but it's still
like even so

10618
02:57:48,550 --> 02:57:48,560
like even so
 

10619
02:57:48,560 --> 02:57:50,309
like even so
even einstein realized that this

10620
02:57:50,309 --> 02:57:50,319
even einstein realized that this
 

10621
02:57:50,319 --> 02:57:52,230
even einstein realized that this
particular thing some of the stories we

10622
02:57:52,230 --> 02:57:52,240
particular thing some of the stories we
 

10623
02:57:52,240 --> 02:57:54,550
particular thing some of the stories we
tell ourselves is constructing

10624
02:57:54,550 --> 02:57:54,560
tell ourselves is constructing
 

10625
02:57:54,560 --> 02:57:55,990
tell ourselves is constructing
interfaces

10626
02:57:55,990 --> 02:57:56,000
interfaces
 

10627
02:57:56,000 --> 02:57:57,030
interfaces
that are

10628
02:57:57,030 --> 02:57:57,040
that are
 

10629
02:57:57,040 --> 02:58:00,309
that are
oversimplifying the way things work

10630
02:58:00,309 --> 02:58:00,319
oversimplifying the way things work
 

10631
02:58:00,319 --> 02:58:02,230
oversimplifying the way things work
because the it's nice the stories are

10632
02:58:02,230 --> 02:58:02,240
because the it's nice the stories are
 

10633
02:58:02,240 --> 02:58:03,510
because the it's nice the stories are
nice

10634
02:58:03,510 --> 02:58:03,520
nice
 

10635
02:58:03,520 --> 02:58:05,269
nice
stories are nice this rep i mean just

10636
02:58:05,269 --> 02:58:05,279
stories are nice this rep i mean just
 

10637
02:58:05,279 --> 02:58:07,830
stories are nice this rep i mean just
like video games they're nice

10638
02:58:07,830 --> 02:58:07,840
like video games they're nice
 

10639
02:58:07,840 --> 02:58:09,830
like video games they're nice
right and but einstein was a realist

10640
02:58:09,830 --> 02:58:09,840
right and but einstein was a realist
 

10641
02:58:09,840 --> 02:58:11,670
right and but einstein was a realist
right he was a famous realist in this in

10642
02:58:11,670 --> 02:58:11,680
right he was a famous realist in this in
 

10643
02:58:11,680 --> 02:58:13,190
right he was a famous realist in this in
the sense that he he

10644
02:58:13,190 --> 02:58:13,200
the sense that he he
 

10645
02:58:13,200 --> 02:58:15,269
the sense that he he
was very explicit in a 1935 paper with

10646
02:58:15,269 --> 02:58:15,279
was very explicit in a 1935 paper with
 

10647
02:58:15,279 --> 02:58:17,990
was very explicit in a 1935 paper with
um podesta and rosen the epr paper where

10648
02:58:17,990 --> 02:58:18,000
um podesta and rosen the epr paper where
 

10649
02:58:18,000 --> 02:58:19,590
um podesta and rosen the epr paper where
he

10650
02:58:19,590 --> 02:58:19,600
he
 

10651
02:58:19,600 --> 02:58:21,110
he
they said

10652
02:58:21,110 --> 02:58:21,120
they said
 

10653
02:58:21,120 --> 02:58:22,630
they said
if without

10654
02:58:22,630 --> 02:58:22,640
if without
 

10655
02:58:22,640 --> 02:58:23,830
if without
in any way

10656
02:58:23,830 --> 02:58:23,840
in any way
 

10657
02:58:23,840 --> 02:58:25,990
in any way
disturbing a system

10658
02:58:25,990 --> 02:58:26,000
disturbing a system
 

10659
02:58:26,000 --> 02:58:28,389
disturbing a system
i can predict with probability one

10660
02:58:28,389 --> 02:58:28,399
i can predict with probability one
 

10661
02:58:28,399 --> 02:58:30,870
i can predict with probability one
the outcome of a measurement

10662
02:58:30,870 --> 02:58:30,880
the outcome of a measurement
 

10663
02:58:30,880 --> 02:58:34,150
the outcome of a measurement
then there exists in reality

10664
02:58:34,150 --> 02:58:34,160
then there exists in reality
 

10665
02:58:34,160 --> 02:58:35,510
then there exists in reality
that element

10666
02:58:35,510 --> 02:58:35,520
that element
 

10667
02:58:35,520 --> 02:58:37,510
that element
right that that value that

10668
02:58:37,510 --> 02:58:37,520
right that that value that
 

10669
02:58:37,520 --> 02:58:39,670
right that that value that
and we now know from quantum theory that

10670
02:58:39,670 --> 02:58:39,680
and we now know from quantum theory that
 

10671
02:58:39,680 --> 02:58:41,830
and we now know from quantum theory that
that that's false

10672
02:58:41,830 --> 02:58:41,840
that that's false
 

10673
02:58:41,840 --> 02:58:44,790
that that's false
that einstein's idea of local realism is

10674
02:58:44,790 --> 02:58:44,800
that einstein's idea of local realism is
 

10675
02:58:44,800 --> 02:58:47,269
that einstein's idea of local realism is
is strictly speaking false

10676
02:58:47,269 --> 02:58:47,279
is strictly speaking false
 

10677
02:58:47,279 --> 02:58:50,309
is strictly speaking false
yeah and and so we can predict we can

10678
02:58:50,309 --> 02:58:50,319
yeah and and so we can predict we can
 

10679
02:58:50,319 --> 02:58:52,790
yeah and and so we can predict we can
set up in quantum theory you can set up

10680
02:58:52,790 --> 02:58:52,800
set up in quantum theory you can set up
 

10681
02:58:52,800 --> 02:58:54,230
set up in quantum theory you can set up
and there's a there's a paper by chris

10682
02:58:54,230 --> 02:58:54,240
and there's a there's a paper by chris
 

10683

where he

10686
02:58:57,590 --> 02:58:57,600
where he
 

10687
02:58:57,600 --> 02:58:59,110
where he
he scouts this out it was done by other

10688
02:58:59,110 --> 02:58:59,120
he scouts this out it was done by other
 

10689
02:58:59,120 --> 02:59:00,790
he scouts this out it was done by other
people but he gives a good presentation

10690
02:59:00,790 --> 02:59:00,800
people but he gives a good presentation
 

10691
02:59:00,800 --> 02:59:02,389
people but he gives a good presentation
of this where they have a sequence of

10692
02:59:02,389 --> 02:59:02,399
of this where they have a sequence of
 

10693
02:59:02,399 --> 02:59:03,590
of this where they have a sequence of
like something like nine different

10694
02:59:03,590 --> 02:59:03,600
like something like nine different
 

10695
02:59:03,600 --> 02:59:05,269
like something like nine different
quantum measurements that that you can

10696
02:59:05,269 --> 02:59:05,279
quantum measurements that that you can
 

10697
02:59:05,279 --> 02:59:06,150
quantum measurements that that you can
make

10698
02:59:06,150 --> 02:59:06,160
make
 

10699
02:59:06,160 --> 02:59:06,950
make
and

10700
02:59:06,950 --> 02:59:06,960
and
 

10701
02:59:06,960 --> 02:59:08,630
and
you can predict with probability one

10702
02:59:08,630 --> 02:59:08,640
you can predict with probability one
 

10703
02:59:08,640 --> 02:59:10,550
you can predict with probability one
what a particular outcome will be but

10704
02:59:10,550 --> 02:59:10,560
what a particular outcome will be but
 

10705
02:59:10,560 --> 02:59:12,790
what a particular outcome will be but
you can actually prove

10706
02:59:12,790 --> 02:59:12,800
you can actually prove
 

10707
02:59:12,800 --> 02:59:15,349
you can actually prove
that it's impossible

10708
02:59:15,349 --> 02:59:15,359
that it's impossible
 

10709
02:59:15,359 --> 02:59:16,469
that it's impossible
that the

10710
02:59:16,469 --> 02:59:16,479
that the
 

10711
02:59:16,479 --> 02:59:18,070
that the
value existed before you made the

10712
02:59:18,070 --> 02:59:18,080
value existed before you made the
 

10713
02:59:18,080 --> 02:59:19,590
value existed before you made the
measurement so you know with probability

10714
02:59:19,590 --> 02:59:19,600
measurement so you know with probability
 

10715
02:59:19,600 --> 02:59:20,950
measurement so you know with probability
one what you're going to get but you

10716
02:59:20,950 --> 02:59:20,960
one what you're going to get but you
 

10717
02:59:20,960 --> 02:59:23,510
one what you're going to get but you
also know with certainty that that value

10718
02:59:23,510 --> 02:59:23,520
also know with certainty that that value
 

10719
02:59:23,520 --> 02:59:24,790
also know with certainty that that value
was not there until you made the

10720
02:59:24,790 --> 02:59:24,800
was not there until you made the
 

10721
02:59:24,800 --> 02:59:26,950
was not there until you made the
measurement so the so we know from

10722
02:59:26,950 --> 02:59:26,960
measurement so the so we know from
 

10723
02:59:26,960 --> 02:59:28,870
measurement so the so we know from
quantum theory that the act of

10724
02:59:28,870 --> 02:59:28,880
quantum theory that the act of
 

10725
02:59:28,880 --> 02:59:33,030
quantum theory that the act of
observation is an act of fact creation

10726
02:59:33,030 --> 02:59:33,040
observation is an act of fact creation
 

10727
02:59:33,040 --> 02:59:34,550
observation is an act of fact creation
and that is

10728
02:59:34,550 --> 02:59:34,560
and that is
 

10729
02:59:34,560 --> 02:59:35,830
and that is
built into what i'm saying with this

10730
02:59:35,830 --> 02:59:35,840
built into what i'm saying with this
 

10731
02:59:35,840 --> 02:59:37,830
built into what i'm saying with this

the objects in it so local realism

10742
02:59:47,670 --> 02:59:47,680
the objects in it so local realism
 

10743
02:59:47,680 --> 02:59:50,070
the objects in it so local realism
is not true

10744

is not true
 

10745
02:59:50,080 --> 02:59:51,990

and that that it fits in perfectly with
 

10751
02:59:56,640 --> 02:59:57,750
and that that it fits in perfectly with
this idea that consciousness is

10752
02:59:57,750 --> 02:59:57,760
this idea that consciousness is
 

10753
02:59:57,760 --> 02:59:59,429
this idea that consciousness is
fundamental

10754
02:59:59,429 --> 02:59:59,439
fundamental
 

10755
02:59:59,439 --> 03:00:01,269
fundamental
these things are these exist as data

10909
03:02:38,640 --> 03:02:40,950
close to the reality of it it's not just
an intellectual reality it's

10910
03:02:40,950 --> 03:02:40,960
an intellectual reality it's
 

10911
03:02:40,960 --> 03:02:43,670
an intellectual reality it's
it's a reality of death

years now
 

10917
03:02:47,600 --> 03:02:49,510
years now
and then i would say averaging three or

10918
03:02:49,510 --> 03:02:49,520
and then i would say averaging three or
 

10919
03:02:49,520 --> 03:02:50,710
and then i would say averaging three or
four hours a day

10920
03:02:50,710 --> 03:02:50,720
four hours a day
 

10921

and i have the advantage of some science
 

10971
03:03:39,120 --> 03:03:40,710
and i have the advantage of some science
so i can look at what science says and

11007
03:04:13,040 --> 03:04:14,790
in-group and an out group
to try to

03:04:20,950 --> 03:04:20,960
these things that evolutionary
 

11015
03:04:20,960 --> 03:04:23,670
these things that evolutionary
psychology is is spot on it's really

11016

brilliant about the human condition
 

11019
03:04:26,240 --> 03:04:28,150
brilliant about the human condition
and yet i think evolution

11020
03:04:28,150 --> 03:04:28,160
and yet i think evolution
 

11021
03:04:28,160 --> 03:04:30,389
and yet i think evolution
as i said evolutionary theory

11022
03:04:30,389 --> 03:04:30,399
as i said evolutionary theory
 

11023
03:04:30,399 --> 03:04:32,070
as i said evolutionary theory
is a projection of a deeper theory where

11024
03:04:32,070 --> 03:04:32,080
is a projection of a deeper theory where
 

11025
03:04:32,080 --> 03:04:34,630
is a projection of a deeper theory where
there may be no competition

11026
03:04:34,630 --> 03:04:34,640
there may be no competition
 

11027
03:04:34,640 --> 03:04:37,429
there may be no competition

03:04:41,439 --> 03:04:43,510
where i feel like okay according to my
own theory i'm consciousness and maybe

11034
03:04:43,510 --> 03:04:43,520
own theory i'm consciousness and maybe
 

11035
03:04:43,520 --> 03:04:46,150
own theory i'm consciousness and maybe
this is what it means for consciousness

11036
03:04:46,150 --> 03:04:46,160
this is what it means for consciousness
 

11037
03:04:46,160 --> 03:04:49,030
this is what it means for consciousness
to wake up it's not easy

to then look at that and then look at

11056
03:05:08,870 --> 03:05:08,880
to then look at that and then look at
 

11057
03:05:08,880 --> 03:05:10,230
to then look at that and then look at
the fact that

11058
03:05:10,230 --> 03:05:10,240
the fact that
 

11059
03:05:10,240 --> 03:05:11,429
the fact that
i'm going to walk away from this anyway

11060
03:05:11,429 --> 03:05:11,439
i'm going to walk away from this anyway
 

11061
03:05:11,439 --> 03:05:13,750
i'm going to walk away from this anyway
and it's just an interface how do i so

11062
03:05:13,750 --> 03:05:13,760
and it's just an interface how do i so
 

11063
03:05:13,760 --> 03:05:15,750
and it's just an interface how do i so
it's it's trying to put all this stuff

11064
03:05:15,750 --> 03:05:15,760
it's it's trying to put all this stuff
 

11065
03:05:15,760 --> 03:05:17,830
it's it's trying to put all this stuff
together and really

11066
03:05:17,830 --> 03:05:17,840
together and really
 

11067
03:05:17,840 --> 03:05:19,670
together and really
grok it so to speak not just

11068
03:05:19,670 --> 03:05:19,680
grok it so to speak not just
 

11069
03:05:19,680 --> 03:05:21,830
grok it so to speak not just
intellectually but rocket

11070
03:05:21,830 --> 03:05:21,840
intellectually but rocket
 

11071
03:05:21,840 --> 03:05:23,590
intellectually but rocket

11075
03:05:26,880 --> 03:05:29,910
of you silly evolved organism that's
gotten way too attached to the interface

11076
03:05:29,910 --> 03:05:29,920
gotten way too attached to the interface
 

11077
03:05:29,920 --> 03:05:32,070

what's the role of love in our

11090
03:05:47,269 --> 03:05:47,279
what's the role of love in our
 

11091
03:05:47,279 --> 03:05:49,110
what's the role of love in our
human condition

11092
03:05:49,110 --> 03:05:49,120
human condition
 

11093
03:05:49,120 --> 03:05:51,110
human condition
this interface thing we have this is

11094
03:05:51,110 --> 03:05:51,120
this interface thing we have this is
 

11095
03:05:51,120 --> 03:05:53,590
this interface thing we have this is
this somehow interweaved interconnected

11096
03:05:53,590 --> 03:05:53,600
this somehow interweaved interconnected
 

11097
03:05:53,600 --> 03:05:55,269
this somehow interweaved interconnected
with consciousness this attachment we

11098
03:05:55,269 --> 03:05:55,279
with consciousness this attachment we
 

11099
03:05:55,279 --> 03:05:57,910
with consciousness this attachment we
have to other humans and this deep like

11100
03:05:57,910 --> 03:05:57,920
have to other humans and this deep like
 

11101
03:05:57,920 --> 03:06:00,309
have to other humans and this deep like
some um

11102
03:06:00,309 --> 03:06:00,319
some um
 

11103
03:06:00,319 --> 03:06:02,790
some um
there's some quality to it

11104
03:06:02,790 --> 03:06:02,800
there's some quality to it
 

11105
03:06:02,800 --> 03:06:04,870
there's some quality to it
that seems very

11106
03:06:04,870 --> 03:06:04,880
that seems very
 

11107
03:06:04,880 --> 03:06:07,269
that seems very
interesting peculiar

11108
03:06:07,269 --> 03:06:07,279
interesting peculiar
 

11109
03:06:07,279 --> 03:06:08,550
interesting peculiar
well

11110
03:06:08,550 --> 03:06:08,560
well
 

11111
03:06:08,560 --> 03:06:10,150
well
there are two levels i would think about

11112
03:06:10,150 --> 03:06:10,160
there are two levels i would think about
 

11113
03:06:10,160 --> 03:06:12,389
there are two levels i would think about
that there there's love in the sexual

11114
03:06:12,389 --> 03:06:12,399
that there there's love in the sexual
 

11115
03:06:12,399 --> 03:06:15,190
that there there's love in the sexual
sense and there's love in a deeper sense

11116
03:06:15,190 --> 03:06:15,200
sense and there's love in a deeper sense
 

11117
03:06:15,200 --> 03:06:17,269
sense and there's love in a deeper sense
and in the sexual sense um we can give

11118
03:06:17,269 --> 03:06:17,279
and in the sexual sense um we can give
 

11119
03:06:17,279 --> 03:06:19,429
and in the sexual sense um we can give
an evolutionary account of that and and

11120
03:06:19,429 --> 03:06:19,439
an evolutionary account of that and and
 

11121
03:06:19,439 --> 03:06:21,269
an evolutionary account of that and and
so forth and i think that's pretty clear

11122
03:06:21,269 --> 03:06:21,279
so forth and i think that's pretty clear
 

11123
03:06:21,279 --> 03:06:23,510
so forth and i think that's pretty clear
to people

11124
03:06:23,510 --> 03:06:23,520
to people
 

11125
03:06:23,520 --> 03:06:24,309
to people
um

11126
03:06:24,309 --> 03:06:24,319
um
 

11127
03:06:24,319 --> 03:06:27,269
um
in in in this deeper sense

11128
03:06:27,269 --> 03:06:27,279
in in in this deeper sense
 

11129
03:06:27,279 --> 03:06:28,950
in in in this deeper sense
right so of course

11130
03:06:28,950 --> 03:06:28,960
right so of course
 

11131
03:06:28,960 --> 03:06:31,590
right so of course
you're married you're i love my wife in

11132
03:06:31,590 --> 03:06:31,600
you're married you're i love my wife in
 

11133
03:06:31,600 --> 03:06:32,870
you're married you're i love my wife in
a sexual sense but there's a deeper

11134
03:06:32,870 --> 03:06:32,880
a sexual sense but there's a deeper
 

11135
03:06:32,880 --> 03:06:34,389
a sexual sense but there's a deeper
sense as well that when i was saying

11136
03:06:34,389 --> 03:06:34,399
sense as well that when i was saying
 

11137
03:06:34,399 --> 03:06:35,830
sense as well that when i was saying
goodbye to her there was a there was a

11138
03:06:35,830 --> 03:06:35,840
goodbye to her there was a there was a
 

11139
03:06:35,840 --> 03:06:37,670
goodbye to her there was a there was a
deeper much deeper love that was really

11140
03:06:37,670 --> 03:06:37,680
deeper much deeper love that was really
 

11141
03:06:37,680 --> 03:06:39,269
deeper much deeper love that was really
at play there that's one place where i

11142
03:06:39,269 --> 03:06:39,279
at play there that's one place where i
 

11143
03:06:39,279 --> 03:06:40,630
at play there that's one place where i
think

11144
03:06:40,630 --> 03:06:40,640
think
 

11145
03:06:40,640 --> 03:06:42,630
think
that the mixed bag from spiritual

11146
03:06:42,630 --> 03:06:42,640
that the mixed bag from spiritual
 

11147
03:06:42,640 --> 03:06:44,230
that the mixed bag from spiritual
traditions has something right when they

11148
03:06:44,230 --> 03:06:44,240
traditions has something right when they
 

11149
03:06:44,240 --> 03:06:45,670
traditions has something right when they
say you know love your neighbor as

11150

yourself that that some in some sense
 

11153
03:06:47,520 --> 03:06:49,269
yourself that that some in some sense
love is fundamental

11154
03:06:49,269 --> 03:06:49,279
love is fundamental
 

11155
03:06:49,279 --> 03:06:51,750
love is fundamental
i think that they're on to something

11156
03:06:51,750 --> 03:06:51,760
i think that they're on to something
 

11157
03:06:51,760 --> 03:06:54,710
i think that they're on to something
something very very deep and profound

11158
03:06:54,710 --> 03:06:54,720
something very very deep and profound
 

11159
03:06:54,720 --> 03:06:56,630
something very very deep and profound
and

11160
03:06:56,630 --> 03:06:56,640
and
 

11161
03:06:56,640 --> 03:06:57,990
and
every most of all i can get a personal

11162
03:06:57,990 --> 03:06:58,000
every most of all i can get a personal
 

11163
03:06:58,000 --> 03:06:59,269
every most of all i can get a personal
glimpse of that when i especially when

11164
03:06:59,269 --> 03:06:59,279
glimpse of that when i especially when
 

11165
03:06:59,279 --> 03:07:01,750
glimpse of that when i especially when
i'm in the

11166
03:07:01,750 --> 03:07:01,760

 

11167

space with no thought

11168
03:07:03,590 --> 03:07:03,600
space with no thought
 

11169
03:07:03,600 --> 03:07:05,269

i get little glimpses of
 

11175
03:07:09,680 --> 03:07:11,269
i get little glimpses of
of a love in the sense that i'm not

11176
03:07:11,269 --> 03:07:11,279
of a love in the sense that i'm not

common
 

11209
03:07:41,760 --> 03:07:43,590
common
thing at the core

11210
03:07:43,590 --> 03:07:43,600
thing at the core
 

11211
03:07:43,600 --> 03:07:47,349
thing at the core
oh well in in many

11212
03:07:47,349 --> 03:07:47,359
oh well in in many

we tend to think of god

11220
03:07:56,710 --> 03:07:56,720
we tend to think of god
 

11221
03:07:56,720 --> 03:07:59,910
we tend to think of god
as a being

11222
03:07:59,910 --> 03:07:59,920

 

11223
03:07:59,920 --> 03:08:01,110

but i think that

11224
03:08:01,110 --> 03:08:01,120
but i think that
 

11225
03:08:01,120 --> 03:08:02,710
but i think that
that's not right

11226
03:08:02,710 --> 03:08:02,720
that's not right
 

11227
03:08:02,720 --> 03:08:03,590
that's not right
i think

11228
03:08:03,590 --> 03:08:03,600
i think
 

11229
03:08:03,600 --> 03:08:05,990
i think
the closest way to think about god is

11230
03:08:05,990 --> 03:08:06,000
the closest way to think about god is
 

11231
03:08:06,000 --> 03:08:08,230
the closest way to think about god is
being period not a being but

11232
03:08:08,230 --> 03:08:08,240
being period not a being but
 

11233
03:08:08,240 --> 03:08:09,269
being period not a being but
being

11234
03:08:09,269 --> 03:08:09,279
being
 

11235
03:08:09,279 --> 03:08:12,309
being
the very ground of being itself is god i

11236
03:08:12,309 --> 03:08:12,319
the very ground of being itself is god i
 

11237
03:08:12,319 --> 03:08:13,910
the very ground of being itself is god i
think that's the

11238
03:08:13,910 --> 03:08:13,920
think that's the
 

11239
03:08:13,920 --> 03:08:16,150
think that's the
the deep and from my point of view

11240
03:08:16,150 --> 03:08:16,160
the deep and from my point of view
 

11241
03:08:16,160 --> 03:08:17,830
the deep and from my point of view
that's the ground of consciousness so

11242
03:08:17,830 --> 03:08:17,840
that's the ground of consciousness so
 

11243
03:08:17,840 --> 03:08:21,110
that's the ground of consciousness so
the ground of conscious being is

11244
03:08:21,110 --> 03:08:21,120
the ground of conscious being is
 

11245
03:08:21,120 --> 03:08:23,110
the ground of conscious being is
what we might call god but but the word

11259
03:08:35,200 --> 03:08:37,349
call god is different from the being
that i call god and so we fight whereas

the spiritual traditions that point to

11278
03:08:55,830 --> 03:08:55,840
the spiritual traditions that point to
 

11279
03:08:55,840 --> 03:08:57,110
the spiritual traditions that point to
that

11280
03:08:57,110 --> 03:08:57,120
that
 

11281
03:08:57,120 --> 03:08:58,790
that
i think are pointing

11282
03:08:58,790 --> 03:08:58,800
i think are pointing
 

11283
03:08:58,800 --> 03:09:01,349
i think are pointing
it in a very interesting direction and

11284
03:09:01,349 --> 03:09:01,359
it in a very interesting direction and
 

11285
03:09:01,359 --> 03:09:03,590
it in a very interesting direction and
that does seem to

11286
03:09:03,590 --> 03:09:03,600
that does seem to
 

11287
03:09:03,600 --> 03:09:04,870
that does seem to
match with the mathematics of the

11288
03:09:04,870 --> 03:09:04,880
match with the mathematics of the
 

11289
03:09:04,880 --> 03:09:06,389
match with the mathematics of the
conscious agent stuff that i've been

11290
03:09:06,389 --> 03:09:06,399
conscious agent stuff that i've been
 

11291
03:09:06,399 --> 03:09:08,230
conscious agent stuff that i've been
working on as well that

11292
03:09:08,230 --> 03:09:08,240
working on as well that
 

11293
03:09:08,240 --> 03:09:10,309
working on as well that
it really fits with that although that

11294
03:09:10,309 --> 03:09:10,319
it really fits with that although that
 

11295
03:09:10,319 --> 03:09:11,510
it really fits with that although that
wasn't my goal

11296
03:09:11,510 --> 03:09:11,520
wasn't my goal

you mentioned that the young physicists
that um you talk to or whose work you

11302

that um you talk to or whose work you
 

11303

creating other other data structures
 

11389
03:10:45,359 --> 03:10:48,150
creating other other data structures
they're authors of various other things

11390
03:10:48,150 --> 03:10:48,160
they're authors of various other things
 

11391
03:10:48,160 --> 03:10:50,469
they're authors of various other things
so so realizing and then realizing that

03:10:54,790 --> 03:10:54,800
going and called
 

11399
03:10:54,800 --> 03:10:56,229
going and called
reading all these textbooks oh man it's

11400
03:10:56,229 --> 03:10:56,239
reading all these textbooks oh man it's
 

11401
03:10:56,239 --> 03:10:58,070
reading all these textbooks oh man it's
all been done

11402
03:10:58,070 --> 03:10:58,080
all been done
 

11403

yeah
if i'd just been there you know 50 years

11406
03:11:00,309 --> 03:11:00,319
if i'd just been there you know 50 years
 

11407
03:11:00,319 --> 03:11:01,429
if i'd just been there you know 50 years
ago i could have discovered this stuff

11408
03:11:01,429 --> 03:11:01,439
ago i could have discovered this stuff
 

11409
03:11:01,439 --> 03:11:02,469
ago i could have discovered this stuff
but the you know it's all in the

but the you know it's all in the
 

11411
03:11:02,479 --> 03:11:03,670
but the you know it's all in the
textbooks now

11412
03:11:03,670 --> 03:11:03,680
textbooks now
 

11413
03:11:03,680 --> 03:11:04,950
textbooks now
well

11414
03:11:04,950 --> 03:11:04,960
well
 

11415
03:11:04,960 --> 03:11:06,630
well
believe me the textbooks are going to

11416
03:11:06,630 --> 03:11:06,640
believe me the textbooks are going to
 

11417
03:11:06,640 --> 03:11:08,790
believe me the textbooks are going to
look silly in 50 years

11418
03:11:08,790 --> 03:11:08,800
look silly in 50 years
 

11419
03:11:08,800 --> 03:11:10,309
look silly in 50 years
and it's your chan your chance to write

11420
03:11:10,309 --> 03:11:10,319
and it's your chan your chance to write
 

11421
03:11:10,319 --> 03:11:12,950
and it's your chan your chance to write
the new textbook so so

11422
03:11:12,950 --> 03:11:12,960
the new textbook so so
 

11423
03:11:12,960 --> 03:11:14,550
the new textbook so so
of course study the current textbooks

11424
03:11:14,550 --> 03:11:14,560
of course study the current textbooks
 

11425
03:11:14,560 --> 03:11:16,070
of course study the current textbooks
you have to understand them you there's

11426
03:11:16,070 --> 03:11:16,080
you have to understand them you there's
 

11427
03:11:16,080 --> 03:11:19,030
you have to understand them you there's
no way to progress until you understand

11428
03:11:19,030 --> 03:11:19,040
no way to progress until you understand
 

11429
03:11:19,040 --> 03:11:20,630
no way to progress until you understand
what's been done

11430
03:11:20,630 --> 03:11:20,640
what's been done
 

11431
03:11:20,640 --> 03:11:23,269
what's been done
but but then

11432
03:11:23,269 --> 03:11:23,279
but but then
 

11433
03:11:23,279 --> 03:11:25,030
but but then
the only limit is your imagination

11434
03:11:25,030 --> 03:11:25,040
the only limit is your imagination
 

11435
03:11:25,040 --> 03:11:26,870
the only limit is your imagination
frankly that's the only limit the

11436
03:11:26,870 --> 03:11:26,880
frankly that's the only limit the
 

11437
03:11:26,880 --> 03:11:29,030
frankly that's the only limit the
greatest books the greatest textbooks

11438
03:11:29,030 --> 03:11:29,040
greatest books the greatest textbooks
 

11439
03:11:29,040 --> 03:11:31,269
greatest books the greatest textbooks
ever written on earth are yet to be

11440
03:11:31,269 --> 03:11:31,279
ever written on earth are yet to be
 

11441
03:11:31,279 --> 03:11:33,910
ever written on earth are yet to be
written exactly

11442
03:11:33,910 --> 03:11:33,920
written exactly
 

11443
03:11:33,920 --> 03:11:34,870
written exactly
uh

11444
03:11:34,870 --> 03:11:34,880
uh
 

11445
03:11:34,880 --> 03:11:35,990
uh
what do you think is the meaning of this

11446
03:11:35,990 --> 03:11:36,000
what do you think is the meaning of this
 

11447
03:11:36,000 --> 03:11:38,389
what do you think is the meaning of this
whole thing what's the meaning of life

11448
03:11:38,389 --> 03:11:38,399
whole thing what's the meaning of life
 

11449
03:11:38,399 --> 03:11:40,469
whole thing what's the meaning of life
from your limited interface can you can

11450
03:11:40,469 --> 03:11:40,479
from your limited interface can you can
 

11451
03:11:40,479 --> 03:11:42,790
from your limited interface can you can
you can you figure it all out like why

11452
03:11:42,790 --> 03:11:42,800
you can you figure it all out like why
 

11453
03:11:42,800 --> 03:11:45,349
you can you figure it all out like why
why so you said the universe is kind of

11454
03:11:45,349 --> 03:11:45,359
why so you said the universe is kind of
 

11455
03:11:45,359 --> 03:11:46,950
why so you said the universe is kind of
trying to figure itself out through

11456
03:11:46,950 --> 03:11:46,960
trying to figure itself out through
 

11457
03:11:46,960 --> 03:11:48,070
trying to figure itself out through
through us

11458
03:11:48,070 --> 03:11:48,080
through us
 

11459
03:11:48,080 --> 03:11:53,750
through us
uh why why

11460
03:11:53,750 --> 03:11:53,760

 

11461
03:11:53,760 --> 03:11:57,030

yeah that's the closest i've come so

11462
03:11:57,030 --> 03:11:57,040
yeah that's the closest i've come so
 

11463
03:11:57,040 --> 03:11:59,110
yeah that's the closest i've come so
i'll give you so i

11464
03:11:59,110 --> 03:11:59,120
i'll give you so i
 

11465
03:11:59,120 --> 03:12:01,429
i'll give you so i
will say that i don't know but but but

11466
03:12:01,429 --> 03:12:01,439
will say that i don't know but but but
 

11467
03:12:01,439 --> 03:12:03,030
will say that i don't know but but but
i'll here's my guess right that's a good

11468
03:12:03,030 --> 03:12:03,040
i'll here's my guess right that's a good
 

11469
03:12:03,040 --> 03:12:04,630
i'll here's my guess right that's a good
first sentence that's a good starting

11470
03:12:04,630 --> 03:12:04,640
first sentence that's a good starting
 

11471
03:12:04,640 --> 03:12:07,110
first sentence that's a good starting
point and and maybe that's

11472
03:12:07,110 --> 03:12:07,120
point and and maybe that's
 

11473
03:12:07,120 --> 03:12:08,870
point and and maybe that's
going to be a profound part of the final

11474
03:12:08,870 --> 03:12:08,880
going to be a profound part of the final
 

11475
03:12:08,880 --> 03:12:10,710
going to be a profound part of the final
answer is to start with the i don't know

11476
03:12:10,710 --> 03:12:10,720
answer is to start with the i don't know
 

11477
03:12:10,720 --> 03:12:12,790
answer is to start with the i don't know
it's quite possible that that

11478
03:12:12,790 --> 03:12:12,800
it's quite possible that that
 

11479
03:12:12,800 --> 03:12:13,990
it's quite possible that that
that's really important to start with

11480
03:12:13,990 --> 03:12:14,000
that's really important to start with
 

11481
03:12:14,000 --> 03:12:15,429
that's really important to start with
the i don't know

11482
03:12:15,429 --> 03:12:15,439
the i don't know
 

11483
03:12:15,439 --> 03:12:17,190
the i don't know
my guess is that if consciousness is

11484
03:12:17,190 --> 03:12:17,200
my guess is that if consciousness is
 

11485
03:12:17,200 --> 03:12:18,389
my guess is that if consciousness is
fundamental

11486
03:12:18,389 --> 03:12:18,399
fundamental
 

11487
03:12:18,399 --> 03:12:20,389
fundamental
and of girdle girdles and completeness

11488
03:12:20,389 --> 03:12:20,399
and of girdle girdles and completeness
 

11489
03:12:20,399 --> 03:12:21,670
and of girdle girdles and completeness
theorem

11490
03:12:21,670 --> 03:12:21,680
theorem
 

11491
03:12:21,680 --> 03:12:22,790
theorem
holds here

11492
03:12:22,790 --> 03:12:22,800
holds here
 

11493
03:12:22,800 --> 03:12:25,510
holds here
and there's infinite variety of

11494
03:12:25,510 --> 03:12:25,520
and there's infinite variety of
 

11495
03:12:25,520 --> 03:12:27,429
and there's infinite variety of

11496
03:12:27,429 --> 03:12:27,439
structures
 

11497
03:12:27,439 --> 03:12:31,269
structures
for consciousness to some sense explore

11498
03:12:31,269 --> 03:12:31,279
for consciousness to some sense explore
 

11499
03:12:31,279 --> 03:12:34,070
for consciousness to some sense explore
um

11500
03:12:34,070 --> 03:12:34,080

 

11501
03:12:34,080 --> 03:12:36,070

that maybe that's

11502
03:12:36,070 --> 03:12:36,080
that maybe that's
 

11503
03:12:36,080 --> 03:12:37,910
that maybe that's
what it's about this is something that

11504
03:12:37,910 --> 03:12:37,920
what it's about this is something that
 

11505
03:12:37,920 --> 03:12:39,190
what it's about this is something that
anika and i talked about a little bit

11506
03:12:39,190 --> 03:12:39,200
anika and i talked about a little bit
 

11507
03:12:39,200 --> 03:12:40,389
anika and i talked about a little bit
and she doesn't like this way of talking

11508
03:12:40,389 --> 03:12:40,399
and she doesn't like this way of talking
 

11509
03:12:40,399 --> 03:12:42,150
and she doesn't like this way of talking
about it so i'm gonna have to talk with

11510
03:12:42,150 --> 03:12:42,160
about it so i'm gonna have to talk with
 

11511
03:12:42,160 --> 03:12:43,910
about it so i'm gonna have to talk with
some more about this way of talking but

11512
03:12:43,910 --> 03:12:43,920
some more about this way of talking but
 

11513
03:12:43,920 --> 03:12:45,349
some more about this way of talking but
right now i'll just put it this way and

11514
03:12:45,349 --> 03:12:45,359
right now i'll just put it this way and
 

11515
03:12:45,359 --> 03:12:46,790
right now i'll just put it this way and
i'll have to talk with her more and see

11516
03:12:46,790 --> 03:12:46,800
i'll have to talk with her more and see
 

11517
03:12:46,800 --> 03:12:48,790
i'll have to talk with her more and see
if i can say it more clearly

11518
03:12:48,790 --> 03:12:48,800
if i can say it more clearly
 

11519
03:12:48,800 --> 03:12:50,469
if i can say it more clearly
but the way i

11520
03:12:50,469 --> 03:12:50,479
but the way i
 

11521
03:12:50,479 --> 03:12:55,590
but the way i
i'm talking about it now is that

11522
03:12:55,590 --> 03:12:55,600

 

11523
03:12:55,600 --> 03:12:58,070

there's a sense in which

11524
03:12:58,070 --> 03:12:58,080
there's a sense in which
 

11525
03:12:58,080 --> 03:13:01,510
there's a sense in which
there's being

11526
03:13:01,510 --> 03:13:01,520

 

11527
03:13:01,520 --> 03:13:03,349

and then there's the experiences or

11528
03:13:03,349 --> 03:13:03,359
and then there's the experiences or
 

11529
03:13:03,359 --> 03:13:05,510
and then there's the experiences or
forums that come out of being

11530
03:13:05,510 --> 03:13:05,520
forums that come out of being
 

11531
03:13:05,520 --> 03:13:09,670
forums that come out of being
that's one deep deep mystery

11571
03:13:47,200 --> 03:13:49,429

all i can guess right now

11572
03:13:49,429 --> 03:13:49,439
all i can guess right now
 

11573
03:13:49,439 --> 03:13:51,269
all i can guess right now
and i'll probably kick myself in a

11574
03:13:51,269 --> 03:13:51,279
and i'll probably kick myself in a
 

11575
03:13:51,279 --> 03:13:52,710
and i'll probably kick myself in a
couple years and say that was dumb but

11576
03:13:52,710 --> 03:13:52,720
couple years and say that was dumb but
 

11577
03:13:52,720 --> 03:13:54,150
couple years and say that was dumb but
but all i can guess right now is that

11578
03:13:54,150 --> 03:13:54,160
but all i can guess right now is that
 

11579
03:13:54,160 --> 03:13:56,309
but all i can guess right now is that
somehow

11580
03:13:56,309 --> 03:13:56,319
somehow
 

11581
03:13:56,319 --> 03:13:57,910
somehow
consciousness wakes up to itself by

11582
03:13:57,910 --> 03:13:57,920
consciousness wakes up to itself by
 

11583
03:13:57,920 --> 03:13:59,830
consciousness wakes up to itself by
knowing what it's not

11584
03:13:59,830 --> 03:13:59,840
knowing what it's not
 

11585
03:13:59,840 --> 03:14:02,870
knowing what it's not
so here i am i'm not this body

11589
03:14:05,279 --> 03:14:07,510
and i sort of saw that
it was sort of in my face when i

11590
03:14:07,510 --> 03:14:07,520
it was sort of in my face when i
 

11591
03:14:07,520 --> 03:14:10,229
it was sort of in my face when i
sent a text goodbye but then as soon as

a year ago so
that comes rushing back so

11610
03:14:27,910 --> 03:14:27,920
that comes rushing back so
 

11611
03:14:27,920 --> 03:14:30,790
that comes rushing back so
so consciousness immerses itself

11612
03:14:30,790 --> 03:14:30,800
so consciousness immerses itself
 

11613
03:14:30,800 --> 03:14:32,389
so consciousness immerses itself
fully

11614
03:14:32,389 --> 03:14:32,399
fully
 

11615
03:14:32,399 --> 03:14:34,389

03:14:37,030 --> 03:14:37,040
a particular headset
 

11619
03:14:37,040 --> 03:14:38,790
a particular headset
gets lost in it

11620
03:14:38,790 --> 03:14:38,800
gets lost in it
 

11621
03:14:38,800 --> 03:14:40,950
gets lost in it
and then slowly wakes up just so it can

11622
03:14:40,950 --> 03:14:40,960
and then slowly wakes up just so it can
 

11623
03:14:40,960 --> 03:14:42,710
and then slowly wakes up just so it can
escape and that is the waking up but he

11624
03:14:42,710 --> 03:14:42,720
escape and that is the waking up but he
 

11625
03:14:42,720 --> 03:14:45,429
